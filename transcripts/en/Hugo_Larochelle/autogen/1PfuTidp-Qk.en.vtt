00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.899
 this capsule we will see the syntax of 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:08.849
 the logic of the first rank so as one 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.099
 saw in logic the first rendering to two 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:14.190
 aspects that we will have to explore for 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:18.449
 to be able to make inference 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:21.390
 logic actually in this capsule if this 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.890
 that we look at and it's specifically the 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.660
 syntax to know how were we 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.029
 will be able to express in logical forms 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.310
 first-rate facts that darkens and 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.580
 that they describe our our 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.580
 environment 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.780
 so I started with a course 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.110
 fast of the different concepts that we are going 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.480
 have to review logical first flight 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.110
 so an expression in logic of the 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.739
 first round 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.899
 we will call it a formula a formula 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:52.620
 is going to be actually a combination of a 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:54.210
 or multiple credits cases predicates 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.940
 in front of a handset using 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:00.180
 logical connectors to help or a site 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:03.690
 web or quantifies catr as he 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.250
 exists or for all prices says core 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.380
 every medicine from yves to 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:12.270
 describe forgiveness of the facts that are going to be 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:14.130
 true or false so in fact a predicate goes 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.080
 determine what something that is 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.280
 true and then in the game it's some 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.869
 thing that they actually do it at the 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:23.909
 negation of a predica and so all these 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:28.200
 small clubs will correspond to 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:29.729
 relationships between objects most of the 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.579
 time sometimes the decrypts predicates 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.409
 other objects even often do it 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.990
 predicts that to see arguments that will 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.920
 match objects objects in 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.509
 question 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:44.009
 sell cries using terms and the 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:48.270
 baths at the port is a two three 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:50.399
 things are of a constant like in 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.250
 the example of rome caesar or marcus 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:55.350
 would be constants 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:57.270
 it'll be able to be a variable either in 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.850
 kitchen held tiny like x or y 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.790
 but in this case it is not specified 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:06.000
 not exactly what the object is 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:08.129
 in question so we will be able to make 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.950
 reasonings of it existed x or for 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:13.250
 all and there 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:15.800
 and he also possibly see as 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:18.230
 term of the functions applied to others 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.330
 terms so we could wonder about 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:24.110
 we could refer to for 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:25.400
 markus in the left leg of marcus and 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.930
 so the function because that's what 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.640
 would be left leg that take a 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.440
 argument that must be reborn a term 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.970
 who in this example if it's marcus is 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:36.019
 it would refer to the left leg 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:37.970
 of marcus then obviously all that is 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:39.560
 near the canto logical pass quantifies them 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:45.290
 sensors and terms we will describe them 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:46.940
 using symbols the symbols we 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.160
 will use I'm going to use a 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.630
 certain convention among others by name 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.130
 for some of these symbols by 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:55.670
 example for constants 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:58.400
 it could be a number or a word and 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.840
 the first letter of the world on the way 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.110
 normal the soul and in capital letters 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:06.110
 to distinguish variables that are going to 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:08.870
 be raised to tiny then 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:10.160
 functions that will also be described 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.019
 stop the first letter 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.870
 normally will use a letter 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:18.230
 tiny and a function is going to have some 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:20.930
 arguments and gold later the wind say 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:24.230
 more about the relationship of the function and 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:25.850
 his arguments when also we talked 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:27.980
 close to the body noticed that a price 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:29.840
 of the cac is not a theme 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.910
 so constants and functions 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.430
 are terms the variables too but 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:36.319
 not the predicates the predicates by 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:38.120
 against in the air have looked a lot like 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:40.940
 to functions that happens to be a word 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.690
 then often see parentheses that goes 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.359
 identify 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:45.950
 surrounded the arguments of the predicted one 

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:49.190
 may have against the prices of kop 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:53.450
 blood without arguments so we max 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:55.280
 that no argument to the predicates so 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:57.200
 the number of arguments is of a 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:01.430
 function or a predica that's what we 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:03.950
 will call to stop him and noticed that 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:05.750
 it's very important the predicates this does not 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:06.970
 are not functions ie that 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:09.680
 it is 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:11.450
 conceptually incorrect to think or 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.739
 to see the predicates as sandy 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:14.060
 functions that they return values 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:16.400
 binary really do not know if he plays a 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:18.680
 role that is fundamental and that is 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:21.200
 different predicates play a role 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:23.190
 different fundamental and we will have to 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:25.170
 treated differently from control 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.870
 predica it's not a term while a 

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:29.300
 function it's a term 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:33.840
 and when we see other examples 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:35.310
 this notion of rest more so the role 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.230
 fundamental predicates actually it's 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:38.580
 that they are at the base of the forms a 

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:40.410
 formula it's a combination of 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:43.770
 predicates his good combinations of 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:44.760
 then function variables often 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:46.470
 for the variables 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:49.710
 we will use tiny letters 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:52.260
 only one letter for reference 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:55.470
 barriers for the symbol to master 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:58.220
 finally the connectors for the 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:01.290
 negation will use this symbol too 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:04.020
 its symbols there for the conjunction the i 

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:06.510
 this symbol for blue disjunction or 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:10.080
 is this symbol if the arrow for 

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:12.090
 involvement and quantifies them catr the 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:17.600
 to master everything upside down and 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:25.860
 for the church it's an e per year but 

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:28.980
 reflecting then we talked about term so 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:30.390
 constants are terms and the 

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:31.860
 variables are also terms 

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:33.690
 when I speak of a term of care I 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:37.230
 speaks of a constant or a variable 

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:40.080
 I can also talk about a function that 

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:42.750
 will be applied to one or more 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:46.230
 terms so the application of a function 

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:47.430
 terms will also be a term to 

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:50.490
 to take otherwise if we had several 

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:53.580
 terms t1 until tng we have a 

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:58.169
 function that will equip one who take 

00:05:53.580 --> 00:06:02.400
 arguments that inherited from nf2 t1 

00:05:58.169 --> 00:06:04.080
 until tnc at the cemetery so for example 

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:06.810
 john strand term because it's a 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:10.620
 constant well john's father so the 

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:13.350
 function by applying to the constant 

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:16.140
 jones is also a term by x is a 

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:19.890
 theme too or 6 x here and that's a 

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:21.930
 variable and then father whose prat in 

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:23.370
 input as argument a term since 

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:25.440
 father of the ex is also a term on 

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:27.660
 could scare you to lose 

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:31.050
 xcom this would probably refer 

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:33.030
 grandfather of x in a base of 

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:35.910
 knowledge 

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:39.630
 in fact the functions could the 

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:42.410
 avoid by defining a constant for 

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:45.210
 every possible argument of the function 

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:47.970
 so if we had a father function and 

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:50.970
 then we had two observations john 

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:52.980
 and louis comes for and instead just 

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:56.130
 define a constant father john then a 

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:58.230
 constant father louis ok so that would be 

00:06:56.130 --> 00:07:00.240
 another way of modeling a 

00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:02.370
 environment we have john and louis then 

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:04.770
 everyone loses we could just have some 

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:07.080
 separate constants for john's father 

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:08.550
 and the father louis by cons we're going 

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:11.670
 to lose is the possibility of reasoning 

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:13.170
 in general with variables on 

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:15.960
 the relationship of these different functions 

00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:18.270
 something that matters that we can 

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:21.860
 do with functions it is noted 

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:28.950
 something like that his brother ex y 

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:30.750
 implies that ego eg ex loses ex 

00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:34.950
 let's not think about it that's what said 

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:36.450
 what it says is that the 6 x and y are 

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:39.360
 brothers 

00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:41.460
 but we do not have to do x so here it is 

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:45.450
 it's really a function also 

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:47.850
 by experts from there are equal and 

00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:51.330
 notice if ego his brother are 

00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:53.520
 predicates since it is they are part 

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:56.280
 of a formula he has a formula where we have 

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:58.110
 combined the predicate his brother ego had 

00:07:56.280 --> 00:08:00.420
 among other things, the implication for 

00:07:58.110 --> 00:08:02.760
 use the quantifies catr universal 

00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:04.760
 and for all here so his ego brother are 

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:07.800
 prices said here while fathers 

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:09.420
 are functions in this case and 

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:11.790
 that's why we can put them in 

00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:13.770
 argument to a loan of the body one does not 

00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:15.570
 could not put as argument of 

00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:17.160
 close to the body another predicts like 

00:08:15.570 --> 00:08:18.720
 precisely because a price says core 

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:20.340
 it's not just a function that 

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:24.240
 return ball is really something 

00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:25.200
 separate thing and whose trip with 

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:26.580
 this formula we are able 

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:28.500
 finally to reason so 

00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:30.330
 on the function of the father in 

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:32.250
 determining that his name the price of the co 

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:34.410
 his brother xy ben actually is that the 

00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:36.270
 by ex no direction and tasting 

00:08:34.410 --> 00:08:38.580
 discussion had had fathers john 

00:08:36.270 --> 00:08:40.570
 beyrle yes and if next there will be done 

00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:43.690
 their listeners 

00:08:40.570 --> 00:08:46.480
 it was necessary to have separate predicates 

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:49.060
 for every possible value excess of y 

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:50.920
 so every possible constant for who 

00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:52.690
 refers to the father of each 

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:55.560
 constant every person in our 

00:08:52.690 --> 00:08:55.560
 environment 

00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:01.720
 so now for non formulas 

00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:03.430
 a little more in detail so the 

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:07.410
 simplest formula it's a single 

00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:11.170
 predica so a predicate is a formula 

00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:13.450
 is specifically if we have t1 terms 

00:09:11.170 --> 00:09:14.830
 until tn since we learned from the cope 

00:09:13.450 --> 00:09:16.660
 who at n 

00:09:14.830 --> 00:09:20.290
 argument that is an inheritance from 

00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:22.380
 hate and well p2 t1 until tn it's a 

00:09:20.290 --> 00:09:25.270
 formula is the simplest formula 

00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:27.850
 now if we negate the 

00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:30.610
 conjunction the disjunction or 

00:09:27.850 --> 00:09:32.500
 the formula implication we get 

00:09:30.610 --> 00:09:36.430
 also a formula that is to say that are 

00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:40.660
 the alfa-beta form well the negation of 

00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:45.820
 alpha so no alpha or alpha and beta or 

00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:48.790
 alpha or beta and alpha implies beta 

00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:50.380
 are all formulas also the 

00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:52.780
 universal quantification the 

00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:54.730
 existential quantification of a formula 

00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:57.880
 or it is a formula that is to say that 

00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:58.690
 if alpha and a formula I know that 

00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:02.230
 it's a variable 

00:09:58.690 --> 00:10:07.630
 if I write for all x alpha and he 

00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:09.430
 exists x alpha so these are two of 

00:10:07.630 --> 00:10:10.660
 things there are actually formulas so 

00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:12.940
 to stir up that does it said that 

00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:14.770
 for any value of x half way should 

00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:19.030
 so in the must have probably 

00:10:14.770 --> 00:10:22.990
 a predicate with precisely 

00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:29.530
 inside the variable x so that's it 

00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:31.300
 could be I do not know me person x 

00:10:29.530 --> 00:10:32.740
 lx to be that so for all ex 

00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:36.730
 nobody is that it's true that everything 

00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:38.710
 all the possible constants 

00:10:36.730 --> 00:10:41.650
 of the possible item x is a person 

00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:44.500
 that there are six alfassa says that he 

00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:47.670
 exists a value of x as predicted 

00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:47.670
 that alpha is true 

00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:53.830
 since we have operators we have to 

00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:55.930
 determine their priorities 

00:10:53.830 --> 00:10:59.650
 so when priority is the negation 

00:10:55.930 --> 00:11:01.900
 survival of and where and involvement 

00:10:59.650 --> 00:11:08.980
 what that means among other things 

00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:10.690
 that the negation of alpha and beta that 

00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:13.330
 actually corresponds to negate 

00:11:10.690 --> 00:11:16.060
 before of alfort then of his 

00:11:13.330 --> 00:11:20.380
 to have the conjunction of the negation of 

00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:26.220
 alpha and beta so that does not fit 

00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:28.570
 to his something different 

00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:31.090
 it does not correspond to that because the 

00:11:28.570 --> 00:11:33.880
 denial to priorities on the 

00:11:31.090 --> 00:11:35.170
 conjunction for oneself this is an example 

00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:37.210
 who could do other examples 

00:11:35.170 --> 00:11:39.370
 with the priorities of operations are 

00:11:37.210 --> 00:11:41.020
 similar concepts that's already seen 

00:11:39.370 --> 00:11:45.490
 probably in programming language 

00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:47.440
 the notion of priority is used 

00:11:45.490 --> 00:11:48.670
 parentheses the same way as in 

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:50.760
 arithmetic expressions in 

00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:53.110
 just programming to properly determine 

00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:54.070
 control their application of 

00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:57.490
 different operations 

00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:59.530
 and in terms of quantifying they 

00:11:57.490 --> 00:12:02.680
 will apply to the whole formula to 

00:11:59.530 --> 00:12:08.470
 their right so among others for all 

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:11.140
 explains sue qxc implies fx that would be 

00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:14.080
 equivalent to that here ie for 

00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:16.960
 all x in parenthesis all these formulas 

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:19.630
 there and that would not be equivalent to for 

00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:22.030
 all shipped x or would return it the 

00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:24.700
 parenthesis here or what is it implies 

00:12:22.030 --> 00:12:28.540
 an x so that's not the good 

00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:30.420
 interpretation of this here this is the 

00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:32.650
 good interpretation 

00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:36.130
 one way to see that in fact is that 

00:12:32.650 --> 00:12:38.850
 to say that quantify them an order of 

00:12:36.130 --> 00:12:41.530
 priority when prioritizing the most beautiful 

00:12:38.850 --> 00:12:45.400
 is finally some equivalence that 

00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:47.730
 you probably already know that 

00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:50.470
 you already learn from other classes 

00:12:47.730 --> 00:12:53.890
 alpha or beta it's actually equivalent to 

00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:56.350
 negation of the negation of alfort and 

00:12:53.890 --> 00:12:57.850
 the negation of beta is because we 

00:12:56.350 --> 00:13:00.730
 can distribute the negation to 

00:12:57.850 --> 00:13:02.480
 inside the parenthesis is the 

00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:05.180
 negation applied to a 

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:07.100
 conjunction becomes the disjunction of the 

00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:09.980
 negation of the two arguments ie 

00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:12.230
 that the negation of all this is the 

00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:16.130
 negation of the negation of alpha so 

00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:18.649
 it's alpha or the negation of the 

00:13:16.130 --> 00:13:20.870
 negation of beta so that happens beta 

00:13:18.649 --> 00:13:23.089
 we did have alpha or beta 

00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:25.730
 equivalent here is another 

00:13:23.089 --> 00:13:28.639
 alpha equivalency implies beta is 

00:13:25.730 --> 00:13:30.440
 equivalent to the negation of alpha or 

00:13:28.639 --> 00:13:32.389
 beta that's really something that 

00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:34.820
 you have seen to sell it's a course of 

00:13:32.389 --> 00:13:38.839
 discrete mathematics for example and 

00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:40.820
 finally there exists v alpha so exile 

00:13:38.839 --> 00:13:43.639
 a life value such as alpha is 

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:46.850
 equivalent to the negation of to find 

00:13:43.639 --> 00:13:49.490
 the negation of alpha so to say that there 

00:13:46.850 --> 00:13:50.870
 exist a life pain such as alpha 

00:13:49.490 --> 00:13:54.079
 it's the same as saying that he 

00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:57.529
 does not exist that it's not true that for 

00:13:54.079 --> 00:14:00.800
 to open you do not have to do it and so 

00:13:57.529 --> 00:14:02.329
 the interest of these equivalences there 

00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:05.199
 is that it converts all 

00:14:02.329 --> 00:14:07.339
 dysfunctions in a conjunction of 

00:14:05.199 --> 00:14:10.519
 to remove all the implications for 

00:14:07.339 --> 00:14:12.050
 get a disjunction that she can 

00:14:10.519 --> 00:14:15.019
 to be converted once again into a 

00:14:12.050 --> 00:14:17.389
 conjunction and then this equivalent ci 

00:14:15.019 --> 00:14:18.949
 allows to eliminate all quantifying 

00:14:17.389 --> 00:14:25.279
 existential to get some 

00:14:18.949 --> 00:14:27.019
 quantifying universal and for all then 

00:14:25.279 --> 00:14:28.250
 let's do a little exercise to see 

00:14:27.019 --> 00:14:29.959
 concretely how can we 

00:14:28.250 --> 00:14:31.579
 take defy natural language then 

00:14:29.959 --> 00:14:34.600
 first-order logical formulas 

00:14:31.579 --> 00:14:37.540
 so let's go back to our example of Rome 

00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:39.829
 in first order logic 

00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:44.060
 marcus is a person one could 

00:14:39.829 --> 00:14:46.459
 write it as being marcus the price of 

00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:48.260
 co mercus in parenthesis of which pardon the 

00:14:46.459 --> 00:14:51.260
 predicted as a parenthetical person 

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:53.120
 marcus so here marcus is a constant 

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:55.790
 that we have defined who will be referring to 

00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:57.709
 the person marcus and then nobody 

00:14:55.790 --> 00:14:59.660
 is going to be a price of the case we still have 

00:14:57.709 --> 00:15:04.250
 once defined so we use symbol 

00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:07.370
 people to do to do 

00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:09.850
 reference to the fact that marcus is a 

00:15:07.370 --> 00:15:09.850
 nobody 

00:15:10.970 --> 00:15:14.550
 then from his mark us is a firefighter 

00:15:13.110 --> 00:15:15.929
 the way the logical screen of the 

00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:17.699
 first of all it is to take back our 

00:15:15.929 --> 00:15:19.110
 same constant marcus so we speak 

00:15:17.699 --> 00:15:21.119
 still from the same person who's called 

00:15:19.110 --> 00:15:23.999
 marcus and then give it an argument 

00:15:21.119 --> 00:15:26.639
 a new loan of the body that we are going to write 

00:15:23.999 --> 00:15:30.559
 pompey we want symbols the word pump 

00:15:26.639 --> 00:15:33.269
 and one to make reference to the fact that 

00:15:30.559 --> 00:15:35.389
 something in our our 

00:15:33.269 --> 00:15:39.269
 environment is pumped starts only if 

00:15:35.389 --> 00:15:41.540
 marcus is well and truly pumped according to this 

00:15:39.269 --> 00:15:41.540
 description 

00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:45.989
 all firefighters are romans to a 

00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:49.019
 way of writing at the logis de prades 

00:15:45.989 --> 00:15:52.319
 say that for all x firefighters of x 

00:15:49.019 --> 00:15:53.549
 involves Roman dx 

00:15:52.319 --> 00:15:55.739
 actually if all the pumps and a 

00:15:53.549 --> 00:15:58.350
 its romans that means to be 

00:15:55.739 --> 00:16:00.089
 pumped implies to be Roman and that's 

00:15:58.350 --> 00:16:02.759
 true for all firefighters peace is 

00:16:00.089 --> 00:16:06.329
 so we add it for all to our 

00:16:02.759 --> 00:16:09.360
 implication on x and then we put the 

00:16:06.329 --> 00:16:11.309
 variable x in the arguments of predica 

00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:13.619
 Roman Pompeii their marks and if we have 

00:16:11.309 --> 00:16:15.299
 defined another close to the human body that 

00:16:13.619 --> 00:16:20.490
 refers to the fact that something 

00:16:15.299 --> 00:16:22.589
 be Roman Caesar is a leader 

00:16:20.490 --> 00:16:26.819
 when we add a constant 6 years 

00:16:22.589 --> 00:16:29.160
 then have defined a new a new 

00:16:26.819 --> 00:16:31.049
 symbol for the predicate forgiveness a 

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:32.730
 new club loan with symbol 

00:16:31.049 --> 00:16:34.319
 leaders who is referring to the fact 

00:16:32.730 --> 00:16:35.970
 that something is leaders so 

00:16:34.319 --> 00:16:39.980
 we are saying that caesar the 

00:16:35.970 --> 00:16:39.980
 constant season and leaders 

00:16:40.079 --> 00:16:45.480
 everyone is loyal to someone 

00:16:41.779 --> 00:16:50.369
 so we start by defining a 

00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:53.759
 loyal pass price x / y that says that x and 

00:16:50.369 --> 00:16:56.999
 loyal to it's the definition when we 

00:16:53.759 --> 00:16:58.410
 is on the table here skin our predica 

00:16:56.999 --> 00:17:00.869
 loyal 

00:16:58.410 --> 00:17:04.139
 everyone so for any excess 

00:17:00.869 --> 00:17:08.610
 it's everyone is loyal so x 

00:17:04.139 --> 00:17:11.039
 for all x royal x to someone so he 

00:17:08.610 --> 00:17:13.649
 exists for each person does exist 

00:17:11.039 --> 00:17:16.919
 a person for a person there for 

00:17:13.649 --> 00:17:21.380
 every person x such as x and loyal to y 

00:17:16.919 --> 00:17:21.380
 so such as loyal of xy 

00:17:21.799 --> 00:17:27.809
 all Romans are loyal to six has 

00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:32.789
 rolled a bit more complicated then for 

00:17:27.809 --> 00:17:37.380
 all x we ​​have that Roman x implies either 

00:17:32.789 --> 00:17:40.880
 loyal excisors or to ix Caesar so 

00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:43.049
 indeed we did well 

00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:44.730
 encapsulated in first-order logic the 

00:17:43.049 --> 00:17:48.570
 does that if one is Roman glassey 

00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:52.470
 implies either that x and loyal to Caesar 

00:17:48.570 --> 00:17:55.110
 so loyal and Caesar or x to icesar so 

00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:56.940
 so exciting more dense than if we still 

00:17:55.110 --> 00:18:00.029
 introduced a new cock loan that is 

00:17:56.940 --> 00:18:03.299
 hate that refers to the fact that a 

00:18:00.029 --> 00:18:05.580
 object x more hate another object there dancing 

00:18:03.299 --> 00:18:07.380
 deposit of the variable x then the ski and 

00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:08.850
 alice and caesar so we use the 

00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:11.460
 constant six years to reference 

00:18:08.850 --> 00:18:13.169
 to the fact that Caesar here who hoisted the 

00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:17.610
 same thing as the Caesars here which is 

00:18:13.169 --> 00:18:19.590
 leading the only leaders that a 

00:18:17.610 --> 00:18:24.240
 nobody and that's murder are those 

00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:27.179
 to which she is not loyal then this 

00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:29.159
 that it says if we will read the formula 

00:18:27.179 --> 00:18:31.260
 seems logical to pre-roll for everything and 

00:18:29.159 --> 00:18:34.860
 for everything and greek 

00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:39.570
 if we have nobody x and Greek leaders 

00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:44.700
 and murdered xy no that translates well the 

00:18:39.570 --> 00:18:46.590
 so you leave alone 

00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:49.649
 leaders so that's referring to 

00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:53.010
 leaders that a person has 

00:18:49.649 --> 00:18:56.210
 to murder so we have to the person x who 

00:18:53.010 --> 00:18:59.250
 are trying to murder murdered xy sa 

00:18:56.210 --> 00:18:59.639
 reference to a person to some 

00:18:59.250 --> 00:19:01.919
 thing 

00:18:59.639 --> 00:19:04.110
 an object x that kills Greek then 

00:19:01.919 --> 00:19:06.059
 putting person x make sure that x is 

00:19:04.110 --> 00:19:07.880
 a person and now what is 

00:19:06.059 --> 00:19:11.279
 murdered in what is described here 

00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:14.419
 he's an officer so we're going to have 

00:19:11.279 --> 00:19:17.760
 also here leaders of y 

00:19:14.419 --> 00:19:21.779
 then nobody x and Greek leaders and 

00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:25.799
 murdered xy implies we do not have the 

00:19:21.779 --> 00:19:27.809
 negation of loyal xy and so as one 

00:19:25.799 --> 00:19:30.779
 had in the app too are those 

00:19:27.809 --> 00:19:32.669
 to which she is not loyal so the 

00:19:30.779 --> 00:19:35.279
 person who did 

00:19:32.669 --> 00:19:39.379
 the assassin is not loyal to the 

00:19:35.279 --> 00:19:42.720
 person to there 

00:19:39.379 --> 00:19:44.940
 in fact here we do rather the leader 

00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:50.999
 Greek this is what was specified 

00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:54.720
 in the formula here and finally marcus 

00:19:50.999 --> 00:19:57.869
 tried to murder Caesar well we 

00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:59.539
 had taken it had been defined the predicted that 

00:19:57.869 --> 00:20:01.109
 pretty cynical that refers to 

00:19:59.539 --> 00:20:03.090
 Something 

00:20:01.109 --> 00:20:05.700
 x who is murdering something Greek 

00:20:03.090 --> 00:20:07.499
 when if we have outright that marcus has 

00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:09.419
 tried to murder Caesar will have done 

00:20:07.499 --> 00:20:12.659
 murder that refers to the fact of 

00:20:09.419 --> 00:20:14.460
 six to try to sign so that's 

00:20:12.659 --> 00:20:17.100
 marcus who are trying to murder Caesar 

00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:21.749
 we call Marcus pardon murdered 

00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:24.809
 Marcus Caesar so that's how we 

00:20:21.749 --> 00:20:26.369
 would do that would be a way we could have 

00:20:24.809 --> 00:20:28.619
 choose different symbols for them 

00:20:26.369 --> 00:20:30.480
 different prices of the co in too so they 

00:20:28.619 --> 00:20:32.970
 go to certain variations if it had 

00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:35.609
 been you who made this translation 

00:20:32.970 --> 00:20:37.559
 the from the national language to the 

00:20:35.609 --> 00:20:41.369
 first order logic this is a 

00:20:37.559 --> 00:20:43.619
 reasonable way to translate all 

00:20:41.369 --> 00:20:47.629
 facts here in the form of a base of 

00:20:43.619 --> 00:20:47.629
 first-order logic knowledge
