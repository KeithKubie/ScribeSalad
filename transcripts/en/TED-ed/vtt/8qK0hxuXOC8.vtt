00:00:07.095 --> 00:00:08.584
Most people will take a pill,

00:00:08.584 --> 00:00:09.834
receive an injection,

00:00:09.834 --> 00:00:13.335
or otherwise take some kind of medicine
during their lives,

00:00:13.335 --> 00:00:18.266
but most of us don't know anything
about how these substances actually work.

00:00:18.266 --> 00:00:21.816
How can various compounds impact the way
we physically feel,

00:00:21.816 --> 00:00:22.726
think,

00:00:22.726 --> 00:00:24.844
and even behave?

00:00:24.844 --> 00:00:28.665
For the most part, this depends on
how a drug alters the communication

00:00:28.665 --> 00:00:31.226
between cells in the brain.

00:00:31.226 --> 00:00:33.787
There are a number of different ways
that can happen.

00:00:33.787 --> 00:00:35.866
But before it gets into the brain,

00:00:35.866 --> 00:00:38.124
any drug must first reach the bloodstream

00:00:38.124 --> 00:00:41.897
on a journey that can take anywhere
from seconds to hours,

00:00:41.897 --> 00:00:44.327
depending on factors like how
it's administered.

00:00:44.327 --> 00:00:47.367
The slowest method is to take
a drug orally

00:00:47.367 --> 00:00:50.097
because it must be absorbed by
our digestive system

00:00:50.097 --> 00:00:52.189
before it takes effect.

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:55.398
Inhaling a drug gets it into
the bloodstream faster.

00:00:55.398 --> 00:00:58.888
And injecting a drug intravenously
works quickly too

00:00:58.888 --> 00:01:02.007
because it pumps the chemicals directly
into the blood.

00:01:02.007 --> 00:01:06.788
Once there, the drug quickly reaches
the gates of its destination, the brain.

00:01:06.788 --> 00:01:10.606
The entrance to this organ is guarded
by the blood-brain barrier,

00:01:10.606 --> 00:01:12.858
which separates blood 
from the nervous system

00:01:12.858 --> 00:01:15.940
to keep potentially dangerous 
substances out.

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:19.148
So all drugs must have a specific
chemical composition

00:01:19.148 --> 00:01:23.568
which gives them the key to unlock
this barrier and pass through.

00:01:23.568 --> 00:01:27.428
Once inside, drugs start to interfere
with the brain's normal functioning

00:01:27.428 --> 00:01:30.938
by targeting its web of neurons 
and synapses.

00:01:30.938 --> 00:01:35.498
Neurons are brain cells that have
a nucleus, dendrites, and an axon.

00:01:35.498 --> 00:01:39.540
Synapses are structures placed along
the dendrites or the axon

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.989
which allow the exchange of 
electrochemical signals between neurons.

00:01:43.989 --> 00:01:47.669
Those signals take the form of chemicals
called neurotransmitters.

00:01:47.669 --> 00:01:51.470
Each neurotransmitter plays different
roles in regulating our behaviors,

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:52.280
emotions,

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.489
and cognition.

00:01:53.489 --> 00:01:55.880
But they all work in one of two ways.

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.080
They can either inhibit 
the receiving neuron,

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.601
limiting its activity,

00:01:59.601 --> 00:02:00.980
or excite it,

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:05.079
creating a new electrochemical signal
that spreads throughout the network.

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:08.020
Any leftover neurotransmitter usually
gets degraded

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.120
or reabsorbed 
into the transmitting neuron.

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.981
A drug's effectiveness stems 
from its ability

00:02:13.981 --> 00:02:18.651
to manipulate these synaptic transmissions
at different phases of the process.

00:02:18.651 --> 00:02:21.401
That results in an increase or a decrease

00:02:21.401 --> 00:02:24.752
in the amount of neurotransmitters
being spread.

00:02:24.752 --> 00:02:28.402
For instance, common antidepressants,
like SSRIs,

00:02:28.402 --> 00:02:31.181
stop the reabsorption of serotonin,

00:02:31.181 --> 00:02:34.572
a neurotransmitter that modulates
our moods.

00:02:34.572 --> 00:02:37.744
This effectively pushes more of it
into the neural network.

00:02:37.744 --> 00:02:40.332
Meanwhile, painkillers, like morphine,

00:02:40.332 --> 00:02:43.444
raise levels of serotonin 
and noradrenaline,

00:02:43.444 --> 00:02:44.842
which regulate energy,

00:02:44.842 --> 00:02:45.801
arousal,

00:02:45.801 --> 00:02:46.740
alertness,

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.190
and pleasure.

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.812
Those same neurotransmitters also
affect endorphin receptors,

00:02:51.812 --> 00:02:53.542
reducing pain perception.

00:02:53.542 --> 00:02:57.712
And tranquilizers works by increasing
the production of GABA

00:02:57.712 --> 00:02:59.902
to inhibit neural activity

00:02:59.902 --> 00:03:03.913
putting the person in a relaxed
or sedated state.

00:03:03.913 --> 00:03:06.473
What about illegal or elicit drugs?

00:03:06.473 --> 00:03:10.954
These have powerful impacts on the brain
that we're still trying to understand.

00:03:10.954 --> 00:03:12.884
Crystal meth, an amphetamine,

00:03:12.884 --> 00:03:15.943
induces a long-lasting release
of dopamine,

00:03:15.943 --> 00:03:21.055
a neurotransmitter linked with
the perception of reward and pleasure.

00:03:21.055 --> 00:03:23.593
It also activates noradrenaline receptors,

00:03:23.593 --> 00:03:25.125
which increases the heart rate,

00:03:25.125 --> 00:03:26.368
dilates pupils,

00:03:26.368 --> 00:03:29.632
and triggers the body's fight
or flight response.

00:03:29.632 --> 00:03:33.444
Cocaine blocks the reuptake of dopamine
and serotonin,

00:03:33.444 --> 00:03:35.073
pushing more into the network

00:03:35.073 --> 00:03:36.432
where they boost energy,

00:03:36.432 --> 00:03:38.125
create feelings of euphoria,

00:03:38.125 --> 00:03:40.454
and suppress appetites.

00:03:40.454 --> 00:03:44.159
And hallucinogenic drugs have some
of the most puzzling effects.

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:45.659
Substances like LSD,

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:46.638
mescaline,

00:03:46.638 --> 00:03:47.757
and DMT

00:03:47.757 --> 00:03:50.225
all block the release of serotonin,

00:03:50.225 --> 00:03:52.895
which regulates mood and impulsivity.

00:03:52.895 --> 00:03:55.246
They also have an impact 
on the neural circuits

00:03:55.246 --> 00:03:59.815
involved in perception, learning,
and behavioral regulation,

00:03:59.815 --> 00:04:04.348
which may explain why these drugs
have such powerful impacts.

00:04:04.348 --> 00:04:06.594
Even if some of these 
effects sound exciting,

00:04:06.594 --> 00:04:10.944
there are reasons why some of these drugs
are highly controlled and often illegal.

00:04:10.944 --> 00:04:13.468
Drugs have the power to alter 
the brain's chemistry,

00:04:13.468 --> 00:04:17.315
and repeated use can permanently
rewire the neural networks

00:04:17.315 --> 00:04:19.107
that support our ability to think,

00:04:19.107 --> 00:04:20.255
make decisions,

00:04:20.255 --> 00:04:21.000
learn,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.757
and remember things.

00:04:22.757 --> 00:04:25.996
There's a lot we still don't know 
about drugs and their effects,

00:04:25.996 --> 00:04:27.911
both the good and the bad.

00:04:27.911 --> 00:04:31.647
But those we do know about are the ones
we've studied closely,

00:04:31.647 --> 00:04:33.978
and turned into effective medicines.

00:04:33.978 --> 00:04:36.958
As our knowledge grows about drugs
and the brain,

00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:39.308
the possibilities will also increase

00:04:39.308 --> 00:04:43.287
for treating the many medical problems
that puzzle researchers today.
