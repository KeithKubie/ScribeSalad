00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:08.180
Science, it gets in your head man, it gets
in your head and it ... changes things.

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:13.690
Hello DNews fans, Happy Anniversary Weekend!

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:16.090
Your friendly neighborhood neuroscientist
Crystal here.

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:20.099
I’ve hosted so many videos here for you
guys that I couldn’t even remember my first

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:24.800
one, but I’m told it was about memory and
optogenetics, which is not surprising because

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.960
they are two of my favorite things!

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.260
Optogenetics is the field of study where we
use genes that regulate a cell’s responses

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.840
to light to help us control events in a biological
system.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.220
This gives researchers the ability to literally
control the minds of laboratory animals.

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:42.210
Turning brain regions on and off allow us
to isolate the function of these regions and

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.330
better understand how they drive specific
behaviors.

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:49.000
The technique has been used to study all kinds
of phenomena including hunger, fear, and even

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.000
social behaviors.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.941
And as we saw in the paper Trace and I discussed
in that first video two years ago, optogenetics

00:00:54.941 --> 00:00:58.450
can even be used to manipulate the memories
stored in our brain.

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:00.980
Which is a good thing if we’re beginning
to forget …

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:05.460
Alzheimer’s disease is a common cause of
brain degeneration, and it typically begins

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.810
with loss of memory and other impairments
in cognitive function.

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.259
Until recently, it was difficult for scientists
to discriminate between impairments in how

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:17.490
memories are stored and the inability for
Alzheimer’s patients to retrieve their stored

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.490
memories, so scientists at RIKEN and MIT went
about using optogenetics to find out.

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:27.499
In a paper published in 2016, researchers
took mice that had been genetically modified

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:32.759
to have an Alzheimer's-like condition and
to be responsive to optogenetic manipulation,

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.369
and taught them to be afraid of something.

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:36.770
Then, they split them into two groups.

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.880
One group did not receive optogenetic treatment
and the other one did.

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.710
Then both groups of mice were re-exposed to
what what they were taught to be afraid of.

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.959
The untreated group forgot they were supposed
to be afraid, but the other group didn't!

00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:51.850
The differences in memory retention were the
result of changes in special memory cells

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:53.710
in the hippocampus region of the brain.

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.749
These particular cells have spiky bumps on
them, located on a part of the cell called

00:01:57.749 --> 00:01:58.749
the dendrite.

00:01:58.749 --> 00:02:02.479
The spiky bumps make up what is called the
“dendritic spine” -- think of it like

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:05.469
the spine in your back, which has bumps from
the vertebrae.

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:08.450
These are crucial to our brain’s ability
to adapt and learn.

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.580
When these spikes go away like they do in
Alzheimer’s disease, so do the memories

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.120
in the cells that express them.

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.970
Optogenetic treatment can prevent or reduce
this loss.

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.420
In this study, scientists used a fiber optic
cable to stimulate the memory cells with blue

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:23.420
light.

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.950
Now remember, the mice they were using had
been genetically modified to have optically

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.080
responsive neurons.

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.520
This kind of treatment wouldn’t work with
any old mouse you found on the street.

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.720
We know that the treatment worked because
the memory cells of the mice maintained spinal

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.990
density, and the mice retained their memory
of fear!

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:43.100
This indicates that this type of treatment
could, one day, be an effective strategy for

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.960
treating memory loss in the early stages of
Alzheimer’s disease.

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:51.280
Because optogenetics requires genetic modifications
in the cells, the technique can currently

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.040
only being applied to animals in the laboratory,
but with the rapid advancement of genome editing

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.980
by CRISPR/Cas9 and new advancements in getting
these genetic modifications into the brain,

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.250
this science might be inside your head before
you know it.

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.930
The results of scientific investigation made
possible by optogenetics have widespread implications

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:11.060
for the treatment of many human conditions.

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.580
Two years ago, we were discussing possible
therapy for PTSD, this year it’s Alzheimer's

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:16.580
Disease.

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:19.550
It will be exciting to see what progress we
can make toward understanding memory and how

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:21.850
to manipulate it in the next two years.

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:24.880
But for now, if you’re like me and can’t
remember that first video.

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.180
Here’s an opportunity to remember.

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.000
What’s your favorite memory?
