00:00:00.371 --> 00:00:02.927
- [Voiceover] When we study
science it's natural to

00:00:02.927 --> 00:00:05.245
just categorize a whole
series of things as just

00:00:05.245 --> 00:00:07.902
being really really unimaginably small.

00:00:07.902 --> 00:00:10.219
So when people say, hey atomic scale,

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:11.571
or molecular scale,

00:00:11.571 --> 00:00:13.780
or protein, or cell,

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:15.567
you often just group that together and say

00:00:15.567 --> 00:00:16.771
oh, those are really really really

00:00:16.771 --> 00:00:18.392
really small things.

00:00:18.392 --> 00:00:19.969
But what I want to do in this video

00:00:19.969 --> 00:00:21.695
is get an appreciation that even though

00:00:21.695 --> 00:00:23.951
all the things I've just
mentioned are really small,

00:00:23.951 --> 00:00:25.652
there's actually a huge difference

00:00:25.652 --> 00:00:27.387
in the sizes of those things.

00:00:27.387 --> 00:00:29.278
And hopefully that'll
give us an appreciation

00:00:29.278 --> 00:00:33.283
for how complex something
like a cell can be.

00:00:33.283 --> 00:00:35.141
How it can have all of this machinery.

00:00:35.141 --> 00:00:38.290
How it can actually be a living organism

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:40.726
or part of a living organism.

00:00:40.726 --> 00:00:42.941
And so at this scale this is a

00:00:42.941 --> 00:00:44.416
this is my little rendering,

00:00:44.416 --> 00:00:46.032
my drawing of a water molecule.

00:00:46.032 --> 00:00:48.558
You have the oxygen atom
in the right over here

00:00:48.558 --> 00:00:49.558
in this purplish color,

00:00:49.558 --> 00:00:51.575
and then you have two hydrogen molecules

00:00:51.575 --> 00:00:52.639
bonded to it.

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:54.375
And this is going to be roughly

00:00:54.375 --> 00:00:55.792
0.275 nanometers.

00:00:57.841 --> 00:00:59.240
And just to remind ourselves,

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.556
a nanometer is a billionth

00:01:01.556 --> 00:01:02.623
of a meter.

00:01:02.623 --> 00:01:04.754
And just to get an appreciation of that

00:01:04.754 --> 00:01:05.750
so let me.

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:06.960
So this is

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.300
one billionth

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:09.383
one billionth

00:01:11.055 --> 00:01:12.555
one billionth of a

00:01:14.752 --> 00:01:16.267
one billionth of a meter.

00:01:16.267 --> 00:01:17.470
That's a nanometer.

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:18.805
And if you want to even attempt

00:01:18.805 --> 00:01:20.077
to visualize that

00:01:20.077 --> 00:01:22.211
that would be a millionth

00:01:22.211 --> 00:01:23.920
of a millimeter.

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.458
So one, let me write this.

00:01:26.458 --> 00:01:27.875
One one millionth

00:01:29.404 --> 00:01:31.290
one millionth

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.623
of a millimeter.

00:01:34.124 --> 00:01:35.771
And I actually like using this one

00:01:35.771 --> 00:01:37.770
because a millimeter is

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.687
about as small as I can

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.366
on a reasonable basis visualize.

00:01:43.366 --> 00:01:45.197
But instead of a millionth of that

00:01:45.197 --> 00:01:48.549
it goes well beyond, at
least my capabilities

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:49.932
of visualization.

00:01:49.932 --> 00:01:51.677
So that would be the diameter

00:01:51.677 --> 00:01:54.697
or the width of a water molecule.

00:01:54.697 --> 00:01:56.191
But now let's go to the next scale up.

00:01:56.191 --> 00:01:57.847
We've talked a lot about proteins

00:01:57.847 --> 00:01:58.795
and this is our friend,

00:01:58.795 --> 00:02:00.727
this is right over here is

00:02:00.727 --> 00:02:03.130
our friend hemoglobin.

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:04.652
And this gives you a sense of scale,

00:02:04.652 --> 00:02:06.590
the width of hemoglobin is going to be

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.795
about five nanometers.

00:02:08.795 --> 00:02:11.295
Or five billionths of a meter.

00:02:12.249 --> 00:02:13.924
Now that seems super small,

00:02:13.924 --> 00:02:15.850
so in some ways it's okay to categorize

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.181
that into your super
small part of the brain.

00:02:18.181 --> 00:02:19.108
But it's good to appreciate,

00:02:19.108 --> 00:02:21.462
this is much larger than a water molecule.

00:02:21.462 --> 00:02:23.693
If a water molecule were on this scale

00:02:23.693 --> 00:02:24.948
I predrew it, this little thing

00:02:24.948 --> 00:02:26.917
over here, that's my attempt

00:02:26.917 --> 00:02:28.876
at drawing a water molecule

00:02:28.876 --> 00:02:30.148
at this same scale.

00:02:30.148 --> 00:02:31.866
So even when you go from something

00:02:31.866 --> 00:02:34.094
like a water molecule to a protein

00:02:34.094 --> 00:02:36.576
you're already going
dramatically up in size

00:02:36.576 --> 00:02:38.180
and dramatically up in complexity.

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:39.774
And we've talked a lot
about protein structure

00:02:39.774 --> 00:02:40.921
and how they can take on all of these

00:02:40.921 --> 00:02:42.889
interesting shapes, and do fairly

00:02:42.889 --> 00:02:44.976
surprising and complex things

00:02:44.976 --> 00:02:47.393
inside of biological systems.

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:49.658
But now let's go,

00:02:49.658 --> 00:02:52.308
let's go the next scale up.

00:02:52.308 --> 00:02:53.513
And the next scale up

00:02:53.513 --> 00:02:55.327
I'm gonna go to a virus.

00:02:55.327 --> 00:02:57.056
And what I've attempted to draw here

00:02:57.056 --> 00:02:59.692
this is a fairly well known virus,

00:02:59.692 --> 00:03:01.456
this is HIV.

00:03:01.456 --> 00:03:03.241
And it's actually one
of the larger viruses

00:03:03.241 --> 00:03:04.645
and its diameter is roughly

00:03:04.645 --> 00:03:05.478
120,

00:03:06.766 --> 00:03:08.016
120 nanometers.

00:03:08.995 --> 00:03:10.536
So if we were to

00:03:10.536 --> 00:03:12.314
draw this hemoglobin

00:03:12.314 --> 00:03:14.500
this hemoglobin protein at the same scale

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:15.834
as we've drawn this virus

00:03:15.834 --> 00:03:17.081
this thing right over here

00:03:17.081 --> 00:03:18.767
would be the hemoglobin protein.

00:03:18.767 --> 00:03:19.883
And we wouldn't even be able to see

00:03:19.883 --> 00:03:21.698
the water molecule at this scale

00:03:21.698 --> 00:03:23.322
right over here.

00:03:23.322 --> 00:03:25.530
But this is still really really small.

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.937
This is 120 billionths

00:03:27.937 --> 00:03:29.470
of a meter.

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.201
So this is still

00:03:31.201 --> 00:03:33.951
this is still unimaginably small.

00:03:34.877 --> 00:03:36.094
But now let's go up to the,

00:03:36.094 --> 00:03:37.648
let's go up to the next scale.

00:03:37.648 --> 00:03:39.330
So this creepy picture

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:40.547
right over here,

00:03:40.547 --> 00:03:41.958
this is a T-cell.

00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:43.583
This is a depiction

00:03:43.583 --> 00:03:44.745
this is a, if you want to see

00:03:44.745 --> 00:03:45.666
the whole thing,

00:03:45.666 --> 00:03:48.220
that is a T-cell right over here.

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:49.581
This is a T-cell.

00:03:49.581 --> 00:03:50.584
And this creepy picture,

00:03:50.584 --> 00:03:51.753
this all the blue,

00:03:51.753 --> 00:03:53.048
that's the T-cell.

00:03:53.048 --> 00:03:54.396
And what you see in yellow

00:03:54.396 --> 00:03:56.896
that's the HIV virus emerging,

00:03:57.952 --> 00:04:00.465
taking advantage of this T-cell.

00:04:00.465 --> 00:04:02.456
So, that's why it's so creepy,

00:04:02.456 --> 00:04:04.663
it's using that cell's machinery

00:04:04.663 --> 00:04:06.511
to reproduce itself.

00:04:06.511 --> 00:04:08.313
But you immediately see on this picture

00:04:08.313 --> 00:04:10.713
how small the HIV virus is

00:04:10.713 --> 00:04:13.657
compared to the actual T-cell.

00:04:13.657 --> 00:04:16.881
Each of these small little things

00:04:16.881 --> 00:04:18.700
each of these small things,

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.162
is an HIV virus, which we already saw

00:04:21.162 --> 00:04:23.612
is a lot bigger than something like

00:04:23.612 --> 00:04:25.604
a hemoglobin protein.

00:04:25.604 --> 00:04:26.800
And so a hemoglobin protein

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:27.779
you wouldn't even be able to

00:04:27.779 --> 00:04:29.546
on this scale, maybe

00:04:29.546 --> 00:04:30.547
it would be a pixel,

00:04:30.547 --> 00:04:31.380
if that.

00:04:32.585 --> 00:04:34.846
And on a similar scale, is this T-cell,

00:04:34.846 --> 00:04:37.623
you have a, you have things
like red blood cells.

00:04:37.623 --> 00:04:39.450
This is actually a comparison

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:40.283
this side by side.

00:04:40.283 --> 00:04:41.687
This is using an electron,

00:04:41.687 --> 00:04:43.322
this is using an electron microscope

00:04:43.322 --> 00:04:45.064
you see a red blood cell right over here

00:04:45.064 --> 00:04:45.897
and you see a T-cell

00:04:45.897 --> 00:04:47.243
and they're roughly roughly

00:04:47.243 --> 00:04:48.660
on the same size,

00:04:49.701 --> 00:04:52.003
or at least the same
order of magnitude size.

00:04:52.003 --> 00:04:53.482
And a red blood cell is going to be

00:04:53.482 --> 00:04:55.565
six to eight micrometers,

00:04:56.535 --> 00:04:58.017
micrometers wide.

00:04:58.017 --> 00:04:59.835
So this is six to eight millionths

00:04:59.835 --> 00:05:00.668
of a meter.

00:05:00.668 --> 00:05:01.526
So if we were to

00:05:01.526 --> 00:05:03.126
if we were to just take seven

00:05:03.126 --> 00:05:04.199
as the average.

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:06.019
Seven millionths,

00:05:06.019 --> 00:05:06.852
seven

00:05:07.847 --> 00:05:09.802
seven millionths

00:05:09.802 --> 00:05:10.853
of a meter.

00:05:10.853 --> 00:05:11.686
Over here, we're talking about

00:05:11.686 --> 00:05:14.061
a millionth of a millimeter.

00:05:14.061 --> 00:05:16.236
Now we're talking about seven millionths

00:05:16.236 --> 00:05:17.917
of a meter.

00:05:17.917 --> 00:05:19.758
And just to get an appreciation for size,

00:05:19.758 --> 00:05:21.495
we already compared the virus,

00:05:21.495 --> 00:05:23.369
the HIV virus, to this cell.

00:05:23.369 --> 00:05:24.525
We're seeing it directly

00:05:24.525 --> 00:05:26.692
as a emerge from the cell.

00:05:27.872 --> 00:05:30.240
But each of these red blood cells

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.159
are gonna contain roughly

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:34.909
280 million hemoglobin molecules.

00:05:36.688 --> 00:05:39.364
So there's gonna be 200

00:05:39.364 --> 00:05:40.477
each of these there's gonna be

00:05:40.477 --> 00:05:42.806
280 million of these.

00:05:42.806 --> 00:05:44.056
So 280 million,

00:05:45.876 --> 00:05:47.861
that's a million

00:05:47.861 --> 00:05:49.470
million hemoglobins

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:50.920
in each one of these.

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:52.195
So hopefully this starts to give you

00:05:52.195 --> 00:05:53.710
an appreciation for

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:55.588
even though we categorize cells

00:05:55.588 --> 00:05:57.652
as these unimaginably small things,

00:05:57.652 --> 00:05:59.404
they're actually far larger

00:05:59.404 --> 00:06:03.000
they're ginormous compared to things

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.533
even like even like large even proteins.

00:06:06.533 --> 00:06:07.902
And especially when you think of things

00:06:07.902 --> 00:06:09.901
on the molecular, or the atomic scale.

00:06:09.901 --> 00:06:11.284
And that's why cells are so interesting.

00:06:11.284 --> 00:06:13.210
They actually have a lot of

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:14.771
complexity to them.

00:06:14.771 --> 00:06:16.770
But just to have an appreciation also

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:19.053
for how small cells are

00:06:19.053 --> 00:06:20.434
even though we've just described

00:06:20.434 --> 00:06:22.253
these red blood cells and these T-cells

00:06:22.253 --> 00:06:25.753
there's these kind of
worlds unto themselves.

00:06:25.753 --> 00:06:28.083
They are these incredibly complex things.

00:06:28.083 --> 00:06:30.549
If I were to draw the width

00:06:30.549 --> 00:06:31.855
of a human hair

00:06:31.855 --> 00:06:33.350
on this screen right now

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:34.269
relative to the scale

00:06:34.269 --> 00:06:35.515
of these red blood cells,

00:06:35.515 --> 00:06:37.774
it would be about as wide as this video.

00:06:37.774 --> 00:06:39.787
So from if I were to draw a human hair

00:06:39.787 --> 00:06:41.416
it would go from there roughly to there

00:06:41.416 --> 00:06:42.605
and there's actually a lot of variance

00:06:42.605 --> 00:06:44.286
in the width of a human hair.

00:06:44.286 --> 00:06:45.739
But the width of a human hair would be

00:06:45.739 --> 00:06:47.229
just about like that.

00:06:47.229 --> 00:06:48.956
If you looked at the scale of

00:06:48.956 --> 00:06:50.473
if you looked at the scale of

00:06:50.473 --> 00:06:51.586
this picture right over here.

00:06:51.586 --> 00:06:52.652
If you looked at these scales

00:06:52.652 --> 00:06:55.050
it would be much much much bigger.

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:56.062
And I encourage you

00:06:56.062 --> 00:06:56.938
we can think, oh okay,

00:06:56.938 --> 00:06:58.074
the width of a human hair.

00:06:58.074 --> 00:06:58.976
Pluck a hair out.

00:06:58.976 --> 00:06:59.809
Look at it.

00:06:59.809 --> 00:07:00.642
Put it on a piece of paper.

00:07:00.642 --> 00:07:02.727
It's hard to even discern the width.

00:07:02.727 --> 00:07:03.758
But we're saying that that width

00:07:03.758 --> 00:07:06.196
compared to these red blood cells

00:07:06.196 --> 00:07:07.576
would actually be your entire

00:07:07.576 --> 00:07:08.502
width of the screen.

00:07:08.502 --> 00:07:09.752
We've already said these red blood cells

00:07:09.752 --> 00:07:11.044
these T-cells, these are kind of

00:07:11.044 --> 00:07:13.720
these are worlds unto
themselves when you think of it

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:17.803
from a viral, or especially
at a molecular scale.
