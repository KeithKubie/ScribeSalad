00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:05.540
- Bladesmiths, welcome to our
strength test, the bolt baton.

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:09.170
Now what I'm going to do
is take this well-used bat,

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:10.880
and I'm going to take
your friction folders.

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.880
And I'm going to baton
the back of your blades

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:16.790
at three different
points on those bolts.

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:18.330
Derek, you're up first.
You ready?

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.920
Uh, yeah, I guess.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.420
Do what you do.

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:24.080
[music playing]

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.210
DEREK: J looks like an
evil villain ready to do

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:30.000
some serious destruction.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.750
Come on, baby.

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:32.750
Hold together.

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:34.580
[music playing]

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:37.500
[shouts]

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:42.210
- [laughing]
- It didn't fly apart.

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.080
That's hard to watch.

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:45.880
[music playing]

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.000
All right, Derek,
first of all,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.580
you did have a little
bit of edge damage here.

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:50.750
You got a couple
rolls here where I

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.420
can actually catch my nail on.

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.420
You do still have
tension, but the problem

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.920
is your blade did shift.

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.580
DEREK: OK.

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:02.330
And when I go to close it,
now it's catching on this side.

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:05.880
But your edge held
up fairly well.

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:06.880
Overall, good job.

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.080
Thank you.

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:09.460
Bob, you ready to play?

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:10.580
It's what I came for.

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:12.290
J: All right, let's do it.

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.580
[music playing]

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.250
BOB: My edge profile might
be just a little bit thin

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:19.960
for this test.

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.540
So I'm nervous as a long-tailed
cat in a room full of rockers.

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.880
You got this.

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:26.790
We'll see.

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.620
[music playing]

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:40.960
All right, Bob.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.920
The big issue was--

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.420
Oh.

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.170
--there is no mechanical
connection back here.

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:49.830
There's no pins.

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.670
When I struck the spine, the
shock traveling down that blade

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.920
just blew that epoxy apart.

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.670
All right, John,
how you feeling?

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.460
Oh, just ready to
get it over with.

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.830
[music playing]

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.500
Mine has got to be the
thinnest blade there.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:11.420
It's not meant to have this
type of abuse put on it.

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.250
[music playing]

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.000
Little blood this time.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.540
All right, John, we've
got a few issues here.

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.290
You don't have
rolls on your edge.

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.620
You have pieces missing.

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.830
And though I like the
fact you used a steel pin,

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.790
it's very small
and it didn't hold,

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.380
just blew right out of place.

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.540
So now your blade just--

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.170
your pivot point
just didn't hold up.

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.880
[music playing]

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.500
To see and test the
edge of your folders,

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.790
I'm going to take your weapon
and slice across this ham.

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.120
Derek, you're up first.
You ready?

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.330
Yes, sir.
[music playing]

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:13.710
Let's talk about the edge.

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:14.880
It's razor sharp.

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.250
All right.

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:17.880
The way I was able to
cut through this ham,

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.210
it sliced easily and deep.

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:21.920
Your blade will cut.

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.000
All right.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.580
All right, Bob,
it's your turn.

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:24.670
You ready?

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:25.540
If you're ready, I'm willing.

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.330
[music playing]

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:37.750
Very nice.

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.250
DOUG: All right, Bob.

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.880
We have an issue with your
handle here being loose.

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.540
But the good thing
about friction folders

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.540
is it is the hand that holds
it in place with the handle,

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.460
secure enough to where I'm
still able to test with it.

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:51.540
I like the way it
feels in the hand.

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.420
Your edge is sharp.

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:54.620
It slices easy.

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:58.620
It's light and fast,
and it will cut.

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:59.380
Thank you.

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:00.420
Good job.

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:01.540
All right, John, it's your turn.

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:03.040
You ready?
- Let's do it.

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.620
[music playing]

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:14.120
Nice.
Way to go.

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.790
Thank you.

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:18.210
Despite having chips on the
edge here, as you can see,

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:20.790
it cuts easily into the ham.

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:22.880
It's just this part
where you can't keep it

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:24.380
close without holding on to it.

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.460
It's lost its
friction in that part.

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:28.380
It will cut.

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:29.080
Thank you, sir.

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:30.750
Good job.

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:32.960
HOST: Bladesmiths, the judges'
deliberation is complete,

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.000
and it's time for one of you
smiths to leave the forge.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.080
The bladesmith
leaving the forge is--

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:39.750
[music playing]

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:43.290
John, your blade did
not make the cut.

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:45.580
J. Neilson's going
to tell you why.

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:47.120
J: Now John, I
liked your concept,

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.170
but that small pin being
unsecured and popping loose,

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:51.920
it's no longer a
friction folder.

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:54.000
And because of that, you failed
to fulfill the requirements

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.290
of the challenge.

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:57.580
And that's why we're
sending you home.

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:00.580
Understood.
