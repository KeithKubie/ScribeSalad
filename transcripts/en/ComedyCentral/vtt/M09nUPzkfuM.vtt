Uh-oh.

Oh.

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:09.809
Hi.

00:00:09.842 --> 00:00:11.511 align:start size:56% position:44%
Oh, hello, Kate.

00:00:11.544 --> 00:00:12.712 size:84% position:42%
I love the smell of manure.

00:00:12.745 --> 00:00:15.515
It reminds me of my childhood.

00:00:15.548 --> 00:00:17.316 align:start size:88% position:13%
Is that poop?

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:20.887 align:start size:44% position:56%
Oh, yeah.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:25.191
Paint the best picture of
a horse whilst riding a horse.

00:00:25.224 --> 00:00:27.827
You may only paint when
your horse is in motion.

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:29.996
So, wait a minute.

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.732
That means I have
to ride a horse?

00:00:32.765 --> 00:00:34.167 align:start size:75% position:25%
Yeah.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.501 align:start size:78% position:22%
How is your horse riding?

00:00:35.534 --> 00:00:37.036 align:start size:91% position:9%
It's not good.

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:39.772 line:85%
Happy getting you on a horse?

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:39.772 align:start position:0%
Uh... Yeah, why not?

00:00:39.805 --> 00:00:41.441
Am I going to be strapped in?

00:00:41.474 --> 00:00:42.542 align:start size:38% position:63% line:85%
Strapped in?

00:00:41.474 --> 00:00:42.542 align:start position:0%
Yeah.

00:00:42.575 --> 00:00:44.077 align:start size:53% position:47% line:85%
I don't think so.

00:00:42.575 --> 00:00:44.077 align:start position:0%
No.

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:45.845 align:start size:88% position:13%
Let's do it.

00:00:45.878 --> 00:00:47.780 align:start size:97% position:3% line:85%
Let's ride a horse.

00:00:45.878 --> 00:00:47.780 align:start size:31% position:69%
Good luck.

00:00:47.813 --> 00:00:49.248 align:start size:78% position:22%
Thanks.

Now we're going to see
everyone except

00:00:53.886 --> 00:00:55.555
for Freddie paint on a horse.

00:00:55.588 --> 00:00:56.856 align:start position:0%
Oh, that's excellent.

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:59.125
Alex, how do you
make the color brown?

00:00:59.158 --> 00:01:00.526 size:88% position:56%
I'd probably just use brown.

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:01.961
Yeah, well you didn't
give me brown.

00:01:01.994 --> 00:01:03.463 size:88% position:56%
You're painting Ebony there.

00:01:03.496 --> 00:01:06.365
Ebony? Beautiful name
for a beautiful horse.

00:01:06.398 --> 00:01:10.036 align:start size:81% position:19%
Are you enjoying yourself?

00:01:10.069 --> 00:01:12.371
Oh, are we running a little?
Oh, my God.

00:01:12.404 --> 00:01:14.907
Okay, there we go.

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.543
Well, I've lost Ebony.

00:01:17.576 --> 00:01:19.112
There we go,
that's a horse face.

00:01:19.145 --> 00:01:20.880 size:63% position:69%
You're not looking
at the model.

00:01:20.913 --> 00:01:24.117
Oh, yeah, I forgot.
My bad.

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.985
Yah.

00:01:26.018 --> 00:01:27.086
We're going to run?

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.455
Okay, okay, whoa, what, what?

00:01:29.488 --> 00:01:30.490 align:start size:81% position:19%
How's your painting going?

00:01:30.523 --> 00:01:32.592
Huh? It's good.

00:01:32.625 --> 00:01:36.996
I think I got a lot
of paint on me.

00:01:37.029 --> 00:01:40.733
I forgot what the challenge is.

00:01:40.766 --> 00:01:43.436
Ow, ooh, oh, ah, oh.
I just peed.

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:45.905
[ Laughter ]

00:01:45.938 --> 00:01:48.508
You guys know it's not easy
to paint on a horse?

00:01:48.541 --> 00:01:52.078
I'm never having children, now.

00:01:52.111 --> 00:01:54.247
I mean, I'm a natural.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:55.481
That looks like a horse.

00:01:55.514 --> 00:01:56.516 align:start size:88% position:13%
A green one.

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.085
It's abstract, you douchebag.

00:01:59.118 --> 00:02:02.855
[ Laughter, cheering, applause ]

00:02:02.888 --> 00:02:06.259 align:end position:100%
What is a douchebag?
We don't have them.

00:02:06.292 --> 00:02:07.493 align:start size:59% position:41%
Is it a good thing?

00:02:07.526 --> 00:02:09.362 size:88% position:44%
Not in that context because,
as you know,

00:02:09.395 --> 00:02:10.930 align:start position:0%
I freaking hate you.

00:02:10.963 --> 00:02:13.633 align:start size:38% position:63%
Yes.

00:02:13.666 --> 00:02:15.034 size:88% position:56%
Before you see the pictures,
I should tell you

00:02:15.067 --> 00:02:17.003 align:start size:78% position:22%
that Ron spent four times

00:02:17.036 --> 00:02:18.337 size:63% position:69%
as long on the horse
as anyone else.

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:19.939 align:start size:75% position:25%
Wow.

00:02:19.972 --> 00:02:20.973
I mean, if you're going to
give me a free horse ride

00:02:21.006 --> 00:02:23.643
I'm going to take advantage.

00:02:23.676 --> 00:02:25.311
Okay, so strap yourselves in.

00:02:25.344 --> 00:02:27.480 align:start size:81% position:19%
These are the four horses.

00:02:29.415 --> 00:02:31.117
I think Dillon did
an interesting job

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.819
because it's kind of like
a Transformers robot.

00:02:33.852 --> 00:02:35.354 align:start position:0% line:85%
Yeah.

00:02:33.852 --> 00:02:35.354
Dinosaur?

00:02:35.387 --> 00:02:37.823 align:start size:59% position:41%
Do you want to look
at Ron's close up?

00:02:37.856 --> 00:02:39.225 align:start size:84% position:16%
Beautiful.

00:02:39.258 --> 00:02:41.360
Yeah, so what I notice
immediately,

00:02:41.393 --> 00:02:43.896
it's like you've just ordered
a hamburger in your wrapper,

00:02:43.929 --> 00:02:45.831
and you look down,
and you're like,

00:02:45.864 --> 00:02:49.135
"Oh, it kind of looks like some
kind of a animal of some sort."

00:02:49.168 --> 00:02:52.138
You get what I was going for.

00:02:52.171 --> 00:02:53.506
It's very good and very...

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:55.474 size:84% position:42%
Yeah, you can stop talking.

00:02:55.507 --> 00:02:58.244
It's a...

00:02:58.277 --> 00:03:01.548
Kate's looks a bit like a horse,
which is good because it's Kate.

00:03:03.782 --> 00:03:06.752
Yeah. What I like about Kate's
is that some of the paint

00:03:06.785 --> 00:03:08.554
is running off of the page,

00:03:08.587 --> 00:03:11.324
which indicates that it's
bleeding in to our own reality,

00:03:11.357 --> 00:03:12.758
which is interesting.

00:03:12.791 --> 00:03:14.327 align:start size:78% position:22%
There's one picture left.

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.697 align:end position:100%
There's the weeping horse
of Lisa Lampanelli.

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.499
I like that her and horse
has the same dye job.

00:03:20.532 --> 00:03:22.768
Yes, yes, yes.
