00:00:00.128 --> 00:00:01.405
 Here we have a square, 

00:00:01.405 --> 00:00:03.481
 on which all sides are x long. 

00:00:03.481 --> 00:00:04.688
 Here I want to think about it 

00:00:04.688 --> 00:00:06.635
 whether the perimeter of the square 

00:00:06.635 --> 00:00:10.627
 is directly proportional to the length of the square. 

00:00:10.627 --> 00:00:12.202
 Let's think a little. 

00:00:12.202 --> 00:00:13.887
 I'll draw a table, 

00:00:13.887 --> 00:00:17.101
 I'll make a few columns. 

00:00:17.101 --> 00:00:20.444
 Here she is, 

00:00:20.444 --> 00:00:22.343
 I will make three columns, 

00:00:22.343 --> 00:00:24.101
 as in the first 

00:00:24.101 --> 00:00:26.887
 we will look 

00:00:26.887 --> 00:00:30.376
 the length of the country. 

00:00:30.376 --> 00:00:32.116
 It is measured as x. 

00:00:32.116 --> 00:00:36.211
 In the next column we'll look at the tour. 

00:00:36.211 --> 00:00:37.177
 How is this? 

00:00:37.177 --> 00:00:39.696
 This will be x plus x, plus x, plus x, 

00:00:39.696 --> 00:00:41.472
 which of course is 4x. 

00:00:41.472 --> 00:00:43.352
 Then I want to look at the attitude. 

00:00:43.352 --> 00:00:48.550
 The relationship between the perimeter 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.273
 and the length of the country. 

00:00:56.173 --> 00:00:59.867
 What is the tour, 

00:00:59.867 --> 00:01:00.865
 when the length of the country is equal to 1? 

00:01:00.865 --> 00:01:02.118
 It will be 4 by 1. 

00:01:02.118 --> 00:01:03.836
 1 plus 1, plus 1, plus 1. 

00:01:03.836 --> 00:01:05.120
 It will be 4. 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.207
 And what is the attitude? 

00:01:06.207 --> 00:01:07.564
 It will be 4 to 1, 

00:01:07.564 --> 00:01:09.599
 which of course equals 4. 

00:01:09.599 --> 00:01:11.566
 But what if the length of the country is 2? 

00:01:11.566 --> 00:01:12.807
 Then the tour will be 

00:01:12.807 --> 00:01:13.985
 2 plus 2, plus 2, plus 2. 

00:01:13.985 --> 00:01:15.726
 The tour will be 4 by 2. 

00:01:15.726 --> 00:01:17.176
 So 8. 

00:01:17.176 --> 00:01:19.649
 Therefore, the ratio will be 8 to 2, 

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:21.367
 which will be equal to 4. 

00:01:21.367 --> 00:01:23.168
 I think we found some kind of dependence here. 

00:01:23.168 --> 00:01:24.688
 It seems that the attitude of the tour to 

00:01:24.688 --> 00:01:27.556
 the length of the country will always be 4. 

00:01:27.556 --> 00:01:28.810
 We can go on here. 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.368
 If the length of the country is 3, 

00:01:31.368 --> 00:01:33.069
 then the tour will be 12. 

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:34.207
 What is the attitude? 

00:01:34.207 --> 00:01:36.934
 12 divided by 3 equals 4. 

00:01:36.934 --> 00:01:39.092
 This is not a magical trick, 

00:01:39.092 --> 00:01:40.047
 because to find the tour, 

00:01:40.047 --> 00:01:41.984
 we multiply by 4. 

00:01:41.984 --> 00:01:44.143
 The relationship of the circumference to the length of the country 

00:01:44.143 --> 00:01:46.785
 always 

00:01:46.785 --> 00:01:48.280
 will be 4x, 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:49.688
 if the length of the side is x, 

00:01:49.688 --> 00:01:51.243
 and 4x divided by x, 

00:01:51.243 --> 00:01:53.805
 it will always be 4. 

00:01:53.805 --> 00:01:55.972
 Well, that's what our condition is 

00:01:55.972 --> 00:01:58.001
 to have a straightforward relationship. 

00:01:58.001 --> 00:02:00.419
 The relationship between the circumference and the length of the country 

00:02:00.419 --> 00:02:02.137
 it will always be 4. 

00:02:02.137 --> 00:02:04.157
 There was no need to make this table here, 

00:02:04.157 --> 00:02:06.084
 but it makes the task a bit more specific. 

00:02:06.084 --> 00:02:08.242
 Or we can write it in the following way: 

00:02:08.242 --> 00:02:09.538
 we can write that 

00:02:09.538 --> 00:02:14.165
 the tour 

00:02:14.165 --> 00:02:15.575
 of the square 

00:02:15.575 --> 00:02:19.184
 is equal to 4 times the length of the country. 

00:02:23.014 --> 00:02:24.421
 To repeat - it is clear, 

00:02:24.421 --> 00:02:25.717
 that we have a direct relationship. 

00:02:25.717 --> 00:02:28.621
 The tour is equal to a constant across the country, 

00:02:28.621 --> 00:02:30.745
 or the circumference divided by the length of the country, 

00:02:30.745 --> 00:02:31.904
 is equal to 4. 

00:02:31.904 --> 00:02:34.436
 We definitely have a direct relationship 

00:02:34.436 --> 00:02:37.245
 between the length of the country and the circumference.
