00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:02.380
INTERVIEWER 1: This is the
story of a random tip turned

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:05.280
wild goose chase through
the Central American jungle,

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:07.980
a ride on something
called a chicken bus,

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.150
and a man who is world
famous to travelers

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:13.495
but completely unknown to most
of the people in his own town.

00:00:13.495 --> 00:00:15.900
It's the story of this
man, Alberto Guiterrez.

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.040
The person who led the charge to
find Alberto and took the photo

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:24.820
was this woman.

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:25.611
JESSECA KEPPER: Hi.

00:00:25.611 --> 00:00:28.200
My name is Jesseca Kepper and
I'm an amateur photographer

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.730
from Atlanta, Georgia.

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.990
These photographs were
taken on a December morning

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:33.280
back in 2012.

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.860
INTERVIEWER 1: Alberto has
been visited, photographed,

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:37.530
and written about
on many travel blogs

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.500
and websites over the years.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:40.980
A quick Google
search will bring up

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.740
a lot of sites
offering information

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:44.780
on the Hermit of Nicaragua.

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.496
Jesseca first heard about him on
one of these backpacker blogs.

00:00:47.496 --> 00:00:48.870
JESSECA KEPPER:
We had originally

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.330
planned to spend the extra
week in Nicaragua scuba diving.

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.060
But when I found
out about Alberto,

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:55.840
we couldn't pass
up the opportunity

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.317
to track him down and
meet him for ourselves.

00:00:58.317 --> 00:00:59.900
The Corn Islands
would always be there

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.670
for our diving
adventures, but we

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.950
didn't know how long the
opportunity would be there

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:07.226
for us to meet a man who
had inspired so many.

00:01:07.226 --> 00:01:10.680
INTERVIEWER 1: The inspiration
Jesseca's talking about

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.610
comes from hundreds
of stone carvings

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.560
Alberto has made over the
years that decorate his home

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:16.650
and the land around him.

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.580
JESSECA KEPPER: The journey to
find Alberto Guiterrez included

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.864
a few hours on chicken buses
from Managua to Esteli.

00:01:22.864 --> 00:01:24.322
The next morning,
we hitched a ride

00:01:24.322 --> 00:01:27.560
with a local man about 30
minutes outside of town

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.846
to the dirt road where the
adventure really begins.

00:01:30.846 --> 00:01:33.190
INTERVIEWER 1: Eventually,
they asked some locals,

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:35.830
who told them to look for small
path that led through a pasture

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:37.745
and into the dense forest.

00:01:37.745 --> 00:01:40.950
JESSECA KEPPER: We walked for
probably 10 minutes or so.

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.390
Some barking dogs alerted
Allberto to our arrival.

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.750
You could feel his energy
and excitement the moment

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:47.800
he greeted us.

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.060
He walked us on trails all
over his property for over two

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.687
hours, passionately
explaining the inspiration

00:01:53.687 --> 00:01:54.520
behind the carvings.

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.410
He's in his early
70s, and he's lived

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:59.560
on this land his entire life.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.390
He said he's been carving
for over 35 years.

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.170
And he said he carves
three hours every morning,

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:06.750
except when he's sick.

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.910
It hard to say exactly
what Alberto is or isn't.

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.540
He's definitely a sculptor.

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:14.810
He's a farmer.

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:15.870
He's eccentric.

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.890
He's a character, for sure.

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.680
Alberto lives in
a one room house

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.860
where he had no running water,
no electricity, a dirt floor.

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.870
He's never driven a car.

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.800
And he has no concept
of the internet really.

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.280
And certainly no
true understanding

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.070
of how many people have access
to his story through it.

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:36.175
Yet his happiness and his
passion are incredible.

00:02:36.175 --> 00:02:37.800
INTERVIEWER 1: At
"This Happened Here",

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.650
we're always coming
up with creative ways

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.480
to tell stories through photos.

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.630
Domain.com is the place to go
when that next great idea hits

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:45.130
you.

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.860
It's a one-stop shop for all
of your domain and web hosting

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:48.610
needs.

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:50.360
Because you watched

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.100

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:57.560

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.270
This is actually Jesseca's
second story with us.

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:02.137
The first one is
about this photo.

00:03:02.137 --> 00:03:03.720
JESSECA KEPPER:
Roadside distractions,

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:04.920
as I like to call them.

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.680
I've been visiting them,
again, since I can remember.

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.560
But this one is
really a highlight

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.387
because of it's obscurity.

00:03:13.387 --> 00:03:14.970

We're always looking for
new stories to cover.

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.030
Thanks for watching.
