00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.840
Hi, I’m John Green, this is CrashCourse
US History, and today we’re going to talk

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:06.680
about the Cold War again. Really less about
the “cold,” more about the “war.”

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:10.220
As usual, we’re not going to focus so much
on the generals and the tactics, but instead

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:13.040
on why the wars were fought and what it all
meant.

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.949
And today we get to visit a part of the world
that we haven’t seen much on this series:

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:23.269
[spins] Asia. Not my best work.
intro

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:30.269
So, we’re gonna start today with the place
where the Cold War really heated up, at least

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:34.769
as far as America’s concerned.
Mr Green, it’s Vietnam.

00:00:34.769 --> 00:00:39.329
Close, Me from the Past, but like all your
romantic endeavors, unsuccessful. The correct

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.809
answer is of course Korea. Like MFTP, many
Americans have forgotten about the Korean

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:49.039
War, which lasted three years from 1950 to
1953 and is sometimes called the Forgotten

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:51.440
War.
But it was real. The Korean War was the first

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.230
real like shooting war that Americans were
involved in after World War II and it was

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.780
the only time that American troops directly
engaged with an honest to goodness Communist

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.460
power.
I’m referring not to North Korea, but to

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.940
China, which became communist in 1949 and
qualifies as a major world power because it

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:12.690
was, and also is, huge. We love you China.
Just kidding, you’re not watching. Because

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:15.910
of the Great Fire Wall.
So the end of WWII left Korea split between

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:20.950
a Communist north led by Kim Il crazypants
Sung and an anti-communist but hardly democratic

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.250
South led by Syngman Rhee.
The two were supposed to reunite, but that

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:29.610
was impossible because they were constantly
fighting that cost around 100,000 lives.

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.400
The civil war between the two Koreas turned
into a full-fledged international conflict

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:38.810
in June of 1950 when Kim Il Sung invaded the
South, and the US responded. Truman thought

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.250
that Kim’s invasion was being pushed by
the Soviets and that it was a challenge to

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.420
the “Free World.”
Truman went to the United Nations and he got

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.210
authorization, but he didn’t go to Congress
and never called the Korean War a “war.”

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.750
Insisting instead that American troops were
leading a UN “police action” but that

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.060
was kind of a misleading statement.
General Douglas MacArthur was in command of

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.660
this tiny little police force at the start
of the war because he was the highest ranking

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:05.810
general in the region. He was also really
popular, at least with the press, although

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.780
not so much with other generals, or with the
president.

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.890
Under MacArthur, UN forces – which basically
meant American and South Korean forces -- pushed

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.770
the North Koreans back past the 38th parallel
where the two countries had been divided,

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:22.940
and then Truman made a fateful decision: The
United States would try to re-unify Korea

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.140
as a non-communist state.
Which, if you’ve looked at a map recently,

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.590
you’ll notice went swimmingly. America’s
allies and the UN all agreed to this idea,

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:35.590
so up north they went, all the way to the
northern border with China at the Yalu river.

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.480
At that point, Chinese forces, feeling that
American forces were a smidge too close to

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.430
China, counter-attacked on November 1, 1950
and by Christmas the two sides were stalemated

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.780
again at the 38th parallel, right where they
started.

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.819
The war dragged on for two more years with
the U.S. pursuing a “scorched earth” policy

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:56.210
and dropping more bombs on Korea than had
been dropped in the entire Pacific theater

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:59.240
during WWII.
The two sides tried to negotiate a peace treaty,

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:03.010
but the sticking point was the repatriation
of North Korean and Chinese prisoners who

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.270
didn’t want to go back to their communist
homelands.

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:09.010
Meanwhile, at home, Americans were growing
tired of a war that they weren’t winning,

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.150
which helped to swing the election of 1952
for Dwight Eisenhower.

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.200
Also he was also running against perennial
presidential loser Adlai Stevenson, who was

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.740
perceived as an egghead intellectual because
his name was Adlai Stevenson.

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:24.100
In addition to helping get Ike elected, the
Korean War had a number of profound effects.

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:29.150
First and most importantly, it was expensive,
both in terms of lives and money.

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:35.740
In 3 years of fighting 33,629 Americans were
killed, 102,000 were wounded and nearly 4

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:41.440
million Koreans and Chinese were killed, wounded,
or missing. The majority of Korean casualties

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.630
were civilians.
The Korean War also further strengthened executive

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:48.709
power in the United States – Truman went
to war without a declaration and Congress

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:52.550
acquiesced – this doesn’t mean that the
war was initially was unpopular, it wasn’t.

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:56.560
People wanted to see America do something
about Communism and allowing Kim to take the

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.550
south and possibly threaten Japan was unacceptable.
However, the whole idea that you don’t really

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:05.680
need to declare war to go to war, while not
new in America, sure has been important the

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.599
last 60 years.
And the Korean War also strengthened the Cold

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:10.900
War mentality. I mean, this was the height
of the Red Scare.

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:15.860
Also, the Korean War set the stage for America’s
longer, more destructive, and more well known

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:21.759
engagement in Asia, the Vietnam War.
Oh it’s time for the Mystery Document? The

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:24.639
rules here are simple.
I guess the author of the Mystery Document.

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:28.210
I’m either right or I get shocked.
Alright, let’s see what we’ve got.

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:30.710
"The Declaration of the French Revolution
made in 1791 on the Rights of Man and the

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:35.559
Citizen also states: "All men are born free
and with equal rights, and must always remain

00:04:35.559 --> 00:04:39.460
free and have equal rights."
Those are undeniable truths.

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:43.550
Nevertheless, for more than eighty years,
the French imperialists, abusing the standard

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:47.849
of Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity, have
violated our Fatherland and oppressed our

00:04:47.849 --> 00:04:52.840
fellow citizens. They have acted contrary
to the ideals of humanity and justice.

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:58.680
In the field of politics, they have deprived
our people of every democratic liberty.

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:03.309
Well Stan that sounds like a Frenchman who
really doesn’t want to be French anymore.

00:05:03.309 --> 00:05:06.779
So it’s somebody who’s very disappointed
by the way the France has been running their

00:05:06.779 --> 00:05:10.620
colonies. I’m going to guess that it’s
North Vietnamese leader and Crash Course chalk

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:17.370
board person: Ho Chi Minh.
Wait Stan says he needs his real name. It’s

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:20.569
Nguyen Sinh Cung. Yes!
So, this document it points out that, at least

00:05:20.569 --> 00:05:24.710
rhetorically, Ho Chi Minh was fighting for
liberation from a colonial power as much as,

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:29.669
if not more than, he was trying to establish
a communist dictatorship in Vietnam. But because

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:34.740
of the Cold War and its prevailing theories,
the United States could only see Ho as a communist

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:38.789
stooge, a tool of the Kremlin.
Under the so-called “domino theory” Vietnam

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:42.870
was just another domino that had to be propped
up or else the rest of South East Asia would

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:46.539
fall to communism like a row of, dominos.
That wasn’t my best work.

00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:49.409
Now, in retrospect, this was a fundamental
misunderstanding, but it’s important to

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:53.620
remember that at the time, people felt that
they didn’t want the Soviet Union to expand

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:57.419
the way that, say, Nazi Germany had.
America’s involvement in Vietnam, like most

00:05:57.419 --> 00:06:01.900
things Cold War, dates back to World War II,
but it really picked up in the 1950s as we

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:06.629
threw our support behind the French in their
war to maintain their colonial empire. Wait,

00:06:06.629 --> 00:06:10.849
Stan, how why would we fight with the French
to maintain a colonial empire? Oh right, because

00:06:10.849 --> 00:06:15.180
we were blinded by our fear of communism.
Now, Eisenhower wisely refused to send troops

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:18.279
or use atomic weapons to help the French.
Really good call.

00:06:18.279 --> 00:06:22.430
And the Geneva Accords were supposed to set
up elections to reunite North and South, which

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:26.119
had been divided after WWII, but then we didn’t
let that happen.

00:06:26.119 --> 00:06:31.029
Because sometimes democracies don’t vote
for our guy. Instead, the U.S. began supporting

00:06:31.029 --> 00:06:35.580
the repressive, elitist regime of Ngo Dinh
Diem as a bulwark against communism.

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:39.289
Diem was a Catholic in a majority Buddhist
country and his support of landowners didn’t

00:06:39.289 --> 00:06:43.389
win him any fans. But he was against communism,
which was good enough for us.

00:06:43.389 --> 00:06:48.089
The first major involvement of American troops,
then called advisors, began in the early 1960s.

00:06:48.089 --> 00:06:53.050
Technically, their role was to advise the
Army of the Republic of Vietnam, also called

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:55.629
ARViN. It was doomed.
How did they not know this was doomed? Let’s

00:06:55.629 --> 00:07:01.610
fight for Arvin. Against this guy. You are
scary. Seriously.

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:05.740
Anyway, pretty quickly this advising turned
into shooting, and the first American advisors

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:08.689
were killed in 1961, during John Kennedy’s
presidency.

00:07:08.689 --> 00:07:13.129
However, most Americans consider Vietnam to
be Lyndon Johnson’s war, and they aren’t

00:07:13.129 --> 00:07:18.499
wrong. The major escalation of American troops
started under Johnson, especially in 1965

00:07:18.499 --> 00:07:21.610
after the Gulf of Tonkin incident.
This is one of the great incidents in all

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:27.009
of American history. So, in August 1964, North
Korean patrol boats attacked US warships in

00:07:27.009 --> 00:07:30.599
the Gulf of Tonkin.
As a result Johnson asked Congress to authorize

00:07:30.599 --> 00:07:36.710
the president to take “all necessary measures
to repel armed attack” in Vietnam, which

00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:40.509
Congress dutifully did with the Gulf of Tonkin
Resolution.

00:07:40.509 --> 00:07:43.779
So why is this one of the great incidents
in American history? Because the whole patrol

00:07:43.779 --> 00:07:48.819
boats attacking warships thing? That didn’t
happen. None of that stuff happened except

00:07:48.819 --> 00:07:52.749
we did actually go to war.
Now, in retrospect, this seems like a terrible

00:07:52.749 --> 00:07:57.899
idea but it was very popular at the time because
to quote the historian James Patterson, “Preventing

00:07:57.899 --> 00:08:01.979
Communism, after all, remained the guiding
star of American policy.”[1] Wait a second,

00:08:01.979 --> 00:08:07.369
did I just say to quote historian James Patterson,
like the crime novelist? Oh it’s a different

00:08:07.369 --> 00:08:10.729
guy apparently. That’s a bummer.
He doesn’t write his own books because he’s

00:08:10.729 --> 00:08:15.149
so busy with his secret career - being a historian.
So, the number of American troops began a

00:08:15.149 --> 00:08:19.979
steady increase and so did the bombing. The
frightfully named Operation Rolling Thunder

00:08:19.979 --> 00:08:24.889
began in the spring of 1965. And in March
of that year two Marine battalions arrived

00:08:24.889 --> 00:08:29.330
at Danang airbase authorized to attack the
enemy. No advising about it.

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:33.889
But, Johnson didn’t actually tell the American
public that our troops had this authorization,

00:08:33.889 --> 00:08:38.009
which was part of a widening credibility gap
between what the government told Americans

00:08:38.009 --> 00:08:41.699
about the war and what was really happening.
Let’s go to the ThoughtBubble.

00:08:41.699 --> 00:08:46.050
By 1968 there were about half a million American
soldiers in Vietnam and the government was

00:08:46.050 --> 00:08:50.380
confidently saying that victory was just around
the corner. But then in January Vietnamese

00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:54.399
forces launched the Tet Offensive and while
it was eventually repelled, the fact that

00:08:54.399 --> 00:08:58.610
the North Vietnamese were able to mount such
an offensive cast doubts on the claims that

00:08:58.610 --> 00:09:02.569
U.S. victory was imminent.
The Vietnam War itself was particularly brutal,

00:09:02.569 --> 00:09:06.990
with much of the ground fighting taking place
in jungles. Rather than large-scale offensives,

00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:11.329
troops were sent on search and destroy missions
and often it was difficult to tell enemy from

00:09:11.329 --> 00:09:16.170
civilians. Capturing territory wasn’t meaningful,
so commanders kept track of body counts. Like,

00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:20.089
if more enemy were killed than Americans,
we were winning.

00:09:20.089 --> 00:09:24.110
In addition to jungle fighting, there was
a lot of bombing. Like, more bombs were dropped

00:09:24.110 --> 00:09:30.819
on North and South Vietnam than both the Axis
and Allied powers used in all of World War

00:09:30.819 --> 00:09:34.350
II. The U.S. used chemical defoliants like
Agent Orange to get rid of that pesky jungle,

00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:38.430
and also napalm, which was used to burn trees,
homes, and people.

00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:42.180
Television coverage meant that Vietnam was
the first war brought into American living

00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:46.250
rooms. And people were horrified at what they
saw. They were especially shocked at the My

00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:52.180
Lai massacre, which took place in 1968 but
was only reported a year later, in 1969. These

00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:55.880
draftees were young, and disproportionately
from the lower classes because enrollment

00:09:55.880 --> 00:10:01.029
in college or grad school earned you a deferment.
So unlike previous American wars, the burden

00:10:01.029 --> 00:10:05.009
of fighting did not fall evenly across socioeconomic
class.

00:10:05.009 --> 00:10:08.750
Thanks, ThoughtBubble. So, as Americans at
home became increasingly aware of what was

00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:12.730
going on in Vietnam, protests started. But
it’s important to remember that the majority

00:10:12.730 --> 00:10:18.009
of Americans were not out in the streets or
on college campuses burning their draft cards.

00:10:18.009 --> 00:10:24.050
Right up through 1968 and maybe even 1970,
most Americans supported the Vietnam War.

00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:28.519
During the 1968 presidential campaign, Richard
Nixon promised that he had a secret plan to

00:10:28.519 --> 00:10:32.709
end the war and appealed to the silent majority
of Americans who weren’t on board with the

00:10:32.709 --> 00:10:35.509
anti-war movement.
So, the first part of Nixon’s secret plan

00:10:35.509 --> 00:10:40.540
was “vietnamization” -- gradually withdrawing
American troops and leaving the fighting to

00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:43.550
the Vietnamese.
The second part involved more bombing and

00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:48.440
actually escalating the war by sending American
troops into Cambodia in order to cut off the

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:54.310
so-called Ho Chi Minh, named for this guy,
a supply line that connected north to south.

00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:59.220
Not only did this not work, it also destabilized
Cambodia and helped the Khmer Rouge to come

00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:02.300
to power.
The Khmer Rouge represented the absolute worst

00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:07.180
that Communism had to offer, forcing almost
all Cambodians into communes and massacring

00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:14.180
one third of the country’s population.
So, not a great secret plan. By 1970 the anti-protests

00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:18.990
had grown and discontent within the armed
forces was enormous.

00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:23.269
Vietnam veterans, including future almost-president
John Kerry, were participating in protests.

00:11:23.269 --> 00:11:28.649
And things got even worse when in 1971 the
New York Times published the Pentagon Papers,

00:11:28.649 --> 00:11:32.310
classified documents that showed that the
government had been misleading the public

00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:36.029
about the war for years.
Congress eventually responded by passing the

00:11:36.029 --> 00:11:40.850
War Powers Act in 1973 which was supposed
to limit the president’s ability to send

00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:45.709
troops overseas without their approval and
prevent another Gulf of Tonkin Resolution.

00:11:45.709 --> 00:11:50.139
John: How does that work out, Stan?
Stan: Not great.

00:11:50.139 --> 00:11:54.610
John: Yeah. I’ll say.
After five years of negotiations, Nixon and

00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:59.350
his secretary of state Henry Kissinger were
able to end America’s involvement in Vietnam.

00:11:59.350 --> 00:12:04.199
In 1973 the Paris Peace Agreement made it
possible for America to withdraw its troops,

00:12:04.199 --> 00:12:04.550
although it left North Korea in control of
some of South Vietnam.

00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:09.589
The war between North and South Vietnam however
continued until 1975 when the North finally

00:12:09.589 --> 00:12:12.800
conquered the South and created a single,
communist Vietnam.

00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:17.879
The Vietnam War cost the United States more
than $100 billion spent, 58,000 Americans

00:12:17.879 --> 00:12:21.490
died as well as between 3 and 4 million Vietnamese
people

00:12:21.490 --> 00:12:27.160
And Vietnam was the first war in America that
we definitively lost. We lost it because we

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:31.250
didn’t understand the Vietnamese and we
didn’t understand why they were fighting.

00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:35.449
To return to the historian James Patterson,
“the unyielding determination of the enemy

00:12:35.449 --> 00:12:40.069
… wore down the American commitment, which
proved to be far less resolute.”[2]

00:12:40.069 --> 00:12:44.360
America expected that its superior technology
and wealth would eventually wear down the

00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:49.629
Vietnamese and they’d just give up communism.
But the Vietnamese weren’t fighting for

00:12:49.629 --> 00:12:53.579
communism. They were fighting for Vietnam.
This fundamental misunderstanding combined

00:12:53.579 --> 00:12:58.060
with the government’s dishonesty changed
American’s relationship with their leaders.

00:12:58.060 --> 00:13:02.459
Before Vietnam, most Americans trusted their
government, even when they knew it did horrible

00:13:02.459 --> 00:13:08.089
things. But, after the war, and largely because
of it, that trust was gone. Thanks for watching.

00:13:08.089 --> 00:13:10.990
