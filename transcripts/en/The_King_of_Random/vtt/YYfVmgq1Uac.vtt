00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400
[Captions by Y Translator]
Guys, we are back once again
with my friend Joseph,

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:05.480
and today, we're going to use some of
the things we've made before...

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:07.300
Including the bag bellows
from the previous video,

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:08.300
and this furnace

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:10.000
that was teased also
in the previous video.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:10.700
And today,

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.722
we are going to try
and extract iron, from iron ore.

00:00:13.722 --> 00:00:22.000
[Music]

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.260
&gt;&gt; So, blacksmithing is primitive.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.240
You're like raw, dealing
with the elements,

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:26.400
beating on a piece of iron,

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.000
but where did the blacksmith
get the iron?

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:30.640
And that's what
we're doing today.

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.500
We are going to make iron.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.200
&gt; So what materials are we
going to start with?

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.500
I know we've got our bellows,
and we've got our bloom furnace,

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.980
which is basically
a cylinder of clay.

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.900
&gt;&gt; Yes, a cylinder of clay
with a hole in the bottom,

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.300
so that we can pump air into it.

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:42.800
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.040
What else do we need?

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.800
&gt;&gt; We need to make
basically a lasagna

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.400
out of ore and charcoal.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.700
And what's going to happen is,
as the fire burns,

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.200
it's going to sink
down into the fire.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.200
And what we're going

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.000
to keep doing is adding
a little bit more charcoal,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.272
and then a little bit more ore,

00:00:55.382 --> 00:00:58.072
and it's going to make layers,
like lasagna on its way down.

00:00:58.832 --> 00:01:00.900
And on its way down, 
It's going to get hot,

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:04.000
but the heat is not
what converts this into metal.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.500
You can get this crazy hot,

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.700
and what you would have
is molten red rocks.

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:08.600
In order to make iron,

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.300
you need a chemical
reaction to happen.

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:11.400
And for that,

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.200
our secret ingredient
is charcoal.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.900
Charcoal is basically
pure carbon,

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.200
and when it burns,
it produces carbon monoxide.

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.400
This is why you should
never ever burn it inside.

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.400
The temperature is going to melt

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.900
off all of the glassy
stuff, all the silica,

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.500
and then the carbon monoxide
is literally going to rip

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.932
off oxygen atoms
from the iron ore,

00:01:29.252 --> 00:01:30.100
leaving us with iron.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.600
&gt;&gt; So we've got this full.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.500
There's a little bit
of wood down at the bottom.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.900
The top layer is pretty much
all charcoal this point,

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.500
and then we have
our first batch of iron oxide.

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.200
It's not even slightly warm yet,

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.300
because not much oxygen
is getting into this.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.380
So the fire is staying very low,

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.500
until we use the bellows
to flood it with oxygen,

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.100
and just get it blazing hot.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.900
&gt;&gt; And you can think of it
in different temperature zones.

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:52.500
Up here, it's
like just drying off,

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.600
if there's any moisture
in the ore or the charcoal.

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.000
And as it gets
a little bit lower,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:56.600
it'll heat up,

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:57.800
and then right around here,

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.122
it'll get hot enough
that it will start converting.

00:02:00.692 --> 00:02:02.500
And then, it will get close
to the oxygen again,

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.900
but what we're pumping
in is oxygen,

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.840
and that's exactly the thing
we're trying to get rid of.

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.600
So what will happen is
the iron bits are going

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:10.700
to turn into iron,

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.100
and then as the come past here,

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.300
there's a danger
that will turn back into rust.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:15.300
Fortunately,

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.602
we have a secret ingredient,
also included an ore,

00:02:17.742 --> 00:02:19.700
and that is the glassy
stuff, the sand.

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:20.900
And so that's going to melt

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.522
and coat all of those little
particles of ore,

00:02:23.592 --> 00:02:24.800
protecting them from the oxygen

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.600
until they settle down here,
in the bottom zone of the fire.

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:28.860
&gt;&gt; Let's pump some air.

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:29.820
Let's do it.

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:47.540
[Music]

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.880
So we're doing right here is
we are pre-roasting the ore.

00:02:50.022 --> 00:02:52.152
This is particularly useful
for hydrated ores,

00:02:52.252 --> 00:02:52.682
in other words,

00:02:52.682 --> 00:02:55.000
ores that have water molecules
bound it onto them,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.400
similar to the way that concrete
has water bound on to it,

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.100
and so, what we're doing
is we're roasting it,

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.800
and the other thing

00:02:59.812 --> 00:03:02.500
that it does is it makes
it way easier to grind

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.500
to down into the pea
gravel and powder size

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:06.700
that we need to put
it in the furnace.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.580
Joseph and I tried grinding
this up, like normal,

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:10.620
and it was miserable.

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.100
So roasting it as a good thing.

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.200
When you find reddish rocks,

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.840
like in say,
the Grand Canyon area,

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.900
it doesn't take very
much iron to stay in rock red.

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.100
So just because it's red,

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.600
doesn't mean there's
a lot of iron there.

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.200
The first smelt I did
with iron failed miserably

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.600
because I had red rocks,

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.100
and I assumed
that they were iron.

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.700
Turns out,

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.400
they only had like
three percent iron,

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.292
and tested that
after I failed with it.

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:41.760
[Music]

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:42.900
&gt;&gt; All right, we want
to do an update.

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.860
This has been running
for several hours,

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:48.200
and, although we did use
the bag bellows for many hours,

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.700
we also did decide it's okay
if we cheat a little bit.

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:52.000
&gt;&gt; Especially since we
ran into a problem

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.700
where we were not going

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.900
through enough ore fast enough
to finish within like a day.

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.460
In order to speed things up,
we got an electric air pump,

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:59.800
and that goes a lot faster.

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.600
The bag bellows was working.

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.600
We were getting
everything processing.

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.240
It was just processing slowly.

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:06.600
&gt;&gt; And it was so cool.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.200
Well, except for the fact
that it was hot in the sun,

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.400
and next to a 2000
degree furnace.

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.220
But other than that,
it was cool.

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:14.400
&gt;&gt; We opened up the back

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.172
of it to try and let
some slag burn out.

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:17.900
Slag is everything

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:19.600
that's in the iron ore
that isn't the iron itself,

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:20.300
and we found

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:24.000
that we believe we have
a good sized lump of iron.

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.120
&gt;&gt; Now, this could be
just a bunch of slag,

00:04:27.312 --> 00:04:29.400
or it could be a bunch
of iron and slag,

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.000
so we can cool that off.
&gt;&gt; Cool that off first.

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.240
Yeah, let's put
that in a bucket of water.

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:48.620
[Music]

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:51.000
What do you think it was,
mostly iron or mostly slag?

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.232
&gt;&gt; Mostly slag.
&gt;&gt; Mostly slag.

00:04:52.232 --> 00:04:53.900
Okay, big old blob of slag.

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:55.832
So the way to tell is
you whack it with a hammer.

00:04:55.832 --> 00:04:57.012
If it shatters, it's slag.

00:04:57.012 --> 00:04:58.000
If it dents, it's iron.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:58.800
And as you can see,

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.300
it's probably a little
over 200 degrees.

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.200
The cool thing about this is
the partially reduced bits,

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:04.700
I can just throw
back on the fire,

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:05.920
and we can recycle this.

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:15.340
[Music]

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:16.000
&gt;&gt; At this point,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.300
we have enough heat
in our bloom furnace

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:20.592
that we have slag pouring out.

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:22.400
This stuff looks like lava,

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.100
and since a lot
of its melted rock,

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:25.172
it kind of is lava.

00:05:25.172 --> 00:05:27.000
It's just lava from rocks

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.312
that used to have
a lot of iron in it.

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:32.380
[Music]

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:34.800
Getting slag this runny
is a good sign

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.200
because it usually means
there is a higher concentration

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:39.260
of iron in the ore,

00:05:39.482 --> 00:05:40.000
and so the fact

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.660
that we are seeing this
as a very good sign.

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:44.000
Slag is [inaudible]

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:46.300
&gt;&gt; Yes, holy crap!

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:47.440
That is iron.

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:55.500
[Music]

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:58.000
So, the furnace has been burning
for a very, very long time.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.012
You may notice from the lighting
that it's late afternoon.

00:06:00.522 --> 00:06:02.600
And what we've done is
we've managed to get

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:04.780
through all the ore
in those layers,

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:06.940
and I can feel with this thing

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:10.800
that there's a big lump
of something right there.

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.040
Is it iron?

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:13.580
Please be iron.

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:22.120
[Music]

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:23.060
&gt;&gt; Now you can see how thick
the walls are on this thing.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:25.740
Oh boy.

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:28.580
That's a big old
blob of something.

00:06:30.342 --> 00:06:31.100
&gt;&gt; Is it iron?

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:32.500
&gt;&gt; I can't tell yet.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.520
&gt;&gt; I'm going to clear out
some of that charcoal.

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:38.840
And again, right here.

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:44.900
[Music]

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:45.520
&gt;&gt; More?
&gt;&gt; More.

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:46.040
Yes.

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:47.940
Keep going.

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:48.780
Nice.

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:50.240
Okay.

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:51.660
Is it loose?

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:53.640
&gt;&gt; Not really.

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:55.260
Oh, come on.

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:57.120
Where are you?

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:03.300

to cracking that.

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:11.200
That is an iron bloom.

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:27.700
&gt;&gt; Should I get my hands dirty?

&gt;&gt; Yes, please do.

to get a piece out,

00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:45.540
put it on this wooden anvil,
and then compress it.

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:51.140
Whack it!

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:53.600
Now's the time to compress.

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:55.200
Nate, go for broke.

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:56.600
You want to be gentle at first,

00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:59.460
but see if you can get
it compressing on itself at all.

00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:03.780
[Music]

00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:05.080
&gt;&gt; It looks like a meteor.

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:06.000
&gt;&gt; It does.

00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:10.392
You can see it deforming at all?

00:08:10.392 --> 00:08:10.962
&gt;&gt; I think so.

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:12.280
&gt;&gt; Nice.

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:29.200
[Music]

00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:29.860
No!

00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:36.100
[Music]

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:38.600
Okay, so this purplish red rust
that we see up here,

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:40.400
that's a really good sign,

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:42.280
as is that bluish
stuff right there.

00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:43.380
Like this...

00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:45.572
&gt;&gt; Hold that [inaudible].
&gt;&gt; That lump maybe.

00:08:45.572 --> 00:08:47.042
This is iron.

00:08:47.042 --> 00:08:49.700
I'm going to join a heavy metal band
because of how awesome this feels.

00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:50.600
That is so cool.

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:51.400
&gt;&gt; So there's...

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:53.100
Is there still slag in this,

00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:55.000
or do you think this is
pure iron at this point?

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.100
&gt;&gt; This is got tons of slag,

00:08:57.100 --> 00:08:58.920
and probably even
some charcoal in it.

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:00.500
&gt;&gt; All right Joseph,

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:03.100
so we started out
with a bunch of red dirt.

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:04.332
&gt;&gt; Yes.
And a bunch of charcoal.

00:09:04.332 --> 00:09:05.800
Well actually,
we start out with red rocks,

00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:08.800
and we had to grind them down
painstakingly into red dirt.

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:09.400
Yes.

00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:11.600
&gt;&gt; So we just burned it
for like six or seven hours.

00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:12.100
Yes.

00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:14.600
&gt;&gt; Yes, we just burn it for six to seven hours.
&gt;&gt; And now we got this.

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:16.200
Yep.
Very cool.

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:18.000
So this right here
should be able to be turned

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.200
into a block of iron,

00:09:19.242 --> 00:09:20.700
similar to what Joseph
has made before.

00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:22.700
To get this to turn
into something like that,

00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:24.862
it will involve some heat,
some hammering,

00:09:24.862 --> 00:09:26.100
maybe gathering up pieces

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:28.900
as it smashes out all
the remaining slag and charcoal

00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:30.560
that's stuck in this.

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:34.000
But this should have quite a bit
of good refinable iron in it.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.900
And next, Joseph
is going to take this,

00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:38.100
and turn it into a brick,
kind of like this,

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:40.100
and at that point,
you can start blacksmithing it.

00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:41.000
&gt;&gt; So hardcore!

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.400
This is so cool!

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:44.380
Yeah!

00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:47.220
&gt;&gt; He's a little bit excited.

00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:48.640
Yeah, this is pretty cool.

00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:52.100
I haven't done this five times
before to varying levels

00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:54.200
of success to have
his seen level of excitement,

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:56.840
but I am quite happy
that this turned out.

00:09:56.900 --> 00:09:58.712
I'm quite happy
for the knowledge he already had

00:09:58.712 --> 00:10:00.992
and shared with us
to make sure this did turn out,

00:10:01.522 --> 00:10:03.732
and I'm really interested to see
what gets made out of it.

00:10:03.842 --> 00:10:04.672
&gt;&gt; Thanks. I'll have to show you.

00:10:04.672 --> 00:10:05.282
It would be great.

00:10:06.422 --> 00:10:08.400
&gt;&gt; Guys, that's it for today,
but there's always more for you to see.

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:10.802
That box up at the top
will take you to our last video,

00:10:10.802 --> 00:10:12.160
and you should check
that one out.

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:13.200
The other box will show you

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:14.800
what YouTube thinks you
should do watching next,

00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:16.200
and if you hit this bomb
in the middle,

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:17.600
you will be subscribe
to the channel,

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:19.400
and that way, you'll never miss
out on a cool video.

00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:20.400
Don't forget to ring that bell,

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:21.600
and we will see you
in the next one.

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:22.620
Talk to you then.
