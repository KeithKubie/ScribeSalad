00:00:00.238 --> 00:00:01.472
- [Instructor] Let's now see if

00:00:01.472 --> 00:00:03.929
we can come up with the chemical formula

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.179
for the ionic compound calcium bromide.

00:00:08.117 --> 00:00:11.217
And like always, if you are
inspired, pause the video

00:00:11.217 --> 00:00:14.191
and see if you can come
up with it on your own.

00:00:14.191 --> 00:00:16.659
All right, so the
convention is that we write

00:00:16.659 --> 00:00:20.261
the positive ion first and
so that's a pretty good clue

00:00:20.261 --> 00:00:23.418
that calcium is going
to be the positive ion.

00:00:23.418 --> 00:00:25.706
Now let's look at the
periodic table to confirm

00:00:25.706 --> 00:00:30.666
that it's likely that calcium
would ionize as a cation.

00:00:30.666 --> 00:00:35.258
Well, calcium is right
over here in Group Two,

00:00:35.258 --> 00:00:39.425
and Group Two elements, also
known as alkaline earth metals,

00:00:40.319 --> 00:00:43.826
they tend to ionize by
losing two electrons and

00:00:43.826 --> 00:00:45.706
that's because they have two electrons

00:00:45.706 --> 00:00:48.547
in their outermost shell and
they would like to lose them.

00:00:48.547 --> 00:00:53.096
And so when calcium
ionizes, it is going to be,

00:00:53.096 --> 00:00:56.013
it is going to ionize as Ca2+.

00:00:59.187 --> 00:01:02.660
Now, let's look at the bromide part.

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.827
The -ide tells us that this
is going to be a negative ion

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:10.359
or it's going to be an anion.

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:13.871
And if you look at where bromine
sits in our periodic table,

00:01:13.871 --> 00:01:16.900
right over here, we see it is a halide.

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.787
We see that it likes to gain an electron

00:01:20.787 --> 00:01:24.537
and so it makes sense that
it's going to be our anion.

00:01:24.537 --> 00:01:28.287
And so bromine would
like to gain an electron

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.150
to have eight electrons
in its outermost shell.

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:36.461
So, our bromide anion is
going to look like this.

00:01:36.461 --> 00:01:38.384
It's going be to 1-.

00:01:38.384 --> 00:01:40.782
It's gonna wanna gain an electron,

00:01:40.782 --> 00:01:44.644
that's what the elements
in this group like to do.

00:01:44.644 --> 00:01:46.595
Now, what is the formula going to be,

00:01:46.595 --> 00:01:50.447
and remember, the key here
is for an ionic compound,

00:01:50.447 --> 00:01:52.901
especially one that
has, well, we don't see

00:01:52.901 --> 00:01:57.245
any net charge here,
for an ionic compound,

00:01:57.245 --> 00:01:59.749
these things are going
to cancel each other out.

00:01:59.749 --> 00:02:02.416
The charge of the calcium cation

00:02:03.581 --> 00:02:07.414
is going to cancel out
with the bromide anion.

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:10.967
So how is that going to happen?

00:02:10.967 --> 00:02:14.354
Well, have you 2+ here,
you only have 1- here,

00:02:14.354 --> 00:02:17.001
so you're gonna have to have two bromides

00:02:17.001 --> 00:02:19.501
for every of the calcium ions.

00:02:20.433 --> 00:02:24.739
So this is going to be, for
every one of the calciums,

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:27.013
you're going to have two bromides.

00:02:27.013 --> 00:02:29.225
So it's going to be like this,

00:02:29.225 --> 00:02:32.142
Br2, and there you have it, that is

00:02:33.026 --> 00:02:36.788
the chemical formula for calcium bromide.

00:02:36.788 --> 00:02:37.866
And how did we know that we have

00:02:37.866 --> 00:02:40.871
two bromides for every calcium?

00:02:40.871 --> 00:02:44.722
Well, because when calcium
ionizes, it's going to be 2+,

00:02:44.722 --> 00:02:47.656
it's a Group Two element right over here.

00:02:47.656 --> 00:02:51.156
And bromine only gets a -1 or a 1- charge,

00:02:52.552 --> 00:02:54.439
so you're gonna need two of the bromides

00:02:54.439 --> 00:02:56.939
for every one of the calciums.
