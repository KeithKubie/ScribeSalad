 Dear viewers, curious minds and explorers of the world! 

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:06.160
 Do not miss us that many people - plus us - 

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:09.120
 They enjoy playing Pokemon Goo 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.800
 It gives a sense of adventure, and goes out to explore the world and increase them all 

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.880
 But my dear friends, please do not forget the ookimans in real life 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:18.800
 You know, like: 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.780
 Pokemon electric, poisonous and watery 

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:23.020
 Watering 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:26.220
 It is the only poisonous breast that can whiten 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.180
 Do not forget to have electrical receptors to locate the frist 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.540
 What about the most ambiguous, 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.540
 Pokemon for the land of the blind: the raccoon 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:40.340
 Uses high intelligence to remember solutions and tasks up to 3 years 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.020
 * I remember this garbage * There are certainly a lot of rare bochemons around the planet as well. 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.160
 Try searching for the Earthmind: the star-nosed mole 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.380
 Who has 22 greasy plus in his nose 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:54.020
 Hosts 25.000 sensory sensory receptors 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.160
 Or a blue sea dragon from nude gills 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.160
 Which floats upside down in the water 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.800
 By surface tension and camouflage with water 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.880
 This tree hopper is a rare bacterium and bacterium 

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:08.100
 With horn-like extensions or a helmet 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.380
 And what is Pokemon? 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.800
 Okay ! It's a bat fish, which is used 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.880
 The flap of the bra to walk on the surface of the ocean 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.480
 And something on his head to attract his prey 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.640
 The charm of the Pokemon Goo is completely enchanting to your liking 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.340
 You may not want to fight against a rhinoceros beetle 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.020
 This fighter can lift a weight greater than 850 times 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.900
 If you have this power, you can carry up to 2-8 servings 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.380
 While hunting for Katrby, why not look for a drink 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.000
 Amazing creatures that can transform from one shape to another 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.440
 Many of them make metal-like crystals in this process 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:44.480
 Find Baiji? 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.960
 Look around you may see a dove too

 This amazing bird can learn to differentiate every letter of spelling 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.600
 Many of them have a unique ability to find their way home 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.880
 Through vast areas using magnetic receptors 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.200
 If you pass on the iPod, 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.920
 It will never bother you to stop and check the local rocks 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.220
 That you should actually lose some of them 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.140
 These Pokemon have always been around us 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.780
 That is why we are presenting the challenge of "Pokemon in real life" 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.840
