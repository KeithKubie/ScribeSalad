00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.720
- Good morning, I hope
you're having an amazing day.

00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:04.210
It's Mark Wiens, I'm in
Chanthaburi, Thailand.

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:07.250
And Chanthaburi is very well
known for their seafood.

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:09.900
And so today is gonna be an amazing day.

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.530
We're about to meet up, well actually,

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:14.270
we're about to get picked up on a boat

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:17.470
by Lum Tom, which means Uncle Tom.

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:19.430
Uncle Tom is known for his oysters,

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:20.920
he's known for his seafood,

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.690
he's gonna pick us up in a boat,

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:25.014
we're gonna go to his oyster farm.

00:00:25.014 --> 00:00:27.400
I'm not exactly sure
where he's gonna take us,

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.080
but then he's gonna take us to eat seafood

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.820
at his restaurant, it looks like it,

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:33.860
it's gonna be a thrilling day,
and I'm gonna share it all

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:35.510
with you in this video right now.

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:41.920
If you're just joining me on this series,

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.270
this is day two of our
eastern provinces of Thailand

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.300
food and travel trip.

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.190
From Chanthaburi town we
drove out to the pier.

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:50.940
And this pier is called Pah-chah-lay-up.

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.710
It's about a fifteen minute drive

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.453
and Uncle Tom should be pulling
up in his boat very soon.

00:00:58.507 --> 00:01:01.710
- (speaking in foreign language)

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.289
- [Mark] Honey, can you
just set it in there?

00:01:04.289 --> 00:01:08.372
- (speaking in foreign language)

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.346
- We met up with Uncle Tom, Lum Tom.

00:01:14.346 --> 00:01:15.693
(speaking in foreign language)

00:01:15.693 --> 00:01:16.526
- (speaking in foreign language)

00:01:16.526 --> 00:01:20.791
- He was here right on time
to pick us up, and we are off.

00:01:20.791 --> 00:01:23.541
(motor rattling)

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:28.482
(lighthearted synthesizer music)

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:40.000
Oh yeah, this is just
fantastic, the ocean breeze.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.290
This area has a lot of mangrove forests

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.760
and a lot of brackish water as well.

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.110
So I think we're gonna cruise around,

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.160
but the highlight is gonna be

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:48.800
when we go to Uncle Tom's oyster farm.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.530
And he's gonna harvest
fresh oysters for us.

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:52.860
He just said in those nets,

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.213
they are farming macau which are grouper.

00:01:57.214 --> 00:02:00.797
(lighthearted synthesizer)

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.350
This area next to the
mangroves and by the coast

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:14.214
is all brackish water, so
it's a mix of salt water

00:02:14.214 --> 00:02:15.773
plus fresh water.

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.370
And by the way, for this entire trip,

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:19.540
we're gonna be taking some boats,

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.300
so we got Micah his very own life jacket,

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.030
which I'm pretty excited about.

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.993
And he is, too.

00:02:27.458 --> 00:02:31.041
(lighthearted synthesizer)

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.337
(motor put-putting)

00:02:36.337 --> 00:02:40.420
- (speaking in foreign language)

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.800
- That was about a 30 minute boat ride

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.860
and we have arrived to his oyster plot.

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.020
Oh, I am excited, this is very cool.

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.880
But he was telling us
that some of the oysters,

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.221
they take one and a half
years or even three years

00:02:53.221 --> 00:02:56.329
to grow to their full size.

00:02:56.329 --> 00:03:00.412
- (speaking in foreign language)

00:03:06.866 --> 00:03:10.212
- [Woman] (speaking in foreign language)

00:03:10.212 --> 00:03:14.295
- (speaking in foreign language)

00:03:26.151 --> 00:03:30.901
- [Woman] (speaking in foreign language)

00:03:32.149 --> 00:03:36.316
- (speaking in foreign language)

00:03:37.312 --> 00:03:40.690
Wow, yeah, you could do
some curls with this,

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:42.020
that's for sure.

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:43.703
- [Tom] Okay, helping Mark up.

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:52.047
(speaking in foreign language)

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.640
- This is so cool, and the
way that they grow the oysters

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.820
is that they attach them to the strings,

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:09.630
and so they have a string of oysters

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:13.180
so that they just hang
down into the ocean.

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:14.560
Then they just grow along that string

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.628
so that you have them already collected

00:04:16.628 --> 00:04:18.673
when you need to eat them.

00:04:21.633 --> 00:04:26.216
- [Tom] (speaking in foreign language)

00:04:44.429 --> 00:04:46.530
- That was very cool
to see, we are now off

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:50.010
to the restaurant, or his
place where he takes you

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:51.093
to eat seafood.

00:04:52.574 --> 00:04:56.657
(lighthearted synthesizer music)

00:05:04.416 --> 00:05:07.416
(motor put-putting)

00:05:08.924 --> 00:05:13.507
- [Tom] (speaking in foreign language)

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:20.690
- Oh, man, this is just
absolutely awesome,

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:24.800
an entire floating bamboo
hut, a seafood palace,

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.163
in the middle of the water.

00:05:27.238 --> 00:05:29.010
The peace and the
quietness, this is awesome.

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:30.270
Oh, they have a homestay here, too,

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:32.580
so you can actually stay here in this room

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.170
on the floating bamboo dock.

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:35.510
Uncle Tom is absolutely awesome.

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:40.510
He is preparing a bed now for
Micah to take a little nap.

00:05:49.725 --> 00:05:51.350
You can just smell the aromas of seafood

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:54.003
wafting through the seafood-y air.

00:05:57.518 --> 00:06:02.454
- [Woman] (speaking in foreign language)

00:06:02.454 --> 00:06:05.121
(oil crackling)

00:06:20.832 --> 00:06:22.832
- Shh, Micah passed out.

00:06:25.464 --> 00:06:29.547
(lighthearted synthesizer music)

00:06:52.314 --> 00:06:56.897
- [Tom] (speaking in foreign language)

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:06.603
- [Mark] First time I ever saw
you take photos of the food.

00:07:10.467 --> 00:07:14.550
- (speaking in foreign language)

00:07:15.705 --> 00:07:20.705
- [Woman] (speaking in foreign language)

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:24.260
- We are sitting down for this borderline

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.970
ridiculous quantity of seafood.

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:29.480
This is a gigantic seafood feast.

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:32.620
And everything is cooked
right here on the dock,

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:37.270
everything is fresh, the
oysters are what is like

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:40.700
shining though, that's like
the sun is shining at me.

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:42.680
Oh there's just nothing
like these oysters,

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:46.435
they are massive, you can
just see them kind of melting

00:07:46.435 --> 00:07:49.240
and kind of like slurping around.

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:52.720
Oh he just freshly opened
these, I gotta try one as is,

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:54.870
immediately, I'm going
for that center guy.

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:58.210
Yeah, look at the size of that,

00:07:58.210 --> 00:08:00.940
and I'm gonna, I just have
to eat this one straight.

00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:03.931
But after this one, I will show you

00:08:03.931 --> 00:08:04.764
how to eat it Thai style.

00:08:04.764 --> 00:08:05.630
This is one of those oysters where

00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:06.980
you're not really sure how to go in.

00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:08.930
If you go in from the
top and kind of slurp it

00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:11.440
or if you just kind of
pour it into your mouth.

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:14.270
Ah, let me see, oh yeah,
it's already loosened, too.

00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:16.770
Okay, I'll go for the
pouring method in that case.

00:08:20.256 --> 00:08:22.506
(laughing)

00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:29.150
Oh that's just as unbelievably
fresh as it can get.

00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:33.040
It has zero like kind of
foul off kind of smell

00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:35.600
or taste to it, it's so pure.

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:38.253
It's like jelly, it melts in your mouth.

00:08:38.253 --> 00:08:41.810
These particular oysters
are not that salty, either.

00:08:41.810 --> 00:08:43.520
Maybe that's because they're
in the brackish water,

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:48.360
but you don't have like that
overwhelming salty gushiness.

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:52.270
They taste fresh and
clean and unbelievable.

00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:54.220
For my next oyster, we
gotta do it Thai style.

00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:57.420
So what you do first is you
apply some nam prik pao,

00:08:57.420 --> 00:08:59.290
which is the roasted chili jam.

00:08:59.290 --> 00:09:02.380
I'm gonna add some of that
right onto the top there.

00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:06.560
Next up for hong jiao, these
are fried crispy shallots.

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:08.750
There might be a little
bit of garlic in here, too.

00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:11.340
I'm going all in on that.

00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:12.700
Those look kind of like cornflakes,

00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:14.810
but I can assure you, they are shallots.

00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:17.940
Next, for a chili, and a
little piece of garlic,

00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:21.680
on top there, a clove of garlic, a chili,

00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:23.320
and next you add some nam jim seafood,

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:24.680
which is the seafood sauce.

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:26.580
There's lime in here, there's
chilies and garlic in here,

00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:27.413
already, too.

00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:32.163
A little bit of this, maybe a
little more for good measure.

00:09:33.247 --> 00:09:35.510
Looks ridiculous.

00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:38.070
Okay, I think I got all the components.

00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:39.670
Except there is something that

00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:41.370
you have to chase it with as well.

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:44.860
That is just absolutely insanely beautiful

00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:45.950
with all those toppings.

00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:47.623
Maybe I should spoon this guy.

00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:51.210
Oh, look at the size,
oh this one goes deep.

00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:55.260
Oh, look at that, okay,
maybe I should spoon this.

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.690
Spoon it out and then
eat it from the spoon.

00:09:57.690 --> 00:09:59.970
You can barely fit that into the spoon.

00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:02.720
Oh, and I lost the garlic,
okay, I'd better grab that,

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:07.720
that garlic, let me put that
garlic right back on top.

00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:11.480
Wow, this is a giant oyster one-biter

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:15.080
and I don't really wanna eat
the whole thing in one bite,

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:17.800
well, it will be kind of fun, but I don't,

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:20.960
I just don't know of
another way to, sorry for,

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:22.700
okay what I wanna say is just sorry

00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:25.073
for the giant bite I'm about to take.

00:10:26.417 --> 00:10:28.680
But I think that really is the best way

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:30.550
to eat this oyster, I
mean if you bite into it,

00:10:30.550 --> 00:10:33.722
you risk loosing all
the toppings or, okay.

00:10:33.722 --> 00:10:37.805
(lighthearted synthesizer music)

00:10:42.410 --> 00:10:44.860
And then the final step,
you chase it with gatin.

00:10:50.056 --> 00:10:53.520
And that completes the
Thai oyster one-biter.

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:58.150
Mmm, they have it totally figured out.

00:10:58.150 --> 00:11:00.570
You got the oyster, that slimy factor.

00:11:00.570 --> 00:11:03.000
You've got the nam prik
pao, the roasted chili jam,

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.270
which is a little bit sweet
and a little bit spicy.

00:11:05.270 --> 00:11:07.020
You've got the sour spicy seafood sauce,

00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:08.870
you've got the garlic and chili,

00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:10.870
you've got the crispy shallots,

00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:12.080
and then finally the herb to kind of

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:13.510
cleanse the mouth at the end.

00:11:13.510 --> 00:11:14.910
Moving on from fresh oysters,

00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:16.330
let's try the oyster omelet,

00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:18.680
and she fried this in quite a lot of oil.

00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:20.290
There's only two eggs
but then she added in

00:11:20.290 --> 00:11:22.010
a bunch of oysters, and then just fried it

00:11:22.010 --> 00:11:25.003
to golden crispy Thai omelet perfection.

00:11:28.363 --> 00:11:30.613
(laughing)

00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:36.260
That was just like melt
in your mouth oysters,

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:40.130
wrapped up in a crunchy egg fluffiness.

00:11:40.130 --> 00:11:42.130
You cannot go wrong, that's delicious.

00:11:42.130 --> 00:11:44.770
Yeah, that would be just
absolutely sensational with rice.

00:11:44.770 --> 00:11:46.970
I have to, so let me
grab a little bit more.

00:11:48.164 --> 00:11:49.130
Oh, the meaty part from the center

00:11:49.130 --> 00:11:51.563
where all the oysters have congregated.

00:11:52.856 --> 00:11:55.800
They do have some sauce
prik which is like a

00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:58.090
chili ketchup-y type
of sauce, but I usually

00:11:58.090 --> 00:11:59.960
like to go for the nam jim
seafood on this as well,

00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:03.143
which is the seafood sauce
with garlic and chilies.

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:09.050
Next we have pla kaphong tod gratiem

00:12:09.050 --> 00:12:10.890
which is a fried barramundi fish.

00:12:10.890 --> 00:12:12.950
You can see the garlic on top,

00:12:12.950 --> 00:12:15.160
I think I'll just go right in.

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:16.660
I gotta add on a little bit of

00:12:18.143 --> 00:12:19.423
the nam jim seafood to this bite.

00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:24.680
Their nam jim seafood is excellent here.

00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:27.220
Nice and sour, you can taste the garlic,

00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:29.133
just a hint of a balance of sweetness.

00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:33.180
One of the local Chanthaburi
dishes is called sen chan,

00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:34.710
which is a fried noodle dish.

00:12:34.710 --> 00:12:36.690
This one is stir fried with crab.

00:12:36.690 --> 00:12:38.610
You can see the red sauce on it.

00:12:38.610 --> 00:12:41.270
There are some chives in there as well.

00:12:41.270 --> 00:12:44.850
And pieces of crab, and
then it's stir fried.

00:12:44.850 --> 00:12:47.243
This is to accompany the seafood feast.

00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:56.905
It's a little bit on the sweet side.

00:12:56.905 --> 00:13:01.400
But it has, I'm not sure,
maybe it's tamarind in there?

00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:04.160
It has kind of a, a little
bit of a fruity flavor.

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:06.230
The noodles themselves
have a really good texture.

00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:08.437
They're kind of gummy,
not like mushy at all.

00:13:08.437 --> 00:13:10.790
You can feel each individual noodle.

00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:13.453
And then of course, you
can pull out bits of crab.

00:13:15.618 --> 00:13:19.630
And this is a, oh yeah,
because of the way it's cooked

00:13:19.630 --> 00:13:23.110
and because it's young
crab, you can eat the shell.

00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:25.980
Next up we've got pla plaa, and this is

00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:27.933
a Chanthaburi specialty again.

00:13:28.950 --> 00:13:30.638
There's fish on the bottom of it,

00:13:30.638 --> 00:13:32.535
but then on the top it's
like a mix of salad,

00:13:32.535 --> 00:13:33.770
there's cabbage, I can
see some lemongrass,

00:13:33.770 --> 00:13:35.280
some shallots, some mint leaves.

00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:37.000
And it's served with a peanut sauce.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.960
And then I think below
there, I think below

00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:42.543
all that mound of vegetables
is some fish, minced up fish.

00:13:52.784 --> 00:13:54.700
It has a little bit of
a ginger taste to it.

00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:57.910
And the lemongrass, the fish
is a little bit sour as well.

00:13:57.910 --> 00:13:59.330
You've got those really refreshing herbs

00:13:59.330 --> 00:14:01.980
and then the peanut
sauce, of course it's like

00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:06.980
full on peanut, plus, it's
sweet and kind of tangy.

00:14:07.090 --> 00:14:09.910
But sweet again, in a
tamarind kind of sweetness,

00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:12.590
like a fruity sweetness.

00:14:12.590 --> 00:14:16.330
Next up for the tom yum goong,
and lots of shrimp in here.

00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:18.850
Lots of mushrooms, this
is what she was making

00:14:18.850 --> 00:14:21.473
as we came to the dock.

00:14:23.872 --> 00:14:25.633
Let's just start with the broth first.

00:14:28.668 --> 00:14:32.293
Oh, it's so soothing.

00:14:33.190 --> 00:14:38.190
It's perfectly sour, it has
the creamy shrimpiness to it.

00:14:38.285 --> 00:14:39.653
Yeah, it's really good.

00:14:43.601 --> 00:14:45.824
(speaking in foreign language)

00:14:45.824 --> 00:14:48.163
(lighthearted synthesizer)

00:14:48.163 --> 00:14:49.140
Few more things still to eat.

00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:51.350
This is just a never
ended, all you can eat

00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:54.570
seafood buffet, okay it is
time for the plate of crabs.

00:14:54.570 --> 00:14:57.750
These are not huge crabs but
they are blue swimmer crabs.

00:14:57.750 --> 00:14:59.080
I'll go for this guy right here,

00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:02.820
and let's see about the
apron, male or female?

00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:05.990
I guess this is a male, cause
you can take that apron,

00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:10.550
you can pull off the head like that.

00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:15.550
Break this guy in half,
and you can also pull

00:15:15.610 --> 00:15:20.420
off the claws, kind of
fully dissect it like that.

00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:23.690
Pull this guy out, kind
of peel that section.

00:15:23.690 --> 00:15:24.970
Okay, I'm not the greatest at this,

00:15:24.970 --> 00:15:26.950
Ying is always better than I am.

00:15:26.950 --> 00:15:31.950
But right under here, we
should have a good nugget.

00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:35.670
Oh yes, there it is, there it is.

00:15:35.670 --> 00:15:37.520
Gotta go in for a little
bit of the seafood sauce

00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:38.513
on this as well.

00:15:40.602 --> 00:15:42.852
(slurping)

00:15:49.150 --> 00:15:51.840
Crab, one of the greatest things ever.

00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:54.560
And with that sauce, it's superb.

00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:57.650
That crab is not big,
there's not a lot of meat,

00:15:57.650 --> 00:16:01.100
but you work for it, and it is so good.

00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:03.920
And on that note, oh there's
still some squid to try.

00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:06.930
But I'm gonna take a little
lean back for a minute.

00:16:06.930 --> 00:16:10.810
Micah had a nice nap
and he's now joined us.

00:16:10.810 --> 00:16:13.370
I think this is the final
seafood dish we have.

00:16:13.370 --> 00:16:16.693
A plate of squid, just slightly boiled.

00:16:20.725 --> 00:16:24.710
Oh yeah, again, just
ultra fresh, it's chewy

00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:26.930
in all the perfect kind of
ways, just a little bit chewy,

00:16:26.930 --> 00:16:28.073
but not overly chewy.

00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:30.123
Just a clean taste.

00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:35.283
That's fantastic squid.

00:16:36.584 --> 00:16:40.167
(lighthearted synthesizer)

00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:48.340
Nam sam brong, taking a little break

00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:50.818
to drink some nam sam brong.

00:16:50.818 --> 00:16:52.394
- Sab rong
- What is it?

00:16:52.394 --> 00:16:54.415
- Sam long.
- Sam long.

00:16:54.415 --> 00:16:56.142
- Okay, so nam sam long,
and Uncle Tom was telling us

00:16:56.142 --> 00:16:57.760
that this is a local drink
that they get from the jungle,

00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:00.160
made from some herb or
something from the jungle,

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:03.140
from right here, that
they get from the village.

00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:04.440
Let's try this.

00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:07.263
I've never heard of it before
in other parts of Thailand.

00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:11.050
Oh wow, it's kind of like jelly-ish.

00:17:11.050 --> 00:17:12.210
It doesn't look like a straight liquid,

00:17:12.210 --> 00:17:14.843
it's kind of like, kind of jelly-y.

00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:20.493
Oh wow.

00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:23.370
Yeah, it is kind jelly-y.

00:17:23.370 --> 00:17:26.790
It kind has kind of like,
kind of like the chia seed

00:17:26.790 --> 00:17:28.823
jelly slimy feel to it.

00:17:34.990 --> 00:17:36.650
That's a drink you
gotta chew a little bit.

00:17:36.650 --> 00:17:38.377
This is just ultimate right now.

00:17:38.377 --> 00:17:43.024
This is gorgeous, the scenery,

00:17:43.024 --> 00:17:46.720
this is indeed once of
the most picturesque,

00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:50.130
most memorable seafood
meals I've ever had.

00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:53.680
Oh, look at that nugget of
crab that just slid out.

00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:55.150
Oh, this needs to be dipped, and I'm at

00:17:55.150 --> 00:17:56.620
the very end of that seafood sauce.

00:17:56.620 --> 00:17:59.780
It was so food, I had
to eat all the sauce.

00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:02.620
But there's still a little
bit left for the scooping,

00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:04.203
for this final nugget.

00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:07.670
I'm gonna mop that up, kinda let it soak

00:18:07.670 --> 00:18:08.870
into that piece of crab.

00:18:09.975 --> 00:18:13.558
(lighthearted synthesizer)

00:18:22.150 --> 00:18:25.073
Oh, that was absolutely phenomenal.

00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:29.730
That was an all-you-can-eat seafood feast

00:18:29.730 --> 00:18:32.993
on a floating bamboo dock.

00:18:34.110 --> 00:18:37.030
That was, yeah, that was phenomenal.

00:18:37.030 --> 00:18:38.550
There's nothing better than just laying

00:18:38.550 --> 00:18:42.660
in a horizontal position
after that much seafood.

00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:45.280
Oh, the sea breeze, and
now we're just kind of

00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:47.113
hanging out with Uncle Tom.

00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:51.150
Uncle Tom and his wife are,

00:18:51.150 --> 00:18:52.160
they're amazing people.

00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:54.070
They're so friendly, they're so nice.

00:18:54.070 --> 00:18:55.823
They will take care of you.

00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:04.317
(speaking in foreign language)

00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:10.223
- (speaking in foreign language)

00:19:14.676 --> 00:19:17.343
(motor revving)

00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:24.160
- Wow, that was gorgeous and
just absolutely fantastic

00:19:24.170 --> 00:19:26.012
while it lasted, from the seafood,

00:19:26.012 --> 00:19:29.710
to the relaxation, to the location,

00:19:29.710 --> 00:19:33.870
to Uncle Tom and his wife
who treat you like family.

00:19:33.870 --> 00:19:35.770
We're on our way back to the mainland.

00:19:37.097 --> 00:19:42.097
(water splashing)
(motor put-putting)

00:19:50.644 --> 00:19:52.274
(speaking in foreign language)

00:19:52.274 --> 00:19:56.622
- (speaking in foreign language)

00:19:56.622 --> 00:19:58.745
(baby babbling)

00:19:58.745 --> 00:20:02.328
(lighthearted synthesizer)

00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:06.973
- No doubt, it was one
of the most memorable

00:20:06.973 --> 00:20:09.520
seafood meals of my life.

00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:11.610
First of all, I have to give it up,

00:20:11.610 --> 00:20:13.690
and I have to say a huge thank you to

00:20:13.690 --> 00:20:16.520
Uncle Tom and his wife, Lum Tom.

00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:18.580
Oh man, they hooked it up.

00:20:18.580 --> 00:20:21.580
They're such nice, they're
such genuine people.

00:20:21.580 --> 00:20:23.730
When you eat there, they make you feel

00:20:23.730 --> 00:20:25.140
like they're part of your family.

00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:28.884
On top of that, you just
don't get any fresher seafood

00:20:28.884 --> 00:20:32.920
than that, and you don't get
a better atmosphere location,

00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:35.660
floating on a houseboat, in the water.

00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:39.230
The entire experience was unbelievable,

00:20:39.230 --> 00:20:40.090
I'll never forget it.

00:20:40.090 --> 00:20:41.550
So that's it for this video.
