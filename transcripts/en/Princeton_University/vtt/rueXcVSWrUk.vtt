00:00:01.848 --> 00:00:04.170
CELESTE NELSON: I'm
inspired by my students.

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.940
I'm inspired by the challenges
that they overcome, the ideas

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.320
that they come up with.

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.030
I'm inspired by my previous
mentors who have not only

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.030
inspired me, but many
generations of scientists

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:19.080
as well.

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.180
I find inspiration from looking
at the variety of organisms

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.370
that we have on
our planet, and how

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:32.890
they achieve their unique forms
and niches that they fill.

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:34.800
I'm Celeste Nelson,
professor of chemical

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.850
and biological engineering.

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.040
My group is focused on trying
to understand how populations

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.370
of cells build the
beautiful structures that we

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.240
see in our bodies and
destroy those during disease.

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.760
So half of the lab
is focused on what

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.540
we call tissue morphogenesis.

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:56.880
That's the process through
which small populations of cells

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.550
build themselves into the
intricate architectures

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.840
that you see in things like
the airways of the lung,

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.620
or the ducts of the
mammary gland, things

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:06.480
that are really complex.

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.190
And the other half
the lab is focused

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.030
on trying to understand how
those structures are destroyed

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.810
during diseases like asthma,
or fibrosis, or cancer

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.970
progression.

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.900
The way I teach is to come
up with a variety of ways

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.970
to explain information to the
entire population of students

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:27.870
that we have.

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:31.080
Some students learn best
listening to lectures

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.480
and taking notes,
while others learn best

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.640
by hands-on projects.

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.730
The fraction of students
who learn well by doing

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:43.020
is, I think,
increasing over time.

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:49.050
And even those who can grasp
material simply by hearing it,

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:53.250
it's reinforced when they
can apply what they've

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.640
learned to an actual
problem that they get

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.230
to solve with their own hands.

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:03.000
I'm drawn to
beautiful structures

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.590
and compelling images.

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.170
Many of the techniques
that we use in order

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.110
to solve problems or
investigate questions

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.780
related to tissue
development or disease

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.630
are really quite
visual in nature --

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.990
a lot of microscopy,
a lot of imaging.

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:22.590
People in science are,
by nature, quite creative

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.210
and see beauty in the subjects
that they're investigating.

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:30.120
The graduate students
challenge me every day

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.960
to be a better teacher,
a better mentor.

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:39.960
They have an enormous enthusiasm
for conquering the world.

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:43.950
Many come in to research,
excited but a little bit unsure

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.290
of themselves.

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.820
And there's usually a moment
when things just click.

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:53.280
And they realize that they
know enough to come up

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.500
with a new solution
to a problem.

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.000
And seeing them find that
confidence is so much more

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.130
thrilling than any
scientific discovery

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.410
that I have had so
far in my career.

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.860
