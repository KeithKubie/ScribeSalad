[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:08.682
SPEAKER: Please join me in
welcoming Victoria Turk.

00:00:08.682 --> 00:00:10.546
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:11.872 --> 00:00:13.330
VICTORIA TURK:
Thank you very much,

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:16.219
and thank you so much
for everyone for coming.

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:17.240
Thanks for inviting me.

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.690
It's a real pleasure to be here.

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:21.850
I'm Victoria Turk.

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:25.060
I am an editor at
WIRED UK, and I've also

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.900
just written this book,
"Digital Etiquette," which

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.640
is out this week.

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.350
Before I go any
further, I just wanted

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:34.360
to make a quick
confession, which

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.370
is that this is the
very first talk I've

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:37.417
given about this book.

00:00:37.417 --> 00:00:39.250
And in fact, it's pretty
much the first talk

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.740
I've ever given about anything.

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:43.860
So you guys are my guinea pigs.

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.820
And if my knees look
like they're shaking,

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:47.866
it's probably because they are.

00:00:47.866 --> 00:00:50.970
[LAUGHS] But
anyway-- oh, also, it

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:52.720
is the first
PowerPoint presentation

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.780
I've made since high school.

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.458
So I haven't used
any clip art, but I

00:00:58.458 --> 00:01:00.250
might have gotten a
little bit carried away

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:01.575
with the animations.

00:01:01.575 --> 00:01:03.060
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:04.188
It's actually a Keynote.

00:01:04.188 --> 00:01:06.730
Keynote didn't even exist when
I was at high school, I think.

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:08.020
Anyway--

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.380
So what is digital etiquette?

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:15.200
Well, the idea behind this
book was basically a fun,

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.130
modern take on the
traditional etiquette guide

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.655
for digital communications.

00:01:20.655 --> 00:01:22.030
And I think a lot
of people, when

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.000
they think about this term,
"etiquette," it sounds very old

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.370
fashioned and stuffy.

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:30.820
But actually, I think
it's super important.

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:32.560
It is the social
glue that makes it

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.050
possible to communicate
with each other

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:37.420
without accidentally
offending someone.

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.670
And we all do it, whether
we realize or not.

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.810
And I think it's
especially important online

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:46.640
and in digital communications
for several reasons.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.920
Firstly, because most digital
communications are text based.

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.350
That means you're very
limited in terms of the tools

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.637
that you have to get
your point across.

00:01:55.637 --> 00:01:57.220
You've probably all
had that situation

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.250
where you meet someone
only over email,

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.980
and you get the impression that
they're very terse and very

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:05.770
brusque and kind of rude,
because their emails are always

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:06.735
really short.

00:02:06.735 --> 00:02:08.110
But then you meet
them in person,

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.910
and they're absolutely
lovely and really nice.

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.690
So I think for that reason,
digital communications

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.660
can be full of
particular pitfalls

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.700
when it comes to etiquette.

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.610
Also, they're obviously
rarely truly private.

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.550
Even if you think you're
just talking to one person,

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:27.730
your conversation could
easily be shared more widely.

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.440
And they leave a digital trail.

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.950
So that angry email you
send at 3:00 in the morning

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.270
is going to be in
someone else's inbox

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.010
forever once you've sent it.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.600
So this is a saying
you've probably heard.

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.270
"On the internet, no
one knows you're a dog--

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:47.430
but that's no excuse
for poor manners."

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.640
Now, the book covers
four different chapters,

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.800
each of which is dedicated
to a different sphere

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.060
of modern life.

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.750
So there's the
workplace, romance--

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.030
which is obviously a
lot of online dating--

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.455
friendship, and community,
which is social media.

00:03:03.455 --> 00:03:04.830
And it would be
impossible for me

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:08.840
to attempt to cover all
of those here today.

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.050
And given that this is, for
most of you, your place of work,

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:14.010
I thought we'd focus
on the workplace,

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:19.440
and specifically
on how to do email.

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.230
Now, I do realize
the absolute conceit

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.330
of me coming into
Google and trying

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.520
to tell you how to do email.

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:29.190
But the last I checked, you
don't have a Chief Etiquette

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:30.000
Officer.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.220
So maybe I can bring up one
or two points that are of use.

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.160
And actually, just to see
what I'm dealing with,

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.980
let's start with
a quick question.

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.650
Let's talk about
email sign-offs.

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.400
I want you to think about
your default email sign-off--

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.520
the one you use 90% of the time.

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:53.280
You type it without
even thinking.

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:54.405
Who uses "best wishes"?

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:58.430
Someone over there.

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:00.500
Anyone use "best"
or "all the best"?

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:01.970
Variations on a theme?

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:02.780
Quite a few.

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:03.880
Great.

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:06.990
Who uses anything else?

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:08.240
OK, it's worse than I thought.

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:10.620
[LAUGHS] Because
you guys are wrong.

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:11.928
[LAUGHS]

00:04:11.928 --> 00:04:13.240
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:16.410
But we'll get to email sign-offs
and the details of actually

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:19.112
writing an email later on.

00:04:19.112 --> 00:04:20.820
First, I want to step
back a bit and just

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:26.190
think about the bigger
picture of email etiquette.

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:30.000
My driving philosophy
behind email etiquette

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.670
comes from one pretty
universal truth.

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:37.570
"Everyone hates email."

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:39.850
Again, maybe not the best
place to be saying this.

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:44.090
[LAUGHS] But I'm sure there's
a few of you out there.

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:45.090
Now, don't get me wrong.

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:48.310
Email is a fantastic innovation.

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:51.120
There's a reason we all
use it and we still use it,

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.340
decades after it was invented.

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.440
It lets us communicate
with people

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.340
on the other side of the
world, in different time zones,

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:03.095
and it's really actually
reshaped workplace culture.

00:05:03.095 --> 00:05:05.220
I don't think it would be
possible to work remotely

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:07.570
if we didn't have email.

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:10.860
So it is a really great
thing, and it is often

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:11.590
very convenient.

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:19.550
However, it's also stressful,
time consuming, annoying,

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:21.680
and it often feels
like it no longer just

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:23.270
helps us to do work--

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:25.280
it actually is work.

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.650
You don't see many job
ads where in the listing,

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:31.340
they put skills required,
"being really good at email."

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:34.910
And yet, I've spent
whole days in my inbox,

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:38.151
just writing and
responding to emails.

00:05:38.151 --> 00:05:42.245
Now, I don't think anyone really
wakes up full of a sense of joy

00:05:42.245 --> 00:05:44.970
at the number of unread
messages they've got

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:46.770
in their inbox in the morning.

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:50.417
I think you probably feel
more of a sense of dread.

00:05:50.417 --> 00:05:52.000
At least, I hope I'm
not the only one.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.542
In fact, I know I'm not the only
one, because there have been

00:05:54.542 --> 00:05:56.100
studies that have shown this.

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:59.320
One of my favorites is
actually a really small study,

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:01.290
but I really liked it,
because they actually

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:04.650
put heart rate monitors on
a bunch of office workers.

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:07.290
And they made them go
about their daily business,

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:10.080
and they tracked
their email usage.

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:13.950
And they found that the
more people spent on email

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:16.740
in a given day, the
more stressed they were,

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:18.570
and the less
productive they felt.

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:22.690
And I think we can probably
all relate to that.

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:25.680
So based on that, given
that email is terrible

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:28.500
and everyone hates
it, the main principle

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:33.520
of good email etiquette is to
reduce it as much as possible.

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:35.490
Every time you
send an email, you

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:40.530
are asking to take up someone
else's time and mental energy.

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:43.770
So obviously, that means
you should only send emails

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:45.130
when you actually need to.

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:47.130
But when you do, you
also want to make sure

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:50.190
that you are making it as easy
as possible for your recipient

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:51.133
to deal with.

00:06:51.133 --> 00:06:53.550
You want to make sure you're
including all the information

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:57.110
the first time round, so you're
sending one email and not 10.

00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:59.350
And you just want to
make it very clear.

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:01.770
You want to be
concise and precise.

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:03.450
Take up as little
time as possible,

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:06.570
and make it as easy to
deal with as possible.

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:09.000
And often, the best
email is actually

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.540
the one you don't send.

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:17.650
So that said, sometimes
you do need to email.

00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:21.190
Sometimes it is a good thing.

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:23.770
An email has become,
for many workplaces,

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:25.810
the default means of
communicating-- certainly

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:27.670
in office space workplaces.

00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:31.630
That is changing a bit, at least
for internal communications.

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:34.090
I know a lot of offices
use instant messaging tools

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:35.040
like Slack.

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:37.798
I'm sure you guys probably
use Google Hangouts.

00:07:37.798 --> 00:07:38.840
I'm getting lots of nods.

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:39.340
Yep.

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:40.349
[LAUGHS]

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:44.530
But certainly for external
communications, and still a lot

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:47.590
of internal communications,
email is king.

00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:50.980
It's the thing you just
automatically go to first.

00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:56.410
But maybe you shouldn't always,
because the very same things

00:07:56.410 --> 00:07:59.260
that make email really
good for some things

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.700
make it really bad for others.

00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:03.450
So what is email good for?

00:08:03.450 --> 00:08:05.210
It's good for
distributing information,

00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:07.210
especially if you need
to send a message to lots

00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:09.910
of people at once, especially
if it's quite a long message.

00:08:09.910 --> 00:08:11.470
Maybe you need to
attach documents.

00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:13.210
Perfect.

00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:15.100
Simple back-and-forths.

00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:17.740
Keep it very simple,
but if you want

00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:20.740
to have a quick question-answer,
question-answer with someone,

00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:23.032
it can work.

00:08:23.032 --> 00:08:25.240
If you have too many people
on a thread or the thread

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:28.700
goes on for too long, it can
very quickly get confused.

00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:30.790
So simple is key.

00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:32.669
Starting a paper trail.

00:08:32.669 --> 00:08:34.840
I think this is
particularly important

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:37.090
if you're working on a
project that you know is going

00:08:37.090 --> 00:08:39.610
to take quite a long time.

00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:41.080
One really good
thing about email

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:43.270
is it's really easy to search.

00:08:43.270 --> 00:08:47.200
It's not so easy to search
back old instant messages

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:48.768
and things like that.

00:08:48.768 --> 00:08:51.060
But you can find an old email
from days ago, weeks ago,

00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:53.480
months ago, even
years ago very easily.

00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:54.490
So great.

00:08:54.490 --> 00:08:58.860
But more importantly, what
is email not good for?

00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:01.230
It's not good for
immediate responses.

00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:03.310
This is actually a bit
of a controversial one,

00:09:03.310 --> 00:09:05.720
because I think certainly
today, a lot of people

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:09.260
expect immediate responses
or near-immediate responses

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:10.580
from email.

00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:13.130
But going back to the
whole nature of email

00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:15.110
in the first place,
the whole point of it

00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:18.080
is that it is asynchronous.

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:20.840
So you can send an
email at one time,

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:23.120
and your recipient can pick
it up whenever they like.

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:24.370
You could send it one evening.

00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:26.840
They pick it up the
following morning.

00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:31.400
That is one of the
major benefits of email.

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:34.640
We'll get onto how fast
you should be expected

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:38.060
to respond soon, but I
do hold that if you're

00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:40.460
looking for a really
immediate response,

00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:43.030
you shouldn't be
relying on email.

00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:45.190
Discussion and debate--

00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:47.050
I can't emphasize
enough that email is not

00:09:47.050 --> 00:09:49.930
a discursive medium.

00:09:49.930 --> 00:09:53.300
I know the one thing people hate
more than email is meetings.

00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:56.330
But if you have some
kind of problem,

00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:59.800
especially if you need to work
as a group to come together

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:03.550
to create a solution or
come to some conclusion,

00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:07.570
email is just a way to
open the miscommunications

00:10:07.570 --> 00:10:08.810
in that situation.

00:10:08.810 --> 00:10:13.220
So it might be better
just to speak in person.

00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:16.190
And nuance-- I mentioned at
the beginning of the talk,

00:10:16.190 --> 00:10:17.840
the thing about
digital communications

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:20.510
is it can be very hard to
get your meaning across,

00:10:20.510 --> 00:10:24.440
and especially to get any
sense of your emotional meaning

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:25.820
across.

00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:28.520
So if it's a situation
that's a bit sensitive,

00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:30.650
you probably want to be
choosing a format where

00:10:30.650 --> 00:10:33.920
you can use those non-verbal
cues, like tone of voice,

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:36.628
like facial expression,
body language,

00:10:36.628 --> 00:10:38.420
to make sure that you're
not misunderstood.

00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:40.253
And that's not only to
make sure that you're

00:10:40.253 --> 00:10:41.872
coming across the
way you want to,

00:10:41.872 --> 00:10:43.580
but also so you can
pick up on those cues

00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:45.800
from the other person
you're dealing with,

00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:49.400
and maybe tune your
response along the way.

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:55.490
So you've decided that you
do need to send an email

00:10:55.490 --> 00:10:57.790
and that email is
definitely the best medium.

00:10:57.790 --> 00:11:00.620
A key thing around email
etiquette is timing--

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:05.030
when to send an email.

00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:09.910
So obviously, I mentioned
that email is asynchronous,

00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:11.900
and that you
shouldn't be expecting

00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:13.550
an immediate response.

00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:18.830
Expectations have changed hugely
over the past decade because

00:11:18.830 --> 00:11:21.530
of smartphones.

00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:22.910
It's a pretty obvious point.

00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:26.000
It used to be that when you
left the office at night,

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.620
you'd leave your
computer, and you

00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:29.060
wouldn't be expected
to check your email

00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:30.018
until the next morning.

00:11:30.018 --> 00:11:31.340
In fact, you probably couldn't.

00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:33.650
You couldn't even be
tempted to, because you

00:11:33.650 --> 00:11:35.210
had no means of doing so.

00:11:35.210 --> 00:11:37.520
Now, we've come
to expect everyone

00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:40.320
to carry these mini
computers in their pockets,

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:44.930
and we expect them to
to be available 24/7.

00:11:44.930 --> 00:11:48.410
And this has really blurred
the lines between work life

00:11:48.410 --> 00:11:49.730
and personal life.

00:11:49.730 --> 00:11:51.530
To the extent,
actually, that France

00:11:51.530 --> 00:11:56.670
recently brought in a new law
called the [SPEAKING FRENCH]..

00:11:56.670 --> 00:11:59.000
It's the "right to disconnect."

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.720
And it essentially
enshrines in law

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:05.000
your right to ignore your
boss's email on the weekend.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.490
Because they recognize
that work life was just

00:12:07.490 --> 00:12:10.860
impinging on personal
and family life,

00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:13.690
so that workers could
never switch off.

00:12:13.690 --> 00:12:15.440
And I think if you
wouldn't expect someone

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:18.080
to be in the office
that late working,

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:19.790
you shouldn't expect
them to be checking

00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:21.740
their email that late working.

00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:24.870
It takes just as
much effort to do so.

00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:28.010
So I really think
that you should stick

00:12:28.010 --> 00:12:31.530
to work hours or nearabout.

00:12:31.530 --> 00:12:32.660
None of us are perfect.

00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:35.317
Maybe an hour or so either side.

00:12:35.317 --> 00:12:36.650
But try and stick to work hours.

00:12:36.650 --> 00:12:38.960
And try, if you want
to be extra good,

00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:40.860
and stick to your
recipient's work hours,

00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:44.000
especially if they're in
a different time zone.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.210
Now, you might
say, that's great.

00:12:47.210 --> 00:12:50.780
I totally respect my colleague's
right to have a personal life

00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:53.460
and to not check their
emails in the evening.

00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:57.700
But I, the super
conscientious worker--

00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:00.700
I really like sending
emails late at night.

00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:01.900
I actually enjoy it.

00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:05.110
And that way, I'm not
keeping anyone waiting.

00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:07.332
They've got their answer
as soon as they want it,

00:13:07.332 --> 00:13:08.540
and I feel good about myself.

00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:12.620
I can take it off my
to-do list and I'm done.

00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:16.240
The problem is, that goes
back to the original paradox

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:17.170
of email--

00:13:17.170 --> 00:13:19.660
that you were enjoying
the convenience

00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:21.450
of being able to
send it at anytime,

00:13:21.450 --> 00:13:24.970
but you're putting the
stress on your recipient.

00:13:24.970 --> 00:13:27.960
Because even if you don't expect
them to respond immediately,

00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:31.353
they're going to feel
that unread email guilt,

00:13:31.353 --> 00:13:33.520
and they're going to be
unsure about whether they're

00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:35.950
supposed to be replying
right then or not.

00:13:35.950 --> 00:13:39.770
So the onus is on
you as a sender

00:13:39.770 --> 00:13:42.090
to set a reasonable norm.

00:13:42.090 --> 00:13:44.960
And if you really want to be
answering your emails late,

00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:47.510
you can also use the
delay send function,

00:13:47.510 --> 00:13:49.850
so you can just schedule it
to email the next morning.

00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:55.708
Which brings us to, how fast
must you respond to email?

00:13:55.708 --> 00:13:57.250
And this is obviously
the first thing

00:13:57.250 --> 00:14:00.310
that comes up whenever I bring
up the idea of email etiquette

00:14:00.310 --> 00:14:00.947
with people.

00:14:00.947 --> 00:14:02.530
And what's really
funny is that people

00:14:02.530 --> 00:14:04.992
have completely
different views on this.

00:14:04.992 --> 00:14:07.450
And I think this is one of the
main things that contributes

00:14:07.450 --> 00:14:08.908
to email stress in
the first place,

00:14:08.908 --> 00:14:12.190
is that we don't have an
agreed consensus on what

00:14:12.190 --> 00:14:13.430
we're supposed to be doing.

00:14:13.430 --> 00:14:14.950
So we're all just
scrabbling around trying

00:14:14.950 --> 00:14:16.690
to please everyone,
and no one knows what

00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:19.750
they're supposed to be doing.

00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:23.090
Now, it's easy to
say good etiquette is

00:14:23.090 --> 00:14:25.537
to respond to an email
as fast as possible.

00:14:25.537 --> 00:14:27.620
Usually if someone's emailed
to ask you something,

00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:28.703
they want a fast response.

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:34.180
But it obviously is just
so context-dependent.

00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:35.860
It could be something
really simple

00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:37.345
that you can respond
to right away,

00:14:37.345 --> 00:14:39.303
or it could be something
that actually requires

00:14:39.303 --> 00:14:42.580
quite a lot of work, and that
you might not be expected

00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:44.885
to respond for several days.

00:14:44.885 --> 00:14:46.510
So it's a bit of a
cop out answer here.

00:14:46.510 --> 00:14:49.460
There is no "one size fits all."

00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:53.440
But there is a work
around-- a cheat.

00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:54.100
Ask them.

00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:55.561
[LAUGHS]

00:14:56.410 --> 00:14:59.080
I think a lot of people
assume that etiquette

00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:02.500
has to be this unspoken thing--

00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:06.340
a secret code that everyone
else but you knows.

00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:10.150
But I very much pro
being transparent

00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:11.840
and being very practical.

00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:13.630
So if you receive
a message and you

00:15:13.630 --> 00:15:16.180
don't know what you're
expected to do with it,

00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:17.350
just send a quick line back.

00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:18.910
Say, hi.

00:15:18.910 --> 00:15:22.000
Is it OK if I get back
to you in this by Friday?

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.090
Or, hey, this is going
to take me some work.

00:15:25.090 --> 00:15:27.160
When do you need it by?

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:29.280
Easy.

00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:36.020
And fast replies are actually
not always the best etiquette.

00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:38.120
I think a good
example of this is

00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:42.290
if you're on an email which has
been sent to a group of people.

00:15:42.290 --> 00:15:44.940
Say it's been sent
to your whole team.

00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:49.750
I used to be this person who,
at the beginning of my career,

00:15:49.750 --> 00:15:53.460
I really wanted to show how keen
I was, and how ready to work

00:15:53.460 --> 00:15:56.370
and eager I was to get
involved with everything.

00:15:56.370 --> 00:15:58.350
So if our boss
would send an email

00:15:58.350 --> 00:16:00.990
to the whole team
asking for input,

00:16:00.990 --> 00:16:04.200
I'd immediately jump
in with my two cents.

00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:07.500
And I thought I was just
sharing how great I was--

00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:09.090
what a good worker.

00:16:09.090 --> 00:16:12.990
Actually, obviously, I was
just being super annoying.

00:16:12.990 --> 00:16:16.080
I think in that situation,
it's much better etiquette

00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:20.700
to sit back, wait awhile,
see what other people say,

00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:23.020
see if your input
is even needed,

00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:24.770
and if it is, when
you do respond,

00:16:24.770 --> 00:16:27.027
you've then got all the
information that you need.

00:16:27.027 --> 00:16:28.860
And I think not only
is that good etiquette,

00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:30.360
but there's actually
a lot of power

00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:33.150
in being able to do
that, and give one

00:16:33.150 --> 00:16:34.545
very well-informed response.

00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:41.615
"How to write an email."

00:16:41.615 --> 00:16:43.240
I promise I'm not
patronizing you guys.

00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:45.910
[LAUGHS] I honestly think
this is really hard.

00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:49.100
I get it wrong all the time.

00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:52.417
I think everyone
gets it wrong a lot.

00:16:52.417 --> 00:16:54.250
Everything, of course,
goes back to thinking

00:16:54.250 --> 00:16:57.740
about your recipient, and
reducing the burden of email

00:16:57.740 --> 00:16:58.240
on them.

00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:02.770
So precision and concision
are both your friends.

00:17:02.770 --> 00:17:04.720
And this is a quote
from Merlin Mann.

00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:07.089
Does anyone know who he is?

00:17:07.089 --> 00:17:10.119
He's a speaker, a
podcaster, a writer,

00:17:10.119 --> 00:17:13.385
and he coined the
term "inbox zero."

00:17:13.385 --> 00:17:14.760
Have you guys head
of inbox zero?

00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:16.302
OK, quite a lot of
recognition there.

00:17:16.302 --> 00:17:17.200
That's good.

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:19.599
I won't go through
exactly what inbox zero is

00:17:19.599 --> 00:17:21.730
in this presentation,
but it's basically

00:17:21.730 --> 00:17:23.980
a way to stay on
top of your email

00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:27.730
so that you don't drown
in unread messages.

00:17:27.730 --> 00:17:30.960
I'm a huge devotee
to inbox zero.

00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:34.690
Anyway, Merlin was kind enough
to speak to me for this book.

00:17:34.690 --> 00:17:38.720
And this is one thing he
said, which I think really,

00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:42.310
really makes a good point when
you're going to write an email.

00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:44.200
So he says, "Assume
that everyone

00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:46.720
you're communicating
with is smarter than you

00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:50.230
and cares more than you
and is busier than you."

00:17:50.230 --> 00:17:53.170
Sounds kind of obvious, but
I feel like we all almost

00:17:53.170 --> 00:17:55.190
automatically do the opposite.

00:17:55.190 --> 00:17:56.830
You think, this is
really important.

00:17:56.830 --> 00:18:00.080
Why haven't they responded?

00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:05.200
And obviously, it's better to
just consider the other person.

00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:07.170
So writing an email--
let's start from the top.

00:18:07.170 --> 00:18:08.046
Subject lines.

00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:12.840
Pretty simple.

00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:13.735
Keep it descriptive.

00:18:13.735 --> 00:18:15.360
Again, you're trying
to make your email

00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:16.900
super easy to deal with.

00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:20.140
So you need something that
helps people categorize it,

00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:22.672
and so they can see at a glance
what it's going to be about

00:18:22.672 --> 00:18:24.380
and what probably the
adaptations on them

00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:25.540
are going to be.

00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:28.910
I've got a few examples
of how not to do it.

00:18:28.910 --> 00:18:31.410
And I've used a
scenario that I think

00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:35.190
everyone who works in an
office will be familiar with.

00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:36.065
So here's that email.

00:18:36.065 --> 00:18:38.287
"Hi all, Please can
everyone remember

00:18:38.287 --> 00:18:39.870
that if you use a
mug from the kitchen

00:18:39.870 --> 00:18:42.180
it is your responsibility
to wash it up."

00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:44.840
Has anyone ever received
an email like that?

00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:46.300
Yeah.

00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:47.710
Now you'll notice,
in this email,

00:18:47.710 --> 00:18:48.940
there is no subject line.

00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:51.770
The subject line
has been left blank.

00:18:51.770 --> 00:18:52.630
Don't do that.

00:18:52.630 --> 00:18:53.892
It's super annoying.

00:18:53.892 --> 00:18:55.600
When you go to check
your email, you just

00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:57.987
see who it's sent from,
and there's no subject,

00:18:57.987 --> 00:18:59.820
and you immediately
assume the worst, right?

00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:00.695
You're like, oh, god.

00:19:00.695 --> 00:19:02.510
I'm in trouble.

00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:05.850
You could argue you're in
trouble there, but yeah.

00:19:05.850 --> 00:19:08.980
So don't do that.

00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:11.678
Don't put the whole message
in the subject line.

00:19:11.678 --> 00:19:12.720
I've seen people do this.

00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:15.630
I often see, actually,
quite senior people

00:19:15.630 --> 00:19:17.540
have a habit of doing this.

00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:19.290
And again, it's super
annoying, especially

00:19:19.290 --> 00:19:21.060
if you check your
email on mobile.

00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:22.920
You only get the
first few words.

00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:25.087
It's like, what am I supposed
to be doing with that?

00:19:27.860 --> 00:19:29.160
The click bait headline.

00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:31.052
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:33.890 --> 00:19:36.000
Yeah, I've seen quite a
few of these in my time,

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.720
usually from PRs trying
to get my attention.

00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:41.290
Yeah, obviously it's
just misleading.

00:19:41.290 --> 00:19:42.748
It's not very useful.

00:19:42.748 --> 00:19:44.790
And you probably think
you're being really funny,

00:19:44.790 --> 00:19:45.420
but you're not.

00:19:48.498 --> 00:19:49.440
Oh, here.

00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:51.485
URGENT-- kitchen mess.

00:19:51.485 --> 00:19:52.650
[LAUGHS]

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.600
Yeah, so it's OK to play the
urgent card every now and then,

00:19:57.600 --> 00:20:00.820
if it truly is urgent-- if
you need a fast response.

00:20:00.820 --> 00:20:04.003
But every time you play that
card, you are devaluing it.

00:20:04.003 --> 00:20:05.670
I don't think many
people would consider

00:20:05.670 --> 00:20:08.310
this an actual emergency.

00:20:08.310 --> 00:20:10.520
So be very judicious
with "urgent."

00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:13.620
I'm going back to the whole
point of email etiquette

00:20:13.620 --> 00:20:14.130
as well.

00:20:14.130 --> 00:20:16.145
If it wasn't at least a
bit important, (HUSHED)

00:20:16.145 --> 00:20:17.520
you probably
shouldn't be sending

00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:19.370
the email in the first place.

00:20:19.370 --> 00:20:23.580
(NORMALLY) So yeah-- so
this is what I've gone for--

00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:25.650
kitchen mess.

00:20:25.650 --> 00:20:28.680
Yeah, it's totally
boring, completely bland,

00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:30.360
and therefore,
absolutely perfect

00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:31.740
for a professional situation.

00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:38.790
Subject lines-- how
to start the email.

00:20:38.790 --> 00:20:43.960
This is pretty easy, so I
won't spend too long on that.

00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:46.660
You don't need to greet
someone every time, especially

00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:49.240
if you have a
back-and-forth thread.

00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:51.450
So obviously, you
might first say hi.

00:20:51.450 --> 00:20:53.450
But it's like if you were
having a conversation.

00:20:53.450 --> 00:20:55.720
If you're having a quick
back-and-forth email thread,

00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:57.800
you wouldn't say "Hi.

00:20:57.800 --> 00:20:58.490
How are you?"

00:20:58.490 --> 00:20:58.990
"Hi.

00:20:58.990 --> 00:20:59.750
I'm great."

00:20:59.750 --> 00:21:00.250
"Hi.

00:21:00.250 --> 00:21:01.170
That's good."

00:21:01.170 --> 00:21:01.670
"Hi.

00:21:01.670 --> 00:21:02.810
And what about yourself?"

00:21:02.810 --> 00:21:03.310
"Hi.

00:21:03.310 --> 00:21:03.810
Yeah.

00:21:03.810 --> 00:21:04.960
Good too, thanks."

00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:05.890
You just wouldn't do
that, and you don't

00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:07.182
have to do it on email, either.

00:21:07.182 --> 00:21:09.840
Once you've established the
back-and-forth conversation,

00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:11.800
fine to omit it.

00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:15.790
I usually just, as a rule of
thumb, if a day has passed,

00:21:15.790 --> 00:21:20.830
so you slept on it, I'll
then do a greeting again.

00:21:20.830 --> 00:21:25.050
"Dear Someone" is not
usually necessary,

00:21:25.050 --> 00:21:29.220
unless the email is taking
the place of a formal letter.

00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:32.310
So if it's a cover letter
for a job application

00:21:32.310 --> 00:21:34.920
or an official
invitation of some sort,

00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:36.840
then you might
want to use "dear."

00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:37.980
It's 2019.

00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:40.320
You can probably use
someone's first name.

00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:42.180
The exception I
make is if they have

00:21:42.180 --> 00:21:45.620
a title that is
not Ms., Mr., Miss,

00:21:45.620 --> 00:21:50.790
Mrs. So if it's something like
Doctor, Professor, Lord, Lady,

00:21:50.790 --> 00:21:53.970
Madame, Sir, I would use the
title the first time round,

00:21:53.970 --> 00:21:56.682
just because some people
are quite picky about that.

00:21:56.682 --> 00:21:58.140
And then when they
respond, they'll

00:21:58.140 --> 00:21:59.902
probably sign off
with their first name.

00:21:59.902 --> 00:22:01.110
You're on a first-name basis.

00:22:01.110 --> 00:22:01.980
That's fine.

00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:04.860
But "dear" not
usually necessary.

00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:05.910
"Hi" is probably fine.

00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:12.320
Striking the right tone--

00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:15.260
I mentioned several
times already that this

00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:20.960
is truly difficult. Email is
terrible for communicating

00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:22.130
emotion.

00:22:22.130 --> 00:22:26.480
For this reason, I actually am
totally pro things like emoji,

00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:29.000
using lots of
exclamation marks--

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:34.040
whatever it is that helps you to
express your emotional meaning

00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:36.380
and get your view
across more clearly,

00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:38.240
I think is totally fine.

00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:41.420
Obviously, that's going to be a
bit dependent on where you work

00:22:41.420 --> 00:22:43.220
and what your position is.

00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:47.900
If you're a lawyer, smiley
faces might not be appropriate.

00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:52.790
But in the media world,
usually totally fine.

00:22:52.790 --> 00:22:58.993
So anything that you can do
to be clear is a good thing.

00:22:58.993 --> 00:23:00.410
And again, striking
the right tone

00:23:00.410 --> 00:23:03.470
is going to depend
a lot on context.

00:23:03.470 --> 00:23:06.560
So you do have to make a
lot of judgment calls there.

00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:09.560
But there are a few
stereotypical ways that people

00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:11.487
email that I've observed.

00:23:11.487 --> 00:23:13.070
And I think that
everyone in this room

00:23:13.070 --> 00:23:14.960
will probably be
able to recognize

00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:18.860
at least one person they
know who does each of these.

00:23:18.860 --> 00:23:22.080
The boss emailer.

00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:25.780
So this is the concept
of emailing like a CEO.

00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:27.890
And Katie Notopoulos--

00:23:27.890 --> 00:23:29.700
American digital journalist.

00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:32.990
She wrote this great piece
about "emailing like a CEO."

00:23:32.990 --> 00:23:34.580
What is that?

00:23:34.580 --> 00:23:37.490
It's when you respond right
away, but just with one or two

00:23:37.490 --> 00:23:38.270
words.

00:23:38.270 --> 00:23:41.120
Like just, "OK."

00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:43.940
And she noticed that
her boss did this,

00:23:43.940 --> 00:23:47.330
and it's also a thing
that a lot of tech CEOs

00:23:47.330 --> 00:23:48.440
are quite well known for.

00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:50.960
You probably know
Amazon's Jeff Bezos.

00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:54.380
He's renowned for
forwarding emails

00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:58.280
from customers to Amazon staff
with not even a word-- just

00:23:58.280 --> 00:23:59.360
a character.

00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:00.980
A question mark.

00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:02.300
Can you imagine receiving that?

00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:04.090
The horror.

00:24:04.090 --> 00:24:07.820
[LAUGHS] So yeah,
emailing like a CEO.

00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:10.610
I spoke to Katie about this,
because she did an experiment

00:24:10.610 --> 00:24:12.830
where she tried it for a week.

00:24:12.830 --> 00:24:14.660
And she said it was
actually really great.

00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:17.030
It made her feel so
much more productive.

00:24:17.030 --> 00:24:19.410
She really stayed
on top of things.

00:24:19.410 --> 00:24:21.530
And she told me,
she'd never realized

00:24:21.530 --> 00:24:26.480
before how much email hung over
her like a little black cloud.

00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:30.150
So it definitely
has its advantages.

00:24:30.150 --> 00:24:33.830
It helps you be able to
maintain your inbox zero,

00:24:33.830 --> 00:24:36.170
if that's what you're
working towards.

00:24:36.170 --> 00:24:38.090
But you have to
exercise caution,

00:24:38.090 --> 00:24:41.900
because there's a very fine line
between being concise and being

00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:46.040
brusque, and being
brusque and being rude.

00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:49.437
So it's a really
difficult one to judge.

00:24:49.437 --> 00:24:51.020
And there's a certain
thing to be said

00:24:51.020 --> 00:24:53.240
about who is able to do this.

00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:55.970
It's called "emailing
like a CEO,"

00:24:55.970 --> 00:25:00.010
and it tends to be people in
senior positions who do it.

00:25:00.010 --> 00:25:01.965
And when you get higher
up the pecking order,

00:25:01.965 --> 00:25:03.340
maybe you have a
bit more license

00:25:03.340 --> 00:25:05.920
to actually just be a bit rude.

00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:09.550
So it really depends where you
are on whether you can get away

00:25:09.550 --> 00:25:11.000
with it or not.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:14.530
And if you work in something
like customer relations or HR,

00:25:14.530 --> 00:25:16.030
there's a certain
expectation on you

00:25:16.030 --> 00:25:19.930
that you have to be a bit more
gentle in your email tone.

00:25:19.930 --> 00:25:24.190
So that's the boss emailer.

00:25:24.190 --> 00:25:25.980
The corporate jargon waffler.

00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:29.010
This is almost the opposite
of the boss emailer,

00:25:29.010 --> 00:25:31.680
yet they have the
same aspirations.

00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:35.640
So this is someone
who sees every email

00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:40.850
as an official missive
to be carefully crafted.

00:25:40.850 --> 00:25:43.140
They probably read a
lot of business books,

00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:44.670
and they're always
into the latest

00:25:44.670 --> 00:25:48.000
trends in thought leadership,
and they try and use that

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:49.570
in their writing.

00:25:49.570 --> 00:25:53.688
So they end up with things
like this sort of stuff.

00:25:53.688 --> 00:25:55.230
You can probably
tell from this, I've

00:25:55.230 --> 00:25:57.747
never actually worked in a
really corporate environment.

00:25:57.747 --> 00:25:59.580
But my partner who's a
management consultant

00:25:59.580 --> 00:26:02.482
tells me that it is
not that far off.

00:26:02.482 --> 00:26:04.440
So yeah, you've probably
all received something

00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:05.815
like that, which
means obviously,

00:26:05.815 --> 00:26:07.140
absolutely nothing at all.

00:26:07.140 --> 00:26:09.810
Definitely one to avoid.

00:26:09.810 --> 00:26:11.720
Third type of emailer--

00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:15.330
[LAUGHS] I couldn't think
of a name for this one,

00:26:15.330 --> 00:26:17.810
and that's the best thing
I could come up with

00:26:17.810 --> 00:26:19.950
to describe it.

00:26:19.950 --> 00:26:23.755
And I now realize obviously,
that headline right

00:26:23.755 --> 00:26:25.130
next to me, and
probably everyone

00:26:25.130 --> 00:26:28.038
could just take a picture
and put it on social media.

00:26:28.038 --> 00:26:30.330
But that would obviously be
terrible digital etiquette,

00:26:30.330 --> 00:26:32.750
so I'm sure you
wouldn't do that.

00:26:32.750 --> 00:26:35.660
But yeah, so this I think
is actually really--

00:26:35.660 --> 00:26:37.260
it's a big phenomenon.

00:26:37.260 --> 00:26:39.380
And I think I have
definitely been guilty

00:26:39.380 --> 00:26:40.520
of this in the past.

00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:43.700
I'm sure I will be guilty
of doing it in the future.

00:26:43.700 --> 00:26:46.290
I think it's actually
a very British thing

00:26:46.290 --> 00:26:49.690
where, especially if
you get a little bit

00:26:49.690 --> 00:26:54.760
annoyed or a little bit worked
up, instead of being rude,

00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:59.050
you go overly formal in a
way that looks ostensibly

00:26:59.050 --> 00:27:03.110
polite, but is actually just
super passive-aggressive.

00:27:03.110 --> 00:27:05.680
So instead of saying
something like, "can you

00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:07.240
get back to me soon?"

00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:08.920
Perfectly normal and acceptable.

00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:12.022
You'd say something like, "I
would be much obliged if you

00:27:12.022 --> 00:27:14.230
could kindly respond to this
message at your earliest

00:27:14.230 --> 00:27:16.860
convenience."

00:27:16.860 --> 00:27:18.330
Yeah.

00:27:18.330 --> 00:27:20.760
Has anyone ever done that?

00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:21.260
Yeah.

00:27:21.260 --> 00:27:23.780
We've got a few people
confessing that one.

00:27:23.780 --> 00:27:25.530
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:25.530 --> 00:27:28.550
So that's another
one to be aware of.

00:27:28.550 --> 00:27:31.430
Before we move on, a few
common email translations.

00:27:31.430 --> 00:27:34.340
I find it really funny that
we will have these set phrases

00:27:34.340 --> 00:27:36.830
that we seem to use in email,
and we wouldn't consider

00:27:36.830 --> 00:27:38.667
saying them anywhere else.

00:27:38.667 --> 00:27:40.250
It's just that kind
of email language.

00:27:40.250 --> 00:27:41.625
And I think it's
especially funny

00:27:41.625 --> 00:27:45.230
when I see the Gmail
suggested automated responses,

00:27:45.230 --> 00:27:47.450
because they're
always so spot on.

00:27:47.450 --> 00:27:50.820
Because we all already
just email like robots.

00:27:50.820 --> 00:27:53.690
So we'll just through for a few.

00:27:53.690 --> 00:27:57.008
"Apologies for the
delayed response."

00:27:57.008 --> 00:27:59.300
Yeah, it's just the law that
you have to start messages

00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:00.230
with that, I think.

00:28:00.230 --> 00:28:01.460
I've tried not to.

00:28:01.460 --> 00:28:05.000
My hands just do it.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:05.810
"Hope you're well!"

00:28:08.490 --> 00:28:10.952
Yeah, there's really no need
to ask after someone's health,

00:28:10.952 --> 00:28:12.660
unless you have a
reason to be concerned.

00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:15.480
We all know this is inauthentic,
and you don't actually

00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:17.762
want to know.

00:28:17.762 --> 00:28:19.345
"Not sure if you saw
my last message."

00:28:19.345 --> 00:28:20.574
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:21.780
Yeah.

00:28:21.780 --> 00:28:25.000
You definitely saw
my last message.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:29.140
Obviously, what you mean with
that is hey, why haven't you

00:28:29.140 --> 00:28:30.202
responded?

00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:36.080
"Just following up."

00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:39.400
Yeah, we're always "just
following up," aren't we?

00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:41.410
No. you're never
just following up.

00:28:41.410 --> 00:28:44.980
If you're just following up,
why are you sending the email?

00:28:44.980 --> 00:28:47.245
Just ask the question that
you need to be answered.

00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:51.772
"Does that make sense?"

00:28:51.772 --> 00:28:53.620
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:53.620 --> 00:28:54.780
Of course it makes sense.

00:28:54.780 --> 00:28:57.197
You wouldn't be sending the
email if it didn't make sense.

00:28:57.197 --> 00:29:01.707
If you would, you need to go
back and start redrafting.

00:29:01.707 --> 00:29:02.540
"Thanks in advance."

00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:09.410
I'm going to talk about
thanks in advance a bit more

00:29:09.410 --> 00:29:11.046
in the next slide.

00:29:11.046 --> 00:29:13.045
But yeah, obviously it's the--

00:29:13.045 --> 00:29:15.170
again, going back to that
passive-aggressive thing.

00:29:15.170 --> 00:29:19.820
It doesn't really mean what
it seems to on the surface.

00:29:19.820 --> 00:29:25.700
So back to what I asked at the
beginning and email sign-offs.

00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:28.040
These are the ones I'll accept.

00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:30.650
Basically, "best wishes"
or any variations on them.

00:29:30.650 --> 00:29:33.800
Why do I think they're
a good email sign-off?

00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:35.960
They're inoffensive.

00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:41.540
They're formal enough
without being overly formal.

00:29:41.540 --> 00:29:43.430
They're totally
boring, again, which

00:29:43.430 --> 00:29:47.660
makes them just perfect
for at least 90%

00:29:47.660 --> 00:29:49.520
of workplace communications.

00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:52.700
You're not going to offend
anyone with the "best wishes."

00:29:52.700 --> 00:29:55.004
What do I not like?

00:29:55.004 --> 00:29:56.013
AUDIENCE: Ooh.

00:29:56.013 --> 00:29:57.680
VICTORIA TURK: Has
anyone seen that one?

00:29:57.680 --> 00:29:59.060
I've seen that in the wild.

00:29:59.060 --> 00:30:04.010
[LAUGHS] You've obviously taken
a perfectly good sign-off,

00:30:04.010 --> 00:30:08.360
"best wishes," and turned it
into an utter abomination.

00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:09.232
"Kind regards."

00:30:09.232 --> 00:30:10.440
A lot of people use this one.

00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:11.732
Does anyone use "kind regards?"

00:30:11.732 --> 00:30:12.610
You can admit it.

00:30:12.610 --> 00:30:13.190
We've got one over there.

00:30:13.190 --> 00:30:13.690
Yeah.

00:30:13.690 --> 00:30:14.730
Yeah, we've got a few.

00:30:14.730 --> 00:30:15.910
It's fine.

00:30:15.910 --> 00:30:17.140
It's probably OK.

00:30:17.140 --> 00:30:17.640
I

00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:22.500
Just think it's a bit overly
formal for most situations

00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:24.400
in the modern workplace.

00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:28.830
And I think when you do that
and you go a bit too formal,

00:30:28.830 --> 00:30:32.060
it can come off as
standoffish and a bit stuffy.

00:30:32.060 --> 00:30:34.140
And it's maybe not
giving the impression

00:30:34.140 --> 00:30:37.750
that you quite want to give.

00:30:37.750 --> 00:30:38.893
"Cheers."

00:30:38.893 --> 00:30:40.810
I use "cheers" all the
time with my colleagues

00:30:40.810 --> 00:30:42.400
that I'm also
friends with, and I

00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:44.660
think that's fine in
an informal situation.

00:30:44.660 --> 00:30:47.600
But as your default sign-off,
it's probably not appropriate.

00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:49.000
It's a little bit too informal.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:52.640
So it's just striking
that balance.

00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:54.197
"Thanks in advance" again.

00:30:54.197 --> 00:30:56.030
This is-- and I've saved
the worst for last,

00:30:56.030 --> 00:30:58.280
because I really hate
"thanks in advance."

00:30:58.280 --> 00:31:00.470
Why do I hate it so much?

00:31:00.470 --> 00:31:03.480
Because it's-- [EXHALING] sorry.

00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:04.940
Just let me gather my thoughts.

00:31:04.940 --> 00:31:05.440
OK.

00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:09.650
So it's just so presumptuous,
because that's not

00:31:09.650 --> 00:31:11.510
how gratitude works.

00:31:11.510 --> 00:31:13.160
You don't thank
someone before they've

00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:15.590
agreed to do something, right?

00:31:15.590 --> 00:31:17.240
It's just saying, oh, yeah.

00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:20.040
You realize that you have no
way of getting out of this?

00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:22.490
So yeah, I hate
"thanks in advance."

00:31:22.490 --> 00:31:23.780
Definitely one to avoid.

00:31:23.780 --> 00:31:27.430
Thank someone after
doing something.

00:31:27.430 --> 00:31:28.810
[EXHALING]

00:31:28.810 --> 00:31:29.370
All right.

00:31:29.370 --> 00:31:30.990
So email sign-offs.

00:31:35.790 --> 00:31:36.290
Great.

00:31:36.290 --> 00:31:37.665
So we've gone
through pretty much

00:31:37.665 --> 00:31:39.920
all the main parts
of doing an email,

00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:43.130
so you're ready to send it.

00:31:43.130 --> 00:31:46.520
One last thing-- and
actually, I think this is--

00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:51.410
if you take one thing from
this talk, let it be this.

00:31:51.410 --> 00:31:55.445
Let's all agree on
how to use "CC."

00:31:55.445 --> 00:31:56.870
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:56.870 --> 00:31:59.570
I'm serious.

00:31:59.570 --> 00:32:01.120
So when should you
CC on an email?

00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:02.787
So obviously this is
when you're sending

00:32:02.787 --> 00:32:05.740
an email to all recipients.

00:32:05.740 --> 00:32:06.820
It's a very simple rule.

00:32:06.820 --> 00:32:08.920
There is a strict rule for this.

00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:12.160
The "To" field is for primary
recipients of an email who

00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:15.020
are expected to respond.

00:32:15.020 --> 00:32:17.600
The "CC" field is
for people who need

00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:19.550
to see the email
for reference only,

00:32:19.550 --> 00:32:22.230
and who are not
expected to respond.

00:32:22.230 --> 00:32:23.660
Now, I didn't come up with this.

00:32:23.660 --> 00:32:25.490
I'm not reinventing the wheel.

00:32:25.490 --> 00:32:28.310
Do you know the big
old-fashioned etiquette guide,

00:32:28.310 --> 00:32:29.930
"Debrett's"?

00:32:29.930 --> 00:32:32.530
The edition I have at
home, it's got two pages

00:32:32.530 --> 00:32:34.750
in the whole thing
dedicated to the whole

00:32:34.750 --> 00:32:36.460
of digital communications.

00:32:36.460 --> 00:32:39.010
That's about the same as it has
for how to address a bishop.

00:32:39.010 --> 00:32:43.210
But even it includes
this CC rule.

00:32:43.210 --> 00:32:45.670
That's how important it is.

00:32:45.670 --> 00:32:47.960
Why is it useful?

00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:50.500
You're just making very
clear what your expectations

00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:52.300
on your recipients are.

00:32:52.300 --> 00:32:57.370
And so that is again, reducing
the burden of email stress

00:32:57.370 --> 00:32:59.170
on the world.

00:32:59.170 --> 00:33:01.780
If people are on CC, they know
they don't need to respond.

00:33:01.780 --> 00:33:04.630
If they're in the To field,
they know they have to.

00:33:04.630 --> 00:33:08.290
Obviously, the problem
here is that not everyone

00:33:08.290 --> 00:33:11.000
may be aware of this rule.

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.060
So what you can do
to help establish

00:33:13.060 --> 00:33:16.187
good email hygiene is
if you send an email,

00:33:16.187 --> 00:33:17.020
you can just say so.

00:33:17.020 --> 00:33:19.510
You can just put
something like, "To those

00:33:19.510 --> 00:33:21.100
on CC, no need to respond.

00:33:21.100 --> 00:33:24.190
This is just an FYI."

00:33:24.190 --> 00:33:26.770
And then you don't end up
in that awkward situation

00:33:26.770 --> 00:33:31.240
where you've got people who
you just included as a courtesy

00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:34.438
responding and turning it into
this whole thread from hell.

00:33:34.438 --> 00:33:35.980
Actually, that's
another point on CC.

00:33:35.980 --> 00:33:38.800
When should you
include people on CC?

00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:42.820
Obviously the top-level
rule of reducing email--

00:33:42.820 --> 00:33:46.580
means you should only include
people when it's necessary.

00:33:46.580 --> 00:33:53.740
However, people's feelings
trump that productivity.

00:33:53.740 --> 00:33:55.660
So good etiquette means
taking other people

00:33:55.660 --> 00:33:57.380
into consideration.

00:33:57.380 --> 00:33:59.680
So if you're, for
example, emailing

00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:01.750
a whole team of
people, you really

00:34:01.750 --> 00:34:02.890
need to include them all.

00:34:02.890 --> 00:34:05.920
You can't just
include half of them,

00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:09.040
even if not everyone is
on a need-to-know basis.

00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:11.319
So I call that "tossing
a courtesy CC."

00:34:11.319 --> 00:34:14.020
It's like, eh, I'm including
you, even though I don't really

00:34:14.020 --> 00:34:14.610
care.

00:34:14.610 --> 00:34:18.830
But yeah, just so no
one feels left out.

00:34:18.830 --> 00:34:21.790
CC, however isn't
always a courtesy.

00:34:21.790 --> 00:34:23.770
Has anyone ever been
in that position

00:34:23.770 --> 00:34:28.719
where someone emails you to ask
you to do something, or maybe

00:34:28.719 --> 00:34:31.179
even complain about
something you've done,

00:34:31.179 --> 00:34:33.520
and they so thoughtfully
think to CC your boss?

00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:35.250
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:35.250 --> 00:34:36.219
Yeah.

00:34:36.219 --> 00:34:37.399
That's not a courtesy CC.

00:34:37.399 --> 00:34:41.005
[LAUGHS] That should be
avoided at all costs.

00:34:41.005 --> 00:34:42.380
It's not even
passive-aggressive.

00:34:42.380 --> 00:34:44.469
It's just aggressive.

00:34:44.469 --> 00:34:45.909
And the thing is,
if you genuinely

00:34:45.909 --> 00:34:47.443
need to complain
about someone, you

00:34:47.443 --> 00:34:49.610
should be going through the
correct channels, right?

00:34:49.610 --> 00:34:54.909
You shouldn't be doing the
snide CC your superiors.

00:34:54.909 --> 00:34:55.940
It's like blackmail.

00:34:55.940 --> 00:34:58.600
It's like saying, if you
don't respond to this email

00:34:58.600 --> 00:35:01.880
how I want you to, you're
going to be in trouble.

00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:04.190
So don't do that.

00:35:04.190 --> 00:35:08.210
Now, there is, of course,
an alternative to CC--

00:35:08.210 --> 00:35:09.690
BCC.

00:35:09.690 --> 00:35:13.190
It stands for "blind carbon
copy," as you all know.

00:35:13.190 --> 00:35:16.250
So if you send an
email to someone

00:35:16.250 --> 00:35:18.890
and include someone on BCC,
your original recipient

00:35:18.890 --> 00:35:22.850
can't tell that anyone else
is privy to that conversation.

00:35:22.850 --> 00:35:25.430
That means it can be
incredibly sneaky.

00:35:25.430 --> 00:35:29.560
And for that reason, it's
usually very poor etiquette.

00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:31.740
And "Debrett's" actually
covers this as well.

00:35:31.740 --> 00:35:34.010
It says, if you
need to loop someone

00:35:34.010 --> 00:35:37.040
in on an email conversation
confidentially,

00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:39.440
you should forward
the email to them

00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:42.110
with a note explaining
why it's confidential.

00:35:42.110 --> 00:35:44.570
That way you don't get in one
of those awkward situations

00:35:44.570 --> 00:35:45.987
where someone
doesn't realize they

00:35:45.987 --> 00:35:50.550
were on BCC and not CC,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:35:50.550 --> 00:35:52.670
But there are a few
situations where

00:35:52.670 --> 00:35:57.900
BCC is not only acceptable,
but very necessary--

00:35:57.900 --> 00:35:59.650
to protect people's identities.

00:35:59.650 --> 00:36:02.310
So if you're emailing
a whole group of people

00:36:02.310 --> 00:36:04.140
and you don't want
to reveal their names

00:36:04.140 --> 00:36:06.120
and their email
addresses to each other,

00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:09.630
email it to yourself,
and everyone else on BCC.

00:36:09.630 --> 00:36:10.710
This is super important.

00:36:10.710 --> 00:36:13.350
Sometimes it can even
be a legal requirement.

00:36:13.350 --> 00:36:17.860
In 2016, there was
a London NHS clinic

00:36:17.860 --> 00:36:21.570
that accidentally revealed the
identity of hundreds of people

00:36:21.570 --> 00:36:24.480
who had used an HIV
clinic, because someone

00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:26.310
forgot to put them on BCC.

00:36:26.310 --> 00:36:28.170
So they were all sent together.

00:36:28.170 --> 00:36:31.290
They were obviously
fined lots for that.

00:36:31.290 --> 00:36:34.440
Hopefully, you guys aren't
doing anything quite as

00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:38.010
sensitive as that, but
it's still useful to use.

00:36:38.010 --> 00:36:39.847
To avoid a
reply-allpocalypse-- do you all

00:36:39.847 --> 00:36:41.805
know what I mean if I
say a reply-allpocalypse?

00:36:41.805 --> 00:36:42.650
AUDIENCE: Definitely.

00:36:42.650 --> 00:36:42.990
VICTORIA TURK: Yeah.

00:36:42.990 --> 00:36:44.460
When someone sent
an email, usually

00:36:44.460 --> 00:36:46.800
to an office mailing
list, and they think

00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:48.160
it's just for their department.

00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:50.580
But it ends up being the
whole office, and also

00:36:50.580 --> 00:36:52.140
all the global offices.

00:36:52.140 --> 00:36:54.150
And someone replies
back and they're like--

00:36:54.150 --> 00:36:57.030
the classic-- "take
me off this thread."

00:36:57.030 --> 00:36:59.970
And then everyone else does, and
you end up with this huge pile

00:36:59.970 --> 00:37:00.780
up.

00:37:00.780 --> 00:37:02.640
So BCC-- if you're
emailing lots of people

00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:05.255
and you want to avoid that,
it can be a useful tool.

00:37:05.255 --> 00:37:06.630
Because all the
people who are on

00:37:06.630 --> 00:37:09.570
BCC are not able to reply all.

00:37:09.570 --> 00:37:11.310
They can only
reply to the person

00:37:11.310 --> 00:37:13.240
who actually sent the email.

00:37:13.240 --> 00:37:15.840
Another example, also
from the NHS, actually,

00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:19.320
which apparently has some work
to do on its email skills.

00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:22.320
They had-- if you think
reply-allpocalypses

00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:24.780
that you've seen
have been bad, they

00:37:24.780 --> 00:37:29.820
had one, also in 2016, that
affected the entirety of NHS

00:37:29.820 --> 00:37:35.430
mail, and it resulted in around
500 million emails being sent,

00:37:35.430 --> 00:37:38.200
because they were all sent to
every other person with an NHS

00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:40.320
email address.

00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:43.674
So yeah, it can be bad.

00:37:43.674 --> 00:37:46.350
"To nobly save
someone else's inbox."

00:37:46.350 --> 00:37:48.720
This is a quite
specific situation,

00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:51.990
but it actually comes
up all the time.

00:37:51.990 --> 00:37:56.040
So this is when someone
emails you and a colleague

00:37:56.040 --> 00:37:58.100
with a request.

00:37:58.100 --> 00:38:00.980
And you say, oh, you know what?

00:38:00.980 --> 00:38:05.150
Actually, I'm better
placed to deal with this.

00:38:05.150 --> 00:38:07.590
No need for my colleague
to be involved.

00:38:07.590 --> 00:38:11.720
So what you should do
is respond to them,

00:38:11.720 --> 00:38:15.830
move your colleague to BCC,
and say in the email something

00:38:15.830 --> 00:38:19.430
to the effect of, hey, I'm
best placed to deal with this.

00:38:19.430 --> 00:38:22.655
Moving Sally to BCC
to save her inbox.

00:38:22.655 --> 00:38:25.250
And that means that Sally
will then no longer receive

00:38:25.250 --> 00:38:27.790
any more emails on the thread.

00:38:27.790 --> 00:38:31.220
So it's the ultimate act of
email self-sacrifice, right?

00:38:31.220 --> 00:38:34.730
You're taking on that
thread and saying, actually,

00:38:34.730 --> 00:38:36.290
you don't need to be involved.

00:38:36.290 --> 00:38:37.680
Don't worry about it.

00:38:37.680 --> 00:38:41.870
So that's a really
good thing to do.

00:38:41.870 --> 00:38:44.000
OK, we're coming to
the end now, because I

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:47.840
think we've covered most
of the major points.

00:38:47.840 --> 00:38:51.650
Oh, just as I was talking about
a reply-allpocalypse and using

00:38:51.650 --> 00:38:55.508
the all-office email
address, I thought I'd end--

00:38:55.508 --> 00:38:57.300
obviously, if you've
been paying attention,

00:38:57.300 --> 00:38:59.150
you should be able
to work out now

00:38:59.150 --> 00:39:01.580
that you should never really
be using an all-office email

00:39:01.580 --> 00:39:04.370
address unless you
really have to.

00:39:04.370 --> 00:39:08.570
The three circumstances under
which it is acceptable--

00:39:08.570 --> 00:39:14.330
a genuine emergency, an official
announcement, and free food.

00:39:14.330 --> 00:39:15.530
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:15.530 --> 00:39:17.030
Now, one of those is a joke.

00:39:17.030 --> 00:39:18.340
Can you tell which one?

00:39:18.340 --> 00:39:19.575
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:19.575 --> 00:39:20.950
VICTORIA TURK:
Genuine emergency.

00:39:20.950 --> 00:39:22.554
You shouldn't be
emailing in a fire.

00:39:22.554 --> 00:39:24.290
[LAUGHS]

00:39:24.290 --> 00:39:26.990
Thank you very much,
everyone, for listening.

00:39:26.990 --> 00:39:28.420
My name's Victoria Turk.

00:39:28.420 --> 00:39:31.408
"Digital Etiquette," the
book, is out this week.

00:39:31.408 --> 00:39:32.950
That's my Twitter
handle, if you want

00:39:32.950 --> 00:39:35.644
to tweet abuse at me later.

00:39:35.644 --> 00:39:40.637
[LAUGHS] And I think we're
going to have some questions.

00:39:40.637 --> 00:39:41.220
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:39:41.220 --> 00:39:42.053
Thank you very much.

00:39:42.053 --> 00:39:43.664
[APPLAUSE]

00:39:47.860 --> 00:39:49.720
So we do have time
for questions.

00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:52.110
Please go to the microphone
in the middle of the room

00:39:52.110 --> 00:39:54.398
so we can all hear you.

00:39:54.398 --> 00:39:57.690
And while you're going there,
I have the first question

00:39:57.690 --> 00:39:58.190
[INAUDIBLE]

00:39:58.190 --> 00:40:00.540
VICTORIA TURK: Sure.

00:40:00.540 --> 00:40:03.880
SPEAKER: You talked about
business email-- work email,

00:40:03.880 --> 00:40:04.730
mostly.

00:40:04.730 --> 00:40:09.270
Do you see any general
difference between work email

00:40:09.270 --> 00:40:12.698
and personal email?

00:40:12.698 --> 00:40:14.490
VICTORIA TURK: I have
to say I don't really

00:40:14.490 --> 00:40:16.890
know that many people who
email in their personal lives

00:40:16.890 --> 00:40:17.640
that much anymore.

00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:19.342
Does anyone here email for fun?

00:40:19.342 --> 00:40:20.670
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:20.670 --> 00:40:21.670
VICTORIA TURK: A couple.

00:40:21.670 --> 00:40:23.700
[LAUGHS] Yeah.

00:40:23.700 --> 00:40:26.910
Obviously, the rules
are very different.

00:40:26.910 --> 00:40:30.210
It all goes back to that context
of how formal you need to be.

00:40:30.210 --> 00:40:32.640
If you're actually genuinely
friends with people,

00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:36.480
you can be a lot
more freely spoken,

00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:40.320
and you don't have to
abide by the rules so much.

00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:42.540
I think the really
interesting thing about email,

00:40:42.540 --> 00:40:45.360
actually, is that it
can take the place

00:40:45.360 --> 00:40:47.220
of several different things.

00:40:47.220 --> 00:40:51.540
It used to be very much used
like a snail mail letter.

00:40:51.540 --> 00:40:55.283
Now it's often used more
like a text message.

00:40:55.283 --> 00:40:56.700
And I think in
your personal life,

00:40:56.700 --> 00:40:59.184
you're probably going to be
doing more of the latter.

00:40:59.184 --> 00:41:01.870
But yeah, use loads of
emojis would be my advice.

00:41:01.870 --> 00:41:03.328
[LAUGHS]

00:41:04.790 --> 00:41:07.700
AUDIENCE: All right, so let's
start with the assumption

00:41:07.700 --> 00:41:09.270
that all the people
in the room now

00:41:09.270 --> 00:41:10.890
are able to draft
the perfect emails,

00:41:10.890 --> 00:41:13.445
and send them at
the right times,

00:41:13.445 --> 00:41:15.510
and we're all going to be good.

00:41:15.510 --> 00:41:20.000
But how do we actually
deal with receiving emails

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:21.330
that are not appropriate?

00:41:21.330 --> 00:41:23.900
How do we actually respond
to the "thanks in advance,"

00:41:23.900 --> 00:41:26.360
the emails sent at night?

00:41:26.360 --> 00:41:29.130
And how do we encourage
people to follow

00:41:29.130 --> 00:41:31.510
the digital etiquette,
without sounding pretentious?

00:41:31.510 --> 00:41:32.620
VICTORIA TURK: That's
a really good question.

00:41:32.620 --> 00:41:34.970
Yeah, obviously it would
be quite poor etiquette

00:41:34.970 --> 00:41:36.350
if you went off
at your colleague

00:41:36.350 --> 00:41:38.698
for using "thanks in advance."

00:41:38.698 --> 00:41:40.490
So there's not much
you can do on that one,

00:41:40.490 --> 00:41:44.360
except for silently enjoy
the feeling of self-worth

00:41:44.360 --> 00:41:47.420
you get from doing it better.

00:41:47.420 --> 00:41:53.420
For email sent at night, I
think workplaces on the whole

00:41:53.420 --> 00:41:56.540
should establish better codes of
conduct when it comes to email.

00:41:56.540 --> 00:41:58.443
It is so often
this thing that is

00:41:58.443 --> 00:42:00.110
assumed that everyone
knows how to do it

00:42:00.110 --> 00:42:01.740
and how to do it correctly.

00:42:01.740 --> 00:42:04.100
And actually,
expectations just vary

00:42:04.100 --> 00:42:06.685
so widely that that's
clearly not the case.

00:42:06.685 --> 00:42:08.060
So I think every
workplace should

00:42:08.060 --> 00:42:12.710
have a standard set of rules
on when you're supposed

00:42:12.710 --> 00:42:14.093
to be emailing and not.

00:42:14.093 --> 00:42:15.260
It's really funny, isn't it?

00:42:15.260 --> 00:42:18.500
Because we all seem to assume,
now that we have smartphones

00:42:18.500 --> 00:42:20.450
and that we are
technically contactable

00:42:20.450 --> 00:42:23.810
most of the time, that we
need to always be on call.

00:42:23.810 --> 00:42:25.490
I'm a culture journalist.

00:42:25.490 --> 00:42:27.080
There's not many
emergencies where

00:42:27.080 --> 00:42:29.120
I'm going to be the
person that someone calls.

00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:31.860
And yet even I'm like, oh
gosh, I've got an email.

00:42:31.860 --> 00:42:34.110
I'd better check
it, just in case.

00:42:34.110 --> 00:42:36.005
I don't think that's
ever been super urgent.

00:42:38.417 --> 00:42:40.250
But it is hard to get
out of that mentality.

00:42:40.250 --> 00:42:43.370
So I do think as
senders, you have to--

00:42:43.370 --> 00:42:45.880
the onus to fix that is on you.

00:42:45.880 --> 00:42:48.970
If you receive it,
obviously, if it's possible,

00:42:48.970 --> 00:42:50.410
just don't answer it.

00:42:50.410 --> 00:42:52.960
I think people get
different expectations

00:42:52.960 --> 00:42:55.420
around different people based
on your behavior as well.

00:42:55.420 --> 00:42:57.820
If they know that you're
going to answer at 11:00 PM,

00:42:57.820 --> 00:42:59.750
because you always
do, they're probably

00:42:59.750 --> 00:43:01.400
going to keep doing that.

00:43:01.400 --> 00:43:04.810
Whereas if you establish that
kind of routine where actually,

00:43:04.810 --> 00:43:08.200
I don't answer my emails
until 8:30 in the morning

00:43:08.200 --> 00:43:10.375
or 9:00 in the
morning, then they

00:43:10.375 --> 00:43:12.250
may end up respecting
that without you having

00:43:12.250 --> 00:43:13.292
to actually say anything.

00:43:16.440 --> 00:43:17.110
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:43:17.110 --> 00:43:17.943
Thanks for the talk.

00:43:17.943 --> 00:43:21.000
So on the subject
of email sign-offs,

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:22.500
one option which
you didn't mention

00:43:22.500 --> 00:43:24.805
is, how about having
no sign-off at all?

00:43:24.805 --> 00:43:25.070
VICTORIA TURK: No sign-off.

00:43:25.070 --> 00:43:26.660
AUDIENCE: That is
something I do sometimes,

00:43:26.660 --> 00:43:28.860
when-- especially replying
to an existing conversation,

00:43:28.860 --> 00:43:29.985
or a colleague I know well.

00:43:29.985 --> 00:43:31.200
So it's faster.

00:43:31.200 --> 00:43:32.347
VICTORIA TURK: Yeah.

00:43:32.347 --> 00:43:34.680
I'd say that's similar to the
greeting at the beginning.

00:43:34.680 --> 00:43:36.638
If you're having a back
and forth with someone,

00:43:36.638 --> 00:43:38.080
you don't need to sign off.

00:43:38.080 --> 00:43:41.640
And I often actually just
sign off with the letter V--

00:43:41.640 --> 00:43:45.300
the first letter of my name.

00:43:45.300 --> 00:43:48.060
And I think in that
context, that's fine.

00:43:48.060 --> 00:43:51.990
The first email you send, I
think you do need to sign off.

00:43:51.990 --> 00:43:53.910
Again, obviously,
if it's a more--

00:43:53.910 --> 00:43:56.137
acting more like a letter
than a text message,

00:43:56.137 --> 00:43:57.220
then you need to sign off.

00:43:57.220 --> 00:43:58.845
But I don't think
there's anything rude

00:43:58.845 --> 00:44:00.630
about having no
sign-off if you're

00:44:00.630 --> 00:44:03.330
treating it like a
back-and-forth conversation.

00:44:03.330 --> 00:44:06.205
I think that's fine.

00:44:06.205 --> 00:44:07.150
AUDIENCE: Hey, thanks.

00:44:07.150 --> 00:44:07.953
Thanks for coming.

00:44:07.953 --> 00:44:10.120
You talked about email in
professional environments.

00:44:10.120 --> 00:44:11.578
I'm sure that in
the book, you also

00:44:11.578 --> 00:44:14.530
talk about personal
relationships, as you said.

00:44:14.530 --> 00:44:16.270
Can we hear your
thoughts on what

00:44:16.270 --> 00:44:18.520
I would call the dictatorship
of the blue tick?

00:44:18.520 --> 00:44:21.390
Like when you send a message,
someone sees that you saw, or--

00:44:21.390 --> 00:44:24.130
VICTORIA TURK: I have such
strong thoughts on this.

00:44:24.130 --> 00:44:25.270
AUDIENCE: --you've watched
someone's story on Instagram,

00:44:25.270 --> 00:44:27.070
and they're like, I know
that you've watched it,

00:44:27.070 --> 00:44:28.237
and you didn't say anything.

00:44:28.237 --> 00:44:29.410
And then it's like, eh.

00:44:29.410 --> 00:44:30.910
What am I supposed
to do [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:30.910 --> 00:44:31.743
VICTORIA TURK: Yeah.

00:44:31.743 --> 00:44:35.380
I'm being left unread
is excruciating, right?

00:44:35.380 --> 00:44:37.900
When you can see someone's
read your WhatsApp,

00:44:37.900 --> 00:44:40.380
and they haven't
bothered to respond.

00:44:40.380 --> 00:44:45.100
And you're like, but you
had time to check it.

00:44:45.100 --> 00:44:46.910
What do I think about that?

00:44:46.910 --> 00:44:49.380
I think you shouldn't
leave people unread.

00:44:49.380 --> 00:44:51.630
I think we probably shouldn't
be so neurotic about it,

00:44:51.630 --> 00:44:53.963
but I don't know
how to fix that.

00:44:53.963 --> 00:44:54.880
I'm terrible for this.

00:44:54.880 --> 00:44:58.360
I read so much into
those little blue ticks.

00:44:58.360 --> 00:45:02.260
So I think-- if I relate
it back to inbox zero,

00:45:02.260 --> 00:45:06.160
which I mentioned earlier, part
of the rules of inbox zero is

00:45:06.160 --> 00:45:08.750
if you check your inbox--

00:45:08.750 --> 00:45:10.960
if you check an email,
you have to have time

00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:12.388
to do something about it.

00:45:12.388 --> 00:45:13.930
There's no point
looking at it if you

00:45:13.930 --> 00:45:15.370
know you're not going to be
able to do anything about it,

00:45:15.370 --> 00:45:17.230
because then you're just going
to have to read it twice,

00:45:17.230 --> 00:45:19.313
and you've doubled the
amount of time spent on it.

00:45:19.313 --> 00:45:22.510
I think it would be good
to apply a similar idea

00:45:22.510 --> 00:45:24.400
to your WhatsApp messages.

00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:28.960
If you're checking them, you
should have time to answer.

00:45:28.960 --> 00:45:32.110
And that way, you don't end
up leaving people unread.

00:45:32.110 --> 00:45:33.740
And again, it could
be the same where,

00:45:33.740 --> 00:45:36.640
if it's someone trying
to organize a dinner

00:45:36.640 --> 00:45:38.230
and asking you lots
of dates, and you

00:45:38.230 --> 00:45:40.855
need to check your calendar, you
can just respond like oh, I'll

00:45:40.855 --> 00:45:42.330
check this later.

00:45:42.330 --> 00:45:45.180
But that way, they at least know
that you've seen their message.

00:45:45.180 --> 00:45:50.920
Because that's the thing about
the blue ticks, is we used to--

00:45:50.920 --> 00:45:54.130
before you had them, someone
could see your message

00:45:54.130 --> 00:45:55.810
and not respond to it.

00:45:55.810 --> 00:45:58.390
But you wouldn't be so bothered
about it, because you just--

00:45:58.390 --> 00:46:00.280
you could invent all
these myths about why

00:46:00.280 --> 00:46:01.620
they hadn't responded.

00:46:01.620 --> 00:46:03.850
Like oh, they haven't
checked their phone.

00:46:03.850 --> 00:46:05.720
Oh, they're probably
really busy.

00:46:05.720 --> 00:46:08.690
Oh, maybe they died in a ditch.

00:46:08.690 --> 00:46:11.122
But when you see
the blue ticks, you

00:46:11.122 --> 00:46:12.830
know they've actually
seen it, and that's

00:46:12.830 --> 00:46:14.516
what's so irritating.

00:46:17.410 --> 00:46:19.160
AUDIENCE: You acknowledged
that most of us

00:46:19.160 --> 00:46:21.320
don't use email for
personal stuff anymore.

00:46:21.320 --> 00:46:23.750
Do you think that's
entirely a good thing?

00:46:23.750 --> 00:46:26.750
Or there's cases, for example,
like planning a holiday

00:46:26.750 --> 00:46:28.220
or something--

00:46:28.220 --> 00:46:31.183
would a WhatsApp group or an
email thread be better to that?

00:46:31.183 --> 00:46:33.100
VICTORIA TURK: That's
an interesting question,

00:46:33.100 --> 00:46:36.050
because I just tried
to plan a holiday

00:46:36.050 --> 00:46:40.470
with my family over WhatsApp,
and we all fell out.

00:46:40.470 --> 00:46:41.960
It was a disaster.

00:46:41.960 --> 00:46:43.540
Would email have been better?

00:46:46.316 --> 00:46:49.860
For something like that where
it involves lots of discussion,

00:46:49.860 --> 00:46:53.850
I think the best thing is
an actual conversation.

00:46:53.850 --> 00:46:56.022
Obviously, that isn't
always possible.

00:46:56.022 --> 00:46:57.480
I suppose the
advantage of email is

00:46:57.480 --> 00:46:59.790
you can include more information
and you can put links

00:46:59.790 --> 00:47:01.380
to stuff and things like that.

00:47:03.910 --> 00:47:05.760
Yeah, I just think--

00:47:05.760 --> 00:47:10.300
I don't even know most my
friend's email addresses.

00:47:10.300 --> 00:47:11.990
So I just think
it's not the kind

00:47:11.990 --> 00:47:15.800
of go-to communication for
those more friendly situations

00:47:15.800 --> 00:47:16.550
these days.

00:47:16.550 --> 00:47:17.360
Maybe it should be.

00:47:17.360 --> 00:47:20.000
Maybe we should
try to revive it.

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:22.040
I think maybe everyone's
so put off email,

00:47:22.040 --> 00:47:26.170
just from work email and
it just being so terrible,

00:47:26.170 --> 00:47:31.262
that I'm loathe to try to bring
that into my private life.

00:47:31.262 --> 00:47:31.970
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:47:34.730 --> 00:47:36.232
SPEAKER: Last chance
for questions.

00:47:39.022 --> 00:47:39.730
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:47:39.730 --> 00:47:40.230
Good talk.

00:47:42.640 --> 00:47:50.680
Having sent email for decades,
and from a very nerdy area,

00:47:50.680 --> 00:47:52.120
the majority of
mails I dealt with

00:47:52.120 --> 00:47:55.960
were reply inline, with the
Chevron indentation moving.

00:47:55.960 --> 00:47:57.250
The thread was easy to follow.

00:47:57.250 --> 00:47:58.333
VICTORIA TURK: Oh, my god.

00:47:58.333 --> 00:47:59.360
[LAUGHS]

00:47:59.360 --> 00:48:01.630
AUDIENCE: Outlook came
along, and the cursor

00:48:01.630 --> 00:48:04.400
flashed at the top, and a
new generation of non-tech

00:48:04.400 --> 00:48:06.430
started just
replying-- top posting.

00:48:06.430 --> 00:48:08.800
And there's a different
style of email arrived.

00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:11.020
And then you can't
mix the two at all.

00:48:11.020 --> 00:48:11.590
Google--

00:48:11.590 --> 00:48:13.628
I thought I'd given up
and the ship had sailed.

00:48:13.628 --> 00:48:14.920
But at Google, it's surprising.

00:48:14.920 --> 00:48:17.680
There's a good 40% mails
on reply inlines list.

00:48:17.680 --> 00:48:19.390
This has still
survived as a thing,

00:48:19.390 --> 00:48:23.160
and I just wanted to know
what your take on that was.

00:48:23.160 --> 00:48:26.143
And how-- should I just give up?

00:48:26.143 --> 00:48:28.060
And I'm just an old-timer,
and I should just--

00:48:28.060 --> 00:48:29.710
or is this really--

00:48:29.710 --> 00:48:31.210
it can lead to quite
a nice thread--

00:48:31.210 --> 00:48:33.210
a very good, easy way to
follow what's going on.

00:48:33.210 --> 00:48:34.600
You're replying
to specific bits.

00:48:34.600 --> 00:48:37.187
Or-- discuss.

00:48:37.187 --> 00:48:38.020
VICTORIA TURK: Yeah.

00:48:38.020 --> 00:48:39.250
That's a really good
point, actually.

00:48:39.250 --> 00:48:41.800
Because that, I think, is when
things can go really wrong,

00:48:41.800 --> 00:48:43.360
is when you mix the two, right?

00:48:43.360 --> 00:48:46.030
And so the thread goes
completely out of control,

00:48:46.030 --> 00:48:48.730
and it's part chronological,
and then it skips something

00:48:48.730 --> 00:48:51.700
and you're like, what?

00:48:51.700 --> 00:48:54.460
I have to say, I think
most people don't even

00:48:54.460 --> 00:48:56.980
think about this, and they
rely on the technology

00:48:56.980 --> 00:48:59.623
to do it for them.

00:48:59.623 --> 00:49:02.290
I don't-- I'm not sure if I have
a particular preference for one

00:49:02.290 --> 00:49:02.832
or the other.

00:49:02.832 --> 00:49:04.745
I think the problem
is if you're mixing.

00:49:04.745 --> 00:49:07.120
So as soon as the thread is
established in a certain way,

00:49:07.120 --> 00:49:09.290
you should just follow suit.

00:49:09.290 --> 00:49:11.690
That's probably the best
answer I have on that one.

00:49:11.690 --> 00:49:12.862
Which do you prefer?

00:49:12.862 --> 00:49:13.570
AUDIENCE: Inline.

00:49:13.570 --> 00:49:13.860
VICTORIA TURK: Inline.

00:49:13.860 --> 00:49:14.360
Yeah.

00:49:17.720 --> 00:49:18.660
SPEAKER: All right.

00:49:18.660 --> 00:49:19.880
We are at the end.

00:49:19.880 --> 00:49:22.010
So once again, thank you
very much, Victoria Turk.

00:49:22.010 --> 00:49:22.910
[APPLAUSE]

00:49:22.910 --> 00:49:24.460
VICTORIA TURK: Thank you.
