00:00:00.415 --> 00:00:02.149
- Good morning, hope you're
having an amazing day.

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:04.530
It's Mark Wiens in Phnom Penh, Cambodia.

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:06.721
And today I'm gonna take
you on a local food tour

00:00:06.721 --> 00:00:08.345
starting with breakfast.

00:00:08.345 --> 00:00:10.049
And then we're gonna have a typical lunch

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:14.282
and then a popular typical
Cambodian Khmer dinner.

00:00:14.282 --> 00:00:16.029
It's gonna be a great day of eating

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:18.249
and I'm gonna show you the typical meals

00:00:18.249 --> 00:00:21.226
in a single day in Phnom Penh.

00:00:21.226 --> 00:00:24.476
(rhythmic funky music)

00:00:27.141 --> 00:00:28.889
It's about 7 a.m. and I'm
starting off this morning

00:00:28.889 --> 00:00:31.026
with what is probably the most popular

00:00:31.026 --> 00:00:34.489
and the most common of all Cambodian Khmer

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:36.513
street food breakfasts.

00:00:36.513 --> 00:00:38.796
And you literally walk
outside of your hotel

00:00:38.796 --> 00:00:40.770
or wherever you're
staying and you can smell

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.184
the aroma of the grills,

00:00:42.184 --> 00:00:45.639
you can smell that fresh
meat in the morning.

00:00:45.639 --> 00:00:47.580
And what they do for this dish is that

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.855
she scoops you a plate of rice.

00:00:49.855 --> 00:00:52.588
It's broken rice,
specifically, it's broken rice.

00:00:52.588 --> 00:00:55.822
And then she tops on a piece of pork.

00:00:55.822 --> 00:00:58.813
And the pork is marinated
in a combination of

00:00:58.813 --> 00:01:02.040
palm sugar and coconut milk
and some other seasonings.

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.337
There might be some soy sauce in there.

00:01:03.337 --> 00:01:05.612
And so it's a very thin piece of pork

00:01:05.612 --> 00:01:07.538
and so it cooks really
well done and really

00:01:07.538 --> 00:01:09.573
almost kind of crispy.

00:01:09.573 --> 00:01:10.552
And you can see that caramelization

00:01:10.552 --> 00:01:13.196
on the edges of the pork.

00:01:13.196 --> 00:01:14.862
And then she puts that over your rice.

00:01:14.862 --> 00:01:17.439
I had to get it with a fried egg as well.

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:19.722
And then this dish is served
with a side of pickles

00:01:19.722 --> 00:01:21.283
and then a side of soup.

00:01:21.283 --> 00:01:25.508
This is a very common breakfast
dish that you will find

00:01:25.508 --> 00:01:26.508
in Cambodia.

00:01:30.374 --> 00:01:31.207
Ooh.

00:01:32.762 --> 00:01:33.818
Oh, it's good.

00:01:33.818 --> 00:01:36.797
And the pork is indeed cooked very well

00:01:36.797 --> 00:01:38.480
so it's a little bit dried out.

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.628
But then with that scoop
of oil that she added on,

00:01:40.628 --> 00:01:42.868
that rehydrates it and that ...

00:01:42.868 --> 00:01:45.454
It's so fragrant, it's so smokey.

00:01:45.454 --> 00:01:47.616
And I think I can taste a
little bit of coconut in there.

00:01:47.616 --> 00:01:49.340
I would have preferred my egg
to be a little bit runnier

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:50.483
but that's okay.

00:01:50.483 --> 00:01:55.402
We've still got a little bit
of a transparent yolk in there.

00:01:55.402 --> 00:01:57.985
And follow that with some soup.

00:01:59.311 --> 00:02:00.144
Mmm.

00:02:01.417 --> 00:02:04.319
Oh, that tastes like a fishy soup.

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:06.480
Oh, that just completes the full meal.

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.406
If there happens to be
a little bit of chili

00:02:08.406 --> 00:02:09.823
on this table ...

00:02:10.955 --> 00:02:13.380
Oh, which, yes there is,

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.485
this would just complete
the full meal deal.

00:02:16.485 --> 00:02:19.069
Add a little bit of
chili on the side here,

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:22.328
or how about right there in the center.

00:02:22.328 --> 00:02:23.161
Oh, yes.

00:02:24.298 --> 00:02:26.968
Again, the same procedure.

00:02:26.968 --> 00:02:29.551
Egg, piece of pork, chili sauce

00:02:31.536 --> 00:02:33.703
and some of those pickles.

00:02:39.248 --> 00:02:40.081
Oh yes.

00:02:41.028 --> 00:02:41.861
Fantastic.

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:48.800
Oh, what a breakfast.

00:02:49.981 --> 00:02:51.731
And follow with soup.

00:02:52.666 --> 00:02:54.315
Really really good in the morning.

00:02:54.315 --> 00:02:55.338
That's a great way to start your day

00:02:55.338 --> 00:02:57.022
when you're in Phnom Penh, Cambodia,

00:02:57.022 --> 00:02:58.350
or anywhere in Cambodia.

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.487
And that's about as local and as popular

00:03:01.487 --> 00:03:03.162
as you can possibly get.

00:03:03.162 --> 00:03:04.364
And you can find it everywhere.

00:03:04.364 --> 00:03:05.941
Literally, just take a walk outside

00:03:05.941 --> 00:03:08.274
and you will find this dish.

00:03:10.232 --> 00:03:13.983
(men speaking in foreign language)

00:03:13.983 --> 00:03:14.816
- Okay.

00:03:14.816 --> 00:03:17.159
(honking)

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:18.813
(laughs)

00:03:18.813 --> 00:03:20.760
- We're just cutting off a giant truck

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.510
and going the opposite
direction on the road.

00:03:26.738 --> 00:03:29.654
And we're going not too far away.

00:03:29.654 --> 00:03:31.961
We're going to the old market.

00:03:31.961 --> 00:03:34.246
And there's a lot of things
to eat for lunch there.

00:03:34.246 --> 00:03:36.667
There should be a good place to grab some

00:03:36.667 --> 00:03:39.910
local, typical, Khmer Cambodian lunch.

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:43.160
(rhythmic funky music)

00:03:48.971 --> 00:03:50.054
Okay, arkoun.

00:03:51.277 --> 00:03:53.017
We made it to this area.

00:03:53.017 --> 00:03:57.472
This is close to Psar Chas,
which is the old market.

00:03:57.472 --> 00:04:02.176
But we're just gonna look
for lunch around this area.

00:04:02.176 --> 00:04:03.946
This is exactly what I was hoping for.

00:04:03.946 --> 00:04:06.184
There is some amazing food at this market.

00:04:06.184 --> 00:04:08.720
Lots and lots of different
grilled river fish

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.019
and some local Khmer delicacies for lunch.

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:13.978
Hello, how are you?

00:04:13.978 --> 00:04:18.145
Look at that selection of
proteins, fried and grilled.

00:04:19.082 --> 00:04:20.398
There's pickles, there's ...

00:04:20.398 --> 00:04:25.297
Oh, I can see the prahok, which
is the fermented fish paste.

00:04:25.297 --> 00:04:27.464
All sorts of grilled fish.

00:04:32.007 --> 00:04:34.610
At this market they
have about ten different

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:37.096
lunch time stalls that all serve

00:04:37.096 --> 00:04:40.623
a beautiful assortment of different food,

00:04:40.623 --> 00:04:42.987
especially lots of different
grilled river fish.

00:04:42.987 --> 00:04:44.606
There's some fried fish as well.

00:04:44.606 --> 00:04:46.963
There's some bubbly stews going on.

00:04:46.963 --> 00:04:50.096
There's some beautiful steamed

00:04:50.096 --> 00:04:52.206
different Cambodian Khmer dishes.

00:04:52.206 --> 00:04:54.758
Some prahok, lots of things going on.

00:04:54.758 --> 00:04:57.302
And then you have the big
pot of rice over here.

00:04:57.302 --> 00:05:01.469
This is truly a spectacular
display of different foods.

00:05:04.009 --> 00:05:05.414
There's so much going on.

00:05:05.414 --> 00:05:08.244
This is where we're gonna
have Khmer lunch today.

00:05:08.244 --> 00:05:10.899
Wow, that is a selection of fish.

00:05:10.899 --> 00:05:14.412
These maybe are Snakehead
fish, which she curls up

00:05:14.412 --> 00:05:16.790
onto a skewer and then they slow roast.

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:18.549
They just sit here on
the grill all afternoon

00:05:18.549 --> 00:05:20.597
and just kind of slow
roast over the coals.

00:05:20.597 --> 00:05:23.644
That looks like a fish
I wanna eat for lunch.

00:05:23.644 --> 00:05:24.777
Okay.

00:05:24.777 --> 00:05:27.460
(woman speaks in foreign language)

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:29.182
Okay, thank you very much.

00:05:29.182 --> 00:05:33.349
(Mark speaks in foreign language)

00:05:42.944 --> 00:05:45.070
This is one of the meals
where you break a sweat

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:47.213
before you even start eating.

00:05:47.213 --> 00:05:48.588
I'm just dripping with sweat.

00:05:48.588 --> 00:05:50.637
And actually, almost
everybody just drives up

00:05:50.637 --> 00:05:52.482
on their motorbikes and gets takeaway.

00:05:52.482 --> 00:05:53.807
But we wanted to sit here and eat

00:05:53.807 --> 00:05:55.592
and so the lady who actually ...

00:05:55.592 --> 00:05:58.333
Her business is right in front of where

00:05:58.333 --> 00:05:59.561
they're selling the food.

00:05:59.561 --> 00:06:02.791
She kindly brought out a
table, a little pop up table

00:06:02.791 --> 00:06:03.987
for us to eat here.

00:06:03.987 --> 00:06:05.457
Really really kind of her.

00:06:05.457 --> 00:06:06.394
Thank you very much.

00:06:06.394 --> 00:06:10.144
And this is some very
local Khmer lunch food.

00:06:12.409 --> 00:06:14.652
And this is a cool place.

00:06:14.652 --> 00:06:16.977
The aunties cooking the food
here are really friendly.

00:06:16.977 --> 00:06:20.069
They were excited that we
ordered all these foods.

00:06:20.069 --> 00:06:24.922
My nose is detecting some
definite fermented fish aromas

00:06:24.922 --> 00:06:26.108
coming off of this table.

00:06:26.108 --> 00:06:27.948
I'm gonna begin with this dish here.

00:06:27.948 --> 00:06:30.809
And this is a type of prahok.

00:06:30.809 --> 00:06:32.077
And it's a fermented ...

00:06:32.077 --> 00:06:36.033
This one is one of the
main fermented fish dishes.

00:06:36.033 --> 00:06:38.429
It's a paste, I can see
some lemongrass in there

00:06:38.429 --> 00:06:39.878
and some herbs and some chilies.

00:06:39.878 --> 00:06:42.024
And then this one they
wrapped in a banana leaf

00:06:42.024 --> 00:06:43.274
and grilled it.

00:06:46.249 --> 00:06:47.082
Oh, wow.

00:06:48.804 --> 00:06:50.244
That's pretty salty.

00:06:50.244 --> 00:06:51.950
That's a great flavor, though.

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:54.169
It does have that
fermented fish aroma to it.

00:06:54.169 --> 00:06:56.184
It's really loaded with lemongrass.

00:06:56.184 --> 00:06:58.646
A little bit of a smokey flavor
from being roasted as well.

00:06:58.646 --> 00:07:01.256
This seems to be one of the most popular

00:07:01.256 --> 00:07:05.166
Khmer Cambodian dishes, a
mixture of minced meat with egg.

00:07:05.166 --> 00:07:06.309
And then kind of ...

00:07:06.309 --> 00:07:07.514
I think this might either steamed or ...

00:07:07.514 --> 00:07:09.276
I think steamed in this little bowl.

00:07:09.276 --> 00:07:11.672
This is a nice little version of it.

00:07:11.672 --> 00:07:13.081
It's almost like a little casserole.

00:07:13.081 --> 00:07:15.088
I'll reach in with my spoon here.

00:07:15.088 --> 00:07:16.321
Oh, the firmness of that.

00:07:16.321 --> 00:07:18.321
Stick this onto my rice.

00:07:21.217 --> 00:07:22.134
Very salty.

00:07:23.964 --> 00:07:27.746
Has like a little bit of a
fermented taste to it, too.

00:07:27.746 --> 00:07:30.526
It almost sort of has
that starchiness of yolk

00:07:30.526 --> 00:07:31.443
in texture.

00:07:32.363 --> 00:07:34.484
And then you can taste
little bits of minced meat

00:07:34.484 --> 00:07:35.418
in there as well.

00:07:35.418 --> 00:07:37.255
This is one of the more
daring looking dishes

00:07:37.255 --> 00:07:39.002
that she's serving for lunch today.

00:07:39.002 --> 00:07:42.925
And it's little fish in
kind of a dark, murky sauce.

00:07:42.925 --> 00:07:44.032
Oh, you can actually see,

00:07:44.032 --> 00:07:45.610
you get in really close there,

00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:48.289
you can actually see
some lime pulp in there.

00:07:48.289 --> 00:07:50.249
And I think that's shreds of ginger.

00:07:50.249 --> 00:07:51.693
I have no idea if these fish are raw

00:07:51.693 --> 00:07:55.860
or if they're cooked, or
if they're just fermented.

00:08:00.783 --> 00:08:01.616
Mmmm.

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:04.172
Oh.

00:08:04.172 --> 00:08:05.566
Wow, okay.

00:08:05.566 --> 00:08:09.617
It's not nearly as bizarre
as I thought it was gonna be.

00:08:09.617 --> 00:08:11.284
It kind of has a ...

00:08:12.698 --> 00:08:15.603
Okay, it's a little bit fishy.

00:08:15.603 --> 00:08:19.871
But it almost has that smokey,
fishy kind of taste to it.

00:08:19.871 --> 00:08:22.902
I was a little bit hesitant
going in with that bite,

00:08:22.902 --> 00:08:24.016
'cause I had no idea what it is

00:08:24.016 --> 00:08:27.819
and it looks pretty hard core fermented.

00:08:27.819 --> 00:08:30.113
But it's actually, the
flavor is wonderful.

00:08:30.113 --> 00:08:32.153
As I keep on chewing, I can
almost taste some cheese

00:08:32.153 --> 00:08:33.534
in there, too.

00:08:33.534 --> 00:08:35.883
Next up to the big fish and you can oh ...

00:08:35.883 --> 00:08:38.102
You lift that skin and
it's just like buttery,

00:08:38.102 --> 00:08:39.882
buttery flesh underneath.

00:08:39.882 --> 00:08:42.717
You can tell that this has
been on the grill for awhile.

00:08:42.717 --> 00:08:43.813
Oh, it's still nice and hot,

00:08:43.813 --> 00:08:47.171
but they do this grilling
style where they grill the fish

00:08:47.171 --> 00:08:49.382
and they just kinda leave
the fish hanging out

00:08:49.382 --> 00:08:51.378
on the edges of the fire.

00:08:51.378 --> 00:08:53.394
So it just kinda slow roasts and keeps hot

00:08:53.394 --> 00:08:56.298
and sort of smokes at the
same time for who knows

00:08:56.298 --> 00:08:57.548
how many hours.

00:09:00.253 --> 00:09:02.782
The actual flesh of the
meat, you can taste that

00:09:02.782 --> 00:09:04.328
it's freshwater.

00:09:04.328 --> 00:09:08.876
And it sort of has that
rubberiness as you keep

00:09:08.876 --> 00:09:10.705
on chewing between your teeth.

00:09:10.705 --> 00:09:13.538
Oh, eat this sauce, with the fish?

00:09:14.615 --> 00:09:15.865
Oh, okay, okay.

00:09:18.558 --> 00:09:19.688
We just failed to order the sauce,

00:09:19.688 --> 00:09:21.793
but luckily, in those little plastic bags,

00:09:21.793 --> 00:09:23.293
this is the sauce.

00:09:24.531 --> 00:09:26.033
This is the sauce.

00:09:26.033 --> 00:09:29.318
Fish, and I'll put this onto my rice.

00:09:29.318 --> 00:09:31.586
And then for this bite, let me go in for

00:09:31.586 --> 00:09:32.715
some of this sauce.

00:09:32.715 --> 00:09:34.316
If you get a really close
up look at the sauce,

00:09:34.316 --> 00:09:36.584
you can see that there's
just crushed nuts in it.

00:09:36.584 --> 00:09:39.167
But that does smell very nutty.

00:09:45.328 --> 00:09:47.343
That makes all the difference.

00:09:47.343 --> 00:09:49.510
That's sour and it's nutty

00:09:51.063 --> 00:09:52.118
and it's like ...

00:09:52.118 --> 00:09:56.137
You can taste lemony,
maybe lemongrass in there.

00:09:56.137 --> 00:09:58.688
And maybe some cilantro as well.

00:09:58.688 --> 00:10:00.192
Oh yeah, that's what it needed.

00:10:00.192 --> 00:10:01.546
That's exactly what it needed.

00:10:01.546 --> 00:10:05.174
The yellow topped minced meat egg dish.

00:10:05.174 --> 00:10:08.749
It's okay, but it's honestly
not my favorite dish.

00:10:08.749 --> 00:10:12.577
However, the prahok dish, grilled, roasted

00:10:12.577 --> 00:10:15.211
in the banana leaf, that
fermented fish dish.

00:10:15.211 --> 00:10:18.681
That one is really a complexity
of flavors that I love.

00:10:18.681 --> 00:10:19.567
That's delicious.

00:10:19.567 --> 00:10:23.150
And that fermented fish
pickle looking dish

00:10:24.597 --> 00:10:28.514
is quite a surprisingly
delicious dish as well.

00:10:30.432 --> 00:10:31.265
Oh yeah.

00:10:31.265 --> 00:10:33.192
We got another fish and
another one of these

00:10:33.192 --> 00:10:34.486
banana leaf wraps.

00:10:34.486 --> 00:10:37.478
They were pretty surprised
and excited that we

00:10:37.478 --> 00:10:40.087
wanted refills on these dishes.

00:10:40.087 --> 00:10:40.920
They're good.

00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:43.312
This is specifically the dish of the meal.

00:10:43.312 --> 00:10:44.229
Oh, arkoun.

00:10:45.159 --> 00:10:47.367
Oh yeah, we just got a
handful of vegetables, too.

00:10:47.367 --> 00:10:51.057
Just the whole cucumbers and winged beans.

00:10:51.057 --> 00:10:54.839
We'll just go ahead and set
that into the bag, I guess.

00:10:54.839 --> 00:10:56.414
Oh yeah.

00:10:56.414 --> 00:10:58.462
And she has some chilies, too.

00:10:58.462 --> 00:10:59.381
I think I can just ...

00:10:59.381 --> 00:11:00.827
I think it's kind of
self-service back there,

00:11:00.827 --> 00:11:04.577
that little piles of
plastic bags back there.

00:11:05.571 --> 00:11:08.375
You can kind of help yourself.

00:11:08.375 --> 00:11:10.080
Oh, thank you, arkoun.

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:10.913
Arkoun.

00:11:10.913 --> 00:11:13.809
I retrieved the final
component of this meal.

00:11:13.809 --> 00:11:16.891
'Kay, let me move in for some
of this fresh banana wrap.

00:11:16.891 --> 00:11:18.712
There's kaffir lime leaves down here, too,

00:11:18.712 --> 00:11:22.366
giving it an extra citrusy aroma
along with that lemongrass.

00:11:22.366 --> 00:11:25.366
This is really a winner of a flavor.

00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:32.658
Okay.

00:11:32.658 --> 00:11:34.820
That's gonna light my mouth
on fire in a few seconds.

00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:37.266
I can already feel that
chili just juicing.

00:11:37.266 --> 00:11:39.907
Oh, the chili's pretty sweet.

00:11:39.907 --> 00:11:41.425
That was one of those
meals where it feels like

00:11:41.425 --> 00:11:43.961
I took a bath after finishing eating.

00:11:43.961 --> 00:11:45.879
That was a sweaty meal.

00:11:45.879 --> 00:11:47.603
That was some really good food,

00:11:47.603 --> 00:11:49.562
some very interesting dishes.

00:11:49.562 --> 00:11:53.715
Some of the dishes were kind
of surprising with flavor.

00:11:53.715 --> 00:11:55.730
Some of the dishes were pretty intense.

00:11:55.730 --> 00:11:58.745
The grilled fish, in
particular, was really good

00:11:58.745 --> 00:12:01.457
along with that pistachio nut sauce.

00:12:01.457 --> 00:12:03.303
It wasn't really pistachio,
but I don't know what it was,

00:12:03.303 --> 00:12:05.165
but it was nutty and green.

00:12:05.165 --> 00:12:07.368
And then, I have to say that

00:12:07.368 --> 00:12:11.380
this prahok, that was one
of the dishes of the meal.

00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:14.829
That dish right there
was a little bit intense,

00:12:14.829 --> 00:12:17.623
but had some surprising flavor.

00:12:17.623 --> 00:12:19.623
That's a little bit of an adventurous one.

00:12:19.623 --> 00:12:22.692
But really, there's quite
a wonderful selection

00:12:22.692 --> 00:12:24.045
of food here.

00:12:24.045 --> 00:12:25.581
These aunties are friendly

00:12:25.581 --> 00:12:29.748
and this is a proper Cambodian
Khmer street food lunch

00:12:31.114 --> 00:12:33.893
in Cambodia, in Phnom Penh.

00:12:33.893 --> 00:12:37.560
(rhythmic electronic music)

00:12:48.393 --> 00:12:49.555
We're back in a tuk tuk again.

00:12:49.555 --> 00:12:51.457
We're gonna head back
home just to hang out

00:12:51.457 --> 00:12:52.839
for a couple hours.

00:12:52.839 --> 00:12:57.325
And then we'll re-emerge again
for Khmer dinner tonight.

00:12:57.325 --> 00:13:00.075
(rain pattering)

00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:08.637
We spent most of the
afternoon inside the house

00:13:08.637 --> 00:13:09.807
and it's a good thing, too,

00:13:09.807 --> 00:13:12.876
because it downpoured
for a couple of hours.

00:13:12.876 --> 00:13:14.657
And now, Phnom Penh is ...

00:13:14.657 --> 00:13:16.862
Our street is flooded
and I'm sure the streets

00:13:16.862 --> 00:13:19.942
in the main part of the city
are pretty flooded as well.

00:13:19.942 --> 00:13:24.490
So we're hoping that the
driver for this tuk tuk,

00:13:24.490 --> 00:13:26.540
I think he lives right down there.

00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:28.873
And he's coming to drive us.

00:13:29.776 --> 00:13:31.026
We are in luck.

00:13:31.938 --> 00:13:35.521
We got a tuk tuk, on
our way to dinner now.

00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:41.754
Whoa, whoa, we almost tipped ...

00:13:41.754 --> 00:13:43.501
Whoa, that's pretty deep.

00:13:43.501 --> 00:13:44.876
(laughter)

00:13:44.876 --> 00:13:46.761
Oh, there's some pot holes in that flood.

00:13:46.761 --> 00:13:49.180
'Kay, and we are on our way
to go eat Khmer barbecue

00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:50.669
for dinner.

00:13:50.669 --> 00:13:51.912
And that rain ...

00:13:51.912 --> 00:13:53.108
That rain really made a difference.

00:13:53.108 --> 00:13:54.466
It's nice and cool now.

00:13:54.466 --> 00:13:56.749
And that's actually why
it was so blazing hot

00:13:56.749 --> 00:13:57.968
when we were having lunch.

00:13:57.968 --> 00:14:01.422
Hello, Phnom Penh afternoon traffic.

00:14:01.422 --> 00:14:05.089
(rhythmic electronic music)

00:14:15.681 --> 00:14:16.953
For dinner tonight, we're at a local Khmer

00:14:16.953 --> 00:14:18.286
barbecue restaurant.

00:14:18.286 --> 00:14:19.976
And they have some really
unique and interesting

00:14:19.976 --> 00:14:21.217
dishes on their menu.

00:14:21.217 --> 00:14:23.104
I wanna first say a big thank you to

00:14:23.104 --> 00:14:26.218
Lina Goldberg from Mukhta,
Cambodia for this recommendation.

00:14:26.218 --> 00:14:28.778
This is kind of a ...

00:14:28.778 --> 00:14:31.297
Okay, it's very much a beer
garden, but they also have

00:14:31.297 --> 00:14:33.471
a huge menu full of food.

00:14:33.471 --> 00:14:36.562
But this is a very popular
meal to eat Khmer barbecue

00:14:36.562 --> 00:14:39.408
for dinner and to come
hang out with your friends.

00:14:39.408 --> 00:14:40.853
They've just started
playing some live music

00:14:40.853 --> 00:14:42.699
so I hope you can hear me alright.

00:14:42.699 --> 00:14:44.299
But a couple of the
dishes have just arrived,

00:14:44.299 --> 00:14:47.133
including this awesome dish
that I can't wait to try.

00:14:47.133 --> 00:14:49.633
It's fried goat with ant eggs.

00:14:51.028 --> 00:14:52.808
So you could basically
order this with whatever

00:14:52.808 --> 00:14:53.824
type of meat you wanted.

00:14:53.824 --> 00:14:56.213
So when I saw goat on the
menu, I had to go for the goat.

00:14:56.213 --> 00:14:57.456
There's goat chunks in here.

00:14:57.456 --> 00:14:59.082
I think that's the skin.

00:14:59.082 --> 00:15:00.494
These are kaffir lime
leaves, but I also smell

00:15:00.494 --> 00:15:03.221
a curry aroma to it, so I'm not
sure if there's curry leaves

00:15:03.221 --> 00:15:04.304
in here, too.

00:15:11.327 --> 00:15:12.910
Oh, that is insane.

00:15:14.764 --> 00:15:17.105
Oh, that goat meat is so tender.

00:15:17.105 --> 00:15:20.824
And those ants have a little
bit of a sour crunch to them.

00:15:20.824 --> 00:15:22.590
The skin is kinda fatty and creamy,

00:15:22.590 --> 00:15:24.988
well, fully fatty and creamy.

00:15:24.988 --> 00:15:29.155
And then it has this amazing
basily citrusy flavor to it.

00:15:30.926 --> 00:15:32.690
Oh man, that's good.

00:15:32.690 --> 00:15:34.915
The next dish over here
are the fried riblets.

00:15:34.915 --> 00:15:37.415
And these are deep fried ribs.

00:15:45.403 --> 00:15:46.952
Oh yeah.

00:15:46.952 --> 00:15:51.669
Oh, that's just deep fried
crunchy rib goodness.

00:15:51.669 --> 00:15:54.814
Fully crispified, so like ...

00:15:54.814 --> 00:15:56.695
A little bit oily, it's salty,

00:15:56.695 --> 00:15:57.991
you can taste the pepper on there.

00:15:57.991 --> 00:16:00.584
There are a few more meat
dishes that are on their way,

00:16:00.584 --> 00:16:04.751
but we also ordered just a plate
of random mixed vegetables.

00:16:07.710 --> 00:16:08.543
Yeah.

00:16:10.474 --> 00:16:11.856
Just their straight up stir fried ...

00:16:11.856 --> 00:16:14.902
It kinda has a tangy,
garlicky taste to it.

00:16:14.902 --> 00:16:16.659
The ribs are amazing, but this fried goat

00:16:16.659 --> 00:16:19.484
with red ant eggs is
just the superior dish

00:16:19.484 --> 00:16:21.151
of this meal so far.

00:16:26.338 --> 00:16:28.947
That is insanely good.

00:16:28.947 --> 00:16:31.010
That is really really quality ...

00:16:31.010 --> 00:16:33.177
That's a dish to remember.

00:16:34.327 --> 00:16:36.331
In English, it's known
as Lok Lak sometimes,

00:16:36.331 --> 00:16:39.422
or as shaken beef, but this
is more of a saucy version

00:16:39.422 --> 00:16:41.281
that I don't know if I've ever had before.

00:16:41.281 --> 00:16:42.629
These are nuggets of beef.

00:16:42.629 --> 00:16:43.844
They look like calf.

00:16:43.844 --> 00:16:45.541
They look nice and medium rare.

00:16:45.541 --> 00:16:47.701
There's an egg on the
side, there's french fries.

00:16:47.701 --> 00:16:51.118
This is a fantastic looking dish of beef.

00:16:52.953 --> 00:16:54.643
Oh, that is so juicy.

00:16:54.643 --> 00:16:58.822
Oh you can taste the blood of
that rareness of that beef,

00:16:58.822 --> 00:17:01.275
just kinda gushing with juice.

00:17:01.275 --> 00:17:02.650
This is the type of
restaurant where you just want

00:17:02.650 --> 00:17:05.306
to sit here and you wanna
be snacking on a dish

00:17:05.306 --> 00:17:07.030
and then you wanna order another dish.

00:17:07.030 --> 00:17:10.784
And you just kinda sit here,
enjoy, hang out with friends,

00:17:10.784 --> 00:17:12.735
and keep munching throughout the night.

00:17:12.735 --> 00:17:14.545
We just ordered another dish.

00:17:14.545 --> 00:17:16.538
This one is eel stir-fried with chili.

00:17:16.538 --> 00:17:17.433
It's said on the menu.

00:17:17.433 --> 00:17:18.779
And you can see these whole ...

00:17:18.779 --> 00:17:21.122
Just the whole pieces of chopped up eel.

00:17:21.122 --> 00:17:24.170
And what I love is there's
just a pile of herbs on top

00:17:24.170 --> 00:17:26.259
and that is so fragrant.

00:17:26.259 --> 00:17:28.209
I gotta take a whole bit of herbs first

00:17:28.209 --> 00:17:29.959
without even any eel.

00:17:32.890 --> 00:17:34.271
I only know the Thai
names for these herbs.

00:17:34.271 --> 00:17:37.214
But that has a little bit
of a licoricey taste to it.

00:17:37.214 --> 00:17:41.381
Wow, that's an herbacious
just explosion in your mouth.

00:17:46.519 --> 00:17:49.965
Oh, that's buttery, wonderful eel.

00:17:49.965 --> 00:17:53.215
And with those herbs, man, that's good.

00:17:54.562 --> 00:17:57.060
That is probably the tastiest Khmer meal

00:17:57.060 --> 00:17:58.356
that I've ever had.

00:17:58.356 --> 00:18:01.123
That food was unbelievably delicious.

00:18:01.123 --> 00:18:04.281
The flavors were just actually perfect.

00:18:04.281 --> 00:18:06.197
The herb mixtures, you
could taste the lemongrass,

00:18:06.197 --> 00:18:07.662
you could taste the pepper.

00:18:07.662 --> 00:18:11.472
They were salty and it is a
beer garden type of restaurant,

00:18:11.472 --> 00:18:14.519
but not only that, but also a really cool

00:18:14.519 --> 00:18:18.356
Cambodian experience because
they have a live band

00:18:18.356 --> 00:18:19.535
and they're playing Khmer music.

00:18:19.535 --> 00:18:22.590
And that's gonna complete this full day of

00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:25.736
local Khmer food in Phnom Penh.

00:18:25.736 --> 00:18:26.890
Breakfast was delicious,

00:18:26.890 --> 00:18:30.205
lunch was an adventure
and a very very local

00:18:30.205 --> 00:18:31.421
street food meal,

00:18:31.421 --> 00:18:34.631
and then dinner is just
a classic Cambodian Khmer

00:18:34.631 --> 00:18:37.214
barbecue feast with live music.

00:18:38.461 --> 00:18:40.566
This was a fantastic day in Phnom Penh.
