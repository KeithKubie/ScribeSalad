00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.980
What is covert narcissistic abuse?

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:10.200
Are you a victim, mind games?

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.260
Nobody enjoys being played, but narcissists enjoy playing them.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.720
They enjoy the game of cat-and-mouse and seek pleasure from reeling in their next vulnerable victim.

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:24.000
But more often than not, people who are prone to being taken advantage of by narcissists -

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.280
- overlook their innocent facades.

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:32.220
In fact, they often make excuses for them, even when they're being poorly mistreated by their toxic behavior.

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:35.668
Why is this? Because narcissists aren't always obvious.

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.520
They disguise themselves by being charmingly covert.

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:44.000
Here are five dangerous signs you're being abused by a covert narcissist.

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.380
One: They minimize your needs.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.940
Do you feel like you're giving more than you're receiving?

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:51.580
What about feeling small when you're around them?

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.740
Covert narcissists have a sneaky way of getting inside people's head -

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.660
- and making you believe like you're responsible for everything.

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:03.300
They rarely take fault and even when they do apologize they do it sparingly -

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.020
- and without meaning just to get you to forgive them.

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:11.800
They don't care for facts or logic, only what they want to hear or believe that benefits them.

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:17.340
Recognize that what you need is important too, so don't only yield for their benefits.

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:19.890
Two: They forget that you exist.

00:01:20.139 --> 00:01:23.819
Being passionate about a hobby or a career is an attractive trait.

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.800
But there's a fine line between passion and obsession.

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.960
If your friend or romantic partner often ignores you-

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.240
- or cancels plans with you to focus on their favorite activities -

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:39.200
Then it's a sign that they just don't care about you being understanding and open-minded.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.940
You probably always make up excuses for them.

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.600
You frequently say things like: "Well, they worked hard to get where they are today" -

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.320
"So I'm gonna be supportive... or, there's always next week. What's the rush?"

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.320
But this is exactly how they have you wrapped around their finger.

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.080
Don't let them have the upper hand and emphasize your boundaries.

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.820
Three: They project false humility.

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.100
Do they often cry to you and put themselves down saying they aren't good enough -

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.260
- or feel misunderstood?

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.820
Before believing them, recognize that this is a trap.

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.340
Covert narcissists like to play the victim card and feel like people never understand them enough.

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.080
They might be highly sensitive Individuals who say things like -

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.460
"If only people could understand how smart I am..." or "Why don't others appreciate who I am?"

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.040
They love surrounding themselves with those who can boost their ego.

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.520
It's better not to give in and dish out less compliments.

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.540
Four: They never approach you first and wait for you to come to them.

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.640
Covert narcissists feel a sense of entitlement.

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.500
They believe that they should be appreciated and noticed first by others -

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.920
- before giving someone attention in return.

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:48.160
They dislike being in a group full of people unless all eyes and talk are on them.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.020
If you find yourself constantly putting in all the work and go to them first -

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.600
- then you've become their little puppet.

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:59.080
Stand up for yourself and show them that you don't have all the time in the day to serve them.

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.760
You're better than that!

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.200
Five: They seem annoyed when you come to them with your problems

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.620
You're the reliable friend or partner -

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.960
- that can always count on to listen to them when they're having a bad day.

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:13.780
But you're human too. And sometimes, you have a bad day.

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.600
When you run into trouble, do they grow impatient or frustrated -

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.900
- and have a habit of dismissing your emotions?

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:25.000
If they claim they're too busy to help you deal with your problems, then it's clear they lack empathy.

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.239
A strong indicator that they're a narcissist at heart.

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:33.660
It's better to find someone who treats you right instead of being with someone who takes you for granted.

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.520
