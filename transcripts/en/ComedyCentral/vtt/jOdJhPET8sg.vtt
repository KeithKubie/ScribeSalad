00:00:00.934 --> 00:00:03.270
<i>the epic finale
of "Cupcake Wars".</i>

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:04.505
What should we watch?

00:00:04.605 --> 00:00:05.772
Uh, you wanna do a movie?

00:00:05.873 --> 00:00:07.207
What time is it?

00:00:07.307 --> 00:00:10.110
11:30?
All right.

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:13.313
If we watch a 90 minute movie,
I'd take an Ambien in an hour--

00:00:13.413 --> 00:00:15.382
You wanna take a shower.

00:00:15.482 --> 00:00:16.650
No, I'm not.

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:17.885
All right, whatever.

00:00:17.985 --> 00:00:20.320
You wanna see
what's on demand?

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.056
Yeah, what are the free ones?

00:00:23.156 --> 00:00:24.725
(announcer)
<i>See it live with Pay-Per-View</i>

00:00:24.825 --> 00:00:26.493
<i>from Time Warner Cable.</i>

00:00:26.593 --> 00:00:29.530
<i>Catch Reese Witherspoon in
"Squiggle Dumb Dumb".</i>

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:31.231
<i>Jim Carrey in
"Holocaust Downs."</i>

00:00:31.331 --> 00:00:33.000
Oh, my God,
can you mute it?

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.401
I'm going to kill myself.
I'm trying.

00:00:38.472 --> 00:00:40.274
All right, any of these--
Do you like these?

00:00:40.374 --> 00:00:42.042
Mmm.

00:00:42.142 --> 00:00:43.577
Uh, what's "Lake Placid"?

00:00:43.677 --> 00:00:45.812
Uh, "An enormous crocodile--"

00:00:45.913 --> 00:00:47.080
No, no, no.

00:00:47.181 --> 00:00:48.882
Read more descriptions.

00:00:48.982 --> 00:00:51.351
"Kevin Kline is a single father
renovating a secret barn--"

00:00:51.451 --> 00:00:52.753
Mm-mm.

00:00:52.853 --> 00:00:54.021
"In 1950s Lebanon--"

00:00:54.121 --> 00:00:55.255
No.

00:00:55.355 --> 00:00:57.491
Ooh, "Pitch Perfect"!

00:00:57.591 --> 00:00:58.859
No.
No, no, no.

00:00:58.959 --> 00:01:00.093
We're not watching
"Pitch Perfect" again.

00:01:00.194 --> 00:01:01.361
You liked it.

00:01:01.461 --> 00:01:02.596
No, I dealt with it.

00:01:02.696 --> 00:01:04.231
Let's go to
the Showtime movies.

00:01:04.331 --> 00:01:05.899
Yeah, no.

00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:08.702
Oh, we have that documentary
on whale fracking.

00:01:08.802 --> 00:01:11.104
It's like,
the worst kind of fracking.

00:01:11.205 --> 00:01:14.775
I think they found a worse
fracking since they made that.

00:01:14.875 --> 00:01:17.110
There's no way.
I dunno, we know
we're gonna watch it.

00:01:17.211 --> 00:01:19.613
Like we're definitely
watching it.
Right, okay.

00:01:19.713 --> 00:01:22.082
So, just-- but tonight doesn't
feel like the right night.
All right, I agree.

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:23.450
We'll definitely
watch it.

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:24.751
We'll do something else.
Yeah, just find something..

00:01:24.852 --> 00:01:27.287
What about, uh,
"Amore"?

00:01:27.387 --> 00:01:29.590
No, I don't feel
like hearing accents.

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:31.391
I think it's "Amor".
"Amor".

00:01:31.491 --> 00:01:32.993
"Spring Breakers".

00:01:35.796 --> 00:01:38.298
"Paranormal Sexual Assault".
No.

00:01:38.398 --> 00:01:40.567
"The Decapitating".
"The Frightening".

00:01:40.667 --> 00:01:43.103
"The Crispening".
What?

00:01:43.136 --> 00:01:44.271
"The Worsening".

00:01:44.371 --> 00:01:46.807
"The Haunting
of David Finklestein".

00:01:46.907 --> 00:01:48.242
There's "Evil Dead".

00:01:48.342 --> 00:01:49.610
No.

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.378
No, I'm like,
already scared all the time.

00:01:51.478 --> 00:01:53.113
I really don't want
to add to that.

00:01:53.213 --> 00:01:54.815
Someone told me it's
not actually not that scary.

00:01:54.915 --> 00:01:56.483
It's more like just
light raping.

00:01:56.583 --> 00:01:58.285
What's the description?

00:01:58.385 --> 00:02:00.220
"'Evil Dead.'
Captured in the woods,

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:01.622
"an injured girl is restrained
in a basement.

00:02:01.722 --> 00:02:03.223
"Her father sets her
on fire and shoots her dead.

00:02:03.323 --> 00:02:04.491
Which is what she deserves."

00:02:04.591 --> 00:02:05.893
No. I just want to relax.

00:02:06.059 --> 00:02:07.227
All right.

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:12.766
He made a "Twilight"?

00:02:12.866 --> 00:02:14.168
Why aren't you using
Page Down?

00:02:14.268 --> 00:02:16.837
I'm using Page Down.
Oh.

00:02:16.937 --> 00:02:19.606
"The Darker the Berry
The Sweeter the Drank"?

00:02:19.706 --> 00:02:20.841
That's true.

00:02:20.941 --> 00:02:22.676
You want to start a series?

00:02:22.776 --> 00:02:24.244
I never saw "Carnivàle" on HBO.

00:02:24.344 --> 00:02:25.479
Ooh, "Cocktail"!

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:27.080
What? What?

00:02:27.181 --> 00:02:28.415
"Cocktail".
The movie.

00:02:28.515 --> 00:02:29.683
I don't think I've seen that.

00:02:29.783 --> 00:02:31.852
Are you serious?
Yeah.

00:02:31.952 --> 00:02:34.421
Tom Cruise is a struggling
flair bartender.

00:02:34.521 --> 00:02:36.557
You never saw "Cocktail"?

00:02:36.657 --> 00:02:38.325
Oh my God, it's so good,
it's amazing.

00:02:38.425 --> 00:02:39.426
No, that's it,
we're watching it.

00:02:39.526 --> 00:02:40.827
Well, no--
We're watching it.

00:02:40.928 --> 00:02:42.663
You've already seen it.
Yeah, but I want
to watch you watch it.

00:02:42.763 --> 00:02:44.364
Oh, it's so awesome.

00:02:44.464 --> 00:02:45.632
We're watching it.
Fine.

00:02:45.732 --> 00:02:46.867
We're doing it.

00:02:46.967 --> 00:02:49.169
"Cocktail".

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:51.538
You're gonna freak out.

00:02:51.638 --> 00:02:53.941
Oh, my God.

00:02:54.107 --> 00:03:00.280
(music plays on TV)

00:03:07.387 --> 00:03:08.956
I feel like I'm remembering

00:03:09.056 --> 00:03:10.524
they don't start
bartending for, like,

00:03:10.624 --> 00:03:12.159
10 minutes into the movie.

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:13.894
I'm just going
to fast forward to that.

00:03:14.061 --> 00:03:16.330
But just the set-up, like,
he's having a hard time.

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.332
Oh my God, this part.

00:03:18.432 --> 00:03:20.968
Oh my God.

00:03:21.068 --> 00:03:22.402
Oh my God.

00:03:22.503 --> 00:03:23.804
(man)
<i>You wanna see a cocktail menu?</i>

00:03:23.904 --> 00:03:25.072
(man 2)
<i>Uh, no.</i>

00:03:25.138 --> 00:03:28.442
<i>I'm not drinking, thanks.</i>

00:03:32.446 --> 00:03:33.580
<i>(bell chimes)</i>

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.549
Yeah, he caught it.
Okay.

00:03:35.649 --> 00:03:37.885
So is that--
Is that kind of the gist of it?

00:03:37.985 --> 00:03:39.520
They just do tricks.

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.690
Like, so much-- They get into
so many shenanigans.

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:51.498
Oh, we need ice cream.

00:03:51.598 --> 00:03:52.499
I'm going to go
get some ice cream.

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:54.001
What--
I'm gonna run out.

00:03:54.101 --> 00:03:55.669
If you're going to be gone,
I'll pause it.
No, no, no, don't pause it.

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:56.904
Watch it.
You-- Watch this.

00:03:57.004 --> 00:04:00.707
You're gonna... watch it.

00:04:00.807 --> 00:04:02.242

00:04:02.342 --> 00:04:03.510

<i>Yeah.</i>

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:07.147
(man)
<i>Oh wow, great bar.</i>

00:04:18.125 --> 00:04:21.361
<i>♪ When I'm leave
