Hey,
did you see tiger yesterday?
Dude,
I was watching it while we were in Georgia.

2
00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:09.690
We were in Georgia for the UFC and I had a comedy show out there and we were me

3
00:00:09.691 --> 00:00:13.530
and um,
Santino or watching it on the screen.
Ah,

4
00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:17.550
on Saturday or yesterday.
We watched it Friday or was it Friday or Saturday?

5
00:00:17.551 --> 00:00:20.970
Saturday.
So Friday,
Saturday,
and then he won yesterday.
Well,
whatever days it was,

6
00:00:20.971 --> 00:00:22.680
right.
I think we watched it two days in a row.

7
00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:24.270
It was in the gym every day we were there,

8
00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.020
but then I got home and I saw it on my phone.
I was like,
Holy Shit,

9
00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:31.890
I don't even give a fuck about golf.
I know I'm able to speak powerful.

10
00:00:31.891 --> 00:00:36.600
I made a comeback,
a huge comeback with that.
I mean that's amazing.

11
00:00:36.601 --> 00:00:39.930
Are 11 years later,
oh my God,

12
00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:43.320
those selling somebody's put on Instagram.

13
00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.890
One of my quotes that I attached to that,

14
00:00:46.891 --> 00:00:51.720
it was pretty cool that I love a guy,
get a like I love,

15
00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.620
what did I say?
I love a success story,
but even more than that,

16
00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.160
I love a guy fucked his life up and then gets it back together again.
Story.

17
00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:01.660
It's the greatest,
it's the greatest.

18
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.410
When you realize like how much of us good must field to that guy,

19
00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.310
top of the world again.
And then he like,
yeah,
I'm so messed up.

20
00:01:08.311 --> 00:01:12.870
And then the back problems and troubles in the kids and the wife and the thing

21
00:01:12.871 --> 00:01:16.680
and just 11 years.
Yup.
And he didn't stop working.

22
00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.490
He just went to work and went to work and went to where he is 11 years later.

23
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.790
And so he won a major championship recently,
right?
Didn't he won when one,

24
00:01:24.791 --> 00:01:27.860
it was a big deal.
He won a major championship within the last,

25
00:01:27.861 --> 00:01:31.470
it wasn't a manager,
but it was,
it wasn't a major this,
this was the first major.

26
00:01:31.471 --> 00:01:34.230
He's one in 11 years.
Okay.
So the other one wasn't a major,

27
00:01:34.231 --> 00:01:37.080
but it was a big event.
It was a big tournament.
He wins that one.

28
00:01:37.081 --> 00:01:39.870
Everybody's like,
wow,
he might be back.
He can,

29
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.410
he can fucking win big tournament's again.
And then he just,
Oh,

30
00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:44.580
it was so cool to see.

31
00:01:44.581 --> 00:01:49.290
The crowd just kept building over the weekend and by yesterday it was massive.

32
00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.000
Thousands of people around the green just hanging on him.
Oh,

33
00:01:54.001 --> 00:01:58.140
the relief that you saw just coming out of him was so great.
And then at the end,

34
00:01:58.141 --> 00:02:02.490
like he walks off where as a kid he was only like 21 when he were on the first

35
00:02:02.491 --> 00:02:07.260
time hugging his dad at the edge.
And now he comes off 11 years later,

36
00:02:07.261 --> 00:02:11.910
all this time.
And His dad's passed and he's hugging his child,
his son.

37
00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.230
Now he's the father in the same spot.
Oh.
It was just,

38
00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.300
I was trying not to cry the whole time.
Oh,

39
00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.580
it was such a tear jerker what relief.

40
00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.990
People were just so happy for him.
Wow.
Such a great story.

41
00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.470
We do love a comeback.
Why not man?
You love a comeback.
We,

42
00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.960
we're all flawed like you were saying before.
But yeah,
man,
being able to improve,

43
00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.950
that's what that guy,
did he have it down in and pre improved.
