that way which kind of you might have
 

00:09:39.459 --> 00:09:41.040
that way which kind of you might have
stolen my next question but obviously

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:41.050
stolen my next question but obviously
 

00:09:41.050 --> 00:09:43.769
stolen my next question but obviously
are you're working of my neck session

00:09:43.769 --> 00:09:43.779
are you're working of my neck session
 

00:09:43.779 --> 00:09:46.470
are you're working of my neck session
was what are you working on now is what

00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:46.480
was what are you working on now is what
 

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:48.239
was what are you working on now is what
is this series taking up the majority of

00:09:48.239 --> 00:09:48.249
is this series taking up the majority of
 

00:09:48.249 --> 00:09:51.090
is this series taking up the majority of
your time outside teaching yeah so I

00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:51.100
your time outside teaching yeah so I
 

00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:53.340
your time outside teaching yeah so I
have I have like three book projects

00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:53.350
have I have like three book projects
 

00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:55.169
have I have like three book projects
which is kind of ridiculous and it's

00:09:55.169 --> 00:09:55.179
which is kind of ridiculous and it's
 

00:09:55.179 --> 00:09:57.269
which is kind of ridiculous and it's
ridiculous because I kind of moved from

00:09:57.269 --> 00:09:57.279
ridiculous because I kind of moved from
 

00:09:57.279 --> 00:09:59.480
ridiculous because I kind of moved from
one to the other to the other and so

00:09:59.480 --> 00:09:59.490
one to the other to the other and so
 

00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:01.799
one to the other to the other and so
once almost done and the other two are

00:10:01.799 --> 00:10:01.809
once almost done and the other two are
 

00:10:01.809 --> 00:10:05.340
once almost done and the other two are
you know almost almost done and the

00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:05.350
you know almost almost done and the
 

00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:09.540
you know almost almost done and the
reason they haven't quite gotten done is

00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:09.550
reason they haven't quite gotten done is
 

00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:11.249
reason they haven't quite gotten done is
because of the book series so the book

00:10:11.249 --> 00:10:11.259
because of the book series so the book
 

00:10:11.259 --> 00:10:13.559
because of the book series so the book
series really is taking up a huge amount

00:10:13.559 --> 00:10:13.569
series really is taking up a huge amount
 

00:10:13.569 --> 00:10:16.379
series really is taking up a huge amount
of time the reason I mean it's fun time

00:10:16.379 --> 00:10:16.389
of time the reason I mean it's fun time
 

00:10:16.389 --> 00:10:19.790
of time the reason I mean it's fun time
I get to correspond with great scholars

00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:19.800
I get to correspond with great scholars
 

00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:22.199
I get to correspond with great scholars
international scholars about how to

00:10:22.199 --> 00:10:22.209
international scholars about how to
 

00:10:22.209 --> 00:10:26.079
international scholars about how to
think about the medieval section

00:10:26.079 --> 00:10:26.089
think about the medieval section
 

00:10:26.089 --> 00:10:29.980
think about the medieval section
on evil or space or eternity and these

00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:29.990
on evil or space or eternity and these
 

00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:32.019
on evil or space or eternity and these
are really kind of fun things to have to

00:10:32.019 --> 00:10:32.029
are really kind of fun things to have to
 

00:10:32.029 --> 00:10:34.119
are really kind of fun things to have to
do and so that would take some time

00:10:34.119 --> 00:10:34.129
do and so that would take some time
 

00:10:34.129 --> 00:10:36.549
do and so that would take some time
anyway but what really is taking time is

00:10:36.549 --> 00:10:36.559
anyway but what really is taking time is
 

00:10:36.559 --> 00:10:39.280
anyway but what really is taking time is
that I mean the good news is that the

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:39.290
that I mean the good news is that the
 

00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:41.499
that I mean the good news is that the
editors have been quite taken so these

00:10:41.499 --> 00:10:41.509
editors have been quite taken so these
 

00:10:41.509 --> 00:10:43.540
editors have been quite taken so these
are serious scholars and history

00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:43.550
are serious scholars and history
 

00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:45.610
are serious scholars and history
philosophy and they've been completely

00:10:45.610 --> 00:10:45.620
philosophy and they've been completely
 

00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:48.730
philosophy and they've been completely
taken by this idea of including these

00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:48.740
taken by this idea of including these
 

00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:51.970
taken by this idea of including these
interdisciplinary editions but the

00:10:51.970 --> 00:10:51.980
interdisciplinary editions but the
 

00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:53.829
interdisciplinary editions but the
question is how to do it and one thing

00:10:53.829 --> 00:10:53.839
question is how to do it and one thing
 

00:10:53.839 --> 00:10:56.920
question is how to do it and one thing
we've decided is that they can't be just

00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:56.930
we've decided is that they can't be just
 

00:10:56.930 --> 00:10:58.929
we've decided is that they can't be just
fun you know if you're doing a volume on

00:10:58.929 --> 00:10:58.939
fun you know if you're doing a volume on
 

00:10:58.939 --> 00:11:01.150
fun you know if you're doing a volume on
the virtues it might be really fun to

00:11:01.150 --> 00:11:01.160
the virtues it might be really fun to
 

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:04.030
the virtues it might be really fun to
have just representations of the virtues

00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:04.040
have just representations of the virtues
 

00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:05.679
have just representations of the virtues
of the history of art or something and

00:11:05.679 --> 00:11:05.689
of the history of art or something and
 

00:11:05.689 --> 00:11:07.660
of the history of art or something and
that will probably be included by the

00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:07.670
that will probably be included by the
 

00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:11.470
that will probably be included by the
way but you want to find examples from

00:11:11.470 --> 00:11:11.480
way but you want to find examples from
 

00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:15.489
way but you want to find examples from
theater literature or maybe in some

00:11:15.489 --> 00:11:15.499
theater literature or maybe in some
 

00:11:15.499 --> 00:11:17.769
theater literature or maybe in some
cases if it's relevant in a Hindu views

00:11:17.769 --> 00:11:17.779
cases if it's relevant in a Hindu views
 

00:11:17.779 --> 00:11:19.869
cases if it's relevant in a Hindu views
of some of these issues that are

00:11:19.869 --> 00:11:19.879
of some of these issues that are
 

00:11:19.879 --> 00:11:22.439
of some of these issues that are
actually philosophically interesting and

00:11:22.439 --> 00:11:22.449
actually philosophically interesting and
 

00:11:22.449 --> 00:11:24.730
actually philosophically interesting and
approach the topic from a different

approach the topic from a different
 

00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:27.730
approach the topic from a different
perspective so insofar as it's different

people have are having to think hard and

00:11:31.629 --> 00:11:31.639
people have are having to think hard and
 

00:11:31.639 --> 00:11:34.809
people have are having to think hard and
expand our imaginations really to do

00:11:34.809 --> 00:11:34.819
expand our imaginations really to do
 

00:11:34.819 --> 00:11:36.400
expand our imaginations really to do
that and do it well and so we're all

00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:36.410
that and do it well and so we're all
 

00:11:36.410 --> 00:11:38.690
that and do it well and so we're all
kind of working together to do that

00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:38.700
kind of working together to do that
 

00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:41.270
kind of working together to do that
and that is that's taking time do not

00:11:41.270 --> 00:11:41.280
and that is that's taking time do not
 

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:42.980
and that is that's taking time do not
