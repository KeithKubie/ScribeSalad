1
00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.600
Man,
I had my hand down and he caught me sleeping,

2
00:00:03.601 --> 00:00:05.670
so he caught Moody's Sheils a lucky shot.

3
00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:07.110
He's not ever going to do that shit to me.

4
00:00:07.111 --> 00:00:10.560
If I next time I'm going to get him or he can't move the slicks and miss and I

5
00:00:10.561 --> 00:00:14.880
never seen that before.
I'm a train for next time he's getting gum.
I'm stop him.

6
00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:17.520
My thing is even the wrestling,

7
00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.920
what I always wanted to do as I wanted to tech fall guys in wrestling and tech

8
00:00:22.921 --> 00:00:26.280
fall,
what that means is when you're being in someone by 15 points,

9
00:00:26.281 --> 00:00:27.600
you have a 15 point gap.

10
00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.130
They stopped the mat because it's basically a skunk like you skunked this guy.

11
00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.340
Like he sucked at that.
You beaten them that bad.
They had to stop it.

12
00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.020
That is my mentality.
That is always what I strive for and in 2011 I believe,

13
00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.980
I'm not 2011 2009 I led the nation in Division One,

14
00:00:43.981 --> 00:00:47.100
two and three Nai,
whatever in tech falls.

15
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.600
I think at one point me and Brent Metcalf was battling like every week I would

16
00:00:51.601 --> 00:00:54.870
look and see who had the most tech fault.
It was me,
be him,
be me,

17
00:00:54.871 --> 00:00:59.871
him and I had the most because that's my was my goal is I want it to skunk guys

18
00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.670
because in their mind what it says is you can't fuck with that guy.

19
00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.310
There's,
you can't hang with him.
There was nothing.
You can do it.
It didn't,

20
00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.510
it wasn't a quick pan of lucky pin or or this like he destroyed you.

21
00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.140
He just set levels apart and that's what I do even in fighting now I do the

22
00:01:19.141 --> 00:01:23.760
exact same thing is I would much rather dominant you from start to finish.

23
00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.360
I want to break you.
I don't want,
I want you think about fighting me again.

24
00:01:27.361 --> 00:01:30.690
It's not you don't,
I don't want you to you.
I want you to say fuck no,
I don't.

25
00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.290
I should know shit.
No,
he beat me everywhere.
He broke me.

26
00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.850
He took something from me because you're going to think about it.

27
00:01:37.851 --> 00:01:41.160
You only remember the fights you lose.
You don't like.

28
00:01:41.161 --> 00:01:42.430
I've been so many guys in wrestling.

29
00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.350
I can't tell you maybe 30 guys that I beaten wrestling.
I don't have no idea.

30
00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:49.980
But the ones you lose,
you can almost tell everyone.

31
00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.080
And that's what my take on it.
I want to dominate you so bad.

32
00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.770
When you think about fighting me again.
You don't,
you say fuck that.

33
00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.710
I'll pass on that Phi.
And so people were like,
Oh man,

34
00:02:01.711 --> 00:02:05.160
this guy doesn't really finish guys.
But how many guys want to fight me again?

35
00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.320
Not a lot of them.
Do you have one loss in MMA?
Yes,
I do one loss.
Right?
Yeah.

36
00:02:10.321 --> 00:02:13.410
I have one last is my second fight.
Um,

37
00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.510
uh Caceres I forget his name.

38
00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.030
I forget his first name.
Um,

39
00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.860
it's the cassette hoser is Jose cause there's,
there's no Alex Caceres.
Yeah,

40
00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.460
it's Jose cause his name is Jose crosshairs alleys considered old,

41
00:02:29.461 --> 00:02:33.380
I think his older brother.
Ah,
yeah.
And I'm man,
it was a,

42
00:02:33.381 --> 00:02:36.600
I took the final like a two weeks notice or something like that because it was

43
00:02:36.601 --> 00:02:41.040
like eight months in between.
I fought my first fight.
And I thought,
see,

44
00:02:41.041 --> 00:02:41.860
that's the thing with Emmett,

45
00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.670
with fighters coming in to MMA now this is a lesson to you guys.

46
00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.940
Everyone feels like,
oh,
I'm just going to jump in and it's going to be peachy.

47
00:02:47.941 --> 00:02:51.720
I'm gonna be getting fights every other week,
every other month.
No.

48
00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.050
So I fought my first fight.
I thought,
okay,
this is great.

49
00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.680
My career's kickstarting,
I'm going to be doing fight.
He's never used so often.

50
00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.560
I went through 20 I 22 opponents within my first fight.

51
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.220
If I got the second fight,
because now,
you know as Google,
now everyone,

52
00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.370
all froggies national champion wrestling.

53
00:03:11.371 --> 00:03:14.080
And I don't want to fight that because everyone wants to get to the UFC and they

54
00:03:14.081 --> 00:03:17.620
figure,
oh,
it's the best record.
You want to be undefeated to get to the UFC.

55
00:03:17.621 --> 00:03:21.160
So nobody wants to fight anyone.
That's hard.
Right?
And so of course,

56
00:03:21.161 --> 00:03:22.300
at that point I was a wrestler.

57
00:03:22.301 --> 00:03:25.120
I could take anyone down to hold them down for three rounds and went fight.

58
00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:27.550
So everyone,
no one wanted that fight.

59
00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:31.420
So it was months and months went by.

60
00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.640
And then that fight came about.
I was just like,
shit,

61
00:03:33.641 --> 00:03:36.940
I'll take you and I'll be honest,
I never grappled before that.

62
00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:41.500
I never did Jujitsu and so I figured I could rest on my way,

63
00:03:41.501 --> 00:03:45.490
do all this shit like,
man,
fuck these guys.
These guys are all low level guys.

64
00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:49.690
You know.
Look who I trained with a train.
We were shot Evans and these guys,

65
00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:53.560
those guys can't touch me.
I get in a fight,

66
00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:58.300
I throw a one to his legs are there.
I hit him with a one,
two boom,
boom,

67
00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:01.180
double leg,
like live within 15 seconds.
Boom.

68
00:04:01.181 --> 00:04:04.240
Threw him down full mouth and I'm kind of throwing punches.

69
00:04:04.241 --> 00:04:05.470
I didn't really know what I was doing.

70
00:04:05.471 --> 00:04:10.240
I'm throwing punches and I'm trying to elbow him and Jose could stereotype I

71
00:04:10.241 --> 00:04:14.290
think six,
two,
six one one six.
I don't know.
He's well taller than me.

72
00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.710
Long limbs.
He throws his legs.

73
00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:21.100
I'm in full mount and he throws his legs around my body.

74
00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.960
I never seen no shit like that before.
Right.

75
00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:31.330
My mind at that time was like,
what is,
Oh shit,
what's this shit?

76
00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:33.730
I didn't know what to do.
So I'm like,

77
00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.590
so I started kind of panicking in my mind,
I don't know what to do.
I'm like,

78
00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.720
fucking get out,
which is what you don't do.
Right.
So I turned my body,

79
00:04:43.721 --> 00:04:47.230
I'm trying to like get up and walk out,
which is what you don't do.

80
00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:51.760
And so he just basically climbed up my back.
Boom.

81
00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:54.460
We're not even sweating yet.
Boom.
He's on my back.

82
00:04:54.461 --> 00:04:58.300
I'm standing up with a backpack on.
He's six,
so something,

83
00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:00.910
he has a foot on the ground,
one foot wrapped around me.

84
00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:03.440
He's fighting for the choke and I,

85
00:05:03.441 --> 00:05:06.340
I think I hold them off for another like minute and a half.

86
00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:08.620
I'm standing and I'm fighting this choke.

87
00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:13.540
All the while I'm thinking like,
Oh shit,

88
00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:19.030
I can't go down cause I don't know what the fuck I'm doing down there as well.

89
00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:22.590
So I don't really know the defense down there.
So if I go down,

90
00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:23.620
I just might make it worse.

91
00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:26.560
I don't know the defense and this dude looks like he knows what he's doing

92
00:05:26.561 --> 00:05:31.020
behind me.
He's got a few more,
he's got a few fights and I'm,

93
00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:34.810
I'm kinda scared and I'm fighting it now I'm standing up,

94
00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:39.010
my feet are getting heavy,
getting shaky.
I'm like,

95
00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:40.810
I'm a strong guy.

96
00:05:40.811 --> 00:05:44.650
What the fuck am I feet shaking because they're starting to fill up with blood.

97
00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:49.000
My adrenaline is pumping and I'm just like,
Oh shit,

98
00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:52.660
I'm about to lose
Joe.

99
00:05:52.661 --> 00:05:55.620
There's this moment in your mind to it.

100
00:05:55.621 --> 00:05:59.540
You start to come to realization certain things.
Yeah.
I'm like,
Oh shit,

101
00:05:59.541 --> 00:06:01.790
I'm about to lose and what?

102
00:06:01.791 --> 00:06:06.350
And then I start thinking about random thoughts and one of the thoughts that I

103
00:06:06.351 --> 00:06:09.950
thought thought about was before the fire,

104
00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:14.980
we had a commission meeting in the bag and the commission said if you get choked

105
00:06:15.531 --> 00:06:19.970
unconscious,
you're suspended for six months.
So you can't fight for six months.

106
00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:23.840
Because in my mind I'm like,
fuck this.
I'm a tough guy.
I'm,

107
00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:28.550
you got to put me to sleep.
I ain't never tapping.
So I'm like,

108
00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:29.743
if I get,

109
00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:33.860
it took me eight months to get this fight and this is short notice fight.

110
00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:36.770
I haven't made money in eight months.
I'm broke as shit.

111
00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:41.060
I sleep and I live with Rashad.
I live with another man.

112
00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:45.290
I'm broke as shit.
I have no money.
I need money.

113
00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:49.550
So if I can't fight for another six months,
I have no money.

114
00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:53.180
So all these thoughts going through my mind,

115
00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:57.650
and I hear Alex Caceres on the other side of the case screaming.

116
00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:02.240
He is gonna tap.
He's,
they're both out.
And I'm like,
fuck,

117
00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:07.050
am I going to die?
I'm like,

118
00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:12.000
fucking well-played Alex.
Now I'm thinking about to happen just for that shit.

119
00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:15.740
Oh Man.
I just saw it going down and I'm like,

120
00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:19.880
you can't be suspended for six months,
Bro.
I know you want to be tough right now.

121
00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:22.580
You want to go to sleep?
What?
You can't be suspended for six months,
Bro.

122
00:07:22.581 --> 00:07:26.690
You have to,
you gotta.
You know you gotta make money,
you're broke.

123
00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:31.940
I fucking tapped Joe.
I've fucking dad.
I never felt so,

124
00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:36.860
I don't want to say a masculinity if that's the word.

125
00:07:36.861 --> 00:07:40.670
I never felt so like I just,
that's when I said like win or lose,

126
00:07:40.671 --> 00:07:44.900
it takes something from you.
And I walked out of that fight.
I went to the back,

127
00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:49.610
I paced for like maybe two,
three hours in the back.
All the fights fit,

128
00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:54.290
finished up and I finally went to locker and got my stuff and came out.

129
00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:58.220
But I just pace back and forth and the feeling and my mind was,

130
00:07:58.630 --> 00:08:03.170
I am never going to feel like this again.
I do not ever want to feel like this.

131
00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:07.280
And ever since then I got a fucking gate.
I never had to give me four.
I got a g,

132
00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:09.290
I started training with George Santiago,

133
00:08:09.291 --> 00:08:12.160
my you do to coach people to every fucking morning.
I was like Bro,

134
00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:14.800
get your black belt after he came in my black Bra.

135
00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:19.400
And this is the thing is I never,
I never worried about that.

136
00:08:19.401 --> 00:08:24.380
I never worried about like yes I was freaking beaten up blue belts before I was

137
00:08:24.381 --> 00:08:27.950
even a white belt.
Like yeah cause I never did that skill trained.

138
00:08:27.951 --> 00:08:32.951
Did you choose to skills but like I knew how to grapple through certain things.

139
00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:37.820
You know,
I've been grappling it hard at high level but it wasn't just Jujitsu.

140
00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:42.800
So he kept challenging me,
like I was always cause I want to be that guy.

141
00:08:42.801 --> 00:08:45.230
I want to be the freaking blue belt that freaking works.

142
00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:49.010
All the brown and black belts.
But he would freaking promote me.

143
00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:52.250
It's like Purple Bell because you've been training,
you trained in the G,

144
00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:55.800
I'm gonna promote you.
So he kept challenging me and challenging them soul.

145
00:08:55.801 --> 00:08:57.090
Now people knew.

146
00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:01.200
I felt like all it was doing was alerting people of what to expect when they

147
00:09:01.201 --> 00:09:05.220
went with me and for them to try to,
to really fuck me up.

148
00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:08.070
And so he promoted me.
Um,

149
00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:10.920
I think a couple of years ago I was a brown belt proponent,

150
00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:14.310
I think maybe two and a half,
three years ago.
And um,

151
00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:17.310
and then promoted me to black belt.
He just asked me to come in and gym.

152
00:09:17.311 --> 00:09:19.530
I didn't really even know.
I just felt like,
okay man,

153
00:09:19.531 --> 00:09:24.060
he wants everyone to take pictures with the bell and a fricking gives me my

154
00:09:24.210 --> 00:09:28.740
blackbelt.
And other thing just floored me.
I was like,
shit,
I never knew.

155
00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:32.460
I never expected all of this.
I just want it to fucking compete.

156
00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:36.390
I just wanted to be a martial artists,
learn all this stuff and compete.

157
00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:38.370
I never knew that I had to get a black belt.

158
00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:42.300
I never knew that I would win the championship belt and be the best in the world

159
00:09:42.301 --> 00:09:44.820
at this at that time.
So I never knew all that.
