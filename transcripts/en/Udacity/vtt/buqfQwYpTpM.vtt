00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I think to some extent the answers here are debatable,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
but the best answer that I would give to this question is

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
definitely a software under test that interacts directly with hardware devices

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
would consider the timing of inputs important. 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Also definitely software that interfaces with other machines on a network

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
might consider the timing of inputs important.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Software under test that's multi-threaded won't necessarily

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
depend on the time at which inputs are delivered,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
but it certainly might, and finally,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
I would not consider software under test that prints time values into a log file

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
to necessarily depend on the timing that its inputs are delivered.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
It's this kind of software--of which there are many examples--

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
a software that does care about time values because it's printing them

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
but probably its logic doesn't depend on these time values

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
because they're just being output to a device, and they're not being 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
depended on in any meaningful way.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Again, your mileage may vary on this, but my opinion is that 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
a, b, and c are the best answers.
