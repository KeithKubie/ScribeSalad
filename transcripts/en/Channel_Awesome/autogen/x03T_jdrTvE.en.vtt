00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:15.330
glove the palm was all cut out and then
 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:17.510
glove the palm was all cut out and then
there's about two to three kind of holes

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520
there's about two to three kind of holes
 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:22.110
there's about two to three kind of holes
cut out per finger so

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:22.120
cut out per finger so
 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.080
cut out per finger so
using the knife and the scissors kind of

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:25.090
using the knife and the scissors kind of
 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:30.690
using the knife and the scissors kind of
cut out making sure cannot cut to the

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:30.700
cut out making sure cannot cut to the
 

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:35.010
cut out making sure cannot cut to the
other side and if that look clean it

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:35.020
other side and if that look clean it
 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:38.670
other side and if that look clean it
could look like it was cut kind of curly

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:38.680
could look like it was cut kind of curly
 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:47.760
could look like it was cut kind of curly
and all kind of adds to the effect

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:47.770
 

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:50.219
so we're all done with that I'm going to

00:05:50.219 --> 00:05:50.229
so we're all done with that I'm going to
 

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:53.270
so we're all done with that I'm going to
cut out the nylon glove that the

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:53.280
cut out the nylon glove that the
 

00:05:53.280 --> 00:06:07.280
cut out the nylon glove that the
Halloween store version came with

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:07.290
 

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:09.080
and make sure it fits on that glove

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:09.090
and make sure it fits on that glove
 

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:16.350
and make sure it fits on that glove
pretty good yeah that's good

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:16.360
 

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:19.470
then I give the whole thing a coat

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:19.480
then I give the whole thing a coat
 

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:41.879
then I give the whole thing a coat
krylon flat black

00:06:41.879 --> 00:06:41.889
 

00:06:41.889 --> 00:06:43.830
of course once I did that I realized I

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:43.840
of course once I did that I realized I
 

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:46.980
of course once I did that I realized I
forgot to sharpen or shape the blades

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:46.990
forgot to sharpen or shape the blades
 

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:52.480
forgot to sharpen or shape the blades
and make them look like they were sharp

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:52.490
 

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:55.850
so then I went ahead and gave it a coat

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:55.860
so then I went ahead and gave it a coat
 

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:58.610
so then I went ahead and gave it a coat
of krylon metallic is kind of a gold

00:06:58.610 --> 00:06:58.620
of krylon metallic is kind of a gold
 

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:13.300
of krylon metallic is kind of a gold
finish

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:13.310
 

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:17.379
and then once that dried I went over it

00:07:17.379 --> 00:07:17.389
and then once that dried I went over it
 

00:07:17.389 --> 00:07:20.770
and then once that dried I went over it
with just a light dusting of Kryolan red

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:20.780
with just a light dusting of Kryolan red
 

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:26.170
with just a light dusting of Kryolan red
oxide and that gives it kind of that

00:07:26.170 --> 00:07:26.180
oxide and that gives it kind of that
 

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:29.170
oxide and that gives it kind of that
worn a little bit more copper or brass

00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:29.180
worn a little bit more copper or brass
 

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:43.640
worn a little bit more copper or brass
sort of look

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:43.650
 

00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:45.560
I used some old modeling things I think

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:45.570
I used some old modeling things I think
 

00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:48.290
I used some old modeling things I think
that Citadel games workshop modeling

00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:48.300
that Citadel games workshop modeling
 

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:57.420
that Citadel games workshop modeling
paint and that's a copper finish

00:07:57.420 --> 00:07:57.430
 

00:07:57.430 --> 00:08:06.330
it's went over the whole thing

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:06.340
 

00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:08.700
I did several passes and then wipe it

00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:08.710
I did several passes and then wipe it
 

00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:15.860
I did several passes and then wipe it
down with the paper towel

00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:15.870
 

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:17.660
this gives it a little bit more of an

00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:17.670
this gives it a little bit more of an
 

00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:21.530
this gives it a little bit more of an
uneven kind of quality like its aging

00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:21.540
uneven kind of quality like its aging
 

00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:42.329
uneven kind of quality like its aging
over time

00:08:42.329 --> 00:08:42.339
 

00:08:42.339 --> 00:08:45.059
once one layer would dry I would go over

00:08:45.059 --> 00:08:45.069
once one layer would dry I would go over
 

00:08:45.069 --> 00:08:59.689
once one layer would dry I would go over
it again do the same thing

00:08:59.689 --> 00:08:59.699
 

00:08:59.699 --> 00:09:02.929
then finally I just use the flat black

00:09:02.929 --> 00:09:02.939
then finally I just use the flat black
 

00:09:02.939 --> 00:09:07.699
then finally I just use the flat black
paint and a watered down do a wash kind

00:09:07.699 --> 00:09:07.709
paint and a watered down do a wash kind
 

00:09:07.709 --> 00:09:08.840
paint and a watered down do a wash kind
of getting all the little nooks and

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:08.850
of getting all the little nooks and
 

00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:10.309
of getting all the little nooks and
crannies and stuff like that it would

00:09:10.309 --> 00:09:10.319
crannies and stuff like that it would
 

00:09:10.319 --> 00:09:12.829
crannies and stuff like that it would
really make it kind of pop and make all

00:09:12.829 --> 00:09:12.839
really make it kind of pop and make all
 

00:09:12.839 --> 00:09:15.349
really make it kind of pop and make all
the elements look like it's old and

00:09:15.349 --> 00:09:15.359
the elements look like it's old and
 

00:09:15.359 --> 00:09:20.419
the elements look like it's old and
greasy and dirty its metallic elements

00:09:20.419 --> 00:09:20.429
greasy and dirty its metallic elements
 

00:09:20.429 --> 00:09:23.269
greasy and dirty its metallic elements
definitely more pop so there's our

00:09:23.269 --> 00:09:23.279
definitely more pop so there's our
 

00:09:23.279 --> 00:09:30.019
definitely more pop so there's our
crappy glow that we started with and

00:09:30.019 --> 00:09:30.029
crappy glow that we started with and
 

00:09:30.029 --> 00:09:32.599
crappy glow that we started with and
that's what we ended up with also after

00:09:32.599 --> 00:09:32.609
that's what we ended up with also after
 

00:09:32.609 --> 00:09:34.669
that's what we ended up with also after
the footage you're about to see it's the

00:09:34.669 --> 00:09:34.679
the footage you're about to see it's the
 

00:09:34.679 --> 00:09:36.499
the footage you're about to see it's the
exit video as you can see on the end

00:09:36.499 --> 00:09:36.509
exit video as you can see on the end
 

00:09:36.509 --> 00:09:38.479
exit video as you can see on the end
here with my explanation it definitely

00:09:38.479 --> 00:09:38.489
here with my explanation it definitely
 

00:09:38.489 --> 00:09:40.249
here with my explanation it definitely
looks a little shinier a little cleaner

00:09:40.249 --> 00:09:40.259
looks a little shinier a little cleaner
 

00:09:40.259 --> 00:09:42.559
looks a little shinier a little cleaner
I wanted to do a little bit more and

00:09:42.559 --> 00:09:42.569
I wanted to do a little bit more and
 

00:09:42.569 --> 00:09:44.689
I wanted to do a little bit more and
dirty it up so so basically this is the

00:09:44.689 --> 00:09:44.699
dirty it up so so basically this is the
 

00:09:44.699 --> 00:09:50.070
dirty it up so so basically this is the
final product

00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:50.080
 

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:53.590

copper kind of a look at least it looks
 

00:09:59.930 --> 00:10:02.560

more metallic I think I would probably

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:02.570
more metallic I think I would probably
 

00:10:02.570 --> 00:10:04.510
more metallic I think I would probably
still dirty it up a little bit I

00:10:04.510 --> 00:10:04.520
still dirty it up a little bit I
 

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:07.720
still dirty it up a little bit I
probably do another wash and then the

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:07.730
probably do another wash and then the
 

00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:10.360

the blades I just gave a dusting of a
 

00:10:10.370 --> 00:10:12.220
the blades I just gave a dusting of a
metallic so it's still a little bit of

00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:12.230
metallic so it's still a little bit of
 

00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:14.530
metallic so it's still a little bit of
black flecks that are kind of underneath

00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:14.540
black flecks that are kind of underneath
 

00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:17.170
black flecks that are kind of underneath
there but when the light hits it it

00:10:17.170 --> 00:10:17.180
there but when the light hits it it
 

00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:18.730
