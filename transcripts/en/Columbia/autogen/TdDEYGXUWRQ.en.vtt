okay good afternoon I remembered to

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210
okay good afternoon I remembered to
 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.200
okay good afternoon I remembered to
answer two questions that someone had

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210
answer two questions that someone had
 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.359
answer two questions that someone had
asked before you had asked about how

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369
asked before you had asked about how
 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.490
asked before you had asked about how
does West Nile get transmitted between

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500
does West Nile get transmitted between
 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.779
does West Nile get transmitted between
birds and I asked Dixon de Pommier who's

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789
birds and I asked Dixon de Pommier who's
 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.450
birds and I asked Dixon de Pommier who's
the expert and he said birds are very

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460
the expert and he said birds are very
 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.950
the expert and he said birds are very
social and they have virus in saliva so

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960
social and they have virus in saliva so
 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.209
social and they have virus in saliva so
that's how it goes from bird to bird he

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219
that's how it goes from bird to bird he
 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:33.410
that's how it goes from bird to bird he
said they've done experiments where

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420
said they've done experiments where
 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.660
said they've done experiments where
they'll put birds in a closed room and

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670
they'll put birds in a closed room and
 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.310
they'll put birds in a closed room and
they'll put some infected birds and some

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320
they'll put some infected birds and some
 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.740
they'll put some infected birds and some
uninfected and they readily transmit it

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750
uninfected and they readily transmit it
 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.530
uninfected and they readily transmit it
okay so that was one the other question

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540
okay so that was one the other question
 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.569
okay so that was one the other question
someone asked me is it true that they

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579
someone asked me is it true that they
 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.729
someone asked me is it true that they
put shrimp in the water to get rid of

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739
put shrimp in the water to get rid of
 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.670
put shrimp in the water to get rid of
the mosquitoes so they don't transmit

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680
the mosquitoes so they don't transmit
 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:50.420

I asked Dixon de Paume yay also and he

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289
I asked Dixon de Paume yay also and he
 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.130
I asked Dixon de Paume yay also and he
said shrimp don't eat mosquitoes they're

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140
said shrimp don't eat mosquitoes they're
 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.889

vegetarians all right so the answer to

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899
vegetarians all right so the answer to
 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.060
vegetarians all right so the answer to
that whoever asked me that I don't

okay so viruses are major causes of

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340
okay so viruses are major causes of
 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.259
okay so viruses are major causes of
liver cancer and cervical cancer now the

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:16.269
liver cancer and cervical cancer now the
 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:18.689
liver cancer and cervical cancer now the
point here to remember is that when

00:03:18.689 --> 00:03:18.699
point here to remember is that when
 

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:22.050
point here to remember is that when
viruses cause tumors they don't need to

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060

which not only cause tumors in humans
 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.670
which not only cause tumors in humans
but other animals as well so we have

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680

00:12:12.119 --> 00:12:14.210
sometimes it's not we can't make any
sense of this but you'll see how that is

00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:14.220
sense of this but you'll see how that is
 

00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:19.009
sense of this but you'll see how that is
explained in a few moments so if the

00:12:19.009 --> 00:12:19.019
explained in a few moments so if the
 

00:12:19.019 --> 00:12:20.749
explained in a few moments so if the
transforming infection is not a latent

00:12:20.749 --> 00:12:20.759
transforming infection is not a latent
 

00:12:20.759 --> 00:12:22.340
transforming infection is not a latent
infection remember a latent infection is

00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:22.350
infection remember a latent infection is
 

00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:23.840
infection remember a latent infection is
one where the virus infects you make

00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:23.850
one where the virus infects you make
 

00:12:23.850 --> 00:12:25.939
one where the virus infects you make
some virions then no virions are present

00:12:25.939 --> 00:12:25.949
some virions then no virions are present
 

00:12:25.949 --> 00:12:27.590
some virions then no virions are present
then later on at some insult they make

00:12:27.590 --> 00:12:27.600
then later on at some insult they make
 

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:28.460
then later on at some insult they make
more virions

00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:28.470
more virions
 

00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:30.290
more virions
then they turn it off so the whole

00:12:30.290 --> 00:12:30.300
then they turn it off so the whole
 

00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:32.030
then they turn it off so the whole
genome is there so it can make very ons

00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:32.040
genome is there so it can make very ons
 

00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:34.819
genome is there so it can make very ons
like herpes simplex type one but this is

00:12:34.819 --> 00:12:34.829
like herpes simplex type one but this is
 

00:12:34.829 --> 00:12:36.079
like herpes simplex type one but this is
not the case with this because they

00:12:36.079 --> 00:12:36.089
not the case with this because they
 

00:12:36.089 --> 00:12:37.939
not the case with this because they
typically don't have but make virus and

00:12:37.939 --> 00:12:37.949
typically don't have but make virus and
 

00:12:37.949 --> 00:12:39.439
typically don't have but make virus and
they don't even have the complete genome

00:12:39.439 --> 00:12:39.449
they don't even have the complete genome
 

00:12:39.449 --> 00:12:42.739
they don't even have the complete genome
so they can't make virus so what's going

00:12:42.739 --> 00:12:42.749
so they can't make virus so what's going
 

00:12:42.749 --> 00:12:44.299
so they can't make virus so what's going
on here is we're gonna talk about now

00:12:44.299 --> 00:12:44.309
on here is we're gonna talk about now
 

00:12:44.309 --> 00:12:47.119
on here is we're gonna talk about now
for the next 15 minutes or so I want to

00:12:47.119 --> 00:12:47.129
for the next 15 minutes or so I want to
 

00:12:47.129 --> 00:12:49.759
for the next 15 minutes or so I want to
explain that to you and this whole route

00:12:49.759 --> 00:12:49.769
explain that to you and this whole route
 

00:12:49.769 --> 00:12:52.460
explain that to you and this whole route
of understanding how viruses transform

00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:52.470
of understanding how viruses transform
 

00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:55.249
of understanding how viruses transform
cells took a long time starting from the

00:12:55.249 --> 00:12:55.259
cells took a long time starting from the
 

00:12:55.259 --> 00:12:57.230
cells took a long time starting from the
1909 experiment that we talked about

00:12:57.230 --> 00:12:57.240
1909 experiment that we talked about
 

00:12:57.240 --> 00:13:00.980
1909 experiment that we talked about
with retroviruses and we'll talk about

00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:00.990
with retroviruses and we'll talk about
 

00:13:00.990 --> 00:13:02.989
with retroviruses and we'll talk about
the studies through the 50s there was

00:13:02.989 --> 00:13:02.999
the studies through the 50s there was
 

00:13:02.999 --> 00:13:05.509
the studies through the 50s there was
also at the same time in vitro cancer

00:13:05.509 --> 00:13:05.519
also at the same time in vitro cancer
 

00:13:05.519 --> 00:13:06.949
also at the same time in vitro cancer
biology studies people were trying to

00:13:06.949 --> 00:13:06.959
biology studies people were trying to
 

00:13:06.959 --> 00:13:09.259
biology studies people were trying to
understand how cancer arose and then

00:13:09.259 --> 00:13:09.269
understand how cancer arose and then
 

00:13:09.269 --> 00:13:11.900
understand how cancer arose and then
beginning in the 1920s the studies on

00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:11.910
beginning in the 1920s the studies on
 

00:13:11.910 --> 00:13:13.939
beginning in the 1920s the studies on
transforming DNA viruses and at one

00:13:13.939 --> 00:13:13.949
transforming DNA viruses and at one
 

00:13:13.949 --> 00:13:15.799
transforming DNA viruses and at one
point all these converges in the 60s and

00:13:15.799 --> 00:13:15.809
point all these converges in the 60s and
 

00:13:15.809 --> 00:13:18.679
point all these converges in the 60s and
70s to give us our present theory of not

00:13:18.679 --> 00:13:18.689
70s to give us our present theory of not
 

00:13:18.689 --> 00:13:20.749
70s to give us our present theory of not
only transformation but growth control

00:13:20.749 --> 00:13:20.759
only transformation but growth control
 

00:13:20.759 --> 00:13:22.639
only transformation but growth control
all of these studies make it made it

00:13:22.639 --> 00:13:22.649
all of these studies make it made it
 

00:13:22.649 --> 00:13:25.340
all of these studies make it made it
really clear to us how growth in cells

00:13:25.340 --> 00:13:25.350
really clear to us how growth in cells
 

00:13:25.350 --> 00:13:28.629
really clear to us how growth in cells
is controlled so let's start here with

00:13:28.629 --> 00:13:28.639
is controlled so let's start here with
 

00:13:28.639 --> 00:13:31.249
is controlled so let's start here with

transform cells according to Howard

00:13:35.749 --> 00:13:35.759
transform cells according to Howard
 

00:13:35.759 --> 00:13:39.199

know all of this but what you don't know
 

00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:15.230
know all of this but what you don't know
is that most chickens are infected with

00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:15.240
is that most chickens are infected with
 

00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:17.569
is that most chickens are infected with
this virus within a few months of

00:14:17.569 --> 00:14:17.579
this virus within a few months of
 

00:14:17.579 --> 00:14:22.519
this virus within a few months of
hatching and this the disease that

00:14:22.519 --> 00:14:22.529
hatching and this the disease that
 

00:14:22.529 --> 00:14:24.560
hatching and this the disease that
results called Lu kosis or leukemia

00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:24.570
results called Lu kosis or leukemia
 

00:14:24.570 --> 00:14:26.870
results called Lu kosis or leukemia
that's where the name comes from Lu

00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:26.880
that's where the name comes from Lu
 

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:28.970
that's where the name comes from Lu
kosis another name for leukemia occurs

00:14:28.970 --> 00:14:28.980
kosis another name for leukemia occurs
 

00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:31.340
kosis another name for leukemia occurs
sporadically in infected birds once they

00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:31.350
sporadically in infected birds once they
 

00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:34.579
sporadically in infected birds once they
are older than 14 weeks it's about 3%

00:14:34.579 --> 00:14:34.589
are older than 14 weeks it's about 3%
 

00:14:34.589 --> 00:14:36.980
are older than 14 weeks it's about 3%
incidents in a flock they get to keep

00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:36.990
incidents in a flock they get to keep
 

00:14:36.990 --> 00:14:40.819
incidents in a flock they get to keep
leukemia the other 97% of the birds they

00:14:40.819 --> 00:14:40.829
leukemia the other 97% of the birds they
 

00:14:40.829 --> 00:14:43.160
leukemia the other 97% of the birds they
make a little virus they have an immune

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:43.170
make a little virus they have an immune
 

00:14:43.170 --> 00:14:45.230
make a little virus they have an immune
response they clear the virus and that's

00:14:45.230 --> 00:14:45.240
response they clear the virus and that's
 

00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:47.960
response they clear the virus and that's
the end of that so this is a very slow

00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:47.970
the end of that so this is a very slow
 

00:14:47.970 --> 00:14:50.300
the end of that so this is a very slow
disease to develop it's not an acute

00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:50.310
disease to develop it's not an acute
 

00:14:50.310 --> 00:14:53.499
disease to develop it's not an acute
disease and it is not a solid tumor

00:14:53.499 --> 00:14:53.509
disease and it is not a solid tumor
 

00:14:53.509 --> 00:14:56.930
disease and it is not a solid tumor
leukemia is of course a tumor of white

00:14:56.930 --> 00:14:56.940
leukemia is of course a tumor of white
 

00:14:56.940 --> 00:14:58.699
leukemia is of course a tumor of white
blood cells but it doesn't form a solid

00:14:58.699 --> 00:14:58.709
blood cells but it doesn't form a solid
 

00:14:58.709 --> 00:15:01.430

viruses infect all chickens and this is

00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:09.420
viruses infect all chickens and this is
 

00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:10.819
viruses infect all chickens and this is
the this is the pathology or the

00:15:10.819 --> 00:15:10.829
the this is the pathology or the
 

00:15:10.829 --> 00:15:14.329
the this is the pathology or the
pathogenesis now as these birds age if

00:15:14.329 --> 00:15:14.339
pathogenesis now as these birds age if
 

00:15:14.339 --> 00:15:16.490
pathogenesis now as these birds age if
you live on a farm with lots of birds

00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:16.500
you live on a farm with lots of birds
 

00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:19.460
you live on a farm with lots of birds
you will see other rare cancers occur

00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:19.470
you will see other rare cancers occur
 

00:15:19.470 --> 00:15:20.990
you will see other rare cancers occur
you have enough birds you're going to

00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:21.000
you have enough birds you're going to
 

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.379
you have enough birds you're going to
see these rare cancers and they're often

00:15:23.379 --> 00:15:23.389
see these rare cancers and they're often
 

00:15:23.389 --> 00:15:25.970
see these rare cancers and they're often
tumors of connective tissue which is a

00:15:25.970 --> 00:15:25.980
tumors of connective tissue which is a
 

00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:27.920
tumors of connective tissue which is a
sarcoma and of course that's what rouse

00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:27.930
sarcoma and of course that's what rouse
 

00:15:27.930 --> 00:15:29.990
sarcoma and of course that's what rouse
studied Rous sarcoma virus these are

00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:30.000
studied Rous sarcoma virus these are
 

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.290
studied Rous sarcoma virus these are
solid tumors so what's the relationship

00:15:33.290 --> 00:15:33.300
solid tumors so what's the relationship
 

00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:36.319
solid tumors so what's the relationship
if you isolate virus from these solid

00:15:36.319 --> 00:15:36.329
if you isolate virus from these solid
 

00:15:36.329 --> 00:15:38.300
if you isolate virus from these solid
tumors and re-inject them into chicken

00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:38.310
tumors and re-inject them into chicken
 

00:15:38.310 --> 00:15:40.210
tumors and re-inject them into chicken
they cause solid tumors they don't cause

00:15:40.210 --> 00:15:40.220
they cause solid tumors they don't cause
 

00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:43.460
they cause solid tumors they don't cause
leukemias and chicken and when they do

00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:43.470
leukemias and chicken and when they do
 

00:15:43.470 --> 00:15:45.319
leukemias and chicken and when they do
cause these solid tumors they do so

00:15:45.319 --> 00:15:45.329
cause these solid tumors they do so
 

00:15:45.329 --> 00:15:48.259
cause these solid tumors they do so
rapidly and that's the virus that rouse

00:15:48.259 --> 00:15:48.269
rapidly and that's the virus that rouse
 

00:15:48.269 --> 00:15:52.280
rapidly and that's the virus that rouse
isolated Rous sarcoma virus it he got it

so the retroviral genomes which you can

00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:16.610
so the retroviral genomes which you can
 

00:19:16.610 --> 00:19:18.610
so the retroviral genomes which you can
isolate from each tumor so you get

00:19:18.610 --> 00:19:18.620
isolate from each tumor so you get
 

00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:20.230
isolate from each tumor so you get

these cellular oncogenes that's really
 

00:20:59.809 --> 00:21:01.360
these cellular oncogenes that's really
important so they can't replicate on

00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:01.370

these viruses to replicate you have to

00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:06.350
these viruses to replicate you have to
 

00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:09.490
these viruses to replicate you have to
mix them with al V and infect the cell

00:21:09.490 --> 00:21:09.500
mix them with al V and infect the cell
 

00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:12.490
mix them with al V and infect the cell
and then they will replicate so that's

00:21:12.490 --> 00:21:12.500
and then they will replicate so that's
 

00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:14.049
and then they will replicate so that's
why we call these defective so you see

00:21:14.049 --> 00:21:14.059
why we call these defective so you see
 

00:21:14.059 --> 00:21:16.539
why we call these defective so you see

okay so different species can do this so
that's what these viruses have done they

00:22:07.810 --> 00:22:07.820
that's what these viruses have done they
 

00:22:07.820 --> 00:22:10.389
that's what these viruses have done they
picked up cellular sequences and that

00:22:10.389 --> 00:22:10.399
picked up cellular sequences and that
 

00:22:10.399 --> 00:22:12.970
picked up cellular sequences and that
was that is what make them transform now

00:22:12.970 --> 00:22:12.980
was that is what make them transform now
 

00:22:12.980 --> 00:22:15.070
was that is what make them transform now
don't get the impression that all

about last time

00:22:20.889 --> 00:22:20.899
about last time
 

00:22:20.899 --> 00:22:22.899
about last time
these are cytopathic they kill cells

00:22:22.899 --> 00:22:22.909
these are cytopathic they kill cells
 

00:22:22.909 --> 00:22:25.029
these are cytopathic they kill cells
they cannot transform them because they

00:22:25.029 --> 00:22:25.039
they cannot transform them because they
 

00:22:25.039 --> 00:22:26.950
they cannot transform them because they
kill them but the viruses we've talked

00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:26.960
kill them but the viruses we've talked
 

00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:29.740
kill them but the viruses we've talked
about rouse ALS and in the mouse

00:22:29.740 --> 00:22:29.750
about rouse ALS and in the mouse
 

00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:31.690
about rouse ALS and in the mouse
leukemia viruses they do not kill cells

00:22:31.690 --> 00:22:31.700
leukemia viruses they do not kill cells
 

00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:33.580
leukemia viruses they do not kill cells
so they have the potential to transform

00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:33.590
so they have the potential to transform
 

00:22:33.590 --> 00:22:37.450
so they have the potential to transform
them the other thing which to clarify

00:22:37.450 --> 00:22:37.460
them the other thing which to clarify
 

00:22:37.460 --> 00:22:40.000
them the other thing which to clarify
for you if you don't understand the idea

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:40.010
for you if you don't understand the idea
 

00:22:40.010 --> 00:22:42.100
for you if you don't understand the idea
of defective versus non defective

00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:42.110
of defective versus non defective
 

00:22:42.110 --> 00:22:44.049
of defective versus non defective
retroviruses one more time a defective

00:22:44.049 --> 00:22:44.059
retroviruses one more time a defective
 

00:22:44.059 --> 00:22:46.149
retroviruses one more time a defective
virus is missing some part of the genome

00:22:46.149 --> 00:22:46.159
virus is missing some part of the genome
 

00:22:46.159 --> 00:22:47.889
virus is missing some part of the genome
so it needs a helper to produce that

00:22:47.889 --> 00:22:47.899
so it needs a helper to produce that
 

00:22:47.899 --> 00:22:50.500
so it needs a helper to produce that
part in order to produce more virus and

00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:50.510
part in order to produce more virus and
 

00:22:50.510 --> 00:22:52.149
part in order to produce more virus and
typically these viruses are missing

00:22:52.149 --> 00:22:52.159
typically these viruses are missing
 

00:22:52.159 --> 00:22:55.000
typically these viruses are missing
envelope glycoproteins and these get

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:55.010
envelope glycoproteins and these get
 

00:22:55.010 --> 00:22:57.009
envelope glycoproteins and these get
deleted during the process of oncogene

00:22:57.009 --> 00:22:57.019
deleted during the process of oncogene
 

00:22:57.019 --> 00:23:00.090
deleted during the process of oncogene
capture and that's why they're defective

00:23:00.090 --> 00:23:00.100
capture and that's why they're defective
 

00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:03.440
capture and that's why they're defective
now this slide shows

00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:03.450
now this slide shows
 

00:23:03.450 --> 00:23:06.080
now this slide shows
two mechanisms for the capture of

00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:06.090
two mechanisms for the capture of
 

00:23:06.090 --> 00:23:11.110
two mechanisms for the capture of
oncogenes by viruses I don't want you to

00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:11.120
oncogenes by viruses I don't want you to
 

00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:14.180
oncogenes by viruses I don't want you to
learn this it is just to show you

00:23:14.180 --> 00:23:14.190
learn this it is just to show you
 

00:23:14.190 --> 00:23:15.409
learn this it is just to show you
because I'm sure you're thinking how

00:23:15.409 --> 00:23:15.419
because I'm sure you're thinking how
 

00:23:15.419 --> 00:23:17.509
because I'm sure you're thinking how
does a virus capture an oncogene we

00:23:17.509 --> 00:23:17.519
does a virus capture an oncogene we
 

00:23:17.519 --> 00:23:19.249
does a virus capture an oncogene we
don't really understand but there's

00:23:19.249 --> 00:23:19.259
don't really understand but there's
 

00:23:19.259 --> 00:23:21.430
don't really understand but there's
there two hypotheses shown here and

00:23:21.430 --> 00:23:21.440
there two hypotheses shown here and
 

00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:23.919
there two hypotheses shown here and
since the neither have been proven

00:23:23.919 --> 00:23:23.929
since the neither have been proven
 

00:23:23.929 --> 00:23:25.940
since the neither have been proven
there's no need for you to understand

there's no need for you to understand
 

00:23:25.950 --> 00:23:28.580
there's no need for you to understand
but basically you remember that viral

but basically you remember that viral
 

00:23:28.590 --> 00:23:30.739
but basically you remember that viral
DNA integrates into the DNA of the host

00:23:30.739 --> 00:23:30.749
DNA integrates into the DNA of the host
 

00:23:30.749 --> 00:23:34.759
DNA integrates into the DNA of the host
cell and it does so almost randomly and

kick that cell to divide uncontrollably

00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:46.320
kick that cell to divide uncontrollably
 

00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:49.039
kick that cell to divide uncontrollably
under certain conditions and when I

retrovirus integrate next to one of
 

00:23:55.320 --> 00:23:57.950
retrovirus integrate next to one of
these oncogenes and then when the viral

these oncogenes and then when the viral
 

00:23:57.960 --> 00:24:00.230

RNA is produced sometimes it's just

00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:00.240

rarely the polymerase may transcribe the
 

00:24:05.850 --> 00:24:07.730
rarely the polymerase may transcribe the
the downstream oncogene which is what

the downstream oncogene which is what
 

00:24:07.740 --> 00:24:10.129
the downstream oncogene which is what
you see here this will then get packaged

00:24:10.129 --> 00:24:10.139
you see here this will then get packaged
 

00:24:10.139 --> 00:24:12.649
you see here this will then get packaged
into the virus particle so now you have

00:24:12.649 --> 00:24:12.659
into the virus particle so now you have
 

00:24:12.659 --> 00:24:15.190
into the virus particle so now you have
one RNA with a little bit of oncogene

00:24:15.190 --> 00:24:15.200
one RNA with a little bit of oncogene
 

00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:17.960

and then during infection of the new
 

00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:21.649
and then during infection of the new
cell what we think is that there's some

00:24:21.649 --> 00:24:21.659
cell what we think is that there's some
 

00:24:21.659 --> 00:24:23.749
cell what we think is that there's some
recombination events that occur which

okay so starting from this original

00:24:37.639 --> 00:24:37.649
okay so starting from this original
 

00:24:37.649 --> 00:24:40.549
okay so starting from this original
integration event you have production of

00:24:40.549 --> 00:24:40.559
integration event you have production of
 

00:24:40.559 --> 00:24:42.139
integration event you have production of
new virus particles that carry an

00:24:42.139 --> 00:24:42.149
new virus particles that carry an
 

00:24:42.149 --> 00:24:44.480
new virus particles that carry an

that oncogene is transmitted now
sometimes what happens is additional

00:24:49.669 --> 00:24:49.679
sometimes what happens is additional
 

00:24:49.679 --> 00:24:52.310
sometimes what happens is additional
mutations or changes occur in this

00:24:52.310 --> 00:24:52.320
mutations or changes occur in this
 

00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:53.749
mutations or changes occur in this
oncogene and for some of the

00:24:53.749 --> 00:24:53.759
oncogene and for some of the
 

00:24:53.759 --> 00:24:55.700
oncogene and for some of the
retroviruses this is very important so

00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:55.710
retroviruses this is very important so
 

00:24:55.710 --> 00:24:57.320
retroviruses this is very important so
you can see this light colored sequence

00:24:57.320 --> 00:24:57.330
you can see this light colored sequence
 

00:24:57.330 --> 00:24:59.330
you can see this light colored sequence
here on the bottom means that the

00:24:59.330 --> 00:24:59.340
here on the bottom means that the
 

00:24:59.340 --> 00:25:02.389
here on the bottom means that the
original monka gene has changed in some

00:25:02.389 --> 00:25:02.399
original monka gene has changed in some
 

00:25:02.399 --> 00:25:18.230
original monka gene has changed in some
way so in some in many yes

00:25:18.230 --> 00:25:18.240
 
 

00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:21.030
 
it is not it does not happen all the

it is not it does not happen all the
 

00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:23.700
it is not it does not happen all the

00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:23.710
time it's a relatively rare event which
 

00:25:23.710 --> 00:25:26.700
time it's a relatively rare event which
is why transformation it took the

transforming virus is a rare event and

00:25:30.690 --> 00:25:30.700
transforming virus is a rare event and
 

00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:33.060
transforming virus is a rare event and
that probably reflects that this

00:25:33.060 --> 00:25:33.070
that probably reflects that this
 

00:25:33.070 --> 00:25:34.560
that probably reflects that this

00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:34.570
read-through doesn't occur all the time
 

00:25:34.570 --> 00:25:37.110
read-through doesn't occur all the time
and because because the LTR the virus

00:25:37.110 --> 00:25:37.120
and because because the LTR the virus

these oncogenes picked up by
retroviruses so oncogenes in the virus

00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:42.430
retroviruses so oncogenes in the virus
 

00:26:42.430 --> 00:26:44.940
retroviruses so oncogenes in the virus
now our mutant proto-oncogene the

00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:44.950
now our mutant proto-oncogene the
 

00:26:44.950 --> 00:26:46.590
now our mutant proto-oncogene the
proto-oncogene is what is in the cell

the retrovirus picks it up and now
 

00:26:48.580 --> 00:26:53.460
the retrovirus picks it up and now
becomes a Honka gene so basically if a

becomes a Honka gene so basically if a
 

00:26:53.470 --> 00:26:55.590

proto-oncogene is either expressed at
 

00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:58.200
proto-oncogene is either expressed at
the wrong time or if they are mutated so

00:26:58.200 --> 00:26:58.210
the wrong time or if they are mutated so
 

00:26:58.210 --> 00:27:00.960
the wrong time or if they are mutated so
that they are on or off the cell grows

00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:00.970
that they are on or off the cell grows
 

00:27:00.970 --> 00:27:03.330
that they are on or off the cell grows
without regulation so now the virus has

00:27:03.330 --> 00:27:03.340
without regulation so now the virus has
 

00:27:03.340 --> 00:27:05.610

since there's some Celgene that's gone

00:27:25.030 --> 00:27:25.040
since there's some Celgene that's gone
 

00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:26.380
since there's some Celgene that's gone
wrong but they didn't have any evidence

00:27:26.380 --> 00:27:26.390
wrong but they didn't have any evidence
 

00:27:26.390 --> 00:27:28.330
wrong but they didn't have any evidence
for it and viruses gave them that

00:27:28.330 --> 00:27:28.340
for it and viruses gave them that
 

00:27:28.340 --> 00:27:31.090
for it and viruses gave them that
evidence so proto-oncogenes are found in

00:27:31.090 --> 00:27:31.100
evidence so proto-oncogenes are found in
 

00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:32.620
evidence so proto-oncogenes are found in
all cell and there can involve din the

growth factors work via receptors the

00:28:39.010 --> 00:28:39.020
growth factors work via receptors the
 

00:28:39.020 --> 00:28:40.900
growth factors work via receptors the
growth factor binds a receptor and

00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:40.910
growth factor binds a receptor and
 

00:28:40.910 --> 00:28:43.480

and finally there are tumor suppressor

00:29:13.510 --> 00:29:13.520
and finally there are tumor suppressor
 

00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:15.930
and finally there are tumor suppressor
genes these are genes that are negative

00:29:15.930 --> 00:29:15.940
genes these are genes that are negative
 

00:29:15.940 --> 00:29:18.970
genes these are genes that are negative
regulators of cell growth now these are

00:29:18.970 --> 00:29:18.980
regulators of cell growth now these are
 

00:29:18.980 --> 00:29:20.919
regulators of cell growth now these are
not picked up by retroviruses these were

00:29:20.919 --> 00:29:20.929
not picked up by retroviruses these were
 

00:29:20.929 --> 00:29:23.350
not picked up by retroviruses these were
identified in the DNA tumor viruses

00:29:23.350 --> 00:29:23.360

00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:25.570
identified in the DNA tumor viruses
which we will see so these four classes

00:29:25.570 --> 00:29:25.580
which we will see so these four classes
 

00:29:25.580 --> 00:29:28.299
which we will see so these four classes
were picked up in retrovirus so this

00:29:28.299 --> 00:29:28.309
were picked up in retrovirus so this
 

00:29:28.309 --> 00:29:30.880
were picked up in retrovirus so this
defines a signaling cascade from the

00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:30.890
defines a signaling cascade from the
 

00:29:30.890 --> 00:29:32.990
defines a signaling cascade from the

works

00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:43.290
works
 

00:29:43.290 --> 00:29:46.940
works
so here all the so you basically can

00:29:46.940 --> 00:29:46.950
so here all the so you basically can
 

00:29:46.950 --> 00:29:49.520
so here all the so you basically can
make an oncogene out of any of these

00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:49.530
make an oncogene out of any of these
 

00:29:49.530 --> 00:29:51.800
make an oncogene out of any of these
components of this signaling pathway so

00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:51.810
components of this signaling pathway so
 

00:29:51.810 --> 00:29:54.560
components of this signaling pathway so
growth factors we know of oncogenes that

00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:54.570
growth factors we know of oncogenes that
 

00:29:54.570 --> 00:29:57.170
growth factors we know of oncogenes that
are growth factors the receptors for

00:29:57.170 --> 00:29:57.180
are growth factors the receptors for
 

00:29:57.180 --> 00:29:59.300
are growth factors the receptors for
these growth factors we know a number

00:29:59.300 --> 00:29:59.310
these growth factors we know a number
 

00:29:59.310 --> 00:30:01.190
these growth factors we know a number
which are also all genes they've been

00:30:01.190 --> 00:30:01.200
which are also all genes they've been
 

00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:03.410
which are also all genes they've been
picked up by retroviruses and can

00:30:03.410 --> 00:30:03.420
picked up by retroviruses and can
 

00:30:03.420 --> 00:30:06.350

cytoplasmic protein kinases and finally

00:30:13.060 --> 00:30:13.070
cytoplasmic protein kinases and finally
 

00:30:13.070 --> 00:30:14.780
cytoplasmic protein kinases and finally
transcriptional regulators in the

00:30:14.780 --> 00:30:14.790
transcriptional regulators in the
 

00:30:14.790 --> 00:30:17.840
transcriptional regulators in the
nucleus so again this is a pathway that

00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:17.850
nucleus so again this is a pathway that
 

00:30:17.850 --> 00:30:20.390
nucleus so again this is a pathway that
tells the cell to divide there's a

00:30:20.390 --> 00:30:20.400
tells the cell to divide there's a
 

00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:22.400
tells the cell to divide there's a
growth factor present the binds a

00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:22.410
growth factor present the binds a
 

00:30:22.410 --> 00:30:24.950
growth factor present the binds a
receptor and it starts this signaling

00:30:24.950 --> 00:30:24.960
receptor and it starts this signaling
 

00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:28.040
receptor and it starts this signaling
cascade the cell eventually divides and

00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:28.050
cascade the cell eventually divides and
 

00:30:28.050 --> 00:30:30.200
cascade the cell eventually divides and
this is this cascade is divided into

00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:30.210
this is this cascade is divided into
 

00:30:30.210 --> 00:30:31.820
this is this cascade is divided into
discrete steps there are proteins at

00:30:31.820 --> 00:30:31.830
discrete steps there are proteins at
 

00:30:31.830 --> 00:30:33.910
discrete steps there are proteins at
every step that have a function and

00:30:33.910 --> 00:30:33.920
every step that have a function and
 

00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:36.380
every step that have a function and
retroviruses can pick up any of these

00:30:36.380 --> 00:30:36.390
retroviruses can pick up any of these
 

00:30:36.390 --> 00:30:39.560
retroviruses can pick up any of these
genes and alter them in a certain way

00:30:39.560 --> 00:30:39.570
genes and alter them in a certain way
 

00:30:39.570 --> 00:30:42.500
genes and alter them in a certain way
such that they're always active and when

00:30:42.500 --> 00:30:42.510
such that they're always active and when
 

00:30:42.510 --> 00:30:43.970
such that they're always active and when
they reintroduce into the cell by the

00:30:43.970 --> 00:30:43.980
they reintroduce into the cell by the
 

00:30:43.980 --> 00:30:45.470
they reintroduce into the cell by the
retrovirus the cell divides

00:30:45.470 --> 00:30:45.480
retrovirus the cell divides
 

00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:47.840
retrovirus the cell divides
uncontrollably so for example you don't

00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:47.850
uncontrollably so for example you don't
 

00:30:47.850 --> 00:30:49.670
uncontrollably so for example you don't
have growth factors around all the time

00:30:49.670 --> 00:30:49.680
have growth factors around all the time
 

00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:53.780
have growth factors around all the time
but with a mutant growth factor brought

00:30:53.780 --> 00:30:53.790
but with a mutant growth factor brought
 

00:30:53.790 --> 00:30:55.520
but with a mutant growth factor brought
in by retrovirus you do you have a

00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:55.530
in by retrovirus you do you have a
 

00:30:55.530 --> 00:30:57.350
in by retrovirus you do you have a
growth factor present all the time and

00:30:57.350 --> 00:30:57.360
growth factor present all the time and
 

00:30:57.360 --> 00:31:00.020
growth factor present all the time and
it's making the cells divide so that's

00:31:00.020 --> 00:31:00.030
it's making the cells divide so that's
 

00:31:00.030 --> 00:31:02.600
it's making the cells divide so that's
what transforms the cells uncontrolled

00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:02.610

genome but rather it makes a protein

00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:38.490
genome but rather it makes a protein
 

00:35:38.490 --> 00:35:41.810

that is a transcriptional activator that

00:35:41.810 --> 00:35:41.820
that is a transcriptional activator that
 

00:35:41.820 --> 00:35:44.210
that is a transcriptional activator that
then goes in the cell and activates the

00:35:44.210 --> 00:35:44.220
then goes in the cell and activates the
 

00:35:44.220 --> 00:35:46.940
then goes in the cell and activates the
production of growth factors that push

00:35:46.940 --> 00:35:46.950
production of growth factors that push
 

00:35:46.950 --> 00:35:49.400

so three mechanisms you inappropriately

00:35:52.610 --> 00:35:52.620
so three mechanisms you inappropriately
 

00:35:52.620 --> 00:35:55.850
so three mechanisms you inappropriately
express a growth control protein you

00:35:55.850 --> 00:35:55.860
express a growth control protein you
 

00:35:55.860 --> 00:35:57.980
express a growth control protein you

protein resulting in it's an appropriate
 

00:35:59.940 --> 00:36:02.060
protein resulting in it's an appropriate
expression or you make a protein that

00:36:02.060 --> 00:36:02.070
expression or you make a protein that
 

00:36:02.070 --> 00:36:04.910

which happened these monkeys happen to

00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:47.610
which happened these monkeys happen to
 

00:39:47.610 --> 00:39:50.150
which happened these monkeys happen to
be infected with sv40 and they showed

00:39:50.150 --> 00:39:50.160
be infected with sv40 and they showed
 

00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:52.280
be infected with sv40 and they showed
that these viruses these are monkey

transform monkey cells it will transform

00:40:23.690 --> 00:40:23.700
transform monkey cells it will transform
 

00:40:23.700 --> 00:40:27.530
transform monkey cells it will transform
other species of cells so really calling

00:40:27.530 --> 00:40:27.540
other species of cells so really calling
 

00:40:27.540 --> 00:40:29.990
other species of cells so really calling
it a tumor virus is a bit of a stretch

00:40:29.990 --> 00:40:30.000
it a tumor virus is a bit of a stretch
 

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:32.060
it a tumor virus is a bit of a stretch
because in its natural host it doesn't

00:40:32.060 --> 00:40:32.070
because in its natural host it doesn't
 

00:40:32.070 --> 00:40:34.190
because in its natural host it doesn't
cause tumors but it does cause tumors in

00:40:34.190 --> 00:40:34.200
cause tumors but it does cause tumors in
 

00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:35.740
cause tumors but it does cause tumors in
some animals so the name has stuck

00:43:38.170 --> 00:43:38.180
has also been informative in
 

00:43:38.180 --> 00:43:41.390
has also been informative in
understanding the basis of tumorigenesis

00:43:41.390 --> 00:43:41.400
understanding the basis of tumorigenesis
 

00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:43.520

and like Paulie OMA and papillomas these

00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:43.530
and like Paulie OMA and papillomas these
 

00:43:43.530 --> 00:43:48.290
and like Paulie OMA and papillomas these
are rare events only one focus when you

00:43:48.290 --> 00:43:48.300
are rare events only one focus when you
 

00:43:48.300 --> 00:43:50.480
are rare events only one focus when you
add a lot of virus to cells okay so

00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:50.490
add a lot of virus to cells okay so
 

00:43:50.490 --> 00:43:53.150
add a lot of virus to cells okay so
those are the three kinds of DNA tumor

00:43:53.150 --> 00:43:53.160
those are the three kinds of DNA tumor
 

00:43:53.160 --> 00:43:54.980

define what kinds of proteins are

00:44:17.720 --> 00:44:17.730
define what kinds of proteins are
 

00:44:17.730 --> 00:44:20.600
define what kinds of proteins are
present and in cells when you transform

00:44:20.600 --> 00:44:20.610
present and in cells when you transform
 

00:44:20.610 --> 00:44:22.070

cells with these virus they make the

00:44:22.070 --> 00:44:22.080
cells with these virus they make the
 

00:44:22.080 --> 00:44:23.870
cells with these virus they make the
same protein so they were called T

00:44:23.870 --> 00:44:23.880
same protein so they were called T
 

00:44:23.880 --> 00:44:26.510
same protein so they were called T
antigens or tumor antigens and you've

00:44:26.510 --> 00:44:26.520
antigens or tumor antigens and you've
 

00:44:26.520 --> 00:44:28.910

with these DNA viruses and look for

00:44:36.860 --> 00:44:36.870
with these DNA viruses and look for
 

00:44:36.870 --> 00:44:40.190
with these DNA viruses and look for
viral DNA what you find is that most of

00:44:40.190 --> 00:44:40.200
viral DNA what you find is that most of
 

00:44:40.200 --> 00:44:43.100

originally described as present in
 

00:44:50.610 --> 00:44:53.330
originally described as present in
tumors and transform cells so this is

00:44:53.330 --> 00:44:53.340
tumors and transform cells so this is
 

00:44:53.340 --> 00:44:55.040
tumors and transform cells so this is
very different from transformation by

00:44:55.040 --> 00:44:55.050
very different from transformation by
 

00:44:55.050 --> 00:44:57.590
very different from transformation by

these before sv40 poly Ouma there are a

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:11.010
these before sv40 poly Ouma there are a
 

00:45:11.010 --> 00:45:12.740
these before sv40 poly Ouma there are a
couple of different sizes there's large

00:45:12.740 --> 00:45:12.750
couple of different sizes there's large
 

00:45:12.750 --> 00:45:15.800

they're all dis sv40 and mouse versions
 

00:45:18.180 --> 00:45:18.830
they're all dis sv40 and mouse versions
are all different

00:45:18.830 --> 00:45:18.840
are all different
 

00:45:18.840 --> 00:45:21.380

previous lectures they're needed for
 

00:45:58.050 --> 00:46:00.140
previous lectures they're needed for
viral DNA synthesis and again they are

00:46:00.140 --> 00:46:00.150
viral DNA synthesis and again they are
 

00:46:00.150 --> 00:46:02.510
viral DNA synthesis and again they are
the only viral genes that are always

00:46:02.510 --> 00:46:02.520
the only viral genes that are always
 

00:46:02.520 --> 00:46:05.000
the only viral genes that are always
present in tumor cells either in an

animal or in a transformed cell in the

00:46:07.160 --> 00:46:07.170
animal or in a transformed cell in the
 

00:46:07.170 --> 00:46:09.050
animal or in a transformed cell in the
culture so the genes for the T engine

00:46:09.050 --> 00:46:09.060
culture so the genes for the T engine
 

00:46:09.060 --> 00:46:10.910
culture so the genes for the T engine
are the only ones that are consistently

00:46:10.910 --> 00:46:10.920
are the only ones that are consistently
 

00:46:10.920 --> 00:46:14.390
are the only ones that are consistently
present so why are they there are they

00:46:14.390 --> 00:46:14.400
present so why are they there are they
 

00:46:14.400 --> 00:46:16.340
present so why are they there are they
the cause of transformation or the

00:46:16.340 --> 00:46:16.350
the cause of transformation or the
 

00:46:16.350 --> 00:46:20.630

we put T antigen in them and it could

00:46:37.490 --> 00:46:37.500
we put T antigen in them and it could
 

00:46:37.500 --> 00:46:39.440
we put T antigen in them and it could
come from any of these viruses and those

00:46:39.440 --> 00:46:39.450
come from any of these viruses and those
 

00:46:39.450 --> 00:46:41.600

the DNA viruses no no we need to
 

00:58:01.880 --> 00:58:03.430
the DNA viruses no no we need to
replicate in these cells so they inhibit

00:58:03.430 --> 00:58:03.440
replicate in these cells so they inhibit
 

00:58:03.440 --> 00:58:09.970
replicate in these cells so they inhibit
apoptosis so that that is the link

okay so that's what the tea antigens do

00:58:26.720 --> 00:58:26.730
okay so that's what the tea antigens do
 

00:58:26.730 --> 00:58:30.260
okay so that's what the tea antigens do
they counter RB and they counter p53

00:58:30.260 --> 00:58:30.270
they counter RB and they counter p53
 

00:58:30.270 --> 00:58:33.140
they counter RB and they counter p53
which are both gatekeepers of the cell

viral genes except the T antigens
 

00:58:47.040 --> 00:58:50.200
viral genes except the T antigens
deleted or turned off and why is

00:58:55.069 --> 00:58:57.950
 
well transformation is rare because you

00:58:57.950 --> 00:58:57.960
well transformation is rare because you
 

00:58:57.960 --> 00:59:02.290
well transformation is rare because you

need to low probability events to occur
 

00:59:02.300 --> 00:59:05.720
need to low probability events to occur
first of all you can't express the

the genes that make capsids and cause
the cells to to lyse so you either have

00:59:15.500 --> 00:59:15.510
the cells to to lyse so you either have
 

00:59:15.510 --> 00:59:17.599
the cells to to lyse so you either have
to have a deletion of late genes or the

00:59:17.599 --> 00:59:17.609
to have a deletion of late genes or the
 

00:59:17.609 --> 00:59:20.240
to have a deletion of late genes or the
virus infect semi permissive cells where

00:59:20.240 --> 00:59:20.250
virus infect semi permissive cells where
 

00:59:20.250 --> 00:59:23.180
virus infect semi permissive cells where
late gene expression is blocked so now

00:59:23.180 --> 00:59:23.190
late gene expression is blocked so now
 

00:59:23.190 --> 00:59:24.589
late gene expression is blocked so now
you remember these viruses only

00:59:24.589 --> 00:59:24.599
you remember these viruses only
 

00:59:24.599 --> 00:59:27.740
you remember these viruses only
transform cells that are semi permissive

00:59:27.740 --> 00:59:27.750
transform cells that are semi permissive
 

00:59:27.750 --> 00:59:30.319
transform cells that are semi permissive
the wrong species and this is why

00:59:30.319 --> 00:59:30.329
the wrong species and this is why
 

00:59:30.329 --> 00:59:32.780
the wrong species and this is why
they're able to transform them because

00:59:32.780 --> 00:59:32.790
they're able to transform them because
 

00:59:32.790 --> 00:59:35.690
they're able to transform them because
they don't go into late viral DNA late

00:59:35.690 --> 00:59:35.700
they don't go into late viral DNA late
 

00:59:35.700 --> 00:59:38.539
they don't go into late viral DNA late
viral gene expression so the cells are

00:59:38.539 --> 00:59:38.549
viral gene expression so the cells are
 

00:59:38.549 --> 00:59:40.039
viral gene expression so the cells are
not killed and they can instead be

00:59:40.039 --> 00:59:40.049
not killed and they can instead be
 

00:59:40.049 --> 00:59:43.220
not killed and they can instead be
transformed in addition they have to

00:59:43.220 --> 00:59:43.230
transformed in addition they have to
 

00:59:43.230 --> 00:59:47.510
transformed in addition they have to
give T antigen to every cell that that

00:59:47.510 --> 00:59:47.520
give T antigen to every cell that that
 

00:59:47.520 --> 00:59:51.170
give T antigen to every cell that that
is produced from the original one so the

00:59:51.170 --> 00:59:51.180
is produced from the original one so the
 

00:59:51.180 --> 00:59:52.940
is produced from the original one so the
DNA encoding T antigen has to be

00:59:52.940 --> 00:59:52.950
DNA encoding T antigen has to be
 

00:59:52.950 --> 00:59:55.400
DNA encoding T antigen has to be
integrated into the host DNA so this is

00:59:55.400 --> 00:59:55.410
integrated into the host DNA so this is
 

00:59:55.410 --> 00:59:58.670
integrated into the host DNA so this is
also a rare event the integration of T

00:59:58.670 --> 00:59:58.680
also a rare event the integration of T
 

00:59:58.680 --> 01:00:00.349
also a rare event the integration of T
antigen because that has to be inherited

01:00:00.349 --> 01:00:00.359
antigen because that has to be inherited
 

01:00:00.359 --> 01:00:01.940
antigen because that has to be inherited
by all the subsequent cells because if

01:00:01.940 --> 01:00:01.950
by all the subsequent cells because if
 

01:00:01.950 --> 01:00:03.740
by all the subsequent cells because if
they don't have T antigen what is going

01:00:03.740 --> 01:00:03.750
they don't have T antigen what is going
 

01:00:03.750 --> 01:00:06.349
they don't have T antigen what is going
to happen are B and p53 are going to be

01:00:06.349 --> 01:00:06.359
to happen are B and p53 are going to be
 

01:00:06.359 --> 01:00:08.319
to happen are B and p53 are going to be
active again and they're going to stop

01:00:08.319 --> 01:00:08.329
active again and they're going to stop
 

01:00:08.329 --> 01:00:12.710
active again and they're going to stop
unscheduled entry into s okay so that's

01:00:12.710 --> 01:00:12.720
unscheduled entry into s okay so that's
 

01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:15.920
unscheduled entry into s okay so that's
why transformation is rare you can't

01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:15.930
why transformation is rare you can't
 

01:00:15.930 --> 01:00:18.020
why transformation is rare you can't
have lytic replication so you have to

01:00:18.020 --> 01:00:18.030
have lytic replication so you have to
 

01:00:18.030 --> 01:00:20.870
have lytic replication so you have to
transform only non-permissive cells you

01:00:20.870 --> 01:00:20.880
transform only non-permissive cells you
 

01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:23.420
transform only non-permissive cells you
have to prevent a late gene expression

01:00:23.420 --> 01:00:23.430
have to prevent a late gene expression
 

01:00:23.430 --> 01:00:26.390
have to prevent a late gene expression
and you have to have T antigen in every

01:00:26.390 --> 01:00:26.400
and you have to have T antigen in every

and when the right ones occur in the
 

01:04:48.610 --> 01:04:51.810
and when the right ones occur in the
right genes then the cell becomes a

01:04:51.810 --> 01:04:51.820
right genes then the cell becomes a

the virus has just started they're on

01:05:21.660 --> 01:05:21.670
the virus has just started they're on
 

01:05:21.670 --> 01:05:23.370
the virus has just started they're on
their way to becoming cancer cells so I

01:05:23.370 --> 01:05:23.380
their way to becoming cancer cells so I
 

01:05:23.380 --> 01:05:24.660
their way to becoming cancer cells so I
want you to also remember that it

01:05:24.660 --> 01:05:24.670
want you to also remember that it
 

01:05:24.670 --> 01:05:27.240
want you to also remember that it
transform cells not cancer cell the

01:05:27.240 --> 01:05:27.250
transform cells not cancer cell the
 

01:05:27.250 --> 01:05:37.870
transform cells not cancer cell the
virus just initiates this

01:05:37.870 --> 01:05:37.880
