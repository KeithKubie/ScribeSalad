&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So okay, so this is kind of a plastic material. You have sort of a, there's

00:00:04.219 --> 00:00:07.669
this guy who's kind of rubbery or, so what kind of materials are there? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; So

00:00:07.669 --> 00:00:11.479
there's lots of different kinds of 3D printing but right now you can almost

00:00:11.479 --> 00:00:14.996
three d print any material that you can think of. I've seen things that are

00:00:14.996 --> 00:00:18.196
bronze, we've done things out of different types of metals. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; All sorts of

00:00:18.196 --> 00:00:22.320
plastics. This one has a rubberized fading into a plastic texture. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Hm. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;

00:00:22.321 --> 00:00:26.525
Which is kind of crazy, so this is all one print also. And it has the rubber

00:00:26.525 --> 00:00:31.694
going right into the hard clear plastic, which is pretty crazy. This was also

00:00:31.694 --> 00:00:36.902
designed in a super easy program called 123 3D design that I mean, children

00:00:36.902 --> 00:00:40.026
could do it. I mean, all the parts are in there native and you just stick them

00:00:40.026 --> 00:00:42.930
together and this is what you get out at the end. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Uh-huh. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; You know, no

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.944
other time in history. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah right. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Could you ever put something together

00:00:45.944 --> 00:00:47.300
this quickly that of this caliber.
