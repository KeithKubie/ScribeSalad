00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.550
I'll speak from my perspective as a researcher
who works in robotics, machines, and manufacturing

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:06.550
systems.

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:13.080
But a lot of infrastructure gets developed
that is owned by specific entities.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.630
Like you have Boston Dynamics that does really
cool robots for example.

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.000
They don't release in the public domain how
to build their robots.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.960
You can buy a robot from them and use it as
a platform, but you can't BE the platform.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:37.300
And so at the same time, right now if you
look at deep learning frameworks, you have

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:44.800
CNTK from Microsoft, or TensorFlow from Google,
or any of the other ones.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.640
Which one is going to be the framework and
can you BE that framework, or do you just

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:49.790
have to buy into that system?

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:50.790
Are they a monopoly?

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:55.340
So if we all have to buy into TensorFlow,
which is owned by Alphabet/Google, then what

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:00.420
does that mean for what direction, what does
that mean for the politics of the infrastructure?

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:07.570
And I think that in the case of Boston Dynamics,
most of their funding came from federal agencies,

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.310
DARPA or the Department of Defense.

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.100
And so why is that infrastructure owned by
them?

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.240
Why is that platform owned by them?

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.710
In the case of Google, they're pouring in
their own resources to build their own platform.

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.860
So it makes sense that they want to retain
ownership over it.

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:29.270
But are there other places where researchers
like us can exercise insight into the design

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:34.790
of infrastructural systems such that they
remain democratic platforms, or become democratic

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:36.330
platforms?

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:42.540
If you're driving for Uber, you have to use
the Uber app, but can you also just fork the

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:43.540
Uber app instead?

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:44.540
And be the Uber?

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:45.830
That kind of idea but for AI infrastructure.
