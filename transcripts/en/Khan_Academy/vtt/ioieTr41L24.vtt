00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:03.230
Find the line of
best fit, or mark

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:05.010
that there is no
linear correlation.

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:07.190
So let's see, we have
a bunch of data points,

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:09.170
and we want to find a
line that at least shows

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:10.889
the trend in the data.

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:12.430
And this one seems
a little difficult

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:14.513
because if we ignore these
three points down here,

00:00:14.513 --> 00:00:17.400
maybe we could do a line that
looks something like this.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.070
It seems like it kind of
approximates this trend,

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:23.284
although this doesn't
seem like a great trend.

00:00:23.284 --> 00:00:25.200
And if we ignored these
two points right over,

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.190
we could do something like
maybe something like that.

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:30.940
But we can't just
ignore points like that.

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:32.440
So I would say that
there's actually

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:33.760
no good line of best fit here.

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.300
So let me check my answer.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.200
Let's try a couple
more of these.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.150
Find the line of best-- well,
this feels very similar.

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:44.004
It really feels like there's
no-- I mean, I could do that,

00:00:44.004 --> 00:00:45.420
but I'm ignoring
these two points.

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.915
I could do something
like that, then

00:00:47.915 --> 00:00:49.610
I'd be ignoring these points.

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.080
So I'd also say no good
best fit line exists.

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:54.800
So let's try one more.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.439
So here it looks like there's
very clearly this trend.

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:59.730
And I could try to fit it a
little bit better than it's

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.060
fit right now.

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:04.879
So it feels like something
like that fits this trend line

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:06.414
quite well.

00:01:06.414 --> 00:01:08.580
I could maybe drop this
down a little bit, something

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:09.079
like that.

00:01:09.079 --> 00:01:11.160
Let's check my answer.

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:12.950
A good best fit line exists.

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:14.380
Let me check my answer.

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.370
We got it right.
