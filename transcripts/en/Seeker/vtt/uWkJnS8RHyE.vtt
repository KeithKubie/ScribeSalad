00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:07.472
If you were born without half your brain doctors
wouldn't give you much chance for a normal

00:00:07.472 --> 00:00:13.910
life, but a woman in China is proving them
all wrong!

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:17.869
Hey friends it's Trace!

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:19.340
Thanks for watching DNews.

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:23.689
You know how I talk about how awesomely awesome
the brain is at re-routing connections and

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:24.689
adapting?

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.099
Here's the perfect example.

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:31.169
A 24-year-old woman in China complained of
dizziness and nausea to a doctor and eventually

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:35.480
they put her in a CAT scanner -- she was missing
her WHOLE CEREBELLUM.

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.160
Are you freaking out yet?

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.850
The cerebellum sits below the two brain hemispheres
and contains 50 percent of all the neurons

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:42.850
in your brain.

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:45.920
Imagine if HALF your brain cells were just…
not there!

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.250
Scientists believe the cerebellum is how we
control our motor skills, maintain balance,

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.250
and manage speech.

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.550
They also believe it assists the two hemispheres
in emotion, memory and attention.

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:00.210
And this woman was born without one and yet
doctors say she’s not functionally disabled.

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.490
The study in the journal Brain explained the
woman doesn't have difficulty speaking and

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:09.360
coordinating her movements, and she didn't
learn to speak until she was six or walk until

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.799
seven -- but again, without the part of the
brain to control those things… it's a surprise

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.460
she learned at all!

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.820
This case is a testament to brain plasticity.

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.490
We've talked about this before, brain plasticity
is the ability of the human brain to compensate

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:29.381
for changes in environment or body, like learning
to walk again after a stroke, or, in this

00:01:29.381 --> 00:01:32.790
case, learning to walk AT ALL without a motor
control center!

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.399
When you lose a finger, says iO9, the "neural
representations of neighboring fingers get

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:38.399
bigger."

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:41.880
But it’s commonly known that when you lose
one sense, the others heighten to compensate…

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:49.909
Still, how DID she learn to walk or speak
without the part of the brain for those tasks?

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:53.880
The doctors believe the functions normally
reserved for the cerebellum, were picked up

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.920
by the cerebral cortex -- the brain's outermost
layer.

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:03.479
Normally, the cortex assists in the regulation
of the motor controls, sensory information,

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.860
and association -- that is to say perception
of the world.

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.960
This case shows how plastic the brain really
is, in that this woman lives a relatively

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:18.010
normal life -- aside from her feelings of
dizziness and a mild mental impairment.

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.120
She was able to marry, have children, and
understands the world around her.

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:30.220
This is not the first case of a missing cerebellum;
there have been nine cases, starting in 1831.

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:35.381
Without CAT or MRI scans, most of the cases
were caught after death, like in 1940, when

00:02:35.381 --> 00:02:39.440
a 76 year old was found to have lived his
whole life without a cerebellum.

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.780
Whether the woman will live to that age is
unknown, doctors will surely be studying her

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.780
progress moving forward, though.

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.480
Thanks to brain plasticity it's not just the
cerebellum that can go missing without affect...

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:56.070
WIRED magazine reported earlier this year
that a man who was born without the connections

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:01.950
between the two hemispheres of his brain is
88 and lives a relatively normal life.

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.960
A scientific case study written about him
suggests aside from trouble drawing or using

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:08.730
both hands at once he's lived a normal life.

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:15.060
In 2007, New Scientist reported a man's head
was basically a hole instead of a brain!

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:22.170
50 to 75 percent of his skull was full of
cerebrospinal fluid, with only a thin layer

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.120
of brain tissue running around the edge and
connecting through the middle.

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:30.650
And yet, he worked for the government and
had a family with two children.

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.980
The human body has an amazing capacity for
adaptation and survival.

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.960
Scientists would have said all of these people
should not have survived, but here they are,

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:40.960
living lives.

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:42.500
Does stuff like this shock you anymore?

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.230
Do you know more about this case?

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:48.990

following her progress!
