00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.760
Hi I’m Adriene Hill, this is Crash Course Economics,
and today we’re going to talk about taxes.

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.050
We’re going to talk about why we have taxes,
what they do for us,

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:12.820
and why you should go ahead and take that raise
that’s going to bump you into the next tax bracket.

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:18.460
Also rebellions. And the British Empire’s
bad judgement when it came to taxing colonies.

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:27.340
[Theme Music]

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:32.560
While your struggles with taxes and the tax code
may seem particularly unpleasant to you today,

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:36.820
people have been paying, and complaining,
about taxes for a long time.

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:41.180
Way longer than any of us have been alive.
Or our parents. Or our grandparents.

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.940
Ancient Mesopotamians paid taxes in the form
of livestock and labor.

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:51.720
There are ancient Egyptians texts and tomb scenes showing evidence of taxes, tax collectors, and even tax shelters.

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.360
Taxation and tax collectors also show up in
Bible – over and over.

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:02.420
Taxes appear in scripture as a necessity, like: “Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar’s”

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.800
And tax collectors are in there as sinners,
right up with prostitutes.

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.700
More recently, in 1927, U.S. Supreme Court
Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote:

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.400
“Taxes are what we pay for civilized society.”

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.840
Maybe it’s time we forgive tax collectors
too…

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.560
So we’ve had taxes pretty much as long as
we’ve had records of organized society.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.030
But why? What are the goals of taxation?

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.490
At the most basic level, taxes raise money
for government services.

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:35.010
Taxes are used to promote the well-being of society – at least well-being as defined by the government in power.

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:38.570
They help us afford services markets might
not pay for on their own.

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.330
Things like public safety and national
defense and education.

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.300
Taxes can be used to protect the environment.

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:50.980
They can help a country implement fiscal and monetary policies, meant to push along economic growth.

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:54.460
Taxes can be used as a way to redistribute
wealth in a society –

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.560
from people who have more to people who have less.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.860
This can happen in a couple of ways – some
more direct than others.

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:07.280
An income tax system that taxes high income earners at a higher rate than low income earners is one example.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.820
And we’ll come back to that.

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.900
Government subsidies and vouchers – like
food stamps and housing programs also shift wealth.

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:19.560
So do luxury taxes – basically an additional tax bill
on expensive items like jet planes, expensive furs…

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:23.270
and that really annoying diamond ring space
on the Monopoly board.

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:26.780
Governments can also use taxes to TRY to change
people’s behavior.

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.610
Sin taxes on not-good-for-you products like
cigarettes and alcohol are meant to reduce

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.750
consumption of unhealthy products.

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.870
Gasoline taxes are meant to encourage people
to drive less.

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.810
France passed soda taxes, to try to get people
to drink fewer sugary drinks.

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:47.690
Denmark passed, and then got rid of, a “fat tax”
on foods that were relatively high in saturated fat.

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:54.040
A handful of governments, including those in British Columbia, Ireland, &amp; Chile have instituted “carbon taxes.”

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:59.520
These carbon taxes basically charge businesses
and sometimes households for the amount of

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.600
polluting greenhouse gases they use or create.

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.760
These carbon taxes take different forms around
the world.

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:13.100
Residents of British Columbia, for example, pay
an extra 6.67 cents per liter of gas as a carbon tax.

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:20.020
(For those of us in the US, Myanmar, and Liberia who don’t use the metric system, that’s about $0.25/gallon.)

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:27.320
In Chile, power plant operators pay $5 for every metric ton of carbon dioxide that they release into the air.

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:32.920
When economists talk about taxes, they sometimes
divide them into direct taxes and indirect taxes.

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:38.460
Direct taxes are paid directly by a person or organization to the government body that imposed the taxes.

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:42.960
These include property taxes and income taxes
– where there’s no intermediary – and

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:46.000
I can’t pass off the tax burden to someone
else.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:52.500
Value Added Taxes &amp; sales taxes aren’t exactly the same thing, but they're both good examples of indirect tax.

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:58.140
They’re collected by a store or seller or producer of goods, but are actually paid by consumers.

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.420
They’re taxes that ALL consumers have to
pay, regardless of how much money they make.

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:06.780
A pair of socks at the mall down the street
is going to cost me exactly the same as when

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.380
a billionaire buys that pair of socks at the
same store.

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:15.940
Some economists say indirect taxes distort
market prices, and lead to one of the things

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:21.240
most dreaded by economists, the Voldemort of economic outcomes: inefficiency.

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:25.920
Economists also characterize taxes as regressive,
progressive and proportional.

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:30.170
Let’s start with regressive taxes. Regressive
taxes are typically applied across the board –

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:34.760
and, on their face, they might seem equitable,
because everyone pays the same amount.

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:40.580
But regressive taxes take a higher toll on people
with lower-income than high-income earners.

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:44.680
Sales taxes, especially on essential items,
are considered regressive.

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:49.680
That’s why some places exempt food and prescription
drug purchases from sales taxes.

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:54.740
Some economists argue that fees for things
like hunting licenses, toll roads, and driver’s

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:56.920
licenses are also regressive. Why?

00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:00.420
Well, imagine two drivers go to the department
of motor vehicles to get a new license.

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:04.400
One makes $200,000 a year, the other makes
$20,000.

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.000
Both will pay exactly the same amount for
their driver’s license.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.380
The license fee is a much bigger hit for the
lower-income driver.

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:17.860
And that’s why regressive tax takes a disproportionate
toll on people with lower incomes.

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:21.480
On the other end of the taxing spectrum, there
are progressive taxes.

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:24.780
Progressive taxes are more or less the opposite
of regressive taxes –

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:30.620
in that they shift the burden of taxation to people who make more money, and away from those who make less.

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:35.520
In the United States, our income tax is a
progressive tax, meaning individual’s pay

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:37.970
more in taxes as they make more income.

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:41.910
But before you start worrying about whether
making an extra $100 this year is going to

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:43.960
bump you into a higher tax bracket –

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:48.410
it’s worth understanding how the progressive
income tax in the United States works.

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:53.930
When the IRS calculates how much you owe in
taxes, it uses marginal income tax brackets –

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:57.590
based on the amount of taxable income you
earned in a year.

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:03.080
These marginal tax rates represent the highest
possible income tax rate you could pay.

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:05.400
Right now, there are seven tax brackets.

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:11.440
But no matter which tax bracket you find yourself in –
you're not gonna pay that rate for your entire income.

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:17.540
Instead, your taxable income gets divided up
into chunks that correspond to each tax rate –

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:20.600
and you pay the associated rate on each of
those chunks.

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:25.740
For example, say you made $37,450 as a single
filer last year.

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:33.840
That would put you in the 15% tax bracket. But, you’d still pay the lower 10% rate on the first $9,225 you made.

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:41.840
So if you took the extra $100 and made $37,550
– you’d be bumped up to the 25% tax bracket.

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:48.100
But again, you’d only pay 25% on that extra $100.
Your effective tax rate would be lower.

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:52.020
The other thing you’ve gotta keep in mind
with U.S. income taxes is there are a huge

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:57.980
number of tax credits, tax exemptions and tax
deductions that reduce the amount people owe.

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:03.800
So your tax bill will never be as painful
as that 25% tax bracket might make you think.

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:07.500
Many other countries around the world have
their own progressive income tax systems.

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:11.720
But it turns out it’s difficult to measure
just how progressive any country’s total

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:15.210
tax system is, especially compared to another
country.

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:19.040
It’s not as easy as looking at countries
with the highest marginal tax rates and deciding

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:25.680
they have more progressive tax policy – because so many other taxes and tax breaks come into play.

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:32.300
In the U.S. some economists argue, the progressiveness
of our income tax code offsets the regressiveness

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:34.330
of many other taxes we pay.

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:37.030
If progressiveness and regressiveness are
even words.

00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:39.890
So we’ve covered regressive and progressive
taxes.

00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:42.770
The third type of taxes are proportional taxes.

00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:48.449
Proportional taxes require the same percentage of income for all taxpayers, regardless of how much they make.

00:07:48.449 --> 00:07:51.650
A flat tax is an example of a proportional
tax.

00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:54.180
You’ll hear politicians touting flat taxes –

00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:59.760
in part because they’re relatively simple compared to the U.S.’s current, incredibly-elaborate tax code.

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:04.340
And because they kind of FEEL fair.
Imagine a flat tax of 10%.

00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:08.400
The woman making $200,000 ends up sending
$20,000 to the government,

00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:14.570
while the guy making $20,000 sends only $2000.
They both feel a 10% pinch.

00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:19.290
Economists who oppose the flat tax say that
feelings have no place in the tax code.

00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:23.410
They argue a flat tax isn’t as simple OR
as fair as it seems.

00:08:23.410 --> 00:08:27.660
For one, they say that getting rid of all
the tax deductions and exemptions and credits

00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:31.800
we mentioned earlier could change a whole lot
of the economic decision making that happens –

00:08:31.810 --> 00:08:37.180
from saving for retirement in tax protected accounts to to home ownership and donating to charities.

00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:41.000
All those activities are encouraged by the
tax code we have now.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.480
Like we mentioned before, there are economists
who argue that the progressive income tax

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:47.800
in the U.S. offsets some of our other, more
regressive taxes.

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:52.480
They say a flat tax would shift the total
tax burden away from the wealthy to the lower

00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:57.390
and middle classes, actually making our broader
tax policy regressive.

00:08:57.390 --> 00:09:00.330
All of this is complicated.
Even if it sounds simple.

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:04.660
Before you buy into anyone’s plan to reform
the tax code, take the time to really read

00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:06.920
into what it might mean to the economy.

00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:09.829
And make sure you're comfortable with all
the implications.

00:09:09.829 --> 00:09:15.670
Speaking of implications of tax policy:
They can be incredibly serious. And fascinating.

00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:21.740
A poor tax choice by a government can and has resulted in rebellion. Let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:24.899
One tax rebellion you’ve probably heard
of is the American Revolution.

00:09:24.899 --> 00:09:29.910
After the Seven Years War ended in 1763, Great
Britain had a huge debt to pay off.

00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:34.420
It needed to raise revenue from somewhere,
and looked toward the colonists in America.

00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:38.800
In 1764, the British Parliament started taxing
molasses sales.

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:44.600
In 1765, they enacted the Stamp Act, which
added taxes to paper and legal documents.

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:51.200
Colonists grew more and more frustrated with British officials, both with tax policies and other interventions.

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:56.260
Anyway, you know how it goes. “No taxation without representation.” Boston Tea Party. A big war.

00:09:56.260 --> 00:10:01.980
The French get involved. And we end up with a free America. With taxes AND representation.

00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:03.420
Except in Washington, DC!

00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:08.480
More recently, in India, there was another super interesting tax rebellion – called the Salt March.

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:12.699
In 1930 India, the British were in charge,
and they had laws in place at the time that

00:10:12.699 --> 00:10:16.139
outlawed Indians from collecting or selling
salt.

00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:21.610
Instead they had to buy it from a British
monopoly, which collected an 8.2% salt tax.

00:10:21.610 --> 00:10:27.180
Mohandas Gandhi decided to defy the Salt Act
– by walking 240 miles to the coast of the

00:10:27.189 --> 00:10:30.169
Arabian sea – to gather tax-free salt.

00:10:30.169 --> 00:10:35.080
Along his route, more and more Indians joined
him in the peaceful civil disobedience.

00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:38.800
He got to the beach, picked up a piece of
salt, and broke the law.

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:45.020
Thousands of others followed his lead – making and selling non-British salt – in a non-violent resistance.

00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:49.560
The Salt March was extensively covered in
newsreels and newspapers, and it brought international

00:10:49.569 --> 00:10:53.689
attention to the largely non-violent Indian
struggle for Independence.

00:10:53.689 --> 00:10:56.480
All that because of taxes.
Thanks Thought Bubble.

00:10:56.490 --> 00:11:00.129
Of course, there are other ways to get around
paying taxes you don’t want to pay – other

00:11:00.129 --> 00:11:03.389
than fighting or starting a mass-civil disobedience
movement.

00:11:03.389 --> 00:11:08.189
Based on historical documents, we know people have been running away from paying taxes for years.

00:11:08.189 --> 00:11:11.389
Some literally picking up and leaving their
homes.

00:11:11.389 --> 00:11:15.229
Other people have discovered career paths
that get them out of tax bills.

00:11:15.229 --> 00:11:20.689
Historians think that some European men became monks during the Middle Ages to avoid being taxed.

00:11:20.689 --> 00:11:25.480
There’s proof that some Chinese men joined Buddhist monasteries to get out of paying taxes.

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:28.820
There is plenty of room for disagreement
over how big government should be –

00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:30.680
and what it should and shouldn’t be doing.

00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:37.200
All those discussions matter to you as a taxpayer, and as someone who benefits from taxation and government services.

00:11:37.209 --> 00:11:42.480
But, as we’ve said time and time again – there are some services the market just won’t provide.

00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:49.000
Some protections it won’t guarantee. No one likes paying taxes. But we do like what they do for us.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.840
