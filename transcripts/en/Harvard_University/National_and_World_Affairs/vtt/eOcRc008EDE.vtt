I first became aware of John Kennedy as a
kid in India i was growing up in the nineteen

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:07.319
sixties in India

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:14.319
and Kennedy burst onto the Indian imagination
as this powerful energetic charismatic figure

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:19.710
uh... really the first American president
to a done so of for modern india

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.119
uh... i remember we had an LP of his inaugural
address i think it had a couple of other speeches

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:25.949
as well

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.769
uh... and we would play at home and we would
listen to it i don't think i understood a word

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:33.250
i mean in a deeper sense of what it meant

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:34.390
uh... but

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:41.390
it's under grand and uplifting uh... and over
the years i think Kennedy remained for many

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:43.210
many

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:43.970
decades

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:46.430
the only American president

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:48.710
who captured the imagination

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.909
off people outside of America certainly
this was true in India

00:00:51.909 --> 00:00:54.229
he captured the imagination of India

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:57.590
he captured the imagination indians he appealed
to Indians

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:01.110
uh... at that level of the heart not just
the level of the head
