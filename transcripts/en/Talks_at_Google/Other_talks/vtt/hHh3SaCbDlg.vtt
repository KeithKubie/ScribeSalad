00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.888
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:07.360
JAIME GREEN: Please welcome to
the stage Senator Al Franken.

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:11.053
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:11.053 --> 00:00:12.031
AL FRANKEN: Thank you.

00:00:12.031 --> 00:00:13.196
Thank you.

00:00:13.196 --> 00:00:13.987
JAIME GREEN: Hello.

00:00:13.987 --> 00:00:15.195
AL FRANKEN: Thank you, Jaime.

00:00:15.195 --> 00:00:16.432
JAIME GREEN: Welcome.

00:00:16.432 --> 00:00:17.910
AL FRANKEN: Thank you.

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.580
JAIME GREEN: I'd love to start
by talking about what inspired

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.720
you to write this book.

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.660
A lot of the book is sort of
timeless political memoir.

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:28.620
We get your childhood
and your career

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:30.270
before the Senate and all that.

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:32.520
But as it gets closer
to the current day,

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:38.980
it starts to feel kind of urgent
and specific to our moment.

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.995
And so I was curious when you
decided to write this book.

00:00:42.995 --> 00:00:45.120
AL FRANKEN: When I decided
to write this book was--

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.330
this book is sort
of about answering

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:55.446
the question I get asked
the most, which is,

00:00:55.446 --> 00:00:58.950
is being a United States
senator as much fun

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:01.620
as working on
"Saturday Night Live"?

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.250
And the answer to that is no.

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.710
Why would it be?

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.540
But it's the best
job I've ever had,

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.450
because you get to
improve people's lives.

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:18.510
And so-- and a lot
of this is also

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:24.420
about the tension of having
been a comedian and a satirist

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.960
pretty much all my life, and
then making this transition.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.800
That's the question I
get asked second most,

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.140
how did I make that transition?

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.340
And I felt free to
start writing this

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.840
after I was re-elected,
because my first election was

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.270
a 312 vote margin.

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.530
And we had a recount.

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.500
We had a legal proceeding.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:57.960
So my wife and I were
going to have a vacation,

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.560
six days up in a lodge
in Northern Minnesota.

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.440
She was in Washington
with her grandchildren,

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.995
and she got sick.

00:02:07.995 --> 00:02:09.870
And we were going to go
to Africa immediately

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:13.320
after that vacation on a codel,
a congressional delegation

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:17.190
trip, so she wanted to
just rest up for that.

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.490
So I ended up in a
cabin for six days.

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:24.971
And I had threatened to
myself to write about this,

00:02:24.971 --> 00:02:26.220
so I started writing about it.

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.700
And I was worried
that, you know,

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.700
it would just become "The
Shining" or something.

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.350
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.810
But it didn't.

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.890
It was a lot of
fun, and it actually

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.710
helped me think about
being a senator.

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:40.230
And so I try to tell
people how I make

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.750
this transition, how I made it.

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.100
It had its hairy moments.

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.220
That first campaign
was very ugly.

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:56.970
They took every thing that I had
ever said or written in comedy

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.280
and put it through this--

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.220
you'd be interested
in this machine.

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.780
It's called the dehumanizer.

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.810
And it had a lot of technology
from Silicon Valley.

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.880
And what it does is it
decontextualizes anything

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.300
you ever wrote as a joke, and
just takes out all the irony,

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.540
hyperbole-- anything
you've done--

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:23.040
and leaves it as something
that you can attack.

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.380
And they did that.

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:33.440
For example, I wrote
a piece, I don't

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:38.280
know, around 1999 or
2000, about the internet

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.270
and how parents should kind
of monitor what their kids are

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:43.230
doing on the internet.

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:48.360
And I wrote what I think is
a very conservative joke.

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:54.570
I said that, you know,
the internet is great.

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:59.670
My son uses the internet
to do a sixth grade

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.010
report on beastiality.

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:09.420
And he downloaded a
lot of great images.

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.990
And the kids in the class just
loved them, because you know,

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:15.840
at that age they're
just sponges.

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.610
And so that was turned
into an ad which is,

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:23.750
Al Franken jokes
about beastiality.

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:29.240
It kind of comes from infinity
and then goes through your--

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:29.895
the drone.

00:04:29.895 --> 00:04:32.340
[DEEP VOICE] Al Franken.

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:33.270
You know?

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:35.940
And so there was a lot of that.

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.130
So I won by 312 votes.

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:41.250
And I felt that the
people of Minnesota

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:43.620
deserved to know I was
there for a serious purpose.

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:49.600
So I built my own
dehumanizer, my staff, and--

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.285
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:57.967
I kind of showed people,
Minnesotans especially,

00:04:57.967 --> 00:05:00.300
that I was going to be a
workhorse and not a show horse.

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.180
And I did that.

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:06.870
I won re-election by a
very comfortable amount.

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:12.600
And it's freed me up to be
a workhorse with a sense

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.370
of humor, to be funny again.

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:15.890
JAIME GREEN: Yeah.

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:20.300
Before we go into talking
about your work in the Senate,

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:23.690
I do want to ask one
question about your comedy.

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:28.347
Because you move pretty quickly
through your "SNL" and comedy

00:05:28.347 --> 00:05:29.430
writing years in the book.

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:34.430
But one thing that really struck
me was you write about one

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:37.560
of your most famous
characters, Stuart Smalley,

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:42.180
who actually is this ridiculous
mockery of a character

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:44.180
in a lot of ways but
actually came from a really

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:45.292
sincere inspiration.

00:05:45.292 --> 00:05:46.000
AL FRANKEN: Yeah.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.350
I don't think of him as
a mockery of a character.

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:54.950
Basically, what happens-- and
I talk about in the campaign,

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:56.800
my wife Franni--

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:02.060
I was being attacked all the
time through those kind of ads.

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:06.650
And she is an alcoholic.

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:08.960
She's a recovering alcoholic.

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:14.180
There was a period where
it was tough, obviously,

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:18.080
on her and on our marriage.

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:21.140
But she talked about how
I stuck it out with her.

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:23.750
And she wanted to talk
about my character.

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:24.980
And she did an ad.

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:27.950
She sat down with
Mandy Grunwald,

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:32.300
who was our media consultant,
and did a beautiful ad.

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:36.140
It's in a chapter called
"Franni Saves the Campaign."

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:43.460
And she just wanted to talk
about how not only did I

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:48.680
stand with her and
support her, but also I

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:54.590
wrote a couple of
movies about this,

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:57.890
one called "A Man Loves a Woman"
with Meg Ryan and Andy Garcia.

00:06:57.890 --> 00:06:59.780
She wanted to know
that people did this.

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:05.630
She said something in the ad
that just made me cry and made

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:09.740
Chuck Schumer cry,
which is actually easier

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:10.970
to do than you might think.

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:12.890
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:18.200
And in this ad, they
showed pictures of us

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:19.370
and our kids and stuff.

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:25.790
She said, how can a mother of
two such beautiful children

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:27.830
be an alcoholic?

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:35.090
And it spoke to the
shame that a lot of women

00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:38.240
feel and alcoholics feel.

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:44.000
And it just touched a nerve.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.360
An anchor at the CBS
affiliate in Minneapolis

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:51.230
said, this is the best
political ad of the year

00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:54.800
because it's actually an
ad that could help people.

00:07:54.800 --> 00:08:02.060
And two days after the ad ran,
we had a debate in a gymnasium.

00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:04.845
The place was jammed full,
and people on the floor

00:08:04.845 --> 00:08:05.720
and in the bleachers.

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:09.140
When she entered the room,
she got a standing ovation.

00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:12.190
And I wouldn't have
won without that ad.

00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:17.210
I would have lost
by a lot, I imagine.

00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:21.830
So during that time, during
that period of our lives,

00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:23.420
I was at "SNL" and
I started going

00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:25.490
to Al-Anon, which is
for family members

00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:26.960
and friends of alcoholics.

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:29.697
And I learned a
lot about myself.

00:08:29.697 --> 00:08:31.280
And one of the things
I learned, which

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:34.580
I'm kind of
embarrassed to say, is

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:37.309
that I learned in
Al-Anon meetings

00:08:37.309 --> 00:08:41.270
that you can learn stuff from
people who at first blush

00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:44.059
don't seem smart.

00:08:44.059 --> 00:08:48.200
And my parents have always
emphasized education,

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:50.210
and you learn from
people who are

00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:53.060
educated and smarter than you.

00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:54.920
My dad didn't
graduate high school,

00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:57.510
so it was very important.

00:08:57.510 --> 00:09:02.060
And there was a guy who Stuart
was a little model laughter who

00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:04.970
said that the higher
power had put an apartment

00:09:04.970 --> 00:09:06.340
in his life one week.

00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:08.050
And I just went, ugh.

00:09:08.050 --> 00:09:10.700
It was here in New York.

00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:12.440
And the next week,
he said something

00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:16.890
that just hit me so hard that
was about his experience.

00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:20.780
And so I made a character
who was very vulnerable

00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:24.200
and kind of at first
blush an idiot,

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:28.920
but to try to explain
what recovery was.

00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:32.960
And so that's where
Stuart Smalley was from.

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:33.710
JAIME GREEN: Yeah.

00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:42.640
So much of your comedy career
can be defined as satire,

00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:45.050
as a satirist.

00:09:45.050 --> 00:09:47.940
What's sort of the
impulse behind that?

00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:50.630
Because with Stuart, you were
trying to really communicate

00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:51.980
something sincere.

00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:54.290
AL FRANKEN: Yeah.

00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:56.400
I've done really stupid comedy--

00:09:56.400 --> 00:10:04.820
you know, Belushi as Liz Taylor
choking on a chicken bone.

00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:06.620
Julia Child bleeding to death.

00:10:09.730 --> 00:10:11.070
So I've done all kinds.

00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:14.000
But I'd always done
political satire.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:23.610
And it really comes from very,
very early when I was young,

00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:25.660
the civil rights
movement was happening.

00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:31.450
And my dad, we watched the
news while we ate dinner

00:10:31.450 --> 00:10:32.866
on tray tables.

00:10:32.866 --> 00:10:33.990
My mom made a great dinner.

00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:36.400
It wasn't a TV dinner.

00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:37.750
It was a really nice dinner.

00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:40.330
But we would watch the news.

00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:43.530
This was during the
civil rights struggle.

00:10:43.530 --> 00:10:48.990
And when sheriffs would put fire
hoses and billy clubs and dogs

00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:53.220
on demonstrators, my dad
would point to the TV and say,

00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:55.770
no Jew can be for this.

00:10:55.770 --> 00:10:57.930
No Jew can be for this.

00:10:57.930 --> 00:11:03.570
And that was a very big lesson
for us, for me and my brother,

00:11:03.570 --> 00:11:08.460
about justice, and
why that matters.

00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:10.800
And it's one of the reasons--

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:13.210
actually, my dad
was a Republican.

00:11:13.210 --> 00:11:16.860
But when Barry Goldwater voted
against the civil rights bill

00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:23.550
and was the nominee, he became
a Democrat and stuck with that.

00:11:23.550 --> 00:11:27.050
So we lost the South because
of the civil rights bill,

00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:28.140
but we gained my dad--

00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:30.864
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:30.864 --> 00:11:31.920
--and me.

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:36.880
And so I always
cared about politics

00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:39.900
and I always wrote
political satire.

00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:42.930
And I'm very proud
of the work that I

00:11:42.930 --> 00:11:45.530
did in satire on the show.

00:11:45.530 --> 00:11:46.500
I write about this.

00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:49.320
Jim Downey is a guy
I wrote a lot with.

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:52.450
He was a very
thoughtful conservative.

00:11:52.450 --> 00:11:54.450
I like to think I'm a
thoughtful progressive.

00:11:54.450 --> 00:11:56.500
We did not feel that
the job of the show

00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:58.840
was to have a political bias.

00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:00.510
We felt the job of
the show was to do

00:12:00.510 --> 00:12:04.580
well-observed political satire.

00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:06.020
And Jim and the thing.

00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:09.870
It was, we want to reward
people for knowing stuff

00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:12.580
but not punish them
for not knowing stuff.

00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:19.170
So I think we wrote very well
observed, intelligent satire

00:12:19.170 --> 00:12:20.602
that everyone enjoyed.

00:12:20.602 --> 00:12:21.930
JAIME GREEN: Yeah.

00:12:21.930 --> 00:12:26.370
You mentioned earlier the
dehumanizer of the campaign,

00:12:26.370 --> 00:12:29.490
and then bringing that into
your own work in the Senate

00:12:29.490 --> 00:12:31.410
and focusing on--

00:12:31.410 --> 00:12:33.910
AL FRANKEN: I'll give you an
example of the dehumanizer when

00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:37.020
I'm in the Senate.

00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:43.464
When the Supreme Court voted
5-4 on marriage equality,

00:12:43.464 --> 00:12:44.880
I thought that was
a big day and I

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:47.790
wanted to put out a
press release saying,

00:12:47.790 --> 00:12:51.495
I congratulate the Court
for making this decision.

00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:57.740
Actually, it was going
to be, Senator Franken

00:12:57.740 --> 00:13:01.840
is very happy with
this court's decision

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:06.070
allowing everybody to
marry the person they love,

00:13:06.070 --> 00:13:11.880
but Senator Franken felt
that Justice Scalia's dissent

00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:13.471
was very gay.

00:13:13.471 --> 00:13:16.838
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:20.350 --> 00:13:21.790
My team said no.

00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:22.972
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:22.972 --> 00:13:23.824
JAIME GREEN: Really?

00:13:23.824 --> 00:13:24.535
AL FRANKEN: Yeah.

00:13:24.535 --> 00:13:25.660
No, you can't put that out.

00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:27.750
Now, this was after I
had won re-election.

00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:30.870
So I thought, oh, come on.

00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:34.510
And so we didn't put that out.

00:13:34.510 --> 00:13:36.040
But I got it in the book.

00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:37.550
It's in the book.

00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:40.690
So there's a lot of stuff
in the book that didn't

00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:43.120
survive our own dehumanizer.

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:44.640
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:46.210
JAIME GREEN: But
even as all of that

00:13:46.210 --> 00:13:49.210
gets stripped away and
saved for future books,

00:13:49.210 --> 00:13:53.209
you have found kind of a
performance venue in your work

00:13:53.209 --> 00:13:55.000
in the Senate, which
is committee hearings.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.590
And it might not
have been that way

00:13:56.590 --> 00:13:58.750
if this weren't the
age of internet video.

00:13:58.750 --> 00:14:02.980
But I sat and watched
your questioning

00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:08.100
of Betsy DeVos and other cabinet
nominees and things like that.

00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:16.020
So it seems like that committee
work is really high-profile.

00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:18.340
How do you end up
on the committees

00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:20.560
that you're on in the Senate?

00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:23.380
AL FRANKEN: The leader of your
party assigns you to them.

00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:26.805
And I had an eight
month process, a recount

00:14:26.805 --> 00:14:29.125
and a legal process,
so I got there last.

00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:33.910
So I got what
Harry had leftover.

00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:35.351
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:35.850 --> 00:14:42.220
And so I got judiciary.

00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:44.170
I asked for certain
committees and he said no,

00:14:44.170 --> 00:14:45.790
and then he told me what I had.

00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:48.460
And he said, you'd be
great in judiciary.

00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:51.460
And I said, I don't know if
you've noticed this, Harry,

00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:53.460
but there are a lot of
lawyers in the Senate.

00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:55.290
And I ain't one of them.

00:14:55.290 --> 00:15:01.500
And he said, that's
why you'd be great.

00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:04.920
And he was bullshitting.

00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:06.280
That's what he had.

00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:07.960
So I'm on Judiciary.

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:09.960
And I'm really happy I am.

00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:11.460
I'm really happy I am.

00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:13.380
I've done a lot of judiciary.

00:15:16.590 --> 00:15:22.000
And later, I got
what I did ask for,

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.450
which is the health committee--
health, education, labor,

00:15:24.450 --> 00:15:27.720
and pensions, which is not
that important unless you care

00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:32.340
about your health or your
kid's health or your parents'

00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:35.895
health or their education
or your education.

00:15:35.895 --> 00:15:37.320
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:40.680
Or if you plan to work
sometime during your life

00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:42.480
or maybe retire.

00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:48.210
Other than that, it doesn't
have much, uh, jurisdiction.

00:15:48.210 --> 00:15:51.010
And then I'm on the
Energy Committee now.

00:15:51.010 --> 00:15:54.990
But at that time, I was
put on the Aging Committee.

00:15:54.990 --> 00:15:58.020
And Aging Committee is a
nonlegislative committee.

00:15:58.020 --> 00:16:05.190
And I actually said
to Harry, aging?

00:16:05.190 --> 00:16:07.500
I mean, are people aging?

00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:10.485
And he didn't know
that I was kidding.

00:16:10.485 --> 00:16:12.540
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:14.190
Harry's got a very
good sense of humor,

00:16:14.190 --> 00:16:15.870
but he didn't know me then.

00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:22.170
And so anyway, that's how you
get your committee assignments.

00:16:22.170 --> 00:16:24.090
That's the answer
to that question.

00:16:24.090 --> 00:16:25.800
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:31.080
JAIME GREEN: And so with these
sort of hearings and sessions

00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:34.000
of questioning being put on
the internet and for everyone

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:34.800
to see them now--

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:37.140
you don't have to sit at home
and watch C-SPAN in order

00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:39.094
to catch it--

00:16:39.094 --> 00:16:40.260
it can be very entertaining.

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:41.910
AL FRANKEN: And that's a
relief for everybody here

00:16:41.910 --> 00:16:43.050
who used to do that.

00:16:43.050 --> 00:16:43.883
JAIME GREEN: I know.

00:16:43.883 --> 00:16:46.300
It was really interfering
with their work, [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:49.320
But they can be
very entertaining,

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:51.150
and certainly galvanizing.

00:16:51.150 --> 00:16:53.790
But I'm curious,
within the Senate,

00:16:53.790 --> 00:16:55.350
how those hearings function.

00:16:55.350 --> 00:16:56.850
Do they actually affect votes?

00:16:56.850 --> 00:17:00.944
What do you see the role of
those performances to be?

00:17:00.944 --> 00:17:03.110
AL FRANKEN: Well, I don't
consider it a performance.

00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:04.190
I consider it a hearing.

00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:06.390
And I consider a hearing
as a serious thing,

00:17:06.390 --> 00:17:09.540
where you're representing--

00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:12.150
I'm representing the people of
Minnesota in those hearings,

00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:16.319
and I want to ask questions
I want the answers to.

00:17:16.319 --> 00:17:19.400
Sometimes the effect
of the hearing--

00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:24.599
we did not stop
people from-- like,

00:17:24.599 --> 00:17:28.440
we did not stop Betsy DeVos
from getting confirmed.

00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:30.750
The vice president, for
the first time in history,

00:17:30.750 --> 00:17:33.690
had to come down and cast
the tie-breaking vote

00:17:33.690 --> 00:17:35.850
to get her confirmed.

00:17:35.850 --> 00:17:42.750
But I felt that she did not
know education policy, which

00:17:42.750 --> 00:17:46.110
for the Secretary of Education
is an issue, I think.

00:17:46.110 --> 00:17:51.250
And so I demonstrated
that in my questioning.

00:17:51.250 --> 00:17:53.620
Sometimes the
questioning is something

00:17:53.620 --> 00:17:56.470
that exists for the record.

00:17:56.470 --> 00:18:03.090
In the judiciary hearings, I
asked Jeff Sessions a question

00:18:03.090 --> 00:18:08.160
that he responded to by
saying that he had not

00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:10.800
met with any Russians
during the campaign.

00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:14.280
That turned out not to be true.

00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:19.980
And he's under oath, and
that's a serious thing.

00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:22.740
But we didn't find that out till
well after he'd been confirmed.

00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:26.820
And there's some
news breaking today,

00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:30.690
possibly, about that,
about Senator Leahy and I,

00:18:30.690 --> 00:18:34.950
after we were not satisfied
with his answers about why

00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:40.590
he had not disclosed his
meetings with the Russians--

00:18:40.590 --> 00:18:44.910
which seems to be
something that there's

00:18:44.910 --> 00:18:50.790
a pattern of this, shall we say,
in the Trump administration.

00:18:50.790 --> 00:18:55.380
They aren't acting like people
who have nothing to hide.

00:18:55.380 --> 00:19:01.650
And because of his not
answering my question,

00:19:01.650 --> 00:19:04.620
or answering my question
in the way he did--

00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:07.785
not truthfully-- he ended
up recusing himself.

00:19:07.785 --> 00:19:11.170
And because he recused
himself, Rod Rosenstein,

00:19:11.170 --> 00:19:13.560
the Deputy Attorney
General, assigned

00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:15.342
the special
prosecutor, ultimately.

00:19:15.342 --> 00:19:17.300
And so that's why we have
a special prosecutor.

00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:22.010
So sometimes you do things
to get things on the record.

00:19:22.010 --> 00:19:23.260
JAIME GREEN: That makes sense.

00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:24.550
Yeah.

00:19:24.550 --> 00:19:30.650
So in the book, you
also write about being

00:19:30.650 --> 00:19:32.930
friends with many of your
Republican colleagues

00:19:32.930 --> 00:19:34.010
in the Senate.

00:19:34.010 --> 00:19:36.920
And you write about how
you're friends with them

00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:39.992
even though you vigorously
disagree with them.

00:19:39.992 --> 00:19:40.700
AL FRANKEN: Sure.

00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:42.241
JAIME GREEN: And I
would love to hear

00:19:42.241 --> 00:19:45.140
you talk about that a little,
because it seems like--

00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:48.420
it's not just, oh, I think
we should tax at 18%.

00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:50.150
I think we should tax at 14%.

00:19:50.150 --> 00:19:53.300
These are huge, almost
moral disagreements.

00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:58.026
And I think that it can be
very relevant to those of us

00:19:58.026 --> 00:19:59.900
not working in the Senate
too because they're

00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:03.140
your colleagues, but some
of us have friends or family

00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:05.604
or colleagues with whom we
have these similar, very, very

00:20:05.604 --> 00:20:06.395
deep disagreements.

00:20:06.395 --> 00:20:08.690
So how do you maintain
those relationships?

00:20:08.690 --> 00:20:11.960
AL FRANKEN: Well,
we're a workplace.

00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:14.015
And you want to be
a good coworker.

00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:23.390
The way to get things done
in the Senate is to have--

00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:28.400
you're living in a town
that has 100 people in it,

00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:31.700
and your word has to be good.

00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:33.260
And that's more than anything.

00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:35.960
And I bonded with a
number of Republicans

00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:39.230
right away just with humor.

00:20:41.930 --> 00:20:45.830
Jim DeMint, a very
right-wing senator

00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:47.840
at the time from
South Carolina-- now

00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:49.714
he's head of the
Heritage Foundation--

00:20:49.714 --> 00:20:51.380
came up to me on the
floor the first day

00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:55.584
I was there and said, how
are things on the far left?

00:20:55.584 --> 00:20:56.500
I said, they're great.

00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:58.310
How are things on
the nutcase right?

00:20:58.310 --> 00:20:59.270
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:59.270 --> 00:21:02.900
And he laughed, and we
continued having a relationship

00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:04.400
while he was in
the Senate, based

00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:06.920
on just giving each other crap.

00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:10.550
But it was a good relationship.

00:21:10.550 --> 00:21:14.540
Lindsey Graham is really funny.

00:21:14.540 --> 00:21:19.370
When he was like 16th out of
17 in the presidential race,

00:21:19.370 --> 00:21:22.070
I went up to him
and said, you know,

00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:26.300
Lindsey, if I were voting
in the Republican primaries,

00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:27.124
I'd vote for you.

00:21:27.124 --> 00:21:28.415
And he said, that's my problem.

00:21:28.415 --> 00:21:30.870
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:38.580
Now, I have one
colleague, Tom Coburn,

00:21:38.580 --> 00:21:43.360
who didn't seem to have
any sense of humor.

00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:46.950
So my first four or
five exchanges with him

00:21:46.950 --> 00:21:47.650
were not good.

00:21:47.650 --> 00:21:50.419
And I went up to him.

00:21:50.419 --> 00:21:51.960
I said, Tom, can I
take you to lunch?

00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:53.790
He said, tell you what.

00:21:53.790 --> 00:21:55.650
Take me to breakfast.

00:21:55.650 --> 00:22:00.210
And Tom was kind
of called Dr. No,

00:22:00.210 --> 00:22:04.380
because he was a medical doctor
before he went into the Senate,

00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:12.540
and he also was very,
very big on spending.

00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:14.400
He wanted to balance the budget.

00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:16.590
And he said no to
a lot of things,

00:22:16.590 --> 00:22:23.010
and used his privileges
to stop a lot of stuff.

00:22:23.010 --> 00:22:25.905
So we go to breakfast
the next day.

00:22:28.377 --> 00:22:30.210
At the beginning of
breakfast I said, look--

00:22:30.210 --> 00:22:31.584
we're in the Senate
dining room--

00:22:31.584 --> 00:22:34.490
I said, over the
next 45 minutes,

00:22:34.490 --> 00:22:35.704
we can talk about anything.

00:22:35.704 --> 00:22:37.870
We can talk about politics,
talk about our families,

00:22:37.870 --> 00:22:41.070
talk about our
careers before here.

00:22:41.070 --> 00:22:42.480
But let's have fun, OK?

00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:44.160
He goes, OK, let's have fun.

00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:45.730
We'll have fun.

00:22:45.730 --> 00:22:50.770
So I said, OK, now,
let's talk about careers.

00:22:50.770 --> 00:22:53.970
You were a doctor
before you came here.

00:22:53.970 --> 00:22:55.110
Let me ask you something.

00:22:55.110 --> 00:22:59.820
To be a doctor in
Oklahoma, do you have

00:22:59.820 --> 00:23:02.340
to have any formal education?

00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:05.532
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:06.922 --> 00:23:08.380
And he said,
[SHOUTING] yes, you've

00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:09.970
got to go to medical school.

00:23:09.970 --> 00:23:11.170
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:11.170 --> 00:23:16.090
And I said, OK, that was a joke.

00:23:16.090 --> 00:23:21.370
You see, that's what
I did for my career.

00:23:21.370 --> 00:23:24.670
And then we had a delightful
breakfast in which

00:23:24.670 --> 00:23:26.230
I taught him what jokes were--

00:23:26.230 --> 00:23:27.400
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:29.581
--and what proper response was.

00:23:29.581 --> 00:23:31.330
And he wrote me a note
afterwards and said

00:23:31.330 --> 00:23:33.670
he had a delightful breakfast.

00:23:33.670 --> 00:23:35.060
And we got along really well.

00:23:35.060 --> 00:23:37.310
And so I write
about Ted Cruz, who

00:23:37.310 --> 00:23:41.590
seems to be the
exception to the rule.

00:23:41.590 --> 00:23:42.475
JAIME GREEN: Yeah.

00:23:42.475 --> 00:23:44.600
We're going to open it up
to questions in a minute,

00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:46.960
so if you have a
question, you can line up

00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:49.030
at one of the microphones.

00:23:49.030 --> 00:23:51.430
But I want to ask
one more question.

00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:56.290
So you point out in the book
that once President Obama was

00:23:56.290 --> 00:23:58.330
elected, the Republican
plan in Congress

00:23:58.330 --> 00:24:00.370
just became obstruction.

00:24:00.370 --> 00:24:02.860
Stop him from getting
anything done.

00:24:02.860 --> 00:24:07.210
And that hasn't changed.

00:24:07.210 --> 00:24:08.885
They still are trying
to stop anything--

00:24:08.885 --> 00:24:10.510
AL FRANKEN: No, I
mean, it has changed.

00:24:10.510 --> 00:24:12.010
We have a different
from President.

00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:18.950
Mitch McConnell said something
that kind of shocked me.

00:24:18.950 --> 00:24:23.710
He said, our number one goal is
to see to it that Barack Obama

00:24:23.710 --> 00:24:25.460
is a one-term president.

00:24:25.460 --> 00:24:27.160
And I wasn't shocked
that he thought

00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:29.650
that but I was shocked that
he said it out loud, because I

00:24:29.650 --> 00:24:34.660
think our number one goal should
be to improve people's lives,

00:24:34.660 --> 00:24:38.140
to provide a world-class
education to our kids,

00:24:38.140 --> 00:24:41.650
to make sure that our
economy is working,

00:24:41.650 --> 00:24:46.580
to make sure that veterans
get the care they need.

00:24:46.580 --> 00:24:49.810
There's a lot of
things that must

00:24:49.810 --> 00:24:52.900
come before partisan politics.

00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:54.880
So I was shocked about that.

00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:57.790
But he used the
rules of the Senate

00:24:57.790 --> 00:25:02.830
to try to stop Barack Obama
from having any achievements.

00:25:02.830 --> 00:25:07.120
And I have a chapter called
"The Great Curdling."

00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:11.710
And things curdled during
that period and got very bad.

00:25:11.710 --> 00:25:14.710
When I first got
there, it was bad.

00:25:14.710 --> 00:25:19.070
And I asked a colleague who had
been there for about 30 years,

00:25:19.070 --> 00:25:20.410
I said, was it always this bad?

00:25:20.410 --> 00:25:22.180
No, no, no, no.

00:25:22.180 --> 00:25:24.820
I said, has it ever
been worse than this?

00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:26.780
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:25:26.780 --> 00:25:30.040
Remember when that
guy got caned?

00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:34.570
And I said, Charles Sumner
who got caned like right

00:25:34.570 --> 00:25:35.445
before the Civil War?

00:25:35.445 --> 00:25:36.970
And he goes, yeah,
that was worse.

00:25:36.970 --> 00:25:37.759
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:37.759 --> 00:25:38.425
JAIME GREEN: OK.

00:25:38.425 --> 00:25:41.335
That's reassuring.

00:25:41.335 --> 00:25:42.305
AL FRANKEN: Yeah.

00:25:42.305 --> 00:25:45.940
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:50.470
So you write in the book,
by the time you read this,

00:25:50.470 --> 00:25:51.940
Republicans may
well have succeeded

00:25:51.940 --> 00:25:54.530
in repealing some or all
of the Affordable Care Act.

00:25:54.530 --> 00:25:56.530
But I'm willing to bet
they won't have succeeded

00:25:56.530 --> 00:25:58.974
in replacing it, because
the truth is they've never

00:25:58.974 --> 00:26:01.390
been interested in addressing
the central challenge, which

00:26:01.390 --> 00:26:04.160
I think applies sort of
broadly to that curdling.

00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:08.020
So if they're not trying to
pass legislation that will

00:26:08.020 --> 00:26:10.900
improve or replace Obamacare--

00:26:10.900 --> 00:26:14.200
AL FRANKEN: This is the
thing about the book.

00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:17.590
We did education together
in the health committee.

00:26:17.590 --> 00:26:20.530
And Lamar Alexander was
very good in that process.

00:26:20.530 --> 00:26:24.640
And it took us a while, but
we ultimately passed a bill

00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:26.590
that we all were happy with.

00:26:26.590 --> 00:26:28.130
And we can do it.

00:26:28.130 --> 00:26:29.530
So it depends on the issue.

00:26:29.530 --> 00:26:33.430
But on health
care, I don't think

00:26:33.430 --> 00:26:37.340
the Republicans thought Donald
Trump would become president.

00:26:37.340 --> 00:26:40.360
They assumed Hillary would
be and they could still

00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:46.045
continue to use Obamacare
just as a political bludgeon.

00:26:50.250 --> 00:26:53.650
And I don't think
that they have given--

00:26:53.650 --> 00:26:58.090
Donald Trump said
that nobody knew

00:26:58.090 --> 00:27:01.150
that health care was
complicated until he figured out

00:27:01.150 --> 00:27:03.470
that it was complicated.

00:27:03.470 --> 00:27:06.910
It's very complex, our
health care system.

00:27:06.910 --> 00:27:12.220
And I don't think that many
of my Republican colleagues--

00:27:12.220 --> 00:27:15.640
and I know this for sure,
because I've talked to many

00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:16.510
of them--

00:27:16.510 --> 00:27:22.900
have really thought through what
to replace the Affordable Care

00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:23.907
Act with.

00:27:23.907 --> 00:27:25.240
That's what I was writing about.

00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:28.405
And of course, we're
seeing a process

00:27:28.405 --> 00:27:31.540
that I think is the wrong
process in the Senate right

00:27:31.540 --> 00:27:36.720
now, where 13 Republicans
are behind closed doors.

00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:37.960
They're not currently.

00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:40.240
They're in recess.

00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:47.500
But they're trying to
come up with something.

00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:48.610
We should be doing this.

00:27:48.610 --> 00:27:49.972
There should be an open process.

00:27:49.972 --> 00:27:52.180
We should be doing it like
we did the Affordable Care

00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:54.492
Act, through committees.

00:27:54.492 --> 00:27:55.450
JAIME GREEN: All right.

00:27:55.450 --> 00:27:58.054
We're going to open it
up to questions now.

00:27:58.054 --> 00:27:58.990
AUDIENCE: Hi, Senator.

00:27:58.990 --> 00:27:59.890
Thank you for coming.

00:27:59.890 --> 00:28:00.980
AL FRANKEN: Sure, thank you.

00:28:00.980 --> 00:28:03.646
AUDIENCE: I imagine you probably
get this question all the time,

00:28:03.646 --> 00:28:05.940
but for people who
are not politics

00:28:05.940 --> 00:28:11.530
are going in the US right
now, what can we do about it?

00:28:11.530 --> 00:28:16.875
AL FRANKEN: If you're
not happy, get involved.

00:28:16.875 --> 00:28:17.375
Get engaged.

00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:25.160
Throwing your hands up and
saying things are terrible

00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:30.980
is not a way to make
our system work better.

00:28:30.980 --> 00:28:37.820
It just leaves it to the people
who are cynical and don't care.

00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:46.170
So I am very much heartened by
the reaction that we've had.

00:28:46.170 --> 00:28:51.320
The Women's March on Washington
was an amazing event.

00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:56.510
And people going to town
hall meetings, I think,

00:28:56.510 --> 00:29:01.160
helped defeat the
House health care

00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:06.650
bills that were the predecessor
to this horrible bill.

00:29:06.650 --> 00:29:13.200
But get involved in
an advocacy group.

00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:18.400
If you care about
mental health, then

00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:21.550
advocate for funding
for mental health

00:29:21.550 --> 00:29:24.700
or getting more mental
health providers.

00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:27.370
If you care about
climate change,

00:29:27.370 --> 00:29:31.620
an existential threat to us
all, get involved in that.

00:29:31.620 --> 00:29:33.820
And you'll be
surprised, you become

00:29:33.820 --> 00:29:35.890
a foot soldier in
an organization,

00:29:35.890 --> 00:29:38.230
how quickly you
become an officer

00:29:38.230 --> 00:29:40.330
and how quickly you're
lobbying Congress.

00:29:40.330 --> 00:29:41.630
And it makes a difference.

00:29:41.630 --> 00:29:42.745
It really does.

00:29:42.745 --> 00:29:43.764
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:29:43.764 --> 00:29:44.680
AL FRANKEN: Thank you.

00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:46.634
JAIME GREEN: You said
earlier that your sort

00:29:46.634 --> 00:29:48.925
of overarching goal is to
serve the people of Minnesota

00:29:48.925 --> 00:29:51.250
when you're in the Senate.

00:29:51.250 --> 00:29:55.300
How much do phone calls or
emails from your constituents

00:29:55.300 --> 00:29:56.560
influence your work?

00:29:56.560 --> 00:29:57.530
AL FRANKEN: They do.

00:29:57.530 --> 00:29:59.890
And the ones that make
the biggest difference

00:29:59.890 --> 00:30:03.760
are the ones that clearly aren't
liked from some AstroTurf group

00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:07.550
where you get the
same written email.

00:30:07.550 --> 00:30:14.445
If you're writing a actual--
but they make a difference.

00:30:14.445 --> 00:30:15.870
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:30:15.870 --> 00:30:16.940
I'm Joy.

00:30:16.940 --> 00:30:19.715
I actually graduated last
year from Carleton College.

00:30:19.715 --> 00:30:21.100
AL FRANKEN: Oh, great school.

00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:22.040
AUDIENCE: And
speaking of getting

00:30:22.040 --> 00:30:23.965
involved, I've actually
been to your office

00:30:23.965 --> 00:30:26.785
multiple times with Sam and
Sylvia and other [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:26.785 --> 00:30:27.680
delegations.

00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:31.694
I was really excited to
hear that you were coming.

00:30:31.694 --> 00:30:33.110
I am sort of
curious, because when

00:30:33.110 --> 00:30:35.480
I speak to a lot
of people my age,

00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:37.280
they're starting to lose faith.

00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:38.870
They're going out
to these marches

00:30:38.870 --> 00:30:41.920
and going to town halls,
and it seems to them

00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:45.050
like the Democratic
Party, in a lot of ways,

00:30:45.050 --> 00:30:47.330
is playing defense.

00:30:47.330 --> 00:30:50.130
And that, to a certain
extent, makes sense

00:30:50.130 --> 00:30:51.620
for where we are right now.

00:30:51.620 --> 00:30:55.040
I'm curious if you could speak
to any coordinated efforts

00:30:55.040 --> 00:30:58.506
on behalf of the party to
really go back on the offense

00:30:58.506 --> 00:31:00.380
and take back some power,
rather than waiting

00:31:00.380 --> 00:31:03.274
until the elections in 2018.

00:31:03.274 --> 00:31:04.690
AL FRANKEN: Well,
we have a system

00:31:04.690 --> 00:31:08.590
and elections have consequences,
so it's hard for us

00:31:08.590 --> 00:31:09.520
to be on offense.

00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:11.050
We're on offense
in our messaging.

00:31:11.050 --> 00:31:13.300
We're on offense in many ways.

00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:17.200
But we are in the
minority in both houses,

00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:22.045
and the White House is
controlled by Donald Trump's

00:31:22.045 --> 00:31:23.390
the president.

00:31:23.390 --> 00:31:25.420
So we--

00:31:25.420 --> 00:31:28.120
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:28.825 --> 00:31:30.220
I try to play offense.

00:31:30.220 --> 00:31:32.711
I try to play offense
in the hearings.

00:31:32.711 --> 00:31:34.752
AUDIENCE: Are there
cooridnated efforts, thougth?

00:31:34.752 --> 00:31:37.608
Because I see you
playing offense,

00:31:37.608 --> 00:31:41.529
and I see Senator Warren and
Keith Ellison playing offense.

00:31:41.529 --> 00:31:43.320
But are there coordinated
efforts to do so?

00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:45.900
AL FRANKEN: Yeah.

00:31:45.900 --> 00:31:49.482
Democrats sometimes have
problems with messaging.

00:31:49.482 --> 00:31:51.690
The way I like to put it--
and I put it in the book--

00:31:51.690 --> 00:31:54.810
is that our bumper
stickers always and with,

00:31:54.810 --> 00:31:56.700
continued on next
bumper sticker.

00:31:56.700 --> 00:31:58.484
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:02.500
I mean, it's not like we're
not trying, believe me.

00:32:05.030 --> 00:32:07.970
We're trying to be on
offense at all times.

00:32:07.970 --> 00:32:10.947
AUDIENCE: If that's the problem,
what are you doing to fix it?

00:32:10.947 --> 00:32:12.780
AL FRANKEN: What am I
going to do to fix it?

00:32:12.780 --> 00:32:22.470
I can only-- I myself am
doing my job the best I can,

00:32:22.470 --> 00:32:26.100
and I'm being as aggressive as
I can when it's appropriate.

00:32:26.100 --> 00:32:36.110
And in this book, I write
about victories that matter,

00:32:36.110 --> 00:32:38.960
that matter in people's lives.

00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:43.470
My first bill, I passed two
weeks after I got to Congress--

00:32:43.470 --> 00:32:49.010
my co-sponsor, Johnny Isakson,
a Republican from Georgia--

00:32:49.010 --> 00:32:53.090
was to get service
dogs to veterans

00:32:53.090 --> 00:32:56.780
from Iraq and
Afghanistan who have PTSD

00:32:56.780 --> 00:33:00.020
and traumatic brain injury
and other invisible wounds,

00:33:00.020 --> 00:33:05.010
because these dogs
help them tremendously.

00:33:05.010 --> 00:33:08.030
And that is, to me--

00:33:08.030 --> 00:33:14.180
I've gotten increased funding
for mental health in schools.

00:33:14.180 --> 00:33:19.010
That is an enormous victory for
me that I really care about.

00:33:21.830 --> 00:33:23.700
I'm on the offensive,
believe me.

00:33:23.700 --> 00:33:26.480
And we are on the offensive
on this health care

00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:28.640
bill, this terrible,
awful health care

00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:33.980
bill that has an $880 billion
cut in Medicaid-- which,

00:33:33.980 --> 00:33:37.670
the president said he
would never cut Medicaid.

00:33:37.670 --> 00:33:40.070
We're pointing that out.

00:33:40.070 --> 00:33:44.180
And people are freaked out
about it in rural Minnesota.

00:33:44.180 --> 00:33:45.420
I can tell you that.

00:33:45.420 --> 00:33:46.670
And all over Minnesota.

00:33:46.670 --> 00:33:49.820
But I'm Co-Chair of the
Rural Health Caucus,

00:33:49.820 --> 00:33:51.680
so I go all around
rural Minnesota.

00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:53.720
I'm on the offense.

00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:56.540
I'm doing the best I can.

00:33:56.540 --> 00:33:58.730
Chuck Schumer is
doing the best we can.

00:33:58.730 --> 00:34:00.950
Tom Perez is doing
the best he can.

00:34:00.950 --> 00:34:03.530
We will fall short and
disappoint you all the time.

00:34:03.530 --> 00:34:06.701
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:07.137 --> 00:34:07.970
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:34:07.970 --> 00:34:08.886
AL FRANKEN: Thank you.

00:34:08.886 --> 00:34:10.309
AUDIENCE: Thank you, senator.

00:34:10.309 --> 00:34:13.489
If you look at different
types of charts--

00:34:13.489 --> 00:34:15.290
if you look at charts
of income inequality,

00:34:15.290 --> 00:34:17.719
if you look at
charts that examine

00:34:17.719 --> 00:34:23.246
congressional legislation
compared to public opinion,

00:34:23.246 --> 00:34:24.620
and most importantly,
if you look

00:34:24.620 --> 00:34:30.710
at statistical data of outcomes
of congressional campaigns

00:34:30.710 --> 00:34:33.290
and congressional elections
versus the amount of money

00:34:33.290 --> 00:34:37.370
spent on the campaigns,
our democracy

00:34:37.370 --> 00:34:39.889
resembles more of an oligarchy.

00:34:39.889 --> 00:34:42.510
If you can say, as
you can in the States,

00:34:42.510 --> 00:34:45.380
that you can pretty much
predict with high accuracy

00:34:45.380 --> 00:34:48.500
the outcome of an election
based on the money spent on it,

00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:51.409
it's hard to claim that
this is a democracy,

00:34:51.409 --> 00:34:54.050
because the people's
opinion clearly matters

00:34:54.050 --> 00:34:57.290
much less than the money spent.

00:34:57.290 --> 00:35:00.880
Given that, it seems like
our democratic process

00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:04.080
is running with its hands
tied behind its back.

00:35:06.956 --> 00:35:10.550
How can we achieve
anything significant

00:35:10.550 --> 00:35:14.510
before we address this very
serious problem of campaign

00:35:14.510 --> 00:35:16.260
financing?

00:35:16.260 --> 00:35:21.140
And why do we not hear more
about this from Congress?

00:35:24.550 --> 00:35:26.710
AL FRANKEN: You know,
one of the worst

00:35:26.710 --> 00:35:32.200
parts of having Donald Trump
as president instead of Hillary

00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:35.890
Clinton is who they--

00:35:35.890 --> 00:35:43.300
we have Neil Gorsuch now
as the ninth justice.

00:35:43.300 --> 00:35:45.370
I was hoping that
Hillary would win--

00:35:45.370 --> 00:35:48.830
I fought very hard for her--

00:35:48.830 --> 00:35:50.890
so that we would
get a justice who

00:35:50.890 --> 00:35:54.580
would overturn
Citizens United, which

00:35:54.580 --> 00:36:02.410
is one of the most pernicious
decisions we've seen.

00:36:02.410 --> 00:36:06.370
It's interesting that Justice
Kennedy wrote the majority

00:36:06.370 --> 00:36:07.210
opinion in that.

00:36:07.210 --> 00:36:09.700
He said, this doesn't
present even the appearance

00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:10.360
of corruption.

00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:11.602
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:12.430 --> 00:36:16.360
And he said that
because of the internet,

00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:21.640
everyone will be able to
see who gave what to whom.

00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:24.610
He envisioned, and their
decision envisioned,

00:36:24.610 --> 00:36:26.320
disclosure.

00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:28.690
And we tried to get
disclosure done.

00:36:28.690 --> 00:36:32.600
And every Republican
voted against it.

00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:36.700
At that point, we had 15--
this is after Scott Brown had

00:36:36.700 --> 00:36:39.790
won in Massachusetts.

00:36:39.790 --> 00:36:42.640
They needed 41 and they had 41.

00:36:46.570 --> 00:36:49.780
You're absolutely
right about this.

00:36:49.780 --> 00:36:56.510
I mean, you can say that
Hillary spent more than Trump.

00:36:56.510 --> 00:36:58.660
And that was the big one.

00:36:58.660 --> 00:37:04.600
He got a lot of free
media, because people

00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:07.270
were entertained by him.

00:37:07.270 --> 00:37:10.270
But you're right.

00:37:10.270 --> 00:37:12.200
There's a book that
Sheldon Whitehouse

00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:14.870
has written called
"Captured," which

00:37:14.870 --> 00:37:22.640
talks about how big corporations
and big special interests

00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:25.020
have captured a
number of things--

00:37:25.020 --> 00:37:31.980
including, through campaign
finance stuff, our elections--

00:37:31.980 --> 00:37:34.040
the ability for people
to get in the court.

00:37:34.040 --> 00:37:40.600
Our regulatory agencies
sometimes get captured.

00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:42.335
The courts are captured.

00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:46.970
It's a problem.

00:37:46.970 --> 00:37:51.344
One thing I can say is that
most Americans agree with you.

00:37:51.344 --> 00:37:53.260
The vast majority of
Americans agree with you.

00:37:53.260 --> 00:37:57.140
But if you ask them, what's the
most important issue to you?

00:37:57.140 --> 00:37:59.560
It comes out eighth
or ninth or tenth.

00:37:59.560 --> 00:38:03.880
It is an existential threat.

00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:05.800
AUDIENCE: It should be first.

00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:09.010
So who's championing
this in the Senate?

00:38:09.010 --> 00:38:16.910
AL FRANKEN: Well, we are
fighting for reform and losing.

00:38:16.910 --> 00:38:19.210
But it's people like
Sheldon Whitehouse.

00:38:19.210 --> 00:38:21.170
It's people like--

00:38:21.170 --> 00:38:22.720
I've been in this fight.

00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:25.810
It's been Elizabeth
Warren, Bernie.

00:38:25.810 --> 00:38:30.910
I mean, Dick Durbin has always
led for public financing

00:38:30.910 --> 00:38:31.690
of elections.

00:38:31.690 --> 00:38:33.100
And I agree with that.

00:38:33.100 --> 00:38:37.330
I've been a co-sponsor of
his legislation to do that.

00:38:37.330 --> 00:38:40.170
We just don't have--

00:38:40.170 --> 00:38:42.190
the Republican Party
will not do this.

00:38:42.190 --> 00:38:49.265
So right now, we are
not winning that one.

00:38:49.265 --> 00:38:50.666
JAIME GREEN: OK, thanks.

00:38:50.666 --> 00:38:51.600
Over here?

00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:52.534
AUDIENCE: Hi, senator.

00:38:52.534 --> 00:38:53.470
Thanks for coming.

00:38:53.470 --> 00:38:57.292
You mentioned that you work with
a lot of lawyers in Congress.

00:38:57.292 --> 00:39:00.890
And I'm wondering if you think
that lawyers and prosecutors

00:39:00.890 --> 00:39:06.170
in particular are more
qualified to serve in Congress,

00:39:06.170 --> 00:39:09.770
or if perhaps lawyers are
sort of more accommodating

00:39:09.770 --> 00:39:13.880
of doublespeak and dishonesty
that I think frustrates

00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:15.020
us in politics.

00:39:15.020 --> 00:39:16.760
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:16.760 --> 00:39:20.915
AL FRANKEN: Well, a lot of
my colleagues are lawyers.

00:39:23.470 --> 00:39:26.150
And there's colleagues
that I admire tremendously

00:39:26.150 --> 00:39:28.760
who are lawyers, and
there are colleagues

00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:33.710
that I don't admire
tremendously who are lawyers.

00:39:33.710 --> 00:39:37.850
I think probably when Harry said
I'd be good on the committee

00:39:37.850 --> 00:39:39.890
because I'm not a
lawyer, I actually

00:39:39.890 --> 00:39:45.560
think that I play
a good role there.

00:39:45.560 --> 00:39:47.420
I think my training
as a satirist--

00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:53.780
I can spot inconsistencies.

00:39:53.780 --> 00:39:58.909
Satirists are trained in
a certain kind of way.

00:39:58.909 --> 00:40:00.950
And because of the books
I wrote, "Lies and Lying

00:40:00.950 --> 00:40:06.050
Liars Who Tell Them,"
[INAUDIBLE], or "Rush Limbaugh

00:40:06.050 --> 00:40:09.110
is a Big Fat Idiot and
Other Observations,"

00:40:09.110 --> 00:40:16.940
all very high-minded books
of satire, trained me.

00:40:16.940 --> 00:40:20.120
And that's why I think I've had
a high profile in my hearings,

00:40:20.120 --> 00:40:23.690
because I think I
know how to frame

00:40:23.690 --> 00:40:26.090
things because of
my training and know

00:40:26.090 --> 00:40:27.920
how to make something land.

00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:36.290
So we are making the laws, so
being a lawyer has its upside.

00:40:36.290 --> 00:40:37.970
But I think you're
right, I'd like

00:40:37.970 --> 00:40:40.220
to see people who
aren't lawyers.

00:40:40.220 --> 00:40:43.190
By the way, I want to just
say one thing very quickly.

00:40:43.190 --> 00:40:45.809
And I maybe shouldn't
be so quick about this.

00:40:45.809 --> 00:40:47.600
But I write it in the
book, because there's

00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:54.160
a lot of despair
hanging on the room.

00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:55.670
There's hope here.

00:40:55.670 --> 00:41:02.340
In 2004, we lost the White House
in a very, very close election.

00:41:02.340 --> 00:41:07.930
And George W. Bush,
I think by then,

00:41:07.930 --> 00:41:11.510
it was apparent that we had
really been lied into the war,

00:41:11.510 --> 00:41:14.300
that they had made the
decision to go to war

00:41:14.300 --> 00:41:16.970
and then kind of cooked
the books and the evidence

00:41:16.970 --> 00:41:18.390
to get us there.

00:41:18.390 --> 00:41:20.890
And that was a very
difficult defeat.

00:41:20.890 --> 00:41:23.150
But we came back.

00:41:23.150 --> 00:41:26.430
And it was because of things
like Air America, which

00:41:26.430 --> 00:41:27.620
I was a radio host for.

00:41:27.620 --> 00:41:31.820
It was things like
Media Matters, which

00:41:31.820 --> 00:41:34.190
answered the
right-wing messaging

00:41:34.190 --> 00:41:37.220
machine in a very
effective way, the Center

00:41:37.220 --> 00:41:41.580
for American Progress, a
progressive think tank.

00:41:41.580 --> 00:41:44.240
And in '06, we took
the Congress back.

00:41:44.240 --> 00:41:48.710
And in '08, we had Barack
Obama win the White House.

00:41:48.710 --> 00:41:54.370
And we had for a moment, for
a couple of months, 60 votes.

00:41:54.370 --> 00:41:59.370
So don't despair.

00:41:59.370 --> 00:42:01.959
Get active is what I'm saying.

00:42:01.959 --> 00:42:02.875
AUDIENCE: Hi, senator.

00:42:02.875 --> 00:42:04.270
Thanks for coming.

00:42:04.270 --> 00:42:07.105
So we hear a lot about
how the best way to resist

00:42:07.105 --> 00:42:09.230
the Trump administration,
the GOP's current agenda,

00:42:09.230 --> 00:42:12.015
is to call our congresspeople
and call our senators.

00:42:12.015 --> 00:42:14.140
So I live in New York City.

00:42:14.140 --> 00:42:15.885
And New York City
has very liberal

00:42:15.885 --> 00:42:17.402
congresspeople and
liberal senators,

00:42:17.402 --> 00:42:19.185
so I like calling
them is maybe not

00:42:19.185 --> 00:42:23.020
as effective as calling swing
representatives or swing

00:42:23.020 --> 00:42:23.520
senators.

00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:27.429
So do you have any suggestions
for effective ways for people

00:42:27.429 --> 00:42:28.970
like me who live in
liberal districts

00:42:28.970 --> 00:42:32.050
to put pressure on
members of Congress

00:42:32.050 --> 00:42:38.180
or to help Democrats win control
of the House back in 2018?

00:42:38.180 --> 00:42:39.530
AL FRANKEN: Well, yes.

00:42:39.530 --> 00:42:43.640
We have districts
in America that

00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:50.240
are very blue, like in
New York, or very red.

00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:52.820
If you look at a
map of the country,

00:42:52.820 --> 00:42:54.090
you know where those are.

00:42:54.090 --> 00:43:04.740
So I think you guys could
Google those pretty well, right?

00:43:04.740 --> 00:43:07.400
So some of you, I
think, are paid OK.

00:43:07.400 --> 00:43:13.952
And you can actually
give money to candidates

00:43:13.952 --> 00:43:15.410
who are running in
swing districts,

00:43:15.410 --> 00:43:19.040
for example, or to organizations
that believe in the things

00:43:19.040 --> 00:43:19.700
you believe in.

00:43:23.690 --> 00:43:25.250
When I talked
about advocacy, you

00:43:25.250 --> 00:43:28.040
can join advocacy
groups that speak

00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:31.890
to everybody if it's about
an issue that you care about.

00:43:31.890 --> 00:43:35.360
If you care about housing, if
you care about clean water,

00:43:35.360 --> 00:43:37.280
you can join
advocacy groups that

00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:39.200
are national advocacy groups.

00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:46.810
And then you're talking about
an issue that lobbies everybody

00:43:46.810 --> 00:43:49.220
in Congress or tries
to speak to everybody--

00:43:49.220 --> 00:43:52.530
and not only that, but
people in state houses

00:43:52.530 --> 00:43:55.280
and in local government.

00:43:55.280 --> 00:43:57.080
And all of that is
very, very important.

00:43:57.080 --> 00:44:00.320
There is an infinite
amount to do,

00:44:00.320 --> 00:44:03.340
and you can find something to do
if you work hard enough at it.

00:44:03.340 --> 00:44:11.090
But other than just call Chuck
Schumer, probably you're right.

00:44:11.090 --> 00:44:16.030
Chuck probably believes, or
Kirsten Gillibrand, probably--

00:44:16.030 --> 00:44:17.530
what I'm getting
is they probably

00:44:17.530 --> 00:44:18.770
already agree with you, yeah.

00:44:18.770 --> 00:44:19.670
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:44:19.670 --> 00:44:20.010
AL FRANKEN: Thank you.

00:44:20.010 --> 00:44:21.051
AUDIENCE: Hello, senator.

00:44:21.051 --> 00:44:23.520
Thank you for coming here today.

00:44:23.520 --> 00:44:25.480
I'm actually from
Minnesota myself,

00:44:25.480 --> 00:44:29.110
and it's really heartwarming
to see you looking out

00:44:29.110 --> 00:44:31.570
for the interests
of Minnesotans,

00:44:31.570 --> 00:44:35.760
bringing Minnesota
nice to the Senate.

00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:38.530
But I think there's
another group of people

00:44:38.530 --> 00:44:41.830
who could really use your help,
who could use some of the hope

00:44:41.830 --> 00:44:43.740
that you were talking about.

00:44:43.740 --> 00:44:45.940
And that's the people
in New York City.

00:44:45.940 --> 00:44:49.150
I'm wondering what we
can do here in New York

00:44:49.150 --> 00:44:51.630
to bring the spirit of
Minnesota to our everyday lives.

00:44:51.630 --> 00:44:54.039
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:54.039 --> 00:44:55.330
AL FRANKEN: Where are you from?

00:44:55.330 --> 00:44:57.140
AUDIENCE: Minneapolis,
northeast.

00:44:57.140 --> 00:44:58.348
AL FRANKEN: I've heard of it.

00:44:58.348 --> 00:45:00.995
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:02.795 --> 00:45:04.780
It starts from each of you.

00:45:04.780 --> 00:45:07.150
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:07.150 --> 00:45:10.250
I want each of you
to be nice today.

00:45:10.250 --> 00:45:14.200
I want it to emanate
from this Google campus.

00:45:14.200 --> 00:45:17.560
Every person can be nice.

00:45:17.560 --> 00:45:19.420
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:19.420 --> 00:45:24.070
But in Minnesota, you're
also passive aggressive.

00:45:24.070 --> 00:45:24.840
That's also--

00:45:24.840 --> 00:45:26.490
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:26.490 --> 00:45:31.460
And talk like this, kind
of [MINNESOTA ACCENT], hey,

00:45:31.460 --> 00:45:32.160
how you doin'?

00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:35.380
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:37.230 --> 00:45:38.170
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:45:38.170 --> 00:45:39.440
AL FRANKEN: You're welcome.

00:45:39.440 --> 00:45:42.346
[MINNESOTA ACCENT] So,
who do we got here?

00:45:42.346 --> 00:45:43.750
AUDIENCE: Oh, hi.

00:45:43.750 --> 00:45:46.270
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:45:46.270 --> 00:45:50.350
AUDIENCE: So Sergey Brin said
once in one of these talks

00:45:50.350 --> 00:45:51.700
in this room--

00:45:51.700 --> 00:45:55.510
so he had met Obama after
Obama's re-election,

00:45:55.510 --> 00:46:01.240
and he suggested to Obama that
the president disassociate from

00:46:01.240 --> 00:46:05.550
the Democratic Party, just
for the sake of breaking down

00:46:05.550 --> 00:46:07.940
the division between
the two parties--

00:46:07.940 --> 00:46:11.490
which is, like, probably,
obviously, ridiculous.

00:46:11.490 --> 00:46:15.730
But Sergey wasn't joking,
and obviously he's smart.

00:46:15.730 --> 00:46:18.130
So I'm just wondering,
he's getting

00:46:18.130 --> 00:46:22.870
at a real issue of how the
party barriers get in the way.

00:46:22.870 --> 00:46:27.012
So I'm wondering how
ridiculous you think that is.

00:46:27.012 --> 00:46:27.720
AL FRANKEN: Very.

00:46:27.720 --> 00:46:30.220
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:30.220 --> 00:46:31.710
Very ridiculous.

00:46:31.710 --> 00:46:34.850
In the book, I think--

00:46:34.850 --> 00:46:38.370
would you agree with
this-- that I kind of

00:46:38.370 --> 00:46:45.840
try to talk about how it
really is, how it really works.

00:46:45.840 --> 00:46:47.750
And not in a cynical way.

00:46:47.750 --> 00:46:49.550
JAIME GREEN: No.

00:46:49.550 --> 00:46:50.762
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:50.762 --> 00:46:52.470
AL FRANKEN: This is
how we're going to do

00:46:52.470 --> 00:46:54.730
the whole thing from now on.

00:46:54.730 --> 00:46:58.580
But that's just not
going to happen.

00:46:58.580 --> 00:47:00.000
That wasn't going to happen.

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:04.590
And the Republicans
had done everything

00:47:04.590 --> 00:47:07.110
they could to defeat him.

00:47:07.110 --> 00:47:09.960
And no, he was not
going to divorce himself

00:47:09.960 --> 00:47:11.681
from the Democratic Party.

00:47:11.681 --> 00:47:12.543
AUDIENCE: But what if
it's not a president?

00:47:12.543 --> 00:47:14.270
What if it's somebody
else in that situation?

00:47:14.270 --> 00:47:15.645
AL FRANKEN: Well,
people do that.

00:47:15.645 --> 00:47:18.900
I mean, Bernie Sanders is not a
member of the Democratic Party.

00:47:18.900 --> 00:47:21.090
So people are free to do that.

00:47:21.090 --> 00:47:22.200
And people do that.

00:47:22.200 --> 00:47:23.730
But I'm a Democrat.

00:47:23.730 --> 00:47:25.440
I'm a Democrat, because--

00:47:25.440 --> 00:47:28.640
and I start the book
about why I'm a Democrat.

00:47:28.640 --> 00:47:30.750
And I'm a Democrat.

00:47:30.750 --> 00:47:35.040
I grew up in St.
Louis Park, Minnesota.

00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:37.260
My dad didn't
graduate high school.

00:47:37.260 --> 00:47:38.700
He was a printing salesman.

00:47:38.700 --> 00:47:41.164
I grew up in a two-bedroom,
one-bath house.

00:47:41.164 --> 00:47:43.080
But I felt like the
luckiest kid in the world,

00:47:43.080 --> 00:47:45.540
because I was growing
up middle class,

00:47:45.540 --> 00:47:51.900
at the height of the middle
class, in the '50s in America

00:47:51.900 --> 00:47:54.360
in Minnesota in St.
Louis Park, and I

00:47:54.360 --> 00:47:57.700
felt like I could do
anything I wanted.

00:47:57.700 --> 00:48:02.700
And I don't feel like kids
feel that way today, maybe.

00:48:02.700 --> 00:48:05.450
But when I went to
college, I met my wife.

00:48:05.450 --> 00:48:07.200
And she didn't grow up that way.

00:48:07.200 --> 00:48:10.660
Her father died when
she was 18 months old.

00:48:10.660 --> 00:48:11.740
She had a younger sister.

00:48:11.740 --> 00:48:16.650
Her mom was widowed at
age 29 with five kids.

00:48:16.650 --> 00:48:19.410
And they made it because
of Social Security survivor

00:48:19.410 --> 00:48:21.240
benefits.

00:48:21.240 --> 00:48:24.120
Sometimes they didn't
have enough to eat.

00:48:24.120 --> 00:48:25.320
A lot of times.

00:48:25.320 --> 00:48:27.720
Sometimes the heat
was turned off.

00:48:27.720 --> 00:48:29.760
And this is in Portland, Maine.

00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:32.370
Sometimes the phone
was turned off.

00:48:32.370 --> 00:48:33.180
But they made it.

00:48:33.180 --> 00:48:35.270
And all the girls
went to college

00:48:35.270 --> 00:48:39.090
on combinations of Pell
grants, which at that time

00:48:39.090 --> 00:48:43.470
paid for about 80% of a
public college education,

00:48:43.470 --> 00:48:45.780
and scholarships.

00:48:45.780 --> 00:48:49.650
And my mother-in-law ended
up going to college when

00:48:49.650 --> 00:48:50.910
the youngest--

00:48:50.910 --> 00:48:53.960
there was one younger my wife.

00:48:53.960 --> 00:48:57.050
When the youngest went to high
school, she got a GI loan.

00:48:57.050 --> 00:49:00.720
Her husband fought
in World War II.

00:49:00.720 --> 00:49:04.350
And that allowed her
to go to college.

00:49:04.350 --> 00:49:05.850
She ended up being a teacher.

00:49:05.850 --> 00:49:07.845
She taught Title
I kids, poor kids,

00:49:07.845 --> 00:49:10.950
so all her loans were forgiven.

00:49:10.950 --> 00:49:13.200
They tell you in this
country to pull yourself up

00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:15.690
by the bootstraps.

00:49:15.690 --> 00:49:17.070
I think we all believe that.

00:49:17.070 --> 00:49:20.050
But first, you have
to have the boots.

00:49:20.050 --> 00:49:27.360
And the federal government
gave Franni's family the boots.

00:49:27.360 --> 00:49:28.950
And that's what we believe. in.

00:49:28.950 --> 00:49:33.200
We believe in creating
opportunity for everybody.

00:49:33.200 --> 00:49:35.930
And I think that
this president--

00:49:35.930 --> 00:49:40.950
witness his budget, witness
his health care legislation--

00:49:40.950 --> 00:49:43.770
doesn't believe that.

00:49:43.770 --> 00:49:47.322
And that's why I'm a Democrat.

00:49:47.322 --> 00:49:47.822
Yes?

00:49:47.822 --> 00:49:51.678
[APPLAUSE]

00:49:56.024 --> 00:49:57.440
AUDIENCE: First
of all, thank you,

00:49:57.440 --> 00:50:01.400
senator, for leading by
example and showing us

00:50:01.400 --> 00:50:05.330
that you can go from
commenting on the process

00:50:05.330 --> 00:50:07.280
to actually do something
and living that.

00:50:07.280 --> 00:50:08.090
So thank you.

00:50:08.090 --> 00:50:09.673
AL FRANKEN: Thank
you for saying that.

00:50:12.050 --> 00:50:14.300
AUDIENCE: In terms of advocacy
and what we care about,

00:50:14.300 --> 00:50:16.940
you could say a few
people in this room care

00:50:16.940 --> 00:50:19.240
a little bit about the
quality of information

00:50:19.240 --> 00:50:22.700
and how it's delivered.

00:50:22.700 --> 00:50:24.130
AL FRANKEN: Thank god.

00:50:24.130 --> 00:50:25.830
If you guys didn't, who would?

00:50:28.790 --> 00:50:32.450
AUDIENCE: There's a lot
of noise between all

00:50:32.450 --> 00:50:38.945
of the information out there and
how it gets to everyday people.

00:50:38.945 --> 00:50:43.460
And I'm very interested
to find out from you

00:50:43.460 --> 00:50:46.220
how you cut through all that.

00:50:46.220 --> 00:50:53.190
And which medium have you found
to be the most clearcut channel

00:50:53.190 --> 00:50:56.640
to get directly from what
you want to communicate

00:50:56.640 --> 00:50:58.380
to your constituents?

00:50:58.380 --> 00:51:02.585
Because I've seen how you've
done it through humor and books

00:51:02.585 --> 00:51:03.210
over the years.

00:51:03.210 --> 00:51:07.890
And on a personal note, what you
did on Air America radio with

00:51:07.890 --> 00:51:11.420
Janeane Garofalo-- and Rachel
Maddow was on right before

00:51:11.420 --> 00:51:11.920
you--

00:51:11.920 --> 00:51:15.230
that helped me
connect as a citizen.

00:51:15.230 --> 00:51:18.330
I was right out of college, just
started in the tech industry.

00:51:18.330 --> 00:51:19.836
And in terms of--

00:51:19.836 --> 00:51:22.500
I home-schooled myself and
went to community college

00:51:22.500 --> 00:51:24.960
and went to college, and
now I work at Google.

00:51:24.960 --> 00:51:28.760
20 years later-- it's my
20-year reunion this year--

00:51:28.760 --> 00:51:32.090
I now can afford to pay off my
student loans, 20 years later.

00:51:32.090 --> 00:51:34.970
I'm doing it this year in
honor of my 20-year reunion.

00:51:34.970 --> 00:51:38.040
The things that you connected
to me through radio,

00:51:38.040 --> 00:51:40.830
through just an
audio channel alone,

00:51:40.830 --> 00:51:42.960
felt like an audience
of one to me,

00:51:42.960 --> 00:51:47.040
like I got the most
as a citizen from you,

00:51:47.040 --> 00:51:48.750
and you weren't
even a senator yet.

00:51:48.750 --> 00:51:52.960
So now, as a senator, you speak
directly to your constituents,

00:51:52.960 --> 00:51:53.460
I imagine.

00:51:53.460 --> 00:51:56.964
You also speak through
the dehumanizer.

00:51:56.964 --> 00:51:58.380
What's the most
effective channel,

00:51:58.380 --> 00:52:02.160
and how do you connect with
your constituents the most

00:52:02.160 --> 00:52:06.510
and how do you cut
through all that?

00:52:06.510 --> 00:52:12.800
AL FRANKEN: Ed, my
communications chief, is here.

00:52:12.800 --> 00:52:15.780
We try to use any tool we can.

00:52:15.780 --> 00:52:17.015
We try to use social media.

00:52:21.020 --> 00:52:25.460
I try to do it when
I have a platform.

00:52:25.460 --> 00:52:30.620
And if I have a platform
in a hearing, I use it.

00:52:30.620 --> 00:52:32.270
Floor speeches.

00:52:32.270 --> 00:52:35.615
Speeches-- hopefully this
is going to reach people.

00:52:39.600 --> 00:52:42.990
This is why net
neutrality, to me,

00:52:42.990 --> 00:52:48.540
is a huge First
Amendment issue, and why

00:52:48.540 --> 00:52:51.810
I believe that
people have to fight

00:52:51.810 --> 00:52:56.460
what the FCC is
trying to reverse,

00:52:56.460 --> 00:52:58.350
the open internet rule.

00:52:58.350 --> 00:53:03.160
And I think this is
very, very dangerous.

00:53:03.160 --> 00:53:07.200
We've always had net
neutrality on the internet.

00:53:07.200 --> 00:53:09.210
And it's from the
very beginning,

00:53:09.210 --> 00:53:13.830
when it was the arpanet--

00:53:13.830 --> 00:53:19.200
I'm sorry, when
DARPA had started it,

00:53:19.200 --> 00:53:27.070
we need to preserve that
so that all information is

00:53:27.070 --> 00:53:28.570
treated equally.

00:53:28.570 --> 00:53:30.860
I think that's
absolutely essential.

00:53:30.860 --> 00:53:33.480
And we can't have huge
corporate interests,

00:53:33.480 --> 00:53:35.770
and especially internet
service providers,

00:53:35.770 --> 00:53:39.280
deciding what information
gets to flow free

00:53:39.280 --> 00:53:42.940
and what you have to
pay for, et cetera.

00:53:42.940 --> 00:53:47.230
So again, it's also
an existential issue.

00:53:47.230 --> 00:53:49.150
We have many
existential issues--

00:53:49.150 --> 00:53:54.340
campaign finance
reform, net neutrality,

00:53:54.340 --> 00:53:55.770
climate change for God's sakes.

00:54:00.180 --> 00:54:01.810
We haven't discussed that.

00:54:01.810 --> 00:54:06.750
We're at Google, so we
should be discussing this.

00:54:06.750 --> 00:54:09.090
So that's one thing I've
been leading the charge on,

00:54:09.090 --> 00:54:11.760
is net neutrality.

00:54:11.760 --> 00:54:15.690
I try to get my message
out any way I can.

00:54:15.690 --> 00:54:20.490
And if you have anybody here
that can help us, let us know.

00:54:20.490 --> 00:54:21.360
OK?

00:54:21.360 --> 00:54:22.020
Thank you.

00:54:22.020 --> 00:54:23.700
And thanks for the
really kind words.

00:54:23.700 --> 00:54:24.882
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:54:24.882 --> 00:54:26.340
JAIME GREEN:
Unfortunately, I think

00:54:26.340 --> 00:54:28.330
that's all we have
time for today.

00:54:28.330 --> 00:54:31.860
But thank you so much, senator,
for coming in to talk with us.

00:54:31.860 --> 00:54:35.810
[APPLAUSE]
