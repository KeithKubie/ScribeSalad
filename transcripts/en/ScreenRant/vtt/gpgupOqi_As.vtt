00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.090
With Hollywood studios hurrying to get as
many superhero blockbusters as possible into

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:14.870
production, everyone is looking for the next
sure thing - and fans are casting doubt on

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:16.740
some before they're even off the ground.

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.040
But the truth is, sometimes the stories least
likely to succeed turn out to be the biggest

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:22.040
hits.

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.950
Here are Screen Rant's Amazing Superhero Movies
That Surprised Everyone.

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:28.010
Batman
In the 1990s, the most famous version of Batman

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:31.020
outside of the comic books was the campy Adam
West TV show.

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:33.630
So a big screen version of the hero was going
to try something different.

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.680
A little too different for most fans.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.660
So when Tim Burton landed the job as director,
the man behind PeeWee's Big Adventure seemed

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.910
like a guaranteed flop - especially when he
cast the comic actor Michael Keaton as Batman.

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.880
Everyone knows those fans were 100% wrong:
not only was the movie a blockbuster hit,

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.600
but it paved the way for a darker superhero
story.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:56.220
And Keaton surprised critics even more, becoming
the quintessential Batman for entire generations.

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:59.550
X-Men
Back in the year 2000, the idea of superheroes,

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.130
or even a superhero team dominating the blockbuster
market was unheard of - let alone a team of

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:05.640
mutated outcasts in black leather.

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:11.780
But director Bryan Singer didn't see the X-Men
as heroes, or a franchise: just a cool story.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.829
Imagining the battle for mutant freedom as
an allegory for the Civil Rights movement

00:01:14.829 --> 00:01:19.060
- with Magneto and Professor X filling in
for Martin Luther King and Malcolm X - the

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:20.060
movie was a hit.

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.580
It kicked off a series, and the superhero
genre as a whole, while making more than a

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.820
few overnight superstars along the way.

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.070
Spider-Man
Adapting a team of mutants into a popcorn

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.480
thriller is one thing, but adapting a hero
as iconic and effects-heavy as Spider-Man?

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:37.240
The job seemed impossible, especially with
the supremely un-hunky or musclebound Tobey

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:38.550
Maguire in the lead role.

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:42.330
But Sony and director Sam Raimi didn't back
down from the challenge, showing big screen

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.680
superheroics were finally possible, and setting
the mold for almost every superhero origin

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:47.680
movie to follow.

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.470
The film franchise has ran into trouble since
then, but starting with such a massive success

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.740
wasn't predicted by anyone.

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.740
The Avengers
The Marvel fans saw a dream come true as the

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:01.010
movie versions of Iron Man, Thor, Captain
America and Hulk were all set to join up for

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:04.710
a team adventure - but it's easy to forget
that at the time, nobody knew how the idea

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:05.710
would play out.

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.250
Would there be enough time for each hero to
shine?

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.270
Could a threat arrive that actually tested
their total talents?

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:13.840
And could Joss Whedon successfuly manage a
blockbuster with so much riding on it?

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.420
The answer was yes, across the board.

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.910
The Avengers delivered on every hope, locking
Marvel's movie universe in place, and putting

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.249
Whedon in charge of guiding every one of their
sequels.

00:02:23.249 --> 00:02:26.700
Captain America: The Winter Soldier
The biggest question mark of Marvel's Phase

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.859
2 was Captain America's first solo movie set
in the modern era.

00:02:29.859 --> 00:02:34.250
He helped launch The Avengers, but needed
a brand new story to make a solo series worthwhile.

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.090
He got one in The Winter Soldier, with the
massive reveal that SHIELD had been infiltrated

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.659
by the enemy of his first movie, eventually
bringing the agency down, and spinning the

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:44.349
TV show based in its universe on a new path.

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:48.629
Most surprising was the directors, whose experience
on shows like Community and Arrested Development

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:50.909
seemed a bad fit for superheroes.

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:55.150
That was dead wrong: The Winter Soldier was
one of the slickest action movies Marvel ever

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.919
made, with the Russos - and Cap - in the driver's
seat for Marvel's Phase 3.

00:02:59.919 --> 00:03:03.409
Batman Begins
After Joel Schumacher's neon, nippled Batsuits

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:06.849
basically killed the Batman movie series,
there were some who thought it would take

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:08.730
a decade for the sting to wear off.

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.230
Instead, Warner Bros. moved on with a new
spin from director Christopher Nolan.

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.040
The cerebral, brooding director seemed to
be just as strange a choice as Burton had,

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.029
and his pick of a unknown Welsh actor for
the lead role doomed the project for a lot

00:03:20.029 --> 00:03:21.029
of fans.

00:03:21.029 --> 00:03:23.189
They were left eating their words, as Batman
Begins - and Christian Bale - delivered a

00:03:23.189 --> 00:03:26.920
wildly successful version of The Dark Knight
for a brand new generation.

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.650
Not to mention setting the stage for one of
the best comic book films - and versions of

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.939
Batman's famous enemy, the Joker - that may
ever be made.

00:03:34.939 --> 00:03:38.170
Superman
The tagline of this 1978 movie says it all:

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:39.689
"You'll Believe a Man Can Fly."

00:03:39.689 --> 00:03:43.909
Back then, that promise alone was enough to
convince movie fans they were in for a revolution

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:44.909
in movie-making.

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:48.749
It's hard to imagine there ever being a time
when a Superman movie seemed impossible, especially

00:03:48.749 --> 00:03:51.340
one that actually featured polished versions
of his superpowers.

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.949
But the movie delivered on the promise, and
then some.

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:56.310
The biggest surprise was the star, Christopher
Reeve.

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.010
The grinning unknown actor may have been the
only person capable of pulling off the role,

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:02.109
proving to be as much of a hero off-screen
as on.

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:06.579
Forget a surprise: for its place and time,
Superman was, and is, one of the best superhero

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:07.909
films ever made.

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:11.670
Iron Man
Sure, Tony Stark is a box office veteran these

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:14.419
days, the same as the insanely successful
actor who plays him.

00:04:14.419 --> 00:04:18.299
But when Marvel first tried to bring its B-level
superhero to the big screen, it was hard to

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:19.299
understand why.

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:22.990
A millionaire in a suit of armor with shrapnel
in his chest seemed like the worst hero to

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:27.020
build a movie around, and casting Robert Downey,
Jr - best known for his drug problems - seemed

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:28.820
to condemn the entire project.

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:32.790
Fans know how this one played out, with Downey,
Stark, and director Jon Favreau turning in

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:34.740
what still might be Marvel's best movie.

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.850
It's a good thing, too - the entire Marvel
Universe was riding on it.

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:42.060
Guardians of the Galaxy
Even with Marvel's Avengers a worldwide hit,

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:46.001
and even with the studio's bet on underdog
Joss Whedon paying off and then some, the

00:04:46.001 --> 00:04:49.630
announcement that Guardians of the Galaxy
was actually going to be made seemed too weird

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:50.630
to be true.

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:54.900
Cap, Thor, and Iron Man, sure - but making
a team of green-skinned aliens, a talking

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:56.450
raccoon and walking tree work?

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:00.441
With director James Gunn in charge, the movie
would be unforgettable, but probably not a

00:05:00.441 --> 00:05:01.441
mainstream hit.

00:05:01.441 --> 00:05:05.240
Defying even the highest hopes, Guardians
wound up having one of Marvel's biggest box

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:09.040
office runs ever, proving even the weirdest
stories can be a billion-dollar property,

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.010
if it's told the right way.

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:14.160
Deadpool
Some comic books are especially hard to adapt:

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:18.090
so complicated or fantastic that developing
a movie script is impossible.

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:21.160
That wasn't the case with Deadpool, though:
the Merc with a Mouth's movie was put into

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.860
development hell by some Fox executives.

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:30.090
After years of re-writes, a PG-13 version
of the story, and with a budget of just $58

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:34.570
million, star Ryan Reynolds blew the doors
off the box office, beating some of Marvel's

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:38.000
heaviest box office hitters, and becoming
one of the highest-grossing R-Rated movies

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.000
EVER.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.670
Since Deadpool could have proven skeptics
wrong with just a fraction of that success,

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:43.960
it takes the cake.

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:47.160
Those are the superhero movies that people
doubted the most, eventually turning out to

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:50.000
beat the odds, and create entire franchises
in the process.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.750
