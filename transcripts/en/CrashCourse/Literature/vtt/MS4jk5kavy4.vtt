00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
Hi, I'm John Green, welcome to
Crash Course Literature!

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:11.320
You can tell I'm an English teacher because I'm wearing a sweater, but you tell I'm the kind of English teacher who wants to be your friend because I'm wearing awesome sneakers.

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.140
This is actually season two of
Crash Course Literature.

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:14.700
If you want to watch season one, you can
do so over here.

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.260
It's season four of Crash Course Humanities –
it might even be like, season 7 or 8 if you count
all the science stuff.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.860
Whatever let's just get started!

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:29.160
[Theme Music]

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.280
We're going to start at the beginning of literature,
or, at least, a beginning of literature.

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:39.240
Sing in me, Muse, and through me tell the
story of a man who lets all his shipmates die,

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.800
lies to everyone he meets, cheats on his
wife with assorted nymphs,

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.720
and takes 10 years to complete a voyage that, according to Google Maps, should have taken 2 weeks.

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.200
That man is, of course, one of the great
heroes of the ancient world.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.780
Ladies and gentlemen, meet Odysseus,
star of Homer’s The Odyssey.

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.020
Did I just say the odd at sea?

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.140
That’s a good pun.
Not in the original Greek though.

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.540
Now everyone knows that you can’t properly
enjoy a book until you know a lot about its author,

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:11.300
so before we discuss The Odyssey, we’re going to begin with a biographical sketch of Homer, the legendary blind poet of ancient Greece. What’s that?

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.160
Apparently we know nothing about him.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.740
Well, in fact we know that whoever wrote them didn’t actually write them, because they were composed orally.

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:19.140
And was Homer even blind?

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.440
Well, there are some verses about blindness in the Homeric Hymns and there’s a blind bard who appears in The Odyssey,

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.760
But if authors only wrote about characters
who were like themselves, then James Joyce’s

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:32.740
characters would have all had one eye, and I would
be an astonishingly handsome seventeen-year-old.

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.900
As for the subject of Homer’s poems, archeological
evidence tells us that the Trojan War occurred

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:44.080
around the twelfth century BCE, although it
probably included far fewer gods and similes
than in the epics based on it.

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.940
Then again, maybe not;
it’s not like we have pictures.

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:52.920
Anyway, Homer composed The Iliad and
The Odyssey in the eighth century BCE,
so centuries after the events it describes.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.840
And then no one bothered to write them
down for another 200 years,

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.780
which means that they probably changed a lot
as they were passed down via the oral tradition,

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.840
and even today there are arguments about
which parts are original and which parts are additions.

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.600
There were a lot of competing poems about the
Trojan War, but Homer’s were by far the most famous,

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:15.700
and they are now the most famous
because they were also the only ones to survive
the burning of the Library at Alexandria.

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:21.560
So The Iliad and The Odyssey are epic poems,
and we define an epic as “a long narrative poem;

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:28.500
on a serious subject; written in a grand or
elevated style; centered on a larger-than-life hero.”

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.300
By the way, that was an example of dactylic
hexameter, just like you see in epic poems.

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:38.520
So the events of The Odyssey take place
after those of The Iliad, so let’s have a brief
recap Thought Bubble.

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:44.040
So Helen, the wife of Menelaus, runs off with Paris, a Trojan prince; or maybe she’s abducted, it’s not clear.

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:49.940
Anyway, Menelaus’s brother Agamemnon gathers
allies and goes to Troy to get her back, but the war
drags on for ten years.

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.640
At which point everyone is really tired and
bored and wants to go home,

00:02:53.640 --> 00:03:01.300
until things suddenly get pretty tense because Agamemnon seizes a concubine of Achilles’ and Achilles gets really angry and says he won’t fight anymore.

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:05.980
And things go really badly for the Greeks
until Patroclus – Achilles’ best friend and
maybe also lover, it’s not clear –

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:12.140
goes into battle in his place and does a pretty awesome job until he’s slain by Hector, the Trojans’ great warrior.

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.860
Which forces Achilles to reconcile himself
with his own mortality,

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.540
and return to the field where he becomes
the ultimate death-dealing machine,

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:23.560
slaying hordes of Trojans including Hector,
whose body he drags behind his chariot
because that’s how Achilles rolls,

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.000
until Hector’s father, Priam, comes and
begs for his son’s corpse and Achilles relents

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.240
and they have dinner together, and then the book ends
with the war still going on and nothing really resolved.

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:33.600
And that’s The Iliad.

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:38.160
When The Odyssey opens, it’s 10 years
later, and everyone is already back home
except for Odysseus.

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:44.840
His son Telemachus and his wife Penelope
don’t know if he’s dead or alive, but Homer
reveals that he’s on the Isle of Ogygia.

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:50.900
Imprisoned by the nymph Calypso, who’s so hot for Odysseus even though he  pends his days laying on the beach and crying that she won’t let him go.

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:57.660
But finally the gods intervene and after a series of adventures and a whole lot of backstory he finally returns home to Ithaca in disguise,

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:03.740
and kills several dozen suitors who have been
drinking all of his wine, eating his beeves, annoying
his wife and plotting to kill his son.

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:07.420
And it seems like a cycle of violence is just
going to continue on, probably forever,

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:11.940
until the goddess Athena who loves Odysseus
intervenes and restores peace. The end.

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:17.420
Thanks, Thought Bubble. So, some of the big
questions around The Odyssey are Odysseus’
heroic characteristics,

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:22.960
the epic’s double standard for women, and whether
you can ever actually stop a cycle of violence.

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:29.180
Odysseus hardly appears in The Iliad and he’s not a particularly great fighter; in fact, he’s a pretty sleazy guy.

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:33.940
He leads a night raid into the enemy
camp and kills a bunch of sleeping Trojans.

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:35.900
That’s not particularly glorious.

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:40.200
But it is typical of Odysseus, who will pretty
much do whatever it takes to survive.

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:45.300
I mean, his distinguishing quality is metis,
which means skill, or cunning.

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.440
Odysseus is smart; he’s really smart.

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:54.260
I mean, he’s an incredibly persuasive speaker and he can talk his way out of the stickiest of situations, even ones
that involve, like, Cyclopses.

00:04:54.260 --> 00:05:03.400
He’s also kind of a monster of self-interest, and if he weren’t so smug and overconfident he might have gotten home in less than, you know, like, a gajllion years.

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:07.340
The best example of this is probably Odysseus’
encounter with the Cyclops.

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:10.400
So Odysseus and his men land on the
island of the Cyclops,

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:18.340
and he and several of his guys settle into the Cyclops’ cave, feasting on the delicious goat cheese that the Cyclops has hoarded,

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:24.740
and then, expecting the Cyclops to return
and offer them gifts, because that’s what you
do when someone breaks into your house.

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:29.300
I mean yes, there was an ancient Greek tradition
of hospitality, but that’s taking it pretty far;

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:36.160
and for the record, it’s also pretty much
exactly what the suitors are doing in Odysseus’
house, for which he kills them.

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:40.560
So the Cyclops comes home and he’s so thoroughly
not psyched about these guys in his cave that

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:47.020
he begins to eat them, and in response
Odysseus gets the Cyclops drunk and then
blinds him with a flaming spear,

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:49.580
which is fairly easy to do because of
course he only has one eye.

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:53.240
Odysseus has given his name as Noman,
so when the Cyclops cries out,

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:56.480
“No man is hurting me! No man is killing me!”

00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:01.120
the other Cyclopes don’t come to his aide, because you know they think there’s no man hurting him.

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:03.140
It’s a pun. It’s a blindingly good pun.

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:07.560
But then when it seems like Odysseus might get away
with it, he can’t tolerate the idea that

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:16.620
“no man” is going to get the credit so he announces his actual name, causing the Cyclops to call down curses on him, which culminates in all of his men being killed.

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:22.140
Just as a rule of thumb, you do not want to
be friends with Odysseus, and you also don’t 
want to be his enemy. Just stay away.

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:26.780
So Odysseus is a trickster and a liar and
a pirate and a serial adulterer,

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:33.060
and he’s responsible for the death of a lot
of people, and he also has probably the worst
sense of direction in all of Greek literature.

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:34.980
But is he a hero?
Yes.

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:42.520
To the Greeks, heroism didn’t mean perfection, it meant that you had an extraordinary attribute or ability, and Odysseus definitely does.

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:46.100
It’s not for nothing that he’s the favorite of
Athena, the goddess of wisdom.

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:54.820
I mean, she applauds all of his tricks and stratagems, and she encourages us to applaud them too, even though from our contemporary perspective, he’s a pretty shady dude.

00:06:54.820 --> 00:07:00.520
Speaking of contemporary perspective,
one of Odysseus’ least stellar qualities is his
attitude toward women.

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:07.000
He’s really big on this sexual double standard in which the exact same behavior types women as sluts and men as studs.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.080
Actually the whole epic in general is incredibly—wait, why is my desk moving?

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:13.700
Oh, the secret compartment is open.
It must be time for the open letter.

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:18.140
What have we got today? Well, it’s Medusa, a
representation of woman as a monstrous serpent.

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:22.380
An open letter to the patriarchy: how are
you so incredibly resilient?

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:24.260
Also, please explain something to me:

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:30.060
How is it that the only way for someone
to become like a good heroic strong man
is to have sex with lots of women,

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:34.580
but if a woman has sex with lots of men,
she’s like tainted and impure and horrible?

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:43.460
Patriarchy, I don’t want to get too deeply into math but in order for men to have sex with a lot of women, a lot of women have to have sex with men.

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:45.900
That’s it, that’s the only way, patriarchy!

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:52.640
So basically you’re saying that the only way
for men to achieve manliness is for women
to fail at womanliness!

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:56.820
It’s bad! Actually, it’s evil! I hate you!
Best wishes, John Green.

00:07:56.820 --> 00:08:00.520
Yeah, so the whole epic is incredibly paranoid
about female sexuality.

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:07.080
I mean the story that haunts The Odyssey is that of Agamemnon, the leader of the Achaeans, who returns victorious from the war,

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:09.760
only to be murdered by his wife
and her lover.

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:18.660
And then when they meet in the underworld, Agamemnon’s ghost warns Odysseus that he better come home in secret because Penelope might try and have him killed too.

00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:20.460
And the misogyny doesn’t end there;

00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:25.600
I mean this is a book full of monsters, and,
Cyclops aside, a lot of them are female;

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:31.460
like the Sirens who lure men too their deaths,
or Scylla, who’s basically an octopus with teeth.

00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:35.460
And then of course there’s Charybdis,
a hole that sucks men to their doom.

00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:39.300
You can explore the Freudian implications of that
one over at Crash Course Psychology.

00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:45.180
Meanwhile Odysseus sleeps with like every
manner of magical lady and nearly marries
an island princess,

00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:49.740
but he assures us that he was always true
to his wife “in his heart.”

00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:54.360
Which is nice, but it would be even nicer
if he were true to his wife in his pants.

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:58.570
Stan, who is ever the stickler for historical
accuracy, would like me to acknowledge that

00:08:58.570 --> 00:09:02.190
Odysseus didn’t wear pants because they
weren’t a thing in Greece yet, so he wasn’t

00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:05.260
true to his wife in like his toga or his loincloth
or whatever.

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:11.000
Anyway, even as he’s sleeping around,
Odysseus is incredibly concerned with whether
or not Penelope is chaste.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.360
If she isn’t, he’ll likely kill her.

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:18.880
After all, he later executes all the
housemaids for sleeping with the suitors,
and he’s not even married to them.

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:24.300
The epic seems like it’s building to a
climactic scene wherein Odysseus is going
to test Penelope’s faithfulness,

00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:27.760
but instead it’s Penelope who tests Odysseus.

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:31.060
When he reveals himself to her, she
doesn’t recognize him.

00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:41.080
She forces him to prove himself by speaking the secret of their marriage bed, and only then does she embrace
him in one of the most beautiful lines in all of Homer:

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:48.260
“And so she too rejoiced, her gaze upon her husband,
her white arms round him pressed as though forever.”

00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:52.600
Some ancient commentators believed the poem
should end right there like any good romance would,

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:56.120
with Odysseus and Penelope blissfully
reunited, but it doesn’t.

00:09:56.120 --> 00:10:00.520
See Odysseus and a couple of his friends, with a big assist from Athena, have slaughtered all the suitors,

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:04.380
and the serving maids, and that’s a problem,
because this isn’t The Iliad.

00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:05.620
They aren’t at war.

00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:10.380
The Iliad is a poem of war, and it’s
main concern is kleos, which means glory or

00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:16.020
renown achieved on the battlefield that guarantees
you a kind of immortality because your deeds

00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:19.440
are so amazing that everyone’s going to
sing about you forever.

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:21.960
Achilles didn’t get to go home.
He had two choices:

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:27.580
he could stay and fight and win glory, or he
could go home and live a long and quiet life.

00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:30.200
In The Iliad, Achilles went for glory.

00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:32.320
But The Odyssey is about the alternative.

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:36.360
It’s about what we do after a war,
how we put war away.

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:38.400
Odysseus isn’t particularly good at this.

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:41.540
He’s sort of an ancient example of Post
Traumatic Stress Disorder.

00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:44.560
He’s been through so much that he
doesn’t know how to adjust to peacetime;

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:50.160
his response to young men taking over his dining hall and barbecuing all of his pigs is mass slaughter.

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:58.160
And the slaughter of the suitors leads to their relatives coming to try to slaughter Odysseus, and if Athena
hadn’t descended from Olympus, conveniently,

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:03.180
and put a stop to it, pretty soon there would
have been no one left on Ithaca alive.

00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:05.300
And that’s a sobering final thought:

00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:11.620
if it weren’t for divine intervention, the humans in this story might have continued that cycle of violence
forever.

00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:19.660
The Odyssey is a poem set in peacetime, but it reminds us that humans have never been particularly good at leaving war behind them.

00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:24.760
Next week we’ll be discussing another story
with lots of sex and violence and Greeks: Oedipus.

00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:26.740
Thanks for watching. I’ll see you
then.
