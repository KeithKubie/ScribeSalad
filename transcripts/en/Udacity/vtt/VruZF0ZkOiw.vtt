When you drove the boat upstream and downstream, it took a total time of one

00:00:03.766 --> 00:00:08.856
hour. This means that if we add the time to go upstream to the time to go

00:00:08.856 --> 00:00:14.090
downstream, those should add to one. So, we'll add the time to go upstream to

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:19.446
the time to go downstream, and that should equal 1. Great thinking if you found

00:00:19.446 --> 00:00:22.580
this piece of information which you led you here.
