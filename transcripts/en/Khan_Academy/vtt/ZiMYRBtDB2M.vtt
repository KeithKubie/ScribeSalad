00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.828
- [Voiceover] So in the last video,

00:00:00.828 --> 00:00:03.348
I talked about
3-dimensional vector fields.

00:00:03.348 --> 00:00:04.149
And I finished things off

00:00:04.149 --> 00:00:06.250
with a sort of identity function example

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:09.803
where at an input point x, y, z

00:00:09.803 --> 00:00:12.485
the output vector is also x, y, z.

00:00:12.485 --> 00:00:13.924
And here, I want to go through

00:00:13.924 --> 00:00:16.596
a slightly more intricate example.

00:00:16.596 --> 00:00:19.776
So I'll go ahead and get
rid of this vector field

00:00:19.776 --> 00:00:21.540
and in this example,

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:26.521
the x component of the
output will be y times z.

00:00:26.521 --> 00:00:30.225
The y component of the
output will be x times z.

00:00:30.225 --> 00:00:34.625
And the z component of the
output will be x times y.

00:00:34.625 --> 00:00:36.227
So I'll just show this vector field

00:00:36.227 --> 00:00:38.914
and then we can start to get a feel for

00:00:38.914 --> 00:00:40.743
how the function that I just wrote

00:00:40.743 --> 00:00:42.868
relates to the vectors that you're seeing.

00:00:42.868 --> 00:00:43.843
So you see some of the vectors

00:00:43.843 --> 00:00:45.701
are kind of pointing away from the origin.

00:00:45.701 --> 00:00:48.209
Some are pointing in towards the origin.

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:52.353
So how can we understand this vector field

00:00:52.353 --> 00:00:54.478
in terms of the function itself?

00:00:54.478 --> 00:00:55.976
And a good step is to just zero in

00:00:55.976 --> 00:00:57.473
on one of the components.

00:00:57.473 --> 00:00:59.377
So in this case, I'll
choose the z component

00:00:59.377 --> 00:01:00.968
of the output

00:01:00.968 --> 00:01:03.035
which is made up of x times y

00:01:03.035 --> 00:01:03.975
and kind of start to understand

00:01:03.975 --> 00:01:04.869
what that should be.

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:06.552
The z component will represent

00:01:06.552 --> 00:01:08.851
how much the vector's pointing up or down.

00:01:08.851 --> 00:01:10.256
This is the z axis

00:01:10.256 --> 00:01:11.835
and the x-y plane here

00:01:11.835 --> 00:01:13.890
so I'll point the z axis
straight at our face.

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.374
This is the x axis, this is the y axis.

00:01:16.374 --> 00:01:18.859
The values of x and y are
going to completely determine

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:20.136
that z component.

00:01:20.136 --> 00:01:21.378
So I'm going to go off to the side here

00:01:21.378 --> 00:01:25.976
and just draw myself a little
x-y plane for reference.

00:01:25.976 --> 00:01:28.878
So this is my x value,

00:01:28.878 --> 00:01:30.353
this is my y value.

00:01:30.353 --> 00:01:31.688
And I want to understand the meaning

00:01:31.688 --> 00:01:35.008
of the term "x times y."

00:01:35.008 --> 00:01:37.412
So when both x and y are positive,

00:01:37.412 --> 00:01:39.617
the product is positive.

00:01:39.617 --> 00:01:40.976
And when both of them are negative,

00:01:40.976 --> 00:01:43.449
the product is also positive.

00:01:43.449 --> 00:01:45.469
If x is negative and y is positive,

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:46.874
the product is negative,

00:01:46.874 --> 00:01:48.778
but if x is positive and y is negative,

00:01:48.778 --> 00:01:50.670
the product is also negative.

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:51.436
So what this should mean,

00:01:51.436 --> 00:01:52.772
in terms of our vector field,

00:01:52.772 --> 00:01:54.292
is that when we're in this first quadrant,

00:01:54.292 --> 00:01:56.858
vectors tend to point
up in the z direction,

00:01:56.858 --> 00:01:59.419
same over here in the third quadrant.

00:01:59.419 --> 00:01:59.970
But over in the other two

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:01.479
they should tend to point down.

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:02.895
So let's focus in on that first quadrant

00:02:02.895 --> 00:02:04.614
and try to look at what's going on.

00:02:04.614 --> 00:02:07.075
So, you see like this vector
here applies, this vector.

00:02:07.075 --> 00:02:09.269
And all of them generally point upwards,

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:11.139
they have a positive z component.

00:02:11.139 --> 00:02:13.054
So that seems in line with
what we were predicting.

00:02:13.054 --> 00:02:13.960
Whereas over here,

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.574
which corresponds to the fourth quadrant

00:02:15.574 --> 00:02:16.653
of the x-y plane,

00:02:16.653 --> 00:02:19.835
the z component of each
vector tends to be down.

00:02:19.835 --> 00:02:22.040
And they're doing other things

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.515
in terms of the x and y components,

00:02:23.515 --> 00:02:24.920
it's not just z component action,

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.940
but right now we're just
focusing on up and down.

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.668
And if you look over
in the third quadrant,

00:02:29.668 --> 00:02:31.154
they tend to be pointing up,

00:02:31.154 --> 00:02:32.948
and that corresponds to the fact

00:02:32.948 --> 00:02:34.510
that x times y will be positive.

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:35.102
And when you look at it,

00:02:35.102 --> 00:02:36.785
it all starts to align that way.

00:02:36.785 --> 00:02:38.329
And because I chose a
rather symmetric function

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:40.047
you could imagine doing this where you,

00:02:40.047 --> 00:02:43.182
you analyze also the y component here,

00:02:43.182 --> 00:02:46.224
you analyze the x component
in terms of y and z,

00:02:46.224 --> 00:02:47.582
and it's actually going
to look very similar

00:02:47.582 --> 00:02:50.090
for understanding when the
x component of a vector

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:51.228
tends to be positive,

00:02:51.228 --> 00:02:51.924
like up here,

00:02:51.924 --> 00:02:53.085
or when it turns out to be negative,

00:02:53.085 --> 00:02:54.339
like over here,

00:02:54.339 --> 00:02:55.663
and same with when the y
component of the vector

00:02:55.663 --> 00:02:56.789
tends to be negative,

00:02:56.789 --> 00:02:58.949
or if the y component
tends to be positive.

00:02:58.949 --> 00:03:02.420
And overall, it's a very
complicated image to look at,

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:05.566
but you can slowly piece
by piece get a feel for it.

00:03:05.566 --> 00:03:07.203
And just like with
2-dimensional vector fields,

00:03:07.203 --> 00:03:08.387
the kind of neat thing to do

00:03:08.387 --> 00:03:11.046
is imagine that this
represents a fluid flow.

00:03:11.046 --> 00:03:12.822
So you imagine like maybe air around you,

00:03:12.822 --> 00:03:14.935
flowing in towards the origin here,

00:03:14.935 --> 00:03:17.048
flowing out away from the origin there,

00:03:17.048 --> 00:03:19.173
it would kind of be rotating around here,

00:03:19.173 --> 00:03:21.387
and later on in multi-variable calculus,

00:03:21.387 --> 00:03:23.399
you'll learn about
various ways you can study

00:03:23.399 --> 00:03:25.698
just the function itself
and just the variables

00:03:25.698 --> 00:03:28.519
and get a feel for how that
fluid itself would behave,

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:30.725
even though it's a very
complicated thing to think about,

00:03:30.725 --> 00:03:31.967
it's even complicated to draw

00:03:31.967 --> 00:03:33.581
or use graphic software with,

00:03:33.581 --> 00:03:35.299
but just with analytic tools,

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:38.762
you can get very powerful results.

00:03:38.762 --> 00:03:40.930
And these kind of things come
up in physics all the time

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:42.567
because you're thinking
in 3-dimensional space

00:03:42.567 --> 00:03:44.587
and it doesn't just have to be fluid flow,

00:03:44.587 --> 00:03:47.188
it could be a force field
like an electric force field

00:03:47.188 --> 00:03:48.836
or gravitational force field,

00:03:48.836 --> 00:03:49.765
where each vector tells you

00:03:49.765 --> 00:03:52.145
how a particle tends to get pushed.

00:03:52.145 --> 00:03:54.328
And as we continue on with
multi-variable calculus,

00:03:54.328 --> 00:03:56.337
you'll get to see lots more examples.

00:03:56.337 --> 00:03:57.695
But hopefully this helps give a small feel

00:03:57.695 --> 00:03:59.053
for how you can go piece by piece

00:03:59.053 --> 00:04:00.470
and understand something

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:03.149
that's kind of a complicated expression.
