00:00:01.061 --> 00:00:03.931
- [Voiceover] Jacob charges
$9.00 an hour to paint.

00:00:03.931 --> 00:00:06.291
The graph below shows the
number of hours he spent

00:00:06.291 --> 00:00:09.358
painting different rooms of one house.

00:00:09.358 --> 00:00:12.910
How much did Jacob charge
for painting the living room?

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:16.426
So here's the graph, this is a
picture graph, or pictograph,

00:00:16.426 --> 00:00:19.113
and it shows us how much
time Jacob spent painting

00:00:19.113 --> 00:00:21.765
different rooms of a house.

00:00:21.765 --> 00:00:24.967
One super important thing is
this little key right here

00:00:24.967 --> 00:00:27.527
that tells us each of these paint buckets

00:00:27.527 --> 00:00:29.444
is three hours of time.

00:00:30.986 --> 00:00:34.022
We're asked about the living room.

00:00:34.022 --> 00:00:37.242
On the graph, we can find
where it says living room

00:00:37.242 --> 00:00:39.322
and see how many buckets.

00:00:39.322 --> 00:00:42.147
Remember, each of these buckets

00:00:42.147 --> 00:00:44.397
equals three hours of time.

00:00:46.048 --> 00:00:48.786
He spent three hours,
plus another three hours,

00:00:48.786 --> 00:00:52.953
so he spent a total of six
hours painting the living room.

00:00:54.125 --> 00:00:58.292
But the question asks us,
how much did Jacob charge.

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:02.137
Jacob charges $9.00 for every hour,

00:01:03.651 --> 00:01:05.287
and he worked for six hours,

00:01:05.287 --> 00:01:08.581
so he charged $9.00 six times.

00:01:08.581 --> 00:01:11.895
$9.00 for each of the six hours he worked,

00:01:11.895 --> 00:01:13.228
which is a total

00:01:14.341 --> 00:01:15.174
of $54.00.

00:01:18.278 --> 00:01:22.445
Jacob charged a total of $54.00
to paint the living room.
