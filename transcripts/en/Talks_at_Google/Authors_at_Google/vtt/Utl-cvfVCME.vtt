00:00:01.927 --> 00:00:03.260
FEMALE SPEAKER: Hello, everyone.

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:05.044
Welcome, fellow
Googlers and guests.

00:00:05.044 --> 00:00:06.460
I am delighted to
introduce to you

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:10.180
today an extremely inspiring,
thoughtful, and genuine person,

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:13.230
the chairman and CEO
of The Container Store,

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.212
and the author of
"Uncontainable," Kip Tindell.

00:00:16.212 --> 00:00:18.420
Kip has been the helm
of The Container Store

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.670
since its stores opened
in Dallas in 1978.

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:24.190
This is the first store
that was devoted solely

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:26.800
to organizational
and storage products.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.712
The Container Store has
stores nationwide now

00:00:29.712 --> 00:00:30.670
and a thriving website.

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.960
But for Kip, the goal has never
been growth for growth's sakes,

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.000
but rather to adhere
to the company's

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.880
value-based foundation
principles, which

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.954
center around an employee-first
culture, superior customer

00:00:46.954 --> 00:00:48.370
service, and strict
merchandising.

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.220
In November 2013 under
Kip's leadership,

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.670
The Container Store
became a public company.

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.360
The primary reason
again for this being

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.000
to get more stock into
the hands of employees,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.030
to maximize the autonomy
for the company's culture

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.140
and management team and to
have a more visible stage

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.610
to create a conscious
company that

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.460
inspires others to emulate.

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.580
Kip is also very
actively involved

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.280
in the community, dedicating
time and resources

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.010
to the Salesmanship
Club of Dallas,

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:22.440
serving on the board
of Whole Foods Market.

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.020
He is also the first vice
chairman of the board,

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.060
chairman of finance
committee, and treasurer

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.280
of the National
Retail Federation.

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.940
And last, but certainly not
least, he is passionately

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.200
involved as a leader in
Conscious Capitalism, Inc.,

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.220
which is a community
of like-minded business

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.262
thought and academic leaders who
are working to elevate humanity

00:01:43.262 --> 00:01:44.970
through a conscious
approach to business.

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.430
And before Kip begins
telling us about his book,

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.900
we have a short video to watch.

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.220
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.860
-How do you build a business
where everyone can thrive?

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.630
By simultaneously creating
value for everyone involved.

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.960
For us, that starts
with our employees.

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.400
-Everything that
I do and don't do

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.539
matters and affects
someone around me.

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.370
And when you feel that kind of
responsibility, going to work

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:13.740
is exciting.

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.027
I can't wait to get up
and get my day started.

00:02:16.027 --> 00:02:18.360
That's what I love about
working at The Container Store.

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.900
I don't just sell products.

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.910
I solve problems by helping
our customers get organized,

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.170
which I know can
improve their lives.

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:26.930
I can really focus
on helping them,

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.010
because I get the communication,
training, and support I need

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.030
from the company, my managers
and team, I absolutely love--

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:35.730
-Walking into the store.

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.290
No matter what my
day's been like,

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.130
I can always find a little
bit of calm to take home.

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:42.490
The employees are so
happy and helpful,

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:44.150
you can't help but smile.

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.050
-And let me tell you, my kids
notice when I'm less stressed.

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.730
When I can find what I'm
looking for, I have more energy

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.425
and I can get everyone
out the door on time.

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.100
-The Container Store
is more like a--

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.680
- --friend than a company.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.620
I'm not just a vendor to them.

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.960
We're partners in success.

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.840
They looked beyond the fact that
I was just starting my business

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.430
and they saw the potential
in my product and in me.

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.490
Because of our
partnership, my business

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:12.370
has grown tremendously.

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.170
We've hired more people,
developed new products,

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:17.310
and even taken on a new factory.

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:18.420
Together--

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.760
- --we've impacted
so many lives.

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.110
Our unique partnership
over the years

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:26.830
has impacted the way
thousands of people

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:29.920
think about their minds--
increasing creativity,

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.010
organizing their minds, and
increasing their capacity

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:34.590
to think smarter.

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.860
Our connection with
The Container Store--

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:39.890
- --has helped us support
many conscious businesses.

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:42.750
Their commitment to their
foundation principles,

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.310
employee-first culture,
and conscious capitalism

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:48.710
is not just marketing spin.

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:50.400
It's making a difference.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.330
The idea that you can make
business decisions based

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:56.570
on love and still
be highly profitable

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:58.745
is gaining momentum
and credibility.

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:02.130
And profits aren't a bad thing.

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.050
They're what give
businesses the ability

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:06.600
to take better care
of their employees

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.160
and give more to
their communities.

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:10.830
It's not altruism.

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:14.510
It's capitalism being done
in a conscious way that

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:16.071
ensures everyone--

00:04:16.071 --> 00:04:17.029
- --All the customers--

00:04:19.183 --> 00:04:19.974
- --the employees--

00:04:22.645 --> 00:04:23.520
- --all the vendors--

00:04:26.117 --> 00:04:27.200
- --the entire community--

00:04:29.457 --> 00:04:30.540
- --and the shareholders--

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:34.065
- --can all thrive together.

00:04:40.563 --> 00:04:41.514
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:04:41.514 --> 00:04:42.930
FEMALE SPEAKER:
Now if you can all

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:45.690
help me in extending a warm
welcome to Kip Tindell.

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:46.190
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:47.660
KIP TINDELL: Thank you.

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:50.120
Thank you so much.

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.578
Well, that's what we're trying
to do at The Container Store

00:04:52.578 --> 00:04:55.005
is a create a business
where everyone thrives.

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:01.180
And we spend more time working
than any other waking endeavor.

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:03.470
And so I just
think it's probably

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:05.470
the best thing you can
do with all those hours

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:07.428
that you spend working,
create a business where

00:05:07.428 --> 00:05:08.340
everyone thrives.

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:11.520
And that means very much
in the conscious capitalist

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:15.420
stakeholder model, the employee
thrives, the community thrives,

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:18.080
the vendor thrives, the
shareholder thrives.

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:22.724
Everyone associated with
the business thrives.

00:05:22.724 --> 00:05:24.890
How many of you have shopped
at The Container Store?

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:27.700
OK, that's pretty good.

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:28.950
We have to work on you too.

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:38.440
Well, we began in 1978 with one
tiny little 1600-square-foot

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:44.590
store in Dallas, Texas, with
a whopping $35,000 in capital.

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:48.070
And somehow we knew--
I don't know how,

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:52.430
but somehow we
knew that-- I mean,

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:55.880
people think of The Container
Store as saving space,

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:57.050
getting you organized.

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:58.560
But what I think
we're really doing

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:01.580
is giving our customers
the gift of organization.

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:04.149
You really have no choice
but to be reasonably

00:06:04.149 --> 00:06:05.690
well-organized in
your life if you're

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:08.140
going to accomplish half of
what you want to accomplish.

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:11.400
Something as simple as getting
two children ready for school

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:13.530
in the morning is either
a nightmare or a pleasure,

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:15.990
depending upon how organized
you are and they are.

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:20.270
Traveling is so much
simpler if you're

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:21.850
reasonably well-organized.

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:24.960
So I really do feel like we're
giving the gift of an organized

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:26.795
life to our customers.

00:06:30.602 --> 00:06:32.310
It was interesting
starting the business.

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:37.190
I mean, my dad, who's like, he's
kind of a Texas oil man, right?

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:38.950
He was like, you're
going to open

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:40.380
a store that sells empty boxes?

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:42.690
I mean, he was really
concerned about all that.

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:45.270
But that's not really the
target customer at all.

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:47.890
So it all worked out.

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:53.320
We run our company on seven
foundation principles,

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:56.120
which I won't be able to go
into all in this little talk.

00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:00.999
But they're all available
online at our blog,

00:07:00.999 --> 00:07:01.790
whatwestandfor.com.

00:07:05.526 --> 00:07:07.320
And these seven
foundation principles

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:09.480
are identical to
the four tenants

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:10.970
of conscious capitalism.

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:13.960
And we've been operating
that way since 1978.

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:16.860
We just didn't know to call it
conscious capitalism back then.

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:20.460
And so they're
simple, almost corny,

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:24.860
"do unto others" type things
that everybody agrees on.

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:26.500
How many of you
don't really agree

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:28.130
with that "do unto
others" thing?

00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:29.970
You think that's a bad idea?

00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:32.360
So see, everybody agrees
with these simple things.

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:35.570
One of them is Andrew
Carnegie's statement.

00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:37.750
The great industrialist
Andrew Carnegie

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:41.320
was laying on his deathbed
and attributed all

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:44.660
his business success to the
one credo, the one guiding

00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:49.160
light that fill the other guy's
basket to the brim-- making

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:51.220
money then becomes
an easy proposition.

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:54.600
Fill the other guy's basket to
the brim-- making money then

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:55.920
becomes an easy proposition.

00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:57.500
That's the exact
opposite of what

00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:00.070
people are raised to believe,
that business is somehow

00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:03.530
a zero sum game, where someone
has to lose in order for you

00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:04.520
to win.

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:09.680
And so that one
foundation principle,

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:13.160
fill the other guy's
basket, has us creatively

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:16.590
crafting mutually beneficial
relationships with our vendors.

00:08:16.590 --> 00:08:20.270
And being able to
compete with the giant,

00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:22.130
mass merchant
retailers in America,

00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:25.450
because we can't beat them
on volume necessarily.

00:08:25.450 --> 00:08:27.200
But we can beat
them on relationship

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:31.380
synergistic win-win, fill the
other guy's basket relationship

00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:32.480
with these vendors.

00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:36.659
And you become your
vendor's favorite customer.

00:08:36.659 --> 00:08:40.370
And you don't have to beat
up your vendor to get ahead.

00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:45.460
It's far better to creatively
craft that mutually beneficial

00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:47.965
relationship, which is only
limited by your imagination

00:08:47.965 --> 00:08:50.340
and how much you can learn
about each other's businesses.

00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:53.050
And then you form this
synergistic relationship

00:08:53.050 --> 00:08:56.490
that is immensely more
profitable than just

00:08:56.490 --> 00:08:59.840
the old power struggle,
the tug and back and forth

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:02.420
of trying to sort of
beat up the vendor.

00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:05.030
And it's much more enjoyable.

00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:07.480
If you look at
the companies that

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:09.600
are dominating their
niches-- and Google

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:14.070
is a great example-- Southwest
Airlines, Whole Foods,

00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:18.800
Costco-- they're very
good at those synergistic

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:19.590
relationships.

00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:22.350
That's where actually
more money is made.

00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:24.860
Conscious capitalism
is not a sacrifice.

00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:27.440
Conscious capitalism actually
makes you more profitable than

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:29.330
if you were trying to
do it the other way.

00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:32.130
And that's why I think
that eventually, people

00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:34.330
like John Mackey,
the Whole Foods guy,

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:38.469
and I can quit trying
to spread the word

00:09:38.469 --> 00:09:40.260
about conscious
capitalism, because I think

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.176
a good capitalist is
going to eventually adopt

00:09:42.176 --> 00:09:43.950
that methodology which
is most successful.

00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:48.600
And it's kind of a movement.

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:50.720
And it's kind of beginning
to happen like that.

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:52.530
Skepticism is vanishing.

00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:54.110
Much to my delight
and surprise, when

00:09:54.110 --> 00:10:02.750
we did our IPO roadshow, the
largest institutional investors

00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:05.370
on Wall Street, all they
really wanted to talk about

00:10:05.370 --> 00:10:08.720
was conscious capitalism and
the quirky, yummy culture

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:09.915
of The Container Store.

00:10:09.915 --> 00:10:11.790
I thought when I tried
to talk about culture,

00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:14.600
they would roll their eyes
and get impatient and think

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:15.810
"Kumbaya" and all that.

00:10:15.810 --> 00:10:19.390
But I mean, skepticism
is vanishing on this.

00:10:19.390 --> 00:10:23.040
And it's fun to give a
presentation at Google

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:25.980
because Google is a
great example of it.

00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:29.440
So I encourage you to read
about the foundation principles.

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:30.940
They're simple.

00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:33.770
You can read about them on
the blog, what we stand for.

00:10:33.770 --> 00:10:36.540
And they were created
as a means to the end.

00:10:40.090 --> 00:10:42.090
We have 6,000 employees.

00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:44.170
We don't want to be
6,000 yahoos going

00:10:44.170 --> 00:10:46.690
in 6,000 different directions.

00:10:46.690 --> 00:10:50.360
So we agree on the ends, like
fill the other guy's basket

00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:51.100
to the brim.

00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:53.540
And then everybody's enabled
to choose their own means

00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:54.479
to the end.

00:10:54.479 --> 00:10:55.770
I don't think I'm smart enough.

00:10:55.770 --> 00:10:58.080
No one's smart enough
to tell that many people

00:10:58.080 --> 00:10:59.620
how to handle any
given situation.

00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:01.550
Because life's too situational.

00:11:01.550 --> 00:11:04.520
And certainly retail
is too situational.

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:07.350
So that unharnesses
everybody to use

00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:08.930
their own individual
creative genius

00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:10.731
to figure out how
to get to that end.

00:11:10.731 --> 00:11:13.230
And you'll hear things like,
well, why do we do it that way?

00:11:13.230 --> 00:11:17.172
Well, that's because of the
Andrew Carnegie thing, the fill

00:11:17.172 --> 00:11:18.630
the other guy's
basket to the brim.

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:21.580
And what's remarkable
about that,

00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:23.260
and it kind of
surprised me how true

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:26.520
it is, even though he never
told all these people how

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:30.530
to handle a particular
circumstance, just

00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:33.000
liberating everybody
to agree on these ends

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.580
and choose their own means
causes a circumstance that

00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:39.310
arises in the Miami store
to be handled miraculously,

00:11:39.310 --> 00:11:41.400
the same as it is in
the Seattle store.

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:43.920
People are people.

00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:47.934
They're using individual means,
but the ends are the same.

00:11:47.934 --> 00:11:48.850
Does that makes sense?

00:11:48.850 --> 00:11:51.680
I mean, it's just the old
means to the end thing.

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:53.690
I think it's oppressive
to try to tell people

00:11:53.690 --> 00:11:55.520
how to get to the end.

00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:57.980
Let them figure out--
let them be themselves.

00:11:57.980 --> 00:12:01.160
Let them be their own
beautiful, unique personalities.

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:03.790
And then just kind
of agree on the ends.

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:07.410
Conscious capitalism is
something I'm passionate about.

00:12:08.810 --> 00:12:11.110
Weirdly and oddly
enough, John Mackey,

00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:15.460
the quirky, wonderful founder
and CEO of Whole Foods and I

00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:18.650
were actually college roommates
at University of Texas.

00:12:18.650 --> 00:12:19.610
It's just bizarre.

00:12:19.610 --> 00:12:21.830
And then we both
went off and started

00:12:21.830 --> 00:12:24.815
these conscious capitalist
retail businesses.

00:12:27.726 --> 00:12:30.350
We saw each other a little bit,
but not that much after school.

00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:32.820
We were so busy
being entrepreneurs

00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:34.040
and growing our businesses.

00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:35.930
And after about 20
years, we got together

00:12:35.930 --> 00:12:40.380
for this really extensive,
almost all-day-long Time

00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:41.620
Magazine article.

00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:43.090
And we were rolling
on the floor,

00:12:43.090 --> 00:12:46.180
laughing hysterically at
how identical our business

00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:48.729
philosophies have become, even
though we hadn't-- I mean,

00:12:48.729 --> 00:12:50.520
that's not what we
talked about in college.

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:51.880
You know what we talked
about in college,

00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:53.338
and it wasn't
conscious capitalism.

00:12:53.890 --> 00:12:55.270
It was girls.

00:12:55.270 --> 00:12:57.090
It wasn't retail.

00:12:57.090 --> 00:13:02.220
And so many identical things
that we thought no one

00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:05.034
believed or no one thought
and it was just hysterical.

00:13:05.034 --> 00:13:07.450
And that article is still out
there on the internet-- Time

00:13:07.450 --> 00:13:10.030
Magazine with John
Mackey and Kip Tindell.

00:13:10.030 --> 00:13:12.250
The four tenets of conscious
capitalism-- number one,

00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:15.120
you have a higher
purpose as a business.

00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:18.150
You have a higher purpose
than just profit or just

00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:19.650
making money for your business.

00:13:19.650 --> 00:13:21.454
I don't know any
entrepreneurs-- I

00:13:21.454 --> 00:13:23.370
don't think I've ever
met an entrepreneur that

00:13:23.370 --> 00:13:25.100
said the reason they
did what they did

00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:27.410
was to make a lot of money.

00:13:27.410 --> 00:13:29.179
Doctors don't say
the reason I became

00:13:29.179 --> 00:13:30.970
a doctor was to make
a lot of money, right?

00:13:30.970 --> 00:13:36.680
I mean, it's you have a higher
purpose besides just profits.

00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:40.015
That's one of the four tenets
of conscious capitalism.

00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:42.156
The other is
conscious leadership.

00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:48.640
Conscious leadership-- I think
CEOs get too much credit.

00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:51.284
They're kind of in
this celebrity culture.

00:13:51.284 --> 00:13:52.950
I think they're a
little overglamorized.

00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:56.340
It's really the
people behind them,

00:13:56.340 --> 00:13:58.330
people around them,
the management team

00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:03.520
and the part-time
worker in the store that

00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:06.030
really makes the
business what it is.

00:14:06.030 --> 00:14:10.090
But with conscious capitalism,
that person who is in that top

00:14:10.090 --> 00:14:14.300
role and the top management
team needs to really genuinely

00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:17.360
believe, in their heart and
soul, in conscious capitalism,

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:20.120
or it cannot and will not
happen in that organization.

00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:22.390
Because there's too many
forces to push against it.

00:14:22.390 --> 00:14:26.070
It has to be OK to behave
like that thoroughly.

00:14:26.070 --> 00:14:29.920
And it really helps for
that individual leader

00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:35.920
to understand and embody
the whole servant leadership

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:39.360
aspect of leadership,
and not be particularly

00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:40.610
in it for themselves.

00:14:42.020 --> 00:14:43.900
What really helps is
if they're kind of

00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:46.810
pretty high on Maslow's
hierarchy of needs.

00:14:46.810 --> 00:14:50.570
It's hard to manage that way if
you're cold or hungry or lonely

00:14:50.570 --> 00:14:52.960
or still trying to prove
to your dead father

00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:54.471
that you're a great businessman.

00:14:54.471 --> 00:14:54.970
You know?

00:14:54.970 --> 00:14:57.220
I mean, deep-seated
insecurities get

00:14:57.220 --> 00:14:59.170
in the way of that
type of leadership.

00:14:59.170 --> 00:15:01.250
Servant leadership
is a key component

00:15:01.250 --> 00:15:02.350
of conscious capitalism.

00:15:02.350 --> 00:15:04.322
I think it sums it up very well.

00:15:04.322 --> 00:15:05.822
And one thing I've
learned is I used

00:15:05.822 --> 00:15:07.430
to just think we
needed the smartest

00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:12.420
person to take that
big, important job.

00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:14.710
And I love intelligence,
and you look for that.

00:15:14.710 --> 00:15:16.820
But the social IQ is
even more important

00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:19.720
than the intellectual IQ--
something I've really learned.

00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:25.120
And so having those
qualities, those understanding

00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:29.740
and being good at nurturing
and communication, social IQ,

00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:35.620
being calmly self-confident but
in a very servant leadership,

00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:37.800
giving way, so that
you're not-- you

00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:40.004
can't give if you're that needy.

00:15:40.004 --> 00:15:41.420
You can't be a
good leader and you

00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:43.120
can't do much for
the world around you

00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:46.040
if you don't have
anything to give.

00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:48.840
So that type of conscious
leadership's the second point

00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:51.950
that I think is so important
in conscious leadership.

00:15:51.950 --> 00:15:53.350
The other's a stakeholder model.

00:15:53.350 --> 00:15:55.250
And I love the
stakeholder model.

00:15:55.250 --> 00:16:01.570
And Ed Freeman at University
of Virginia Darden School

00:16:01.570 --> 00:16:03.900
of Business is credited
with having created

00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:06.220
the conscious capitalism
stakeholder model.

00:16:11.450 --> 00:16:16.029
You're optimizing the needs
of all the stakeholders

00:16:16.029 --> 00:16:16.695
of the business.

00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:29.240
Let's see-- Milton Friedman,
the famous economist, once said,

00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:30.866
the only reason a
corporation exists

00:16:30.866 --> 00:16:32.740
is to maximize the return
of the shareholder.

00:16:33.777 --> 00:16:35.360
And we're like, you
know what, Milton?

00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:37.193
I know you won a Nobel
Prize and everything.

00:16:37.193 --> 00:16:39.110
With all due respect,
at The Container Store,

00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:40.940
we actually put
the employee first.

00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:42.800
And if you take
better care-- I mean,

00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:46.100
if you really take better care
of the employee than anybody

00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:48.104
else, she's going
to really take care

00:16:48.104 --> 00:16:49.520
of the customer
than anybody else.

00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:51.927
And of those two people are
ecstatic-- let's face it,

00:16:51.927 --> 00:16:53.510
if your employees
are ecstatic, you're

00:16:53.510 --> 00:16:55.680
getting remarkable productivity.

00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:57.279
If your customers
are ecstatic, you're

00:16:57.279 --> 00:16:58.320
getting remarkable sales.

00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:00.270
So if those two
people are ecstatic,

00:17:00.270 --> 00:17:02.250
your shareholders are
going to be ecstatic too.

00:17:02.250 --> 00:17:04.349
So I'm not sure we
really refute or disagree

00:17:04.349 --> 00:17:07.119
with Milton Friedman on the end.

00:17:07.119 --> 00:17:09.240
We just have a different
means to the end.

00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:12.490
And it's more joyful
to do it that way.

00:17:12.490 --> 00:17:15.690
And if you myopically focus
only on the shareholder,

00:17:15.690 --> 00:17:18.985
the magic is lost and very
often the employees are unhappy

00:17:18.985 --> 00:17:21.109
and the customers are
unhappy and the shareholder's

00:17:21.109 --> 00:17:22.200
going to be unhappy too.

00:17:23.329 --> 00:17:28.630
So the stakeholder model allows
us to put they employee first

00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:32.330
and to never rest while we
try to see how much more we

00:17:32.330 --> 00:17:33.910
can do for that employee.

00:17:33.910 --> 00:17:36.537
And I can't wait for my
tour of Google headquarters

00:17:36.537 --> 00:17:37.245
here in a minute.

00:17:37.245 --> 00:17:39.040
I can see so much of that here.

00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:40.630
It's a joy to see.

00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:43.080
It really-- I mean,
of course, I love it.

00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:44.840
It's so great.

00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:47.490
And like Google, The
Container Store's

00:17:47.490 --> 00:17:50.520
been on the Fortune
100 Best Companies

00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:54.920
To Work For in America list for,
in our case, 15 straight years.

00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:57.160
We were number one
twice, number two twice.

00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:59.130
I think Google was
number one at least once.

00:17:59.130 --> 00:18:00.560
It's a never-ending game.

00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:02.935
You're constantly
trying to see what

00:18:02.935 --> 00:18:04.310
else you can do
for the employee.

00:18:05.590 --> 00:18:08.790
As a result, after 36 years
I think our employee morale

00:18:08.790 --> 00:18:10.930
is the highest it's
ever been right now.

00:18:12.786 --> 00:18:14.160
One of the reasons
we went public

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:16.490
was to get more stock in
the hands of employees.

00:18:16.490 --> 00:18:18.070
It's standard
operating procedure

00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:19.475
to do options when
you're public.

00:18:19.475 --> 00:18:21.100
When you're private,
you have to depend

00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:24.347
upon your private partners
believing enough and getting

00:18:24.347 --> 00:18:26.555
stock in the hands of
employees to dilute themselves.

00:18:27.822 --> 00:18:29.280
I've always believed
in doing that.

00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:31.180
My wife, Sharon, is
our chief merchant.

00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:35.990
And we were lucky enough to
get a bunch of stock in 1978

00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:38.760
in this company that turned
out to be kind of a fairy tale

00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:39.650
success story.

00:18:39.650 --> 00:18:43.580
And so we can dilute ourselves
in order to get people,

00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:47.930
like these two wonderful vice
presidents here, more stock.

00:18:47.930 --> 00:18:53.050
And I think the happiest, most
devoted employee in the world

00:18:53.050 --> 00:18:56.820
still does better if they
own some of the company.

00:18:56.820 --> 00:18:58.560
But if you're private,
you have to-- see,

00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:00.330
people don't understand
that it's better

00:19:00.330 --> 00:19:04.310
to own 50% of a dollar
than 100% of a nickel.

00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:09.520
And your beautiful
private investors usually

00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:11.920
have some lawyer or
spouse or accountant

00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:13.520
that really won't
let them do that.

00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:18.322
So that's one of the major
reasons we went public.

00:19:18.322 --> 00:19:19.780
Also in that
stakeholder model, you

00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:21.050
have the vendor stakeholder.

00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:26.082
You can't tell the difference
between a vendor and a employee

00:19:26.082 --> 00:19:27.040
at The Container Store.

00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:30.457
I love elevating
the relationships

00:19:30.457 --> 00:19:32.040
that we have with
these manufacturers.

00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:34.140
We really are--
somebody gets the lowest

00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:35.400
price in the country.

00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:39.660
Somebody gets the last
pallet of a very hot item

00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:40.990
that holiday season.

00:19:42.410 --> 00:19:44.430
We create products
with these vendors.

00:19:44.430 --> 00:19:45.690
This guy's the best at wire.

00:19:45.690 --> 00:19:47.230
This guy's the best at wood.

00:19:47.230 --> 00:19:50.720
OK, let's create the wood in
Estonia, where all the wood is.

00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:53.860
And the same people
for 5, 15, 25 years,

00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:57.770
you're creating products
that nobody else carries

00:19:57.770 --> 00:19:59.656
that's exclusive to
The Container Store.

00:19:59.656 --> 00:20:01.280
And these relationships
build, and they

00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:03.147
become your best friend.

00:20:03.147 --> 00:20:04.730
You travel the world
with them and you

00:20:04.730 --> 00:20:07.590
create product that is so fun.

00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:09.670
I mean, we get excited
about silly things.

00:20:09.670 --> 00:20:12.900
We get excited about having--
we just recently created

00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:16.100
the world's absolutely best
shoe boxes and sweater boxes.

00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:18.020
I mean, it was ecstasy to us.

00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:18.870
It was just fun.

00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:22.960
But you pick these people
that are the most talented,

00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:25.430
manufacturing certain
types of products.

00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:27.990
And then since The Container
Store has its finger

00:20:27.990 --> 00:20:30.080
closer to the pulse of
the consumer than most

00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:33.150
manufacturers, you can
create great product

00:20:33.150 --> 00:20:34.776
that the big mass
merchants don't have.

00:20:34.776 --> 00:20:37.275
You have no reason to exist if
you're selling the same thing

00:20:37.275 --> 00:20:38.040
everybody else is.

00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:41.140
And that's creatively
crafting a mutually beneficial

00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:42.812
relationship with the vendor.

00:20:42.812 --> 00:20:44.270
And then when you
do well, when you

00:20:44.270 --> 00:20:45.850
have very high
financial performance,

00:20:45.850 --> 00:20:47.766
you can do wonderful
things for the community.

00:20:48.490 --> 00:20:51.100
Communities go out of
their way to do anything

00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:52.640
they can with The
Container Store.

00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:55.630
This one wants our
headquarters in its town,

00:20:55.630 --> 00:20:59.140
because they really see us
as embodying family values,

00:20:59.140 --> 00:20:59.920
and they do that.

00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:03.680
So they make it impossible
for us to not locate that

00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:04.430
in that community.

00:21:04.430 --> 00:21:06.540
It's so nice when
the communities

00:21:06.540 --> 00:21:10.690
that you serve, with
open arms help you.

00:21:10.690 --> 00:21:14.750
And in fact, conscious
capitalism what it really does

00:21:14.750 --> 00:21:17.570
is it causes the universe
to conspire to assist you.

00:21:18.587 --> 00:21:20.670
And it's a lot easier to
be successful in business

00:21:20.670 --> 00:21:22.620
when the universe is
conspiring to assist you

00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:24.490
than it is if people are
laying awake at night trying

00:21:24.490 --> 00:21:26.290
to figure out how
to get back at you.

00:21:26.290 --> 00:21:31.380
And it makes life so pleasant
to be loved rather than hated.

00:21:33.330 --> 00:21:35.380
I think the universe
conspires to assist

00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:37.920
an individual or a company
when it behaves this way.

00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:43.180
The fourth tenet of
conscious capitalism

00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:44.370
is a conscious culture.

00:21:44.370 --> 00:21:47.500
The culture drives the
value of the business.

00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:50.190
I believe the culture
drives the value of Google.

00:21:50.190 --> 00:21:53.090
It certainly drives the
value of The Container Store.

00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:58.130
Much to my happiness,
I discovered

00:21:58.130 --> 00:22:02.740
that most of the institutional
investors on Wall Street

00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:05.527
accept the notion that
the culture drives

00:22:05.527 --> 00:22:06.610
the value of the business.

00:22:09.530 --> 00:22:13.240
Drucker said that
culture eats strategy

00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:15.350
for breakfast in the morning.

00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:16.295
And it's really true.

00:22:18.655 --> 00:22:21.030
And so those are the four
tenets of conscious capitalism.

00:22:21.030 --> 00:22:24.970
And they happen to be exactly
the same thing as our seven

00:22:24.970 --> 00:22:26.910
foundation principles,
which you're

00:22:26.910 --> 00:22:32.810
going to go onto
whatwestandfor.com to learn

00:22:32.810 --> 00:22:34.005
more about, I hope.

00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:37.800
So capitalism has a
public relations problem.

00:22:40.540 --> 00:22:41.240
It really does.

00:22:44.190 --> 00:22:45.630
I mean, I'm a capitalist.

00:22:45.630 --> 00:22:50.940
If you ask a bunch
of millennial people,

00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:53.300
or even a bunch of baby
boomers whether they

00:22:53.300 --> 00:22:56.515
want to be a capitalist,
most of them will say no.

00:22:56.515 --> 00:22:58.515
You ask them if they want
to be an entrepreneur,

00:22:58.515 --> 00:22:59.520
they'll all say yes.

00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:01.145
But they don't want
to be a capitalist.

00:23:02.950 --> 00:23:04.455
But capitalism is actually good.

00:23:08.572 --> 00:23:10.030
When I talk about
this, it makes me

00:23:10.030 --> 00:23:13.460
sound like some kind of a
libertarian or something.

00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:14.430
Mackey is, but I'm not.

00:23:14.430 --> 00:23:16.090
I'm kind of a moderate Democrat.

00:23:16.090 --> 00:23:19.916
But capitalism is the most
efficient system ever devised

00:23:19.916 --> 00:23:21.540
to move goods and
services and get them

00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:24.880
where they needed to be to
the betterment of humanity.

00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:25.870
Communism didn't work.

00:23:25.870 --> 00:23:28.020
200 million people died, right?

00:23:28.020 --> 00:23:30.420
Socialism isn't
working that well.

00:23:30.420 --> 00:23:33.300
200 years ago, a
little more than 85%

00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:36.380
of the world's population
lived on $1 a day.

00:23:36.380 --> 00:23:38.380
200 years ago, including
in this country--

00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:40.420
most people lived on $1 a day.

00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:44.550
Now only 16% of the
world lives on $1 a day.

00:23:44.550 --> 00:23:48.010
That type of abject
poverty is certainly

00:23:48.010 --> 00:23:49.420
moving in a good trend.

00:23:49.420 --> 00:23:54.370
And by the time-- the
age group in this room,

00:23:54.370 --> 00:23:59.410
by the time you're at the end of
the lifespan of your children,

00:23:59.410 --> 00:24:04.040
that number is thought to
be-- will be like 1/100 of 1%,

00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:07.575
it's really thought
will be that negligible.

00:24:10.882 --> 00:24:12.840
Bill Clinton is running
around the world giving

00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:15.250
a speech that's
roughly entitled,

00:24:15.250 --> 00:24:16.460
Charity Won't Save the World.

00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:17.070
Business Will.

00:24:17.070 --> 00:24:18.700
Business is so
much more powerful

00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:21.150
than all the nonprofits
and charities of the world

00:24:21.150 --> 00:24:23.660
that if we could harness
the good of business

00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:29.410
to make the world and the
planet better than it's been,

00:24:29.410 --> 00:24:31.160
not only would those
businesses do better,

00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:34.290
but the world would be quite
a bit better off as well.

00:24:34.290 --> 00:24:37.960
So that's really the power
of conscious capitalism.

00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:43.630
And if you look at-- John
Mackey and Raj Sisodia

00:24:43.630 --> 00:24:45.690
co-wrote the book
"Conscious Capitalism."

00:24:45.690 --> 00:24:46.230
Great book.

00:24:46.230 --> 00:24:47.700
You should read "Conscious
Capitalism" if you haven't.

00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:48.820
I bet some of you have.

00:24:51.570 --> 00:24:54.650
Raj is on our board at The
Container Store-- college

00:24:54.650 --> 00:24:58.250
professor, big rock star,
international college

00:24:58.250 --> 00:24:58.750
professor.

00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:01.890
He did an exhaustive
study that is so helpful

00:25:01.890 --> 00:25:04.820
to have of all the companies,
the public companies

00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:07.990
in America, that have--
including Google-- that

00:25:07.990 --> 00:25:10.930
have been public for
a good long while.

00:25:10.930 --> 00:25:14.350
And what he discovered is that
those companies outperformed

00:25:14.350 --> 00:25:18.720
the S&amp;P Index 14 to 1
over the last 15 years.

00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:19.819
I mean, 14 to 1.

00:25:19.819 --> 00:25:20.610
Are you kidding me?

00:25:20.610 --> 00:25:23.850
That's 1400-- it's not 20%
better or 80% percent better.

00:25:23.850 --> 00:25:25.170
It's 1,400% better.

00:25:25.170 --> 00:25:28.290
And for a long time, 15 years.

00:25:28.290 --> 00:25:30.910
And those companies like
Google and Whole Foods

00:25:30.910 --> 00:25:33.080
and Southwest Airlines--
The Container Store

00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:34.480
is not on the list yet.

00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:35.220
It's in the book.

00:25:35.220 --> 00:25:37.230
He's studied us
too, but we haven't

00:25:37.230 --> 00:25:39.574
been public for long enough
to be on that part of it.

00:25:39.574 --> 00:25:41.240
We've been public for
just under a year.

00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:46.787
So if all you really want
to do is make as much money

00:25:46.787 --> 00:25:48.620
as humanly possible,
as rapidly as possible,

00:25:48.620 --> 00:25:50.995
I would submit to you that
conscious capitalism's the way

00:25:50.995 --> 00:25:51.900
to do it.

00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:53.367
But further than
that, it enriches

00:25:53.367 --> 00:25:54.950
your lives and the
lives of the people

00:25:54.950 --> 00:25:59.500
you do business with hugely
while it's doing that.

00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:02.620
No wonder the universe conspires
to help companies like that.

00:26:02.620 --> 00:26:05.165
Everybody's proud of the
way they behave themselves.

00:26:05.165 --> 00:26:06.790
Everybody's proud of
the fact that they

00:26:06.790 --> 00:26:07.748
help their communities.

00:26:08.910 --> 00:26:12.890
If a company nurtures
its employees-- certainly

00:26:12.890 --> 00:26:16.680
seems to be going on here--
makes them feel valued,

00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:19.670
elevates their self-esteem
rather than tearing down

00:26:19.670 --> 00:26:22.580
their self-esteem,
pays them well,

00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:25.820
lets them be themselves at
work, rewards the creativity

00:26:25.820 --> 00:26:29.190
that comes from them
being themselves,

00:26:29.190 --> 00:26:33.230
spends money to train
and develop them,

00:26:33.230 --> 00:26:38.440
makes them thrive, that
employee goes home at night

00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:41.260
and he treats his family
differently-- better.

00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:43.420
Treats his golden
retriever better.

00:26:43.420 --> 00:26:45.442
Treats the guy at the
7-Eleven on the way home

00:26:45.442 --> 00:26:46.275
totally differently.

00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:52.510
Way up on Maslow--
he's is a fulfilled,

00:26:52.510 --> 00:26:55.470
generous but
self-confident human being

00:26:55.470 --> 00:26:56.975
that behaves differently.

00:26:58.360 --> 00:27:00.900
And when companies do that,
when organizations do that,

00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:02.900
they're just as attractive
and they're just

00:27:02.900 --> 00:27:07.290
as better able to help everyone
and everything around them.

00:27:07.290 --> 00:27:12.270
And so that's what the
foundation principles do.

00:27:12.270 --> 00:27:15.020
That's what conscious
capitalism does.

00:27:15.020 --> 00:27:18.230
That's when everybody's
thriving is when you sort of get

00:27:18.230 --> 00:27:20.520
that action, you get
that type of thing.

00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:24.240
I used to hate it
when it happened,

00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:27.490
but I have employees
say things like, kept

00:27:27.490 --> 00:27:31.110
working at The Container Store
has made me a better father.

00:27:31.110 --> 00:27:32.405
I'm like, oh, my God.

00:27:32.405 --> 00:27:33.030
Don't say that.

00:27:33.030 --> 00:27:33.930
It's embarrassing.

00:27:33.930 --> 00:27:35.610
I mean, like, really?

00:27:35.610 --> 00:27:37.540
Then they go into
telling me why.

00:27:37.540 --> 00:27:40.090
Or at company functions,
happens all the time, somebody

00:27:40.090 --> 00:27:44.950
will stand up and
say, my husband

00:27:44.950 --> 00:27:47.324
is a better father and
a better spouse because

00:27:47.324 --> 00:27:49.740
of the foundational principles
of working at The Container

00:27:49.740 --> 00:27:49.995
Store.

00:27:49.995 --> 00:27:52.110
And it's like, you never
get used to hearing that.

00:27:52.110 --> 00:27:54.350
And it is embarrassing,
but it is true.

00:27:54.350 --> 00:27:57.590
And so I think businesses
just to remember

00:27:57.590 --> 00:27:59.520
that every single
employee worldwide

00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:01.906
is somebody's
precious child that's

00:28:01.906 --> 00:28:03.530
been nurtured and
developed by parents.

00:28:03.530 --> 00:28:06.780
And now we have a lot of
control over their lives,

00:28:06.780 --> 00:28:10.700
because you spend most of
your waking hours working.

00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:13.160
And people-- it's
probably wrong,

00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:16.050
but we put too much of
our self-worth in what we

00:28:16.050 --> 00:28:17.077
do at work.

00:28:17.077 --> 00:28:18.660
Friends and family
are more important,

00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:23.120
but our self-esteem has a
great deal to do with work.

00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:27.330
So an oppressive workplace,
an oppressive employer

00:28:27.330 --> 00:28:30.120
is really bad for the human
spirit and human psyche.

00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:34.001
And a good one is
really, really good.

00:28:34.001 --> 00:28:36.500
Part of it is understanding the
essence of the human spirit.

00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:40.204
People don't want to come
to work and goof off and do

00:28:40.204 --> 00:28:41.120
as little as possible.

00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:43.495
They want to come to work and
do great things with people

00:28:43.495 --> 00:28:44.580
they admire and love.

00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:45.760
They love to work
with great people

00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:46.750
and then go home
at night, feeling

00:28:46.750 --> 00:28:48.830
wonderful about what
they've accomplished.

00:28:48.830 --> 00:28:54.580
And so a good boss recognizes
that and nurtures and develops

00:28:54.580 --> 00:28:55.080
that.

00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:58.620
A bad boss is
someone that thinks

00:28:58.620 --> 00:29:00.060
that people don't
want to do much.

00:29:00.060 --> 00:29:01.170
And then they
treat them that way

00:29:01.170 --> 00:29:02.795
and then you kind of
reap what you sow.

00:29:04.070 --> 00:29:05.690
Another important
thing is that people

00:29:05.690 --> 00:29:07.534
love to work with
people that are great.

00:29:07.534 --> 00:29:09.700
At The Container Store,
another foundation principle

00:29:09.700 --> 00:29:10.750
is one equals three.

00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:13.114
We only hire great people.

00:29:13.114 --> 00:29:14.530
I know Google does
the same thing.

00:29:15.572 --> 00:29:17.905
How delightful it is to be
able to work with people that

00:29:17.905 --> 00:29:19.738
are wonderful, that you
think are wonderful.

00:29:19.738 --> 00:29:22.682
In fact, I think it's one the
most important aspects of being

00:29:22.682 --> 00:29:25.870
a great place to
work, that you get

00:29:25.870 --> 00:29:27.409
to work-- if we
started a golf team

00:29:27.409 --> 00:29:29.200
and we had Phil Mickelson
on the golf team,

00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:31.459
don't you think we'd
feel better about being

00:29:31.459 --> 00:29:33.000
on that team than
if he wasn't there?

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:34.030
It's like, wow!

00:29:34.030 --> 00:29:34.955
It's really great.

00:29:38.387 --> 00:29:40.720
So that's something we really
pay a lot of attention to.

00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:41.690
One equals three.

00:29:41.690 --> 00:29:45.320
One great person can easily
do the business productivity

00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:47.230
of three good people.

00:29:47.230 --> 00:29:48.829
We don't have an HR department.

00:29:48.829 --> 00:29:50.245
Our head of
recruiting understands

00:29:50.245 --> 00:29:52.630
that it's her job to
make sure the rest of us

00:29:52.630 --> 00:29:55.670
bring all of our friends and
relatives in that are great.

00:29:55.670 --> 00:29:59.840
We don't have any rules against
family or relationships.

00:30:01.450 --> 00:30:03.460
Sharon and I are
married, so it's mayhem.

00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:04.549
People get married.

00:30:04.549 --> 00:30:05.590
They date, they whatever.

00:30:05.590 --> 00:30:06.750
That's fine.

00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:10.114
People bring in their relatives.

00:30:10.114 --> 00:30:12.530
I mean, you know which of your
cousins are great and which

00:30:12.530 --> 00:30:13.260
ones aren't.

00:30:14.710 --> 00:30:18.290
So I think that's how
you find great people,

00:30:18.290 --> 00:30:22.012
is finding people you
care about and you know.

00:30:22.012 --> 00:30:24.210
A pretty good
summation of what we

00:30:24.210 --> 00:30:27.840
do to try to make everybody
thrive, what I believe Google

00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:31.070
does, what conscious
capitalism companies do,

00:30:31.070 --> 00:30:32.160
is the wake thing.

00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:34.635
W-A-K-E, like a boat's wake.

00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:38.170
Your wake and my
wake-- your wake

00:30:38.170 --> 00:30:41.090
is so much bigger and more
powerful than you think it is.

00:30:41.090 --> 00:30:43.370
It's really an
interesting message.

00:30:43.370 --> 00:30:48.940
Everybody wildly underestimates
the power of their wake.

00:30:48.940 --> 00:30:52.780
And even the most arrogant
person you know wildly

00:30:52.780 --> 00:30:54.750
underestimates the
power of their wake.

00:30:54.750 --> 00:30:57.040
My favorite movie's
probably, corny

00:30:57.040 --> 00:30:59.530
as it is, "It's a
Wonderful Life."

00:30:59.530 --> 00:31:01.120
Because the whole
movie shows one guy,

00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:03.220
George Bailey, the
incredible power of his wake.

00:31:03.220 --> 00:31:06.700
And he believed that
his savings and loan

00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:09.605
had such an amazing
impact on Bedford Falls.

00:31:12.162 --> 00:31:12.870
You're like that.

00:31:12.870 --> 00:31:13.770
We're all like that.

00:31:13.770 --> 00:31:16.900
Isn't nice to know
that everything

00:31:16.900 --> 00:31:19.250
you do and everything
you do not do

00:31:19.250 --> 00:31:22.810
has such an impact on the people
around you and your business.

00:31:22.810 --> 00:31:27.640
So I think that a person
that's mindful of their wake

00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:30.200
behaves differently and
behaves a lot better.

00:31:32.090 --> 00:31:39.160
And other people find her to be
more honorable, easier to love,

00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:40.760
exciting to be around.

00:31:40.760 --> 00:31:44.120
An organization where everybody
is mindful of its wake

00:31:44.120 --> 00:31:45.060
is the same way.

00:31:49.670 --> 00:31:51.430
That's an unassailable
business advantage.

00:31:52.139 --> 00:31:53.680
People want to work
for that company.

00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:54.980
They want to shop.

00:31:54.980 --> 00:31:56.564
Consumers vote with
their pocketbook.

00:31:56.564 --> 00:31:58.230
You want to be a
vendor to that company.

00:31:58.230 --> 00:32:02.320
It's such an honor to
be a vendor of Google,

00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:03.600
or vendor of Container Store.

00:32:04.811 --> 00:32:06.560
If you're a vendor of
The Container Store,

00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:08.893
then everybody that wants to
do storage and organization

00:32:08.893 --> 00:32:09.394
sees that.

00:32:09.394 --> 00:32:11.726
Then they want your product,
because The Container Store

00:32:11.726 --> 00:32:12.620
leads that category.

00:32:14.250 --> 00:32:16.180
So the power of your
wake-- I think wake

00:32:16.180 --> 00:32:19.520
is a really good summation of
what conscious capitalism is

00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:23.400
all about, just being
mindful of the impact of what

00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:25.160
we do as an organization.

00:32:26.630 --> 00:32:30.380
So it's creating
a business where

00:32:30.380 --> 00:32:32.525
everyone associated
with it thrives.

00:32:33.770 --> 00:32:36.760
The stakeholder model
can go to-- I've

00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:38.140
talked to Ed Freeman about this.

00:32:38.140 --> 00:32:47.430
And it can be your employee's,
child's, school's, vendor's,

00:32:47.430 --> 00:32:52.210
that ripple effect can go out
so that the way that you deal

00:32:52.210 --> 00:32:55.437
with that stakeholder is
impacted way out there.

00:32:55.437 --> 00:32:56.770
It's really a beautiful thought.

00:32:56.770 --> 00:32:59.720
I mean, if you think
the power of your wake's

00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:01.580
is not just dramatically
more, just think

00:33:01.580 --> 00:33:04.430
about the ripple effect
of things like that.

00:33:04.430 --> 00:33:10.610
But conscious capitalism,
our foundation principles,

00:33:10.610 --> 00:33:16.230
creating a yummy, quirky
culture where everybody thrives

00:33:16.230 --> 00:33:17.880
and everybody can be themselves.

00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:20.550
People join the company
and they never leave.

00:33:20.550 --> 00:33:22.440
We have turnover
of less than 10%

00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:27.940
in a retail industry that has an
average turnover of over 100%.

00:33:29.439 --> 00:33:31.730
Even though we have one
ex-employee that just joined us

00:33:31.730 --> 00:33:33.130
here that used to work
for The Container Store

00:33:33.130 --> 00:33:34.400
now works for Google.

00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:35.810
But we still love her.

00:33:35.810 --> 00:33:36.867
She's great.

00:33:36.867 --> 00:33:38.575
She's part of that
single digit turnover.

00:33:40.700 --> 00:33:43.570
But I love retail.

00:33:43.570 --> 00:33:44.770
I love The Container Store.

00:33:44.770 --> 00:33:46.770
We're so nuts that my
wife and I are still

00:33:46.770 --> 00:33:50.610
working 70 or 80 hours a
week after 36 years of it.

00:33:50.610 --> 00:33:51.860
But we're doing what we love.

00:33:51.860 --> 00:33:54.360
I really do believe that
the true artist of life

00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:56.990
blurs the distinction
between work and play.

00:33:56.990 --> 00:33:58.140
Vendors become friends.

00:33:59.910 --> 00:34:02.710
Creating a new product is
more fun than playing golf.

00:34:05.825 --> 00:34:07.740
You're like Monet
painting the water lilies.

00:34:07.740 --> 00:34:09.114
You're doing what
you want to do.

00:34:09.114 --> 00:34:11.120
And I think that's when
you can do great things

00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:15.670
and leave the world a better
place than you found it

00:34:15.670 --> 00:34:17.550
and have an impact
on your employees

00:34:17.550 --> 00:34:19.790
and your stakeholders' lives.

00:34:19.790 --> 00:34:23.179
And it's really fun just
sharing some of these thoughts

00:34:23.179 --> 00:34:24.584
with you here at Google.

00:34:24.584 --> 00:34:26.500
I'm getting ready to get
a tour of your campus

00:34:26.500 --> 00:34:27.860
now, which I can't wait for.

00:34:29.634 --> 00:34:31.072
And I thank you for being here.

00:34:31.072 --> 00:34:32.530
We have a few
minutes for questions

00:34:32.530 --> 00:34:33.779
if anybody has some questions.

00:34:35.460 --> 00:34:41.040
So the question is, how do
you deal with it when you're

00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:44.230
in a business environment, in a
work culture where you believe

00:34:44.230 --> 00:34:47.710
in the concepts of conscious
capitalism or whatnot,

00:34:47.710 --> 00:34:49.880
but the people you're
working with do not.

00:34:49.880 --> 00:34:52.199
They look at you like you're
from a different planet

00:34:52.199 --> 00:34:54.409
because they really don't
believe in the stuff.

00:34:54.409 --> 00:34:55.659
First of all, that's changing.

00:34:55.659 --> 00:34:58.070
That's becoming less
and less frequent,

00:34:58.070 --> 00:34:59.830
but it's certainly
still out there.

00:34:59.830 --> 00:35:04.490
And I think sticking
to your principles

00:35:04.490 --> 00:35:07.222
in the face of all that
is still important, sort

00:35:07.222 --> 00:35:08.430
of almost leading by example.

00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:13.590
We've had a lot of influence on
getting all the best business

00:35:13.590 --> 00:35:17.290
schools in the country to begin
teaching conscious capitalism.

00:35:17.290 --> 00:35:20.027
And I think it's important
for people, when they get out

00:35:20.027 --> 00:35:22.360
of their MBA program, to
understand that business is not

00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:23.600
a zero sum game.

00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:27.100
It's not a zero sum game, and
that's beginning to change.

00:35:27.100 --> 00:35:28.851
It's not glacial.

00:35:28.851 --> 00:35:30.100
It's happening pretty quickly.

00:35:30.100 --> 00:35:32.920
The skepticism that I see
about conscious capitalism

00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:36.940
is a small fraction of what
it was even five years ago.

00:35:36.940 --> 00:35:41.620
And these models, like Google
and The Container Store

00:35:41.620 --> 00:35:44.550
are helping to persuade people.

00:35:44.550 --> 00:35:47.650
It's very different-- it's
very difficult if you're

00:35:47.650 --> 00:35:50.240
working at a company
that just refuses

00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:52.120
to understand it or believe it.

00:35:53.190 --> 00:35:55.230
It's easier if you're
leading that company.

00:35:55.230 --> 00:35:57.060
Then you can do
something about it.

00:35:57.060 --> 00:36:02.216
And I would tend to
say maybe that culture

00:36:02.216 --> 00:36:03.590
wasn't the right
culture for you.

00:36:03.590 --> 00:36:05.048
Maybe you could
find a company that

00:36:05.048 --> 00:36:09.180
behaved a little more that
way and you might flourish

00:36:09.180 --> 00:36:10.760
and be happier in that culture.

00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:14.790
Or, you can doggedly try to
turn it around from within.

00:36:14.790 --> 00:36:17.770
I think that's the--
leaving the world better

00:36:17.770 --> 00:36:19.870
place than you found it,
you just might succeed.

00:36:19.870 --> 00:36:21.710
I've seen that
happen a few times.

00:36:22.870 --> 00:36:25.120
And really working on the
leadership of the business

00:36:25.120 --> 00:36:27.950
to change their
values and attitudes

00:36:27.950 --> 00:36:29.260
is what's most important.

00:36:29.260 --> 00:36:35.440
I think there are some
really good stories about how

00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:37.170
store managers
were always asking

00:36:37.170 --> 00:36:40.510
what their most important
responsibility was.

00:36:40.510 --> 00:36:41.520
And it wasn't sales.

00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:44.130
It wasn't one equals
three great people.

00:36:44.130 --> 00:36:46.330
It was managing the values
and attitudes of people

00:36:46.330 --> 00:36:49.640
that they lead.

00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:53.630
And I think you do that to a
great extent as a co-worker

00:36:53.630 --> 00:36:54.130
too.

00:36:55.695 --> 00:36:57.820
It's really fun to work
with people that you admire

00:36:57.820 --> 00:36:58.623
and who are great.

00:37:00.690 --> 00:37:03.235
You can do so much more, as
we were talking about earlier.

00:37:03.235 --> 00:37:04.860
So I hope that answers
it a little bit.

00:37:04.860 --> 00:37:06.650
It's a tough question.

00:37:06.650 --> 00:37:08.430
But we're succeeding
in getting it taught.

00:37:08.430 --> 00:37:11.010
We're succeeding in
getting countless business

00:37:11.010 --> 00:37:13.590
organizations,
entrepreneurs to start out

00:37:13.590 --> 00:37:15.750
building businesses that way.

00:37:15.750 --> 00:37:17.990
When you start a business,
you get to kind of model

00:37:17.990 --> 00:37:19.740
the culture around
your own belief system.

00:37:20.820 --> 00:37:22.050
It's a ridiculous privilege.

00:37:22.050 --> 00:37:24.500
What a joy and what a
responsibility and what

00:37:24.500 --> 00:37:25.040
a privilege.

00:37:26.100 --> 00:37:29.485
When you manage somebody, you
have this huge responsibility

00:37:29.485 --> 00:37:34.077
to where you have a lot
of impact on their lives.

00:37:34.077 --> 00:37:35.160
And so then you can do it.

00:37:36.640 --> 00:37:40.580
As a worker, as a
coworker, you're

00:37:40.580 --> 00:37:42.430
not quite as powerful for that.

00:37:42.430 --> 00:37:46.090
But I like to thank you can have
some influence, some growing

00:37:46.090 --> 00:37:46.590
influence.

00:37:46.590 --> 00:37:49.470
Patience is probably important.

00:37:49.470 --> 00:37:51.430
But I can see you doing that.

00:37:53.332 --> 00:37:55.040
Any other questions,
or another question?

00:37:56.840 --> 00:37:57.444
Yeah?

00:37:57.444 --> 00:37:59.814
AUDIENCE: When you started
the company, your store,

00:37:59.814 --> 00:38:03.132
did you-- obviously the
idea of conscious capitalism

00:38:03.132 --> 00:38:05.740
is something you
established from day one.

00:38:05.740 --> 00:38:08.326
But did you start with
knowing that you wanted

00:38:08.326 --> 00:38:10.590
to start a company that
had that kind of culture,

00:38:10.590 --> 00:38:14.470
or did you start with the
idea [INAUDIBLE] same time?

00:38:15.925 --> 00:38:18.890
KIP TINDELL: I was always
really interested in philosophy.

00:38:18.890 --> 00:38:20.690
I wanted to major in
philosophy in school

00:38:20.690 --> 00:38:22.750
and my dad said no, you
can't major in philosophy

00:38:22.750 --> 00:38:24.215
or you'll have to
pay your own way.

00:38:24.215 --> 00:38:26.590
So I majored in English, which
is exactly the same thing.

00:38:27.810 --> 00:38:30.400
And the Whole Foods
guy, John Mackey,

00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:31.990
did major in philosophy.

00:38:31.990 --> 00:38:38.730
And we did talk a lot
about that-- idealistic 19-

00:38:38.730 --> 00:38:41.440
or 21-year-olds talking about
Kierkegaard and Nietzsche

00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:42.815
and all of that--
it was a blast.

00:38:44.860 --> 00:38:47.190
What we do has absolutely
nothing to do with religion,

00:38:47.190 --> 00:38:50.030
but I did go to Jesuit
High School in Dallas.

00:38:50.030 --> 00:38:51.540
And we had a lot
of young priests

00:38:51.540 --> 00:38:55.140
at the time that were extremely
into existential philosophy.

00:38:55.140 --> 00:38:56.640
And they taught me a lot.

00:38:56.640 --> 00:39:00.890
And I read everything
and I kept a little file

00:39:00.890 --> 00:39:04.240
of all the greatest thoughts
I had ever heard of or been

00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:07.750
taught or read or even
thought of myself.

00:39:07.750 --> 00:39:12.040
And 10 years into the business,
we opened a store in Houston

00:39:12.040 --> 00:39:13.790
at the corner of Post,
Oak and Westheimer.

00:39:14.940 --> 00:39:19.527
And we were doing three or four
times what we expected to do.

00:39:19.527 --> 00:39:20.110
It was mayhem.

00:39:20.110 --> 00:39:22.070
We just couldn't
keep up with it.

00:39:22.070 --> 00:39:23.925
And people we were
hiring weren't right.

00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:27.520
The store scared me.

00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:31.500
It wasn't our-- so we had a
big meeting with all the staff

00:39:31.500 --> 00:39:33.040
at the store manager's house.

00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:34.498
And I was trying
to figure out what

00:39:34.498 --> 00:39:38.470
to do to teach them who we
were, what we stood for.

00:39:38.470 --> 00:39:40.303
See, before that you
could take somebody out

00:39:40.303 --> 00:39:41.900
to have Mexican food and
a couple of margaritas

00:39:41.900 --> 00:39:43.590
and explain everything
to them in one evening.

00:39:43.590 --> 00:39:45.620
And now it had to be
something more formalized.

00:39:45.620 --> 00:39:47.270
We were getting
too big for that.

00:39:47.270 --> 00:39:50.370
And I reached into that
file I was describing

00:39:50.370 --> 00:39:55.590
and brought out the seven
foundation principles-- or six,

00:39:55.590 --> 00:39:57.240
we've added one since then.

00:39:57.240 --> 00:39:59.970
And the one we've added is
communication is leadership.

00:39:59.970 --> 00:40:01.970
Leadership and communication
are the same thing,

00:40:01.970 --> 00:40:04.020
which is a wonderful,
wonderful thought.

00:40:04.020 --> 00:40:05.830
That's what leadership is.

00:40:05.830 --> 00:40:07.970
Communication can pretty
well solve anything.

00:40:07.970 --> 00:40:09.595
own And so leadership
and communication

00:40:09.595 --> 00:40:10.920
are the same thing.

00:40:10.920 --> 00:40:11.770
And they went crazy.

00:40:11.770 --> 00:40:12.400
They loved it.

00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:14.191
I was so afraid to tell
them, because these

00:40:14.191 --> 00:40:18.260
were my most personally
held philosophies.

00:40:18.260 --> 00:40:20.760
And I think your life
philosophy should

00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:22.200
be your business philosophy.

00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:24.840
See, people think that you
can have a different code

00:40:24.840 --> 00:40:26.880
of conduct in business
than you can personal.

00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:27.796
And that's ridiculous.

00:40:28.169 --> 00:40:30.710
So what do you gotta do, treat
all the people you do business

00:40:30.710 --> 00:40:33.235
with worse than the people--
well, you have to understand,

00:40:33.235 --> 00:40:34.110
it's just businesses.

00:40:34.110 --> 00:40:35.776
Like, no I don't
understand that at all.

00:40:35.776 --> 00:40:42.264
I mean, you can't-- so we were
very mindful of all this from

00:40:42.264 --> 00:40:43.055
the very beginning.

00:40:45.850 --> 00:40:48.890
We talked about it a lot.

00:40:48.890 --> 00:40:53.700
It's just who we
were and what we are

00:40:53.700 --> 00:40:56.460
and then that's how
it became formalized.

00:40:56.460 --> 00:40:58.350
And now, it is so
hard to believe

00:40:58.350 --> 00:41:00.350
that people are teaching
it in business schools.

00:41:00.350 --> 00:41:02.815
We have employees that
say, my favorite course

00:41:02.815 --> 00:41:04.660
in my MBA program
was the semester

00:41:04.660 --> 00:41:07.010
we spent on The Container
Store's business philosophies.

00:41:07.010 --> 00:41:08.420
And I'm like, what?

00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:15.550
That's what that book
is, "Uncontainable."

00:41:15.550 --> 00:41:17.910
"Uncontainable: How Passion,
Commitment and Conscious

00:41:17.910 --> 00:41:20.270
Capitalism Built a Business
Where Everyone Thrives."

00:41:20.270 --> 00:41:23.070
So the employees of
The Container Store

00:41:23.070 --> 00:41:24.610
have been wanting
this book to be

00:41:24.610 --> 00:41:26.120
written for many, many years.

00:41:26.120 --> 00:41:28.541
They're proud of our
business philosophies.

00:41:28.541 --> 00:41:30.540
And I was like, oh, we
don't have time for that.

00:41:30.540 --> 00:41:32.860
We have to create
more sweater boxes.

00:41:32.860 --> 00:41:35.680
We have to get that store
opened in Salt Lake.

00:41:35.680 --> 00:41:40.310
We're opening a new store
in Salt Lake Saturday.

00:41:40.310 --> 00:41:42.680
And that will be number 68.

00:41:44.510 --> 00:41:48.214
But Casey Shilling,
our vice president

00:41:48.214 --> 00:41:50.380
of public relations and I
have been working together

00:41:50.380 --> 00:41:51.390
for 17 years.

00:41:51.390 --> 00:41:52.430
And she was a huge help.

00:41:52.430 --> 00:41:54.180
The book would never
happened without her.

00:41:54.180 --> 00:41:57.790
Another guy, Paul Keegan,
helped me write it.

00:41:58.845 --> 00:42:00.720
So I was standing on
the shoulders of giants.

00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:04.250
I had two people forcing me
to write it, to find the time.

00:42:04.250 --> 00:42:05.425
And we did it together.

00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:08.450
So it's only been
out about a week.

00:42:08.450 --> 00:42:11.350
The reviews have been
embarrassingly fabulous.

00:42:13.270 --> 00:42:15.770
And I'm getting all
kinds of emails and calls

00:42:15.770 --> 00:42:19.090
from people that have-- it's
weird when you write a book.

00:42:19.090 --> 00:42:21.080
People that you love and
people that you admire

00:42:21.080 --> 00:42:23.140
have read your book and they
know all this personal stuff

00:42:23.140 --> 00:42:23.639
about you.

00:42:23.639 --> 00:42:26.010
So you have these
remarkable conversations.

00:42:26.010 --> 00:42:29.920
And it's a lot of fun.

00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:31.310
Yes, sir?

00:42:31.310 --> 00:42:32.160
So two questions.

00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:33.940
I mean, given the
business climate,

00:42:33.940 --> 00:42:36.680
would do create a business
like The Container Store

00:42:36.680 --> 00:42:37.195
again today?

00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:40.742
Yes, and I'll go into why.

00:42:40.742 --> 00:42:42.200
And the first
question was, I guess

00:42:42.200 --> 00:42:44.200
I can only remember
one question at a time.

00:42:44.200 --> 00:42:46.610
AUDIENCE: How do you
solve capitalism's--

00:42:46.610 --> 00:42:49.920
KIP TINDELL: How do we solve
capitalism's public relations

00:42:49.920 --> 00:42:51.320
problem?

00:42:51.320 --> 00:42:54.800
Well, I mean you're doing it
every day at Google-- Southwest

00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:56.054
Airlines.

00:42:56.054 --> 00:42:57.720
Herb Kelleher is kind
of a hero of mine.

00:42:57.720 --> 00:42:59.930
He's a Southwest
Airlines founder.

00:42:59.930 --> 00:43:02.780
And he told me 30
or 35 years ago,

00:43:02.780 --> 00:43:04.605
you can build a
better organization.

00:43:04.605 --> 00:43:08.520
You can build a better
business organization on love

00:43:08.520 --> 00:43:09.950
than you can fear.

00:43:09.950 --> 00:43:12.162
And I thought, wow,
who is this guy?

00:43:12.162 --> 00:43:13.370
He's the smart guy in Dallas.

00:43:13.370 --> 00:43:14.780
He's just awesome.

00:43:14.780 --> 00:43:18.120
And so John Mackey, the
Whole Foods guy, and I

00:43:18.120 --> 00:43:20.390
talk a lot about
love and business,

00:43:20.390 --> 00:43:23.570
about coworkers having
each other's backs

00:43:23.570 --> 00:43:25.320
and truly loving the workplace.

00:43:29.735 --> 00:43:30.910
And no fear.

00:43:30.910 --> 00:43:32.990
And companies like
that, I think,

00:43:32.990 --> 00:43:39.470
are building the case for
conscious capitalism every day.

00:43:39.470 --> 00:43:43.680
And so I think we're making
a lot of progress on that

00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:49.660
and that pretty soon most of the
most talented capitalists will

00:43:49.660 --> 00:43:52.440
be able to perceive that
companies they behave like that

00:43:52.440 --> 00:43:54.630
make a lot more money
than the ones that don't.

00:43:54.630 --> 00:43:56.980
And they have more
joyful stakeholders.

00:43:56.980 --> 00:44:00.550
And so it is already becoming
so much more prevalent

00:44:00.550 --> 00:44:03.265
than it was five or
eight years ago when

00:44:03.265 --> 00:44:06.290
we had these weird little
gatherings outside of Austin,

00:44:06.290 --> 00:44:10.230
Texas and started talking about
these strange concepts called

00:44:10.230 --> 00:44:11.760
conscious capitalism.

00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:16.390
Now you have the Unilever
CEO and these giant business

00:44:16.390 --> 00:44:19.000
executives carrying
on about the stuff.

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:21.447
And I think we're
definitely making progress.

00:44:21.447 --> 00:44:22.780
Now I forgot the other question.

00:44:22.780 --> 00:44:23.330
What was it?

00:44:23.330 --> 00:44:24.954
AUDIENCE: Given the business--

00:44:24.954 --> 00:44:27.390
KIP TINDELL: Yeah, I
think we'd do it again.

00:44:27.390 --> 00:44:31.150
You don't have a chance
with a retail business,

00:44:31.150 --> 00:44:37.300
as mass merchant as the
economy is, you would think.

00:44:37.300 --> 00:44:41.770
But when you do it this way,
when you create a business

00:44:41.770 --> 00:44:46.070
relationship with your
vendor that is your vendor's

00:44:46.070 --> 00:44:49.542
favorite business relationship,
and they want to see you win

00:44:49.542 --> 00:44:51.660
and they're doing
everything they

00:44:51.660 --> 00:44:55.000
can to creatively craft a
synergistic relationship

00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:57.190
with you so that you do
better and they do better.

00:44:57.190 --> 00:45:00.565
And that's when you start
having a chance against all

00:45:00.565 --> 00:45:02.930
the incredible competition,
because most people aren't

00:45:02.930 --> 00:45:03.570
doing that.

00:45:03.570 --> 00:45:05.590
I don't know what happens once
everybody starts doing that.

00:45:05.590 --> 00:45:08.006
Then the little guy would have
a hard time again, I guess.

00:45:08.006 --> 00:45:10.530
But in the meantime, this
is a really great way

00:45:10.530 --> 00:45:12.790
for smaller entrepreneurs
to do really

00:45:12.790 --> 00:45:20.520
well so that it's not just the
giant mass merchants dominating

00:45:20.520 --> 00:45:21.550
everything.

00:45:21.550 --> 00:45:25.310
And talent's the whole ballgame.

00:45:28.310 --> 00:45:33.340
We try so hard to hire only the
very, very, very best people

00:45:33.340 --> 00:45:34.520
at whatever endeavor.

00:45:34.520 --> 00:45:37.010
Because life's too short not
to do things with excellence.

00:45:37.010 --> 00:45:39.890
And it's so thrilling to
do things with excellence.

00:45:39.890 --> 00:45:42.550
And then that kind
of self-monitors.

00:45:43.910 --> 00:45:47.270
If somebody's kind of floating
along and not really applying

00:45:47.270 --> 00:45:49.130
themselves, they're
very unpopular

00:45:49.130 --> 00:45:50.790
and they leave after a while.

00:45:50.790 --> 00:45:52.910
So I think we could do it again.

00:45:52.910 --> 00:45:55.340
It was daunting in 1978.

00:45:55.340 --> 00:45:57.400
You couldn't go start
one little retail store

00:45:57.400 --> 00:46:00.630
and expect to be able to make
it, much less have everything

00:46:00.630 --> 00:46:02.220
evolve how it is.

00:46:02.220 --> 00:46:04.700
I mean, I would do that,
because I love retail.

00:46:04.700 --> 00:46:07.930
I think it's-- with all the
creativity and all the people

00:46:07.930 --> 00:46:10.520
orientation, I think it's the
best profession in the world.

00:46:10.520 --> 00:46:13.280
I'm getting ready to be the
chairman of the National Retail

00:46:13.280 --> 00:46:16.250
Federation January
1 for two years.

00:46:16.250 --> 00:46:18.230
And I'm really looking
forward to that

00:46:18.230 --> 00:46:21.760
as the spokesperson for one
in four American workers.

00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:25.170
Retail employees, one in
four of America's workers.

00:46:25.170 --> 00:46:27.065
So, a big responsibility
and something I'm

00:46:27.065 --> 00:46:28.560
really looking forward to.

00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:30.260
And I just like being
an entrepreneur.

00:46:30.260 --> 00:46:31.760
I couldn't wait to
get out of school

00:46:31.760 --> 00:46:33.790
so I could start something.

00:46:35.370 --> 00:46:37.620
What would I do if it hadn't
been The Container Store?

00:46:39.029 --> 00:46:40.820
I always say, I'd
probably be a fly fishing

00:46:40.820 --> 00:46:42.010
guide somewhere in Colorado.

00:46:42.010 --> 00:46:44.100
But I don't think so.

00:46:45.276 --> 00:46:47.670
Like I say, creating the
world's most perfect sweater box

00:46:47.670 --> 00:46:50.534
is a lot more fun than fly
fishing or playing golf.

00:46:50.534 --> 00:46:52.200
Although you need to
fly fish sometimes.

00:46:52.200 --> 00:46:55.629
And I actually get some of
my best ideas fly fishing.

00:46:55.629 --> 00:46:57.420
Because the only thing
you're worried about

00:46:57.420 --> 00:46:59.570
is what fly that trout wants.

00:46:59.570 --> 00:47:01.810
So it's not an
earth-shaking problem.

00:47:01.810 --> 00:47:06.370
It frees up your mind to
think about a lot of things.

00:47:08.070 --> 00:47:12.700
My old original
partner, Garrett Boone,

00:47:12.700 --> 00:47:15.170
this lady who used to work
with us said we probably

00:47:15.170 --> 00:47:16.030
would have gone into furniture.

00:47:16.030 --> 00:47:17.113
And I think he would have.

00:47:19.410 --> 00:47:21.150
What's ironic is
that I probably would

00:47:21.150 --> 00:47:24.717
have gone into some type
of gourmet food thing.

00:47:24.717 --> 00:47:25.425
I'm a big foodie.

00:47:27.250 --> 00:47:31.190
I was taking courses
at the LBJ School

00:47:31.190 --> 00:47:32.915
of Public Affairs
in Austin-- a lot

00:47:32.915 --> 00:47:34.360
of grocery stores and stuff.

00:47:35.420 --> 00:47:36.480
I was interested in that.

00:47:36.480 --> 00:47:38.630
And then it was kind of
funny that John Mackey

00:47:38.630 --> 00:47:40.070
went off and did that.

00:47:40.070 --> 00:47:45.710
But he actually met a girl
that was really big into that.

00:47:45.710 --> 00:47:47.300
That's what converted him.

00:47:50.032 --> 00:47:51.490
I never did the
food thing, but I'm

00:47:51.490 --> 00:47:53.881
so proud that there's grocery
stores like that in America

00:47:53.881 --> 00:47:54.380
now.

00:47:55.540 --> 00:47:59.670
Grocery stores in Texas of
that-- New York's always

00:47:59.670 --> 00:48:01.120
had a few.

00:48:01.120 --> 00:48:01.880
France has them.

00:48:01.880 --> 00:48:05.694
But I mean, you get a grocery
store like that in Iowa.

00:48:05.694 --> 00:48:06.860
That's quite a contribution.

00:48:06.860 --> 00:48:12.120
Plus I think it's probably
increased the life expectancy

00:48:12.120 --> 00:48:14.330
of the average American
by five or seven years,

00:48:14.330 --> 00:48:17.834
because even someone who's
never set foot in a Whole Foods,

00:48:17.834 --> 00:48:20.000
Whole Foods has changed
what the mass merchants sell

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:22.380
in their grocery stores, to
the benefit of everybody.

00:48:25.572 --> 00:48:26.530
That's a neat question.

00:48:26.530 --> 00:48:30.180
But I do like the
entrepreneur thing.

00:48:30.180 --> 00:48:33.330
And I do try to encourage
people to go off and do that.

00:48:33.330 --> 00:48:35.900
What's important is that
you do it right away,

00:48:35.900 --> 00:48:38.630
as soon as you get out of
school, as you get your MBA

00:48:38.630 --> 00:48:39.580
or whatever.

00:48:39.580 --> 00:48:42.550
Because once you are
making-- particularly

00:48:42.550 --> 00:48:44.590
if you're lucky enough
to, at a young age,

00:48:44.590 --> 00:48:47.402
make something like
$150,000 or $200,000 a year

00:48:47.402 --> 00:48:49.360
and then you get married
and you have two kids,

00:48:49.360 --> 00:48:51.550
you are not going to
go start something.

00:48:51.550 --> 00:48:53.130
You have to do it
when you're poor,

00:48:53.130 --> 00:48:55.130
when you first get out
of school or whatever.

00:48:55.130 --> 00:48:57.547
That's when you have the
best chance of doing it.

00:48:59.010 --> 00:49:00.550
I thank you all for being here.

00:49:00.550 --> 00:49:03.940
I hope you'll read the
book "Uncontainable."

00:49:03.940 --> 00:49:07.370
We're really proud
of it and delighted

00:49:07.370 --> 00:49:10.550
that it's off to a great start.

00:49:12.070 --> 00:49:14.820
Hope you'll go online and read
about the foundation principles

00:49:14.820 --> 00:49:16.070
and thank you for having me.

00:49:16.070 --> 00:49:16.570
Thanks.

00:49:16.570 --> 00:49:19.720
