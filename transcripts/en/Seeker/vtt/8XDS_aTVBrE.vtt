00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:05.420
KIC 8462852 probably sounds like a string
of random letters and numbers to you but I’m

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:09.690
willing to bet if you’ve watched this channel
long enough, you’ve heard it before.

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.090
It’s the name of a star, also known as Tabby’s
Star, and it set the internet ablaze a couple

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:18.830
years back when it dimmed in ways nobody could
really explain, unless you pinned it on aliens

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:21.520
building massive structures to power their
civilization.

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:26.180
Since then though we haven’t seen the star’s
light fade, and so public interest in it did.

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:30.700
But in April of 2017 light levels started
dropping again, giving astronomers new clues

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.410
to come up with new ideas.

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:36.110
Are any more compelling than a giant energy-harvesting
megastructure built by aliens?

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:37.840
I’ll let you be the judge of that.

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.989
First, a refresher on why Tabby’s star is
so mysterious.

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:46.610
In 2011 the Kepler Space Telescope observed
its light dimmed briefly by 15 percent.

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:51.200
Almost two years later, it temporarily dimmed
again, this time by about 22 percent.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.740
Often a drop in a star’s light levels is
a sign that a planet is passing in front of

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:55.740
it.

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:59.700
But even a planet the size of Jupiter would
only block about 1% of the light coming from

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:00.930
a star like this.

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.789
And the dimmings caused by planetary transits
should be symmetrical and at regular periods,

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:06.950
but these aren’t.

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.780
They’re erratic and all over the place,
and can last anywhere from 5 to 80 days.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.359
What we have on our hands gang, is a mystery.

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:18.759
An early explanation from 2015 was comets
were knocked from their orbit by a nearby

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:23.749
star and as they plummeted towards Tabby’s
star, they collided and created a debris cloud.

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:27.990
At the time it was the best fitting solution
that didn’t involve a vogon constructor

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.990
fleet.

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.740
Since that idea was first put forward, astronomers
have taken a look at data going all the way

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.099
back to the 90’s --the 1890’s that is--
and it turns out the star isn’t as bright

00:01:37.099 --> 00:01:38.400
as it used to be.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.609
As you’d expect from a star this uncooperative,
it’s faded erratically, but overall it’s

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:45.079
dimmed 16% in the last century.

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:49.149
Comets can’t really explain the long term
dimming, so that idea is pretty much out.

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:52.079
But maybe the slow fade is evidence of something
else.

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:56.529
Some of the first explanations proposed dust
from early planets forming, could be the cause,

00:01:56.529 --> 00:01:59.709
but Tabby’s star is too old to just be forming
planets now.

00:01:59.709 --> 00:02:04.569
One idea put forward in 2016 is kind of the
opposite; instead of a new planet, what we’re

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:06.899
seeing is the aftermath of an ex-planet.

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.939
One that crashed into the star about 10,000
years ago, causing a flare up that the star

00:02:10.939 --> 00:02:14.810
is slowly coming down from, like a long drawn
out belch.

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.131
That could account for the long term evidence,
while orbiting remnants of the planet cause

00:02:18.131 --> 00:02:20.760
the more dramatic short term drops in brightness.

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.909
After this latest dip, yet another idea has
emerged.

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:28.180
What if it’s a really really big planet
and some buddies?

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.319
Trojan asteroids are rocky bodies that share
the orbit of a planet.

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:35.049
They hang out in Lagrange points where the
gravitational forces between the star and

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:36.700
planet are balanced.

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.540
Jupiter has big groups of trojan asteroids
so we’ve seen the phenomenon happen before.

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.420
Maybe the Trojans caused those erratic dips,
and the massive planet caused some of the

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:46.500
more regular ones.

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.010
For this explanation the planet would have
to be about 5 times the size of Jupiter though,

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.300
and Jupiter is just about as big as a planet
can get before it starts fusing hydrogen and

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:56.360
becomes a star.

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.840
But the nice thing about this idea is it makes
a prediction: if it’s true, the Trojan asteroids

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:06.109
will transit again in 2021, followed by the
gigantic planet in 2023.

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:11.480
Until then we’re just going to keep our
eyes on the skies in case KIC 8462852 decides

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.030
to do anything else weird.
