00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.980
PROFESSOR: The isoclines applet.

00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:04.019
Let's explore
graphs of solutions

00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:09.960
of differential equations using
direction fields and isoclines.

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.890
The first thing to do
is to choose an equation

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:15.570
from the pull-down menu here.

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.180
And for this
demonstration, I will

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.310
choose the
differential equation y

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.650
prime equals y squared minus x.

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:27.160
In the window at left, you
can see the direction or slope

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.530
field drawn.

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:32.509
This is a representation of
the differential equation.

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:36.800
When I move the cursor
over this window,

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.560
a readout of the x-
and y-coordinates

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.370
shows up on the right-hand
side of the screen.

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:45.640
This is very useful in
making measurements.

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.960
If I click on the
graphing window,

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.680
the solution through the point
that I've clicked on is drawn.

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.930
This is an interesting
function, probably one

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:57.420
you've never seen before.

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.760
Certainly, it's not an
elementary function.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.519
Clicking some more points
makes more solutions appear.

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.670
In fact, every
point on this plane

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.930
has exactly one
solution through it.

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:19.910
This is the meaning of the
existence and uniqueness

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:24.330
theorem for
differential equations.

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.500
Now, let's clear the solutions
using this button down here,

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.140
Clear Solutions button.

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.330
You see a blank screen again.

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:37.600
You can control how the slope
field looks by using this Slope

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.080
Field toggle here.

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:41.885
You can make them
blank, or bright

00:01:41.885 --> 00:01:44.530
for a display, for example.

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.220
Or the way it was originally.

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.220
And I think I'm going to
turn it off altogether,

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.110
so now we're faced
with a blank screen.

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.890
Now, how would you go about
drawing some solutions

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.280
to this differential
equation by hand just knowing

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.410
the differential equation
and this blank screen?

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.490
Well, isoclines give you
a good way of doing this,

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.169
and they reveal things about
the qualitative behavior

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:11.560
of the differential
equation as well.

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.160
An isocline is the subset
of the plane where the slope

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.010
field takes on a given value.

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.380
I can choose that value,
m, using this slider here.

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.190
And when I click
here and move this,

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.000
the isocline with
the given value of m

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.690
is drawn in yellow
on the screen.

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.520
And you can see the value of
the slope field drawn as well.

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:40.350
So here is the value is
1, and the slope field

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:45.950
is given by little intervals
of value 1, of slope 1.

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.340
I can choose that value
using the slider marked m.

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.510
If I click on the
handle and drag it,

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.920
you see the isocline for
the corresponding value

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.750
of m drawn on the screen.

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.170
And on the isocline is also
drawn the direction fields.

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.610
So when m is 2, the
direction field has slope 2.

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.290
And when I drag the
slider back down to 0,

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.920
the isocline value 0 has a
horizontal direction field

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.720
marked along it.

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.230
Each one of these
is a curve where

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:25.370
y squared minus x equals m,
or x equals y squared minus m.

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:27.930
This is a parabola
lying on its side

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:32.870
with the vertex at
x equals negative m.

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:37.340
Let's draw the isocline
for value 1, for example.

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.700
I've now released the
mouse key, and the isocline

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:42.300
is left behind.

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:45.440
And I can easily draw
in some other isoclines

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.480
as well by clicking on
different values of m

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:49.790
and releasing the mouse key.

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:57.300
So once you've drawn several of
these isoclines on the plane,

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:03.690
it's pretty easy to envision
what the solutions will

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:04.940
look like to this curve.

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:08.160
You just have to thread your way
along the part of the direction

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.830
field that you've drawn.

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:14.810
I can check that by
clicking on the screen

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:17.220
and drawing a solution in.

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:18.970
This is quite easy
to do by hand.

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:21.130
It's easy to draw the
isoclines and then

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:22.615
sketch a solution accordingly.

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:29.525
But you can see other things
as well from isoclines.

00:04:29.525 --> 00:04:35.270
I'm going to clear all of
these and redraw the m equals

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:36.895
0 isocline on the screen.

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:44.760
And I think I'm going to
redraw the slope field as well.

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:48.850
Now, critical
points of a function

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:52.180
occur where the
derivative is equal to 0.

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:55.400
And the derivative is exactly
what we know about the solution

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.140
to a differential equation.

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:00.620
So the critical points,
the minima or maxima

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:03.030
of solutions to this
differential equation,

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:09.240
occur when the solution crosses
the m equals 0 isocline, also

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.040
known as the nullcline.

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:15.640
All maxima and minima of
solutions to this differential

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:19.840
equation occur along this
particular yellow parabola.

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:22.520
I can check that by
drawing in some solutions,

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:28.670
and you can see that these
functions have maxima which

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:31.870
occur just along that parabola.

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:33.620
If the solutions
miss the parabola,

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:35.255
they don't have any
critical points.

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:43.580
Another thing you can
see from this picture

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:47.200
is that apparently
many of the solutions

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:49.920
to this differential
equation cluster

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:53.550
near to this branch
of the nullcline.

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:59.070
And maybe we can see why this
is using the isocline picture.

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:03.130
I'm going to clear the solutions
now to make the picture clearer

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:07.555
and draw in one more
isocline, namely

00:06:07.555 --> 00:06:10.100
the m equals minus 1 isocline.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.240
Now, suppose that a solution
finds itself below the m

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:19.120
equals minus 1 isocline.

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:22.540
So it's in here somewhere.

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:26.850
Can it ever cross the m
equals minus 1 isocline?

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:30.460
Once it's below it,
can it ever cross it?

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:32.410
Well, it's below it.

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:36.400
So if it crosses the m
equals minus 1 isocline,

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:38.720
it must cross it
with a slope which

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:45.190
is bigger than the slope
of that yellow curve.

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:47.880
But when it crosses
it, it also has

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:52.810
to cross it with slope
minus 1, because this is

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:55.750
the m equals minus 1 isocline.

00:06:55.750 --> 00:07:01.040
But the slope of this yellow
parabola is bigger than minus 1

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:06.390
along here, and so the solution
curve can never cross it.

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:09.040
Similarly, suppose that
you have a solution which

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:12.560
is above the nullcline.

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:15.490
Can it ever cross the nullcline?

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:17.840
Well, if it crosses
the nullcline,

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:21.930
it must cross it from above,
so when it crosses it,

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:27.730
its slope must be less than the
slope of the nullcline, which

00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:30.330
is negative as you can see.

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:33.540
But when the solution
crosses the nullcline,

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:36.940
it must cross it with slope 0.

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:39.450
And so, that can't happen.

00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:46.210
And so you see, if a solution
is between those two isoclines,

00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:49.280
then it stays between
them forever more.

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:51.260
It's trapped between them.

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.666
This is called a funnel.

00:07:53.666 --> 00:07:55.750
It's trapped between
these two things,

00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:58.770
and gets closer and closer,
because these two isoclines

00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:04.440
become asymptotic
as x gets large.

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:06.550
These are called fences as well.

00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:10.500
Once a solution is in
here, it can't cross

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:13.480
either of these two fences.

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:18.100
This let's us estimate the
value of solutions for large x.

00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:20.260
These solutions,
anyway, for large x.

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:26.510
For example, if x
is equal to 100,

00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:30.590
the solution has to be
bigger than the value

00:08:30.590 --> 00:08:35.360
of this parabola, which is minus
10, and less than the value

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:40.809
along this parabola, which is
minus the square root of 99.

00:08:40.809 --> 00:08:42.919
So you get a very good
estimate for the value

00:08:42.919 --> 00:08:47.591
of solutions for large x from
these kinds of considerations.

00:08:47.591 --> 00:08:51.490
One more thing you can see
from this applet is this.

00:08:51.490 --> 00:08:57.070
If a solution is well
above the nullcline,

00:08:57.070 --> 00:09:00.200
it gets caught in
this powerful updraft

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:02.450
and goes off to infinity.

00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:06.040
In fact, all these
solutions become tangent

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:08.130
to vertical lines.

00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:12.280
They don't continue
for all large x.

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:15.230
They blow up in finite time.

00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:18.540
On the other hand, if you're
just a little bit smaller

00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:21.400
than these solutions,
then you get

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:24.860
solutions which
cross the nullcline,

00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:27.590
get trapped into
this parabolic region

00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:30.780
and fall down in between
our funnel, down here,

00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:35.700
and so become asymptotic to
minus the square root of x

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:38.450
when x gets large.

00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:40.670
There's just one
solution which doesn't

00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:43.960
do either of these very
different behaviors,

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:47.770
and it's right along here.

00:09:47.770 --> 00:09:51.780
It becomes asymptotic
to the positive branch

00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:55.250
of the parabola, and
every solution above it

00:09:55.250 --> 00:09:58.740
blows up in finite time,
and every solution below it

00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:01.520
falls down and becomes
asymptotic to minus

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:03.200
the square root of x.

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:06.170
This special solution-- which
doesn't do either of those two

00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:08.220
behaviors, but
continues to exist

00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:10.950
for all positive
values of x and become

00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:13.440
asymptotic to the
square root of x-- this

00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:15.550
is called the separatrix.

00:10:15.550 --> 00:10:19.500
It separates solutions showing
two very different types

00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:24.694
of behavior, the ones that fall
down and the ones that blow up.

00:10:24.694 --> 00:10:26.360
Well, these are just
a few of the things

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:28.190
you can understand
using this applet.

00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:32.640
Play with different menu items.

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:35.365
Open a copy of this applet
in your browser window.

00:10:35.365 --> 00:10:36.840
Play with some other menu items.

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:41.120
Maybe the default item
at the bottom of this

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:44.100
pull down menu down here.

00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:45.150
Are there funnels?

00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:47.380
Are there separatrices?

00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:51.150
What happens to solutions as x
goes to minus infinity rather

00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:53.350
than x equals plus infinity?

00:10:53.350 --> 00:10:57.030
Where are the critical points
of solutions of this equation?
