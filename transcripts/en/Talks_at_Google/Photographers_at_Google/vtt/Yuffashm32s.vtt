&gt;&gt;Cliff: So good afternoon everyone. I'd like
to welcome you to another outstanding authors

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:09.101
at Google talk. Today we're very pleased to
host Trey Ratcliff, who is a famous travel

00:00:09.101 --> 00:00:14.530
photographer and the publisher of the well-known
blog stuckincustoms.com which is, of course,

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:19.630
on my list of Websites to visit every day.
There's always an awesome image there.

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:24.560
Trey's one of the, he's one of the pioneers
of the HDR method of photography and he's

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:31.890
one of the main popularizers of the movement.
And so, the technique aims to make photography

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.970
fall more in line with what the human eye
sees in terms of capturing the dynamic range

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:43.920
in a single image. And the technique has really
taken off quite a bit. Trey's work is, was

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.430
the first HDR photograph to be exhibited in
the Smithsonian Institution.

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:53.820
He recently released a book that details the
practice and method of HDR photography. Many

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.600
of you have it in front of you. It's called
A World in HDR, and he'll be able to sign

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.600
some copies after the end of our talk today.
And of course, we here at Google are really

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.290
passionate about photography, whether it's
through our Google Photo Club we have here,

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.220
or the work that we do organizing and making
universally accessible the pictures of the

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:18.130
world ? whether it's through Picasa or through
our partnerships with Panamarina and the Gigapixel

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:23.500
program. So we'll also have a Q &amp; A mic at
the end of the talk for any questions you

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.780
may have; and please use the mic for our YouTube
audience.

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.979
And then please join me in welcoming Trey
as he discusses the surprising art and science

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:32.521
of HDR photography. Thank you.

00:01:32.521 --> 00:01:33.521
[applause]

00:01:33.521 --> 00:01:38.950
&gt;&gt;Trey Ratcliff: Thank you very much.

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:47.229
Hi y'all. Um, I am very excited to be here.
My name is Trey Ratcliff. I'll be talking

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:54.070
about the unexpected science and art of HDR
photography.

00:01:54.070 --> 00:02:00.591
So, you know, I gotta tell you, I am totally
excited to be here. I'm, at Google. You know

00:02:00.591 --> 00:02:06.970
it's cool. It's cool to be a geek now, isn't
it? It didn't used to be cool to be a geek

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:12.740
when I was in high school. Believe me it wasn't
cool at all. But now it's alright. And also,

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:18.270
another reason that I'm happy to be here and
share this stuff with you, is you know, you

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:25.640
guys Google as a team, you've done so much
for me and my family over the past few years.

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:31.940
You've really changed my life. You have. And
it's been wonderful. And so I'm happy to share

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.520
this back with you and with everybody watching
it at home or at work, when they're supposed

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:40.660
to be working or whatever.

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.690
Everyone's been very supportive. I was stuck
in customs and I'm very happy to give back.

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:48.840
I love HDR photography. And I think by the
end of this, you will love it as much as I

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:57.650
do. So let's get started.
So yes, HDR is very controversial. There's

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:05.410
a lot of old school photographers that just
think HDR is the devil incarnate. And, of

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:09.709
course, I don't agree with that. You guys
are all adults, you're grownups, you can look

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:14.980
at this and decide for yourself what you think
of it.

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:22.250
This is an HDR photo. HDR is an acronym for
High Dynamic Range. And in short, what it

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:26.830
does is it allows you to capture in a final
image the same thing that you can see when

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:33.069
you're actually there on the scene.
This is accomplished in a variety of ways.

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:36.849
Normally it's done by taking multiple photos
of a scene. But it can also be done with a

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:45.560
single raw photo as well. Like Cliff was mentioning,
this is sort of HDR's entree into the mainstream.

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:51.129
This is the first HDR photo to hang in the
Smithsonian. This is of Austin, Texas where

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:58.250
I live. This made my Mom very proud when that
happened. And I think it's beautiful. This

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:01.769
is how I remember these things.

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:08.070
This is a non-HDR photo. I'll show you the
HDR version in a minute. This ran in the New

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:15.739
York Times. A gentleman named John Tierney
has a blog there called "Tierney Labs." I

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:18.850
suggest you guys go read it if you're into
science and whatnot. It's a great science

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:24.100
blog. And he asked readers of the New York
Times, what's more realistic this or the HDR

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:28.660
version? And there was a healthy debate on
there as you'd expect.

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:35.530
But this actually gives me a good occasion
to describe what HDR is. This is a normal

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:40.300
photo taken with a normal camera. Actually
I took this with a really expensive Nikon

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:45.690
camera. A D3X, like a $9,000 camera. And this
is about the best you can do without setting

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:49.540
up lights and soft boxes and all that mess.
Who really has the time for that? That's a

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:55.490
lot of effort, right? Who travels with all
that stuff anyway? And this isn't what I see

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:56.490
when I'm there.

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:04.020
When I'm there, I see this. This is what I
see. I can see all the individual puzzle pieces.

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:10.240
I can see all the detail outside. I can see
the warmth of the wood grain. It all makes

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:14.490
sense to me. It's natural. Your eye scans
around and sees all of this stuff. Now the

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:19.370
way this is accomplished is you normally take
multiple photos of the same scene: a dark

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:25.720
one; a normal one; and a bright one. And then
HDR is an algorithm, right, that runs across

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:31.930
this photo. It does pixel by pixel and it
picks out the best pixel from the various

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:35.330
images based on some setting and uses that.

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:39.790
So it's different than compositing, it actually
happens on a pixel by pixel level. And it's

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:43.949
actually quite analogous to what the human
eye does. It scans a scene. You know your

00:05:43.949 --> 00:05:47.770
eye doesn't operate like a camera; you don't
capture a jpeg and store it in your brain.

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:55.190
You build this patchwork quilt. This neural
network of the scene.

00:05:55.190 --> 00:06:00.750
This is a very good example of something that
only HDR photography can accomplish. You know

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:04.340
you guys been in these situations where you
look maybe not right into the sun, but you

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:08.009
look towards the sun and you can still see
the golden fields, you can still see the blue

00:06:08.009 --> 00:06:13.280
sky, the clouds, it just makes sense. And
the only way to get something like this, is

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:17.570
really with HDR photography. And I think it
comes out beautiful and it makes sense. And

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:18.570
it feels right.

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:23.830
[pause]

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:29.030
This is a remote bamboo forest in Japan and
it was kind of misty that day, and there was

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:33.080
just a nice feeling in there. You know when
you see this you think, is that a photo, what

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:38.820
is that? If you can release what you know
of as a photo, something new can enter your

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:43.431
world. Right, it feels right. It feels like
more than a photo. Because when I was there

00:06:43.431 --> 00:06:48.699
it felt like more than a place. It was a wonderful
experience. And I think by using some of these

00:06:48.699 --> 00:06:52.361
new techniques, you can eventuate what it
actually felt like to be there.

00:06:52.361 --> 00:06:53.361
[pause]

00:06:53.361 --> 00:07:04.590
This is the Taj Mahal in India, of course.
Um, a beautiful place and so many times when

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:08.419
you, you know you don't have to travel to
exotic locations to do HDR photography. That's

00:07:08.419 --> 00:07:13.009
just sort of an excuse. You can do beautiful
HDR work anywhere. But when you are in these

00:07:13.009 --> 00:07:18.819
places that move you, right. Whether it's
a great architectural location or someplace

00:07:18.819 --> 00:07:23.270
that just means something to you, you might
notice that you come back with photos and

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:27.650
you show photos to people and you say "well,
you had to be there." Right. That's, that's

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:32.789
an awful thing to say. It's 2010. You don't
have to say that anymore. Now there's technology

00:07:32.789 --> 00:07:36.160
and algorithms and software that can eventuate
in the final picture; what you actually experienced

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:38.400
when you were on the scene.

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:43.160
I had wonderful feelings when I was here.
I set up on a tripod to take this shot. It

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:48.630
wasn't quite low enough so I, I had to take
the Nikon off the tripod and bury it in the

00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:53.830
mud right by the. I hated doing it. It was
painful and I went back to the hotel room

00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:58.550
and I made up all night and I cleaned it in
the hotel and made sure it was all clean and

00:07:58.550 --> 00:08:04.479
I felt horrible for my Nikon, but it forgave
me eventually. I think it came out very nice.

00:08:04.479 --> 00:08:12.680
Uh, this is another part of the Taj Mahal.
Now I, I mentioned earlier that you take an

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:17.000
HDR photo by taking multiple original photos
and combining them. Well you don't always

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:22.060
have to do that. You can also do it with just
one raw photo. That one raw photo contains

00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:27.491
a lot of light information. I refer to it
sometimes as a cube of light. And you can

00:08:27.491 --> 00:08:30.210
pull out amazing tones and detail within that.

00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:35.440
[pause]

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:41.899
This is a beautiful treetop temple in Kyoto,
Japan. And this was a multi-exposure shot

00:08:41.899 --> 00:08:50.230
and the quick exposure got all of the light
inside of the temple. The warmth. The long

00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:55.089
exposure got these little fire lights down
there. These little Ewok villages or whatever

00:08:55.089 --> 00:08:59.740
they are. It just, it feels nice, right? And
this is what I felt when I was there.

00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:04.779
[pause]

00:09:04.779 --> 00:09:13.009
This is a temple in northern India in Agra
and, um, I'd set up for a normal HDR shot,

00:09:13.009 --> 00:09:20.290
multiple exposures and then this Muslim woman
started gliding through this temple. And I

00:09:20.290 --> 00:09:24.679
quickly made some adjustments to the settings
'cause I was gonna capture her as a single

00:09:24.679 --> 00:09:33.009
raw HDR. And at times like this you, you can't
over think the aperture and the iso and all

00:09:33.009 --> 00:09:36.410
these numbers. You'll just, by the time you
figure all that stuff out, you know, you're,

00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:41.699
the moment's passed. So you have to be a little
bit like Luke and turn off the targeting computer.

00:09:41.699 --> 00:09:47.019
[laughter] And just let it flow. Right? And
that's when you're really taking photos and

00:09:47.019 --> 00:09:48.290
really experiencing the world.

00:09:48.290 --> 00:09:52.980
[pause]

00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:59.889
This is the Perito Moreno glacier in southern
Argentina. In Lago, Argentina. These places

00:09:59.889 --> 00:10:04.220
are wonderful subjects for HDR photography.
All landscape is. If you're into landscape

00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:07.600
photography, and you've been doing it for
a long time, this is a great excuse to go

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:13.600
out and redo it all. Because now you can capture
everything as you originally saw it. If you

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:20.230
see those dark bits of blue, those are icebergs
that have turned over. And that's the clearness

00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:21.230
underneath.

00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:22.920
[pause]

00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:31.299
Um, this is Chicago. Um, this is another good
example of an HDR taken from a single raw

00:10:31.299 --> 00:10:39.189
photo. Um, I have this great fan and friend
there that, she rented a helicopter for me

00:10:39.189 --> 00:10:44.449
for four hours. And we took the door off and
I hung out shooting the sunset for four hours.

00:10:44.449 --> 00:10:49.100
It was awesome. And I sent out a Tweet on
the way up and, the doors helicopter, the

00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:54.129
doors off and made my Mom very nervous. It
makes me wonder, why do we invite our Mom's

00:10:54.129 --> 00:10:59.249
to Twitter and Facebook and everything. What
are we thinkin'? Um, but everything turned

00:10:59.249 --> 00:11:02.610
out okay. And this ended bein' a pretty good
shot.

00:11:02.610 --> 00:11:04.760
[pause]

00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:12.110
Ah, here's another wonderful example of HDR.
You know you guys have been places like this

00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:18.389
where it's, this is Montana. It's cold outside;
night is falling; there's wildlife around.

00:11:18.389 --> 00:11:24.149
You see a warm, cozy cabin. There's a fire
inside. There's hot food. There's nice people.

00:11:24.149 --> 00:11:27.759
You just wanna go inside, but you kinda want
to take your time and appreciate it as you

00:11:27.759 --> 00:11:28.759
go in.

00:11:28.759 --> 00:11:36.299
I think HDR helps to tell that story. It feels
right to me. This is what I see; what I experience.

00:11:36.299 --> 00:11:42.170
And I can teach everyone in this room and
everyone watching at home how to do this stuff.

00:11:42.170 --> 00:11:47.269
I've taught tens of thousands of people around
the world how to do it. People just like you:

00:11:47.269 --> 00:11:52.179
beginner; intermediate; advanced; you're an
old pro trying to learn new tricks. Within

00:11:52.179 --> 00:11:57.980
an hour you can be up and runnin' with this
stuff. Um, stuckincustoms.com I have an HDR

00:11:57.980 --> 00:12:03.149
tutorial. It's free. And you'll have a great
time doing it. That's one of the dirty secrets

00:12:03.149 --> 00:12:07.049
of HDR. It's totally fun. And at the end of
that hour, you're gonna have something that

00:12:07.049 --> 00:12:12.549
you can show your friends, your family. You'll
impress all of 'em. And most importantly you'll

00:12:12.549 --> 00:12:17.139
impress yourself. Right? That's why we do
this stuff to, so that you're interesting

00:12:17.139 --> 00:12:21.569
to yourself. That's why you continue education
after you're outta college. Not so that you're

00:12:21.569 --> 00:12:26.819
interesting to other people, that's you know,
that's bs. You want to be interesting to yourself.

00:12:26.819 --> 00:12:28.519
'Cause you're the central character in your
story.

00:12:28.519 --> 00:12:34.119
[pause]

00:12:34.119 --> 00:12:39.239
Um, this is a tip of my hat to Google Earth.
I love Google Earth and I sometimes envision

00:12:39.239 --> 00:12:43.989
myself sort of like this old world explorer
that would span maps out on the table and

00:12:43.989 --> 00:12:48.170
mark places I want to go. I do it all with
Google Earth now. I find these remarkable

00:12:48.170 --> 00:12:50.059
places that I really wanna go get there.

00:12:50.059 --> 00:12:57.750
Um, this is at the very southern tip of Patagonia.
And I was tryin' to get over that hill closer

00:12:57.750 --> 00:13:01.170
to those mountains. But actually when you
get there you think "oh my gosh, how do I

00:13:01.170 --> 00:13:06.160
even get over, that looked so easy on Google
Earth." Um, [laughs] and so it's a problem.

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:12.109
So this night we couldn't make it; night was
falling and, ah, but even when things don't

00:13:12.109 --> 00:13:16.399
go according to plan, you can still find a
way to make a great shot. There's still beautiful

00:13:16.399 --> 00:13:21.220
things all around. So, I went back that night.
I was actually there with these five Russians.

00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:27.600
My tent mate was this 300 pound guy named,
Uri, and he was just the worst tent mate.

00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:31.180
He smelled like the inside of a tom-tom and
he was just the worst.

00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:37.189
And the next morning we woke up at dark a.m.
and it was me and this other guy who is ex-Soviet

00:13:37.189 --> 00:13:41.860
military. Super tough guy. And we climbed
up thousands of feet very, very quickly up

00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:47.249
this icy, sketchy trail. We went over a mountain
trying to get to where we wanted to go, and

00:13:47.249 --> 00:13:54.350
we eventually got this place. And it was perfect.
Just lovely.

00:13:54.350 --> 00:13:58.710
And again, this is the only kind of thing
that can be accomplished with HDR photography.

00:13:58.710 --> 00:14:03.870
Because if I was to expose just for the sky
and the mountain, then the snow would have

00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:09.579
been almost pitch black. And it wasn't pitch
black. It had a nice blue glow to it. And

00:14:09.579 --> 00:14:14.250
those little footprints there where I walked
over, I got on all fours and drank out of

00:14:14.250 --> 00:14:18.930
the water like a horse. It was, it was really
nice. It's a nice experience. And that, that

00:14:18.930 --> 00:14:23.249
line you see, that's the mountain that I had
just come over. It was casting a shadow. Kind

00:14:23.249 --> 00:14:27.609
of made a nice horizon there.

00:14:27.609 --> 00:14:28.609
[pause]

00:14:28.609 --> 00:14:35.590
Let's talk a little bit about the brain. Um,
not until you trick your brain do you start

00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:43.410
to realize all the things it's doing for you.
I love this cube. This is from this German

00:14:43.410 --> 00:14:51.559
researcher named Moloto. And this cube alone
makes the case for HDR. Do you see the brown

00:14:51.559 --> 00:14:56.629
square on top and the yellow square in the
middle? Those are the exact same color. Now

00:14:56.629 --> 00:15:01.779
if I'm gonna sit here and say the outside
brown is the exact same color as inside yellow,

00:15:01.779 --> 00:15:05.509
you'd think I'm just totally crazy. I'll prove
it in a minute.

00:15:05.509 --> 00:15:10.420
But let's think about where does this fiction
of color come from? It actually comes from

00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:16.269
our parents. When you're two, three, four
years old, that's when you learn your colors.

00:15:16.269 --> 00:15:20.160
What happens is, you know, you have a blue
ball and you go outside and your Mom says

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:25.040
"the ball is blue." And you go, "okay, the
ball's blue." And you go back inside and then

00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:29.369
your Mom says "the ball is blue." You're like
"okay, the ball is blue." And then let's say

00:15:29.369 --> 00:15:33.769
you have a brown crayon, right? It's always
the longest one because it doesn't get used,

00:15:33.769 --> 00:15:38.089
right? It always the, that's the one that
nobody uses 'cause it ugly. So you go outside

00:15:38.089 --> 00:15:43.499
and the label on it says brown and then you
go inside and the label on it still says brown.

00:15:43.499 --> 00:15:48.500
Right? Well you know, is Crayola Corporation,
is this a huge conspiracy of color? You know

00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:52.749
what, why doesn't it change? You know these
are actually very different colors and we

00:15:52.749 --> 00:15:58.209
grow up in this sort of colorful fiction of
naming these things in our world.

00:15:58.209 --> 00:16:07.140
Let me show you that these are the exact same
color. Go back and forth. Cool. [pause] So

00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:11.609
perception ? they say intelligence is the
ability to quickly recognize patterns in your

00:16:11.609 --> 00:16:17.509
neural network. Um, half the people in here
see a rabbit, the other half of the people

00:16:17.509 --> 00:16:24.160
see a duck. What's interesting is that your
brain tries to wrap a reality around everything

00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:28.810
it's seeing. And it's your left brain that's
doing its best to categorize it and make sense

00:16:28.810 --> 00:16:33.669
out of it. Your right brain is actually enjoying
the ambiguity and surfing around in it ? and

00:16:33.669 --> 00:16:36.929
wondering ? right, its enjoying that. Your
left brain is struggling with it and trying

00:16:36.929 --> 00:16:40.919
to figure out what is this thing. And the
two play together very nicely in an interesting

00:16:40.919 --> 00:16:41.919
way.

00:16:41.919 --> 00:16:43.689
[pause]

00:16:43.689 --> 00:16:47.799
We do swim in waves. I forget who said it,
it might have been Einstein, something to

00:16:47.799 --> 00:16:52.249
the effect of a fish can never discover the
water in which it swims. Well, we're actually

00:16:52.249 --> 00:16:56.519
smart enough to know that there's this rich
spectrum out there of waves and we only see

00:16:56.519 --> 00:17:01.619
a very small bit of it ? the EM spectrum.
But we can do amazing things within that,

00:17:01.619 --> 00:17:05.199
especially in terms of dark and light. And
we have this rich fiction that we've been

00:17:05.199 --> 00:17:08.929
lying to ourselves all about, about how to
navigate this world, especially the world

00:17:08.929 --> 00:17:11.110
of light and shadow.

00:17:11.110 --> 00:17:17.360
In this example, both a and b are the exact
same shade of gray. To prove it, I'll have

00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:22.611
this gray bar come and cover both. [pause]
Cool.

00:17:22.611 --> 00:17:25.059
[pause]

00:17:25.059 --> 00:17:30.019
In this one, the green face towards the top
is the same shade of green as the green face

00:17:30.019 --> 00:17:33.100
facing down. Here comes a green bar to prove
it.

00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:37.559
[pause]

00:17:37.559 --> 00:17:42.320
In this example, all of the blues are the
exact same brightness and intensity. Here

00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:46.810
comes a blue square to cover it up. [pause]
Cool.

00:17:46.810 --> 00:17:49.789
[pause]

00:17:49.789 --> 00:17:55.330
So, maybe it takes a while for your head to
get around the idea of color and whatnot.

00:17:55.330 --> 00:18:03.640
Um, but HDR is really about light more than
it's about color. So, the way to understand

00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:07.240
the way light works is to think about how
your brain reacts to it.

00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:12.809
I got this example from, um, Dr. David Eagleman.
Uh, he's at the University of Houston. He's

00:18:12.809 --> 00:18:19.450
a brain researcher. And whenever you see a
scene your brain will immediately adjust to

00:18:19.450 --> 00:18:23.840
the black, the gray, and the white. And that
will become your reality until something else

00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:28.169
comes along that's even whiter. Right? And
you go, "oh, that's my new white." Right?

00:18:28.169 --> 00:18:31.260
And you kind of trick yourself and go "oh,
that really wasn't white before, I was just

00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:35.019
kiddin' around. This is the new white." Right,
and you kinda lie to yourself like that. And

00:18:35.019 --> 00:18:39.080
if something else comes along that's even
more white you go "oh, that's my new white."

00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:43.950
Alright. And so think about this: when you
take photos and you show them to people, they

00:18:43.950 --> 00:18:48.130
are gonna be entering your world for a few
seconds, maybe more if you're lucky. And when

00:18:48.130 --> 00:18:53.279
they're looking at your world, they will adjust
the dark and light to whatever you've set

00:18:53.279 --> 00:18:57.450
up in there. Don't worry about going from
the extreme dark to the extreme light. They

00:18:57.450 --> 00:19:01.370
will become relatively proficient at understanding
the light levels inside of your photo for

00:19:01.370 --> 00:19:04.880
that time period. And, of course, that's not
white, that is white.

00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:06.510
[laughter]

00:19:06.510 --> 00:19:14.470
So we do swim in these waves and we only see
a very small bit of it. Um, within the EM

00:19:14.470 --> 00:19:20.389
spectrum, ah, we have this ah, this notion
that the, the impressionists came to know.

00:19:20.389 --> 00:19:25.090
I study the impressionist intensely. Back
then there wasn't such a separation of art

00:19:25.090 --> 00:19:28.529
and science like there is today. There's a
problem with our educational system in which

00:19:28.529 --> 00:19:32.909
art and science are on these orthogonal paths.
I don't think they're that different. I think

00:19:32.909 --> 00:19:37.230
the more you know about one, the better you
can be at another.

00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:43.419
So the impressionists, um, Monet, Renoir,
Manet, Chabot, Degas. These were masters of

00:19:43.419 --> 00:19:48.620
light. And they had trouble because they used
pigments, right, not pixels like I'm able

00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:53.730
to use. And so to make a pure yellow, they
had, they had a lot of trouble getting a pure

00:19:53.730 --> 00:19:58.299
yellow pigment so they would take a green
dot and put it by a red dot. And they knew

00:19:58.299 --> 00:20:02.460
that at yea distance away from the canvas
the light would mix and give an impression

00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:04.759
of yellow.

00:20:04.759 --> 00:20:10.080
Well, we can't do that same sort of things,
we use pixels. But we do similar type tricks.

00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:15.380
We understand the way the eye works and with
certain tricks you can make things glow and

00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:16.559
feel like they really do.

00:20:16.559 --> 00:20:19.450
[pause]

00:20:19.450 --> 00:20:24.200
Y'all might remember this from, uh, science
class in high school. This is part of the

00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:32.250
EM spectrum. Um, we can only see from 400
nanometers to 700 nanometers. Uh, within that

00:20:32.250 --> 00:20:37.730
we can do an amazing amount of stuff. Now
here's something very interesting. Just beyond

00:20:37.730 --> 00:20:43.640
700 nanometers, just beyond the reds you get
into the infrared and thermal IR.

00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:49.870
So where your eyes stop with color, your skin
begins with heat. Right?

00:20:49.870 --> 00:20:54.549
You can think of your skin as an extension
of your eyes. When you're there on a scene,

00:20:54.549 --> 00:20:58.549
you're pulling in everything into your neural
network. Right? Your brain is recording this

00:20:58.549 --> 00:21:03.019
information. The analog of between computers
and man breaks down at some point because

00:21:03.019 --> 00:21:07.020
you don't store jpegs in your brain. You have
this rich assortment of colors and feelings

00:21:07.020 --> 00:21:11.120
and emotions and smells and the people you're
with, and previous barns that you've seen.

00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:16.289
All of this is in your neural network. What
feeds into that is also this heat that you're

00:21:16.289 --> 00:21:20.950
feeling. You remember if you were cold somewhere
or hot somewhere. So if you can start to play

00:21:20.950 --> 00:21:25.159
with some of these warm colors in your photo
 ? the oranges and red ? you can actually

00:21:25.159 --> 00:21:28.690
make the viewer feel warm at a subconscious
level.

00:21:28.690 --> 00:21:29.980
This is a Texas sunset.

00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:36.309
Now they don't think about this stuff it's,
uh, but it's there and it's quite real. And

00:21:36.309 --> 00:21:43.340
actually the absence of thermal IR, the absence
of reds is, is coldness. And by not using

00:21:43.340 --> 00:21:47.570
these colors in your photos, you can come
across some of these sorts of things: this

00:21:47.570 --> 00:21:55.520
is, this is at um, that's Fitzroy. This is
not too far from Antarctica. I don't add any

00:21:55.520 --> 00:22:00.539
colors. I don't change the colors in my photos.
This is how it really was. It was cold. It

00:22:00.539 --> 00:22:07.009
feels cold. And I think HDR helps to bring
out the proper light levels.

00:22:07.009 --> 00:22:11.659
So a friend and I started something called
HDR spotting not too long ago. We started

00:22:11.659 --> 00:22:20.299
with the intent of driving more traffic to
more HDR artists that are out there. I think

00:22:20.299 --> 00:22:24.870
that the economy is evolving. I think capitalism
is evolving. I think capitalism is fine, but

00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:29.179
I think there is a second currency out there
now called attention.

00:22:29.179 --> 00:22:35.120
And we've created what we call an attention
distribution engine. And as attention becomes

00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:40.759
more and more important, we think there's
a smarter way to distribute it around. So

00:22:40.759 --> 00:22:47.409
we started this HDR spotting and this gives
the ability, ah, to people to, to share their

00:22:47.409 --> 00:22:52.280
photos and drive traffic to their smug mug,
to their portfolio, to their blog, wherever

00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:59.440
they might want it. Uh, I think a lot of photo
sharing sites kinda stopped, um, stopped innovating

00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:03.600
quite awhile ago. And I think there's newer,
better ways to do this. And this doesn't just

00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:08.080
work for HDR, it works for any kind of photography,
or any kind of art for that matter.

00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:11.741
Uh, we're still in beta. It's invite only.
You have to know someone to get in. You know

00:23:11.741 --> 00:23:16.750
how this works at Google. But, um, we um,
don't ask me for codes. I don't hand 'em out,

00:23:16.750 --> 00:23:20.789
but other people do, and as we get out of
beta it will become more and more available.

00:23:20.789 --> 00:23:25.460
Since I am encouraging everyone here to try
HDR and have fun with it and I know you can

00:23:25.460 --> 00:23:30.519
do it, I also encourage you to start sharing
on here. On the backend we have a system to

00:23:30.519 --> 00:23:35.700
make sure that, you know, people aren't uploading
porn or horse mpegs, or weird things. We want

00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:40.139
to make sure that they get the right level
of, of a, quality and whatnot, if it gets

00:23:40.139 --> 00:23:42.399
enough stars as editor's pick and so on and
so forth.

00:23:42.399 --> 00:23:48.259
We're doing our best to, to give back and
part of the problem I noticed is that I have,

00:23:48.259 --> 00:23:54.799
um, on my Flicker I have 21 million views
on my photos. And one photo might have a couple

00:23:54.799 --> 00:23:59.370
thousand, might have a couple hundred thousand.
Then I go look at my friend's photo, or even

00:23:59.370 --> 00:24:03.730
a stranger's photo, that's just as good, you
know, if not better. There's so many great

00:24:03.730 --> 00:24:07.610
HDR photographers out there. There's so many
great photographers of all kinds. And they

00:24:07.610 --> 00:24:11.669
might only have a few dozen views, right,
or a few hundred views and it just doesn't

00:24:11.669 --> 00:24:17.049
seem to add up, right? It's 'cause the Internet
is not properly distributing attention and

00:24:17.049 --> 00:24:20.230
getting the interesting kind of art to the
right kind of people.

00:24:20.230 --> 00:24:25.120
So now that HDR spawning people are getting
hundreds and thousands of views. It's just

00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:29.820
great and it's not a score card. Right? It's
just that, I think artists and all of us just

00:24:29.820 --> 00:24:35.640
want to share our stuff and why, I think,
we just wanna know we exist. Right? And as

00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:40.390
other people enter our world and as we affect
them, in minute ways we, we know we exist.

00:24:40.390 --> 00:24:45.570
And that's, I think that's important to everybody
whether you're an artist or not.

00:24:45.570 --> 00:24:46.570
[pause]

00:24:46.570 --> 00:24:53.190
So as we move forward in the digital world,
the, the idea of sharing art and being an

00:24:53.190 --> 00:25:00.430
artist is emerging. Um, I think we are approaching
this sort of singularity. Right? This is probably

00:25:00.430 --> 00:25:04.779
a good place to ask: how long do we have into
the singularity? About 15 years or so? We

00:25:04.779 --> 00:25:09.889
gotta a few more doublings between now and
then. What's gonna happen? I don't know, but

00:25:09.889 --> 00:25:14.960
I plan on having a good time between now and
then. Uh, it's gonna be tremendously fun.

00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:19.950
I think this is going to be a great decade
for artists. I think that now that people

00:25:19.950 --> 00:25:24.200
like Google and Twitter and all these other
great companies around world have wired up

00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:29.059
the left brain of the Internet, now it's the
creative sides that can come out and start

00:25:29.059 --> 00:25:31.730
using this infrastructure.

00:25:31.730 --> 00:25:37.860
This is Gullfoss in Iceland. It's this icy
waterfall. Um, ancient theologians used to

00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:42.950
think this was the entrance to hell. Hell
was originally a cold place in Dante's hell

00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:45.890
and they would advise that if, you know, you
had a loved one that you thought was in hell

00:25:45.890 --> 00:25:50.730
that you would come and dive down into here
to rescue them. I don't think it ever turned

00:25:50.730 --> 00:25:54.470
out very well, but [laughter] they uh, it
is a real slippery place.

00:25:54.470 --> 00:25:59.409
And um, I remember I was walkin' through and
I had my tripod and all that stuff and the

00:25:59.409 --> 00:26:05.299
ground was already super icy, and the mist
from the waterfall made these little beads

00:26:05.299 --> 00:26:10.840
of, of water and almost gave the ground this
negative friction. And I slipped out and I

00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:15.750
fell and I saved my camera, of course, [laughter]
and started sliding down, right? And there

00:26:15.750 --> 00:26:19.659
was this yellow rope above me and I reached
up and I grabbed the yellow rope and it saved

00:26:19.659 --> 00:26:24.610
me. Um, so as we're all kind of slipping down
towards this point, there's really no yellow

00:26:24.610 --> 00:26:29.200
rope anymore is there, we're just goin'. Um,
and I don't know what's gonna happen, but

00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:34.799
you know, I think it will be kind of fun and
I think it will be a good time.

00:26:34.799 --> 00:26:35.799
[pause]

00:26:35.799 --> 00:26:43.669
Um, so as we march forward there is a new
culture emerging, right? There is sort of

00:26:43.669 --> 00:26:48.590
an old culture which will always exist, but
people on the Internet they want beautiful

00:26:48.590 --> 00:26:52.149
to look at, they want beautiful things to
experience, they want nice music to listen

00:26:52.149 --> 00:26:58.400
to. And I think this will be the decade of
artists. I've very excited about it.

00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:03.769
So let's move through some, some images here.
Let me switch to a different presentation.

00:27:03.769 --> 00:27:06.600
[scratching sound]

00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:11.750
So this sort of a, a bunch of different pictures
from my portfolio that shows what you can

00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:16.930
do with HDR photography. This is my family.
My three kids at Christmas. I think it's a

00:27:16.930 --> 00:27:21.009
beautiful way to capture the world. This is
Christmas to me, right? Warm fires, happy

00:27:21.009 --> 00:27:23.869
kids, family. It's nice.

00:27:23.869 --> 00:27:28.940
This is Hong Kong. Cities are great in HDR.
It's a wonderful milieu for HDR photography.

00:27:28.940 --> 00:27:33.370
It you're into black and white photography,
you can also do amazing things. This will

00:27:33.370 --> 00:27:38.190
be all new textures to you, that you might
not have been ever able to pull out before.

00:27:38.190 --> 00:27:43.570
This is a HDR out of 90 shots. It was crazy.
I'll never do that again. [laughter] But it

00:27:43.570 --> 00:27:45.409
came out pretty good.

00:27:45.409 --> 00:27:51.139
This is in Chernobyl. Um, my Mom also was
not happy when she found out I was in Chernobyl.

00:27:51.139 --> 00:27:53.259
[laughter] Um, but it was really cool.

00:27:53.259 --> 00:28:01.190
Uh, this is what uh, an old school photographer
might call a, a subtle use of HDR. Right?

00:28:01.190 --> 00:28:05.660
It's very, you can just hear it, can't you?
This sort of dripping with condescension.

00:28:05.660 --> 00:28:10.990
They go "oh, I like HDR but only if it's subtly
applied." So, ah, wonderfully judgmental isn't

00:28:10.990 --> 00:28:17.299
it? Um, you know we hear that a lot. Me and,
there's so many HDR photographers out there

00:28:17.299 --> 00:28:23.820
that are good. Um, and um, I'm happy to fight
for them and fight for all of us because clearly

00:28:23.820 --> 00:28:27.581
this is the way that I see the world, the
way I experience it, and what makes sense

00:28:27.581 --> 00:28:29.899
to me.

00:28:29.899 --> 00:28:35.039
Um, I don't know about y'all, but I, this
is a really cool shot, isn't it? I would love

00:28:35.039 --> 00:28:38.129
to live in a house with a grass roof. It seems
cozy.

00:28:38.129 --> 00:28:46.029
Um, so when I go through life I picture, I
picture it like I'm in this Tolkienesque novel,

00:28:46.029 --> 00:28:52.389
right? And people and scenes come in and out
of my world. And I wanna be able to capture

00:28:52.389 --> 00:28:58.971
it as such. I see things in a rich, romantic,
kind of storyesque way. And I think this is

00:28:58.971 --> 00:29:02.970
a very nice way for me just to, you know,
document my own life and insofar as other

00:29:02.970 --> 00:29:09.480
people find it interesting that's great. Um,
you know, I think, ah, I think this is, ah,

00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:13.039
really, really fun way to experience and kind
of chronicle your life.

00:29:13.039 --> 00:29:21.299
Um, now technically I'll jump back and forth
between technical stuff and whatnot, but most

00:29:21.299 --> 00:29:28.149
of my images I would say are accomplished,
ah, from going from plus two to minus two.

00:29:28.149 --> 00:29:33.869
What does that mean? Well, most DSLR's have
a setting called autobracketing, right? Or

00:29:33.869 --> 00:29:41.639
exposure bracketing, where you take multiple
photos of a scene. Um, and that really means

00:29:41.639 --> 00:29:43.480
how quick the shutter speed is.

00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:49.110
So typically, let's say a three exposure HDR,
the minus two is the fast shutter speed, that's

00:29:49.110 --> 00:29:54.809
very dark, but all of the bright spots have
all of the details perfectly laid out. There's

00:29:54.809 --> 00:29:59.249
a normal shot at zero and there's a plus two
which is very bright and almost blown out.

00:29:59.249 --> 00:30:05.909
Except in that one the shadows are perfectly
exposed. So that range from minus two to plus

00:30:05.909 --> 00:30:10.409
two is good enough for 90 percent of situations.
I've heard some people say that the human

00:30:10.409 --> 00:30:15.270
eye can see 11 stops, right, instead of five
stops, which is plus two to minus two. I don't

00:30:15.270 --> 00:30:17.039
know if that's true. I don't know how you'd
measure that.

00:30:17.039 --> 00:30:21.690
Um, I know that when I go into a dark area
it takes me a few minutes to adjust, and maybe

00:30:21.690 --> 00:30:25.889
that gets me to the 11 stops. I'm not sure.
But I do know from experience, I've taken

00:30:25.889 --> 00:30:32.389
a ton of HDR shots, and plus two to minus
two is enough. Um, I shoot with a Nikon D3X

00:30:32.389 --> 00:30:39.690
and I have to take five exposures, I do minus
two, minus one, zero plus one, plus two. Only

00:30:39.690 --> 00:30:43.519
because I can't set mine just step by two.
I wish I could. I wish I could get in that

00:30:43.519 --> 00:30:46.549
firm wear. I, Nikon, I'm still waitin' for
your call.

00:30:46.549 --> 00:30:47.549
[laughter]

00:30:47.549 --> 00:30:51.960
Um, we need to fix this stuff up. I need to
get into there and hack this around.

00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:57.909
Um, now occasionally I will go plus three
to minus three when I'm shooting into the

00:30:57.909 --> 00:31:03.649
sun. Ah, because the sun, of course, there's
nothing brighter than that out there, and

00:31:03.649 --> 00:31:08.600
that seems to do the trick. That's seven exposures
for me from minus three to plus three. So

00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:14.379
I advise that everybody else does the same.
Most DSLR cameras have this setting. And all

00:31:14.379 --> 00:31:15.379
that's in the tutorial.

00:31:15.379 --> 00:31:18.210
[pause]

00:31:18.210 --> 00:31:22.330
Um, the other nice thing about the tutorial
is there is ah, a section at the end on how

00:31:22.330 --> 00:31:27.330
to do this with a single raw photo. So let's
say you've been taking photos for a long time

00:31:27.330 --> 00:31:33.000
and you have a lot of, a lot of photos that,
ah, are just sittin' around in raw. You can

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:39.539
go back and process those in HDR and have
a lot of fun with it. I advise that.

00:31:39.539 --> 00:31:46.370
So, ah, typically when I speak to groups I
notice that about 70 percent of people see

00:31:46.370 --> 00:31:51.289
the world like I do, in this rich, vibrant,
romantic way. Another 30 percent of people

00:31:51.289 --> 00:31:56.440
don?t. Right? They just see it in a different
way. Now these are not like the HDR haters.

00:31:56.440 --> 00:32:00.379
Right? I ignore them. They're not even in
my cone of vision. I picture like I'm playing

00:32:00.379 --> 00:32:04.149
a game and these are MPC's and I just ignore
these guys, right?

00:32:04.149 --> 00:32:08.809
But, ah, the other 30 percent just see the
world differently than me. Not better or worse,

00:32:08.809 --> 00:32:15.749
just different. When I see it, and probably
most of y'all see it, I look at, um, well

00:32:15.749 --> 00:32:20.549
you have this neural network in our brains,
right? And we, we pattern match, we filter

00:32:20.549 --> 00:32:26.960
stuff as it comes in and the way I rank stuff
is first I look at light, color and saturation

00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:32.830
and then I look at line, contrast and shape.
I see it all, but my filtering mechanism is

00:32:32.830 --> 00:32:33.830
different.

00:32:33.830 --> 00:32:38.350
I think the other 30 percent, there's some
gray area there. I think first they see line,

00:32:38.350 --> 00:32:44.720
contract and shape and then they see color,
saturation and light. Not better or worse,

00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:47.989
it's just a different filtering mechanism.

00:32:47.989 --> 00:32:53.519
And we all have our own experience of how
we view and how we categorize and chronicle

00:32:53.519 --> 00:33:02.279
the world. And, ah, um, this is maybe particular
to me, um, but I think we all have our own

00:33:02.279 --> 00:33:07.590
particular upbringing in the way we come to
know and see the world and record it. Um,

00:33:07.590 --> 00:33:13.960
mine might be a little unique in that, um,
I was born blind in one eye. I can only see

00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:21.259
out of my left eye. So I don't see in 3D.
I only see in 2D.

00:33:21.259 --> 00:33:26.040
And when you're born, you know, your eyes
are hooked into your brain just like your

00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:30.279
legs are hooked into your brain. Well your
legs, it takes a couple years to really know

00:33:30.279 --> 00:33:33.749
how to use 'em right, doesn't it? So what
makes you think that your eyes immediately

00:33:33.749 --> 00:33:38.810
know how to be used? It takes many, many years
of training and experience. So I came up with

00:33:38.810 --> 00:33:42.909
my own system for viewing the world. It's
not better or worse, it's just different.

00:33:42.909 --> 00:33:46.630
And I play sports and, you know I'm fully
functioning and all that sort of stuff, right?

00:33:46.630 --> 00:33:53.970
But, ah, when I play soccer I don't use parallax
like everybody else does. Um, I use the diameter

00:33:53.970 --> 00:33:57.610
of the ball to judge how far it is from my
body. And I notice that people when they're

00:33:57.610 --> 00:34:01.330
in the middle of a conversation with two eyes
they'll do subtle movements of their head

00:34:01.330 --> 00:34:05.919
just so that they can use parallax to know
where in z-space everybody is. 'Cause it's

00:34:05.919 --> 00:34:10.329
important, right for your brain. You know
for survival reasons, is this person a threat?

00:34:10.329 --> 00:34:14.119
Are they a mating opportunity? Do they have
food? What are their hands doing? You know

00:34:14.119 --> 00:34:16.889
you care about this stuff at a very base level.
Right?

00:34:16.889 --> 00:34:22.751
So I've just come up with my own system and
so it's been very easy for me to take photos.

00:34:22.751 --> 00:34:31.370
Ah, because when I look at a scene I immediately
compose it. Right? There's no, there's no

00:34:31.370 --> 00:34:36.049
struggle for me it's just very natural. Now
I think a lot of people who are probably photographers,

00:34:36.049 --> 00:34:39.520
you know, when something is composed, right,
it just feels right, it just feels like a

00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:44.040
beautiful composition. And that's, that's
one of the thrills we get isn't it? When we

00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:48.460
have a camera and we, we set up a scene and
we click and we just know when it's properly

00:34:48.460 --> 00:34:52.669
composed. It feels good. You're, what you're
doing is you're taking the entropy of the

00:34:52.669 --> 00:34:57.540
world and you're adding your own beautiful
interpretation of it. Right? You're taking

00:34:57.540 --> 00:35:01.940
this chaos and you're making order out of
it even if just temporarily. Right? That's

00:35:01.940 --> 00:35:06.990
why we can't stand to have forks kind of sideways,
you gotta make 'em right. We have this, this

00:35:06.990 --> 00:35:09.260
human need to fight against entropy.

00:35:09.260 --> 00:35:13.349
And I think that same things happens with
photography. It's such a chaotic place out

00:35:13.349 --> 00:35:17.130
there and if we can just bring a little bit
of reason and beauty to in a moment, it's

00:35:17.130 --> 00:35:18.130
wonderful.

00:35:18.130 --> 00:35:25.170
So there's this great thing called fie, it's
the golden ratio. Probably some of y'all have

00:35:25.170 --> 00:35:32.119
heard of it. It's know to mathematicians and
to architects and few trivial type things

00:35:32.119 --> 00:35:40.890
like that. But what happens is, is this magical
number 1.618 goes on kinda like pi and it

00:35:40.890 --> 00:35:48.500
was discovered by Fibonacci, this Italian
mathematician. The Fibonacci sequence is a

00:35:48.500 --> 00:35:53.059
new number is always the sum of the two previous
numbers. It goes one, two three and two plus

00:35:53.059 --> 00:35:58.069
three is five, and five plus three is eight,
eight plus five is thirteen, so on and so

00:35:58.069 --> 00:36:03.280
forth. Now if you divide the most recent number
by the number just before it, you get something

00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:08.710
close to 1.618. In fact, once you've gone
about thirteen numbers deep into a Fibonacci

00:36:08.710 --> 00:36:12.710
sequence, you get very, very close to 1.618.
Interesting that it's a prime number when

00:36:12.710 --> 00:36:19.040
it begins. And this number is the ratio of
beauty.

00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:23.780
You know when you look at something and it
just feels right. It just feels beautiful.

00:36:23.780 --> 00:36:30.020
That's because something has lined up along
this ratio of one to 1.618. If you look at

00:36:30.020 --> 00:36:35.460
the proportions of a face, of a body, of what
is perfect and what is beautiful, that is

00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:36.670
that 1.618.

00:36:36.670 --> 00:36:44.000
If you look at the way the petals, ah, flay
out in a, in a splay out of flower, that's

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:48.660
at that ratio. A conk shell. If you look at
great ancient old buildings, the Greek architects

00:36:48.660 --> 00:36:52.700
knew this, right?
So there is something magical about this number.

00:36:52.700 --> 00:36:58.240
And when you line up your photos, um, the
closer you can get to this magical point,

00:36:58.240 --> 00:37:02.010
the more it just feels right to the viewer.
Right? So a lot of times you can't explain,

00:37:02.010 --> 00:37:06.630
but there is math behind all this stuff. And
it feels right and it feels natural.

00:37:06.630 --> 00:37:10.640
Um, you know in photography school and in
books and whenever they talk about this thing

00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:16.470
the rule of third, I think that's sort of
a poor man's version of fie. Right? I think

00:37:16.470 --> 00:37:21.950
if you can start learning these fie points
and position your cropping around that, ah,

00:37:21.950 --> 00:37:25.560
eventually you won't have to crop, you'll
just get it right in the camera. But you can

00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:29.720
approach this point of just sort of natural
beauty. I think that makes sense.

00:37:29.720 --> 00:37:36.520
Um, I came about all of this photography through
sort of a back door. Um, I got my first camera

00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:41.109
only about three or four years ago. I've never
taken a photography class and never read a

00:37:41.109 --> 00:37:46.560
book. I don't know the right way to do anything.
I don't think there is a right way to do anything.

00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:53.210
Um, I think that the process is important
and the process should be one of guessing,

00:37:53.210 --> 00:37:57.920
trying, making a mistake and then forgiving
yourself and moving on.

00:37:57.920 --> 00:38:01.940
That's something we, it's hard for us to do
in a sort of a Western society is to forgive

00:38:01.940 --> 00:38:07.000
ourselves. We always put this, these guilt
trips on ourself which kind of holds us back,

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:12.420
right, and makes us afraid to experiment.
But you should get in the habit of guessing

00:38:12.420 --> 00:38:18.160
how someone does something, try it, mess up,
forgive yourself and move on and try not to

00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:22.089
do it again. This is the same process I do
with everything and it just seems to work

00:38:22.089 --> 00:38:26.000
out very, very well. I encourage people to
try that.

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:27.720
[pause]

00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:33.210
Um, you'll notice that, ah, um, one of the
problems commonly with HDR photography is

00:38:33.210 --> 00:38:40.440
something called ghosting. Okay. Ghosting
is when you take, um, multiple photos and

00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:44.760
some of these photos, um, are going to have
a, let's say a dog running across, right?

00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:47.750
And he'll be in three different positions
for the three different pictures and that's

00:38:47.750 --> 00:38:48.750
a problem, right?

00:38:48.750 --> 00:38:56.940
Well there's a few ways to get past that problem.
One way is to, when you take the original

00:38:56.940 --> 00:39:01.809
pictures, make them all in raw and pick the
one raw file where the dog is in the most

00:39:01.809 --> 00:39:06.140
interesting position and use that to make
the HDR. That's one method.

00:39:06.140 --> 00:39:12.849
Another method is to go ahead and, ah, allow
the ghosting and then bring that ghosted image

00:39:12.849 --> 00:39:19.930
into Photoshop as a top layer, bring one of
the original raws underneath, and then remix

00:39:19.930 --> 00:39:26.710
the two by masking through or erasing through
and putting in the proper dog. That's another

00:39:26.710 --> 00:39:27.920
way to do it.

00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:32.740
Um, there's, there's a few other little tricks
you can do, but those are the two big ways.

00:39:32.740 --> 00:39:37.430
A lot of time I leave ghosting, like in this
ocean shot. I left ghosting in the waves because

00:39:37.430 --> 00:39:43.069
I feel like it has a, an element of emotion.
Right? It seems to make sense that there's

00:39:43.069 --> 00:39:49.190
movement in water, and one with here in Boston.
It just feels right that there's some motion

00:39:49.190 --> 00:39:50.430
there.

00:39:50.430 --> 00:39:53.970
Um, I just finished this wonderful book. If
you're into impressionism and art or whatever,

00:39:53.970 --> 00:40:01.000
it's called, it's called The Judgment of Paris.
I heard it on audible. It's like this 16 hour

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:05.920
epic. And, ah, um, it talks all about what
the impressionists went through to get their

00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:09.859
art accepted by the French establishment.
They didn't have the Internet. The only way

00:40:09.859 --> 00:40:14.800
to get a photo shown was to be in the salon,
and to get into the salon you had to pass

00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:21.069
this committee of octogenarians, these old
masters who were just not ready to let this

00:40:21.069 --> 00:40:22.609
new school in.

00:40:22.609 --> 00:40:28.140
They thought the proper to make a painting
was to properly depict the heroic nature of

00:40:28.140 --> 00:40:35.849
man and to show Greek gods, to show French
generals, to show the, the amazing moral absolutism

00:40:35.849 --> 00:40:40.690
of mankind. Um, and so these impressionists
came along and they would actually use the

00:40:40.690 --> 00:40:43.859
new technology of the day. They could take
paints out into the field and paint the light

00:40:43.859 --> 00:40:49.920
exactly how they saw it. And, uh, it was very
off putting to old school.

00:40:49.920 --> 00:40:56.010
Um, so the reason I want to know all that
is say that, ah, ah, there's not really necessarily

00:40:56.010 --> 00:41:03.470
a right way to go about it, and when it comes
to ghosting it's okay to have some adjustment

00:41:03.470 --> 00:41:08.380
there. Let the viewer guess what's happening.

00:41:08.380 --> 00:41:12.250
Renoir said that no painting should be perfect.
There should be some mystery. There should

00:41:12.250 --> 00:41:16.410
be something you're not telling them. There
should be the impression of what is really

00:41:16.410 --> 00:41:17.410
happening.

00:41:17.410 --> 00:41:23.650
Um, the establishment back then, there was
a guy named Ernest Meissonier and he was the

00:41:23.650 --> 00:41:29.900
richest, most wealthy French painter of the
day. Very exacting, battle painting. And his

00:41:29.900 --> 00:41:37.140
magnum opus was this painting, Friedland.
It took him 10 years to make and he, he hated

00:41:37.140 --> 00:41:42.160
the impressionists because of their rough
sketches. And he was very exacting. And he

00:41:42.160 --> 00:41:47.510
was known for painting horses in their, in
all their glory. And so what he did, he was

00:41:47.510 --> 00:41:53.119
very wealthy, he had, he built, a, a railway
station in his house and he had a train on

00:41:53.119 --> 00:41:57.559
there. He had people push him along a train
by hand while one of his horses would run

00:41:57.559 --> 00:42:03.780
buy and he's sit there and sketch the exact
musculature of the horse. And so he displayed

00:42:03.780 --> 00:42:09.180
his painting at the salon after 10 years and
the critics were always on his side, and actually

00:42:09.180 --> 00:42:13.650
lambasted him because it was so exact, they
said it looked like the horse had been flayed

00:42:13.650 --> 00:42:17.510
of his skin.
Just then they were starting come around to

00:42:17.510 --> 00:42:21.710
the impressionists, because it gave them a
feeling of being there. And there's something

00:42:21.710 --> 00:42:27.160
more to art than being exact. There's something
magical about it.

00:42:27.160 --> 00:42:37.680
Um, my daughter, Isabella, I have three kids,
she's my middle child, she's four and she,

00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:44.470
ah, she has this wonderful, thin membrane
between what's real and what's not real. And

00:42:44.470 --> 00:42:49.440
if any of y'all have kids, you know exactly
what I mean. It helps you to realize the wonderful

00:42:49.440 --> 00:42:54.900
things the brain can do, and the bad things
it does to adults. And, you know, so I'm with

00:42:54.900 --> 00:42:57.990
my daughter, Isabella, I don't know where
she got this, but she got this idea that whenever

00:42:57.990 --> 00:43:03.789
we see Christmas lights around trees or on
a house, she goes "Tinkerbelle's been here."

00:43:03.789 --> 00:43:08.210
She gets really excited and so I start to
wonder does she really think that Tinkerbelle's

00:43:08.210 --> 00:43:12.589
been there or is she just tricking herself
and enjoying, or does she even take it to

00:43:12.589 --> 00:43:17.900
that level? And then I think but does it really
matter, you know. They surf between what's

00:43:17.900 --> 00:43:21.970
real and what's not real so easily and it's
wonderful.

00:43:21.970 --> 00:43:26.750
And I think actually grownups like to do that
too. But we're not allowed to, right, because

00:43:26.750 --> 00:43:31.160
we have to pay our taxes, buy stamps and make
sure there's coffee in the morning. And you

00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:34.610
know there's this left brain world that we're
stuck in and the only time we're allowed to

00:43:34.610 --> 00:43:39.500
escape is once a week when we go to the movie
theater in public. They lower the lights and

00:43:39.500 --> 00:43:43.470
we can escape into what's on the screen. That's
the only time it's publically acceptable to

00:43:43.470 --> 00:43:47.770
have a, a fanciful life. But I think we all
long for it because it feels right, doesn't

00:43:47.770 --> 00:43:48.770
it?

00:43:48.770 --> 00:43:52.569
I think finally the world is changing and
can be free. I think we all have this wonderful,

00:43:52.569 --> 00:43:56.410
artistic side that's waiting to come out.
But no one has told you it's okay to let it

00:43:56.410 --> 00:44:00.030
come out. I'm here to tell you it's perfectly
okay. It's natural.

00:44:00.030 --> 00:44:06.140
[pause]

00:44:06.140 --> 00:44:13.700
There's um, there's something happening interesting
on the Internet, I think. There's this idea

00:44:13.700 --> 00:44:20.069
of um, Dunbar's number. Maybe some of you
guys have heard of this. Um, I first came

00:44:20.069 --> 00:44:26.690
across it in Guns, Germs and Steel. I think
it's a Jared Diamond book. It's an anthropological

00:44:26.690 --> 00:44:28.140
concept.

00:44:28.140 --> 00:44:31.200
Um, by the way, I've got this great reading
list if you're interested in reading more

00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:36.690
about any of this stuff. Ah, in fact I've
got this, it's a reading list and a link list,

00:44:36.690 --> 00:44:40.570
a link to this Ted video of Jill Bolte Taylor
talking about the left and the right brain.

00:44:40.570 --> 00:44:45.580
She's actually this brain researcher that
had a, a stroke. Um, and she recorded the

00:44:45.580 --> 00:44:48.839
whole thing as it happened in her left brain.
It's very interesting. If there's any doubt

00:44:48.839 --> 00:44:52.420
in your mind that maybe left and right brain
in psycho babble, it's not. It's all very,

00:44:52.420 --> 00:44:53.420
very real.

00:44:53.420 --> 00:44:55.650
[pause]

00:44:55.650 --> 00:45:03.170
And so, um, ah, with Dunbar's number, ah,
there's a few texts I have on it in these

00:45:03.170 --> 00:45:09.470
various books. What is means is that we often
keep track of about 150 people or so. Okay.

00:45:09.470 --> 00:45:16.049
And it comes from our villager days, right?
When we kept track of our immediate family,

00:45:16.049 --> 00:45:20.770
our secondary family, the village elders,
the warriors, the medicine man, it's about

00:45:20.770 --> 00:45:25.670
150 people or so that you keep track of, right?
Men are very good at keeping track of direct

00:45:25.670 --> 00:45:30.410
relationships and that sort of thing. Women
are particularly good at keeping track of

00:45:30.410 --> 00:45:34.200
relationships of relationships; secondary
and tertiary, and they remember all this stuff.

00:45:34.200 --> 00:45:40.440
Right? And actually, the it, it's very important
for the cohesion to have women keeping track

00:45:40.440 --> 00:45:44.030
of who wrongs who and whatnot. That's why
they remember. That's why they don't forget.

00:45:44.030 --> 00:45:45.559
It's deep in them.

00:45:45.559 --> 00:45:49.720
And, ah, and now we don't live in villages
anymore, do we? We're all spread out all over

00:45:49.720 --> 00:45:55.920
creation in suburbia. But we still have to
keep track of about 150 people and our 150

00:45:55.920 --> 00:46:00.690
people has really gotten messed up. Um, by
the way, this is my own half-baked theory.

00:46:00.690 --> 00:46:06.069
But I think it makes sense. Maybe you guys
can bake the over half. And it is that, um,

00:46:06.069 --> 00:46:13.770
we do keep track of about 75 family members
and close friends, but the other 75 or people,

00:46:13.770 --> 00:46:18.789
75 people or so have been blasted into our
homes by Hollywood because that's our village

00:46:18.789 --> 00:46:23.309
now, right? We all kinda know that vaguely
who Brad Pitt is dating, right? Why? Right,

00:46:23.309 --> 00:46:26.319
why do we care? But we can't help but care.

00:46:26.319 --> 00:46:30.410
I used to get on planes and, you know, walk
through first class and very, very intelligent

00:46:30.410 --> 00:46:35.020
people were sitting there reading Us and People
and I think "what are they doing?" You know,

00:46:35.020 --> 00:46:38.630
these, are a, but they can't help it, they've
got to keep track of these people. They've

00:46:38.630 --> 00:46:43.680
got to keep track of, because celebrities
have accidentally become part of our Dunbar's

00:46:43.680 --> 00:46:44.859
150.

00:46:44.859 --> 00:46:50.010
I think now thanks to Twitter and the Internet
we're able to come up with a proper 150. Right?

00:46:50.010 --> 00:46:55.599
We're able to get rid of people like, um,
Elayne Boosler, right? Why is she in my 150?

00:46:55.599 --> 00:46:59.710
She doesn't need to be in my 150. I can get
rid of her and I can replace her with someone

00:46:59.710 --> 00:47:03.840
who has meaning in my life, maybe it's an
artist, maybe it's a poet. And I can follow

00:47:03.840 --> 00:47:08.520
them on Twitter and these sorts of tools.
I think that, I think we'll find that 150

00:47:08.520 --> 00:47:13.750
to 200 is about the magical number of people
to follow because that's what makes sense.

00:47:13.750 --> 00:47:16.309
That's what strikes us on a deep level.

00:47:16.309 --> 00:47:18.030
Um, this is in Yellowstone.

00:47:18.030 --> 00:47:21.441
By the way, if any of you guys have any questions
about any of these particular images we can

00:47:21.441 --> 00:47:22.510
do it in Q and A afterwards.

00:47:22.510 --> 00:47:29.210
Uh, this is Bangkok. It's called the bangs,
or the Veins of Bangkok.

00:47:29.210 --> 00:47:34.960
As I've traveled around, I've been, uh, been
lucky to meet other great, um, photographers

00:47:34.960 --> 00:47:41.520
and HDR photographers all over the world,
and we go out and we exchange ideas, we shoot

00:47:41.520 --> 00:47:47.110
all day, we post-process all night, and just
have a ball of it. And everyone does things

00:47:47.110 --> 00:47:51.569
a little bit different, so I've been able
to take their techniques and their successes

00:47:51.569 --> 00:47:55.650
and integrate them with my own, and come up
with something that's wonderfully, that's

00:47:55.650 --> 00:48:02.630
wonderfully unique, I think. It's different.
I wouldn't say that I do straight up HDR photography.

00:48:02.630 --> 00:48:09.130
I would say it kinda falls in that realm,
right? And there's a lot of old school photographers

00:48:09.130 --> 00:48:14.930
have, that have not yet crossed the Rubicon,
let's say, into the world of HDR. Maybe they've

00:48:14.930 --> 00:48:21.549
dipped a toe in. I think it's interesting.
Ah, but I think over time that they will see,

00:48:21.549 --> 00:48:27.470
as everyone will see, that this is not necessarily
"the" evolution of, of photography, but it

00:48:27.470 --> 00:48:35.099
is "a" evolution of photography. And if you
see the world like this, like I do, um, then

00:48:35.099 --> 00:48:37.940
it's a tremendous, ah, set of ah, tools to
add to your arsenal.

00:48:37.940 --> 00:48:43.549
You'll see that sometimes I really amped it
up and sometimes I'm not quite so amped up.

00:48:43.549 --> 00:48:46.809
It just depends on my mood and how artistic
I'm feeling or what song is playing while

00:48:46.809 --> 00:48:52.520
I'm editing these things. Um, it?s wonderful
kind of right brain experience. I edit these

00:48:52.520 --> 00:48:55.460
things at midnight after my kids go to sleep.

00:48:55.460 --> 00:48:59.760
This is Iceland. Iceland is a wonderful place
for HDR photography. We're used to these places

00:48:59.760 --> 00:49:03.390
in the US and have all these boardwalks and
whatnot, it's wild there.

00:49:03.390 --> 00:49:08.350
This is Hans Zimmer's studio. He's one of
my favorite artists. I was very lucky to use

00:49:08.350 --> 00:49:12.789
my, my network, my seven degrees of separation
to find out I was lucky and I was only one

00:49:12.789 --> 00:49:17.964
degree away from Hans Zimmer. So I got in
to his studio to shoot it. It's just wonderful.

00:49:17.964 --> 00:49:19.150
This is Seoul, Korea.

00:49:19.150 --> 00:49:25.030
It's great to take night shots with HDR photography
because it's not as simple as just leaving

00:49:25.030 --> 00:49:30.490
the shutter open and letting light come in.
You use all kinds of light levels there that

00:49:30.490 --> 00:49:34.220
you don't really know that you have access
to.

00:49:34.220 --> 00:49:43.569
Um, when it comes to different ways of, of
thinking about light, um, I recommend, ah,

00:49:43.569 --> 00:49:50.619
among other books, um, there's some great
works by Richard Feynman. Ah, one of his favorite

00:49:50.619 --> 00:49:56.029
books that I've read is called The Pleasure
of Finding Things Out. And it's a different

00:49:56.029 --> 00:50:01.440
way to think about the world, right? It's
actually a collection of his essays that all

00:50:01.440 --> 00:50:08.089
kind of revolve around this central topic
of ways to think about thinking. And a lot

00:50:08.089 --> 00:50:14.130
of it involves the idea of not worrying so
much about the names of things and how other

00:50:14.130 --> 00:50:20.809
people have a, a common lexicon for stuff.
It is, it is how they think, how they behave,

00:50:20.809 --> 00:50:25.380
how they act and what they do that matters,
rather than what they're called.

00:50:25.380 --> 00:50:32.010
So I don't get caught up in a lot of this
kind of stuff about how do you, um, how to

00:50:32.010 --> 00:50:38.160
you talk about certain subject? I just let
it flow. Right? And I get some flack sometimes

00:50:38.160 --> 00:50:45.460
from photographers who just want to know the
hardcore technology of how it happens. Right?

00:50:45.460 --> 00:50:50.400
They want to know, they wanna discuss optics
and some of the particular things about - I,

00:50:50.400 --> 00:50:57.250
I'm much more into the whole experience of
it. And not until you really let go; and what

00:50:57.250 --> 00:51:01.030
you need to do is understand the technology,
the basics of it with your left brain, but

00:51:01.030 --> 00:51:05.050
then let your right brain kind of execute
on it. That's what makes sense to me.

00:51:05.050 --> 00:51:11.760
So these things that Feynman discusses, he,
leads into all kinds of various areas like,

00:51:11.760 --> 00:51:19.819
so much of human conversation is this, is
this uh, act of, ah, getting one perspective

00:51:19.819 --> 00:51:23.829
to mesh with another perspective. You spend
so much time trying to explain yourself to

00:51:23.829 --> 00:51:28.359
someone else, they have to take all your words
and rearrange them to their own world view.

00:51:28.359 --> 00:51:33.170
And it's the same idea as colors, right? Maybe
my red is not your red. It's not just red,

00:51:33.170 --> 00:51:37.390
but it's every other word of the human language
we've come to know. And you come up with your

00:51:37.390 --> 00:51:42.900
own internal system for this. That's all fine
and well, and that's exciting, but we should

00:51:42.900 --> 00:51:47.339
let go of that stuff and just let it flow.
It's a very, very difficult concept to get

00:51:47.339 --> 00:51:51.250
your head around. Once it happens, it becomes
very natural, very easy.

00:51:51.250 --> 00:51:56.840
Do you see those two people right at the very
top? Tiny. That's a huge thing called the

00:51:56.840 --> 00:52:01.770
Grand Prismatic. I found that one also on
Google Earth. There's this boardwalk that

00:52:01.770 --> 00:52:06.369
everybody else goes down. I didn't wanna go
down. I don't like all these tourists around.

00:52:06.369 --> 00:52:12.010
So I like to go up; and we climbed up this
mountain and shot down at the Grand Prismatic.

00:52:12.010 --> 00:52:13.680
So I'll leave you with these final images.

00:52:13.680 --> 00:52:18.730
Um, this is Argentina. I woke up one morning;
my sleeping bag was covered in snow; after

00:52:18.730 --> 00:52:24.180
I had vacated the tent I was sick of Uri.
Um, walked around the forest just as the snow

00:52:24.180 --> 00:52:28.010
was penetrating the autumn leaves. It was
just gorgeous ? this magical experience. We

00:52:28.010 --> 00:52:31.490
made it out into the plains. Saw this beautiful
landscape.

00:52:31.490 --> 00:52:37.020
It really is a beautiful world out there.
I encourage you all to go out there. Accept

00:52:37.020 --> 00:52:42.119
it and feel it and capture it in your own
way. I think that is a wonderful way to live

00:52:42.119 --> 00:52:43.369
your own adventure.

00:52:43.369 --> 00:52:49.430
I wanna leave you with this thought that:
the left brain is for getting through life

00:52:49.430 --> 00:52:52.119
and the right brain is for living.

00:52:52.119 --> 00:52:53.119
Thank you very much.

00:52:53.119 --> 00:52:55.589
[applause]

00:52:55.589 --> 00:53:04.359
&gt;&gt;Trey Ratcliff: So any questions? How long
do we have, timekeeper?

00:53:04.359 --> 00:53:06.859
[unintelligible voice in background]

00:53:06.859 --> 00:53:07.970
Ten minutes. Alright.

00:53:07.970 --> 00:53:12.920
[pause]

00:53:12.920 --> 00:53:13.920
Yes, sir.

00:53:13.920 --> 00:53:22.350
&gt;&gt;So photographers have been doing dodging
and burning for at least a century and ah,

00:53:22.350 --> 00:53:31.410
is HDR qualitatively different from that or,
eh, is it just a way of automating it, eh

00:53:31.410 --> 00:53:37.049
&gt;&gt;Trey Ratcliff: That's good question. So
is it that different than dodging and burning?

00:53:37.049 --> 00:53:44.980
Well, I guess in one instance it's not. Um,
dodging and burning almost takes on the idea

00:53:44.980 --> 00:53:49.910
of painting on the picture to me. Right? Because
you do have to go on with a brush and dodge

00:53:49.910 --> 00:53:55.730
one area and burn another. Ah, for the uninitiated
dodging is lightening an area and burning

00:53:55.730 --> 00:54:00.789
is darkening an area. Dodging and burning
work to a certain degree and they will generally

00:54:00.789 --> 00:54:06.390
lighten and darken an area, but it doesn't
necessary go through the entire tonal range

00:54:06.390 --> 00:54:10.849
that the other exposures have captured. And
maybe one of the exposures had captured a

00:54:10.849 --> 00:54:17.140
different tone of blue that you're unable
to dodge to. Now, also, another problem with

00:54:17.140 --> 00:54:20.849
dodging and burning is it takes a long time
and requires a lot of meticulousness, especially

00:54:20.849 --> 00:54:26.030
with today's photos at 12 megapixel or 24
megapixels. If you're gonna get in and dodge

00:54:26.030 --> 00:54:32.760
and burn on a very small level it would take
an eternity. This does through these HDR algorithms,

00:54:32.760 --> 00:54:37.380
goes through a pixel by pixel level and does
most of that work for you based on certain

00:54:37.380 --> 00:54:42.291
settings. So I think it's easier, it's much
more, a little more batch way of doing it.

00:54:42.291 --> 00:54:45.049
Does that make sense?

00:54:45.049 --> 00:54:46.049
[pause]

00:54:46.049 --> 00:54:47.130
Yes, sir.

00:54:47.130 --> 00:54:52.170
&gt;&gt;Ah, I have a question regarding the reproduction
of these HDR pictures.

00:54:52.170 --> 00:54:53.170
&gt;&gt;Trey Ratcliff: Um, hum.

00:54:53.170 --> 00:54:58.160
&gt;&gt;Because, ah, the camera with the multiple
exposures can capture very high dynamic range,

00:54:58.160 --> 00:55:04.310
but when you reproduce them on screen like
here, you're limited to 100 to one contract

00:55:04.310 --> 00:55:05.310
ratio.

00:55:05.310 --> 00:55:06.310
&gt;&gt;Trey Ratcliff: That's right.

00:55:06.310 --> 00:55:11.599
&gt;&gt;So I was wondering if, ah, maybe are other
media that reproduce these images better like

00:55:11.599 --> 00:55:12.769
high dynamic range monitors.

00:55:12.769 --> 00:55:18.549
&gt;&gt;Trey Ratcliff: That's a good question. There
are a few, ah, techno files that do foresee

00:55:18.549 --> 00:55:25.210
a future of HDR monitors. I don't, I don't
think HDR monitors will every catch on. Ah,

00:55:25.210 --> 00:55:29.480
for a number of reasons: one, there's not
enough HDR content to warrant such an expensive

00:55:29.480 --> 00:55:33.180
device, especially in small quantities would
be extremely expensive, even though it might

00:55:33.180 --> 00:55:37.400
actually be a better viewing experience, I
don't think they'll ever catch on.

00:55:37.400 --> 00:55:43.019
And second, these, this tone mapping that
I'm doing, where it's displayed on a screen,

00:55:43.019 --> 00:55:47.870
it's actually good enough. Right? It, it looks
so pretty and so nice that you don't feel

00:55:47.870 --> 00:55:53.970
like you need a better monitor to see it because
it already feels good enough. I, I am not

00:55:53.970 --> 00:55:58.630
the biggest expert in the world on display
technologies, but I, I do kind of feel the

00:55:58.630 --> 00:56:03.990
same about regular DVD and Blue Ray DVD. I
think the average person can't see that much

00:56:03.990 --> 00:56:07.940
different so that there's not that much impetus
to dump everything old and go the new way.

00:56:07.940 --> 00:56:13.240
Especially when it comes to something as expensive
as what will inevitably be an HDR display

00:56:13.240 --> 00:56:18.010
which, which are gonna be extremely expensive,
um, you know, who knows which way the future's

00:56:18.010 --> 00:56:23.769
gonna go? Um, but in my opinion, this is,
this is good enough. Now there's viewing issue

00:56:23.769 --> 00:56:28.789
that with HDR photography ? I believe the
screen has to be big enough so that your eye

00:56:28.789 --> 00:56:33.650
actually travels around, right? Because if
all that light hits you at the same time,

00:56:33.650 --> 00:56:39.029
your brain might reject it as too much. If
you can actually physically make the eye biologically

00:56:39.029 --> 00:56:43.369
move around and take in different light and
build that patchwork quilt just like it does

00:56:43.369 --> 00:56:46.950
on the scene, it makes it much easier for
the brain to accept it.

00:56:46.950 --> 00:56:52.069
&gt;&gt;I see. So for mixed illuminate scenes, do
you compensate for the different illuminates

00:56:52.069 --> 00:56:57.730
to remove the color casts? Because, for instance,
when I'm indoors and I look outside, I might

00:56:57.730 --> 00:57:02.619
have some incandescent light indoors which
is like very yellow, but the outside is bluish

00:57:02.619 --> 00:57:07.320
because of the sky. So if I just leave the
image like this it will have a very pronounced

00:57:07.320 --> 00:57:10.069
color cast that creates a bit of attention
 . . .

00:57:10.069 --> 00:57:11.069
&gt;&gt;Trey Ratcliff: Right.

00:57:11.069 --> 00:57:12.620
&gt;&gt;. . .which I not what the eye sees.

00:57:12.620 --> 00:57:18.569
&gt;&gt;Trey Ratcliff: Right. Well, ah, that gets
very tricky, right, because your, your camera

00:57:18.569 --> 00:57:25.089
is capturing whatever light is there and,
um, as we saw in some of those example, what

00:57:25.089 --> 00:57:29.670
light really is there, what is light and dark,
what the brown, what are all these colors?

00:57:29.670 --> 00:57:34.570
So what I've learned to do, is when I'm there
on the scene, I remember it as best I can.

00:57:34.570 --> 00:57:40.789
I remember the feelings of the colors and
I kind of equate the sounds and smells and

00:57:40.789 --> 00:57:45.630
somewhat of a synesthetic fusion and then
I try to bring that back later when I'm editing

00:57:45.630 --> 00:57:51.319
the photos to make sure that the greens and
browns and blues make sense. I think that

00:57:51.319 --> 00:57:58.049
there is this sort of golden ratio of, of
line and shape in the photo, but I also feel

00:57:58.049 --> 00:58:03.329
like there's something there with the colors.
At some point if you jamb the colors one way

00:58:03.329 --> 00:58:08.660
to far, you lose that beautiful translation
in tone mapping between the two.

00:58:08.660 --> 00:58:11.279
I think this is something that comes with
time and practice.

00:58:11.279 --> 00:58:14.580
&gt;&gt;So color processing is part of your post
processing?

00:58:14.580 --> 00:58:19.960
&gt;&gt;Trey Ratcliff: I do, I do a bit of color
processing, but mostly it's how intense do

00:58:19.960 --> 00:58:25.710
I wanna make one color or another. I don't
go through and paint on top of these items.

00:58:25.710 --> 00:58:31.599
Now you did see some of these have a texture
overlay. I have a textures tutorial on the

00:58:31.599 --> 00:58:35.720
website. That one isn't free. Um, but sometimes
when a photo comes out too boring and I want

00:58:35.720 --> 00:58:39.490
to give it a little bit of panache or something,
I'll put one of these textures or multiple

00:58:39.490 --> 00:58:43.450
textures over it to give it a big of feeling.
That's only time that I really dramatically

00:58:43.450 --> 00:58:49.589
adjust the color of something. But I, I uh,
I actually, whenever I go in and I change

00:58:49.589 --> 00:58:54.410
the, the white point, ah, or I change, ah,
something, it, it dramatically changes the

00:58:54.410 --> 00:58:57.880
colors. And either it feels right or it doesn't
feel right. I just move it around until it

00:58:57.880 --> 00:58:58.880
feels right.

00:58:58.880 --> 00:58:59.880
&gt;&gt;I see.

00:58:59.880 --> 00:59:02.341
&gt;&gt;Trey Ratcliff: It's not the most scientific
answer, but it's the best I can do.

00:59:02.341 --> 00:59:04.190
&gt;&gt;Thank you very much.

00:59:04.190 --> 00:59:05.589
&gt;&gt;Trey Ratcliff: Sure.

00:59:05.589 --> 00:59:06.589
[pause]

00:59:06.589 --> 00:59:12.119
&gt;&gt;Trey Ratcliff: If there are no other questions,
ah, you guys can always send me Tweets. I

00:59:12.119 --> 00:59:16.430
do my best to answer to all Tweets. If you
have questions about the book or about the

00:59:16.430 --> 00:59:20.131
processing or on your own journey through
this stuff. I can't answer everybody. I'm

00:59:20.131 --> 00:59:25.990
a little bit covered up, but I'll do my best
and again thank you guys for your time.

00:59:25.990 --> 00:59:29.089
[applause and talking]
