everything we've done with polynomials

00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:02.429
everything we've done with polynomials
 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:03.919
everything we've done with polynomials
so far has been either adding or

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:03.929
so far has been either adding or
 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:06.050
so far has been either adding or
multiplying them but what if we wanted

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060
multiplying them but what if we wanted
 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:07.460
multiplying them but what if we wanted
to go the other way what if we actually

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470
to go the other way what if we actually
 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.190
to go the other way what if we actually
wanted to factor a polynomial let me

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200
wanted to factor a polynomial let me
 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.240
wanted to factor a polynomial let me
show you what I mean

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250
show you what I mean
 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.600
show you what I mean
so let's say have the polynomial 3x to

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610
so let's say have the polynomial 3x to
 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.170
so let's say have the polynomial 3x to
the third power minus 21x

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180
the third power minus 21x
 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.300
the third power minus 21x
when I say factor it I essentially want

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310
when I say factor it I essentially want
 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.509
when I say factor it I essentially want
to break it up into the product of maybe

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519
to break it up into the product of maybe
 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.029
to break it up into the product of maybe
polynomials it could be a monomial which

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039
polynomials it could be a monomial which
 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.460
polynomials it could be a monomial which
is just one term and to do that over

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470
is just one term and to do that over
 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.290
is just one term and to do that over
here let's see we could factor out we

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300
here let's see we could factor out we
 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.359
here let's see we could factor out we
could factor out a 3x here so if you

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369
could factor out a 3x here so if you
 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.350
could factor out a 3x here so if you
factor out a 3x this is equal to 3x

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360
factor out a 3x this is equal to 3x
 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.160
factor out a 3x this is equal to 3x
times what's 3 X to the third divided by

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170
times what's 3 X to the third divided by
 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.190
times what's 3 X to the third divided by
3x this is let me write it this way

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200
3x this is let me write it this way
 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.290
3x this is let me write it this way
actually this is the same thing as 3x

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:47.300
actually this is the same thing as 3x
 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:53.029
actually this is the same thing as 3x
times 1 over 3x times the 3 X to the

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039
times 1 over 3x times the 3 X to the
 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.590
times 1 over 3x times the 3 X to the
third minus 21x notice 3x times 1 over

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600
third minus 21x notice 3x times 1 over
 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.599
third minus 21x notice 3x times 1 over
3x I'm not changing the number this is

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609
3x I'm not changing the number this is
 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.599
3x I'm not changing the number this is
3x over 3x this is 1 but the reason why

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609
3x over 3x this is 1 but the reason why
 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.939
3x over 3x this is 1 but the reason why
I picked 3x is because I saw that both

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949
I picked 3x is because I saw that both
 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.370
I picked 3x is because I saw that both
of these terms are divisible by 3x and

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380
of these terms are divisible by 3x and
 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.480
of these terms are divisible by 3x and
you're going to see that when I just

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490
you're going to see that when I just
 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.600
you're going to see that when I just
when I divide both of them by 3x so this

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610
when I divide both of them by 3x so this
 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.390
when I divide both of them by 3x so this
is going to be the same thing as 3x

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:13.400
is going to be the same thing as 3x
 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:20.410
is going to be the same thing as 3x
times 3x to the third over 3x minus 21x

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420
times 3x to the third over 3x minus 21x
 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.749
times 3x to the third over 3x minus 21x
over 3x and now this is going to be

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759
over 3x and now this is going to be
 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.420
over 3x and now this is going to be
equal to 3x what's this first term equal

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430
equal to 3x what's this first term equal
 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.999
equal to 3x what's this first term equal
to the 3s cancel out X to the third

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009
to the 3s cancel out X to the third
 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.940
to the 3s cancel out X to the third
divided by X we learned in our exponent

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950
divided by X we learned in our exponent
 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.319
divided by X we learned in our exponent
rules you could just subtract the

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329
rules you could just subtract the
 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.539
rules you could just subtract the
exponents there that's x times X times X

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549
exponents there that's x times X times X
 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.429
exponents there that's x times X times X
divided by X it's just going to be x

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439
divided by X it's just going to be x
 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.249
divided by X it's just going to be x
times X or just x squared so it's going

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259
times X or just x squared so it's going
 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.359
times X or just x squared so it's going
to be this first term here is just going

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369
to be this first term here is just going
 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.200
to be this first term here is just going
to be an x squared and then the X is

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210
to be an x squared and then the X is
 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.810
to be an x squared and then the X is
canceled out here 21 divided by 3 is 7 x

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820
canceled out here 21 divided by 3 is 7 x
 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.319
canceled out here 21 divided by 3 is 7 x
squared minus 7 and if you multiply them

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329
squared minus 7 and if you multiply them
 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:55.520
squared minus 7 and if you multiply them
out you're going to see you're going to

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530
out you're going to see you're going to
 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.889
out you're going to see you're going to
get 3 X to the third minus 21 X now I

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899
get 3 X to the third minus 21 X now I
 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.420
get 3 X to the third minus 21 X now I
went through all of these steps really

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430
went through all of these steps really
 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.010
went through all of these steps really
just to show you exactly what I'm doing

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020
just to show you exactly what I'm doing
 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.230
just to show you exactly what I'm doing
but as we progress you're going to see

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240
but as we progress you're going to see
 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.090
but as we progress you're going to see
that you can your brain will just

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100
that you can your brain will just
 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.740
that you can your brain will just
automatically say hey both of these are

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750
automatically say hey both of these are
 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.350
automatically say hey both of these are
divisible by 3 X let me factor out a 3x

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360
divisible by 3 X let me factor out a 3x
 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.420
divisible by 3 X let me factor out a 3x
and then divide both of these terms by 3

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430
and then divide both of these terms by 3
 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.660
and then divide both of these terms by 3
X to get x squared

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670
X to get x squared
 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.260
X to get x squared
- seven let's do another one let's say

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270
- seven let's do another one let's say
 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:22.400
- seven let's do another one let's say
we had 4x to the 3rd + 10 x squared

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410
we had 4x to the 3rd + 10 x squared
 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.890
we had 4x to the 3rd + 10 x squared
minus 2x so when I look at this

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900
minus 2x so when I look at this
 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.870
minus 2x so when I look at this
immediately what pops out is that all of

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880
immediately what pops out is that all of
 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.870
immediately what pops out is that all of
these terms are divisible by 2 and all

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880
these terms are divisible by 2 and all
 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.690
these terms are divisible by 2 and all
of them are divisible by X so let me

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700
of them are divisible by X so let me
 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.220
of them are divisible by X so let me
factor out a 2x so this is equal to 2x

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230
factor out a 2x so this is equal to 2x
 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.310
factor out a 2x so this is equal to 2x
times and when we factor out a 2x let's

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:41.320
times and when we factor out a 2x let's
 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.740
times and when we factor out a 2x let's
divide each of these terms by 2x 4x

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750
divide each of these terms by 2x 4x
 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.970
divide each of these terms by 2x 4x
third divided by 2x 4 divided by 2 is 2

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980
third divided by 2x 4 divided by 2 is 2
 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.870
third divided by 2x 4 divided by 2 is 2
and then X third divided by X is x

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880
and then X third divided by X is x
 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.290
and then X third divided by X is x
squared and then we have plus 10x

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300
squared and then we have plus 10x
 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.740
squared and then we have plus 10x
squared divided by 10 by 2x 10 divided

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750
squared divided by 10 by 2x 10 divided
 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:03.500
squared divided by 10 by 2x 10 divided
by 2 is 5 x squared divided by X is X

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510
by 2 is 5 x squared divided by X is X
 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.830
by 2 is 5 x squared divided by X is X
and then finally negative 2x divided by

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840
and then finally negative 2x divided by
 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.920
and then finally negative 2x divided by
2x is just negative 1 and if you want to

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930
2x is just negative 1 and if you want to
 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:11.850
2x is just negative 1 and if you want to
you know if you don't believe me just

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860
you know if you don't believe me just
 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.130
you know if you don't believe me just
multiply this out distribute the 2x and

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140
multiply this out distribute the 2x and
 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.500
multiply this out distribute the 2x and
you will get exactly this all we see we

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510
you will get exactly this all we see we
 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:17.729
you will get exactly this all we see we
try to look for something that's

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739
try to look for something that's
 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:20.400
try to look for something that's
divisible into every term we factor it

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410
divisible into every term we factor it
 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:22.380
divisible into every term we factor it
out factoring it out we put it outside

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:22.390
out factoring it out we put it outside
 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:24.990
out factoring it out we put it outside
of a parenthesis so to speak and then we

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000
of a parenthesis so to speak and then we
 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.210
of a parenthesis so to speak and then we
divide each of those terms by that

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220
divide each of those terms by that
 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.610
divide each of those terms by that
factor and we did that explicitly up

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620
factor and we did that explicitly up
 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.970
factor and we did that explicitly up
here now you're probably saying hey Sal

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980
here now you're probably saying hey Sal
 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.729
here now you're probably saying hey Sal
why are even we even worried about doing

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:35.739
why are even we even worried about doing
 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:37.770
why are even we even worried about doing
this and the answer is is it really

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780
this and the answer is is it really
 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.940
this and the answer is is it really
helps us solve a lot of certain types of

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950
helps us solve a lot of certain types of
 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:44.940
helps us solve a lot of certain types of
polynomial equations let me show you let

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950
polynomial equations let me show you let
 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:47.430
polynomial equations let me show you let
me show you what I mean let's say we

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440
me show you what I mean let's say we
 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.660
me show you what I mean let's say we
have the polynomial equation 9x squared

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670
have the polynomial equation 9x squared
 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:55.830
have the polynomial equation 9x squared
is equal to 27 X and we want to make

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840
is equal to 27 X and we want to make
 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.600
is equal to 27 X and we want to make
sure that we get all of the X's that

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:57.610
sure that we get all of the X's that
 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:00.630
sure that we get all of the X's that
satisfy this equation so let me subtract

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:00.640
satisfy this equation so let me subtract

is divided by divisible by 9 so is 9 and
 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.100
is divided by divisible by 9 so is 9 and
then both divisible by X so let's factor

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.110
then both divisible by X so let's factor
 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:40.529
then both divisible by X so let's factor
out let's factor out a 9 X so 9x squared

00:04:40.529 --> 00:04:40.539
out let's factor out a 9 X so 9x squared
 

00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:47.010
out let's factor out a 9 X so 9x squared
divided by 9x is just an X and then 27 X

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:47.020
divided by 9x is just an X and then 27 X
 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:51.119
divided by 9x is just an X and then 27 X
divided by 9x that's 27 negative 27 over

00:04:51.119 --> 00:04:51.129
divided by 9x that's 27 negative 27 over
 

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:53.670
divided by 9x that's 27 negative 27 over
9 is negative 3 and then the X divided

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680
9 is negative 3 and then the X divided
 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.939
9 is negative 3 and then the X divided
by X is just a 1 so this is 9x times X

00:04:56.939 --> 00:04:56.949
by X is just a 1 so this is 9x times X
 

00:04:56.949 --> 00:04:59.430
by X is just a 1 so this is 9x times X
minus 3 you can multiply it out to

00:04:59.430 --> 00:04:59.440
minus 3 you can multiply it out to
 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:01.020
minus 3 you can multiply it out to

two numbers and I say they're equal to 0
 

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:11.999
two numbers and I say they're equal to 0
let me do a little aside here if I were

00:05:11.999 --> 00:05:12.009
let me do a little aside here if I were
 

00:05:12.009 --> 00:05:14.640
let me do a little aside here if I were
to tell you that a times B is equal to 0

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:14.650
to tell you that a times B is equal to 0
 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:17.249
to tell you that a times B is equal to 0
what does that tell us that tells us

00:05:17.249 --> 00:05:17.259
what does that tell us that tells us
 

00:05:17.259 --> 00:05:26.279
what does that tell us that tells us
that either A or B or both are 0 at

00:05:26.279 --> 00:05:26.289
that either A or B or both are 0 at
 

00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:28.200

least one of these two have to be 0

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:28.210
least one of these two have to be 0
 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:29.879
least one of these two have to be 0
maybe both of them are going to be equal

00:05:29.879 --> 00:05:29.889
maybe both of them are going to be equal
 

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:32.159
maybe both of them are going to be equal
to 0 so we're doing the exact same thing

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:32.169
to 0 so we're doing the exact same thing
 

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:33.510
to 0 so we're doing the exact same thing
here we're taking the product you could

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:33.520
here we're taking the product you could
 

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.670
here we're taking the product you could
view that as a you could view that as B

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:35.680
view that as a you could view that as B
 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:37.080
view that as a you could view that as B
we're taking the product of two numbers

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:37.090
we're taking the product of two numbers
 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:39.420
we're taking the product of two numbers
and saying that that product is equal to

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:39.430
and saying that that product is equal to
 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:42.959
and saying that that product is equal to
0 so that tells us that either 9x is

00:05:42.959 --> 00:05:42.969
0 so that tells us that either 9x is
 

00:05:42.969 --> 00:05:47.969
0 so that tells us that either 9x is
going to be equal to 0 or X minus 3 is

00:05:47.969 --> 00:05:47.979
going to be equal to 0 or X minus 3 is
 

00:05:47.979 --> 00:05:50.610
going to be equal to 0 or X minus 3 is
going to be equal to 0 either of these

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:50.620
going to be equal to 0 either of these
 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:52.649
going to be equal to 0 either of these
or both of these are going to equal to 0

00:05:52.649 --> 00:05:52.659
or both of these are going to equal to 0
 

00:05:52.659 --> 00:05:55.110
or both of these are going to equal to 0
this we know how to solve divide both

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:55.120
this we know how to solve divide both
 

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:59.430
this we know how to solve divide both
sides by 9 you get X is equal to 0 this

00:05:59.430 --> 00:05:59.440
sides by 9 you get X is equal to 0 this
 

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:01.559
sides by 9 you get X is equal to 0 this
we know how to solve add 3 to both sides

00:06:01.559 --> 00:06:01.569
we know how to solve add 3 to both sides
 

00:06:01.569 --> 00:06:05.159
we know how to solve add 3 to both sides
add 3 to both sides and you're left with

00:06:05.159 --> 00:06:05.169
add 3 to both sides and you're left with
 

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:08.519
add 3 to both sides and you're left with
X because these cancel out is equal to 3

00:06:08.519 --> 00:06:08.529
X because these cancel out is equal to 3
 

00:06:08.529 --> 00:06:11.129
X because these cancel out is equal to 3
so this equation here actually had two

00:06:11.129 --> 00:06:11.139
so this equation here actually had two
 

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:13.230
so this equation here actually had two
solutions X could be 0 and you can

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:13.240
solutions X could be 0 and you can
 

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:16.350

verify that 0 is equal to 0 or X could

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:16.360
verify that 0 is equal to 0 or X could
 

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:18.839
verify that 0 is equal to 0 or X could
be equal to 3 9 times 9 is the same

00:06:18.839 --> 00:06:18.849
be equal to 3 9 times 9 is the same
 

00:06:18.849 --> 00:06:22.589
be equal to 3 9 times 9 is the same
thing as 27 times 3 and you might have

00:06:22.589 --> 00:06:22.599
thing as 27 times 3 and you might have
 

00:06:22.599 --> 00:06:23.579
thing as 27 times 3 and you might have
been able to figure that out in your

00:06:23.579 --> 00:06:23.589
been able to figure that out in your
 

00:06:23.589 --> 00:06:24.719
been able to figure that out in your
head but when you do it this way you

00:06:24.719 --> 00:06:24.729
head but when you do it this way you
 

00:06:24.729 --> 00:06:26.790
head but when you do it this way you
make sure that you get all of the

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:26.800
make sure that you get all of the

more like this let's say I had 4a

00:06:34.129 --> 00:06:34.139
more like this let's say I had 4a
 

00:06:34.139 --> 00:06:39.059
more like this let's say I had 4a
squared plus a is equal to 0 once again

00:06:39.059 --> 00:06:39.069
squared plus a is equal to 0 once again
 

00:06:39.069 --> 00:06:39.970
squared plus a is equal to 0 once again
we can factor it

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:39.980
we can factor it
 

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:41.440
we can factor it
a out both of these terms are divisible

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:41.450
a out both of these terms are divisible
 

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:43.150
a out both of these terms are divisible
by a so this is the same thing as a

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:43.160
by a so this is the same thing as a
 

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:48.040
by a so this is the same thing as a
times for a plus one right I'm going to

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:48.050
times for a plus one right I'm going to
 

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:49.900
times for a plus one right I'm going to
factor an a out I took the a out of the

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:49.910
factor an a out I took the a out of the
 

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:51.490
factor an a out I took the a out of the
parentheses and then I divide each of

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:51.500
parentheses and then I divide each of
 

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:54.880
parentheses and then I divide each of
these terms by a and that's going to be

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:54.890
these terms by a and that's going to be
 

00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:57.250
these terms by a and that's going to be
equal to zero so that means either a is

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:57.260
equal to zero so that means either a is
 

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:01.210
equal to zero so that means either a is
equal to zero or for a plus one is equal

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:01.220
equal to zero or for a plus one is equal
 

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:04.270
equal to zero or for a plus one is equal
to zero well that's one solution right

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:04.280
to zero well that's one solution right
 

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:06.670
to zero well that's one solution right
from the get-go and this one right here

00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:06.680
from the get-go and this one right here
 

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:08.590
from the get-go and this one right here
we could subtract one from both sides we

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:08.600
we could subtract one from both sides we
 

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:10.960
we could subtract one from both sides we
get four a is equal to negative one and

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:10.970
get four a is equal to negative one and
 

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:13.000
get four a is equal to negative one and
then you could divide both sides by four

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:13.010
then you could divide both sides by four
 

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:15.670
then you could divide both sides by four
and we get a is equal to negative one

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:15.680
and we get a is equal to negative one
 

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:18.760
and we get a is equal to negative one
over four now I said that was the last

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:18.770
over four now I said that was the last
 

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:20.620
over four now I said that was the last

a C I'm multiplying them and they're

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:18.530
a C I'm multiplying them and they're
 

00:08:18.530 --> 00:08:20.650
a C I'm multiplying them and they're
equal to zero so that means that either

00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:20.660
equal to zero so that means that either
 

00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:25.870
equal to zero so that means that either
X minus 5 is equal to 0 or 2x plus 7 is

00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:25.880
X minus 5 is equal to 0 or 2x plus 7 is
 

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:30.970

and we can solve each of these

00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:32.030
and we can solve each of these
 

00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:34.659
and we can solve each of these
independently add 5 to both sides of

00:08:34.659 --> 00:08:34.669
independently add 5 to both sides of
 

00:08:34.669 --> 00:08:36.310
independently add 5 to both sides of
this equation and you get X is equal to

00:08:36.310 --> 00:08:36.320
this equation and you get X is equal to
 

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:39.490
this equation and you get X is equal to
5 so that's one solution to this

00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:39.500

sides you get 2x is equal to negative 7

00:08:46.210 --> 00:08:46.220
sides you get 2x is equal to negative 7
 

00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:48.790
sides you get 2x is equal to negative 7
divide both sides by 2 you get X is

00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:48.800
divide both sides by 2 you get X is
 

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:52.030
divide both sides by 2 you get X is
equal to negative 7 over 2 that's

00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:52.040
equal to negative 7 over 2 that's
 

00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:53.260
equal to negative 7 over 2 that's
