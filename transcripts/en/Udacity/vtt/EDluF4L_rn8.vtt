00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.080
So just the nomenclature that
we're going to use here, and

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:05.900
this is taken directly
from the rosetal paper.

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:07.000
We have a couple things.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.050
First of all, there's the actual state,
and they use L for

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.740
location, but L is not,
maybe not just be the position.

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.620
It might also be the scale,
rotation, etc.

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:20.070
And then they've got an observation
that's called F, and

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.890
you know why it's called F?

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.650
Because what we were actually
tracking were faces.

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:26.050
But just think of it as the observation,

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.670
we're actually talking about
them as being Zs previously.

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:35.100
So the goal is to predict
the target location

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:41.400
based upon our last belief about where
it was and our current new measurements,

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.740
and in fact, what we need to be able
to evaluate is this probability of

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:51.290
the location given my last
belief plus my new measurement.

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:52.950
Now, we've done this before, right?

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:56.240
We've said that this equation was
made up of two components, and

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.650
we'll just copy them back up here.

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:03.450
The two components are the,
we'll do the purple one first,

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:05.390
that's just our dynamics model.

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.390
That says, if I know where
thing was at time T minus one,

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.200
what's my belief about where
it might be at time T?

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:17.400
Now in their work here, they used, the
fancy word for it is Brownian motion.

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.180
For those of you remember,

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.090
that's little particles just vibrating
around doing whatever they want.

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.040
Another way of thinking about it is,
they don't have a velocity model.

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.720
They basically say, if something is
here In the next frame it's going to be

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.460
somewhere around here and
maybe rotated a little bit, and

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.360
it doesn't remember
anything about velocity.

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.470
So, it's just based upon position.

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:40.080
But the new part that's kind of cool
here is this observation model.

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.550
This observation model
is the probability

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:46.620
of the observation given the,
the state, given the location.

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.930
And what they're going to do there is
they're going to use that eigenbasis

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:50.790
approximation.

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.590
So what that means is, I'm going to say,
if I can reconstruct this patch

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.940
well from my basis set,
that's going to be a high probability.

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:04.130
And if I can't reconstruct it well,
that's going to be a low probability.

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.810
That's fundamentally the observation
model that they're going to use.
