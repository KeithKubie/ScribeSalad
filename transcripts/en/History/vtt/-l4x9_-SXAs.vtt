00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:01.830
 Your weapons look fantastic.

00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:04.140
It's time to see how they
hold up in our weapons test.

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.415
We're gonna lead it all
off with a kill test.

00:00:06.415 --> 00:00:07.114
Doug?

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:12.180
 Bladesmiths, to see
what kind of lethal damage

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:14.220
your weapon will do,
we'll take your bagh nakh

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:16.890
and deliver multiple
slashes, and thrusts,

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.960
and claw at this big carcass.

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:20.740
Josh, you're up first.

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:22.170
You ready for this?
- So ready.

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.158
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:48.066 --> 00:00:50.070
 [INAUDIBLE] I
want to thank you.

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.180
All right, Josh, first
up, it's comfortable.

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.800
My three fingers
in the middle allow

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.920
me to grasp on to
the claws easily,

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.230
and not feel that
it's gonna impede

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.820
my movement with the hand.

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.830
The clawing is very deep.

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.770
Your slashes cut deep
into this pig carcass.

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.360
Overall, your bagh
nakh will kill.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:12.060
Good job.

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:12.900
 Thank you.

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.040
HOST: All right,
Chad, your turn.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:14.940
You ready?
- Yes, sir.

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.904
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.020
 All right, Chad,
first off, the handle--

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:36.740
it's on the thinner side.

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.650
There's a little bit
of movement there.

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:42.320
But the positions where you
have the claw is secure.

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:43.480
It's safe.

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:44.970
They're razor sharp.

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.170
On the lacerations
there, the slicing--

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:48.980
it cuts deeply.

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:51.340
Overall, your weapon will kill.

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:52.200
 Thank you.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.900
 Ben?

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.070
 Bladesmiths, to test the
strength and durability

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:59.710
of your bagh nakh, I'm gonna
be clawing and stabbing

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:01.420
away at these logs.

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.880
Remember, this test is all about
what happens to your blades,

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.607
not what happens to the log.

00:02:05.607 --> 00:02:07.039
Josh, you're up first.
You ready?

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:09.076
 I'm ready.

00:02:09.076 --> 00:02:11.320
I'm nervous about
the strength test.

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.000
I'm worried about the
tip, because the tip is

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.980
the thinnest part of the blade.

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.682
There's a chance of a fracture.

00:02:18.682 --> 00:02:21.670
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:42.088 --> 00:02:45.480
 Well, Josh, the claws
held up very well.

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.840
There's no mark on them that
they've ever even seen a tree,

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.680
but you lost your tips.

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:52.620
 Yeah.

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.510
BEN: The first one
went as I started

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.660
to pry, but the second tip--

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.010
it cracked as soon
as I stabbed in.

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.870
I liked the feeling
of these in my hands.

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.610
They were comfortable to wield.

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:06.680
But you know, you can't deny
that they're not there anymore.

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.079
Chad, you're up next.
You ready?

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:09.660
 Yes, sir.

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.940
After seeing Josh's
tips break, I'm nervous.

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.600
It might happen to mine.

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.430
If you didn't get your
heat treat just right,

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.615
they're gonna break.

00:03:17.615 --> 00:03:21.080
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:43.130
 Well, Chad, you
lost one of your tips.

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:45.100
The other one was scaring me.

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:46.430
But it's in one piece.

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:47.750
It held up well.

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:48.990
I like that you did Damascus.

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.940
I like the pattern of it.

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:51.350
It's really pretty.

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:52.970
Overall, well done.

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:54.890
 Thank you.

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:56.970
 Bladesmiths, what
started as a round

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:01.110
one nuts and bolts challenge
came down to these bagh nakh.

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:04.170
Both of you put in an
incredible amount of work.

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:06.150
Unfortunately, in this
arena of competition,

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.160
there can only be one
"Forged in Fire" champion.

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:12.690
Chad, congratulations.

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:14.550
You are a new "Forged
in Fire" champion.

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:15.580
Good job.

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:19.320
Josh, unfortunately, your bagh
nakh did not make the cut.

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.170
 Josh, you brought us a matched
pair of beautiful knives--

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:24.240
very sharp and
comfortable in the hand.

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.190
But unfortunately,
in the strength test,

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:27.490
yours took more damage.

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:28.780
And that's why I
had to let you go.

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:30.423
 I understand.

00:04:30.423 --> 00:04:33.140
 Josh, please
surrender your weapons.

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:35.880
JOSH: I'm a little discouraged,
a little disappointed,

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:38.340
but I'll bounce back.

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.560
I'm really proud to
make it this far.

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.510
To me, it's real
acknowledgment that I

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:43.920
have a skill set for this.

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:47.250
And I'm gonna keep pursuing
it, keep getting better,

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:49.250
learn from my mistakes.
