WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:03.310
Okay.
So we're,
uh,

2
00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:07.320
finishing up on talking about aromatic compounds,

3
00:00:07.321 --> 00:00:11.040
about the chemistry of benzene.
You know,
this was,

4
00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.500
this was a big deal in the,

5
00:00:13.501 --> 00:00:18.150
in the 19th century in part because you had reactions that were clean,

6
00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:23.450
the compounds where often a robust and easy to purify,

7
00:00:23.851 --> 00:00:25.260
crystallized and so on.

8
00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:30.620
So it was so many of the early developments in organic chemistry,

9
00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.140
especially in the second half of the 19th century,

10
00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.410
had to do with aromatic chemistry nowadays that we have a more versatile

11
00:00:39.781 --> 00:00:43.740
techniques for analyzing things like Nmr and for separating things,

12
00:00:43.741 --> 00:00:45.390
various kinds of chromatography,

13
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.230
it's possible to work on a much wider variety of molecules.

14
00:00:49.231 --> 00:00:51.600
So much recent chemistry's on other subjects,

15
00:00:51.601 --> 00:00:56.100
but much of the classical work was on aromatic compounds and they still,

16
00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:57.570
uh,
are important.

17
00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:01.620
So the Friedel crafts reaction we were just beginning with,

18
00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.340
and we'll talk today about,
uh,

19
00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:09.380
some ideas about how you design syntheses and about Ben Zelig stabilization,

20
00:01:10.981 --> 00:01:15.981
the reactivity at positions next to a aromatic system and about try fennel

21
00:01:16.711 --> 00:01:17.131
methyl,

22
00:01:17.131 --> 00:01:21.900
which was particularly important compound for the development of chemistry in

23
00:01:21.901 --> 00:01:26.901
the u s so a subtext of what we're talking about today is how chemistry

24
00:01:26.911 --> 00:01:30.750
developed in the United States.
Because as we mentioned last time,

25
00:01:30.751 --> 00:01:33.210
James Mason crafts was an American,

26
00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:36.630
but almost all his important work was done.

27
00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:40.830
Essentially all his important work was done in France and published in French,

28
00:01:40.831 --> 00:01:44.760
almost all of it.
Uh,
so although he was an American,

29
00:01:44.761 --> 00:01:47.720
many people thought he was French.
You remember he,

30
00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.960
he started working in [inaudible] lab essentially as a graduate student,

31
00:01:51.961 --> 00:01:56.730
although he wasn't enrolled as a student,
I don't believe,
and met his,
uh,

32
00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.490
seven year older colleague,
a student,

33
00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.240
the first student of warts in that lab and they published a number of papers

34
00:02:03.241 --> 00:02:07.650
together.
Then he published nothing at Cornell and Mit.
That was a textbook.

35
00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:11.520
And then he came back to Paris and published this enormous number of papers,

36
00:02:11.521 --> 00:02:15.840
a hundred papers in 17 years,
almost all of them with free Dell.

37
00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.460
And in particular that paper or that set of papers in 1877,

38
00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.900
which was the free del crafts,
a reaction.
Now,
how did they get into that?

39
00:02:24.901 --> 00:02:28.860
They got into that because they had been students together with boards,

40
00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.090
right?
And when he came back to work in free Dell's lab,

41
00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.020
it was natural that they should follow up on what on the kinds of things they

42
00:02:37.021 --> 00:02:38.110
were doing.
Uh,

43
00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.130
at that time on the kind of thing that [inaudible] was interested in.

44
00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:45.170
So seven years before that timeline started,
uh,
for,

45
00:02:45.171 --> 00:02:48.720
it's published a paper on a new class of radicals.
And bear in mind,

46
00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.190
this is 1855.

47
00:02:50.191 --> 00:02:54.660
So this is just before Cooper and calculate got the idea of valence,
right?

48
00:02:54.661 --> 00:02:58.470
So this was when types and,
uh,
and radicals were competing,

49
00:02:58.471 --> 00:03:01.990
so of works was in France.
And he wrote this in his,
uh,

50
00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:07.210
in his thing about,
uh,
a special reaction of iodides with sodium.

51
00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.300
And if we translate that into modern atomic weights,

52
00:03:10.301 --> 00:03:15.301
it's ethyl iodide and butyl iodide reacting with sodium to give Ethel Butyl,

53
00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.090
right?
Those are his new rat,
new class of radicals.

54
00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.240
So hexane plus two sodium iodide.

55
00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:26.650
Now this is the infamous votes reaction.
You hear about the worths reaction.

56
00:03:26.651 --> 00:03:30.760
The main place you hear about worths reaction is on the exam papers of

57
00:03:30.761 --> 00:03:34.900
elementary organic students who figure you could make any carbon carbon bond by

58
00:03:34.901 --> 00:03:38.520
taking to a halogens two to haylight ads and,

59
00:03:38.521 --> 00:03:41.890
and treating them with sodium.
But this is a horrid reaction.

60
00:03:41.891 --> 00:03:43.330
It gives terrible yields.

61
00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.830
It was possible for him to do this because the products were often gaseous,
but,

62
00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:50.710
but you,
but,
but there was,

63
00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.130
it was not at all a high yield reaction cause you get a lot of crossover.

64
00:03:54.131 --> 00:03:56.840
You can get athlete with Ethel butyl with Butyl,
uh,

65
00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:59.290
you can get a radical reactions.

66
00:03:59.291 --> 00:04:03.910
You can also get a ionic reactions of the ethyl sodium and butyl iodide.

67
00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:05.830
It's a mess.
Right?

68
00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:11.250
So the question that occurred to these guys at 1877 was might other metals work

69
00:04:11.621 --> 00:04:15.700
better?
Okay.
In particular,
how about aluminum?

70
00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:19.030
So they tried reacting,
uh,

71
00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:23.930
alcohol Haylight I'll heal chloride with aluminum,
with the idea of,

72
00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:27.040
of getting our two and aluminum chloride.

73
00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.360
That would be analogous,
analogous reaction with a different metal.

74
00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:35.410
The question is,
does it work?
Right.
And of course they were chemists,

75
00:04:35.411 --> 00:04:40.210
they did chemistry and chem is try as they said.
So they tried it.

76
00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:42.393
Okay.

77
00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:47.200
So what they found was it didn't give a very good yield of what they wanted and

78
00:04:47.201 --> 00:04:50.800
it gave a lot of hcl and notice that that's very different.

79
00:04:50.801 --> 00:04:55.060
It's not the metal that's reacted with the chloride,
it's the,
it's hydrogen.

80
00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:58.000
Where did the hydrogen come from?
Okay.

81
00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:00.940
And there was lots of that.

82
00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:05.970
There were as many moles of Hcl is there were of the Lko haylight to begin with.

83
00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:10.690
Right.
But very little aluminum chloride and very little of the,

84
00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:15.490
of the r two right now,
when they tried to distill this stuff,

85
00:05:15.491 --> 00:05:17.980
so they didn't get the gas,
but when they tried to distill,

86
00:05:17.981 --> 00:05:22.300
they found higher boiling stuff and it was poor in hydrogen.

87
00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:23.830
When they analyzed it,

88
00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:28.420
that means that it had a lot of double bonds in it or rings or both.

89
00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:30.193
Right?

90
00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:35.880
So they decided it was actually benzene with our groups attached to that.

91
00:05:36.011 --> 00:05:39.250
Where did the benzene come from?
Where did the hydrogen come from?

92
00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:42.880
From the solvent.
Benzene.
Right.

93
00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:46.330
And then the interesting thing about the,
about the aluminum,

94
00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:49.960
they found that the reaction was initially very slow,

95
00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:54.100
but the rate dependent on how much aluminum chloride there was,

96
00:05:54.101 --> 00:05:57.140
as the reaction went on,
you've got a little bit of aluminum chloride in.

97
00:05:57.141 --> 00:05:59.000
The more you got the faster at wet,

98
00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:02.900
until indeed it was almost impossible to control the reaction,

99
00:06:02.901 --> 00:06:04.490
although it started very fast.

100
00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:08.360
So they began to wonder whether the aluminum had anything to do with it or

101
00:06:08.361 --> 00:06:11.120
whether it was just aluminum chloride.
And they decided that was true.

102
00:06:11.121 --> 00:06:14.560
They didn't need aluminum,
just aluminum chloride.
Right?
So,

103
00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:18.020
so this is completely different from what they set out to study.

104
00:06:18.021 --> 00:06:21.230
It's not an [inaudible] type reaction at all.
It's completely different.

105
00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:23.120
You have to rearrange things.

106
00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:28.360
It's an aluminum chloride catalyzed reaction of RCL with an aromatic compounds.

107
00:06:29.331 --> 00:06:31.280
It's an aromatic substitution,

108
00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:36.080
carbon radical goes on in place of hydrogen onto the benzene.

109
00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:41.150
So this is a completely different kind of substitution from what they had set

110
00:06:41.151 --> 00:06:41.984
out to study.

111
00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:47.320
But notice that it's rather analogous to the idea of chlorine reacting with

112
00:06:47.451 --> 00:06:52.130
Ketalysis by try chloro aluminum that we looked at last time where the try

113
00:06:52.131 --> 00:06:56.330
chloro aluminum helps make the cl minus alleving group.
So it's,

114
00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:00.200
it looks like it could be the same deal.
Of course,
this was mystery to them.
This,

115
00:07:00.201 --> 00:07:03.080
this is much later insight about what the mechanism is,

116
00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:07.260
but it's the same idea with our cl instead of CLC,

117
00:07:07.261 --> 00:07:09.300
l a and in Pasta,

118
00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:14.410
it's even possible that you could get sn one versions of this where the ALC l

119
00:07:14.421 --> 00:07:18.800
three pulls off chloride and you have our plus if they are pluses sufficiently

120
00:07:18.801 --> 00:07:22.760
stable.
Okay.
So,
uh,

121
00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:25.970
they published this first paper in 1877.

122
00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:31.040
The title of it was on a new general method for synthesizing hydrocarbons,

123
00:07:31.041 --> 00:07:34.990
ketones,
etc. So a new way to form a carbon carbon bonds.

124
00:07:34.991 --> 00:07:39.991
So you could have RCL and an aromatic compounds react in the ketalysis by ALC l

125
00:07:40.401 --> 00:07:43.850
three and get the substitute of benzene and Hcl.

126
00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:45.650
Now they say it's general.

127
00:07:45.651 --> 00:07:50.651
So they tried a number of different things they tried are radicals that had one,

128
00:07:50.751 --> 00:07:54.620
two and five carbons in this very first paper of just a couple of pages.

129
00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:58.820
They say they took about five weeks to do all this work that I'm telling you

130
00:07:58.821 --> 00:08:02.570
about.
Okay.
They also use bromide and iodide.

131
00:08:02.571 --> 00:08:07.100
That worked as well as chloride.
They use Taleo Queen as well as benzene.
In fact,

132
00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:11.720
[inaudible] was better because they could get it pure to begin with,
right?

133
00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:13.760
So they say they could do it.

134
00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:18.530
They had a system where they could keep the city the thing warm and,
and uh,

135
00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:23.270
and try chloro Beth methyl chloride bubbling through.

136
00:08:23.271 --> 00:08:27.890
That's a gas night and day.
So they ran it for a long time,
for several days.

137
00:08:27.891 --> 00:08:31.910
They don't say exactly how many at 80 degrees.
And it,
of course,

138
00:08:31.911 --> 00:08:36.170
you could do a substitution of methyl for hydrogen.
You could do a second,

139
00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:40.970
third,
fourth,
fifth.
So from this they got Penta,

140
00:08:40.971 --> 00:08:45.920
Claro and hexachlorobenzene.
Both of these were new compounds.

141
00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:48.890
So a new synthetic method means a brand new compounds.

142
00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:52.820
So no one had ever seen these before.
How did they know what they had?
Well,

143
00:08:52.821 --> 00:08:54.680
in the case of the hexachlorobenzene,

144
00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:59.860
they able to prepare several hundred grams this way it's melting point was 164.

145
00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:04.590
Nowadays we say it's 165.
So they had very good stuff.

146
00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:09.240
They measured the molecular weight and they got the correct value within 2% by

147
00:09:09.241 --> 00:09:13.920
measuring the density of the vapor.
But an even,
uh,

148
00:09:13.921 --> 00:09:15.810
a strongly confirmative,

149
00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:20.280
a confirmatory observation was that they could oxidize it.

150
00:09:20.281 --> 00:09:22.170
They tried a number of methods of oxidation,

151
00:09:22.171 --> 00:09:25.500
but the one that gave a good yield was to treat it with cold potassium

152
00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:30.360
permanganate for two months.
So that wasn't done in the five weeks.
Okay.

153
00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:33.510
But they were able to get the Hex,
a carboxylic acid,

154
00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:38.370
which remarkably enough had been known since 1799.

155
00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:41.460
Of course in 1799,
they didn't know what structure,

156
00:09:41.461 --> 00:09:44.610
they didn't know from structure altogether until 1858.

157
00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:47.400
But buyer had recently showed that this compounds,

158
00:09:47.401 --> 00:09:50.040
which was isolated pure in 1799,

159
00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:55.200
I was hexachlorobenzene a heck a hex.
The carboxylic acid of benzene,

160
00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:57.270
right?
Incidentally,

161
00:09:57.271 --> 00:10:01.800
the source of it in nature as this is a natural mineral called honey stone,

162
00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:04.380
which is this stuff,
right?

163
00:10:04.381 --> 00:10:08.280
It comes in nature probably from oxidizing graphite or something like that.

164
00:10:08.281 --> 00:10:11.340
I don't know where it comes from exactly,
but it was a known,

165
00:10:11.341 --> 00:10:14.190
so once you've make a known product,
then you know what this new stuff is.

166
00:10:14.191 --> 00:10:17.430
But the important thing was that they were able to make completely new compounds

167
00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:22.490
and make old compounds in new,
more efficient ways.
Um,

168
00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:25.260
okay,
so this was alkylation,

169
00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:30.300
it's Friedel crafts alkylation putting an alcohol group on to benzene,
right?

170
00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:36.190
So there were other Al collations they found out they could use,
uh,
uh,

171
00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:39.300
an Lpl group that had a benzene on it already,

172
00:10:39.301 --> 00:10:44.301
like a Benzel chloride here could react with benzene to give die fennel methane

173
00:10:45.090 --> 00:10:48.510
that was already known.
Okay.
But this was a good way to make it,

174
00:10:48.930 --> 00:10:53.580
or they could use chloroform and make and put three,

175
00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:57.620
uh,
uh,
benzenes on it and get,
try Klara uh,

176
00:10:57.630 --> 00:11:00.660
to try fennel methane.
And that was also known,

177
00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:05.700
but what was new was that they could use carbon tetrachloride and do one

178
00:11:05.701 --> 00:11:08.280
substitution,
then another,
then another,
then another,

179
00:11:08.281 --> 00:11:12.780
and get tetra fennel methane.
Right.
Which was an unknown compound.

180
00:11:13.410 --> 00:11:14.243
In fact,

181
00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:18.240
it wasn't even known then because it turned out that wasn't what they had,

182
00:11:18.241 --> 00:11:20.400
although it's what they said they had.
Right.

183
00:11:20.401 --> 00:11:22.560
Because it's hard to know these things.
Right.

184
00:11:22.561 --> 00:11:27.060
It wasn't that because it's too crowded to try to get four federal groups on a

185
00:11:27.061 --> 00:11:31.950
single carbon.
Right.
Uh,
so it was try it.
So it only did,

186
00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:35.030
uh,
it only did three substitutions,
not four,

187
00:11:35.031 --> 00:11:36.930
and it was the trifocal methyl chloride,

188
00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:41.400
but it didn't have chlorine anymore because they worked it up with water and the

189
00:11:41.401 --> 00:11:46.140
water changed the chloride into it.
Ooh.
Right.
An sn one reaction.

190
00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:50.640
So that was,
but that was a new compound for them.
Okay.
Uh,

191
00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:55.270
but they found that if you use fennel,
Heloc pride,
chloro benzene,

192
00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:59.980
if the chlorine was on the benzene ring,
then didn't react.

193
00:11:59.981 --> 00:12:04.900
So it wasn't perfectly general,
but it could use Al Keel or air owl keel.

194
00:12:04.901 --> 00:12:07.900
That is fennel on a,
on a carbon.
Right.

195
00:12:07.930 --> 00:12:10.330
So you could have Benzel or,

196
00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:15.400
but you couldn't have Ariel as the,
as the group.
Okay.

197
00:12:15.401 --> 00:12:19.330
But then it was noticed that they also said it could use to make ketones,

198
00:12:19.331 --> 00:12:21.010
how to bake a kito in that way.

199
00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:25.660
So you start with a chloride that already has a c double bond o in it and acid

200
00:12:25.661 --> 00:12:30.070
chloride.
And when they reacted a Benzo wheel chloride with benzene,

201
00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:34.120
they got a dye phenol ketone,
which was a known compound.

202
00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:38.950
But this was a better way to make it.
They could get with asset deal chloride,

203
00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:43.120
they could get a fennel methyl ketone.
That was a known compound.

204
00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:48.580
Here was an interesting one with uh,
with a dye acid,
chloride,

205
00:12:48.581 --> 00:12:51.160
Valeo fluoride.
They could get a compound,

206
00:12:51.161 --> 00:12:54.730
which I think was unknown at that time with two phenol groups put on.

207
00:12:54.731 --> 00:12:59.731
So it could react twice or it could react twice with the same benzine molecule,

208
00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:06.310
right?
To give that right.
And that was a compound that was known.

209
00:13:06.311 --> 00:13:10.390
They anthraquinone so they could get ketones as well as opposite as a very,

210
00:13:10.391 --> 00:13:11.980
very general reaction.

211
00:13:11.981 --> 00:13:16.480
Very important for synthesis so that you could use a seal as well as Al Keel.

212
00:13:16.481 --> 00:13:19.720
So you have free crafts,
not only free del crest alkylation,

213
00:13:20.050 --> 00:13:24.220
but Friedel crafts accolation to make ketones.
Okay.

214
00:13:24.430 --> 00:13:27.850
Now how would you do what?
What is the question mark?

215
00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:32.770
What compound do you need to do a free del crafts reaction to get that compound

216
00:13:33.070 --> 00:13:38.070
name the question Mark Leon,

217
00:13:40.791 --> 00:13:41.624
what would you use?

218
00:13:46.490 --> 00:13:50.220
<v 1>[inaudible] good</v>

219
00:13:50.770 --> 00:13:55.420
<v 0>one fluoro profane or purple cloth n propyl chloride,
right?</v>

220
00:13:56.350 --> 00:13:59.470
That compound.
Okay,
so does it work?

221
00:13:59.650 --> 00:14:01.570
We'll try a warning.

222
00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:06.370
Remember that once you put one out kill group on,
we talked about last time,

223
00:14:06.371 --> 00:14:09.910
it becomes more reactive.
So there's going to be a problem.

224
00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:14.020
If the product is 25 times as reactive as the starting material,

225
00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:18.220
then you're going to get higher substitution instead of being able to get a good

226
00:14:18.221 --> 00:14:23.140
yield of what you want,
right?
But the good news was that if they did it for five,

227
00:14:23.141 --> 00:14:25.780
if it was done for five hours with aluminum chloride,

228
00:14:25.781 --> 00:14:29.490
this was done by [inaudible] in 1940,
uh,

229
00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:34.360
he was able to get about a 45% yield of mono substitution.

230
00:14:34.630 --> 00:14:38.690
Now when you read yield,
do you often wonder what it means now?
Easily,

231
00:14:38.691 --> 00:14:43.691
you'd say you get 45 as 45 is 45% as many moles of the product as you have of

232
00:14:45.371 --> 00:14:48.130
starting material.
That's what you would read that now easily.

233
00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:49.960
But that's not what they went men,

234
00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:52.610
because if you used half the starting material,

235
00:14:52.611 --> 00:14:56.390
so at the latter stages you have nearly as much of this as you do have the

236
00:14:56.391 --> 00:14:58.400
starting benzene and it's,

237
00:14:58.490 --> 00:15:02.780
and this and this stuff is reacting 25 times faster,
right?

238
00:15:02.781 --> 00:15:07.490
There's no way you're going get the 45% yield.
Right?
So,

239
00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:12.670
so what they mean is 45% of the product is mano as opposed to die try tetra

240
00:15:14.931 --> 00:15:17.690
substituted.
Right?
So in fact,

241
00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:22.130
probably only about 15% of the benzene was consumed,

242
00:15:22.190 --> 00:15:26.120
but still they could get half of the product was mano substitution.

243
00:15:26.121 --> 00:15:28.280
At that point.
Okay,
that's great.

244
00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:33.020
But the bad news is that of the mono substitution,

245
00:15:33.021 --> 00:15:38.021
it's not just the compound that Leon wanted to make it 60% of that and 40% of

246
00:15:39.951 --> 00:15:43.220
the one we wanted right now that was done.

247
00:15:43.490 --> 00:15:47.750
This is so that you could have rearrangement during the Friedel crafts

248
00:15:47.751 --> 00:15:48.620
alkylation.

249
00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:53.870
Now that was done at a slightly warm temperature,
right?

250
00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:57.050
If they did it at minus six degrees,

251
00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:01.310
then it turned around and you got more of the compound you wanted.
Right?

252
00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:05.840
But still there's rearrangement somehow.
How does the rearrangement occur?
Well,

253
00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:09.470
remember the aluminum chloride comes up and pull and starts pulling off the

254
00:16:09.471 --> 00:16:14.150
chloride and makes a complex like this with the incipient cad I,

255
00:16:14.151 --> 00:16:15.680
and it's probably,
it's not a real,

256
00:16:15.681 --> 00:16:19.370
you wouldn't expect the primary cad I into form easily.
Right?
But,

257
00:16:19.371 --> 00:16:22.190
but you've got the,
the aluminum attached there.

258
00:16:22.191 --> 00:16:26.100
So it's beginning to develop a charge.
But if,
so,

259
00:16:26.390 --> 00:16:31.070
that thing that you see there,
that complex can react with the benzene.

260
00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:36.200
That is,
benzene comes in and displaces the ALC l four okay.

261
00:16:36.201 --> 00:16:37.130
So you get the,

262
00:16:37.250 --> 00:16:42.250
the intermediate with both h and the end propyl attached to the same carbon that

263
00:16:42.711 --> 00:16:44.240
cad ion,
right?

264
00:16:44.510 --> 00:16:49.340
And then you lose the Proton and you've got the product,
one of the products,

265
00:16:49.341 --> 00:16:52.160
but the other product comes because,
uh,

266
00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:57.350
so that gives the end propyl benzene,
but there's a hydrogen here,
right?

267
00:16:57.410 --> 00:17:01.570
And so what else could happen when you start pulling the chloride away?

268
00:17:04.860 --> 00:17:08.840
You can get a hydride shift.
Bingo.
Okay.

269
00:17:08.841 --> 00:17:10.940
So the hydride goes there,
the chloride,

270
00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:15.050
the cat eye and moves to the middle and now you get the other product.

271
00:17:15.290 --> 00:17:18.500
But notice if you do it cold,
if you do it to minus six degrees,

272
00:17:18.650 --> 00:17:22.940
you get more of the initial reaction before the hydride shift occurs.

273
00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:27.320
So it's possible to get,
uh,
to get the product.

274
00:17:27.321 --> 00:17:29.690
You want at least a substantial amount of it.

275
00:17:29.691 --> 00:17:32.450
But you have to be worried about rearrangement.

276
00:17:32.451 --> 00:17:36.980
If the cat die and that you're trying to put on is one that could rearrange to a

277
00:17:36.981 --> 00:17:40.610
more stable cad ion.
Okay.
Now,

278
00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:46.310
how about if you wanted to make seal elation?
Okay.

279
00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:51.270
Uh,
there you don't get rearrangement.
Why not?

280
00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:55.200
Because when you,
when you were making this cad ion,

281
00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:59.940
it stabilized by an unshared pair on the oxygen,
right?

282
00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:01.830
So it doesn't rearrange.

283
00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:06.810
It's already the most stable cat eye you can get from that.
So with Acla action,

284
00:18:06.811 --> 00:18:10.320
you don't get rearrangement,
but you need one equivalent,

285
00:18:10.321 --> 00:18:14.550
not just a catalytic about of aluminum try chloride because it can,

286
00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:19.700
it gets eaten up by the product by associated with the carbonyl group and by the

287
00:18:19.801 --> 00:18:23.090
starting material as well,
actually,
uh,
that,
uh,

288
00:18:23.670 --> 00:18:25.590
complex is that way as well.

289
00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:29.190
But even though you've got a lot of aluminum chloride in there,

290
00:18:29.191 --> 00:18:33.150
you can easily get rid of it just by heading water once you have the product,

291
00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:38.280
right?
So now you have the,
this unrea arranged ketone,
but suppose what?

292
00:18:38.281 --> 00:18:40.260
You really want it in your heart of hearts.

293
00:18:40.261 --> 00:18:44.340
Leon was not the key tone you wanted propyl benzene,

294
00:18:45.030 --> 00:18:49.080
right?
Ah,
that's what you want.
How can you get there?

295
00:18:49.410 --> 00:18:50.820
By removing the,

296
00:18:51.030 --> 00:18:54.840
Oh and replacing it with h two and their reagents for doing that,

297
00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:58.980
like the Clemmensen reduction treat with zinc and hydrochloric acid.

298
00:18:59.310 --> 00:19:03.300
Now that's a very strong,
acidic medium.
So maybe your compound,

299
00:19:03.301 --> 00:19:06.210
other things in your compound wouldn't stand up to it.

300
00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:10.140
Propylene Benzine is one thing.
A more complicated molecule is something else.

301
00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:14.760
Maybe the thing you want won't tolerate acid,
but it will tolerate base.

302
00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:19.980
Then you could use the wolf Kitchener reduction with hydrazine and potassium

303
00:19:19.981 --> 00:19:22.980
hydroxide.
But notice it's done at 200 degrees.

304
00:19:23.420 --> 00:19:27.450
So that's a very vigorous,
a basic thing.
Yeah.
If neither of these work,

305
00:19:27.451 --> 00:19:29.970
both of them are cheap and,
and give good yields.

306
00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:33.660
But if neither of them work there,
other reagents nowadays that you could use,

307
00:19:33.661 --> 00:19:37.790
those are the classical reagents for changing the ACL to an Al Keel.

308
00:19:37.950 --> 00:19:41.610
But the important thing to see here is that you've now been able to make that

309
00:19:41.611 --> 00:19:46.611
compound without worrying about the rearrangement by going by way of the ketone.

310
00:19:48.210 --> 00:19:52.320
Okay.
Now,
so that's a synthetic strategy,
right?

311
00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:55.680
So let's think about what things you can get from benzene,

312
00:19:55.681 --> 00:20:00.390
what groups you can put on using aromatic substitutions that we talked about

313
00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:04.120
last time.
And also the Al Kill and ACL.
Uh,

314
00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:09.270
El crafts reactions.
Okay.
We said you could put,
do teary Amman with d two.

315
00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:14.320
So for chlorine on with chlorine and ALC l three or bromine with bromine and

316
00:20:14.451 --> 00:20:17.970
Feb,
br,
three or other metal salts can work as well.

317
00:20:17.971 --> 00:20:20.130
These so called Lewis Acids,
right?

318
00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:25.550
Or You could use the Friedel crafts isolation and make a ketone or alkylation

319
00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:29.550
would make an alk.
You'll talk about as long as it doesn't rearrange.
Right?

320
00:20:29.910 --> 00:20:34.910
Or You could even put COO on with HCL HCL will protonate CEO to make the cat

321
00:20:37.011 --> 00:20:41.310
eye.
And that then puts on Hco as a substitution reaction.

322
00:20:41.670 --> 00:20:45.690
So that one will work too.
Or are you could put a nitro group on,

323
00:20:45.691 --> 00:20:49.090
we said with nitric acid,
sometimes with sulfuric acid,

324
00:20:49.091 --> 00:20:52.820
if you need it to be more reactive or are you can put on a s.

325
00:20:52.930 --> 00:20:54.850
So three h that is,

326
00:20:54.851 --> 00:20:59.851
so three can get protonated buy sulfuric acid and then the hso three could go on

327
00:21:01.121 --> 00:21:03.640
and give these Sophonic acid products.

328
00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:07.030
So there are lots of different things you could put on benzene this way.

329
00:21:08.620 --> 00:21:12.130
Okay.
And in fact,
the sole phonic acid can come off again.
The,

330
00:21:12.131 --> 00:21:16.390
so three can come off again if you treat it very hot with Steve.

331
00:21:17.410 --> 00:21:20.380
Uh,
okay.
And you might wonder,

332
00:21:20.410 --> 00:21:24.160
why would you do that if you went to all the work to put it on right?

333
00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:27.760
And you'll see shortly why that is.
Okay.

334
00:21:27.761 --> 00:21:31.990
Now you can also get other compounds by changing these groups into something

335
00:21:31.991 --> 00:21:33.790
else.
For example,
the nitro group,

336
00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:38.380
you could reduce it either catalytically with palladium or by using a reagent of

337
00:21:38.381 --> 00:21:43.381
metal like tin and Hcl and get Anelyn the Amino benzene.

338
00:21:43.601 --> 00:21:48.601
So an Otu can become an h two and then you could treat an h two with nitrous

339
00:21:49.931 --> 00:21:54.160
acid,
right?
Uh,
it's,
it's uh,
uh,

340
00:21:54.550 --> 00:21:57.130
sodium nitrite and Hcl,

341
00:21:57.340 --> 00:22:02.340
the HCL protonate that you get nitrous acid and that changes Nh two into end two

342
00:22:04.151 --> 00:22:08.950
plus,
right?
Which is called a [inaudible] compound.

343
00:22:09.630 --> 00:22:14.590
Uh,
uh,
dies,
OBGYNs,
benzine die,
Azonian chloride,

344
00:22:14.591 --> 00:22:18.910
that's called.
Now,
why in the world would you make that?
Well,

345
00:22:18.911 --> 00:22:23.770
it has a resonance structure here that has plus on the nitrogen and that could

346
00:22:23.771 --> 00:22:26.980
be the cad ion that does substitution,

347
00:22:27.610 --> 00:22:32.080
electrophilic aromatic aromatic substitution and notice that you're making it in

348
00:22:32.081 --> 00:22:36.970
the presence of something that's a very good,
very active receptor for that.

349
00:22:36.971 --> 00:22:38.710
So you could make this compound,

350
00:22:39.130 --> 00:22:43.210
which is important because it's yellow.

351
00:22:43.630 --> 00:22:46.780
It's a yellow dye,
it's called Anilin yellow.

352
00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:51.900
And it was the first such die that was made as a first of hundreds of these so

353
00:22:52.321 --> 00:22:54.760
called Aso dyes that are all different colors.

354
00:22:55.030 --> 00:22:58.000
I looked it up on the web to see if I can get a picture of something,

355
00:22:58.001 --> 00:23:03.001
died with it and find that it's very popular for skateboards nowadays to use

356
00:23:03.761 --> 00:23:08.320
anilin yellow.
Okay.
So,
uh,
uh,
but,

357
00:23:08.321 --> 00:23:09.970
but hundreds of these were made.

358
00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:13.480
This was where the activity was in organic chemistry.

359
00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:16.630
This was before synthetic drugs,
right?

360
00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:19.360
This was before plastics.

361
00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:23.500
This was before the use of petroleum,
the way it's used nowadays.

362
00:23:23.501 --> 00:23:27.130
So there weren't these commercial driving forces for developing organic

363
00:23:27.131 --> 00:23:31.960
chemistry,
but dyes were important.
So the last half of the 19th century,

364
00:23:31.961 --> 00:23:33.910
there was a lot of work on things like this.

365
00:23:33.911 --> 00:23:38.911
So hundreds of these were developed and they have fancy names like Bismark Brown

366
00:23:39.011 --> 00:23:42.440
named after the chancellor,
the Iron Chancellor of Germany.
Right.

367
00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:46.400
Was a brown color.
And in fact,
that's still,
you noticed that that had,

368
00:23:46.430 --> 00:23:50.300
there were two of these reactions that went on to give Bismarck Brown,
right?

369
00:23:50.301 --> 00:23:53.690
It made two of these ASO groups in there and there's a zone.

370
00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:57.140
I looked up a Bismarck brown on the,
uh,

371
00:23:57.320 --> 00:24:02.180
on the web and find out that it's used as a histological stain.
There it is.
Okay.

372
00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:04.250
So this was big deal,

373
00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:09.230
but that's not the only reason that these dyes odium chloride was important in

374
00:24:09.231 --> 00:24:11.930
two is a fabulous leaving group.

375
00:24:11.931 --> 00:24:15.620
The n n triple bond is the strongest diatomic bond,

376
00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:18.500
so it very easily leaves as end to it.

377
00:24:18.501 --> 00:24:21.680
Notice that that's a very clean reaction to what it leaves.

378
00:24:21.681 --> 00:24:26.510
What does it leave behind if you lose?
And two from Benzene Daya Zone,
Eum uh,

379
00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:29.090
cad ions.
It's the phenol pad.

380
00:24:29.091 --> 00:24:32.510
I am a cat eye and it's very hard to make,
right?

381
00:24:32.511 --> 00:24:34.460
Because we talked about that before.

382
00:24:34.461 --> 00:24:39.020
It's a very strong bond and not a good place to have a vacancy in the orbital in

383
00:24:39.021 --> 00:24:42.260
an sp squared over.
It'll okay.

384
00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:46.760
So there are lots of uses for this synthetic uses for the dye sodium chloride

385
00:24:46.761 --> 00:24:51.630
besides making dies.
So you can treat it with HBR and copper bromide,

386
00:24:51.930 --> 00:24:53.120
brust bromide.

387
00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:58.120
See Ubr to put a bromine on in place of n two or chlorine on in place,

388
00:24:58.401 --> 00:25:00.160
or cyanide on in place of,

389
00:25:00.161 --> 00:25:05.150
in to now all of these reactions called Sandmeyer reactions after the guy who

390
00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:08.480
developed the idea of using the copper bromide,
uh,

391
00:25:08.810 --> 00:25:12.980
probably go first by an electron transfer from,

392
00:25:12.981 --> 00:25:17.981
so you have see you br two minus an electron comes,

393
00:25:18.890 --> 00:25:21.890
which is formed from br minus plus the copper bromide.

394
00:25:22.310 --> 00:25:25.450
So that gives an electron to the,
one of the oral,

395
00:25:25.510 --> 00:25:27.980
but one of the anti-bonding where it was a nitrogen.

396
00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:33.340
So you generate this radical instead of the cad ion and a radical from the

397
00:25:33.711 --> 00:25:34.760
copper reagent,

398
00:25:35.210 --> 00:25:40.010
but that's very unstable and loses nitrogen instantly into,

399
00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:41.900
okay,
so you have that radical,

400
00:25:42.140 --> 00:25:45.770
but now these radicals react with one another to put the bromine on.

401
00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:47.240
You have copper bromide,

402
00:25:47.241 --> 00:25:50.950
which then adds bromide minus again and recycles.

403
00:25:50.950 --> 00:25:55.820
So the coppers catalytic.
Okay.
So you can do it with also with chlorine.

404
00:25:55.821 --> 00:25:58.980
Also with cyanide,
you can do it with iodide.

405
00:25:58.981 --> 00:26:02.540
You don't even need the copper there because I minus itself could give the

406
00:26:02.541 --> 00:26:06.950
electron to the dye as odium compound.
You can do it with BF,

407
00:26:06.951 --> 00:26:11.540
four minus,
which is probably different.
That's probably not donation of electron.

408
00:26:11.541 --> 00:26:15.920
That one probably does involve losing into from the cad ion to form the fennel

409
00:26:15.921 --> 00:26:20.660
cad ion,
which then reacts with,
pulls off a fluoride for BF four minus.

410
00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:24.470
Okay.
So that's probably an sn one reaction right?

411
00:26:24.471 --> 00:26:27.110
Where and two leaves a great leaving group.

412
00:26:27.620 --> 00:26:32.390
And probably the same for the reaction with water to put Oah on.
Right?

413
00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:36.420
You can also react it with Nan o two to put an o two on.

414
00:26:37.610 --> 00:26:41.510
But what's the utility of that?
Why would you want to do that?

415
00:26:42.260 --> 00:26:44.290
Is that going to be,
uh,
you think,
uh,

416
00:26:44.550 --> 00:26:49.550
a way you're gonna make your fortune to sell nitrile benzene making it this way?

417
00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:52.380
What's the problem?

418
00:26:53.950 --> 00:26:54.783
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

419
00:26:58.180 --> 00:26:59.290
<v 0>No,
that's not the problem.</v>

420
00:27:01.910 --> 00:27:06.000
He had no two here is a man I n n.
A.
N.
O.
Two is an AI.
All right.

421
00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:09.910
We talked about not plus before,
but this is an ode to buy this.

422
00:27:09.911 --> 00:27:13.950
So this would do the trick.
But commercially this is bound to fail Matt.

423
00:27:14.060 --> 00:27:17.590
And you use that to get the guys?
Yeah,
that's where we got,
remember we,

424
00:27:17.620 --> 00:27:20.140
where did we get the the die zone?
Iom Salt.

425
00:27:20.141 --> 00:27:22.540
We got it from the mean where did we get the amine?

426
00:27:22.630 --> 00:27:26.590
We got it from the nitrile group so we could run our factory day at night and

427
00:27:26.591 --> 00:27:30.400
turn starting material into product at pretty good yield.
Right?

428
00:27:30.490 --> 00:27:32.230
But you're not going to make a fortune in that way,

429
00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:36.640
but there is utility for that but it's not obvious at first.
Okay.

430
00:27:36.641 --> 00:27:40.960
And the same thing is true here.
You can react with hypo fos for us acid,

431
00:27:40.961 --> 00:27:45.961
h three po two not phosphoric acid and that puts h odd instead of instead of the

432
00:27:47.861 --> 00:27:51.370
end too.
But that's going even further back to benzine.

433
00:27:51.371 --> 00:27:55.690
Why in the world would you want to do that while we'll show you what's the

434
00:27:55.691 --> 00:28:00.691
utility of that one now suppose you want to prepare a certain compound like a

435
00:28:01.090 --> 00:28:05.620
para Nitro,
chloro benzene.
Now,
how are you going to make it?
Well,

436
00:28:05.621 --> 00:28:10.180
you could start with nitro benzene and we know how to put a chlorine on.

437
00:28:10.181 --> 00:28:11.380
How do you put chlorine on?

438
00:28:13.540 --> 00:28:16.810
What reagents do you use to put fluoride on?
What?
What in general,

439
00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:19.990
to put any x on in place of age.

440
00:28:20.770 --> 00:28:25.570
What form of x do you need?
What's the thing that does the attack?
X,

441
00:28:25.571 --> 00:28:29.650
Y,
x,
radical x minus X.
Plus.

442
00:28:31.060 --> 00:28:35.950
It's electrophilic aromatic substitution.
You need x plus.

443
00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:38.800
So if we want to put chlorine in,
we need chlorine.
Plus.

444
00:28:39.070 --> 00:28:44.020
Where do we get chlorine plus cl two plus ALC.
All three.

445
00:28:44.850 --> 00:28:47.410
Alright.
Alc.
All three pulls the chloride off.

446
00:28:47.470 --> 00:28:52.470
We have the equivalent of cl plus and that that'll do the trick except it won't

447
00:28:53.261 --> 00:28:55.310
do the trick.
Why?

448
00:28:57.570 --> 00:28:58.403
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

449
00:28:58.650 --> 00:28:59.790
<v 0>Why won't this work?</v>

450
00:29:03.990 --> 00:29:05.340
We talked about it last time

451
00:29:09.870 --> 00:29:14.550
because Nitro is deactivating,
right?
It's make the reaction slow,

452
00:29:14.551 --> 00:29:16.740
but still it'll happen,
right?

453
00:29:17.100 --> 00:29:20.140
But not only is it deactivating,

454
00:29:20.220 --> 00:29:24.570
what else is it metta directing?
It's not going to give this product.

455
00:29:24.571 --> 00:29:29.010
It's going to give them that a product.
So are we out of luck?

456
00:29:29.011 --> 00:29:32.790
Is there a way of making the Para Chloro nitro benzene?

457
00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:34.710
How would you do it?

458
00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:37.133
<v 1>Okay,</v>

459
00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:41.950
<v 0>Sebastian.
Ah,
start so that it's not going to work.</v>

460
00:29:42.670 --> 00:29:47.020
Okay,
but start with the but it because you'd get the wrong isomer,

461
00:29:47.770 --> 00:29:51.490
right?
But if you start with the cl and put the night trow on,

462
00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:54.340
now the reaction is more reactive.

463
00:29:54.341 --> 00:29:58.120
Nitros a very strong or reactive reagent.

464
00:29:58.300 --> 00:30:00.890
And chlorella is Ortho,
para directing.

465
00:30:00.891 --> 00:30:03.040
So you're going to get the compounds you want.
Great.

466
00:30:03.610 --> 00:30:06.250
Now suppose what you want is Metta Chloro,

467
00:30:06.430 --> 00:30:09.760
phenyl hydroxy benzene.

468
00:30:10.690 --> 00:30:15.040
That's the one you want to make.
So how are we going to do that now?

469
00:30:15.041 --> 00:30:19.390
Because both Oh and C l r o throw,
para directing.

470
00:30:19.391 --> 00:30:22.810
So we can't decide which one we're going to put on.
Furthermore,

471
00:30:22.870 --> 00:30:26.080
we don't have the old plus reagent to put Oh,
on.
We can put,

472
00:30:26.081 --> 00:30:29.280
we have the cl plus reagent,
but we don't have the old plus reagents.

473
00:30:29.281 --> 00:30:33.580
So how are we going to get these things in the Meta position?
Well,

474
00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:35.900
we could put the chlorine on.
Remember these,

475
00:30:35.910 --> 00:30:40.510
we got Metta things by putting by that mistake we made before,

476
00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:44.780
right?
And now if we could convert nitro to,
Ooh,

477
00:30:45.310 --> 00:30:49.600
then we got the product.
We want any way of getting,
Ooh,

478
00:30:50.980 --> 00:30:54.010
those of you with rapid photographic memories,

479
00:30:56.580 --> 00:31:01.120
you convert Nitro to a mean.
Uh,

480
00:31:01.121 --> 00:31:04.090
I think you can reduce it with this reagent.
I'm not sure,

481
00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:08.230
but if not that when there'll be another one that allows you to reduce it.
Uh,

482
00:31:08.260 --> 00:31:09.360
then,
uh,

483
00:31:09.370 --> 00:31:14.370
h o n o converts it to the [inaudible] and water converts that to Ooh,

484
00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:19.420
right?
So we were able to do it that way by way of,

485
00:31:19.650 --> 00:31:24.220
of the nitro group converted and the Di's odium compound to,
Ooh,

486
00:31:24.230 --> 00:31:25.370
the dyes odium salt.

487
00:31:25.790 --> 00:31:30.790
Or You could also make it make it a halogen there or a night trial or an o two

488
00:31:31.310 --> 00:31:35.540
or h.
But of course,
if we're n o two,
you could do it a different way.
Okay.

489
00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:41.390
Now,
why would you want to do h
to make chloro benzine?

490
00:31:41.391 --> 00:31:44.770
That seems stupid.
Okay.
So that,

491
00:31:44.850 --> 00:31:49.850
that key reaction here is h o n o nitrous acid for converting a,

492
00:31:49.940 --> 00:31:54.380
an Anilin that the Amino benzene into any of many different things.

493
00:31:55.850 --> 00:31:58.400
Here's a picture of the Yale Chemistry class.

494
00:31:58.450 --> 00:32:03.450
The Sheffield Scientific School in 1898 so a lot of distinguished looking guys

495
00:32:03.861 --> 00:32:07.520
sitting here and they're showing the tools of their trade as we've mentioned

496
00:32:07.521 --> 00:32:08.354
before.

497
00:32:08.690 --> 00:32:12.620
But if there's a little box at the seed of the guy who's playing a flask,

498
00:32:12.621 --> 00:32:15.680
like a Banjo here.
And do you see what it says on it?

499
00:32:17.540 --> 00:32:22.310
Hot or cold?
Oh No.
So this is a little pun here.

500
00:32:22.340 --> 00:32:27.140
It's Aho and no,
right?
Cause this is the chemistry they were doing at that time.

501
00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:31.700
Making diammonium things and converting one thing to another.
Okay.

502
00:32:31.701 --> 00:32:36.701
So suppose what you want to do is convert Tallinn into one three,

503
00:32:37.220 --> 00:32:41.720
five try methyl.
What's the problem?

504
00:32:43.490 --> 00:32:46.400
Just do Friedel crafts and put methyl groups on,
right?

505
00:32:48.150 --> 00:32:49.140
<v 1>What's wrong with that?</v>

506
00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:55.340
<v 0>The alcohol groups,
our Ortho para directing.
You won't get this isomer.</v>

507
00:32:56.120 --> 00:33:01.010
Okay.
But what you can do if you,
so if you get,
if you try that,
it's got to fail,

508
00:33:02.630 --> 00:33:06.980
but you could put Nitro Groupon in the Para position,
right?

509
00:33:06.981 --> 00:33:11.810
We already talked about that kind of thing was chlorine instead of methyl as an

510
00:33:11.811 --> 00:33:14.990
Ortho para director.
And now what we're going to do,

511
00:33:16.370 --> 00:33:20.060
it's we've got not only the wrong group nitro instead of methyl,

512
00:33:20.061 --> 00:33:21.710
but we got it in the wrong place,

513
00:33:23.950 --> 00:33:25.360
<v 1>right?
But</v>

514
00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:29.820
<v 0>this is an indirect synthesis.
Notice what you can do is reduce it,</v>

515
00:33:30.150 --> 00:33:31.620
the nitro to a mean,

516
00:33:32.550 --> 00:33:36.060
and now you could react that or if it's too reactive,

517
00:33:36.540 --> 00:33:37.890
remember that the uh,

518
00:33:38.140 --> 00:33:42.390
the rocket fuel was nitration of something like that.

519
00:33:42.950 --> 00:33:46.980
You could acetyle to the fest necessary.
I don't know whether it would be,

520
00:33:47.730 --> 00:33:50.250
and now you do the free crafts reaction.

521
00:33:50.670 --> 00:33:54.180
Right now this is Ortho para directing methyl.

522
00:33:54.181 --> 00:33:58.700
So it would tend to put it here or here,
but this is more strongly Ortho,

523
00:33:58.710 --> 00:34:03.120
para directing because of the unshared pair and it would put it here or here.

524
00:34:03.270 --> 00:34:06.570
Right?
So it's a stronger Ortho para director.

525
00:34:06.610 --> 00:34:11.220
The methyl is that unshared pair,
right?
So it goes to there.

526
00:34:13.620 --> 00:34:16.230
So now you have that Nh two group there.

527
00:34:16.380 --> 00:34:20.040
So we've got the methyls where we want them,
but we got an Nh two.

528
00:34:20.041 --> 00:34:21.270
What are you going to do about that?

529
00:34:25.270 --> 00:34:30.160
What do we convert in age too?
What did the people in 1898 s do?

530
00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:35.440
They treated it with h o n o make the dye odium salt.

531
00:34:37.170 --> 00:34:38.003
<v 1>Right?</v>

532
00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:44.280
<v 0>And then react that with hypo fos for us acid to convert it to hydrogen.</v>

533
00:34:45.490 --> 00:34:46.323
Right?

534
00:34:46.450 --> 00:34:51.450
So the not the nitro that then the Amino group was put on in order to direct

535
00:34:52.781 --> 00:34:56.050
where other things are going and then you have to take it off again.

536
00:34:56.710 --> 00:35:01.150
So there was a utility to removing it with hydrogen.
Okay.

537
00:35:01.151 --> 00:35:06.151
Now here's the problem for you to work on how to make Para Denitra benzene.

538
00:35:08.930 --> 00:35:11.750
Okay.
With three h with three actions that we know about here.

539
00:35:11.930 --> 00:35:13.550
So you could work on that on your own.

540
00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:15.960
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

541
00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:17.510
<v 0>Now here's an interesting react,</v>

542
00:35:17.540 --> 00:35:22.230
a compound to four die nitrile flouro benzene.
Right?

543
00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:27.680
And the interesting thing about that one is it reacts with an amine to replace

544
00:35:28.441 --> 00:35:33.120
fluorine by the amine.
So this is an aromatic substitution,

545
00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:36.360
but it's different from the ones we've been talking about.

546
00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:41.340
Can you see why it's not like the electrophilic aromatic substitution that we've

547
00:35:41.341 --> 00:35:45.780
been talking about?
What makes the nitrogen reactive?
Arvin.

548
00:35:46.250 --> 00:35:47.040
Okay.

549
00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:49.630
<v 1>What makes the nitrogen reactive of the meat?</v>

550
00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:56.010
It has a partially negative,

551
00:35:57.910 --> 00:36:00.970
<v 0>well it's a,
it's a little negative recharge,
but that what's its high homo,</v>

552
00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:03.050
<v 1>uh,
not that I'm sure.</v>

553
00:36:03.250 --> 00:36:06.160
<v 0>Unshared pair.
Okay.
So that's what's gonna make it reactive.</v>

554
00:36:06.430 --> 00:36:11.430
So it can now we have nucleo fillic aromatic substitution instead of the things

555
00:36:12.371 --> 00:36:14.620
we've been talking before,
our plus reagents,

556
00:36:14.621 --> 00:36:17.950
cl plus carbon plus an Otu plus.

557
00:36:18.130 --> 00:36:20.980
This is hi homo instead of a low Lumo.

558
00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:25.840
And now that product actually is important.
I make it yellow because,

559
00:36:26.170 --> 00:36:29.110
because it was used when you do chromatography,

560
00:36:29.350 --> 00:36:34.000
if you spray it with this stuff where the means are,
will turn yellow,
right?

561
00:36:34.030 --> 00:36:38.990
So we'll,
uh,
it,
uh,
so it was,
it's a good visualization reagent,
right?

562
00:36:39.610 --> 00:36:44.200
And it identifies the amino acid at the end of the chain because if you put this

563
00:36:44.201 --> 00:36:46.060
on the,
uh,
on the chain where the,

564
00:36:46.061 --> 00:36:50.620
the end of the chain where there's Nh two and then Cleveland apart,

565
00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:53.500
right?
And see what the pieces are.

566
00:36:53.830 --> 00:36:58.180
The one that's yellow is the one that was on the end of the chain.
Okay.

567
00:36:58.750 --> 00:37:03.750
So this stuff was called Sanger's reagent after Frederick Sanger who used it to

568
00:37:04.061 --> 00:37:07.270
determine the amino acid sequence of insulin.
In fact,

569
00:37:07.271 --> 00:37:09.220
he invented this way of doing it,

570
00:37:09.500 --> 00:37:14.500
putting this color label on and [inaudible] he sent us a sequenced insulin in

571
00:37:16.121 --> 00:37:21.121
1955 and then three years later he got the Nobel prize for this sang or did,

572
00:37:23.140 --> 00:37:26.230
uh,
incidentally,
uh,

573
00:37:26.260 --> 00:37:28.150
how would you sequence,

574
00:37:28.180 --> 00:37:31.570
how do people sequence know the sequence of proteins nowadays?

575
00:37:31.571 --> 00:37:33.790
Do they do it this way?
You know?

576
00:37:35.130 --> 00:37:35.590
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

577
00:37:35.590 --> 00:37:37.930
<v 0>How do people know what the sequence of proteins are going to be?</v>

578
00:37:39.250 --> 00:37:43.330
They do it by sequencing the nucleic acid.
Right?
And in fact,

579
00:37:43.570 --> 00:37:47.980
Sanger got the 1980 Nobel prize for s for sequencing DNA.

580
00:37:47.981 --> 00:37:50.440
So we got two Nobel prize for they sequence city.

581
00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:52.900
But this clever thing that he has a good chemist,

582
00:37:52.901 --> 00:37:56.890
he figured out how to do is nuclear fillic aromatic substitution.

583
00:37:56.891 --> 00:38:01.030
Now how is it well designed this reagent to do that?
Well,

584
00:38:01.031 --> 00:38:05.440
for one thing it's yellow.
The product is yellow.
But another one is that this,

585
00:38:05.441 --> 00:38:09.850
an eye on that you get by is very good because it's got a nitro group where the

586
00:38:09.950 --> 00:38:12.040
charges right or there.

587
00:38:12.310 --> 00:38:16.060
So it's activated for forming that intermediate by two nitro groups.

588
00:38:16.210 --> 00:38:19.420
Then you'll lose the proton and then you lose fluoride.

589
00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:22.113
Okay,

590
00:38:22.870 --> 00:38:27.870
so the normal electrophilic aromatic substitution x plus comes on forming and

591
00:38:28.171 --> 00:38:32.770
the intermediate with plus plus plus,
and then h plus leaves.
Now,
uh,

592
00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:37.270
something minus comes on or a high homo,
the amine,

593
00:38:37.540 --> 00:38:41.290
right minus,
minus,
minus,
and then f minus goes away.

594
00:38:41.470 --> 00:38:44.140
Now why was f such a good thing to choose?

595
00:38:46.540 --> 00:38:49.570
Because f generally is not such a great leaving group.

596
00:38:49.600 --> 00:38:52.150
The other halogens are better as leaving groups.

597
00:38:53.410 --> 00:38:58.330
It's good because the leaving is not the rate determining step of this thing.

598
00:38:58.750 --> 00:39:01.270
The slow step is that initial edition.

599
00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:05.500
So the more electron withdrawing the comp substituent is,

600
00:39:05.560 --> 00:39:09.220
the better it will be.
So fluoride is the one to use.

601
00:39:09.910 --> 00:39:12.030
So it's activated by fluorine.
So Sanger,

602
00:39:12.040 --> 00:39:16.390
a great chemists figured out a good reagent and got rewarded with a Nobel prize.

603
00:39:16.391 --> 00:39:18.100
In fact,
two Nobel prizes.

604
00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:23.650
Now another place this crops up is in Nad plus,

605
00:39:23.651 --> 00:39:28.120
which is this compound.
Have you heard of Nad?
Plus Nadh?
Some of you,

606
00:39:28.210 --> 00:39:30.880
you will when you take bio chemistry,
if you haven't heard about it yet.

607
00:39:31.180 --> 00:39:34.180
These are oxidizing reducing agents.
Okay,

608
00:39:34.181 --> 00:39:38.290
so you have say an alcohol with a secondary alcohol.

609
00:39:38.291 --> 00:39:43.110
So you have an h there and now you can do uh,
an electro fill,

610
00:39:43.140 --> 00:39:45.550
a nuclear fillic aromatic substitution.

611
00:39:45.550 --> 00:39:50.290
Notice what's going on to the Benzie is h with the electrons,

612
00:39:50.291 --> 00:39:52.690
h minus,
right?

613
00:39:52.930 --> 00:39:57.460
It's helped out by the unshared pair on oxygen coming in here,
right?

614
00:39:57.580 --> 00:40:01.330
And this then is a good place to put the electrons on the Asian.

615
00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:04.420
So you get a ketone that it got oxidized.

616
00:40:04.750 --> 00:40:08.200
And this Nad h right now,

617
00:40:08.201 --> 00:40:10.900
the nice thing is that this is reversible.

618
00:40:11.140 --> 00:40:14.530
The energies of these two are closely enough balance that you can run it

619
00:40:14.531 --> 00:40:17.920
backwards and forwards.
That means this reagent can,

620
00:40:17.950 --> 00:40:22.950
can be used either nad plus can be used as an oxidizing reagent and a d h could

621
00:40:23.201 --> 00:40:24.670
be used as a reducing agent.

622
00:40:24.671 --> 00:40:28.600
So you could make a alcohol into a ketone or ketone into an alcohol.

623
00:40:28.990 --> 00:40:33.280
And this is a,
these are key molecules in biological oxidation and reduction.

624
00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:37.270
And notice the way they do it is by transferring h minus,

625
00:40:37.271 --> 00:40:39.700
accepting or giving back h minus.

626
00:40:39.730 --> 00:40:43.330
So that's that nuclear fillic aromatic substitution.

627
00:40:44.740 --> 00:40:47.740
So Ben Zelig reactivity,
uh,

628
00:40:48.680 --> 00:40:53.650
was related to PKA.
We looked already remember what's the Pka of normal alkanes,

629
00:40:53.651 --> 00:40:57.010
roughly the how acidic is our h,

630
00:40:57.910 --> 00:40:59.770
just a regular old alkane,
roughly

631
00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:05.050
50 something 50.
Phew.
Okay.

632
00:41:06.190 --> 00:41:09.400
But if you have al Willick Age,
it's 43.

633
00:41:09.401 --> 00:41:14.080
So it's something like seven powers of 10 or nine kilocalories better than a

634
00:41:14.081 --> 00:41:18.490
normal Al Kill Group because of Alec Stabilization.

635
00:41:18.880 --> 00:41:23.650
If you have fennel instead of vinyl,
instead of the carbon carbon double bond,

636
00:41:23.651 --> 00:41:25.090
it's even two powers,

637
00:41:25.410 --> 00:41:28.750
two powers of 10 butter or 12 kilocalories per mole.

638
00:41:29.110 --> 00:41:33.860
And if you have two phenol groups on it,
die fennel,
methane,
it's much better.

639
00:41:33.861 --> 00:41:36.080
It's another 11 kilocalories.
Better,

640
00:41:36.081 --> 00:41:39.980
not quite as good as the first one because the first,

641
00:41:40.010 --> 00:41:43.250
because there is not as high a homo anymore,

642
00:41:43.820 --> 00:41:47.570
once one has begun to lower it,
so there's a little bit less.

643
00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:49.850
What are you gonna predict what it's going to be?

644
00:41:50.060 --> 00:41:52.430
If you put three phenol groups on,

645
00:41:54.460 --> 00:41:55.050
<v 1>yeah,</v>

646
00:41:55.050 --> 00:41:58.480
<v 0>Luke,
you look ready to go on making a prediction here.</v>

647
00:42:00.070 --> 00:42:03.490
Pardon me?
How many Kilo Calvin's another 10.

648
00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:06.850
<v 1>It's three.</v>

649
00:42:08.670 --> 00:42:11.700
<v 0>The third one doesn't,
does hardly anything.
Why?</v>

650
00:42:12.630 --> 00:42:17.400
Because it's so crowded that the phenols have to twist and don't overlap very

651
00:42:17.401 --> 00:42:21.520
well.
Right?
So steric hindrance in Tryfan fennel methyl,
uh,

652
00:42:21.540 --> 00:42:26.160
reduces the overlap with the or the anti and you want to stabilize.

653
00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:31.110
So it reduces it by 25% from,
from Dai Fennel Bethel.
Okay.

654
00:42:31.111 --> 00:42:34.290
So,
so the crowding is an important thing.

655
00:42:34.410 --> 00:42:38.400
And this brings us to Moses Gomberg and the trifle methyl radical,

656
00:42:38.670 --> 00:42:43.470
which is 110 years old.
This academic year.
It was announced in October,

657
00:42:43.770 --> 00:42:46.980
uh,
1900,
right?
So October,

658
00:42:46.981 --> 00:42:51.330
we were already underway in this class.
Okay.

659
00:42:51.331 --> 00:42:56.331
So Moses Gum Berg was a speaker when this building was dedicated in 1923.

660
00:42:56.581 --> 00:42:58.080
One of the featured speakers,

661
00:42:58.410 --> 00:43:03.360
but he came from a very different background from crafts.
Remember crafts was,

662
00:43:03.400 --> 00:43:04.230
uh,
uh,

663
00:43:04.230 --> 00:43:08.730
was the son of an industrialist in Boston and could afford to go 17 years to

664
00:43:08.731 --> 00:43:11.040
Paris to do is research.
Right?

665
00:43:11.370 --> 00:43:13.920
But Gomberg was born in the Ukraine.

666
00:43:13.921 --> 00:43:18.300
He was Jewish and his father got in political trouble and there were pogroms

667
00:43:18.301 --> 00:43:21.600
going on.
So he and he and uh,
and uh,

668
00:43:22.170 --> 00:43:27.170
and Moses left and came to Chicago where Moses as a boy,

669
00:43:27.420 --> 00:43:28.650
he was born in 66.

670
00:43:28.651 --> 00:43:33.600
So here he's 18 years old and he's working in the stockyards in Chicago for two

671
00:43:33.601 --> 00:43:38.100
years,
but then somehow he gets to the University of Michigan two years later.

672
00:43:38.520 --> 00:43:41.730
Right.
And here's his transcript from the University of Michigan.

673
00:43:41.731 --> 00:43:45.690
He graduated in 1890.
So let's look at what he,

674
00:43:45.720 --> 00:43:49.710
what kind of thing you would have taken if you were getting a bs in chemistry,

675
00:43:49.711 --> 00:43:53.610
as it says up here at Michigan in 1890.
Okay.

676
00:43:53.611 --> 00:43:56.280
There were distribution classes,
right?

677
00:43:56.640 --> 00:44:01.350
So he took French rhetoric,
logic and psychology,
right.

678
00:44:02.250 --> 00:44:07.110
And then these are science classes,
physics and math.
Right.

679
00:44:07.830 --> 00:44:12.540
And here are chemistry related classes.
They're metallurgy,
scientific,

680
00:44:12.541 --> 00:44:13.590
freehand,
hand drawing,

681
00:44:13.591 --> 00:44:17.910
geology and mineralogy and chemical literature in German and French.

682
00:44:18.270 --> 00:44:21.810
And the big one in the middle,
not too surprisingly,
is chemistry.

683
00:44:22.510 --> 00:44:23.560
<v 1>Okay.
Okay.</v>

684
00:44:23.930 --> 00:44:27.800
<v 0>So the distribution wasn't quite what it is here nowadays.
Okay.</v>

685
00:44:28.130 --> 00:44:30.710
And here he is a student in the analytical.

686
00:44:32.250 --> 00:44:35.610
Now he,
after his freshman year,

687
00:44:35.611 --> 00:44:39.360
he Everage nine and a half chemistry labs a week.

688
00:44:40.200 --> 00:44:42.600
That's labs,
not hours in lab,

689
00:44:43.230 --> 00:44:47.200
nine and a half different lab sessions a week.
Right.

690
00:44:49.170 --> 00:44:53.790
And two thirds of the more analytical chemistry.
Right.
That's where,

691
00:44:53.791 --> 00:44:56.670
that's what he's doing.
He's doing a titration here.
Okay.

692
00:44:58.050 --> 00:45:01.140
So there was no spectroscopy then.
Okay.

693
00:45:01.710 --> 00:45:05.130
Then he went after he graduated and got his phd,
he was,

694
00:45:05.131 --> 00:45:08.160
I think the second phd in chemistry at the University of Michigan.

695
00:45:08.340 --> 00:45:10.050
And it's interesting that he studied chemistry.

696
00:45:10.051 --> 00:45:13.440
You might think as an immigrant with,
you know,
who had worked in the stockyards,

697
00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:18.270
he would be trying to do some practical,
uh,
uh,
work.
Right?

698
00:45:18.510 --> 00:45:22.530
So they're in this,
in this three year period when he was an undergraduate,

699
00:45:22.770 --> 00:45:27.090
there were,
I think something like 250,
uh,
or no,

700
00:45:27.091 --> 00:45:30.420
400 graduates in pharmacy from,

701
00:45:30.550 --> 00:45:35.370
from Michigan and about five in chemistry.
And he took chemistry.

702
00:45:35.490 --> 00:45:39.540
So that's very interesting.
But anyhow,
then he went to learn in,
in Germany,

703
00:45:39.541 --> 00:45:44.370
in Munich with buyer.
So there's buyer 61,
the head of the lab.

704
00:45:44.670 --> 00:45:49.670
And here's his assistant Tila who was 31 and here's Richard Ville Stutter,

705
00:45:51.180 --> 00:45:56.180
who got to know who is 24 then the fair haired boy in the lab who got the Nobel

706
00:45:56.190 --> 00:46:00.240
Prize in 1920 it's an organic chemist and here's Moses Gomberg.

707
00:46:00.540 --> 00:46:05.220
He's 30 years old,
older because of his family history than these other people.

708
00:46:05.221 --> 00:46:10.210
Almost as old as Tila.
Right?
But here's what Ville statter.

709
00:46:10.230 --> 00:46:13.570
The Nobel laureate later said about it.
Moses Gomberg was teal,

710
00:46:13.571 --> 00:46:17.640
his coworker in the student laboratory.
He was very reserved and modest,

711
00:46:17.641 --> 00:46:21.420
kept entirely to himself and never chatted in or out of laboratory.

712
00:46:21.720 --> 00:46:22.740
Some years later,

713
00:46:22.741 --> 00:46:26.610
the work he carried out in the United States on the trifle methyl radical,

714
00:46:26.760 --> 00:46:31.050
a case of try Vaillant carbon became famous.
And you know what?

715
00:46:31.050 --> 00:46:33.930
I think the key phrases here

716
00:46:36.630 --> 00:46:41.610
in the United States,
because remember crafts work was done in France,

717
00:46:41.970 --> 00:46:46.140
right?
Nothing in the United States,
but here are just two decades later,

718
00:46:46.740 --> 00:46:50.160
right?
The key work is being done in the United States.

719
00:46:50.880 --> 00:46:53.580
So we're going to see how this happened.
This brilliant experiment,

720
00:46:53.850 --> 00:46:56.340
one of the most beautiful and organic chemistry in one,

721
00:46:56.341 --> 00:47:00.810
which few people credited at first gave great impetus to chemistry and have been

722
00:47:00.811 --> 00:47:04.770
worthy of any distinction.
So he was nominated that,
uh,
uh,

723
00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:08.010
Gomberg West for the Nobel prize a number of times,
but he never got it.

724
00:47:09.120 --> 00:47:12.240
Now how did he get into this?
Uh,
well,

725
00:47:12.390 --> 00:47:14.730
just before he got to the lab Tila,

726
00:47:14.731 --> 00:47:18.810
the guy in the front row who ultimately drank himself to death in France,

727
00:47:19.350 --> 00:47:23.190
uh,
had a student named Koisor who worked on this,

728
00:47:23.460 --> 00:47:28.030
who made this compound called Ai be n Aso,

729
00:47:28.030 --> 00:47:28.863
Iso Bureau night trial.

730
00:47:28.990 --> 00:47:33.580
And from it in 50% yield prepared a new carbon carbon bond.

731
00:47:33.790 --> 00:47:37.170
And this is a different way of making carbon carbon bonds.
Uh,

732
00:47:37.230 --> 00:47:39.640
the way you do it is to lose nitrogen.

733
00:47:39.641 --> 00:47:43.450
So end two comes out in the two radicals come together.
Okay.

734
00:47:44.410 --> 00:47:48.400
So when Goldberg came along into the lab for just,

735
00:47:48.440 --> 00:47:52.990
just a semester or maybe two semesters,
it was he,
uh,
he,
uh,

736
00:47:53.440 --> 00:47:57.640
said under the sponsorship of Professor Teal,
I followed up on these reactions.

737
00:47:57.641 --> 00:48:02.020
So he worked on this compound,
this idea of knocking nitrogen out.

738
00:48:02.440 --> 00:48:07.010
And then he went for the third term to Heidelberg to work with Victor Meyer,

739
00:48:07.440 --> 00:48:09.970
uh,
who had introduced the idea of steric hindrance.

740
00:48:09.971 --> 00:48:12.840
This was a stressful time to be in a,

741
00:48:13.060 --> 00:48:17.560
in Heidelberg because Meyer committed suicide during this,
this period.

742
00:48:19.180 --> 00:48:23.500
But a interesting question and steric hindrance was this tetra fennel,
methane.

743
00:48:23.770 --> 00:48:27.100
Remember Frito and crafts thought they had made Tetra fennel methane,

744
00:48:27.430 --> 00:48:32.320
but in fact they had made trifle methyl chloride,
right?
Because it's so crowded.

745
00:48:32.620 --> 00:48:36.730
So Friedel crafts wouldn't make it.
They tried with fennel and ions,

746
00:48:36.731 --> 00:48:41.650
fennel metal compounds to make Tetra fennel methane and they couldn't do it.

747
00:48:41.920 --> 00:48:44.020
So this was a real challenge.

748
00:48:44.021 --> 00:48:46.990
A grand challenge was how to make Tetra fennel methane.

749
00:48:47.170 --> 00:48:50.830
Not that anybody thought it would be good for anything,
but it was a symmetrical,

750
00:48:50.831 --> 00:48:53.770
beautiful compound.
And how do you make it okay?

751
00:48:54.220 --> 00:48:56.170
And Gomberg succeeded.

752
00:48:56.171 --> 00:48:59.260
I have tried to solve this problem in a completely different way.

753
00:48:59.620 --> 00:49:04.450
So the way he used those,
what he had learned the previous two terms in Munich.

754
00:49:05.220 --> 00:49:09.750
So in Heidelberg,
he tried making this compound,
which you get from Dias,

755
00:49:09.780 --> 00:49:11.630
odium benzine die,

756
00:49:11.640 --> 00:49:15.070
Azonian salt and try funnel methyl chloride.

757
00:49:15.071 --> 00:49:18.400
This stuff that Friedel crafts could make.
Okay.

758
00:49:19.300 --> 00:49:22.610
So we tried it to see if it would work and it's 110 degrees with,

759
00:49:22.720 --> 00:49:25.960
with copper there from eight grams of the starting material.

760
00:49:25.961 --> 00:49:30.850
He got 0.3 grams of this stuff,
right?
How does he know what it was?

761
00:49:31.240 --> 00:49:33.400
Well,
he discusses the Solubility,

762
00:49:33.401 --> 00:49:37.510
but that's not a very good key to what the compound is.
Right?

763
00:49:37.870 --> 00:49:42.870
But he did the analysis and this is what he found and this is the theoretical.

764
00:49:43.151 --> 00:49:47.110
So agreed very well with that.
And what else might you be able to do?

765
00:49:49.150 --> 00:49:53.110
The molecular weight would be very key.
And how do you get the molecular weight?

766
00:49:53.320 --> 00:49:57.130
You can get it from the vapor density,
but this has very low vapor pressure.

767
00:49:57.640 --> 00:50:01.540
Right?
But you can get it by freezing point lowering.
Right?

768
00:50:01.780 --> 00:50:05.860
So that's what he did.
He tried freezing point lowering.
He had a,
he used,

769
00:50:05.980 --> 00:50:10.330
he had 300 milligrams of this material and he used a hundred milligrams for this

770
00:50:10.331 --> 00:50:11.164
purpose.

771
00:50:11.200 --> 00:50:16.200
And he found that he lowered the melting point by 0.289 degrees.

772
00:50:17.320 --> 00:50:19.270
This is real careful work.

773
00:50:19.360 --> 00:50:24.360
He's being paid off for having spent nine and a half labs a week for three years

774
00:50:24.971 --> 00:50:27.920
at Michigan.
Okay,
so by solve,
Oh,

775
00:50:27.921 --> 00:50:31.130
is boiling point not freezing by the solvent boiling point elevation,

776
00:50:31.340 --> 00:50:36.320
which implied 306 for the molecular way that you calculate three 20 so very
good.

777
00:50:36.860 --> 00:50:39.260
So then he went back to Michigan to Anarbor.

778
00:50:39.290 --> 00:50:41.810
He stayed there the rest of his life.
Right?

779
00:50:41.840 --> 00:50:45.890
Working at the University of Michigan.
And what did he do when he get back?

780
00:50:46.190 --> 00:50:47.270
I'll tell you next time.
