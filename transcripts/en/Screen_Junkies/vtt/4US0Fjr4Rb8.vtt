00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:13.080
From 20th Century Fox comes a landmark of
science fiction filmmaking that’s still

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:16.000
one of the most shocking movies ever ma--

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.180
Wait, we’re doing the Tim Burton version?
Let’s just get this over with.

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:24.320
Planet of the Apes

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.280
Prepare for a reboot so disappointing, the
franchise was immediately de-booted, then

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.710
rebooted again ten years later.

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.190
Watch as the once visionary Tim Burton gives
a master-class in how not to reboot a franchise

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.250
as he attempts to set his film apart from
the 1968 classic by

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.720
repurposing old dialogue,

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:47.780
"Take your stinking hands off me, you damn
dirty human.”

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:48.610
repeating old dialogue,

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:54.010
“Damn them. Damn them all to hell.”

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.150
and trying to one up the original ending,
even though his makes absolutely no sense.

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.240
Huh?

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.899
When an air force captain abandons his orbital
monkey research station to follow his pet

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:12.310
chimp into an electrical storm...

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.649
Blah blah blah time travel...

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:15.859
Blah blah blah evil monkey society...

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:17.840
Blah blah blah uprising...

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:18.969
ancient monkey prophecy,

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:19.939
final battle,

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:21.469
and the creepiest kiss ever.

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:24.659
Trust me, you won’t remember the details
either.

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.479
Witness the hundred million dollar version
of Mark Wahlberg Talks to Animals,

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:33.670
"Alright, just follow your sequence and come
home. Understand?"

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.869
in his lowest point since his rap career

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:42.869
as he spends this entire terrible movie staring
at things,

00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:50.329
phoning it in,

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:51.359
"Where am I?"

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:54.119
"I was just here a few days ago."

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.379
and mouth-breathing.

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:09.620
But he’s not alone:

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.610
Marky Mark shares the screen with a whole
funky bunch of other actors, like

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.540
a bunch of humans we’re supposed to care
about, but don't,

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.580
Estella Warren’s dumb face,

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.680
a nd more Oscar nominees in monkey suits than
the Academy Awards.

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.590
"And the Oscar goes to…"

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:27.970
NOBODY!

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.790
So before you catch the sequel to the way
better reboot,

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.140
get ready to suffer through everything you
didn’t want from a Planet of the Apes movie,

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:36.180
featuring

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.150
political debates,

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.190
"The human problem cannot be solved by simply
throwing money at it."

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:45.780
"The government tried that once. And all we
got was a welfare state that nearly bankrupted

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:46.780
us."

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.650
monkey foreplay,

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.000
and apes

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:53.610
going

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.070
apesh*t.

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.860
"What do you know about my father?!"

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:22.580
"How the hell did these monkeys get like this?"

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:23.950
Starring...

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:25.710
Say Hi To Your Mother For Me

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:27.080
Bellapetrix Lestrange

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.340
Duhhhhhhhhh

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.600
(Michael Clarke) Dunston Checks In

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:32.790
Reservoir Chimp

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.910
A Monkey in a Paul Giamatti Suit

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:37.230
and Aperaham Lincoln

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.420
Planet of the Apes...

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.770
the bad one.

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:50.100
“Damn you! God damn you all to hell!”

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:51.780
Our thoughts exactly!
