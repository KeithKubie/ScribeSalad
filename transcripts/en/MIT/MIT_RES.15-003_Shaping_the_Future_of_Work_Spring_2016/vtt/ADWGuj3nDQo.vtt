00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:07.930
We're talking today about the
changes in the corporation

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:09.590
and, particularly,
about the role

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:13.300
that CEOs play in leading
American corporations.

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:16.140
We're fortunate to
have John Reed with us.

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:20.450
John is the former chairman
of Citicorp and Citibank,

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:23.380
and then after Citicorp
merged with Travelers,

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.180
he was the co-CEO
of the Citigroup.

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.680
Then, as an indication of the
level of respect the business

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:31.510
community has for
him, he was asked

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:34.310
to serve as chairman of
the New York Stock Exchange

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:37.310
from 2003 to 2005.

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:39.780
So John, thank you
for joining us.

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.660
Maybe, we could start just
by getting your perspective

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.410
on what is the role
of the corporation

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:47.920
in the American economy,
and, particularly,

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.760
the responsibilities of the CEO.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.580
The role of the corporation in
the US has changed quite a bit,

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:57.710
and I've witnessed
some of this change.

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:03.000
My own personal view is
businesses' responsibility

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.180
is to create customers,
satisfy the customer needs,

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:12.200
and do so in a way that produces
decent financial results

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.750
on an intermediate to
longer period of time.

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:19.110
And obviously, there
is a social role

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.900
for the institution itself.

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.070
You typically employ
a lot of people.

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.960
You invest in factories
or in office buildings

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.730
or what have you, and so you
become a part of the community.

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:33.100
And it's changed today.

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.800
This idea of
shareholder value tends

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:40.310
to define the role of the
company in economic terms.

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.540
Why do you think the
role of the corporation

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.310
has changed over the years?

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.080
I first became CEO in '84.

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.450
At that time, companies
were pretty well

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.410
run by the management.

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:55.820
The CEO was, obviously,
the key decision-maker,

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:00.780
but management was really the
controlling group, if you will.

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.160
I would say by maybe
15 years later,

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:08.370
the investors had taken control,
and they have a very different

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:10.229
set of objectives.

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.960
And I think what happened
is, first of all,

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.220
I think there was an
extended period of time when

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.930
stock market didn't
give very good returns.

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.010
There was pressure
from investors

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.170
to get better performance.

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:30.030
Somebody got the idea that, hey,
maybe we could scare companies

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.480
into doing better.

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.650
It started out with something
called greenmail, where

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.010
somebody would take a
position in a company,

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.850
maybe they'd own 5%,
6%, 7% of the company.

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:41.450
Then, they'd go
to the management,

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.070
and they'd say, look
guys, you really

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.190
have some divisions
that aren't performing.

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.440
You guys aren't on
top of your game,

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.780
and we want better
performance from you.

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.220
And if you don't, we're going
to lead some kind of shareholder

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:55.420
revolt.

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.790
Well, this took
hold, and managements

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.190
that tried to ignore this
got into trouble, often

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:04.070
were thrown out.

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:07.020
Boards were changed, and
pretty soon the shareholders

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:11.030
were in charge, and what they
said was: look management,

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.390
we don't care what
you pay yourself,

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:16.690
we don't care how many jets
you have flying around,

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.620
but we want the
value of the stock

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.020
to go up in a very nice way
and a very predictable way,

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:24.690
and we want it next quarter.

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.210
And by the way, it would be
nice if you would tell us,

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:31.480
in anticipation, what it is
you might be earning next year,

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.370
next quarter, so forth and
so on, something I never did.

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:36.730
We never in Citi,
during the time

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.740
I was there,
provided forecasts as

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:41.900
to what we were going
to earn the next quarter

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.840
or the next year because
they became targets,

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.470
which if you were one penny
off, the price of stock

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:50.160
would change.

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.790
Certainly, we understand the
focus is more on shareholders

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.780
and so on, but thinking about
the role of the corporation

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:59.690
in the broader economy and
society, what do you think

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:02.720
are some of the second and
third order consequences

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:03.470
of this change?

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:06.160
I think the biggest
consequence is

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.290
you're getting very short-term.

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:12.460
It's very difficult to spend
a lot of money training people

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:14.200
if you're worried
about next quarter.

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.120
You train people because you're
worrying about how they're

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.540
going to perform over an
extended period of time

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:21.760
makes that investment
well worthwhile,

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.190
but it's very easy
to cut if you're just

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:26.170
trying to hit a number.

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:29.450
And the other thing is
where before maybe you

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:33.310
kept a plant open that
maybe could be moved,

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:35.154
but you've been
in that community

00:04:35.154 --> 00:04:36.570
for a long period
of time, you had

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:39.260
a lot of workers who
were loyal to you,

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:40.990
and you were loyal to them.

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:44.447
Those decisions changed,
so all of a sudden you

00:04:44.447 --> 00:04:45.280
said: you know what?

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.400
We can't afford to keep this
plant even though it's not

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.780
really bad, it's just not
as good as it might be.

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:55.870
So it's eroded the relationships
both with community

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:58.110
and with employees.

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:01.550
Suppose we wanted to get a
re-balancing of the corporation

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:05.040
where it begins to address
some of these broader concerns

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.600
as well as the concerns
of shareholders.

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:10.380
Any thoughts on a path forward?

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:13.420
I think this is a
question of values.

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:17.600
A CEO can say,
look guys, I'm not

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:21.540
going to maximize returns over
the next two or three quarters,

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:25.260
but I am going to maximize
them over a period of time,

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:29.750
and just begin to
adjust expectations.

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:32.110
I think shareholder
value has a place,

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:35.620
but it is a factor
amongst two or three,

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:39.920
and I think the most important
thing is to expand this time

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:41.620
frame a little bit.

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:43.740
Don't say, hey, I'm
not interested in how

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:45.810
the stocks are going to
perform, but let's say,

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:48.350
I'm more interested in
how it's going to perform

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:50.440
over the next 18 months.

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:52.810
But the CEO is going
to have to give voice

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:55.930
to that, because if
the CEO doesn't change

00:05:55.930 --> 00:06:00.230
his or her conversation, it's
going to be very hard for lower

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:02.940
level people within
a company to start

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:06.110
taking a somewhat broader
and longer look at things.

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:08.820
We are in the
business here at MIT

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:13.160
of educating the next generation
of corporate leaders and CEOs.

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:15.580
What role do you
think institutions

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:18.320
like ours should play
in this whole process?

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:20.310
You have to get the
conversation going.

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:23.140
In other words, if people
come in and simply say,

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:25.530
hey, the only thing that
counts is shareholder value,

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:28.290
and they don't think about it,
and they don't talk about it,

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:31.490
and they don't say, well, what
are the implications of that?

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:33.980
Well, then, it's
like going to school

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:36.350
and saying the only thing
that counts is grades.

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:39.050
I'm just going to get my grades.

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:43.000
I think business schools here at
MIT, or other business schools,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.440
need to have the
conversation that says, hey,

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:48.220
there's shareholder value.

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:49.530
This is what it means.

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:50.890
This is what it brings.

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:52.950
Now, what are some
of the other values

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:56.080
that need to be thought about,
and what is the juxtaposition?

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:58.660
Because if you get the
conversation going,

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:03.970
then each manager as he or
she goes out into the world,

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:08.520
will begin to have a more
nuanced understanding of what

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:10.400
it is they're trying
to accomplish,

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:12.860
and they'll begin to
bring some balance.

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:13.980
Well, this is great John.

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:14.940
I really appreciate it.

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:16.770
Thank you.
