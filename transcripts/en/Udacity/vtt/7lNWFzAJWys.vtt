00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
[D. Evans] Now that you've written your first Python program,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
you might be wondering why we need to invent new languages like Python

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
to program computers and spend all the effort into learning a new language

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
rather than using some language like English or Mandarin that we already know.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
There are lots of reasons for that.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Natural languages like English or Mandarin are great for people who grew up speaking them

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
for day-to-day conversation,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
but there are many reasons that they wouldn't work well for programming computers.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
The first one is ambiguity.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Natural languages are inherently ambiguous.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Different people can interpret the same sentence to mean many different things.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
When we program computers, the computer needs to interpret that program,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
and we want to make sure that the computer interprets the program

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
the exact same way that the programmer who wrote the program

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
intends for it to be interpreted.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
So here's an example of the kinds of ambiguities that come up

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
in natural languages like English.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
We'll do this in the form of a quiz.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.000
The question is, Would you rather be paid $100 weekly or biweekly?

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
These are the choices:

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
You could prefer to be paid $100 weekly;

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
you could prefer to be paid $100 biweekly;

00:01:09.000 --> 99:59:59.000
it depends; or you're an altruist and you don't like to be paid at all.
