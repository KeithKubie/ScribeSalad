00:00:03.375 --> 00:00:06.425
So, the original "Star Wars" trilogy -- episodes IV,

00:00:06.425 --> 00:00:09.415
V, and VI -- has a total runtime of

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.800
 

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.580
Each movie is pretty much the same length: a little over

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.440
two hours, and they're also the same in another respect:

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:20.915
The amount of time that they feature the series' main villain,

00:00:20.915 --> 00:00:21.795
Darth Vader.

00:00:21.795 --> 00:00:23.725
In terms of actual screentime,

00:00:23.725 --> 00:00:26.505
Vader gets astonishingly little.

00:00:26.505 --> 00:00:29.485
In "A New Hope", he's in the film for only eight minutes.

00:00:29.485 --> 00:00:32.445
In "Empire Strikes Back", he's in it for twelve minutes.

00:00:32.445 --> 00:00:36.920
And in "Return of the Jedi", he tops out at about fourteen minutes onscreen.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.760
Put these all together, and Darth Vader

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.380
Maybe cinema's most iconic villain, if not character in general

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:46.640
flashed across movie screens for a total of only

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:52.520
In this video, I want to take a look at Vader's visual footprint in the original trilogy

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.700
to see if we can't locate what gives him this

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.000
iconic status in such a short time.

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:01.155
In Episode IV,  Darth Vader is only in six percent of the movie,

00:01:01.155 --> 00:01:04.265
and his scenes are striking in how the character

00:01:04.265 --> 00:01:06.120
fades into the background,

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.120
both narratively and visually.

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.340
For the bulk of Episode IV, Vader is portrayed as

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.980
the subordinate of Grand Moff Tarkin.

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:17.320
So, a good portion of his screentime has him in the background

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.280
Or off to the side, cut off, sometimes

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.020
out of focus.

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:22.820
Even when he's being filmed directly

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.520
Vader's black uniform fades into the shadows of the set,

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.820
and there is a noticeable lack of separation between

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:30.440
foreground and background.

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.440
Now, it's hard to say how much of this is a narrative

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.900
or thematic choice, and how much

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.740
is down to the constraints of filming.

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.420
All of Darth Vader's scenes in Episode IV --

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.220
With the exception of the first --

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.315
Take place in or around the Death Star.

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.500
Gilbert Taylor, the cinematographer,

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.460
was famously annoyed with filming these scenes

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.635
because he didn't like the black and grey sets made

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.580
by John Barry, which provided little opportunity

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.020
for targeted lighting.

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.400
Taylor was actually forced to cut holes in the sets

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.415
and outfit them with quartz lamps

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.880
that lit the environment evenly for flexibility in shooting.

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.540
Flexibility, but not specificity.

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.905
This is not to say that Darth Vader

00:02:08.905 --> 00:02:10.680
doesn't make an impact in Episode IV

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.235
I mean, this is the film that

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:13.720
launched the whole thing.

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.500
And visually, the movie does make a bold statement out of the gate

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.820
by introducing Vader right away

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.860
as a menacing, jet-black presence against

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.000
the white interior walls of the Rebel spaceship.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.940
But I do think that there's more iconic Vader imagery to come.

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.400
You see that right away in Episode V,

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:33.660
"The Empire Strikes Back"

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.215
The first time Vader appears onscreen,

00:02:36.215 --> 00:02:38.945
you get this iconic helmet shot from behind.

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.600
What's so cool about this shot is that it's essentially

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:42.720
black on black.

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.480
And yet, director Irvin Kershner and cinematographer

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.720
Peter Suschitzky find a way to make Vader stand out

00:02:48.725 --> 00:02:51.865
with reflections and texture and shape.

00:02:52.115 --> 00:02:55.105
All throughout the film, they find ways to key into the

00:02:55.105 --> 00:02:58.165
elemental quality of Vader as an archetype

00:02:58.165 --> 00:02:59.920
or representation of evil.

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.780
And they up the ante on the work done in Episode IV.

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:07.640
In that movie, Vader's helmet --for example-- is dirty, smudged, used.

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.260
This might have something to do with Lucas's desire

00:03:10.265 --> 00:03:12.195
to have a naturalistic, documentary

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.560
feel to the movie, something he often argued about with

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:15.500
Gil Taylor.

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.920
But in "Empire", the helmet is as smooth as volcanic glass

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.080
and always spotlessly clean so that it features these

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:26.495
fat, white reflections which highlight its shape.

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.780
Kershner and Suschitzky seem to understand that

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.840
visually, Vader increased in dramatic weight

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.655
the less naturalistic and more pure that he seemed.

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:37.760
After all, the most iconic symbols in our culture

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.300
are the ones that can be boiled down to their basic shape

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.580
and still be instantaneously recognizable.

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:47.400
Episode V takes advantage of this with the masterful use of silhouette.

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.740
It's in these moments that Vader transcends his role

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:53.140
as a character in a movie and becomes

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:55.160
a symbol for something much deeper.

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:57.580
...and much more universal.

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.400
"The Empire Strikes Back", I think is inventive

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.635
with its Darth Vader imagery in a way that

00:04:03.635 --> 00:04:06.025
both of the other films aren't as much.

00:04:06.085 --> 00:04:09.055
With only twelve minutes of screen time, the filmmakers

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.280
do a lot to add to the mystique of the character,

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.180
and the film features those images of Vader that have

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:17.920
seared themselves onto my mind from the very first time I watched it.

00:04:18.035 --> 00:04:20.785
Episode VI: "Return of the Jedi"

00:04:20.785 --> 00:04:23.420
largely holds onto that pristine look from "Empire",

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:26.220
even copies some of the "Empire" shots exactly.

00:04:26.445 --> 00:04:28.035
But overall, "Jedi" is

00:04:28.035 --> 00:04:30.875
less inspired when it comes to Darth Vader cinematography.

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.320
He often looks flat against backgrounds, and

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:36.080
the framing and lighting isn't nearly as compelling

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.680
as Kershner's work on Episode V.

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.340
Kershner was so devoted to his own vision that

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:44.300
he didn't shoot master shots, which meant that Lucas

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:48.140
would have to edit the scenes roughly how Kershner intended them.

00:04:48.325 --> 00:04:51.535
By most accounts, Lucas hired Richard Marquand as a sort of

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:53.740
"working man's director" for Episode VI,

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:57.140
somebody who could bring the film in on time and within budget

00:04:57.145 --> 00:05:00.145
*and* give Lucas enough options to construct

00:05:00.145 --> 00:05:01.380
the film in the edit.

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:04.640
As a result, Episode VI lacks the character work that was a signature

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:06.540
of Kershner's style.

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:09.280
What "Jedi" does give us is that famous final scene,

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.560
where Darth Vader is finally unmasked.

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:14.980
It's a moment that brings the archetype down to earth.

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:18.380
The actual face of evil is just the face of a broken man.

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:22.700
More pathetic than anything, and in that way deeply human.

00:05:22.885 --> 00:05:25.905
Of course, the legacy of Darth Vader isn't all in the visuals.

00:05:25.905 --> 00:05:29.400
The writing, costume, and James Earl Jones' vocal performance

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:32.200
contribute hugely to the character's continued fame

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:34.260
even his breathing is iconic.

00:05:35.035 --> 00:05:37.775
But film is a visual medium, and when all

00:05:37.775 --> 00:05:40.715
these things are wrapped in the right image

00:05:40.715 --> 00:05:42.765
the effect can be mythic.

00:05:43.315 --> 00:05:46.275
What's amazing is that Lucas and Kershner achieved

00:05:46.275 --> 00:05:49.115
this in just a handful of minutes,

00:05:49.115 --> 00:05:50.115
and the impact...

00:05:50.275 --> 00:05:51.475
speaks for itself.

00:06:01.725 --> 00:06:04.765
