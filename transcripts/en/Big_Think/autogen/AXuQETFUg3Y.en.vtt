front on energy technology everybody in

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360
front on energy technology everybody in
 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.450
front on energy technology everybody in
the world would be following the same

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460

renewable energy people would have would

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229
renewable energy people would have would
 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.350
renewable energy people would have would
embrace that culture and use renewable

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360
embrace that culture and use renewable
 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.990

energy the biggest news in science this

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000
energy the biggest news in science this
 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.499
energy the biggest news in science this
year for me was the US which is the

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509
year for me was the US which is the
 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.930
year for me was the US which is the
world leader in all this energy burning

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940
world leader in all this energy burning
 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:12.620
world leader in all this energy burning
of

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630
of
 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.280
of
also fuel burning and and using a lot of

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290
also fuel burning and and using a lot of
 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.200
also fuel burning and and using a lot of
energy per person the u.s. now has 53

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.210
energy per person the u.s. now has 53
 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:22.940
energy per person the u.s. now has 53
percent of our population who believe

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950
percent of our population who believe
 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.970
percent of our population who believe
that humans are causing climate change

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980
that humans are causing climate change
 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.220
that humans are causing climate change
so 53 percent is enough to get elected

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230
so 53 percent is enough to get elected
 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:28.970
so 53 percent is enough to get elected
president

president
 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.900
president
and so maybe climate change will be an

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910
and so maybe climate change will be an
 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:34.520
and so maybe climate change will be an
