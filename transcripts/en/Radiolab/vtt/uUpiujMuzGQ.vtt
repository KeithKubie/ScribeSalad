1
00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.280
Ready, but what am I supposed to do? I don't have to do anything. Right.

2
00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.070
This is Radiolab. I'm Jad up. I'm Ron and I'm Robert Krulwich.

3
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.080
And today we're talking about aging. Yep.

4
00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:11.270
Thank you ever wonder why it is that that human beings live. Um,

5
00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.270
like what, how long do we live? About 70 years roughly. Something like that.

6
00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:15.431
Yeah.

7
00:00:15.431 --> 00:00:20.431
So why 70 as opposed to seven or like 700?

8
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.140
[inaudible] why that number? Well, that's, no,

9
00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:24.810
that's a good question because every,

10
00:00:24.811 --> 00:00:29.100
apparently every creature has for some reason a sort of natural range.

11
00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.250
So you want to hear very cool one. Um,

12
00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.130
how about a rat got a rat in your head

13
00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.190
and a squirrel? The rat in the squirrel here you have two animals. People call.

14
00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.520
Oh, I have friends who call squirrels tree rats.

15
00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.520
That's Cynthia Kenyon from the University of California, San Francisco.

16
00:00:47.521 --> 00:00:48.780
I recently paid her a visit.

17
00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:51.160
<v 1>You know, th some of the ways they're very similar to each other.</v>

18
00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:55.990
They're rodents, but a rat has a three year lifespan,

19
00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.350
whereas a squirrel has a 25 year lifespan

20
00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:06.610
and no one knows why. Really? There are theories, but no one really knows why.

21
00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.830
I got the idea that maybe somehow lifespan was evolvable in the sense that there

22
00:01:11.831 --> 00:01:13.810
might be genes in the animal,

23
00:01:13.811 --> 00:01:17.900
which when change allow big leaps in lifespan to take place.

24
00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.950
We figured that you could just hunt the genes down. Exactly,

25
00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.100
and this is exactly what she seems to have done,

26
00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:27.430
but not with rats and squirrels. What did I show you?

27
00:01:27.431 --> 00:01:31.250
The incubator where we keep all the worms. Little roundworms, yes,

28
00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:35.800
called the c elegans. Actually you can't see them with a naked eye.

29
00:01:35.801 --> 00:01:38.560
They're just a little speck. But when you put them under a microscope,

30
00:01:38.561 --> 00:01:39.670
you see how beautiful they are.

31
00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:46.630
So first I'm showing you here the normal warm when it's a young adult and what

32
00:01:46.631 --> 00:01:51.360
you can see is it's very active and it's healthy looking all the way in the

33
00:01:51.361 --> 00:01:54.550
dishes as Wharton's looking great. Moving from that, it's a wiggle.

34
00:01:54.551 --> 00:01:56.650
It was really nicely. Okay,

35
00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:00.060
now let's fast forward two weeks.

36
00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:05.500
Then she showed us eight different set of words in a different day.

37
00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.180
These worms were 13 days, day 13 of adulthood.

38
00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.540
They only live to 14 just live two weeks here at the very,

39
00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.900
very end of their lives. And what we see here as a dead one,

40
00:02:15.901 --> 00:02:19.590
so one has already died and another one that's clearly in the nursing home,

41
00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:23.670
just lying, still not moving at all. And you can tell immediately that it's old,

42
00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.840
it looks kind of wrinkled and lethargic and even if you've never seen a worm

43
00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.100
ever, you can tell that one is old. So there you go. You've got a young worm,

44
00:02:32.101 --> 00:02:32.940
you have an old woman.

45
00:02:32.941 --> 00:02:36.600
Essentially what Cynthia Kenyon is trying to do is she's trying to hunt down the

46
00:02:36.601 --> 00:02:41.601
gene that could turn that old worm backwards in time and make it look like a

47
00:02:43.051 --> 00:02:47.400
young word. The worms have about 20,000 genes. So the idea is really simple.

48
00:02:47.401 --> 00:02:51.180
You just go and change genes at random one by one,

49
00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:54.810
one at a time and see whether any of these gene changes can extend life span.

50
00:02:54.811 --> 00:02:57.540
How long did it take you to bump into a good one? Well,

51
00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:02.200
we actually were lucky to find a gene pretty quickly and we found that if we

52
00:03:02.201 --> 00:03:04.870
change this one gene called Daf too,

53
00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:07.900
if we change this one gene called Daf too,

54
00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.540
then the worms live twice as long as as they normally do,

55
00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:14.670
<v 2>just like pretty much by sheer luck,</v>

56
00:03:14.671 --> 00:03:19.671
she taken this worm and stretched lifespan for 14 days all the way out to about

57
00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:24.570
28 days. Just 28 yeah. It doesn't sound like a lot to you,

58
00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:25.590
but to where I'm next

59
00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:29.920
<v 1>[inaudible] wait, can you tell me like w w when you ran into it,</v>

60
00:03:29.921 --> 00:03:33.060
did you do like a little war dance around the laboratory? Where you at? Yeah,

61
00:03:33.061 --> 00:03:34.830
it was amazing. I mean it was incredible.

62
00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.790
I had a person in my lab who said deaf too is magic and she's right.

63
00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.070
Okay. I'm going to show you these magic worms,

64
00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.620
which are exactly the same as the normal worms,

65
00:03:44.621 --> 00:03:46.930
except that we've changed one gene, the def two gene,

66
00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.860
so remember that old wrinkly worm that we saw before? Yeah.

67
00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:54.250
The whim she's about to show me is the same age as that 13 day old.

68
00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:56.740
Were you the old way. Okay. And it's bolting out of,

69
00:03:56.741 --> 00:04:00.790
it's bolting into the picture here. It looks young, it's moving.

70
00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:06.010
It's very healthy. It's active. And actually if you take a microscope,

71
00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:07.540
then you look at the tissues,

72
00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:09.610
what you see as the tissues of the warm look young.

73
00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:12.790
If you just look at that,

74
00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.640
you just sit there and you just look at it and look at it and look at it and

75
00:04:15.641 --> 00:04:19.120
just let it sink in. What it means. It's really amazing.

76
00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:20.980
It's really a very deep and fundamental.

77
00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:26.910
You're looking at something that I guess wasn't supposed to happen in some funny

78
00:04:28.091 --> 00:04:29.380
way. There was supposed to die.

79
00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:33.540
<v 3>No,</v>

80
00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:36.480
<v 1>sure. What exactly is this gene doing to make them live longer? Well,</v>

81
00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:37.530
maybe we should ask,

82
00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:40.620
ask the question a different way because the worms that lived longer,

83
00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.890
they didn't actually have this working gene. Right?

84
00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.470
When we make a mutation in the Daf two gene,

85
00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:50.010
we damage it and that actually causes it not to work as well.

86
00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:51.870
So that actually is kind of profound.

87
00:04:51.871 --> 00:04:54.090
That tells you right away that the worm has a gene in it.

88
00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:56.220
That's shortening the warms lifespan,

89
00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:00.180
which is why she calls it the grim reaper,

90
00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:05.780
the grim reaper gene. It's the gene that makes you die

91
00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:11.460
if you're aware. Right? So by damaging this gene,

92
00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:14.640
Cynthia and her team essentially are taking the grim reaper

93
00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.800
and knocking his knees out and stop that. Okay,

94
00:05:19.801 --> 00:05:24.120
so the question is what exactly is the def to doing to make the cell age more

95
00:05:24.121 --> 00:05:27.600
quickly? Here's where the story gets a little weird.

96
00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:34.070
Well, we found another gene whose name is also daft, but it's a different Daf.

97
00:05:34.071 --> 00:05:38.810
It's called daft 60 and this is a gene whose normal function is to keep you

98
00:05:38.811 --> 00:05:39.644
young.

99
00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:46.040
It's like a fountain of Youth Change to the way that there was a grim he virgin

100
00:05:46.041 --> 00:05:48.680
before, right? And now there's a fountain of youth genes.

101
00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:51.080
That's what she discovered at inside the worms.

102
00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:54.710
These genes are struggling with each other. Here's how it works. When it,

103
00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:55.650
when a worm ages,

104
00:05:55.670 --> 00:06:00.670
normally the death two receptor two kind of squashes the activity of deaf 16 it

105
00:06:01.101 --> 00:06:01.934
turns it down.

106
00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:07.903
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

107
00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:10.060
<v 1>lukewarm ages. Okay.</v>

108
00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:14.560
So when you come along and you inhibit the activity of the def two receptor

109
00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:18.910
outage, now you liberate daft 16 yeah, free.

110
00:06:18.911 --> 00:06:22.690
It springs into action and it activates about a hundred genes

111
00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:25.023
in the DNA.

112
00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:31.290
These hundred genes each do a little tiny good thing for the cell and altogether

113
00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:33.100
it makes the cell live twice as long.

114
00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:36.473
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

115
00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:40.150
<v 0>so let me just back up here. So there's the bay, there's the, there's the,</v>

116
00:06:40.151 --> 00:06:43.360
there's the bad gene, the gene that says, all right, everybody died.

117
00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:45.820
But the way that it tells everybody dies,

118
00:06:45.821 --> 00:06:48.790
it goes particularly over to this little guy over in the corner who's the good

119
00:06:48.791 --> 00:06:53.770
guys who's repairing and protecting and fighting disease. And it says to it,

120
00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:58.240
conks it on the head like some kind of three stooges things is you shut up.

121
00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:03.220
Exactly. So if that good guy can stay vibrant,

122
00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:05.520
then we are in the bowling game for a little while.

123
00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:06.630
<v 1>Exactly. Very good.</v>

124
00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:11.400
And you can get a lifespan that may increase save 100% like the one I mentioned

125
00:07:11.401 --> 00:07:15.390
even longer, even threefold fold. How'd you do that? Well,

126
00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:19.110
we found that the signals from the reproductive system affect aging.

127
00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:23.250
It turns out Canyon and her team found that if you steal away some of the worms,

128
00:07:23.251 --> 00:07:27.360
BB making powers, that alone makes them live longer if you do that.

129
00:07:27.361 --> 00:07:28.051
So what we did,

130
00:07:28.051 --> 00:07:32.040
and if you crippled the grim reaper genes and if you strengthen the fountain of

131
00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:34.680
Youth Gene, the best possible change, we knew how to make,

132
00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:35.910
well now we're talking,

133
00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:41.010
we get incredibly healthy animals that are lived to be

134
00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:43.373
six times

135
00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:45.560
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

136
00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:49.250
<v 1>on average, which would be like 500 years for a human and they're so healthy.</v>

137
00:07:49.251 --> 00:07:50.560
It's incredible. Okay,

138
00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:54.710
so that would be like Ben Franklin is still being around playing go. It's yeah,

139
00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:58.250
it would be, it's just blows your mind to think about it. Which by the way,

140
00:07:58.470 --> 00:08:00.530
that doesn't mean that it will ever be possible in humans.

141
00:08:00.810 --> 00:08:03.350
<v 0>Then why do we turn it by the way, listening to this program, no,</v>

142
00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:05.430
she kind of has to say that because she's a scientist.

143
00:08:05.431 --> 00:08:08.760
She doesn't know yet whether it affects us. Um, on the other hand,

144
00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:10.580
she has started the company. Yes.

145
00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:13.620
Elixir and the company is making a pill that it's a pill for people.

146
00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:17.490
Interestingly, have you any notion of how much you could slow down the process?

147
00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:19.000
<v 1>Well, we don't know. You know,</v>

148
00:08:19.001 --> 00:08:20.950
we're just hoping that we can slow it down at all,

149
00:08:21.190 --> 00:08:25.000
but just imagine used to be, people would talk about that,

150
00:08:25.001 --> 00:08:29.890
but as the world of fairytales and fantasy and now it's sort of reopens the

151
00:08:29.891 --> 00:08:32.490
quest for the found of youth in a new molecular way.

152
00:08:36.890 --> 00:08:37.540
<v 6>[inaudible]</v>

153
00:08:37.540 --> 00:08:39.920
<v 1>how did the, wait a second though, what happens if she,</v>

154
00:08:39.921 --> 00:08:43.310
dare I say it succeeds with this little pill of hers.

155
00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:48.400
Do we necessarily want a lot of 500 year old golfers hanging around not getting

156
00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:49.960
out?

157
00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:52.090
<v 0>Oh, we were already there in, in some places in the world,</v>

158
00:08:52.091 --> 00:08:53.710
in Germany and in Japan,

159
00:08:53.711 --> 00:08:56.970
the population of older people has grown to the point where you,

160
00:08:57.690 --> 00:08:59.700
if you are in middle aged or younger person,

161
00:08:59.701 --> 00:09:03.630
you'd feel the oppression of having so many people to support and to get worried

162
00:09:03.631 --> 00:09:07.860
for a second. Japan might be a canary in the coal mine as it were.

163
00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:10.870
<v 7>Sort of a glimpse of where we're all headed. Jocelyn Ford,</v>

164
00:09:10.871 --> 00:09:15.871
a reporter has been looking at aging societies in Asia and recently took a trip

165
00:09:16.001 --> 00:09:19.450
back to Japan where she used to live to see how they're dealing with things and

166
00:09:19.451 --> 00:09:20.530
I arrived in Japan.

167
00:09:20.531 --> 00:09:24.280
It was immediately obvious that that there was something different here.

168
00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:29.230
I went into the closest little town to the airport and there was a [inaudible]

169
00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:31.110
<v 8>festival street festival going on. I</v>

170
00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:36.940
went down the street and what really surprised me is I think of street fairs and

171
00:09:36.941 --> 00:09:39.820
kids playing and you know, let's go out with a family.

172
00:09:40.270 --> 00:09:44.320
But everyone sitting around listening to the music was a lot of gray heads.

173
00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:49.810
I met a guy who was like 90 years old and he was on a bicycle

174
00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:57.220
and even when he cycled off, I felt it's a different society.

175
00:09:58.790 --> 00:10:02.920
<v 7>Bottom line is this job in Japan easing is very fast.</v>

176
00:10:02.921 --> 00:10:06.540
The fastest ever in the entire world. This guy banging the chocolate. Yeah,

177
00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:08.620
that's humor. A little gala hero gala.

178
00:10:08.770 --> 00:10:11.860
I'm a demographer at the New York University populace and Research Institute.

179
00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:14.760
Where is that by the way? No. Is that in Tokyo and Tokyo?

180
00:10:15.130 --> 00:10:17.650
And he said that the reason that Japan looked so old,

181
00:10:17.651 --> 00:10:21.460
all of a sudden it's because in part people are living longer,

182
00:10:21.461 --> 00:10:25.780
but that's not the big reason. The big reason is that the birth rate is falling,

183
00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:29.770
the Japanese population is shrinking. They're not having as many kids already.

184
00:10:29.830 --> 00:10:30.850
That's exactly it.

185
00:10:31.210 --> 00:10:33.640
And this is something that's happening all over the developer world.

186
00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:36.730
People are having smaller families and as a result,

187
00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:39.910
there are fewer young people, more older people right now.

188
00:10:39.911 --> 00:10:44.911
And in fact the proportion of the elderly men 65 and over is more than 21% which

189
00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:49.030
is the highest anti world. 21% elderly. Can you imagine what that looks like?

190
00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:51.130
No, just don't think Florida.

191
00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:55.110
What do you think of when you think of Florida? Florida?

192
00:10:55.170 --> 00:10:58.020
I think of beaches and I do. Well,

193
00:10:58.021 --> 00:11:01.500
that's where a lot of old folks go to retire. So I think it's of a lot of,

194
00:11:01.501 --> 00:11:04.920
you know, 70 80 year olds, Florida is the oldest state in the United States,

195
00:11:04.921 --> 00:11:05.970
but compared to Japan,

196
00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:08.620
<v 8>it's young.</v>

197
00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:13.620
<v 7>It's only 17% over 65 and Japan is 21% whoa.</v>

198
00:11:14.530 --> 00:11:17.500
So imagine that all of Japan looks like Florida,

199
00:11:17.650 --> 00:11:22.650
just older and OCO expects that percentage to double in 40 years. Oh,

200
00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:26.560
right now. I mean, can I read a picture? The future scenario,

201
00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:29.200
but it's going to change.

202
00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:33.670
<v 8>I got some insight into that change back at the street fair.</v>

203
00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.440
I went to get some tea and rice crackers. I in that shop,

204
00:11:39.070 --> 00:11:43.120
there was 103 [inaudible]. Granted I tried to talk to her,

205
00:11:43.930 --> 00:11:46.710
but she couldn't really communicate, but

206
00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:49.773
she didn't, I don't

207
00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:52.420
<v 7>really know what was going on. Nanny,</v>

208
00:11:52.930 --> 00:11:57.930
her daughter who's in her sixties is the main caretaker is 16 in her sixties and

209
00:11:59.231 --> 00:12:03.070
she has to, the granny can no longer get out of her wheelchair by herself.

210
00:12:03.071 --> 00:12:06.970
She can't take a bath. She's completely dependent on her daughter,

211
00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:08.490
like a baby nanny,

212
00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:12.700
but she's a lot heavier than a baby and who her daughter had really strained her

213
00:12:12.701 --> 00:12:13.810
back and hurt herself.

214
00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:20.610
The elder looking at me to the agent basically. And that's probably the biggest,

215
00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:21.390
the biggest [inaudible]

216
00:12:21.390 --> 00:12:24.170
<v 9>problem. The problem is that the caregivers,</v>

217
00:12:24.350 --> 00:12:29.350
a primary of the caregivers is about forties and 50s so we are sort of short on

218
00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:30.480
caregiver.

219
00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:32.940
<v 7>That never occurred to me that from society's perspective,</v>

220
00:12:32.941 --> 00:12:37.560
the reason kids are are good or useful is so that they take care of the old

221
00:12:37.561 --> 00:12:40.490
people. Yeah. That government spokesman I spoke with,

222
00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:43.640
thank you so much for making this tiny Gucci [inaudible].

223
00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:46.460
He was quite concerned about about that.

224
00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:51.760
There's going to be a shortage of labor as society ages and someone has got to

225
00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:56.540
fill the void in countries like the United States.

226
00:12:56.541 --> 00:13:00.470
We might import foreign labor. Sure. Meaning immigrants care for the elderly,

227
00:13:00.471 --> 00:13:04.600
you know, but in Japan it'll happen only reluctantly,

228
00:13:04.670 --> 00:13:09.670
not so simple because this society is still debating whether it's going gonna be

229
00:13:10.551 --> 00:13:13.860
a good thing or not to increase in library immigrants.

230
00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:18.870
We have decided to open our labor market to some extent.

231
00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:23.060
Nishimura yes, please. Another government spokesman forest,

232
00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:27.300
we have started said the government has decided they can allow me more than 100

233
00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:31.250
hundred Filipino being caregivers to come into the country.

234
00:13:31.490 --> 00:13:36.250
Just a hundred just a hundred huh? I know what you're thinking. Is it basically,

235
00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:38.810
is it basically because Japan is, you know, phobic

236
00:13:40.010 --> 00:13:42.820
<v 9>well, um, let's put it this way.</v>

237
00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:45.590
Japanese people tend to

238
00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:49.370
have this island concept.

239
00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:53.520
Having more international workers in our neighborhood might die. Dude,

240
00:13:53.521 --> 00:13:54.530
that kind of tradition.

241
00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:56.930
I think that's what the Japanese people might be worried about.

242
00:13:57.770 --> 00:14:02.600
What's wrong with that? Things change. I think basically communication,

243
00:14:03.550 --> 00:14:05.360
particularly when he's sick. I mean when you're bedridden,

244
00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:09.470
if the nurses are foreign foreigners, then you have to communicate.

245
00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:10.430
It's very difficult.

246
00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:13.090
<v 7>You know, some people might think that's Xeno phobic,</v>

247
00:14:13.091 --> 00:14:15.880
that people don't don't want to deal with foreigners,

248
00:14:15.881 --> 00:14:17.140
but that's not really what it's about.

249
00:14:17.530 --> 00:14:19.600
People don't want to be a burden to anybody.

250
00:14:20.590 --> 00:14:22.930
They don't want to depend on anybody. I don't want to

251
00:14:25.590 --> 00:14:29.200
have the same burden. If you say this is Mr Suga,

252
00:14:29.410 --> 00:14:32.750
he's a demographic researcher. You just don't want to be a burden. No.

253
00:14:33.490 --> 00:14:38.260
This feeling that you shouldn't be a burden. It runs very deep physically,

254
00:14:38.261 --> 00:14:40.390
psychologically, a boss of them.

255
00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:45.780
I just prefer I will be helped not by any other people.

256
00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:50.570
Why is that? Just a feeling.

257
00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:55.700
It might cause problems with them, with other people.

258
00:14:57.380 --> 00:15:01.340
So you'd be more comfortable knowing that you're not putting anyone else causing

259
00:15:01.341 --> 00:15:02.174
them trouble.

260
00:15:02.730 --> 00:15:04.590
<v 8>Yup. Yup, Yup, Yup.</v>

261
00:15:05.210 --> 00:15:08.870
<v 7>So if I will need some help from other people,</v>

262
00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:14.130
I might want to kill myself. That's how extreme it gets.

263
00:15:14.131 --> 00:15:15.540
This is a young man who's 30.

264
00:15:15.541 --> 00:15:20.460
He said I would rather commit suicide than be taken care of by somebody who

265
00:15:20.461 --> 00:15:24.180
doesn't want to take care of me. Who, who I'd be a burden on. You know. Uh,

266
00:15:24.210 --> 00:15:28.680
there is a culture like two, 300 years ago in Japan,

267
00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:34.340
if the old Walmarts a life until like six 70 years old,

268
00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:38.340
then, uh, family take this,

269
00:15:38.430 --> 00:15:42.560
this old mothers to a mountain and so

270
00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:45.640
<v 8>stay there. Make that my best date. Yeah.</v>

271
00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:51.010
It's a very long tradition in Japan of they call it at Oh boss

272
00:15:52.750 --> 00:15:56.740
[inaudible] Obamian is it grandma and stamens too to throw up,

273
00:15:57.010 --> 00:16:00.970
throw away your serious, they have whole movies about this in Japan.

274
00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:07.240
[inaudible] there's one called [inaudible]

275
00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:11.310
<v 7>the ballot of Nakayama. It's second, a very poor rural village.</v>

276
00:16:11.340 --> 00:16:12.450
About a hundred years ago.

277
00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:17.750
<v 8>The story of a son, his old mother up the mountain</v>

278
00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:21.860
on the way up, they pass by another son,

279
00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:25.520
literally killing his father off of a cliff.

280
00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:31.573
[inaudible]

281
00:16:33.790 --> 00:16:36.160
<v 7>it makes a family happier.</v>

282
00:16:37.930 --> 00:16:40.780
So grandma's stays in the mountain and starves to death.

283
00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:47.160
The family is happier because there's less of a burden, right?

284
00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:49.470
It was understood among all the generations.

285
00:16:50.110 --> 00:16:51.780
This was the way the problem was solved.

286
00:16:54.490 --> 00:16:56.810
Not Anymore, obviously. Right? Right.

287
00:16:56.850 --> 00:16:58.960
In Japan is really quite socialist these days.

288
00:16:58.990 --> 00:17:02.590
They look after everyone in society, but that idea is still out there.

289
00:17:03.010 --> 00:17:06.550
So what do you do today? You don't want your kids to take care of you.

290
00:17:06.551 --> 00:17:10.870
You don't want foreigners to take care of you. Who's left? Well,

291
00:17:10.871 --> 00:17:15.130
one solution is instead of having people do these jobs have machines,

292
00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:19.130
<v 8>machines, robots, robots,</v>

293
00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:24.630
you joking. It's not actually a joke. Um,

294
00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:29.270
Panasonic and others are manufacturing robots. As a

295
00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:31.930
<v 7>caregivers, when you think about it, it sort of makes sense.</v>

296
00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:34.380
Why don't we automate the heavy duty [inaudible]

297
00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:39.390
<v 8>welcome to meet Ali. They did a bunch of labs and met with some scientists.</v>

298
00:17:39.690 --> 00:17:44.350
This Robert, it's connected to here. They've got robots that will,

299
00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:46.510
it looks like a dentist chair or your wheelchair,

300
00:17:46.511 --> 00:17:50.280
where to go and how fast this is going. There's a special pair of trousers

301
00:17:50.370 --> 00:17:53.790
<v 7>that you can put on and if your legs are weak and you can't walk well,</v>

302
00:17:53.791 --> 00:17:57.810
it will help you walk. There's a washing machine robot.

303
00:17:57.840 --> 00:17:59.460
It looks like it's got a fancy handle.

304
00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:03.330
It's actually for washing people or any of these natural use. Yes, they are.

305
00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:08.010
Will do not want to have to ask somebody to clean their diapers to wash their

306
00:18:08.011 --> 00:18:11.010
bum. Right. I think for anybody in any society,

307
00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:16.440
that is a difficult thing to have to ask somebody robots up more. I mean, don't,

308
00:18:16.441 --> 00:18:19.330
you don't have to talk. You just press a button. Now.

309
00:18:19.331 --> 00:18:20.860
This is where I start to get weirded out.

310
00:18:21.910 --> 00:18:25.270
I went to a nursing home about an hour and a half outside of Tokyo

311
00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:28.510
[inaudible] people must be sitting around.

312
00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:31.150
There's a television about three people are watching the TV.

313
00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.040
One's looking out the window.

314
00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:36.880
I walked in and there were a lot of old people just sitting around each keeping

315
00:18:36.940 --> 00:18:40.090
mostly to themselves, sitting very quietly,

316
00:18:41.290 --> 00:18:46.290
not talking. It was sort of sad in steps.

317
00:18:46.350 --> 00:18:47.550
Pero the seal

318
00:18:49.170 --> 00:18:53.910
pro is one of the world's first therapy robots get it? No.

319
00:18:54.460 --> 00:18:55.293
What does that mean?

320
00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:59.070
What they've done is they've made this sort of like a large stuffed animal,

321
00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:04.110
white, furry, long eyelashes and flutters them at you and it squeals.

322
00:19:06.330 --> 00:19:09.090
When Paul came out, one of the grantees just lit up,

323
00:19:10.530 --> 00:19:11.850
got so excited.

324
00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:16.560
She peered into the seals eyes and she tried to talk to it

325
00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:21.593
to come the

326
00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:26.160
same feeling that when family come here,

327
00:19:27.630 --> 00:19:28.500
I was taken back.

328
00:19:28.501 --> 00:19:31.830
I mean it's not much more than a moving stuffed animal and how could you look at

329
00:19:31.831 --> 00:19:35.760
it and see companies see something alive? It's something comforting,

330
00:19:35.940 --> 00:19:39.930
feeling a little bit warm. It's Pero warm temperature control.

331
00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:44.820
I spoke to the developer, Mr [inaudible], so you're warm blooded, Huh?

332
00:19:44.910 --> 00:19:45.420
He said, yeah.

333
00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:49.110
They wanted a creature that would give them positive feedback but also sort of

334
00:19:49.111 --> 00:19:51.630
made them good for puddle,

335
00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:55.050
so of tried to be stroked by the owner like you're doing right now.

336
00:19:56.020 --> 00:19:57.840
You program to want to be home held.

337
00:19:58.860 --> 00:20:02.850
He also programmed them to respond to different names. For example,

338
00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:07.140
by call him as part of a new name like John or something,

339
00:20:07.290 --> 00:20:11.090
or like Chaco Channel and called the new name again. Again,

340
00:20:12.970 --> 00:20:15.210
gradually learn the new name and start the response

341
00:20:17.310 --> 00:20:20.340
so it's learning you down carefully because we don't want to hurt you. Oh,

342
00:20:20.341 --> 00:20:23.040
you want to be held again. They learn from their environment.

343
00:20:23.070 --> 00:20:26.640
Now these are really rudimentary, you know, beginning baby robots,

344
00:20:27.330 --> 00:20:29.910
but it worked, Jed, it worked.

345
00:20:36.390 --> 00:20:40.380
They adored it. They were loving it and it was loving them in their minds.

346
00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:49.750
I started to think maybe this is a solution.

347
00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:54.670
People might actually be able to engineer compassion, engineer, companionship.

348
00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:57.760
But then I started asking a lot of people around me.

349
00:20:57.761 --> 00:20:59.320
It took an informal Straw poll.

350
00:20:59.470 --> 00:21:02.230
Would you feel comfortable with a robot taking care of you?

351
00:21:02.231 --> 00:21:04.570
And most people said, no, not really.

352
00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:08.950
[inaudible] like this woman, Keiko Sugi,

353
00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:12.210
she actually came up with a brilliant idea, which seems like a no brainer.

354
00:21:12.970 --> 00:21:14.890
She has a nursing home,

355
00:21:15.220 --> 00:21:19.960
which is together with a preschool. So we'd actually you to take a tour.

356
00:21:28.740 --> 00:21:33.720
<v 8>You walked into the room and you are bombarded by these little parties flying</v>

357
00:21:33.721 --> 00:21:37.320
around. It's just over the top.

358
00:21:37.810 --> 00:21:38.643
<v 10>Well,</v>

359
00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:43.730
<v 8>and it's expensive. And if you are an old person in that environment,</v>

360
00:21:43.731 --> 00:21:45.990
you have no time whatsoever to dwell on

361
00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:47.990
<v 7>the idea that you are dying.</v>

362
00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:52.820
<v 8>The kids are, they demand your attention, but you need, you</v>

363
00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:57.950
need it again. But the first thing that you told us,

364
00:21:57.951 --> 00:22:00.620
the very beginning is that they're more old folks, less kids. Well,

365
00:22:00.621 --> 00:22:03.830
what happens when these kids we're listening to right now when they tondo

366
00:22:06.590 --> 00:22:09.900
<v 7>there's just a bunch of old people around and there's gonna be one kid left and</v>

367
00:22:09.901 --> 00:22:11.610
they all go to visit that one kid.

368
00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:16.230
I mean that that can't work and you expect me to have an answer will be we

369
00:22:16.231 --> 00:22:19.710
should import kids. I don't know. No, I mean you're joking obviously,

370
00:22:19.711 --> 00:22:23.640
but when I guess what I'm asking is like w are we left at the end just to,

371
00:22:23.641 --> 00:22:28.290
to think that this society cannot support all of its members getting old.

372
00:22:28.670 --> 00:22:32.330
That somehow the old have to step out of the way that I think you're thinking is

373
00:22:32.331 --> 00:22:36.410
basically old fashioned. They will be more old people and fewer young people.

374
00:22:36.411 --> 00:22:39.650
That's a fact. You're not going to turn the clock back on this.

375
00:22:40.220 --> 00:22:43.580
Societies do change. People do come up with new ideas and right now, hey,

376
00:22:43.730 --> 00:22:44.930
they're stabbing in the dark after them.

377
00:22:44.931 --> 00:22:49.610
But one day they'll come up with a solution. So learn to deal with it.

378
00:22:51.170 --> 00:22:52.580
Tammy, you just bitch slap me.

379
00:22:55.150 --> 00:22:59.450
<v 8>You call me all the way across the Pacific Ocean, across the whole continent.</v>

380
00:23:01.170 --> 00:23:03.290
Break now, cause they've got to sort of pick up my ego.
