00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.400
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:06.040
So we've moved on
into Chapter 3.

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:10.540
Chapter 1 and 2 were about
equations we could solve,

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:12.400
first order equations,
chapter one;

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.380
second order equations
in chapter 2, often

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:19.100
linear, constant
coefficient sometimes.

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.920
Now we take any equation.

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.560
And I'll start with first order.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.720
First derivative is
some function and not

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:34.600
a linear function, so I
don't expect a formula.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.290
A solution will exist.

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:38.950
But I won't have a
formula for the solution.

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:41.650
But I can make a
picture of the solution.

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:45.280
You see what's happening
as time goes on.

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:51.590
And so that's today's
lecture, is a picture.

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:56.880
So this function, whatever
it is, gives the slope of y.

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.280
That's the slope.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.890
And it will be the
slope of the arrows

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.230
that I will draw
in this picture.

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.520
So here's a picture
that started, y, t.

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.380
And the slope of
the arrows is f.

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.720
And here is my example.

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.340
Well, you will see.

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.370
I chose a constant
coefficient linear equation.

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:20.750
Because I could find a solution.

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.560
So 2 minus y, I know
from that minus sign

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.580
that I'm going to
have exponential decay

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:30.730
in the null solution.

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:36.550
And then y equal to 2 is a very
special particular solution,

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:37.510
a constant.

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:45.090
And in my picture, y
equal to 2, it jumps out.

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:51.280
Because when y is 2, when
y is 2 the slope is 0.

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:57.220
So all my arrows on the y
equal to 2 line, have slope 0.

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:59.520
So that's a very special line.

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.300
And since the solution
follows the arrows

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:03.860
that's the whole point.

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.370
The solution follows the arrows.

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:09.680
Because the arrows
tell the slope.

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:13.320
So if I'm on that
line, the solution

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:17.160
just follows those arrows,
and stays on the line.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:24.230
y equal to 2 is a fixed
point, fixed point

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.990
of the solution, a fixed
point for the equation.

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:34.400
And the question is, if I
don't start at y equal to 2,

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.830
do I move toward
2 or away from it?

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:39.650
OK.

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:45.420
So I can see from the formula
what the answer is going to be.

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.740
If I start with some other
value, some other value of c

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:54.710
not 0, then there will
be a null solution part.

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:58.550
But as t gets large
that goes to 0.

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:01.050
So I move toward 2.

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:03.360
Now let's see that
in the picture.

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.780
So let me-- I'm drawing
the arrows first.

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:18.990
So this is all time starting
at if y is 0, then if y is 0

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:21.010
then dy dt is 2.

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.710
So I draw arrows with slope
2, along the y equals 0 line.

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:28.720
This is the y equals 0 line.

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.610
All my arrows have slope 2.

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:34.340
Now what else?

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:40.280
So that's a few arrows that
show what will-- so the solution

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:45.580
if it starts there, will start
in the direction of that arrow.

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:51.840
But then I have to see
what the other arrows are

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.510
for other values of y.

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:57.520
Because right away the
solution y will change.

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.470
And the slope will change.

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:01.610
And that's it needs more arrows.

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:03.969
Well, actually it
needs way more arrows

00:04:03.969 --> 00:04:05.010
than I can possibly draw.

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:09.230
Let me draw another
line of arrows

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:15.410
when y is 1, along that line,
along the line y equal 1.

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:19.209
When y is 1, 2 minus 1 is 1.

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:20.649
The slope is 1.

00:04:20.649 --> 00:04:22.000
f is 1.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.780
And my arrows have slope 1.

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:28.650
So all along here,
the arrows go up.

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:30.860
Those went up
steeply with slope 2.

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:32.650
Now the arrows will go up.

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:39.660
So I'll have arrows that are
going a 45-degree angle, slope

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:40.160
1.

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:45.770
Do you see?

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:49.340
I hope you begin to
see the picture here.

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:52.230
The solution might start there.

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:53.870
It would start with that slope.

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:56.900
But it will curve down.

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.510
Because the arrows
are not so steep.

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:03.980
As I go upward, the
arrows are getting flat.

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:08.400
And so the curve that
follows the arrows

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:11.120
has to flatten out,
flatten out, flatten out.

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:13.490
The arrows are
still, at that point

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:15.620
the arrows are still slope 1.

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:17.740
But it's flattening out.

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:20.850
And it's never going
to cross this line.

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:25.240
And it will run closer
and closer to that line.

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:28.370
And wherever it
starts, if it starts

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:35.390
at time t equals to 1 there,
it'll do the same thing.

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:40.110
And it will stay just
below the other one.

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:43.170
Do you see what the
pictures are looking like?

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:49.350
If it starts at different times,
so these are different times.

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:51.850
These are different starts.

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:56.680
Yeah, really we're
used to, at t equals 0,

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:59.530
we're used to giving y of 0.

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:01.230
So this is starting at 0.

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:02.740
This is starting at 2.

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:06.410
Starting at 1 would
be a higher start.

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:09.130
What about starting at 4?

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:11.295
Suppose y of 0 is 4.

00:06:11.295 --> 00:06:15.210
That point is t
equals 0, y equal 4.

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:19.780
So that point is y of 0 equal 4.

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:23.690
What's the graph of the
solution with that start?

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:26.160
Actually, I could
figure out what

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:31.870
the solution would be if y
of 0 was 4, I'd have 2 plus 2

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:33.860
e to the minus t.

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:36.520
At t equals 0, that's 4.

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:38.200
And it fits.

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:40.360
It solves the equation.

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:44.350
And it's going to be its graph.

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:46.780
I should be able learn
that from the arrows.

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:54.610
So along this line of y equal
4, all the arrows when y is 4,

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:56.200
the slope is minus 2.

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:59.220
So these arrows
from these points,

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:05.440
go down with slope minus 2.

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:08.100
But the solution starts down.

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:10.780
So it starts like that.

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:14.680
But then it has to
follow the new arrows.

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:17.290
And the new arrows
are not so steep.

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:22.720
So the new arrows are
I have slope minus 1.

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:27.520
I hope my picture is
showing the steeper slope 2

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:32.130
along this line, and
the flatter slope 1,

00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:35.630
or rather minus 1
downwards, along this line.

00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:38.770
So it just follows along here.

00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:43.390
Well of course it's just a
mirror image of that one.

00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:46.330
It's a mirror image of that one.

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:52.500
I'm trying to show the
graph of all solutions

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:54.940
from all starts,
the whole plane.

00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:58.820
Actually I could go, t
could go to minus infinity.

00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:02.435
And y could go all the way
from minus infinity up,

00:08:02.435 --> 00:08:03.060
all the way up.

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:07.600
I could fill the whole board
here with arrows, and then

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:08.620
with solutions.

00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:12.590
And the solutions would follow
the arrows, the arrows changing

00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:17.570
slope and actually in this
case, all solutions wherever

00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:20.820
you started, would approach 2.

00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:24.540
And that's what
the formula says.

00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:28.220
But we get that information
from the arrows with no formula.

00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:31.200
Let me show you a next example.

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:33.120
And here's our next example.

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:36.150
The logistic equation,
it's not linear.

00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:38.000
So it's going to be
more interesting.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.860
And do you remember
the solution?

00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:43.710
You remember maybe the trick
with the logistic equation

00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:52.700
was 1 over the solution, gave a
linear equation and expression

00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:53.680
like that.

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:54.820
OK.

00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:56.550
Time to draw arrows.

00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:57.180
OK.

00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:03.670
When y is 0-- so here's y--
when y is 0, the slope is 0.

00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:06.380
So I have a whole line of flat.

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:10.030
I have a flat horizontal line.

00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:16.540
That's the solution, y
equals 0 fixed point.

00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:18.690
Also we have
another fixed point.

00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:22.280
When y is 1, 1 minus 1 is 0.

00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:23.740
Slope is 0.

00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:25.860
Slope stays 0.

00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:30.710
The arrows all have zero slope
along the line y equal 1.

00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:34.490
So there is another
solution, which

00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:37.290
doesn't do anything exciting.

00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:39.510
It just stays at 1.

00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:47.360
y equal 1 is another
fixed point, steady state,

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:50.240
whatever words we want to use.

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:56.100
But again, the real picture
is what about other starts.

00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:58.830
What about a start at 1/2?

00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:03.460
Well if it starts at-- if y is
1/2 half at the starting time,

00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:05.540
what is the slope?

00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:10.250
1/2 minus 1/4 is 1/4.

00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:13.950
So the slope is upwards,
but not very steep.

00:10:13.950 --> 00:10:18.180
The slope along
the-- and it doesn't

00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:21.080
depend on t in these examples.

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:27.420
So that slope is the
same as long as y is 1/2,

00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:29.530
doesn't matter what the time is.

00:10:29.530 --> 00:10:33.470
y equals 1/2 gives me a 1/2
minus 1/4, which is a 1/4.

00:10:33.470 --> 00:10:34.890
It gives me that slope.

00:10:34.890 --> 00:10:38.450
What about the slope 1/4?

00:10:38.450 --> 00:10:43.420
So 1/4, I have 1/4 minus 1/16.

00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:45.960
I think that's 3/16.

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:52.390
So it's beginning
to climb upward.

00:10:52.390 --> 00:10:53.970
So it's upwards again.

00:10:53.970 --> 00:10:56.570
But 3/16 is a
little-- I don't know

00:10:56.570 --> 00:10:59.930
if I'm going to get the
picture too brilliantly.

00:10:59.930 --> 00:11:10.300
The slope, as soon it-- if it
just starts a little above 0,

00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:12.070
what happens to
the solution that

00:11:12.070 --> 00:11:15.060
starts a little bit above 0?

00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:16.500
It climbs.

00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:24.390
Because if y is above 0, say
if it starts between 0 and 1,

00:11:24.390 --> 00:11:30.390
if y is between 0 and 1, then
y is bigger than y squared.

00:11:30.390 --> 00:11:32.120
And the slope is positive.

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:33.710
And it goes up.

00:11:33.710 --> 00:11:35.380
So do you see what it's doing?

00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:38.200
The slope will just, if it
starts a little bit above,

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:39.720
it'll have a small slope.

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:42.230
But that slope will
gradually increase.

00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:45.860
But then actually at
this point, the slope

00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:48.660
is 3/4 minus whatever it is.

00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:53.030
It slows down,
still going upwards.

00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:55.000
y is still bigger
than y squared.

00:11:57.570 --> 00:12:03.210
You recognize what the
curve is going to look like.

00:12:03.210 --> 00:12:06.550
So there is an S curve.

00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:07.500
It's an S curve.

00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:16.500
Which we saw for the
logistic equation, and here

00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:18.920
we have a formula for it.

00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:21.970
Well, the whole point
of today's video

00:12:21.970 --> 00:12:24.180
was we don't need a formula.

00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:26.560
So you don't need that.

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:30.920
The arrows will tell you
that it starts up slowly.

00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:35.020
It gets only-- that's the
biggest slope it gets.

00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:36.560
And then it starts down.

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:38.080
The slope goes down again.

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:40.360
But it's still a positive slope.

00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:45.440
Still climbing, climbing,
climbing, and approaching 1.

00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:49.350
Now that's sort of a
sandwich in the picture.

00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:53.470
But it could start
with a negative.

00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:56.850
So what happens if it
starts at y equal minus 1?

00:12:56.850 --> 00:13:00.450
The slope, if y is minus
1, we have minus 1,

00:13:00.450 --> 00:13:02.820
minus 1, a slope of minus 2.

00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:08.310
That's a steeper
serious downward slope.

00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:12.950
So the solution that starts
here has-- that's tangent.

00:13:12.950 --> 00:13:15.490
You see that it's
tangent to the arrow,

00:13:15.490 --> 00:13:18.540
because it has the same
slope as the arrow.

00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:19.890
And it comes down.

00:13:19.890 --> 00:13:23.870
But as it goes down, the
slopes are getting steeper.

00:13:23.870 --> 00:13:26.315
Whoops, not flatter,
but steeper.

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:34.850
For example, if y is minus
2, I have minus 2, minus 4

00:13:34.850 --> 00:13:36.340
is minus 6.

00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:38.770
So as soon as it
gets down to minus 2,

00:13:38.770 --> 00:13:42.500
the slope has jumped
way down to minus 6.

00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:46.480
So here is the--
it falls right off.

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:49.690
It's a drop-off curve,
a drop-off curve.

00:13:49.690 --> 00:13:52.040
It falls right off
actually to infinity.

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:55.320
It never makes it out
to-- it falls down

00:13:55.320 --> 00:14:01.330
to y equal minus infinity in a
fixed time, in a definite time.

00:14:01.330 --> 00:14:06.140
And so here's a whole
region of curves going down

00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:07.610
to minus infinity.

00:14:07.610 --> 00:14:10.540
Here is a whole region.

00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:11.970
What happens in this region?

00:14:11.970 --> 00:14:16.850
Suppose y starts at plus 2?

00:14:16.850 --> 00:14:19.110
Well, I have 2 minus 4.

00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:20.730
So the slope is negative.

00:14:20.730 --> 00:14:22.180
The slope is negative up here.

00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:22.740
Yeah.

00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:24.450
And this is the big picture.

00:14:24.450 --> 00:14:29.570
The slope, the arrows are
positive below this line.

00:14:29.570 --> 00:14:31.120
They're upward.

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:33.120
They were downward here.

00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:36.580
They're slowly upward
in this sandwich.

00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:40.500
And then up above,
they're downward again.

00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:51.920
So if slopes are coming down,
and they drop into actually

00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:54.530
it's a symmetric picture.

00:14:54.530 --> 00:14:59.210
Really-- no reason not
to go backwards in time.

00:14:59.210 --> 00:15:01.000
Where are these coming from?

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
They're all coming from curves.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.240
The whole plane
is full of curves.

00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:08.180
And these start
at plus infinity.

00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:11.150
They drop into 2.

00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:18.380
These start below 0, and they
drop off to minus infinity.

00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:24.580
And then the real interest in
studying population was these.

00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:26.250
Can you do one more example?

00:15:26.250 --> 00:15:32.760
Let me take a third example
that has a t in the function.

00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:36.480
So the arrows won't be the
same along the whole line.

00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:40.630
In fact, the arrows
will be the same.

00:15:40.630 --> 00:15:47.460
So if I have 1 plus t minus y,
that's the f, equal a constant.

00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:55.340
Then that's a curve-- well,
it's actually a straight line.

00:15:55.340 --> 00:15:58.880
It's actually a 45-degree
line in this plane.

00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:08.610
And along that line the f, this
is the f, the f of t and y,

00:16:08.610 --> 00:16:10.090
the arrow slope.

00:16:10.090 --> 00:16:13.760
The arrows slopes are
the same along that line.

00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:16.740
That line is called an isocline.

00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:22.965
This is called an I-S-O, meaning
the same, cline, meaning slope.

00:16:25.610 --> 00:16:26.700
So that's an isocline.

00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:28.460
Here's an isocline.

00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:30.670
It's a 45-degree line.

00:16:30.670 --> 00:16:38.170
That's the 45-degree line,
1 plus t minus y equal 1.

00:16:38.170 --> 00:16:48.910
Let me draw the 45-degree line
1 plus t minus y equals 0.

00:16:48.910 --> 00:16:50.660
So it's a little bit higher.

00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:51.160
OK.

00:16:54.110 --> 00:16:59.680
Now arrows, and then put
in the curves, the solution

00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:02.400
curves that match the arrows.

00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:07.920
So the arrows have this
slope along that line.

00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:11.380
Along this line, 1 plus t
minus y, they have slope 0.

00:17:11.380 --> 00:17:12.829
Oh, interesting.

00:17:12.829 --> 00:17:15.329
At every point on the
line the slope is 0.

00:17:18.060 --> 00:17:21.210
Because this is the
slope of the arrows.

00:17:21.210 --> 00:17:24.650
At every point on
this line, the slope

00:17:24.650 --> 00:17:27.440
is 1, also very interesting.

00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:29.710
Because that's right
along the line.

00:17:29.710 --> 00:17:33.910
So here we have a solution line.

00:17:33.910 --> 00:17:35.350
That must be a solution line.

00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:39.210
That's the line where y is t.

00:17:39.210 --> 00:17:43.860
That's a very big
45-degree important line.

00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:48.920
Because if y equals
t, if y equals t

00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:51.440
then dy dt should be 1.

00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:53.560
And it is 1 for y equals t.

00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:57.260
So that's a solution
line with that solution.

00:17:57.260 --> 00:18:02.340
Now what about a line
with 1 plus t minus y

00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:04.710
equal minus 1, a line?

00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:10.410
If 1 plus t minus y is
minus 1, if f is minus 1,

00:18:10.410 --> 00:18:14.420
the slope is negative.

00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:15.930
So what does that mean?

00:18:15.930 --> 00:18:21.110
If 1 plus t minus y is minus
1, the slope is negative.

00:18:21.110 --> 00:18:27.300
So at points on this line,
the slope is going downwards.

00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:29.550
Oh, interesting.

00:18:29.550 --> 00:18:31.380
I wasn't quite expecting that.

00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:35.230
Let me just see if I
got a suitable picture.

00:18:35.230 --> 00:18:37.700
Why is it not right?

00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:44.660
If 1 plus t minus y
is-- oh, I'm sorry.

00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:49.540
This is the line,
y equal 1 plus t.

00:18:49.540 --> 00:18:52.090
I think what I'm
expecting to see

00:18:52.090 --> 00:18:56.260
is I'm expecting to
see it from the formula

00:18:56.260 --> 00:19:01.700
too that as time goes
on, this part goes to 0,

00:19:01.700 --> 00:19:03.180
and y goes to t.

00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:06.140
I believe that all
the solutions will

00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:09.803
approach this y equal to t.

00:19:09.803 --> 00:19:12.350
I think their
slopes, their slopes

00:19:12.350 --> 00:19:15.610
here-- darn, that's not right.

00:19:15.610 --> 00:19:20.090
Their slopes should
be coming upwards.

00:19:20.090 --> 00:19:22.460
Yeah, let me-- I
can figure that out.

00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:25.740
If t is let's say 1, and y is 0.

00:19:25.740 --> 00:19:26.340
OK.

00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:30.180
If t is 1, and y is 0,
I have a slope of 2.

00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:30.930
Good.

00:19:30.930 --> 00:19:31.800
OK.

00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:35.370
There's a point t equal to 1.

00:19:35.370 --> 00:19:37.700
Here is 0, 0.

00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:41.050
Here's the point t
equal to 1, y equals 0.

00:19:41.050 --> 00:19:43.070
The slope came out to be 2.

00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:44.820
It went up that way.

00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:48.620
So along that line, the
slopes are going up.

00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:54.550
Along this line, the slopes
are right on the line.

00:19:54.550 --> 00:19:57.390
On this line the
slopes are flat,

00:19:57.390 --> 00:20:01.130
and the curve is
moving toward the line.

00:20:01.130 --> 00:20:06.230
I'll just draw the beautiful
picture now of the solution.

00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:10.080
So the solutions look like this.

00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:14.442
They are-- this is the big line.

00:20:14.442 --> 00:20:16.500
You've got to keep
your eye on that line.

00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:19.800
Because that's the steady
state line that all solutions

00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:22.610
are approaching.

00:20:22.610 --> 00:20:28.630
So if you have the idea of
arrows to show the slope,

00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:34.070
fitting solution curves
through tangent to the arrows,

00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:37.260
and sometimes having
a formula to confirm

00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:42.870
that you did it right, you
get a picture like this.

00:20:42.870 --> 00:20:47.030
So that's the idea of first
order equations, which

00:20:47.030 --> 00:20:50.600
are graphed in the y-t plane.

00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:54.650
And the arrows tell
you the derivative.

00:20:54.650 --> 00:20:56.200
Thanks.
