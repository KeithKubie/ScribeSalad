00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.580
Let's now prove the divergence
theorem, which tells us

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:06.602
that the flux across the
surface of a vector field--

00:00:06.602 --> 00:00:08.560
and our vector field
we're going to think about

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:11.060
is F. So the flux
across that surface,

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:13.800
and I could call
that F dot n, where

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.640
n is a normal vector
of the surface--

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:18.050
and I can multiply
that times ds--

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:23.720
so this is equal to the
trip integral summing up

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.410
throughout the volume
of that region,

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:34.121
summing up that volume
of the divergence of F.

00:00:34.121 --> 00:00:36.620
And we've done several videos
explaining the intuition here,

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:38.490
but now we are actually
going to prove it.

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:42.560
And of course, we're times
each little differential cube

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:43.329
of volume.

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:45.120
And we're going to make
an assumption here.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.960
We're going to assume
that we're dealing

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.525
with a simple solid region.

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:59.815
And what this means,
more formally,

00:00:59.815 --> 00:01:01.440
is that the region
we're thinking about

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.680
can be a type I, type
II, and type III region.

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.890
I should say it is
all of the three.

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:12.630
So it is types I, II, and III.

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.540
And there are videos that go
into what each of these regions

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.790
are, but a lot of
the basic shapes

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:20.630
fall into this
simple solid region.

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.620
Like a sphere or a
cylinder of some kind,

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:28.630
they can be types I,
type II, and type III.

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.370
And for a lot of situations that
aren't simple solid regions,

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:34.500
you can break them up
into simple solid regions.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.780
But let's just prove it for
this case right over here.

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:40.610
So let's just assume
that our vector field

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:46.440
F can be written as P, which is
a function of x, y, and z times

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.520
i, plus Q, which is
a function of x, y,

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.690
and z times j, plus R,
which is a function of x, y,

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.590
and z times k.

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.460
So let's think about what each
of these sides of the equation

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:02.790
would come out to be.

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.600
Well, first of all, what
is going to be F dot n?

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.449
So let's think about
that a little bit.

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:19.270
F dot n is going to be
equal to this component

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:23.050
right over here times
n's i-component,

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:26.310
plus this component right over
here times n's j-component,

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.900
plus this component here
times n's k-component.

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:34.960
So we could write
it as P times--

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:38.270
or I'll just write P
open parentheses, the dot

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:47.470
product of i and
n, and let me make

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.010
sure I write i as a unit vector.

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:52.050
Now, I want to be clear.

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:53.674
What's going to happen
right over here?

00:02:53.674 --> 00:02:55.620
If you take the dot
product of i and n,

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.500
you're just going to get
the i-component, the scaling

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.024
factor of the i-component
of the n normal vector,

00:03:02.024 --> 00:03:03.940
and we're just going to
multiply that times P.

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.070
So that's essentially the
product of the x-components,

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:09.660
or I guess you could say the
magnitude of the x-components.

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:17.660
And then to that, we are going
to add Q times j dotted with n.

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.460
And once again, when
you dot j with n,

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:22.010
you get the magnitude
of the j-component

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.710
of the normal vector
right over there,

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:29.750
and then times-- or
plus, I should say,

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:35.070
plus R times k dotted with n.

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:37.140
This isn't how we
normally see it,

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.960
but I think it's reasonable to
say that this is actually true.

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:41.910
This right over
here is going to be

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:46.517
equal to P times the magnitude
of the i-component of n's

00:03:46.517 --> 00:03:49.100
normal vector, which is exactly
what we want in a dot product.

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:50.891
This is the same thing
for the j-component.

00:03:50.891 --> 00:03:53.990
This is the same thing
for the k-component.

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:58.390
And you can try it out Define
n as equal to m times i plus n

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:01.660
times j plus o times k,
or something like that,

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:04.710
and, you'll see that this
actually does work out fine.

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:08.170
So how could we simplify this
expression right up here?

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:12.410
Well, we could rewrite
the left-hand side

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:16.970
as-- so the surface
integral of F--

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:18.550
now let me write
it multiple ways.

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:25.570
F dot ds, which is equal to
the surface integral of F dot n

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:30.409
times the scalar ds is
equal to the double integral

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:32.700
of the surface of all of this
business right over here,

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:37.070
is equal to the double integral
over the surface of-- let me

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:40.430
just copy and paste that--
of all of that business.

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:51.920
And I just noticed that I forgot
to put the little unit vector

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:55.360
symbol, a little caret
right over there.

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:01.310
Put some parentheses, and
then we are left with our ds.

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:03.160
And then this, all
of this, can be

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:08.270
rewritten as the
surface integral

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:09.900
of P times this business.

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.520
And I'll just do it in
the same color-- of P

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:17.700
times the dot product
of i and n ds,

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:23.910
plus the surface integral of
Q times the dot product of j

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:30.800
and n ds, plus the surface
integral of R times the dot

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:37.630
product of k and n-- I
Forgot a caret-- k and n ds.

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:38.740
So I just broke it up.

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:40.720
We were taking the
integral of this sum,

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:43.840
and so I just rewrote it as
the sum of the integrals.

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:46.400
So that's the left-hand
side right over here.

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.490
Now let's think about
the right-hand side.

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:49.947
What is the divergence of F?

00:05:49.947 --> 00:05:52.030
And actually I'm going to
take some space up here.

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:53.960
What is the divergence of F?

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:56.670
Well, the divergence of F
based on this expression of F

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:58.490
is just going to
be-- let me just

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:00.180
write it over here real small.

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:03.520
The divergence of
F is going to be

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:05.630
the partial of P
with respect to-- let

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:07.770
me do this in a new
color, because I'm

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:10.070
using that yellow too much.

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:13.730
The divergence of
F is going to be

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:17.360
the partial of P with respect
to x, plus the partial of Q

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:24.020
with respect to y, plus the
partial of R with respect to z.

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:27.780
So this triple integral
right over here

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:30.810
could be written as the triple
integral of the partial of P

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:33.890
with respect to x, plus the
partial of Q with respect to y,

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:37.370
plus the partial of
R with respect to z.

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:39.545
Well, this thing, once
again, instead of writing it

00:06:39.545 --> 00:06:41.362
as the triple
integral of this sum,

00:06:41.362 --> 00:06:43.320
we could write it as a
sum of triple integrals.

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:45.300
So this thing
right over here can

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:50.820
be rewritten as
the triple integral

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:53.107
over our
three-dimensional region.

00:06:53.107 --> 00:06:54.815
Actually, let me copy
and paste that so I

00:06:54.815 --> 00:06:56.148
don't have to keep rewriting it.

00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:02.350
So it's going to be equal to the
triple integral of the partial

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:11.610
of P with respect to x dv
plus the triple integral

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:18.990
of the partial of Q with respect
to y dv plus, once again,

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:29.531
triple integral of the partial
of R with respect to z dv.

00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:36.630
So we've essentially restated
our divergence theorem.

00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:39.000
This is our surface integral,
and the divergence theorem

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.150
says that this needs to
be equal to this business

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:42.840
right over here.

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:44.570
We've just written
it a different way.

00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:47.190
And so what I'm going to
do, in order to prove it,

00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:49.970
is just show that each of
these corresponding terms

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:53.860
are equal to each other, that
these are equal to each other,

00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:58.750
that these are
equal to each other,

00:07:58.750 --> 00:08:04.704
and that these are
equal to each other.

00:08:04.704 --> 00:08:07.120
And in particular, we're going
to focus the proof on this.

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:09.780
And we're going to use the fact
that our region is a type I

00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:10.280
region.

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:12.130
It's a type I, type
II, and type II.

00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:14.350
But we're going to use the
fact that it's a type I

00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:16.737
region to prove that these
two things are equivalent.

00:08:16.737 --> 00:08:18.570
And then you can use
the fact that it's also

00:08:18.570 --> 00:08:22.820
a type II and type III region to
make the exact same argument as

00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:28.410
to why this is equal to this
and why this is equal to that.
