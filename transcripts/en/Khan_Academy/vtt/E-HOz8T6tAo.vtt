00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:03.620
Let's learn a little bit
about just how a plain

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:05.770
vanilla bank works.

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:07.980
So let's say that I'm an
entrepreneur and I see a

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.580
problem out there
in the world.

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:12.320
You have all of these
hardworking people-- whatever

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.030
they do-- doctors, lawyers,
engineers, construction

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.240
workers-- whatever
they might do.

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.890
They work, they provide services
to each other and

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:23.350
they have savings, right?

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:25.160
So right now, they're
just-- whatever.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.285
They're burying it in
their backyards.

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:33.260
And they're just collecting
there, right?

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.940
That "money" is doing nothing.

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.940
They've provided some goods and
services to someone else.

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.710
Those people gave them
something, whether it's gold

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.480
or a green piece of paper, that
essentially says, this

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.910
gold or this green piece of
paper entitles you to some

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:53.550
future goods and services.

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.100
And those people said, that's
a useful thing that I have.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.440
Let me just put it
into my mattress.

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.910
There's this pool of savings
and let's say there's this

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.440
other pool of entrepreneurs
and they have a bunch of

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.810
really good ideas
for projects.

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:11.910
They're like, you know what?

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:15.590
If I could just to get-- let me
put this here: projects or

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:16.840
investments.

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.410
Let's say that there's some
other entrepreneur and he

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:29.870
says, boy, you know what?

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:32.580
I have no claims on any
goods and resources,

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:33.900
but I have an idea.

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.140
I have an idea that if I could
get a bunch of people to dig

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.170
canals to the crops, that we'll
be able to grow more

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.580
crops throughout the year and
we'll all be richer because

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.650
we'll all have more food and
that's a true good and service

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:50.270
in its best sense.

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.270
But how am I going to get these
people to build this

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.920
ditch for me?

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.310
I mean, I could maybe promise
them in the future that once

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.900
all of this is done, I can do
something, give them more

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:02.770
food, but that's not
the way it works.

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.510
No one's willing to work for me
unless they can feel very

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:08.500
secure that they're going to
get something in return.

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.580
So we have an interesting
problem here.

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.500
You have a bunch of people who
have already provided goods

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.930
and services to the world and
the world has given them

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.350
trinkets-- whether it's gold
coins or paper money.

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.610
Let's just say it's
gold, right?

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.550
And I want to make this point
because everyone always talks

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.570
about gold as if it's something
special, as if it

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:31.370
really represents wealth, while
paper money really does

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:32.770
not represent wealth.

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:33.440
And that's just not true.

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:34.990
There's nothing about gold.

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:38.900
Gold is not useful other than
the fact that it is pretty.

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.700
That's the only thing that
makes gold useful.

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.360
Actually, it's pretty and it's
hard to counterfeit.

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.380
Paper money-- not so pretty, but
it has other advantages.

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.310
It's lighter, and at least the
paper money we use now, is not

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:51.720
so easy to counterfeit.

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.070
I always want to make that--
people always somehow feel

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:59.300
that gold is somehow better
than paper money.

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:02.060
And we'll talk in the future
about inflation and deflation

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.070
and the fact that there is a
constraint on how much gold

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:06.800
can be produced, but you
can print money.

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.400
But we'll talk about that
in a little bit.

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.440
So in our modern world that
savings are these green pieces

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.340
of paper, but let's say we're
talking about some primitive

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.090
culture and they're
using gold.

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.930
So a bunch of people perform a
bunch of goods and services

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.060
and they get these
little coins.

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:25.420
And these coins are essentially
this society's way

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.160
of agreeing-- if you have one of
these coins in the future,

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.510
if you give this coin to someone
else, they'll do

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:32.340
something for you.

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.420
And how much of that coin
you have to give

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:35.005
for them to do it?

00:03:35.005 --> 00:03:38.880
It's based on supply and demand
and price, whatever.

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:43.560
These projects-- I say, well
if I only had some way of

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.180
convincing someone to dig a
canal, it would be hugely

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:48.960
beneficial and it will
create wealth-- or

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:51.630
dig irrigation ditches.

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:52.600
But how do I do that?

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.000
Well, if I had gold or if I
had these little coins, I

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.070
could give these coins to these
people, they would dig

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:03.380
the irrigation ditch and then
I could charge people the

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:07.750
service of using my-- or maybe
I'll charge people access to

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:11.410
water and then I could
essentially generate a return.

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:12.290
But how do I do that?

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:14.450
Well, what if I could borrow
some of these people, right?

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:18.500
These people have these units
of goods and services

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.209
called a gold coin.

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:24.840
If I could borrow some of their
money and use it to pay

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:30.670
people that will essentially do
the goods and service or do

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:33.750
the new project, then I'll
generate wealth.

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:36.060
And then I could share it with
these people, maybe in the

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:37.660
form of some type of interest.

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:43.130
Well, it's very hard in a vacuum
for these people to

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:44.600
evaluate these projects.

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:47.240
And maybe these projects, they
don't require just part of the

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:51.230
savings of one person, they
require the savings of 1,000

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:53.400
people because it's
a large project.

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.910
It's also hard for these people
to evaluate who has a

00:04:57.910 --> 00:04:58.660
good project.

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:01.920
It's hard for these people to
evaluate who has savings.

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:05.130
In fact, if I have savings, if
I've buried a bunch of stuff

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:07.270
in my backyard or in my
mattress, I don't want to

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:08.240
advertise it.

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:11.850
That's just going to make
people come and rob me.

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:14.880
So I'm a third entrepreneur and
I see an opportunity for

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:18.110
business and I call that
business a bank.

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:19.970
And so what is a bank
going to do?

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:21.590
What is my bank going to do?

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:22.960
Let's just talk about it
from the bare bones.

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:24.470
How am I going to start
my business?

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:29.290
I'm actually one of these
entrepreneurs.

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:31.340
Let's say I have some savings,
just to make it simple so I

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:32.910
don't have to go
into this pool.

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:38.130
So let's say I have a million
gold coins of savings-- let's

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:40.200
say it's a million dollars.

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:41.760
Let me draw my balance sheet.

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:51.630
And balance sheets, as you see,
they were useful even in

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:54.370
primitive cultures.

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:55.880
So that's my balance sheet.

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:13.070
Let's say my initial balance
sheet is-- I put in a million

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:14.495
dollars of my gold coins.

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:21.670
I'll say a million dollars
just because

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:22.920
we're used to that.

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:27.180
You could say a gold coin is
worth a dollar, so it's a

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:28.160
million gold coins.

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:30.340
We know that that's
not true anymore.

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:35.950
And I use that essentially to
build this big structure of

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:40.600
solid stone that looks really
safe and really secure.

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:45.520
So I use it essentially just to
build a big vault, right?

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:49.450
So this is my equity, right,
and I use it to build a

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:53.260
vault-- a big, nice, fancy
looking building.

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:54.750
So I'll actually draw
the building.

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:56.045
It has pillars in the front.

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:04.690
It looks like an old Greek
or Roman temple.

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:10.200
I think that's not an accidental
appearance.

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:12.670
So I build this nice looking
building that people would

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:14.450
feel comfortable keeping their
money in-- and that could

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:16.990
actually be safe for
safekeeping.

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:20.950
And I tell everyone, look, I
have this nice big building.

00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:23.970
Instead of having your money
insecure in your backyard or

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:27.240
your bed, why don't you put your
savings in this building

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:29.350
and if you ever need it, you
can come and get it?

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:32.820
And on top of that, I'm going
to pay you to keep

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:33.490
your money with me.

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:35.390
So everyone says, that's
a good deal and Sal's

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:38.190
trustworthy and, more than Sal,
that building looks even

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:41.990
more trustworthy because it
looks like a Greek temple.

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:45.910
So everyone puts their
savings with me.

00:07:45.910 --> 00:07:51.860
And let's say that that
is $10 million of

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:54.440
savings in my village.

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:56.450
I have a fairly wealthy
village.

00:07:56.450 --> 00:07:58.780
So that's $10 million
of deposits.

00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:00.460
This is a liability
for me, right?

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:01.360
Why is it a liability?

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:03.740
Because I owe that
to other people.

00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:05.630
They're giving it to
me for safekeeping.

00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:06.880
So this is my liabilities.

00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:13.980
This is my equity.

00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:16.070
If it wasn't just me, if there
was 10 shareholders, each of

00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:17.780
us would have 1/10 of this.

00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:19.740
But this is a sole
proprietorship

00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:21.420
so this is my equity.

00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:23.780
This is my building.

00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:24.880
I'm running a business
here, right?

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:26.060
I'm not doing this
as some type of

00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:28.290
nonprofit or charity work.

00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:31.950
So what am I going to do with
this $10 million of deposits?

00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:33.789
Well, I told people that
they can take the

00:08:33.789 --> 00:08:36.549
money out any time.

00:08:36.549 --> 00:08:37.980
I'm taking their money
as safekeeping.

00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:40.409
If they put it in and then one
day they can't get their money

00:08:40.409 --> 00:08:42.130
back, they're going to be
very suspicious of me.

00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:45.430
So I have to keep some of
the money set aside.

00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:48.370
This could be amongst 3,000
or 4,000 people.

00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:50.700
So at any given day, not
everyone-- hopefully not

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:51.870
everyone's-- going to pull
their money out or

00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:52.890
put their money in.

00:08:52.890 --> 00:08:56.850
But I need to keep some cash
reserves in case people want

00:08:56.850 --> 00:08:58.290
their money back.

00:08:58.290 --> 00:09:02.000
So I need to keep some of that
$10 million in cash.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.200
So let me do that in magenta.

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:08.100
Let me say I want to keep
10% of it in cash.

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:12.490
So I'm going to keep $1 million
in cash and then I

00:09:12.490 --> 00:09:16.820
have $9 million left that
I can hopefully put to

00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:19.290
productive use.

00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:22.370
And what I'd do with that $9
million is I loan it out to

00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:25.990
people who have really good
projects or investments.

00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:27.330
So $9 million in loans.

00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:28.440
That's an asset, right?

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:29.590
I give that money
to someone else.

00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:31.670
They owe me $9 million.

00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:34.260
I'm essentially borrowing $10
million, keeping $1 million

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:38.080
aside, and paying out
$9 million in loans.

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:41.140
There could be a bunch of
different projects.

00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:42.100
There could be 100.

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:44.040
I'm not just giving $9 million
to one person.

00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:46.840
I'm diversifying a bunch
across a bunch

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:48.150
of different projects.

00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:51.600
So the natural question is,
how am I making money?

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:55.600
Well, these loans-- I'm
hopefully putting them to

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:58.160
build irrigation ditches or
build factories or do

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:00.340
whatever, something that
actually is an investment,

00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:03.950
that creates more value than
it needed to start up.

00:10:03.950 --> 00:10:06.420
So I can actually charge
interest and that interest

00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:09.110
should be a cut of that value
that's being created.

00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:14.720
So let's say that I charge
10% on this money.

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:17.000
And just for the sake of it,
let's say I invest really well

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.110
and no one defaults.

00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:21.300
I'm the first bank so I get all
of the best investments.

00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:23.070
So I'm getting 10%.

00:10:23.070 --> 00:10:26.030
And for their money, these
people, not only do they get

00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:29.910
to keep their money in this
nice, safe deposit, but I'm

00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:31.160
also paying them 5%.

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:37.520
So how much money do
I make in a year?

00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:42.400
Well, I'm making 10%
on this $9 million.

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:43.190
So what is that?

00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:51.150
That's $900,000 a year
I'm bringing in.

00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:53.480
And how much am I paying
out every year?

00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:59.130
Well, 5% of $10 million--
I'm paying out $500,000.

00:10:59.130 --> 00:11:02.280
So interest income-- $900,000.

00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:04.120
Interest expense-- $500,000.

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:05.900
That nets me $400,000.

00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:09.600
And let's say I pay another
$100,000 for salaries and for

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:11.670
security guards and
all of that.

00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:15.940
So essentially, I'm
netting $300,000.

00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:17.990
So I'm netting $300,000.

00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:20.140
I'll do it in a little more
detail in the next video.

00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:21.900
But if you look at it big
picture, I put a million

00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:26.380
dollars in and every year, I'm
making $300,000 by providing

00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:29.890
this service-- by matching
up the savings with good

00:11:29.890 --> 00:11:30.500
investments.

00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:31.710
And everyone benefits.

00:11:31.710 --> 00:11:33.660
The pie's getting bigger
because these are real

00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:36.810
investments that are going
to benefit my village.

00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:39.710
And of course, these people
benefit because they get

00:11:39.710 --> 00:11:41.800
safekeeping for their
accounts and their

00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:42.610
money is actually growing.

00:11:42.610 --> 00:11:46.790
They're actually participating
in this capital investment.

00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:49.160
Anyway, see you in
the next video.
