00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:01.810
Here is your next challenge.

00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:05.850
In this rock, paper, scissors app,
the user selects from three buttons.

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.080
Then a view is presented with a response
from their opponent, the phone,

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:10.960
and a win or lose message.

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:14.740
Your challenge is to present the results
of a match in three different ways,

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:16.720
a different way for
each of the three buttons.

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.250
Implement presentation of the results
view controller from the rock button,

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.510
programmatically.

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.380
Implement the paper button using
a combination of code and segue.

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.070
And implement the scissors
button using only storyboard,

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.440
apart from the prepare for
segue method, of course.

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.180
When you're finished,
indicate your preferred method and

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:35.620
explain your choice in the text box.
