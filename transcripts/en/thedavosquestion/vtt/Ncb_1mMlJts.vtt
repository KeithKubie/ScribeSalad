00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.160
&gt;&gt; Role models are important for any generation
growing up. The problem is often we look for

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:10.750
role models far away and in the Middle East
we have so many role models probably closer

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:15.709
to home more than we expect. The future is
seeing those role models and that you can

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:20.460
be a hero even if you're not intelligent,
especially if you're not holding a gun, then

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:26.390
you're a hero. I hope for the next five to
ten years we can find the local role models

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.269
that make us all better people and help the
next generation make a better place in the

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.270
Middle East than our generation has been able
to.
