00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.970
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:09.650
WESLEY CHAN: By the way, I
met Alan about 20 years ago

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:11.370
when they first started touring.

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:12.660
ALAN PARSONS: Oh, turn around.

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.780
Turn around and show them.

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:17.000
WESLEY CHAN: A long time ago.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
They did not tour when they
were actually on all the charts.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.280
ALAN PARSONS: Unlike
a Spinaltap t-shirt,

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:27.117
it doesn't say "cancelled"
against half of them.

00:00:27.117 --> 00:00:29.200
WESLEY CHAN: That's good,
because sometimes I feel

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.950
personally cancelled.

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:34.630
All right, so I'll let Alan
and Julian take it away.

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:37.617
And I'll be back to
moderate afterwards.

00:00:37.617 --> 00:00:38.450
All right, you guys.

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.940
It's all yours.

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.856
ALAN PARSONS: For those
of you who don't know,

00:00:40.856 --> 00:00:42.540
this is Wesley Chan.

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.310
What's your official
title again?

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:45.680
WESLEY CHAN: Developer Advocate.

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:46.410
ALAN PARSONS:
Developer Advocate.

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.130
WESLEY CHAN: I teach
outside engineers

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:50.400
how to integrate Google
technologies into the apps

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.090
that they build-- web or mobile.

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:54.450
So I'm basically
your public face

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:59.464
for all you guys who are in
Android or work on product.

00:00:59.464 --> 00:01:00.880
ALAN PARSONS: I
find it incredible

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.390
that you don't all
know each other.

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.065
But then I found out
there's 20,000 of you.

00:01:05.065 --> 00:01:06.810
[LAUGHING]

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.130
That's pretty amazing.

00:01:11.726 --> 00:01:13.880
So we don't really
have a prepared speech,

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.870
but Julian insisted.

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:19.200
And I kind of read
through this this morning.

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.470
As Wes kindly mentioned, we are
promoting this book right here.

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:31.630
Although I don't think it's
fair to do shameless promotion

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.990
for the entire hour.

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.760
JULIAN COLBECK: This book
is based on a DVD series

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.690
that we produced
a few years ago.

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.320
And the kind of genesis
of why we did that

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.300
is the incredible
democratization

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.810
of recording
technology, which has

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.030
put wonderful tools
in people's hands.

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.070
But rather like just
handing somebody a plane

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.170
and say, well, take
off and fly it home,

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.690
to put a kind of recording
studio on a laptop in front

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:04.370
of people and expect them to
be able to make a decent record

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:05.940
is pretty unrealistic.

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:10.139
And Alan worked for
five, six years before

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:12.960
he became an engineer,
nevermind a producer,

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.430
and that kind of high flying
studio person, and recording

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.130
is complicated.

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.490
There's a lot of moving parts.

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:26.100
So that was the reason that we
wrote this book, to help people

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:32.690
who have kind of grown up
in a digital, plug-in based,

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:37.310
DAW based world, to
kind of introduce

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.590
some of the traditional
class concepts of recording

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.809
and help them kind of
go through that maze.

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:46.350
ALAN PARSONS: How many of you
have home recording facilities?

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:47.269
JULIAN COLBECK: Right.

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:48.060
ALAN PARSONS: Lots.

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.560
Lots.

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:55.560
JULIAN COLBECK: And so when
it came to the book idea--

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:56.980
we are going
backwards, I think we

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.660
are working the t-shirt next.

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.160
ALAN PARSONS:
Actually everybody who

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.796
has a computer in front of them
should have put their hand up

00:03:03.796 --> 00:03:08.010
because a laptop is a
recording studio these days.

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.810
Well, we'll qualify that.

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.670
JULIAN COLBECK: In
varying degrees.

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:18.210
But I think one of the
interesting kind of threads

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:21.560
that rums through both
the book and the DVD--

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.880
the video series-- is the
nature of what is good audio.

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:33.470
Is there a fixed
definition of good audio?

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:37.890
And if so, is it fixed in
terms of it's a constant,

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:41.560
or does it change with the
equipment and fashion and time?

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.380
If there is such a thing,
how do we achieve it?

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:52.090
And is there a point nowadays
in trying to go for excellence?

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:57.190
Alan gave the keynote address
at the Audio Engineering Society

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:59.540
in Los Angeles last month.

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:05.300
And it's supposed to be a kind
of fairly platitudeness bland

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:06.860
occassion, and
Alan came out there

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:10.290
and started ripping into
microphone manufacturers

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:11.120
and this and that.

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.060
And then he said
at one point, how

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.010
the hell did we let MP3 happen?

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:16.709
[GIBBERISH]

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:20.414
ALAN PARSONS: And then there
was a rousing applause.

00:04:20.414 --> 00:04:22.255
And I said, how did we
allow MP3 to happen?

00:04:22.255 --> 00:04:24.410
And everyone went, yeah!

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:29.665
And then here was the sad
thing at the end of the talk.

00:04:29.665 --> 00:04:31.498
WESLEY CHAN: In terms
of quality or in terms

00:04:31.498 --> 00:04:34.880
of being able to move
around the music faster?

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.450
ALAN PARSONS: In
terms of quality.

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:37.960
Just quality.

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:42.172
No, absolutely it's a great
way to move around and access

00:04:42.172 --> 00:04:43.880
lots of different
kinds of music quickly.

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:45.080
But just to finish this little--

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.780
JULIAN COLBECK:
But the problem was

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:48.870
is right in front is the guy who
invented MP3, who was literally

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:49.537
in front of him.

00:04:49.537 --> 00:04:51.536
ALAN PARSONS: He came and
shook hands afterwards

00:04:51.536 --> 00:04:53.095
and said, by the
way, I invented MP3.

00:04:53.095 --> 00:04:54.005
Pleased to meet you.

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:59.770
JULIAN COLBECK: So we moved
on very hastily from that.

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:05.140
But my theory is that
audio is a bit like shoes.

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:09.730
No matter how sharply you dress,
if you're wearing crap shoes,

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:11.240
it's not going to
work as an outfit.

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:12.859
I mean, your shoes
will give you away.

00:05:12.859 --> 00:05:14.650
And equally, if you
got really sharp shoes,

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:16.650
no matter how sloppily
you're dressing,

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:18.160
you're going to
look pretty cool.

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.560
And I think audio
is a bit like that.

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:24.790
I mean, in a movie you
can have jerky frames

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:29.650
and a sloppy script, and a
badly put together image,

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:31.310
but if the sounds
is good, it's going

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:33.310
to look and feel
kind of professional.

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:36.080
And audio is a very
important thing,

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:39.920
which I think a lot of
people now overlook.

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:42.170
ALAN PARSONS: It's always
the poor relation in movies,

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:42.560
unfortunately.

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:43.900
JULIAN COLBECK: That's right.

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:45.566
ALAN PARSONS: It's
always the last thing

00:05:45.566 --> 00:05:47.604
to get talked about or budgeted.

00:05:47.604 --> 00:05:48.520
JULIAN COLBECK: Right.

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:49.520
Or studied even.

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:54.350
I think nowadays when you got
such a preponderance of people

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:58.210
who are making their
own videos and stuff,

00:05:58.210 --> 00:05:59.600
audio is a kind of afterthought.

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:00.722
They're like, oh, shit.

00:06:00.722 --> 00:06:01.430
Now what do I do?

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:06.150
You know, but they don't
put the same focus into that

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:12.040
as they do the images and
I think at a great loss.

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:14.960
And I think that also
badly recorded tracking

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:19.960
of a great song is always
going to sound like a demo.

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:22.060
And a really well
recorded tracked,

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:24.140
even if the song is
a little bit iffy,

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:26.060
is always going to
sound professional.

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:30.120
So I think there are many
reasons to kind of study

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:32.970
what it is that
makes good audio.

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:35.380
And that's one of the things
that we kind of thread

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:38.640
through this whole
series and the book--

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:40.570
how to get good audio.

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:43.380
One of the stories
that Alan will tell,

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:44.880
which always really
kind of amazed

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:47.310
me was when Alan was
working with The Beatles

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:49.860
with Paul McCartney,
well, take on the story

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:51.160
of what he use to torment with.

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:53.180
ALAN PARSONS: Paul
would always say,

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:56.029
I think we can get
a better sound on--

00:06:56.029 --> 00:06:57.070
JULIAN COLBECK: Anything.

00:06:57.070 --> 00:06:59.480
ALAN PARSONS: --this instrument
or let's get a better

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:00.060
vocal sound.

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:01.559
And then you would
scratch your head

00:07:01.559 --> 00:07:03.406
and say, well, how do
I make this better?

00:07:03.406 --> 00:07:06.480
I'll change the mic,
I'll try a different EQ,

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:07.970
I'll try different effects.

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:13.800
But he never was able
to actually describe

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:16.410
what he was looking
for until he heard it.

00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:20.340
So that was the
challenge as an engineer,

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:26.030
to just work hard
until you found

00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:28.782
something that was
turning him on.

00:07:28.782 --> 00:07:30.240
JULIAN COLBECK:
Did you ever end up

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:32.531
with a kind of definition of
what it was that he meant?

00:07:32.531 --> 00:07:34.610
ALAN PARSONS: No.

00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:35.110
No.

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:36.820
It was always very vague.

00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:43.040
I mean, not just Paul, I
mean, people would say,

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:46.040
I think we need a more
aggressive snare sound.

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:47.660
Aggressive, OK.

00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:49.344
Where's the button
master aggression.

00:07:55.010 --> 00:07:56.230
But God bless him.

00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:59.100
Producers weren't
necessarily qualified

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:01.920
as engineers back in the day.

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:04.580
Almost all of them
are now qualified.

00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:10.490
In fact, the job description
has become extremely vague.

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:15.410
I mean, musicians, writers,
producers, engineers, computer

00:08:15.410 --> 00:08:18.170
operators, they can
all be one person

00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:22.060
now, which is interesting.

00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:27.950
But in my recent
work I've chosen

00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:33.434
to abandon some of the things
that I used to do in the past.

00:08:33.434 --> 00:08:36.809
And I used to operate 10
machines on my own sessions.

00:08:36.809 --> 00:08:41.950
But now if I'm using Pro
Tools or Cubase or something,

00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:46.860
I will have an operator
in the room, a guys that

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:48.910
does the computing stuff.

00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:51.640
And also means there is
somebody to make the coffee

00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:54.660
and tea and stuff like that.

00:08:54.660 --> 00:09:01.060
But I've always maintained
that producers, engineers

00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:03.810
need an assistant.

00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:07.200
I think a lot of
engineers and producers

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:10.120
try to do too much from
a technical standpoint,

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:14.400
and then lose ground
on the creative stuff.

00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:20.832
So I don't feel I am paid
to click a mouse all day.

00:09:20.832 --> 00:09:23.960
I concentrate on
music and the micing

00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:29.370
and the performance, the
songs, all that stuff.

00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:31.806
Any observations from
anybody about that?

00:09:31.806 --> 00:09:32.740
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:34.073
JULIAN COLBECK: It was all arms.

00:09:34.073 --> 00:09:34.630
Yeah.

00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:36.130
ALAN PARSONS: Well,
I actually don't

00:09:36.130 --> 00:09:38.560
remember because I was taking
too many drugs at the time.

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:40.460
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:41.352 --> 00:09:43.310
AUDIENCE: Can you repeat
the questions, please?

00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:44.018
ALAN PARSONS: OK.

00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:48.530
He asked a general
question about how

00:09:48.530 --> 00:09:51.330
"Dark Side of the
Moon" came about.

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:56.670
I was actually on the
staff at Abbey Road.

00:09:56.670 --> 00:09:59.890
I had, kind of by
default-- because I'd

00:09:59.890 --> 00:10:01.600
been the tap operator
on the sessions--

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:06.980
I knew the music on "Atom Heart
Mother," the previous album.

00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:09.380
So I got the job to mix that.

00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:12.510
And it seems I did
a reasonable job

00:10:12.510 --> 00:10:17.020
and they asked me to come in
and do "Dark Side of the Moon."

00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:20.460
So it was just literally
just a staff engineer

00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:23.900
working for the act that
had booked the studio.

00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:30.230
And I was paid 35 pounds
a week, plus overtime.

00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:32.820
So contrary to popular
belief, I did not

00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:35.950
get rich on "Dark
Side of the Moon."

00:10:35.950 --> 00:10:38.210
The problem, as you put
it, was that the band

00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:43.130
didn't seem to have
the time to come

00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:44.560
and watch me do the mixing.

00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:50.270
It wasn't a perfect mix,
it was done quickly.

00:10:50.270 --> 00:10:51.990
It was done in five or six days.

00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:55.180
It was just me and Peter
James, the tape op.

00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:58.320
And it wasn't perfect.

00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:00.010
But it had a certain magic.

00:11:00.010 --> 00:11:04.860
I think we retained a
certain something that James

00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:08.940
got through his mix in
later years did not have.

00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:12.040
But that mix is now
officially out in the shops

00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:15.260
on the immersive box set.

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:18.820
So anybody who has a surround
system, which I encourage

00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:23.480
everybody to do,
because it's great.

00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:25.270
Yeah, it's out there.

00:11:25.270 --> 00:11:27.929
Was there a specific problem
that you heard about it?

00:11:27.929 --> 00:11:28.470
AUDIENCE: No.

00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:28.760
I was just wondering.

00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:30.134
I had heard like
that they didn't

00:11:30.134 --> 00:11:32.525
think the spoken voices
were loud enough.

00:11:32.525 --> 00:11:34.651
I just heard weird
things about it.

00:11:34.651 --> 00:11:37.880
I just wondered if you
could put that to rest?

00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:39.450
ALAN PARSONS: The
band said that?

00:11:39.450 --> 00:11:40.130
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:11:40.130 --> 00:11:41.720
I just heard that they didn't
like it for some reasons.

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:43.180
I wondered what they were.

00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:45.440
ALAN PARSONS: I think
I would acknowledge

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:50.640
that there were certain things
missing because they were spun

00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:52.670
in on the final mix
and the stereo version.

00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:55.469
And I didn't know
where those tapes were.

00:11:55.469 --> 00:11:57.010
All kinds of little
things like that.

00:11:57.010 --> 00:12:01.460
Just tiny little
insurgent voices that only

00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:06.637
a real Pink Floyd connoisseur
would even notice.

00:12:06.637 --> 00:12:08.400
But it was fun.

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:09.850
It was fun to do.

00:12:09.850 --> 00:12:14.820
And I think it sounds really
good now, 40 years later.

00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:17.080
AUDIENCE: Somebody leaked
that mix a while ago.

00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:19.660
And it was available on
the internet as a rip.

00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:21.002
And before that--

00:12:21.002 --> 00:12:22.460
ALAN PARSONS: Oh,
there were plenty

00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:23.777
of bootleg versions of it.

00:12:23.777 --> 00:12:25.318
AUDIENCE: Can you
speak into the mic?

00:12:25.318 --> 00:12:25.594
AUDIENCE: Oh, yeah.

00:12:25.594 --> 00:12:26.094
I'm sorry.

00:12:26.094 --> 00:12:30.570
AUDIENCE: So you implied earlier
and talked about the changing

00:12:30.570 --> 00:12:33.900
views of what
constitutes good audio.

00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:38.210
And I'm wondering to what extent
you think those changes result

00:12:38.210 --> 00:12:43.612
from fashion and to what extent
they come from new technologies

00:12:43.612 --> 00:12:44.195
and recording?

00:12:46.835 --> 00:12:48.210
JULIAN COLBECK:
Well, one thing I

00:12:48.210 --> 00:12:49.690
was going to just
kind of briefly

00:12:49.690 --> 00:12:53.050
touch on before we get there,
but is relevant to that

00:12:53.050 --> 00:12:59.130
is that there is sound
and we are humans.

00:12:59.130 --> 00:13:01.110
And sound is what
sound is, and we

00:13:01.110 --> 00:13:04.800
can hear approximately
20 hertz to 20k,

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:08.410
given age and
infirmity, et cetera.

00:13:08.410 --> 00:13:10.692
I believe the figure--

00:13:10.692 --> 00:13:12.400
ALAN PARSONS: (MUMBLED)
As we get older--

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:13.020
[GIBBERISH]

00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:15.120
JULIAN COLBECK: It
sounds a bit [INAUDIBLE].

00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:20.370
I think we're capable of
hearing a dynamic range of one

00:13:20.370 --> 00:13:22.180
to a trillion.

00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:27.700
And an orchestra would
probably have 50 dB of--

00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:30.340
ALAN PARSONS: 40 to 50.

00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:31.670
On CD, it could be greater.

00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:33.461
On digital recordings,
it could be greater.

00:13:33.461 --> 00:13:37.690
But on vinyl and tape you were
at the mercy of the background

00:13:37.690 --> 00:13:39.530
noise.

00:13:39.530 --> 00:13:44.610
JULIAN COLBECK: So we as
humans, and sound as an entity

00:13:44.610 --> 00:13:46.660
is clearly much bigger
than any technology.

00:13:48.689 --> 00:13:50.730
ALAN PARSONS: It's a
fascinating thing, actually,

00:13:50.730 --> 00:13:51.550
to test your ear.

00:13:51.550 --> 00:13:52.925
I mean, there are
programs online

00:13:52.925 --> 00:13:56.810
to test hearing through
headphones and stuff.

00:13:56.810 --> 00:14:00.664
And you would be
quite surprised,

00:14:00.664 --> 00:14:02.580
especially if you do it
over a period of time.

00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:04.660
This young man here,
he can probably

00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:07.080
hear about 17 kilohertz.

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:09.590
And I think the highest
I can hear now is 12.

00:14:09.590 --> 00:14:10.762
JULIAN COLBECK: Really?

00:14:10.762 --> 00:14:12.550
I don't think I'm
even that high.

00:14:17.632 --> 00:14:19.090
AUDIENCE: I did
want to ask how you

00:14:19.090 --> 00:14:23.025
deal with changes
in your hearing?

00:14:23.025 --> 00:14:23.900
Any thoughts on that?

00:14:27.651 --> 00:14:28.150
I

00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:30.670
ALAN PARSONS: Think the
aging process in hearing

00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:35.740
is forgiving enough
for us to know still

00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:38.790
how to compensate for it.

00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:40.990
You don't actually notice it.

00:14:40.990 --> 00:14:44.290
I mean, good music still
sounds like good music to me.

00:14:44.290 --> 00:14:49.360
I don't sort of knowingly miss
the high frequency content

00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:52.160
that I've lost.

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:54.420
I mean, for heaven's
sake, George Martin

00:14:54.420 --> 00:14:57.060
was producing records
well into his 80s

00:14:57.060 --> 00:15:00.970
and managed to still
get good results.

00:15:00.970 --> 00:15:04.980
And to a certain extent you
can rely on others, as well.

00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:08.410
But I still feel like I
can judge a good sound

00:15:08.410 --> 00:15:11.360
with my limited hearing.

00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:14.740
I mean, I hate to use that word
but isn't getting any better

00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:17.110
and nor is it for anybody.

00:15:17.110 --> 00:15:21.560
We're all in a state
of slowly deteriorating

00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:23.720
high frequency content
in our hearing.

00:15:26.970 --> 00:15:29.630
He said the music is
in the range that--

00:15:29.630 --> 00:15:31.660
JULIAN COLBECK: Mid range.

00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:34.580
ALAN PARSONS: --the seniors
amongst us can here.

00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:40.010
But there are endless
arguments about how

00:15:40.010 --> 00:15:45.040
frequencies beyond the
normal range of hearing

00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:46.788
actually affect it.

00:15:46.788 --> 00:15:48.560
AUDIENCE: The
Zildjian aficionados.

00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:50.316
ALAN PARSONS: Zildjian
aficionados, yes.

00:15:50.316 --> 00:15:51.938
Is that what you are?

00:15:51.938 --> 00:15:54.110
AUDIENCE: I don't
hear that well.

00:15:54.110 --> 00:15:58.155
ALAN PARSONS: Yeah, I mean
technically a symbol crash is

00:15:58.155 --> 00:15:58.980
[IMITATES CRASH]

00:15:59.730 --> 00:16:01.250
And I might be hearing it as a

00:16:01.250 --> 00:16:02.289
[LOWER CRASH]

00:16:07.022 --> 00:16:08.230
AUDIENCE: Question over here.

00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:11.110
So this is a very
engineering audience here,

00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:13.500
so I'm going to leave the
psychoacoustics and some

00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:16.780
of the art elements for
later, but to start us off

00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:18.880
with a hardcore
engineering question,

00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:23.170
let's hear your
opinion about how

00:16:23.170 --> 00:16:26.140
to best optimize an audio chain.

00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:28.960
So starting with the
microphones and then

00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:32.640
like all of the other stuff
until the recording device.

00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:37.920
Where do you see in today's
technology landscape would

00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:42.290
be most utility per buck if
somebody was allocating pieces

00:16:42.290 --> 00:16:45.210
of his hard-earned
money into a chain?

00:16:48.251 --> 00:16:49.875
ALAN PARSONS: You
get what you pay for.

00:16:52.710 --> 00:16:56.930
I've never been a great
advocate of specifying

00:16:56.930 --> 00:16:59.705
a certain microphone, a certain
mic preamp, a certain chain,

00:16:59.705 --> 00:17:04.119
a certain limiter, a certain
capacitor, because in my home

00:17:04.119 --> 00:17:05.849
environment, I
know what I've got.

00:17:05.849 --> 00:17:07.470
I know how it behaves.

00:17:07.470 --> 00:17:09.750
I know how to best use it.

00:17:12.369 --> 00:17:17.000
If I walk into a studio
I've never been in before,

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.359
I'll take what they've got.

00:17:19.359 --> 00:17:21.650
There's a sort of
motto of mine, it

00:17:21.650 --> 00:17:25.240
doesn't matter what it
is, we'll make it great.

00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:30.492
I'm not going to line up to 10
different microphones and A-B

00:17:30.492 --> 00:17:32.950
one against the other and ten
different mic preamps and ten

00:17:32.950 --> 00:17:37.870
different A to D
converters or whatever.

00:17:37.870 --> 00:17:41.535
I'm just going to say, well,
let's see how it sounds.

00:17:41.535 --> 00:17:42.120
Yeah.

00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:42.630
Sounds good.

00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:43.355
Let's go with it.

00:17:43.355 --> 00:17:44.730
JULIAN COLBECK:
I'm thinking back

00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:49.110
in the day in the '70s
or '60s and '70s, there

00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:51.390
were no such thing as
kind of separate mic pre's

00:17:51.390 --> 00:17:52.230
that you chose.

00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:52.960
It was the desk.

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:55.640
And the mic pre's were
whatever was on the desk.

00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:58.277
And I think one of
the points that Alan

00:17:58.277 --> 00:18:01.340
makes throughout this book
and the series is not so much

00:18:01.340 --> 00:18:04.030
that you have to have this
particular widget, gadget,

00:18:04.030 --> 00:18:07.104
plugin, whatever in
order to make this music,

00:18:07.104 --> 00:18:08.520
but you need the
knowledge to make

00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:11.260
whatever you have sound good.

00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:13.070
And that is a very
important point.

00:18:13.070 --> 00:18:15.820
Because I think if
you have the ability

00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:19.480
to get a decent recording
out of a modest mic

00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:24.870
or in a modest environment,
then you can do anything.

00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:28.260
But if you are only capable of
EQ-ing something on a Fairchild

00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:32.317
or only capable--
you're very limited.

00:18:32.317 --> 00:18:34.400
ALAN PARSONS: There's one
story in the book, which

00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:38.136
which when you get it, as I hope
you will-- I see a lot of you

00:18:38.136 --> 00:18:41.360
got it already--
Sylvia Massy, who

00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:46.100
is a celebrated
engineer originally

00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:50.850
from one of the
southern states, anyway

00:18:50.850 --> 00:18:53.050
she's a very, very
respected engineer.

00:18:53.050 --> 00:18:57.790
She had a producer
who insisted that they

00:18:57.790 --> 00:18:59.930
try a whole bunch of
different microphones

00:18:59.930 --> 00:19:02.080
to make sure that
they were getting

00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:03.420
the best possible vocal sound.

00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:06.380
So they lined up literally
tens of thousands

00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:08.000
of dollars worth
of microphones--

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:13.230
a Norman 47, a
Telefunken 451, AKG C 12,

00:19:13.230 --> 00:19:18.650
all kinds of mics-- and
also some cheaper mics.

00:19:18.650 --> 00:19:22.520
Notably a Shure 57.

00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:24.774
And guess what one?

00:19:24.774 --> 00:19:25.930
$100 microphone.

00:19:25.930 --> 00:19:30.760
SM 57 won the shootout
for best vocal sound.

00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:32.535
I mean it's unbelievable.

00:19:32.535 --> 00:19:34.160
JULIAN COLBECK: But
I think that now we

00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:39.180
do live in a kind of very gear
obsessed and obsessive world.

00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:45.430
I think that in the kind of
hey day of analogue recording,

00:19:45.430 --> 00:19:48.700
I mean, was there such a
kind of an obsession with

00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:49.300
the equipment?

00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:51.300
Or was it more--

00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:52.430
ALAN PARSONS: No.

00:19:52.430 --> 00:19:54.310
I mean it was down
to the relationship

00:19:54.310 --> 00:19:56.250
between the artist and
producer and engineer.

00:19:56.250 --> 00:20:01.280
The producer was
there to make sure

00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:04.160
that the artist performed well.

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:08.030
And he would very much rely
on the skills of the engineer

00:20:08.030 --> 00:20:12.820
to balance the best sound.

00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:15.860
When I first started
at Abbey Road Studios,

00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:18.880
we were called
Balance Engineers, not

00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:22.099
Recording Engineers.

00:20:22.099 --> 00:20:23.640
So the tape operators
were officially

00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:24.894
known as button pushers.

00:20:24.894 --> 00:20:26.060
So that's how I started off.

00:20:26.060 --> 00:20:29.910
I started off as a button
pusher and then graduated

00:20:29.910 --> 00:20:33.590
to being a balance engineer.

00:20:33.590 --> 00:20:36.600
But I think it's
true to say that so

00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:40.240
much of the art of
engineering is about balance.

00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:46.420
Just finding the right
mix between instruments,

00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:48.750
the vocals, effects, whatever.

00:20:48.750 --> 00:20:50.970
It's all about the balance.

00:20:50.970 --> 00:20:57.520
And the skill of the engineer
is to balance the sound such

00:20:57.520 --> 00:21:00.300
that it brings the
best out of the artist

00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:02.370
and gives the producer
what he wants.

00:21:05.034 --> 00:21:06.575
You going to pass
the mic back there?

00:21:06.575 --> 00:21:07.510
Oh, you got it already.

00:21:07.510 --> 00:21:08.135
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:21:08.135 --> 00:21:10.030
Got it right here.

00:21:10.030 --> 00:21:11.740
Thanks very much for
coming down here.

00:21:11.740 --> 00:21:12.790
Very cool.

00:21:12.790 --> 00:21:14.240
Great to see you guys.

00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:15.617
But I got the book.

00:21:15.617 --> 00:21:17.200
I'm going to read
it, but I would just

00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:20.520
love for you guys to just
walk through the high level

00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:23.305
kind of elevator
pitch of production.

00:21:23.305 --> 00:21:24.930
We all have our home
studios, we're all

00:21:24.930 --> 00:21:27.410
passionate about
music in some respect,

00:21:27.410 --> 00:21:29.430
and we all have
our own homegrown

00:21:29.430 --> 00:21:31.680
like what we gather
together and piece together

00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:34.159
to get these represented song
ideas that are in our heads

00:21:34.159 --> 00:21:35.450
to get them out into the world.

00:21:35.450 --> 00:21:38.370
But it'd be great to just
hear you guys walk through,

00:21:38.370 --> 00:21:40.526
like you start
with the song idea,

00:21:40.526 --> 00:21:43.150
then you get a click track, you
figure out the arrangement, you

00:21:43.150 --> 00:21:44.950
get the arrangement
on a click track,

00:21:44.950 --> 00:21:47.500
and then take us through
kind of like the steps,

00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:50.520
whether you do drums first,
or you record a rhythm

00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:53.960
guitar that the drummer plays
to, and then how you overdub,

00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:57.380
the pros and cons of
doing a live recording

00:21:57.380 --> 00:22:00.020
with multiple people or
just starting with drums,

00:22:00.020 --> 00:22:03.800
then doing bass, how do
you see that going out

00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:05.180
into a home studio?

00:22:05.180 --> 00:22:07.050
JULIAN COLBECK: I think you've
named all the ways of doing it.

00:22:07.050 --> 00:22:08.550
ALAN PARSONS: The
piecemeal approach

00:22:08.550 --> 00:22:11.030
is something I've
never supported.

00:22:11.030 --> 00:22:15.360
I've always tried to get at
least three or four people

00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:17.406
playing together at once.

00:22:17.406 --> 00:22:18.280
The more the merrier.

00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:21.550
The more they interact,
the better the feel is.

00:22:21.550 --> 00:22:23.480
If it's just a bass
player and a click track,

00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:24.980
it's not going to
be exciting is it?

00:22:24.980 --> 00:22:26.810
I mean, let's face it.

00:22:26.810 --> 00:22:31.670
And I've always
supported the notion

00:22:31.670 --> 00:22:34.567
that if you're going to
make a rock and roll record,

00:22:34.567 --> 00:22:35.650
have a rock and roll band.

00:22:37.690 --> 00:22:41.900
I recognize that people do it.

00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:45.030
JULIAN COLBECK: I was going to
say that technology does allow

00:22:45.030 --> 00:22:47.650
you to do what you only can
do and most people don't

00:22:47.650 --> 00:22:50.536
have access to an entire band or
anyplace that they could record

00:22:50.536 --> 00:22:51.910
that band and
therefore you start

00:22:51.910 --> 00:22:53.530
with a click track and a bass.

00:22:53.530 --> 00:22:54.810
And can you make good records?

00:22:54.810 --> 00:22:56.650
I think you can.

00:22:56.650 --> 00:23:01.790
But I think my kind
of take on an approach

00:23:01.790 --> 00:23:07.290
to recording-- years ago there
were physical limitations.

00:23:07.290 --> 00:23:11.710
Limitations in the number of
tracks that a multitrack tape

00:23:11.710 --> 00:23:14.580
could offer-- 8 track,
16, whatever it is.

00:23:14.580 --> 00:23:16.740
Limitations in time,
the budget that you

00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:19.009
had to go into a studio,
now all of those things

00:23:19.009 --> 00:23:19.800
are out the window.

00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:22.120
You can have as many
tracks as you want

00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:24.400
and as much time as
you want, but that

00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:26.810
means you never finish anything.

00:23:26.810 --> 00:23:33.840
And I think the problem, why so
much kind of own solo recorded,

00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:36.200
in every sense of the
word, music sounds

00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:40.290
a little bit under par
is that it's overcooked.

00:23:40.290 --> 00:23:41.770
You spent too much time on it.

00:23:41.770 --> 00:23:44.290
And I think that one thing
you can do to kind of create

00:23:44.290 --> 00:23:45.480
the kind of rock
and roll excitement,

00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:46.896
which obviously
would be wonderful

00:23:46.896 --> 00:23:49.710
if you're doing rock and roll,
is to impose limitations.

00:23:49.710 --> 00:23:52.360
Say I'm going to get
it done by tonight.

00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:52.930
That's it.

00:23:52.930 --> 00:23:58.840
And to inject some
excitement or be it falsely,

00:23:58.840 --> 00:24:02.780
but I think that is an
approach which can be good.

00:24:02.780 --> 00:24:04.620
ALAN PARSONS: There
was an experiment

00:24:04.620 --> 00:24:08.630
done maybe three
or four years ago

00:24:08.630 --> 00:24:12.410
with Geoff Emerick, the
original Beatles engineer,

00:24:12.410 --> 00:24:17.640
with a couple of bands who
effectively re-recorded

00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:18.800
a couple of Beatles' songs.

00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:22.140
Did anybody see this
documentary about this?

00:24:22.140 --> 00:24:25.190
It was fairly well protected.

00:24:25.190 --> 00:24:29.310
I don't think a lot
of people saw it.

00:24:29.310 --> 00:24:32.310
But the discipline for a
modern band in the studio

00:24:32.310 --> 00:24:37.060
is, I mean, a guy sings
his heart out flat

00:24:37.060 --> 00:24:38.280
all the way through.

00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:39.910
And the producer
says, it sucked.

00:24:39.910 --> 00:24:40.540
Come and have a listen.

00:24:40.540 --> 00:24:41.120
We'll fix it.

00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:47.820
And these bands were really
having quite a hard time

00:24:47.820 --> 00:24:51.640
actually getting through an
entire song, playing together,

00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:55.400
and then having to do complete
vocal performances and stuff

00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:56.620
like that.

00:24:56.620 --> 00:24:58.130
The way it used to be.

00:24:58.130 --> 00:25:04.528
And that's an indication we've
become very forgiving, I think,

00:25:04.528 --> 00:25:07.590
of what talent is.

00:25:07.590 --> 00:25:14.100
There are a lot of extremely
mediocre talent out there

00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:15.200
that make millions.

00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:20.350
And it's because the technology
allows them to be that way.

00:25:20.350 --> 00:25:24.190
It's really true now.

00:25:24.190 --> 00:25:26.409
And, you know, it's
not as if I don't

00:25:26.409 --> 00:25:27.700
take advantage of those things.

00:25:27.700 --> 00:25:33.760
I mean, I use autotune just like
everybody else but sparingly.

00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:36.440
JULIAN COLBECK: Don't you
think also that to some degree

00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:39.440
your character is defined
by your limitations.

00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:41.630
So if you can't have no
limitations because you're

00:25:41.630 --> 00:25:45.060
perfectly in tune
and perfectly in time

00:25:45.060 --> 00:25:47.450
it's probably going
to sound dull as mud.

00:25:47.450 --> 00:25:49.360
I mean, what makes a
performance exciting

00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:51.610
is that you're on the edge,
you're almost falling off,

00:25:51.610 --> 00:25:52.630
you get back.

00:25:52.630 --> 00:25:56.270
That's what creates
that kind of energy.

00:25:56.270 --> 00:25:59.110
So I think imperfections
are good and should

00:25:59.110 --> 00:26:02.730
be justly protected.

00:26:02.730 --> 00:26:04.000
Leave them in.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:09.734
I mean, there's a space of
multitracks floating around

00:26:09.734 --> 00:26:10.400
on the internet.

00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:13.795
You can hear all of John
Lennon's solo vocals

00:26:13.795 --> 00:26:17.390
and everybody's kind of revealed
in naked form these days,

00:26:17.390 --> 00:26:21.640
but if you hear those tracks,
I mean, the vocal take

00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:24.350
on "Imagine", I mean he's
up and down in pitch.

00:26:24.350 --> 00:26:26.040
It's all over the place.

00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:30.230
But it was an
incredible performance.

00:26:30.230 --> 00:26:33.200
But if you do what you do
now, which is solo everything,

00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:37.250
everything can be viewed
in isolation and processed.

00:26:37.250 --> 00:26:40.130
That performance would have
never been allowed to happen.

00:26:40.130 --> 00:26:42.010
And that's pretty
obviously crazy

00:26:42.010 --> 00:26:43.848
because it was good
that it did happen.

00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:55.690
So I think limitations
are worth preserving.

00:26:55.690 --> 00:27:00.770
And also, one quick other thing,
you mentioned psychoacoustics,

00:27:00.770 --> 00:27:04.390
I think that one of the things
that the brain, what music is,

00:27:04.390 --> 00:27:07.350
comedown to that fairly
deep kind of idea.

00:27:10.070 --> 00:27:13.380
If you have repetition,
it will kind of

00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:14.500
put your brain to sleep.

00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:16.530
If you hear a ticking
clock, you will eventually

00:27:16.530 --> 00:27:17.238
just not hear it.

00:27:17.238 --> 00:27:20.090
Or a train constantly
running past the door.

00:27:20.090 --> 00:27:24.055
It is sound changing that
keeps that tickles the ear

00:27:24.055 --> 00:27:25.125
and keeps it interesting.

00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:30.510
ALAN PARSONS: That was
one of the premises

00:27:30.510 --> 00:27:32.330
that MP3 was based on.

00:27:32.330 --> 00:27:36.220
We only take away what
the ear can't discern.

00:27:36.220 --> 00:27:38.140
JULIAN COLBECK: Right.

00:27:38.140 --> 00:27:38.640
They say.

00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:40.654
ALAN PARSONS: But clearly
they got it wrong.

00:27:40.654 --> 00:27:41.570
JULIAN COLBECK: Right.

00:27:41.570 --> 00:27:42.070
Exactly.

00:27:42.070 --> 00:27:46.445
That's a pretty big kind
of imposition to make.

00:27:49.330 --> 00:27:53.050
ALAN PARSONS: If I just
could rant a little bit more

00:27:53.050 --> 00:27:53.615
about MP3.

00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:05.315
It is such a shame that
iTunes and even Google Play

00:28:05.315 --> 00:28:08.690
are still essentially
based on MP3.

00:28:08.690 --> 00:28:13.570
On my own website I'm
offering our latest release

00:28:13.570 --> 00:28:16.635
in high resolution,
24-bit, as a WAV

00:28:16.635 --> 00:28:19.210
file for less
money than the MP3.

00:28:19.210 --> 00:28:20.247
[APPLAUSE]

00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:30.220
So I think if people could
be educated to simply listen

00:28:30.220 --> 00:28:34.380
to the differences
between MP3 and WAVs

00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:39.680
or high resolution files over
a period of time, I mean,

00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:41.010
an MP3 it's OK.

00:28:41.010 --> 00:28:42.700
It's OK.

00:28:42.700 --> 00:28:44.110
It's all there.

00:28:44.110 --> 00:28:45.440
But where is the magic?

00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:48.890
It does just suck out
the magic from the music.

00:28:48.890 --> 00:28:54.070
And that's terribly sad.

00:28:54.070 --> 00:28:58.140
And there are streaming
services out there

00:28:58.140 --> 00:28:59.720
which are pretty good.

00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:04.390
I mean, they're
still compressed.

00:29:04.390 --> 00:29:09.720
They use a lot more of
the data than an MP3 does.

00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:11.820
I've been listening
to Slacker lately.

00:29:11.820 --> 00:29:17.780
I think it sounds really
good compared to-- Oh,

00:29:17.780 --> 00:29:21.710
the winner of the worse sound
of all is satellite radio.

00:29:21.710 --> 00:29:24.960
I hope none of you are renewing
your subscriptions to XM radio,

00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:27.480
to Sirius XM because
it totally sucks.

00:29:29.990 --> 00:29:35.180
But I just want to
see a brighter future

00:29:35.180 --> 00:29:38.090
as we progress in digital
audio and downloads and stuff.

00:29:41.672 --> 00:29:44.410
The capability of
high quality is there.

00:29:44.410 --> 00:29:47.730
It's just that we're
worried about taking

00:29:47.730 --> 00:29:50.570
20 minutes to download a
song instead of 3 minutes

00:29:50.570 --> 00:29:53.890
and taking up extra
space in our hard drives.

00:29:53.890 --> 00:29:56.110
Hard drives are getting
bigger, why worry?

00:29:56.110 --> 00:30:04.940
So I just encourage everybody
to look at high definition audio

00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:07.180
and let's improve what
we're listening to.

00:30:10.540 --> 00:30:11.500
Sir.

00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:14.070
AUDIENCE: First of all,
thanks for coming in.

00:30:14.070 --> 00:30:14.440
ALAN PARSONS: Oh,
you're very welcome.

00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:16.080
AUDIENCE: I'm a big fan
of your work both behind

00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:17.230
and in front of the console.

00:30:17.230 --> 00:30:19.479
And I wanted to ask you a
little bit about that, which

00:30:19.479 --> 00:30:24.820
is how much did your knowledge
of capturing and reproducing

00:30:24.820 --> 00:30:28.350
sound inform your
own music work?

00:30:31.670 --> 00:30:36.500
ALAN PARSONS: I think it
was very, very important.

00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:39.260
But I'm a little
bit of a passenger

00:30:39.260 --> 00:30:41.980
when it comes to
playing on stage.

00:30:41.980 --> 00:30:47.000
I know my background is
in producing, engineering.

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:49.410
It just so happens I can play
three chords on the guitar

00:30:49.410 --> 00:30:53.505
and so I get away
with it on stage.

00:30:53.505 --> 00:30:56.320
And I've even come out of my
shell a bit in recent years

00:30:56.320 --> 00:30:59.510
and even started singing a bit.

00:30:59.510 --> 00:31:03.380
But it all stems from
the learning process,

00:31:03.380 --> 00:31:10.270
growing up in recording studios
and seeing what could be done.

00:31:10.270 --> 00:31:15.850
I always supported orchestras
and orchestral arrangements

00:31:15.850 --> 00:31:18.070
being a part of what I did.

00:31:18.070 --> 00:31:20.540
That's been a little bit of a
disappointment over the years

00:31:20.540 --> 00:31:22.460
because budgets
just simply don't

00:31:22.460 --> 00:31:26.000
allow to have a band
and an orchestra,

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:28.069
although we've done
a couple of shows

00:31:28.069 --> 00:31:30.110
with a symphony orchestra,
which have been great.

00:31:32.970 --> 00:31:36.430
But there's an influence,
but I surround myself

00:31:36.430 --> 00:31:42.135
with great musicians
and they do the work.

00:31:42.135 --> 00:31:44.820
I'm actually more there
as a sort of manager,

00:31:44.820 --> 00:31:46.040
just like I am in the studio.

00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:51.060
I'm kind of the band producer
as opposed to the band leader.

00:31:51.060 --> 00:31:52.281
Does that kind of answer?

00:31:52.281 --> 00:31:52.781
Good.

00:31:56.370 --> 00:31:59.040
AUDIENCE: Coming back
to MP3 and file format.

00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:02.690
So MP3 obviously is not good
enough, what is good enough?

00:32:02.690 --> 00:32:05.230
I mean, when does
it become overkill?

00:32:05.230 --> 00:32:07.660
96 kilo hertz, 192?

00:32:07.660 --> 00:32:08.530
DSD?

00:32:08.530 --> 00:32:11.120
What would you choose?

00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:13.750
ALAN PARSONS: That will
probably remain an argument

00:32:13.750 --> 00:32:15.980
forever and a day.

00:32:15.980 --> 00:32:19.130
I'm happy with 96 24.

00:32:21.941 --> 00:32:23.176
AUDIENCE: What about DSD?

00:32:23.176 --> 00:32:24.300
Do you hear the difference?

00:32:24.300 --> 00:32:26.379
I know it's hard to edit in DSD.

00:32:26.379 --> 00:32:28.295
ALAN PARSONS: I've had
no experience with DSD.

00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:35.400
I mean, I think it sounds great.

00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:38.990
The disks I've heard in DSD
sound really, really good.

00:32:38.990 --> 00:32:42.330
But I have not had
the opportunity

00:32:42.330 --> 00:32:46.420
to compare them directly
with any other systems.

00:32:46.420 --> 00:32:49.626
But I think DSD is history now?

00:32:49.626 --> 00:32:50.500
AUDIENCE: Not really.

00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:54.000
I think it's surviving
now online especially.

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:56.642
It's mostly for direct
recording I think,

00:32:56.642 --> 00:32:57.850
since you cannot really edit.

00:32:57.850 --> 00:33:00.290
So classical music
concerts, one shot.

00:33:04.140 --> 00:33:06.240
ALAN PARSONS: Yes.

00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:09.229
It was always
traditionally accepted

00:33:09.229 --> 00:33:10.770
that if you were a
Hi-Fi nut that you

00:33:10.770 --> 00:33:12.380
listen to classical music.

00:33:12.380 --> 00:33:16.150
I think that's kind of changed.

00:33:16.150 --> 00:33:20.195
I mean, rock music I think has a
place in the audiophile's home.

00:33:26.035 --> 00:33:28.660
Rock and pop engineers work just
as hard as classical engineers

00:33:28.660 --> 00:33:31.440
to get a good sound,
so why shouldn't we

00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:35.240
have the benefit of
audiophile technology?

00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:36.930
But it's interesting,
there's always

00:33:36.930 --> 00:33:42.800
been this strange dividing line
between pro audio and consumer

00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:44.180
Hi-Fi.

00:33:44.180 --> 00:33:47.200
And we have completely
different parameters

00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:49.520
that seem important to us.

00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:53.710
I mean, the Hi-Fi nut
will say my cable has

00:33:53.710 --> 00:33:56.090
gold plated connectors
and its oxygen free

00:33:56.090 --> 00:33:58.640
and it's only two feet long.

00:33:58.640 --> 00:34:01.340
Whereas your cable it doesn't
have gold plated cables

00:34:01.340 --> 00:34:02.650
and it's 20 feet long.

00:34:02.650 --> 00:34:03.900
Can't you hear the difference?

00:34:03.900 --> 00:34:04.399
Nope.

00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:11.699
And there were all kinds of
some strange, quirky stuff.

00:34:11.699 --> 00:34:13.989
And they're like if
you took a pencil

00:34:13.989 --> 00:34:17.100
and you drew a cross on
a CD with this magic pen

00:34:17.100 --> 00:34:19.209
and it would sound better.

00:34:19.209 --> 00:34:21.000
JULIAN COLBECK: Along
with the [INAUDIBLE],

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:22.083
I think, know what I mean?

00:34:22.083 --> 00:34:23.790
ALAN PARSONS: Just
incredible stuff.

00:34:23.790 --> 00:34:26.139
But it's good to see
vinyl coming back.

00:34:26.139 --> 00:34:31.460
It's good to see that vinyl
is being recognized as a--

00:34:31.460 --> 00:34:35.007
JULIAN COLBECK: What's
your take on the high end?

00:34:35.007 --> 00:34:37.090
Do you think you can hear
a substantial difference

00:34:37.090 --> 00:34:41.440
in the high end on vinyl
as opposed to a CD?

00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:43.330
ALAN PARSONS: It's
not just the high end.

00:34:43.330 --> 00:34:46.159
Oh, by the way, vinyl, for the
younger people in the audience,

00:34:46.159 --> 00:34:47.409
those are those big black CDs.

00:34:47.409 --> 00:34:48.909
JULIAN COLBECK:
It's not a suitcase.

00:34:50.899 --> 00:34:52.440
ALAN PARSONS: There's
one over there.

00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:53.710
JULIAN COLBECK: It's the
things your dad's briefcase is

00:34:53.710 --> 00:34:54.239
made out of.

00:34:56.799 --> 00:35:00.090
ALAN PARSONS: You
know, analog, vinyl, it

00:35:00.090 --> 00:35:05.910
has that vibrancy that does
get lost in digital recordings.

00:35:05.910 --> 00:35:08.784
That's coming from somebody
who supports digital recording.

00:35:08.784 --> 00:35:10.200
I've been recording
digitally ever

00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:14.300
since I could back
in the mid '80s.

00:35:14.300 --> 00:35:16.360
JULIAN COLBECK: But vinyl
had a problem with bass

00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:16.970
though didn't it?

00:35:16.970 --> 00:35:18.735
I mean you couldn't
put the level of bass

00:35:18.735 --> 00:35:22.930
that an EDM artist would
now find essential,

00:35:22.930 --> 00:35:24.655
you couldn't count
that could you?

00:35:24.655 --> 00:35:25.912
I wouldn't have though.

00:35:25.912 --> 00:35:26.620
ALAN PARSONS: No.

00:35:26.620 --> 00:35:30.000
In fact, I talked to Geoff
Emerick, the Beatles engineer,

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.420
at [INAUDIBLE]
just the other day.

00:35:32.420 --> 00:35:38.190
And he said there's a
lot of current recordings

00:35:38.190 --> 00:35:42.140
which are simply uncuttable
to vinyl because there are

00:35:42.140 --> 00:35:44.990
phase problems and
excessive bass.

00:35:44.990 --> 00:35:49.000
That it just can't be done
without cutting the level way,

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:49.500
way down.

00:35:52.450 --> 00:35:57.390
That was some in
criticism to the fact

00:35:57.390 --> 00:35:59.880
that engineers aren't
trained like they used to be.

00:35:59.880 --> 00:36:02.730
I mean, Jeff and I both started
at the bottom at Abbey Road,

00:36:02.730 --> 00:36:05.820
you know, working in
the tape library then.

00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:09.390
Moving on to sessions as
tape ops, button pushers,

00:36:09.390 --> 00:36:11.100
as I mentioned earlier.

00:36:11.100 --> 00:36:15.210
And then most assisted
engineers then

00:36:15.210 --> 00:36:17.280
became cutting room engineers.

00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:19.700
They would go and cut
for a couple of years.

00:36:19.700 --> 00:36:22.220
Cut vinyl.

00:36:22.220 --> 00:36:27.210
I actually skipped that step,
but Jeff was a great mastering

00:36:27.210 --> 00:36:29.760
engineer as well as
a great recording

00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:32.350
engineer in later years.

00:36:32.350 --> 00:36:35.022
But that was the
way the training

00:36:35.022 --> 00:36:35.980
happened at Abbey Road.

00:36:35.980 --> 00:36:37.856
And it was very valuable.

00:36:37.856 --> 00:36:39.480
And it just speaks
for itself, I think,

00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:43.000
that so many engineers--
myself included--

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:45.050
made a name for
themselves because

00:36:45.050 --> 00:36:46.140
of that great background.

00:36:49.790 --> 00:36:52.740
AUDIENCE: So my
question is mainly

00:36:52.740 --> 00:36:56.400
on the consumer technology.

00:36:56.400 --> 00:37:03.812
If you listen to $1,000 set up,
$5,000, to $20,000 to $50,000

00:37:03.812 --> 00:37:11.250
to $100,000 set up, you
hear material difference.

00:37:11.250 --> 00:37:15.390
And so it looks like even good
music is going to the elite.

00:37:15.390 --> 00:37:18.200
And our profession,
and engineers

00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:22.300
and our side basically software
developers, our main focus

00:37:22.300 --> 00:37:25.840
is to make sure that the
software is for the masses,

00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:27.800
not just for the elite.

00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:31.430
Do engineers on the audio
side have such consciousness

00:37:31.430 --> 00:37:34.685
to or not?

00:37:34.685 --> 00:37:35.810
JULIAN COLBECK: Absolutely.

00:37:35.810 --> 00:37:40.510
ALAN PARSONS: There was
always this argument,

00:37:40.510 --> 00:37:44.589
is music on a better system
more enjoyable because it's

00:37:44.589 --> 00:37:45.380
on a better system?

00:37:45.380 --> 00:37:46.754
The answer is no.

00:37:46.754 --> 00:37:51.570
If the music is there and
the information is not

00:37:51.570 --> 00:37:57.380
being sucked out of it by
digital media, digital means,

00:37:57.380 --> 00:38:00.160
then, you know,
I listen to music

00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:02.860
at home on a
receiver from Costco.

00:38:06.260 --> 00:38:09.050
The speaker is this size.

00:38:09.050 --> 00:38:11.500
I enjoy it just as much
as I do in the studio.

00:38:14.780 --> 00:38:19.862
One of the sad things about
the way listening to music

00:38:19.862 --> 00:38:21.570
for the consumer has
gone in recent years

00:38:21.570 --> 00:38:24.300
is you can't get people
to sit down and listen

00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:26.835
to 50 minutes of music anymore.

00:38:26.835 --> 00:38:31.830
The phone rings, they've got
their email to catch up on.

00:38:31.830 --> 00:38:34.620
They've got 500 TV
channels to watch.

00:38:34.620 --> 00:38:35.670
They've got video games.

00:38:35.670 --> 00:38:38.890
They've got all these
incredible distractions.

00:38:42.050 --> 00:38:45.060
The concept of
buying a shiny new LP

00:38:45.060 --> 00:38:47.430
and taking it home, putting
it on the record player,

00:38:47.430 --> 00:38:52.820
turning the lights down,
lighting up a cigarette,

00:38:52.820 --> 00:38:56.217
and just spending a
little while listening.

00:38:56.217 --> 00:38:57.050
Those days are gone.

00:38:57.050 --> 00:38:59.730
People don't do that anymore.

00:38:59.730 --> 00:39:02.785
And I would really like to see
that coming back, if possible.

00:39:02.785 --> 00:39:05.160
JULIAN COLBECK: I think also
just to close on your point.

00:39:05.160 --> 00:39:07.990
There's a difference
between the system used

00:39:07.990 --> 00:39:12.740
to create a piece of music and
a system used to simply hear

00:39:12.740 --> 00:39:13.880
what has been created.

00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:17.400
And I think if you had a
very modest system that

00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:19.510
was used to create
the piece of music,

00:39:19.510 --> 00:39:22.820
it would be very difficult to
get the kind of high quality

00:39:22.820 --> 00:39:27.270
recordings on a very Lo-Fi
or modest playback system.

00:39:27.270 --> 00:39:30.100
But if you've created it well,
then I think, as Alan said,

00:39:30.100 --> 00:39:31.850
it can translate.

00:39:31.850 --> 00:39:34.480
And in the studio that
was a very important part

00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:39.200
to play a track back in mono, to
play a track on small speakers,

00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:43.027
and to make sure that the energy
that was in there being played

00:39:43.027 --> 00:39:44.610
on these enormous
speakers where there

00:39:44.610 --> 00:39:47.115
is fantastic quality,
still translated.

00:39:47.115 --> 00:39:48.740
And so I think to
answer your question,

00:39:48.740 --> 00:39:53.000
engineers did, and were,
and are very mindful of that

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:55.504
not everybody is listening
to them like that.

00:39:55.504 --> 00:39:57.170
ALAN PARSONS:
Unfortunately the consumer

00:39:57.170 --> 00:40:00.770
has a record of always
getting it wrong.

00:40:00.770 --> 00:40:06.700
Consumer chose VHS over Betamax,
they chose DVD over Laser Disk.

00:40:06.700 --> 00:40:08.870
Laser Disk was far superior.

00:40:08.870 --> 00:40:11.190
They chose cassette
over 8 tracks.

00:40:11.190 --> 00:40:13.760
8 tracks were superior.

00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:15.616
Just making that point.

00:40:15.616 --> 00:40:17.120
And they've now chosen MP3s.

00:40:21.950 --> 00:40:23.158
AUDIENCE: CD is way superior.

00:40:23.158 --> 00:40:24.365
Those are WAV files.

00:40:24.365 --> 00:40:25.240
ALAN PARSONS: Indeed.

00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:25.800
Yeah.

00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:26.747
AUDIENCE: So MP3s.

00:40:26.747 --> 00:40:29.640
Why do they listen
to so many MP3s?

00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:32.450
ALAN PARSONS: You tell me.

00:40:32.450 --> 00:40:35.300
JULIAN COLBECK: Well, they're
easier to move around.

00:40:35.300 --> 00:40:37.140
ALAN PARSONS: It's
just convenience.

00:40:37.140 --> 00:40:39.210
And it's great in
professional circles.

00:40:39.210 --> 00:40:41.100
MP3s are a godsend.

00:40:41.100 --> 00:40:45.850
I send my own tracks
around to musicians

00:40:45.850 --> 00:40:48.110
so they can learn
songs and stuff.

00:40:48.110 --> 00:40:49.740
It's ideal.

00:40:49.740 --> 00:40:55.800
But when it comes to sitting
down and being entertained,

00:40:55.800 --> 00:41:01.760
the high res audio
needs to be appreciated.

00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:02.570
It really does.

00:41:05.436 --> 00:41:07.200
AUDIENCE: So I've
heard both of you

00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:09.880
talk about a couple
times about how

00:41:09.880 --> 00:41:12.380
something when it sounds good.

00:41:12.380 --> 00:41:15.670
And I have to guess that
what your opinion of what

00:41:15.670 --> 00:41:18.010
sounds good was informed
by years and years

00:41:18.010 --> 00:41:21.670
in the studio coming
up from being a tape op

00:41:21.670 --> 00:41:24.950
and being an assistant
engineer and all that.

00:41:24.950 --> 00:41:29.490
Any words of advice on how
jerks like me in my bedroom

00:41:29.490 --> 00:41:36.940
can start to develop that skill
to understand what sounds good?

00:41:36.940 --> 00:41:38.440
And, obviously,
there's a personal--

00:41:38.440 --> 00:41:40.590
ALAN PARSONS: There's
this marvelous book.

00:41:40.590 --> 00:41:41.520
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:41.520 --> 00:41:43.200
JULIAN COLBECK: Oh, Alan.

00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:45.399
AUDIENCE: I was afraid you
were going to say that.

00:41:45.399 --> 00:41:46.690
ALAN PARSONS: And a DVD series.

00:41:49.270 --> 00:41:53.070
That's really why we did
the book and the DVD.

00:41:53.070 --> 00:41:56.170
Just to try and lift
the veil a little bit

00:41:56.170 --> 00:42:01.309
and lift the mysteries
of the recording studio.

00:42:01.309 --> 00:42:03.850
JULIAN COLBECK: But I think one
of the things that Alan said,

00:42:03.850 --> 00:42:07.910
which I definitely pass on is
just learning how to listen.

00:42:07.910 --> 00:42:11.210
And one of the things he did
at Abbey Road like any engineer

00:42:11.210 --> 00:42:16.140
there would do is orchestra one
day, rock band the next day,

00:42:16.140 --> 00:42:17.630
spoken word.

00:42:17.630 --> 00:42:19.310
All day long you're
being exposed

00:42:19.310 --> 00:42:21.100
to different sounds,
different music.

00:42:21.100 --> 00:42:23.530
And over the course
of time, hey presto,

00:42:23.530 --> 00:42:27.632
like being fit as an
athlete, you are trained.

00:42:27.632 --> 00:42:29.090
I think that learning
how to listen

00:42:29.090 --> 00:42:30.682
is certainly a sort of thread.

00:42:30.682 --> 00:42:32.765
ALAN PARSONS: Interestingly,
when I first started,

00:42:32.765 --> 00:42:34.223
of course, everything
sounded great

00:42:34.223 --> 00:42:36.790
because it was coming out of
this wonderful studio system.

00:42:36.790 --> 00:42:41.520
And then this engineer gets a
different kind of piano sound

00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:44.540
to this engineer and that's
because he uses this mic, that

00:42:44.540 --> 00:42:48.490
mic, he positions
it this certain way.

00:42:48.490 --> 00:42:50.890
So it was just a constant
learning process.

00:42:50.890 --> 00:42:54.960
And then you develop
your own style

00:42:54.960 --> 00:42:57.100
through watching other people.

00:42:57.100 --> 00:43:00.620
And suddenly it wasn't
just good sound every day.

00:43:00.620 --> 00:43:02.310
It was a good
piano sound, not so

00:43:02.310 --> 00:43:05.390
good vocal sound,
nice guitar sound.

00:43:05.390 --> 00:43:09.020
And then you just meld all
the influences together

00:43:09.020 --> 00:43:12.085
and create your own
engineering identity.

00:43:12.085 --> 00:43:12.960
JULIAN COLBECK: Yeah.

00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:14.918
It's just developing your
own I think isn't it?

00:43:14.918 --> 00:43:16.690
Really, at the end of the day.

00:43:16.690 --> 00:43:21.540
When we made the DVD series,
one of the scenes and chapters

00:43:21.540 --> 00:43:23.817
in the books was a
band tracking session.

00:43:23.817 --> 00:43:25.400
It was a really
interesting experience

00:43:25.400 --> 00:43:31.610
because Alan wrote a song, did
a little demo on a keyboard.

00:43:31.610 --> 00:43:36.613
We got wonderful musicians in
a studio to learn this song

00:43:36.613 --> 00:43:37.860
and to play it.

00:43:37.860 --> 00:43:39.967
And so we're in the studio
and he plays the song

00:43:39.967 --> 00:43:42.050
and they're all, OK, and
the take down some notes.

00:43:42.050 --> 00:43:43.510
And they got a
little chord chart

00:43:43.510 --> 00:43:49.040
and off they go into the
studio and start running

00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:50.980
through this song which
they had never before.

00:43:50.980 --> 00:43:54.330
And it kind of just
sounded more or less

00:43:54.330 --> 00:43:57.660
like the demo on a
keyboard and it was OK.

00:43:57.660 --> 00:44:00.950
And Alan calls them
back into the room

00:44:00.950 --> 00:44:04.590
after a few minutes
of going through that.

00:44:04.590 --> 00:44:08.160
And he just says,
well, maybe just

00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:11.680
try-- make these tiny, tiny
little adjustments to what

00:44:11.680 --> 00:44:14.122
people are playing, the
sound, et cetera, et cetera.

00:44:14.122 --> 00:44:15.580
They went back into
the room and it

00:44:15.580 --> 00:44:17.340
sounded like a Alan
Parsons record.

00:44:17.340 --> 00:44:19.380
Just like that.

00:44:19.380 --> 00:44:21.840
It's like, we had had a
time warp or something.

00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:23.570
I mean, it was
just extraordinary.

00:44:23.570 --> 00:44:24.880
But it was just Alan's taste.

00:44:24.880 --> 00:44:26.500
I mean, he likes what he likes.

00:44:26.500 --> 00:44:29.955
It's probably quite difficult
to define what you like.

00:44:29.955 --> 00:44:31.330
But he knows what
he likes and he

00:44:31.330 --> 00:44:34.070
knows how to get what he
likes on whatever equipment

00:44:34.070 --> 00:44:35.252
he's looking at.

00:44:35.252 --> 00:44:37.210
And I think, yeah, you
asked what you could do.

00:44:37.210 --> 00:44:40.780
And I think it's just learning
how to listen and develop

00:44:40.780 --> 00:44:42.430
your own taste.

00:44:42.430 --> 00:44:44.130
That's probably a good place.

00:44:44.130 --> 00:44:49.930
ALAN PARSONS: It's a funny
thing because I don't go out

00:44:49.930 --> 00:44:53.860
intentionally to make
records sound like me,

00:44:53.860 --> 00:44:56.160
but people tell me that my
records do sound like me.

00:44:56.160 --> 00:44:57.440
But I don't know why.

00:44:57.440 --> 00:45:00.194
I can't actually
pinpoint what it is.

00:45:00.194 --> 00:45:02.360
JULIAN COLBECK: Well, it's
just your taste isn't it?

00:45:02.360 --> 00:45:04.110
I mean, you like a certain
thing and therefore he

00:45:04.110 --> 00:45:05.651
gets the certain
sound that he likes.

00:45:05.651 --> 00:45:08.440
And I think we all do that
in our day-to-day lives.

00:45:10.645 --> 00:45:12.770
ALAN PARSONS: I know I was
talking about Abbey Road

00:45:12.770 --> 00:45:13.920
engineers.

00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:15.900
You could hear a record
and you could say, oh,

00:45:15.900 --> 00:45:18.275
that's one of Peter Vince's,
or that one's Peter Brown's.

00:45:18.275 --> 00:45:21.090
That's Geoff Emerick.

00:45:21.090 --> 00:45:23.390
Engineers did have a style.

00:45:23.390 --> 00:45:27.060
I think that's gone a
little bit in today's market

00:45:27.060 --> 00:45:30.020
because there's just
so much music out there

00:45:30.020 --> 00:45:37.020
and everybody's using the
same equipment, same plugins,

00:45:37.020 --> 00:45:42.800
same basic premises
to create what

00:45:42.800 --> 00:45:46.106
is considered to be
commercial in today's market.

00:45:46.106 --> 00:45:47.772
JULIAN COLBECK: But
isn't also that they

00:45:47.772 --> 00:45:49.230
are dependent on
the same equipment

00:45:49.230 --> 00:45:51.470
and dependent on the
same plugins as opposed

00:45:51.470 --> 00:45:54.719
to dependent on these things?

00:45:54.719 --> 00:45:55.510
ALAN PARSONS: Yeah.

00:45:55.510 --> 00:45:56.680
Ears are very important.

00:45:56.680 --> 00:45:59.922
I did discover that early on.

00:45:59.922 --> 00:46:01.380
AUDIENCE: Can you
talk a little bit

00:46:01.380 --> 00:46:05.380
about the process of mixing for
a surround sound experience?

00:46:05.380 --> 00:46:06.940
And in a somewhat
related question,

00:46:06.940 --> 00:46:08.510
have you ever done
a mix specifically

00:46:08.510 --> 00:46:09.510
for headphone listening?

00:46:13.250 --> 00:46:16.490
ALAN PARSONS: Surround, I mean,
I love mixing for surround.

00:46:16.490 --> 00:46:21.060
I've unfortunately not
done much of my own music,

00:46:21.060 --> 00:46:29.270
apart from two albums, which
we mixed on air in surround.

00:46:29.270 --> 00:46:35.010
But none of the Alan Parson's
Projects yet exist in surround.

00:46:35.010 --> 00:46:39.120
I did two of Al Stewart's
bigger hits, "Year

00:46:39.120 --> 00:46:43.600
of the Cat" and "Time
Passages," but for some reason

00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:45.961
they've never been released.

00:46:45.961 --> 00:46:47.960
You just reminded me that
I need to make a phone

00:46:47.960 --> 00:46:48.626
call about that.

00:46:51.090 --> 00:46:53.920
I love surround.

00:46:53.920 --> 00:46:56.040
The sad thing is
that so many people

00:46:56.040 --> 00:47:00.490
have home theaters with
surround systems for movies,

00:47:00.490 --> 00:47:04.260
but are almost
unaware that there's

00:47:04.260 --> 00:47:07.840
a wealth of music out
there that deserves

00:47:07.840 --> 00:47:08.840
to be heard in surround.

00:47:13.454 --> 00:47:15.620
You may be surprised to
hear that mixing surround is

00:47:15.620 --> 00:47:18.270
actually easier than
mixing in stereo

00:47:18.270 --> 00:47:21.390
because there's something
about music coming

00:47:21.390 --> 00:47:25.130
from all directions that makes
balance a little bit more

00:47:25.130 --> 00:47:26.664
forgiving.

00:47:26.664 --> 00:47:28.830
Subtleties of balance are
more forgiving in surround

00:47:28.830 --> 00:47:29.830
than they are in stereo.

00:47:35.790 --> 00:47:37.380
As you'll see in
the book, I've never

00:47:37.380 --> 00:47:40.410
been a supporter of
the center channel.

00:47:40.410 --> 00:47:43.754
And I very rarely put
anything of importance

00:47:43.754 --> 00:47:44.670
in the center channel.

00:47:44.670 --> 00:47:49.100
I much rather use
the phantom center.

00:47:49.100 --> 00:47:51.380
That most of my
surround material,

00:47:51.380 --> 00:47:53.380
if you listen to the
central channel on its own,

00:47:53.380 --> 00:47:56.170
it will be most of
the time just a mix

00:47:56.170 --> 00:47:59.990
of the left and
right front channels.

00:47:59.990 --> 00:48:02.480
But it's a big subject.

00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:06.540
And thank you for
at least raising it,

00:48:06.540 --> 00:48:11.150
but I wish labels would
put more money into it.

00:48:11.150 --> 00:48:14.760
I wish artists would
show more interest in it.

00:48:14.760 --> 00:48:20.050
And I wish consumers would just
go out and buy the stuff that's

00:48:20.050 --> 00:48:23.350
there because it really
is such good fun.

00:48:23.350 --> 00:48:25.570
I've always said that
listening in surround

00:48:25.570 --> 00:48:28.730
is like listening to
stereo after mono.

00:48:28.730 --> 00:48:30.140
It's the same leap.

00:48:30.140 --> 00:48:31.860
The same jump.

00:48:31.860 --> 00:48:34.750
AUDIENCE: What about mixes
specifically for headphones?

00:48:34.750 --> 00:48:35.970
ALAN PARSONS: Oh, right.

00:48:35.970 --> 00:48:36.470
Headphones.

00:48:40.730 --> 00:48:44.055
I'm always checking every
mix I do on headphones.

00:48:46.790 --> 00:48:51.614
I think far too many people are
listening to Lo-Fi headphones--

00:48:51.614 --> 00:48:53.280
little white things
stuck in their ears.

00:48:57.720 --> 00:49:02.020
But it's just there is a
difference in the hearing

00:49:02.020 --> 00:49:04.355
experience between
headphones and speakers.

00:49:07.080 --> 00:49:13.710
But I will always check to make
sure there are no surprises.

00:49:13.710 --> 00:49:21.020
I mean, headphones
tend accentuate reverb.

00:49:21.020 --> 00:49:27.360
I find sometimes that I might
back off reverb a little bit

00:49:27.360 --> 00:49:29.720
when listening on headphones.

00:49:29.720 --> 00:49:31.610
But you have to compromise.

00:49:31.610 --> 00:49:33.750
I can't do a mix
especially for headphones.

00:49:33.750 --> 00:49:35.121
Why would I do that?

00:49:35.121 --> 00:49:36.621
AUDIENCE: The
thunderstorm on "Tales

00:49:36.621 --> 00:49:38.348
of Mystery and
Imagination" was recorded

00:49:38.348 --> 00:49:39.806
by an aural microphone
[INAUDIBLE].

00:49:42.169 --> 00:49:42.960
ALAN PARSONS: Yeah.

00:49:42.960 --> 00:49:44.496
Yeah.

00:49:44.496 --> 00:49:46.794
That sounds good on
headphones doesn't it?

00:49:46.794 --> 00:49:49.210
AUDIENCE: Are there any plans
to release the Alan Parson's

00:49:49.210 --> 00:49:51.400
records in high def?

00:49:51.400 --> 00:49:54.060
Like maybe give them the
King Crimson treatments

00:49:54.060 --> 00:49:56.130
that Steve Wilson has done?

00:49:56.130 --> 00:49:59.400
ALAN PARSONS: I would
like to see that happen.

00:49:59.400 --> 00:50:02.550
I'm sort of in the
midst of a renegotiation

00:50:02.550 --> 00:50:05.150
with my label and my publisher.

00:50:05.150 --> 00:50:07.220
So as soon as we
get through that,

00:50:07.220 --> 00:50:13.590
I'm going to try and get some
high def downloads available.

00:50:13.590 --> 00:50:15.910
And if no one takes them
up, I'll take them myself.

00:50:15.910 --> 00:50:17.391
I'll license them myself.

00:50:17.391 --> 00:50:17.890
Good.

00:50:17.890 --> 00:50:18.990
OK.

00:50:18.990 --> 00:50:20.020
Sold one copy.

00:50:20.020 --> 00:50:21.122
All right.

00:50:21.122 --> 00:50:22.080
WESLEY CHAN: All right.

00:50:22.080 --> 00:50:23.560
We have just a minute left.

00:50:23.560 --> 00:50:26.110
Is there one final
question that people have?

00:50:26.110 --> 00:50:28.000
AUDIENCE: You have a
little chapter on MIDI,

00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:30.220
but I noticed you didn't
have like the little charts

00:50:30.220 --> 00:50:31.740
and bars.

00:50:31.740 --> 00:50:35.069
So how much are you into MIDI?

00:50:35.069 --> 00:50:37.110
Some people think of it
as an ancient technology,

00:50:37.110 --> 00:50:38.410
but I think it's like WAVs.

00:50:38.410 --> 00:50:42.010
It actually is pretty
smart and still being used.

00:50:42.010 --> 00:50:44.130
ALAN PARSONS: Julian
is the MIDI man.

00:50:44.130 --> 00:50:44.760
JULIAN COLBECK: I
think I actually

00:50:44.760 --> 00:50:46.210
did write the
first book on MIDI.

00:50:46.210 --> 00:50:47.730
But anyway.

00:50:47.730 --> 00:50:49.290
MIDI is like electricity.

00:50:49.290 --> 00:50:50.420
I mean, it's a tool.

00:50:50.420 --> 00:50:51.440
It's a means to an end.

00:50:51.440 --> 00:50:52.790
Is electricity good?

00:50:52.790 --> 00:50:55.440
Does it sound good?

00:50:55.440 --> 00:50:57.400
I mean, MIDI doesn't
sound good or bad.

00:50:57.400 --> 00:50:58.970
It isn't good or bad.

00:50:58.970 --> 00:51:00.120
It's a tool.

00:51:00.120 --> 00:51:03.500
In good hands, I mean, MIDI
is just unbelievably powerful

00:51:03.500 --> 00:51:05.440
and unbelievably creative.

00:51:05.440 --> 00:51:07.830
And it's still there
in kind of version 1.0.

00:51:07.830 --> 00:51:11.060
I mean there is threatening
things happening at the moment,

00:51:11.060 --> 00:51:13.881
but essentially it's still
there in its original format.

00:51:13.881 --> 00:51:16.380
ALAN PARSONS: We can't say that
for much software out there.

00:51:16.380 --> 00:51:17.588
JULIAN COLBECK: That's right.

00:51:17.588 --> 00:51:21.410
1983 to now and it
hasn't changed at all.

00:51:21.410 --> 00:51:24.350
That is unbelievable.

00:51:24.350 --> 00:51:26.970
It's kind of difficult
to get your head around,

00:51:26.970 --> 00:51:30.710
so I think MIDI's problem
is being that people either

00:51:30.710 --> 00:51:32.910
misinterpret it or don't
use it because they

00:51:32.910 --> 00:51:34.740
are kind of befuddled by it.

00:51:34.740 --> 00:51:36.934
AUDIENCE: Well, if
you have the ear,

00:51:36.934 --> 00:51:38.600
you could do a track
that is super solid

00:51:38.600 --> 00:51:40.630
and drag the snare a little bit.

00:51:40.630 --> 00:51:41.540
And stuff like that.

00:51:41.540 --> 00:51:42.440
JULIAN COLBECK: Yeah.

00:51:42.440 --> 00:51:43.790
AUDIENCE: Stuff that you
couldn't get that drummer

00:51:43.790 --> 00:51:44.332
to do.

00:51:44.332 --> 00:51:46.540
ALAN PARSONS: I don't see
that as being a MIDI thing,

00:51:46.540 --> 00:51:48.240
I see that as being a DAW thing.

00:51:48.240 --> 00:51:49.610
AUDIENCE: A production thing.

00:51:49.610 --> 00:51:50.401
ALAN PARSONS: Yeah.

00:51:50.401 --> 00:51:53.360
JULIAN COLBECK: Well, I
developed some software

00:51:53.360 --> 00:51:55.190
Twiddly.Bits which
are these little what

00:51:55.190 --> 00:51:56.145
we call MIDI samples.

00:51:59.230 --> 00:52:01.940
And these were MIDI recordings
of drummers and bass players

00:52:01.940 --> 00:52:06.080
and guitar players using MIDI
drums, MIDI bass, MIDI guitars.

00:52:06.080 --> 00:52:07.750
And one of the
things we did early,

00:52:07.750 --> 00:52:12.625
I was playing with Bill Bruford,
from King Crimson and YES,

00:52:12.625 --> 00:52:19.250
and we recorded him on a Simmons
kit-- a sophisticated STX kit.

00:52:19.250 --> 00:52:23.680
And Bill sounds like Bill on any
kit you care to name in MIDI.

00:52:23.680 --> 00:52:25.360
You can just feel his heartbeat.

00:52:25.360 --> 00:52:27.240
He's always slightly
ahead on the snare,

00:52:27.240 --> 00:52:28.830
slightly behind
on the kick drum.

00:52:28.830 --> 00:52:29.810
That's his DNA.

00:52:29.810 --> 00:52:32.640
So, I mean, MIDI I
think has the capability

00:52:32.640 --> 00:52:36.620
of displaying your DNA as
a player, as a performer.

00:52:36.620 --> 00:52:39.460
And that's really fascinating.

00:52:39.460 --> 00:52:42.330
ALAN PARSONS: And it
still forms the basis

00:52:42.330 --> 00:52:46.245
of so much more than just
keyboards and samples.

00:52:49.150 --> 00:52:51.315
Mixing automation is
based on MIDI largely.

00:52:54.140 --> 00:52:59.860
My console at home
it uses MIDI to talk

00:52:59.860 --> 00:53:03.790
to other components
in the system.

00:53:03.790 --> 00:53:09.460
So it's not all about
punching notes onto a screen

00:53:09.460 --> 00:53:11.830
or telling one keyboard
to play another keyboard.

00:53:11.830 --> 00:53:15.020
It goes way beyond that.

00:53:15.020 --> 00:53:17.620
AUDIENCE: And still well.

00:53:17.620 --> 00:53:19.982
ALAN PARSONS: And
still version 1.0.

00:53:19.982 --> 00:53:20.940
WESLEY CHAN: All right.

00:53:20.940 --> 00:53:21.240
Great.

00:53:21.240 --> 00:53:22.270
Thanks for the question.

00:53:22.270 --> 00:53:24.480
All right, everybody,
let's thank Alan and Julian

00:53:24.480 --> 00:53:25.380
for coming by today.

00:53:25.380 --> 00:53:29.330
[APPLAUSE]
