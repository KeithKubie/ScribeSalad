SUSAN WOLFSON: Here are five
really interesting facts

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:03.870
about "Frankenstein."

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.200
Because the first
publication was anonymous,

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.820
all the first reviewers
of "Frankenstein"

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:12.720
assumed that such a
blasphemous horror could have

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:14.850
been written only by a man.

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:20.430
Victor Frankenstein animates his
creature by a mysterious spark.

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.980
There is not the lightning
of modern cinematic

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.180
interpretation.

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.820
Victor Frankenstein discovers
the secret of life in 1791,

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.640
the year that Mary
Shelley's parents met.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.070
As he creates his
creature, it takes

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.970
him nine months, a Gothic parody
of normal human gestation.

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:43.110
Though popular culture
refers to Dr. Frankenstein,

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.840
Victor Frankenstein
is no doctor.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.930
He's a brilliant
undergraduate science student.

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.440
"Frankenstein" was first
published in a short run

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.720
of only 500 copies.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.510
And Princeton Rare Books
and Special Collections

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.270
owns one of these copies.
