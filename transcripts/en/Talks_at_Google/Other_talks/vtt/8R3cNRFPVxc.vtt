FEMALE SPEAKER: Hello, everyone.

00:00:04.435 --> 00:00:05.976
Welcome, fellow
Googlers, and guests.

00:00:05.976 --> 00:00:08.840
I'm very excited
today to introduce

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:12.350
an incredibly inspiring
person, author, and speaker,

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:15.260
Joe Plumeri, who is
here today to share

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.242
a bit about his new book, "The
Power of Being Yourself-- A

00:00:18.242 --> 00:00:20.920
Game Plan for Success
by Putting Passion

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.050
into Your Work and Life."

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:27.050
Joe Plumeri is the former CEO
of Willis Group, and Citibank

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:28.060
North America.

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.470
He now serves as the Vice
Chairman of First Data

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.522
Corporation, and a member
of its board of directors.

00:00:34.522 --> 00:00:37.330
His passion, honesty,
and sense of purpose

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:40.930
flows through the pages of his
book, as well as his speeches.

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:44.438
So please join me in
welcoming Joe Plumeri.

00:00:44.438 --> 00:00:46.756
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:46.756 --> 00:00:47.714
JOE PLUMERI: Thank you.

00:00:47.714 --> 00:00:49.120
Thank you very much.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:50.670
Thank you all for coming.

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.170
I appreciate it very much.

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.650
First of all, I should tell
you why I wrote this book.

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:58.100
I am not a writer.

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.540
I don't do that for a living.

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:05.710
But I have passion, and I have
a point of view about things.

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:07.330
And a couple years
ago, I started

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.170
to think about-- as you all
do-- about life in general,

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:12.780
and how things are going.

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.190
And I said to myself, you
know, it's interesting

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:21.390
how we all celebrate
authenticity in this country.

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:22.920
We think authenticity is great.

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.570
We see people who
are genuine, and we

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.980
say that person is
really a real person.

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.350
And then we see
everything's filtered today

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.480
through emails, texts,
Instagrams, Twitters,

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:39.930
LinkedIns, and by the time you
get through all of that stuff,

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.210
you wonder what's
true, and what's false.

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.200
I see in companies,
people send emails

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.400
because they don't want to
be there when people are

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.720
reading it on the other end.

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:54.480
And I think about how unfamiliar
we've become with each other.

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:58.280
I watch television, and
I see people read off

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:59.210
of teleprompters.

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.170
And I ask myself, did
they really write that?

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.940
Do they really feel that
way about the subject,

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.510
or does somebody
else feel that way?

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:13.000
I see people on television get
choked up, and begin to cry.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.330
And they apologize
immediately for crying.

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.150
And I ask myself, why
are they apologizing

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.600
for being themselves, and being
genuine about who they are?

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.910
And I think about our
society, and are we

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.830
being disconnected with how
we really feel about things?

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.800
And so I wanted to
write this book.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.540
I had in my head to do it
for all of those reasons.

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:43.190
And then a couple years ago,
my son-- my now-oldest son

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.180
was running in the
Boston Marathon.

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:52.210
And it was the day of the
terrorist attack in Boston.

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:53.770
And you'll read
about it in the book.

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:56.460
And it's really
what motivated me

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:00.560
to write the book, when I saw
people's emotions that day.

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.910
I saw them caring
for each other.

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.470
I saw people helping each other.

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.500
I saw people terrorized.

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.490
And I said, why do we have
to wait for an occasion?

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:13.570
Why do we have to wait
for a wedding, a funeral,

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:17.730
or a catastrophe for people
to really show who they are?

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.530
Why can't we be
that way every day?

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:25.420
So what I did was to set
about stories in the book

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.260
about being yourself,
either my stories,

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:30.350
or other people's stories.

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:33.740
And I didn't do it by
virtue of chapters.

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:36.200
I did it by virtue
of principles, things

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:37.640
that I believed in.

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:39.370
So that when you
read the book, it's

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.470
not something you put
back on the shelf and say,

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:42.980
OK, I read that book.

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:45.630
But it's something that
you could use every day.

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.580
And something that you could
remind yourself all about.

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:53.420
And I tried to be-- and I
know I was-- as transparent

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.400
as you possibly could be.

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.180
Because otherwise, the book
would not have integrity.

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:03.190
I'm just going to talk to you
about a few of the principles.

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:06.230
One of the principles is, we
all got the same plumbing.

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:09.320
Now you're asking me,
what is that all about?

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:11.220
What that's about
is, is I've traveled

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.300
throughout the whole world.

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:18.630
And what I found out was, is
that whether you're from Asia,

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:20.189
or whether you're
from Indianapolis,

00:04:20.189 --> 00:04:21.730
or whether you're
from South America,

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:24.120
or wherever you're
from, everybody

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:28.250
feels the same feeling
that we all do.

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:30.110
And that if we
understood that better,

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:34.050
maybe the world would be a
little bit nicer, and more

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.940
peaceful.

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:36.630
Because I have
traveled the world.

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:42.680
I was the CEO of a British
company for 13 years.

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.880
And you would think
when everybody

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:49.040
talks about the British
and being stiff, and stiff

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:50.990
upper lip, and they
don't laugh a lot,

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:53.220
they don't do all
that kind of stuff.

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:56.460
I found the direct
opposite of all of that.

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:00.430
But you hear that, and you begin
to think that people really

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:02.760
don't understand what
other people are all about.

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:05.385
When I got to this company-- it
was called the Willis Group--

00:05:05.385 --> 00:05:07.118
it didn't make very much money.

00:05:07.118 --> 00:05:08.326
Didn't make any money at all.

00:05:08.326 --> 00:05:10.880
So I had to do something
to get everybody

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:12.880
engaged in the company.

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:15.190
And so what I did was--
and I didn't know this--

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:18.280
but I created these
little pins that everybody

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:20.076
could wear with Willis on it.

00:05:20.076 --> 00:05:21.826
And I thought that if
everybody wore a pin

00:05:21.826 --> 00:05:24.562
they'd become sort of
like part of the company.

00:05:24.562 --> 00:05:26.270
And everybody would
start to feel a sense

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:28.400
of being a part of things.

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:31.820
And I didn't know the British
don't like wearing pins.

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:33.230
Nobody told me that.

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:36.910
As a matter of fact, they're
really disgusted with the pin.

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:40.490
But they knew that
when I showed up,

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:42.344
if they didn't wear
the pin, that I

00:05:42.344 --> 00:05:43.510
would give them a hard time.

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:44.430
Which I never did.

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:48.500
I just stared at their lapels
to see if they had a pin on.

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:51.780
So when people would
walk down the hall,

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:54.230
I always knew that they
didn't have a pin on,

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:56.460
because a woman would
go in the men's room,

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:58.460
and a man would go
in the women's room

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:00.190
so they wouldn't confront me.

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:03.460
And so one day-- and I knew that
this happened in the company--

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:06.130
they felt that when
they confronted me

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:08.060
they'd have to know
what was going on.

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:10.530
They'd have to have a reason
to not have their pin on.

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:13.230
So I get the one guy,
and I look at his lapel,

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:15.680
I don't say anything to him.

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:18.420
And he says, "Oh,
Mr. Chairman, I'm

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:20.130
sorry I don't have my pin on.

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:23.850
I left it on my pajamas."

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:25.970
When you think
about that, and you

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:28.120
think about that
kind of humor, you

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:30.230
wouldn't think that
would come from what

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:33.780
your perception is of a Brit.

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:40.570
We dedicated a building in
London a few years later.

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:42.600
Made the company successful.

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:44.760
Became a global company.

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:46.440
And I built a building
in London right

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:49.300
across from Lloyd's of London.

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:52.710
So I have to dedicate the
building, and they say to me,

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:55.290
"Who are you going to have
to dedicate the building?"

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:56.010
I said, "Me.

00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:57.610
I'm going to dedicate."

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:00.160
But apparently in London,
you don't dedicate buildings

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:03.230
unless you have royalty
in these buildings.

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:06.420
So a friend of mine says,
I can get you some royalty.

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:07.890
I said, who could you get?

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:11.480
He picks up the phone, and
he talks to Prince Andrew.

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:13.830
Now, I come from a neighborhood
in Trenton, New Jersey.

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:15.470
I don't know royalty from Adam.

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:20.020
But he gets the prince to
show up for the dedication.

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:23.470
Now in advance of
the dedication,

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:26.560
I get a long list of
things that you're not

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:31.000
supposed to do when
you're around royalty.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.100
One of them is, you
don't touch royalty.

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:39.070
You just put your hands,
and you don't touch them.

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:42.634
So I said, this makes me
nervous, because I'm a toucher.

00:07:42.634 --> 00:07:45.050
Like I did with all of you, I
said hello when you came in.

00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:46.780
It's just the way I am.

00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:49.540
So I meet him
outside the building.

00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:51.870
And interestingly
enough, he drives up

00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:53.400
with his own Range Rover.

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:54.900
There's no entourage.

00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:56.240
He just drives up by himself.

00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:57.198
He gets out of the car.

00:07:57.198 --> 00:07:58.776
So I feel more
comfortable with him.

00:07:58.776 --> 00:08:00.400
And it's going to be
like three or four

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:04.110
hours before the two of
us dedicate the building.

00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:06.710
So I take him
around and so forth.

00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:09.580
And I said to him,
I gotta tell you.

00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:11.040
I'm a little bit nervous.

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:12.612
He said, what are
you nervous about?

00:08:12.612 --> 00:08:14.070
I said, I'm nervous
because there's

00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:16.386
this long list that says I'm
not supposed to touch you.

00:08:16.386 --> 00:08:17.760
So I want you to
know in advance,

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:21.640
before I'm arrested,
that I might touch you.

00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:24.650
I'm sorry, I don't mean it.

00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:27.090
So we dedicate the building.

00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:29.760
And during the ceremony,
I give a speech.

00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:32.130
And during the
speech, I read a note

00:08:32.130 --> 00:08:35.559
from my mother, who
was alive at the time.

00:08:35.559 --> 00:08:38.820
And the note said
something to the effect,

00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:42.809
thank you to Prince Andrew
for being nice to my son

00:08:42.809 --> 00:08:45.530
Joey-- my mother's from Italy.

00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:48.060
And she appreciates
it very much.

00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:50.530
And he's very honored,
and he's very nervous.

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:52.380
So please take care of him.

00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:54.190
Something along those lines.

00:08:54.190 --> 00:08:56.490
So I read the note,
everybody applauds.

00:08:56.490 --> 00:08:58.670
I get a standing ovation.

00:08:58.670 --> 00:09:01.240
And as I turn around,
the prince is there,

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:03.520
and he gives me a hug.

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:07.670
And everybody's astounded that
the prince is giving me a hug.

00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:11.190
And I said to myself,
again, isn't it interesting

00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:14.090
when you have a perception
that people don't

00:09:14.090 --> 00:09:17.329
do those kinds of things,
that really we're more alike

00:09:17.329 --> 00:09:18.120
than anything else.

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:21.270
I've never gone around
the world, any place--

00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:24.450
because I'm pretty enthusiastic,
as you see-- where I've

00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:26.790
said to somebody,
nice job, good job,

00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:28.470
and they've said to
me, stop telling me

00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:30.270
I've done a nice job.

00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:31.620
I'm tired of hearing that.

00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:34.560
Or they said to me,
you're too enthusiastic.

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:36.070
Don't be so enthusiastic.

00:09:36.070 --> 00:09:37.820
We all got the same plumbing.

00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:40.020
I've never heard anybody,
any place in the world,

00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:41.520
tell me otherwise.

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:45.390
So if you understand that as
you're dealing with the world--

00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:47.640
the message in that
principle is that you're

00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:49.200
dealing with the world.

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:50.310
We may look different.

00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:51.790
We may talk different.

00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:54.750
But at the end of the day,
we've all got the same plumbing.

00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:57.250
We all got the same insides.

00:09:57.250 --> 00:09:59.990
We all got the same heart.

00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:01.600
And it's really
important that we

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:04.800
begin to get in
touch with our heart,

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:09.480
even here, where it's the
center of information.

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:14.360
Here at Google, there's
one thing you can't do.

00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:16.710
I google all day long.

00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:20.010
I got a piece of information I
want, I take my cell phone out,

00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:21.450
and I google it.

00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:24.250
But one thing that you can't
do, and you ought to try it,

00:10:24.250 --> 00:10:27.150
is try googling your heart.

00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:30.070
Or try googling my heart.

00:10:30.070 --> 00:10:32.640
And you'll get the
lyrics of a song.

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:34.760
You'll get the way
the heart is shaped.

00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:37.340
And what I'm talking
about is your feelings,

00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:39.420
and how you express
yourself, and how

00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:41.250
you relate to each other.

00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:42.740
Which is really,
I think, important

00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:46.260
in a society today
that is lacking that.

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:48.460
And is lacking the risk-taking,
and everything else

00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:49.320
that you need to do.

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:51.380
So that is the first principle.

00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:53.250
And it's really
interesting stories.

00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:56.360
And there are other stories
about people who have

00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:59.000
the same plumbing in the book.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.940
Another principle I talk about,
which is really interesting,

00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:06.210
is make your heart
your teleprompter.

00:11:06.210 --> 00:11:09.150
Now you'll ask me,
what's that about?

00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:12.150
I go to speak at the
Georgia Dome one year.

00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:14.430
And usually when
you go speak, they

00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:19.440
want you to test the
microphone, or to test whatever.

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:23.280
And the guy said, let's
work on the teleprompter.

00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:26.799
And I said, I don't
use the teleprompter.

00:11:26.799 --> 00:11:28.090
He said, well, what do you use?

00:11:28.090 --> 00:11:30.720
I said, I brought
my own teleprompter.

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:33.080
He said, nobody brings
their own teleprompter.

00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:34.679
What are you talking about?

00:11:34.679 --> 00:11:35.720
I said, I brought my own.

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:37.090
He said, where is it?

00:11:37.090 --> 00:11:39.900
I said, my teleprompter
is right here.

00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:40.660
It's my heart.

00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:41.920
I speak from my heart.

00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:44.920
I don't read from a speech.

00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:46.000
I don't read from notes.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.960
I speak from my heart.

00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:50.540
And what I mean by
that in that principle

00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:54.270
is that today nobody
takes any risks.

00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:56.320
Nobody goes out
and does anything

00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:58.600
unless a poll was taken.

00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:01.570
Nobody does anything
unless a survey is taken.

00:12:01.570 --> 00:12:05.010
Nobody does anything
unless there's a consensus.

00:12:05.010 --> 00:12:07.880
And then it's OK,
and it's safe to do.

00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:10.750
Instead of going out
and actually doing

00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:13.470
what's in your heart
that you think is right.

00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:18.050
And I tell a couple of stories
in the book about that.

00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:21.880
One of the stories
I tell is in 2000,

00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:25.165
when I became chairman
and CEO of Willis.

00:12:25.165 --> 00:12:27.570
The first thing you do when
you become a CEO is you

00:12:27.570 --> 00:12:29.770
look at all the things that
happened in the company.

00:12:29.770 --> 00:12:31.186
And the company
wasn't doing well.

00:12:31.186 --> 00:12:34.440
So I wanted to see
everything that was going on.

00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:37.030
So I looked at the
benefits policy.

00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:40.470
And the benefits
policy did not include

00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:43.400
benefits for domestic partners.

00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:46.100
And I thought, that's not right.

00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:49.740
I think benefits should be
given to domestic partners.

00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:52.070
I think everybody should
be treated equally.

00:12:52.070 --> 00:12:56.220
Now if you go back to 2000,
that wasn't fashionable.

00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:57.630
Nobody made me do it.

00:12:57.630 --> 00:13:00.570
There was no polls
and surveys, or rants

00:13:00.570 --> 00:13:05.700
and raves about everybody being
given equal rights domestically

00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:07.410
in benefits in companies.

00:13:07.410 --> 00:13:10.200
I just thought it was
the right thing to do.

00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:13.490
So I changed it without
anybody asking me to do it.

00:13:13.490 --> 00:13:18.260
Because in my heart, I thought
it was the right thing to do.

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:21.680
In the company is a guy
by name of Bryan Eure,

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:24.990
who is a broker at Willis.

00:13:24.990 --> 00:13:29.740
And eventually he gets
married to Bill White,

00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:32.960
and they have a big wedding
at the Four Seasons restaurant

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:33.790
in New York City.

00:13:33.790 --> 00:13:41.579
I had no idea why this guy was
at Willis until that night.

00:13:41.579 --> 00:13:43.620
And he gets up to give
the speech at his wedding.

00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:45.860
There's 700 people there.

00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:48.340
And he gets up to give
his speech, and he says,

00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:50.920
I want to thank Joe
Plumeri, because without Joe

00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:55.230
Plumeri being at Willis, I
would never be here tonight,

00:13:55.230 --> 00:13:56.880
or marrying Bill White.

00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:59.210
It was right after New
York changed the law

00:13:59.210 --> 00:14:01.770
to be able to be married.

00:14:01.770 --> 00:14:04.230
And he went on to say,
when he was looking

00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:08.520
for a job in New York City, he
found that the only insurance

00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:11.815
broker in New York
that he could find

00:14:11.815 --> 00:14:16.970
that gave benefits to domestic
partners was the Willis Group.

00:14:16.970 --> 00:14:21.660
And I want to thank Joe Plumeri
for changing that benefit.

00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:23.340
Or I wouldn't be here tonight.

00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:28.490
Up until that night, I had no
idea why the guy was at Willis.

00:14:28.490 --> 00:14:31.640
And he announced that
in front of 700 people.

00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:34.350
That just moved me so much.

00:14:34.350 --> 00:14:37.090
Because I said to myself, if
I hadn't done what I thought

00:14:37.090 --> 00:14:39.460
was right, he wouldn't be here.

00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:42.220
He wouldn't be getting married,
wouldn't be in New York City.

00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:45.380
And I wonder how many
people are holding back

00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:47.960
from doing what is right
and in their heart,

00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:52.120
and being themselves, rather
than waiting for a survey,

00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:56.240
or conventional wisdom
to tell them what to do.

00:14:56.240 --> 00:15:00.120
You'll see in the book,
there's a forward from a man

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:06.330
by the name of Joe Califano, who
none of you have ever heard of.

00:15:06.330 --> 00:15:12.180
But you notice these days that
not many people smoke much

00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:13.090
anymore.

00:15:13.090 --> 00:15:15.620
If I ever told you
that people wouldn't

00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:18.600
smoke in pubs in Ireland,
or places like that,

00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:19.890
you'd be amazed.

00:15:19.890 --> 00:15:21.120
Because that's what they do.

00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:22.970
They were born doing that.

00:15:22.970 --> 00:15:26.440
Well, who's Joe Califano?

00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:31.780
He was the domestic adviser
for Lyndon Johnson in the '60s.

00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:35.090
And you might have read about
the Great Society, which

00:15:35.090 --> 00:15:36.939
is where Medicare and
Medicaid come from.

00:15:36.939 --> 00:15:39.230
So if you want to know where
Medicaid and Medicare came

00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:41.180
from, it was the
Great Society that

00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:45.110
was written by Joe Califano
under Lyndon Johnson.

00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:49.540
He was the Secretary of
Health, Education, and Welfare

00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:53.020
under Jimmy Carter.

00:15:53.020 --> 00:15:57.020
In 1978, he declared
that smoking

00:15:57.020 --> 00:16:02.080
be prohibited in federal
buildings, and in airplanes.

00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:05.810
And there were such
an outcry that he

00:16:05.810 --> 00:16:09.670
was fired by Jimmy
Carter, because

00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:14.695
of banning smoking in
1978 in federal buildings,

00:16:14.695 --> 00:16:16.870
and airplanes.

00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:21.090
And after he was fired,
he dedicated himself.

00:16:21.090 --> 00:16:24.580
Because the headline said
that Joe Califano called

00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:29.640
smoking slow-motion suicide.

00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:35.250
So if you're wondering where
the nonsmoking thing started.

00:16:35.250 --> 00:16:37.360
When if you see
television series

00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:41.040
that go back to the '50s and
'60s, and everybody smokes.

00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:43.790
If you're asking yourself,
where did it start?

00:16:43.790 --> 00:16:47.710
Who started this whole thing
with no smoking in buildings,

00:16:47.710 --> 00:16:50.620
and here, and you can't do
that, and you can't do this.

00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:53.330
It was Joe Califano.

00:16:53.330 --> 00:16:56.580
All because in his
heart, even though he

00:16:56.580 --> 00:16:59.180
knew he would be
fired, he thought

00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:00.910
it was the right thing to do.

00:17:00.910 --> 00:17:05.140
How many people today, knowing
that they're going to be fired,

00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:06.139
do that?

00:17:06.139 --> 00:17:07.960
People don't do that today.

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:10.520
They do what's
politically correct today.

00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:13.283
They know that I got to do
what my boss tells me to do,

00:17:13.283 --> 00:17:15.074
even though it's not
the right thing to do,

00:17:15.074 --> 00:17:17.470
or what society tells me to do.

00:17:17.470 --> 00:17:19.880
But that's where the whole
nonsmoking thing started.

00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:22.839
So to me, he didn't
need a teleprompter

00:17:22.839 --> 00:17:24.589
to tell him what to say.

00:17:24.589 --> 00:17:27.220
His heart told him
what to say, even

00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:29.300
though he knew he
would be fired.

00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:32.250
And the forward of this
book is written by him.

00:17:32.250 --> 00:17:35.040
And I am proud that
that's the case.

00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:39.080
There's another
principle in the book

00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:41.750
called, let sadness teach you.

00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:46.500
Which is one that I share
and want to share with you.

00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:48.890
It's about my
relationship with my son

00:17:48.890 --> 00:17:55.640
Chris, who passed away six years
ago because of drug addiction.

00:17:55.640 --> 00:18:01.290
At 13 years old,
he was anorexic,

00:18:01.290 --> 00:18:05.360
as it turned out because
of a self-esteem problem.

00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:09.240
My relationship with
him from the period

00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:15.110
of 13 years old until when
he died at the age of 40,

00:18:15.110 --> 00:18:18.670
was obviously
contentious, and one

00:18:18.670 --> 00:18:23.500
where I tried very hard
to rebuild my relationship

00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:28.100
with him that hadn't been built
before he was 13 years old.

00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:33.180
And I tell as transparently,
and as truthfully,

00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:37.650
and in a raw way, what
my relationship with him

00:18:37.650 --> 00:18:38.240
was all about.

00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:43.780
I did all of the conventional
things that you should do.

00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:47.310
Send him to hospitals,
send him to therapists,

00:18:47.310 --> 00:18:50.630
send him to every place
that you can send people

00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:53.120
to go to be rehabilitated.

00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:58.040
But we never regained the
kind of a relationship

00:18:58.040 --> 00:18:59.840
that we should have.

00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:04.050
Because I think as I was
starting my meteoric rise,

00:19:04.050 --> 00:19:07.660
if you will, to the top
of the corporate world,

00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:11.530
I wasn't the parent
that I should have been.

00:19:11.530 --> 00:19:15.990
The reality was, is that
I neglected my own son,

00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:18.630
even though I did the
cosmetic things that you're

00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:21.810
supposed to do to get him help.

00:19:21.810 --> 00:19:25.440
Maybe, I say to myself, I should
have taken a year off of work

00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:28.750
rather than worry about
the next board meeting.

00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:31.680
And I tell that story.

00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:34.820
Interestingly
enough, I remember,

00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:37.570
the company I was running was
owned by American Express.

00:19:37.570 --> 00:19:40.090
And he was arrested
for credit card fraud

00:19:40.090 --> 00:19:43.680
and went to jail for 18 months.

00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:46.740
And I went to visit
him every weekend.

00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:50.400
But I could never seem
to repair the damage that

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:54.440
had been done because of the
neglect that had happened.

00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:56.920
I tell that story.

00:19:56.920 --> 00:20:00.940
And I tell that story
not only to parents,

00:20:00.940 --> 00:20:05.320
and I tell that story not
only to children of parents--

00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:07.020
it goes both ways.

00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:09.680
Is that I think one of the
most important things in life

00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:12.740
are the relationships
that you have.

00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:15.490
Don't neglect them.

00:20:15.490 --> 00:20:20.090
If you're a parent, the most
important thing you have to do

00:20:20.090 --> 00:20:24.550
is to make sure that you're
close to your children.

00:20:24.550 --> 00:20:27.800
When you see them, hug them,
tell them that you love them.

00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:30.630
If you're a child, and
you're listening to me now,

00:20:30.630 --> 00:20:33.910
and you're talking to
your parent, hug them,

00:20:33.910 --> 00:20:35.500
tell them that you love them.

00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:39.520
Because at the end of the day,
the last thing you want to do

00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:42.790
is feel the regret of not
having that relationship.

00:20:42.790 --> 00:20:44.770
I talk about the
pain of discipline,

00:20:44.770 --> 00:20:46.760
and the pain of regret.

00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:48.500
When you think about
life, it really

00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:51.480
gets down to those two
things, doesn't it?

00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:54.020
You either have the
pain of discipline,

00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:56.200
which is the short-term
pain that you have

00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:57.890
because you've got
to do something.

00:20:57.890 --> 00:21:00.730
But when you think about it,
it doesn't last very long.

00:21:00.730 --> 00:21:02.500
It's just short-term pain.

00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:05.920
But the pain of regret, when
you've ever felt regret,

00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:10.410
lasts longer, and it
just never goes away.

00:21:10.410 --> 00:21:12.520
And it's those kinds
of things in life

00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:14.150
that I think are important.

00:21:14.150 --> 00:21:16.300
And I think about my son.

00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:20.170
And I think about the regret
that I had with regard to that.

00:21:20.170 --> 00:21:22.030
And it's something
that never goes away.

00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:25.340
And I think about it over,
and over, and over again.

00:21:25.340 --> 00:21:28.490
And the same thing relates
to friendships that you have.

00:21:28.490 --> 00:21:29.990
If there's somebody
that you haven't

00:21:29.990 --> 00:21:31.740
talked to in a long time.

00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:33.751
Or somebody that
you're meaning to call.

00:21:33.751 --> 00:21:35.500
Where you're running
something, yeah, I've

00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:37.270
been meaning to call you.

00:21:37.270 --> 00:21:39.270
I got to tell you, do it.

00:21:39.270 --> 00:21:41.660
Before it's too late
to do it, and you

00:21:41.660 --> 00:21:43.490
regret not having done it.

00:21:43.490 --> 00:21:47.770
By the way, that same reason,
this whole idea of neglect

00:21:47.770 --> 00:21:52.770
not only applies to children,
and parents, friends,

00:21:52.770 --> 00:21:55.000
but also applies to clients.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:58.420
For people that are listening
to me with regard to business,

00:21:58.420 --> 00:22:01.810
the number one reason you
lose a client is neglect.

00:22:01.810 --> 00:22:04.980
You could make all the mistakes
in the world that you want,

00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:07.760
but the one mistake you
can't make is neglect them.

00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:10.640
Because they'll go someplace
else where they feel

00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:11.250
there's love.

00:22:11.250 --> 00:22:15.250
It's a wonderful
principle for you to read.

00:22:15.250 --> 00:22:17.420
And when I say, let
sadness teach you,

00:22:17.420 --> 00:22:21.140
I tell it so other people don't
go through the same thing I do.

00:22:21.140 --> 00:22:25.370
And the last principle I'll
talk to you about is called,

00:22:25.370 --> 00:22:28.830
look up, not down.

00:22:28.830 --> 00:22:31.740
We're all going to
have adversity in life.

00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:33.550
I was running Willis in 2008.

00:22:33.550 --> 00:22:37.400
For those of you who remember,
the world fell apart in 2008.

00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:38.980
We had the Great Recession.

00:22:38.980 --> 00:22:40.050
The banks were closed.

00:22:40.050 --> 00:22:40.820
No credit.

00:22:40.820 --> 00:22:42.410
Couldn't buy anything.

00:22:42.410 --> 00:22:47.280
Terrible time to
be around, frankly.

00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:50.350
So in 2008, I made the
decision to buy a company

00:22:50.350 --> 00:22:54.910
for $2 billion, which
is a lot of money

00:22:54.910 --> 00:22:57.440
not only in 2008
but at any time.

00:22:57.440 --> 00:23:02.020
It's supposed to close
in October of that year.

00:23:02.020 --> 00:23:05.210
The problem is, between June and
October, the world fell apart.

00:23:05.210 --> 00:23:08.000
So all the financing that
I was supposed to get,

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.750
I got, but only for a
short period of time.

00:23:10.750 --> 00:23:14.630
Instead of it being permanent,
it was temporary financing.

00:23:14.630 --> 00:23:17.080
That's in October,
and the deal closes.

00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:20.250
In November, my son passes away.

00:23:20.250 --> 00:23:22.680
So between October
and November, I

00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:24.760
don't know what worse
could happen to me.

00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:26.850
It's the time when I
could-- two choices.

00:23:26.850 --> 00:23:30.810
I could go dig a
hole and jump in it.

00:23:30.810 --> 00:23:34.560
Or I could get up in the morning
and go attack my problems,

00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:35.900
which I think you should do.

00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:37.400
You should always
attack your fears,

00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:39.690
because your fears
are your limitations.

00:23:39.690 --> 00:23:41.960
If you don't
overcome your fears,

00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:44.170
you're going to be limited
by them all your life.

00:23:44.170 --> 00:23:45.570
And so I had to go attack them.

00:23:45.570 --> 00:23:47.730
I talk about that.

00:23:47.730 --> 00:23:52.320
It turns out that after
I made this acquisition,

00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:54.850
this other company,
Hilb Rogal &amp; Hobbs,

00:23:54.850 --> 00:23:58.750
had five offices in Chicago.

00:23:58.750 --> 00:24:02.576
And what I needed to do was to
merge the five offices they had

00:24:02.576 --> 00:24:05.620
and the two offices
that I have so that they

00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:06.670
could be more efficient.

00:24:06.670 --> 00:24:08.180
We can grow one
culture rather than

00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:09.960
have all these offices
spend more money,

00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:12.080
and not have the same culture.

00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:14.180
So I looked to see
in Chicago where

00:24:14.180 --> 00:24:17.340
there was a lot of
buildings with that room,

00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:18.160
with that space.

00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:20.690
And the one place where
they had a lot of space

00:24:20.690 --> 00:24:23.560
was the famous Sears
Tower in Chicago.

00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:26.190
You all heard of the
Sears Tower in Chicago?

00:24:26.190 --> 00:24:29.130
Which is no longer called
the Sears Tower in Chicago,

00:24:29.130 --> 00:24:31.470
and I'll tell you that story.

00:24:31.470 --> 00:24:35.190
Tallest building in
the Western Hemisphere.

00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:36.880
Nothing like it.

00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:41.250
The problem was, is that it
was less than 70% occupied.

00:24:41.250 --> 00:24:46.340
And the reason was is when
the tenants' leases came up,

00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:50.230
they were all afraid that the
next terrorist attack was going

00:24:50.230 --> 00:24:53.487
to be the Sears Tower, because
it was the largest building

00:24:53.487 --> 00:24:54.570
in the Western Hemisphere.

00:24:54.570 --> 00:24:56.900
So as soon as the lease came
up, they got out of there.

00:24:56.900 --> 00:24:59.050
So there was a lot
of empty space.

00:24:59.050 --> 00:25:02.050
So I thought I had
a great opportunity

00:25:02.050 --> 00:25:05.740
to negotiate with the
owner a good deal.

00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:07.730
Because he had a
lot of empty space.

00:25:07.730 --> 00:25:09.490
The banks were
not lending money.

00:25:09.490 --> 00:25:10.860
The credit markets were closed.

00:25:10.860 --> 00:25:15.520
What a great opportunity,
that I could turn adversity

00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:18.420
into something that's really
terrific and positive.

00:25:18.420 --> 00:25:20.680
So I meet with the
owner, and I say to him,

00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:24.580
I need 250,000 square feet--
which is, by the way, about 3%

00:25:24.580 --> 00:25:26.690
of the building.

00:25:26.690 --> 00:25:28.300
And he says, I have
a lot of space.

00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:29.600
I could do a good deal for you.

00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:31.030
I knew I could.

00:25:31.030 --> 00:25:34.471
And he says to me, so what
would you like to pay?

00:25:34.471 --> 00:25:36.720
I said, well, what's the
average rent in the building?

00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:38.720
He says, $35 a square foot.

00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:42.575
So I said, I don't want
to tell you what I pay.

00:25:42.575 --> 00:25:43.700
I don't want to insult you.

00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:45.681
He said, tell me what you want.

00:25:45.681 --> 00:25:46.180
It's OK.

00:25:46.180 --> 00:25:46.760
Tell me.

00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:48.592
I said, no I don't
want to insult you.

00:25:48.592 --> 00:25:50.050
He said, no, tell
me what you want.

00:25:50.050 --> 00:25:50.830
I said, $10.

00:25:50.830 --> 00:25:53.550
He says, you insult me.

00:25:53.550 --> 00:25:55.690
So I got up to go away.

00:25:55.690 --> 00:25:58.260
And he said, no, he
says, let's do something.

00:25:58.260 --> 00:26:01.650
I'm making a long story that's
a wonderful story in the book.

00:26:01.650 --> 00:26:05.000
We arrive at $14.50
a square foot.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:08.060
Now for anybody who's in
the real estate business,

00:26:08.060 --> 00:26:13.800
or even renting, you know that
$14.50 a square foot is like

00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:14.605
nothing.

00:26:14.605 --> 00:26:16.730
I mean, I don't know what
it is a square foot here.

00:26:16.730 --> 00:26:20.220
This is like hallowed
ground, where I am now.

00:26:20.220 --> 00:26:23.330
I mean, you're talking-- I'm
serious-- 100s of dollars

00:26:23.330 --> 00:26:24.200
a square foot.

00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:27.860
This is $14.50 a square foot
in the middle of Chicago,

00:26:27.860 --> 00:26:30.340
the largest building in
the Western Hemisphere,

00:26:30.340 --> 00:26:32.170
$14.50 a square foot.

00:26:32.170 --> 00:26:35.090
He says to me, do
we have a deal now?

00:26:35.090 --> 00:26:37.370
I said, not exactly.

00:26:37.370 --> 00:26:39.367
He says, what do you want now?

00:26:39.367 --> 00:26:41.700
I said, you know what the
problem with this building is?

00:26:41.700 --> 00:26:43.120
It's a jinx.

00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:46.660
I says, it's a jinx,
because the Sears name

00:26:46.660 --> 00:26:49.080
connotes that a
terrorist attack is going

00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:51.250
to-- you need a positive name.

00:26:51.250 --> 00:26:53.450
He says, what name
should I put up there?

00:26:53.450 --> 00:26:55.400
I said, Willis.

00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:56.700
Nobody knew who Willis was.

00:26:56.700 --> 00:26:59.085
They thought it was that
little kid on television.

00:26:59.085 --> 00:27:01.640
You know, what's up, Willis?

00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:03.020
And he says, Willis?

00:27:03.020 --> 00:27:04.230
Nobody knows Willis.

00:27:04.230 --> 00:27:06.240
So I said, you put
Willis up there,

00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:09.120
I said, you'll get a new
positive name rather than

00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:12.670
the old Sears name
on the building.

00:27:12.670 --> 00:27:15.007
So he says, I got
to think about it.

00:27:15.007 --> 00:27:16.340
I don't know if I could do that.

00:27:16.340 --> 00:27:19.080
Comes back the next day,
he says, I could do it.

00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:22.920
He says, but I gotta tell
you, I gotta charge you.

00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:25.750
Now we've been
negotiating now for days.

00:27:25.750 --> 00:27:27.530
He said blue, I said black.

00:27:27.530 --> 00:27:29.400
He said white, I said green.

00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:32.370
We never agreed on anything
until he says that.

00:27:32.370 --> 00:27:34.630
And I say to him, OK.

00:27:34.630 --> 00:27:37.440
He's startled that
I agree with him.

00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:38.950
He says, you'll do it?

00:27:38.950 --> 00:27:40.406
I said, absolutely.

00:27:40.406 --> 00:27:41.530
He says, do we have a deal?

00:27:41.530 --> 00:27:43.780
I said, not exactly.

00:27:43.780 --> 00:27:45.710
He said, what do you want now?

00:27:45.710 --> 00:27:48.300
I said, I'll give
you a million dollars

00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:51.210
if you give me a million
dollars worth of business.

00:27:51.210 --> 00:27:53.840
Because we're not
your client, and you

00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:56.080
need to insure the building.

00:27:56.080 --> 00:27:57.460
So you give me a
million dollars,

00:27:57.460 --> 00:27:59.520
I'll give you a million dollars.

00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:02.200
I says, you do that?

00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:04.060
He says, if I do that,
do we have a deal?

00:28:04.060 --> 00:28:06.060
I said, not exactly.

00:28:06.060 --> 00:28:07.330
He said, why not?

00:28:07.330 --> 00:28:10.540
I said, your partners
who are not my clients,

00:28:10.540 --> 00:28:13.320
you've got to get them
to give me the business.

00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:17.340
So we finally
decide on the deal.

00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:20.730
And we rename the
building the Willis Tower,

00:28:20.730 --> 00:28:23.320
which is what it is
today in Chicago.

00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:26.880
I only took 3% of the building.

00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:28.090
I don't own it.

00:28:28.090 --> 00:28:30.280
I didn't own it.

00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:33.750
I used to wear my pin, and
people would say to me,

00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:37.180
are you the guy that
bought the Sears Tower?

00:28:37.180 --> 00:28:42.910
And I said to myself, I got a
long story and a short story.

00:28:42.910 --> 00:28:45.310
The long story is
too much to tell.

00:28:45.310 --> 00:28:47.935
So I said, yeah.

00:28:47.935 --> 00:28:48.435
Sure.

00:28:48.435 --> 00:28:50.840
I bought it.

00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:54.640
It's interesting, the night
we dedicated the building,

00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:57.790
Brian Williams-- the
famous Brian Williams--

00:28:57.790 --> 00:29:02.067
says to me, how after all these
years it's been called Sears--

00:29:02.067 --> 00:29:04.150
and by the way, Sears
hadn't been in that building

00:29:04.150 --> 00:29:07.270
since 1993.

00:29:07.270 --> 00:29:11.370
How is it you show up
and change the name?

00:29:11.370 --> 00:29:14.910
I said, I asked.

00:29:14.910 --> 00:29:17.860
Now, strange as that
sounds, see what

00:29:17.860 --> 00:29:20.550
it's all about is, you've
got to wake up every morning

00:29:20.550 --> 00:29:22.910
with a core belief.

00:29:22.910 --> 00:29:24.660
Whatever you want to
believe, you believe.

00:29:24.660 --> 00:29:27.090
I believe anything's possible.

00:29:27.090 --> 00:29:29.870
If you believe anything's
possible, you're going to ask.

00:29:29.870 --> 00:29:32.330
We live in a world where
the possibilities are

00:29:32.330 --> 00:29:35.820
less, and less, and less, rather
than more, and more, and more.

00:29:35.820 --> 00:29:38.760
And I tell you that story,
and I want you remember it,

00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:41.360
because don't be afraid to ask.

00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:45.550
Don't be afraid to feel
that anything is possible.

00:29:45.550 --> 00:29:52.430
By the way, today, the
Willis Tower in Chicago

00:29:52.430 --> 00:29:55.790
is now almost 100% occupied.

00:29:55.790 --> 00:29:58.550
Not because the
economy came back.

00:29:58.550 --> 00:30:02.830
But after Willis moved in
and they changed the name,

00:30:02.830 --> 00:30:06.960
United Airlines moved 2,200
people into the building.

00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:09.540
And then six months
to nine months later,

00:30:09.540 --> 00:30:12.350
United Airlines and
Continental Airlines

00:30:12.350 --> 00:30:15.550
merged to become the largest
airline in the world.

00:30:15.550 --> 00:30:18.090
And where's their headquarters?

00:30:18.090 --> 00:30:20.970
The Willis Tower in Chicago.

00:30:20.970 --> 00:30:24.300
So after all that
adversity, and after all

00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:28.360
of that upset with
the economy, my son,

00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:29.710
you've got to be positive.

00:30:29.710 --> 00:30:31.650
You've got to believe
anything is possible.

00:30:31.650 --> 00:30:34.890
And you have to face
adversity, and face your fears.

00:30:34.890 --> 00:30:37.680
And as you look at that
tower, when you see it on TV--

00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:38.620
and you will.

00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:42.190
Or somebody mentions
it-- and they will.

00:30:42.190 --> 00:30:44.380
Just remember the
story, anything's

00:30:44.380 --> 00:30:47.010
possible you gotta ask.

00:30:47.010 --> 00:30:50.750
And so the book, and I
offer you those principles,

00:30:50.750 --> 00:30:55.360
as just some idea
of what's in there.

00:30:55.360 --> 00:30:57.299
Some examples of
what's in there.

00:30:57.299 --> 00:30:58.215
Going to make you cry.

00:30:58.215 --> 00:30:59.660
It'll make you laugh.

00:30:59.660 --> 00:31:00.180
That's good.

00:31:00.180 --> 00:31:02.615
That's what we're all about,
is to cry, and to laugh,

00:31:02.615 --> 00:31:05.370
and at the end the day
feel better about life,

00:31:05.370 --> 00:31:07.140
and feel better about yourself.

00:31:07.140 --> 00:31:07.640
OK?

00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:09.514
Thank you very much for
listening, everybody.

00:31:09.514 --> 00:31:10.457
I appreciate it.

00:31:10.457 --> 00:31:13.936
[APPLAUSE]

00:31:13.936 --> 00:31:15.846
JOE PLUMERI: Shall I do Q&amp;A?

00:31:15.846 --> 00:31:16.970
Anybody have any questions?

00:31:16.970 --> 00:31:19.529
AUDIENCE: Hi, Joe, thanks
for the talk, very inspiring.

00:31:19.529 --> 00:31:20.820
JOE PLUMERI: Thanks for coming.

00:31:20.820 --> 00:31:21.520
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:31:21.520 --> 00:31:23.630
I'd like to know how many
books you have written,

00:31:23.630 --> 00:31:25.860
and what inspired you
to write about this book

00:31:25.860 --> 00:31:27.550
and share with all of us?

00:31:27.550 --> 00:31:31.410
JOE PLUMERI: As I
said in the beginning,

00:31:31.410 --> 00:31:34.830
I've always felt that,
I think technology

00:31:34.830 --> 00:31:36.330
is a wonderful thing.

00:31:36.330 --> 00:31:41.620
And I'm standing in the center
of the mecca of technology.

00:31:41.620 --> 00:31:44.640
But I think technology should
not be instead of people,

00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:47.090
it should be on
behalf of people.

00:31:47.090 --> 00:31:51.160
And I think that we overuse
our sense of connection

00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:55.450
and information, and our
communication with each other.

00:31:55.450 --> 00:32:00.710
And our society has become more
mechanical than it should be.

00:32:00.710 --> 00:32:04.170
I don't write about it in the
book, but maybe I should've.

00:32:04.170 --> 00:32:08.080
But when I took over Citibank,
I noticed that all people

00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:09.210
did all day was email.

00:32:09.210 --> 00:32:11.490
This was back in 1995.

00:32:11.490 --> 00:32:15.480
So I shut the email system off.

00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:17.610
And I don't know why I
didn't write about it.

00:32:17.610 --> 00:32:20.490
I shut the email system off,
and they thought I was crazy.

00:32:20.490 --> 00:32:23.060
Because I saw people weren't
talking to each other.

00:32:23.060 --> 00:32:24.780
And they were
emailing each other

00:32:24.780 --> 00:32:28.460
in the same floor, when they
could be talking to each other,

00:32:28.460 --> 00:32:31.090
and saying, hi, how you doing?

00:32:31.090 --> 00:32:33.762
Because again, I go
back to so many people

00:32:33.762 --> 00:32:35.720
send things because they
don't want to be there

00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:36.984
when somebody reads it.

00:32:36.984 --> 00:32:39.400
And they don't want to feel
the emotion on the other side.

00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:41.080
And I think that if
you look at history,

00:32:41.080 --> 00:32:43.840
and you look at what's
moved this country, what's

00:32:43.840 --> 00:32:46.580
moved the world, is people's
emotions, their courage,

00:32:46.580 --> 00:32:49.480
their sense of invention,
their sense of creativity.

00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:50.730
Look where I'm standing.

00:32:50.730 --> 00:32:53.550
The creativity and the
invention that took place here,

00:32:53.550 --> 00:32:56.660
because people had the
sense to take risks.

00:32:56.660 --> 00:33:00.450
And I want people to sit
around the dinner table

00:33:00.450 --> 00:33:04.910
by virtue of this book and kind
of reconnect to each other.

00:33:04.910 --> 00:33:06.600
And that's why I
tell these stories.

00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:10.430
And if I could start that
conversation and have people

00:33:10.430 --> 00:33:12.380
start to communicate
a little bit more

00:33:12.380 --> 00:33:16.550
than we do now, and start the
narrative with regard to that.

00:33:16.550 --> 00:33:18.020
I got to tell you,
you're looking

00:33:18.020 --> 00:33:20.409
at a guy that cries a lot.

00:33:20.409 --> 00:33:21.950
I don't mind telling
you I cry a lot.

00:33:21.950 --> 00:33:24.340
I've been the CEO of
a lot of companies.

00:33:24.340 --> 00:33:26.410
And nobody ever told
me I was a weak guy.

00:33:26.410 --> 00:33:31.520
Nobody ever told me that
I cry, so therefore they

00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:32.610
didn't think I was tough.

00:33:32.610 --> 00:33:33.830
I was tough.

00:33:33.830 --> 00:33:36.240
But that doesn't mean
I can't show who I am.

00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:40.140
And I think the more that we
do that, the closer our society

00:33:40.140 --> 00:33:46.140
becomes, and maybe there's less
Fergusons in the world today.

00:33:46.140 --> 00:33:49.680
So that's what inspired
me to write this book.

00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:51.290
Did that answer your question?

00:33:51.290 --> 00:33:52.018
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:33:52.018 --> 00:33:54.482
Is that the only book
that you have written?

00:33:54.482 --> 00:33:55.190
JOE PLUMERI: Yes.

00:33:55.190 --> 00:33:56.200
I'm not a writer.

00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:57.935
I'm just an Italian
kid from New Jersey.

00:34:02.740 --> 00:34:03.460
I'm not a writer.

00:34:03.460 --> 00:34:04.690
I don't do that for a living.

00:34:04.690 --> 00:34:07.260
I just had the
inspiration to want

00:34:07.260 --> 00:34:10.380
to create the
dialogue with people

00:34:10.380 --> 00:34:12.780
about what's in their heart.

00:34:12.780 --> 00:34:15.929
And hopefully more
people will be inspired

00:34:15.929 --> 00:34:18.100
to use their heart more.

00:34:18.100 --> 00:34:22.125
I think that it's really
important in our society.

00:34:22.125 --> 00:34:24.924
AUDIENCE: So you've talked a lot
about how you used your heart

00:34:24.924 --> 00:34:25.799
as your teleprompter.

00:34:25.799 --> 00:34:27.510
And I was wondering
if you could comment

00:34:27.510 --> 00:34:29.610
on your own personal
preparation process?

00:34:29.610 --> 00:34:31.346
Because obviously
when you have an hour

00:34:31.346 --> 00:34:33.179
to speak with all of
us, there's some points

00:34:33.179 --> 00:34:34.020
that you want to make.

00:34:34.020 --> 00:34:35.728
But at the same time
it's important to be

00:34:35.728 --> 00:34:38.062
genuine in your delivery of it.

00:34:38.062 --> 00:34:40.020
JOE PLUMERI: That's
a great question.

00:34:40.020 --> 00:34:47.080
Because you would have
thought that I prepare.

00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:48.650
As you can see,
I'm just talking.

00:34:52.310 --> 00:34:55.199
Friends of mine, my wife is
in the back, they're laughing.

00:34:55.199 --> 00:34:57.920
Because I've never read
a speech in my life.

00:34:57.920 --> 00:34:59.580
I never have.

00:34:59.580 --> 00:35:01.620
Because I know the subject.

00:35:01.620 --> 00:35:02.930
I know what I want to say.

00:35:02.930 --> 00:35:04.530
There's eight
principles in the book,

00:35:04.530 --> 00:35:08.810
and I just picked a few that
I thought you'd relate to.

00:35:08.810 --> 00:35:12.280
And there's lots of others
that are fun to talk about.

00:35:12.280 --> 00:35:16.420
But the preparation is the
intensity of my thinking.

00:35:16.420 --> 00:35:19.390
I don't think you
ever stop thinking

00:35:19.390 --> 00:35:20.680
about what you're doing.

00:35:20.680 --> 00:35:23.600
Lots of times my wife,
Susan, who's here with me

00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:27.820
today, she sees me
staring into the abyss,

00:35:27.820 --> 00:35:30.820
or staring at a wall.

00:35:30.820 --> 00:35:32.840
And she says, what
are you doing?

00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:37.100
And she knows I'm
processing in my mind what

00:35:37.100 --> 00:35:39.610
I want to say to you guys.

00:35:39.610 --> 00:35:41.970
But at the end of
day, it starts here,

00:35:41.970 --> 00:35:44.650
but it comes out over here.

00:35:44.650 --> 00:35:47.080
So the filter is not a big one.

00:35:47.080 --> 00:35:52.560
But if you feel it inside of
you, and it's what you are,

00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:55.830
and who you are, then the
integrity shines through.

00:35:55.830 --> 00:35:58.470
You can tell whether
I'm a fake or not

00:35:58.470 --> 00:36:00.420
by virtue of the way I do it.

00:36:00.420 --> 00:36:03.220
So that's the way I process it.

00:36:03.220 --> 00:36:04.020
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:36:04.020 --> 00:36:05.030
JOE PLUMERI: OK?

00:36:05.030 --> 00:36:06.640
AUDIENCE: So much
of our schooling

00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:10.210
is focused on mathematics,
and that sort of preparation

00:36:10.210 --> 00:36:11.460
for the business world.

00:36:11.460 --> 00:36:13.510
Do you think it's
important to instill

00:36:13.510 --> 00:36:17.680
this relationship-building and
other things in kids early on?

00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:21.140
And if so, what is the
appropriate mechanism to do so?

00:36:21.140 --> 00:36:24.940
JOE PLUMERI: Thank you, Angela,
that's a very good question.

00:36:24.940 --> 00:36:28.650
In my day, they called
that liberal arts,

00:36:28.650 --> 00:36:31.090
versus the sciences.

00:36:31.090 --> 00:36:33.170
I think it's really important.

00:36:33.170 --> 00:36:39.260
I think not only
when you're a child.

00:36:39.260 --> 00:36:44.670
And today the sense
of competitiveness,

00:36:44.670 --> 00:36:47.560
a sense of striving.

00:36:47.560 --> 00:36:50.150
Browning said, your reach
should exceed your grasp,

00:36:50.150 --> 00:36:51.770
or what's a heaven for?

00:36:51.770 --> 00:36:56.450
And we seem to be breeding
in a society today

00:36:56.450 --> 00:37:01.310
a class of children, or
people, where average is good.

00:37:01.310 --> 00:37:02.870
I don't think that's good.

00:37:02.870 --> 00:37:05.810
I don't think the people who
founded this place sought

00:37:05.810 --> 00:37:06.430
to be average.

00:37:06.430 --> 00:37:10.470
I think they sought to be
different, and extraordinary.

00:37:10.470 --> 00:37:14.540
So I think as kids
are in school,

00:37:14.540 --> 00:37:18.220
it's really important to instill
in them a sense of who they

00:37:18.220 --> 00:37:25.190
are, allow them to speak the way
they think they should speak,

00:37:25.190 --> 00:37:26.740
and what they feel.

00:37:26.740 --> 00:37:28.770
When you go to
business schools today,

00:37:28.770 --> 00:37:30.490
and I speak at business
schools, there's

00:37:30.490 --> 00:37:34.550
very little taught about what it
really takes to run a company.

00:37:34.550 --> 00:37:36.400
You got to know
about balance sheets,

00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:39.490
and you've got to know about
income statements, and taxes,

00:37:39.490 --> 00:37:41.160
and all that kind of stuff.

00:37:41.160 --> 00:37:45.020
But I really think what's
important is inspiring people.

00:37:45.020 --> 00:37:47.270
And they don't
teach inspiration.

00:37:47.270 --> 00:37:50.400
They don't teach motivation.

00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:54.210
There's a principle in
the book, show the way

00:37:54.210 --> 00:37:55.150
to grandma's house.

00:37:55.150 --> 00:38:00.860
And grandma's house is
a metaphor for vision.

00:38:00.860 --> 00:38:09.480
That as a child you went
on a trip with your parents

00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:11.240
someplace for a long distance.

00:38:11.240 --> 00:38:14.720
And eventually,
you got impatient.

00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:19.380
And eventually you asked, when
are we going to get there?

00:38:19.380 --> 00:38:21.120
Everybody goes through it.

00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:24.390
And the parent usually
responds by making up

00:38:24.390 --> 00:38:28.030
something that gives you a
vision of how exciting it's

00:38:28.030 --> 00:38:30.060
going to be when you
get there, if you'd just

00:38:30.060 --> 00:38:32.470
be patient, and settle down.

00:38:32.470 --> 00:38:36.010
So in a way, that's a
vision for the future.

00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:38.972
Companies should do
that for employees.

00:38:38.972 --> 00:38:40.680
People like me should
get up and say, let

00:38:40.680 --> 00:38:42.000
me tell you where we're going.

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:45.020
Let me tell you my view
of grandma's house.

00:38:45.020 --> 00:38:46.610
This is where we're going.

00:38:46.610 --> 00:38:49.870
And it's going to have cake, and
ice cream, and candy, and toys,

00:38:49.870 --> 00:38:52.140
and all the things
that are nice.

00:38:52.140 --> 00:38:54.750
Or put that in
terms of business.

00:38:54.750 --> 00:38:56.950
And the reason
that's important is

00:38:56.950 --> 00:38:58.760
so you could endure the trip.

00:38:58.760 --> 00:39:00.480
Why do you show up every day?

00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:03.290
What's your participation,
or contribution

00:39:03.290 --> 00:39:05.940
for what you do to
make the place better,

00:39:05.940 --> 00:39:07.180
to get to grandma's house?

00:39:07.180 --> 00:39:10.360
And I don't think they teach
that anymore in school.

00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:11.850
People just show up.

00:39:11.850 --> 00:39:14.460
And you get paid,
hopefully well.

00:39:14.460 --> 00:39:16.576
But there's no
sense of really what

00:39:16.576 --> 00:39:21.250
do I have to do with what
happens when we get there?

00:39:21.250 --> 00:39:23.270
So I am a big proponent.

00:39:23.270 --> 00:39:26.620
I've said that business schools,
I've said that at universities.

00:39:26.620 --> 00:39:29.430
I think we need to do
more and more to instill

00:39:29.430 --> 00:39:31.420
that in our children.

00:39:31.420 --> 00:39:34.190
Frankly, I have a granddaughter
who's 13 years old.

00:39:34.190 --> 00:39:36.250
And there's a lot
of conversation

00:39:36.250 --> 00:39:38.780
that goes on with a
machine, and very little

00:39:38.780 --> 00:39:40.290
that goes on with the talking.

00:39:40.290 --> 00:39:42.200
And so when you sit down
and you have dinner,

00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:44.510
and there's no machine,
it's very difficult

00:39:44.510 --> 00:39:46.944
to converse when you're
not used to doing that.

00:39:46.944 --> 00:39:48.860
Because you could say a
whole bunch of things.

00:39:48.860 --> 00:39:50.818
And somebody says a whole
bunch of things back.

00:39:50.818 --> 00:39:53.940
And believe me, I am
not anti-technology.

00:39:53.940 --> 00:39:56.930
I just don't think it
should be instead of people.

00:39:56.930 --> 00:39:57.760
That's all.

00:39:57.760 --> 00:40:01.940
And I think we need to reinstill
that back into our society.

00:40:01.940 --> 00:40:03.700
AUDIENCE: Joe, thanks
so much for joining.

00:40:03.700 --> 00:40:07.120
Your thoughts, sharing them
has been great to hear.

00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:10.246
The optimism, and dynamism
heard from your story,

00:40:10.246 --> 00:40:11.120
from what you shared.

00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:14.280
So my one question was,
I wonder if there's maybe

00:40:14.280 --> 00:40:17.750
a certain point, kind of
a specific time, or place,

00:40:17.750 --> 00:40:20.050
or an experience where it
all kind of clicked for you.

00:40:20.050 --> 00:40:24.340
And you felt that having
the optimistic path to life

00:40:24.340 --> 00:40:27.850
is the way to go, as
opposed to maybe being

00:40:27.850 --> 00:40:30.190
a little more realistic,
or being a bit more

00:40:30.190 --> 00:40:31.380
pessimistic about things.

00:40:33.980 --> 00:40:35.695
Or maybe you were
always like that?

00:40:35.695 --> 00:40:38.070
JOE PLUMERI: You're asking me
a very good question, which

00:40:38.070 --> 00:40:42.900
makes me think whether there was
any defining moment, which is

00:40:42.900 --> 00:40:44.860
what I think you're asking me.

00:40:44.860 --> 00:40:47.440
And I don't think I
had a defining moment.

00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:50.730
I had a defining father.

00:40:50.730 --> 00:40:56.090
This guy thought that
nothing could ever go wrong.

00:40:56.090 --> 00:40:57.860
When you're hanging
around role models

00:40:57.860 --> 00:41:02.580
like that that are positive,
it's really infectious.

00:41:02.580 --> 00:41:04.922
And he just never
believed-- it's in the book,

00:41:04.922 --> 00:41:07.255
by the way-- that's why I
can't tell you the whole book,

00:41:07.255 --> 00:41:08.213
then you won't read it.

00:41:08.213 --> 00:41:11.150
But it's in the book
how positive he was.

00:41:11.150 --> 00:41:16.340
But I'll tell you a story, and
it talks about what he did.

00:41:16.340 --> 00:41:20.170
And when you read that, you'll
see where it comes from.

00:41:20.170 --> 00:41:22.550
Because all my
life, I watched him.

00:41:22.550 --> 00:41:24.310
And I watched him
engage with people.

00:41:24.310 --> 00:41:26.720
And I watched him be optimistic.

00:41:26.720 --> 00:41:32.140
And I watched him just
be such an influence just

00:41:32.140 --> 00:41:33.200
by hanging around him.

00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:35.715
So there was no
defining moment for me.

00:41:35.715 --> 00:41:37.860
But there was just like
a whole bunch of time

00:41:37.860 --> 00:41:41.490
that I saw him be positive.

00:41:41.490 --> 00:41:46.490
There's a piece in the book
where he used to come and watch

00:41:46.490 --> 00:41:47.360
all my ball games.

00:41:47.360 --> 00:41:49.680
I played sports.

00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:51.955
And one of the stories I
didn't tell in the book,

00:41:51.955 --> 00:41:53.930
so I'm going to tell you.

00:41:53.930 --> 00:41:55.930
And the guy who helped
me write the book,

00:41:55.930 --> 00:41:57.140
Steve Kettmann's in the back.

00:41:57.140 --> 00:42:01.450
And I think of all
these things now.

00:42:01.450 --> 00:42:03.320
I played football in college.

00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:06.455
And you can tell how good I was.

00:42:06.455 --> 00:42:09.320
And how good the team was.

00:42:09.320 --> 00:42:14.090
We went to play the
University of Virginia.

00:42:14.090 --> 00:42:19.240
And they had lost 27 games in
a row, or something like that.

00:42:19.240 --> 00:42:22.550
And if we beat them, they
would have set the NCAA record

00:42:22.550 --> 00:42:24.950
for consecutive
losses or something.

00:42:24.950 --> 00:42:27.430
And so we went to
Charlottesville to play them.

00:42:27.430 --> 00:42:29.590
And I had such a terrible day.

00:42:29.590 --> 00:42:30.380
I fumbled.

00:42:30.380 --> 00:42:32.110
It was just everything wrong.

00:42:32.110 --> 00:42:35.030
And they won because of me.

00:42:35.030 --> 00:42:39.720
And so I get in the locker
room, and my head was down.

00:42:39.720 --> 00:42:43.780
And I saw these shoes
show up in front of me.

00:42:43.780 --> 00:42:46.320
And it was my father's shoes.

00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:48.950
And he said, why's
your head down?

00:42:48.950 --> 00:42:52.200
And I looked up, I said, I
didn't play well-- or something

00:42:52.200 --> 00:42:53.110
like that.

00:42:53.110 --> 00:42:54.530
And he said, what do mean?

00:42:54.530 --> 00:42:55.532
You had a great day.

00:42:55.532 --> 00:42:56.990
I said, what are
you talking about?

00:42:56.990 --> 00:43:00.010
He says, 40,000 people
now know who you are.

00:43:03.970 --> 00:43:11.410
When you have that kind
of influence-- and you'll

00:43:11.410 --> 00:43:13.900
see that we owned
the baseball team.

00:43:13.900 --> 00:43:16.875
And I remember one
time-- and again, I

00:43:16.875 --> 00:43:18.590
didn't put it in the book.

00:43:18.590 --> 00:43:22.610
Our team, it was a minor league
affiliate of the Yankees.

00:43:22.610 --> 00:43:24.110
I don't know, we
lost 16 to nothing.

00:43:24.110 --> 00:43:25.651
And he'd always go
into the clubhouse

00:43:25.651 --> 00:43:27.840
after the end of each game.

00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:29.430
And he would say, great game.

00:43:29.430 --> 00:43:30.140
Great game.

00:43:30.140 --> 00:43:31.577
We lost 16 to nothing.

00:43:31.577 --> 00:43:33.160
And the coach would
say, how could you

00:43:33.160 --> 00:43:34.590
say we had a great game?

00:43:34.590 --> 00:43:36.430
He'd say, Oh,
everybody tried hard.

00:43:36.430 --> 00:43:38.617
Everybody did the
best they could.

00:43:38.617 --> 00:43:39.950
That was the kind of guy he was.

00:43:39.950 --> 00:43:42.640
So when you hang around
that all your life,

00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:44.990
which goes to another message.

00:43:44.990 --> 00:43:48.910
Hang around people that
are positive influences.

00:43:48.910 --> 00:43:51.970
Stay close to people who
can be helpful to you,

00:43:51.970 --> 00:43:55.620
and not drag you
down, but pick you up.

00:43:55.620 --> 00:43:58.380
You got those choices.

00:43:58.380 --> 00:44:03.054
And I think that's
where I got mine from.

00:44:03.054 --> 00:44:05.700
AUDIENCE: So it sounds like it's
almost kind of this tendency

00:44:05.700 --> 00:44:08.295
to resilience, which
maybe you cultivated just

00:44:08.295 --> 00:44:11.066
from seeing your dad,
and going through that.

00:44:11.066 --> 00:44:14.800
JOE PLUMERI: Yeah,
and again, I think

00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:17.970
you are a product of something.

00:44:17.970 --> 00:44:21.680
And I was a product
of what I saw.

00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:24.070
And I was lucky
enough-- I could have

00:44:24.070 --> 00:44:25.860
seen something
else that would've

00:44:25.860 --> 00:44:27.450
been not as productive.

00:44:27.450 --> 00:44:31.550
But I had the privilege,
and the good fortune

00:44:31.550 --> 00:44:33.840
of seeing somebody that
had a positive influence.

00:44:33.840 --> 00:44:36.450
The guy just wouldn't give up.

00:44:36.450 --> 00:44:38.390
He just kept bouncing
back up again.

00:44:38.390 --> 00:44:39.306
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:44:39.306 --> 00:44:42.490
JOE PLUMERI: Yeah, and so that's
why I think it's important.

00:44:42.490 --> 00:44:44.220
And there are subtle messages.

00:44:44.220 --> 00:44:51.050
And you'll see, cut a path is
the principle in the book which

00:44:51.050 --> 00:44:53.070
talks about my father
and my grandfather,

00:44:53.070 --> 00:44:57.880
and the legacy in my family
of always cutting a path.

00:44:57.880 --> 00:44:59.490
There's choices
you have in life.

00:44:59.490 --> 00:45:01.990
I gave you one of them, pain
of discipline, pain of regret.

00:45:01.990 --> 00:45:05.990
The other one is, cut a
path and leave a trail.

00:45:05.990 --> 00:45:10.260
Or let somebody else cut the
path, and you follow them.

00:45:10.260 --> 00:45:14.260
In business, first
to the market wins.

00:45:14.260 --> 00:45:17.260
In life, I think you
just go cut a path,

00:45:17.260 --> 00:45:20.390
and then wait for everybody
else to want to follow you.

00:45:20.390 --> 00:45:23.050
They're not the ones
that are the winners.

00:45:23.050 --> 00:45:26.180
This place is a great
example of that.

00:45:26.180 --> 00:45:30.390
So he was always a person that
cut a path, and left a trail.

00:45:30.390 --> 00:45:32.680
And I've always
been the same way.

00:45:32.680 --> 00:45:35.240
And in business, it's called
be the first to the market,

00:45:35.240 --> 00:45:36.510
and you win.

00:45:36.510 --> 00:45:39.820
Same thing with your customers.

00:45:39.820 --> 00:45:42.610
If you have a customer, you
don't sell them, you help them.

00:45:42.610 --> 00:45:44.740
It's subtle things
like that make

00:45:44.740 --> 00:45:48.952
you feel and want people to do
better, and they're positive.

00:45:48.952 --> 00:45:51.160
AUDIENCE: So my question
is, you mentioned

00:45:51.160 --> 00:45:54.390
that you kind of regret
not having spent more time

00:45:54.390 --> 00:45:55.930
with your son before he passed.

00:45:55.930 --> 00:45:58.660
After he did pass
away, did you see

00:45:58.660 --> 00:46:00.905
a change in kind of
the amount of time

00:46:00.905 --> 00:46:03.470
you spent with either
family, or time you took off,

00:46:03.470 --> 00:46:07.070
or in terms of how
much you worked

00:46:07.070 --> 00:46:08.590
as a learning out of that?

00:46:08.590 --> 00:46:12.431
And then what kind of things you
recommend for people these days

00:46:12.431 --> 00:46:12.930
to kind of--

00:46:12.930 --> 00:46:14.530
JOE PLUMERI: The answer is yes.

00:46:14.530 --> 00:46:15.570
I have.

00:46:15.570 --> 00:46:18.640
And frankly, when I was
on a plane last night,

00:46:18.640 --> 00:46:20.610
I asked my wife.

00:46:20.610 --> 00:46:28.410
He had a daughter, who's now 13,
who my ex-wife and I adopted.

00:46:28.410 --> 00:46:30.200
And her name is Elizabeth.

00:46:30.200 --> 00:46:33.970
And so I'm the father,
and the grandfather.

00:46:33.970 --> 00:46:37.886
And I worry that I don't
spend enough time with her.

00:46:37.886 --> 00:46:39.510
I mentioned that to
my wife last night.

00:46:39.510 --> 00:46:44.340
I said, I gotta spend
more time with Elizabeth.

00:46:44.340 --> 00:46:47.570
I don't know that I could
even ask that question

00:46:47.570 --> 00:46:49.280
before the tragedy.

00:46:49.280 --> 00:46:52.570
I wouldn't have even asked it.

00:46:52.570 --> 00:46:55.660
I think I'm pretty close
to my other children,

00:46:55.660 --> 00:46:58.861
but I get paranoid that I'm not.

00:46:58.861 --> 00:47:00.860
Because when you go through
something like that,

00:47:00.860 --> 00:47:03.660
you're constantly
questioning whether you're

00:47:03.660 --> 00:47:05.680
doing the right thing or not.

00:47:05.680 --> 00:47:08.180
Whether you said the
right thing or not.

00:47:08.180 --> 00:47:10.090
But I think it's healthy.

00:47:10.090 --> 00:47:13.760
I think it's healthy that
I constantly question,

00:47:13.760 --> 00:47:15.565
am I doing this right?

00:47:15.565 --> 00:47:20.390
Or I constantly question,
am I spending enough time

00:47:20.390 --> 00:47:21.510
like I should?

00:47:21.510 --> 00:47:23.510
All because of the
experience that I had.

00:47:23.510 --> 00:47:26.910
And as long as I keep
questioning myself,

00:47:26.910 --> 00:47:29.410
I think that's healthy.

00:47:29.410 --> 00:47:32.860
So my recommendation
would be, don't

00:47:32.860 --> 00:47:35.200
go through what I went through.

00:47:35.200 --> 00:47:38.930
But keep questioning everything
that you do personally

00:47:38.930 --> 00:47:40.675
with your friends,
or with your family.

00:47:40.675 --> 00:47:43.550
And question whether
or not the relationship

00:47:43.550 --> 00:47:47.760
is as tight as it should be, and
as heartfelt as it should be.

00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:49.990
AUDIENCE: Just really
quickly, on the subject

00:47:49.990 --> 00:47:50.990
of questioning yourself.

00:47:50.990 --> 00:47:54.666
How do you balance questioning
yourself versus confidence?

00:47:54.666 --> 00:47:57.490
JOE PLUMERI: Questioning
yourself versus confidence?

00:47:57.490 --> 00:48:00.390
I go back to swagger.

00:48:00.390 --> 00:48:02.154
You know the word swagger?

00:48:02.154 --> 00:48:04.070
Everybody always says,
that guy's got swagger.

00:48:04.070 --> 00:48:05.590
That lady has swagger, right?

00:48:05.590 --> 00:48:09.180
And there's something
cool about swagger.

00:48:09.180 --> 00:48:12.800
And so I always try to
think about what swagger

00:48:12.800 --> 00:48:14.990
would be if you defined it.

00:48:14.990 --> 00:48:16.810
And this is what swagger is.

00:48:16.810 --> 00:48:18.340
You ready?

00:48:18.340 --> 00:48:23.220
North of confident,
and south of arrogant.

00:48:23.220 --> 00:48:24.320
You've got it?

00:48:27.260 --> 00:48:29.530
You want to be around
confident people,

00:48:29.530 --> 00:48:32.451
but you don't want to be around
people that are arrogant.

00:48:32.451 --> 00:48:32.950
Right?

00:48:32.950 --> 00:48:35.610
You want to be around,
this is a confident person

00:48:35.610 --> 00:48:40.510
who has a sense of class, style,
and has respect for people.

00:48:40.510 --> 00:48:43.720
And so you want to stay south
of arrogant, north of confident,

00:48:43.720 --> 00:48:48.660
and that land right there
is where you want to be.

00:48:48.660 --> 00:48:49.880
And that's swagger.

00:48:49.880 --> 00:48:51.890
And always keep
asking yourself, did I

00:48:51.890 --> 00:48:54.220
do something that was confident?

00:48:54.220 --> 00:48:56.950
Or did I go above the
line of arrogance?

00:48:56.950 --> 00:48:57.970
OK?

00:48:57.970 --> 00:48:58.660
Got it?

00:48:58.660 --> 00:49:01.120
North of confident,
south of arrogant

00:49:01.120 --> 00:49:04.430
is the swagger you want
to have every day, when

00:49:04.430 --> 00:49:06.780
you think anything's possible.

00:49:06.780 --> 00:49:07.620
OK?

00:49:07.620 --> 00:49:10.110
I want to really thank
you guys for coming today.

00:49:10.110 --> 00:49:11.360
It's really been a lot of fun.

00:49:11.360 --> 00:49:11.990
I appreciate it.

00:49:11.990 --> 00:49:14.280
I appreciate you giving me the
opportunity to talk to you,

00:49:14.280 --> 00:49:15.450
and spend the time with you.

00:49:15.450 --> 00:49:15.949
Thank you.

00:49:15.949 --> 00:49:20.840
[APPLAUSE]
