Speaker 1:          00:00          [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          00:05          So for you, for ion, it's not just academic. Where do you think the bravery comes in for you? I, cause I can tell there's nothing that I could possibly ask you here that you wouldn't give me the clearest, honest answer. And that isn't always how it is with everybody, obviously as an interviewer. But where do you think that comes from? Candor as well as being one of my greatest weaknesses. I think

Speaker 3:          00:29          I was probably brought up in a rather combative family in a rather competence part of the world. I grew up in, in Glasgow, in the west of Scotland and

Speaker 2:          00:39          to a physician and a, and a physics.

Speaker 3:          00:42          That's right. My mother was a physics teacher. My father was a doctor. Yeah. Uh, and they were the first in their families to go to university. My grandfathers had served in the world wars. Uh, Scots have a self image of themselves as being a courageous. The Scottish regiments were famous. I wrote about this in my, one of my earliest books. The busy of war were famously the sharp end of, of the British military. Uh, we marched towards the sound of gunfire. Bagpipes playing. That's the self image that uh, a small Scottish boy growing up in the 1960s and seventies was encouraged to have. I remember vividly the day that nine 11 happened. I was sitting in Oxford where I was then teaching, but planning I'd planned and was intending to fly to New York, uh, very shortly to give a lecture on nine 12 at New York University.

Speaker 3:          01:42          Uh, indeed I was booked into a hotel very close to the World Trade Center and my response when I saw the attacks was somewhat a bloody minded. My response was very shortly afterwards to resign my post docs for them go to New York University and I taught there for two years in a, I suppose a mood of defiance that the attempt to terrorize would not terrorize me when I met a on a nine more than nine years ago now, it never crossed my mind as I fell in love with her, which happened very fast, that this implied some meaningful, a threat to my person. Even when the FBI came to tell me that there had been a threat against me, something that I'd seen them due to a on them more than one occasion. I never gave it a second thought because obviously my calling different from my grandfathers who were called to fight in real wars.

Speaker 3:          02:55          My more much more manageable callings is to protect her. She's one of the great heroines of our time and extraordinary courageous woman who's been through a hell of a lot and who has never shirked from seeing what she believes is wrong with modern Islam. So it, it is second nature to me to be there with her in that, in that fight, in that war, that's what it turns out to be. My warm, I always used to wonder as I was growing up, why is it that my generation isn't really been called on to fight wars the way my grandfather's generations were called on and then it turned up. Then my water turned up.

Speaker 2:          03:42          You briefly mentioned this earlier when you're talking about ion and Brandeis, but can you explain this intersection of Islamism and the left, how, why this has occurred? This confuses a lot of people, this idea of the oppression Olympics and you know, I've got plenty of theories on this that we've knocked out, but, but what do you think it is that has attracted something that is completely totalitarian and control with another thing that's so completely total? I mean, I guess that's the answer right there.

Speaker 3:          04:11          Well, there are many unholy alliances in, in history and uh, no don't. Many people will gravely, uh, surprised when the Ribbentrop Molotov pat was announced and the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany formed an alliance. So we shouldn't be entirely surprised when seemingly odd bedfellows jump into bed. In the case of the Islamists and the left, I think it's pretty clear to me that the Islamists are the, the leading partner and the leftists are broadly the useful idiots because the Islamists have a strategy. It's there in Muslim Brotherhood and other documents for expanding their network in the west. And part of the strategy is the kind of a partnership that they have formed on campuses against, uh, against her foes. One way in which this works is that you use the issue of Israel, uh, to forge the packs with the left. So you get the left's longstanding animosity towards Zionism, uh, and you essentially say, well, we entirely agree with you about that.

Speaker 3:          05:40          Let's, let's have an event about how wicked Israel is. Uh, and so that's the gateway drug into accepting. The next thing is, well, headscarves are actually empowering for women, don't you think? Uh, and isn't it actually Islamophobia to be in any way of Sharia law. So you play the multiculturalists cultural relativist card, uh, and you again depict any critics of radical Islam as it, as in fact, uh, engaged in some kind of orientalist project, uh, or essential list project to other people. Always talk about othering and academia, uh, Muslims. And you blur the distinction between Islam, Islamism and Muslims as people. So this has been going on for awhile and the left has broadly fallen for it. And it, to me, it's just astonishing. I remember looking at the list of academics who had, who had argued that I aren't, should not receive an honorary degree at Brandeis and it included professors of Queer Studies, uh, female professors of gender studies.

Speaker 3:          06:48          It's incredible. You kind of feel like saying to these people, have you taken a look at what the Muslim Brotherhood envisages have you read Khatibs works? Do you realize that the project is the permanent demotion of women to second class status and potentially a capital punishment for gays? Is, is that something you are aware of? And I can only conclude that they aren't aware of it and, and have been very thoroughly duped as useful. Idiots usually are. So it was that basically, because both of these movements want power. So the useful idiot part of this is that Islam is a really just using the left who attain power and they're doing it all in the name of diversity and all of these things. And eventually once that power is attained, then for lack of a better expression, I mean, you basically decapitate them and then you've got, they did it for you.

Speaker 3:          07:41          They did the work for you. Yes. I mean, I always used to joke with ion that, uh, when we lived in Cambridge, it would be fun if all my enemies and all her enemies came and protested outside our house together because after about 20 minutes a day, they'd fall on one another and they would be the most tremendous fight. I do think that power is part of it, but if one looks back at the history of another intolerance, totalitarian ideology of Marxism, there's a combination of power and are a kind of idealism, one must call it that, uh, in the square in the Torah. I tell the story of how the Soviet successfully penetrated the British establishment by recruiting spies and Cambridge and the people they recruited had leanings to the left that were inspired partly by revulsion at those aspects of, of British imperialism or British class society that work in many ways a legitimately open to criticism.

Speaker 3:          08:52          There was an idealism there at the beginning of guide Burgess's involvement in Marxism, sympathy with workers during the time of the Great Depression, but those were the useful idiots that the Soviet cynically recruited to be spies who, whom they persuaded to betray their countrymen in what was the single most successful act of, of Russian espionage of them all recruiting these highly educated people from an incredibly exclusive network, the Cambridge Apostles and the related network that led to Bloomsbury. This was a brilliant strategy. Something similar is going on here because I think there are great many naive young people who are drawn to the rhetoric of social justice. I encounter them often, people who say, oh, there should be limits on free speech because I don't want such and such, uh, such and such as feelings to be hurt. And then naive. They have a very naive view.

Speaker 3:          09:48          Somehow that can be a circumscribed form of free speech and know in which nobody's feelings get hurt. That's not the pursuit of power. That's just naive city. And the people who know how to exploit that naive city are both people amongst the Islamists and people amongst the leftists who are pursuing power. But you can never really get to power without the useful idiots without the naive idealists who think that they're going to build utopia with your hell. Yeah. And I don't have to tell you, they're usually ends up in dystopia. Right. So, and that's, that's something that is hard to persuade people of your, I keep reflecting on the curious revival of, of Margaret Atwood's the Handmaid's tale, which is always taken to be a vision of what happens when right wing people, uh, take over America. And to me, the amazing thing that is almost never observed is that, uh, something very like this has happened.

Speaker 3:          10:47          It happened in Iran after 1979 and it happened after the Taliban came to power enough Ghana's Stan. So we don't need to fantasize about crazy evangelical fascists turning women into baby machines. This has already happened, but it was done by Islamists. It was done by people pursuing an extreme version of, of Sharia. And yet almost nobody who enthuses about, uh, Margaret Atwood's book realizes that it is actually really quite powerful realization of what a theocratic Islam as regime does to women. All right. So I want to shift gears a little bit here and we can either, I'm going to let you choose. We can either go the historical root or we can go the present route. Where, where are you feeling first? I do want to do both. I think the key to applied history, which is what I've spent my whole life doing is that you do both and you can't do one without the other because no, you can have no real insight about the present without the past. So why don't we talk about the president and our try to show why to understand that you need history. All right, very good. So, uh, there are a couple of things that are interesting

Speaker 2:          11:53          that you've, you've staked out positions out over the past couple of years. Uh, we briefly, right before we sat down, we talked about Brexit for a second. So you originally were for, were against Brexit. Yeah. Then you came around for it. Now it seems to be in this odd limbo that I think, unfortunately, most people in America don't even understand what's, what's going on. I don't think most people in Britain on this plan. I'm sure. Um, so when I was reading your position on this, I at first I thought, well wait a minute. As a, as a conservative and as someone that wants some autonomy over his country, I was somewhat surprised actually that you weren't for it originally. So can you explain your original position and then how you changed on that?

Speaker 3:          12:32          The two reasons, um, while I was on the side of remain, remain in the EU, uh, back in 2016, one was pure personal loyalty to friends. Uh, David Cameron was prime minister. George Osborne was chancellor of the Exchequer and they are friends of mine. And I, I felt obliged as a friend to support them when they decided, uh, to stick with the EU and not to recommend Brexit.

Speaker 2:          13:01          Did, did that friendship supersede what your feelings were or was that because you really trust

Speaker 3:          13:05          well, that was, they could get it done. The swung. Okay. And I think the reason that I was willing to, to, to get on board with Romaine was that I found that arguments of the Brexiteers deeply unconvincing. Uh, I remember one night sitting down and reading a lot of stuff by Daniel Hannon, one of the deeding advocates of, uh, of leaving. And I remember thinking that this was just intellectually, completely third class and unconvincing the s the notion that Britain would be better off economically outside the European Union, wouldn't have passed muster as, uh, an undergraduate paper, nevermind a graduate of paper. So I felt that the Brexiteers case failed intellectually because they were claiming implausibly I thought that you could have a free lunch, that you could leave the European Union and be better off. And that just seemed to me to be intellectually completely deceitful. I think it would have been harder for me if they had said, honestly, this is going to cost quite a bit, but it's worth it because if we leave, then we shall have the ability to control our borders.

Speaker 3:          14:20          Uh, and we shall have a autonomy at a time when Europe is pursuing a federalist course. But that wasn't the argument. The argument was that at the area, cause [inaudible] here are going to get the money. This was the argument. We get together, money that we give to the European Union and we'll get to build spend on the national health service cause we will be in fact better off. And that was a lie. And I'm not good with lies. It was a clever lie. It works politically. And I give credit to Dominic Cummings for crafting a message that was a PD both to conservatives until the voters, the Conservatives got immigration control, Labor voters got the national health service, gets the money. So this was brilliant politically, but it was mendacious I think heart. And so I, I oppose the, uh, Brexit when it happened. Uh, what struck me in the subsequent months was that while I had been, while I had been on the side that lost, there was a good reason why we lost.

Speaker 3:          15:25          And the good reason was that we went around saying how much it was going to cost. And I think we were right about that. I think ultimately, at least some of what the Treasury said, we'll try, we'll turn out to be true about the cost. But that wasn't what people cared about. And when you went into pubs, as I did in, in in Wales, in England, and in Scotland, there was a question to which you could not give an honest answer without losing the debate. And I'll tell you what that question was because I was asked it multiple times. You'd make the case about the cost. Nobody was interested in the cost. They would say, listen, Neil, about the 1.3 million Muslims, the Germans have just let in to Germany, because that had just happened. If the Germans give them German passports, can they come here? And the only honest answer to that question was yes.

Speaker 4:          16:18          Yeah.

Speaker 3:          16:19          So immigration was the issue. And I think for a significant number of people are in England and Wales especially, was less so in Scotland where Brexit was defeated. The realization was that Britain had lost control of immigration, that people had been promised net migration in the tens of thousands in the 1990s under the Blair government. And they'd ended up with net migration in the hundreds of thousands. They saw the chaos in Germany. They saw the waves of migration coming on and from Syria, but from all over North Africa and uh, and even South Asia. And they said, and I remember David Cameron using this phrase, get me out of here. And that was, that was the driving motivation for the Brexit vote. And I think it was legitimate because I think that Angela Merkel had made a catastrophic mistake in throwing open the gates. I think it will have dark consequences for the future of, of Germany and of Europe.

Speaker 3:          17:19          And I do not blame British voters for saying, forget about the cost of Brexit. We really need to get out of this. So I take, took the view by the end of 2016 that you had to, you had to respect the fact that ordinary people had cut through the crap of the debate and had got to the heart of the matter are. And the heart of the matter wasn't the cost of Brexit. Uh, which is what I had, I think mistakenly focused on prior to the reference. What was it like you as a public person and you know, someone that writes about this stuff and puts your opinions out there to, to have that realization. I think it's very important if you write regularly, if you are what we call a public intellectual, uh, to be willing to admit that you've been wrong. I think you have to be prepared to say I was wrong.

Speaker 3:          18:09          And I, I think I was wrong in the sense that what I wish I had done looking back was, I wish I had said to David Cameron and George Osborne in the spring of 2016 when it was clear that the Europeans were going to make no meaningful concession on the immigration issue when they basically sent an insulting proposal about what could be done about migration. That was the moment I should have said to Cameron and Osborne, forget it. Yeah, you should campaign for Brexit if that's all they're going to offer you. If they're so completely oblivious to the very real concerns about immigration, then you should campaign for Brexit instead of which we stuck with it. And that was, that was David Cameron's great mistake. He should have said at that moment, if that's all you've got, I'm going to recommend Brexit to the voters and it would have saved him too.

Speaker 3:          19:04          So, so you'd think it was just a bad negotiating ploy that he just didn't use some leverage to say we're going to have to walk away from this. There was, there was a moment when he should have walked away and I should have advised them to walk away. So yeah, I think one has to recognize when one's made a mistake with such consequences. The second thing, which is worth knowing about this is that the people who then inherited power after the fall of Cameron and Osborne, we're not the people who had campaigned for and one on Brexit. It was people who'd been on the remain side. Theresa May became prime minister. Uh, I always knew that would be a disaster. I did not have high regard for her prior to the referendum. The Daily Mail essentially put her in that position and also Boris Johnson, Michael Gove and others because they bungled, uh, the leadership contest.

Speaker 3:          19:55          So we then ended up with a terrible combination, which was a commitment to Brexit, but it's execution in the hands of people who had been remainers. And I think the result is the worst of both worlds because right now we essentially have the psychological reality of Brexit. I think British public to a large extent has accepted that we are leaving, but the execution is a total mess by invoking article 50 early on, the UK in essentially seeded the, the power and the divorce to the European Union and the concessions have come one after another. Ever since then. And we now find ourselves in the odd predicament that I think Theresa May is saying that Brexit means you cease to be a voting member of the European Union, but you remain within the customs union, potentially even within the single market and you accept all the rules and regulations of the European Union.

Speaker 3:          20:55          You just don't have any power. If that's the end game, then it's a disaster. So the people that are trying to stop this now, they want to invoke some, some pretty crazy extreme stuff, right? I mean there would be some really, very rarely if ever used rules, am I right about this that would actually allow this to allow the stay to occur? Well Anderson, I think those games without getting into all of them, I knew everything. There is a level of complexity in the discussions now in London that is bewildering to most ordinary British people when people start talking about Max Fac and the customs union or the complexity. That's why it's such a confusing way. Cause I discussed it with Douglas Murray and he was even a little confused. So it's actually not confusing in the sense that what is happening is that Theresa May is trying to get Britain to accept the realities of belonging to the European Customs Union, which would preclude Britain having its own trade policy, uh, with our leaving the European Union's decision making body.

Speaker 3:          21:56          So essentially in that version, Brexit is just, uh, you have the responsibilities, you just don't have any power anymore. Uh, which is definitely not what the British public was told that it was getting in, in Brexit. Uh, the, the bigger problem in my mind is, is not one that, that we've discussed. And that is that all of this will end in tears to the point at which Jeremy Corbyn, the most left wing leader of the Labour party has ever had in its history, becomes prime minister because to Reesa Mae is leading the country towards this very unhappy compromise. At some point, the people who truly believe in Brexit, Jacob Riis smog, uh, for example, uh, perhaps Michael Gove, uh, they may decide we can't ultimately accept this and the government may fall. But the problem is that if the government falls, then Jeremy Corbyn has prime minister. If the government doesn't fall and we go all the way to the finishing line with this Theresa May version of Brexit, then I think the Conservatives will lose the next election in 2022, and Jeremy Corbyn will be prime minister.

Speaker 3:          23:01          So the worst there about Brexit is in my view, that if it is bungled in this way, it will open the door to a truly leftist government. And that will be far more economically damaging than anything Brexit has done. And that's the nightmare scenario for me and probably socially damaging and finger zillion other reasons deeply. We are, we should be extremely suspicious of Corban and his people. They are committed Marxists. They've been on the wrong side of every issue in my lifetime with a possible exception of South African apartheid. And I do not trust them with the keys to 10 Downing Street because I think that their ultimate agenda is a truly revolutionary one. Uh, and it poses a threat to the fundamental liberties, the traditions of the constitution. It's a dangerous, dangerous prospect. And I'm much more worried about Corban that about Brexit.

Speaker 2:          23:57          I mean, this is how I feel about what's happening with our left in America through that. You guys are giving us basically the precursor to this. I think

Speaker 3:          24:05          one of the lessons of history and now we can bring history in is that with populism, you, you get two flavors. In a typical backlash that would come after a financial crisis, uh, the political establishment discredited. There's a backlash against, uh, inequality, uh, all of the things that typically follow a financial crisis, but there are two possibilities. There's the populism of the left, which is the tax, the rich solution, but the populism of the writers more potent because it says that it's about immigration, it's about globalization, it's about free trade. And so broadly speaking, there's a very good study that shows this after big financial crises, the populace of the right do better because they offer a more plausible story. But if they don't deliver and they generally don't cause quite hard to make immigration control and terrorists pay quite hard actually to make your constituents better off with those policies, then the pendulum has a tendency to swing to the populism of the left. And that has happened in Britain really quick because Corbyn became popular very soon after Brexit. It's slower here, but the fear must be that if the Trump experiment goes as wrong as the vast majority of of intellectuals expect it to, the pendulum will swing to the left of the Democratic Party. And that scenario seems to me more and more plausible are, and I don't think that's a, that's a not an appetizing. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          25:40          I mean that, that, that's genuinely scary to me. But I want to back up for one second because the moment that you had that, you said a few times happened in these pubs when you would go there and people would say this about 1.3 million Muslims in Germany, how do you, so okay, so if you were listening to the mainstream media, they would say these people are all racist. That's what they would tell you. They're, they're racists and they're bigots. I suspect that's not what you think of these people. Although there probably was a certain amount of people that are just racist and don't like people of a different color or a different culture. How do you even have that conversation? Because that's what's so much of this is about, cause you, I'm sure it would have a pint with these people and you talk to them and realize that they weren't racist. They were actually just worried about their future, which is legit. But if you can't have that discussion because every time you open your mouth they tell you you're racist. Well then we know what you end up with. Look, I would be a very strange, if I took a bigger view on the subject because I'm an immigrant, I'm an factor about to become

Speaker 3:          26:44          an American citizen. Uh, in a matter of weeks. My wife was a refugee who go from, um, uh, Somali originally to the Netherlands by applying for asylum. Uh, and so we would be the last couple to take a kind of a bigoted view on the immigration issue because we are the grids. When I had conversations on this subject at the time of the Brexit referendum, I remember realizing that the opposition to immigration was not plausibly a racist because I remember somebody making the point that he was as worried about the people from Lithuania and Poland coming to Britain as he was about people from Syria and Iraq. And, uh, and you probably know that people from Poland Lithuania, a pretty white. So here's the thing, what we all need to recognize is that if immigration shoots up, if it grows from, in the case of Britain, 10,000 or 20,000 a year to 200,000 to 300,000 a year, perfectly unprejudiced people will say, that's too much.

Speaker 3:          28:06          This is going too fast. And that I think was the dominant argument. Of course there are people who are racists in any society, but the striking thing about Britain is actually that it's not a terribly racist place. Did you see many people protesting against Prince Harry's decision to marry an American of mixed mixed race? I was there a couple of days before the Bolivarian. There were huge crowds. Uh, this matches extraordinary popular with ordinary people. So I think it's hard to argue that racism played any meaningful part are the white supremacist elements in Britain is really, is really very insignificant. And actually one of the ways in which the British like to define themselves is as being tolerant, uh, memories of the war of not entirely faded, even as the wartime generation gradually disappears from the scene. What was the war against Germany? About it was a war against the ultimate racist state.

Speaker 3:          29:11          What hurt Jeremy Corban the most in the last three or four months? The evidence that there are antisemitic elements within his faction of the Labor left that hurt him. And it's important that that argument keep being made because it has real truth to it. And I think ordinary people think that's not good. So I, I think this is not really about racism. It's not about bigotry. It's about how rapidly should immigration occur, how large should flows be across borders. And the lesson of history is that if you allow a real surge in immigration, there will be a populist backlash against is what happened in the United States in the late 19th century. The peak in the 1880s the foreign born percentage of the population in the US was about 14% and gone up from relatively low level, it's about 14% same thing has happened in our time.

Speaker 3:          30:04          It was down I think below 7% in the mid 20th century. In the period after World War II immigrants, we're a relatively small proportion. NATO foreign born citizens were pretty small portion of the US population. And then from the 1980s onwards, the proportion surged and the character of the immigrants changed, uh, that the places that they came from change. And these changes are bound to elicit a reaction. It always happens and it's not enough for people in the liberal elites who by and large don't live in areas where immigrants and come to say what a terrible deplorable bunch of chauvinists you are for not wanting for not wanting more immigrants. That's simply, that's simply historically stupid. Uh, and the other thing that stupid about this in the United States is, uh, the people on the left who want to legitimize illegal immigration. I think for many people who were attracted to Trump, the issue was the illegal quality of the immigration.

Speaker 3:          31:04          The rule of law is a big deal in the English speaking world. And people don't like to hear anything that simply says amnesty for lawbreakers. Well, if you're a law abiding citizen and you're suddenly told, well, yet the law applies to you, but there are these other people, it's not going to apply to you. Then your natural reaction is, screw this. That's why I thought one of his best lines, he doesn't use it as much anymore. But during the campaign where either a country or we're not, I thought was a really effective line. You either have laws or you don't. I mean, that in essence is the truth. So let, let's shift to Trump a little bit here. Um, I think that we're kind of in a similar spot with him, which is that it's better than the alternative. That that's certainly how I feel at this point, that all of the forces that we've spent the last hour plus talking about would be that much more emboldened against free thought and all and free expression and open inquiry and all the things that we care about and historical fact and, and everything else.

Speaker 3:          32:05          If he was in president right now, I am deeply ambivalent about all of this. I think it's, it's very, very hard, uh, to say, uh, a good word about the personality of Donald Trump. I'm with you. I, it was a reason that I, I found it impossible to support him in 2016. I think one has to acknowledge that he has, uh, used inflammatory language, uh, on the issues we've talked about immigration, uh, that he has a record of, of, of lying, which is, uh, even by the standards of American presidents. Pretty remarkable. Uh, and so the familiar list of things about Donald Trump that most of my friends find objectionable is Kinda hard for me to, to dismiss. But I said I'm ambivalent for a reason. On the other hand, number one, what if he lost? I said this to Sam Harris a few weeks ago. Let's run the counter factual.

Speaker 3:          33:24          This is what historians should do. Let's imagine an alternative history. If Donald Trump had lost the election by let's say, the same narrow margin that he wanted it, how would all those people who voted for him have felt and how would they behaved? To my mind, the election of Donald Trump is a cathartic moment for those people so despised by the liberal elites that they could refer to them as deplorables. The people who voted for Donald Trump are not by and large are racists, are not by and large, uh, uh, anything like Donald Trump is personally. What attracted them to Trump were two things, which as with the Brexit campaign will legitimate number one, they were attracted to Trump's policy positions on trade, on immigration, on Islam, at and on, uh, the somewhat corrupt liberal elite that had been run in the country for the previous eight years. So I think they were attracted to Trump's policy positions, but they were also attracted to his cultural position.

Speaker 3:          34:38          And I think about half of American populism is cultural. What attracted the friends I have who supported Trump to Trump was his fundamental shift in language, away from the politically correct talking points of the political class, Republicans and Democrats alike to a demotic normal way of speaking, such as you would here in the typical American bar, more or less anywhere in the country except Cambridge, Massachusetts, Stanford, California, and the rest. Now I, I remember thinking on the eve of the election, if you line up all the people who are going to vote for her and you line up all the people who are going to vote for him, which line would you rather be in? Remember at that point, I'm not a citizen. I don't have a vote, and I thought that's easy. I'm with the people who are so pissed with the political establishment that they're ready to take a chance on this guy because they see no other way to shake things up the way.

Speaker 3:          35:38          My friend Jerry Blake put it to me, Ex Marine Corps Xn YPD never went to college, helps take care of my wife's security. Jerry said to me early 2016 two things that stuck in my mind for us. He told me Trump was going to win, but then he said the two reasons why he supported Trump. Number One, he tells it like it is. Number two, he's going to shake things up by, he tells it like it is. Jared did not mean he is always truthful. What he meant was he talks like me by shaking things up, Jerry men, we have to do something because the system as it stands is not in my interests. It's not in my interests economically because it seems to favor China over the United States, Mexicans, overt, native born Americans, the rich 1% over me, the median household. But he's also, it's also about this cultural reaction against the multiculturalism that has become the orthodoxy of the liberal left.

Speaker 3:          36:40          So for all my reservations about Trump, I completely got why people voted for him. And I think their reaction had he lost would have been toxic. I don't think they would have accepted the legitimacy of the result. I think they would have bought the story. Trump would have told them that the election had been rigged, and I think we would've had a poisoned body politic from day one of a Clinton presidency. If it all ends, oddly though we're having that right now, just in the reverse, right. It would have been worse, but we're having a left that's not accepting the legitimacy of the election, and I think it would have been worse. Yeah, I think it would've been worse. Uh, and I think, and this is another part of the story that for Jerian his and his many, many fellow Americans who voted Trump, this has always been a gamble and they've always had a sense that it could go wrong.

Speaker 3:          37:37          You know, when you shake things up, sometimes they break. And I s I sense that if it all ends in fiasco, which I guess that the vast majority of public intellectuals expect, and some combination of Watergate and other scandals, I think Jerry and his and his fellow American Trump supporters will say, well, we gave it a try. Give it a try. And I think that's, that's one possible scenario. The other reason that I am ambivalent about Trump is that for all his flaws, in some ways he's doing a better job, uh, on foreign policy than his predecessor did. Uh, because Trump has this superpower that most intellectuals can't understand, he has an unerring instinct for the weakness of the counterparty that it's a kind of, almost animal instinct. But some are Donald Trump can tell when the other side is weak. You could see it in Jeb Bush, she could see it in Marco Rubio, could see it in Hillary Clinton.

Speaker 3:          38:31          And now I think he sees it in the Europeans. He sees in Angola Merkel, you don't pay enough for your defense. What if I walk out on NATO? Yeah, well there's a season interview Kim Jong than he sees it in Xi Jinping. He sees it in the, uh, in the supreme leader in Neuron. So my ambivalence is partly by sympathy for Trump supporters. My fundamental sense of why they voted for him. But it's also that in some ways, this disruption has its plus side in the way that it's repositioning the United States. I mean, I, to me, it's given oxygen to everything that we've talked about here. And that doesn't, that doesn't discount all of the legitimate concerns that you look. The big concern for me, as I mentioned before, is that the pendulum swings the other way. If this all ends in tears, all of those who defended it, even if they defended it half hearted, they like me, will be discredited.

Speaker 3:          39:27          And the damage will be irreparable, uh, for conservatives and populists alike. The left we empowered and they will spend the rest of our lives telling us that we were apologists for the worst president. And that's, that's not a scenario that you can discount likely for a time. I think it was exhilarating, are freely admit that for me, one of the most satisfying aspects of Trump's victory was that all the people I most dislike in this contract, we're in a state of hysteria and shock for weeks. And I remember things that are, you know, it can't be all bad if the people I really can't stand or in this state, but you have to, I think with history in mind, be conscious of the dangers of the fact that this could end so badly that it does irreparable damage. And, and the worst damage of all will be if it propels the left of the Democratic Party into power.

Speaker 3:          40:28          And that, that you can't rule out, you call. The worst thing about studying history is that it makes you aware of how under terministic their historical processes, that there is always more than one future. There's the future of triumph. There's the future of tragedy. And there's this kind of other future in the middle, which is a little bit of both. And that's really one of the historical moment is bad for restful sleep on wakes up in the morning. And I'm sure you have the same feeling wondering what alert will be on your phone and what message will be on your phone. Will the alerts say war has broken out? Will the alerts say are palace coup and will the message say, uh, you'll reputation has just been, uh, been destroyed by some accusation or other. So one wakes up in a state of anxiety in the United States of, of 2018. And that is a, is a reality for that I think is inherent. Both

Speaker 2:          41:33          the culture war that we've spoken about and the Trump presidency, which is in some measure a backlash against that, that culture war. We're going to leave it at that, but I am going to demand that you come back. I don't think I've ever demanded that. I guess come back and ask, but I'm legitimately demanding that you come back. Because next time I want to do, I want to just do all history and we can even break even out even barely jump into, I want him to even some prior stuff and Churchill and okay, I'm demanding it. Will you accept my demand? Except all right, it took a long time to get here but, but considering we're both two guys just off planes today and you're like 87 hours out of whack and jet lag and all those things we said we'll be taken out of context on Twitter. Well high gusts sincerely hope everything because that's how you know the whole thing goes. This has truly, truly been an absolute pleasure and thank you for doing this and send my best of course, Diane. Sure will. And uh, for more on Neil, you can follow him on the Twitter, although you don't fight with people that much on Twitter, which means, which means you have strong moral character.
