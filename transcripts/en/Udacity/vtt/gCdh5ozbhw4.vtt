00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:04.512
So here's the answer. Initially we create a restaurant object and we see that it

00:00:04.512 --> 00:00:08.578
has the is yummy method we defined that always returns false. But is yummy is

00:00:08.578 --> 00:00:12.551
just an attribute we can assign that to something else. So let's create a new

00:00:12.551 --> 00:00:17.280
function we'll call it real yummy that always returns true. And just to test it

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:21.643
really yummy returns true. So now what we really want to do is replace. The

00:00:21.643 --> 00:00:28.580
value of the is yummy attribute of chez bananas with really yummy. And now when

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:32.734
we call this procedure well we're just calling the really yummy procedure

00:00:32.734 --> 00:00:36.845
redefined. It always returns true. Note that there is a difference here. The is

00:00:36.845 --> 00:00:42.081
yummy is a method and that implicitly is bound to this chez bananas object. The

00:00:42.081 --> 00:00:47.163
really yummy takes no parameters, it's not a method, it's just a procedure that

00:00:47.163 --> 00:00:51.180
always returns true. And I should have a very clear warning. Although we can do

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.788
this, it's really confusing. So please don't do this, don't reassign methods to

00:00:55.788 --> 00:01:00.415
new values unless you've got a really, really good reason. And if you've got a

00:01:00.415 --> 00:01:03.895
really good reason for wanting to do this kind of change, post it on the

00:01:03.895 --> 00:01:07.615
discussion forums, and make sure that people agree that it's a really good

00:01:07.615 --> 00:01:09.273
reason. There probably isn't one.
