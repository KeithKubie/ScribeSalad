00:00:01.601 --> 00:00:04.103
More disappointing behavior
yesterday coming

00:00:04.136 --> 00:00:07.974
from America's least profitable
investment-- our schools.

00:00:08.007 --> 00:00:10.176 line:0%
An estimated one million
students took part

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:13.179 line:0%
in Wednesday's national school
walkout against gun violence.

00:00:13.212 --> 00:00:15.381 line:0%
They mobilized at schools
from coast to coast,

00:00:15.414 --> 00:00:17.750 line:0%
<i> demanding that Congress
 and state lawmakers do more</i>

00:00:17.783 --> 00:00:19.786 line:0%
<i> -to restrict access to guns.</i>
 -(indistinct chanting)

00:00:19.819 --> 00:00:23.356
Oh, now you're making demands,
huh, kids? What's next?

00:00:23.389 --> 00:00:26.192
We all have to eat sloppy joes
for lunch every day?

00:00:26.225 --> 00:00:27.593
I'm a grown up.

00:00:27.626 --> 00:00:31.130
I eat clean, tidy josephs.

00:00:31.163 --> 00:00:34.233
Frankly, I tried to ignore
all these protests,

00:00:34.266 --> 00:00:36.402
which is why I was reassured
when I tuned into Infowars

00:00:36.435 --> 00:00:38.037
and saw Scott Adams--

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.040
yes,<i> Dilbert</i> cartoonist,
Scott Adams--

00:00:41.073 --> 00:00:44.811
explain why these students
deserve to be ignored.

00:00:44.844 --> 00:00:47.413
There are very few people
among the young

00:00:47.446 --> 00:00:49.315
who are leaving school today,

00:00:49.348 --> 00:00:51.217
who would actually even claim

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:53.886
<i> to having a good knowledge</i>

00:00:53.919 --> 00:00:55.721
<i> of the entire gun debate,</i>

00:00:55.754 --> 00:00:57.523
<i> you know,
 all of the elements of it,</i>

00:00:57.556 --> 00:01:00.359
<i> enough to really have a,
 you know, a reasoned opinion.</i>

00:01:00.392 --> 00:01:02.128
<i> The people who were doing
 the protesting</i>

00:01:02.161 --> 00:01:04.297
<i> are the dumbest members
 of society.</i>

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.100
Yes. Scott Adams knows dumb
when he sees it.

00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:09.068
He spent 28 years drawing a guy

00:01:09.101 --> 00:01:11.871
who can't iron his (bleep) tie.

00:01:11.904 --> 00:01:14.540
Now, Adams made
an excellent point,

00:01:14.573 --> 00:01:17.743
which is that gun control
is a nuanced, complex debate,

00:01:17.776 --> 00:01:20.413
and these kids aren't nearly
knowledgeable enough to know

00:01:20.446 --> 00:01:22.782
that they don't want
to be shot.

00:01:22.815 --> 00:01:25.685
They're just too dumb
to weigh-in.

00:01:25.718 --> 00:01:27.720
That's why you need an expert.

00:01:27.753 --> 00:01:30.490
And what do experts say
when it comes to gun control?

00:01:30.523 --> 00:01:32.492
They almost universally
push the narrative

00:01:32.525 --> 00:01:34.227
that gun control saves lives,

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.230
which is why
we can't trust experts.

00:01:38.564 --> 00:01:40.800
Okay, so you can't trust kids,

00:01:40.833 --> 00:01:42.735
and you can't trust experts.

00:01:42.768 --> 00:01:45.004
'Cause kids are too dumb.

00:01:45.037 --> 00:01:47.940
Experts are too elitist.

00:01:47.973 --> 00:01:50.243
So who can you trust?

00:01:50.276 --> 00:01:53.646
The middle.

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:56.716
A confident
television personality

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:59.886
with great hair and
a limited frame of reference,

00:01:59.919 --> 00:02:02.221
just like Laura Ingraham.

00:02:02.254 --> 00:02:04.423 line:0%
We're talking
about students here.

00:02:04.456 --> 00:02:06.959 line:0%
And for anyone who takes
the time to look

00:02:06.992 --> 00:02:08.728 line:0%
at our academic standing
in the world,

00:02:08.761 --> 00:02:12.165 line:0%
students need more academics,
more classroom time,

00:02:12.198 --> 00:02:13.933 line:0%
not more hysterics.

00:02:13.966 --> 00:02:15.234
Exactly, Laura.

00:02:15.267 --> 00:02:16.969
That's why the U.S.
is trailing in academics.

00:02:17.002 --> 00:02:18.504
The kids keep walking out

00:02:18.537 --> 00:02:20.039
to protest
every school shooting,

00:02:20.072 --> 00:02:22.942
so they're never in school.

00:02:22.975 --> 00:02:25.278
And teachers don't have time
to catch them up,

00:02:25.311 --> 00:02:29.081
because the president sent them
all off to target practice.

00:02:29.114 --> 00:02:31.918
The bottom line is,
true patriots understand

00:02:31.951 --> 00:02:35.955
that if you want to protest,
there's only one right way.

00:02:35.988 --> 00:02:37.957 line:0%
TIM:
<i> Our parochial school teachers</i>

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:39.926 line:0%
<i> worked with the students
 and put together</i>

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:42.295 line:0%
<i> a pro-program of a walk-in.</i>

00:02:42.328 --> 00:02:44.931 line:0%
<i> And they went into the churches
 and auditoriums,</i>

00:02:44.964 --> 00:02:49.101 line:0%
<i> and recognized, um,
 the victims with prayer.</i>

00:02:49.134 --> 00:02:51.204 line:0%
I really like that.
Think about that.

00:02:51.237 --> 00:02:54.073 line:0%
Commemorating the lost,
remembering the victims.

00:02:54.106 --> 00:02:56.976 line:0%
Prayer offered as a class.

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:59.979 line:0%
To me, that makes a lot more
sense than yelling into

00:03:00.012 --> 00:03:02.682 line:0%
a microphone in front
of some government building.

00:03:02.715 --> 00:03:04.317
Yeah, she's right.

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:07.486
Yelling into a microphone
outside of a government building

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:09.855
never affects government change.

00:03:09.888 --> 00:03:11.958
Take it from me
and my wheelbarrow

00:03:11.991 --> 00:03:14.427
of parking tickets.

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:17.396
Sure, if you want to raise
a stink about something,

00:03:17.429 --> 00:03:19.632
you could dominate a full day
of cable news coverage

00:03:19.665 --> 00:03:21.634
with a nationwide protest.

00:03:21.667 --> 00:03:24.737
Or you could quietly whisper
your hopes and dreams

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:27.273
into your closed palms,
where only Jesus can hear them.
