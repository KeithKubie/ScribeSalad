00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:04.090
One more thing you may be wondering is,
how does the term Data Analysis relate

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:07.730
to similar terms like Data Science,
Data Engineering or Big Data?

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.639
First, Data Science is very
similar to Data Analysis.

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:16.000
In fact, many people might describe
some of the examples I gave near

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.410
the beginning of the lesson,

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:20.190
such as Netflix's movie
recommendations as data science.

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:23.920
I often hear people use the terms,
data analysis and

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.380
data science interchangeably.

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.860
However, to the extent that
there is a difference.

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:31.730
In my experience data science
is a little more likely to refer

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.970
to building some sort of a system,
like a recommendation system, or

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:36.340
a ranking algorithm.

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:37.580
While a blog post or

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:40.910
a paper is more likely to be
refered to as data analysis.

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:42.550
It's definitely a fuzzy line though.

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.630
If you hear some advice for a data
scientists, it's probably relevant for

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:46.670
a data analyst as well.

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:51.400
In terms of job postings, a data
scientist title sometimes requires more

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.740
experience than a data analyst title.

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:55.390
Although of course
this varies by company.

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:59.330
Data engineers are more focused
on the data wrangling step of

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.560
the data analysis process.

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.849
They make data pipelines and insure that
data collection is fault tolerant and

00:01:04.849 --> 00:01:06.310
scales well.

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.110
They're more involved in storing and
processing data, and

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.370
less involved in drawing
conclusions based on the data.

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:15.750
Big data is a fuzzy term that refers
to the fact that many companies

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.420
today are dealing with a lot of data,
terabytes, petabytes, and more.

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.240
There's no rule for how much data you
need before it is big, but certainly

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.240
the amount of data we have today
seems big compared to ten years ago.

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.430
Data analysts, data scientists, and

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.780
data engineers can all work with
either big data or not so big data.
