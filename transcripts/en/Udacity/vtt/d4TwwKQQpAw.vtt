00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.980
So we just established that alcohol was a drug that can build up in the body,

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:10.630
and exert intoxicating effects, but how does it do this? Well, alcohol

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:15.530
has specific targets, for example the neurotransmitter

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:18.320
GABA receptors, are really important in the

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.670
brain and central nervous system. Alcohol can

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:25.380
physically bind to the GABA receptor and

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.210
enhance its function in signaling inside the

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:32.240
cell. This is referred to as pharmacodynamics,

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:36.843
what a drug does to a body. The direct targets, the target effects of the

00:00:36.843 --> 00:00:39.660
drug. The physical binding of alcohol to

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.940
the GABA receptor. Activates this neurotransmitter pathway,

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.160
which results in relaxation, and slower reaction

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.390
times. So based on this information, which of

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.630
the following mutations of the GABA receptor do you

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:56.240
think would result in a pharmacodynamic change were the

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:01.310
person would experience increased relaxation and slower reaction times?

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:03.210
Go ahead and pick which answer you think is best.
