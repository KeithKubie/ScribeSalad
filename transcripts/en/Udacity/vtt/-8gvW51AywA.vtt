00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:02.750
All right, so where should we add diff?

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:06.600
Diff is clearly related to both Git and commit, and, and

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.650
also to version control more indirectly.

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:13.230
But like we said, we don't want to add all these second-order connections, so

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.220
let's just connect it with commit.

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:19.017
The relationship between diff and commit isn't really type-of or

00:00:19.017 --> 00:00:21.450
part-of, so we'll need a new color for it.

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:23.050
Since diff takes two commits and

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:26.900
compares them, we're going to call this the operates-on relationship.
