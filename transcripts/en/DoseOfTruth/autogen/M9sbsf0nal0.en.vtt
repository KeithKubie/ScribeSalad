okay so that's another issue that I'd

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:02.040
okay so that's another issue that I'd
 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.649
okay so that's another issue that I'd
like to bring up because one of the

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:03.659
like to bring up because one of the
 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:05.990
like to bring up because one of the
things I cannot figure out is the

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000
things I cannot figure out is the
 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.360
things I cannot figure out is the
alliance between the post modernists and

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370
alliance between the post modernists and
 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.879
alliance between the post modernists and
the neo-marxists I can't understand the

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889
the neo-marxists I can't understand the
 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.480
the neo-marxists I can't understand the
causal relationship there because that

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:13.490
causal relationship there because that
 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:16.010
causal relationship there because that
tell me if you disagree with this okay

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020
tell me if you disagree with this okay
 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.320
tell me if you disagree with this okay
because I'm a psychologist not a

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330
because I'm a psychologist not a
 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.179
because I'm a psychologist not a
sociologist and so I'm dabbling in

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189
sociologist and so I'm dabbling in
 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:21.769
sociologist and so I'm dabbling in
things that are outside of my field of

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779
things that are outside of my field of
 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.300
things that are outside of my field of
expertise and there is some danger in

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310
expertise and there is some danger in
 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.519
expertise and there is some danger in
that but the center the central post

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529
that but the center the central post
 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.500
that but the center the central post
modernist claim seems to me that because

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510
modernist claim seems to me that because
 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.810
modernist claim seems to me that because
there's a near infinite number of ways

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820
there's a near infinite number of ways
 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.209
there's a near infinite number of ways
to interpret a complex set of phenomena

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219
to interpret a complex set of phenomena
 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.010
to interpret a complex set of phenomena
which which actually happens to be the

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020
which which actually happens to be the
 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.889
which which actually happens to be the
case that you can't make a case that any

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899
case that you can't make a case that any
 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.720
case that you can't make a case that any
of those modes of interpretation are

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730
of those modes of interpretation are
 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.310
of those modes of interpretation are
canonical and so if they're not

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320
canonical and so if they're not
 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.700
canonical and so if they're not
canonical if that and if that canonical

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710
canonical if that and if that canonical
 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.170
canonical if that and if that canonical
element isn't based in some kind of

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180
element isn't based in some kind of
 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.240
element isn't based in some kind of
reality then it serves some other master

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250
reality then it serves some other master
 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.369
reality then it serves some other master
and so the master that it hypothetically

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379
and so the master that it hypothetically
 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:50.900
and so the master that it hypothetically
serves for the post modernists is

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910
serves for the post modernists is
 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.790
serves for the post modernists is
nothing but power because that seems to

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800
nothing but power because that seems to
 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.410
nothing but power because that seems to
be everything that they believe in they

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420
be everything that they believe in they
 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.150
be everything that they believe in they
don't believe in competence they don't

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160
don't believe in competence they don't
 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.979
don't believe in competence they don't
believe in Authority they don't seem to

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989
believe in Authority they don't seem to
 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.630
believe in Authority they don't seem to
believe in an objective world because

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640
believe in an objective world because
 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.119
believe in an objective world because
everything is language mediated so it's

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129
everything is language mediated so it's
 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.609
everything is language mediated so it's
an extraordinarily cynical perspective

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619
an extraordinarily cynical perspective
 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.590
an extraordinarily cynical perspective
that that because there's an infinite

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600
that that because there's an infinite
 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.539
that that because there's an infinite
number of interpretations none of them

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549
number of interpretations none of them
 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:09.980
number of interpretations none of them
are canonical you can attribute it

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990
are canonical you can attribute it
 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.230
are canonical you can attribute it
everything to power and dominance okay

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240
everything to power and dominance okay
 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.670
everything to power and dominance okay
so that does that seem like a reasonable

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680
so that does that seem like a reasonable
 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.679
so that does that seem like a reasonable
summary of the okay it's a radical

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689
summary of the okay it's a radical
 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.630
summary of the okay it's a radical
relativism now but the strange thing is

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640
relativism now but the strange thing is
 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.880
relativism now but the strange thing is
despite okay and so what goes along with

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890
despite okay and so what goes along with
 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.440
despite okay and so what goes along with
that is the demolition of grand

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450
that is the demolition of grand
 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.940
that is the demolition of grand
narratives and so that would be

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950
narratives and so that would be
 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.469
narratives and so that would be
associated for example with the

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479
associated for example with the
 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.450
associated for example with the
rejection of thinkers like Jung and Eric

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460
rejection of thinkers like Jung and Eric
 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.830
rejection of thinkers like Jung and Eric
Norman because of course they're

foundational thinkers in relationship to

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200
foundational thinkers in relationship to
 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.770
foundational thinkers in relationship to
the idea that there are embodied grand

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780
the idea that there are embodied grand
 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.170
the idea that there are embodied grand
narratives that's never touched but then

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180
narratives that's never touched but then
 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.179
narratives that's never touched but then
despite the fact that the grand

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189
despite the fact that the grand
 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:42.950
despite the fact that the grand
narrative is rejected there's a neo

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960
narrative is rejected there's a neo
 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.289
narrative is rejected there's a neo
Marxism that's tightly tightly allied

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299
Marxism that's tightly tightly allied
 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.179
Marxism that's tightly tightly allied
with post-modernism that also seems to

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189
with post-modernism that also seems to
 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:48.800
with post-modernism that also seems to
shade into this strange identity

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810
shade into this strange identity
 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.950
shade into this strange identity

for the continuation of the kind of

pathological Marxism that produced the
