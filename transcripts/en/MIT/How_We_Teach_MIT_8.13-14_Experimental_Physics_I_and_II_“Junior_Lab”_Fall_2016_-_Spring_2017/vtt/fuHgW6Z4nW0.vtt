JANET CONRAD: So I think
that one of the hardest

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:10.780
things about Junior Lab is
that you're asking students

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:13.960
to do something that they
really have not done before.

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:16.149
They have not,
for the most part,

00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:18.520
there are a few that
will have actually worked

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.120
as what we call UROPs,
undergraduate researchers.

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.990
But for the most part, most of
them have not been on their own

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:30.130
independently working in a lab,
where they have to figure out

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:31.400
what are their goals?

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:36.010
They have to figure out
what is the outcome that

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:40.420
is going to be good
enough, and so forth.

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.790
So there's a couple of
things that they learn

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:46.150
over the arc of the semester.

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:50.170
So one of them is how
to actually budget

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.010
your time so that you can
actually get a paper out.

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.380
Papers don't actually end.

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:57.005
They just stop.

00:00:57.005 --> 00:00:59.296
You know, there reaches a
point where you're just like,

00:00:59.296 --> 00:00:59.990
OK, I'm done.

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.910
And I'm going to stop.

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:02.784
And learning how to do
that is something that

00:01:02.784 --> 00:01:05.120
just takes a lot of practice.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.892
So there is that.

00:01:06.892 --> 00:01:08.350
Then they're actually
also learning

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.200
a set of practical skills that
I definitely see evolution

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.400
on over the semester.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.430
So especially with
error analysis,

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:18.700
they really improve
after lab one.

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.940
So they will have done the lab
0, which is the set of three.

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.680
And those, they are walked
through rather closely.

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.600
Then, they're on
their own on lab one,

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.147
and the errors analysis is
always really interesting.

00:01:32.147 --> 00:01:33.730
And then we work on
that a little bit,

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:36.070
and you find that they get
much more sophisticated

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:37.079
about error analysis.

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.620
And the very best
ones start learning

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:40.690
all kinds of things
about error analysis

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:44.020
that are not just
the standard things.

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.030
I had a student
this semester who

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:47.680
was very excited
about learning what

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.250
called the delta chi squared
method, which is where you have

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.350
a model, and you
change your model

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.590
so it introduces some
extra parameters.

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.500
And you look at how
much of a change of chi

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.470
squared you get, given the
change of degrees of freedom

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.170
that you just introduced, to
see if that model is a better

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.250
model than the one
you had before.

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.639
And so they become much
more sophisticated,

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:11.050
and that kind of thing.

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.220
They also become much more
relaxed with the equipment.

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.830
They understand how
the equipment works.

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.460
Usually by a lab two,
somebody has broken something

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:24.390
and discovered that it didn't
really mean the world ended.

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.830
It was OK.

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.920
So they are more willing to
actually be more adventurous,

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.730
and just come in and set
things up, and so forth.

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.940
And also, they will have gotten
into the groove with their lab

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:38.120
partner.

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.572
And that's an
important point also.

00:02:40.572 --> 00:02:43.030
Most of the time, they don't
seem to know their lab partner

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:44.740
before they get started.

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:49.390
And so figuring out what each
other's better skills are,

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:51.610
and how you play
them to advantage,

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:54.329
is an important
thing for them to do.

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:55.870
And it's important
in real life, too.

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.530
Most physicists work in
small collaborations, or even

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.030
big collaborations.

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:02.691
So being able to
work with somebody

00:03:02.691 --> 00:03:04.690
and figure out how to
bring the best out of them

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.020
is a very important thing.
