JON WILEY: Hello.

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:09.875
Welcome to "Designing
for Virtual Reality."

00:00:09.875 --> 00:00:10.750
My name's John Wiley.

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:12.708
I'm the principal designer
for Google Cardboard

00:00:12.708 --> 00:00:15.951
and Virtual Reality at Google.

00:00:15.951 --> 00:00:17.450
Everybody enjoying
their Cardboards?

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:19.760
Hopefully most of you got some?

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.300
I think we ran out, so
they were pretty popular.

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:23.420
Awesome.

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:25.380
Also, I recommend, if
you haven't already,

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.420
after this, go up and
check out our demo booth.

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:31.450
The jump videos there
are exceptional.

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:33.010
Yesterday, we
actually had the guy

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.330
who drove the
actual Rover on Mars

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:39.610
was giving the expedition
on Cardboard for the Mars

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:42.425
expedition, so that was
actually really exciting.

00:00:42.425 --> 00:00:42.925
Cool.

00:00:42.925 --> 00:00:43.520
Well, welcome.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.267
Thanks for coming today.

00:00:46.267 --> 00:00:48.350
Today, we're going to talk
a little bit about what

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.270
our team has learned
in the short time

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:52.320
that we've been
working on Cardboard.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.830
So we released Cardboard
about a year ago,

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:58.690
and the momentum
has been tremendous.

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:00.420
It actually really surprised us.

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.270
It went from being this 20%
thing that was like, oh, that's

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.120
kind of cool, to just having
a lot of excitement around it,

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.610
a lot of apps being built,
and a lot of Cardboard devices

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.330
out in the world, and
just tremendous growth,

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.230
and that's really
exciting to see.

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:19.600
Last year, I was at I/O here
to present material design.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.210
And one of the things
that attracted me

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.610
to Cardboard and to VR, if
you think about material

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.030
design, its origins
are in the fact

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.270
that you're physically
interacting with software.

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.860
So the way in which
you respond to it,

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.780
you're touching
a physical device

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.530
and you're actually
touching the software,

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.020
and in that, you kind want
to have the software have

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.961
some authenticity, right?

00:01:45.961 --> 00:01:47.460
It's going to be
responsive and it's

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:53.170
going to have some physics,
and motion is a first priority

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:54.650
citizen there.

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:56.610
You want to be true
to that interaction.

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.580
And the cool thing about that
is that every single time

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:04.590
that computing gets closer to
the way in which we naturally

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.120
interact with the world,
that's where the magic happens.

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:10.199
Well, virtual
reality is 10x that.

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:12.630
It's really tapping
directly into the way

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.740
we perceive and see the world.

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:16.300
If you can get one
of these demos,

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.900
and again, those jump videos,
you have to see them in VR.

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.202
That's really
where the magic is.

00:02:22.202 --> 00:02:23.910
Near things are near,
far things are far,

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.910
and it's really tapping
into that authenticity

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:29.820
of the physical space.

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.670
And we really feel like
in terms of creating

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.200
delightful experiences, that's
really where the magic is.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.070
When computing gets
closer to the way

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.110
that humans naturally
interact with the world,

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:43.720
that's where great
things can happen.

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.732
But the inverse is also true.

00:02:45.732 --> 00:02:48.960
We raised the stakes in terms
of people's expectations.

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:53.850
We expect reality to not drop
frames, and virtual reality,

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:55.350
if we really want
it to be immersive

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.060
and have a great
experience, we want

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.935
to make sure that we're
doing the right thing

00:02:58.935 --> 00:03:01.000
and we're feeding into
people's expectations

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.350
about turning around and seeing
things and how that works.

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.980
And so it's easy
to fall into a pit

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.244
where actually, you can
create a bad experience,

00:03:09.244 --> 00:03:10.910
just as much as it
is possible to create

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:12.564
an amazing experience.

00:03:12.564 --> 00:03:14.230
And we've been thinking
about that a lot

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.766
since we started
working on Cardboard,

00:03:16.766 --> 00:03:19.586
and we're actually really
excited about the momentum

00:03:19.586 --> 00:03:21.710
across the entire industry
and lots of conversation

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:24.090
about how to design
great experiences.

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.482
And today, we're going to
share what excites us about VR,

00:03:26.482 --> 00:03:28.337
and we're also
going to share what

00:03:28.337 --> 00:03:30.920
we've learned in the short time
that we've been working on it,

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.420
and we hope to continue
this conversation

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.100
beyond these walls.

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.434
So with that, please
welcome Erica.

00:03:37.434 --> 00:03:40.278
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:42.894 --> 00:03:43.560
ERICA MORSE: Hi.

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:44.226
My name's Erica.

00:03:44.226 --> 00:03:45.770
I'm a designer on
the Cardboard team,

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:47.436
and today I'm going
to be talking to you

00:03:47.436 --> 00:03:49.115
about why virtual reality.

00:03:52.059 --> 00:03:53.600
With virtual reality,
you give people

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:55.887
one of the most popular
superpowers, teleportation.

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:00.980
Imagine your third
grade self learning

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:03.770
about the Mayan civilization
for the first time,

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:05.830
but instead of
looking at a textbook,

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:08.596
you're standing at the
base of Chichen Itza.

00:04:08.596 --> 00:04:10.470
This is actually imagery
from the expeditions

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.670
that we announced at
yesterday's keynote.

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:15.240
Soon, teachers will actually
be able to take their students

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:17.660
on virtual tours
around these ruins.

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:22.490
Think about how much more
fun school is going to be.

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:25.370
VR also allows for more
engaging journalism.

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:27.790
Instead of reading about the
earthquake in Nepal, what

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:29.240
if you could go
there and see what

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.530
it's like firsthand
on the ground?

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:33.830
Think about the empathy
and sense of civic duty

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:36.670
this could inspire.

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:38.780
And finally, how
about the art world?

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:41.800
Installations that play
with space, light, and color

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.900
can only be fully appreciated
in person, or now,

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:46.740
in virtual reality.

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:49.800
So you can transport your users.

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.510
You can also give
them experiences

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:56.010
that are physically
impossible in the real world.

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:01.710
How about flying, another
popular superpower?

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:04.570
In a Cardboard app
called Caaaaardboard!--

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:07.030
it has five A's and
one exclamation point--

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:09.260
players get to dive
off of buildings,

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.450
and that feeling of falling
continuously is an experience

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:15.750
you can't easily
get in real life.

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:20.650
So those are a few of the many
compelling use cases for VR.

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:22.620
What are you going to make?

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:24.400
I imagine that some
of you have ideas

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:26.589
for apps that will
live entirely in VR,

00:05:26.589 --> 00:05:28.380
but I'm guessing that
a large number of you

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:30.290
have existing 2D
apps that you're

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:32.016
thinking about adapting to VR.

00:05:32.016 --> 00:05:34.380
And to those folks,
my tip to you

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:37.110
is to start small and
focus on introducing

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:42.224
VR content that for your
app is a game changer.

00:05:42.224 --> 00:05:44.390
To give you a better idea
of what I'm talking about,

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:49.210
let's imagine I have a
hypothetical real estate app.

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:52.900
We have a Map view that allows
you to filter by location.

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:54.770
We have individual
listings with information

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:56.470
about price and size.

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:57.950
We even integrate
with Google Maps,

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:00.780
allowing you to easily get
locations to each house.

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:05.295
All of these tools are
working really well in 2D.

00:06:05.295 --> 00:06:07.420
But one part of the app
that would work much better

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:10.250
in virtual reality
is the photo gallery

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:13.510
because compared to
a series of photos,

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:16.150
touring in the home in VR will
give you a much better sense

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:17.752
of scale and layout.

00:06:17.752 --> 00:06:19.210
Also, think how
much time you could

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:22.245
save if you didn't have to
physically visit every house

00:06:22.245 --> 00:06:25.032
that you're interested in.

00:06:25.032 --> 00:06:26.865
Ask yourself if there's
any part of your app

00:06:26.865 --> 00:06:29.230
that is practically
begging to be displayed

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:32.570
in virtual reality, and if you
do decide to incorporate VR

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:37.830
into your app, here are some
best practice guidelines.

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:40.220
If you're using an icon to
represent Cardboard mode,

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:42.810
we suggest using the
silhouetted white icon

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:45.740
on the left instead of the
colored icon on the right.

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:47.720
The silhouetted icon
is simpler and it's

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:50.930
in keeping with the
Material Style Guide.

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:54.060
If instead you're using a
text button entry point,

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:56.152
say, something like View
in Cardboard or View

00:06:56.152 --> 00:06:58.240
in Virtual Reality,
using the word

00:06:58.240 --> 00:06:59.890
"cardboard" will
remind people what

00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:02.290
they should be reaching for.

00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:05.710
And finally, many of your users
won't have Cardboard, at least

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:07.910
yet, and for these
users, you might

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:10.480
consider hiding
the future entirely

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:12.380
or, if you want to
promote it, direct them

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:14.290
to the Google
Cardboard site where

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:17.370
they can learn what Cardboard
is and potentially get

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:18.500
a Cardboard of their own.

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:24.950
This concept of introducing
VR into 2D apps is still new,

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:28.460
but there are already a number
of apps that are doing it.

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:29.950
On the left,
there's Monzo, which

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:32.810
is an app that allows you to
create digital models of cars,

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:36.060
planes, even catapults,
and they added the ability

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:39.240
to view your final creations
in virtual reality.

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:40.720
And on the right
is Seene, which is

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:43.810
an app that allows you to
create and view 3D photos,

00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:46.280
and they also added
a Cardboard mode.

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:47.860
And most recently,
at the keynote

00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:50.980
yesterday, we announced
that YouTube will support

00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:52.725
Cardboard mode for 360 videos.

00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:59.080
In a year's time, over a million
people have gotten Cardboard,

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:01.910
and that number is getting
larger and larger, which

00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:05.190
means you have a growing
audience for the apps

00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:06.190
that you will dream up.

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:11.190
And as you start building
these VR experiences,

00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:13.857
it's important for you to
constantly test them out.

00:08:13.857 --> 00:08:15.940
I'd like to welcome Manuel,
who will tell you more

00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:18.656
about building VR experiences.

00:08:18.656 --> 00:08:21.644
[APPLAUSE]

00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:26.340
MANUEL CLEMENT: Thanks, Erica.

00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:26.940
OK.

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:29.170
Let's talk about crafting
your own applications.

00:08:29.170 --> 00:08:30.390
How many of you make stuff?

00:08:32.521 --> 00:08:34.729
I just want to make sure
I'm at the right conference.

00:08:38.409 --> 00:08:43.230
So when you build
applications in VR,

00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:46.740
it's very important that
you try them as early and as

00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:48.554
often as possible.

00:08:48.554 --> 00:08:50.470
It's kind of a temptation
to just throw things

00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:53.610
together and say it looks really
nice looking at your computer

00:08:53.610 --> 00:08:54.630
monitor.

00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:56.979
So something we think about
is the design process here,

00:08:56.979 --> 00:08:58.270
and we're just getting started.

00:08:58.270 --> 00:09:01.240
We want to share some ideas with
you, some things we explored.

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:04.420
Just remember to put it in
Cardboard, put it on eyes.

00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:07.450
As you place objects, say, wow,
this is too close, too far.

00:09:07.450 --> 00:09:08.870
We'll talk about it in a minute.

00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:13.030
So the goal here is to have
genuine empathy for your users.

00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:14.050
How do they feel?

00:09:14.050 --> 00:09:16.550
How does it really feel?

00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:20.457
So although this is about
prototyping and building stuff,

00:09:20.457 --> 00:09:21.790
we're building stuff for humans.

00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:24.520
Let's talk about humans.

00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:27.170
First, I'd like to
talk about convergence.

00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:29.970
Convergence is the
inward movement

00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:32.620
your eyes make toward
each other when

00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:36.590
you're trying to keep sharpness
in objects you're looking at.

00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:38.810
You might say it's focus.

00:09:38.810 --> 00:09:40.247
So a little experiment.

00:09:40.247 --> 00:09:41.580
Put your finger in front of you.

00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:43.370
Look at it.

00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:44.960
It's sharp.

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:49.837
And then you look at me or
at the stage, unsharp finger.

00:09:49.837 --> 00:09:50.670
You see two fingers.

00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:55.122
Next one.

00:09:55.122 --> 00:09:55.955
Is this comfortable?

00:09:55.955 --> 00:09:57.790
What do you think?

00:09:57.790 --> 00:10:00.430
So I did not experience this.

00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:02.940
I didn't get traumatized, but
let's try to traumatize you.

00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:06.650
Put your in front of you
and imagine it's a boulder,

00:10:06.650 --> 00:10:08.620
and then bring it
toward your face.

00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:10.080
Keep going, keep
going, keep going.

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:13.360
At one point, for
a regular human,

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:16.240
it will be blurry
no matter what.

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:18.540
Basically, things that are
too close to your head,

00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:21.480
you can't focus on it,
you can't converge on it.

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:26.900
It's something really
important to think about,

00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:30.627
and that's because your
eyes are basically crossing

00:10:30.627 --> 00:10:32.210
and you're straining
your eye muscles,

00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:34.110
so there's comfort
there as well,

00:10:34.110 --> 00:10:35.610
discomfort for your
users, something

00:10:35.610 --> 00:10:38.240
to really think
about display stuff.

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:40.260
A few more things
about convergence/focus

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:45.130
is people can only
focus on one thing

00:10:45.130 --> 00:10:48.760
at a time, a finger or myself.

00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:50.959
Also, switching
between distances.

00:10:50.959 --> 00:10:52.500
I'm looking at this
thing right here,

00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:54.412
and I'm looking at
people in the back,

00:10:54.412 --> 00:10:55.870
and I'm looking
here, and the back,

00:10:55.870 --> 00:10:58.012
and actually, the
thing is right here.

00:10:58.012 --> 00:10:59.720
If you do this
repeatedly, eventually, it

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:02.110
becomes uncomfortable, and
different people feel it

00:11:02.110 --> 00:11:04.840
differently, keep in mind.

00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:08.650
Additionally, people are
better at judging distances

00:11:08.650 --> 00:11:11.130
between objects that are up
close-- kind of makes sense,

00:11:11.130 --> 00:11:11.630
right?

00:11:11.630 --> 00:11:13.046
My hand's here or
my hand's here--

00:11:13.046 --> 00:11:18.560
than far away-- last
row, second to last.

00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:22.180
So the point here as you
build your applications

00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:24.840
is to always be aware of
what people's eyes have

00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:25.690
to converge on.

00:11:25.690 --> 00:11:28.760
That's a good way
to think about it.

00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:30.580
How does it relate
to you as developers?

00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:32.590
Well, it'll take you less time.

00:11:32.590 --> 00:11:33.950
You'll make less mistakes.

00:11:33.950 --> 00:11:37.030
You'll always try it and
say, are the eyes converging?

00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:38.450
Are people comfortable or not?

00:11:38.450 --> 00:11:41.660
So very useful for developers.

00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:43.704
So let's share some
prototypes with you.

00:11:43.704 --> 00:11:45.370
This is something we
tried a little bit,

00:11:45.370 --> 00:11:48.050
and I'm just sharing with
you the design process here.

00:11:48.050 --> 00:11:51.500
In this tool we prototyped,
we have these outside rings,

00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:57.300
and it presents you with a zone
of comfortable neutral/zero

00:11:57.300 --> 00:11:59.760
convergence for maximum comfort.

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:02.310
So you place objects
there and chances are,

00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:04.889
when people are focusing
back and forth in that area,

00:12:04.889 --> 00:12:05.930
they'll stay comfortable.

00:12:05.930 --> 00:12:07.720
So this was fun for us to try.

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:10.302
Additionally, when objects
are too close to you,

00:12:10.302 --> 00:12:11.760
it's going to zoom
in at one point,

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:14.740
there's a smaller
red ring, and so

00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:16.622
this was us checking things out.

00:12:16.622 --> 00:12:18.080
It's a good idea
to show the design

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:21.650
tool at what point things
are too close to the person.

00:12:21.650 --> 00:12:23.020
This is just sharing some ideas.

00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:24.920
We've learned a lot from this
prototype and other things

00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:25.586
we're exploring.

00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:29.380
Let's talk about scale.

00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:31.200
So in VR, scale
is very important,

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:35.590
something key to think about
as you build your experience.

00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:39.560
So there's something called
IPD, Inter-Pupillary Distance,

00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:42.610
and it's the distance
between your pupils.

00:12:42.610 --> 00:12:46.860
So something interesting
is an accurate IPD

00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:51.160
ensures people's sense of
scale matches their perception

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:53.900
of reality in the real world.

00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:57.490
That's like regular reality.

00:12:57.490 --> 00:12:58.950
But I could be giant.

00:12:58.950 --> 00:13:00.800
My head could be massive.

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:02.556
My IPD could be very wide.

00:13:02.556 --> 00:13:04.305
Also, it would mean
you guys of the world,

00:13:04.305 --> 00:13:07.970
if I had a really large head,
would appear really tiny,

00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:09.380
and that's really fun.

00:13:09.380 --> 00:13:10.740
So scale is fun.

00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:13.280
Have fun with it.

00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:15.040
To understand scale
better, something else

00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:17.670
we prototyped a bit is, what
if we dropped a human body

00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:19.200
inside a design tool?

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:21.330
And we found this is cool.

00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:24.750
Very quickly, I
can tell that wow,

00:13:24.750 --> 00:13:26.670
this is how big the
person is in the world.

00:13:26.670 --> 00:13:28.270
So we learned quite
a bit from that.

00:13:28.270 --> 00:13:30.560
It's fun to share with you.

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:33.766
Something else we found is that
standing and seated positions

00:13:33.766 --> 00:13:35.265
are pretty important
to think about.

00:13:35.265 --> 00:13:37.440
So if you stare at person,
it's like, we really

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:38.450
have a person there.

00:13:38.450 --> 00:13:42.020
It's not just for cylinders.

00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:43.930
So people may be
sitting in their living

00:13:43.930 --> 00:13:47.850
room, unable to turn around,
so you place stuff around them.

00:13:47.850 --> 00:13:49.820
Let's talk about
field of view now.

00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:53.160
So this prototype
shows two frustums.

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:54.910
Frustums are these
pyramid looking shapes.

00:13:54.910 --> 00:13:56.410
Sorry for the math
guys in the room.

00:13:56.410 --> 00:13:58.155
I've got to explain
it's like a pyramid.

00:13:58.155 --> 00:13:59.460
That's a frustum.

00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:02.100
So the narrower one
that you see right now

00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:04.390
shows you what you can see
without turning your head.

00:14:04.390 --> 00:14:05.720
So I think that in
there is pretty nice,

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:07.420
so you know when you
place an object there,

00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:09.586
as you move it into the
field of view of the person,

00:14:09.586 --> 00:14:11.980
is the person going to be
having to turn their head?

00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:15.729
You build UI, you have that
distance in the green rings,

00:14:15.729 --> 00:14:17.770
and then you know if they
have to turn their head

00:14:17.770 --> 00:14:21.210
to see anything or not.

00:14:21.210 --> 00:14:22.900
The wider one, the
black one there,

00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:25.880
shows you what you can see if
you turn your head slightly.

00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:27.020
It looks pretty wide.

00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:29.450
Actually, it's just turning
your head comfortably.

00:14:29.450 --> 00:14:31.120
So it's nice to think
about when people

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:34.650
are unable to turn around as
you build your interfaces.

00:14:34.650 --> 00:14:36.540
Just sharing with you
things we're trying.

00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:39.360
Hope that's
interesting to look at.

00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:43.020
Now let's talk about
the Cardboard Unity SDK.

00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:45.050
How many of you have
not used Unity yet,

00:14:45.050 --> 00:14:48.796
or are just kind of OK at Unity
and are just getting started?

00:14:48.796 --> 00:14:49.670
There's a lot of you.

00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:51.710
That's good.

00:14:51.710 --> 00:14:55.070
So I went to the Cardboard
website, downloaded this one

00:14:55.070 --> 00:14:58.270
file, and I'm importing into
an empty project in Unity.

00:15:00.950 --> 00:15:02.560
It has files in
it, lots of files.

00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:03.530
They're all very good.

00:15:03.530 --> 00:15:05.240
I'm going to highlight
three of them.

00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:07.520
There's a demo scene I'll
talk to you about a minute.

00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:09.230
There's a prefab
called CardboardMain,

00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:11.146
and prefabs are really
awesome for developers.

00:15:11.146 --> 00:15:13.930
It allows you to just drag
and drop into your scene,

00:15:13.930 --> 00:15:15.220
it's done, pretty much.

00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:17.860
You have that VR
rig ready to go.

00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:20.050
You've got the eyes set up.

00:15:20.050 --> 00:15:23.070
There's a C Sharp
script for when

00:15:23.070 --> 00:15:25.062
you guys want to build
your stuff from scratch.

00:15:25.062 --> 00:15:27.270
It allows you to drag and
drop to an existing camera.

00:15:27.270 --> 00:15:28.780
Maybe you have a
Unity app already,

00:15:28.780 --> 00:15:31.920
or maybe you're grabbing
one that you picked up

00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:33.610
and you want to port it to VR.

00:15:33.610 --> 00:15:36.930
It allows you to turn
the camera into a VR rig

00:15:36.930 --> 00:15:41.130
with just one
click, super useful.

00:15:41.130 --> 00:15:43.680
So fire up the demo
scene, this is what I see.

00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:45.980
So a lot of you haven't
used Unity much,

00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:48.940
so this scene is actually
a really nice first VR

00:15:48.940 --> 00:15:52.155
project as you're getting
started and once you get going.

00:15:52.155 --> 00:15:56.530
It has a bunch of interactions,
including this Gaze input

00:15:56.530 --> 00:15:59.680
thing we have going where
you see a reticle-- it's also

00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:01.700
called a dot-- in the
air, and it shows you

00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:02.780
what you're looking at.

00:16:02.780 --> 00:16:03.860
So that's built in.

00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:05.640
You just copy and
paste into your scenes

00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:09.870
and you've got stuff
running very quickly.

00:16:09.870 --> 00:16:12.110
So if I press Play in
Unity, it's really nice.

00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:12.610
It runs.

00:16:12.610 --> 00:16:15.630
I can see what it would
look like in Cardboard.

00:16:15.630 --> 00:16:17.630
I've got the eyes going.

00:16:17.630 --> 00:16:20.340
I'm turning my head by moving
the mouse while holding

00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:21.680
Alt, just a little tip.

00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:23.760
We documented that,
but it's good to know.

00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:28.180
And I click on these guys
by clicking on the mouse

00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:32.330
and it triggers the
button on the Cardboard.

00:16:32.330 --> 00:16:35.200
But you're looking at
a computer monitor now.

00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:37.460
Remember genuine
empathy for your users,

00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:39.300
like how does it really feel?

00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:42.567
So wouldn't it be better
to see this in VR?

00:16:42.567 --> 00:16:44.400
Something else we're
working on, and there's

00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:48.270
a first version of this in an
SDK we just shipped yesterday,

00:16:48.270 --> 00:16:51.350
is support for Unity Remote.

00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:55.410
The way this works is I
have the phone in Cardboard,

00:16:55.410 --> 00:17:00.840
and I can move the phone around,
and it's reading the neck

00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:04.950
movements, and I can edit
in Unity at the same time

00:17:04.950 --> 00:17:07.690
as it's in my eyes.

00:17:07.690 --> 00:17:09.170
I made the scene much smaller.

00:17:09.170 --> 00:17:11.740
I looked down, and
now I became giant.

00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:14.209
I didn't have to wait for
a compiling application,

00:17:14.209 --> 00:17:15.750
didn't have to wait
for it to show up

00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:19.150
on the phone to realize this is
too small, it's big, whatever.

00:17:19.150 --> 00:17:21.869
So this just super rapid
development process.

00:17:21.869 --> 00:17:23.440
It's very handy.

00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:25.220
I love the feature
and you will, too.

00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:31.506
So for more information, go to
Cardboard Developer website.

00:17:35.475 --> 00:17:36.850
Go there, download
what you need.

00:17:36.850 --> 00:17:38.620
There's a lot of documentation.

00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:41.680
To summarize, I told you
about a few interesting things

00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:42.290
about humans.

00:17:42.290 --> 00:17:45.640
I told you about convergence,
IPD, and field of view,

00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:49.490
as well as position
of the person.

00:17:49.490 --> 00:17:52.944
You saw how easy it is to
create your own Cardboard app

00:17:52.944 --> 00:17:54.860
and I shared with you
some of the things we're

00:17:54.860 --> 00:17:57.790
playing with there on
the team, including

00:17:57.790 --> 00:18:00.290
one that is in the SDK already,
which is the remote control

00:18:00.290 --> 00:18:00.790
thing.

00:18:00.790 --> 00:18:02.540
It's cool.

00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:05.132
So please welcome Alex.

00:18:05.132 --> 00:18:07.090
He's going to tell you
about design principles.

00:18:07.090 --> 00:18:08.057
Thank you.

00:18:08.057 --> 00:18:11.357
[APPLAUSE]

00:18:11.357 --> 00:18:12.690
ALEX FAABORG: Thank you, Manuel.

00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:20.030
This is an absolutely amazing
time to be a designer,

00:18:20.030 --> 00:18:23.214
and the reason it's so amazing
is just how new VR design is

00:18:23.214 --> 00:18:25.005
and how much we have
to learn and discover.

00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:30.340
This isn't the definitive
talk about VR design.

00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:31.590
It's still too early for that.

00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:34.022
I look forward to being able
to give that talk eventually.

00:18:34.022 --> 00:18:35.480
But this talk does
cover what we've

00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:37.200
learned so far,
both as a team also

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:39.000
as an industry over
the last few years

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:40.500
as we've been diving
into VR design.

00:18:43.250 --> 00:18:45.907
One of the things we found, and
we saw this with the examples

00:18:45.907 --> 00:18:47.990
that Manuel was just showing
with the live preview

00:18:47.990 --> 00:18:49.406
and design, is
really the best way

00:18:49.406 --> 00:18:52.382
to learn about VR
design is in VR itself.

00:18:52.382 --> 00:18:54.840
And this was actually a bit of
a challenge for me recently.

00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:57.360
I was writing the
style guidelines that

00:18:57.360 --> 00:19:00.510
are online on the web
and thinking, man,

00:19:00.510 --> 00:19:03.940
it would be a lot easier
to let people actually try

00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:07.170
this out instead of trying to
write these long paragraphs.

00:19:07.170 --> 00:19:09.150
So today, we have
an announcement

00:19:09.150 --> 00:19:11.300
that we're extremely
excited about.

00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:13.520
We're releasing something
called the Cardboard Design

00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:15.686
Lab the teams worked on.

00:19:15.686 --> 00:19:17.060
The great thing
about this is you

00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:18.680
can learn about VR
design principles

00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:21.440
actually in VR, in
its native habitat.

00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:24.000
So we have a bunch
of examples, things

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.030
that are very foundational,
things like using a reticle

00:19:27.030 --> 00:19:29.842
or keeping the user grounded,
motion, things like that.

00:19:29.842 --> 00:19:31.550
We also have a lot of
more advanced stuff

00:19:31.550 --> 00:19:33.633
and more immersive concepts,
like guiding the user

00:19:33.633 --> 00:19:36.120
with light, spatial,
audio, gaze cues.

00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:38.080
So definitely go
download this app

00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:39.660
and try out all
of the 10 lessons

00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:42.891
that we have built into it to
learn about these principles.

00:19:42.891 --> 00:19:44.640
If you're actually
watching this on video,

00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:46.510
I would encourage you to
pause and try out the app

00:19:46.510 --> 00:19:48.343
and then come back, and
we'll talk about all

00:19:48.343 --> 00:19:51.594
of the principles
in much more detail.

00:19:51.594 --> 00:19:53.510
So when you're designing
for VR, you're really

00:19:53.510 --> 00:19:55.301
designing for the
capabilities of the human

00:19:55.301 --> 00:19:58.080
as much as you're designing for
the capabilities of the system,

00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:00.371
so it's really important that
you understand your users

00:20:00.371 --> 00:20:02.200
and what they're capable of.

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:04.990
So first we'll start
out with a story.

00:20:04.990 --> 00:20:07.680
Imagine it's a beautiful morning
hundreds of thousands of years

00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:10.850
ago and you wake up and
you're feeling great.

00:20:10.850 --> 00:20:11.715
The sun is shining.

00:20:11.715 --> 00:20:14.550
You look outside your cave and
you don't see any predators.

00:20:14.550 --> 00:20:16.250
That's awesome.

00:20:16.250 --> 00:20:20.350
And you're starving so it's
time to start foraging for food.

00:20:20.350 --> 00:20:22.460
So you head out and
you find some berries,

00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:24.920
these red berries, and you've
never seen anything like this

00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:25.420
before.

00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:26.684
These look delicious.

00:20:26.684 --> 00:20:29.350
So you start eating them and you
realize immediately that things

00:20:29.350 --> 00:20:30.560
have gone horribly wrong.

00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:33.140
You've got this
ringing in your ears,

00:20:33.140 --> 00:20:34.720
your vision's a
little bit blurry,

00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:37.180
and the worst part is
everything is kind of wooshy,

00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:39.020
like you move and the
world doesn't totally

00:20:39.020 --> 00:20:40.320
track correctly.

00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:42.310
And this is a really
critical moment for you

00:20:42.310 --> 00:20:44.430
because you basically
have two options.

00:20:44.430 --> 00:20:47.730
You can eject the berries,
or if you don't, it's

00:20:47.730 --> 00:20:49.790
unfortunately game over.

00:20:49.790 --> 00:20:54.400
And we've evolved to be
very sensitive to vestibular

00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:55.940
ocular disparities.

00:20:55.940 --> 00:20:59.280
Motion sickness is actually
a defensive mechanism

00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:00.790
that comes through evolution.

00:21:00.790 --> 00:21:02.680
And the person that
ejected the berries,

00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:05.520
they're our ancestor
because they survived.

00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:09.335
So bad input can really cause
a bad physiological response

00:21:09.335 --> 00:21:10.960
for users, and this
is something that's

00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:13.277
really important with VR design.

00:21:13.277 --> 00:21:15.110
Of course, we're familiar
with phones having

00:21:15.110 --> 00:21:16.620
an inertial measurement unit.

00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:18.720
We have one as well
called our cochlea.

00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:21.150
It's sort of a series
of tubes in our ear

00:21:21.150 --> 00:21:23.310
and in our vestibular system.

00:21:23.310 --> 00:21:25.844
And as we're thinking about
the system as a whole,

00:21:25.844 --> 00:21:27.760
we have the phone's
inertial measurement unit.

00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:29.600
We also have our own.

00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:32.230
We have the screen and
our eyes, and all of this

00:21:32.230 --> 00:21:35.331
has to work in tangent, in
unison as part of the system.

00:21:35.331 --> 00:21:36.830
So it's really
important that you're

00:21:36.830 --> 00:21:39.288
getting good input to the user
based off of their movements

00:21:39.288 --> 00:21:41.680
and what they're seeing
because if it doesn't, then

00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:44.980
that's going to create bad
physiological responses.

00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:47.910
So this is a complex
way of saying always

00:21:47.910 --> 00:21:49.570
maintain head tracking.

00:21:49.570 --> 00:21:51.020
Never drop frames.

00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:55.950
If you're starting to load a
new scene in your application,

00:21:55.950 --> 00:22:00.679
it's not OK to freeze all of
a sudden and let that come in.

00:22:00.679 --> 00:22:02.470
Be sure that you're
monitoring performance,

00:22:02.470 --> 00:22:04.522
that you're always
maintaining head tracking.

00:22:04.522 --> 00:22:05.730
It's really, really critical.

00:22:05.730 --> 00:22:08.050
If for any reason you
can't, just fade to black

00:22:08.050 --> 00:22:10.550
and keep using audio
in your application

00:22:10.550 --> 00:22:14.572
because people are very
sensitive to these things.

00:22:14.572 --> 00:22:16.780
Another thing to talk about
is motion and the concept

00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:18.270
of constant velocity.

00:22:18.270 --> 00:22:19.480
So it's kind of strange.

00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:20.850
We actually don't feel velocity.

00:22:20.850 --> 00:22:23.000
We feel acceleration
and deceleration.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.670
So an example of this is
when you're in an airplane,

00:22:25.670 --> 00:22:28.690
you definitely feel the take
off and you feel the landing,

00:22:28.690 --> 00:22:30.580
but when you're actually
just flying around,

00:22:30.580 --> 00:22:32.907
it doesn't feel like you're
going 500 miles per hour.

00:22:32.907 --> 00:22:34.740
You might feel some
turbulence or something,

00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:36.281
but the actual
velocity of the plane,

00:22:36.281 --> 00:22:38.594
you're not noticing that.

00:22:38.594 --> 00:22:39.260
Another example.

00:22:39.260 --> 00:22:41.070
We're all, of course,
on the planet Earth.

00:22:41.070 --> 00:22:42.576
It's traveling very fast.

00:22:42.576 --> 00:22:43.950
If the planet were
to decelerate,

00:22:43.950 --> 00:22:46.320
we would definitely feel
that, but while it's

00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:48.810
traveling at high velocity,
we're not feeling that at all.

00:22:48.810 --> 00:22:50.880
So this fact that we
don't feel velocity

00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:53.000
is actually really
important for VR design

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.570
as well because if you
have someone traveling

00:22:55.570 --> 00:22:57.440
at a constant velocity,
it's not going

00:22:57.440 --> 00:22:59.220
to be as disconcerting
as if you're

00:22:59.220 --> 00:23:01.220
having lots of acceleration
and deceleration

00:23:01.220 --> 00:23:03.470
because they're going to
notice that difference, when,

00:23:03.470 --> 00:23:06.011
if in VR they're accelerating
or decelerating, then obviously

00:23:06.011 --> 00:23:08.160
in reality, they're
just standing there.

00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:11.839
So that can also create
potentially some discomfort.

00:23:11.839 --> 00:23:12.880
And everyone's different.

00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:14.600
Everyone has different
tolerance levels

00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:16.760
for what they find
acceptable with motion,

00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:19.380
so it's really important to
try things out with users, even

00:23:19.380 --> 00:23:21.610
with constant velocity,
to see how they're feeling

00:23:21.610 --> 00:23:24.250
and if it's working.

00:23:24.250 --> 00:23:26.580
Another aspect about
motion is definitely keep

00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:29.820
a stable horizon line
inside your application.

00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:32.505
I'm sorry.

00:23:32.505 --> 00:23:35.990
If you don't, it'll--
don't drop frames, either.

00:23:35.990 --> 00:23:39.510
So let's talk about vision.

00:23:39.510 --> 00:23:42.314
A really common question with
vision that a lot of people

00:23:42.314 --> 00:23:43.730
talk about is what
resolution does

00:23:43.730 --> 00:23:47.444
the screen need to be for
resolution not to matter?

00:23:47.444 --> 00:23:48.610
It's a really good question.

00:23:48.610 --> 00:23:49.610
There's two parts of it.

00:23:49.610 --> 00:23:50.970
One is field of view.

00:23:50.970 --> 00:23:53.930
So again, everyone's different,
but for a lot of people,

00:23:53.930 --> 00:23:57.420
field of view of 210 degrees
horizontally by 100 degrees

00:23:57.420 --> 00:24:00.800
vertically will
cover everything.

00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:06.320
And then in terms of pixel
density, if for every degree,

00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:09.070
we had 60 by 60 pixels,
that would be pushing

00:24:09.070 --> 00:24:10.750
the limits of our vision.

00:24:10.750 --> 00:24:11.660
That would be 20/20.

00:24:11.660 --> 00:24:13.409
Some people have better
than 20/20 vision,

00:24:13.409 --> 00:24:18.030
so it's in that range of getting
up to 60 pixels per degree.

00:24:18.030 --> 00:24:20.740
So something like
a 12,600 screen

00:24:20.740 --> 00:24:23.994
by 6,000 with a 210 by 100
field of view would be great.

00:24:23.994 --> 00:24:25.660
That's probably
actually overshooting it

00:24:25.660 --> 00:24:27.534
because we actually only
have high resolution

00:24:27.534 --> 00:24:29.880
vision in our central
vision with our fovea.

00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:31.890
Our peripheral vision
is very blurry.

00:24:31.890 --> 00:24:34.192
This is assuming that you
had the same size pixels

00:24:34.192 --> 00:24:35.400
throughout the entire screen.

00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:37.200
You can build a
screen with pixels

00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:39.270
that were different sizes.

00:24:39.270 --> 00:24:43.090
So that's pretty high,
and we're not there yet.

00:24:43.090 --> 00:24:45.630
And as we are on this
progression of increasing

00:24:45.630 --> 00:24:47.906
screen technology
with phones, it

00:24:47.906 --> 00:24:49.655
seems like it's becoming
harder and harder

00:24:49.655 --> 00:24:50.682
to talk about screens.

00:24:50.682 --> 00:24:52.640
We, of course, have our
old favorites like VGA,

00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:54.700
but the recent acronyms
are getting increasingly

00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:58.800
ridiculous, plus we have all the
complexity of optics with VR.

00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:00.869
So I'd like to talk
about something

00:25:00.869 --> 00:25:02.660
we've been talking
about on the team, which

00:25:02.660 --> 00:25:05.550
is a really clear way to talk
about this is just pixels

00:25:05.550 --> 00:25:08.210
per degree and the number
of degrees of field of view,

00:25:08.210 --> 00:25:10.260
and just focus on
those two things.

00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:14.320
So again, if we can get
into 60 pixels per degree,

00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:17.130
now we're at an eye
limiting system.

00:25:17.130 --> 00:25:18.620
So reality, 60
pixels per degree,

00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:20.300
210 degrees field of view.

00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:22.700
Let's talk about
some of our devices.

00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:25.370
Nexus 5 on Cardboard,
not quite reality

00:25:25.370 --> 00:25:29.224
yet, 12 pixels per degree
and 85 degrees field of view.

00:25:29.224 --> 00:25:31.140
Nexus 6 on Cardboard
does a little bit better,

00:25:31.140 --> 00:25:33.500
increases up to 13,
but more notably

00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:38.240
increases the field of
view with the new Cardboard

00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:40.386
up to 100 degrees.

00:25:40.386 --> 00:25:42.010
Let's talk about
hearing now that we've

00:25:42.010 --> 00:25:43.800
talked about vision a bit.

00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:46.000
In a way, hearing is
kind of a type of vision.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:47.930
So the interesting
thing about hearing

00:25:47.930 --> 00:25:51.040
is it lets you see the
entire scene around you

00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:53.000
all at the same
time, and this can

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:55.350
help you build up a mental
model of what's there

00:25:55.350 --> 00:25:56.730
before you've even seen it.

00:25:56.730 --> 00:25:58.250
So let's try out an example.

00:25:58.250 --> 00:26:00.407
[BELL RINGING]

00:26:00.407 --> 00:26:02.990
So you guys all knew that there
was a bell there before I even

00:26:02.990 --> 00:26:03.880
turned to look at it.

00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:05.966
Let's try it again.

00:26:05.966 --> 00:26:07.466
There's supposed
to be another bell.

00:26:07.466 --> 00:26:09.170
[BELL RINGING]

00:26:09.170 --> 00:26:10.210
Sort of over there.

00:26:10.210 --> 00:26:14.280
So we're really good at
positioning audio spatially.

00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:16.760
And what's important for
this in terms of design

00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:20.620
is if you have something
creating audio in a scene,

00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:23.490
you can immediately cue
users in to it being there.

00:26:23.490 --> 00:26:28.267
So attaching a bell to your
interface is a bit much.

00:26:28.267 --> 00:26:29.850
You could just have
your interface hum

00:26:29.850 --> 00:26:31.939
or buzz or something
a little bit,

00:26:31.939 --> 00:26:34.480
but you can definitely direct
the user's attention with audio

00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:36.646
and you can fill them in
as to the world around them

00:26:36.646 --> 00:26:38.557
by using spatial audio.

00:26:38.557 --> 00:26:40.890
Let's talk a little bit about
designing the environment.

00:26:40.890 --> 00:26:43.800
So one of the first
mistakes we've made

00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:46.250
and most people
designing VR make

00:26:46.250 --> 00:26:48.480
is you drop user
into the environment

00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:49.610
and you're not really
thinking about where you're

00:26:49.610 --> 00:26:51.370
going to drop them in
so they immediately

00:26:51.370 --> 00:26:54.010
start colliding with an object.

00:26:54.010 --> 00:26:57.670
This is very disconcerting
and sort of uncomfortable.

00:26:57.670 --> 00:27:00.100
It's not literally uncomfortable
because it's virtual,

00:27:00.100 --> 00:27:03.430
but you look down and you see
something coming through you

00:27:03.430 --> 00:27:05.510
and it's not good.

00:27:05.510 --> 00:27:07.780
You feel uneasy about it.

00:27:07.780 --> 00:27:10.080
So we talked a lot about
physiological comfort.

00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:12.407
It's also important to talk
about environmental comfort

00:27:12.407 --> 00:27:14.740
and the types of things that
make people environmentally

00:27:14.740 --> 00:27:15.750
uncomfortable.

00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:18.870
So obviously, heights
is a big one for people.

00:27:18.870 --> 00:27:20.760
People can be scared of heights.

00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:24.194
Also small spaces,
claustrophobia.

00:27:24.194 --> 00:27:25.610
Then there's the
opposite of that.

00:27:25.610 --> 00:27:28.450
For me, actually, I'm
more with agoraphobia,

00:27:28.450 --> 00:27:31.180
large spaces, big, empty rooms.

00:27:31.180 --> 00:27:33.290
Imagine working at a desk
with a single spotlight

00:27:33.290 --> 00:27:34.280
down on your desk.

00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:37.547
That would be very unnerving.

00:27:37.547 --> 00:27:38.630
Scale is very interesting.

00:27:38.630 --> 00:27:40.130
So when you have
small objects, they

00:27:40.130 --> 00:27:41.810
have this sort of
toy-like quality.

00:27:41.810 --> 00:27:43.340
They're very fun.

00:27:43.340 --> 00:27:45.510
You feel very powerful.

00:27:45.510 --> 00:27:46.780
You're this giant.

00:27:46.780 --> 00:27:48.030
You have this tiny truck.

00:27:48.030 --> 00:27:51.560
But if you invert that,
now it's very different.

00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:54.430
You feel very weak and
small and very intimidated

00:27:54.430 --> 00:27:55.400
by these big objects.

00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:57.300
It's not just
things like trucks.

00:27:57.300 --> 00:27:59.840
You could build a user
interface that was really big,

00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:02.530
and the user will feel small
and diminished in front of it,

00:28:02.530 --> 00:28:04.330
like the interface
itself will make user

00:28:04.330 --> 00:28:06.520
feel slightly uncomfortable.

00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:09.460
Other things about
environmental comfort.

00:28:09.460 --> 00:28:12.220
Obviously, people don't
like to be crushed.

00:28:12.220 --> 00:28:15.280
This is an extreme example,
but another example.

00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:17.780
I was in a VR simulation and
it was just planets rotating

00:28:17.780 --> 00:28:18.280
around.

00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:20.720
It was beautiful, but then
suddenly, one of the planets

00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:23.120
was coming right out
me, and part of my brain

00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:26.380
was thinking, get out of
the way, get out of the way.

00:28:26.380 --> 00:28:27.764
You can't turn that off.

00:28:27.764 --> 00:28:29.680
And for that moment, it
was very uncomfortable

00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:31.497
as I had to remind
myself, no, it's fine.

00:28:31.497 --> 00:28:33.830
This planet is just going to
collide straight through me

00:28:33.830 --> 00:28:35.512
and everything's
going to be great.

00:28:35.512 --> 00:28:36.970
So people don't
like to be crushed.

00:28:36.970 --> 00:28:37.875
Also, sharp objects.

00:28:37.875 --> 00:28:40.680
People aren't super
fond of those.

00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:43.130
For sharp objects in
particular, people

00:28:43.130 --> 00:28:44.970
are very protective
of their eyes.

00:28:44.970 --> 00:28:47.160
So imagine you have a
meditation application that

00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:50.370
has little hummingbirds in it,
and one of those hummingbirds

00:28:50.370 --> 00:28:52.190
floats up with its
little hummingbird beak

00:28:52.190 --> 00:28:53.620
right next to your eye.

00:28:53.620 --> 00:28:57.597
The user is going to recoil
away and defensively block,

00:28:57.597 --> 00:29:00.180
and that was not what you wanted
because this was a meditation

00:29:00.180 --> 00:29:00.680
application.

00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:01.950
You're supposed to be relaxed.

00:29:01.950 --> 00:29:05.050
So the important thing
about environmental comfort

00:29:05.050 --> 00:29:07.570
is to be intentional,
to in testing,

00:29:07.570 --> 00:29:09.110
see the types of
things that people

00:29:09.110 --> 00:29:12.620
find unnerving for various
reasons, to think about it

00:29:12.620 --> 00:29:16.222
and then involve this as
part of your testing process.

00:29:16.222 --> 00:29:18.430
You're not just doing
physiological comfort, but also

00:29:18.430 --> 00:29:20.570
environmental comfort.

00:29:20.570 --> 00:29:22.580
So a quick note
about perspective.

00:29:22.580 --> 00:29:24.580
Almost all VR apps are
first person perspective,

00:29:24.580 --> 00:29:26.210
which makes a lot of sense.

00:29:26.210 --> 00:29:28.910
Third person perspective
is also really interesting.

00:29:28.910 --> 00:29:30.880
This is an app called
RoboBliteration.

00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:31.687
It's really fun.

00:29:31.687 --> 00:29:34.270
You have this little spaceship
that you control with your head

00:29:34.270 --> 00:29:36.281
and it moves on the
surface of an asteroid.

00:29:36.281 --> 00:29:38.280
So I think third person
perspective games for VR

00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:40.470
are also super compelling
and we're probably

00:29:40.470 --> 00:29:42.990
going to see a lot more of them
be considered in the future

00:29:42.990 --> 00:29:45.050
as well.

00:29:45.050 --> 00:29:47.210
So moving on to
interaction design,

00:29:47.210 --> 00:29:50.060
for a system like Cardboard,
basically, all interaction

00:29:50.060 --> 00:29:51.850
is by moving your
head gaze at objects

00:29:51.850 --> 00:29:53.080
and then clicking on them.

00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:57.460
So you're casting this ray
out of your head to set focus.

00:29:57.460 --> 00:30:00.175
Something we've found is when
people first try Cardboard,

00:30:00.175 --> 00:30:01.550
they don't really
move their head

00:30:01.550 --> 00:30:03.799
very much because they haven't
really realized it yet.

00:30:03.799 --> 00:30:06.790
So they just hold Cardboard
up and they stand very still,

00:30:06.790 --> 00:30:09.430
and that can be a little
frustrating as a designer

00:30:09.430 --> 00:30:11.010
because you've
created all stuff.

00:30:11.010 --> 00:30:13.130
So something to do
with is you just

00:30:13.130 --> 00:30:15.239
have something interesting
offscreen just a little

00:30:15.239 --> 00:30:16.780
bit in their field
of view, something

00:30:16.780 --> 00:30:18.344
to course them to
took over at it,

00:30:18.344 --> 00:30:20.260
then they'll realize
that head tracking works.

00:30:20.260 --> 00:30:22.510
As soon as they've done even a
little bit of a head movement,

00:30:22.510 --> 00:30:24.020
they get it and
they start looking

00:30:24.020 --> 00:30:25.810
around all over the place.

00:30:25.810 --> 00:30:29.295
And then as you have users
starting to look around,

00:30:29.295 --> 00:30:30.670
think about designs
that actually

00:30:30.670 --> 00:30:32.050
leverage the whole canvas.

00:30:32.050 --> 00:30:34.210
We don't have to design
for these small, 2D devices

00:30:34.210 --> 00:30:36.467
anymore, so we can create
interfaces that actually

00:30:36.467 --> 00:30:38.050
surround and encompass
the user and do

00:30:38.050 --> 00:30:40.636
these really creative things
that haven't been possible

00:30:40.636 --> 00:30:42.340
in the past.

00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:44.450
There's tremendous
opportunity here.

00:30:44.450 --> 00:30:47.440
There's also some challenge
because the camera

00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:48.060
has free will.

00:30:48.060 --> 00:30:50.630
So from the perspective
of a director

00:30:50.630 --> 00:30:52.070
or a cinematographer
where they're

00:30:52.070 --> 00:30:53.590
very focused on
telling their story

00:30:53.590 --> 00:30:55.410
and controlling
everything, they're

00:30:55.410 --> 00:30:57.076
probably a little bit
scared of the fact

00:30:57.076 --> 00:30:58.630
that users can look anywhere.

00:30:58.630 --> 00:31:01.090
How are we going
to deal with that?

00:31:01.090 --> 00:31:04.090
So there's a couple ways of
directing the user's attention.

00:31:04.090 --> 00:31:07.410
One of them is sort of
a brute force approach,

00:31:07.410 --> 00:31:09.020
just rotation on scene change.

00:31:09.020 --> 00:31:11.850
So say it's a spherical
video and the user's

00:31:11.850 --> 00:31:14.160
looking at a particular spot,
but the next spot that's

00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:15.700
interesting is off to the side.

00:31:15.700 --> 00:31:17.950
As you're doing that scene
change and fading to black,

00:31:17.950 --> 00:31:19.730
you can actually just
rotate that sphere

00:31:19.730 --> 00:31:20.970
so that wherever
the user's looking,

00:31:20.970 --> 00:31:23.428
the next interesting thing is
going to be in front of them.

00:31:23.428 --> 00:31:26.092
Now, don't do the
rotation unless you're

00:31:26.092 --> 00:31:28.550
fading to black because that
could make the user very sick,

00:31:28.550 --> 00:31:30.640
having the world
spin all of a sudden,

00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:33.170
but that's one way of
directing the user's attention.

00:31:33.170 --> 00:31:37.460
Another way which is more subtle
is guiding the user with light.

00:31:37.460 --> 00:31:39.650
This is a really popular
one in video game design.

00:31:39.650 --> 00:31:42.480
So for people that are designing
levels for video games,

00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:45.790
you'll often notice that
you just know the right way

00:31:45.790 --> 00:31:46.940
to go through a level.

00:31:46.940 --> 00:31:50.400
You usually find the right
path and keep walking.

00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:53.630
If you're not paying
attention and you go back,

00:31:53.630 --> 00:31:56.290
you'll see that often, they're
really lighting your path very

00:31:56.290 --> 00:31:59.910
clearly, and that's how you just
intuitively know the right way

00:31:59.910 --> 00:32:03.040
to go, these very subtle
cues with the lighting.

00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:04.837
So we actually
have some examples

00:32:04.837 --> 00:32:06.420
about this in the
Cardboard Design Lab

00:32:06.420 --> 00:32:11.460
you can try out where people are
looking at the brightest parts.

00:32:11.460 --> 00:32:14.214
Another thing we've been
exploring is gaze cues.

00:32:14.214 --> 00:32:16.630
So this is where you're tracking
where the user's looking,

00:32:16.630 --> 00:32:18.132
this ray that
they're casting out,

00:32:18.132 --> 00:32:19.840
and then that's actually
having an impact

00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:21.030
on the world around them.

00:32:21.030 --> 00:32:23.580
So we have an example where
you look at constellations

00:32:23.580 --> 00:32:26.790
and they illuminate, which
is sort of an interesting way

00:32:26.790 --> 00:32:29.029
to make the world slightly
interactive with how

00:32:29.029 --> 00:32:30.820
the user is looking at
things and exploring

00:32:30.820 --> 00:32:32.880
more details of the world.

00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:37.420
You can also use gaze cues
as a very technical technique

00:32:37.420 --> 00:32:40.440
as you're staging things
out in your VR application.

00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:41.910
So in the lab
right before, we're

00:32:41.910 --> 00:32:45.050
actually teaching spatial
audio, the bell thing,

00:32:45.050 --> 00:32:46.720
although in this
case, it's not a bell.

00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:47.910
We have an owl.

00:32:47.910 --> 00:32:51.330
When you look at the fire,
that triggers the owl appearing

00:32:51.330 --> 00:32:53.080
because at this point,
we know that you're

00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:54.590
looking at the fire.

00:32:54.590 --> 00:32:55.490
And we know you're going
to look at the fire

00:32:55.490 --> 00:32:57.090
because it's the
brightest thing.

00:32:57.090 --> 00:32:59.610
So we're actually staging
the owl coming out

00:32:59.610 --> 00:33:02.280
off of a gaze queue, and
then the owl shows up.

00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:03.835
It's sort of a jump scare owl.

00:33:03.835 --> 00:33:06.180
It's kind of fun.

00:33:06.180 --> 00:33:09.980
So the final thing about
interaction design.

00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:12.840
Let's talk about in
world user interfaces.

00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:15.824
So the important thing
to note with VR design

00:33:15.824 --> 00:33:17.240
is you can design
the whole world,

00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:19.619
so you don't have
to build interfaces

00:33:19.619 --> 00:33:22.160
in that world for the user to
use as much as you can actually

00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:25.270
embody those interfaces
in the world itself.

00:33:25.270 --> 00:33:27.890
So one developer in the
industry spoke about this

00:33:27.890 --> 00:33:30.480
as don't have a
little health bar--

00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:32.000
say you're flying a spaceship.

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:33.890
Instead, look out and
actually see the damage

00:33:33.890 --> 00:33:35.140
on the wing of your spaceship.

00:33:35.140 --> 00:33:37.181
That's a much more
interesting and compelling way

00:33:37.181 --> 00:33:38.660
to convey that same information.

00:33:38.660 --> 00:33:40.860
Don't have all these
little meta indicators

00:33:40.860 --> 00:33:42.840
that are built in
because you can actually

00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:46.680
expose that interface
in the world design.

00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:49.180
And across the board, as we've
been doing all of this design

00:33:49.180 --> 00:33:53.170
work, something we found is that
VR is a really powerful medium.

00:33:53.170 --> 00:33:55.180
And there's three
things that happened

00:33:55.180 --> 00:33:59.370
to be recently that
convinced me of this,

00:33:59.370 --> 00:34:02.320
just fundamentally convinced
me VR is incredibly powerful.

00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:04.110
The first one is
I actually forgot

00:34:04.110 --> 00:34:08.070
I was in VR, which is maybe
a little embarrassing.

00:34:08.070 --> 00:34:10.670
This was a couple weeks ago.

00:34:10.670 --> 00:34:13.780
So I was sitting in a
movie theater simulation.

00:34:13.780 --> 00:34:15.822
I was at work, and I
was watching trailers,

00:34:15.822 --> 00:34:17.280
and I hadn't seen
the trailers yet,

00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:18.679
so they were kind
of interesting.

00:34:18.679 --> 00:34:20.970
And then I was really worried
because I haven't started

00:34:20.970 --> 00:34:23.409
preparing for my I/O talk yet.

00:34:23.409 --> 00:34:25.449
So I've got multiple
levels of distraction going

00:34:25.449 --> 00:34:28.500
on there with the trailers
and also the worrying,

00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:30.770
and then some people right
next to me started talking,

00:34:30.770 --> 00:34:33.389
and I turned, and
there was no one there.

00:34:33.389 --> 00:34:36.469
And I thought, that's weird.

00:34:36.469 --> 00:34:37.360
It's not right.

00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:41.877
And then I realized, oh,
it's because I'm in VR.

00:34:41.877 --> 00:34:43.710
That was the first time
that happened to me.

00:34:43.710 --> 00:34:46.239
So I think with
enough distraction,

00:34:46.239 --> 00:34:48.219
our minds are set
up to start taking

00:34:48.219 --> 00:34:49.889
the input they're getting.

00:34:49.889 --> 00:34:51.962
So you can have
these moments where--

00:34:51.962 --> 00:34:54.170
I mean, we have this even
when you're reading a book,

00:34:54.170 --> 00:34:55.753
you get lost in the
story of the book,

00:34:55.753 --> 00:34:57.880
so it's very easy for people
to get lost in things.

00:34:57.880 --> 00:35:00.170
But getting lost in
VR is quite something.

00:35:02.680 --> 00:35:05.390
The second thing that we
found very interesting

00:35:05.390 --> 00:35:07.580
as a team is the
industry has talked a lot

00:35:07.580 --> 00:35:09.740
about presence, this
notion of accepting

00:35:09.740 --> 00:35:13.250
the simulation as reality for
a moment and rolling with it.

00:35:13.250 --> 00:35:16.340
Even more interesting
is pairing presence

00:35:16.340 --> 00:35:19.350
with the psychological
concept of flow

00:35:19.350 --> 00:35:24.240
where your creativity is
just completely engaged.

00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:27.200
In this case, with the
application Tilt Brush,

00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:28.970
you're just lost,
not just in VR,

00:35:28.970 --> 00:35:31.020
but you're also lost
in the creative task

00:35:31.020 --> 00:35:32.560
of sculpting and painting.

00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:34.518
And this can be a really
interesting experience

00:35:34.518 --> 00:35:39.020
when you just spend long periods
of time creating things in VR.

00:35:39.020 --> 00:35:41.580
And then the third thing
that's really struck me

00:35:41.580 --> 00:35:44.300
about VR interface
design is when

00:35:44.300 --> 00:35:46.080
you're thinking back
to VR experiences

00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:47.480
you had a long time ago.

00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:50.040
So because you're engaging
so much of your mind,

00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:52.370
like all of your spatial
memory, your sense of self

00:35:52.370 --> 00:35:55.229
is being engaged with VR,
you know it's not real

00:35:55.229 --> 00:35:57.770
and you can think back and you
know it wasn't real back then,

00:35:57.770 --> 00:35:59.860
but you're still storing
a lot of that experience

00:35:59.860 --> 00:36:02.420
as if it was a place
or as if it was a thing

00:36:02.420 --> 00:36:03.690
that you actually did.

00:36:03.690 --> 00:36:06.990
So thinking back to
VR, you're really

00:36:06.990 --> 00:36:09.530
for the first time
creating users' memories,

00:36:09.530 --> 00:36:11.440
and this is amazing
as a designer

00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:15.380
because now we can really
design rich experiences

00:36:15.380 --> 00:36:17.995
that people think of as
places and as experiences

00:36:17.995 --> 00:36:19.670
that they've had.

00:36:19.670 --> 00:36:23.420
So this is something the team's
incredibly excited about.

00:36:23.420 --> 00:36:25.270
Current contributions
so far, of course,

00:36:25.270 --> 00:36:27.140
go get the Cardboard
Design Lab to try out

00:36:27.140 --> 00:36:28.480
a lot of the VR principles.

00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:31.310
We also have a lot of
documentation online,

00:36:31.310 --> 00:36:33.036
and of course, the
SDK is available.

00:36:33.036 --> 00:36:34.536
And with that, we
have a few minutes

00:36:34.536 --> 00:36:35.770
left to take your questions.

00:36:35.770 --> 00:36:36.528
Thank you.

00:36:36.528 --> 00:36:39.456
[APPLAUSE]

00:36:44.539 --> 00:36:45.580
JON WILEY: Any questions?

00:36:45.580 --> 00:36:46.079
No?

00:36:46.079 --> 00:36:48.400
Microphone right there.

00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:49.570
Going once.

00:36:49.570 --> 00:36:53.640
Can you get to the microphone
so we can get it on video?

00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:54.140
No pressure.

00:37:01.666 --> 00:37:03.040
AUDIENCE: So you
talked about how

00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:06.690
you need 60 pixels per degree.

00:37:06.690 --> 00:37:08.310
If you change the
field of view--

00:37:08.310 --> 00:37:10.235
I think you mentioned this, but
you changed the field of view

00:37:10.235 --> 00:37:12.359
in the latest Cardboard
upgrade and so that changed

00:37:12.359 --> 00:37:13.317
the requirements.

00:37:13.317 --> 00:37:15.775
If the field of view is wider
but you have the same device,

00:37:15.775 --> 00:37:17.025
are you stretching it further?

00:37:17.025 --> 00:37:17.816
ALEX FAABORG: Yeah.

00:37:17.816 --> 00:37:19.680
So the pixels per
degree will actually

00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:22.060
go down if you're increasing
the field of view.

00:37:22.060 --> 00:37:26.230
AUDIENCE: Then how much
of this is lens specific?

00:37:26.230 --> 00:37:30.350
If I have the Gear
VR Oculus headset,

00:37:30.350 --> 00:37:32.490
are those lenses different
than the Cardboard

00:37:32.490 --> 00:37:36.560
lenses and the apps need to be
designed entirely differently?

00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:41.050
ALEX FAABORG: So for the
Works With Cardboard program,

00:37:41.050 --> 00:37:43.592
the user will scan a
QR code on the device

00:37:43.592 --> 00:37:45.800
and that communicates all
of the object's information

00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:48.470
so the developer doesn't have
to worry at all about all

00:37:48.470 --> 00:37:50.130
the objects out there.

00:37:50.130 --> 00:37:52.920
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:54.120
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:58.240
Thank you all for your amazing
insights into VR and Cardboard.

00:37:58.240 --> 00:38:01.070
I'm a little piggybacking
off of the prior question.

00:38:01.070 --> 00:38:04.080
I wanted to ask your thoughts
on a user's experience

00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:08.050
in Cardboard versus something
like Gear or Oculus,

00:38:08.050 --> 00:38:10.620
and perhaps something that
is a more high fidelity

00:38:10.620 --> 00:38:12.440
in the actual experience,
and your thoughts

00:38:12.440 --> 00:38:15.840
on the differences
between designing there

00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:18.590
and what you recommend
for users to really get

00:38:18.590 --> 00:38:22.640
that first amazing experience
that doesn't have nausea,

00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:25.070
that accounts for
parallax effect,

00:38:25.070 --> 00:38:27.434
and those types of things.

00:38:27.434 --> 00:38:28.100
JON WILEY: Yeah.

00:38:28.100 --> 00:38:32.224
I think there's a spectrum
of capability of devices

00:38:32.224 --> 00:38:34.390
out there, and so taking
into account the capability

00:38:34.390 --> 00:38:37.060
of the device is important.

00:38:37.060 --> 00:38:42.000
For Cardboard, we tend to
think of it as snackable VR.

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:45.400
It's not for long
duration experiences.

00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:48.250
Really, if you're going
to, as I was saying

00:38:48.250 --> 00:38:53.990
at the very top of it, which is
every capability that you add

00:38:53.990 --> 00:38:58.030
increases the constraints
around making sure

00:38:58.030 --> 00:39:01.650
it's golden in terms
of the experience.

00:39:01.650 --> 00:39:04.640
And so you can create
a richer experience

00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:07.817
with a more capable
device, but you just

00:39:07.817 --> 00:39:09.650
have to be extra, extra
careful to make sure

00:39:09.650 --> 00:39:11.320
that the experiences
is really living up

00:39:11.320 --> 00:39:13.620
to the expectations
of the device.

00:39:13.620 --> 00:39:17.200
So with devices like
Cardboard, at least today,

00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:19.850
given today's mobile
phone technology,

00:39:19.850 --> 00:39:21.320
it doesn't have
the full six degree

00:39:21.320 --> 00:39:24.664
of freedom tracking that
you move around in a space,

00:39:24.664 --> 00:39:26.330
so you just have to
be cognizant of that

00:39:26.330 --> 00:39:28.330
and designing for the
limitations of the device.

00:39:28.330 --> 00:39:30.630
I actually think
that the best designs

00:39:30.630 --> 00:39:34.210
come from not working
against the system

00:39:34.210 --> 00:39:36.977
but working with the system
to create a good experience.

00:39:36.977 --> 00:39:39.060
And so if you've got a
high end system that you're

00:39:39.060 --> 00:39:40.850
designing for, that's awesome.

00:39:40.850 --> 00:39:42.897
You can create amazing content.

00:39:42.897 --> 00:39:44.480
But I still think
that amazing content

00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:48.760
can be created on more
restrictive systems

00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:52.840
if it's playing to the
strengths of that system.

00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:54.820
I think we've got
time for one more.

00:39:58.910 --> 00:40:01.530
AUDIENCE: You kind of touched
on a little bit of user input

00:40:01.530 --> 00:40:03.450
and, you have
basically one button

00:40:03.450 --> 00:40:05.600
to interact with the system.

00:40:05.600 --> 00:40:08.780
Are there any plans
to up that ante

00:40:08.780 --> 00:40:13.380
to maybe allow users to
be more specific on input,

00:40:13.380 --> 00:40:17.370
like typing or voice
or things like that?

00:40:17.370 --> 00:40:20.160
JON WILEY: So I think part
of the magic of Cardboard

00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:23.824
is the simplicity of
the system, and in fact,

00:40:23.824 --> 00:40:25.490
with the version we
announced yesterday,

00:40:25.490 --> 00:40:27.669
we actually made it a
lot easier to assemble.

00:40:27.669 --> 00:40:29.210
So if anything, with
Cardboard, we're

00:40:29.210 --> 00:40:32.150
going to keep pushing
to make it more simple.

00:40:32.150 --> 00:40:37.810
But that said, we just
showed the Tilt Brush example

00:40:37.810 --> 00:40:39.590
and the notion of
presence and flow.

00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:46.680
Like with Tilt Brush, if
you can try Tilt Brush,

00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:48.800
I highly recommend it
because you can really

00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:51.730
get that sense of
working with your hands

00:40:51.730 --> 00:40:53.850
and working in space
and things like that.

00:40:53.850 --> 00:40:55.749
But as I was saying in
the previous question,

00:40:55.749 --> 00:40:57.540
every single time you
raise the capability,

00:40:57.540 --> 00:40:59.730
raise the expectations
for the experience,

00:40:59.730 --> 00:41:01.230
you have to be extra
careful to make

00:41:01.230 --> 00:41:03.085
sure you're designing for that.

00:41:03.085 --> 00:41:04.543
So that's one of
the reasons why we

00:41:04.543 --> 00:41:07.600
want to keep Cardboard really
simple because that's actually

00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:10.190
playing to the strength
of a great experience

00:41:10.190 --> 00:41:12.072
for a Cardboard class.

00:41:12.072 --> 00:41:14.030
MANUEL CLEMENT: I just
wanted to add Cardboard,

00:41:14.030 --> 00:41:15.530
you put it very
quickly on your face

00:41:15.530 --> 00:41:17.210
for a snackable experience.

00:41:17.210 --> 00:41:20.460
Your hands are also busy
holding it and then handing it

00:41:20.460 --> 00:41:22.680
to your friend, like, oh my
gosh, this looks amazing.

00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:25.280
So your hands are this
very social experience.

00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:27.380
So your hands are
used there already,

00:41:27.380 --> 00:41:30.870
so it's something to think
about as you build experiences.

00:41:30.870 --> 00:41:32.170
Your hands will be on there.

00:41:32.170 --> 00:41:35.880
AUDIENCE: On that note,
is length of experience

00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:39.690
a factor that developers
should-- like length of time

00:41:39.690 --> 00:41:41.030
that the experience lasts?

00:41:41.030 --> 00:41:42.500
JON WILEY: Yeah.

00:41:42.500 --> 00:41:46.310
I think for Cardboard, you
want it to be, as I said,

00:41:46.310 --> 00:41:51.020
snackable experiences, so more
like more traditional YouTube

00:41:51.020 --> 00:41:55.724
content versus like a long
form experience of Cardboard.

00:41:55.724 --> 00:41:57.140
Thanks, everybody,
for coming out.

00:41:57.140 --> 00:42:00.490
