00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:02.860
Cheerio!

00:00:02.859 --> 00:00:05.929
Sorry, I can't do it.

00:00:05.929 --> 00:00:07.719
Can't do the cheerio?

00:00:07.719 --> 00:00:09.020
That was part of a script.

00:00:09.021 --> 00:00:09.520
Oh.

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:11.230
That was a great
[INTERPOSING VOICES].

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:12.640
Let's try it once more.

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.539
Welcome to Client Server
Communications, a course

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:19.919
about the web.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.670
Technically, the web is only
a small part of the internet.

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.530
However, it is the only
part of the internet

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:27.960
that people use without
even realizing that what

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.219
they're using is the web.

00:00:30.219 --> 00:00:33.089
The web is the platform
that you, the web developer,

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.950
can use to publish your
ideas to the world.

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:38.490
It is the common language
between your servers

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:40.950
and your clients.

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.250
Every time you open a browser,
every time you download an app,

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.130
every time you receive a
message on WhatsApp or Facebook,

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:48.740
you're using the web.

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:50.789
More generically,
in that very moment,

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.369
a client is communicating
with a server, and vice versa.

00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:56.219
But what does that
actually mean?

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.679
What's happening when you
navigate to a web site?

00:00:58.679 --> 00:01:01.670
How did the phone know that
somebody sent me a message?

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.420
What capabilities does the web
have, and more importantly,

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.420
what are its limitations?

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.049
Hi.

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.189
I'm Surma.

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.750
I'm an engineer at
Google in London,

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.909
and I work with the Chrome team.

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.859
In this course, we are
going to understand

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:17.370
what the web actually is, how
we can use it to your advantage,

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:20.130
and how you can avoid mistakes
that will make both your user

00:01:20.129 --> 00:01:23.219
experience and security suffer.

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:26.789
Some of this may seem like
[INAUDIBLE] to you, and it is,

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.132
but we will also go into the
lesser known parts of HTTP.

00:01:30.132 --> 00:01:31.590
To think like an
engineer, you need

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.770
to understand both the
semantics that HTTP uses,

00:01:34.769 --> 00:01:38.219
as well as the implementation
inside the browser.

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:41.189
We'll use that knowledge to
use browser APIs to the fullest

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.700
potential, secure HTTP
against eavesdroppers,

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.390
and deploy the web's
newest protocol, HTTP2.

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.060
All this knowledge will help
you make informed decisions

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.540
for your app and persuade others
when optimizing and securing

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.609
their apps.

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:57.299
Hi.

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.579
I'm Richard, a course
developer at Udacity

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.679
and an experienced
web developer.

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.500
While Surma teaches you about
HTTP's request and response

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.790
cycle, security, and the
best practices of HTTP2,

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:09.900
I'll be here to
reinforce this knowledge

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:11.610
with examples and quizzes.

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.950
Understanding both the
capabilities and limitations

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:16.560
of the medium we work
in on a day to day basis

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.830
will help you take the next
important step towards mastery.

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.290
By the end of this course,
you will understand literally

00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:24.840
every byte that is being sent
from your browser to the server

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.509
and back.
