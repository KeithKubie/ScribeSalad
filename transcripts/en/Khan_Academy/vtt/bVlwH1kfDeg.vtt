00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:02.813
- [Voiceover] This is
a quote by a physicist

00:00:02.813 --> 00:00:05.617
as a comment on one of
his experimental results.

00:00:06.041 --> 00:00:08.223
He said, about his experiment, he said,

00:00:08.223 --> 00:00:10.917
"It was as if you fired a 15-inch shell

00:00:10.917 --> 00:00:13.000
"at a piece of tissue paper,

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:16.586
"and it came back and hit you."

00:00:16.588 --> 00:00:20.266
So let's talk about his
experiment and what he was doing.

00:00:20.266 --> 00:00:24.410
Rutherford, at the time, had
been doing a lot of research

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:26.216
on radioactivity.

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.161
He was friends with Marie
Curie and her husband, Pierre.

00:00:32.212 --> 00:00:34.952
And he had done a lot of studies

00:00:34.952 --> 00:00:37.506
looking at the different
kinds of reactivity,

00:00:37.506 --> 00:00:41.308
and more specifically, he
was curious at this time

00:00:41.871 --> 00:00:45.338
about alpha particles,

00:00:46.978 --> 00:00:48.399
which are,

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.308
actually, at the time, he didn't know

00:00:50.308 --> 00:00:52.712
what they were, but we now know they are

00:00:52.712 --> 00:00:55.706
Helium, 2+ nuclei.

00:00:55.706 --> 00:01:00.252
So that means we have two
protons in the nucleus,

00:01:00.252 --> 00:01:04.469
since it's Helium, and
it also has two neutrons.

00:01:05.333 --> 00:01:07.237
And it doesn't have any
electrons, and thus,

00:01:07.237 --> 00:01:09.275
it has a 2+ charge.

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.228
So what Rutherford did,
he took a piece of radium

00:01:13.228 --> 00:01:15.660
and he put it inside a lead box.

00:01:17.593 --> 00:01:21.094
And the lead box had a
small hole in it on one side

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:26.155
so that the radioactive alpha particles

00:01:27.438 --> 00:01:31.287
could come out of that hole in
the direction that he wanted.

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:36.307
And then, he shot the alpha particles

00:01:36.307 --> 00:01:39.231
at a piece of gold foil,

00:01:39.747 --> 00:01:42.570
a very thin piece of gold foil.

00:01:45.362 --> 00:01:49.639
And he was curious to see if
he could learn a little bit

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:52.692
about the structure of the
atom using this experiment.

00:01:52.692 --> 00:01:55.095
So, if we look back at our quote,

00:01:55.095 --> 00:01:59.571
we would say that our
alpha particles here,

00:02:00.041 --> 00:02:03.479
the alpha particles are the bullets

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:09.790
that are coming out of our
alpha particle gun, and

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.440
gold foil is our tissue paper.

00:02:16.816 --> 00:02:19.393
And we have these pretty fast and massive

00:02:19.393 --> 00:02:21.581
alpha particles that we're shooting at it.

00:02:21.581 --> 00:02:25.658
But why was Rutherford
expecting that to happen here?

00:02:25.658 --> 00:02:27.604
It's not necessarily straightforward,

00:02:27.604 --> 00:02:30.390
at least to me, why you would
think these alpha particles

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.660
would just go straight
through the gold foil.

00:02:33.478 --> 00:02:37.315
So what Rutherford, at
the time, was doing was,

00:02:37.315 --> 00:02:40.671
he was testing the plum pudding model.

00:02:42.208 --> 00:02:46.132
So this is pretty early
in history, where we,

00:02:46.962 --> 00:02:49.546
we being scientists way back then,

00:02:49.546 --> 00:02:53.470
knew that J. J. Thomson,
another physicist,

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.834
had just discovered electrons.

00:02:55.834 --> 00:02:57.940
So we knew the atom,

00:02:58.945 --> 00:03:03.143
the atom had these particles
in it that were small,

00:03:03.143 --> 00:03:05.766
that were really small,
we knew that they were

00:03:07.586 --> 00:03:11.775
less than one percent the
mass of a Hydrogen atom,

00:03:11.775 --> 00:03:14.422
so way smaller than an atom.

00:03:14.422 --> 00:03:16.149
And we knew they were negatively charged,

00:03:16.149 --> 00:03:17.719
so I'm going to call them electrons

00:03:17.719 --> 00:03:19.989
'cause we know they're electrons now.

00:03:20.297 --> 00:03:23.091
And so J. J. Thomson knew

00:03:23.091 --> 00:03:26.342
that electrons existed

00:03:26.342 --> 00:03:28.465
based on his experimental results,

00:03:28.465 --> 00:03:31.251
and he proposed, based on his results,

00:03:31.251 --> 00:03:35.297
that an atom looks something
like a plum pudding.

00:03:35.297 --> 00:03:37.781
And if you don't know
what a plum pudding is,

00:03:37.781 --> 00:03:39.824
because maybe you're not British,

00:03:39.824 --> 00:03:41.914
or maybe you just don't like dessert,

00:03:41.914 --> 00:03:44.329
you can also imagine it
looking something like

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:46.316
a chocolate chip cookie.

00:03:46.316 --> 00:03:51.216
So we have these little
negatively-charged particles

00:03:51.471 --> 00:03:53.607
that are stuck inside the atom,

00:03:53.607 --> 00:03:57.090
but most of the atom is made up of

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.475
a positively-charged soup.

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:05.263
And this was mainly because

00:04:06.986 --> 00:04:10.530
the atom overall has to be neutral.

00:04:10.705 --> 00:04:12.957
Scientists knew that atoms were neutral,

00:04:12.957 --> 00:04:14.490
so there had to be something there

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:17.996
to cancel out the negative
charge of the electron.

00:04:19.901 --> 00:04:23.451
So because Rutherford was starting

00:04:23.451 --> 00:04:25.447
with this in his mind

00:04:25.447 --> 00:04:29.361
for what the gold atoms looked like,

00:04:29.361 --> 00:04:32.061
he could actually do
mathematical predictions

00:04:32.061 --> 00:04:34.289
on what the alpha particles would do.

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:35.891
And what he predicted was that

00:04:35.891 --> 00:04:38.533
they would just go straight through.

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:45.011
You can use physics equations
to look at the electric field

00:04:45.574 --> 00:04:48.587
that's generated by this
positively-charged soup,

00:04:48.587 --> 00:04:51.118
and it turns out that the field,

00:04:51.118 --> 00:04:53.788
because the charge is spread
out all over the atom,

00:04:53.788 --> 00:04:55.739
the field is very weak.

00:04:55.739 --> 00:04:57.829
And so, what he thought would happen

00:04:57.829 --> 00:05:00.034
was that all the particles
would just go straight through

00:05:00.034 --> 00:05:04.227
and then, occasionally, one
might be bent a little bit.

00:05:04.748 --> 00:05:06.493
Since we do have

00:05:07.023 --> 00:05:10.254
a positively-charged soupy atom,

00:05:10.704 --> 00:05:14.569
depending on where the
alpha particle goes through,

00:05:14.569 --> 00:05:16.822
he thought you might see a
little bit of deflection,

00:05:16.822 --> 00:05:18.929
but mostly, they should
go straight through.

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:23.095
And I guess we started with a spoiler,

00:05:23.095 --> 00:05:26.642
'cause we know that he didn't
quite get what he expected.

00:05:27.321 --> 00:05:29.916
So what exactly did Rutherford see?

00:05:30.897 --> 00:05:34.417
Well, he shot his alpha
particles at his tissue paper,

00:05:34.417 --> 00:05:39.057
and he saw most of the
particles go straight through,

00:05:40.082 --> 00:05:41.818
just as he expected.

00:05:42.567 --> 00:05:46.978
In fact, he saw almost all the particles

00:05:46.978 --> 00:05:48.279
go straight through.

00:05:48.279 --> 00:05:52.876
He saw a couple of them
be deflected a little bit,

00:05:52.876 --> 00:05:55.175
so they got deflected off their path

00:05:55.175 --> 00:05:57.450
maybe about one degree, so barely enough

00:05:57.450 --> 00:05:58.843
to be able to see it.

00:05:58.843 --> 00:06:03.173
And, if he had not been a curious chemist,

00:06:03.173 --> 00:06:05.664
we would maybe still think, right now,

00:06:05.664 --> 00:06:08.892
that this is what an atom looks like.

00:06:10.081 --> 00:06:14.348
But luckily, Rutherford was
a very thorough chemist,

00:06:14.679 --> 00:06:16.813
and he also thought,
it might be interesting

00:06:16.813 --> 00:06:20.506
to detect whether

00:06:21.389 --> 00:06:25.015
particles came, not just here,

00:06:25.015 --> 00:06:27.078
he didn't just put a detector screen here,

00:06:27.078 --> 00:06:30.746
he put a detector screen
that went all the way around.

00:06:34.183 --> 00:06:37.410
So, all the way around,
almost all the way around,

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:40.322
giving enough space for the
alpha particles to go in.

00:06:40.962 --> 00:06:44.469
And he was being really careful here,

00:06:44.469 --> 00:06:46.605
'cause he didn't really
expect to see anything

00:06:46.605 --> 00:06:48.416
right around here or here or here,

00:06:48.416 --> 00:06:50.000
or really anywhere except for here.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.764
But it turned out that for every

00:06:54.324 --> 00:06:56.371
one in...

00:06:57.091 --> 00:06:59.556
one in 20,000

00:06:59.556 --> 00:07:00.689
alpha particles,

00:07:00.689 --> 00:07:03.262
or some crazy-tiny number like that,

00:07:04.038 --> 00:07:06.754
for every one in 20,000 alpha particles,

00:07:06.754 --> 00:07:09.703
he saw the particles hit the gold foil

00:07:09.703 --> 00:07:11.800
and bounce back.

00:07:12.087 --> 00:07:13.720
And that's crazy, right?

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:15.252
That's exactly what you don't expect

00:07:15.252 --> 00:07:19.380
when you hit a piece of
tissue paper with a bullet.

00:07:20.012 --> 00:07:22.423
So the first thing he did, I think,

00:07:22.423 --> 00:07:25.051
was not go, hmmm, this is really crazy,

00:07:25.051 --> 00:07:27.303
we just won a Nobel Prize here.

00:07:27.303 --> 00:07:29.230
I'm pretty sure the
first thing he did was,

00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:30.600
this is weird.

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:33.053
And then he probably checked
his experimental results.

00:07:33.053 --> 00:07:34.478
And he tried to repeat it,

00:07:34.478 --> 00:07:35.940
and he checked everything to make sure

00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:37.594
nothing was going wrong,

00:07:37.594 --> 00:07:41.108
and it turned out that, yes,

00:07:41.108 --> 00:07:42.813
something was actually happening.

00:07:42.813 --> 00:07:45.878
This one in 20,000 alpha
particles was real.

00:07:47.388 --> 00:07:48.567
So what did this mean?

00:07:48.567 --> 00:07:52.276
This meant that we needed
a new atomic model.

00:07:52.862 --> 00:07:56.090
We had to explain, somehow,
that a tiny fraction

00:07:56.090 --> 00:07:58.522
of the alpha particles
was getting bounced back.

00:07:59.387 --> 00:08:00.868
So how did he do this?

00:08:00.868 --> 00:08:03.190
He knew there was something in the atom

00:08:03.190 --> 00:08:05.213
that was tiny,

00:08:07.111 --> 00:08:10.722
massive, and positively charged.

00:08:13.133 --> 00:08:15.844
And he knew that it had to be tiny

00:08:15.844 --> 00:08:18.184
because not very many alpha particles

00:08:18.184 --> 00:08:19.949
interacted with it, 'cause most of them

00:08:19.949 --> 00:08:21.551
went straight through.

00:08:21.551 --> 00:08:23.060
He knew that it had to be massive

00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:26.799
and positively charged
because, well, the electrons

00:08:26.799 --> 00:08:30.212
are really small, and
most of the particles

00:08:30.212 --> 00:08:31.396
went straight through.

00:08:31.396 --> 00:08:34.391
So whatever these particles
were interacting with

00:08:34.391 --> 00:08:38.431
had to be very small but really heavy,

00:08:39.081 --> 00:08:41.328
which is how they bounced right back.

00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:43.952
So he made a new

00:08:45.699 --> 00:08:48.490
model of the atom that incorporated

00:08:48.490 --> 00:08:51.266
these requirements.

00:08:53.059 --> 00:08:56.617
And what he said was that

00:08:56.947 --> 00:09:00.670
there must be something in
there with these properties,

00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:03.293
which we now call the nucleus.

00:09:07.037 --> 00:09:08.727
And it's really tiny,

00:09:08.727 --> 00:09:11.782
in fact he was able to
calculate, not exactly.

00:09:11.782 --> 00:09:14.098
He was able to calculate
approximately how big it was

00:09:14.098 --> 00:09:16.564
based on how many alpha particles hit it,

00:09:16.564 --> 00:09:20.001
and he said it was approximately

00:09:20.001 --> 00:09:24.268
1/10,000

00:09:24.848 --> 00:09:27.111
of the volume of the atom.

00:09:28.342 --> 00:09:30.576
And then, what else do we have?

00:09:30.576 --> 00:09:32.991
We know we have this nucleus,
which is positively-charged

00:09:32.991 --> 00:09:34.732
and tiny and massive.

00:09:34.732 --> 00:09:37.142
And then we also have our electrons.

00:09:37.983 --> 00:09:40.514
And then what's the
rest of the atom doing?

00:09:40.514 --> 00:09:43.927
Based on all of this, that
means most of the atom

00:09:43.927 --> 00:09:46.104
is actually empty space.

00:09:49.151 --> 00:09:52.379
Since the electrons are really small

00:09:52.379 --> 00:09:55.536
and the nucleus only takes up

00:09:55.536 --> 00:09:58.647
1/10,000 of the radius,

00:09:58.647 --> 00:10:01.179
the rest of that space
is all just nothing,

00:10:01.179 --> 00:10:04.406
which is kind of crazy, so
based on this particular model

00:10:04.406 --> 00:10:08.067
that Rutherford made next,

00:10:08.067 --> 00:10:10.234
he was able to explain his results.

00:10:10.234 --> 00:10:14.646
He was able to explain that
most of the alpha particles

00:10:14.646 --> 00:10:18.528
just went straight through,
and then every now and then,

00:10:18.528 --> 00:10:23.255
an alpha particle would come
really close to the nucleus,

00:10:23.255 --> 00:10:26.092
and then that would get
defected a little bit,

00:10:26.092 --> 00:10:29.464
and even more rare, an
alpha particle may hit

00:10:29.464 --> 00:10:31.688
a nucleus straight on,
and then it would get

00:10:31.688 --> 00:10:34.062
bounced off because the
nucleus is super-heavy

00:10:34.062 --> 00:10:36.035
and because it is positively charged,

00:10:36.035 --> 00:10:39.153
so it would repel the
positively-charged alpha particle.

00:10:39.153 --> 00:10:41.820
Rutherford called this particular model,

00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:44.305
or we call it now, I'm
not sure which, actually,

00:10:44.305 --> 00:10:47.039
he called it the Nuclear Model.

00:10:50.319 --> 00:10:52.037
This actually looks pretty similar

00:10:52.037 --> 00:10:55.380
to the modern picture of the atom

00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:56.750
that most people think of.

00:10:56.750 --> 00:10:59.304
There's a lot of questions that
are still not answered here,

00:10:59.304 --> 00:11:01.923
like what exactly the electrons are doing.

00:11:02.671 --> 00:11:04.732
Or where are they?

00:11:06.642 --> 00:11:09.239
Where are the electrons?

00:11:10.914 --> 00:11:13.979
But because Rutherford
proposed this new model,

00:11:13.979 --> 00:11:16.463
other scientists were able
to design new expiriments

00:11:16.463 --> 00:11:17.740
to test it.

00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:20.875
And not very long afterward,
we had a pretty good picture

00:11:20.875 --> 00:11:22.152
of what was going on

00:11:22.152 --> 00:11:23.317
on the level of the atom.
