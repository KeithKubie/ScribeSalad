00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:11.070
Well I fully share the sentiments expressed
rather responsibly that it is not the individual

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.670
responsibility of and individual government
to change the world. However I do think that

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:22.380
the world can be changed through a collective
difference. The Obama administration can have

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:32.969
those regards by offering such things as hand
of corporation with the other countries of

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:40.859
the world. What we stand to offer is to being
from a clean slate not to create baggage from

00:00:40.859 --> 00:00:47.710
the Bush administration. And to cooperate
with the rest of the world to find a solution

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:52.920
to the conflict that fills this world. And
to deal with issues of financial crisis that

00:00:52.920 --> 00:01:00.059
is also facing the world today. I think that
if the administration becomes more proactive

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:07.490
and funded it should be possible to bring
about custom changes in this world within

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:08.880
this year 2009.
