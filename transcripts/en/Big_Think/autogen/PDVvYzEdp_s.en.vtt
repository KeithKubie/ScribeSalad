I'll give you an example of what they

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210
I'll give you an example of what they
 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.549
I'll give you an example of what they
start what the variation of the dilemma

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559
start what the variation of the dilemma
 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.970
start what the variation of the dilemma
is imagine that you are a transplant

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980
is imagine that you are a transplant
 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.690

okay so heart lungs whatever whatever
 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.600
okay so heart lungs whatever whatever
okay and they're all going to die if

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610
okay and they're all going to die if
 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.779

different now these are kinds of not

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920
different now these are kinds of not
 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.740
different now these are kinds of not
exactly that but these are kinds of

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750
exactly that but these are kinds of
 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.850
exactly that but these are kinds of
