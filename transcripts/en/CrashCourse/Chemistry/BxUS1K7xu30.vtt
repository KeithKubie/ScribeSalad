00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:06.720
Gas! It's all around you.
It's in space. It's on Mars.

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.160
It's dissolved in your blood, and in your
soda.

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:11.040
It's everywhere.

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.500
And it's easy to forget that we're submerged in an ocean of gas, but it's there all the time.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.900
You can feel it if you wave your arms around.

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.119
Can't look cool while you're feeling it but
you can feel it. It's there.

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.380
Those little molecules and atoms bumping around
against your hands as you wave them around.

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.999
Feel it? Are you doing this?

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:28.859
I've got good news and bad news about gases.

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:31.179
First the good news, when they're behaving
themselves

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:36.599
it is extremely easy to describe their behavior
theoretically, experimentally and mathematically.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.960
The bad news is, they almost never behave
themselves.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:50.820
[Theme Music]

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.440
The first mathematical description of a behavior
of a gas was a link between pressure and volume.

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.519
In a closed system like the inside of this
balloon,

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:03.850
when we decrease the volume of the balloon
the pressure inside goes up.

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:09.090
And if we could somehow expand the balloon,
then the pressure inside the balloon would go down.

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.950
If I keep pushing on it the pressure inside
might go so high that it'll break.

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.340
I hope...I can't do it.
It's a very strong balloon!

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.520
The relationship here is a simple one.

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.990
When you multiply the pressure and volume
together, you get a constant.

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.740
As long as the temperature and amount of gas
stays the same, so does that constant.

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.729
It's called Boyle's Law, and it was a pretty
big deal back in the 1600s.

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:35.770
It's also, one of the greatest scientific
mis-attributions of all time.

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.119
Robert Boyle was a super rich Englishman,
raised in Ireland.

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:44.299
His father was so rich that he paid another
family to raise his children.

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:47.679
I guess because he was too busy administering
lands or something.

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.620
Boyle had lots of great ideas about science
and chemistry.

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.409
His most important one, and this is arguably
even more important than Boyle's Law,

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:58.869
being that chemists should publish papers
not on what they feel is correct,

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:01.909
but rather on theories that have been backed
up by experimentation.

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:07.580
Richard Towneley a wealthy, but considerably less wealthy, Englishman struck up a relationship with Boyle.

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:12.580
Telling him about some of his work that would disprove one of those "But it feels right" kind of chemists.

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.020
Boyle published the paper mentioning that
work, which he called Towneley's Hypothesis.

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:23.360
But which ended up, because of Boyle's superior scientific standing and possibly his wealth, being called Boyle's Law.

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:24.860
But here's the really messed up thing:

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.780
the experiments that led to the creation of
this theory were actually done largely by

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:34.900
Towneley's family friend and physician, Henry Power, who's not a member of the aristocracy at all.

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.660
He was just a working class scientist.

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:41.220
Power was working on a publication that would
have snared him the position as discover of

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.920
the relationship between the pressure and
volume of a gas.

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.420
But Boyle, having discussed the ideas with
Towneley privately, published his first,

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:54.360
attributing Towneley as the sole researcher, ensuring that Power's contributions were all but lost to history.

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:59.400
Henry Power's Wikipedia page didn't even mention
Boyle's Law until a few weeks ago,

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:04.230
when I personally added a paragraph about
it, with proper citations of course.

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.319
But no matter who thought it up or who it
got named after, Boyle's Law is pretty cool.

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:14.000
For a given amount of gas at a constant temperature, pressure times volume always equals the same number.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.320
But where is that constant coming from,

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:20.040
and why is it different for different amounts
of gas at different temperatures?

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.129
Well it was more than a hundred years before
we'd figure out the answer to those questions,

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:30.239
with the help of a Frenchman Jacques Charles and our old, Italian house-elf friend Amedeo Avogadro.

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:33.439
Charles and Avogadro created equations much
like Boyle's law

00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:37.239
with two features of a gas being linked directly
together by constants.

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:40.590
Charles discovered that volume divided by
temperature equals a constant,

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.400
as long as the pressure remains the same.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.810
And then Avogadro figured out that volume
divided by the number of moles in the container

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.700
at a constant pressure and temperature gave
yet another constant.

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:51.239
But here's the crazy cool thing:

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:56.120
all of these scientists were basically dealing
with a different form of the same equation.

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:02.020
An equation that we must never forget, and is gonna be stuck in my head until I die, and here's how it works:

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:07.540
Pressure times volume is equal to the number of moles of substances times a constant times temperature.

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:14.560
P V equals n R T: The Ideal Gas Law, which works for all gases as long as they behave themselves.

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:15.930
Now here's the cool part,

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:20.260
using this equation we can show how all of these chemists were dealing with the same relationship.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.750
They were just clumping various variables
together in different orders.

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:28.630
All of the chemists we just mentioned: Charles, Avogadro and Boyle (or more properly Towneley and Power),

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:31.680
figured out their contribution to the Ideal
Gas Law experimentally.

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.120
But more interesting to me, is that it can
be understood theoretically.

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.320
First, we have to understand what each of
these variables actually mean.

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.060
In that same way the atoms and molecules that
make up gases

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:44.210
are bouncing against things, applying pressure
to them.

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:48.390
This balloon is inflated because the molecules
are bouncing around inside of it,

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:53.330
bumping into the inside of the balloon harder than the molecules bouncing off the outside of the balloon.

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.540
Scientists generally measure pressure with
the S.I. unit of force:

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:00.350
Newtons per area, meters squared, which is
shortened to pascals.

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:03.970
But since pascals are so tiny we either use
kilopascals

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:09.610
or we use the pressure here on earth at sea
level, that we call one atmosphere or one atm.

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:14.950
Completely by chance, one atmosphere is equal
to 101325 pascals,

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:21.180
but that's so close that we often just say that one atmosphere is 100,000 pascals or 100 kilopascals.

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:25.480
Volume is the amount of space particles have
to exist inside of.

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:28.630
So yeah, that makes sense, when the volume
goes down, the pressure goes up,

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:32.520
because there are more particles in a smaller
space, and they'll each hit the walls more often.

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:35.840
N is simply the amount of gas, the number
of moles in the system.

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:41.440
Here I am decreasing the amount of gas in the system and in response the volume is decreasing. Obviously.

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:43.340
But so is the pressure inside the balloon.

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:46.540
R in the Ideal Gas Law is called the Universal
Gas Constant.

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:50.780
Even though, as we will see in a coming episode,
it is neither universal or constant.

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:54.270
It's 8.3145 liters kilopascal per kelvin mole.

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:59.740
Temperature, is experienced by you and me as hot or cold but at the atomic level it's kinetic energy.

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:03.500
Literally, how fast or slow the average particle
is moving.

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:07.520
So if temperature goes up, so will the pressure
as the particles are moving faster

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:10.150
and thus will run into the sides of the container
more often.

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:15.860
So now we know about all of the little bits of the Ideal Gas Law, so let's take a look at it in action.

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:20.500
We here at Crash Course generally like to be very safe. This is a little bit of overkill here.

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:23.860
I put a little bit of water into this soda
can and now I'm boiling it.

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:27.280
So instead of atmosphere gas in this can right
now there's water vapor,

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:29.910
and it's hot and all the molecules are zipping
around like crazy.

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:36.470
We pick it up and we plop it down inside of
that -- ooh! -- and it crushes itself.

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:38.100
So what just happened there?

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:40.180
Well, let's see what the gas law can tell
us.

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:42.240
So which of these things are changing?

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:46.160
Starting on the right hand side: R, is constant,
so that can't change.

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:48.600
The temperature of the gas though, that definitely
changed;

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:51.390
it drops like mad when it's exposed to the
ice water.

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:56.980
N is decreasing too as water vapor is condensing into liquid water, it thus disappears from the gas phase.

00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:59.610
So the next result on the right hand side
is a decrease,

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:02.880
and that means that the left hand side has
to have a decrease too.

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:04.460
So on to the left hand side.

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:09.280
The pressure does indeed drop because the lower temperature makes the molecules move more slowly,

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:12.180
thus bumping into the sides of the can a lot
less than before.

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:15.940
And volume drops too, but not quite for the
reason you might think.

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:20.020
It's really that the pressure inside the can
goes so low, that the pressure outside the can,

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:22.820
the atmospheric pressure, literally crushes
the can.

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:26.030
Now I understand that you probably don't think
this is as cool as I do,

00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:29.790
but understanding the physical reality of
atoms and molecules smacking into things is

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:31.930
a special kind of beautiful for me.

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:37.170
It's also pretty cool that if you know any 3 things about a gas, you can figure out the fourth using the ideal gas law.

00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:39.630
Of course, not all gases behave ideally,

00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:43.800
and all gases deviate from the law at low
temperatures or high pressures.

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:46.280
But we'll save that discussion for a later
episode.

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:47.820
Jargon fun time.

00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:50.410
STP means standard temperature and pressure,

00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:56.980
which according to the lords of chemistry is 0 degrees Celsius and 100,000 pascals or 100 kilopascals.

00:07:56.980 --> 00:08:04.060
One mole of any ideal gas takes up 22.4 liters of space at STP, which is a fact that can simplify a lot of calculations.

00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:08.000
Absolute zero is the temperature at which
all movement of all particles stops.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.500
It is zero kelvins or -273.15 degrees Celsius.

00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:15.940
And that's all for this episode. Thank you
for watching Crash Course Chemistry.

00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:17.640
If you were paying attention you learned about

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:21.880
how the work of some amazing thinkers combined
to produce the Ideal Gas Law;

00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:24.070
how none of those people were Robert Boyle,

00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:29.000
and how the Ideal Gas Equation allows you to find out pressure, volume, temperature or number of moles,

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.160
as long as you know three of those four things.

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:35.340
And you learned a few jargon-y phrases to help you sound like you know what you're talking about.

00:08:35.349 --> 00:08:37.640
This episode of Crash Course Chemistry was
written by me.

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:39.880
The script was edited by Blake de Pastino

00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:43.760
and our chemistry consultants were Dr. Heiko
Langner and Edi Gonzalez.

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:46.650
It was filmed, edited and directed by Nicholas
Jenkins.

00:08:46.650 --> 00:08:50.550
Our script supervisor was Caitlin Hofmeister
and our sound designer is Michael Aranda.
