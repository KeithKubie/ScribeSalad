00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.750
Have you ever looked at the shiny dome of
your grandfather and wondered, “Should I

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:28.920
start stocking up on head wax soon?”

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.800
Statistically at age 30 you will have a 30%
chance of going bald.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.250
This increases by 10% every 10 years.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.200
So someone 50 years old will have a 50% chance
of being bald.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:44.040
Due to the genetic factors involved with baldness,
it stands to reason, if your grandfather is

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.480
bald, you too will have to face that demon.

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.700
Fortunately, scientists have pinpointed the
genes responsible and just might have a cure

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.239
for baldness in the next few years.

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:55.550
Hair loss is simply termed “alopecia”.

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.399
This refers to any type of hair loss no matter
the cause.

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:02.550
There are numerous things that can cause hair
loss, from medical treatments like chemotherapy,

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.510
to scalp infections and stress.

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:07.700
Countless other disease processes can also
result in hair loss.

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:13.100
The type we think of as “male/female pattern
balding” is known as androgenetic alopecia

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:14.840
(AGA).

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.861
This is by far the most common type of balding
and accounts for approximately 90% of all

00:01:18.861 --> 00:01:19.861
male cases.

00:01:19.861 --> 00:01:22.690
It’s also the leading cause of female balding.

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:26.150
Hair, like cells in our bodies, have a growth
cycle.

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:31.820
There are three phases: Anagen- the active
growth stage (80-85% of hair is in this phase);

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:37.240
Catagen- this phase is also known as the transitional
phase, when hair begins to stop growing; and

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.070
telogen- this phase is when hair growth is
completely shut down and the fibers fall out

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.790
(10-15% of our hair is in this phase at any
given time).

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.210
After your hair goes through the Telogen phase,
Anagen begins again and voila!

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:50.210
More hair!

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.770
This cycle repeats itself throughout our lifetimes.

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.890
In the case of AGA, as we age, our hair follicles
begin to shrink.

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:01.770
The result is hair that begins to develop
abnormally causing lighter, finer, and shorter

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:02.770
hairs.

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.409
In the end, the hair falls out, never to return.

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:08.090
They also tend to have shorter Anagen phases.

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.600
There are currently two known pathways that
seem to work together to mediate this process.

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.400
The first is hormonal and has been known about
for decades.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.510
The second was discovered in 2011 and made
public in 2012.

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.260
It involves the genes associated with baldness.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.280
At the base of our hair follicles is a structure
known as the papilla.

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.690
It is in direct contact with blood capillaries
that feed it the essential nutrients for proper

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.440
hair follicle growth.

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.919
These papilla have a large number of receptors
that allow certain hormones to attach to them.

00:02:37.919 --> 00:02:40.500
They are called androgen receptors.

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.490
There is a type of androgen hormone in our
bodies known as Dihydrotestosterone (DHT).

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:50.090
Our bodies make this from the testosterone
that appears in normal blood levels.

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:56.049
When testosterone is aided by an enzyme (type
2 5-alpha reductase) which lies in hair follicle

00:02:56.049 --> 00:03:01.480
oil glands, it turns into DHT and begins to
bind to the androgen receptors.

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.359
Once there, it shrinks the follicle, over
time, causing AGA.

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:10.320
Before 2012, this process was thought to be
the most important pathway to baldness.

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:15.169
In 2012, researchers at the University of
Pennsylvania’s School of Medicine, announced

00:03:15.169 --> 00:03:19.670
that they had found the gene responsible for
male pattern baldness, and as a result think

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.199
this is now the most important path to your
shiny dome.

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:28.730
Known as Prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) it was found
present in abnormally high numbers of bald

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:29.730
scalps.

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.920
There are an array of stem cells present in
every ones’ scalp, both bald and hairy alike.

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.230
These cells get activated throughout our lifetimes
to maintain our hair follicles in good working

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:39.230
order.

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:43.530
The researchers found that stem cell descendants
that actually make up the hair follicles (progenitor

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.870
cells) were diminished in balding men.

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:50.530
The result is hair follicles that become damaged
over time- withering and becoming miniaturized.

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:55.790
After testing for the possible genes responsible,
they found PGD2 was the culprit.

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:58.780
The researchers then came up with an ingenious
idea.

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:03.449
All they would have to do is inhibit PGD2
from activating and your hair follicles should

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:05.639
be able to go on working normally.

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:10.800
They would create a decoy molecule that would
bind to the receptor sites PGD2 did, and thus

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:15.530
get in the way of PGD2 being able to wield
its unfortunate powers.

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:19.340
The good news was there are already numerous
medications in clinical trials that would

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:21.090
inhibit PGD2.

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:25.090
They are being developed for the treatment
of asthma and allergic rhinitis (nasal problems

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:26.090
caused by allergies).

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:30.200
All that needs to be done is to take these
drugs and tweak them to work on balding.

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:34.090
The researchers feel that a drug could be
developed in approximately 2-5 years.

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:39.590
How does the production of the androgen hormone
DHT and the presence of the gene PGD2 work

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:41.470
together to cause baldness?

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:45.910
The exact mechanism isn’t yet known, but
it’s thought that DHT has an upstream control

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:49.090
of making and/or releasing PGD2.

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:54.370
This is because DHT has already been shown
to regulate PGD2 in other tissues.

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:58.170
Until this new, apparent cure, for baldness
reaches the market, we are left with current

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:59.770
methods of treatment.

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:02.350
There is the commonly known topical treatment
Minoxidil.

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:06.460
This drug prolongs the anagen growth phase
of normal hair, and enlarges miniaturized

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:08.540
follicles gradually into normal ones.

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:12.570
This can take up to 12 months and you need
to continue treatment indefinitely.

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:14.520
Once you stop, hair loss will resume.

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:18.970
The bad news is that only 30%-40% of patients
will get the results they want.

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:22.910
Another treatment is the drug Finasteride,
commonly known as Propecia.

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:28.030
This oral drug prohibits testosterone from
converting into DHT, thereby keeping the hair

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:29.030
follicle healthy.

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:32.710
This also can take several months, or even
years to help re-grow hair.

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:36.200
It does, however, appear to work on a majority
of men.

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:39.790
Unfortunately ladies, due to potential side
effects, most doctors don’t want you using

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:40.790
it.

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:43.390
Another more invasive and expensive technique
is surgical.

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:47.610
You can have hair transplanted from areas
with normal growth to areas of baldness.

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:51.630
The techniques have become very refined and
have great success rates.

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:55.920
Bonus Facts:
• The average scalp has 100-150 thousand

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:56.920
hairs.

00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:01.070
Hair is so strong that if you made all of
your hair into a rope, it could hold 10-15

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:06.039
tons or about 3.5 ounces per strand.

00:06:06.039 --> 00:06:08.480
• Hair has the highest rate of cell division
in the body.

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:12.620
It grows at .3mm per day on average, and 1
cm per month.

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:14.560
Thankfully, each hair has its own life cycle.

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:19.630
If it didn’t, instead of losing hair randomly,
we would molt.

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:22.960
• The largest number of hair follicles you
will ever have are present on a developing

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:24.880
fetus by week 22.

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:28.860
The density or thickness of the hair on our
scalp will reduce as we grow.

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:32.700
The reason is because we don’t generate
new follicles during the course of our lives,

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:38.080
and our scalps expand as we age, leaving less
dense hair.

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:41.360
• The anagen (growth phase) of hair is different
for different types of hair.

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:45.650
The hair on your arms, legs, eyelashes, and
eyebrows have shorter active phases ranging

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:47.580
from 30-45 days.

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:51.680
The hair on our scalps have a growth phase
lasting from 2-7 years- thus, longer hair

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:53.990
on your head versus on your arms and legs.

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:57.480
Different people will also have different
lengths of time their hair is in the anagen

00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:58.480
phase.

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:02.270
The result is some people can grow longer
hair than others.

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:07.310
• DHT, while an unfortunate molecule when
it comes to our hair, is actually very useful

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:09.180
in other areas of the male body.

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:12.330
It is required for forming our primary sex
characteristics.

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:16.800
It also helps during puberty to promote muscular
growth, facial and body hair, and helps with

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:31.630
making men’s voices deeper.
