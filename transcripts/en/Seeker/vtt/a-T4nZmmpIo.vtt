00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:04.000
Most actors aren’t real doctors, they just
play one on TV.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:12.370
So should you listen to their medical advice
or get a second opinion?

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:14.710
What up my peeps, Julian here for DNews.

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:16.880
We love famous people, even when we hate them.

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.120
We love looking at them, gossiping about them,
and listening to their advice.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:22.680
Usually that advice is harmless.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.080
Maybe they’re giving you tips on how to
succeed, or for a killer kale salad or something.

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.300
But when that advice affects public health,
should you listen?

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.100
Well, as with most things in life, that’s
a gray area.

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.579
It can go either way.

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:37.219
Like in the case of Angelina Jolie.

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:40.479
In 2013 the actress announced she had had
a double mastectomy in a preventative measure

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:41.910
against breast cancer.

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.519
Genetic testing revealed she had a mutation
of the BRCA1 gene that, according to Jolie,

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:50.170
gave her an 87% chance of developing the disease.

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.600
Some critics panned her decision, either for
being too extreme or lamenting that she would

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:54.620
alter her figure.

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.420
I would like to remind those people that it
is in fact her figure and she can do whatever

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:59.530
she likes with it.

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.639
And it looks like Jolie’s decision has had
a positive impact on public awareness about

00:01:03.639 --> 00:01:04.639
breast cancer.

00:01:04.639 --> 00:01:09.420
Serendipitously the Medical University of
Graz in Austria had just surveyed 1000 women

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.810
about breast cancer treatment options right
before Jolie’s announcement.

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.200
Once the news broke, they decided to survey
1000 women again to see if their knowledge

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.590
on the topic had changed.

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:19.030
And indeed it had.

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.189
The first survey showed 88.9% of women knew
mastectomies were an option.

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.079
That number got a little bump, up to 92.6%
on the second survey.

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:30.230
But the real change was seen in awareness
of treatment options.

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:35.020
The first poll showed 57.6% of women knew
they could have reconstructive surgery using

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.250
their own fatty tissue instead of synthetic
breast implants.

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.100
That number jumped to 68.9% in the second
poll.

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.100
And at first only 40.5% knew reconstruction
could be done at the same time as the mastectomy.

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.100
That number shot up 19% to 59.5% in the second
survey.

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.270
A separate 2014 study in the UK found that
demand for genetic testing for breast cancer

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.369
risk almost doubled after Jolie’s announcement.

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:52.119
The fact that it was Angelina Jolie probably
helped in another way.

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:55.689
As it turns out, people are quite attached
to their body parts, and having them surgically

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:57.439
removed can be a traumatizing thing.

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:02.000
But if Angelina Jolie, a woman of famous beauty,
valued her health more and had the operation,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.560
maybe it’s not so scary after all.

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.590
Celebrity advice isn’t always so helpful
though.

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.920
I knew as soon as I brought this topic up,
many of you were screaming the name “Jenny

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:10.920
McCarthy.”

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.500
I could hear you through your computer screen.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.980
For those that don’t know, Jenny McCarthy
is a model and actress who has become the

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.880
de facto face of the anti-vaccination movement.

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.440
Her son was diagnosed with autism shortly
after receiving vaccinations, she correlated

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.860
the two, and has been on a crusade to keep
parents from vaccinating their children since.

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.700
The thing is, it’s pretty definitive that
vaccines and autism are unrelated.

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.090
Thimerosal, the mercury containing compound
that anti-vaxxers demonize hasn’t been used

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.230
in childhood vaccines since 2001, yet autism
rates continue to climb.

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.250
But you know what vaccines do cause?

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.720
A severe deficiency in measles and mumps.

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.800
And you know what measles and mumps do?

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.430
They kill children, that’s what.

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.210
It looks like the celebrity backed anti-vax
movement has had an impact though.

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:55.120
One study found that when a family has a child
on the autism spectrum, they vaccinate their

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.020
subsequent children by age two 73% of the
time.

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.980
Families with no autistic children vaccinated
by that age 84% of the time.

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.230
The gap had narrowed by age 5, but following
the vaccine schedule is vital to preventing

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:08.230
outbreaks.

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.300
In the end, this particular celebrity and
her message are hurting public health.

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:13.760
Of course these are just two examples.

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.520
This list of celebrity backed campaigns that
affect public health are endless.

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:22.050
Celebrities endorse pet causes that are all
over the map, from gun control to parkinson's

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:24.830
research to HIV prevention to cancer awareness.

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:28.750
But even if they support a good cause, the
information they dole out isn’t always accurate.

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:34.640
Still, according to a 2011 University of Michigan
survey, 24% of people place some value on

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:35.720
a celebrity’s opinion.

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.030
So, what’s the answer to our first question?

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:42.350
Should you trust an unqualified but convincing
stranger that you feel you know and trust?

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:43.910
To be brutally honest, no.

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:45.730
I know that you have the internet.

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:49.730
You can always dig deeper on a topic and have
no excuse to be ignorant.

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:53.480
Always search for new information, avoid the
human tendency for confirmation bias, seek

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:57.980
out expert opinions, and be willing to accept
that what you thought was unshakably right

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:58.980
was wrong.

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:02.160
It’s not easy, but for your health and the
public’s health, it’s the smart thing

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.230
to do.

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:07.770
Public health misconceptions and crazy diet
fads often go together and both of them drive

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:08.850
me insane.

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:13.160
Worse, it looks like health food can make
you fat because the world is a tragically

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:14.180
ironic place.

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:25.440
Matt Lieberman explains here.

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.570
Do you take advice from celebrities or not?

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:28.750
How’s that working out for you?

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:32.850
