00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.120
We often call an encryption
scheme a cipher.

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.920
You may not have realized this,
but encryption has been used for

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:08.800
thousands of years.

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:09.920
For example,

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:15.360
there is an evidence that Ancient
Egyptians used some sort of ciphers.

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.360
And then there is
the famous Caesar's cipher,

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.170
as well as other similar schemes.

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:23.640
There are several types of ciphers.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.630
Symmetric ciphers, range from ancient
schemes to present day algorithms.

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:33.700
Asymmetric ciphers are relatively new,
only invented in the late 70s.

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.130
Most security protocols now
use both types of schemes.

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:42.540
Typically, they first
use asymmetric ciphers

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.250
to authenticate both parties
involved in the communication.

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:51.120
And then establish and exchange
a encryption key for the communication.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.307
Then they use symmetric ciphers, and

00:00:53.307 --> 00:00:57.370
the established encryption key
to encrypt data and traffic.

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:02.200
They can also use asymmetric ciphers
to digitally sign the data, so

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.516
that they can ensure data authenticity.
