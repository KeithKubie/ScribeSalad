00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:04.390
In the last video, we saw
Napoleon's army get decimated,

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:07.080
especially as they tried
to retreat from Russia.

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.640
The numbers I threw out in that
video as he started off

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:15.005
were on the order of 450,000
soldiers under his command.

00:00:15.005 --> 00:00:16.470
And then when he retreated,
it was on the

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.920
order of 10,000 soldiers.

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.230
I just want to take a
little aside here.

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:23.060
These numbers aren't firm.

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:25.470
Historians aren't even sure
on the exact numbers.

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.750
And sometimes you'll see
accounts of 500,000 to 600,000

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:33.550
entering and 30,000
to 40,000 leaving.

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:36.140
I went with these numbers just
because on Minard's map, these

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:37.450
were pretty close to
those numbers.

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:39.540
Right here he has 422,000.

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.140
Leaving he has 10,000
right there.

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.510
But I just want to make sure you
realize that these aren't

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:45.520
exact numbers.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.750
And depending on, I guess, how
you account for his troops,

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.770
whether you're talking about
troops directly under

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:53.060
Napoleon's command, whether
they are troops that are

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:56.460
directly involved in the
offensive invasion of Russia.

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.520
Or they're just troops that
are maybe supporting it.

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:59.760
You're going to get
different numbers.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.290
And depending on whether you
view troops and how you count

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.820
the casualties.

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:05.080
So it's all about
how you count.

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.960
But needless to say, the
French grand army was

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.220
decimated after invading
Russia.

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.630
And I even told you, at the end
of the last video, that

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.220
after that, the rest of Europe,
these other countries

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.080
that kept forming and reforming
coalitions against

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.910
Napoleon, began to
smell blood.

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:28.670
So you can already view the
invasion of Russia as the

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:30.370
beginning of the Sixth
Coalition.

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:32.600
You already had Great Britain.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.620
Great Britain throughout this
entire time period, throughout

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.940
the Napoleonic Wars, and even
during the French Revolution,

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.670
was in a constant state of war
with the French and Napoleon.

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:51.140
Obviously, you have Russia now
is also a belligerent, is also

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.350
an antagonist against
Napoleon.

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.840
Just because he retreated
doesn't mean the war with

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.310
Russia is over.

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.650
Prussia had been humiliated
multiple times by Napoleon.

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:06.560
And now they jump on the
bandwagon after hearing about

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.380
Napoleon getting decimated.

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.000
And so they, a combined Russian
and Prussian forces,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.920
engage Napoleon.

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.040
But as much as Napoleon's forces
seem to have gotten

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.930
decimated--

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.670
So if you look at that Minard
map up here that we went over

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.220
in some detail in the last
video, that covers right here.

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.320
The invasion of Russia started
right about here, and it went

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.460
right about in that direction
right there.

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:33.360
So Napoleon, he's now
retreating back.

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.210
You might say, gee, he
only has 10,000 or

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:36.860
20,000 or 30,000 troops.

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:37.730
That's nothing.

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.490
He's just going to be put out
very quickly by the combined

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:43.300
allied forces.

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.220
But Napoleon, as we kind of say,
regardless of what you

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.270
think of him as a person,
he was no dummy.

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:51.900
And he was good at
raising forces.

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.820
And he was a very, very, very
good military tactition.

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:59.930
He was very quickly able to
raise, to take his 30,000

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.930
soldier army, get
it to 130,000.

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.800
And eventually he's able
to get it to 400,000.

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.380
Although this force right here,
it's not going to be the

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:12.030
same quality of 400,000 as the
400,000 that he might have

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.260
had, say, entering the
Russian campaign.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:15.600
And there were other
troops also that

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:16.890
were allied with Napoleon.

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:19.540
German troops from the
Confederacy of the Rhine that

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.880
were sympathetic to
the French Empire.

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.760
But once again, they weren't
as disciplined or under as

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.230
direct control of Napoleon.

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:31.700
But, it's needless to say, he
was able to very quickly get

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:37.720
up to some reasonable force that
could maybe withstand a

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:38.880
Sixth Coalition.

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.510
But the Sixth Coalition
was much larger.

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:43.370
It's on the order of, depending
on the account you

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:50.480
look at, they amassed forces
mainly in what's now Germany--

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.680
but at that time, the
Confederation of the Rhine.

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.390
And before that, the Holy Roman
Empire-- of on the order

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:59.180
of 1 million troops.

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:00.350
Not $1 million.

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:03.860
One million soldiers.

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:07.360
So even though Napoleon was able
to raise a force, he was

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.620
still out numbered in what's now
Germany, or the Germanic

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.940
kingdoms. He was still out
numbered by a factor of 2:1.

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.940
But despite that, the first
several engagements with the

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.709
combined Russian and Prussian
army, Napoleon was victorious.

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:24.530
Or I shouldn't say victorious,
because that implies too much.

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:26.540
He won those battles.

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:34.080
And these are at Lutzen,
at Bautzen.

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.770
And then at Dresden, he had a
very significant victory.

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:42.270
And these are all right about
here, just so you have a sense

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:43.280
of the geography.

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:46.840
You can actually see Dresden
on the map there.

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:50.820
And after these defeats, the
Coalition said gee, this

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:53.170
Napoleon character, even though
we outnumber him, even

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:56.460
though he had to kind of very
quickly get these troops, he's

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:57.900
a really good military
tactition.

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:01.020
And he's still kind of kicking
our butt on the battlefield.

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:04.140
They then issued what's called
the-- let me write this

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:08.100
down--the Trachtenberg Plan.

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:10.510
Although it's not clear that
they really had to.

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:14.180
The Trachtenberg Plan, which
essentially says, try not to

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:19.230
engage forces that Napoleon
is in command of directly.

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:22.340
Try to engage his people
that Napoleon has

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:23.250
had to delegate to.

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:25.610
His marshalls, the
other generals.

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:31.520
So don't engage Napoleon.

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:34.455
One day I'd like to make more
detailed videos on the actual

00:05:34.455 --> 00:05:38.240
kind of-- you have to say-- the
actual genius of Napoleon

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:39.190
on the battlefield.

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:42.350
And go battle by battle and
see why people consider

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:44.670
Napoleon to be a great
military commander.

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:47.020
But his enemies definitely
appreciated the fact that,

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:51.030
despite being outnumbered, he
was very tricky and very wily,

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:53.930
and was always able
to kind of snatch

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:55.200
victory from the defeat.

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:57.690
So they had this plan, let's
just not engage Napoleon.

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:02.260
We have so many troops, let's
just try to incur losses on

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:06.110
the French on other commanders
other than Napoleon.

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:11.360
But needless to say, they hugely
outnumbered the French.

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:15.750
All of the fighting was
going on in this

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:18.380
general area at the time.

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:21.710
And at Leipzig, and just so
you get a sense of time.

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:26.410
Remember, the invasion of Russia
was at the end of 18--

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:27.550
So let me write this down.

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:36.070
So the Russian invasion-- let
me do this in another color.

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:37.450
Do it right here.

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:48.020
So the Russian invasion, that
was at the end of 1812.

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:50.310
That was really kind of the
beginning of winter in 1812

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:53.660
that really decimated
Napoleon's troops.

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:59.270
Then we go to 1813, you're
looking at Lutzen and Bautzen.

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:09.330
That's in May of 1813.

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:13.140
So after that winter, that gave
Napoleon some time to get

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:14.100
his troops together.

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:15.800
And things happened slower
this day and age.

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:18.260
People didn't have perfect
intelligence in terms of what

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:19.580
was going on in the
battlefield.

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:22.450
And it actually took time for
just information to travel,

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:23.750
and for armies to travel.

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:27.160
They were traveling mainly
on foot at that time.

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:35.850
And then August 1813, you had
Napoleon's significant victory

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:37.100
at Dresden.

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:47.870
But then finally, 1813, in
October-- and at this point

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:51.220
the Coalition had convinced
Austria to also join in.

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:53.360
So this is kind of the
ultimate coalition.

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:55.530
If you look at most of the
coalitions, they seldom had

00:07:55.530 --> 00:07:58.320
bold Austria and Prussia and
Russia and all of these guys.

00:07:58.320 --> 00:07:59.960
But now they're all piling on.

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:01.450
So now you have Austria.

00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:03.250
Austria is part of
the Coalition.

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:05.590
And Sweden.

00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:07.870
And of course, you can't forget
what's happening in the

00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:08.940
Iberian Peninsula.

00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:14.090
You have all of the rebels
in Spain and Portugal.

00:08:14.090 --> 00:08:18.270
So you pretty much have every
major power in Europe is now

00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:20.410
allied against Napoleon.

00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:23.960
And in October of 1813,
especially the Austrians,

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:26.560
Prussians, and Russians, they
meet him at Leipzig.

00:08:30.450 --> 00:08:33.460
Which is right over here.

00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:36.809
And at Leipzig, they
outnumber him 2:1.

00:08:36.809 --> 00:08:38.610
And they were able to
take care of him and

00:08:38.610 --> 00:08:40.480
force him to retreat.

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:43.620
So then Leipzig happens, first
really major defeat.

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:46.350
This is actually an image of
the Battle of Leipzig.

00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:48.230
They call it the Battle
of the Nations.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:58.290
Because so many belligerents
were involved in this battle.

00:08:58.290 --> 00:08:59.410
People estimate that there were

00:08:59.410 --> 00:09:03.810
600,000 soldiers involved.

00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:06.630
400,000 thousand on the side
of the Sixth Coalition.

00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:08.890
200,000 on the side
of Napoleon.

00:09:08.890 --> 00:09:14.020
And they estimate on the order
of a 100,000 dead or wounded.

00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:18.640
So this was a major, major,
super bloody battle.

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:22.430
And it forced Napoleon
to retreat.

00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:23.920
So he had to retreat
from Russia before.

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:26.060
And now he's retreating from
the Confederation of the

00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:28.710
Rhine, Which was essentially
French-controlled territory.

00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:30.500
So Napoleon is really
on his heels.

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:33.070
He now is going to
defend France.

00:09:33.070 --> 00:09:35.160
And now remember, at the same
time as this, you had that you

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:36.940
had all this stuff going
on in the peninsula.

00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:38.870
You had Arthur Wellesley.

00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:40.220
You remember him right here.

00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:48.930
He's the British general
leading, you could view them

00:09:48.930 --> 00:09:52.020
as the rebels in Spain
and Portugal.

00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:55.300
At the end of 1813, he's winning
a series of victories

00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:55.980
against the French.

00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:58.770
And he's pushing into France.

00:09:58.770 --> 00:10:00.520
This is the Pyrenees Mountains
right here.

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:03.350
He's crossing, he's winning
a series of

00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:04.930
battles in the Pyrenees.

00:10:04.930 --> 00:10:06.960
And then in a last-ditch effort,
Napoleon once again,

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:08.220
he's hugely outnumbered.

00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:12.180
He engages his enemies in
battles in northeast France,

00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:13.920
right around that area.

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:17.720
And there's actually a period,
there's this six day campaign.

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:20.660
And this now, we are in 1814.

00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:23.320
So Leipzig was at
the end of 1813.

00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:24.030
He retreats.

00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:26.320
Now we're in 1814.

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:32.080
And at the beginning of 1814 in
February, you have the Six

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:33.330
Day Campaign.

00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:39.910
And this was kind of Napoleon's
final shot at

00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:41.850
really showing his
military genius.

00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:44.800
Despite the fact that he was
hugely outnumbered, there were

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:48.400
four significant battles where
he was essentially able to, at

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:51.790
least in those battles, route
the Coalition, despite being

00:10:51.790 --> 00:10:52.910
hugely outnumbered.

00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:55.780
So he kept showing his
military genius.

00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:59.050
But at some point, the numbers
just became overwhelming.

00:10:59.050 --> 00:11:01.340
And the French troops just
couldn't handle the Coalition,

00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:03.870
especially after being
decimated in Russia.

00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:07.380
And then losing significant
troops even in some of their

00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:10.650
victories in what is now
Germany, or the Confederation

00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:12.120
of the Rhine then.

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:16.920
And then the allies, the
Coalition, eventually in March

00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:25.076
of 1814, the Sixth Coalition,
marches into Paris.

00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:32.270
And this right here is an image
of the Russians marching

00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:43.760
into Paris, around
March of 1814.

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:45.520
But Napoleon didn't
want to give up.

00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:49.360
In April Napoleon is telling
his generals,

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:51.470
let's go retake Paris.

00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:55.940
But finally, the generals are
ready to give up on Napoleon,

00:11:55.940 --> 00:11:57.760
and they refused
to follow him.

00:11:57.760 --> 00:11:59.820
And then Napoleon says hey,
then I'm going to tell the

00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:00.610
troops to follow me.

00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:02.200
And they're like, well you could
try, but they're not

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:03.150
going to follow you.

00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:05.430
So they essentially don't agree
to do anything that

00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:06.630
Napoleon wants.

00:12:06.630 --> 00:12:09.360
Forcing Napoleon, and it was
going to happen one way or the

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:11.870
other, this way was
just less bloody.

00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:16.600
In April of 1814-- super
important time in history--

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:18.700
Napoleon is forced
to abdicate.

00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:28.510
And not only does he abdicate--
maybe I'll do a

00:12:28.510 --> 00:12:31.590
future video on it-- but he also
has to rescind any claim

00:12:31.590 --> 00:12:40.250
that any of his son or any of
his future-- not the word

00:12:40.250 --> 00:12:43.560
ancestors, what's the opposite
of ancestors?

00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:47.210
Descendants, any of his future
descendants might have claim

00:12:47.210 --> 00:12:50.740
as Emperor of France
or King of France.

00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:52.630
So he's forced to abdicate.

00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:54.490
Super important time, 1814.

00:12:54.490 --> 00:12:56.450
So if you think about
when Napoleon ruled.

00:12:56.450 --> 00:13:03.140
Remember, he was able to take
power at the end of 1799.

00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:07.110
So it's been on the order of 13
or 14 years where Napoleon

00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:10.230
has just been the absolute
ruler of France.

00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:12.220
And has been able to really
kind of wreak a

00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:13.360
lot of havoc on Europe.

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:15.370
And now, it all comes
to an end.

00:13:15.370 --> 00:13:16.850
And we'll see, it's kind
of temporary now.

00:13:16.850 --> 00:13:20.720
But we're getting near the end
of hearing about Napoleon.

00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:23.830
They force them to abdicate by
the Treaty of Fontainebleau.

00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:36.590
And they exile him to Elba.

00:13:36.590 --> 00:13:39.060
So this is-- just so you know
where Elba is-- a little

00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:44.140
island off the Italian
coast right here.

00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:46.810
This is where Napoleon
was forced to stay.

00:13:46.810 --> 00:13:49.690
Doesn't seem like that
bad of a place.

00:13:49.690 --> 00:13:51.610
And they actually let him keep
the title of Emperor.

00:13:51.610 --> 00:13:53.000
And they allowed him
to rule over Elba.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.210
And he was actually able to
do something reasonably

00:13:55.210 --> 00:13:56.770
constructive things
with the island.

00:13:56.770 --> 00:13:58.980
You're going to see he leaves
the island very shortly.

00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:01.050
But it wasn't that bad.

00:14:01.050 --> 00:14:04.170
In modern days, if someone was
indirectly responsible, or

00:14:04.170 --> 00:14:06.700
directly responsible, for
butchering millions of your

00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:10.290
civilians or soldiers, you
wouldn't send him to a place

00:14:10.290 --> 00:14:12.250
with a nice climate and give
him a nice house like this.

00:14:12.250 --> 00:14:14.890
And allow them actually
rule over the island.

00:14:14.890 --> 00:14:18.180
But I think at this time, all
of these generals and kings,

00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:21.830
they all viewed each
other as gentlemen.

00:14:21.830 --> 00:14:25.320
And they never wanted to be
too vicious to each other,

00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:28.380
just in case things
were to come back

00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:30.160
around to them, I guess.

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:36.930
But he got exiled to Elba in, as
I just said, April of 1814.

00:14:36.930 --> 00:14:41.000
And then, the Coalition, we'll
talk more about this, they put

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.200
Louis XVI-- you remember Louis
XVI, with the whole French

00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:46.770
Revolution and the
Estates-General-- they put his

00:14:46.770 --> 00:14:49.190
younger brother, they restore
him to the crown.

00:14:49.190 --> 00:14:53.770
This is right here
is Louis XVIII.

00:14:57.410 --> 00:14:59.560
This is Louis XVI's
younger brother.

00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:06.010
They make him King of France.

00:15:06.010 --> 00:15:08.080
So after all that business about
the French Revolution,

00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:10.770
and then Napoleon comes to
power, and all the Rights of

00:15:10.770 --> 00:15:11.840
Man and all that.

00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:13.200
When everything is said
and done, they put a

00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:14.910
king back in power.

00:15:14.910 --> 00:15:16.710
This guy, with the satin
robes again.

00:15:16.710 --> 00:15:19.150
Doesn't look too different
than his older brother.

00:15:19.150 --> 00:15:21.150
And just in case you're
wondering, hid older brother

00:15:21.150 --> 00:15:22.510
is Louis XVI.

00:15:22.510 --> 00:15:24.090
He's Louis XVIII.

00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:25.870
Who was Louis XVII?

00:15:25.870 --> 00:15:28.390
This is Louis XVII.

00:15:28.390 --> 00:15:29.640
Right here.

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:39.560
This is Louis XVI's son, he was
actually next in line to

00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:44.290
the thrown before his uncle,
or Louis XVI's younger

00:15:44.290 --> 00:15:45.770
brother, Louis XVIII.

00:15:45.770 --> 00:15:49.470
But he died while he
was in prison.

00:15:49.470 --> 00:15:51.850
If you were a Royalist, you
would have considered him king

00:15:51.850 --> 00:15:56.250
after the beheading, the
decapitation of his dad.

00:15:56.250 --> 00:15:58.420
And actually, there's a hugely
fascinating story here where

00:15:58.420 --> 00:16:01.300
people say that he
died in 1795.

00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:05.330
But many, many people think that
he escaped and was able

00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:06.340
to live a normal life.

00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:08.220
And who knows what?

00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:10.710
But needless to say, he wasn't
anywhere to be found.

00:16:10.710 --> 00:16:15.140
So they made Louis XVIII-- Louis
XVI's younger brother--

00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:17.050
King of France.

00:16:17.050 --> 00:16:18.250
But, we're going to see,
this isn't the

00:16:18.250 --> 00:16:20.970
last we hear of Napoleon.
