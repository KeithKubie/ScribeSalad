the monies that had come from us would

00:33:00.909 --> 00:33:00.919
the monies that had come from us would
 

00:33:00.919 --> 00:33:02.500
the monies that had come from us would
have been gone into medicine or

have been gone into medicine or
medically related fields they finally

00:33:05.560 --> 00:33:05.570
medically related fields they finally
 

00:33:05.570 --> 00:33:08.919
medically related fields they finally
got it enough to build the chemistry

00:33:08.919 --> 00:33:08.929
got it enough to build the chemistry
 

00:33:08.929 --> 00:33:11.500
got it enough to build the chemistry

case the gift came without restriction
 

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:31.840
case the gift came without restriction
that is on its use and how although they

00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:31.850
that is on its use and how although they
 

00:33:31.850 --> 00:33:34.930
that is on its use and how although they
said it we'd like for it to be endowment

00:33:34.930 --> 00:33:34.940
said it we'd like for it to be endowment
 

00:33:34.940 --> 00:33:37.240
said it we'd like for it to be endowment
they didn't even I don't think there was

00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:37.250
they didn't even I don't think there was
 

00:33:37.250 --> 00:33:41.649
they didn't even I don't think there was
any restriction on that it was um and it

00:33:41.649 --> 00:33:41.659
any restriction on that it was um and it
 

00:33:41.659 --> 00:33:44.529
any restriction on that it was um and it
was for the University and that was a

00:33:44.529 --> 00:33:44.539
was for the University and that was a
 

00:33:44.539 --> 00:33:49.210
was for the University and that was a
godsend because then without you know we

00:33:49.210 --> 00:33:49.220
godsend because then without you know we
 

00:33:49.220 --> 00:33:51.640
godsend because then without you know we
could begin to make plans for the whole

00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:51.650
could begin to make plans for the whole
 

00:33:51.650 --> 00:33:54.789

university not not slighting medicine

00:33:54.789 --> 00:33:54.799
university not not slighting medicine
 

00:33:54.799 --> 00:33:56.710
university not not slighting medicine
but putting it in perspective you know

00:33:56.710 --> 00:33:56.720
but putting it in perspective you know
 

00:33:56.720 --> 00:34:00.279
but putting it in perspective you know
in the total picture the other thing

00:34:00.279 --> 00:34:00.289
in the total picture the other thing
 

00:34:00.289 --> 00:34:03.870
in the total picture the other thing
that happened about that time was the

00:34:03.870 --> 00:34:03.880
that happened about that time was the
 

00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:06.279
that happened about that time was the
the growing conviction that we ought to

00:34:06.279 --> 00:34:06.289
the growing conviction that we ought to
 

00:34:06.289 --> 00:34:11.109
the growing conviction that we ought to
try to sequester the Woodruff fund from

00:34:11.109 --> 00:34:11.119
try to sequester the Woodruff fund from
 

00:34:11.119 --> 00:34:13.359
try to sequester the Woodruff fund from
the general endowment then general

00:34:13.359 --> 00:34:13.369
the general endowment then general
 

00:34:13.369 --> 00:34:14.919
the general endowment then general
endowment when we received it was I

00:34:14.919 --> 00:34:14.929
endowment when we received it was I
 

00:34:14.929 --> 00:34:16.090
endowment when we received it was I
think about a hundred and seventy-five

00:34:16.090 --> 00:34:16.100
think about a hundred and seventy-five
 

00:34:16.100 --> 00:34:21.399
think about a hundred and seventy-five
million dollars so that fund alone was a

00:34:21.399 --> 00:34:21.409
million dollars so that fund alone was a
 

00:34:21.409 --> 00:34:23.200
million dollars so that fund alone was a
forty percent increase of our endowment

00:34:23.200 --> 00:34:23.210
forty percent increase of our endowment
 

00:34:23.210 --> 00:34:26.470
forty percent increase of our endowment
and took us above Duke in Manorville of

00:34:26.470 --> 00:34:26.480
and took us above Duke in Manorville of
 

00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:27.550
and took us above Duke in Manorville of
course there

00:34:27.550 --> 00:34:27.560
course there
 

00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:31.659
course there
whole campaign raised I think 200

00:34:31.659 --> 00:34:31.669
whole campaign raised I think 200
 

00:34:31.669 --> 00:34:34.210
whole campaign raised I think 200
something and so we we really increase

00:34:34.210 --> 00:34:34.220
something and so we we really increase
 

00:34:34.220 --> 00:34:36.040
something and so we we really increase
the endowment considerably more as well

00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:36.050
the endowment considerably more as well
 

00:34:36.050 --> 00:34:38.080
the endowment considerably more as well
as raising money for projects and that

00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:38.090
as raising money for projects and that
 

00:34:38.090 --> 00:34:40.270
as raising money for projects and that
sort of thing but the idea of

00:34:40.270 --> 00:34:40.280
sort of thing but the idea of
 

00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:44.230
sort of thing but the idea of
sequestering the thing was that we

00:34:44.230 --> 00:34:44.240
sequestering the thing was that we
 

00:34:44.240 --> 00:34:46.570
sequestering the thing was that we
wanted to see if we couldn't continue

00:34:46.570 --> 00:34:46.580
wanted to see if we couldn't continue
 

00:34:46.580 --> 00:34:50.379
wanted to see if we couldn't continue
the the power of initiative within the

00:34:50.379 --> 00:34:50.389
the the power of initiative within the

the the power of initiative within the
university once it gets built in to the

university once it gets built in to the
 

00:34:52.610 --> 00:34:57.160
university once it gets built in to the
budget an income stream it its power is

budget an income stream it its power is
 

00:34:57.170 --> 00:35:01.570
budget an income stream it its power is
there but it has no no an additional

impetus into the budget or into the
 

00:35:04.310 --> 00:35:09.840
impetus into the budget or into the
programs and we succeeded in in

00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:09.850
programs and we succeeded in in
 

00:35:09.850 --> 00:35:12.310
programs and we succeeded in in
persuading the trustees honor they've

00:35:12.310 --> 00:35:12.320
persuading the trustees honor they've
 

00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:14.500
persuading the trustees honor they've
won hard to persuade them because they

00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:14.510
won hard to persuade them because they
 

00:35:14.510 --> 00:35:16.810
won hard to persuade them because they
always like to be conservative but it

00:35:16.810 --> 00:35:16.820
always like to be conservative but it
 

00:35:16.820 --> 00:35:20.920
always like to be conservative but it
was a hard grow for the faculty and some

00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:20.930
was a hard grow for the faculty and some
 

00:35:20.930 --> 00:35:22.300
was a hard grow for the faculty and some
of the faculty were extraordinarily

00:35:22.300 --> 00:35:22.310
of the faculty were extraordinarily
 

00:35:22.310 --> 00:35:25.600
of the faculty were extraordinarily
critical of the first few years of our

critical of the first few years of our
 

00:35:25.610 --> 00:35:28.000
critical of the first few years of our
use of the fund because they didn't see

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:28.010
use of the fund because they didn't see
 

00:35:28.010 --> 00:35:32.170

the immediate results in fact some rode

00:35:32.170 --> 00:35:32.180
the immediate results in fact some rode
 

00:35:32.180 --> 00:35:34.470
the immediate results in fact some rode
in the wheel that they thought that

in the wheel that they thought that
 

00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:39.720

somehow was had some sort of chicanery
 

00:35:39.730 --> 00:35:42.220
somehow was had some sort of chicanery
what is incredible

00:35:42.220 --> 00:35:42.230
what is incredible
 

00:35:42.230 --> 00:35:46.300
what is incredible
but in any case in the first working out

00:35:46.300 --> 00:35:46.310
but in any case in the first working out
 

00:35:46.310 --> 00:35:48.640
but in any case in the first working out
of this since we had set up scholarships

call on it was a need for a huge

00:35:58.150 --> 00:35:58.160
call on it was a need for a huge
 

00:35:58.160 --> 00:36:00.400
call on it was a need for a huge
infusion in the Emory college and

infusion in the Emory college and
 

00:36:00.410 --> 00:36:04.420
infusion in the Emory college and
scholarships we just it's hard to

00:36:04.420 --> 00:36:04.430
scholarships we just it's hard to
 

00:36:04.430 --> 00:36:06.190
scholarships we just it's hard to
believe what the scholarship budget was

00:36:06.190 --> 00:36:06.200
believe what the scholarship budget was
 

00:36:06.200 --> 00:36:07.810
believe what the scholarship budget was
when I took over I think it was less

00:36:07.810 --> 00:36:07.820
when I took over I think it was less
 

00:36:07.820 --> 00:36:10.420
when I took over I think it was less
than a million dollars but the whole

00:36:10.420 --> 00:36:10.430
than a million dollars but the whole
 

00:36:10.430 --> 00:36:14.050

dollars I don't remember what we finally

dollars I don't remember what we finally
wound up with but it was a substantial

00:36:30.700 --> 00:36:30.710
wound up with but it was a substantial
 

00:36:30.710 --> 00:36:33.490
wound up with but it was a substantial
amount but we agreed that we would start

00:36:33.490 --> 00:36:33.500
amount but we agreed that we would start
 

00:36:33.500 --> 00:36:35.560
amount but we agreed that we would start
off the first year with that amount and

00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:35.570
off the first year with that amount and
 

00:36:35.570 --> 00:36:38.620
off the first year with that amount and
the next year we would well it would

00:36:38.620 --> 00:36:38.630
the next year we would well it would
 

00:36:38.630 --> 00:36:40.520
the next year we would well it would
grow and then we'd back out

00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:40.530
grow and then we'd back out
 

00:36:40.530 --> 00:36:42.770
grow and then we'd back out
they grow year by year we you know and

00:36:42.770 --> 00:36:42.780
they grow year by year we you know and
 

00:36:42.780 --> 00:36:44.420
they grow year by year we you know and
come in with the freshmen and so forth

00:36:44.420 --> 00:36:44.430
come in with the freshmen and so forth
 

00:36:44.430 --> 00:36:46.820
come in with the freshmen and so forth
but then after four years we'd begin to

00:36:46.820 --> 00:36:46.830
but then after four years we'd begin to
 

00:36:46.830 --> 00:36:50.630
but then after four years we'd begin to
back it out and we did and the college

00:36:50.630 --> 00:36:50.640
back it out and we did and the college
 

00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:53.150

their budget well the point of all this

00:36:55.430 --> 00:36:55.440
their budget well the point of all this
 

00:36:55.440 --> 00:37:00.770
their budget well the point of all this
was to try to leave at least 50% of they

that we could do matching things and

00:37:07.190 --> 00:37:07.200
that we could do matching things and
 

00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:09.890
that we could do matching things and
pull back and so forth and I think that

00:37:09.890 --> 00:37:09.900
pull back and so forth and I think that
 

00:37:09.900 --> 00:37:11.960

worked for a long time I know that I

foreclosed kind of maturation and I
 

00:50:45.610 --> 00:50:48.250
foreclosed kind of maturation and I
think that was the gap go back to the

00:50:48.250 --> 00:50:48.260
think that was the gap go back to the
 

00:50:48.260 --> 00:50:51.790
think that was the gap go back to the
earlier point between my ideal of a

00:50:51.790 --> 00:50:51.800
earlier point between my ideal of a
 

00:50:51.800 --> 00:50:55.060
earlier point between my ideal of a
community where really there was a lot

00:50:55.060 --> 00:50:55.070
community where really there was a lot
 

00:50:55.070 --> 00:50:56.440
community where really there was a lot
shared in common and we had

00:50:56.440 --> 00:50:56.450
shared in common and we had
 

00:50:56.450 --> 00:50:58.660
shared in common and we had
cross-disciplinary conversation and the

00:50:58.660 --> 00:50:58.670
cross-disciplinary conversation and the
 

00:50:58.670 --> 00:51:01.450
cross-disciplinary conversation and the
students were involved in thing and the

00:51:01.450 --> 00:51:01.460
students were involved in thing and the
 

00:51:01.460 --> 00:51:05.080
students were involved in thing and the
reality of modern wort life and I think

00:51:05.080 --> 00:51:05.090
reality of modern wort life and I think
 

00:51:05.090 --> 00:51:08.730
reality of modern wort life and I think
that tension exists you know wherever I

00:51:08.730 --> 00:51:08.740
that tension exists you know wherever I
 

00:51:08.740 --> 00:51:12.730
that tension exists you know wherever I
think the importance is to maintain that

think the importance is to maintain that
 

00:51:12.740 --> 00:51:15.820
think the importance is to maintain that
tension and the same thing is on the

00:51:15.820 --> 00:51:15.830
tension and the same thing is on the
 

00:51:15.830 --> 00:51:18.460
tension and the same thing is on the
campuses where the tension is lost and

00:51:18.460 --> 00:51:18.470
campuses where the tension is lost and
 

00:51:18.470 --> 00:51:22.120
campuses where the tension is lost and

00:51:22.130 --> 00:51:25.189
it just simply has given over to
specialization and and the society's

00:51:25.189 --> 00:51:25.199
