DANIEL SIEBERG: Hi there,
I'm Daniel Sieberg in

00:00:05.366 --> 00:00:07.130
the Google TV booth.

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:10.120
And I am en-Thuuz-iastically
talking

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.240
with Brandon and Jordan.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.290
Brandon, tell us who you are and
what Thuuz is all about.

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:16.642
BRANDON FIELDS: All right.

00:00:16.642 --> 00:00:18.450
I'm a software engineer
with Thuuz.

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:21.860
And Thuuz is a sports
application.

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:25.930
And it's all about finding an
exciting game to watch because

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:30.315
in today's TV land there's just
tons of games to watch at

00:00:30.315 --> 00:00:31.990
any particular time.

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:35.380
So we try to make it easy for
a user to find the most

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:36.860
exciting games.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:37.220
DANIEL SIEBERG: Cool.

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:42.730
So Jordan, you're going to help
us out by kind of driving

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:43.500
the action here.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.190
JORDAN TOOR: I can do that.

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.490
DANIEL SIEBERG: So give us sort
of a run through Brandon

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:47.340
of what we're seeing as Jordan's
controlling things.

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:47.710
JORDAN TOOR: Sure.

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.810
So Thuuz is enabling discovery
of exciting games.

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:54.520
This is our home screen
for the Google TV app.

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.180
It's currently showing that my
personalized sports-- there's

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.240
two live games going
on right now.

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.720
So we're going to go ahead
and jump into here.

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.010
This is personalized to my
favorite sports and my

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:05.670
favorite teams.

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.160
You can see here in the middle
we have two live games going

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:09.685
on right now, the Dodgers
and the Giants.

00:01:09.685 --> 00:01:13.520
You can see earlier today, games
off to the left with

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.185
more exciting games
ranked to the top.

00:01:16.185 --> 00:01:16.750
DANIEL SIEBERG: What do those
numbers reference to?

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:19.570
BRANDON FIELDS: Those are
excitement ratings that we

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.340
come up with based on an
algorithm that computes

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.870
several factors based on pace
of the game, novelty of the

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:29.940
plays, rivalry of the
teams, big come

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:31.790
backs, things like that.

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:34.290
Hundreds of factors go
into making a number

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.020
between 0 and 100.

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.100
100 being the best game ever.

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.310
So I mean if you could imagine
the Giants perfect game a week

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.990
or two ago, that was 100
on our Thuuz scale.

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.110
So here we have the
Giants game.

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:49.750
Let's just go ahead and
go into here and

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:51.070
see what we've got.

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.660
This is 3-0 Dodgers.

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:55.520
This is our excitement graph
throughout the different

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.100
innings of the game.

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:02.220
We try to propagate where you
can actually watch the game.

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.740
So we're working closely
with Dish Network.

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.100
So we can actually tune into
this game right now, or we can

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.670
actually choose to record
this game to our DVR.

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.340
DANIEL SIEBERG: So for rights
purposes, we don't want to get

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.990
in trouble.

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:15.850
So we're not showing any of that
stuff, but of course you

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.120
could have the game on while
you're doing all this stuff

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.730
and see it at the same time.

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:19.250
BRANDON FIELDS: Correct.

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.960
Correct.

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.100
And we try to make it really
easy, just one click, switch

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:23.890
to the channel.

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.400
We also give you summary and
stats and online resources

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.800
where you can actually catch
highlights, condensed video,

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:33.695
things like that.

00:02:33.695 --> 00:02:35.360
DANIEL SIEBERG: Now I see the
Friends tab up at the top.

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:36.690
What's that all about?

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.320
BRANDON FIELDS: So we recently
added some social features.

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:43.270
So instead of commenting on a
game or sharing a game, we

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:44.760
call it Thuuzing a game.

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.660
So Google's a verb.

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.610
We're trying to make
Thuuz a verb.

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:51.020
DANIEL SIEBERG: So you get a
certain number of Thuuzes.

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:52.690
BRANDON FIELDS: Yeah, so here
we got a couple people that

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.850
have Thuuzed this particular
game already today.

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:00.710
And that's basically what
Friends is all about, going

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:03.130
out and finding your friends so
you could follow them, and

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:04.730
you guys can have conversations

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.360
about exciting games.

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:07.074
DANIEL SIEBERG: Cool.

00:03:07.074 --> 00:03:08.466
JORDAN TOOR: Hop over
to DVR here?

00:03:08.466 --> 00:03:11.360
BRANDON FIELDS: Yeah, let's
actually hop over to the DVR.

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.660
So one exciting feature we
worked on really hard

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.740
specifically for Google I/O is
integrating with the Dish box.

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:22.890
So what we're doing here is
we're making automated rules

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:24.970
based on your personal
preferences, maybe it's your

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.360
favorite team, maybe it's
a favorite sports

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:28.390
league that you like.

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:31.370
But we'll automatically go out
and record the game to your

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:34.230
DVR for you, the app will.

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:35.590
All you have to do
is set up a rule.

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.250
So you can see here, we're
really into Euro

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:39.030
soccer right now.

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:44.440
So we have a rule set up to
record all the European games.

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.520
We're really Giants fans, so
we've set a high priority that

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:49.140
we're going to go ahead
and record every

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:50.390
single Giants game.

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:53.980
Or you can use our algorithm to
say, hey, when some other

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.992
game I might not know about gets
really exciting, go ahead

00:03:56.992 --> 00:03:59.030
and record it to
my DVR for me.

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.620
DANIEL SIEBERG: It's
very cool.

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.720
So it's almost thinking
for you in a sense.

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:04.250
It's taking all the hassle out
of figuring out which games

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:06.770
are on, which ones might
I like, all that stuff.

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:07.440
It's happening at
the same time.

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:07.820
BRANDON FIELDS: Yeah.

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:10.490
So it's all about discovering
games that maybe you might not

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:12.050
have known about.

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:14.060
DANIEL SIEBERG: Just real quick,
any sort of advice for

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.630
developers out there looking
at Google TV as a platform,

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:18.863
things you've learned, lessons
you want to pass along?

00:04:18.863 --> 00:04:19.610
BRANDON FIELDS: For sure.

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:23.720
I mean there's definitely the
mindset of a 10-foot UI.

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.050
It's a bigger screen.

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.220
Your users are going to be
sitting further away from it.

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:32.290
So you gotta leverage the
layouts to handle that.

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:37.790
There's integration with the
tuners with whatever your

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:41.370
cable box is, a TiVo,
a Dish, a DIRECTV.

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:43.510
Being able to change the channel
right then and there

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:45.810
is a pretty cool.

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:49.270
Integrating with DVR
to automatically

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:50.520
record things is--

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.060
DANIEL SIEBERG: Well this
is awesome stuff.

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:54.720
I'm a big hockey fan so I'm
excited for when, of course,

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.400
NHL gets back in action.

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:57.690
But guys, thank you so much.

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:59.660
Brandon and Jordan we
appreciate this

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:01.170
little tour of Thuuz.

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:01.810
BRANDON FIELDS: Thank
you so much.

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:03.300
DANIEL SIEBERG: All
right thanks guys.

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:04.550
We're going to move on here.

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:09.190
You know, I am a
huge poker fan.

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:12.250
And I hear that there's an
awesome Zynga poker game.

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:14.030
And here we are with Zynga
to talk about it.

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:14.470
What a coincidence.

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:16.580
And I'm joined by
Jen and Andrew.

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:19.190
So Jen, tell me what Zynga
Poker is all about.

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:21.465
And I notice you've got multiple
devices here as well.

00:05:21.465 --> 00:05:21.790
JEN HERMAN: Yep.

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:24.330
So Zynga Poker is Zynga's
first game.

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:26.730
It was created back in 2007.

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:28.520
It was first created
on the PC.

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:30.300
And we've since launched
the game on mobile

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:31.510
across multiple platforms.

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:34.170
So we started on Android mobile
phones and then moved

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:34.790
to tablets.

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:37.650
And most recently we've
moved to Google TV.

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:40.620
So it's pretty exciting for us
to support all of these great

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:43.270
Android devices.

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:47.840
And with Google TV one of the
things that we can do is we

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:50.580
can play in a five-
or nine-person

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:52.130
tournament at a table.

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:55.340
And Andrew is going to give you
a demo of how that works.

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:55.840
So let's check that out.

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:56.040
DANIEL SIEBERG: OK.

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:58.980
Andrew go for it card shark.

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:00.740
ANDREW LEONIDAS: Well, I'm on
the main game table right now,

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:05.500
and in a moment you're going to
see how we've been able to

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:09.030
optimize our layout for the
various Android devices and

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:12.040
platforms that are currently
on offer.

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:15.980
Right now we're looking at the
Google TV version, which we've

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:22.330
developed for the TV DPI
density, which coincidentally

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:26.080
is exceptionally close
to the new

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:28.785
seven-inch Nexus 7 densities.

00:06:28.785 --> 00:06:29.080
DANIEL SIEBERG: It looks
gorgeous, yeah.

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.763
ANDREW LEONIDAS: So
it's a direct port

00:06:31.763 --> 00:06:35.990
of our Nexus 7 version.

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:40.230
I can log in with my Zynga
Poker account.

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:42.440
All my chips are there
across platforms.

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:44.990
All my friends are there.

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:47.200
I'm losing pretty
badly right now.

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:48.200
Most of my stack's
already gone.

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:49.860
DANIEL SIEBERG: It's hard to
talk and play at the same time

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:51.210
and hold a microphone.

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:53.360
ANDREW LEONIDAS: Yeah, I made a
bit of a rookie error whilst

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:55.720
I was navigating
the microphone.

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:56.140
DANIEL SIEBERG: That's
all right.

00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:57.570
So you folded with those
pair of aces.

00:06:57.570 --> 00:06:58.890
That's all right.

00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:02.240
So Jen, you've got a Nexus
7 in your hand right?

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:02.501
JEN HERMAN: Yeah.

00:07:02.501 --> 00:07:05.080
So just to talk about
this a little bit.

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:07.330
One of the things that as we
build our games for the

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:10.330
Android platform we use a
multi APK so that we can

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:14.550
support all of these different
formats with a single SKU.

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:19.280
And, as you know, we could
distribute our same game for

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:23.130
the tablet and for the phone
and for Google TV within

00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:23.710
Google Play.

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:26.130
So it's great as a publisher
to be able to

00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:28.190
do that in one place.

00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:29.820
DANIEL SIEBERG: Can you show us
the experience on here too?

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:30.210
JEN HERMAN: Yeah.

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:32.100
So what we're going to do--

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:33.490
I've got the tablet here.

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:35.140
And one of the things that we've
done-- what's really

00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:38.170
important for Zynga as a company
is that playing Zynga

00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:39.800
games is a social experience.

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:41.640
So you want to be able to play
with your friends and your

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:43.250
family no matter
where they are.

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:46.880
But what's really cool on the
Android phone and tablet now,

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:49.730
we've been able to integrate
beam technology so that you

00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:51.510
can play with whoever's
nearby.

00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:54.570
So we're going to show you
how to do that right now.

00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:58.140
Andrew is going to bust
out his Galaxy

00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:01.610
phone, and we are gonna--

00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:02.860
ANDREW LEONIDAS: All right,
let's take a look.

00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:07.510
DANIEL SIEBERG: So can you hold
these up to the camera

00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:09.920
just a bit so we can see what
the experience is like?

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:14.170
ANDREW LEONIDAS: So if I'm
joined to a table, or if I'm

00:08:14.170 --> 00:08:18.760
simply watching a game, and I
have a friend nearby who also

00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:23.160
has a beam-enabled
device, I can--

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:24.790
if all goes correctly--

00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:29.986
place the rear of my device
against hers--

00:08:29.986 --> 00:08:31.350
JEN HERMAN: And then
I touched a beam.

00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:32.137
DANIEL SIEBERG: Just touched
a beam there

00:08:32.137 --> 00:08:33.419
on the screen, yeah.

00:08:33.419 --> 00:08:35.380
JEN HERMAN: And my game's
starting up.

00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:37.166
DANIEL SIEBERG: So now you're
joining the same game that

00:08:37.166 --> 00:08:37.880
Andrew's in, right?

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:38.530
JEN HERMAN: Yep.

00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:40.490
ANDREW LEONIDAS: And
now we're joined.

00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:43.130
JEN HERMAN: And I can spectate
or I can play.

00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:44.790
So I was just chose to
spectate while I

00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:47.030
watch Andrew over here.

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:51.510
DANIEL SIEBERG: Who's a
better player here?

00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:53.120
I have to--

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:54.900
ANDREW LEONIDAS: I think
Jen has a bigger stack

00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:55.760
than me right now.

00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:59.020
But I'm going to
take this one.

00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:00.340
DANIEL SIEBERG: All right, well
anything else you guys

00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:02.250
wanted to mention while
you're in [INAUDIBLE]?

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:04.930
JEN HERMAN: We wanted to show
you a little bit on this new

00:09:04.930 --> 00:09:06.310
Nexus 7 tablet.

00:09:06.310 --> 00:09:08.360
So some of the things that we've
done that we think are

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:10.820
great on the device are we've
really tried to implement

00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:12.420
fragments and really
take advantage

00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:13.970
of the tablet device.

00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:16.210
It's such a beautiful screen,
and we love it.

00:09:16.210 --> 00:09:18.200
So a couple other things--

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:20.440
so where we would normally have
multiple screens that you

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:23.110
would go to, we've actually
implemented fragments here so

00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:25.190
that you can see in a drop down
some of the other screens

00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:26.880
that you would have to jump
around and navigate.

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:31.280
So we think that really being
able to take advantage of the

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:35.020
high-density screen and the
mobility of this form factor

00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:36.550
is really going to
be great for game

00:09:36.550 --> 00:09:37.690
players and poker players.

00:09:37.690 --> 00:09:38.790
DANIEL SIEBERG: Very cool.

00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:39.240
Well, I can't wait
to check it out.

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:40.390
I've got to get my hands
on one of these

00:09:40.390 --> 00:09:40.950
Nexus 7's at some point.

00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:42.290
JEN HERMAN: Yeah, we want to
see you at a table soon.

00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:44.730
Get some chips from you.

00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:45.780
DANIEL SIEBERG: And I'll take
some chips from Andrew.

00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:47.350
All right, Jen and Andrew
from Zynga.

00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:49.180
Thank you guys, we
appreciate it.

00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:50.510
All right, I'm going to head
off to the next one.

00:09:50.510 --> 00:09:51.385
We'll see you guys later.

00:09:51.385 --> 00:09:52.600
JEN HERMAN: Bye bye.

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:53.540
DANIEL SIEBERG: All right.

00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:56.080
On our third stop of this
trifecta at Google TV, we're

00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:59.570
joined by Ken from iHeart Radio
Now iHeart Radio, as a

00:09:59.570 --> 00:10:01.810
lot of folks will know, has
been around for a while.

00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:05.060
But as an app for Google TV it's
only been about a month.

00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:05.680
How--

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:09.700
or is it-- different than what
people are used to and walk me

00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:11.370
through some of the different
features.

00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:11.730
KEN COLTON: All right.

00:10:11.730 --> 00:10:14.160
So first of all it's really
exciting to get to work in a

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:15.860
brand new platform
like Google TV.

00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:18.310
And we have so much screen real
estate to take advantage

00:10:18.310 --> 00:10:20.030
of to really display
our content in new

00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:21.710
and interesting ways.

00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:24.430
So you still have access to
all of our great radio

00:10:24.430 --> 00:10:26.000
stations in custom radio.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.220
And we're just going to display
it in a really visual

00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:28.930
and interesting way.

00:10:28.930 --> 00:10:30.190
DANIEL SIEBERG: Right, I
see more pictures here.

00:10:30.190 --> 00:10:32.470
Of course, just as you say, you
have more real estate to

00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:33.610
display all that stuff.

00:10:33.610 --> 00:10:36.000
Now walk me through some of the
buttons that we can see on

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.900
the left there and how people
can interact with

00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:39.970
it using the remote.

00:10:39.970 --> 00:10:40.360
KEN COLTON: All right.

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:43.380
We divided everything into
Find, Create, and Search.

00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:46.720
And Find lets you go and find
live stations near you or live

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:48.180
stations by genre.

00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:50.810
Create lets you create your own
custom radio stations by

00:10:50.810 --> 00:10:53.470
just typing in an artist or a
song, and it will choose other

00:10:53.470 --> 00:10:56.360
songs that are like that song
and continue to play that.

00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:57.540
Search, you can search
for anything.

00:10:57.540 --> 00:10:59.500
It will find all the content
in our library for you.

00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:01.630
DANIEL SIEBERG: And how many
lives stations are out there

00:11:01.630 --> 00:11:02.450
these days?

00:11:02.450 --> 00:11:04.800
KEN COLTON: So we have over
1,000 live stations.

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:07.280
And we have custom stations
that can be made from over

00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:10.370
400,000 artists or over
10 million songs.

00:11:10.370 --> 00:11:10.700
DANIEL SIEBERG: OK.

00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:10.940
Cool.

00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:13.950
Well, give us a demonstration of
what it's like to listen to

00:11:13.950 --> 00:11:15.460
a song here on Google TV.

00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:15.516
KEN COLTON: All right.

00:11:15.516 --> 00:11:16.900
So I can just go over
to my Now Playing

00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:18.890
section and hit Play.

00:11:18.890 --> 00:11:20.110
And I'll play that guy.

00:11:20.110 --> 00:11:22.650
And it'll just start
playing songs.

00:11:22.650 --> 00:11:25.000
And you have this gorgeous
album art display.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.650
And it will show you what radio
station you're listening

00:11:27.650 --> 00:11:30.170
to and just great to
leave up on the TV.

00:11:30.170 --> 00:11:31.170
DANIEL SIEBERG: All right, so
we're only going to play about

00:11:31.170 --> 00:11:33.060
10 or 15 seconds, just
for rights purposes.

00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:35.880
But of course, if you were at
home on the comfort of your

00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:38.340
couch you could listen to
whatever you want to or during

00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:40.780
a party or however you
want to display it.

00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:43.120
Tell me a little bit about that
development process for

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:44.390
Google TV, what it was like.

00:11:44.390 --> 00:11:45.800
You're on the development
team yourself?

00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:46.120
KEN COLTON: Yes.

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:47.470
DANIEL SIEBERG: And I know it
happened in a fairly short

00:11:47.470 --> 00:11:47.900
amount of time.

00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:48.300
KEN COLTON: Yes.

00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:52.170
So we decided to build this as
an HTML5 web application, and

00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:54.740
it wound up in the Google TV
spotlight that showcases web

00:11:54.740 --> 00:11:57.160
applications that are optimized
for Google TV.

00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:00.640
And by choosing HTML5 as our
technology, we were able to

00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:03.540
build this application with a
team of only three people is

00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:06.560
just one month and really come
up with the best user

00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:08.840
experience by iterating
quickly.

00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:12.300
DANIEL SIEBERG: Any advice for
other development teams out

00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:15.150
there looking at Google TV,
whether they have an existing

00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:18.280
app already or they're looking
to maximize it for this

00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:18.780
experience?

00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:21.940
I know earlier we talked about
real estate and just thinking

00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:23.925
about that versus maybe
a smaller screen.

00:12:23.925 --> 00:12:25.880
KEN COLTON: Yeah, you definitely
want to customize

00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:27.130
your app for the
TV experience.

00:12:27.130 --> 00:12:29.400
And if you really focus on that
and don't be afraid to

00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:30.790
push the envelope, you
can come up with a

00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:32.090
really awesome app.

00:12:32.090 --> 00:12:33.200
DANIEL SIEBERG: Were you
guys testing it out

00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:34.285
on a TV this size?

00:12:34.285 --> 00:12:40.300
I mean, is this the ideal place
for you to test out

00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:41.130
something like this?

00:12:41.130 --> 00:12:43.670
KEN COLTON: Well, we started
designing for a TV this size.

00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:45.860
But one of the challenges of
building interface is making

00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:47.720
sure that it works
for smaller TVs.

00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:50.900
So we designed an interface
that's easy to use at a large

00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:52.090
size like this and
looks great.

00:12:52.090 --> 00:12:54.420
But it's also just as functional
on a smaller size.

00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:56.940
DANIEL SIEBERG: And in terms
of sharing your choices or

00:12:56.940 --> 00:13:00.210
something, that sort of social
element to it, how is that

00:13:00.210 --> 00:13:01.795
part of this Google TV app?

00:13:01.795 --> 00:13:02.940
KEN COLTON: The social
is deeply

00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:04.560
integrated into iHeart Radio.

00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:06.710
We have the ability to share
what you're listening to to

00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:10.350
Facebook and invite other people
to try custom stations

00:13:10.350 --> 00:13:11.750
that you created.

00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:13.400
DANIEL SIEBERG: Very cool.

00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:16.630
Can you tell me what's coming
down the pike with this,

00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:18.620
anything you're looking at as
a road map to the future?

00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:20.560
DANIEL SIEBERG: Well, we're
looking to just really build

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:24.310
out this Now Playing screen by
showing information about

00:13:24.310 --> 00:13:27.160
artists from Twitter or any
other real-time information

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:29.840
that we have just to make this
Now Playing experience as

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:30.860
awesome as possible.

00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:34.170
As well as just rolling out new
stations and new features

00:13:34.170 --> 00:13:36.010
that are available on
our other platforms.

00:13:36.010 --> 00:13:36.480
DANIEL SIEBERG: Very cool.

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:39.570
So take me back to that main
screen if you can.

00:13:39.570 --> 00:13:41.050
And that Me, what's
that down there?

00:13:41.050 --> 00:13:42.370
Is that a profile of your
own preferences?

00:13:42.370 --> 00:13:44.860
KEN COLTON: So this shows you
all of the stations that

00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:46.890
you've created and all of the
songs that you've liked.

00:13:46.890 --> 00:13:49.380
So I can go in and see the
stations that I've created and

00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:52.000
very quickly jump back into
those stations and start

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:52.570
playing them.

00:13:52.570 --> 00:13:53.650
DANIEL SIEBERG: So it's
like your own personal

00:13:53.650 --> 00:13:54.265
history sort of thing.

00:13:54.265 --> 00:13:54.560
KEN COLTON: Yeah.

00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:57.020
And this persists across
all of our platforms.

00:13:57.020 --> 00:14:00.240
So you can start listening to
station on your Android device

00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:02.460
and then pick it up here
and just go right back.

00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:03.950
It'll be right at the top, and
you can start playing again.

00:14:03.950 --> 00:14:04.850
DANIEL SIEBERG: Oh, that's
a great point.

00:14:04.850 --> 00:14:08.350
So if you're an iHeart Radio
user and you start listening

00:14:08.350 --> 00:14:10.160
to something on the TV or
you've created your
