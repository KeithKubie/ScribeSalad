00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.080
Move over Bigfoot!

00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:02.590
There’s a new ‘foot’ in town!

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:06.439
His name may be Little Foot, but the questions
surrounding this skeleton are anything but

00:00:06.439 --> 00:00:11.500
little!

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.470
Hey everyone - Natalia here, guest hosting
for DNews.

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:20.100
Understanding human origins has been a preoccupation
with humans since...well, since we originated.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.560
And since the discovery 41 years ago in East
Africa of a 3.2 million year old female hominin

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.670
named Lucy, AKA Australopithecus afarensis,
paleoanthropologists have discovered several

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:32.160
new hominin species.

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.990
A hominin is one of our upright walking ancestors.

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:40.620
One such possible new species includes specimen
StW 573, or Little Foot.

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.620
Little Foot was first discovered in the early
1990s in concrete-like material called breccia

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.870
in South Africa’s Sterkfontein Caves.

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:53.250
Sterkfontein has also yielded the remains
of Australopithecus africanus, a species of

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.790
hominin that lived 2-3 million years ago.

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:59.440
Therefore, there was question whether Little
Foot is simply another A. africanus individual

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.190
or perhaps a new species altogether!

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.650
Researchers have spent over 20- yes 20- years
excavating Little Foot!

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.110
During this time they tried to determine his
age and species.

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.290
Fortunately, his head is well preserved and
exhibits traits that differ from A. africanus,

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.869
such as larger cheek teeth, a longer, flatter
face, and slight sagittal crest, or a bony

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.540
ridge along the top of the head.

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.420
And, as you may have guessed...little feet.

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.060
Scientists also have worked hard to determine
the age of Little Foot and even employed a

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.550
new technique to estimate how long ago Little
Foot’s little feet walked the earth.

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:36.190
According to researchers Little Foot died
3.7 million years ago making him a lot older

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:41.600
than all other A. africanus individuals AND
a contemporary of Lucy’s species A. afarensis,

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.640
which lived from 3.9 to 2.9 million years
ago.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.420
Hence Little Foot has been dubbed a new species,
Australopithecus prometheus!

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.280
According to researchers this development
would imply that there could have been a link

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:57.440
between Australopithecines in East and South
Africa which is incredibly exciting!

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:02.120
However, despite researcher assertions that
Little Foot is a new species that lived 3.7

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.590
million years ago, there are those that disagree.

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.390
Hey, it’s not science unless there’s a
debate!

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.560
There are scientists that argue Little Foot
is younger than 3.7 million years old.

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.280
And there is question if A. prometheus is
a new species or he is just another A. africanus

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.950
individual that falls within the range of
variability within that species.

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.560
When it comes to human evolution there are
two camps; lumpers and splitters.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.650
Lumpers are conservative about dividing species
into multiple taxa.

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.440
Whereas splitters are liberal with their degree
of speciation.

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.341
For example, since it’s discovery, Homo
ergaster had been considered it’s own species

00:02:34.341 --> 00:02:38.819
but now it’s commonly lumped in with Homo
erectus rather than split the two into separate

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:39.849
taxa.

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:44.110
Or they refer to Homo ergaster as a subspecies
of Homo erectus.

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:47.930
If you think about it, the morphology, or
the anatomical structure of an organism, can

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.020
greatly vary within a species.

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:53.740
Look at our own species- we come in all sorts
of shapes and sizes.

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:55.280
Or better yet-dog breeds!

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.190
It’s hard to believe a chihuahua and an
English Bulldog are the same species...but

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:00.190
they are!

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:05.200
Like many paleoanthropological discoveries
drawing the line between species, is complicated

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.959
since researchers rarely have multiple fully-intact,
pristine skeletons to work with.

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:12.430
Funny enough, Little Foot’s new name is
from Greek mythology.

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.760
Prometheus was the Titan who stole fire from
the gods and delivered it to humankind.

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.730
Perhaps, Little Foot will live up to his new
name by igniting some heated, yet inspired,

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.300
debates about the origins of humankind.

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:26.870
So ladies and gents, I have feeling there’s
going to be more news about our pal Little

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:28.349
Foot.

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:30.870
Paleoanthropologists will surely continue
discussing his age and whether or not he’s

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:31.870
a new species.

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:37.129
And this is a perfect example that science
is not static; it’s constantly evolving

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:39.060
as new information is discovered.

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.000
So what do you think - is Little Foot a new
species or not?
