00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.899
 in this capsule we will see how we 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:08.820
 makes prediction in a hlm 

00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:11.910
 so let's imagine now that we have 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.219
 observed a sequence of s1 until is 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.109
 small and and consults now do 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:19.220
 a prediction of what would be the 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:22.470
 value of the hidden state in cause a spa 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:24.930
 which follows so it's a problem of 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.570
 prediction ie a calculation and the 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.300
 hidden metal distribution in caussens 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.040
 star moment in the future given 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.070
 a sequence that was observed until one 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.290
 time t given when we go to see what we 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.550
 is going to be able to use the 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.870
 table at a time that we calculated 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.770
 previously as well as a procedure 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.420
 additional dynamic programming 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:49.260
 to do these few others in a 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:51.329
 hlm so what we will do is that 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:55.320
 now your kidneys another painting 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:58.140
 we're going to call pi and pouilly body goes 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:02.609
 match our calculation of the 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:04.860
 probability that htk is equal to 1 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:07.080
 given all that we observed 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.400
 until now the sequence of care 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.390
 up to st 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:14.100
 we know that our definition of pi as 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.689
 usually we will define a recursion 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:20.100
 so now we want to make the link 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:23.070
 between probability like hans 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:26.310
 capricious moment in the future for 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.770
 the state hide and galleries we want to link 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.290
 with what we calculated but for 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:35.280
 the instant coop that still remain in 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:37.049
 the future then by definition then he 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.110
 so began galas politics 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:42.119
 buy coop the saint and galleries and 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.210
 alanis we watched until tentz 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.649
 so it's the same thing here 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.369
 the only difference is that we copied the 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.060
 evening at the case place is a little 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.500
 commented 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.159
 until now what are we going to do 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:02:00.689
 we will add the variable 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:03.180
 as much buy as much or at the moment t + 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:05.460
 coop but we see the marginalize 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.710
 since when if it is not 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:11.489
 observed in one's interest 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.830
 pleasant oda p2 buy more buy 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:15.160
 more coop the Sinhalese 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.600
 given at 5 o'clock until the moment t 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:20.600
 so we incorporate in enjoy but we 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:23.210
 the marginalized here and there we will try 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:25.910
 to appear worse by separating the 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:29.960
 probability between buying more coop the 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.410
 breast is bought + so we go 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:33.700
 to start 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:37.700
 we go there conditional only on 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:39.890
 buy more than is equal to knowing 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.900
 all classified when you're here now 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:45.920
 we can multiply by politics 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:48.760
 buy more than one at 10 am 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:51.890
 to buy more score is even acts 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:54.470
 normally here are made the rule of 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:57.170
 shenaz standards normal we would have more 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:03:01.280
 here to the right of the bar 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:04.070
 we draw an equal 1 to stay here 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.200
 is 1 until pull galaxy s 2 1 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:08.750
 until t but we have dependencies 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:12.740
 conditional if we know buy more 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:15.170
 that we do not need to know that she 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:17.090
 is the observation until the attempted 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:19.580
 determine the probability of the state 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:22.310
 hidden at the moment t + cops 1 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:27.580
 so that's because in a hlm one 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:31.430
 was going h who are here and so 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:34.040
 imagine that my sequence observe 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:36.410
 find children here I might have 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:41.060
 others it's other sequences 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:44.239
 observed here and imagine that that in 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:46.970
 this case would be to be equal 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:50.269
 to 2 so that would mean that it is 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:52.489
 here it would be bought more than at 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:53.150
 will finish here their mark if I 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:55.940
 observed 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:59.090
 but all the paths between buying more 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:59.810
 as more healthy would be blocked by 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:02.420
 the UNOCI 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:05.300
 so all the paths between the other s 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:08.150
 observe and buy more capuchins are 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:09.680
 blocked by the knot here if we observe 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.660
 what is the case here we condition 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:14.200
 on it so we have conditional independence 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:16.489
 so we do not need to incorporate it 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.720
 So here we are, we use the years 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:19.269
 by conditional lens in a cellar 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:23.270
 even to allow us to write again 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:25.880
 then as healthier as being 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:27.560
 finish here but we notice this 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:31.640
 probability if it fits in 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:34.760
 made our definition of kiji case on 

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:37.190
 act here then we have like here so 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:41.419
 actually cpie gic so finally I have 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:43.490
 be misc on the left column but 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:44.510
 we are weighted by these probabilities of one here 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:47.060
 what are the priorities to make a 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:49.280
 gland state transition equal to gilles 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:51.770
 varin and cash &amp; carry in leicester 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:53.930
 next then we do the sum so on 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:59.120
 all possible paths of the state 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:05:01.250
 hide i finally have to 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:05.150
 of a signaling then by our 

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:08.210
 definition of phi phi phi 01 used to 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:08.930
 cost equal zero that would correspond to the 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:11.240
 convenient 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:13.010
 ht is equal to 6 knowing all the 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.810
 sequence and that in fact we can 

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:17.560
 calculate from due to once we have 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:20.330
 previously calculated 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:22.070
 indeed the probity to buy 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:23.990
 galleries sacha the entire sequence has 

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:27.919
 observed until like it's 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:30.950
 simply the lf was divided by the 

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:33.349
 sum on the column in the table of 

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:37.940
 half so actually we mark so 

00:05:33.349 --> 00:05:39.500
 it's actually a probability of 

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:40.880
 filtering and we know that we can 

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:42.770
 calculate with alfa so it's just 

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:47.479
 sure that we use here to initialize 

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:49.430
 our painting then is something that 

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:51.110
 could maybe a little bit more 

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:54.530
 interesting it's actually rather than 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:56.000
 predict the hidden state buy more body 

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:58.940
 we could perhaps see predy that is 

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:02.270
 what we will observe in just a moment 

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:03.890
 in the future and from the tracks 

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:04.490
 possible to do it also with the formula 

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:06.620
 we see here 

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:10.460
 so in fact this probability one can 

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:13.130
 write it as the probability that I 

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:15.050
 be the cash rates and as much you are 

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:17.660
 more like being the whole year the 

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:21.890
 sequence observed times the productive 

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:23.440
 i'm watching s since i have i'm 

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:26.140
 went hide yourself 

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:27.880
 that my state hide it's equal acts and 

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:30.700
 the now I make the sum arises 

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:33.480
 so I marginalized arisen so we're at 

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:37.570
 equality here and we notice that term 

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:39.190
 actually corresponds to the array which then to 

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:42.250
 from pawns could also make a 

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:43.750
 prediction not just to hide them 

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:49.330
 but also of what is expected 

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:51.390
 observe in a future moment then 

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:54.490
 let's do an example again with 

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:58.270
 our simple example of a raw channel and 

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:59.890
 where we pass the bits so we have a 

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:03.190
 message we received from 4 bits 

00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:05.290
 in all and one is interested in knowing 

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:08.890
 what would be the pipe that would like to 

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:12.850
 excess transmitted in classical dance to 

00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:15.070
 equal 2 in the future that gives both 

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:16.120
 a moment in the future then the 

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:18.190
 first thing we do is we 

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:21.460
 use our alpha chart that I have 

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:22.960
 reproduced here and we will use it with 

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:25.540
 the initialization condition we have 

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:33.550
 here to initialize the first column 

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:35.890
 of our table which here so that's 

00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:37.750
 just written explicitly what 

00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:39.550
 the formula is to take 

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:41.530
 each of the elements here and then the 

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:47.910
 normalize by the sum on the column 

00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:53.310
 and then fill it in here so we get 

00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:58.660
 10.060 7.1 for the first element 0.9 

00:07:53.310 --> 00:08:02.440
 2009 for the second and then his 

00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:04.360
 apply our recursion as the formula 

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:06.790
 which is repeated here so I take my 

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:08.800
 Previous maccarone elements 

00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:11.560
 I multiply them by the probabilities of 

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:13.720
 transition of a winter floor the state y that 

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:16.510
 I'm interested but I'm counting on 

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:19.419
 all possible values ​​of the state to 

00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:25.060
 the previous moment to get the 

00:08:19.419 --> 00:08:28.240
 parities at the next moment so resumed 

00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:31.479
 0.1 it corresponds to take then 0-0 

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:34.900
 times the pole t2 be zero then of 

00:08:31.479 --> 00:08:36.329
 go to 0 + ppi 0.1 

00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:40.139
 forgiveness in 

00:08:36.329 --> 00:08:42.629
 oh and times the probability of being at 

00:08:40.139 --> 00:08:47.309
 state 1 then to pick up at 

00:08:42.629 --> 00:08:52.040
 the zero state the next moment I 

00:08:47.309 --> 00:08:55.139
 replace then it gives me 0.5 7.8 7.9 

00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:57.239
 I do the same thing for the second 

00:08:55.139 --> 00:09:00.629
 step so that's going to give me the 

00:08:57.239 --> 00:09:01.920
 probability that h5 equals a time 

00:09:00.629 --> 00:09:04.049
 the animal sequence observe a 

00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:06.389
 prediction for hosting galleys 

00:09:04.049 --> 00:09:08.399
 in a moment my future 

00:09:06.389 --> 00:09:10.860
 so I take pleasure in the heroes I 

00:09:08.399 --> 00:09:12.899
 multiplies by the politi of being at 0 

00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:17.819
 then 2 to arrive at one at the moment 

00:09:12.899 --> 00:09:21.059
 next and then plus 1 0 for the 

00:09:17.819 --> 00:09:25.230
 policy of being at a well to stay at 

00:09:21.059 --> 00:09:32.399
 1 as following I replace by 

00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:35.249
 hippolyte and that gives me 0.42 and I 

00:09:32.399 --> 00:09:37.079
 just continue like that to the state that 

00:09:35.249 --> 00:09:39.569
 I'm interested in what if I want to go 

00:09:37.079 --> 00:09:41.189
 until there are two moments in the 

00:09:39.569 --> 00:09:44.129
 future that was the problem I had 

00:09:41.189 --> 00:09:46.019
 posed initially so in fact does not 

00:09:44.129 --> 00:09:50.999
 was just another column to 

00:09:46.019 --> 00:09:52.769
 calculate what was done here is the 

00:09:50.999 --> 00:09:54.329
 value entered in the table 

00:09:52.769 --> 00:09:55.649
 exactly what I want 

00:09:54.329 --> 00:09:58.169
 so if I want to know what is it 

00:09:55.649 --> 00:09:59.160
 policy to this one be zero 

00:09:58.169 --> 00:10:02.160
 when I entered it in my 

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:04.319
 initial problem given the four 

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:07.709
 first beats I received that 

00:10:04.319 --> 00:10:10.860
 corresponds to the element of the array then to 

00:10:07.709 --> 00:10:14.579
 the position 0 2 and so that's 

00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:17.639
 certainly here too and it's a 

00:10:14.579 --> 00:10:20.429
 priority which is equal to 0 point 4 2 6 3 

00:10:17.639 --> 00:10:23.959
 this way there to make a prediction 

00:10:20.429 --> 00:10:23.959
 in a diagram
