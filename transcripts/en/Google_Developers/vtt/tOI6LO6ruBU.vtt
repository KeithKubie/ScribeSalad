TIMOTHY JORDAN:
This is I/O Live.

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:08.840
I'm Timothy Jordan.

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:10.835
And I'm at the community lounge.

00:00:10.835 --> 00:00:13.860
This is where anybody can swing
by and meet up with old friends

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:14.880
or make new ones.

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.520
I'm going to go find some
certification alumni to talk

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.390
to them about the program.

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.890
Hey, Maria.

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:24.880
Hi, everyone.

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:25.464
How you doing?

00:00:25.464 --> 00:00:26.379
SPEAKER 1: Doing good.

00:00:26.379 --> 00:00:27.080
How are you?

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:28.370
SPEAKER 2: Awesome.

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:29.660
SPEAKER 3: Really Great.

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:30.010
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Ha ha.

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:32.229
I'm sitting here with
[? Henry, ?] [? Ashesh, ?]

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:35.950
and [? Somia. ?] And they're
all alumni in the certification

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:36.579
program.

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:38.870
I'd like to ask you just a
few things about the program

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:39.504
if that's OK.

00:00:39.504 --> 00:00:40.170
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:40.330
Sure.

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:42.788
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Let's start
with, how did you get involved?

00:00:42.788 --> 00:00:44.320
What made you want
to get certified?

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.560
SPEAKER 1: So actually
before in Indonesia, they

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:50.590
have a scholarship.

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:53.470
So they give out the 500
scholarship for the people

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:56.410
to take with the [INAUDIBLE]
and certifications.

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:59.680
And I register on that one.

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.550
And I got it.

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.120
And then after that, I
tried certifications.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:05.620
And yeah--

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:07.703
TIMOTHY JORDAN: So your
path was from scholarships

00:01:07.703 --> 00:01:08.740
to certification.

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:09.532
SPEAKER 1: Yes.

00:01:09.532 --> 00:01:10.740
TIMOTHY JORDAN: [? Ashesh? ?]

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.940
SPEAKER 2: OK, so if
you see the reason

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:14.800
I went for the certification.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.380
In our professional life,
we strive for few things.

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.520
One of them is to prove
the worth to ourselves.

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.340
And second is to prove
our worth to others.

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.360
So to proving worth to
ourselves we go for a benchmark.

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:29.780
We try to achieve it.

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.710
So for me, that certification
was a benchmark,

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.120
a milestone achieved.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.453
And once I have achieved that
there is only one way that

00:01:35.453 --> 00:01:36.910
is to go for something higher.

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:37.540
Right?

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.330
So this is one reason to
prove myself, the worth,

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.440
so that I can go for
more higher things.

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.730
So certification was
a commitment to me,

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:48.310
to myself, to go far in
search of more knowledge.

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.080
And second thing is to
prove worth to others.

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.840
So if you saw even
you go for the job,

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.330
there are various phases.

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:56.380
There are interviews.

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:57.671
There are tests and everything.

00:01:57.671 --> 00:02:01.020
But the first phase is
always the qualification.

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.350
What degrees do you hold?

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.150
What certifications do you hold?

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.540
If you don't cross that
door, there's no point.

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.100
I mean, you might be a very
good programmer or something.

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.720
But if you don't have the
initial key to that door--

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.030
so to have a certification,
you are always

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.140
have a key to open a door.

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.190
So that was the other thing
which I went certification for.

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.027
So in short, to gain
confidence and to be job ready.

00:02:25.027 --> 00:02:26.110
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Thank you.

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:27.490
And [? Somia? ?]

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:31.000
SPEAKER 3: So I've been
working on Android since 2010.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.120
So it's been eight years now
with Android as a developer.

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.260
I started with Android 1.6.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.840
And I've done various
application in Android

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:40.930
at different levels.

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.386
Play Store based
applications, a lot

00:02:43.386 --> 00:02:45.260
of enterprise applications
in the last three,

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.640
four years, and
things like that.

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.970
But I think what
was the pusher, what

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.900
pushed me to do the
certification was probably

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:53.590
that--

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.160
you know like [? Ashesh ?]
said, there's a benchmark

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.350
or there's a standard
with the certification.

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:01.810
And after working for
so long in Android,

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.880
worked on various
kinds of applications,

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.704
how do you differentiate
yourself from the others.

00:03:06.704 --> 00:03:08.120
That was a
differentiation factor.

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.474
So I remember about
two years back, there

00:03:10.474 --> 00:03:11.890
was a conference
in Google where I

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:13.570
asked about the certification.

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:16.310
And they said, yes, we are going
to roll out the program soon.

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:19.570
And so I registered with
the community groups.

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:20.890
And I got the email.

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.370
So I was more than
happy to try it.

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:25.845
It actually is already--

00:03:25.845 --> 00:03:29.020
what do you see here, 360 degree
view on what your experience

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:30.630
is, a certification.

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.340
It judges you on a lot
of skills, not just

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:34.510
one core skill.

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.940
You need to talk.

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.820
360 degrees of your skills
are being mapped there.

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:42.940
So that was a great way
to get that done actually.

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:44.230
So that's how I got into it.

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:46.537
And I'm happy that
I achieved it also.

00:03:46.537 --> 00:03:47.620
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Thank you.

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.160
Can each tell me one thing
that has been helpful

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.494
in your career because
of certification?

00:03:53.494 --> 00:03:54.160
SPEAKER 3: Sure.

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.640
So actually in my
current organization,

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.470
we now have a team of
about 20 mobile developers,

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:02.820
mobile team more or less.

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:07.870
And what I noticed was we had
the support of the management

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:10.510
for conducting various
certifications and things

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:11.390
like that.

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:13.030
But when we did
the certification,

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:15.340
and I told my team
that see, I did this.

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:16.120
And it was cool.

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.010
And it gave a
validation to the team

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:20.779
also that how we're doing this.

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:23.797
And after that, very quickly, we
have almost 10 team members now

00:04:23.797 --> 00:04:24.880
who are certified already.

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.407
So that was a big boost,
energizer to them too.

00:04:28.407 --> 00:04:30.490
You know, from a team lead
to the rest of the team

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:31.989
saying that, oh,
you should do this.

00:04:31.989 --> 00:04:34.336
And then that has worked out
very positively for them.

00:04:34.336 --> 00:04:36.460
SPEAKER 2: So we had to
talk to them about exposing

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:37.870
our internal APIs.

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:40.360
And then our boss
had to survey them.

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:43.360
So this was the one
thing which motivated--

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:48.730
like when I was getting
into Android, at that point

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:51.310
in time, I thought, OK, I
will try to make the Android

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:53.530
app in-house for my company.

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:55.670
But the certification
was not there.

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:58.390
So I was also a little
hesitant to ask my boss

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:00.790
to give this job to
me because the app

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:03.620
matters are such financially.

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:05.530
But once I got
the certification,

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:08.240
and I told my boss, he
was very happy about it.

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.360
And of course he
was quite confident.

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:13.840
So now I have developed two
Android apps for my company

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:14.860
in-house.

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:17.330
So we have more
control over the apps,

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:18.950
especially since
I'm working already.

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:20.800
I know the back-end
and everything.

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.410
And our consumers also
get something more robust

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:25.710
and something more
user friendly.

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:27.620
So the certification
helped me to gain

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:31.730
the confidence of my boss and
to move my career in Android app

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:32.840
development.

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:37.160
SPEAKER 1: Before I took
the certifications whenever

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:40.980
I applied to a company, I always
chose the Android app developer

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:42.140
job.

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:45.010
And then they always give me the
interview for an iOS developer

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:47.180
job.

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:49.610
Then I try the certifications.

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:53.960
And then after I get
certified, it naturally

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:56.350
just knocked them
to their senses

00:05:56.350 --> 00:06:00.360
that, OK, I'm
certified by Google.

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.600
So then they gave
me more chances.

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:04.820
They gave me chances for
the interview, for the test.

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:05.695
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Yeah.

00:06:05.695 --> 00:06:07.790
SPEAKER 1: Otherwise
before, they just

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:08.860
gave me the test for iOS.

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:11.360
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Thank you all
so much for sharing your story

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:11.943
with me today.

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:16.490
