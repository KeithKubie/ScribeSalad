00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.879
 Do you know what my cat wants to promote now? 

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:06.330
 A series of youth and consequences, which is now on YouTube red 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.740
 You can register for a 30 day free trial. 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:12.750
 I was thinking about recently 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:15.030
 How my friends are inspiring 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.060
 I want to be you when bigger. one day 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:31.590
 My friendships have become a source of inspiration and support in my life for me. Especially my friends 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.319
 I am surrounded by women who have motivation 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:36.010
 Compassion and intelligence 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:43.530
 I am very grateful for their knowledge. All I have the opportunity to see them feel reassured and calm 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:48.280
 I'm always 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:54.300
 I was surprised when they broke up and for a while I was addressing them about the subject so "Oh girl stop talking this way. 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:56.550
 You are an amazing artist 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.010
 It is difficult for people to resist and you are funny and beautiful 

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:01.469
 Haha thanks 

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:03.190
 Hmmm " 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:04.199
 This did not meet the point 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.759
 I mean this is normal. I would find it a mockery too. Because your friends will definitely support you 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.339
 Because they are your friends, they will laugh at you and tell you how amazing you are 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:16.470
 That is why a new approach has been taken ... "It also seems that the spiritual twin will either be his balance 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.310
 Or Pisces or Cancer Choose a Libra You do not want another water tower. 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.920
 Cancer and Pisces are water towers? I did not know this 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.660
 I am a failure because I know this thing 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:31.400
 Do not say this way with my girlfriend stop this. This is very aggressive 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.529
 After the experiment I found that this approach works because something is about this approach 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:40.559
 Re-frame the way you talk to yourself and remind you that you will not accept that a friend talks to you this way 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.590
 Why do you accept this talk from yourself? 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:46.919
 And it's also very enjoyable. Especially when your friend is on the other side of the room 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:53.519
 "Ah, I do not know why I became a writer everything I write is very bad stop telling this about my girlfriend" 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.560
 Or when they do not know that you have heard what they are saying 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.960
 "I'm so ugly that you stop saying this about my girlfriend" 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:06.640
 Or even if they think about it, "Why do I bother from the beginning, all my views are stupid 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.000
 Stop saying this about my girlfriend " 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:14.280
 So, if your amazing talented friend breaks himself, be a good friend and defend them 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.500
 Against themselves 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.020
 Especially against themselves. As we're talking about it, thanks to my friend Ana for being in the video today 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.839
 She is not only an excellent dancer, she is also a comedian and water colors artist 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:32.899
