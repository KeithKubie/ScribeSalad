00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.630
- [Lecturer] In the last video,
we were able to construct

00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:07.210
here in red this long-run
average total cost curve

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:09.760
based on connecting the minimum points

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.630
or the bottoms of the U's

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:15.430
of our various short-run
average total cost curves.

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:19.010
Each of those short-run
average total cost curves

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:22.910
were based on a certain
amount of fixed cost

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:24.840
in the short run, but in the long run,

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.280
you can change your fixed costs.

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.140
And here are fixed costs
with the number of trucks.

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.610
And so, we can vary it to optimize

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:32.760
for a certain amount of quantity.

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:35.460
Now when we did that, you
could see a little trend here

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.680
especially as we go up
to, the way I drew it,

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.440
it wouldn't necessarily be up to 200

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.740
or whatever you're producing,
but the way I drew it,

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:44.851
you see that this part right over here,

00:00:44.851 --> 00:00:49.851
it looks like our long-run
average total cost curve

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:52.230
is declining down.

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.630
So, one way to think about it is,

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:57.020
we are getting more and more efficient

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.130
at producing our tacos in the long run

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:04.080
as we product more of them
until we get to 200 tacos.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.060
And so, at this part of our curve,

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.483
we are experiencing economies of scale.

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.760
And we've talked about
where economies of scale

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:16.670
can come from.

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.670
It can come from specialization
of labor or even machines.

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:24.213
Specialization.

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.710
So, as you get more and more scale,

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.170
you can have different
parts of your process

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.410
specializing in making the taco shells

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:36.750
or grating the cheese or cooking the meat,

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:37.760
whatever it is.

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:39.300
So, there is a specialization.

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.010
You could get better at sourcing.

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:45.450
So, as you get more scale,
you might be able to order

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.340
more of your supplies at a
time, so you get better deals.

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:49.990
You might be able to even,
who knows, at some point,

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.720
start a farm yourself and
then cut out the middleman,

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.800
and so forth and so on.

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.640
Now as we get past that point,

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.060
we see that our long-run
average total cost curve,

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.750
at least in this example,
started to trend up.

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.670
And so, this part of the curve,

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.470
you could say that we are experiencing

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.650
diseconomies of scale.

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:10.400
Diseconomies

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.370
of scale.

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.920
So, what would cause
diseconomies of scale?

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.620
Well, these would most typically happen

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.530
because what are known
as coordination issues.

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.100
As an organization grows,
you have more people,

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.420
more resources that
you have to coordinate.

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.480
And so, that complexity can sometimes make

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.450
an organization more inefficient.

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.620
There's other diseconomies of scale.

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.510
At some very large scale,
you might be depleting

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.740
all of the low-hanging
fruit of your inputs,

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:41.510
and so, you have to pay more
for some of your inputs.

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:43.450
Maybe you've already depleted
the people who are willing

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.820
to work for less, so
you have to raise wages,

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:47.920
or you've depleted a lot
of the resources you need,

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.560
so you have to find new,
more expensive resources.

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.940
Now in this curve, it's not as obvious,

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.110
but you can also have a notion
of constant returns to scale.

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.760
So, if we had a long-run
average total cost curve

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.593
that looked something like
this, let me draw it over here,

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.290
then in this section right over here,

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:12.630
as the average total cost, the
long-run average total cost

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:16.570
is going down, that would
be economies of scale.

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:17.810
This section over here,

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.880
as the long-run average
total cost is going up,

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.060
that would be our diseconomies of scale.

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.540
But this section over
here where it is constant,

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.250
you might guess what that is called.

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.970
That is called constant economies of scale

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:33.910
or constant returns to scale,

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.563
sometimes known as efficient scale.
