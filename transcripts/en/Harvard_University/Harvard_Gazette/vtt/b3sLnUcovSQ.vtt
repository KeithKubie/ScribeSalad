00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:27.220
Since I got back from combat I've I
spent seven years trying to fix myself

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:35.860
and bury everything and tell me nothing
was wrong. Since starting my treatment

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:43.690
about three, I say, three years ago I have
thought I've gotten better I've seen a

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:51.550
lot of improvement. I will step back from
the treatment but I've never fully

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:57.460
stopped the treatment because I see the
progress and things are getting easier. I

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:05.740
can go out in public again
I can be in a crowd I'm able to go do

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:07.460
things with my children now.

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.660
It was a struggle every day to get up, you know, to

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:19.100
go to sleep, you know, I have a service
dog. Five years ago, even two years

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:25.240
ago, somebody cut me off on the
Expressway coming to Boston; me, if I

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:31.860
didn't chase him down and throw a finger
or... That was the norm.

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.660
I was in the Air Force for one month shy of 15 years

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.540
I had two combat deployments, Iraq in '05

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.380
and Afghanistan in '07 both
with army units as a ground medic

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.400
there's a lot of guilt

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.220
all of the

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:58.640
guys that didn't come home that were
under my care I was holding in and

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.220
blaming myself for

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.180
and carrying that
with you for a couple years

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:11.600
a lot of stronger emotions that stem
from

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.920
hating yourself for

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
not being better

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:27.000
I was medivacked out of Iraq in May of
'03 after I spent '01 and '02 in

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:35.440
Afghanistan right after 9/11. They
discharged me in January of '04 and I

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.490
hadn't gone back to work at the Navy for
like six months. I was a lieutenant

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:43.630
commander and I just disappeared off the
face of the earth

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:47.740
I was married, kids, you know, we ended up
moving up into the middle of the mountains

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:50.950
up in Seattle, near Seattle, Washington, up in the Cascades

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.840
you know, it was basically a place to run
to and hide.

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:11.340
One of the ways that we

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.680
hope that veterans and the family
members eventually will be able to

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.820
express themselves in a way that works
for them is through making a song which

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.940
we're calling collaborative songwriting
so it's both the process of making the

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:26.530
song with a songwriter as well as the
process of listening to the song that we

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:32.140
really hope will help veterans express
themselves and think about and process

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.740
their thoughts and feelings and
behaviors in a way but they may not have

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:36.360
done before.

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:44.720
Probably one of the most emotional... 
emotionally draining and

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:51.220
I would even say was almost physically and
mentally draining as well, experiences

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:59.020
over that a couple hours that I sat with
Jim and came up with a song which was

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:03.740
hard to believe and it was all about
telling the story.

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:05.020
The writer that I

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:10.300
worked with definitely was very easy to
talk to

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:16.390
I forgot that I was talking about myself
at parts and it definitely helped break

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:22.720
down some of the walls when you're
working with a counselor you tend to

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:27.520
keep some walls up because you're always
afraid of giving too much information

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:33.200
when he was writing the song the walls
came down because I just wanted to

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:35.120
finish the song

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:40.220
There's a real power to
some of those songs because they were

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:46.500
written by someone that lived that
powerful experience

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:47.100
I'll tell you for

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:50.660
the first week it was pretty goddamn
difficult listening to that without

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:56.010
crying, you know, I'd shared it with my family, my

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:08.340
wife, my children, I want to say it's
definitely opened their eyes as to kind

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:11.940
of giving them an inkling of what I've
been through

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:19.020
especially, you know, my kids, you know,
they're 12, 14, and 15 and I feel like I

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:28.620
missed the whole first 10 years of their
life and in the song I thought, you know,

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:35.140
my kids will never know what I was like
before all of this.

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:50.419
I was actually listening
to it twice most days when I started

00:05:50.419 --> 00:05:55.310
getting frustrated, put the song on and
it kind of grounded me

00:05:55.310 --> 00:06:00.590
it made me think of traffic sucks, I'm
gonna get through it, my day can get

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:04.009
better from there.
When I listen to it quiet at home at

00:06:04.009 --> 00:06:07.419
night, hey I'm dealing with this problem today

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:14.820
tomorrow's a new day. It served as an
inspiration to remind me of the path I'm on

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:32.480
This study was really to see, does
collaborative songwriting help veterans

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:35.900
we didn't really ask the question what
is it about collaborative songwriting

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:40.910
that helps them to feel better so we
essentially gave everyone a Fitbit and

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:45.440
we tracked both their physiological
outcomes such as heart rate number of

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:49.820
steps and sleep quality as well
psychological outcomes at the beginning

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:52.699
of the study and at the end of the study. We're really lucky to be in this

00:06:52.699 --> 00:06:56.870
environment through Harvard Medical
School and through the hospital system

00:06:56.870 --> 00:07:00.680
where we can collaborate with others
doing really interesting work in

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:04.849
mindfulness and meditation and other
complementary therapies that you can

00:07:04.849 --> 00:07:10.760
actually measure something that is
serological, a measure a biomarker that

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:14.780
we can further validate what we're what
we're showing

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:20.880
My PTSD has affected my family and

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:27.540
again that's the part that really hit
home for me was I'm a good dad now

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:33.480
I have it in me with a little more
treatment to be a great dad.
