00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:05.000
We're on problem 167.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:12.540
If 1 plus 1 over x is equal to
2 minus 2 over x, then what

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.410
does x equal?

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:16.830
The first thing I would do is--
I don't like these x's in

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:17.580
the denominator.

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.180
So let's just multiply both
sides of this equation by x.

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:31.840
So I'll get x plus-- x over x is
just 1-- equals 2x minus 2.

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.692
Now I can subtract 1
from both sides.

00:00:34.692 --> 00:00:38.710
Actually, let's add 2 to both
sides, so you get x plus 3 is

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:40.570
equal to 2x.

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:42.030
Let's subtract x from
both sides.

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.900
You get 3 is equal to x.

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.470
And that's choice E.

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:50.095
I think I have the hiccups.

00:00:50.095 --> 00:00:53.330
I hope you don't notice, or if
you do, I hope it doesn't

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.800
bother you.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.170
Problem 168.

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.220
Last year, for every 100 million
vehicles that traveled

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:03.680
on a certain highway,
96 vehicles

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:04.879
were involved in accidents.

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:09.970
So 96 vehicles for every
100 million.

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:15.700
So 100 times a million is 10
to the sixth vehicles.

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.060
If 3 billion vehicles traveled
on the highway last year, how

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.350
many of those vehicles were
involved in accidents?

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.370
You could view this as the
fraction that will be involved

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:28.650
in accidents, so we just
multiply that times the total

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:29.960
number of vehicles.

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.130
That's 3 times a billion.

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.000
And they even write a billion
as 1 with 9 0's, so it's 3

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.150
times 10 to the ninth.

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:41.940
So if we simplify this
a little bit, let's

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:43.200
see what we can do.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.840
So 100 times 10 to the sixth,
this is the same thing as 1

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.130
times 10 to the eighth.

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.260
You could view this as 10 to
the second times 10 to the

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.570
sixth is 10 to the eighth.

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:58.180
If you have a 10 to the ninth in
the denominator divided by

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.630
10 to the eighth, this cancels
out and you're

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.230
just left with a 10.

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:06.590
So the denominator becomes
1, and the numerator

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.625
becomes 96 times 30.

00:02:09.625 --> 00:02:19.620
And 96 times 30 is-- let's put a
0 here and then 3 times 6 is

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:31.660
18, 3 times 9 is 27
plus 1 is 28.

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.340
How many vehicles are involved
in accidents?

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.660
2,880, C.

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.840
I think this number is low
compared to the reality.

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.930
I think actually it's closer
to the 40,000 range.

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:46.580
That's what want.

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.330
How many of those vehicles are
involved in accidents?

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.265
We multiply the fraction that
have an accident times the

00:02:51.265 --> 00:02:54.390
total number of vehicles, and
then you get your answer.

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:55.880
2,880.

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:01.100
Next question, 169.

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.880
30% of the members of a swim
team have passed the

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:09.310
lifesaving test.
So 30% passed.

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.870
Among the members will have
passed the test, 12 have taken

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.360
the preparatory course.

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.950
So this the 70% not passed.

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:24.100
And they say that 12 have taken
a course, so 12 course.

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:25.730
And 30 have not taken
the course.

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.900
How many members are
in the swim club?

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.690
So many people have not
passed the test?

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:37.560
They said that 12 have taken
a course, 30 haven't.

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:38.730
I'm assuming that's
all of them.

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:43.290
So the 70% that have not passed,
that is 12 plus 30 is

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:44.710
equal to 42.

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:48.340
And this is 70% of the total
people in the swim club.

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:53.180
So 70% of the total
is equal to 42.

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:59.810
So the total is equal to
42 divided by 0.7.

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:03.060
42 divided by 7 would be 6, but
since we're dividing it by

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.000
1/10 of that, it's going
to be equal to 60.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.920
And that make sense.

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:07.910
70% of 60 is 42.

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:09.780
So there's 60 people in the
swim club, and that's A.

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:17.920
Problem 170.

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:20.500
In a certain company, the
ratio of the number of

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.300
managers to the number
of production

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:30.750
line workers is 5:72.

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:34.260
If 8 additional production line
workers were to be hired,

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.460
the ratio of the number of
managers to the number of

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.730
production line workers
would be 5:74.

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:45.510
So if we hire 8 more
workers, then the

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:54.900
ratio is equal to 5:74.

00:04:54.900 --> 00:05:00.720
How many managers does
the company have?

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.360
So this is interesting.

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:04.670
Let's think of it this way.

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:07.550
There's a quick way to think
about it, and then there's an

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:09.650
algebraic way, and we'll
do both of them.

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:13.950
But when we add 8 to the bottom
of this-- when we add 8

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:18.110
to the number of workers--
the ratio actually only

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:19.360
increased by 2.

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:26.910
So what's happening is we
probably have 4 times as many

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:28.260
workers as this ratio
predicts.

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:36.080
So the ratio is probably
20:288.

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:37.720
And let's think about
that logic.

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:41.540
Because 20/288-- this is 5/72 if
you were to divide the top

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:46.980
and the bottom by 4-- and if you
were add 8 to the bottom,

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:50.420
you would get 20/296.

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:53.537
And then if you divide this by
4, if you just take this to

00:05:53.537 --> 00:05:56.070
the lowest reduced
form, you get 5.

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:57.770
Divide that by 4.

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:59.740
This divided by 4 is what?

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:02.120
It's 74.

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:05.740
So if you see that intuition
that I'm talking about, that

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:10.550
when you add 8 workers it only
increased this reduced form by

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:14.550
2, that means that this reduced
form is probably 1/4

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:16.300
of the real number.

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:18.190
Because 2 is 1/4 of 8.

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:19.910
If that doesn't make sense to
you, don't worry about it.

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:21.330
But if you did it this
way, you could say

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:22.700
there must be 20 managers.

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:25.240
And that would be a very fast
way of solving this problem.

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:28.145
But we can also do it
alegebraically.

00:06:28.145 --> 00:06:31.070
So you could use this
information to say 5 times the

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:38.050
workers is equal to 72
times the managers.

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:43.120
And then you can use this
information to say 5 times the

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:48.210
workers plus 40-- I'm just
cross-multiplying, so 5 times

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:52.700
w8-- is equal to 72 times
the managers.

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:55.960
And now we can do
some algebra.

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:57.870
So let's subtract this from.

00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:01.520
Let me say minus 5w
is equal to minus

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:04.630
72 times the managers.

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:05.950
Subtract this from this.

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:06.620
These cancel out.

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:10.550
You get 40 is equal
to 74 minus 72

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:12.320
is 2 times the managers.

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:15.265
So then you get the managers are
equal to 20, which is what

00:07:15.265 --> 00:07:16.090
we figured out the first time.

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:17.790
Maybe this is simpler for you.

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:19.510
And I would probably do that
on the exam to make sure I

00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:22.400
didn't make a careless
mistake.

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:31.200
Next question, 171.

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:38.350
If x minus 1 squared is equal to
400, which of the following

00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:40.750
could be the value
of x minus 1?

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:44.110
x minus 1 squared is equal to
400, so that means x minus 1

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:48.430
is equal to positive 20, the
positive square root of 400.

00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:49.340
And don't forget this.

00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:53.580
This also means that x minus 1
could equal minus 20, because

00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:56.660
minus 20 squared is also 400,
the negative square root.

00:07:56.660 --> 00:07:58.720
In this case, if you add 1
to both sides, you get

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:00.900
x is equal to 21.

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:04.520
In this case, if you add 1 to
both sides, you get x is equal

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:09.720
to minus 19.

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:11.050
So that's what the
values of x are.

00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:15.000
So what can be a value
of x minus 5?

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.330
That's what they ask for,
they're not asking for the

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:17.390
value of x.

00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:21.400
x minus 5 in this case would
be-- what's 21 minus 5?

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:29.040
That's 16, minus 19 minus 5.

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:30.270
That's minus 24.

00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:35.240
So x minus 5 could be 16,
or it could be minus 24.

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:39.059
And they only have this one
there, so it's choice C.

00:08:39.059 --> 00:08:41.990
So they were just testing to see
if you remembered that x

00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:45.200
minus 1 could be the minus
square root of 400, the

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:46.450
negative square root.

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:53.550
Problem 172.

00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:57.530
Which of the following describes
all values of x for

00:08:57.530 --> 00:09:05.880
which 1 minus x squared is
greater than or equal to 0?

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:09.640
So let's add x squared to both
sides of this equation.

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:13.360
So then you get 1-- x squared
plus minus x squared, that

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:16.990
zero-- is greater than or
equal to x squared.

00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:18.410
I'm just going to switch it
because that's just how I

00:09:18.410 --> 00:09:21.630
think. x squared is less
than or equal to 1.

00:09:24.950 --> 00:09:27.030
We're dealing with real numbers,
so x squared is going

00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:28.310
to be a positive number.

00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:32.520
So the only way that I can
square a positive number and

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:35.720
have it be less than or equal 1,
is if x itself is less than

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:36.600
or equal to 1.

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:40.290
Or it could be greater than or
equal to negative 1, because

00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:43.820
those numbers will square
to being positive.

00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:48.100
So x would be less than
or equal to 1.

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:50.620
But it can also be greater than
or equal to negative 1.

00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:51.220
And you could try it.

00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:52.470
Try negative 1/2.

00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:56.090
Negative 1/2 squared
is positive 1/4.

00:09:56.090 --> 00:09:58.270
No matter what, whether it's
positive or negative, this is

00:09:58.270 --> 00:09:59.750
going to be a positive number.

00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:02.490
And the magnitude can
be at most 1.

00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:04.940
So that takes us from
minus 1 to 1.

00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:05.965
And even 0 works.

00:10:05.965 --> 00:10:07.870
So let's see if that's
one of the choices.

00:10:07.870 --> 00:10:09.850
That's choice E.

00:10:09.850 --> 00:10:12.180
And I'll see you in
the next video.
