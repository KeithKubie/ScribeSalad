BRADY HARAN: Do you
like it still?

00:00:12.986 --> 00:00:14.986
ALAN STEWART: It's all right.

00:00:14.986 --> 00:00:16.525
It's got a nice bounce to it.

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:22.410
BRADY HARAN: Hi there,
everyone.

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:23.750
I'm Brady from Numberphile.

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.150
And this is going to be bit of
a video with a difference

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:28.420
because I've come all the way
to Southampton to visit

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:31.555
someone I've never met in
the flesh until now.

00:00:31.555 --> 00:00:33.260
He's real.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.230
This is Alan Stewart.

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.030
And for those of you who watched
a few of my videos,

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.230
you'll be familiar with Alan's
work because he makes music,

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:42.810
as you probably guessed.

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:45.980
And he's put music on
loads of my videos.

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.240
And what we're going to do now,
before we get going, is

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.470
play you a bit of a montage of
some of the videos for which

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:53.100
Alan has composed his
masterpieces.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.759

00:00:56.759 --> 00:00:59.510
MATT PARKER: To get any kind
of accuracy on our final

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.609
answer, we have to be as
precise as we can be.

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:47.519
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:47.519 --> 00:01:50.870
BRADY HARAN: So that's some
examples of Alan's work.

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:54.840
Now very quickly, before we get
going, I must say early on

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.440
Alan has a YouTube channel,
ALANKEY86.

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.240
Subscribe to ALANKEY86.

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.360
Because if you do that, you
might make more music for me.

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.410
But also, Alan does loads
of other things.

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.360
He's always putting all sorts
of cool stuff on there.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.920
Sometimes he just puts raw
tracks of the stuff he makes

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:14.640
for Numberphile.

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.420
But he also does all
of his own work.

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.270
And it's always full of really
interesting stuff.

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:19.640
So go and check it out.

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:20.130

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.840
They'll be a link underneath
and on the screen and

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:23.310
everywhere.

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.130
And I'll sure we'll talk
about it more later.

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.950
So first thing's first,
we're going to get to

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:30.830
know the man himself.

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.140
And after we've spoken about
that, we're going to talk

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.730
about some of the music and some
of the maths and science

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.460
embedded in the music, which
will be really interesting.

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.460
First of all, I've been doing
a lot of talking here.

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:42.710
You want to say something?

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:43.475
ALAN STEWART: Yes.

00:02:43.475 --> 00:02:44.600
I don't know what to say.

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:45.490
BRADY HARAN: Let me ask
you some questions.

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:46.320
ALAN STEWART: Thanks.

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.140
BRADY HARAN: The first thing we
should ask, because we'll

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.630
probably get asked about
it in the comments,

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.940
is about your eye.

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.500
Your two eyes are slightly
different.

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.530
And I know YouTube is--

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.320
they're not shy about writing
about what they see.

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:00.230
Should we talk about that?

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:01.100
What's going on there?

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:02.840
ALAN STEWART: Let's do that.

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.350
In my right eye, I have a
condition called band

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:09.180
keratopathy, which is a
buildup of mineral.

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:10.416
So it's just cloudy.

00:03:10.416 --> 00:03:14.090
And I can't see out of
that eye at all.

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:18.250
My left eye is going
the same way.

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.770
So my vision in my left eye
is not perfect either.

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:22.690
BRADY HARAN: OK.

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:23.680
There you go.

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:24.760
Now you know.

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.070
So you probably don't need to
write thousands comments.

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:27.870
What's it's called again?

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.480
ALAN STEWART: Band
keratopathy.

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:30.950
BRADY HARAN: Band keratopathy.

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:32.360
There we go.

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:36.220
So now, let's find out
a bit about you.

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:39.300
You have a sort of a sciency
background or a mathematicky

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.610
background?

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.920
Talk to us.

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:41.090
ALAN STEWART: Yes.

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:45.370
I did a degree in physics at the
University of Southampton.

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.970
And I got my master's
there in 2008.

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:54.640
My musical background is
kind of nonexistent.

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:59.412
I had a piano lessons for two
years when I was a teenager.

00:03:59.412 --> 00:04:04.350
Well, because of my eyesight, I
never learned to read music.

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:07.040
I can't physically see
the music to read it.

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.540
So that kind of limited
what I could do.

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:12.655
So I stopped having lessons.

00:04:12.655 --> 00:04:16.039
But I continued to play and just
kind of taught myself.

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:17.079
BRADY HARAN: So you've
taught yourself.

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:18.850
You don't read or write music.

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:19.720
ALAN STEWART: No.

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:20.740
BRADY HARAN: If you don't
read or write

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:22.390
music, what do you do?

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:26.330
Do you just learn what
key sounds like what?

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:29.150
And when you press these in this
order, it sounds good?

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:30.600
ALAN STEWART: Yeah.

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:31.460
I play by ear.

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:36.830
So if I hear something, as long
as it's not like Bach or

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:39.610
something, I can usually
emulate it, try

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:42.200
and copy what I hear.

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:47.020
And I've been told I have
perfect pitch, which is like

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:52.470
the ability to hear a note and
just say, oh, that's an A. So

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:53.440
I guess that helps.

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:54.070
BRADY HARAN: OK.

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.790
Don't look.

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:55.440
What's this?

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.208
[NOTE PLAYING]

00:04:57.208 --> 00:04:59.920
ALAN STEWART: Oh.

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:00.440
Do you know?

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:03.360
BRADY HARAN: No.

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.965
You're all very quickly going
to learn that I have no idea

00:05:05.965 --> 00:05:07.990
what any notes are.

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:09.710
Do you know?

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:11.690
ALAN STEWART: Sometimes I
have to think about it.

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:13.050
BRADY HARAN: I'll play
a different one.

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:13.290
It won't be the same one.

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:14.330
ALAN STEWART: Was it G?

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:14.675
BRADY HARAN: I don't know.

00:05:14.675 --> 00:05:14.845
It was one of these ones.

00:05:14.845 --> 00:05:15.704
ALAN STEWART: Go on, go
on, play it again.

00:05:15.704 --> 00:05:16.970
BRADY HARAN: It was
one of these ones.

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:17.950
ALAN STEWART: One
of these ones.

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:19.150
BRADY HARAN: I don't even
know what one it was.

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:20.230
ALAN STEWART: And I
can play it again.

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:20.500
[NOTE PLAYING]

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:21.780
ALAN STEWART: It was B.

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:23.170
BRADY HARAN: It was B.

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:25.080
ALAN STEWART: I was way off.

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:26.490
But I was able to
play it again.

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:28.050
BRADY HARAN: You were.

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:29.565
So what's that, semi-perfect
pitch, maybe?

00:05:29.565 --> 00:05:30.920
ALAN STEWART: I think, yeah.

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:32.050
Perfect is a stretch.

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:36.746
Let's just say able to hear a
note and play it back again.

00:05:36.746 --> 00:05:39.550
BRADY HARAN: Now you're not
a professional musician.

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:40.740
That's not how you
make your living.

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:41.270
ALAN STEWART: No.

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:42.120
BRADY HARAN: What's your job?

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:43.950
ALAN STEWART: I am a teacher.

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:48.440
I teach A-level physics at
Queen Mary's College.

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:50.728
I've been a teacher
for four years.

00:05:50.728 --> 00:05:52.360
And I love it.

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.310
BRADY HARAN: People are
going to ask how we

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:55.950
ended up working together.

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:58.384
So tell us that story for
as long as it takes.

00:05:58.384 --> 00:06:00.210
How did we end up working
together?

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:01.560
And go back as far
as you need.

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.140
ALAN STEWART: OK.

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:07.060
I think the first
thing I did--

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:08.250
I'm embarrassed about
it, though.

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:09.700
So I don't want to
talk about it.

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:10.450
BRADY HARAN: Really?

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:10.782
ALAN STEWART: Yeah.

BRADY HARAN: Is it criminal
or something?

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:12.020
ALAN STEWART: No, no.

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:13.760
It's that "Sixty
Symbols" song.

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:15.730
BRADY HARAN: Ahh, you made
a "Sixty Symbols" song.

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:15.940
ALAN STEWART: Yeah.

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:16.990
It wasn't very good.

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:17.830
It wasn't very cool.

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:18.730
BRADY HARAN: No, it
wasn't very cool.

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:20.730
ALAN STEWART: So I've actually
unlisted it now.

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:21.430
BRADY HARAN: Really?

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:22.140
ALAN STEWART: Yeah.

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:24.310
Because it wasn't as good as--

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:26.210
BRADY HARAN: Oh, well, I'm
going to tell everyone.

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:26.885
ALAN STEWART: No, you don't.

00:06:26.885 --> 00:06:28.055
Don't.

00:06:28.055 --> 00:06:29.490
BRADY HARAN: No, I'm
going to tell you.

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:31.295
I'm going to tell you.

00:06:31.295 --> 00:06:35.780
Alan made little song about the
"Sixty Symbols." And he

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:39.130
sent it to me just to see if
I thought it was all right,

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:40.460
because you had used some of
our video footage, too.

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:41.390
ALAN STEWART: I had.

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:42.850
BRADY HARAN: You asked
permission.

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:45.420
And he was just saying that he
doesn't like it any more.

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:46.880
And he's unlisted the song.

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:48.020
He's embarrassed by it.

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:51.470
But I think it had some pretty
cool bits to it as well.

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:53.940
I thought it was
very Vangelis.

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:54.520
How do you say his name?

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:55.960
ALAN STEWART: Oh, Vangelis?

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:56.415
BRADY HARAN: Yeah.

00:06:56.415 --> 00:06:56.690
Vangelis.

00:06:56.690 --> 00:06:58.280
ALAN STEWART: Yeah.

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:00.670
BRADY HARAN: I thought bits of
it sounded quite like him.

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:02.705
I quite liked bits
of the song.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:07:15.145 --> 00:07:16.905
BRADY HARAN: And as
a result of that--

00:07:16.905 --> 00:07:17.490
ALAN STEWART: Yes, that's
the way it was.

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:20.870
BRADY HARAN: As a result of the
bits I liked, I asked you

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:22.355
if you'd compose some
more music.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:38.240
ALAN STEWART: I think the first
bit of music I did was

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:41.230
for the Rubik's cube video,
where you had all the

00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:43.320
different people solving
Rubik's cubes.

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:46.430
And I wrote some '80s
backing music.

00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:58.435
This is my Rubik's
cube attempt.

00:07:58.435 --> 00:08:00.920
BRADY HARAN: I asked for it
to be kind of retro and

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:01.750
'80s, didn't I?

00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:03.250
ALAN STEWART: Yeah.

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:05.610
But I also did some other
bits of music.

00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:09.000
I think I sent you maybe four
or five different ideas.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.776
And actually, you ended
up using all of them.

00:08:12.776 --> 00:08:13.500
BRADY HARAN: On different
videos.

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:14.620
ALAN STEWART: On different
videos, yeah.

00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:15.640
It wasn't my intention.

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:18.910
But you decided to use one for
Periodic Videos, and another

00:08:18.910 --> 00:08:20.952
one later on in Numberphile.

00:08:20.952 --> 00:08:21.690

there you go.

00:08:28.263 --> 00:08:29.010
sent a whole bunch.

00:08:29.010 --> 00:08:30.210

different videos.

ALAN STEWART: Yeah.

00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:32.729
BRADY HARAN: None of them
were particularly

mathematical or science.

Well, let's skip to
some that do.

Let's not go chronologically.

00:08:42.689 --> 00:08:45.560
But let's go to one that I think
we should do with CERN.

00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:48.830

bagpipes.

ALAN STEWART: Fibonacci
bagpipes.

00:08:49.793 --> 00:08:51.510
BRADY HARAN: By way of
background, I should probably

00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:54.720
give some background, because I
had a tartan made which was

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:56.620
based on the Fibonacci
sequence.

00:08:56.620 --> 00:09:02.320
And as a result, I wanted some
sort of Scottish music that

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:05.130
was sort of imbued with
Fibonacciness.

00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:07.980
And I sent an email to Alan.

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:09.390
Did I mention his
YouTube channel?

00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:13.060
ALANKEY86.

00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:15.690
I sent an email to Alan.

00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:20.450
And one of the best things about
working with Alan is he

00:09:20.450 --> 00:09:22.865
works so quickly.

00:09:22.865 --> 00:09:25.560
I'm so lucky that people help
out with the YouTube channels.

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:26.920
And sometimes I'll
ask someone for

00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:28.410
some music or an animation.

00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:31.870
And because everyone's busy--
you're a busy man--

00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:33.910
maybe a week or two later,
I might get a

00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:35.220
response and some help.

00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:39.250
But whenever I ask Alan for a
piece of music, sometimes

00:09:39.250 --> 00:09:41.970
within half an hour or an
hour, I get an email of

00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:45.315
something he's just composed
and played and recorded.

00:09:45.315 --> 00:09:48.560

that was a really quick

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:48.950

ALAN STEWART: Certainly not.

BRADY HARAN: First of all, how
were you able to make a

00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:34.930
ALAN STEWART: Well, I feel like
I should acknowledge the

00:10:34.930 --> 00:10:37.950
fact that it is just completely
synthesized in a

00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:40.540
very unprofessional way.

00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:40.970
BRADY HARAN: OK.

00:10:40.970 --> 00:10:45.210
ALAN STEWART: I mixed together
trumpets and piccolos and

00:10:45.210 --> 00:10:48.680
various presets on the keyboard
until I had something

00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:52.160
that sounded squeaky and
slightly annoying.

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:54.270
BRADY HARAN: So it's just a

00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:55.740

BRADY HARAN: Alan, you've

00:11:29.045 --> 00:11:30.130
ALAN STEWART: OK.

00:11:30.130 --> 00:11:34.820
The original piece is in B flat,
because that's what I

00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:36.345
thought bagpipes
were tuned to.

00:11:36.345 --> 00:11:39.160
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:40.980
ALAN STEWART: That's the
scale of B flat.

00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:44.150
But I think to make it simpler
to explain, I'll actually play

00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:46.230
it in C. So you can
number the notes.

00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:51.920
Here's the very first note--
number 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:55.870
And then, of course, the eighth
note is the octave.

00:11:55.870 --> 00:11:58.510
What I did was I took
the terms in

00:11:58.510 --> 00:11:59.375
the Fibonacci sequence.

00:11:59.375 --> 00:12:03.690
And I mapped them onto
the musical scale.

00:12:03.690 --> 00:12:09.250
So the Fibonacci sequence
starts 1, 1, 2, 3, 5.

00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:15.054
So that just comes out
as 1, 1, 2, 3, 5.

00:12:15.054 --> 00:12:17.350
The next term is 8.

00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:20.290
So I could jump up to
the eighth note.

00:12:20.290 --> 00:12:24.940
But instead, I decided to take
it full circle and just go

00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:26.810
back to the first note.

00:12:26.810 --> 00:12:28.490
I mean, it's the same note.

00:12:28.490 --> 00:12:29.380
It's still a C.

00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:29.805
[NOTE PLAYING]

00:12:29.805 --> 00:12:31.380
ALAN STEWART: So that's
the eighth note.

00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:37.186
So it goes 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8.

00:12:37.186 --> 00:12:40.510
The next term in the Fibonacci
sequence is 13.

00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:44.440
So I suppose I could
have continued to

00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:46.540
climb up the keyboard.

00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:48.140

The next term is 21.

The 21st note is--

ALAN STEWART: It doesn't
sound right.

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:09.310
So can I use maths?

00:13:09.310 --> 00:13:10.710
Thanks.

00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:14.170
What I did was I took
all the terms of

00:13:14.170 --> 00:13:14.975
the Fibonacci sequence.

00:13:14.975 --> 00:13:22.860
And I did mod 7 of the term,
which basically means if you

00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:26.210
take the number-- there's
the Fibonacci number--

00:13:26.210 --> 00:13:32.560
and divide it by 7, what
remainder are you left with?

00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:36.300
So if you take, say, the number
8 and divide that by 7,

00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:40.630
obviously you're going
to get 1 left over.

00:13:40.630 --> 00:13:43.950
If you take 13 and divide that
by 7, you're going to have a

00:13:43.950 --> 00:13:46.740
remainder of 6.

00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:52.730
So in this column here, these
are the result of doing mod 7

00:13:52.730 --> 00:13:55.290
on all the Fibonacci terms.

00:13:55.290 --> 00:13:59.350
And this then allows you to map
the notes into one sort of

00:13:59.350 --> 00:14:01.050
zone on the keyboard.

00:14:01.050 --> 00:14:07.206
Well, it gives you 1, 1,
2, 3, 5, 1, 6, 0, 6,

00:14:07.206 --> 00:14:09.130
6, 5, and so on.

00:14:09.130 --> 00:14:14.720
Then I just took those numbers
and mapped them onto the C

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:15.530

00:14:15.530 --> 00:14:16.735

just played in an

awful way, because every note
had the same length.

So to give it a bit
more rhythm--

00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:37.770
because the Scots like
their rhythm--

00:14:37.770 --> 00:14:40.750

then 3, and then 5.

actually exactly the same

keep on cycling.

I know we don't need
to show you this.

00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:45.880
But on the spreadsheet, you can
just keep on going up the

just keeps cycling.

I don't know if I'm explaining
that well.

So there is no more to
the Fibonacci music.

00:16:09.995 --> 00:16:11.190
ALAN STEWART: I'm
sure there is.

00:16:11.190 --> 00:16:15.110
And being a physicist, I'm not
quite good enough at the maths

00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:17.540
to be able to explain
why that is.

00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:19.685
Maybe a numberphile will be able
to explain what is it.

00:16:19.685 --> 00:16:20.475
BRADY HARAN: Excellent.

00:16:20.475 --> 00:16:23.830
ALAN STEWART: Anyway.

00:16:23.830 --> 00:16:26.150
That's one Fibonacci element.

00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:32.910
The other thing is the tempo
is 89 beats per minute.

00:16:32.910 --> 00:16:37.360
There's a pulse, click to the
music that just taps a regular

89 beats in a minute.

00:16:41.250 --> 00:16:46.300
Now the drumming in the song
isn't just a simple pulse of

00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:47.690
89 beats per minute.

00:16:47.690 --> 00:16:49.070

that pulse?

ALAN STEWART: I had a click
track in Audacity that was

00:16:52.650 --> 00:16:55.490
just constantly ticking at
89 beats per minutes.

00:16:55.490 --> 00:16:56.410
BRADY HARAN: And then
you took that out?

00:16:56.410 --> 00:16:58.540
ALAN STEWART: I took that out
just to keep me in time.

00:16:58.540 --> 00:17:01.600
BRADY HARAN: So what is in
time with that, then?

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:06.695

Can you play the track for me?

00:17:07.667 --> 00:17:08.581

That's what 89 beats per

really know what--

of the click track?

ALAN STEWART: Well, maybe if I
talk about breaking the rules,

00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:07.340
when I break the rules, I'm
taking the time interval

00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:09.840
between one click and
the next click.

00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:13.060
And I'm cutting it in
half, for example.

00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:19.150
So when one click happens, I
might play two notes of the

00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:38.080
That's what it would sound like
to have half the click

00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:43.630
And I think that's how
all music and all

00:19:43.630 --> 00:19:44.910

00:19:44.910 --> 00:19:47.320
You take the click track.

00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:50.260
And then the space in between
the clicks, you cut

00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:52.390
it perhaps in half.

00:19:52.390 --> 00:19:55.410
Or you cut it into three
pieces or cut

00:19:55.410 --> 00:19:56.860
it into four pieces.

00:19:56.860 --> 00:20:03.430
And usually you stick to notes
of those durations, so half a

click or a third of a click.

00:20:05.235 --> 00:20:12.510

put two notes between clicks,

could say that I was, except

that not every note is two
notes between the clicks.

the duration between one

ever skip a beat?

ALAN STEWART: Oh,
yeah, sometimes.

00:20:44.750 --> 00:20:48.380
Everything I do in this song
is some multiple of that or

some division of that.

But instead, I wanted it to

consecutive Fibonacci numbers

00:24:10.770 --> 00:24:15.070
and you do the bigger one
divided by the little one,

00:24:15.070 --> 00:24:19.910

to the golden

little Fibonacci numbers, like

arty experience for you?

00:26:01.390 --> 00:26:03.720
And to what extent are you
thinking very much about

00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:07.740
numbers and octaves and science
and dividing beats

00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:10.106
into factors and things?

00:26:10.106 --> 00:26:12.480
ALAN STEWART: I think that's
a really good question.

00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:16.770
And I would say none at all.

00:26:16.770 --> 00:26:19.725
I don't think in terms
of mathematics.

00:26:19.725 --> 00:26:22.990
I don't think in terms
of the science of it.

00:26:22.990 --> 00:26:26.520
I just literally play what
I think sounds good.

00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:31.240
However, if I want to compose
a piece which is based on,

00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:36.930
say, the Fibonacci sequence or
pi, then I can use maths to

00:26:36.930 --> 00:26:41.740
map it onto music and art.

00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:44.600
And so I feel like there
is a crossover.

00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:48.865
But I'm not conscious of
it when I'm playing.

00:26:48.865 --> 00:26:51.680
BRADY HARAN: So when I drop
you an email and say,

00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:52.420
can you help me?

00:26:52.420 --> 00:26:54.690
Can you come up with some
music based on this

00:26:54.690 --> 00:26:57.590
mathematical principle, how
much is that putting a

00:26:57.590 --> 00:26:58.940
straitjacket on you?

00:26:58.940 --> 00:27:02.310
And how much is that making
it more fun and enjoyable?

00:27:02.310 --> 00:27:04.850
ALAN STEWART: I think
sometimes having a

00:27:04.850 --> 00:27:09.860
straitjacket, having a very
specific brief can actually

00:27:09.860 --> 00:27:11.140
really help.

00:27:11.140 --> 00:27:16.330
Because if you're just told to
compose some background music

00:27:16.330 --> 00:27:20.360
for, I don't know,
an elephant--

00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:20.850
actually, no.

00:27:20.850 --> 00:27:23.740
That's probably quite easy
to do, actually.

00:27:23.740 --> 00:27:30.240
But if you were just asked to
compose a nice piece of music,

00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:31.800
where do you start?

00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:34.480
Whereas if you're asked to
compose a piece of music

00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:39.040
that's based on Fibonacci, then
that does actually help

00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:41.085
to have the restriction.

00:27:41.085 --> 00:27:44.510
BRADY HARAN: Well, speaking of
restrictions, another request

00:27:44.510 --> 00:27:48.380
that I put in to you was to help
with some music for our

00:27:48.380 --> 00:27:53.790
video about calculating pi
with pies, which was an

00:27:53.790 --> 00:27:55.730
interesting video, and certainly
attracted some

00:27:55.730 --> 00:27:58.150
interesting comments, not
because of your music, but

00:27:58.150 --> 00:27:59.560
because of our use of pies.

00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:01.110
But let's not go into that.

00:28:01.110 --> 00:28:03.040
Let's talk about the music.

00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:05.000
Do you remember what
I asked you for?

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:06.180
I can't even remember
what I asked.

00:28:06.180 --> 00:28:08.170
I told you what we were doing.

00:28:08.170 --> 00:28:11.270
ALAN STEWART: You told me that
you were going to measure pi

00:28:11.270 --> 00:28:14.210
using laser pi's and you
wanted something

00:28:14.210 --> 00:28:16.580
quirky, you asked for.

00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:19.620
No.

00:28:19.620 --> 00:28:20.093
What did you ask for?

00:28:20.093 --> 00:28:23.041
BRADY HARAN: There was some kind
of toing and froing on

00:28:23.041 --> 00:28:23.950
this one, wasn't there?

00:28:23.950 --> 00:28:25.610
Did you send me something,
and I--

00:28:25.610 --> 00:28:25.990
ALAN STEWART: Yes.

00:28:25.990 --> 00:28:26.510
No.

00:28:26.510 --> 00:28:28.430
I think what it was was I think
you said you were going

00:28:28.430 --> 00:28:29.765
to do a video--

00:28:29.765 --> 00:28:30.200
yes.

00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:31.640
You said you were going to do
a video where you were going

00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:34.050
to measure pi using pies.

00:28:34.050 --> 00:28:36.730
And could I come up
with some music?

00:28:36.730 --> 00:28:38.910
It could be based
on pi, you said.

00:28:38.910 --> 00:28:41.760
And I thought, it's got
to be based on pi.

00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:44.600
Because if it's not
based on pi, then

00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:46.470
what's the point, really?

00:28:46.470 --> 00:28:52.380
So I sent you some just very
light piano music with a

00:28:52.380 --> 00:28:53.470
classical feel.

00:28:53.470 --> 00:28:56.160
It was very backgroundy, very
similar to the "Spaghetti

00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:57.520
Numbers" music.

00:28:57.520 --> 00:28:59.513
BRADY HARAN: Well, let's
play that now, because

00:28:59.513 --> 00:29:00.155
I still have that.

00:29:00.155 --> 00:29:02.768
Let's play what Alan
first sent.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:29:31.700 --> 00:29:32.980
ALAN STEWART: You
weren't unhappy.

00:29:32.980 --> 00:29:35.210
You said it was nice.

00:29:35.210 --> 00:29:40.140
But then I asked you, because
you described

00:29:40.140 --> 00:29:40.960
the activity to me.

00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:44.280
I asked you, was there any
sense of it being a bit

00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:46.900
sneaky, like you were doing
something you weren't supposed

00:29:46.900 --> 00:29:47.720
to be doing?

00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:49.790
Because what I'd done was
I played around a

00:29:49.790 --> 00:29:50.750
but more with pi.

00:29:50.750 --> 00:29:53.780
And I discovered that on a minor
scale, as opposed to a

00:29:53.780 --> 00:29:57.560
major scale, it had a very
different feel to it.

00:29:57.560 --> 00:30:01.310
And I'd come up with something
that I thought sounded quite--

00:30:01.310 --> 00:30:05.240
James Bondy was how I worded
it in my email to you.

00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:07.032
BRADY HARAN: I believe so.

00:30:07.032 --> 00:30:08.930
ALAN STEWART: So yeah.

00:30:08.930 --> 00:30:10.490
BRADY HARAN: We ended up with
something different.

00:30:10.490 --> 00:30:11.070
ALAN STEWART: We did, yeah.

00:30:11.070 --> 00:30:13.765
Something with a little bit
more tension to it.

00:30:13.765 --> 00:30:19.070
BRADY HARAN: A lot of people who
I showed the video said it

00:30:19.070 --> 00:30:20.050
wasn't what--

00:30:20.050 --> 00:30:23.090
because I told a lot of people
like my friends and things

00:30:23.090 --> 00:30:26.210
what I was doing, and that you
were making some music.

00:30:26.210 --> 00:30:29.800
And then when I showed them the
cut piece, a lot of them

00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:31.950
said that's completely
not what I expected

00:30:31.950 --> 00:30:32.390
the music to be like.

00:30:32.390 --> 00:30:33.275
ALAN STEWART: Oh, really?

00:30:33.275 --> 00:30:34.740
BRADY HARAN: And it
works really well.

00:30:34.740 --> 00:30:35.260
ALAN STEWART: Oh, that's cool.

00:30:35.260 --> 00:30:39.370
BRADY HARAN: It was kind of like
I think everyone who had

00:30:39.370 --> 00:30:42.325
an expectation of what that
video was going to be like was

00:30:42.325 --> 00:30:43.530
thrown a bit of a curve ball.

00:30:43.530 --> 00:30:47.245

actually do any measurement

00:30:59.980 --> 00:31:01.460
other than using pies.

00:31:01.460 --> 00:31:03.160
So the entire thing is going
to be pie based.

people about the music and

tell them about how you
embedded pi in it?

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:31:25.165 --> 00:31:30.470
ALAN STEWART: I come up with
very boring names, which are

00:31:30.470 --> 00:31:35.612
just for my benefit to remind
me what the feel of it is.

00:31:35.612 --> 00:31:38.510
I think this one was probably
just called--

00:31:38.510 --> 00:31:39.030
oh, no, wait.

00:31:39.030 --> 00:31:40.730
No, this had an important
name.

00:31:40.730 --> 00:31:47.130
This was called "Pi March,"
because musically it's similar

00:31:47.130 --> 00:31:49.390
to a march, like a
marching band.

00:31:49.390 --> 00:31:53.436
And Pi Day is in March.

00:31:53.436 --> 00:31:54.470

00:31:54.470 --> 00:31:57.240
By the way, if anyone's hearing
the construction work

we can do about that.

00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:02.622
It's because Alan's having
another house built, because

00:32:02.622 --> 00:32:02.900
he's a millionaire.

00:32:02.900 --> 00:32:03.800
ALAN STEWART: OK.

00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:08.860
So again, I don't know
how to describe it.

00:32:08.860 --> 00:32:12.360
It's very conventional to map,
I think, the digits of a

00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:13.850
number onto a scale.

00:32:13.850 --> 00:32:16.820
And with Fibonacci, we were
putting the numbers of the

00:32:16.820 --> 00:32:20.810

notes of the C major scale,

00:32:20.810 --> 00:32:21.279

different, just to be

put pi on a minor scale.

is that outrageous?

some other people.

video called "The Sounds of

with the left hand.

00:34:44.540 --> 00:34:44.850
Sorry.

00:34:44.850 --> 00:34:45.380
It goes--

00:34:45.380 --> 00:34:54.054
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:34:54.054 --> 00:34:57.380
ALAN STEWART: And that rhythm
I thought sounded good.

00:34:57.380 --> 00:34:59.765
And that's what I
ended up with.

00:34:59.765 --> 00:35:00.880
BRADY HARAN: What were
you doing there?

00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:01.930
Was that breaking the rules?

00:35:01.930 --> 00:35:03.577
Or was that part of pi as well,
that little thing you do

00:35:03.577 --> 00:35:03.705
with your left hand?

00:35:03.705 --> 00:35:06.170
Or is that just a little bit of
a flourish you put in for

00:35:06.170 --> 00:35:06.980
musical reasons?

00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:11.460
ALAN STEWART: That was the arty,
musical side of me, and

00:35:11.460 --> 00:35:13.340
has nothing to do with math.

00:35:13.340 --> 00:35:17.061
It's just me making
it sound good.

00:35:17.061 --> 00:35:26.801
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:35:26.801 --> 00:35:28.280
BRADY HARAN: OK.

00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:30.326
So the notes were based on pi.

00:35:30.326 --> 00:35:32.430
You went a bit further,
didn't you, as usual?

00:35:32.430 --> 00:35:33.380
ALAN STEWART: Yeah.

00:35:33.380 --> 00:35:34.860
Yeah.

00:35:34.860 --> 00:35:37.490
The tempo, the number of
beats per minute, was

00:35:37.490 --> 00:35:40.200
some multiple of pi.

00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:42.820
It was 104 beats per minute.

00:35:42.820 --> 00:35:44.000
BRADY HARAN: Why is that?

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:44.740
What's that?

00:35:44.740 --> 00:35:50.970
ALAN STEWART: That's pi
multiplied by 33.3 recurring.

00:35:50.970 --> 00:35:54.590
What I did was pi times
100 divided by 3.

00:35:54.590 --> 00:35:56.772
BRADY HARAN: What else
was marching?

00:35:56.772 --> 00:35:57.015
There were drums and things,
weren't there?

00:35:57.015 --> 00:35:59.960
ALAN STEWART: In the "Pi March,"
yes, yes, the same

00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:03.640
drum beats that were in the
Fibonacci, the same

00:36:03.640 --> 00:36:04.390
principles.

00:36:04.390 --> 00:36:07.040
So the first digit of pi is 3.

00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:11.290
So there were 3 blasts on drum,
and then one blast on

00:36:11.290 --> 00:36:13.910
the drum, and then 4.

00:36:13.910 --> 00:36:16.030
And I think that stands out.

00:36:16.030 --> 00:36:16.820
That's quite obvious.

00:36:16.820 --> 00:36:26.630
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:36:26.630 --> 00:36:29.190
MATT PARKER: This is a mild
problem, because I want to go

00:36:29.190 --> 00:36:30.250
from the very edge
of the circle.

00:36:30.250 --> 00:36:32.420
But as you can see, I've
positioned all the pies.

00:36:32.420 --> 00:36:37.400
BRADY HARAN: What's it like for
you when you make a bit of

00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:40.100
music like you do for people
like me, and then you see the

00:36:40.100 --> 00:36:42.970
video on YouTube with
your music on it?

00:36:42.970 --> 00:36:45.240
What's that like?

00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:46.420
ALAN STEWART: I love it.

00:36:46.420 --> 00:36:49.700
I'm always really excited if
it's going to be a video with

00:36:49.700 --> 00:36:50.430
some music.

00:36:50.430 --> 00:36:53.492
And I guess--

00:36:53.492 --> 00:36:54.445
I don't know.

00:36:54.445 --> 00:36:56.285
It makes it come alive.

00:36:56.285 --> 00:36:57.485
BRADY HARAN: Is it
different for you

00:36:57.485 --> 00:36:58.310
when you see the video?

00:36:58.310 --> 00:37:00.870
I say, this is what the
video is about.

00:37:00.870 --> 00:37:02.927
Do you feel like, no, that's not
what I expected the video

00:37:02.927 --> 00:37:06.392
to be like, or how I expected
my music to used?

00:37:06.392 --> 00:37:11.750
ALAN STEWART: I think usually
your editing fits really well

00:37:11.750 --> 00:37:12.700
with the music.

00:37:12.700 --> 00:37:17.900
So in the pi video, you cut
on the beat, for example.

00:37:17.900 --> 00:37:21.020
Or you would cut at the
end of a phrase.

00:37:21.020 --> 00:37:24.420
And so I was really delighted
with how it looked in the end.

00:37:24.420 --> 00:37:26.150
It matched the music.

00:37:26.150 --> 00:37:34.497
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:37:34.497 --> 00:37:38.820
BRADY HARAN: Do you
like it still?

00:37:38.820 --> 00:37:40.826
ALAN STEWART: It's all right.

00:37:40.826 --> 00:37:42.740
It's got a nice bounce to it.

00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:46.590
I don't know what else to say.

00:37:46.590 --> 00:37:49.450
BRADY HARAN: You don't like
listening to you own music?

00:37:49.450 --> 00:37:52.660
ALAN STEWART: I guess
I play it.

00:37:52.660 --> 00:37:53.085
I play it.

00:37:53.085 --> 00:37:53.160
I play it.

00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:53.415
I play it.

00:37:53.415 --> 00:37:54.440
I practice it.

00:37:54.440 --> 00:37:55.170
I record it.

00:37:55.170 --> 00:37:56.120
I listen to it.

00:37:56.120 --> 00:38:01.930
And so after you've heard it
like 50 times, it loses its

00:38:01.930 --> 00:38:04.760
initial excitement and
the feeling that

00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:05.680
you get from there.

00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:08.250
And it just becomes a
song you've heard

00:38:08.250 --> 00:38:11.210
too much on the radio.

00:38:11.210 --> 00:38:16.890
But to begin with, when I first
came up with that, I

00:38:16.890 --> 00:38:20.330
just, I don't know, smiling
to myself, it

00:38:20.330 --> 00:38:21.580
just sounded so good.

00:38:24.330 --> 00:38:25.950
I like making something up.

00:38:25.950 --> 00:38:29.195
And I enjoy it for the
first hour or so.

00:38:29.195 --> 00:38:30.750
BRADY HARAN: I've made a little
list here of some of

00:38:30.750 --> 00:38:34.293
the other bits of music that I
particularly enjoy, because I

00:38:34.293 --> 00:38:36.450
just wanted to ask you a bit
about the making of them.

00:38:36.450 --> 00:38:37.160
ALAN STEWART: Yeah.

00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:39.510
BRADY HARAN: Our "Good
Will Hunting" video.

00:38:39.510 --> 00:38:42.150
Because we made a video about
mathematics in "Good Will

00:38:42.150 --> 00:38:45.510
Hunting." I emailed and said
basically, can you make

00:38:45.510 --> 00:38:47.682
something that sounds like the
theme music from "Good Will

00:38:47.682 --> 00:38:51.400
Hunting?" Because I can't
use the actual music.

00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:53.486
And you came up with this.

00:38:53.486 --> 00:38:57.680
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:38:57.680 --> 00:38:59.520
BRADY HARAN: Which
I really liked.

00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:02.390
It really sounds like the theme
of "Good Will Hunting,"

00:39:02.390 --> 00:39:06.150
without being it.

00:39:06.150 --> 00:39:07.620
Tell us about how you
came up with that,

00:39:07.620 --> 00:39:08.560
because I'm really curious.

00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:09.460
ALAN STEWART: Yeah.

00:39:09.460 --> 00:39:12.340
So I mean I've seen "Good Will
Hunting." But I can't say I

00:39:12.340 --> 00:39:13.690
remembered the music.

00:39:13.690 --> 00:39:14.380
So I went on YouTube.

00:39:14.380 --> 00:39:16.470
And I just searched for
the theme tune.

00:39:16.470 --> 00:39:21.080
And I listened to it probably
for about an hour just in the

00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:22.580
background, just having
it there.

00:39:22.580 --> 00:39:25.850
I felt like I was trying
to soak it up.

00:39:25.850 --> 00:39:30.090
And there were certain parts of
it-- because it's quite a

00:39:30.090 --> 00:39:32.030
complicated piece of music.

00:39:32.030 --> 00:39:33.380
There's loads going on.

00:39:33.380 --> 00:39:35.365
And it's a bit crazy.

00:39:35.365 --> 00:39:39.000
But there were parts of it that
I thought I can emulate

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:42.770
what Danny Elfman, the composer,
has done here.

00:39:42.770 --> 00:39:46.240
So there's the high-pitched,
piccolo-like

00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:47.640
sound at the beginning.

00:39:47.640 --> 00:39:49.650
And then there's also something
quite beautiful

00:39:49.650 --> 00:39:53.580
about it, but also something
slightly discordant.

00:39:53.580 --> 00:39:57.890
Like in the introduction, those
piano chords are not

00:39:57.890 --> 00:40:00.650
what I would think of
as normal chords.

00:40:00.650 --> 00:40:02.780
They're a bit dissonant.

00:40:02.780 --> 00:40:03.990
They're a bit odd.

00:40:03.990 --> 00:40:09.920
So taking all those different
bits that I soaked up from it,

00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:11.040
I just tried to write something

00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:11.930
that sounded similar.

00:40:11.930 --> 00:40:25.651
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:40:25.651 --> 00:40:27.720
BRADY HARAN: When you listen
to something for a hour,

00:40:27.720 --> 00:40:32.330
though, like when a song gets
stuck in your head, how do you

00:40:32.330 --> 00:40:34.370
stop that being so stuck in
your head that you can be

00:40:34.370 --> 00:40:35.120
original with it?

00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:37.810
ALAN STEWART: I think the "Good
Will Hunting" theme tune

00:40:37.810 --> 00:40:41.485
is quite unique in that, even
after listening to it for an

00:40:41.485 --> 00:40:45.130
hour, I still find it quite
unpredictable, because it is

00:40:45.130 --> 00:40:47.670
such an interesting, rich
piece of music.

00:40:47.670 --> 00:40:49.230
There's so much going
on in it.

00:40:52.910 --> 00:40:55.570
Actually, that's why I had to
listen to it for so long.

00:40:55.570 --> 00:40:59.690
Because normally if I hear a
song four or five times, I can

00:40:59.690 --> 00:41:03.120
usually just play
it after that.

00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:06.450
But yeah, that theme tune
is complicated.

00:41:06.450 --> 00:41:08.320
So I didn't get tired of it.

00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:14.020
BRADY HARAN: Is your mimic, is
your homage to it equally

00:41:14.020 --> 00:41:14.940
unpredictable?

00:41:14.940 --> 00:41:15.870
ALAN STEWART: No.

00:41:15.870 --> 00:41:20.750
My homage to it is simple
by comparison.

00:41:24.470 --> 00:41:27.130
I feel like mine is a little
bit more tuneful.

00:41:27.130 --> 00:41:28.830
There's an actual tune that
you could sing along to.

00:41:28.830 --> 00:41:32.990
Whereas in Danny Elfman's score,
it's quite a random

00:41:32.990 --> 00:41:34.405
piece of music.

00:41:34.405 --> 00:41:38.550
And I challenge anyone to sing
the theme tune to "Good Will

00:41:38.550 --> 00:41:41.210
Hunting." Whereas, I think
mine, you could

00:41:41.210 --> 00:41:42.270
actually sing it back.

00:41:42.270 --> 00:41:42.713
BRADY HARAN: All right.

00:41:42.713 --> 00:41:45.870
Well, if anyone sings the
theme tune to "Good Will

00:41:45.870 --> 00:41:48.352
Hunting," or if they sings
Alan's version of it and post

00:41:48.352 --> 00:41:51.460
it as a video response, I will
allow the video response.

00:41:51.460 --> 00:41:52.040
ALAN STEWART: That'll
be great.

00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:53.450
BRADY HARAN: Because that
would be quite a sight.

00:41:53.450 --> 00:41:54.210
ALAN STEWART: It would.

00:41:54.210 --> 00:41:55.220
It's such a weird piece.

00:41:55.220 --> 00:42:05.445
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:42:05.445 --> 00:42:07.390
BRADY HARAN: Well, another
piece of music, this is

00:42:07.390 --> 00:42:10.210
actually more of a project
that you did quite

00:42:10.210 --> 00:42:13.250
independently of what
I was doing.

00:42:13.250 --> 00:42:15.365
And that's the "Dragon
Curve" music.

00:42:15.365 --> 00:42:16.410
ALAN STEWART: Oh, yeah.

00:42:16.410 --> 00:42:19.390
BRADY HARAN: Obviously, we did
a video about the "Dragon

00:42:19.390 --> 00:42:22.260
Curve." And there are
other animations

00:42:22.260 --> 00:42:22.870
that have been done.

00:42:22.870 --> 00:42:25.850
And you contacted the animator
and you made your own piece of

00:42:25.850 --> 00:42:26.990
music to that animation.

00:42:26.990 --> 00:42:27.590
ALAN STEWART: Hmm.

00:42:27.590 --> 00:42:28.900
BRADY HARAN: And then we sort
of brought it all together

00:42:28.900 --> 00:42:30.040
into a Numberphile video.

00:42:30.040 --> 00:42:31.035
ALAN STEWART: Yeah.

00:42:31.035 --> 00:42:33.630
BRADY HARAN: That's obviously a
really nice piece of music.

00:42:33.630 --> 00:42:35.380
Is that mathematical
or inspired?

00:42:35.380 --> 00:42:39.135
Or was that just you making
a nice piece of music?

00:42:39.135 --> 00:42:43.140
ALAN STEWART: I'd say that the
mathematical link is even

00:42:43.140 --> 00:42:46.510
weaker than the pi song,
Fibonacci song.

00:42:46.510 --> 00:42:51.410
But to me, it does reflect
things about the curve, about

00:42:51.410 --> 00:42:55.230
the shape, the way it unfolds.

00:42:55.230 --> 00:43:00.030
There are parts of it that, to
me, do connect with the shape.

00:43:00.030 --> 00:43:13.476
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:43:13.476 --> 00:43:15.070
ALAN STEWART: It's quite
difficult to explain.

00:43:15.070 --> 00:43:18.140
But one thing, actually,
about the

00:43:18.140 --> 00:43:20.770
animation is that it rotates.

00:43:20.770 --> 00:43:22.840
And so in my head, I had
the idea of circles.

00:43:22.840 --> 00:43:24.990
And in music, there's
this thing called

00:43:24.990 --> 00:43:26.800
the Circle of Fifths.

00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:30.760
And I wanted to use the Circle
of Fifths somewhere in the

00:43:30.760 --> 00:43:37.150
song to reflect that rotation
of the animation.

00:43:37.150 --> 00:43:39.370
There was something about the
animation that just looked

00:43:39.370 --> 00:43:41.750
like the original one that
looked quite lonely.

00:43:41.750 --> 00:43:46.080
And it was just a fractal
forming slowly in

00:43:46.080 --> 00:43:47.970

that sounded lonely.

carry on talking?

00:44:01.060 --> 00:44:02.790
BRADY HARAN: Nah, you
can stop now.

00:44:02.790 --> 00:44:03.120
ALAN STEWART: Yeah.

00:44:03.120 --> 00:44:05.590
BRADY HARAN: One more thing, and
this is not Numberphile.

00:44:05.590 --> 00:44:07.370
It wasn't for a Numberphile
video.

00:44:07.370 --> 00:44:08.810
It was for a Deep Sky Video.

00:44:08.810 --> 00:44:09.410
ALAN STEWART: Yeah.

00:44:09.410 --> 00:44:11.060
BRADY HARAN: And as far as I,
know there's no math or

00:44:11.060 --> 00:44:12.010
science involved.

00:44:12.010 --> 00:44:15.830
But it's actually my favorite
piece of music that you've

00:44:15.830 --> 00:44:17.275
made for me.

00:44:17.275 --> 00:44:20.060
So I wanted to ask you about
it and hear a bit about the

00:44:20.060 --> 00:44:21.810
story from your end.

00:44:21.810 --> 00:44:24.840
And that's a piece of music that
you called "Time Passes."

00:44:24.840 --> 00:44:25.460
ALAN STEWART: Oh, yes.

00:44:25.460 --> 00:44:27.930
BRADY HARAN: I'll tell
it from my end first.

00:44:27.930 --> 00:44:30.180
Basically, I was in Paris.

00:44:30.180 --> 00:44:33.430
And I went to Charles
Messier's grave.

00:44:33.430 --> 00:44:35.558
And I'm going to stop now,
because the battery is about

00:44:35.558 --> 00:44:35.780
to run out.

00:44:35.780 --> 00:44:36.970
I'm going to change the
battery in the camera.

00:44:36.970 --> 00:44:39.375
As I was saying,
I was in Paris.

00:44:39.375 --> 00:44:42.130
And I went to Charles
Messier's grave.

00:44:42.130 --> 00:44:45.010
And I wanted a piece of music to
reflect us walking through

00:44:45.010 --> 00:44:46.430
the cemetery.

00:44:46.430 --> 00:44:47.470
And I emailed to you.

00:44:47.470 --> 00:44:48.190
ALAN STEWART: Uh-huh.

00:44:48.190 --> 00:44:50.200
BRADY HARAN: Basically I just
said, I've just been walking

00:44:50.200 --> 00:44:51.440
through a cemetery.

00:44:51.440 --> 00:44:53.400
And I want a piece of music that
shows me walking through

00:44:53.400 --> 00:44:54.430
a cemetery.

00:44:54.430 --> 00:44:59.570
And really quickly, while I was
still in the hotel, you

00:44:59.570 --> 00:45:03.600
sent me a few options
from memory.

00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:05.590
And I really liked
all of them.

00:45:05.590 --> 00:45:06.720
They were all really lovely.

00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:07.940
I could have used any of them.

00:45:07.940 --> 00:45:09.696
But in the end, I
used this one.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:45:20.720 --> 00:45:23.684
BRADY HARAN: I thought
I read about it.

00:45:23.684 --> 00:45:27.636
Straight ahead to the right of
the monument, and then right.

00:45:34.058 --> 00:45:36.480
BRADY HARAN: What happened when
I sent you this email to

result in these pieces
of music?

00:45:37.845 --> 00:45:40.990
ALAN STEWART: I think I find
it easier to write

00:45:40.990 --> 00:45:42.870
sad-sounding music.

00:45:42.870 --> 00:45:44.460
So you said you were
in a cemetery.

00:45:44.460 --> 00:45:47.115
So I thought, it's
got to sound sad.

00:45:47.115 --> 00:45:49.980
You also said that the video
was going to feature you

00:45:49.980 --> 00:45:51.470
traveling to the place.

00:45:51.470 --> 00:45:54.620
So I wanted something that had a
bit of movement to it, a bit

00:45:54.620 --> 00:45:59.150
of motion, which is why it's
got a fairly fast pulse.

00:45:59.150 --> 00:46:01.440
It's like a ticking
of a clock.

00:46:01.440 --> 00:46:05.080
And that's why I called it
"Time Passes" as well.

00:46:05.080 --> 00:46:06.700
BRADY HARAN: Well, I liked it.

00:46:06.700 --> 00:46:07.165

the bits of music you have

made for the Numberphile

00:46:31.230 --> 00:46:33.990
I know from the comments under
the videos that people

00:46:33.990 --> 00:46:37.230
watching also enjoy them.

00:46:37.230 --> 00:46:40.440
And a final reminder, ALANKEY86

00:46:40.440 --> 00:46:41.590
is the YouTube channel.

00:46:41.590 --> 00:46:43.480
Go and subscribe.

00:46:43.480 --> 00:46:45.530
Let me tell you the main reason
I want you subscribe.

00:46:45.530 --> 00:46:49.140
It's because every time I link
to Alan's channel, I get an

00:46:49.140 --> 00:46:52.520
email from him where he says,
oh, five new people have

00:46:52.520 --> 00:46:53.130
subscribed.

00:46:53.130 --> 00:46:55.450
And he gets really excited and
says he knows when I put a

00:46:55.450 --> 00:46:58.270
video up, because he'll have 10
new subscribers or 30 new

00:46:58.270 --> 00:46:59.560
subscribers.

00:46:59.560 --> 00:47:03.940
And I feel a bit disappointed
that so few people subscribe

00:47:03.940 --> 00:47:05.200
after all the hard
work you put in.

00:47:05.200 --> 00:47:08.185
So if a whole bunch of you go
and subscribe, well, that

00:47:08.185 --> 00:47:09.220
would be good, wouldn't it?

00:47:09.220 --> 00:47:10.060

Why should they subscribe,
though?

00:47:12.900 --> 00:47:15.660
They shouldn't just do it
to be nice to me or you.

00:47:15.660 --> 00:47:16.830
What are they going
to get if they do?

ALAN STEWART: They will
get piano music.

I try and upload maybe once a
week or once a fortnight,

00:47:24.050 --> 00:47:26.960
something I've written,
some composition.

little teaser, I know, because

we were talking off camera,
that Alan is working on a

hopefully might appear

secure the rights.

And you're doing them with
Professor Phil Moriarty, who

also appears in Numberphile
in Sixty Symbols.

of a preview.

are different.

its craziness.

So that will be coming soon.

So stay tuned to Numberphile and
Sixty Symbols, but also to

a lot of his raw material.
