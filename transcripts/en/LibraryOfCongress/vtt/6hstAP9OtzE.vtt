00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:04.620
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:23.960
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Good
evening everybody.

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.450
We are so pleased to have you hear

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:28.940
for this very exciting
concert tonight.

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:32.880
I am here with three amazing
musicians that you will get

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.860
to hear doing lots of different
things, lots of different types

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:38.910
of music, just kind of
in extraordinary ways.

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.310
They are with the ensemble
Either/Or.

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:47.100
And we have Taka Kigawa, Richard
Carrick, who is a director

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.640
and conductor and also
represented as a composer tonight.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.250
And then Jennifer Choi.

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:56.280
And so please join
me in welcoming them.

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.120
&gt;&gt; Richard Carrick: Thank you.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.600
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Choi: Thank you.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.190
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: So I
think the first question

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:08.530
that I have is the one that
is on all of our minds.

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:10.690
Is it either or, either or.

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:14.380 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Richard Carrick: It is either way
you would like to say it [laughter].

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.290
So if that gives you a hint.

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:19.590
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Excellent.

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:20.890
How did. Could you
say just a little bit

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:22.580
about how the ensemble
came together?

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:23.910
And.

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:25.210
&gt;&gt; Richard Carrick: Oh sure.

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.470
So the ensemble we started in 2004.

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.540
It is co-directed by David
Shively, a fabulous percussionist

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.860
and curator, who is
not here tonight.

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:41.010
But we started the group quite
small with three musicians.

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:42.670
And we were really.

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:45.100
We had moved back to New York.

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.190
We were in UCSD San Diego
doing our Ph.D. in D.M.A.'s.

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.380
And when we moved back to New York,
I had lived in New York before

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:58.080
and I was not necessarily always
hearing the music I wanted to hear.

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.110
And I thought well let's just
start playing some of the stuff

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.590
that we do not hear
that often in New York.

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.500
And that was the, that was
the beginning of the group.

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.400
And David and I worked
very closely to kind

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:16.480
of develop this strange repertoire
that we have been developing.

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:22.010
And as we kept going, the group
got bigger and we were able

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.400
to do larger shows and very
fortunate to be able to bring

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.100
on these incredible musicians.

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:29.740
You have been.

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:31.770
Jennifer Choi has been
with us for 10 years now.

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.070
We are very excited.

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:34.370
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Choi: That is right.

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:35.670
This is the 10 year anniversary.

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:36.970
I am really excited.

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.280
And also it has been 17 years
since the first time I played

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:41.580
at the Library of Congress too.

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.370
So I am feeling really special
today, like extremely special.

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.180
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: And what did
you do when you were here before?

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:47.480
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Choi: That was the.

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:48.970
There was a John Zorn portrait.

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:50.730
I do not know if any
of you were here then.

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.030
But it was.

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:53.440
Was it 1999 or 2000?

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.190
I think it was 2000.

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.500
But. And we played the
violin/piano duo [inaudible].

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:59.800
Were you here for that?

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.410
Oh wow. So hello again [laughter].

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:02.880
That is great.

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.180
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: You have
got a dedicated audience.

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:05.480
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Choi: Yeah.

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:06.780
It is amazing.

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.080
And so it is a really
special day for me.

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:09.380
&gt;&gt; Richard Carrick: Fantastic.

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.930
And then Taka you must
have joined like about?

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.670
&gt;&gt; Taka Kigawa: Compared to
Jennifer, I am kind of new.

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:15.970
Just two or three years.

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:17.270
I am very new.

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:18.570
&gt;&gt; Richard Carrick:
But we are very happy.

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.560
And Taka has been amazing as
a chamber musician and also

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.210
as a soloist, which you
will get to hear tonight.

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:24.940
And Jennifer also a
fabulous soloist.

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.220
So the group kind of keeps growing
and now we do mixed concerts,

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.830
either with conducted
chamber ensemble,

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:34.820
small chamber orchestra size,

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:38.110
as well as pretty intense
kind of chamber music.

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:40.380
So you will hear a little
bit of both tonight.

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:41.680
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: And
I think that is one

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.100
of the fascinating
things about this evening.

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:44.620
I think you will agree
with me after you hear it.

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:49.500 position:56%
Is that there is this great
variety of instrumentation and types

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.030
of music that you will hear.

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.320
But it actually coheres
I think really well.

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.780
I am assuming that is just
because of great programming.

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:58.080
But. So that.

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:59.410
But it is really something.

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:02.740
And I thought maybe we could
talk a bit about the program

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:06.340
and you know just kind of get
into each piece a little bit,

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.590
maybe starting with the
first one, the Braxton.

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:11.390
I understand that that has
been quite an experience

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:13.300
to put it together.

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:17.980
A lot of people assume
that you just look at it.

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:21.380 position:56%
If you are not a musician, maybe you
just have a score in front of you

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:24.670
and you use that as a, as a
way to get, you know translate

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:28.080
from what you see on the page
to how you play and that is,

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.420
that is still what you do kind of.

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:32.960
But what is different
about it with the Braxton?

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:34.260
&gt;&gt; Richard Carrick: Yeah.

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:35.560
Well first of all I
would like to point

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.140 position:56%
out that the score is actually here.

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:41.520
So I really encourage all of you
before you walk into the concert

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.040
to please look at the
[inaudible] with any Braxton score.

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.310
There is also some of the Ligeti.

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:49.290
But the Braxton score in particular
is probably something you have not

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:50.740
seen before.

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:54.260
Because he invented it all.

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:58.230
It is amazing this guy, how
he, he comes, he comes from it

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:02.340
from a performers perspective,
from an intellectual perspective,

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:07.260
from a sound perspective
and from a game almost kind

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.100
of like improvising perspective.

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:12.370
And you see that in the score.

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:16.290
So did you want to say a
little bit about the score?

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:17.590
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Choi: Sure.

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:21.130
So this is his composition
number 222.

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:25.980
And he, he wrote this in 1995.

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:28.890
And it was, it was after
he was, he went to a course

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:30.830
on Native American music.

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:36.790
So he called it the Ghost Trance
Music -- this particular piece.

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:42.240
And he was really interested in
the ritual dance music and music

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.490
for other purposes than
just in the concert hall.

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:45.890
So he is going for that.

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:49.030
And then there is specific
symbols, like circles and triangles

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:51.140
and squares that come
out of a note head.

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:53.570
And that is where we are
supposed to start improvising.

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:57.440
And then we have to find each other
also in the score out of that.

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.080
And come back to the Ghost Trance.

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:02.660
So the piece actually could
go on for about 24 hours.

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:04.960
We have to do it today
in like 10 minutes

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:07.120
or something like that [laughter].

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:08.630
But that is what he wants.

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:10.200
He wants you to.

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:11.880
You do not have to play all 30.

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:13.410
There is 30 pages or 33.

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:14.760
I forget how many pages now.

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:16.060
Yeah there is 33.

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:17.360
There is no way we could do all 33.

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:18.660
He does not expect you to.

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:20.170
But you do have to
make some choices.

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:23.070
And that can be either
very, very difficult or.

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:27.240
I actually think that is
difficult to make these choices

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:28.540
with the material that is given.

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:30.140
But that is what we had to do.

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:31.440
&gt;&gt; Richard Carrick: Yeah.

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:34.370
And one of the things he does
is he sets up many paradigms.

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:36.490
So you can, you can pick and choice

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:38.490
at different points
what you want to do.

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:41.530
But you do not know what the
other person is going to do.

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:45.860
And for example, there is a
symbol, which is a circle.

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:47.610
He might attach it to a note.

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:50.360
But then there is also a
symbol, which is a triangle.

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:52.210
And there is a symbol
that is a square.

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:55.040 position:56%
They all look pretty similar, right?

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:59.030
But the circle means you improvise.

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:05.380
The triangle means you stop playing
that piece and you immediately go

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:10.360
to another piece that he has
written in composition 222.

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:14.490
And the square means you
can stop playing that piece

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:19.010
and immediately play any other
piece he has written [laughter].

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:25.380
So it is pretty open.

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:29.950
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Choi: And actually
in the case there is a score

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:31.260
of the tertiary material.

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.690
It is numbered one,
two, three and four.

00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:37.270
So those are more specific
and he wants you to go

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:40.230
through them like note by note.

00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:42.100
So we do. We chose.

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:44.970
I will just give you the secret in.

00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:46.790
But we chose two of
them to play tonight.

00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:48.280
Not all four.

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:49.580
You can guess which two.

00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:53.570
But they are all displayed there
in the cabinet, which is nice.

00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:56.140
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: So if you
can go to these other pieces,

00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:58.880
does he do anything special
with the clefs or something?

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:02.500
Or can you just pick any
line from those pieces?

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:03.800
Or?

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:05.100
&gt;&gt; Richard Carrick: Yeah.

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:06.400
He. He believes that all
of his music can be played

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:08.630
on all instruments at any time.

00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:11.650
So he has got this really
interesting synthesis.

00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:14.610
Braxton comes from many
traditions you know.

00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:18.310
Some of you are probably thinking
oh this relates to Cage in a way.

00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:21.270
The improvisation thing might
come out of a jazz tradition.

00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:24.480
Stockhausen was a big
influence on him.

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:26.590
And he cites that in
a number of examples.

00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:31.460
So he is really going deeper with
a lot of these ideas that were

00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:32.760
around when he was performing.

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:34.160
He is an incredible musician.

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:37.880
And, and he would just kind

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:40.210
of put them all together
in this unique way.

00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:44.600
So how do you notate for
any instrument at any time.

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:49.520
So you still use the five line
staff, but he uses his own clef.

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:52.480
And you can do it in treble clef.

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:53.780
You can do it in base clef.

00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:56.040
You can do it in treble clef
three octaves higher or lower.

00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:57.340
You can do it in alto clef.

00:08:57.340 --> 00:09:01.810
You can switch from one note to
tenor to soprano to alto clef.

00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:04.230
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Choi: And that
is called the diamond clef.

00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:06.380 position:56%
And you will see the diamond, right?

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:08.160
&gt;&gt; Richard Carrick: And he also
does that with accidentals.

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:10.450
He has a star accidental.

00:09:10.450 --> 00:09:11.750
It could be a flat.

00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:13.050
It could be a natural.

00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:14.350
It could be a sharp.

00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:17.430
And we do not know what
each other are going to do.

00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:18.730
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Do you find

00:09:18.730 --> 00:09:20.650
that you play it differently
as you are doing it?

00:09:20.650 --> 00:09:25.910
Or do you, do some mapping
and some spontaneous choices?

00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:27.210
Or?

00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:30.150
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Choi: Yes
and no [laughter].

00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:32.490
Because either way can
be frustrating, right?

00:09:32.490 --> 00:09:34.310
So you are trying to play
everything on the page

00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:36.770
and that almost got more
frustrating for some reason.

00:09:36.770 --> 00:09:40.360
Then when we decided to open it up
-- oh that sounds good for today.

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:43.380
And then we tried the open way
to, you know in the next rehearsal

00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:45.360
and it was oh well it
sounded better yesterday.

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:46.660
I wonder why?

00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:47.960
So I do not know.

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:50.080
Maybe he wants you to just
be listening constantly

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:54.390
and on a dime have to be able
to switch, devise some structure

00:09:54.390 --> 00:09:55.890
within the piece by yourself.

00:09:55.890 --> 00:09:58.670 position:56%
And definitely interpret,
interpret, interpret the whole time.

00:09:58.670 --> 00:09:59.970
So.

00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:01.270 position:56%
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Well that is great.

00:10:01.270 --> 00:10:02.730
I should mention that this
piece that we are going

00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:04.920
to hear tonight was commissioned
by the Library of Congress,

00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:07.500
The McKim Fund in the
Library of Congress.

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:09.050
So we are very excited
to have it played.

00:10:09.050 --> 00:10:11.090
I do not believe it has
been played in Coolidge

00:10:11.090 --> 00:10:14.840 position:56%
since it was premiered here in 1998.

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:16.590
So this will be a treat.

00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:18.260
&gt;&gt; Richard Carrick: Well it is
an honor for us to play it here.

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.880
We are really excited.

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:22.660
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Well
the next piece that comes

00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:26.480
up on the program is
one of Richard's pieces.

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:28.230
And maybe you can just
give us a little bit.

00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:30.720
I understand that this piece
has multiple [inaudible]

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:33.940
in which can be performed.

00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:35.240
&gt;&gt; Richard Carrick: Oh right.

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:37.520
So this. I was very interested in.

00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:41.900
you know most of the
composers on tonight's program

00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:44.830
as well reflect this as
a systems based approach.

00:10:44.830 --> 00:10:49.460
So you kind of have a logical
form and a logical way of dealing

00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:51.680
with pitches and kind
of working things out

00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:56.420
and creating incredible color
and intensity through that.

00:10:56.420 --> 00:10:57.720
And in this.

00:10:57.720 --> 00:10:59.670
I come out of that
tradition compositionally.

00:10:59.670 --> 00:11:07.320 position:56%
But in this piece, I was very
interested in creating descriptions.

00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:08.620
I was influenced.

00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:13.200
You can read in the program
notes, but I was influenced

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:17.260
by [inaudible] the stranger and
specifically the scene the end

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:23.730
of the first chapter or the
first part where [inaudible] is

00:11:23.730 --> 00:11:27.300
on the beach and he
sees the stranger.

00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:29.740
And then there is this, this.

00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:31.550
He sees the sun.

00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:34.130
He sees the sweat.

00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:36.440
And the shimmering light.

00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:40.940
And he has this act,
this murderous act.

00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:44.950
And the intensity, in which
that scene begins is incredible

00:11:44.950 --> 00:11:49.090
because it begins on this
beautiful beach in Algeria.

00:11:49.090 --> 00:11:50.390
And it is very calm.

00:11:50.390 --> 00:11:52.010
And there is somebody in the back.

00:11:52.010 --> 00:11:54.790
And this is the only time music
is referenced in the whole book.

00:11:54.790 --> 00:11:59.460
There is someone playing
an out of tuned flute.

00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:02.120
And they are only kind of
getting three notes out of it.

00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:05.120
And they are just kind of
cycling through these three notes.

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:07.250
And I thought that is a
fascinating place to start.

00:12:07.250 --> 00:12:11.450
So I kind of put the flute
as the description of kind

00:12:11.450 --> 00:12:12.860
of what is going on around there.

00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:16.160
And then I had the cello and
base clarinet representing kind

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:18.950
of the inner turmoil of the scene.

00:12:18.950 --> 00:12:23.880
So one is expressing the outward
serenity or absurdity and the.

00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:29.290
And then the lower instruments
are kind of the emotional grit.

00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:31.330
And these two kind of coincide.

00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:34.770
They first start off very
separately and they come together.

00:12:34.770 --> 00:12:36.230
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: You know one
thing I noticed just listening

00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:39.500
in rehearsal was that --
[clears throat] excuse me.

00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:42.670
As you mentioned, there is this.

00:12:42.670 --> 00:12:48.650
You have these pairs and they are
actually often playing near unison

00:12:48.650 --> 00:12:51.860
duet type materials together.

00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:54.630
But they are just slightly,
like the [inaudible]

00:12:54.630 --> 00:12:58.800
of the flute is a slightly off
in terms of pitch maybe, but.

00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:02.070 position:56%
Or doing slightly more ornamentation
or something like that.

00:13:02.070 --> 00:13:03.370
&gt;&gt; Richard Carrick: Right.

00:13:03.370 --> 00:13:06.390
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Almost like a
camouflage type of [laughter].

00:13:06.390 --> 00:13:07.690
But

00:13:07.690 --> 00:13:08.990
&gt;&gt; Richard Carrick: I
have not heard that.

00:13:08.990 --> 00:13:10.290
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: But.

00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:12.370
Can you say a bit more about that?

00:13:12.370 --> 00:13:16.150
Because I think that is a
really intriguing aspect of it.

00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:17.450
&gt;&gt; Richard Carrick: Well.

00:13:17.450 --> 00:13:19.790
So the flute does this thing
where the flute is out of tune,

00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:24.320
but then the piano is kind of
in and out of that tuning world.

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:28.550
And so you know sometimes it
sounds like the flute is in tune

00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:31.080
and the piano might be out of tune.

00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:36.360
And getting into this place where
it kind of dimensionalises each

00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:38.330 position:56%
of the characters a little bit more.

00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:42.390 position:56%
So you are not just playing together
all the time, but you are kind of.

00:13:42.390 --> 00:13:46.290
There is a similarity here with
the Braxton I think you know.

00:13:46.290 --> 00:13:47.990
And you will hear it,
I think in terms

00:13:47.990 --> 00:13:50.370
of the continuity of the concert.

00:13:50.370 --> 00:13:54.180
The parts are all notated in my
piece, but we are kind of going in

00:13:54.180 --> 00:13:58.730
and out of each other
compositionally and sonically.

00:13:58.730 --> 00:14:00.060
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: It is a
really beautiful piece.

00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:03.380
Do you. You also have it
for another arrangement?

00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:04.680
&gt;&gt; Richard Carrick: Right
it was originally written

00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:06.780
for a piccolo and cello.

00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:09.310
And then we actually.

00:14:09.310 --> 00:14:13.580 position:56%
We premiered it on violin and piano.

00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:17.100
And tenor saxophone and
musical saw [laughter].

00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:21.710
And in this version it
is for flute and piano.

00:14:21.710 --> 00:14:23.550
And base clarinet and cello.

00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:25.130
So. But again this.

00:14:25.130 --> 00:14:26.710
There is this interesting thing

00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:30.280
where these melodies
and these fragments are.

00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:32.670
They are interesting in themselves,

00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:35.960
but it is actually every
instrument can bring so much color

00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:37.560
and difference into the quality.

00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:38.860
So that is why I have been.

00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:41.050
I do not do it that often,
but in this particular case,

00:14:41.050 --> 00:14:43.960
I have orchestrated it
for different instruments.

00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:47.980
And explored the richnesses
of those instruments.

00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:49.280
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Fantastic.

00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:55.700
So the. Maybe we can talk about
the four as the two together.

00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:58.960
Because they are two
remarkably pieces

00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:01.900
in very different ways I
think that you will find.

00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:03.200
One is kind of.

00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:06.820
I think one his classic works
now is Spur that we will hear

00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:08.620
at the end of the first half.

00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:09.920
And the other.

00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:12.780
This is the D.C. premier I
think of a clarinet quintet.

00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:14.750
So the first one is for
piano and string quartet.

00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:21.000
And the other one is for
clarinet and string quartet.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.140
There is a lot to say
about these pieces.

00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:25.740
But maybe one thing
that strikes me is

00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:27.890
that although they
are very different.

00:15:27.890 --> 00:15:32.550
The first one is almost full of
phrenetic activity and energy.

00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:35.130
The second one does not
seem to be at first.

00:15:35.130 --> 00:15:39.850
But yet there is this kind of
latent energy in both that.

00:15:39.850 --> 00:15:44.160
So maybe you can speak about what
is like to perform these pieces.

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:49.800
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Choi: Taka, you want
to say something about Spur?

00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:51.100
[Inaudible].

00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:53.140
&gt;&gt; Richard Carrick: Starting off
by saying something about Spur.

00:15:53.140 --> 00:16:00.750 position:56%
Spur is a piece where the piano part
is rapid 30 second notes throughout.

00:16:00.750 --> 00:16:05.460
And the string quartet are also
kind of this dual personality.

00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:07.060
They are completely integrated,

00:16:07.060 --> 00:16:09.980
but they almost never
play exactly the same.

00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:11.280
It is. It is.

00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:12.690
It is incredibly difficult.

00:16:12.690 --> 00:16:15.780
Because you know normally
you have downbeats together

00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:17.080
or something like that.

00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:19.160
And he does not do
that in this piece.

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:23.960
So it is kind of a meta-listening,
I think is happening here.

00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:25.260
&gt;&gt; Taka Kigawa: Yeah.

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:27.780
It is also interesting to know
that he put specific [inaudible]

00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:30.470
for piano and the string quartet.

00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:33.860
He did not put for piano quintet.

00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:37.340
So piano and string
quartet playing together.

00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:41.860
But I always feel like when
the performers are rehearsing,

00:16:41.860 --> 00:16:43.160
where am I?

00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:44.530 position:56%
Am I playing with the string quartet

00:16:44.530 --> 00:16:49.590
or very string quartet those
four boys and girls playing here?

00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:51.800
But I am like here.

00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:55.170
We are together, but at
the same time not together.

00:16:55.170 --> 00:16:58.420
Very peculiar experience anytime.

00:16:58.420 --> 00:17:02.300
Yeah. Sometimes I feel like when
discussing string [inaudible]

00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:06.710
discussing phrasing or [inaudible],
I feel like I am nowhere.

00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:08.270
I feel so helpless.

00:17:08.270 --> 00:17:11.700
But at the same time, we
are really playing together.

00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:13.670
So very strange feeling.

00:17:13.670 --> 00:17:16.250
&gt;&gt; Richard Carrick: So if you were
off, it would definitely feel off.

00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:18.200
So it [inaudible] where
you have to be exactly

00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:19.960
on for it to feel correctly off.

00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:21.660
&gt;&gt; Taka Kigawa: Exactly [laughter].

00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:23.240
Very, very right.

00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:25.930
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Choi: And I think
that is, that is how he works.

00:17:25.930 --> 00:17:29.760
We had. Each of us has
had a opportunity to work

00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:31.380
with him on a different level.

00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:35.400
And when he came to New York City,
I was doing a large ensemble piece.

00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:37.820
So we had pretty much
a full orchestra.

00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:42.650
And he was so specific about
every dynamic that he wants.

00:17:42.650 --> 00:17:43.950
Every nuance.

00:17:43.950 --> 00:17:45.660
Every extended technique.

00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:47.540
And I was sitting, I
think, somewhere in the back

00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:49.230
of the first violin somewhere.

00:17:49.230 --> 00:17:50.530
The very back.

00:17:50.530 --> 00:17:52.820
And he is listening from
kind of inside the orchestra.

00:17:52.820 --> 00:17:54.820
And he said, okay everybody stop.

00:17:54.820 --> 00:17:58.300 position:56%
And he pointed me out and he said,
you are playing too loud [laughter].

00:17:58.300 --> 00:18:01.630
It was like well everything
was supposed to be PP

00:18:01.630 --> 00:18:02.930
or PPP or PPPP, whatever.

00:18:02.930 --> 00:18:05.330
But he could hear that.

00:18:05.330 --> 00:18:09.460
So that is the extent of
how meticulously he writes.

00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:12.940 position:56%
Now you might listen to it and
think oh well you know this could be

00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:14.240
like an improvised thing.

00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:15.540
We have a lot of Pizzicato's

00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:17.500
and like you know somebody
plays here and then here.

00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:19.150
It is like doot, doot,
doot, like that.

00:18:19.150 --> 00:18:20.450
But it is not.

00:18:20.450 --> 00:18:23.960
It is like you have to
really have it in your body.

00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:25.260
The rhythm in your body.

00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:27.510
So for that piece for sure.

00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:29.350 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Richard Carrick: You know another
interesting thing about this piece

00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:33.640
that I was mentioning to Taka
earlier that in a lot of, of,

00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:37.460
for his piano music, he tends
to do these kind of octave,

00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:41.320
splaying octaves that go across
the compass of the keyboard.

00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:44.050
But also in, almost intentional,

00:18:44.050 --> 00:18:46.190
well obviously intentional
because he writes it.

00:18:46.190 --> 00:18:48.560
But not wrong notes.

00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:53.170
But kind of moving away from
some sort of octave center.

00:18:53.170 --> 00:18:55.470
So in this case, it
might be a minor ninth,

00:18:55.470 --> 00:18:57.260
it might be a major
seventh somewhere.

00:18:57.260 --> 00:18:59.840
But there is this kind of gradual
type of thing that always tends

00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:02.350
to snap back until finally
it shifts or something.

00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:06.210 position:56%
And it is kind of this amazing thing
to listen to over time, I think.

00:19:06.210 --> 00:19:07.510
And it is.

00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:13.590
So I am really excited about it.

00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:16.120
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: How
would you categorize.

00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:17.420
Or not categorize.

00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:22.600
But think about the clarinet
quintet compared to that piece?

00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:23.900
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Choi: Okay.

00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:27.310
So in the clarinet quintet,
which was written in 2013,

00:19:27.310 --> 00:19:30.140
he is exploring something
completely different.

00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:33.580
So he is. He wants to stretch
time, especially in the beginning.

00:19:33.580 --> 00:19:34.880
He wants the whole.

00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:37.190
The whole piece is around
30 minutes actually.

00:19:37.190 --> 00:19:40.100
In the first 15 minutes,
that is half of the piece,

00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:45.550
he is trying to do
everything in slow motion.

00:19:45.550 --> 00:19:46.850
That is the whole point.

00:19:46.850 --> 00:19:49.950
And Interno al Bianco [assumed
spelling] is, it is a reference

00:19:49.950 --> 00:19:51.470
to a piece of literature actually.

00:19:51.470 --> 00:19:52.920
An Italian piece.

00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:56.600
And actually he says it does not
have to do with the actual title.

00:19:56.600 --> 00:20:02.960
But he is exploring light
and all sense of light.

00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:07.380
But you have to imagine in all the
colors and all the distinctions.

00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:10.590
And he is trying to make.

00:20:10.590 --> 00:20:12.490
If light were to sound
like something,

00:20:12.490 --> 00:20:15.020
this is what it would sound like.

00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:20.910
So we are supposed to try to find
this place in our string playing

00:20:20.910 --> 00:20:23.060
and also in the clarinet
where we blend.

00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:25.880
But it is a certain sound that
maybe you have not heard before.

00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:28.050
And he just stays there
for 15 minutes.

00:20:28.050 --> 00:20:29.420
That is, that is a big deal.

00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:30.970 position:56%
And then the piece starts to evolve.

00:20:30.970 --> 00:20:34.600
I do not want to give
everything away [laughter].

00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:36.820
&gt;&gt; Richard Carrick: But one
of the fascinating things

00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:40.260
about that piece -- I, I
hear the piece, I think,

00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:42.420
I think he wrote it
last year actually.

00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:43.720
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Choi: Oh is that right?

00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:45.020
&gt;&gt; Richard Carrick: Because it
was just premiered in September

00:20:45.020 --> 00:20:46.320
and then we premiered in...

00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:47.620
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Choi: Sorry 2015.

00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:49.010
&gt;&gt; Richard Carrick: In the U.S.
a few weeks ago in New York.

00:20:49.010 --> 00:20:51.770
And this is the, as you
said, the D.C. premier.

00:20:51.770 --> 00:20:55.340
And I think it is a
new phase in his music.

00:20:55.340 --> 00:21:00.730
You heard the last few
pieces from 2013 to 16,

00:21:00.730 --> 00:21:03.340
there is a change going
on in his music.

00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:05.980
And in this piece it
is pretty full blown.

00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:12.400
One of the things that happens
is acoustics become so important.

00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:15.960
In the way that in Spur it is all
about these little motives, bop,

00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:18.740
bop, bop, bop, bad da
da, bad da da, you know.

00:21:18.740 --> 00:21:23.140
This kind of phrenetic
micro-intensity throughout the

00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:24.600
whole piece.

00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:30.030
But in Interno, the piece really
opens up and the acoustics

00:21:30.030 --> 00:21:33.200
and the sounds of the instruments,
the way they are interacting

00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:36.780
with each other sonically
is phenomenal.

00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:41.110
It takes such concentration
to kind of play these pieces.

00:21:41.110 --> 00:21:45.400
And there is also something about
how long the piece is you know.

00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:47.930
We tend to hear.

00:21:47.930 --> 00:21:52.260
It is a funny thing, like do you
think you would hear the same.

00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:56.200
Let's say we took the first
30 seconds of a piece.

00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:58.610
I have never tried this before.

00:21:58.610 --> 00:22:01.250
But let's say you take the
first 30 seconds of a piece

00:22:01.250 --> 00:22:03.990
and then you hear it at
the beginning of the piece.

00:22:03.990 --> 00:22:05.570
It means something.

00:22:05.570 --> 00:22:09.990
But if you heard that same
30 seconds three minutes

00:22:09.990 --> 00:22:13.870
into the piece, it might
mean something else depending

00:22:13.870 --> 00:22:15.170
on what came before.

00:22:15.170 --> 00:22:18.530
If you take the first 30 seconds
and you hear it 15 minutes

00:22:18.530 --> 00:22:23.040
into the piece, you could
imagine how that same piece

00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:26.930
of music would have a different
meaning because of its context.

00:22:26.930 --> 00:22:30.510
And I think what he does in
this piece is he stretches

00:22:30.510 --> 00:22:35.770
out the scale a little bit to the
point where we really get lost

00:22:35.770 --> 00:22:38.610
in this slow expansive music.

00:22:38.610 --> 00:22:41.470
We are no longer just
waiting for it to get fast.

00:22:41.470 --> 00:22:43.580
It is. That is where we are.

00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:45.870
And we start to hear the music
differently for that reason.

00:22:45.870 --> 00:22:49.040
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: You know another
thing just to point out, is that,

00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:51.460
as you just said, it
stretches out the scale --

00:22:51.460 --> 00:22:55.860
literally he does that with
the scales going up and down.

00:22:55.860 --> 00:22:58.360
So sometimes they are with
micro tunnel types of.

00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:00.910
They are slow glissandi between,

00:23:00.910 --> 00:23:04.370
which I would imagine would
be difficult to control.

00:23:04.370 --> 00:23:07.160
But there is this kind of.

00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:09.070
And actually the same
kind of thing is happening

00:23:09.070 --> 00:23:11.400
at a much faster rate in Spur.

00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:15.710 position:56%
I think not actually a faster rate,
but just there is this upward motion

00:23:15.710 --> 00:23:17.010
that kind of occurs in both.

00:23:17.010 --> 00:23:20.930
But some of the strings are going
down while the others are going up.

00:23:20.930 --> 00:23:23.760
And it is something that
kind of creates this.

00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:26.920
These moments of interaction
that you can kind of anticipate.

00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:28.220
But you are not quite
sure how he is going

00:23:28.220 --> 00:23:31.180
to handle each interaction
like that.

00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:32.480
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Choi: Exactly.

00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:33.780
&gt;&gt; Richard Carrick: Well the,

00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:35.100
the glissandi that you
are talking about, David,

00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:40.500
is maybe over a six second period
he asks you to do a glissando.

00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:45.490
But it is from E to E
quarter flat [laughter].

00:23:45.490 --> 00:23:48.900
It is not even to E flat.

00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:50.200
So you know.

00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:52.440
And then in rehearsal they
are like I think you got

00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:55.020
to that E quarter flat a little
bit too early [laughter].

00:23:55.020 --> 00:23:58.950
After five seconds instead of six.

00:23:58.950 --> 00:24:00.900
So the level of listening
that is going

00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:03.110 position:56%
on when they play is pretty intense.

00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:04.410
And.

00:24:04.410 --> 00:24:08.470
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: So if you hear
an E flat, it is wrong [laughter].

00:24:08.470 --> 00:24:10.580
So yeah. I mean these are,
these are fantastic pieces.

00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:12.620
I think you are going to
enjoy them a great deal.

00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:16.340
And just before we get to that
final [inaudible] quintet,

00:24:16.340 --> 00:24:19.620
we get to hear a selection
of five Ligeti etudes.

00:24:19.620 --> 00:24:22.130
I have to admit I am
a big Ligeti fan.

00:24:22.130 --> 00:24:25.020
So this is an exciting
moment for me personally just

00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:27.290
to be able to hear these.

00:24:27.290 --> 00:24:31.970
And Taka maybe you can say a bit
about why these particular ones.

00:24:31.970 --> 00:24:36.130
Or just your experience playing
because you play all of the etudes.

00:24:36.130 --> 00:24:40.600
&gt;&gt; Richard Carrick: Taka has given
many performances of the whole set.

00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:44.840
And so we are very excited to
be able to share some of these.

00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:46.140
&gt;&gt; Taka Kigawa: Thank you.

00:24:46.140 --> 00:24:47.440
Tonight five only.

00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:49.400
Sorry [laughter].

00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:53.340
But yes. Like David, I
am a huge Ligeti fan.

00:24:53.340 --> 00:24:57.740
I have been playing this set
of piece more than six years

00:24:57.740 --> 00:24:59.770
or seven years, maybe 10 years.

00:24:59.770 --> 00:25:01.750
As soon as he is published,
I got a score

00:25:01.750 --> 00:25:04.180
and start practicing and enjoying.

00:25:04.180 --> 00:25:08.050
It is so original and
of course difficult.

00:25:08.050 --> 00:25:10.700
I am sure everyone
here, most of you know.

00:25:10.700 --> 00:25:12.360
At the same time, very fun.

00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:13.790
Very rewarding.

00:25:13.790 --> 00:25:15.590
Very good musical experiment.

00:25:15.590 --> 00:25:18.940
Just to practice for
yourself and performance

00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:22.140
in public like festival to me.

00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:24.020
So. And to.

00:25:24.020 --> 00:25:27.940
For this concert, because
of those five pieces,

00:25:27.940 --> 00:25:34.630
I try to pick most
interesting, fun, interactive

00:25:34.630 --> 00:25:37.370
and musically meaningful five.

00:25:37.370 --> 00:25:38.740
So I picked [inaudible].

00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:40.040
And once [inaudible].

00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:41.340
And open strings [inaudible].

00:25:41.340 --> 00:25:45.070
And [inaudible] there
was a staircase.

00:25:45.070 --> 00:25:48.440
These are five difficult pieces.

00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:51.550
Each one is difficult.

00:25:51.550 --> 00:26:02.600
But I try to create a, create a
program of five sets as a coherent

00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:07.710
in terms of how many tempi
[phonetic] and also structure.

00:26:07.710 --> 00:26:10.850
So that is how I chose
those five pieces.

00:26:10.850 --> 00:26:12.940
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: So one thing
I can say that is, maybe,

00:26:12.940 --> 00:26:16.840
at least what I hear from a, at
a surface level is that the first

00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:19.880
and the fifth have a lot
to do with upward scales.

00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:23.450
And the second and the fourth
really emphasize the fifth.

00:26:23.450 --> 00:26:24.930
Not the fifth pieces,
but the interval.

00:26:24.930 --> 00:26:26.230
&gt;&gt; Taka Kigawa: Yeah its interval.

00:26:26.230 --> 00:26:28.600
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: And then
that middle one is just one

00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:31.140
of the great ones and that
is the more descending scale.

00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:32.780
&gt;&gt; Taka Kigawa: All
chromatic descending.

00:26:32.780 --> 00:26:34.720
And also polyrhythm.

00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:37.770
It is a very important factor
when it comes to Ligeti.

00:26:37.770 --> 00:26:41.050
So right hand playing
this rhythm bop, bop, bop.

00:26:41.050 --> 00:26:43.000
Left hand -- dat, dat, dat.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:44.890
And both hands -- dad,
dad, dad, dad, dad.

00:26:44.890 --> 00:26:47.810
So lots of rhythms going on
at the same time [inaudible].

00:26:47.810 --> 00:26:50.210
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: The
layers are incredible

00:26:50.210 --> 00:26:53.270
because you hear these
distinctive scales going down.

00:26:53.270 --> 00:26:57.510
But to imagine playing them
actually is quite something.

00:26:57.510 --> 00:27:01.830
&gt;&gt; Taka Kigawa: So very original
kind of rhythmic in management.

00:27:01.830 --> 00:27:04.410
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: I mentioned to
Richard when we were first talking

00:27:04.410 --> 00:27:08.850 position:56%
about this that when I first got the
music, just to take a look at it.

00:27:08.850 --> 00:27:10.750
The first book -- it was all.

00:27:10.750 --> 00:27:13.740
It was the facsimile of the
hand written manuscript.

00:27:13.740 --> 00:27:15.770
When you learned these, did
you learn from [inaudible]?

00:27:15.770 --> 00:27:17.070
&gt;&gt; Taka Kigawa: Manuscript.

00:27:17.070 --> 00:27:20.050
Yes. So I literally used
a magnifier [laughter]

00:27:20.050 --> 00:27:25.140
because his handwriting is very
small and not so easy to read.

00:27:25.140 --> 00:27:26.440
So.

00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:27.740
&gt;&gt; Richard Carrick: Well
he was one of the composers

00:27:27.740 --> 00:27:31.790
who I do not think anyone
had a ruler in, like when.

00:27:31.790 --> 00:27:33.370
He never used a ruler.

00:27:33.370 --> 00:27:37.210
So every stem kind of
look like a note as well.

00:27:37.210 --> 00:27:40.060
It was incredibly,
incredibly challenging to.

00:27:40.060 --> 00:27:41.360
&gt;&gt; Taka Kigawa: Very challenging.

00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:42.940
&gt;&gt; Richard Carrick: And
tiny, like you said.

00:27:42.940 --> 00:27:44.240
&gt;&gt; Taka Kigawa: Exactly.

00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:46.460
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: So do you
still use that [inaudible].

00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:47.760
&gt;&gt; Taka Kigawa: Oh no.

00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:49.060
I am using a printed out.

00:27:49.060 --> 00:27:50.360
I mean. Yeah.

00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:52.000
Yeah. Just like you
can see in the hallway.

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.050
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: But
there is something

00:27:54.050 --> 00:27:55.980
about reading from a manuscript.

00:27:55.980 --> 00:27:59.680
You get a different, you
get the composers intent.

00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:01.290
You know the way.

00:28:01.290 --> 00:28:03.660
Where they put symbols.

00:28:03.660 --> 00:28:10.040 position:56%
The closer they put it to a note or
how they indicate important moments.

00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:11.560
You get that from the manuscript.

00:28:11.560 --> 00:28:14.270
And then when it is engraved,
you might or might not get it.

00:28:14.270 --> 00:28:18.910
So having started with the
manuscript it is usually more work,

00:28:18.910 --> 00:28:22.260
but it is often more
rewarding in terms of figuring

00:28:22.260 --> 00:28:23.900
out your own personal
interpretation.

00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:26.590
Because you have to not
only play these notes,

00:28:26.590 --> 00:28:29.110
but you have to internalize
them and that is

00:28:29.110 --> 00:28:30.520 position:56%
where the interpretation comes from.

00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:33.380
You have to be yourself
inside of the score.

00:28:33.380 --> 00:28:35.720
&gt;&gt; Taka Kigawa: Oh by the way,
[inaudible] are still using,

00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:37.640
I mean handwriting
[inaudible] computer.

00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:40.290
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: There
is also something

00:28:40.290 --> 00:28:42.480
about Ligeti in terms of the.

00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:43.950
Oh maybe we are going to
get to this in a second.

00:28:43.950 --> 00:28:46.010
But in terms of the program.

00:28:46.010 --> 00:28:51.630
Because I guess his pieces are
probably the oldest pieces.

00:28:51.630 --> 00:28:56.500
But in some ways I feel
like Ligeti's music has.

00:28:56.500 --> 00:29:00.890
You see his effects as a
master composer as someone,

00:29:00.890 --> 00:29:02.380
I think in different ways,

00:29:02.380 --> 00:29:05.810
kind of influenced everyone
else on the program.

00:29:05.810 --> 00:29:08.550
You know, very interesting
because you, you hear the kind

00:29:08.550 --> 00:29:11.080
of perpetual rhythmic
quality in the Braxton.

00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:14.100
You sort of Aldatire
[assumed spelling].

00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:16.110
We have not spoken about her yet.

00:29:16.110 --> 00:29:18.940
But I think she was very
influenced by his more spacial

00:29:18.940 --> 00:29:22.430
and micropolyphony qualities.

00:29:22.430 --> 00:29:23.730
And then the [inaudible]
I think there are

00:29:23.730 --> 00:29:25.340
so many relationships
with the Ligeti.

00:29:25.340 --> 00:29:29.260
So you know one of the things
to think about when you listen

00:29:29.260 --> 00:29:32.190
to the concert is like how
are these pieces interrelated?

00:29:32.190 --> 00:29:33.490
What is a common thread?

00:29:33.490 --> 00:29:34.790
What is not?

00:29:34.790 --> 00:29:36.850
Where do they spread apart?

00:29:36.850 --> 00:29:39.020
I always find that interesting.

00:29:39.020 --> 00:29:41.470
&gt;&gt; Taka Kigawa: So Ligeti
is the key [laughter].

00:29:41.470 --> 00:29:42.770
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Well it
could be one of the keys.

00:29:42.770 --> 00:29:44.420 position:56%
Or Braxton could be one of the keys.

00:29:44.420 --> 00:29:45.720
You know.

00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:47.020
&gt;&gt; Richard Carrick:
If you see a square,

00:29:47.020 --> 00:29:50.250
you switch to Ligeti
really quickly [laughter].

00:29:50.250 --> 00:29:54.090 position:56%
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: But I inadvertently
skipped over the piece Rowe.

00:29:54.090 --> 00:29:56.090
You guys should consider
changing your name

00:29:56.090 --> 00:29:58.950
to Either Rowe for
that one [laughter].

00:29:58.950 --> 00:30:00.330
But only if you play it backwards.

00:30:00.330 --> 00:30:04.080
But maybe you can say a
little bit about this piece.

00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:09.190 position:56%
Because while it is a different sort
of work on the program, it does,

00:30:09.190 --> 00:30:12.440
as you say, have a, when you
just mentioned micropolyphony.

00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:15.200
It has again like kind of this
internal energy that is trying

00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:17.980
to come out of the sound it seems
like as you are listening to it.

00:30:17.980 --> 00:30:21.920
Even though it has this, you
know the title of Serenity

00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:24.700
and the feeling of that in a sense.

00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:27.990
There is this kind of energy
that is bubbling out of it.

00:30:27.990 --> 00:30:29.290
How do you.

00:30:29.290 --> 00:30:30.590
Or maybe you can just
say a few things?

00:30:30.590 --> 00:30:32.390
Did you work with the composer
at all with this piece?

00:30:32.390 --> 00:30:33.690
&gt;&gt; Richard Carrick: We did.

00:30:33.690 --> 00:30:36.850
We had the pleasure of working
with Anna Thorvaldsdottir,

00:30:36.850 --> 00:30:39.730
who is a young Icelandic composer.

00:30:39.730 --> 00:30:42.480
And she is currently very busy.

00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:46.900
She is one of the young composers
with the New York Philharmonic.

00:30:46.900 --> 00:30:51.200
And her music is being
performed widely internationally.

00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:58.830
And we had the pleasure of inviting
her to Miller Theater in 2014

00:30:58.830 --> 00:31:00.860 position:56%
where we did a concert of her music.

00:31:00.860 --> 00:31:02.340
And we premiered some of her pieces

00:31:02.340 --> 00:31:05.850
and we played this piece
and a few other pieces.

00:31:05.850 --> 00:31:07.310
And that was really lovely.

00:31:07.310 --> 00:31:09.210
She is a great person to work with.

00:31:09.210 --> 00:31:12.750
And one of the things about this
piece is you will hear it is,

00:31:12.750 --> 00:31:14.050
it is called Serenity.

00:31:14.050 --> 00:31:17.770
So there is some music in
there that is very serene.

00:31:17.770 --> 00:31:21.530
But then there is, she also gives
you other things to kind of poke

00:31:21.530 --> 00:31:23.890
around in and put that in context.

00:31:23.890 --> 00:31:30.300
So there is this kind of a shadow
of expressivity that happens

00:31:30.300 --> 00:31:32.100
in the music I feel like.

00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:34.410
You know, so she is
creating a stillness,

00:31:34.410 --> 00:31:37.610
but she is also eluding
to something else.

00:31:37.610 --> 00:31:39.940
And then there are these really
interesting things happening

00:31:39.940 --> 00:31:42.290
with the percussion and the piano.

00:31:42.290 --> 00:31:45.570
I will not give it away
because you will see it.

00:31:45.570 --> 00:31:48.970
And in the beautiful hall here,
you will hear it beautifully.

00:31:48.970 --> 00:31:52.560
But it also sets you up for.

00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:54.700
You know it is a piece that you,

00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:57.970 position:56%
you might ask yourself while you are
listening to it, what am I feeling?

00:31:57.970 --> 00:32:00.360
Am I, am I feeling serenity?

00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:02.030
Am I experiencing serenity?

00:32:02.030 --> 00:32:06.300
Is this piece alluding
to an imagine serenity?

00:32:06.300 --> 00:32:10.780 position:56%
Or is this piece just referencing
her state of mind when she wrote it?

00:32:10.780 --> 00:32:13.810
You know these are all interesting
questions when you can listen.

00:32:13.810 --> 00:32:18.390
And this is a piece you can really
kind of have your mind focused

00:32:18.390 --> 00:32:21.850 position:56%
on how the music is speaking to you.

00:32:21.850 --> 00:32:24.180
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: You
know I do not want.

00:32:24.180 --> 00:32:26.770
I hope I am not giving away one of
the things that you are mentioning.

00:32:26.770 --> 00:32:29.690
But I was speaking with
Russell a little bit about the,

00:32:29.690 --> 00:32:34.960
about the percussion and
the poetic use of wood.

00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:38.580
But one of the things
that which you will see.

00:32:38.580 --> 00:32:39.880
Well one of the.

00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:43.660
It is a beautiful away to use it.

00:32:43.660 --> 00:32:49.540
And one of the things that she was
very specific about was the type

00:32:49.540 --> 00:32:51.880
of mallet that he would
be using with each

00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:54.460
of these maybe unusual
instruments as well.

00:32:54.460 --> 00:32:59.790
And so there is this great level
of detail that comes into play.

00:32:59.790 --> 00:33:01.390
But the overall.

00:33:01.390 --> 00:33:04.140
It is like you have this
combination of, of things happening

00:33:04.140 --> 00:33:07.650
at that low level and also
at that broader level.

00:33:07.650 --> 00:33:09.480
And it is like you
say is that you attend

00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:11.260
to different things just
depending on your state

00:33:11.260 --> 00:33:13.550
of mind maybe or something.

00:33:13.550 --> 00:33:17.120
Well before we get to some
questions from the audience,

00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:20.780
maybe you can say a bit about
what you might be up to next?

00:33:20.780 --> 00:33:27.650
Like what is next on the agenda
for the ensemble and individually?

00:33:27.650 --> 00:33:30.340
&gt;&gt; Richard Carrick: Well we are
constantly evolving as a group

00:33:30.340 --> 00:33:37.220
and always looking to do programs
and work with composers and venues

00:33:37.220 --> 00:33:39.410
that kind of put us in
a new place you know.

00:33:39.410 --> 00:33:47.690
So we are working with a
Swedish/Dutch composer in April.

00:33:47.690 --> 00:33:49.970
We will be flying to
Sweden next month.

00:33:49.970 --> 00:33:51.570
A few of us are going.

00:33:51.570 --> 00:33:54.360
And we are premiering
his big piece there

00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:56.680
with another group there
called Ensemble Son.

00:33:56.680 --> 00:34:01.610
And then we are coming
back to New York in April.

00:34:01.610 --> 00:34:04.260
And that is kind of the next thing.

00:34:04.260 --> 00:34:08.740
But you know the group.

00:34:08.740 --> 00:34:12.180
The core of the group
is actually the fact

00:34:12.180 --> 00:34:15.190
that we have these
incredible soloists.

00:34:15.190 --> 00:34:16.500
It is not just chamber music.

00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:19.190
It is chamber music
made with soloists.

00:34:19.190 --> 00:34:22.370
And we are really excited
about that kind of energy.

00:34:22.370 --> 00:34:25.670
So we are all kind of doing
many different projects.

00:34:25.670 --> 00:34:27.980
You have got a concert
here tomorrow, don't you?

00:34:27.980 --> 00:34:29.280
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Choi: Yep.

00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:33.150
But that is a different kind of
situation at the National Gallery.

00:34:33.150 --> 00:34:36.180
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Some of you
may be going already to that.

00:34:36.180 --> 00:34:38.600
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Choi: Oh just
another composer tomorrow.

00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:42.770
Mascal and she wrote a
piece for, that goes along

00:34:42.770 --> 00:34:44.070
with a black and white film.

00:34:44.070 --> 00:34:46.300
And so we are playing live
string quartet with voice.

00:34:46.300 --> 00:34:48.520
It is going to be really
fun I think.

00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:50.390
So we are rehearsing that.

00:34:50.390 --> 00:34:56.040
But we are often times
working on new music,

00:34:56.040 --> 00:34:58.330
different composers, commissions.

00:34:58.330 --> 00:35:00.910
A couple of different groups.

00:35:00.910 --> 00:35:02.930
Some of us are in different
groups as well.

00:35:02.930 --> 00:35:05.200
Have the other violinist,
Paula Garcia

00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:09.250
and John Popham have a
trio called Long Leash.

00:35:09.250 --> 00:35:14.450
And they will play works for piano
trio but by similar composers.

00:35:14.450 --> 00:35:18.740
So it is really nice how we
can bring in our knowledge

00:35:18.740 --> 00:35:21.600
and inspiration from the other
times that we have worked

00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:25.550
with these composers and
come in to Either/Or.

00:35:25.550 --> 00:35:29.000
&gt;&gt; Richard Carrick: I guess I would
say we have a number of recordings.

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:31.370
And we just released
a few recordings.

00:35:31.370 --> 00:35:33.440 position:56%
One with Anthony Coleman, which came

00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:36.480
out eelier this year
on New World Records.

00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:38.420
And Elliott Sharp.

00:35:38.420 --> 00:35:40.880
We are on his latest CD as well.

00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:44.190
My CD came out last year
with a recording of that.

00:35:44.190 --> 00:35:47.870
And so we have been pretty active
and really fortunate to be able

00:35:47.870 --> 00:35:50.850
to put this stuff down
in some sort of.

00:35:50.850 --> 00:35:52.150
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Choi: And one other.

00:35:52.150 --> 00:35:55.810
We worked with Miya
Masaoka, who is the,

00:35:55.810 --> 00:35:58.410
a composer and performer as well.

00:35:58.410 --> 00:36:02.210
And she is married to George Lewis,
who is also part of the AACM.

00:36:02.210 --> 00:36:05.710
And Either/Or is going
to be performing her work

00:36:05.710 --> 00:36:07.830
in March at National Sawdust.

00:36:07.830 --> 00:36:09.430
So that should be pretty exciting.

00:36:09.430 --> 00:36:11.570
That is the new venue in Brooklyn.

00:36:11.570 --> 00:36:12.870
Woo hoo hoo.

00:36:12.870 --> 00:36:14.170
Yeah.

00:36:14.170 --> 00:36:15.470
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Taka,
what about you?

00:36:15.470 --> 00:36:17.780
What is your next, gonna tackle?

00:36:17.780 --> 00:36:20.860
&gt;&gt; Taka Kigawa: Being a pianist,
I have a lot of projects going on.

00:36:20.860 --> 00:36:23.240
And. Oh actually I am
playing Richard's piece

00:36:23.240 --> 00:36:25.760
in April in New York City.

00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:29.740
It is a piece about a
young [inaudible] composers

00:36:29.740 --> 00:36:31.040
and Richard Carrick.

00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:34.690
And also Sean Shepherd
and [inaudible] and one

00:36:34.690 --> 00:36:38.110
or two more solo piano pieces.

00:36:38.110 --> 00:36:39.740 position:56%
That is my next [inaudible] project.

00:36:39.740 --> 00:36:41.410
And I also.

00:36:41.410 --> 00:36:46.890
I am revisiting [inaudible]
big pieces.

00:36:46.890 --> 00:36:48.190
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: The whole thing?

00:36:48.190 --> 00:36:49.490
&gt;&gt; Taka Kigawa: The whole thing.

00:36:49.490 --> 00:36:50.790
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Choi: That
is a Taka thing.

00:36:50.790 --> 00:36:52.730
He does not just do one.

00:36:52.730 --> 00:36:54.210
He does the whole thing.

00:36:54.210 --> 00:36:57.240
&gt;&gt; Taka Kigawa: [Inaudible] and
I am also revisiting [inaudible]

00:36:57.240 --> 00:36:58.540
and also [inaudible].

00:36:58.540 --> 00:37:04.910
So. This whole thing
is jabbling [laughter].

00:37:04.910 --> 00:37:06.210
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Wow.

00:37:06.210 --> 00:37:10.150
Why don't we take a moment now just
to, if anybody has any questions

00:37:10.150 --> 00:37:14.980
for these guys before we let them
go and get ready for the concert?

00:37:14.980 --> 00:37:18.380
Jay has a microphone and
he can bring it to you.

00:37:20.330 --> 00:37:21.730
Surely somebody has a question.

00:37:21.730 --> 00:37:24.030
There we go.

00:37:37.040 --> 00:37:38.720
&gt;&gt; So I cannot wait
to hear the Braxton.

00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:44.610
The way you described
the improvisation

00:37:44.610 --> 00:37:46.500
and the jumping around
and everything.

00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:48.670
Is he unique as a composer
in doing that?

00:37:48.670 --> 00:37:51.510
Or do, have other composers
done that as well?

00:37:51.510 --> 00:37:53.500
&gt;&gt; Richard Carrick:
That is a good question.

00:37:53.500 --> 00:37:54.800
Composers have done that.

00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:56.100
And improvisation.

00:37:56.100 --> 00:38:00.100
You know if you go back
in history, improvisation

00:38:00.100 --> 00:38:03.960
and composition were
almost the same act.

00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:05.700
I mean very often the composer

00:38:05.700 --> 00:38:11.100 position:56%
in Mozart's time improvise a piece
you know based on these formal rules

00:38:11.100 --> 00:38:17.010
and so forth and kind
of deviated from them.

00:38:17.010 --> 00:38:20.950
So improvisation and composition
have always been linked.

00:38:20.950 --> 00:38:26.270
It is true that since the, since
modern times, you know certainly

00:38:26.270 --> 00:38:30.840
in the last hundred years
improvisation has kind

00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:35.430
of been weeded out of
a lot of notated music.

00:38:35.430 --> 00:38:40.670
But Anthony Braxton does it
in a very unique way I think.

00:38:40.670 --> 00:38:44.140
He really wants to setup
this trance you know.

00:38:44.140 --> 00:38:48.720 position:56%
And that is like, that is one of
the great tricks of this piece is --

00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:51.210
how do you both be in a trance
and constantly changing.

00:38:51.210 --> 00:38:53.990
You know, you cannot do both.

00:38:53.990 --> 00:38:55.420
So. So how do you kind
of deal with that?

00:38:55.420 --> 00:39:00.260
As a performer what choices do you
make and when do you make them?

00:39:00.260 --> 00:39:02.170
But there are many
others who do that.

00:39:02.170 --> 00:39:05.180
And as Jennifer said, he is
part of the AACM and many

00:39:05.180 --> 00:39:08.220
of those composers, Muhal
Richard Abrams, George Lewis

00:39:08.220 --> 00:39:17.980
and many others have been dealing
with a lot of these issues.

00:39:17.980 --> 00:39:22.930
And it is not really just
notation improvisation.

00:39:22.930 --> 00:39:26.940
It is actually like how do you
find new ways of making music

00:39:26.940 --> 00:39:29.600
with performers, with
scores and so forth.

00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:31.780 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Choi: Oh the Association
of Advancement Creative Musicians.

00:39:31.780 --> 00:39:33.640
So. And they were based
out of Chicago.

00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:40.620 position:56%
And actually to answer your question
further, I had the opportunity

00:39:40.620 --> 00:39:44.860
to work with four of these
amazing founding musicians.

00:39:44.860 --> 00:39:46.480
So Wadada Leo Smith on the trumpet.

00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:47.780
Leroy Jenkins.

00:39:47.780 --> 00:39:49.080
George Lewis.

00:39:49.080 --> 00:39:50.380
And Anthony Braxton.

00:39:50.380 --> 00:39:51.680 position:56%
And having seen all of their scores,

00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:54.820
it is just so amazing how
unique each one of them.

00:39:54.820 --> 00:39:57.760
They come from the same generation.

00:39:57.760 --> 00:40:00.880
Chicago 1960's.

00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:02.180
This is when they formed.

00:40:02.180 --> 00:40:03.590
And they really wanted to.

00:40:03.590 --> 00:40:07.300 position:56%
They did not want to play just jazz.

00:40:07.300 --> 00:40:12.000
In fact, some of them did not
even have formal jazz training.

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:13.710
Not all of them did.

00:40:13.710 --> 00:40:17.010
So. So it is amazing
that each of them came

00:40:17.010 --> 00:40:21.620 position:56%
up with completely different systems
of doing so, of how to do this sort

00:40:21.620 --> 00:40:25.020
of quasi structured
improve notated pieces.

00:40:25.020 --> 00:40:26.320
Very distinct.

00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:27.620
Very interesting.

00:40:27.620 --> 00:40:30.300
But also calling for the musician
to definitely improvise and go out

00:40:30.300 --> 00:40:31.640
and explore their own world.

00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:33.110
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: One thing I would
mention too, if you are interested,

00:40:33.110 --> 00:40:34.760
that George Lewis actually two
years ago wrote a biography kind

00:40:34.760 --> 00:40:36.060
of the organization.

00:40:36.060 --> 00:40:37.360
It is quite big.

00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:38.660
So you can check that
out [inaudible].

00:40:38.660 --> 00:40:39.960
&gt;&gt; Richard Carrick: It is called
A Power Stronger Than Itself.

00:40:39.960 --> 00:40:41.260 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Choi: It is fascinating.

00:40:41.260 --> 00:40:42.560
Yeah.

00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:44.200
&gt;&gt; Since we are in the Library
and you have so many treasures,

00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:47.890
I was very interested in what
you said about the difference

00:40:47.890 --> 00:40:51.430
between working on the
original manuscripts core,

00:40:51.430 --> 00:40:55.700
manuscript and the final product.

00:40:55.700 --> 00:40:58.370
I am sure all of us are aware

00:40:58.370 --> 00:41:02.880
that the original manuscripts
core is disappearing.

00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:09.640
I know most of the modern
composers do not write, they type.

00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:11.430
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: A lot of them do.

00:41:11.430 --> 00:41:14.980
Some of them still
do it the other way.

00:41:14.980 --> 00:41:18.990
&gt;&gt; Okay. But I think
for future generations

00:41:18.990 --> 00:41:24.330
and here comes the Library,
what is going to happen?

00:41:24.330 --> 00:41:25.770
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: It
is a tough question.

00:41:25.770 --> 00:41:28.240
But I would say that there
are a number of composers

00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:29.540
who do still write by hand.

00:41:29.540 --> 00:41:31.240
So we will just keep
collecting their stuff

00:41:31.240 --> 00:41:32.540
and [laughter] ignore the rest.

00:41:32.540 --> 00:41:34.200
No. I am just kidding.

00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:36.240
No. It is a tricky thing.

00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:40.240
When the Library Commissions any
composer, part of the condition

00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:43.600
of the Commission is that we
receive the original manuscript.

00:41:43.600 --> 00:41:46.240
So in the cases, and
this has been especially

00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:48.470
in the last 10 years this
has been more the case,

00:41:48.470 --> 00:41:50.980
that they have electronically
produced scores.

00:41:50.980 --> 00:41:53.590
So we try to get a
unique version of it.

00:41:53.590 --> 00:41:55.940
And the way that we handle
it is we ask for something

00:41:55.940 --> 00:41:59.490
that is before it has been
submitted to the publisher

00:41:59.490 --> 00:42:02.080
for kind of the final revisions.

00:42:02.080 --> 00:42:05.170
And sometimes composers will
give us little extra bits.

00:42:05.170 --> 00:42:09.560
They will give us further revisions
they might make after the fact.

00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:12.410
They initial each page so it, you
know there is something about it

00:42:12.410 --> 00:42:17.140
that is unique and still of use
to researchers who may have access

00:42:17.140 --> 00:42:19.830
to the published score, but
there might be something

00:42:19.830 --> 00:42:21.340
to be found in the other one.

00:42:21.340 --> 00:42:24.800 position:56%
But it is definitely an issue and
actually one of the bigger issues is

00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:28.850
for composers who have an
electroacoustic component

00:42:28.850 --> 00:42:30.150
to their work.

00:42:30.150 --> 00:42:33.860
And how does one preserve, you
know, particular technology

00:42:33.860 --> 00:42:36.900
that might be common right
now, but 20 years from now,

00:42:36.900 --> 00:42:38.950
50 years from now, it
is not going to be.

00:42:38.950 --> 00:42:45.850
So that is a challenge that
is a work in progress I think.

00:42:45.850 --> 00:42:48.040
&gt;&gt; Thank you and good luck.

00:42:48.040 --> 00:42:49.340
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: I
think there is one.

00:42:49.340 --> 00:42:53.260
I thought I saw somebody.

00:42:56.300 --> 00:42:58.600
Oh there is one other.

00:43:02.720 --> 00:43:05.170 position:56%
&gt;&gt; First I just want to thank David.

00:43:05.170 --> 00:43:08.520
You spoil us with your
program notes.

00:43:08.520 --> 00:43:11.830 position:56%
He is a very excellent musicologist.

00:43:11.830 --> 00:43:15.870
But he also gets inside
a score very well.

00:43:15.870 --> 00:43:19.130
So thank you, David [applause].

00:43:20.480 --> 00:43:25.660
And I just want to ask you
as performers of the Braxton

00:43:25.660 --> 00:43:31.380
and the other pieces that have
this improvisatory element,

00:43:31.380 --> 00:43:37.510
don't you think it is about
trying to keep it alive

00:43:37.510 --> 00:43:42.600
that every performance the compeer
is wanting it to be very organic.

00:43:42.600 --> 00:43:48.580
And this dialogue between
audience members and performers

00:43:48.580 --> 00:43:52.180
and the composer is
all wrapped into it?

00:43:52.180 --> 00:43:53.480
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Choi: Yeah.

00:43:53.480 --> 00:43:54.780
Absolutely.

00:43:54.780 --> 00:43:59.080
There is another book I was just
reading, just the other day.

00:43:59.080 --> 00:44:01.160 position:56%
The. It is called Free Improvisation

00:44:01.160 --> 00:44:04.280
by Derek Bailey, who
is just phenomenal.

00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:07.710
I am so lucky that I had
a chance to play with him

00:44:07.710 --> 00:44:10.910
in New York City before
he passed away.

00:44:10.910 --> 00:44:13.130
But he mentions that.

00:44:13.130 --> 00:44:16.730
Like in improve you want to
have the audience interact.

00:44:16.730 --> 00:44:20.040
You want to feel the
moment right there.

00:44:20.040 --> 00:44:22.270
So we cannot really predict.

00:44:22.270 --> 00:44:23.570
That is why.

00:44:23.570 --> 00:44:24.870
We started practicing today

00:44:24.870 --> 00:44:26.580
and I said you know what
let's just see what happens.

00:44:26.580 --> 00:44:28.660
Because you need that interaction.

00:44:28.660 --> 00:44:33.670
It is actually very crucial to
know what is going to play out.

00:44:33.670 --> 00:44:36.080
And we could feel it you know.

00:44:36.080 --> 00:44:40.660
But actually there is a,
there is one really good point

00:44:40.660 --> 00:44:42.950
that Derek Bailey mentions
in this book

00:44:42.950 --> 00:44:46.430
and says sometimes
you do not want to go

00:44:46.430 --> 00:44:49.330
with what the audience
necessarily wants

00:44:49.330 --> 00:44:52.260
because that might not be
the right move for the music.

00:44:52.260 --> 00:44:54.490
So there is this little
interplay and you kind of have

00:44:54.490 --> 00:44:57.300
to feel what is right
and wrong at the moment.

00:44:57.300 --> 00:44:59.830
&gt;&gt; Richard Carrick: Yeah it
seemed like Derek Bailey.

00:44:59.830 --> 00:45:01.860
In reading that book,
I got the sense

00:45:01.860 --> 00:45:05.410
that on one hand he was keenly
aware of everything around him.

00:45:05.410 --> 00:45:09.050
And on the other hand, he
had his own internal score

00:45:09.050 --> 00:45:10.910
that he was kind of creating.

00:45:10.910 --> 00:45:13.280
And that was, and that
was the tension

00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:15.500
that created all the
incredible, you know.

00:45:15.500 --> 00:45:19.740
If you ever hear him play,
I mean you were not sure

00:45:19.740 --> 00:45:21.260
if he was listening
to the other person

00:45:21.260 --> 00:45:23.010 position:56%
because he was doing his own things.

00:45:23.010 --> 00:45:25.370
Then you realize he was listening
to everything they were doing,

00:45:25.370 --> 00:45:27.890
but he was not trying to
imitate the other person.

00:45:27.890 --> 00:45:30.210
He was trying to create a richness

00:45:30.210 --> 00:45:34.770
from being unique inside
that context.

00:45:34.770 --> 00:45:37.190
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Good answers.

00:45:37.190 --> 00:45:39.990
Well I think we should
probably let our musicians go

and get ready for the concert.

00:45:41.290 --> 00:45:42.890

00:45:42.890 --> 00:45:44.960
