MARISSA GIUSTINA: Hello.

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:10.300
I'm Marissa Giustina,
and I'd like

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.220
to introduce you to a
new series of videos

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:14.800
about quantum computers
and how to program them.

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.720
We have a series of
four videos covering

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.940
a broad set of concepts
we think you'll enjoy.

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:21.220
I'll explain what quantum
computing actually is.

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:23.660
It's rather different from
traditional computing,

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:26.170
and there are lots of narratives
out there describing it.

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:28.210
I'll boil it down
to the essentials,

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.510
show you how quantum computers
work and how they can be used.

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:33.220
Daniel will dig
into the differences

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:35.440
between classical and
quantum information

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:36.700
on a physical level.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.260
You'll learn about
traditional memory

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.420
and how it works on a
micro electronic level,

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.450
then build on this to see
how a quantum chip works.

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:46.090
Next will come the programming
of a quantum computer,

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:48.070
and Dave will tell
you all about it,

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.020
not just the concepts and
programming a quantum computer

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.410
but also the new and
open-source Cirq language that

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:54.310
makes it easy.

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:56.980
Then finally, if you're
interested in the deep concepts

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.617
of computer science,
Sergio has a treat for you.

00:00:59.617 --> 00:01:01.450
He'll talk about the
long-established strong

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:04.300
Church-Turing thesis and how
quantum computing provides

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.220
an exciting breakthrough
from the limitations

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:07.379
of traditional computing.

00:01:07.379 --> 00:01:08.920
This is the first
set of videos we're

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.900
producing for Google
Developers, and we'd

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.580
love to hear your
feedback on them.

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.820
If you have any questions for me
or any of the other presenters,

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.750
