the hell is going on there it makes me
 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.640 align:start position:0%
the hell is going on there it makes me
think<00:01:09.990><c> of</c><00:01:10.020><c> a</c><00:01:10.110><c> spirograph</c><00:01:10.530><c> yeah</c><00:01:11.450><c> I</c><00:01:12.650><c> almost</c>

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 align:start position:0%
think of a spirograph yeah I almost
 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.740 align:start position:0%
think of a spirograph yeah I almost
wanted<00:01:14.040><c> to</c><00:01:14.130><c> see</c><00:01:14.280><c> that</c><00:01:14.460><c> scene</c><00:01:14.939><c> again</c><00:01:15.210><c> just</c><00:01:15.600><c> a</c>

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 align:start position:0%
wanted to see that scene again just a
 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.840 align:start position:0%
wanted to see that scene again just a
white<00:01:15.960><c> kept</c><00:01:16.470><c> EMA</c><00:01:16.860><c> she</c><00:01:16.920><c> was</c><00:01:17.130><c> so</c><00:01:17.280><c> cool</c><00:01:17.549><c> there</c>

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 align:start position:0%
white kept EMA she was so cool there
 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.550 align:start position:0%
white kept EMA she was so cool there
it's<00:01:18.000><c> just</c><00:01:18.150><c> the</c><00:01:18.210><c> way</c><00:01:18.330><c> more</c><00:01:18.869><c> than</c><00:01:19.049><c> any</c><00:01:19.290><c> way</c><00:01:19.409><c> uh</c>

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 align:start position:0%
it's just the way more than any way uh
 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.359 align:start position:0%
it's just the way more than any way uh
so<00:01:21.530><c> eventually</c><00:01:22.530><c> it</c><00:01:22.920><c> turns</c><00:01:23.100><c> out</c><00:01:23.250><c> what's</c>

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 align:start position:0%
so eventually it turns out what's
 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:24.950 align:start position:0%
so eventually it turns out what's
happening<00:01:23.610><c> takes</c><00:01:23.820><c> dad</c><00:01:24.090><c> is</c><00:01:24.299><c> a</c><00:01:24.420><c> he's</c><00:01:24.570><c> actually</c>

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 align:start position:0%
happening takes dad is a he's actually
 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.450 align:start position:0%
happening takes dad is a he's actually
given<00:01:25.259><c> birth</c><00:01:25.470><c> to</c><00:01:26.900><c> Jake</c><00:01:27.900><c> and</c><00:01:28.200><c> then</c><00:01:29.100><c> the</c><00:01:29.280><c> mother</c>

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 align:start position:0%
given birth to Jake and then the mother
 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.710 align:start position:0%
given birth to Jake and then the mother
gives<00:01:29.820><c> birth</c><00:01:29.909><c> to</c><00:01:30.060><c> the</c><00:01:30.390><c> brother</c>

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 align:start position:0%
gives birth to the brother
 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.020 align:start position:0%
gives birth to the brother
and<00:01:30.900><c> that's</c><00:01:31.740><c> why</c><00:01:32.070><c> Jake</c><00:01:32.430><c> can't</c><00:01:32.610><c> turn</c><00:01:32.700><c> anything</c>

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 align:start position:0%
and that's why Jake can't turn anything
 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.850 align:start position:0%
and that's why Jake can't turn anything
cuz<00:01:33.390><c> he's</c><00:01:33.600><c> actually</c><00:01:33.840><c> the</c><00:01:34.170><c> product</c><00:01:34.470><c> of</c><00:01:34.650><c> one</c><00:01:34.799><c> of</c>

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 align:start position:0%
cuz he's actually the product of one of
 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.020 align:start position:0%
cuz he's actually the product of one of
those<00:01:34.950><c> things</c><00:01:35.159><c> that</c><00:01:35.250><c> can</c><00:01:35.579><c> turn</c><00:01:35.820><c> it</c><00:01:35.939><c> to</c>

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 align:start position:0%
those things that can turn it to
 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.370 align:start position:0%
those things that can turn it to
anything<00:01:36.299><c> I</c><00:01:36.689><c> think</c><00:01:37.110><c> there</c><00:01:37.290><c> was</c><00:01:37.380><c> only</c><00:01:37.619><c> one</c>

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 align:start position:0%
anything I think there was only one
 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.840 align:start position:0%
anything I think there was only one
that's<00:01:40.380><c> my</c><00:01:40.710><c> guess</c><00:01:40.979><c> I</c><00:01:41.220><c> think</c><00:01:41.280><c> there</c><00:01:41.520><c> was</c><00:01:41.640><c> just</c>

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 align:start position:0%
that's my guess I think there was just
 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.560 align:start position:0%
that's my guess I think there was just
only<00:01:42.030><c> actually</c><00:01:42.600><c> one</c><00:01:42.990><c> well</c><00:01:43.799><c> one</c><00:01:44.430><c> it</c><00:01:45.090><c> just</c><00:01:45.420><c> kept</c>

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 align:start position:0%
only actually one well one it just kept
 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.389 align:start position:0%
only actually one well one it just kept
changing<00:01:45.720><c> another</c><00:01:46.110><c> stuff</c><00:01:46.439><c> he</c><00:01:47.070><c> that's</c><00:01:47.250><c> be</c>

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 align:start position:0%
changing another stuff he that's be
 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.760 align:start position:0%
changing another stuff he that's be
really<00:01:48.060><c> fast</c><00:01:48.420><c> but</c><00:01:48.780><c> again</c><00:01:49.049><c> we</c><00:01:49.229><c> saw</c><00:01:49.409><c> he</c><00:01:49.530><c> could</c>

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 align:start position:0%
really fast but again we saw he could
 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.100 align:start position:0%
really fast but again we saw he could
teleport<00:01:50.310><c> to</c><00:01:50.670><c> different</c><00:01:50.970><c> places</c><00:01:51.180><c> you</c><00:01:51.630><c> know</c><00:01:51.780><c> he</c>

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 align:start position:0%
teleport to different places you know he
 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.710 align:start position:0%
teleport to different places you know he
actually<00:01:52.470><c> he's</c><00:01:52.829><c> separated</c><00:01:53.520><c> into</c><00:01:53.729><c> two</c><00:01:54.119><c> yeah</c>

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 align:start position:0%
actually he's separated into two yeah
 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.840 align:start position:0%
actually he's separated into two yeah
that's<00:01:55.170><c> two</c><00:01:55.350><c> so</c><00:01:55.979><c> that</c><00:01:56.189><c> very</c><00:01:56.399><c> well</c><00:01:56.490><c> could</c><00:01:56.579><c> be</c>

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 align:start position:0%
that's two so that very well could be
 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.459 align:start position:0%
that's two so that very well could be
just<00:01:57.149><c> one</c><00:01:57.500><c> lung</c><00:01:58.500><c> creature</c><00:01:58.770><c> and</c><00:01:59.600><c> if</c><00:02:00.600><c> it</c><00:02:00.899><c> is</c><00:02:01.110><c> one</c>

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 align:start position:0%

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:27.460 align:start position:0%
was one of those things where it's like
 

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:30.570 align:start position:0%
was one of those things where it's like
okay<00:06:27.790><c> there</c><00:06:28.330><c> has</c><00:06:28.540><c> to</c><00:06:28.570><c> be</c><00:06:28.780><c> a</c><00:06:28.900><c> second</c><00:06:29.350><c> one</c><00:06:29.500><c> and</c><00:06:30.370><c> it</c>

okay there has to be a second one and it
 

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:31.620 align:start position:0%
okay there has to be a second one and it
just<00:06:30.610><c> makes</c><00:06:30.910><c> sense</c><00:06:31.090><c> what</c><00:06:31.300><c> this</c><00:06:31.420><c> thing's</c>

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:31.630 align:start position:0%
just makes sense what this thing's
 

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:32.909 align:start position:0%
just makes sense what this thing's
