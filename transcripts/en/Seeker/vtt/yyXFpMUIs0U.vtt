00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.460
Cake or death is
an obvious choice.

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:03.160
Cake.

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:07.240
But being frozen in unproven
cryonic technology or death?

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:08.774
Eh.

00:00:08.774 --> 00:00:14.375
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:14.375 --> 00:00:16.350
Hey all, Trace here for D News.

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.160
Kim Suozzi has joined the
ranks of cryonic pioneers,

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.960
and become one of the
few hundred people frozen

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.380
in suspension, only to be
thawed out in the far future.

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.455
Kim found out she had
terminal brain cancer when

00:00:30.455 --> 00:00:31.670
she was in her early '20s.

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:35.000
And on her 23rd birthday,
she posted on Reddit, what

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.270
should she do with the last
few months of her life?

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:39.340
And the Redditors had
thousands of comments,

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.730
from try LSD to run up huge
debt on your credit card.

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.094
But there were comments also
about cryonic preservation.

00:00:47.094 --> 00:00:48.510
Her interest was
piqued, and soon,

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.718
with the help of some small
donations from Redditors,

00:00:50.718 --> 00:00:52.980
and some big donations
from some nonprofits,

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.140
she had enough money
to cryonically preserve

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.130
her entire body.

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:59.902
Science fiction has long talked
about hyper sleep or stasis

00:00:59.902 --> 00:01:02.610
or cryo-sleep or
whatever it's called,

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:04.690
and that technology
does exist today.

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:07.410
But it's less than perfect.

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:11.650
The scientific term for this is
not cryogenics, but cryonics.

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:14.900
Cryogenics is studying anything
that's kept really cold.

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.110
But if you put something
living into suspension,

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:19.890
that's cryonics.

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.770
As of last weekend, Kim
finally succumbed to her cancer

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.030
and was de-animated.

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.510
That's what the
cryonic people call it.

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:28.730
And then, she was put
into preservation.

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:29.610
Here's how it works.

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.770
First, you're de-animated.

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.650
And then, your body
is cooled rapidly so

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.760
that you get to a
very cold temperature

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.540
without damaging too many of
the tissues if you can help it.

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.930
Then you're put into
liquid nitrogen,

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.722
and you're left there
for a long time.

00:01:45.722 --> 00:01:47.180
People put themselves
in suspension

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.680
for a variety of reasons,
anything from fear of death,

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.210
love of life, hope for a cure
for their disease, curiosity

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.420
about the future, or even
wanting to be immortal.

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.760
The thing is, we've got no
way to re-animate people that

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.230
have been de-animated.

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:06.420
The problem with the
technology at the moment

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.430
is that our cells
are full of water,

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:13.510
and when you freeze water, it
expands and creates crystals,

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.650
and that bursts
the cell membrane.

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.809
So once we would be thawed out,
we kind of just turn into mush.

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:22.100
That doesn't really stop
people from trying it, though.

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.320
Their rebuttal is
that in the future--

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.989
the far future, whenever
that would be-- they'll

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:27.780
know how to fix it.

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.410
We'll see who's right, I guess.

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:31.660
I mean, we won't
see who's right.

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.550
They'll see who's right.

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:35.690
There is a separate process
called vitrification.

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.840
That's when you replace the
liquid inside of your cells

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.720
with this chemical cocktail
that doesn't freeze and burst

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:43.920
the membranes.

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.450
It's been proven to work
on a variety of small bits,

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.030
like cells and organs
that are really

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.760
small, but not a whole anything.

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.490
Cryonics have been
around for a while.

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:56.150
The first institute
started in the 1960s

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:57.890
in my home state of Michigan.

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:59.005
You're welcome, science.

00:02:59.005 --> 00:03:00.880
Since then, only a few
others have popped up,

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.960
but they're mostly vilified
for being frauds and shysters

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.200
because the technology
is unproven,

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.582
and no one has seen anybody
successfully re-animated.

00:03:08.582 --> 00:03:10.040
Because of that,
most of the people

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.280
that work in these
nonprofit organizations

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.520
are do-it-yourselfers,
part-timers,

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:15.990
or are just volunteers.

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:17.860
So when you think of
cryonics, you probably

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.340
think of slick,
see-through canisters

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.290
with people floating,
suspended in bubbly fluid.

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:25.370
But it's not like that at all.

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.270
In fact, it's more like this--
homemade gizmos and freezers

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:29.130
in basements.

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:30.720
Don't feel bad for Kim Suozzi.

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:31.920
She did have her doubts.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.057
But she said that you have
to have faith in technology.

00:03:35.057 --> 00:03:36.640
Would you cryonically
freeze yourself?

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.249
I now it's winter
and it's probably

00:03:38.249 --> 00:03:40.290
already cold enough outside,
and you don't really

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:41.248
want to think about it.

00:03:41.248 --> 00:03:45.384
But let us know why or
why not down the comments.

00:03:45.384 --> 00:03:46.050
It's easy to do.

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:47.797
Also, subscribe to D News.

00:03:47.797 --> 00:03:49.130
Don't give us the cold shoulder.

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.780
It's really easy.

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:52.010
Just click that little button up
there, and you won't regret it.

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:52.650
We promise.

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:53.980
Thanks for watching everybody.

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.930
Seven days of videos,
two videos a day.

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:58.970
See you next time.
