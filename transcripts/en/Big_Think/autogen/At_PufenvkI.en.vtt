so is there a way to define science and

00:00:08.879 --> 00:00:08.889
so is there a way to define science and
 

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:11.180
so is there a way to define science and
separate it from other things

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190
separate it from other things
 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.619

philosophers for a very long time have

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:13.629
philosophers for a very long time have
 

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:15.569
philosophers for a very long time have
been quite dubious about this

00:00:15.569 --> 00:00:15.579
been quite dubious about this
 

00:00:15.579 --> 00:00:18.410
been quite dubious about this
possibility and I think that's right

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420
possibility and I think that's right
 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.140
possibility and I think that's right
right to be dubious there are all sorts

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:22.150
right to be dubious there are all sorts
 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:24.109
right to be dubious there are all sorts
of things that go under the name of

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119
of things that go under the name of
 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.519
of things that go under the name of
science there are the Natural Sciences

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:26.529
science there are the Natural Sciences
 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:28.349
science there are the Natural Sciences
there are the Social Sciences there are

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:28.359
there are the Social Sciences there are
 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:31.230
there are the Social Sciences there are
also various Applied Sciences it's not

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:31.240
also various Applied Sciences it's not
 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.590
also various Applied Sciences it's not
really very are easy to find anything

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:34.600
really very are easy to find anything
 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.870
really very are easy to find anything
that all of those things have in common

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:36.880
that all of those things have in common
 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.870
that all of those things have in common
with one another that isn't relatively

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:39.880
with one another that isn't relatively
 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.230
with one another that isn't relatively
banal and also common to many of our

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:43.240
banal and also common to many of our
 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.440
banal and also common to many of our
everyday activities so we start off

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:46.450
everyday activities so we start off
 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:48.060
everyday activities so we start off
thinking about of course things like

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:48.070
thinking about of course things like
 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:50.430
thinking about of course things like
physics and chemistry and biology and

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:50.440
physics and chemistry and biology and
 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.920
physics and chemistry and biology and
earth science and so forth but then

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:52.930
earth science and so forth but then
 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:54.810
earth science and so forth but then
there are also the social sciences the

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:54.820
there are also the social sciences the
 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:56.880
there are also the social sciences the
human sciences various branches of

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:56.890
human sciences various branches of
 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.870
human sciences various branches of
psychology economics and so forth but

00:00:59.870 --> 00:00:59.880
psychology economics and so forth but
 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.900
psychology economics and so forth but
it's easy to forget that there are also

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910
it's easy to forget that there are also
 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.789
it's easy to forget that there are also
sciences that do rather specific things

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:05.799
sciences that do rather specific things
 

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:10.099
sciences that do rather specific things
like the kinds of scientific

00:01:10.099 --> 00:01:10.109
like the kinds of scientific
 

00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:12.300
like the kinds of scientific
investigations people undertake when

a particular document from the past is a
 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.669
a particular document from the past is a
new manuscript by a famous author so

00:01:29.669 --> 00:01:29.679
new manuscript by a famous author so
 

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:31.859
new manuscript by a famous author so
there are lots and lots of scientific

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:31.869
there are lots and lots of scientific
 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:34.760
there are lots and lots of scientific
studies and they shade over into

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770
studies and they shade over into
 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.580
studies and they shade over into
relatively arm familiar things like

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590
relatively arm familiar things like
 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.239
relatively arm familiar things like
detective work and those shade over into

00:01:42.239 --> 00:01:42.249
detective work and those shade over into
 

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:44.309
detective work and those shade over into
the kinds of things that we do when

00:01:44.309 --> 00:01:44.319
the kinds of things that we do when
 

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:47.940
the kinds of things that we do when
we're trying to solve quite practical

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950
we're trying to solve quite practical
 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:49.739
we're trying to solve quite practical
problems in our own lives when we're

with the plumbing or where we've left

00:01:53.309 --> 00:01:53.319
with the plumbing or where we've left
 

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:56.129
with the plumbing or where we've left
something so it's very very hard I think

00:01:56.129 --> 00:01:56.139
something so it's very very hard I think
 

00:01:56.139 --> 00:01:57.620
something so it's very very hard I think
to say that there's something

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630
to say that there's something
 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.510
to say that there's something
distinctive about science that doesn't

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520
distinctive about science that doesn't
 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.389
distinctive about science that doesn't
also apply to lots and lots and lots of

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:03.399
also apply to lots and lots and lots of
 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:06.270
also apply to lots and lots and lots of
other activities there are certainly

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280
other activities there are certainly
 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.540
other activities there are certainly
some ways of criticizing scientific

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550
some ways of criticizing scientific
 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:12.840
some ways of criticizing scientific
practice some which I've made myself

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850
practice some which I've made myself
 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.390
practice some which I've made myself
but I want to begin with some very

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400
but I want to begin with some very
 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.430
but I want to begin with some very
familiar ones I mean some people will

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440
familiar ones I mean some people will
 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.640
familiar ones I mean some people will
say that the are the science that was

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650
say that the are the science that was
 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.770
say that the are the science that was
produced throughout much of the history

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780
produced throughout much of the history
 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.470
produced throughout much of the history
of science was distorted because it was

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480
of science was distorted because it was
 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.390
of science was distorted because it was
produced by a certain class of people

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400
produced by a certain class of people
 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.720

the Royal Society famous one famously

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730
the Royal Society famous one famously
 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.780
the Royal Society famous one famously
wanted its members to be gentlemen free

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790
wanted its members to be gentlemen free
 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.510
wanted its members to be gentlemen free
and unconfined they didn't like having

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:37.520
and unconfined they didn't like having
 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.850
and unconfined they didn't like having
trades people in because they might have

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860
trades people in because they might have
 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.730
trades people in because they might have
a pecuniary interest that would lead

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:42.740
a pecuniary interest that would lead
 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:45.550
a pecuniary interest that would lead
them not to respect the truth and they

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560
them not to respect the truth and they
 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.230
them not to respect the truth and they
didn't let women in until after the

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:47.240
didn't let women in until after the
 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:51.360
didn't let women in until after the
second world war and actually letting

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370
second world war and actually letting
 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.330
second world war and actually letting
women scientists in makes a big

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340
women scientists in makes a big
 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.310
women scientists in makes a big
difference and has made a big difference

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:57.320
difference and has made a big difference
 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:01.170
difference and has made a big difference
to certain areas of science the study of

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180
to certain areas of science the study of
 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.070
to certain areas of science the study of
our primate relatives for example was

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080
our primate relatives for example was
 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.070
our primate relatives for example was
enormously transformed are really in the

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:09.080
enormously transformed are really in the
 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.060
enormously transformed are really in the
sixties and seventies as a bunch of

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:12.070
sixties and seventies as a bunch of
 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:16.630
sixties and seventies as a bunch of
women primatologists really started to

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640
women primatologists really started to
 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.600
women primatologists really started to
do very serious research and changed our

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:19.610
do very serious research and changed our
 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:21.520
do very serious research and changed our
views about all sorts of things I mean

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530
views about all sorts of things I mean
 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.190
views about all sorts of things I mean
there was this old view of that you know

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200
there was this old view of that you know
 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.840
there was this old view of that you know
there were these dominant males and all

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:25.850
there were these dominant males and all
 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:28.210
there were these dominant males and all
the action was about how the dominant

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220
the action was about how the dominant
 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:29.950
the action was about how the dominant
males got to be dominant and how they

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:29.960
males got to be dominant and how they
 

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:31.570
males got to be dominant and how they
treated other males and all the rest of

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:31.580
treated other males and all the rest of
 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:35.080
treated other males and all the rest of
it and after women began to look very

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090
it and after women began to look very
 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:38.190
it and after women began to look very
very carefully at other features of

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200
very carefully at other features of
 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.200
very carefully at other features of
primate societies they discovered that

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:41.210
primate societies they discovered that
 

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:43.720
primate societies they discovered that
all sorts of things were going on

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730
all sorts of things were going on
 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:48.870
all sorts of things were going on
because of the females influencing the

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:48.880
because of the females influencing the
 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.870
because of the females influencing the
the mating patterns and the females

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:52.880
the mating patterns and the females
 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:55.300
the mating patterns and the females
would make friends with males that they

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.310
would make friends with males that they
 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:58.240
would make friends with males that they
thought would be you know helpful and

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250
thought would be you know helpful and
 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.910
thought would be you know helpful and
supportive and this whole view of the

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:00.920
supportive and this whole view of the
 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:02.980
supportive and this whole view of the
sort of the hyper aggressive primate

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:02.990
sort of the hyper aggressive primate
 

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:06.280
sort of the hyper aggressive primate
beating his chest right was completely

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.290
beating his chest right was completely
 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:09.130
beating his chest right was completely
deflated in favor of all kinds of subtle

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:09.140
deflated in favor of all kinds of subtle
 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:12.000
deflated in favor of all kinds of subtle
strategies pursued by both sexes and

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010
strategies pursued by both sexes and
 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.830
strategies pursued by both sexes and
that was a complete transformation in

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:14.840
that was a complete transformation in
 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:16.530
that was a complete transformation in
our understanding of primate behavior

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:16.540
our understanding of primate behavior
 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:19.300
our understanding of primate behavior
it's a wonderful thing to look back and

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.310
it's a wonderful thing to look back and
 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:22.390
it's a wonderful thing to look back and
and see what a difference people like

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400
and see what a difference people like
 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.540
and see what a difference people like

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:29.869
Jane Goodall Dian Fossey Shirley Strom

and others have made so there's a very
 

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:32.719
and others have made so there's a very
very clear case now there are other

00:04:32.719 --> 00:04:32.729
very clear case now there are other
 

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:35.270
very clear case now there are other
kinds of critique that are sometimes

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280
kinds of critique that are sometimes
 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:36.980
kinds of critique that are sometimes
launched I mean people will sometimes

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990
launched I mean people will sometimes
 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.529
launched I mean people will sometimes
say look there are all of these

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:39.539
say look there are all of these
 

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:42.260
say look there are all of these
extremely successful non-western

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270
extremely successful non-western
 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:45.140
extremely successful non-western
practices that get dismissed by Western

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150
practices that get dismissed by Western
 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:48.409
practices that get dismissed by Western
science anthropologists will sometimes

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:48.419
science anthropologists will sometimes
 

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:50.480
science anthropologists will sometimes
say look how successful this group is

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:50.490
say look how successful this group is
 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:52.700
say look how successful this group is
and his belief system seems to be

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710
and his belief system seems to be
 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:56.869
and his belief system seems to be
utterly weird and yet they do very

00:04:56.869 --> 00:04:56.879
utterly weird and yet they do very
 

00:04:56.879 --> 00:04:58.670
utterly weird and yet they do very
successfully and indeed Western

00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:58.680
successfully and indeed Western
 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.790
successfully and indeed Western
scientists sometimes can't replicate

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:00.800
scientists sometimes can't replicate
 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.119
scientists sometimes can't replicate
those efforts and I think those kinds of

00:05:05.119 --> 00:05:05.129
those efforts and I think those kinds of
 

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:07.969
those efforts and I think those kinds of
critiques need to be taken seriously the

00:05:07.969 --> 00:05:07.979
critiques need to be taken seriously the
 

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:10.520
critiques need to be taken seriously the
one that I think is the most striking is

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:10.530
one that I think is the most striking is
 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:14.779
one that I think is the most striking is
the the water temples of Bali this is a

00:05:14.779 --> 00:05:14.789
the the water temples of Bali this is a
 

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:17.869
the the water temples of Bali this is a
very famous example in which Western

00:05:17.869 --> 00:05:17.879
very famous example in which Western
 

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:20.510
very famous example in which Western
scientists tried very very hard to

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:20.520
scientists tried very very hard to
 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:25.999
scientists tried very very hard to
replicate the armed the strategies that

00:05:25.999 --> 00:05:26.009
replicate the armed the strategies that
 

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:30.230
replicate the armed the strategies that
the Balinese had for assigning water to

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.240
the Balinese had for assigning water to
 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.689
the Balinese had for assigning water to
the fields and the terraces where it was

00:05:32.689 --> 00:05:32.699
the fields and the terraces where it was
 

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:38.570
the fields and the terraces where it was
needed now the best Western scientific

needed now the best Western scientific
 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:41.839
needed now the best Western scientific
efforts failed to do as well as the

00:05:41.839 --> 00:05:41.849
efforts failed to do as well as the
 

00:05:41.849 --> 00:05:44.330
efforts failed to do as well as the
Balinese system which was dependent on a

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:44.340
Balinese system which was dependent on a
 

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:47.059
Balinese system which was dependent on a
system of water temples at which people

00:05:47.059 --> 00:05:47.069
system of water temples at which people
 

00:05:47.069 --> 00:05:51.260
system of water temples at which people
would go and engage in rites to the

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:51.270
would go and engage in rites to the
 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:54.050
would go and engage in rites to the
various gods now on the face of it that

result these guys are pursuing a
 

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:04.219
result these guys are pursuing a
religious agricultural policy and

00:06:04.219 --> 00:06:04.229
religious agricultural policy and
 

00:06:04.229 --> 00:06:06.019
religious agricultural policy and
they're doing better than these

00:06:06.019 --> 00:06:06.029
they're doing better than these
 

00:06:06.029 --> 00:06:08.839
they're doing better than these
extremely sophisticated Western

00:06:08.839 --> 00:06:08.849
extremely sophisticated Western

extremely sophisticated Western
scientists and engineers but when you

00:06:11.059 --> 00:06:11.069
scientists and engineers but when you
 

00:06:11.069 --> 00:06:12.680
scientists and engineers but when you
actually look more closely you can see

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:12.690
actually look more closely you can see
 

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:15.320
actually look more closely you can see
what's going on what the problems that

what's going on what the problems that
 

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:17.959
what's going on what the problems that
are that the two sides are produced are

are that the two sides are produced are

pursuing and solving are actually rather
 

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:22.760
pursuing and solving are actually rather
different and what the Western

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:22.770
different and what the Western
 

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:24.800
different and what the Western
scientists wanted to do was to set up a

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:24.810
scientists wanted to do was to set up a
 

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:27.920
scientists wanted to do was to set up a
foolproof system that would operate in

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:27.930
foolproof system that would operate in
 

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:30.320
foolproof system that would operate in
the absence of any kind of social

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:30.330
the absence of any kind of social
 

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:32.600
the absence of any kind of social
interaction to send the water where it

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:32.610
interaction to send the water where it
 

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:34.730
interaction to send the water where it
was needed when it was needed and they

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:34.740
was needed when it was needed and they
 

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:37.719
was needed when it was needed and they
failed in that what the Bali needs do is

00:06:37.719 --> 00:06:37.729
failed in that what the Bali needs do is
 

00:06:37.729 --> 00:06:40.260
failed in that what the Bali needs do is
congregate periodically at the

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:40.270
congregate periodically at the
 

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:42.930
congregate periodically at the
areas temples and talk to another and of

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:42.940
areas temples and talk to another and of
 

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:44.790
areas temples and talk to another and of
course the talking to one another is

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:44.800
course the talking to one another is
 

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:46.350
course the talking to one another is
really what's doing the trick

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:46.360
really what's doing the trick
 

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:50.820
really what's doing the trick
not the God's blessing on the on the

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:50.830
not the God's blessing on the on the
 

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:53.460
not the God's blessing on the on the
watercourse is they they change the ways

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:53.470
watercourse is they they change the ways
 

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:55.550
watercourse is they they change the ways
in which the water is distributed

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:55.560
in which the water is distributed
 

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:58.740
in which the water is distributed
according to the needs and the needs are

00:06:58.740 --> 00:06:58.750
according to the needs and the needs are
 

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:01.230
according to the needs and the needs are
expressed in social interaction so what

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:01.240
expressed in social interaction so what
 

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:03.900
expressed in social interaction so what
you have here is a two different kinds

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:03.910
you have here is a two different kinds
 

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:06.810
you have here is a two different kinds
of systems and the problem at the end of

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:06.820
of systems and the problem at the end of
 

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:10.350
of systems and the problem at the end of
the day is that the scientists were

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:10.360
the day is that the scientists were
 

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:11.670
the day is that the scientists were
trying to do something much more

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:11.680
trying to do something much more
 

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:13.610
trying to do something much more
ambitious they were trying to get a

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:13.620
ambitious they were trying to get a
 

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:16.020
ambitious they were trying to get a
solution that would work in the absence

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:16.030
solution that would work in the absence
 

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:18.570
solution that would work in the absence
of human interactions and what the

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:18.580
of human interactions and what the
 

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:21.770
of human interactions and what the
Balinese have gotten very good at use

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:21.780
Balinese have gotten very good at use
 

00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:24.390
Balinese have gotten very good at use
systematizing human interaction so they

00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:24.400
systematizing human interaction so they
 

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:26.400
systematizing human interaction so they
can know where to where to turn the taps

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:26.410
can know where to where to turn the taps
 

00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:27.960
can know where to where to turn the taps
on and where to turn the taps off

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:27.970
on and where to turn the taps off
 

00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:28.680
on and where to turn the taps off
basically

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:28.690
basically
 

00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:31.320
basically
but what runs through all of this is a

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:31.330
but what runs through all of this is a
 

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:35.550
but what runs through all of this is a
kind of systematic our way of reasoning

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:35.560
kind of systematic our way of reasoning
 

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:37.800
kind of systematic our way of reasoning
through issues thinking hard about

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:37.810
through issues thinking hard about
 

00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:39.540
through issues thinking hard about
things thinking what the possibilities

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:39.550
things thinking what the possibilities
 

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:43.110
things thinking what the possibilities
are testing them out in that sense you

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:43.120
are testing them out in that sense you
 

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:45.390
are testing them out in that sense you
might say there's a core that consists

00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:45.400
might say there's a core that consists
 

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:47.280
might say there's a core that consists
in the scientific method but it's not

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:47.290
in the scientific method but it's not
 

00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:49.440
in the scientific method but it's not
something that's just practiced by

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:49.450
something that's just practiced by
 

00:07:49.450 --> 00:07:52.860
something that's just practiced by
physicists or biologists it's practiced

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:52.870
physicists or biologists it's practiced
 

00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:55.710
physicists or biologists it's practiced
by lots of us a lot of the time in our

by lots of us a lot of the time in our
 

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:57.960
by lots of us a lot of the time in our
everyday lives when we face and try to

00:07:57.960 --> 00:07:57.970
everyday lives when we face and try to
 

00:07:57.970 --> 00:08:01.670
everyday lives when we face and try to
overcome the problems that confront us

00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:01.680
overcome the problems that confront us
