00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:04.370
- [Voiceover] We wanna figure
out what AX plus B squared is,

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:05.671
and I encourage you to pause the video

00:00:05.671 --> 00:00:06.864
and figure out what that is

00:00:06.864 --> 00:00:09.302
in terms of capital-A and capital-B.

00:00:09.302 --> 00:00:11.172
So let's work through it.

00:00:11.172 --> 00:00:14.144
This is the same thing as multiplying

00:00:14.144 --> 00:00:18.625
AX plus B times AX plus B.

00:00:18.625 --> 00:00:20.443
So let me fill that in.

00:00:21.052 --> 00:00:24.825
This is AX there, another AX there.

00:00:24.825 --> 00:00:25.869
I just wrote it in that order

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:28.453
to make the color switching
a little bit easier.

00:00:28.586 --> 00:00:31.518
So AX plus B times AX plus B.

00:00:31.732 --> 00:00:33.404
Well, what's that going to be equal to?

00:00:33.404 --> 00:00:36.746
Well, if you take this AX
and you multiply it times

00:00:36.746 --> 00:00:40.793
that AX, you're going to get AX squared.

00:00:41.403 --> 00:00:44.532
AX, the entire thing squared.

00:00:44.746 --> 00:00:48.647
And then if you take, if you take this AX

00:00:48.647 --> 00:00:51.561
and then multiply it times this B,

00:00:51.561 --> 00:00:55.734
you're going to get ABX.

00:00:56.366 --> 00:00:59.002
Then if you take this
B and you multiply it

00:00:59.002 --> 00:01:02.770
times this AX, you're
going to get another ABX.

00:01:03.273 --> 00:01:05.462
ABX.

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.976
And then last but not
least, if you take this B

00:01:07.976 --> 00:01:11.047
and multiply it times the other B,

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.367
it's going to be plus B squared.

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.341
And so what are you left with?

00:01:16.671 --> 00:01:19.550
Well, you're going to be left with A,

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:20.897
I'll write it like this,

00:01:20.897 --> 00:01:25.854
AX squared, we actually if we want,

00:01:25.854 --> 00:01:28.640
well, I'll write it in a
different way in a second,

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.541
and then you have plus, plus two,

00:01:32.541 --> 00:01:34.781
that's a slightly different color.

00:01:34.781 --> 00:01:36.604
I'm gonna do that other color.

00:01:36.604 --> 00:01:40.800
Plus two ABX,

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.639
and then finally plus B squared.

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:45.717
Plus B squared.

00:01:45.717 --> 00:01:47.296
Now, I said I could write it
in a slightly different way,

00:01:47.296 --> 00:01:50.813
what I could do is just
rewrite-out AX squared

00:01:50.813 --> 00:01:53.019
as being the same thing.

00:01:53.019 --> 00:01:58.019
This is the same thing
as A-squared X-squared,

00:01:58.278 --> 00:02:01.041
and then I can write out
everything else the same way.

00:02:01.041 --> 00:02:05.528
Plus two ABX,

00:02:05.528 --> 00:02:06.985
and then plus B squared.

00:02:06.985 --> 00:02:09.829
Now, why did I, what's
interesting about doing this?

00:02:09.829 --> 00:02:11.768
Well, now we can see the pattern

00:02:11.768 --> 00:02:15.343
for the square of any binomial

00:02:15.343 --> 00:02:17.282
or binomial like this,

00:02:17.282 --> 00:02:20.660
so for example, if someone
were to walk up to you

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:25.525
and say "alright, I have
a trinomial of the form,"

00:02:25.525 --> 00:02:28.716
let's say they have a
trinomial of the form

00:02:28.716 --> 00:02:32.408
25X squared

00:02:32.408 --> 00:02:36.761
plus 20X plus 4,

00:02:36.761 --> 00:02:38.909
and they were to tell you to factor this,

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:40.302
well, actually, let's just do that.

00:02:40.302 --> 00:02:41.370
Why don't you pause the video and see

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.087
if you could factor this as
the product of two binomials.

00:02:44.877 --> 00:02:46.261
Well, when you look at this,

00:02:46.261 --> 00:02:48.145
you'd say "well look, there's 25X squared,

00:02:48.145 --> 00:02:50.386
"that looks like a perfect square.

00:02:50.386 --> 00:02:55.099
"25X squared, that's the
same thing as five-squared

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:57.038
"x-squared,"

00:02:57.038 --> 00:03:02.038
or you could write it as five X squared.

00:03:02.268 --> 00:03:05.280
This four here, that's a perfect square.

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.374
That's the same thing as two squared.

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:10.585
And let's see, 20, right over here,

00:03:10.585 --> 00:03:12.547
if we want it to fit this pattern,

00:03:12.547 --> 00:03:16.228
we would see that A is five and B is two,

00:03:16.228 --> 00:03:19.548
and so let's see, what
would be two times AB?

00:03:19.548 --> 00:03:23.019
Well, five times two AB would be 10,

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:25.201
and then two times that would be 20.

00:03:25.201 --> 00:03:27.650
So this right over here is,

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:32.650
that is plus two times five.

00:03:33.477 --> 00:03:37.291
Two times five times two

00:03:37.291 --> 00:03:40.200
times two X.

00:03:40.588 --> 00:03:43.984
Times two X, I'll do it in this color.

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:46.062
Times two X.

00:03:46.149 --> 00:03:49.006
So you see that this completely
matches this pattern here

00:03:49.006 --> 00:03:53.579
where A is equal to five
and B is equal to two.

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:56.620
Once again, this is AX,
the whole thing squared,

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:01.514
then you have two times A times BX,

00:04:01.914 --> 00:04:03.232
you see that there,

00:04:03.296 --> 00:04:05.803
and then finally you have the B squared.

00:04:05.803 --> 00:04:08.195
So if you wanted to
factor this, you could say

00:04:08.195 --> 00:04:09.917
"well, this is just
going to the same thing

00:04:09.917 --> 00:04:11.995
"since we know what A and B are,

00:04:11.995 --> 00:04:14.920
"this is going to be five X plus two."

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:19.845
Five X plus two.

00:04:19.845 --> 00:04:24.845
Five X plus two, whole thing squared.

00:04:25.577 --> 00:04:28.314
So the whole point of doing
this is to start recognizing

00:04:28.314 --> 00:04:30.577
when we actually have perfect squares,

00:04:30.577 --> 00:04:32.818
especially perfect squares
where the leading coefficient

00:04:32.818 --> 00:04:35.552
isn't one.
