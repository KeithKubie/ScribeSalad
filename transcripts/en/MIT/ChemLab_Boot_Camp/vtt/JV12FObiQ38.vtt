00:00:00.315 --> 00:00:05.740
LINA: I feel like relationships
complicate

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:06.710
everything.

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:11.547
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:11.547 --> 00:00:13.370
LINA: Emily's actually
the biggest

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:14.966
matchmaker you've ever seen.

00:00:14.966 --> 00:00:17.050
EMILY: Speaking about
personalize lives, this

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:20.880
prompted Lina to start asking
everyone personal questions.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.720
LINA: How did you and your
husband get together?

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.500
Do you ever matchmake people?

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.145
When you look at all of us,
do you matchmake us?

00:00:30.145 --> 00:00:30.710
PHIL: No.

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:31.760
They find each other.

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.110
LINA: Really?

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:34.620
Oh.

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.340
A lot of people seem to enjoy
giving me advice.

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.560
One of the reasons my parents
wanted me to come to MIT was

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.480
so I could find a really
nice MIT man.

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.540
They want my husband
to make the money.

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.690
I want to be a strong woman
who can support herself.

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.890
I'm going to be raising my own
household of one person.

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.370
I'm going to live by myself on a
really nice mountain next to

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:08.090
a waterfall, play music, just
commune with God and nature.

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:09.830
They tell me I'm really weird.

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.970
ANTHONY: Dating here is just
like dating anywhere else.

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:14.693
IKE: I'm single.

00:01:14.693 --> 00:01:16.810
I'm single.

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:18.060
I can't commit right now.

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.070
ROO-RA: I just don't
like relationships.

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.038
IKE: Girls like too much
attention, you know?

00:01:22.038 --> 00:01:24.498
ROO-RA: I'm not into the
whole clingy thing.

00:01:24.498 --> 00:01:26.180
IKE: Because they're going
to be, oh could you

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:27.330
come take me out?

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.940
Call me.

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:28.916
Text me.

00:01:28.916 --> 00:01:31.083
ROO-RA: Let's hang out all the
time and call each other--

00:01:31.083 --> 00:01:32.562
I don't know.

00:01:32.562 --> 00:01:34.205
IKE: I can't do all that.

00:01:34.205 --> 00:01:35.045
It's too much.

00:01:35.045 --> 00:01:35.890
Too much pressure.

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:37.390
ROO-RA: Too much drama.

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:43.390
