00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
David Harris, from Colorado Springs, is asking about the courses we have

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
listed on the bottom of our home page. 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
So we do have plans to offer more courses. 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
I gather you've noticed the ones listed

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
on the bottom of the home page are fairly vague.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
They don't say, specifically, what the courses are or when they're going to start. 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
We will be announcing some courses soon; we don't want to announce 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
specifics about courses until we're really sure they're in place. 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
But there will be new courses starting in April, including several courses 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
that you'll be able to take, building just on this CS101course,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and I think they're going to be really exciting--but I can't announce them just yet. 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
But you will be hearing more about those very soon. &gt;&gt;Soon.
