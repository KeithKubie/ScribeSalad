00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Well, to solve this, we can plug in C equals 360 over alpha,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
which was 7.2 degrees times D, which is 5000 stadia.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
When we did this out with the degree is cancelled--we get a

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
value for the circumference of 250,000 stadia.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Now we're still not done because we need to convert--we're going to take our number

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:34.000
250,000 stadia times 185 meters in 1 stadium and we want to convert that to kilometers

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
so we'll multiply it by 1 kilometer for every 1000 meters.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000
When we do this, we get a final answer of 46,250 kilometers. Amazing!

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
We did this all just with some shadows, some basic knowledge of geometry,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
and a little bit of trigonometry that we have to learn as well

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Not only is it amazing that we could calculate the circumference using such basic knowledge,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.000
but the skills that we gained in doing so are skills we used throughout this course--congratulations!

00:01:04.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Now, let's see the experiment in action.
