00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:06.800
So now we set the stage for discussing the spin and the exokernel approaches

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:11.660
to achieving extensibility of the operating system without losing out on

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:15.400
protection or performance. Both these approaches

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:19.260
start with two premises. The first premise,

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.220
is that micro-kernel based design compromises

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.670
on performance due to frequent border crossings.

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:30.500
And the second premise is that, monolithic design does not lend itself to

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:37.020
extensibility. Because of the starting premises of spin and exokernal.

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.810
Both these approaches have certain commonality in what they strive to

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:46.750
do, although the path taken by these two approaches are very different.
