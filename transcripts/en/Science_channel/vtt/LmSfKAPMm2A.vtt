00:00:05.205 --> 00:00:07.774
Narrator: JUST ONE ATOM THICK
AND TRANSPARENT,

00:00:07.774 --> 00:00:10.443
GRAPHENE CAN SNIFF OUT CHEMICALS
IN THE AIR

00:00:10.443 --> 00:00:12.912
AND DISEASE ENZYMES IN BLOOD.

00:00:14.146 --> 00:00:17.449
A TECHNICIAN LOADS A CAPSULE
CONTAINING A COPPER FOIL SHEET

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:19.152
INTO A FURNACE.

00:00:19.152 --> 00:00:21.420
HE SCREWS A CAP
ON THE END OF THE CAPSULE

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.355
AND SHUTS THE FURNACE.

00:00:23.355 --> 00:00:24.690
HE ACTIVATES A SYSTEM

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:28.160
THAT USES ARGON GAS
TO DRIVE OUT OXYGEN.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.832
A REACTION OCCURS THAT DEPOSITS
GRAPHENE ONTO THE FOIL.

00:00:32.832 --> 00:00:36.469
GRAPHENE CAN'T BE SEEN
WITH THE NAKED EYE.

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:39.038
ANOTHER TECHNICIAN
DEPOSITS LIQUID PLASTIC

00:00:39.038 --> 00:00:42.107
ONTO THE TRANSPARENT GRAPHENE
ON THE COPPER FOIL.

00:00:42.107 --> 00:00:47.079
HE LOCKS THE FOIL IN A MACHINE
CALLED A SPIN COATER.

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:49.715
IT SPINS AT 3,000 R.P.M.

00:00:49.715 --> 00:00:51.217
THIS SPREADS THE PLASTIC

00:00:51.217 --> 00:00:54.387
EVENLY ACROSS THE GRAPHENE FILM
ON THE FOIL.

00:00:54.387 --> 00:00:58.258
IT ALSO ACCELERATES
THE PLASTIC'S CURING PROCESS.

00:00:58.258 --> 00:01:01.393
HE THEN SEPARATES
THE PLASTIC-COATED GRAPHENE

00:01:01.393 --> 00:01:04.164
FROM THE COPPER FOIL.

00:01:04.164 --> 00:01:07.000
USING THE TWEEZERS,
HE PICKS UP A SMALL PIECE

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.369
OF THE PLASTIC, GRAPHENE,
AND COPPER SANDWICH

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:12.538
AND PLUNGES IT IN THE WATER.

00:01:12.538 --> 00:01:15.608
THE TWEEZERS APPLY AN ELECTRICAL
CHARGE THROUGH THE COPPER,

00:01:15.608 --> 00:01:18.110
CAUSING BUBBLES
TO FORM IN THE WATER.

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:19.979
THESE BUBBLES LIFT THE GRAPHENE

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.048
AND PLASTIC FILM
AWAY FROM THE COPPER.

00:01:23.048 --> 00:01:27.186
THE GRAPHENE NOW CLINGS
ONLY TO THE PLASTIC BACKING.

00:01:27.186 --> 00:01:30.189
HE SCOOPS THE PLASTIC-BACKED
GRAPHENE SQUARE

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:33.793
OUT OF THE WATER USING
A LARGE PIECE OF PLASTIC.

00:01:33.793 --> 00:01:35.194
TO REMOVE CONTAMINANTS,

00:01:35.194 --> 00:01:38.797
HE IMMERSES THE SQUARE
IN A SERIES OF SOLUTIONS.

00:01:38.797 --> 00:01:40.099
IN THE LAST SOLUTION,

00:01:40.099 --> 00:01:42.668
HE SLIDES THE SQUARE
OFF THE CARRIER.

00:01:42.668 --> 00:01:44.637
AND THE SQUARE FLOATS FREELY.

00:01:44.637 --> 00:01:47.806
HE PICKS UP THE SILICON CHIP
WITH TWEEZERS

00:01:47.806 --> 00:01:50.710
AND USES IT TO RETRIEVE
THE FLOATING GRAPHENE

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.077
AND PLASTIC SQUARE.

00:01:52.077 --> 00:01:54.480
HE SUSPENDS THEM
ABOVE GOLD PELLETS

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:57.250
IN A MACHINE KNOWN AS
THE EVAPORATOR.

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.922
A VACUUM PULLS THE GOLD
TOWARD THE STENCILS

00:02:02.922 --> 00:02:04.324
AS IT EVAPORATES.

00:02:07.526 --> 00:02:09.329
THE GOLD AND EXPOSED GRAPHENE

00:02:09.329 --> 00:02:12.732
ADHERE TO ONE ANOTHER
AS THEY COOL AND SOLIDIFY.

00:02:12.732 --> 00:02:15.934
HE TRANSFERS THE CHIP
TO A PLASMA ETCHER.

00:02:15.934 --> 00:02:17.536
HE ACTIVATES THE CHIP,

00:02:17.536 --> 00:02:20.105
AND PLASMA GAS
FLOODS THE CHAMBER.

00:02:20.105 --> 00:02:23.976
THE GAS STRIPS OFF ANY GRAPHENE
THAT'S NOT PROTECTED BY GOLD.

00:02:23.976 --> 00:02:25.911
ONLY THE GOLD CONTACTS

00:02:25.911 --> 00:02:29.081
AND GOLD-COVERED GRAPHENE
RUNNERS REMAIN ON THE CHIP.

00:02:29.081 --> 00:02:32.017
SOLVENT DISSOLVES
THE PLASTIC BACKING

00:02:32.017 --> 00:02:33.453
ON THE GRAPHENE RUNNERS,

00:02:33.453 --> 00:02:37.590
TAKING THE PROTECTIVE GOLD
WITH IT, LEAVING ONLY GRAPHENE.
