00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
In this problem, we were tasked with figuring out how strong this force F has to be

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
to keep this trolley, which has a mass of 1000 kg,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
moving at a constant rate up this incline of 10 degrees.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
The first thing I want to do here is diagram all the forces that are acting on the troller,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and there are three forces acting on our trolley.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
There is this force F, which corresponds to the road pushing the trolley up the hill.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
There is the normal force acting perpendicular to the slope,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and there is the force of gravity, which points straight down.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
As we've done in the past, we can break down the force of gravity 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
into components that are parallel to the incline and perpendicular to the incline.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
You'll remember that this angle here is the same as this angle here.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
They're both 10 degrees. All right.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Now, we know that we want this trolley to move at a constant velocity,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
which means that it can't be accelerating, so acceleration has to be 0.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
If it's not accelerating, that means there can't be any net force acting on the trolley.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
The net force also has to be equal to 0.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
If the net force is equal to 0, that means all of these forces perfectly balance each other out.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Let's look at the perpendicular direction first.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
There is some component of the force of gravity acting perpendicular to the incline,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
but we don't need to worry about that, since we know that's going to be perfectly 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
balanced out by the normal force here.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
We also know that this force F has to exactly equal the component of gravity

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
that's parallel to the incline.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
That gives us this equation here.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Now using some trigonometry, I know that F is equal to the full force of gravity

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
times the sine of 10 degrees,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
and of course the force of gravity is just equal to mg.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Plugging in numbers here, I find that the force F required to keep the trolley moving 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:32.000
at a constant velocity is equal to 1,736 Newtons. Great work.
