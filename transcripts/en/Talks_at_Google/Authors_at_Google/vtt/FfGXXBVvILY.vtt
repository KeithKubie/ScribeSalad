Martha Stewart @Google
November 4, 2011

00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:02.260
&gt;&gt;Marissa Mayer: Good morning.

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:04.440
Today, we have with us Martha Stewart.

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:12.000
[ Cheers and applause ]
&gt;&gt;Marissa Mayer: And Martha's stats are really

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.000
impressive.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.120
We think a lot about stats and data here at
Google.

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.510
But these are pretty amazing.

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:21.330
37 million readers, users, viewers, and listeners
each month.

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:27.230
She inspires them to celebrate art in their
everyday living through cooking, gardening,

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:32.470
entertaining, organizing their holidays, pets,
their entire lifestyle.

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:36.280
Today we're here to look at her most personal
book yet.

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:41.039
She literally invites readers into her home
for a year's worth of celebrations across

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:43.780
all times of day and all seasons.

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:50.420
This book is a return to her first book, "Entertaining,"
which actually established Martha as a household

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.280
name more than 30 years ago.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.749
And this is her 75th book.

00:00:56.749 --> 00:01:03.549
I heard that on Jay Leno, and I thought it
was a joke, but it is actually her 75th book.

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:08.420
1800 recipes each year in her magazines, properties,
and Martha Stewart Show.

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.970
And she's also won 18 Emmys.

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:18.150
And proximate to our industry, she's also
won the Webby for the best lifestyle Web site.

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.620
Please welcome Martha Stewart.

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:26.890
[ Cheers and applause ]
&gt;&gt;Martha Stewart: Hello.

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:28.970
Hi, everybody.

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.110
Thank you, Marissa.

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:38.130
&gt;&gt;Marissa Mayer: We are so delighted to have
you here.

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.640
&gt;&gt;Martha Stewart: I just tweeted.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.090
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Marissa Mayer: That's great.

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.710
We're so excited here -- to have you here
today.

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.010
You can see the Googlers are all so excited
that you have made the trip to come and see

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:50.790
us here in Mountain View.

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.140
And I'm going to ask you a few questions,
we have a lot of questions from the audience

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.000
later, we've also been collecting questions
ahead of time, and actually, the first one

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.670
was a bit of a joke from Ted Prodromou.

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.780
He asked, do you have any suggestions for
decorating Charlie's Cafe, which is the room

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:07.780
that we're in.

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.709
&gt;&gt;Martha Stewart: The flowers are very fancy
for Charlie's Cafe.

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.859
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Marissa Mayer: Thank you.

00:02:12.859 --> 00:02:15.010
&gt;&gt;Martha Stewart: They are beautiful.

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.909
Succulents and ORCHIDS and roses.

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:19.659
Very beautiful.

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:23.150
No, you can't decorate a place like this.

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:28.150
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Martha Stewart: It's already the place.

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:29.400
And it's so exciting to be here.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.400
I'm really happy.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.400
Thank you.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.749
&gt;&gt;Marissa Mayer: It's a very functional space,
if not a very decorated space.

00:02:33.749 --> 00:02:38.819
But I what I wanted to go ahead and start
off with is where you started.

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:43.319
Because I think what a lot of people don't
know and I was surprised, I got to visit your

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:48.360
office and your studio last year, is that
you actually started off as a model.

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.360
&gt;&gt;Martha Stewart: I did.

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:50.360
&gt;&gt;Marissa Mayer: A world-renowned model.

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.609
We actually have this beautiful photo of Martha
when she was a model.

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:52.609
(Whistles).

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:58.950
&gt;&gt;Marissa Mayer: And, of course, we also have
the Google Image search.

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:04.400
If you type in "Martha Stewart model," you
can see all of her model shots.

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:05.939
&gt;&gt;Martha Stewart: Oh, look.

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:07.970
Where that did that waist go?

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.090
&gt;&gt;Marissa Mayer: Just stunningly beautiful.

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:17.200
I guess I would love to hear the story of
how you went from a model to becoming a do-it-yourself

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.319
icon and how you --
&gt;&gt;Martha Stewart: Well, before I was a model,

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:21.939
I was actually a student.

00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:22.939
&gt;&gt;Marissa Mayer: Okay.

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:28.170
&gt;&gt;Martha Stewart: And during high school,
in order -- one of six kids, my father was

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:33.200
a pharmaceutical salesman, and my mother was
a teacher, sixth-grade teacher.

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.859
And there was no extra money to go to college.

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:39.400
There was no extra money to buy beautiful
clothes.

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.000
And I loved beautiful clothes.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.549
My mother was quite well dressed, but she
made everything.

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:49.159
So we learned how to sew, we learned how to
do all those homely things at home.

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:56.260
So I started modeling when I was 13 to pay
for extras, like college.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:03.799
And it was very successful, because in those
days, college was only $3500 a year, including

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:04.870
room and board.

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:10.299
And that's very cheap compared to what it
is now, $55,000, 75,000, whatever.

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:16.320
So I did commercials, television commercials,
and I did print ads and print editorial.

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:24.560
And it was a lot of fun, and it paid $50 an
hour at that time, which was a lot of money.

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:30.140
And my commercials appeared on things like
"Gunsmoke" and "Wyatt Earp" and different

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:34.350
-- So it was a very, very good way to earn
money.

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:38.490
So it wasn't really -- and all during college,
too, I went to Barnard college at Columbia

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:41.190
University, and at that time, too, I was modeling.

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:44.520
&gt;&gt;Marissa Mayer: How did you make the transition
from model to, you know --

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:45.520
&gt;&gt;Martha Stewart: To whatever?

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:50.290
&gt;&gt;Marissa Mayer: I mean, your own show and
to being really a do-it-yourself icon.

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:54.590
&gt;&gt;Martha Stewart: After college and during
college, I was -- my father-in-law happened

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:55.890
to be a stockbroker.

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:57.690
He owned a seat on the New York Stock Exchange.

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:00.850
And I got interested in investing.

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:07.460
It was as interesting then, really, as it
is now, although the money wasn't as great.

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:12.350
But you could, if you invested in McDonald's,
for example, in the early days, it was -- that

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:14.580
was one of the most successful investments.

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:19.040
Or in a thing like -- it was called Leasco
Data Processing, a very good investment if

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:25.570
you bought warrants, on warrants, and you
invested kind of crazily like my little firm

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:26.590
that I belonged to.

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:31.900
I became a stockbroker right after college
because I thought that would be an interesting

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:33.380
way to learn about business.

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:39.490
And it was, because I learned about how a
good company or even a bad company functioned.

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:42.290
But this was before big-time technology.

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:47.730
And I gave up the stock market after about
an eight-year career, which was -- which I

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:49.390
loved very much.

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:50.990
And I started a catering business.

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:54.440
The catering is what led me into the lifestyle
business.

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:56.730
And the writing of my first book in 1982.

00:05:56.730 --> 00:06:00.880
&gt;&gt;Marissa Mayer: How did Martha Stewart Living
Omnimedia get started.

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:07.120
&gt;&gt;Martha Stewart: Well, I wanted to -- I had
so many ideas for lifestyle, and I realized

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:11.560
that there were voids in the media world.

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:21.170
There was no one book, for example, like "Entertaining"
that would teach you really the basic tenets

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:24.330
of good home entertaining.

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:26.550
There was no great garden book.

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:29.520
And these are illustrated books.

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:30.650
I loved photography.

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:34.280
I loved colored photography especially.

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:38.390
And so I went to my publisher and I said,
"I'd like to do a whole series of beautiful

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:43.020
how-to books so people could really learn
how to do everything."

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:48.110
And they said, "Eh, it's all right, but, you
know, you just keep writing your book a year."

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:49.990
And I was writing a book a year.

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:56.740
So then I went to Sy Newhouse, who is the
head of Conde Nast Publishing, and he said,

00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:59.510
"Well, that sounds like a magazine."

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:05.290
And so I gave him a proposal for a magazine,
and then it went on from there.

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:12.110
So I started Martha Stewart Living, the magazine,
not with Conde Nast, but with Time Warner,

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:13.550
in 1990.

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:21.790
And from there, everything else has grown,
especially the idea of synergy between media,

00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:25.640
television, bringing all the -- all kinds
of media together.

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:28.330
And then, of course, Internet, and then merchandising.

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:32.120
&gt;&gt;Marissa Mayer: You can see the whole array
of different magazines.

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:33.640
That probably isn't even all of them.

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:36.699
&gt;&gt;Martha Stewart: Yeah, you're missing Everyday
Food magazine, our smaller magazine there.

00:07:36.699 --> 00:07:40.740
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Marissa Mayer: So what were the early days

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:42.360
at Martha Stewart Living like?

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:43.950
&gt;&gt;Martha Stewart: Well, it was so much fun.

00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:50.700
We were -- we consider ourselves a microcosm
of a big media company, Time Warner.

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:52.700
And we were very proud of being that microcosm.

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:58.150
We were put on the most unfriendly floor in
the time -- in the Time Warner Tower on Sixth

00:07:58.150 --> 00:07:59.340
Avenue.

00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:03.460
Below us was all the mechanics of the building.

00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:09.400
So my feet were warm because it was a hot
floor, and probably an unhealthy floor.

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:10.460
I hated it.

00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:12.770
The windows didn't open.

00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:16.360
We were on the, like, fifty something floor
and you wouldn't want your windows to open

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:18.110
up there.

00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:21.210
It was unhealthy in that respect.

00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:22.770
No fresh air.

00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:24.400
Hermetically sealed.

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:29.490
And ever since that little time, I stayed
in that office for about a year and a half,

00:08:29.490 --> 00:08:31.139
and I begged to move.

00:08:31.139 --> 00:08:35.580
And we found a space that, -- with windows
that opened, with fresh air, with natural

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:38.330
gas for the stoves for our kitchens.

00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:41.540
All of that meant a lot for me, sunlight,
daylight.

00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:43.440
It was very important.

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:45.830
And ever since then, we've -- and you've been
to our office.

00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:50.480
And you know that we have sunlight and daylight,
much like you have out here, all much smaller.

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:53.130
&gt;&gt;Marissa Mayer: Well, you're here in Silicon
Valley.

00:08:53.130 --> 00:08:55.150
And it's the heart of innovation.

00:08:55.150 --> 00:08:59.110
And you're one of the few people in the world
who has actually defined an industry.

00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:04.870
So what words of advice do you have for young
entrepreneurs as to how they might try and

00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:05.870
do the same?

00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:11.410
We have a lot of people here who are entrepreneurs
within Google and trying to build new businesses.

00:09:11.410 --> 00:09:17.990
&gt;&gt;Martha Stewart: Again, it's finding a void,
I think, in your area of interest and expertise,

00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:25.000
finding that void that other people really
also consider a void, and building in that

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:32.050
void something that is so original and so
enticing and so desirable that many other

00:09:32.050 --> 00:09:34.430
people will have to come there.

00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:37.840
I mean, -- well, that's what Google is.

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:39.360
Had you to come to Google.

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:41.010
There was no choice.

00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:42.380
There was no other way.

00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:47.750
There were other companies, but it was by
far the most interesting place to go.

00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:54.070
I was an early adapter or adopter of technology,
and I bought my first computer -- it doesn't

00:09:54.070 --> 00:10:00.030
sound like very long ago -- but 1982, I bought
my first IBM computer, a PC.

00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:01.089
I still have it.

00:10:01.089 --> 00:10:04.580
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Martha Stewart: I haven't plugged it in.

00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:06.420
I don't even -- I haven't even tried.

00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:10.210
But I still have it, that silly-looking little
thing.

00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:13.810
But it was so interesting what was going on.

00:10:13.810 --> 00:10:15.840
And I've tried to keep up.

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:18.000
I know there's lots I don't know.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:23.090
But as much as I can, I keep up with the newest.

00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:30.390
And I watch with interest the new IPOs that
are happening, like the Groupon this morning.

00:10:30.390 --> 00:10:35.680
And testing the waters for what else we are
going to be distracted with in our quest for

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:38.880
our own particular interests; right?

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:42.130
There's a lot of distracting stuff out there,
Marissa, really.

00:10:42.130 --> 00:10:46.540
&gt;&gt;Marissa Mayer: It's interesting, we're about
a half a mile down the road from the Computer

00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:50.250
History Museum, which always to me seems like
a oxymoron, because it's such a short history.

00:10:50.250 --> 00:10:52.620
It's really amazing to see --
&gt;&gt;Martha Stewart: Oh, it is.

00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:55.290
It's like a fragment of time.

00:10:55.290 --> 00:11:00.380
&gt;&gt;Marissa Mayer: So what are the three -- if
you had to name three really important lessons

00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:04.520
that you've learned throughout evolving your
business, you've been so successful, what

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:06.150
are three of the most important lessons?

00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:11.730
&gt;&gt;Martha Stewart: Well, finding that niche
that interests you and will interest others,

00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:16.591
that's one very, very -- and a niche -- a
niche can be as big as the Grand Canyon, you

00:11:16.591 --> 00:11:17.770
know?

00:11:17.770 --> 00:11:19.960
It doesn't have to be a tiny little space.

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:22.420
It can be a giant space.

00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:30.970
And then creating content or something to
fill that cavern or canyon with something

00:11:30.970 --> 00:11:34.470
really valuable and well-made.

00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:38.520
And it can be pretty, too, like your beautiful
Google Maps.

00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:44.690
Like your -- and like so many things that
you find on the Internet that are appealing

00:11:44.690 --> 00:11:47.590
to the eye but are understandable at the same
time.

00:11:47.590 --> 00:11:50.180
And then, third, just continue with it.

00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:52.800
And don't forget to look elsewhere.

00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:57.530
Don't forget to look at what's coming up behind
you, what's coming in front of you.

00:11:57.530 --> 00:12:00.310
Always keeping as current as possible.

00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:01.660
Okay.

00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:03.899
And you have so much variety in your business.

00:12:03.899 --> 00:12:07.950
You know, there's cooking, there's crafting,
there's organizing, there's weddings, blogging,

00:12:07.950 --> 00:12:11.630
there's tweeting, there's the TV show, there's
the radio show.

00:12:11.630 --> 00:12:14.060
How do you decide to go into a new area?

00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:16.480
How do you decide to explore a new venture?

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:22.470
&gt;&gt;Martha Stewart: Well, we were very Avid
explorers in all kinds of media from the first

00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:23.750
place.

00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:30.050
We were also very Avid in exploring retail
business -- merchandising businesses.

00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:35.370
And we continue to be so, although we now
know that you cannot, even as a corporation,

00:12:35.370 --> 00:12:39.430
do every single thing that you want to do.

00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:47.120
And you must concentrate on those areas that
are really the most profitable, the most interesting,

00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:50.710
the most -- have the most future, have the
most growth potential.

00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:56.210
So that's what we're doing now, is figuring
out, with our company, our small company,

00:12:56.210 --> 00:12:59.730
what really we should be focusing on.

00:12:59.730 --> 00:13:00.960
&gt;&gt;Marissa Mayer: Okay.

00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:03.180
Well, we have a little video I'd like to show.

00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:08.140
Because one of the things we've seen is that
users are constantly Googling you.

00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:13.550
They're constantly Googling you, your recipes,
the crafts, your products.

00:13:13.550 --> 00:13:18.580
You can see there's so much inspiration.

00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:23.990
And you've gone to great lengths to make all
of your content really accessible online.

00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:25.490
&gt;&gt;Martha Stewart: Yes, we have.

00:13:25.490 --> 00:13:30.529
&gt;&gt;Marissa Mayer: And I guess I'd like to --
&gt;&gt;Martha Stewart: Have you made a croquembouche?

00:13:30.529 --> 00:13:36.440
&gt;&gt;Marissa Mayer: Unfortunately, I can't really
cook, but my husband is a fabulous cook.

00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:41.030
So, --
&gt;&gt;Martha Stewart: Do you embroider?

00:13:41.030 --> 00:13:42.190
&gt;&gt;Marissa Mayer: I do embroider.

00:13:42.190 --> 00:13:43.190
I do.

00:13:43.190 --> 00:13:44.630
I do, especially cross stitch.

00:13:44.630 --> 00:13:49.580
I do like to sew, and I like to do crafts
with LEDs.

00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:53.100
But -- so I like to do, like, light displays
and things.

00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:57.000
But people have, obviously, been so inspired
by what you have done.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:01.399
Part of it is that you have made so much of
what you do really accessible to them through

00:14:01.399 --> 00:14:02.399
the Internet.

00:14:02.399 --> 00:14:06.820
So I thought I -- I'd like you to talk a little
bit about how the Internet has changed your

00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:09.890
business, how it's made you more accessible
to users?

00:14:09.890 --> 00:14:12.870
&gt;&gt;Martha Stewart: Well, it's changed it tremendously.

00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:16.910
And we want to be where our customers need
and want us.

00:14:16.910 --> 00:14:22.260
And more and more of our customers really
do want us on the Internet.

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:30.250
As the population of tablet owners grows,
we were very aware of that, and we wanted

00:14:30.250 --> 00:14:32.890
to be there with the best apps possible.

00:14:32.890 --> 00:14:36.300
I wish we had a picture of the app, the Martha
Stewart Living app.

00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:38.590
That we should have put up.

00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:40.930
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Marissa Mayer: Sorry.

00:14:40.930 --> 00:14:42.690
&gt;&gt;Martha Stewart: Yes.

00:14:42.690 --> 00:14:46.460
But if you have a chance to look at it, I
suggest you look at it.

00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:51.640
The first issue of Martha Stewart Living that
went up was a specially prepared issue for

00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:53.810
the iPad.

00:14:53.810 --> 00:15:02.360
But it is so amazing how you can transform
a print magazine into something alive and

00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:08.520
vibrant, more vibrant than the real printed
magazine.

00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:15.510
And now every month, we prepare -- we prepare
tablet versions of our magazines, two of them,

00:15:15.510 --> 00:15:17.740
Everyday Food, and Martha Stewart Living.

00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:24.950
And the people who work, the editors who work
on these apps, are very happy working on them.

00:15:24.950 --> 00:15:30.790
They love creating the imagery, which is a
little different from print photographs.

00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:35.850
But the photographers love it, the editors
love it, the writers love it, and the users

00:15:35.850 --> 00:15:36.850
love it.

00:15:36.850 --> 00:15:38.399
They love looking at it.

00:15:38.399 --> 00:15:39.610
So we're doing that.

00:15:39.610 --> 00:15:46.820
We have a couple of fantastic apps, the cookie
app, cupcake app, which -- a drinks app.

00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:51.010
That's a really good one, if you're -- when
you get home from work on a Friday night,

00:15:51.010 --> 00:15:52.830
that's a good one to go to for some inspiration.

00:15:52.830 --> 00:15:57.320
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Martha Stewart: And so we're doing that.

00:15:57.320 --> 00:16:03.040
We're working very hard to get across -- I
do a daily blog which reaches, oh, on average,

00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:09.560
maybe 5- or 600,000 page views a day, which,
for a blog, and one of 12 blogs in our company,

00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:11.850
is pretty good.

00:16:11.850 --> 00:16:13.830
But people get to know you.

00:16:13.830 --> 00:16:19.690
They get to understand the value of what you're
trying to set forth.

00:16:19.690 --> 00:16:20.690
And I like that.

00:16:20.690 --> 00:16:23.760
It's a personal -- My blog is a pretty personal
blog.

00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:29.751
Lots of views of snowstorms and tragedies,
and the tragedies, the broken trees, those

00:16:29.751 --> 00:16:32.290
get the most page views, the death of a dog.

00:16:32.290 --> 00:16:33.290
Oh, my gosh.

00:16:33.290 --> 00:16:36.769
You know, it's sad, but that's what happens,
people like that.

00:16:36.769 --> 00:16:39.190
They want to commiserate.

00:16:39.190 --> 00:16:47.920
But that's -- So and we are really using as
much -- even this little device, the Nook,

00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:55.240
where you just send a PDF of a magazine to
the Nook, the economics are very favorable,

00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:57.040
and I wondered, you know, how would it do?

00:16:57.040 --> 00:17:01.850
Well, actually, the Nooks are selling well,
and the subscriptions via the Nook's selling

00:17:01.850 --> 00:17:02.970
well.

00:17:02.970 --> 00:17:05.130
So we have to figure it out.

00:17:05.130 --> 00:17:07.670
Advertisers haven't figured it out yet.

00:17:07.670 --> 00:17:09.559
Publishers haven't figured it out yet.

00:17:09.559 --> 00:17:14.380
Maybe Google has answers for me today about
what's going to happen here.

00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:21.699
But it is -- we're in a very important stage
of transition right now with media especially.

00:17:21.699 --> 00:17:25.770
Where are you going to access your information
regularly?

00:17:25.770 --> 00:17:29.580
Is it going to be in that beautiful magazine
that you can open and page through?

00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:31.830
Or is it going to be on your tablet?

00:17:31.830 --> 00:17:33.820
We don't know for sure yet.

00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:35.610
But I can see sort of where it's going.

00:17:35.610 --> 00:17:38.350
&gt;&gt;Marissa Mayer: We have some exciting demos
to show you later today.

00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:41.820
But, yes, I think we're all very excited about
tablets, particularly Android tablets.

00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:45.750
&gt;&gt;Martha Stewart: Yes, and I said -- I don't
have one yet.

00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:48.260
&gt;&gt;Marissa Mayer: Well, we'll make sure we
change that today.

00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:53.690
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Marissa Mayer: We can hook you up with Android

00:17:53.690 --> 00:17:54.690
tablet.

00:17:54.690 --> 00:17:55.960
We have a few of those around.

00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:57.400
&gt;&gt;Martha Stewart: I had one in Italian.

00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:58.400
That didn't do so well.

00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:02.130
No, but yesterday, I was talking to one of
my publishers, who's traveling with me on

00:18:02.130 --> 00:18:08.990
this book tour, and I was saying, you know,
I have all my books in one place now.

00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:12.680
I don't have to have a suitcase just to carry
the books that I'm reading.

00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:17.400
And I used to read one book from cover to
cover, and I wouldn't pick up another book,

00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:19.890
Marissa, until I finished that book.

00:18:19.890 --> 00:18:21.280
And I knew I was finished with it.

00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:27.710
But now, with the tablet, you can just -- you
can put in any number, hundreds and hundreds

00:18:27.710 --> 00:18:32.360
of books, and just pick up where you left
off on any number of books, and it's a very

00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:33.360
-- it's confusing.

00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:34.360
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Marissa Mayer: It's confusing and convenient.

00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:36.150
But I'm the same way.

00:18:36.150 --> 00:18:38.710
&gt;&gt;Martha Stewart: It's very convenient.

00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:39.710
But it is confusing.

00:18:39.710 --> 00:18:43.710
&gt;&gt;Marissa Mayer: But it is nice to be actually
able to jump around between the books.

00:18:43.710 --> 00:18:48.350
On the topic of the blog, one of the interesting
things you have done is created Martha's Circle,

00:18:48.350 --> 00:18:51.930
which is actually a community of bloggers
that interact with you.

00:18:51.930 --> 00:18:52.930
&gt;&gt;Martha Stewart: Yes.

00:18:52.930 --> 00:18:54.670
&gt;&gt;Marissa Mayer: Can you tell us a little
bit more about that, what inspired you, what

00:18:54.670 --> 00:18:57.250
are some of the interesting things that have
happened in Martha's Circle?

00:18:57.250 --> 00:18:59.280
&gt;&gt;Martha Stewart: We like other bloggers.

00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:05.049
We've done programs on our television show
of just an audience full of bloggers, and

00:19:05.049 --> 00:19:06.790
we let them blog all during the show.

00:19:06.790 --> 00:19:08.480
And it's a lot of fun.

00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:17.600
But blogging is kind of a wonderful way to
communicate with a vast audience and to get

00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:21.470
a vast number of opinions about something.

00:19:21.470 --> 00:19:26.450
And it's so much fun to see who's doing really
well in the blogosphere, who isn't.

00:19:26.450 --> 00:19:34.520
We try to put in our circle bloggers who are
actually sort of in tune with what we're doing,

00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:39.679
maybe even more avant-garde or less -- you
know, just to bring a community together,

00:19:39.679 --> 00:19:40.760
a bigger community.

00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:42.130
&gt;&gt;Marissa Mayer: That's great.

00:19:42.130 --> 00:19:44.010
Let's talk a little bit about the television
show.

00:19:44.010 --> 00:19:47.520
Over the years, I think you've had everybody.

00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:52.420
You get these amazing celebrities, and you
get them all to do crafts and teach them cooking

00:19:52.420 --> 00:19:53.420
and everything else.

00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:55.120
Who have been the most entertaining?

00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:56.760
Do you have some favorite guests.

00:19:56.760 --> 00:20:00.370
&gt;&gt;Martha Stewart: Last week, I had Hugh Jackman
on.

00:20:00.370 --> 00:20:04.860
And I had just seen his you in movie, Real
Steel, which, well, it depends if you like

00:20:04.860 --> 00:20:06.000
robots or not.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:12.250
If you like robots, go see it, because it's
quite extraordinary, these boxing robots who

00:20:12.250 --> 00:20:15.530
smash each other to death.

00:20:15.530 --> 00:20:22.630
But luckily, I had seen it, and he is charming,
absolutely charming, and he is self-effacing

00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:24.530
and a very talented man.

00:20:24.530 --> 00:20:30.100
He happens to live across the street, and
his windows are in direct view of my daughter's

00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:36.040
apartment, so we can sort of watch him and
say we wave to each other when he's in there.

00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:39.690
So I knew everything he was doing in his apartment,
and he knows everything that my daughter's

00:20:39.690 --> 00:20:40.980
doing in her apartment.

00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:41.980
That was fun.

00:20:41.980 --> 00:20:43.540
But he's a great guy.

00:20:43.540 --> 00:20:49.720
And guests like that who are very sort of
proactive and get into the -- get into the

00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:51.750
segment that we're trying to do.

00:20:51.750 --> 00:20:58.049
Some actors really are actors, and they don't
-- unless they have a script and a director,

00:20:58.049 --> 00:20:59.950
they really can't do anything.

00:20:59.950 --> 00:21:00.950
I mean --
&gt;&gt;Marissa Mayer: Wow.

00:21:00.950 --> 00:21:05.470
&gt;&gt;Martha Stewart: They even admit, one actor
said to me, I said, "Gosh, that scene in the

00:21:05.470 --> 00:21:11.320
'Cherry Orchard,'" a Chekhov play, I said,
"Gosh, you talk about cherry trees so knowledgably."

00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:15.679
He said, "I don't know a fuck about cherry
trees.

Yeah, it's not a sequel, because it's quite
different.

00:23:38.049 --> 00:23:39.049

to entertain, a picture book with beautiful

I was catering at the time.

And this one is really all personal parties.

00:23:43.049 --> 00:23:44.049
And I also had Betsy Hawes, Elizabeth Hawes,
help me write that first book.

00:23:44.049 --> 00:23:45.049

That's another thing that anybody contemplating
writing or creating something like that, if

00:23:48.049 --> 00:23:49.049
you don't know how to do it, find somebody
who does know how to do it and can kind of

was going to say.

until I finished on my third-floor craft room,

to include in the book?

00:27:07.900 --> 00:27:12.549
a pound, it takes a long time -- would be
ready when the guests got there, which was

00:27:12.549 --> 00:27:15.840
about two and a half hours from New York.

00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:21.200
And I fell back to sleep in a dead sleep,
I was exhausted, and I had asked my husband

00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:24.360
to preheat the oven to 300 degrees.

00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:26.470
He had just put it on broil.

00:27:26.470 --> 00:27:30.640
So we woke up to a house full of black smoke.

00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:35.880
The turkey was totally charred on the outside.

00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:37.220
And this was at 7:00 a.m.

00:27:37.220 --> 00:27:38.220
And I started to cry.

00:27:38.220 --> 00:27:39.890
And I got in the car, jumped in the car.

00:27:39.890 --> 00:27:41.200
My husband thought I was leaving him.

00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:43.850
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Martha Stewart: I should have then.

00:27:43.850 --> 00:27:45.679
It would have been better.

00:27:45.679 --> 00:27:47.150
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Martha Stewart: Better.

00:27:47.150 --> 00:27:48.150
No, I'm just kidding.

00:27:48.150 --> 00:27:53.220
But I drove down to the turkey farm at the
end -- it was really, virtually at the end

00:27:53.220 --> 00:27:54.220
of the road.

00:27:54.220 --> 00:27:59.059
And they had one turkey, semi-frozen, still
there that they hadn't sold.

00:27:59.059 --> 00:28:03.760
I grabbed it, took it back home, took the
stuffing out of the other turkey, but it in.

00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:05.830
Put it back in the oven.

00:28:05.830 --> 00:28:08.230
Thanksgiving dinner was about five hours late.

00:28:08.230 --> 00:28:11.370
But the relatives, they went along with it.

00:28:11.370 --> 00:28:17.050
And that blackened turkey -- now there are
recipes for blackened turkey for God's sake.

00:28:17.050 --> 00:28:19.830
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Martha Stewart: Sorry, sorry.

00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:24.720
&gt;&gt;Marissa Mayer: Well, we've been collecting
questions from Googlers.

00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:28.850
And Bob Fowler, one of our Googlers, wants
to ask, when entertaining, what is more important,

00:28:28.850 --> 00:28:30.270
food or presentation?

00:28:30.270 --> 00:28:31.690
&gt;&gt;Martha Stewart: Food.

00:28:31.690 --> 00:28:34.110
&gt;&gt;Marissa Mayer: And what is your favorite
holiday food?

00:28:34.110 --> 00:28:38.190
&gt;&gt;Martha Stewart: My favorite holiday food.

00:28:38.190 --> 00:28:39.190
For Christmas, eggnog.

00:28:39.190 --> 00:28:40.190
&gt;&gt;Marissa Mayer: Okay.

00:28:40.190 --> 00:28:44.210
And do you have a least-favorite dish to cook?

00:28:44.210 --> 00:28:46.510
Is there something that you really don't like
to cook?

00:28:46.510 --> 00:28:51.360
&gt;&gt;Martha Stewart: Well, if I don't like to
cook it, I don't cook it.

00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:52.360
You have your choice.

00:28:52.360 --> 00:28:55.420
There's nobody who's forcing you in your own
kitchen to cook something.

00:28:55.420 --> 00:28:59.840
&gt;&gt;Marissa Mayer: We recently acquired Zagat.

00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:01.360
And Zagat is all about restaurants.

00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:02.380
Do you have favorite restaurants?

00:29:02.380 --> 00:29:03.380
&gt;&gt;Martha Stewart: Everywhere.

00:29:03.380 --> 00:29:06.950
&gt;&gt;Marissa Mayer: A favorite restaurant in
New York, anywhere in the world, in San Francisco?

00:29:06.950 --> 00:29:11.670
&gt;&gt;Martha Stewart: In New York, one of my favorite
restaurants, just because the ambience is

00:29:11.670 --> 00:29:18.049
wonderful, the look of the restaurant is so
exquisite, and the food is really, really

00:29:18.049 --> 00:29:22.330
good, it's a Japanese restaurant called En,
E-n, Brasserie.

00:29:22.330 --> 00:29:25.850
The young couple who owns it, she's from Tokyo.

00:29:25.850 --> 00:29:27.159
It's superb food.

00:29:27.159 --> 00:29:29.200
I go there a lot.

00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:31.910
It's congenial and very, very nice.

00:29:31.910 --> 00:29:33.820
And it stays open late.

00:29:33.820 --> 00:29:34.940
And I like that one a lot.

00:29:34.940 --> 00:29:37.580
But then I like all the great chefs, too.

00:29:37.580 --> 00:29:38.730
&gt;&gt;Marissa Mayer: Sure.

00:29:38.730 --> 00:29:40.680
Let's change gears to technology.

00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:45.010
When did you realize the Web was going to
be this incredible catalyst for your media

00:29:45.010 --> 00:29:46.010
empire?

00:29:46.010 --> 00:29:47.010
&gt;&gt;Martha Stewart: Well.

00:29:47.010 --> 00:29:50.860
&gt;&gt;Marissa Mayer: Was there a moment you can
pinpoint, where you were, like, "Wow, this

00:29:50.860 --> 00:29:52.470
Web thing is really going to be happen"?

00:29:52.470 --> 00:29:53.880
&gt;&gt;Martha Stewart: Well, pretty -- Let me see.

00:29:53.880 --> 00:30:02.419
When we started with our business on the Internet,
it was immediately very attractive, very enticing,

00:30:02.419 --> 00:30:04.230
and very important.

00:30:04.230 --> 00:30:06.559
So I would say maybe ten years ago.

00:30:06.559 --> 00:30:08.289
&gt;&gt;Marissa Mayer: Okay.

00:30:08.289 --> 00:30:12.909
Another question from a Googler, Eugenia Bazigos
asks, you're quite active on Twitter.

00:30:12.909 --> 00:30:14.659
You tweeted on your way out here.

00:30:14.659 --> 00:30:19.100
I just started to follow your boards on Pinterest,
which is a new startup I would say that is

00:30:19.100 --> 00:30:21.030
getting a lot of buzz right now.

00:30:21.030 --> 00:30:23.370
I'm very impressed that you're actually already
on Pinterest.

00:30:23.370 --> 00:30:24.780
It's just getting started.

00:30:24.780 --> 00:30:26.909
&gt;&gt;Martha Stewart: From almost day one.

00:30:26.909 --> 00:30:28.039
I find it repetitive.

00:30:28.039 --> 00:30:29.039
&gt;&gt;Marissa Mayer: Really?

00:30:29.039 --> 00:30:32.070
&gt;&gt;Martha Stewart: I don't know why, but I
do.

00:30:32.070 --> 00:30:33.070
&gt;&gt;Marissa Mayer: Okay.

00:30:33.070 --> 00:30:37.059
So how -- we'll try and make it less repetitive.

00:30:37.059 --> 00:30:42.040
&gt;&gt;Martha Stewart: I love --
&gt;&gt;Marissa Mayer: How best do you -- Is there

00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:44.679
a particular way that you really like to engage
with your fans online?

00:30:44.679 --> 00:30:46.140
Is it the Pinterest boards?

00:30:46.140 --> 00:30:47.140
Twitter?

00:30:47.140 --> 00:30:50.070
&gt;&gt;Martha Stewart: Well, Pinterest is very
visual.

00:30:50.070 --> 00:30:56.490
On Twitter, I do both twit pics as well as
tweets.

00:30:56.490 --> 00:30:57.490
And that works very well.

00:30:57.490 --> 00:31:01.800
I have almost two and a half million followers
who are pretty active.

00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:04.650
I love to do instant surveys.

00:31:04.650 --> 00:31:10.150
So if I'm meeting with a new potential business
partner, and we did this not long ago with

00:31:10.150 --> 00:31:15.470
a retailer that I wanted to carry our cleaning
products, I said -- I just tweeted while I

00:31:15.470 --> 00:31:21.289
was sitting with the CEO, I tweeted, "Would
you buy my cleaning products at such and such

00:31:21.289 --> 00:31:22.600
a retail outlet?"

00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:28.929
I got back, oh, several hundred tweets within
three minutes saying exactly, well, there's

00:31:28.929 --> 00:31:33.610
-- that store doesn't -- isn't near me, I
can't buy it there because I -- it's too far

00:31:33.610 --> 00:31:38.010
away from my home or -- but instantaneous
results.

00:31:38.010 --> 00:31:40.270
I love it for that.

00:31:40.270 --> 00:31:44.390
And I also love it for instant news, because
it really does keep you informed.

00:31:44.390 --> 00:31:49.960
Facebook is a fantastic way for us to communicate.

00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:53.270
And I just can't wait to really get into our
Google+.

00:31:53.270 --> 00:31:55.820
&gt;&gt;Marissa Mayer: So Martha's on Google+.

00:31:55.820 --> 00:31:58.370
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Marissa Mayer: Martha's on Google+.

00:31:58.370 --> 00:32:00.060
&gt;&gt;Martha Stewart: We are.

00:32:00.060 --> 00:32:03.789
&gt;&gt;Marissa Mayer: And in fact Eugenia, in fact,
had a question, she said we would really love

00:32:03.789 --> 00:32:05.630
to see you do a Google+ Hangout.

00:32:05.630 --> 00:32:11.571
You can do a Hangout where you broadcast with
all of your fans we'd love to see you do some

00:32:11.571 --> 00:32:12.571
crafts and cooking.

00:32:12.571 --> 00:32:14.720
&gt;&gt;Martha Stewart: We will do that, absolutely.

00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:18.370
&gt;&gt;Marissa Mayer: Judy Chang asks, you publish
your calendar online.

00:32:18.370 --> 00:32:23.230
It's full of activities, from your book tour
to TV appearances, mulching your garden, polishing

00:32:23.230 --> 00:32:24.810
your silverware.

00:32:24.810 --> 00:32:27.280
How many people work on your household staff?

00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:29.590
And how much do you sleep each night?

00:32:29.590 --> 00:32:33.250
&gt;&gt;Martha Stewart: Oh, the sleeping's sort
of like crazy.

00:32:33.250 --> 00:32:36.640
And it depends what I'm thinking about and
doing.

00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:41.710
But in terms of household staff, I have three
houses, and they're all open all the time.

00:32:41.710 --> 00:32:44.830
So I want to be able to -- they're used as
laboratories.

00:32:44.830 --> 00:32:50.440
So I want to be able to go there, and they're
clean and dust-free and ready for pictures.

00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:57.970
So anywhere from two in a house to more, depending
on what we really need to do.

00:32:57.970 --> 00:33:02.660
It's -- staffing is always a challenge.

00:33:02.660 --> 00:33:07.390
And keeping good staff -- One of my housekeepers
has been with me for 30 years.

00:33:07.390 --> 00:33:10.090
One has been with me for 27 years.

00:33:10.090 --> 00:33:13.040
They're -- and they really know where everything
is.

00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:14.429
And I have a lot of stuff.

00:33:14.429 --> 00:33:19.390
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Marissa Mayer: How much of a role does search

00:33:19.390 --> 00:33:21.300
play in your day-to-day?

00:33:21.300 --> 00:33:22.700
What do you search for?

00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:28.880
&gt;&gt;Martha Stewart: Oh, it's a very important
part of my day, because I do a lot of writing,

00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:33.950
and I oftentimes have to find out something
about something.

00:33:33.950 --> 00:33:36.929
So I will use it for my research.

00:33:36.929 --> 00:33:41.880
It's much, much quicker than going to the
local library or to -- down the road from

00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:42.880
my house.

00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:44.179
I can't do that.

00:33:44.179 --> 00:33:48.770
And so it's a tremendously wonderful timesaver.

00:33:48.770 --> 00:33:52.080
But that said, I use it for lots of other
things, too.

00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:53.450
Shopping, of course.

00:33:53.450 --> 00:33:56.330
Comparison shopping, of course.

00:33:56.330 --> 00:33:57.970
For the research.

00:33:57.970 --> 00:34:05.650
For information, like maps, very important
to me to know where I'm going and how I'm

00:34:05.650 --> 00:34:07.060
getting there.

00:34:07.060 --> 00:34:08.929
So I use it for a lot of things.

00:34:08.929 --> 00:34:10.349
&gt;&gt;Marissa Mayer: And we're working on more.

00:34:10.349 --> 00:34:16.040
I know that, actually, when I met you in your
studio, there was in amazing ceramic bowl

00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:18.419
that was just very organic.

00:34:18.419 --> 00:34:20.000
&gt;&gt;Martha Stewart: The German bowl.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:23.140
&gt;&gt;Marissa Mayer: And Martha said, okay, when
are you going to have a search technology

00:34:23.140 --> 00:34:26.730
that's going to help me figure out where this
bowl came from and where I can get more of

00:34:26.730 --> 00:34:27.730
it?

00:34:27.730 --> 00:34:28.730
We're working on it.

00:34:28.730 --> 00:34:29.810
We don't have Visual Search quite that good,
but we're working.

00:34:29.810 --> 00:34:35.600
&gt;&gt;Martha Stewart: If it doesn't have a bar
code or it's not a well-known object, to be

00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:41.230
able to photograph it and find it in a -- in
somebody's catalogue, that is happening.

00:34:41.230 --> 00:34:43.580
I know it's happening more and more every
single day.

00:34:43.580 --> 00:34:48.550
&gt;&gt;Marissa Mayer: Today, we have Google Goggles
which can recognize landmarks and can recognize

00:34:48.550 --> 00:34:49.550
products.

00:34:49.550 --> 00:34:50.550
But we are working on that visual recognition.

00:34:50.550 --> 00:34:52.860
I'll ask Martha one more question and then
we'll open up to audience questions.

00:34:52.860 --> 00:34:57.910
So if you want to move to microphones if you
have a question, we'll open it up in a just

00:34:57.910 --> 00:34:58.910
a second.

00:34:58.910 --> 00:34:59.950
But my next question is about YouTube.

00:34:59.950 --> 00:35:01.670
So we talked a little bit about search.

00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:07.170
You're really active on YouTube, lots of amazing
clips that can teach people how to do crafts

00:35:07.170 --> 00:35:08.290
and cooking.

00:35:08.290 --> 00:35:09.770
How do you decide what goes on YouTube?

00:35:09.770 --> 00:35:12.960
How do you know what your users really want
to see?

00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:16.550
&gt;&gt;Martha Stewart: Well, we're all experimenting.

00:35:16.550 --> 00:35:20.930
And during holiday times, they want to know
how to do turkey 101.

00:35:20.930 --> 00:35:23.010
They want to know how to make a croquembouche.

00:35:23.010 --> 00:35:25.600
They want to know how to fold a fitted sheet.

00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:27.950
They want to know how to fold a tee shirt.

00:35:27.950 --> 00:35:34.450
I mean, it's amazing how many different things
people really need and want.

00:35:34.450 --> 00:35:35.460
And we try to keep up with that.

00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:36.460
&gt;&gt;Marissa Mayer: That's cool.

00:35:36.460 --> 00:35:37.460
Okay.

00:35:37.460 --> 00:35:38.630
Let's go ahead and go to the audience here.

00:35:38.630 --> 00:35:39.630
&gt;&gt;Martha Stewart: Hi.

00:35:39.630 --> 00:35:40.630
&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi.

00:35:40.630 --> 00:35:41.630
Thanks for being here, Martha.

00:35:41.630 --> 00:35:43.490
It's great to hear from you.

00:35:43.490 --> 00:35:46.109
You've grown your business into a complete
lifestyle empire.

00:35:46.109 --> 00:35:48.060
But how do you keep challenging yourself?

00:35:48.060 --> 00:35:50.690
What would you like to accomplish the next
five to ten years?

00:35:50.690 --> 00:35:55.890
&gt;&gt;Martha Stewart: Well, in the next five to
ten years, I would like to work with some

00:35:55.890 --> 00:36:01.540
of the more -- more impressively progressive
people that I have met.

00:36:01.540 --> 00:36:06.080
I would like to develop new ways of thinking
about things.

00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:09.900
I would like to build my store, which I haven't
built yet.

00:36:09.900 --> 00:36:12.329
And so there's a lot of things to do.

00:36:12.329 --> 00:36:13.329
&gt;&gt;&gt; Great.

00:36:13.329 --> 00:36:14.329
Thank you.

00:36:14.329 --> 00:36:15.930
&gt;&gt;Marissa Mayer: Yes, go ahead.

00:36:15.930 --> 00:36:18.980
&gt;&gt;&gt; This is definitely not as serious of a
question.

00:36:18.980 --> 00:36:19.980
It's sort of silly.

00:36:19.980 --> 00:36:23.310
But how do you fold a fitted sheet?

00:36:23.310 --> 00:36:26.922
&gt;&gt;Martha Stewart: Corner by corner by corner.

00:36:26.922 --> 00:36:31.730
Your hands -- and there's a certain way which
corner to take, one, two, three, four, and

00:36:31.730 --> 00:36:33.470
it does fold quite nicely.

00:36:33.470 --> 00:36:35.560
Not perfectly, but very nicely.

00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:37.450
And it will fit in your linen closet.

00:36:37.450 --> 00:36:42.849
But my suggestion to all busy people, do your
laundry, dry the sheet, put it back on the

00:36:42.849 --> 00:36:43.849
bed.

00:36:43.849 --> 00:36:45.400
[ Laughter ]
[ Applause ]

00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:48.800
&gt;&gt;Marissa Mayer: Practical advice.

00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:53.049
&gt;&gt;Martha Stewart: And not every three weeks,
by the way.

00:36:53.049 --> 00:36:56.410
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Martha Stewart: I took a survey on Twitter

00:36:56.410 --> 00:36:59.490
and asked them how often they change their
beds.

00:36:59.490 --> 00:37:00.490
I was horrified.

00:37:00.490 --> 00:37:01.490
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Martha Stewart: Horrified.

00:37:01.490 --> 00:37:06.290
I mean, really, the average was two weeks.

00:37:06.290 --> 00:37:07.340
That's really bad.

00:37:07.340 --> 00:37:09.830
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Marissa Mayer: Well, you have to worry about

00:37:09.830 --> 00:37:16.569
these people who are online all the time taking
all the surveys, I guess.

00:37:16.569 --> 00:37:19.830
&gt;&gt;&gt; So you have created so many recipes, maybe
thousands.

00:37:19.830 --> 00:37:24.339
How did you manage to stay fit at the same
time?

00:37:24.339 --> 00:37:25.930
&gt;&gt;Martha Stewart: Stay what?

00:37:25.930 --> 00:37:26.930
&gt;&gt;&gt; Fit.

00:37:26.930 --> 00:37:27.930
&gt;&gt;Marissa Mayer: Physically fit.

00:37:27.930 --> 00:37:29.510
&gt;&gt;Martha Stewart: Oh, fit.

00:37:29.510 --> 00:37:30.700
Oh, my God.

00:37:30.700 --> 00:37:33.720
Well, it's hard, because I eat a lot.

00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:34.970
I have to taste a lot.

00:37:34.970 --> 00:37:42.490
I'll get off a show, and then -- and my test
kitchen at TV, they'll have 44 different croissants

00:37:42.490 --> 00:37:44.790
for me to taste to choose the best croissant.

00:37:44.790 --> 00:37:46.180
It's really hard.

00:37:46.180 --> 00:37:49.420
But -- and it's interesting.

00:37:49.420 --> 00:37:50.990
But it's also difficult.

00:37:50.990 --> 00:37:53.070
And I exercise a lot.

00:37:53.070 --> 00:37:55.730
I'm not a maniac, but I exercise a lot.

00:37:55.730 --> 00:37:56.730
I eat really well.

00:37:56.730 --> 00:37:57.980
I eat from my own organic garden.

00:37:57.980 --> 00:37:59.480
I'm going to see your garden here.

00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:00.760
&gt;&gt;Marissa Mayer: Yes.

00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:03.060
&gt;&gt;Martha Stewart: I want to see it.

00:38:03.060 --> 00:38:06.660
I grow pretty much all my food on my own farm.

00:38:06.660 --> 00:38:11.700
&gt;&gt;&gt; Is there any natural limitations of number
of recipes in the world?

00:38:11.700 --> 00:38:13.390
&gt;&gt;Martha Stewart: I don't think so.

00:38:13.390 --> 00:38:20.690
I think -- I think recipes are -- can be altered
by a teaspoon of this or a tablespoon of that.

00:38:20.690 --> 00:38:26.940
And I think we have created original recipes
in our company, oh, many, many thousands of

00:38:26.940 --> 00:38:33.500
recipes, and they're in many of the 75 books
that we've created and all those magazines.

00:38:33.500 --> 00:38:36.499
And we're -- we have a good Recipe Search
on our site.

00:38:36.499 --> 00:38:37.499
&gt;&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:38:37.499 --> 00:38:38.499
Thank you.

00:38:38.499 --> 00:38:39.660
&gt;&gt;Marissa Mayer: Let's go here.

00:38:39.660 --> 00:38:41.640
&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks again for coming, Martha.

00:38:41.640 --> 00:38:43.490
This is awesome.

00:38:43.490 --> 00:38:49.170
I'm curious, you're surrounded by gourmet
organic food, and for everyone to sort of

00:38:49.170 --> 00:38:51.160
look to you as an example in all of this.

00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:55.910
Are there times when you just want to close
the door and splurge and eat, like, a TV dinner?

00:38:55.910 --> 00:39:00.580
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Martha Stewart: I haven't found a TV dinner

00:39:00.580 --> 00:39:04.190
that is that enticing yet.

00:39:04.190 --> 00:39:08.460
And I have tasted a lot, just to see what's
really out there and what people are putting

00:39:08.460 --> 00:39:09.609
in their children's stomachs.

00:39:09.609 --> 00:39:11.920
And it's pretty depressing.

00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:14.690
We're working on food now.

00:39:14.690 --> 00:39:21.420
And it's very interesting to see who is doing
good prepared foods for the marketplace, good

00:39:21.420 --> 00:39:23.260
ingredients for the marketplace.

00:39:23.260 --> 00:39:29.349
I am a very, very staunch supporter of nonfactory
farming.

00:39:29.349 --> 00:39:33.140
I hate what's going on in the factory farms
in America.

00:39:33.140 --> 00:39:40.240
And I cannot -- I cannot abide the cruelty
to the animals that were being fed -- the

00:39:40.240 --> 00:39:45.500
way grains are being grown, that you will
gluten-intolerance that's going on, it's a

00:39:45.500 --> 00:39:51.860
very serious problem, and why, why, when I
was growing up, nobody was allergic to wheat.

00:39:51.860 --> 00:39:56.530
I didn't know one person, I didn't know one
person with a peanut allergy.

00:39:56.530 --> 00:39:58.880
I didn't -- and I don't think it's the peanuts.

00:39:58.880 --> 00:40:00.540
And I don't think it's the wheat.

00:40:00.540 --> 00:40:05.590
I really think it's what's -- the processing;
I think it's the way it's being grown; I think

00:40:05.590 --> 00:40:09.780
it's the way it's being sprayed, fertilized,
all of that.

00:40:09.780 --> 00:40:14.400
And we have to really, really, as a country,
pay attention to that.

00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:15.839
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks.

00:40:15.839 --> 00:40:17.990
&gt;&gt;Martha Stewart: Okay?

00:40:17.990 --> 00:40:21.579
&gt;&gt;Marissa Mayer: It is true.

00:40:21.579 --> 00:40:25.710
My two closest friends have a gluten allergy.

00:40:25.710 --> 00:40:26.770
&gt;&gt;Martha Stewart: It's crazy.

00:40:26.770 --> 00:40:28.060
&gt;&gt;Marissa Mayer: So of the three of us, two
of them have gluten allergies.

00:40:28.060 --> 00:40:29.060
&gt;&gt;&gt; Hello, Martha.

00:40:29.060 --> 00:40:30.060
Thank you for being here.

00:40:30.060 --> 00:40:31.700
I have, actually, a business-related question.

00:40:31.700 --> 00:40:38.070
As a leader of an organization, how do you
continue to have all of your staff meet the

00:40:38.070 --> 00:40:44.230
same level of excellence and continue to innovate
year over year in the areas of creative design,

00:40:44.230 --> 00:40:45.230
et cetera?

00:40:45.230 --> 00:40:49.760
&gt;&gt;Martha Stewart: Well, you try to hire in
the first place people who have the same DNAs

00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:51.700
you have.

00:40:51.700 --> 00:40:58.230
You want them to be interested in the core
content areas of your particular kind of organization.

00:40:58.230 --> 00:41:01.609
And we were very, very, very good at that.

00:41:01.609 --> 00:41:07.270
As an organization grows, that can get away
from you, and you can be less choosey or less

00:41:07.270 --> 00:41:13.000
fussy or maybe there's not as many talented
people in those specific areas as there used

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:16.260
to be, because there's more competition.

00:41:16.260 --> 00:41:20.910
It's an ongoing, challenging problem for any
company.

00:41:20.910 --> 00:41:26.960
And you just have to have a very good HR department
and one who is looking, and a good search

00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:32.130
department, human resources, to find the right
people for your particular company.

00:41:32.130 --> 00:41:35.730
You know, sometimes I'll see people, and I
think, "God, what are they doing here?"

00:41:35.730 --> 00:41:36.890
Not physically.

00:41:36.890 --> 00:41:37.920
I don't mean physically.

00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:39.599
But when I see what they create.

00:41:39.599 --> 00:41:41.940
What the heck are they doing in this environment?

00:41:41.940 --> 00:41:44.730
They just don't have it.

00:41:44.730 --> 00:41:47.559
And you have to really be very, very careful
about that.

00:41:47.559 --> 00:41:48.559
&gt;&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:41:48.559 --> 00:41:52.140
&gt;&gt;Marissa Mayer: Hiring is something here
at Google that we take really seriously, too.

00:41:52.140 --> 00:41:53.140
&gt;&gt;Martha Stewart: I know.

00:41:53.140 --> 00:41:54.140
I know.

00:41:54.140 --> 00:41:55.140
&gt;&gt;Marissa Mayer: Yes.

00:41:55.140 --> 00:41:57.810
&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi, you've inspired me so much to create
in my own home.

00:41:57.810 --> 00:42:00.089
Before I discovered you, I couldn't bake a
potato.

00:42:00.089 --> 00:42:02.340
And now I'm bringing pies to all the holiday
events.

00:42:02.340 --> 00:42:03.680
&gt;&gt;Martha Stewart: Oh, good.

00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:04.680
&gt;&gt;&gt; It's awesome.

00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:08.580
I know you have a small corner on your Web
site and your magazine dedicated to kids.

00:42:08.580 --> 00:42:12.640
I was wonder if you were thinking about expanding
that to get our kids to create more.

00:42:12.640 --> 00:42:18.010
&gt;&gt;Martha Stewart: We had a wonderful baby
magazine and a wonderful kids' magazine about

00:42:18.010 --> 00:42:20.640
eight or nine years ago.

00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:24.380
It was a fantastic publication.

00:42:24.380 --> 00:42:25.910
I want to bring that back.

00:42:25.910 --> 00:42:31.740
And the reason that we stopped publishing
it was lack of advertising.

00:42:31.740 --> 00:42:36.930
There's not very many magazines devoted to
the raising of children, to the teaching of

00:42:36.930 --> 00:42:37.930
kids.

00:42:37.930 --> 00:42:43.599
And I think the Internet is a more appropriate
place, actually, for that information.

00:42:43.599 --> 00:42:48.330
And we are working on plans to re-enliven
or enliven that area.

00:42:48.330 --> 00:42:49.330
&gt;&gt;&gt; Great.

00:42:49.330 --> 00:42:52.910
&gt;&gt;Martha Stewart: So watch for it.

00:42:52.910 --> 00:42:53.910
&gt;&gt;&gt; I will.

00:42:53.910 --> 00:42:54.910
&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi.

00:42:54.910 --> 00:42:56.020
Obviously, you've had a very successful business
career to date.

00:42:56.020 --> 00:43:00.789
In looking back over everything related to
your company, what is the one decision that

00:43:00.789 --> 00:43:04.550
-- in retrospect, you wouldn't have made,
knowing what you know now?

00:43:04.550 --> 00:43:12.430
&gt;&gt;Martha Stewart: Well, I had one horrible
stumbling, which was a stock sale unrelated

00:43:12.430 --> 00:43:15.230
to the company, unrelated to anything.

00:43:15.230 --> 00:43:20.020
I was on a -- I mean, I can go through the
whole litany of the disaster.

00:43:20.020 --> 00:43:25.360
I would avoid disasters -- legal problems
like that forever.

00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:31.430
Because -- yeah, because that sets you back
terribly.

00:43:31.430 --> 00:43:34.780
And it could have destroyed my company.

00:43:34.780 --> 00:43:38.020
But the customers never left.

00:43:38.020 --> 00:43:42.520
Advertisers did take -- go to the sidelines
for a while.

00:43:42.520 --> 00:43:50.820
It's -- and rebuilding something that's beautiful
and useful and good is a lot harder than building

00:43:50.820 --> 00:43:51.820
it.

00:43:51.820 --> 00:43:56.420
So the rebuilding process is painful, for
me, because, like, I never go the same route

00:43:56.420 --> 00:43:59.900
to the same place ever, if I can -- if I can
avoid it.

00:43:59.900 --> 00:44:04.589
You know, if there's a straight line, I will
go circuitously so I might see something new.

00:44:04.589 --> 00:44:07.599
Because my motto is see something, learn something
new every day.

00:44:07.599 --> 00:44:14.900
So avoiding -- avoiding, with the help of
maybe, you know, really the best advisors

00:44:14.900 --> 00:44:20.559
or something, just avoid -- if you can, avoid
a disaster.

00:44:20.559 --> 00:44:24.740
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Martha Stewart: And if you fall into that

00:44:24.740 --> 00:44:31.180
-- into that crevasse, get out of it in the
fastest, best, cleanest way possible.

00:44:31.180 --> 00:44:32.180
&gt;&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:44:32.180 --> 00:44:33.180
Thank you.

00:44:33.180 --> 00:44:35.810
&gt;&gt;Martha Stewart: So --
&gt;&gt;Marissa Mayer: And let's take two more questions.

00:44:35.810 --> 00:44:36.810
&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi, Martha.

00:44:36.810 --> 00:44:38.690
It's good to have you at Google.

00:44:38.690 --> 00:44:44.470
So I don't actually quite enjoy cooking, but
I think it's because I don't know how to cook.

00:44:44.470 --> 00:44:47.160
So my question is, how do you keep it fun
in the kitchen?

00:44:47.160 --> 00:44:49.220
What's your advice for someone like me?

00:44:49.220 --> 00:44:53.200
&gt;&gt;Martha Stewart: Well, I think you should
take some great cooking lessons if you don't

00:44:53.200 --> 00:44:55.750
really know how to cook.

00:44:55.750 --> 00:44:58.700
And it's hard to teach yourself how to cook.

00:44:58.700 --> 00:45:01.180
I watch people.

00:45:01.180 --> 00:45:07.700
And I like to sit, like, at a sushi bar, and
I sat watching Nobu himself doing sushi for

00:45:07.700 --> 00:45:10.359
a long time, eating there quite often.

00:45:10.359 --> 00:45:12.571
And he finally let me cut sushi with him.

00:45:12.571 --> 00:45:17.030
And he gave me a sushi chef's coat, which
I'm very proud of, because very few people

00:45:17.030 --> 00:45:21.240
get a Nobu Sushi coat.

00:45:21.240 --> 00:45:22.240
So I watch.

00:45:22.240 --> 00:45:26.310
And I learn by -- and I learn by emulating
the very, very best.

00:45:26.310 --> 00:45:30.880
I'm lucky in my job, because I can invite
any chef on my show and learn from him.

00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:32.950
We had Thomas Keller on the other day.

00:45:32.950 --> 00:45:40.160
The way he uses his hands and the way his
-- the precise nature of his cooking is so,

00:45:40.160 --> 00:45:42.480
so interesting.

00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:46.260
And so you should -- if you're interested
in eating, you should be interested in how

00:45:46.260 --> 00:45:47.880
that food is made.

00:45:47.880 --> 00:45:49.569
And then it might induce you to learn.

00:45:49.569 --> 00:45:50.569
&gt;&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:45:50.569 --> 00:45:51.829
&gt;&gt;Marissa Mayer: Yep.

00:45:51.829 --> 00:45:52.829
&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi, Martha.

00:45:52.829 --> 00:45:54.680
Thank you for being here.

00:45:54.680 --> 00:45:55.740
I have one question.

00:45:55.740 --> 00:45:57.020
You're very successful.

00:45:57.020 --> 00:46:02.010
I would like to ask, I'm sure you had some
difficult times.

00:46:02.010 --> 00:46:06.690
How did you put yourself together again in
those difficult times and just kept on going?

00:46:06.690 --> 00:46:09.400
&gt;&gt;Martha Stewart: Well, I'm very strong.

00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:16.440
I have good, solid family genes behind me
of longevity and strength.

00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:19.910
And when you know that you are okay, you're
okay.

00:46:19.910 --> 00:46:23.510
You have to just keep telling yourself.

00:46:23.510 --> 00:46:31.720
And it's really about not so much self-preservation
as knowing that what you're doing is useful

00:46:31.720 --> 00:46:36.930
and good and profitable and interesting.

00:46:36.930 --> 00:46:39.430
That's -- it's a simple little formula.

00:46:39.430 --> 00:46:40.430
&gt;&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:46:40.430 --> 00:46:41.430
&gt;&gt;Marissa Mayer: Okay.

00:46:41.430 --> 00:46:43.280
Well, there's one question I always like to
ask.

00:46:43.280 --> 00:46:44.510
&gt;&gt;Martha Stewart: Yes.

00:46:44.510 --> 00:46:49.480
&gt;&gt;Marissa Mayer: Which is, what is the best
piece of advice you've ever received?

00:46:49.480 --> 00:46:54.400
The one that stands out in your mind, like,
oh, somehow I've carried that with me, or

00:46:54.400 --> 00:46:56.290
it was just a really critical moment.

00:46:56.290 --> 00:47:02.060
&gt;&gt;Martha Stewart: Well, my dad, when I was
about 16, I think, applying to college, I

00:47:02.060 --> 00:47:07.130
sat there and said, "You know, dad, where
should I go?"

00:47:07.130 --> 00:47:11.320
And he said, "You know, Martha, you're a smart
girl.

00:47:11.320 --> 00:47:17.200
You can do pretty much anything you want,
and you make up your mind."

00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:22.099
And that was -- when he said, "You can do
anything you want," I think that that kind

00:47:22.099 --> 00:47:25.400
of encouragement is invaluable for life.

00:47:25.400 --> 00:47:28.609
&gt;&gt;Marissa Mayer: Let's talk a little bit about
the future.

00:47:28.609 --> 00:47:29.609
&gt;&gt;Martha Stewart: Oh.

00:47:29.609 --> 00:47:32.130
&gt;&gt;Marissa Mayer: Where do you think the do-it-yourself
industry is going?

00:47:32.130 --> 00:47:34.589
Where does it go in the future, in five years,
in ten years?

00:47:34.589 --> 00:47:36.599
How does it change shape?

00:47:36.599 --> 00:47:42.651
&gt;&gt;Martha Stewart: One reason I'm on a book
tour right now is because you think, after

00:47:42.651 --> 00:47:48.540
so many books, do you get -- I get to see
people face to face.

00:47:48.540 --> 00:47:56.210
And last night, at Macy's in Costa Mesa, south
of -- I guess that's south of L.A. -- there

00:47:56.210 --> 00:48:00.250
were so many young people in line, young mothers
with babies.

00:48:00.250 --> 00:48:01.390
So many babies came.

00:48:01.390 --> 00:48:03.849
And this is at 7:00 o'clock at night.

00:48:03.849 --> 00:48:05.010
The babies were there.

00:48:05.010 --> 00:48:06.230
The young mothers were there.

00:48:06.230 --> 00:48:08.060
Their husbands were there.

00:48:08.060 --> 00:48:14.550
I can see that the craving for good, solid
how-to information is alive and well.

00:48:14.550 --> 00:48:19.480
And I think that that's why the kind of work
that I do and our company does in terms of

00:48:19.480 --> 00:48:24.490
teaching and inspiring is very important.

00:48:24.490 --> 00:48:32.369
And if you forget how to learn, even the homeliest
chores, you're not going to -- you can't live.

00:48:32.369 --> 00:48:34.940
You can't.

00:48:34.940 --> 00:48:37.109
And it's -- you know, we're not all billionaires.

00:48:37.109 --> 00:48:39.670
We're not all millionaires.

00:48:39.670 --> 00:48:42.130
We all have challenges in life.

00:48:42.130 --> 00:48:48.130
But knowing how to do things so things can
be done well, I think, is very important for

00:48:48.130 --> 00:48:49.500
the rest of your life.

00:48:49.500 --> 00:48:53.560
&gt;&gt;Marissa Mayer: And on that note, today,
the book is about entertaining, entertaining

00:48:53.560 --> 00:48:54.580
and entertaining well.

00:48:54.580 --> 00:48:55.580
&gt;&gt;Martha Stewart: Yes.

00:48:55.580 --> 00:48:59.430
&gt;&gt;Marissa Mayer: We actually have books for
the first two rows.

00:48:59.430 --> 00:49:05.069
If you reach underneath your seat, there's
a card underneath, and you get a voucher for

00:49:05.069 --> 00:49:07.540
today's book.

00:49:07.540 --> 00:49:08.540
Martha's book.

00:49:08.540 --> 00:49:09.869
We're going to have a book-signing.

00:49:09.869 --> 00:49:13.349
It's going to be in Seville tech talk from
noon to 1:00.

00:49:13.349 --> 00:49:15.270
So Martha will be there, signing books.

00:49:15.270 --> 00:49:16.990
You can also buy the book there.

00:49:16.990 --> 00:49:18.599
So you can buy the book and have Martha sign
it.

00:49:18.599 --> 00:49:21.700
Get a chance to meet her.

00:49:21.700 --> 00:49:26.220
For the next hour, we're all going to go and
show you some of what we're up to here at

00:49:26.220 --> 00:49:29.120
Google and how we get things done here.

00:49:29.120 --> 00:49:30.839
But this has just been so wonderful.

00:49:30.839 --> 00:49:32.900
It's such an honor to have you here.

00:49:32.900 --> 00:49:34.370
And you've been so wonderful this morning.

00:49:34.370 --> 00:49:35.790
Let's give Martha a really warm round of applause.

00:49:35.790 --> 00:49:36.790
&gt;&gt;Martha Stewart: Thank you.

00:49:36.790 --> 00:49:36.791
