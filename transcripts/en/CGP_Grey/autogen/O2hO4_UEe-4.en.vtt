00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:00.630
 # This video will hurt # 

00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:04.610
 Wear your headphones Please, I promise you that there are no loud sounds but this 

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:09.469
 The video will hurt you. There is a study on ultrasound and how to cause headaches 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:13.969
 These are more audible than those added to this video 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:16.710
 But it causes a headache anyway, 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.950
 The ultrasonic wave in your headphones presses on your inner ear, pressing on the connecting nerves 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:25.880
 For your mind where the headache does not start yet, it will start shortly after exposure to the waves 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.700
 It causes headaches 10 seconds later 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:29.630
 .Oh my God 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.399
 Feel it? That pressure on your ears is spread to your beaver's mind? 

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:33.890
 because you are 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:38.120
 You are not supposed to feel it: that study is artificial and there is no ultrasound in this video 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.480
 However, some of you started feeling headaches. Why? Because of the influence of Nosebo 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.600
 Nusibu is harmless, such as video tags above fake audios, and causes the hurt 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:51.149
 Like a headache, because you think it hurts. This may seem juggling though 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.539
 There are scientific studies on the influence of Nosibu as it is more than a play trick 

00:00:55.539 --> 00:00:58.319
 It causes real medical problems 

00:00:58.319 --> 00:01:02.109
 When a new drug is tested, doctors get a group of patients and give half of them the new drug 

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:06.780
 While giving the other half a disc that does not have. Effect but tell them that it is a real medicine 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.600
 Thus scientists discover what works from the nonsense that does not harm or benefit 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.500
 However, modern properties have side effects and sometimes patients leave the study because of them 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.610
 No surprise here 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:21.070
 But also withdraw some people who take counterfeit real estate because of the side effects 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.340
 Of a drug they do not take but because they believe they are taking it 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.250
 They also believed they had side effects 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.880
 Perhaps this is just a case of misinterpretation: people often get headaches and join a medical study 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.740
 Remember that headache is a possible side effect. It is normal to link the headache to the new drug 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.320
 This happens, of course 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:43.390
 But the effect of Nosibu more than a misinterpretation is causing additional real damage and scientists can 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.110
 Measured in very harsh experiments and this cruelty is one of the reasons for the lack of abundance 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.960
 Of research on harmful phantom drugs as they progressed to the Board of Ethical Review of Research 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.370
 With research designed specifically for human beings would reject it. But Nusibu tests are sometimes believed 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:00.880
 For the benefit of science and humanity, but not for the benefit of the participants 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.320
 For example, under the right conditions when some people expect to get rashes 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.479
 My skin from a syringe with harmful effects will get swollen but when they expect nothing to happen, no 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.380
 Something happens completely 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:14.470
 Cereals may become addicted, if participants are cut off on a pill they think is addicted 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.980
 Some will experience symptoms of a mock withdrawal such as pain and exhaustion 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.450
 Grains are impossible to add to the original 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.060
 In another test I gave some people a harmless right and half of them were not told anything while it was said 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.310
 The other half that the pain will intensify in the next half hour which has already happened 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.200
 But in this test there was a drug that inhibited the effect of Nosebo and those 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:39.050
 Who were told that the injection would hurt them and secretly gave the drug to the nussibu 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:43.870
 Did not report an increase in pain, showing that the Nosebo effect was a physical process 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:44.610
 Genuine 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.819
 In all Nusseibu tests, the conviction that the hurt is what distinguishes. If you meet a magician 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:53.060
 A sorcerer and curse this magician with the curse of pain, nothing will happen to you 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.069
 But if you are with a doctor and his prescription, a medical machine and an injection 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:00.480
 In your arm, you will take his words seriously 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.830
 That's why doctors say "this will not hurt you" rather than "this will hurt you 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:09.670
 Strongly "(by the way this was a test for women passing by 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.580
 (Birth defects during spinal injection, you can imagine how this was done 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:18.140
 But the effect of Nosibu is not only that, while diseases such as influenza spread from communication with humans 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:22.920
 Infected with delinquents and touched by their nasty and spread hands, Nosebo spreads 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.920
 From the mind to the other mind without any connection 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.040
 A noteworthy example is what happened at a high school in Tennessee when I was informed of the Eshmat school 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:34.599
 Strange smell in the separation and then began to show symptoms of headache and nausea and difficulty breathing 

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:39.180
 These symptoms spread to their students and to other students at school and ended 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:44.220
 Visited about 200 people to the local hospital but the medical tests did not report anything, 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.819
 I found nothing harmful about school 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:52.599
 This was Nusibu, the belief that the air was sick and moved from one mind to another 

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:57.379
 And each of the disease had heard about the symptoms of another. When this happens he calls 

00:03:57.379 --> 00:03:59.599
 Collective disease resulting from the mind 

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:03.750
 Treatment in these cases is the isolation of those suffering from these symptoms from the rest and reassure them 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:08.230
 That their symptoms are real but they have not been exposed to anything toxic 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:10.860
 And that people's situation is improving rapidly 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:15.680
 This is the last indication of the evidence that separates a toxic gas leak or a biological weapon 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:20.040
 Of the collective disease resulting from the mind, but the last factor is to increase the number of cases by increasing coverage of the news 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:24.199
 These symptoms are very common 

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:28.630
 If, for example, people with electromagnetic susceptibility are those who feel nausea (and other symptoms) from exposure to some 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:34.040
 Electromagnetic waves, especially wavelengths, which are increasingly used over time 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:38.800
 Which makes some of those suffering from those symptoms strongly to retire to places with scary names such as the silence 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.380
 (Radio in West Virginia) of course 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:45.750
 However, if the electromagnetic susceptibility is placed in a room with it and it will not be able to know through 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:51.030
 Their symptoms are if they are closed or open, but rather, they follow their symptoms if they are told 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:52.180
 It is open or closed 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:55.690
 Some people who do not suffer from electromagnetic susceptibility are forced to watch a news report 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:05:00.100
 That Waiwai is sick while the other group see something non-educational and then 

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:04.630
 The two groups were shown on fake waves and some would only see those who watched the news report 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:05.699
 The disease 

00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:09.169
 There is a similar phenomenon claiming wind farm disease and have similar symptoms 

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:13.430
 Appear only where local news agencies are talking, not below 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:16.520
 In the same country with the same wind farms 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:20.290
 All of this makes it easy to mock those who think they get sick from the wifi 

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:25.380
 Or wind farms or wind farms by Yvai but it is necessary to realize that they are not crazy 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:30.020
 Their symptoms are real but they are wrong about the source of these symptoms as all evidence suggests that 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:34.350
 Electromagnetic susceptibility is the reason 

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:38.100
 Which means that news reports about these diseases are somehow published 

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:42.570
 While these are anomalous examples, there is also evidence that some allergies 

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:47.030
 And asthma caused by Nosebo and thus spread in the same way 

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:50.830
 For clarity: If you see someone getting an asthma attack this is not a good time to tell them that you are 

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:55.310
 You think they are hysterics because you saw a video on the internet about the effect of Nosebo 

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:59.440
 They really have asthma and really need something to stop 

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:03.259
 This is really not to boast of your knowledge 

00:06:03.259 --> 00:06:07.290
 Harmful things are not harmful just because we think they are harmful as an adequate dose of arsenic 

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:11.880
 It will kill you just as it will kill you with an anvil on your head, no matter what you insist on 

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:16.449
 But Nussibu's influence shows us that our beliefs about things are not harmful 

00:06:16.449 --> 00:06:17.240
 It makes them harmful 

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:21.180
 Which means that the curse of the witch doctor we mentioned before can actually hurt us but that 

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:22.689
 We are humpy enough to believe it
