00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:01.099
Driven.

00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:02.000
Curious.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.780
Persistent.

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:03.520
Generous.

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:04.560
Obsessive.

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:05.480
Stubborn.

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:06.600
Was he complicated?

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:07.260
Yes.

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:09.500
And very tall.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.940
People have called him a giant sequoia.

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.500
He was well over 6 feet.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.380
He had a pair of very intense, penetrating eyes.

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:21.140
He was an aficionado of cats.

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:26.060
That’s not a surprise, because I think,
not only cats, but also Lincoln Kirstein

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:27.920
seemed to have had nine lives.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:32.259
Kirstein himself talks about not being bound
by categories.

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:36.569
That expansive view of what art could be was
there from the very beginning.

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.480
He’s most known as the co-founder
of the New York City Ballet.

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.380
But he was so much more than that.

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:44.899
He was an omnivorous cinephile.

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:48.010
He was interested in newsreel avant-garde
films, Eisenstein.

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:53.260
Even as a very young man in his twenties he
understood what it took to build an institution.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.620
Theaters, companies, schools.

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.360
When he wanted to support artists, he was
able to go to his family

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.400
to ask for funds, but it wasn’t without
hand wringing on his part.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.620
Lincoln was always bumping up against power
structures.

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.340
He really struggled for what he believed in.

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.180
His diaries are full of anxiety: “Is this
the right thing?”

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:15.660
“Is this the right path?”

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:20.560
He was married to a woman, but he also had
relationships with men throughout his life.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.220
He helps us to move beyond the limits of conventional
ways of understanding.

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.840
The history of modernism is often one about
medium specificity.

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.200
But Kirstein was someone who was really invested
in the marriage between the different arts.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.240
How could he have been in all these places?

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.400
How could he have done all these things?

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.880
How could he be this, but also that?

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.780
Any one truth about Lincoln is a partial truth.
