Speaker 1:          00:00          The Joe Rogan experience. Did I have to say archaeologists like to insult me by calling me a pseudo scientist? I can't think of anything more pseudoscientific than the Clovis first doctrine, which locked American archeology for 50 years in a particular framework, which we now know was totally wrong. Nothing good about it at all. Uh, a complete mistake. What I'm hoping the book will do in the long run is that it will lead to more attention being focused on the Americas. This is a very neglected area of the world. Uh, as far as deep and ancient archeology goes, I'm, it's, the recent history of the Americas has been relatively well studied, but the deep and ancient history has not been, has not been well studied. And I think America is going to contain revelations for us about our story and about our past. And I'm serious when I, when I suggest that America is the most plausible and the most likely homebase for a lost civilization.

Speaker 1:          01:07          If you're going to propose a loss of realization, you need, there are certain preconditions. You need a, you can't have it on a small island. There's got to be a large land mass with enormous resources and the ability for population to grow and for those resources to be, to be mobilized. And what I suddenly realized, you asked earlier why I, why I started to write this book at all is what the new evidence is pointing to is that the Americas have been wrongly neglected. That here we have a giant continental land mass with extraordinary resources that has just been ruled out of the story of human civilization. But once we take account of the fact that there was a giant cataclysm over North America 12,000, 800 years ago, and once we start looking as I do in America before at the incredible deep indepth similarities between, for example, the religious system of ancient Egypt and the religious system of the Mississippi Valley, then you realize that you're into or into a global mystery here and that the answer to that mystery may not at all be in the old world and may very much be, uh, in the, in the Americas.

Speaker 1:          02:11          See, it's odd. I mentioned Manville earlier on. It's kind of odd that we should find a, what is essentially the ancient Egyptian religion, uh, manifesting in the symbolism of Mountville the ascent to a Ryan that transit to the Milky Way, the journey along the Milky Way. Very, these are very specific and idiosyncratic ideas. And what makes it doubly hard is Mountville isn't that old. Manville as a site is about a thousand years old. Ancient Egypt had already been gone completely from the world, uh, for at least 600 years before Manville was created. The end of ancient Egypt. There's, there's Manville and uh, w w w what we're looking at in the foreground is mount B and we're looking at mount a and the in the, in the distance, um, and, and the complete circle of mountains. What, what is odd about it is we find this system of ancient Egyptian ideas in Manville 500 years after ancient Egypt has gone from the world.

Speaker 1:          03:09          The Romans, the Romans were the end of ancient Egypt by 400 d ancient Egypt has gone. Manville doesn't even exist then, but 600 years later it is created and it manifests the entire set of ancient Egyptian ideas. Clearly it did not get that as a result of direct transmission from ancient Egypt unless they were time travelers. The only way I think it could have got it is as a result of a legacy pass down from a much earlier civilization that has influenced and affected many different parts of the world and the characteristics of that civilization. There's the shamanistic heart of it, the use of altered states of consciousness. The focus on those are amongst the reasons that I would suggest that America is the place that we should be looking and the big mysteries are in the areas that were so devastated at the end of the last ice age up in the north of North America, the channeled scab lands in particular and then the Mississippi Valley. The whole story of the Mississippi Valley. Yes, Mountville is a thousand years old, but then you can go back to poverty point in Louisiana, which is 2,700 years old. You can go to Watson break in Louisiana, which is 5,500 years old. You can go to sites like Conley, which are 8,000 years old. The system keeps on going back and disappearing back into time, and I, I think the most fruitful new work on exploring the origins of civilization is going to occur counterintuitively in the Americas, the very last place on earth that archeologists have ever thought to look.
