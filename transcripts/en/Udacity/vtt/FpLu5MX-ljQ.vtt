00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:05.770
I'm Rachel Zuraw. I'm live here in San Francisco. I'm an attorney

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:10.730
specializing in, intellectual property. Especially pharmaceutical

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:14.070
and biotechnology. With a background in bioethics.

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:20.320
&gt;&gt; Great. Well, we're very happy you're here. we have just learned a little

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.520
bit about Henrietta Lacks And what we learned in the story of Henrietta Lacks

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.340
is her non consensual contribution to science.

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:28.830
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.000
&gt;&gt; And over the years, how her

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.090
cells were used for many great medical advances.

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.420
And her family has ultimately, really hasn't

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.240
been compensated in any way, financially. But has

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:42.950
recently, there have been a couple of

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.690
things that have happened where the NIH has

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.660
put family members on a committee to help

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.010
them decide how the genome of HeLa cells

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.170
is going to be used, who gets the information.

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:54.780
&gt;&gt; Very recently.

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.560
&gt;&gt; Yeah, very, very recently. What I wanted to

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:04.379
talk to you first about was really Just. Actually, You

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.130
know? What are the ethical issues surrounding the use

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.150
of specifically, Hela cells, in the case of Henrietta's story?

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:11.553
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:01:11.553 --> 00:01:15.950
&gt;&gt; But also the, the issue of using tissues from people,

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:17.360
without their consent, in general.

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.220
&gt;&gt; Well, that's a big question, you

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.570
know, what are the ethical issues with this,

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:28.320
because it has to be couched in a way in a long history of failing

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.610
to see consent from people who involuntarily

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:36.720
participated in medical research, like Henrietta Lacks. it's

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.330
one of the fascinating things that Henrietta

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.250
Lacks story and HeLa cells is the ability

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.240
to identify An individual who participated

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.740
in research without her consent. Most of

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:52.860
the time, these sort of looking back at people who accidentally moved research

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.010
forward inadvertently, not voluntarily. That's groups

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:58.010
of people who were in many ways

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:00.940
taken advantage of by the medical establishment.

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:06.580
The researchers who took the cells from

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:07.670
Henrietta, as you've already covered, you

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.970
know, they were attempting. There were multiple

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:16.270
attempts to find this immortal cell line, and they were taking samples from

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:21.550
anyone they could. She was there for therapeutic treatment when they took the

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:29.790
cell line, and at the time the, the cells were harvested from Henrietta Lacks,

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.230
there were not, the informed consent guidelines weren't in place,

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:42.790
requiring. Well, how in-depth should I get to informed consent?

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:48.931
&gt;&gt; well give it a try. I'll stop you.

00:02:48.931 --> 00:02:54.520
&gt;&gt; Okay. So, the Nuremberg Trials of the Nazi

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:58.320
physicians who participated in medical experiments. Well, quasi medical

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.710
experiments in the concentration camps. The, one

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:03.110
of the first principles to come out of

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:06.710
the Nuremberg trials is that the voluntary consent

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:09.700
of a human research subject is absolutely essential.

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.231
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:03:11.231 --> 00:03:12.980
&gt;&gt; And that's been embroidered on in

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.500
United States law and ethical guidelines ever since,

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.150
the informed consent. That any individual participating

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.900
in research needs to be told beforehand They

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.420
need to have all of the information that they are able to

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:32.360
understand, so that they can agree or not, to participate in the research.

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:33.770
&gt;&gt; So, it must be fully voluntary.

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:36.590
&gt;&gt; It must be fully voluntary, fully informed,

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:38.790
and fully voluntary. You can't make a voluntary

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.590
choice to participate, if you don't have all

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.830
of the information. Now you mentioned the Nuremberg trials.

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:44.320
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.450
&gt;&gt; Which happened I believe in the 1940s.

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:46.840
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.940
&gt;&gt; but the Henrietta Lack story

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.270
happened I think in 1951.

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.541
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:03:51.541 --> 00:03:56.100
&gt;&gt; So was there anything extra compounding the issue with Henrietta Lack

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:00.020
that maybe hadn't caught up yet with informed consent in the United States?

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:01.020
&gt;&gt;

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:02.180
[LAUGH].

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:06.660
informed consent in the United States in the early 1950s was still a, a

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:14.250
good theory, y'know, everyone thought that this sounded like a great idea,

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:19.950
but then you have an uneducated patient

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:24.230
in the hospital, who doesn't understand what treatment she's receiving. Is not

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:27.130
advocating for herself. And in the consect of

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:28.610
the time, in the context of the time,

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:31.210
most physicians would not have paused to think,

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:33.750
I should explain to her why I'm taking

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:35.610
this tissue sample and let her know what I'm

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.610
going to do with it. Today, and we can

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:40.450
discuss some other examples, that sort of behavior still

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:45.870
goes on, but it's recognized by the medical establishment.

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:45.970
&gt;&gt; Mm hm.

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:49.550
&gt;&gt; To be an actual intrusion and invasion of

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:52.190
the patient's autonomy. Of the human research subject's autonomy.

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:55.240
&gt;&gt; Now, for people who are hearing about this story for the first

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.770
time. it may be important for us to sort of briefly discuss the

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:03.150
idea that, You know? To use the phrase, maybe she was a victim

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:08.460
of the, sort of. contemporary climate and culture that she was in, may

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:10.570
or may not be true. I mean, I guess what I want to

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:13.170
have you speak to is, there was

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:16.350
nothing specifically malicious done against Henrietta Lacks.

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:16.790
&gt;&gt; Nothing.

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:19.530
&gt;&gt; It's more along the idea that there was a right

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:25.610
that we recognize now, that was violated at that time. that

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:26.190
happened.

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:30.400
&gt;&gt; Exactly. Now that's one of the trickiest things about the Henrietta Lacks

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:37.990
story, I agree, is that at the time when the Hela cell line was first harvested,

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:43.400
there was no recognized duty to tell a patient that you had taken some

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:46.810
of their genetic or cellular material for

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:50.720
research. The researcher who took the material wasn't

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:56.330
even intending to profit off of it. He may have had, he may have felt,

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:58.450
he probably would not have realistically felt

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:00.080
any obligation to tell her if he intended

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:04.420
to market and profit off of the Hela cell line, which he did not. But

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:07.100
his intentions were pure in his mind.

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:09.290
He was trying to advance the scientific cause.

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:10.383
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:06:10.383 --> 00:06:13.470
&gt;&gt; And there was no recognized obligation to

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:15.800
the participants in the study to inform them of

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:16.510
their participation.

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:20.090
&gt;&gt; Right. Now, obviously things have chanced since then, and,

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:20.955
&gt;&gt; Incrementally.

00:06:20.955 --> 00:06:21.945
[LAUGH]

00:06:21.945 --> 00:06:23.110
&gt;&gt; Okay, incrementally, then.

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:25.752
&gt;&gt; Leaps and bounds maybe not as much as we would have liked.

00:06:25.752 --> 00:06:26.058
[LAUGH]

00:06:26.058 --> 00:06:27.058
&gt;&gt;

00:06:26.058 --> 00:06:26.390
[LAUGH]

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:28.470
Well, I want you to speak to that for a second, then.

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:32.080
I mean, did the Henrietta Lack story Change anything? If not at

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:37.120
the time eventually? And if not that were there other cases that,

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:40.200
you know, had a bigger impact on we will get informed concent?

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:46.070
&gt;&gt; Well the Henrietta Lag stories, you know, it wasn't known for more than

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:49.650
40 years. So, when the Immortal Life

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:51.760
of Henrietta Lacks was released, when Rebecca Skloot

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:56.800
sort of publicizing the story then I think the story has now become part of

00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:02.460
a really interesting movement towards control over personal genetic information.

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:07.500
Which I think we're really just seeing the beginnings of, because

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:12.050
legally, there was never a recognized right of

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:17.120
ownership or control of your, well in the past,

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:21.110
tissues, blood sample, etc before genetic information

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:24.000
could be extracted and used from those samples.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.813
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:07:25.813 --> 00:07:28.560
&gt;&gt; But now, you know Henrietta Lacks. You mentioned that

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:32.870
her descendents Are now sitting on a committee to authorize

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:35.010
the use of the genetic information link from the Hela

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:41.350
cells. Likewise, there was a really interesting decision in 2010,

00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:44.540
regarding a small Indian tribe that lives in

00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:47.950
the Grand Canyon. Who had given blood samples

00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:49.920
to a University of Arizona researcher, for it

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:53.169
to be used in diabetes and schizophrenia research.

00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:56.860
one of the members of the tribe found

00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:58.900
out several years after these blood samples were

00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:02.900
donated, that they were being used for purposes

00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:04.810
that the tribe members had not consented to.

00:08:04.810 --> 00:08:06.173
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:08:06.173 --> 00:08:07.340
&gt;&gt; The University

00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:12.390
of Arizona, of course, argued that this was perfectly acceptable,

00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:15.010
they had the samples, they had no right of ownership

00:08:15.010 --> 00:08:20.250
to the samples. However, the ultimate outcome of this case is

00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:25.040
that the trail was able to dictate that they

00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:31.690
would not authorize their blood samples to be used for anything other than the

00:08:31.690 --> 00:08:33.780
original intended purpose and actually all of

00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:36.474
the samples that they donated were destroyed.

00:08:36.474 --> 00:08:37.118
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:08:37.118 --> 00:08:40.570
&gt;&gt; So I mean these are just a couple of isolated examples, case by

00:08:40.570 --> 00:08:43.000
case situations, not really setting the precedent

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.780
for how we're going to be managing,

00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:45.070
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:47.630
&gt;&gt; Genetic information that are, that is in the hands of

00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:50.810
researchers, but, it's indicative of

00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:52.790
the interesting movement towards people becoming

00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:57.650
aware of and taking measures to control the use of their genetic information.

00:08:57.650 --> 00:09:01.520
&gt;&gt; Now, in that same thing, I feel like I've heard, and maybe you'll correct

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:08.110
me if, if I'm wrong, If you know, Is it true that, if I

00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:12.760
had discarded a piece of my tissue or of myself. If I have left skin

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:17.800
cells behind. If I have left bits of me, you know, a hair follicle with

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:22.860
the root attached somewhere and someone finds it, are they free to use

00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:26.990
that sample however they see fit, if it's been discarded from my body?

00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:29.510
&gt;&gt; At this time there'd be nothing to stop them, no.

00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:32.760
&gt;&gt; Is that a hotly debated issue?

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:36.780
&gt;&gt; Discarded genetic tissue, it's being debated. I

00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:38.450
wouldn't call it one of the biggest issues in

00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:41.610
bioethics at the moment, but it's certainly out there

00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:43.190
and I think it's going to become more and

00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:48.210
more of an issue as, well I mean it's a two-fold thing, right? As

00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:53.530
both science advances such that we can do more with a discarded hair follicle.

00:09:55.050 --> 00:09:59.780
And as individuals in society, non-scientists become

00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:01.400
aware of what can be done with

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:03.550
a discarded hair follicle, then I think

00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:05.405
you're going to see a lot more legislation

00:10:05.405 --> 00:10:05.650
[LAUGH]

00:10:05.650 --> 00:10:06.620
aimed at

00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:06.840
&gt;&gt; Sure

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:12.165
&gt;&gt; Aimed at preventing those uses. I mean, we're going to talk about GINA.

00:10:12.165 --> 00:10:12.740
[UNKNOWN]

00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:18.720
genetic nondiscrimination act, which, that was sparked

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:24.890
back in 1995, before there was a very real possibility of workplaces or insurers

00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:27.890
discriminating against people based on what could be uncovered in their

00:10:27.890 --> 00:10:33.200
genome. But science was getting there and people started to worry.

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:38.110
&gt;&gt; Yeah, sure, I mean, it often, it seems that we rarely

00:10:38.110 --> 00:10:42.420
get ahead of the curve on these things. But, that's one of those things where

00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:51.604
they were. I want to ask one more question, more about the Henrietta Lacks

00:10:51.604 --> 00:10:58.530
story. You know, there are people who claim that she sorry, I should say there

00:10:58.530 --> 00:11:00.870
are people who claim that, that the,

00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:03.560
the Lacks family, Henrietta Lacks family, her descendents.

00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:04.910
Henrietta Lacks is deceased.

00:11:04.910 --> 00:11:05.730
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:11:05.730 --> 00:11:11.460
&gt;&gt; But that her family deserves some sort of the financial benefit, that has

00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:17.310
occurred from the use of her cells, and not so much morally speaking but

00:11:17.310 --> 00:11:23.130
legally speaking. When a tissue or a sample from an individual has been taken

00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:28.400
in a way that we consider unethically or illegally today, maybe not at the time,

00:11:30.510 --> 00:11:35.310
what are the ideas surrounding financial compensation, in

00:11:35.310 --> 00:11:37.900
that sense? I mean, is there any validity

00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:40.310
to those kinds of arguments? Or is that

00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:43.140
just more of people arguing from a moral standpoint?

00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:46.480
&gt;&gt; That is a moral standpoint. The commercial

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:48.510
rights to your tissue, once it has been

00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:51.640
separated from your body. Are, for better or

00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:55.712
worse, pretty much zilch. one of the first cases

00:11:55.712 --> 00:11:57.899
on the area was the Regency of the

00:11:57.899 --> 00:12:02.056
United States of California versus Moore decades ago.

00:12:02.056 --> 00:12:05.488
But in that particular case More, the patient

00:12:05.488 --> 00:12:08.304
was going down to UCLA for treatment of

00:12:08.304 --> 00:12:08.920
[UNKNOWN]

00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:10.400
cell leukemia. Yeah.

00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:11.403
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:12:11.403 --> 00:12:16.750
&gt;&gt; His physicians said that they needed to remove his spleen for

00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:22.260
therapeutic treatments. they actually intended without disclosing it to him

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:28.120
to isolate material from his spleen and from his blood sample

00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:33.830
to create a highly profitable cell line. And for years actually,

00:12:33.830 --> 00:12:38.900
they kept him coming down. He lived in, don't remember if it was Washington.

00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:39.634
&gt;&gt; Mh-hm.

00:12:39.634 --> 00:12:43.550
&gt;&gt; I think. they kept him coming down for visits that they said were

00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:46.770
therapeutic for the treatment of his leukemia.

00:12:46.770 --> 00:12:49.120
But they were actually harvesting samples for

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:54.570
use in developing a cell line that I think was valued at about $3 million. Once

00:12:54.570 --> 00:12:59.260
he found out, he sued trying to you know, get a share

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:02.050
of this, not irrationally one would think.

00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:10.240
but the courts ruled that he had the, the doctors of course, violated

00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:15.340
some rather important duties of disclosure. Towards him, that they

00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:19.040
should have, like the guidelines of the American Medical Association, their

00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:21.410
ethical guidelines require that physicians disclose

00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:23.090
if they have any commercial interest.

00:13:23.090 --> 00:13:23.902
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:13:23.902 --> 00:13:24.178
&gt;&gt;

00:13:24.178 --> 00:13:25.380
[LAUGH]

00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:29.770
you said they, physicians violated some duties of care in that vein, of not

00:13:29.770 --> 00:13:34.510
disclosing their commercial interest in his materials.

00:13:34.510 --> 00:13:37.730
But that he had no right to

00:13:37.730 --> 00:13:42.370
any of the profits, derived from his,

00:13:42.370 --> 00:13:45.490
cellular material. And there's actually a line

00:13:45.490 --> 00:13:47.320
of cases on that same principal. And

00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:51.040
this is actually, a really interesting debate

00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:56.941
in intellectual property and in bioethics about

00:13:56.941 --> 00:14:02.370
whether, whether giving

00:14:02.370 --> 00:14:06.100
individuals any kind of commercial right to their bodily materials, and the

00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:10.470
products derived therefrom. A lot of opponents of doing that say that it would

00:14:10.470 --> 00:14:16.960
have a drastic chilling effect on research, that if,

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:21.710
you know, physician researchers were always going to be beholden to the

00:14:21.710 --> 00:14:28.836
individuals who hopefully knowingly donated their material to the research.

00:14:28.836 --> 00:14:33.780
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm. Then the physician researchers wouldn't bother to

00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:35.980
do the research in the first place to explore

00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:39.070
commercial possibilities. I don't know whether or not that's

00:14:39.070 --> 00:14:42.500
true. I'd like to believe a little more in altruism

00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:44.605
than perhaps that debate

00:14:44.605 --> 00:14:45.620
[LAUGH]

00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:46.770
presupposes.

00:14:46.770 --> 00:14:47.340
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:50.590
&gt;&gt; But. Fantasy world, who knows.

00:14:50.590 --> 00:14:50.970
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:14:50.970 --> 00:14:53.200
&gt;&gt; Anyway, that, it's just a really interesting

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:55.100
debate going back and forth, about whether or

00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:57.410
not to allow this kind of commercial interest.

00:14:57.410 --> 00:15:02.330
And also, whether to allow, whether to allow control.

00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:03.081
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:15:03.081 --> 00:15:08.080
&gt;&gt; Over the use of tissues, and now over genetic material. There have

00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:11.840
been a number of fights about whether or not, for example, a physician

00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:17.200
who has collected a number of tissue samples while at one university can

00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:21.970
take those tissue samples with him to his next university. And you know what

00:15:21.970 --> 00:15:27.320
studies can this be used for and do you legally need a,

00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:32.940
legally, you probably don't need a consent of the donors. Ethically,

00:15:35.590 --> 00:15:36.180
Fun question.

00:15:36.180 --> 00:15:39.750
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that is a fun question. Well, so, that, that

00:15:39.750 --> 00:15:41.760
sort of brings us to, to a new point, then. I mean,

00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:45.200
we, we, we've changed in the last 5800 years. We do

00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:51.300
have these new rules of, at least informed consent. Voluntary informed consent.

00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:51.730
&gt;&gt; Mm hm.

00:15:51.730 --> 00:15:55.310
&gt;&gt; And there seems to be a new worry, as you mentioned a second

00:15:55.310 --> 00:16:00.810
ago. In 1995 there was a, a big concern about the power of personal

00:16:00.810 --> 00:16:02.680
genetics, and what it would be used for.

00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:12.140
Why are people so worried about genetic discrimination?

00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:17.552
What is the biggest worry in people normally site

00:16:17.552 --> 00:16:22.832
and say, this is scary, we need to do something

00:16:22.832 --> 00:16:28.030
about this. This is a moral imparity. What is, what is behind that?

00:16:28.030 --> 00:16:30.105
&gt;&gt; Aside from the movie Gatika,

00:16:30.105 --> 00:16:34.137
which I think is behind a lot of it. It's a very scary movie.

00:16:34.137 --> 00:16:34.734
&gt;&gt; It is.

00:16:34.734 --> 00:16:39.016
&gt;&gt; I don't know if you've seen it lately. GINA was conceived

00:16:39.016 --> 00:16:44.398
of in the past because people, people are very concerned that opportunities will

00:16:44.398 --> 00:16:49.468
be forestalled based on a possibility of some genetic issue that could befall

00:16:49.468 --> 00:16:54.920
them later on in life. If that they are being, you know, pre-judged,

00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:59.040
pre-penalized, based on something that might not happen.

00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:01.510
&gt;&gt; It seems very, like, antithetical to the

00:17:01.510 --> 00:17:05.900
western philosophical idea of individualism and free will.

00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:10.940
&gt;&gt; Exactly. I mean, it's. Alright, you can understand, you know, from

00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:14.730
a gut level why of course it's terrifying to think like, you know,

00:17:14.730 --> 00:17:17.569
why are you, why won't you hire me, why are you charging

00:17:17.569 --> 00:17:20.040
me all of this extra money to get health insurance just because someone

00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:21.390
in my family had a health problem that

00:17:21.390 --> 00:17:25.521
will probably never effect me? No, it seems unfair.

00:17:25.521 --> 00:17:26.959
&gt;&gt; Unfair.

00:17:26.959 --> 00:17:31.290
&gt;&gt; which is, you know, a very high-minded, ethical and legal concept.

00:17:31.290 --> 00:17:32.290
&gt;&gt;

00:17:31.290 --> 00:17:32.593
[LAUGH]

00:17:32.593 --> 00:17:33.240
&gt;&gt;

00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:39.100
&gt;&gt; What so, GINA, or the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination

00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:42.500
Act, was passed in 1995, and what did it do?

00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:47.340
&gt;&gt; GINA was actually signed into law in 2008. It was a very long

00:17:47.340 --> 00:17:52.750
process. So, it, the fight to create GINA first began

00:17:52.750 --> 00:17:57.950
in 1995, you know, a bunch of the bills that eventually became

00:17:57.950 --> 00:18:01.930
GINA started circulating through the government back in 95, and

00:18:01.930 --> 00:18:07.300
probably being talked of even earlier. I'm so sorry, you're,

00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:10.780
&gt;&gt; No, I was going to ask what did what did GINA

00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:16.570
do? What did it say, what was the legal meaning behind it?

00:18:16.570 --> 00:18:22.950
&gt;&gt; Well, GINA's general goal is to prevent discrimination by

00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:29.230
employers with 15 or more employees, or by insurers, based on an individual's

00:18:29.230 --> 00:18:32.389
genetic information or family medical history.

00:18:33.690 --> 00:18:36.260
So they included family medical history in

00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:41.590
part because, y'know, not everyone has had their genome sequenced. But the idea

00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:48.530
is, there are a lot of, this breaks down into a lot of different

00:18:48.530 --> 00:18:50.520
provisions, of course, a lot of different

00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:55.240
individual, granual protections. That the, an insurer

00:18:55.240 --> 00:19:03.180
cannot raise premiums based on the fact that, say, my aunt had breast cancer. I

00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:08.400
may or may not carry one of the BRCA gene variants that would increase my

00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:13.780
likely risk of receiving breast cancer. I cannot be charged under GINA a higher

00:19:13.780 --> 00:19:22.060
premium for that. Likewise, your insurer or your employer cannot require that

00:19:22.060 --> 00:19:26.380
you undergo any type of genetic testing to assess your risk for developing any

00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:33.320
condition. Your, it permits of course in health, a health care provider to

00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:36.530
recommend genetic testing for various purposes. But

00:19:36.530 --> 00:19:39.060
even then, an insurer or an employer

00:19:39.060 --> 00:19:42.290
can only collect the bare minimum of information that

00:19:42.290 --> 00:19:45.630
they need to have for coverage decisions. Basically they

00:19:45.630 --> 00:19:52.010
cannot collect and store additional information regarding your genetic

00:19:52.010 --> 00:19:54.950
Make up predispositions, whatever we're going to call it.

00:19:54.950 --> 00:19:56.510
&gt;&gt; Are there ways around that?

00:19:56.510 --> 00:19:58.680
&gt;&gt; How do you mean?

00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:06.030
&gt;&gt; I'm just wondering you know so legally I can't raise your premium because

00:20:06.030 --> 00:20:07.710
you have the BRCA1 mutation,

00:20:07.710 --> 00:20:07.880
&gt;&gt; Mm hm.

00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:13.421
&gt;&gt; But could I raise your premium for some other reason? I mean, do, are there

00:20:13.421 --> 00:20:20.120
any examples? Workarounds where people do end up discriminating based on these

00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:27.660
based on personal genetic information, anyhow? Or is it just, is

00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:30.860
it not even something people really even try or think about doing?

00:20:30.860 --> 00:20:35.900
&gt;&gt; So far, it really hasn't been an issue. and I think it's. I

00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:39.950
think one of the reasons is because, a lot of the early thought in,

00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:44.490
you know, some of the predecessor builds to GINA was, okay. Sure, you can't

00:20:44.490 --> 00:20:46.100
make someone take a genetic test and

00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:49.180
discriminate against them on that basis, but you

00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:51.960
can take down their family medical history, and discriminate against them

00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:56.320
on that basis. Which, of course, you know, principles of genetic inheritance.

00:20:58.540 --> 00:21:03.360
so that's why that got folded into GINA in the first place. I'm not aware of any

00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:07.110
successful work arounds actually that anyone has tried

00:21:07.110 --> 00:21:12.760
yet. Perhaps that's because it's an iron clad law.

00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:13.760
&gt;&gt;

00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:13.230
[LAUGH].

00:21:13.230 --> 00:21:15.390
Such a great piece of legislation.

00:21:15.390 --> 00:21:18.930
&gt;&gt; Or more likely the challenges haven't made it into the courts yet.

00:21:18.930 --> 00:21:19.930
&gt;&gt;

00:21:18.930 --> 00:21:19.540
[LAUGH]

00:21:19.540 --> 00:21:23.120
I could go with either of those. Do

00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:27.500
you feel that concern about genetic discrimination is valid?

00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:33.480
&gt;&gt; Absolutely. I mean,

00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:39.800
you can all to easily imagine an employer, you know, saying,

00:21:40.950 --> 00:21:45.640
you know, let's, let's not say breast cancer, let's say someone who has a

00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:51.030
you know, they've had their genome. they've had their genome coded and they

00:21:51.030 --> 00:21:53.600
show a likelihood, it shows, you know,

00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:55.800
that they will almost certainly develop Huntington's,

00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:56.650
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:21:56.650 --> 00:22:00.175
&gt;&gt; Say, and an employer who wants to make a

00:22:00.175 --> 00:22:02.920
long term investment in an employee if they have access

00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:06.330
to that information, they're allowed to make decisions based on

00:22:06.330 --> 00:22:11.160
it. Might say, you know, we really rather have some

00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:17.100
who'll have a longer working life with us, likewise in insurer. I need insurance

00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:22.220
Make their money based on having the maximum number of

00:22:22.220 --> 00:22:27.310
basically healthy people paying into the insurance pool which then.

00:22:27.310 --> 00:22:27.920
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:32.670
&gt;&gt; Goes to pay for the less healthy people. it is in the

00:22:32.670 --> 00:22:36.400
insurer's best interest to keep as many people who are going to develop

00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:40.020
serious conditions out of that pool as possible. So yeah, I think

00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:45.210
that's a completely rational concern that people have that led to GINA.

00:22:45.210 --> 00:22:47.200
I think it's one of the few occasions when, as you said,

00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:48.580
they got out ahead of the

00:22:48.580 --> 00:22:52.260
possibility of experiencing this type of discrimination.

00:22:52.260 --> 00:22:55.940
&gt;&gt; You know we discussed BRCA1-1 mutations, we talked about the biology

00:22:55.940 --> 00:23:01.850
behind it and we even mention the idea that. And Myriad was

00:23:01.850 --> 00:23:07.520
a company that patented the human gene sequences, the mutations,

00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:12.870
that cause, that are the BRCA1-2 mutation. And these patents have allowed

00:23:12.870 --> 00:23:18.210
them to develop a diagnostic acid that no one else can touch that

00:23:18.210 --> 00:23:22.710
are the three dominant BRCA1-2 mutations. And they

00:23:22.710 --> 00:23:27.450
have fought vociferously in the courts to

00:23:27.450 --> 00:23:28.880
keep those patents.

00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:30.480
&gt;&gt; It was a long and bloody battle.

00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:34.930
&gt;&gt; What what is the current state of gene patenting in the United States?

00:23:34.930 --> 00:23:40.780
&gt;&gt; So the current state of gene patenting, thanks to the decision on

00:23:40.780 --> 00:23:46.799
June 2013, I think it was June 13th, 2013. On the myriad case,

00:23:46.799 --> 00:23:53.770
is that human genetic code is not patentable.

00:23:53.770 --> 00:23:59.650
However, code that is synthesized from, like

00:23:59.650 --> 00:24:06.100
if you, I cannot say, I patent that mutation you have, because I discovered it!

00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:11.220
However, if you synthesize that DNA, a thing that's called CDNA

00:24:11.220 --> 00:24:11.395
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:24:11.395 --> 00:24:18.150
&gt;&gt; That is patentable, because that is a product of human innovation.

00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:25.120
So a lot of the debate over the myriad case and the patenting of genes. Has

00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:32.080
really been about the purpose of patents in the United States. And you

00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:34.010
know this whole history of intellectual property

00:24:34.010 --> 00:24:36.430
protection in the United States. Which is super

00:24:36.430 --> 00:24:40.409
fun stuff that probably doesn't need to be done in depth in a Genetics Course.

00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:46.190
but the purpose of patent code is to

00:24:46.190 --> 00:24:50.180
protect the fruits of, human innovation. Either if you

00:24:50.180 --> 00:24:54.300
have worked on something. And you have created something.

00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:56.940
You are entitled to control it and profit off

00:24:56.940 --> 00:24:59.620
of that. For, you know, protected period of

00:24:59.620 --> 00:25:02.150
time. Which has changed of course, throughout patent protection

00:25:02.150 --> 00:25:05.080
history. Which you're entitled to exclusively profit off of

00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:07.680
that for a period of time as a reward

00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:09.620
for your labor in bringing this new

00:25:09.620 --> 00:25:13.670
thing into the world. So patenting of natural

00:25:13.670 --> 00:25:18.460
materials has actually been, there's a pretty

00:25:18.460 --> 00:25:22.610
extensive case law that this was not something

00:25:22.610 --> 00:25:27.860
that you could do. Because you can't just, you know, discover a mold, scoop it

00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:33.230
out and say, I patent this, I get to use this mold alone. A lot

00:25:33.230 --> 00:25:39.040
of people were arguing that genes, the discovery of genetic

00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:44.770
mutation, took so much effort and took so much ingenuity to isolate. And

00:25:44.770 --> 00:25:49.010
to interpret this information, that that made it patentable.

00:25:50.370 --> 00:25:55.670
And, there actually you know, Myriads patents were not the first to be issued.

00:25:55.670 --> 00:25:57.210
&gt;&gt; Mhmm.

00:25:57.210 --> 00:25:58.690
&gt;&gt; Myriad was really just

00:25:58.690 --> 00:26:01.518
the worst behaved patenter

00:26:01.518 --> 00:26:02.858
[LAUGH]

00:26:02.858 --> 00:26:05.220
a of human genetic information.

00:26:05.220 --> 00:26:06.580
&gt;&gt; They didn't make any friends.

00:26:06.580 --> 00:26:07.620
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:26:07.620 --> 00:26:09.310
&gt;&gt; Even since the Supreme Court decision, it

00:26:09.310 --> 00:26:11.580
seems that they're still going after people. I know

00:26:11.580 --> 00:26:13.600
that there are companies that, you know, were

00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:15.560
trying to run with the Supreme Court decision and.

00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:16.101
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:26:16.101 --> 00:26:17.800
&gt;&gt; Myriad is still suing them.

00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:22.400
&gt;&gt; Yes. Yeah, there, there's plenty of clean-up work left to be done.

00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:23.400
&gt;&gt;

00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:22.848
[LAUGH]

00:26:22.848 --> 00:26:24.390
&gt;&gt; But yeah, over the course of this

00:26:24.390 --> 00:26:28.330
litigation, people were arguing. Instead of invalidating patents

00:26:28.330 --> 00:26:30.160
like this then having this sort of compulsory

00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:34.670
licensing system was another idea that's you know, common

00:26:34.670 --> 00:26:38.990
to further scientific innovation by licensing your patent.

00:26:38.990 --> 00:26:43.550
Licensing your discovery. And the whole problem with myriad's

00:26:43.550 --> 00:26:45.050
holding of all these patents that led to

00:26:45.050 --> 00:26:48.660
all these lawsuits is they didn't grant any licenses.

00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:55.280
Which was putting a choke hold on research. And of course an individuals ability

00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:57.550
to access a diagnostic test to determine

00:26:57.550 --> 00:26:59.450
whether or not they had these mutations.

00:26:59.450 --> 00:27:02.670
&gt;&gt; Now, what about other genes, so, I mean, obviously

00:27:02.670 --> 00:27:05.380
we can't patent human genes, can we patent cat genes,

00:27:05.380 --> 00:27:08.870
can we patent tree genes, can we patent bacteria genes?

00:27:08.870 --> 00:27:14.810
Unless they are synthesized, and therefore a product of human innovation,

00:27:14.810 --> 00:27:15.610
they're not patentable.

00:27:15.610 --> 00:27:17.920
&gt;&gt; Now what I find fascinating, and I don't even

00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:19.600
know if you're aware of this or not, but CDNA.

00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:20.060
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:27:20.060 --> 00:27:22.820
&gt;&gt; And our students don't know about this yet, we haven't talked about it in

00:27:22.820 --> 00:27:28.770
the course, but CDNA is a type of DNA Created when take an MRNA, which is

00:27:28.770 --> 00:27:33.100
when we have a gene in our cell, and it's turned on, it's transcribed into an

00:27:33.100 --> 00:27:41.100
MRNA. We have enzymes that can we can, in a lab, add to that mix and

00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:45.190
turn that MRNA back into DNA. And the interesting thing

00:27:45.190 --> 00:27:48.900
about MRNA is it's spliced together. It originally starts out really

00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:51.110
long, but we cut a lot of pieces of the MRNA

00:27:51.110 --> 00:27:53.310
out, and the resulting MRNA is really short, and it just

00:27:53.310 --> 00:27:56.570
has the genetic information that gets turned into the protein.

00:27:56.570 --> 00:27:59.680
So when you turn an MRNA back into CDNA, you only

00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:02.340
get the relevant coding information that was used, but a gene

00:28:02.340 --> 00:28:06.500
is actually much bigger. A gene itself has tons of information,

00:28:06.500 --> 00:28:09.010
called entrons, that don't end up in the final

00:28:09.010 --> 00:28:12.300
product. But there are genes that don't have entrons, that

00:28:12.300 --> 00:28:16.100
are just entron-less. So the MRNA is pretty much

00:28:16.100 --> 00:28:19.130
the same length as the gene itself. And I'm really

00:28:19.130 --> 00:28:20.810
curious to know what the supreme court thinks of

00:28:20.810 --> 00:28:24.255
that, because technically the information within a CDNA of an

00:28:24.255 --> 00:28:27.440
entron-less gene is the exact same as the gene

00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:31.510
itself. So I just wonder how you know if it

00:28:31.510 --> 00:28:36.800
really is about the nature of the, of the molecule, or if it has to do

00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:39.610
more with the information in the molecule. Like

00:28:39.610 --> 00:28:41.470
is it, is it the idea that it's synthesized?

00:28:41.470 --> 00:28:41.950
&gt;&gt; Hm-mm.

00:28:41.950 --> 00:28:43.490
&gt;&gt; Or is it the idea that the

00:28:43.490 --> 00:28:46.830
particular order of the information is not natural?

00:28:46.830 --> 00:28:51.730
&gt;&gt; That is a really, I mean I think that will be an interesting question when

00:28:51.730 --> 00:28:57.140
it inevitably turns up in court. Because the idea at this point is

00:28:57.140 --> 00:29:02.480
that you can patent something that is synthesized. I don't know what to tell you

00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:04.500
that if the product that you synthesized

00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:10.300
is informationally completely identical to the natural product.

00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:17.940
I mean, the. Although, then, the CDNA that you're working on

00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:22.270
would still be something that you've produced in the lab. The CDNA.

00:29:22.270 --> 00:29:22.890
&gt;&gt; Absolutely.

00:29:22.890 --> 00:29:25.120
&gt;&gt; That is, you know, being circulated to other labs to

00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:29.830
do their research on. That is a lab product. As opposed

00:29:29.830 --> 00:29:33.310
to, you know, I took a sample from Matt, and I

00:29:33.310 --> 00:29:37.770
worked on that because it's informationally identical to the cDNA. So.

00:29:37.770 --> 00:29:39.640
&gt;&gt; Hmm. I'll

00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:40.700
be interested, yeah, I mean.

00:29:40.700 --> 00:29:43.080
&gt;&gt; I'll be interested to see how that, how that shakes out.

00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:43.170
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:29:43.170 --> 00:29:45.950
&gt;&gt; But at this time, the distinction really is

00:29:45.950 --> 00:29:49.580
in the Have you synthesized it? Have you altered

00:29:49.580 --> 00:29:52.500
this from its natural state? And it's not really

00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:54.300
about information altering, although it's

00:29:54.300 --> 00:29:56.620
usually about purifying and distilling.

00:29:56.620 --> 00:29:57.120
&gt;&gt;

00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:03.700
Alright so we're going to transition.

00:30:10.850 --> 00:30:12.810
So we're going to speak more about, sort of, your

00:30:12.810 --> 00:30:16.300
job and, or the idea of bio-ethics in, in general

00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:17.910
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:30:17.910 --> 00:30:22.410
&gt;&gt; How important do you think it is for us to better understand genetic

00:30:22.410 --> 00:30:28.650
information, but also the nexus of genetic and ethics together for

00:30:28.650 --> 00:30:30.960
our future? Do you think this is going to be a more pressing

00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:33.881
need? Do you think we've already figured out most of the hardest stuff?

00:30:33.881 --> 00:30:34.530
[LAUGH]

00:30:34.530 --> 00:30:37.349
And hard stuff behind us? where do you see the

00:30:37.349 --> 00:30:41.290
place of bioethics in the future of genetics and personalized medicine?

00:30:41.290 --> 00:30:45.510
&gt;&gt; I actually think that bioethics and especially

00:30:45.510 --> 00:30:50.928
a knowledge of genetics is increasingly important, because, you

00:30:50.928 --> 00:30:56.170
know, bio-ethics, as a concept, originated as an

00:30:56.170 --> 00:31:00.300
idea of how to protect participants in research, and

00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:04.830
consumers of healthcare. People who don't have all

00:31:04.830 --> 00:31:08.130
of the training, and the information held by

00:31:08.130 --> 00:31:11.060
the physicians and the researchers, who are, you

00:31:11.060 --> 00:31:13.650
know, bossing them around. Standing there in white

00:31:13.650 --> 00:31:15.700
coats looking scary and saying, give me your

00:31:15.700 --> 00:31:17.280
blood, I'm going to go do great things with

00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:22.980
it. It's important in order to, protect autonomy

00:31:22.980 --> 00:31:25.580
that people have, as we've talked about, informed

00:31:25.580 --> 00:31:28.270
consent. You need to have the information going into

00:31:28.270 --> 00:31:31.400
a study. But I don't think protecting informed consent is

00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:34.530
just about giving someone a form when they're coming into

00:31:34.530 --> 00:31:36.930
a study and saying, this is exactly what we're going to

00:31:36.930 --> 00:31:38.620
do, this is what you're going to experience, do you sign

00:31:38.620 --> 00:31:43.870
on the dotted line? Okay. It's about making sure that

00:31:43.870 --> 00:31:48.010
people have the tools to understand their participation in such

00:31:48.010 --> 00:31:51.540
an area, in such a venture in the first place.

00:31:51.540 --> 00:31:53.830
And that's by insuring that people are educated

00:31:53.830 --> 00:31:57.130
about, genetics, about personalized medicine. About, the that

00:31:57.130 --> 00:32:00.120
possibilities their future and their genetic code actually

00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:02.910
hold. What that actually means for them. The

00:32:02.910 --> 00:32:08.160
level of predeterminism, or not. That this information

00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:12.320
actually implies. And, well, I'm perhaps a little

00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:14.180
bit biased in favor of the study of

00:32:14.180 --> 00:32:16.690
bioethics, because I think it is super fun and

00:32:16.690 --> 00:32:22.160
interesting and really important. But, you know science is advancing at

00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:27.170
a pretty breakneck pace, and you know we won't always get out in front

00:32:27.170 --> 00:32:32.270
of it like with GINA, but. Someone needs to be

00:32:32.270 --> 00:32:37.220
paying attention and, you know you never want to say stand

00:32:37.220 --> 00:32:41.700
in the way of any kind of scientific advancement. I don't think that's at all

00:32:41.700 --> 00:32:46.736
what the study of the intersection of ethics and science is about.

00:32:46.736 --> 00:32:47.788
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:32:47.788 --> 00:32:52.720
&gt;&gt; But, ensuring beneficial and responsible use, I think,

00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:56.440
is critical to respecting the people who make research possible.

00:32:56.440 --> 00:32:59.550
&gt;&gt; I want to know, how did you get interested in

00:32:59.550 --> 00:33:02.130
bioethics? What's your background? What did you study in school?

00:33:02.130 --> 00:33:04.150
&gt;&gt; So my background, I came to

00:33:04.150 --> 00:33:07.740
bioethics as a philosophy major, as an undergraduate.

00:33:07.740 --> 00:33:11.700
I, I began studying human rationality,

00:33:11.700 --> 00:33:16.430
mostly. And philosophical conceptions of understanding

00:33:16.430 --> 00:33:20.980
individuals as rational beings. And what your ethical duties to a rational being

00:33:20.980 --> 00:33:26.670
are. That led me into studying informed consent and medical ethics. ' because I

00:33:26.670 --> 00:33:33.170
found it fascinating. I mean especially how you get informed consent.

00:33:33.170 --> 00:33:36.400
How you get any kind of consent from someone who

00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:42.470
isn't rational, was formerly rational, was never rational. Fun questions.

00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:43.128
&gt;&gt; Yeah, seriously.

00:33:43.128 --> 00:33:48.140
&gt;&gt; and then that in tern lead me actually

00:33:48.140 --> 00:33:53.220
to becoming a lawyer. Because I realized that, law is

00:33:53.220 --> 00:33:58.220
the tool that you're actually going to use to make sure that people that

00:33:58.220 --> 00:34:03.580
cannot advocate for themselves, are none the less protected. So.

00:34:03.580 --> 00:34:06.330
&gt;&gt; So, understanding genetics, for you then,

00:34:06.330 --> 00:34:09.040
is Or at least the certain fundamental

00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:11.320
principles of genetics is sort of central

00:34:11.320 --> 00:34:14.000
to understanding what the very questions are.

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:19.679
&gt;&gt; Exactly. my knowledge of genetics. I took some courses on

00:34:19.679 --> 00:34:23.250
genetics as an undergraduate, and you know, sort tried to keep

00:34:23.250 --> 00:34:28.320
up since then. Has been important toward understanding

00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:32.090
what's going on in the world towards isolating my own research questions

00:34:33.870 --> 00:34:38.500
and to my everyday practice as a lawyer which, you know, I don't tangle

00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:43.123
in bioethics everyday. I don't tangle in genetics everyday. But my

00:34:43.123 --> 00:34:48.480
background with, you know, studying science and

00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:51.699
the implications of scientific discovery has landed

00:34:51.699 --> 00:34:54.909
me working in intellectual property and technology in

00:34:54.909 --> 00:35:00.060
my law firmware. I need to be ready to learn and understand a new scientific

00:35:00.060 --> 00:35:02.550
or technological concept based on whatever case

00:35:02.550 --> 00:35:06.190
is thrown at me that particular moment, and.

00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:09.260
You know the tools of knowing genetics has

00:35:09.260 --> 00:35:10.864
helped me in a couple of cases definitely.

00:35:10.864 --> 00:35:11.390
[LAUGH]

00:35:11.390 --> 00:35:14.810
&gt;&gt; That's good to hear. so let's say there's

00:35:14.810 --> 00:35:18.450
somebody watching this interview and they're super excited. They really

00:35:18.450 --> 00:35:21.680
like the idea of bioethics. They like genetics. And

00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:23.470
they're interested in maybe in law and they just want to

00:35:23.470 --> 00:35:26.010
know what they could do. What advice would you

00:35:26.010 --> 00:35:28.930
give to a budding young bioethicist? What would you tell

00:35:28.930 --> 00:35:31.200
them to study? Or what would you tell them

00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:32.930
to do or where would you tell them to work?

00:35:32.930 --> 00:35:37.280
&gt;&gt; A budding young bioethicist. Well,

00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:41.890
I'd tell them to read philosophy. Because again,

00:35:41.890 --> 00:35:45.920
exposing my own bias. where to work? I mean,

00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:48.790
there're a lot of essentially, even when I

00:35:48.790 --> 00:35:52.140
started studying bioethics, there weren't a lot of jobs

00:35:52.140 --> 00:35:55.475
for a bio-ethicist. Now you see jobs for

00:35:55.475 --> 00:35:59.040
bio-ethicists at pharmaceutical companies. You know who want to

00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:01.300
know both how to do their research and how

00:36:01.300 --> 00:36:03.860
to distribute their product. How to market their product.

00:36:05.860 --> 00:36:11.690
hospitals. Definitely need people. There are they need bioethics

00:36:11.690 --> 00:36:17.770
consultants, actually, who mediate between physicians and patients

00:36:17.770 --> 00:36:23.220
to help, help explain the information and the implications

00:36:23.220 --> 00:36:27.990
of it. Genetic counselors are, you know, field, I don't know if you've

00:36:27.990 --> 00:36:31.040
discussed in this class, but that's what, where a lot of bioethicists wind

00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:36.050
up is, translating this kind of, you know, probabilistic

00:36:36.050 --> 00:36:39.720
determinism. You know, translating that to people who don't

00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:43.130
have the educational background always to understand it. And

00:36:43.130 --> 00:36:45.540
help them make their decisions based on that information.

00:36:45.540 --> 00:36:51.690
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm. So, you know, best advice I can give to learning bioethics is just

00:36:51.690 --> 00:36:56.210
be open to figuring out what the next weird issue is going to be and learn all

00:36:56.210 --> 00:36:57.040
you can about it.

00:36:57.040 --> 00:36:58.040
&gt;&gt;

00:36:57.040 --> 00:36:57.650
[LAUGH]

00:36:57.650 --> 00:37:01.180
&gt;&gt; That's why bioethics is fun, right? It's sort of a, a

00:37:01.180 --> 00:37:04.980
mix between hard-nosed practicality and science

00:37:04.980 --> 00:37:09.000
fiction. You're paying attention to, what could

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:14.860
go wrong? And how do we stop that? Or, you know? Aspirational

00:37:14.860 --> 00:37:18.300
fiction. What, what's not great right now? How can we make it better?

00:37:18.300 --> 00:37:21.430
&gt;&gt; Great. Rachel, thank you so much for comin' in.

00:37:21.430 --> 00:37:23.682
&gt;&gt; Thanks for bringin' me in.
