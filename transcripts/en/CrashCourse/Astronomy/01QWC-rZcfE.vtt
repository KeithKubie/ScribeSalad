00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:08.010
Under a dark sky, you can see thousands of
stars. If you watch for a few hours, you can

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.210
see them rise and set as the Earth rotates
once a day.

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:15.160
And if you go outside the next night at the
same time, you’ll see that things’ll look

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:19.980
pretty much the same as they did the night
before. The stars rise and set, Polaris hangs

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.420
to the north, and so on.

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.400
One day hardly makes any difference to the
sky’s appearance.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:30.340
But what if you wait for another night? Or
a week? If you’re that patient, and observant,

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:32.720
you can spot subtle changes in the sky.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.719
Let’s say a couple of weeks have passed.
Remember that star that was just over a tree

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:50.659
in the east when the Sun set -- the one that
made you first notice the stars are rising

00:00:50.659 --> 00:00:52.729
and setting? Go look at it again.

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:56.670
If you happen to be out at the same time,
you’d expect that star to be in the same

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.690
place. But it’s not. It’s actually a bit
higher above the tree. And if you look west,

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:07.439
stars that were well off the horizon just
after sunset last week are now lower.

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.909
If you wait a month, this effect is even more
pronounced; all new constellations will be

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.850
visible in the sky after sunset. This is because
the Earth is going around the Sun, literally

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.600
changing our viewpoint on the sky.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.620
The Earth takes a year to orbit the Sun once.
Every day, it moves a little bit along its

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:29.820
orbit. And as it does, from Earth’s perspective,
distant stars appear to move their positions

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.520
relative to the sun. So, one day we might
see a star very near the Sun, but the next

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.500
day the angle is a bit bigger.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.560
At some point, about six months after we first
saw it, the star is directly opposite the

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.500
Sun in the sky. Then the angle starts to shrink
again as the star approaches the Sun from

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:50.469
the opposite side, until, after a full year,
the cycle repeats.

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:55.500
What this means to you, the naked eye observer,
is that the stars appear to rise and set at

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:59.329
different times over the course of the year.
Stars in the east rise about four minutes

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:03.509
earlier every night, and stars in the west
set four minutes earlier. A constellation

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:08.529
that was entirely below the eastern horizon
at sunset one month might be completely visible

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:10.060
after sunset the next month.

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.160
Another way to think about it is that the
stars appear to be fixed, and as the Earth

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.840
circles the Sun, the Sun moves through the
stars over the course of the year, making

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.720
a complete circle around the sky once per
year.

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:27.170
The path it takes is a reflection of the Earth’s
path around the Sun, a line in the sky. We

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:28.980
call that line the ecliptic.

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.160
That means the Sun passes through the same
constellations in the sky every year. We give

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.890
those constellations a special name: the zodiac.
Every year, during a given month, the Sun

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:43.580
will appear to be in a certain zodiacal constellation,
from Sagittarius through Scorpius, Libra,

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.820
Virgo, Leo, Cancer, and the rest.

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:51.100
Eventually, over a year, the Sun returns to
Sagittarius, and the cycle starts again. But

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:55.170
even though we talk about this process in
terms of the sun’s movement, it’s really

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.890
the path traveled by the Earth that creates
this effect, as our perspective moves with it.

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:05.220
And of course, the planets move in the sky
as well. Mercury, Venus, Mars… they orbit

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.800
the Sun, too, and they do so in approximately
the same plane the Earth does. If you could

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.630
see the solar system from the side, it would
look flat!

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:16.780
So to us, on Earth, the planets go around
the sky over the course of a year, and they

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.390
also appear to change their positions relative
to the Sun and the stars.

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:25.030
The inner planets, Mercury and Venus, move
so rapidly you can see their motion after

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.400
a single night. The outer planets are more
leisurely, but wait long enough and they too

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.640
will be seen to move, sliding through the
constellations.

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.040
By the way, the word “planet” is Greek
for “wanderer."

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.720
There’s another aspect of all this you might
notice over time.

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:43.020
You’ve probably seen a globe, and noticed
that the axis of it is tilted; that is,

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:47.180
it’s not straight up-and-down, perpendicular
to how it sits. That’s because a globe is

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.700
modeling the Earth and the Earth is tilted.

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:55.570
The Earth spins on its axis once per day,
and orbits the Sun once per year. But the

00:03:55.570 --> 00:04:02.050
Earth’s axis is tilted with respect to its
orbital plane by 23.5 degrees. And this has

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:03.830
a profound effect on our planet.

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:08.900
Imagine for a moment that the Earth’s axis
were exactly perpendicular to its orbit, straight

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:13.110
up and down. If that were the case, every
day, the Sun would take the same path across

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:17.870
the sky. If you were on the equator the Sun
would rise, go exactly overhead, and then

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:21.370
set. If you’re on the pole, the Sun will
appear to go around the horizon every day,

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:23.910
neither rising nor setting — it would always
be twilight.

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:29.130
But that’s not the case. The Earth is tilted.
In the months of June and July, the Earth’s

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:35.000
north pole is tipped toward the Sun. Six months
later it’s pointed away. This affects the

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.070
path the Sun takes across our sky.

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:41.020
Instead of it taking the same path every day,
in the northern summer, when we’re tipped

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:45.680
toward the Sun, the Sun takes a higher path
in the sky. Because that path is longer,

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.120
the days are longer, too.

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:51.660
Six months later, in December and January,
the Earth’s pole is tipped away. The Sun

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:56.290
takes a lower path in the sky, and because
the path is shorter days are shorter too.

00:04:56.290 --> 00:05:00.250
That’s why we have seasons! When the Sun
is up high in the sky it shines straight down

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:04.389
on the ground, heating it better, and days
are longer so it has more time to heat us

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:06.429
up. It gets hot.

00:05:06.429 --> 00:05:11.160
In the winter, it’s the reverse: The Sun
is lower so it can’t warm us up as efficiently,

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.880
and it has less time to do so. It gets cold.

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:18.360
There you go: seasons. The Earth’s axis
is tipped. If it weren’t, the seasons wouldn’t

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:21.430
occur, and the temperature of the Earth wouldn’t
change month to month.

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:25.260
There’s a common misconception that the
Earth has seasons because it orbits the Sun

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:30.170
on an ellipse, and so it’s closer to the
Sun in summer and farther in winter. While

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:35.220
it’s true the orbit is elliptical, Earth
is closer to the sun in January -- on the

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:40.050
order of 5 million kilometers or so -- than
it is in July. It’s the angle of the sun’s

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:44.270
rays that makes winter cold and summer hot,
not our distance from the sun.

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:48.600
Also, you may know that when it’s summer
in the northern hemisphere, it’s winter

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:53.810
in the southern. When the north pole is tipped
toward the Sun, the south pole is tipped away,

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:56.970
so northern and southern hemisphere seasons
are opposite each other.

00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:01.600
But nothing in astronomy is permanent. The
north pole’s not always going to point toward

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:05.550
the sun in June, and Polaris is not always
going to be the North Star.

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:09.120
That’s because our planet’s axis is actually
moving.

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:13.370
Have you ever seen a spinning top start to
wobble, its axis moving in a slow circle even

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:18.120
as the top itself spins? This is called precession,
and the Earth does it too! Our planet spins

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:23.920
on its axis once per day, but the axis wobbles,
making a very slow circle that takes

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:26.560
26,000 years to complete.

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:30.500
This affects a lot of what we see in the sky.
For example, Polaris won’t always be the

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:34.910
pole star! Every year, the pole points a little
farther from that star, making a big circle

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:39.260
47 degrees across. For ancient Egyptians,
the star Thuban was the pole star, and in

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:43.300
about 11,000 years that position will be held
by the bright star Vega.

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:48.290
Also, the date the Sun is in a particular
zodiac constellation changes slowly due to

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:52.580
precession as well. When the ancients first
thought up this idea, the Sun was in Aries

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:57.040
on March 22, the vernal equinox (what some
people call the first day of spring). But

00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:01.990
due to precession, it’s now in Pisces! That’s
why your astrological sign doesn’t match

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:07.139
where the Sun actually is in the sky; 2000
years of precession has changed them…one

00:07:07.139 --> 00:07:09.710
of the many reasons astrology is silly.

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:14.510
It’s incredible to think about: The Earth,
the Sun, the stars: they allow us to tell

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:19.560
the time and time of year just by looking
up and paying attention. This is why the stars

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:25.340
were so important to ancient humans. The stars
were like a clock and a calendar in the sky,

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:27.260
long before we had invented either.

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:30.970
We’ve actually learned a lot about the sky
just by looking at it. Of course, some of

00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:34.130
the stuff I’ve explained we’ve learned
through other means – the Earth is spinning,

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:37.890
stars have different intrinsic brightnesses,
and so on. But all of that knowledge, and

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:42.400
far more, got its start by people who went
outside and looked up. Later, as we applied

00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:46.080
math and physics to what we observed we
learned even more, and could then go back

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:47.460
and explain what we saw.

00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:51.800
So don’t discount naked eye astronomy; it’s
all we had for thousands of years.

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:56.410
In fact, I think we lost something when we
started using clocks and calendars, and moving

00:07:56.410 --> 00:08:00.190
to cities with bright lights that washed away
the stars from the sky. Those folks long ago

00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:04.940
were tied to the sky; they knew it like you
know the streets in your neighborhood. They

00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:09.169
could see the stars rise and set, they knew
the glory of the Milky Way sprawled across

00:08:09.169 --> 00:08:12.490
the heavens, even if they didn’t know exactly
what it was.

00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:17.139
We do know, now, with our knowledge gained
over the centuries. But it comes at the cost

00:08:17.139 --> 00:08:22.070
of losing touch with the sky, not living under
it as much as we once did. I’ve spent thousands

00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:27.290
of hours over my life at night just simply
looking up, watching the stars, appreciating

00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:31.639
the Universe as I can see it. The things I
have witnessed have shaped my life, and instilled

00:08:31.639 --> 00:08:35.319
in me a permanent and endless sense of wonder
and joy.

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:41.159
The Universe belongs to everyone. Go outside
and, if you can, soak up your share.

00:08:41.159 --> 00:08:45.509
Today we talked about cycles: As the Earth
goes around the Sun we see stars rising and

00:08:45.509 --> 00:08:50.009
setting at different times, the Sun moves
along a line in the sky called the ecliptic,

00:08:50.009 --> 00:08:53.990
through a set of constellations called the
zodiac — really a reflection of the Earth’s

00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:58.530
motion around the Sun — that the planets
move more or less along the ecliptic as well,

00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:02.520
and that seasons are caused by the tilt of
the Earth’s axis together with its annual

00:09:02.529 --> 00:09:03.629
orbit around the Sun.
