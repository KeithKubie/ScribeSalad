00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.680
Humans have invented a variety of amazingly
cruel and unusual ways to kill or maim one

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.250
another (often for shockingly arbitrary reasons).

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:23.119
And, of course, wars tend to bring out the
worst in people; so it’s not surprising

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:27.320
that war-time executions can occasionally
be among the most bizarre and cruel.

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.090
On that note, I was recently reading the first
volume of John Masters’ autobiography, Bugles

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.710
and a Tiger, and came across one of the more
bizarre execution methods, death by drowning

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:37.309
a person in urine.

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:42.940
This method of execution was used by the Pathans
(also known as “ethnic Afghans” and “Pashtuns”).

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.220
The women of this group, particularly in the
Afridi tribe of the Pashtuns (who today primarily

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:52.160
reside in present-day Pakistan and Afghanistan),
would occasionally execute people this way,

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.300
as mentioned by the British John Masters who
was stationed in British India when he was

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.410
18 in 1933.

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:02.050
…if they [Pathans] captured any soldiers
other than Muslims, and especially if the

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.860
soldiers were Sikhs or British, they would
usually castrate and behead them.

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.770
Both these operations were frequently done
by the women.

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.159
Sometimes they would torture prisoners with
the death of a thousand cuts, pushing grass

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:14.640
and thorns into each wound as it was made.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.080
Sometimes they would peg the prisoner out
and, with a stick, force his jaws so wide

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.300
open that he could not swallow, and then the
women would urinate in his open mouth (taking

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:23.930
turns) till he drowned.

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.170
This kind of cruelty was not confined to war,
but was as much a part of the Pathans’ normal

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:27.170
lives as were their sturdy independence…

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.850
If a man suspected his wife of the most minor
infidelity, he would cut her nose off…

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.869
The Pathans punished an adulterer by forcing
a thick and knobbly thorn twig down his penis.

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:39.150
They rewarded infringements of lesser laws
by tearing a man’s tongue out by the roots.

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.150
If that all weren’t cringe-worthy enough:

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:41.150
It is still customary among some tribes in
Assam (northeastern region in India)… to

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:42.150
punish an unfaithful woman by tying her to
a post with her legs apart over a quick-growing

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.150
kind of bamboo, and leaving her there until
the bamboo grows up into her womb and stomach

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:44.150
and she dies.

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:45.150
Bizarrely, particularly given their stance
on women and adultery, there are also a few

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.550
reports of these “death by golden shower”
executions being preceded by the women first

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:51.560
gang raping the condemned man before drowning
him in their urine.

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.810
Lest you go away thinking that it was just
the Pashtuns who instituted various cruel

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:02.750
punishments, during these various skirmishes
that Masters was involved, he gives an account

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.850
of a lot of cruelty on both sides.

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.439
For instance, in one case a wounded tribesman
(both his legs broken) was captured.

00:02:09.439 --> 00:02:14.420
Contrary to an order given by the commanding
officer of this battalion (no prisoners),

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.299
his soldiers brought him in as a prisoner.

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:21.191
The officer was furious and then “ordered
the prisoner to be pegged out, face up, in

00:02:21.191 --> 00:02:22.191
front of the quarter-guard.

00:02:22.191 --> 00:02:26.120
There was no shade and the sun temperature
was probably about 130.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.950
The further order was that every man who passed
should kick the prisoner in the testicles.”

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:48.559
The prisoner died later that evening 
and his body was placed in a location where

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:59.260
a 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:09.019
British soldier had previously been flayed
alive by the Pashtuns.
