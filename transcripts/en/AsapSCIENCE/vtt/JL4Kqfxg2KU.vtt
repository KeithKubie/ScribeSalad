00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.800
Seventy years ago, the nuclear bombs dropped over Hiroshima and Nagasaki

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:09.420
exploded and to this day remained the only use of nuclear weapons for warfare, but with around

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.830
15,000 warheads remaining in the world

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:19.350
What happens if we have a nuclear war? The impact of a single nuclear bomb depends on many factors like the weather, weapon design,

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:24.800
geographical layout of where the bomb hits and if it explodes in the air or [on] the ground. Approximately

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:28.769
35 percent of the energy comes in the form of thermal radiation or heat

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:30.250
since thermal radiation

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:37.590
Travels at approximately the speed of light the flash of light and the heat comes several seconds before the blast wave and this causes flash

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:45.360
Blindness to anyone looking a temporary blindness of a few minutes with a one megaton bomb which is 80 times larger than the hiroshima bomb

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:52.169
but much smaller than many modern nuclear weapons those 21 kilometers away would experience flash blindness on a clear day and

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.989
Even up to 85 kilometers away on a clear night

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:00.809
Thermal radiation burns happen closer to the bomb with first-degree burns occurring around 11 kilometers

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:07.769
Second-degree burns at 10 kilometers and third-degree burns destroying skin tissue at 8 kilometers third-degree burns that cover over

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:15.449
[24%] of the body will likely be fatal without quick medical care these distances are variable depending on the weather and what clothing you're wearing

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:23.220
White clothing for example can reflect some of the energy well darker clothes absorb it at its [center] the hiroshima explosion was estimated to be

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:26.368
[300,000] degrees Celsius which is over

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:30.960
300 times hotter than the temperature bodies are cremated at this intense heat

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.939
Reduces a body to its basic elements the radiation from the blast also behaves like sunlight

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:39.629
So [object] cast shadows where the radiation doesn't directly hit

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:45.509
But most of the energy released in the nuclear explosion is in the blast which drives air away from the site of the explosion

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.920
creating a sudden change in air pressure

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:54.930
That can crush objects or knock them down [if] we use a [1] megaton bomb as an example again within a 6 kilometer radius

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:56.920
There would be an estimated

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.409
180 tons of Force on the wall of Every two-story building with wind speeds of

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:09.208
255 kilometers an hour within a 1 kilometer radius the peak pressure is four times greater and wind speeds reached

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:14.119
756 kilometers an hour the human Body can endure this amount of pressure

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.870
However the winds would create fatal collisions with nearby objects

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:25.549
So deaths would largely be from collapsed buildings all this at one megaton compare that with the largest nuclear bomb ever detonated

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:31.429
the 50 megatons Tsar bomba dropped on an isolated Island in Russia, and you're looking at

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:38.450
3333 Hiroshima bombs combined if you happen to survive all this now you have to worry about radiation

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:44.209
Now not all radiation is harmful. We're exposed to different forms of radiation every day like our phones

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:50.059
But ionizing radiation at the center of a nuclear bomb has enough energy to rip electrons from atoms

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.469
But the amount of radiation you encounter is greatly affected by whether you're outside?

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.070
or inside in a wooden structure or a cement structure and so on

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:04.399
exposure to 600 rem Radiation has a [90] [percent] chance of creating fatal illness while a dose of

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:11.630
450 rem is estimated to create a fatal dose within half of those affected, but even those who recover still suffer long-term

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:19.909
molecular bonds and strands of Dna are broken and while most repair around a corridor don't which can result in future genetic mutations and

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:21.930
increased probability of cancer

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.550
Then there is the fallout

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:29.329
When a bomb is detonated on or near the surface of the Earth the blast creates a crater and the material that used to be

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:37.190
Deposited in the crater is carried up [into] the air as vaporized dirt particles forming the familiar mushroom cloud these particles become radioactive

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:40.460
And eventually condense and come back down as fallout

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:42.540
depending on wind conditions

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:49.159
Radioactive fallout can travel for hundreds of miles and though it can fall in the form of black rain for the most part you can't

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.070
detect fallout with your senses luckily fallout radiation

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:59.089
Decays Fairly quickly and within two weeks material will have declined to about 1% of its initial radiation level

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.080
But you would have to stay in a shelter

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:05.809
Until then so what is a Multi bomb Nuclear war broke out a recent study?

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:13.190
Imagined what 100 detonated warheads the approximate size of a her ocean bomb would look like if India and Pakistan went to war

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.279
These two nations have relatively small stockpiles of weapons

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:21.739
Compared to countries like the us Russia and China however this would still do huge damage

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:26.909
after the Nuclear Exchange 5 megatons of [Blackrock] would immediately enter the atmosphere

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:31.890
Causing global temperatures to fall and receive 9% less rain annually, [though]

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:36.149
these changes sound small they could be enough to Trigger crop failures and famine a

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:39.809
separate study estimated two billion people would starve in the wake of a

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:47.219
100 a bomb war so what should you do we created a video called how to survive a nuclear war that looks into strategies for

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:51.269
