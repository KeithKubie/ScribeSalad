who couldn't be here this
afternoon; he sends his regrets.

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.020
But let me introduce our
speaker for the 79th lecture

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.330
in our topics in preservation
series.

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:40.530
Paul Messier is our speaker and
his innovations in the field

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:47.940
of conservation are noteworthy: the
formation of a reference collection

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.670
of photographic papers and related
project regarding the development

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:56.040
of the texture scope, topics
that Paul discussed here in 2010

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.410
and are available on
our series of webcasts

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.850
on the preservation website.

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.100
Along with these accomplishments,
for many years Paul was principle

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.100
of the successful photograph
conservation practice Paul Messier

and characterization of 19th

and 20th century photography
especially the characterization

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.720
of the photographs of
Louis Hein and Menrey.

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.390
I'd also say that along
with his work

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.470
in that practice he's trained
a number of people many

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.520
of whom are here and on the webcast
and I know they're all appreciative

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.090
of his efforts in that regard too.

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.120
Well, this practice is
still strong and on-going.

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.610
In 2015, Paul was appointed
head of the Lens Media Lab,

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.040

His talk today, Expressive
Dimensions

Of Photographic Papers is
another chapter of Paul's work

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.570
to better understand the
materials used by photographers

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.040
so that we can better interpret
them and care for them.

thanks to everybody for showing up.

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.430
It's really nice to see
somebody familiar faces,

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.110
it's great, great to be here.

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:10.900
So let's get started, okay.

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:13.720
Without any fooling around,

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.140
this is one of my favorite
things in the world.

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:19.750
This is a gaverit sample book

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.750
of photographic papers
from the mid-1930s.

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.080
I'm just going to play around these
a little bit and you get the sense

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.520
of why this is just so cool.

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:39.530 position:56%
You know, and when you look at this,
is just like unnecessary greatness.

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:47.030
I mean how many surfaces
is that 38, 36.

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.220
No, well I can't count right now,
somebody can do 4 times 9 minus 2.

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:52.520
&gt;&gt; Thirty seven.

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.120
&gt;&gt; Paul Messier: Thirty seven,
no, it is not an odd number.

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.600
&gt;&gt; Thirty four.

&gt;&gt; Paul Messier: Thirty
four, okay, class dismissed,

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.290
let's go, let's, I'm done.

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.760
Yeah, okay, that is
very good Andrew.

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.390
So, yeah, I mean why does any
company need so many surfaces

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:13.690
of black and white paper?

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:14.990
What's going on here?

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:18.960
And I think, you know, we,
the black and white medium

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:21.900
that we have received
in the 21st century,

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:27.670
what's left of it is this kind of
dim echo of this amazing diversity

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:34.030
that was, that existed for much
of the century and you know,

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:37.510
this is sort of a microcosm
of what was available.

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:42.670
This is one company's paper
selection for one year,

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.110
if you multiply this by
five or eight, you know,

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:50.690
international companies, big
corporations like Kodak and Ilford

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:54.740
and Agfa and many other smaller
companies, you get a sense

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:56.190
of how rich the medium

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.590
of black-and-white silver
gelatin whatever you want

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:07.480
to call photography is, and it
became important to me to try

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:11.210
to catalog, to try to
understand this diversity and try

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:14.440
to understand what was going
on, what was promoting this,

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:19.880
why did they need so many
surfaces, what did that represent?

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:25.210
And one of the ways that I
settled on in terms of trying

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:30.700
to get a handle on all of this
is just really looking closely

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:33.630
at a package of paper
and on the package

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:41.060 position:56%
of paper is pretty much all you
really need to know about one aspect

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:43.380
of characterization,
one aspect of how

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:48.170
to characterize a photographic
paper and let's see

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:50.460
if I can get this to
work yeah, okay.

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:56.320
So what we're looking at here
is basically four dimensions

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:02.150
that the manufacturers were
trying to convey to photographers

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:05.720
and that photographers
were fluent in at the time.

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:07.610
So here are the four dimensions.

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:08.910
What's the base color?

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:10.210
What color is the base?

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:12.260
In this instance it's ivory white.

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.540
What's the texture
and what's the gloss?

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:18.750
Here we have one word per color
which refers to both texture

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:21.680
and gloss, if you know
per color is a fabric,

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:24.600
it's a tightly woven
I think cotton fabric

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:30.490
with the satiny lustery finish
so both a texture and a gloss.

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:35.090
And then what's the base, what's
the support, how fit is it really?

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:37.510 position:56%
I mean that's basically all that is.

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:41.870
How much of an assertive physical
presence does the material have

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:45.570
and so this is, you know, this
is a kind of carton, it is,

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:48.230
you know, it's a thicker support.

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:50.980
So here we have the four dimensions

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:56.880
that as I say there was a real
fluency in these four dimensions

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:00.800
that I think, you know, we don't
actually perceive so much anymore

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:04.030
in terms of contemporary
black and white papers.

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:11.560
I did a project in 2012 at
the Museum of Modern Art.

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:14.740
My research was really
focused on well can I make,

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:18.900
can make those four dimensions
relevant in a contemporary context

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:24.640
where they are useful for anything
when it comes to classification,

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:27.610
characterization of
photographic materials.

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:30.780
And so, you know, this is one
of the prints that I was looking

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:34.860
at was this Helmar Lerski
in the MOMA collection.

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:37.400
And so here are the four dimensions

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:40.300
and then the first three are
actually really pretty easy

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:41.600
to measure.

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:45.360
Thickness, well, you just
get a micrometer, gloss,

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:49.640
you get a gloss meter and this
is all pretty conventional stuff.

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:52.800
Color spectrophotometer
and what I'm measuring

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:56.920
or what I'm representing here
is just how yellow it is,

00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:02.880
how far along on this B axis
in the LAP color space is it.

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:05.770
So it's 5.7 okay, great.

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:12.300
Texture was a problem
and we convened a group

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:16.820
of signal processing engineers
and we asked them to look

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:20.640
at texture images to try
to back out some numbers

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:24.410
to help us classify paper texture.

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:28.420
So we settled on a method
that kind of centered

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:31.980
on a two-dimensional
raking light image

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:37.150
of the surface of a
photographic paper.

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:42.360
Represented here is about six
and half millimetre square

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:45.680
and so we took images like this

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:48.290
and we had four different signal
processing teams and they came

00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:50.300
up with four different algorithms

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:52.710
for classifying these
kinds of images.

00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:58.060
One of them does what I
would do if I knew anything

00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:02.920
about signal processing, I mean the
difference is, mine is in my head

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:05.150
and there's actually works.

00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:12.590 position:56%
It's based on using the brightness
of the pixels as a proxy for height.

00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:16.030
So the brighter the pixel
the higher the surface,

00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:19.670
the darker the pixel the lower
the surface and when you do

00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:22.980
that you can conceive of an
image, a two-dimensional image

00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:25.120 position:56%
in a really a three-dimensional way.

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:29.160
And this is all false and rendered
but you see what's going on here.

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:34.380
So you can take that
pseudo-topography let's call it

00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:36.800
and then you can start
breaking it down and backing

00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:42.180
out some numbers and, you know,
now we have these fractals.

00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:45.160
We basically cast the
net over our surface

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:48.650
and we have different
mesh dimensions.

00:08:48.650 --> 00:08:51.700
We can cast a really wide
net or really narrow net

00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:56.930
and that becomes a
classification scheme,

00:08:56.930 --> 00:08:58.560 position:56%
so we can back out some numbers now.

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:04.260
So this is amazing, just
wait for it texture, okay?

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:15.310
Yes, I mean 4.9 scale one
pseudo-area scale fractal analysis,

00:09:15.310 --> 00:09:17.390
okay, I know what a
millimeter is, you know,

00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:19.780
and I kind of can see
what a gloss unit is,

00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:24.920 position:56%
although that's pretty abstract but
I'm not, you know, so these numbers,

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:27.610
well, they're are important.

00:09:27.610 --> 00:09:30.910
They're almost, they're
non-nutritive,

00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:35.660
it doesn't convey the information
that I really needed to convey.

00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:40.150
So I started to think about how
we can make put those numbers

00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:45.840
into context and as some
you may know I've, you know,

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:52.300 position:56%
I've been obsessively collecting
photographic papers for a long time.

00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:57.620
And I have like around
6000 and I was so glad

00:09:57.620 --> 00:09:59.050
to see Laurene [assumed
spelling] here

00:09:59.050 --> 00:10:01.480
because Laurene Vargo [assumed
spelling] was in my studio

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:04.240
at the start of this
collecting and she did a lot

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:07.460
of the initial cataloging
on this collection.

00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:10.510
And this collection is
come with me to Yale

00:10:10.510 --> 00:10:13.730
and it's really the
foundation of the work at least

00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:19.480
in the initial phases
of the Lens Media Lab.

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:25.380
So let's just call this the genome
and so let's put those numbers

00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:28.590
into context of the genome.

00:10:28.590 --> 00:10:33.380
How can we, you know, what do we
learn when we compare the numbers

00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:42.050 position:56%
for a particular print to, you know,
6000 or so photographic papers,

00:10:42.050 --> 00:10:44.280
that gives us the context
that we need.

00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:47.900
And so we can take this or
here's an example of that.

00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:52.800
This is like a really easy
example to understand I think.

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:56.150
There's a few thousand
thickness measurements here

00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:58.710
from the collection and
you can see, you know,

00:10:58.710 --> 00:11:01.160
it's intrinsically
valuable information.

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:03.280
I mean you can see, you
know, there's breakout

00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:07.550
of single weight papers as single
weight was actually thinner before

00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:11.640
1930 and then it got a
little thicker after 1930.

00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:14.750
Double weight, you know, you can
see the range of double weight,

00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:18.910
you can see after 1980, you
know, when the industry is sort

00:11:18.910 --> 00:11:21.920
of beginning to collapse
and consolidate.

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:27.440
You see a collapsing consolidation
of single and double weight

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:31.030
into this sort of mushy
medium way kind of thing.

00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:34.730
Okay, that's interesting in and of
itself but if you put the Lerski

00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:37.090
in here which measures
at one, you know,

00:11:37.090 --> 00:11:40.620
about 0.17 or so millimeters thick.

00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:44.740
You can see it's right in the
heart of single weight papers

00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:47.480
but you can also kind of
intuitively see that, you know,

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:50.000
there is about fifteen
percent papers that are thinner

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.510
and about eighty five percent
papers that are thicker.

00:11:53.510 --> 00:12:00.440
And so using that, you know, as a
strategy we can put these numbers

00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:05.160
into a better context, we
can replace all of that

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:09.570
with just really kind
of simple visualizations

00:12:09.570 --> 00:12:13.030
and that's just based
on a percentile.

00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:17.180
So for the Lerski, you know,
like I said about fifteen percent

00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:19.780
of papers are thinner so
that's the fifteen percent

00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:23.530
about eighty five are thicker.

00:12:23.530 --> 00:12:29.420
Gloss it's a pretty matte paper, is
a lot of papers that are glossier.

00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:36.020 position:56%
Color is right in the middle between
kind of neutral like bluish white

00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:39.110
and warm white with stripes
it splits the difference

00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:41.790
in texture it's got
a lot of texture.

00:12:41.790 --> 00:12:43.290
Alright, well, that's great.

00:12:43.290 --> 00:12:47.550
So, you know, how can we
really use this information?

00:12:47.550 --> 00:12:50.370
How can we better use
this information?

00:12:50.370 --> 00:12:58.680
I'm all about, you know, trying to,
you know; visualize these things

00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:00.930
into as intuitively as possible.

00:13:00.930 --> 00:13:02.700
And So this is a step
in the direction.

00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:05.860
If you've got any great ideas
about how to visualize this data

00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:09.250
and make it more accessible
I would love to here it.

00:13:09.250 --> 00:13:15.120
So I arrange those four axes
like this and I put kind

00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:19.370
of the more expressive
dimensions, the rougher papers,

00:13:19.370 --> 00:13:23.500
the thicker papers, the more matte
papers, the more warm papers.

00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:27.090
I've oriented them to the
outside of this kind of

00:13:27.090 --> 00:13:29.170
but going to become this glyph.

00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:33.750
Here's the Lerski data
plotted and I want to clean it

00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:39.090
up a little bit and that.

00:13:39.090 --> 00:13:46.350
So that is my, well, it's a glyph;
it's a thumbprint that stands

00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:52.000
in for the material characteristics
of this photographic paper.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.700
And so it gives me a really
quick visual reference of what,

00:13:56.700 --> 00:14:02.430
not what this image is but
what this material is so, okay.

00:14:02.430 --> 00:14:05.750
So how do you use that?

00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:08.050
How can that be useful to us?

00:14:08.050 --> 00:14:10.320
I think we're going to go
back to my favorite thing

00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:13.510
and we're going to
look at two papers.

00:14:13.510 --> 00:14:17.630
This is called Large X [assumed
spelling]; I think that's right

00:14:17.630 --> 00:14:21.110
and this is called Doug Divalux
Velore [assumed spelling].

00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:26.950
And so Large X on the left and
Divalux Velore on the right

00:14:26.950 --> 00:14:32.490
and you can see Doug Divalux is
plotted in the sort of glyph right

00:14:32.490 --> 00:14:38.290
at the edges of the universe
of expressive possibilities.

00:14:38.290 --> 00:14:41.780
It's got more texture, it's
thicker, it's more matte,

00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:46.440
it's warmer than any of the papers,
most of the papers by far most

00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:50.270
of the papers in the
collection that I've measured.

00:14:50.270 --> 00:14:55.220
And this was a deluxe paper,
this was a paper designed

00:14:55.220 --> 00:15:01.690
for highly expressive
self-realized photographic artists,

00:15:01.690 --> 00:15:05.260
it was incredibly expensive, it was
the most and they were proud of it.

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:09.560
It's the most expensive
photographic paper of the time.

00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:13.430
They called it the most
beautiful photographic paper, no;

00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:17.350
they called it the most
beautiful paper ever manufactured.

00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:19.560
Didn't call it the most
beautiful photographic paper;

00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:22.920
the most beautiful
paper ever manufactured.

00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:25.610
It was sold in very
few contrast grades,

00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:26.910
you had to know what you're doing,

00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:31.070
you had to have a good
negative to print with this.

00:15:31.070 --> 00:15:33.930
On the other hand large X [assumed
spelling] which occupies the sort

00:15:33.930 --> 00:15:39.720
of inside of this universe of
possibilities, this is, you know,

00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:41.610
the faster they come to
better you'll like it.

00:15:41.610 --> 00:15:46.140 position:56%
What they're talking about is
photofinishing, this is a paper made

00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:47.940
for commercial photo finishers.

00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:54.270
It's the ideal rapid photofinishing
paper, this was sold, yes,

00:15:54.270 --> 00:15:57.460
you could buy sheets but more
commonly you would buy roles

00:15:57.460 --> 00:15:58.760
of this stuff.

00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:03.870
It was about five times
less expensive than Divalux

00:16:03.870 --> 00:16:10.620
and so what you have here is
this the two ends of the spectrum

00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:13.090
for that particular
year of Divalux paper...

00:16:13.090 --> 00:16:15.660
of gaveric papers, you know.

00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:20.570
This for one segment of the market
and for one very specific sort

00:16:20.570 --> 00:16:25.800
of expressive intent and
this on the opposite.

00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:31.210
And you know, I like to think
about numbers I guess but I also

00:16:31.210 --> 00:16:35.100
like to think about words
and semantic meaning.

00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:40.470
And so here are the two paper
side-by-side, two advertisements

00:16:40.470 --> 00:16:45.260
from the period and I'm
just overlay some words

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:50.560
and in these words I think convey
the meaning of the, you know,

00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:53.550
the inside of that
glyph, the small one is

00:16:53.550 --> 00:16:57.760
when that glyph is really small and
tight and centered in the focus.

00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:05.620 position:56%
You're talking about an object that
speaks objectively, it's a document,

00:17:05.620 --> 00:17:10.020
it's real and you can compare
like this list of words, you know,

00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:13.330
I like some of these things,
it's cerebral, you know,

00:17:13.330 --> 00:17:17.660
to and I made all this
up by the way.

00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:22.420
This is not like, you know, any
sort of orthodoxy here, I mean,

00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:24.820
you can make up your own.

00:17:24.820 --> 00:17:34.120 position:56%
So for objective purposes, to convey
information versus subjective,

00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:37.440
to convey a high level
of discernment,

00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:40.350
this is for straight
photography, this is more skewed,

00:17:40.350 --> 00:17:42.410
this is functionalist,
this indulgent,

00:17:42.410 --> 00:17:44.490
this is utilitarian, this is art.

00:17:44.490 --> 00:17:47.090
You know, you can kind of
actually when you think

00:17:47.090 --> 00:17:49.920
about expressive dimensions
of photographic paper,

00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:51.930
you can actually think
about expressive dimensions

00:17:51.930 --> 00:17:54.070
of like a chair, you know.

00:17:54.070 --> 00:17:58.430
I think, you know, I could go to
work for IKEA now with this and put

00:17:58.430 --> 00:18:02.630
like this into their catalog like,
where do you fall on the expressive

00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:06.720
versus functional dimension,
you know, for this chair

00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:08.020
or this picture whatever.

00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:12.420
This is very functional,
utilitarian, it's straight,

00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:15.550
it's not skewed, it's
utilitarian, it's not art;

00:18:15.550 --> 00:18:18.610 position:56%
I don't know about cerebral, anyway.

00:18:18.610 --> 00:18:23.230
So you get the point, right?

00:18:23.230 --> 00:18:27.280
I just happened to be
running around yesterday

00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:32.440
and came upon Kathy
Mitty's project here

00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:37.570 position:56%
and she's got this great project and
she's working with Adrian Lundgren

00:18:37.570 --> 00:18:47.120
on it to look at technical manuals
and catalog photographs, you know.

00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:50.580
Actual photographs to get
put into these manuals

00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:53.030
and it's an amazing project
and it's just, you know,

00:18:53.030 --> 00:18:58.070
explodes the idea of,
well, it explodes,

00:18:58.070 --> 00:19:03.140
it really renders very clear how
diverse the medium is and how,

00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:06.990
you know, you think of
these categories of prints,

00:19:06.990 --> 00:19:10.370
an albumin print, platinum printing
and yes that's really a good basis

00:19:10.370 --> 00:19:13.550
for understanding the medium
but you don't know anything

00:19:13.550 --> 00:19:17.930
until you've seen this amazing,
you know, real-time invention

00:19:17.930 --> 00:19:19.890
of these different
processes, anyway.

00:19:19.890 --> 00:19:24.760 position:56%
So this caught my eye and, you know,

00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:29.310
what textured thin textured
surface combination do you prefer

00:19:29.310 --> 00:19:33.220
and so it's, you know, I kind
of did make some other stuff up,

00:19:33.220 --> 00:19:37.270
but a lot of it really comes right
straight out of the vocabulary,

00:19:37.270 --> 00:19:40.370
the language of the medium
and I love this, you know.

00:19:40.370 --> 00:19:42.840
At different times with different
jobs your preference may run

00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:45.710
to this base, that
base, this texture,

00:19:45.710 --> 00:19:47.740
that texture, that
gloss, this gloss.

00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:50.310
Shuffle and reshuffle
these characteristics

00:19:50.310 --> 00:19:53.660
into every desirable
combination [inaudible] you know,

00:19:53.660 --> 00:19:56.710
first okay blah blah, you know,

00:19:56.710 --> 00:20:00.220
okay and then it's really
great, you know, range.

00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:05.260
So, you know, these things
worked in combination

00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:09.620
for very specific purposes
and intentions

00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:14.210 position:56%
that photographers were trying to
convey and the manufacturers knew it

00:20:14.210 --> 00:20:15.510
and the photographer's knew it.

00:20:15.510 --> 00:20:23.110
Just back to this project
at MOMA for a second.

00:20:23.110 --> 00:20:32.210
How can we, you know, the idea here
is to characterize papers, yes,

00:20:32.210 --> 00:20:37.400
but to what end and I'm always
trying to think of, well, you know,

00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:43.230
what is sort of utilitarian
end of this kind of this work.

00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:48.390
And so this was one proof of
concept that we were working on.

00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:51.500
Here are MOMA prints
on the left column.

00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:54.530
So these are MOMA prints
and they're both to scale.

00:20:54.530 --> 00:21:00.310
On the right is our prints at the
Museum of fine arts in Houston.

00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:05.570
And what we're doing is,
what I was doing is comparing

00:21:05.570 --> 00:21:09.840
across these collections the
materials of the photographer

00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:12.350
across these two different
collections

00:21:12.350 --> 00:21:14.810
and the prints were
never side-by-side.

00:21:14.810 --> 00:21:20.150
We just went and we measured the
four expressive dimensions to see

00:21:20.150 --> 00:21:23.330
if we could get some
information out.

00:21:23.330 --> 00:21:28.160
And so here's the Lerski again on
the left and here is its glyph,

00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:34.430
it's thumbprint and on the right
is the MFA Lerski and we see based

00:21:34.430 --> 00:21:38.240
on the measurements that, you know,
it's very similar in terms of gloss

00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:41.480
for sure and it's similar
in terms of base color

00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:45.470 position:56%
but it's got a much smoother texture

00:21:45.470 --> 00:21:48.330
and is actually really
a thick paper.

00:21:48.330 --> 00:21:49.630
So who knows?

00:21:49.630 --> 00:21:52.140
We don't know if this may
be, you know, they were made

00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:54.850
at different times
but what we do know is

00:21:54.850 --> 00:21:57.950
that the materials are
fundamentally different

00:21:57.950 --> 00:22:02.920
across these two identical
looking images.

00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:08.450
Same with this, I mean it's
very different conception

00:22:08.450 --> 00:22:11.970
from that negative, very different
composition from that negative

00:22:11.970 --> 00:22:16.670
and fundamentally a
very different paper.

00:22:16.670 --> 00:22:20.710 position:56%
And this one is kind of the opposite
case, it's very different in terms

00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:23.380
of its composition, its conception

00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:27.590
but on an identical
photographic paper

00:22:27.590 --> 00:22:30.610
so maybe these two
share a provenance.

00:22:30.610 --> 00:22:34.100
So again if you know
the provenance of one

00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:38.090
of these maybe you can actually
when it was made, how it was made,

00:22:38.090 --> 00:22:41.700
why it was made, maybe
you can actually apply it

00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:43.590
to this object as well.

00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:48.880 position:56%
So this starts to open up, you know,
some other avenues of scholarship

00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:54.310
when it comes to understanding and
contextualizing photographic papers

00:22:54.310 --> 00:22:57.040
or photographs not just
photographic papers,

00:22:57.040 --> 00:23:01.900
photographs that's
what I'm talking about.

00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:09.720
We're doing a great project now on
Moholy photograms with my friends

00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:13.900
and colleagues at the Art Institute
- Silvi Penichau and Christel Low.

00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:19.760 position:56%
And so we're looking at about 250
photograms in different collections.

00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:23.050
I think that's the right
number and, you know,

00:23:23.050 --> 00:23:26.060
it's really fascinating
in terms of potential.

00:23:26.060 --> 00:23:32.060
When you go from this to this,
these are all the different glyphs

00:23:32.060 --> 00:23:37.000
for the collection and you
know, if you're like me,

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:40.180
you want to start sorting
these right away.

00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:42.950
Let's figure out what's the same
ones, what's the different ones,

00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:45.980
what's going on and so
that's the next, you know,

00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:47.990 position:56%
when I come back here in four years.

00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:53.200
The last talk I gave you was
four years ago I think, you know,

00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:57.080
I'll have some statistical methods
and some visualization tools

00:23:57.080 --> 00:23:58.440
to actually sort this out.

00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:01.950
In fact, I hope to have
the statistics, you know,

00:24:01.950 --> 00:24:05.960 position:56%
the ways to model this statistically
figured out really soon,

00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:07.310
that's kind of the next step

00:24:07.310 --> 00:24:10.750
on this work is how does
these things cluster,

00:24:10.750 --> 00:24:14.670
and what is that tell us
about Moholy's approach

00:24:14.670 --> 00:24:21.120
at different time periods
of his career if anything,

00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:23.910
I think it will actually
reveal a lot.

00:24:23.910 --> 00:24:29.450
And so the expressive
dimensions are, you know,

00:24:29.450 --> 00:24:32.560
I'm talking about these four
expressive dimensions and I think

00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:34.140
of course there are many more.

00:24:34.140 --> 00:24:40.150
You can add different axes to that
glyph depending on what you need.

00:24:40.150 --> 00:24:44.360
Here's a proposed, you know,
additional axis perhaps.

00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:48.930 position:56%
We went back, this was work that
Jennifer McGlychi [assumed spelling]

00:24:48.930 --> 00:24:54.040
who was in my studio for a number
years did and she just went back

00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:59.340
to the collection and a lot
of manufacturer sample books

00:24:59.340 --> 00:25:03.360
and price lists and
encyclopedias and just pulled

00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:08.520
out what dimensions
photographic paper was sold in

00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:11.770
and it's a huge diversity
of dimensions, big,

00:25:11.770 --> 00:25:13.240
small all over the place.

00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:16.230
But if you boil it all down
it comes out I think this adds

00:25:16.230 --> 00:25:19.690
up to what is a set up to fifty
back to Math, Andrew [inaudible].

00:25:19.690 --> 00:25:26.280
Fifty, what is this, thirty nine
plus fifty is eighty nine, okay.

00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:30.940
Almost ninety percent of the
things that we looked at boiled

00:25:30.940 --> 00:25:35.340
down to these five different
aspect ratios which I think,

00:25:35.340 --> 00:25:38.750 position:56%
this is fascinating and I don't
know what this tells us about humans

00:25:38.750 --> 00:25:40.480
and aesthetics and all of that.

00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:44.680
But it's amazing that the
four, three ratio was used

00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:47.620
as a whole plate daguerreotype
but also for the iPad,

00:25:47.620 --> 00:25:52.110
I mean Steve Jobs could make the
iPad any dimensions he wanted to

00:25:52.110 --> 00:25:56.150
but why did he do four, three
and you know, how did that work?

00:25:56.150 --> 00:25:59.180 position:56%
Maybe because he watched a lot of TV
or something I don't know, you know,

00:25:59.180 --> 00:26:04.670
because it was LA TV as well
was the four, three dimension.

00:26:04.670 --> 00:26:09.440 position:56%
Who knows, but we can put this
information to work as well in terms

00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:12.910
of interpreting photography or
photographs or photographers.

00:26:12.910 --> 00:26:16.570
Here's an example, on the
left again these are to scale,

00:26:16.570 --> 00:26:20.740
on the left is the Man Ray, Ray
graph from 1924; on the right,

00:26:20.740 --> 00:26:23.810
a Moholy from around
the same period.

00:26:23.810 --> 00:26:30.770
Just measure it and I measured
a bunch, I probably measured,

00:26:30.770 --> 00:26:38.260
not sure now, maybe forty,
thirty Man Ray, Ray graphs

00:26:38.260 --> 00:26:43.000
and about forty four percent
come out to the standard sizes,

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:44.710
okay, you know, whatever.

00:26:44.710 --> 00:26:46.010
But if you look at Moholy,

00:26:46.010 --> 00:26:49.220
about ninty percent are
these standard sizes

00:26:49.220 --> 00:26:54.060
and so the bookmaking
photograms around the same period

00:26:54.060 --> 00:26:56.720
but right away we can see instantly

00:26:56.720 --> 00:27:00.300
from this very simple
metric their methodologies

00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:02.830
and their intentions were
incredibly different.

00:27:02.830 --> 00:27:07.270
Moholy is composing to
the sheet, you know,

00:27:07.270 --> 00:27:10.340
photograms are really a
performance piece right,

00:27:10.340 --> 00:27:12.530
there you placing objects,
you putting on the [inaudible]

00:27:12.530 --> 00:27:14.900
and it's a record of
that performance.

00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:18.890
From Moholy, the performance
is finished when it goes

00:27:18.890 --> 00:27:21.580
into the developer and the
printers' drive, that's it.

00:27:21.580 --> 00:27:26.580
For Man Ray, most of
the time, the final part

00:27:26.580 --> 00:27:31.540
of the performance is he's
trimming the print and we know this

00:27:31.540 --> 00:27:34.680
because they're nonstandard
sizes, they don't fit

00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:38.610
into these standard sizes,
the standard aspect ratios.

00:27:38.610 --> 00:27:43.850
And so Man Ray is trimming,
he's refining that vision,

00:27:43.850 --> 00:27:46.670
he's making a refinement
to that performance

00:27:46.670 --> 00:27:50.790 position:56%
as his last before he it's finished.

00:27:50.790 --> 00:27:59.060 position:56%
I get some criticism, you know,
well, I don't no maybe it's just all

00:27:59.060 --> 00:28:05.080
in my head, sometimes, I have
a lot of things that way,

00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:07.880
you know, somewhat paranoid.

00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:14.140
I have some trouble talking to
curators about this at times

00:28:14.140 --> 00:28:18.580
because they think, I don't know,
maybe I'm misreading the situation

00:28:18.580 --> 00:28:21.750
but they thinking that this is
just really a formalist exercise

00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:27.150
where it's devoid of
context and what I'm trying

00:28:27.150 --> 00:28:31.060
to say here is it's
all about context.

00:28:31.060 --> 00:28:36.030
If I don't have the universe
to compare the measurements to,

00:28:36.030 --> 00:28:38.730
then the measurements
mean very little.

00:28:38.730 --> 00:28:42.650
It's always, the measurements
are always in comparison

00:28:42.650 --> 00:28:51.310
to a larger body of numbers
that represent the media.

00:28:51.310 --> 00:28:55.220
So to me it's all about context
but I think I can maybe make

00:28:55.220 --> 00:28:58.760
that point better talking about
a project that I'm working

00:28:58.760 --> 00:29:03.460
on at the Guggenheim right now
looking at Mapplethorpe prints

00:29:03.460 --> 00:29:06.320
and we're specifically
looking at the prints,

00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:12.040
the platinum palladium prints made
in the later years of his life.

00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:18.390
This is one of those
prints made in 1988.

00:29:18.390 --> 00:29:24.780
Mapplethorpe dies in 89, he's
diagnosed with AIDS in 86

00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:32.960 position:56%
and if you didn't know that contexts
you could perceive something is

00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:36.400
up just by looking
at this data, okay?

00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:38.180
And so here's that
Mapplethorpe print

00:29:38.180 --> 00:29:41.480
and all this really is is
every print that we've looked

00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:48.680
at going horizontally and then
the same prints going vertically

00:29:48.680 --> 00:29:54.560
and so we're comparing each, the
texture of each print to each other

00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:57.610
and that's what this
little chart is all about.

00:29:57.610 --> 00:29:59.380
We don't need to know
exactly what's going

00:29:59.380 --> 00:30:03.550
on here except what you do need
to notice or what I would like you

00:30:03.550 --> 00:30:07.300
to notice is we've got two
really distinct clusters

00:30:07.300 --> 00:30:11.890
and so the prints themselves
are giving you context.

00:30:11.890 --> 00:30:17.660
The measurements made from the
prints themselves suffice something

00:30:17.660 --> 00:30:24.130
is going on in 1986,
this breakpoint here.

00:30:24.130 --> 00:30:28.730
And, you know, what's happening
and I've got the data to support it

00:30:28.730 --> 00:30:31.410
and make him, I can talk
more about it, you know,

00:30:31.410 --> 00:30:33.370
question answer but you know.

00:30:33.370 --> 00:30:40.650
He's making actually substantially
more expressive photographs

00:30:40.650 --> 00:30:44.220
after 1986 and so the
interpretation,

00:30:44.220 --> 00:30:47.350
I think many interpretations
could be supported here,

00:30:47.350 --> 00:30:52.040
but of course if you combine
that with the image and the fact

00:30:52.040 --> 00:30:56.460
that as platinum and palladium
very permanent noble metals.

00:30:56.460 --> 00:31:00.060
You know, he's thinking
about legacy, you know,

00:31:00.060 --> 00:31:06.370
the formal frontal composition
but yeah but look at the paper

00:31:06.370 --> 00:31:08.880
with this wild ductile edge.

00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:14.240
The paper I'm sure Mapplethorpe
had no idea but the paper is

00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:19.810
about if I get it right it's
like eighty five percent cotton

00:31:19.810 --> 00:31:21.840
and about fifteen percent linen.

00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:27.530
It's made by the Ashes Mill; one
of the oldest mills founded in 1492

00:31:27.530 --> 00:31:32.450
as a matter of fact, funny
how I can remember that.

00:31:32.450 --> 00:31:38.970
It's incredibly traditional paper;
it's got this amazing texture.

00:31:38.970 --> 00:31:43.320
Back to the fibers for a second,
I didn't finish that point.

00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:49.120
That fiber composition is more of
a traditional fiber composition

00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:57.520
from it of a sheet made in the
18th, 17th century, you know,

00:31:57.520 --> 00:32:02.720
I think it's got more of this print
has probably more in common with,

00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:13.450 position:56%
you know, a Dürer Van Stieglitz
and it goes beyond the possibilities

00:32:13.450 --> 00:32:17.950
of silver gelatin, it's way beyond.

00:32:17.950 --> 00:32:23.740
So he's pushing past all of that
and to me I think that's profound.

00:32:23.740 --> 00:32:29.740
I think that's incredibly useful
information to be able to document

00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:35.100
that and to actually be able
to effectively communicate that

00:32:35.100 --> 00:32:42.160 position:56%
and to share that which is what this
characterization agenda is really

00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:43.460
all about.

00:32:43.460 --> 00:32:51.280
It's giving us tools to
communicate the intrinsic value

00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:54.360
of the materials of
the photographer.

00:32:54.360 --> 00:32:59.230
And so that's all I have and I
would love to take some questions

00:32:59.230 --> 00:33:02.510
and thanks for your attention.

00:33:02.510 --> 00:33:12.040
[ Audience Clapping ]

00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:13.340
Yeah. Please.

00:33:13.340 --> 00:33:17.420
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] terminology and
tone, paper tones [inaudible] give

00:33:17.420 --> 00:33:25.190
that a lot and how you
describe paper tone

00:33:25.190 --> 00:33:29.150
and how you measure paper
tone and I'm curious

00:33:29.150 --> 00:33:33.790
about your idea [inaudible].

00:33:33.790 --> 00:33:35.090
&gt;&gt; Paul Messier: Yeah

00:33:35.090 --> 00:33:36.390
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] influences.

00:33:36.390 --> 00:33:37.690
&gt;&gt; Paul Messier: Great.

00:33:37.690 --> 00:33:39.380
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] that affect your
classification [inaudible].

00:33:39.380 --> 00:33:43.890
&gt;&gt; Paul Messier: So, yeah, okay,
so I am repeating the question

00:33:43.890 --> 00:33:47.030
for because it is webcast, right?

00:33:47.030 --> 00:33:48.330
Yeah, okay.

00:33:48.330 --> 00:33:50.170
So let me see if I
got the summary right.

00:33:50.170 --> 00:33:53.630
So when paper ages it yellows.

00:33:53.630 --> 00:33:57.430
And so how does that impact
the classification scheme

00:33:57.430 --> 00:34:02.390
and that's a really good question
and, you know, that questions

00:34:02.390 --> 00:34:06.310
like that used to bother me
a lot because it's like "Ugh,

00:34:06.310 --> 00:34:08.950
that wrecks everything", you
know, because we never know

00:34:08.950 --> 00:34:14.440
like what it was originally and now
it's this but now I just feel go

00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:20.500
with it because this was A,
there's nothing I can do about it

00:34:20.500 --> 00:34:24.280
but be I think it's information and
I think it's fascinating to think

00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:28.340
about photographs and
we all know this,

00:34:28.340 --> 00:34:33.710
we all know this becoming
more expressive as they age.

00:34:33.710 --> 00:34:39.350
I mean sometimes they don't age in
an expressive way but as, you know,

00:34:39.350 --> 00:34:48.230
as a Stieglitz, as a Madadi gains
tone, gains some paper tone,

00:34:48.230 --> 00:34:50.910
it becomes this more
expressive object.

00:34:50.910 --> 00:34:54.330
And so I just don't, I just try
not to get in the way of that

00:34:54.330 --> 00:35:00.570
and I just try to document
that but yeah I mean it's,

00:35:00.570 --> 00:35:06.400
I could really dwell on that and
it could be a real conceptual flaw.

00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:11.290
If you think about gloss, gloss
is also one of those dimensions

00:35:11.290 --> 00:35:14.290
that can change fora photographic
paper specially depending

00:35:14.290 --> 00:35:16.520
on treatment.

00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:23.050
Treatment completely alters the
color as well but, you know,

00:35:23.050 --> 00:35:26.090
texture we've done some
experiments in texture really seems

00:35:26.090 --> 00:35:28.690
to hold up and is pretty robust.

00:35:28.690 --> 00:35:34.620
And thickness really holds up too
over time, that's pretty robust

00:35:34.620 --> 00:35:38.500
and so when it comes to this sort
of the statistical analysis of all

00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:44.100
of these glyphs, I'm thinking
of making kind of set points

00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:48.020
for things that don't tend to move.

00:35:48.020 --> 00:35:52.720
So in giving them additional
weight in the statistic in any sort

00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:56.280
of future statistical model,
does that makes sense?

00:35:56.280 --> 00:36:00.870
Those becomes sort of the, you
know, keystones when it comes to,

00:36:00.870 --> 00:36:05.130
that are first considered
for clustering, yeah.

00:36:05.130 --> 00:36:06.430
Please.

00:36:06.430 --> 00:36:12.020
&gt;&gt; You talk about looking at
paper in a photographic context

00:36:12.020 --> 00:36:17.600
in comparison say [inaudible]
and other kind of print making.

00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:24.280
Are there similar analysis or
descriptions [inaudible] out there.

00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:29.200
&gt;&gt; Paul Messier: So the question is
are there similar characterization

00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:34.480
model set up for other printmaking
media like [inaudible] prints,

00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:36.590
lithographs and all of that.

00:36:36.590 --> 00:36:42.110 position:56%
I mean not that I know of but I mean
after today, I'm inviting everyone

00:36:42.110 --> 00:36:47.850
up there to like go back and
think about, you know, your media

00:36:47.850 --> 00:36:51.890
and maybe think about it in
terms of expressive dimensions.

00:36:51.890 --> 00:36:56.350
I think that model could work,
I gave this talk or a version

00:36:56.350 --> 00:36:59.950
of this talk at the
Reichs Museum last year

00:36:59.950 --> 00:37:03.510
and a painting's conservator
came up to me afterwards

00:37:03.510 --> 00:37:07.140
and said panel paintings I
think this will work great

00:37:07.140 --> 00:37:08.440
on panel paintings.

00:37:08.440 --> 00:37:10.410
And frankly I have no idea
how you would make that work

00:37:10.410 --> 00:37:15.190
on panel paintings but she
did and I think that's awesome

00:37:15.190 --> 00:37:19.380
like I said I think you could do
it for, you know, IKEA chairs,

00:37:19.380 --> 00:37:22.770
I think you could do it
for all kinds of stuff.

00:37:22.770 --> 00:37:27.990
So yeah, it would make a lot
of sense to start looking

00:37:27.990 --> 00:37:33.800
at printmaking, traditional
printmaking media

00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:35.800
and actually that's
kind of something

00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:37.990
that is very interesting to me.

00:37:37.990 --> 00:37:44.060
Is putting photography in a
larger context of, you know,

00:37:44.060 --> 00:37:46.750
photography didn't
come out of the ether.

00:37:46.750 --> 00:37:51.590
Photography is a graphic arts
medium and putting it into context

00:37:51.590 --> 00:37:57.850
with more traditional printmaking
media is a very appealing notion.

00:37:57.850 --> 00:37:59.530
Please, yeah.

00:37:59.530 --> 00:38:04.000
&gt;&gt; I really appreciate how you've
applied this system thinking

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:09.100
to analysis of the characteristics
[inaudible] photographs.

00:38:09.100 --> 00:38:16.890
I actually have come up with
the characterisation scheme

00:38:16.890 --> 00:38:18.450
for [inaudible].

00:38:18.450 --> 00:38:22.470 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Paul Messier: Oh fantastic, okay.

00:38:22.470 --> 00:38:26.220
&gt;&gt; I can [inaudible]
and [inaudible].

00:38:27.610 --> 00:38:35.000
My question is so when you have
characterized these artists' print,

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:37.690
do you find in their writings

00:38:37.690 --> 00:38:42.090
that their writings actually
corroborates your aesthetics

00:38:42.090 --> 00:38:45.790
interpretation on the
data you have been able

00:38:45.790 --> 00:38:48.030
to derive from your analysis?

00:38:48.030 --> 00:38:49.810
&gt;&gt; Paul Messier: Okay,
so the question is,

00:38:49.810 --> 00:38:59.460 position:56%
is there documentary evidence within
an artist journals or writings that,

00:38:59.460 --> 00:39:02.950
tell me if I'm right
here, that will correlate.

00:39:02.950 --> 00:39:04.250
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:39:04.250 --> 00:39:06.060
&gt;&gt; Paul Messier: With
the interpretation

00:39:06.060 --> 00:39:10.400
or the characterization
scheme that I'm coming up with

00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:14.030
and the short answer to
that is I don't know.

00:39:14.030 --> 00:39:15.860
I've not really gone down that road

00:39:15.860 --> 00:39:20.310 position:56%
and I think that's actually a really
important, a really important thing

00:39:20.310 --> 00:39:24.680
to do actually, you know, yeah.

00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:28.400
It gives me some ideas
actually, yeah,

00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:29.700
that would be a valuable thing.

00:39:29.700 --> 00:39:31.380
Is that something that
you've been able to do

00:39:31.380 --> 00:39:37.440
like compare what an
artist is, you know,

00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:41.450
saying about their work
in what you're finding?

00:39:41.450 --> 00:39:45.810
&gt;&gt; With regards to the
printmakers who made wood cuts,

00:39:45.810 --> 00:39:49.470
they didn't really write
about their aesthetics.

00:39:49.470 --> 00:39:59.440
They are a couple of sources that
talk about how to make wood cuts

00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:04.640
but in terms of the final
characteristics and differentiation

00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:09.270
of specific workshops and
your outputs [inaudible]

00:40:09.270 --> 00:40:10.570
at that time [inaudible].

00:40:10.570 --> 00:40:12.100
&gt;&gt; Paul Messier: Yeah,
is not a lot of.

00:40:12.100 --> 00:40:14.160
&gt;&gt; Paul Messier: They
weren't writing.

00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:17.650 position:56%
&gt;&gt; About their aesthetic [inaudible]

00:40:17.650 --> 00:40:18.950
&gt;&gt; Paul Messier: Yeah.

00:40:18.950 --> 00:40:21.070
&gt;&gt; In that way.

00:40:21.070 --> 00:40:22.370
&gt;&gt; Paul Messier: Can I?

00:40:22.370 --> 00:40:23.670
&gt;&gt; Unfortunately, no.

00:40:23.670 --> 00:40:24.970
&gt;&gt; Paul Messier: Yeah.

00:40:24.970 --> 00:40:26.420 position:56%
&gt;&gt; But I was just wondering if there
is a line between your [inaudible].

00:40:26.420 --> 00:40:29.100
&gt;&gt; Paul Messier: I'm sure
there is a line, well,

00:40:29.100 --> 00:40:33.040
lines up in some instances and
supports everything I'm doing

00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:38.840
and I'm sure that there is like a
lot that contradict it entirely,

00:40:38.840 --> 00:40:40.890
you know, if I started looking.

00:40:40.890 --> 00:40:49.980
I am sure it doesn't, it's probably
not as tidy a scenario, you know.

00:40:49.980 --> 00:40:54.120 position:56%
I mean it's funny and I mean I don't
know if this goes to your point but,

00:40:54.120 --> 00:40:59.470
you know, I'm talking about papers
here and I'm not really and I'm.

00:40:59.470 --> 00:41:03.420
So I just want, let's see,
what am I trying to say?

00:41:03.420 --> 00:41:08.200
Hmm, I mean you can make
an expressive photograph

00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:11.380
on a non-expressive paper,
you know what I mean?

00:41:11.380 --> 00:41:14.940
And so that can be part of
the artistic intent as well.

00:41:14.940 --> 00:41:17.320
So I'm thinking like a
Bressei a [inaudible].

00:41:17.320 --> 00:41:23.500
I saw a beautiful Bressei at
the Art Institute last week.

00:41:23.500 --> 00:41:27.580
It's, you know, you
can lose yourself

00:41:27.580 --> 00:41:31.540
in the deep inky amazing
blacks of a Bressei,

00:41:31.540 --> 00:41:34.230
and he's photographing
Paris at night primarily

00:41:34.230 --> 00:41:38.460 position:56%
and he's using a very non-expressive
paper in a very expressive way

00:41:38.460 --> 00:41:40.740
and it's highly ferrotyped.

00:41:40.740 --> 00:41:45.030
The optical saturation of those
blacks is amazing, they're thin,

00:41:45.030 --> 00:41:51.970
you know, it's and it's almost,
it kind of reveals the conceit

00:41:51.970 --> 00:41:54.040
of a surrealist or a dotteist

00:41:54.040 --> 00:41:59.860 position:56%
or a surrealist primarily photograph
is the conceit is they're using

00:41:59.860 --> 00:42:04.560
up a non-expressive paper
to convey information.

00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:07.130
But it's of a skewed reality

00:42:07.130 --> 00:42:11.680
and if they used expressive
paper would be too interpretive

00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:15.480
and it would be useless
but what's communicated

00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:21.260 position:56%
by the paper is this is information,
subliminal, you know, this is what,

00:42:21.260 --> 00:42:27.120
this is information, this is real
world and it's the dream work.

00:42:27.120 --> 00:42:31.550
So, you know, I think a lot
about that those kinds of things

00:42:31.550 --> 00:42:36.120
and I probably should start
integrating more to round that out,

00:42:36.120 --> 00:42:39.620
starting integrating more about
what photographers are thinking

00:42:39.620 --> 00:42:41.540
and saying and talking
about their work.

00:42:41.540 --> 00:42:45.960
&gt;&gt; I think it would be again a
fascinating branch of your study

00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:50.060
but your work is just absolute
[inaudible] classifications

00:42:50.060 --> 00:42:55.630 position:56%
for all kinds of graphic work and
analyzing all kinds of graphic work.

00:42:55.630 --> 00:42:57.610
&gt;&gt; Paul Messier: Great
and not just IKEA chairs.

00:42:57.610 --> 00:42:59.260
Yeah.

00:42:59.260 --> 00:43:06.680 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Andrew Robb: Just want to come
in to follow up on [inaudible] Okay.

00:43:06.680 --> 00:43:07.980
&gt;&gt; Andrew Robb: This is to say,

00:43:07.980 --> 00:43:11.350
I think photographers are often
describing papers that they like,

00:43:11.350 --> 00:43:14.360
or they're sad, if they don't
have that paper anymore, you know,

00:43:14.360 --> 00:43:15.750
often in their writing but.

00:43:15.750 --> 00:43:17.050
&gt;&gt; Paul Messier: Yeah, yeah.

00:43:17.050 --> 00:43:20.220 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Andrew Robb: Oh I really like the
paper but they can't get in anymore

00:43:20.220 --> 00:43:23.480
and what you're doing in a way is
figuring out a way to objectify

00:43:23.480 --> 00:43:25.280
that description so
when they say that.

00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:26.580
&gt;&gt; Paul Messier: Yeah

00:43:26.580 --> 00:43:27.880
&gt;&gt; Andrew Robb: that what they need

00:43:27.880 --> 00:43:29.180
&gt;&gt; Paul Messier: Yeah, yeah.

00:43:29.180 --> 00:43:30.480
&gt;&gt; Andrew Robb: and they
say that this is the model

00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:33.260
to say well there sad about this
kind of paper which is very hard

00:43:33.260 --> 00:43:37.190 position:56%
to know exactly what they're talking
about, you kind of know little bit

00:43:37.190 --> 00:43:42.520
but this is a way to make that put
it in context to say what do you,

00:43:42.520 --> 00:43:45.620
like why are they sad
like you, they like that.

00:43:45.620 --> 00:43:46.920
&gt;&gt; Paul Messier: Yeah.

00:43:46.920 --> 00:43:48.220
&gt;&gt; Andrew Robb: So that.

00:43:48.220 --> 00:43:49.520
&gt;&gt; Paul Messier: Yeah.

00:43:49.520 --> 00:43:50.820
&gt;&gt; Andrew Robb: The time
back, that's the way

00:43:50.820 --> 00:43:52.830
that often they are viewing
that doing that in many cases,

00:43:52.830 --> 00:43:55.440
it's an aside, it's
not, you know, a tome.

00:43:55.440 --> 00:43:59.200
But this is the way to unravel
what they're getting at.

00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:03.850
And I think that would be, you'll
find examples of that, you know,

00:44:03.850 --> 00:44:07.790
in a way [inaudible] doctors
had in articles they write

00:44:07.790 --> 00:44:09.570
but it might be in a
more shorthand way.

00:44:09.570 --> 00:44:16.310
It might not be in the using
that terminology that will exist.

00:44:16.310 --> 00:44:22.300
&gt;&gt; Paul Messier: Yeah, so please,
we will go left to right, okay?

00:44:22.300 --> 00:44:26.870
Well, my left.

00:44:26.870 --> 00:44:35.300
&gt;&gt; This is a followup
to Andrew's question

00:44:35.300 --> 00:44:41.530
so about your paper library.

00:44:41.530 --> 00:44:51.170
Have you been, you know,
collecting, I know that a lot

00:44:51.170 --> 00:44:56.780
of papers recently have just
did start up in the last,

00:44:56.780 --> 00:45:02.280
you know, five to ten years.

00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:03.580
&gt;&gt; Paul Messier: Yeah.

00:45:03.580 --> 00:45:04.880
Yeah.

00:45:04.880 --> 00:45:07.440
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] papers are no longer
available so have you been kind

00:45:07.440 --> 00:45:11.180
of collecting samples of this
at your library so that you have

00:45:11.180 --> 00:45:12.570
that as, you know, a dictionary

00:45:12.570 --> 00:45:14.240
for [inaudible]the
lack of a better word.

00:45:14.240 --> 00:45:17.000
&gt;&gt; Catalog or pictures [inaudible]
artists you know, practicing now

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:23.790 position:56%
or within the last twenty years, in
fifty years when we go back and look

00:45:23.790 --> 00:45:27.080
at their work so that we have
a standard to compare them.

00:45:27.080 --> 00:45:32.620
&gt;&gt; Paul Messier: Yeah, so
the question to summarize is

00:45:32.620 --> 00:45:38.340
in my collecting contemporary
black and white materials

00:45:38.340 --> 00:45:41.310
within the context of
the gradual disappearance

00:45:41.310 --> 00:45:44.090
of the medium, I guess instead of.

00:45:44.090 --> 00:45:45.390
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:45:45.390 --> 00:45:46.690
&gt;&gt; Paul Messier: Fair
summary something like that.

00:45:46.690 --> 00:45:51.450
You know and the answer is yes but
I'm, you know, it's really, yeah,

00:45:51.450 --> 00:45:59.410 position:56%
I mean the answer is yes but as I'm
not getting everything and it's kind

00:45:59.410 --> 00:46:04.850
of frustrating, and one of the
projects that I would really

00:46:04.850 --> 00:46:11.880
like to do is to to figure
out a way to make the catalog

00:46:11.880 --> 00:46:14.820 position:56%
and the collection much more
accessible in hopes of bringing out,

00:46:14.820 --> 00:46:18.330
surfacing other collections.

00:46:18.330 --> 00:46:23.270
And maybe giving sending the
message out that hey, you know,

00:46:23.270 --> 00:46:29.020
there's a crazy guy up at
Yale who will take this stuff,

00:46:29.020 --> 00:46:34.080
don't throw it away, you
know, when you're going.

00:46:34.080 --> 00:46:37.390
So, yeah, I mean it's
kind of frustrating

00:46:37.390 --> 00:46:43.450
because it is just slipping through
our fingers but I mean, you know,

00:46:43.450 --> 00:46:46.040
the fundamental purpose

00:46:46.040 --> 00:46:50.380
of the collection always
was, yes, to make a data set.

00:46:50.380 --> 00:46:59.160
I have never had like sort of
antiquarian sort of interests,

00:46:59.160 --> 00:47:07.530
but then it started to
grow on me and so then.

00:47:07.530 --> 00:47:13.390
So now it's, you know, I
really do feel like maybe

00:47:13.390 --> 00:47:18.810
in the end my biggest contribution
is not any of this stuff.

00:47:18.810 --> 00:47:23.240
It's just buying a lot of
stuff on eBay and cataloging it

00:47:23.240 --> 00:47:26.420
and sticking it in cold storage

00:47:26.420 --> 00:47:30.760
at a major research
university, you know, yeah.

00:47:30.760 --> 00:47:36.070 position:56%
&gt;&gt; It's kind of seems like a natural
match with, you know, archivist

00:47:36.070 --> 00:47:41.460
and librarians to kind of maybe
reach out to some of them and say,

00:47:41.460 --> 00:47:46.350
hey, you know, you work with
the department, and you know,

00:47:46.350 --> 00:47:51.870
your school or your university or
you work with yjos group of artists

00:47:51.870 --> 00:47:55.360
as you see them transition
more and more deep, you know.

00:47:55.360 --> 00:48:00.750
Do you have this and to figure out
someway in collaborating on that.

00:48:00.750 --> 00:48:05.460
I don't know what it will be your,
how that will work but it seems

00:48:05.460 --> 00:48:07.060
like that will be your [inaudible].

00:48:07.060 --> 00:48:08.360
&gt;&gt; Paul Messier: Yeah.

00:48:08.360 --> 00:48:10.440
And so it's just to
summarize that comment.

00:48:10.440 --> 00:48:14.560
I think that's an important
one is, well,

00:48:14.560 --> 00:48:18.530
I don't know I'm not
summarizing you comment.

00:48:18.530 --> 00:48:23.010
I'm making a comment to your
comment, which is, you know,

00:48:23.010 --> 00:48:27.070
absolutely building a
network to collaborate

00:48:27.070 --> 00:48:29.910
and share this kind of information.

00:48:29.910 --> 00:48:38.170
I may think about it, you know,
that's kind of one of my visions

00:48:38.170 --> 00:48:49.640
and one of my ambitions
for the Lens Media Lab is

00:48:49.640 --> 00:48:55.620
to make not just these
glyphs available

00:48:55.620 --> 00:48:58.480
or these statistical methods.

00:48:58.480 --> 00:49:06.700
To make really an interface,
you know, to put it all online

00:49:06.700 --> 00:49:09.880
and to link different
collections together.

00:49:09.880 --> 00:49:20.860
And so when you do, when you have
a print that you want to know more

00:49:20.860 --> 00:49:28.040 position:56%
about that you can at least make a
query about what other materials are

00:49:28.040 --> 00:49:31.300
out there like this
across different artists

00:49:31.300 --> 00:49:32.600
within different time periods.

00:49:32.600 --> 00:49:33.900
Imagine what amazing
and fairly simple tool

00:49:33.900 --> 00:49:35.200 position:56%
to enhance existing scholarship that
would be and what's great about that

00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:36.850
for me as a conservator is it
really pushes forward the relevance

00:49:36.850 --> 00:49:38.150
of materials.

00:49:38.150 --> 00:49:39.450
You know, which sometimes get
lost in the mix when it comes

00:49:39.450 --> 00:49:40.750
to interpreting photographs.

00:49:40.750 --> 00:49:42.050
Sorry, yeah.

00:49:42.050 --> 00:49:43.350
&gt;&gt; To follow, I'm amplifying
what Andres is bring up as well,

00:49:43.350 --> 00:49:44.650 position:56%
I was reading about just recently is
about the Art of the book in Europe

00:49:44.650 --> 00:49:45.950
in 1939 [inaudible] 49, published
in 1951 but the sentiment

00:49:45.950 --> 00:49:47.250
in it is still very real
about the politics of choice

00:49:47.250 --> 00:49:48.550
and reviewing what was
able to done in the face

00:49:48.550 --> 00:49:49.930
of incredible destruction
available in terms of machines

00:49:49.930 --> 00:49:51.230
and [inaudible] destroy it.

00:49:51.230 --> 00:49:52.530
So I think for, you know, another
useful layer, it's just my comments

00:49:52.530 --> 00:49:53.830
and not really a question

00:49:53.830 --> 00:49:55.130
but another useful layer is the
transition of the person, the maker

00:49:55.130 --> 00:49:56.430
and where they were in time
what they could do, you know,

00:49:56.430 --> 00:49:57.730
what they [inaudible],
what they are sending.

00:49:57.730 --> 00:49:59.030
&gt;&gt; Paul Messier: Yeah.

00:49:59.030 --> 00:50:00.330
&gt;&gt; Materials to some where
they can be retrieve it.

00:50:00.330 --> 00:50:01.630
I am always impressed you
always state negatively.

00:50:01.630 --> 00:50:02.930
&gt;&gt; Paul Messier: Yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:50:02.930 --> 00:50:04.230 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Because we have to take that out.

00:50:04.230 --> 00:50:05.530
&gt;&gt; Paul Messier: Yeah.

00:50:05.530 --> 00:50:06.830
Yeah, fantastic.

00:50:06.830 --> 00:50:08.130
Yeah, I mean it is, oh sorry Mary.

00:50:08.130 --> 00:50:09.430
Oh I can go, I can talk more.

00:50:09.430 --> 00:50:10.730
&gt;&gt; Did you want to
keep some of the point?

00:50:10.730 --> 00:50:12.030
&gt;&gt; Paul Messier: I can.

00:50:12.030 --> 00:50:13.330
So context, I think was
the underlying point there

00:50:13.330 --> 00:50:14.630 position:56%
and understanding context,
historical context in this instance.

00:50:14.630 --> 00:50:15.930
And we're talking about, you
know, the incredible destruction

00:50:15.930 --> 00:50:17.230
about to be unleashed
on Europe in the 30s

00:50:17.230 --> 00:50:18.530
and how that influenced choice.

00:50:18.530 --> 00:50:19.830
And, you know, you see that very
clearly if you look at Man Ray.

00:50:19.830 --> 00:50:21.430
I think, you know, in
the teens, you know, he,

00:50:21.430 --> 00:50:24.450
I think he was a brilliant artist

00:50:24.450 --> 00:50:28.220
but he couldn't make a pictorialist
photograph to save his life

00:50:28.220 --> 00:50:31.500
and he didn't want to because it
was irrelevant to him, you know.

00:50:31.500 --> 00:50:37.000
After World War I in Dada,
you know, as a Dadaist.

00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:41.930
You couldn't make a beautiful,
it didn't seem relevant,

00:50:41.930 --> 00:50:46.830
that didn't seem, it
had to be manufactured,

00:50:46.830 --> 00:50:52.010
it had to look objective,
it had to, you know,

00:50:52.010 --> 00:50:56.120
back to my synonyms and antonyms.

00:50:56.120 --> 00:50:59.740
It had to be real, it couldn't
be arty or interpreted,

00:50:59.740 --> 00:51:05.920 position:56%
it didn't make sense in that context
anymore after the First World War.

00:51:05.920 --> 00:51:09.260
So, you know, it's
all in there, right?

00:51:09.260 --> 00:51:13.430
&gt;&gt; There's a question.

00:51:13.430 --> 00:51:14.730
&gt;&gt; Paul Messier: There
is a question.

00:51:14.730 --> 00:51:16.030
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:51:16.030 --> 00:51:17.330
&gt;&gt; Paul Messier: From online?

00:51:17.330 --> 00:51:18.630
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:51:18.630 --> 00:51:19.930
&gt;&gt; Paul Messier: Oh fantastic.

00:51:19.930 --> 00:51:21.230
&gt;&gt; Have you considered how
image material affects texture

00:51:21.230 --> 00:51:22.720
with platinum prints?

00:51:22.720 --> 00:51:26.410
&gt;&gt; Paul Messier: Have I considered
whether image material impacts

00:51:26.410 --> 00:51:29.130
texture when it comes
to platinum prints?

00:51:29.130 --> 00:51:32.100 position:56%
So image material I'm guessing would
be the platinum or the palladium,

00:51:32.100 --> 00:51:37.130
that's the stuff that's making the
image and how that impacts texture.

00:51:37.130 --> 00:51:43.280
I think the fair answer is, no,
I think this person has something

00:51:43.280 --> 00:51:46.540
in mind that I don't have in mind

00:51:46.540 --> 00:51:50.870
and I probably should
have in mind to be honest.

00:51:50.870 --> 00:51:54.610
Because, yeah, I mean all these
things combine right, to take,

00:51:54.610 --> 00:51:58.990
to look at something in exclusion
is probably a little artificial

00:51:58.990 --> 00:52:00.290
on my part.

00:52:00.290 --> 00:52:04.240
Is it a follow-up like
you missed the point.

00:52:04.240 --> 00:52:07.040
&gt;&gt; No [inaudible].

00:52:07.040 --> 00:52:08.450
&gt;&gt; Paul Messier: Right.

00:52:08.450 --> 00:52:10.220
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] there is
another question [inaudible].

00:52:10.220 --> 00:52:12.570
&gt;&gt; Paul Messier: Yeah,
sure another, sure.

00:52:12.570 --> 00:52:14.560
&gt;&gt; Could you speak a
bit more about process

00:52:14.560 --> 00:52:16.360
for measuring each algorithm?

00:52:16.360 --> 00:52:18.650
Are texture measurement
taken from [inaudible] given

00:52:18.650 --> 00:52:22.400
that image could mute texture.

00:52:22.400 --> 00:52:25.580
&gt;&gt; Paul Messier: Ah,
image can mute texture.

00:52:25.580 --> 00:52:29.420
Okay so, yeah, I mean, okay.

00:52:29.420 --> 00:52:30.720
So what I've presented is kind

00:52:30.720 --> 00:52:35.160
of a condensed version
of what I'm often doing.

00:52:35.160 --> 00:52:38.520
And so I do make texture
measurements from recto

00:52:38.520 --> 00:52:40.490
and verso often when
I can get access

00:52:40.490 --> 00:52:45.380
to the verso, often you cannot.

00:52:45.380 --> 00:52:47.130
Again, I'm thinking

00:52:47.130 --> 00:52:50.230
about statistics-based
classification schemes even though

00:52:50.230 --> 00:52:53.190
it doesn't exist right
now and hopefully it will.

00:52:53.190 --> 00:52:58.870
Hopefully, I'll be able to
build it, more information

00:52:58.870 --> 00:53:10.040
for the statistical models to chew
on is probably is better right now.

00:53:10.040 --> 00:53:13.050
But, you know, what I'm
really thinking about mostly

00:53:13.050 --> 00:53:18.240
and what I'm really focused on
mostly is artistic intention

00:53:18.240 --> 00:53:23.150
and I'm really thinking about
characteristics that artists

00:53:23.150 --> 00:53:28.180
and we all in this room
can see and perceive.

00:53:28.180 --> 00:53:33.080
So, you know, or having more
information is always better,

00:53:33.080 --> 00:53:39.010
I'm really focused on
perceptual qualities

00:53:39.010 --> 00:53:42.170
if that makes any sense at all.

00:53:42.170 --> 00:53:54.200 position:56%
Okay, well I have just broken the
Internet and so any other questions?

00:53:54.200 --> 00:53:55.500
Okay.

00:53:55.500 --> 00:53:58.500
&gt;&gt; I think going back
to what you were talking

00:53:58.500 --> 00:54:02.700
about perceptual qualities,
I was thinking

00:54:02.700 --> 00:54:05.660
about all these [inaudible]
very useful especially

00:54:05.660 --> 00:54:06.960
when you're looking at online.

00:54:06.960 --> 00:54:08.260
&gt;&gt; Paul Messier: Yeah.

00:54:08.260 --> 00:54:09.560
Absolutely.

00:54:09.560 --> 00:54:13.180 position:56%
&gt;&gt; You can actually either see these
kinds of textural characteristics.

00:54:13.180 --> 00:54:14.480
&gt;&gt; Paul Messier: Absolutely.

00:54:14.480 --> 00:54:17.480
&gt;&gt; You know, now, [inaudible]
a lot of research that way

00:54:17.480 --> 00:54:20.350
but you can't immedoiately have
access to the original [inaudible].

00:54:20.350 --> 00:54:21.650
&gt;&gt; Paul Messier: Absolutely.

00:54:21.650 --> 00:54:22.950
&gt;&gt; It's extremely invaluable.

00:54:22.950 --> 00:54:24.730
&gt;&gt; Paul Messier: Yeah, I hope
Google is listening because yeah,

00:54:24.730 --> 00:54:31.650
I mean that's actually I mean so
the question the comment was how

00:54:31.650 --> 00:54:34.620
if you're doing online
access, online research,

00:54:34.620 --> 00:54:37.610
you're doing research online
you're presented with an image

00:54:37.610 --> 00:54:40.580
but you have almost no
information about the material

00:54:40.580 --> 00:54:43.450
and how these little
glyphs if it became kind

00:54:43.450 --> 00:54:48.200
of a convention would
really help tremendously

00:54:48.200 --> 00:54:53.760
and very simply communicate some
essential physical properties.

00:54:53.760 --> 00:54:58.970
Yeah, absolutely and that's a
big part of the agenda is to kind

00:54:58.970 --> 00:55:02.220
of get maybe try to, you know,

00:55:02.220 --> 00:55:05.730
develop this so it becomes
really conventional.

00:55:05.730 --> 00:55:08.370
And so when you're
cataloging a collection

00:55:08.370 --> 00:55:11.670
and by the way the other
part when it comes to like,

00:55:11.670 --> 00:55:13.180
are you doing the back,
are you doing the front,

00:55:13.180 --> 00:55:16.160
are you doing image, are
you doing all of that?

00:55:16.160 --> 00:55:20.490
Yes, and I understand in many
instances why that's valuable

00:55:20.490 --> 00:55:27.150
but to be honest really I'm all
about high levels of throughput.

00:55:27.150 --> 00:55:34.380
I want a lot of data; I
want a lot of photographs

00:55:34.380 --> 00:55:38.150
to be characterized at this level.

00:55:38.150 --> 00:55:42.700
So if before, you know, to
get that kind of buy-in,

00:55:42.700 --> 00:55:46.290
you can't say we'll do the
XRF of the highlights that,

00:55:46.290 --> 00:55:50.780
that's really important to
do on a case-by-case basis.

00:55:50.780 --> 00:55:53.980
But I think these statistical
modeling in these glyphs and all

00:55:53.980 --> 00:56:00.160
of that, what that can
do is help surface issues

00:56:00.160 --> 00:56:06.050
that may be do merit this really
tightly focused narrow throw the

00:56:06.050 --> 00:56:10.760
kitchen sink at it research agenda
like, wait, this is an anomaly.

00:56:10.760 --> 00:56:13.080
We need to figure out what's
going on here and so that's

00:56:13.080 --> 00:56:16.820
when you do the XRF in the
[inaudible] and the fiber analysis

00:56:16.820 --> 00:56:21.710
and all of that, or here's a big
band of things that are of the same

00:56:21.710 --> 00:56:23.010
and we know nothing about it.

00:56:23.010 --> 00:56:27.740
So let's take us a few samples
from within that band of sameness

00:56:27.740 --> 00:56:31.110
so we understand what's going
on, what's going on there.

00:56:31.110 --> 00:56:34.510
So it's a little bit of the kind
of this data-driven approach

00:56:34.510 --> 00:56:40.260
to understand where analysis
might be better focused.

00:56:40.260 --> 00:56:52.430
Sorry I was adrift a big drift from
your initial comment, sorry, Okay,

00:56:52.430 --> 00:56:56.140
I think I have officially used
up all the oxygen in the room

00:56:56.140 --> 00:56:59.250
and it's getting to
dangerous levels now.

00:56:59.250 --> 00:57:01.510
Again, thanks very, very much.
