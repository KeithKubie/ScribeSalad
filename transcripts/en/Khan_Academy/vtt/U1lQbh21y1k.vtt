00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:02.700
What is the average
rate of change

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.890
of y of x over the
interval negative 5

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:09.330
is less than x is
less than negative 2?

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.960
So this is x is
equal to negative 5.

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:16.750
When x is equal to negative
5, y of x is equal to 6.

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:23.180
And when x is equal to negative
2, y of x is equal to 0.

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:25.890
So to figure out the
average rate of change,

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:32.980
so the average rate
of change, of y

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:35.720
of x, with respect--
and we can assume it's

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:46.750
with respect to x-- let me
make that a little bit neater--

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:49.370
this is going to
be the change in y

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.480
of x over that interval over the
change of x of that interval.

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.810
And the shorthand for change
is this triangle symbol, delta.

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.110
Delta y-- I'll just write y.

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:01.470
I could write delta y of x.

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:02.310
It's delta y.

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:05.620
Change in y over
our change in x.

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:07.780
That's going to be our
average rate of change

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:09.070
over this interval.

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.200
So how much did y change
over this interval?

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.240
So y went from a 6 to a 0.

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.200
So let's say that we
can kind of view this

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.850
as our endpoint right over here.

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:20.370
So this is our end.

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:21.862
This is our start.

00:01:21.862 --> 00:01:23.820
And we could have done
it the other way around.

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.194
We would get a
consistent result.

00:01:25.194 --> 00:01:26.940
But since this is
higher up on the list,

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:28.190
let's call this the start.

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:29.527
And the x is a lower value.

00:01:29.527 --> 00:01:30.610
We'll call that our start.

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:31.900
This is our end.

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.570
So we start at 6.

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:34.920
We end at 0.

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.150
So our change in y is
going to be negative 6.

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.490
We went down by 6
in the y direction.

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:42.310
It's negative 6.

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.940
You could say that's 0 minus 6.

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.240
And our change in x, well,
we are at negative 5,

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.190
and we go up to negative 2.

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:51.270
We increased by 3.

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:59.710
So when we increased x by
3, we decreased y of x by 6.

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:01.820
Or if we want to simplify
this right over here,

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.220
negative 6 over 3 is the
same thing as negative 2.

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:06.920
So our average
rate of change of y

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.350
of x over the interval from
negative 5 to negative 2

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:12.430
is negative 2.

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.340
Every time, on
average, x increased 1,

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.570
y went down by negative 2.
