00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:11.130
The next question was what is the
mechanism of this T-cell exhaustion.

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.199
Why are these T-cells not able to kill the
target cells? Why are they not able to do

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.070
what the good memory cells do?
So the contrast here was with the highly

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.080
functional memory cells with the
dysfunctional cells under chronic infection.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:33.510
So what we then decided to do
was that we said, "Let us look at the gene

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.700
expression profiling of a highly
functional memory cell and compare it to

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:44.789
that of a highly dysfunctional cell." 
And the system that we used allowed us to

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:50.610
take T-cells of the same specificity -- 
and what I mean by that is it's a T-cell

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.530
which has a T-cell receptor that sees the
same peptide from the virus that we're

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.879
studying, but one was under the
conditions of an acute infection and the

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.690
cells are highly functional, another is
under conditions of the chronic

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.460
infection where the cells are
dysfunctional.

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.570
So we're not comparing apples and
oranges, we'd be comparing different

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:15.390
flavors of the same fruit. And so we
looked at the 20,000 plus genes which

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.670
are expressed by these cells, and we
found that there were some striking

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.960
differences in the gene expression
profiling of the exhausted cells

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.320
compared to the functional cells. 
There are many, many differences but what

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.689
we were struck with, and that was the
thing that really was the most

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:37.740
differentially expressed between these
two cells, was the expression of inhibitory receptors.

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:43.079
So there are inhibitory receptors 
that a cell can

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:48.030
express and these inhibitory receptors
actually inhibit T-cell receptor signaling.

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.890
A T-cell receptor is what
recognizes the tumor cell or the

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:58.140
infected cell and its signaling to the
T-cell receptor is needed for the cell to

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:05.219
then kill the target cell. So these are
inhibitory receptors that come up and are

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:11.370
regulating that T-cell receptor. 
And the most striking receptor that we

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:17.080
identified in terms of T-cell
exhaustion was a molecule called PD-1.

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:23.280
PD-1 stands for Programmed Cell Death 1.
This was a gene that was cloned by

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:30.370
Tasuku Hanjo in Japan in the early 1990s.
The gene had been around for a long time,

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:36.610
but its function in terms of chronic
infections, its function in terms of

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:42.520
T-cell exhaustion, was not known.
So our studies identified that this

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:48.280
molecule was expressed at very high
levels on these dysfunctional or

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:53.350
exhausted CD8 T-cells. But then what
really clinched the deal here was in a

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:58.870
collaborative study with Gordon Freeman,
who's a scientist at Dana-Farber Cancer

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:05.230
Institute at Harvard Medical School.
Gordon Freeman had antibodies that could

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:10.840
bind the inhibitory receptor. And the way
the inhibitory receptor works is that the

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.970
PD-1 will bind to a ligand that's
either on the tumor cell or on the

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:21.280
infected cell. This ligand is known as PD-L1,
L standing for ligand.

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:26.019
It's a molecule that will bind the
inhibitory receptor. So what Gordon had

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:31.360
made was antibodies that would either
bind the inhibitory receptor or the

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.530
ligand and prevent the block interaction
between these two. So if you prevent

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:39.850
interaction of the PD-1, which is on
the T-cell, the PD-L1 which is on your

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:44.049
target cell, if that interaction is
blocked, then the inhibition does not happen.

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:49.660
And the results we got were
really quite striking. We showed that if

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:55.329
you take a chronically infected mouse
and you infuse this mouse -- we inject into

00:03:55.329 --> 00:04:00.250
these mice antibodies either against the
inhibitory receptor or against the

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:05.230
ligand, disrupting that inhibitory
interaction -- suddenly now you restore

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:09.760
function back in the cells. The cells
begin to expand because they have the

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:14.049
TCR stimulation. They are able to kill
the virally infected cells, secrete

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:18.579
antiviral cytokines, and most importantly,
bring about a reduction of the viral load.

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:23.979
So this was the first demonstration
that this blockade of the PD-1 pathway in vivo

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:27.710
and the condition
of a chronic infection

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:32.780
would restore function back into the 
T-cells and result in the control

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:36.920
of the viral infection. So this finding
had a huge impact. This work was done

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:42.110
actually by a graduate student at Emory
University. Dan Barber was the first

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:47.030
author of this paper, and this paper
attracted a lot of attention. This was

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:54.500
published in 2006. Immediately there
was a flurry of papers that came,

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:58.280
and some of those we were involved in
collaborating with our friends,

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:05.510
showing that PD1 also is involved in
inhibiting HIV-specific T-cells.

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:10.610
This was a study we did with Bruce Walker at Harvard.
And then in studies that we did

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:15.050
at Emory with Arash Grakoui, who's a faculty
member at the Emory Vaccine Center,

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:19.910
Arash showed that the same thing happens in HCV-infected people.

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:24.020
People who are chronically infected with Hepatitis C
virus do have CD8 T-cells that recognize

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:26.870
HCV, but they have very 
high levels of PD-1

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:33.070
on their cell surface, and that
inhibits the function of those T-cells.

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:36.650
Others showed the same thing with
Hepatitis B and so on. So basically it

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:41.510
very quickly established that T-cell
exhaustion, as I told you, happens in many

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:45.680
chronic infections, but now it is also
shown that a major regulator of the

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:50.450
T-cell exhaustion is this inhibitory
receptor PD-1, and that blockade of this

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:54.470
interaction results in function in
those cells. So think of it as a brake

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:59.960
that's coming on the T-cells, so that the
T-cell receptor... you're pressing

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:03.590
the accelerator because
there's antigen stimulation, but the brake is on,

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:08.090
so basically nothing happens.
And releasing PD-1 is releasing

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:15.189
a brake on the T cells.
