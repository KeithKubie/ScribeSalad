Speaker 1:          00:00:00       So this is a new topic called the physics of dynamics of rigid bodies, so did did body is something that will not bend, will not change its shape when you apply forces to it, and one example could be a dime or coin or neither stick. Of course, nobody's absolutely rigid. You can always bend anything, but we'll take the approximation that we have in our hands, a completely rigid body. The technical definition of a rigid body is that if you pick a couple of points, the distance between them does not change during the motion of the body.

Speaker 1:          00:00:42       So the dynamics of rigid bodies in three dimensions is fairly complicated because what I want you to imagine now is not a point mass, but some object with some shape like this guy, take this and throw it up in the air. You can see it does something fairly complicated. In fact, we can characterize what it does using two expressions. I think you can guess what they are. One is if this had been a point mass than the point mass, we'll just go back and forth that up and down. It will do what's called translations. It will go from a place to another place, maybe on a straight line, maybe on a curve, but as it goes, the point masters, no further information. We got to tell me where it is and how fast it's moving. That's the whole story. But if you have a body like this, it's not enough to tell me where it is because if I throw this up in the air, you can imagine that asset travels along some parabolic path. One instant it is, it may look like this next instant it isn't may look like this. So we say that it is translating and rotating.

Speaker 1:          00:01:59       It's a non obvious theorem that anything the body does from one instance to the next instant can be achieved by first translating it than doing a slight, slight rotation to bring it to the configuration you want. In other words, you can go from here to here by a translation followed way rotation. Now translation is what we've been studying all the time because four point particles, there is no notion of retention. I take a point mass and rotated. You don't even know. It's rotating data's no internal variables. So that was the problem we've been focusing on, but not, we're going to enlarge over to study two objects which have a size and which have a shape. That's what we are to have an orientation. It's not enough to say the football is here, who ball could be here, but as long pointy and could be up to Donner site to site.

Speaker 1:          00:02:51       So what we want to do is to break the problem into two parts. We want to focus on a body which only rotating but not translating. Once we sharpened our skills, we will then put back the ability of the body to translate. So they're going to focus initially on a body that cannot translate. So what that means is you take the body and you grabbed one point in it, then you can ask what can it do? If I grabbed one point and well, any motion it does, we'd be set at that point is not moving. Now in three dimensions. If you take a football and at certain point is held fixed, it can generate in many ways. But at any instant you can show what it would be doing is to be doing a rotation out on an access passing through the point where you're grabbing it because the, if it rotates through an access points on the axis don't move and the point where to grabbing it better lie on that axis.

Speaker 1:          00:03:52       Now that's also pretty complicated. You can see why I gave you a little precautionary thing because it's hard to visualize these things. So again, I want to take the simplest possible problem, then make it more and more complex. Now you might say the simplest thing you've been doing all semester long is to take things in one dimension, but that turns out to be too low. If you've got any one dimension and you've got a rigid body by a bit, rigid body means not only extended but actually rigid. For example, if you take a cat or a snake, a snake, you can grab at one point or the snake is not simply doing rotations around the one point right? Trying to bite you, trying to move around because steak is not a rigid body. That's Nate could be rigid body living, snake, definitely not ready to buy it.

Speaker 1:          00:04:41       Now you got to remember that I've given you a break by studying rigid bodies, but real bodies, uh, can actually not only wobble and twist and turn, they can also vibrate and they can move their arms around. That's much more difficult. So we won't go there and we will try to take the simplest rigid body. But I said if I take a rigid body in one dimension, it cannot rotate at all because there's not room in one dimension to rotate. It can only go back and forth. So to show you that as some new possibility, I have to go at least two dimensions. Here's one example where one dimension is not enough. So I'm going to imagine rigid bodies which are living in the plane of the blackboard.

Speaker 1:          00:05:25       Now one way to do that is to take a piece of battle, just cut out a shape that's a rigid body. Now of course this has a slight thickness because anything you make of matter and has some thickness at please one atom thick. But imagine that thickness is negligible. So it's like a piece of metal piece of foil or something, but it's rigid and this is the rigid body. We are going to study. This rigid body can move in the plane of the blackboard and rotate, but we're going to grab it at one point. So let's pick some point here. If I grabbed it at that point and I asked you what can this fellow do you imagine skewer didn't get through the blackboard. You say, okay, do whatever you want. You realize that all it can do is to rotate around an axis penetrating that point.

Speaker 1:          00:06:17       So let's say a Tig weld the zero, the body look like this a little later, it's going to look rotated. I have to tell you what it is doing at a given instance. I have to tell you how each audience, so what we do for that is we draw through the point of rotation. Some line you can pick any line you like, pick a line like that and we'd say what angle that line makes with the standard Joyson direction. Usually the x axis fake give you a data. I think you have to think about it and you have to agree. I've told you where the bodies, you can reconstruct everything, right? Because that point is nailed. It cannot move. You take the body, you're trying to buy an angle data. In other words, here is a question. Suppose you're not in this room. You go to another room and I want to tell you what did they did body is doing?

Speaker 1:          00:07:13       What information do I have to communicate to you without seeing the picture I claim if I tell you how the line was drawn in the body, which is something you do once and for all ruled line, then I say the rural line makes an angle data with the exact axis. I believe you can imagine in another room what his body is doing and that's the meaning of saying I've given complete information. Of course, that's not a complete dynamical information because it also depends on how fast is rotating, but to simply say the analog of where the body is in one dimension is this angle data. So what we're going to set up, you will find is an analogy between one dimensional translation and two dimensional rotations. You'll find the analogy is very helpful. So I'm going to use the piece of the blackboard where I'll keep drawing that analogy.

Speaker 1:          00:08:06       I do this because the number of things you have to remember, it would be reduced if you map this problem mathematically to the problem with translation. One dimension, in other words, in one dimension, when a body is moving, x tells you where did this right? I give you a number three, a Pi or minus 14 you know where it is for this rigid body living in the plane of the blackboard is angled. Data tells you what the body's doing. So even though the body is in two dimensions, you need this one angle data to tell you what is orientations. You don't need two numbers. A single number tells you what the digit bodies doing, so a little later it could be rotated by an angle. Delta data.

Speaker 1:          00:08:51       That's the analog of seeing it move from x to x Plus Delta X. First thing you've got to do is how do you want to measure data for x? We know we have agreed we're going to measured in meters data. The standard preference for people at elementary stages system measured in degrees. You measured in degrees and when the body complete one full revolution, you like to say, let's turn by an angle of three 60 degrees. Now that is not the preferred way to measure angles. In more advanced dynamics, we're going to use something else. You can imagine what it is. You know what I'm driving at in nobody know where I'm going. Radium. So I'm going towards radiants and you can ask yourself, why would anybody think of a radiant? What's wrong with three 60 degrees? I mean all the textbooks, I mean all the novels say, you know, I was going down the wrong path than I did a one 80 right?

Speaker 1:          00:09:45       So everyone knows. Like I saw a book by a violinist who said I was going down all the wrong things. Then I did a three 60 so you realize that three 60 years, not really weird way to reform your life, but I'm on the physicist. It struck a chord in physics or three 60 is really not a trivial thing to do. It turns out the particles in the world that divided into Bose arms and fermions and half of the particles or bosons and roughly half affirming of electron is a fermion. The light quantum boys on and set for trial for all the guys who are photons are bosons. If you turn them by three 60 they come back to what they are doing. Electronic turns out when you turn it by three 60 all the numbers going into minus those numbers and only when you turned by seven 20 you come back to technically what you're doing.

Speaker 1:          00:10:41       So it's quite possible this person had in mind the behavior. Maybe she was from [inaudible] but that's what it said. I did a three 60 but I've got the three 60 many times. So if you use it you better back it up with the kind of information that gave. Otherwise you just off by a factor of two. Anyway, ThreeSixty is very nice. I think the Babylonians like three 60 for lot of reasons is divisible by a whole bunch of numbers that are easy to partition into smaller and smaller pieces. I believe in some engineering circles, a circle is 400 something else, some other engineering degrees. So you can decide what a circle is, but we like a radiant. So let's ask, why do we like it radio for that purpose. I want you to take a point here at a distance r from the center and let it move to a new location with an angle Delta Theta. You agree that if the rigid body is rotating, this guy will be traversing a circle of radius art because it's a rigid body. It cannot change the distance from this point. So we'll be going around in a circle and I'm asking you how big is that segment that are clanked delta that it has traveled when it was rotated? Ben Angle Delta data.

Speaker 1:          00:11:59       So one way to calculate that is to say, look, if I did a full circle, I would have done to pay our artists the distance of this point. In that I did body from the center [inaudible] listen to two Pi r but I've Gone Delta Theta. So the fraction of the circle I have covered you still today over three 60 if data is measured in degrees, so let me indicate that in this fashion so we can write this ass Pi over one 80 Delta Theta claims are if you measured data and degrees, this is what you have to do to convert an angular Trevor's to an actual distance along the kind into the circle, the linear distance you travel, it's connected with the angle by which you rotate by the distance r from the center. And this number here. So people say, look, why don't we make life easy by calling data at times, Pi would one 80 as a new angle. Let's call it Delta Theta fines are so Delta Theta without any little zero on top of it stands for radiants from no one and related to favor, he thought the deltas data itself is data in degrees times Pi over one 80

Speaker 1:          00:13:39       then the advantages, the distance you travel, linear distance, you travel better. Simple relations. The angle you travel by the arm length are from the center so you don't have to carry this one 80 and pie and everything. You can write the simple design but now when you do this, you are measuring it in radio. So you've got to have an idea. How big is it radio? Well a full circle. If you go full circle, the distance you travel should be to PR. So full circle we'll be Delta Theta equals two Pi. So your circle is worth two Pi Radians to pious like six so one radians roughly one six to three 60 which is 60 degrees. The real answer is close to 58 something degrees. It looks like an odd thing to pick. It's odd only if you start with three 60 degrees, but if you met people from an alien culture, he's just got to go to the supermarket around.

Speaker 1:          00:14:33       Did these people, those people may not be using three 60 at all. Three 60 is a human artifact. Nothing special about three 60 that's independent of our own cultural biases. Baby connected. How many fingers we have to maybe connect to how long a year is and so on. There's nothing natural about the number two 62 Pi. On the other hand, I believe would be discovered Baney advanced civilization. If you haven't figured out Pie, you're not advanced civilization. If you haven't figured out too, you're way behind them so you're not too and you know pie and that's what other cultures in other planets and galaxies would it be using. That's the unit we like to use. You'll find over and over people using units which are natural to us, but later on if you want to communicate with people in another planet, you will have to use different links.

Speaker 1:          00:15:22       For example, the height of a human are the length of Napoleon's army. They're not very good units. If you don't have an airport in, in your background, you don't know what you're talking about, but if you mentioned distances in how big it is in terms of an hydrogen atom, hydrogen atoms all over the universe, that's the natural length scale to use. This is a very popular issue. In the old days when they sent off a rocket or the buried something underground for aliens to find out, you want to show how tall we are. No use giving the answered in meters or feet or anything, but if we can somehow relate your size the size of a hydrogen atom, then that number will make sense to people in all civilizations because hydrogen atoms conveniently are manufactured and scattered all over the universe and they have the same size. Okay. Anyway, that's a long thing about ratings. That's why we like to use radios. You have to know a few popular angles and radiant measure because I'll be using only radiants most of the time you got to know a circle is two pi by user, half a circle and Pi over two is quarter circle, so when you turn by 90 degrees is Pi over two is that something you should know once you write it this way, let's get another result. That's very useful. Take the distance of travels along the tangents by the time over which it does that

Speaker 2:          00:16:44       this,

Speaker 1:          00:16:45       it's the actual pageant, some speed or the magnitude of the velocity in the tangential direction. I think you all agree with that. That's what you and I would mean by speed if other instant this piece of the sample just broke and flew off, it'll keep flying. Would that speed

Speaker 2:          00:17:04       this thing?

Speaker 1:          00:17:06       We have a symbol for it. Omega three and Omega is called the angular velocity.

Speaker 2:          00:17:12       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:17:12       and is measured in Radians per second

Speaker 1:          00:17:20       so you cannot, you can calculate and good velocity for various things. For example, what's the angular velocity of the moon as it goes around the earth? Well, angular velocity will be one revolution every 28 days, right? One Revolution is two Pi Radians at 28 days you do 28 times 24 times 3,600 if that many radians per second, oh that's a chain saw blade and the chain size spinning at some number of Rpm, maybe 3000 rpm. You can take revolutions per minute. Two revolutions per second. What you've got to remember, every revolution is two Pi Radians. So the angle of velocity off of blade, that spinning with frequency F is two Pi f. You understand that f is the number of complete revolutions? It does definitely pick a point on it. It does at travelers of 2.5 radians. So the dictionary has got a second member here, which is the velocity, which is DXDT. There's no the place, the angular velocity, which is de, De, de, De, de.

Speaker 1:          00:18:34       This is an analogy by the way, this is to help you say omega is like what velocity used to be in the old days when things are moving back and forth, but no, they're going round and round. But even here, there's the notion of velocity, what is not in meters per second as measured in Radians per second. Now here is something that you guys got to keep very clear in your head. I can only mention it to you but I cannot do it for you. This Omega is an analogous thing to ordinary velocity, but that is also an actual velocity here. The good old velocity, that's the tangential velocity of points with that part of a rotating the dead body. That is not part of my dictionary, but it's a very useful result to know. The tangential velocity is the angle of velocity times the distance of that point from the center of the rotation.

Speaker 1:          00:19:23       So the rigid body as a whole has a single, I ain't got a velocity. That's what it means to be redone. The whole thing is rotating. You cannot say the angle of velocity so and so here and so and so there. It's the property of the entire body for the linear velocity. It's not the same everywhere points and yet here in the same time go that far and points and yet he hadn't the same time go that far for the linear velocity increases from the center of the time. The angular velocity is constant and it's a rigid body cannot have to angular velocities. It's going to have only one angle over the last year.

Speaker 1:          00:19:57       Okay. Then what we do is we say, okay, let's take a problem with the angular velocity is itself changing. Fine. That's the analog of saying, let us have an agent of change of velocity and here we have a quantity called Alpha, which is the rate of change of I ain't going to velocity or the second rate of change of the angle, and that's been noted by Alpha. So if you took a team, if you took one of these rotating circular saws and it was spinning at a certain speed and due to friction, let us see the slowing down. I'd, when you turn on the motor speeding up, suppose he just turned on the saw motor and it's speeding up in the, in his rotation. You've got to be very clear that the acceleration of that of parts, this is the, this is the saw blade. Okay. This I'm trying to draw for you. One of these uh, saw blades and it's spinning. If you pick up points they on the circumference, you remember long back we learned even if it's going at a constant speed, constant angular speed, it has a tangential velocity which is Omega Times are and because of that it'll have an acceleration towards the center centripetal acceleration which is v squared over r and you can write it as Omega squared, r squared over r Omega squared off.

Speaker 1:          00:21:22       That's one acceleration. It has. Even if we're spinning at a steady rate, but I'm saying it can also have a tangential acceleration if on top of everything else the angular speed itself is changing. Let's take our time digesting that. This is not too hard, but I want you guys to understand if it's spinning at a steady omega, we have learned anything going in. A circle has an old fashioned linear acceleration toward the center, which is v squared over R, but we have realized V in the Tangential Directions Omega are so if you put that in, do you want, you can call it be tangential that gives me Omega squared r that just the v squared over r but if you put the brakes on this by speeding up or slowing down, it'll have an addition, an acceleration in this FedEx, so an acceleration of a point on the edge at anywhere else can have two components.

Speaker 1:          00:22:17       The tangent should want it to be that only if you speed up or slow down the rotating disk, but the radio one will always be there as long as it's rotating. Okay. Once you've got this dictionary new can have a whole bunch of analogous quantities. What example, if you focus on problems where the body is, has a constant angular acceleration alpha, what can you say where you can already say that data would be the theta? Not less initial angle of velocity plus one half hour 50 square. This is because data is behaving just like x. If x had a constant acceleration, a, we all knew x was equal to the starting x plus initial velocity times time plus one half 80 square. Similarly, the angle by which it rotates will be the initial angle, initial angle of velocity time plus something involving p square. This is only if alpha is a constant. This lake, I hope you guys know this is true. Only if ace account. All right, now I'm going to pursue the analogy and ask what is the kinetic energy offered? We did body winter's rotate. Yes.

Speaker 2:          00:23:45       Yeah. Acceleration with Alpha here. Um, right next to the salt lake. Oh, here. Uh Oh. Up this one. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:24:00       I'm saying if you have a rotating disk, take any point on rotating disk. Even if the disc is going at constant angular velocity, it has a tangential velocity and the direction of the velocity is constantly changing. This is the oldest thing we learned, so it has an acceleration towards the center that is not an angular acceleration. It's just a standard acceleration toward the center of anything going in a circle that's always going to be there, but on top of it, if you speed up or slow down the rotation rate of the disk, you'll also have a tangential acceleration, which is alpha times the

Speaker 2:          00:24:34       are not clear yet.

Speaker 1:          00:24:42       That's the acceleration lay people would know. If you're on a rotating platform and somebody sped up the rotation rate, you will notice you're going faster. That's the acceleration, the tangential direction, the acceleration towards the center is a more sophisticated one. We have learned and it's due to the fact that velocity is a vector and auto scaler, so the direction is changing. There's an acceleration. We associated with that and it as real as any other acceleration. It needs a force to make it happen. Maybe the better way to ask you is this. Suppose this little Spec here is you, okay, you happen to be stuck on a rotating chainsaw blade and you're clinging to it for dear life. What force do you have to apply to stay on for the rotating blade? This may not happen to you and me, but you know, fuel, organized crime.

Speaker 1:          00:25:33       This is not a very unusual situation. Uh, you can find yourself intermingled with all kinds of machinery and you want to know what do I do to stay on? Well, Newton tells you the answer. You wouldn't say this. If you want to be on this rotating chainsaw blade, your acceleration toward the center has to be paid for. And if the blade is speaking of speed, that's gotta be paid for two. That's the net acceleration. That time is your mass will be the force that has to be applied to you. So you will cling on to it with that force and that force will be applied in turn by the third law, by the disk on you.

Speaker 1:          00:26:10       For example. Suppose it's a top view of a rotating platform. You're just standing there and the platform is rotating. You can ask, what force does it, what frictional force does it need? Do I need to stay on the platform? Well, you need the force to provide you with a man. And I'm telling you, you're a has two parts. Even if the merry go down the spinning at a steady rate, you will need to have a friction force director towards the center to bend you into a circle and if on top of it the merry go round starts increasing its speed or decreasing its speed, you'll also needed tangential component of force. Probably the tangential acceleration.

Speaker 1:          00:26:47       Okay. Now this is kinematics off rotation at constant angular acceleration. It's identical to this one mathematically because mathematically if you know lead to data, d d squared is alpha. The answer is just like d two x over d squared equals ae. You changed the symbols. You get the same answer. You can imagine a variety of problems I don't feel like doing. I think you guys can easily do that. I'd rather focus on more difficult ones. But example, a chain saw blade spinning at 3,600 RPM is decelerated or some rate alpha. How long does it take to come to the rest? Well for that you will like the second formula or Megan, he comes Omega Zero Plus Alpha t. That's the analog of v Equals v zero plus 80 and you start with some Omega, not you put on the brakes. Alpha will be some negative number. You see at what time does Omega goes to zero. That's when it'll stop. Now that result, which I will use today, in fact it's the following or mega square is Omegas zero square plus two alpha it a minus state or not. That's the analog of B squared Equals v Zero Square. Let's do a x minus x. Now this is if the body has an acceleration alpha, then it's going to speak up speed. Of course in the final speed square is related initial angle of velocity squared plus two times the acceleration times the angle rotated.

Speaker 1:          00:28:21       So this is the analogy, so we don't have to reinvent all of these things. They just come from the fact that things which are mathematically the same have the same mathematical results will be the same equation. They were the same results. All right, now let's find the Kennedy Energy author. Rigid body, it's, it's got mass and if we're spinning all the little atoms making up the body are moving. They got their own one half MV squared and we wanted to ask what does the total one, half MV squared, some Dover, all the particles for that purpose. It's convenient to take the following simple. A rigid body were taken into the body by taking [inaudible] and one at that. This is auto one connected to some central hub with the massless rod and you take another mass and you'd take a third mass. This is m two senators, an art to this AME three at a distance, r three and so on. You can make a rigid body by modeling it in a simple fashion. If you are a little more abstract, you can take a continuous rigid body and do the same thing, but let's start with the simple thing. Here's the rigid body, three rigid rods with mass as m one m two and three and it's nailed here and that is a skewer going through the board and things can only rotate around that.

Speaker 1:          00:29:45       By the way, I should tell you the convention for Omega in one dimensional motion velocity is positive. You're moving to the right and negative here and moving to the left with angular velocity, we got to have a convention on what's positive and what's negative. This thing with the spinning can only spend clockwise or counterclockwise. It turns out to be that Omega is positive for counterclockwise. That just happens to be the kind of mentioned people use. In fact, you notice the way I drew the rigid body when I did Delta Theta had rotating counterclockwise. That's the preferred direction for measuring the angle theta from the x axis. Okay? Now let's take this rigid body. It is rotating with a common angular velocity. I hope you all understand that the meaning of being graded, everybody's got the same angle of Velocity Omega, so what's the kinetic energy of this object is the kinetic energy of each mass summed over all the masses. I M I v I square.

Speaker 1:          00:30:54       Now, what's the velocity of each object? If you dig this body and one it's the last day is necessarily perpendicular to the line. Joining it to the point of rotation. This one is moving this way. It cannot move in the line joining it because if it is, it's not a rigid body, rigid body. All distances are maintained so you don't come near the center, you don't go far from the center, so all you can do is rotate around the center. So the velocity of this Guy v one is equal to Omega Times are one the last year. This Guy v two it's the same Omega Times are too so on. So you can then add it all up and what do you get? You get one half some overt I m I r I square omega squared and you have to do the summation over all the bodies. In my example, summation goes from one to three. You may have one to infinity. I want a million. It doesn't matter. That's the kinetic energy.

Speaker 1:          00:31:57       You guys follow this. This is not a new candidate energy. This is what we know to be kinetic energy. Just one half MV where for every piece that makes up the rigid body for convenience, I've taken that he did body to be made up of a discrete set of masses, but Navea notice as you go from one to three m one and m two and m three at three different numbers. We don't know what the masses are are when an art to an r three or three different numbers. We don't know how each one could be at a different business from the origin, but the Omega doesn't have a subscript I that nothing called Omega for this one and we'll make up for that one. There's only one Omega for everything so you can pull it out of the sun and write it this way.

Speaker 2:          00:32:39       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:32:39       Then the answer we write as identical to one half, I let me a square and be given this ina I is called the moment of an issue.

Speaker 2:          00:32:56       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:33:01       so continuing with the analogy, this board is going to be as fun analogy. We used to have k equal to one half MV squared, yet we are going to have k equal to one half I omega squared

Speaker 1:          00:33:20       and I is called the moment of an issue. So the moment of inertia is determined not only by the masses that make up the body, but how far they are from the center. If all the massive just fell on top of the center of the body would have no moment of inertia, it'll weigh the same moment of inertia would vanish. Likewise, if the massive spread out [inaudible] she is more. For example, if I'm standing around here and you come along and decide to spin me, I'm standing like this, we try to spin me for sticking my hand sewed. My moment of inertia has changed because some of my mass now is further away from the axis of rotation. So one metal finish year depends on the arrangement of the masses. We're taking a rigid body, not like ice dancers who do this with talking about a rigid body. Therefore, men of inertia is constant.

Speaker 2:          00:34:13       Okay?

Speaker 1:          00:34:15       But it requires a calculation to find the moment of inertia. And here's another important thing. If I decide to rotate the body about a new location, say around this point, want me to finish, it will change because all the distances are really changed. The moment of finesse. Yet if someone says, here are the masses, here's where they are, please find me. The moment I finish it, you will say, I cannot do it. You want to say I cannot do it till you tell me the point. Our own which you plan to rotate the body. Unless that is given. I cannot tell you what the moment of inertia is. That for the moment of Venetia is with respect to

Speaker 2:          00:34:55       a point.

Speaker 1:          00:34:58       There's nothing called the mass with respect to the point, the massive just the mass Mormon definition. It depends on the point. I don't know which your computing, the moment of a nation, it's a video is also worth knowing that if the body is being rotated about mass m three than empty doesn't contribute to momentum. Financial aid's out anything sitting on the axis doesn't contribute things for the further away, contribute more in proportion to their mass and proportion. The square of the distance from the axis. So this is my dictionary here. So who is playing the role of mass? Mass is played very moment of inertia. It's got units of kilogram meters square and no one has given a name for that. What example? Newton Times meter is called a Jew. You can ask. No, this is kilograms times, meters square. Maybe it's named after somebody. So far it's not be named after anybody or did they just call Newton meters square? So this is going to be the analog off mass, you know world of rotations. You remember in the world of rotation we defined something called momentum is mass times velocity. Here they're going to set up a call, something called angular. Momentum is going to be I times omega. This I is called the angular momentum.

Speaker 1:          00:36:29       One extremely important point that you guys should notice is that all the concepts I'm using like mass and energy, they are the same old concepts that we learned earlier on. The fact that it's rotating body doesn't change anything. Okay? Kennedy again are they still means the same. This k though it looks so different is in fact the one happened B squared of every part of the body. Some dough with the bodies. All right, so this l is called angular. Momentum will take a while to get used to this, but right now it's the product of the moment of inertia. Angular velocity, so now we are looking for the most important equation in mechanics, which is f equals m a

Speaker 1:          00:37:14       that's going to be equal to some mystery object. Now you should be able to guess what goes on the right hand side. Okay? You should know by now by analogy. It can be written as d l d t v like rate of change of momentum or it can be written as i-times alpha. It doesn't matter. I hope you understand that if a take rate of change, the momentum you want to get mad because when you take the bit of it to Amazon are changing. Likewise here, if you take the l d t I is not changing Omegas changing to give you what do you make a DDS? Alf, I is not changing because as the body rotates of coarse particles in the body and moving around, but that at a distance from the point of rotation is not changing. Even though the bodies and moving to new locations, the odd squared is the same because they're just rotating. That's why the in the time that it would do, you don't have to take the time that it would do at the moment of inertia, but we don't know who's going to play the role on the left hand side. Okay, so we had to go to find that are going to find out the analog of that.

Speaker 1:          00:38:20       So I'm going to tell you there are many ways to find this out. It's a lot more subtle than generally appreciate it on what the correct lies. You can hit the last stated quite often, but some of the reasonings behind it are. So let me tell you one way to get to the law. I hope you know what I'm looking at. I'm trying to find out what is the entity that is responsible for the rate of change of angular momentum or what's the analog of the lefthand side for m a, I know the right hand side is I am for by analogy who is on the left hand side. First of all, it's pretty clear that if you want the angular momentum of the body to change, Omega has to change. You can see if something is spinning around at some fixed Omega, you want to change it, you've got to push up Buhler, do something. So obviously going to play a force, but the thing that comes to the left hand side is not simply the force but something else and we'll find out what the something is and that's done by the following device. I'm going to use the good old work energy theorem that says when force acts on the body, the work that it does,

Speaker 2:          00:39:29       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:39:30       which is the force times the distance it travels is equal to the change in the kinetic energy.

Speaker 1:          00:39:43       That is the standard work in a DTM that we establish. So if you took a rigid body like this and let's apply it to the rigid body, I'm just going to take a simple case of rigid body with this two masses, m two and m one it doesn't matter. I apply a force now f perpendicular to the body at the distance r from the point of rotation and let it turn the body during that time. Uh, let's say the body moves when I'm on Delta data, maybe I should draw you a better picture for this because this is very, very important. So he had us the body, I just took a simplest one with two masses and one and two. I'm just going to push it here and I decided to push it in this direction and it's half the distance r from the point of rotation and let it turn by a small angle and come to this position. This angle is delta data. What does the work done by this force?

Speaker 2:          00:41:03       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:41:06       I am going to write it down, but I want you to think about it work that way. The force is the force multiplier for the distance over which it has moved. And basically I'm asking you what does that distance it has moved and if you remember anything at all from what I did earlier, it's approximately this arc length, which we have seen is our times delta theta.

Speaker 2:          00:41:33       In

Speaker 1:          00:41:34       other words, if you applied for SAF and you rotate the body bay data, the distance you actually move is our Delta Theta. So this is force times distance. No, that's got to be equal. The change in Kennedy Energy, it's gotta be equal attendant. Kinetic energy, kinetic energy. I remind you is one half I will make a square that for the change in Kennedy Energy is going to be one half I femmes Omega squared minus the initial Omega Square. By the way, these are two very enabling instance in time. If the neighboring instance in time, during that brief period, we may take the body to have a constant acceleration that for Alpha is constant. So this are this formula. You can also calculate when alphas constant period in a real body, when there's rotating alphanine not be constant, but for the small enough interval, as small as you wish, we may have played the formula that works when Alpha is a constant.

Speaker 1:          00:42:39       In that case, you would write it as one half times to Alpha Times rotation angles, right? Look at this formula here. I'm referring to this rezone. We'll make a final square minus Omega initiative squared is two times Alpha Times the change in angle. So I want you to then equate this work done, this change in Kennedy Energy. I want you to equate this guy, this guy, and we get our great results that f times R is equal to I find Alpha I alpha is m a that's what I'm looking for. So this Fella here, Fr is the analog of force and it's called the torque.

Speaker 1:          00:43:35       It's very important to notice that the torque due to this force is the value of the force times the distance from the point of rotation and it's only the external force that I'm talking about. They're also internal forces in Iraq. Every part of the art is being dragged along the way. Another part of the Rod. But uh, that analysis in terms of forces can be done, but it's very tricky and complicated. It's much easier to look at the energy where the energy changes only due to external forces. If you only look at forces, you've got to be careful. This pivot point is also playing a force on the right, but it's not moving and not doing any work. So the only external force is the one I'm applying and Andrew's responsible for the change of the Kennedy energy that our other forces inside the rock. In other words, this mass is going to pick up speed. Not because I'm directly pushing it. I'm probably pushing this part of the rod and that's putting the part next to it and the propagates and the finally pushes this one. So I'm not directly applying the force lot of this mass. I'm saying whatever has happening internally, I don't care. The external force times distance is a chain of the kinetic energy of an object. Yes.

Speaker 2:          00:44:47       Good.

Speaker 1:          00:44:55       No, I said this quantity, the chains and Kennedy. Kennedy is the final candidate going to do one half Iomega square minus the initial candidate energy with final initial refer to when the rod was there and the and the Rod. I rotated by a small amount.

Speaker 2:          00:45:12       Right? Okay. All right. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:45:22       here. No, I use this equation, the chain, the Omega squared at the end minus the Omega squared at the beginning is two times the acceleration in angular acceleration times data, minor state or not is the change in data over that time. Right? In other words, that formula can be used for even finite PDFs of time provided Alpha is constant. We're applying it for a tiny period of time, small enough for us to believe that the acceleration during that tiny period is some number alpha. So this Omega squared men who make an r squared, is it really? If you want a change in Omega squared and that's proportional to Alpha Times of change in angle. So Alpha is not a constant ow fucking Vaidy from incident to incident. But at that one instance, depending on the forces, that will be some Alpha and this thing called park. Is it times alpha? Now, I think it's very clear that if I had several forces acting on the body than the torque will be. F I R I and that's just one final caveat to this thing. One final qualification, which is that in practice, the forces that I used to rotate the body may not always be perpendicular.

Speaker 1:          00:46:40       You can apply a force in some other directions like that.

Speaker 1:          00:46:48       Now you got to realize that park is the ability to change the rotation state of a body and what video is realizing is that it depends on the force you apply and depends on how far away the forces from the point of rotation. So if you have a door, you're trying to open a door, here's the door, you enter the hinges and you want to open this door by applying a force. The question is where do you put the door? Not Okay. You suddenly invented the door, you thought about hinges, but you haven't quite figured out where to put the door, not you got to ask yourself, well, I have complete freedom. It'll look nice, but put it there right next to the hinges. Then you realize that there are parts of the universe like more on land where if you go all the hinges, all the door knobs that here and they're saying, you know we are applying a lot of force, we're not getting anywhere.

Speaker 1:          00:47:44       What's wrong? Well, what we are realizing is that various forces, everything in linear motion forced to not everything in rotational motion. You want to get your money's worth. You got to take the door knob as far as you can and put it near the end. Okay. Then you figured that out. Then you come along and you say, okay, I put the door knobs at the right place to open the door. Then you are playing enormous force this way and again frustrated again, you're getting no results. He said, I'm going as far as they can from the hinge and and it dawns on you that if you really want to get something going, you should really take the line of separation between where it's rotating and where you're applying the force and a force perpendicular to any part parallel to it. It's not doing anything unless you try to rip it off.

Speaker 1:          00:48:32       The hinges, you don't want to do that. So here, this force has got a useless part and the guard or useful part and the useful part, they useless part, which is trying to pull the rod off the hinges is going to be balanced by a force from the hinges because they're artists that really draw is not going to move, but the one perpendicular to the rod can in fact turn the rod without affecting the rigidity. So we need an extra factor here, which is sine theta I but Taita is defined as the follows. If you are at a point our eye and you are play force F that way, Theta is the angle between the line joining the point of application of the force and the direction of the force. You are here and you're separated by this vector and there's the angle between the separation vector and the force that angle theta can vary from force to force.

Speaker 1:          00:49:25       For this force F I angle could be data I, that's the final formula for the torque. Okay, so we have built up all the pieces and this is the final answer. This is the definition of Torque and with this torque we can now complete the dictionary and say what we want in the left hand side is the torque with metronic is defined as f. I. R. I signed data I f signed data. It's just a component of the force perpendicular to the separation are. That's what Fci data does. I hope you can see that you've got a force acting this way, f course sine theta as this part, which is no good and that scientists that part, which is good photo rotations.

Speaker 1:          00:50:12       Also if you want in terms of work done, you want the force times the distance traveled. Distance traveled is only in this direction. There is no distance traveled in this direction, so the distance traveled, yes, f. Dot. Product with the bad action in which you move and that applies only to the force pat perpendicular to the separation knocked to the part that is parallel. Anyway, I hope you understand intuitively why this is the guy that's responsible for rotating objects. Do you want to rotate something? I don't. Some axes. You've got a certain amount of force. You're best off applying the force as far as you can from the point of rotation. In other words, suppose we want to rearrange the stable here, keeping this and fixed but want to turn it so it's this way. Then I'm saying I think we all know we want to start pushing here also.

Speaker 1:          00:51:06       We don't want that play force this way or that way. We want to play force perpendicular. If for some reason we get tied to a rope and can only pull in that direction, then the component of the force, this ways to be discounted, no use. This is the part that does the training and that's why that's the part that also does the work. Any forest perpendicular, the motion is not going to do any work is the fourth protection. Any force [inaudible] nickel, that displacement is not going to do any work. This rigid body can only be later in that position. So that displacement is in a tangential direction and only the force in a tangential direction contributes to the work. And in my work energy argument, that's what comes in. This is the reason why you come up with this definition of torque. Okay, so we've got, uh, most of the pieces for this, I will write one more thing by analogy. The work done by a force that displaces a body for animal dx is this, the work done by a torque will be towel times. I think you can guess what I want to put there by Ams d theta or Delta data. When a torque rotates a body, but angle Delta Theta, then the work done is tout times delta data. You can see that even here

Speaker 1:          00:52:29       you can write the word down as F Times r team, Delta Theta. But that is the torque. That's the Delta t. So it's very useful to know. So if you guys are going to reason by analogy, I would ask you to know the counterparts only then you can do the problems. So let's take a, let's get used to this formula here. Delta W, Star, Delta Theta show you one example. Suppose I have a rod hanging from the ceiling. Well, let's saves massless and there is a mass Emma at the bottom and it's got some length l. It's a pendulum. I'm going to take this pendulum and I'm going to bring it to this position by an angle data, not just the unfortunately paid or not here at Stanford. The final angle, I want to know how much work I do. That's what we're going to calculate, so be it takes that intermediate position. When we add here, what does the force acting on this guy? This rod is massless the forest on this. This AMG.

Speaker 2:          00:53:42       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:53:43       If that angle is data, you can see that bangle is the same paper, empty core sine theta acts this way and MD signed data acts that way.

Speaker 1:          00:53:58       The whole the pendulum from falling when the angel is data, I have to apply a tangential force in this direction of size Mt. St Theater. I hope you guys can see that the empty coal sine data is going to be provided by the Rod because rod is a rigid body. It won't let the mass move in this direction. It'll provide water, would force it takes to keep the mass moving radially in the tangential direction to keep it from sliding back to where it began. I have to apply force mg sine data, so the torque that apply is mg sine theta times l, so I did all that by taking the force, finding the component of the forest perpendicular to the thing and balancing it with the countervailing force. You can equally say the park that I have to apply, it's really mg, which is the force odd, which happens to be l here and sine of the angle between them.

Speaker 1:          00:54:57       No matter how you write it, that's the torque. Let's find the work done by that torque. When I rotated from the starting angle to some final angle, that'll be m g l signed data, deep data from zero to some final angle data, not, I'm just saying the word done stout dealt at data summed over all the angles that means integrate. So you've got to go back to your calculus thing and you got to remember that the integral of scientists minus goes signed data and you want to start from theta equals zero that they take to some final angle to it or not. And if you crank it out you will find there's AMG l times one minus go sign in theater. So that's the work done to take a pendulum which is horizontal, which is vertical and turn it into an angle. Taylor. Now

Speaker 1:          00:55:55       I'm going to do a cross check on this to tell you that it works out from another point of view. This mass was down here. No, it's claimed that there. So you can ask what happened to the work I did. Going back to work entity Theorem, let's take this mass here. Forces are acting on it. One was the rod, but the force of the artist always perpendicular to the motion of this Bob here. So it couldn't do any work. They only work was done by me. What happened to the work did work I did has to be changing the total energy of the body, but the Bob was not moving before and it's not moving after because I give just the right force to cancel gravity. I didn't give it any speed. So it must be that the potential energy of this Bob and his here should explain the work I did. That's exactly what it is because let me rewrite. This is AMG minus MGL. Let me see a plus MTL co signed data.

Speaker 2:          00:57:02       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:57:02       well maybe we can see that. Uh, it is mg, sorry plus MGL this one. Well I think it's best to write it as l minus Elko scientist and you guys can see what's going on Ellis. This distance here. Elko, sine theta is that distance in l minus Elko send data is the increase in the height of this Bob. This height here is in fact l minus Elko scientists because of that is l that is data. This is Elko signed data to that point. So this is just mg times the height and that's where your work went.

Speaker 1:          00:57:47       So what's the point of this exercise? This exercise is to get you used to the notion of calculating work done, not as forced time distance, but a star times angle. And here's the problem where the torque itself is changing with the angle. The torque is of cell function of data. So you have to do an integral and that's how you get work. Okay, so now we've got all the machinery we need, got all the machinery we need to do kinematics and dynamics of rigid bodies in this analogy. So let me summarize what it is. Got a rigid body. He's got a moment of inertia. It's got an angular velocity. The product of the two is called the angular momentum l. And to change it, you gotta play a Torque. The find the Torque Pine, all the external forces acting on the body multiplay each force by the distance from the point of rotation or the component of each force perpendicular to the line of separation times that distance and separation.

Speaker 1:          00:58:54       That's the Fr scientists ETA and added up. Again, when you do the torques you've got to give it a sign. If at tar trends to rotate a body counterclockwise, we will take it as positive and if the tart tends rotator body clockwise we'll take it as negative. So it's possible that in a given body that could be torques trying to move it in different directions. So for example in the simplest rigid body made up say two masses, you could be pushing this way and I could be pushing that way. You're all trying to rotate them in opposite directions. The park you apply, it would be your fourth time. That distance, this is called positive because you're going counterclockwise torque that I'm applying will be my fourth time to smaller distance and there'll be considered negative because it's clockwise and you will add them up. You'll get a net torque.

Speaker 1:          00:59:46       That net torque will cause an acceleration of this dumbbell like object. What acceleration will it cause? It'll be my force times, my distance scientist. I have habits we want minus your force times the distance over which you're doing it times a moment to finish up the moment of furniture for the simple problem is m one or one square plus m two r two squared. If this is m one and this is our one and this is m two and that distance is art too. So this is the simplest problem you could do in rigid body dynamics. Take a couple of forces, workout the torques divided by a moment of inertia and get the angular acceleration. If the Torque is a constant, it's hard to maintain that. What do I have to do to keep the torque constant? I got to start running around with this acid rotates and you could imagine doing that. Then the target will be constantly, Alpha will be constant alpha constantly. It's like a constant and you can do the whole bunch of problems you guys did before.

Speaker 1:          01:00:55       Okay? Now that is one technical obstacle you've got overcome if you want to do rigid body dynamics. And that is to know how to compute the moment of inertia for all kinds of objects. If I give you 37 masses, eat with the distance r from the point of rotation, it's a trivial thing to Mr squared for each one and add it. But here's the kind of objects you may be given. Not a discreet set of masters but a continuous blood. Just like in the case of center of mass, when he had a bunch of masters, you took em one x one plus m two x two plus m three x three and so on. But if you had a rod, which is continuous, you have to do an integral. So you will have to do an integral here. All right, so let's take certain rigid bodies and tried to find that moment of inertia, which are rigid bodies which are continuous. So here is a ring of radius r and mass amp. It's not a disc in spite of what it looks like, it is a ring and I want to find her. It's moment of inertia.

Speaker 1:          01:01:58       You have to think about what you will do. So you think for a second and I'll tell you the way I will do that is to partition it into tiny pieces into which is small enough for me to consider a point. This tiny piece has a Mass Delta am I and I goes from one, two, three, four to whatever 10 million they go around the circle. Want me to finish? Yeah. Would be, I use Delta Mia to tell you it's a tiny mass for this section, but what is the r square? If I plan it to rotate it around that point plan to rotate around that point, it is the same artist squared for everybody so you can pull it out of the summation and he'd just get Mr Square.

Speaker 1:          01:02:46       So this is a bit easy problem. This as easy as this problem. Then you clearly had only one mass and all of it was that distance r from the point of rotation is Mr squared here you got the mass spread out. Luckily spit it out, spit it out in such a way that every part of it is the same distance out from the center. So it's very easy to do the summation, pull out the arch where do the sum over mass and get the total Max. Then we are going to do any question about this. Everything's going to be built on understanding this. So for the ring, this is the moment of inertia with just Mr Square, but now I want to do the following. I want to take a disc now.

Speaker 2:          01:03:27       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:03:28       of radius R I got her to the summer but Mr squares for every mass in the problem. So he here's where do you have to organize your thinking? I'm plan to do the moment of furniture through the center. First of all, if he didn't tell you all my to finish it through where you cannot even start, I tell you I want it through the center that wanted through the center. We have the ability then to think of this as made up of a whole bunch of concentric rings, each one at radius r and a thickness. Dr

Speaker 1:          01:04:06       If it can find the moment of an issue of this tiny shaded region. I some over all this certain, all the little washers that annual assist and you like that. I have to fill up the whole disk. What's the moment of inertia of this Angeles? Well, I already told you if the analyst has a mass m Mr squared is the moment of Finnish. Yeah. Of the analysts, but so the question is what does the mass of the shaded region, clearly the r squared to use is the audit which it is sitting, but what's the mass I should use for the mass I should use? I argue that if the total mass is that that time is Pi r square is the mass per unit area than I need the area of this shaded region. That's the tricky part. If you've got that. Yes. Right. So let's ask why it's two Pi r d. R. If you take this analyst and you take a pair of scissors and you cut it out and you open it out, he's going to look like a long rectangle. It's thickness will be the R is length will be to PR.

Speaker 1:          01:05:24       So two Pi r d r is the,

Speaker 2:          01:05:26       yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:05:30       that's as contribution. Here's the Dr and have you got to add it up over everything? Adding it up is what we do by doing the integral. I don't want to do this integral, you guys can. We can at least guess what's going to happen. There's going to be no pie in the answer. Why is gone. We've got our r squared is r cubed r to the fourth of our four and that will, if you combine it with that you get this Mr squared over two. So more matter of finesse you often discuss Mr squared over two.

Speaker 1:          01:06:04       That's because if I came and told you woman definitely supports, they made a calculation mistake somewhere and I said is Mr Square? We'll you know I'm wrong and why would he argue that cannot be the right answer. Yes. Well it's like the brain but the radius. Smaller group, right? In other words, this answers correct answer is if it does Mr Square, it means the entire mass is that the designs are square, but we know some of the masters a lot closer to the center. In fact, some of fitness right at the center, so you cannot get the same capital r squared as a contribution from all the pieces. Some will be at zero distance. I will be at the full distance. So whenever at the moment of inertia for disk, it's gotta look like Mr Squared Times a number, which is definitely less than one. Turns out to be half. If you've got a third or a fourth, you will know it's obviously wrong. But if I got one in front or where civic art two times Mr Square, then you know I made a mistake. Okay. Now the last of the objects I want to look at today is a rod. I want to take

Speaker 1:          01:07:23       this actually the example that's done quite often, but that's the first example. But I will do it now. So here, this eight Rod. Okay, that's length l mass m and I say, what's the moment of inertia? You know what you could do? What's the first question you will ask? When I say, what's the moment of an issue? I don't work point right till I tell you that you cannot begin. So I will say, let's find a moment of inertia. I the sense of what you should imagine in that case, you stick a nail through here and the guy who rotates like that on a big circle with that as the center, if you start the nail through the mid point, it's a different story. The answer's different. So here what I do is I take a distance ex, I take a sliver of thickness dx. That's sliver the small enough for me to consider it as a point mass. Therefore, the moment of an issue of that tiny portion will look like the square of the distance times the mass of the tiny portion mass. The tiny portion, it looks like this. Let me see. Ah, that's the mass. But unit length, that's the length. That's the mass of the object. Then I have to do the integral from zero to l.

Speaker 1:          01:09:05       Well x squared will give me x cubed over three that'll give me an l square over three. That's the moment to finish you off the ride. Again, it looks like ml square. It's got to have a number in front of it. That's less than one because if you're mentioning from here, the furthest you can be is l a lot of the guys had a lot closer, so the weighted average of the square of the distance cannot be all in squared. It's gotta be something less than elsewhere. The fact that it's one third is of course what you do all the work for.

Speaker 2:          01:09:40       Pardon me?

Speaker 1:          01:09:44       You forgot the l here. Also, the dimension for moment of inertia should be in the end mass times length square. You're not happy with that. You agree? Okay, look, sometimes I do get these things wrong, so you should always try to keep an eye on this. The last thing I want to do is to find the,

Speaker 2:          01:10:11       okay,

Speaker 1:          01:10:14       but when I say last thing I want to do, I don't mean I'm reluctant to do it. I'm just saying I'm near the end of the day. The final thing that I will now calculate is the moment of inertia around the center. Let's see what's going to happen. It's the same integral x where the x over l m over l, but the range of integration for x will love go from minus l over to the plus l or two.

Speaker 1:          01:10:51       Then I simplify my life by writing it as two m over l times x squared DX from zero to l over to, this is something I encourage you to do all the time. If an integral isn't even function at Beck's, namely negative x contributes as much as positive x, then you can take half the reason of integration and double the answer. You can do it only if it's an even function. So excellent. Yes. Oh, I'm sorry. You're absolutely right. The way to do that would be here. So you keep trying. You will catch me. That's right. That's correct. Okay, so let's do this now to m over l. Okay. Uh, now I'm really anxious because this l l cube, it's the x cubed over three. But the thing that's been cubed as l over too and that's giving me ml square over 12

Speaker 1:          01:11:57       so the moment of inertia is not a fixed number. It got a lot smaller. When I took it around the center of mass, when I took it around the left edge, I got ml squared over three I went to the midpoint, I got ml square or well I think it's pretty clear that in going from here I reduced the answer. You might say, why not keep going? Maybe we'll get even smaller. That's where your common sense should tell you that if you got some answer from there, you're going to get the same answers from here and you hit the best possible moment of inertia. You can. You should be able to do argue intuitively and if you do the calculation, it will come out to be the same. Now the thing to check, if you do this, the moment of financial are on one end is the moment of inertia around the center, less the mass times l over to square.

Speaker 1:          01:12:44       This is something you can actually verify. Just take the numbers I gave you and you will find that this answer plus m times l over to square will be equal to that answer and this happens to be very general theater and I'll talk about next time if you know the moment I finish here through the center of mass, you're done. Because if I want the moment of inertia through any other point, I take the moment of inertia through the center of mass and add to it the total mass of the object and the square of the distance by which you made me move my access, which here happens to be l over too. I haven't of course proved this. I don't want to give you anything without proof. We can actually in our class actually satisfy ourself to this is true. Not only is it true for a rod, it's even true for a disc. It's true for any object in two dimensions that if you've got the moment of inertia of this creature through the center of mass and you wanted through that point, just take the answer to center of mass and add to it AMD square. Where is that? This that'll be proven next time.
