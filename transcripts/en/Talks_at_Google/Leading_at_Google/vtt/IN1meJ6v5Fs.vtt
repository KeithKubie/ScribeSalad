&gt;&gt;Cliff: Hello, everyone and welcome to another
outstanding Authors at Google Talk. It is

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.830
with extreme personal pride and pleasure that
I introduce Dr. Bob Sutton to speak with us

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:14.299
today. Now, together with Jeff Pfeffer at
the Stanford Graduate School of Business,

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:19.620
Dr. Sutton has revolutionized business thought
in a world that's oversaturated with buzz

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:25.160
words, with half-truths and dangerous bits
of misinformation. Dr. Sutton provides us

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:30.180
with to cross the knowing-doing gap. He warns
us against these dangerous half-truths and

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.160
he speaks out against assholes in the workplace.

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.160
[laughter]

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:38.280
So, he's done a big, outstanding contribution
to corporate America. Now, Dr. Sutton is,

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.719
as you may know, is a Harvard Business School
trained Professor. He's currently a professor

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.390
of organizational behavior in the Department
of Management, Science and Engineering at

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:53.269
the Stanford University. So, he's an engineer
at heart and his MS&amp;E 280 class is one that

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:57.409
I took and that many other people took in
the audience and it was really one of the

00:00:57.409 --> 00:01:03.819
monumental, life-changing classes and inspirational
classes while at the Stanford MS&amp;E school.

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:08.770
And he's also the source of my favorite quote
from the entirety of grad school that's especially

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:13.980
important if you're trying to decide whether
to go to the PhD or do research or actually

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:19.390
work. Dr. Sutton says at the end of his final
class, "Work is overrated," so you gotta keep

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:21.290
that in mind throughout your working life.

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:22.290
[laughter]

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.450
Now, Dr. Sutton was gonna talk to us today
about his latest book, which is entitled "Good

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:32.470
Boss, Bad Boss." It's a follow-up to "The
No Asshole Rule," based on a lot of things

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:37.440
that people wrote in and talked to him about
after that first book was published and he

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.810
tells what's necessary to make a really successful
boss; so something that's particularly relevant

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.220
to our work here at Google. And so without
further ado, please join me in welcoming him

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:47.560
to our Authors at Google Talk.

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:48.560
[applause]

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.460
&gt;&gt;Sutton: Alright, is this thing on? Thank
you, Cliff. So, it's always nice when your

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.280
former students only say the good stuff cause
Cliff knows a lot of bad stuff and do other

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:03.351
people in the audience. So what I'm gonna
do is to talk, as Cliff said, about some of

00:02:03.351 --> 00:02:08.840
the main ideas in this book that just came
out. It actually just came out Tuesday and

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:14.430
it's called "Good Boss, Bad Boss," and following
Cliff's comments, let me set up how I got

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:19.829
interested in this book. So, I guess about
three years ago, I published a book called

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:24.159
"The No Asshole Rule," and I, I guess that
was my fourth book and I've written lots of

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:29.810
different books including this one, but the
level and kind of response that I got to that

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:35.769
book still sort of blows me away. I still,
even now, get stories from all sorts of people

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:41.950
all over the world about either the fact that
they have an asshole that they work with,

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.760
that they're worried about being an asshole
and it just goes on and on. And if you know

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.079
anything about the publishing world, it's
a little bit like the movie business, which

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:54.280
is that if you have a success in that book
sold very well, they want you to do a sequel,

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.280
ok?

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.280
[laughter]

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.420
So, in fact, maybe the highlight of this,
or the camera's on, but I don't care; my French

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:06.049
publisher, she writes me this note and this
is in the introduction to "Good Boss, Bad

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:09.830
Boss." She says, "Dear Bob, when are we going
to see the asshole shits again?"

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:10.830
[laughter]

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:18.150
Cause, and so, so, initially I so under pressure,
I started thinking about writing a sequel,

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:22.590
but as I got into it, I realized two things
that I was kind of sick of writing about assholes;

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:29.389
just assholes frankly. And the other thing
I realized is that, is that essentially if

00:03:29.389 --> 00:03:34.499
you looked through the emails and the conversations
and everything that I was having about it,

00:03:34.499 --> 00:03:39.870
really the central character in those emails
was the boss. It was either, and I went through

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:43.810
and fairly compulsively at one point counted
my emails; it was a lot. And about 80 percent

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:47.279
of the emails, the central character was the
boss. It was either the boss who wanted to

00:03:47.279 --> 00:03:53.669
be better or it was an employee, very often,
who had an asshole boss and in some cases

00:03:53.669 --> 00:03:57.639
I'd have success stories. They moved from
a bad one to a good one or good one to a bad

00:03:57.639 --> 00:04:01.779
one; things like that. But it was always the
central character and the other thing that

00:04:01.779 --> 00:04:08.090
came out in those stories and also in thinking
about the academic literature, is it wasn't

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:13.329
just that people wanted somebody who was nice;
they wanted somebody who was nice and who

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:18.370
was competent, or civilized and competent.
Because if, if that, maybe one of the worst

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:23.301
things in the world is a nice, incompetent
boss because you feel so bad when they're

00:04:23.301 --> 00:04:26.610
incompetent and they're and we gotta fire
them, it's actually really difficult because

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:30.711
you feel so bad; they're such a nice person.
So, so, that idea of nice and competent and,

00:04:30.711 --> 00:04:35.520
in fact, the way that I'd find a good boss
in the book, and this is a definition that

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:41.060
you can see in like, human tribes going way
back, is essentially somebody who is skilled

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:48.020
at both performance, competence and also things
like treating people with respect; the humanity

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:54.810
part. You know the notion of compassion. So,
striking sort of a balance between the two.

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:59.830
So that's how I define them and just sort
of as a footnote, sometimes people say, "What

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:05.210
about those bosses who are real jerks and
are real inhuman and still make a lot of money?"

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:10.490
And my reaction to that is, "That's great.
It's fine if you wanna say that person is

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:14.460
a good boss, but in my value system that person
does not qualify as good human being and they're

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:15.460
still a loser."

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:16.460
[laughter]

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:20.370
So, I'm trying to, if you will, look for the
sort of delicate balance between the two and

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:24.990
I realize that when you're leading people
that's a difficult thing to do. So, that's,

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:30.740
that's kind of a set up for it. So, here's
the book, which is here so you don't have

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:34.360
to, the only thing about it. The one thing
I would say, and you certainly got this in

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:40.860
Cliff's introduction, is for better or worse,
I'm saddled with having been an academic and

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:45.581
publishing in academic journals and being
an editor and stuff and so, the main thing

00:05:45.581 --> 00:05:49.509
I do like if you do time and motion study
of what I do when I write a book, about 75%

00:05:49.509 --> 00:05:55.590
of the time I'm reading peer-reviewed articles,
but I do realize that most human beings don't

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:59.330
like to read peer-reviewed articles. They
are incredibly dulling and dull and boring

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:04.900
and actually not very useful either, although
they have implications for utility. So, what

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:10.319
I try to do was to try to have evidence based
ideas, but to illustrate them with stories

00:06:10.319 --> 00:06:14.851
and in fact, have you ever had Chip Heath
here? For this site, he wrote this great book

00:06:14.851 --> 00:06:17.080
called "Made to Stick." So, pardon me?

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:18.360
&gt;&gt;audience member #1: [inaudible ]

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:22.571
&gt;&gt;Sutton: Oh, he's fabulous, also got a, he's
always in the bestseller list. So, the main,

00:06:22.571 --> 00:06:27.790
the main finding from Chip's book, "Make to
Stick," is it's statistics show that people

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:32.340
don't remember statistics, they remember stories.
So, I'm gonna tell you a lot of stories and

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:36.819
occasionally I will refer to the evidence
that this is based upon and that's why my

00:06:36.819 --> 00:06:40.599
editor, my only complaint about the book is
it has too many endnotes, but I can't help

00:06:40.599 --> 00:06:46.409
it. I was sorta ruined by being an academic.
Alright, so let's start out with a little

00:06:46.409 --> 00:06:52.870
mental provisioning which gets to this evidence
based sort of perspective I take. So, so when

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:57.849
I was putting together the ideas and the perspective
in this book, in some ways I was led by this

00:06:57.849 --> 00:07:02.650
Jimmy Buffet quote, which I'd been following
for a long time, which is that, "Some things

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:07.810
are still a mystery to me and other things
are much too clear." And so, in the world

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:13.259
of management, or whatever you want to call
it, is this whatever, if, if you start looking

00:07:13.259 --> 00:07:17.420
at what I would at least describe from my
biased perspective, the best peer-reviewed

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:22.800
studies. There are certain things that I don't
know the answer to. And I'll give you an example.

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:26.580
It, and the more I read about it, the more
confused I get. Well, two of them. One is,

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:31.050
is there a first mover advantage? Whenever
I read that literature it looks to me like

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:34.940
a random scatterplot. And clearly, I guess
Google will do pretty well at not being a

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:40.439
first mover; how there were a few search engines
around before you guys came around. And then

00:07:40.439 --> 00:07:47.680
another one is, is the performance evaluation
worth doing? So, if you looked across studies

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:52.819
of performance evaluations and suppose you're
trying to get FDA approval for it, as like

00:07:52.819 --> 00:07:57.689
a, as a compound or a treatment. It, you wouldn't
do very well because it sort of looks like

00:07:57.689 --> 00:08:01.729
about half the time it makes things better
and half the time it makes things worse, which

00:08:01.729 --> 00:08:05.169
looks a little bit to me like randomness.
Although, there are some organizations that

00:08:05.169 --> 00:08:10.130
do better with performance evaluations than
other, but my argument is that there are many

00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:14.050
organizations that'd be better off having
no performance evaluations. And I don't know

00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:19.699
how to tell you to do a good performance evaluation
and maybe the most satisfying involvement

00:08:19.699 --> 00:08:24.160
I've ever had with an organization is one
of your former partners, but now kindof a

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:30.610
competitor, which is Mozilla of Firefox Fame
and so they have a very interesting CEO, John

00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:35.930
Lilly, he really does have guts and so he
decided that these performance evaluations

00:08:35.930 --> 00:08:39.589
they were doing were so stupid that he was
gonna get rid of them. So, Mozilla has no

00:08:39.589 --> 00:08:43.289
performance evaluations now. What they do
is they have a system with some much, obviously

00:08:43.289 --> 00:08:48.040
much smaller and simpler organization than
you folks. There's about 12 levels and everybody

00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:52.790
at the same level gets paid the exact same
amount and they have the same bonus amount

00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:57.889
and the only time you go through something
like a performance evaluation is when either

00:08:57.889 --> 00:09:02.390
you go up a level or you're bad; you're on
plan and might be fired. Other than that,

00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:07.899
the emphasis is on moment to moment feedback.
So, I have a cool solution to the problem.

00:09:07.899 --> 00:09:13.139
But the, but that's a digression, but I love
telling that story. But, because, I mean,

00:09:13.139 --> 00:09:17.161
having a CEO who in, in, is the head of HR
did not liked being told to get rid of the

00:09:17.161 --> 00:09:20.440
performance evaluation, by the way, because,
his argument was how am I gonna get a job

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:22.280
somewhere else if we had no performance evaluations?

00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:23.280
[laughter]

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:29.240
Which I think was a little narrow minded.
He's no longer there, by the way. So, anyways,

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:35.160
so the, the main idea and main focus of "Good
Boss, Bad Bos"s is on areas where at least

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:40.029
I think, from looking at the academic literature,
at least it looks to me, not all my academic

00:09:40.029 --> 00:09:47.980
colleagues would agree that there's a clear
picture. So, the main point of the book, in

00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:54.160
some ways, goes contrary to something that
you often hear about good bosses or good leaders.

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:58.300
So, maybe many of you've heard the expression
that it's not all about you. Like, that's

00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:01.649
something they always say to bosses. It's
not all about you. Well, I actually think

00:10:01.649 --> 00:10:07.810
that's a useful half-truth because if you
looked at research on what happens to human

00:10:07.810 --> 00:10:13.130
beings, and in fact apes too, when you put
them in positions of power, actually in many

00:10:13.130 --> 00:10:18.339
ways it does become all about you. It becomes
all about you in a couple of ways. One way

00:10:18.339 --> 00:10:24.089
in which it becomes all about you is that
the people or other creatures that you lead

00:10:24.089 --> 00:10:28.120
start paying enormous amount of attention
to you; much more than you often realize,

00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:32.570
at least based on the experiments and other
studies we see. And then the other reason

00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:37.019
that it's all about you is that the lot in
life where every leader, especially as they

00:10:37.019 --> 00:10:43.160
get more senior, even leaders of small groups,
is your lot in life is you are gonna get more

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:47.389
credit and more blame than you deserve for
the performance of the, of the people you

00:10:47.389 --> 00:10:52.760
lead. And, and it's one of those things that,
I guess, at least two or three times in the

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:58.589
last five or six years I've done very detailed
review of the relationship especially between

00:10:58.589 --> 00:11:03.450
CO action and [inaudible] performance and
there's lots of little nuances and it sort

00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:07.970
of does look like the smaller the organization,
the younger it is, the more that the senior

00:11:07.970 --> 00:11:15.220
management has an impact. But it sort of looks
like the real impact of CO actions is maybe

00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:21.120
ten, maybe fifteen% of the bearance of performance,
but the amount of credit and blame that leaders

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:27.560
get is usually around fifty% . And this works
even if you do little, tiny experimental groups

00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:32.540
that so, so back to this notion that it's
all about you, that when you're in a position

00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:37.140
of leadership, they're looking at you especially
the people you lead more closely than you

00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:42.620
probably realize. And two, you're gonna get
more credit and more blame from everybody

00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:48.899
than you probably deserve. So, in some ways,
it actually is all about you and, in particular,

00:11:48.899 --> 00:11:54.560
I'm not arguing that the best bosses are egomaniac.
What they are is actually quite the opposite.

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:59.389
They're remarkably sensitive to the ways that,
that the actions they take that affect the

00:11:59.389 --> 00:12:06.570
people that they lead in particular. But this
isn't easy because there's this asymmetry

00:12:06.570 --> 00:12:11.450
problem, and this is something that's established
in all sorts of studies that when people are

00:12:11.450 --> 00:12:16.670
in positions of power and the people beneath
them put, pay much more attention to them

00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:21.259
than they pay to their subordinates. So, to
give you an example, one of my favorite stories,

00:12:21.259 --> 00:12:27.710
some of us will remember the dark days of
late 2008, early 2009, even in Silicon Valley,

00:12:27.710 --> 00:12:32.829
firms were laying off people; everybody but
John Larry I knew was laying off, even Google

00:12:32.829 --> 00:12:37.480
had layoffs. My wife, Ceil of the Northern
California Girl Scouts, even she had to lay

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:43.720
off staff members. So, it was a pretty sad
sort of time. So, I, I wrote an article during

00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:48.480
this time on being a good boss in a bad economy
that was in Harvard Business Review. So, being

00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:51.920
this sort of I guess capitalist professor
that I am, I started giving talks about it

00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:58.009
for money and one of the talks I gave was
to a group of project managers at Stanford.

00:12:58.009 --> 00:13:02.279
And after the talk, this guy comes up to me,
he says, "Let me tell you the interesting

00:13:02.279 --> 00:13:09.390
shoes story." So, here's what happened. What
happened was that one of the executive assistants

00:13:09.390 --> 00:13:15.410
walked up to an executive vice president and
said, "When are the layoffs coming?" Well,

00:13:15.410 --> 00:13:19.329
in fact, it was the sort of organization that
had planned layoffs. It was very well hidden,

00:13:19.329 --> 00:13:26.380
it's, just like the lawyers told them to do
kept secret. But the problem was that this

00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:29.639
executive was shocked. He couldn't figure
out how this woman figured out there was gonna

00:13:29.639 --> 00:13:35.370
be layoffs and what she said to him was, "Today
is an interesting shoes day." And so this

00:13:35.370 --> 00:13:39.529
guy had to tell sort of like when you play
poker with someone, when he had bad news,

00:13:39.529 --> 00:13:45.140
he would look at his shoes. And so, they figured
out from that sort of like bit of leakage

00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:49.459
if you've ever read some of Ekman stuff, that
there was some bad news coming and very quickly

00:13:49.459 --> 00:13:54.800
it turned out to be layoffs. So, the reason
I like that story is it sort of really does

00:13:54.800 --> 00:14:02.199
illustrate this asymmetry that I call the
"toxic tandem" that essentially, one of the

00:14:02.199 --> 00:14:07.259
effects of hierarchy is that the people are
creatures at the bot-, at the top, they'll

00:14:07.259 --> 00:14:12.220
pay nearly as much attention to their underlings
as vice versa. So, that's one thing you gotta

00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:17.670
realize is when you're in position of authority,
people are watching you perhaps more closely

00:14:17.670 --> 00:14:23.269
than you might realize. And just as a quick
aside, this happens in apes, too. There's

00:14:23.269 --> 00:14:28.260
sort of some cool studies about baboon troops.
It turns out that the average member of baboon

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:33.880
troop looks up at the boss; the alpha male
every 20 or 30 seconds. So, I'm wondering,

00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:39.660
so you've got these problems in then also,
to make things worse, and one reason I call

00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:45.350
this ,this the toxic tandem, is there's a
lot of evidence that when you put people in

00:14:45.350 --> 00:14:51.019
positions of power, a whole bunch of things
happen to make them insensitive jerks. And

00:14:51.019 --> 00:14:55.250
this is one of the things, there's especially
a researcher at Berkeley named Dr. Keltner

00:14:55.250 --> 00:15:01.350
and another one at Stanford who is, who have
been studying this problem for quite awhile,

00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:06.360
Deborah Gruenfeld's her name, and there's
probably a couple hundred peer-reviewed studies

00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:11.570
that show, essentially, that when you give
people power over others, they tend to focus

00:15:11.570 --> 00:15:17.040
more on their own needs and concerns. They
focus little attention on the needs of others

00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:21.769
and they act like the rules don't apply to
them. And maybe this is politically incorrect

00:15:21.769 --> 00:15:26.130
to say or something, but I think Mark Hurd's
behavior, I think it applies to all three

00:15:26.130 --> 00:15:32.459
of those; the sort of things that got him
fired. I really wonder how cognizant he was

00:15:32.459 --> 00:15:37.829
of the, like if you keep taking a gorgeous
woman to dinner who doesn't have a very high-level

00:15:37.829 --> 00:15:40.830
position and you're a CEO of a company like
that, and you're married, I think people notice

00:15:40.830 --> 00:15:47.990
and talk about you. So, anyway, so, this is
sort of a classic sort of pattern and to show

00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:52.639
you what for me is not probably the most rigorous
study, but is certainly the most entertaining

00:15:52.639 --> 00:15:58.879
power poisoning study, this is the cookie
study, which Keltner reports. And essentially

00:15:58.879 --> 00:16:04.960
what is, this is, is a study where you have
three Berkeley students and they will brainstorming

00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:10.259
about a social problem; things like how you
make the UC campus more green. Two of them

00:16:10.259 --> 00:16:15.129
were brainstormers, one was the boss evaluating
what happened, but the key intervention was

00:16:15.129 --> 00:16:22.250
about halfway through the conversation the
experimenter brought in a plate of five cookies.

00:16:22.250 --> 00:16:26.690
Now, we all know the social norm that you
don't eat the last cookie. So, the interesting

00:16:26.690 --> 00:16:31.310
question is well, what happened to cookie
number four? OK? And so here's what happened.

00:16:31.310 --> 00:16:37.010
So, this is a study of disinhibited eating,
right? So, those with will power they detained

00:16:37.010 --> 00:16:48.250
to take the fourth cookie. They tend to eat
with their mouths open because they did the

00:16:48.250 --> 00:16:49.250
video tape.

00:16:49.250 --> 00:16:50.250
[laughter]

00:16:50.250 --> 00:16:53.829
places. And, and so the intercorrelation among
these three measures of disinhibited eating

00:16:53.829 --> 00:16:58.960
was point eight, which was pretty darn good,
actually. And, but, but if you go back to

00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:03.810
my three things: one, more focused on your
own needs, less than the needs of others and

00:17:03.810 --> 00:17:08.600
the rules don't apply to me, it's really quite
interesting. The other thing I should do for

00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:11.640
both the men and the women in the audience
is describe the gender effects. It turned

00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:16.720
out the men did get somewhat worse, but what
really drew, when they were given power, but

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:21.960
what really drove the study was the women
who were actually pretty civilized when they

00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:26.360
were in the lower power positions, but they
became as bad a pigs as the men when you gave

00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:31.419
them power. So, the game score for the women
was much higher for disinhibited eating. But,

00:17:31.419 --> 00:17:35.490
this is sort of a cute study, but the reason
that I think it's important and the reason

00:17:35.490 --> 00:17:39.650
I bring it up is one of the core ideas in
the book is this challenge when you're in

00:17:39.650 --> 00:17:45.190
a position of authority of others and people
always talk to you about a world without authority,

00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:48.510
but I've never been in an organization where
there were not power and status differences.

00:17:48.510 --> 00:17:52.290
Maybe yours is the one that doesn't, but there
are those, some of those people like Larry

00:17:52.290 --> 00:17:59.010
and Sergey who seem to have some power. And,
and these characters succ-, are things happen

00:17:59.010 --> 00:18:04.409
to about everybody who is in power and there's
this challenge of the most effective bosses

00:18:04.409 --> 00:18:08.760
are in tune with what it feels like to work
for them, but a whole bunch of contraveiling

00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:16.960
forces make it difficult to actually experience
that state. Ok, so that's the set-up. What

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:21.231
I would do, and I want to make sure and leave
at least five or ten minutes for a question,

00:18:21.231 --> 00:18:26.480
is to talk about some of the hallmarks of
in tune bosses. And so let me let me start

00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:31.760
with a first one and there's some really cool
research around this done by Frank Flynn who's

00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:36.429
at the Stanford Business School and some researchers
at Columbia, and it's on assertiveness. And

00:18:36.429 --> 00:18:42.270
what they've been doing is a series of surveys
and experiments where they show that the best

00:18:42.270 --> 00:18:47.660
bosses sort of get, are in the middle, in
the median of being things like competitive,

00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:54.710
aggressive, passive, and submissive; so they're
moderately assertive. And also, and by the

00:18:54.710 --> 00:18:58.770
way, some of the research shows that being,
if you will, being perfectly assertive is

00:18:58.770 --> 00:19:05.530
more important for example, than how charismatic
you are. The amount of variance explained

00:19:05.530 --> 00:19:12.030
looks pretty good. And the point they make,
which I really like, is one of the problems

00:19:12.030 --> 00:19:16.650
with being a perfectly assertive boss, about
not being too pushy or not being pushy enough,

00:19:16.650 --> 00:19:21.299
is that, is that people don't notice it because
you're not a jerk or you're not ignoring them

00:19:21.299 --> 00:19:25.990
too much. So, it's actually, they've got this
analogy, it's like a perfectly salted dish;

00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:31.400
you don't notice it, the amount of salt. And
then the other thing that they emphasize is

00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:37.850
it's not like the best bosses are medium all
the time. They have that ability to read people

00:19:37.850 --> 00:19:43.920
again to be in tune with people to know when
to push, to know when to back off and, I guess

00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:50.170
I was at, I gave this talk at Disney Studios
on Tuesday, a variation of it. And one of

00:19:50.170 --> 00:19:55.460
the people from Disney Studios raised her
hand and said, "How do I know when I'm perfectly

00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:59.830
assertive? What guidelines can you give me?"
And my answer to that is that's one of those

00:19:59.830 --> 00:20:05.340
places, although I take an evidence-based
approach to management and business, in the

00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:11.260
end, a little bit like Madison, it's a craft
that you act-, you can use evidence to inform

00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:16.049
your decision, but in the end that, it takes
a lot of experience to be able to do it well,

00:20:16.049 --> 00:20:20.830
so no matter how many books your surgeon has
read about how to do the surgery, the more

00:20:20.830 --> 00:20:24.400
operations he or she has done, the less likely
you are to die. This is something that's quite

00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:32.130
well established. So, it is a craft that takes
time to learn. One little quote to sort of

00:20:32.130 --> 00:20:37.130
back this up, although I'm San Francisco Giants
fan, this is the famous Tommy Lasorda, one

00:20:37.130 --> 00:20:42.170
of the most entertaining coaches in baseball
in a long time, he was manager of the Badgers

00:20:42.170 --> 00:20:45.620
for about 20 years; still works for the Dodger
organization. In fact, I think he's worked

00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:50.159
for the organization for about 50 years. He
made this great quote the day he took over

00:20:50.159 --> 00:20:55.210
managing the Dodgers, which is, "I believe
managing is like holding a dove in your hand.

00:20:55.210 --> 00:20:59.720
If you hold it too tightly you kill it, but
if you hold it too loosely, you lose it."

00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:05.610
So, it's this idea of pushing just hard enough
all the time. And again, to be able to do

00:21:05.610 --> 00:21:10.679
that, I think it comes back to one being in
tune with the people you lead, and two knowing

00:21:10.679 --> 00:21:16.570
the work that lead well enough to know when
to push and when to back off. Problem: one

00:21:16.570 --> 00:21:23.590
of the main times when bosses should probably
back off is especially when they're leading

00:21:23.590 --> 00:21:31.200
creative work. There's a lot of evidence that
when you evaluate and watch people too closely,

00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:35.090
when they're doing creative work it causes
a bunch of problems because not only does

00:21:35.090 --> 00:21:40.240
interrupting them with questions slow them
down a lot, when you start evaluating them

00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:45.309
more closely, they start becoming afraid to
fail. So, they sort of drift back to the tried

00:21:45.309 --> 00:21:52.120
and true. And one of, I like my favorite bosses
or one of my favorite quotes I've heard about

00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:57.570
this, it's from Bill Coyne. He led R&amp;D at
3M for a decade, "After you plant a seed in

00:21:57.570 --> 00:22:03.480
the ground you don't go dig it up every week
to see how it is doing." And the place where

00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:10.040
I heard Bill Coyne say this was at, it was,
it was Motorola, this must have been about

00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:14.570
2002 or so; he just stepped down and we're
doing a panel for a couple of hundred people

00:22:14.570 --> 00:22:19.929
and the great thing about former CAs and Senior
Executives is they sometimes become very honest

00:22:19.929 --> 00:22:25.830
and, and he said this thing which just amazed
me because 3M is, in fact like, you have like

00:22:25.830 --> 00:22:31.730
the 20% rule, the 15% rule sort of model,
isn't that, is it the 20% or 15? That's modeled

00:22:31.730 --> 00:22:38.929
after 3M's 15% rule and really one of model
of creative organizations and this was like

00:22:38.929 --> 00:22:43.660
2002; that's, they were in like, the hop,
the top of their era so he, but he said even

00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:48.320
though he was running R&amp;D at 3M, there was
a problem with senior executives, which was

00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:53.140
that when you brought them stuff to soon though,
it would screw it up. And so, he described,

00:22:53.140 --> 00:22:57.470
it's a, I couldn't believe he said this, he
described how part of my job was to bring

00:22:57.470 --> 00:23:03.280
the top management team pretty, shiny things
that would excite them that I would distract

00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:04.799
them from the really important work.

00:23:04.799 --> 00:23:05.799
[laughter]

00:23:05.799 --> 00:23:09.100
This is like, and this is like, and by the
way, it had almost the same story at HP during

00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:12.490
their heyday, too, or I don't know what their
heyday was, but during a period when they

00:23:12.490 --> 00:23:17.559
were doing well. Ok, the second one is for
my students who have been around, I've been

00:23:17.559 --> 00:23:21.880
talking about this forever and this is the
notion of wisdom, so Jeff Pfeffer and I, my

00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:28.150
co-author and I had worked on this a lot.
And, and the basic challenge here is there's

00:23:28.150 --> 00:23:33.169
a lot of evidence that the most effective
bosses and leaders instill confidence in their

00:23:33.169 --> 00:23:39.490
followers, but the problem with instilling
confidence in your followers is that sometimes

00:23:39.490 --> 00:23:44.559
you turn arrogant and start believing your
own bullshit a little bit too much. So, so,

00:23:44.559 --> 00:23:48.950
the challenge to be a good boss is to be confident
enough, so this notion of dancing at the edge

00:23:48.950 --> 00:23:55.299
of overconfidence without turning pigheaded,
psychologists and philosophers call this the

00:23:55.299 --> 00:24:01.620
attitude to wisdom, so it's the courage to
act on what you know in concert with the humility

00:24:01.620 --> 00:24:08.350
to doubt your assumptions and actions. It's
a hard thing to learn; it's easy to say. But

00:24:08.350 --> 00:24:13.220
good example of it, and maybe my favorite
quote from any former CEO, this is also sort

00:24:13.220 --> 00:24:19.370
of came out after he stepped down and this
was a interview that I went to, it was somewhere

00:24:19.370 --> 00:24:24.600
in Palo Alto, no, in Mountain View or something
that was at a Harvard Business School conference

00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:29.230
and Andy Grove was interviewed and there's
all, there's like three dissertations in this,

00:24:29.230 --> 00:24:34.660
in this quote. So, the first one is a pretty
good definition of the attitude of wisdom.

00:24:34.660 --> 00:24:38.779
"I think it's very important for you to do
two things, act on your temporary conviction

00:24:38.779 --> 00:24:44.070
as if it was a real conviction; and when you
realize you are wrong, correct course very

00:24:44.070 --> 00:24:48.441
quickly." So, that's the confidence and humility.
And then he goes on to say essentially you

00:24:48.441 --> 00:24:53.310
don't have time to test everything in massive
detail. You gotta sort of clean up, make decisions

00:24:53.310 --> 00:24:58.029
and clean them up later. And then he said
something which kind of amazes me and it's

00:24:58.029 --> 00:25:03.690
one of those things that I've been thinking
about for a long time. "So you have to keep

00:25:03.690 --> 00:25:07.480
up, you have to keep up your own spirits,
even though you well understand that you don't

00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:13.950
know what you're doing." So this is like one
of the most famous CEOs and essentially he's

00:25:13.950 --> 00:25:18.920
saying that to be an effective leader, you've
got to act more confident in what you're doing

00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:24.799
than you actually feel in many cases. And
on one hand this bothers me because it's potentially

00:25:24.799 --> 00:25:29.610
unethical. He's telling you to exaggerate.
On the other hand, there's this thing called

00:25:29.610 --> 00:25:35.299
the self-fulfilling prophecy. And it turns
out that on average, the most effective leaders

00:25:35.299 --> 00:25:42.289
probably do this. Exhibit one for our country,
the United States is probably George Washington.

00:25:42.289 --> 00:25:47.190
If you read David McCullough's "1776", George
had a little trouble quite knowing what he

00:25:47.190 --> 00:25:51.330
was doing when he first took the job. He got
better as he went along, but he was always

00:25:51.330 --> 00:25:54.779
was on that white horse and he had the great
uniform and he was always clean; most of his

00:25:54.779 --> 00:25:59.310
soldiers were filthy. And he always acted
confident in a sort of confident, sort of

00:25:59.310 --> 00:26:04.730
front-stage; no matter how things were, how
screwed up things were, but he had that ability

00:26:04.730 --> 00:26:09.429
to learn from his mistakes and to listen to
the people who were on, if you will, his senior

00:26:09.429 --> 00:26:13.520
team and his soldiers to improve as he went
along. So, so I would make an argument that

00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:18.100
on average, although arrogance should not
be able to adjust as bad, you probably want

00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:21.919
a leader who's a little bit more confident
than is warranted, assuming they don't have

00:26:21.919 --> 00:26:28.490
the rigidity problem. OK, so sort of moving
along with wisdom, one of the key things for

00:26:28.490 --> 00:26:33.029
wisdom is to actually be able to listen. Here's
a nice quote from John Wooden. I, I think

00:26:33.029 --> 00:26:40.130
the key quote here is "faking it is worse
than not doing it at all." And one of my favorite

00:26:40.130 --> 00:26:44.960
examples that sort of gets to this, so this
happened about a year and a half ago, one

00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:49.930
of my colleagues at Stanford named Huggy Rao,
Hayagreeva Rao, we were at an all day meeting

00:26:49.930 --> 00:26:54.510
with a quite famous organization. I can't
name them because if you look at the NDA I

00:26:54.510 --> 00:26:58.930
signed with them, they would shoot me if I
named them, but at least it had to do with

00:26:58.930 --> 00:27:03.590
lawyers, so we're in this all day meeting
and what happened was there was one guy who

00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:08.299
was the most senior person in the room; he
did all the talking. He talked and he talked

00:27:08.299 --> 00:27:11.890
and he talked. And I was sitting next to a
more junior person; the junior person's actually

00:27:11.890 --> 00:27:18.169
my client and she kept whispering in my ear
the PowerPoint text that he was spewing out.

00:27:18.169 --> 00:27:22.440
So, it's like, you think about the worst meeting
you've ever been to, one of the horrible meetings.

00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:27.760
So, finally about 2 o'clock, he sits down
next to me, he was quiet and then he looks

00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:32.580
at me and he says, "It looks like I'm listening,
but I'm not listening. I'm reloading. I'm

00:27:32.580 --> 00:27:36.929
trying to think of what I'm gonna say next."
And if you think about that, so literally,

00:27:36.929 --> 00:27:40.791
even though he was listening, he wasn't even
listening, he was thinking about spewing out

00:27:40.791 --> 00:27:45.260
more stuff. It, one of the most destructive
meetings ever met, and by the way, it's not

00:27:45.260 --> 00:27:50.769
like people didn't notice him. There was emails
flying around all over the place that this

00:27:50.769 --> 00:27:56.110
guy was all transmission and no reception
and it, and this is a well round enough organization

00:27:56.110 --> 00:27:58.909
that it got back to other senior people and
he got slapped around a little bit for his

00:27:58.909 --> 00:28:05.289
behavior, so I will give them a little courage
for not being a terrible organization. Another

00:28:05.289 --> 00:28:12.179
issue, which gets in the way of the attitude
of wisdom, is when people create a fear-based

00:28:12.179 --> 00:28:18.230
environment. We were talking about this a
little bit before. When you create a situation

00:28:18.230 --> 00:28:23.519
where people are afraid to criticize you,
you as a boss have all sorts of problems.

00:28:23.519 --> 00:28:28.179
Exhibit one, if you've read any of the stuff
by Michael Lewis, on the meltdown, as usual,

00:28:28.179 --> 00:28:32.410
he's like the best author. There was a great
Vanity Fair article where he talked about

00:28:32.410 --> 00:28:40.059
Joe Cassano. So, of course, it's over simplistic
tip, blame the meltdown on any one person.

00:28:40.059 --> 00:28:44.130
If you wanted to pick on someone, Joe Cassano
would probably be your guy if you read Michael

00:28:44.130 --> 00:28:50.539
Lewis. He was head of the unit at AIG that
lost 45 billion dollars, but I guess they

00:28:50.539 --> 00:28:55.399
were into them for about 200 billion dollars;
180 billion dollars in tax money, so it isn't

00:28:55.399 --> 00:29:00.020
all his fault but he was infamous for his
arrogance and insecurity, so "the fear level

00:29:00.020 --> 00:29:04.789
was so high, if you were critical of the organization
all hell would break loose." And I love this

00:29:04.789 --> 00:29:09.390
was, "The way you dealt with Joe was to start
everything by saying, 'You're right, Joe.'"

00:29:09.390 --> 00:29:12.940
And, in fact, if you're the kind of boss and
people always say, "You're right," that's

00:29:12.940 --> 00:29:19.070
a pretty good sign that maybe you're doing
something wrong. And also, there's another

00:29:19.070 --> 00:29:23.940
effect which is more subtle and now Google
is big enough, you might want to think about

00:29:23.940 --> 00:29:28.399
this a little bit, and this is this thing
called the Mum effect. So, there's a bunch

00:29:28.399 --> 00:29:33.400
of psychological experiments and we start
with the experiments that, in general, even

00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:37.230
if you're like the nice, you've got the nicest
boss in the world and you're the nicest person,

00:29:37.230 --> 00:29:42.970
when we break bad news to people, they like
us less. And it's just got to do with the

00:29:42.970 --> 00:29:47.610
emotion of it. Like, you associate this person
with negative emotion and I think that partly

00:29:47.610 --> 00:29:52.971
as a result of that, many of us learn to sugar
coat the bad news a little bit and if you

00:29:52.971 --> 00:29:57.720
start going up the hierarchy and think about
the effects of all that sugarcoating, some

00:29:57.720 --> 00:30:04.909
pretty bad things can happen. And one of my
favorite examples is that some of us may be

00:30:04.909 --> 00:30:09.760
old enough to remember a guy named Richard
Fineman, a Nobel Prize winning physicist;

00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:13.929
he was in the Rogers Commission and the purpose
of the Rogers Commission was to try to figure

00:30:13.929 --> 00:30:20.470
out the cause of the explosion of the challenge,
the Challenger Space Shuttle. As a side story,

00:30:20.470 --> 00:30:26.159
he actually figured it out and did this dramatic
demonstration at Congress and put a piece

00:30:26.159 --> 00:30:32.960
of the tubing from the rockets into a beaker
of ice and then he broke it in front of them

00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:36.250
and said, "I think this is the cause of the
problem." And it was. But one of the things

00:30:36.250 --> 00:30:41.299
that he did when he was running around this
unauthorized stuff was he asked this question,

00:30:41.299 --> 00:30:45.860
which is, "What is the probability that the
main shuttle engine would fail?" And the engineers

00:30:45.860 --> 00:30:54.740
at the bottom of the hierarchy estimated one
in two hundred, and the bosses at the top

00:30:54.740 --> 00:30:56.669
estimated one in a hundred thousand. And we,
and I, I would like to see the numbers and

00:30:56.669 --> 00:31:02.120
we don't have the numbers, but we have some
hints of what happened with that BP Oil deck

00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:06.110
that blew up. I bet you would get similar
numbers because there's a lot of evidence

00:31:06.110 --> 00:31:10.610
that the top BP executives were saying that
the likelihood of what happened was virtually

00:31:10.610 --> 00:31:17.940
impossible. And it did happen. And then the
final thing about the attitude of wisdom is

00:31:17.940 --> 00:31:23.470
that if you want to create an environment
where, if you will, people have the courage

00:31:23.470 --> 00:31:29.090
to act on their knowledge and humility and
to doubt it, one of the most important things

00:31:29.090 --> 00:31:33.652
is to create an environment where people feel
safe to fight. So, the idea is to fight as

00:31:33.652 --> 00:31:38.440
if you're right and listen as if you're wrong.
One of my favorite quotes and one that's a

00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:43.140
little more complicated than it seems is that
"When two people in business always agree,

00:31:43.140 --> 00:31:44.880
one of them is unnecessary."

00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:46.870
[laughter]

00:31:46.870 --> 00:31:53.110
It's cute, but it's actually, I describe as
a useful half-truth because there are many

00:31:53.110 --> 00:31:57.149
times when you don't want people fighting,
you don't want people fighting when they're

00:31:57.149 --> 00:32:01.470
flying in the airplane, when they're doing
a routine surgical procedure on you. Sometimes

00:32:01.470 --> 00:32:06.710
it's time to fight and sometimes it's time
to stop fighting and bond together. Another

00:32:06.710 --> 00:32:14.210
example, one of my favorite people I've ever
interviewed is Brad Bird of Pixar. Actually,

00:32:14.210 --> 00:32:18.940
I gave a version of this talk yesterday at
Pixar and rather than saying like I'm saying

00:32:18.940 --> 00:32:23.679
to you, that he feeds constructive conflict.
I said, "Does he feed constructive conflict?"

00:32:23.679 --> 00:32:26.890
And there was actually one of his producers
was there and talked about how funny he was

00:32:26.890 --> 00:32:30.800
to work with because it was all fighting and
all friendly all the time. And, in fact, if

00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:35.279
you look at some of the extra material from
the Incredible's DVD, you can see a lot of

00:32:35.279 --> 00:32:39.669
constructive conflict that he was involved
in. So, anyhow, when, when we interviewed

00:32:39.669 --> 00:32:45.020
him, Huggy Rao and I, we interviewed him for
the McKinsey Quarterly, he described how when

00:32:45.020 --> 00:32:50.480
he took a over a movie, a movie some of you
may have seen called The Iron Giant, which

00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:56.380
was critically reviewed very positively, but
didn't do great at the box office, so it was

00:32:56.380 --> 00:33:00.389
a sort of like a messed up team. And he said,
"I came in the first day and I gave them this

00:33:00.389 --> 00:33:04.909
fantastic speech about how we should be arguing
with each other all the time and I was gonna

00:33:04.909 --> 00:33:09.779
be safe to do it." And like this line, "Everyone
will get humiliated and encouraged together."

00:33:09.779 --> 00:33:12.399
And he said it was one of the best speeches
I ever gave because he's sort of that kind

00:33:12.399 --> 00:33:18.649
of guy who will be all exuberant. And he said,
"Then, they stared at me for three weeks."

00:33:18.649 --> 00:33:19.649
[laughter]

00:33:19.649 --> 00:33:22.779
"And I'd be like, drawing on the board and
asking for help and they'd be," he said, "I

00:33:22.779 --> 00:33:27.880
realized that I was teaching a group of abused
school children." It was just, like literally,

00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:31.810
an abused family. And he said that finally
after about three or four weeks, one of them

00:33:31.810 --> 00:33:35.880
raised their hand and said, "Brad, I think
you're wrong." And he said, "I built on that

00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:40.011
little kernel within a couple of months; it
was actually pretty much rocking and rolling

00:33:40.011 --> 00:33:46.371
and we were arguing." But the reason I like
that story is, so, I, as a management professor,

00:33:46.371 --> 00:33:50.350
it's very easy to say, "Go have constructive
conflict," but if you don't have the trust

00:33:50.350 --> 00:33:54.830
to do it, it's not something that's easily
accomplished. And I will say that Brad, he

00:33:54.830 --> 00:34:00.830
was self-deprecating and funny at the same
time. Two quick caveats: Don't fight in the

00:34:00.830 --> 00:34:05.500
early stage of idea generation if you're in
a brainstorming session. Arguing about the

00:34:05.500 --> 00:34:10.890
ideas then it's probably too early and I've
already implied this. Whoops. When you're

00:34:10.890 --> 00:34:17.030
in the implementation phase, you should probably
stop fighting because that's pretty destructive.

00:34:17.030 --> 00:34:23.420
And Andy Grove has a pretty good bit of advice
here, which is that you should especially

00:34:23.420 --> 00:34:27.980
work hard to implement ideas that you think
are completely wrong. And the reason he gives

00:34:27.980 --> 00:34:32.710
is, that way when it fails, there's now no
doubt that it was because it was about a bad

00:34:32.710 --> 00:34:36.800
implementation. And I think that's sort of
like a cute thing and, and in general, if

00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:40.230
you ever, if you're ever in a project with
somebody who thinks that you're doing something

00:34:40.230 --> 00:34:44.080
that's a bad idea, sometimes they accidently
undermine it or maybe on purpose undermine

00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:50.150
it constantly. And so I like the Andy Grove
sort of argument there. Alright, so the next

00:34:50.150 --> 00:34:55.050
one, how am I doing on time? I may, I will
probably skip at least one. Let me skip this

00:34:55.050 --> 00:35:00.410
one because I want to make sure, so, I'll
give you the short version. So, the basic

00:35:00.410 --> 00:35:04.750
idea here is another thing and this comes
from some work that my colleague, Jeff Pfeffer,

00:35:04.750 --> 00:35:09.850
and I did on turning knowledge into action.
One of the problems that organizations have

00:35:09.850 --> 00:35:15.840
and bosses have when they have trouble with
performance issues is when they unwittingly

00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:21.410
start rewording smart talk rather than smart
action. And so, Jeff and I had been studying

00:35:21.410 --> 00:35:26.580
this for a long time. The example of the first
management team I studied to sort of abbreviate

00:35:26.580 --> 00:35:31.230
it was when I was a brand new full professor
and therefore, had so much job security; it

00:35:31.230 --> 00:35:35.290
was almost impossible to fire me. I started
doing consulting finally; actually didn't

00:35:35.290 --> 00:35:41.340
consult until I got too much job security.
And the first team I worked with was the top

00:35:41.340 --> 00:35:46.250
management team of a Fortune 200 company and
I was amazed how they would constantly make

00:35:46.250 --> 00:35:49.970
decisions and not implement them. And one
of those decisions which they still have not

00:35:49.970 --> 00:35:53.470
implemented was to put the name of their product
on their product.

00:35:53.470 --> 00:35:54.470
[laughter]

00:35:54.470 --> 00:35:58.520
So, my colleague, Jeff Pfeffer, and I started
realizing that there's some weird times in

00:35:58.520 --> 00:36:03.460
organizational life when you get reworded
or people will say smart things and not actually

00:36:03.460 --> 00:36:10.280
do them. And to sort of skip ahead, how do
you overcome it? It turns out that people

00:36:10.280 --> 00:36:15.220
who manage the work, who actually understand
it, tend to be much more effective. So, it's

00:36:15.220 --> 00:36:19.720
one thing I sort of like start thinking about
some of the most successful tech organizations.

00:36:19.720 --> 00:36:22.960
Well, your founders, you can't argue that
they don't understand the technology since

00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:28.010
they invented it. Bill Gates is a pretty weird
guy, but you can't argue that he doesn't understand

00:36:28.010 --> 00:36:33.060
the technology. Larry Ellison's even weirder,
but he sure understands his company and then

00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:37.610
Steve Jobs probably knows what's going on,
too. And you sort of go down the list, it

00:36:37.610 --> 00:36:42.590
turns out that managing stuff that you understand,
there tends to be less smart talk because

00:36:42.590 --> 00:36:48.080
the boss is harder to fool. Oh, and the Bill
George story is, when Bill George took over

00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:53.950
as CO Medtronic and I, I interviewed him about
this, he had never known anything about medical

00:36:53.950 --> 00:36:58.040
device companies and he did something that
was a lot different, for example, than what

00:36:58.040 --> 00:37:04.100
Carly Fiorina did when she took over HP; he
spent 75% of his time, the first nine months,

00:37:04.100 --> 00:37:09.490
in hospitals, talking to surgeons, watching
surgery, talking to procurement officers or

00:37:09.490 --> 00:37:16.610
very important medical device industry to
understand the work that he was managing.

00:37:16.610 --> 00:37:20.140
Another thing is whining; I don't go into
that in detail, but whining is pretty destructive

00:37:20.140 --> 00:37:24.820
when people turn all their energy to trying
to say how everything sucks rather than to

00:37:24.820 --> 00:37:31.410
try to make it better. Simple language and
simple action, at the same time we got all

00:37:31.410 --> 00:37:35.550
the crazy mortgage stuff going on with the
banks. You have A. G. Lafley running Proctor

00:37:35.550 --> 00:37:43.760
and Gamble and his motto was, "Keep it Sesame
Street simple." And if anybody has ever met

00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:48.870
A.G. Lafley, he talks to you like you're a
seven year old. It's like Mr. Rogers. Remember

00:37:48.870 --> 00:37:54.400
those who were kids during Sesame Street?
And, and that sort of, and, and it sort of,

00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:58.510
Proctor and Gamble was things like the customer
is boss or the customer is king, but then

00:37:58.510 --> 00:38:02.831
they'd make billion dollar decisions in the
basis of a very simple approach. And then

00:38:02.831 --> 00:38:08.350
to talk about, well now an easier competitor,
an interesting thing, example, of keeping

00:38:08.350 --> 00:38:14.060
it simple is to look at what happened when
Jobs took over as then acting CEO of Apple

00:38:14.060 --> 00:38:21.470
in 1997. And this is actually just a partial
list of the hardware they had and so, he would

00:38:21.470 --> 00:38:27.750
walk around and he would say, "Well, why would
I buy a Performa 5400 rather than 8600?" And

00:38:27.750 --> 00:38:31.780
as the quote said, "We couldn't even tell
our friends which ones to buy." And one of

00:38:31.780 --> 00:38:36.310
the things that Jobs did was in one year,
all the hardware was gone that they had just

00:38:36.310 --> 00:38:40.550
the year before when they got there and they
went to a simple two by two laptop, desktop,

00:38:40.550 --> 00:38:44.570
home office. And they still have got a pretty
simple product line, actually, if you look

00:38:44.570 --> 00:38:49.270
at how much stuff they sell. So, that's an
argument for what it takes to turn knowledge

00:38:49.270 --> 00:38:55.070
into action. So, I sped through that fast
enough. I think we're back on time. The last

00:38:55.070 --> 00:39:01.130
two points is something I thought about a
lot when I was working on this book, which

00:39:01.130 --> 00:39:06.930
is the notion that what the best bosses do,
and you can kind of oversimplify this, is

00:39:06.930 --> 00:39:11.541
like, where should you spend your time? Eliminating
the negative or accentuating the positive?

00:39:11.541 --> 00:39:16.390
And the accentuating the positive is probably
a lot more fun, but at least if you look at

00:39:16.390 --> 00:39:21.110
the evidence, at least as I understand the
evidence, you probably should focus on eliminating

00:39:21.110 --> 00:39:27.340
the negative first and so, let me talk a little
bit about this. So, so, so first off, with

00:39:27.340 --> 00:39:33.300
superstars, the question that I like to ask
when I look at organizations to figure out

00:39:33.300 --> 00:39:37.330
whether or not the bosses breeding the right
people or the organization is good at turning

00:39:37.330 --> 00:39:41.970
knowledge into action, is I ask, "Who are
your superstars?" Like, what would you define

00:39:41.970 --> 00:39:46.490
the standard superstar and one thing that
Jeff Pfeffer and I figured out after looking

00:39:46.490 --> 00:39:51.690
at compensation systems a lot, is that although
though vary wildly, so you might have something

00:39:51.690 --> 00:39:57.260
like the General Electric compensation system
where 80% of the goodies go to the top 20%

00:39:57.260 --> 00:40:03.510
pretty consistently or I saw somebody in the
back wearing an IDEO t-shirt. So, IDEO was

00:40:03.510 --> 00:40:07.870
a company; a design consultancy, an innovation
consultancy, I've worked with them a lot.

00:40:07.870 --> 00:40:12.410
IDEO has a really socialistic reward system
actually, by the standards of many organizations.

00:40:12.410 --> 00:40:17.330
But, when we look across organizations that
tend to be well managed, the way that they

00:40:17.330 --> 00:40:22.320
define superstars are people who not only,
if you will, push their individual agenda

00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:28.042
ahead, they have others around them succeed.
And to give you an example of this, one of

00:40:28.042 --> 00:40:34.500
my favorite examples my colleague, Jeff Pfeffer
and co-author, he went to Suit's University

00:40:34.500 --> 00:40:39.320
for Men's Warehouse. How many of you know
what Men's Warehouse is? It's like that guy,

00:40:39.320 --> 00:40:43.870
I bet you not many people shop at Men's Warehouse
at Google because you don't need to dress

00:40:43.870 --> 00:40:44.870
like that.

00:40:44.870 --> 00:40:45.870
[laughter]

00:40:45.870 --> 00:40:48.930
But, but Men's Warehouse, the idea of Men's
Warehouse is, of course, to sell suits to

00:40:48.930 --> 00:40:54.390
men who don't want to be there in the first
place; that's the basic model. And one of

00:40:54.390 --> 00:40:59.020
the things they do in their compensation and
norm system is they have sort of a cruel system

00:40:59.020 --> 00:41:03.850
where there's one salesperson who is getting
the money at the moment, who's getting, who's

00:41:03.850 --> 00:41:09.340
getting the incentive, but everybody in the
store is expected to help sustain the team

00:41:09.340 --> 00:41:15.050
selling environment. And, and they're pretty
serious about doing this. As an example, in

00:41:15.050 --> 00:41:20.221
their Seattle store, you had one guy who kept
stealing sales so they fired him and when

00:41:20.221 --> 00:41:24.070
they fired him, the interesting thing is that
no individual salesperson reached the same

00:41:24.070 --> 00:41:30.320
level of performance, but the store sales
went up 30% overall. So, that's a good example,

00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:36.850
if you will, getting rid of a rotten apple
and that brings me to my next point, which

00:41:36.850 --> 00:41:41.690
is that there's a lot of evidence that bad
is stronger than good. So, in fact, this is

00:41:41.690 --> 00:41:46.000
an academic article that was published in
the Psychological Review. That's the title

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:53.780
and the basic argument is that negative events,
people and so on pack such app compared to

00:41:53.780 --> 00:41:59.980
positive ones, it's unbelievable. And a great
one is the research on personal relationships.

00:41:59.980 --> 00:42:05.540
It turns out that in marriage, dating relationships,
and other personal relationships, that when

00:42:05.540 --> 00:42:12.560
things slip below five to one, so for every
good interaction, for every bad interaction,

00:42:12.560 --> 00:42:17.000
there's less than five good interactions;
the chance of divorce, breaking up gets very

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:21.700
high. So, I always remember this in dealing
with my wife, which is when I've been bad

00:42:21.700 --> 00:42:25.530
I figure I gotta at least make up five times
and, and if you look at the research, five

00:42:25.530 --> 00:42:31.390
is the minimum. You should really aim for
ten. But, but the general point is that, if

00:42:31.390 --> 00:42:37.690
you will, bad is stronger than good and some
of the best research is actually, This American

00:42:37.690 --> 00:42:42.620
Life episode in this you can listen to, was
done and reviewed by a guy named Will Felps

00:42:42.620 --> 00:42:47.120
and he looked at the group dynamics literature
and essentially, showed that different sort

00:42:47.120 --> 00:42:53.700
of negative characters, so what I would call
assholes, deadbeats, depressive people, they

00:42:53.700 --> 00:42:59.350
would pretty consistently bring down performance
30 or 40% than if they had just one. And there's

00:42:59.350 --> 00:43:04.110
two basic mechanisms that the researchers
talk about; about why this happens. The first

00:43:04.110 --> 00:43:08.750
one is, is you've got somebody who's really
destructive in your group; you basically spend

00:43:08.750 --> 00:43:13.530
an inordinate amount of time dealing with
the person. So, you're distracted from performance,

00:43:13.530 --> 00:43:17.830
that may sound familiar to some of you, and
then the second thing is that it's contagious.

00:43:17.830 --> 00:43:22.770
Bad behavior is contagious. So, like you catch
the evilness. So the argument here is that

00:43:22.770 --> 00:43:27.830
although, if you will, eliminating the negative
is not as much fun as accentuating the positive.

00:43:27.830 --> 00:43:31.470
If you're a boss, you might want to deal with,
if you will, the problems and the shit first

00:43:31.470 --> 00:43:37.900
because that's where you can have the biggest
impact. So, let me take, give me five more

00:43:37.900 --> 00:43:43.840
minutes, so I'll got through my last points
pretty quickly and then we can have some time

00:43:43.840 --> 00:43:49.420
for discussion. So, the final point is if
you look at a lot of different studies, especially

00:43:49.420 --> 00:43:54.460
more survey oriented studies and you ask whether
the characteristics of a good boss, somebody's

00:43:54.460 --> 00:44:01.883
committed to, that who they work hard for
and is unlikely to quit or would want to work

00:44:01.883 --> 00:44:07.270
for again, things like that. One of the characteristics
that comes back over and over again is this

00:44:07.270 --> 00:44:14.130
notion that my boss has my back. My boss will
protect me. And so this notion is the best

00:44:14.130 --> 00:44:18.610
bosses protect their people from harm, all
sorts of idiocy. I can tell you a story I

00:44:18.610 --> 00:44:21.860
heard from Pixar just yesterday because it's
better than any of mine. I'll go through whatever

00:44:21.860 --> 00:44:28.520
ones I have. So, I, I gave this example and
there was one guy afterwards and he told me

00:44:28.520 --> 00:44:33.080
worked for Pixar 28 years. I didn't even realize
it was that old. So, so I guess you have a

00:44:33.080 --> 00:44:36.160
club at Pixar for people who have been there
for more than half their lives and he was

00:44:36.160 --> 00:44:42.660
the first member that, and he described how
when Pixar was part of Lucas Entertainment

00:44:42.660 --> 00:44:47.480
and some of you may know the story. It's a
pretty good story, which was that Pixar, which

00:44:47.480 --> 00:44:51.580
was still trying to make animated movies,
but being forced to do other things as well.

00:44:51.580 --> 00:44:56.000
It was part of the Lucas Empire, but then
Lucas had a messy divorce so Jobs bought it

00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:00.400
for a song; bought it for 10 million dollars
from George Lucas. But, before this happened,

00:45:00.400 --> 00:45:07.230
there was a bunch of financial problems and
Ed Catmull and then there's a guy named Alvy

00:45:07.230 --> 00:45:10.541
Ray Smith, and if you don't know Alvy Ray
Smith, it's like look at your Silicon Valley

00:45:10.541 --> 00:45:15.471
history; amazing guy at Xerox Park who was
the main person who invented the technology

00:45:15.471 --> 00:45:20.090
that made 3D animation possible and he actually
got fired by Xerox Park. In fact, he was never

00:45:20.090 --> 00:45:24.250
hired officially. He was a piece of equipment
that was rented; that's how they got him in

00:45:24.250 --> 00:45:29.100
through their accounting system. Anyhow, so
there was an efficiency guy who wanted to

00:45:29.100 --> 00:45:34.410
cut costs at Pixar, it, it. I heard this from
this guy, and there's a couple other folks

00:45:34.410 --> 00:45:40.260
who have been around a long time just yesterday
and they kept saying to, especially Ed Catmull

00:45:40.260 --> 00:45:44.110
to Alby Ray Smith, where's the list of people
we've gotta lay off? And they'd say, "Oh,

00:45:44.110 --> 00:45:46.930
we'll give it to you tomorrow. We'll give
it to you tomorrow.." So finally, they gave

00:45:46.930 --> 00:45:51.430
up and gave him the list and there were two
names on the list: Ed Catmull and Alby Ray

00:45:51.430 --> 00:45:52.430
Smith.

00:45:52.430 --> 00:45:53.430
[laughter]

00:45:53.430 --> 00:45:58.280
And that story, which they tell over and over
again at Pixar, that's a sign that those guys

00:45:58.280 --> 00:46:02.440
have their backs and, by the way, they didn't
do any layoffs and a little bit later, Jobs

00:46:02.440 --> 00:46:07.970
bought it for 10 million dollars. But to me,
that's a better story than any one I can tell

00:46:07.970 --> 00:46:14.261
you and so I'll just sort of like zip ahead.
Some about more minor ways that a good boss

00:46:14.261 --> 00:46:20.900
might do it, like by seeing visitors so you
can get your work done, making meetings short.

00:46:20.900 --> 00:46:24.971
My colleague, Jeff Pfeffer, who writes about
power and politics, will tell you if you want

00:46:24.971 --> 00:46:29.270
to get ahead and push people around and be
known as powerful, you might start meetings

00:46:29.270 --> 00:46:33.700
late; hold people a little bit later to show
that you're so important that whatever they're

00:46:33.700 --> 00:46:37.110
doing next isn't so important. But, if you
actually cared about their efficiency you

00:46:37.110 --> 00:46:42.480
might keep the meetings shorter and if you
will cancel, cancel them on time or end them

00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:47.270
on time when possible. And then the other
thing, and I'll tell this one quickly because

00:46:47.270 --> 00:46:54.620
I think it's fun, is, and I guess the Alby
Ray Smith and Ed Catmull falls in this, too,

00:46:54.620 --> 00:46:59.840
one of the things that good bosses do in any
large bureaucracy there ends up being some

00:46:59.840 --> 00:47:04.790
idiocy from on high and part of your job as
a boss is to protect your people from idiocy

00:47:04.790 --> 00:47:11.010
from on high. And my favorite example of this
was in, this was so long ago, like 1986. I

00:47:11.010 --> 00:47:15.950
just moved back from California, I did my
dissertation on organizational death in Michigan,

00:47:15.950 --> 00:47:21.200
the process in which organizations are unwound.
And I read that a large bank was closing 125

00:47:21.200 --> 00:47:26.340
branches and I contacted them immediately
because I thought I could do a quantitative

00:47:26.340 --> 00:47:30.910
study of the closing process and I met these
guys in San Francisco at the RAT Patrol, the

00:47:30.910 --> 00:47:35.380
Retail Action Team, who were overseeing the
process and what they did was to get to know

00:47:35.380 --> 00:47:41.230
me, they gave me four closings to study, four
that went well, in terms of business cap and

00:47:41.230 --> 00:47:46.070
four that went badly. And I did these little
case studies and the pattern was amazing.

00:47:46.070 --> 00:47:51.950
In the bad closings, the story was all the
same. They'd say the secret to our success

00:47:51.950 --> 00:47:56.750
was that we ignored the procedures from the
Retail Action Team. And I remember still in

00:47:56.750 --> 00:48:01.130
San Jose and a branch manager took out this
big, fat book that had been put together by

00:48:01.130 --> 00:48:05.430
the Retail Action Team, and he said, "The
secret to my success was I ignored everything

00:48:05.430 --> 00:48:06.430
in this book."

00:48:06.430 --> 00:48:07.430
[laughter]

00:48:07.430 --> 00:48:11.090
Then, I went to the bank closings and their
story was like the opposite. They said, "The

00:48:11.090 --> 00:48:15.000
reason we had so much trouble and we're so
frustrated is we tried to follow these procedures

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:18.970
and it wasn't possible." And then, for those
of you who are probably more experienced now

00:48:18.970 --> 00:48:23.230
than I was then, as you would predict, when
I pre-, when I presented these findings to

00:48:23.230 --> 00:48:28.330
the Retail Action Teams, I was shown the door
so quickly it was unbelievable and never heard

00:48:28.330 --> 00:48:33.290
from them again. So, that's the point of having
employees backs and let me make one more quick

00:48:33.290 --> 00:48:41.151
comment. And then hopefully have a few minutes
for questions and comments. This is a study

00:48:41.151 --> 00:48:45.740
that isn't particularly new, but I think is
still one of the most important ones I know.

00:48:45.740 --> 00:48:50.330
If you're going to be a boss and be in tune
with your people, maybe the most important

00:48:50.330 --> 00:48:57.530
single thing for you to think about and understand
is after the people you lead interact with

00:48:57.530 --> 00:49:04.110
you, they have more or less energy. And where
this little insight comes from, one of these

00:49:04.110 --> 00:49:08.740
incredibly simple studies, which actually
started out at McKinsey, there's a guy named

00:49:08.740 --> 00:49:12.170
Rob Cross who was working there when he did
it and now he's said it in 50 or 60 different

00:49:12.170 --> 00:49:16.520
firms. And what he keeps finding over and
over again is although he look at a bunch

00:49:16.520 --> 00:49:21.450
of different variables, and he's a social
network analyst, one of the main things that

00:49:21.450 --> 00:49:27.090
predict whether or not a manager, in particular,
gets a positive performance evaluation, gets

00:49:27.090 --> 00:49:32.540
promoted and in particular surrounded with
high, hard-working, high performing, innovative

00:49:32.540 --> 00:49:38.180
people is just the simple answer to that question.
After you talk to this person, do you have

00:49:38.180 --> 00:49:42.930
more or less energy? And, and I think the
important footnote here is this is not an

00:49:42.930 --> 00:49:47.330
argument for charisma, in fact, one of the
things that Rob really emphasizes is it's

00:49:47.330 --> 00:49:53.790
not about being charismatic or even emotionally
positive; it's more about having faith and

00:49:53.790 --> 00:49:59.610
trust from people than anything else. OK,
so, I, I've sort of made it on time with a

00:49:59.610 --> 00:50:05.060
little bit of rushing, so comments or questions
now that we're sort of at five to one? Reactions?

00:50:05.060 --> 00:50:10.730
&gt;&gt;audience member #2: So what about employees
that need to vent sometimes? People just need

00:50:10.730 --> 00:50:14.020
to vent because there's really frustrating
stuff and I at least wanna get it out. But,

00:50:14.020 --> 00:50:18.760
it has the potential of creating a, making
a negative environment that is taken wrong

00:50:18.760 --> 00:50:21.920
and is that something that, how does...

00:50:21.920 --> 00:50:26.990
&gt;&gt;Sutton: So, so that's an interesting question.
So, so, in general, and there's constant bitching

00:50:26.990 --> 00:50:32.540
that ends up being negative that comes along.
And this is about 15 years ago I did in ethnography

00:50:32.540 --> 00:50:37.380
at IDEO, and I, I heard this great statement
from this guy because I was like, "Why are

00:50:37.380 --> 00:50:40.910
you bitching?" He was actually bitching about
my friend and the founder, David Kelly. And

00:50:40.910 --> 00:50:44.080
I said, "Why are you bitching about David?
He's such a great guy." And he looks at me

00:50:44.080 --> 00:50:47.091
and he goes, "Oh, it isn't real complaining,
it's just recreational bitching."

00:50:47.091 --> 00:50:48.091
[laughter]

00:50:48.091 --> 00:50:54.550
And, and I think that's a pretty useful concept
because there's a difference between just

00:50:54.550 --> 00:50:58.680
little whining what we all do in life, versus
the stuff that's like real vindictiveness.

00:50:58.680 --> 00:51:04.590
The, the other thing that I would say that's
also important beyond that little recreational

00:51:04.590 --> 00:51:12.810
bitching point, is, is that, is that there,
that your bosses and other people in the organization

00:51:12.810 --> 00:51:18.990
need to be tolerant when you're actually pointing
out flaws. And, and there's a difference between

00:51:18.990 --> 00:51:22.960
whining and not being constructive and saying,
"That's wrong. You need to fix it or things

00:51:22.960 --> 00:51:27.170
are gonna be screwed up." And people who do
that are very important in organizations that

00:51:27.170 --> 00:51:32.010
don't treat such people with proper respects
have all sorts of problems. For example, when

00:51:32.010 --> 00:51:36.120
there are hospitals and they don't treat people
who do that with the right respect, they kill

00:51:36.120 --> 00:51:41.740
more people. So, so it's an important ability
as long as it's not just destructive whining

00:51:41.740 --> 00:51:47.040
that spreads like poison. But I, I think there's
a balance there. Yes. Hi!

00:51:47.040 --> 00:51:52.040
&gt;&gt;audience member #3: Hi. How can employees
help their bosses or their managers develop

00:51:52.040 --> 00:51:53.040
good habits?

00:51:53.040 --> 00:51:57.050
&gt;&gt;Sutton: Oh! Oh, I love that. So, it, well
first of all, I love that question because

00:51:57.050 --> 00:52:03.220
it's, it's not all of like the bosses responsibility.
It's partly your responsibility to people

00:52:03.220 --> 00:52:08.920
that you lead. How can they help them, their
habits? I guess the first thing that, that

00:52:08.920 --> 00:52:15.510
comes to me, that comes to mind is if I'm
managing my boss, is that I want to try to

00:52:15.510 --> 00:52:20.711
figure out where my bosses are emotionally
and I actually, you heard a great example.

00:52:20.711 --> 00:52:25.130
There's a friend of mine just took a job at
another university, he interviewed the Dean

00:52:25.130 --> 00:52:30.820
and he asked the Dean, he said, "I wanna know
all your personal quirks and I wanna know

00:52:30.820 --> 00:52:37.750
the things I can do to help you be more successful."
And then, and then, the other thing that I

00:52:37.750 --> 00:52:42.420
guess that I would say and I don't always
do this right is that I think it's important

00:52:42.420 --> 00:52:46.780
to figure when and where to criticize your
boss, so try to avoid embarrassing them in

00:52:46.780 --> 00:52:50.820
public. And hopefully, you have the kind of
boss that you can take aside and sort of beat

00:52:50.820 --> 00:52:56.370
up a little bit in private. But, I've, I think
that's a good topic, in fact, it's one of

00:52:56.370 --> 00:53:00.970
the things I've tried, I may even do the book
after next time. The question is like, how

00:53:00.970 --> 00:53:05.010
you help a manager, or manage your boss because
the boss can't do everything. They need help

00:53:05.010 --> 00:53:07.050
with what they're doing. So, that's a great
topic.

00:53:07.050 --> 00:53:08.050
[pause]

00:53:08.050 --> 00:53:16.250
&gt;&gt;Cliff: Do we have, is there any kind of
questions?

00:53:16.250 --> 00:53:19.910
Cool. With that being said, thank you Dr.
Sutton and thanks guys.

00:53:19.910 --> 00:53:22.780
&gt;&gt;Sutton: Thanks, Cliff! Thank you guys, you
guys are great. Thank you. Thank you.

00:53:22.780 --> 00:53:22.990
