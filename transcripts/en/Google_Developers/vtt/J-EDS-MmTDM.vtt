SUNIT UNAR: Hi, everybody.

00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:02.078
My name is Sunit.

00:00:02.078 --> 00:00:04.200
I'm looking after the
AdMob business development

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:04.950
here in EMEA.

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.276
And today, I have some pretty
interesting agenda for you,

00:00:08.276 --> 00:00:09.650
because today,
I'm going to share

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:12.490
with you three new product
launches in Google AdMob,

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:14.955
plus a new Business
Development kit that we just

00:00:14.955 --> 00:00:18.960
released for the
developer communities.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.344
So to start with,
first, I would like

00:00:21.344 --> 00:00:22.760
to share with you
this wheel again

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:24.910
that Thomas shared
with you in the morning

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:28.730
sessions-- and the
idea of this wheel

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.580
and to share it with
you guys, because we

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:32.288
have a bunch of
different Google products

00:00:32.288 --> 00:00:36.150
which is available for
the developer communities.

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:38.400
To give you an
idea about what you

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.950
can use at different stages
of your development cycle--

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:43.390
you build your
game, and then you

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:45.242
work for growing your audience.

00:00:45.242 --> 00:00:47.325
And then when you [INAUDIBLE]
your audience-- that

00:00:47.325 --> 00:00:49.880
is that the third part
is engaging your players.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:51.660
And then when you
engage your players,

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.159
you're going to think about how
to monetize your application

00:00:54.159 --> 00:00:54.710
or games.

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.110
That's why we have different
products in Google, which

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:59.570
is available for you guys--
Google AdMob publicly

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.770
for publishers and where
Google Wallet stands for.

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:05.980
So today, the focus will
be more on Google AdMob.

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:09.450
But as most of you
predicted, it's

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.310
much more than a
mobile ad network.

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.480
And I would like to tell you a
little bit about the history--

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.650
how Google AdMob evolved
after we acquired it in 2013.

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:20.770
So when we first
acquired Google AdMob,

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.650
we realized that there has been
a lot to do with the product.

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:26.460
We need to develop it further
to make it much more profitable

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.900
for the developer communities
and for the gamers.

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:34.780
So we let our strong
advertiser base

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.360
to meet with all the
AdMob publishers which

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.272
is all available in the AdMob.

00:01:40.272 --> 00:01:43.570
And then we built new
programs and new features

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:49.460
in the product, such as
advanced mediation features

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:50.980
and such as new ad formats.

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:54.380
And we tried to make this
product much more quality

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.420
for all the developer
communities.

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.200
And then when it
comes to 2014, we

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.220
are now much more
confident to say

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:04.350
that we are in a strong position
where we can make this product

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.700
to work cross-functional for
all the developers out there.

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.015
When I say a cross-functional,
I mean not only advertising,

00:02:11.015 --> 00:02:13.530
but also I mean in a
purchase, for example.

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.280
Today, one of our
new launches is

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.850
going to be about
this topic, and I'm

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:19.890
going to tell you
further how we made

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.250
Google AdMob a great
monetization tool for you guys

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.380
to boost your in-app
purchase revenue,

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.420
but not only your ad revenue.

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.460
Also, the second
announcement of today

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:34.730
is going to be the integration
of Google Analytics

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.370
together with
Google AdMob and how

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.600
it helps you to understand
your audience better

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.345
and to segment your
users accordingly

00:02:40.345 --> 00:02:43.540
and to take necessary actions.

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.066
When we look at monetization,
monetization is a huge topic.

00:02:46.066 --> 00:02:47.190
It's a conundrum, actually.

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.065
And when we look at it,
we need to understand

00:02:49.065 --> 00:02:52.330
what are the different ways
that is available in the market

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.830
today.

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:57.437
And as you know, freemium is
one of the dominating ways

00:02:57.437 --> 00:03:00.020
to monetize your application--
together with in-app purchases.

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:01.480
But we also have paid downloads.

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.820
It's still standing there
for just another option.

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:07.300
And also, we have
advertising solutions.

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.429
I'm sure most of
mobile ad networks

00:03:09.429 --> 00:03:11.220
out there are communicating
to you everyday

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:16.070
by sending email or calling you
to be able to work with you.

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:18.950
And when we have a look at
these different options,

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:21.200
we need to understand what's
the trend for the future.

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.630
We need to understand
where the industry's going.

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:26.220
So when we have a look
at the premium downloads

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.460
and the freemium downloads
in the market today,

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:31.080
we have seen a drastic increase
in the freemium downloads.

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.980
And when we forecast the future
and the growth of the freemium

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.440
downloads, it's going to
increase much more and more--

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:40.020
up to 95% with growth rate.

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:43.890
So we can see clearly see
that in-app purchase is

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:49.070
one of the dominant monetization
options for you guys,

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:50.670
for the developer communities.

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.926
And we need to understand
how in-app spending is

00:03:53.926 --> 00:03:55.800
in [INAUDIBLE] with our
future business model

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.870
and with our future
business plans.

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:01.730
So we need to see which
markets are strongest

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:04.780
for us to increase-- to boost
our net-purchase revenue

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:06.840
whereas which
markets we can focus

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.720
on some other monetization
models-- such as advertising

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.820
or such as carrier
billing, for example.

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:17.230
So when we have a look at
the major markets today,

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:21.490
globally, we can see that
Germany and UK is dominating

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:24.040
in terms of in-app purchase
ratio for all the users

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:28.910
whereas US and France is coming
a little bit from behind.

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:31.630
So when I say
today, we are going

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:35.690
to talk about how we turned
AdMob into a monetization

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:38.380
solution for you-- not
only for ads, but also

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:41.700
for in-app purchase-- we
also need to understand how

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:43.630
our users are
interacting with us

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:46.350
and what percentage of our
users are doing in-app purchases

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:47.380
from our games.

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:51.970
So when we have a look
at the general ratio

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:54.570
of our in-app purchase
users-- yesterday,

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:56.380
I was talking to one
of the developers

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:59.760
here from social
games, and my friend

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:03.580
was just telling me that
only 3.2% of their users

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:05.900
are doing in-app purchase
within their games.

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:08.940
So this is a question that
we need to all think about.

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:12.790
What's happening to
the rest of the 97%?

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:15.757
I appreciate all the cool
stuff, all the great games

00:05:15.757 --> 00:05:17.590
that you are building--
they're great games.

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:19.540
They're just growing
the ecosystem

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:21.000
just as we would like to do.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.200
But at the same time,
we need to think about

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:25.120
and we need to ask this
question ourselves.

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:28.230
Are we really taking and
grasping all the money

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:31.280
on the table which is out there
and which is ready for us?

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:34.460
So it's not about showing
ads to every unique user

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:38.140
that you have, but it's about
maximizing our yield management

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:42.540
and maximizing it in a way that
we combine our in-app purchase

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:46.420
revenue with the
advertising revenue.

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:50.150
So let's have a look at what
are the current technology

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:54.560
in Google AdMob that we allow
our developers to use today.

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:57.980
So when we have a look at the
typical life-cycle of a game

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:01.860
developer in the
ad-monetization cycle,

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:04.040
we see three
different categories.

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:08.980
First, a game developers starts
to monetize with an ad network.

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:12.080
And then secondly,
the developer starts

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.740
to think about mediating
in between different ad

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:17.350
networks-- third party
sales or companies.

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:19.410
And then the last--
maturity cycle

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:22.300
is when you think about
integrating direct sales

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:25.140
into our games and
integrating your direct sales

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:27.780
activities together
with third party sales

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:30.240
companies and other
ad networks out there.

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:33.900
So I will first start
to share with you what

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:36.286
AdMob is able to provide
in the first cycle,

00:06:36.286 --> 00:06:37.660
and then we are
going to continue

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:39.630
with the second
and then the last.

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:43.970
So if you ever search for
Google AdMob in the internet,

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:46.084
in the forums, or even
in the social media,

00:06:46.084 --> 00:06:47.500
you're going to
see that fill-rate

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:50.270
is one of the trending topics
for Google AdMob today.

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:53.020
It is because we have
such a strong advertiser

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:55.660
base in the [? AdVerse ?]
product inventory,

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:58.460
and our advertisers, all
these premium advertisers,

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:00.210
are all out there--
which is more than one

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:03.300
million mobile bidders
today-- is out there to bid

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:05.630
for your mobile applications,
to show their ads

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:07.870
within your games or
within your applications.

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:10.970
So this is why we have
such a strong position

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:13.550
today in the market,
where we have up to 99%

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:15.902
fill-rate in the market.

00:07:15.902 --> 00:07:19.390
And secondly, if you ever
search for Google AdMob again,

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:21.310
and the second trending
topic that you're

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:24.680
going to see-- especially after
the Flappy Birds example--

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:26.540
that people,
developers out there

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:30.170
are talking about the high
eCPMs of Google AdMob.

00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:32.540
And they look happy.

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:33.350
They are happy.

00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:35.870
We know they're happy,
because back in two years

00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:38.960
when we searched
for Google AdMob--

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:42.130
I remember two years ago, I
was reading a developer forum.

00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:43.620
And developers were
all complaining

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:46.510
about how eCPMs were
low in Google AdMob.

00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:47.550
And we got our lesson.

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:52.810
We worked on it, and we tried
to make our product first,

00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:54.690
much more profitable
for developers.

00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:58.310
And secondly, much more
quality for the developers.

00:07:58.310 --> 00:08:02.430
So what happened-- and our eCPMs
grew by 300% in the last year--

00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:07.390
is first of all, we launched new
products like CPM Floor Launch.

00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:10.760
And now secondly, we launched
the new product user interface

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:13.850
and the new AdMob
front-end user interface.

00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:17.310
And it came up with new product
features such as Ad Network

00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:18.180
Optimization.

00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:24.320
And then by mid 2013, we rolled
all interstitial ad formats

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:25.870
globally to all the developers.

00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:28.240
And lastly, we have seen
some seasonality factors

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:30.070
during the Christmas time.

00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:32.549
So let's have a look at what
are all the different ad

00:08:32.549 --> 00:08:36.100
formats available to make
this profit available for you,

00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:39.789
to make this 300% eCPM
growth available for you.

00:08:39.789 --> 00:08:41.900
First of all, we
have Smart Banners.

00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:46.480
So when the first mobile ad
networks started to evolve,

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:48.760
the very first ad format,
which has been used

00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:50.750
was the classical banners.

00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:52.510
But the problem with
the classical banners

00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:56.290
was they were not
able to orient and get

00:08:56.290 --> 00:08:58.220
with an orientation
of your device.

00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:00.510
So the image of a
classical banner

00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:03.890
was not optimized for
all the screen sizes.

00:09:03.890 --> 00:09:06.650
And that's where we launched
Smart Banners in Google AdMob

00:09:06.650 --> 00:09:07.860
in 2012.

00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:11.050
And smart banners
were able to orient

00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:13.930
with an orientation
of your screen,

00:09:13.930 --> 00:09:17.040
and we were able to deliver
the ads accordingly.

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:20.926
So this is a good example of a
Smart Banner in the Hill Climb

00:09:20.926 --> 00:09:24.250
Racing H from Fingersoft.

00:09:24.250 --> 00:09:28.000
And the second type of ad
formats we have available today

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.170
is full screen
interstitial ad formats.

00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:36.080
It was available until mid 2013
only to those beta testers.

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:40.140
But starting from mid 2013,
we rolled out these ad formats

00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:42.570
to all global
developer communities.

00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:47.380
And today, it's available for
all the developers out there.

00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:50.290
And the third
different ad format

00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:56.720
is video ad format, which is
the TrueView experience that you

00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:58.940
all have experienced in YouTube.

00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:00.600
We brought the
TrueView experience

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:03.430
into mobile applications, and we
launched the TrueView ad format

00:10:03.430 --> 00:10:05.210
into mobile applications.

00:10:05.210 --> 00:10:07.365
And just a piece of
note on this-- this

00:10:07.365 --> 00:10:12.070
is the first TrueView ad
format in a mobile application

00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:13.040
ecosystem.

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:17.120
And the reason why we would
like to see TrueView ad

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:20.440
formats into mobile applications
is because users are highly

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:22.130
engaging with this
type of ad formats.

00:10:22.130 --> 00:10:25.450
And by looking at their consent,
by looking at their will,

00:10:25.450 --> 00:10:26.940
we need to clearly
understand which

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:29.090
users would like to see
this type of ad formats

00:10:29.090 --> 00:10:32.490
whereas which users are
just skipping the ads

00:10:32.490 --> 00:10:34.770
and not showing it.

00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:39.350
So this is a good example of
how video ad experience looks

00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:40.550
like in your application.

00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:42.160
And in the first
screen, you're going

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:44.840
to see how the
gameplay looks like.

00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:47.290
And whenever the user
pauses the game or times

00:10:47.290 --> 00:10:50.290
out or during the
level intersection,

00:10:50.290 --> 00:10:52.880
we will give the
impression to the TrueView

00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:57.170
and the user either skips
the ad or just watches it.

00:10:57.170 --> 00:11:00.970
So what's new today is
in-app purchase ad formats.

00:11:00.970 --> 00:11:04.290
And I just shared with you that
one of the big announcements

00:11:04.290 --> 00:11:09.020
of today is we are announcing
the in-app purchase ad

00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:12.140
formats for the first time
for European app developers.

00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:16.800
And it was priorly announce
in [? GDSS ?] San Francisco

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:17.710
last week.

00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:19.840
So what's coming new
with in-app purchase

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:22.730
ad format is-- the
idea is we know

00:11:22.730 --> 00:11:25.426
that you want to increase your
in-app purchase revenue as

00:11:25.426 --> 00:11:27.300
well as you want to
increase your ad revenue.

00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:30.580
So how you can increase your
in-app purchase revenue?

00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:33.660
Just have a look at the
example that I shared with you

00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:34.840
from the social point.

00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:37.760
So social point is saying
only 3% of their users

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:39.130
are doing in-app purchase.

00:11:39.130 --> 00:11:42.510
So the ideal solution is to
increase this 3% up to 5%,

00:11:42.510 --> 00:11:44.170
up to 6%, or even 10%.

00:11:44.170 --> 00:11:45.290
And how do we do it?

00:11:45.290 --> 00:11:47.120
So the idea here
is first of all,

00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:48.970
we define our in-app
product catalog.

00:11:48.970 --> 00:11:52.260
We define what different
types of products we're

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:54.020
going to offer to our users.

00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:56.720
And then after we
define our product,

00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:59.190
we are going to create
a user list for us.

00:11:59.190 --> 00:12:01.180
We are going to create
a targeting list.

00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:05.350
To show these ads,
these products

00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:08.060
to the different users, we
need to target those users.

00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:11.710
Let's think we have
100,000 users who

00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:13.400
are playing our
games, and we want

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:16.550
to find those users in
between this 100,000 who

00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:21.090
played our game in the last 24
hours, who reached to level 10,

00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:22.450
and who got stuck there.

00:12:22.450 --> 00:12:24.940
So now, we have the risk
of losing those users

00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:26.680
if they don't keep
playing and if they

00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:28.250
don't reach the level 10.

00:12:28.250 --> 00:12:32.910
And we can target those users,
and we can show our in-app ad

00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:36.070
formats to those users by
looking at their 24 hours

00:12:36.070 --> 00:12:39.080
traffic, by looking
at their session,

00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:42.610
and by looking at different
dimensions, such as country,

00:12:42.610 --> 00:12:45.790
demography, and age,
and language here.

00:12:45.790 --> 00:12:50.190
So the idea here is not only
to show in-app purchase ads

00:12:50.190 --> 00:12:53.280
to your users, but also
to segment your users

00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:55.290
in a best way.

00:12:55.290 --> 00:12:56.910
When I say "segmenting
your users,"

00:12:56.910 --> 00:12:59.760
it's not only in-app purchase
versus non-in-app purchase.

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:02.240
It's also to understand
your users segmentation

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:05.960
with the AdMob filterings
available for in-app purchase

00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:06.460
ad formats.

00:13:09.710 --> 00:13:13.160
So the second
announcement of today

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:17.870
is we have been working on
integrating Google Analytics

00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:23.660
into AdMob and to allow this
product to the developer

00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:25.960
communities as a
unified product which

00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:29.440
should be used in
conjunction together.

00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:32.280
And the idea is we need to
understand our users in order

00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:35.680
to maximize our monetization
value from them.

00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:37.570
And when I say "we
need to maximize

00:13:37.570 --> 00:13:40.961
the value from each users,"
I would mean not only

00:13:40.961 --> 00:13:43.460
trying to understand if they're
purchasing any digital goods

00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:45.043
from our application,
but also I would

00:13:45.043 --> 00:13:48.470
like to say we need to
understand at which session

00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:52.570
our users are withdrawing
to play our games

00:13:52.570 --> 00:13:55.720
or at which session are
the users more integrating

00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:56.380
with our games.

00:13:56.380 --> 00:13:59.460
So the ideal solution is to
have much more engaged users

00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:01.640
at the end by having
all the analytics

00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:02.855
data in the same interface.

00:14:05.930 --> 00:14:08.400
This is in the
beta program still.

00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:12.109
And when you start using the
analytics integration together

00:14:12.109 --> 00:14:13.900
with Google AdMob--
this is the front-end--

00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:17.180
you will see you will
have another tab here

00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:18.410
which is saying Analyze.

00:14:18.410 --> 00:14:20.260
And from the
front-end, you will be

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:26.280
able to see different dimensions
of your users such as behavior,

00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:28.660
such as acquisition, such
as the number of users,

00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:30.670
such as the session, and
such as the real time

00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:37.410
value of our users also, as
well as the device breakdown.

00:14:37.410 --> 00:14:40.880
So what can Google Analytics
integration bring to us?

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:42.630
What's the additional
value of it?

00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:45.530
First of all, it's a
cross-platform product

00:14:45.530 --> 00:14:49.790
and it allows us to run
our monetization promotion

00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:53.810
and analyze campaigns at one
front-end user interface.

00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:55.320
So it's a single
product which can

00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:59.630
help us to analyze our users, to
promote our mobile applications

00:14:59.630 --> 00:15:02.580
or games, or to monetize
our games and applications.

00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:05.780
And as you can see, it's a
very clear and simplified user

00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:07.410
interface.

00:15:07.410 --> 00:15:10.750
So you integrated analytics.

00:15:10.750 --> 00:15:12.970
You started monetizing
your applications.

00:15:12.970 --> 00:15:15.740
You started showing ads
from different advertisers

00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:16.490
of Google.

00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:18.540
And the question,
is how am I going

00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:22.940
to control my mobile
application or my game?

00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:24.890
And how am I going
to see which ads

00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:26.940
am I showing up to my users?

00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:29.599
So we also worked on
our filtering options

00:15:29.599 --> 00:15:31.140
and we revamped the
filtering options

00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:32.560
available to Google AdMob.

00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:35.270
Now, we have four
different categories

00:15:35.270 --> 00:15:38.780
how to target our users and
how to show adds to our users.

00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:43.570
You can filter out specific
ads or specific companies

00:15:43.570 --> 00:15:47.220
by having your URL filter level,
by having application level,

00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:50.000
and also category/site filter
level, and text filter level.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.470
Let's say you're
a game developer

00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:53.220
and you're showing ads
in your application

00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:55.000
with Google AdMob
user interface,

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.930
and you wouldn't like to show
ads from other game companies--

00:15:57.930 --> 00:15:58.740
obviously.

00:15:58.740 --> 00:16:01.760
So you can do a category
level by filtering out gaming

00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:02.740
as a category.

00:16:02.740 --> 00:16:04.800
From that moment
on, you would not

00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:09.060
show any gaming
ads to your users.

00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:13.140
So now, we are at the second
stage of a typical game

00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:16.250
developer when he starts
monetizing with ads

00:16:16.250 --> 00:16:20.240
and where we need to have a
look at what are the other ad

00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:23.170
networks out there and what is
the solution from Google AdMob

00:16:23.170 --> 00:16:25.870
to mediate in between
different ad networks.

00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:31.180
So the last product launch today
is Ad Network Optimization,

00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:35.570
and Ad Network Optimization
has been launched a month ago.

00:16:35.570 --> 00:16:39.020
And the reason why we needed
such a tool, such a feature

00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:42.080
in Google AdMob is because
we understand the real value

00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:43.530
of all the ad
networks out there.

00:16:43.530 --> 00:16:47.090
Because we know that they are
not created equally naturally.

00:16:47.090 --> 00:16:49.850
And we need to understand what
is the value of Ad Network

00:16:49.850 --> 00:16:50.980
Optimization here.

00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:55.110
First of all, you will be able
to access to the real time CPM

00:16:55.110 --> 00:16:57.040
information or other
ad networks out there.

00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:59.420
So you can maximize
your yield management

00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:01.870
by looking at these real time
CPM values from different ad

00:17:01.870 --> 00:17:02.900
networks.

00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:06.359
And secondly, you can set up
an Impression Goal Campaign

00:17:06.359 --> 00:17:08.610
and limit the number of
impressions that you set up

00:17:08.610 --> 00:17:09.859
for your [INAUDIBLE] campaign.

00:17:09.859 --> 00:17:12.020
Let's say you want to
cross-promote your games,

00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:14.550
and you want to set up a
[INAUDIBLE] campaign in Google

00:17:14.550 --> 00:17:17.589
AdMob, and you want to limit
the number of impressions

00:17:17.589 --> 00:17:20.329
that you give to the users
per session or per user.

00:17:20.329 --> 00:17:22.210
So this is a feature
that will enable

00:17:22.210 --> 00:17:25.670
you to go in this direction.

00:17:25.670 --> 00:17:29.260
And we have another
solution which

00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:32.860
will facilitate your mediation
stack if you ever it set up

00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:35.010
in Google AdMob,
and it will allow

00:17:35.010 --> 00:17:38.529
you to maximize your
value or to maximize

00:17:38.529 --> 00:17:40.070
the value of each
impression that you

00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:42.050
get from these
different ad networks.

00:17:42.050 --> 00:17:44.480
Let's say you want to work
with two or three different ad

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:45.150
networks.

00:17:45.150 --> 00:17:47.470
And you can create-- you
can set up a mediation stake

00:17:47.470 --> 00:17:50.900
by saying I want to be Ad
Network X, Ad Network Y, and Ad

00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:51.830
Network Z.

00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:56.300
So AdMob eCPM Floor Beta feature
is providing you the ability

00:17:56.300 --> 00:17:59.750
to set up minimum eCPMs
for each ad network,

00:17:59.750 --> 00:18:03.660
and it will help you to maximize
the value of each ad impression

00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:06.720
that you can get from these
three different ad networks.

00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:09.200
So you can create your
mediation stack and do better

00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:11.235
targeting with AdMob
eCPM Floor Beta.

00:18:15.690 --> 00:18:19.130
And if you ever mediated between
different ad networks, what

00:18:19.130 --> 00:18:21.240
you are going to observe,
what you're going to see

00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:25.430
is your eCPMs is not going to
be stable, for obvious reasons.

00:18:25.430 --> 00:18:27.600
Let's say you implemented
a mobile ad network,

00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:29.130
and you test it
for a while and you

00:18:29.130 --> 00:18:32.360
have seen that you're eCPMs
are fluctuating widely.

00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:35.880
So the reality is that not all
ad network is created equally

00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:41.470
naturally, and every ad network
has had differently eCPM values

00:18:41.470 --> 00:18:46.670
by looking at different factors,
such as the advertiser demand,

00:18:46.670 --> 00:18:51.140
such as the seasonality, and
such as the local ad network

00:18:51.140 --> 00:18:51.900
factors.

00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:54.630
Because some ad networks
are locally, much more

00:18:54.630 --> 00:18:57.880
stronger than the other ad
networks in some local markets,

00:18:57.880 --> 00:19:00.460
and those ad networks are going
to bring you much value it

00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:04.570
in those markets where
they're standing strong for.

00:19:04.570 --> 00:19:08.260
So all you need to do is
to find the optimum value

00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:12.780
and to find the optimum
eCPM from each ad network

00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:16.590
so you can focus on it and you
set up your mediation stake

00:19:16.590 --> 00:19:19.670
by looking at these
optimum eCPM values.

00:19:19.670 --> 00:19:23.740
And now, we are at the last
stage, which is maturity,

00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:28.460
for a typical game developer
in ad-monetization life-cycle.

00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:31.040
So in the maturity
stage, a developer

00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:34.980
would like to understand
all possible values

00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:38.410
that he can benefit
from in the market-- not

00:19:38.410 --> 00:19:40.380
only all different ad
networks out there,

00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:43.310
but also the direct
sales activities.

00:19:43.310 --> 00:19:47.050
Let's say you have a game
and you have a strong user

00:19:47.050 --> 00:19:50.737
base in a local market,
and those advertisers

00:19:50.737 --> 00:19:52.320
in those local markets
are approaching

00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:55.040
you to show their ads in your
applications or in your games.

00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:57.580
And this is going to
be a great deal for you

00:19:57.580 --> 00:20:00.540
because they're offering
you a much better deal

00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:02.570
than any other ad
networks out there.

00:20:02.570 --> 00:20:06.480
So the need here is that the
developer communities out there

00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:09.880
needs a tool where they can
set up their direct sales

00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:12.060
additionally with all
the other ad networks,

00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:16.280
and they can set up their DFP
text onto their applications

00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:18.380
and games, and they can
manage all their yield

00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:19.980
management from that tool.

00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:21.880
So this is where,
as Google, we're

00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:23.900
offering DoubleClick
for publishers

00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:26.060
as a solution to the
developer communities

00:20:26.060 --> 00:20:28.210
where they can integrate
their direct sales

00:20:28.210 --> 00:20:31.020
activities with all their
ad network activities.

00:20:36.290 --> 00:20:38.900
And one of the
last announcements

00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:41.260
today is going to be the
App Developer Business

00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:44.350
Kit by the AdMob Marketing team.

00:20:44.350 --> 00:20:48.000
We first announced it in JDC
San Francisco last week as well.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.900
So if you ever visit
google.com/admob,

00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:54.560
you will find out a really
useful page which will gave you

00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:57.500
some ideas about the consumer
research in the key markets

00:20:57.500 --> 00:21:01.290
and such as the best practices
of all other ad networks,

00:21:01.290 --> 00:21:02.450
not only AdMob.

00:21:02.450 --> 00:21:05.820
Also, it will give you some
success stories and interviews

00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:08.120
with the successful
publishers and advertisers

00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:09.190
of Google AdMob.

00:21:09.190 --> 00:21:11.580
So I would strongly recommend
you to visit this page

00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:13.500
and have a look, and
it could give you

00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:15.560
an idea about how to
set up your business

00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:20.330
model around your
mobile apps and games.

00:21:20.330 --> 00:21:24.850
And AdMob, from now
on, is not going

00:21:24.850 --> 00:21:28.310
to be only a solution for
you guys as an ad network,

00:21:28.310 --> 00:21:31.140
but it's going to be
an ad server, an ad

00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:35.890
network, and an analytics tool
by the integration of Google

00:21:35.890 --> 00:21:36.560
Analytics.

00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:38.990
So by using AdMob, you
will be able to understand

00:21:38.990 --> 00:21:40.490
your audience with
Google Analytics.

00:21:40.490 --> 00:21:43.170
It could give you an idea
about how to segment your users

00:21:43.170 --> 00:21:45.480
and how to take necessary
actions upon it.

00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:47.550
And then you can
grow your revenue.

00:21:47.550 --> 00:21:52.840
You can grow your
in-app purchase revenue

00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:55.330
by showing ads to the right
people at the right time.

00:21:55.330 --> 00:21:57.800
And also, it will help you to
maximize your in-app purchase

00:21:57.800 --> 00:21:58.430
revenue.

00:21:58.430 --> 00:22:01.160
It will not only be an ad
network solution for you.

00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:04.180
So you can also maximize
the value of each user

00:22:04.180 --> 00:22:05.830
that you have today.

00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:08.650
And this is all
from my side today.

00:22:08.650 --> 00:22:11.960
And I will be open for another
five minutes to your questions,

00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:14.948
if you have any.

00:22:14.948 --> 00:22:18.434
[APPLAUSE]

00:22:26.407 --> 00:22:27.240
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:29.434
Do you charge for
cross-promotion?

00:22:29.434 --> 00:22:30.350
SUNIT UNAR: Pardon me?

00:22:30.350 --> 00:22:32.183
AUDIENCE: Do you charge
for cross-promotion?

00:22:32.183 --> 00:22:35.950
SUNIT UNAR: No, all the
cross-promotion products

00:22:35.950 --> 00:22:40.510
and in-app purchase ad formats
are free products for you.

00:22:40.510 --> 00:22:43.460
And no matter how
many impressions

00:22:43.460 --> 00:22:45.210
that you are targeting
for, it's going

00:22:45.210 --> 00:22:47.069
to be a free service
from Google AdMob.

00:22:47.069 --> 00:22:48.360
AUDIENCE: Wonderful, thank you.

00:22:52.350 --> 00:22:54.282
SUNIT UNAR: One question here.

00:22:54.282 --> 00:22:57.370
AUDIENCE: All right, I've
been seeing some problems--

00:22:57.370 --> 00:23:01.640
not with AdMob but with
one of your competitors.

00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:06.710
If we push several million
new users into the product,

00:23:06.710 --> 00:23:08.975
then the mediation
layer-- has it

00:23:08.975 --> 00:23:11.220
been able to keep
up with traffic?

00:23:11.220 --> 00:23:15.430
So the eCPM has
fluctuated crazily-- well,

00:23:15.430 --> 00:23:18.250
what we do apart from spread
out the new users over a longer

00:23:18.250 --> 00:23:21.610
period of time to give the
mediation layers time to react,

00:23:21.610 --> 00:23:22.884
build up the profiles?

00:23:22.884 --> 00:23:24.800
SUNIT UNAR: That's a
great question, actually.

00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:28.800
So when you set up
a mediation stack,

00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:31.680
you can specify
more than one rule.

00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:37.420
And this means that eCPMs are
not always the same-- globally.

00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:39.800
So let's say you set
up a mediation state.

00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:42.220
You want to show ads
first from Google AdMob,

00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:45.740
second, from Ad Network X,
and third, from Ad Network Y.

00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:47.320
And you set up these
rules, globally,

00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:49.800
but it means that AdMob
is not able to give you

00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:53.460
the same amount of eCPM from
all different markets out there.

00:23:53.460 --> 00:23:56.100
We can see that AdMob is
strong in certain markets--

00:23:56.100 --> 00:23:58.700
in those global or
strong markets such as US

00:23:58.700 --> 00:23:59.980
or such as north Europe.

00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:02.370
But whereas, we can see
some other ad network out

00:24:02.370 --> 00:24:05.990
there is going to bring you
much more revenue than AdMob

00:24:05.990 --> 00:24:06.680
could do.

00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:09.670
So what you could do is you
could segment your mediation

00:24:09.670 --> 00:24:12.370
stack by looking at the
different geographies where

00:24:12.370 --> 00:24:14.130
you can get most eCPMs.

00:24:14.130 --> 00:24:17.700
And you can create and you can
set up a different mediation

00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:20.430
stack by focusing
on the geographies

00:24:20.430 --> 00:24:24.625
and the strong eCPMs
from those geographies.

00:24:24.625 --> 00:24:25.166
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:24:29.660 --> 00:24:31.977
MALE SPEAKER: Any others?

00:24:31.977 --> 00:24:33.310
OK, thank you very much, Cuneyt.

00:24:33.310 --> 00:24:34.860
SUNIT UNAR: Thank you.
