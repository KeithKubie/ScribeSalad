00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.730
3 and 10 are like terms.

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:04.430
Both of them are constants.

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:06.650
They have no variables.

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:10.570
Note that constants like 3 and
10 can be considered like terms.

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.195
6x and 6y are not like terms.

00:00:14.195 --> 00:00:16.635
The variables that they
have are different.

00:00:16.635 --> 00:00:20.770
5x cubed and 7x cubed are like pairs.

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:22.750
They share the variable, x cubed.

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:27.338
Note that x is raised to
the 3rd power for both terms.

00:00:27.338 --> 00:00:31.730
8ab and 9ab are also like terms.

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.215
They both share both variables a and b.

00:00:34.215 --> 00:00:38.864
7a squared b and
7ab squared are not like terms.

00:00:38.864 --> 00:00:46.220
Even though they both have both a and b,
a and b are raised to different powers.

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.370
Here, a is raised to the 2nd power and
b is raised to the 1st power.

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.450
Here, a is raised to the 1st power and
b is raised to the 2nd power.

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:55.590
So, they're not like terms.
