00:00:00.773 --> 00:00:02.186
- [Voiceover] Let's talk about multiplying

00:00:02.186 --> 00:00:03.936
by 10, 100, and 1000.

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:06.940
There's some cool number patterns

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:08.647
that happen with each of these.

00:00:08.647 --> 00:00:11.875
So let's start here with
something like four times 10,

00:00:11.875 --> 00:00:15.036
one that maybe we're comfortable
with or already know.

00:00:15.036 --> 00:00:17.619
Four times 10 would be the same

00:00:18.945 --> 00:00:20.028
as four tens.

00:00:22.625 --> 00:00:23.458
Four tens.

00:00:25.481 --> 00:00:26.648
And four tens,

00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:32.477
one way we could represent
that is a 10 plus a second 10

00:00:32.477 --> 00:00:35.407
plus a third 10 plus a fourth 10.

00:00:35.407 --> 00:00:36.490
Or four tens.

00:00:38.554 --> 00:00:40.252
And now let's count that.

00:00:40.252 --> 00:00:41.651
10 plus 10 is 20,

00:00:41.651 --> 00:00:42.760
plus 10 is 30,

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.253
plus 10 is 40.

00:00:44.253 --> 00:00:45.503
So our solution

00:00:47.444 --> 00:00:49.861
is 40, or a four with a zero.

00:00:53.248 --> 00:00:56.681
And this is the pattern
that we've seen before.

00:00:56.681 --> 00:00:59.371
When we multiply four times 10,

00:00:59.371 --> 00:01:02.238
we keep our whole number of four

00:01:02.238 --> 00:01:06.071
and we add a zero to the
end for the times 10.

00:01:07.228 --> 00:01:09.623
So another example of
that might be something

00:01:09.623 --> 00:01:11.290
like eight times 10.

00:01:13.155 --> 00:01:17.072
Well, eight times 10 is
the same as eight tens.

00:01:18.011 --> 00:01:19.701
And this time let's just count them.

00:01:19.701 --> 00:01:20.726
If we count eight tens,

00:01:20.726 --> 00:01:23.059
it'll be 10, 20, 30, 40, 50,

00:01:24.144 --> 00:01:25.061
60, 70, 80.

00:01:26.677 --> 00:01:30.752
So when I counted eight
tens, the solution was 80,

00:01:30.752 --> 00:01:33.669
or an eight with a zero on the end.

00:01:35.678 --> 00:01:40.437
So times 10, when we multiply
a whole number times 10,

00:01:40.437 --> 00:01:44.789
the pattern is that we
end up adding a zero

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:47.372
to the end of our whole number.

00:01:48.472 --> 00:01:51.300
So let's take now what we
already know about tens

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.241
and let's apply it to hundreds.

00:01:53.241 --> 00:01:55.741
Something like, let's say, two

00:01:57.722 --> 00:01:58.555
times 100.

00:02:00.485 --> 00:02:02.740
There's a couple ways
we can think about this.

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.907
One way is to say that this
is the same as two hundreds.

00:02:09.333 --> 00:02:10.416
Two hundreds,

00:02:11.483 --> 00:02:13.983
which is 100 plus another 100.

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:17.966
There's quite literally two hundreds,

00:02:17.966 --> 00:02:19.966
which is a total of 200,

00:02:22.672 --> 00:02:25.422
or two with two zeros on the end.

00:02:26.268 --> 00:02:29.702
Now we have two zeros on the end.

00:02:29.702 --> 00:02:32.743
Or another way to think about this is two,

00:02:32.743 --> 00:02:35.676
two times 100, instead
of saying times 100,

00:02:35.676 --> 00:02:38.259
we could say times 10 times 10.

00:02:39.292 --> 00:02:42.542
Because 10 times 10 is the same as 100.

00:02:45.306 --> 00:02:49.473
And two times 10, we know as
a two with a zero on the end,

00:02:51.063 --> 00:02:52.202
which is 20,

00:02:52.202 --> 00:02:54.274
and 20 times 10

00:02:54.274 --> 00:02:57.524
then will be 20 with a zero on the end.

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:01.081
Because we multiplied by 10 twice,

00:03:01.081 --> 00:03:02.664
we added two zeros.

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:06.008
And multiplying by 100 is just that.

00:03:06.008 --> 00:03:06.971
It's exactly that.

00:03:06.971 --> 00:03:09.480
It's multiplying by 10 twice.

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.964
So, if times 10 adds one zero,

00:03:11.964 --> 00:03:16.047
then times 100, or times
10 twice, adds two zeros

00:03:17.103 --> 00:03:18.270
to our answer.

00:03:20.737 --> 00:03:23.950
And we can go even further
and think about thousands.

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.367
Let's try something like nine times 1000.

00:03:30.399 --> 00:03:33.621
Well, we could think of
this as nine thousands,

00:03:33.621 --> 00:03:36.505
and if we have nine thousands,

00:03:36.505 --> 00:03:40.005
then we have 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 5000,

00:03:41.222 --> 00:03:42.234
that was five,

00:03:42.234 --> 00:03:44.151
6000, 7000, 8000, 9000.

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:48.804
So when I counted to 1000 nine times,

00:03:48.804 --> 00:03:50.637
our solution was 9000.

00:03:52.251 --> 00:03:53.898
Or looking at the numbers,

00:03:53.898 --> 00:03:56.905
a nine, our original whole number,

00:03:56.905 --> 00:03:59.072
with three zeros after it.

00:04:00.399 --> 00:04:01.899
So nine times 1000

00:04:02.823 --> 00:04:05.656
is 9000, or nine with three zeros.

00:04:06.535 --> 00:04:08.488
And we can go back to what we did before.

00:04:08.488 --> 00:04:10.607
Thinking about this in terms of tens

00:04:10.607 --> 00:04:12.346
we've worked out,

00:04:12.346 --> 00:04:14.723
when multiplying by 10 adds a zero,

00:04:14.723 --> 00:04:18.644
so let's think about
1000 in terms of tens.

00:04:18.644 --> 00:04:19.727
1000 is equal

00:04:21.939 --> 00:04:23.939
to 10 times 10 times 10.

00:04:27.004 --> 00:04:28.587
10 times 10 is 100,

00:04:30.986 --> 00:04:32.736
and 100 tens is 1000.

00:04:35.273 --> 00:04:38.131
So instead of 1000, we can write

00:04:38.131 --> 00:04:40.210
10 times 10 times 10.

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:41.823
These are equivalent.

00:04:41.823 --> 00:04:44.472
And so, when we multiply
a number times 10,

00:04:44.472 --> 00:04:45.639
we add a zero.

00:04:46.692 --> 00:04:49.209
But here we're multiplying by three tens,

00:04:49.209 --> 00:04:51.042
so we add three zeros.

00:04:54.021 --> 00:04:57.252
So let's look at that all as one pattern.

00:04:57.252 --> 00:05:00.476
Let's take seven, the number seven,

00:05:00.476 --> 00:05:03.510
and let's multiply it by 10,

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:04.343
by 100,

00:05:05.993 --> 00:05:06.993
and by 1000,

00:05:08.727 --> 00:05:10.477
and see what happens.

00:05:11.499 --> 00:05:15.582
Seven times 10 is going
to be seven with one zero

00:05:16.712 --> 00:05:18.629
'cause we have one ten.

00:05:19.492 --> 00:05:23.142
Seven times 100 will
be seven with two zeros

00:05:23.142 --> 00:05:27.493
because, again, 100 is
the same as 10 times 10.

00:05:27.493 --> 00:05:30.365
So this is seven times 10 twice

00:05:30.365 --> 00:05:32.115
so we have two zeros.

00:05:33.242 --> 00:05:36.383
And seven times 1000 will be 7000,

00:05:36.383 --> 00:05:39.258
or seven with three zeros

00:05:39.258 --> 00:05:43.091
because 1000 is equal
to 10 times 10 times 10,

00:05:46.491 --> 00:05:47.658
or three tens.

00:05:48.499 --> 00:05:51.166
So we had one, two, three zeros.

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:54.988
And so, we can see the pattern here.

00:05:54.988 --> 00:05:58.879
When we multiply by
10, which has one zero,

00:05:58.879 --> 00:06:01.774
we add one zero to the
end of our whole number.

00:06:01.774 --> 00:06:04.731
When we multiply a whole number times 100,

00:06:04.731 --> 00:06:08.398
which has two zeros, we
add two zeros for hundreds.

00:06:08.398 --> 00:06:11.517
And for thousands, when
we multiply by 1000,

00:06:11.517 --> 00:06:15.684
we'll add three zeros to
the end of a whole number.
