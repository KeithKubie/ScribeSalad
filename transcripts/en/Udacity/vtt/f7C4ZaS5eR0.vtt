00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.648
Another way to think about rendering is as if we're looking through a screen

00:00:03.648 --> 00:00:07.804
door or a wire screen in a window. The screen is there to keep out flies but for

00:00:07.804 --> 00:00:12.348
my purposes each little square on the wire screen is like a pixel on a computer

00:00:12.348 --> 00:00:17.473
screen. Through some screen squares we see a bright red. Through others a deep

00:00:17.473 --> 00:00:22.151
green, and putting them all together we get a rose. When we look in our computer

00:00:22.151 --> 00:00:25.680
screen, we can think of it as a window into a 3D world. However, moving our head

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.104
in the real world, normally does not change what we see through this window. Our

00:00:29.104 --> 00:00:33.388
task in 3D computer graphics is to define a world, and then figure out as best

00:00:33.388 --> 00:00:37.143
we can what light comes from each direction and so forms an image.
