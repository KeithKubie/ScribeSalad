process looks like also questions about
implementation and code so we'll go

00:00:59.970 --> 00:00:59.980
implementation and code so we'll go
 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:01.200
implementation and code so we'll go
through that as well and Nick will give

like kiosk game consoles and so what we
 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:50.999
like kiosk game consoles and so what we
saw is a need to create new

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:51.009

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.290
exactly awesome awesome and so how does
how would one upgrade well we try to

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:28.300
how would one upgrade well we try to
 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:30.150
how would one upgrade well we try to
make it as simple as possible and we

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160
make it as simple as possible and we
 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.000
make it as simple as possible and we
boil it down into two easy steps the

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010
boil it down into two easy steps the
 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:34.530
boil it down into two easy steps the
first step is you actually have to

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540
first step is you actually have to
 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.420
first step is you actually have to
transfer processing from your classic

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430
transfer processing from your classic
 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.730
transfer processing from your classic
analytics to Universal analytics and

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:38.740
analytics to Universal analytics and
 

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:41.430
analytics to Universal analytics and
that's done through a tool the second

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440
that's done through a tool the second
 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.040
that's done through a tool the second
step is to actually retag or

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:44.050
step is to actually retag or
 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:46.740
step is to actually retag or
re-implement the tracking code to go

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750
re-implement the tracking code to go
 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.720
re-implement the tracking code to go
from the classic tracking library to the

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730
from the classic tracking library to the
 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:50.610
from the classic tracking library to the
new universal analytics library right

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620
new universal analytics library right
 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.980
new universal analytics library right
now the second step is optional but it's

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:52.990
now the second step is optional but it's
 

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:55.080
now the second step is optional but it's
highly recommended okay so you don't

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090
highly recommended okay so you don't
 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:56.760
highly recommended okay so you don't
have to change your code but we

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:56.770
have to change your code but we
 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:58.320
have to change your code but we
recommend that you don't have to change

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:58.330
recommend that you don't have to change
 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:00.750
recommend that you don't have to change
it but we recommend you do okay and

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760
it but we recommend you do okay and
 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:01.740
it but we recommend you do okay and
maybe we'll talk a little bit more about

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750
maybe we'll talk a little bit more about
 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:03.330
maybe we'll talk a little bit more about
that later when we talk more about your

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340
that later when we talk more about your
 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:06.180
that later when we talk more about your
implementation yeah cool now one other

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190
implementation yeah cool now one other
 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:07.560
implementation yeah cool now one other
thing that I wanted to ask you because

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:07.570
thing that I wanted to ask you because
 

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:08.790
thing that I wanted to ask you because
I've gotten a bunch of questions on this

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:08.800
I've gotten a bunch of questions on this
 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.830
I've gotten a bunch of questions on this
is there anybody who shouldn't be

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:10.840
is there anybody who shouldn't be
 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.450
is there anybody who shouldn't be
upgrading right now because a lot of

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:12.460
upgrading right now because a lot of
 

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:13.500
upgrading right now because a lot of
people watching this might have the

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:13.510
people watching this might have the
 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:15.240
people watching this might have the
question and should I upgrade or should

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250
question and should I upgrade or should
 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:16.950
question and should I upgrade or should
I wait there's there anything people

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:16.960
I wait there's there anything people
 

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:18.810
I wait there's there anything people
should know it's a good it's a great

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:18.820
should know it's a good it's a great
 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:22.110
should know it's a good it's a great
question so today there's many features

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120
question so today there's many features
 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.380
question so today there's many features
in Google Analytics the double-click

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:25.390
in Google Analytics the double-click
 

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:27.270
in Google Analytics the double-click
integration features the deal with

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280
integration features the deal with
 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:28.840
integration features the deal with
remarketing

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:28.850
remarketing
 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:31.810
remarketing
double-click for advertisers these

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:31.820
double-click for advertisers these
 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:33.670
double-click for advertisers these
features the the features that uses the

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680
features the the features that uses the
 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.490
features the the features that uses the
DCJS tracking code these features were

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:36.500
DCJS tracking code these features were
 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:38.110
DCJS tracking code these features were
still working on to support them in

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120
still working on to support them in
 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.240
still working on to support them in
Universal analytics ok so if you are

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:40.250
Universal analytics ok so if you are
 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:42.040
Universal analytics ok so if you are
using any of these features you should

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.050
using any of these features you should
 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:44.110
using any of these features you should
wait just a little bit longer so we have

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:44.120
wait just a little bit longer so we have
 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:45.879
wait just a little bit longer so we have
full support for all the features cool

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:45.889
full support for all the features cool
 

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:47.260
full support for all the features cool
so if you're using those you shouldn't

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:47.270
so if you're using those you shouldn't
 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:50.680
so if you're using those you shouldn't
use upgrade today the other set of users

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:50.690
use upgrade today the other set of users
 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:52.600
use upgrade today the other set of users
who shouldn't do this upgrade is if if

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:52.610
who shouldn't do this upgrade is if if
 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:54.310
who shouldn't do this upgrade is if if
you're not familiar with how you've

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:54.320
you're not familiar with how you've
 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.409
you're not familiar with how you've
implemented to the tracking code make

00:04:56.409 --> 00:04:56.419
implemented to the tracking code make
 

00:04:56.419 --> 00:04:57.909
implemented to the tracking code make
sure you go to somebody who is more

00:04:57.909 --> 00:04:57.919
sure you go to somebody who is more
 

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:00.189
sure you go to somebody who is more
familiar and make sure that there's no

00:05:00.189 --> 00:05:00.199
familiar and make sure that there's no
 

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:01.900
familiar and make sure that there's no
issues with your implementation that

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:01.910
issues with your implementation that
 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:03.700
issues with your implementation that
will break so you want to make sure you

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:03.710
will break so you want to make sure you
 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:05.500
will break so you want to make sure you
go through all of the you spend the time

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:05.510
go through all of the you spend the time
 

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:07.540
go through all of the you spend the time
learning about what this upgrade is and

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:07.550
learning about what this upgrade is and
 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:09.640
learning about what this upgrade is and
the implications it could have again you

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:09.650
the implications it could have again you
 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:11.080
the implications it could have again you
know there's many people using Google

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:11.090
know there's many people using Google
 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:13.330
know there's many people using Google
Analytics a lot of them get used it in

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:13.340
Analytics a lot of them get used it in
 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:15.189
Analytics a lot of them get used it in
very creative ways and so if you are

00:05:15.189 --> 00:05:15.199
very creative ways and so if you are
 

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:16.450
very creative ways and so if you are
using in a creative way you want to make

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:16.460
using in a creative way you want to make
 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:17.560
using in a creative way you want to make
sure that you know all the caveats

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:17.570
sure that you know all the caveats
 

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:19.810
sure that you know all the caveats
involved to make sure your up ladies as

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:19.820
involved to make sure your up ladies as
 

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:22.180
involved to make sure your up ladies as
seamless as possible and there's no risk

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:22.190
seamless as possible and there's no risk
 

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:24.730
seamless as possible and there's no risk
of data quality issues so for example if

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:24.740
of data quality issues so for example if
 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:25.570
of data quality issues so for example if
you did like a really custom

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:25.580
you did like a really custom
 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:27.850
you did like a really custom
implementation with gjs on your website

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:27.860
implementation with gjs on your website
 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:29.620
implementation with gjs on your website
correct you're definitely one of the

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:29.630
correct you're definitely one of the
 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:31.570
correct you're definitely one of the
people who we would suggest would spend

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:31.580
people who we would suggest would spend
 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:33.760
people who we would suggest would spend
a little bit more to uptime a time

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:33.770
a little bit more to uptime a time
 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:35.110
a little bit more to uptime a time
upfront to figure out if anything's

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:35.120
upfront to figure out if anything's
 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:36.730
upfront to figure out if anything's
going to break when you absolutely yeah

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:36.740
going to break when you absolutely yeah
 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:42.189
going to break when you absolutely yeah
cool cool so let's talk about the

00:05:42.189 --> 00:05:42.199
cool cool so let's talk about the
 

00:05:42.199 --> 00:05:43.659
cool cool so let's talk about the
upgrade tool did you mentioned there

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:43.669
upgrade tool did you mentioned there
 

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:44.680
upgrade tool did you mentioned there
were two steps right you're going to

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:44.690
were two steps right you're going to
 

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:46.420
were two steps right you're going to
transfer your property using a tool and

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:46.430
transfer your property using a tool and
 

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:48.430
transfer your property using a tool and
then you can optionally update the code

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:48.440
then you can optionally update the code
 

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:50.320
then you can optionally update the code
yeah so this would be step one using the

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:50.330
yeah so this would be step one using the
 

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:53.620
yeah so this would be step one using the
upgrade tool correct but what is the

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:53.630
upgrade tool correct but what is the
 

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:56.529
upgrade tool correct but what is the
upgrade tool what do you do right well

00:05:56.529 --> 00:05:56.539
upgrade tool what do you do right well
 

00:05:56.539 --> 00:05:58.839
upgrade tool what do you do right well
upgrade tool starts with that admin UI

00:05:58.839 --> 00:05:58.849
upgrade tool starts with that admin UI
 

00:05:58.849 --> 00:06:00.189
upgrade tool starts with that admin UI
in Google Analytics

00:06:00.189 --> 00:06:00.199
in Google Analytics
 

00:06:00.199 --> 00:06:01.600
in Google Analytics
ok I think I have a screenshot so let me

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:01.610
ok I think I have a screenshot so let me
 

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:03.070
ok I think I have a screenshot so let me
show it and then you can give us a yeah

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:03.080
show it and then you can give us a yeah
 

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:06.100
show it and then you can give us a yeah
fantastic so the upgrade tool allows you

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:06.110
fantastic so the upgrade tool allows you
 

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:09.010
fantastic so the upgrade tool allows you
to come in to the admin admin UI there's

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:09.020
to come in to the admin admin UI there's
 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:11.620
to come in to the admin admin UI there's
a new section for upgrading Universal

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:11.630
a new section for upgrading Universal
 

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:13.779
a new section for upgrading Universal
analytics upgrade under each property so

00:06:13.779 --> 00:06:13.789
analytics upgrade under each property so
 

00:06:13.789 --> 00:06:15.310
analytics upgrade under each property so
this happens at the property level so if

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:15.320
this happens at the property level so if
 

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:16.870
this happens at the property level so if
you look at a property column you'll see

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:16.880
you look at a property column you'll see
 

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:19.420
you look at a property column you'll see
a new tab for the upgrade when you click

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:19.430
a new tab for the upgrade when you click
 

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:21.520
a new tab for the upgrade when you click
on that you'll actually be able to go

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:21.530
on that you'll actually be able to go
 

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:24.850
on that you'll actually be able to go
and get to a page that take you through

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:24.860
and get to a page that take you through
 

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:26.830
and get to a page that take you through
a series of steps to transfer

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:26.840
a series of steps to transfer
 

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:28.089
a series of steps to transfer
prostituting from classic to Universal

00:06:28.089 --> 00:06:28.099
prostituting from classic to Universal
 

00:06:28.099 --> 00:06:31.029
prostituting from classic to Universal
analytics so what you do is you come

00:06:31.029 --> 00:06:31.039
analytics so what you do is you come
 

00:06:31.039 --> 00:06:33.879
analytics so what you do is you come
into the tool you you accept it you look

00:06:33.879 --> 00:06:33.889
into the tool you you accept it you look

sharing kind of all the little caveats

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:42.550
sharing kind of all the little caveats

you confirm we actually schedule your
property to be transferred now the the

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:50.830
property to be transferred now the the
 

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:52.920
property to be transferred now the the
transfer actually takes between 24 and

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:52.930
transfer actually takes between 24 and
 

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:56.219
transfer actually takes between 24 and
48 hours and so you can actually come

00:06:56.219 --> 00:06:56.229
48 hours and so you can actually come
 

00:06:56.229 --> 00:06:57.930
48 hours and so you can actually come
back you'll see a little state change

00:06:57.930 --> 00:06:57.940
back you'll see a little state change
 

00:06:57.940 --> 00:06:59.850
back you'll see a little state change
this says transfer in progress and

00:06:59.850 --> 00:06:59.860
this says transfer in progress and
 

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:01.439
this says transfer in progress and
actually under the tab for universal

00:07:01.439 --> 00:07:01.449
actually under the tab for universal
 

00:07:01.449 --> 00:07:02.460
actually under the tab for universal
analytics upgrade they'll say

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:02.470
analytics upgrade they'll say
 

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:03.839
analytics upgrade they'll say
transferred progress all right you can

00:07:03.839 --> 00:07:03.849
transferred progress all right you can
 

00:07:03.849 --> 00:07:05.640
transferred progress all right you can
always revisit to see where you are and

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:05.650
always revisit to see where you are and
 

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:08.249
always revisit to see where you are and
what stage you're at once we finally

00:07:08.249 --> 00:07:08.259
what stage you're at once we finally
 

00:07:08.259 --> 00:07:10.650
what stage you're at once we finally
transferred after that time then it'll

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:10.660
transferred after that time then it'll
 

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:12.029
transferred after that time then it'll
be saying transfer complete

00:07:12.029 --> 00:07:12.039
be saying transfer complete
 

00:07:12.039 --> 00:07:13.770
be saying transfer complete
and so that means once the transfer is

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:13.780
and so that means once the transfer is
 

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:16.110
and so that means once the transfer is
done you've completed step one of the

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:16.120
done you've completed step one of the
 

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:19.110
done you've completed step one of the
upgrade process okay so that's I click

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:19.120
upgrade process okay so that's I click
 

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:20.820
upgrade process okay so that's I click
the transfer button I'm gonna wait 24 to

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:20.830
the transfer button I'm gonna wait 24 to
 

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:23.100
the transfer button I'm gonna wait 24 to
48 hours check my account and it's gonna

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:23.110
48 hours check my account and it's gonna
 

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:24.450
48 hours check my account and it's gonna
give me a notice that says it's done

00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:24.460
give me a notice that says it's done
 

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:26.310
give me a notice that says it's done
right it's that easy that easy cool so

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:26.320
right it's that easy that easy cool so
 

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:27.899
right it's that easy that easy cool so
during that time can I still send data

00:07:27.899 --> 00:07:27.909
during that time can I still send data
 

00:07:27.909 --> 00:07:30.240
during that time can I still send data
you can continue to send data yeah but

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:30.250
you can continue to send data yeah but
 

00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:32.909
you can continue to send data yeah but
during the time you should not retag to

00:07:32.909 --> 00:07:32.919
during the time you should not retag to
 

00:07:32.919 --> 00:07:34.890
during the time you should not retag to
the new tracking code right do you need

00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:34.900
the new tracking code right do you need
 

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:36.659
the new tracking code right do you need
to make sure that you complete step 1

00:07:36.659 --> 00:07:36.669
to make sure that you complete step 1
 

00:07:36.669 --> 00:07:39.360
to make sure that you complete step 1
which is the transfer processing before

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:39.370
which is the transfer processing before
 

00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:41.010
which is the transfer processing before
you move to step 2 which is the actually

00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:41.020
you move to step 2 which is the actually
 

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:42.899
you move to step 2 which is the actually
reimplementation of tracking code

00:07:42.899 --> 00:07:42.909
reimplementation of tracking code
 

00:07:42.909 --> 00:07:45.270
reimplementation of tracking code
otherwise if you don't do that there

00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:45.280
otherwise if you don't do that there
 

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:47.310
otherwise if you don't do that there
could lead to data quality issues okay

00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:47.320
could lead to data quality issues okay
 

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:50.580
could lead to data quality issues okay
so transfer wait until we confirm it's

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:50.590
so transfer wait until we confirm it's
 

00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:51.839
so transfer wait until we confirm it's
been done in your account and then you

00:07:51.839 --> 00:07:51.849
been done in your account and then you
 

00:07:51.849 --> 00:07:52.980
been done in your account and then you
can change your code if you want to

00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:52.990
can change your code if you want to
 

00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:56.310
can change your code if you want to
exactly cool so I've gotten this

00:07:56.310 --> 00:07:56.320
exactly cool so I've gotten this
 

00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:57.719
exactly cool so I've gotten this
question from a number of users who

00:07:57.719 --> 00:07:57.729
question from a number of users who
 

00:07:57.729 --> 00:08:00.659
question from a number of users who
don't actually see the upgrade tool in

00:08:00.659 --> 00:08:00.669
don't actually see the upgrade tool in
 

00:08:00.669 --> 00:08:02.040
don't actually see the upgrade tool in
their account is there any reason why

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:02.050
their account is there any reason why
 

00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:03.839
their account is there any reason why
someone out there today would not see

00:08:03.839 --> 00:08:03.849
someone out there today would not see
 

00:08:03.849 --> 00:08:07.320
someone out there today would not see
the upgrade tool yeah how do they get to

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:07.330
the upgrade tool yeah how do they get to
 

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:08.490
the upgrade tool yeah how do they get to
see it so yes it's great

00:08:08.490 --> 00:08:08.500

if anybody's have enabled these features

00:08:32.069 --> 00:08:32.079
if anybody's have enabled these features
 

00:08:32.079 --> 00:08:35.069
if anybody's have enabled these features
we've explicitly not enabled this tool

00:08:35.069 --> 00:08:35.079
we've explicitly not enabled this tool

for any of the profiles within their
 

00:08:36.969 --> 00:08:38.880
for any of the profiles within their
account and the reason why is that we

account and the reason why is that we
 

00:08:38.890 --> 00:08:40.949

want to be extra careful because we

00:08:40.949 --> 00:08:40.959
want to be extra careful because we
 

00:08:40.959 --> 00:08:42.480
want to be extra careful because we
don't have full features support for

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:42.490
don't have full features support for
 

00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:43.860
don't have full features support for
these features in Universal analytics

we're still working on it
 

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:47.150
we're still working on it
like remarketing exact

00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:47.160
like remarketing exact
 

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:48.320
like remarketing exact
right because we don't have the full

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:48.330
right because we don't have the full
 

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:49.700
right because we don't have the full
feature support for that we don't want

00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:49.710
feature support for that we don't want
 

00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:51.920
feature support for that we don't want
to have somebody accidentally upgrade

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:51.930
to have somebody accidentally upgrade
 

00:08:51.930 --> 00:08:53.300

their account to something that they
 

00:08:53.310 --> 00:08:55.420
their account to something that they
can't use right okay so for those

00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:55.430
can't use right okay so for those
 

00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:57.770
can't use right okay so for those
properties if you don't see this today

00:08:57.770 --> 00:08:57.780
properties if you don't see this today
 

00:08:57.780 --> 00:09:00.080

don't worry we're just ensuring that

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:00.090
don't worry we're just ensuring that
 

00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:02.090
don't worry we're just ensuring that
there will be no issues when we actually

00:09:02.090 --> 00:09:02.100
there will be no issues when we actually
 

00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:04.340
there will be no issues when we actually
do enable it for them I don't got it and

00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:04.350
do enable it for them I don't got it and
 

00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:06.320
do enable it for them I don't got it and

on the universal analytics upgrade tab
great so now let's talk about step two

00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:31.590
great so now let's talk about step two
 

00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:33.230
great so now let's talk about step two
of the upgrade process which is actually

00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:33.240
of the upgrade process which is actually
 

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:36.290
of the upgrade process which is actually
updating your code so you mentioned that

00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:36.300
updating your code so you mentioned that
 

00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:37.520
updating your code so you mentioned that
updating the code is actually optional

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:37.530
updating the code is actually optional
 

00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:39.500
updating the code is actually optional
right step one transfer your property

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:39.510
right step one transfer your property
 

00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:42.160
right step one transfer your property
but step two is optional right why

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:42.170
but step two is optional right why
 

00:09:42.170 --> 00:09:44.300
but step two is optional right why
wouldn't you update your code or what do

00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:44.310
wouldn't you update your code or what do
 

00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:46.460
wouldn't you update your code or what do
you get from updating your code right so

00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:46.470
you get from updating your code right so
 

00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:48.950
you get from updating your code right so
that when in Universal analytics when we

00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:48.960
that when in Universal analytics when we
 

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:50.270
that when in Universal analytics when we
launch that we also announced a new

00:09:50.270 --> 00:09:50.280
launch that we also announced a new
 

00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:52.070
launch that we also announced a new
tracking code that works what universe

00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:52.080
tracking code that works what universe
 

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:54.710
tracking code that works what universe
analytics analytics jazz there's a lot

00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:54.720
analytics analytics jazz there's a lot
 

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:57.620
analytics analytics jazz there's a lot
for what yes and so the analytics yes

00:09:57.620 --> 00:09:57.630
for what yes and so the analytics yes
 

00:09:57.630 --> 00:10:00.980
for what yes and so the analytics yes
library is a lot more flexible for

00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:00.990
library is a lot more flexible for
 

00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:04.460
library is a lot more flexible for
developers so if you are customizing the

00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:04.470
developers so if you are customizing the
 

00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:07.370
developers so if you are customizing the
code it's a lot easier to customize and

00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:07.380
code it's a lot easier to customize and
 

00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:09.440
code it's a lot easier to customize and
there's a lot more functionality built

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:09.450
there's a lot more functionality built
 

00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:11.480
there's a lot more functionality built
to simplify the customization so

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:11.490
to simplify the customization so
 

00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:13.610
to simplify the customization so
customization is a big thing the second

00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:13.620
customization is a big thing the second
 

00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:16.250
customization is a big thing the second
part of it is for large websites for

00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:16.260
part of it is for large websites for
 

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:19.130
part of it is for large websites for
example with the new tracking code we

00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:19.140
example with the new tracking code we
 

00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:21.350
example with the new tracking code we
only use one cookie the old key tracking

00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:21.360
only use one cookie the old key tracking
 

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:22.940
only use one cookie the old key tracking
code we use five cookies mm-hm

00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:22.950
code we use five cookies mm-hm
 

00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:24.650
code we use five cookies mm-hm
so because cookies are sent with all the

00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:24.660
so because cookies are sent with all the
 

00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:25.820
so because cookies are sent with all the
different requests on the page you

00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:25.830
different requests on the page you
 

00:10:25.830 --> 00:10:28.100
different requests on the page you
actually can reduce a significant amount

00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:28.110
actually can reduce a significant amount
 

00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:30.470
actually can reduce a significant amount
of bandwidth for large sites as well and

00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:30.480
of bandwidth for large sites as well and
 

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:31.790
of bandwidth for large sites as well and
finally I think the most important

00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:31.800
finally I think the most important
 

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:33.950
finally I think the most important
reason is that all we have a bunch of

00:10:33.950 --> 00:10:33.960
reason is that all we have a bunch of
 

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:35.210
reason is that all we have a bunch of
new features we're working on with

00:10:35.210 --> 00:10:35.220
new features we're working on with
 

00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:36.230
new features we're working on with
Universal analytics

00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:36.240
Universal analytics
 

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:38.360
Universal analytics
we've announced some like user ID these

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:38.370
we've announced some like user ID these
 

00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:40.400
we've announced some like user ID these
type of features will only work with the

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:40.410
type of features will only work with the
 

00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:42.740
type of features will only work with the
new tracking code and increasingly we've

00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:42.750
new tracking code and increasingly we've
 

00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:45.110
new tracking code and increasingly we've
kind of have a team mandate that all new

00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:45.120
kind of have a team mandate that all new
 

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:47.120
kind of have a team mandate that all new
features are built only using Universal

00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:47.130
features are built only using Universal
 

00:10:47.130 --> 00:10:49.790
features are built only using Universal
analytics so increasingly we can't talk

00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:49.800
analytics so increasingly we can't talk
 

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:51.320
analytics so increasingly we can't talk
about them here but we are working on

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:51.330
about them here but we are working on
 

00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:52.910
about them here but we are working on
many new features that will only be

00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:52.920
many new features that will only be
 

00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:54.590
many new features that will only be
supported by what we're by the new

00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:54.600
supported by what we're by the new
 

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:56.630
supported by what we're by the new
analytics j/s tracking library so if you

00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:56.640
analytics j/s tracking library so if you
 

00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:58.340

right so what can you give us like just

00:11:04.249 --> 00:11:04.259
right so what can you give us like just
 

00:11:04.259 --> 00:11:05.569
right so what can you give us like just
an overview of the changes that you

00:11:05.569 --> 00:11:05.579
an overview of the changes that you
 

00:11:05.579 --> 00:11:07.879
an overview of the changes that you
would need to make as a developer if you

00:11:07.879 --> 00:11:07.889
would need to make as a developer if you
 

00:11:07.889 --> 00:11:09.769
would need to make as a developer if you
kind of had a simple site and a simple

00:11:09.769 --> 00:11:09.779
kind of had a simple site and a simple
 

00:11:09.779 --> 00:11:11.329
kind of had a simple site and a simple
implementation of GHA s what would you

00:11:11.329 --> 00:11:11.339
implementation of GHA s what would you
 

00:11:11.339 --> 00:11:13.009
implementation of GHA s what would you
need to do to get to analytics.js well

00:11:13.009 --> 00:11:13.019
need to do to get to analytics.js well

Analytics on a website is to put a piece

00:11:17.359 --> 00:11:17.369
Analytics on a website is to put a piece
 

00:11:17.369 --> 00:11:19.309
Analytics on a website is to put a piece

of JavaScript on all the pages of your
 

00:11:19.319 --> 00:11:21.980
of JavaScript on all the pages of your

changed with analytics yes so at minimum

00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:24.990
changed with analytics yes so at minimum
 

00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:26.269
changed with analytics yes so at minimum
you'd have to go through all the

00:11:26.269 --> 00:11:26.279
you'd have to go through all the
 

00:11:26.279 --> 00:11:27.609
you'd have to go through all the
different pages of your site and

00:11:27.609 --> 00:11:27.619
different pages of your site and
 

00:11:27.619 --> 00:11:30.350
different pages of your site and
implement the new tracking code replace

00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:30.360
implement the new tracking code replace
 

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:32.869
implement the new tracking code replace
the old one with the new now for people

00:11:32.869 --> 00:11:32.879
the old one with the new now for people
 

00:11:32.879 --> 00:11:33.850
the old one with the new now for people
who were doing more sophisticated

00:11:33.850 --> 00:11:33.860
who were doing more sophisticated
 

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:35.840
who were doing more sophisticated
integrations they have event tracking

00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:35.850
integrations they have event tracking
 

00:11:35.850 --> 00:11:39.319
integrations they have event tracking
social interactions ecommerce the actual

00:11:39.319 --> 00:11:39.329

tracking interface the actual methods

00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:41.970
tracking interface the actual methods
 

00:11:41.970 --> 00:11:43.609
tracking interface the actual methods
that you use on the tracking code have

00:11:43.609 --> 00:11:43.619
that you use on the tracking code have
 

00:11:43.619 --> 00:11:45.739
that you use on the tracking code have
changed so what you'll need to do is

00:11:45.739 --> 00:11:45.749
changed so what you'll need to do is
 

00:11:45.749 --> 00:11:47.600
changed so what you'll need to do is
update all the places where you're

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:47.610
update all the places where you're
 

00:11:47.610 --> 00:11:49.989
update all the places where you're
calling the old library with the new

00:11:49.989 --> 00:11:49.999
calling the old library with the new
 

00:11:49.999 --> 00:11:52.639
calling the old library with the new
methods that are corresponding to the

00:11:52.639 --> 00:11:52.649
methods that are corresponding to the
 

00:11:52.649 --> 00:11:53.989
methods that are corresponding to the
new library got it got it

00:11:53.989 --> 00:11:53.999
new library got it got it
 

00:11:53.999 --> 00:11:56.329
new library got it got it
duuude so for some people with big sites

00:11:56.329 --> 00:11:56.339
duuude so for some people with big sites
 

00:11:56.339 --> 00:11:58.460
duuude so for some people with big sites
this is actually a pretty sizable amount

00:11:58.460 --> 00:11:58.470
this is actually a pretty sizable amount
 

00:11:58.470 --> 00:12:00.259
this is actually a pretty sizable amount
of work right yeah do they need to

00:12:00.259 --> 00:12:00.269
of work right yeah do they need to
 

00:12:00.269 --> 00:12:02.359
of work right yeah do they need to
update everything all at once I mean

00:12:02.359 --> 00:12:02.369
update everything all at once I mean
 

00:12:02.369 --> 00:12:04.100
update everything all at once I mean
could you have on a page

00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:04.110
could you have on a page
 

00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:06.769
could you have on a page
some old ghis code and some new

00:12:06.769 --> 00:12:06.779
some old ghis code and some new
 

00:12:06.779 --> 00:12:08.960
some old ghis code and some new
analytics jas code well it's a great

00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:08.970
analytics jas code well it's a great
 

00:12:08.970 --> 00:12:11.119
analytics jas code well it's a great
question and so we've designed these

00:12:11.119 --> 00:12:11.129
question and so we've designed these
 

00:12:11.129 --> 00:12:12.559
question and so we've designed these
libraries to work together but there are

00:12:12.559 --> 00:12:12.569
libraries to work together but there are
 

00:12:12.569 --> 00:12:15.410
libraries to work together but there are
some caveats so for a given page the

00:12:15.410 --> 00:12:15.420
some caveats so for a given page the
 

00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:18.559
some caveats so for a given page the
tracking works at a property ID or a

00:12:18.559 --> 00:12:18.569
tracking works at a property ID or a
 

00:12:18.569 --> 00:12:20.840
tracking works at a property ID or a
property ID so this this you a number

00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:20.850
property ID so this this you a number
 

00:12:20.850 --> 00:12:24.379
property ID so this this you a number
you a xxx - why and so for one of those

00:12:24.379 --> 00:12:24.389
you a xxx - why and so for one of those
 

00:12:24.389 --> 00:12:27.379
you a xxx - why and so for one of those
properties you can only use one tracking

00:12:27.379 --> 00:12:27.389
properties you can only use one tracking
 

00:12:27.389 --> 00:12:30.199
properties you can only use one tracking
mechanism on a given page so either

00:12:30.199 --> 00:12:30.209
mechanism on a given page so either
 

00:12:30.209 --> 00:12:34.160
mechanism on a given page so either
using analytics chess or ghs for a given

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:34.170
using analytics chess or ghs for a given
 

00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:37.309
using analytics chess or ghs for a given
page now across different pages you we

00:12:37.309 --> 00:12:37.319
page now across different pages you we
 

00:12:37.319 --> 00:12:38.600
page now across different pages you we
have made these libraries work together

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:38.610
have made these libraries work together
 

00:12:38.610 --> 00:12:41.449
have made these libraries work together
so you can have the old tracking jgs

00:12:41.449 --> 00:12:41.459
so you can have the old tracking jgs
 

00:12:41.459 --> 00:12:44.780
so you can have the old tracking jgs
code on 50% of pages for one property

00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:44.790
code on 50% of pages for one property
 

00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:46.759
code on 50% of pages for one property
okay and for the other 50% you could

00:12:46.759 --> 00:12:46.769
okay and for the other 50% you could
 

00:12:46.769 --> 00:12:48.859
okay and for the other 50% you could
have the new one analytics chess or the

00:12:48.859 --> 00:12:48.869
have the new one analytics chess or the
 

00:12:48.869 --> 00:12:50.600
have the new one analytics chess or the
same property okay so the problem that

00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:50.610
same property okay so the problem that
 

00:12:50.610 --> 00:12:52.309
same property okay so the problem that
really arises when you actually for the

00:12:52.309 --> 00:12:52.319
really arises when you actually for the
 

00:12:52.319 --> 00:12:54.530
really arises when you actually for the
same property on the same page use

00:12:54.530 --> 00:12:54.540
same property on the same page use
 

00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:56.629
same property on the same page use
different libraries so for those people

00:12:56.629 --> 00:12:56.639
different libraries so for those people
 

00:12:56.639 --> 00:13:00.079
different libraries so for those people
who are planning on retaliating

00:13:00.079 --> 00:13:00.089
 

00:13:00.089 --> 00:13:03.710
I'm gonna retag 25% of my pages we can't

00:13:03.710 --> 00:13:03.720
I'm gonna retag 25% of my pages we can't
 

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:05.780
I'm gonna retag 25% of my pages we can't

the rest is ghs

00:13:12.999 --> 00:13:13.009
the rest is ghs
 

00:13:13.009 --> 00:13:14.829
the rest is ghs
right exactly yeah okay and that's for a

00:13:14.829 --> 00:13:14.839
right exactly yeah okay and that's for a
 

00:13:14.839 --> 00:13:16.689
right exactly yeah okay and that's for a
given property now of course there's

00:13:16.689 --> 00:13:16.699
given property now of course there's
 

00:13:16.699 --> 00:13:18.489
given property now of course there's
always the sophisticated users right

00:13:18.489 --> 00:13:18.499
always the sophisticated users right
 

00:13:18.499 --> 00:13:20.290
always the sophisticated users right
we're using multiple properties on the

00:13:20.290 --> 00:13:20.300
we're using multiple properties on the
 

00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:22.960
we're using multiple properties on the
same page right for roll-up reporting or

00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:22.970
same page right for roll-up reporting or
 

00:13:22.970 --> 00:13:24.639
same page right for roll-up reporting or
something like this so if you have

00:13:24.639 --> 00:13:24.649
something like this so if you have
 

00:13:24.649 --> 00:13:26.439
something like this so if you have
multiple properties on the same page you

00:13:26.439 --> 00:13:26.449
multiple properties on the same page you
 

00:13:26.449 --> 00:13:28.929
multiple properties on the same page you
can use GHS for one of the properties

00:13:28.929 --> 00:13:28.939
can use GHS for one of the properties
 

00:13:28.939 --> 00:13:31.449
can use GHS for one of the properties
and analytics.js for the other property

00:13:31.449 --> 00:13:31.459
and analytics.js for the other property
 

00:13:31.459 --> 00:13:33.730
and analytics.js for the other property
the problem arises when it's the same

00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:33.740
the problem arises when it's the same
 

00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:36.189
the problem arises when it's the same
property on the same page with two

00:13:36.189 --> 00:13:36.199
property on the same page with two
 

00:13:36.199 --> 00:13:38.169
property on the same page with two
different tracking guys I got it is

00:13:38.169 --> 00:13:38.179
different tracking guys I got it is
 

00:13:38.179 --> 00:13:40.809
different tracking guys I got it is
there any reason to dual tag at this

00:13:40.809 --> 00:13:40.819
there any reason to dual tag at this
 

00:13:40.819 --> 00:13:43.090
there any reason to dual tag at this
point we have the upgrade tool so is

00:13:43.090 --> 00:13:43.100
point we have the upgrade tool so is
 

00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:44.049
point we have the upgrade tool so is
there any reason that you would want a

00:13:44.049 --> 00:13:44.059
there any reason that you would want a
 

00:13:44.059 --> 00:13:46.869
there any reason that you would want a
dual tag your site completely with the

00:13:46.869 --> 00:13:46.879
dual tag your site completely with the
 

00:13:46.879 --> 00:13:48.699
dual tag your site completely with the
old code and the new code or is it just

00:13:48.699 --> 00:13:48.709
old code and the new code or is it just
 

00:13:48.709 --> 00:13:50.650
old code and the new code or is it just
time to switch over completely so dual

00:13:50.650 --> 00:13:50.660
time to switch over completely so dual
 

00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:52.419
time to switch over completely so dual
tagging what a lot of people do is

00:13:52.419 --> 00:13:52.429
tagging what a lot of people do is
 

00:13:52.429 --> 00:13:54.549
tagging what a lot of people do is
they'll have the old legacy GHS across

00:13:54.549 --> 00:13:54.559
they'll have the old legacy GHS across
 

00:13:54.559 --> 00:13:56.350
they'll have the old legacy GHS across
their site and then they'll create a new

00:13:56.350 --> 00:13:56.360
their site and then they'll create a new
 

00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:58.689
their site and then they'll create a new
universal analytics property and then

00:13:58.689 --> 00:13:58.699
universal analytics property and then
 

00:13:58.699 --> 00:14:00.429
universal analytics property and then
they'll implement analytics.js with the

00:14:00.429 --> 00:14:00.439
they'll implement analytics.js with the
 

00:14:00.439 --> 00:14:02.019
they'll implement analytics.js with the
new one across their site so your

00:14:02.019 --> 00:14:02.029
new one across their site so your
 

00:14:02.029 --> 00:14:03.819
new one across their site so your
tagging with two properties because we

00:14:03.819 --> 00:14:03.829
tagging with two properties because we
 

00:14:03.829 --> 00:14:05.199
tagging with two properties because we
didn't have this upgrade to in the past

00:14:05.199 --> 00:14:05.209
didn't have this upgrade to in the past
 

00:14:05.209 --> 00:14:07.210
didn't have this upgrade to in the past
right now when people compare the data

00:14:07.210 --> 00:14:07.220
right now when people compare the data
 

00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:08.980
right now when people compare the data
between the two they're always going to

00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:08.990
between the two they're always going to
 

00:14:08.990 --> 00:14:10.989
between the two they're always going to
see a difference because the actual

00:14:10.989 --> 00:14:10.999
see a difference because the actual
 

00:14:10.999 --> 00:14:13.869
see a difference because the actual
sequence of when the actual requests are

00:14:13.869 --> 00:14:13.879
sequence of when the actual requests are
 

00:14:13.879 --> 00:14:15.400
sequence of when the actual requests are
sent the hits are sent to Google

00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:15.410
sent the hits are sent to Google
 

00:14:15.410 --> 00:14:17.590
sent the hits are sent to Google
Analytics differ so we'll always never

00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:17.600
Analytics differ so we'll always never
 

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:19.960
Analytics differ so we'll always never
you know see a difference so what we

00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:19.970
you know see a difference so what we
 

00:14:19.970 --> 00:14:21.699
you know see a difference so what we
recommend for all users now we have the

00:14:21.699 --> 00:14:21.709
recommend for all users now we have the
 

00:14:21.709 --> 00:14:23.590
recommend for all users now we have the
upgrade is to actually go through the

00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:23.600
upgrade is to actually go through the
 

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:25.389
upgrade is to actually go through the
upgrade don't dual tag don't create a

00:14:25.389 --> 00:14:25.399
upgrade don't dual tag don't create a
 

00:14:25.399 --> 00:14:27.429
upgrade don't dual tag don't create a
new universal analytics property rather

00:14:27.429 --> 00:14:27.439
new universal analytics property rather
 

00:14:27.439 --> 00:14:30.009
new universal analytics property rather
convert your existing one to Universal

00:14:30.009 --> 00:14:30.019
convert your existing one to Universal
 

00:14:30.019 --> 00:14:32.019
convert your existing one to Universal
analytics and that ensures that the data

00:14:32.019 --> 00:14:32.029
analytics and that ensures that the data
 

00:14:32.029 --> 00:14:33.939
analytics and that ensures that the data
is most consistent you have the

00:14:33.939 --> 00:14:33.949
is most consistent you have the
 

00:14:33.949 --> 00:14:36.069
is most consistent you have the
historical data and make sure that you

00:14:36.069 --> 00:14:36.079
historical data and make sure that you
 

00:14:36.079 --> 00:14:38.619
historical data and make sure that you
don't have these kind of deltas between

00:14:38.619 --> 00:14:38.629
don't have these kind of deltas between
 

00:14:38.629 --> 00:14:40.179
don't have these kind of deltas between
the two tracking codes because they're

00:14:40.179 --> 00:14:40.189
the two tracking codes because they're
 

00:14:40.189 --> 00:14:41.470
the two tracking codes because they're
firing at a different rate in the

00:14:41.470 --> 00:14:41.480
firing at a different rate in the
 

00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:42.850
firing at a different rate in the
browser right right okay that makes

00:14:42.850 --> 00:14:42.860
browser right right okay that makes
 

00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:45.309
browser right right okay that makes
sense what happens for you so for those

00:14:45.309 --> 00:14:45.319
sense what happens for you so for those
 

00:14:45.319 --> 00:14:46.869
sense what happens for you so for those
people who are gonna put this off which

00:14:46.869 --> 00:14:46.879
people who are gonna put this off which
 

00:14:46.879 --> 00:14:48.519
people who are gonna put this off which
I don't hold it against them right right

00:14:48.519 --> 00:14:48.529
I don't hold it against them right right
 

00:14:48.529 --> 00:14:50.230
I don't hold it against them right right
putting it off what happens if they do

00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:50.240
putting it off what happens if they do
 

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:52.239
putting it off what happens if they do
nothing right now so you have gaj s on

00:14:52.239 --> 00:14:52.249
nothing right now so you have gaj s on
 

00:14:52.249 --> 00:14:55.289
nothing right now so you have gaj s on
your website it's been working fine

00:14:55.289 --> 00:14:55.299
your website it's been working fine
 

00:14:55.299 --> 00:14:57.220
your website it's been working fine
let's say you transfer your property

00:14:57.220 --> 00:14:57.230
let's say you transfer your property
 

00:14:57.230 --> 00:14:59.499
let's say you transfer your property
over but you don't actually upgrade your

00:14:59.499 --> 00:14:59.509
over but you don't actually upgrade your
 

00:14:59.509 --> 00:15:01.600
over but you don't actually upgrade your
code right what what happens then so

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:01.610
code right what what happens then so
 

00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:03.400
code right what what happens then so
once you've transferred to Universal

00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:03.410
once you've transferred to Universal
 

00:15:03.410 --> 00:15:05.350
once you've transferred to Universal
analytics you can still send the data

00:15:05.350 --> 00:15:05.360
analytics you can still send the data
 

00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:07.419
analytics you can still send the data
from the old tracking library that will

00:15:07.419 --> 00:15:07.429
from the old tracking library that will
 

00:15:07.429 --> 00:15:09.850
from the old tracking library that will
continue to work over time you'll see

00:15:09.850 --> 00:15:09.860
continue to work over time you'll see
 

00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:11.499
continue to work over time you'll see
that more features are added to the

00:15:11.499 --> 00:15:11.509
that more features are added to the
 

00:15:11.509 --> 00:15:13.150
that more features are added to the
analytics J's library so you want to get

00:15:13.150 --> 00:15:13.160
analytics J's library so you want to get
 

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:14.859
analytics J's library so you want to get
to take advantage of them but will still

00:15:14.859 --> 00:15:14.869
to take advantage of them but will still
 

00:15:14.869 --> 00:15:16.509
to take advantage of them but will still
collect the old data and process that

00:15:16.509 --> 00:15:16.519
collect the old data and process that
 

00:15:16.519 --> 00:15:18.489
collect the old data and process that
okay and and we can look a little bit

00:15:18.489 --> 00:15:18.499
okay and and we can look a little bit
 

00:15:18.499 --> 00:15:20.919
okay and and we can look a little bit
into the timeline kind of talk about

00:15:20.919 --> 00:15:20.929
into the timeline kind of talk about
 

00:15:20.929 --> 00:15:22.660
into the timeline kind of talk about
like how this will work out in the long

00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:22.670
like how this will work out in the long
 

00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:25.809
like how this will work out in the long
term okay cool let's move so we just

00:15:25.809 --> 00:15:25.819
term okay cool let's move so we just
 

00:15:25.819 --> 00:15:26.530
term okay cool let's move so we just
talked about web

00:15:26.530 --> 00:15:26.540
talked about web
 

00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:29.290
talked about web
and code and implementation issues there

00:15:29.290 --> 00:15:29.300
and code and implementation issues there
 

00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:36.010
and code and implementation issues there
let's move to mobile apps sure so if I

00:15:36.010 --> 00:15:36.020
let's move to mobile apps sure so if I
 

00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:37.060
let's move to mobile apps sure so if I
think the users out there who are using

00:15:37.060 --> 00:15:37.070
think the users out there who are using
 

00:15:37.070 --> 00:15:39.880
think the users out there who are using
SDK version 1 that's really the library

00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:39.890
SDK version 1 that's really the library
 

00:15:39.890 --> 00:15:41.080
SDK version 1 that's really the library
that we're talking about those are the

00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:41.090
that we're talking about those are the
 

00:15:41.090 --> 00:15:41.920
that we're talking about those are the
people who are going to be upgrading

00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:41.930
people who are going to be upgrading
 

00:15:41.930 --> 00:15:44.560
people who are going to be upgrading
because version 2 or higher are already

00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:44.570
because version 2 or higher are already
 

00:15:44.570 --> 00:15:46.870
because version 2 or higher are already
sending hits to Universal analytics so

00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:46.880
sending hits to Universal analytics so
 

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:50.470
sending hits to Universal analytics so
for those users using version 1 what

00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:50.480
for those users using version 1 what
 

00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:52.480
for those users using version 1 what
does the upgrade process look like for

00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:52.490
does the upgrade process look like for
 

00:15:52.490 --> 00:15:54.160
does the upgrade process look like for
them is it kind of the same thing as

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:54.170
them is it kind of the same thing as
 

00:15:54.170 --> 00:15:55.810
them is it kind of the same thing as
well it's similar but it's different so

00:15:55.810 --> 00:15:55.820
well it's similar but it's different so
 

00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:57.310
well it's similar but it's different so
it's important for mobile users to pay

00:15:57.310 --> 00:15:57.320
it's important for mobile users to pay
 

00:15:57.320 --> 00:15:58.180
it's important for mobile users to pay
attention yeah

00:15:58.180 --> 00:15:58.190
attention yeah
 

00:15:58.190 --> 00:16:00.160
attention yeah
step one of transferring from classic to

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:00.170
step one of transferring from classic to
 

00:16:00.170 --> 00:16:02.140
step one of transferring from classic to
Universal analytics continues to work

00:16:02.140 --> 00:16:02.150
Universal analytics continues to work
 

00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:04.630
Universal analytics continues to work
when you do the transfer you might see

00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:04.640
when you do the transfer you might see
 

00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:06.880
when you do the transfer you might see
some small differences in the way the

00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:06.890
some small differences in the way the
 

00:16:06.890 --> 00:16:08.860
some small differences in the way the
sessions are calculated you might have a

00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:08.870
sessions are calculated you might have a
 

00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:12.040
sessions are calculated you might have a
lower number of visits to the site but

00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:12.050
lower number of visits to the site but
 

00:16:12.050 --> 00:16:13.360
lower number of visits to the site but
there's no way around this this is just

00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:13.370
there's no way around this this is just
 

00:16:13.370 --> 00:16:15.310
there's no way around this this is just
the way that we're changing on how

00:16:15.310 --> 00:16:15.320
the way that we're changing on how
 

00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:17.020
the way that we're changing on how
sessions are calculated between the old

00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:17.030
sessions are calculated between the old
 

00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:19.510
sessions are calculated between the old
classic and into the new universal

00:16:19.510 --> 00:16:19.520
classic and into the new universal
 

00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:21.130
classic and into the new universal
analytics so you might see a slight

00:16:21.130 --> 00:16:21.140
analytics so you might see a slight
 

00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:23.620
analytics so you might see a slight
decrease in a number of visits in your

00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:23.630
decrease in a number of visits in your
 

00:16:23.630 --> 00:16:25.900
decrease in a number of visits in your
reporting profile and that's for

00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:25.910
reporting profile and that's for
 

00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:27.460
reporting profile and that's for
transferring on step one

00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:27.470
transferring on step one
 

00:16:27.470 --> 00:16:31.150
transferring on step one
once you've complete step one you'll

00:16:31.150 --> 00:16:31.160
once you've complete step one you'll
 

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:33.370
once you've complete step one you'll
continue to actually view your data in

00:16:33.370 --> 00:16:33.380
continue to actually view your data in
 

00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:36.910
continue to actually view your data in
Google Analytics as a web profile now

00:16:36.910 --> 00:16:36.920
Google Analytics as a web profile now
 

00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:39.280
Google Analytics as a web profile now
when we introduced app tracking last

00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:39.290
when we introduced app tracking last
 

00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:40.630
when we introduced app tracking last
year we introduced a brand new data

00:16:40.630 --> 00:16:40.640
year we introduced a brand new data
 

00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:42.610
year we introduced a brand new data
model you have tracking Google Analytics

00:16:42.610 --> 00:16:42.620
model you have tracking Google Analytics
 

00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:43.750
model you have tracking Google Analytics
it was actually really based on

00:16:43.750 --> 00:16:43.760
it was actually really based on
 

00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:45.670
it was actually really based on
universal analytics right but also came

00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:45.680
universal analytics right but also came
 

00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:47.740
universal analytics right but also came
with a new app tracking data model now

00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:47.750
with a new app tracking data model now
 

00:16:47.750 --> 00:16:49.510
with a new app tracking data model now
it's all around screen views and in

00:16:49.510 --> 00:16:49.520
it's all around screen views and in
 

00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:51.070
it's all around screen views and in
metrics that made sense for applications

00:16:51.070 --> 00:16:51.080
metrics that made sense for applications
 

00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:53.050
metrics that made sense for applications
we also created a whole new set of UI

00:16:53.050 --> 00:16:53.060
we also created a whole new set of UI
 

00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:57.040
we also created a whole new set of UI
reports specific to apps now those work

00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:57.050
reports specific to apps now those work
 

00:16:57.050 --> 00:17:00.040
reports specific to apps now those work
with SDK two plus versions but they

00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:00.050
with SDK two plus versions but they
 

00:17:00.050 --> 00:17:01.990
with SDK two plus versions but they
don't work what v1 is still using old

00:17:01.990 --> 00:17:02.000
don't work what v1 is still using old
 

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.560
don't work what v1 is still using old
page view tracking right so if you are

00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:05.570
page view tracking right so if you are
 

00:17:05.570 --> 00:17:08.560
page view tracking right so if you are
using v1 you have a couple options one

00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:08.570
using v1 you have a couple options one
 

00:17:08.570 --> 00:17:10.660
using v1 you have a couple options one
is to continue using the v1 SDK and

00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:10.670
is to continue using the v1 SDK and
 

00:17:10.670 --> 00:17:13.930
is to continue using the v1 SDK and
viewing your reports in web profiles is

00:17:13.930 --> 00:17:13.940
viewing your reports in web profiles is
 

00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:16.030
viewing your reports in web profiles is
the standard web profile the second

00:17:16.030 --> 00:17:16.040
the standard web profile the second
 

00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:17.410
the standard web profile the second
option you have is you can actually

00:17:17.410 --> 00:17:17.420
option you have is you can actually
 

00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:20.020
option you have is you can actually
upgrade to v2 change all your code from

00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:20.030
upgrade to v2 change all your code from
 

00:17:20.030 --> 00:17:22.630
upgrade to v2 change all your code from
page tracking to app tracking but today

00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:22.640
page tracking to app tracking but today
 

00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:24.370
page tracking to app tracking but today
if you view that in analytics you'll

00:17:24.370 --> 00:17:24.380
if you view that in analytics you'll
 

00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:25.569
if you view that in analytics you'll
actually have to create a new app

00:17:25.569 --> 00:17:25.579
actually have to create a new app
 

00:17:25.579 --> 00:17:27.939
actually have to create a new app
profile and all your data will be an app

00:17:27.939 --> 00:17:27.949
profile and all your data will be an app
 

00:17:27.949 --> 00:17:30.160
profile and all your data will be an app
profile right so the issue it becomes is

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:30.170
profile right so the issue it becomes is
 

00:17:30.170 --> 00:17:31.720
profile right so the issue it becomes is
that now all the new data is an app

00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:31.730
that now all the new data is an app
 

00:17:31.730 --> 00:17:32.380
that now all the new data is an app
profile

00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:32.390
profile
 

00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:34.110
profile
whereas all old data is in a web

00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:34.120
whereas all old data is in a web
 

00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:35.730
whereas all old data is in a web
right and so the challenge with that is

00:17:35.730 --> 00:17:35.740
right and so the challenge with that is
 

00:17:35.740 --> 00:17:37.350
right and so the challenge with that is
that you actually can't trend it over

00:17:37.350 --> 00:17:37.360
that you actually can't trend it over
 

00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:38.310
that you actually can't trend it over
time because there are different

00:17:38.310 --> 00:17:38.320
time because there are different
 

00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:40.560
time because there are different
profiles well you at least to some

00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:40.570
profiles well you at least to some
 

00:17:40.570 --> 00:17:43.640
profiles well you at least to some
reporting challenges guys so if you want

00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:43.650
reporting challenges guys so if you want
 

00:17:43.650 --> 00:17:46.320
reporting challenges guys so if you want
continuity between the data you would

00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:46.330
continuity between the data you would
 

00:17:46.330 --> 00:17:48.299
continuity between the data you would
complete step one transfer your property

00:17:48.299 --> 00:17:48.309
complete step one transfer your property
 

00:17:48.309 --> 00:17:48.870
complete step one transfer your property
yeah

00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:48.880
yeah
 

00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:51.240
yeah
don't upgrade your codes still use SDK

00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:51.250
don't upgrade your codes still use SDK
 

00:17:51.250 --> 00:17:53.250
don't upgrade your codes still use SDK
v1 and keep sending your hits there and

00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:53.260
v1 and keep sending your hits there and
 

00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:54.600
v1 and keep sending your hits there and
that will work fine and everything will

00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:54.610
that will work fine and everything will
 

00:17:54.610 --> 00:17:55.950
that will work fine and everything will
be continuous just like you'd expect

00:17:55.950 --> 00:17:55.960
be continuous just like you'd expect
 

00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:59.220
be continuous just like you'd expect
correct if you wanted to get access to

00:17:59.220 --> 00:17:59.230
correct if you wanted to get access to
 

00:17:59.230 --> 00:18:01.440
correct if you wanted to get access to
the new reporting features for apps all

00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:01.450
the new reporting features for apps all
 

00:18:01.450 --> 00:18:02.610
the new reporting features for apps all
the new stuff that we've launched for

00:18:02.610 --> 00:18:02.620
the new stuff that we've launched for
 

00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:04.170
the new stuff that we've launched for
apps you'd actually have to create a new

00:18:04.170 --> 00:18:04.180
apps you'd actually have to create a new
 

00:18:04.180 --> 00:18:06.570
apps you'd actually have to create a new
app profile or a new app view right and

00:18:06.570 --> 00:18:06.580
app profile or a new app view right and
 

00:18:06.580 --> 00:18:08.100
app profile or a new app view right and
then upgrade your code and send your

00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:08.110
then upgrade your code and send your
 

00:18:08.110 --> 00:18:09.690
then upgrade your code and send your
data to that when that causes the break

00:18:09.690 --> 00:18:09.700
data to that when that causes the break
 

00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:11.700
data to that when that causes the break
in continuity correct okay so it's a bit

00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:11.710
in continuity correct okay so it's a bit
 

00:18:11.710 --> 00:18:12.870
in continuity correct okay so it's a bit
of a trade-off it's a bit of a trade-off

00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:12.880
of a trade-off it's a bit of a trade-off
 

00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:14.070
of a trade-off it's a bit of a trade-off
right now right is it something that

00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:14.080
right now right is it something that
 

00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:17.220
right now right is it something that
we're working on so by all means like

00:18:17.220 --> 00:18:17.230
we're working on so by all means like
 

00:18:17.230 --> 00:18:19.560
we're working on so by all means like
there's no rush to actually retag to

00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:19.570
there's no rush to actually retag to
 

00:18:19.570 --> 00:18:22.500
there's no rush to actually retag to
version 2 but we do recommend at least

00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:22.510
version 2 but we do recommend at least
 

00:18:22.510 --> 00:18:25.020
version 2 but we do recommend at least
looking at step 1 to transfer from

00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:25.030
looking at step 1 to transfer from
 

00:18:25.030 --> 00:18:27.120
looking at step 1 to transfer from
classic to Universal a processing right

00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:27.130
classic to Universal a processing right
 

00:18:27.130 --> 00:18:29.280
classic to Universal a processing right
so step 1 everybody can do everybody can

00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:29.290
so step 1 everybody can do everybody can
 

00:18:29.290 --> 00:18:30.690
so step 1 everybody can do everybody can
do that today it's the REE tagging where

00:18:30.690 --> 00:18:30.700
do that today it's the REE tagging where
 

00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:32.730
do that today it's the REE tagging where
there's a couple considerations got it

00:18:32.730 --> 00:18:32.740
there's a couple considerations got it
 

00:18:32.740 --> 00:18:39.270
there's a couple considerations got it
cool great so we've covered step one and

00:18:39.270 --> 00:18:39.280
cool great so we've covered step one and
 

00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:41.220
cool great so we've covered step one and
step two of the upgrade process I

00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:41.230
step two of the upgrade process I
 

00:18:41.230 --> 00:18:42.840
step two of the upgrade process I
definitely wanted to ask you more about

00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:42.850
definitely wanted to ask you more about
 

00:18:42.850 --> 00:18:44.160
definitely wanted to ask you more about
the timeline because I'm very people

00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:44.170
the timeline because I'm very people
 

00:18:44.170 --> 00:18:45.960
the timeline because I'm very people
gonna be wondering when they need to

00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:45.970
gonna be wondering when they need to
 

00:18:45.970 --> 00:18:47.700
gonna be wondering when they need to
actually do this stuff and what we're

00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:47.710
actually do this stuff and what we're
 

00:18:47.710 --> 00:18:49.799
actually do this stuff and what we're
doing on our end as well

00:18:49.799 --> 00:18:49.809
doing on our end as well
 

00:18:49.809 --> 00:18:51.690
doing on our end as well
can you speak to so we got four phases

00:18:51.690 --> 00:18:51.700
can you speak to so we got four phases
 

00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:53.310
can you speak to so we got four phases
at this time and this is actually unique

00:18:53.310 --> 00:18:53.320
at this time and this is actually unique
 

00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:55.049
at this time and this is actually unique
because we published our time using we

00:18:55.049 --> 00:18:55.059
because we published our time using we
 

00:18:55.059 --> 00:18:56.250
because we published our time using we
never published timeline so there's

00:18:56.250 --> 00:18:56.260
never published timeline so there's
 

00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:57.930
never published timeline so there's
something yep it's pretty exciting it

00:18:57.930 --> 00:18:57.940
something yep it's pretty exciting it
 

00:18:57.940 --> 00:18:59.310
something yep it's pretty exciting it
yeah we try to be as transparent as

00:18:59.310 --> 00:18:59.320
yeah we try to be as transparent as
 

00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:02.250
yeah we try to be as transparent as
possible so we have four phases we're in

00:19:02.250 --> 00:19:02.260
possible so we have four phases we're in
 

00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:04.020
possible so we have four phases we're in
the first phase right cranny walk us

00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:04.030
the first phase right cranny walk us
 

00:19:04.030 --> 00:19:05.340
the first phase right cranny walk us
through where we are right now and where

00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:05.350
through where we are right now and where
 

00:19:05.350 --> 00:19:07.320
through where we are right now and where
we're where we're going right so phase 1

00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:07.330
we're where we're going right so phase 1
 

00:19:07.330 --> 00:19:09.150
we're where we're going right so phase 1
was really the launch an announcement

00:19:09.150 --> 00:19:09.160
was really the launch an announcement
 

00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:12.120
was really the launch an announcement
that we can actually do this upgrade our

00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:12.130
that we can actually do this upgrade our
 

00:19:12.130 --> 00:19:13.770
that we can actually do this upgrade our
goal at the end of the day is to

00:19:13.770 --> 00:19:13.780
goal at the end of the day is to
 

00:19:13.780 --> 00:19:16.620
goal at the end of the day is to
transfer 100% of properties from classic

00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:16.630
transfer 100% of properties from classic
 

00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:19.049
transfer 100% of properties from classic
to Universal analytics as well as get

00:19:19.049 --> 00:19:19.059
to Universal analytics as well as get
 

00:19:19.059 --> 00:19:21.990
to Universal analytics as well as get
everybody to upgrade and to start only

00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:22.000
everybody to upgrade and to start only
 

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.049
everybody to upgrade and to start only
building features on Universal analytics

00:19:24.049 --> 00:19:24.059
building features on Universal analytics
 

00:19:24.059 --> 00:19:26.940
building features on Universal analytics
so we announced the upgrade so people

00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:26.950
so we announced the upgrade so people
 

00:19:26.950 --> 00:19:28.560
so we announced the upgrade so people
can migrate from the classic to end up

00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:28.570
can migrate from the classic to end up
 

00:19:28.570 --> 00:19:29.850
can migrate from the classic to end up
until Universal analytics a couple

00:19:29.850 --> 00:19:29.860
until Universal analytics a couple
 

00:19:29.860 --> 00:19:31.680
until Universal analytics a couple
months ago so that's where we are

00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:31.690
months ago so that's where we are
 

00:19:31.690 --> 00:19:34.710
months ago so that's where we are
phase 2 is that we realized many people

00:19:34.710 --> 00:19:34.720
phase 2 is that we realized many people
 

00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:37.140
phase 2 is that we realized many people
won't actually go through this step one

00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:37.150
won't actually go through this step one
 

00:19:37.150 --> 00:19:40.169
won't actually go through this step one
transferring so what we plan to do is to

00:19:40.169 --> 00:19:40.179
transferring so what we plan to do is to
 

00:19:40.179 --> 00:19:43.050
transferring so what we plan to do is to
start Auto transferring properties from

00:19:43.050 --> 00:19:43.060
start Auto transferring properties from
 

00:19:43.060 --> 00:19:44.410
start Auto transferring properties from
classic to Universal analytics

00:19:44.410 --> 00:19:44.420
classic to Universal analytics
 

00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:46.300
classic to Universal analytics
so what that means is instead of the

00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:46.310
so what that means is instead of the
 

00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:48.160
so what that means is instead of the
end-users going into the interface and

00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:48.170
end-users going into the interface and
 

00:19:48.170 --> 00:19:49.900
end-users going into the interface and
admin tool and in transferring right

00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:49.910
admin tool and in transferring right
 

00:19:49.910 --> 00:19:51.790
admin tool and in transferring right
will manually go in and set that bit for

00:19:51.790 --> 00:19:51.800
will manually go in and set that bit for
 

00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:54.040
will manually go in and set that bit for
them and then over time their stuff will

00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:54.050
them and then over time their stuff will
 

00:19:54.050 --> 00:19:56.530
them and then over time their stuff will
be transferred on the processing side so

00:19:56.530 --> 00:19:56.540
be transferred on the processing side so
 

00:19:56.540 --> 00:19:58.600
be transferred on the processing side so
when does that happen so we've started

00:19:58.600 --> 00:19:58.610
when does that happen so we've started
 

00:19:58.610 --> 00:20:00.400
when does that happen so we've started
with some test accounts and that will

00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:00.410
with some test accounts and that will
 

00:20:00.410 --> 00:20:03.460
with some test accounts and that will
start will start ramping up probably

00:20:03.460 --> 00:20:03.470
start will start ramping up probably
 

00:20:03.470 --> 00:20:05.620
start will start ramping up probably
within the next month or so to start

00:20:05.620 --> 00:20:05.630
within the next month or so to start
 

00:20:05.630 --> 00:20:07.840
within the next month or so to start
with small accounts accounts that have

00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:07.850
with small accounts accounts that have
 

00:20:07.850 --> 00:20:10.030
with small accounts accounts that have
much lower risk of having data quality

00:20:10.030 --> 00:20:10.040
much lower risk of having data quality
 

00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:12.340
much lower risk of having data quality
issues and then over time as we get full

00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:12.350

feature parity will then start ramping

00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:14.570
feature parity will then start ramping
 

00:20:14.570 --> 00:20:16.630
feature parity will then start ramping
that up to account the larger accounts

00:20:16.630 --> 00:20:16.640
