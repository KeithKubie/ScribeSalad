none and so it was easy to imagine that
 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.480
none and so it was easy to imagine that
they were great systems so people who

made no difference at all because the

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750
made no difference at all because the
 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.140
made no difference at all because the
people couldn't imagine what kind of

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150
people couldn't imagine what kind of

years later John McCord followed up on

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870
years later John McCord followed up on
 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.680
years later John McCord followed up on
those two groups one group had

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690
those two groups one group had
 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.970
those two groups one group had
significantly higher rates of suicide

more they ended up in lower-class jobs I
 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.460
more they ended up in lower-class jobs I
mean it was just sort of every sort of

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470
mean it was just sort of every sort of
 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.300
mean it was just sort of every sort of
bad thing you could imagine they had

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310
bad thing you could imagine they had
 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:21.509

people who had this kind of thing
 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.039
people who had this kind of thing
happened to them and which group was

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:27.049
happened to them and which group was
 

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:30.069
happened to them and which group was
that it was the group they caught all

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:30.079
that it was the group they caught all
 

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:32.979
that it was the group they caught all
the help and what was interesting was

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:32.989
the help and what was interesting was
 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:36.009
the help and what was interesting was
that the people involved in the study

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:36.019
that the people involved in the study
 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:38.910
that the people involved in the study
were convinced that they weren't helping

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920
were convinced that they weren't helping
 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:43.030
were convinced that they weren't helping
that group but it backfired and it was

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040
that group but it backfired and it was
 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.580
that group but it backfired and it was
only when they they really went in and

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590
only when they they really went in and
 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:48.190
only when they they really went in and
looked carefully at the data that they

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:48.200
looked carefully at the data that they
 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.699
looked carefully at the data that they
found that this wonderful helping was

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:51.709
found that this wonderful helping was
 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:54.030
found that this wonderful helping was
making the researchers and the

making the researchers and the
 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.380
making the researchers and the
participants feel very good but it was

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:56.390
participants feel very good but it was
 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:58.930
participants feel very good but it was
actually harming the boys that they

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940
actually harming the boys that they
 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.840
actually harming the boys that they
wanted to help so some of my research

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:01.850
wanted to help so some of my research

sometimes paved by good intentions it's
 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:14.080
sometimes paved by good intentions it's
it's very important to be aware that

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090
it's very important to be aware that
 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:17.199
it's very important to be aware that
sometimes you can be totally convinced

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:17.209
sometimes you can be totally convinced
 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:19.750
