00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.090
A great place to start when
researching your distribution plan

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:04.580
is through Google Trends.

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:07.220
Google Trends is
a completely free service

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:10.340
that allows you to see
the popularity of search terms

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:14.140
in relation to the total volume
of search terms across the world.

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:15.650
And in various languages.

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.952
Google processes over 40,000 search
queries every single second, and

00:00:19.952 --> 00:00:23.270
they're willing to share
those insights with you.

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:26.550
The reason why this is a great place to
start is that not only can you see some

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.970
really interesting things from
all of these search queries,

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.479
like the most searched topic of the day.

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:35.660
But you can also see the history
of these search terms and

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:37.240
of related terms for your business.

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:38.910
So I have Ronnie here with me,

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.140
let's use her expertise to dive
into Google Trends a little bit.

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.810
&gt;&gt; Let's go to Google Trends and
see what comes up.

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:50.670
Let's go to explore topics and
type in pet sitting.

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.100
So we see here that interest over
time is relatively consistent,

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.760
although I see that there are some big-
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's interesting.

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.640
&gt;&gt; If you look at the dates, yeah,

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.760
you can see that there
is a peak every summer.

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:04.470
&gt;&gt; Oh yeah.

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.740
&gt;&gt; So people are searching more for pet
sitting during their summer vacations.

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.140
&gt;&gt; Yeah and maybe not as much
during their holiday vacations,

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:12.220
that's interesting.

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:13.330
&gt;&gt; Yeah let's scroll down.

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.170
&gt;&gt; So what are these regional interests?

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:20.370
&gt;&gt; Here we can see where
the search term is most popular.

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:22.350
&gt;&gt; So
like the United States is most popular?

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.410
&gt;&gt; Yeah, you can see here
the United States, it has 100.

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:27.960
So this is where
the search is most common.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.430
The place with the greatest
volume will always have 100, and

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:37.510
then all the other numbers here
are always relative to the 100 number.

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:40.550
Okay, so we see that people in
the United States, Canada, Australia and

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:43.820
even the United Kingdom, I guess,
are the most interested in pet setting.

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.825
&gt;&gt; Not exactly, we can assume that these
countries are the top ones to search

00:01:47.825 --> 00:01:50.900
this exact search term in English.

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:54.460
So it's not that surprising that
the top countries are English-speaking

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:55.360
countries.

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.250
Let's make sure we
compare apples to apples.

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.930
So, either we compare a few different
English-speaking regions or

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.500
we decide to compare between
different search terms.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.710
&gt;&gt; So, if we click on United States,
let's see a breakdown.

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:11.770
So pet sitting is the most popular
in New Hampshire, it seems, and

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.770
North Carolina, Arizona, Colorado.

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.360
&gt;&gt; Yeah, actually, we can choose
these regions as our pilot regions or

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.280
something like that.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.310
&gt;&gt; Oh, that's awesome.

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.280
&gt;&gt; Let's go back for
a second with the world wide view.

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.858
This can also give us insights
on popular related terms.

00:02:25.858 --> 00:02:28.190
Let's go down.

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.410
This can also give us insights about
related searches and related terms.

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:37.320
So in our messaging and tag line and
wording that we use in our website and

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.620
messaging, we can use not
only dog sitting, but

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.910
also pet sitters, pet sitter,
pet care, pet sitting services.

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.610
And other terms that people
already search more.

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.794
&gt;&gt; It's cool how they break it down
I'm sure that'll help you develop what

00:02:49.794 --> 00:02:51.373
keywords you're going to want to use.

00:02:51.373 --> 00:02:53.220
&gt;&gt; Let's go back to the top.

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.020
I want to show you
the categories section.

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.820
&gt;&gt; Here?

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.190
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
this can be very helpful in research.

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.177
So we have options like Hobbies
&amp; Leisure, Pets &amp; Animals,

00:03:03.177 --> 00:03:04.810
Jobs &amp; Education.

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.520
Categories are important if you want to
expand into the Google Display Network.

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:13.430
The Google Display Network allows you to
place display ads on related websites.

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.630
And you can choose where to
advertise based on categories.

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:20.850
What we learn here will help us choose
a category of websites to advertise in.

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:24.410
Clearly pets and animals seems relevant
to us, but look, under jobs and

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:28.360
education, the interesting
pet sitting shot up after 28.

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.590
&gt;&gt; That's interesting, I would have
never thought to look at this.

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:33.230
So what else can we find in web search?

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:35.500
&gt;&gt; Just a second, before we do that,
let's go back to jobs and

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.050
education and go back to all categories.

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:41.970
&gt;&gt; Yeah so this will show us the
interest level based on specific types

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:42.640
of searches.

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.820
For example, if we learn that our top
search term is super popular in image

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:52.250
search too, we might consider this
as another advertising option.

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:55.460
We can make sure that there are plenty
of relevant images that will link

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:56.990
back to our website.

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:59.724
Another cool thing you can do is
actually to compare different search

00:03:59.724 --> 00:04:02.580
terms, and it's not necessarily for
image search, it can be for

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:03.270
web search too.

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:05.670
&gt;&gt; Let's go back to web search and-
&gt;&gt; Yeah,

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:09.650
let's just add another term,
like dog services.

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:14.350
And it's interesting to see that
maybe a few years ago, the demand was

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:18.610
quite similar, but recently, you can
see that the demand for the red one,

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:22.520
which is dog service,
is much higher than pet sitting.

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:23.090
&gt;&gt; It's interesting.

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:25.925
Yeah, pet sitting seems
to slowly be declining.

00:04:25.925 --> 00:04:29.470
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so whether you have to decide
how to phrase your tag line or which key

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:34.260
words to choose for your campaign,
either way it helps you focus better.

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.190
Sometimes it can really show
you the demand of the market.

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:41.190
I mean if people search more for
Product X or Product Ym so

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:44.540
you can develop the product that
has more demand on Google Search.

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:47.350
Demand can be seasonal,
as you can see here.

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:51.299
So you could use that either to choose
which app to develop or at least to plan

00:04:51.299 --> 00:04:55.250
your advertising campaigns around
things people search for on holidays or

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:58.220
in the Summer, or
around back to school, for example.

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:01.540
So for us, if we see in that during
summer people are searching more for

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:04.130
pet sitting, we know that this is
a time where we want to really,

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:05.720
really hit our campaigns.

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:08.370
&gt;&gt; It's surprising to see
how seasonal pet sitting is.

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:11.970
So maybe we should target families
more than just business people.

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:13.550
&gt;&gt; Yeah, we learned something.

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:14.480
&gt;&gt; Look at that.

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:16.805
Okay, well let's go to
a question about this.

00:05:16.805 --> 00:05:18.100
Okay, so we saw this tool.

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:20.460
I think it's pretty awesome, and
I could have a lot of fun with it, but

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:23.060
I think it's time for
you to explore it a little bit more.

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:24.490
I want you to go to Google Trends and

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:27.100
explore a search term
that's related to your app.

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:28.160
If you don't have one, go ahead and

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:31.400
use Embarkment, but
don't use the same search term we did.

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.270
Then fill in the blanks below.

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:35.500
First I want you to tell
us what term you used.

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:38.310
Then what city was that
term most popular in?

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:39.780
Then check out the related terms.

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:42.580
What are the two most
popular related terms?

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:44.540
Add one here and here.

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:46.020
And finally, just for fun,

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:49.710
what was the most surprising thing you
found out when exploring Google Trends?
