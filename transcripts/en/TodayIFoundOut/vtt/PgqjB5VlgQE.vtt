00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:10.219
That Time Pepsi Promised to Give Away a Harrier
Jet

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:15.869
Back in the halcyon days of 1995, Pepsi launched
their aptly titled “Drink Pepsi, Get Stuff”

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:20.680
campaign that allowed customers to earn points
on every Pepsi product they bought and then

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.430
exchange them for things like Pepsi branded
t-shirts and hats.

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:29.369
The promotion was a roaring success and resulted
in nothing of note happening whatsoever…

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.489
unless of course you count the guy who sued
them because they refused to exchange 7,000,000

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:36.020
Pepsi points for a Harrier Jet.

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.850
The man in question was John Leonard and in
the later months of 1995 he turned on his

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.370
TV and saw this ad announcing the Pepsi Stuff
promotion.

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.329
For those who aren’t interested in watching
the advertisement, it essentially shows a

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.630
teen on his way to school, highlighting items
one can buy with Pepsi points, such as a Pepsi

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:57.800
T-shirt for 75 points, a leather jacket for
1450 points, etc.

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:04.280
The book The Law of Marketing, by Lynda J.
Oswald, describes what happens next in exquisite

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:05.370
detail:

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:09.640
The scene then shifts to three young boys
sitting in front of a high school building.

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.780
The boy in the middle is intent on his Pepsi
Stuff Catalog, while the boys on either side

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:14.900
are each drinking Pepsi.

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:20.400
The three boys gaze in awe at an object rushing
overhead, as the military march builds to

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.480
a crescendo.

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:26.540
The Harrier Jet is not yet visible, but the
observer senses the presence of a mighty plane

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:31.930
as the extreme winds generated by its flight
create a paper maelstrom in a classroom devoted

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:34.240
to an otherwise dull physics lesson.

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.600
Finally, the Harrier Jet swings into view
and lands by the side of the school building,

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.250
next to a bicycle rack.

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.600
Several students run for cover, and the velocity
of the wind strips one hapless faculty member

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.110
down to his underwear.

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.890
While the faculty member is being deprived
of his dignity, the voice-over announces:

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.050
“Now the more Pepsi you drink, the more
great stuff you’re gonna get.”

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:58.910
The following words then appear: “HARRIER
FIGHTER 7,000,000 PEPSI POINTS.”

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:03.160
Upon seeing the commercial, Leonard, a 21
year old business student, did a little research

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:09.290
and came to a startling conclusion- the Pepsi
Harrier giveaway was actually an amazing deal

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:10.910
at only 7,000,000 points.

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:17.730
You see, in 1995, the value of a single Harrier
Jet was about $33 million, give or take a

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.900
few million depending on whose estimates you
want to use.

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:26.480
This meant that even if every 2 litre bottle
of Pepsi only awarded a single point (in reality

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.670
many bottles and cans offered more depending
on where they were purchased), the Harrier

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.940
would still only cost about $7 million in
real money.

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:39.220
To confirm there were no loopholes here, Leonard
got his hands on a Pepsi Stuff prize catalogue.

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.380
While no Harriet Jet was listed there, he
did notice it stated in the small print that

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:48.970
if a person already had 15 Pepsi Points, they
could purchase an unlimited number of additional

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.650
points towards any item they wanted for 10
cents apiece.

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.170
This meant Leonard could actually effectively
purchase the Harrier for a mere $700,000,

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.340
and wouldn’t need to pre-purchase millions
of dollars of Pepsi products to do it, making

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.860
the whole business venture significantly less
risky from a financial standpoint.

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:11.410
And so it was that on March 27th of the following
year, Leonard sent 15 Pepsi Points, an order

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:17.740
form with the words “1 Harrier Jet” written
in the item description, and a cheque for

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:27.819
$700,008.50 ($699,998.50 for the remaining
6,999,985 points and $10 for shipping and

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:30.600
handling) to the required address and waited.

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.700
Pepsi, upon receiving the order, sent the
cheque back with a letter explaining that

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.570
the Harrier Jet was “not part of the offer”,
nor was it included in the prize catalogue,

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:42.580
and that its inclusion in the advertisement
was merely intended as “fanciful” addition

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:44.370
to make the ad more entertaining.

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:48.420
The letter also included a bunch of coupons
to apologise for “any misunderstanding or

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:49.420
confusion”.

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:53.660
Of course, Leonard was dead serious, in the
previous year having managed to convince five

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:56.450
unnamed investors to back his little venture.

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:00.830
When later asked by the news about why he
was so intent on getting a Harrier Jet, Leonard

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:05.370
explained that as a member of the so-called
“Pepsi generation” the company was advertising

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:09.480
to, the “notion of owning a Harrier Jet
appealed to him enormously”.

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.880
Of course, with investors involved, it’s
far more likely the group was simply looking

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:15.260
for a large out of court settlement.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:19.269
Whatever the case, when Leonard received the
response from Pepsi, his lawyer responded

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:22.470
in turn on May 14, 1996:

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:26.110
Your letter of May 7, 1996 is totally unacceptable.

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:30.230
We have reviewed the video tape of the Pepsi
Stuff commercial… and it clearly offers

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:33.710
the new Harrier jet for 7,000,000 Pepsi points.

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:36.270
Our client followed your rules explicitly…

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:40.430
This is a formal demand that you honor your
commitment and make immediate arrangements

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:43.400
to transfer the new Harrier jet to our client.

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.970
If we do not receive transfer instructions
within ten (10) business days of the date

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:51.550
of this letter you will leave us no choice
but to file an appropriate action against

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:52.550
Pepsi.

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:56.340
Oddly, rather than reply themselves this time,
Pepsi forwarded the letter to the ad company

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:01.630
responsible for the commercial, who replied
to Leonard stating that the offer “was clearly

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:06.020
a joke”, adding that they found it hard
to believe anyone had actually taken it seriously.

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:10.889
However, perhaps at least being a little nervous
over the issue, in order to avoid copycat

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:15.700
lawsuits, Pepsi promptly changed the price
of the jet in the ad from 7,000,000 Pepsi

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:17.600
Points to 700,000,000.

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:21.740
But they still had to deal with Leonard, who
sued Pepsi for fraud, breach of contract and

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:23.230
deceptive advertising.

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:26.139
The case limped through the courts for three
years.

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:30.380
While the court of public opinion was strongly
on the side of Leonard and his investors-

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:35.310
after all, the commercial clearly stated that
if you acquired seven million Pepsi points,

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:39.450
you could exchange them for a Harrier jet-
the court that actually had power to issue

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:40.690
a ruling was not.

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:45.660
The issue was finally settled in 1999 with
the judge concluding that “no objective

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:50.120
person could reasonably have concluded that
the commercial actually offered consumers

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:51.450
a Harrier Jet”.

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:56.080
It is notable that Leonard’s legal team
attempted to argue that no judge could accurately

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:01.120
determine whether the target audience of the
commercial, the ‘Pepsi Generation’, would

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:04.520
or would not conclude that the commercial
was really offering a jet.

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:08.910
Specifically noting, “a federal judge [is]
incapable of deciding on the matter, and that

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:14.000
instead the decision had to be made by a jury
consisting of members of the ‘Pepsi Generation’

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.229
to whom the advertisement would allegedly
constitute an offer.”

00:06:17.229 --> 00:06:21.460
In any event, in regards to the accusation
of fraud, this too was thrown out as commercials

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:26.229
aren’t considered legally binding offers
under the Restatement (Second) of Contracts

00:06:26.229 --> 00:06:28.410
treatise, which notes:

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:32.880
Advertisements of goods by display, sign,
handbill, newspaper, radio or television are

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:36.520
not ordinarily intended or understood as offers
to sell.

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:41.320
The same is true of catalogues, price lists
and circulars, even though the terms of suggested

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:43.860
bargains may be stated in some detail.

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:48.060
It is of course possible to make an offer
by an advertisement directed to the general

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:53.110
public, but there must ordinarily be some
language of commitment or some invitation

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:55.720
to take action without further communication.

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:59.380
Finally, the courts ruled that not giving
Leonard the Harrier wasn’t in breach of

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:04.220
contract as no written agreement between the
two parties involving the giving or receiving

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:06.639
of a jet had been drafted or signed.

00:07:06.639 --> 00:07:11.060
As Arthur Linton Corbin notes in Corbin on
Contracts, “There would be no enforceable

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:16.289
contract until [the] defendant [Pepsi Co.]
accepted the Order Form and cashed the check.”

00:07:16.289 --> 00:07:19.260
As Pepsi did neither, there was no breach
of contract.

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:23.009
This all leaves one wondering, had the court
ruled otherwise, would Pepsi have been able

00:07:23.009 --> 00:07:24.590
to give Leonard the jet?

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:29.430
The answer, according to Pentagon spokesman
Ken Bacon, was decidedly no.

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:33.480
In response to Bacon’s assertions, Leonard
stated that he would take a Harrier Jet “in

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:36.370
a form that eliminated [its] potential for
military use”.

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:40.979
The U.S. military has in the past, for instance,
sold tanks to civilians after their weaponry

00:07:40.979 --> 00:07:42.199
was removed.

00:07:42.199 --> 00:07:45.990
In response to that, Bacon claimed that doing
the same to the jet would strip it of its

00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:48.240
ability to fly, rendering it useless.

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:52.690
That’s not to mention that a Harrier Jet
uses a massive amount of fuel per minute of

00:07:52.690 --> 00:07:57.100
flight, varying depending on what you’re
doing at the time, and requires millions of

00:07:57.100 --> 00:08:01.030
dollars of maintenance over the course of
its lifetime, both of which make it prohibitively

00:08:01.030 --> 00:08:03.240
expensive for any but the richest of civilians
to operate.

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:07.620
But, of course, it is likely Leonard and his
investors were never actually interested in

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:11.259
the jet, just the potential payout if the
court ruled in their favor.

00:08:11.259 --> 00:08:34.610
Leonard attempted to appeal the court’s
decision in 2000, with 

00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:59.440
the ruling 

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:53.250
ultimately upheld.
