Pugwash to talk I gave a talk two years

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:08.320
Pugwash to talk I gave a talk two years
 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.140
Pugwash to talk I gave a talk two years
ago I think maybe one and a half years

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:10.150
ago I think maybe one and a half years
 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:11.970
ago I think maybe one and a half years
ago in Pugwash to a little tiny group of

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:11.980
ago in Pugwash to a little tiny group of
 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:14.070
ago in Pugwash to a little tiny group of
people and it was fun and they emailed

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:14.080
people and it was fun and they emailed
 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:14.879
people and it was fun and they emailed
me and said we should come back and do

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:14.889
me and said we should come back and do
 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:16.800
me and said we should come back and do
it again so I was expecting a little

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:16.810
it again so I was expecting a little
 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:18.060
it again so I was expecting a little
tiny group of people but we didn't quite

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:18.070
tiny group of people but we didn't quite
 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:21.630
tiny group of people but we didn't quite
get that I am happy to see that more

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:21.640
get that I am happy to see that more
 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:22.740
get that I am happy to see that more
people are becoming interested in these

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:22.750
people are becoming interested in these
 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:24.060
people are becoming interested in these
issues and I think there's a reason for

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:24.070
issues and I think there's a reason for
 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:25.640
issues and I think there's a reason for
that and we'll get into that as I talk

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650
that and we'll get into that as I talk
 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.080
that and we'll get into that as I talk
this is a difficult talk to give because

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:28.090
this is a difficult talk to give because
 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:30.150
this is a difficult talk to give because
not technical talk is to talk about

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:30.160
not technical talk is to talk about
 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.100
not technical talk is to talk about
philosophy in a way and emotion and

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:32.110
philosophy in a way and emotion and
 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:34.080
philosophy in a way and emotion and
these things can be emotional and they

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:34.090
these things can be emotional and they
 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:36.030
these things can be emotional and they
can cause emotional results in people at

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:36.040
can cause emotional results in people at
 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.770
can cause emotional results in people at
the same time I'm not a philosopher and

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:37.780
the same time I'm not a philosopher and
 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.320
the same time I'm not a philosopher and
I will not claim to have training in

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:40.330
I will not claim to have training in
 

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:42.840
I will not claim to have training in
that area and regime so what I say is

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:42.850
that area and regime so what I say is
 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:45.360
that area and regime so what I say is
personal and hopefully the beginning of

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:45.370
personal and hopefully the beginning of
 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:47.490
personal and hopefully the beginning of
a discussion that people can have but in

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:47.500
a discussion that people can have but in
 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.500
a discussion that people can have but in
no way can it be taken to be the proper

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:49.510
no way can it be taken to be the proper
 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:51.150
no way can it be taken to be the proper
semantic philosophical approach to

semantic philosophical approach to
 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:52.290
semantic philosophical approach to
having these kinds of discussions in

having these kinds of discussions in

if you will nevertheless I'll act like

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:56.140
if you will nevertheless I'll act like
 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.520
if you will nevertheless I'll act like
one at times so leave me that freedom

00:00:59.520 --> 00:00:59.530
one at times so leave me that freedom

please so I'm gonna talk about ethics

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:01.900
please so I'm gonna talk about ethics
 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.619
please so I'm gonna talk about ethics
and I think the obvious first way to

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:04.629
and I think the obvious first way to
 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:07.500
and I think the obvious first way to
start is to talk about my history about

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:07.510
start is to talk about my history about
 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:08.910
start is to talk about my history about
my story of how I became a roboticist

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:08.920
my story of how I became a roboticist
 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.700
my story of how I became a roboticist
and when I became aware that I was

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:11.710
and when I became aware that I was
 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:13.710
and when I became aware that I was
seeing something in this that made me

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:13.720
seeing something in this that made me
 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.270
seeing something in this that made me
want to act ethically and understand

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280
want to act ethically and understand
 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.940
want to act ethically and understand
what ethics means via via technology so

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950
what ethics means via via technology so
 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.100
what ethics means via via technology so

University I was a student and I took a

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:22.630
University I was a student and I took a
 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:24.360
University I was a student and I took a
class from this fellow Terry Winograd

class from this fellow Terry Winograd
 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:27.840

he's still a professor there and it was

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850
he's still a professor there and it was
 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:28.950
he's still a professor there and it was
an interesting time because what

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:28.960
an interesting time because what
 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.720
an interesting time because what
happened was a couple of things at the

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:30.730
happened was a couple of things at the
 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:33.000

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:33.010
same time I have sort of two slides that
 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:34.440
same time I have sort of two slides that
tell the story of how this this

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450
tell the story of how this this
 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.420

talked about computer professionals for
 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.240
talked about computer professionals for
social responsibility the same time I

was working in robotics and there was

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:44.409
was working in robotics and there was
 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:45.990
was working in robotics and there was
something like four faculty at Stanford

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.000
something like four faculty at Stanford
 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
something like four faculty at Stanford
in the computer science department doing

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:48.010
in the computer science department doing
 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:49.890
in the computer science department doing
robotics they didn't talk to each other

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:49.900
robotics they didn't talk to each other
 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.630
robotics they didn't talk to each other
in fact they all had robots they didn't

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640
in fact they all had robots they didn't
 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:52.590
in fact they all had robots they didn't
communicate with each other they didn't

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600
communicate with each other they didn't
 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.510
communicate with each other they didn't
really collaborate with each other and I

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520
really collaborate with each other and I
 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:55.890
really collaborate with each other and I
spent probably six months trying to get

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:55.900
spent probably six months trying to get
 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:57.090
spent probably six months trying to get
them to be in the same room at the same

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100
them to be in the same room at the same
 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.710
them to be in the same room at the same
time in an attempt to get them to

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720
time in an attempt to get them to
 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.570
time in an attempt to get them to
collaborate and they met in the same

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:00.580
collaborate and they met in the same
 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:01.680
collaborate and they met in the same
room at the same time and then parted

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:01.690
room at the same time and then parted
 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:02.940
room at the same time and then parted
ways again and wouldn't talk to each

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950
ways again and wouldn't talk to each
 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.039
ways again and wouldn't talk to each
other anymore afterwards either it was

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:05.049
other anymore afterwards either it was
 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:06.840
other anymore afterwards either it was
fascinating you know it isn't that they

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850
fascinating you know it isn't that they
 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:08.609
fascinating you know it isn't that they
were angry at each other or mad or

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619
were angry at each other or mad or
 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:11.040
were angry at each other or mad or
unable to speak to each other it's that

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050
unable to speak to each other it's that
 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:12.180
unable to speak to each other it's that
they thought of their research as a

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190
they thought of their research as a
 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:13.740
they thought of their research as a
piece of as a silo is it

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750
piece of as a silo is it
 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.270
piece of as a silo is it
individual piece of work that they do

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280
individual piece of work that they do
 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.610
individual piece of work that they do
with their group and that research

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620
with their group and that research
 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.260
with their group and that research
inherently doesn't involve sharing even

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270
inherently doesn't involve sharing even
 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:20.580
inherently doesn't involve sharing even
with somebody in your own department I

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590
with somebody in your own department I
 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.500
with somebody in your own department I
was really struck by that and I talked

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510
was really struck by that and I talked
 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.570
was really struck by that and I talked
to Terry a good deal about that and I

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580
to Terry a good deal about that and I
 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:25.920
to Terry a good deal about that and I
talked about the culture of the

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930
talked about the culture of the
 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.840
talked about the culture of the
university and how one could try to

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850
university and how one could try to
 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:29.760
university and how one could try to
change it I was really upset that I

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770
change it I was really upset that I
 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:31.949
change it I was really upset that I
couldn't change it in that case and he

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959
couldn't change it in that case and he
 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:33.630
couldn't change it in that case and he
had this interesting counsel which is he

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640
had this interesting counsel which is he
 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:34.890
had this interesting counsel which is he
he said you can't change it from the

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900
he said you can't change it from the
 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.270
he said you can't change it from the
outside you can't change it as long as

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280
outside you can't change it as long as
 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.250
outside you can't change it as long as
you're a student become a professor and

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260
you're a student become a professor and
 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:39.060
you're a student become a professor and
then try and change it from the inside

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070
then try and change it from the inside
 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:40.380
then try and change it from the inside
and that's the only way you can possibly

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390
and that's the only way you can possibly
 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.600
and that's the only way you can possibly
have any impact and that was really

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610
have any impact and that was really
 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:43.590
have any impact and that was really
interesting to me it was very empowering

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.600
interesting to me it was very empowering
 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.540
interesting to me it was very empowering
to hear somebody say you couldn't change

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550
to hear somebody say you couldn't change
 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:48.390
to hear somebody say you couldn't change
it unfortunately it was a rather high

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400
it unfortunately it was a rather high
 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.890
it unfortunately it was a rather high
bar right I'm a lowly grad student being

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900
bar right I'm a lowly grad student being
 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.840
bar right I'm a lowly grad student being
told first to become a professor and

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850
told first to become a professor and
 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:54.240
told first to become a professor and
then change it so you know both of those

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250
then change it so you know both of those
 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.479
then change it so you know both of those

robots are nothing but a simple

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:02.680
robots are nothing but a simple
 

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:04.140

extension of the current technologies

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:04.150
extension of the current technologies
 

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:05.970
extension of the current technologies
and there were people in the class who

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:05.980
and there were people in the class who
 

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:08.150
and there were people in the class who
believed robots should never make

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:08.160
believed robots should never make
 

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:12.090

life-or-death decisions so what struck

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:12.100
life-or-death decisions so what struck
 

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:14.970

me as odd is that by 2004 I didn't have

me as odd is that by 2004 I didn't have
 

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:17.460
me as odd is that by 2004 I didn't have
any debate anymore everybody in the

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:17.470
any debate anymore everybody in the
 

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:19.650
any debate anymore everybody in the
class is agreed year after year you

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:19.660
class is agreed year after year you

out those letters there would have been
 

00:11:56.449 --> 00:11:57.759
out those letters there would have been
questions and there would have been

00:11:57.759 --> 00:11:57.769
questions and there would have been
 

00:11:57.769 --> 00:12:00.400

these kinds of robots or their kinds of
 

00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:03.819
these kinds of robots or their kinds of
robots you don't build is there a kind

00:12:03.819 --> 00:12:03.829
robots you don't build is there a kind
 

00:12:03.829 --> 00:12:05.069
robots you don't build is there a kind
of robot that's not quite right to build

00:12:05.069 --> 00:12:05.079
of robot that's not quite right to build
 

00:12:05.079 --> 00:12:07.360
of robot that's not quite right to build
so again it's a really interesting

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:07.370
so again it's a really interesting
 

00:12:07.370 --> 00:12:11.170
so again it's a really interesting
example of how we relate to our society

00:12:11.170 --> 00:12:11.180
example of how we relate to our society
 

00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:14.319

and how we can justify in some ways very

00:12:14.319 --> 00:12:14.329
and how we can justify in some ways very
 

00:12:14.329 --> 00:12:16.509
and how we can justify in some ways very
rightly and in some ways wrongly what we

00:12:16.509 --> 00:12:16.519
rightly and in some ways wrongly what we
 

00:12:16.519 --> 00:12:19.269
rightly and in some ways wrongly what we
do okay that's the that's the

00:12:19.269 --> 00:12:19.279
do okay that's the that's the
 

00:12:19.279 --> 00:12:20.650
do okay that's the that's the
introduction those are kind of

00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:20.660
introduction those are kind of
 

00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:21.730
introduction those are kind of
experiences I've had that have been

00:12:21.730 --> 00:12:21.740
experiences I've had that have been
 

00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:23.800
experiences I've had that have been
really striking for me now the talk is

00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:23.810
really striking for me now the talk is
 

00:12:23.810 --> 00:12:25.449
really striking for me now the talk is
about ethics in robotics so I have to

00:12:25.449 --> 00:12:25.459
about ethics in robotics so I have to
 

00:12:25.459 --> 00:12:27.160
about ethics in robotics so I have to
explain to you what I mean by that this

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:27.170
explain to you what I mean by that this
 

00:12:27.170 --> 00:12:28.360
explain to you what I mean by that this
is where I get to put on the philosophy

00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:28.370
is where I get to put on the philosophy
 

00:12:28.370 --> 00:12:30.970
is where I get to put on the philosophy

00:12:30.970 --> 00:12:30.980
head that I don't have right I have to
 

00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:32.769
head that I don't have right I have to
understand and and communicate to you

00:12:32.769 --> 00:12:32.779
understand and and communicate to you
 

00:12:32.779 --> 00:12:34.300

what I mean by ethics for the talk to

00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:34.310
what I mean by ethics for the talk to
 

00:12:34.310 --> 00:12:35.679
what I mean by ethics for the talk to
make sense and for what I'm the

make sense and for what I'm the
construction I'm going to show you to

00:12:36.610 --> 00:12:36.620
construction I'm going to show you to
 

00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:39.550
construction I'm going to show you to
make any sense so what do I mean by

00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:39.560
make any sense so what do I mean by
 

00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:41.379
make any sense so what do I mean by
ethics and ethics has many meanings and

00:12:41.379 --> 00:12:41.389
ethics and ethics has many meanings and
 

00:12:41.389 --> 00:12:45.129
ethics and ethics has many meanings and
you can go Wikipedia it all day when I

00:12:45.129 --> 00:12:45.139
you can go Wikipedia it all day when I
 

00:12:45.139 --> 00:12:46.840
you can go Wikipedia it all day when I
think about ethics when I analyze what

00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:46.850
think about ethics when I analyze what
 

00:12:46.850 --> 00:12:48.759
think about ethics when I analyze what
ethics means there are some routes that

00:12:48.759 --> 00:12:48.769
ethics means there are some routes that
 

00:12:48.769 --> 00:12:51.400
ethics means there are some routes that
it has on the Greek side that I think

00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:51.410
it has on the Greek side that I think
 

00:12:51.410 --> 00:12:52.360
it has on the Greek side that I think
make a lot of sense

00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:52.370
make a lot of sense
 

00:12:52.370 --> 00:12:55.360
make a lot of sense
one is ethos one is mores and I think

00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:55.370
one is ethos one is mores and I think
 

00:12:55.370 --> 00:12:56.799
one is ethos one is mores and I think
these relate actually to each other in a

00:12:56.799 --> 00:12:56.809
these relate actually to each other in a
 

00:12:56.809 --> 00:12:58.290
these relate actually to each other in a
really nice way okay

00:12:58.290 --> 00:12:58.300
really nice way okay
 

00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:01.689
really nice way okay
ethos is really about personal character

00:13:01.689 --> 00:13:01.699
ethos is really about personal character
 

00:13:01.699 --> 00:13:03.579
ethos is really about personal character
it's in a sense about the individual and

00:13:03.579 --> 00:13:03.589
it's in a sense about the individual and
 

00:13:03.589 --> 00:13:06.189
it's in a sense about the individual and
the make up of the individual it's about

00:13:06.189 --> 00:13:06.199
the make up of the individual it's about
 

00:13:06.199 --> 00:13:07.240
the make up of the individual it's about
what makes us who we are

00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:07.250
what makes us who we are
 

00:13:07.250 --> 00:13:11.980
what makes us who we are
okay mores is about custom and culture

00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:11.990
okay mores is about custom and culture
 

00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:14.829
okay mores is about custom and culture
and action it has to do with what we as

00:13:14.829 --> 00:13:14.839
and action it has to do with what we as
 

00:13:14.839 --> 00:13:17.530
and action it has to do with what we as
a society or a culture or a group behave

00:13:17.530 --> 00:13:17.540
a society or a culture or a group behave
 

00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:20.470
a society or a culture or a group behave
and what generates and constrains the

00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:20.480
and what generates and constrains the
 

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:22.100
and what generates and constrains the
kinds of behavior that we have

00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:22.110
kinds of behavior that we have
 

00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:24.230
kinds of behavior that we have
so the two words together are really

00:13:24.230 --> 00:13:24.240
so the two words together are really
 

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:26.390
so the two words together are really
interesting as roots of ethics because

00:13:26.390 --> 00:13:26.400
interesting as roots of ethics because
 

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:29.240
interesting as roots of ethics because
one of them is about the human and the

00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:29.250
one of them is about the human and the
 

00:13:29.250 --> 00:13:31.220
one of them is about the human and the
character that the human has and the

00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:31.230
character that the human has and the
 

00:13:31.230 --> 00:13:33.170
character that the human has and the
other is about action it's about doing

00:13:33.170 --> 00:13:33.180
other is about action it's about doing
 

00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:36.140
other is about action it's about doing
it's a verb in sense and when you

00:13:36.140 --> 00:13:36.150
it's a verb in sense and when you
 

00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:38.390
it's a verb in sense and when you
combine them the way I combine them

00:13:38.390 --> 00:13:38.400
combine them the way I combine them
 

00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:39.920
combine them the way I combine them
again I recombine them kind of in a

00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:39.930
again I recombine them kind of in a
 

00:13:39.930 --> 00:13:41.750
again I recombine them kind of in a
conglomerate way to try and say what

00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:41.760
conglomerate way to try and say what
 

00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:45.440
conglomerate way to try and say what
ethics means is the responsible conduct

00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:45.450
ethics means is the responsible conduct
 

00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:48.230
ethics means is the responsible conduct
of an individual so ethics is really

00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:48.240
of an individual so ethics is really
 

00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:50.480
of an individual so ethics is really
about the action that individual has and

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:50.490
about the action that individual has and
 

00:13:50.490 --> 00:13:53.120
about the action that individual has and
about how that conduct that the

00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:53.130
about how that conduct that the
 

00:13:53.130 --> 00:13:54.980
about how that conduct that the
individual has is responsible or not and

00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:54.990
individual has is responsible or not and
 

00:13:54.990 --> 00:13:57.740
individual has is responsible or not and
how one justifies to themself whether

00:13:57.740 --> 00:13:57.750
how one justifies to themself whether
 

00:13:57.750 --> 00:14:00.230
how one justifies to themself whether
what you're doing is responsible so this

00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:00.240
what you're doing is responsible so this
 

00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:01.700
what you're doing is responsible so this
is all a very long way of saying I'm not

00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:01.710
is all a very long way of saying I'm not
 

00:14:01.710 --> 00:14:03.020
is all a very long way of saying I'm not
going to talk about ethics and robotics

00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:03.030
going to talk about ethics and robotics
 

00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:06.050
going to talk about ethics and robotics
because robots don't have ethics and I'm

00:14:06.050 --> 00:14:06.060
because robots don't have ethics and I'm
 

00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:06.950
because robots don't have ethics and I'm
not a proponent of the singularity

00:14:06.950 --> 00:14:06.960
not a proponent of the singularity
 

00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:09.500
not a proponent of the singularity
concepts so no robots aren't going to

00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:09.510
concepts so no robots aren't going to
 

00:14:09.510 --> 00:14:11.300
concepts so no robots aren't going to
surpass humans and have ethics and

00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:11.310
surpass humans and have ethics and
 

00:14:11.310 --> 00:14:12.560
surpass humans and have ethics and
debate the ethics question the way we

00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:12.570
debate the ethics question the way we
 

00:14:12.570 --> 00:14:15.280
debate the ethics question the way we
are that's not going to happen right now

00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:15.290
are that's not going to happen right now
 

00:14:15.290 --> 00:14:17.840
are that's not going to happen right now
so actually we're not going to talk

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:17.850
so actually we're not going to talk
 

00:14:17.850 --> 00:14:19.310
so actually we're not going to talk
about robots we're going to talk about

00:14:19.310 --> 00:14:19.320
about robots we're going to talk about
 

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:21.410
about robots we're going to talk about
robot assists that's what ethics lives

00:14:21.410 --> 00:14:21.420
robot assists that's what ethics lives
 

00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:23.960
robot assists that's what ethics lives
and the interesting question isn't the

00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:23.970
and the interesting question isn't the
 

00:14:23.970 --> 00:14:25.610
and the interesting question isn't the
ethics of robotics the interesting

00:14:25.610 --> 00:14:25.620
ethics of robotics the interesting
 

00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:28.150
ethics of robotics the interesting
question is what is the ethical and

00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:28.160
question is what is the ethical and
 

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:31.070
question is what is the ethical and
personal responsibility nature of the

00:14:31.070 --> 00:14:31.080
personal responsibility nature of the
 

00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:32.900
personal responsibility nature of the
relationship robot assists have to each

00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:32.910
relationship robot assists have to each
 

00:14:32.910 --> 00:14:34.880
relationship robot assists have to each
other to the technology into the world

00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:34.890
other to the technology into the world
 

00:14:34.890 --> 00:14:36.410
other to the technology into the world
and that's the interesting question to

00:14:36.410 --> 00:14:36.420
and that's the interesting question to
 

00:14:36.420 --> 00:14:38.570
and that's the interesting question to
ask and try and answer so let's talk

00:14:38.570 --> 00:14:38.580
ask and try and answer so let's talk
 

00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:39.890
ask and try and answer so let's talk
about that right

00:14:39.890 --> 00:14:39.900
about that right
 

00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:43.610
about that right
Epic's of robot assists so the first

00:14:43.610 --> 00:14:43.620
Epic's of robot assists so the first
 

00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:45.590
Epic's of robot assists so the first
thing I did is I wanted to see what's

00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:45.600
thing I did is I wanted to see what's
 

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:48.020
thing I did is I wanted to see what's
published on this a bet is a great place

00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:48.030
published on this a bet is a great place
 

00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:49.550
published on this a bet is a great place
to go right let's go straight to the

00:14:49.550 --> 00:14:49.560
to go right let's go straight to the
 

00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:51.890
to go right let's go straight to the
accreditation board and see what

00:14:51.890 --> 00:14:51.900
accreditation board and see what
 

00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:54.560
accreditation board and see what
engineers as a kind of super set of

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:54.570
engineers as a kind of super set of
 

00:14:54.570 --> 00:14:56.150
engineers as a kind of super set of
robot assists have actually published in

00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:56.160
robot assists have actually published in
 

00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:58.940
robot assists have actually published in
the greed is important and you go to the

00:14:58.940 --> 00:14:58.950
the greed is important and you go to the
 

00:14:58.950 --> 00:15:02.210
the greed is important and you go to the
abet dialogue papers and there's a code

00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:02.220
abet dialogue papers and there's a code
 

00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:03.680
abet dialogue papers and there's a code
of ethics oh good there's a code of

00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:03.690
of ethics oh good there's a code of
 

00:15:03.690 --> 00:15:05.150
of ethics oh good there's a code of
ethics outstanding now let's go look at

00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:05.160
ethics outstanding now let's go look at
 

00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:07.130
ethics outstanding now let's go look at
the code of ethics right so you go and

00:15:07.130 --> 00:15:07.140
the code of ethics right so you go and
 

00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:08.150
the code of ethics right so you go and
open up the code of ethics there's a

00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:08.160
open up the code of ethics there's a
 

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:10.060
open up the code of ethics there's a
fundamental principles page the very top

00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:10.070
fundamental principles page the very top
 

00:15:10.070 --> 00:15:11.720
fundamental principles page the very top
outstanding and you can go look at this

00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:11.730
outstanding and you can go look at this
 

00:15:11.730 --> 00:15:13.460
outstanding and you can go look at this
up and you'll find us and the

00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:13.470
up and you'll find us and the
 

00:15:13.470 --> 00:15:15.440
up and you'll find us and the
fundamental principles are to uphold

00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:15.450
fundamental principles are to uphold
 

00:15:15.450 --> 00:15:16.760
fundamental principles are to uphold
advance the integrity honor the dignity

00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:16.770
advance the integrity honor the dignity
 

00:15:16.770 --> 00:15:18.500
advance the integrity honor the dignity
of engineering profession by and then

00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:18.510
of engineering profession by and then
 

00:15:18.510 --> 00:15:22.340
of engineering profession by and then
there's a list okay now I read this and

00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:22.350
there's a list okay now I read this and
 

00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:24.560
there's a list okay now I read this and
I honest-to-god expected that the list

00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:24.570
I honest-to-god expected that the list
 

00:15:24.570 --> 00:15:28.820
I honest-to-god expected that the list
had to do with safe engineering with

00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:28.830
had to do with safe engineering with
 

00:15:28.830 --> 00:15:30.470
had to do with safe engineering with
engineering that conforms to standards

00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:30.480
engineering that conforms to standards
 

00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:31.930
engineering that conforms to standards
with engineering things that don't break

00:15:31.930 --> 00:15:31.940
with engineering things that don't break
 

00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:34.760
with engineering things that don't break
right I was thinking like an engineer

00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:34.770
right I was thinking like an engineer
 

00:15:34.770 --> 00:15:35.570
right I was thinking like an engineer
like a technician

00:15:35.570 --> 00:15:35.580
like a technician
 

00:15:35.580 --> 00:15:37.519
like a technician
and I was expecting this to be about

00:15:37.519 --> 00:15:37.529
and I was expecting this to be about
 

00:15:37.529 --> 00:15:38.810
and I was expecting this to be about
being true to your engineering

00:15:38.810 --> 00:15:38.820
being true to your engineering
 

00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:42.800
being true to your engineering
profession but I was very happily

00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:42.810
profession but I was very happily
 

00:15:42.810 --> 00:15:44.180
profession but I was very happily
surprised to see that that's not the

00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:44.190
surprised to see that that's not the
 

00:15:44.190 --> 00:15:47.509
surprised to see that that's not the
case the first code that they have in

00:15:47.509 --> 00:15:47.519
case the first code that they have in
 

00:15:47.519 --> 00:15:49.940
case the first code that they have in
the Code of Ethics conduct in a bet is

00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:49.950
the Code of Ethics conduct in a bet is
 

00:15:49.950 --> 00:15:53.300
the Code of Ethics conduct in a bet is
this using their knowledge and skill for

this using their knowledge and skill for
 

00:15:53.310 --> 00:15:55.730
this using their knowledge and skill for
the enhancement of human welfare and the

00:15:55.730 --> 00:15:55.740
the enhancement of human welfare and the
 

00:15:55.740 --> 00:16:00.139
the enhancement of human welfare and the
environment this bowled me over I was

00:16:00.139 --> 00:16:00.149
environment this bowled me over I was
 

00:16:00.149 --> 00:16:03.350
environment this bowled me over I was
really surprised and impressed that the

00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:03.360
really surprised and impressed that the
 

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:05.120
really surprised and impressed that the
engineering profession has chosen as

00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:05.130
engineering profession has chosen as
 

00:16:05.130 --> 00:16:08.420
engineering profession has chosen as
number one on this list two things that

00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:08.430
number one on this list two things that
 

00:16:08.430 --> 00:16:12.290
number one on this list two things that
are highly humanistic may I say hard to

00:16:12.290 --> 00:16:12.300
are highly humanistic may I say hard to
 

00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:15.590
are highly humanistic may I say hard to
measure and not at all related to

00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:15.600
measure and not at all related to
 

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:17.780
measure and not at all related to
directly the execution of engineering

00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:17.790
directly the execution of engineering
 

00:16:17.790 --> 00:16:19.699
directly the execution of engineering
but related to much much larger issues

00:16:19.699 --> 00:16:19.709
but related to much much larger issues
 

00:16:19.709 --> 00:16:22.699
but related to much much larger issues
around conduct so I was blown away in a

00:16:22.699 --> 00:16:22.709
around conduct so I was blown away in a
 

00:16:22.709 --> 00:16:25.490
around conduct so I was blown away in a
very good way human welfare enhancing

00:16:25.490 --> 00:16:25.500
very good way human welfare enhancing
 

00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:28.480
very good way human welfare enhancing
human welfare I mean this is big stuff

and say oh there is a potential path

00:16:56.210 --> 00:16:56.220
and say oh there is a potential path
 

00:16:56.220 --> 00:16:57.710
and say oh there is a potential path
forward and so I have to show that to

00:16:57.710 --> 00:16:57.720
forward and so I have to show that to
 

00:16:57.720 --> 00:16:58.880
forward and so I have to show that to
you because I think that's a really nice

anti-personnel landmine thank you
 

00:17:24.209 --> 00:17:27.139
anti-personnel landmine thank you
so that's a mine and it's a scary thing

00:17:27.139 --> 00:17:27.149
so that's a mine and it's a scary thing
 

00:17:27.149 --> 00:17:29.090
so that's a mine and it's a scary thing
to see right it's almost it's almost

00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:29.100
to see right it's almost it's almost

puts hair on the back of my head every

00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:30.960
puts hair on the back of my head every
 

00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:31.879
puts hair on the back of my head every
time I look at a picture of a mine

00:17:31.879 --> 00:17:31.889
time I look at a picture of a mine
 

00:17:31.889 --> 00:17:33.739
time I look at a picture of a mine
because you know the potential that a

00:17:33.739 --> 00:17:33.749
because you know the potential that a
 

00:17:33.749 --> 00:17:34.999
because you know the potential that a
mine has and you know how I can really

00:17:34.999 --> 00:17:35.009
mine has and you know how I can really
 

00:17:35.009 --> 00:17:38.600
mine has and you know how I can really
change somebody's life so I had another

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:38.610
change somebody's life so I had another
 

00:17:38.610 --> 00:17:40.039
change somebody's life so I had another
colleague at Carnegie Mellon he's not

00:17:40.039 --> 00:17:40.049
colleague at Carnegie Mellon he's not
 

00:17:40.049 --> 00:17:41.480
colleague at Carnegie Mellon he's not
here any longer so this is even easier

00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:41.490
here any longer so this is even easier
 

00:17:41.490 --> 00:17:43.970
here any longer so this is even easier
this story to tell he worked for the

00:17:43.970 --> 00:17:43.980
this story to tell he worked for the
 

00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:46.070
this story to tell he worked for the
department defense on a mine except it

00:17:46.070 --> 00:17:46.080
department defense on a mine except it
 

00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:48.619
department defense on a mine except it
was a smart mind it was an anti-tank

00:17:48.619 --> 00:17:48.629
was a smart mind it was an anti-tank
 

00:17:48.629 --> 00:17:52.009
was a smart mind it was an anti-tank
smart mine that had the ability to move

00:17:52.009 --> 00:17:52.019
smart mine that had the ability to move
 

00:17:52.019 --> 00:17:54.680
smart mine that had the ability to move
it could actually jump around so the

00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:54.690
it could actually jump around so the
 

00:17:54.690 --> 00:17:56.680
it could actually jump around so the
project was build a mine that can hop

00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:56.690
project was build a mine that can hop
 

00:17:56.690 --> 00:17:58.970
project was build a mine that can hop
now why would you want a mine to hop

00:17:58.970 --> 00:17:58.980
now why would you want a mine to hop
 

00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:01.909
now why would you want a mine to hop
well there's two reasons one if a mine

00:18:01.909 --> 00:18:01.919
well there's two reasons one if a mine
 

00:18:01.919 --> 00:18:03.799
well there's two reasons one if a mine
can hop then when somebody's walking

00:18:03.799 --> 00:18:03.809
can hop then when somebody's walking
 

00:18:03.809 --> 00:18:06.080
can hop then when somebody's walking
around it'll hop out of their way so it

00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:06.090
around it'll hop out of their way so it
 

00:18:06.090 --> 00:18:07.399
around it'll hop out of their way so it
doesn't get wasted on a person because

00:18:07.399 --> 00:18:07.409
doesn't get wasted on a person because
 

00:18:07.409 --> 00:18:08.960
doesn't get wasted on a person because
this is protects it's supposed to blow

00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:08.970
this is protects it's supposed to blow
 

00:18:08.970 --> 00:18:12.169
this is protects it's supposed to blow
up a tank not a person second reason if

00:18:12.169 --> 00:18:12.179
up a tank not a person second reason if
 

00:18:12.179 --> 00:18:13.430
up a tank not a person second reason if
it could hop then if there's a tank over

00:18:13.430 --> 00:18:13.440
it could hop then if there's a tank over
 

00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:15.320
it could hop then if there's a tank over
there can hop into the tank blow up the

00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:15.330
there can hop into the tank blow up the
 

00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:17.779
there can hop into the tank blow up the
tank right and there's an interesting

00:18:17.779 --> 00:18:17.789
tank right and there's an interesting
 

00:18:17.789 --> 00:18:19.549
tank right and there's an interesting
extra reason right it's not really a

00:18:19.549 --> 00:18:19.559
extra reason right it's not really a
 

00:18:19.559 --> 00:18:22.009
extra reason right it's not really a
mine it's a robot now so anti landmine

00:18:22.009 --> 00:18:22.019
mine it's a robot now so anti landmine
 

00:18:22.019 --> 00:18:25.369
mine it's a robot now so anti landmine
treaties don't really apply now we got

00:18:25.369 --> 00:18:25.379
treaties don't really apply now we got
 

00:18:25.379 --> 00:18:26.810
treaties don't really apply now we got
into a debate talking about this

00:18:26.810 --> 00:18:26.820
into a debate talking about this
 

00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:28.700
into a debate talking about this
technology and talking about what he was

00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:28.710
technology and talking about what he was
 

00:18:28.710 --> 00:18:29.480
technology and talking about what he was
working out which was the hopping

00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:29.490
working out which was the hopping
 

00:18:29.490 --> 00:18:30.619
working out which was the hopping
mechanism and the decision

00:18:30.619 --> 00:18:30.629
mechanism and the decision
 

00:18:30.629 --> 00:18:32.989
mechanism and the decision
decision-making around that and his

00:18:32.989 --> 00:18:32.999
decision-making around that and his
 

00:18:32.999 --> 00:18:34.430
decision-making around that and his
point was I don't see how you can be

00:18:34.430 --> 00:18:34.440
point was I don't see how you can be
 

00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:36.100
point was I don't see how you can be
against a Selah this is gonna save lives

00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:36.110
against a Selah this is gonna save lives
 

00:18:36.110 --> 00:18:38.480
against a Selah this is gonna save lives
because it's gonna hop out of the way of

00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:38.490
because it's gonna hop out of the way of
 

00:18:38.490 --> 00:18:40.639
because it's gonna hop out of the way of
personnel and that means an infant

00:18:40.639 --> 00:18:40.649
personnel and that means an infant
 

00:18:40.649 --> 00:18:42.980
personnel and that means an infant
running will not get killed they won't

00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:42.990
running will not get killed they won't
 

00:18:42.990 --> 00:18:44.239
running will not get killed they won't
lose their leg because the mine will hop

00:18:44.239 --> 00:18:44.249
lose their leg because the mine will hop
 

00:18:44.249 --> 00:18:46.340
lose their leg because the mine will hop
out of their way and that's an entirely

00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:46.350
out of their way and that's an entirely
 

00:18:46.350 --> 00:18:48.560
out of their way and that's an entirely
valid point there's nothing wrong with

00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:48.570
valid point there's nothing wrong with
 

00:18:48.570 --> 00:18:51.879
valid point there's nothing wrong with
that statement what bothered me and

00:18:51.879 --> 00:18:51.889
that statement what bothered me and
 

00:18:51.889 --> 00:18:54.350
that statement what bothered me and
continues to bother me and makes me

00:18:54.350 --> 00:18:54.360
continues to bother me and makes me
 

00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:58.519
continues to bother me and makes me
wonder is how much to the systems level

00:18:58.519 --> 00:18:58.529
wonder is how much to the systems level
 

00:18:58.529 --> 00:19:00.289
wonder is how much to the systems level
is it the responsibility of the engineer

00:19:00.289 --> 00:19:00.299
is it the responsibility of the engineer
 

00:19:00.299 --> 00:19:02.899
is it the responsibility of the engineer
to think you can talk about a single

their my their life essentially being
 

00:19:07.619 --> 00:19:09.859
their my their life essentially being
saved by technology but do you have to

00:19:09.859 --> 00:19:09.869
saved by technology but do you have to
 

00:19:09.869 --> 00:19:11.539
saved by technology but do you have to
go higher than that do you have to also

00:19:11.539 --> 00:19:11.549
go higher than that do you have to also
 

00:19:11.549 --> 00:19:13.399
go higher than that do you have to also
consider how many of these are going to

00:19:13.399 --> 00:19:13.409
consider how many of these are going to
 

00:19:13.409 --> 00:19:15.980

exactly in the right reflective way so

00:26:57.110 --> 00:26:57.120
exactly in the right reflective way so
 

00:26:57.120 --> 00:26:58.310
exactly in the right reflective way so
that's one level that I think is really

00:26:58.310 --> 00:26:58.320
that's one level that I think is really
 

00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:01.310
that's one level that I think is really
important but we aren't actors in a

we're always acting in groups and so
there's another interesting question

00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:11.130
there's another interesting question

there's another interesting question
that I think is much harder to answer

00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:12.570
that I think is much harder to answer

think of it this way and I try all the
 

00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:40.010
think of it this way and I try all the
time to think about whether I'm being

okay now what can we do with it
what are the cool things we can do with

00:29:44.150 --> 00:29:44.160
what are the cool things we can do with
 

00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:46.159
what are the cool things we can do with
it but that's not how we function and

00:29:46.159 --> 00:29:46.169
it but that's not how we function and
 

00:29:46.169 --> 00:29:49.130
it but that's not how we function and
that's not how we got here okay and it's

00:29:49.130 --> 00:29:49.140
that's not how we got here okay and it's
 

00:29:49.140 --> 00:29:50.210
that's not how we got here okay and it's
interesting to show you through how we

00:29:50.210 --> 00:29:50.220
interesting to show you through how we
 

00:29:50.220 --> 00:29:52.070
interesting to show you through how we
got here we got here by asking the

00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:52.080
got here we got here by asking the
 

00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:54.110
got here we got here by asking the
question how can we foster a better

00:29:54.110 --> 00:29:54.120
question how can we foster a better
 

00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:55.640
question how can we foster a better
humanization between children in

00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:55.650
humanization between children in
 

00:29:55.650 --> 00:29:57.350
humanization between children in
different parts of the world how can we

00:29:57.350 --> 00:29:57.360
different parts of the world how can we
 

00:29:57.360 --> 00:30:00.530
different parts of the world how can we
cause cross-cultural understanding we

00:30:00.530 --> 00:30:00.540
cause cross-cultural understanding we
 

00:30:00.540 --> 00:30:02.360
cause cross-cultural understanding we
honest-to-god asked that question to

00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:02.370
honest-to-god asked that question to
 

00:30:02.370 --> 00:30:04.130
honest-to-god asked that question to
start with it's kind of funny right and

00:30:04.130 --> 00:30:04.140
start with it's kind of funny right and
 

00:30:04.140 --> 00:30:07.159
start with it's kind of funny right and
the answer in our minds was about the

00:30:07.159 --> 00:30:07.169
the answer in our minds was about the
 

00:30:07.169 --> 00:30:08.810
the answer in our minds was about the
power of the image what if you allow

00:30:08.810 --> 00:30:08.820
power of the image what if you allow
 

00:30:08.820 --> 00:30:11.150
power of the image what if you allow
people to do imaging in a way that's so

00:30:11.150 --> 00:30:11.160
people to do imaging in a way that's so
 

00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:11.980
people to do imaging in a way that's so
detailed that

fall into the image explore it find

00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:14.530
fall into the image explore it find
 

00:30:14.530 --> 00:30:16.540

conversation with people around the
 

00:30:17.630 --> 00:30:19.510

it with others so then we made the
 

00:30:28.429 --> 00:30:33.010

interesting about our society I'm
 

00:32:50.860 --> 00:32:52.990
interesting about our society I'm
getting there I want to have time for

00:32:52.990 --> 00:32:53.000
getting there I want to have time for
 

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:55.210
getting there I want to have time for
questions and conversations but one

00:32:55.210 --> 00:32:55.220
questions and conversations but one
 

00:32:55.220 --> 00:32:56.560
questions and conversations but one
thing that's really interesting is we're

thing that's really interesting is we're
 

00:32:56.570 --> 00:32:58.600
thing that's really interesting is we're
empowering people around the country to

00:32:58.600 --> 00:32:58.610
empowering people around the country to
 

00:32:58.610 --> 00:33:01.420
empowering people around the country to
be able to develop their own physical

00:33:01.420 --> 00:33:01.430
be able to develop their own physical
 

00:33:01.430 --> 00:33:03.100
be able to develop their own physical
embodied devices right we're making it

00:33:03.100 --> 00:33:03.110
embodied devices right we're making it
 

00:33:03.110 --> 00:33:04.600
embodied devices right we're making it
easier for people to build robots not

00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:04.610
easier for people to build robots not
 

00:33:04.610 --> 00:33:05.890
easier for people to build robots not
just here but all over the country and

00:33:05.890 --> 00:33:05.900
just here but all over the country and
 

00:33:05.900 --> 00:33:08.170
just here but all over the country and
that can be good and getting bad and

00:33:08.170 --> 00:33:08.180
that can be good and getting bad and

because it's interesting right
 

00:33:10.450 --> 00:33:12.370
because it's interesting right
technology empowerment doesn't mean you

00:33:12.370 --> 00:33:12.380
technology empowerment doesn't mean you
 

00:33:12.380 --> 00:33:14.890
technology empowerment doesn't mean you
just get lots of good devices here's an

00:33:14.890 --> 00:33:14.900
just get lots of good devices here's an
 

00:33:14.900 --> 00:33:16.120
just get lots of good devices here's an
interesting example anybody remember

money doing this if so we'll do it now
that's a weighty burden suddenly right

00:37:51.609 --> 00:37:51.619
that's a weighty burden suddenly right
 

00:37:51.619 --> 00:37:54.339
that's a weighty burden suddenly right
oh now I have to do it right but it's an

00:37:54.339 --> 00:37:54.349
oh now I have to do it right but it's an
 

00:37:54.349 --> 00:37:56.249
oh now I have to do it right but it's an
interesting burden because it's

00:37:56.249 --> 00:37:56.259
interesting burden because it's
 

00:37:56.259 --> 00:37:58.749
interesting burden because it's
propositioning that there are people who

00:37:58.749 --> 00:37:58.759
propositioning that there are people who
 

00:37:58.759 --> 00:38:01.269

actually want to act this way but don't
 

00:38:01.279 --> 00:38:02.819
actually want to act this way but don't
because they don't think it's practical

00:38:02.819 --> 00:38:02.829
because they don't think it's practical
 

00:38:02.829 --> 00:38:05.170
because they don't think it's practical
only practical considerations are

00:38:05.170 --> 00:38:05.180
only practical considerations are
 

00:38:05.180 --> 00:38:07.390

stopping them and Wow if that's true

00:38:07.390 --> 00:38:07.400
stopping them and Wow if that's true
 

00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:08.289
stopping them and Wow if that's true
that's fantastic

that's fantastic
 

00:38:08.299 --> 00:38:10.089
that's fantastic
because you've got minds you can change

because you've got minds you can change
 

00:38:10.099 --> 00:38:12.490
because you've got minds you can change
simply through action so I think that's

00:38:12.490 --> 00:38:12.500
simply through action so I think that's
 

00:38:12.500 --> 00:38:14.499
simply through action so I think that's
a really interesting result okay so if

00:38:14.499 --> 00:38:14.509
a really interesting result okay so if
 

00:38:14.509 --> 00:38:16.470
a really interesting result okay so if

you can ask two other questions in stop

00:38:18.789 --> 00:38:18.799
you can ask two other questions in stop
 

00:38:18.799 --> 00:38:20.859
you can ask two other questions in stop
one is what's the obligation of a

00:38:20.859 --> 00:38:20.869
one is what's the obligation of a
 

00:38:20.869 --> 00:38:22.359
one is what's the obligation of a
research group right if the obligation

00:38:22.359 --> 00:38:22.369
research group right if the obligation
 

00:38:22.369 --> 00:38:23.620
research group right if the obligation
of the individual is to think about all

00:38:23.620 --> 00:38:23.630
of the individual is to think about all
 

00:38:23.630 --> 00:38:26.230
of the individual is to think about all
these issues this is a research group

00:38:26.230 --> 00:38:26.240
these issues this is a research group
 

00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:27.430
these issues this is a research group
have an obligation if you're part of a

00:38:27.430 --> 00:38:27.440
have an obligation if you're part of a
 

00:38:27.440 --> 00:38:29.079
have an obligation if you're part of a
research group and I'm gonna claim I

research group and I'm gonna claim I
 

00:38:29.089 --> 00:38:32.829
research group and I'm gonna claim I
don't know but I think the obligation of

00:38:32.829 --> 00:38:32.839
don't know but I think the obligation of
 

00:38:32.839 --> 00:38:34.749
don't know but I think the obligation of
research group is actually in a way to

00:38:34.749 --> 00:38:34.759
research group is actually in a way to
 

00:38:34.759 --> 00:38:36.759
research group is actually in a way to
think about all of those issues at a

certain level of abstraction to think
about what that research group is doing

fast enough now that society as a whole

00:41:05.720 --> 00:41:05.730
fast enough now that society as a whole

fast enough now that society as a whole
is seeing the trend right maybe the

00:41:09.020 --> 00:41:09.030
is seeing the trend right maybe the
 

00:41:09.030 --> 00:41:10.340
is seeing the trend right maybe the
slope is high enough that people have

00:41:10.340 --> 00:41:10.350
slope is high enough that people have
 

00:41:10.350 --> 00:41:11.960
slope is high enough that people have
noticed it and maybe they're gonna pay

00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:11.970
noticed it and maybe they're gonna pay
 

00:41:11.970 --> 00:41:13.280
noticed it and maybe they're gonna pay
attention to it and and have some

00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:13.290
attention to it and and have some
 

00:41:13.290 --> 00:41:16.359
attention to it and and have some
dialogue around it that would be cool

00:41:16.359 --> 00:41:16.369
dialogue around it that would be cool
 

00:41:16.369 --> 00:41:18.849
dialogue around it that would be cool
well that's a hanging question I have no

00:41:18.849 --> 00:41:18.859
well that's a hanging question I have no
 

00:41:18.859 --> 00:41:21.190
well that's a hanging question I have no
real answer that was a maybe and that's

00:41:21.190 --> 00:41:21.200
real answer that was a maybe and that's
 

00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:23.349
real answer that was a maybe and that's
the end of my talk so I'd love to hear
