00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:17.390
So I'll thank Jaka for that lovely

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:19.619
introduction, and, and thank you for

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:22.080
sharing lunch, sharing your lunch hour

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:25.019
with me. So I think what I'm going to do

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:29.099
is kind of jump into the talk, and if

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:30.869
there are procedural questions you have

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.239
or questions about methods, I'm happy to

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:38.910
take those questions. Now otherwise

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:40.500
we'll just wait till the end. So lots of

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.170
tech companies are trying to figure out

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.930
how to detect emotion by reading facial

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:49.500
expressions. It's a really exciting time

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:52.649
because the technology is developing

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:55.620
really quickly, advancing really fast, and

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.210
in fact the pace is, even seems to me,

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:01.739
anyway, it's kind of speeding up and

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:04.280
there's a growing economy of emotion

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:07.140
reading gadgets and apps and algorithms.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:10.680
But the question I want to start today

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:14.010
with is: can we really expect a machine

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.439
to read emotion in a face? There are

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:20.490
plenty of companies who are claiming to

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:22.020
have already done it, and their claims

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.430
are based on some fundamental

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.240
assumptions that we're going to

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:29.579
systematically examine today. And I'll

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.380
just warn you, I'm going to maybe suggest

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.110
some things that some people might find

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:37.890
a little provocative and might challenge

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:40.790
your deeply-held beliefs, because the

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.170
message I'm going to suggest today is that

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:45.750
machines, it's not the case that machines

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.820
can't perceive emotion, but that

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.759
companies currently seem to be going

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.439
about this question in the wrong way,

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:54.360
because they fundamentally misunderstand

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:57.780
the nature of emotion. And as a

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:00.960
consequence, they're missing what I would

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:03.360
think of as a game-changing opportunity

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.600
to really transform the science and its

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.610
application to everyday problems. So

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.709
emotion-reading technology usually

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.470
starts with the assumption that people

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:15.720
are supposed to smile when they're happy,

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.940
frown when they're sad, scowl when

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.280
they're angry, and so on, and that

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:23.070
everyone around the world should be able

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:26.660
to recognize smiles and frowns and

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:29.370
scowls as expressions of emotion. And

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.230
it's this assumption that leads

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.620
companies to claim that detecting a

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.900
smile with computer vision algorithms is

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:40.350
equivalent to detecting an emotion like

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:47.610
joy. But I want you to consider this

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:51.990
evidence. Here on the x-axis are the

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:55.290
presumed expressions for the various

00:02:51.990 --> 00:03:00.450
emotions for anger, disgust, fear,

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:01.770
happiness, sadness, and surprise. And now

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.830
we're going to look at some evidence

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:07.200
from meta-analyses, statistical summaries

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:08.790
of experiments, to answer the question of

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:12.230
how often people actually make these

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:18.000
faces during emotion. And the answer is:

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:20.070
not so much. The y-axis represents the

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.250
proportion of times that people actually

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:26.760
make these facial expressions during

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:31.620
actual emotional events. So in real life,

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:35.880
for example, people only make a wide-eyed

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:37.140
gasping face during an episode of fear nine

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.630
percent of the time

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.580
across 16 different studies. And in fact,

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:44.820
that face, if you were in Papua New

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:46.680
Guinea in the Trobriand Islands, would be

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:48.120
considered an anger face. It's a threat

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:52.920
face. It's a face that you make to

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:55.019
threaten someone. So in real life, people

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.880
are moving their faces in a variety of

00:03:55.019 --> 00:04:01.739
ways to express a given emotion. They

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:05.400
might scowl in anger about 30 percent of

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:07.950
the time, but they might cry in anger.

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:11.150
They might have a stone-faced stare in

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:14.370
anger. They might even smile in anger. And

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:15.780
conversely, people often make these faces

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:19.979
when they're not emotional at all. For

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:21.180
example, people often scowl a full on

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:22.640
facial scowl when they're just

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:25.200
concentrating really hard.

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:26.380
Nevertheless, there are hundreds of

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:30.430
studies where

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:33.070
subjects are shown posed expressions

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:34.870
like these supposed faces and then

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:38.160
they're asked to identify the emotion

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:41.020
being portrayed. And again, the

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:42.490
proportions are on the y-axis and so you

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:44.260
can see there's quite a difference, right,

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:46.510
even though people only make a wide-eyed

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:51.070
gasping face about 9% of the time,

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:54.460
68% of the time, test subjects identify

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:55.470
that as a fear expression, and so on, and

00:04:54.460 --> 00:05:00.630
so forth.

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:05.520
So, which data are the companies using to,

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:09.370
to, as the basis of their development?

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:11.140
They're using the blue bars. So when

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:13.900
software detects someone is scowling,

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:17.530
they infer that the person is angry, and

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:19.780
in fact, you'll hear companies refer to a

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:22.140
scowl as an "anger expression" as if

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:26.650
there's a one-to-one correspondence, and

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:30.250
frowning for sadness, and so on. And so,

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:32.680
the question is, well, if people sometimes

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:35.650
make these faces to express emotions, the

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:39.520
the the presumed emotion, but often not.

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:42.390
Why are test subjects, as perceivers,

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:45.070
identifying emotions in these faces so

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:47.320
so frequently? So why are the blue bars so

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:49.990
much higher than the white bars? And now,

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:51.610
I'm going to show you the answer. Here's

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:53.890
the kind of experiment that is almost

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:55.720
always used in the sorts of studies that

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:58.450
generate the data for those blue bars.

00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:01.510
Test subjects are shown a posed face

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:02.740
like this, and then they're shown a

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:04.300
small set of words, and then they're

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:09.000
asked to pick the word that matches the

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:09.000
face. So, which word matches this face?

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:16.870
Good job. When test subjects choose the

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:20.590
expected word from the list, it's called

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:21.250
"accuracy" even though this person is not

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:23.560
angry.

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:25.840
In fact, she's just posing a face. And in

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:27.400
most of the faces that are used in these

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:29.350
experiments, subjects are just posing

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:31.780
faces, right. So it's not really

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:33.250
accuracy. It's more like how much did you

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:36.070
agree with the experimenter's

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:37.180
expectations. But it's called "accuracy," so

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:40.030
that's what we're going to call it today too.

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:42.840
So, hundreds of studies show

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:44.950
pretty high accuracy using this method.

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:47.230
This is on average, so this is a

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:51.730
meta-analytic average across hundreds of

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:54.400
studies. And emotion perception, you know,

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:56.680
feels as easy as reading words on a page,

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:59.110
because in fact, that's actually what's

00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:02.490
happening in these experiments. And when

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:06.300
you remove the words, and you merely ask

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:10.210
test subjects to freely label the faces,

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:12.940
accuracy drops precipitously. And for

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:15.610
some emotions like contempt and shame

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:17.920
and embarrassment, the rates actually

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:23.080
drop to chance levels, which is about

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:25.270
17% in most of these studies. And here's

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:28.180
what happens when we add a little bit of

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:31.450
diversity into the picture. So, things get

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:34.000
a little more interesting. So, we tested a

00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:38.140
group of hunter-gatherers in Tanzania

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:40.630
called the Hadza. The Hadza have been

00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:43.300
hunting and gathering continuously as a

00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:47.350
culture since the Pleistocene. They don't

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:49.960
live in, you know, the same, exact same

00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:52.090
circumstances as ancient humans, but they

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:54.310
are living, they are hunting and

00:07:52.090 --> 00:07:56.500
gathering on the African savannah, so

00:07:54.310 --> 00:08:00.060
they are living a lifestyle that is

00:07:56.500 --> 00:08:02.110
similar to the conditions that some

00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:05.020
psychologists, evolutionary psychologists,

00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:06.160
believe gave rise to these "universal"

00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:09.610
expressions. So they're a great

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:11.290
population to, to test. And they're

00:08:09.610 --> 00:08:12.760
actually aren't that many of them left.

00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:16.510
It's actually really hard to get access

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:17.590
to these, to this group of individuals.

00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:20.410
You have to have special research

00:08:17.590 --> 00:08:22.840
permits, and so on. So, we were able to,

00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:26.170
with the help of an anthropologist who

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:27.940
we collaborated with, get access to the

00:08:26.170 --> 00:08:31.840
Hadza, and who were very generous with

00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:33.700
their time and, you know, labeled some

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:35.950
faces for us. And we showed them a set of

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:40.080
faces, and we asked them to do exactly

00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:44.560
what we asked other test subjects to do,

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:47.110
and accuracy actually dropped even

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:50.320
further. And this number is actually a

00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:52.060
little high, because what the Hadza were

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:53.980
very good at doing was distinguishing a

00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:57.370
smile from

00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:59.860
all the other faces which were depicting

00:08:57.370 --> 00:09:03.820
negative emotions. So when you just look

00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:06.130
at the accuracy for, for labeling scowls

00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:09.220
and pouts and things like that, just the

00:09:06.130 --> 00:09:11.980
negative depictions of negative emotions,

00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:14.740
the rate dropped even further, pretty

00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:18.820
much to to chance levels. And so, this is

00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:21.370
what happens when you remove the secret

00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:23.290
ingredient from these experiments: the

00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:26.649
evidence for universal emotional

00:09:23.290 --> 00:09:28.959
expressions vanishes. Now, I'm not saying

00:09:26.649 --> 00:09:30.579
that that means that faces carry no

00:09:28.959 --> 00:09:32.709
information, or that we can't look at a

00:09:30.579 --> 00:09:36.760
face and and make a reasonable guess

00:09:32.709 --> 00:09:38.740
about how someone feels. But what I am

00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:40.389
telling you is that human brains are

00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:43.149
doing more than just looking at a face

00:09:40.389 --> 00:09:44.740
when they make such judgments. That is,

00:09:43.149 --> 00:09:46.329
right now, when you're looking at me, or

00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:48.220
when I'm looking at you, some of you are

00:09:46.329 --> 00:09:50.709
smiling and nodding - thank you very much.

00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:52.149
Others are, you know, maybe looking a

00:09:50.709 --> 00:09:54.940
little more skeptical, or at least that's

00:09:52.149 --> 00:09:57.040
the guess that my brain is making, and my

00:09:54.940 --> 00:10:00.370
brain isn't just using your face. There's

00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:02.709
a whole context around us. But in these

00:10:00.370 --> 00:10:04.839
experiments, we're just looking,

00:10:02.709 --> 00:10:06.970
the, the experimenters were looking only

00:10:04.839 --> 00:10:09.490
for the signal value in the face alone,

00:10:06.970 --> 00:10:11.589
stripped away of all context; except the

00:10:09.490 --> 00:10:13.569
context that they, unbeknownst to them,

00:10:11.589 --> 00:10:17.139
actually had provided to the subjects,

00:10:13.569 --> 00:10:22.810
which are the words. So - just to confirm

00:10:17.139 --> 00:10:27.490
that, you know, the experimental

00:10:22.810 --> 00:10:30.310
context was actually generating evidence,

00:10:27.490 --> 00:10:33.790
making, making, that it could make ANY

00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:35.589
emotion look universal, we decided to

00:10:33.790 --> 00:10:38.470
test this by going back to the original

00:10:35.589 --> 00:10:40.540
experimental method. And we identified

00:10:38.470 --> 00:10:42.880
six emotions from different cultures

00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:45.970
that have never been identified as

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:49.029
universal, that can't be translated into

00:10:45.970 --> 00:10:50.769
English with a single word, which is

00:10:49.029 --> 00:10:53.980
important because all of the presumed

00:10:50.769 --> 00:10:57.940
universal emotions happen to be English

00:10:53.980 --> 00:11:00.430
categories, and they also don't exist in

00:10:57.940 --> 00:11:04.089
the language that is spoken by the Hadza,

00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:07.210
which is Hadzane. And then, what

00:11:04.089 --> 00:11:09.930
we did is we invented expressions

00:11:07.210 --> 00:11:12.810
for these emotions - we just made them up

00:11:09.930 --> 00:11:14.860
- and in this case, we were using

00:11:12.810 --> 00:11:16.180
vocalizations, although we have a version

00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:18.430
with faces. But we were using

00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:20.860
vocalizations because, it's a complicated

00:11:18.430 --> 00:11:24.100
story, but we were basically replicating,

00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:27.580
we were replicating another experiment

00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:30.070
and kind of criticizing it. So we used

00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:34.810
vocalizations. So for example, the

00:11:30.070 --> 00:11:37.570
category Gigil is the overwhelming urge

00:11:34.810 --> 00:11:38.710
to squeeze or pinch something that's

00:11:37.570 --> 00:11:40.060
very cute; you know, when you see something

00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:42.340
cute and you just want to, you just want

00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:46.480
to, you know, squeeze the cheeks of a baby,

00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:49.270
right. That's the, that's the emotion. And

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:53.160
so, we made up a vocalization to go with

00:11:49.270 --> 00:11:53.160
that, which sounds something like this: eee!

00:11:54.360 --> 00:12:02.290
OK, so, we made that sound, and then we

00:11:59.530 --> 00:12:04.660
asked our test subjects again from the

00:12:02.290 --> 00:12:06.880
Hadza test subjects to match each

00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:10.590
sound with a little story that we told

00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:14.590
about emotion, because in remote samples

00:12:10.590 --> 00:12:16.630
that are, you know, small-scale societies

00:12:14.590 --> 00:12:19.450
that are very remote from Western

00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:20.830
cultures, typically the way these

00:12:19.450 --> 00:12:22.000
experiments are done is you don't give

00:12:20.830 --> 00:12:24.130
them a list of words. You tell them a

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.230
little story about the emotion that

00:12:24.130 --> 00:12:28.330
contains the emotion word, and then you

00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:30.160
give them two faces or two vocalizations

00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:33.310
and you ask them to basically pick the

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:36.460
expression that matches. So, that's what

00:12:33.310 --> 00:12:40.870
we did. And then the average accuracy

00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:43.720
actually was pretty high. And if you look

00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:46.930
at the individual emotions, five of the

00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:48.490
six of them look universal. And in fact,

00:12:46.930 --> 00:12:51.130
these accuracy rates are pretty similar

00:12:48.490 --> 00:12:53.580
to what you see in many studies of anger,

00:12:51.130 --> 00:12:57.280
for anger, sadness, fear, and so on.

00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:59.770
So this is where the blue bars come from.

00:12:57.280 --> 00:13:02.560
Scientists have been using, really since

00:12:59.770 --> 00:13:04.720
the 1960s, an experimental method that

00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:06.850
doesn't discover evidence for universal

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:11.050
expressions of emotion, but it

00:13:06.850 --> 00:13:14.730
manufactures that evidence. This method

00:13:11.050 --> 00:13:18.700
of providing test subjects with

00:13:14.730 --> 00:13:21.100
linguistic cues is responsible for the

00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:24.130
scientific belief that a scowl

00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:26.530
expresses anger and only anger, that a

00:13:24.130 --> 00:13:29.950
smile expresses happiness and only

00:13:26.530 --> 00:13:33.490
happiness, and so on. And so, if you're a

00:13:29.950 --> 00:13:36.940
company who wants to build AI to

00:13:33.490 --> 00:13:40.330
perceive emotions in humans by measuring

00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:43.300
their facial movements, then it's

00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:45.930
probably important to realize that these

00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:49.390
famous configurations don't actually

00:13:45.930 --> 00:13:52.270
consistently display disgust, anger, and

00:13:49.390 --> 00:13:56.460
fear, and so on, and that it's a mistake

00:13:52.270 --> 00:13:59.170
to infer that someone who is scowling is

00:13:56.460 --> 00:14:01.450
angry. And in fact, it's a, it's a mistake

00:13:59.170 --> 00:14:04.660
to call a scowl an "anger expression,"

00:14:01.450 --> 00:14:08.470
because only sometimes does a, is

00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:11.110
a scowl indicative of anger. Instead, what

00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:14.650
we see when we look at the data is that

00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:17.950
variation is the norm. And to show, I'll

00:14:14.650 --> 00:14:21.970
just show you what I mean. So, if you were

00:14:17.950 --> 00:14:23.890
looking at this person's face, how, how

00:14:21.970 --> 00:14:26.400
does she look to you? What, what emotion

00:14:23.890 --> 00:14:29.050
does she seem to be expressing? Sadness.

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:35.740
She's sneezing (not even an emotion at

00:14:29.050 --> 00:14:37.330
all). Smelling something good. So usually,

00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:42.730
this is it, yep, usually people see her as

00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:45.300
tired, or, or as grieving, or as about to

00:14:42.730 --> 00:14:49.110
cry, sad.

00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:51.910
Actually, this is my daughter Sophia

00:14:49.110 --> 00:14:54.640
experiencing what I can only

00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:58.390
describe to you as a profound and deep

00:14:54.640 --> 00:15:02.680
sense of pleasure, at the chocolate

00:14:58.390 --> 00:15:07.180
Museum in Cologne. Germany. And this

00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:10.240
little sweetheart is also experiencing a

00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:12.940
profound sense of pleasure. And the

00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:15.150
lesson here is that people move their

00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:21.730
faces in many different ways

00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:24.270
during the same emotion. Now, if we were

00:15:21.730 --> 00:15:27.190
to only look at this little guy's

00:15:24.270 --> 00:15:31.780
eyebrows up to his, you know, eyes and

00:15:27.190 --> 00:15:34.510
nose, this, these facial actions actually

00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:38.200
are very reminiscent of

00:15:34.510 --> 00:15:46.060
the presumed expression for anger. So for

00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:48.600
example, this face is often seen as angry.

00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:53.140
Does anybody actually know who this is?

00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:55.620
Jim Webb. This is actually Jim Webb when

00:15:53.140 --> 00:15:58.390
he won the senatorial race in Virginia,

00:15:55.620 --> 00:16:02.290
which returned the Senate to Democratic

00:15:58.390 --> 00:16:03.910
control. This victory returned the Senate

00:16:02.290 --> 00:16:06.220
to democratic control. Sorry, I was just

00:16:03.910 --> 00:16:08.890
having a moment there. And so, without

00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:11.520
context, we see his face as communicating

00:16:08.890 --> 00:16:14.680
anger because actually this face

00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:17.080
symbolizes anger in our culture. So

00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:19.450
people don't just move their faces in

00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:22.630
different ways during the same emotion,

00:16:19.450 --> 00:16:28.240
they also move their faces in the same

00:16:22.630 --> 00:16:31.150
way during different emotions. So in

00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:33.220
real life, a face doesn't speak for

00:16:31.150 --> 00:16:35.800
itself, when it comes to emotion, right.

00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:38.430
People usually see this guy, this

00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:42.340
face as smug or pride or confidence.

00:16:38.430 --> 00:16:44.620
Actually it's the, the supposed

00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:46.240
universal expression for disgust. And

00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:49.170
what's really interesting is that when

00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:53.140
you stick the presumed, you know, the presumed

00:16:49.170 --> 00:16:57.100
expression for disgust on a body, or in

00:16:53.140 --> 00:17:01.020
any kind of context that suggests a

00:16:57.100 --> 00:17:03.250
different emotion, perceivers actually

00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:05.230
track the face differently. Their

00:17:03.250 --> 00:17:06.820
scanning of the face has a completely

00:17:05.230 --> 00:17:08.920
different pattern, suggesting they're

00:17:06.820 --> 00:17:12.520
making different meaning of that face on

00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:14.020
the, by virtue of the, the context. It's,

00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:17.260
and I'll just tell you as an aside, in

00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:20.800
every - maybe this an exaggeration - in most

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:24.310
studies where you pit a face against the

00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:26.650
context, the face always loses. Faces are

00:17:24.310 --> 00:17:30.430
inherently ambiguous without context to

00:17:26.650 --> 00:17:32.470
make them meaningful. So, what's up with

00:17:30.430 --> 00:17:34.210
these expressions? Where did they come

00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:36.610
from? Well, it turns out that they were

00:17:34.210 --> 00:17:39.400
not discovered by actually observing

00:17:36.610 --> 00:17:42.160
people as they moved their faces

00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:44.920
expressing emotions in real life. In fact,

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:47.560
these are stipulated expressions. So, a

00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:48.160
handful of scientists just anointed

00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:51.010
these as

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:52.660
the expressions of emotion, as universal

00:17:51.010 --> 00:17:55.420
truths, and then people built a whole

00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:58.840
science around it. So basically, they're

00:17:55.420 --> 00:18:01.780
stereotypes. And what we have is a

00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:03.420
science of stereotypes, or, you know,

00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:05.620
emojis,

00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:08.970
which by themselves, I should tell you,

00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:13.780
also are highly ambiguous, it turns out,

00:18:08.970 --> 00:18:17.110
without context. So obviously, we don't

00:18:13.780 --> 00:18:19.300
want to build a science of artificial

00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:21.220
intelligence on stereotypes. We want to

00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:24.040
build them on emotional episodes as they

00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:28.120
occur in in real life. And in real life,

00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:31.660
an emotion is not an entity, right. It's a

00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:34.360
category that's filled with variety. When

00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:37.540
you're angry, your face does many things,

00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:39.310
and your body does many things, and it

00:18:37.540 --> 00:18:41.290
turns out your brain also does different

00:18:39.310 --> 00:18:43.870
things depending on on the context that

00:18:41.290 --> 00:18:46.060
you're in. Now, for those of you who build

00:18:43.870 --> 00:18:48.940
classification systems, you know about

00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:51.250
categories, right? So for example, if you

00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:53.590
were building a category of, you're

00:18:51.250 --> 00:18:56.260
building a recognition system for cats, a

00:18:53.590 --> 00:18:57.940
cat recognition system, you would develop

00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:59.800
a classifier that could learn the

00:18:57.940 --> 00:19:01.840
features that cats have in common that

00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:05.080
distinguish them from other animals, like

00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:09.340
dogs and birds and fish and so on. And

00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:12.310
this CAT-egory... get it? My daughter made

00:19:09.340 --> 00:19:13.360
me say that, OK? This category (Thank you

00:19:12.310 --> 00:19:15.790
for laughing - now I can tell her that

00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:17.470
you thought it was funny.) is a

00:19:15.790 --> 00:19:19.960
collection of instances that have similar

00:19:17.470 --> 00:19:23.410
features. But, you know, there's actually

00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:25.990
plenty of variation in the instances

00:19:23.410 --> 00:19:33.580
of this category, too, right? Some cats are

00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:36.060
big, some cats are small, some cats have,

00:19:33.580 --> 00:19:39.250
you know, cats have different eye colors,

00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:44.920
some cats have long fur, some have short

00:19:39.250 --> 00:19:48.790
fur, some have no fur. But the human brain

00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:52.150
tends to ignore this variation in favor

00:19:48.790 --> 00:19:55.810
of what cats have in common. And the

00:19:52.150 --> 00:19:58.720
interesting thing is that humans also

00:19:55.810 --> 00:20:01.410
have the capacity to make other kinds of

00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:04.500
categories. Categories where

00:20:01.410 --> 00:20:06.450
there are no physical similarities. Where

00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:09.690
the category is not based on physical

00:20:06.450 --> 00:20:11.400
similarities of the instances. And this

00:20:09.690 --> 00:20:13.710
is something we do all the time. For

00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:15.900
example, here's a category. This is a

00:20:13.710 --> 00:20:20.130
category that every I'm sure everyone in

00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:24.930
this room knows. You want to take a guess

00:20:20.130 --> 00:20:26.580
what it is? Human-made objects? I suppose

00:20:24.930 --> 00:20:28.350
if you treat the elephant like a picture

00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:32.040
of an elephant, then that would, that

00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:35.160
would be true, yeah. OK, well, these are

00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:40.320
all objects that you can't bring through

00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:42.150
airport security. Actually, the last time

00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:45.540
I did this, one clever person actually

00:20:42.150 --> 00:20:48.180
said they're all instances of things

00:20:45.540 --> 00:20:49.830
that you can squirt water out of. And I

00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:52.290
thought, well, actually, yeah, if you think

00:20:49.830 --> 00:20:56.640
of the gun as a water pistol, then that

00:20:52.290 --> 00:20:58.980
that could work, right? This is a category

00:20:56.640 --> 00:21:01.320
that's not made of instances that share

00:20:58.980 --> 00:21:03.870
physical features. Instead, they share a

00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:05.610
common function, in this case, squirting

00:21:03.870 --> 00:21:09.570
water through them, or not being able to

00:21:05.610 --> 00:21:12.150
take them through airport security. This

00:21:09.570 --> 00:21:15.210
category, though, exists inside our heads

00:21:12.150 --> 00:21:17.880
and in the head of every adult who has

00:21:15.210 --> 00:21:21.810
ever flown on an airplane. It's a

00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:24.840
category of social reality. So, for

00:21:21.810 --> 00:21:27.180
objects to belong to this category, they

00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:29.520
they belong not because they all share

00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:32.190
the same physical features, but because

00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:34.980
we impose a similar function on them by

00:21:32.190 --> 00:21:39.590
collective agreement. We've all agreed

00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:42.330
that it is not OK to take water

00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:45.870
through the, you know, a water bottle

00:21:42.330 --> 00:21:49.230
through security, or a gun, or an

00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:52.200
elephant. And in fact, it turns out that

00:21:49.230 --> 00:21:56.520
most of the categories that we deal with

00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:58.680
in civilization are categories of social

00:21:56.520 --> 00:22:00.690
reality, whose instances don't

00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:03.090
necessarily share physical features, but

00:22:00.690 --> 00:22:06.210
we've imposed the same function on those

00:22:03.090 --> 00:22:08.880
features by collective agreement. Can you,

00:22:06.210 --> 00:22:11.240
can you think of any that might come to

00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:13.920
mind? Things that we treat as similar but

00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:15.059
but are actually, their physical features

00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:21.480
actually vary quite a

00:22:15.059 --> 00:22:23.820
bit? Money. Exactly. Money is, money is a

00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:26.159
great example. So, throughout the course

00:22:23.820 --> 00:22:29.580
of human history, and actually even right

00:22:26.159 --> 00:22:33.019
now, there's nothing about what humans

00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:35.279
have used as currency that defines those

00:22:33.019 --> 00:22:36.779
instances as currency. It's just that a

00:22:35.279 --> 00:22:39.480
group of people decide that something

00:22:36.779 --> 00:22:42.299
can be traded for material goods, and so

00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:47.039
they can. And, you know, little pieces of

00:22:42.299 --> 00:22:49.879
paper, pieces of plastic, shells, salt, big

00:22:47.039 --> 00:22:54.119
rocks in the ocean which are immovable,

00:22:49.879 --> 00:22:57.450
mortgages. And when we remove our

00:22:54.119 --> 00:22:59.940
collective agreement, those things lose

00:22:57.450 --> 00:23:02.779
their value, right? So one way of thinking

00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:05.039
about the, the mortgage bubble is that

00:23:02.779 --> 00:23:07.830
mortgages, the value of mortgages is

00:23:05.039 --> 00:23:10.740
based on collective agreement, and some

00:23:07.830 --> 00:23:17.129
people removed their agreement. Anything

00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:20.369
else? Yeah, that's true, you have to work

00:23:17.129 --> 00:23:23.369
really hard to accept the collective

00:23:20.369 --> 00:23:28.470
agreement of driving on the wrong side

00:23:23.369 --> 00:23:33.149
of the road. Oh, come on. Beauty.

00:23:28.470 --> 00:23:37.379
How about citizenship of a country? How

00:23:33.149 --> 00:23:42.049
about a country, right? If you go, for

00:23:37.379 --> 00:23:45.840
example, into, if you look at a map from the

00:23:42.049 --> 00:23:48.659
1940s or before the 1940s, the map of the

00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:50.460
world looks very different. The map of

00:23:48.659 --> 00:23:52.110
the earth is pretty much the same. The

00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:55.860
physical features of the earth are more

00:23:52.110 --> 00:23:59.639
or less the same, but, but the countries

00:23:55.860 --> 00:24:00.990
are that are drawn are different. So we

00:23:59.639 --> 00:24:04.529
could go on and on like this. We could

00:24:00.990 --> 00:24:07.289
talk about social rules, like being

00:24:04.529 --> 00:24:10.409
married. Marriage, it actually turns out, is

00:24:07.289 --> 00:24:13.980
also a category of social reality. The

00:24:10.409 --> 00:24:16.440
presidency of any country is, you know,

00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:18.389
people don't have power because they're

00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:20.249
endowed by nature with power. They have

00:24:18.389 --> 00:24:22.710
power because we all agree that certain

00:24:20.249 --> 00:24:25.139
positions give you power. And if we

00:24:22.710 --> 00:24:27.950
revoked our agreement, then they wouldn't

00:24:25.139 --> 00:24:34.670
have power anymore.

00:24:27.950 --> 00:24:39.290
That's called a revolution. So,

00:24:34.670 --> 00:24:41.630
emotion categories are categories like

00:24:39.290 --> 00:24:48.650
this. Anger and sadness and fear and so

00:24:41.630 --> 00:24:51.260
on are categories that exist because

00:24:48.650 --> 00:24:54.770
of collective agreement, just in the same

00:24:51.260 --> 00:24:57.530
way that we had to impose a function on

00:24:54.770 --> 00:25:00.650
the elephant that, that wasn't there

00:24:57.530 --> 00:25:06.440
before, in order for it to belong to

00:25:00.650 --> 00:25:10.040
this category. We also impose meaning on

00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:13.910
a downturned mouth, a scowl. We impose

00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:16.850
meaning on that scowl as anger, right. So

00:25:13.910 --> 00:25:20.360
a scowl isn't inherently meaningful as

00:25:16.850 --> 00:25:23.000
anger. In this culture, we've learned to

00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:26.540
impose that meaning based on our shared

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:28.100
knowledge of anger. And in the Trobriand

00:25:26.540 --> 00:25:31.630
Islands, they would impose a different

00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:35.090
meaning they impose a meaning of,

00:25:31.630 --> 00:25:36.860
sorry, uh, they impose a meaning on a

00:25:35.090 --> 00:25:38.620
different face for anger, for the

00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:43.010
stereotype of anger. It's a wide-eyed

00:25:38.620 --> 00:25:44.930
face, a wide-eyed gasping face. And this

00:25:43.010 --> 00:25:48.170
is also what allows us to see other

00:25:44.930 --> 00:25:50.300
expressive movements as anger, right? So

00:25:48.170 --> 00:25:52.910
what we're doing is imposing meaning on

00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:56.000
a smile or on a stone-faced stare, or on a

00:25:52.910 --> 00:25:59.390
cry as anger in a particular situation.

00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:01.550
It transforms mere physical movements

00:25:59.390 --> 00:26:04.280
into something much more meaningful,

00:26:01.550 --> 00:26:08.770
which allows us to predict what's going

00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:14.240
to happen next. So, if you want a machine

00:26:08.770 --> 00:26:18.200
to perceive emotions in a human, then it

00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:21.050
has to learn to construct categories on

00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:22.910
the fly. Perceiving emotions is not a

00:26:21.050 --> 00:26:26.270
clustering problem - it's a category

00:26:22.910 --> 00:26:28.010
construction problem. And it's a category

00:26:26.270 --> 00:26:30.380
construction problem whether you're

00:26:28.010 --> 00:26:33.110
measuring facial movements, or bodily

00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:35.410
movements, or the acoustics of someone's

00:26:33.110 --> 00:26:37.640
voice, or whether you're measuring the

00:26:35.410 --> 00:26:40.010
changes in their autonomic nervous

00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:42.110
system, or even in

00:26:40.010 --> 00:26:43.760
the neural activity of the brain, or even

00:26:42.110 --> 00:26:46.220
all of those, right? All of these things

00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:50.120
are physical changes that aren't

00:26:46.220 --> 00:26:52.910
inherently meaningful as emotions.

00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:56.060
Someone or something has to impose

00:26:52.910 --> 00:26:58.130
meaning on them to make them meaningful,

00:26:56.060 --> 00:27:01.010
right? So an increase in heart rate is

00:26:58.130 --> 00:27:04.610
not inherently fear, but it can become

00:27:01.010 --> 00:27:07.490
fear when it is, um, it's pressed into

00:27:04.610 --> 00:27:11.540
service to serve a particular function

00:27:07.490 --> 00:27:13.580
in a particular situation. So, emotions

00:27:11.540 --> 00:27:17.630
are not built into your brain from birth.

00:27:13.580 --> 00:27:20.540
They are just built, as you need them.

00:27:17.630 --> 00:27:23.270
And this is really hard to understand

00:27:20.540 --> 00:27:25.760
intuitively since, you know, your brain

00:27:23.270 --> 00:27:28.310
categorizes very automatically and very

00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:32.450
effortlessly without your awareness. And

00:27:28.310 --> 00:27:36.700
so, we need special examples to kind of

00:27:32.450 --> 00:27:40.600
reveal to us what our brains are doing,

00:27:36.700 --> 00:27:45.470
kind of categorizing very continuously

00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:47.000
and, and effortlessly. And so, what I'd

00:27:45.470 --> 00:27:48.530
like you to do right now is, we're going

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:53.030
to go through one of these examples, so I

00:27:48.530 --> 00:27:57.650
can, I can explain it to you. So, here's a

00:27:53.030 --> 00:28:01.760
bunch of black and white blobs. Tell me

00:27:57.650 --> 00:28:07.150
what you see. Sorry, a person? A person

00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:20.240
kicking a soccer ball. Mm-hmm. An octopus.

00:28:07.150 --> 00:28:23.900
One-eyed octopus. So, right now, what's

00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:25.880
happening in each of your brains is that

00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:28.370
billions of your neurons are working

00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:30.020
together to try to make sense of this, so

00:28:28.370 --> 00:28:32.240
that you see something other than black

00:28:30.020 --> 00:28:34.130
and white blobs. And what your brain is

00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:37.610
actually doing is it's searching through

00:28:34.130 --> 00:28:39.740
a lifetime of past experience, issuing

00:28:37.610 --> 00:28:41.990
thousands of guesses at the same time,

00:28:39.740 --> 00:28:44.450
weighing the probabilities, trying to

00:28:41.990 --> 00:28:47.200
answer the question, "what is this like?"

00:28:44.450 --> 00:28:51.730
Not "what is this?" but "what is this like?"

00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:53.960
"How similar is this to past experiences?"

00:28:51.730 --> 00:28:58.159
And this is all happening

00:28:53.960 --> 00:29:01.309
in the blink of an eye. Now, if you are

00:28:58.159 --> 00:29:03.289
seeing merely black and white blobs, then

00:29:01.309 --> 00:29:05.299
your brain hasn't found a good match, and

00:29:03.289 --> 00:29:09.590
you're in a state that scientists call

00:29:05.299 --> 00:29:11.809
experiential blindness. So now I'm gonna

00:29:09.590 --> 00:29:13.759
cure you of your experiential

00:29:11.809 --> 00:29:23.200
blindness. This is always my favorite

00:29:13.759 --> 00:29:23.200
part of any talk. Should I do that again?

00:29:24.879 --> 00:29:31.399
Now many of you see a bee. And the reason

00:29:29.419 --> 00:29:33.379
why is that now, as your brain is

00:29:31.399 --> 00:29:35.240
searching through past experiences,

00:29:33.379 --> 00:29:37.039
there's new knowledge there from the

00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:39.350
color photograph that you just saw. And

00:29:37.039 --> 00:29:42.159
the really cool thing is that what you

00:29:39.350 --> 00:29:45.409
just saw a moment or two ago, that

00:29:42.159 --> 00:29:49.220
knowledge is actually changing how you

00:29:45.409 --> 00:29:51.950
experience these blobs right now. So your

00:29:49.220 --> 00:29:55.850
brain is now categorizing this visual

00:29:51.950 --> 00:29:59.029
input as a member of the category "Bee." And

00:29:55.850 --> 00:30:01.639
as a result, your brain is filling in

00:29:59.029 --> 00:30:03.499
lines where there are no lines. It's

00:30:01.639 --> 00:30:07.009
actually changing the firing of its own

00:30:03.499 --> 00:30:09.919
neurons so that you see a bee where there

00:30:07.009 --> 00:30:12.649
is actually no bee present. This kind of

00:30:09.919 --> 00:30:14.419
category-induced hallucination is pretty

00:30:12.649 --> 00:30:16.340
much business as usual for your brain.

00:30:14.419 --> 00:30:18.110
This is just how your brain works. And

00:30:16.340 --> 00:30:21.850
your brain also constructs emotions

00:30:18.110 --> 00:30:25.190
in exactly this way. And here's why,

00:30:21.850 --> 00:30:28.340
here's why it happens. Because your brain

00:30:25.190 --> 00:30:32.149
is actually entombed in a dark silent

00:30:28.340 --> 00:30:34.940
box, called your skull, and it has to

00:30:32.149 --> 00:30:37.909
learn what is going on around it in the

00:30:34.940 --> 00:30:40.669
world via scraps of information that it

00:30:37.909 --> 00:30:44.659
gets through the sensory channels of the

00:30:40.669 --> 00:30:48.440
body. Now, the brain is trying to figure

00:30:44.659 --> 00:30:50.450
out the causes of these sensations, so

00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:52.399
that it understands what they mean and

00:30:50.450 --> 00:30:54.499
it knows what to do about them to keep

00:30:52.399 --> 00:30:56.119
you alive and well. And the problem is

00:30:54.499 --> 00:30:58.490
that the sensory information from the

00:30:56.119 --> 00:31:00.679
world is noisy. Ambiguous. It's often

00:30:58.490 --> 00:31:04.999
incomplete, like we saw with the blobby bee

00:31:00.679 --> 00:31:06.340
example, and any given sensory input like

00:31:04.999 --> 00:31:10.679
a flash of light can have

00:31:06.340 --> 00:31:14.320
many different causes. So your brain

00:31:10.679 --> 00:31:17.049
has this dilemma. And it doesn't just

00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:19.570
have this dilemma based on sensory

00:31:17.049 --> 00:31:22.750
inputs from the world. It also has this

00:31:19.570 --> 00:31:28.059
dilemma to solve regarding the sensory

00:31:22.750 --> 00:31:30.640
inputs from your body. So, there are

00:31:28.059 --> 00:31:33.130
sensations that come from your body, like

00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:36.190
your lungs expanding and contracting and

00:31:33.130 --> 00:31:38.350
your heart beating, and there are

00:31:36.190 --> 00:31:41.230
sensations from moving your muscles and

00:31:38.350 --> 00:31:46.690
from metabolizing glucose, and so on and

00:31:41.230 --> 00:31:50.020
so forth. And the the same kind of

00:31:46.690 --> 00:31:52.240
problem that we face with having to make

00:31:50.020 --> 00:31:54.250
sense of information from the world we

00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:56.470
we also face from having to make sense

00:31:54.250 --> 00:32:00.100
of our own bodies, which are largely a

00:31:56.470 --> 00:32:03.159
mystery to the brain, more or less. So, an

00:32:00.100 --> 00:32:05.110
ache in your gut, for example, could be

00:32:03.159 --> 00:32:06.760
experienced as hunger if you were

00:32:05.110 --> 00:32:08.980
sitting at a dinner table. But if you

00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:12.159
were in a doctor's office waiting for

00:32:08.980 --> 00:32:14.020
test results, that gut, that ache in

00:32:12.159 --> 00:32:16.929
your gut would be experienced as anxiety.

00:32:14.020 --> 00:32:20.710
And if you were a judge in a courtroom,

00:32:16.929 --> 00:32:24.309
that ache would be experienced as a gut

00:32:20.710 --> 00:32:27.520
feeling that the defendant can't be

00:32:24.309 --> 00:32:29.529
trusted. So, your brain is basically

00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:31.510
constantly trying to solve a reverse

00:32:29.529 --> 00:32:34.870
inference problem, because it has to

00:32:31.510 --> 00:32:37.270
determine the causes of sensations when

00:32:34.870 --> 00:32:41.980
all it actually has access to are the

00:32:37.270 --> 00:32:45.399
effects. And so, how does it do this? How

00:32:41.980 --> 00:32:47.409
does the brain resolve this, this reverse

00:32:45.399 --> 00:32:49.210
inference problem? And the answer is by

00:32:47.409 --> 00:32:54.640
remembering past experiences that are

00:32:49.210 --> 00:32:59.380
similar in some way. So, it's remembering

00:32:54.640 --> 00:33:02.010
past experiences where physical changes

00:32:59.380 --> 00:33:04.179
in the world and in the body are

00:33:02.010 --> 00:33:10.919
functionally similar to the present

00:33:04.179 --> 00:33:16.360
conditions. Similar. It's creating,

00:33:10.919 --> 00:33:19.180
basically, categories. So,

00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:23.290
your brain is using past experience to

00:33:19.180 --> 00:33:28.150
create ad hoc categories to make sense

00:33:23.290 --> 00:33:31.020
of sensory inputs, so that it knows what

00:33:28.150 --> 00:33:33.670
they are and what to do about them. And

00:33:31.020 --> 00:33:36.850
these categories represent the causal

00:33:33.670 --> 00:33:39.550
relationships between the events in the

00:33:36.850 --> 00:33:41.200
world and in the body, and the

00:33:39.550 --> 00:33:43.840
consequences, which is what the brain

00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:46.750
actually detects. And this is actually

00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:48.100
how your brain is wired to work. It's

00:33:46.750 --> 00:33:49.750
wired to work this way. It's

00:33:48.100 --> 00:33:52.060
metabolically efficient to work this way.

00:33:49.750 --> 00:33:54.040
And this is how your brain constructs

00:33:52.060 --> 00:33:57.040
all of your experiences and guides all

00:33:54.040 --> 00:33:58.930
of your actions. Your brain begins with

00:33:57.040 --> 00:34:00.400
the initial conditions in the body and

00:33:58.930 --> 00:34:03.220
in the world, and then it predicts

00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:04.240
forward in time, predicting what's about

00:34:03.220 --> 00:34:06.910
to happen next,

00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:10.600
by creating categories that are

00:34:06.910 --> 00:34:13.600
candidates to make sense of incoming

00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:15.250
sensory inputs. To make them meaningful,

00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:17.530
so that your brain knows what to do next.

00:34:15.250 --> 00:34:19.420
And the information from the world and

00:34:17.530 --> 00:34:24.100
from the body either confirms those

00:34:19.420 --> 00:34:27.550
categories, or it, it prompts the brain to

00:34:24.100 --> 00:34:30.490
to learn something and try again. It

00:34:27.550 --> 00:34:35.350
updates and then the brain makes another

00:34:30.490 --> 00:34:38.590
attempt at categorization. So, emotions

00:34:35.350 --> 00:34:40.750
are not, you know, reactions to the world.

00:34:38.590 --> 00:34:42.340
They are actually your constructions of

00:34:40.750 --> 00:34:43.600
the world. It's not like something

00:34:42.340 --> 00:34:45.460
happens in the world and then you react

00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:47.490
to it with an emotion. In fact, what's

00:34:45.460 --> 00:34:51.820
happening is that your brain is

00:34:47.490 --> 00:34:55.420
constructing an experience, an episode, or

00:34:51.820 --> 00:34:58.480
an event, where what it's trying to

00:34:55.420 --> 00:35:01.030
do is make sense of or categorize what

00:34:58.480 --> 00:35:03.580
is going on inside your own body, like an

00:35:01.030 --> 00:35:05.170
ache, in relation to what's happening in

00:35:03.580 --> 00:35:10.390
the world, like being in a doctor's

00:35:05.170 --> 00:35:12.610
office. So, emotions are basically brain

00:35:10.390 --> 00:35:17.770
guesses that are forged by billions of

00:35:12.610 --> 00:35:20.170
neurons working together. And so, the

00:35:17.770 --> 00:35:25.020
emotions that seem to happen to you are

00:35:20.170 --> 00:35:25.020
actually made by you.

00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:32.099
And categorization is also how your

00:35:30.059 --> 00:35:34.890
brain allows you to see emotions in

00:35:32.099 --> 00:35:37.829
other people. So, your brain remembers

00:35:34.890 --> 00:35:40.559
past experiences from similar situations

00:35:37.829 --> 00:35:42.359
to make meaning of the present, you know,

00:35:40.559 --> 00:35:48.839
to make meaning of the raise of an

00:35:42.359 --> 00:35:51.839
eyebrow, or the movement of the mouth, and

00:35:48.839 --> 00:35:53.549
so on. So, to perceive emotion in somebody

00:35:51.839 --> 00:35:56.819
else, what your brain is actually doing

00:35:53.549 --> 00:35:59.039
is it's categorizing that person's

00:35:56.819 --> 00:36:01.289
facial movements, and their body

00:35:59.039 --> 00:36:03.809
movements, and the acoustics of their

00:36:01.289 --> 00:36:05.460
voice, and the surrounding context, and

00:36:03.809 --> 00:36:09.150
actually stuff that's happening inside

00:36:05.460 --> 00:36:12.539
their own bodies, all conditioned on past

00:36:09.150 --> 00:36:13.440
experience. So, even though when we're

00:36:12.539 --> 00:36:15.000
talking to each other,

00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:17.010
we're mainly looking at each other's

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:18.660
faces, and we're aware of the

00:36:17.010 --> 00:36:20.579
movements of each other's faces, and we

00:36:18.660 --> 00:36:23.250
might be maybe aware of the tone of

00:36:20.579 --> 00:36:25.260
voice, our attention is not given to

00:36:23.250 --> 00:36:28.349
the rest of the sensory array that the

00:36:25.260 --> 00:36:30.150
brain has available, including what's

00:36:28.349 --> 00:36:32.220
going on inside your own body. You know,

00:36:30.150 --> 00:36:33.990
your body, inside your own body, is a

00:36:32.220 --> 00:36:36.240
context that you carry around with you

00:36:33.990 --> 00:36:39.359
everywhere you go, that is involved in

00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:43.950
every single action and experience that

00:36:39.359 --> 00:36:45.390
your brain creates. Largely, you are largely,

00:36:43.950 --> 00:36:50.220
and you are largely unaware of it,

00:36:45.390 --> 00:36:53.240
actually. And this is how a scowl can

00:36:50.220 --> 00:36:56.039
become anger or confusion or

00:36:53.240 --> 00:36:58.559
indigestion or even amusement;

00:36:56.039 --> 00:37:02.069
so that emotions that you seem to detect

00:36:58.559 --> 00:37:06.269
and other people are partly made inside

00:37:02.069 --> 00:37:08.819
your own head. So, when one human

00:37:06.269 --> 00:37:11.519
perceives emotion in another person, she

00:37:08.819 --> 00:37:16.230
is not "detecting" emotion. Her brain is

00:37:11.519 --> 00:37:18.809
guessing by creating categories for

00:37:16.230 --> 00:37:21.390
emotion in the moment. And this is how a

00:37:18.809 --> 00:37:22.769
single physical feature can take on

00:37:21.390 --> 00:37:25.259
different emotional meanings in

00:37:22.769 --> 00:37:28.440
different contexts. So, for a machine to

00:37:25.259 --> 00:37:30.960
perceive emotion, it has to be trained on

00:37:28.440 --> 00:37:35.339
more than stereotypes. It actually has to

00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:37.319
capture the full high-dimensional, the

00:37:35.339 --> 00:37:40.380
high-dimensional detail of the context,

00:37:37.319 --> 00:37:42.509
not just measuring a face, or a face

00:37:40.380 --> 00:37:46.380
and a body, which is inherently ambiguous

00:37:42.509 --> 00:37:48.210
without the context. So, perceiving

00:37:46.380 --> 00:37:51.299
emotion means learning to construct

00:37:48.210 --> 00:37:54.599
categories using the features from

00:37:51.299 --> 00:37:57.630
biology, like faces and bodies and brains,

00:37:54.599 --> 00:37:58.890
but in a particular context. And the

00:37:57.630 --> 00:38:00.329
thing I want to point out here is that

00:37:58.890 --> 00:38:02.130
I'm using the context, the word

00:38:00.329 --> 00:38:04.739
"context," pretty liberally here, because

00:38:02.130 --> 00:38:07.229
context also often includes the

00:38:04.739 --> 00:38:09.900
actions of other people, right? So we are

00:38:07.229 --> 00:38:12.809
social animals, and other humans make up

00:38:09.900 --> 00:38:14.900
important parts of our context, which

00:38:12.809 --> 00:38:18.749
suggests that when you want to measure,

00:38:14.900 --> 00:38:22.140
when you want to detect emotion in

00:38:18.749 --> 00:38:24.119
a person, you want to build AI, you're

00:38:22.140 --> 00:38:26.700
measuring the context, you might consider

00:38:24.119 --> 00:38:29.479
also measuring the physical changes in

00:38:26.700 --> 00:38:33.259
the people who are around that person,

00:38:29.479 --> 00:38:35.519
because that can give you a clue about

00:38:33.259 --> 00:38:39.299
about what the physical changes in the

00:38:35.519 --> 00:38:41.970
target person really mean. So, measuring

00:38:39.299 --> 00:38:44.160
the features of other people, that is,

00:38:41.970 --> 00:38:46.019
their physical changes and actions, that

00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:47.910
are contingent on the biological changes

00:38:46.019 --> 00:38:52.170
in the person of interest, is a an

00:38:47.910 --> 00:38:55.079
extension of the idea of context

00:38:52.170 --> 00:38:56.369
which is really important. And in the

00:38:55.079 --> 00:38:59.069
last few minutes what I'm going to do is

00:38:56.369 --> 00:39:00.690
switch gears here, from perceiving

00:38:59.069 --> 00:39:02.130
emotion to ask whether it's possible to

00:39:00.690 --> 00:39:05.880
build machines who can actually

00:39:02.130 --> 00:39:08.849
experience emotion the way that humans

00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:11.039
do. And this is a question I think that

00:39:08.849 --> 00:39:12.599
interests AI, people who work in AI,

00:39:11.039 --> 00:39:15.960
often because they're interested in

00:39:12.599 --> 00:39:17.849
questions about empathy. And so, if

00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:22.319
emotions are made by categorizing

00:39:17.849 --> 00:39:24.089
sensations from the body and from the

00:39:22.319 --> 00:39:27.599
surrounding context using past

00:39:24.089 --> 00:39:29.430
experience, then machines would need all

00:39:27.599 --> 00:39:31.440
three of these ingredients, or something

00:39:29.430 --> 00:39:33.450
like them. And so, we're going to just

00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:36.180
take this really quickly one at a time.

00:39:33.450 --> 00:39:38.339
So, the first is past experience. Can

00:39:36.180 --> 00:39:40.619
machines actually recall past experience?

00:39:38.339 --> 00:39:41.989
Well, machines are really great at

00:39:40.619 --> 00:39:44.640
storage and retrieval.

00:39:41.989 --> 00:39:47.279
Unfortunately brains don't work like a

00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:49.829
file system. Memories aren't retrieved

00:39:47.279 --> 00:39:52.359
like files. They are, memories are

00:39:49.829 --> 00:39:54.609
dynamically constructed in the moment. And

00:39:52.359 --> 00:39:56.859
brains have this amazing capacity to

00:39:54.609 --> 00:39:59.680
kind of combine bits and pieces of the

00:39:56.859 --> 00:40:03.930
past in novel ways. They're... brains are

00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:07.029
generative. They are information-gaining

00:40:03.930 --> 00:40:09.700
structures. They can create new content,

00:40:07.029 --> 00:40:11.680
not just merely reinstate old content,

00:40:09.700 --> 00:40:15.460
which is necessary for constructing

00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:18.730
categories on the fly. To my knowledge -

00:40:15.460 --> 00:40:20.230
and maybe, you know, which might be out of

00:40:18.730 --> 00:40:22.599
date, but to my knowledge - there are no

00:40:20.230 --> 00:40:25.299
computing systems that are powered by

00:40:22.599 --> 00:40:28.059
dynamic categorization, that can create

00:40:25.299 --> 00:40:30.369
abstract categories by grouping things

00:40:28.059 --> 00:40:32.859
together that are physically dissimilar

00:40:30.369 --> 00:40:34.960
but because they, they are all in that

00:40:32.859 --> 00:40:38.529
particular situation serving a similar

00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:43.089
function. So, an important challenge for

00:40:38.529 --> 00:40:45.339
computers to experience emotion is to be

00:40:43.089 --> 00:40:47.980
able to develop computing systems that

00:40:45.339 --> 00:40:50.890
have that capability. The second

00:40:47.980 --> 00:40:53.200
ingredient is context. So, computers are

00:40:50.890 --> 00:40:56.319
getting better and better at sensing the

00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:59.579
world. So, there are advances in computer

00:40:56.319 --> 00:41:03.640
vision and speech recognition and so on.

00:40:59.579 --> 00:41:05.589
But a system doesn't just have to detect

00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:08.920
information in the world. It also has to

00:41:05.589 --> 00:41:11.470
decide which information is relevant, and

00:41:08.920 --> 00:41:15.819
which information is not, right? This is

00:41:11.470 --> 00:41:19.079
the "signal vs. noise" problem. And this

00:41:15.819 --> 00:41:21.789
is what scientists call "value." So, value

00:41:19.079 --> 00:41:26.160
is not something that's detectable in

00:41:21.789 --> 00:41:28.960
the world. Value is not a property of

00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:30.489
sights and sounds and so on, or the

00:41:28.960 --> 00:41:33.549
information that creates sights and

00:41:30.489 --> 00:41:36.220
sounds, and so on, from the world. Value is

00:41:33.549 --> 00:41:38.499
a function of that information in

00:41:36.220 --> 00:41:40.690
relation to the state of the organism or

00:41:38.499 --> 00:41:42.339
the system that's doing the sensing. So,

00:41:40.690 --> 00:41:46.180
if there's a blurry shape in the

00:41:42.339 --> 00:41:49.359
distance, does it have value for you as

00:41:46.180 --> 00:41:51.190
food, or can you ignore it? Well, partly

00:41:49.359 --> 00:41:54.339
that depends on what the shape is, but it

00:41:51.190 --> 00:41:57.999
also depends on when you last ate, and

00:41:54.339 --> 00:41:59.499
even more importantly, the value also

00:41:57.999 --> 00:42:02.499
depends on whether or not that shape

00:41:59.499 --> 00:42:04.809
wants to eat you. And so, to solve this

00:42:02.499 --> 00:42:05.600
problem, it turns out that, you know, the

00:42:04.809 --> 00:42:08.270
brain didn't

00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:09.920
start off, in terms of

00:42:08.270 --> 00:42:14.060
brain evolution, it didn't start off with

00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:16.640
systems that allow creatures to compute

00:42:14.060 --> 00:42:18.680
value. Those evolved in concert with

00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:22.760
sensory systems, in concert with the

00:42:18.680 --> 00:42:27.620
ability to see and hear and so on, for

00:42:22.760 --> 00:42:30.940
exactly this reason. And so, evolution

00:42:27.620 --> 00:42:34.160
basically gave us brain circuitry that

00:42:30.940 --> 00:42:36.440
allows us to compute value, which also

00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:38.930
gives us our mood, or what scientists

00:42:36.440 --> 00:42:40.850
call "affect," which are simple feelings of

00:42:38.930 --> 00:42:44.180
feeling pleasant, feeling unpleasant,

00:42:40.850 --> 00:42:46.850
feeling worked up, feeling calm. Affect or

00:42:44.180 --> 00:42:49.430
mood is not emotion. It's just a quick

00:42:46.850 --> 00:42:51.230
summary of the state of what's going on

00:42:49.430 --> 00:42:54.170
inside your own body, like a barometer.

00:42:51.230 --> 00:42:55.820
And affect is a signal that something is

00:42:54.170 --> 00:42:58.760
relevant to your body or not - whether

00:42:55.820 --> 00:43:00.590
that thing has value to you or not. And

00:42:58.760 --> 00:43:02.330
so, for a machine to experience emotion,

00:43:00.590 --> 00:43:05.480
it also needs something that allows it

00:43:02.330 --> 00:43:09.770
to estimate the value of things in the

00:43:05.480 --> 00:43:13.280
world in relation to a body. Which brings

00:43:09.770 --> 00:43:15.230
us to the third ingredient: brains

00:43:13.280 --> 00:43:19.240
evolved for the purposes of controlling

00:43:15.230 --> 00:43:21.440
and balancing the systems of a body.

00:43:19.240 --> 00:43:24.020
Brains didn't evolve so that we could

00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:27.110
see really well, or hear really well, or

00:43:24.020 --> 00:43:31.040
feel anything. They evolved to control

00:43:27.110 --> 00:43:33.770
the body, to keep the systems of the body

00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:35.390
in balance. And the bigger the body gets,

00:43:33.770 --> 00:43:41.330
with the more systems, the bigger the

00:43:35.390 --> 00:43:43.220
brain gets. So, a disembodied brain has no

00:43:41.330 --> 00:43:45.260
bodily systems to balance. It has no

00:43:43.220 --> 00:43:48.950
bodily sensations to make sense of. It

00:43:45.260 --> 00:43:51.560
has no affect to signal value. So a

00:43:48.950 --> 00:43:54.530
disembodied brain would not experience

00:43:51.560 --> 00:43:57.140
emotion. Which means that for a machine

00:43:54.530 --> 00:44:00.590
to experience emotion like a human does,

00:43:57.140 --> 00:44:03.500
it needs a body, or something LIKE a body:

00:44:00.590 --> 00:44:06.110
a collection of systems that it has to

00:44:03.500 --> 00:44:09.020
keep in balance, with sensations that it

00:44:06.110 --> 00:44:12.770
has to explain. And to me, I think this is

00:44:09.020 --> 00:44:15.140
the most surprising insight about AI and

00:44:12.770 --> 00:44:17.560
emotion. I'm not saying that a machine

00:44:15.140 --> 00:44:19.310
has to have an actual flesh-and-blood

00:44:17.560 --> 00:44:21.320
body to

00:44:19.310 --> 00:44:24.220
experience emotions. But I am suggesting

00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:28.130
that it needs something like a body, and

00:44:24.220 --> 00:44:29.600
I have a deep belief that there are

00:44:28.130 --> 00:44:32.540
clever engineers who can come up with

00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:34.280
something that is enough like a body to

00:44:32.540 --> 00:44:39.050
provide this necessary ingredient for

00:44:34.280 --> 00:44:41.570
emotion. Now these ideas and others, the

00:44:39.050 --> 00:44:43.580
science behind them and related ideas,

00:44:41.570 --> 00:44:47.020
can be found in my book, "How Emotions are

00:44:43.580 --> 00:44:49.310
Made: The Secret Life of the Brain," and

00:44:47.020 --> 00:44:52.220
there's also additional information on

00:44:49.310 --> 00:44:54.080
my website. And even though this is not,

00:44:52.220 --> 00:44:57.380
strictly speaking... I'm not throwing tons

00:44:54.080 --> 00:45:00.140
of data at you, I do always at the end of

00:44:57.380 --> 00:45:02.450
talks like to thank my lab. They really are,

00:45:00.140 --> 00:45:05.720
they're the ones who actually do all the

00:45:02.450 --> 00:45:06.980
really hard work. You know, scientists

00:45:05.720 --> 00:45:11.570
like me just get to stand up here and

00:45:06.980 --> 00:45:13.310
talk about it, so I just want to thank

00:45:11.570 --> 00:45:20.840
them as well, and thank you for your

00:45:13.310 --> 00:45:23.240
attention, and I'll take questions. I am

00:45:20.840 --> 00:45:26.300
wondering how someone who is say blind

00:45:23.240 --> 00:45:28.790
from birth will perceive emotion because

00:45:26.300 --> 00:45:31.370
they don't they cannot depend on visual

00:45:28.790 --> 00:45:33.410
cues whether it's facial expression or

00:45:31.370 --> 00:45:38.300
body language so I'm guessing they

00:45:33.410 --> 00:45:41.210
usually go off of vocal tones or lack

00:45:38.300 --> 00:45:44.270
thereof have you looked into their

00:45:41.210 --> 00:45:46.550
accuracy of predicting emotions and is

00:45:44.270 --> 00:45:50.930
that better or worse than people who

00:45:46.550 --> 00:45:53.180
rely on visual cues? So people who are

00:45:50.930 --> 00:45:56.330
born congenitally blind have no

00:45:53.180 --> 00:45:57.860
difficulty experiencing emotion and they

00:45:56.330 --> 00:45:59.600
have no difficulty in perceiving emotion

00:45:57.860 --> 00:46:01.910
through the sensory channels that they

00:45:59.600 --> 00:46:03.890
have access to because their brains work

00:46:01.910 --> 00:46:07.490
largely in the same way that a sighted

00:46:03.890 --> 00:46:10.730
person's brain works at birth the brain

00:46:07.490 --> 00:46:14.660
is collecting patterns statistical

00:46:10.730 --> 00:46:16.730
patterns and so it's just vision isn't

00:46:14.660 --> 00:46:20.480
part of that pattern and what's really

00:46:16.730 --> 00:46:23.050
interesting actually is that so for

00:46:20.480 --> 00:46:25.760
someone who is is congenitally blind

00:46:23.050 --> 00:46:29.540
they they're learning patterns that

00:46:25.760 --> 00:46:33.110
include you know changes in sound

00:46:29.540 --> 00:46:35.300
pressure that become hearing changes

00:46:33.110 --> 00:46:37.730
in the pressure on the skin which

00:46:35.300 --> 00:46:39.650
becomes touch and they have taste

00:46:37.730 --> 00:46:42.020
they have sensations from the body which

00:46:39.650 --> 00:46:43.550
become affect so they can do multimodal

00:46:42.020 --> 00:46:45.740
learning just like the rest of us and

00:46:43.550 --> 00:46:47.990
they can learn to experience and express

00:46:45.740 --> 00:46:49.400
emotion and perceive it through the

00:46:47.990 --> 00:46:52.040
channels they have access to what's

00:46:49.400 --> 00:46:54.530
really interesting is that when adults

00:46:52.040 --> 00:46:58.070
have let's say who are congenitally

00:46:54.530 --> 00:47:00.890
blind because they have cataracts have

00:46:58.070 --> 00:47:05.180
those cataracts removed for the first

00:47:00.890 --> 00:47:07.670
time they can see or they should be able

00:47:05.180 --> 00:47:11.900
to see but actually it takes them a

00:47:07.670 --> 00:47:14.180
while to learn to see and when they

00:47:11.900 --> 00:47:15.740
finally learn to see they their

00:47:14.180 --> 00:47:17.840
experience if you talk to these people

00:47:15.740 --> 00:47:20.870
what they say is that they feel

00:47:17.840 --> 00:47:23.630
like they're always guessing what faces

00:47:20.870 --> 00:47:27.680
mean and what body postures mean they

00:47:23.630 --> 00:47:30.910
find faces in particular hard for

00:47:27.680 --> 00:47:33.530
example even as one there's one person

00:47:30.910 --> 00:47:35.030
Michael May who's been studied really

00:47:33.530 --> 00:47:37.280
extensively over a number of years and

00:47:35.030 --> 00:47:41.030
even a couple of years after his

00:47:37.280 --> 00:47:42.710
cataracts were replaced his cornea so

00:47:41.030 --> 00:47:45.920
he had corneal abrasions that so his

00:47:42.710 --> 00:47:49.190
cornea were replaced he was still

00:47:45.920 --> 00:47:50.810
guessing consciously guessing at whether

00:47:49.190 --> 00:47:52.910
a face was male or female

00:47:50.810 --> 00:47:56.050
before someone spoke he just it was

00:47:52.910 --> 00:47:59.330
really hard for him to do and he

00:47:56.050 --> 00:48:01.670
experienced his vision as separate from

00:47:59.330 --> 00:48:04.480
everything else like a like a second

00:48:01.670 --> 00:48:08.420
language that he was learning to speak

00:48:04.480 --> 00:48:11.330
which had no affect to it right so so

00:48:08.420 --> 00:48:12.770
but the answer to your question is so

00:48:11.330 --> 00:48:14.540
we could ask a bunch of

00:48:12.770 --> 00:48:16.010
questions like so do blind people who

00:48:14.540 --> 00:48:18.650
are congenitally blind do they actually

00:48:16.010 --> 00:48:20.690
make facial expressions you know the way

00:48:18.650 --> 00:48:25.280
that a sighted person does and the

00:48:20.690 --> 00:48:26.930
answer is they their facial movement

00:48:25.280 --> 00:48:29.180
they don't make the stereotypic

00:48:26.930 --> 00:48:32.830
expressions when they're angry or sad or

00:48:29.180 --> 00:48:36.280
whatever but they do learn to make

00:48:32.830 --> 00:48:39.920
deliberate movements in a particular way

00:48:36.280 --> 00:48:42.500
for example when they there are these

00:48:39.920 --> 00:48:45.509
studies showing that when congenitally

00:48:42.500 --> 00:48:48.959
blind athletes win an award and they

00:48:45.509 --> 00:48:51.689
they know they're being filmed

00:48:48.959 --> 00:48:56.249
they will make body movements that

00:48:51.689 --> 00:48:57.419
indicate being really thrilled but they

00:48:56.249 --> 00:48:59.039
don't but they're doing it because

00:48:57.419 --> 00:49:01.739
they've learned it in the in the same

00:48:59.039 --> 00:49:04.409
way that if you test a congenitally

00:49:01.739 --> 00:49:06.389
blind person on the meaning of color

00:49:04.409 --> 00:49:08.549
words their mapping of color words

00:49:06.389 --> 00:49:10.169
largely is the same as a sighted person's

00:49:08.549 --> 00:49:11.609
because they've learned

00:49:10.169 --> 00:49:13.889
from the statistical regularities in

00:49:11.609 --> 00:49:15.329
language which words are more similar to

00:49:13.889 --> 00:49:17.789
each other and which ones aren't so

00:49:15.329 --> 00:49:20.819
their abilities at emotion perception

00:49:17.789 --> 00:49:22.829
and emotion expression largely look the

00:49:20.819 --> 00:49:24.539
same as a sighted person's

00:49:22.829 --> 00:49:26.339
without the without the visual component

00:49:24.539 --> 00:49:30.779
was really interesting is that people

00:49:26.339 --> 00:49:34.769
who are congenitally deaf who don't who

00:49:30.779 --> 00:49:37.199
who tend to learn mental state language

00:49:34.769 --> 00:49:40.799
they develop concepts for mental states

00:49:37.199 --> 00:49:43.880
later also are delayed in their ability

00:49:40.799 --> 00:49:47.429
to perceive emotion in other people so

00:49:43.880 --> 00:49:50.009
that literature suggests a coupling

00:49:47.429 --> 00:49:53.759
between emotion words and the ability to

00:49:50.009 --> 00:49:54.349
learn to form emotion categories in

00:49:53.759 --> 00:49:57.089
childhood.

00:49:54.349 --> 00:49:59.819
so you said an essential component in

00:49:57.089 --> 00:50:05.609
recognizing an emotion is the context. I

00:49:59.819 --> 00:50:09.449
would never say recognizing but yeah. if

00:50:05.609 --> 00:50:12.419
we didn't have the context and but we

00:50:09.449 --> 00:50:14.969
could monitor whatever is happening

00:50:12.419 --> 00:50:18.289
inside a person's body and and the brain

00:50:14.969 --> 00:50:21.029
really well would we be able to

00:50:18.289 --> 00:50:23.279
recognize emotions and and what

00:50:21.029 --> 00:50:25.739
specifically would it take what would we

00:50:23.279 --> 00:50:27.239
want to monitor? Yeah so it's interesting

00:50:25.739 --> 00:50:28.199
the I mean when I was originally

00:50:27.239 --> 00:50:30.299
thinking about giving this talk I

00:50:28.199 --> 00:50:35.119
thought I might start with machine

00:50:30.299 --> 00:50:38.039
learning attempts to identify emotion

00:50:35.119 --> 00:50:40.469
with neural activity patterns of neural

00:50:38.039 --> 00:50:45.569
activity and it turns out that you can

00:50:40.469 --> 00:50:49.199
in a given study if you if you show

00:50:45.569 --> 00:50:51.419
people films say and you try to evoke

00:50:49.199 --> 00:50:53.669
emotions by showing them films you can

00:50:51.419 --> 00:50:57.929
actually build a pattern classifier that

00:50:53.669 --> 00:51:00.270
can distinguish anger from sadness from

00:50:57.929 --> 00:51:03.029
fear

00:51:00.270 --> 00:51:05.640
meaning you can distinguish when people

00:51:03.029 --> 00:51:07.500
are watching films that

00:51:05.640 --> 00:51:10.650
presumably evoke anger versus sadness

00:51:07.500 --> 00:51:13.589
versus fear the problem with those

00:51:10.650 --> 00:51:15.839
studies is that that classifier can't be

00:51:13.589 --> 00:51:17.760
used in another study like it doesn't

00:51:15.839 --> 00:51:21.480
generalize right so you're what you're

00:51:17.760 --> 00:51:23.000
building is you're building a set of

00:51:21.480 --> 00:51:27.029
classifiers that work in a specific

00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:29.970
context but when you generalize try to

00:51:27.029 --> 00:51:34.380
generalize to another sample of subjects

00:51:29.970 --> 00:51:37.230
maybe so let me say it this way if you

00:51:34.380 --> 00:51:39.960
have the same subjects in the same study

00:51:37.230 --> 00:51:41.789
watch movies and so you evoke anger by

00:51:39.960 --> 00:51:43.799
watching a movie and you evoke anger by

00:51:41.789 --> 00:51:48.210
having them let's say remember a prior

00:51:43.799 --> 00:51:50.549
anger episode you get you can classify

00:51:48.210 --> 00:51:52.589
the emotions and distinguish them

00:51:50.549 --> 00:51:55.079
from one another and you can you get a

00:51:52.589 --> 00:51:57.690
little bit of carryover from one

00:51:55.079 --> 00:51:59.599
modality of evoking to another but if

00:51:57.690 --> 00:52:02.630
you go to a completely separate study

00:51:59.599 --> 00:52:05.579
the patterns look completely different

00:52:02.630 --> 00:52:07.740
and this is true across hundreds of

00:52:05.579 --> 00:52:09.180
studies so for example we developed a we

00:52:07.740 --> 00:52:11.520
have I published a pattern

00:52:09.180 --> 00:52:14.190
classification paper where we use 400

00:52:11.520 --> 00:52:16.079
studies and we developed these

00:52:14.190 --> 00:52:19.470
classifiers based on this meta-analytic

00:52:16.079 --> 00:52:21.480
database that that those classifiers are

00:52:19.470 --> 00:52:23.220
not successful at classifying any new

00:52:21.480 --> 00:52:25.920
set of instances I mean they show really

00:52:23.220 --> 00:52:28.440
good you know I mean we used to leave

00:52:25.920 --> 00:52:30.029
one out method we used a you know

00:52:28.440 --> 00:52:31.049
multivariate Bayesian approach you know

00:52:30.029 --> 00:52:34.109
there are no problems with the

00:52:31.049 --> 00:52:35.910
statistics the issue is that when

00:52:34.109 --> 00:52:38.400
scientists do this they believe that

00:52:35.910 --> 00:52:40.109
what they're discovering in these

00:52:38.400 --> 00:52:42.089
patterns is actually a literal brain

00:52:40.109 --> 00:52:43.589
state for the emotion the literal brain

00:52:42.089 --> 00:52:45.960
state for anger and then they think it

00:52:43.589 --> 00:52:47.849
should generalize to something to every

00:52:45.960 --> 00:52:50.250
brain to every instance of anger and

00:52:47.849 --> 00:52:54.410
they don't generalize usually outside of

00:52:50.250 --> 00:52:57.930
their own studies this is also true for

00:52:54.410 --> 00:53:00.059
physiology where so we just published a

00:52:57.930 --> 00:53:01.950
meta-analysis where we examined the

00:53:00.059 --> 00:53:03.900
physiological changes in people's bodies

00:53:01.950 --> 00:53:06.690
like their heart rate changes their

00:53:03.900 --> 00:53:10.349
breathing their skin conductance and so

00:53:06.690 --> 00:53:12.710
on and you you see that these physical

00:53:10.349 --> 00:53:15.200
measures can distinguish

00:53:12.710 --> 00:53:17.630
sometimes one emotion category

00:53:15.200 --> 00:53:19.369
from another in a study but they don't

00:53:17.630 --> 00:53:21.290
generalize across studies and in fact

00:53:19.369 --> 00:53:25.760
the patterns themselves really change

00:53:21.290 --> 00:53:27.410
from study to study and so there's when

00:53:25.760 --> 00:53:31.190
you look at it in a meta-analytic sense

00:53:27.410 --> 00:53:32.900
it looks like for all emotions

00:53:31.190 --> 00:53:34.430
heart rate could go up or go down or

00:53:32.900 --> 00:53:38.390
stay the same depending on what the

00:53:34.430 --> 00:53:40.790
situation is so there's so far no one

00:53:38.390 --> 00:53:42.950
has done a really high-dimensional

00:53:40.790 --> 00:53:45.380
nobody's made a really high-dimensional

00:53:42.950 --> 00:53:47.180
attempt at this meaning they haven't

00:53:45.380 --> 00:53:49.280
tried to measure the brain and measure

00:53:47.180 --> 00:53:52.790
the body and measure the face and

00:53:49.280 --> 00:53:54.260
measure aspects of the context that's

00:53:52.790 --> 00:53:56.119
actually what I think needs to be done

00:53:54.260 --> 00:53:57.680
so I think this is a solvable problem I

00:53:56.119 --> 00:54:00.320
just think we have not been going about

00:53:57.680 --> 00:54:05.660
it in the right way and I think that

00:54:00.320 --> 00:54:08.000
this is a real opportunity for for any

00:54:05.660 --> 00:54:11.570
company that is serious about doing this

00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:14.000
I love the way you mentioned in the book

00:54:11.570 --> 00:54:17.420
that and then the talk is well how we

00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:19.040
perceive emotions based on context so we

00:54:17.420 --> 00:54:20.660
look at the context and then we infer

00:54:19.040 --> 00:54:22.339
emotion and one of the examples that you

00:54:20.660 --> 00:54:25.640
have in the book and and you have here

00:54:22.339 --> 00:54:26.390
as well was Serena Williams winning a

00:54:25.640 --> 00:54:31.040
Grand Slam

00:54:26.390 --> 00:54:32.990
and you have Jim Webb I switched it out

00:54:31.040 --> 00:54:34.790
people were starting to say oh that's

00:54:32.990 --> 00:54:36.800
Serena Williams oh okay well that's

00:54:34.790 --> 00:54:39.140
right yeah so but there's something that

00:54:36.800 --> 00:54:42.380
is troubling to me at least in that in

00:54:39.140 --> 00:54:44.390
that example well I think that's that's

00:54:42.380 --> 00:54:47.020
certainly possible and what I would say

00:54:44.390 --> 00:54:50.510
what I would say to that though is that

00:54:47.020 --> 00:54:53.450
there are studies particularly by Hillel

00:54:50.510 --> 00:54:55.160
Aviezer who's actually done work you

00:54:53.450 --> 00:54:58.730
know he didn't I published the picture

00:54:55.160 --> 00:55:01.609
of Serena Williams in 2007 I published

00:54:58.730 --> 00:55:04.130
an example and Hillel came out with a

00:55:01.609 --> 00:55:06.170
great set of experiments in 2008 and

00:55:04.130 --> 00:55:10.810
then again in 2012 and he proceeded to

00:55:06.170 --> 00:55:13.369
continue where he knows he has the

00:55:10.810 --> 00:55:16.310
reports of people people's subjective

00:55:13.369 --> 00:55:19.730
experience and he has their facial

00:55:16.310 --> 00:55:22.580
movements and in fact there are meta-

00:55:19.730 --> 00:55:24.589
analyses which have the subjective

00:55:22.580 --> 00:55:26.150
reports of people and their facial

00:55:24.589 --> 00:55:27.950
movements and in some time

00:55:26.150 --> 00:55:30.140
also the reports of people interacting

00:55:27.950 --> 00:55:37.300
with the people whose faces have been

00:55:30.140 --> 00:55:41.780
and there's no evidence that the

00:55:37.300 --> 00:55:44.450
variability is due to a

00:55:41.780 --> 00:55:48.110
series of quick emotions being evoked

00:55:44.450 --> 00:55:50.390
over time so what you know but I want to

00:55:48.110 --> 00:55:54.230
back up one step and say this when when

00:55:50.390 --> 00:55:56.540
you ask the question well maybe Serena

00:55:54.230 --> 00:55:58.220
Williams is really experiencing maybe

00:55:56.540 --> 00:56:00.050
she really is in a state of anger in

00:55:58.220 --> 00:56:02.450
that moment or in that case it's

00:56:00.050 --> 00:56:08.240
actually looks like fear more or terror

00:56:02.450 --> 00:56:10.130
more when you say really that implies

00:56:08.240 --> 00:56:11.840
that there's some objective criterion

00:56:10.130 --> 00:56:13.760
that you could use to measure the state

00:56:11.840 --> 00:56:15.920
that Serena Williams is really in and

00:56:13.760 --> 00:56:20.450
there is no objective criterion for any

00:56:15.920 --> 00:56:23.270
emotion that's ever been studied ever so

00:56:20.450 --> 00:56:25.670
what scientists use is agreement they

00:56:23.270 --> 00:56:28.940
use collective agreement essentially so

00:56:25.670 --> 00:56:31.880
you can ask does the face does the face

00:56:28.940 --> 00:56:34.640
match her report does the face match

00:56:31.880 --> 00:56:37.700
somebody else's report do two people

00:56:34.640 --> 00:56:41.240
agree on what they see so you're using

00:56:37.700 --> 00:56:44.440
all kinds of basically perceiver based

00:56:41.240 --> 00:56:48.080
agreement which is basically consensus

00:56:44.440 --> 00:56:49.700
because no one has found the there

00:56:48.080 --> 00:56:52.100
is no ground truth when it comes to

00:56:49.700 --> 00:56:56.540
emotion that anyone has ever found that

00:56:52.100 --> 00:56:57.530
replicates from study to study and so

00:56:56.540 --> 00:56:58.790
there's a part of you that wants to say

00:56:57.530 --> 00:56:59.690
I can't even answer your question

00:56:58.790 --> 00:57:01.160
because I think it's not even a

00:56:59.690 --> 00:57:03.410
scientific question that's answerable

00:57:01.160 --> 00:57:05.210
but we can answer it in other ways

00:57:03.410 --> 00:57:07.010
by looking at various forms of

00:57:05.210 --> 00:57:08.750
consensus and while I can't say anything

00:57:07.010 --> 00:57:11.000
about Serena Williams and what she

00:57:08.750 --> 00:57:13.040
experienced I can say that in other

00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:15.320
studies it's very clear that people are

00:57:13.040 --> 00:57:17.810
scowling absolutely when they are not

00:57:15.320 --> 00:57:20.390
angry my husband this is my husband Dan

00:57:17.810 --> 00:57:21.100
Barrett who works for Google sorry honey

00:57:20.390 --> 00:57:23.750
I'm gonna out you

00:57:21.100 --> 00:57:27.050
you know he gives a full-on

00:57:23.750 --> 00:57:29.720
facial scowl when he is concentrating

00:57:27.050 --> 00:57:32.150
really hard and it was only after I

00:57:29.720 --> 00:57:34.040
learned that that I was telling my

00:57:32.150 --> 00:57:35.480
students actually like can you believe

00:57:34.040 --> 00:57:37.010
and they're like can we believe it we

00:57:35.480 --> 00:57:38.329
experience it every time we give a

00:57:37.010 --> 00:57:41.119
presentation in front of you

00:57:38.329 --> 00:57:42.920
right so I'm sitting there you know

00:57:41.119 --> 00:57:45.439
paying a lot of attention to every

00:57:42.920 --> 00:57:47.239
single thing they say and they think oh

00:57:45.439 --> 00:57:50.749
my god she hates it

00:57:47.239 --> 00:57:53.329
and the whole you know emotional climate

00:57:50.749 --> 00:57:56.209
in my lab changed the the moment I

00:57:53.329 --> 00:57:57.709
realized that so so that you know that's

00:57:56.209 --> 00:58:00.650
an anecdote but it's an anecdote that

00:57:57.709 --> 00:58:03.079
reflects what is in the literature which

00:58:00.650 --> 00:58:04.939
is that people are making a variety of

00:58:03.079 --> 00:58:06.619
facial I'm not saying it's random I'm

00:58:04.939 --> 00:58:08.119
saying there's a pattern there are

00:58:06.619 --> 00:58:09.619
patterns there that we haven't really

00:58:08.119 --> 00:58:12.079
yet detected and I think it's in part

00:58:09.619 --> 00:58:13.729
because we are measuring individual

00:58:12.079 --> 00:58:15.679
signals or we think we're doing really

00:58:13.729 --> 00:58:18.410
well if we measure the face and the body

00:58:15.679 --> 00:58:20.179
or we measure the face and acoustics or

00:58:18.410 --> 00:58:22.910
we measure the face and something about

00:58:20.179 --> 00:58:25.459
you know maybe heart rate but we pick

00:58:22.910 --> 00:58:26.449
you know we pick up two channels instead

00:58:25.459 --> 00:58:28.179
of doing something really high

00:58:26.449 --> 00:58:31.160
dimensional I'm not saying there's no

00:58:28.179 --> 00:58:32.749
meaning there if there was if that were

00:58:31.160 --> 00:58:35.029
true we you know you and I couldn't have

00:58:32.749 --> 00:58:36.979
a conversation right now I'm saying that

00:58:35.029 --> 00:58:39.189
it's probably something high dimensional

00:58:36.979 --> 00:58:42.410
and it might be quite I idiographic

00:58:39.189 --> 00:58:45.199
meaning there could be different

00:58:42.410 --> 00:58:49.130
different brains maybe have the capacity

00:58:45.199 --> 00:58:51.529
to do a different number of categories

00:58:49.130 --> 00:58:54.109
to make different number of categories

00:58:51.529 --> 00:58:56.989
and that's also something I discuss in

00:58:54.109 --> 00:58:59.539
my book actually. so when you listed all

00:58:56.989 --> 00:59:02.479
the sort of pre qualifications for maybe

00:58:59.539 --> 00:59:04.519
emotion forming I was thinking you know

00:59:02.479 --> 00:59:06.619
a lot of vegetarians say oh you know all

00:59:04.519 --> 00:59:09.589
animals have feelings have this ability

00:59:06.619 --> 00:59:10.999
to emote and to feel emotion and a

00:59:09.589 --> 00:59:13.910
lot of meat eaters are like no no no no

00:59:10.999 --> 00:59:15.619
that's impossible they they don't do you

00:59:13.910 --> 00:59:19.160
have any opinions oh yes here's my

00:59:15.619 --> 00:59:22.099
opinion I think that I think everybody

00:59:19.160 --> 00:59:24.829
has to stop calling affect emotion like

00:59:22.099 --> 00:59:26.689
many many many problems disappear they

00:59:24.829 --> 00:59:30.499
just completely dissolve when we

00:59:26.689 --> 00:59:33.019
understand that every waking moment of

00:59:30.499 --> 00:59:36.529
our lives there's stuff going on inside

00:59:33.019 --> 00:59:40.609
our bodies and we can't we don't have

00:59:36.529 --> 00:59:43.549
access to the small every little small

00:59:40.609 --> 00:59:45.920
change in our bodies that gives that

00:59:43.549 --> 00:59:48.439
send sensory information to the brain if

00:59:45.920 --> 00:59:49.880
we did we would never pay attention to

00:59:48.439 --> 00:59:52.250
anything outside our own skins ever

00:59:49.880 --> 00:59:55.340
again so instead

00:59:52.250 --> 00:59:57.740
evolution has given us affect so we sense

00:59:55.340 --> 00:59:59.780
what's going on inside our own bodies by

00:59:57.740 --> 01:00:01.100
feeling pleasant or unpleasant feeling

00:59:59.780 --> 01:00:02.410
worked up or feeling kind of calm

01:00:01.100 --> 01:00:05.750
feeling comfortable or uncomfortable

01:00:02.410 --> 01:00:09.530
that's not emotion that's affect or

01:00:05.750 --> 01:00:11.960
mood that's with us always every waking

01:00:09.530 --> 01:00:13.430
moment of your life you have some affect

01:00:11.960 --> 01:00:15.650
there are some affective features to

01:00:13.430 --> 01:00:19.550
your experience and it's very likely

01:00:15.650 --> 01:00:24.080
also true of non-human animals you

01:00:19.550 --> 01:00:26.810
know I can say this circuitry is

01:00:24.080 --> 01:00:30.520
very similar similar enough that I think

01:00:26.810 --> 01:00:32.810
you could go down all the way to

01:00:30.520 --> 01:00:34.550
certainly all vertebrates and I would

01:00:32.810 --> 01:00:36.920
even guess that there are some

01:00:34.550 --> 01:00:38.780
invertebrates actually maybe all

01:00:36.920 --> 01:00:41.690
invertebrates I don't know even insects

01:00:38.780 --> 01:00:43.220
potentially could actually have affect

01:00:41.690 --> 01:00:44.840
although I think that's drawing I mean I

01:00:43.220 --> 01:00:46.490
might draw the line at like flies or

01:00:44.840 --> 01:00:48.380
something but but recently there was a

01:00:46.490 --> 01:00:50.480
study that came out that suggested maybe

01:00:48.380 --> 01:00:52.580
they do have affect so you know my

01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:54.100
feeling about this is I guess twofold

01:00:52.580 --> 01:00:56.780
one is I think we have to stop

01:00:54.100 --> 01:00:59.210
conflating affect and emotion

01:00:56.780 --> 01:01:01.220
affect just with you always even when

01:00:59.210 --> 01:01:03.200
you you experience yourself as being

01:01:01.220 --> 01:01:05.330
rational even when you experience

01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:08.120
yourself as just thinking or just

01:01:05.330 --> 01:01:11.480
remembering it's just that when affect

01:01:08.120 --> 01:01:14.240
is super strong our brains explain it as

01:01:11.480 --> 01:01:15.920
emotion once we make that distinction

01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:17.570
and we understand that distinction that

01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:19.520
emotions and affect

01:01:17.570 --> 01:01:21.770
maybe affect you could think of it as a

01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:25.700
feature of emotion it's actually a

01:01:21.770 --> 01:01:27.760
feature of consciousness then I think we

01:01:25.700 --> 01:01:30.470
can say without hesitation

01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:34.850
we don't know for sure whether non-human

01:01:30.470 --> 01:01:36.770
animals feel affect but they probably do

01:01:34.850 --> 01:01:39.470
and we should probably treat them as if

01:01:36.770 --> 01:01:41.150
they do that that solves a lot of

01:01:39.470 --> 01:01:45.110
problems it actually doesn't matter

01:01:41.150 --> 01:01:47.750
really from a moral standpoint whether

01:01:45.110 --> 01:01:49.280
an animal feels emotion it matters

01:01:47.750 --> 01:01:52.190
whether they can feel pleasure and pain

01:01:49.280 --> 01:01:54.230
that's enough actually it's an

01:01:52.190 --> 01:01:56.000
interesting scientific question whether

01:01:54.230 --> 01:01:57.830
or not they can they can their brains

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:59.780
can create emotion that's a whole

01:01:57.830 --> 01:02:01.250
different conversation but I think the

01:01:59.780 --> 01:02:03.500
answer to your question isn't really

01:02:01.250 --> 01:02:05.960
about emotion it's about affect and I

01:02:03.500 --> 01:02:09.140
think there it's really obvious that

01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:12.500
if you're gonna the smart thing to do

01:02:09.140 --> 01:02:13.760
you just want to do things where you do

01:02:12.500 --> 01:02:14.529
the least amount of damage if you're

01:02:13.760 --> 01:02:17.299
wrong

01:02:14.529 --> 01:02:20.599
right and so that means including

01:02:17.299 --> 01:02:22.099
animals in our moral circle right they

01:02:20.599 --> 01:02:23.900
can feel if you just assume they can

01:02:22.099 --> 01:02:27.289
feel pleasure and pain that solves a lot

01:02:23.900 --> 01:02:29.539
of problems. yep thank you so much for

01:02:27.289 --> 01:02:32.930
your time so you mentioned at the end I

01:02:29.539 --> 01:02:35.390
guess to answer the question if machines

01:02:32.930 --> 01:02:37.579
can experience motion that three things

01:02:35.390 --> 01:02:39.950
and the body was one of them and then

01:02:37.579 --> 01:02:42.650
earlier on or you also mentioned I guess

01:02:39.950 --> 01:02:44.500
one purpose to have to create emotions

01:02:42.650 --> 01:02:48.109
is like to know what to do next

01:02:44.500 --> 01:02:51.109
so my question is if a being without a

01:02:48.109 --> 01:02:53.329
body like a machine really needs that

01:02:51.109 --> 01:02:56.690
body element if the purpose of that

01:02:53.329 --> 01:02:58.390
being is different than just you know

01:02:56.690 --> 01:03:00.859
knowing what to do next

01:02:58.390 --> 01:03:03.680
therefore can we take that body out of

01:03:00.859 --> 01:03:05.559
the one of the three requirements based

01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:09.109
on a different purpose of that being

01:03:05.559 --> 01:03:09.829
that's a great question that is a great

01:03:09.109 --> 01:03:16.960
question

01:03:09.829 --> 01:03:19.279
so if the so can you give me an example

01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:21.380
we help me to help I don't have an

01:03:19.279 --> 01:03:24.200
example by the way I'm thinking when I

01:03:21.380 --> 01:03:30.529
hear machines yeah and you're modeling

01:03:24.200 --> 01:03:31.910
all based on in humans we have their

01:03:30.529 --> 01:03:34.789
purpose their emotions like we are

01:03:31.910 --> 01:03:36.440
creating them maybe at the beginning for

01:03:34.789 --> 01:03:39.380
survival maybe it's different social

01:03:36.440 --> 01:03:41.089
elements no but if you take the body we

01:03:39.380 --> 01:03:42.559
can still have a brain artificial

01:03:41.089 --> 01:03:46.130
intelligence without a body which is a

01:03:42.559 --> 01:03:47.960
different being or element therefore I'm

01:03:46.130 --> 01:03:50.510
questioning that model of three things

01:03:47.960 --> 01:03:54.770
needed yep to create emotion you know here's

01:03:50.510 --> 01:04:00.400
something you need to have so you'd need

01:03:54.770 --> 01:04:04.220
to have something that could tell the

01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:06.319
machine what it needs to pay attention

01:04:04.220 --> 01:04:09.500
to in the world and what it can ignore

01:04:06.319 --> 01:04:11.809
so value right so I mean let me back up

01:04:09.500 --> 01:04:13.549
and say it this way I mean I I don't

01:04:11.809 --> 01:04:16.279
know how else to think about it except

01:04:13.549 --> 01:04:18.740
in organic terms right but for example

01:04:16.279 --> 01:04:19.670
if you look at brain evolution if I were

01:04:18.740 --> 01:04:22.010
to say it really simply

01:04:19.670 --> 01:04:25.390
like super simplistically so I'm just

01:04:22.010 --> 01:04:29.720
glossing over like a ton of detail

01:04:25.390 --> 01:04:32.750
organisms first developed a motor sort

01:04:29.720 --> 01:04:36.470
of a rudimentary motor system with just

01:04:32.750 --> 01:04:38.480
a tube for like a gut that's it they

01:04:36.470 --> 01:04:41.390
used to just float around in the sea and

01:04:38.480 --> 01:04:43.490
kind of like filter food and it wasn't

01:04:41.390 --> 01:04:45.050
until the Cambrian explosion when there

01:04:43.490 --> 01:04:47.570
was a like a lot of oxygen and other

01:04:45.050 --> 01:04:49.910
things and so a lot of you know an

01:04:47.570 --> 01:04:53.420
explosion of diversity of life that

01:04:49.910 --> 01:04:55.220
predation developed and predation was a

01:04:53.420 --> 01:04:59.600
selection pressure for the development

01:04:55.220 --> 01:05:02.450
of two things sensory systems so these

01:04:59.600 --> 01:05:04.700
little like floating tubes had no visual

01:05:02.450 --> 01:05:06.500
system they had no rudimentary visual

01:05:04.700 --> 01:05:08.420
system or auditory system or they had

01:05:06.500 --> 01:05:10.550
no sensory systems they didn't

01:05:08.420 --> 01:05:13.940
really need them and they also had no

01:05:10.550 --> 01:05:17.330
internal nervous system to control

01:05:13.940 --> 01:05:19.490
any any systems inside because they

01:05:17.330 --> 01:05:21.740
didn't have any systems really inside

01:05:19.490 --> 01:05:26.720
except a motor system and a gut and that

01:05:21.740 --> 01:05:28.910
was it so they had to develop sensory

01:05:26.720 --> 01:05:31.730
systems but whether they're a predator

01:05:28.910 --> 01:05:33.890
or a prey most predators also are

01:05:31.730 --> 01:05:36.950
prey right so that they could they could

01:05:33.890 --> 01:05:38.690
sense they had to develop distance

01:05:36.950 --> 01:05:41.120
senses so they could detect what was it

01:05:38.690 --> 01:05:43.850
going to happen what was out there but they

01:05:41.120 --> 01:05:45.440
also had to figure out what was

01:05:43.850 --> 01:05:50.120
meaningful and what wasn't what was

01:05:45.440 --> 01:05:52.460
valuable because it's expensive to run a

01:05:50.120 --> 01:05:56.150
system and learn the two most expensive

01:05:52.460 --> 01:06:00.580
things that any human or any organic

01:05:56.150 --> 01:06:03.410
system can do is move and learn and so

01:06:00.580 --> 01:06:05.810
it means and so the development of the

01:06:03.410 --> 01:06:08.900
systems of the body sort of served

01:06:05.810 --> 01:06:12.710
the purpose of helping to determine the

01:06:08.900 --> 01:06:15.830
value to the organism now it turned out

01:06:12.710 --> 01:06:18.680
that you know along the way that those

01:06:15.830 --> 01:06:21.020
systems also developed sensation you know

01:06:18.680 --> 01:06:22.400
develop the capacity to send

01:06:21.020 --> 01:06:24.980
sensations to the brain which had to be

01:06:22.400 --> 01:06:28.180
made sense of if you completely demolish

01:06:24.980 --> 01:06:32.410
that and you say okay well you have a

01:06:28.180 --> 01:06:32.410
machine that

01:06:33.190 --> 01:06:39.970
its purpose isn't to sense things in the

01:06:36.490 --> 01:06:42.280
world and make sense of them then so

01:06:39.970 --> 01:06:44.319
that it can predict what to do next

01:06:42.280 --> 01:06:45.369
then maybe you don't need a body but

01:06:44.319 --> 01:06:47.109
then you're not even talking about

01:06:45.369 --> 01:06:48.280
something that is I don't even know I

01:06:47.109 --> 01:06:49.480
mean you'd have to give me an example

01:06:48.280 --> 01:06:51.819
for me to kind of reason through it in

01:06:49.480 --> 01:06:53.940
terms of the energetics and the I wonder

01:06:51.819 --> 01:06:58.539
if maybe body is throwing me off because

01:06:53.940 --> 01:07:00.220
like AI purpose can be also survive to

01:06:58.539 --> 01:07:01.990
exist and can be and I say just very

01:07:00.220 --> 01:07:03.670
simplistically need needs electricity

01:07:01.990 --> 01:07:05.619
or its connection to the cloud or

01:07:03.670 --> 01:07:09.579
something but that can be its body

01:07:05.619 --> 01:07:11.470
what's its function what does it do what

01:07:09.579 --> 01:07:12.849
do you mean like what like it

01:07:11.470 --> 01:07:14.049
doesn't just you plug it in and it

01:07:12.849 --> 01:07:16.930
doesn't just sit there it does something

01:07:14.049 --> 01:07:19.059
what's its function what does it do

01:07:16.930 --> 01:07:22.990
do you mean artificial intelligence what

01:07:19.059 --> 01:07:25.599
does it do well it's so you're saying

01:07:22.990 --> 01:07:27.250
okay it gets its energy from a plug I

01:07:25.599 --> 01:07:29.619
get that but what is it actually

01:07:27.250 --> 01:07:31.869
attempting to recognize or do or what's

01:07:29.619 --> 01:07:33.609
its function I mean we can use it for I

01:07:31.869 --> 01:07:35.559
don't know some industrial experience or

01:07:33.609 --> 01:07:38.250
maybe a self driving car AI for

01:07:35.559 --> 01:07:41.109
example and then what I'm saying is okay

01:07:38.250 --> 01:07:43.119
okay so it's driving a car it's driving

01:07:41.109 --> 01:07:44.559
a car for you it has to sense things in

01:07:43.119 --> 01:07:47.950
the world right and then the question is

01:07:44.559 --> 01:07:50.289
can can it experience emotion and then

01:07:47.950 --> 01:07:51.760
in your three model I agree with the two

01:07:50.289 --> 01:07:54.430
of two and I was questioning about the

01:07:51.760 --> 01:07:57.190
body and then maybe the body is what is

01:07:54.430 --> 01:08:00.220
reflecting body is its survival to

01:07:57.190 --> 01:08:01.960
create that value here's what I would

01:08:00.220 --> 01:08:03.640
say I would say okay well let's let's

01:08:01.960 --> 01:08:04.750
take this as an example I don't know I'm

01:08:03.640 --> 01:08:06.789
just doing this up down my head but

01:08:04.750 --> 01:08:08.410
let's take is an example so so sure you

01:08:06.789 --> 01:08:10.900
can just plug it in and it can get its

01:08:08.410 --> 01:08:13.690
energy from an electrical outlet but

01:08:10.900 --> 01:08:15.220
still you want to have an efficient

01:08:13.690 --> 01:08:18.609
machine that uses electricity

01:08:15.220 --> 01:08:20.440
efficiently and otherwise that would be

01:08:18.609 --> 01:08:23.739
like more expensive than it needs to be

01:08:20.440 --> 01:08:25.630
and so that means that you'd want it to

01:08:23.739 --> 01:08:27.580
do things predictively because that's

01:08:25.630 --> 01:08:29.290
actually more energy efficient that's

01:08:27.580 --> 01:08:31.480
why the human body doesn't care or

01:08:29.290 --> 01:08:32.830
actually any at all brains are

01:08:31.480 --> 01:08:34.750
structured to work efficiently not

01:08:32.830 --> 01:08:37.089
because of the the you know the

01:08:34.750 --> 01:08:39.880
the energy source there is glucose and

01:08:37.089 --> 01:08:41.500
other other organic sources so it's the

01:08:39.880 --> 01:08:43.509
same principle basically in fact

01:08:41.500 --> 01:08:45.460
electrical machines in fact the whole

01:08:43.509 --> 01:08:46.630
idea of predictive coding which is what

01:08:45.460 --> 01:08:49.630
I'm talking about

01:08:46.630 --> 01:08:51.790
from cybernetics and then human

01:08:49.630 --> 01:08:52.990
researchers who study humans were like

01:08:51.790 --> 01:08:54.850
oh wait a minute that actually could be

01:08:52.990 --> 01:08:57.070
really useful for explaining things here

01:08:54.850 --> 01:08:59.800
so you'd still want it to be super

01:08:57.070 --> 01:09:03.670
efficient presumably if it's driving a

01:08:59.800 --> 01:09:05.080
car it has to determine what's what it

01:09:03.670 --> 01:09:07.960
has to pay attention to and what it

01:09:05.080 --> 01:09:10.930
doesn't you can't be energy it can't be

01:09:07.960 --> 01:09:13.030
frivolous in its energy use

01:09:10.930 --> 01:09:15.100
right so it's got to be predictive and

01:09:13.030 --> 01:09:17.230
it has to basically not pay attention to

01:09:15.100 --> 01:09:20.080
some things and it probably has a bunch

01:09:17.230 --> 01:09:22.890
of systems that it has to keep in

01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:26.680
balance so that it's working efficiently

01:09:22.890 --> 01:09:28.750
that so far counts as there's nothing in

01:09:26.680 --> 01:09:30.550
there that actually violates anything

01:09:28.750 --> 01:09:32.560
that I've said I think I was trying to

01:09:30.550 --> 01:09:33.130
be really careful to say when I say a

01:09:32.560 --> 01:09:35.200
body

01:09:33.130 --> 01:09:39.130
I don't literally mean a flesh and blood

01:09:35.200 --> 01:09:41.740
body I mean one of your brain's basic

01:09:39.130 --> 01:09:45.550
jobs is to keep the systems of your body

01:09:41.740 --> 01:09:48.660
in balance and that requirement which is

01:09:45.550 --> 01:09:51.130
called a allostasis that requirement

01:09:48.660 --> 01:09:56.650
forces a lot of other things to be true

01:09:51.130 --> 01:10:02.380
about how the system works so if you

01:09:56.650 --> 01:10:05.260
want if you want AI to do anything like

01:10:02.380 --> 01:10:08.350
a human it has to be put under the same

01:10:05.260 --> 01:10:10.780
selection pressures as a human not

01:10:08.350 --> 01:10:13.300
literally with flesh and blood if

01:10:10.780 --> 01:10:15.550
however you're talking about a function

01:10:13.300 --> 01:10:19.360
that a human can't do or that isn't

01:10:15.550 --> 01:10:21.700
relevant to humans then nothing

01:10:19.360 --> 01:10:23.410
I've said is relevant to you probably at

01:10:21.700 --> 01:10:27.430
all right because we're only talking

01:10:23.410 --> 01:10:28.750
about about humans but could a car you

01:10:27.430 --> 01:10:36.300
could have could a computer that drives

01:10:28.750 --> 01:10:39.130
a car feel emotion maybe if it had

01:10:36.300 --> 01:10:43.540
sensory inputs that it had to make sense

01:10:39.130 --> 01:10:45.810
of but the problem is that I don't know

01:10:43.540 --> 01:10:50.050
that I would call that emotion because

01:10:45.810 --> 01:10:53.280
for humans we make a distinction between

01:10:50.050 --> 01:10:55.840
the brain makes a distinction between

01:10:53.280 --> 01:11:00.300
the sensations from the body and the

01:10:55.840 --> 01:11:00.300
sensations from the world if I were

01:11:01.530 --> 01:11:05.650
if there if you didn't have sensations

01:11:04.390 --> 01:11:08.080
from your body you you wouldn't have

01:11:05.650 --> 01:11:10.210
affect and so it just wouldn't be the

01:11:08.080 --> 01:11:14.980
same but I don't know I mean may I

01:11:10.210 --> 01:11:17.860
maybe I I can't really answer but maybe

01:11:14.980 --> 01:11:20.020
maybe actually can I try to kind of

01:11:17.860 --> 01:11:21.850
offer one idea that might combine you

01:11:20.020 --> 01:11:23.410
both yeah so what if emotion is just

01:11:21.850 --> 01:11:25.740
kind of heuristic for how your body

01:11:23.410 --> 01:11:27.880
feels like you don't have enough

01:11:25.740 --> 01:11:30.640
convenient power to process everthing

01:11:27.880 --> 01:11:33.160
you summarize it and machine in that

01:11:30.640 --> 01:11:34.840
regard would need the same heuristics if

01:11:33.160 --> 01:11:37.330
it's not allowed then it would be

01:11:34.840 --> 01:11:39.640
emotion so like either heuristic sorta

01:11:37.330 --> 01:11:43.030
like something is brought wrong and my

01:11:39.640 --> 01:11:45.550
views are off that can be in a way seen

01:11:43.030 --> 01:11:47.980
as emotions and for us it would be like

01:11:45.550 --> 01:11:49.810
something is off for me I feel pain you

01:11:47.980 --> 01:11:51.220
don't really know where pain is but yeah

01:11:49.810 --> 01:11:54.100
that's a signal field for deeper

01:11:51.220 --> 01:11:57.400
investigation right and might be one of

01:11:54.100 --> 01:12:00.100
the causes is I mean I don't believe our

01:11:57.400 --> 01:12:04.600
brain is a pinnacle of engineering at

01:12:00.100 --> 01:12:06.370
least no no like I correct me if I'm

01:12:04.600 --> 01:12:09.100
wrong but let's say the frequency of our

01:12:06.370 --> 01:12:11.980
neurons is like hundred Hertz a second

01:12:09.100 --> 01:12:13.840
so the bandwidth is really like limited

01:12:11.980 --> 01:12:15.720
and the only thing that gives us life is

01:12:13.840 --> 01:12:18.700
that you have like hundred billions and

01:12:15.720 --> 01:12:20.830
machine might not need that because

01:12:18.700 --> 01:12:24.520
they're frequency's like higher here I

01:12:20.830 --> 01:12:26.380
guess but right but I think it's maybe

01:12:24.520 --> 01:12:28.000
I'm wrong but it mean I think it comes

01:12:26.380 --> 01:12:30.940
down to a philosophical question like

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:32.830
okay so so a machine is driving a car

01:12:30.940 --> 01:12:34.480
would have sensory

01:12:32.830 --> 01:12:35.590
inputs that it has to make sense of and

01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:37.450
it would have to do it predictively and

01:12:35.590 --> 01:12:38.950
all of that but so it would have to have

01:12:37.450 --> 01:12:43.060
category would have to do ad hoc

01:12:38.950 --> 01:12:44.440
categorization and it would have to 

01:12:43.060 --> 01:12:46.030
maybe not but I think that would

01:12:44.440 --> 01:12:48.280
probably be efficient way to do it so

01:12:46.030 --> 01:12:50.740
it's making categories and it's

01:12:48.280 --> 01:12:52.480
perceiving things but so when does that

01:12:50.740 --> 01:12:56.380
become an emotion and when doesn't it I

01:12:52.480 --> 01:12:59.350
mean you could also ask that of humans

01:12:56.380 --> 01:13:01.090
right I mean we I mean I you know nobody

01:12:59.350 --> 01:13:02.380
asked me this question but you know like

01:13:01.090 --> 01:13:04.060
what is the difference between an

01:13:02.380 --> 01:13:06.340
emotion category and any other kind of

01:13:04.060 --> 01:13:07.960
category that a human can cat can develop

01:13:06.340 --> 01:13:09.760
you know any kind of any other kind of

01:13:07.960 --> 01:13:13.270
category that is of this sort which is

01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:13.890
ad hoc and of social reality and the

01:13:13.270 --> 01:13:20.920
answer is

01:13:13.890 --> 01:13:23.500
nothing nothing is different so you know

01:13:20.920 --> 01:13:25.120
in some ways it's a not a question I

01:13:23.500 --> 01:13:27.010
think that science can answer because in

01:13:25.120 --> 01:13:27.910
this culture we've drawn a boundary and

01:13:27.010 --> 01:13:29.410
we've said well these things are

01:13:27.910 --> 01:13:31.720
emotions and these things aren't there's

01:13:29.410 --> 01:13:33.310
something rat...they're thoughts and in

01:13:31.720 --> 01:13:37.750
half the world people don't make that

01:13:33.310 --> 01:13:39.520
distinction so is it possible to to

01:13:37.750 --> 01:13:41.380
develop categories you know to do ad hoc

01:13:39.520 --> 01:13:43.780
categorization to do a predictively to

01:13:41.380 --> 01:13:46.630
make sense of the world or sensations

01:13:43.780 --> 01:13:48.400
sensory input from the world without a

01:13:46.630 --> 01:13:50.920
body sure sure you could do it without a

01:13:48.400 --> 01:13:53.290
body but then it probably wouldn't be

01:13:50.920 --> 01:13:56.320
what we would call human emotion or what

01:13:53.290 --> 01:13:58.960
feels to us like human emotion but but

01:13:56.320 --> 01:14:03.220
of course you know it would be it could

01:13:58.960 --> 01:14:06.910
be similar I guess to the experiences

01:14:03.220 --> 01:14:08.520
that our brains can make but I I don't

01:14:06.910 --> 01:14:12.640
know I I have to think about it more

01:14:08.520 --> 01:14:15.340
actually my iPad is speaking to me I

01:14:12.640 --> 01:14:17.370
Thanks Lisa for a great great

01:14:15.340 --> 01:14:20.620
presentation I had a follow-up question

01:14:17.370 --> 01:14:22.900
do we believe that if the human brain

01:14:20.620 --> 01:14:24.970
and consciousness could process all of

01:14:22.900 --> 01:14:26.740
the interoceptive signals everything

01:14:24.970 --> 01:14:28.150
from the world all the percepts in real

01:14:26.740 --> 01:14:29.650
time so there's no bandwidth issue

01:14:28.150 --> 01:14:32.170
suppose the human brain could just

01:14:29.650 --> 01:14:33.250
process everything the first question is

01:14:32.170 --> 01:14:36.370
do you believe we would still have

01:14:33.250 --> 01:14:38.080
affect by the sort of simple state of

01:14:36.370 --> 01:14:39.940
where we are suppose we could just

01:14:38.080 --> 01:14:42.490
represent every piece of information

01:14:39.940 --> 01:14:44.200
coming and the follow-up question is

01:14:42.490 --> 01:14:46.570
that depending on their answer so that

01:14:44.200 --> 01:14:50.080
is how how how that relates to our

01:14:46.570 --> 01:14:52.060
notion of the emotional experience so in

01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:57.120
order though for us so for us to have

01:14:52.060 --> 01:14:59.080
high dimensional in order for us to have

01:14:57.120 --> 01:15:04.830
let me let me think about this for a

01:14:59.080 --> 01:15:07.570
second so if we could sense everything

01:15:04.830 --> 01:15:09.610
so our wiring changed right because we

01:15:07.570 --> 01:15:12.190
the reason why we can't is that we don't

01:15:09.610 --> 01:15:13.000
have the wiring to do it but would we

01:15:12.190 --> 01:15:19.390
have affect

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:22.060
I think yes I think we still would and

01:15:19.390 --> 01:15:24.130
I'll tell you why we would because the

01:15:22.060 --> 01:15:26.980
way the brain is structured it's

01:15:24.130 --> 01:15:29.830
structured to do dimension reduction

01:15:26.980 --> 01:15:32.980
and compression of information so if you

01:15:29.830 --> 01:15:36.820
were to look at the cortex and you were

01:15:32.980 --> 01:15:38.739
to sort of take the cortex off the

01:15:36.820 --> 01:15:41.050
subcortical parts of the brain and just

01:15:38.739 --> 01:15:43.270
lift it off like a and stretch it out

01:15:41.050 --> 01:15:46.060
like a napkin and you were to look at it

01:15:43.270 --> 01:15:49.210
in cross-section what you would see is

01:15:46.060 --> 01:15:52.180
that you go from primary sensory regions

01:15:49.210 --> 01:15:53.770
like primary visual cortex or primary

01:15:52.180 --> 01:15:56.680
interceptive cortex which is where the

01:15:53.770 --> 01:16:01.750
information from the body goes to there

01:15:56.680 --> 01:16:05.050
are a lot of little pyramidal cells with

01:16:01.750 --> 01:16:08.530
few connections which and the

01:16:05.050 --> 01:16:11.680
information cascades to the front of the

01:16:08.530 --> 01:16:14.200
brain where there are fewer cells which

01:16:11.680 --> 01:16:16.660
are much bigger with many many many

01:16:14.200 --> 01:16:19.330
connections but the brain is doing with

01:16:16.660 --> 01:16:21.430
all sensory inputs is it's doing

01:16:19.330 --> 01:16:28.660
compression it's doing dimension

01:16:21.430 --> 01:16:30.610
reduction that's how multimodal learning

01:16:28.660 --> 01:16:34.570
hap that's how really all learning

01:16:30.610 --> 01:16:36.460
happens essentially so I think it

01:16:34.570 --> 01:16:39.040
happens in vision it happens with

01:16:36.460 --> 01:16:40.900
audition and so I think even if we could

01:16:39.040 --> 01:16:43.630
have even if we had higher dimensional

01:16:40.900 --> 01:16:45.880
access to what the the sensory changes

01:16:43.630 --> 01:16:47.710
in the body I still think given the way

01:16:45.880 --> 01:16:49.210
that the cortex is structured we would

01:16:47.710 --> 01:16:51.550
still experience we would still have

01:16:49.210 --> 01:16:54.010
affect which basically affect is just a

01:16:51.550 --> 01:16:55.950
low dimensional representation of the
