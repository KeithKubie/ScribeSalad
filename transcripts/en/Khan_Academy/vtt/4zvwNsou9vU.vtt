00:00:00.636 --> 00:00:02.517
- [Instructor] We're told
that a certain mapping

00:00:02.517 --> 00:00:06.766
in the xy-plane has the
following two properties.

00:00:06.766 --> 00:00:09.552
Each point on the line y is equal to

00:00:09.552 --> 00:00:12.552
three x minus two maps to itself.

00:00:13.569 --> 00:00:15.938
Any point P not on the line

00:00:15.938 --> 00:00:17.771
maps to a new point P'

00:00:18.771 --> 00:00:22.509
in such a way that the
perpendicular bisector of

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:25.504
the segment PP' is the line

00:00:25.504 --> 00:00:29.220
y is equal to three x minus two.

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.031
Which of the following statements is true?

00:00:31.031 --> 00:00:33.283
So is this describing a
reflection, a rotation,

00:00:33.283 --> 00:00:35.025
or a translation?

00:00:35.025 --> 00:00:37.114
So pause this video and see
if you can work through it

00:00:37.114 --> 00:00:38.114
on your own.

00:00:39.181 --> 00:00:42.246
All right so let me just
try to visualize this.

00:00:42.246 --> 00:00:45.149
So, and I'll just do a very quick,

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.447
so if that's my y-axis,

00:00:47.447 --> 00:00:50.907
and that this right
over here is my x-axis.

00:00:50.907 --> 00:00:54.088
Three x minus two might
look something like this.

00:00:54.088 --> 00:00:55.969
The line three x minus two would look

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:57.339
something like that.

00:00:57.339 --> 00:00:58.686
And so what we're saying is,

00:00:58.686 --> 00:00:59.986
or what they're telling us,

00:00:59.986 --> 00:01:01.728
is any point on this
after the transformation

00:01:01.728 --> 00:01:03.539
maps to itself.

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.047
Now that by itself is a pretty good clue

00:01:06.047 --> 00:01:08.090
that we're likely dealing
with a reflection.

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:09.297
Because remember with a reflection

00:01:09.297 --> 00:01:11.434
you reflect over a line,

00:01:11.434 --> 00:01:13.245
but if a point sits on the line,

00:01:13.245 --> 00:01:16.310
well it's just gonna
continue to sit on the line.

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.167
But let's just make sure
that the second point

00:01:18.167 --> 00:01:20.722
is consistent with it being a reflection.

00:01:20.722 --> 00:01:23.508
So any point P not on the line,

00:01:23.508 --> 00:01:26.712
so let's see, point P, right over here,

00:01:26.712 --> 00:01:29.081
it maps to a new point P' in such a way

00:01:29.081 --> 00:01:32.308
that the perpendicular bisector of PP'

00:01:32.308 --> 00:01:35.489
is the line y equals three x minus two.

00:01:35.489 --> 00:01:37.115
So I need to connect,

00:01:37.115 --> 00:01:38.032
so the line

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:40.900
three x minus two,

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.525
y is equal to three x minus two,

00:01:42.525 --> 00:01:44.383
would be the perpendicular bisector

00:01:44.383 --> 00:01:46.890
of the segment between P and what?

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.002
Well let's see I'd have to
draw a perpendicular line.

00:01:50.002 --> 00:01:52.928
It would have to have the
same length on both sides

00:01:52.928 --> 00:01:55.598
of the line y equals three x minus two.

00:01:55.598 --> 00:01:58.524
So P' would have to be right over there.

00:01:58.524 --> 00:02:02.378
So once again this is consistent
with being a reflection.

00:02:02.378 --> 00:02:06.976
P' is equidistant on the
other side of the line as P.

00:02:06.976 --> 00:02:09.414
So I definitely feel good that this

00:02:09.414 --> 00:02:12.943
is going to be a
reflection right over here.

00:02:12.943 --> 00:02:15.358
Let's do another example.

00:02:15.358 --> 00:02:17.518
So here we are told,

00:02:17.518 --> 00:02:19.259
and I'll switch my colors up,

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:20.931
a certain mapping in the
plane has the following

00:02:20.931 --> 00:02:21.929
two properties.

00:02:21.929 --> 00:02:24.275
Point O maps to itself.

00:02:24.275 --> 00:02:27.131
Every point V on a circle C

00:02:27.131 --> 00:02:28.298
centered at O,

00:02:29.545 --> 00:02:32.796
all right, maps to a new point W

00:02:32.796 --> 00:02:33.713
on circle C

00:02:35.792 --> 00:02:39.716
so that the counterclockwise
angle from segment OV

00:02:39.716 --> 00:02:42.433
to OW measures 137 degrees.

00:02:42.433 --> 00:02:44.778
So is this a reflection,
rotation, or translation?

00:02:44.778 --> 00:02:48.330
Pause this video and try to
figure it out on your own.

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.560
All right, so let's see.

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.160
We're talking about circle

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.577
centered at O.

00:02:54.577 --> 00:02:55.807
So let's see, let me just say,

00:02:55.807 --> 00:02:57.595
so I have this point O.

00:02:57.595 --> 00:03:00.103
It maps to itself on its transformation.

00:03:00.103 --> 00:03:03.586
Now every point V on
circle C centered at O.

00:03:03.586 --> 00:03:05.420
So let's see, let's say this is circle C

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.789
centered at point O,

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:10.807
so I'm gonna try to draw a
decent looking circle here.

00:03:10.807 --> 00:03:12.665
You get the idea.

00:03:12.665 --> 00:03:16.125
This is not the best hand-drawn
circle ever, all right.

00:03:16.125 --> 00:03:18.981
So every point, let's
just pick a point V here.

00:03:18.981 --> 00:03:21.651
So let's say that that is the point V,

00:03:21.651 --> 00:03:24.786
on a circle centered at
O maps to a new point W

00:03:24.786 --> 00:03:26.434
on the circle C.

00:03:26.434 --> 00:03:28.803
So maybe it maps to a new point W on,

00:03:28.803 --> 00:03:30.242
actually let me keep reading,

00:03:30.242 --> 00:03:33.958
W on circle C so that the
counterclockwise angle

00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:35.041
from OV to OW

00:03:36.442 --> 00:03:38.671
measures 137 degrees.

00:03:38.671 --> 00:03:41.921
Okay so we wanna know the angle from OV

00:03:42.781 --> 00:03:45.114
to OW going counterclockwise

00:03:45.962 --> 00:03:47.212
is 137 degrees.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.510
So this right over here is 137 degrees.

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:57.201
And so this would be the segment OW.

00:03:57.201 --> 00:03:59.871
W would go right over there.

00:03:59.871 --> 00:04:02.541
And so what this looks like is well

00:04:02.541 --> 00:04:05.003
if we're talking about angles

00:04:05.003 --> 00:04:07.580
and we are rotating something,

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:09.531
this point corresponds to this point,

00:04:09.531 --> 00:04:12.062
it's essentially the
point has been rotated

00:04:12.062 --> 00:04:13.229
by 137 degrees

00:04:14.337 --> 00:04:15.587
around point O.

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:20.562
So this right over here
is clearly a rotation.

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:22.696
This is a rotation.

00:04:22.696 --> 00:04:24.391
Sometimes reading this language at first

00:04:24.391 --> 00:04:25.854
is a little bit daunting.

00:04:25.854 --> 00:04:27.317
It was a little bit
daunting to me when I first

00:04:27.317 --> 00:04:28.734
(laughing) read it.

00:04:28.734 --> 00:04:30.730
But when you actually just break it down

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:33.795
and you actually try to
visualize what's going on,

00:04:33.795 --> 00:04:35.165
you'll say well okay
look they're just taking

00:04:35.165 --> 00:04:38.370
point V and they're
rotating it by 137 degrees

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:40.204
around point O.

00:04:40.204 --> 00:04:43.594
And so this would be a rotation.

00:04:43.594 --> 00:04:45.761
Let's do one more example.

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:49.237
So here we are told,

00:04:49.237 --> 00:04:50.305
so they're talking about,

00:04:50.305 --> 00:04:53.881
again a certain mapping in the xy-plane.

00:04:53.881 --> 00:04:56.226
Each circle O with radius r

00:04:56.226 --> 00:04:58.966
and centered at x y is
mapped to a circle O'

00:04:58.966 --> 00:05:01.961
with radius r and centered at x plus 11

00:05:01.961 --> 00:05:03.878
and then y minus seven.

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:06.930
So once again pause this
video, what is this?

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:09.183
Reflection, rotation, or translation?

00:05:09.183 --> 00:05:11.667
All right so you might be tempted,

00:05:11.667 --> 00:05:13.037
if they're talking about circles

00:05:13.037 --> 00:05:14.291
like we did in the last example,

00:05:14.291 --> 00:05:15.499
maybe they're talking about a rotation.

00:05:15.499 --> 00:05:17.449
But look, what they're really saying is,

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:20.073
is that if I have a circle,

00:05:20.073 --> 00:05:22.557
let's say I have a circle right over here,

00:05:22.557 --> 00:05:24.392
centered right over here.

00:05:24.392 --> 00:05:26.969
After it, so this is x comma y,

00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:28.455
centered at x comma y.

00:05:28.455 --> 00:05:32.287
It's mapped to a new circle
O' with the same radius.

00:05:32.287 --> 00:05:34.191
So if this is the radius,

00:05:34.191 --> 00:05:36.629
it's mapped to a new circle
with the same radius,

00:05:36.629 --> 00:05:38.796
but now it is centered at,

00:05:40.228 --> 00:05:43.432
now it is centered at x plus 11,

00:05:43.432 --> 00:05:46.149
so our new x-coordinate
is gonna be 11 larger,

00:05:46.149 --> 00:05:50.166
x plus 11, and our y-coordinate
is gonna be seven less.

00:05:50.166 --> 00:05:52.627
But we have the exact same radius.

00:05:52.627 --> 00:05:54.926
We have the exact same radius.

00:05:54.926 --> 00:05:57.062
So our circle would still,

00:05:57.062 --> 00:05:59.361
so we have the exact same
radius right over here.

00:05:59.361 --> 00:06:02.356
So what just happened to the circle?

00:06:02.356 --> 00:06:04.144
Well we kept the radius the same,

00:06:04.144 --> 00:06:05.955
and we just shifted,

00:06:05.955 --> 00:06:08.649
we just shifted our center

00:06:08.649 --> 00:06:10.832
to the right by 11,

00:06:10.832 --> 00:06:14.249
plus 11, and we shifted it down by seven.

00:06:15.592 --> 00:06:17.565
We shifted it down by seven.

00:06:17.565 --> 00:06:20.259
So this is clearly a translation.

00:06:20.259 --> 00:06:22.697
So we would select that right over there.

00:06:22.697 --> 00:06:23.947
And we're done.
