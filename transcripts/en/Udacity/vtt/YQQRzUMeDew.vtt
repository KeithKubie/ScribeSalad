00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.270
Every child, including you, has two parents. A mom

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:06.910
and a dad, and each parent passes down one

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:10.130
copy of their chromosomes. Here, I've color-coded them for

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:13.190
you, to make it easier to see. Your blue chromosomes

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:15.580
came from dad, and your pink chromosomes came from

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:18.700
mom. In the same way that your parents gave their

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:22.310
chromosomes, one day, you're going to pass down your chromosomes

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.230
to a child of your own. But the question is,

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.710
what will they look like? Now, because of meiosis, which

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.180
we learned about in Lesson five, recombination causes a parent's

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.720
chromosome pair to mix and match their information roughly equally.

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.610
So when you have kids, your chromosomes in your germ

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:43.060
cells, when they undergo meiosis are actually going to exchange pieces

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:45.550
of information, so that no longer do you have these

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.530
discrete individual chromosomes, the set you got from mom and

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:50.390
the set you got from dad, but you're going to mix and

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.550
match the information you got from mom and dad

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.830
on the chromosomes. So the chromosomes that you pass down

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:58.570
to your child will actually be a mix and

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.950
match of your own parents' chromosomes that they gave to

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:06.210
you. But every time recombination happens during meiosis for

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.190
each of your germ cells, every time a new sex

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:13.380
cell or gamete is made, a different recombination happens. And

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.660
the set of chromosomes that you pass down to one

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:18.446
child will actually be a different mix and

00:01:18.446 --> 00:01:20.910
match of your own parents' chromosomes, then another

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:24.040
child you pass down those chromosomes to. There

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.740
are virtually an infinite number of combinations for this

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.420
to happen. So, even though each of these

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.530
children is receiving half of their chromosomes from

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.700
you, the parent, the half that you give

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.030
one child is roughly only about half the same

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.900
as the set you give to the other child. For any given parent, you and a

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.340
full sibling only share about 50% of the

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.440
same genetic information. Since it's the same for

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.110
both parents, together you're considered about 50% related

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.000
to each other, through both parents, because it's

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.390
about the same through individual parents. And it

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.200
all has to do with recombination. So over all,

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.650
we can look at identity by state.

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:10.870
So, understanding the effects of recombination and

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:15.390
the fact that a 50% relation between siblings, is not the same thing as

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.600
a 50% relation between parent and child. What would you assume if you found

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:25.490
a 100% relatedness with someone? Take a look at the answers and select one.
