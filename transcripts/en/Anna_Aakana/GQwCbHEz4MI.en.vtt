00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.540
So the other day my friend and I were walking down the street

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:03.960
when all of a sudden we heard

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:06.760
"Hey mama!"  You lookin' real fine, baby."

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:09.060
We both immediately turned around and said:

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:12.140
"Hey!  That is not nice!  That does not make me feel safe."

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:13.580
"What would your mother say?"

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.280
Whenever I discuss Catcalling with my male-friends

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:19.520
I'm often met with the same kind of response.

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.920
Aw, dude!  That's a sick compliment.

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.320
Honestly, I'd be flattered by that!

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.720
Yeah, but...it doesn't happen that often right?

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.460
And when I discuss Catcalling with my female-friends

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.060
we have the same kind of reaction.

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:34.980
"Ugh!  I hate it.  It's like how do you want me to react?"

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.240
It's so scary...I don't know you.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:39.540
I don't know what you're going to do.

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.540
You know, that's why I always carry weapons.

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:43.860
No matter what.

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.120
It was kind of scary how many of us had stories

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.820
about strange men following us around or catcallers

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.960
who wouldn't stop when you asked them to.

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.220
And this whole thing made me start thinking

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.880
what is the appropriate response to this?

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:57.280
Is it sarcasm?

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:57.980
(whistling)

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.440
Yes!  Finally, a man who wants to fuck me.

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:01.940
(ding!)

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:03.840
You know, I've been walking down the street for so long

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.160
just waiting for someone to tell me that.

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.160
So.  You wanna...have sex?

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.240
Oh!  Hell yea baby!

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.920
Baby?  Woah.  No no no.  calm down.  I don't even know you.

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.920
I don't even know if you're husband material.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:17.920
What!?  No!

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.720
Should I act grateful for this attention?

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:20.220
(gasps)

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:21.820
Thank you so much!

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.360
I'm so flattered that you find my genetics physically attractive!

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.500
I actually didn't have anything to do with it.

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.420
Let me call the real heroes so you can thank them

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.080
they'll get a kick out of it--one second.

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.840
Hi guys!  I have someone here who wants to say something to you.

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:35.640
Here you go!

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.000
These are the people you want to compliment.

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.100
He-hello?

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.780
Or maybe I should try to give them a taste of their own medicine.

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.700
You lookin' real fine baby!

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.460
Hey boy!  Give me your dick!

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:47.100
(gasps)

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.420
I said give me your dick.  Right now.

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.420
No!  No--anything but my dick!

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.100
Look, I know it's not just men who catcall.

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:56.480
Women are guilty of it too.

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:57.960
Here kitty kitty!

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.200
Here, kitty kitty kitty!

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.640
I'm gonna take you home, and love you

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.780
and pet you and snuggle you

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.300
for the rest of our lives.

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.080
If you're a person who does this, just know you look like an asshole.

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.100
Ok?  It's rude!  It's disrespectful!

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.660
You look super immature!

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.400
Next time you see someone you find physically attractive

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.580
politely ask them out or keep your opinion in your pants.

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.000
Otherwise, the next time you catcall

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.880
Hey baby!  (kissing noises)

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.420
Hey!  I actually have someone I'd like you to meet!

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.980
(gasps)

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:30.480
"Mom!?"

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.280
I raised you better than this!

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.780
No mom!  I'm sorry--it's not what you--

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.180
Ah!  Don't "Mom--I'm sorry--me!"

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.820
(whimpers)

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:38.600
I'm gonna make you sorry.

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:39.300
(whines)

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.300
Thank you for letting me know.

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:42.360
Get home.

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:43.040
