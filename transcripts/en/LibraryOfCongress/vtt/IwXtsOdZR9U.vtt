00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.730
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:19.320
[ Applause ]

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.620
&gt;&gt; Karen Gardner: Hi everyone.

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:21.920
I am Karen Gardner.

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.350
I'm a Senior Executive
Director for Reading Partners.

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:26.930
I actually am the Executive
Director for Washington DC,

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:28.810
but I'm here representing
my colleagues

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:30.530
across the country today.

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:33.290
And it's such a pleasure to be
with the Library of Congress

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:34.750
in the Center for the Book.

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:37.430
It's such an honor to be
recognized in this way

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:38.890
and to have the opportunity
to collaborate

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:40.190
with all of you today.

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.720
So as I get started, I'd like
for you to just take a moment

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.580
and think about how different
your life would be today

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:52.250
if you had not learned
how to read proficiently.

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.550
Think about the opportunities
that you have been afforded,

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.000
your academic success,
your career achievements,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.640
the ability to know how
and where to get resources

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.610
for yourself and for your family
when you've really needed it.

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.450
The literacy crisis in the
United States for our children

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.260
and for adults is
truly an epidemic.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:21.200
We know that 20% of students,
fourth grade students

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.610
from low income homes
are currently reading

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.480
at grade level, only 20%.

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:28.150
That's one out of five.

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:31.180
And we also know that students
who are not on grade level

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.190
by the fourth grade are four
times less likely to graduate

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.700
from high school on time.

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.710
So that's why I'm proud
to be at Reading Partners

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.320
where we are leveraging
communities across the country

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.140
to make sure that our
students are matched

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.640
with a cure for this epidemic.

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.820
We work with 14 cities
across the United States.

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.520
And this past year we
served over 11,000 students

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.740
with its individualized
proven model.

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.470
So how does it work?

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.790
First of all, we
partner with schools,

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:09.950
so we are an in-school program.

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:12.350
We have a reading center
in each of our schools

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.760
where we provide pullout
instruction, one-on-one,

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.520
utilizing community
volunteers as well

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.330
as a nationwide partnership
with AmeriCorps,

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.690
similar to the Minnesota
Reading Corps.

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.160
Second, we leverage
community volunteers,

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.080
as I mentioned before,
and this allows us

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.850
to multiply the resources that
we provide to the community.

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.660
And third, our program
is individualized

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.840
on meeting each student exactly
where they need to be served

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.280
in order to develop
their literacy skills.

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.190
And as a result, 83% of our
students this past year met

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.480
or exceeded their end of
year literacy growth goals.

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.690
So we know that our
program truly works.

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.020
And this has been proven

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:58.620
by three different
independent studies

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.660
that have been done
on Reading Partners.

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.520
The first was concluded
in 2014 by MDRC.

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.150
It was a gold standard
research study,

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.630
randomized control
trial study and showed

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.510
that Reading Partners
has a positive

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:13.640
and statistically
significant impact

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.810
on improving reading
proficiency.

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.170
And similar to this, APA,
not the APA where most

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:20.990
of us are familiar with
it but Augenblick, Palaich

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:25.330
and Associates has conducted a
study that's been multiple years

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.910
in Colorado, as we've
launched our program there,

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:32.320
that has also shown this
positive impact on students

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:34.470
who receive Reading
Partners in comparison

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:35.910
to a comparison group.

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:37.870
And this has been
particularly true

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:39.740
for English language learners.

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:42.380
And the third study that we
are in the midst of right now

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:44.710
through Child Trends in
the state of California,

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:46.990
we are in year one
of two, excuse me.

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:50.400
We just concluded year one
of two and found, again,

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.940
the same trend of improving
reading proficiency for students

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.730
that are receiving our program
in the state of California.

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:00.330
But what I'm particularly
excited about with this study is

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:03.710
that it's also showing
really positive results

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:07.930
in social-emotional learning,
which we believed was is

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:11.730
to be true given the fact that
we're connecting caring adults

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:13.640
with students, providing
that relationship.

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.040
However, now this
study is showing that.

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:17.420
It's just really
exciting to see.

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:18.720
Thank you so much.

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.560
And please let me know if
you have any questions.

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:22.860
Thank you.

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.440
