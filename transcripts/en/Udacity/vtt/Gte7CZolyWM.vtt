00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Now I'd like to ask you a couple of programming questions.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
These are completely optional, but if you did the programming in the unit,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
you might want to try these out.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
During the unit, you wrote a function that can compute the mean of a set of data.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I'd like to now ask you to write something a little different.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Write a function, mean, that can take a known mean of existing data--

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
in this case I called it current mean--

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
a count of the amount of data I have, and a new value

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and tell me what the mean is now.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:37.000
And so to call my mean function I'll just type in mean(currentmean,currentcount,new)

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
And we can see it gives me the correct answer of 9.0.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Here is the function, mean, that you'll fill in.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
It takes the old mean which we called current mean below,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
the number of observations--n--and the new value to be added--x.

00:00:51.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Insert your code right below the comment. Have fun.
