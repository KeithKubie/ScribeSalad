00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:01.780
How can you avoid becoming homeless?

00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:02.780
Easy!

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:04.920
Just.. don't do anything, ever.

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:12.180
Wait that can't be right...

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:16.570
Hey guys Tara here for Dnews - and if you've
ever visited any major city in America, then

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:20.050
you'd know that homelessness is a growing
problem here.

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.570
The city of San Francisco spends $200 million
every year trying to get homeless people off

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.090
the streets - and while many attribute their
lifestyle to laziness, drug addiction, or

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:34.620
a dwindling economy - a new study says that
traumatic brain injuries could be an underlying

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:35.620
cause.

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:40.621
A team of researchers at St. Michael's Hospital
in Toronto, looked at data from 111 homeless

00:00:40.621 --> 00:00:46.860
men ages 27-81, and found that almost half
of them had experienced a traumatic brain

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.270
injury at some point during their lives.

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:52.850
And 87% of them occurred before the men lost
their homes.

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.890
Some had sustained multiple brain injuries
- with assault being, overwhelmingly, the

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:58.540
most common cause.

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:02.760
Sports-related injuries and motor vehicles
collisions were also huge contributors.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.900
But for men under age 40, the #1 most common
cause of brain injury was a fall resulting

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.920
from drug or alcohol-related blackouts.

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.910
Now this brings up an interesting dilemma.

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:17.970
Because it's already been shown that traumatic
brain injury leads to aggressive behaviour,

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.659
violence, and impulsivity.

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:25.490
BUT, by the same token, aggression and impulse
control disorders increase the likelihood

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:26.950
of traumatic brain injury.

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:32.700
So it's kind of a chicken-and-egg situation,
where both problems potentiate one another.

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.470
Of course there's no arguing that these kinds
of injuries worsen pre-existing conditions.

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.760
A 2008 study from a different group, showed
that traumatic brain injuries increase the

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:46.619
likelihood of seizures, mental health problems,
drug problems, and overall poorer physical

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:47.619
health.

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:51.150
This challenges the notion that being homeless
is a conscious decision - but it should also

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:56.150
be a warning sign to parents whose children
have sustained traumatic head injuries.

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:00.421
Just because someone looks ok on the outside,
doesn't mean they are on the inside.

00:02:00.421 --> 00:02:02.480
And that's good advice for everyone.

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:06.140
