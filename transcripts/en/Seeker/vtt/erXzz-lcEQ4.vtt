00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:03.750
According to some scientists we’re losing
dozens of species everyday.

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.450
But is there hope for some on the brink of
extinction?

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:12.660
Hey guys, Julia here for DNews

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.160
Many scientists believe we are the middle
of the 6th great extinction.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.529
At the current rate of 100 extinctions per
million species per year, that’s a thousand

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:24.100
times worse than the natural rate according
to a study published in the journal Science.

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:28.289
And that rate could be even higher since there’s
so many species we still haven’t discovered,

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:29.980
and maybe never will.

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.690
To put it more simply, dozens of species are
blinking out of existence EVERYDAY.

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.020
One of the most high profile of those on the
brink of extinction is the subspecies of rhino,

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:39.820
the rare Northern White Rhino.

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:41.720
And when I say rare, I mean RARE.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:45.640
Recently one female in a Zoo in the Czech
Republic died after a cyst burst.

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.930
She now leaves behind only four other members
of her species, three females and one male.

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.480
While they’re still here, their group is
pretty much functionally extinct.

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.380
Which can mean one of three things.

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:59.399
Sometimes a species is considered functionally
extinct if it disappears from the fossil record

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.510
or there’ve been no historical sightings.

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.379
Sometimes functional extinction can mean a
species is too small or scattered to serve

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:06.689
its ecological niche.

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.039
But in the case of the Northern White Rhino,
they’re considered functionally extinct

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:11.929
because there’s not enough of them.

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:15.689
There’s simply too few to produce what is
called the “minimum viable population”.

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.909
They can no longer produce a viable gene pool.

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.499
An MVP is typically considered to be large
and diverse enough that there’s a 95% chance

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:25.210
that the species will survive over the next
one hundred years.

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.180
How that figure is calculated for each species
is typically done through computer modeling

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.450
that takes into account things like inbreeding,
catastrophes and random variations.

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.259
So species with a smaller population is more
vulnerable to catastrophes.

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.850
An oft cited number, to create a thriving
population, you’d need at least 50 members

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:42.099
to avoid inbreeding issues.

00:01:42.099 --> 00:01:45.450
But it’s different for different species
and different circumstances.

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.239
A species that’s growing and a species that’s
declining are going to have very different

00:01:49.239 --> 00:01:50.289
MVPs.

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:54.950
One study by the International Union for Conservation
of Nature found that an African wild dog population

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.789
of over 100 members could last at least 50
years, if protected from humans.

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:03.239
But a population of less than 20 didn’t
stand much of a chance.

00:02:03.239 --> 00:02:05.169
So it’s not looking good for the Northern
White Rhino.

00:02:05.169 --> 00:02:08.629
But it’s not like a species hasn’t come
back from the brink before.

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:12.590
Nearly a hundred years ago, Siberian tigers,
also called Amur Tigers dropped to around

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.140
30, now there’s over 360!

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.719
But perhaps one of the biggest hallmarks of
success is the Southern White Rhino.

00:02:18.719 --> 00:02:22.709
Over a hundred years ago there might have
been as few as 50 of the large land animal,

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:25.239
thanks to hunting for both meat and their
precious horns.

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:29.290
20 of those were taken into captivity and
scientists helped set the mood so they could

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:30.290
get busy.

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.250
Now, decades later, their numbers are in the
thousands, like 20,000 and are considered

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.980
one of the most abundant rhino on the planet!

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:37.980
GO SCIENCE.

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.750
So maybe it’s possible to save really endangered
species.

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.370
While humans have caused so much devastation
on biodiversity and ecosystems across the

00:02:44.370 --> 00:03:21.370
planet, we’re also their last hope.
