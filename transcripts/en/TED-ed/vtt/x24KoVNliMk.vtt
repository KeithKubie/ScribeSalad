00:00:08.524 --> 00:00:10.251
Hi, I'm Medium Invader

00:00:10.251 --> 00:00:12.911
from the classic video game Space Invaders,

00:00:12.911 --> 00:00:14.863
and I want to tell you a little bit

00:00:14.863 --> 00:00:17.677
about where video games came from.

00:00:17.677 --> 00:00:19.765
A video game is an electronic game

00:00:19.765 --> 00:00:23.442
that has an interface designed for human interaction

00:00:23.442 --> 00:00:25.024
on a video device.

00:00:25.024 --> 00:00:25.878
Simple.

00:00:26.677 --> 00:00:29.400
Video games are used by scientists,

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.212
the military,

00:00:30.212 --> 00:00:31.653
and people like you,

00:00:31.653 --> 00:00:35.013
and their evolution has spread across arcades,

00:00:35.013 --> 00:00:35.799
consoles,

00:00:35.799 --> 00:00:36.624
computers,

00:00:36.624 --> 00:00:37.556
smart phones,

00:00:37.556 --> 00:00:40.293
and all kinds of other electronics.

00:00:40.293 --> 00:00:42.778
These days video games are everywhere,

00:00:42.778 --> 00:00:45.050
but they were actually made in science labs.

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.030
In fact, the earliest U.S. video game patent on record

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:50.545
was in 1948,

00:00:50.545 --> 00:00:52.674
and at the time it was referred to

00:00:52.674 --> 00:00:56.036
as a cathode-ray tube amusement device.

00:00:56.036 --> 00:00:57.158
That's a mouthful!

00:00:57.158 --> 00:00:59.402
Some of the earliest video games include

00:00:59.402 --> 00:01:01.423
the Nimrod computer,

00:01:01.423 --> 00:01:02.888
OXO,

00:01:02.888 --> 00:01:04.260
Tennis for Two,

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.316
and my personal favorite, Spacewar!

00:01:08.454 --> 00:01:10.584
But none of these early video games

00:01:10.584 --> 00:01:12.316
were ever sold to the public

00:01:12.316 --> 00:01:14.303
because they were either too huge

00:01:14.303 --> 00:01:15.595
or too expensive

00:01:15.595 --> 00:01:17.756
to get out of the lab.

00:01:17.756 --> 00:01:20.447
This all changed when a man named Ralph Baer

00:01:20.447 --> 00:01:23.304
looked at his television screen and wondered

00:01:23.304 --> 00:01:25.393
how else it might be used.

00:01:25.393 --> 00:01:28.701
In 1972, Baer's idea to get video games

00:01:28.701 --> 00:01:31.481
out of the science lab and into the living room

00:01:31.481 --> 00:01:33.630
led to the release of a game console

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:34.906
called Odyssey.

00:01:34.906 --> 00:01:37.548
Odyssey allowed you to play a game on your TV.

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.721
At about the same time,

00:01:40.721 --> 00:01:43.736
two other people, Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney,

00:01:43.736 --> 00:01:45.482
were working on something similar

00:01:45.482 --> 00:01:47.727
in a little company called Atari.

00:01:47.727 --> 00:01:49.034
You might have heard of it,

00:01:49.034 --> 00:01:50.191
and even if you haven't,

00:01:50.191 --> 00:01:52.270
I'm sure that your Dad has.

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.057
Atari's first major game release was in 1972,

00:01:56.057 --> 00:01:58.086
an arcade game called Pong.

00:01:58.086 --> 00:01:59.717
It was an immediate hit,

00:01:59.717 --> 00:02:00.741
and it's credited

00:02:00.741 --> 00:02:03.263
as the first commercially successful video game.

00:02:03.263 --> 00:02:06.980
Atari then released a home version of Pong in 1974.

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:09.598
By 1978, competition between Atari

00:02:09.598 --> 00:02:12.114
and another game company called Midway

00:02:12.114 --> 00:02:13.048
was heating up.

00:02:13.048 --> 00:02:14.647
Midway had licensed an arcade game

00:02:14.647 --> 00:02:16.556
for the Japanese company, Taito,

00:02:16.556 --> 00:02:17.980
that put them on the map.

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.119
The game:

00:02:19.119 --> 00:02:20.860
Space Invaders.

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.126
It featured iconic actors, like me,

00:02:23.126 --> 00:02:24.529
and it went on to become

00:02:24.529 --> 00:02:28.275
the second highest selling arcade game of all time.

00:02:28.275 --> 00:02:30.171
Space Invaders also helped kick off

00:02:30.171 --> 00:02:32.846
what is known as the Golden Age of Arcade Games.

00:02:32.846 --> 00:02:34.213
In response, Atari followed

00:02:34.213 --> 00:02:36.970
with the release of the arcade game Asteroids,

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:38.217
which ranked sixth on the list

00:02:38.217 --> 00:02:39.989
of highest selling arcade games.

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:40.761
It was a good game,

00:02:40.761 --> 00:02:42.618
but it's no Space Invaders.

00:02:43.386 --> 00:02:46.551
By 1980, color came to arcade games,

00:02:46.551 --> 00:02:48.339
and this was also the year

00:02:48.339 --> 00:02:51.304
that another video gaming milestone was born.

00:02:51.304 --> 00:02:53.895
Pac-Man, created by the Japanese company Namco,

00:02:53.895 --> 00:02:55.973
was brought to the U.S. by Midway.

00:02:55.973 --> 00:02:57.234
Important to the spread

00:02:57.234 --> 00:02:59.134
of video games into popular culture,

00:02:59.134 --> 00:03:01.989
Pac-Man was a character that could be licensed.

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:04.826
It wasn't long before it had a song on the charts,

00:03:04.826 --> 00:03:06.445
a Saturday morning television show,

00:03:06.445 --> 00:03:08.680
and all sorts of other products.

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.798
In just a year, Pac-Man arcade games

00:03:10.798 --> 00:03:14.559
made over one billion dollars in quarters.

00:03:14.559 --> 00:03:17.731
Then, in 1981, a company called Nintendo

00:03:17.731 --> 00:03:19.888
started making waves in the U.S. video game market

00:03:19.888 --> 00:03:22.011
with their release of Donkey Kong.

00:03:22.011 --> 00:03:23.476
It was the earliest video game

00:03:23.476 --> 00:03:24.908
to have a story line.

00:03:24.908 --> 00:03:26.829
The story went a bit like this:

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:28.176
Donkey Kong is the pet

00:03:28.176 --> 00:03:30.304
of a carpenter named Jumpman.

00:03:30.304 --> 00:03:32.616
Jumpman mistreats his pet ape,

00:03:32.616 --> 00:03:34.315
so the ape steals his girlfriend,

00:03:34.315 --> 00:03:36.457
leaving the game player to assume the role

00:03:36.457 --> 00:03:38.909
of Jumpman and rescue the girl.

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:41.401
Jumpman was eventually renamed to Mario.

00:03:41.401 --> 00:03:44.352
Other iconic arcade games from the early 80s include

00:03:44.352 --> 00:03:46.238
Frogger,

00:03:46.238 --> 00:03:47.468
Dragon's Lair,

00:03:47.468 --> 00:03:48.986
and Mario Brothers.

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:52.212
Perhaps the last iconic game considered

00:03:52.212 --> 00:03:54.536
to be part of the Golden Age of Arcade Games

00:03:54.536 --> 00:03:55.579
is Double Dragon.

00:03:55.579 --> 00:03:57.609
It was the first really successful example

00:03:57.609 --> 00:03:59.386
of the beat-them-up genre.

00:03:59.386 --> 00:04:01.502
It was released in 1987,

00:04:01.502 --> 00:04:02.873
and, like Donkey Kong,

00:04:02.873 --> 00:04:05.762
it featured a damsel in distress storyline,

00:04:05.762 --> 00:04:08.376
a storyline common in many video games.

00:04:09.098 --> 00:04:11.715
By the mid-90s, the Golden Age of Arcade Games

00:04:11.715 --> 00:04:13.235
was coming to an end,

00:04:13.235 --> 00:04:14.540
and the home game console

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:16.318
was gaining in popularity.

00:04:16.318 --> 00:04:17.616
While arcade games continued

00:04:17.616 --> 00:04:19.617
to decline in sales over the years,

00:04:19.617 --> 00:04:22.321
the popularity of video games was merely beginning,

00:04:22.321 --> 00:04:23.226
and we'll talk about that

00:04:23.226 --> 00:04:24.232
and a lot more

00:04:24.232 --> 00:04:27.436
in part two of a brief history of video games.
