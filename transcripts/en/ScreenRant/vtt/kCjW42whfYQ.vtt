00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.001
Franchises are a major part of Hollywood�s
DNA, with several high-profile sequels coming

00:00:12.001 --> 00:00:16.240
out every year. Some audiences may wish for
the studios produce more original content,

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.090
but everyone has a favorite film series they
enjoy visiting over and over again. However,

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:24.019
there are instances where a movie shows the
potential to spawn a full franchise, only

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:32.750
for the follow-ups to never come into fruition.
Here are Screen Rant�s 10 Most Wanted Movie

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:34.340
Sequels.

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:35.949
Spaceballs

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:39.470
With Star Wars set to be a major player in
the industry once more, it�s the perfect

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:44.400
time to bring back Mel Brooks� classic spoof.
Unlike certain filmmakers in this genre, Brooks

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.680
understood how to make a spoof hilarious,
populating his film with memorable characters

00:00:48.680 --> 00:01:02.640
like Dark Helmet and Yogurt, quotable lines
of dialogue, and 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:10.010
a multitude of funny jokes. Thanks to movies
like Epic Movie and Meet the Spartans, modern

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:14.430
audiences view spoofs in a negative light,
but Brooks could easily revitalize interest

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.110
by poking fun at the new Star Wars films and
the many sci-fi classics that have come out

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.120
since the original with his strong comedic
sensibilities. May the Schwartz be with us.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.920
Daredevil

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.350
The Man Without Fear looked to capitalize
on the blossoming popularity of superhero

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:32.130
movies in 2003 with a film adaptation starring
new Batman Ben Affleck, but the critical and

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.370
audience reception was a major roadblock in
getting any sequels made. Fox even attempted

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:42.270
to organize a reboot a few times, but nothing
ever came into fruition, which is a shame

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.760
because the Daredevil world is so rich and
full of fascinating characters that make for

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.340
a good watch. With the Netflix series showing
that it is possible to get the hero �right�

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.000
on-screen, maybe Matt Murdock will be making
a return to the theaters in the near future.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.799
Inception

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:00.600
Even though it was just a standalone film,
Christopher Nolan�s dream-based heist thriller

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.490
certainly set up an interesting world with
unique concepts that seemed ripe for sequel

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.619
opportunities. The nature of the job for an
extractor even makes it easy to justify follow-ups,

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:12.920
since each installment could follow a band
of high-class criminals as they move on various

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.620
targets. Yes, Cobb did say that Inception
was his �last job,� but that hasn�t

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.879
stopped Hollywood before � and even if it
did, we�d settle for a prequel detailing

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:25.930
Cobb and Mal�s relationship before her death.
We�re willing to bet a few moviegoers would

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.030
as well.

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:30.499
Constantine

00:02:30.499 --> 00:02:34.629
As Warner Bros. looks to expand their shared
DC cinematic universe, one project looking

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:40.739
to get off the ground is Justice League Dark,
which would be great news for this character.

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:48.409
Though both the 2005 film starring Keanu Reeves
and the recent NBC TV show never took off,

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:51.469
Constantine is still a fan-favorite amongst
the comic book crowd and has a deep enough

00:02:51.469 --> 00:02:57.049
mythology to warrant a full franchise of big
screen adventures. With 300 comics in publication

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:01.201
and a plethora of supernatural villains to
do battle with, the expansive world of Constantine

00:03:01.201 --> 00:03:04.999
should be explored at least a couple more
times.

00:03:04.999 --> 00:03:07.129
Beetlejuice

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:12.440
Thanks to his Oscar-nominated role in Birdman,
Michael Keaton has revitalized his career.

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:17.790
With Tim Burton constantly talking about the
possibilities of a Beetlejuice 2, now�s

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.700
a better time than ever to move forth on this
delayed sequel. The original earned a dedicated

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:25.549
following thanks to its bizarre sense of humor
and creativity that made it stand out from

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:31.340
the crowd. And it would be wonderful to see
Keaton � who had limited screen time � in

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:36.650
his classic part once more in a meatier role.
Who knows where the story might go, but we

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:42.299
don�t think he�ll be hitting the Hawaiian
beaches any time soon.

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:43.949
The Goonies

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:48.150
Rumors of a sequel have been circulating for
years, but nothing has actually been produced

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.379
yet. It�s difficult to see why, since the
story of a group of kids outrunning dangerous

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:55.120
criminals and searching for lost treasure
(all in the name of helping their families)

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.790
is something that should be told more than
once. Like so many entries on our list, The

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:06.040
Goonies had several memorable characters we�d
like to see again, including Chunk and Sloth.

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:12.230
It�s true that the actors from the original
have all grown up, but it would still be a

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:16.740
blast to see adult versions of Mikey and his
gang come back together to go on another wild

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:19.160
adventure.

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:20.160
Gremlins

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.760
A sequel to this classic dark comedy was made,
but Gremlins is a brand that deserves a full

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:29.940
trilogy � especially since Gremlins 2 was
a little underwhelming. As long as the filmmakers

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:34.289
stuck with the original practical effects
instead of needless CGI, audiences would get

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:38.800
a kick out of watching Gizmo do battle with
Stripes again, and its Christmas setting makes

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.199
it one of the easiest properties to re-visit
many times over. With a remake on the way,

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:46.270
perhaps the Mogwai will be able to seize this
opportunity to become a sustained series,

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:50.750
particularly in the age of long-running horror
movie franchises.

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:52.690
Zombieland

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:56.169
Thanks to the success of things like The Walking
Dead and World War Z, interest in the undead

00:04:56.169 --> 00:05:01.620
is at an all-time high. So it�s a little
surprising that this 2009 action/comedy never

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:05.000
warranted a sequel, despite there being so
much potential. The film sports one of the

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.940
more memorable ensembles, with instant favorites
like Tallahassee, Columbus, Wichita, and Little

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:14.020
Rock trying to survive in the zombie-infested
world they live in. Zombieland certainly felt

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:18.610
like the beginning of something, as we feel
the characters have more stories for us to

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:22.520
see. With the Amazon streaming series not
getting past pilot, perhaps someone can finally

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:26.720
give this a proper follow-up.

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:28.840
Jumanji

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:33.599
Even with the tragic loss of star Robin Williams
in 2014, audiences would still like to see

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:37.159
a sequel to this fantasy adventure film that
captured imaginations everywhere when it was

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:40.949
released in 1995. The story involves placing
a board game�s players right in the middle

00:05:40.949 --> 00:05:45.500
of the action, forcing them to dodge many
obstacles like giant bees, safari hunters,

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:49.900
and carnivorous plants, creating exciting
and engrossing action sequences. The original

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:53.580
even ended with the tease of a follow-up,
showing to young girls discovering the game

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:56.970
on a beach, meaning that the intention was
always there for there to be at least one

00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:58.419
more film.

00:05:58.419 --> 00:06:01.110
Fight Club

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:04.530
Based on its ending, you�d think there�d
be no threads to pick up in a Fight Club 2,

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:08.990
as the Narrator and Marla seemed ready to
move on to the next stage in life. However,

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:12.419
that very premise has the potential to make
for a very interesting film and is already

00:06:12.419 --> 00:06:21.460
coming into fruition thanks to a comic book
series from the book�s author Chuck Palahniuk.

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:25.009
Told from the prospective of Tyler Durden
yearning to be unleashed, it centers on the

00:06:25.009 --> 00:06:29.240
Narrator trying to adjust to married life
with Marla and dealing with middle-aged suburban

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:36.439
boredom. Not the most original concept, but
with the talented cast and memorable characters

00:06:36.439 --> 00:06:38.580
back at it, many fans would happily sign up
for another go-around.

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:42.801
