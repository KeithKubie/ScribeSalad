00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.100
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: And a hush fell on the crowd.

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:09.100
[laughter]

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:12.879
So, welcome. Welcome. Thank you for hanging
on for us. Welcome to "Thank God it's Wednesday

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:18.490
Kitchen." I'm very excited. This is my kitchen.
We've had it brought in specially from Teddington.

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:21.180
And welcome to the Optimize Your Life event.
You've heard about Optimize Your Life?

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:27.270
You know what we're trying to do with this?
We're trying to make Googlers the happiest

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:33.640
and healthiest people at any company in the
world. And we've got a big task in our hands.

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.540
So let's go for it. Yay.

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:36.540
&gt;&gt;Audience: Yay!

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:37.540
OK. So, this is an event from the Food Team
in London. We love our food team and Adrian.

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:38.540
Cheer for Adrian and the Food Team.

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:39.540
[audience cheers]

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:48.590
And from the London Events Team. So welcome
to all of you in the room. We're also live

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.789
in 20 other locations around Europe, from
Aarhus to Zürich, from Accra

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:57.260
in Ghana to Stockholm, Dublin, Madrid, Copenhagen,
and all the usual suspects.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:17.500
So, welcome to everybody on the TV. Now what
you want is obviously for me to get out of

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:28.180
the way, 'cause this is a really special event.
You can see from the atmosphere in the room

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:43.050
just how much the excitement is here. Uh,
hello. Someone just got a call. One of Jamie's

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:46.049
crew's got a call, so, are you done?

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.530
&gt;&gt;Crew Member: Yeah.

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.500
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: OK, perfect.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.500
[laughter]

00:01:50.500 --> 00:02:01.540
So, today is all about the food side of things
and I'm really excited. Google started in

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:19.760
1999. And in 1999 is when the Naked Chef started,
too. So Jamie and Google have grown up a phenomenal

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.680
rate. Both of us have got big ambitions and
Jamie's an amazing guy.

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:33.349
Started at a pub, his parent's pub in the
pub kitchen, became the Naked Chef, practicing--.

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:43.170
Left school at 16. Left school at 16, no qualifications,
went to catering college, then Carluccio's

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:48.340
then The River Cafe. Best-selling cookbooks,
Fifteen Foundation, campaigning for healthy

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:57.250
food for school kids, taking on the food industry
in the US. This is one amazing guy. Ladies

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.480
and gentlemen, Jamie Oliver.

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:00.590
[audience cheers]

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:08.890
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: Hello. My God, there's a lot
of you. Cheers, brother, . Ah, the future

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:19.849
of England is in this room. My God. Thank
you. All of a sudden I feel very popular.

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:23.341
That's wonderful. You never know if anyone's
gonna turn up. Thank you very much. It's a

00:03:23.341 --> 00:03:26.819
real pleasure to be here.

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:34.599
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Well, Jamie, welcome to
Google. What do you make of it?

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:44.290
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: So far, so good. Lots of creative
thinking places. Lots of cool words. Lots

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:54.709
of lovely-looking people. And as you all know,
you're very important in today's society.

00:03:54.709 --> 00:04:01.930
You guys are the future of spreading things
around and all that sort of business.

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:02.930
[laughter]

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:11.270
I'm feeling a bit dated and old-fashioned
really, but we'll do a bit of cooking anyway.

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:21.400
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Like I say that, the future
of spreading things around. I think we might

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.340
change our slogan to that.

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:25.340
[laughter]

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:35.570
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: I think it, yeah. I do think--.
Look, I come from a campaign in the last eight

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:42.040
years I've dedicated to campaigning. And all
of you guys, the digital world, blogging communities,

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:47.070
it's so important now and getting feedback
from people straight away, getting support,

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:48.070
signing petitions.

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:55.710
Basically, I mean my job--well part of my
job--which I'm very good at is being a pain

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:02.860
in the ass and an agitator. So, you guys make
me better at that. So, thank you.

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:12.190
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: So, Jamie, before we get
started, there was one thing I wanted to ask

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:18.850
you 'cause I noticed that you really started
out with a bit of a profile in 1999, which

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:20.400
is really the time that Google started.

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:21.400
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: Yeah.

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:27.710
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: And you've taken on some
big challenges in your life--

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:29.570
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: Yes.

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:39.789
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: and have really tried to
change the world and that's some of the things

00:05:39.789 --> 00:05:55.930
that we'd like to do as well. What is it that
motivates you? What is it that took you from

00:05:55.930 --> 00:06:03.620
dropping out of school at 16 to taking on
the world's food industry?

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:15.110
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: I just--. I'm a big believer.
I just love food. I love what food does. I

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:20.580
think it's a wonderful leveler. I think it
brings people together. I've always found

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:26.880
food a wonderful excuse to bring people together
and have a good laugh, basically. For me,

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:30.860
personally, at school I was a really bad achiever.

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:51.440
I was a special needs kid. I never had an
opportunity at school to shine. But then through

00:06:51.440 --> 00:07:01.710
cooking, touching, feeling, tasting, being
able to create things, I found that I wasn't

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:17.479
bloody useless. Actually, I could be half
decent. And also, when I got out in the big

00:07:17.479 --> 00:07:23.220
wide world, I realized there was lots of other
people like me as well.

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:31.660
So, I'm very biased. I think life is short.
You eat three times a day. When I talk to

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:38.949
kids in schools and stuff, you sort of say,
"Look, it's about being streetwise." If I

00:07:38.949 --> 00:07:44.660
can get you to budget and save money and be
able to knock-out a quick meal in 10 minutes,

00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:48.319
20 minutes, 30 minutes, a lovely Sunday roast,
birthday cakes.

00:07:48.319 --> 00:07:58.289
If I can make your life taste better, if you
can have more fun doing it, if you can look

00:07:58.289 --> 00:08:02.949
good, if I can get you laid, if I can save
you some money--

00:08:02.949 --> 00:08:03.949
[laughter]

00:08:03.949 --> 00:08:12.440
But it's true. It's true. Girls, come on.
If a fellow can cook, is that not better or

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:13.440
what?

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:15.410
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Members: Yeah.

00:08:15.410 --> 00:08:27.820
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: I mean, if he was a bit of
a crap shag, you might say, "Well, he can

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:31.240
cook, though." You know what I mean?

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:32.240
[laughter]

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:36.010
So, you balance it out.

00:08:36.010 --> 00:08:37.010
[applause]

00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:45.150
But this isn't quite going the way you wanted
it, was it?

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:46.150
[laughter]

00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:48.470
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: You're spreading it around.

00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:49.470
[laughter]

00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:53.970
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: But when you can say to someone,
"Look, at the end of the day the second biggest

00:08:53.970 --> 00:09:00.380
bill of your life will be the money you spend
in a supermarket. And I think it's every £10

00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:06.220
spent in this country, £2 goes to Tesco's."
If you put it in perspective.

00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:17.120
So, I think if you can make people ten percent
more efficient at buying, not waste--. Forty

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:27.370
percent of what we buy gets wasted. So for
me, if you look at life, you can save hundreds

00:09:27.370 --> 00:09:35.850
of thousands of pounds and I'm sure you can
find good things to do with that.

00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:45.649
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: OK, good. OK Jamie, I think
what we would like to do is we've had some

00:09:45.649 --> 00:09:48.589
great video entries for the competition--

00:09:48.589 --> 00:09:50.060
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: Yes.

00:09:50.060 --> 00:10:03.510
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: to win a prize, which is
cooking right here right now with you.

00:10:03.510 --> 00:10:04.510
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: Right.

00:10:04.510 --> 00:10:11.750
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: OK. And our judges have
been in operation. And what we're gonna do

00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:20.810
is we've got all of our entrants sitting in
the front row. So, we're waiting to announce

00:10:20.810 --> 00:10:26.240
the winner. The winner will come up and cook
with you for a bit.

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:27.370
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: Lovely.

00:10:27.370 --> 00:10:29.630
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Which will be great.

00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:32.270
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: I have jobs. Many jobs.

00:10:32.270 --> 00:10:37.870
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: And then also, ladies and
gentlemen, Jamie is gonna do his live webcast

00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:45.100
from here as well this evening at 6:30. So
you're welcome to stay on for that if you

00:10:45.100 --> 00:11:02.950
want to. But we're gonna do some live cooking
right now. So, it's tense. We've seen all

00:11:02.950 --> 00:11:04.579
the videos.

00:11:04.579 --> 00:11:15.440
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: Do we get to see them, or
have you already been through?

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:24.291
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: We've been watching them
for the last half hour or so. So, we're all

00:11:24.291 --> 00:11:25.291
very familiar.

00:11:25.291 --> 00:11:28.589
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: Oh, so you've done those.
OK.

00:11:28.589 --> 00:11:37.770
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: OK, so the winner of the
Cook With Jamie competition impressed us the

00:11:37.770 --> 00:11:47.470
most with her authentic pasta in one pan.
It's Maria Barrera from the development team.

00:11:47.470 --> 00:11:48.760
[audience cheers]

00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:53.280
Come on up, Maria. Come on up.

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:57.170
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: There she is.

00:11:57.170 --> 00:11:59.760
[audience claps]

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:10.940
Maria. Congratulations. Welcome to the one--.
Are you Italian? Fantastico.

00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:11.980
[laughter]

00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:22.340
Bloody great. You could've picked me someone
that wasn't Italian.

00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:23.380
[laughter]

00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:24.420
Ciao.

00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:29.600
&gt;&gt;Maria: Nice to meet you.

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:33.750
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: Tutto bene?

00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:35.820
&gt;&gt;Maria: Si.

00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:46.190
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: Fantastico. OK. Where are
you from in Italy?

00:12:46.190 --> 00:12:52.770
&gt;&gt;Maria: I'm from a very small city west of
Rome.

00:12:52.770 --> 00:12:54.510
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: Nice.

00:12:54.510 --> 00:13:01.070
&gt;&gt;Maria: It's about two hours from Rome. The
city's so small, so.

00:13:01.070 --> 00:13:03.079
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: Lovely.

00:13:03.079 --> 00:13:05.769
&gt;&gt;Maria: I'm from Campobasso.

00:13:05.769 --> 00:13:09.130
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: Campobasso? Near Farfa?

00:13:09.130 --> 00:13:11.149
&gt;&gt;Maria: Near Farfa?

00:13:11.149 --> 00:13:13.160
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: Mmm.

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:15.180
&gt;&gt;Maria: Umm, no.

00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:23.570
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: Have you noticed all of a
sudden I've gone quite camp.

00:13:23.570 --> 00:13:24.570
[laughter]

00:13:24.570 --> 00:13:37.790
OK. Come on in, Tiger. We're gonna make some
pasta. I got this for my birthday. So I thought

00:13:37.790 --> 00:14:01.820
we'd go through this. It will add no relevance
to your life. But I thought it might be nice

00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:12.480
to see a gadget. So we've been playing with
it for a couple of weeks.

00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:20.620
Tiger, look at that. This is an original.
One of the first patented pasta machines.

00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:26.360
I've also got two pasta machines I'm gonna
give away as prizes to some lovely people

00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:40.140
with your gain today. But what we're gonna
do is we're gonna, me and you as a united

00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:51.810
front, we're gonna get this room excited about
pasta.

00:14:51.810 --> 00:14:53.490
&gt;&gt;Maria: Yeah.

00:14:53.490 --> 00:15:00.570
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: Now as you know, you've got
two types of pasta really. You got from the

00:15:00.570 --> 00:15:08.760
South you have more of a flour and water,
or semolina and water. So, that's your al

00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:18.329
dente pasta. And being generalistic, that's
more olive oil and seafood and al dente and

00:15:18.329 --> 00:15:21.060
stuff like that.

00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:36.100
And then, we've got the more Northern style,
which is egg and flour. This is what we're

00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:43.519
gonna do today. So, it's really, really simple.
We can do it by hand in a bowl, or we can

00:15:43.519 --> 00:15:49.389
just whack it in here. So, we've got--. Is
this 200 grams we've got in here? To one person,

00:15:49.389 --> 00:15:56.240
a hundred grams of flour. I mean, you can
see I'm looking a little bit phased now 'cause

00:15:56.240 --> 00:16:04.920
I never weigh it. Do you make-a the pasta?
Do you make pasta?

00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:05.920
[laughter]

00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:07.690
&gt;&gt;Maria: Sometimes.

00:16:07.690 --> 00:16:21.329
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: Sometimes. So, we got a hundred
grams of flour there. One egg, Tiger. We have

00:16:21.329 --> 00:16:33.290
a little pulse up. We're gonna get this going.
Now remember, in a bowl you can do this literally

00:16:33.290 --> 00:16:37.570
just by knocking stuff together. You're just
making Play-Doh.

00:16:37.570 --> 00:16:48.340
It's so simple. And it's a beautiful thing
to make. And I'll tell you why, pasta, you

00:16:48.340 --> 00:17:00.790
can see it coming together. It almost starts
to clean the bowl. We've really done nothing.

00:17:00.790 --> 00:17:14.090
I mean, I quite like this. It's a timing thing.
When you get home from work, you just go crack,

00:17:14.090 --> 00:17:18.020
crack, handful, handful, buzz, buzz. Put a
pan on.

00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:31.850
Get the kettle on. Get it out. You get the
little--. I'll have my pasta with cheese set

00:17:31.850 --> 00:17:40.250
up all the time. [imitates food processor]
Nice. So, but look. For me personally, as

00:17:40.250 --> 00:17:49.130
a non-academic person, it was a real moment
for me when you took something as humble as

00:17:49.130 --> 00:17:58.520
egg and flour--really, really cheap things,
right? And then you put them together and

00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:00.370
you make Play-Doh.

00:18:00.370 --> 00:18:08.110
And then you can flavor it. You can color
it. You can put pepper in it. You can put

00:18:08.110 --> 00:18:14.220
herbs in it. You can pound up basil. It can
go green. You can get mushrooms, whiz 'em

00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:20.320
up and make them go brown. You can put the
squid ink in it. You can change all these

00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:26.919
colors and then you can make all these different
shapes. Tagliatelle, tagliolini, pappardelle,

00:18:26.919 --> 00:18:30.340
come on, give them some names.

00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:32.049
&gt;&gt;Maria: Penne. Rigatoni.

00:18:32.049 --> 00:18:34.330
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: Penne. Rigatoni.

00:18:34.330 --> 00:18:36.610
&gt;&gt;Maria: Mezzani, orecchiette, fusilli.

00:18:36.610 --> 00:18:40.600
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: Fusilli, as you can see.

00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:41.600
[laughter]

00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:50.240
So, it goes on and on. For me, this was like
freedom. It's freedom. And what it meant was

00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:56.440
I can be creative and it meant I think, without
getting too soppy, the beauty of moving on

00:18:56.440 --> 00:19:04.890
with life and cracking on is about confidence,
self-esteem, and feeling good about yourself.

00:19:04.890 --> 00:19:14.990
And when you're told you're shit all the time,
when you get this little bad boy and actually

00:19:14.990 --> 00:19:21.160
you can knock out tagliatelle, pappardelle,
ling--, some beautiful fettuccine. You stuff

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:28.820
and oh, like good. So, it's a little, for
me and I'm saying to you, it's a little bubble

00:19:28.820 --> 00:19:34.110
of control and expertise that makes you feel
good about stuff.

00:19:34.110 --> 00:19:38.490
So, what we're gonna do is we've got our pasta
coming together here. Dead simple. And we're

00:19:38.490 --> 00:19:42.360
gonna make our pasta. We're gonna put it through
this ridiculous machine here. Now, if you

00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:46.980
wanna sit on our--.

00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:47.980
&gt;&gt;Maria: Me?

00:19:47.980 --> 00:19:48.980
[laughter]

00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:50.549
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: Yeah, of course. You won the
competition.

00:19:50.549 --> 00:19:52.740
&gt;&gt;Maria: You sure it's not gonna break?

00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:53.740
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: Huh?

00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:55.250
&gt;&gt;Maria: Are you sure it's not gonna break?

00:19:55.250 --> 00:19:59.070
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: No, no. You're in good nick,
darling. You'll be all right.

00:19:59.070 --> 00:20:00.070
[laughter]

00:20:00.070 --> 00:20:02.720
&gt;&gt;Maria: You want me to sit here?

00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:06.410
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: Yeah, of course.

00:20:06.410 --> 00:20:07.630
&gt;&gt;Maria: OK.

00:20:07.630 --> 00:20:14.610
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: Well you can do a handstand
if you want.

00:20:14.610 --> 00:20:15.610
[laughter]

00:20:15.610 --> 00:20:25.350
So, listen. What we're gonna do is we're gonna
extrude this pasta, OK? So we're gonna put

00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:39.320
this through there. Now, so kind of put it
in perspective. And you can basically wind

00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:51.809
it down and as it starts to come out, my darling,
as it pushes the pasta out, you can cut it

00:20:51.809 --> 00:20:53.740
into lengths like that.

00:20:53.740 --> 00:21:01.470
There's a sharp knife. Be careful. I'll leave
a little flour here. Now, the other thing

00:21:01.470 --> 00:21:17.929
is to be really simplistic about it. Crack
one egg. Handful of flour. Mix it up. When

00:21:17.929 --> 00:21:31.690
it comes together, use a full wine bottle
and just take little nuggets out. Roll it

00:21:31.690 --> 00:21:43.530
out. It takes seconds. You don't need this
kit. You don't even need a pasta machine.

00:21:43.530 --> 00:21:52.330
Roll it out. You can go as thin as you can.
And then you can roll it up with a bit of

00:21:52.330 --> 00:22:05.620
flour. Slice it up. And you've got beautiful,
rustic pasta. So here we go here.

00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:11.980
&gt;&gt;Male Helper: Nothing's come out yet.

00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:16.210
&gt;&gt;Maria: It's hard though.

00:22:16.210 --> 00:22:24.690
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: It will do. It will do.

00:22:24.690 --> 00:22:31.590
&gt;&gt;Male Helper: How long do you want it?

00:22:31.590 --> 00:22:42.040
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: What? How's it going? Have
you got--? Do you mind if I?

00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:43.559
&gt;&gt;Maria: Please.

00:22:43.559 --> 00:22:48.549
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: Keep going, Tiger. Go on.

00:22:48.549 --> 00:22:50.500
&gt;&gt;Maria: More?

00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:57.900
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: Go on, push. A bit harder.

00:22:57.900 --> 00:22:58.900
[laughter]

00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:00.059
Go on.

00:23:00.059 --> 00:23:02.940
&gt;&gt;Maria: Get this machine.

00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:09.870
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: It's coming out. Give it a
cut now. Don't worry.

00:23:09.870 --> 00:23:12.990
&gt;&gt;Male Helper: Can I cut now?

00:23:12.990 --> 00:23:15.580
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: Yeah, don't be nervous.

00:23:15.580 --> 00:23:21.270
&gt;&gt;Male Helper: All right. All right. Get it
all out. That's about right.

00:23:21.270 --> 00:23:24.890
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: It's all right. Go on.

00:23:24.890 --> 00:23:29.559
&gt;&gt;Maria: Wow. I'm not going to the gym tonight.

00:23:29.559 --> 00:23:31.280
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: All right.

00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:37.480
&gt;&gt;Male Helper: I think it says you're riding
side-saddle.

00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:46.450
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: Keep going. Keep going up.
OK. A bit longer. A bit faster. Can you go

00:23:46.450 --> 00:23:47.450
a bit faster?

00:23:47.450 --> 00:23:48.450
[laughter]

00:23:48.450 --> 00:23:49.450
&gt;&gt;Maria: I will try.

00:23:49.450 --> 00:23:52.460
&gt;&gt;Male Helper: Here we go. Another one. Let
me get it.

00:23:52.460 --> 00:24:02.600
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: There you go. And if you toss
that in pasta, we've got a lovely tagliatelle.

00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:03.950
I'll tell you what--.

00:24:03.950 --> 00:24:06.960
&gt;&gt;Male Helper: I think we screwed this right
up.

00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:07.960
[laughter]

00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:13.870
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: Bring it out. We'll put some
more flour in it and we'll have another go.

00:24:13.870 --> 00:24:27.210
We've got pasta. Push it all out. I think
it's a little bit soft. If you mix up some

00:24:27.210 --> 00:24:38.520
of that flour into it, just make it a bit
firmer and put it through again, we'll be

00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:40.690
in a good place.

00:24:40.690 --> 00:24:41.780
&gt;&gt;Maria: Sorry

00:24:41.780 --> 00:24:49.880
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: Now, that only takes 45 seconds
to cook, OK? So, I thought we'd make a really

00:24:49.880 --> 00:25:00.250
quick summer sauce. Dead simple. I did one
of these on my little--. We do these little

00:25:00.250 --> 00:25:11.350
live, we're doing one tonight. We do the little
webcasts. Two years ago, it would cost about

00:25:11.350 --> 00:25:21.490
a hundred grand and satellites and 30 people
to do it.

00:25:21.490 --> 00:25:34.660
And now, we do it with a couple of dudes,
a couple of phones, a computer, and out it

00:25:34.660 --> 00:25:47.760
goes. So, we're gonna do it. We did it the
other day. It's very simple. It's an uncooked

00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:56.400
pasta sauce. So, we're gonna crack on with
that. How's it going?

00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:58.340
&gt;&gt;Maria: Almost there.

00:25:58.340 --> 00:26:08.700
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: OK. Now, before we do this,
let me just think. While we're doing that,

00:26:08.700 --> 00:26:13.230
we're gonna knead it. Get it a bit firmer.

00:26:13.230 --> 00:26:15.480
&gt;&gt;Male Helper: Handle's come off.

00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:16.820
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: This?

00:26:16.820 --> 00:26:19.070
&gt;&gt;Maria: No, no, it's fine.

00:26:19.070 --> 00:26:24.770
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: Oh, the end off. That's all
right. What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take--.

00:26:24.770 --> 00:26:27.529
Is there any single girls in the audience?

00:26:27.529 --> 00:26:30.440
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #1: Yeah.

00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:32.770
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: Single girls.

00:26:32.770 --> 00:26:33.770
[laughter]

00:26:33.770 --> 00:26:35.799
Any single girls in the audience?

00:26:35.799 --> 00:26:36.799
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #1: Here.

00:26:36.799 --> 00:26:42.320
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: OK. Blonde lady, please stand
up. What's your name?

00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:45.250
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #1: Stephanie.

00:26:45.250 --> 00:26:52.870
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: Stephanie. Please come forth.
Give a round of applause to Stephanie.

00:26:52.870 --> 00:26:53.870
[applause]

00:26:53.870 --> 00:27:01.480
Now, don't be scared. I'll look after you.
Where did you come from?

00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:03.040
&gt;&gt;Stephanie: Ireland.

00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:06.950
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: Lovely. Where abouts?

00:27:06.950 --> 00:27:08.520
&gt;&gt;Stephanie: [inaudible].

00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:15.570
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: Lovely. Is that north or south,
excuse my ignorance?

00:27:15.570 --> 00:27:16.880
&gt;&gt;Stephanie: South.

00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:23.529
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: South. Lovely. Sit down. Any
single men in the audience?

00:27:23.529 --> 00:27:24.529
&gt;&gt;Audience: Woo!

00:27:24.529 --> 00:27:31.490
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: She's lovely. She's very foxy.
You're a chef, mate. Best to you. Any single

00:27:31.490 --> 00:27:35.169
men coming? We got one here. Anyone else?
Anyone else?

00:27:35.169 --> 00:27:36.169
[laughter]

00:27:36.169 --> 00:27:38.200
You can't be the only single man.

00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:42.110
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #3: He's the only one.

00:27:42.110 --> 00:27:43.110
[laughter]

00:27:43.110 --> 00:27:46.440
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: Are you straight? OK. Up you
come.

00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:47.440
[audience cheers]

00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:49.730
Nice to meet you. What's your name?

00:27:49.730 --> 00:27:50.730
&gt;&gt;Glenn: Glenn.

00:27:50.730 --> 00:27:55.809
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: Glenn? Sit down. Make yourself
known over there. We've got wine coming.

00:27:55.809 --> 00:27:56.809
[laughter]

00:27:56.809 --> 00:28:04.600
Don't you worry. We'll be all right. Now,
I'll tell you what we'll do while these guys--.

00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:06.210
How's it going?

00:28:06.210 --> 00:28:09.120
&gt;&gt;Male Helper: It looks better.

00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:10.120
&gt;&gt;Maria: Yeah.

00:28:10.120 --> 00:28:17.620
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: Beautiful. Lovely. Just put
a little flour in it as it comes out as well.

00:28:17.620 --> 00:28:25.010
That's nice. Have we got those cherries, lovely
Christina Scarabucci? Oh, cherry tomato. That's

00:28:25.010 --> 00:28:28.700
where we got it wrong. Don't worry.

00:28:28.700 --> 00:28:39.890
OK. So what we're gonna do is we're gonna
make these guys a little dish, OK? I'm gonna

00:28:39.890 --> 00:28:56.590
give them a quick dish while I muck about
with this pasta. It's a scallop dish. I'm

00:28:56.590 --> 00:29:03.159
just gonna get rid of this pan here. Sorry.
We've got an induction up here though, chef.

00:29:03.159 --> 00:29:10.761
You might have to help me with this one. Here
we go.

00:29:10.761 --> 00:29:22.470
It's working, I think. And I press--. No.
Could you just help me with that. I'm not

00:29:22.470 --> 00:29:33.010
very good with induction. I like gas and fire.
I'm not very good on technology. OK, so we

00:29:33.010 --> 00:29:34.680
have pasta here.

00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:35.790
&gt;&gt;Maria: Yes.

00:29:35.790 --> 00:29:44.140
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: Well done. That's on. So,
we're gonna make these lovely people a little

00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:46.610
dish. You like scallops?

00:29:46.610 --> 00:29:47.850
&gt;&gt;Stephanie: Yes.

00:29:47.850 --> 00:29:57.780
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: Nice. We got some champagne
there. We got some wine. So this is a lovely,

00:29:57.780 --> 00:30:09.000
quick little dish. I don't mean to make you
guys feel awkward. Don't worry about us lot.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:11.760
Do you know what I mean?

00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:12.760
[laughter]

00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:20.600
So, we got a pan getting nice and hot. We
got two things happening right now. We got

00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:21.600
some--

00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:22.600
[laughter]

00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:31.800
That's it. Cheers. I wish we had some romantic
music. So, darling, will you come over here?

00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:32.940
&gt;&gt;Maria: Yeah.

00:30:32.940 --> 00:30:42.210
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: What we're gonna do, if you
can get a pair of tongs and just get some

00:30:42.210 --> 00:30:56.970
olive oil in here. And just add some pancetta,
or smoky bacon go in there. About three rashers

00:30:56.970 --> 00:31:05.210
would be lovely. I wanna get some beautiful
scallops here.

00:31:05.210 --> 00:31:19.220
I don't have a corer. I'm just gonna score
them halfway down in a criss-cross. OK? Now

00:31:19.220 --> 00:31:31.039
this is for two reasons: to take on seasoning,
to cook quicker, but also to look beautiful

00:31:31.039 --> 00:31:44.010
as well. So, I wanna take those and then--.
Best friends, scallops are sweet and delicious.

00:31:44.010 --> 00:31:50.710
You could do the same dish with little pieces
of monkfish, exactly the same.

00:31:50.710 --> 00:32:02.440
You could do the same thing with prawns. I'm
just gonna cook them with some smoky bacon,

00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:14.770
or as you call it, pancetta. So we're go in
with the bacon. We got the olive oil. We're

00:32:14.770 --> 00:32:18.700
hoping that our induction pot actually works.

00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:20.380
&gt;&gt;Maria: That's three.

00:32:20.380 --> 00:32:27.679
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: Three. Beautiful. Three scallops.
Three bits of bacon. Now, lentils. Lentils

00:32:27.679 --> 00:32:40.130
is a funny one. You can take them dry. You
don't have to soak them. You can put them

00:32:40.130 --> 00:32:55.789
in a pan. You can cook them in about 15 to
20 minutes.

00:32:55.789 --> 00:33:03.880
Now, lentils aren't the sexiest thing in the
world. People get a bit miserable, boring.

00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:14.720
All you do is just put a little cherry tomato
in there. Cover it with water. When they're

00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:22.540
nice and soft and cooked, then the flavoring
begins, OK? So, what we're gonna do with this

00:33:22.540 --> 00:33:38.630
is we're gonna dress it almost like salad.
So we're gonna put in here some olive oil,

00:33:38.630 --> 00:33:44.890
lemon juice, and a load of chopped herbs.

00:33:44.890 --> 00:33:52.610
That's not so safe. We're gonna bring that
back up to the heat. You can see the bacon

00:33:52.610 --> 00:34:08.290
here. It's just getting nice and crispy. Hopefully,
you guys are starting to smell stuff in a

00:34:08.290 --> 00:34:17.169
little bit. That's on full whack. When I first
started, well, a long time ago when I was

00:34:17.169 --> 00:34:24.490
at college at Westminster, I was 18. The Roux
Brothers came and did a demonstration the

00:34:24.490 --> 00:34:27.820
first year these were invented.

00:34:27.820 --> 00:34:38.260
So, this is microwaves, not gas. And the Roux
Brothers were the most famous chefs in the

00:34:38.260 --> 00:34:44.919
country at that time. And they started to
cook and they burnt every dish.

00:34:44.919 --> 00:34:45.919
[laughter]

00:34:45.919 --> 00:34:53.491
And I feel for them because all these years
later, I still can't get me head around it.

00:34:53.491 --> 00:34:56.310
'Cause you can't see it. That's the beautiful
thing about fire. So darling, what we're gonna

00:34:56.310 --> 00:34:59.150
do is as soon as that starts getting some
color, we're gonna season up these scallops.

00:34:59.150 --> 00:35:08.510
Now, I'm gonna use lemons here. A little bit
underrated in the sense that we always chuck

00:35:08.510 --> 00:35:19.329
the skins away. So, if you can just do a little
flick of the lemon zest like that.

00:35:19.329 --> 00:35:20.329
&gt;&gt;Maria: There?

00:35:20.329 --> 00:35:28.250
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: Yeah, just from a height.
We're gonna season it also with some sea salt,

00:35:28.250 --> 00:35:32.690
Maldon sea salt. Anyone from Essex here?

00:35:32.690 --> 00:35:33.960
&gt;&gt;Audience: Yay.

00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:39.020
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: OK. It's just us then, darling.

00:35:39.020 --> 00:35:40.020
[laughter]

00:35:40.020 --> 00:35:54.200
The Maldon sea salt from Essex. And we're
turning the bacon over. It's starting to take

00:35:54.200 --> 00:36:03.780
on some color. Now, scallops, they only need
literally three minutes cooking. So, that's

00:36:03.780 --> 00:36:11.160
enough, Sweetheart. But they got beautiful
flavor in that zest.

00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:23.040
So, what we're gonna do is we're gonna angle--you
can see it just taking on color. I'm gonna

00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:30.589
angle the fat down this side and we're gonna
put the scallops, cut side down first in that

00:36:30.589 --> 00:36:32.839
lovely fat there, the smoky bacon fat.

00:36:32.839 --> 00:36:34.240
&gt;&gt;Maria: Like this?

00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:38.420
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Jamie, so we've got a couple
questions--

00:36:38.420 --> 00:36:40.291
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: Go for it.

00:36:40.291 --> 00:36:59.730
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: from the other end of the
telly. Can I ask you as we're going?

00:36:59.730 --> 00:37:05.231
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: Yeah, go to it.

00:37:05.231 --> 00:37:12.060
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Somebody from Dublin, Graine
in Dublin said, what do you think we should

00:37:12.060 --> 00:37:21.720
keep in our kitchens to make tasty, healthy
meals over the weekend? We get lots of lovely,

00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:27.369
tasty meals here in the week.

00:37:27.369 --> 00:37:33.730
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: Well, I think to be honest,
growing herbs wherever you live is wicked.

00:37:33.730 --> 00:37:42.280
Olive oil, lemon juice brings everything to
life, whether it's a simple piece of fish,

00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:55.510
batter it out. A simple cooked bit of chargrilled
in a griddle pan, chicken. So I mean for me,

00:37:55.510 --> 00:38:03.640
herbs, olive oil, and lemon juice and chili
are my life.

00:38:03.640 --> 00:38:05.850
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: That's it.

00:38:05.850 --> 00:38:15.950
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: Yeah, well it's they're so
good for you. If you have herbs in your life,

00:38:15.950 --> 00:38:24.700
you will be a healthier person. They all do
different things, but it's incredibly good

00:38:24.700 --> 00:38:27.950
for you. Some help you digest.

00:38:27.950 --> 00:38:38.510
Some are great for your liver. Some help you
thin your blood or speed up your endorphins.

00:38:38.510 --> 00:38:50.640
Chili’s speed up your metabolism by 25%
for about two hours after. So, great thing

00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:59.260
to burn out the energy, but also, it does
release endorphins, though you can kind of

00:38:59.260 --> 00:39:02.060
get high on it.

00:39:02.060 --> 00:39:03.060
[laughter]

00:39:03.060 --> 00:39:04.060
Which--

00:39:04.060 --> 00:39:06.550
&gt;&gt;Maria: I think the big one is--

00:39:06.550 --> 00:39:13.140
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: Beautiful. OK. So now, just
control this. You can see here, just turn

00:39:13.140 --> 00:39:21.130
that one over again, too. Just keep giving
it some love. This is hot. We're gonna put

00:39:21.130 --> 00:39:27.270
some olive oil in here. Now, olive oil.

00:39:27.270 --> 00:39:39.820
Good olive oil, not really for cooking, but
for finishing, dressings. When you finish

00:39:39.820 --> 00:39:49.400
a pasta dish or a soup or a stew, just a little
bit goes in like this. We're gonna put in

00:39:49.400 --> 00:40:01.160
some lemon juice like that. So, we're just
gonna treat this like a salad almost, but

00:40:01.160 --> 00:40:06.250
it's getting warm. And then we're gonna feed
our romantic couple over here. You can see

00:40:06.250 --> 00:40:07.530
it's getting very involved.

00:40:07.530 --> 00:40:08.530
[laughter]

00:40:08.530 --> 00:40:10.380
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Why did you pick him?

00:40:10.380 --> 00:40:11.380
[laughter]

00:40:11.380 --> 00:40:20.790
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: To be honest, mate, he was
my only choice, but you know. You never know.

00:40:20.790 --> 00:40:25.540
We could start a beautiful thing here.

00:40:25.540 --> 00:40:26.540
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Yeah.

00:40:26.540 --> 00:40:33.010
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: So, we're gonna go in with
some basil like that. Stir it in. The scallops

00:40:33.010 --> 00:40:47.710
are looking good, my darling. Let's get our
plate. Where is our plate? We're gonna go

00:40:47.710 --> 00:40:50.750
for a little bit of this. We have a little
taste.

00:40:50.750 --> 00:40:51.950
&gt;&gt;Maria: OK.

00:40:51.950 --> 00:41:01.210
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: You can take those off the
heat now, Sweetheart.

00:41:01.210 --> 00:41:09.130
&gt;&gt;Maria: Do you want those on the plate?

00:41:09.130 --> 00:41:22.000
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: Not quite yet, Sweetheart.
So we're gonna just mix this up.

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:26.770
&gt;&gt;Maria: I don't know what to do with this.

00:41:26.770 --> 00:41:35.400
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: You're all right. Yeah. Just
turn it off.

00:41:35.400 --> 00:41:37.829
&gt;&gt;Maria: OK.

00:41:37.829 --> 00:41:54.060
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: There you go. We have a little
taste. And you wanna balance the olive oil,

00:41:54.060 --> 00:42:14.170
salt and pepper, a little mint I think I put
in there as well, herbs. Vinegar is really

00:42:14.170 --> 00:42:27.240
good, actually. Vinegar and lentils is just
a little sweet. It makes all the difference.

00:42:27.240 --> 00:42:45.849
I'm just gonna chop it up. And then we'll
serve this up. Nice thing to make the len--.

00:42:45.849 --> 00:42:59.990
I always feel it's a bit of a link missing
with the lentils and the thing that really

00:42:59.990 --> 00:43:09.500
makes a difference is a little bit of yogurt,
or crème fraiche. So, that for me. A little

00:43:09.500 --> 00:43:21.300
bit like with rice is a beautiful thing. So,
I'm just gonna serve the lentils in here.

00:43:21.300 --> 00:43:33.890
Nice to put things like purple basil, if you've
got it. Stuff like, you can chop roquette

00:43:33.890 --> 00:43:52.609
in there as well. We're gonna go for our scallops.
Here. Very nice. Put that on top like that.

00:43:52.609 --> 00:44:04.119
And our bacon. So what was, any more questions
you got from your guys?

00:44:04.119 --> 00:44:13.079
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Yeah, sorry. Your campaign
in America had started to become quite successful.

00:44:13.079 --> 00:44:21.860
What can people who are around the world do
to join that campaign for example, against

00:44:21.860 --> 00:44:29.820
sales of flavored milk and some of the things
you've been campaigning against?

00:44:29.820 --> 00:44:39.470
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: Look, man. I mean, here lies
the thing. I have a really weird job. I have

00:44:39.470 --> 00:44:50.900
a really weird job. I mean basically, like
I said, I'm a storyteller on one hand. I write

00:44:50.900 --> 00:44:58.020
books, but really the TV bit is a story-telling.

00:44:58.020 --> 00:45:17.780
So, in my profession, people come to me and
give me stories and tell me about things that

00:45:17.780 --> 00:45:35.350
are right and wrong, whether it's Green Peace
or just regular people or kids or whatever.

00:45:35.350 --> 00:45:58.450
And then it's my job to go out and let everyone
know. And then the thing is we created this

00:45:58.450 --> 00:46:17.140
genre of the, a new genre, really, which is
campaigning TV.

00:46:17.140 --> 00:46:39.619
And I think it's really important these days.
I mean, creating TV that scares politicians

00:46:39.619 --> 00:46:53.690
to watch their back and do a good job. And
so much slips through the net. So, stuff like

00:46:53.690 --> 00:47:02.280
what we did in America, it's a really weird
one 'cause it was over two and a half months

00:47:02.280 --> 00:47:09.430
of hell. And everything went wrong. But the
story became about lack of transparency and

00:47:09.430 --> 00:47:10.430
not being at--

00:47:10.430 --> 00:47:11.430
[laughter]

00:47:11.430 --> 00:47:12.430
Good Lord. Things are looking up over here.
It became about lack of transparency, but

00:47:12.430 --> 00:47:24.740
of course, I know deep down that if I'm telling
a good story, when it goes on TV it all kicks

00:47:24.740 --> 00:47:37.099
off. And it did because the guy that ran the
food, the local schools, he was an idiot.

00:47:37.099 --> 00:47:48.849
Got fired, which is good. And here you go,
my love. So we've got some scallops. This

00:47:48.849 --> 00:47:51.069
is to share.

00:47:51.069 --> 00:47:52.550
&gt;&gt;Stephanie: Thank you.

00:47:52.550 --> 00:47:59.569
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: So we got the first dish.
Scallops and lentils, crispy bacon, a little

00:47:59.569 --> 00:48:27.190
creme fraiche. But it did start making--.
I mean, you should see the food in these schools.

00:48:27.190 --> 00:48:30.740
It's terrible. And it's actually worse than
it was in England seven years ago. And we're

00:48:30.740 --> 00:48:32.950
in transition, strangely, but--.

00:48:32.950 --> 00:48:33.950
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: So how can people like Darrin
in Cambridge, Massachusetts get involved?

00:48:33.950 --> 00:48:34.950
How can people over here get involved in the
campaign?

00:48:34.950 --> 00:48:41.730
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: Well, the thing to do really,
I mean that's where the web is great. Go to

00:48:41.730 --> 00:48:45.372
thefoodrevolution.com and sign the petition.
I'm trying to get it to a million before I

00:48:45.372 --> 00:48:46.372
take it to the White House. So, we've got
just over 700, 000 . And we need, how many

00:48:46.372 --> 00:48:47.372
employees you got at Google?

00:48:47.372 --> 00:48:48.372
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: About fifteen hundred in
London.

00:48:48.372 --> 00:48:49.372
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: Fifteen hundred?

00:48:49.372 --> 00:48:50.372
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Fifteen hundred? About six
hundred in here, I think.

00:48:50.372 --> 00:48:51.372
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: Well if you can get five,
ten of your mates to sign the petition, we'd

00:48:51.372 --> 00:48:52.372
get well on the way towards that end.

00:48:52.372 --> 00:48:53.372
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Who's up for that?

00:48:53.372 --> 00:48:54.372
[audience cheers]

00:48:54.372 --> 00:48:55.940
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: I mean it's all about stirring
the pot, really. It's all about--. I think

00:48:55.940 --> 00:48:56.940
the thing that I've tried to do in England
and America is sort of prove that--and it's

00:48:56.940 --> 00:48:57.940
what you do at Google, actually--is like,
if you've got, if you're promoting healthy

00:48:57.940 --> 00:48:58.940
food, healthy life, then you can learn you
can be productive.

00:48:58.940 --> 00:49:02.480
You can get on in life. Cool. So we've got
our first dish over here. You all right?

00:49:02.480 --> 00:49:03.480
&gt;&gt;Stephanie: Yes.

00:49:03.480 --> 00:49:07.480
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: You've got the champ and the
white wine. We should do the pasta, really,

00:49:07.480 --> 00:49:08.480
shouldn't we?

00:49:08.480 --> 00:49:09.480
&gt;&gt;Maria: Yes.

00:49:09.480 --> 00:49:16.510
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: 'Cause I'm sort of going well
out of order here. So, we have some pasta.

00:49:16.510 --> 00:49:24.130
I wanna put that water back on. Thank you
very much. I find myself going around the

00:49:24.130 --> 00:49:27.410
world always cooking in other people's kitchens,
which is always challenging to know where

00:49:27.410 --> 00:49:28.410
everything is.

00:49:28.410 --> 00:49:36.170
You know in your own kitchen you're like.
But let's get rid of this. OK. I wanna show

00:49:36.170 --> 00:49:37.170
you an uncooked pasta sauce. So lovely Christina,
if I may.

00:49:37.170 --> 00:49:39.020
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Jamie, while you're doing
that, people from the room have got some questions.

00:49:39.020 --> 00:49:42.490
If you want to ask Jamie a question, then
there's a mic in the center, there. If anybody's

00:49:42.490 --> 00:49:46.559
brave enough to step up and--

00:49:46.559 --> 00:49:50.630
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: Yeah, don't be afraid.

00:49:50.630 --> 00:50:00.559
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: have a go while you're doing
that. Some of us are parents, Jamie. You've

00:50:00.559 --> 00:50:01.559
got kids.

00:50:01.559 --> 00:50:02.559
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: Yeah.

00:50:02.559 --> 00:50:03.559
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: What do you do to get your
kids to think about eating healthily and eating

00:50:03.559 --> 00:50:04.559
sensibly?

00:50:04.559 --> 00:50:05.559
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: Well, nothing really. It's
just a natural part of what we do. We try

00:50:05.559 --> 00:50:09.250
and grow a few things. And they react really
well to that. We try and sit down at least

00:50:09.250 --> 00:50:11.349
twice a week as a whole family. And that is
profoundly important.

00:50:11.349 --> 00:50:12.349
You don't even have to buy anything. Just
walking your kid through a farmer's market

00:50:12.349 --> 00:50:15.500
twice a month for 20 minutes will make a profound
difference by the time that kid gets to 18.

00:50:15.500 --> 00:50:18.319
I mean, what you've got to understand from
my perspective, 'cause I don't know how much

00:50:18.319 --> 00:50:21.319
of the work you know that I do, but I don't
just go on talking about stuff.

00:50:21.319 --> 00:50:22.319
I'm in people's homes of all walks of life
in different countries. And the stuff that's

00:50:22.319 --> 00:50:23.319
really killing people, the stuff that's making
people lose their dad at like, 40, and there's

00:50:23.319 --> 00:50:24.319
a kid with no dad, which is very common, the
biggest killer in America and England is diet-related

00:50:24.319 --> 00:50:25.319
disease. And put it into perspective, 8% of
America die through homicide or gun crime.

00:50:25.319 --> 00:50:26.319
And over 60% are these diet-related disease.
So, the thing is if you think about the resources

00:50:26.319 --> 00:50:27.319
that the police have and then we can't even
get a decent meal in a school. So, that's

00:50:27.319 --> 00:50:28.319
the way I see the world. So, I suppose what
I'm trying to say is little thing--. As a

00:50:28.319 --> 00:50:29.319
parent, you don't have to do big grand things,
but I think enjoy food, do little things often,

00:50:29.319 --> 00:50:30.319
go down a farmer's market, let them choose.

00:50:30.319 --> 00:50:31.319
Let the kids make decisions. Growing stuff,
mate, I've never ever met a kid from anywhere

00:50:31.319 --> 00:50:32.319
that if you teach him how to grow something
they won't try it. So, just have fun with

00:50:32.319 --> 00:50:33.319
it basically.

00:50:33.319 --> 00:50:34.319
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: And you make your kids do
all the pasta twirly things and all that?

00:50:34.319 --> 00:50:35.319
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: Yeah. Daisy does. Poppy's
not so interested. She's a bit of a bookworm,

00:50:35.319 --> 00:50:36.319
but Daisy's all over it. I mean, she's eight
years old and she can do poached eggs, fried

00:50:36.319 --> 00:50:37.319
eggs, scrambled egg. She's on omelets. She's
like making smoothies. She's doing cappuccino

00:50:37.319 --> 00:50:38.319
and the frothing.

00:50:38.319 --> 00:50:39.319
[laughter]

00:50:39.319 --> 00:50:40.319
And she's really cheap labor. She don't cost
anything.

00:50:40.319 --> 00:50:41.319
[laughter]

00:50:41.319 --> 00:50:42.319
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: I'm going to go home and
have a word.

00:50:42.319 --> 00:50:43.319
[Jamie Oliver laughs]

00:50:43.319 --> 00:50:44.319
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: My darling, please.

00:50:44.319 --> 00:50:45.319
&gt;&gt;Maria: Yes.

00:50:45.319 --> 00:50:46.319
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: So this is just Sicilian pasta
that I learned. If we just take a little of

00:50:46.319 --> 00:50:47.319
the, just long strokes of the lemon. So, it's
lemon juice, a little lemon zest, mind your

00:50:47.319 --> 00:50:48.319
fingers, Sweetpea.

00:50:48.319 --> 00:50:49.319
&gt;&gt;Maria: I love it.

00:50:49.319 --> 00:50:50.319
[laughter]

00:50:50.319 --> 00:50:51.319
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: I'm gonna--. We don't want
any finger in there. What you can do--you

00:50:51.319 --> 00:50:52.319
don't have to--but just what I love about
herbs is you can take literally four or five

00:50:52.319 --> 00:50:53.319
leaves, put it in a pestle and mortar, and
the flavor that comes out of that is incredible.

00:50:53.319 --> 00:50:54.319
So, a pinch of salt and a little bashing of
the basil. Sorry, I know you're eating, but

00:50:54.319 --> 00:50:55.319
just bash that up for me, mate. Get that to
a paste. A bit of delegation going on here.

00:50:55.319 --> 00:50:56.319
And then what we're gonna do is balance parmesan
and olive oil. So, that's fine, sweetheart.

00:50:56.319 --> 00:50:57.319
If I can take that off of you.

00:50:57.319 --> 00:50:58.319
&gt;&gt;Maria: Sure.

00:50:58.319 --> 00:50:59.319
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: If you could pour olive oil
in there.

00:50:59.319 --> 00:51:00.319
&gt;&gt;Maria: Yeah.

00:51:00.319 --> 00:51:01.319
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: This is very good. Extra virgin
olive oil. If any of you are confused about

00:51:01.319 --> 00:51:02.319
olive oil, a lot of people are. So, OK. You
generally get what you pay for. But there's

00:51:02.319 --> 00:51:03.319
nothing wrong with the cheap stuff.

00:51:03.319 --> 00:51:04.319
The cheap stuff will be highly, highly filtered,
which means you probably can cook with it,

00:51:04.319 --> 00:51:05.319
not too bad, but not too hot for wok frying
but for cooking off prawns or stuff like that.

00:51:05.319 --> 00:51:06.319
Anything over a tenner is very good. Anything
cold pressed and over a tenner is gonna be

00:51:06.319 --> 00:51:07.319
pretty damn good olive oil. It's only good
for a year. Sorry.

00:51:07.319 --> 00:51:16.830
It's only at its best for about eight months
and then it starts to deplete. And really,

00:51:16.830 --> 00:51:17.830
you use really good oil as an ingredient,
not an oil. So, in my house I'll have a cheap

00:51:17.830 --> 00:51:18.830
oil for doing light cooking. I'll have like
a sunflower oil or a groundnut oil for like,

00:51:18.830 --> 00:51:19.830
wok frying or high-heat cooking. And then
the kick ass stuff, I use little by little

00:51:19.830 --> 00:51:20.830
for finishing things like this dish.

00:51:20.830 --> 00:51:21.830
So, I'm gonna squeeze in the lemon juice like
that. How's your bashing going? That's a very

00:51:21.830 --> 00:51:22.830
delicate way of doing it. Give it a good old
rattling, mate. Go on. Give it a good old

00:51:22.830 --> 00:51:23.830
bashing. That looks a bit dodgy, but there's--.

00:51:23.830 --> 00:51:24.830
[laughter]

00:51:24.830 --> 00:51:28.990
I think I'll take that away from you now.
It is only your first date after all.

00:51:28.990 --> 00:51:29.990
[laughter]

00:51:29.990 --> 00:51:30.990
Bless. Colorful lot here at Google. OK. Now
look. What I love is that tiny bit of basil

00:51:30.990 --> 00:51:31.990
is gonna make dramatic change to this dish.
So, my Italian princess, if you can come over

00:51:31.990 --> 00:51:32.990
here.

00:51:32.990 --> 00:51:33.990
&gt;&gt;Maria: Yeah.

00:51:33.990 --> 00:51:34.990
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: We're gonna put in a little
handful of parmesan cheese, freshly grated.

00:51:34.990 --> 00:51:35.990
I wouldn't buy the pre-grated stuff. Always
get the blocks. Olive oil in. And we're making

00:51:35.990 --> 00:51:36.990
a lemon, basil, parmesan, and good olive oil
slurry, right?

00:51:36.990 --> 00:51:37.990
And then I'll come back and show you how it's
gonna be good. Now hopefully, this is gonna

00:51:37.990 --> 00:51:38.990
come--.

00:51:38.990 --> 00:51:39.990
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: I've got a bit of a spiky
question from Dublin for you, Jamie, if you

00:51:39.990 --> 00:51:48.700
don't mind. Spiky question. This is from my
friend Pendo. She says, "I bought your book

00:51:48.700 --> 00:51:56.920
and made a couple of lovely meals. They're
really nice, but I find the title a bit misleading."

00:51:56.920 --> 00:51:57.920
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: Yeah.

00:51:57.920 --> 00:51:58.920
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: "Neither meal took the promised
30 minutes. Did you ever consider the less

00:51:58.920 --> 00:51:59.920
catchy '30-Minute Meals Only if You've Got
a Food Processor' title?"

00:51:59.920 --> 00:52:00.920
&gt;&gt;Maria: Hahaha
[crowd laughter]

00:52:00.920 --> 00:52:01.920
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: Umm.

00:52:01.920 --> 00:52:02.920
[laughter]

00:52:02.920 --> 00:52:03.920
Tell her to read the bloody introduction.

00:52:03.920 --> 00:52:04.920
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Yeah, OK.

00:52:04.920 --> 00:52:05.920
[laughter]

00:52:05.920 --> 00:52:06.920
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: No.

00:52:06.920 --> 00:52:07.920
[laughter]

00:52:07.920 --> 00:52:08.920
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: There you go, Pendo.

00:52:08.920 --> 00:52:09.920
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: Hello, my friend.

00:52:09.920 --> 00:52:10.920
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #4: I have a question
about buying stuff. For example, you mentioned

00:52:10.920 --> 00:52:11.920
Tesco before and this oh, 2% of all, 20% of
all sales come from Tesco.

00:52:11.920 --> 00:52:12.920
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: Yes.

00:52:12.920 --> 00:52:13.920
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #4: So I wonder, and
I have a friend who is buying stuff only like

00:52:13.920 --> 00:52:14.920
from farmer's markets and very like organic
stuff. How is--. What's your opinion on buying

00:52:14.920 --> 00:52:15.920
let's say, vegetables and natural stuff, not
processed stuff?

00:52:15.920 --> 00:52:16.920
But from Tesco, from Sainsbury's, from the
normal supermarkets. Is it, should it, because

00:52:16.920 --> 00:52:17.920
I cannot go to a farmer's market every Saturday.
It would take up too much of my time. So,

00:52:17.920 --> 00:52:18.920
is it OK to buy vegetables at--?

00:52:18.920 --> 00:52:19.920
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: Of course, especially here
in England. I think compared to many countries,

00:52:19.920 --> 00:52:20.920
there's been a lot changing in the last five
years. So, obviously buying British is great,

00:52:20.920 --> 00:52:21.920
but general welfare chicken, pork, is way
in excess of most countries.

00:52:21.920 --> 00:52:22.920
And loads of people would debate that, but
I'm a geek and I know it and I study it. Like,

00:52:22.920 --> 00:52:23.920
it's pretty damn high. So, I mean for me personally,
I shop in a supermarket. I get me every day

00:52:23.920 --> 00:52:24.920
bits and pieces and I also go some farmer's
markets as well. And I think it's nice to

00:52:24.920 --> 00:52:25.920
balance stuff and then using internet stuff
that's convenient, having stuff delivered.

00:52:25.920 --> 00:52:26.920
So I think it's a balance of all those things.
I mean, look. If you live out in the country

00:52:26.920 --> 00:52:27.920
and you got a local butcher and stuff, use
them, of course. But I think for modern day

00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:28.920
busy city people, it's quite nice to do a
bit of everything. And just balance it up.

00:52:28.920 --> 00:52:29.920
But at the end of the day, generally if you
go to a supermarket, there's always a choice--fairly

00:52:29.920 --> 00:52:30.920
high welfare and everyday basic stuff.

00:52:30.920 --> 00:52:31.920
So, you can buy in to whatever you can afford
or whatever you're into, really. But I mean,

00:52:31.920 --> 00:52:32.920
organics is really important but I think people
confuse organics as a way of producing food,

00:52:32.920 --> 00:52:33.920
not a standard. Yeah, it is a standard, but
it's really about not spraying it with any

00:52:33.920 --> 00:52:34.920
pesticides and bits and pieces like that.
And if it's an animal, it'll be twice as old

00:52:34.920 --> 00:52:35.920
by the time it gets, you know.

00:52:35.920 --> 00:52:36.920
So, it does cost more. So, a lot of people
do resent it, but I think for me personally,

00:52:36.920 --> 00:52:37.920
I love cooking at that level and being geeky
and it's all wild fish and everything's perfect.

00:52:37.920 --> 00:52:38.920
But the real, my job actually, is working
with people that have only got 50 Quid to

00:52:38.920 --> 00:52:39.920
spend on food a week for a family of four
or less. And so the question is what do you

00:52:39.920 --> 00:52:40.920
give to them?

00:52:40.920 --> 00:52:41.920
So really, it's turned into a bunch of ingredients
into some dinner. And it's a lot of ground

00:52:41.920 --> 00:52:42.920
meat and mincemeat and root vegetables and
trying to make classic things, like bolognaises

00:52:42.920 --> 00:52:43.920
and lasagnas and stuff that people like. So,
that's the priority. I mean, I think we have

00:52:43.920 --> 00:52:44.920
these centers around England called the Ministry
of Food Centres.

00:52:44.920 --> 00:52:45.920
We got about six. And we're gonna have fifteen
in Australia. We got two in the States and

00:52:45.920 --> 00:52:46.920
counting. And basically, it's free cooking
lessons for anyone that wants to go there.

00:52:46.920 --> 00:52:47.920
But it's really basic stuff that we're teaching
because I guess at the end of the day, most

00:52:47.920 --> 00:52:48.920
parents weren't taught to cook at school and
they're both working. So, that's what we're

00:52:48.920 --> 00:52:49.920
trying to do, really.

00:52:49.920 --> 00:52:50.920
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #4: Thank you.

00:52:50.920 --> 00:52:51.920
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: Cheers mate. Any more questions,
brother?

00:52:51.920 --> 00:52:52.920
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Any more questions from
the floor? So, I've got a question. We were

00:52:52.920 --> 00:52:53.920
involved with you on the Dream Teachers project,
right? And it was really inspiring and we

00:52:53.920 --> 00:52:54.920
had a whole bunch of teachers submit--

00:52:54.920 --> 00:52:55.920
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: Oh, yeah.

00:52:55.920 --> 00:52:56.920
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: videos on YouTube and win
prizes, which is great. What did you learn

00:52:56.920 --> 00:52:57.920
from that process? It seemed like a big journey
for you.

00:52:57.920 --> 00:52:58.920
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: Dream School?

00:52:58.920 --> 00:52:59.920
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Yeah.

00:52:59.920 --> 00:53:00.920
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: I don't know what's going
on with this pasta, sorry. I'm gonna have

00:53:00.920 --> 00:53:01.920
to fix this. Dream School for me was brilliant.
It was like, for me, it was an opportunity

00:53:01.920 --> 00:53:02.920
to sort of like, if you had a magic wand,
what would you do at school?

00:53:02.920 --> 00:53:03.920
If you didn't have any rules, if you could
make up the rules, what would you do at school?

00:53:03.920 --> 00:53:04.920
And that, of course, we had celebrity Olympic
gold medalists and stuff teaching the lessons

00:53:04.920 --> 00:53:05.920
and bits and pieces like that. But it was
an opportunity.

00:53:05.920 --> 00:53:06.920
Most of the teachers had done badly at school.
But what was amazing was, and I think the

00:53:06.920 --> 00:53:07.920
reason the program was valid, was that over
50% of all British kids graduate school with

00:53:07.920 --> 00:53:08.920
not five GCSEs of grade C or above. And therefore,
they can't go into university and they can't

00:53:08.920 --> 00:53:09.920
go in at higher education.

00:53:09.920 --> 00:53:10.920
So, I guess what the show was saying was half
of it were not working. So, shortly we should

00:53:10.920 --> 00:53:11.920
be teaching these kids a bit differently.
So, it was a bit controversial at times. Everyone

00:53:11.920 --> 00:53:12.920
thought we were there to knock the teachers,
but we weren't. It was really about saying,

00:53:12.920 --> 00:53:13.920
"Is there another way?" And certainly, personally,
I learned I think just as much as the students

00:53:13.920 --> 00:53:14.920
did.

00:53:14.920 --> 00:53:15.920
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: So you think there is another
way of having done that?

00:53:15.920 --> 00:53:16.920
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: Yeah. I definitely--. I love
the argument about what is education. What

00:53:16.920 --> 00:53:17.920
is it? What's the point of it? What is it
there to do? So, all right. We've got maths

00:53:17.920 --> 00:53:18.920
and English and it's really, really important.

00:53:18.920 --> 00:53:19.920
But like I know that if you don't do your
geography homework, I know you're not, you

00:53:19.920 --> 00:53:20.920
ain't gonna die young, but I know if you don't
learn about food, where it comes from, what

00:53:20.920 --> 00:53:21.920
it does to your body, you will die young.
Because at the moment, we got the first generation

00:53:21.920 --> 00:53:22.920
of kids that are gonna die at a younger age
than their parents.

00:53:22.920 --> 00:53:23.920
So, I guess I'm biased because I think the
sport thing and the food education thing,

00:53:23.920 --> 00:53:24.920
I think should be in every single school,
obviously. But I'm gonna attempt to cook this

00:53:24.920 --> 00:53:25.920
pasta. There's some that we did earlier that
I'm gonna unwind here. This is a tagliolini

00:53:25.920 --> 00:53:26.920
. So, oh is that boiling again? I do apologize
everyone.

00:53:26.920 --> 00:53:27.920
I'm a bit caught out on this technology. Boil
please. So we're gonna--. No. I think we're

00:53:27.920 --> 00:53:28.920
fine. Are you guys? Oh, you cleaned that off,
didn't ya? My God. All right. Let's do the

00:53:28.920 --> 00:53:29.920
next one. Me and my Italian darling, we are
gonna make this very simple pasta. If any

00:53:29.920 --> 00:53:30.920
of you guys wanna ask any more questions,
please come up to the mic. You can ask anything

00:53:30.920 --> 00:53:31.920
you like. There's nothing I won't answer.

00:53:31.920 --> 00:53:32.920
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #5: I had a quick question.

00:53:32.920 --> 00:53:33.920
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: Go for it, brother.

00:53:33.920 --> 00:53:34.920
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #5: So Ferran Adria
is taking 18 months off Sabbatical to inspire

00:53:34.920 --> 00:53:35.920
himself with cooking. Have you ever taken
Sabbaticals and gone and traveled the world

00:53:35.920 --> 00:53:36.920
to find really out-there ingredients and different
ways of cooking?

00:53:36.920 --> 00:53:37.920
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: Yeah.

00:53:37.920 --> 00:53:38.920
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #5: So can you just
talk about some sort of travel experiences

00:53:38.920 --> 00:53:39.920
that you've had with cooking?

00:53:39.920 --> 00:53:40.920
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: Yeah, sure. Well, I travel
a lot. And I meet a lot of amazing people

00:53:40.920 --> 00:53:41.920
and I'm always learning. I'd love to take
a Sabbatical. It'd be really nice. I will

00:53:41.920 --> 00:53:42.920
take a Sabbatical in a couple of years. But
I'm in a kind of--.

00:53:42.920 --> 00:53:43.920
I have a funny job. I'm responsible for 6000
staff and 20 restaurants and charities and

00:53:43.920 --> 00:53:44.920
all of their mortgages and their families,
and we're in a recession. And I think that's

00:53:44.920 --> 00:53:45.920
important right now, you know? And you know
as well, and I'm positive it's the same with

00:53:45.920 --> 00:53:46.920
you guys, but I'm blessed. I feel like I've
made good decisions over the last ten years.

00:53:46.920 --> 00:53:47.920
I've surrounded myself by clever, beautiful
people that have got my back. And when I'm

00:53:47.920 --> 00:53:48.920
in front of my guys, I'm inspired. We bang
ideas around and we sort of like, come back.

00:53:48.920 --> 00:53:49.920
And then we bang other things around and we
have a very creative job, whether it's building

00:53:49.920 --> 00:53:50.920
restaurants-- What does it look like? What's
on the floor?

00:53:50.920 --> 00:53:51.920
What's the experience? How do we greet? What
is the food? What's the price? What's the

00:53:51.920 --> 00:53:52.920
vibe? Or, write in a book, "How did he design
it?" What's the mentality behind it, or documentaries.

00:53:52.920 --> 00:53:53.920
And some of my best work that I do on TV,
I hate making. The documentaries is seriously

00:53:53.920 --> 00:53:54.920
like a colonic irrigation. It's terrible.

00:53:54.920 --> 00:53:55.920
[laughter]

00:53:55.920 --> 00:53:56.920
But then I do the cooking shows, which is
just beautiful and enjoy. And next week, we're

00:53:56.920 --> 00:53:57.920
doing a Feastival, which is on Clapham Common,
which is basically bringing music and all

00:53:57.920 --> 00:53:58.920
the chefs of London and demonstrations together.

00:53:58.920 --> 00:53:59.920
And just have a big old party. So, I'm very
inspired. But I would one day love--. I pressed

00:53:59.920 --> 00:54:00.920
something. What did I do wrong though? What
did I do? It's got a problem with me. But

00:54:00.920 --> 00:54:01.920
I would love to do--. I actually was talking
to him about his Sabbatical. And I think sometimes,

00:54:01.920 --> 00:54:02.920
you start off so simple and then it goes crazy,
and look--.

00:54:02.920 --> 00:54:03.920
I'm 36 years old. I started my first employee
when I was 20. And I got six thousand staff

00:54:03.920 --> 00:54:04.920
now, last time I counted. Like, you think,
"Shit. What happened?" And I'm happy. But

00:54:04.920 --> 00:54:05.920
like, simple is nice. Do you know what I mean?
And even like Google, come on. I would like

00:54:05.920 --> 00:54:06.920
to have that time out. I don't know when.
I want to go to Argentina.

00:54:06.920 --> 00:54:07.920
I wanna go to Asia. I wanna go to Timbuk-bloody-tu.
And I love people. I love people. No matter

00:54:07.920 --> 00:54:08.920
where I go in the world, I always find great
food, even if there's lots of bad food. I'll

00:54:08.920 --> 00:54:09.920
always find the good stuff. So, let's finish
this pasta. OK, the pasta is gonna go in.

00:54:09.920 --> 00:54:10.920
We're gonna cook it.

00:54:10.920 --> 00:54:11.920
There was nothing wrong with yours, apart
from it did stick together, which was probably

00:54:11.920 --> 00:54:12.920
my fault 'cause I'm probably not leading the
best charge at the moment, but I'm trying

00:54:12.920 --> 00:54:13.920
my best. I'm trying my best. So, the pasta's
gone in. It'll only take hardly any time at

00:54:13.920 --> 00:54:14.920
all to cook. And we're gonna mix it up. Our
romantic couple here, you can see, is going

00:54:14.920 --> 00:54:15.920
very, very well.

00:54:15.920 --> 00:54:16.920
[laughter]

00:54:16.920 --> 00:54:17.920
We're gonna serve it up. You can share. Here
we go. And just after, once we're done, we'll

00:54:17.920 --> 00:54:18.920
carry on doing questions and bits and pieces
like that. After we've done that, I'm gonna

00:54:18.920 --> 00:54:19.920
knock out. I'm gonna be doing mushrooms, beautiful
wild mushrooms, are the best way to cook mushrooms

00:54:19.920 --> 00:54:20.920
that can go off in any way, whether it's risotto,
in bruschetta or in quiches.

00:54:20.920 --> 00:54:21.920
It's the ultimate way I cook mushrooms And
the perfect steak. So if you wanna hang around

00:54:21.920 --> 00:54:22.920
for that, you're more than welcome. It's only
gonna last 30 minutes, so, 'cause it's live.

00:54:22.920 --> 00:54:23.920
So, I've gotta pull my finger out. So things
better work. But we'll have a little--. It

00:54:23.920 --> 00:54:24.920
stopped working again. Oh dear. See?

00:54:24.920 --> 00:54:25.920
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Do you have another question
while you're--

00:54:25.920 --> 00:54:26.920
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #6: Sure. What's
your favorite food memory? The last thing

00:54:26.920 --> 00:54:27.920
you ate that you thought, "Oh, my God, this
is absurd."

00:54:27.920 --> 00:54:28.920
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: OK. The last thing I did that
was like, uniquely like that, OK. We had this

00:54:28.920 --> 00:54:29.920
bouncing around. We were in Yorkshire, where
they invented the Yorkshire pudding. And we

00:54:29.920 --> 00:54:30.920
were making it with various people and it
was lovely. And if you look at Yorkshire pudding,

00:54:30.920 --> 00:54:31.920
it's very similar to a blini or a pancake
batter.

00:54:31.920 --> 00:54:32.920
And I'm thinking blini. And I was thinking,
"Smoked fish, smoked salmon." And then I made

00:54:32.920 --> 00:54:33.920
this very, very simple--. And it sounds ultra-humble
and it is, but it's like, smoked trout, lemon

00:54:33.920 --> 00:54:34.920
juice, cream cheese, some light herbs. And
so, smoky, sour, and creamy. And then I did

00:54:34.920 --> 00:54:35.920
these little mini Yorkshire puddings that
I just like, straight out of the oven, big

00:54:35.920 --> 00:54:36.920
and fluffy and then just used it like little--.

00:54:36.920 --> 00:54:37.920
Had the two together. Basically, a pot of
smoked fish pate and these lovely Yorkshire

00:54:37.920 --> 00:54:38.920
puddings. And I went, "Oh my God, this is
amazing." And I started--. And everyone was

00:54:38.920 --> 00:54:39.920
like, "Wow." And it's really funny. And I
had to, oh yeah. We had grated horseradish

00:54:39.920 --> 00:54:40.920
with the smoked fish. It was unbelievable.
But I thought, "Why have I never tried that

00:54:40.920 --> 00:54:41.920
before?"

00:54:41.920 --> 00:54:42.920
But it's nice when you give it to other people
and you can see in their eyes as well. It's

00:54:42.920 --> 00:54:43.920
good. But to be honest, the way things work,
it's like that all the time. We're cooking

00:54:43.920 --> 00:54:44.920
every--. I mean, I'm still cooking every single
day. And we're testing things every single

00:54:44.920 --> 00:54:45.920
day. So, with the pasta, we'll go into our
parmesan, into our sauce here. This is probably

00:54:45.920 --> 00:54:46.920
the worst pasta I've ever cooked in my life.

00:54:46.920 --> 00:54:47.920
[laughter]

00:54:47.920 --> 00:54:48.920
I do apologize. This is the beauty of cooking
not on gas.

00:54:48.920 --> 00:54:49.920
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: So, Jamie. Did you ever
have a bad day where it doesn't work out on

00:54:49.920 --> 00:54:50.920
you?

00:54:50.920 --> 00:54:51.920
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: Like today, yeah.

00:54:51.920 --> 00:54:52.920
[laughter]

00:54:52.920 --> 00:54:53.920
Yeah. Not too often, but that is really fuckin'
horrible.

00:54:53.920 --> 00:54:54.920
[laughter]

00:54:54.920 --> 00:54:55.920
God bless. You're gonna get the idea, but
use your imagination, all right?

00:54:55.920 --> 00:54:56.920
[laughter]

00:54:56.920 --> 00:54:57.920
My God. I'm with an Italian as well.

00:54:57.920 --> 00:54:58.920
&gt;&gt;Maria: Doesn't look good.

00:54:58.920 --> 00:54:59.920
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: Here we go.

00:54:59.920 --> 00:55:00.920
[laughter]

00:55:00.920 --> 00:55:01.920
This is not good.

00:55:01.920 --> 00:55:02.920
&gt;&gt;Maria: Is that pasta?

00:55:02.920 --> 00:55:03.920
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: No. It's fuckin' horrible.
OK. Let's just pretend that never happened.

00:55:03.920 --> 00:55:04.920
Bless you. Tuck in. Try not to vomit. The
sauce is very fresh.

00:55:04.920 --> 00:55:05.920
[applause]

00:55:05.920 --> 00:55:06.920
I promise the next bit will work. If I can
get that pan to work. Yes, but I think the

00:55:06.920 --> 00:55:07.920
worst thing, I've been cooking a lot in wood
ovens in the last year and a half. And when

00:55:07.920 --> 00:55:08.920
you get it wrong in a wood oven, you really
screw things up. Not just on induction hobs.

00:55:08.920 --> 00:55:09.920
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: What? Does the oven catch
light?

00:55:09.920 --> 00:55:10.920
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: You just--. When you've spent
seven hours slow-cooking like a lovely shoulder

00:55:10.920 --> 00:55:11.920
of pork or something like that, and then you
don't look at it for a second and you just

00:55:11.920 --> 00:55:12.920
nuke it, then there's nothing savable at all.
It's a nightmare.

00:55:12.920 --> 00:55:13.920
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: That's a bad day.

00:55:13.920 --> 00:55:14.920
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: Yeah.

00:55:14.920 --> 00:55:15.920
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: I think we've got another
question here. We've got about another five

00:55:15.920 --> 00:55:16.920
minutes to go, so--.

00:55:16.920 --> 00:55:17.920
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #7: If you could
have one tip, for example, you have friends

00:55:17.920 --> 00:55:18.920
that love McDonald's and all the unhealthy
stuff and everything massively with sauces

00:55:18.920 --> 00:55:19.920
and everything, how would you excite people
like that to go into the healthy route?

00:55:19.920 --> 00:55:20.920
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: To be honest, I think what
I try to do when I did 20-Minute Meals app,

00:55:20.920 --> 00:55:21.920
was like--. That was a really interesting
time for me because we had the shopping list

00:55:21.920 --> 00:55:22.920
bit and we also had the recipe where you have
the step by step pictures and the little tutorials

00:55:22.920 --> 00:55:23.920
and if there was any techniques, there was
a little video.

00:55:23.920 --> 00:55:24.920
And for me, that was the ultimate actually.
It was like an app is better than a book because

00:55:24.920 --> 00:55:25.920
it's got all the extra bits that you could
never put in a book. So, that was interesting

00:55:25.920 --> 00:55:26.920
for me because most of the people that bought
it, most of them, had never bought a book

00:55:26.920 --> 00:55:27.920
before. So, it was a new audience. But also,
it was amazing seeing people shopping with

00:55:27.920 --> 00:55:28.920
it and then Twittering about it.

00:55:28.920 --> 00:55:29.920
And so, I think phones are really great for
that. And we're on Android now. So--

00:55:29.920 --> 00:55:30.920
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Thank God for that.

00:55:30.920 --> 00:55:31.920
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: Yeah. We got there. We got
there in the end.

00:55:31.920 --> 00:55:32.920
[applause]

00:55:32.920 --> 00:55:33.920
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Will you make them with
the Android here? That's where we cook.

00:55:33.920 --> 00:55:34.920
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: Yes. Well I think just making
things simple. I mean, I love when they work,

00:55:34.920 --> 00:55:35.920
like the pan or the griddle pan or the wok,
is brilliant--really, really good. And I think

00:55:35.920 --> 00:55:36.920
you can have little four, five ingredient
dishes, like I said, using the chili and the

00:55:36.920 --> 00:55:37.920
herbs and citrus and olive oil.

00:55:37.920 --> 00:55:38.920
That's the bedrock of everything I do. Yes,
darling?

00:55:38.920 --> 00:55:39.920
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #8: Hi Jamie.

00:55:39.920 --> 00:55:40.920
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: Hi, darling.

00:55:40.920 --> 00:55:41.920
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #8: I'd like to make
a lot of your pasta dishes, but I'm gluten

00:55:41.920 --> 00:55:42.920
intolerant. Do you have any tips for making
gluten-free pasta, or would you just avoid

00:55:42.920 --> 00:55:43.920
it altogether?

00:55:43.920 --> 00:55:44.920
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: Umm, no. What you can do is
there's parts of Italy--I don't know if you've

00:55:44.920 --> 00:55:45.920
seen it before--where they make pasta out
of chestnut flour, or even polenta. It's not

00:55:45.920 --> 00:55:46.920
very common, but they do do it.

00:55:46.920 --> 00:55:47.920
And you get firmer dough. And literally, you
just go and get finely ground polenta or maize

00:55:47.920 --> 00:55:48.920
and you mix it with water. You make a tight
dough and you get one of those little pasta

00:55:48.920 --> 00:55:49.920
rollers. And you make the sheet and you can
cut it up. It's not the same as regular pasta.

00:55:49.920 --> 00:55:50.920
It's more robust. But at the end of the day,
it's still beautiful and it can carry lovely

00:55:50.920 --> 00:55:51.920
sauces and stuff like that.

00:55:51.920 --> 00:55:52.920
Actually, I'll tell you what. I think I have--.
Come up here, darling. And I'm gonna give

00:55:52.920 --> 00:55:53.920
you a present.

00:55:53.920 --> 00:55:54.920
&gt;&gt;Audience: Aww.

00:55:54.920 --> 00:55:55.920
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: We have a pasta machine here.
Which you can have.

00:55:55.920 --> 00:55:56.920
[applause]

00:55:56.920 --> 00:55:57.920
So, good luck.

00:55:57.920 --> 00:55:58.920
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Gotta ask good questions.
How about that?

00:55:58.920 --> 00:55:59.920
&gt;&gt;Maria: That was nice.

00:55:59.920 --> 00:56:00.920
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: Yeah. They're still eating,
there.

00:56:00.920 --> 00:56:01.920
&gt;&gt;Maria: Yeah.

00:56:01.920 --> 00:56:02.920
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Anybody else have questions?
I've got a question for Glenn. How's the meal,

00:56:02.920 --> 00:56:03.920
Glenn? How's it going?

00:56:03.920 --> 00:56:04.920
&gt;&gt;Glenn: Absolutely pucca .

00:56:04.920 --> 00:56:05.920
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: Oh my God.

00:56:05.920 --> 00:56:06.920
[laughter]

00:56:06.920 --> 00:56:07.920
&gt;&gt;Glenn: You want more? You want more?

00:56:07.920 --> 00:56:08.920
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: How's your romantic date going?
I don't know what that means. Bless.

00:56:08.920 --> 00:56:09.920
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: All right. We got another
question.

00:56:09.920 --> 00:56:10.920
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #9: Hi, Jamie.

00:56:10.920 --> 00:56:11.920
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: Hi, darling.

00:56:11.920 --> 00:56:12.920
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #9: Apart from your
own restaurants, what's your favorite place

00:56:12.920 --> 00:56:13.920
to eat out in London?

00:56:13.920 --> 00:56:14.920
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: Well obviously, I worked for
many, many years in The River Café . I love

00:56:14.920 --> 00:56:15.920
that. Places like Moro in Exmouth Market I
love, but I used to work with those guys,

00:56:15.920 --> 00:56:16.920
too. Places like Trullo in Islington, with
that--.

00:56:16.920 --> 00:56:17.920
[clapping]

00:56:17.920 --> 00:56:18.920
Bless you. That's one of my ex-students, so
I'm biased there as well. We're all kind of

00:56:18.920 --> 00:56:19.920
from the same family. But it's nice. Like
with Trullo, like Tim that runs it. He was

00:56:19.920 --> 00:56:20.920
out in our first group of students from Fifteens.

00:56:20.920 --> 00:56:21.920
So, it's nice. It's our tenth-year anniversary
next year and it's really nice that the first-year

00:56:21.920 --> 00:56:22.920
students are like, they're smashing it now.
They're doing their thing and they're doing

00:56:22.920 --> 00:56:23.920
a great job. So, it's kind of a nice time.
Where else do I love, love, love? Bizarrely,

00:56:23.920 --> 00:56:24.920
I don't really get to go out much in London
'cause I'm always working, really. I'm a veteran

00:56:24.920 --> 00:56:25.920
of other countries when I have to go somewhere.

00:56:25.920 --> 00:56:26.920
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #9: Do you tend to
cook at home a lot?

00:56:26.920 --> 00:56:27.920
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: Always. Yeah. My missus don't
really cook at home. It's me. And people don't

00:56:27.920 --> 00:56:28.920
believe me, but it's true. She really doesn't
cook for me. She's done a few stews. And they're

00:56:28.920 --> 00:56:29.920
really not good.

00:56:29.920 --> 00:56:30.920
[laughter]

00:56:30.920 --> 00:56:31.920
But they're probably better than that pasta,
so you know. She's winning today.

00:56:31.920 --> 00:56:32.920
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #9: OK. Thank you.

00:56:32.920 --> 00:56:33.920
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: OK. Next question.

00:56:33.920 --> 00:56:34.920
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: Pleasure.

00:56:34.920 --> 00:56:35.920
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #10: First, a comment.
So, I'm American and I have a confession.

00:56:35.920 --> 00:56:36.920
My favorite pancake, American pancake recipe,
is yours.

00:56:36.920 --> 00:56:37.920
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: Ahh.

00:56:37.920 --> 00:56:38.920
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #10: And so, my question
is totally unrelated. I'm just wondering what

00:56:38.920 --> 00:56:39.920
your least favorite food is.

00:56:39.920 --> 00:56:40.920
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: My least favorite. Well, I'm
not really into genitals.

00:56:40.920 --> 00:56:41.920
[laughter]

00:56:41.920 --> 00:56:42.920
I have, in your country, I have taken part
in some Rocky Mountain Oysters. Bullocks,

00:56:42.920 --> 00:56:43.920
bullocks. Yeah.

00:56:43.920 --> 00:56:44.920
[laughter]

00:56:44.920 --> 00:56:45.920
It wasn't the best moment of my life. I've
been offered lots of other genitals, which

00:56:45.920 --> 00:56:46.920
I declined. In Japan, cod semen wasn't my
best moment. And I did swallow.

00:56:46.920 --> 00:56:47.920
[laughter]

00:56:47.920 --> 00:56:48.920
What was really--. What was really--. I mean,
I love Japan. I worked there for three years

00:56:48.920 --> 00:56:49.920
and I enjoy the food so much. But I'd had
no meat for a long time. And there's this

00:56:49.920 --> 00:56:50.920
little dude on this little grill and, "Oh,
God. He's got chicken. He's got chicken. Yeah!

00:56:50.920 --> 00:56:51.920
Shambone!"

00:56:51.920 --> 00:56:52.920
And he's doing a little thing. And I haven't
had any meat for like two weeks. And he just

00:56:52.920 --> 00:56:53.920
gave, and you know how they do. They give
you this beautiful perfect little thing and

00:56:53.920 --> 00:56:54.920
they give it to you. And I just banged it
in my mouth and it just exploded and I went,

00:56:54.920 --> 00:56:55.920
"Oh, it's not chicken. What is it?" [imitates
food seller's foreign language]

00:56:55.920 --> 00:56:56.920
It's cod semen. I'm like, "Ahh."

00:56:56.920 --> 00:56:57.920
[laughter]

00:56:57.920 --> 00:56:58.920
Didn't even have a choice. It was gone by
then. Do you wish you'd never asked that question?

00:56:58.920 --> 00:56:59.920
Yeah.

00:56:59.920 --> 00:57:00.920
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter:Just puts a downer on the
whole thing. So, how many people are feeling

00:57:00.920 --> 00:57:01.920
inspired by Jamie's presence here today? Yay.

00:57:01.920 --> 00:57:02.920
[applause]

00:57:02.920 --> 00:57:03.920
There's an opportunity, as usual, to get involved
in this wellness Optimize Your Life program.

00:57:03.920 --> 00:57:04.920
So, if you wanna be a champion, don't forget
to email Ollie, who's sitting in the front

00:57:04.920 --> 00:57:05.920
here, have a wave at Google.

00:57:05.920 --> 00:57:06.920
And you can become a wellness champion. I
don't really know what that means, but it

00:57:06.920 --> 00:57:07.920
sounds inspiring. Hopefully, we can do that.
Jamie,I think we're nearly out of time; I'm

00:57:07.920 --> 00:57:08.920
sorry. Is there anything else you wanted to
say?

00:57:08.920 --> 00:57:09.920
&gt;&gt;Jamie: What I want to say is that thanks
for having me. I know it's been a bit kick-bullocks

00:57:09.920 --> 00:57:10.920
scrambled, but thank you so much. It's a real
pleasure. Anything, I mean, I think the one

00:57:10.920 --> 00:57:11.920
thing for me that I'm passionate about is
whether it's food--.

00:57:11.920 --> 00:57:12.920
Well, as far as food is concerned, it's a
massively. The only thing worth more than

00:57:12.920 --> 00:57:13.920
petrol is food. And the only thing affecting
our world around us in a big, big way is food

00:57:13.920 --> 00:57:14.920
as well. And I think you might not see it
in front of you, but all of us have the opportunity

00:57:14.920 --> 00:57:15.920
to have an opinion and stir the pot. And now
is a really, really important time, and the

00:57:15.920 --> 00:57:16.920
next 15 years.

00:57:16.920 --> 00:57:17.920
So, I don't know what I'm saying, really,
apart from like, just because you're one person,

00:57:17.920 --> 00:57:18.920
doesn't mean you can't get involved. It doesn't
mean you can't stir the petition. It doesn't

00:57:18.920 --> 00:57:19.920
mean you can't get with another Mum or another
Dad at school and find out where stuff comes

00:57:19.920 --> 00:57:20.920
from that's going in your kid every day.

00:57:20.920 --> 00:57:21.920
And just mix it up, really. So, that's it,
really. But I do want to do one thing. 'Cause

00:57:21.920 --> 00:57:22.920
I've got a present for our Italian guest,
here. A little hamper. And I've got a hamper

00:57:22.920 --> 00:57:23.920
of nice, beautiful things for you.

00:57:23.920 --> 00:57:24.920
&gt;&gt;Maria: Really? Ahhh
[applause]

00:57:24.920 --> 00:57:25.920
I've also--. This is a voucher to get some
proper food, and cooked for you to take with

00:57:25.920 --> 00:57:26.920
one of your loved ones.

00:57:26.920 --> 00:57:27.920
&gt;&gt;Maria: Thank you.

00:57:27.920 --> 00:57:28.920
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: Wherever they come from.

00:57:28.920 --> 00:57:29.920
&gt;&gt;Maria: Thanks. That's so sweet.

00:57:29.920 --> 00:57:30.920
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: Take care. Thank you very
much. Thanks for your help. Bless you. Thank

00:57:30.920 --> 00:57:31.920
you, you two. Now, I think we've got something
in. What have we got here? We got a box. I've

00:57:31.920 --> 00:57:32.920
got a pasta machine here. You're gonna have
a mug. But that doesn't mean anything. And

00:57:32.920 --> 00:57:33.920
there's a pasta machine for you, darling.
Lovely to meet you.

00:57:33.920 --> 00:57:34.920
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: And Jamie, we can't let
you go empty handed. Thank you very, very

00:57:34.920 --> 00:57:35.920
much for coming today. It's been fantastic
to have Jamie here, hasn't it?

00:57:35.920 --> 00:57:36.920
[applause]

00:57:36.920 --> 00:57:37.920
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: Thank you very much. Cheers
mate.

00:57:37.920 --> 00:57:38.920
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: We've got a little gift
for you. We've got some gifts.

00:57:38.920 --> 00:57:39.920
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: It's a water flask for specimens.

00:57:39.920 --> 00:57:40.920
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: That's for testing you're
properly hydrated.

00:57:40.920 --> 00:57:41.920
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: Is it one of those suction
things?

00:57:41.920 --> 00:57:42.920
[laughter]

00:57:42.920 --> 00:57:43.920
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: We've got some Chrome bean
bags for your two at home. Some Google bean

00:57:43.920 --> 00:57:44.920
bags.

00:57:44.920 --> 00:57:45.920
&gt;&gt;Jamie: Bless you!

00:57:45.920 --> 00:57:46.920
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: They're gonna be delivered
to your house. And we got some little Androids

00:57:46.920 --> 00:57:47.920
for your little Androids.

00:57:47.920 --> 00:57:48.920
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: Thank you. Oh, yes. Four children
I've got. My God. Ah, thank you very much.

00:57:48.920 --> 00:57:49.920
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Ladies and gentlemen, thank
you very much. Jamie Oliver!

00:57:49.920 --> 00:57:50.920
[applause]

00:57:50.920 --> 00:57:51.920
&gt;&gt;Jamie Oliver: Bless you, Thank you very
much guys.

00:57:51.920 --> 00:57:51.921
[applause]
