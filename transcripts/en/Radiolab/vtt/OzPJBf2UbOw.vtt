1
00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:05.050
This is Emily. Oh, my name's Emily Gosu and I'm an artist.

2
00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:07.170
<v 1>What is your name?</v>

3
00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:12.920
<v 0>Some of you may remember that a couple of years ago we did a story about Emily</v>

4
00:00:12.921 --> 00:00:16.250
where she had been hit by a truck, gone into a coma,

5
00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.540
and then her boyfriend at the time, Allen, uh,

6
00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:21.970
had brought her back by writing on her hand.

7
00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.070
<v 1>She's writing her name on the poem of mine.</v>

8
00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:28.890
<v 0>Of all the stories we've ever done,</v>

9
00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:32.820
I think this one has gotten the most response. And when we left that story,

10
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.440
Emily had emerged from the coma and begun to recover, but she was blind.

11
00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:42.860
Totally blind, right? Yeah. I like no light any and nothing coming in. No. Okay.

12
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:44.900
Needless to say, it was a very big adjustment.

13
00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.960
I just know I just had to develop my own ways to navigate throughout the world

14
00:00:52.491 --> 00:00:56.120
and chest myself and, and being a visual artist,

15
00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.370
she had to develop new ways to draw.

16
00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:03.490
I had crayons and if you draw the crayons hard enough,

17
00:01:03.621 --> 00:01:07.940
you can feel the wax on the paper. Um,

18
00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:09.440
yeah.

19
00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:14.180
But then one day in the summer of 2012 she gets a call from the lighthouse

20
00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.310
school and New York City. The lighthouse school. Yeah,

21
00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.010
it's a school for the blind.

22
00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.770
Her mom had found out that they were trying out this brand new technology.

23
00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.430
I think they were doing this study for the FDA, very experimental.

24
00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.640
And her mom signed her up. Long Story Short, uh,

25
00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.950
Emily shows up to the lighthouse school one day and walks into this room and a

26
00:01:31.951 --> 00:01:36.390
guy named Ed gives her this thing. He gives me the device. Can you describe it?

27
00:01:36.391 --> 00:01:39.240
I mean, is it a big helmet or no, it's not.

28
00:01:39.241 --> 00:01:43.700
It's just like a regular pair of sunglasses though.

29
00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.800
They were a little heavier than your normal sunglasses. She says,

30
00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.030
cause right on the front,

31
00:01:48.031 --> 00:01:52.400
like on the bridge of the nose was a little camera playing forward and then a

32
00:01:52.401 --> 00:01:57.401
task to the sunglasses was a little wire that ran out of the camera and down to

33
00:01:58.041 --> 00:02:00.030
this little square piece of metal thing.

34
00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.200
It's made out of titanium and it's just like the size of a postage stamp or a

35
00:02:05.691 --> 00:02:07.340
little bit thicker though.

36
00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.150
Ed explained to her that the little piece of titanium was filled with thousands

37
00:02:11.151 --> 00:02:14.780
of electrodes and what was going to happen is that the camera was going to

38
00:02:14.781 --> 00:02:18.560
convert images into patterns of electricity on that little square.

39
00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.740
So he told her to take a little square, place it on your tongue,

40
00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.130
put it right on the center of your tongue and close your mouth.

41
00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.060
So I put it on and they [inaudible]

42
00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.910
<v 2>turn it on. Um, and it was like,</v>

43
00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.420
it started to tick off.

44
00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:40.330
Imagine a lot of Coca Cola,

45
00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.340
like a lot of bubbles on your tongue and always like quickly,

46
00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.220
perfectly feelings.

47
00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.810
<v 0>The idea behind this thing, according to the science writer, Sam Kean,</v>

48
00:02:50.811 --> 00:02:54.950
author of the tale of the duly neurosurgeons is that we actually see with our

49
00:02:54.951 --> 00:02:56.330
brain, not our eyes.

50
00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.410
I mean it might seem like our eyes are doing the seeing and our ears doing the

51
00:02:59.411 --> 00:03:02.140
hearing and our fingers and tongue note of the tasting, the touching.

52
00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:04.120
But that's actually not how it works.

53
00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.860
Each of our senses sends signals into the brain as electricity,

54
00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:10.750
little blips on nerves.

55
00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.650
And it is the brain that then converts those little blips into what you perceive

56
00:03:14.651 --> 00:03:18.670
as a sight or a sound or a smell. No, obviously someone who is blind,

57
00:03:18.671 --> 00:03:20.950
their retina is not sending those signals anymore.

58
00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.960
But what if there is another way to get signals for light and dark and color

59
00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:26.880
into our brain?

60
00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:27.840
<v 3>In all of our brains,</v>

61
00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:32.340
there are lots and lots of pathways going from every part of the brain to every

62
00:03:32.341 --> 00:03:33.540
other part of the brain.

63
00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:38.310
And normally your brain isn't using those pathways even though they exist.

64
00:03:38.311 --> 00:03:42.120
It's like there's a road there, but it's shut down and traffic can be on it.

65
00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:43.523
But

66
00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:45.540
<v 0>what if you could open up some of those routes?</v>

67
00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.120
<v 2>Let me, uh, sit with it on for an hour or two hours.</v>

68
00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.330
<v 0>Emily says, at first she had no idea what was happening.</v>

69
00:03:53.331 --> 00:03:56.950
She would just swivel her head around and feel the patterns on her tongue chain.

70
00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:02.070
<v 2>And every time I looked around, he'd say, oh, that's his chair.</v>

71
00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.330
That's the door best me. [inaudible]

72
00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:08.470
<v 0>that's your mom. And it went on like this for awhile.</v>

73
00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:13.050
Ed showed her a ball and a square plastic banana and nothing was really

74
00:04:13.051 --> 00:04:15.540
happening for her except for the prickly feelings on her tongue.

75
00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:17.720
<v 2>But then there was this moment,</v>

76
00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:22.750
ed had this really long styrofoam broad and he last day in front of me,

77
00:04:24.141 --> 00:04:28.580
you moved it up and down in front of my face and I was like,

78
00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:33.310
oh my God, what's that? Suddenly she says, she just saw it.

79
00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:38.050
I was like, oh my God. It's just happen on his own.

80
00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:43.120
What did it look like in some of my mind is I looked like a long white,

81
00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:48.240
skinny stick. Could you see the texture of the sticker? Um,

82
00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:51.190
no. I couldn't see texture.

83
00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:55.480
I couldn't see in three dimensions. It was very flat.

84
00:04:55.510 --> 00:05:00.370
It was kind of like that kid's toy light, right?

85
00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:01.220
Yeah.

86
00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:06.220
So imagine like a black screen and little tiny white dots

87
00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:07.650
<v 0>all arranged in a line.</v>

88
00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.340
<v 1>Hello.</v>

89
00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:13.090
<v 0>So Emily was allowed to keep the brain port device for about a year and a half.</v>

90
00:05:13.091 --> 00:05:16.870
And during that time the light bright resolution of it did get better.

91
00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:19.360
As your brain learned to speak tongue.

92
00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:24.540
It was awesome when I saw the people moving in and one of the things that really

93
00:05:24.601 --> 00:05:28.920
struck me in our conversation was I asked her about this video that her mom had

94
00:05:28.921 --> 00:05:32.220
sent me, showing her wearing the device in walking down the street.

95
00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:34.700
She told me that usually,

96
00:05:34.701 --> 00:05:37.730
you know now that she's blind when she's walking down the streets of New York

97
00:05:37.731 --> 00:05:38.160
City,

98
00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:41.520
<v 2>especially uptown where the streets are a lot wider.</v>

99
00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:46.070
<v 0>She says people see her in her white cane and walk a really wide circle around</v>

100
00:05:46.071 --> 00:05:46.390
her.

101
00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:49.510
<v 2>So I uh, yeah,</v>

102
00:05:49.511 --> 00:05:52.900
I hardly ever notice other people walk here on me.

103
00:05:52.901 --> 00:05:56.750
It feels like I'm just walking alone.

104
00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:01.580
I can always hear the chatbot and the sound of topic,

105
00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:03.760
but not other people.

106
00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:06.930
<v 0>When she says when she put the device on and put that little sensor on her</v>

107
00:06:06.931 --> 00:06:07.764
tongue,

108
00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:13.750
<v 2>the sidewalk came alive. I thought it was amazing.</v>

109
00:06:13.751 --> 00:06:14.440
Like,

110
00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:19.440
I didn't know this many people were on the street at the same time as me,

111
00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:23.020
and now they're all, they're all there again,

112
00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:25.090
which you described them in a way that sounded

113
00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:28.190
<v 0>almost like a painting,</v>

114
00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:33.330
<v 2>like really soft lashes.</v>

115
00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:35.670
Everything was really soft,

116
00:06:35.671 --> 00:06:40.380
like soft flashes of ink that could move.

117
00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:42.390
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

118
00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:45.990
<v 2>There's walking and I could see their legs moving and I could see them,</v>

119
00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:49.160
their gait, but I couldn't see them clearly.

120
00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:53.590
Like I couldn't see their features or what are they wearing?

121
00:06:53.591 --> 00:06:57.820
A shirt or shorts or a dress or pants.

122
00:06:57.821 --> 00:07:02.821
I just like see their shadows and every now and then I see the light cast sit on

123
00:07:04.321 --> 00:07:05.940
them. Really? Yeah.

124
00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:11.390
<v 0>I've imagined somehow I'm like underwater creatures.</v>

125
00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:16.160
Squishy jellyfish like, yeah.

126
00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:19.050
<v 2>Yeah. Like lighting. Yeah.</v>

127
00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:23.733
<v 4>[inaudible] yeah. Like</v>

128
00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:32.483
[inaudible] [inaudible]

129
00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:38.900
<v 0>and that for Emily is what it's like to translate the city with your tongue.</v>

130
00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:41.680
New York City becomes this, uh,

131
00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:47.890
hazy c of walking fish that make their way along in the sunshine.
