Congress in Washington DC

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:20.330
[ Music ]

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:22.730
&gt;&gt; Seven hundred and
fifty seven million adults

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:27.240
around the world cannot read or
write, and 2/3 of them are women.

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.880
In the United States one

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.350
in six adults cannot read anything
more complex than a TV Guide.

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:40.090
At a global and national
level, the economic costs

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:43.730
of low literacy rates
are staggering,

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:45.600
and then there are the children.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.190
Sixty one million children
around the world

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.230
who are elementary school
age, aren't in school.

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.530
Here in the United States,

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.690
34% of children entering
kindergarten don't have the basic

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.510
language skills to be
ready to learn to read.

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:06.100
It's inconceivable that such large
literacy deficits exist today given

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.270
the vast resources available.

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.520
So here, at the Library of
Congress, it's our mission

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.410
to provide the American people with
a rich, diverse, enduring source

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:24.560
of knowledge and the ability
to read and write is critical

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.290
to fulfilling that mission.

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:31.620
It's why we support the thousands
of organizations around the world,

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:35.230
working to promote literacy,
advocating for change

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:41.520 position:56%
and empowering families, adults and
children to learn to read and write.

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.800
Literacy offers so many
life-enhancing benefits.

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:51.440
People who read, and do read are
healthier, happier and live longer.

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.910
They are more likely to
get preventative healthcare

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:57.130
and less likely to go
to an emergency room.

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.640
Globally, women and girls who
are educated have fewer children,

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.920
and those that they do have
are twice as likely to survive.

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.680
Everyone benefits from literacy.

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.360
For every 1% increase in
a country's literacy rate,

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.630
there is a permanent 1.5% increase
in their gross domestic product.

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.150
David M. Rubenstein's
creative vision

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.220
and generosity support the Library
of Congress Literacy Awards.

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.330
Each year, the Literacy
Awards program recognizes some

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.960 position:56%
of the most innovative and effective
organizations promoting literacy

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.140
in the United States
and around the world.

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.880
Through these awards, we
celebrate literacy organizations

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.830
and the dedicated people who,
through passion and hard work,

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.620
are bringing education and
literacy to an unprecedented number

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.450
of people around the globe.

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:48.200 position:56%
We hope to inspire others to emulate
these groups and to do their part

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.930
to help end illiteracy in their
own communities and beyond.

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.940
We still have a long
way to go, together,

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.510
we're making tremendous progress.
