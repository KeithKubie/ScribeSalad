00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.419
I have some data here it says a golf

00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:02.429
I have some data here it says a golf
 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:05.150
I have some data here it says a golf
ball is hit down a fairway the following

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.160
ball is hit down a fairway the following
 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.130
ball is hit down a fairway the following
table shows the height of the ball with

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140
table shows the height of the ball with
 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.620
table shows the height of the ball with
respect to time the ball is hit at an

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630
respect to time the ball is hit at an
 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.470
respect to time the ball is hit at an
angle of 70 degrees with the horizontal

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:11.480
angle of 70 degrees with the horizontal
 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:14.660
angle of 70 degrees with the horizontal
with a speed of 40 meters per second and

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670
with a speed of 40 meters per second and
 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.029
with a speed of 40 meters per second and
then they give us a bunch of essentially

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039
then they give us a bunch of essentially
 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.220
then they give us a bunch of essentially
data samples at time zero we're at zero

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230
data samples at time zero we're at zero
 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.000
data samples at time zero we're at zero
meters at time 0.5 seconds or at 17.2

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010
meters at time 0.5 seconds or at 17.2
 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.890
meters at time 0.5 seconds or at 17.2
meters so you give us a bunch of data

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900
meters so you give us a bunch of data
 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.080
meters so you give us a bunch of data
points and what I want to do is use

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090
points and what I want to do is use
 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.080
points and what I want to do is use
these data or use these data points to

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090
these data or use these data points to
 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.470
these data or use these data points to
essentially find a quadratic function

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480
essentially find a quadratic function
 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.720
essentially find a quadratic function
that fits it better or I guess to view

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730
that fits it better or I guess to view
 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.490
that fits it better or I guess to view
it the other way I want to model this

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500
it the other way I want to model this
 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.500
it the other way I want to model this
data I want to model this phenomenon I

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510
data I want to model this phenomenon I
 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:40.940
data I want to model this phenomenon I
want to model the golf ball being hit

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950
want to model the golf ball being hit
 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.290
want to model the golf ball being hit
down the fairway or the height of the

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300
down the fairway or the height of the
 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.330

golf ball using a quadratic equation

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340
golf ball using a quadratic equation
 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.760
golf ball using a quadratic equation
what I or quadratic function and we're

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770
what I or quadratic function and we're
 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.529
what I or quadratic function and we're
going to do it using a graphing

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539
going to do it using a graphing
 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:49.790
going to do it using a graphing
calculator and actually you know if you

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800
calculator and actually you know if you
 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:50.900
calculator and actually you know if you
if you do a little bit of physics you

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910
if you do a little bit of physics you
 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.090
if you do a little bit of physics you
can figure out what the actual equation

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100
can figure out what the actual equation
 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.189
can figure out what the actual equation
would be in a vacuum but this is actual

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199
would be in a vacuum but this is actual
 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.250
would be in a vacuum but this is actual
data taken from a golf ball hit in air

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260
data taken from a golf ball hit in air
 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.750
data taken from a golf ball hit in air
when that changes things a bunch and

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760
when that changes things a bunch and
 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.490
when that changes things a bunch and
makes the physics really complicated so

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500
makes the physics really complicated so
 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.020
makes the physics really complicated so
we'll actually look at the measurements

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030
we'll actually look at the measurements
 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.670
we'll actually look at the measurements
and then try to figure out what the

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680
and then try to figure out what the
 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.140
and then try to figure out what the
actual function is and actually the

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150
actual function is and actually the
 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.370
actual function is and actually the
calculator is going to do most of the

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380
calculator is going to do most of the
 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.170
calculator is going to do most of the
work for us I won't go into the details

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180
work for us I won't go into the details
 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.120
work for us I won't go into the details
of what the calculators algorithm is I

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130
of what the calculators algorithm is I
 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.980
of what the calculators algorithm is I
just want to show you how to do it it's

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990
just want to show you how to do it it's
 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.719
just want to show you how to do it it's
safe to say that this is going to be

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729
safe to say that this is going to be
 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.300
safe to say that this is going to be
well approximated by some type of

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310
well approximated by some type of
 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.070
well approximated by some type of
quadratic function or a parabola so

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080
quadratic function or a parabola so
 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.340
quadratic function or a parabola so
let's try to fit a function to it so we

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350
let's try to fit a function to it so we
 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.530
let's try to fit a function to it so we
want to do is we want to hit stat on our

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540
want to do is we want to hit stat on our
 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.410
want to do is we want to hit stat on our
calculator you hit stat then you hit

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420
calculator you hit stat then you hit
 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.569
calculator you hit stat then you hit
edit that's what we use to input our

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579
edit that's what we use to input our
 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.240
edit that's what we use to input our
information we can click enter twice

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250
information we can click enter twice
 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.469
information we can click enter twice
this just says these are the two

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479
this just says these are the two
 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.480
this just says these are the two
variable names for where we input our

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490
variable names for where we input our
 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.210
variable names for where we input our
data I'm just hitting Enter twice and

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220
data I'm just hitting Enter twice and
 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.609
data I'm just hitting Enter twice and
now I can start entering the data and

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619
now I can start entering the data and
 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.520
now I can start entering the data and
I'll use my keyboard to do this so let

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530
I'll use my keyboard to do this so let
 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.940
I'll use my keyboard to do this so let
me so the first data point is zero enter

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950
me so the first data point is zero enter
 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.889
me so the first data point is zero enter
the X is zero Y is zero press ENTER

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899
the X is zero Y is zero press ENTER
 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:54.020
the X is zero Y is zero press ENTER
again the next data point 0.5 and 17.2

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030
again the next data point 0.5 and 17.2
 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.389
again the next data point 0.5 and 17.2
I'm just looking at this right here 0.5

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399
I'm just looking at this right here 0.5
 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:01.450
I'm just looking at this right here 0.5
and 17 point to next data point we have

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460
and 17 point to next data point we have
 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.469
and 17 point to next data point we have
X is 1.5 when X is 1 point 5 y is 42

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479
X is 1.5 when X is 1 point 5 y is 42
 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.520
X is 1.5 when X is 1 point 5 y is 42
point nine when X is 2 y is fifty one

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530
point nine when X is 2 y is fifty one
 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.430
point nine when X is 2 y is fifty one
point six when X is two point five Y is

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440
point six when X is two point five Y is
 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.350
point six when X is two point five Y is
50

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360
50
 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:21.290
50
7.7 when X is 3 y is 60 1.2 i just keep

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300
7.7 when X is 3 y is 60 1.2 i just keep
 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.140
7.7 when X is 3 y is 60 1.2 i just keep
pressing enter' every time when while x

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150
pressing enter' every time when while x
 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.979
pressing enter' every time when while x
is 3.5 Y is 62 point three meters in the

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989
is 3.5 Y is 62 point three meters in the
 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:33.979
is 3.5 Y is 62 point three meters in the
air when X is 4 y is 61 meters in the

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989
air when X is 4 y is 61 meters in the
 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:40.640
air when X is 4 y is 61 meters in the
air and when X is 4.5 Y is 57.2 so I've

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650
air and when X is 4.5 Y is 57.2 so I've
 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.520
air and when X is 4.5 Y is 57.2 so I've
entered all of the data and then the

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530
entered all of the data and then the
 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:44.960
entered all of the data and then the
next thing I want to do I'm going to

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970
next thing I want to do I'm going to
 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.000
next thing I want to do I'm going to
plot all of it but before I plot all of

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010
plot all of it but before I plot all of
 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.500
plot all of it but before I plot all of
this data I want to make sure that I

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510
this data I want to make sure that I
 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.140
this data I want to make sure that I
have the proper range on my display so

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150
have the proper range on my display so
 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.309
have the proper range on my display so
I'm going to go to graph hit range and

00:02:54.309 --> 00:02:54.319
I'm going to go to graph hit range and
 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:57.800
I'm going to go to graph hit range and
see my x minimum I want it to be 0

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810
see my x minimum I want it to be 0
 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.259
see my x minimum I want it to be 0
that's the lowest value here and my X

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269
that's the lowest value here and my X
 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:02.840
that's the lowest value here and my X
maximum I could set it well I could set

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850
maximum I could set it well I could set
 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:04.130
maximum I could set it well I could set
it actually a little bit lower I could

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140
it actually a little bit lower I could
 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.620
it actually a little bit lower I could
make I kind of max that well I set my AK

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630
make I kind of max that well I set my AK
 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.479
make I kind of max that well I set my AK
max maximum that's fine I'll go up to 7

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489
max maximum that's fine I'll go up to 7
 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:10.520
max maximum that's fine I'll go up to 7
seconds I'll make the scale that's the

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530
seconds I'll make the scale that's the
 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.800
seconds I'll make the scale that's the
measurements on the x-axis is 1 Y

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810
measurements on the x-axis is 1 Y
 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.130
measurements on the x-axis is 1 Y
minimum is 0 y maximum 70 looks pretty

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140
minimum is 0 y maximum 70 looks pretty
 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:17.360
minimum is 0 y maximum 70 looks pretty
good it seems like it'll cover all of

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370
good it seems like it'll cover all of
 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:18.680
good it seems like it'll cover all of
these numbers and some of these get

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690
these numbers and some of these get
 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.900
these numbers and some of these get
pretty close to during the 60s so 70 is

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910
pretty close to during the 60s so 70 is
 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.090
pretty close to during the 60s so 70 is
pretty good and I'll make the Y scale 5

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100
pretty good and I'll make the Y scale 5
 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:24.380
pretty good and I'll make the Y scale 5
so I don't have to make any changes here

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390
so I don't have to make any changes here
 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:25.640
so I don't have to make any changes here
but you could make changes if your

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650
but you could make changes if your
 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.430
but you could make changes if your
calculator isn't set to this already and

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440
calculator isn't set to this already and
 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.460
calculator isn't set to this already and
so we can go back to stat and then we

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470
so we can go back to stat and then we
 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.080
so we can go back to stat and then we
can what we want to do is have the

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090
can what we want to do is have the
 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.569
can what we want to do is have the
calculator calculate a quadratic

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:35.579
calculator calculate a quadratic
 

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:37.819
calculator calculate a quadratic
function that matches these points as

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:37.829
function that matches these points as
 

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:41.599
function that matches these points as
well as possible so we'll go to calc I'm

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:41.609
well as possible so we'll go to calc I'm
 

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:43.670
well as possible so we'll go to calc I'm
assuming that means for calculate this

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680
assuming that means for calculate this
 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.590
assuming that means for calculate this
is this is saying where the where is the

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600
is this is saying where the where is the
 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.810
is this is saying where the where is the
data it's the same variables we use to

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:47.820
data it's the same variables we use to
 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:49.340
data it's the same variables we use to
input the data so I'll just click enter

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350
input the data so I'll just click enter
 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:52.310
input the data so I'll just click enter
and enter twice and now here are the

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320
and enter twice and now here are the
 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:53.960
and enter twice and now here are the
different types of regressions we can do

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970
different types of regressions we can do
 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:55.759
different types of regressions we can do
we can do a linear regression we can do

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769
we can do a linear regression we can do
 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:57.229
we can do a linear regression we can do
an exponential regression power

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239
an exponential regression power
 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:59.509
an exponential regression power
regression you click more and you'll see

00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519
regression you click more and you'll see
 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:02.360
regression you click more and you'll see
a power two regression this means a

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370
a power two regression this means a
 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:05.240
a power two regression this means a
second degree regression so here we can

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250
second degree regression so here we can
 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.640
second degree regression so here we can
literally click we just select this

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650
literally click we just select this
 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.559
literally click we just select this
option that means a quadratic or this

00:04:09.559 --> 00:04:09.569
option that means a quadratic or this
 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:10.580
option that means a quadratic or this
would be trying to be a third degree

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590
would be trying to be a third degree
 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.140
would be trying to be a third degree
regression a fourth degree Russian so

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150
regression a fourth degree Russian so
 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:13.190
regression a fourth degree Russian so
we're just going to do a quadratic

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200
we're just going to do a quadratic
 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.170
we're just going to do a quadratic
regression and it figured out the

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:17.180
regression and it figured out the
 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:20.360
regression and it figured out the
coefficients of the quadratic that best

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370
coefficients of the quadratic that best
 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.370
coefficients of the quadratic that best
matches this data so I'm going to write

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380

rounded them off a little bit so now we

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:27.240
rounded them off a little bit so now we
 

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:28.880
rounded them off a little bit so now we
can use this information or maybe I

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:28.890
can use this information or maybe I
 

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:30.260

well you know X is equal to time I could
have made T instead but I think you get

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:34.440
have made T instead but I think you get
 

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:36.140
have made T instead but I think you get
the idea and now we can use this

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:36.150
the idea and now we can use this

was probably doing at other points in
 

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:41.239
was probably doing at other points in
time so

00:06:41.239 --> 00:06:41.249
time so
 

00:06:41.249 --> 00:06:43.189
time so
for example if we wanted to know what

00:06:43.189 --> 00:06:43.199
for example if we wanted to know what
 

00:06:43.199 --> 00:06:47.059
for example if we wanted to know what
was happening at time at time five so

00:06:47.059 --> 00:06:47.069
was happening at time at time five so
 

00:06:47.069 --> 00:06:49.369
was happening at time at time five so
what happens when what's why of let's

00:06:49.369 --> 00:06:49.379
what happens when what's why of let's
 

00:06:49.379 --> 00:06:52.939
what happens when what's why of let's
say 5.2 seconds into it so what happens

00:06:52.939 --> 00:06:52.949
say 5.2 seconds into it so what happens
 

00:06:52.949 --> 00:06:54.559
say 5.2 seconds into it so what happens
a little bit further off we're

00:06:54.559 --> 00:06:54.569
a little bit further off we're
 

00:06:54.569 --> 00:06:56.839
a little bit further off we're
extrapolating we're using we're going

00:07:13.459 --> 00:07:13.469
negative five point two thirty five
 

00:07:13.469 --> 00:07:16.399
negative five point two thirty five
point nine nine and then it gave me the

00:07:16.399 --> 00:07:16.409
point nine nine and then it gave me the
 

00:07:16.409 --> 00:07:18.019
point nine nine and then it gave me the
point two nine two five so now that it

00:07:18.019 --> 00:07:18.029
point two nine two five so now that it
 

00:07:18.029 --> 00:07:19.639
point two nine two five so now that it
calculated we can actually plot all the

00:07:19.639 --> 00:07:19.649
calculated we can actually plot all the
 

00:07:19.649 --> 00:07:21.679
calculated we can actually plot all the
points and draw the regression so let me

00:07:21.679 --> 00:07:21.689
points and draw the regression so let me
 

00:07:21.689 --> 00:07:23.929
points and draw the regression so let me
so I go to I want to pick this draw

00:07:23.929 --> 00:07:23.939
so I go to I want to pick this draw
 

00:07:23.939 --> 00:07:26.779
so I go to I want to pick this draw
option up here so I can either exit and

00:07:26.779 --> 00:07:26.789
option up here so I can either exit and
 

00:07:26.789 --> 00:07:30.169
option up here so I can either exit and
then I pick draw and first I'll just

00:07:30.169 --> 00:07:30.179
then I pick draw and first I'll just
 

00:07:30.179 --> 00:07:32.539
then I pick draw and first I'll just
draw the data so that's scatter it'll

00:07:32.539 --> 00:07:32.549
draw the data so that's scatter it'll
 

00:07:32.549 --> 00:07:34.519
draw the data so that's scatter it'll
make a scatter plot of all of the data I

00:07:34.519 --> 00:07:34.529
make a scatter plot of all of the data I
 

00:07:34.529 --> 00:07:37.100
make a scatter plot of all of the data I
select it there and notice it drew the

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:37.110
select it there and notice it drew the
 

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:39.919
select it there and notice it drew the
data points as they were given that's

00:07:39.919 --> 00:07:39.929
data points as they were given that's
 

00:07:39.929 --> 00:07:41.239
data points as they were given that's
the data points right there five point

00:07:41.239 --> 00:07:41.249
the data points right there five point
 

00:07:41.249 --> 00:07:42.589
the data points right there five point
two is going to be out here someplace

00:07:42.589 --> 00:07:42.599
two is going to be out here someplace
 

00:07:42.599 --> 00:07:45.379
two is going to be out here someplace
and now I can draw the actual regression

00:07:45.379 --> 00:07:45.389
and now I can draw the actual regression
 

00:07:45.389 --> 00:07:48.079
and now I can draw the actual regression
this is draw the regression using these

00:07:48.079 --> 00:07:48.089
this is draw the regression using these
 

00:07:48.089 --> 00:07:50.499
this is draw the regression using these
coefficients right here so draw

00:07:50.499 --> 00:07:50.509
coefficients right here so draw
 

00:07:50.509 --> 00:07:53.239
coefficients right here so draw
regression and you see it actually fits

00:07:53.239 --> 00:07:53.249
regression and you see it actually fits
 

00:07:53.249 --> 00:07:57.169
regression and you see it actually fits
the data very very very very well so

00:07:57.169 --> 00:07:57.179
the data very very very very well so
 

00:07:57.179 --> 00:07:59.359
the data very very very very well so
let's use this function that seems to

00:07:59.359 --> 00:07:59.369
let's use this function that seems to
 

00:07:59.369 --> 00:08:02.299
let's use this function that seems to
fit the data very very very well to

00:08:02.299 --> 00:08:02.309
fit the data very very very well to
 

00:08:02.309 --> 00:08:04.399
fit the data very very very well to
actually come up with how high was the

00:08:04.399 --> 00:08:04.409
actually come up with how high was the
 

00:08:04.409 --> 00:08:07.549
actually come up with how high was the
ball at five point two seconds so let's

00:08:07.549 --> 00:08:07.559
ball at five point two seconds so let's
 

00:08:07.559 --> 00:08:10.519
ball at five point two seconds so let's
exit from here and let's just calculate

00:08:10.519 --> 00:08:10.529
exit from here and let's just calculate
 

00:08:10.529 --> 00:08:14.899
exit from here and let's just calculate
it it is negative its negative five

00:08:14.899 --> 00:08:14.909
it it is negative its negative five
 

00:08:14.909 --> 00:08:22.629
it it is negative its negative five
point two times five point two squared

00:08:22.629 --> 00:08:22.639
point two times five point two squared
 

00:08:22.639 --> 00:08:25.279
point two times five point two squared
it's just by coincidence I picked a time

00:08:25.279 --> 00:08:25.289
it's just by coincidence I picked a time
 

00:08:25.289 --> 00:08:27.019
it's just by coincidence I picked a time
that equals that first coefficient

00:08:27.019 --> 00:08:27.029
that equals that first coefficient
 

00:08:27.029 --> 00:08:28.399
that equals that first coefficient
that's what's the positive version of it

00:08:28.399 --> 00:08:28.409
that's what's the positive version of it
 

00:08:28.409 --> 00:08:32.389
that's what's the positive version of it
so five point 2 squared plus thirty five

00:08:32.389 --> 00:08:32.399
so five point 2 squared plus thirty five
 

00:08:32.399 --> 00:08:36.199
so five point 2 squared plus thirty five
point nine nine times five point two

00:08:36.199 --> 00:08:36.209
point nine nine times five point two
 

00:08:36.209 --> 00:08:37.339
point nine nine times five point two
remember we're dealing when time is

00:08:37.339 --> 00:08:37.349
remember we're dealing when time is
 

00:08:37.349 --> 00:08:38.929
remember we're dealing when time is
equal to five point two where where X is

00:08:38.929 --> 00:08:38.939
equal to five point two where where X is
 

00:08:38.939 --> 00:08:42.529
equal to five point two where where X is
equal to five point two plus point two

00:08:42.529 --> 00:08:42.539
equal to five point two plus point two
 

00:08:42.539 --> 00:08:44.720
equal to five point two plus point two
nine so we're just going to evaluate

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:44.730
nine so we're just going to evaluate
 

00:08:44.730 --> 00:08:47.449
nine so we're just going to evaluate
this function at time or at X is equal

00:08:47.449 --> 00:08:47.459
this function at time or at X is equal
 

00:08:47.459 --> 00:08:53.059
this function at time or at X is equal
to five point two and we get forty six

00:08:53.059 --> 00:08:53.069
to five point two and we get forty six
 

00:08:53.069 --> 00:08:54.930
to five point two and we get forty six
point eight three

00:08:54.930 --> 00:08:54.940
point eight three
 

00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:59.250
point eight three
so it's equal to 46.83 or I should say

00:08:59.250 --> 00:08:59.260
so it's equal to 46.83 or I should say
 

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.950
so it's equal to 46.83 or I should say
point eight three meters so I hope you

00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:01.960
point eight three meters so I hope you
 

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:03.150
point eight three meters so I hope you
enjoy that I just wanted to show you a

00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:03.160
enjoy that I just wanted to show you a
 

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:04.650
enjoy that I just wanted to show you a
quick thing of you know how a graphing

00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:04.660
quick thing of you know how a graphing
 

00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:06.270
quick thing of you know how a graphing
calculator is useful maybe in the future

00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:06.280
calculator is useful maybe in the future
 

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:08.190
calculator is useful maybe in the future
I'll make a more advanced video on the

00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:08.200
I'll make a more advanced video on the
 

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:10.950
I'll make a more advanced video on the
actual algorithm or the actual process

00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:10.960
actual algorithm or the actual process
 

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:13.860
actual algorithm or the actual process
that the calculator used to figure out

00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:13.870
that the calculator used to figure out
 

00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:17.190
that the calculator used to figure out
this best curve
