TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hello,
I'm Timothy Jordan.

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:04.656
And this week I'm coming to
you from Sydney, Australia.

00:00:04.656 --> 00:00:06.780
Here's your update about
the coolest developer news

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:09.540
from Google in the last week.

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.400
We're making it even
easier to download

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.439
early preview builds of Android
Studio with a new website.

00:00:14.439 --> 00:00:16.980
If you loved trying out all of
the newest features in Android

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.500
Studio and helping us
make it a better IDE,

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.060
it's the place for you.

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.000
The link is in the
description below.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.940
This post outlines some cool
resources for building games

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:28.380
with actions on Google.

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.170
They include a new sound effect
library and a handy guide

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.320
for bringing text adventures to
life for Google Assistant users

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.210
on Google Home.

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.910
There's a new website for Google
Open Source that ties together

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.830
all of our initiatives
with information

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:43.750
on how we use, release,
and support open source.

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:46.520
Check it out at
opensource.google.com.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.550
We recently released AudioSet,
a collection of over 2

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.370
million 10-second
YouTube excerpts

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.270
labeled with a vocabulary of
527 sound event categories,

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.630
with at least 100 examples
for each category.

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:02.880
If you're doing audio research
with machine learning,

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:03.780
this is for you.

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.630
Details and links
are on the post.

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.430
If you use Firebase
Cloud Messaging,

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.610
updates to background process
optimizations in Android O

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:12.780
might affect you.

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.620
Check out this post for
some quick details and code.

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:18.240
Google App Engine
flexible environment

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.150
is now available
in the Europe-West

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.340
It's our first new
region since going GA.

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.470
The steps to get
started are on the post.

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:28.290
Dynamic search
ads help you reach

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.870
people who are searching for
your products and services

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:32.910
without the need for
you to actively manage

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:34.230
keywords or ads.

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:36.630
We're introducing three
improvements to them--

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.720
page feeds, expanded ads,
and quality enhancements.

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.550
Details and examples
are on the post.

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:44.040
And it's that time
of year again.

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.190
But don't worry if you miss
some of the practical jokes.

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:49.530
We've included the links
to a few of our favorites

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.389
