00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.380
 . 

00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.670
 In this presentation, we will learn the division of the polynomials 

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:07.230
 At some time these are called long division 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:08.550
 But you'll see what I'm talking about 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.330
 When we solve some examples 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:14.720
 Let's assume I want to divide 2x + 4 

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.230
 On 2 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:19.680
 We do not change the value 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.790
 But change how the value is explained 

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:24.600
 If we already know how to simplify it 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.810
 We have done this in the past, we can divide rugs 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.490
 And set up on 2, thus 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:32.100
 How much is this? 

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:37.250
 This equals x + 2 - let me type it this way-- 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.490
 Equals - if this is divided into 2-- 

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:40.340
 Equals x 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.650
 Divide 4 on 2, you get 2 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:44.880
 If you divide 2 by 2, you get 1 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.380
 If this equals x + 2, this is 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:49.910
 Very direct on what I think 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.500
 The other way is that you can extract the common factor 2 from here 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.175
 These are then deleted 

00:00:54.175 --> 00:00:56.830
 But I will also show you how to solve it using the long algebraic division 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:59.100
 Which is exaggerated on this issue 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.130
 But I want to make it clear to you that he does not give us 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.640
 Something new 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.300
 It is not only a new way, but it is useful 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.180
 In more complex matters 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.610
 So you can also write this as (2x + 4) 2 2 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.070
 How much is outside the division? 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.300
 You can do this the same way you would 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.020
 In traditional long division 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.780
 You will say 2 - always start with the upper class - 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.840
 The upper grade 2 2 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.350
 The 4 will ignore 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.050
 How much output 2x 4 4? 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:28.770
 Well, 2 2 2x = x and put 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.962
 The x in the x position 

00:01:30.962 --> 00:01:34.070
 x x 2 = 2x 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.673
 It will now be presented, as in traditional long division 

00:01:36.673 --> 00:01:39.440
 You will now be presented 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:44.490
 So how much output is 2x + 4 - 2x? 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.550
 It's 4, is not it? 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:48.740
 Then how much output 4 2 2? 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.810
 Equals 2, positive 2 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.050
 Put it in the position of constants 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.240
 2 x 2 = 4 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.280
 Ask, the rest be 0 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.530
 Perhaps this seems exaggerated 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.140
 For this matter you already know how to solve it 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.410
 You solve it in several steps 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:07.240
 Now we will see this 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.970
 A generalizable process 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.140
 You can do this with multiple borders of any degree divided 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.070
 On a multi-boundary of another degree 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:17.850
 Let me explain what I'm talking about 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:29.980
 Let's assume we want to divide x + 1 by x ^ 2 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:36.260
 + 3x + 6 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:37.780
 What do we do here? 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.050
 If we look at the upper term statement here, it is 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.030
 x, and look at the upper term statement here 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:44.550
 X ^ 2 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.140
 You can ignore everything else 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.530
 This in fact simplifies the process 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.280
 You say how much x x 2 is divided by x? 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.040
 Well, x ^ 2 x x = x, right? x ^ 2. 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.900
 x = x 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.730
 Put it in the x position 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.270
 This is the x status here or 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:04.000
 Status x ^ 1 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.350
 So how much x x (x + 1)? 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:10.722
 x x x = x ^ 2 

00:03:10.722 --> 00:03:15.810
 x x 1 = x, if x ^ 2 + x 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.080
 Now we ask, as we did here 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.220
 What do we get? 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.350
 x ^ 2 + 3x + 6 - x ^ 2 - Let me be 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:27.630
 Very careful - this is equal to -x ^ 2 + x 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.030
 I want to make sure that the signal is negative 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.030
 - Apply to all this 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.810
 If x ^ 2 - x ^ 2, this is deleted 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:38.020
 3x becomes -x 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:40.020
 Let me put this reference here 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:43.410
 If this is equal to -x ^ 2 - x, let's be clear 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.250
 We ask all this 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.720
 3x - x = 2x 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.880
 Then we lower the 6, or 6 - 0 nil 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.030
 If 2x + 6 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:58.220
 Now, wait for the upper pitch, x and 2x 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:01.530
 How much outside divide by 2x on x? 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:04.290
 Equals 2 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:07.660
 2 x x = 2x 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:11.673
 2 × 1 = 2 

00:04:11.673 --> 00:04:15.090
 2 × 1 = 2 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.790
 We get 2 × (x + 1) = 2x + 2 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:21.120
 But we will put this out of this 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.900
 We will ask them 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.240
 Instead of typing 2x + 2, we can write 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.330
 -2x + 2 And then we gather them 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:29.850
 These are deleted 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:32.780
 6 - 2 = 4 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:35.620
 How much is the output of 4 x x? 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:38.320
 We can say that this equals 0, or you can say that 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:39.570
 The rest 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:45.410
 4 is the rest 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:55.680
 If we want to rewrite x ^ 2 + 3x + 6 / x 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.160
 + 1 - Note that this is equivalent to x ^ 2 + 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:02.980
 3x + 6 x x + 1, this is divided by this 

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:06.640
 We can now say that this equals x + 2 

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:13.130
 It equals x + 2 + rest divided by x 

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:19.820
 + 1 + 4 / x + 1 

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:24.530
 This and that are equal 

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:26.690
 If you want to make sure, if you want to move from 

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:33.130
 So to this, what you can do is hit this with x 

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:35.120
 + 1 / x + 1 And the two gathered together 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:40.780
 If this is equivalent to x + 2 

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:45.240
 I will multiply it by x + 

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:48.770
 1 / x + 1 

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:50.500
 This is equivalent to multiplying by 1 

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:53.440
 Then we add 4 / x + 1 to this 

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.870
 I did this until I got the same standard place 

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:58.820
 When you do this, when 

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:02.050
 You hit two bounds and then add 4 here 

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:06.690
 You must get x ^ 2 + 3x + 6 

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:08.540
 Let's solve another issue 

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:10.070
 It's fun 

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:18.020
 Let's assume that we have - we want to simplify x ^ 2 

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:26.310
 + 5x + 4 / x + 4 

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:29.930
 If again, we can perform a long algebraic division 

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:43.410
 We can divide x ^ 2 + 5x + 4 by x + 4 

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:45.610
 Again, we follow the same process 

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:49.690
 Look at the words highest in each 

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:51.120
 How much is x x 2 divided by x? 

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:53.390
 Equals x 

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:54.790
 Put it in the x position 

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:56.230
 This is the status of x 

00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:59.820
 x x x = x ^ 2 

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:03.440
 x x 4 = 4x 

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:05.060
 And then of course, we will ask 

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:05.990
 This is from here 

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:08.750
 Let's put a negative sign here 

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:10.240
 And then delete them 

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:12.540
 5x - 4x = x 

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:16.800
 4 - 0 = 4 

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:19.940
 x + 4, then you can see this output 

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:22.190
 You can say that x + 4 x x + 4 = 1 

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:25.770
 Or if you do not look at the constants 

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:27.770
 You'll say, well 

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:29.300
 How much is x divided by x? 

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:30.770
 Well, it's 1 

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:31.580
 + 1 

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:34.140
 1 x x = x 

00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:36.260
 1 x 4 = 4 

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.430
 We'll ask them from the top, so they'll be deleted 

00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:41.540
 We have no rest 

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:45.410
 If this simplifies to - this 

00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:48.000
 Equals x + 1 

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.600
 There are other ways you can follow 

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:51.980
 You can try to analyze the numerator to its factors 

00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:58.200
 x ^ 2 + 5x + 4 / x + 4 

00:07:58.200 --> 00:07:59.270
 This is equivalent to what? 

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:03.190
 We can analyze this raster to (x + 4) 

00:08:03.190 --> 00:08:05.910
 × (x + 1) 

00:08:05.910 --> 00:08:07.380
 4 × 1 = 4 

00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:12.980
 4 + 1 = 5, all divided by x + 4 

00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:15.700
 These are deleted and we have x + 1 left 

00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:18.400
 Whatever method we follow will succeed, but the long division 

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:22.630
 You will always succeed, even if you can not delete 

00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:24.920
 The factors are so, even if you have the rest 

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:26.870
 In this case, we have no rest 

00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:30.830
 This was equal to x + 1 

00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:37.159
 Let's solve another issue so make sure you are 

00:08:37.159 --> 00:08:39.690
 - Because this is very useful 

00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:41.650
 Get it in the tools 

00:08:41.650 --> 00:08:49.030
 Let's assume that I have x ^ 2 - call me 

00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:49.730
 Change it-- 

00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:53.850
 Let's assume that I have 2x ^ 2 - I can make this 

00:08:53.850 --> 00:08:54.950
 Setting up quickly - 

00:08:54.950 --> 00:09:01.280
 2x ^ 2 - 20x + 12 - - In fact, let's 

00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:03.800
 Make it interesting, so make it clear to you 

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:04.510
 Always succeed 

00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:06.830
 I want to move to a higher word than Quadrature 

00:09:06.830 --> 00:09:15.860
 So let's assume that we have 3x ^ 3 - 2x ^ 2 + 7x 

00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:24.590
 - 4, and we want to divide it by x ^ 2 + 1 

00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:25.880
 I have done this on top 

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:27.980
 But we can do a long division in order to 

00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:30.470
 We find the output or what 

00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:32.280
 Simplify this 

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:39.250
 x ^ 2 + 1 divided by all these at the top, ie 3x ^ 3 

00:09:39.250 --> 00:09:46.140
 - 2x ^ 2 + 7x - 4 

00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:48.790
 Again, look at the phrase upper score 

00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:52.010
 How much is the divide by 3x ^ 3 on x ^ 2? 

00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:55.930
 Well, it's 3x 

00:09:55.930 --> 00:09:58.830
 We multiply 3x by this, we get 3x ^ 3 

00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:00.930
 Outside the division it is 3x 

00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:03.885
 So we have to write 3x here in x position. if 

00:10:03.885 --> 00:10:09.000
 Outside the division is 3x, so 

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.380
 Now let's hit 

00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:17.130
 3x × x ^ 2 = 3x ^ 3, is not it? 

00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:20.820
 (3x × x ^ 2) + (3x × 1) 

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:24.350
 If we have here 3x 

00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:26.380
 I make sure it is positioned in x 

00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:28.440
 We will ask them 

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:30.090
 What do we get? 

00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:32.000
 What do we get when we do this? 

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.060
 These are deleted 

00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:36.090
 We have -2x ^ 2 

00:10:36.090 --> 00:10:39.890
 Then 7x - - because I've subtracted 0 from here - 

00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:45.830
 7x - 3x = positive 4x, we have -4 

00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:48.140
 Again, look at the phrase upper score 

00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:51.450
 x ^ 2 and -2x ^ 2 

00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:53.210
 -2x ^ 2 x x ^ 2 

00:10:53.210 --> 00:10:54.960
 = -2 

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:57.450
 -2, put it in the status of constants 

00:10:57.450 --> 00:11:02.430
 -2 × x ^ 2 = -2x ^ 2 

00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:06.370
 -2 × 1 = -2 

00:11:06.370 --> 00:11:09.490
 2 

00:11:09.490 --> 00:11:11.820
 Now, we'll ask that from there, so 

00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:14.100
 Let us hit them with 1, or 

00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:15.460
 This becomes positive 

00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:16.800
 These are deleted 

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:24.520
 4x - 0 = - Let me change the colors - 4x - 0 = 4x 

00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:29.470
 -4 - -2 or -4 + 2 = 

00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:31.340
 2 

00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:36.385
 Then x ^ 2, now these have a score higher than 4x, and 

00:11:36.385 --> 00:11:39.463
 The upper class here, so we consider it as the rest 

00:11:39.463 --> 00:11:45.450
 We consider it as the rest 

00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:49.430
 If this phrase we can rewrite it to be equal to 

00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:57.490
 3x - 2 - these are the 3x - 2 - + rest 

00:11:57.490 --> 00:12:03.425
 Ie 4x-2, all divided by x ^ 2 + 1 

00:12:03.425 --> 00:12:06.150
 x ^ 2 + 1 

00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:09.150
 I hope you found this presentation enjoyable
