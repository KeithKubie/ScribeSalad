ARUN NAGARAJAN:
Hello, and welcome

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:12.030
to another great episode
of Google Developers Live.

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.620
My name is Arun Nagaranjan
with the Google Apps developer

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:15.379
relations team.

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:17.170
And it's actually a
really special episode.

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:19.085
We have a great partner
here, HelloSign,

00:00:19.085 --> 00:00:21.210
and they're going to walk
us through a great add-on

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.668
that they've build
for Google Docs.

00:00:22.668 --> 00:00:25.127
Before we get started, I want
them to introduce themselves.

00:00:25.127 --> 00:00:27.001
NEAL O'MARA: I'm Neal
O'Mara, from HelloSign,

00:00:27.001 --> 00:00:28.180
one of the co-founders.

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:29.638
JOSEPH WALLA: And
I'm Joseph Walla,

00:00:29.638 --> 00:00:31.210
and I'm also one
of the co-founders.

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:32.210
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Awesome.

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.360
We have the co-founders
of great HelloSign here.

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.530
Can you tell me a little
bit about your roles

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:38.550
within the company
and what you work on?

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:39.966
NEAL O'MARA: Yeah,
so I'm the CEO.

00:00:39.966 --> 00:00:40.890
Neal's the CTO.

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.197
And Neal works on all
the technical side,

00:00:44.197 --> 00:00:45.530
and I work in the business side.

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.059
ARUN NAGARAJAN:
Awesome, awesome.

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:48.850
So for the folks that
don't know HelloSign,

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:50.880
can you tell a bit about
what HelloSign does

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.620
and what some of your
products focus on?

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:53.870
NEAL O'MARA: Yeah, definitely.

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.985
So HelloSign is the easiest
way to sign documents online.

00:00:56.985 --> 00:00:59.110
Traditionally, whenever
you had to sign a document,

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:01.580
you'd have to print, sign,
and scan the document.

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:04.050
And so what we did is we
made it so you could sign it

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:05.895
all from your computer.

00:01:05.895 --> 00:01:08.300
You could sign digitally,
or from your phone, as well.

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.140
And what was exciting
about this specific add-on

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.359
is that, also, you can sign
it directly from Google Docs.

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:16.400
I suppose we can talk
about that in a little bit.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:17.330
ARUN NAGARAJAN:
Yeah, absolutely.

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:18.180
Yeah, that's great.

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.970
So before we dig into some
of the details of the add-on,

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:21.970
let's do a quick demo.

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:23.636
Let's take a look at
what it looks like,

00:01:23.636 --> 00:01:26.185
and then we can kind of dissect
some of the internals of it.

00:01:26.185 --> 00:01:26.560
JOSEPH WALLA: All right.

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:27.730
Let's go to the demo.

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:31.770
So we kind of have two
main workflows here.

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.340
And one of them is, you
need to sign a document,

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.130
and you need to
send it to someone.

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.944
So, for example, maybe
you have an offer letter,

00:01:39.944 --> 00:01:41.110
and you need to send it out.

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.450
And it's nice to sign the offer
letter before you send it.

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.010
So in Google Docs, you can pull
up HelloSign Sign document.

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:53.110
It shows the sidebar, and in
this case who needs to sign,

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:54.420
is just me.

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.760
So once you pull that up, it
will pull any saved signatures

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.120
you have from your
HelloSign account.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:04.730
In this case, I have
Harry Truman's signature.

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:06.430
So you can just
drag and drop that

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.600
straight into the document,
sign it right there.

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.870
It's really great, really
easy functionality.

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.020
Resize it and make it a little
nicer, and there you go.

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.700
You have a signed document.

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.830
If you don't have
any saved signatures,

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.960
you can draw a new signature.

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:27.020
So that will pop up a modal,
where with a HTML5 Canvas,

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:28.400
you can add your signature.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.440
And you can save that,
and drag it back on.

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.650
And then you can
email it out as a PDF,

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.760
if you don't want to
share an editable Google

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.910
Doc with the person.

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.980
So then the other
flow really leverages

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.250
HelloSign, and our functionality
about getting other people

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:47.370
to sign.

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.160
So in this case,
maybe you have an NDA,

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:56.945
and you need your
partner to sign the NDA.

00:02:56.945 --> 00:02:59.070
So in this case, we just
need someone else to sign,

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:02.480
so we're going to
choose just others.

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.690
So in this case,
what we're doing is

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.790
we're processing the
document on our side,

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:11.970
converting it to a format that
we can display to other people.

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:16.560
And once that's ready,
we just hit Continue,

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.440
and this is going to take
you over to HelloSign.

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.160
And you can type in
who needs to sign.

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:23.970
This can be multiple people.

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.180
In this case, we'll just do
one person that needs to sign.

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:32.945
So I'll just do Neal plus John.

00:03:32.945 --> 00:03:35.680
You can also cc people as well.

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.080
So I'll accept
there, and continue.

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.820
And then your document, just
as it was in Google Docs,

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.730
is pulled up here.

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:47.390
And then you can specify
where people need to sign,

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:48.960
maybe they need
to fill in things,

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:50.910
maybe they need to date things.

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:56.010
So in this case, let's just have
this person fill in their name,

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.860
and then let's have
them add a signature.

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:02.520
So easy as that, and
you hit Continue.

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:06.280
And here you can tell
them what the document

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.850
is, give them some instructions.

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:12.660
So, please sign and return.

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:15.444
And then you're
done, easy as that.

00:04:15.444 --> 00:04:16.110
You're back In--

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:16.470
ARUN NAGARAJAN: That's great.

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:18.089
So you started your
authoring process

00:04:18.089 --> 00:04:20.620
in Google Docs, formatted
it the way you wanted it,

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.370
and then you kicked
it off into HelloSign.

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:24.495
JOSEPH WALLA: Yeah, and
the great thing about this,

00:04:24.495 --> 00:04:26.690
is if you also integrate
with our drive integration,

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:28.536
once this gets signed
on their side, that

00:04:28.536 --> 00:04:30.620
will be automatically
synced back into Drive.

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:30.840
ARUN NAGARAJAN: That's great.

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.230
So you're tying all the add-ons,
and the integrations together.

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:34.380
JOSEPH WALLA: Yeah, that's
one of the great things

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:35.330
about the Google platform.

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.870
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Awesome.

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:36.640
That's really awesome.

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:38.090
Thank you very
much for that demo.

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:40.930
So tell me a little bit about
some of the technical pieces.

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:44.400
What are some of the interesting
points about the integration?

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.970
Are there anything that
you found surprisingly

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:49.720
great to use or challenging?

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.550
JOSEPH WALLA: Yes,
so one of the things

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:54.750
that was really great
for us was being

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:58.310
able to do the drag-and-drop
of a signature.

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:00.630
Google has basically
built-in functionality

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:02.160
that you guys have
provided us with.

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.820
So that was great.

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:09.100
In terms of how we built it,
we leveraged a lot of our API.

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:12.230
We have a publicly accessible
API, so a lot of that

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:16.180
was already built,
involving around us fetching

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:18.360
the signatures that are
associated with the person's

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:22.535
account, and sending the
document out for someone else

00:05:22.535 --> 00:05:23.480
to sign.

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:24.510
ARUN NAGARAJAN: When
you launch this add-on,

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:25.910
what are some of the
interesting metrics

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:27.160
you'll be paying attention to?

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:28.620
What will be a success for you?

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:29.900
NEAL O'MARA: Yeah,
so we always look

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:31.025
at three different metrics.

00:05:31.025 --> 00:05:32.810
One is just top
of funnel growth,

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:34.570
so how many new
users are coming in.

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:36.680
The second is user activity.

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:38.250
And then the third
is monetization.

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:39.840
So how many paid
plans are signing up?

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:45.170
So we've done multiple
Google integrations, now.

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:48.480
We've integrated with
Gmail, Drive, Google Apps,

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:49.936
and this will be our fourth one.

00:05:49.936 --> 00:05:51.810
And usually when we
compare all these numbers

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:55.750
to people who just come
to the site and sign up,

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:57.420
usually it's a lot better.

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:59.650
People are generally
more engaged.

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:01.470
Usually they upgrade more.

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:03.520
So all those key metrics
that we look for,

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:06.130
are usually quite good
when we do integrations.

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:06.640
ARUN NAGARAJAN: That's great.

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:08.598
Thank you very much for
coming into the studio,

00:06:08.598 --> 00:06:10.920
and walking us through your
process, and your add-on,

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:11.620
itself.

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:13.340
And good luck with the launch.

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:14.380
NEAL O'MARA: Yeah,
thanks for having us.

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:15.088
We appreciate it.

00:06:15.088 --> 00:06:16.800
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Thank you.
