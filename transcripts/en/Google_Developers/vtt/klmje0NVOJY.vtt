BEN: Hey, this is Ben again, and
we are at the Google I/O

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:05.870
After Hours Party.

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:07.560
We've got amazing things
to see here.

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.580
Let me find my collaborator
here.

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:10.430
Hey!

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:11.490
FITZ: Hey, Ben!

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:12.005
BEN: How was that?

00:00:12.005 --> 00:00:13.340
FITZ: That was great!

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:14.870
This is a VirtuSphere.

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:16.910
It's a virtual reality
in a sphere, and

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:17.830
they've got two of them.

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:20.210
And people are going to be going
head-to-head combat here

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:21.820
at the After Hours
Party for Google.

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:22.490
BEN: Fantastic.

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:24.590
There's a bunch of other crazy
robotic things we're going to

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:25.280
show you tonight.

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:26.560
FITZ: What else do we have?

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.980
BEN: Brainwave games that read
your brain and lets you do

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:30.600
amazing things.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.475
FITZ: We've got a 38-foot
mechanical snake.

00:00:32.475 --> 00:00:36.210
BEN: And we've got a bunch of
autonomous flying helicopters

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.640
that do amazing things.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.490
FITZ: Build things, play ping
pong, it's pretty incredible.

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:42.540
So we're looking forward to
showing you guys around to see

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.270
what we can't find to share with
you that's happening here

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.740
at Google I/O After Hours.

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:47.490
BEN: Let's take a look!

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:49.950
FITZ: Let's take a look!

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.190
We're over here now with what
looks like a giant snake.

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:53.370
Can you tell us what
your name is?

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.950
CHARLIE BRINSON: Yeah, my name
is Charlie Brinson, and I'm

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:57.470
the initiator of this project.

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:01.510
The project's called Titanoboa,
and it's a massive

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.209
recreation of this ancient snake
that used to exist 60

00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:04.830
million years ago.

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.170
FITZ: And just how big
is this snake?

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.510
CHARLIE BRINSON: Right
now, this one is

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:09.780
about 40 feet long.

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.050
But it's still in the process of
growing, so we're going to

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:17.160
lengthen it to 50 feet to
represent the original kind of

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:18.750
beast that was roaming
the Earth.

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.260
BEN: Now, when you say this
project, who is this group

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:23.170
that you're in charge of here?

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.900
CHARLIE BRINSON: So I'm the
initiator of the project, and

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.760
we have a team of about
15 or 20 people.

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.600
We're all working under the
support of a foundation called

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.060
eatART, which is Energy
Awareness Through ART.

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.040
And we build huge kinetic
sculptures that have

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.350
energy-related themes to them.

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.100
BEN: What is the energy-related

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.380
theme for this sculpture?

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.160
CHARLIE BRINSON: Well, we figure
since the story goes

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.190
that Titanoboa went extinct 60
million years ago because the

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:50.270
climate cooled down, right?

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.730
So now the climate's warming
back up, so we're resurrecting

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:57.580
this beast to get discussions
going about climate change and

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.632
showcase electric vehicle
technology.

00:02:00.632 --> 00:02:02.300
FITZ: What kind of
locomotion--

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.570
does this actually move
like a snake?

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:05.220
CHARLIE BRINSON: Yeah.

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.210
So you can see down the spine
there's all these hydraulic

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:11.310
cylinders, which are muscles
of the snake.

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.150
And they contract in such a
way that it enables it to

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:15.250
propel itself.

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.970
So it's all controlled by a
series of microcontroller

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.910
brains all down the spine
and controlled

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.635
wirelessly from the driver.

00:02:22.635 --> 00:02:24.680
FITZ: And how fast does it go?

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.475
Should we be concerned?

00:02:26.475 --> 00:02:29.850
CHARLIE BRINSON: Yeah, sometimes
it gets a little bit

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.030
of a temper going, and it
can lash out its tail.

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.100
But you could probably outrun it
pretty easily, at least at

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.720
this stage.

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.000
We're planning on modifying it
and upgrading it so that it

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.550
can really cruise.

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.670
BEN: Are any of the attendees
here going to get a chance to

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.910
drive this thing, or
is it experts only?

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.800
CHARLIE BRINSON: There's a
pretty big learning curve.

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.620
Because it can flick its tail
out and stuff, you've got to

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.460
go through a rigorous training
program before you can

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:54.910
actually get behind the--

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:55.500
BEN: Excellent.

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.210
FITZ: So other people out there
who are interested in

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:59.090
building really awesome stuff
like this, what's

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.115
your advice for them?

00:03:01.115 --> 00:03:01.940
CHARLIE BRINSON: Just do it.

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.746
Like I had this idea, and we
had no idea whether it was

00:03:05.746 --> 00:03:06.470
going to be possible.

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:07.950
But we just kind
of persevered.

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.830
And at times it looked really
like, what are we doing?

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:14.710
But once you get to the end and
you've got your product

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:16.910
that looks really awesome,
it's just the

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:17.950
best feeling ever.

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.440
BEN: Where can people see this
if they want to see it in

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:21.840
person outside of the show?

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.650
Is it going to be in a
museum or exhibit?

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:29.020
CHARLIE BRINSON: We take it to
various exhibits around--

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:32.250
like maybe five or six different
major exhibits

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.770
throughout the year.

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:38.700
So you could look it up online
at titanoboa.ca, and then

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.700
we'll have posts where
our next show is.

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:42.750
BEN: Titanoboa.ca.

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:43.040
FITZ: Awesome.

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:44.510
BEN: If you want to learn
more about that.

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:46.660
FITZ: All right, so that's
Titanoboa, and we're going to

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.210
move on and see what else
we can find around

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:49.370
here to show you guys.

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.910
Thanks a lot.

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:50.280
Appreciate it.

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.650
BEN: Thank you.

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:50.830
CHARLIE BRINSON: No worries.

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:51.700
BEN: Love your attire,
by the way.

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.950
FITZ: Yeah, that's a nice coat
you got there, I have to say.

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:54.630
It looks very distinguished.

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:55.260
BEN: Styling.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:56.420
FITZ: Excellent.

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:58.560
All right, let's roll.

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.710
OK, we're over here with
something incredible.

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:03.460
BEN: I think we're not
in Kansas anymore.

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:04.940
FITZ: So what's your name?

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:06.310
CHRISTIAN RISTOW: Christian
Ristow.

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:08.330
FITZ: And Christian, tell us a
little bit about what we're

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:10.942
standing in front of, and
are we in danger?

00:04:10.942 --> 00:04:13.420
CHRISTIAN RISTOW: You are
not actually in danger.

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:16.029
It might be fun to think you
are, but I have other pieces

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:19.390
that would endanger you
more than this one is.

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:21.649
This piece is called
Face Forward.

00:04:21.649 --> 00:04:25.260
And it's a 12-foot tall
animatronic human face made

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.390
from aluminum and
stainless steel.

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:30.630
It's radio-controlled.

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:33.950
There are 12 points of control
on the face that correspond to

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:37.640
different elements of human
facial expression.

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:41.140
And each of those control points
is controlled from a

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:42.770
control station.

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:46.240
And they're spaced and arranged
in such a way that

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.960
one person can really only
operate one at a time.

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.785
So the idea is that it takes
12 people to bring

00:04:50.785 --> 00:04:51.970
the piece to life.

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:55.520
BEN: Can you tell us what
inspired you to build this?

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:59.730
CHRISTIAN RISTOW: Basically,
I started getting, at some

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:03.920
point, very interested in
the idea of human facial

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:09.880
expression and the musculature
associated with it because

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:10.550
it's fascinating.

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:13.800
We have this amazingly
sensitive, expressive

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.660
musculature in our face, which
is devoted to one thing and

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:17.370
one thing only, and that's

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:20.210
communication with other people.

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:23.380
And it functions in ways that
are more subtle and intricate

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:24.550
than we realize.

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:27.390
And we can even occasionally
express things to other people

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:28.570
that we don't really mean to.

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:32.320
And so it's just fascinating,
and I really wanted to build a

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:35.180
piece that captured
that somehow.

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:38.130
And then, almost as an
afterthought, I came up with

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:42.080
this idea of spreading out the
controls and making it

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:44.830
something that would require
12 people to

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:45.950
really bring to life.

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:50.590
And there's an element of an
experiment in cooperation

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:51.840
built into the piece.

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:58.750
There's a degree to which
I have always hoped that

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:03.580
spontaneous cooperation would
emerge among groups of people.

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:07.390
And certain people would perhaps
take on the role of

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:11.560
leader, like OK, everybody,
let's do anger!

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:16.580
And so I have really wanted to
watch the groups of people

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:18.700
controlling the face and wait
and see if something like that

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:19.110
would happen.

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:20.310
It has happened.

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:21.920
It has happened much less
frequently than

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:22.845
I thought it might.

00:06:22.845 --> 00:06:24.440
BEN: It's fantastic.

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:26.730
The whole idea of emergent
collaboration is something

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:30.406
that's very near and dear
to our heart, in fact.

00:06:30.406 --> 00:06:31.885
It's fascinating stuff.

00:06:31.885 --> 00:06:33.680
FITZ: So where can
we go see this?

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:35.560
Is this on permanent display
somewhere, do you travel

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:35.980
around with it?

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:37.650
CHRISTIAN RISTOW: I do travel
around with it.

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:38.920
It's not on permanent display.

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:41.880
It usually goes back home to
my ranch in northern New

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:44.900
Mexico between shows.

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:49.240
It will be, however, at an event
called Artscape which is

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:54.420
a large-scale outdoor public art
festival in Baltimore in

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:56.560
late July, July 20, 21, 22.

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:57.862
FITZ: Great.

00:06:57.862 --> 00:07:00.650
CHRISTIAN RISTOW: It will
probably be the Voodoo Fest,

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:01.810
which is a music
festival in New

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:03.900
Orleans right on Halloween.

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:06.420
And it might show up at
Maker Faire, New York.

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:07.356
I'm not sure yet.

00:07:07.356 --> 00:07:08.190
BEN: Fantastic.

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:09.130
FITZ: Well, listen, thanks
a lot for taking the

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:09.750
time to show it.

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:10.720
I just hope you a great
time tonight.

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:11.300
CHRISTIAN RISTOW: I thank you.

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:12.930
BEN: I think Googlers are going
to have a great time

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:13.495
with this tonight.

00:07:13.495 --> 00:07:14.170
CHRISTIAN RISTOW: Thank you.

00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:14.830
FITZ: Let's move on
to the next guy.

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:15.380
BEN: Thank you.

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:16.920
FITZ: All right, thanks.

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:19.170
BEN: Holy smokes, where
are we now?

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:20.825
FITZ: We are here inside
the giant cage

00:07:20.825 --> 00:07:22.070
with some flying robots.

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:23.140
Hi, so what's your name?

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:23.286
PROF.

00:07:23.286 --> 00:07:24.980
RAFFAELLO D'ANDREA: It's
Raffaello D'Andrea.

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:26.710
FITZ: And where are
you from, and what

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:27.830
exactly is going on here?

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:27.963
PROF.

00:07:27.963 --> 00:07:30.000
RAFFAELLO D'ANDREA: I'm a
professor at the Swiss Federal

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.540
Institute of Technology.

00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:33.810
And what you're seeing here
is a demonstration of

00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:35.630
multi-vehicle control.

00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:39.770
These flying vehicles are
collaborating to throw a ball

00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:41.660
up in the air and then
collaborating to

00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:42.350
move and catch it.

00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:44.105
FITZ: They're really good.

00:07:44.105 --> 00:07:44.220
PROF.

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:45.110
RAFFAELLO D'ANDREA: Yeah,
they're quite good at it.

00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:47.260
There's no way that you could
have human beings control

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:48.770
these vehicles to do this.

00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:49.880
They're fully autonomous.

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:53.970
They're not remote-controlled
by human beings.

00:07:53.970 --> 00:07:56.190
And the precision required
to do this is not

00:07:56.190 --> 00:07:57.990
achievable with people.

00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:00.470
It has to be done autonomously
with sophisticated algorithms.

00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:04.020
BEN: Are they actually tracking
the ball as it falls

00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:04.960
back down to the ground?

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:05.060
PROF.

00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:05.560
RAFFAELLO D'ANDREA: They are.

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:08.180
The vehicles themselves
are not.

00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:10.760
Because we're indoors here, we
have an indoor GPS system,

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:14.560
which is the equivalent
of GPS outside.

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:18.180
And that is what we're using
to track the vehicles.

00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:20.410
The ball is being tracked as
it flies, and then the

00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:22.500
vehicles figure out exactly
where they need to be to

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:23.296
intercept it.

00:08:23.296 --> 00:08:25.880
BEN: That is amazing,
absolutely amazing.

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:27.850
FITZ: And so how big
is your team?

00:08:27.850 --> 00:08:27.946
PROF.

00:08:27.946 --> 00:08:30.830
RAFFAELLO D'ANDREA: So we have
a rather large team here.

00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:32.159
We have about six people here.

00:08:32.159 --> 00:08:35.179
We have another 10
folks back home.

00:08:35.179 --> 00:08:36.970
We do research on autonomous
systems,

00:08:36.970 --> 00:08:38.740
not just flying vehicles.

00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:41.225
So it's a team of
about 15 people.

00:08:41.225 --> 00:08:43.539
FITZ: And now for the
real question.

00:08:43.539 --> 00:08:45.710
How many of these things
have you destroyed in

00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:46.520
learning all this?

00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:46.656
PROF.

00:08:46.656 --> 00:08:47.250
RAFFAELLO D'ANDREA: Right.

00:08:47.250 --> 00:08:50.550
So these things are actually
quite robust.

00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:53.000
A lot of times, we fly them,
they bounce on the ground, and

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:53.630
they get back up.

00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:57.285
But we've probably gone through
10, 20 vehicles.

00:08:57.285 --> 00:09:00.660
BEN: Our people who are watching
this at home, they

00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:01.860
are developers.

00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:04.300
Are they able to play with
autonomous systems like this?

00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:05.950
Are there kits they
can buy or things?

00:09:05.950 --> 00:09:05.996
PROF.

00:09:05.996 --> 00:09:06.650
RAFFAELLO D'ANDREA:
Yeah, there are.

00:09:06.650 --> 00:09:11.080
So, I mean, to do this level
of autonomy is beyond--

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:13.150
this is cutting-edge research
that we're doing.

00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:16.060
However, you can buy kits
for flying vehicles.

00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:17.990
They're rather inexpensive
now.

00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:21.260
And if you're willing to do
things with a remote control,

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:24.150
human-piloted, right now it's
very difficult to have fully

00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:27.370
autonomous systems, but give it
another two or three years.

00:09:27.370 --> 00:09:29.880
BEN: I was thinking about the
things like XB, point-to-point

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:32.020
communication of small
robot insects.

00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:34.230
I've seen things like that and
wondering if that's something

00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:35.370
people can play with
at home, if it's a

00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:37.502
similar sort of problem.

00:09:37.502 --> 00:09:37.621
PROF.

00:09:37.621 --> 00:09:39.130
RAFFAELLO D'ANDREA: The big
difference with the flying

00:09:39.130 --> 00:09:40.710
vehicles, of course, is
that they're unstable.

00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:42.070
And if something goes wrong,
they will crash.

00:09:42.070 --> 00:09:45.050
So yes, that's great advice
for any hobbyist.

00:09:45.050 --> 00:09:46.650
First, start with vehicles on
the ground, so if something

00:09:46.650 --> 00:09:48.430
goes wrong, they just
kind of stay put.

00:09:48.430 --> 00:09:50.390
Or at worst, they drive
away from you.

00:09:50.390 --> 00:09:54.030
But, I mean, five years ago,
we wouldn't even have been

00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:55.410
able to come close to what
we're doing now.

00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:58.500
So every year more capabilities
are coming around

00:09:58.500 --> 00:09:58.930
the corner.

00:09:58.930 --> 00:10:00.880
FITZ: I see you've got blocks
over here on a platform.

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:01.900
So these are the robots.

00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:03.790
We've seen awesome videos on the
web, and they're building

00:10:03.790 --> 00:10:04.390
things, is that right?

00:10:04.390 --> 00:10:04.550
PROF.

00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:05.180
RAFFAELLO D'ANDREA:
That's correct.

00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:08.450
So what you saw right now is
just one of about 10 demos

00:10:08.450 --> 00:10:10.090
that we're going to demonstrate
tonight.

00:10:10.090 --> 00:10:12.470
One of the other demos is we're
going to build a tower

00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:14.660
with our flying vehicles.

00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:17.590
And we're going to play
cooperative ping pong.

00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:19.680
We're going to balance sticks.

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:22.770
We're going to learn how
to do triple flips.

00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:24.730
We're going to do some slalom.

00:10:24.730 --> 00:10:26.270
What else are we going to do?

00:10:26.270 --> 00:10:29.035
We're going to do a
choreographed dance to music.

00:10:29.035 --> 00:10:30.260
BEN: Yeah, this is incredible.

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:30.302
PROF.

00:10:30.302 --> 00:10:30.900
RAFFAELLO D'ANDREA: There's
going to be a

00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:31.380
bunch of fun stuff.

00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:31.960
BEN: Really, really fun.

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:33.560
FITZ: This is officially
amazing.

00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:34.750
We're going to have to move on
to catch up with some other

00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:37.400
robots, but thank you for your
time and have a great night.

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:38.340
BEN: See you.

00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:40.770
Thank you very much.

00:10:40.770 --> 00:10:41.820
Hey, hello again.

00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:43.690
Here we are at another
station.

00:10:43.690 --> 00:10:44.745
And what is your name?

00:10:44.745 --> 00:10:46.170
GIL WEINBERG: My name
is Gil Weinberg.

00:10:46.170 --> 00:10:49.040
BEN: And what are you doing
here for us today?

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:53.490
GIL WEINBERG: We developed a
robotic docking station.

00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:58.360
We believe that every part of
your house should become

00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:01.200
robotic, and we'd want to try
with a docking station.

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:03.440
So we think that a docking
station that's not only

00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:06.140
playing your music but actually
enjoying the music as

00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:08.310
much as you do would be
a nice way to start.

00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:09.500
BEN: So you've designed
a docking

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:10.865
station that enjoys music?

00:11:10.865 --> 00:11:13.500
GIL WEINBERG: We tried to have
it dance and enjoy music and

00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:14.500
be your companion.

00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:16.860
So it can recommend
music to you.

00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:19.220
It can tell you what he thinks
about your taste.

00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:21.810
If he doesn't like what you
like, he can have a gesture or

00:11:21.810 --> 00:11:24.550
a sound, something that you can
interact with, learn about

00:11:24.550 --> 00:11:26.850
music, and enjoy music more
when you listen to it.

00:11:26.850 --> 00:11:30.560
BEN: Sounds like what Fitz does
with me all the time.

00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:31.490
FITZ: Can we take
a look at it?

00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:32.440
Can we get a little demo here?

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:35.320
GIL WEINBERG: So one quick demo
would be me trying to

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:36.860
clap a song.

00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:40.100
And it goes through the cloud
trying to find a song that is

00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:41.850
matching my clapping.

00:11:41.850 --> 00:11:43.070
And let's see if it works.

00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:44.140
FITZ: We've got a lot
of noise here.

00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:44.360
Let's see what it does.

00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:45.865
BEN: All right, you're going
to clap a tempo?

00:11:45.865 --> 00:11:47.115
GIL WEINBERG: Yeah.

00:11:53.510 --> 00:11:56.530
Oh, we don't have sound.

00:11:56.530 --> 00:12:00.840
This is something we've found.

00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:04.305
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:12:04.305 --> 00:12:05.195
BEN: It's boogying.

00:12:05.195 --> 00:12:05.940
GIL WEINBERG: Try it again.

00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:06.620
FITZ: Try it again?

00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:07.600
All right.

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:08.850
BEN: One more time.

00:12:14.687 --> 00:12:15.176
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:12:15.176 --> 00:12:17.817
GIL WEINBERG: Well, that was
the rhythm that I wanted at

00:12:17.817 --> 00:12:18.570
the same beat.

00:12:18.570 --> 00:12:19.120
BEN: Yeah.

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:20.004
GIL WEINBERG: It detects
the beat.

00:12:20.004 --> 00:12:24.810
It detects the tempo, and brings
you songs that fits.

00:12:24.810 --> 00:12:27.040
FITZ: So it detects the beat
and the tempo, and it finds

00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:28.425
something in the cloud,
and it starts playing?

00:12:28.425 --> 00:12:29.790
GIL WEINBERG: Right.

00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:32.835
And another thing that I wanted
to show you is we have

00:12:32.835 --> 00:12:36.185
all the robots dancing
together.

00:12:36.185 --> 00:12:38.315
FITZ: So they synchronize?

00:12:38.315 --> 00:12:39.100
GIL WEINBERG: Yeah.

00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:42.670
What's nice about it is that all
the brain of the robot is

00:12:42.670 --> 00:12:43.550
on the phone.

00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:47.120
So it has all the computation,
the networking.

00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:49.740
It has all your input,
the vision.

00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:52.740
When you move, the robot always
know where you are, so

00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:55.375
you're always in the center
of the stereo field.

00:12:55.375 --> 00:12:58.230
FITZ: So it's a peripheral,
basically, for your phone?

00:12:58.230 --> 00:12:58.925
GIL WEINBERG: Basically.

00:12:58.925 --> 00:13:02.390
BEN: And it's tracking you, you
said, as you walk around?

00:13:02.390 --> 00:13:05.440
GIL WEINBERG: Because you have a
phone here, we have a lot of

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:07.970
capabilities that make this
robot pretty cheap.

00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:09.280
This can be a $100 robot.

00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:09.740
BEN: Wow.

00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:11.190
GIL WEINBERG: And all
the brain is pretty

00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:11.690
much in your pocket.

00:13:11.690 --> 00:13:14.475
When you take the brain from the
pocket and put it in the

00:13:14.475 --> 00:13:16.610
dock, suddenly the robot
becomes smart.

00:13:16.610 --> 00:13:17.240
It can communicate.

00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:18.800
It can network with
each other.

00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:23.000
It can look at you, and you're
always in the center of the

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:23.220
stereo field.

00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:24.610
BEN: Can these coordinate
for us?

00:13:24.610 --> 00:13:25.710
GIL WEINBERG: Yeah,
these coordinate.

00:13:25.710 --> 00:13:27.040
Mason, you want to try to
make them coordinate?

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:28.080
FITZ: Yeah, let's
give it a try.

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:29.340
BEN: Yeah, one more time.

00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:29.750
Let's watch.

00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:31.060
FITZ: So how do we do that?

00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:32.120
GIL WEINBERG: They
just started.

00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:33.900
FITZ: There they go, OK.

00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:36.730
I see there's two of
them going, and

00:13:36.730 --> 00:13:37.980
there's the middle one.

00:13:42.999 --> 00:13:44.300
All right, that's pretty cool.

00:13:50.397 --> 00:13:53.530
So if I really wanted to buy one
of these, can I go buy one

00:13:53.530 --> 00:13:54.340
today at the store?

00:13:54.340 --> 00:13:55.610
GIL WEINBERG: We hope to
make them affordable.

00:13:55.610 --> 00:13:58.010
As I mentioned, this can
be a $100 robot.

00:13:58.010 --> 00:14:01.930
We want to have it ready
by January of 2013.

00:14:01.930 --> 00:14:05.570
What's nice about it is that
it can use sounds that it

00:14:05.570 --> 00:14:08.580
makes by itself or sounds
from your music library.

00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:11.090
In this case, as you hear
right now, it actually

00:14:11.090 --> 00:14:13.615
synthesizes in real time
based on the gestures.

00:14:13.615 --> 00:14:15.910
The gestures actually
generate a sound.

00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:16.830
FITZ: OK.

00:14:16.830 --> 00:14:17.443
BEN: Wonderful.

00:14:17.443 --> 00:14:18.180
And this is programmable,
I assume?

00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:19.070
GIL WEINBERG: It's
programmable.

00:14:19.070 --> 00:14:21.910
We want to have an application
for kids, for

00:14:21.910 --> 00:14:23.590
education, for gaming.

00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:25.130
There will be an API.

00:14:25.130 --> 00:14:27.655
And I think just now, they're
about to play together, so

00:14:27.655 --> 00:14:29.580
maybe we can finish with
a little song that

00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:30.420
they all play together.

00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:31.330
BEN: Let's watch the
very end here.

00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:31.520
Thank you so much.

00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:31.980
FITZ: All right, thanks.

00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:34.040
For all you engineers out there
who don't want to dance

00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:35.700
like me, you've got something
to dance for you.

00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:37.330
Let's move on and see if there's
anything else to see.

00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:37.890
Thanks a lot.

00:14:37.890 --> 00:14:38.790
GIL WEINBERG: You'll be fine.

00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:40.040
FITZ: Have a good night.
