00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:11.014
-I'm actually not going to talk
about almost anything that was

00:00:11.014 --> 00:00:12.180
in that lovely introduction.

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:14.660
But thank you very much, Judy.

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:17.250
Instead I'm going to
talk only about what

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.504
you heard at the very end,
which is this project that I

00:00:20.504 --> 00:00:21.920
and a number of
people in the room

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.770
have been working on
for a couple of years.

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:27.520
And it's called the
Prediction Project.

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.270
On HarvardX, it's
called PredictionX.

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:32.350
Those of you who
know, everything

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:34.590
on EdX and HarvardX--
almost everything--

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.670
ends with X. So sorry, but
it's called PredictionX.

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:41.900
And EdX, for those of
you who don't know,

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.750
is the online
learning platform that

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:49.390
was started by Harvard and MIT
in 2012, and now has many tens

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:51.880
of partner universities
around the world.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.460
And it provides free
learning content.

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.260
And a lot of the
content that's created

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.540
takes the form of
standard courses,

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.390
like 12-week courses with
problem sets and lectures,

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.550
and things like that.

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:08.230
What I'm going to show you today
does not take that form at all.

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:11.500
So our goal in
PredictionX is not only

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.570
to bring together people
in the Harvard community

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:15.430
to have a really
interesting conversation

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:18.630
about the whole history of
how humanity has predicted

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.930
their own future, but also to
be able to make the material

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.540
that we're creating available
as very modular pieces

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.610
so that the whole world
can use it and repurpose it

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.770
however they like, including
people here at Harvard.

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.060
But we've already had
very good feedback

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.720
to the pieces we have released.

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.030
And I'll show some
of them to you today.

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.930
But just to end the
suspense, the whole project

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:47.070
won't be out online until at
least about a year from now

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.420
in terms of being finished.

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.350
And Judy was correct to say
that I was starting a book

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.319
project here to go with it.

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:54.860
I don't know how
long that will take.

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.000
I'm sure some of you who have
written books can tell me.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.707
But anyway, so the one
last thing I should say

00:02:01.707 --> 00:02:03.290
is that HarvardX,
for those of you who

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:08.340
don't know the local lingo,
is the Harvard arm of EdX.

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.169
And we have many,
many people here

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:11.910
from HarvardX today
who can tell you

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.070
more about the dozens of
other fantastic courses that

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:17.990
are being created by HarvardX.

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:19.914
But before I tell you
more about the project,

00:02:19.914 --> 00:02:21.830
I'm just going to tell
you what I was thinking

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:23.160
when I was in Rome last week.

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.660
OK?

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.260
So I was in Rome.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.130
And they're doing some
construction near the Coliseum.

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.340
And it's rather
bizarre, as you see.

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.030
So there's like these weird,
large construction fences.

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.850
And there's cranes everywhere.

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:37.410
But then there's
still the Coliseum

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:38.368
at the end of the road.

00:02:38.368 --> 00:02:40.690
And then there's guys on
horses-- well, not on horses,

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.806
on horse and buggies--
with iPhones in their hand.

00:02:43.806 --> 00:02:44.580
OK?

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.680
And on this iPhone,
you know, I really

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.180
don't think the guy
needs directions

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:53.199
to the Coliseum from there, but
he could have a predicted path

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:54.740
and it would tell
him it would take--

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:58.150
what does that say there-- four
minutes to get to the Coliseum.

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:59.956
And we're just so
used to this, right?

00:02:59.956 --> 00:03:02.080
So in other words here you
are looking at something

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.190
from the ancient
world and thinking,

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:06.600
well, you know, I could
even do Ifa divination.

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.080
We have Jacob
Olupona here, who's

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:12.270
an expert on this tradition
of the Yoruba culture,

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:14.360
which is a kind of divination
that actually takes

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.110
15 years to someone to memorize
all the poems that are used

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:22.410
to interpret the outcome
of this shaking of a tray,

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:23.900
that I might talk about later.

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.050
But there's an iPhone
app that lets you

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:28.737
do divination on your phone.

00:03:28.737 --> 00:03:29.570
I don't know, Jacob.

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:31.564
We'll have to talk
about that later.

00:03:31.564 --> 00:03:33.480
If you want to see where
the planets are going

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:34.910
to be tonight in
three dimensions,

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:36.290
if you want to see
where anything is going

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:38.710
to be on the sky, we
understand celestial mechanics

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:42.020
so well now that we have
integrated all of that

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:43.780
into this World Wide
Telescope application

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.630
that Judy has talked about
that even runs on your iPhone.

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:50.550
This little image will come
up again later in the talk.

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:52.830
This is an app that we wrote
as part of this project

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:56.190
a long time ago called Take
a Sweater that actually--

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:57.290
and my mother is here.

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:02.260
That name is in her
honor, my Jewish mother.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:06.400
Anyway, anyway, right.

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.200
So you want the weather
forecast with uncertainty.

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:09.700
OK?

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.540
So we don't just know how
to simulate the weather,

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.180
we know how to figure out how
sure we are about the weather

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.946
forecast.

00:04:14.946 --> 00:04:16.320
And so that is a
weather forecast

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.486
that actually gives, for
the scientists in the room,

00:04:18.486 --> 00:04:21.339
error bars associated
with the weather forecast.

00:04:21.339 --> 00:04:22.710
And you can go get that.

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:24.910
That might be the most
useful thing you learn today.

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:29.500
takeasweater.com, download
it on the iPhone Apple store,

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.200
whatever, just app store.

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:32.310
OK.

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:35.880
You could also learn
to do Haruspicy,

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:39.660
which is divination by sheep
liver, that was practiced

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:42.280
by the ancient Mesopotamians
and the Etruscans

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:46.476
and many cultures over the
last many thousand years.

00:04:46.476 --> 00:04:48.350
And there's a beautiful
exhibit at the Louvre

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:50.141
where you can plan your
visit and learn how

00:04:50.141 --> 00:04:52.160
to do divination on your phone.

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:57.820
And of course, you could check
the projection of Apple's stock

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:58.740
on your iPhone, too.

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.460
Just in case you were concerned
about that while riding down

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:05.250
the street on a horse and
buggy toward the Coliseum.

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:05.750
OK.

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:08.530
So I found this kind of
a very interesting way

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:10.840
to think about why we're
making this course.

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:13.410
People have been interested
in all different questions,

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:16.190
whether they're global
questions or personal questions,

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:18.930
about what's going to happen in
the future since the beginning

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:20.340
of recorded history.

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:24.416
And some of the recordings are
quite difficult to interpret.

00:05:24.416 --> 00:05:25.790
Rowan Flad is here
and he's going

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:29.080
to be able to show you how to
do divination by Chinese oracle

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:32.220
bones after, at one
of the demonstrations.

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:35.710
And the truth is even he
who's a big expert-- right,

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:38.200
Rowan-- doesn't exactly
know how they were used.

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:40.950
So we have a lot of
artifacts that we don't even

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:42.590
know exactly how they were used.

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:43.090
OK?

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:45.480
But we know what
they were used for.

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:47.700
And so, really, another
title for this course

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:50.750
could be the Past &amp;
Present of the Future.

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:51.320
OK?

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:53.570
Now how did I come--
Judy and other people

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:56.380
have told me that a way
tt-- an important thing

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:58.770
to include in these talks is
a little bit of background

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:01.470
of how you came to be
interested in this project.

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:03.310
So let me just have
a few slides here

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:05.160
to tell you about the past.

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:05.820
OK?

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:09.009
So if we go back to 2008,
my friend Annie Valva,

00:06:09.009 --> 00:06:09.550
where is she?

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:11.390
I'm going to
embarrass you, Annie.

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:14.510
So Annie Valva was at that
point working at WGBH.

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:17.820
And she invited me-- she
now works at HarvardX

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:19.570
and is responsible for
many of the courses

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:21.140
that I was talking about before.

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:24.690
Anyway, so she invited me there
to be a scholar in residence

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:27.340
and help with projects
that they had ongoing.

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:30.600
But she asked me what I
thought the public needed

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:33.080
to know about science that
they didn't already know.

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:36.114
And I said, how important
computer simulation is--

00:06:36.114 --> 00:06:37.655
or computer modeling,
or forecasting,

00:06:37.655 --> 00:06:39.735
or whatever you want
to call it-- in the way

00:06:39.735 --> 00:06:40.610
that science is done.

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:42.170
And that is not
taught in school.

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:46.370
And a huge amount of modern
science and economics,

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:50.990
which we could consider
science, and we're not even

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:52.330
to talk about elections today.

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:52.830
OK?

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:54.350
That is not science.

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:58.410
Anyway, it relies on
computer modeling.

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:00.910
And people think, when you say
computer modeling, lay people

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:04.269
think like, do you mean making
a model with a 3-D printer

00:07:04.269 --> 00:07:04.810
or something.

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:06.200
Like they don't even
know what that is.

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:06.750
Right?

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:08.630
And so I said, all
right, well, there

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:10.370
are three very important areas.

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:11.330
One is climate change.

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:12.990
That's the one I
care about the most.

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:16.070
One is the economy and
people's personal wealth.

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:18.190
And then there's their
personal health, sort

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:19.774
of epidemiology and genomics.

00:07:19.774 --> 00:07:21.440
And, you know, why
don't we do something

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:25.180
that focuses on explaining
computer simulation.

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:27.430
And so, we thought
about that for a while,

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:29.540
and my friend Howard
Cutler who's either here

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:31.130
or going-- ah, there he is.

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:32.270
Howard, great.

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:33.230
So Howard's visiting.

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:34.260
Howard's retired now.

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:37.720
But at that time, Howard was
an executive producer at WGBH.

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:39.747
And he had this great
idea like, well,

00:07:39.747 --> 00:07:40.830
that would be interesting.

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:43.470
But it would be much more
interesting to develop

00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:46.670
this 15o-slide deck-- that
I'm not showing today,

00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:51.040
Howard-- explaining how
to connect modern computer

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:53.730
simulation to old
fashioned prediction.

00:07:53.730 --> 00:07:56.450
Because modern
computer simulation

00:07:56.450 --> 00:07:58.800
is just how we predict
our future now.

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:02.080
That iPhone app telling you what
the future of the stock market

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:05.010
is is, just instead of
going out and doing augury

00:08:05.010 --> 00:08:06.580
with birds for the Romans.

00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:07.220
OK?

00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:10.530
We're maybe a little bit
more accurate in most cases.

00:08:10.530 --> 00:08:13.562
We care more about how
accurate and how well

00:08:13.562 --> 00:08:14.770
we can check our predictions.

00:08:14.770 --> 00:08:20.310
And I'll get to that in
a minute when I explain

00:08:20.310 --> 00:08:21.500
the structure of the course.

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:26.770
And so let me just also explain
that-- you have a handout.

00:08:26.770 --> 00:08:30.180
So I'm not sure if everybody
has one of these handouts.

00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:34.142
But you, your neighbor
should have one.

00:08:34.142 --> 00:08:35.850
And we're going to
get to this chart that

00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:38.024
explains the various
parts of the course now.

00:08:38.024 --> 00:08:39.690
But you'll see that
it goes a little bit

00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:42.549
in chronological order in terms
of the first, second, and third

00:08:42.549 --> 00:08:43.370
part of the course.

00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:44.680
And I'll explain
that in a minute.

00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:46.804
But I just want to give
credit where credit is due,

00:08:46.804 --> 00:08:48.460
that I was really
originally only

00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:50.610
interested in the third
part of the course.

00:08:50.610 --> 00:08:54.180
But I was easily convinced that
the first two were just as,

00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:55.730
if not more, interesting.

00:08:55.730 --> 00:08:59.220
So what happened, the
economy collapsed in 2008,

00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:00.770
if you didn't notice.

00:09:00.770 --> 00:09:04.067
And WGBH was not really going
to add a lot of new projects.

00:09:04.067 --> 00:09:06.650
And so, for all I know, this is
still on the books over there.

00:09:06.650 --> 00:09:09.680
But anyway, we
didn't really make

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:13.110
much except we had this
idea to make an iPhone app.

00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:14.784
Is John Alper here?

00:09:14.784 --> 00:09:16.200
Anyway, there's
another person who

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:18.760
was involved at WGBH who said,
oh, there's this new iPhone

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:20.550
thing and we need a teaser app.

00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:22.390
So the teaser app
for this project

00:09:22.390 --> 00:09:25.190
was supposed to be this weather
forecast with uncertainty,

00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:27.710
which it turns out is a
tremendously interesting story

00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:30.480
about being unable
to get recorded data

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:31.464
about predictions.

00:09:31.464 --> 00:09:33.380
Somebody asked me about
that in the questions.

00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:35.629
It's a great story that I'm
not going to tell you now.

00:09:35.629 --> 00:09:37.912
But it's why it took three
years to make this app.

00:09:37.912 --> 00:09:40.120
And we wound up making it
in conjunction with my data

00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:41.630
visualization class.

00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:45.941
So then one day, Annie comes
to my data visualization class,

00:09:45.941 --> 00:09:47.940
has this idea that we
should turn the Prediction

00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:49.770
Project into a HarvardX course.

00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:51.590
Because Rob [INAUDIBLE],
who's over there,

00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:53.720
has been bothering me
for-- I don't know--

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:56.650
two years at that point to turn
my data visualization class

00:09:56.650 --> 00:09:59.070
or something else into a
HarvardX class, which I didn't

00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:01.220
want to do because I
wanted to do something even

00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:02.580
weirder than that.

00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:07.310
And so Annie tells Rob, and next
thing I know by the next day,

00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:10.640
the Harvard Corporation is
in support of this effort.

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:14.840
And now here it
is 2016 and people

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:18.310
from all of these schools,
museums, and organizations

00:10:18.310 --> 00:10:22.080
are now involved in this
campus wide effort, which

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:26.270
I have had the incredible
privilege of leading.

00:10:26.270 --> 00:10:27.840
I have not done this alone.

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:29.506
There are many people
here from HarvardX

00:10:29.506 --> 00:10:32.970
who I'll introduce later who
have made this all possible.

00:10:32.970 --> 00:10:36.230
So now let me get-- now that
you've prepared your handout--

00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:38.119
to the structure of
the actual course

00:10:38.119 --> 00:10:39.160
and what we're doing now.

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:41.160
And I'm going to call
it a course or project

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:42.190
interchangeably.

00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:43.960
Just know that I don't
really mean course

00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:45.080
in the sense of course.

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:47.410
That's kind of a
HarvardX project,

00:10:47.410 --> 00:10:49.630
is what they call a course.

00:10:49.630 --> 00:10:50.410
OK.

00:10:50.410 --> 00:10:53.750
So overall, the structure of
the course looks like this.

00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:56.630
And we're going to talk about
the pieces a little bit,

00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:57.960
one at a time.

00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:02.020
But I already have explained
that today's version

00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:06.150
of Prediction has to do with
modern computer simulation.

00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:09.960
And what I mean by that is when
they talk about a hurricane

00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:12.700
now, and you see a
map, and they show you

00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:14.750
the projected path
of the hurricane,

00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:15.997
so that's a simulation.

00:11:15.997 --> 00:11:17.580
And then they show
you the uncertainty

00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:20.300
in the path of the hurricane as
like a little cone coming out

00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:21.900
along the path of the hurricane.

00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:24.710
So that's the uncertainty
in the forecast of where

00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:26.200
the hurricane is going to go.

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:28.220
Most people are familiar
with that kind of thing

00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:29.428
when it comes to the weather.

00:11:29.428 --> 00:11:31.060
But they don't really
think about how

00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:32.640
that affects the
rest of their life,

00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:36.490
how economic forecasts
and epidemiological

00:11:36.490 --> 00:11:40.710
forecasts and the
climate forecasts

00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:43.160
really combine to
determine our future--

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:44.580
the future of the whole world.

00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:46.450
So that's why I was
so interested in this.

00:11:46.450 --> 00:11:48.252
But if we go back
in time, things

00:11:48.252 --> 00:11:49.710
were done very
differently in terms

00:11:49.710 --> 00:11:51.540
of how people
thought about this,

00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:54.600
how they collected data, how
they tested their predictions.

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:56.852
And the middle part of the
course-- so the first part

00:11:56.852 --> 00:11:59.060
of course is really about
ancient predictive systems,

00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:01.164
and I'll show you some
examples from that.

00:12:01.164 --> 00:12:02.580
And we did start
at the beginning.

00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:04.230
So I have a little
bit more about that

00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:06.350
in my talk than the later stuff.

00:12:06.350 --> 00:12:09.030
But anyway, in the middle,
we talk about the transition

00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:12.596
from just collecting information
and making ideas, many of which

00:12:12.596 --> 00:12:16.030
are supernatural, to
trying to actually make

00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:17.900
predictive theories.

00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:20.824
And getting all the way to
Newton's theory of gravity,

00:12:20.824 --> 00:12:22.990
which as far as I can tell,
although we'll come back

00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:27.270
to an example-- counterexample--
is the most systematic,

00:12:27.270 --> 00:12:30.340
mathematical, successful,
predictive theory

00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:33.250
that we as humans have today.

00:12:33.250 --> 00:12:35.190
And then in
addition, we actually

00:12:35.190 --> 00:12:38.410
have developed a number of
technological tools, only a few

00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:40.410
of which I'll talk
about, and a number

00:12:40.410 --> 00:12:44.140
of kind of pedagogical
frameworks for how

00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:46.420
to think about all this
information together.

00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:49.020
So the kind of reduced
version of this slide

00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:52.962
is that, again, the name of this
is Prediction or PredictionX.

00:12:52.962 --> 00:12:54.420
And that's the full
course and what

00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:57.270
will become this book about the
past and present of the future.

00:12:57.270 --> 00:12:58.760
It has three parts.

00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:00.960
The little boxes
that you see in here

00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:02.460
have different
outlines around them,

00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:03.480
depending on
whether they're just

00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:06.080
a topic that's covered in the
course or something that's

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:11.730
more self-contained that makes
a good sort of mini course,

00:13:11.730 --> 00:13:12.580
we call it.

00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:15.140
And then I mentioned already
the technological tools

00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:17.740
and the pedagogical views.

00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:19.930
So again, in the
ancient part, we're

00:13:19.930 --> 00:13:24.360
talking about a subset of the
many, many traditions that we

00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:25.472
could have talked about.

00:13:25.472 --> 00:13:27.180
And you'll see later,
I'll explain why we

00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:28.610
had to just be opportunistic.

00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:31.520
And we couldn't really
cover everything.

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:36.340
And then, when you get to the
time of Aristotle and Ptolemy,

00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:38.340
you get to this
transition where people

00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:40.490
start thinking about
collecting more and more data

00:13:40.490 --> 00:13:42.210
and being systematic about it.

00:13:42.210 --> 00:13:43.580
So we'll talk about that.

00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:46.020
We'll also use-- I'll mention
comets a couple of times

00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:47.880
because comets are
something that now I'm

00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:50.440
pretty sure almost everybody
here knows we can predict

00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:52.170
the path of comets very well.

00:13:52.170 --> 00:13:56.150
But comets appeared to be just
random, crazy, bright things

00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:58.010
coming in the sky
at times that people

00:13:58.010 --> 00:14:00.420
couldn't guess in the past.

00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:03.830
And they were thought of as
messengers from the heavens.

00:14:03.830 --> 00:14:06.430
So that's an interesting
example of something that's

00:14:06.430 --> 00:14:09.630
now completely predictable
and mundane-- although pretty,

00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:12.700
sometimes-- and not
the harbinger of doom

00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:14.880
that it was once thought to be.

00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:17.790
Another thing that not a lot
of people educated in the west

00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:20.640
know about is the importance
of Islamic science

00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:26.460
as this transition from the
kind of Greek Aristotelian views

00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:28.300
to what we consider
the Renaissance

00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:30.980
and what a lot of people call
the Scientific Revolution.

00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:32.870
So in the course, we
talk a lot about that.

00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:35.300
I won't talk about
that very much today.

00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:38.630
But anyway, the main focus of
this rise of theory section

00:14:38.630 --> 00:14:41.030
is this path to Newton that
I mentioned before, that I'll

00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:42.330
come back to it later.

00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:44.210
And then also the
story of the longitude

00:14:44.210 --> 00:14:46.640
and how we managed
to figure out how

00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:50.150
to navigate at sea by solving
this terrible problem of not

00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:53.480
knowing where we were in
going around the Earth.

00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:56.570
And then, as a bridge
between that kind

00:14:56.570 --> 00:15:00.580
of 1700s, 1800s period
and the modern period,

00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:02.705
we talk about the
origins of epidemiology.

00:15:02.705 --> 00:15:04.580
And this is the example
I'm going to show you

00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:06.022
in a couple of minutes.

00:15:06.022 --> 00:15:06.730
I'm just curious.

00:15:06.730 --> 00:15:10.040
Raise your hand if you know
what John Snow in cholera means.

00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:11.720
Not Game of Thrones.

00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:12.420
OK.

00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:12.660
OK.

00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:14.700
So it's about a third of
the people in the room.

00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:15.150
So good.

00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:15.410
OK.

00:15:15.410 --> 00:15:17.076
Well, we'll talk about
that in a minute.

00:15:17.076 --> 00:15:18.460
But anyway, we
use that as a lead

00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:21.407
in to modern epidemiology
and personal genomics.

00:15:21.407 --> 00:15:22.990
I don't know if
George Church is here.

00:15:22.990 --> 00:15:25.960
But we're actually going be able
to feature the Personal Genome

00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:27.930
Project in the course as well.

00:15:27.930 --> 00:15:30.060
Finance, climate change,
earthquake prediction.

00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:32.490
And then like I said
before-- I'll tell you what

00:15:32.490 --> 00:15:33.940
the divination tent is later.

00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:34.520
Ask me.

00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:35.590
OK?

00:15:35.590 --> 00:15:38.590
But anyway, like I said before,
these things combine to just

00:15:38.590 --> 00:15:41.290
make the future of our world.

00:15:41.290 --> 00:15:41.970
OK.

00:15:41.970 --> 00:15:46.220
So I promised, I think, that
I would highlight the John

00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:48.110
Snow and cholera story.

00:15:48.110 --> 00:15:51.420
And I'm going to do something
incredibly dangerous, which

00:15:51.420 --> 00:15:54.240
is a live demo.

00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:54.740
OK?

00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:57.140
So is the internet working here?

00:15:57.140 --> 00:15:58.050
Hope so.

00:15:58.050 --> 00:15:58.570
OK.

00:15:58.570 --> 00:16:01.970
So anyway, just in case
the live demo doesn't work,

00:16:01.970 --> 00:16:03.900
the way that this
is organized is

00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:07.230
there's a main course page which
has some navigational layout.

00:16:07.230 --> 00:16:09.050
And then as part of
the page, we have

00:16:09.050 --> 00:16:11.820
things like video
interviews with experts.

00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:15.150
And the two experts in
this little mini course

00:16:15.150 --> 00:16:17.390
are Don Goldmann,
who you see here,

00:16:17.390 --> 00:16:22.170
who is here at Harvard and
an expert on health care

00:16:22.170 --> 00:16:24.190
outcomes and public health.

00:16:24.190 --> 00:16:25.566
And then also with
this woman who

00:16:25.566 --> 00:16:27.773
I'm not going to show you
today, but who's fantastic.

00:16:27.773 --> 00:16:29.634
Her name is Rosalind
Stanwell Smith.

00:16:29.634 --> 00:16:31.550
And she started something
called the John Snow

00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:32.810
Society in London.

00:16:32.810 --> 00:16:36.410
And she's-- we interviewed her
at the London School of Hygiene

00:16:36.410 --> 00:16:37.990
and Tropical Medicine.

00:16:37.990 --> 00:16:43.100
So if I go here to the course--
let's hide everything else.

00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:45.890
Let's make this as big
as we possibly can.

00:16:45.890 --> 00:16:46.930
We'll resume the course.

00:16:46.930 --> 00:16:48.060
It'll ask me to sign in.

00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:51.040
I'm giving a full demo
of how you use HarvardX.

00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:52.170
OK?

00:16:52.170 --> 00:16:53.800
I'll try to zoom
this in a little bit

00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:55.091
so you can see what's going on.

00:16:55.091 --> 00:16:56.900
So you just get a
little introduction.

00:16:56.900 --> 00:17:00.170
And then if we wanted to go to
kind of the introductory video,

00:17:00.170 --> 00:17:01.500
it would look like this.

00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:02.050
OK?

00:17:02.050 --> 00:17:03.140
But I really want to
show you a little bit

00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:04.109
of the technology, too.

00:17:04.109 --> 00:17:07.630
But kind of the normal
YouTube video format

00:17:07.630 --> 00:17:09.114
would look like this.

00:17:09.114 --> 00:17:10.536
And we'll hit--

00:17:13.859 --> 00:17:19.590
-So we actually went to
London, and we traced out kind

00:17:19.590 --> 00:17:21.089
of the footsteps of John Snow.

00:17:21.089 --> 00:17:24.497
And to give you just an
overview, here's the story.

00:17:24.497 --> 00:17:26.540
-I'm not going to tell
you the story on video.

00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:28.300
I'm going to tell
you the story now.

00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:29.010
OK?

00:17:29.010 --> 00:17:32.760
So very, very
quickly what happened

00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:35.800
was people didn't know-- there
was no germ theory of disease.

00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:39.800
People did not know that cholera
was a waterborne disease.

00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:42.850
And John Snow, the
physician in question,

00:17:42.850 --> 00:17:45.250
did believe that cholera
was a waterborne disease.

00:17:45.250 --> 00:17:48.355
And he basically traced
this one epidemic,

00:17:48.355 --> 00:17:50.380
this one outbreak of
cholera in London,

00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:52.400
to a contaminated water pump.

00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:54.680
And the story is so
much more interesting

00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:58.710
than that, which is why you
should go check out the course.

00:17:58.710 --> 00:18:00.540
But today, I'm
going to just show

00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:03.430
you a little bit about the
technology of the course.

00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:06.660
So, I wanted to show you this.

00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:07.160
OK.

00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:10.792
So here's my love of data
visualization coming through.

00:18:10.792 --> 00:18:13.000
And then I'm going to show
you the annotation in just

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:13.610
a minute.

00:18:13.610 --> 00:18:15.344
But so here is-- this
is this famous map

00:18:15.344 --> 00:18:17.510
that those of you who know
about Edward Tufte's work

00:18:17.510 --> 00:18:19.550
have no doubt seen.

00:18:19.550 --> 00:18:21.880
Because Edward Tufte
loves this map.

00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:22.420
OK?

00:18:22.420 --> 00:18:25.780
But then, if you would
rather see an interactive map

00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:27.880
where you can actually
play with the data,

00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:30.000
there's a video
demonstration of that.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.580
Or one of the things that you
can do in the EdX platform

00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:38.160
is actually include technologies
that run on the web elsewhere.

00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:41.800
And so here is a bunch
of interactive maps

00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:44.900
where I can turn on
and off various layers.

00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:48.580
And so this is a different kind
of visualization showing you

00:18:48.580 --> 00:18:50.490
where the density of
deaths was highest.

00:18:50.490 --> 00:18:53.120
And by the way, the contaminated
water pump was here.

00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:55.010
And this whole thing
is a really great story

00:18:55.010 --> 00:18:57.760
that you should
really go check out.

00:18:57.760 --> 00:19:02.260
And I can do things like turn
on a map of a different study

00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:03.060
that he did before.

00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:07.120
And all of this is
discussed in the video

00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:09.420
and in the text on the website.

00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:12.080
And so basically, the
site is a combination

00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:14.880
of video interactives like that.

00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:17.482
And one very
interesting feature,

00:19:17.482 --> 00:19:19.940
that I meant to show you before
but that I'll show you now,

00:19:19.940 --> 00:19:22.920
is you see this button that says
Check Out The Annotated Video.

00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:23.420
OK.

00:19:23.420 --> 00:19:25.300
So if we go here, and
this will please Howard.

00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:26.535
I don't think Howard
has seen this.

00:19:26.535 --> 00:19:28.451
This is the kind of thing
that media companies

00:19:28.451 --> 00:19:30.670
have been trying to do
for a really long time.

00:19:30.670 --> 00:19:35.076
So if I-- instead of running
the regular video-- I do this.

00:19:35.076 --> 00:19:38.499
And I say, OK, I'd like to
see a list of annotations.

00:19:38.499 --> 00:19:40.799
And then I would like to
search for interesting things

00:19:40.799 --> 00:19:41.340
in the video.

00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:44.370
And I'd like to just jump
to that part of the video.

00:19:44.370 --> 00:19:47.160
And so that's all
searchable as text.

00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:49.860
And then the video will
reload with whatever

00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:53.430
it is that [INAUDIBLE].

00:19:53.430 --> 00:19:56.060
So the whole idea is that
you can jump back and forth

00:19:56.060 --> 00:20:00.530
between text, video,
conversations with experts,

00:20:00.530 --> 00:20:02.860
tours of the actual place.

00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:04.900
And you can have
this kind of rich,

00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:08.880
do it the way that
you like experience.

00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:10.310
But then if you
want to make sure

00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:12.830
that you're understanding it,
there are actually questions

00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:15.800
about whether or not you
got this right, including

00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:17.940
even like fun little
matching questions where you

00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:19.880
can drag the answers around.

00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:22.590
And so it's really trying to
take advantage of the fact

00:20:22.590 --> 00:20:25.430
that this is an online
platform, not a documentary.

00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:25.950
OK?

00:20:25.950 --> 00:20:27.910
So a lot of people do
want to just kind of sit

00:20:27.910 --> 00:20:29.582
there and watch video,
and that's fine.

00:20:29.582 --> 00:20:30.290
They can do that.

00:20:30.290 --> 00:20:33.510
And they can do that on
their iPhone as well.

00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:36.360
But if they really want a richer
experience, they can have it.

00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:38.470
And one thing that
pleases me the most

00:20:38.470 --> 00:20:41.350
is that actually the thing
that people have commented

00:20:41.350 --> 00:20:44.820
about frequently in the last
few weeks that this has been out

00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:47.235
is, we have a 10 minute
version of the video where

00:20:47.235 --> 00:20:48.360
you learn this whole story.

00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:50.600
But then we actually have
the 40 minute interviews

00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:52.000
with each person,
where it's just

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:53.540
like the whole
conversation we had

00:20:53.540 --> 00:20:57.120
and all the details that you
would never get on a Nova show

00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:58.260
or something like that.

00:20:58.260 --> 00:21:01.620
And people who are really
into it enjoy that very much.

00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:02.120
OK.

00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:04.800
So when we were
talking to Don Goldman,

00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:08.410
he made the point that the
way studies are done now-- oh,

00:21:08.410 --> 00:21:13.260
do you like my
PredictionX water bottle?

00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:15.910
Anyway, the way
studies are done now

00:21:15.910 --> 00:21:18.800
is very different than the way
that people collected data,

00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:22.650
certainly in ancient times
and even relatively recently.

00:21:22.650 --> 00:21:25.190
And so there's something called
the case controlled study.

00:21:25.190 --> 00:21:27.740
And he accuses John Snow
in the video of not doing

00:21:27.740 --> 00:21:29.750
a proper case controlled study.

00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:32.450
And he says, how could
the father of epidemiology

00:21:32.450 --> 00:21:35.290
have been such a bad
epidemiologist to not have

00:21:35.290 --> 00:21:36.700
the right kind of controls.

00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:39.280
Anyway, I don't have time to
tell you the entire story.

00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:43.280
But what I want to tell you is
that the whole course is tagged

00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:46.480
with these tags that have to do
with how you collect data, how

00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:48.570
you design a study,
and how do you

00:21:48.570 --> 00:21:52.240
set goals and analyze the data
in the context of the study

00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:53.480
to see what you learned.

00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:57.200
And so those annotations
that you saw before happen

00:21:57.200 --> 00:21:58.730
to the text and the video.

00:21:58.730 --> 00:22:01.320
And eventually, you'll be able
to search through the course

00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:07.000
to try to understand how
studies have changed over time.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:07.530
OK.

00:22:07.530 --> 00:22:09.380
And then another thing
that we're working on

00:22:09.380 --> 00:22:13.630
is this framework for
thinking about how

00:22:13.630 --> 00:22:15.270
predictive systems work.

00:22:15.270 --> 00:22:15.770
OK?

00:22:15.770 --> 00:22:18.550
So if you think
about-- if you try

00:22:18.550 --> 00:22:21.340
to make a flow chart almost-- it
doesn't look like a flow chart

00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:23.080
anymore because
we've beautified it--

00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:26.350
but if you're thinking about
how you would start making

00:22:26.350 --> 00:22:29.060
a predictive system,
anybody-- even

00:22:29.060 --> 00:22:31.170
in the most ancient,
not recorded times--

00:22:31.170 --> 00:22:33.600
starts by observing
some phenomena.

00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:35.280
OK?

00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:37.140
Often they see this
a lot of times.

00:22:37.140 --> 00:22:38.731
And they start to
notice patterns.

00:22:38.731 --> 00:22:40.980
And then they try to figure
out if those patterns mean

00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:41.750
anything.

00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:43.670
And they come up with
some kind of system,

00:22:43.670 --> 00:22:45.393
which they might refine later.

00:22:45.393 --> 00:22:46.160
OK?

00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:49.070
And we broke down the kind
of data that people use,

00:22:49.070 --> 00:22:52.040
the kind of observations,
into four categories.

00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:54.830
So one of them is what
we call deterministic.

00:22:54.830 --> 00:22:56.850
So things like the
motion of planets.

00:22:56.850 --> 00:22:59.422
Or once you've figured
out, where are comets

00:22:59.422 --> 00:23:00.380
going to be in the sky.

00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:01.070
That kind of thing.

00:23:01.070 --> 00:23:01.640
OK?

00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:03.840
Something where it's
very repeatable.

00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:05.570
Newton's theories might apply.

00:23:05.570 --> 00:23:06.560
It's very clear.

00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:07.239
OK?

00:23:07.239 --> 00:23:09.280
Then, kind of at the
opposite end of the spectrum

00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:10.980
there, would be the
Oracle of Delphi.

00:23:10.980 --> 00:23:11.480
OK?

00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:14.770
Something which is completely
open to human influence.

00:23:14.770 --> 00:23:15.270
OK?

00:23:15.270 --> 00:23:18.780
So not even a priest with a
very well written down system

00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:23.590
but really a priest trying
to systematically interpret

00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:26.780
something that seems very
open to interpretation.

00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:28.502
So anyway, that's what
we call nonrandom.

00:23:28.502 --> 00:23:32.800
Then there's an interesting
other random-related choice

00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:33.960
which we call randomized.

00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:37.079
So things like throwing dice,
or the Ifa divination system

00:23:37.079 --> 00:23:38.620
that I mentioned
before, where you're

00:23:38.620 --> 00:23:42.362
doing something with a physical
object to randomize an outcome.

00:23:42.362 --> 00:23:44.070
And then you have a
manual that says, OK,

00:23:44.070 --> 00:23:46.290
if you get that
outcome it means this.

00:23:46.290 --> 00:23:48.490
And then the means
this has to usually

00:23:48.490 --> 00:23:51.950
be interpreted by a priest.

00:23:51.950 --> 00:23:55.430
And then truly random phenomena,
which sometimes turn out

00:23:55.430 --> 00:23:58.800
not to be random, like the
comet example I gave you before.

00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:00.740
But the classic
example in antiquity

00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:03.660
would be augury, which is
the flight of birds, studying

00:24:03.660 --> 00:24:06.690
the flight of birds-- when they
appear, how they're flying,

00:24:06.690 --> 00:24:08.300
how they sound.

00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:10.570
And just to give you
some example, Emma Dench,

00:24:10.570 --> 00:24:12.290
she's participating
in the course,

00:24:12.290 --> 00:24:15.040
in one of the interviews
explained to us that no Roman

00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:17.720
emperor would go to war
without first having

00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:22.430
a careful augury done to make
sure that the birds said it was

00:24:22.430 --> 00:24:24.650
an auspicious-- by the way
the word auspicious comes

00:24:24.650 --> 00:24:27.210
from augery-- time to go to war.

00:24:27.210 --> 00:24:30.990
So that kind of system has
been used for a long time.

00:24:30.990 --> 00:24:33.240
Now here's the
interesting thing.

00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:36.210
I didn't know this till
I started the course.

00:24:36.210 --> 00:24:39.560
Well, today if we
make a prediction,

00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:41.570
we check if we were
right, or at least we

00:24:41.570 --> 00:24:44.380
do the best we can to
check if we were right.

00:24:44.380 --> 00:24:48.960
Aristotle, who was the greatest
scientist who ever lived up--

00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:52.694
according to Islamic
scientists, Renaissance

00:24:52.694 --> 00:24:53.610
scientists, et cetera.

00:24:53.610 --> 00:24:57.690
So for like 1,000 years
plus after he lived,

00:24:57.690 --> 00:25:02.970
he was the definitive
reference source.

00:25:02.970 --> 00:25:05.440
And he believed that you
could reason things out.

00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:07.630
And so that if a prediction,
if a predictive system,

00:25:07.630 --> 00:25:10.260
seemed right, it was right.

00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:12.210
You didn't really have to check.

00:25:12.210 --> 00:25:15.390
He did involve-- his
systems involved data,

00:25:15.390 --> 00:25:19.730
they just didn't involve going
back and adjusting very much.

00:25:19.730 --> 00:25:22.020
It was more about the
beauty of the prediction.

00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:24.550
So as I mentioned before,
the Islamic scientists

00:25:24.550 --> 00:25:26.640
looked to Aristotle
as their hero.

00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:30.210
But after a few hundred years
of translating Greek to Arabic,

00:25:30.210 --> 00:25:32.840
they decided that they
didn't necessarily

00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:34.830
agree with everything
that he said.

00:25:34.830 --> 00:25:37.420
And from my own
research, not necessarily

00:25:37.420 --> 00:25:39.640
that all historians of
science would agree with this,

00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:42.530
it seems to me that a lot
of the traditions that we've

00:25:42.530 --> 00:25:44.470
follow today in
terms of measuring

00:25:44.470 --> 00:25:46.330
the accuracy of a
prediction really

00:25:46.330 --> 00:25:52.440
came from the 800 to 1,200
AD period of this heyday

00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:54.280
of Islamic science.

00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:56.170
And so, once you make
those measurements,

00:25:56.170 --> 00:25:58.480
then you can start
improving your system.

00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:01.650
And it does, unfortunately,
lead to things like epicycles

00:26:01.650 --> 00:26:04.990
upon epicycles, and weird ideas
about how the solar system

00:26:04.990 --> 00:26:07.950
works that do work but
it's not physically

00:26:07.950 --> 00:26:09.280
how the solar system works.

00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:11.910
And we'll come back to
that in a little while.

00:26:11.910 --> 00:26:14.620
But anyway, then you wind up
with this kind of feedback loop

00:26:14.620 --> 00:26:17.460
where you can keep taking more
data, checking out your system,

00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:19.220
maybe adding something to it.

00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:19.720
OK.

00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:21.390
So again the kinds
of examples we're

00:26:21.390 --> 00:26:23.490
talking about in the
deterministic system

00:26:23.490 --> 00:26:25.810
would be like
celestial motion, Ifa

00:26:25.810 --> 00:26:29.380
which is this Yoruba tradition
I mentioned before for something

00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:33.740
that's randomized, the comets of
doom are a fun random example.

00:26:33.740 --> 00:26:36.780
And I'll show you the first
little bit of fancy video

00:26:36.780 --> 00:26:37.720
from HarvardX.

00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:41.740
I've chosen one here that I
call the Egyptian bobblehead.

00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:43.780
And I don't know if Peter
[? Emanuel ?] is here

00:26:43.780 --> 00:26:46.238
and whether he would approve
of my calling it a bobblehead.

00:26:46.238 --> 00:26:48.390
But there was an interview
where he showed me

00:26:48.390 --> 00:26:51.116
what I'm about to show you with
his hands, not with the video

00:26:51.116 --> 00:26:52.740
that you're going to
see, and explained

00:26:52.740 --> 00:26:56.450
that this Egyptian doll kind of
nods its head according to what

00:26:56.450 --> 00:26:57.937
the priests do to the doll.

00:26:57.937 --> 00:27:00.520
And that it's not clear whether
the head was segmented or not.

00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:02.350
And I said, oh,
like a bobblehead.

00:27:02.350 --> 00:27:03.360
Sort of.

00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:06.930
So anyway, here's what
is the real truth.

00:27:06.930 --> 00:27:10.370
-And this is when individuals
might approach with a petition.

00:27:10.370 --> 00:27:11.600
Yay or nay.

00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:12.540
Am I in good shape?

00:27:12.540 --> 00:27:13.890
Has someone stolen from me?

00:27:13.890 --> 00:27:15.370
What about this
cow that I bought?

00:27:15.370 --> 00:27:17.830
Have I paid on the
installment plan correctly?

00:27:17.830 --> 00:27:19.670
Or is someone throwing
an accusation at me?

00:27:19.670 --> 00:27:20.800
What should I do?

00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:22.920
All kinds of
question would come.

00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:26.320
So how would the god indicate
what the right thing to do was?

00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:28.240
The hieroglyphs
talk about nodding

00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:29.879
in approval or disapproval.

00:27:29.879 --> 00:27:32.170
And there's some disagreement
about whether the statues

00:27:32.170 --> 00:27:34.440
actually had some
moving parts that might

00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:36.290
invoke their head a little bit.

00:27:36.290 --> 00:27:38.330
That is probably unlikely.

00:27:38.330 --> 00:27:40.980
More likely is that
the statue in its bark

00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:43.990
would be brought by the
priests either forward

00:27:43.990 --> 00:27:46.240
to say yes or
backwards to say no.

00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:48.180
Or perhaps lean to
one side or another,

00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:50.870
if there were two competing
petitions brought.

00:27:50.870 --> 00:27:54.690
And this is how the god would
signal approval or disapproval.

00:27:54.690 --> 00:27:55.860
-OK.

00:27:55.860 --> 00:27:57.610
Don't you like the
bobblehead idea?

00:27:57.610 --> 00:27:58.110
Yeah.

00:27:58.110 --> 00:27:58.720
OK.

00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:00.100
Anyway.

00:28:00.100 --> 00:28:03.840
But the priests were clearly
in control of that system.

00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:05.840
Now I'm going to say
several times that we've

00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:08.800
had to be very opportunistic
about what people at Harvard

00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:10.760
and people we know are
interested and expert

00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:14.290
on in creating all the
material for this course.

00:28:14.290 --> 00:28:17.470
Because I'll show you just how
many systems for divination

00:28:17.470 --> 00:28:18.220
there might be.

00:28:18.220 --> 00:28:23.320
And I'm not going to show you--
this is clips from about 10%

00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:24.950
of the video that we have.

00:28:24.950 --> 00:28:27.450
There's hundreds of videos.

00:28:27.450 --> 00:28:30.940
And so I'm only going to
show you just a very few.

00:28:30.940 --> 00:28:33.270
But I am going to give credit
to all of the people who

00:28:33.270 --> 00:28:36.840
have so far participated, and
there's about this many again

00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:39.500
who have promised to
participate in the more

00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:40.860
modern pieces of the course.

00:28:40.860 --> 00:28:43.100
And so, again, many of
these people are here today.

00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:46.411
And you can meet a lot
of them at the reception.

00:28:46.411 --> 00:28:48.160
So now let me just
show you a little piece

00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:50.493
where I'm trying to highlight
different parts of Harvard

00:28:50.493 --> 00:28:51.920
that we used in the course, too.

00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:54.211
So I want to show you a piece
that we filmed in the art

00:28:54.211 --> 00:28:57.590
museum where they went and got
a special little codex for Laura

00:28:57.590 --> 00:29:00.100
Nasrallah, who's a Professor
at the Divinity School,

00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:01.880
out of storage so
that she could tell us

00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:03.394
how it was used in predictions.

00:29:03.394 --> 00:29:04.060
Let me show you.

00:29:04.060 --> 00:29:09.070
-The text is titled The
Gospel of the Lots of Mary.

00:29:09.070 --> 00:29:11.351
And within it, it
contains multiple oracles.

00:29:11.351 --> 00:29:13.350
And we're not really sure
how it would have been

00:29:13.350 --> 00:29:15.430
used, to tell you the truth.

00:29:15.430 --> 00:29:18.070
What's clear is that someone
held it in their hand.

00:29:18.070 --> 00:29:19.750
And if you look
closely at the text,

00:29:19.750 --> 00:29:22.240
you can see that it's
been well thumbed.

00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:26.560
The middle as each page
is dark with the stains

00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:29.210
of sweat and dirt
from a ritual expert

00:29:29.210 --> 00:29:31.260
who would have
held it and thumbed

00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:33.870
through the pages,
trying to find an answer

00:29:33.870 --> 00:29:36.410
to the petitioner's question.

00:29:36.410 --> 00:29:36.910
-Yeah.

00:29:36.910 --> 00:29:39.740
So that's basically
open to a random page

00:29:39.740 --> 00:29:42.930
and then the expert would
explain what that means.

00:29:42.930 --> 00:29:46.150
So that's another one of
these randomizing systems.

00:29:46.150 --> 00:29:49.740
So, if you remember,
I talked about how

00:29:49.740 --> 00:29:52.130
we have these systems
for pedagogical view.

00:29:52.130 --> 00:29:54.050
So one of the important
ones that I haven't

00:29:54.050 --> 00:29:56.000
mentioned to you
yet is this concept

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:57.540
of so-called Golden Threads.

00:29:57.540 --> 00:29:58.040
OK.

00:29:58.040 --> 00:29:59.956
And now I'm not going
to read all of this now.

00:29:59.956 --> 00:30:02.350
You can go take
the course online.

00:30:02.350 --> 00:30:04.920
But I'm just going to
focus on one of them, which

00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:06.890
is called our need to know.

00:30:06.890 --> 00:30:09.570
And so it's this idea that
people just psychologically

00:30:09.570 --> 00:30:12.050
have always wanted
to know their future.

00:30:12.050 --> 00:30:13.960
And I love this
little section where

00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:17.130
David Carrasco, who is a
professor at the Divinity

00:30:17.130 --> 00:30:19.820
School, also explains
to Rowan Flad who's here

00:30:19.820 --> 00:30:25.350
and Jacob Olupona who's here
how the Mayan culture thought

00:30:25.350 --> 00:30:27.320
about this need
for humans to know.

00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:29.780
So I'm just going to play
this little clip for you.

00:30:29.780 --> 00:30:32.860
-What you have is a
mythology, some stories that

00:30:32.860 --> 00:30:35.587
say, in the beginning, when
human beings were created,

00:30:35.587 --> 00:30:37.170
they could see as
well as the deities.

00:30:37.170 --> 00:30:38.680
They could all see everything.

00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:42.240
And they had this vision to
penetrate great distances.

00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:46.850
And then the gods, they didn't
like this about human beings.

00:30:46.850 --> 00:30:49.260
So what they did
was they created

00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:51.630
what is called-- like
breath on a mirror.

00:30:51.630 --> 00:30:55.266
They breathed on
the eyes of humans

00:30:55.266 --> 00:30:57.640
so that they could no longer
see in this penetrating way.

00:30:57.640 --> 00:30:58.764
-I feel that way sometimes.

00:30:58.764 --> 00:31:00.320
-Yeah.

00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:02.380
And therefore, what
you need is people

00:31:02.380 --> 00:31:04.630
who have been through this
training in order to do it.

00:31:04.630 --> 00:31:06.338
Now, the other thing
that Jacob said that

00:31:06.338 --> 00:31:08.690
was interesting, this
idea of opening the door.

00:31:08.690 --> 00:31:11.046
This opening the door.

00:31:11.046 --> 00:31:12.570
And the idea is the same.

00:31:12.570 --> 00:31:14.480
It's that you open
a door of vision.

00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:17.630
You open a door of
being able to see.

00:31:17.630 --> 00:31:18.130
-OK.

00:31:18.130 --> 00:31:20.824
So this-- I love this
idea that at first we

00:31:20.824 --> 00:31:22.990
were just like the gods and
we could see everything.

00:31:22.990 --> 00:31:24.100
And then the gods were, no, no.

00:31:24.100 --> 00:31:24.870
This isn't fair.

00:31:24.870 --> 00:31:27.060
I'm going to make it really
hard for them to see.

00:31:27.060 --> 00:31:29.850
And so then the idea is that
all of these ancient systems

00:31:29.850 --> 00:31:32.350
are sort of ways to
see past that fog.

00:31:32.350 --> 00:31:35.590
And it turns out that that
idea exists in many cultures.

00:31:35.590 --> 00:31:37.990
It's not all about gods
breathing on a mirror,

00:31:37.990 --> 00:31:39.860
but it's very much like that.

00:31:39.860 --> 00:31:42.220
A gentleman came up to me
just before I started talking

00:31:42.220 --> 00:31:46.920
and asked if we had included
divination by patterns

00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:48.810
in the sand on the beach.

00:31:48.810 --> 00:31:50.270
And I said, no, I'm sorry.

00:31:50.270 --> 00:31:52.650
We've really had to
be very opportunistic.

00:31:52.650 --> 00:31:56.190
And if you go look at
this web page, which

00:31:56.190 --> 00:31:58.620
may be my favorite
Wikipedia page,

00:31:58.620 --> 00:32:01.000
called Methods Of Divination.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:03.205
It goes on-- we'll
just wait here--

00:32:03.205 --> 00:32:06.870
for like hundreds of
methods of divination.

00:32:06.870 --> 00:32:10.000
And I don't have my glasses,
but let me try here.

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.090
What does that say here?

00:32:12.090 --> 00:32:14.710
Divination by fish behavior.

00:32:14.710 --> 00:32:15.370
OK.

00:32:15.370 --> 00:32:19.700
Anyway there is every kind of
divination you could ever want.

00:32:19.700 --> 00:32:24.690
And so I apologize again that
we are not covering all of them.

00:32:24.690 --> 00:32:25.650
OK.

00:32:25.650 --> 00:32:27.630
We are, however,
taking opportunities

00:32:27.630 --> 00:32:29.640
to involve students at Harvard.

00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:32.120
And in particularly, we have
involved a lot of freshman.

00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:34.402
And so I've taught
two freshman seminars.

00:32:34.402 --> 00:32:36.610
Some of the freshman seminar
students are here today.

00:32:36.610 --> 00:32:38.210
You can ask them
how they liked it.

00:32:38.210 --> 00:32:42.330
And we not only discussed
all of the concepts and ideas

00:32:42.330 --> 00:32:45.170
and history in the
course, but we also

00:32:45.170 --> 00:32:46.390
got to go on field trips.

00:32:46.390 --> 00:32:50.810
And so we-- ask me again about
that tent, the divination tent.

00:32:50.810 --> 00:32:53.090
We visited the collection
of historical scientific

00:32:53.090 --> 00:32:53.704
instruments.

00:32:53.704 --> 00:32:55.620
Sara Schechner has been
tremendously involved,

00:32:55.620 --> 00:32:59.280
she's the curator
there, in this course.

00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:02.350
And Emily Hartman hosted
us at the Houghton Library

00:33:02.350 --> 00:33:04.620
to see all kinds of
crazy manuscripts

00:33:04.620 --> 00:33:06.010
and beautiful drawings.

00:33:06.010 --> 00:33:10.010
And maybe my personal favorite
is Timothy Leary's typewritten

00:33:10.010 --> 00:33:13.210
manuscript explaining
the tarot cards

00:33:13.210 --> 00:33:17.600
deck is an ancient formula
of neurogenetic symbols which

00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:19.690
has been passed
down over centuries,

00:33:19.690 --> 00:33:21.070
et cetera, et cetera.

00:33:21.070 --> 00:33:24.300
And so Timothy Leary,
while taking LSD I believe,

00:33:24.300 --> 00:33:30.780
was-- I'm serious-- was also
experimenting with tarot cards

00:33:30.780 --> 00:33:32.350
and their value.

00:33:32.350 --> 00:33:35.480
And then I'm actually going
to skip the video of Rowan

00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:38.470
doing the oracle bones because
he's actually here to show you

00:33:38.470 --> 00:33:39.450
the oracle bones later.

00:33:39.450 --> 00:33:41.980
Although I don't believe
there's actual fire involved.

00:33:41.980 --> 00:33:43.190
But Mike is here.

00:33:43.190 --> 00:33:45.580
Yes, Mike, we did use the
Science Center lecture

00:33:45.580 --> 00:33:48.590
hall to set bones on fire.

00:33:48.590 --> 00:33:51.110
The lectures staff--
the lab staff

00:33:51.110 --> 00:33:53.600
really liked that when I
said, can we make a fire.

00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:54.640
Anyway.

00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:55.250
Yeah.

00:33:55.250 --> 00:33:59.230
So I should also mention
that this year, I

00:33:59.230 --> 00:34:02.467
am incredibly privileged
not only to be a fellow here

00:34:02.467 --> 00:34:05.050
at Radcliffe, but Radcliffe has
this thing called the Research

00:34:05.050 --> 00:34:05.862
Partners Program.

00:34:05.862 --> 00:34:07.320
And so I think some
of the students

00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:08.699
from that are here too.

00:34:08.699 --> 00:34:10.695
Those are all year
students at Harvard.

00:34:10.695 --> 00:34:13.070
And they sign up for projects
that they're interested in.

00:34:13.070 --> 00:34:16.389
So we have seven students
now working on this project,

00:34:16.389 --> 00:34:19.340
on all the different aspects of
the project that you see here.

00:34:19.340 --> 00:34:20.840
And I'm just going
to focus on one

00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:23.135
because I want to talk about
philosophy for a minute.

00:34:23.135 --> 00:34:25.260
So we have one student,
[? Philip ?] [? Chaudry, ?]

00:34:25.260 --> 00:34:28.850
who's looking at the philosophy
of prediction over time.

00:34:28.850 --> 00:34:30.449
And the moment
that did it for me

00:34:30.449 --> 00:34:33.949
when I understood how bad
it is to impose 21st century

00:34:33.949 --> 00:34:37.870
values on ancient times
was this moment right here

00:34:37.870 --> 00:34:41.719
when I asked the
potentially stupid question

00:34:41.719 --> 00:34:44.310
of a real historian, Emma
Dench, whether or not

00:34:44.310 --> 00:34:48.050
people like Aristotle actually
believed in the Greek gods.

00:34:48.050 --> 00:34:50.690
And this is a very
controversial question.

00:34:50.690 --> 00:34:53.010
She gave me the answer
you're about to see.

00:34:53.010 --> 00:34:56.112
But ask what answer Steven
Weinberg would give later

00:34:56.112 --> 00:34:56.820
in the questions.

00:34:56.820 --> 00:34:58.370
But I'll show you Emma's answer.

00:34:58.370 --> 00:35:02.660
-In Greek and Roman antiquity,
not to believe that the gods--

00:35:02.660 --> 00:35:04.690
that there are signs
from the gods--

00:35:04.690 --> 00:35:05.450
-That is heresy.

00:35:05.450 --> 00:35:07.250
- --would be-- no,
it's not heresy.

00:35:07.250 --> 00:35:09.570
It's like-- it would
be about the same level

00:35:09.570 --> 00:35:14.130
as saying that I don't believe--
I absolutely don't believe--

00:35:14.130 --> 00:35:16.330
anything that science tells us.

00:35:16.330 --> 00:35:18.320
It would be about the same.

00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:20.370
-So we went on in
that conversation.

00:35:20.370 --> 00:35:21.870
And I said, so you
mean like I would

00:35:21.870 --> 00:35:23.660
say I don't believe in gravity.

00:35:23.660 --> 00:35:24.860
She said yes.

00:35:24.860 --> 00:35:25.480
OK.

00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:28.150
And so the idea of believing
in something that was just

00:35:28.150 --> 00:35:29.980
part of your culture
and part of your being

00:35:29.980 --> 00:35:32.930
and your understanding
is something

00:35:32.930 --> 00:35:35.420
that depends on the
cultural context.

00:35:35.420 --> 00:35:38.746
And I really have learned
that in creating this course.

00:35:38.746 --> 00:35:40.120
OK, so let's move
on a little bit

00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:42.870
to the second piece and
talk about this path

00:35:42.870 --> 00:35:45.930
to Newton and navigation.

00:35:45.930 --> 00:35:48.710
Before I do that, and this
is with apologies to Owen,

00:35:48.710 --> 00:35:50.640
I added this little
note here that says,

00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:52.730
diagrams are not to scale.

00:35:52.730 --> 00:35:54.990
The best historian of
science in the world

00:35:54.990 --> 00:35:56.790
and of astronomy--
sorry, of astronomy,

00:35:56.790 --> 00:36:00.020
I don't insult your colleagues,
Owen-- is here, Owen Gingerich.

00:36:00.020 --> 00:36:01.980
And when I made this
slide, he said, oh no,

00:36:01.980 --> 00:36:03.410
that's not to scale.

00:36:03.410 --> 00:36:04.770
And indeed it's not.

00:36:04.770 --> 00:36:05.270
OK.

00:36:05.270 --> 00:36:07.440
But this is just this
for the non-astronomers

00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:09.670
here to understand what
we mean by epicycles

00:36:09.670 --> 00:36:12.110
and how the solar
system really works.

00:36:12.110 --> 00:36:14.100
So this picture in the
middle here-- maybe we

00:36:14.100 --> 00:36:16.700
can turn the lights down just
a little bit so people can see.

00:36:16.700 --> 00:36:19.281
But the picture in the middle
is how the solar system really

00:36:19.281 --> 00:36:19.780
works.

00:36:19.780 --> 00:36:22.567
I'm sure you all know this,
but the sun is in the middle.

00:36:22.567 --> 00:36:24.650
The earth and the other
planets go around the sun.

00:36:24.650 --> 00:36:26.770
And the moons of the
planets go around them.

00:36:26.770 --> 00:36:27.380
OK?

00:36:27.380 --> 00:36:29.830
And Copernicus had that right.

00:36:29.830 --> 00:36:32.320
And it wasn't until
Galileo, later,

00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:36.880
that it was demonstrated
in a very interesting way

00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:39.230
that I unfortunately don't
have to tell you about today.

00:36:39.230 --> 00:36:43.520
But interestingly, before that
I mentioned epicycles before.

00:36:43.520 --> 00:36:47.250
And from 150 AD-- from
the time of Ptolemy--

00:36:47.250 --> 00:36:50.889
on, people believed that
the earth was-- well,

00:36:50.889 --> 00:36:53.180
Aristotle also believe that
the Earth was in the center

00:36:53.180 --> 00:36:55.721
of-- not just the solar system,
but the universe because that

00:36:55.721 --> 00:36:57.050
was the same thing.

00:36:57.050 --> 00:37:00.270
But then in order to get the
observations to work out,

00:37:00.270 --> 00:37:02.320
yeah, you can have the
sun go around the Earth.

00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:04.750
But then you have to do
all kinds of crazy things

00:37:04.750 --> 00:37:08.350
with the other planets to have
epicycles-- little circles--

00:37:08.350 --> 00:37:10.940
that they go in as they
go around the Earth

00:37:10.940 --> 00:37:13.777
to make the projection of that
system work out on the sky.

00:37:13.777 --> 00:37:15.610
So this is what I mean
that you collect data

00:37:15.610 --> 00:37:17.520
and you can have
empirical theories, which

00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:20.410
is math that lets
you make predictions,

00:37:20.410 --> 00:37:22.501
but they're not based
on a physical theory.

00:37:22.501 --> 00:37:23.000
OK?

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:24.090
They're just math.

00:37:24.090 --> 00:37:27.040
And so this kind of
epicycles does work.

00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:30.040
And then in order to get around
this problem of the Earth

00:37:30.040 --> 00:37:33.460
philosophically being not at the
center of the universe, which

00:37:33.460 --> 00:37:36.780
was very bad, Tycho
Brahe preferred

00:37:36.780 --> 00:37:40.230
this-- in my opinion--
craziest system

00:37:40.230 --> 00:37:41.990
where the Earth
is in the middle.

00:37:41.990 --> 00:37:43.590
The moon goes around the Earth.

00:37:43.590 --> 00:37:45.640
And then the sun and
all the other planets

00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:48.960
go around the Earth.

00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:51.130
No comment.

00:37:51.130 --> 00:37:53.510
But anyway, so that's
as recently as 1587.

00:37:53.510 --> 00:37:55.020
And then Galileo,
who I'm not really

00:37:55.020 --> 00:37:56.603
going to talk about
very much, but who

00:37:56.603 --> 00:37:59.820
we have a beautiful piece on,
put an end to that pretty much

00:37:59.820 --> 00:38:01.740
in about 1610.

00:38:01.740 --> 00:38:04.180
So that was just a little
cheat sheet for you.

00:38:04.180 --> 00:38:06.250
And I'm going to show
you little bits of video.

00:38:06.250 --> 00:38:09.930
And I'm not going to explain
this incredibly messy diagram

00:38:09.930 --> 00:38:10.700
on the blackboard.

00:38:10.700 --> 00:38:13.170
But I just want to show you
what we do with HarvardX.

00:38:13.170 --> 00:38:15.030
So one day, it was
like, all right,

00:38:15.030 --> 00:38:18.275
let me trace out the entire
path from the Babylonians

00:38:18.275 --> 00:38:21.630
and the Greeks all the way
to how we solved navigation.

00:38:21.630 --> 00:38:24.052
And, you know, what did
Copernicus and Newton do along

00:38:24.052 --> 00:38:25.010
the way, and et cetera.

00:38:25.010 --> 00:38:27.130
And again, we can talk
about that in the questions

00:38:27.130 --> 00:38:30.310
because this would take two
hours to fully explain this.

00:38:30.310 --> 00:38:33.840
So instead, I'm just going to
show you some clips of a dinner

00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:36.530
party that we had
at my house where

00:38:36.530 --> 00:38:39.740
I was very privileged to
have Owen and Sara, the two

00:38:39.740 --> 00:38:43.400
local experts, over in
addition to John Hughes who's

00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:46.010
also here somewhere, who's
a professor of physics, yes.

00:38:46.010 --> 00:38:50.350
And also our science-- one of
the co-directors of science

00:38:50.350 --> 00:38:51.610
here at Radcliffe.

00:38:51.610 --> 00:38:53.920
They came over with
Dava Sobel, who

00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:55.460
wrote this book
about the longitude

00:38:55.460 --> 00:38:57.939
that we'll come to later when
we talk about navigation.

00:38:57.939 --> 00:38:59.230
Some of you may have read that.

00:38:59.230 --> 00:39:00.980
And also Curtis
Wang, my friend who

00:39:00.980 --> 00:39:02.490
invented WorldWide Telescope.

00:39:02.490 --> 00:39:05.020
And so let me just show you
a few clips from that dinner

00:39:05.020 --> 00:39:07.670
party because I forgot to
mention that sometimes we

00:39:07.670 --> 00:39:11.290
call this course an
academic reality show.

00:39:11.290 --> 00:39:13.350
Because we're trying to
make it a little bit more

00:39:13.350 --> 00:39:15.029
like real conversations
that people

00:39:15.029 --> 00:39:16.820
who are interested in
each other's subjects

00:39:16.820 --> 00:39:18.528
would have-- sort of
like what's supposed

00:39:18.528 --> 00:39:21.700
to go on at Radcliffe-- than a
perfectly edited documentary.

00:39:21.700 --> 00:39:25.080
So here's just a little
bit of it, edited.

00:39:25.080 --> 00:39:25.702
Here you go.

00:39:25.702 --> 00:39:28.160
We took out the part where the
cat walked across the table.

00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:31.540
-When did people tried
to figure out how

00:39:31.540 --> 00:39:33.720
to explain celestial motion?

00:39:33.720 --> 00:39:39.430
-The Babylonians had a
predictive system of sorts,

00:39:39.430 --> 00:39:42.880
but they couldn't
follow the planets

00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:48.290
all the way through their
cycles in any theoretical base.

00:39:48.290 --> 00:39:52.150
But what they discovered
was that if they picked

00:39:52.150 --> 00:39:57.440
the right period-- maybe
45 years, maybe 60 years--

00:39:57.440 --> 00:40:01.140
you could get, let us say
Mars, coming back and going

00:40:01.140 --> 00:40:06.310
through the same general motions
that they had seen before.

00:40:06.310 --> 00:40:07.987
-Isn't that their
kind of association,

00:40:07.987 --> 00:40:09.820
that these good things
or bad things happen?

00:40:09.820 --> 00:40:12.140
And they happen when they
notice that a planet is

00:40:12.140 --> 00:40:13.220
in a particular position.

00:40:13.220 --> 00:40:16.090
And is that any kind of
prediction point, to be able

00:40:16.090 --> 00:40:18.990
say watch out for when Mars is
there in that position again?

00:40:18.990 --> 00:40:25.780
-Certainly there are omens,
and things to look out for.

00:40:25.780 --> 00:40:27.670
-And I'm not showing
you again, today,

00:40:27.670 --> 00:40:30.169
that we let people reproduce--
all of the comments that

00:40:30.169 --> 00:40:32.210
are made about astronomy,
they can reproduce them

00:40:32.210 --> 00:40:36.190
in this WorldWide
Telescope program online.

00:40:36.190 --> 00:40:36.690
OK.

00:40:36.690 --> 00:40:40.580
So I gave an entire talk on
Radcliffe's behalf in a series

00:40:40.580 --> 00:40:43.440
that John Hughes organized
called Navigation Lecture

00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:44.270
Series.

00:40:44.270 --> 00:40:46.724
And I'm not going to give
you that entire talk now.

00:40:46.724 --> 00:40:49.140
I'm just going to tell you
that there's another issue that

00:40:49.140 --> 00:40:53.310
comes right after Newton
where the British empire,

00:40:53.310 --> 00:40:55.190
and other empires
mostly in Europe,

00:40:55.190 --> 00:40:57.220
are trying to expand
around the world.

00:40:57.220 --> 00:40:59.380
And what's stopping them
from being able to expand

00:40:59.380 --> 00:41:01.646
is all these ships
getting lost at sea.

00:41:01.646 --> 00:41:03.520
And the reason that the
ships get lost at sea

00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:05.500
is because using the
stars, it turns out

00:41:05.500 --> 00:41:07.390
to be pretty easy to
find your latitude--

00:41:07.390 --> 00:41:09.280
so how far North, South you are.

00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:11.650
But because the Earth
just spins on its axis

00:41:11.650 --> 00:41:13.560
and there is no natural
reference point,

00:41:13.560 --> 00:41:15.450
it's very hard to
find your longitude.

00:41:15.450 --> 00:41:17.109
And so this is an
obscure problem

00:41:17.109 --> 00:41:19.400
that not a lot of people
today even know was a problem.

00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:23.280
But just trust me that at the
time that this was a problem,

00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:26.010
it was like trying to
find a cure for cancer

00:41:26.010 --> 00:41:27.610
in the early 1700s.

00:41:27.610 --> 00:41:30.720
And there was something called
the Longitude prize which

00:41:30.720 --> 00:41:32.650
was ultimately won
by a clock maker,

00:41:32.650 --> 00:41:35.500
not by the astronomers,
who figured out

00:41:35.500 --> 00:41:37.850
a method for finding
your longitude at sea

00:41:37.850 --> 00:41:40.710
using the motion of the Earth
and very accurate clocks.

00:41:40.710 --> 00:41:43.110
So again, we can talk
about that later.

00:41:43.110 --> 00:41:44.540
But for now, let
me just show you

00:41:44.540 --> 00:41:46.570
a little bit of what
that part of the course

00:41:46.570 --> 00:41:49.300
will look like using
some highlights

00:41:49.300 --> 00:41:54.530
from the original lecture
I gave last year about it.

00:41:54.530 --> 00:41:56.140
So this is the book, by the way.

00:41:56.140 --> 00:42:00.380
This is the famous book about
the longitude that Dava wrote,

00:42:00.380 --> 00:42:02.740
which by the way has
an illustrated edition

00:42:02.740 --> 00:42:06.340
with illustrations helped
out by Will Andrews, who

00:42:06.340 --> 00:42:08.490
used to be the curator
of Historical Scientific

00:42:08.490 --> 00:42:09.430
Instruments here.

00:42:09.430 --> 00:42:12.132
And the whole story of this book
started at Harvard, as well.

00:42:12.132 --> 00:42:13.840
And Dava will be
visiting Radcliffe again

00:42:13.840 --> 00:42:14.520
later this year.

00:42:14.520 --> 00:42:16.340
So more about that, too.

00:42:16.340 --> 00:42:17.680
So here's the problem.

00:42:17.680 --> 00:42:21.660
Let's say you're out at sea and
you want to know where you are.

00:42:21.660 --> 00:42:22.490
No problem.

00:42:22.490 --> 00:42:25.055
You have your trusty iPhone.

00:42:25.055 --> 00:42:25.555
OK?

00:42:25.555 --> 00:42:26.830
And you just turn it on.

00:42:26.830 --> 00:42:27.860
You get the GPS.

00:42:27.860 --> 00:42:29.540
I don't care that it's dark.

00:42:29.540 --> 00:42:30.240
No problem.

00:42:30.240 --> 00:42:32.390
Light out, dark
out, doesn't matter.

00:42:32.390 --> 00:42:33.603
But, oh, wait a minute.

00:42:33.603 --> 00:42:34.600
Oh.

00:42:34.600 --> 00:42:35.480
Big problem.

00:42:35.480 --> 00:42:37.810
What I'm going to do now?

00:42:37.810 --> 00:42:42.680
Well, hm, when I'm
on land the way

00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:45.440
most people navigate
is by landmarks.

00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:47.650
The sort of natural way
that people navigate

00:42:47.650 --> 00:42:50.151
is by knowing oh, those
mountains are over there.

00:42:50.151 --> 00:42:51.400
I went around those mountains.

00:42:51.400 --> 00:42:53.483
Now I have to go to the
next mountains, et cetera.

00:42:53.483 --> 00:42:56.620
And a lot of people don't
even notice the movement

00:42:56.620 --> 00:42:58.540
of stars on the sky.

00:42:58.540 --> 00:43:01.630
But when you take away all the
landmarks and you're at sea,

00:43:01.630 --> 00:43:04.170
you can only see the
motions of stars on the sky.

00:43:04.170 --> 00:43:05.670
And you better know
a lot about that

00:43:05.670 --> 00:43:07.889
if you want to use
them to navigate.

00:43:07.889 --> 00:43:09.930
And like I said before,
the height at that point,

00:43:09.930 --> 00:43:11.790
where you see all the
stars going around,

00:43:11.790 --> 00:43:16.690
North Star, and the height that
stars reach on a given night,

00:43:16.690 --> 00:43:19.787
can actually tell you where
you are, what latitude.

00:43:19.787 --> 00:43:21.370
But you need something
else, something

00:43:21.370 --> 00:43:23.820
that isn't so symmetric,
to tell you the longitude.

00:43:23.820 --> 00:43:27.520
And that again is difficult.
But we have three demonstrations

00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:29.900
that are listed on the
back here at the reception

00:43:29.900 --> 00:43:32.350
after this talk where you
can talk to the experts

00:43:32.350 --> 00:43:34.270
about how this
problem was solved.

00:43:34.270 --> 00:43:36.760
And instead, I'm just going
to tell you a little bit more

00:43:36.760 --> 00:43:37.950
about what we'll
be talking about.

00:43:37.950 --> 00:43:39.950
And then I'll show a
little bit of sample video.

00:43:39.950 --> 00:43:42.780
And I'll be done in
five or six minutes.

00:43:42.780 --> 00:43:47.180
So anyway, in order to figure
out where you are at sea,

00:43:47.180 --> 00:43:49.630
you need a combination of
these things-- you need math,

00:43:49.630 --> 00:43:51.427
you need some way to
measure your speed,

00:43:51.427 --> 00:43:53.260
you need some way to
very accurately measure

00:43:53.260 --> 00:43:55.790
the positions of
stars, to keep time,

00:43:55.790 --> 00:43:57.350
to know what direction
you're going,

00:43:57.350 --> 00:43:59.230
and to know where
you are on a map.

00:43:59.230 --> 00:43:59.790
OK?

00:43:59.790 --> 00:44:03.020
And the problem was that a
very long time ago-- this

00:44:03.020 --> 00:44:06.064
is a sort of schematic graph
of the uncertainty associated

00:44:06.064 --> 00:44:08.480
with each of those kinds of
measurements, which by the way

00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:10.440
is being improved
with accurate images.

00:44:10.440 --> 00:44:12.040
Thank you, Sara.

00:44:12.040 --> 00:44:15.730
But anyway, the uncertainty
was tremendously large.

00:44:15.730 --> 00:44:17.230
And then it got
smaller and smaller.

00:44:17.230 --> 00:44:19.740
But it was hard to take a
grandfather clock to sea,

00:44:19.740 --> 00:44:21.700
so we'll talk about that later.

00:44:21.700 --> 00:44:23.230
And I see Phil Sadler here, too.

00:44:23.230 --> 00:44:25.900
He should contribute to our--
he's our expert on navigation,

00:44:25.900 --> 00:44:27.600
teaches navigation at Harvard.

00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:29.550
So Phil you're going
to the demo table.

00:44:29.550 --> 00:44:30.520
Thank you, very much.

00:44:30.520 --> 00:44:32.010
So Phil will
explain all of this,

00:44:32.010 --> 00:44:33.420
along with our other experts.

00:44:33.420 --> 00:44:34.720
And it got better and better.

00:44:34.720 --> 00:44:36.300
This is John Harrison's
clock that he

00:44:36.300 --> 00:44:37.630
made to solve the problem.

00:44:37.630 --> 00:44:40.100
And the reason that we don't
understand this problem now is

00:44:40.100 --> 00:44:42.690
because we basically have no
uncertainty in all of those

00:44:42.690 --> 00:44:46.512
things, as long as the
[INTERPOSING VOICES] So

00:44:46.512 --> 00:44:47.760
here's some old--

00:44:47.760 --> 00:44:48.860
-And I'll start with this.

00:44:48.860 --> 00:44:51.030
This is an octant.

00:44:51.030 --> 00:44:54.940
It's made about 1800.

00:44:54.940 --> 00:44:58.980
And it's made of wood
and has an ivory scale

00:44:58.980 --> 00:45:00.650
here with [INAUDIBLE].

00:45:00.650 --> 00:45:04.500
And my favorite part about
octants of this period

00:45:04.500 --> 00:45:08.670
is they often come with this
handy little pencil that

00:45:08.670 --> 00:45:11.310
sits in here, comes out.

00:45:11.310 --> 00:45:14.100
And so you make
your observation,

00:45:14.100 --> 00:45:16.580
and then you say, oh, OK.

00:45:16.580 --> 00:45:18.300
That's 23 and 1/2 degrees.

00:45:18.300 --> 00:45:22.520
And then on the back here,
you have this handy little pad

00:45:22.520 --> 00:45:25.690
made of ivory where you
scribble down your observation.

00:45:25.690 --> 00:45:28.910
Because on a deck of a ship
where it's windy and wet,

00:45:28.910 --> 00:45:31.530
you're not going to have
a paper lying around.

00:45:31.530 --> 00:45:34.320
It's just-- it's handy.

00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:36.600
-So that is one of
thousands of instruments

00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:39.680
that Sarah can show you in
our collection, many of which

00:45:39.680 --> 00:45:41.439
are not even out on display.

00:45:41.439 --> 00:45:43.730
They're in the basement of
the Science Center, which is

00:45:43.730 --> 00:45:46.681
an incredible treasure trove.

00:45:46.681 --> 00:45:48.680
And then let me show you
a little bit more here.

00:45:48.680 --> 00:45:51.590
-To successfully
use the lunar orbit,

00:45:51.590 --> 00:45:55.270
you had to solve the
so-called three body problem.

00:45:55.270 --> 00:46:00.200
And Newton took a crack
at it, but his-- turns out

00:46:00.200 --> 00:46:02.670
that his calculations were off.

00:46:02.670 --> 00:46:06.660
It was recognized that if you
have a sort of full-on three

00:46:06.660 --> 00:46:09.650
body problem, it's basically
impossible to solve.

00:46:09.650 --> 00:46:11.150
-Just as the
physicists in the room,

00:46:11.150 --> 00:46:13.210
let's just make sure
everybody knows why.

00:46:13.210 --> 00:46:13.760
OK?

00:46:13.760 --> 00:46:15.210
So we have this glass--

00:46:15.210 --> 00:46:16.720
-We have two glasses.

00:46:16.720 --> 00:46:18.200
-And then we have a tea cup.

00:46:18.200 --> 00:46:19.020
All right.

00:46:19.020 --> 00:46:21.540
And so, now you make your
glass orbit the other glass.

00:46:21.540 --> 00:46:23.710
-So you can solve this
motion of the two glasses--

00:46:23.710 --> 00:46:24.210
-Oh, no.

00:46:24.210 --> 00:46:26.300
I'm coming through here, but
I'm affecting the other things,

00:46:26.300 --> 00:46:27.341
and they're affecting me.

00:46:27.341 --> 00:46:29.010
And I can't update
all of these things

00:46:29.010 --> 00:46:31.330
at the same time [INAUDIBLE].

00:46:31.330 --> 00:46:34.132
So I can't just write
down some equation.

00:46:34.132 --> 00:46:36.090
-OK, so we're trying to
explain why that is not

00:46:36.090 --> 00:46:37.420
a deterministic problem.

00:46:37.420 --> 00:46:39.190
And if you keep
going in the video,

00:46:39.190 --> 00:46:41.540
you get a little bit
more explanation.

00:46:41.540 --> 00:46:44.040
And then, of course, they'll
be like a companion interactive

00:46:44.040 --> 00:46:46.310
that has a little
three body simulation

00:46:46.310 --> 00:46:50.520
and lets students play with
it, not glasses and teacups.

00:46:50.520 --> 00:46:51.020
OK.

00:46:51.020 --> 00:46:53.130
And so last, but
certainly not least,

00:46:53.130 --> 00:46:54.860
I want to be sure
to thank HarvardX

00:46:54.860 --> 00:46:57.930
and explain what this
has allowed us to do.

00:46:57.930 --> 00:47:00.870
So I mentioned a little bit
about how we went to London

00:47:00.870 --> 00:47:04.280
and I interviewed the person who
started the John Snow Society.

00:47:04.280 --> 00:47:06.680
That's Rosalind Stanwell Smith.

00:47:06.680 --> 00:47:09.950
We also got to go to all these
other places in conjunction

00:47:09.950 --> 00:47:14.020
with the Isaac, path to
Newton, and the longitude

00:47:14.020 --> 00:47:15.060
part of the course.

00:47:15.060 --> 00:47:18.800
And I just have to tell you that
the reason I look so incredibly

00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:24.250
happy-- how many of you
know what the Principia is?

00:47:24.250 --> 00:47:25.394
OK.

00:47:25.394 --> 00:47:27.560
For those of you, that half
of you who don't, that's

00:47:27.560 --> 00:47:31.140
Newton's manuscript where he
laid out his theory of gravity.

00:47:31.140 --> 00:47:35.470
This is the Principia, not
a copy of the Principia.

00:47:35.470 --> 00:47:38.750
This is Newton's copy,
with [? Halle's ?] notes

00:47:38.750 --> 00:47:40.310
scribbled in the
margins, which I

00:47:40.310 --> 00:47:43.450
got to hold in the archives
of the Royal Society.

00:47:43.450 --> 00:47:46.610
So this is like, for a
physicist, that's nirvana.

00:47:46.610 --> 00:47:47.380
OK?

00:47:47.380 --> 00:47:49.350
So this was very, very exciting.

00:47:49.350 --> 00:47:52.840
This, by the way, is a
letter to [? Halle ?] asking

00:47:52.840 --> 00:47:54.540
for some money for somebody.

00:47:54.540 --> 00:47:56.500
And one of the letters
that I'm not showing you

00:47:56.500 --> 00:47:58.460
is Newton sending a
proposal saying, you know,

00:47:58.460 --> 00:48:00.947
I have this idea for a
new kind of telescope.

00:48:00.947 --> 00:48:03.530
And the astronomers in the room
will think this is very funny.

00:48:03.530 --> 00:48:06.150
And it's basically a proposal,
like I need 100 pounds

00:48:06.150 --> 00:48:08.920
so I can build this thing.

00:48:08.920 --> 00:48:10.530
Anyway, so I've
given you, hopefully,

00:48:10.530 --> 00:48:14.010
some sense of most of
the pieces of the course.

00:48:14.010 --> 00:48:16.800
And I just want to mention
one or possibly two,

00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:18.790
but I think one
more thing, which

00:48:18.790 --> 00:48:21.630
is we're actually-- in
conjunction with the course--

00:48:21.630 --> 00:48:24.680
building a new standard for
time tagging information.

00:48:24.680 --> 00:48:27.390
This is my interest in
data that Judy mentioned.

00:48:27.390 --> 00:48:31.160
Turns out that in order to
automatically add information

00:48:31.160 --> 00:48:34.890
to automated timelines
that students could build

00:48:34.890 --> 00:48:38.290
and compare different,
say, regions of the world

00:48:38.290 --> 00:48:41.380
here with each other and
populate the information

00:48:41.380 --> 00:48:41.880
on there.

00:48:41.880 --> 00:48:44.970
And filter it by all
kinds of different tags

00:48:44.970 --> 00:48:47.040
like geographic
regions or topics,

00:48:47.040 --> 00:48:49.880
and be able to see what was
going on in the Greek world

00:48:49.880 --> 00:48:51.710
while such and such
was going on in China.

00:48:51.710 --> 00:48:55.250
And I only want to know
about rulers and divination.

00:48:55.250 --> 00:48:58.220
I don't care about
whatever food, you know.

00:48:58.220 --> 00:49:00.070
You want to be able to
filter your timeline

00:49:00.070 --> 00:49:01.130
in real time like that.

00:49:01.130 --> 00:49:05.020
Turns out that could be done
in a crowdsourced kind of way

00:49:05.020 --> 00:49:08.820
if there was a standard for
time tagging information.

00:49:08.820 --> 00:49:11.490
And that's a technical
challenge, and to some extent

00:49:11.490 --> 00:49:13.540
a sociopolitical
challenge, that again I

00:49:13.540 --> 00:49:15.040
can talk about if
you want to ask me

00:49:15.040 --> 00:49:16.160
about it in the questions.

00:49:16.160 --> 00:49:17.860
But the good news is
that, as far as we know,

00:49:17.860 --> 00:49:20.485
the Sloan Foundation is going to
fund this project, which we're

00:49:20.485 --> 00:49:23.180
doing in collaboration with
most of the organizations

00:49:23.180 --> 00:49:26.050
you see here-- the New York
Times, The New York Public

00:49:26.050 --> 00:49:30.900
Library, Microsoft,
and MIT Press.

00:49:30.900 --> 00:49:33.970
So the people, I've mentioned
most but not all of them who

00:49:33.970 --> 00:49:38.090
are participated so far beyond
Harvard are listed here.

00:49:38.090 --> 00:49:40.650
Here's Howard and Curtis, who
I mentioned at the beginning.

00:49:40.650 --> 00:49:44.640
And this is Keith Moore, the
archivist at the Royal Society.

00:49:44.640 --> 00:49:48.530
And then the people who
deserve the most credit here

00:49:48.530 --> 00:49:50.350
are the people from HarvardX.

00:49:50.350 --> 00:49:53.070
And maybe if you just
at least raise your hand

00:49:53.070 --> 00:49:55.430
gently if you're from HarvardX.

00:49:55.430 --> 00:49:56.780
OK.

00:49:56.780 --> 00:50:00.430
That's the crew right there--
Drew and Colin and Jared--

00:50:00.430 --> 00:50:03.690
who have made most of the
material that you see happen.

00:50:03.690 --> 00:50:07.240
And so I really want to
thank them tremendously--

00:50:07.240 --> 00:50:10.550
and you'll be able to meet
them at the reception--

00:50:10.550 --> 00:50:14.290
because they work
very, very, very hard.

00:50:14.290 --> 00:50:16.930
And I just would like
to wish you the best

00:50:16.930 --> 00:50:19.090
from the sheep of destiny here.

00:50:19.090 --> 00:50:21.310
This is a real coaster
I have in my office,

00:50:21.310 --> 00:50:23.580
if you'd like to come visit it.

00:50:23.580 --> 00:50:25.950
And if you'd like to ask
where our logo came from,

00:50:25.950 --> 00:50:27.780
I'll be happy to leave
that up and explain.

00:50:27.780 --> 00:50:29.820
Thank you very much.
