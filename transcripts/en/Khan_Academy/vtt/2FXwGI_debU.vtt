00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:02.100
- [Instructor] First-year
students at a certain

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.150
large university are
required to live on campus

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:09.140
in one of the 24
available residence halls.

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:10.780
After their first year,

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:13.980
students have the option
to live away from campus,

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.774
but many choose to continue
living in the residence halls.

00:00:17.774 --> 00:00:22.080
Estella oversees 12 of
these residence halls.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.350
Her department surveyed a
large simple random sample

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:30.550
of first-year students who live
in those 12 residence halls

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:34.670
about their overall
satisfaction with campus living.

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.120
Estella can safely generalize the results

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.970
of the survey to which population?

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:43.833
So pause this video, and see
if you could figure it out.

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.050
All right, so let's do this together.

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.220
So Estella has done,

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.160
it's a large simple random sample

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.670
of first-year students.

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:57.940
So let's see,

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.490
choice A is only those
students who were surveyed.

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:04.620
Well, no, this was a simple random sample,

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.030
and it was a large sample, so
it's meant to be indicative

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:08.820
of all first-year students.

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.400
You can generalize more
than just making statements

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.170
about just the students who were surveyed.

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:15.830
All first-year students,

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.793
but only those who live in
these 12 residence halls.

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.930
Yeah, I think this one looks fair

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.000
because you can't generalize to people

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.670
who don't live in those residence halls.

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.300
Maybe Estella oversees the
12 best residence halls

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:31.990
or the 12 worst residence halls,

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.370
and so you wouldn't get,
if that were the case,

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:38.190
you would not be able to
generalize beyond that.

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.270
Or these might be the 12
that are closest to campus

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.230
or the 12 that are furthest from campus.

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:44.470
So you can only generalize to people

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:47.230
who live in those residence halls.

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:49.110
All students, first-year and not,

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.570
but only those who live in
these 12 residence halls.

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:53.910
Well, the issue here is,

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:56.500
is that a second-year student
or a third-year student

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.530
might just have a different perspective,

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.720
even if they live in those,
in that same building

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.120
and we did a large random
sample of first-year students.

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:06.690
We didn't do a large random
sample of all people in that,

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.100
in that, those 12 residence
halls, so rule that out.

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.000
All first-year students
at the entire university,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.670
but not students beyond their first year.

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.020
Well, this wouldn't make sense

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:18.740
because there would be first-year students

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:21.050
who would be outside of
those residence halls.

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.900
And as I already mentioned,
the ones that Estella manages

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.470
might not be indicative of where

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.483
all of the first-year students
in this university live.
