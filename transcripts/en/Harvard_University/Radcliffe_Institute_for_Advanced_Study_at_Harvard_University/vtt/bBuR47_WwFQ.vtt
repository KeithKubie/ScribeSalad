[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.962 line:90%
Hello, everybody.

00:00:22.962 --> 00:00:24.420 line:84%
Welcome to the
Radcliffe Institute.

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:25.420 line:90%
I'm Liz Cohen.

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:27.090 line:84%
I'm the Dean of the
Radcliffe Institute

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.250 line:90%
and I'm delighted you're here.

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.009 line:84%
We're in for a very
exciting conversation

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.680 line:84%
today between feminist, artist,
activist, and educator, Judy

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.550 line:84%
Chicago, and historian,
Jane Gerhard,

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.550 line:84%
which will be moderated by
Nancy Cott, the Pforzheimer

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.310 line:84%
Foundation Director of
the Schlesinger Library

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:49.860 line:84%
and the Jonathan Trumbull
Professor of American History

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.220 line:90%
here at Harvard.

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:53.640 line:84%
I want to express my
thanks to Nancy Cott,

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.920 line:84%
as well as to Marilyn
Dunn, who is the Executive

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.680 line:84%
Director of the library
who has really spearheaded

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.420 line:84%
this tribute to Judy Chicago,
also to Exhibition Coordinator

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.700 line:84%
Bruce Williams, and
to the entire library

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.020 line:84%
staff for planning both the
exhibition and this program

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.130 line:84%
today to celebrate one of
our most precious manuscript

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.100 line:84%
collections, the "Papers
of Judy Chicago."

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.750 line:84%
These papers not only shed
light on Judy Chicago's

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.620 line:84%
well-known and ambitious
Dinner Party now

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:28.710 line:84%
on permanent display
in the Brooklyn Museum,

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.280 line:84%
but they reveal much more
about her development

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.620 line:84%
as a visual and a
performance artist,

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:38.480 line:84%
about her collaborations with
other artists and activists,

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.310 line:84%
and about her feminist
approach to teaching

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.080 line:84%
aimed at helping women fully
express their creativity.

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.870 line:84%
Before we hear
from Judy and Jane,

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:52.710 line:84%
we're going to begin in an
unusual but very appropriate

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:58.080 line:84%
way given today's guest with
a performance piece directed

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.200 line:84%
by Harvard College
junior Lelaina Vogel.

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.700 line:84%
Lelaina will be joined on
stage by junior Rachel Gibeon

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.449 line:84%
and sophomore's [? Alana ?]
Bach, Alice Berensen,

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:14.340 line:84%
and Danielle [? Lasard. ?]
Lelaina's piece is inspired

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.720 line:84%
by the teaching techniques
Judy devised when she started

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.320 line:84%
the very first feminist art
program in the United States

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.410 line:90%
at Fresno State in 1970.

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:26.880 line:84%
And then she
developed it further

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:32.040 line:84%
when she moved to the California
Institute of the Arts in 1972.

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.610 line:84%
There, she began collaborating
with fellow artist and faculty

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.900 line:84%
member Miriam Shapiro, which
led to the creation of Woman

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.610 line:84%
House, a feminist exhibition
and performance space fashioned

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.740 line:90%
from an abandoned mansion.

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:49.140 line:84%
Both Judy and her
students exhibited

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.720 line:84%
several important
pieces there that helped

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.270 line:90%
define feminist art.

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.150 line:84%
So it's fitting today
that our program

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.820 line:84%
will start with a
performance conceived

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:04.380 line:84%
by an undergraduate student at
Harvard who has been inspired

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:08.370 line:84%
by the way Judy Chicago's
teaching encourages

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.410 line:90%
women's creativity.

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:14.670 line:84%
Lelaina's piece titled
Performing the Archive

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.470 line:84%
is meant to connect
the library's

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.310 line:84%
exhibit with the conversation
we will soon witness.

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.300 line:84%
I'm also delighted that
Lelaina's performance piece

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:28.170 line:84%
will launch our program today,
because it embodies much

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.710 line:84%
of what we are trying to
accomplish here at Radcliffe,

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:35.340 line:84%
integrating the arts with
other kinds of knowledge,

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.090 line:84%
and seeking ways of involving
students in our Institute

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.190 line:90%
for Advanced Study.

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:44.040 line:84%
One of the ways that dozens
of Harvard College students

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.740 line:84%
participate in the
life of the Institute

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:51.330 line:84%
is to work closely with many
of the Institute's Annual 50

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:55.440 line:84%
Fellows on their scholarly
and creative projects as what

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.530 line:84%
we call Radcliffe
Research Partners.

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:02.010 line:84%
This in fact, is how the Lelaina
found her way to the Institute

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:05.490 line:84%
last year when she became an
actor in artist and fellow

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:07.890 line:84%
David Levine's
performance piece which

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:10.440 line:90%
was called Character Analysis.

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.100 line:84%
Through that project, Lelaina
met library staff member Bruce

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.700 line:84%
Williams who coordinates
exhibitions at the library.

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:21.209 line:84%
And when Bruce hatched the idea
of commissioning a performance

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:26.040 line:84%
piece based on Judy's papers
to accompany the exhibition,

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:29.250 line:84%
he immediately
thought of Lelaina.

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:33.720 line:84%
So now we are in for a very
special treat and a unique way

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:38.250 line:84%
to pay tribute to Judy Chicago's
lasting influence on the arts

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:42.900 line:84%
as we observe how her approach
to fostering women's creativity

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:47.880 line:84%
is being interpreted by the next
generation of women artists.

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:51.510 line:84%
So without further ado, I am
delighted to present to you

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:54.980 line:84%
the debut of
Performing the Archive.

00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:58.930 line:90%
Thank you all.

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:01.660 line:84%
That was a great
beginning for what

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:08.770 line:84%
I hope is going to be a very
exciting and unique afternoon.

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:12.650 line:84%
We have here, as
you know, we have

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:15.790 line:84%
Judy Chicago on the year
of her 75th birthday

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:20.170 line:84%
which we are celebrating
and very happy to spotlight,

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:25.270 line:84%
and her most recent
historian Jane Gerhard.

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:28.660 line:84%
Judy Chicago is somebody
I'm delighted to honor.

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:32.350 line:84%
She is one of the
most important,

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:35.770 line:84%
innovative, and productive
American artists

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:37.570 line:90%
of her generation.

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:42.460 line:84%
She is one of the best
known living artists,

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:45.790 line:84%
but she has never ceased
to be controversial.

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:50.590 line:84%
And in getting to today, she
has never found her path easy

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:55.000 line:84%
because she is an
iconoclast and path breaker.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.990 line:84%
By 1970, she made it very
clear that she intended

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:04.240 line:84%
to create art arising from
a woman's subjectivity,

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:07.990 line:84%
to create art from
women's experiences,

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:11.230 line:84%
and to represent the hidden
parts of women's bodies

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:17.140 line:84%
that Western art had avoided
and evaded even while it made,

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:21.160 line:84%
as she wrote, I quote her, "the
female body, the repository

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:24.340 line:90%
of so many emotions."

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:27.880 line:84%
Representations of women
had been omnipresent

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:32.260 line:84%
in Western art, but Judy
Chicago and other voices

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:36.730 line:84%
for women's liberation at the
time insisted on the limits

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:41.320 line:84%
on the objectification
in those representations.

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:43.480 line:84%
Along with others
of her generation,

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:47.110 line:84%
Judy Chicago insisted
upon intellectual and

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:51.340 line:84%
epistemological
transformation to show women

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:54.640 line:90%
as feeling subjects.

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:59.620 line:84%
Though the results shocked
viewers, horrified many,

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:03.010 line:84%
in fact, she had
a reparative aim

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:05.050 line:90%
along with a disruptive one.

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:08.140 line:84%
She aimed to repair,
and I quote her,

00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:11.890 line:84%
"the damage done to
our perceptual powers

00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:17.470 line:84%
by the absence of images
of female reality."

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:19.510 line:84%
Now, when I think
of Judy Chicago,

00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:25.270 line:84%
I think of several
elements, clarity of vision,

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:29.770 line:84%
imagination, conviction,
and especially

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:32.130 line:90%
extraordinary courage.

00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:33.990 line:84%
And I want to give
a few examples

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:38.010 line:84%
of the courageous things she did
in the beginning of her career

00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:41.070 line:84%
when it was hardest,
the installation

00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:46.500 line:84%
called the menstruation bathroom
in Women House in Los Angeles.

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:50.160 line:84%
This was a revolutionary
instance of her gutsiness.

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:53.700 line:84%
As was the preceding
photo lithograph

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:57.690 line:84%
called Red Flag which
photo lithograph

00:07:57.690 --> 00:08:01.380 line:84%
showed a woman's hand
pulling a bloody tampon out

00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:03.180 line:90%
of her vagina.

00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:07.440 line:84%
I think I'm on safe ground
in saying that no one before

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:11.940 line:84%
had even considered making
a bloody tampon a subject

00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:13.680 line:90%
for art.

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:17.160 line:84%
Then there was the justly
famous Dinner Party,

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:20.700 line:84%
which is now in a magnificent
installation in the Brooklyn

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:24.660 line:84%
Museum at the Elizabeth Sackler
Center for Feminist Art,

00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:27.840 line:84%
but that happened
only seven years ago.

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:30.630 line:84%
And for many years,
official museums

00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:32.760 line:90%
wouldn't show the Dinner Party.

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:36.840 line:84%
It gathered its huge notoriety
and its huge audiences

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:40.049 line:84%
from showings in venues
such as the Boston

00:08:40.049 --> 00:08:46.860 line:84%
Cyclorama in the south end where
I remember seeing it in 1980.

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:49.650 line:84%
And a brochure from
that time, a brochure

00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:53.730 line:84%
you can see in the exhibit,
includes a quotation from Judy

00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:56.620 line:84%
that perfectly
illustrates how her work--

00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:59.490 line:84%
certainly her work in
that installation--

00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:03.795 line:84%
dovetails perfectly with the
mission of the Schlesinger

00:09:03.795 --> 00:09:04.295 line:90%
Library.

00:09:04.295 --> 00:09:08.940 line:84%
And I quote her, "We can know
ourselves and our capacities

00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:11.970 line:84%
by seeing that other
women have been strong.

00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:14.910 line:84%
To reclaim our past
and insist that it

00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:17.610 line:84%
become a part of
human history is

00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:21.630 line:90%
the task that lies before us."

00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:23.880 line:84%
Then following the
Dinner Party, Judy

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:26.580 line:84%
inaugurated The Birth
Project to remedy

00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:32.130 line:84%
what she saw as an iconagraphic
void in Western art,

00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:36.570 line:84%
that there were hardly any
representations of birth,

00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:40.011 line:84%
at least from a
female point of view.

00:09:40.011 --> 00:09:44.520 line:84%
Now, in these three things
that I have mentioned,

00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:48.480 line:84%
I think her work might
be denominated, if you'll

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:52.940 line:90%
allow me, honoring the cunt.

00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:57.810 line:84%
Judy made viewers stare
straight on at the female vulva,

00:09:57.810 --> 00:10:00.390 line:84%
the womb, the
clitoris, the vagina

00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:05.880 line:84%
in a politics of recognition
about as iconoclast

00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:08.010 line:90%
as one could be.

00:10:08.010 --> 00:10:11.640 line:84%
Yet at the same
time, in the 1980s,

00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:14.640 line:84%
she began to work on
representing the male body

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:18.640 line:84%
and emotions in her
project called Power Play.

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:23.460 line:84%
And in the next decade, she
moved to her Holocaust Project.

00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:29.390 line:84%
Was the Holocaust too
extreme to display in art?

00:10:29.390 --> 00:10:32.430 line:84%
Well, to Judy Chicago,
no human experience,

00:10:32.430 --> 00:10:37.820 line:84%
whether it was generative or
destructive was too extreme.

00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:40.790 line:84%
Tapestry became the
medium for that project

00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:43.010 line:84%
because, as she
noted, and I quote,

00:10:43.010 --> 00:10:48.470 line:84%
"The Holocaust grew
out of the very fabric

00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:51.800 line:90%
of Western civilization."

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:54.990 line:84%
By that time, tapestry
was no stranger to her.

00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:57.770 line:84%
The diversity of types
of projects she has done

00:10:57.770 --> 00:11:01.610 line:84%
and of materials she has used
is another astonishing thing

00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:03.350 line:90%
about her oeuvre--

00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:05.900 line:84%
painting, performance--
as we saw here--

00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:09.240 line:84%
photography, embroidery,
weaving, tapestry,

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:14.300 line:84%
ceramics, using wood, metal,
porcelain, ivory, oil,

00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:17.810 line:84%
acrylic, silk, and in
some of her early work

00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:21.620 line:90%
dry ice and fireworks.

00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:24.440 line:84%
I wonder how many artists
have become or tried

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:29.660 line:84%
to become licensed
pyrotechnicians as Judy did?

00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:33.830 line:84%
Today, we're going to hear about
another genre of her creativity

00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:37.610 line:84%
and productivity
in art education.

00:11:37.610 --> 00:11:40.940 line:84%
She began offering what must be
called feminist art education

00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:45.620 line:84%
as early as 1969 as Liz Cohen
mentioned, and has continued

00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:49.520 line:84%
to do so in one form or
another until the present day.

00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:52.340 line:84%
Though for most of
the past 40 years,

00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:55.100 line:84%
not within academic
institutions,

00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:57.500 line:84%
but rather in her
collaborative art

00:11:57.500 --> 00:12:01.310 line:84%
projects which always
drew in volunteers.

00:12:01.310 --> 00:12:03.800 line:84%
During the early
2000s, though, she

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:08.060 line:84%
taught six semester-long
stints in six

00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:12.080 line:84%
different academic
institutions, universities.

00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:14.540 line:84%
And that is the
background against which

00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:16.370 line:84%
we should place
her new book, which

00:12:16.370 --> 00:12:21.550 line:84%
is called Institutional Time;
a Critique of Studio Art

00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:23.060 line:90%
Education.

00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:26.930 line:84%
As someone who favors
paradoxical and double meaning

00:12:26.930 --> 00:12:31.370 line:84%
titles, I love this
title, Institutional Time.

00:12:31.370 --> 00:12:34.040 line:84%
To me, it conjures
up the Goffman notion

00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:39.890 line:84%
of the total institution, it
connotes "doing time" in jail.

00:12:39.890 --> 00:12:42.740 line:84%
Simultaneously, it
suggests that institutions

00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:45.740 line:84%
have their own regime
or schedule that

00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:51.530 line:84%
implicitly differs from human
scale time or task orientation.

00:12:51.530 --> 00:12:54.190 line:84%
And it also suggests
to me that Judy

00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:57.470 line:84%
thought it was about time
that she should take up

00:12:57.470 --> 00:13:00.620 line:84%
the burden of addressing
directly studio art

00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:04.580 line:84%
education, since her own
discomfort with and rebellion

00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:07.370 line:84%
against the status
quo in art started

00:13:07.370 --> 00:13:10.250 line:84%
during her own
education at UCLA where

00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:13.340 line:84%
she got a master's degree
in painting and sculpture

00:13:13.340 --> 00:13:15.080 line:90%
in the '60s.

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:18.960 line:84%
We have the special treat today
of a dialogue with both Judy

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:23.660 line:84%
Chicago and her most recent
historian Jane Gerhard.

00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:26.750 line:84%
Jane-- I'm going to call both
women by their first names,

00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:30.800 line:84%
something I would not normally
do and might normally regard

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:33.530 line:90%
as somewhat disrespectful--

00:13:33.530 --> 00:13:37.700 line:84%
but it's hard to address Judy
Chicago as anything but Judy.

00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:40.760 line:84%
So I have to do
the same with Jane.

00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:45.590 line:84%
Jane's first book also has
a wonderfully double meaning

00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:48.500 line:90%
title, Desiring Revolution.

00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:52.130 line:84%
And it was what made her known
as a historian of 20th century

00:13:52.130 --> 00:13:52.970 line:90%
feminism.

00:13:52.970 --> 00:13:57.950 line:84%
It examines the sexual
thought of 1970s feminists.

00:13:57.950 --> 00:14:01.640 line:84%
And it traces why and how the
women's movement of the 1960s

00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:05.150 line:84%
and '70s took up the
issue of sexual liberation

00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:06.790 line:90%
for themselves.

00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:09.980 line:84%
Now, she has just published
a new book called The Dinner

00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:14.510 line:84%
Party; Judy Chicago and the
Power of Popular Feminism,

00:14:14.510 --> 00:14:17.420 line:84%
which is a cultural
history of the phenomenon

00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:20.230 line:90%
that Judy's work inspired.

00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:23.810 line:84%
And Jane argues that Judy's
work not only participated in,

00:14:23.810 --> 00:14:30.140 line:84%
but shaped larger debates about
feminism in the 1980s and '90s,

00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:33.770 line:84%
the so-called
post-feminist years.

00:14:33.770 --> 00:14:36.890 line:84%
And further, she thinks that
looking at the reception

00:14:36.890 --> 00:14:40.040 line:84%
and influence of Judy's
work can indicate

00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:43.640 line:84%
that feminism was a broader
phenomenon than historians

00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:45.260 line:90%
have usually claimed.

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:47.330 line:84%
That it has to be
seen to include

00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:50.180 line:84%
culture and consumption
and an investment

00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:52.610 line:90%
in personal transformation.

00:14:52.610 --> 00:14:56.660 line:84%
So we'll hear more about her
views and her own reactions

00:14:56.660 --> 00:14:59.000 line:90%
to Judy's work today.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.120 line:84%
Now let me invite them both
to come up on the stage.

00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:04.220 line:84%
And the way we are
going to proceed

00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:10.330 line:84%
is that I am going to ask each
of them several questions.

00:15:10.330 --> 00:15:14.420 line:84%
But I want to tell you, the
audience, that these questions

00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:17.510 line:84%
are questions that came from
the other person I'm not

00:15:17.510 --> 00:15:18.170 line:90%
questioning.

00:15:18.170 --> 00:15:20.630 line:84%
In other words, the questions
I'm going to ask Judy

00:15:20.630 --> 00:15:23.240 line:90%
came from Jane, and vice versa.

00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:27.080 line:84%
And after each of them answers
the questions I will raise,

00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:29.840 line:84%
then there will be
some time for them

00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:32.960 line:84%
to perhaps dialogue a
little between themselves

00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:36.140 line:84%
if they would like to,
and we'll then open it up

00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:38.940 line:90%
to you, the audience.

00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:41.120 line:90%
So let's begin.

00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:44.780 line:84%
First, I'm going to
question Jane Gerhard

00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:47.300 line:84%
and ask her the obvious
question, how did you

00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:50.150 line:90%
come to write The Dinner Party?

00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:52.490 line:84%
I was interested
in finding some way

00:15:52.490 --> 00:15:57.470 line:84%
to think about '70s feminism
outside of a social movement

00:15:57.470 --> 00:15:58.420 line:90%
framework.

00:15:58.420 --> 00:16:01.540 line:84%
You know, how to think
about the impact of feminism

00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:05.770 line:84%
for people who weren't in
political organizations.

00:16:05.770 --> 00:16:08.600 line:84%
And The Dinner Party was
a perfect object for that,

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:11.390 line:90%
because you could see--

00:16:11.390 --> 00:16:17.560 line:84%
you could see it move forward
in time across various decades

00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:20.250 line:90%
with its feminist DNA intact.

00:16:20.250 --> 00:16:22.190 line:84%
And you could trace
the reactions to it.

00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:25.070 line:84%
So it became like this
perfect object to move--

00:16:25.070 --> 00:16:29.330 line:84%
to sort of chart the changes
in feminist thinking,

00:16:29.330 --> 00:16:33.150 line:84%
the reception of the ideas
of feminism over time,

00:16:33.150 --> 00:16:35.363 line:84%
instead of thinking of
feminism as a static,

00:16:35.363 --> 00:16:37.490 line:90%
you know, a static set of ideas.

00:16:37.490 --> 00:16:39.530 line:84%
I mean, the power of
feminism has always

00:16:39.530 --> 00:16:41.750 line:84%
been that it touches
people's lives,

00:16:41.750 --> 00:16:45.470 line:84%
as well as changes laws
or changes institutions.

00:16:45.470 --> 00:16:50.150 line:84%
And I wanted some kind of way
in to that process, something

00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:54.700 line:84%
that was rigorous, like I
could do an archival study of,

00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:58.670 line:84%
but that I could see how
people changed in encountering

00:16:58.670 --> 00:17:00.560 line:90%
the ideas of feminism.

00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:03.800 line:84%
And Judy's archive
is so interesting

00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:07.550 line:84%
because there are letters from
viewers, there are letters

00:17:07.550 --> 00:17:09.740 line:84%
from, or documents
written by people

00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:11.480 line:90%
who worked on the project.

00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:18.079 line:84%
So there was a lot of more
ordinary voices in the archive

00:17:18.079 --> 00:17:20.060 line:90%
than you would find in other--

00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:21.200 line:90%
for other objects.

00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:23.589 line:84%
You know, it was kind of a
gold mine on that front that

00:17:23.589 --> 00:17:27.890 line:84%
could really get at how people
saw the ideas that Judy was

00:17:27.890 --> 00:17:29.980 line:90%
laying out through the arts.

00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:35.570 line:84%
And so that made it a very
exciting kind of test object,

00:17:35.570 --> 00:17:39.170 line:84%
an object to see how ideas of
feminism have moved forward.

00:17:39.170 --> 00:17:42.290 line:84%
I got started on the project
after Boot Camp in Women's

00:17:42.290 --> 00:17:47.000 line:84%
History here in this building
that you had run in 2006,

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.100 line:90%
I believe.

00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:50.390 line:84%
And I was imagining
that I was going to do

00:17:50.390 --> 00:17:52.320 line:90%
a chapter on The Dinner Party.

00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:54.200 line:84%
And then I went
over to the archives

00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:58.025 line:84%
and saw just the extent of
them and my mind was blown.

00:17:58.025 --> 00:17:59.270 line:90%
And I was like, oh, my god.

00:17:59.270 --> 00:18:01.070 line:84%
This is really
where I need to sit.

00:18:01.070 --> 00:18:03.470 line:84%
This is really where
there's so much,

00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:05.930 line:84%
there's so many stories here
that aren't in our records.

00:18:05.930 --> 00:18:09.280 line:84%
And there's a great
opportunity to really get

00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:13.370 line:84%
to think about material
culture in an interesting way.

00:18:13.370 --> 00:18:17.360 line:84%
Can you say a little bit more
about differences in reaction

00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:23.150 line:84%
or versions of feminist reaction
after, say, the late '80s

00:18:23.150 --> 00:18:28.130 line:84%
and into the '90s as compared to
what the initial reactions were

00:18:28.130 --> 00:18:29.660 line:90%
in the '70s?

00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:31.610 line:90%
Yeah.

00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:34.580 line:84%
Clearly had
controversies going on

00:18:34.580 --> 00:18:37.190 line:90%
attached to it still in 1990.

00:18:37.190 --> 00:18:40.070 line:84%
But my argument in
the book is really

00:18:40.070 --> 00:18:45.560 line:84%
that, as we got
farther away from 1979,

00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:49.630 line:84%
1980, some of the controversy
begins to die down.

00:18:49.630 --> 00:18:53.090 line:84%
So there's sort of a
new audience by 1990.

00:18:53.090 --> 00:18:55.640 line:84%
I think its status as history,
as we got farther away

00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:59.450 line:84%
from the '70s Feminist
Movement ended up

00:18:59.450 --> 00:19:03.590 line:84%
sort of making it more possible
to see it on its own terms

00:19:03.590 --> 00:19:05.630 line:90%
and being less controversial.

00:19:05.630 --> 00:19:07.610 line:84%
It was no longer
the battleground

00:19:07.610 --> 00:19:11.420 line:84%
for a certain high-pitched
feminist battle going

00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:13.910 line:84%
on about how to
represent feminism,

00:19:13.910 --> 00:19:16.490 line:84%
you know, what
kind of ambassador

00:19:16.490 --> 00:19:18.590 line:84%
should this art be
for the movements?

00:19:18.590 --> 00:19:20.150 line:84%
You know, the
movement had really

00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:23.360 line:84%
dissipated in a lot
of important ways.

00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:27.140 line:84%
It didn't end, but the social
movement piece of it had

00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:30.320 line:84%
definitely died
down by mid-'80s.

00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:32.780 line:84%
And so I think it became
possible to view it

00:19:32.780 --> 00:19:34.070 line:90%
in a new light.

00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:37.850 line:84%
And view it as a representative
of a certain moment

00:19:37.850 --> 00:19:41.090 line:84%
in feminism, which I
think paved the ground

00:19:41.090 --> 00:19:47.820 line:84%
to let it become canonized as it
has in at the Brooklyn Museum.

00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:50.116 line:84%
What about, what was
your own response

00:19:50.116 --> 00:19:51.240 line:90%
to seeing The Dinner Party?

00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:55.990 line:84%
And had you seen it already
when you began work on the book?

00:19:55.990 --> 00:19:56.490 line:90%
No.

00:19:56.490 --> 00:19:59.340 line:84%
No, I had heard about it in
my Women's Studies classes

00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:03.420 line:84%
and found only the critique
of The Dinner Party

00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:06.990 line:90%
as being essentialist.

00:20:06.990 --> 00:20:10.690 line:84%
And you know, even in
my first book, that's

00:20:10.690 --> 00:20:13.300 line:84%
the kind of reading I offered,
that this was an example

00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:16.870 line:90%
of feminist essentialism.

00:20:16.870 --> 00:20:19.450 line:84%
So when I went and saw
it, when it finally opened

00:20:19.450 --> 00:20:21.675 line:90%
in Brooklyn in 2007--

00:20:21.675 --> 00:20:23.300 line:84%
you know, it had been
very hard to see.

00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:25.060 line:90%
I was a child in 1980.

00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:29.780 line:84%
I did not get to see it
in Boston or in Chicago

00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:32.230 line:84%
and there was no opportunity
for me to have seen it.

00:20:32.230 --> 00:20:35.290 line:84%
So when I finally did
get to see it in 2007,

00:20:35.290 --> 00:20:37.750 line:84%
I was really struck
by the force of it,

00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:40.580 line:84%
the kind of emotional
power that it held.

00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:44.680 line:90%
It was visually arresting.

00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:45.570 line:90%
By then I had--

00:20:45.570 --> 00:20:48.340 line:84%
I have a PhD in Women's
History so I really

00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:53.050 line:84%
appreciated the intellectual
underpinnings of the piece.

00:20:53.050 --> 00:20:56.630 line:84%
But I was caught off guard by
the emotional impact of it, the

00:20:56.630 --> 00:20:58.030 line:90%
seeing it all together.

00:20:58.030 --> 00:21:01.720 line:84%
And then that really
kind of stuck in my mind.

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:04.480 line:84%
So when I was looking
for a project,

00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:08.150 line:84%
that's why I initially thought,
a chapter on The Dinner Party.

00:21:08.150 --> 00:21:11.900 line:84%
It is a fabulous installation
that really shows off

00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:14.510 line:90%
the piece magnificently.

00:21:14.510 --> 00:21:19.340 line:84%
And in order to track the
changing views of the piece

00:21:19.340 --> 00:21:22.980 line:84%
and of feminism, did you also
do interviews with people?

00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:23.480 line:90%
Yes.

00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:26.090 line:84%
I predominantly
used the archive,

00:21:26.090 --> 00:21:29.930 line:84%
but I wanted to make sure I was
reading the archival evidence

00:21:29.930 --> 00:21:32.690 line:84%
correctly, so I
interviewed people--

00:21:32.690 --> 00:21:34.860 line:90%
I'd say about 15 people.

00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:37.160 line:90%
I interviewed Judy twice.

00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:39.620 line:84%
But that was well after I
had gotten very embedded

00:21:39.620 --> 00:21:42.740 line:84%
into the archive, that was a
year or so into the archive

00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:45.920 line:84%
before I wanted to check
in with other people who

00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:46.910 line:90%
had worked on it.

00:21:46.910 --> 00:21:50.300 line:84%
For example, when I found
a specific document,

00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:53.750 line:84%
it was about the decision to
open the studio to volunteers

00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:56.040 line:90%
in 1977.

00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:58.700 line:84%
And I hadn't heard anything
about how the mechanism worked

00:21:58.700 --> 00:22:00.779 line:90%
to get people into the studio.

00:22:00.779 --> 00:22:02.570 line:84%
And it seemed to me
that they were actually

00:22:02.570 --> 00:22:04.860 line:84%
opening the studio for
a number of reasons.

00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:08.750 line:84%
One was certainly to get
help to finish the piece.

00:22:08.750 --> 00:22:13.055 line:90%
But part of it was also to get--

00:22:13.055 --> 00:22:17.500 line:84%
to build audience
interest, to build--

00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:23.050 line:84%
to build-- sell a
certain kind of--

00:22:23.050 --> 00:22:25.640 line:84%
to offer a certain kind
of feminist experience

00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:28.340 line:90%
to other people in the area.

00:22:28.340 --> 00:22:31.550 line:84%
You know, you could
volunteer to come work

00:22:31.550 --> 00:22:38.090 line:84%
at the studio for a month,
three months, whatever.

00:22:38.090 --> 00:22:39.800 line:90%
So I didn't really know how to--

00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:41.550 line:84%
I really needed to
do research on that.

00:22:41.550 --> 00:22:43.924 line:84%
So that's when I started to
get in touch with more people

00:22:43.924 --> 00:22:47.150 line:84%
more regularly, just so I
made sure I really understood

00:22:47.150 --> 00:22:50.000 line:90%
what this document meant.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.400 line:90%
So it's predominantly archival.

00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:54.657 line:84%
But the people you contacted
were not simply viewers.

00:22:54.657 --> 00:22:56.240 line:84%
They were people who
had been involved

00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:57.198 line:90%
in created the project.

00:22:57.198 --> 00:22:59.180 line:84%
People who were
active in the project.

00:22:59.180 --> 00:23:02.840 line:84%
And did Judy, once you met
her and interviewed her,

00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:05.600 line:84%
influence the book
it all or play a part

00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:08.490 line:90%
in what you eventually wrote?

00:23:08.490 --> 00:23:11.550 line:84%
I have to say, I was pretty
clear about what was going on.

00:23:11.550 --> 00:23:13.380 line:84%
And Judy confirmed
things for me.

00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:18.120 line:84%
She didn't change the story,
she gave me more information.

00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:21.630 line:84%
She supplemented with a couple
of extra financial documents

00:23:21.630 --> 00:23:23.310 line:90%
that weren't in the archive yet.

00:23:23.310 --> 00:23:27.110 line:84%
But she didn't imprint the
story that I had already

00:23:27.110 --> 00:23:29.910 line:90%
gotten set in my mind.

00:23:29.910 --> 00:23:35.560 line:84%
She really just answered
my questions and let go.

00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:36.370 line:90%
Great, thank you.

00:23:36.370 --> 00:23:37.630 line:90%
Thank you so much, Jane.

00:23:37.630 --> 00:23:40.915 line:84%
Now, I'm going to move to
some questions for Judy.

00:23:44.150 --> 00:23:49.430 line:84%
Since the beginning, of course,
of your career, Judy, you--

00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:53.840 line:84%
or almost the very beginning,
you used the term feminist art.

00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:56.600 line:84%
I noticed that in
one of the documents

00:23:56.600 --> 00:24:02.520 line:84%
we have in the exhibit you
have on it, you write on it,

00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:05.190 line:84%
in addition to the
representations

00:24:05.190 --> 00:24:09.150 line:84%
and forms on it, you
say, "Feminist art

00:24:09.150 --> 00:24:14.900 line:84%
is all the stages of a woman
giving birth to herself."

00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:18.630 line:84%
But that was written
quite a while ago,

00:24:18.630 --> 00:24:24.030 line:84%
and I wondered how you
define feminist art now,

00:24:24.030 --> 00:24:29.680 line:84%
particularly since the book is
about feminist art education?

00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:33.420 line:84%
And so tell us
about how you define

00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:37.500 line:84%
both of those things, feminist
art and feminist art education.

00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:43.370 line:84%
I often say that in the '70s
we kind of cast the discourse

00:24:43.370 --> 00:24:48.410 line:84%
incorrectly, because we cast
it entirely around gender.

00:24:48.410 --> 00:24:54.150 line:84%
And actually, feminism
is more about values.

00:24:54.150 --> 00:24:57.600 line:84%
And you don't have to be
a woman to be a feminist.

00:24:57.600 --> 00:25:01.770 line:84%
One of the problems with having
cast the discourse entirely

00:25:01.770 --> 00:25:06.570 line:84%
around gender is
that we made friends

00:25:06.570 --> 00:25:09.030 line:84%
with people who
weren't our friends,

00:25:09.030 --> 00:25:13.080 line:84%
and made enemies of people who
could have been our friends.

00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:16.620 line:84%
For example, my husband, Donald
Woodman, the photographer,

00:25:16.620 --> 00:25:22.080 line:84%
he was at MIT in the '70s at the
height of the Women's Movement

00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:23.530 line:90%
here.

00:25:23.530 --> 00:25:27.540 line:84%
And when he was a returning
graduate at the University

00:25:27.540 --> 00:25:29.520 line:90%
of Houston--

00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:31.410 line:84%
I mean, he was a
pretty radical guy

00:25:31.410 --> 00:25:34.890 line:84%
and he had value is
very similar to my own.

00:25:34.890 --> 00:25:37.500 line:84%
When he was in the
University of Houston,

00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:41.130 line:84%
he was approached by a group
that wanted to bring The Dinner

00:25:41.130 --> 00:25:42.510 line:90%
Party to Houston--

00:25:42.510 --> 00:25:44.656 line:84%
because he's very
handy, and they

00:25:44.656 --> 00:25:49.470 line:84%
needed a preparetor, and a team
to install The Dinner Party.

00:25:49.470 --> 00:25:53.130 line:84%
And at some point he was
told he couldn't participate

00:25:53.130 --> 00:25:54.510 line:90%
because of his gender.

00:25:54.510 --> 00:25:57.130 line:84%
I always say, he had to marry
me to install The Dinner Party.

00:25:57.130 --> 00:26:03.960 line:84%
But anyway, so because
my definition was so

00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:08.880 line:84%
focused on gender in the '70s,
my definition of a feminist art

00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:11.340 line:90%
was similarly focused.

00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:17.760 line:84%
Now that I have expanded
my concept of feminism,

00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:20.940 line:84%
I've also expanded my
concept of feminist art.

00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:25.050 line:84%
And that is, my
concept of feminism

00:26:25.050 --> 00:26:28.800 line:84%
underwent the kind of
expansion that took place

00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:32.550 line:84%
as a result of the '80s
critique of the universalizing

00:26:32.550 --> 00:26:35.880 line:90%
of the term woman.

00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:39.240 line:84%
And then when Donald and
I worked on The Holocaust

00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:44.500 line:84%
Project, I really began
to see gender oppression

00:26:44.500 --> 00:26:47.860 line:84%
as part of a whole global
structure of injustice

00:26:47.860 --> 00:26:54.740 line:84%
and oppression
that, in my values,

00:26:54.740 --> 00:26:59.390 line:84%
would be overturned through
a feminist revolution.

00:26:59.390 --> 00:27:03.160 line:84%
And so what does that
mean about feminist art?

00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:08.480 line:84%
It means that feminist art
is grounded in a challenge

00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:12.740 line:84%
to the prevailing value
structure of our world.

00:27:12.740 --> 00:27:14.581 line:90%
And can men make feminist art?

00:27:14.581 --> 00:27:15.080 line:90%
Yes.

00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:18.080 line:84%
Actually, Catherine
Morris, the curator

00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:22.310 line:84%
at the Sackler Center at
the Brooklyn Museum kind of

00:27:22.310 --> 00:27:25.460 line:84%
answered that question
without raising it directly

00:27:25.460 --> 00:27:28.520 line:84%
by doing an exhibition
by a male artist who

00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:31.460 line:84%
was working on the subject
of Mary Wollstonecraft.

00:27:31.460 --> 00:27:34.400 line:84%
So, yes, men can
make feminist art.

00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:37.730 line:84%
In terms of feminist
art education, you know,

00:27:37.730 --> 00:27:40.910 line:84%
when I went back to
teaching in 1999,

00:27:40.910 --> 00:27:44.210 line:84%
one of the things I was
interested in discovering

00:27:44.210 --> 00:27:47.120 line:84%
was whether my pedagogical
principles could also

00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:49.400 line:90%
be applied to men.

00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:54.130 line:84%
And so that was
interesting for me,

00:27:54.130 --> 00:27:58.310 line:84%
and interesting when Donald
and I started team teaching.

00:27:58.310 --> 00:28:01.430 line:84%
And in fact, when I was at the
University of North Carolina,

00:28:01.430 --> 00:28:07.580 line:84%
Chapel Hill, which was the first
time I was teaching a really

00:28:07.580 --> 00:28:12.580 line:84%
mixed gender class, 50/50,
some of the male students

00:28:12.580 --> 00:28:15.710 line:84%
actually seemed to benefit
more than the female students

00:28:15.710 --> 00:28:20.810 line:84%
from my pedagogy, because some
of the women were resistant.

00:28:20.810 --> 00:28:23.570 line:84%
They were in thrall
to a different set

00:28:23.570 --> 00:28:26.780 line:84%
of values about art
that had been promoted,

00:28:26.780 --> 00:28:29.780 line:84%
that is promoted by the
male-centered art world.

00:28:29.780 --> 00:28:31.910 line:84%
And so that presented me
with a certain quandary

00:28:31.910 --> 00:28:35.930 line:84%
about how, since I'm so
committed to women's education,

00:28:35.930 --> 00:28:38.780 line:84%
how do I feel about
the idea that it would

00:28:38.780 --> 00:28:42.520 line:90%
be men who would benefit more?

00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:44.770 line:84%
I don't have the answer to
that, but it was definitely

00:28:44.770 --> 00:28:48.700 line:84%
a question that
was raised for me.

00:28:48.700 --> 00:28:51.670 line:84%
About your experiences
of teaching students,

00:28:51.670 --> 00:28:57.240 line:84%
you've done it in many different
ways for many decades now.

00:28:57.240 --> 00:29:01.290 line:84%
And are the students
you've taught--

00:29:01.290 --> 00:29:03.155 line:84%
obviously you just
mentioned now there

00:29:03.155 --> 00:29:04.860 line:90%
are men as well as women--

00:29:04.860 --> 00:29:07.360 line:84%
but in other ways, in
terms of their values,

00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:09.930 line:84%
their expectations,
do you see changes

00:29:09.930 --> 00:29:12.690 line:84%
that are worth
commenting on in terms

00:29:12.690 --> 00:29:15.270 line:90%
of the students' outlooks?

00:29:15.270 --> 00:29:18.030 line:84%
It was interesting,
because Jane was talking

00:29:18.030 --> 00:29:20.460 line:84%
about doing interviews--
because Institutional Time is

00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:24.030 line:84%
both a print book and it
will also be an e-book.

00:29:24.030 --> 00:29:26.600 line:84%
I did something I had never
done before, which was--

00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:29.340 line:84%
and I did it also for the
new Dinner Party book--

00:29:29.340 --> 00:29:31.380 line:84%
I did interviews
for the e-books.

00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:36.900 line:84%
And I interviewed some of the
my former students and some--

00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:40.020 line:84%
like for example,
I interviewed--

00:29:40.020 --> 00:29:41.700 line:84%
One of the things
that was really great

00:29:41.700 --> 00:29:43.620 line:84%
about the interviews
is that I didn't really

00:29:43.620 --> 00:29:47.910 line:84%
tell them that much about what
I had dealt with in the book.

00:29:47.910 --> 00:29:50.820 line:84%
And I'd be sitting
there interviewing them,

00:29:50.820 --> 00:29:53.850 line:84%
for example, Nancy Yodelman
who was one of the, quote,

00:29:53.850 --> 00:29:56.700 line:90%
"Fresno" girls, you know--

00:29:56.700 --> 00:29:59.110 line:84%
they all say, "oh, Judy,
we're all in our 50s or 60s."

00:29:59.110 --> 00:30:01.570 line:84%
And I'm like, "well, you'll
always be the girls to me."

00:30:01.570 --> 00:30:04.980 line:84%
But anyway, I was sitting
there interviewing her.

00:30:04.980 --> 00:30:08.760 line:84%
And one of my points in
the book is that university

00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:10.560 line:84%
studio art education
is inherently

00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:12.430 line:90%
biased against women.

00:30:12.430 --> 00:30:14.190 line:84%
So Nancy's telling
this story about when

00:30:14.190 --> 00:30:17.730 line:84%
she was at Fresno State
before she took my class

00:30:17.730 --> 00:30:19.680 line:90%
and how she makes sculpture.

00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:24.960 line:84%
She does, she casts dresses
in bronze and other materials.

00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:26.880 line:84%
But she said, I didn't
want to have anything

00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:28.980 line:84%
to do with the
sculpture department.

00:30:28.980 --> 00:30:30.020 line:90%
Why, I say?

00:30:30.020 --> 00:30:33.930 line:84%
She says, because I didn't
want to make a plaster cube.

00:30:33.930 --> 00:30:37.080 line:84%
So I'm talking in the
book about the fact

00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:38.900 line:84%
that there's this
assumption, like when--

00:30:38.900 --> 00:30:40.290 line:84%
you know, I don't if it
has changed that much

00:30:40.290 --> 00:30:42.206 line:84%
since when I was a
student-- but like everyone

00:30:42.206 --> 00:30:43.980 line:84%
is going to build
something with a 4 by 4.

00:30:43.980 --> 00:30:45.870 line:90%
I had no idea what a 4 by 4 was.

00:30:45.870 --> 00:30:47.730 line:90%
I never used a power saw.

00:30:47.730 --> 00:30:51.330 line:84%
I mean I didn't know how to
build anything with a 4 by 4.

00:30:51.330 --> 00:30:55.230 line:84%
And so here she is talking about
exactly the same thing, right?

00:30:55.230 --> 00:30:58.980 line:84%
Or in another
chapter I interviewed

00:30:58.980 --> 00:31:02.310 line:84%
a boy, very talented boy who
was in the project Donald

00:31:02.310 --> 00:31:06.330 line:84%
and I did at Western Kentucky
University in Bowling Green,

00:31:06.330 --> 00:31:09.200 line:84%
where we revisited the
subject of the home

00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:14.040 line:84%
30 years after Woman House with
both male and female students

00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:16.900 line:84%
in a project called
At Home in Kentucky.

00:31:16.900 --> 00:31:22.110 line:84%
And in the chapter called
Beyond the Diploma,

00:31:22.110 --> 00:31:26.550 line:84%
I talk about what young
artists, young graduates face

00:31:26.550 --> 00:31:28.800 line:84%
when they get out
of graduate school,

00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:37.160 line:84%
the kind of shock when they
begin to understand as, I quote

00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:42.060 line:84%
at the beginning of the
book, an MFA student who

00:31:42.060 --> 00:31:45.600 line:84%
wrote one of the few books on
university study art education.

00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:47.100 line:84%
It's quite shocking
how little there

00:31:47.100 --> 00:31:51.190 line:84%
is in contrast to how much
there is on K-12, for example.

00:31:51.190 --> 00:31:54.360 line:84%
Anyway, one book is a
book called Art Subjects;

00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:58.230 line:84%
Making Artists in the American
University by Howard Singerman.

00:31:58.230 --> 00:32:00.930 line:84%
And in there, he went to
one of the top art schools.

00:32:00.930 --> 00:32:05.310 line:84%
He either went to Cal Arts
or UCLA, he never said.

00:32:05.310 --> 00:32:09.000 line:84%
And he said, "Although I hold
a master of Fine Arts degree

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:12.120 line:84%
in sculpture, I do not
have the traditional skills

00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:13.350 line:90%
of the sculptor.

00:32:13.350 --> 00:32:17.250 line:84%
I cannot carve or cast
or weld or model in clay.

00:32:17.250 --> 00:32:17.850 line:90%
Why not?"

00:32:17.850 --> 00:32:21.030 line:84%
In other words, he may know how
to talk about being an artist,

00:32:21.030 --> 00:32:24.960 line:84%
but he cannot actually make
art because of the de-skilling

00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:26.940 line:90%
of studio art education.

00:32:26.940 --> 00:32:33.520 line:84%
So you know it was like this
boy who was in the Kentucky

00:32:33.520 --> 00:32:37.210 line:84%
program, when I was talking
about how difficult it

00:32:37.210 --> 00:32:39.430 line:90%
is for young artists.

00:32:39.430 --> 00:32:43.810 line:84%
You know, when I got out of
graduate school I was in LA,

00:32:43.810 --> 00:32:45.550 line:90%
it was very cheap to live.

00:32:45.550 --> 00:32:48.040 line:84%
My first studio I shared
with two other artists.

00:32:48.040 --> 00:32:50.110 line:84%
We had a 5,000
square foot studio.

00:32:50.110 --> 00:32:53.740 line:90%
We paid $75 a month together.

00:32:53.740 --> 00:32:55.210 line:90%
But that's completely changed.

00:32:55.210 --> 00:32:57.790 line:84%
These young people get
out with big debts,

00:32:57.790 --> 00:33:00.040 line:84%
they have no ability--
you know there's only

00:33:00.040 --> 00:33:02.530 line:84%
two systems for making
money as an artist,

00:33:02.530 --> 00:33:05.380 line:84%
either the gallery system
or the university system,

00:33:05.380 --> 00:33:08.420 line:84%
and most of them have
to get full-time jobs.

00:33:08.420 --> 00:33:10.990 line:84%
And so I was
interviewing Josh Edwards

00:33:10.990 --> 00:33:13.330 line:90%
who was a really gifted boy.

00:33:13.330 --> 00:33:18.790 line:84%
And he now runs the
whole exhibition program

00:33:18.790 --> 00:33:21.160 line:90%
for the new museum in New York.

00:33:21.160 --> 00:33:24.910 line:84%
And he said, I feel
so lucky that I

00:33:24.910 --> 00:33:28.750 line:84%
didn't have such a burning
desire to make my own art.

00:33:28.750 --> 00:33:32.170 line:84%
I'm perfectly happy
installing other people's art,

00:33:32.170 --> 00:33:35.590 line:84%
he said, because all my
friends are miserable.

00:33:35.590 --> 00:33:39.670 line:84%
They came out of school,
they're $100,000 in debt,

00:33:39.670 --> 00:33:41.770 line:84%
they have to get
a full-time job.

00:33:41.770 --> 00:33:43.900 line:90%
They have no time to make art.

00:33:43.900 --> 00:33:46.130 line:90%
They're just miserable.

00:33:46.130 --> 00:33:48.190 line:84%
And I'm like, oh,
where did I say

00:33:48.190 --> 00:33:50.680 line:84%
that in the book
about this poor kid?

00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:54.550 line:84%
So it was really interesting
having the opportunity

00:33:54.550 --> 00:33:57.790 line:84%
to see enacted a
lot of the points

00:33:57.790 --> 00:33:59.990 line:90%
that I was making in the book.

00:33:59.990 --> 00:34:04.360 line:84%
Well, on that, I know
I've heard other-wheres

00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:09.730 line:84%
that the only way a young artist
can make it at all these days

00:34:09.730 --> 00:34:12.010 line:90%
is by getting an MFA.

00:34:12.010 --> 00:34:14.739 line:84%
Whereas, that wasn't
always the case.

00:34:14.739 --> 00:34:17.110 line:84%
That is, that they will never
get into the gallery scene

00:34:17.110 --> 00:34:19.699 line:84%
if they don't make the
connections of getting an MFA.

00:34:19.699 --> 00:34:20.199 line:90%
An MFA?

00:34:20.199 --> 00:34:22.500 line:84%
You don't need an MFA
to get into a gallery.

00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:23.139 line:90%
In fact--

00:34:23.139 --> 00:34:24.780 line:90%
You don't think that's accurate?

00:34:24.780 --> 00:34:26.770 line:84%
Because where I
read this critique,

00:34:26.770 --> 00:34:29.199 line:84%
the person was lamenting
that there was just

00:34:29.199 --> 00:34:31.730 line:84%
a complete channeling
in that direction.

00:34:31.730 --> 00:34:33.790 line:84%
And otherwise, if
you were just really

00:34:33.790 --> 00:34:35.800 line:84%
talented and struck
out on your own--

00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:43.179 line:84%
If you are in the MFA program at
Yale or at Cal Arts or at UCLA

00:34:43.179 --> 00:34:46.750 line:84%
or any of the top schools in
the country, the Chicago Art

00:34:46.750 --> 00:34:50.800 line:90%
Institute, you are in a network.

00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:51.310 line:90%
Yeah.

00:34:51.310 --> 00:34:54.639 line:84%
And it is the network
that helps you.

00:34:54.639 --> 00:34:56.080 line:90%
It is not the MFA.

00:34:56.080 --> 00:34:57.790 line:84%
Oh, well that's
exactly what I meant.

00:34:57.790 --> 00:34:59.820 line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:34:59.820 --> 00:35:03.280 line:84%
If you get an MFA,
they don't have

00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:06.190 line:84%
an MFA program at Western
Kentucky, but if they did

00:35:06.190 --> 00:35:07.371 line:90%
it would not help you.

00:35:07.371 --> 00:35:07.870 line:90%
Yeah.

00:35:07.870 --> 00:35:12.280 line:84%
And in fact-- not
getting in the network.

00:35:12.280 --> 00:35:16.960 line:84%
And in fact, a lot
of artists do not

00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:18.730 line:90%
say they have teaching jobs.

00:35:18.730 --> 00:35:24.010 line:84%
It actually-- I mean I quote
from a lot of-- from literature

00:35:24.010 --> 00:35:28.270 line:84%
that says, it kind of undermines
your cred as an artist

00:35:28.270 --> 00:35:29.660 line:90%
if you're teaching.

00:35:29.660 --> 00:35:30.160 line:90%
OK?

00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:35.220 line:84%
So there's a real
double standard.

00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:36.507 line:90%
Because a lot of--

00:35:36.507 --> 00:35:38.340 line:84%
you know, you don't
have any health benefits

00:35:38.340 --> 00:35:40.020 line:90%
if you don't have a job.

00:35:40.020 --> 00:35:44.860 line:84%
And you know that's how I
lived for most of my life.

00:35:44.860 --> 00:35:48.730 line:84%
But it was easier when I
was younger, way easier.

00:35:48.730 --> 00:35:52.270 line:84%
And also the MFA programs
were not feeder schools

00:35:52.270 --> 00:35:54.411 line:90%
for the art industry.

00:35:54.411 --> 00:35:54.910 line:90%
Right.

00:35:54.910 --> 00:35:57.520 line:84%
I think that's the nature
of the critique I read.

00:35:57.520 --> 00:36:01.660 line:84%
And it was more about
these elite schools

00:36:01.660 --> 00:36:03.040 line:90%
that compose the network.

00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:05.815 line:84%
And the complaint was that
if you're not in that--

00:36:05.815 --> 00:36:07.190 line:84%
Oh, yeah, that's
absolutely true.

00:36:07.190 --> 00:36:11.300 line:84%
But you know, you have to
realize at any given moment,

00:36:11.300 --> 00:36:14.260 line:84%
there are 40,000
young artists looking

00:36:14.260 --> 00:36:19.810 line:84%
for galleries in New York,
and the same number in London.

00:36:19.810 --> 00:36:23.230 line:84%
There are 10,000 MFAs
who are graduated

00:36:23.230 --> 00:36:29.160 line:84%
every year around the world
into a tiny distribution system.

00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:30.060 line:90%
That many?

00:36:30.060 --> 00:36:30.560 line:90%
Yes.

00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:31.601 line:90%
That is really something.

00:36:31.601 --> 00:36:34.540 line:84%
And now, there's
a whole new thing,

00:36:34.540 --> 00:36:38.730 line:84%
which is the idea of introducing
the PhD program in studio

00:36:38.730 --> 00:36:42.970 line:84%
art, which is guaranteed to
give us even more academic art

00:36:42.970 --> 00:36:45.090 line:90%
than we already have.

00:36:45.090 --> 00:36:46.300 line:90%
Yeah.

00:36:46.300 --> 00:36:50.140 line:84%
Yeah, well, on that
matter, you, of course,

00:36:50.140 --> 00:36:54.750 line:84%
started by founding an
alternative institution, Woman

00:36:54.750 --> 00:36:55.290 line:90%
House.

00:36:55.290 --> 00:36:58.980 line:84%
No, well, Women House
was an art project.

00:36:58.980 --> 00:37:01.089 line:84%
The only alternative
institution I founded

00:37:01.089 --> 00:37:02.130 line:90%
was the Woman's Building.

00:37:02.130 --> 00:37:04.770 line:84%
The Woman's Building, right,
with Sheila de Bretteville.

00:37:04.770 --> 00:37:06.210 line:90%
Yeah.

00:37:06.210 --> 00:37:08.840 line:84%
But my question was not
about those early projects,

00:37:08.840 --> 00:37:11.910 line:84%
it was more the general
point that your book

00:37:11.910 --> 00:37:16.380 line:84%
deals with university education
in studio art programs.

00:37:16.380 --> 00:37:19.690 line:84%
It doesn't say, let's do a
different model altogether.

00:37:19.690 --> 00:37:25.500 line:84%
Let's have something outside
the existing academia.

00:37:25.500 --> 00:37:28.960 line:84%
Can you tell us more about
why you decided to do that,

00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:32.080 line:90%
to take that tactic?

00:37:32.080 --> 00:37:37.450 line:84%
Well, in the '70s when we
started creating alternatives,

00:37:37.450 --> 00:37:41.080 line:84%
all women shows, and the
Woman's Building, Woman House,

00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:45.460 line:84%
Woman Space, the Women's
Art Journal, I mean,

00:37:45.460 --> 00:37:50.650 line:84%
I don't think that I seriously
thought we were going to be

00:37:50.650 --> 00:37:56.830 line:84%
able to reconstruct the entire
institutional structure of--

00:37:56.830 --> 00:38:01.540 line:84%
build an alternative structure
that would be viable enough

00:38:01.540 --> 00:38:04.600 line:84%
to compete with the existing
institutional structures

00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:10.950 line:84%
around the world that evolved
over decades, decades,

00:38:10.950 --> 00:38:14.420 line:84%
centuries, generations,
centuries, right?

00:38:14.420 --> 00:38:17.750 line:84%
What we were trying to do
was develop a strategy that

00:38:17.750 --> 00:38:20.810 line:84%
would bring women
into visibility,

00:38:20.810 --> 00:38:26.210 line:84%
would challenge the restrictions
and the exclusion of women.

00:38:26.210 --> 00:38:32.660 line:84%
But now, I am sick to
death of women shows,

00:38:32.660 --> 00:38:36.320 line:84%
because even now-- because
if what we wanted to do

00:38:36.320 --> 00:38:39.530 line:84%
was change the percentages
in the institutions, yeah,

00:38:39.530 --> 00:38:41.780 line:90%
we changed at the margins.

00:38:41.780 --> 00:38:43.640 line:84%
I mean, there's
just definitely--

00:38:43.640 --> 00:38:45.787 line:84%
it would be ridiculous
not to acknowledge

00:38:45.787 --> 00:38:47.870 line:84%
that there's been a
considerable amount of change.

00:38:47.870 --> 00:38:51.920 line:84%
Young women and artists
of color can be themselves

00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:54.860 line:84%
in ways that was impossible
when I was young.

00:38:54.860 --> 00:38:58.160 line:84%
There are many more women
and artists of color showing.

00:38:58.160 --> 00:39:02.150 line:84%
But you have to look
inside the statistics,

00:39:02.150 --> 00:39:06.140 line:84%
because mostly they're showing
in regional galleries, smaller

00:39:06.140 --> 00:39:11.400 line:90%
galleries, university museums.

00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:14.630 line:84%
And we were just in Washington
and in The Washington Post

00:39:14.630 --> 00:39:18.590 line:84%
on Sunday there was a huge
article about women directors

00:39:18.590 --> 00:39:20.570 line:90%
in the Washington area.

00:39:20.570 --> 00:39:23.210 line:84%
Fortunately Johnnetta
Cole was one of them.

00:39:23.210 --> 00:39:26.330 line:84%
And Johnnetta Cole, who I
got a honorary doctorate with

00:39:26.330 --> 00:39:29.780 line:84%
at the same time as Smith, and
we fell madly in love with each

00:39:29.780 --> 00:39:32.720 line:84%
other-- me and my husband,
her and her husband--

00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:34.550 line:90%
she is so smart.

00:39:34.550 --> 00:39:39.050 line:84%
And she's like, yeah, but if
you look at all the museums

00:39:39.050 --> 00:39:41.330 line:84%
that have budgets
over $200 million,

00:39:41.330 --> 00:39:44.270 line:84%
there's hardly one
woman running them.

00:39:44.270 --> 00:39:47.690 line:84%
And there are only five
women museum directors

00:39:47.690 --> 00:39:49.700 line:90%
of color in the entire country.

00:39:49.700 --> 00:39:51.320 line:90%
I'm like go, Johnnetta.

00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:56.879 line:84%
Because the way in which
our history is controlled--

00:39:56.879 --> 00:39:58.670 line:84%
and that's what I was
always interested in.

00:39:58.670 --> 00:40:00.669 line:84%
I was always interested
in making a contribution

00:40:00.669 --> 00:40:04.010 line:84%
to art history and changing
history and art history.

00:40:04.010 --> 00:40:05.990 line:84%
The way art history
is controlled

00:40:05.990 --> 00:40:12.980 line:84%
through solo
publications, monographs,

00:40:12.980 --> 00:40:15.950 line:84%
permanent collections
in the major museums,

00:40:15.950 --> 00:40:18.050 line:90%
and major exhibitions.

00:40:18.050 --> 00:40:22.220 line:84%
So you know, this celebration
of my 75th birthday--

00:40:22.220 --> 00:40:25.520 line:84%
I'll take the last one
first-- is very interesting,

00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:28.790 line:84%
because it's
basically an end run

00:40:28.790 --> 00:40:30.680 line:90%
around institutional resistance.

00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:33.020 line:84%
Because there is not a
major museum in the world

00:40:33.020 --> 00:40:37.430 line:84%
that would accord enough
space for a real retrospective

00:40:37.430 --> 00:40:39.300 line:90%
of my work.

00:40:39.300 --> 00:40:42.630 line:84%
Like last summer, Jim
Turrell, who I came up with,

00:40:42.630 --> 00:40:46.410 line:84%
was given 92,000 square
feet of museum space

00:40:46.410 --> 00:40:51.270 line:84%
in three museums around
the country simultaneously.

00:40:51.270 --> 00:40:57.800 line:84%
Never would a woman artist in my
generation get that much space.

00:40:57.800 --> 00:40:58.600 line:90%
And I could use it.

00:40:58.600 --> 00:40:59.974 line:84%
You know how much
room my archive

00:40:59.974 --> 00:41:02.040 line:84%
takes up here at the
Schlesinger, right?

00:41:02.040 --> 00:41:03.850 line:90%
I mean that's just my papers.

00:41:03.850 --> 00:41:07.110 line:84%
That's just the spin-off
from my production, right?

00:41:07.110 --> 00:41:08.021 line:90%
Yeah.

00:41:08.021 --> 00:41:08.520 line:90%
OK.

00:41:08.520 --> 00:41:12.750 line:84%
So the second is
museum collections.

00:41:12.750 --> 00:41:14.580 line:84%
I'm not in the Tate
Modern, I'm not

00:41:14.580 --> 00:41:17.190 line:84%
in the Museum of Modern
Art, I'm not in the Whitney,

00:41:17.190 --> 00:41:20.070 line:84%
I've never been in Whitney
Annual, I'm not in the Met,

00:41:20.070 --> 00:41:22.320 line:84%
I'm not in any of
the major museums.

00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:23.460 line:90%
I'm not in the Pompidou.

00:41:23.460 --> 00:41:25.710 line:84%
They have the Woman House
film at the Pompidou,

00:41:25.710 --> 00:41:28.560 line:84%
and they don't own
anything of mine, OK?

00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:32.250 line:84%
The percentage of women
in major collections

00:41:32.250 --> 00:41:35.370 line:84%
is between 3% and
5% around the world.

00:41:35.370 --> 00:41:41.940 line:84%
And in terms of solo
publications, in the 1970s,

00:41:41.940 --> 00:41:47.550 line:84%
1.7% of solo publications
were devoted to women.

00:41:47.550 --> 00:41:50.190 line:84%
We are now 40 years
later and the percentage

00:41:50.190 --> 00:41:51.990 line:90%
is an astounding 2.5%.

00:41:54.690 --> 00:42:01.170 line:84%
So you know, why am I
talking about calling

00:42:01.170 --> 00:42:06.360 line:84%
for a national dialogue
to examine the kind of art

00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:08.640 line:90%
education that's going on?

00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:12.650 line:84%
Because, in the end
of the 19th century--

00:42:12.650 --> 00:42:16.350 line:84%
I mean you know this here
at Harvard or at Cambridge--

00:42:16.350 --> 00:42:20.460 line:84%
at the end of the 19th century
when women first managed

00:42:20.460 --> 00:42:22.410 line:84%
to get into higher
education, they

00:42:22.410 --> 00:42:27.480 line:84%
came into an entirely
male-centered curriculum.

00:42:27.480 --> 00:42:31.740 line:84%
And yeah, we've added
women's studies courses.

00:42:31.740 --> 00:42:36.770 line:84%
Yeah, we've added
feminist theory.

00:42:36.770 --> 00:42:39.920 line:84%
But studying Susan
B. Anthony is still

00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:43.430 line:84%
not part of every Western
Civilization class

00:42:43.430 --> 00:42:46.880 line:84%
that everybody, every boy
and every girl has to study.

00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:47.780 line:90%
Why not?

00:42:47.780 --> 00:42:51.110 line:84%
She changed the face
of a nation, OK?

00:42:51.110 --> 00:42:53.620 line:90%
Same thing in art education.

00:42:53.620 --> 00:42:56.810 line:84%
Art education-- women
were brought in,

00:42:56.810 --> 00:42:59.780 line:84%
expected to know
what a 4 by 4 was,

00:42:59.780 --> 00:43:01.910 line:84%
expected to paint
from the female model

00:43:01.910 --> 00:43:04.080 line:84%
when they finally could
get academic training

00:43:04.080 --> 00:43:07.070 line:84%
and paint from the nude,
without any thought about what

00:43:07.070 --> 00:43:09.560 line:90%
does that do to your psyche.

00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:13.140 line:84%
Here you are a woman artist,
painting a nude female.

00:43:13.140 --> 00:43:16.850 line:84%
Everybody else is
dressed and she's naked.

00:43:16.850 --> 00:43:20.330 line:84%
From what point of view
should I look at her?

00:43:20.330 --> 00:43:23.840 line:84%
Am I the model, or
am I the artist?

00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:25.910 line:84%
And do I have the same
level of privilege?

00:43:25.910 --> 00:43:30.630 line:84%
Obviously not, from
the statistics.

00:43:30.630 --> 00:43:35.000 line:84%
So now, as far as
I'm concerned, we

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:39.470 line:84%
should get 50% of the
space in all institutions.

00:43:39.470 --> 00:43:43.110 line:84%
That is what our
mandate has to be.

00:43:43.110 --> 00:43:45.490 line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:43:45.490 --> 00:43:46.420 line:90%
Thank you, so much.

00:43:46.420 --> 00:43:47.380 line:90%
I have more questions.

00:43:47.380 --> 00:43:51.760 line:84%
But I can tell from the
clapping that the audience is

00:43:51.760 --> 00:43:54.386 line:90%
eager to participate in this.

00:43:54.386 --> 00:43:55.760 line:84%
And I want to open
it up to them.

00:43:55.760 --> 00:44:00.885 line:84%
But let me first say, do have
a question you want to ask Judy

00:44:00.885 --> 00:44:02.980 line:90%
while we're here on stage?

00:44:05.950 --> 00:44:08.120 line:84%
I'd love to hear what
the audience has to say.

00:44:08.120 --> 00:44:10.200 line:84%
Do you want to ask Jane
something about her book

00:44:10.200 --> 00:44:12.190 line:84%
that you haven't
been able to ask yet?

00:44:12.190 --> 00:44:13.080 line:90%
I mean, I've had--

00:44:13.080 --> 00:44:15.870 line:84%
this is the forth dialogue
that Jane and I have had.

00:44:15.870 --> 00:44:19.170 line:84%
But the thing is is that,
before the first two

00:44:19.170 --> 00:44:20.244 line:90%
were just about her book.

00:44:20.244 --> 00:44:20.910 line:90%
I love her book.

00:44:20.910 --> 00:44:25.345 line:84%
I think, I mean, somebody
asked us at NMWA--

00:44:25.345 --> 00:44:26.470 line:90%
why do you call it "nemwa?"

00:44:26.470 --> 00:44:28.490 line:84%
Because the National
Museum of Women in the Arts

00:44:28.490 --> 00:44:31.860 line:84%
is too long to
say all the time--

00:44:31.860 --> 00:44:38.070 line:84%
asked about the
history that she tells

00:44:38.070 --> 00:44:40.785 line:84%
and how long it took
for The Dinner Party

00:44:40.785 --> 00:44:43.890 line:84%
to be permanently housed,
and all the myths that

00:44:43.890 --> 00:44:45.660 line:84%
surrounded The Dinner
Party, some of them

00:44:45.660 --> 00:44:48.300 line:90%
very personally painful to me.

00:44:48.300 --> 00:44:52.290 line:84%
And I said that a
long time ago, I

00:44:52.290 --> 00:44:55.200 line:84%
put my faith in history
and in art history.

00:44:55.200 --> 00:44:59.820 line:84%
It just took a really long time
for things to get sorted out.

00:44:59.820 --> 00:45:02.970 line:84%
And Jane sorted them out, in
terms of The Dinner Party.

00:45:02.970 --> 00:45:05.440 line:84%
And it's a great
read, lively, funny.

00:45:05.440 --> 00:45:06.060 line:90%
Perfect.

00:45:06.060 --> 00:45:06.810 line:90%
Yes.

00:45:06.810 --> 00:45:09.240 line:84%
Well, we have a microphone
here in the center

00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:11.920 line:84%
of the aisle and anyone who
would like to ask a question,

00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:14.640 line:90%
please step up to the mic.

00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:16.890 line:84%
I'm Ann [? Broughty, ?]
and I grew up

00:45:16.890 --> 00:45:19.080 line:84%
in LA when you were
making all kinds

00:45:19.080 --> 00:45:22.330 line:90%
of glorious trouble in town.

00:45:22.330 --> 00:45:28.230 line:84%
And it was a really vivid part
of being a teenager in LA.

00:45:28.230 --> 00:45:31.440 line:84%
I never went, myself,
to the Women's Building

00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:34.980 line:84%
or to Santa Monica to
work on The Dinner Party,

00:45:34.980 --> 00:45:39.270 line:84%
but it was so much a
part of what people were

00:45:39.270 --> 00:45:42.570 line:90%
talking about and experiencing.

00:45:42.570 --> 00:45:45.480 line:84%
It's really hard, as a
historian and a teacher,

00:45:45.480 --> 00:45:50.190 line:84%
to recapture for students
what the women's only spaces

00:45:50.190 --> 00:45:57.270 line:84%
of the 1970s meant in the kind
of revolutionary iconoclasm

00:45:57.270 --> 00:46:02.310 line:84%
of just exploding everything
that we had grown up

00:46:02.310 --> 00:46:06.060 line:84%
with about being female and the
limitations that that meant.

00:46:06.060 --> 00:46:09.420 line:84%
So the question that I
would love to ask you

00:46:09.420 --> 00:46:12.180 line:84%
is about your really
interesting statement,

00:46:12.180 --> 00:46:14.940 line:84%
that we made a mistake
by focusing exclusively

00:46:14.940 --> 00:46:16.880 line:90%
on gender in the 1970s.

00:46:16.880 --> 00:46:20.535 line:84%
No, by casting a discourse
entirely around gender,

00:46:20.535 --> 00:46:25.350 line:84%
as if you could only have
access to these ideas

00:46:25.350 --> 00:46:27.410 line:90%
if you were a woman.

00:46:27.410 --> 00:46:31.740 line:84%
So that's such a powerful issue
for us to be thinking about.

00:46:31.740 --> 00:46:35.370 line:84%
And I love the way you
suggested that it's

00:46:35.370 --> 00:46:39.170 line:84%
values that are really the
foundation of feminism.

00:46:39.170 --> 00:46:41.160 line:84%
I just wonder if
you could help us

00:46:41.160 --> 00:46:44.340 line:90%
think about this historically?

00:46:44.340 --> 00:46:52.800 line:84%
How clearly people did feel a
necessity to focus on gender

00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:57.480 line:84%
and to create women only
spaces and experiences.

00:46:57.480 --> 00:47:01.500 line:84%
And was that a
historical moment?

00:47:01.500 --> 00:47:03.480 line:84%
Well, actually, I'd
like to answer that

00:47:03.480 --> 00:47:05.940 line:84%
slightly differently,
because it actually

00:47:05.940 --> 00:47:10.990 line:84%
ties in with my points
in Institutional

00:47:10.990 --> 00:47:13.590 line:84%
Time about the
institutional failure

00:47:13.590 --> 00:47:15.930 line:84%
to transmit our
history, to transmit

00:47:15.930 --> 00:47:19.240 line:84%
the history, for example, of
this Feminist Art Movement.

00:47:19.240 --> 00:47:23.430 line:84%
And what that is present
in young people with today,

00:47:23.430 --> 00:47:25.770 line:90%
in Los Angeles, for example.

00:47:25.770 --> 00:47:31.510 line:84%
So Cal Arts where I brought
my Feminist Art program that

00:47:31.510 --> 00:47:34.560 line:84%
did Woman House, where
we did Woman House,

00:47:34.560 --> 00:47:37.800 line:84%
erased the history of
the Feminist Art program

00:47:37.800 --> 00:47:40.620 line:90%
from its institutional memory.

00:47:40.620 --> 00:47:45.420 line:84%
And in the 1990s,
some young students

00:47:45.420 --> 00:47:48.930 line:84%
discovered the archives of
the Feminist Art program

00:47:48.930 --> 00:47:51.750 line:84%
in the garbage
and retrieved them

00:47:51.750 --> 00:47:54.720 line:84%
and did a whole show
in a symposium called

00:47:54.720 --> 00:47:57.000 line:90%
The "F" Word, OK?

00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:03.120 line:84%
Now Cal Arts has recently
begun to acknowledge

00:48:03.120 --> 00:48:06.000 line:84%
Woman House and the
Feminist Art program,

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:08.730 line:84%
but that was is only,
in my estimation,

00:48:08.730 --> 00:48:13.140 line:84%
because of the Getty-funded,
Pacific Standard Time,

00:48:13.140 --> 00:48:17.430 line:84%
$14 million initiative
which documented

00:48:17.430 --> 00:48:21.570 line:84%
and celebrated Southern
California art from 1945

00:48:21.570 --> 00:48:22.920 line:90%
to 1980.

00:48:22.920 --> 00:48:26.340 line:84%
And one of the projects
that they funded

00:48:26.340 --> 00:48:30.300 line:84%
was a two-volume book
about the Woman's Building

00:48:30.300 --> 00:48:32.100 line:90%
and the Feminist Art Movement.

00:48:32.100 --> 00:48:35.640 line:84%
So it would have been a little
embarrassing for Cal Art

00:48:35.640 --> 00:48:38.610 line:84%
to say, oh, leave us out of
that book, will you please?

00:48:38.610 --> 00:48:40.560 line:90%
OK, so there's that.

00:48:40.560 --> 00:48:46.740 line:84%
And as a result of that,
young women students still

00:48:46.740 --> 00:48:48.760 line:90%
are having to do it themselves.

00:48:48.760 --> 00:48:52.530 line:84%
So there's a young woman
artist in Los Angeles named

00:48:52.530 --> 00:48:56.160 line:84%
Audrey Chan, she's Asian,
she's a performance artist.

00:48:56.160 --> 00:48:58.950 line:84%
And she was talking
about actually

00:48:58.950 --> 00:49:02.880 line:84%
what you just mentioned,
was the sort of aura

00:49:02.880 --> 00:49:09.270 line:84%
of the 1970s and my presence,
knit symbolic presence there,

00:49:09.270 --> 00:49:11.040 line:90%
even if I wasn't there.

00:49:11.040 --> 00:49:14.430 line:84%
And so in order to
have access to me,

00:49:14.430 --> 00:49:18.230 line:90%
she started performing as me.

00:49:18.230 --> 00:49:21.020 line:84%
And she did this
wonderful videotape

00:49:21.020 --> 00:49:24.200 line:84%
called, How I Became a
Feminist Artist Without Living

00:49:24.200 --> 00:49:25.260 line:90%
Through the '70s.

00:49:25.260 --> 00:49:26.540 line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:26.540 --> 00:49:30.200 line:84%
And now she's instituted an
intergenerational dialogue

00:49:30.200 --> 00:49:32.450 line:84%
with me that's going
to become a book.

00:49:32.450 --> 00:49:36.200 line:84%
But my point is, that they
have to do it all themselves,

00:49:36.200 --> 00:49:40.010 line:84%
because the institutions
are not doing it.

00:49:40.010 --> 00:49:43.100 line:84%
That art programs are
not teaching young women

00:49:43.100 --> 00:49:45.420 line:84%
about the history of the
Feminist Art Movement.

00:49:45.420 --> 00:49:48.260 line:84%
They're not teaching
them about the legacy

00:49:48.260 --> 00:49:50.832 line:90%
of the '70s Women's Building.

00:49:50.832 --> 00:49:52.790 line:84%
In fact, there's a group
of young women artists

00:49:52.790 --> 00:49:57.500 line:84%
who are trying to rent the
Spring Street Women's Building

00:49:57.500 --> 00:50:02.780 line:84%
and set up another women's
collective in there,

00:50:02.780 --> 00:50:06.470 line:84%
because the need is still there
and the institutions are still

00:50:06.470 --> 00:50:10.140 line:90%
failing, is my answer.

00:50:10.140 --> 00:50:11.130 line:90%
Hi, who are you?

00:50:11.130 --> 00:50:13.770 line:90%
Hi.

00:50:13.770 --> 00:50:15.480 line:90%
I'm a painter from Iran.

00:50:15.480 --> 00:50:18.300 line:90%
I live and work in Tehran.

00:50:18.300 --> 00:50:20.206 line:90%
I'm here for a short time.

00:50:20.206 --> 00:50:21.080 line:90%
I'm lucky to be here.

00:50:21.080 --> 00:50:25.080 line:90%
My heart is pumping fast.

00:50:25.080 --> 00:50:30.840 line:84%
You inspired me and many
other artists in my country

00:50:30.840 --> 00:50:32.960 line:90%
and around the world.

00:50:32.960 --> 00:50:34.930 line:90%
I am self-taught.

00:50:34.930 --> 00:50:43.490 line:84%
I haven't MFA, or I haven't
been in any Academy at all,

00:50:43.490 --> 00:50:49.920 line:84%
but I'm known, I think, as an
anti-war painter in my country

00:50:49.920 --> 00:50:52.860 line:90%
and around.

00:50:52.860 --> 00:50:57.660 line:84%
I like to use this
chance here to ask you,

00:50:57.660 --> 00:51:02.850 line:84%
what would you tell me
to help my career there?

00:51:02.850 --> 00:51:03.770 line:90%
Mm.

00:51:03.770 --> 00:51:10.340 line:84%
I was in this show some years
ago with a young Iranian woman

00:51:10.340 --> 00:51:12.530 line:90%
artist.

00:51:12.530 --> 00:51:17.850 line:84%
It was an international show
in the Bay Area in California.

00:51:17.850 --> 00:51:21.630 line:84%
And she brought the
whole audience to tears

00:51:21.630 --> 00:51:25.050 line:84%
because she talked about
what she had to do in order

00:51:25.050 --> 00:51:28.020 line:90%
to get her work out of Iran.

00:51:28.020 --> 00:51:31.980 line:84%
Her husband was an engineer
from a prominent family,

00:51:31.980 --> 00:51:35.940 line:84%
and they had to
sneak her work out

00:51:35.940 --> 00:51:38.730 line:84%
through Federal
Express at midnight,

00:51:38.730 --> 00:51:43.230 line:84%
because she was dealing with
the subject of the harem.

00:51:43.230 --> 00:51:44.629 line:90%
Actually, she told us all--

00:51:44.629 --> 00:51:45.420 line:90%
I didn't know this.

00:51:45.420 --> 00:51:47.850 line:84%
You couldn't have whole
bananas or whole zucchinis

00:51:47.850 --> 00:51:48.990 line:90%
or anything in the harem.

00:51:48.990 --> 00:51:50.370 line:90%
Did you know that?

00:51:50.370 --> 00:51:51.900 line:90%
They'd always slice them up.

00:51:54.540 --> 00:51:59.790 line:84%
But anyway, I mean,
it was the first time,

00:51:59.790 --> 00:52:03.040 line:84%
when she was speaking
about her work,

00:52:03.040 --> 00:52:05.310 line:84%
it was the first
time she had ever

00:52:05.310 --> 00:52:08.850 line:84%
tried to traverse from
the private life she

00:52:08.850 --> 00:52:11.490 line:90%
had to live there--

00:52:11.490 --> 00:52:12.640 line:90%
Same story.

00:52:12.640 --> 00:52:13.770 line:90%
--to the public.

00:52:13.770 --> 00:52:14.630 line:90%
Yeah.

00:52:14.630 --> 00:52:18.170 line:90%
And she was shaking.

00:52:18.170 --> 00:52:22.840 line:90%
I-- I don't know how to--

00:52:22.840 --> 00:52:26.590 line:84%
I went and stood behind her
to try and give her courage.

00:52:26.590 --> 00:52:29.005 line:90%
I mean, that's all we can--

00:52:29.005 --> 00:52:33.115 line:84%
I could do is say you,
you know, here's my hand.

00:52:36.810 --> 00:52:44.100 line:84%
I don't know, because we have
to fight for even basic rights,

00:52:44.100 --> 00:52:51.240 line:84%
not with government, even with
our families and loved ones.

00:52:51.240 --> 00:52:52.920 line:90%
That's not only in Iran.

00:52:52.920 --> 00:52:53.551 line:90%
Yeah.

00:52:53.551 --> 00:52:54.050 line:90%
I'm sure.

00:52:54.050 --> 00:52:56.740 line:84%
Believe me, when I was
doing The Birth Project

00:52:56.740 --> 00:53:00.630 line:84%
and I was working with
women in their homes,

00:53:00.630 --> 00:53:02.280 line:84%
they had to fight
with their loved ones

00:53:02.280 --> 00:53:05.220 line:84%
too, in order to even
get time to work.

00:53:05.220 --> 00:53:06.310 line:90%
Yes.

00:53:06.310 --> 00:53:14.430 line:84%
And I stayed 20 years in
my studio and just worked.

00:53:14.430 --> 00:53:19.230 line:84%
And I knew this work related to
war, no one wanted to see them.

00:53:19.230 --> 00:53:22.140 line:84%
When the government
came to buy some of them

00:53:22.140 --> 00:53:27.300 line:84%
for war and veterans
museum, I refused, because I

00:53:27.300 --> 00:53:28.710 line:90%
didn't want to be part of them.

00:53:28.710 --> 00:53:30.610 line:90%
I'm against them, you know?

00:53:30.610 --> 00:53:38.810 line:84%
And the thing that I think
I really doesn't had,

00:53:38.810 --> 00:53:42.530 line:84%
because we sanctioned
our government institutes

00:53:42.530 --> 00:53:47.010 line:84%
like museums, I never sent a
work to a museum in Tehran,

00:53:47.010 --> 00:53:47.510 line:90%
you know.

00:53:47.510 --> 00:53:56.900 line:84%
And how people think here about
this, they censored my book.

00:53:56.900 --> 00:53:59.870 line:84%
I had to publish my
book out of the country,

00:53:59.870 --> 00:54:04.940 line:84%
in Iraq, because I didn't want
them to get censored again.

00:54:04.940 --> 00:54:10.110 line:84%
Because for me, all of them
have meanings together.

00:54:10.110 --> 00:54:19.350 line:84%
This is a series about war, my
personal life with a veteran

00:54:19.350 --> 00:54:25.060 line:84%
and with others who
had endured mentally,

00:54:25.060 --> 00:54:29.130 line:84%
emotionally, physically,
even myself, during the war.

00:54:29.130 --> 00:54:33.480 line:84%
And after the revolution,
during all the hard time we had,

00:54:33.480 --> 00:54:38.235 line:84%
or the protests we had
in [? grieve ?] movement.

00:54:41.980 --> 00:54:46.720 line:84%
You know, it's very difficult.
Because now, new generations

00:54:46.720 --> 00:54:49.920 line:84%
after me, they're
brought up with media

00:54:49.920 --> 00:54:53.200 line:84%
and know so many other
things, you know.

00:54:53.200 --> 00:54:57.670 line:84%
I believe the generations
change every five years.

00:54:57.670 --> 00:55:06.850 line:84%
And as you said, the connections
and network is very important,

00:55:06.850 --> 00:55:10.090 line:84%
and we don't have it, because
we don't have access to--

00:55:10.090 --> 00:55:12.820 line:84%
All I can say is, in
this case, the way women

00:55:12.820 --> 00:55:15.940 line:84%
built networks of
support, I mean

00:55:15.940 --> 00:55:21.520 line:84%
women built networks of support
for not just since the 1970s

00:55:21.520 --> 00:55:25.090 line:84%
here, I mean, it's what Gerda
Lerner, the women's historian

00:55:25.090 --> 00:55:27.940 line:84%
talked about, women
building affinity groups.

00:55:27.940 --> 00:55:30.970 line:84%
I mean, you have to have
your own affinity groups.

00:55:30.970 --> 00:55:34.060 line:84%
You just have to have
your own affinity group,

00:55:34.060 --> 00:55:36.555 line:84%
however you can
put that together.

00:55:36.555 --> 00:55:39.377 line:84%
I think we'll have to let other
people-- there's a long line--

00:55:39.377 --> 00:55:40.210 line:90%
ask their questions.

00:55:40.210 --> 00:55:41.590 line:90%
OK, thank you very much.

00:55:41.590 --> 00:55:42.610 line:90%
Who are you?

00:55:42.610 --> 00:55:45.670 line:84%
I want to give a name
to that previous artist.

00:55:45.670 --> 00:55:47.260 line:90%
She did not give her name.

00:55:47.260 --> 00:55:49.480 line:90%
So that is Minu Emami.

00:55:49.480 --> 00:55:51.760 line:84%
So let's look out
for her, and let's

00:55:51.760 --> 00:55:55.960 line:84%
make our own affirmative
network for her.

00:55:55.960 --> 00:55:57.770 line:90%
I'm an art historian.

00:55:57.770 --> 00:56:00.220 line:84%
I've met Judy Chicago
briefly in the past,

00:56:00.220 --> 00:56:02.020 line:90%
my name is Caroline Jones.

00:56:02.020 --> 00:56:05.350 line:84%
And I teach feminist
art whenever I can.

00:56:05.350 --> 00:56:07.630 line:84%
And my question is to
surface a little bit

00:56:07.630 --> 00:56:10.900 line:84%
of a paradox,
because we've heard

00:56:10.900 --> 00:56:15.070 line:84%
a lot about the failures
of academic feminism,

00:56:15.070 --> 00:56:19.550 line:84%
of the Academy in
general, of art teaching.

00:56:19.550 --> 00:56:23.590 line:84%
And yet, these wonderful
papers are here

00:56:23.590 --> 00:56:27.260 line:90%
in the heart of the Academy.

00:56:27.260 --> 00:56:31.990 line:84%
So the question is,
what are we to do?

00:56:31.990 --> 00:56:39.520 line:84%
Should the Academy do its best
to make history and pedagogical

00:56:39.520 --> 00:56:44.260 line:84%
objects, teaching objects,
books about popular feminism?

00:56:44.260 --> 00:56:50.470 line:84%
Or should we also continue to
do the work of theory, which

00:56:50.470 --> 00:56:52.750 line:90%
is also what the Academy does?

00:56:52.750 --> 00:56:55.580 line:84%
So you know, I
leave that question.

00:56:55.580 --> 00:56:57.280 line:90%
I don't need to stand here.

00:56:57.280 --> 00:57:01.570 line:84%
But to me, in a way,
it's a beautiful paradox

00:57:01.570 --> 00:57:04.030 line:84%
that we're left with here at
Radcliffe, which has always

00:57:04.030 --> 00:57:06.880 line:84%
been two kinds of
institutions-- it's always

00:57:06.880 --> 00:57:11.940 line:84%
been embedded in a large
university educational machine.

00:57:11.940 --> 00:57:14.850 line:90%
And it's also been a community.

00:57:14.850 --> 00:57:18.150 line:84%
So I'd leave those as
provocative questions

00:57:18.150 --> 00:57:23.640 line:84%
about the future of your papers
and the historians of the same.

00:57:23.640 --> 00:57:27.230 line:84%
I would like to respond
with a quote from Bell Hooks

00:57:27.230 --> 00:57:31.890 line:84%
that I use in Institutional
Time, in the chapter,

00:57:31.890 --> 00:57:34.250 line:90%
So What's the Answer?

00:57:34.250 --> 00:57:38.290 line:84%
"The classroom, with
all its limitations,

00:57:38.290 --> 00:57:41.560 line:84%
remains a location
of possibility.

00:57:41.560 --> 00:57:45.430 line:84%
In that field of possibility,
we have the opportunity

00:57:45.430 --> 00:57:50.200 line:84%
to labor for freedom, to demand
of ourselves and our comrades

00:57:50.200 --> 00:57:55.570 line:84%
an openness of mind and heart
that allows us to face reality,

00:57:55.570 --> 00:58:00.880 line:84%
even as we collectively imagine
ways to move beyond boundaries

00:58:00.880 --> 00:58:02.830 line:90%
to transgress.

00:58:02.830 --> 00:58:06.944 line:84%
This is education as the
practice of freedom."

00:58:06.944 --> 00:58:07.581 line:90%
Go, Bell.

00:58:07.581 --> 00:58:08.080 line:90%
OK.

00:58:10.900 --> 00:58:13.120 line:90%
Could I also respond?

00:58:13.120 --> 00:58:15.460 line:84%
I think it's important--
feminist theory

00:58:15.460 --> 00:58:18.400 line:84%
is-- there is always a
place for feminist theory.

00:58:18.400 --> 00:58:22.330 line:84%
I think it's also important
to have popular feminist--

00:58:22.330 --> 00:58:26.410 line:84%
histories of popular
feminism, because translation

00:58:26.410 --> 00:58:27.790 line:90%
has to happen.

00:58:27.790 --> 00:58:32.670 line:84%
Feminist ideas
need to circulate.

00:58:32.670 --> 00:58:35.420 line:84%
They're not only
consumed in a classroom.

00:58:35.420 --> 00:58:37.480 line:84%
And so the translation
of those ideas

00:58:37.480 --> 00:58:40.570 line:84%
into a lot of different
medium, and as those

00:58:40.570 --> 00:58:42.970 line:84%
mediums interact
with audiences who

00:58:42.970 --> 00:58:45.460 line:84%
aren't in women's
studies classes,

00:58:45.460 --> 00:58:47.560 line:90%
those ideas are contagious.

00:58:47.560 --> 00:58:48.790 line:90%
They can get people thinking.

00:58:52.300 --> 00:58:55.300 line:84%
That sort of transmission
of feminist theory

00:58:55.300 --> 00:59:00.100 line:84%
broadly is a story that
we need to tell, as well.

00:59:00.100 --> 00:59:03.010 line:84%
So I think it's
important to make place

00:59:03.010 --> 00:59:06.170 line:84%
for both of these, at least
these two kinds of feminism--

00:59:06.170 --> 00:59:09.280 line:84%
there's so many kinds,
so many kinds of ways

00:59:09.280 --> 00:59:12.340 line:90%
to apply feminist theory.

00:59:12.340 --> 00:59:15.640 line:84%
And I think in the Academy
we've tended to privilege

00:59:15.640 --> 00:59:17.880 line:90%
certain ones over others.

00:59:17.880 --> 00:59:20.950 line:84%
So yeah, my book was
about trying to broaden

00:59:20.950 --> 00:59:24.430 line:90%
that out a little more.

00:59:24.430 --> 00:59:26.810 line:90%
Hello, I'm Edie Shimel.

00:59:26.810 --> 00:59:29.480 line:84%
I'm actually the Youth
Programs Coordinator

00:59:29.480 --> 00:59:32.390 line:90%
at the Peabody Essex Museum.

00:59:32.390 --> 00:59:35.030 line:84%
Oh, I'm the Youth Programs
Coordinator at the Peabody

00:59:35.030 --> 00:59:38.580 line:84%
Essex Museum and I've been in
museum education for a while.

00:59:38.580 --> 00:59:44.360 line:84%
I was at the ICA before working
with the subsidized programs,

00:59:44.360 --> 00:59:47.990 line:84%
like teen programs, things like
that for after school groups

00:59:47.990 --> 00:59:53.480 line:84%
who don't necessarily have
access to much of anything.

00:59:53.480 --> 00:59:55.550 line:84%
Which is, I think,
what you were talking

00:59:55.550 --> 00:59:57.560 line:84%
about when the
discourse is now sort

00:59:57.560 --> 01:00:02.720 line:84%
of the general, social
injustice that feminists art

01:00:02.720 --> 01:00:07.610 line:84%
history and just all of that
kind of works its way into.

01:00:07.610 --> 01:00:15.370 line:84%
And my question is, how, as
someone who's working with

01:00:15.370 --> 01:00:20.140 line:84%
younger populations who really,
some of them are getting

01:00:20.140 --> 01:00:24.940 line:84%
their first sort of art
experiences through the museum

01:00:24.940 --> 01:00:33.848 line:84%
and through me, how does
one, I don't know if you know

01:00:33.848 --> 01:00:37.400 line:84%
the ans-- how do you
sort of distill--

01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:39.890 line:84%
like when is it
time to sort of pull

01:00:39.890 --> 01:00:48.030 line:84%
the nuances of social injustice
and historic injustice

01:00:48.030 --> 01:00:52.950 line:84%
and women's injustice within
this sort of community arts

01:00:52.950 --> 01:00:54.010 line:90%
context?

01:00:54.010 --> 01:00:55.950 line:84%
Because I think that
there's a lot of room

01:00:55.950 --> 01:00:58.770 line:84%
for more depth within
our collection,

01:00:58.770 --> 01:01:05.300 line:84%
but I just don't really know
anybody that's doing that.

01:01:05.300 --> 01:01:09.650 line:84%
And I didn't know if you knew
anybody or had never thought

01:01:09.650 --> 01:01:10.670 line:90%
about that?

01:01:10.670 --> 01:01:14.690 line:84%
I could go into any community
and using my pedagogy,

01:01:14.690 --> 01:01:16.760 line:84%
all the issues of
social injustice,

01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:19.190 line:84%
gender injustice,
abuse, whatever

01:01:19.190 --> 01:01:21.110 line:84%
it is they're experiencing
would come out.

01:01:21.110 --> 01:01:25.940 line:84%
Because what I have always
practiced and am advocating

01:01:25.940 --> 01:01:30.770 line:84%
in Institutional Time is a
content-based artist education,

01:01:30.770 --> 01:01:33.410 line:84%
where people start
with who they are

01:01:33.410 --> 01:01:37.850 line:84%
and a circle pedagogy,
where people open up

01:01:37.850 --> 01:01:38.900 line:90%
about who they are.

01:01:38.900 --> 01:01:42.890 line:84%
And before two or three
weeks has gone by,

01:01:42.890 --> 01:01:46.280 line:84%
they will have revealed
all the injustice

01:01:46.280 --> 01:01:48.110 line:90%
that they have experienced.

01:01:48.110 --> 01:01:50.660 line:84%
They will be in it
before they-- they

01:01:50.660 --> 01:01:52.310 line:84%
don't have to
intellectualize it.

01:01:52.310 --> 01:01:55.680 line:84%
You don't have to introduce
it, because they've already

01:01:55.680 --> 01:01:57.260 line:90%
experienced it.

01:01:57.260 --> 01:02:01.480 line:84%
You just have to help them
say and what they have to say.

01:02:01.480 --> 01:02:03.670 line:90%
Thanks.

01:02:03.670 --> 01:02:06.750 line:90%
Where's Constance?

01:02:06.750 --> 01:02:08.280 line:90%
Constance, where are you?

01:02:08.280 --> 01:02:11.630 line:90%
Constance Gee is right here.

01:02:11.630 --> 01:02:15.590 line:84%
She spent a lot of her
years as an art educator.

01:02:15.590 --> 01:02:17.570 line:84%
Donald and I first
met her when she

01:02:17.570 --> 01:02:20.990 line:84%
was the First Lady
of Vanderbilt.

01:02:20.990 --> 01:02:25.670 line:84%
And she's the one who
guided us, guided me

01:02:25.670 --> 01:02:29.420 line:84%
into an understanding of some
of the changes that are taking

01:02:29.420 --> 01:02:34.520 line:84%
place in K through 12 curriculum
around gender, social justice,

01:02:34.520 --> 01:02:37.880 line:84%
race, ethnicity,
sexual orientation.

01:02:37.880 --> 01:02:39.050 line:90%
I mean there's a huge--

01:02:39.050 --> 01:02:41.810 line:84%
you should read a book
by Marilyn Stewart called

01:02:41.810 --> 01:02:44.360 line:90%
Rethinking Curriculum in Art.

01:02:44.360 --> 01:02:46.550 line:84%
That's another
thing I talk about

01:02:46.550 --> 01:02:50.450 line:84%
in Institutional Time is that,
you know, just like nobody paid

01:02:50.450 --> 01:02:52.940 line:84%
attention to the China
painters or the needle workers

01:02:52.940 --> 01:02:57.320 line:84%
because they were women when I
was trying to bring that over,

01:02:57.320 --> 01:03:00.290 line:84%
a lot of the work has been
done in K through 12 art

01:03:00.290 --> 01:03:04.400 line:84%
education has not been looked at
in the university, because art

01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:07.430 line:84%
education in K through 12 is
generally dominated by women.

01:03:07.430 --> 01:03:09.770 line:84%
But they've been doing
an enormous amount

01:03:09.770 --> 01:03:11.870 line:90%
of work in all these areas.

01:03:11.870 --> 01:03:15.120 line:90%
Rethinking Curriculum in Art.

01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:15.900 line:90%
Yes.

01:03:15.900 --> 01:03:18.460 line:84%
Hi, my name Beth
[? Ankus. ?] I'm an artist.

01:03:18.460 --> 01:03:21.330 line:84%
I went to a local
women's college.

01:03:21.330 --> 01:03:22.920 line:84%
And I was wondering
your perspective

01:03:22.920 --> 01:03:25.190 line:90%
on art at all women's colleges.

01:03:25.190 --> 01:03:26.820 line:84%
How studio art should
be taught there?

01:03:26.820 --> 01:03:28.860 line:84%
Because from what
I've seen, it's

01:03:28.860 --> 01:03:31.530 line:84%
being minimized quite a
bit in favor of biology

01:03:31.530 --> 01:03:33.160 line:90%
and certain other things.

01:03:33.160 --> 01:03:36.540 line:84%
And I just wanted
your thoughts on what

01:03:36.540 --> 01:03:38.250 line:84%
art studio and art
history should be

01:03:38.250 --> 01:03:41.130 line:90%
like at all women's colleges?

01:03:41.130 --> 01:03:44.080 line:84%
I actually talk about it
in Institutional Time.

01:03:44.080 --> 01:03:47.590 line:84%
I was invited to go to
Moore College of Art.

01:03:47.590 --> 01:03:48.840 line:90%
Actually, I was invited twice.

01:03:48.840 --> 01:03:51.260 line:84%
The first time I went
there was in the 1980s.

01:03:51.260 --> 01:03:54.300 line:84%
Moore was the only art
college for women in America.

01:03:54.300 --> 01:03:56.580 line:84%
The first time I went
there was in the '80s.

01:03:56.580 --> 01:04:00.897 line:90%
And it was an all-male faculty.

01:04:00.897 --> 01:04:03.105 line:84%
That was definitely not how
it should've been taught.

01:04:03.105 --> 01:04:06.090 line:84%
But anyway, in fact,
it was a good thing

01:04:06.090 --> 01:04:09.960 line:84%
that the elevator door closed
rather rapidly, because one

01:04:09.960 --> 01:04:12.990 line:84%
of the male faculty followed
Donald and me to the elevator

01:04:12.990 --> 01:04:16.140 line:84%
and said, I wish I were a
woman, a black, or a chimpanzee

01:04:16.140 --> 01:04:19.080 line:84%
so I could get
affirmative action.

01:04:19.080 --> 01:04:21.630 line:84%
The elevator door
closed, or Donald would

01:04:21.630 --> 01:04:23.580 line:90%
have punched him in the face.

01:04:23.580 --> 01:04:29.390 line:84%
But anyway, I went
back because there

01:04:29.390 --> 01:04:31.560 line:84%
was a wonderful woman
named Happy Fernandez who

01:04:31.560 --> 01:04:35.730 line:84%
took it over, was trying to
decolonize it and change it.

01:04:35.730 --> 01:04:37.980 line:84%
Anyway, so she asked
me to come back.

01:04:37.980 --> 01:04:41.610 line:84%
And I mean, I was shocked
to discover-- well,

01:04:41.610 --> 01:04:46.230 line:84%
first of all, the young
women were very puzzled

01:04:46.230 --> 01:04:47.850 line:90%
by their art education.

01:04:47.850 --> 01:04:50.840 line:84%
I did critiques with
several of them,

01:04:50.840 --> 01:04:53.130 line:84%
I mean with several classes,
juniors and seniors.

01:04:53.130 --> 01:04:55.410 line:84%
They were very puzzled,
because for the first two

01:04:55.410 --> 01:04:58.350 line:84%
years of their
art education they

01:04:58.350 --> 01:05:00.750 line:84%
talked about nothing
but form and materials.

01:05:00.750 --> 01:05:02.940 line:84%
And then in junior
year they were suddenly

01:05:02.940 --> 01:05:05.700 line:84%
supposed to have
personal content.

01:05:05.700 --> 01:05:08.700 line:84%
And they had no idea how
to access their own subject

01:05:08.700 --> 01:05:11.560 line:84%
matter, which isn't that
hard to do, actually.

01:05:11.560 --> 01:05:14.940 line:90%
It was frustrating.

01:05:14.940 --> 01:05:19.260 line:84%
So, I mean, we
talked about content,

01:05:19.260 --> 01:05:21.450 line:84%
which was the first
time they'd ever

01:05:21.450 --> 01:05:23.040 line:84%
had the opportunity
to talk about what

01:05:23.040 --> 01:05:25.050 line:84%
their real intentions
were in art.

01:05:25.050 --> 01:05:29.280 line:84%
Because not only
is art education--

01:05:29.280 --> 01:05:31.980 line:84%
is there de-skilling going
on in studio art education,

01:05:31.980 --> 01:05:34.590 line:84%
there's almost no
discussion of content.

01:05:34.590 --> 01:05:37.350 line:84%
And although it's a
generalization to say this,

01:05:37.350 --> 01:05:40.290 line:84%
I've worked with literally
hundreds and hundreds of women.

01:05:40.290 --> 01:05:43.920 line:84%
And by and large, women approach
art making from a content base

01:05:43.920 --> 01:05:45.120 line:90%
more than men.

01:05:45.120 --> 01:05:49.310 line:84%
And the way art school is set
up, that is not addressed.

01:05:49.310 --> 01:05:53.025 line:84%
So they are not helped, in terms
of developing their own voices.

01:05:55.940 --> 01:05:59.686 line:84%
And the other thing at
Moore that I was shocked at

01:05:59.686 --> 01:06:01.560 line:84%
was that there were
almost no women's studies

01:06:01.560 --> 01:06:04.260 line:90%
courses, no feminist theory.

01:06:04.260 --> 01:06:05.940 line:90%
I mean, it was--

01:06:05.940 --> 01:06:08.820 line:84%
so, I mean, I have
seen examples of what

01:06:08.820 --> 01:06:14.670 line:84%
not to do more often than I've
seen examples of what to do.

01:06:14.670 --> 01:06:18.650 line:84%
But certainly at
a women's college,

01:06:18.650 --> 01:06:21.620 line:84%
women ought to have
the opportunity

01:06:21.620 --> 01:06:25.280 line:84%
to learn their history, to
see what women before them

01:06:25.280 --> 01:06:27.620 line:90%
thought, taught, and created.

01:06:27.620 --> 01:06:29.900 line:84%
It ought to be integrated
into the curriculum.

01:06:29.900 --> 01:06:33.710 line:84%
And they ought to be helped
to find their own voices.

01:06:33.710 --> 01:06:34.440 line:90%
That help?

01:06:34.440 --> 01:06:34.940 line:90%
Oh, yeah.

01:06:34.940 --> 01:06:36.090 line:90%
Do you agree?

01:06:36.090 --> 01:06:36.850 line:90%
Definitely.

01:06:36.850 --> 01:06:38.383 line:90%
Thanks, OK.

01:06:38.383 --> 01:06:39.210 line:90%
How about that?

01:06:39.210 --> 01:06:39.770 line:90%
Hi.

01:06:39.770 --> 01:06:41.600 line:84%
I'm Colleen [? Emmerman. ?]
So I actually

01:06:41.600 --> 01:06:44.360 line:84%
work here across the river
at the Business School

01:06:44.360 --> 01:06:46.070 line:84%
on a gender
initiative over there.

01:06:46.070 --> 01:06:49.290 line:84%
So I have a very kind
of general question

01:06:49.290 --> 01:06:51.710 line:84%
that I would love to hear
either or both of you speak to,

01:06:51.710 --> 01:06:54.230 line:84%
and it's going back to this
term from the title Popular

01:06:54.230 --> 01:06:55.560 line:90%
Feminism.

01:06:55.560 --> 01:06:58.281 line:84%
So it seems to me like a
lot of what you both have

01:06:58.281 --> 01:06:59.780 line:84%
been in this dialogue,
talking about

01:06:59.780 --> 01:07:01.760 line:84%
is sort of the long
history of feminism

01:07:01.760 --> 01:07:05.810 line:84%
as a social movement from
the people exerting pressure

01:07:05.810 --> 01:07:09.000 line:84%
on institutions and
still doing that.

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.900 line:84%
But it seems to me another
way to think about this term,

01:07:11.900 --> 01:07:14.810 line:84%
or another thing that's
conjured in my mind,

01:07:14.810 --> 01:07:18.620 line:84%
seems to me today that something
like feminism or something

01:07:18.620 --> 01:07:20.930 line:84%
called feminism has
a kind of popularity

01:07:20.930 --> 01:07:23.960 line:84%
and a kind of currency and a
kind of mainstream presence

01:07:23.960 --> 01:07:27.720 line:84%
that it's not had before,
certainly not in my lifetime.

01:07:27.720 --> 01:07:31.010 line:84%
And so I'm just really curious,
sort of, what your assessment

01:07:31.010 --> 01:07:32.300 line:90%
or sense of that is?

01:07:32.300 --> 01:07:35.780 line:84%
And whether it's something
that leaves you hopeful or not,

01:07:35.780 --> 01:07:38.300 line:84%
sort of, what your
take on that is?

01:07:38.300 --> 01:07:39.680 line:90%
The historian's question?

01:07:39.680 --> 01:07:40.400 line:90%
Yeah.

01:07:40.400 --> 01:07:44.240 line:84%
Well, so much of '70s
feminism succeeded.

01:07:44.240 --> 01:07:45.830 line:90%
It was kind of a way--

01:07:45.830 --> 01:07:49.730 line:84%
so much changed as a result
of the wave of activism

01:07:49.730 --> 01:07:53.310 line:84%
in the '60s through
the mid-'80s.

01:07:53.310 --> 01:07:55.670 line:84%
And one of the successes
of the movement

01:07:55.670 --> 01:07:59.270 line:84%
is that it's available as
a commodity in the market,

01:07:59.270 --> 01:08:00.620 line:90%
the cultural marketplace.

01:08:00.620 --> 01:08:07.970 line:84%
We can consume feminism in
magazines, Oprah, Ellen, Girls,

01:08:07.970 --> 01:08:11.655 line:84%
whatever list of things
you might want to pop onto

01:08:11.655 --> 01:08:14.240 line:84%
to say, yeah, look at--
there is some conversation

01:08:14.240 --> 01:08:16.819 line:90%
about feminism going on.

01:08:16.819 --> 01:08:20.840 line:84%
That is not the same beast
that Judy's talking about.

01:08:20.840 --> 01:08:24.600 line:84%
A lot is lost in
the translation.

01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:27.500 line:84%
But I do think it's important
to notice that it is there

01:08:27.500 --> 01:08:33.500 line:84%
as we can see feminist themed
cultural products everywhere

01:08:33.500 --> 01:08:34.109 line:90%
we go.

01:08:34.109 --> 01:08:37.880 line:84%
And I chalk that
up as a positive.

01:08:37.880 --> 01:08:41.149 line:84%
It might not be the feminism
you particularly want to see,

01:08:41.149 --> 01:08:44.569 line:84%
you might be able to list
all the failures of it.

01:08:44.569 --> 01:08:48.170 line:84%
But the fact it's there means
that people coming of age

01:08:48.170 --> 01:08:50.120 line:84%
are interacting with
it in a way that, I

01:08:50.120 --> 01:08:52.790 line:84%
know, it wasn't as available
when I was growing up

01:08:52.790 --> 01:08:57.529 line:84%
in the '70s, certainly not
when Judy was living her life.

01:08:57.529 --> 01:09:02.600 line:84%
So I think that's a success,
even if it's paradoxical.

01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:03.920 line:90%
Thank you, all.

01:09:03.920 --> 01:09:06.020 line:90%
