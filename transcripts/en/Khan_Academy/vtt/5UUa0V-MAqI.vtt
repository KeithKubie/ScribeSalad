00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:03.930
In my attempt to have a
portfolio whose performance

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:07.410
should depend only on my ability
to identify good companies,

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.620
and to identify bad companies,
and not be held sway

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:13.880
by whatever the
market might do, I

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:15.909
have bought a
share of company B,

00:00:15.909 --> 00:00:17.575
thinking that it's a
pretty good company

00:00:17.575 --> 00:00:19.680
and will do better
than expected.

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.007
And I have shorted two
shares of company A.

00:00:22.007 --> 00:00:24.090
And I've shorted two of
them, because they're only

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.420
at $5 a share, and I wanted to
short the same dollar amount.

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:31.430
So now I want to think about,
assuming that I was right,

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:33.980
that company B will do
better than company A

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.810
relative to each other, how my
investment will do if the stock

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:41.404
market moves up, or if the
stock market moves down.

00:00:41.404 --> 00:00:42.820
So let's imagine
a situation where

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:44.090
the stock market moves up.

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.950
In that situation, you could
imagine both of these stocks

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:47.850
will go up.

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.820
So let's say company B
goes up in percentage terms

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:58.450
more than company A. So let's
say that company B gets to $15.

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:00.740
So it gets to $15 a share.

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:03.180
So it is up 50%.

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.620
And let's say that company
A only goes up by 20%,

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.480
so it goes to $6 a share.

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.260
So in that situation,
what happened?

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.780
I clearly make a lot of money on
company B, on my long position,

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.390
when the stock market
goes up. $10 became $15.

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.040
So I made $5 there.

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.120
And I clearly lost money
on my short position,

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.470
because I sold it
at $5, and now I'm

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:40.640
going to have to
buy it back at $6

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.990
if I want to cover
my short position.

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.840
So this $10 position-- remember,
I have two shares of them--

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:52.640
are now worth $12, 2 times $6.

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.880
And since this is a short
position, I will lose $2.

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.160
But because the company that
I thought would do better

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.950
did do better, it
went up by 50%,

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.780
while this only went up by 20%
percent, I still make money.

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.922
I still make a $3 profit.

00:02:10.922 --> 00:02:13.130
Now let's think about what
happens if the whole stock

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.320
market goes down.

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:18.680
And I'm going to assume
that I'm good at picking

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:19.717
the right companies.

00:02:19.717 --> 00:02:21.550
So I'm going to assume
that my thesis holds,

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.370
that B does better
relative to A.

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.890
So let's say in this negative
scenario, B goes down by 20%.

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.180
So it gets to $8 a share.

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:46.359
So this is the market up, this
is the market up scenario.

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:48.150
Now let's imagine the
market down scenario.

00:02:52.090 --> 00:03:00.070
So now my position in
B goes from $10 $8.

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:06.340
So I lose $2 on
my long position.

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.850
But when the market
went down, I was right,

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:10.670
A is not that
great of a company.

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:11.890
So it goes down more.

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:16.290
Let's imagine that
it goes down by 50%.

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:26.830
So A goes down by 50% all
the way to $2.50 per share.

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:30.370
So my position in A, the
short position that was $10,

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:36.040
it is now a $5 short position,
two shares at $2.50 per share.

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.260
So this is a short position.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.430
I sold the stock, I
borrowed and sold it $10.

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:41.930
Now I can buy it back at $5.

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:47.750
I make $5 on the short position
when the market goes down.

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.470
So even though I lost some
money on my long position

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:53.350
when the market goes down,
I more than make up for it

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:54.800
on my short position.

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.720
So even in the down market,
assuming my stock picking

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:02.110
is good, I have still made $3.

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:05.200
And so what we've set up
here is a long short hedge.

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.020
And what's cool
about it is, it's

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:09.790
only dependent on the
investor's ability

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:12.960
to differentiate between
companies that are more or less

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:15.710
likely to do well relative
to other companies.

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:18.899
And it's not as dependent
on someone's ability

00:04:18.899 --> 00:04:22.310
to pick which direction the
market itself will be going.

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:24.819
And so when people talk
about long-short hedge funds,

00:04:24.819 --> 00:04:26.860
they're talking about
hedge funds are essentially

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:27.410
doing this.

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:31.030
They're trying to hedge
out the market risk.
