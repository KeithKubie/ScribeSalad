It's pretty easy to add
a <i>FloatingActionButton</i> in Flutter.

00:00:11.981 --> 00:00:14.652
Simply add the FAB into your scaffold.

00:00:15.312 --> 00:00:17.681
But, what if you have
a <i>BottomNavigationBar</i>,

00:00:17.681 --> 00:00:20.060
and you want to embed that FAB in it?

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:21.750
Well, Flutter has got you covered.

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.171
First, add a <i>BottomNavigationBar</i>
to your scaffold.

00:00:25.171 --> 00:00:29.551
Then, use <i>FloatingActionButtonLocation</i>
to embed the FAB.

00:00:29.551 --> 00:00:30.971
Want it in the center?

00:00:30.971 --> 00:00:33.951
Try changing <i>endDocked</i> to <i>centerDocked</i>.

00:00:33.951 --> 00:00:35.762
And there you have it.

00:00:35.762 --> 00:00:40.553
Your <i>FloatingActionButton</i> is now neatly
embedded in your <i>BottomNavigationBar</i>.

00:00:40.553 --> 00:00:43.872
