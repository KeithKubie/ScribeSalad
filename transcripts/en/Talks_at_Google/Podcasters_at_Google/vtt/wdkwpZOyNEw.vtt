00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.110
[JINGLE PLAYS]

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:10.250
SPEAKER: Please welcome,
from "Welcome to Night Vale,"

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.890
Cecil Baldwin.

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:13.746
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:19.900
CECIL BALDWIN: Hi everybody.

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.380
Welcome back from the weekend.

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:25.610
I want to say thank you so
much for the opportunity

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:27.225
to get to come and speak to you.

00:00:27.225 --> 00:00:29.890
This is such a cool thing.

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:30.920
You all have a cool job.

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:31.836
And I have a cool job.

00:00:31.836 --> 00:00:35.609
And I'm glad we get to
do that together today.

00:00:35.609 --> 00:00:37.900
I just want to give you like
a little bit of background

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:42.310
about who I am, and what I
do, and this crazy, crazy job

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:46.030
that I have somehow
found myself in.

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.990
My name is Cecil Baldwin,
and I am an actor.

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:55.060
I did mostly theater,
classical theater,

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:57.700
a little bit of voiceover
stuff here and there.

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:03.190
And then, in my late 20s, I got
in with this theater company

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:06.220
called the New
York Neo-Futurists.

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.080
The New York Neo-Futurists--

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.870
I went to school
out in the Midwest.

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:14.080
Their flagship show, "Too Much
Light Makes the Baby Go Blind"

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:19.240
had run for like 25
years in Chicago.

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.480
It was like the hallmark
of late night theater.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:27.190
Like, the more you drink, the
better we are kind of theater.

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:29.830
But it became this cult
phenomenon out in Chicago.

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.230
And then eventually some
people came to New York,

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:33.885
and they started the
New York company.

00:01:33.885 --> 00:01:35.385
I went to school
out in the Midwest.

00:01:35.385 --> 00:01:40.330
And so my college years
were filled with road

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:44.260
tripping up to Chicago and
seeing a normal play at eight,

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:49.941
and then go see "Too Much Light"
at 11:30, or whatever it is.

00:01:49.941 --> 00:01:51.940
Then eventually, when I
made my way to New York,

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:53.731
I found out oh, there's
a New York company.

00:01:53.731 --> 00:01:56.190
And I auditioned
and didn't get cast.

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:59.050
And then I auditioned
again and got cast.

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:01.240
But what's so funny
is that this theater

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.500
company the Neo-Futurists is
integral to the story of Night

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.090
Vale.

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:13.630
Because one of the writers
is a company member.

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:17.605
Joseph Fink, the guy whose
brainchild Night Vale is,

00:02:17.605 --> 00:02:20.500
is a huge fan of the show,
and saw "Too Much Light"

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.660
over and over and over again.

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.170
Then I got involved directly
because of "Too Much Light."

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.230
So the whole hallmark
of the Neo-Futurists

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.680
is you are who you are,
you are where you are,

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.990
and you are doing
what you're doing.

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:40.210
It was in reaction
to the improv comedy

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:44.490
scene of the '80s in Chicago.

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:46.690
It's like, OK, we'll
just improv a scene

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.900
where I'm the Queen of England
and you're William Shakespeare,

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.850
and we'll just see
where the funny is.

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:53.680
And the Neos wanted
to get rid of all that

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.420
and just be like, no I'm Cecil.

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.700
I'm always me.

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:58.960
I'm standing in this room.

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.070
We're in New York City.

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:01.300
I'm at the Google building.

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.820
Like these are the
given of the situation.

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:07.900
And let's start from there
and see what we can get into.

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.954
So how does all this
apply to "Night Vale?"

00:03:09.954 --> 00:03:11.620
If you've ever listened
to "Night Vale,"

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.490
you'll notice that
my character's name,

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:16.381
coincidentally enough, is Cecil.

00:03:16.381 --> 00:03:18.880
And it was one of those things
where, when we first started,

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.754
we're like, well, the
character needs a name.

00:03:20.754 --> 00:03:22.360
I guess we'll just
call it Cecil.

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:23.050
It's your name.

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:25.351
It's easy to remember, right?

00:03:25.351 --> 00:03:27.850
Little did we know that would
later cause some consternation

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:31.420
down the line.

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.870
Me, Joseph, Jeffery,
the two writers, myself.

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:38.380
We had this idea to--

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.630
Joseph loves podcasts.

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:43.330
And he was this
frustrated writer

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:48.570
trying to make it in the
writing, publishing world,

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:50.860
and was frustrated with the
amount of gatekeepers that

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:53.950
are necessary to get published.

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:55.540
He published his own book.

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.490
I think he used
software designed

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:00.310
for creating greeting
cards in order to do that,

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:02.860
but it's was just
what he had available.

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:06.370
And he was working selling
green energy on the street

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:09.140
and putting together his books.

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:10.450
But he loved podcasts.

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:12.730
And he thought, well
this is literally

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:17.290
the lowest gate-keeper to
get your stuff out there.

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:19.750
So he had this idea
of a small desert

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:23.200
town where every conspiracy
theory you've ever heard

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:27.270
is not only true, but it's
just a part of everyday life.

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.040
He got Jeffrey Cranor on board,
who is a Neo-Futurist as well.

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:34.840
And then, I was currently
doing a little short play

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.360
with the Neos about how,
ever since I was a kid,

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.615
I had this sort of
radio announcer voice.

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:50.500
And somehow, I had yet
to be on the radio.

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:54.120
So Joseph heard this,
and was like, well, I'm

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:59.230
making this project
that needs this guy who

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:03.070
is like a NPR, public
radio character.

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:04.430
And you'd be perfect for that.

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:09.460
But in the creepiest,
weirdest possible way.

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:10.381
I read the script.

00:05:10.381 --> 00:05:11.380
I read the pilot script.

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:12.760
And I absolutely loved it.

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:17.020
I'm a huge fan of David Lynch,
and David Cronenberg, and HP

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:21.150
Lovecraft, and all
these horror tropes

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:24.240
that were built into the
world of "Night Vale,"

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.880
but then takes them and
turns them on their head,

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:31.020
and then makes them interesting,
or abstract, or funny.

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:35.250
I immediately got
the tone right away.

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:36.990
We just started
making this thing.

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:40.852
I literally recorded it
in my apartment in Harlem.

00:05:40.852 --> 00:05:42.810
Would have to turn off
all the air conditioners

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:46.170
and shut everything down
and unplug the fridge so it

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:48.660
didn't make any noise.

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:50.400
I have to do take
after take after take,

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:53.370
because I'd be in the middle
of a dramatic monologue,

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:57.261
and then all of a sudden the
ice cream truck would roll by.

00:05:57.261 --> 00:06:00.240
There was an episode called
"Yellow Helicopters,"

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.400
and there were literally
helicopters circling

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:05.280
my apartment while I was
recording, which sounds cute,

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:07.380
until it's like hour
three, and you're like OK,

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:09.090
I just need to finish this.

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:11.640
I just need to finish
this one episode.

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:14.060
We just started
making this thing.

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:17.170
We had no idea
where it would go.

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:20.010
Then what was interesting
about this idea of going back

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:22.680
to these ideas of you are who
you are, you are where you are,

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:25.050
you're doing what you're doing--

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:28.170
I started incorporating
my own personality

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:29.640
into the performance.

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:31.590
I record by myself.

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:33.090
I'm kind of my own director.

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:35.770
So I do a take, and then
I go back and listen.

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:39.510
So I can use my actor brain,
finish that, and then go back

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:40.740
and use my director brain.

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:43.830
Because you can't do
both at the same time.

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:47.310
You can't do the thing and
also comment on the thing

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:48.960
while you're doing it.

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:52.500
You really have to
separate those out.

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:54.180
But as "Night Vale"
started to grow,

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:57.000
and as the plot
got more developed,

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.660
and as the world got more
developed, all of a sudden,

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:02.520
aspects of my own
personality started

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:06.540
to bleed into the
world of "Night Vale."

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:10.050
Early on, this character, Carlos
the scientist, was introduced.

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:12.900
And this character
was really just a foil

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:16.000
for the town of Night Vale.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.830
Night Vale's this crazy
place where pterodactyls

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:22.140
appear suddenly
in a PTA meeting,

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:24.630
and then disappear
just as suddenly.

00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:27.480
But from my point
of view as an actor,

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:31.830
trying to ground that in
a realistic, human place

00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:34.230
was the most important thing.

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:35.910
So this character,
Carlos the scientist,

00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:37.749
shows up, who's very normal.

00:07:37.749 --> 00:07:40.040
And he's like, you know, your
town is really messed up,

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:40.540
right?

00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:44.340
Let me explain to you all the
ways your town is messed up.

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:47.010
But he was described
as being this--

00:07:47.010 --> 00:07:51.660
gorgeous hair, and gorgeous
teeth, and really just

00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:53.000
shockingly beautiful.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.090
And so, the first time I read
that, my initial reaction is,

00:07:57.090 --> 00:08:01.200
OK, let's just say I live
in a town with 300 people,

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:04.590
and this beautiful
male model shows up.

00:08:04.590 --> 00:08:07.110
I'd at least be intrigued,
and at the very most,

00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:10.410
I'd be like, OK, this
guy's really cute.

00:08:10.410 --> 00:08:12.600
So I started putting
more of that energy

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:19.290
into my performance, in making
this relationship develop.

00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:21.750
Eventually, the writers
picked up on that.

00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:26.190
And all of a sudden, we had
this canon gay relationship

00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:29.610
at the heart of the show
that doesn't drive the show,

00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:33.240
but he is nevertheless
an important part

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:39.470
of my character, the voice
that talks to you all.

00:08:39.470 --> 00:08:41.640
Then over the
course of the show,

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:43.590
this Cecil and
Carlos relationship

00:08:43.590 --> 00:08:49.202
actually became one of the lynch
pins that led to our success.

00:08:49.202 --> 00:08:50.910
One of my favorite
things about the show,

00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:55.320
is that there are very
few physical character

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:56.430
descriptions.

00:08:56.430 --> 00:09:03.810
And this is really interesting
and very unusual these days.

00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:07.770
There's so many popular
novels and stories and things

00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:08.350
like that.

00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:10.433
And it's all about what
the characters are wearing

00:09:10.433 --> 00:09:16.210
and how they present themselves
to the outside world.

00:09:16.210 --> 00:09:21.300
But in Night Vale, you have
a lot of people's actions

00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:24.090
define who they are.

00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:26.040
This character is Tamika Flynn.

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:32.430
She is a young teenager who is
a militia leader, of course,

00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:35.670
and really, really loves
books and hates librarians.

00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:38.470
Now, this is classic
"Night Vale,"

00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:41.100
in that the mundane
becomes absurd,

00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:42.990
and the absurd becomes mundane.

00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:46.276
So something as usual
as a librarian--

00:09:46.276 --> 00:09:48.150
all of a sudden in the
world of "Night Vale,"

00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:51.660
librarians are these
mythical beasts

00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:55.890
that want nothing more than
to eat people that love books.

00:09:55.890 --> 00:09:57.420
This character,
Tamika Flynn, she's

00:09:57.420 --> 00:10:01.020
made it her job to protect
Night Vale from the librarians.

00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:04.290
But this incorporation
of people who

00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:07.080
are outside of the
normal of what you

00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:10.590
might see in everyday media--

00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:12.660
actually I was just
listening to the Google Talk

00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:14.700
with Aisha Tyler.

00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:18.870
What's so interesting is that,
this is 10 years ago or so,

00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:22.140
and here's this woman,
this black woman,

00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:25.890
who was literally the first
black person on "Friends."

00:10:25.890 --> 00:10:30.420
I think that set the tone for,
what is mainstream media doing,

00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:34.350
and how are they reflecting
the world that we live in?

00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:38.400
Being on the cult
end of things, where

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:39.930
we don't have
corporate sponsors,

00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:43.200
we don't have a team of people
looking over our demographics

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:45.810
and going, oh, well you know
if you write this person on--

00:10:45.810 --> 00:10:48.180
if you write a gay
character into the show,

00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:52.230
you'll get this demographic,
that demographic.

00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:54.300
What's great is
that we just do it.

00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:57.080
We just put it out
there and let it roll.

00:10:57.080 --> 00:11:02.820
Tamika is this strong,
feminist character,

00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:06.930
person of color who is
kicking ass and taking names.

00:11:06.930 --> 00:11:12.000
And that is-- the
color of her skin,

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.180
her sexuality, things like that,
are the least important thing

00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:18.240
about her, and yet,
they're still present.

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:19.920
And "Night Vale"
is rife with these.

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:22.390
They're all over the place.

00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:26.460
Of course, in "Night
Vale," angels exist.

00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:29.470
This is another representation
of my character, Cecil.

00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:31.095
As you can tell,
looks nothing like me.

00:11:31.095 --> 00:11:31.886
But, you know what?

00:11:31.886 --> 00:11:33.540
That's the joy of
doing a radio show,

00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:39.007
is that these characters really
exist in the listener's mind.

00:11:39.007 --> 00:11:41.340
When "Night Vale" first started
to become popular, there

00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:44.490
was a huge debate over,
what does Cecil look like?

00:11:44.490 --> 00:11:45.990
And I find this
really interesting,

00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:49.780
because people want to
be given the answers.

00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:53.060
They don't want to sit and think
and analyze for themselves.

00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:55.710
Or if they do, they
want the creators

00:11:55.710 --> 00:11:58.920
to step in and be like,
oh, you are correct.

00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:00.180
Yes, you are correct.

00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:01.710
Correct answer.

00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:05.610
And "Night Vale," the
answers aren't that easy.

00:12:05.610 --> 00:12:07.780
If you look up any
of the fan art,

00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:11.610
there is huge variations in
what this character, Cecil,

00:12:11.610 --> 00:12:12.150
looks like.

00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:14.990
And he's never actually
been described.

00:12:14.990 --> 00:12:19.710
And what's really fascinating,
is that they range everything

00:12:19.710 --> 00:12:23.100
from the sort of Tim
Gunn, blond, "Mad Men"

00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:26.310
looking person, to
a person of color,

00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:29.840
like Afro-Caribbbean-centric
clothing,

00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:35.620
to furry pants and crazy
fashion, to alien, to--

00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:38.100
there's a slug one.

00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:40.180
It really just runs the gamut.

00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:42.790
Whenever people ask me, they're
like, what Cecil look like?

00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:43.950
We need to know!

00:12:43.950 --> 00:12:46.350
And I'm like, well, what
do you think he looks like?

00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:48.090
That answer is correct.

00:12:48.090 --> 00:12:50.490
I think living in
that ambiguity is

00:12:50.490 --> 00:12:53.250
one of the most beautiful
things about "Night Vale."

00:12:53.250 --> 00:12:58.260
We live in this world now
where media is omnipresent.

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:00.450
I mean, you all work at
Google, you know this.

00:13:00.450 --> 00:13:01.410
It's everywhere.

00:13:01.410 --> 00:13:03.750
We have we have tiny
hand computers that live

00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:05.650
in our pockets all the time.

00:13:05.650 --> 00:13:08.910
And we have access to that
information all the time.

00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:11.500
And that is amazing.

00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:14.490
But at the same time, living
with a little bit of ambiguity

00:13:14.490 --> 00:13:16.650
in your life can
actually make things kind

00:13:16.650 --> 00:13:19.210
of fun and interesting.

00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:20.720
So we continue to
make "Night Vale."

00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:23.760
We got very, very
popular, very quick,

00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:29.040
through a mix of Twitter
and Tumblr and Reddit.

00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:31.860
There was like this
one perfect summer

00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:35.640
where "Hannibal" was on
hiatus, and "Pacific Rim"

00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:37.020
had just come out.

00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:41.760
And the nerds were
feeling really strong.

00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:44.280
All of a sudden, this
weird podcast that

00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:47.610
had a good amount of
listeners, but nothing crazy,

00:13:47.610 --> 00:13:50.790
all of a sudden literally
turned into the blueprint

00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:52.500
of what it means to go viral.

00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:59.770
The interconnectedness of
the world let this happen.

00:13:59.770 --> 00:14:03.720
So you have a fan of "Night
Vale" who lives in Australia.

00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:06.200
They tell 10 of their
friends about this podcast.

00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:08.930
And those 10 people tell
their friends, and et cetera,

00:14:08.930 --> 00:14:09.540
et cetera.

00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:11.850
But the difference
is, those people

00:14:11.850 --> 00:14:15.660
can live all over the world
and have a conversation just

00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:18.480
like we're having in this room.

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:20.400
Then it literally just
happened in one summer.

00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:22.510
I was visiting a friend.

00:14:22.510 --> 00:14:25.680
I'd been fired from my job
as a waiter, literally just

00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:28.095
around the corner
here on 10th Avenue.

00:14:28.095 --> 00:14:29.970
I think I had enough
money in my bank account

00:14:29.970 --> 00:14:31.919
to last three months.

00:14:31.919 --> 00:14:33.960
I was like, OK, I'm going
to have a great summer,

00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:36.210
and keep it low key.

00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:39.840
And then find another
waiter job, like you do.

00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:41.970
And then over the course
of that three months,

00:14:41.970 --> 00:14:43.800
"Night Vale" started
to become this thing.

00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:46.950
Our download numbers became
more and more and more.

00:14:46.950 --> 00:14:49.230
Then we surpassed
"This American Life"

00:14:49.230 --> 00:14:53.310
as the most downloaded
podcast in the world.

00:14:53.310 --> 00:14:57.040
Then we became the most
downloaded podcast in England,

00:14:57.040 --> 00:15:00.690
in Australia, et
cetera, et cetera.

00:15:00.690 --> 00:15:03.870
Me, Meg Bashwiner, Joseph
Fink, Jeffrey Cranor

00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:06.330
looked at each other and went,
I think there's something--

00:15:06.330 --> 00:15:09.060
there's a sea change happening,
and we could all feel it.

00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:11.490
But we didn't quite
know what it meant.

00:15:11.490 --> 00:15:13.920
So we just kept making the work.

00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:17.919
We just kept-- we have this
new episodes every two weeks.

00:15:17.919 --> 00:15:19.710
We've got to just keep
putting it out there

00:15:19.710 --> 00:15:23.490
and just let the noise happen,
and acknowledge it, but then

00:15:23.490 --> 00:15:26.070
just funnel everything
into the work.

00:15:26.070 --> 00:15:29.190
Then eventually, we did
our first live reading.

00:15:29.190 --> 00:15:32.880
And that was in San
Francisco, at a bookstore

00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:36.400
called The Booksmith in the
Haight-Ashbury district.

00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:38.120
We were like, oh,
it'll be great.

00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:39.870
Our friend Mara Wilson is there.

00:15:39.870 --> 00:15:42.030
And she is The
Faceless Old Woman Who

00:15:42.030 --> 00:15:43.330
Secretly Lives in Your Home.

00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:45.360
And she's visiting her friend.

00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:48.480
And we'll just have
a fun little reading.

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:52.590
We show up, and there's
hundreds of people there.

00:15:52.590 --> 00:15:55.920
It's one of those things
where, as an actor,

00:15:55.920 --> 00:16:00.630
when you get on stage, and you
expect to interact with people.

00:16:00.630 --> 00:16:04.090
But it's one thing to
interact with 10, 15,

00:16:04.090 --> 00:16:07.600
20 people, and then
interact with like 500.

00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:10.710
So this was very unexpected.

00:16:10.710 --> 00:16:12.630
Eventually, we stopped
pinching ourselves.

00:16:12.630 --> 00:16:14.130
Then we're just
like, you know what?

00:16:14.130 --> 00:16:16.505
This is just like doing "Too
Much Light Makes the Baby Go

00:16:16.505 --> 00:16:19.680
Blind" in the East Village
at 11 o'clock at night.

00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:24.750
You just talk to the people,
do the thing, make the art.

00:16:24.750 --> 00:16:25.650
That's your job.

00:16:25.650 --> 00:16:29.190
It doesn't matter who's in the
audience or how many people.

00:16:29.190 --> 00:16:30.900
Eventually it did
start to snowball.

00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:33.060
And we were like, OK.

00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:34.830
We're theater
writers and actors.

00:16:34.830 --> 00:16:37.860
Let's see if we can put
together a live show.

00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:41.640
That started us on the next part
of the journey of "Night Vale,"

00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:44.220
which is getting
off of the podcast

00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:48.300
and then getting it
into the live shows.

00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:51.840
We've done live shows all
over the world at this point.

00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:53.640
We've performed in churches.

00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:55.700
We've performed in rock clubs.

00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:59.580
We've performed
in concert halls.

00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:02.670
We've performed in theater
theaters, in movie theaters.

00:17:02.670 --> 00:17:04.619
We've run the gamut.

00:17:04.619 --> 00:17:08.819
Because it all started off as
this very cottage industry.

00:17:08.819 --> 00:17:11.339
Literally Jeffrey Cranor
calling up universities

00:17:11.339 --> 00:17:15.119
and being like, hey, can we
rent out your lecture hall

00:17:15.119 --> 00:17:16.020
to do this show?

00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:19.770
And they'd be like, no one's
going to come see this!

00:17:19.770 --> 00:17:21.329
Yeah, sure whatever.

00:17:21.329 --> 00:17:23.880
And we would do the show,
and then hundreds of people

00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:24.903
would show up.

00:17:24.903 --> 00:17:26.819
These people were just
like, what is going on?

00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:32.010
We've had to learn
a lot about this.

00:17:32.010 --> 00:17:33.960
And I think this is a
really interesting model

00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:38.070
for a lot of businesses that are
happening right now, where you

00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:39.960
do this thing that you love.

00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:41.310
And then you keep doing it.

00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:42.930
And you do it
because you love it.

00:17:42.930 --> 00:17:44.680
And you put it out
there, because you want

00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:46.170
to share it with the world.

00:17:46.170 --> 00:17:50.250
And then eventually, other
people who love this thing also

00:17:50.250 --> 00:17:50.801
find it.

00:17:50.801 --> 00:17:52.800
And then they tell their
friends, and et cetera,

00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:53.710
et cetera, et cetera.

00:17:53.710 --> 00:17:59.910
But all the stuff that comes
with that is the tricky part.

00:17:59.910 --> 00:18:03.060
We're theater actors,
theater writers.

00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:07.590
None of us had ever put
together a concert film

00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:15.029
or had to deal with writers with
agents and things like that.

00:18:15.029 --> 00:18:16.070
This was all kind of new.

00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:18.810
So our learning
curve was very steep.

00:18:18.810 --> 00:18:21.360
We found ourselves reaching
out to other people

00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:24.690
in the podcast community who
were a little bit farther along

00:18:24.690 --> 00:18:25.300
than us.

00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:27.990
And that has been invaluable.

00:18:27.990 --> 00:18:31.590
This is actually from one
of our first live shows.

00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:33.810
That's me in the
middle, Mara Wilson

00:18:33.810 --> 00:18:37.320
is right above me, who's
this amazing actor, very

00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:41.970
famous as a child actor, but now
is a writer, a serious writer,

00:18:41.970 --> 00:18:45.340
and Twitter personality.

00:18:45.340 --> 00:18:47.790
Next to her is
Jackson Publick, who

00:18:47.790 --> 00:18:52.320
is the voice of and creator
of Venture Brothers.

00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:54.540
Next to me is Marc
Jackson, who is literally

00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:58.230
one of the best improv
people in the world.

00:18:58.230 --> 00:19:00.840
You've seen him in a million
TV shows and movies and things

00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:02.130
like that.

00:19:02.130 --> 00:19:03.630
And then down in
the corner, I think

00:19:03.630 --> 00:19:06.090
that's Mark Gagliardi,
who is someone

00:19:06.090 --> 00:19:09.750
who I know from growing up, who
is also an improv sketch comedy

00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:11.160
person.

00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:15.810
Marc and-- Marc and Mark worked
for "The Thrilling Adventure

00:19:15.810 --> 00:19:20.010
Hour," which is this
long-standing, old school

00:19:20.010 --> 00:19:22.140
Hollywood radio show.

00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:24.360
Very, very funny,
very sketch-oriented.

00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:26.730
And they have this huge
roster of celebrities

00:19:26.730 --> 00:19:29.460
that would be on their show,
because it's just so much fun.

00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:32.340
But the "Thrilling Adventure
Hour" team reached out to us,

00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:35.670
and was like, hey, this is
how we do our live shows.

00:19:35.670 --> 00:19:37.110
Take what you want.

00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:39.030
Listen, we have all
these people in LA,

00:19:39.030 --> 00:19:42.060
if you ever want funny
actors to come on your show.

00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:43.680
And we're like, yes we will.

00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:47.220
Absolutely So we just asked
them to come on the show.

00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:49.980
And all of a sudden, we
went from doing readings

00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:52.740
in bookstores, with
just one or two people.

00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:57.840
Joseph's in the back playing
know music off of his iPod.

00:19:57.840 --> 00:20:00.270
Then all of a sudden,
we have multiple mics.

00:20:00.270 --> 00:20:02.430
And now we're doing staging.

00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:04.380
And where's the green room?

00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:07.320
Is there a bathroom
in the green room?

00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:10.550
What do we do with 12 actors
while they're waiting offstage?

00:20:10.550 --> 00:20:11.670
Everybody has to eat.

00:20:11.670 --> 00:20:12.990
Who's ordered pizza?

00:20:12.990 --> 00:20:15.270
All these logistical questions
that you don't really

00:20:15.270 --> 00:20:18.020
think of when you're just
doing it for the fun of it

00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:20.567
all of a sudden start
to come into play.

00:20:20.567 --> 00:20:21.650
It was a really fun night.

00:20:21.650 --> 00:20:23.180
We did two shows that night.

00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:26.190
And the show was, I don't
know, like two hours long.

00:20:26.190 --> 00:20:28.970
You imagine four hours
of standing onstage

00:20:28.970 --> 00:20:31.370
telling a story.

00:20:31.370 --> 00:20:34.770
When you're on stage,
time gets kind of weird.

00:20:34.770 --> 00:20:36.500
It can either like
feel like forever,

00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:38.796
or it can be the
blink of an eye.

00:20:38.796 --> 00:20:40.670
That night was definitely
one of those nights

00:20:40.670 --> 00:20:43.970
where it was 8 o'clock, and
then all of a sudden I blinked,

00:20:43.970 --> 00:20:45.200
and it's 1:00 in the morning.

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:47.324
And I was like, I don't
know where that night went.

00:20:47.324 --> 00:20:49.040
But it was a lot of fun.

00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:50.720
This is a more recent picture.

00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:54.770
This is Dylan Marron
as Carlos and myself,

00:20:54.770 --> 00:20:59.720
going back to this idea that
this gay canonical relationship

00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:01.970
is at the heart of the show.

00:21:01.970 --> 00:21:06.440
Dylan is one of the
kindest, funniest, smartest

00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:09.530
actors I've ever had the
pleasure of working with.

00:21:09.530 --> 00:21:12.860
And this sort of relationship at
the heart of the show, I think,

00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:17.360
was kind of a lynch pin for
the popularity of "Night Vale."

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:21.710
Because it was something that,
no matter where in the world

00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:25.850
you lived, you have your
physical community-- the people

00:21:25.850 --> 00:21:28.340
that you see everyday, in
your school, your family,

00:21:28.340 --> 00:21:29.360
things like that.

00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:31.193
Those are the people
that you interact with.

00:21:31.193 --> 00:21:33.680
But then you also have
your chosen community,

00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:35.870
which for a lot
of people online,

00:21:35.870 --> 00:21:38.450
that can be a way for
gay people to connect

00:21:38.450 --> 00:21:41.020
with other gay people,
for vegetarians

00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:42.680
to connect with
other vegetarians,

00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:46.850
whatever it is that you define
your community as being.

00:21:46.850 --> 00:21:51.050
I think having this
transparent and very real,

00:21:51.050 --> 00:21:53.300
honest look at a
gay relationship

00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:57.470
opened a lot of people's eyes
to what a gay relationship is.

00:21:57.470 --> 00:21:58.370
And you know what?

00:21:58.370 --> 00:22:01.640
It's pretty much the same
as a straight relationship.

00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:06.260
"Night Vale" made its
point on focusing on,

00:22:06.260 --> 00:22:07.670
who's going to do the dishes?

00:22:07.670 --> 00:22:09.320
Who's going to cook
dinner that night?

00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:14.700
It's the mundane stuff that
makes people's minds change.

00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:17.540
Because you're a listener
and you're like, oh, well,

00:22:17.540 --> 00:22:21.140
I'm not gay, but this sounds
exactly like my relationship.

00:22:21.140 --> 00:22:23.840
And incorporating that into
the show has done nothing

00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:25.580
but make it--

00:22:25.580 --> 00:22:28.610
bringing allies on and
changing people's minds.

00:22:28.610 --> 00:22:31.760
So there is this social
justice warrior aspect

00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:36.650
of the show, that is
not only unapologetic,

00:22:36.650 --> 00:22:38.870
but is also kind of necessary.

00:22:38.870 --> 00:22:40.490
And especially in
the last few years,

00:22:40.490 --> 00:22:44.070
it's been really,
really beneficial.

00:22:44.070 --> 00:22:44.997
So let's see.

00:22:44.997 --> 00:22:47.330
Like I said, we've had some
really amazing times getting

00:22:47.330 --> 00:22:49.490
to tour all over the world.

00:22:49.490 --> 00:22:54.310
This was-- Wil Wheaton is
a character on our show.

00:22:54.310 --> 00:22:56.060
What's interesting
about doing a show that

00:22:56.060 --> 00:22:59.240
is ongoing, and
episodic, and epic

00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:05.030
is that you always get a chance
to change things as you go.

00:23:05.030 --> 00:23:08.870
So the characters in episode
10 are not the same characters

00:23:08.870 --> 00:23:10.790
that are in episode 100.

00:23:10.790 --> 00:23:14.720
A lot of back story
has been drawn out.

00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:19.190
Because two weeks, you've
got to feed the podcast.

00:23:19.190 --> 00:23:21.660
You know the podcasts
will keep on coming out.

00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:23.990
So it gives you a
chance to world build.

00:23:23.990 --> 00:23:26.120
And it gives you chances
to go off on tangents

00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:29.360
and explore little cul-de-sacs,
and then maybe get back

00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:32.330
to the main plot, and then
go off on another tangent.

00:23:32.330 --> 00:23:34.610
And this episode
is just a monologue

00:23:34.610 --> 00:23:37.730
from a totally different
character, and that's OK.

00:23:37.730 --> 00:23:39.560
Because again, you're the boss.

00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:41.430
When you're creating
this-- when you're

00:23:41.430 --> 00:23:44.702
sort of the creator of
something like this,

00:23:44.702 --> 00:23:46.160
you don't have
anyone to answer to.

00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:49.550
You can follow those things
that you find interesting.

00:23:49.550 --> 00:23:53.180
Chances are your audience will
find them interesting as well.

00:23:53.180 --> 00:23:56.810
Wil's character was really
interesting, because it was--

00:23:56.810 --> 00:23:59.060
I want to say he started
off as just a one-off joke,

00:23:59.060 --> 00:24:02.810
where he was a childhood
friend of Cecil's.

00:24:02.810 --> 00:24:05.720
Then there was possibly
some romantic interest.

00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:09.560
But it was very subtext,
sub-sub-subtext.

00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:12.350
And then the internet
exploded, and they were like,

00:24:12.350 --> 00:24:15.780
don't you mess with Carlos!

00:24:15.780 --> 00:24:17.680
Who is this interloper
trying to horn

00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:20.390
in our favorite
gay relationship?

00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:23.150
The writers, being who
they are, they're like, OK,

00:24:23.150 --> 00:24:25.070
I see what the audience thinks.

00:24:25.070 --> 00:24:27.530
We're going to go the
totally opposite direction.

00:24:27.530 --> 00:24:30.200
He becomes this childhood
friend of Cecil,

00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:33.170
who just builds back story.

00:24:33.170 --> 00:24:36.680
And Wil's character is a
chef at a very trendy, trendy

00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:39.130
restaurant in Night
Vale called Tourniquet.

00:24:39.130 --> 00:24:40.630
And he's always
coming onto the show

00:24:40.630 --> 00:24:43.580
and doing cooking
segments that are just

00:24:43.580 --> 00:24:47.270
the most horrific things you've
ever heard in your entire life.

00:24:47.270 --> 00:24:49.190
Wil is the nicest person.

00:24:49.190 --> 00:24:51.530
He's so down to earth.

00:24:51.530 --> 00:24:55.310
Again, it's like he
got the sense of humor,

00:24:55.310 --> 00:24:57.590
being one of these
king of the nerds

00:24:57.590 --> 00:25:00.470
that are out there in the world.

00:25:00.470 --> 00:25:03.110
It made it really
interesting, because not

00:25:03.110 --> 00:25:08.240
only is that relationship
between creator and listener,

00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:10.024
it's reflexive.

00:25:10.024 --> 00:25:12.440
We make something, and then
we send it out into the world,

00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:14.210
and the world reacts to it.

00:25:14.210 --> 00:25:16.880
And then we react
to that reaction.

00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:19.120
Again, one of the reasons
why technology can really

00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:22.990
help, because all of a
sudden, that is instantaneous.

00:25:22.990 --> 00:25:26.320
Then I think Wil's
character is a definite--

00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:28.720
it shows how that can
flourish and progress.

00:25:32.110 --> 00:25:34.230
This is Joseph Fink
the middle, the creator

00:25:34.230 --> 00:25:35.230
"Welcome to Night Vale."

00:25:35.230 --> 00:25:37.660
Symphony Sanders,
who's a dear friend

00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:40.580
of mine, who voices
Tamika Flynn.

00:25:40.580 --> 00:25:44.060
And then Erin McKeown
down on the side there.

00:25:44.060 --> 00:25:46.060
One of the interesting
things about "Night Vale"

00:25:46.060 --> 00:25:48.910
is that every episode
includes a song

00:25:48.910 --> 00:25:52.750
by an independent
musical artist.

00:25:52.750 --> 00:25:59.800
These range from hip hop
to folk to pop to anything,

00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:04.480
as long as it falls squarely
in the musicians just trying

00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:05.770
to get their work out there.

00:26:05.770 --> 00:26:08.170
Erin McKeown is this
amazing musician,

00:26:08.170 --> 00:26:14.710
who is an Ani DiFranco
protege back in the day,

00:26:14.710 --> 00:26:18.880
and then has just continued to
make her own music for years.

00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:21.580
We found her, we snatched her
up, because she's awesome.

00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:23.500
She makes great music.

00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:25.300
She's a lot of
fun to tour with--

00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:28.750
very important-- and also
brings a really great energy

00:26:28.750 --> 00:26:30.627
to the show.

00:26:30.627 --> 00:26:31.210
It's so funny.

00:26:31.210 --> 00:26:35.050
When you are at work,
the people around you

00:26:35.050 --> 00:26:38.260
really define the
quality of the work.

00:26:38.260 --> 00:26:40.930
You want to find people
that challenge you,

00:26:40.930 --> 00:26:45.400
that support you, and also
help you think differently

00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:49.300
than you already think, but
also know how you think.

00:26:49.300 --> 00:26:53.562
So that way, somebody gives
you an idea, and you're like,

00:26:53.562 --> 00:26:56.020
I never in a million years
would I have thought about that.

00:26:56.020 --> 00:26:57.170
But I love it.

00:26:57.170 --> 00:27:00.130
And now, here's what
I can add to it.

00:27:00.130 --> 00:27:02.440
The relationship between
the writers and myself,

00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:05.140
the other actors that
appear on the show,

00:27:05.140 --> 00:27:08.626
we all have this sort
of working relationship.

00:27:08.626 --> 00:27:10.000
It's really great,
because we get

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:14.680
to go and do this show live in
front of hundreds of people.

00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:16.660
Every night is a
little bit different,

00:27:16.660 --> 00:27:18.700
because that's live theater.

00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:22.870
Symphony and I are constantly
refining and working

00:27:22.870 --> 00:27:24.430
on the comedy of the show.

00:27:24.430 --> 00:27:26.800
And you're like, OK, this
joke didn't work tonight.

00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:27.991
Maybe if we try it this way?

00:27:27.991 --> 00:27:28.490
OK.

00:27:28.490 --> 00:27:29.739
It worked a little bit better.

00:27:29.739 --> 00:27:31.270
OK, let's try adding this.

00:27:31.270 --> 00:27:32.530
Let's try doing this.

00:27:32.530 --> 00:27:36.220
So every night is a little
bit of an experiment.

00:27:36.220 --> 00:27:39.760
Again, going back to this idea
of a little bit of ambiguity

00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:41.800
is actually OK.

00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:44.950
A little bit of an
experiment is OK.

00:27:44.950 --> 00:27:46.880
You get out there, you
know the work is solid.

00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:48.820
You know what you're doing.

00:27:48.820 --> 00:27:51.340
But around the
periphery, you can also

00:27:51.340 --> 00:27:53.800
play around a little bit.

00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:55.600
Sometimes that's
where the magic lives.

00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:59.260
Because you'll find things
that your conscious brain never

00:27:59.260 --> 00:28:01.190
in a million years
would have thought of.

00:28:01.190 --> 00:28:03.460
But all of a sudden,
when you're live in front

00:28:03.460 --> 00:28:06.940
of a group of people, and you do
something-- you react honestly.

00:28:06.940 --> 00:28:10.300
You look at a person
in the eye, and you

00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:13.690
react using the language
that you've been given,

00:28:13.690 --> 00:28:17.350
all of a sudden, magic happens.

00:28:17.350 --> 00:28:19.180
This is Jon Bernstein, a.k.a.

00:28:19.180 --> 00:28:23.620
Disparition, who has also been
in on the show "Night Vale"

00:28:23.620 --> 00:28:25.270
since the ground floor.

00:28:25.270 --> 00:28:27.400
Joseph knew Jon from
way back in the day.

00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:30.990
I think he worked at Something
Awful, if you remember that.

00:28:30.990 --> 00:28:32.980
They worked there together.

00:28:32.980 --> 00:28:34.600
Jon is this brilliant
musician who

00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:38.870
makes the most beautiful
ambient music you've ever heard.

00:28:38.870 --> 00:28:41.140
He had just a whole
canon of music

00:28:41.140 --> 00:28:43.360
that he put out into
the internet for free.

00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:46.060
Joseph said hey, do you mind
if I use some of your music

00:28:46.060 --> 00:28:48.730
as background for "Night Vale."

00:28:48.730 --> 00:28:50.080
And Jon was like, yeah, sure.

00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:52.330
It's just sitting there.

00:28:52.330 --> 00:28:54.610
So we started incorporating
his music into the show.

00:28:54.610 --> 00:28:57.070
And then eventually, once
the show started taking off,

00:28:57.070 --> 00:29:00.400
Jon started writing
specifically for "Night Vale."

00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:03.880
Now he tours with us,
and he plays live.

00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:06.670
He live underscores
the entire show.

00:29:06.670 --> 00:29:07.900
He plays mandolin.

00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:10.120
He has a keyboard.

00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:13.480
He has all the tech wizardry
that happens over here

00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:17.650
in the corner while I'm
talking into a microphone.

00:29:17.650 --> 00:29:20.920
What's great about this
is, it just incorporates

00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:24.160
another layer of
look-- here are people,

00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:25.880
here are a group
of artists, actors,

00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:29.410
writers musicians, who are
doing what they love to do.

00:29:29.410 --> 00:29:32.650
And you love to
watch them do it.

00:29:32.650 --> 00:29:34.510
And we're going
to sit in a room.

00:29:34.510 --> 00:29:37.630
It's the simplest, oldest
formula in the world--

00:29:37.630 --> 00:29:40.870
storytellers telling a story,
musicians playing music,

00:29:40.870 --> 00:29:42.100
and people listening.

00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:43.150
That's all you need.

00:29:43.150 --> 00:29:45.460
When I was back
in theater school,

00:29:45.460 --> 00:29:48.090
a teacher asked us
to define theater.

00:29:48.090 --> 00:29:51.137
And we're like, oh,
it's got to be Broadway,

00:29:51.137 --> 00:29:51.970
it's got to be this.

00:29:51.970 --> 00:29:54.050
She was like, no, think simpler.

00:29:54.050 --> 00:29:58.670
Eventually we got it down
to a performs b for c.

00:29:58.670 --> 00:29:59.420
That's it.

00:29:59.420 --> 00:30:01.630
That's the only
formula that you need

00:30:01.630 --> 00:30:03.340
for theater and storytelling.

00:30:03.340 --> 00:30:06.550
You need people to perform, you
need what they're performing,

00:30:06.550 --> 00:30:09.250
and you need someone to listen.

00:30:09.250 --> 00:30:13.540
So we've created this
theater troupe, essentially,

00:30:13.540 --> 00:30:15.340
like a theater troupe
in the older sense,

00:30:15.340 --> 00:30:18.190
like the Elizabethan sense.

00:30:18.190 --> 00:30:23.680
We act, we set up, we
do our own green room,

00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:25.240
we drive from place to place.

00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:29.230
We handle not only the artistic
side, but also the business

00:30:29.230 --> 00:30:31.360
side of stuff as well.

00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:34.840
I find that that's getting
rarer and rarer these days,

00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:36.820
because it's a lot of work.

00:30:36.820 --> 00:30:39.580
It requires a lot of
attention to detail.

00:30:39.580 --> 00:30:43.524
And it involves expanding
your skill set all the time

00:30:43.524 --> 00:30:45.190
to incorporate things
that you might not

00:30:45.190 --> 00:30:47.560
be totally comfortable with.

00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:48.560
But, you know what?

00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:51.730
There's nothing better
than learning on your feet.

00:30:51.730 --> 00:30:53.530
This is one of my
favorite venues.

00:30:53.530 --> 00:30:55.090
It's in Vancouver.

00:30:55.090 --> 00:30:57.370
This was the end of
one of the last tours.

00:30:57.370 --> 00:30:59.830
You imagine going from doing
a reading in a bookstore,

00:30:59.830 --> 00:31:04.660
and then we're performing
in places like this, two,

00:31:04.660 --> 00:31:06.250
three years later.

00:31:06.250 --> 00:31:08.560
We've sold out this--

00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:11.980
we've done almost sold out shows
in this theater, this venue,

00:31:11.980 --> 00:31:14.320
I think three times now.

00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:16.300
It's the most beautiful
theater in the world.

00:31:16.300 --> 00:31:18.460
It's acoustically perfect.

00:31:18.460 --> 00:31:20.120
No microphones necessary.

00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:23.260
It's one of my favorite
places to play.

00:31:23.260 --> 00:31:25.300
And it's also just
this gorgeous--

00:31:25.300 --> 00:31:26.440
Vancouver is amazing.

00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:29.722
So it's always fun
to have a stop there.

00:31:29.722 --> 00:31:31.180
This is another
one of those venues

00:31:31.180 --> 00:31:32.920
that we just had
to pinch ourselves

00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:34.045
that we were performing at.

00:31:34.045 --> 00:31:36.040
So this is The
Palladium in London.

00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:40.300
This is the equivalent of going
to the Nederlander Theater

00:31:40.300 --> 00:31:41.710
on Broadway.

00:31:41.710 --> 00:31:44.980
It's this huge venue.

00:31:44.980 --> 00:31:47.740
It's owned by
Andrew Lloyd Webber.

00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:50.560
You walk outside, and you're
in the middle of the heart

00:31:50.560 --> 00:31:52.180
of Oxford, in London.

00:31:54.809 --> 00:31:56.600
Me and my friends were
just like, I can't--

00:31:56.600 --> 00:31:58.310
what-- what did we do?

00:31:58.310 --> 00:31:59.990
How did we end up here?

00:31:59.990 --> 00:32:03.370
We're wandering around, silently
walking through the crowd

00:32:03.370 --> 00:32:05.950
outside waiting to
get into the show.

00:32:05.950 --> 00:32:07.840
And most people
don't recognize us

00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:10.900
when we're just average
everyday people.

00:32:10.900 --> 00:32:12.890
And also London is
filled with people.

00:32:12.890 --> 00:32:13.710
So you can't really take it in.

00:32:13.710 --> 00:32:15.709
But we were just like,
look at all these people!

00:32:15.709 --> 00:32:17.470
They're here for us.

00:32:17.470 --> 00:32:18.550
Can you believe this?

00:32:18.550 --> 00:32:20.550
This is crazy!

00:32:20.550 --> 00:32:23.350
The energy before that show
was absolutely unbelievable,

00:32:23.350 --> 00:32:25.580
because we're in
a foreign country.

00:32:25.580 --> 00:32:27.290
We're outside of
our comfort zone.

00:32:27.290 --> 00:32:28.750
We're outside of our home.

00:32:28.750 --> 00:32:32.830
And yet, we still feel like we
are at home, because we're just

00:32:32.830 --> 00:32:34.240
doing what we love to do.

00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:38.680
It's the same show that we had
done 50, 60, 70 times before.

00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:40.870
And so there's a level
of comfort-ability.

00:32:40.870 --> 00:32:43.270
But the electricity in
the room was amazing,

00:32:43.270 --> 00:32:45.910
because this is
2,400 people, which

00:32:45.910 --> 00:32:48.310
I think was the largest
show "Night Vale" had ever

00:32:48.310 --> 00:32:50.170
done to date.

00:32:50.170 --> 00:32:53.800
And then this is what I
look like after the show.

00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:56.830
So "Night Vale" has
been this blessing.

00:32:56.830 --> 00:33:00.670
It has been this very,
very strange journey, one

00:33:00.670 --> 00:33:03.430
that I'm still on, that
allows me to come to Google,

00:33:03.430 --> 00:33:05.080
and to say yes, I'm
going to stand up

00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:09.010
in front of a room of people
and tell you my story.

00:33:09.010 --> 00:33:10.780
And hopefully there's
something that you

00:33:10.780 --> 00:33:13.000
can take away from that.

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:16.630
If anything, I think the
blessing of "Night Vale"

00:33:16.630 --> 00:33:20.140
is just keep doing
what you're doing.

00:33:20.140 --> 00:33:23.080
Keep making the work.

00:33:23.080 --> 00:33:26.200
When I had been fired from that
restaurant, five years ago,

00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:29.507
six years ago, and I had no
idea what I was going to do,

00:33:29.507 --> 00:33:31.590
and I had no idea where
the money would come from,

00:33:31.590 --> 00:33:33.970
the only thing that
was never in doubt

00:33:33.970 --> 00:33:36.094
was, I'm not going to quit.

00:33:36.094 --> 00:33:38.510
I'm not going to drop out and
just be like, you know what?

00:33:38.510 --> 00:33:39.100
Screw it.

00:33:39.100 --> 00:33:40.150
I'm done.

00:33:40.150 --> 00:33:41.590
I've had enough.

00:33:41.590 --> 00:33:45.670
You have to keep making the
work that you love to do,

00:33:45.670 --> 00:33:48.850
and then eventually that
will blossom into something

00:33:48.850 --> 00:33:51.260
that other people
will pay you to do,

00:33:51.260 --> 00:33:53.320
that will allow you
to live your life

00:33:53.320 --> 00:33:55.390
and then focus on that work.

00:33:55.390 --> 00:33:58.210
Then once that happens, the
groundwork is already set,

00:33:58.210 --> 00:34:02.060
and you are in the mindset to
be like, no, this is my job.

00:34:02.060 --> 00:34:04.600
This is what I love.

00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:06.370
I would say that--
to anyone who moves

00:34:06.370 --> 00:34:12.190
New York City to work in the
arts, work in anything, really.

00:34:12.190 --> 00:34:14.320
You work all day
to make your rent.

00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:16.330
Then at the end of
your day you go home,

00:34:16.330 --> 00:34:17.967
and that's when the
real work begins.

00:34:17.967 --> 00:34:20.050
That's when you start to
work on the projects that

00:34:20.050 --> 00:34:24.070
really like feed your
soul, that give you life.

00:34:24.070 --> 00:34:26.170
Then if you're lucky,
and if you persist,

00:34:26.170 --> 00:34:28.840
then those projects
eventually become

00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:30.969
the job that pay your rent.

00:34:30.969 --> 00:34:34.179
Then all of a sudden,
you marry those two.

00:34:34.179 --> 00:34:37.420
That's what New
York was made for.

00:34:37.420 --> 00:34:38.719
I love what I do.

00:34:38.719 --> 00:34:39.489
I love it so much.

00:34:39.489 --> 00:34:42.370
And I love to be able to
get to talk to people.

00:34:42.370 --> 00:34:45.050
And I welcome the chance to
answer any questions you have.

00:34:45.050 --> 00:34:46.187
Thank you.

00:34:46.187 --> 00:34:49.151
[APPLAUSE]

00:34:52.929 --> 00:34:54.980
Let's find a good
background slide.

00:34:54.980 --> 00:34:55.480
There we go.

00:34:55.480 --> 00:34:55.980
All right.

00:34:57.940 --> 00:35:00.440
SPEAKER: We do encourage you
guys to think of your questions

00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:02.780
and to make your way to
the microphone for that.

00:35:02.780 --> 00:35:04.790
We definitely want to
hear from all of you.

00:35:04.790 --> 00:35:08.540
I do have a couple to get
us started, if that's OK.

00:35:08.540 --> 00:35:13.950
I wanted to talk first about
the horror element in the show.

00:35:13.950 --> 00:35:16.860
I know you spent a great deal of
time talking about the comedy.

00:35:16.860 --> 00:35:18.860
But I wanted to reference
the horror part of it.

00:35:18.860 --> 00:35:23.030
Because it very much is a
horror story, or at least taking

00:35:23.030 --> 00:35:25.140
place in a horror setting.

00:35:25.140 --> 00:35:27.070
But it's not a
contemporary horror.

00:35:27.070 --> 00:35:28.790
It's not gory in any way.

00:35:28.790 --> 00:35:30.830
It's not really filled
with jump scares.

00:35:30.830 --> 00:35:32.330
So I was wondering
if you could talk

00:35:32.330 --> 00:35:34.146
about the influence
of the horror

00:35:34.146 --> 00:35:35.270
background and the setting.

00:35:35.270 --> 00:35:36.487
CECIL BALDWIN: Sure.

00:35:36.487 --> 00:35:38.570
It was definitely present
from the very beginning,

00:35:38.570 --> 00:35:39.710
like that pilot episode.

00:35:39.710 --> 00:35:42.980
And I think one of
the reasons that I

00:35:42.980 --> 00:35:45.530
was so fortunate to become
part of this project

00:35:45.530 --> 00:35:47.600
is because I knew the guys.

00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:49.370
I knew their voice.

00:35:49.370 --> 00:35:50.480
I'd heard their writing.

00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:52.950
And I'd heard them
speak their own writing.

00:35:52.950 --> 00:35:57.980
And so I knew what was funny
and also what was scary.

00:35:57.980 --> 00:36:00.080
Let's say if they had
just had an audition,

00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:02.390
and put it out in
"Backstage," being like,

00:36:02.390 --> 00:36:03.720
oh, we need a voiceover actor.

00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:06.440
I don't think
another actor would

00:36:06.440 --> 00:36:11.089
have gotten to that humor
or that horror as quickly.

00:36:11.089 --> 00:36:13.130
Because I read that pilot
script, and I was like,

00:36:13.130 --> 00:36:14.600
oh, it's "Twin Peaks."

00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:17.240
Oh, it's "Blue Velvet."

00:36:17.240 --> 00:36:22.580
OK, great, I know how something
that's very simple and mundane

00:36:22.580 --> 00:36:26.230
can become very
scary and unnerving.

00:36:26.230 --> 00:36:29.270
Have you all seen "Blue Velvet?"

00:36:29.270 --> 00:36:31.940
Kyle MacLachlan's character,
in the first 10 minutes,

00:36:31.940 --> 00:36:37.310
finds an ear, like
just out in the grass.

00:36:37.310 --> 00:36:40.370
It's the idea of something
very normal, something

00:36:40.370 --> 00:36:42.110
very simple that
we see every day,

00:36:42.110 --> 00:36:43.820
literally thousands
of times a day,

00:36:43.820 --> 00:36:47.870
but taken out of its context
can become terrifying.

00:36:47.870 --> 00:36:49.850
And I think a lot of the
horror of "Night Vale"

00:36:49.850 --> 00:36:53.060
is really based on that.

00:36:53.060 --> 00:36:55.550
Something like finding
a cassette tape

00:36:55.550 --> 00:36:58.040
that you made when
you were a teenager,

00:36:58.040 --> 00:37:00.380
and reveling in that
nostalgia of like,

00:37:00.380 --> 00:37:03.710
oh, listen to how cute I
was, little teenage me!

00:37:03.710 --> 00:37:07.700
But then at the end of that
cassette tape, you die.

00:37:07.700 --> 00:37:11.730
And you don't know what
killed you or what happened.

00:37:11.730 --> 00:37:14.300
But you're definitely here now.

00:37:14.300 --> 00:37:15.480
And this is real.

00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:16.620
And I feel real.

00:37:16.620 --> 00:37:18.950
And it's all those
questions in that.

00:37:18.950 --> 00:37:22.190
I think that's where the
scariness of "Night Vale"

00:37:22.190 --> 00:37:27.277
lies, is in that
unexplained phenomena.

00:37:27.277 --> 00:37:27.860
SPEAKER: Sure.

00:37:27.860 --> 00:37:30.560
The unexplained is a
really key element.

00:37:30.560 --> 00:37:32.210
And I think you
guys do that a lot,

00:37:32.210 --> 00:37:33.590
with a lot of the characters.

00:37:33.590 --> 00:37:36.260
Like you were saying,
leaving out detail

00:37:36.260 --> 00:37:38.300
to allow that to be filled in.

00:37:38.300 --> 00:37:41.540
It works in a very "Twilight
Zone," "Outer Limits"

00:37:41.540 --> 00:37:42.720
kind of way.

00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:45.350
There's clearly
something going on,

00:37:45.350 --> 00:37:48.380
CECIL BALDWIN: But nobody
can put their finger on it.

00:37:48.380 --> 00:37:52.280
SPEAKER: Are there plans
to start explaining--

00:37:52.280 --> 00:37:53.030
CECIL BALDWIN: No.

00:37:53.030 --> 00:37:53.950
Why would there?

00:37:53.950 --> 00:37:54.530
[LAUGHING]

00:37:54.530 --> 00:37:57.071
What's interesting is that the
way "Night Vale" is structured

00:37:57.071 --> 00:38:01.880
is that, because it was very
home grown in the beginning,

00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:05.300
it wasn't until episode 10 or 15
that we're like, whoa, whoa, we

00:38:05.300 --> 00:38:08.060
should probably start recording
and keeping track of some

00:38:08.060 --> 00:38:13.579
of these characters, and what
they do and what they've done.

00:38:13.579 --> 00:38:15.620
What's interesting about
doing this episodic show

00:38:15.620 --> 00:38:20.330
is that a joke, literally a one
sentence joke from episode 3,

00:38:20.330 --> 00:38:23.060
all of a sudden can turn
into an entire plot line that

00:38:23.060 --> 00:38:26.510
takes over an entire season.

00:38:26.510 --> 00:38:30.260
That is our way of going
back and explaining things.

00:38:30.260 --> 00:38:32.870
Simple characters like
Wil Wheaton's character

00:38:32.870 --> 00:38:38.000
is a good example, where it
was just a little one-off joke.

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:39.620
Cecil was in Boy
Scouts, and he was

00:38:39.620 --> 00:38:41.180
in Boy Scouts with this guy.

00:38:41.180 --> 00:38:42.920
And then all of a
sudden, that goes off

00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:45.560
in a totally
different tangent that

00:38:45.560 --> 00:38:48.350
now is taken that
character relationship

00:38:48.350 --> 00:38:50.430
to a different place.

00:38:50.430 --> 00:38:53.690
I think what's
interesting is that there

00:38:53.690 --> 00:38:55.985
are these sort of
demigods in "Night

00:38:55.985 --> 00:39:01.190
Vale," these strange,
unexplained, powerful

00:39:01.190 --> 00:39:01.900
creatures.

00:39:01.900 --> 00:39:04.400
And I think, if
anything, "Night Vale"

00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:07.020
will probably start filling
in the gaps in some of those.

00:39:07.020 --> 00:39:08.728
SPEAKER: And some of
that eldritch horror

00:39:08.728 --> 00:39:09.770
has to have day jobs.

00:39:09.770 --> 00:39:12.186
CECIL BALDWIN: Because what
makes the eldritch abomination

00:39:12.186 --> 00:39:15.360
so terrifying is that
it is indescribable.

00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:16.130
SPEAKER: Right.

00:39:16.130 --> 00:39:18.171
CECIL BALDWIN: And when
you start to describe it,

00:39:18.171 --> 00:39:20.390
your brain scrambles,
and people go mad.

00:39:20.390 --> 00:39:25.900
The un-know-edness of that
is what makes it scary.

00:39:25.900 --> 00:39:28.010
I would say the
scariest thing is

00:39:28.010 --> 00:39:34.970
what lies just beyond the
circle of light from a campfire.

00:39:34.970 --> 00:39:36.680
Going back to that
idea of, if I was

00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:41.030
to describe to you every aspect
of the mad man that has escaped

00:39:41.030 --> 00:39:43.850
from the insane asylum
that's out there in the woods

00:39:43.850 --> 00:39:48.170
somewhere, I'm feeding
you that information.

00:39:48.170 --> 00:39:49.800
I'm giving it you,
so that way you

00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:51.050
don't have to do the work of--

00:39:51.050 --> 00:39:52.230
what is this person?

00:39:52.230 --> 00:39:53.510
What is he--

00:39:53.510 --> 00:39:57.980
It's much more terrifying to
imagine that for yourself,

00:39:57.980 --> 00:40:02.120
to not know, and to live
in that not knowing.

00:40:02.120 --> 00:40:04.500
That's so much scarier.

00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:07.190
SPEAKER: The unknown, or the
things that are foreign to us

00:40:07.190 --> 00:40:09.530
are typically the
scariest things.

00:40:09.530 --> 00:40:11.660
Which leads me to
another interesting point

00:40:11.660 --> 00:40:15.600
that I want to talk
about, which is the--

00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:18.140
you touched a lot on
the relationship that's

00:40:18.140 --> 00:40:19.280
at the core of the story.

00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:24.140
And it's not really heavy
handed, like you've explained,

00:40:24.140 --> 00:40:31.195
but it's led you to a lot of
activism in that LGBTQ space.

00:40:31.195 --> 00:40:32.070
Discuss those things.

00:40:32.070 --> 00:40:34.820
How do you use the
vehicle of the show

00:40:34.820 --> 00:40:38.870
and just the normalcy of
it to then turn to advocacy

00:40:38.870 --> 00:40:40.670
when you're outside the space.

00:40:40.670 --> 00:40:41.503
CECIL BALDWIN: Sure.

00:40:41.503 --> 00:40:43.250
What's interesting
is, that "Night Vale,"

00:40:43.250 --> 00:40:48.400
for all of its craziness
and scariness, is pretty PG.

00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:51.310
Crazy, terrible things
happen, don't get me wrong,

00:40:51.310 --> 00:40:58.070
but it's still kind of
a family friendly show

00:40:58.070 --> 00:40:59.300
in a weird sort of way.

00:40:59.300 --> 00:41:01.310
And it's very inclusive.

00:41:01.310 --> 00:41:07.410
I find that when I meet people,
fans, at live shows and online

00:41:07.410 --> 00:41:09.230
and things like
that, oftentimes it's

00:41:09.230 --> 00:41:12.920
multiple generations of people
that have discovered the show.

00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:18.470
Because there is this
LGBT aspect to it--

00:41:18.470 --> 00:41:21.410
my character and Dylan's
character, Carlos.

00:41:21.410 --> 00:41:29.760
The angels are non-gendered
beings, et cetera, et cetera.

00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:32.210
It's really interesting,
because a lot of young fans

00:41:32.210 --> 00:41:36.470
get into the show, and then
use "Night Vale" as a gateway

00:41:36.470 --> 00:41:41.390
to talk to their parents, or
their friends, or coworkers,

00:41:41.390 --> 00:41:44.030
or whatever on who they are.

00:41:44.030 --> 00:41:46.394
They've been like, OK,
look, I know I'm 14

00:41:46.394 --> 00:41:47.810
and I just came
out of the closet.

00:41:47.810 --> 00:41:49.268
And I have no idea
what's happening

00:41:49.268 --> 00:41:51.050
to my emotions or my body.

00:41:51.050 --> 00:41:53.990
And I have to process
all this information

00:41:53.990 --> 00:41:57.830
and talk to my parents about it.

00:41:57.830 --> 00:41:58.700
Here, mom, dad.

00:41:58.700 --> 00:42:02.600
Here is a podcast
that represents how

00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:06.320
I feel about this whole thing.

00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:10.610
It's kind of strange, in that
it is such a bizarre show.

00:42:10.610 --> 00:42:14.810
But it is so based in
normal human relationships.

00:42:14.810 --> 00:42:17.050
I think that's what
makes it so relatable.

00:42:17.050 --> 00:42:19.130
SPEAKER: Normalization
is huge, I think,

00:42:19.130 --> 00:42:21.560
in all forms of
advocacy, anytime.

00:42:21.560 --> 00:42:24.710
Because it's that unfamiliarity
that makes it scary,

00:42:24.710 --> 00:42:25.970
or the misinformation.

00:42:25.970 --> 00:42:27.760
So I love that element of it.

00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:29.394
We've got a couple questions.

00:42:29.394 --> 00:42:30.560
AUDIENCE: Thanks for coming.

00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:31.601
CECIL BALDWIN: Thank you.

00:42:31.601 --> 00:42:34.700
AUDIENCE: You have these
amazing live shows that you do.

00:42:34.700 --> 00:42:37.040
Now that the show is
as popular as it is,

00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:41.390
do you write and craft and
rehearse privately, and then

00:42:41.390 --> 00:42:45.470
workshop it live, and then
go record it for the public?

00:42:45.470 --> 00:42:48.290
Because you said you do 40,
50, 60 sometimes performances.

00:42:48.290 --> 00:42:52.110
And you find these moments
live, in true theater.

00:42:52.110 --> 00:42:54.590
Does the episode recording
come first, and then

00:42:54.590 --> 00:42:55.940
live, or vice versa?

00:42:55.940 --> 00:43:00.740
CECIL BALDWIN: The live show
is separate from the podcast.

00:43:00.740 --> 00:43:03.470
You know the podcast comes
out once every two weeks.

00:43:03.470 --> 00:43:06.267
The boys write an episode.

00:43:06.267 --> 00:43:07.100
They sign off on it.

00:43:07.100 --> 00:43:08.180
They send it to me.

00:43:08.180 --> 00:43:11.240
I record it at home,
send it back to them,

00:43:11.240 --> 00:43:12.830
and they put it up online.

00:43:12.830 --> 00:43:18.620
The live shows were made to be
separate for a couple reasons.

00:43:18.620 --> 00:43:21.260
It acknowledges the fact that
everyone's in the same room,

00:43:21.260 --> 00:43:23.750
probably is the most
fundamental thing.

00:43:23.750 --> 00:43:25.760
Again, back to this idea
of you are who you are,

00:43:25.760 --> 00:43:28.010
you are where you are, you're
doing what you're doing.

00:43:28.010 --> 00:43:32.390
If you're live on stage,
you can't deny that.

00:43:32.390 --> 00:43:35.840
We have played around
with a lot of ideas of,

00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:37.700
oh, you're listening
to a radio show,

00:43:37.700 --> 00:43:40.760
but we all know you're really
in a theater in Vancouver

00:43:40.760 --> 00:43:43.050
on a Tuesday night.

00:43:43.050 --> 00:43:45.710
It also allows
people who are not

00:43:45.710 --> 00:43:50.270
super-fans of the podcast
to walk in and get

00:43:50.270 --> 00:43:52.190
what's going on.

00:43:52.190 --> 00:43:54.740
The story of the live
shows-- every year

00:43:54.740 --> 00:43:56.120
we do a different script.

00:43:56.120 --> 00:43:58.360
And we run that show for a year.

00:43:58.360 --> 00:44:00.890
We try to tour to as
many places as possible

00:44:00.890 --> 00:44:03.530
and get that live
script to them.

00:44:03.530 --> 00:44:05.540
Then we finish it,
we're like, great.

00:44:05.540 --> 00:44:08.090
Then we release that online.

00:44:08.090 --> 00:44:12.740
Jon Bernstein, he records
pretty much every live show

00:44:12.740 --> 00:44:13.970
that we do.

00:44:13.970 --> 00:44:15.950
Then at the end of
that yearly cycle,

00:44:15.950 --> 00:44:20.390
he'll take his favorite moments,
each section by section,

00:44:20.390 --> 00:44:21.110
and then find--

00:44:21.110 --> 00:44:25.130
OK, well, we had Desiree
Burch was in Germany

00:44:25.130 --> 00:44:27.680
for this one show in Cologne.

00:44:27.680 --> 00:44:30.632
And that was the best me
and Desiree have ever done.

00:44:30.632 --> 00:44:32.090
We're going to take
that recording,

00:44:32.090 --> 00:44:35.409
and then put that together
with Geoffrey did a monologue.

00:44:35.409 --> 00:44:36.200
It's his character.

00:44:36.200 --> 00:44:38.090
And [? Philly ?] nailed it.

00:44:38.090 --> 00:44:40.380
So we're going to like
cobble that together.

00:44:40.380 --> 00:44:42.320
And then that's what we release.

00:44:42.320 --> 00:44:46.670
I think we do a suggested
donation on Bandcamp of $1.

00:44:46.670 --> 00:44:48.920
So it's really more
about make the work,

00:44:48.920 --> 00:44:55.100
get it out there, rather than
let's commodify this to death.

00:44:55.100 --> 00:44:57.280
What's great about
that is, when you

00:44:57.280 --> 00:45:00.460
are in this mindset of
work, work, work, work.

00:45:00.460 --> 00:45:02.830
Just get out there
and do the thing.

00:45:02.830 --> 00:45:06.880
It allows for these
unexpected moments to pop up.

00:45:06.880 --> 00:45:08.290
We don't do improv.

00:45:08.290 --> 00:45:08.950
It's a script.

00:45:08.950 --> 00:45:09.850
It's all scripted.

00:45:09.850 --> 00:45:12.850
Joseph and Jeffrey have written
the live performance script.

00:45:12.850 --> 00:45:16.840
But what you can't
control in the moment

00:45:16.840 --> 00:45:18.610
is audience reactions.

00:45:18.610 --> 00:45:20.740
It's what you ate for
dinner that night.

00:45:20.740 --> 00:45:23.470
It's all these human
elements that become

00:45:23.470 --> 00:45:26.050
the sort of mystery factor.

00:45:26.050 --> 00:45:27.730
All of a sudden,
Symphony Sanders

00:45:27.730 --> 00:45:31.930
will say something
that just cracks me up.

00:45:31.930 --> 00:45:34.630
You can either deny that moment
and pretend like it never

00:45:34.630 --> 00:45:39.670
happened, which a lot of
mainstream theater is built on.

00:45:39.670 --> 00:45:43.930
Or you can allow it to happen,
acknowledge it, and then

00:45:43.930 --> 00:45:46.090
incorporate it into
the performance.

00:45:46.090 --> 00:45:48.730
And if it's something
that's truly amazing

00:45:48.730 --> 00:45:50.320
you do it again the next night.

00:45:50.320 --> 00:45:54.640
But the trick is, you can't
recreate that mystery factor.

00:45:54.640 --> 00:45:58.090
It has to be real and organic.

00:45:58.090 --> 00:45:59.650
Or you go, you know what?

00:45:59.650 --> 00:46:01.420
That was hilarious.

00:46:01.420 --> 00:46:02.920
Tomorrow night it
won't be there,

00:46:02.920 --> 00:46:04.490
because it won't feel real.

00:46:04.490 --> 00:46:07.930
So you're riding that line
between doing the best

00:46:07.930 --> 00:46:10.030
show possible,
sticking to the script,

00:46:10.030 --> 00:46:14.270
but then also being open
to external stimulus

00:46:14.270 --> 00:46:16.247
and the truth of the moment.

00:46:16.247 --> 00:46:17.080
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:46:17.080 --> 00:46:18.760
CECIL BALDWIN: Yeah.

00:46:18.760 --> 00:46:20.890
SPEAKER: Please, go ahead.

00:46:20.890 --> 00:46:21.640
CECIL BALDWIN: Hi.

00:46:21.640 --> 00:46:23.223
AUDIENCE: So awesome
to have you here.

00:46:23.223 --> 00:46:24.430
CECIL BALDWIN: Oh, thanks.

00:46:24.430 --> 00:46:28.210
AUDIENCE: You said that you
act as your own director

00:46:28.210 --> 00:46:29.680
when you're recording.

00:46:29.680 --> 00:46:34.000
But a lot of the
tone of "Night Vale"

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:36.820
comes from the
specificity of your voice

00:46:36.820 --> 00:46:39.760
and the way you say things.

00:46:39.760 --> 00:46:42.790
I was wondering
how much of this is

00:46:42.790 --> 00:46:45.350
stage directions in the
script, and how much of it

00:46:45.350 --> 00:46:46.150
it's just you.

00:46:46.150 --> 00:46:46.900
CECIL BALDWIN: OK.

00:46:46.900 --> 00:46:48.566
That's a that's a
really great question,

00:46:48.566 --> 00:46:52.240
because what's interesting
is there's no stage

00:46:52.240 --> 00:46:53.980
directions in the script.

00:46:53.980 --> 00:46:56.440
It is really-- there's
two books out now

00:46:56.440 --> 00:46:59.720
that are the first year and
the second year of "Night

00:46:59.720 --> 00:47:00.580
Vale" scripts.

00:47:00.580 --> 00:47:05.410
And if you look at those,
maybe there's a door slam,

00:47:05.410 --> 00:47:09.130
maybe there's shuffling papers.

00:47:09.130 --> 00:47:10.420
But that's it.

00:47:10.420 --> 00:47:13.690
Everything else is
just words on a page.

00:47:13.690 --> 00:47:16.600
My background-- I did a lot of
classical theater in my 20s,

00:47:16.600 --> 00:47:19.600
like a lot of Shakespeare,
Moliere, things like that.

00:47:19.600 --> 00:47:22.930
What's great about
that training is

00:47:22.930 --> 00:47:26.040
that's exactly how
Shakespeare worked.

00:47:26.040 --> 00:47:28.750
The Elizabethans would
go listen to a play.

00:47:28.750 --> 00:47:31.870
They wouldn't go to
watch a play, kind

00:47:31.870 --> 00:47:35.380
of what we think about now.

00:47:35.380 --> 00:47:37.510
The actors would
take this poetry.

00:47:37.510 --> 00:47:42.060
And there'd be very little
visual element, kind of basic.

00:47:42.060 --> 00:47:44.910
It was performed outside,
under full sunlight.

00:47:44.910 --> 00:47:48.130
There's people selling
oranges, and prostitutes,

00:47:48.130 --> 00:47:52.240
and shady business deals,
and highbrow and lowbrow

00:47:52.240 --> 00:47:53.340
and everything in between.

00:47:53.340 --> 00:47:55.300
It was this carnival atmosphere.

00:47:55.300 --> 00:47:56.594
But a play was going on.

00:47:56.594 --> 00:47:58.510
Some of the most beautiful
poetry in the world

00:47:58.510 --> 00:48:00.370
was being spoken.

00:48:00.370 --> 00:48:03.670
The Elizabethans could
pick up on that poetry,

00:48:03.670 --> 00:48:07.790
because they tuned in
their ears to listen to it.

00:48:07.790 --> 00:48:10.660
So I find when I'm at
home in my living room,

00:48:10.660 --> 00:48:15.040
recording an episode,
I approach the language

00:48:15.040 --> 00:48:18.310
of "Night Vale" with the
same reverence as I would,

00:48:18.310 --> 00:48:19.810
"To be or not to be."

00:48:19.810 --> 00:48:21.670
Because that's all you have.

00:48:21.670 --> 00:48:24.414
Like right now, I'm
sitting in front of you.

00:48:24.414 --> 00:48:25.580
We're looking at each other.

00:48:25.580 --> 00:48:29.500
I'm using my hands
to emphasize a point.

00:48:29.500 --> 00:48:31.660
We have these
secondary gestures,

00:48:31.660 --> 00:48:34.240
secondary communication.

00:48:34.240 --> 00:48:37.420
All that is taken away
when you do a radio show.

00:48:37.420 --> 00:48:40.330
You have to take
all of that and then

00:48:40.330 --> 00:48:43.920
focus it just on the words.

00:48:43.920 --> 00:48:46.840
I find that's the biggest trick.

00:48:46.840 --> 00:48:49.124
There are times when
I'll record a segment,

00:48:49.124 --> 00:48:50.290
and I'll go back and listen.

00:48:50.290 --> 00:48:52.630
I'm like, oh, it
sounds a little flat.

00:48:52.630 --> 00:48:56.320
Not because the writing
is flat or the performance

00:48:56.320 --> 00:48:59.410
is flat, just because it's
not heightened enough.

00:48:59.410 --> 00:49:01.870
It's not intense enough.

00:49:01.870 --> 00:49:06.700
You have to overshoot
the mark with intensity,

00:49:06.700 --> 00:49:09.190
especially when there's
no visual element to it.

00:49:09.190 --> 00:49:13.000
And you're talking about
crazy things happening.

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:15.310
There's a woman who's
visiting our town.

00:49:15.310 --> 00:49:17.260
And she's taking
over people's brains

00:49:17.260 --> 00:49:20.980
and making them say poetry
in a rhythmic chant.

00:49:20.980 --> 00:49:23.570
You can't go too far.

00:49:23.570 --> 00:49:26.980
Oftentimes the ideas that
I have in the moment that

00:49:26.980 --> 00:49:29.500
are like, why did this
character sound like this?

00:49:29.500 --> 00:49:30.430
I don't know.

00:49:30.430 --> 00:49:32.620
It sounded interesting
at the time.

00:49:32.620 --> 00:49:34.120
Those were the most--

00:49:34.120 --> 00:49:36.005
those are the longest
lasting ideas.

00:49:36.005 --> 00:49:37.630
Because you're just
like, I don't know.

00:49:37.630 --> 00:49:41.500
I followed this down this rabbit
hole, and that's where we are.

00:49:41.500 --> 00:49:44.050
Those are often the characters
that people really love.

00:49:44.050 --> 00:49:47.530
SPEAKER: Have you ever had
that go counter to what

00:49:47.530 --> 00:49:49.450
the guys' writing to
where they were like,

00:49:49.450 --> 00:49:51.170
oh, this was meant
to be a laugh line.

00:49:51.170 --> 00:49:52.820
CECIL BALDWIN: Oh, absolutely.

00:49:52.820 --> 00:49:56.120
There was one
character, Leanne Hart.

00:49:56.120 --> 00:49:58.280
She's a blogger, I believe?

00:49:58.280 --> 00:50:02.390
No, she is a local
newspaper editor.

00:50:02.390 --> 00:50:07.250
And her thing is that
she hates bloggers.

00:50:07.250 --> 00:50:09.950
And she wants to kill
them all with an axe.

00:50:09.950 --> 00:50:12.194
That's her thing.

00:50:12.194 --> 00:50:14.360
Again, like a one-off
character, and then eventually

00:50:14.360 --> 00:50:17.150
she got an episode where
she was very present.

00:50:17.150 --> 00:50:19.070
And she speaks.

00:50:19.070 --> 00:50:22.610
I was like, well, she seems
to be kind of unhinged.

00:50:22.610 --> 00:50:26.240
She gets more and more unhinged
as the episode goes on.

00:50:26.240 --> 00:50:28.670
What started off as a very
normal sounding character

00:50:28.670 --> 00:50:32.450
all of a sudden
turned into the Joker

00:50:32.450 --> 00:50:34.340
from Batman by the end of it.

00:50:37.640 --> 00:50:39.230
She gets crazy.

00:50:39.230 --> 00:50:40.190
I recorded the episode.

00:50:40.190 --> 00:50:41.990
I sent it off to
Joseph and Jeffrey.

00:50:41.990 --> 00:50:44.400
They were like, OK, yeah.

00:50:44.400 --> 00:50:47.810
Leanne is actually a character
in like some upcoming episodes,

00:50:47.810 --> 00:50:53.000
and she can't be
totally batshit insane.

00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:53.950
Pull it back a little.

00:50:53.950 --> 00:50:55.630
And I was like, great.

00:50:55.630 --> 00:50:56.810
That I can do.

00:50:56.810 --> 00:50:58.610
One of the easiest
things in the world

00:50:58.610 --> 00:51:00.830
is to dial something down.

00:51:00.830 --> 00:51:04.730
It's much harder to
increase it in intensity.

00:51:04.730 --> 00:51:08.080
I find, start at 10, and
then start pulling it down,

00:51:08.080 --> 00:51:10.500
so you hit that sweet spot.

00:51:10.500 --> 00:51:11.170
SPEAKER: Nice.

00:51:11.170 --> 00:51:11.670
Please.

00:51:11.670 --> 00:51:14.322
CECIL BALDWIN: Yeah, thanks.

00:51:14.322 --> 00:51:15.320
AUDIENCE: Hey.

00:51:15.320 --> 00:51:19.520
One of the most interesting
things to me about "Night Vale"

00:51:19.520 --> 00:51:27.740
is how it does work to normalize
a vast swath of humanity.

00:51:27.740 --> 00:51:29.540
And it does it through horror.

00:51:29.540 --> 00:51:31.580
A lot of times in
horror, the other

00:51:31.580 --> 00:51:35.600
is used as something
to fear, something

00:51:35.600 --> 00:51:39.860
to project everything
evil against.

00:51:39.860 --> 00:51:43.610
Whereas in "Night Vale," to
accept the premise of the show,

00:51:43.610 --> 00:51:49.850
you have to understand that a
severed hand from a Russian man

00:51:49.850 --> 00:51:50.669
is a teenage girl.

00:51:50.669 --> 00:51:51.710
CECIL BALDWIN: Absolutely

00:51:51.710 --> 00:51:55.250
AUDIENCE: Or that there are
literally five-headed dragons

00:51:55.250 --> 00:51:55.790
around.

00:51:55.790 --> 00:51:58.745
CECIL BALDWIN: And they're going
to run for a mayoral office.

00:51:58.745 --> 00:52:00.800
Because what else would they do?

00:52:00.800 --> 00:52:03.680
AUDIENCE: So could you talk
a little bit about that?

00:52:03.680 --> 00:52:06.464
Like how you turn horror around?

00:52:06.464 --> 00:52:07.880
CECIL BALDWIN:
Well I think what's

00:52:07.880 --> 00:52:10.110
interesting about "Night
Vale" is that, at its heart,

00:52:10.110 --> 00:52:12.170
it is about community.

00:52:12.170 --> 00:52:17.810
It's about this American town.

00:52:17.810 --> 00:52:20.180
What I love about Joseph and
Jeffrey's writing is that,

00:52:20.180 --> 00:52:26.930
it's not writing America as
it is perceived by itself.

00:52:26.930 --> 00:52:32.090
Things on TV, you think
about the nuclear family

00:52:32.090 --> 00:52:34.730
sitcom and what that is.

00:52:34.730 --> 00:52:35.630
Is that real?

00:52:35.630 --> 00:52:37.250
Is that how we see ourselves?

00:52:37.250 --> 00:52:40.550
Or is that how a certain
section of the population

00:52:40.550 --> 00:52:41.534
want to see ourselves?

00:52:41.534 --> 00:52:42.950
And I think Joseph
and Jeffrey are

00:52:42.950 --> 00:52:48.200
much better at incorporating
everybody into this community.

00:52:48.200 --> 00:52:51.890
So then it becomes
the horror of what

00:52:51.890 --> 00:52:54.830
lies outside that community.

00:52:54.830 --> 00:52:59.150
Cecil, at his heart, loves
the town of "Night Vale."

00:52:59.150 --> 00:53:03.950
And everyone in that
community is beloved by him.

00:53:03.950 --> 00:53:07.250
Because he sees the
importance of this

00:53:07.250 --> 00:53:10.790
interconnectedness of these
communities that we live in.

00:53:10.790 --> 00:53:13.970
So then the scary stuff
comes from outside of that.

00:53:13.970 --> 00:53:17.990
If you notice, a lot of the--
to borrow the Buffy term,

00:53:17.990 --> 00:53:22.640
the "big bad," every
season has the big bad.

00:53:22.640 --> 00:53:25.040
It's an outside
corporation, or it's

00:53:25.040 --> 00:53:29.150
an outside town that is trying
to take over "Night Vale."

00:53:29.150 --> 00:53:33.620
It is someone who
accidentally summons

00:53:33.620 --> 00:53:35.445
the devil in the form of--

00:53:38.225 --> 00:53:39.230
it goes on.

00:53:39.230 --> 00:53:42.080
Always the big bad is
always an outside thing

00:53:42.080 --> 00:53:46.040
that is attacking the fabric
of what "Night Vale" is,

00:53:46.040 --> 00:53:53.750
which is this accepting
community that

00:53:53.750 --> 00:53:54.830
supports each other.

00:53:54.830 --> 00:53:57.260
Even when you can't stand
each other, you still know.

00:53:57.260 --> 00:53:59.060
You're like, yes, this
is my step-brother.

00:53:59.060 --> 00:54:00.380
His name is Steve Carlsberg.

00:54:00.380 --> 00:54:01.760
And I hate him.

00:54:01.760 --> 00:54:03.060
But he's still my step-brother.

00:54:03.060 --> 00:54:04.730
And so I love him.

00:54:04.730 --> 00:54:08.150
And it's playing with
that relationship.

00:54:08.150 --> 00:54:11.840
The people in "Night Vale" very
rarely are the scary thing.

00:54:11.840 --> 00:54:15.740
It's always something
that's invading that.

00:54:15.740 --> 00:54:18.380
And I think that does
a lot to remind people

00:54:18.380 --> 00:54:22.790
that no matter where
you're at in your life,

00:54:22.790 --> 00:54:25.820
the outside world is terrifying.

00:54:25.820 --> 00:54:28.430
Literally pick up the news
and just look at Twitter,

00:54:28.430 --> 00:54:32.030
and just be like, OK, what am I
going to be terrified of today?

00:54:32.030 --> 00:54:34.340
But eventually you're
going to get through it.

00:54:34.340 --> 00:54:36.140
That's the takeaway
of "Night Vale."

00:54:36.140 --> 00:54:39.704
The scarier it gets, the
more hopeful it gets.

00:54:39.704 --> 00:54:41.120
Because at the end
of the episode,

00:54:41.120 --> 00:54:45.470
Cecil doesn't know where the
next episode is going to be,

00:54:45.470 --> 00:54:47.450
what's going to happen tomorrow.

00:54:47.450 --> 00:54:51.030
But he's like, no, all I know
is that this community has

00:54:51.030 --> 00:54:51.790
my back.

00:54:51.790 --> 00:54:54.760
And I am the voice
of this community.

00:54:54.760 --> 00:54:57.120
And we move on from there.

00:54:57.120 --> 00:54:58.060
SPEAKER: That's great.

00:54:58.060 --> 00:55:01.280
They're all the frogs
in the boiling water.

00:55:01.280 --> 00:55:03.655
So the glass of room temperature
tap water is terrifying.

00:55:03.655 --> 00:55:04.488
CECIL BALDWIN: Yeah.

00:55:04.488 --> 00:55:05.440
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

00:55:05.440 --> 00:55:08.470
They're like, well, we've
gotten used to this now.

00:55:08.470 --> 00:55:09.885
SPEAKER: Go ahead.

00:55:09.885 --> 00:55:11.260
AUDIENCE: What's
the one question

00:55:11.260 --> 00:55:13.993
you wish someone had
asked you, but never has.

00:55:13.993 --> 00:55:16.540
CECIL BALDWIN: Oh, man.

00:55:16.540 --> 00:55:20.320
The one question I wish
somebody would ask me?

00:55:20.320 --> 00:55:23.130
I don't know.

00:55:23.130 --> 00:55:26.710
I always love the question,
what is your dream project?

00:55:26.710 --> 00:55:29.730
It's very-- I don't think
anybody has ever asked me that.

00:55:29.730 --> 00:55:31.870
And it seems very staple of--

00:55:31.870 --> 00:55:35.031
if you could do anything,
what would you do?

00:55:35.031 --> 00:55:35.530
Yeah.

00:55:35.530 --> 00:55:37.470
I think that's it.

00:55:37.470 --> 00:55:40.104
SPEAKER 1: OK, now actually
answer the question.

00:55:40.104 --> 00:55:41.770
CECIL BALDWIN: As a
fan of horror movies

00:55:41.770 --> 00:55:44.880
and Shakespeare and all
these disparate things--

00:55:44.880 --> 00:55:47.400
has anybody ever seen this
movie, "Theater of Blood."

00:55:47.400 --> 00:55:49.090
Do you know this movie at all?

00:55:49.090 --> 00:55:52.630
It's like super campy
Vincent Price, Diana Rigg

00:55:52.630 --> 00:55:57.670
movie, in which Vincent Price
plays a Shakespearean actor who

00:55:57.670 --> 00:56:02.860
fakes his own death, goes crazy,
develops a theater company made

00:56:02.860 --> 00:56:06.010
of homeless people,
and then exacts revenge

00:56:06.010 --> 00:56:08.200
on all the critics
that panned him

00:56:08.200 --> 00:56:10.380
when he was a legit
Shakespeare actor,

00:56:10.380 --> 00:56:12.760
and kills them in ways
that are designated

00:56:12.760 --> 00:56:18.040
by the player he was in that
they wrote bad reviews of.

00:56:18.040 --> 00:56:20.770
He was Titus Andronicus,
and so he takes the critic

00:56:20.770 --> 00:56:25.630
and bakes their dogs
into a pie kind of thing.

00:56:25.630 --> 00:56:29.890
I've always wanted to do
a remake of that film.

00:56:29.890 --> 00:56:31.870
If anybody has any ideas--

00:56:31.870 --> 00:56:34.750
writers, directors,
please come see me.

00:56:34.750 --> 00:56:37.510
Because that is literally--
this incorporates everything

00:56:37.510 --> 00:56:41.020
in my brand, everything
that I get excited about.

00:56:41.020 --> 00:56:42.130
That's my dream project.

00:56:42.130 --> 00:56:44.080
SPEAKER 1: I did
want to ask about--

00:56:44.080 --> 00:56:46.129
and this might be
where we wrap up.

00:56:46.129 --> 00:56:47.170
Thanks for your question.

00:56:47.170 --> 00:56:49.420
I did want to ask
about the future of--

00:56:49.420 --> 00:56:51.110
the larger IP.

00:56:51.110 --> 00:56:54.611
You guys have a wildly
engaged audience.

00:56:54.611 --> 00:56:56.110
A lot of the artwork
that you showed

00:56:56.110 --> 00:57:01.150
was brought to you from
the subreddit, from Tumblr,

00:57:01.150 --> 00:57:01.900
and the community.

00:57:01.900 --> 00:57:03.691
I wanted to ask about
the future of the IP,

00:57:03.691 --> 00:57:06.190
and what you guys
might have planned,

00:57:06.190 --> 00:57:07.282
as far as expanding it.

00:57:07.282 --> 00:57:08.740
Because it does
seem like you could

00:57:08.740 --> 00:57:12.340
go in a film kind of direction,
or in a television series

00:57:12.340 --> 00:57:13.090
kind of direction.

00:57:13.090 --> 00:57:14.800
Maybe a role-playing game.

00:57:14.800 --> 00:57:16.250
CECIL BALDWIN: Oh my god, yeah.

00:57:16.250 --> 00:57:21.825
The hardest part about it
is, there's no boundaries.

00:57:21.825 --> 00:57:23.200
One of the things
that we learned

00:57:23.200 --> 00:57:24.574
working with the
Neo-Futurists is

00:57:24.574 --> 00:57:26.920
that putting
boundaries on things

00:57:26.920 --> 00:57:29.240
actually lets you
be more creative.

00:57:29.240 --> 00:57:30.460
It defines your sandbox.

00:57:33.890 --> 00:57:36.372
These are the box of crayons.

00:57:36.372 --> 00:57:38.080
It doesn't matter if
you have five colors

00:57:38.080 --> 00:57:40.560
or if you have 5,000 colors.

00:57:40.560 --> 00:57:43.780
What you can produce
from that is infinite.

00:57:43.780 --> 00:57:45.320
But you only have five--

00:57:45.320 --> 00:57:47.560
those are the parameters.

00:57:47.560 --> 00:57:51.610
What's interesting about where
"Night Vale" is heading next

00:57:51.610 --> 00:57:54.760
is, we are limited by
our own experiences

00:57:54.760 --> 00:57:57.130
and what we know to do.

00:57:57.130 --> 00:58:00.280
Would I love to see a Magic:
The Gathering-style card

00:58:00.280 --> 00:58:01.170
game of "Night Vale?"

00:58:01.170 --> 00:58:02.740
Hell yes I would!

00:58:02.740 --> 00:58:05.620
I would play that all day.

00:58:05.620 --> 00:58:07.960
Would I love to see a
Off-Broadway musical

00:58:07.960 --> 00:58:08.890
about "Night Vale?"

00:58:08.890 --> 00:58:10.240
Yeah, absolutely.

00:58:10.240 --> 00:58:11.080
But I can't write--

00:58:11.080 --> 00:58:13.810
I'm not a musical person.

00:58:13.810 --> 00:58:17.140
I have a limited amount
of knowledge in that area.

00:58:17.140 --> 00:58:20.170
I can't be like, you know what,
I'm going to write a musical.

00:58:20.170 --> 00:58:24.530
It would take a lot of work and
a lot of years to get there.

00:58:24.530 --> 00:58:27.160
I've never line
produced a TV show

00:58:27.160 --> 00:58:29.290
or been a show
runner on a TV show.

00:58:29.290 --> 00:58:32.050
We're finding ourselves
having to align ourselves

00:58:32.050 --> 00:58:35.740
with people that are as
passionate about the project

00:58:35.740 --> 00:58:38.410
as we are, and as passionate
about the integrity

00:58:38.410 --> 00:58:43.090
of the project, and also
have those skill sets.

00:58:43.090 --> 00:58:45.977
Those things take time.

00:58:45.977 --> 00:58:47.560
Those people are
definitely out there,

00:58:47.560 --> 00:58:49.390
but it's all about
finding them, in the way

00:58:49.390 --> 00:58:51.670
that the "Thrilling Adventure
Hour" people found us,

00:58:51.670 --> 00:58:52.880
so we found them.

00:58:52.880 --> 00:58:55.690
It was like oh, you get this.

00:58:55.690 --> 00:58:58.390
Because there's
nothing worse than--

00:58:58.390 --> 00:59:01.660
I think everybody
here is very savvy.

00:59:01.660 --> 00:59:05.920
You can tell when a project
was made just for a cash grab.

00:59:05.920 --> 00:59:11.440
When you're like, OK, we totally
rebooted this thing one more

00:59:11.440 --> 00:59:14.090
time just so some people
can make some money.

00:59:14.090 --> 00:59:16.210
But there's no heart into it.

00:59:16.210 --> 00:59:18.170
I think "Night Vale" is
the opposite of that,

00:59:18.170 --> 00:59:20.980
in that we would
rather do the work

00:59:20.980 --> 00:59:22.870
and feel passionate about it.

00:59:22.870 --> 00:59:25.510
And if it takes us 10
years to make a film,

00:59:25.510 --> 00:59:27.550
it took us 10 years
to make a film.

00:59:27.550 --> 00:59:30.040
If it takes us 20 years
to make a card game--

00:59:30.040 --> 00:59:32.830
which seems a bit extreme--

00:59:32.830 --> 00:59:34.570
but that's how long it took.

00:59:34.570 --> 00:59:36.220
But you better
believe that we all

00:59:36.220 --> 00:59:40.770
felt the best about it
every step of the way.

00:59:40.770 --> 00:59:43.810
I think that's an unusual thing.

00:59:43.810 --> 00:59:45.550
People talk a lot
about selling out

00:59:45.550 --> 00:59:48.730
and da-da-da and
this whole thing.

00:59:48.730 --> 00:59:50.730
It's not so black and
white as all that.

00:59:50.730 --> 00:59:53.160
You've just got
to make decisions

00:59:53.160 --> 00:59:56.340
based on the information
that's in front of you.

00:59:56.340 --> 01:00:00.060
Someday if these many
things come to pass,

01:00:00.060 --> 01:00:00.900
that'd be amazing.

01:00:00.900 --> 01:00:02.910
But you want to do it right.

01:00:02.910 --> 01:00:05.490
I think it's better to feel
passionate about the work

01:00:05.490 --> 01:00:07.650
than it is to to get
it out there in order

01:00:07.650 --> 01:00:11.730
to just have it be out
there, and pay your mortgage

01:00:11.730 --> 01:00:13.016
or whatever.

01:00:13.016 --> 01:00:14.640
SPEAKER 1: Well, I
think the fandom now

01:00:14.640 --> 01:00:15.870
has new marching orders.

01:00:15.870 --> 01:00:16.980
For the next four
months, you're going

01:00:16.980 --> 01:00:18.480
to get "Night Vale:
The Gathering"

01:00:18.480 --> 01:00:19.635
magic cards to your inbox.

01:00:19.635 --> 01:00:20.460
CECIL BALDWIN:
Great, let's do it.

01:00:20.460 --> 01:00:20.970
SPEAKER 1: Thank
you, Cecil so much.

01:00:20.970 --> 01:00:21.180
CECIL BALDWIN: Absolutely.

01:00:21.180 --> 01:00:21.300
Thank you so much.

01:00:21.300 --> 01:00:23.630
SPEAKER 1: Thank you
so much for joining us.
