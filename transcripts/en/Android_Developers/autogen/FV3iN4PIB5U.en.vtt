hopefully I will have some time and
 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.190
hopefully I will have some time and
duplicate the library you should have

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200
duplicate the library you should have
 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.430
duplicate the library you should have
used anymore would you suggest using if

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440
used anymore would you suggest using if
 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.650

you want a job to be done in the

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660
you want a job to be done in the
 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.610
you want a job to be done in the
background but relatively quickly not

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620

like like in the middle of the night but

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480
like like in the middle of the night but

with internet you know a few minutes an

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:04.489
with internet you know a few minutes an
 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:07.300
with internet you know a few minutes an
hour or something like that so work

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310
hour or something like that so work
 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.630
hour or something like that so work
major actually does try to run it faster

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640
major actually does try to run it faster
 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.040
major actually does try to run it faster
compared to job schedule like it doesn't

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:12.050
compared to job schedule like it doesn't
 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:13.930
compared to job schedule like it doesn't
delegate to the job scheduler

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940
delegate to the job scheduler
 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.180
delegate to the job scheduler
immediately it also tries to run it

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190
immediately it also tries to run it
 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:19.060
immediately it also tries to run it
itself so work manager will work most of

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:19.070
itself so work manager will work most of
 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:21.910
itself so work manager will work most of

if you are trying to run them in memory

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510
if you are trying to run them in memory
 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:37.270
if you are trying to run them in memory
instantly there is like a much better

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280
instantly there is like a much better
 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.150
instantly there is like a much better
API with codecs and stuff so we decided

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:40.160
API with codecs and stuff so we decided
 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:45.400
API with codecs and stuff so we decided
to keep them separate if anyone knows

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:45.410

through all the lint to make sure that
you don't accidentally directly my plan

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:39.770
you don't accidentally directly my plan
 

00:10:39.770 --> 00:10:42.580
you don't accidentally directly my plan
is to make lint five to ten times slower

00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:42.590
is to make lint five to ten times slower
 

00:10:42.590 --> 00:10:45.220
is to make lint five to ten times slower
over the next year Oh things right and

00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:45.230
over the next year Oh things right and
 

00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:46.840
over the next year Oh things right and
I'm doing that because I want to add

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:46.850
I'm doing that because I want to add
 

00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:48.310
I'm doing that because I want to add
more checks I'm gonna look for things

00:10:48.310 --> 00:10:48.320
more checks I'm gonna look for things
 

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:50.620
more checks I'm gonna look for things
more deeply do add more whole program

00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:50.630
more deeply do add more whole program
 

00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:53.920
more deeply do add more whole program
analysis and I think for most people

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:53.930
analysis and I think for most people
 

00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:55.630
analysis and I think for most people
it's it's more important for link to

00:10:55.630 --> 00:10:55.640
it's it's more important for link to
 

00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:57.370
it's it's more important for link to
find more bugs than furtive run

00:10:57.370 --> 00:10:57.380
find more bugs than furtive run
 

00:10:57.380 --> 00:10:59.500
find more bugs than furtive run
and so I would recommend instead running

00:10:59.500 --> 00:10:59.510
and so I would recommend instead running
 

00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:01.600
and so I would recommend instead running
lint as a post submit thing right so

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:01.610
lint as a post submit thing right so
 

00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:03.699
lint as a post submit thing right so
that it runs maybe every night and then

00:11:03.699 --> 00:11:03.709
that it runs maybe every night and then
 

00:11:03.709 --> 00:11:05.350
that it runs maybe every night and then
you find out afterwards hey this CL

00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:05.360
you find out afterwards hey this CL
 

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:06.759
you find out afterwards hey this CL
broke something I understand they would

00:11:06.759 --> 00:11:06.769
broke something I understand they would
 

00:11:06.769 --> 00:11:08.590
broke something I understand they would
be nicer if it was fast but I'm saying

00:11:08.590 --> 00:11:08.600
be nicer if it was fast but I'm saying
 

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:10.690
be nicer if it was fast but I'm saying
that the primary goal of lint is to be

00:11:10.690 --> 00:11:10.700
that the primary goal of lint is to be
 

00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:12.880
that the primary goal of lint is to be
really comprehensive and for us to keep

00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:12.890
really comprehensive and for us to keep
 

00:11:12.890 --> 00:11:14.620
really comprehensive and for us to keep
adding more checks and that is the

00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:14.630
adding more checks and that is the
 

00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:16.150
adding more checks and that is the
opposite of trying to make it run faster

00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:16.160
opposite of trying to make it run faster
 

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:17.800
opposite of trying to make it run faster
if there was some low-hanging fruit or

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:17.810
if there was some low-hanging fruit or
 

00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:19.660
if there was some low-hanging fruit or
making faster I would love to do it we

00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:19.670
making faster I would love to do it we
 

00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:22.720
making faster I would love to do it we
went well I mean you can mark all the

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:22.730
went well I mean you can mark all the
 

00:11:22.730 --> 00:11:25.210
went well I mean you can mark all the
inputs as like inputs cacheable and I

00:11:25.210 --> 00:11:25.220
inputs as like inputs cacheable and I
 

00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:27.579
inputs as like inputs cacheable and I
think we just did that in four but I

00:11:27.579 --> 00:11:27.589
think we just did that in four but I
 

00:11:27.589 --> 00:11:29.980
think we just did that in four but I
there's a lot more work to make it run

00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:29.990
there's a lot more work to make it run
 

00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:33.490
there's a lot more work to make it run
you know in parallel yeah that's all

00:11:33.490 --> 00:11:33.500
you know in parallel yeah that's all
 

00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:33.960
you know in parallel yeah that's all
right

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:33.970
right
 

00:11:33.970 --> 00:11:36.310
right
but that that'll be like eventual

00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:36.320
but that that'll be like eventual
 

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:38.410
but that that'll be like eventual
integration if you're on earth post yeah

00:11:38.410 --> 00:11:38.420
integration if you're on earth post yeah
 

00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:39.579
integration if you're on earth post yeah
I know that there are people on the

00:11:39.579 --> 00:11:39.589
I know that there are people on the
 

00:11:39.589 --> 00:11:40.810
I know that there are people on the
Gradle team who actually are looking

00:11:40.810 --> 00:11:40.820
Gradle team who actually are looking
 

00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:42.699
Gradle team who actually are looking
into making lint run faster it's just

00:11:42.699 --> 00:11:42.709
into making lint run faster it's just
 

00:11:42.709 --> 00:11:44.680
into making lint run faster it's just
that we don't see a lot of low-hanging

00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:44.690
that we don't see a lot of low-hanging
 

00:11:44.690 --> 00:11:47.470
that we don't see a lot of low-hanging
fruit and it again it's not at least not

00:11:47.470 --> 00:11:47.480
fruit and it again it's not at least not
 

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:51.069
fruit and it again it's not at least not
my top priority all right this is a

00:11:51.069 --> 00:11:51.079
my top priority all right this is a
 

00:11:51.079 --> 00:11:55.389
my top priority all right this is a
second one from it so there is basil

00:11:55.389 --> 00:11:55.399
second one from it so there is basil
 

00:11:55.399 --> 00:11:58.720
second one from it so there is basil
right let me start that way there was

00:11:58.720 --> 00:11:58.730
right let me start that way there was
 

00:11:58.730 --> 00:12:01.420
right let me start that way there was
basil con the basil is open source so

00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:01.430

think about it every time you add

00:12:11.410 --> 00:12:11.420
think about it every time you add
 

00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:14.980
think about it every time you add
another language or build system or IDE

00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:14.990
another language or build system or IDE
 

00:12:14.990 --> 00:12:16.810
another language or build system or IDE
it's a lot more work right so when we

00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:16.820
it's a lot more work right so when we
 

00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:18.400
it's a lot more work right so when we
started working on enter studio we

00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:18.410
started working on enter studio we
 

00:12:18.410 --> 00:12:19.630
started working on enter studio we
stopped working on Eclipse because

00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:19.640
stopped working on Eclipse because
 

00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:21.519
stopped working on Eclipse because

Eclipse will have this plugin for you

00:12:22.930 --> 00:12:22.940
Eclipse will have this plugin for you
 

00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:23.980

all you want to tell Joe here's his
other plug-in there's a lot to be gained

00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:26.450
other plug-in there's a lot to be gained
 

00:12:26.450 --> 00:12:27.940
other plug-in there's a lot to be gained
when you focus on making one thing work

00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:27.950
when you focus on making one thing work
 

00:12:27.950 --> 00:12:29.949
when you focus on making one thing work
really well and so right now we are

00:12:29.949 --> 00:12:29.959
really well and so right now we are
 

00:12:29.959 --> 00:12:31.720
really well and so right now we are
focusing on making great all work as

00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:31.730
focusing on making great all work as
 

00:12:31.730 --> 00:12:34.060
focusing on making great all work as
well as it as we can make it fair enough

00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:34.070
well as it as we can make it fair enough
 

00:12:34.070 --> 00:12:36.040
well as it as we can make it fair enough
yeah right thanks

00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:36.050
yeah right thanks
 

00:12:36.050 --> 00:12:40.780
yeah right thanks
yes hi so back in the day like back in

00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:40.790
yes hi so back in the day like back in
 

00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:43.019
yes hi so back in the day like back in
2011 we had Android App Inventor

00:12:43.019 --> 00:12:43.029
2011 we had Android App Inventor
 

00:12:43.029 --> 00:12:46.480
2011 we had Android App Inventor
actually we I used to use it to teach it

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:46.490
actually we I used to use it to teach it
 

00:12:46.490 --> 00:12:48.430
actually we I used to use it to teach it
to kids in the summer camps and it was

00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:48.440
to kids in the summer camps and it was
 

00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:51.790
to kids in the summer camps and it was
like a good no code tool but then it got

00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:51.800
like a good no code tool but then it got
 

00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:54.100
like a good no code tool but then it got
deprecated and like I was just curious

00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:54.110
deprecated and like I was just curious
 

00:12:54.110 --> 00:12:57.970
deprecated and like I was just curious
like do you guys have any like is any no

00:12:57.970 --> 00:12:57.980
like do you guys have any like is any no
 

00:12:57.980 --> 00:13:00.430
like do you guys have any like is any no
code framework which we can use right

00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:00.440
code framework which we can use right
 

00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:02.680
code framework which we can use right
now just I think that what happened was

00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:02.690
now just I think that what happened was
 

00:13:02.690 --> 00:13:05.019
now just I think that what happened was
that it's been taken over by I want to

00:13:05.019 --> 00:13:05.029
that it's been taken over by I want to
 

00:13:05.029 --> 00:13:06.400
that it's been taken over by I want to
say MIT I'm not sure exactly which

00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:06.410
say MIT I'm not sure exactly which
 

00:13:06.410 --> 00:13:08.050
say MIT I'm not sure exactly which
universe did get absorbed in some of the

00:13:08.050 --> 00:13:08.060
universe did get absorbed in some of the
 

00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:09.460
universe did get absorbed in some of the
project yeah I think they're still

00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:09.470
project yeah I think they're still
 

00:13:09.470 --> 00:13:10.600
project yeah I think they're still
developing it

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:10.610
developing it
 

00:13:10.610 --> 00:13:12.370
developing it
one of my daughter's is using it in

00:13:12.370 --> 00:13:12.380
one of my daughter's is using it in
 

00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:16.840
one of my daughter's is using it in
college okay okay so like means but they

00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:16.850
college okay okay so like means but they
 

00:13:16.850 --> 00:13:19.000
college okay okay so like means but they
were not a lot of updates coming in so

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:19.010
were not a lot of updates coming in so
 

00:13:19.010 --> 00:13:22.509
were not a lot of updates coming in so
yeah we're not working on it oh I think

00:13:22.509 --> 00:13:22.519
yeah we're not working on it oh I think
 

00:13:22.519 --> 00:13:24.190
yeah we're not working on it oh I think
that it was originally maybe developed

00:13:24.190 --> 00:13:24.200
that it was originally maybe developed
 

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:26.949
that it was originally maybe developed
together you know academia and Google

00:13:26.949 --> 00:13:26.959
together you know academia and Google
 

00:13:26.959 --> 00:13:29.639
together you know academia and Google
we're not working on that right now but

00:13:29.639 --> 00:13:29.649
we're not working on that right now but
 

00:13:29.649 --> 00:13:35.040
we're not working on that right now but
would you like us to work on it

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:35.050
 
 

00:13:35.050 --> 00:13:37.420
 
what what in particulars that you like

00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:37.430
what what in particulars that you like
 

00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:39.910
what what in particulars that you like
about it is the is it the no source file

00:13:39.910 --> 00:13:39.920
about it is the is it the no source file
 

00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:41.440
about it is the is it the no source file
like this the actual visual programming

00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:41.450
like this the actual visual programming
 

00:13:41.450 --> 00:13:43.720
like this the actual visual programming
or is it the component based development

00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:43.730
or is it the component based development
 

00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:45.579
or is it the component based development
of sort of taking ready-made not just

00:13:45.579 --> 00:13:45.589
of sort of taking ready-made not just
 

00:13:45.589 --> 00:13:46.720

widgets but things like select

00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:46.730
widgets but things like select
 

00:13:46.730 --> 00:13:48.280
widgets but things like select
accelerometers and who can those up like

00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:48.290
accelerometers and who can those up like
 

00:13:48.290 --> 00:13:50.590
accelerometers and who can those up like
what specifically is it that you want so

00:13:50.590 --> 00:13:50.600
what specifically is it that you want so
 

00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:53.410
what specifically is it that you want so
like when I was using it for teaching it

00:13:53.410 --> 00:13:53.420
like when I was using it for teaching it
 

00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:56.410
like when I was using it for teaching it
to kids right like means in in the third

00:13:56.410 --> 00:13:56.420
to kids right like means in in the third
 

00:13:56.420 --> 00:13:57.910
to kids right like means in in the third
or the fourth grade like means it's

00:13:57.910 --> 00:13:57.920
or the fourth grade like means it's
 

00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:00.069
or the fourth grade like means it's
really exciting for them to just develop

00:14:00.069 --> 00:14:00.079
really exciting for them to just develop
 

00:14:00.079 --> 00:14:02.800
really exciting for them to just develop
an app and at that time it like it was

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:02.810
an app and at that time it like it was
 

00:14:02.810 --> 00:14:04.930
an app and at that time it like it was
intuitive for me as well so I was just

00:14:04.930 --> 00:14:04.940

something let's not doesn't matter are
 

00:17:47.110 --> 00:17:49.080
something let's not doesn't matter are
usually about like running tests in the

00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:49.090
usually about like running tests in the
 

00:17:49.090 --> 00:17:50.820
usually about like running tests in the
cloud or you don't know an actual live

00:17:59.880 --> 00:17:59.890
I mean machine are you talking about the
 

00:17:59.890 --> 00:18:02.940
I mean machine are you talking about the
device yeah your your computer okay so

00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:02.950
device yeah your your computer okay so
 

00:18:02.950 --> 00:18:05.370
device yeah your your computer okay so
you want studio so you say yeah remote

00:18:05.370 --> 00:18:05.380
you want studio so you say yeah remote
 

00:18:05.380 --> 00:18:08.280
you want studio so you say yeah remote
like a X terminal that's talking to it

00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:08.290
like a X terminal that's talking to it
 

00:18:08.290 --> 00:18:10.020
like a X terminal that's talking to it
like the yeah yeah maybe you can quote

00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:10.030
like the yeah yeah maybe you can quote
 

00:18:10.030 --> 00:18:11.760
like the yeah yeah maybe you can quote
like on your machine and then if you

00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:11.770
like on your machine and then if you
 

00:18:11.770 --> 00:18:13.440
like on your machine and then if you
need to like a fast deployment you can

00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:13.450
need to like a fast deployment you can
 

00:18:13.450 --> 00:18:15.570
need to like a fast deployment you can
have hit on the cloud or the point of it

basically X hosting should already work

00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:17.200
basically X hosting should already work
 

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:19.590
basically X hosting should already work
right if you have Linux this should be

00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:19.600
right if you have Linux this should be
 

00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:22.560
right if you have Linux this should be
possible to you already but building

00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:22.570
possible to you already but building
 

00:18:22.570 --> 00:18:24.870
possible to you already but building
this in general is a little harder yeah

00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:24.880
this in general is a little harder yeah
 

00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:27.210
this in general is a little harder yeah
it's a great question it's one we we

00:18:27.210 --> 00:18:27.220
it's a great question it's one we we
 

00:18:27.220 --> 00:18:28.710
it's a great question it's one we we
talked about we've talked about it every

00:18:28.710 --> 00:18:28.720
talked about we've talked about it every
 

00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:30.420
talked about we've talked about it every
year for the last three years it's a I

00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:30.430

think one of the advantages is it would

00:18:32.850 --> 00:18:32.860
think one of the advantages is it would
 

00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:35.310
think one of the advantages is it would
really help when you don't have a really

00:18:35.310 --> 00:18:35.320
really help when you don't have a really
 

00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:36.960
really help when you don't have a really
beefy machine yeah yeah and that is a

00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:36.970
beefy machine yeah yeah and that is a
 

00:18:36.970 --> 00:18:38.880
beefy machine yeah yeah and that is a
lot of users for those of you who opted

in we do watch the stats of you know how

00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:42.250
in we do watch the stats of you know how
 

00:18:42.250 --> 00:18:44.040
in we do watch the stats of you know how
much ram people have how much dis size

00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:44.050
much ram people have how much dis size
 

00:18:44.050 --> 00:18:46.440
much ram people have how much dis size
and it is you can expect it varies a lot

00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:46.450
and it is you can expect it varies a lot
 

00:18:46.450 --> 00:18:48.750

we look at those stats Ben so we worry a

00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:50.170
we look at those stats Ben so we worry a
 

00:18:50.170 --> 00:18:51.720
we look at those stats Ben so we worry a
lot about places where don't people

00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:51.730
lot about places where don't people
 

00:18:51.730 --> 00:18:53.310
lot about places where don't people
don't on average have as larger machines

00:18:53.310 --> 00:18:53.320
don't on average have as larger machines
 

00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:55.080
don't on average have as larger machines
it's a great question the challenge is

00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:55.090
it's a great question the challenge is
 

00:18:55.090 --> 00:18:56.670
it's a great question the challenge is
the cost of doing that and doing that

00:18:56.670 --> 00:18:56.680
the cost of doing that and doing that
 

00:18:56.680 --> 00:18:59.700
the cost of doing that and doing that
well is exceptionally high and probably

00:18:59.700 --> 00:18:59.710
well is exceptionally high and probably
 

00:18:59.710 --> 00:19:01.110
well is exceptionally high and probably
a lot of you in the audience are

00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:01.120
a lot of you in the audience are
 

00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:03.120
a lot of you in the audience are
familiar with many different efforts so

00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:03.130
familiar with many different efforts so
 

00:19:03.130 --> 00:19:04.800
familiar with many different efforts so
it's a long-running debate we have as

00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:04.810
it's a long-running debate we have as
 

00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:07.590
it's a long-running debate we have as
should we do this or should we because

00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:07.600
should we do this or should we because
 

00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:09.030
should we do this or should we because
doing that would postpone a lot of other

00:19:09.030 --> 00:19:09.040
doing that would postpone a lot of other
 

00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:11.370
doing that would postpone a lot of other
efforts so we're still having that

00:19:11.370 --> 00:19:11.380
efforts so we're still having that
 

00:19:11.380 --> 00:19:13.290
efforts so we're still having that
debate and you're I'd be great to have

00:19:13.290 --> 00:19:13.300
debate and you're I'd be great to have
 

00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:14.910
debate and you're I'd be great to have
you weigh in it you know it's it's just

00:19:14.910 --> 00:19:14.920
you weigh in it you know it's it's just
 

00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:16.320
you weigh in it you know it's it's just
really a trade-off decision yeah what

00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:16.330
really a trade-off decision yeah what
 

00:19:16.330 --> 00:19:17.970
really a trade-off decision yeah what
speaking because most of the people that

00:19:17.970 --> 00:19:17.980
speaking because most of the people that
 

00:19:17.980 --> 00:19:19.620
speaking because most of the people that
I talk about why they don't code for

00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:19.630
I talk about why they don't code for
 

00:19:19.630 --> 00:19:20.640
I talk about why they don't code for
Android you just because they don't have

00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:20.650
Android you just because they don't have
 

00:19:20.650 --> 00:19:23.190
Android you just because they don't have
a proper powerful machine so for example

00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:23.200
a proper powerful machine so for example
 

00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:24.720
a proper powerful machine so for example
if you have this kind of remote

00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:24.730
if you have this kind of remote
 

00:19:24.730 --> 00:19:26.310
if you have this kind of remote

at hinge and we've been a hundred
 

00:20:40.690 --> 00:20:42.240
at hinge and we've been a hundred
percent Kotlin for about two years now

00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:42.250
percent Kotlin for about two years now
 

00:20:42.250 --> 00:20:44.160
percent Kotlin for about two years now
and it's been dopin amazing and how did

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:44.170
and it's been dopin amazing and how did
 

00:20:44.170 --> 00:20:45.660
and it's been dopin amazing and how did
you convince your executive management

00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:52.720
and a half years ago yep like the
 

00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:54.210
and a half years ago yep like the
convincing factors so that was great and

00:20:54.210 --> 00:20:54.220
convincing factors so that was great and
 

00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:59.040

wonderful amazing I have been working

00:20:59.040 --> 00:20:59.050
wonderful amazing I have been working
 

00:20:59.050 --> 00:21:01.730
wonderful amazing I have been working
really really hard at making the app as

00:21:01.730 --> 00:21:01.740
really really hard at making the app as
 

00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:06.510
really really hard at making the app as
good as I can with respect to CI and

00:21:06.510 --> 00:21:06.520
good as I can with respect to CI and
 

00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:09.110
good as I can with respect to CI and
test coverage and unit tests and

00:21:09.110 --> 00:21:09.120
test coverage and unit tests and
 

00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:11.370
test coverage and unit tests and
something that's been plaguing me for a

00:21:11.370 --> 00:21:11.380
something that's been plaguing me for a
 

00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:16.010
something that's been plaguing me for a
very long time is having code coverage

00:21:16.010 --> 00:21:16.020
very long time is having code coverage
 

00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:19.710
very long time is having code coverage
and getting the reporters to work

00:21:19.710 --> 00:21:19.720
and getting the reporters to work
 

00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:22.920
and getting the reporters to work
correctly with respect to Kotlin and the

00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:22.930
correctly with respect to Kotlin and the
 

00:21:22.930 --> 00:21:24.150
correctly with respect to Kotlin and the
40 Gradle modules that I have to

00:21:24.150 --> 00:21:24.160
40 Gradle modules that I have to
 

00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:28.230
40 Gradle modules that I have to
maintain when I run code coverage in

00:21:28.230 --> 00:21:28.240
maintain when I run code coverage in
 

00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:30.480
maintain when I run code coverage in

studio code coverage tool it works great

00:21:32.700 --> 00:21:32.710
studio code coverage tool it works great
 

00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:34.170
studio code coverage tool it works great
and amazing and then when I switch it to

00:21:34.170 --> 00:21:34.180
and amazing and then when I switch it to
 

00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:38.340
and amazing and then when I switch it to

and does happen to do correct reporting
 

00:21:58.390 --> 00:22:02.930
and does happen to do correct reporting
but I feel like it's not documented

00:22:02.930 --> 00:22:02.940
but I feel like it's not documented
 

00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:04.980
but I feel like it's not documented
anywhere and

00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:04.990
anywhere and
 

00:22:04.990 --> 00:22:09.390
anywhere and
essentially I I'm not sure where to go

00:22:09.390 --> 00:22:09.400
essentially I I'm not sure where to go
 

00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:11.910
essentially I I'm not sure where to go
or like if I upgraded J cocoa or Kotlin

00:22:11.910 --> 00:22:11.920
or like if I upgraded J cocoa or Kotlin
 

00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:13.710
or like if I upgraded J cocoa or Kotlin
at some point I'm going to break this

00:22:13.710 --> 00:22:13.720
at some point I'm going to break this
 

00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:17.460
at some point I'm going to break this
and I do love cotton and I do love

00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:17.470
and I do love cotton and I do love
 

00:22:17.470 --> 00:22:21.090
and I do love cotton and I do love
Android studio in general I just want to

00:22:21.090 --> 00:22:21.100
Android studio in general I just want to
 

00:22:21.100 --> 00:22:23.340
Android studio in general I just want to
make this better what sounds like we

00:22:23.340 --> 00:22:23.350
make this better what sounds like we
 

00:22:23.350 --> 00:22:25.620
make this better what sounds like we
just need to fix the jacoco integration

00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:25.630
just need to fix the jacoco integration
 

00:22:25.630 --> 00:22:27.630
just need to fix the jacoco integration
with our Kotlin Gradle plugin or

00:22:27.630 --> 00:22:27.640
with our Kotlin Gradle plugin or
 

00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:29.520
with our Kotlin Gradle plugin or
integrate that Stack Overflow post into

00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:29.530
integrate that Stack Overflow post into
 

00:22:29.530 --> 00:22:34.049
integrate that Stack Overflow post into
the IDE yeah I'll make sure to talk to

00:22:34.049 --> 00:22:34.059
the IDE yeah I'll make sure to talk to
 

00:22:34.059 --> 00:22:35.330
the IDE yeah I'll make sure to talk to
the Gradle team and see what we can do

00:22:35.330 --> 00:22:35.340
the Gradle team and see what we can do
 

00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:39.330
the Gradle team and see what we can do
like can we follow up afterwards to get

00:22:39.330 --> 00:22:39.340
like can we follow up afterwards to get
 

00:22:39.340 --> 00:22:41.250
like can we follow up afterwards to get
the bug report from you I'm aware that

00:22:41.250 --> 00:22:41.260
the bug report from you I'm aware that
 

00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:42.840
the bug report from you I'm aware that
earlier on there were some code coverage

00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:42.850
earlier on there were some code coverage
 

00:22:42.850 --> 00:22:45.600
earlier on there were some code coverage
issues with Kotlin but we fixed a bunch

00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:45.610
issues with Kotlin but we fixed a bunch
 

00:22:45.610 --> 00:22:47.880
issues with Kotlin but we fixed a bunch
of those recently but apparently not all

00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:47.890
of those recently but apparently not all
 

00:22:47.890 --> 00:22:50.520
of those recently but apparently not all
of them yeah some of them have

00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:50.530
of them yeah some of them have
 

00:22:50.530 --> 00:22:51.570
of them yeah some of them have
definitely been fixed there was one

00:22:51.570 --> 00:22:51.580
definitely been fixed there was one
 

00:22:51.580 --> 00:22:53.820
definitely been fixed there was one
really weird bug where I could only run

00:22:53.820 --> 00:22:53.830
really weird bug where I could only run
 

00:22:53.830 --> 00:22:57.480
really weird bug where I could only run
unit tests on a single file at a time I

00:22:57.480 --> 00:22:57.490
unit tests on a single file at a time I
 

00:22:57.490 --> 00:22:59.610
unit tests on a single file at a time I
couldn't run it on an entire module if

00:22:59.610 --> 00:22:59.620
couldn't run it on an entire module if
 

00:22:59.620 --> 00:23:00.810
couldn't run it on an entire module if
we could follow up with you afterwards

00:23:00.810 --> 00:23:00.820
we could follow up with you afterwards
 

00:23:00.820 --> 00:23:04.230
we could follow up with you afterwards
and we can get the details Thanks hi hi

00:23:04.230 --> 00:23:04.240
and we can get the details Thanks hi hi
 

00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:07.430
and we can get the details Thanks hi hi
what is the reason behind the JVM base

00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:07.440
what is the reason behind the JVM base
 

00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:10.020
what is the reason behind the JVM base
instrumentation tests in robolectric for

00:23:10.020 --> 00:23:10.030
instrumentation tests in robolectric for
 

00:23:10.030 --> 00:23:18.210
instrumentation tests in robolectric for
dotto I am JVM instrumentation tests

00:23:18.210 --> 00:23:18.220
dotto I am JVM instrumentation tests
 

00:23:18.220 --> 00:23:21.270
dotto I am JVM instrumentation tests
yeah so now you can run Android tests

00:23:21.270 --> 00:23:21.280
yeah so now you can run Android tests
 

00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:23.270
yeah so now you can run Android tests
instead of on device you can write it on

00:23:23.270 --> 00:23:23.280
instead of on device you can write it on
 

00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:26.640
instead of on device you can write it on
JVM instead with robolectric for dot oh

00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:26.650
JVM instead with robolectric for dot oh
 

00:23:26.650 --> 00:23:28.560
JVM instead with robolectric for dot oh
yeah that's right so there's an you know

00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:28.570
yeah that's right so there's an you know
 

00:23:28.570 --> 00:23:30.210
yeah that's right so there's an you know
in Android there's two kinds of tests

00:23:30.210 --> 00:23:30.220
in Android there's two kinds of tests
 

00:23:30.220 --> 00:23:33.210
in Android there's two kinds of tests
there's local JVM tests and they're in

00:23:33.210 --> 00:23:33.220
there's local JVM tests and they're in
 

00:23:33.220 --> 00:23:34.700
there's local JVM tests and they're in
your test folder and then

00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:34.710
your test folder and then
 

00:23:34.710 --> 00:23:36.419
your test folder and then
instrumentation tests between your

00:23:36.419 --> 00:23:36.429
instrumentation tests between your
 

00:23:36.429 --> 00:23:41.160
instrumentation tests between your
android test folder you can use like

00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:41.170
android test folder you can use like
 

00:23:41.170 --> 00:23:43.110
android test folder you can use like
mockable jar or you can use robolectric

00:23:43.110 --> 00:23:43.120
mockable jar or you can use robolectric
 

00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:45.450
mockable jar or you can use robolectric
in those local tests what we're doing

00:23:45.450 --> 00:23:45.460
in those local tests what we're doing
 

00:23:45.460 --> 00:23:47.250
in those local tests what we're doing
with Android X tests is bringing a

00:23:47.250 --> 00:23:47.260
with Android X tests is bringing a
 

00:23:47.260 --> 00:23:49.919
with Android X tests is bringing a
unified testing API into Android X tests

00:23:49.919 --> 00:23:49.929
unified testing API into Android X tests
 

00:23:49.929 --> 00:23:52.890
unified testing API into Android X tests
because each mode of testing has

00:23:52.890 --> 00:23:52.900
because each mode of testing has
 

00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:55.740
because each mode of testing has
different api's and styles it's very

00:23:55.740 --> 00:23:55.750
different api's and styles it's very
 

00:23:55.750 --> 00:23:58.470
different api's and styles it's very
confusing for developers so in terms of

00:23:58.470 --> 00:23:58.480
confusing for developers so in terms of
 

00:23:58.480 --> 00:23:59.690
confusing for developers so in terms of
robolectric have just basically

00:23:59.690 --> 00:23:59.700
robolectric have just basically
 

00:23:59.700 --> 00:24:01.740
robolectric have just basically
implements the same API is that

00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:01.750
implements the same API is that
 

00:24:01.750 --> 00:24:04.500
implements the same API is that
instrumentation implements so you can

00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:04.510
instrumentation implements so you can
 

00:24:04.510 --> 00:24:08.130
instrumentation implements so you can
write the same tests in both local unit

00:24:08.130 --> 00:24:08.140
write the same tests in both local unit
 

00:24:08.140 --> 00:24:10.680
write the same tests in both local unit
tests and instrumentation so are you

00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:10.690
tests and instrumentation so are you
 

00:24:10.690 --> 00:24:14.480
tests and instrumentation so are you
merging the Android test folder in the

00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:14.490
merging the Android test folder in the
 

00:24:14.490 --> 00:24:16.820
merging the Android test folder in the
the normal unit test folder in the

00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:16.830
the normal unit test folder in the
 

00:24:16.830 --> 00:24:19.340
the normal unit test folder in the
Android studio and well I don't think

00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:19.350
Android studio and well I don't think
 

00:24:19.350 --> 00:24:21.080
Android studio and well I don't think
like there's actually been any decision

00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:21.090
like there's actually been any decision
 

00:24:21.090 --> 00:24:23.510
like there's actually been any decision
yet on that but and in terms of right

00:24:23.510 --> 00:24:23.520
yet on that but and in terms of right
 

00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:25.419
yet on that but and in terms of right
now you can use the same API is in both

00:24:25.419 --> 00:24:25.429
now you can use the same API is in both
 

00:24:25.429 --> 00:24:28.760
now you can use the same API is in both
we've got another talk today on project

00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:28.770
we've got another talk today on project
 

00:24:28.770 --> 00:24:30.740
we've got another talk today on project
nitrogen so if you think about the tests

00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:30.750
nitrogen so if you think about the tests
 

00:24:30.750 --> 00:24:33.169
nitrogen so if you think about the tests
or what you run project nitrogen sort of

00:24:33.169 --> 00:24:33.179
or what you run project nitrogen sort of
 

00:24:33.179 --> 00:24:35.330
or what you run project nitrogen sort of
is the how and the where and so I'd

00:24:35.330 --> 00:24:35.340
is the how and the where and so I'd
 

00:24:35.340 --> 00:24:36.620
is the how and the where and so I'd
encourage you to check that talk out

00:24:36.620 --> 00:24:36.630
encourage you to check that talk out
 

00:24:36.630 --> 00:24:41.360
encourage you to check that talk out
today is like 4:45 I believe and and

00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:41.370
today is like 4:45 I believe and and
 

00:24:41.370 --> 00:24:43.970
today is like 4:45 I believe and and
will you provide code coverage for both

00:24:43.970 --> 00:24:43.980
will you provide code coverage for both
 

00:24:43.980 --> 00:24:47.000
will you provide code coverage for both
unit tests and functional tests and we

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:47.010
unit tests and functional tests and we
 

00:24:47.010 --> 00:24:50.770
unit tests and functional tests and we
would hope so thank you thanks ok I

00:24:50.770 --> 00:24:50.780
would hope so thank you thanks ok I
 

00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:54.500

it we're unable to use Android studio

00:28:15.670 --> 00:28:15.680
it we're unable to use Android studio
 

00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:18.160
it we're unable to use Android studio
yeah I know that's my issue with it I

00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:18.170
yeah I know that's my issue with it I
 

00:28:18.170 --> 00:28:19.570
yeah I know that's my issue with it I
don't want to edit it and give it four

00:28:19.570 --> 00:28:19.580
don't want to edit it and give it four
 

00:28:19.580 --> 00:28:21.820
don't want to edit it and give it four
or eight gigs but it's not a usable

00:28:21.820 --> 00:28:21.830
or eight gigs but it's not a usable
 

00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:23.440
or eight gigs but it's not a usable
experience we get pop up saying that we

00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:23.450
experience we get pop up saying that we
 

00:28:23.450 --> 00:28:25.060
experience we get pop up saying that we
don't give it more RAM yeah so one of

00:28:25.060 --> 00:28:25.070
don't give it more RAM yeah so one of
 

00:28:25.070 --> 00:28:26.410
don't give it more RAM yeah so one of
the things we want to do is to try to

00:28:26.410 --> 00:28:26.420
the things we want to do is to try to
 

00:28:26.420 --> 00:28:27.700
the things we want to do is to try to
auto configure that so you don't have to

00:28:27.700 --> 00:28:27.710
auto configure that so you don't have to
 

00:28:27.710 --> 00:28:30.090
auto configure that so you don't have to
do it we also want to try to reduce the

00:28:30.090 --> 00:28:30.100
do it we also want to try to reduce the
 

00:28:30.100 --> 00:28:32.770
do it we also want to try to reduce the
obvious inefficiency since some of the

00:28:32.770 --> 00:28:32.780
obvious inefficiency since some of the
 

00:28:32.780 --> 00:28:34.450
obvious inefficiency since some of the
things we're doing we're also looking at

00:28:34.450 --> 00:28:34.460
things we're doing we're also looking at
 

00:28:34.460 --> 00:28:36.280
things we're doing we're also looking at

like there is a misconception that just
 

00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:45.490
like there is a misconception that just
because you can do it you should do it

00:29:45.490 --> 00:29:45.500
because you can do it you should do it
 

00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:47.140
because you can do it you should do it
like you don't put all of your code into

00:29:47.140 --> 00:29:47.150
like you don't put all of your code into
 

00:29:47.150 --> 00:29:49.060
like you don't put all of your code into
your activity either right we divide

data mining just because you can write
 

00:29:53.870 --> 00:29:55.840
data mining just because you can write
like complex expression doesn't mean you

00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:55.850
like complex expression doesn't mean you
 

00:29:55.850 --> 00:29:58.270

should write in terms of efficiency yes

00:29:58.270 --> 00:29:58.280
should write in terms of efficiency yes
 

00:29:58.280 --> 00:30:00.010
should write in terms of efficiency yes
actually data binding like tries to

00:30:00.010 --> 00:30:00.020
actually data binding like tries to
 

00:30:00.020 --> 00:30:02.529
actually data binding like tries to
generate more efficient code than they

00:30:02.529 --> 00:30:02.539
generate more efficient code than they
 

00:30:02.539 --> 00:30:05.260
generate more efficient code than they
would normally write but is it like a

00:30:05.260 --> 00:30:05.270
would normally write but is it like a
 

00:30:05.270 --> 00:30:07.330
would normally write but is it like a
decision point definitely not it's not

00:30:07.330 --> 00:30:07.340

going to make a big change you probably

00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:08.570

have like a bigger fish to fry

00:30:10.980 --> 00:30:10.990
have like a bigger fish to fry
 

00:30:10.990 --> 00:30:14.320
have like a bigger fish to fry
but like I personally like you know I

00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:14.330
but like I personally like you know I
 

00:30:14.330 --> 00:30:16.270
but like I personally like you know I
worked on it and I used to use it in

00:30:16.270 --> 00:30:16.280
worked on it and I used to use it in
 

00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:18.190
worked on it and I used to use it in
other platforms before I do like the

00:30:18.190 --> 00:30:18.200
other platforms before I do like the
 

00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:20.380
other platforms before I do like the
declarative nature of data binding that

00:30:20.380 --> 00:30:20.390
declarative nature of data binding that
 

00:30:20.390 --> 00:30:22.000
declarative nature of data binding that
makes it like you just say put this

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:22.010
makes it like you just say put this
 

00:30:22.010 --> 00:30:23.560
makes it like you just say put this
thing here and it eventually shows up

00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:23.570
thing here and it eventually shows up
 

00:30:23.570 --> 00:30:26.680
thing here and it eventually shows up
there but it's kind of a personal choice

00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:26.690
there but it's kind of a personal choice
 

00:30:26.690 --> 00:30:28.600
there but it's kind of a personal choice
like we have these things they are not

00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:28.610
like we have these things they are not
 

00:30:28.610 --> 00:30:31.810
like we have these things they are not
rules their opinions and we don't always

00:30:31.810 --> 00:30:31.820
rules their opinions and we don't always
 

00:30:31.820 --> 00:30:33.909
rules their opinions and we don't always
share the same opinion either if you

00:30:33.909 --> 00:30:33.919
share the same opinion either if you
 

00:30:33.919 --> 00:30:35.830
share the same opinion either if you
like it use it it's great and if you

00:30:35.830 --> 00:30:35.840
like it use it it's great and if you
 

00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:37.180
like it use it it's great and if you
don't like it that's like you don't have

00:30:37.180 --> 00:30:37.190
don't like it that's like you don't have
 

00:30:37.190 --> 00:30:39.789
don't like it that's like you don't have
to use anything okay it's like just

00:30:39.789 --> 00:30:39.799
to use anything okay it's like just
 

00:30:39.799 --> 00:30:42.789
to use anything okay it's like just
personal open an art that really helps

00:30:42.789 --> 00:30:42.799
personal open an art that really helps
 

00:30:42.799 --> 00:30:45.610
personal open an art that really helps
with the efficiency or anything yeah I

00:30:45.610 --> 00:30:45.620
with the efficiency or anything yeah I
 

00:30:45.620 --> 00:30:49.090
with the efficiency or anything yeah I
mean like it's is it is a like it is

00:30:49.090 --> 00:30:49.100
mean like it's is it is a like it is
 

00:30:49.100 --> 00:30:50.590
mean like it's is it is a like it is
efficient but it's not going to make a

00:30:50.590 --> 00:30:50.600
efficient but it's not going to make a
 

00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:52.299
efficient but it's not going to make a
big change for your application that's

00:30:52.299 --> 00:30:52.309
big change for your application that's
 

00:30:52.309 --> 00:30:54.250
big change for your application that's
the that's the problem that yes like

someone epic a Gradle hasn't one enters

00:31:52.210 --> 00:31:52.220
someone epic a Gradle hasn't one enters
 

00:31:52.220 --> 00:31:55.590
someone epic a Gradle hasn't one enters
here has one and that's like mismatch

00:31:55.590 --> 00:31:55.600
here has one and that's like mismatch
 

00:31:55.600 --> 00:31:58.360
here has one and that's like mismatch
yeah so in the new implementation we're

00:31:58.360 --> 00:31:58.370
yeah so in the new implementation we're
 

00:31:58.370 --> 00:32:00.790
yeah so in the new implementation we're
not hooking into the Gradle bytecode

00:32:00.790 --> 00:32:00.800
not hooking into the Gradle bytecode
 

00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:03.700

transformation pipeline ok it's done at

00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:03.710
transformation pipeline ok it's done at

runtime a bit like the profiler does

00:32:06.070 --> 00:32:06.080
runtime a bit like the profiler does
 

00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:08.350

instrumentation so it should be easier

00:32:08.350 --> 00:32:08.360
instrumentation so it should be easier
 

00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:09.940
instrumentation so it should be easier
but again it's not something we're

00:32:09.940 --> 00:32:09.950
but again it's not something we're
 

00:32:09.950 --> 00:32:12.070
but again it's not something we're
deliberately designing for but you know

00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:12.080
deliberately designing for but you know
 

00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:17.980
deliberately designing for but you know
we're trying to not to do that harder

00:32:17.980 --> 00:32:17.990
we're trying to not to do that harder
 

00:32:17.990 --> 00:32:21.710
we're trying to not to do that harder
one now so

00:32:21.710 --> 00:32:21.720
 
 

00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:23.340
 
let me put it that way

00:32:23.340 --> 00:32:23.350
let me put it that way
 

00:32:23.350 --> 00:32:28.260
let me put it that way

CL so like we understand there still a

00:33:23.730 --> 00:33:23.740
CL so like we understand there still a
 

00:33:23.740 --> 00:33:25.770
CL so like we understand there still a
barrier but we simplified it

00:33:25.770 --> 00:33:25.780
barrier but we simplified it
 

00:33:25.780 --> 00:33:27.720
barrier but we simplified it
significantly and we understand there's

00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:27.730
significantly and we understand there's
 

00:33:27.730 --> 00:33:30.450
significantly and we understand there's
a Garrett repo like tools people are not

00:33:30.450 --> 00:33:30.460
a Garrett repo like tools people are not
 

00:33:30.460 --> 00:33:33.750
a Garrett repo like tools people are not
very familiar with but we also have an

00:33:33.750 --> 00:33:33.760
very familiar with but we also have an
 

00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:36.000
very familiar with but we also have an

internal integration like with the next
 

00:33:36.010 --> 00:33:39.299
internal integration like with the next
version of Android like we need to stay

00:33:39.299 --> 00:33:39.309
version of Android like we need to stay

Android X we checked out the Android X
 

00:33:50.610 --> 00:33:54.330
Android X we checked out the Android X
repo from AOSP on to the two machines

00:33:54.330 --> 00:33:54.340
repo from AOSP on to the two machines
 

00:33:54.340 --> 00:33:56.370

that we have over at the Android X booth
 

00:33:56.380 --> 00:33:59.520
that we have over at the Android X booth
in about five minutes and we're up and

00:33:59.520 --> 00:33:59.530
in about five minutes and we're up and
 

00:33:59.530 --> 00:34:02.669
in about five minutes and we're up and
running to upload commits so if you want

like all right there's a difference to

00:34:17.260 --> 00:34:17.270
like all right there's a difference to
 

00:34:17.270 --> 00:34:19.060
like all right there's a difference to
like when you say AOSP when we think of

00:34:19.060 --> 00:34:19.070
like when you say AOSP when we think of
 

00:34:19.070 --> 00:34:20.980
like when you say AOSP when we think of
AOSP contributions in platformer yes

00:34:20.980 --> 00:34:20.990
AOSP contributions in platformer yes
 

00:34:20.990 --> 00:34:22.389
AOSP contributions in platformer yes
that is a big deal and we don't expect

00:34:22.389 --> 00:34:22.399
that is a big deal and we don't expect
 

00:34:22.399 --> 00:34:23.800
that is a big deal and we don't expect
it a lot of people are going to absorb

00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:23.810
it a lot of people are going to absorb
 

00:34:23.810 --> 00:34:25.270
it a lot of people are going to absorb
the entire platform and be able to

00:34:25.270 --> 00:34:25.280
the entire platform and be able to
 

00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:26.889
the entire platform and be able to
contribute it especially since we don't

00:34:26.889 --> 00:34:26.899
contribute it especially since we don't
 

00:34:26.899 --> 00:34:28.240
contribute it especially since we don't
release the source code until the

00:34:28.240 --> 00:34:28.250
release the source code until the
 

00:34:28.250 --> 00:34:30.040
release the source code until the
release is out but the smaller libraries

00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:30.050
release is out but the smaller libraries
 

00:34:30.050 --> 00:34:31.810
release is out but the smaller libraries
like Android X like we're actually

00:34:31.810 --> 00:34:31.820
like Android X like we're actually
 

00:34:31.820 --> 00:34:33.310
like Android X like we're actually
developing an AOSP

00:34:33.310 --> 00:34:33.320

out what the disconnects are on being

00:34:43.540 --> 00:34:43.550
out what the disconnects are on being
 

00:34:43.550 --> 00:34:45.220
out what the disconnects are on being
able to do that because the intention

00:34:45.220 --> 00:34:45.230
able to do that because the intention
 

00:34:45.230 --> 00:34:46.869
able to do that because the intention
was to make it much more possible

00:34:46.869 --> 00:34:46.879
was to make it much more possible
 

00:34:46.879 --> 00:34:48.909
was to make it much more possible
some of the projects were able to

00:34:48.909 --> 00:34:48.919
some of the projects were able to
 

00:34:48.919 --> 00:34:50.740
some of the projects were able to
succeed at that like dagger for example

00:34:50.740 --> 00:34:50.750
succeed at that like dagger for example
 

00:34:50.750 --> 00:34:53.139
succeed at that like dagger for example
and you have tooling to sync it back to

00:34:53.139 --> 00:34:53.149
and you have tooling to sync it back to
 

00:34:53.149 --> 00:34:55.690
and you have tooling to sync it back to
your mana repos I know that like you

00:34:55.690 --> 00:34:55.700
your mana repos I know that like you
 

00:34:55.700 --> 00:34:59.710
your mana repos I know that like you
know I think is be is like not the part

00:34:59.710 --> 00:34:59.720
know I think is be is like not the part
 

00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:01.990
know I think is be is like not the part
of mana Reaper Google but still is a

00:35:01.990 --> 00:35:02.000
of mana Reaper Google but still is a
 

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.150
of mana Reaper Google but still is a
mono repo so you should be able to sync

00:35:04.150 --> 00:35:04.160
mono repo so you should be able to sync
 

00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:06.970
mono repo so you should be able to sync
it back can I ask a question yes uh so

00:35:06.970 --> 00:35:06.980
it back can I ask a question yes uh so
 

00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:09.130
it back can I ask a question yes uh so
we could make contributing to AOSP

00:35:09.130 --> 00:35:09.140
we could make contributing to AOSP
 

00:35:09.140 --> 00:35:12.100
we could make contributing to AOSP
easier we could also consider github I'm

00:35:12.100 --> 00:35:12.110
easier we could also consider github I'm
 

00:35:12.110 --> 00:35:14.020

get to as many as we can before there's

00:38:56.300 --> 00:38:56.310
get to as many as we can before there's
 

00:38:56.310 --> 00:38:58.310

Ted can I ask one question - yes please
 

00:38:58.320 --> 00:39:02.180
Ted can I ask one question - yes please
you can take them first I can what they

00:39:02.180 --> 00:39:02.190
you can take them first I can what they
 

00:39:02.190 --> 00:39:12.890
you can take them first I can what they

gratitude first because I have a

00:39:14.600 --> 00:39:14.610
gratitude first because I have a
 

00:39:14.610 --> 00:39:20.900
gratitude first because I have a
compliance request so most of time on

00:39:20.900 --> 00:39:20.910
compliance request so most of time on
 

00:39:20.910 --> 00:39:23.390
compliance request so most of time on
edit studio it works fine but sometime

00:39:23.390 --> 00:39:23.400
edit studio it works fine but sometime
 

00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:24.950
edit studio it works fine but sometime
even though I refactor let's say

00:39:24.950 --> 00:39:24.960
even though I refactor let's say
 

00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:27.050
even though I refactor let's say
variable name it doesn't pick up an XML

00:39:27.050 --> 00:39:27.060
variable name it doesn't pick up an XML
 

00:39:27.060 --> 00:39:29.870
variable name it doesn't pick up an XML
file yeah so we are specifically trying

00:39:29.870 --> 00:39:29.880
file yeah so we are specifically trying
 

00:39:29.880 --> 00:39:31.640
file yeah so we are specifically trying
to address this with project marble okay

00:39:31.640 --> 00:39:31.650
to address this with project marble okay
 

00:39:31.650 --> 00:39:34.880
to address this with project marble okay
second thing like the classes you

00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:34.890
second thing like the classes you
 

00:39:34.890 --> 00:39:37.850
second thing like the classes you
generate are in the bun package so what

00:39:37.850 --> 00:39:37.860
generate are in the bun package so what
 

00:39:37.860 --> 00:39:40.580
generate are in the bun package so what
happens is like all the internal classes

00:39:40.580 --> 00:39:40.590
happens is like all the internal classes
 

00:39:40.590 --> 00:39:43.040
happens is like all the internal classes
let's say viewmodel or inside support

00:39:43.040 --> 00:39:43.050
let's say viewmodel or inside support
 

00:39:43.050 --> 00:39:44.750
let's say viewmodel or inside support
classes I have to make them public

00:39:44.750 --> 00:39:44.760
classes I have to make them public
 

00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:46.820
classes I have to make them public
because they are not accessible into the

00:39:46.820 --> 00:39:46.830
because they are not accessible into the
 

00:39:46.830 --> 00:39:48.440
because they are not accessible into the
XML file or in the data binding

00:39:48.440 --> 00:39:48.450
XML file or in the data binding
 

00:39:48.450 --> 00:39:50.990
XML file or in the data binding
generated classes no actually you could

00:39:50.990 --> 00:39:51.000
generated classes no actually you could
 

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:52.730
generated classes no actually you could
when you have a layout file you can give

00:39:52.730 --> 00:39:52.740
when you have a layout file you can give
 

00:39:52.740 --> 00:39:54.590
when you have a layout file you can give
it a class name so if you specify the

00:39:54.590 --> 00:39:54.600
it a class name so if you specify the
 

00:39:54.600 --> 00:39:56.180
it a class name so if you specify the
class name you will generate the layout

00:39:56.180 --> 00:39:56.190
class name you will generate the layout
 

00:39:56.190 --> 00:39:59.030
class name you will generate the layout
file in the binding it will be have that

00:39:59.030 --> 00:39:59.040
file in the binding it will be have that
 

00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:00.770
file in the binding it will be have that
class name with the package you provide

00:40:00.770 --> 00:40:00.780
class name with the package you provide
 

00:40:00.780 --> 00:40:03.290
class name with the package you provide
it but the data binding generated class

00:40:03.290 --> 00:40:03.300
it but the data binding generated class
 

00:40:03.300 --> 00:40:06.200
it but the data binding generated class
they are not package specific they are

00:40:06.200 --> 00:40:06.210
they are not package specific they are
 

00:40:06.210 --> 00:40:07.660
they are not package specific they are
not one place

00:40:07.660 --> 00:40:07.670
not one place
 

00:40:07.670 --> 00:40:09.700
not one place
they are if you specify the package name

00:40:09.700 --> 00:40:09.710
they are if you specify the package name
 

00:40:09.710 --> 00:40:15.309
they are if you specify the package name
that they will be there but like find me

00:40:15.309 --> 00:40:15.319
that they will be there but like find me
 

00:40:15.319 --> 00:40:17.349
that they will be there but like find me
afterwards if maybe I didn't get the

00:40:17.349 --> 00:40:17.359
afterwards if maybe I didn't get the
 

00:40:17.359 --> 00:40:19.390
afterwards if maybe I didn't get the
question third thing like if some error

00:40:19.390 --> 00:40:19.400
question third thing like if some error
 

00:40:19.400 --> 00:40:21.010
question third thing like if some error
happens it shows like two hundred plus

00:40:21.010 --> 00:40:21.020
happens it shows like two hundred plus
 

00:40:21.020 --> 00:40:24.339
happens it shows like two hundred plus
error which is hard to sometimes you

00:40:24.339 --> 00:40:24.349
error which is hard to sometimes you
 

00:40:24.349 --> 00:40:26.170
error which is hard to sometimes you
know take some time can we make that

00:40:26.170 --> 00:40:26.180
know take some time can we make that
 

00:40:26.180 --> 00:40:29.470
know take some time can we make that

00:40:31.750 --> 00:40:31.760
problem we haven't foreseen a we can not
 

00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:33.819

work round without breaking our API I

00:40:33.819 --> 00:40:33.829
work round without breaking our API I
 

00:40:33.829 --> 00:40:35.650

wish I knew this like four years ago we

00:40:35.650 --> 00:40:35.660
wish I knew this like four years ago we
 

00:40:35.660 --> 00:40:38.349
wish I knew this like four years ago we
would design something differently we

00:40:38.349 --> 00:40:38.359
would design something differently we
 

00:40:38.359 --> 00:40:40.030
would design something differently we
might like I'm getting this so many

00:40:40.030 --> 00:40:40.040
might like I'm getting this so many
 

00:40:40.040 --> 00:40:41.650
might like I'm getting this so many
times that we might actually just break

00:40:41.650 --> 00:40:41.660
times that we might actually just break
 

00:40:41.660 --> 00:40:43.690
times that we might actually just break
some of the API to work around that

00:40:43.690 --> 00:40:43.700
some of the API to work around that
 

00:40:43.700 --> 00:40:49.960
some of the API to work around that

can you put some convenience methods so

00:40:55.329 --> 00:40:55.339
can you put some convenience methods so
 

00:40:55.339 --> 00:40:56.620

questions about how we think about the
 

00:41:19.970 --> 00:41:22.539
questions about how we think about the
store and apps on the store we talked

00:41:22.539 --> 00:41:22.549
store and apps on the store we talked
 

00:41:22.549 --> 00:41:24.430

about it in the keynote people were just

00:41:24.430 --> 00:41:24.440
about it in the keynote people were just
 

00:41:24.440 --> 00:41:26.020
about it in the keynote people were just
wondering like what's the reasoning for

00:41:26.020 --> 00:41:26.030
wondering like what's the reasoning for
 

00:41:26.030 --> 00:41:28.930
