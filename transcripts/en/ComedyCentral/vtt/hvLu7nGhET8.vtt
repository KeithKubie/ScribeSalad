Boo doo-doo woo doo-doo.

00:00:03.135 --> 00:00:05.638
No bullshit aside,
I know it's our song now,

00:00:05.671 --> 00:00:07.740 line:92%
but it is one of the best songs

00:00:07.773 --> 00:00:09.876
to be angry
in your car alone with.

00:00:09.909 --> 00:00:13.012
Oh, yeah. It's a real after-work
steering wheel puncher.

00:00:13.045 --> 00:00:15.381
Yeah, fuck you, Jenson.
I'm not coming early in.

00:00:15.414 --> 00:00:16.783
What? Fuck you
and those reports.

00:00:16.816 --> 00:00:18.251
Oh, what?
My reports are gonna be late!

00:00:18.284 --> 00:00:20.520
Oh, yeah, no, I did fill up
the coffee, Janice.

00:00:20.553 --> 00:00:22.255 line:92%
I did. I know you didn't.

00:00:22.288 --> 00:00:23.990
I also know that you fucking
cheated on your husband

00:00:24.023 --> 00:00:25.725
at the Christmas party.
Fucking, come on, rage!

00:00:25.758 --> 00:00:26.959
I see you taking home
coffee filters.

00:00:26.992 --> 00:00:28.194 line:92%
I see you!

00:00:28.227 --> 00:00:29.429 line:92%
I fucking see you taking home

00:00:29.462 --> 00:00:30.630 line:92%
coffee filters.

00:00:30.663 --> 00:00:32.598
And I fucking buy dumb shit
out of your kid's catalog,

00:00:32.631 --> 00:00:34.000 line:92%
every fucking time you bring it.

00:00:34.033 --> 00:00:35.201 line:92%
I don't need corncob holders.

00:00:35.234 --> 00:00:36.436 line:92%
Corncob holders?

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:38.071 line:92%
Why do I need corncob holders?

00:00:38.104 --> 00:00:39.372 line:92%
Corncob

00:00:39.405 --> 00:00:41.441
I'm helping your stupid fucking
kid get a basketball uniform.

00:00:41.474 --> 00:00:44.377
The only thing worth the shit in
that's those green fudge frogs.

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:49.649
Hey everyone, it's Bonfire,
coming to

00:00:49.682 --> 00:00:51.317 line:92%
your radio, Sirius XM 95.

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:52.551 line:92%
Mm-hmm 

00:00:52.585 --> 00:00:55.288
We're live on a Wednesday, here
in a freezing cold New York.

00:00:55.321 --> 00:00:56.522 line:85%
Love it. I love it.

00:00:56.555 --> 00:00:59.859
You just said what you love
most out of the- by the way,

00:00:59.892 --> 00:01:02.061
if we had a call screen,
I would say great caller topic.

00:01:02.094 --> 00:01:04.897
Call in and tell us what you've
ordered out of that kids thing.

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:06.732
Me and Christine
got magazine subscriptions

00:01:06.765 --> 00:01:08.234 line:92%
that we never received.

00:01:08.267 --> 00:01:10.336
Fucking magazine subscription!
you gotta go chocolates.

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:11.537
-Yeah
-it's the only good thing.

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:12.772 line:92%
Yeah, but I don't know-

00:01:12.805 --> 00:01:13.973
'Cause when this is off-
...

00:01:14.006 --> 00:01:15.341
I see an apple slicer,
and I'm like, when else

00:01:15.374 --> 00:01:17.376
am I gonna be in a position
to impulse buy this?

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:20.313
It's off brand
delicious chocolates.

00:01:20.346 --> 00:01:21.681 line:92%
It's the fucking curve balls of-

00:01:21.714 --> 00:01:22.915 line:92%
Very off brand.

00:01:22.948 --> 00:01:24.117
'Cause you get
those fudge frogs.

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.351
I'm telling you right now-
They're store brand.

00:01:25.384 --> 00:01:27.854
I mean, you're getting
the key foods

00:01:27.887 --> 00:01:29.489
Write in to the Bonfire,
if your kid has a catalog,

00:01:29.522 --> 00:01:31.691 line:92%
I promise, depending on how-

00:01:31.724 --> 00:01:33.326
I'm confident not that
many people write in,

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:34.727
but if your kid
has one of those catalogs

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.395
with those fudge frogs in
it write in-

00:01:36.428 --> 00:01:37.797
But I bet we get a shitload
of catalogs, right now.

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:38.998 line:92%
Do it. The first-

00:01:39.031 --> 00:01:40.266 line:92%
Everyone's trying to move.

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:42.602
The first five people I will buy
fudge frogs off your kid.

00:01:42.635 --> 00:01:43.870
-Yeah?
-Love 'em.

00:01:43.903 --> 00:01:45.571
-You love 'em?
-Love 'em. The green ones?

00:01:45.604 --> 00:01:47.140
You don't go peanut butter cups,
or anything like that.

00:01:47.173 --> 00:01:48.407 line:92%
Hell yeah, I do.

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.376 line:92%
But fudge frogs are your shit.

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:52.044
I'm leading with fudge frogs,
in the catalog.

00:01:52.077 --> 00:01:53.946
I don't think I know what the
fudge frogs are, what are they?

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:55.648
They're the little green,
when we get the screens up-

00:01:55.681 --> 00:01:56.916 line:92%
They're green?

00:01:56.949 --> 00:01:58.818 line:92%
Yeah, they're like, green fudge.

00:01:58.851 --> 00:02:00.553
One of the waitresses
from the Cellar always-

00:02:00.586 --> 00:02:01.854
she used to bring these
to Saint Louis.

00:02:01.887 --> 00:02:03.089 line:92%
Saint Louis?

00:02:03.122 --> 00:02:04.524
When Melissa would
bring the catalog,

00:02:04.557 --> 00:02:06.025 line:92%
I'd always get those.

00:02:06.058 --> 00:02:07.627
I wouldn't. I would get
a magazine subscription

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:08.961
that would never show up
to my house.

00:02:08.994 --> 00:02:10.163 line:92%
Well, cool, you're an idiot.

00:02:10.196 --> 00:02:12.165
I had delicious fudge frogs.
I was getting ripped,

00:02:12.198 --> 00:02:13.566
taking down trays
of fudge frogs.

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:14.800 line:92%
I'm gonna scratch her face off

00:02:14.833 --> 00:02:16.669
when I see her.
Where's my Rolling Stone?

00:02:16.702 --> 00:02:18.471
Oh, man, yeah. Oh, here
we go

00:02:18.504 --> 00:02:19.705 line:92%
You know what it was,

00:02:19.738 --> 00:02:20.973
I'll tell you what it was,
actually.

00:02:21.006 --> 00:02:22.275 line:92%
They give you like a voucher,

00:02:22.308 --> 00:02:24.076
that we just never even
thought twice about really.

00:02:24.109 --> 00:02:25.611
Oh, so you have to do-
you still have to do the work.

00:02:25.644 --> 00:02:27.280
You have to do some work.
No, fuck that.

00:02:27.313 --> 00:02:28.648
Yeah, so you have a voucher,
for a year.

00:02:28.681 --> 00:02:30.917
They're green fudge frogs,
let's find the name of 'em,

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:32.752
'cause I am high enough
that I might order some online.

00:02:32.785 --> 00:02:33.986 line:92%
right know.

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:35.221 line:92%
Are they mint?

00:02:35.254 --> 00:02:36.889 line:92%
Yeah, they're kind of minty.

00:02:36.922 --> 00:02:38.324
Yeah, that's why
I had-

00:02:38.357 --> 00:02:40.593
Yeah, yeah, yes! Mint,
fudge-filled frogs.

00:02:40.626 --> 00:02:42.228
They're- by the way, dude,
those are Andes Candies.

00:02:42.261 --> 00:02:43.529 line:92%
Just for the record.

00:02:43.562 --> 00:02:45.131
You're an Andy Candy.
I'll buy you Andes candies.

00:02:45.164 --> 00:02:46.465
You'll think
I'm treating you too good.

00:02:46.498 --> 00:02:47.667 line:92%
Yeah, you will.

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:48.868
Yeah.
Oh man.

00:02:48.901 --> 00:02:50.136
That's how I keep a bitch
in line.

00:02:50.169 --> 00:02:51.504
Aw, you're gonna be
Deandre-ing me.

00:02:51.537 --> 00:02:52.738
You'll see,
from the Lost Tapes.

00:02:52.771 --> 00:02:54.874
You'll see who Deandre is,
new character.

00:02:54.907 --> 00:02:58.578
It's so hard when we do
a Lost Tapes that's so fun,

00:02:58.611 --> 00:03:00.613
to not bring it up
on the live show on Wednesday.

00:03:00.646 --> 00:03:01.814 line:92%
Terminator time line.

00:03:01.847 --> 00:03:03.249
Yeah, it's total Terminator
time line,

00:03:03.282 --> 00:03:05.051 line:92%
we finished the episode.

00:03:05.084 --> 00:03:07.086
Yeah man, if you've got a kid
that's got catalogs,

00:03:07.119 --> 00:03:10.089
and they got some mint fudge
fro- mint, fudge filled frogs-

00:03:10.122 --> 00:03:11.490 line:92%
Mint fudge frogs, huh?

00:03:11.523 --> 00:03:12.892
I don't know why.
I don't know why.

00:03:12.925 --> 00:03:14.093 line:92%
They're my favorite.

00:03:14.126 --> 00:03:16.529
The animal ones, all the animal
fudge ones, I like it.

00:03:16.562 --> 00:03:17.763 line:92%
I don't know.

00:03:17.796 --> 00:03:19.031
Whoever is laughing,
I'll fight you.

00:03:19.064 --> 00:03:20.466
I'll fight everyone
in this goddamn room.

00:03:20.499 --> 00:03:21.934
It's Becky. It was a ridiculous
thing you just said.

00:03:21.967 --> 00:03:23.169 line:92%
Well, you know what, Becky-

00:03:23.202 --> 00:03:24.470
That's not her fault, at all.
It is her fault.

00:03:24.503 --> 00:03:25.771 line:92%
I feel judged.

00:03:25.804 --> 00:03:27.039
There's one review-
Christine,

00:03:27.072 --> 00:03:29.275
can we see
the one review, of this item?

00:03:29.308 --> 00:03:31.177
It's just me.
It says "Dan Soder."

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:32.812
He goes, I don't know
what it is,

00:03:32.845 --> 00:03:34.881
but these little mint
chocolate frogs ...

00:03:35.381 --> 00:03:38.384
"Amazing," you're goddamn
right it was amazing.

00:03:38.417 --> 00:03:40.086
"Yes, I would recommend
to a friend."

00:03:40.119 --> 00:03:41.887
Of course, you would.
100 percent.

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.656 line:92%
"I would recommend to a friend."

00:03:44.623 --> 00:03:46.225 line:92%
Oh, the holiday collection

00:03:46.258 --> 00:03:47.493
Here's the thing,
though, Christine,

00:03:47.526 --> 00:03:49.095
I don't wanna take money
out of- dude,

00:03:49.128 --> 00:03:50.496
I'll get chocolate
covered pretzels.

00:03:50.529 --> 00:03:51.731 line:92%
I go nuts on these catalogs.

00:03:51.764 --> 00:03:53.065 line:92%
Chocolate covered pretzels.

00:03:53.098 --> 00:03:54.767
Now, if you get an artisan
chocolate covered pretzel-

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.035 line:92%
That's what I'm talking about.

00:03:56.068 --> 00:03:57.870
I mean, next level when they
put, like, sea salt-

00:03:57.903 --> 00:03:59.105 line:92%
Oh, well you're just-

00:03:59.138 --> 00:04:01.007
-and caramel and chocolate and
stuff on it.

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.241 line:92%
-you're just hipster now.

00:04:02.275 --> 00:04:04.143
That's not hipster. That's a
good chocolate covered pretzel.

00:04:04.176 --> 00:04:07.280
Or, also, just go get
Flips, from the store!

00:04:07.313 --> 00:04:10.283
Yeah, Flips is the mainstream-
why don't we have people-

00:04:10.316 --> 00:04:12.985
why don't you and I go through
a couple people's catalogs

00:04:13.018 --> 00:04:14.487 line:92%
and just order candy for us

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:15.755
and the crew
out of listener's kids'

00:04:15.788 --> 00:04:17.089 line:78%
catalogs?

00:04:17.122 --> 00:04:18.391 line:83%
Because, they're sexually
harassing Jacob

00:04:18.424 --> 00:04:19.592 line:92%
at work right now.

00:04:19.625 --> 00:04:20.860 line:92%
Dude, look at you, Jacob.

00:04:20.893 --> 00:04:22.094
Touchin' his butt.
Look at-

00:04:22.127 --> 00:04:23.863
I definitely have my finger
in his butt crack.

00:04:23.896 --> 00:04:25.898
I definitely have my finger
in his butt crack!

00:04:25.931 --> 00:04:27.967
This can definitely get us
kicked off-a air.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.069
We are in dangerous territory
right now!

00:04:30.102 --> 00:04:32.571
Jacob, look at me,
do you

00:04:32.604 --> 00:04:34.273 line:92%
I'm touchin' his butt hole!

00:04:34.306 --> 00:04:35.508
Jacob, do you feel
uncomfortable?

00:04:35.541 --> 00:04:36.742 line:92%
A little...

00:04:36.775 --> 00:04:38.077 line:92%
Then Jay-

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:40.680
I will have your head, Jacob!
I'll have your job!

00:04:40.713 --> 00:04:42.448
You wanna keep working here
at Sirius, do ya?

00:04:42.481 --> 00:04:43.649 line:92%
Let me do it!

00:04:43.682 --> 00:04:44.884 line:92%
I just give back rubs.

00:04:44.917 --> 00:04:46.819 line:92%
Let me get in the action!

00:04:46.852 --> 00:04:49.522
Yeah, hey Jacob,
what if I told you

00:04:49.555 --> 00:04:51.557 line:92%
I like it when Jay touches you?

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:53.959
Lou, this is the stuff
you can't do

00:04:53.992 --> 00:04:56.028
when you go into
your inclusion class this week.

00:04:56.061 --> 00:04:58.231
Lou, let me show you
a couple-a "don't"s ...

00:05:03.135 --> 00:05:05.638 line:92%
Now, radio ...

00:05:05.671 --> 00:05:07.273 line:92%
Yeah, you're full haunched.

00:05:07.306 --> 00:05:10.242
... as a business-
oh, I'm wearing sweatpants, too.

00:05:10.275 --> 00:05:11.610 line:92%
It's touching!

00:05:11.643 --> 00:05:12.845
It's alright, Jacob.
I got these.

00:05:12.878 --> 00:05:14.413 line:92%
It's touching the material.

00:05:14.446 --> 00:05:17.116
I got these slate jeans
on that fit just right.

00:05:17.816 --> 00:05:19.285 line:92%
But they're so, oh-so fun

00:05:19.318 --> 00:05:20.519 line:92%
to piss off.

00:05:20.552 --> 00:05:21.754 line:92%
Man, these mi- frogs-

00:05:21.787 --> 00:05:23.422
these mint, fudge-filled frogs,
it's like burglary.

00:05:23.455 --> 00:05:24.824 line:92%
I can't even say it.

00:05:24.857 --> 00:05:26.058 line:92%
You're making your mouth water.

00:05:26.091 --> 00:05:27.259 line:92%
Yeah, I do. I'm going nuts.

00:05:27.292 --> 00:05:28.594 line:92%
They are generic-

00:05:28.627 --> 00:05:29.862
-What?
-shit candy!

00:05:29.895 --> 00:05:31.230 line:92%
Fuck you! Fuck you!

00:05:31.263 --> 00:05:32.498
-They are.
-Fuck you!

00:05:32.531 --> 00:05:34.300
They're shit! Look at the ratio
of mint to chocolate!

00:05:34.333 --> 00:05:35.501 line:92%
I know, it's so-

00:05:35.534 --> 00:05:37.136
You guys must be
eating frog mints!

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:39.705
When I bite into it,
I feel like I'm

00:05:39.738 --> 00:05:41.440 line:92%
luging

00:05:41.473 --> 00:05:42.675 line:92%
I'm in the alps.

00:05:42.708 --> 00:05:45.578
Oh, whenever I bite into a mint,
fudge frog-filled,

00:05:45.611 --> 00:05:46.846 line:92%
filled-fuck ... shit.

00:05:46.879 --> 00:05:48.748
Twelve dollars, I bet you get
ten of th- it's like-

00:05:48.781 --> 00:05:49.949 line:92%
You get twenty-four.

00:05:49.982 --> 00:05:51.484
By the way, you get charged-
you know the number?

00:05:51.517 --> 00:05:52.685 line:92%
Nah, I don't know the number.

00:05:52.718 --> 00:05:56.122
You get charged ...
minibar prices in those things.

00:05:56.155 --> 00:05:57.390 line:92%
Cool, bring it.

00:05:57.423 --> 00:05:58.858
You think you're gettin' a deal.
You're not.

00:05:58.891 --> 00:06:00.693
What do the kids get?
What do the kids get?

00:06:00.726 --> 00:06:02.027 line:92%
I'm doin' this for the kids!

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:04.130
Nothin'. All I learned
by these

00:06:04.163 --> 00:06:06.632
It's a pretty low percentage
of the profits

00:06:06.665 --> 00:06:08.367
you get to keep for any sorta
fundraising, actually.

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:09.602 line:92%
Yeah, bring it.

00:06:09.635 --> 00:06:10.870
Yeah, all I learned
from these things-

00:06:10.903 --> 00:06:11.804 line:92%
I stand by my word.

00:06:11.838 --> 00:06:12.972
is that I think
chocolate-covered cherries

00:06:13.005 --> 00:06:14.240 line:92%
are fucking gross.

00:06:14.273 --> 00:06:15.474
Yeah, they are gross.
And the first time I ate-

00:06:15.507 --> 00:06:16.709 line:92%
That's all I found out.

00:06:16.742 --> 00:06:18.444
The first time I ate it,
did you ever,

00:06:18.477 --> 00:06:22.314
when you were really little,
at your elementary school-

00:06:22.347 --> 00:06:23.783
well, I don't know
if yours did this,

00:06:23.816 --> 00:06:25.451
but mine, around Christmas,
they'd be like-

00:06:25.484 --> 00:06:26.685 line:92%
Is this a lot? Is this me, too?

00:06:26.718 --> 00:06:28.387 line:92%
Oh, Jacob, what ya doin' there?

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:29.655 line:92%
Is this me, too, here?

00:06:29.688 --> 00:06:31.123
You guys are just buddies,
palin' around.

00:06:31.156 --> 00:06:32.324 line:92%
Is this me, too?

00:06:32.357 --> 00:06:33.559 line:92%
It's fine.

00:06:33.592 --> 00:06:34.827 line:92%
I mean, that was nice. I guess.

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:36.228
He goes, "now, how 'bout here?
Do you trust me?"

00:06:36.261 --> 00:06:37.563 line:92%
Jacob's

00:06:37.596 --> 00:06:38.864 line:92%
Jacob, I want you to trust me.

00:06:38.897 --> 00:06:40.132 line:92%
Jacob's coming out of this

00:06:40.165 --> 00:06:42.301
like a scarred Abercrombie
and Fitch model.

00:06:43.235 --> 00:06:45.037
"He told me he would
put me on the bag

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:47.039
if I put his bag
in my mouth."

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:50.443 line:92%
You can't break Jacob's stride

00:06:50.476 --> 00:06:51.777
today.
We're all comin'-

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:53.012 line:92%
Aw, dude, he's all jacked.

00:06:53.045 --> 00:06:54.680
We're all comin'
to NASCAR Sunday.

00:06:54.713 --> 00:06:56.682
We're comin' over to Jacob's.
It'll be me

00:06:56.715 --> 00:06:58.651
Whitzke, me,
is Black Lou comin'?

00:06:58.684 --> 00:07:00.019
Black Lou's sick today,
so he's out.

00:07:00.052 --> 00:07:01.320 line:92%
He's not coming.

00:07:01.353 --> 00:07:02.922
He's not comin' on Sunday.
He's got, uh-

00:07:02.955 --> 00:07:04.123 line:92%
Oh, he's got a friends-giving.

00:07:04.156 --> 00:07:05.324 line:92%
Yeah, friends-giving.

00:07:05.357 --> 00:07:06.659 line:92%
But we'll all be there, Jacob!

00:07:06.692 --> 00:07:09.929
That coffee cake is about
to get the shit ate out of it.

00:07:09.962 --> 00:07:12.531
Yeah, I'm bringing back
Wawa stuff.

00:07:12.564 --> 00:07:13.833 line:92%
Oh, you got Wawa!

00:07:13.866 --> 00:07:15.301
You better hope to God
I don't order-

00:07:15.334 --> 00:07:17.203
I don't rock a mint,
fudge-filled frog

00:07:17.236 --> 00:07:18.938 line:92%
order in Winnipeg.

00:07:18.971 --> 00:07:20.806 line:92%
Sorry, guys, I'm too full on-

00:07:20.839 --> 00:07:25.644
Guys, I think I got sick from
the green dye and the frogs.

00:07:25.677 --> 00:07:27.513
It turns out
the outside's chalk.

00:07:27.546 --> 00:07:30.416
It's chal- I was eating stuff
that you could write with.

00:07:30.449 --> 00:07:31.917 line:92%
That's a low-quality candy, Dan.

00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:33.219
Okay, well,
you hurt my feelings.

00:07:33.252 --> 00:07:34.453 line:92%
It really is.

00:07:34.486 --> 00:07:36.055
But, you don't like mint
chocolate at all.

00:07:36.088 --> 00:07:38.524
I would think those are
delicious and really exciting,

00:07:38.557 --> 00:07:40.125
but you don't like
mint chocolate.

00:07:40.158 --> 00:07:42.695 line:92%
She just piled on. Let her talk.

00:07:42.728 --> 00:07:44.296
Nothing she says
makes any sense.

00:07:44.329 --> 00:07:46.532
She said because you don't
like mint chocolate!

00:07:46.565 --> 00:07:48.267 line:92%
I mean, mint chocolate chips,

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:49.869
literally one of
my favorite ice creams!

00:07:49.902 --> 00:07:51.303 line:92%
God, I knew I loved you.

00:07:51.336 --> 00:07:52.505 line:92%
I- wh- like, what?

00:07:52.538 --> 00:07:53.839 line:92%
You ever had Mediterranean mint?

00:07:53.872 --> 00:07:55.808
Hang on, I'm gonna throw
a hot chocolate on her.

00:07:55.841 --> 00:07:57.109 line:92%
Is that bad?

00:07:57.142 --> 00:07:58.344 line:92%
Yeah!

00:07:58.377 --> 00:07:59.645
Lou, did you go
to your training yet?

00:07:59.678 --> 00:08:00.946 line:92%
Is this bad yet?

00:08:00.979 --> 00:08:02.515 line:92%
I didn't go so go ahead.

00:08:02.548 --> 00:08:03.782 line:92%
All bets are off!

00:08:03.815 --> 00:08:04.984 line:92%
You're back in the game, Lou,

00:08:05.017 --> 00:08:06.652
and you haven't gone
to sensitivity training yet?

00:08:06.685 --> 00:08:07.853 line:92%
No, tomorrow.

00:08:07.886 --> 00:08:10.189
Oh, that's when they fuckin'
put you in the ...

00:08:10.222 --> 00:08:13.192 line:92%
it's back.

00:08:13.759 --> 00:08:15.961
Lay back, we're gonna
plug you into the Matrix,

00:08:15.994 --> 00:08:17.530 line:92%
the woke Matrix.

00:08:17.563 --> 00:08:19.598 line:92%
You're gonna be so woke, Lou.

00:08:19.631 --> 00:08:20.900 line:92%
Wake him up!

00:08:20.933 --> 00:08:22.735
I can't.
Jacob, you went already, right?

00:08:22.768 --> 00:08:23.936 line:92%
"I teach it."

00:08:23.969 --> 00:08:25.704
You already went to sensitivity-
"Yes, I ran it."

00:08:25.737 --> 00:08:27.239
I know how to act.
I know how to behave.

00:08:27.272 --> 00:08:28.474 line:92%
You do now!

00:08:28.507 --> 00:08:30.476
Yeah, you do.
Jay set you straight.

00:08:30.509 --> 00:08:34.413
"Uh oh, I think I dropped
my papers, again!"

00:08:34.446 --> 00:08:36.749
Jacob, stop it. Can you stop it,
Jacob?

00:08:36.782 --> 00:08:38.817
I'm the only guy
who could fuck this girl.

00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:40.185 line:92%
Everyone's a fuckin' (bleep)

00:08:40.218 --> 00:08:41.554
I mean, Christine had-a
pepper spray him

00:08:41.587 --> 00:08:44.089
six times in the first year.
It was a lot! It was a lot.

00:08:44.122 --> 00:08:45.324 line:92%
But he learned! He does learn.

00:08:45.357 --> 00:08:46.525 line:92%
It was a lot.

00:08:46.558 --> 00:08:48.494
He does learn, though.
And that's what's good.

00:08:48.527 --> 00:08:51.196
Lou, I'm gonna miss you.
I'm gonna miss old

00:08:51.229 --> 00:08:55.267
Mets-hat, gettin' half-cocked
on a show Whitzke

00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:57.136
Yeah, they don't test you
to find out

00:08:57.169 --> 00:09:01.373
if you can't possibly abide by
these rules and fire you, right?

00:09:01.406 --> 00:09:03.142
No, everybody had
to go through it-

00:09:03.175 --> 00:09:04.977
You can go fake it enough
and then, get through it.

00:09:05.010 --> 00:09:06.211 line:92%
Hell, yeah.

00:09:06.245 --> 00:09:08.180
But you don't have to answer
questions to get a score, right?

00:09:08.213 --> 00:09:09.615
You don't wanna find out
that you're like a C

00:09:09.648 --> 00:09:10.816 line:92%
in sexual harassing.

00:09:10.849 --> 00:09:12.251 line:92%
Yeah

00:09:12.284 --> 00:09:13.686
You're a D at racism
or something.

00:09:13.719 --> 00:09:16.589
He goes, "but B plus
at sharing workspaces."

00:09:16.622 --> 00:09:19.058
Yeah, I am very good
at sharing workspaces.

00:09:19.091 --> 00:09:20.960
There's exercises and stuff
I think you get scored-

00:09:20.993 --> 00:09:22.261 line:92%
Good exercise.

00:09:22.294 --> 00:09:24.363
Do you have to hold hands with
a black person for five minutes?

00:09:24.396 --> 00:09:25.731
Is it like
the Coast Guard training

00:09:25.764 --> 00:09:26.966 line:92%
where you have to tread water?

00:09:26.999 --> 00:09:28.701
Can you take notes of the things
they make you do?

00:09:28.734 --> 00:09:29.935 line:92%
Oh, totally.

00:09:29.968 --> 00:09:31.437
Yes, and then,
we can do 'em on the show.

00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:34.607
Well, Jacob knows!
I wanna know what he's in for.

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:36.408 line:92%
My best friend is a black guy!

00:09:36.441 --> 00:09:37.643 line:92%
Jacob's taking bets right now.

00:09:37.676 --> 00:09:39.278
Jacob's going,
"okay, how are you doing?

00:09:39.311 --> 00:09:40.512 line:92%
Fudge frogs?

00:09:40.545 --> 00:09:42.615
Yeah, I got that
at plus three and a half."

00:09:42.648 --> 00:09:43.916 line:92%
You wanna parlay it?

00:09:43.949 --> 00:09:47.620
"Alright, so Stealers, are you
gonna go money line? Fantastic!"

00:09:47.653 --> 00:09:50.656
I go, "I think Jacob's
running a bookie

00:09:50.689 --> 00:09:52.792 line:92%
fucking gig out of our studio."

00:09:54.126 --> 00:09:55.561
Bet- alright,
you've reached BetTot.com.

00:09:55.594 --> 00:09:56.862 line:92%
Bet Tot, alright-

00:09:56.895 --> 00:09:58.130 line:92%
Bet Tot!

00:09:58.163 --> 00:09:59.665
Give me the best prices
on the internet.

00:09:59.698 --> 00:10:02.101
You want the Timberwolves
to cover?

00:10:02.134 --> 00:10:04.169 line:92%
Ah, you're a bettin' man, huh?

00:10:04.202 --> 00:10:08.507
Alright, so it's 150 to win 100,
you're cool with that?

00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:10.943 line:76%
There is no vig.
I'm not gonna cut you in on it.

00:10:11.977 --> 00:10:14.947
Three team parlay, someone's
stepping up with some nuts ...

00:10:17.349 --> 00:10:22.921
Any calls about me buying fudge
-filled frogs out of catalogs?

00:10:22.954 --> 00:10:25.491
You told 'em to email you
the catalog, in fairness.

00:10:25.524 --> 00:10:28.027
I didn't say email me it.
I said "reach out."

00:10:28.527 --> 00:10:29.928 line:92%
No, man, I think you said email.

00:10:29.961 --> 00:10:31.664
-You said "write."
-I said write?

00:10:32.931 --> 00:10:34.333
Now, you want
a hand-written note.

00:10:34.366 --> 00:10:37.903
And send me the catalog
with a self-addressed

00:10:37.936 --> 00:10:39.672
a self-addressed,
stamped envelope,

00:10:39.705 --> 00:10:41.040 line:92%
and we will mail it back to-

00:10:41.073 --> 00:10:43.409
Or that thing ain't comin' back.
It will be filled out.

00:10:43.442 --> 00:10:45.044
You want to live here?
You wanna live here?

00:10:45.077 --> 00:10:47.112
I'll keep my money, and you'll
keep your stupid mint bears.

00:10:47.145 --> 00:10:48.714
And I'll poop looking
at your catalog

00:10:48.747 --> 00:10:50.115 line:92%
for the next three months.

00:10:50.148 --> 00:10:53.619
I feel like the boy in you
just wants to eat little frogs.

00:10:53.652 --> 00:10:55.020 line:92%
I do, goddamn right.

00:10:55.053 --> 00:10:57.556
I think you like the shape!
I think you think an Andes

00:10:57.589 --> 00:10:59.992
Candies is an old-timey
like owning a Buick

00:11:00.025 --> 00:11:01.460 line:92%
or something.

00:11:01.493 --> 00:11:02.695 line:92%
I love it. You know why?

00:11:02.728 --> 00:11:05.064
'Cause I was never allowed
to buy the candies

00:11:05.097 --> 00:11:06.665 line:92%
when I was a kid.

00:11:06.698 --> 00:11:07.900
-Ever?
-Ever.

00:11:07.933 --> 00:11:11.770 line:92%
So do you hate old people candy?

00:11:11.803 --> 00:11:13.105
Yeah.
One of my least favorite-

00:11:13.138 --> 00:11:15.107
I like Worther's originals
like a mother fucker.

00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:18.177
How about the caramel
that had a bard of cream

00:11:18.210 --> 00:11:19.411 line:92%
in the middle of it?

00:11:19.444 --> 00:11:20.646 line:92%
Oh, that was gross.

00:11:20.679 --> 00:11:21.880 line:92%
What is that cream?

00:11:21.913 --> 00:11:23.849
Did your dentist used
to hang out-

00:11:23.882 --> 00:11:26.118
my dentist would hand out candy
which just seems-

00:11:26.151 --> 00:11:27.352
it feeds itself.
It's smart.

00:11:27.385 --> 00:11:28.586 line:92%
That's how it starts.

00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:31.590
Yeah, but the strawberries that
are in the strawberry thing,

00:11:31.623 --> 00:11:33.258
it's like a lozenge,
but then, it's chewy.

00:11:33.291 --> 00:11:34.660
-Yeah.
-Those are the best!

00:11:34.693 --> 00:11:35.928 line:92%
I love those.

00:11:35.961 --> 00:11:37.162 line:92%
Really?

00:11:37.195 --> 00:11:38.898 line:92%
Love 'em, fucking love 'em!

00:11:39.564 --> 00:11:41.667
They turn into little pieces
of glass in your mouth, though.

00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:42.901 line:92%
I know! It's so

00:11:42.934 --> 00:11:44.470 line:92%
It's little glass shards!

00:11:44.503 --> 00:11:46.205
The candy is wrapped
in a picture

00:11:46.238 --> 00:11:47.706
of what the candy's
gonna be like.

00:11:47.739 --> 00:11:49.442 line:92%
Yeah, it's a strawberry.

00:11:49.975 --> 00:11:51.143 line:92%
You like those?

00:11:51.176 --> 00:11:52.344 line:92%
Love 'em!

00:11:52.377 --> 00:11:54.513
Those are real waitin'
for your grandma

00:11:54.546 --> 00:11:56.315
to finish visiting
with your aunt-

00:11:56.348 --> 00:11:57.716
-Yeah.
-candy.

00:11:57.749 --> 00:11:59.051 line:92%
Yeah, it's dentist office shit.

00:11:59.084 --> 00:12:00.385 line:92%
I like an Andes Candy.

00:12:00.418 --> 00:12:01.687 line:92%
Yeah, those!

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:03.055
I like an Andes Candy-
oh, those are gross.

00:12:03.088 --> 00:12:04.656 line:92%
What are those called?

00:12:04.689 --> 00:12:06.725 line:92%
The Strawberry Candies.

00:12:06.758 --> 00:12:07.960 line:92%
Strawberry Candies.

00:12:07.993 --> 00:12:09.361
I mean, what else
could you possibly call that?

00:12:09.394 --> 00:12:10.596 line:92%
I love 'em.

00:12:10.629 --> 00:12:13.365
And you could probably
buy 40,000 for a dollar.

00:12:14.599 --> 00:12:16.668
You own the company
if you buy ten dollars worth!

00:12:16.701 --> 00:12:18.237
You definitely own half of it
if you spend ten bucks!

00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:19.471 line:92%
Yeah.

00:12:19.504 --> 00:12:20.839
You 
but the best-

00:12:20.872 --> 00:12:22.374 line:92%
Four dollars for a pound!

00:12:22.407 --> 00:12:26.678
A pound of those
soulless candies?

00:12:26.711 --> 00:12:28.380
Stop saying soulless
'cause they're not soulless

00:12:28.413 --> 00:12:29.882
'cause they're-
at first

00:12:29.915 --> 00:12:31.116
Dude, they're almost hollow!
The pound-

00:12:31.149 --> 00:12:32.484
dude, there's gonna be-
you don't have enough room!

00:12:32.517 --> 00:12:33.685 line:92%
It's chewy on the inside.

00:12:33.718 --> 00:12:35.120 line:92%
You'd have to kick out

00:12:35.153 --> 00:12:36.421 line:92%
Bye, Mike. Bye, bitch!

00:12:36.454 --> 00:12:39.358
Bye, bitch! Bye, bitch.
Bye, bitch.

00:12:39.391 --> 00:12:40.726 line:92%
Bye, bitch.

00:12:40.759 --> 00:12:42.294
Strawberry candy-
Strawberry!

00:12:42.327 --> 00:12:43.495
-for my-
Hard.

00:12:43.528 --> 00:12:44.730 line:92%
-roommate! Hi, bitch.

00:12:44.763 --> 00:12:45.964
Hard!
Bye, bitch!

00:12:45.997 --> 00:12:48.200 line:92%
Chewy. Bye, bitch. Bye, bitch.

00:12:48.233 --> 00:12:49.868
Yeah, dude, I'll fuckin'
buy the shit outta-

00:12:49.901 --> 00:12:51.103 line:92%
Aw, they look so unappetizing.

00:12:51.136 --> 00:12:52.805
Man, you really like
gross-looking shit.

00:12:52.838 --> 00:12:54.006 line:92%
Hey, man ...

00:12:54.039 --> 00:12:56.475
Yeah, I'm not lying.
Don't you like a macaroon?

00:12:56.508 --> 00:12:57.743 line:92%
What are you?

00:12:57.776 --> 00:12:59.711
How is your favorite thing not
like a macaroon or something?

00:12:59.744 --> 00:13:00.979
Do you just like
saying macaroon?

00:13:01.012 --> 00:13:02.247 line:92%
It's a great word!

00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:03.482 line:92%
Macaroon.

00:13:03.515 --> 00:13:04.716 line:92%
You know you love macaroons.

00:13:04.749 --> 00:13:05.918 line:92%
I don't like macaroons.

00:13:05.951 --> 00:13:07.953
Come on, why, you not like
coconut anymore?

00:13:07.986 --> 00:13:09.221 line:92%
Are you still a child?

00:13:09.254 --> 00:13:10.756
Do you think olives are gross
and coconut's bad?

00:13:10.789 --> 00:13:11.957 line:92%
No, I love coconut.

00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:13.425
Olives are gross,
but I love Mounds.

00:13:13.458 --> 00:13:14.660 line:92%
No olives you like?

00:13:14.693 --> 00:13:16.228 line:92%
I don't like any olives?

00:13:16.261 --> 00:13:18.530
Would you try some olives for me
to prove you're an adult?

00:13:18.563 --> 00:13:19.965
Because I, also-
I've tried it!

00:13:19.998 --> 00:13:21.667
-I never liked olives.
-Okay.

00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:24.336
But there's some olives, dude,
you can d- like a black olive.

00:13:24.369 --> 00:13:25.604 line:92%
Just a straight, black olive is-

00:13:25.637 --> 00:13:27.539
No, no, no, no, no, no, no-
-gross. With these on pizza-

00:13:27.572 --> 00:13:28.740 line:92%
Yeah, I hate it.

00:13:28.773 --> 00:13:30.776
-with Kalamala olives ...
Kalamata?

00:13:30.809 --> 00:13:31.977 line:92%
Kalamata.

00:13:32.010 --> 00:13:33.245
Fuckin'-
I'll tell you this-

00:13:33.278 --> 00:13:34.446 line:92%
You could eat a jar of those.

00:13:34.479 --> 00:13:36.048
I'll tell you this.
How about this?

00:13:36.081 --> 00:13:39.351
Jay Oakerson, this Sunday,
at 

00:13:39.384 --> 00:13:42.120
why don't you bring over
some olives, and I'll try 'em.

00:13:42.153 --> 00:13:44.022
You get a good feta-stuffed
green?

00:13:44.055 --> 00:13:47.292
Yeah. I've never been there,
but I'm willing to go.

00:13:47.325 --> 00:13:50.095
I'm talkin' about
eatin' olives, yeah.

00:13:50.762 --> 00:13:53.198 line:92%
Pit or no pit, I'm here for it.

00:13:53.231 --> 00:13:55.634
Dan, am I being "me too"'d
right now? Is this me, too?

00:13:55.667 --> 00:13:58.437
No. Oh, now, you don't like it
because you can't harass Jacob.

00:13:58.470 --> 00:13:59.771 line:92%
What's happening?

00:13:59.804 --> 00:14:01.340
This is what happens
when your power is taken away.

00:14:01.373 --> 00:14:03.342
This is what happens
when the patriarchy crumbles.

00:14:03.375 --> 00:14:04.576
-I feel defenseless.
-Good.

00:14:04.609 --> 00:14:05.844 line:92%
And I feel ...

00:14:05.877 --> 00:14:07.079
Good. Um-
Good.

00:14:07.112 --> 00:14:08.814
No one's writing in.
No one's writing in about the-

00:14:08.847 --> 00:14:10.048
Man, you really want
these things, Dan.

00:14:10.081 --> 00:14:11.316
I'm sure you could get 'em.
They're-

00:14:11.349 --> 00:14:12.551 line:92%
I'm gonna pull the trigger.

00:14:12.584 --> 00:14:13.752
That was a line.
We could order online.

00:14:13.785 --> 00:14:14.953 line:92%
They were twelve dollars.

00:14:14.986 --> 00:14:16.321
I know, but I wanna
help someone out.

00:14:16.354 --> 00:14:19.058
For twenty-four bite-sized
candies.

00:14:19.925 --> 00:14:21.693
You're overspending money
on that.

00:14:21.726 --> 00:14:24.029
Maybe, I'll be out on the range
at Red Dead Redemption,

00:14:24.062 --> 00:14:25.831
eatin' some fredge fogs-
fudge frogs.

00:14:25.864 --> 00:14:27.266
Of course, I wish
that game hit me

00:14:27.299 --> 00:14:28.967
in any level
that it's hit you on.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.403
-I love it.
-I know. It's just- I can't-

00:14:31.436 --> 00:14:32.604 line:92%
You gotta get into it!

00:14:32.637 --> 00:14:33.805 line:92%
Dude, I'm so busy.

00:14:33.838 --> 00:14:36.875
So are you, how do you also live
a full cowboy's life?

00:14:36.908 --> 00:14:39.044
I don't sleep, dude.
I sleep on the range.

00:14:40.245 --> 00:14:41.446 line:92%
I'll sleep when I'm dead!

00:14:41.479 --> 00:14:43.315 line:92%
I sleep when I

00:14:43.348 --> 00:14:44.516 line:92%
Thank you so much, man.

00:14:44.549 --> 00:14:45.751
Yeah.
I appreciate it.

00:14:45.784 --> 00:14:47.886
I hope you're reporting that
"me too" we had just now.

00:14:47.919 --> 00:14:49.087 line:92%
No, dude.

00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:50.656
That molesting moment
you just did to me,

00:14:50.689 --> 00:14:53.058
I'm gonna let that go because
you fixed everything fine.

00:14:53.091 --> 00:14:54.793
Well, in his defense,
we have it on camera,

00:14:54.826 --> 00:14:56.828 line:92%
so, counter sue, buddy.

00:14:56.861 --> 00:14:59.264
Next time, work both nips.
You gotta even out, man.

00:14:59.297 --> 00:15:01.066 line:92%
Sorry, you're right

00:15:04.569 --> 00:15:05.771 line:92%
Get the tapes.

00:15:05.804 --> 00:15:07.039 line:92%
Get the tapes right now.

00:15:07.072 --> 00:15:08.874
We got the tapes.
Erase everything you saw.

00:15:08.907 --> 00:15:10.542
We're gonna take this case
all the way to the top.

00:15:10.575 --> 00:15:12.244 line:92%
Christine, do a rape kit on me.

00:15:12.277 --> 00:15:13.612 line:92%
Do it, now.

00:15:13.645 --> 00:15:15.547
We'll take him down and all
of his engineering buddies.

00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:16.815 line:92%
We'll run this place.

00:15:16.848 --> 00:15:18.717
Dude, rape kit me.
I'm trying to get another candy

00:15:18.750 --> 00:15:21.353
that I thought was just heinous
that I bet you like.

00:15:21.386 --> 00:15:23.689 line:92%
Fuck you!

00:15:23.722 --> 00:15:25.557
My grandfather used to have
Mary Janes,

00:15:25.590 --> 00:15:28.060
but I mean, I couldn't think of
any other reason to eat

00:15:28.093 --> 00:15:29.695
those than you're gonna
take your teeth out.

00:15:29.728 --> 00:15:31.430
What about those root
beer barrels?

00:15:31.463 --> 00:15:32.831
Those hard candy
root beer barrels?

00:15:32.864 --> 00:15:34.099
I'm okay with the root
beer barrel.

00:15:34.132 --> 00:15:35.934
Didn't hate it
but I didn't love it.

00:15:35.967 --> 00:15:37.469 line:92%
Do you remember Mary Janes?

00:15:37.502 --> 00:15:39.604
I don't even know
what those are.

00:15:39.637 --> 00:15:44.009
I mean, they are- it's supposed
to be like taffy consistency,

00:15:44.042 --> 00:15:45.243 line:92%
but it's the hardest-

00:15:45.276 --> 00:15:46.845 line:92%
Did you like Now And Laters?

00:15:46.878 --> 00:15:48.080 line:92%
No, it's like a Now and Later!

00:15:48.113 --> 00:15:49.314
I didn't like
Now and Laters either.

00:15:49.347 --> 00:15:51.116
-Because, yeah-
-Oh, I love these!

00:15:51.149 --> 00:15:55.621 line:92%
four dollars a pound!

00:15:56.454 --> 00:15:58.490 line:92%
Hell, yeah! I remember these.

00:15:58.523 --> 00:16:00.392
Dude, there's no way you're
not gonna lose it a tooth.

00:16:00.425 --> 00:16:02.027
You get a crown, dude,
it's comin' out.

00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:06.331
Oh, I loved Mary Janes!
Yeah, hell, yeah!

00:16:06.364 --> 00:16:07.632 line:92%
If you have any dental work-

00:16:07.665 --> 00:16:08.900 line:92%
Do you like Sugar Babies?

00:16:08.933 --> 00:16:10.102 line:92%
-it's coming out!

00:16:10.135 --> 00:16:11.336 line:92%
Did you like Sugar Babies?

00:16:11.369 --> 00:16:12.971
Love Sugar Babies.
Milk Duds?

00:16:13.004 --> 00:16:14.172
But I'll tell you what,
I like Sugar

00:16:14.205 --> 00:16:15.941
Babies, but I like
a Sugar Daddy.

00:16:15.974 --> 00:16:17.142 line:92%
I like a Sugar Daddy, too.

00:16:17.175 --> 00:16:18.543
I'll live it on the stick.
I don't give a shit.

00:16:18.576 --> 00:16:20.812
Yeah, I'll put it
on the side of my mouth.

00:16:20.845 --> 00:16:22.581
I'll tell you what different
times of the year

00:16:22.614 --> 00:16:26.651
its overrated on Halloween,
but the rest of the year,

00:16:26.684 --> 00:16:28.653
I think is a little underrated,
is a Tootsie Roll.

00:16:28.686 --> 00:16:29.921 line:92%
Oh, yeah.

00:16:29.954 --> 00:16:33.158
But they give it out too much on
Halloween, and you're over it.

00:16:33.191 --> 00:16:36.595
Oh, Girl Scout Samoas, Garth
or something tweeting at it.

00:16:36.628 --> 00:16:38.096
Yeah, dude, fuck mint,
fudge-filled frogs

00:16:38.129 --> 00:16:39.364 line:92%
for

00:16:39.397 --> 00:16:40.599 line:92%
No, Garth, you're right.

00:16:40.632 --> 00:16:42.401
Fuck those mint-filled,
fudge frogs.

00:16:42.434 --> 00:16:44.669
They are insanely-
they're cheap. It's shitty.

00:16:44.702 --> 00:16:47.105
No, I'm not- listen, we can live
in a world

00:16:47.138 --> 00:16:48.407 line:92%
with Samoas and fudge-

00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:49.641
-Do you love Samoas?
-Love 'em!

00:16:49.674 --> 00:16:50.876
Do you love 'em?
Love 'em!

00:16:50.909 --> 00:16:52.110 line:92%
Then you love macaroons!

00:16:52.143 --> 00:16:53.378
I don't know
if I can keep doing this show

00:16:53.411 --> 00:16:54.880
if the guy's gonna look me right
in the face and tell me lies.

00:16:54.913 --> 00:16:56.181
I don't like macaroons.
I love you to death.

00:16:56.214 --> 00:16:57.415 line:92%
I thought macaroons-

00:16:57.449 --> 00:16:59.384
I wanna be with you the rest
of my life, but we need honesty.

00:16:59.417 --> 00:17:01.420
I think, honestly, I don't know
what macaroons are.

00:17:01.453 --> 00:17:03.488
You know what?
There's two kinds of macaroons.

00:17:03.521 --> 00:17:06.558
Well, I mean, then what's
all this slander online?

00:17:06.591 --> 00:17:09.261
In fairness- baby,
you know I ca-

00:17:09.294 --> 00:17:10.495 line:92%
No, I wanna call Dr.Phil.

00:17:10.528 --> 00:17:11.730 line:92%
I'm gonna change, though!

00:17:11.763 --> 00:17:13.832
I'mma key your car!
I'm outta my mind!

00:17:13.865 --> 00:17:15.067 line:92%
I'm outta my mind!

00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:17.636
Tag-Alongs and Samoas
are the two best.

00:17:17.669 --> 00:17:18.904
But there's two kinds
of macaroons.

00:17:18.937 --> 00:17:20.138 line:92%
The one I'm talking about-

00:17:20.171 --> 00:17:21.440
I'm talking about
the Girl Scout cookies.

00:17:21.473 --> 00:17:22.774 line:92%
Yeah those are-

00:17:22.807 --> 00:17:24.042 line:92%
No! Those ones I hate!

00:17:24.075 --> 00:17:26.344
Those ones look grotesque to me.
I don't even know what that is.

00:17:26.377 --> 00:17:27.879
That's what I thought
a macaroon was. That's why

00:17:27.912 --> 00:17:29.915 line:92%
you're yelling at me.

00:17:29.948 --> 00:17:31.583
But look at what I mean
a macaroon is.

00:17:31.616 --> 00:17:32.784 line:92%
Man, you're a macaroon.

00:17:32.817 --> 00:17:34.986
Christine might masturbate
to this picture.

00:17:35.019 --> 00:17:36.388
I've made her really
grow to love ma-

00:17:36.421 --> 00:17:37.656
well'd you always
love macaroons?

00:17:37.689 --> 00:17:39.257 line:92%
No, I hate coconut.

00:17:39.290 --> 00:17:41.226
Oh, I've had
chocolate-covered macaroons!

00:17:41.259 --> 00:17:42.494
Yes!
They're great!

00:17:42.527 --> 00:17:44.229 line:92%
Those are what's up.

00:17:44.262 --> 00:17:46.298
I didn't know those
were macaroons. I'm dumb.

00:17:46.331 --> 00:17:47.732
Yeah. Oh, there, show 'em
the picture

00:17:47.765 --> 00:17:49.768
of the chocolate ones.
All the way on the left.

00:17:49.801 --> 00:17:51.036
-Oh, yeah!
-I mean that's-

00:17:51.069 --> 00:17:52.404
Yeah.
Just the best.

00:17:52.437 --> 00:17:53.638 line:92%
Yeah!

00:17:53.671 --> 00:17:54.873
But that's a taste, also,
when I was younger-

00:17:54.906 --> 00:17:56.475
I don't like the circular,
small sandwich ones.

00:17:56.508 --> 00:17:57.843
No, I don't even know
what that is.

00:17:57.876 --> 00:17:59.077 line:92%
But, I've seen 'em,

00:17:59.110 --> 00:18:01.546
I just don't know what they
even taste like or anything.

00:18:01.579 --> 00:18:05.150
But that's a flavor though, too,
when I was young, hated coconut.

00:18:05.183 --> 00:18:06.418 line:92%
Yeah!

00:18:06.451 --> 00:18:09.054
The idea of coconut- the only
one that hasn't changed for me,

00:18:09.087 --> 00:18:10.255
the two flavors
that haven't changed

00:18:10.288 --> 00:18:13.825
that I just can't stomach at all
is coffee, black licorice.

00:18:13.858 --> 00:18:15.460 line:92%
You don't like coffee?

00:18:15.493 --> 00:18:19.965
No, the flavor alo- can you do
an impression of what I do

00:18:19.998 --> 00:18:22.568
when I get a little coffee
in my mouth by accident?

00:18:23.434 --> 00:18:25.137 line:92%
... No, no I go-

00:18:28.139 --> 00:18:31.543
Oh, that's great!
Watching you eat mushrooms

00:18:31.576 --> 00:18:33.011
at Bonnaroo was funny
because you were like-

00:18:33.044 --> 00:18:35.814
Same thing, I hate it.
I hate it,

00:18:35.847 --> 00:18:38.316
so I'll tear sometimes, I tear
up.

00:18:38.349 --> 00:18:40.552
It's so funny 'cause I'm
the opposite where I'm like-

00:18:40.585 --> 00:18:41.786
Me too!
Gone, it's gone.

00:18:41.819 --> 00:18:43.688
So is Christine! She eats
them like they're

00:18:43.721 --> 00:18:45.757
she eats them
like they're good!

00:18:46.524 --> 00:18:50.095
It's like we're eating stuff
we found in tire treads.

00:18:50.128 --> 00:18:51.930
When I started doing
mushrooms in high school,

00:18:51.963 --> 00:18:53.665 line:92%
and I went to college-

00:18:54.199 --> 00:18:56.234
I gag thinking about
how awful that is, man.

00:18:56.267 --> 00:18:57.669
But people are like oh-
God damn.

00:18:57.702 --> 00:19:00.205
-I like to take a bagel
and put peanut butter

00:19:00.238 --> 00:19:01.473
then I put the mushrooms
on it

00:19:01.506 --> 00:19:03.141
then I'm like just
fucking eat the mushrooms.

00:19:03.174 --> 00:19:04.376 line:92%
Oh, yeah, don't be a child.

00:19:04.409 --> 00:19:08.079
Just fucking chew 'em up,
have a soda, knock 'em back.

00:19:08.112 --> 00:19:09.381 line:92%
Go shake hands with God.

00:19:09.414 --> 00:19:12.484
G-man in Virginia says
ribbon candy

00:19:13.351 --> 00:19:14.886
was like a old-
what was Ribbon Candy?

00:19:14.919 --> 00:19:16.254
I've had that, I mean,
those are-

00:19:16.287 --> 00:19:17.455
That's like Fruit
By The Foot, right?

00:19:17.488 --> 00:19:19.224
Yeah.
Basically, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:19:20.892 --> 00:19:22.727 line:92%
Fruit By The Foot is the shit.

00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:25.497
G-man, is that what you mean?
Like Fruit By The Foot?

00:19:25.530 --> 00:19:26.765 line:92%
Well, that's gum isn't it?

00:19:26.798 --> 00:19:28.633 line:71%
No, it's a hard candy.

00:19:28.666 --> 00:19:29.868 line:92%
Oh!

00:19:29.901 --> 00:19:31.570
Oh, a hard candy
called Ribbon Candy?

00:19:31.603 --> 00:19:32.871 line:92%
Hard candy called Ribbon-

00:19:32.904 --> 00:19:34.105 line:78%
Candy

00:19:34.138 --> 00:19:36.074 line:83%
It's the most disgustingest
shit my grandma

00:19:36.107 --> 00:19:38.310 line:76%
used to keep year-round
on her coffee table.

00:19:38.343 --> 00:19:40.445
Aw, man, I mean, I think
we're all in agreement

00:19:40.478 --> 00:19:42.047
the best grandma candy
was Worther's originals.

00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:43.248 line:92%
Those butterscotch things-

00:19:43.281 --> 00:19:44.916
I'll tell you what, anything
butterscotch, I'm on board.

00:19:44.949 --> 00:19:47.819
Butterscotch is just fucking
fan- good job, butterscotch.

00:19:47.852 --> 00:19:49.120 line:92%
Good job. Good job

00:19:49.153 --> 00:19:51.823
Tastykake for recognizing
making their flagship cake

00:19:51.856 --> 00:19:53.559 line:92%
the butterscotch crumpet.

00:19:54.192 --> 00:19:57.062
That's such a hard knowledge
of Tastykake!

00:19:57.095 --> 00:19:59.497
I know Entenmann's. I am from
the school of Entenmann's.

00:19:59.530 --> 00:20:00.832
What's Entenmann's
flagship thing?

00:20:00.865 --> 00:20:02.133 line:92%
We all know.

00:20:02.166 --> 00:20:03.368 line:92%
Yeah.

00:20:03.401 --> 00:20:05.170
Come on, what is it?
Say it with me if you know.

00:20:05.203 --> 00:20:06.371
-Powdered donut.
-Coffee cake?

00:20:06.404 --> 00:20:08.506
Powdered donut is
the quintessential Entenmann's?

00:20:08.539 --> 00:20:09.808 line:92%
It's the chocolate donut!

00:20:09.841 --> 00:20:11.443
Yeah, with the yellow cake
on the inside.

00:20:11.476 --> 00:20:12.811 line:92%
With the yellow on the inside!

00:20:12.844 --> 00:20:14.079
Yeah, yellow cake,
chocolate donut.

00:20:14.112 --> 00:20:15.914
I mean,
I'm a powdered donut guy.

00:20:15.947 --> 00:20:17.482
I'm Sunni.
You're Shiite. It's alright.

00:20:17.515 --> 00:20:19.684
I'm not saying that
butterscotch crumpets

00:20:19.717 --> 00:20:22.053
are my favorite
Tastykake, even.

00:20:22.086 --> 00:20:24.089
I'm just saying
that's their flagship thing.

00:20:24.122 --> 00:20:26.625
It's the most unique thing
of their original-

00:20:26.658 --> 00:20:29.761
Hostess is- what?- the cupcakes
with swirls and the Twinkies?

00:20:29.794 --> 00:20:31.029 line:92%
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:20:31.062 --> 00:20:32.897
HoHos?
Hostess is HoHos, also.

00:20:32.930 --> 00:20:35.500
I mean, Little Debbie you got
the Swiss Rolls, man this is-

00:20:35.533 --> 00:20:38.203
I'd go HoHo over a Swiss Roll,
every day of the week.

00:20:38.236 --> 00:20:39.971
-Really?
-Every day of the week.

00:20:40.004 --> 00:20:42.440
I'd go Swiss Roll!
I'm team Swiss Roll over here.

00:20:42.473 --> 00:20:45.210
I love a Swiss Roll.
That was one of the only- man,

00:20:45.243 --> 00:20:48.146
my mom loaded up on snacks.
We had a good snack cabinet;

00:20:48.179 --> 00:20:51.683
Fruit By The Foot,
Gushers, Swiss Rolls.

00:20:51.716 --> 00:20:55.053
Hell, yeah. They couldn't
do that in my house.

00:20:55.086 --> 00:20:56.421
I had a problem
with all those things.

00:20:56.454 --> 00:20:58.356
I was like to have it
for lunch and dinner.

00:20:58.389 --> 00:20:59.624 line:92%
Oh, yeah.

00:20:59.657 --> 00:21:02.661 line:92%
You were busy being athletic.

00:21:02.694 --> 00:21:04.029 line:92%
Oh, I wasn't athletic at all.

00:21:04.062 --> 00:21:06.464
I was busy fucking smoking butts
and playing with wrestling toys.

00:21:06.497 --> 00:21:09.067
I was eating while doing voices
for my G.I. Joes.

00:21:10.201 --> 00:21:12.471
Oh, I was outside ripping out
Marlboro going,

00:21:13.004 --> 00:21:14.439
"I think I'm gonna
have papa Shaun go

00:21:14.472 --> 00:21:16.274 line:92%
Undertaker."

00:21:16.307 --> 00:21:17.909
I wonder what my guys
are doin' right now.

00:21:17.942 --> 00:21:19.577 line:92%
You think my guys are beat up?

00:21:19.610 --> 00:21:21.513
That was a pretty wicked
Royal Rumble.
