00:00:04.158 --> 00:00:08.121
Voiceover: D. W. Griffith was the most
popular director of the silent era.

00:00:08.121 --> 00:00:11.299
During the year 1913,
he made dozens of films.

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:14.213
One of the films that is most important

00:00:14.213 --> 00:00:18.053
is "The Mothering Heart",
starring Lillian Gish.

00:00:18.633 --> 00:00:22.966
She is a young bride
and is rather victorian.

00:00:22.966 --> 00:00:26.717
She is trying to make her home comfortable

00:00:26.717 --> 00:00:29.100
and pleasing for her husband.

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.603
At one point, she takes an
interest in baby clothes.

00:00:31.603 --> 00:00:34.047
This is signaling to the
audience that she's pregnant.

00:00:34.047 --> 00:00:36.817
Her husband is much more
interested in the life in the city.

00:00:36.817 --> 00:00:38.339
(darker mood music)

00:00:38.339 --> 00:00:42.190
Along the way, he meets what
is called an "idol lady",

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:47.534
a very well-dressed young
woman and they begin an affair.

00:00:49.641 --> 00:00:52.246
He comes home and he is
obviously not satisfied

00:00:52.246 --> 00:00:56.553
with the lack of sophistication
that his wife shows him.

00:00:59.881 --> 00:01:02.296
What is really fascinating
about this film,

00:01:02.296 --> 00:01:05.048
is the way Lillian Gish's
character transforms

00:01:05.048 --> 00:01:06.932
into a modern woman.

00:01:07.762 --> 00:01:10.512
She decides to leave,
which is a very bold move

00:01:10.512 --> 00:01:12.983
for a young woman at that time.

00:01:14.133 --> 00:01:16.631
She goes back to live with her mother

00:01:16.631 --> 00:01:19.406
and has her baby.

00:01:20.107 --> 00:01:23.048
The husband comes running back to Lillian

00:01:23.048 --> 00:01:25.265
and she refuses to accept him.

00:01:28.012 --> 00:01:34.330
Unlike the idol woman,
who has no sense of self,

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.083
she is really a cipher
to these men she meets.

00:01:38.327 --> 00:01:41.200
Lillian Gish's character
finds this inner strength.

00:01:42.401 --> 00:01:45.708
She loses her husband, but
what she does gain in this

00:01:45.708 --> 00:01:48.091
is this personal integrity.

00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:52.085
The cinema is no longer
just entertainment.

00:01:52.085 --> 00:01:54.846
This is a way of learning.
