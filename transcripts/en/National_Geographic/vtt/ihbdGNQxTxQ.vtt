00:00:01.067 --> 00:00:03.803 align:start size:94% position:6%
- One day I was sitting
in Australia, in a desert.

00:00:03.803 --> 00:00:05.238
The land was red.

00:00:06.639 --> 00:00:08.742
I was next to an old man.

00:00:09.575 --> 00:00:11.411 line:0%
An old Aboriginal man.

00:00:12.578 --> 00:00:14.614 line:0%
And after we gaze
at the horizon,

00:00:14.614 --> 00:00:16.049 line:0%
after a few minutes,

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.585
he looks at me and he
said, "Hey little one.

00:00:19.585 --> 00:00:21.021
"You be careful."

00:00:23.055 --> 00:00:24.224
And I look at him a bit,

00:00:24.224 --> 00:00:26.359 align:start size:84% position:16%
wondering about
what's going on here.

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:29.929 align:start size:88% position:13%
"You be careful who
you tell your story to.

00:00:31.163 --> 00:00:33.666
"Because this is the
most precious thing

00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:35.334
"you will never own."

00:00:35.334 --> 00:00:38.471
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to my world,

00:00:38.471 --> 00:00:40.506 align:start size:88% position:13%
it's a really important
night tonight.

00:00:40.506 --> 00:00:44.044
We need to connect,
and feel connected.

00:00:44.044 --> 00:00:47.112
I invite you to come with
me in my life journey.

00:00:47.112 --> 00:00:48.548
Let's go walking.

00:00:50.883 --> 00:00:51.718
So,

00:00:51.884 --> 00:00:54.853
let's start actually
here in the States.

00:00:54.853 --> 00:00:57.489
I had this amazing idea, like,

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:01.327
I saw this little
trail called PCT.

00:01:01.327 --> 00:01:04.563
Had no idea what
was going on there.

00:01:04.563 --> 00:01:06.699
I read was amazing
journey going from

00:01:06.699 --> 00:01:10.236 align:start position:0%
the northern part of the States,
near the Canadian border,

00:01:10.236 --> 00:01:14.407
crossing all the west, and
reaching the Mexican border.

00:01:15.575 --> 00:01:18.311 align:start size:81% position:19%
I thought, this
was for me, right.

00:01:18.311 --> 00:01:20.112
Let's do this.

00:01:20.112 --> 00:01:24.083 align:start size:97% position:3%
Anyway, I start my journey,
in the Canadian border.

00:01:24.083 --> 00:01:28.721 align:start size:94% position:6%
In May, 2000, I come
from the mountain, right,

00:01:28.721 --> 00:01:32.324 align:start size:84% position:16%
so I know about
snow, a little bit.

00:01:32.324 --> 00:01:35.195
Anyway, I thought
makes a good time.

00:01:35.195 --> 00:01:38.798 align:start size:97% position:3%
I start walking, not knowing
much about the bear story

00:01:38.798 --> 00:01:41.401 align:start position:0%
because I thought there was
already a bear story out there

00:01:41.401 --> 00:01:43.436
about bears, grizzly bear.

00:01:43.436 --> 00:01:45.905
I thought, I'd better
do that on my own way,

00:01:45.905 --> 00:01:47.807
so I do not get scared.

00:01:49.042 --> 00:01:52.778
Right, I start walking
into this deep forest.

00:01:52.778 --> 00:01:54.413
And I had my plan B going on.

00:01:54.413 --> 00:01:57.950 align:start size:84% position:16%
I thought, if anything
goes really wrong,

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.053
I just jump on the tree.

00:02:00.053 --> 00:02:01.387
This is a good plan.

00:02:01.387 --> 00:02:03.956 align:start size:84% position:16%
Anyway, I keep
walking over the days,

00:02:03.956 --> 00:02:07.360
and I look at the tree,
it has this funny mark

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.829
on the side of the
tree, and I thought,

00:02:09.829 --> 00:02:12.564 align:start size:81% position:19%
what is this thing
going on there?

00:02:12.564 --> 00:02:15.067 align:start size:84% position:16%
I saw this huge claw
mark, I thought,

00:02:15.067 --> 00:02:17.603
oh, holy holy holy God,

00:02:17.603 --> 00:02:19.438
those things climbing.

00:02:19.438 --> 00:02:21.741 align:start size:81% position:19%
I can see these
marks on the tree,

00:02:21.741 --> 00:02:24.210 align:start size:84% position:16%
I thought, this is
going to be tough one.

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:28.414 align:start size:97% position:3%
Anyway, few days later I
climb a summit full of snow,

00:02:28.414 --> 00:02:32.251
and, unfortunately,
the weather changed.

00:02:32.251 --> 00:02:35.054 align:start size:84% position:16%
This cold front became
a really hot front,

00:02:35.054 --> 00:02:37.924
really warm front going on.

00:02:37.924 --> 00:02:41.094 align:start size:84% position:16%
And that was my first
time I nearly...

00:02:42.862 --> 00:02:44.464
Find death.

00:02:45.832 --> 00:02:50.803 align:start position:0%
I was on this slope, going
really really really like that,

00:02:50.803 --> 00:02:52.905
on the lateral way
of the mountain.

00:02:52.905 --> 00:02:56.142
Suddenly, I feel my
legs going like that.

00:02:56.142 --> 00:02:57.776
And the snow falling down.

00:02:57.776 --> 00:03:00.513
The avalanche was
nearly taking me.

00:03:00.513 --> 00:03:04.083 align:start size:94% position:6%
I had this surviving
skills of running uphill,

00:03:04.083 --> 00:03:07.487
find this big rock,
hiding behind a rock.

00:03:08.687 --> 00:03:12.658
And I've been staying
there for six days.

00:03:12.658 --> 00:03:14.626
Well, I survived right?

00:03:14.626 --> 00:03:16.295
That's all that matters, really.

00:03:16.295 --> 00:03:18.498 align:start size:84% position:16%
So, I did what
everybody would do.

00:03:18.498 --> 00:03:20.733 align:start size:94% position:6%
Wake up every day at three
o'clock in the morning

00:03:20.733 --> 00:03:22.935
and testing the snow.

00:03:22.935 --> 00:03:24.871 align:start size:84% position:16%
One day that snow
would be hard enough

00:03:24.871 --> 00:03:26.706
for me to go on.

00:03:26.706 --> 00:03:29.007
I did exactly that.

00:03:29.007 --> 00:03:32.778
But first mistake, I didn't
have all the topographic map.

00:03:32.778 --> 00:03:35.147 align:start size:97% position:3%
You know, you've got a
trail, you follow the trail,

00:03:35.147 --> 00:03:37.216
so you've got the trail map.

00:03:37.216 --> 00:03:39.418
But, this is wrong.

00:03:39.418 --> 00:03:42.588
You always have
to have a plan B.

00:03:42.588 --> 00:03:44.123 align:start size:84% position:16%
If anything go wrong,
you need to know

00:03:44.123 --> 00:03:46.325
what's going on around it,

00:03:46.325 --> 00:03:47.960
so I didn't have this map.

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:51.564
So I followed a green
valley down the hill.

00:03:51.564 --> 00:03:55.401 align:start size:94% position:6%
I arrived there, and
after a few days, finally,

00:03:55.968 --> 00:04:00.640
I reached a carpark, and
this old woman was there.

00:04:02.141 --> 00:04:05.711
She looked at me
and she, (screams).

00:04:05.711 --> 00:04:08.381 align:start size:97% position:3%
I was like, oh, what's
going on, a bear somewhere?!

00:04:08.381 --> 00:04:09.449
Or something.

00:04:11.517 --> 00:04:16.222
And, this woman, look at me
like she saw the Devil in me.

00:04:16.222 --> 00:04:18.891 align:start size:88% position:13%
Her husband ran, he
said, "What's going on?"

00:04:18.891 --> 00:04:21.560
I said, "I don't know."

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:24.630
And he look at me and
say, "Are you alright?"

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:26.232
I said, "I'm just fine."

00:04:26.232 --> 00:04:28.000
"Are you sure?"

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.170 align:start size:84% position:16%
I had second degrees
burn on my face,

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:33.505
and my whole face
was a big blister,

00:04:33.505 --> 00:04:37.310
actually, were falling
down, pieces of skin

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:39.344
was falling down my face.

00:04:39.344 --> 00:04:41.781
But I didn't care about that,
I was just about surviving.

00:04:41.781 --> 00:04:44.751
Anyway, the story goes on, so
I get to that little village,

00:04:44.751 --> 00:04:46.752
I was starving.

00:04:46.752 --> 00:04:50.355
I get into the first
pub, and I start to eat

00:04:50.355 --> 00:04:52.658
my fish and chips.

00:04:52.658 --> 00:04:54.993
First plate, second plate.

00:04:54.993 --> 00:04:57.263 align:start size:84% position:16%
On my second plate the
police come behind,

00:04:57.263 --> 00:04:59.064
and say, "Miss Marquis?"

00:04:59.064 --> 00:05:00.900
I say, "Uh, mm, yeah?"

00:05:02.101 --> 00:05:04.336
"Come with us please.

00:05:04.336 --> 00:05:07.606
"Did you walk through
those lands there?"

00:05:07.606 --> 00:05:10.143
I say, "Well, I just
got off the mountain,

00:05:10.143 --> 00:05:11.243
"was dangerous."

00:05:11.243 --> 00:05:14.413
"Yeah, you walk on FBI land."

00:05:14.413 --> 00:05:16.482
"Well, there is, I
didn't know that,

00:05:16.482 --> 00:05:18.651
"there was some
snow everywhere."

00:05:18.651 --> 00:05:20.119
"Well, okay."

00:05:20.119 --> 00:05:24.290 align:start size:97% position:3%
So they give me a ticket,
and was like a $5000 warning,

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:26.793
like if I don't get out
of that Washington state

00:05:26.793 --> 00:05:29.529 align:start size:81% position:19%
in 48 hours, I
will get arrested.

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:34.700 align:start size:88% position:13%
So I was like, "Alright,
Plan B, anywhere."

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:37.637
I make connection, I flew all
the way down to San Diego,

00:05:37.637 --> 00:05:41.807
and start again, walking from
the Mexican border this time.

00:05:41.807 --> 00:05:44.677
I thought, that's going to be s.

00:05:44.677 --> 00:05:47.046
Well, safe kind of, because,

00:05:47.046 --> 00:05:51.617 align:start size:97% position:3%
I had, at that time, the
Mojave Desert, in front of me,

00:05:51.617 --> 00:05:53.719
in full July.

00:05:53.719 --> 00:05:54.953
It's a bit more complicated.

00:05:54.953 --> 00:05:57.723
Anyway, I finish this
incredible journey,

00:05:57.723 --> 00:06:01.493 align:start size:97% position:3%
I can go on all night about
this journey, because,

00:06:01.493 --> 00:06:03.096
it's been really incredible.

00:06:04.697 --> 00:06:09.001 align:start size:94% position:6%
We save a guy in the
river, nearly dead, John,

00:06:09.001 --> 00:06:14.840 align:start size:97% position:3%
and he survive after a long
journey of running away

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:19.044 align:start size:84% position:16%
from the guy, for
two days to get help

00:06:19.044 --> 00:06:21.748
in this really remote area.

00:06:22.948 --> 00:06:24.884
But all went well, I finished.

00:06:24.884 --> 00:06:28.221 align:start size:84% position:16%
And then, back
home, I had my mind,

00:06:28.221 --> 00:06:31.390
it was like if I opened a
little door inside my mind.

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:35.895
I'd win, I had dreams,
big dreams.

00:06:37.062 --> 00:06:39.565
I had this dream of Australia.

00:06:41.234 --> 00:06:44.937 align:start size:84% position:16%
What's about if I
start in the middle,

00:06:44.937 --> 00:06:49.574
and I go all around it
and finish in the middle?

00:06:49.574 --> 00:06:52.011
It's like a 14 month journey.

00:06:53.179 --> 00:06:56.249
30 kilometers a day,
14,000 kilometers.

00:06:58.284 --> 00:07:00.819
And, I just did that.

00:07:00.819 --> 00:07:03.322
I start, after one
year preparation.

00:07:03.322 --> 00:07:06.992
After three months,
I met my dog, Joe.

00:07:06.992 --> 00:07:08.961
He was in a farm,
not really happy.

00:07:08.961 --> 00:07:12.298
I stole the dog, run
away with the dog.

00:07:12.298 --> 00:07:16.669 align:start size:97% position:3%
Arrive in a forest, completely
exhausted, out of breath.

00:07:16.669 --> 00:07:18.771
I was like, okay,
I've got a dog.

00:07:18.771 --> 00:07:19.972
Let's do this.

00:07:19.972 --> 00:07:21.173
Talk to the dog, I say,

00:07:21.173 --> 00:07:23.142
"Well, we're going to
walk together, right.

00:07:23.142 --> 00:07:25.544 align:start size:84% position:16%
"We're going to do 10,000
kilometers together."

00:07:25.544 --> 00:07:27.079
It looked at me and said, "yes,"

00:07:27.079 --> 00:07:31.283
"I'm in," and we took off and
we had this amazing journey.

00:07:31.283 --> 00:07:32.985 align:start size:84% position:16%
I finished my
expedition with him,

00:07:32.985 --> 00:07:35.120 align:start size:84% position:16%
and I bring him
back to Switzerland.

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:39.925 align:start size:97% position:3%
He is a wild dog, it's
half dingo, half Red Heeler,

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:44.329
and he survived and lived
until he was 17 years old,

00:07:44.329 --> 00:07:45.331
in the snow.

00:07:46.799 --> 00:07:50.970
So, just two weeks before
the end of this expedition,

00:07:51.737 --> 00:07:55.074
I walk in a place,
a special place.

00:07:56.508 --> 00:07:58.511
An Aboriginal community.

00:07:59.678 --> 00:08:01.781
Anyway, I had a bit of
a health problem, there.

00:08:01.781 --> 00:08:05.751 align:start size:94% position:6%
I wake up near a fire pit,
and all I can hear was

00:08:05.751 --> 00:08:09.155
(high pitched warbling).

00:08:11.056 --> 00:08:13.225
I was like, right.

00:08:13.225 --> 00:08:15.694
This looks interesting to me.

00:08:15.694 --> 00:08:17.163
And I was like, what's going on?

00:08:17.163 --> 00:08:18.331
They saved me.

00:08:19.498 --> 00:08:22.100
I just collapsed in a
dune and they saved me.

00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:24.536 align:start size:94% position:6%
And accept me in the
community like their own.

00:08:24.536 --> 00:08:26.973
I had a mom, this was my mom.

00:08:28.607 --> 00:08:30.209
I've got sisters...

00:08:32.278 --> 00:08:34.913 align:start size:84% position:16%
What happened, we
go hunting together.

00:08:34.913 --> 00:08:37.883
And I was like, oh yes, I
can go hunting with them.

00:08:37.883 --> 00:08:40.118
Imagine what I'm going to learn,

00:08:40.118 --> 00:08:42.187
because I was hunting myself,

00:08:42.187 --> 00:08:44.890 align:start size:84% position:16%
so when I was hunting,
I was hunting like,

00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:48.560
just trying to make
no noise at all.

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:51.263
Just try to be one with nature.

00:08:51.263 --> 00:08:52.564
Well, didn't work really well.

00:08:52.564 --> 00:08:55.401 align:start size:88% position:13%
I was hunting with those
women and they've got

00:08:55.401 --> 00:08:57.202 align:start size:84% position:16%
this big butt
going on, you know.

00:08:57.202 --> 00:08:59.971 align:start size:97% position:3%
And you can see them moving
through the landscape,

00:08:59.971 --> 00:09:01.473 align:start size:84% position:16%
and they were talking
to each other,

00:09:01.473 --> 00:09:05.477
their long line, and they're
like (high pitched warbling).

00:09:05.477 --> 00:09:08.080
And moving their butt,
but suddenly,

00:09:08.347 --> 00:09:11.017
one lizard, one goanna.

00:09:11.583 --> 00:09:13.085
I was like, what?!

00:09:14.386 --> 00:09:15.921
I didn't see anything.

00:09:15.921 --> 00:09:17.423
They were yelling at each other.

00:09:17.423 --> 00:09:20.959 align:start size:88% position:13%
Well, I make the point,
and I'm going to follow her

00:09:20.959 --> 00:09:23.028
from behind all the way.

00:09:23.028 --> 00:09:24.196
I did that for a long time,

00:09:24.196 --> 00:09:25.664
I never find her trick.

00:09:25.664 --> 00:09:29.134 align:start size:88% position:13%
She knew where the
lizard, the goanna was,

00:09:29.134 --> 00:09:31.437
and where to find food.

00:09:31.437 --> 00:09:34.206 align:start size:97% position:3%
Those people got this amazing
connection with nature,

00:09:34.206 --> 00:09:38.377
you will never believe
how connected they are.

00:09:38.377 --> 00:09:40.780
And, from the day one, it
was a bit of a problem,

00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:41.847
me, be there.

00:09:44.083 --> 00:09:48.887
So what happened, it's,
they decide to marry me.

00:09:48.887 --> 00:09:49.722
Yeah.

00:09:50.689 --> 00:09:52.824
They marry me to George.

00:09:52.824 --> 00:09:55.928 align:start size:84% position:16%
One morning I realized
I was married.

00:09:55.928 --> 00:09:58.463
How cool is that, right?

00:09:58.463 --> 00:10:01.500
No wedding, preparation
for months and months,

00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:04.203
you just married like that.

00:10:04.203 --> 00:10:07.039
And, I say, can
I see my husband?

00:10:07.039 --> 00:10:08.908
You know, innocently?

00:10:08.908 --> 00:10:10.242
Which one is it?

00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:15.581
And, she pointed this guy
behind the tree out there,

00:10:15.581 --> 00:10:17.349
he was cross-legged.

00:10:17.349 --> 00:10:22.922
He was painting, his name is
George, he was 80 years old.

00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:27.693 align:start size:88% position:13%
So the young women,
they used to marry them

00:10:27.693 --> 00:10:31.864
with the old one to make
the community quite stable.

00:10:32.998 --> 00:10:35.901 align:start size:88% position:13%
But, those people,
those Aboriginal people,

00:10:35.901 --> 00:10:38.403
for me was it, that was
it, that was my family,

00:10:38.403 --> 00:10:39.704
that was my place.

00:10:39.704 --> 00:10:42.741
That was the way I belonged to.

00:10:42.741 --> 00:10:46.244
Everything was so
natural, so pure.

00:10:46.244 --> 00:10:50.783 align:start size:88% position:13%
In a lot of ways, for
me, that was the answer.

00:10:50.783 --> 00:10:51.617
And,

00:10:51.784 --> 00:10:56.789
one day they say, well,
everybody's got a totem,

00:10:56.789 --> 00:11:00.960 align:start size:97% position:3%
some, the kangaroo, some,
the emu, some are the snakes,

00:11:02.327 --> 00:11:06.031 align:start size:94% position:6%
and they give me a totem,
and they said to me,

00:11:06.031 --> 00:11:07.533
"You are jabiru."

00:11:09.034 --> 00:11:12.705 align:start size:84% position:16%
I say, "Jabiru?
What is a jabiru?"

00:11:12.705 --> 00:11:14.774
Oh, it's a bird.

00:11:14.774 --> 00:11:16.575
I thought, wow!

00:11:16.575 --> 00:11:17.510
I'm a bird.

00:11:19.044 --> 00:11:21.613
I'm a beautiful bird.

00:11:21.613 --> 00:11:23.448
I'm so happy, I was so proud.

00:11:23.448 --> 00:11:27.653 align:start size:88% position:13%
Like, what can be better
than a bird, really.

00:11:27.653 --> 00:11:29.321
So this is the bird.

00:11:30.455 --> 00:11:33.325 align:start size:84% position:16%
The most ugliest
bird I've ever seen.

00:11:33.325 --> 00:11:36.162
So, but they were
not that, wrong.

00:11:37.396 --> 00:11:41.067
Look at the legs, long
legs, big nose, right?

00:11:42.768 --> 00:11:44.470 align:start size:81% position:19%
Anyway, I finished
my expedition,

00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:48.474
I finally walk away from
my family, this family,

00:11:49.909 --> 00:11:53.379
and I promised myself,
if I walk away from here,

00:11:54.814 --> 00:11:58.617
I have to talk, I have to
communicate with the world,

00:11:58.617 --> 00:12:02.254 align:start size:88% position:13%
about this possible
connection with nature.

00:12:02.254 --> 00:12:05.324 align:start size:97% position:3%
And that's what I start
doing as soon as I get home,

00:12:05.324 --> 00:12:08.794
I start writing, and
giving conferences.

00:12:08.794 --> 00:12:11.263
Then, meanwhile
I was doing this,

00:12:11.263 --> 00:12:13.832
I had this wild dream.

00:12:13.832 --> 00:12:17.670 align:start size:88% position:13%
I saw, a little story
about those Inca people,

00:12:19.605 --> 00:12:23.475
during the Inca Empire,
where they were running

00:12:23.475 --> 00:12:25.877
on top of the Andes.

00:12:25.877 --> 00:12:28.380
And I thought, what?!

00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:29.681
What's going on there?!

00:12:29.681 --> 00:12:31.816
And I been doing some research,

00:12:31.816 --> 00:12:34.987
and that this wild
expedition starts.

00:12:34.987 --> 00:12:39.224 align:start size:97% position:3%
I plan to walk from Santiago
de Chile, the capital,

00:12:39.224 --> 00:12:41.961
all the way following the Andes.

00:12:41.961 --> 00:12:45.064
Go through Bolivia,
arriving to Peru,

00:12:46.431 --> 00:12:49.034
and then, go up
the Machu Picchu.

00:12:49.034 --> 00:12:50.301
Well I did just that,

00:12:50.301 --> 00:12:53.706 align:start size:84% position:16%
eight months of really
surprising journey,

00:12:56.241 --> 00:12:59.945
to arrive in Machu
Picchu in one piece.

00:12:59.945 --> 00:13:02.948
Really skinny, well, I
lose a lot of weight,

00:13:02.948 --> 00:13:07.218
and I get arrested by the
Special Forces there too,

00:13:07.218 --> 00:13:10.389
after three minutes
on Machu Picchu.

00:13:10.389 --> 00:13:13.559
But, I made it, so, with
the help of my brother,

00:13:13.559 --> 00:13:16.528 align:start position:0%
my little brother, we were
really a big help at that time,

00:13:16.528 --> 00:13:19.465 align:start size:97% position:3%
because he did resupply
points all the way through,

00:13:19.465 --> 00:13:22.868
because there is not much food
and water on that expedition.

00:13:22.868 --> 00:13:26.939 align:start size:97% position:3%
And then, I had this
relaxed time in Switzerland.

00:13:28.506 --> 00:13:31.977 align:start size:84% position:16%
I've got time between
two expeditions
where I just breathe,

00:13:33.445 --> 00:13:36.982
and live, and so I was going
to my little grocery store.

00:13:38.684 --> 00:13:40.552 align:start size:88% position:13%
And, it's a little
organic store where I go

00:13:40.552 --> 00:13:42.221
to buy all my stuff.

00:13:43.422 --> 00:13:46.225
And, I had all my bags,
and get out of the shop,

00:13:46.225 --> 00:13:50.062 align:start size:94% position:6%
try to cross the road, was
too many cars going on,

00:13:50.062 --> 00:13:52.431
and I thought, okay,
I put my bags down,

00:13:52.431 --> 00:13:54.266 align:start size:84% position:16%
and just look
around a little bit.

00:13:54.266 --> 00:13:58.704 align:start position:0%
Turn around, and I see this
little travel agency behind me.

00:13:58.704 --> 00:14:02.875 align:start position:0%
And this big picture there,
massive picture, green picture.

00:14:04.409 --> 00:14:08.279 align:start size:97% position:3%
Was like a Mongolian steppe,
you can actually feel

00:14:08.279 --> 00:14:11.784 align:start size:84% position:16%
drawn into the
picture, was so green!

00:14:11.784 --> 00:14:13.118
I was like, wow.

00:14:13.118 --> 00:14:16.454 align:start size:84% position:16%
Anyway, went home,
didn't think about it.

00:14:16.454 --> 00:14:18.524
Then, this picture grow on me,

00:14:18.524 --> 00:14:21.660 align:start size:84% position:16%
and I start to search
about Mongolia.

00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:25.731 align:start size:97% position:3%
Then, wow, the Baikal lakes,
not far from Siberia.

00:14:27.632 --> 00:14:31.369
And then south of it, you've
got the Gobi desert, right.

00:14:31.369 --> 00:14:34.640
And then if you go
south, into China,

00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:36.508
amazing China.

00:14:36.508 --> 00:14:39.177
And then Laos, and
Thailand, and then if

00:14:39.177 --> 00:14:42.948 align:start size:97% position:3%
you've got a bit of water,
but then you've got Australia.

00:14:42.948 --> 00:14:44.783
Well, I just did that.

00:14:46.151 --> 00:14:47.986 align:start size:84% position:16%
I build this
incredible expedition.

00:14:47.986 --> 00:14:52.357
Two years preparation,
to walk from Siberia,

00:14:52.357 --> 00:14:54.793
all the way down to Australia.

00:14:55.794 --> 00:14:57.463
Took me three years.

00:14:59.431 --> 00:15:02.701
Well, didn't, things
happen on the way.

00:15:04.636 --> 00:15:05.971
We're going to see what happene,

00:15:05.971 --> 00:15:08.139 align:start size:84% position:16%
when an expedition
really starts,

00:15:08.139 --> 00:15:11.043 align:start size:84% position:16%
it's not everything
as you planned.

00:15:13.478 --> 00:15:17.149
Mongolia's been surprising,
I needed to start three times

00:15:17.149 --> 00:15:19.151
to go through Mongolia.

00:15:19.151 --> 00:15:20.385
Two, it's not enough.

00:15:20.385 --> 00:15:23.388
Don't take no for an
answer, never do that.

00:15:23.388 --> 00:15:26.591 align:start size:81% position:19%
The first no, it's
a good safe no.

00:15:26.591 --> 00:15:31.096
Then, a first no, it means
you're not in the right door.

00:15:31.096 --> 00:15:34.032 align:start size:84% position:16%
You got a few other
door to get in.

00:15:34.032 --> 00:15:38.603
And really, the Gobi desert
and Mongolia was about that.

00:15:38.603 --> 00:15:40.372
How determined I was.

00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:46.611
This land, not going to let me
go through it the first time.

00:15:46.611 --> 00:15:49.782 size:88% position:44%
And I hope, I hone
my passage there.

00:15:51.215 --> 00:15:53.618
Because every step I was doing,

00:15:53.618 --> 00:15:55.787
I was not following a trail.

00:15:55.787 --> 00:15:59.358
I make my own trail,
I make my own reality.

00:16:00.259 --> 00:16:01.860
One step at a time.

00:16:02.994 --> 00:16:05.230
Took me three years though.

00:16:06.231 --> 00:16:08.233
Take a bit of time, but,

00:16:09.601 --> 00:16:12.470 align:start size:94% position:6%
imagine, you can go
around the world on foot.

00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:13.638
Imagine.

00:16:13.638 --> 00:16:16.675
The thing is, you can do this,

00:16:16.675 --> 00:16:20.979
but you have to know how your
brain works, a little bit.

00:16:20.979 --> 00:16:24.483
If you tell your brain, I'm
going to go around the world

00:16:24.483 --> 00:16:27.952 align:start size:84% position:16%
on foot, it's going to
say, yeah right.

00:16:27.952 --> 00:16:31.656 align:start size:97% position:3%
You know, sit on the couch,
watch TV, relax, have a drink.

00:16:31.656 --> 00:16:35.260
You will see, you forget
about this idea later on.

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:39.030 align:start size:88% position:13%
So don't let your brain,
your little computer

00:16:39.030 --> 00:16:41.500
make funny decisions for you.

00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:44.570
You need to be in
charge on this one.

00:16:46.238 --> 00:16:48.840
Your dream, it's the
most important thing

00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:50.342
that you can have.

00:16:52.343 --> 00:16:54.947
How big is the dream, go for it.

00:16:56.548 --> 00:16:58.884
But it's one step at a time.

00:17:00.918 --> 00:17:02.687
So I reached three years later,

00:17:02.687 --> 00:17:05.891
this little tiny amazing tree.

00:17:05.891 --> 00:17:08.360
Look at this picture.

00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:12.231 align:start size:97% position:3%
So that was a tree that I
met on my Australian journey

00:17:12.231 --> 00:17:16.300 align:start size:84% position:16%
between 2002 and
2003, I met that tree,

00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:17.769
I make a promise to that tree.

00:17:17.769 --> 00:17:21.540
I said, darling, don't
worry, I will be back.

00:17:22.674 --> 00:17:26.745 align:start size:88% position:13%
And when the idea of
finishing my expedition,

00:17:26.745 --> 00:17:29.847 align:start size:84% position:16%
where I could finish
my expedition and
my team was saying,

00:17:29.847 --> 00:17:32.150 align:start size:84% position:16%
well Sarah, you're
going to finish in town,

00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:36.855
so we've got the media, we've
got the TV station coming in.

00:17:36.855 --> 00:17:38.123
I said, "no way."

00:17:39.525 --> 00:17:43.127
We going to finish there,
it's the middle of nowhere.

00:17:43.127 --> 00:17:46.131 align:start size:84% position:16%
And I finished
exactly near my tree.
