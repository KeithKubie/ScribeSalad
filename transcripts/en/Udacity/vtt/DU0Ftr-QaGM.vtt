00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:02.560
&gt;&gt; Okay Michael, I've drawn a little teensy

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:04.320
tiny graph on the screen. Can you see it?

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:05.390
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:07.340
&gt;&gt; Okay, and some points are positive, some

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.468
points are negative. And let's just imagine, for the

00:00:10.468 --> 00:00:13.060
sake of argument, that the green line that I've

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:16.040
drawn in between them is in fact the optimal

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:18.510
separator. It probably isn't, but let's just pretend that

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.780
I drew the right one. Now, I've just told

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:25.720
you that a lot of the alphas are going to be zero, and some of them are not.

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.420
So, thinking about everything that we've said, and

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:31.880
thinking about what it means to build, this, what

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.121
it means to build, an, an optimal decision

00:00:35.121 --> 00:00:38.340
boundary, maximizing a margin. I want you to, t,

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.810
point to one of the posit examples that

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:45.100
almost certainly is not going to have a non-zero

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.510
alpha, and one of the minus examples that almost

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.800
certainly is not going to have a non-zero alpha.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.930
That is, are not a part of the support vectors.

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.110
&gt;&gt; You want something that does not not have a zero?

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:58.606
&gt;&gt; Don't confuse me.

00:00:58.606 --> 00:01:01.000
&gt;&gt; Do you want [LAUGH] something that's, that,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.300
that has a zero alpha or a non-zero alpha?

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.630
&gt;&gt; I want something that has a zero alpha.

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:07.320
&gt;&gt; Got it.

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.130
&gt;&gt; That is, in some sense, doesn't matter. Okay, go.
