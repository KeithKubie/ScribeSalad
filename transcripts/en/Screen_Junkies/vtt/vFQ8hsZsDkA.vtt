00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:11.640
Before Solo milks your nostalgia for the Original Trilogy dry,

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.860
discover 3 spinoffs that took everything you loved about the old Star Wars movies

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:16.960
"YAHOO!"

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.840
"I love you."

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:18.560
"I know."

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:19.900
and gave you something...

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:20.600
uh...

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:22.560
let's just say different.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.480
"Stir, whip, stir, whip, beat, beat, stir.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:27.880
That's not right. I'm sorry."

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.120
Kick off an evening of crap with Caravan of Courage,

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.760
the Ewok movie set before the other Ewok movie

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.020
but after the movie that was 30% Ewok.

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.640
Embark on an adventure with no one's favorite unblinking murder bears

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.620
as they team up with another creature that's better in small doses:

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:49.540
a kid.

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.160
"I think they wanna be our friends."

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.480
Together, they'll search for her missing parents with her brother Mace,

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.020
a Skywalker knockoff with the hair of Luke

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.500
and the acting of Anakin.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.220
"It looks like the monster is something real big! Where is it?"

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:04.960
And of course, Tinker Bell?

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.420
"I think she eats giggles."

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:11.760
Wow, they were planting the seeds of that Disney buyout really early, huh?

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:14.520
If Caravan of Courage is The Hobbit,

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:15.600
then get ready

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.260
'cause Battle of Endor is Game of Thrones.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.620
Without question, the darkest Star Wars movie ever made,

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.780
where most of the Ewoks are slaughtered in the opening scene,

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.020
the 4-year-old's whole family is massacred.

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.520
"My family are all dead.

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.100
I'm all alone."

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:32.820
She's kidnapped by a dragon,

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.900
and has to spend the rest of her life getting yelled at by Wilford Brimley.

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:37.320
"I don't want you here! Get out!

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.460
GO ON! GET OUT!"

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:40.860
That'll screw up someone for life.

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.520
Holy crap, this is a Captain Phasma prequel, isn't it?!

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.840
"I'll have to learn grownup things."

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.060
"Execute."

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.900
But those are just warmups for the main event.

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:54.800
Watch the original Star Wars trilogy lose its final shred of dignity

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.840
in The Star Wars Holiday Special,

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.120
a project so bad,

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.360
George Lucas wanted it destroyed forever.

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.340
And that guy made Attack of the Clones.

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:03.720
"Wow!

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:05.500
Whaddaya know?"

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:08.580
Sit through this vaguely Star Wars themed variety show,

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.640
where the only variety is the level of drugs they were on when they wrote it,

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.160
whether it's a song from Mos Eisley Cantina owner

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.860
Bea Arthur???

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.720
♫ Just one more round, friend ♫

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.580
♫ Then homeward bound, friend! ♫

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:24.100
A song from 70's soft rock titans Jefferson Starship,

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.680
♫ Will you light the sky on fire? ♫

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.340
or a song from Princess Leia

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.920
while Harrison Ford regrets all of his life choices.

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:37.480
♫ A day of joy we all can share ♫

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.520
Now that's the face of a man who has a really bad feeling about this.

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.980
In between the

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:42.480
(Ahem)

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:43.540
talent sections,

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.540
enjoy a tiny scrap of story tying it all together.

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:51.040
Where Chewie has to get home to his Itchy, Mala, and Lumpy for Life Day,

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.700
which is like Christmas, but hairy and vaguely Wiccan.

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.780
The Empire is on high alert thanks to an overdubbed scene from A New Hope.

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.240
"I want the Rebels located and identified."

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:03.500
But with no help from Luke,

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:04.560
"Where's Chewbacca?"

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:05.680
no help from Leia,

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.760
"Send either Chewbacca or Han Solo to the screen, please."

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.640
and actual help from one half of The Honeymooners' Art Carney,

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.080
"I brought you that proton pack.

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.360
You know, for the whatsit...

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.060
the whatchamacallit, the thingamabob."

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.540
Chewie's family will spend over an hour horrifically groaning at each other

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.360
while you try to maintain your last shred of sanity.

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:31.400
[Wookie roaring]

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:37.140
[More Wookie roaring]

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:38.920
Kill me!

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.460
So melt your brain with 3 Star Wars films so awful,

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:46.780
you'll never complain about the prequels, The Last Jedi, or Solo again

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.280
because no matter what Disney decides to throw at us next,

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.880
there's no way it will be as bad as Chewie's dad watching VR porn in the middle of the living room.

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:55.700
Did I...

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:56.960
Did I just dream that?

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.900
Oh, nope, nope, there it is. That was real.

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.520
"Oh, we are excited, aren't we?"

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.560
Aw, geez, turn it off, turn it off!

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:20.240
"Those were awful good pies. Best I ever had."

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:26.940
"Fuck."

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:45.260
You know the weirdest thing about these movies?

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.900
It's the first appearance of Boba Fett and it's awesome!

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.460
"I take it you have no love of the Empire."

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:51.400
"I don't."

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:52.800
"Follow me, friend.

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:54.740
Settle down!

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:57.940
All they do is eat."

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:12.260
