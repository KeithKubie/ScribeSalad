00:00:05.538 --> 00:00:07.955
(music)

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.670
- My name's Dylan Penningroth,

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:34.480
I'm a Professor of Law and
History here at Berkeley,

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.420
and I'm chair of the Jefferson
Memorial Lectures Committee.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.590
Just a little bit of background
about these lectures,

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.570
they were established way
back in 1980, excuse me,

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.670
1944, through a bequest
from Elizabeth Bonestell

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.683
and her husband Cutler L.
Bonestell of San Francisco,

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:55.270
and the Bonestells cared
deeply about history,

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:58.600
and they hoped that these
lectures would encourage students,

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.090
faculty, scholars, and area residents

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:03.850
to study the legacy of Thomas Jefferson,

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.030
and to explore values inherent
to American democracy.

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.710
And past lecturers, who have
included Annette Gordon-Reed,

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:15.630
Senator Alan Simpson,
Senator Elizabeth Warren,

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.250
Archibald Cox, and most
recently, George Packer,

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:20.890
have delivered Jefferson Lectures

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.500
on early American history,
about Jefferson himself,

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.470
and on American institutions and policies

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.620
in politics, economics,
education, and law.

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:31.810
Now, before I go any further,

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:36.810
I have to say that any event
like this is a group effort,

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.420
as any of you who have
organized one will know,

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.400
and the committee, which
includes Mark Brilliant,

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.530
Paul Pearson, Wendy Silver, Karen Tawny,

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.650
Christopher Tomlins, and I join me

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:53.980
in thanking Whitney
Mellow, Sevala Travinsky,

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:57.480
and especially Ellen Gobler,
who you just saw up here,

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:01.293
for their deft and tactful
handling of all the logistics.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.630
So we're pleased on behalf
of the Graduate Division

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:06.980
to present this year's speaker

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:10.763
in the Jefferson Memorial
Lecture Series, David Cole.

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:13.960
So in July, 2016,

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.980
David Cole was named
National Legal Director

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.660
of the American Civil Liberties
Union, our country's largest

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.853
and oldest civil liberties organization.

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.880
So in July, 2016, you may remember,

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.880
The New York Times gave
Hillary Clinton a 74% chance

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.940
of becoming president, it
looked like things were going

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.940
to be, well, maybe not all
right, but at least aight.

00:02:42.277 --> 00:02:43.510
(audience laughs)

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:44.882
Right?

00:02:44.882 --> 00:02:46.560
(audience murmurs)

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.420
We all know what happened next, and thanks

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:54.420
to Robert Mueller, we're slowly
finding out how it happened,

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.700
now, David Cole has been at the forefront

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.620
of those who are fighting the
consequences of what happened.

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.150
Since that fateful November,

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.980
this already busy man
has become even busier,

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.240
as National Legal Director, he oversees

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:14.240
about 1,400 civil liberties
lawsuits, and manages over,

00:03:15.204 --> 00:03:19.010
excuse me, 300 staff
attorneys at ACLU headquarters

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.670
in New York, and affiliate
offices in all 50 states,

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:25.670
Puerto Rico, and Washington, DC.

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:27.430
There has never been a better time

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.747
to become what the first
George Bush once scorned,

00:03:31.747 --> 00:03:35.357
"a card carrying member of the ACLU."

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.580
Now, Cole was law clerk
to Judge Arlin Adams

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:42.270
of the Third Circuit Court of Appeals,

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:43.310
he was a staff attorney

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:44.780
at the Center for Constitutional Rights,

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.630
and he taught constitutional law

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:48.710
and criminal justice at Georgetown,

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:51.190
as the Honorable George
J. Mitchell Professor

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:52.940
in Law and Public Policy.

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:56.300
He's argued a number of
major civil liberties cases,

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:59.170
including Texas versus Johnson,

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:02.950
which struck down state laws
banning flag desecration,

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:05.230
National Endowment for
the Arts versus Finley,

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:09.003
which contested content
restrictions on NEA funding,

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.570
and Holder versus
Humanitarian Law Project,

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:15.300
which challenged the
legality of a provision

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:19.130
in the USA Patriot Act barring,
quote, "material support,"

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:22.740
end quote, to foreign
terrorist organizations.

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:26.410
In December, 2017, he
argued Masterpiece Cake Shop

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:29.590
versus Colorado Civil Rights Commission,

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:33.450
in which the rights of free
exercise, or free expression,

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:36.210
and the right in public accommodations

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:38.410
to protection against bias based

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:42.200
on sexual orientation
come together in conflict,

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:45.980
or what the legal historian
Rebecca J. Scott has called,

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:50.907
in another context, "public
rights, or the equal dignity

00:04:50.907 --> 00:04:54.797
"of citizens in the public
sphere, these are the stakes."

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.100
Cole has written or edited 10 books,

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:01.400
he's Legal Affairs
Correspondent for The Nation,

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:04.290
and a regular commentator
on National Public Radio.

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:06.410
He's received two honorary degrees,

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:08.730
and many awards for his civil liberties

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:12.450
and human rights work, including, in 2013,

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:16.930
the first Norman Dorsen
Presidential Prize from the ACLU,

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:19.870
awarded to an academic
for lifetime commitment

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:21.143
to civil liberties.

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:25.697
For his Jefferson
Lecture, Cole asks, quote,

00:05:25.697 --> 00:05:27.657
"What does the first year of fighting

00:05:27.657 --> 00:05:31.343
"for liberty tell us
about constitutional law,

00:05:31.343 --> 00:05:33.027
"and the future of civil liberties

00:05:33.027 --> 00:05:35.920
"and civil rights in the United States?"

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:39.716
Please join me in welcoming
David Cole to Berkeley.

00:05:39.716 --> 00:05:42.716
(audience applauds)

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:58.810
- Thank you so much for that
very lovely introduction,

00:06:01.437 --> 00:06:03.820
I, when I get an introduction like that,

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:07.410
I'm often, it often calls to
mind what Justice Brennan used

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:12.410
to say, when he got similar
over-the-top introductions,

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:16.287
he would say, you know, "I
wish my parents had been here

00:06:16.287 --> 00:06:20.577
"to hear it, my father
would have been proud,

00:06:20.577 --> 00:06:22.615
"and my mother would have believed it."

00:06:22.615 --> 00:06:24.330
(audience laughs)

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:26.960
So, and I am delighted

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:30.560
to be giving the Thomas
Jefferson lecture, I was,

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:35.560
earlier today, interviewed
for a video presentation,

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:38.190
and the, here at Berkeley,

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:41.740
and the person who was
doing the taping referred

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:46.047
to me as Mr. Jefferson, so I
thought that was interesting.

00:06:46.047 --> 00:06:48.340
(audience laughs)

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:52.840
But I will, I'll talk mostly
about the last year, and more

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:56.700
about what Donald Trump can
teach us about civil liberties

00:06:56.700 --> 00:07:00.823
than what Thomas Jefferson can teach us.

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:03.760
My principal

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:09.210
message here is that
while this is a dark time,

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:12.050
and there's no question
that it is a dark time

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:15.640
in our, in our country,
for a variety of reasons,

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:20.640
and for a variety of
segments of our population,

00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:24.603
it is also a time of opportunity.

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:28.720
And I think a time of,

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:30.310
of hope,

00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:32.820
and secondly,

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:35.780
that we will determine

00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:40.340
how this time is ultimately viewed

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:41.910
in history,

00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:44.650
and if we respond

00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:48.290
by exercising our civil liberties,

00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:53.290
we can, I think, transform
what is a very dark time

00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:56.400
into essentially a catalyst

00:07:56.400 --> 00:08:00.233
for a renewed progressive movement.

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:04.820
So it's easy, I think, to convince people

00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:06.060
that these are dark times,

00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:11.060
and I'm sure you've heard many
talks, and many, you know,

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:13.960
guests on talk shows talk
about how dark it is,

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:18.870
but I really want to look at
the other side of the coin,

00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:22.940
and that is where opportunity lies.

00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:24.700
But first, in terms of, you know,

00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:27.810
how things have changed, Dylan mentioned

00:08:27.810 --> 00:08:31.647
that I was hired in July, 2016,

00:08:31.647 --> 00:08:35.990
and I was hired, I was
recruited for the job

00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:38.910
by the Executive Director of the ACLU,

00:08:38.910 --> 00:08:41.250
Anthony Romero, who came
down to Washington, DC,

00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:44.967
where I was teaching at
Georgetown, and he said,

00:08:44.967 --> 00:08:48.107
"David, you know, I've got
an offer you can't refuse.

00:08:48.107 --> 00:08:52.117
"You have been teaching
constitutional law,

00:08:52.117 --> 00:08:55.647
"practicing constitutional
law for 30 something years

00:08:55.647 --> 00:08:59.737
"under a conservative
majority Supreme Court.

00:08:59.737 --> 00:09:02.317
"Just think what it would be like

00:09:02.317 --> 00:09:05.027
"to run the ACLU's legal docket,

00:09:05.027 --> 00:09:07.667
"and especially it's Supreme Court work

00:09:07.667 --> 00:09:11.380
"under a liberal majority Supreme Court."

00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:13.680
And, of course, The New
York Times may have had it

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:16.050
at 74%, that Hillary Clinton would win,

00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:18.530
I had it at 100%, that
Hillary Clinton would win,

00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:22.607
and I think most of the
people I knew had it at 100%,

00:09:22.607 --> 00:09:27.240
and so she would, of
course, name the successor

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:30.640
to Justice Scalia, and we would have,

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:32.690
for the first time in four decades,

00:09:32.690 --> 00:09:35.440
a liberal majority Supreme Court.

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:38.770
So I, of course, I signed
on the bottom line,

00:09:38.770 --> 00:09:43.770
I went to law school back in the 1980s,

00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:48.780
and my professors were
all people who had come up

00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:53.090
and become lawyers and law professors

00:09:53.090 --> 00:09:58.090
in the civil rights movement
under the watchful eye

00:09:58.420 --> 00:10:01.770
of the Warren Court, the
Supreme Court under the tenure

00:10:01.770 --> 00:10:05.330
of Earl Warren, the most
progressive Supreme Court

00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:09.070
in the history of this
country, and that's the vision

00:10:09.070 --> 00:10:11.460
of constitutional law that they taught me.

00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:13.500
And then I graduated, and went out,

00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:16.780
and practiced under a conservative
majority Supreme Court

00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:20.450
for three plus decades, so
I thought this was a great,

00:10:20.450 --> 00:10:23.070
a great opportunity, I
signed on the bottom line,

00:10:23.070 --> 00:10:24.930
I didn't put in a conditional what-if,

00:10:24.930 --> 00:10:27.960
because there was no what if, right?

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:30.300
And I immediately, I
didn't start immediately,

00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:32.640
because I was finishing up
my teaching at Georgetown,

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:37.320
but I, you know, immediately
tasked the ACLU lawyers

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:42.320
to write memos on how we could
advance constitutional law

00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:44.800
under this liberal Supreme Court

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:48.510
that we were sure to be operating under,

00:10:48.510 --> 00:10:51.670
and those are really interesting memos.

00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:53.383
They're now in the wastebasket.

00:10:54.963 --> 00:10:59.207
And obviously, everything
changed on November 8th.

00:11:01.216 --> 00:11:05.403
The, I still hadn't started
to work for the ACLU, but the,

00:11:09.130 --> 00:11:10.600
the Executive Director decided

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:13.550
to introduce me to the national staff

00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:17.610
at a national staff
meeting, which he scheduled

00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:22.500
for November 9th, the
morning after the election.

00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:25.290
You can imagine that staff meeting was not

00:11:25.290 --> 00:11:29.773
about introducing me,
it was about what had,

00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:35.660
what had just, what had just
transpired, and people were,

00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:37.921
you know, many of the staff were,

00:11:37.921 --> 00:11:39.540
you know, in shock, as I'm sure, you know,

00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:41.620
many of your students
were, many of the people

00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:43.180
in this room, probably, were in shock

00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:47.100
because no one ever
thought this could happen,

00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:48.480
and everyone was very concerned

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:52.870
about what it might,
what it might portend.

00:11:52.870 --> 00:11:56.800
And it did change, in many
ways, in fundamental ways,

00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:58.850
the way that we operate,
but in other ways, no,

00:11:58.850 --> 00:12:02.003
I mean, we, we've been around since 1920.

00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:05.360
We've sued Republican presidents,

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:09.340
we've sued Democratic
presidents, we sued the Bushes,

00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:12.320
we sued Clinton, we sued Obama,

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:16.380
so in that respect, you
know, we will sue Trump.

00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:19.220
We have sued Trump, that's
not that much of a change,

00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:23.230
but we went from the possibility

00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:26.110
of working on offense,
and having an inside game

00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:29.120
with a Justice Department that shared some

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:32.340
of our most basic beliefs and values

00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:36.350
to having to play a
largely defensive game,

00:12:36.350 --> 00:12:40.500
and one in which we,
we have to rely largely

00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:45.500
on an outside game, rather
than an inside game.

00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:49.220
But, in many ways, it's times like this

00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:53.720
when organizations like
ours are so critical,

00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:57.070
and so important, and one of the reasons

00:12:57.070 --> 00:13:02.070
that I feel buoyed and hopeful
in this time is the response

00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:06.500
of the citizenry to the
election of Donald Trump.

00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:10.080
So Donald Trump walks
like an authoritarian,

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:12.640
he talks like an authoritarian,

00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:15.940
but he doesn't rule like an authoritarian,

00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:18.410
and the reason he doesn't
rule like an authoritarian,

00:13:18.410 --> 00:13:21.580
at least thus far, is because he can't,

00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:26.230
because there's been significant
resistance from citizens,

00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:31.230
from courts, from civil
society in a variety of ways,

00:13:31.810 --> 00:13:36.100
and those checks are absolutely critical.

00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:38.983
So, you know, there are
many examples of the,

00:13:40.590 --> 00:13:45.010
of the response to
President Trump's election.

00:13:45.010 --> 00:13:50.010
Here, this is our first response,
"we'll see you in court,"

00:13:51.250 --> 00:13:54.740
and for a long time, this
was, this was what you saw,

00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:57.330
Donald Trump's visage on the front page

00:13:57.330 --> 00:14:02.330
of the ACLU website, and
we, two days after that,

00:14:03.930 --> 00:14:07.930
that staff, that staff
meeting, on November 9th,

00:14:07.930 --> 00:14:11.180
we published in The New York Times

00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:14.060
and the Washington Post this letter

00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:17.077
to president-elect Trump,
"For nearly 100 years,

00:14:17.077 --> 00:14:20.237
"the ACLU has stood as the
nation's premier defender

00:14:20.237 --> 00:14:22.527
"of freedom and justice for all,

00:14:22.527 --> 00:14:24.447
"as you assume the
nation's highest office,

00:14:24.447 --> 00:14:27.017
"we must ask you now, as president-elect,

00:14:27.017 --> 00:14:29.357
"to reconsider and change course

00:14:29.357 --> 00:14:32.640
"on certain campaign
promises you have made."

00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:35.500
And we then went through the
campaign promises he had made,

00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:38.670
including the Muslim ban, and said,

00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:43.670
if you carry these promises
through, we'll see you in court.

00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:50.900
And that's what, that's
what we have, we have done,

00:14:51.450 --> 00:14:55.993
we have sued the president
over the Muslim ban,

00:14:56.851 --> 00:14:59.410
on many occasions, and I'll
come back to that in a moment.

00:14:59.410 --> 00:15:04.410
We've sued him over the
attempts to deport Dreamers,

00:15:05.610 --> 00:15:10.460
people who have, have the
protection of the, of DACA,

00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:14.390
those are the young people who
were brought here illegally

00:15:14.390 --> 00:15:16.830
by their parents, and are, but at no fault

00:15:16.830 --> 00:15:18.750
of their own, and are undocumented,

00:15:18.750 --> 00:15:22.360
we sued him over his Voter
Integrity Commission,

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:25.080
which was essentially designed to try to

00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:30.080
create the basis for suppressing the vote.

00:15:30.686 --> 00:15:32.090
We sued him

00:15:33.090 --> 00:15:35.260
over his,

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:37.920
his administration's policy

00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:40.520
of obstructing access

00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:45.030
to young undocumented women who are

00:15:45.030 --> 00:15:46.660
in federal custody

00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:50.283
here, and seek an abortion.

00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:53.090
And his,

00:15:53.090 --> 00:15:57.860
his choice to head up the
Office of Refugee Resettlement,

00:15:57.860 --> 00:16:02.860
a man named Scott Lloyd, who
has no history or experience

00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:08.477
in immigration, but is an
ardent anti-choice person,

00:16:09.990 --> 00:16:14.710
has taken it upon himself
to essentially bar the door.

00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:17.120
When young women who are
detained because they're,

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:21.810
they've been, you know,
captured as undocumented here,

00:16:21.810 --> 00:16:24.250
they learn that they're
pregnant, they choose

00:16:24.250 --> 00:16:27.660
to exercise their constitutional right

00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:31.840
to obtain an abortion,
he has, time and again,

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:34.327
essentially blocked the door, and said,

00:16:34.327 --> 00:16:39.327
"I'm not going to facilitate
your obtaining an abortion."

00:16:39.797 --> 00:16:40.870
"I'm not gonna facilitate,"

00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:44.390
how is he facilitating the
woman obtaining an abortion?

00:16:44.390 --> 00:16:49.320
By opening the gate, so that
she can leave the facility

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:51.630
that she's detained in, in order to go

00:16:51.630 --> 00:16:54.470
to a clinic where she can
get medical treatment.

00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:57.270
And so we've sued him to challenge

00:16:57.270 --> 00:16:59.900
that direct obstruction

00:17:01.083 --> 00:17:05.650
of the right to choose
to terminate a pregnancy.

00:17:05.650 --> 00:17:08.960
We've sued him over the
transgender military ban,

00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:12.070
which he introduced via Twitter,

00:17:12.070 --> 00:17:15.940
without any consultation with
the Joint Chiefs of Staff,

00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:18.450
who had determined that there was no need

00:17:18.450 --> 00:17:23.450
to bar transgender individuals
from serving in the military.

00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:26.570
We've sued him over a policy
that would allow employers

00:17:26.570 --> 00:17:31.570
to deny contraceptive
coverage to their employees

00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:33.020
through their health insurance,

00:17:33.020 --> 00:17:38.020
if they object to their female
employees getting access

00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:42.390
to contraceptive coverage,
putting the employer's moral

00:17:44.878 --> 00:17:49.000
or religious beliefs over
the rights of women to,

00:17:50.870 --> 00:17:54.780
to full medical coverage.

00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:56.740
So we've sued him time
and again, we've had,

00:17:56.740 --> 00:17:59.540
we have five cases in the
Supreme Court this term,

00:17:59.540 --> 00:18:02.113
and in all five, Trump
is on the other side,

00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:06.500
the Masterpiece Cake Shop
case, the Justice Department,

00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:09.840
for the first time in
its history is supporting

00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:13.710
a constitutional exemption
to a non-discrimination law.

00:18:13.710 --> 00:18:17.310
The Justice Department enforces
non-discrimination law,

00:18:17.310 --> 00:18:19.930
that's one of the central responsibilities

00:18:19.930 --> 00:18:22.210
of the Justice Department, and so for them

00:18:22.210 --> 00:18:24.860
to support a constitutional exemption

00:18:24.860 --> 00:18:27.410
to non-discrimination law is remarkable,

00:18:27.410 --> 00:18:30.100
and indeed, unprecedented.

00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:33.010
We're suing, we're on the other side

00:18:33.010 --> 00:18:35.780
in a case involving Ohio's practice

00:18:35.780 --> 00:18:40.560
of purging voters from the voter
rolls if they fail to vote,

00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:43.200
and for 20 years, the Justice Department,

00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:46.520
under Republican, as well as
Democratic administrations,

00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:51.180
supported the view that we're
articulating in that case,

00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:54.580
that the Motor Voter law
prohibits that practice.

00:18:54.580 --> 00:18:58.060
And in fact, the Justice
Department filed an amicus brief,

00:18:58.060 --> 00:19:00.160
a friend of the court brief, in our case,

00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:04.610
supporting our side in
the Court of Appeals.

00:19:04.610 --> 00:19:07.970
But when we prevailed, and
when Ohio took the case

00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:10.620
to the Supreme Court, and
Donald Trump was elected,

00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:12.260
and Jeff Sessions was appointed,

00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:16.080
they reversed their position,
a 20 year consistent position

00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:19.270
on the statute, flipped sides in the case,

00:19:19.270 --> 00:19:21.660
and are opposing us.

00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:25.530
We are, we're suing
over your privacy rights

00:19:25.530 --> 00:19:29.630
with respect to the cell,
the data on your cellphone,

00:19:29.630 --> 00:19:32.360
and the Trump administration's
arguing it should be able

00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:34.110
to get the data on your cellphone,

00:19:34.110 --> 00:19:37.780
as to where you, where
you are at any given time,

00:19:37.780 --> 00:19:41.310
without a warrant,
without going to a judge.

00:19:41.310 --> 00:19:45.730
And, of course, we sued
him over the travel ban,

00:19:45.730 --> 00:19:49.380
that is also before the Supreme Court,

00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:51.810
now, for the second time this term,

00:19:51.810 --> 00:19:54.833
and will be argued in April.

00:19:55.910 --> 00:20:00.030
So, so we told them,
"We'll see you in court,"

00:20:00.030 --> 00:20:02.580
and we have indeed seen them in court,

00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:07.580
and by and large, the courts
have stood up to the president.

00:20:07.890 --> 00:20:11.580
So the courts have
enjoined the Muslim ban,

00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:14.330
repeatedly, three different versions

00:20:14.330 --> 00:20:18.310
of the Muslim ban have
been enjoined, repeatedly.

00:20:18.310 --> 00:20:22.460
The court's enjoined the
transgender military ban,

00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:27.010
the court's barred the Office
of Refugee Resettlement

00:20:27.010 --> 00:20:32.010
from keeping women from their
right to, to obtain abortion,

00:20:34.465 --> 00:20:39.465
the courts have rescinded
President Trump's rescission

00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:44.451
of DACA, the protection for the Dreamers.

00:20:44.451 --> 00:20:47.840
The courts have enjoined the policy

00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:52.300
that would allow employers to
deny contraceptive coverage

00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:55.173
to their employees if they object.

00:20:57.449 --> 00:21:01.250
So, so by and large,
the courts have stood up

00:21:01.250 --> 00:21:04.273
to the president, and I
think that's, you know,

00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:10.170
as it should be, it's not as it always is,

00:21:10.170 --> 00:21:12.630
and, of course, we have not yet heard

00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:15.230
from the Supreme Court on
any of these questions,

00:21:15.230 --> 00:21:18.950
and that's where the rubber
ultimately meets the road.

00:21:18.950 --> 00:21:23.950
But in a time of unified government,

00:21:24.290 --> 00:21:28.100
that is, the same party
controlling the presidency,

00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:31.610
both houses of Congress, and, indeed,

00:21:31.610 --> 00:21:34.083
right now, the Supreme Court,

00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:37.150
the

00:21:37.150 --> 00:21:39.750
courts, nonetheless, continue

00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:43.860
to play an important
role in checking abuse.

00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:47.360
And why is that, well, one, the politics

00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:52.170
of the courts lags behind
the politics of the moment,

00:21:52.170 --> 00:21:56.100
because judges are appointed
by a particular party

00:21:56.100 --> 00:21:59.350
at a particular time, but
then they serve for life,

00:21:59.350 --> 00:22:01.913
and so the courts'

00:22:04.130 --> 00:22:07.580
outlook changes much more slowly than the,

00:22:07.580 --> 00:22:10.300
than Congress or the
president, number one.

00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:12.863
Number two, the courts are,

00:22:15.210 --> 00:22:17.280
their self-definition is

00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:22.280
to be independent checks
applying law to politics,

00:22:23.020 --> 00:22:26.410
and while there is obviously
reason to be skeptical

00:22:26.410 --> 00:22:28.780
that they always do that,
and that it's possible

00:22:28.780 --> 00:22:30.380
to separate law from politics,

00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:35.380
it is critical to their
legitimacy as institutional actors

00:22:35.410 --> 00:22:38.430
to hold true to that ideal,

00:22:38.430 --> 00:22:41.630
and so courts do,

00:22:41.630 --> 00:22:45.150
in many instances, hold
true to that ideal.

00:22:45.150 --> 00:22:49.030
I think, in this instance,
it's also the case

00:22:49.030 --> 00:22:53.350
that courts tend to be
establishment focused,

00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:57.430
you don't get to be a judge
by being a rebel, right?

00:22:57.430 --> 00:23:02.430
You, so courts are establishment oriented,

00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:04.930
whether they're, whether
a judge is appointed

00:23:04.930 --> 00:23:08.090
by a Democrat, or a Republican,

00:23:08.090 --> 00:23:10.710
they have an interest in the status quo,

00:23:10.710 --> 00:23:13.570
the law has an interest in
preserving the status quo,

00:23:13.570 --> 00:23:15.738
and making sure that people, you know,

00:23:15.738 --> 00:23:18.480
can sort of plan their
lives, go about their lives

00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:20.360
without getting too disrupted.

00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:24.380
And President Trump
doesn't seem to care all

00:23:24.380 --> 00:23:26.690
that much about the status quo,

00:23:26.690 --> 00:23:30.660
and he is quite, in
virtually every respect,

00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:33.093
a challenge to the status quo.

00:23:34.150 --> 00:23:38.950
And in his attitudes towards
constitutional norms,

00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:43.123
constitutional rights, and,
indeed, the courts themselves,

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:49.840
he is not only threatening
the rights of individuals,

00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:53.823
but threatening the
institutional role of courts.

00:23:55.060 --> 00:23:59.200
So when the first nationwide

00:24:01.513 --> 00:24:02.800
ban on the,

00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:07.800
travel ban was issued by the
judge in Washington state,

00:24:08.230 --> 00:24:10.950
Trump tweeted, and referred

00:24:10.950 --> 00:24:15.270
to the judge as a "so-called
judge," all right?

00:24:15.270 --> 00:24:18.083
So when the president is,

00:24:21.090 --> 00:24:25.197
shows utter disregard
for basic underpinnings

00:24:26.327 --> 00:24:29.320
and foundations of our
constitutional system,

00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:31.760
it is not surprising

00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:36.450
that courts will be
part of the resistance,

00:24:36.450 --> 00:24:39.650
and indeed, they have, they have stood up

00:24:39.650 --> 00:24:44.650
for the rule of law, for
rights, at least thus far,

00:24:44.650 --> 00:24:47.603
against the, against the president.

00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:51.250
But

00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:54.740
courts are

00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:56.943
by no means enough,

00:24:57.890 --> 00:25:01.430
and it's not these, this
handful of decisions

00:25:01.430 --> 00:25:04.893
that really makes me hopeful,

00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:08.813
you know, it is,

00:25:08.813 --> 00:25:12.970
it is much more the other forms of checks

00:25:12.970 --> 00:25:16.580
and balances that operate at a time

00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:21.580
when one party controls the
executive, the Congress,

00:25:22.580 --> 00:25:25.990
the Supreme Court, and, while we're at it,

00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:29.023
two thirds of the state,
of state governments.

00:25:30.190 --> 00:25:31.640
And that is

00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:35.733
not formal separation of powers,

00:25:37.190 --> 00:25:38.060
but

00:25:38.060 --> 00:25:42.090
the informal checks and balances

00:25:42.090 --> 00:25:43.913
of civil society,

00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:47.933
the press, the academy,

00:25:50.334 --> 00:25:53.990
and religious organizations,

00:25:53.990 --> 00:25:58.080
and civil society
non-profit organizations,

00:25:58.080 --> 00:26:01.233
like the ACLU, or Planned Parenthood.

00:26:02.940 --> 00:26:07.180
At times like this, those are

00:26:07.180 --> 00:26:08.260
critical

00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:14.560
potential sites of resistance,
indeed, that's why,

00:26:14.710 --> 00:26:18.063
when authoritarians take power,

00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:21.540
and exercise authoritarian control,

00:26:21.540 --> 00:26:23.750
don't just walk and talk
like an authoritarian,

00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:28.750
but rule like an authoritarian,
as we've seen in Hungary,

00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:33.673
in Poland, these are their targets,

00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:35.720
right, they target the courts,

00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:38.130
but they also target the universities,

00:26:38.130 --> 00:26:41.630
they target the press,
they target civil society,

00:26:41.630 --> 00:26:44.940
because they, and they
often target religion,

00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:49.940
because these are all places
where citizens come together

00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:53.240
and act collectively in ways

00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:55.610
that can hold the government accountable,

00:26:55.610 --> 00:26:59.653
and can resist abuses of authority.

00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:05.740
This is why the first
amendment is so important,

00:27:05.740 --> 00:27:10.100
it's not just, the first
amendment doesn't just protect

00:27:10.100 --> 00:27:15.100
a right to express yourself,
to discover who you are,

00:27:18.243 --> 00:27:21.620
to be an autonomous human being,

00:27:21.620 --> 00:27:23.873
it protects that value, to be sure.

00:27:24.790 --> 00:27:28.540
But it also is a critical,
plays a critical structural role

00:27:28.540 --> 00:27:32.190
in checking abuse, and it does that

00:27:32.190 --> 00:27:34.460
by protecting precisely

00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:39.760
these forms of civil
society checks and balances,

00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:43.590
a free press, free exercise of religion,

00:27:43.590 --> 00:27:47.720
freedom of speech, freedom of association,

00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:49.420
and freedom of assembly,

00:27:49.420 --> 00:27:53.983
this is how the people hold
a government accountable.

00:27:55.060 --> 00:28:00.060
And what I find most encouraging
about the, the Trump era,

00:28:02.010 --> 00:28:02.843
is

00:28:02.843 --> 00:28:05.710
how energized

00:28:05.710 --> 00:28:10.180
that civil society sector is.

00:28:10.180 --> 00:28:11.878
And we saw it, you know,

00:28:11.878 --> 00:28:16.878
the day after the
president was inaugurated,

00:28:17.060 --> 00:28:20.160
with the women's march,
and just a remarkable,

00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:23.200
nation-wide, world-wide uprising

00:28:24.748 --> 00:28:29.540
of people who came together
to stand up against

00:28:29.540 --> 00:28:34.540
what this newly inaugurated
president stood for.

00:28:34.740 --> 00:28:38.370
And we've seen it since then
in the airport demonstrations,

00:28:38.370 --> 00:28:41.470
in the DACA demonstrations, in the,

00:28:41.470 --> 00:28:44.740
the town halls to protest the efforts

00:28:44.740 --> 00:28:47.350
to repeal the Affordable Care Act,

00:28:47.350 --> 00:28:51.160
in the elections, special
elections in Alabama

00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:52.910
and Virginia, in which people who care

00:28:52.910 --> 00:28:57.360
about civil rights and civil
liberties came out in force,

00:28:57.360 --> 00:28:59.460
and elected

00:28:59.460 --> 00:29:02.990
people who, who, representatives who stood

00:29:02.990 --> 00:29:07.990
for those values in places
where that was unthinkable,

00:29:09.550 --> 00:29:12.183
before Donald Trump was elected.

00:29:13.050 --> 00:29:14.810
We've seen it at the ACLU, I mean,

00:29:14.810 --> 00:29:16.547
many people say to me, you know, well,

00:29:16.547 --> 00:29:20.350
"You started in January, David,
you know, how's it going?"

00:29:20.350 --> 00:29:24.187
And I say, "Well, not bad,
before I started working

00:29:24.187 --> 00:29:28.987
"at the ACLU, we had
400,000 members, today,

00:29:28.987 --> 00:29:33.987
"we have 1.75 million
members," pretty good, right?

00:29:34.215 --> 00:29:37.480
(audience applauds)

00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:40.370
Now, that's the difference,

00:29:40.370 --> 00:29:41.510
for those of you who are students,

00:29:41.510 --> 00:29:45.170
that's the difference between
correlation and causation,

00:29:45.170 --> 00:29:48.360
I don't think I can
take credit for much of

00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:52.870
that increase in our membership,
my dad did join, so I get

00:29:52.870 --> 00:29:57.870
that one, but otherwise, Donald
Trump gets credit, right?

00:29:58.350 --> 00:30:01.160
But really, it's the American
people who get credit,

00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:05.380
they have recognized
that in a time like this,

00:30:05.380 --> 00:30:08.950
organizations like ours,
and it's not just ours,

00:30:08.950 --> 00:30:13.670
Planned Parenthood has
seen unprecedented support,

00:30:13.670 --> 00:30:18.220
the Legal Defense Fund,
lots of newfound support,

00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:20.540
the press, The New York
Times subscriptions,

00:30:20.540 --> 00:30:24.410
Washington Post subscriptions
have never been higher,

00:30:24.410 --> 00:30:28.530
people are responding
to the threat of Trump

00:30:28.530 --> 00:30:31.500
in the way that they know best,

00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:36.500
which is by engaging,
by engaging collectively

00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:39.390
through the institutions of civil society

00:30:39.390 --> 00:30:44.390
that can play a role in curtailing these,

00:30:44.770 --> 00:30:47.600
these sorts of abuses.

00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:49.100
So it's been

00:30:49.100 --> 00:30:52.570
kind of a wild ride at,

00:30:52.570 --> 00:30:55.283
at the ACLU, I mean, one of my,

00:30:56.730 --> 00:30:58.640
the legal director of the Chicago,

00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:01.460
of the Illinois ACLU said to me, you know,

00:31:01.460 --> 00:31:03.517
shortly I had begun, he
said, "You know, David,

00:31:03.517 --> 00:31:05.467
"it's not fair, you started to become,

00:31:05.467 --> 00:31:07.777
"you became the legal
director of the ACLU at a time

00:31:07.777 --> 00:31:10.767
"when it's popular to be the director,

00:31:10.767 --> 00:31:12.781
"to be with the ACLU, right," and he's

00:31:12.781 --> 00:31:16.460
from the Illinois ACLU, the
one that defended the rights

00:31:16.460 --> 00:31:19.673
of the Nazis to mark in
Skokie, so he should know.

00:31:20.710 --> 00:31:24.300
But we have, you know, in
addition to our newfound members,

00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:26.740
we've had thousands of
people coming forward

00:31:26.740 --> 00:31:31.740
to volunteer, lawyers,
non-lawyers, tech people,

00:31:31.860 --> 00:31:35.810
artists, we've had people like Tom Hanks,

00:31:35.810 --> 00:31:38.570
and Tina Fey, and Usher, and all kinds

00:31:38.570 --> 00:31:40.490
of other artists, way too cool for me

00:31:40.490 --> 00:31:44.923
to have ever heard of them
do fundraisers for the ACLU,

00:31:46.727 --> 00:31:50.240
the, one day I walked into my office,

00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:53.130
and there were all these big boxes

00:31:53.130 --> 00:31:54.880
in the hallway outside of my office,

00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:59.880
big, black boxes, and all
these cameras, and what was it,

00:32:00.010 --> 00:32:04.070
it was Vogue magazine,
who had come to the office

00:32:04.070 --> 00:32:05.080
of the ACLU

00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:10.130
to do a feature on women of the ACLU.

00:32:10.130 --> 00:32:12.403
I can guarantee you that in the 100 years

00:32:12.403 --> 00:32:14.180
that the ACLU has been around,

00:32:14.180 --> 00:32:18.280
there has never been a
feature on women of the ACLU,

00:32:18.280 --> 00:32:20.670
much less in Vogue
magazine, and those big,

00:32:20.670 --> 00:32:25.670
black boxes were filled
with really fancy clothes

00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:30.490
and shoes that they dressed the women in,

00:32:30.490 --> 00:32:32.276
because we, 'cause, you know, women

00:32:32.276 --> 00:32:34.010
of the don't ACLU don't dress sufficiently

00:32:34.010 --> 00:32:36.383
for Vogue magazine, so Vogue dressed them.

00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:42.450
But really, you know,
quite, quite something,

00:32:42.450 --> 00:32:44.593
and, you know, it's,

00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:48.680
it is that support

00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:50.680
that I think, you know, supports all

00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:53.650
of us as we do the work,

00:32:53.650 --> 00:32:57.713
as we do the work that we, that we do.

00:32:59.041 --> 00:33:02.170
So let me talk a little bit about

00:33:03.630 --> 00:33:08.470
how this, sort of give an
example, sort of how this

00:33:11.850 --> 00:33:12.883
works.

00:33:15.060 --> 00:33:15.910
So

00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:20.543
let's, let's, you know,
think back to the Muslim ban.

00:33:21.610 --> 00:33:26.610
The Muslim ban was President
Trump's first major initiative,

00:33:26.700 --> 00:33:31.030
and that was not a coincidence, he chose,

00:33:31.030 --> 00:33:33.960
for his first major
initiative, it was issued

00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:38.563
on January 26th, six days
after he took office,

00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:44.323
targeting foreign nationals,

00:33:46.090 --> 00:33:50.940
targeting Muslim foreign
nationals in the name

00:33:50.940 --> 00:33:55.300
of protecting American's
national security.

00:33:55.300 --> 00:33:58.274
Now, historically,

00:33:58.274 --> 00:34:03.190
that kind of measure does pretty well,

00:34:03.190 --> 00:34:06.230
politically, in the United States,

00:34:06.230 --> 00:34:08.140
and in other countries, as well, that is,

00:34:08.140 --> 00:34:11.900
if the government says to the people, hey,

00:34:11.900 --> 00:34:16.000
you're under threat,
we're here to protect you,

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:21.000
and we're not gonna take
away your rights to do this,

00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:24.160
we're gonna take away the
rights of somebody else,

00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:26.530
and the somebody else are foreigners,

00:34:26.530 --> 00:34:29.653
and not just foreigners,
but Muslim foreigners.

00:34:31.530 --> 00:34:36.420
In the aftermath of 9/11, President Bush

00:34:36.420 --> 00:34:40.560
and the Justice Department rounded up

00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:44.780
over 5,000 foreign nationals,

00:34:44.780 --> 00:34:47.220
Arab and Muslim foreign nationals,

00:34:47.220 --> 00:34:50.240
and detained them on suspicion

00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:51.900
that they might be involved with 9/11.

00:34:51.900 --> 00:34:54.770
None of them turned out
to be involved with 9/11,

00:34:54.770 --> 00:34:58.730
but it wasn't, it didn't cause an outcry,

00:34:58.730 --> 00:35:02.900
and the message was, we're targeting them,

00:35:02.900 --> 00:35:05.850
not you, and we're seeking to protect you.

00:35:05.850 --> 00:35:07.770
The same thing happened in 1920,

00:35:07.770 --> 00:35:10.123
when there were a series
of terrorist bombings,

00:35:11.110 --> 00:35:14.180
this is as close as I get
to Thomas Jefferson, 1920,

00:35:14.180 --> 00:35:16.510
there were a series of terrorist
bombings, and the response

00:35:16.510 --> 00:35:20.530
to those terrorist bombings
was the Palmer Raids,

00:35:20.530 --> 00:35:22.350
in which the government went out,

00:35:22.350 --> 00:35:24.700
and rounded up thousands
of foreign nationals,

00:35:24.700 --> 00:35:29.700
none of whom had anything to
do with the terrorist bombings.

00:35:29.970 --> 00:35:34.773
And again, not a huge outcry
from the American people.

00:35:36.340 --> 00:35:39.123
But this time was very different,

00:35:41.028 --> 00:35:44.910
this time there was
resistance from day one.

00:35:46.450 --> 00:35:49.300
The order was issued on a Friday,

00:35:49.300 --> 00:35:54.300
that night we filed the
first case challenging

00:35:55.260 --> 00:35:56.800
the,

00:35:56.800 --> 00:35:57.910
the ban,

00:35:57.910 --> 00:36:00.650
on behalf of two young

00:36:01.670 --> 00:36:04.890
Iraqi men who had been

00:36:04.890 --> 00:36:08.470
given visas to come here after working

00:36:08.470 --> 00:36:11.593
with our military in Iraq.

00:36:13.170 --> 00:36:16.380
They were stopped at JFK
airport, because they were

00:36:16.380 --> 00:36:19.620
from Iraq, and the Muslim ban
covered anyone who was coming

00:36:19.620 --> 00:36:23.020
from Iraq, even those who had
visas, who had been vetted,

00:36:23.020 --> 00:36:25.300
who had been cleared, and
who'd been given visas

00:36:25.300 --> 00:36:28.890
because they had sacrificed for us.

00:36:28.890 --> 00:36:33.332
And so we sued that
night, with the help of a,

00:36:33.332 --> 00:36:36.763
of a clinic of law students
at Yale Law School.

00:36:38.010 --> 00:36:42.343
And the next day, Saturday,
a remarkable thing happened.

00:36:43.420 --> 00:36:47.810
Tens of thousands of Americans rushed out

00:36:47.810 --> 00:36:52.690
to airports to demonstrate,
and this was remarkable

00:36:52.690 --> 00:36:54.703
for at least two reasons, one,

00:36:55.770 --> 00:36:58.830
this was not the way
we historically respond

00:36:58.830 --> 00:37:02.303
when the government
targets them to protect us.

00:37:03.450 --> 00:37:06.400
People were going out to airports not

00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:08.920
to demonstrate for their own rights,

00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:11.230
but for the rights of
others, for the rights

00:37:11.230 --> 00:37:14.450
of foreign nationals, for
the rights of Muslims.

00:37:14.450 --> 00:37:17.220
But the second thing that
makes it remarkable is

00:37:17.220 --> 00:37:19.310
where these demonstrations took place,

00:37:19.310 --> 00:37:22.730
they were at airports,
I don't know about you,

00:37:22.730 --> 00:37:25.080
but the last place I want to be,

00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:28.650
unless I have to go somewhere,
is an airport, right?

00:37:28.650 --> 00:37:32.320
It's a soul crushing environment, and yet,

00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:35.460
tens of thousands of Americans
got off their couches,

00:37:35.460 --> 00:37:40.460
and went out to demonstrate,
to protest on behalf

00:37:40.750 --> 00:37:45.330
of the other, and against
the Trump travel ban.

00:37:45.330 --> 00:37:49.530
They went to airports like
JFK, and Boston Logan Airport,

00:37:49.530 --> 00:37:51.430
and SFO, where there's plenty

00:37:51.430 --> 00:37:53.700
of international flights coming in,

00:37:53.700 --> 00:37:55.440
and people were getting stopped.

00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:58.050
But they also went out to
wholly domestic airports,

00:37:58.050 --> 00:38:01.350
where there were no international
travelers whatsoever,

00:38:01.350 --> 00:38:06.350
people were just, people
were primed, and ready to,

00:38:06.350 --> 00:38:09.963
to stand up, and to act, to engage.

00:38:11.490 --> 00:38:15.590
And it wasn't just, it wasn't just people,

00:38:15.590 --> 00:38:19.820
ordinary people, it was also
all manner of civil society,

00:38:19.820 --> 00:38:22.950
so ultimately, the leading, the presidents

00:38:22.950 --> 00:38:24.830
of all the leading universities signed

00:38:24.830 --> 00:38:27.180
a letter opposing the Trump ban,

00:38:27.180 --> 00:38:30.560
the leading science
organizations all signed

00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:33.733
a petition opposing the Trump ban, the,

00:38:35.693 --> 00:38:40.693
the CEOs of the largest and
most successful corporations

00:38:41.060 --> 00:38:44.090
in Silicon Valley
submitted an amicus brief

00:38:44.090 --> 00:38:46.740
opposing the Trump travel ban.

00:38:46.740 --> 00:38:51.740
And even national security
officials came together

00:38:52.120 --> 00:38:55.790
to oppose the Trump
travel ban, that weekend,

00:38:55.790 --> 00:38:56.983
Michael Hayden,

00:38:58.670 --> 00:38:59.853
who was a,

00:39:01.100 --> 00:39:03.350
the head of the NSA and the CIA,

00:39:03.350 --> 00:39:07.600
under George W. Bush,
he's a, he's a defender

00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:11.370
of the CIA's interrogation
slash torture program,

00:39:11.370 --> 00:39:14.210
I've debated him on
several occasions on that,

00:39:14.210 --> 00:39:16.037
and yet, that weekend, he tweeted,

00:39:16.037 --> 00:39:19.917
"How about that, ACLU
and I in same corner."

00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:26.423
Dick Cheney said this was
un-American, Dick Cheney.

00:39:26.423 --> 00:39:27.860
(audience laughs)

00:39:27.860 --> 00:39:32.860
And Berkeley's own John
Yoo, who came to prominence

00:39:32.940 --> 00:39:36.330
by writing the memos as a lawyer

00:39:36.330 --> 00:39:38.890
in the Justice Department
that authorized the use

00:39:38.890 --> 00:39:42.310
of torture by President Bush,

00:39:42.310 --> 00:39:45.277
he wrote an oped for The
New York Times, saying,

00:39:45.277 --> 00:39:49.420
"This time executive
power has gone too far."

00:39:49.420 --> 00:39:51.320
So there was a remarkable

00:39:53.900 --> 00:39:57.370
voicing of resistance from people,

00:39:57.370 --> 00:40:01.576
from ordinary citizens at airports,

00:40:01.576 --> 00:40:05.730
to the leading university,
scientific organizations,

00:40:05.730 --> 00:40:10.293
businesses, and former
government officials.

00:40:12.090 --> 00:40:17.090
We had a, that was all on that
weekend, so that, our case

00:40:19.251 --> 00:40:21.503
that we filed that Friday night,

00:40:22.430 --> 00:40:25.270
was scheduled for an emergency hearing on

00:40:25.270 --> 00:40:27.023
that Saturday night,

00:40:29.381 --> 00:40:31.760
and it went out on Twitter,

00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:34.540
as these things do,
that there was a hearing

00:40:34.540 --> 00:40:37.200
on the Muslim ban, on Saturday night,

00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:40.880
at the Brooklyn Federal
Courthouse, and this was the scene,

00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:43.590
I'm gonna see if this works,
this was the scene outside

00:40:43.590 --> 00:40:46.373
of the courthouse.

00:40:48.945 --> 00:40:52.970
- [Crowd] ACLU, we are
here, we stand with you!

00:40:52.970 --> 00:40:57.250
- Over 1,000 people
surrounded the courthouse

00:40:57.250 --> 00:41:00.040
on a Saturday night, like, you know,

00:41:00.040 --> 00:41:02.007
how often do you think
on a Saturday night,

00:41:02.007 --> 00:41:03.617
"Hey, what do you want to
do, it's a Saturday night,

00:41:03.617 --> 00:41:06.170
"let's go down to the courthouse."

00:41:06.170 --> 00:41:08.480
They came and surrounded the courthouse,

00:41:08.480 --> 00:41:11.760
it was a cold night, January 27th,

00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:14.324
it was almost as cold as it is here today.

00:41:14.324 --> 00:41:15.801
(audience laughs)

00:41:15.801 --> 00:41:17.627
And they were chanting, "ACLU,

00:41:19.907 --> 00:41:22.740
"we are here, we stand with you."

00:41:22.740 --> 00:41:27.193
Again, never in the history
of the ACLU has that happened,

00:41:28.090 --> 00:41:32.970
and indeed, shortly thereafter,
the ACLU lawyers walked out

00:41:32.970 --> 00:41:35.730
of the courthouse to announce to the crowd

00:41:35.730 --> 00:41:37.030
that the judge has issued

00:41:37.030 --> 00:41:42.030
the first injunction
against the travel ban.

00:41:42.300 --> 00:41:46.323
So, and these things are not,

00:41:46.323 --> 00:41:48.590
and then, then the court

00:41:48.590 --> 00:41:52.830
in Washington state
issued the nationwide ban,

00:41:52.830 --> 00:41:55.800
and then those cases went up on appeal,

00:41:55.800 --> 00:41:59.440
and the Courts of Appeals
affirmed those injunctions,

00:41:59.440 --> 00:42:03.080
and Trump initially
made all kinds of noises

00:42:03.080 --> 00:42:04.840
about appealing, but ultimately decided

00:42:04.840 --> 00:42:07.330
to put out a second version
of the ban, and that, too,

00:42:07.330 --> 00:42:10.270
was struck down, and he's took
that up to the Supreme Court,

00:42:10.270 --> 00:42:12.410
but then just as the court
was to hear argument in

00:42:12.410 --> 00:42:16.205
that case, he put out a
third version of the ban.

00:42:16.205 --> 00:42:19.800
And that one has been
challenged in the courts,

00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:22.760
as well, and has been struck
down by district courts,

00:42:22.760 --> 00:42:25.410
by the Court of Appeals
in the Ninth Circuit here,

00:42:25.410 --> 00:42:27.130
and the Court of Appeals
for the Fourth Circuit

00:42:27.130 --> 00:42:29.887
in Richmond, Virginia, and will be heard

00:42:29.887 --> 00:42:32.630
in the Supreme Court.

00:42:32.630 --> 00:42:36.700
So this is an example, I think, of this,

00:42:36.700 --> 00:42:40.800
the combination of civil society activism

00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:45.310
and courts playing a
critically effective role

00:42:45.310 --> 00:42:48.970
in checking the president's abuses.

00:42:48.970 --> 00:42:51.973
And if you look at, at history,

00:42:53.590 --> 00:42:58.420
what you often see is that dark times

00:42:58.420 --> 00:43:01.060
can lead us to positive results

00:43:02.190 --> 00:43:03.500
if,

00:43:03.500 --> 00:43:05.830
if people respond

00:43:05.830 --> 00:43:10.390
to those dark times by
engaging, by resisting,

00:43:10.390 --> 00:43:13.080
and by acting collectively
through civil society

00:43:13.080 --> 00:43:17.320
to advance a brighter future.

00:43:17.320 --> 00:43:19.510
So the first take, the first amendment,

00:43:19.510 --> 00:43:24.450
the first amendment today
is pretty well settled,

00:43:24.450 --> 00:43:27.120
there is a very strong presumption

00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:30.160
that the government cannot
suppress your speech,

00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:33.150
even if you're advocating crime,

00:43:33.150 --> 00:43:36.010
unless your speech is,

00:43:36.010 --> 00:43:37.830
is intended and likely

00:43:37.830 --> 00:43:42.830
to produce imminent criminal
conduct, a very high bar.

00:43:45.180 --> 00:43:48.030
It was established in a
case involving the KKK,

00:43:48.030 --> 00:43:52.170
Brandenburg versus Ohio, 1960s.

00:43:52.170 --> 00:43:55.390
Similarly, it is established
that you have a right

00:43:55.390 --> 00:43:57.860
to associate even with organizations

00:43:57.860 --> 00:43:59.793
that engage in criminal activity,

00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:05.650
as long as you don't specifically intend

00:44:05.650 --> 00:44:09.403
to further the illegal
ends of the organization.

00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:12.780
That, too, was established in the 1960s

00:44:12.780 --> 00:44:16.620
in a series of Communist Party cases.

00:44:16.620 --> 00:44:18.300
The argument of the government had been

00:44:18.300 --> 00:44:21.840
the Communist Party engages
in illegal activity,

00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:23.270
it seeks to overthrow the United States

00:44:23.270 --> 00:44:25.230
by force and violence, that's a crime,

00:44:25.230 --> 00:44:26.660
and therefore anyone who's associated

00:44:26.660 --> 00:44:30.340
with the Communist Party
can be denied their job,

00:44:30.340 --> 00:44:35.110
can be locked up, punished,
deported, et cetera.

00:44:35.110 --> 00:44:38.560
But ultimately, the court ruled no,

00:44:38.560 --> 00:44:40.756
you have a right to join
the Communist Party,

00:44:40.756 --> 00:44:41.740
you have a right to support
the Communist Party,

00:44:41.740 --> 00:44:44.370
as long as you don't specifically intend

00:44:44.370 --> 00:44:46.050
to further its illegal ends.

00:44:46.050 --> 00:44:50.590
So those are tremendously
significant protections

00:44:50.590 --> 00:44:55.150
of our first amendment
freedoms, but they came out,

00:44:55.150 --> 00:44:57.150
where did they come from?

00:44:57.150 --> 00:45:02.150
They came from a history
of government abuse

00:45:02.290 --> 00:45:07.290
of first amendment rights,
they came from decades

00:45:07.730 --> 00:45:11.530
of the McCarthy era, and the red scare,

00:45:11.530 --> 00:45:16.530
and the targeting of anti-war
activists during World War I,

00:45:17.850 --> 00:45:22.020
and the targeting of anarchists in the,

00:45:22.020 --> 00:45:27.020
in the teens and the 1920s, and
it was out of the experience

00:45:27.530 --> 00:45:28.560
of abuse

00:45:29.820 --> 00:45:32.880
that the court ultimately adopted

00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:37.383
a powerfully protective
view of the first amendment.

00:45:38.390 --> 00:45:40.950
And it, the court didn't do it on its own,

00:45:40.950 --> 00:45:45.050
it was through the work of labor unions,

00:45:45.050 --> 00:45:47.930
of the Communist Party, of organizations

00:45:47.930 --> 00:45:49.750
that represented the Communist Party,

00:45:49.750 --> 00:45:51.120
the National Lawyers Guild,

00:45:51.120 --> 00:45:53.780
and the National Emergency
Civil Liberties Committee,

00:45:53.780 --> 00:45:56.520
of organizations like the ACLU

00:45:56.520 --> 00:45:59.220
to advance a broader protection,

00:45:59.220 --> 00:46:01.870
broader understanding of
first amendment protections.

00:46:02.900 --> 00:46:04.800
In my book, Engines of Liberty,

00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:08.980
which I wrote the year
before I joined the ACLU,

00:46:08.980 --> 00:46:12.727
I looked at a couple other
examples, one is the,

00:46:14.550 --> 00:46:18.320
how did the right to bear arms

00:46:19.680 --> 00:46:24.150
go from being dismissed as a fraud in 1990

00:46:24.150 --> 00:46:27.210
by the Chief Justice of the
Supreme Court, Warren Berger,

00:46:27.210 --> 00:46:30.317
a conservative Republican
appointee, who said that,

00:46:30.317 --> 00:46:32.137
"The notion that the
second amendment protects

00:46:32.137 --> 00:46:34.387
"an individual right to bear arms is one

00:46:34.387 --> 00:46:36.227
"of the greatest frauds perpetrated

00:46:36.227 --> 00:46:41.227
"on the American people in
my lifetime," that was 1990.

00:46:41.990 --> 00:46:45.500
How did it go from being
dismissed as a fraud

00:46:45.500 --> 00:46:47.500
by a conservative Supreme Court justice

00:46:47.500 --> 00:46:52.390
to being recognized as a
constitutional right just less

00:46:52.390 --> 00:46:54.843
than two decades later, in 2008?

00:46:56.170 --> 00:46:58.693
And what the answer is,

00:47:00.190 --> 00:47:05.120
as you, I'm sure, know, the
National Rifle Association.

00:47:05.120 --> 00:47:09.500
It was the work of the
NRA, a group of citizens,

00:47:09.500 --> 00:47:13.450
committed to a particular
vision of constitutional law,

00:47:13.450 --> 00:47:14.830
one that had been dismissed

00:47:14.830 --> 00:47:17.050
by the Supreme Court as fraudulent,

00:47:17.050 --> 00:47:19.220
one that had been rejected
by the federal courts

00:47:19.220 --> 00:47:24.220
for 100 years, it was their
work, their political work

00:47:25.490 --> 00:47:29.370
that led, that created the possibility

00:47:30.360 --> 00:47:33.210
that this right could be recognized.

00:47:33.210 --> 00:47:38.210
And what, what sparked their
engagement in this quest?

00:47:40.690 --> 00:47:42.690
The NRA has been around for a long time,

00:47:42.690 --> 00:47:44.880
but the NRA has not been
a political organization

00:47:44.880 --> 00:47:47.110
for a long time, the NRA started out,

00:47:47.110 --> 00:47:49.380
was founded after the Civil War

00:47:49.380 --> 00:47:51.960
by Union generals who were abashed

00:47:51.960 --> 00:47:56.200
at how bad shots the Union Army was,

00:47:56.200 --> 00:47:58.140
and so they created the NRA to, like,

00:47:58.140 --> 00:48:00.760
train people to be better marksmen.

00:48:00.760 --> 00:48:03.580
And it was a marksmanship
and hunting organization

00:48:03.580 --> 00:48:07.820
for, you know, over 100
years, then, in the '60s,

00:48:07.820 --> 00:48:11.780
there was the uprisings, and the violence,

00:48:11.780 --> 00:48:15.380
and the assassinations, and it led 1968

00:48:15.380 --> 00:48:20.260
to the most aggressive federal
gun control legislation

00:48:20.260 --> 00:48:23.750
in American history, the
Gun Control Act of 1968.

00:48:23.750 --> 00:48:26.763
And it was only in response to that,

00:48:27.710 --> 00:48:32.710
considered a disaster by
the NRA and its members,

00:48:33.030 --> 00:48:35.620
that they created a political arm,

00:48:35.620 --> 00:48:38.570
and undertook a political campaign,

00:48:38.570 --> 00:48:41.850
which was designed to instantiate

00:48:41.850 --> 00:48:44.020
and establish an individual
right to bear arms.

00:48:44.020 --> 00:48:48.240
And they did it incrementally,
they did it in the states,

00:48:48.240 --> 00:48:50.720
they did it through legislation,

00:48:50.720 --> 00:48:52.720
they did it through electoral politics,

00:48:52.720 --> 00:48:57.720
they did it by arguing cases
in state court, and they,

00:48:58.420 --> 00:49:01.300
and ultimately, they were able to

00:49:02.250 --> 00:49:04.810
put, get all 50 states

00:49:04.810 --> 00:49:08.220
on board as protecting an
individual right to bear arms

00:49:08.220 --> 00:49:11.610
by the time the Supreme Court
took up the question in 2008.

00:49:11.610 --> 00:49:13.640
So under state law, or
state constitutions,

00:49:13.640 --> 00:49:15.760
the states had already
recognized an individual right

00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:19.900
to bear arms, they got
Congress to support the notion

00:49:19.900 --> 00:49:22.020
of an individual right to
bear arms in several pieces

00:49:22.020 --> 00:49:25.510
of legislation, they
got the executive branch

00:49:25.510 --> 00:49:27.510
to support an individual
right to bear arms

00:49:27.510 --> 00:49:29.630
when George Bush was
elected with their support,

00:49:29.630 --> 00:49:31.700
and John Ashcroft was
made the Attorney General,

00:49:31.700 --> 00:49:33.460
a longtime NRA member,

00:49:33.460 --> 00:49:35.843
and they immediately wrote the
Attorney General, and said,

00:49:35.843 --> 00:49:37.753
"Dear John, what do you think

00:49:37.753 --> 00:49:40.167
"about the Justice
Department's longtime view

00:49:40.167 --> 00:49:41.737
"that the second amendment doesn't protect

00:49:41.737 --> 00:49:44.060
"an individual right to bear arms?"

00:49:44.060 --> 00:49:45.357
And he wrote back immediately, and said,

00:49:45.357 --> 00:49:49.240
"I think it's crazy," and
he reversed a position

00:49:49.240 --> 00:49:51.050
that the Justice Department
had taken for decades,

00:49:51.050 --> 00:49:54.220
and got a 100 page memo written

00:49:54.220 --> 00:49:55.870
by the Office of Legal Counsel

00:49:55.870 --> 00:49:58.850
on why there is an individual
right to bear arms.

00:49:58.850 --> 00:50:02.540
And so when the case came up
to the Supreme Court in 2008,

00:50:02.540 --> 00:50:06.520
the NRA had already succeeded
in getting the states,

00:50:06.520 --> 00:50:08.900
the Congress, and the executive branch

00:50:08.900 --> 00:50:11.320
to endorse this concept, not that hard,

00:50:11.320 --> 00:50:12.930
then, to get the Supreme Court to do it.

00:50:12.930 --> 00:50:17.930
But what sparked them to do
it was, from their standpoint,

00:50:18.560 --> 00:50:23.060
a loss, a big loss in the Gun Control Act.

00:50:23.060 --> 00:50:28.060
So they, the NRA understands
the democratic underpinnings

00:50:28.420 --> 00:50:31.650
of constitutional rights,
another story I tell

00:50:31.650 --> 00:50:36.030
in that book is the story of
the marriage equality folks.

00:50:36.030 --> 00:50:39.180
How did marriage equality
go from unthinkable,

00:50:39.180 --> 00:50:42.230
which is what it was in, 25 years ago,

00:50:42.230 --> 00:50:44.590
to inevitable, which
is what it was in 2015,

00:50:44.590 --> 00:50:48.030
when the Supreme Court
decided that there indeed is

00:50:48.030 --> 00:50:50.230
a constitutional right
to marriage equality?

00:50:51.070 --> 00:50:55.080
And the answer is the same, the NRA, no,

00:50:55.080 --> 00:50:58.960
the answer is the same, it is
civil society organizations,

00:50:58.960 --> 00:51:03.670
who took a vision that
was rejected in the law,

00:51:03.670 --> 00:51:07.990
and worked in a variety
of forums, through people,

00:51:07.990 --> 00:51:10.860
to advance a different conception

00:51:10.860 --> 00:51:13.540
that made it possible
to prevail on the claim.

00:51:13.540 --> 00:51:16.850
So, in 1972, a gay couple argued

00:51:16.850 --> 00:51:19.300
that they had a right to be married,

00:51:19.300 --> 00:51:21.300
and they relied on the
equal protection clause

00:51:21.300 --> 00:51:23.300
of the constitution, and
the due process clause

00:51:23.300 --> 00:51:25.560
of the constitution, and
the Supreme Court thought

00:51:25.560 --> 00:51:28.460
so little of the argument
that they dismissed it

00:51:28.460 --> 00:51:29.467
with a single sentence, and said,

00:51:29.467 --> 00:51:33.670
"It doesn't even raise a serious
question," that was 1972.

00:51:33.670 --> 00:51:36.950
2015, the court recognized
a constitutional right

00:51:36.950 --> 00:51:39.490
to marry, on the basis of what?

00:51:39.490 --> 00:51:42.150
Equal protection, and
the due process clause,

00:51:42.150 --> 00:51:46.683
the exact same arguments, so
the arguments didn't change,

00:51:47.960 --> 00:51:50.300
the court, the court changed, right,

00:51:50.300 --> 00:51:53.750
the court in 2015 was different
from the court in 1972,

00:51:53.750 --> 00:51:57.540
but if anything, the court
in 2015 was more conservative

00:51:57.540 --> 00:51:59.790
than the court in 1972,
that was the tail end

00:51:59.790 --> 00:52:02.253
of the Warren court.

00:52:03.697 --> 00:52:07.910
2015 was, you know, the Roberts court,

00:52:09.010 --> 00:52:13.860
and yet, the court in 2015
recognized the right, so the law,

00:52:13.860 --> 00:52:17.300
the legal arguments didn't
change, the court, if anything,

00:52:17.300 --> 00:52:19.530
changed to become more conservative,

00:52:19.530 --> 00:52:22.640
so what explains the change?

00:52:22.640 --> 00:52:25.370
What explains the change
is the world changed,

00:52:25.370 --> 00:52:27.560
and how did the world
change, the world changed

00:52:27.560 --> 00:52:29.850
because groups like
Lambda Legal Defense Fund,

00:52:29.850 --> 00:52:33.670
Freedom to Marry, gay and
lesbian advocates and defenders,

00:52:33.670 --> 00:52:36.830
the ACLU Gay and Lesbian Rights Project,

00:52:36.830 --> 00:52:40.840
worked collectively,
incrementally, patiently,

00:52:42.200 --> 00:52:45.290
over 30 years to establish

00:52:47.060 --> 00:52:49.420
steps on the road

00:52:49.420 --> 00:52:51.660
to recognizing marriage equality.

00:52:51.660 --> 00:52:54.080
And they didn't go for
it in one fell swoop,

00:52:54.080 --> 00:52:57.570
they did in incrementally,
they started in the states,

00:52:57.570 --> 00:52:59.360
they got progressive cities

00:52:59.360 --> 00:53:02.430
to recognize domestic
partnerships for gay couples,

00:53:02.430 --> 00:53:04.820
they got progressive counties

00:53:04.820 --> 00:53:06.500
to pass anti-discrimination laws

00:53:06.500 --> 00:53:10.240
that included sexual
orientation, they got some courts

00:53:10.240 --> 00:53:15.240
and some progressive states
to recognize gay families in,

00:53:15.810 --> 00:53:19.283
under family law, and
adoption rules, and the like.

00:53:20.260 --> 00:53:23.230
And only then did they make an argument

00:53:23.230 --> 00:53:25.980
that there's a right to marriage,

00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:28.003
and they made it first in Vermont,

00:53:28.990 --> 00:53:32.423
in a state court, on state
constitutional grounds,

00:53:33.728 --> 00:53:36.840
and, and won civil unions there,

00:53:36.840 --> 00:53:38.270
and then took it to Massachusetts,

00:53:38.270 --> 00:53:41.290
and made the same, same
arguments in Massachusetts

00:53:41.290 --> 00:53:42.830
on state constitutional grounds,

00:53:42.830 --> 00:53:44.270
not federal constitutional grounds,

00:53:44.270 --> 00:53:46.640
'cause if they made a federal
constitutional argument,

00:53:46.640 --> 00:53:48.180
it could go to the Supreme Court,

00:53:48.180 --> 00:53:50.040
where they knew they would lose.

00:53:50.040 --> 00:53:51.570
And so they kept it to the states,

00:53:51.570 --> 00:53:54.500
where the, the state
supreme court is the final,

00:53:54.500 --> 00:53:56.970
is the final arbiter.

00:53:56.970 --> 00:53:59.920
But there, too, what, what sort

00:53:59.920 --> 00:54:02.460
of launched this whole movement

00:54:02.460 --> 00:54:06.973
for gay rights was a series of losses,

00:54:08.130 --> 00:54:10.970
the murder, the homophobic murder

00:54:10.970 --> 00:54:14.820
of Matthew Shepard, the AIDs crisis,

00:54:14.820 --> 00:54:16.980
and the failure and
refusal of the government

00:54:16.980 --> 00:54:20.220
to do enough to respond to a crisis

00:54:20.220 --> 00:54:23.430
that was specifically affecting,

00:54:23.430 --> 00:54:26.513
at that time, anyway, the gay community.

00:54:27.750 --> 00:54:31.080
Along the way, proposition eight, right,

00:54:31.080 --> 00:54:33.420
which people in this room remember,

00:54:33.420 --> 00:54:36.010
proposition eight, when the Supreme Court

00:54:36.010 --> 00:54:38.200
of California recognized
marriage equality,

00:54:38.200 --> 00:54:41.940
it was put on the ballot, and in 2008,

00:54:41.940 --> 00:54:43.850
in the most liberal state in the country,

00:54:43.850 --> 00:54:47.100
maybe except for Vermont, California,

00:54:47.100 --> 00:54:50.270
in a year when Barack Obama was elected,

00:54:50.270 --> 00:54:52.580
the first black president was elected,

00:54:52.580 --> 00:54:54.493
marriage equality lost,

00:54:55.440 --> 00:54:58.920
lost in a popular
referendum in California.

00:54:58.920 --> 00:55:01.363
That was a devastating loss, but it,

00:55:02.840 --> 00:55:07.133
it sparked a renewed
commitment to engage in

00:55:08.263 --> 00:55:12.707
activism to advance the
notion of marriage equality,

00:55:12.707 --> 00:55:17.090
and it caused the groups to
reconsider how they were arguing

00:55:17.090 --> 00:55:21.360
for marriage equality, and
shifting from a rights framework

00:55:21.360 --> 00:55:23.900
in their arguments to a love
and commitment framework,

00:55:23.900 --> 00:55:26.550
which was much, turned out
to be much more effective

00:55:26.550 --> 00:55:29.250
at bringing persuadable people,

00:55:29.250 --> 00:55:33.460
people on the fence to their side.

00:55:33.460 --> 00:55:35.940
So, so dark times

00:55:36.870 --> 00:55:37.820
can often

00:55:38.700 --> 00:55:40.470
inspire

00:55:40.470 --> 00:55:43.500
people to come together and act in ways

00:55:43.500 --> 00:55:47.610
that, advance the ball
from their perspective,

00:55:47.610 --> 00:55:50.140
whether it's an ACLU and
first amendment rights,

00:55:50.140 --> 00:55:53.543
whether it's the NRA, and
the right to bear arms,

00:55:54.654 --> 00:55:56.970
or gay rights groups,

00:55:56.970 --> 00:55:58.913
and marriage equality.

00:55:59.920 --> 00:56:00.753
So,

00:56:02.150 --> 00:56:05.633
so in a very real sense,

00:56:06.680 --> 00:56:11.680
how this period will
ultimately be seen is up to us.

00:56:12.070 --> 00:56:15.190
It is possible that this is the first step

00:56:15.190 --> 00:56:19.130
on the road to authoritarianism
in the United States,

00:56:19.130 --> 00:56:22.010
certainly Donald Trump
exhibits all the features

00:56:22.010 --> 00:56:26.650
of authoritarian leaders,
but it is also possible

00:56:26.650 --> 00:56:29.150
that we will look back
on this period 10 years

00:56:29.150 --> 00:56:34.150
from now as a dark time that, nonetheless,

00:56:34.570 --> 00:56:38.490
inspired and catalyzed the citizenry

00:56:38.490 --> 00:56:39.840
to step up

00:56:39.840 --> 00:56:43.300
and speak out in favor of

00:56:44.280 --> 00:56:47.710
visions of civil rights
and civil liberties

00:56:47.710 --> 00:56:52.553
that reflect this country
at its, at its best.

00:56:53.560 --> 00:56:55.960
And I think we've seen many signs of that,

00:56:55.960 --> 00:56:58.880
the most recent sign of that, I think,

00:56:58.880 --> 00:57:02.750
is the high school
students who've responded

00:57:02.750 --> 00:57:06.830
to the mass shooting in Florida, how?

00:57:06.830 --> 00:57:10.033
By engaging in citizen activism,

00:57:11.020 --> 00:57:15.120
and it's quite possible that they will

00:57:15.120 --> 00:57:18.250
shift the debate

00:57:18.250 --> 00:57:21.230
on gun rights and gun control

00:57:22.080 --> 00:57:26.670
in a direction that favors a gun control,

00:57:26.670 --> 00:57:31.670
but the very willingness of
them to get out there and speak,

00:57:32.240 --> 00:57:34.530
this is not the first shooting,

00:57:34.530 --> 00:57:38.610
mass shooting at a high
school, the very willingness

00:57:38.610 --> 00:57:42.270
of them to take this action
up in their own hands,

00:57:42.270 --> 00:57:46.170
in their own voices, I
think is a reflection

00:57:46.170 --> 00:57:50.670
of what they have seen since
Donald Trump was elected,

00:57:50.670 --> 00:57:53.520
in the women's march, in
the airport demonstrations,

00:57:53.520 --> 00:57:55.923
in the DACA demonstrations,

00:57:55.923 --> 00:58:00.923
in the town halls around the
ACA, in the special elections,

00:58:01.620 --> 00:58:06.620
and now, in the effort
to advance gun control.

00:58:08.090 --> 00:58:12.020
So one of the things
we've done at the ACLU is

00:58:12.020 --> 00:58:17.020
to recognize that the fight
here is not simply a legal fight

00:58:18.040 --> 00:58:21.210
in the courts, it is a fight of all of us,

00:58:21.210 --> 00:58:25.570
and those 1.75 million people
who have come to join us,

00:58:25.570 --> 00:58:28.640
they don't want, just want that card,

00:58:28.640 --> 00:58:31.650
you know, in the mail, or emailed to them.

00:58:31.650 --> 00:58:35.040
They don't just want to get, you know,

00:58:35.040 --> 00:58:39.700
an inordinate number of email
action alerts in their inbox,

00:58:39.700 --> 00:58:42.000
they actually want to take action.

00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:43.750
So one of the things we did was

00:58:43.750 --> 00:58:48.020
to create something called a People Power,

00:58:48.020 --> 00:58:50.450
which has, I think, an
unfortunately sort of

00:58:52.238 --> 00:58:54.590
'60s kind of a name to it,

00:58:54.590 --> 00:58:56.150
it seems a little old-fashioned to me,

00:58:56.150 --> 00:58:59.187
but we created People Power.

00:58:59.187 --> 00:59:04.187
And what People Power is
is a platform to encourage

00:59:04.530 --> 00:59:08.320
and facilitate local activism

00:59:08.320 --> 00:59:10.980
by citizens who care about civil liberties

00:59:10.980 --> 00:59:14.850
and civil rights in a coordinated fashion,

00:59:14.850 --> 00:59:19.660
but a decentralized and
local, through decentralized

00:59:19.660 --> 00:59:21.130
and local action.

00:59:21.130 --> 00:59:25.280
And so the first campaign,
which was launched

00:59:25.280 --> 00:59:28.889
with a video, an hour-long
video presentation done,

00:59:28.889 --> 00:59:33.889
shot live in Miami, Florida,
was about sanctuary cities,

00:59:33.980 --> 00:59:36.110
it was about getting citizens together

00:59:36.110 --> 00:59:38.090
to encourage their towns and cities

00:59:38.090 --> 00:59:40.160
to adopt sanctuary policies.

00:59:40.160 --> 00:59:43.970
And over a million
people watched the video,

00:59:43.970 --> 00:59:47.150
people watched it in house
parties across this country

00:59:47.150 --> 00:59:50.230
in every state, multiple house parties,

00:59:50.230 --> 00:59:54.610
and then we gave them
suggestions for how to go out

00:59:54.610 --> 00:59:58.860
and seek to encourage
their local governments

00:59:58.860 --> 01:00:01.900
to respect the rights of immigrants.

01:00:01.900 --> 01:00:03.503
The same, the same thing,

01:00:05.280 --> 01:00:10.280
the most recent campaign is a
campaign about voting rights,

01:00:10.280 --> 01:00:13.670
let the people vote, and we have, again,

01:00:13.670 --> 01:00:16.070
we launched it through a video,

01:00:16.070 --> 01:00:19.490
a live videotape presentation
that people were invited

01:00:19.490 --> 01:00:24.090
to watch in house parties across
this country, and they did.

01:00:24.090 --> 01:00:27.380
And we have state specific campaigns

01:00:27.380 --> 01:00:31.880
in all 50 states that people can take up

01:00:31.880 --> 01:00:35.340
and act upon, and that's, I think,

01:00:35.340 --> 01:00:38.680
a tremendous, tremendously important part,

01:00:38.680 --> 01:00:43.680
it is grassroots mobilization
in defense of civil liberties.

01:00:44.330 --> 01:00:48.270
Why is the NRA so
powerful, it is so powerful

01:00:48.270 --> 01:00:51.650
because it has not 1.75 million members,

01:00:51.650 --> 01:00:56.650
but five million members,
and it has 15 million others

01:00:57.040 --> 01:01:01.340
who think they're members,
but don't pay their dues.

01:01:01.340 --> 01:01:04.410
And when I interview the
NRA officials about this,

01:01:04.410 --> 01:01:06.257
they said, "Well, we'd
love to have their dues,

01:01:06.257 --> 01:01:08.117
"but what we really want is for them

01:01:08.117 --> 01:01:09.647
"to identify as NRA members,

01:01:09.647 --> 01:01:12.427
"because that means we
have 20 million people

01:01:12.427 --> 01:01:15.667
"that we can reach out to to engage

01:01:15.667 --> 01:01:19.077
"when we think gun
rights are under attack."

01:01:19.970 --> 01:01:23.833
And so they have 20
million people, one right.

01:01:24.670 --> 01:01:29.020
We have 1.75 million
people, the whole rest

01:01:29.020 --> 01:01:33.320
of the Bill of Rights, so
we've still got a ways to go,

01:01:33.320 --> 01:01:37.686
but what they have, what they've shown is

01:01:37.686 --> 01:01:41.697
that the strongest support of civil rights

01:01:41.697 --> 01:01:43.763
and civil liberties is not the court,

01:01:45.050 --> 01:01:47.520
but it is the people, and indeed,

01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:50.900
even after the Supreme Court
recognized an individual right

01:01:50.900 --> 01:01:54.800
to bear arms, in the
DC versus Heller case,

01:01:54.800 --> 01:01:57.660
in 2008, it is not the second amendment

01:01:58.650 --> 01:02:01.010
that stops, that protects gun rights,

01:02:01.010 --> 01:02:05.560
and stops gun control
legislation, it is the NRA,

01:02:05.560 --> 01:02:08.710
because the NRA is able to stop laws

01:02:08.710 --> 01:02:11.610
from getting enacted that would
clearly be constitutional,

01:02:13.150 --> 01:02:15.260
and it is able to get laws enacted

01:02:15.260 --> 01:02:19.060
that protect gun rights that
clearly would not be required.

01:02:19.060 --> 01:02:21.470
The court in the Heller
case didn't say you can't

01:02:21.470 --> 01:02:23.340
regulate guns, it said guns are subject

01:02:23.340 --> 01:02:24.510
to reasonable regulation,

01:02:24.510 --> 01:02:26.660
and they gave all kinds of examples.

01:02:26.660 --> 01:02:29.210
So it's the political check of the NRA,

01:02:29.210 --> 01:02:31.460
not the constitutional check of the courts

01:02:31.460 --> 01:02:34.510
that is the ultimate
protector of that right.

01:02:34.510 --> 01:02:38.780
And what may happen now is that the

01:02:38.780 --> 01:02:42.940
high school students may give

01:02:42.940 --> 01:02:46.520
impetus to a similar local,

01:02:46.520 --> 01:02:50.450
you know, a state by state campaign

01:02:50.450 --> 01:02:52.860
to push back against the NRA, something

01:02:52.860 --> 01:02:57.860
that we really haven't
had in this country yet.

01:02:58.110 --> 01:03:02.090
So People Power is one of
the ways that we've responded

01:03:02.090 --> 01:03:04.070
to Trump, another way we've responded is

01:03:04.070 --> 01:03:06.123
through social media,

01:03:08.142 --> 01:03:12.040
and, you know, here, Donald
Trump has shown us the power

01:03:12.040 --> 01:03:12.940
of social media, right?

01:03:12.940 --> 01:03:17.050
He can speak directly
to the American people

01:03:17.050 --> 01:03:19.963
through his Twitter account,
for better or for worse.

01:03:21.470 --> 01:03:23.870
But it's not just Donald
Trump that can do that,

01:03:24.728 --> 01:03:26.650
I, in my second week on the job,

01:03:26.650 --> 01:03:30.150
I sat in on a meeting
of our coms department,

01:03:30.150 --> 01:03:32.790
our communications department,
and it was amazing,

01:03:32.790 --> 01:03:35.220
it was like, it was like
being in a newsroom.

01:03:35.220 --> 01:03:37.107
There were 30 people, and
they'd get up, and say,

01:03:37.107 --> 01:03:39.437
"Well, this is, this is the
video we created this week,

01:03:39.437 --> 01:03:41.507
"and this is the issue that we're pushing,

01:03:41.507 --> 01:03:43.457
"and we got this interview,
and that interview,

01:03:43.457 --> 01:03:47.037
"and this many hits,
and here's what happened

01:03:47.037 --> 01:03:48.217
"on the piece of legislation

01:03:48.217 --> 01:03:51.190
"that was at issue in this state."

01:03:51.190 --> 01:03:55.930
And it was, it was remarkable,
and I said to them,

01:03:55.930 --> 01:03:59.677
you know, "When I started
out as a civil rights lawyer

01:03:59.677 --> 01:04:01.217
"with the Center for
Constitutional Rights,

01:04:01.217 --> 01:04:03.847
"a scrappier, smaller version of the ACLU,

01:04:03.847 --> 01:04:07.007
"back in the 1980s, we
had a coms department,

01:04:07.007 --> 01:04:10.730
"it was one guy, he was the PR guy."

01:04:10.730 --> 01:04:13.550
And what would he do, he
would file a press release

01:04:13.550 --> 01:04:17.640
when we filed a lawsuit, he
would file a press release

01:04:17.640 --> 01:04:20.860
when we had a hearing, he
would file a press release

01:04:20.860 --> 01:04:22.800
when we won a lawsuit,

01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:24.930
and sometimes he'd file
a press release even

01:04:24.930 --> 01:04:27.650
when we lost a lawsuit, right, but,

01:04:27.650 --> 01:04:29.510
and what was he doing
with those press releases?

01:04:29.510 --> 01:04:33.710
Trying to get the media,
especially The New York Times,

01:04:33.710 --> 01:04:37.440
to cover our cases,
well, we still do that,

01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:39.990
we still try to get The New
York Times to cover our cases,

01:04:39.990 --> 01:04:44.990
and they do, but we can
speak to the people directly.

01:04:45.320 --> 01:04:49.960
We have, you know, incredible
reach now through Facebook,

01:04:49.960 --> 01:04:53.920
and Twitter, and Instagram,
that we can speak

01:04:53.920 --> 01:04:57.130
to the people directly,
and in that coms meeting

01:04:57.130 --> 01:05:00.820
of the, of the, you know, 30 or so causes

01:05:00.820 --> 01:05:03.880
that we were advancing in that prior week,

01:05:03.880 --> 01:05:05.740
through the various campaigns,

01:05:05.740 --> 01:05:10.000
maybe 15% of them were cases
that we'd actually filed.

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:13.700
But 85% of them were
issues we cared about,

01:05:13.700 --> 01:05:14.920
and that we were fighting on,

01:05:14.920 --> 01:05:17.040
but we were fighting
through public education,

01:05:17.040 --> 01:05:21.910
through mobilizing people,
not through relying on courts.

01:05:21.910 --> 01:05:26.228
And that has led to some really, I think,

01:05:26.228 --> 01:05:29.430
interesting work by the, by the ACLU.

01:05:29.430 --> 01:05:34.430
Here's one campaign we
did, we took out ad space,

01:05:34.960 --> 01:05:37.810
this is in Times Square, in New York,

01:05:37.810 --> 01:05:40.410
for an ad, and the text there,

01:05:40.410 --> 01:05:43.360
for those of you who can
read Arabic, you'll know,

01:05:43.360 --> 01:05:44.790
so I don't need to tell you,

01:05:44.790 --> 01:05:46.890
for those of you who can't read Arabic,

01:05:46.890 --> 01:05:48.850
the text is the first amendment

01:05:48.850 --> 01:05:51.170
of the United States constitution.

01:05:51.170 --> 01:05:55.970
And we, it was a billboard that changed,

01:05:55.970 --> 01:06:00.930
and it went from English
to Spanish to Arabic,

01:06:00.930 --> 01:06:02.883
just the text of the first amendment.

01:06:04.370 --> 01:06:07.290
We also, oh, this is the
women of the ACLU dressed

01:06:07.290 --> 01:06:12.043
in their Vogue costumes, excellent.

01:06:14.120 --> 01:06:17.450
Those blue ribbons, this
is Lin-Manuel Miranda,

01:06:17.450 --> 01:06:20.210
and Emma Stone,

01:06:20.210 --> 01:06:24.920
wearing ACLU blue ribbons
at the Academy Awards,

01:06:24.920 --> 01:06:27.006
again, never before in the history

01:06:27.006 --> 01:06:31.370
of our organization have we
had anything like this kind

01:06:31.370 --> 01:06:34.140
of support, but it was our
communications department

01:06:34.140 --> 01:06:37.960
that reached out to people,
and came up with this idea

01:06:37.960 --> 01:06:42.630
of let's give a shout out
to the work of the ACLU,

01:06:42.630 --> 01:06:45.660
from voices that people pay attention to,

01:06:45.660 --> 01:06:50.660
whether they are, you know,
likely collaborators or not.

01:06:51.130 --> 01:06:52.940
This is a little video

01:06:53.820 --> 01:06:58.723
that announces a education
campaign we did about the,

01:07:00.280 --> 01:07:01.850
about the Muslim ban one year

01:07:01.850 --> 01:07:04.423
after it had been put in place.

01:07:05.304 --> 01:07:08.387
(slow ambient music)

01:08:04.970 --> 01:08:05.803
So,

01:08:07.580 --> 01:08:09.460
and then, if you go to that site,

01:08:09.460 --> 01:08:12.360
what we did was collect the stories

01:08:12.360 --> 01:08:16.080
of people whose lives had been disrupted,

01:08:16.080 --> 01:08:20.260
like the woman who tells that
story, by the Muslim ban.

01:08:20.260 --> 01:08:22.920
So other than the fact that
we use "impact" as a verb,

01:08:22.920 --> 01:08:27.920
which I cannot stand, a
fantastic effort to get people,

01:08:28.200 --> 01:08:31.410
to reach people by telling stories

01:08:31.410 --> 01:08:35.040
about the real life
impacts of these abuses,

01:08:35.040 --> 01:08:38.120
and to encourage this
continuing involvement.

01:08:38.120 --> 01:08:38.953
So let me,

01:08:40.490 --> 01:08:43.900
let me, I'm coming to a close,

01:08:43.900 --> 01:08:46.260
I want to show you this video,

01:08:46.260 --> 01:08:50.050
which is one we made
at the end of the year,

01:08:50.050 --> 01:08:53.850
to mark the first year
of the Trump campaign,

01:08:53.850 --> 01:08:56.020
and I think it says, you know,

01:08:56.020 --> 01:08:58.740
more eloquently than I just have,

01:08:58.740 --> 01:09:00.190
what I've been talking about,

01:09:00.190 --> 01:09:03.350
and then I'll have two
more words, and we'll be,

01:09:03.350 --> 01:09:05.206
and I'd love to hear your questions.

01:09:05.206 --> 01:09:07.623
(slow music)

01:09:26.830 --> 01:09:29.860
- We are here doing some
hard work for our big march,

01:09:29.860 --> 01:09:34.860
January 21st, 2017, we have
to make our voices heard.

01:09:34.943 --> 01:09:37.360
(slow music)

01:09:38.370 --> 01:09:40.300
- [Woman] Any woman's
right is a human right,

01:09:40.300 --> 01:09:42.140
it's very important
that we stand together,

01:09:42.140 --> 01:09:43.423
march in solidarity.

01:09:50.865 --> 01:09:55.082
- [Crowd] No ban, no fear,
get the (mumbles) off of here.

01:09:55.082 --> 01:09:58.665
No hate, no fear,
Muslims are welcome here!

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.790
- [Reporter] Yeah, many
bodega owners rallying

01:10:02.790 --> 01:10:06.130
and praying in response to the
president's immigration ban,

01:10:06.130 --> 01:10:08.833
hundreds have closed their
stores this afternoon.

01:10:12.310 --> 01:10:15.360
- [Woman] We're joining up to
write a bunch of postcards,

01:10:15.360 --> 01:10:16.640
figuring out what we can do,

01:10:16.640 --> 01:10:18.783
what resources we have as a community.

01:10:22.180 --> 01:10:23.800
- [Reporter] In Tempi, a special kind

01:10:23.800 --> 01:10:25.640
of bake sale this weekend.

01:10:25.640 --> 01:10:27.950
- [Reporter] This bake sale
is more about community,

01:10:27.950 --> 01:10:31.300
sharing culture, and helping
refugees build a life

01:10:31.300 --> 01:10:32.133
in a new place.

01:10:34.520 --> 01:10:36.900
- [Reporter] Hundreds of
(mumbles) students walk out

01:10:36.900 --> 01:10:39.423
of school, their message,
we stand with Dreamers.

01:10:40.539 --> 01:10:42.956
(slow music)

01:10:45.080 --> 01:10:46.110
- [Reporter] From coast to coast,

01:10:46.110 --> 01:10:48.790
the players putting on
an unprecedented display

01:10:48.790 --> 01:10:50.403
of solidarity for their league.

01:10:56.450 --> 01:10:58.130
- I have never talked
about my case in public.

01:10:58.130 --> 01:10:59.600
- This is probably the first time

01:10:59.600 --> 01:11:02.150
I've ever really talked about it.

01:11:02.150 --> 01:11:02.983
- It happened to me, too.

01:11:02.983 --> 01:11:05.374
- To me, too.
- Me, too.

01:11:05.374 --> 01:11:07.790
(slow music)

01:11:07.790 --> 01:11:12.790
- Speaking your truth is the
most powerful tool we all have.

01:11:16.400 --> 01:11:20.187
The new day is on the horizon!

01:11:20.187 --> 01:11:23.020
(audience cheers)

01:11:23.934 --> 01:11:26.351
(slow music)

01:11:55.120 --> 01:11:58.330
- So, you know, I think that
does, just seeing those images,

01:11:58.330 --> 01:12:00.670
and, for some reason,
you only got the music,

01:12:00.670 --> 01:12:05.600
but not the actual voices,
it just, it reminds us

01:12:05.600 --> 01:12:10.600
of how many incredible
movements have been launched

01:12:12.220 --> 01:12:14.103
since Donald Trump was elected.

01:12:15.650 --> 01:12:19.050
From the, from immigrants protections

01:12:19.050 --> 01:12:23.203
to the women's march,
to the Me, Too moment,

01:12:24.457 --> 01:12:28.926
to the successful struggle
to oppose the repeal

01:12:28.926 --> 01:12:33.090
of Obamacare, even
though Trump had control

01:12:33.090 --> 01:12:38.090
of both houses of Congress,
to the most recent efforts

01:12:38.320 --> 01:12:42.990
of high school students to
respond to mass shootings.

01:12:42.990 --> 01:12:46.460
It's really pretty remarkable, and to me,

01:12:46.460 --> 01:12:48.770
that is where our salvation lies,

01:12:48.770 --> 01:12:52.910
and so I'll close with a
quote from Learned Hand,

01:12:52.910 --> 01:12:55.790
Learned Hand was a judge
on the United States Court

01:12:55.790 --> 01:12:58.090
of Appeals for the Second Circuit,

01:12:58.090 --> 01:13:01.030
he's often said to be
greatest federal judge not

01:13:01.030 --> 01:13:03.540
to have served on the Supreme Court.

01:13:03.540 --> 01:13:05.260
Now that my wife is a federal judge,

01:13:05.260 --> 01:13:09.423
I can't agree with that, but
he was a pretty good judge,

01:13:10.809 --> 01:13:14.130
and he made a speech in 1942 to

01:13:15.090 --> 01:13:20.090
a crowd of 150,000 newly
naturalized citizens,

01:13:21.602 --> 01:13:24.450
and this was a remarkable
naturalization ceremony,

01:13:24.450 --> 01:13:27.510
it was held in Central
Park, 150,000 immigrants

01:13:27.510 --> 01:13:29.890
who had taken the oath to become citizens,

01:13:29.890 --> 01:13:34.270
and they asked Learned Hand
to address these new members

01:13:34.270 --> 01:13:38.110
of our polity, and he
decided to speak about

01:13:39.830 --> 01:13:40.663
liberty.

01:13:41.500 --> 01:13:43.580
And he said

01:13:43.580 --> 01:13:47.937
that, "Liberty lies in the hearts

01:13:47.937 --> 01:13:52.930
"of men and women, when it lies there,"

01:13:52.930 --> 01:13:53.763
or, no.

01:13:53.763 --> 01:13:58.457
"When it dies there, no
court, no constitution,

01:13:58.457 --> 01:14:03.107
"no law can save it,
but when it lies there,

01:14:03.107 --> 01:14:07.037
"it needs no court, no constitution,

01:14:07.037 --> 01:14:09.847
"no law to save it."

01:14:11.330 --> 01:14:14.200
And like many great quotes,
it's an overstatement,

01:14:14.200 --> 01:14:17.930
we need courts, we need a
constitution, we need laws,

01:14:17.930 --> 01:14:21.910
they instantiate our
ideals, and hold us to them

01:14:21.910 --> 01:14:24.760
in moments when we fall short.

01:14:24.760 --> 01:14:28.810
But it recognizes a critical truth,

01:14:28.810 --> 01:14:32.840
and that is that the ultimate protector

01:14:32.840 --> 01:14:34.370
of

01:14:34.370 --> 01:14:36.563
liberty is us,

01:14:37.750 --> 01:14:39.820
and so, to me,

01:14:39.820 --> 01:14:44.400
what is most hopeful about this moment

01:14:44.400 --> 01:14:49.400
is that us, we, have stood
up like never before,

01:14:49.800 --> 01:14:51.220
in my

01:14:51.220 --> 01:14:55.900
lifetime, as a citizen, to come together

01:14:55.900 --> 01:14:59.460
in defense of basic civil
liberties and civil rights.

01:14:59.460 --> 01:15:04.460
And so I'm, I feel privileged
to be part of that battle,

01:15:05.150 --> 01:15:08.740
but I am buoyed by the fact that so many

01:15:08.740 --> 01:15:12.450
of our fellow citizens
are part of that battle,

01:15:12.450 --> 01:15:15.930
and I hope all of you will be part of

01:15:15.930 --> 01:15:18.243
that battle going forward,
thank you very much.

01:15:18.243 --> 01:15:21.243
(audience applauds)

01:15:25.450 --> 01:15:29.890
- Thank you very much for
that wonderful set of remarks.

01:15:29.890 --> 01:15:32.580
If you're willing, could
we take a few questions?

01:15:32.580 --> 01:15:33.413
- Yeah, sure.

01:15:33.413 --> 01:15:35.580
- So I'm gonna put this microphone here,

01:15:35.580 --> 01:15:38.090
anyone who wants to ask a question,

01:15:38.090 --> 01:15:41.650
please come to the microphone,
they can form a little line,

01:15:41.650 --> 01:15:43.860
I only make two requests of you.

01:15:43.860 --> 01:15:47.630
First, please keep your questions short,

01:15:47.630 --> 01:15:51.005
and second, please ask a question.

01:15:51.005 --> 01:15:52.205
(audience laughs)
Okay.

01:15:53.310 --> 01:15:56.070
- And if you do that, I'll
keep my answers short,

01:15:56.070 --> 01:15:57.020
and give an answer.

01:15:59.090 --> 01:16:01.440
- [Man] Thanks for your presentation,

01:16:01.440 --> 01:16:04.560
I'm actually one of
the defendants from the

01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:08.600
2016 Republican National
Convention flag burning case,

01:16:08.600 --> 01:16:10.400
along with Joey Johnson,

01:16:10.400 --> 01:16:13.260
from Texas v. Johnson's
a good friend of mine.

01:16:13.260 --> 01:16:14.850
- Yep, my former client.

01:16:14.850 --> 01:16:16.950
- [Man] So I'm very familiar both

01:16:16.950 --> 01:16:20.980
with the authoritarian attacks
that have been happening,

01:16:20.980 --> 01:16:25.330
but also, our cases were
dropped, and all the ways

01:16:25.330 --> 01:16:28.780
in which the courts
have beaten back, and I,

01:16:28.780 --> 01:16:31.100
beaten back these various attacks on lots

01:16:31.100 --> 01:16:33.290
of different fronts,
and I appreciate the way

01:16:33.290 --> 01:16:35.010
that you talked about the combination

01:16:35.010 --> 01:16:37.723
of civil society activism, along with,

01:16:38.750 --> 01:16:41.740
you know, the legal battles in the courts.

01:16:41.740 --> 01:16:45.880
My question is about the actual dynamic

01:16:45.880 --> 01:16:48.220
that's been happening where, yes,

01:16:48.220 --> 01:16:50.260
things have been beaten
back on various fronts,

01:16:50.260 --> 01:16:53.570
but the Trump regime keeps pushing forward

01:16:53.570 --> 01:16:56.638
on many other fronts,
including finding other ways,

01:16:56.638 --> 01:16:58.720
you know, besides just the Muslim ban,

01:16:58.720 --> 01:17:01.020
whether it's extreme
vetting, or whether it's,

01:17:01.870 --> 01:17:04.060
you know, different, other restrictions,

01:17:04.060 --> 01:17:06.190
and ways to keep people
from those countries.

01:17:06.190 --> 01:17:08.860
And on top of that,
there's the question of,

01:17:08.860 --> 01:17:13.370
you know, using incidents
in the same way you talked

01:17:13.370 --> 01:17:14.960
about in the, the Palmer raids,

01:17:14.960 --> 01:17:17.810
they used those terrorist
bombings, there's, I mean,

01:17:17.810 --> 01:17:20.570
look at what Bush used
9/11 to do, can you imagine

01:17:20.570 --> 01:17:24.070
if there's some incident like that now,

01:17:24.070 --> 01:17:26.510
with this guy in the White House?

01:17:26.510 --> 01:17:31.310
So my question is, I guess I agree with

01:17:33.070 --> 01:17:37.020
the, the hope that you have,
but I also think we have

01:17:37.020 --> 01:17:41.320
to confront how dangerous
the situation is,

01:17:41.320 --> 01:17:46.320
and rather than just fighting
against each separate attack

01:17:46.430 --> 01:17:49.660
on people, don't we need
to actually mobilize all

01:17:49.660 --> 01:17:51.430
those people that were in the airports,

01:17:51.430 --> 01:17:52.850
that were at the women's
march, don't we need

01:17:52.850 --> 01:17:57.470
to mobilize them to drive the
regime from power altogether?

01:17:57.470 --> 01:18:02.470
- So, you know, I think,
yeah, there are many,

01:18:02.860 --> 01:18:04.270
there are many attacks,

01:18:04.270 --> 01:18:09.270
the Trump administration
has gone after many targets,

01:18:09.920 --> 01:18:11.630
and so it's a challenge.

01:18:11.630 --> 01:18:13.320
I mean, you know, we have,

01:18:13.320 --> 01:18:15.500
because we're a multi issue organization,

01:18:15.500 --> 01:18:18.780
we're, we've been able to
respond to many of them,

01:18:18.780 --> 01:18:21.090
but there are plenty
that we can't respond to,

01:18:21.090 --> 01:18:23.030
the environment attacks, the, you know,

01:18:23.030 --> 01:18:26.610
the environment groups are responding to.

01:18:26.610 --> 01:18:29.850
There are a whole host of organizations

01:18:29.850 --> 01:18:31.680
that are fighting back in various ways,

01:18:31.680 --> 01:18:34.390
and I think it takes the
work of all of us to do it.

01:18:34.390 --> 01:18:36.900
In terms of, you know, getting
the regime out of power,

01:18:36.900 --> 01:18:41.160
that's what elections are
for, there will be midterms,

01:18:41.160 --> 01:18:45.060
I think, you know, the, I'm optimistic

01:18:45.060 --> 01:18:46.960
about the midterms, about the possibility

01:18:46.960 --> 01:18:48.987
of people who believe in civil rights

01:18:48.987 --> 01:18:52.260
and civil liberties getting elected,

01:18:52.260 --> 01:18:56.090
and that will put a further
constraint on the president.

01:18:56.090 --> 01:19:00.140
I'm optimistic about
2020, when we get there.

01:19:00.140 --> 01:19:03.923
You know, Donald Trump was elected with,

01:19:06.580 --> 01:19:09.870
losing the popular vote, he
got three million fewer votes

01:19:09.870 --> 01:19:11.810
than Hillary Clinton, he won because

01:19:11.810 --> 01:19:14.670
of the peculiarity of
our electoral college.

01:19:14.670 --> 01:19:17.060
He came into office with
the lowest approval rating

01:19:17.060 --> 01:19:18.950
of any president in history,

01:19:18.950 --> 01:19:21.810
and his approval rating
has fallen since then.

01:19:21.810 --> 01:19:22.643
So,

01:19:23.908 --> 01:19:27.680
in a democracy, that is a significant

01:19:28.540 --> 01:19:29.620
hindrance

01:19:29.620 --> 01:19:32.450
to getting done what you want to get done.

01:19:32.450 --> 01:19:34.100
Most of what he's gotten done is

01:19:34.100 --> 01:19:36.810
through unilateral executive action,

01:19:36.810 --> 01:19:39.490
and the thing about
unilateral executive action is

01:19:39.490 --> 01:19:42.140
that there's quite a bit of room

01:19:42.140 --> 01:19:45.160
for unilateral executive
action, but it can be reversed

01:19:45.160 --> 01:19:49.860
by the next president, if we
elect a president who cares

01:19:49.860 --> 01:19:52.500
about civil rights and civil liberties.

01:19:52.500 --> 01:19:56.870
So I think the response is
through the democratic process,

01:19:56.870 --> 01:20:01.210
and, you know, as to the
risk of a terrorist incident,

01:20:01.210 --> 01:20:03.900
absolutely, that's a concern, but look,

01:20:03.900 --> 01:20:07.723
you know, George Bush had more, more,

01:20:08.764 --> 01:20:11.570
more going for him than President Trump.

01:20:11.570 --> 01:20:16.233
He did not, when 9/11 happened,

01:20:17.140 --> 01:20:20.500
he had a Congress on his side,

01:20:20.500 --> 01:20:21.630
he had the court on his side, in fact,

01:20:21.630 --> 01:20:23.650
it was the court that put him into office

01:20:23.650 --> 01:20:26.073
through Bush versus
Gore, it was his court.

01:20:27.882 --> 01:20:30.780
And he had a history of
deference to the president

01:20:30.780 --> 01:20:34.813
in times of crisis, and he
had 90% approval ratings.

01:20:36.370 --> 01:20:39.580
And yet, by the time, and he acted in,

01:20:39.580 --> 01:20:42.650
he over-responded to the attacks on 9/11,

01:20:42.650 --> 01:20:45.170
and authorized torture,
and disappearances,

01:20:45.170 --> 01:20:49.943
and Guantanamo and the like,
but by the time he left office,

01:20:50.870 --> 01:20:54.820
he had released over 500
people from Guantanamo,

01:20:54.820 --> 01:20:59.820
he had closed down the secret
prisons in eastern Europe,

01:20:59.860 --> 01:21:02.400
he had suspended the torture program,

01:21:02.400 --> 01:21:04.540
he had stopped extraordinary rendition,

01:21:04.540 --> 01:21:06.130
where we abducted people, and sent them

01:21:06.130 --> 01:21:07.670
to other countries to be tortured.

01:21:07.670 --> 01:21:11.660
And he did that in
response to civil society

01:21:14.250 --> 01:21:15.530
advocacy

01:21:15.530 --> 01:21:19.920
that made it too costly for
him to continue those efforts,

01:21:19.920 --> 01:21:23.480
in particular, because foreign
countries were unwilling

01:21:23.480 --> 01:21:28.480
to work with him because
he was so tainted by these,

01:21:28.800 --> 01:21:33.800
these acts, so if we could
push back against George Bush,

01:21:33.960 --> 01:21:35.770
who had 90% approval ratings,

01:21:35.770 --> 01:21:38.240
surely we can push back
against Donald Trump,

01:21:38.240 --> 01:21:40.833
who doesn't, can't even
command a majority, yeah?

01:21:41.740 --> 01:21:44.210
- [Woman] Hello, thank
you for your speech.

01:21:44.210 --> 01:21:47.100
I'm just a local activist
grassroots person,

01:21:47.100 --> 01:21:50.210
I happen to do a lot of work
for Organizing for Action,

01:21:50.210 --> 01:21:54.560
the former Obama group,
which is very issues based,

01:21:54.560 --> 01:21:59.330
and the thing that strikes
me the most is yes,

01:21:59.330 --> 01:22:01.700
I thought the day he was elected,

01:22:01.700 --> 01:22:04.180
that it would incite enough people

01:22:04.180 --> 01:22:06.310
to fight back, but the thing is,

01:22:06.310 --> 01:22:08.500
that he's the great creator of chaos,

01:22:08.500 --> 01:22:11.590
and he has siloed off all the people

01:22:11.590 --> 01:22:15.160
into all the various issues,
so we have, you know,

01:22:15.160 --> 01:22:18.120
he's great at just throwing a
new issue out there every day

01:22:18.120 --> 01:22:21.240
on Twitter, you know, if he
can't get healthcare through,

01:22:21.240 --> 01:22:24.000
he's talking about taking
a knee at the NFL game.

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:27.760
So my question to you is, given the fact

01:22:27.760 --> 01:22:31.850
that his strategy seems to
be to go after grassroots

01:22:31.850 --> 01:22:35.340
by dividing and conquering,
and creating a thousand issues,

01:22:35.340 --> 01:22:38.580
so I'm fighting for DACA
today, and tomorrow,

01:22:38.580 --> 01:22:41.820
you know, you're fighting
for the Muslim ban,

01:22:41.820 --> 01:22:45.910
whatever it is, what can the ACLU do,

01:22:45.910 --> 01:22:48.350
'cause there's strength in
numbers, we're Warriors fans,

01:22:48.350 --> 01:22:53.350
what can the ACLU contribute
to bringing strength

01:22:54.240 --> 01:22:57.550
in numbers, bringing us together,

01:22:57.550 --> 01:23:00.120
because united we stand,
and divided we fall,

01:23:00.120 --> 01:23:03.460
and that's one of his key strategies.

01:23:03.460 --> 01:23:08.354
- So that's a great
question, and, and I think,

01:23:08.354 --> 01:23:10.340
you know, it's the key question,

01:23:10.340 --> 01:23:11.970
and I don't think, at the end of the day,

01:23:11.970 --> 01:23:15.530
it's the ACLU that will do
that, we are trying to do that,

01:23:15.530 --> 01:23:18.870
People Power is especially
trying to do that.

01:23:18.870 --> 01:23:22.810
We work in coalitions
across the board to try

01:23:22.810 --> 01:23:26.670
to foster progressive movements,

01:23:26.670 --> 01:23:27.710
and,

01:23:27.710 --> 01:23:32.710
and strengthen the opposition
to, to these abuses,

01:23:33.700 --> 01:23:35.200
but at the end of the day, you know,

01:23:35.200 --> 01:23:38.070
I think it's got to be
the Democratic party,

01:23:38.070 --> 01:23:41.730
you know, that, which is a
big tent across the board

01:23:41.730 --> 01:23:43.860
of organization, it's not focused, I mean,

01:23:43.860 --> 01:23:46.540
we're broad-based for civil
liberties and civil rights,

01:23:46.540 --> 01:23:47.790
but we don't deal with the environment,

01:23:47.790 --> 01:23:50.510
we don't deal with, you
know, regulation of business,

01:23:50.510 --> 01:23:55.040
particularly, we don't
deal with the distribution

01:23:55.040 --> 01:23:57.240
of wealth, a huge issue
in this country, right?

01:23:57.240 --> 01:23:59.350
So it can't be our organization,

01:23:59.350 --> 01:24:01.860
and there is no, the only organization

01:24:01.860 --> 01:24:03.370
that really is across the board,

01:24:03.370 --> 01:24:06.150
that has the capacity to be a,

01:24:06.150 --> 01:24:10.790
to stand against the president
is the Democratic party,

01:24:10.790 --> 01:24:15.020
I think, and, you know,
I'm not overly impressed

01:24:15.020 --> 01:24:18.827
by the Democratic party's work thus far,

01:24:18.827 --> 01:24:21.890
in standing up, but I
think at the, you know,

01:24:21.890 --> 01:24:25.490
when it comes to the
midterms, you're gonna see all

01:24:25.490 --> 01:24:28.470
of this energy, you know, the
energy that's been directed

01:24:28.470 --> 01:24:32.228
at immigrant's rights, and
towards the Me, Too moment,

01:24:32.228 --> 01:24:34.960
and around gun control.

01:24:34.960 --> 01:24:37.300
All of that energy is gonna come together

01:24:37.300 --> 01:24:40.770
in support of candidates who
care about civil liberties

01:24:40.770 --> 01:24:42.900
and civil rights, they might be Democrat,

01:24:42.900 --> 01:24:46.280
they might be Republican,
but it'll be candidates

01:24:46.280 --> 01:24:49.360
who stand against what
Donald Trump stands for,

01:24:49.360 --> 01:24:51.180
and that's how we come together.

01:24:51.180 --> 01:24:55.820
But I agree, we need, we
need, we need messages

01:24:55.820 --> 01:24:58.997
that unite us, and, you
know, I think civil rights

01:24:58.997 --> 01:25:02.390
and civil liberties is a
message that can unite us,

01:25:02.390 --> 01:25:06.390
because it's ultimately
predicated on a set of rights

01:25:06.390 --> 01:25:11.390
that are owed to all of us
by virtue of our being human.

01:25:12.090 --> 01:25:14.090
They're not the rights of progressives,

01:25:14.090 --> 01:25:16.230
they're not the rights of liberals,

01:25:16.230 --> 01:25:18.660
they're the rights of all of us,

01:25:18.660 --> 01:25:21.620
and so that, and one of the ways

01:25:21.620 --> 01:25:25.990
that we define ourselves as Americans is

01:25:25.990 --> 01:25:28.090
by virtue of the values and rights

01:25:28.090 --> 01:25:29.750
that are reflected in our constitution,

01:25:29.750 --> 01:25:31.360
and the Bill of Rights
is one set of those.

01:25:31.360 --> 01:25:34.210
So I think it can be a unifying force,

01:25:34.210 --> 01:25:36.923
but it can't be the only
unifying force, thanks.

01:25:40.270 --> 01:25:42.830
- [Man] First, thank you
for your wonderful talk.

01:25:42.830 --> 01:25:45.810
You mentioned in your discussion

01:25:45.810 --> 01:25:48.380
of the first amendment
the Brandenburg test,

01:25:48.380 --> 01:25:50.060
which defines the outer bounds of

01:25:50.060 --> 01:25:54.110
what is protected free
speech, and the fact

01:25:54.110 --> 01:25:56.840
that Brandenburg was
a Ku Klux Klan leader.

01:25:56.840 --> 01:25:59.280
I'm gonna go to a meeting,
I'm not a member of the NLG,

01:25:59.280 --> 01:26:01.980
but right after this, about
the new FBI designation

01:26:01.980 --> 01:26:05.550
called Black Identity Extremist,
I wonder if you could speak

01:26:05.550 --> 01:26:10.550
to the notion that the ACLU
should prioritize and continue

01:26:10.760 --> 01:26:14.640
to defend the most really
vicious and virulent

01:26:14.640 --> 01:26:17.440
and offensive hate
speech, as long as it is

01:26:17.440 --> 01:26:20.020
within the bounds of the Brandenburg test,

01:26:20.020 --> 01:26:23.770
so that a deterioration
of the Brandenburg test,

01:26:23.770 --> 01:26:26.350
if it were to happen, could not be used

01:26:26.350 --> 01:26:28.930
against black activists who could then be

01:26:28.930 --> 01:26:30.820
called black identity extremists,

01:26:30.820 --> 01:26:33.940
and accused of fomenting
violence, and all the rest.

01:26:33.940 --> 01:26:36.683
So I think that there's,
it's a lively discussion,

01:26:38.240 --> 01:26:41.300
but I wonder if you could
speak to that discussion,

01:26:41.300 --> 01:26:44.323
and where the ACLU
stands, and in particular,

01:26:45.810 --> 01:26:47.860
well, that's, on that, thank you.

01:26:47.860 --> 01:26:49.500
- So, so, yeah, thank
you for that question,

01:26:49.500 --> 01:26:52.680
you know, the ACLU has long, again,

01:26:52.680 --> 01:26:57.099
we defend the Bill of
Rights, we defend the rights

01:26:57.099 --> 01:26:59.170
that are reflected in the Bill of Rights,

01:26:59.170 --> 01:27:00.940
which are ultimately human rights,

01:27:00.940 --> 01:27:05.730
they are owed to everybody,
and we will defend them

01:27:05.730 --> 01:27:08.800
on behalf of anybody,

01:27:08.800 --> 01:27:12.470
so, so we defend the right to speak

01:27:12.470 --> 01:27:16.270
of civil rights activists,
but we also defend the right

01:27:16.270 --> 01:27:20.240
to speak of white
supremacists, and I think,

01:27:20.240 --> 01:27:23.080
you know, if you are committed
to a principled defense

01:27:23.080 --> 01:27:26.660
of the first amendment,
it can't be any other way.

01:27:26.660 --> 01:27:29.550
The first amendment is not, if
the first amendment was just

01:27:29.550 --> 01:27:32.223
about protecting those
with whom you agree,

01:27:33.210 --> 01:27:35.031
it wouldn't be a human right, right?

01:27:35.031 --> 01:27:38.470
It would be a right of,
of a particular subset

01:27:38.470 --> 01:27:43.470
of the country, so, so I
think a principled stand

01:27:44.350 --> 01:27:47.690
in defense of the first amendment requires

01:27:47.690 --> 01:27:52.540
that one recognize that
the right extends not only

01:27:52.540 --> 01:27:53.790
to the people with whom you agree,

01:27:53.790 --> 01:27:57.220
but the people with whom you disagree.

01:27:57.220 --> 01:28:01.440
And in a democracy, it is ultimately,

01:28:01.440 --> 01:28:03.410
the first amendment is
ultimately a protection

01:28:03.410 --> 01:28:06.130
of the minority, right, it is a protection

01:28:06.130 --> 01:28:09.270
of those who don't have
power in democracy,

01:28:09.270 --> 01:28:11.720
who don't have a majority vote.

01:28:11.720 --> 01:28:13.590
And it's a critically
important protection,

01:28:13.590 --> 01:28:15.700
because it's what, it's what gives those

01:28:15.700 --> 01:28:18.490
of us who are not in power,
those of us who are unhappy

01:28:18.490 --> 01:28:23.340
with the status quo, a
way to voice our concern,

01:28:23.340 --> 01:28:27.230
and to act on our
concern, it is, you know,

01:28:27.230 --> 01:28:30.660
the engine of that resistance

01:28:30.660 --> 01:28:32.960
that I've been celebrating here.

01:28:32.960 --> 01:28:37.831
And if we were to advance a
position that says, actually,

01:28:37.831 --> 01:28:42.100
the first amendment only protects
the speech we like, well,

01:28:42.100 --> 01:28:45.503
who would be deciding
which speech we like?

01:28:46.550 --> 01:28:50.610
It wouldn't be minority groups,
it wouldn't be dissidents,

01:28:50.610 --> 01:28:53.910
it would be the majority,
it would be Donald Trump,

01:28:53.910 --> 01:28:56.760
it would be the mayor of
the town in Mississippi,

01:28:56.760 --> 01:28:59.750
it would be the governor
of Arkansas, right,

01:28:59.750 --> 01:29:02.360
it would be the people who are in power,

01:29:02.360 --> 01:29:05.280
and you can be sure that the speech

01:29:05.280 --> 01:29:10.280
that they would suppress is likely to be

01:29:10.890 --> 01:29:11.723
the kind

01:29:11.723 --> 01:29:16.723
of speech that we want
heard, not the kind of speech

01:29:16.980 --> 01:29:19.010
with which we disagree.

01:29:19.010 --> 01:29:21.940
So I think on grounds of principle,

01:29:21.940 --> 01:29:25.193
and on grounds of democratic practice,

01:29:26.300 --> 01:29:30.283
it's important to protect
speech rights of all.

01:29:31.220 --> 01:29:33.293
On campus, and off.

01:29:34.630 --> 01:29:37.730
- [Man] Again, thank you,
I appreciated your voice

01:29:37.730 --> 01:29:41.010
of optimism of the phoenix
rising from the ashes

01:29:41.010 --> 01:29:45.050
of this past election, and
I hope it comes to pass,

01:29:45.050 --> 01:29:48.620
and I try to think back
to McCarthyism as an era

01:29:48.620 --> 01:29:50.120
that we no longer have to deal with,

01:29:50.120 --> 01:29:53.250
and maybe someday we'll look
back at this era the same way.

01:29:53.250 --> 01:29:56.060
My question concerns one
of the issues you raised,

01:29:56.060 --> 01:29:57.863
you mentioned, in terms
of one of the pillars

01:29:57.863 --> 01:30:00.620
that are protecting us is the media,

01:30:00.620 --> 01:30:02.282
you briefly mentioned it.
- Yeah.

01:30:02.282 --> 01:30:04.720
- [Man] The issue there that concerns me,

01:30:04.720 --> 01:30:06.980
and I'd like your reaction
to, is the whole issue

01:30:06.980 --> 01:30:11.220
of fake news, and the attempt by Trump,

01:30:11.220 --> 01:30:15.970
in particular, and right
wing extremism in general,

01:30:15.970 --> 01:30:19.570
to create an alternate
universe where we begin

01:30:19.570 --> 01:30:22.110
to question whether we can
call anything a fact anymore,

01:30:22.110 --> 01:30:23.520
you know, you read articles about, we live

01:30:23.520 --> 01:30:27.500
in a fact-free society
right now, and so on,

01:30:27.500 --> 01:30:31.630
and how, when you have Fox News,

01:30:31.630 --> 01:30:35.100
that will be promoting
things that seem contrary

01:30:35.100 --> 01:30:38.400
to common sense often,
and a Republican party,

01:30:38.400 --> 01:30:40.490
when you look at poles
where they believe something

01:30:40.490 --> 01:30:42.380
with 85% assurance, where the rest

01:30:42.380 --> 01:30:45.670
of the country is something like 15%,

01:30:45.670 --> 01:30:48.680
and it just seems like,
and the similar issue

01:30:48.680 --> 01:30:53.555
of, of the, of the
interference in social media

01:30:53.555 --> 01:30:56.440
by Russians and so on that could affect,

01:30:56.440 --> 01:30:58.840
you know, you talk
about how you're hopeful

01:30:58.840 --> 01:31:01.690
that the next election will bring change,

01:31:01.690 --> 01:31:04.400
but maybe we won't even
have a fair next election.

01:31:04.400 --> 01:31:06.392
And so I guess my question is can you,

01:31:06.392 --> 01:31:09.030
you know, what is your
reaction to all that?

01:31:09.030 --> 01:31:10.513
- So.

01:31:10.513 --> 01:31:11.346
(audience laughs)

01:31:11.346 --> 01:31:14.251
You guys are insistent on
being pessimistic, huh, so.

01:31:14.251 --> 01:31:15.600
(audience laughs)

01:31:15.600 --> 01:31:18.300
No, that, all, all really good questions,

01:31:18.300 --> 01:31:22.260
and social media is a,
you know, it's really the,

01:31:22.260 --> 01:31:24.933
you know, it's the
democratization of media.

01:31:25.930 --> 01:31:28.040
The fact that anybody, to some degree,

01:31:28.040 --> 01:31:31.410
can now be a media outlet, you know,

01:31:31.410 --> 01:31:33.890
in many ways it's empowering, you know,

01:31:33.890 --> 01:31:36.530
you never would have had
those airport demonstrations

01:31:36.530 --> 01:31:39.120
without social media, it was the only way

01:31:39.120 --> 01:31:41.700
that people spontaneously ran out

01:31:41.700 --> 01:31:46.250
to airports on that weekend
was because of a Twitter storm

01:31:46.250 --> 01:31:51.250
that got people, you know, out there.

01:31:51.310 --> 01:31:54.270
So it's a powerful tool, it's
a powerful tool for good,

01:31:54.270 --> 01:31:59.050
it's a powerful tool for
bad, and it frees up speakers

01:31:59.050 --> 01:32:03.350
to speak without editorial control,

01:32:03.350 --> 01:32:06.140
which creates the possibility of all kinds

01:32:06.140 --> 01:32:10.504
of falsehood and the
like, and that's a cost

01:32:10.504 --> 01:32:13.740
of democracy, and I'm not exactly sure

01:32:13.740 --> 01:32:15.870
what the best way to respond to it is,

01:32:15.870 --> 01:32:20.870
I, you know, I tend to be suspicious about

01:32:21.550 --> 01:32:22.450
suggestions

01:32:22.450 --> 01:32:26.333
that we empower a platform,

01:32:27.260 --> 01:32:30.830
you know, like Facebook,
or Twitter, to decide

01:32:30.830 --> 01:32:35.033
what's fake and what's
true, but it also seems,

01:32:36.869 --> 01:32:38.138
you know, in the same way that we're,

01:32:38.138 --> 01:32:40.770
we don't trust the government
to make the right decision

01:32:40.770 --> 01:32:44.040
about what's false and what's true,

01:32:44.040 --> 01:32:47.470
why would we, you know,
trust Mark Zuckerberg

01:32:47.470 --> 01:32:50.290
to make that determination?

01:32:50.290 --> 01:32:53.810
And so, you know, I tend
to think that the best,

01:32:53.810 --> 01:32:57.180
the best answer is still
to let 1,000 flowers bloom,

01:32:57.180 --> 01:33:02.180
and to hope that truth counters falsehood,

01:33:02.700 --> 01:33:06.930
but it's hard to keep one's faith in that,

01:33:06.930 --> 01:33:10.810
in the wake of the kind of echo chamber

01:33:10.810 --> 01:33:13.480
that we're all part of,
and it's not just Fox News,

01:33:13.480 --> 01:33:15.550
it's, you know, there are
certain things you can't say

01:33:15.550 --> 01:33:18.250
on Fox News, and must be said on Fox News,

01:33:18.250 --> 01:33:21.410
and there are certain things
that you can't say on MSNBC,

01:33:21.410 --> 01:33:24.740
and you must say on
MSNBC, are they are two,

01:33:24.740 --> 01:33:26.800
you know, they are alternate universes,

01:33:26.800 --> 01:33:29.650
and it is deeply troubling that we live

01:33:29.650 --> 01:33:31.580
in these alternate universes.

01:33:31.580 --> 01:33:33.780
I think, you know, the best we can do is

01:33:33.780 --> 01:33:38.780
to encourage cross-fertilization,
to encourage those forms

01:33:39.971 --> 01:33:44.260
of forums in which people
speak to each other,

01:33:44.260 --> 01:33:46.300
in which people are confronted with ideas

01:33:46.300 --> 01:33:48.980
that they disagree with, again,

01:33:48.980 --> 01:33:50.880
one of the reasons I think
the first amendment is

01:33:50.880 --> 01:33:53.860
so important, and tolerating
speech we don't like is

01:33:53.860 --> 01:33:56.750
important is because
that's what, you know,

01:33:56.750 --> 01:34:01.670
creates the exchange, which
our system is predicated on.

01:34:01.670 --> 01:34:06.170
So I don't have the answers
to, you know, how we adjust,

01:34:06.170 --> 01:34:09.010
or whether we adjust
first amendment principles

01:34:09.010 --> 01:34:13.813
to social media, I agree
that it's a challenging,

01:34:14.760 --> 01:34:19.690
it's a very challenging area,
and it's one we have to,

01:34:19.690 --> 01:34:20.523
we have to

01:34:23.340 --> 01:34:24.550
figure out.

01:34:24.550 --> 01:34:28.070
But I also think it's
important to keep in mind

01:34:28.070 --> 01:34:31.990
that as much of a danger
social media creates,

01:34:31.990 --> 01:34:34.965
it also creates a tremendous opportunity

01:34:34.965 --> 01:34:39.830
in giving forums for people
to express themselves

01:34:39.830 --> 01:34:42.510
in ways that just weren't available when,

01:34:42.510 --> 01:34:45.020
you know, The New York Times, CBS, ABC,

01:34:45.020 --> 01:34:48.253
and NBC essentially
controlled the waterfront.

01:34:49.470 --> 01:34:52.480
- [Man] Yeah, just to follow
up on the last questioner,

01:34:52.480 --> 01:34:56.480
do you see a danger in
the whole Russia hysteria,

01:34:56.480 --> 01:34:59.480
where apparently Russia's
behind everything bad

01:34:59.480 --> 01:35:01.260
that ever happens in this country,

01:35:01.260 --> 01:35:04.060
it was behind Bernie Sanders,
it was behind Jill Stein,

01:35:04.060 --> 01:35:09.060
and is also what I see,
even in the wake of

01:35:09.210 --> 01:35:11.670
Parkland, you know, calls for,

01:35:11.670 --> 01:35:13.450
well, there were these
conspiracies being spread

01:35:13.450 --> 01:35:16.790
in social media, so therefore
we gotta crack down on,

01:35:16.790 --> 01:35:19.040
do you see a danger of

01:35:20.750 --> 01:35:23.470
this, what I would call faux-resistance,

01:35:23.470 --> 01:35:26.060
that's all channeled into
worrying about Russia,

01:35:26.060 --> 01:35:28.110
and Russia undermining our democracy,

01:35:28.110 --> 01:35:31.350
being used to suppress dissent, you know,

01:35:31.350 --> 01:35:34.450
in a social, like you said,
you know, in a social media,

01:35:34.450 --> 01:35:38.320
either through the companies themselves,

01:35:38.320 --> 01:35:41.720
or pressure on them to,
you know, to crack down

01:35:41.720 --> 01:35:43.010
on certain types of speech,

01:35:43.010 --> 01:35:46.590
which I think will be
directed against dissenters.

01:35:46.590 --> 01:35:49.070
- So I don't, I mean,
I think the danger is

01:35:49.070 --> 01:35:52.330
that this government is
doing nothing about Russia,

01:35:52.330 --> 01:35:55.640
you know, what we've seen, in
terms of Russia's interference

01:35:55.640 --> 01:35:58.960
in our election, is outrageous,

01:35:58.960 --> 01:36:03.280
and any president who had any,

01:36:03.280 --> 01:36:07.250
you know, legitimate
concern for the future

01:36:07.250 --> 01:36:12.250
of our democracy would respond seriously

01:36:12.420 --> 01:36:14.040
to that, to that attack.

01:36:14.040 --> 01:36:19.040
And instead, we have a
president who is unwilling

01:36:20.010 --> 01:36:21.520
to take that threat seriously,

01:36:21.520 --> 01:36:24.630
so I think it's a threat
we need to take seriously,

01:36:24.630 --> 01:36:28.190
I think it's a, you know,
that one of the dangers

01:36:28.190 --> 01:36:30.980
of social media is that it,
is that it is accessible

01:36:30.980 --> 01:36:33.220
to people far beyond our borders,

01:36:33.220 --> 01:36:36.520
who have no legitimate
voice in our democracy,

01:36:36.520 --> 01:36:40.240
and, and are exercising that voice.

01:36:40.240 --> 01:36:43.130
That problem, I think, we could solve,

01:36:43.130 --> 01:36:45.653
I think, you know, dealing with bots,

01:36:46.510 --> 01:36:50.470
identifying the sources of certain kinds

01:36:50.470 --> 01:36:53.739
of news information,

01:36:53.739 --> 01:36:56.320
and social media

01:36:56.320 --> 01:36:57.950
interventions,

01:36:57.950 --> 01:37:00.894
we could, we could
respond to that, I think.

01:37:00.894 --> 01:37:05.400
But no, I think the problem
is quite the opposite,

01:37:05.400 --> 01:37:07.560
that we're not doing enough to respond

01:37:07.560 --> 01:37:10.090
to that problem, than
that we're doing too much.

01:37:10.090 --> 01:37:12.080
- Thank you, I came in despondent,

01:37:12.080 --> 01:37:14.762
and now maybe I'm a little bit hopeful?

01:37:14.762 --> 01:37:16.420
(audience laughs)

01:37:16.420 --> 01:37:19.700
To give you more hope, we
have refreshments in the back,

01:37:19.700 --> 01:37:23.553
I hope you'll join us
in thanking David Cole.

01:37:23.553 --> 01:37:26.553
(audience applauds)

01:37:28.788 --> 01:37:31.371
(upbeat music)
