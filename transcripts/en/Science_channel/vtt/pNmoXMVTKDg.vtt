00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:11.460
These candy wafers come in eight different flavors, the original roll has a random assortment of 38 pieces

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:15.389
Part of the fun is seeing how many of your favorite flavors you get

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:24.900
This factory makes one flavor at a time the first step is to add food coloring and flavoring to pulverized sugar

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:30.239
This pink color and mint flavoring produces a winter green taste

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:39.569
Corn syrup comes next along with a binding solution of vegetable gums and gelatin dissolved in water

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:42.100
after

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.110
Mixing for about eight minutes the candy dough's consistency is checked

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:50.519
Workers divide the dough into chunks then feed them into a dough sheeter

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:57.989
They're pushed through a slot forming a dough sheet that's 20 inches wide by about an inch thick a

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:02.608
Steady sprinkle of cornstarch prevents the sheet from sticking to the equipment

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:09.179
Rollers compress and stretch the dough forward flattening the sheet to an inch thick

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.150
The next station stamps on the company logo then cuts out the wafers

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.409
The conveyor belt moves the wafers to a multi-level tunnel dryer

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.649
They pass through the dryer 13 times over the course of an hour

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.540
Once out of the dryer the wafers pile up in trays without sticking

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:44.029
Workers stack the trays in a drying room. It's heated and humidified with steam

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:52.190
The candy wafers stay here until their moisture level drops to between 0.75 and 1%

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.079
The factory tests a few samples using a device called a pen a trauma tur

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:05.239
It measures the force required to penetrate the candy wafer to the point of breaking it

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.739
This ensures the candies are the correct consistency

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.299
When the trays come out of the drying room workers send the candies to the packaging line

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.920
The colors are mixed together ensuring every roll of candy has a random assortment of flavors

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:35.859
Workers grabbed about two rolls worth then fill two channels of a feeder that takes them to the wrapping station

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.509
Another worker fills in the gaps ensuring each roll has 38 pieces

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:51.219
The wrapping machine cuts printed translucent paper wrapping and applies a bead of glue to one edge

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:59.679
In a matter of seconds, the Machine lifts the roll into the wrapper seals the edges and twist the ends closed
