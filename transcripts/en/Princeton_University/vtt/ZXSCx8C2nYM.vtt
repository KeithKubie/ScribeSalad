00:00:03.308 --> 00:00:05.774
JILL DOLAN: Princeton Research Day is all
about demonstrating different

00:00:05.774 --> 00:00:09.180
kinds of research,
from performances that happen

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:10.781
at the Lewis Center,

00:00:10.781 --> 00:00:15.229
to poster sessions of research
that takes place in natural science

00:00:15.229 --> 00:00:18.552
or engineering laboratories.
So, we're really eager to get a sense

00:00:18.552 --> 00:00:23.420
of the vast variety of research
that students do on this campus

00:00:23.424 --> 00:00:26.886
in conjunction with faculty
and graduate students and staff.

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:29.441
PABLO DEBENEDETTI: The brainstorming
started about two years ago

00:00:29.441 --> 00:00:33.616
and it pretty soon coalesced
into a cooperation

00:00:33.621 --> 00:00:37.485
between Dean of the College,
Dean of the Graduate School,

00:00:37.485 --> 00:00:41.546
Dean for Research,
the Provost's office.

00:00:41.546 --> 00:00:44.101
So it's been a wonderfully
cooperative endeavor.

00:00:44.101 --> 00:00:47.083
And, what we're really trying
to showcase today

00:00:47.083 --> 00:00:50.679
is a cross-cutting diversity
in many senses.

00:00:50.679 --> 00:00:53.626
First of all, it's quite unique
for an event such as this

00:00:53.626 --> 00:00:57.947
to include undergraduates,
graduate students and postdocs,

00:00:57.952 --> 00:01:00.458
so diversity of ages.

00:01:00.458 --> 00:01:04.366
Diversity of fields --
we have science,

00:01:04.366 --> 00:01:09.392
engineering, social sciences,
arts and humanities.

00:01:09.392 --> 00:01:13.507
So, all the aspects of
University research are represented.

00:01:13.547 --> 00:01:16.593
JILL DOLAN: One of the things
that’s important about this opportunity

00:01:16.594 --> 00:01:19.577
is that it gives students
a chance to understand

00:01:19.577 --> 00:01:22.372
what it means to share
their knowledge publicly.

00:01:22.372 --> 00:01:25.956
What we’ve done to kind of mirror that
here on campus is encourage students

00:01:25.956 --> 00:01:30.374
to take workshops with faculty,
to practice presenting their work,

00:01:30.374 --> 00:01:33.565
to think about the quality of
their writing with people like

00:01:33.565 --> 00:01:35.690
John Weeren from Princeton Writes.

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:40.915
JOHN WEEREN: The workshops are designed
to help undergraduates, graduates,

00:01:40.915 --> 00:01:48.111
postdocs communicate their stories
more effectively, to share their research

00:01:48.111 --> 00:01:53.234
in a way that others can not only grasp
it, but appreciate it.

00:01:53.234 --> 00:01:57.615
RYAN DUKEMAN: I think it's a really good
opportunity to get experience presenting

00:01:57.615 --> 00:02:02.961
academic work in a professional setting,
and having that opportunity is something

00:02:02.961 --> 00:02:04.427
that I’m really looking forward to.

00:02:04.427 --> 00:02:07.937
[PEOPLE TALKING]

00:02:07.937 --> 00:02:11.811
PRESENTER: .... amazing fishery. And
the reason is that --

00:02:11.811 --> 00:02:14.651
This is Asia over here...

00:02:14.651 --> 00:02:17.600
ELISE FREEMAN: I'm a freshman.
I'm listening to these excellent

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.243
science presentations that I have no idea
what they’re about and I'm finding that

00:02:21.244 --> 00:02:25.602
I'm walking away very interested
and very engaged, even though

00:02:25.602 --> 00:02:30.545
I'm not directly involved with the fields
that the research is being done in.

00:02:30.545 --> 00:02:35.270
I think that's the main point of Princeton
Research Day, is to expose the student body

00:02:35.272 --> 00:02:38.219
to all these different kinds of fields
that are completely different from

00:02:38.219 --> 00:02:41.523
what they're doing and walking away
with a sense of the significance

00:02:41.523 --> 00:02:44.289
of the research that
our fellow peers are doing.

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:47.460
DJ RASMUSSEN: It’s very exciting
to be able to produce new knowledge

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:51.408
that would otherwise not exist
had you not performed that research.

00:02:51.411 --> 00:02:54.806
GRANT MURPHY: All scientists are
ambassadors to the general public.

00:02:54.806 --> 00:03:02.400
And, science, depending on who the
audience is, can be really transformative.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.496
And, the more scientists are
able to explain what they do,

00:03:06.496 --> 00:03:10.988
the better that society will be able
to understand and adopt new technologies

00:03:10.988 --> 00:03:12.132
and new techniques.

00:03:12.132 --> 00:03:15.347
JILL DOLAN: Taking the opportunity
at the end of the year to do a major

00:03:15.347 --> 00:03:19.760
public, very visible event
in which students can present that work

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.797
is really very groundbreaking.

00:03:21.797 --> 00:03:47.819
