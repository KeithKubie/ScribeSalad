[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:08.680
SUJATA MUKHERJEE: Just
as my opening salvo,

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:11.650
I want each one of
you to talk about--

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:14.560
what does progress mean
to you in the context

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:17.540
of International Women's Day?

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:18.635
Who wants to start us off?

00:00:18.635 --> 00:00:21.051
ELAHE HIPTOOLA: Let's start
with the only man in the camp.

00:00:21.051 --> 00:00:21.640
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.765
SREEKANT LANKA: You knew
that was coming, Sreekant.

00:00:23.765 --> 00:00:24.910
It's OK.

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:27.440
So progress in the spirit
of-- political progress

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:29.410
in the spirit of
International Women's Day.

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:31.655
As you had pointed
out, the gender parity

00:00:31.655 --> 00:00:32.960
exists a whole lot.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.270
And I'll talk a little bit
from Google perspective

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:39.544
as well because I'm the
only Googler on the panel.

00:00:39.544 --> 00:00:41.210
We've been doing a
lot of work in trying

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:43.580
to understand, what
does gender parity mean

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:45.530
from Google's
employee standpoint,

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:46.790
and where do we see.

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:48.710
And it's not just about gender.

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.590
Globally, we have looked
at minority representation

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:52.550
and how it's starting.

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:54.770
In India, specifically
with gender parity.

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:57.860
We've done a lot of sessions
as a part of the diversity

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:01.910
and inclusion teams in
Hyderabad to understand, one--

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:03.440
what does inclusive
behavior mean,

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.420
and what does equal
opportunity look like?

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.640
And also setting the tone
from our senior leadership

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.540
to ensure that everybody is
actually behind some of these.

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.910
It's not just saying things.

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:19.280
As recently as a few weeks
back, we did a session.

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.430
We called it Happy Days,
which was more about helping

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.280
educate children--
underprivileged children--

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.890
about menstrual health
and how they were not

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.620
necessarily aware of what
are the things that they

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:31.130
need to do.

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.140
And it actually helped
them open their eyes.

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.170
And we could see a marked shift
from the whole day's session

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.970
in terms of how they felt
comfortable talking about it,

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:41.660
discussing it.

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:45.170
And also, data that we had
showed around 30-odd% of kids

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.545
drop out of schools because
of menstrual health issues

00:01:49.545 --> 00:01:50.420
that they might have.

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.960
So what that day
actually kind of hinted

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.330
was there's a lot of work
that we can do, primarily

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:57.510
to help in gender parity.

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:59.820
These are small steps that
keep happening-- not just

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.430
inside Google, but outside.

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:03.860
But overall, a lot
more to be done.

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:04.910
A lot to be done.

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:07.310
As a manager on my
team as well, one

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.110
of the things that
we look at is,

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.540
are we being inclusive
in terms of everybody

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.610
that's there when
openings come up,

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.134
or when people need to be hired?

00:02:15.134 --> 00:02:16.550
How are we making
sure that we are

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.885
looking at a diverse and
inclusive way of hiring

00:02:19.885 --> 00:02:20.870
and retaining talent?

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.370
So those are a few
things that we've

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.810
been doing as we think
about progress for parity.

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.900
Ratna?

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.650
RATNA SHEKAR: I might
be a little radical,

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.810
but I'm not a feminist.

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.500
I want to say progress to me is
seizing the opportunities which

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:38.084
come your way.

00:02:38.084 --> 00:02:39.625
I mean, you can
always say, you know,

00:02:39.625 --> 00:02:41.220
my office didn't
give me a promotion.

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.090
I'm not this.

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.680
But you have to seize
the opportunities.

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.100
We've gone through a tough
life, but where we are

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.820
is because of our push.

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.520
So I think women have to
seize the opportunity.

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.250
So there's no point saying
that I've not been given.

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.440
Nobody is going to
give you anything.

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:59.680
You have to seize it.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:00.620
SUJATA MUKHERJEE: I'm
going to come back to you

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:01.689
for more on that.

00:03:01.689 --> 00:03:02.480
RATNA SHEKAR: Yeah.

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.140
SUJATA MUKHERJEE: Vinita.

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.450
VINITA SURANA: So I
come from a family--

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:12.300
see, my grandmother was wearing
a 8 inch [SPEAKING HINDI]----

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:13.290
a veil.

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.340
To me, sitting in
a boardroom where

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.190
I'm the only female
in the boardroom,

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:20.220
I think that's progress for me.

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.970
And another thing which I
can give a personal example

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.820
is, when I started working--

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:28.920
I come from a
manufacturing background,

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.630
and there wouldn't be female
toilets in our manufacturing

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:34.480
units.

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.280
To today, 60% of our
employment are women.

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.300
Because their loyalty
to the company.

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:41.040
They are great.

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.070
We do solar modules, which
is very close to stitching

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:44.970
and knitting.

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.060
So we've taught the people--

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.460
the women-- who are good
in stitching and knitting

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:54.150
to come and work as factory
workers, wear those uniforms.

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.630
And those kinds of women at
the grassroot level, they feel

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.550
empowered even wearing a uniform
and coming to work every day.

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:02.441
So I think that's
progress for me.

00:04:02.441 --> 00:04:03.482
SUJATA MUKHERJEE: Thanks.

00:04:03.482 --> 00:04:05.260
Elahe.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.410
ELAHE HIPTOOLA: I think
it's a matter of age.

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:08.764
What age factors.

00:04:08.764 --> 00:04:10.680
I wouldn't be a radical
so I'm not a feminist,

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.830
but the point is, I
have never see myself

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:15.311
as a woman with a disadvantage.

00:04:15.311 --> 00:04:16.269
Let me put it this way.

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:17.935
RATNA SHEKAR: Yeah,
that's what I meant.

00:04:17.935 --> 00:04:21.279
ELAHE HIPTOOLA: So the house
I grew up in, my parents--

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:22.320
I have a younger brother.

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.029
And they really did not
differentiate between us.

00:04:26.029 --> 00:04:27.570
And I've heard that
from many people.

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:29.670
I was brought up
exactly like my brother.

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:34.260
But when I say this, I realize
how different it is for me.

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:38.640
Not only was I allowed to stay
as late out as my brother was,

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:41.880
or not only did I learn karate
because he learned karate,

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.855
but he learned kathak
because I learned kathak.

00:04:43.855 --> 00:04:46.440
He was made to learn piano
because I was learning piano.

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.554
It's like, the children
went to piano class.

00:04:48.554 --> 00:04:50.220
The children went to
horse riding class.

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:52.890
So I really didn't think that
these certain things-- my mom

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:54.120
doesn't cook to date.

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.880
I mean, she just does
not know how to cook.

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.700
And I never thought that
was a disadvantage, right?

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.380
So coming from that
thing, I didn't

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:03.840
realize that there were too
different fields one could

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:07.560
straddle, or there were
two different skill sets

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.610
that people had based on gender.

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:13.540
I really didn't think of it
until I stepped into the world.

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:16.860
But because I came with
that much of confidence--

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:18.900
I wouldn't say arrogance--
into this world,

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:22.610
I didn't ever take it as
a personal gender assault.

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:23.510
Everyone does it.

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:25.060
Even many are, you know--

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:26.790
[SPEAKING HINDI], guys.

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:28.470
This is not a good word.

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:30.220
In life, shit happens.

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:32.130
But I didn't look
at it that, so I

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:34.890
don't think I'm
pressing for progress,

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:36.472
only pressing for more money.

00:05:36.472 --> 00:05:38.055
Give me money, I
want to make a movie.

00:05:38.055 --> 00:05:39.450
Give me money, I
want to run Lamakaan.

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:41.080
Give me money, I
want to heal a child.

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:42.180
I'm only asking for money.

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:45.280
So I guess I've been just
pressing for furthering

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:46.230
my agenda in life.

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:47.690
But that's about it.

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:50.730
So I do know if they make good
headlines with these lines,

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:52.857
but this is what really
my life taught me.

00:05:52.857 --> 00:05:54.315
SUJATA MUKHERJEE:
It doesn't matter

00:05:54.315 --> 00:05:55.523
if you make headlines, Elahe.

00:05:55.523 --> 00:05:57.477
You're leading the line for us.

00:05:57.477 --> 00:05:58.560
ELAHE HIPTOOLA: Thank you.

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:01.110
SUJATA MUKHERJEE: But you
know, I did want to follow up.

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:05.070
Some very interesting
themes have already emerged.

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:09.000
I think the fact that we
need to seize opportunities,

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.630
shatter glass ceilings,
and also make sure

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:16.100
that it's not just women.

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:18.750
This is leadership
lessons for everybody.

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:19.710
Right?

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:21.700
But I want to revisit
that theme, right?

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:25.080
So like you mentioned,
Elahe, at home, no one

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:27.870
looked at you differently
than your brother.

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:30.050
And I'm pretty much
like that as well.

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:33.120
But do you take
that is privilege?

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:37.440
And there are women who need
the support to be able to speak

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:39.400
up and shatter glass ceiling?

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:41.050
RATNA SHEKAR: Who's support?

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:42.300
SUJATA MUKHERJEE: Other women.

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:43.307
Their management.

00:06:43.307 --> 00:06:45.390
RATNA SHEKAR: Management
is not going to give you.

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:46.430
I've worked with corporate.

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:48.000
SREEKANT LANKA: It's about
yeah, support needed.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:48.540
Definitely.

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:50.610
And it's maybe coming
from whoever it is.

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:53.810
But sometimes what
we have seen, some

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:58.300
of the data that we have
looked at is, women tend to--

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:00.420
not necessarily
everybody; the power

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:03.860
might be more privileged
than others-- but women tend

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:05.760
to be a little bit more
restrictive in terms

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:07.830
of trying to approach
for newer things,

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:13.200
or trying to be more candid
about saying, OK, I want this.

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:14.954
They expect things
to come to them.

00:07:14.954 --> 00:07:16.370
And in those kinds
of situations--

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:17.245
RATNA SHEKAR: No way.

00:07:17.245 --> 00:07:19.036
SREEKANT LANKA: There's
some people who do.

00:07:19.036 --> 00:07:20.970
I mean, it's not like
it's everybody here.

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:22.450
But there are some
people who have that.

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:24.825
And then how do you make sure
that you are helping those?

00:07:24.825 --> 00:07:27.390
So I don't mean to say
that everybody needs that.

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:30.390
But at least, whenever
there's an opening,

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:34.230
job opening, what data that
I've seen suggests that, OK--

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:37.033
if you have 60%,
50% of the skills

00:07:37.033 --> 00:07:40.080
that are required work for a
particular role, a lot of women

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:42.360
would not apply for
that particular job.

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:42.690
ELAHE HIPTOOLA:
Why wouldn't they?

00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:43.830
RATNA SHEKAR: Why wouldn't they?

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:44.400
SREEKANT LANKA:
Because they don't

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:47.170
feel that they have everything
that's required to do that job.

00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:48.626
RATNA SHEKAR: But I've
noticed, even with men, they're

00:07:48.626 --> 00:07:49.375
a little hesitant.

00:07:49.375 --> 00:07:50.190
I went to a--

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:51.600
SREEKANT LANKA: The
issue is much higher.

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:53.670
RATNA SHEKAR: --talk in the
journalism school, and the boys

00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:54.500
were the quietest.

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:56.760
The girls were like, ma'am
this, and ma'am that.

00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:57.510
What should we do?

00:07:57.510 --> 00:07:58.770
How do we become journalists?

00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:00.570
And in fact, they
were very quiet.

00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:02.770
So I think that men
also need the push.

00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:03.270
No, no, no.

00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:04.201
It's OK.

00:08:04.201 --> 00:08:05.117
We don't want men to--

00:08:05.117 --> 00:08:06.430
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:08.850
So you can't just,
like you said,

00:08:08.850 --> 00:08:11.840
you just can't say this is a
woman thing than a man thing.

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:12.720
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:16.170
SUJATA MUKHERJEE: I think
I totally agree with you.

00:08:16.170 --> 00:08:18.540
It would be great to
hear from you about how

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:20.320
you navigated your careers.

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:24.110
Because I think there is enough
for men and women to learn.

00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:25.690
But to Vinita's
that's point, where

00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:27.440
she said that on the
manufacturing floor

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:29.560
there weren't toilets for women.

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:34.890
So we need to make sure that
the system is set up to support

00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:36.210
folks of both genders, right?

00:08:36.210 --> 00:08:39.299
VINITA SURANA: I'd just like
to add a point to what Sreekant

00:08:39.299 --> 00:08:41.990
said, that I do agree with him.

00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:43.620
A lot of women
think that they need

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:46.990
to be perfect before
applying to a job.

00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:49.530
But I feel that women
need to be brave.

00:08:49.530 --> 00:08:50.890
They don't need to be perfect.

00:08:50.890 --> 00:08:52.020
They need to be more brave.

00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:54.180
They need to have more coverage

00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:55.265
Because I think men--

00:08:55.265 --> 00:08:56.890
it's like the
[SPEAKING HINDI],, right?

00:08:56.890 --> 00:08:58.830
Like, men think they're
better than they are.

00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:01.740
And women-- even though they're
so gorgeous, and beautiful,

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:03.190
and talented--

00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:06.010
they still have this
I'm-not-good-enough feeling.

00:09:06.010 --> 00:09:08.830
So I do resonate
with his thought.

00:09:08.830 --> 00:09:12.760
- But tell me how you all
have navigated your careers.

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:15.750
Because Elahe, Ratna,
several different things.

00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:18.850
Vinita, so many different
things that you're managing.

00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:20.020
Sreekant as well.

00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:21.250
Teaching assignments.

00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:23.330
So tell me, how do you
make these choices?

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:26.164
How do you navigate your career?

00:09:26.164 --> 00:09:27.030
RATNA SHEKAR: Elahe?

00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:28.446
You haven't spoken
in a long time.

00:09:28.446 --> 00:09:30.780
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:34.180
ELAHE HIPTOOLA: So I am
a unique person, really.

00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:36.910
I mean, other than the fact that
it's a good thing to be unique.

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:39.280
The only thing I ever
want to do ever growing up

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:40.780
was to become a lawyer.

00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:42.740
Because in my
formative years, I read

00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:44.920
a really terrible book
called "Rage of Angels"

00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:45.997
by Sidney Sheldon.

00:09:45.997 --> 00:09:47.830
And I was, I think, all
of 12 at that point.

00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:48.640
I don't know why
they were letting

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:49.765
me read such books at home.

00:09:49.765 --> 00:09:50.700
But I read that.

00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:52.870
And Jennifer Parker, the
protagonist of the book,

00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:55.300
made this indelible
impression on my mind.

00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:57.680
There was no way wanted
to be anything else.

00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:59.970
In fact, last week, I was
cleaning the [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:01.940
library, and I
found a book which

00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:04.870
someone had gifted me, saying
"to our Jennifer Parker".

00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:07.480
That's all I ever wanted
to do was to do law.

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:09.250
And I was the most
focused kid in school,

00:10:09.250 --> 00:10:10.708
I think, to know
where I was going.

00:10:10.708 --> 00:10:13.302
There were no SATs, there were
no TOEFLs, there was no GMAT.

00:10:13.302 --> 00:10:15.760
There was none of that, because
I knew where I was heading.

00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:16.710
And I did law.

00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:18.682
And it was damn bad.

00:10:18.682 --> 00:10:19.690
It was boring.

00:10:19.690 --> 00:10:20.495
It was terrible.

00:10:20.495 --> 00:10:22.480
I mean, it was great
to study all of that.

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:24.771
But I remember I used to have
things called moot court,

00:10:24.771 --> 00:10:26.929
where you could be a
lawyer and help people

00:10:26.929 --> 00:10:27.970
who were underprivileged.

00:10:27.970 --> 00:10:31.130
And I got my bottom pinched
on day one in the court.

00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:34.810
That shattered my
entire my existence.

00:10:34.810 --> 00:10:36.460
There I was, wearing
a black coat.

00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:39.460
And I'm being felt up
in Bombay High Court.

00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:40.780
And I'm thinking, really?

00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:43.702
This is really what I
dreamed all my life to be?

00:10:43.702 --> 00:10:45.160
And also, I realized
quickly enough

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:47.320
that to be a lawyer in India--

00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:48.750
or anywhere else
in the world, I'm

00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:51.450
sure-- is that you have to
jump onto a moving wagon.

00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:54.250
If your father was a lawyer, you
came-- it's the same all over.

00:10:54.250 --> 00:10:56.920
This whole thing of nepotism
exists as a society.

00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:59.227
It's nothing to do with
just the film world.

00:10:59.227 --> 00:11:00.310
And I recognized it early.

00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:01.609
But then I'd got into fashion.

00:11:01.609 --> 00:11:04.150
I was working to support myself
in Bombay, because my father,

00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:06.995
though we come from a
reasonably, a I say,

00:11:06.995 --> 00:11:07.940
[SPEAKING HINDI].

00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:09.470
He'd always told
us, I'll support.

00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:11.281
[SPEAKING HINDI]

00:11:11.281 --> 00:11:13.030
We never took him
seriously until I really

00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:13.720
finished my degree.

00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:14.620
And then he said,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:15.950
Do what do you want.

00:11:15.950 --> 00:11:18.010
And I started working
in a designer store.

00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:19.260
And I realized, you know what?

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:20.080
I like fashion.

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:22.760
So I came back to Hyderabad
and set up "Elahe".

00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:25.170
There were no choices, like
I said, other than law.

00:11:25.170 --> 00:11:25.760
RATNA SHEKAR: I
remember that story.

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:26.010
ELAHE HIPTOOLA: Yeah.

00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:27.280
There were no choices.

00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:29.680
At that point,
fashion interested me.

00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:31.180
I came back to [SPEAKING HINDI].

00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:35.295
In those days-- I'm talking
'93 is when I set up "Elahe"--

00:11:35.295 --> 00:11:38.530
our answer to fashion was
"Shefali" in Secunderabad,

00:11:38.530 --> 00:11:40.420
[SPEAKING HINDI]
in Banjara Hills.

00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:43.390
That is exactly how fashionable
we were at that point.

00:11:43.390 --> 00:11:44.840
So I thought if
I get this store,

00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:46.270
and I get all these
designers, I'm

00:11:46.270 --> 00:11:48.160
sure people would like to buy.

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:49.390
And they did.

00:11:49.390 --> 00:11:51.520
And then I got bored
with that, because there

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:52.450
was no competition.

00:11:52.450 --> 00:11:54.996
There was nobody else
opening another store.

00:11:54.996 --> 00:11:56.370
And then Nagesh
came into my life

00:11:56.370 --> 00:11:58.036
because he was making
"Hyderabad Blues".

00:11:58.036 --> 00:12:02.710
And he contacted a bunch of
people who could help him.

00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:05.920
And there was this,
shall I say, group

00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:08.770
I belong to called DCH,
which was Dramatic Circle

00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:10.510
Hyderabad"-- but
really, it should

00:12:10.510 --> 00:12:12.343
have been called "Drunken
Circle Hyderabad",

00:12:12.343 --> 00:12:15.490
because in an entire
year, we put up one play.

00:12:15.490 --> 00:12:18.100
But we met every week and drank
ourselves silly to figure out

00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:19.750
which play we were going to do.

00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:24.040
So it was very invigorating
and extremely good

00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:25.360
group that we had.

00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:27.982
And when he contacted them,
they said [SPEAKING HINDI]..

00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:30.950
That's how I got to meet Nagesh.

00:12:30.950 --> 00:12:32.135
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:32.135 --> 00:12:33.340
[SPEAKING HINDI]

00:12:35.889 --> 00:12:37.180
And "Hyderabad Blues" happened.

00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:41.080
So I'm just really
most lucky-- privileged

00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:43.120
because of the
background I come from.

00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:45.370
My calling fell into my lap.

00:12:45.370 --> 00:12:47.930
Every time-- and genuinely,
films is my calling.

00:12:47.930 --> 00:12:51.070
And I did nothing to
get it but just show up.

00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:52.600
The only thing, like you said--

00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:55.196
I know it sounds very lofty
to say I was brave and all--

00:12:55.196 --> 00:12:56.320
but you took opportunities.

00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:58.020
But you're also
much younger, right?

00:12:58.020 --> 00:13:00.270
You feel you can do so much
more when you are younger.

00:13:00.270 --> 00:13:03.270
[SPEAKING HINDI]
When Nagesh met me,

00:13:03.270 --> 00:13:05.290
I was supposed to do
production with him.

00:13:05.290 --> 00:13:06.490
And then he met me, and
he said, you know what?

00:13:06.490 --> 00:13:08.070
Will you audition for a role?

00:13:08.070 --> 00:13:09.580
And like I said,
[SPEAKING HINDI]..

00:13:10.865 --> 00:13:11.740
I'm like, yeah, sure.

00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:12.130
Why not?

00:13:12.130 --> 00:13:13.463
I auditioned and I got the role.

00:13:13.463 --> 00:13:15.820
So I played the second
lead in "Hyderabad Blues".

00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:17.810
Which-- I had never been
on a film set before.

00:13:17.810 --> 00:13:20.660
Forget auditioning
and stuff like that.

00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:22.600
And then while we
were rehearsing,

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:25.400
I would tell the actor,
[SPEAKING HINDI]..

00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:26.300
So Nagesh saw that.

00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:28.930
And he said, would you like
to be my assistant director?

00:13:28.930 --> 00:13:30.672
And like I keep saying,
he was desperate,

00:13:30.672 --> 00:13:32.630
and I was clueless what
assistant director even

00:13:32.630 --> 00:13:33.240
stood for.

00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:34.073
I'm like yeah, sure.

00:13:34.073 --> 00:13:34.800
No problem.

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:36.050
So that's how I became the AD.

00:13:36.050 --> 00:13:39.289
And God forbid I have
anything else in my life.

00:13:39.289 --> 00:13:40.330
It just fell into my lap.

00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:41.705
So I had more
choices I had made,

00:13:41.705 --> 00:13:44.140
other than just saying yes
to when people ask me stuff.

00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:47.170
So people offering
you, take that chance.

00:13:47.170 --> 00:13:49.270
I have gone all over the
world with that answer.

00:13:49.270 --> 00:13:50.968
But I didn't speak for too long.

00:13:50.968 --> 00:13:51.926
So now we'll come back.

00:13:51.926 --> 00:13:54.103
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:54.602 --> 00:13:56.910
SUJATA MUKHERJEE: Vinita.

00:13:56.910 --> 00:13:59.560
VINITA SURANA: So like I said,
I come from a very conservative

00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:00.070
background.

00:14:00.070 --> 00:14:02.250
I think my parents
ambition for me

00:14:02.250 --> 00:14:06.900
is to be the trophy
daughter, or the trophy wife.

00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:11.510
And ever since I was
a kid, I was a rebel.

00:14:11.510 --> 00:14:12.980
I was like, there's
something off.

00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:15.140
My life just can't
be like, you're

00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:21.500
know, just get married, and
be somebody's showpiece.

00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:25.820
And very early on, I started
working for other people,

00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:28.420
because I come from a
family business background.

00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:32.257
And I thought that if I join my
own business, the first day--

00:14:32.257 --> 00:14:33.840
I don't think I'll
be taken seriously.

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:36.040
I don't think I would
be learning much

00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:41.385
So I went, like Elahe said,
even I've traveled a lot.

00:14:41.385 --> 00:14:43.010
I've been to different
cities because I

00:14:43.010 --> 00:14:45.350
wanted that anonymity.

00:14:45.350 --> 00:14:47.860
I did not want to come
from a background.

00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:49.000
I wanted to learn.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:53.090
And I really understood
what it takes

00:14:53.090 --> 00:14:55.830
to be anonymous in a system.

00:14:55.830 --> 00:14:58.160
And when I came back
to my family business,

00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:00.560
I guess there was more
empathy towards my employees.

00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:04.910
Which I would have never owned
if I started from a cabin.

00:15:04.910 --> 00:15:06.680
Like, my cabin.

00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:10.410
Because I went from a desk
to a senior manager and then

00:15:10.410 --> 00:15:13.580
a cabin, I guess that
empathy factor came in to me

00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:15.650
very early on.

00:15:15.650 --> 00:15:18.530
But after I came back
to my family business,

00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:22.270
we started the
solar company that

00:15:22.270 --> 00:15:24.090
is the cash cow of our group.

00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:26.750
I am very active in it.

00:15:26.750 --> 00:15:28.850
And we've done fairly good.

00:15:28.850 --> 00:15:31.250
Last two years has
been a little tough.

00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:34.830
But we've had our run,
and stuff like that.

00:15:34.830 --> 00:15:38.450
But even then, I always felt
like people would always

00:15:38.450 --> 00:15:42.110
associate me to a
family business group.

00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:45.990
So to your question, how
do you maneuver things--

00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:50.870
It's because out of this
thing that, you know,

00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:52.262
I need to prove it to someone.

00:15:52.262 --> 00:15:53.720
I don't know if
it's to my parents,

00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:56.540
or to society, or to my friends.

00:15:56.540 --> 00:15:58.130
But I need to prove
it to someone,

00:15:58.130 --> 00:16:01.187
that I'm not just privileged.

00:16:01.187 --> 00:16:02.270
I want to do my own thing.

00:16:02.270 --> 00:16:05.030
So I am a startup entrepreneur.

00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:08.480
I've done serial startups.

00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:11.409
I've started mentoring
people right now.

00:16:11.409 --> 00:16:12.950
So when you said
startup, [INAUDIBLE]

00:16:12.950 --> 00:16:15.320
I work very actively with them.

00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:17.280
But that also wasn't
enough for me.

00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:20.560
So another hat that I that
wear is these organizations.

00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:24.024
So today I'm a part of three
very active organizations.

00:16:24.024 --> 00:16:25.940
One is called The
Entrepreneur's Organization.

00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:28.870
It's the world's largest
influential organization.

00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:31.080
I'm on the South Asia Board.

00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:34.750
And FICCI Lady's Organization,
if you would have heard it.

00:16:34.750 --> 00:16:35.450
I'm leading.

00:16:35.450 --> 00:16:37.800
I'm the incoming
chairperson next year.

00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:41.170
And another one--
it's very regional.

00:16:41.170 --> 00:16:43.040
Jain International
Trade Organization.

00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:45.210
It's from the
community I come from.

00:16:45.210 --> 00:16:49.010
So all this, when a person
sees my Facebook profile

00:16:49.010 --> 00:16:50.890
like my immediate
community or my friends,

00:16:50.890 --> 00:16:53.020
they're like, oh, you're
doing so many things.

00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:55.932
But it's actually because--

00:16:55.932 --> 00:16:57.140
there are many factors to it.

00:16:57.140 --> 00:16:59.150
One-- because you
are, jobless clueless.

00:16:59.150 --> 00:17:01.820
You want to prove
it to everyone.

00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:07.560
And two-- because you
don't want to be tagged,

00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:11.163
or you don't want
to be known that OK,

00:17:11.163 --> 00:17:12.579
you were born with
a silver spoon.

00:17:12.579 --> 00:17:13.079
No.

00:17:13.079 --> 00:17:14.970
I have my own identity.

00:17:14.970 --> 00:17:20.520
And I think women tend to
try and prove extra for this.

00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:22.020
Like, my brother
is just in Bahamas.

00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:24.012
He's enjoying his gains.

00:17:24.012 --> 00:17:25.720
SREEKANT LANKA: He
doesn't have to prove.

00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:28.053
VINITA SURANA: Yeah, he doesn't
have to prove that much.

00:17:28.053 --> 00:17:32.480
And I think even as an
heir, he would be getting--

00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:38.570
the next generation-- in terms
of the monetary compensation

00:17:38.570 --> 00:17:41.720
and stuff like that, it's
kind of taken for granted

00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:44.030
that it's going to
the men in the family.

00:17:44.030 --> 00:17:47.240
And sure, I do agree to your
point that times are changing,

00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:53.150
and there is going to be
a lot of equality in this.

00:17:53.150 --> 00:17:58.510
But as of now, I still
feel like, as India,

00:17:58.510 --> 00:17:59.819
we are a patriarchal society.

00:17:59.819 --> 00:18:00.860
ELAHE HIPTOOLA: Oh, yeah.

00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:03.540
There's no doubt about that.

00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:04.540
SUJATA MUKHERJEE: Rehka.

00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:05.520
RATNA SHEKAR: Yeah.

00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:08.060
I come from a family
of bankers, and people

00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:09.740
who were in the government.

00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:11.050
But I used to sit and read.

00:18:11.050 --> 00:18:13.920
I was not a person who
would talk like this.

00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:17.070
I was a very quiet,
nice, sweet girl.

00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:17.610
And--

00:18:17.610 --> 00:18:18.612
ELAHE HIPTOOLA:
That, you still are.

00:18:18.612 --> 00:18:19.111
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:19.111 --> 00:18:20.350
RATNA SHEKAR: Thank you.

00:18:20.350 --> 00:18:22.500
And I always wanted
to be a writer.

00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:24.810
Those days, there was
no career counseling.

00:18:24.810 --> 00:18:26.510
Nobody told us, you
must do this course.

00:18:26.510 --> 00:18:28.650
So I just did
English literature.

00:18:28.650 --> 00:18:31.040
And then I went on to--
we moved to Calcutta.

00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:33.670
So there, I joined "Sunday".

00:18:33.670 --> 00:18:37.850
It's not like-- I actually
didn't do a journalism course.

00:18:37.850 --> 00:18:41.110
And then even in college,
I remember my dad writing

00:18:41.110 --> 00:18:42.139
in St. Francis.

00:18:42.139 --> 00:18:43.180
We had to give an option.

00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:43.890
He put Economics.

00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:46.440
And I went there, and cut it
out in front of the sister,

00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:47.490
and put English.

00:18:47.490 --> 00:18:51.280
So my dad said, what are you
going to do with English?

00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:54.120
[SPEAKING HINDI] She'll become a
professor, which I hate though.

00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:55.850
I would never
become a professor.

00:18:55.850 --> 00:18:58.830
So I had no idea how I was
going to become a writer.

00:18:58.830 --> 00:19:02.350
But I just used to loved writing
essays, love writing stories.

00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:05.730
And what happened--
I joined in Calcutta,

00:19:05.730 --> 00:19:07.230
this magazine called
"Sunday", which

00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:09.400
was very iconic in those days.

00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:12.270
And then I think from
there, it took off.

00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:15.189
And when I started,
I didn't say that I

00:19:15.189 --> 00:19:16.230
want to become an editor.

00:19:16.230 --> 00:19:17.340
I want to start magazine.

00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:17.940
Nothing.

00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:20.580
It's just the love of
writing, which I still love.

00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:23.736
So it's just that one love,
it just takes you forward.

00:19:23.736 --> 00:19:25.136
SUJATA MUKHERJEE: Sreekant.

00:19:25.136 --> 00:19:27.510
SREEKANT LANKA: been asked
this question a couple of time

00:19:27.510 --> 00:19:27.850
before.

00:19:27.850 --> 00:19:29.933
The way I think about it--
it's optionality better

00:19:29.933 --> 00:19:30.872
than linearity.

00:19:30.872 --> 00:19:32.580
In the sense like not
necessarily looking

00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:35.280
at your career or life
as a linear progression,

00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:38.460
but more as taking
options and taking risks.

00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:41.430
I come from a middle
class family with parents

00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:42.360
being at the mission.

00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:46.230
So a Telugu guy,
growing up, a career

00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:47.390
it was already set for you.

00:19:47.390 --> 00:19:48.480
You had to be an engineer.

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:49.300
ELAHE HIPTOOLA: Or a doctor.

00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:50.620
SREEKANT LANKA: Or a doctor.

00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:53.130
I was not as smart, so I
chose the engineering route.

00:19:53.130 --> 00:19:54.750
And then it was, go to the US.

00:19:54.750 --> 00:19:55.950
Because that's what you do.

00:19:55.950 --> 00:19:58.860
So you take a GRE, and
I landed up in the US.

00:19:58.860 --> 00:20:00.217
Study there, work there.

00:20:00.217 --> 00:20:01.800
Then I realized that
there are options

00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:03.600
that I can think of
what I want to do,

00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:05.340
and what I don't want to do.

00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:07.860
One of those was teaching.

00:20:07.860 --> 00:20:11.310
I realized that,
back with my parents,

00:20:11.310 --> 00:20:14.330
something stuck to me
about the gene of teaching.

00:20:14.330 --> 00:20:18.360
so that kind of was things
that I have been doing of late.

00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:20.540
And then at some
point I was like, OK.

00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:21.040
Good.

00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:21.810
Done technology.

00:20:21.810 --> 00:20:22.710
Done software.

00:20:22.710 --> 00:20:25.450
I want to do something else.

00:20:25.450 --> 00:20:27.750
I actually hit a glass
ceiling with my colleagues.

00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:30.340
And I figured that I need to
get a business school today.

00:20:30.340 --> 00:20:32.706
So I went to Paris
and got an MBA.

00:20:32.706 --> 00:20:33.330
Then came back.

00:20:33.330 --> 00:20:35.010
Did strategy for some time.

00:20:35.010 --> 00:20:36.310
And then got bored of it.

00:20:36.310 --> 00:20:37.920
Then joined Google.

00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:40.110
I've been with Google
for 7, 8 years.

00:20:40.110 --> 00:20:42.850
And if I look at my career
path, what I realize is,

00:20:42.850 --> 00:20:49.680
there are two things which
kind of are two "not's" for me.

00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:51.240
One-- am I learning?

00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:54.900
And two, am I driving
impact, or adding impact?

00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:57.210
If I'm not learning, or if
I'm not making an impact,

00:20:57.210 --> 00:20:59.440
I kind of get bored and I
want to do something else.

00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:01.890
So usually it's not like
you would continue to learn

00:21:01.890 --> 00:21:03.195
and you would have impact.

00:21:03.195 --> 00:21:05.260
Those don't happen
at the same time.

00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:08.010
But either you're learning
or you are making an impact.

00:21:08.010 --> 00:21:09.780
So either of those
two are things

00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:12.910
that I hold to myself,
as I think about career,

00:21:12.910 --> 00:21:14.510
and progression,
and stuff like that.

00:21:14.510 --> 00:21:16.260
SUJATA MUKHERJEE: So
it's very interesting

00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:19.530
that almost all of you said
that when you started out,

00:21:19.530 --> 00:21:22.590
you weren't sure what
you wanted to do.

00:21:22.590 --> 00:21:25.170
And what I've sort of been
scribbling as you are talking--

00:21:25.170 --> 00:21:26.580
I think that there are
certain things that

00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:28.920
have stood out which I think
is important for everybody

00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:29.890
in this room.

00:21:29.890 --> 00:21:31.660
So like Elahe said-- show up.

00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:32.190
Right?

00:21:32.190 --> 00:21:33.750
When the opportunity
arrives, you

00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:36.850
have to be present
and ready to grab it.

00:21:36.850 --> 00:21:39.760
And also-- be very clear
about what you want.

00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:43.010
So I think for Vinita, it was
a desire to prove yourself.

00:21:43.010 --> 00:21:45.510
For Reha, it was you
know you wanted to write.

00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:49.140
And for you, it was learning
and challenging yourself.

00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:51.840
But let's talk about
the need for support

00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:55.410
and allies and mentors as you
are navigating your careers.

00:21:55.410 --> 00:21:57.900
So could you share
a little bit about--

00:21:57.900 --> 00:22:00.090
you mentioned a little
bit about Nagesh

00:22:00.090 --> 00:22:02.240
and your drunken
circle of Hyderabad.

00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:05.310
But who are the
people who you think

00:22:05.310 --> 00:22:08.640
were able to support you as
you made some of these choices?

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:11.510
In some cases, radical choices?

00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:13.650
Who stood by your side,
and how important do you

00:22:13.650 --> 00:22:15.114
think it is to have a mentor?

00:22:15.114 --> 00:22:17.280
ELAHE HIPTOOLA: I don't
know whether people actively

00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:18.370
seek mentors.

00:22:18.370 --> 00:22:20.160
RATNA SHEKAR: Yeah, that's what
I am a little unclear about.

00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:20.470
ELAHE HIPTOOLA: I'm
sure it happens.

00:22:20.470 --> 00:22:21.262
It is very organic.

00:22:21.262 --> 00:22:22.719
Because then
suddenly, you realize,

00:22:22.719 --> 00:22:24.960
I have learned so much from
this person, or whatever.

00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:26.340
For me, the support--

00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:30.169
which was unconditional,
and it didn't even

00:22:30.169 --> 00:22:32.460
cross my mind that they would
not support-- was family.

00:22:32.460 --> 00:22:34.530
At any point of time, my parents
would have put their foot down

00:22:34.530 --> 00:22:35.456
and said, yes.

00:22:35.456 --> 00:22:36.330
You wanted to do law.

00:22:36.330 --> 00:22:37.047
That was fine.

00:22:37.047 --> 00:22:38.130
Then you got into fashion.

00:22:38.130 --> 00:22:39.174
We kept quiet.

00:22:39.174 --> 00:22:39.840
You got married.

00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:40.690
We allowed you.

00:22:40.690 --> 00:22:41.557
You got divorced.

00:22:41.557 --> 00:22:42.140
You came back.

00:22:42.140 --> 00:22:42.791
We let you.

00:22:42.791 --> 00:22:44.040
Now you want to go into films?

00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:45.530
Absolutely not.

00:22:45.530 --> 00:22:47.790
I remember when we were
doing "Hyderabad Blues".

00:22:47.790 --> 00:22:48.930
And I said, this
guy has come, and he

00:22:48.930 --> 00:22:51.180
wants to make this movie,
and he wants to do all this.

00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:51.990
They were like, OK.

00:22:51.990 --> 00:22:54.115
Another thing-- it was an
18 day stint or whatever.

00:22:54.115 --> 00:22:59.700
So I left my store in the
this thing of my cousin,

00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:01.330
and I went off to shoot.

00:23:01.330 --> 00:23:02.807
And at one morning,
5 AM call time,

00:23:02.807 --> 00:23:05.140
I open my bathroom to get up,
and there's my grandmother

00:23:05.140 --> 00:23:06.120
standing over there.

00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:06.660
And I'm like, [SPEAKING HINDI].

00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:08.720
And she's saying,
it's an English movie.

00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:09.980
So I'm like, yeah.

00:23:09.980 --> 00:23:10.530
No, no, no.

00:23:10.530 --> 00:23:13.220
They kiss.

00:23:13.220 --> 00:23:15.142
So the only person who
panicked in the family

00:23:15.142 --> 00:23:17.100
was my grandmother when
she found out on day 12

00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:18.840
that I was doing
an English film.

00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:21.150
Until then, they were like,
somewhere, this is going.

00:23:21.150 --> 00:23:23.160
So I suppose that
kind of freedom

00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:25.080
could be support in a way.

00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:27.160
We weren't curbed at any point.

00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:28.380
We made lots of mistakes.

00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:30.900
I mean, my journey's
filled with mistakes.

00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:33.910
From my obsession to do law,
to the man I chose to marry,

00:23:33.910 --> 00:23:36.765
to the fact that I gave up my
store when it was at the height

00:23:36.765 --> 00:23:37.680
of it's.

00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:39.160
"Elahe" was the only store.

00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:40.530
Luckily, it's still continuing.

00:23:40.530 --> 00:23:42.071
But the thing is,
I sold my name.

00:23:42.071 --> 00:23:44.070
And whenever I pass by,
I'm like, that's my name

00:23:44.070 --> 00:23:45.254
I. I want it back.

00:23:45.254 --> 00:23:46.920
But that's the only
thing I had to sell.

00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:49.410
The store was on rent and the
clothes were on consignment.

00:23:49.410 --> 00:23:51.300
I couldn't sell anything
else but the name.

00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:54.690
But you never thought
of them as mistakes.

00:23:54.690 --> 00:23:56.940
And then of course,
Nagesh came as a director.

00:23:56.940 --> 00:23:58.950
And he was so clear about what--

00:23:58.950 --> 00:24:01.230
I never met someone
with such clarity.

00:24:01.230 --> 00:24:04.880
He was an unhappy engineer,
because he was a Telugu.

00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:07.760
And he was in America
because he was a Telugu.

00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:10.590
And then, of course, past that,
he just wanted to make movies.

00:24:10.590 --> 00:24:12.660
And he was very
clear about his path.

00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:14.522
And that was such
a novelty to me,

00:24:14.522 --> 00:24:16.230
that someone knew what
they wanted to do.

00:24:16.230 --> 00:24:19.490
Because I really had no
idea what I want to do--

00:24:19.490 --> 00:24:22.230
in present continuous,
not past tense.

00:24:22.230 --> 00:24:24.706
And then as a mentor,
you realize in hindsight

00:24:24.706 --> 00:24:26.580
how much you've picked
up from the people who

00:24:26.580 --> 00:24:27.650
were there in your life.

00:24:27.650 --> 00:24:29.070
So like my father, for instance.

00:24:29.070 --> 00:24:30.660
Extremely checkered career.

00:24:30.660 --> 00:24:32.040
Chartered accountant.

00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:33.340
Became a fashion designer.

00:24:33.340 --> 00:24:35.170
He's responsible for
Rajish Khanna's guru

00:24:35.170 --> 00:24:38.641
collar, and Rajenda Kumar's
saffron pants, colored pants.

00:24:38.641 --> 00:24:40.890
That was my father, because
he was doodling in Bombay,

00:24:40.890 --> 00:24:45.605
and then joined Ratna Shah's
father, Baldev Pathak,

00:24:45.605 --> 00:24:47.040
and they started
this whole thing.

00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:48.680
Then he came to
Hyderabad and set up

00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:51.150
saccharin industries,
and a fire extinguisher

00:24:51.150 --> 00:24:53.130
industry in Patencheru.

00:24:53.130 --> 00:24:56.090
And while he was
doodling, he designed

00:24:56.090 --> 00:24:58.120
the small little
ceasefire unit that

00:24:58.120 --> 00:25:00.090
was so popular at one time.

00:25:00.090 --> 00:25:02.130
And he sold that
design to the people

00:25:02.130 --> 00:25:04.357
who made ceasefire
and retired at 40.

00:25:04.357 --> 00:25:05.940
And it was really
embarrassing for us,

00:25:05.940 --> 00:25:07.290
because we are still in school.

00:25:07.290 --> 00:25:08.595
And people would say,
what does your father do?

00:25:08.595 --> 00:25:09.310
He's an engineer.

00:25:09.310 --> 00:25:09.780
He's a doctor.

00:25:09.780 --> 00:25:10.280
He's a builder.

00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:11.205
What does your father do?

00:25:11.205 --> 00:25:11.705
Nothing.

00:25:11.705 --> 00:25:12.750
He's sitting at home.

00:25:12.750 --> 00:25:14.020
So it was really
embarrassing for us

00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:15.103
to have fathers like that.

00:25:15.103 --> 00:25:17.060
But the point is that was Dada.

00:25:17.060 --> 00:25:18.120
Than I had Nagesh.

00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:21.165
I remember there was a line in
the second film of ours called

00:25:21.165 --> 00:25:22.380
"Rockford" that said--

00:25:22.380 --> 00:25:23.620
don't recognize failure.

00:25:23.620 --> 00:25:25.379
Then there is no failing.

00:25:25.379 --> 00:25:26.920
And I realize that
that is the mantra

00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:29.570
that I've used all my life.

00:25:29.570 --> 00:25:31.110
That if you don't
recognize failure,

00:25:31.110 --> 00:25:32.830
then you really don't
know you've failed.

00:25:32.830 --> 00:25:33.330
Right?

00:25:33.330 --> 00:25:36.960
So I suppose that became a
mentor-mentee relationship.

00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:37.856
But we are not.

00:25:37.856 --> 00:25:39.480
We're a director-producer
relationship.

00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:43.750
So like I said,
mentor, I don't know.

00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:45.930
I just take whatever I
can learn from people,

00:25:45.930 --> 00:25:48.600
and then apply it to
my life, and pretend

00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:50.220
I was the one who spotted that.

00:25:50.220 --> 00:25:52.540
But that's it Yeah.

00:25:52.540 --> 00:25:53.790
SUJATA MUKHERJEE: What about--

00:25:53.790 --> 00:25:55.775
ELAHE HIPTOOLA: Am I answering
any question you are asking?

00:25:55.775 --> 00:25:56.691
SUJATA MUKHERJEE: Yes.

00:25:56.691 --> 00:25:59.470
[LAUGHTER] Until the end of
it, I really don't know what

00:25:59.470 --> 00:25:59.975
I have said.

00:25:59.975 --> 00:26:02.266
RATNA SHEKAR: Elahe, being
entertaining in the bargain.

00:26:04.300 --> 00:26:05.680
I'd like to-- sorry.

00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:07.410
I'd like to acknowledge
my parents, too.

00:26:07.410 --> 00:26:10.410
Because even I was thinking,
who the hell supported me,

00:26:10.410 --> 00:26:11.610
and who are my mentors?

00:26:11.610 --> 00:26:13.800
This unconditional
support from the parents

00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:15.412
is very, very important.

00:26:15.412 --> 00:26:17.370
But of course, I thought
I won't amount to much

00:26:17.370 --> 00:26:18.619
because of English Literature.

00:26:18.619 --> 00:26:22.000
My brothers were all into
MBA and brilliant in math.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:25.910
I was really bad in
math But, like she said,

00:26:25.910 --> 00:26:27.820
they supported whatever I did.

00:26:27.820 --> 00:26:29.120
And when I became a writer--

00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:30.750
I've had a career
in society, and lots

00:26:30.750 --> 00:26:33.510
of magazines in Bombay--
they were extremely proud

00:26:33.510 --> 00:26:34.617
of the whole thing.

00:26:34.617 --> 00:26:37.200
And then, of course, I'd like
to acknowledge Dr. [INAUDIBLE],,

00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:39.090
because I started a
magazine for them.

00:26:39.090 --> 00:26:41.635
So initially whenever
the magazine came out,

00:26:41.635 --> 00:26:44.260
he would say, my god, Ratna, it
looks like National Geographic.

00:26:44.260 --> 00:26:46.220
Because no where--

00:26:46.220 --> 00:26:47.520
And after that, he stopped.

00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:49.750
After first two years he
was calling me regularly.

00:26:49.750 --> 00:26:51.125
We are better than
"India Today".

00:26:51.125 --> 00:26:52.800
You know, he was so proud.

00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:53.810
And then he stopped.

00:26:53.810 --> 00:26:56.210
He knew that I could
stand on my feet.

00:26:56.210 --> 00:26:57.460
I've always acknowledged this.

00:26:57.460 --> 00:26:58.390
SUJATA MUKHERJEE: The
encouragement helped.

00:26:58.390 --> 00:26:58.610
RATNA SHEKAR: Yeah.

00:26:58.610 --> 00:26:59.670
That little word.

00:26:59.670 --> 00:27:00.540
Just a call.

00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:01.320
That's all.

00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:02.885
That's the kind
of mentor he was.

00:27:02.885 --> 00:27:04.260
VINITA SURANA: I
think mentorship

00:27:04.260 --> 00:27:08.040
is the most important
thing in life.

00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:10.800
I felt the lack
of it growing up.

00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:15.170
And I would really feel like
somebody starving in a desert.

00:27:15.170 --> 00:27:19.320
So And I had read this somewhere
that if you don't get something

00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:22.170
in life, you become
the pioneer of it.

00:27:22.170 --> 00:27:23.910
And that's why I feel like--

00:27:23.910 --> 00:27:28.490
right now, one of my part time
careers is also life coaching.

00:27:28.490 --> 00:27:30.760
And I do that for people.

00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:35.550
And I feel that I got into this
because I felt the lack of it.

00:27:35.550 --> 00:27:40.230
But I also believe
every level of your life

00:27:40.230 --> 00:27:41.510
demands a certain mentor.

00:27:41.510 --> 00:27:43.500
A certain skill set.

00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:46.320
A certain advice that
you're looking for.

00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:48.090
And it's a little
bit bit airy-fairy,

00:27:48.090 --> 00:27:50.390
but I do believe in
the law of attraction.

00:27:50.390 --> 00:27:54.690
And I feel like the more you up
your game, the better mentors,

00:27:54.690 --> 00:27:56.910
the better people
come into your life.

00:27:56.910 --> 00:28:00.120
And nothing defies
the grace of a guru.

00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:03.040
If you have a mentor
with the project,

00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:06.087
the relationship, anything.

00:28:06.087 --> 00:28:08.420
Now if i just take it in terms
of a project, the project

00:28:08.420 --> 00:28:11.400
that I can do in a year,
or my personal growth that

00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:13.057
can happen in a year--

00:28:13.057 --> 00:28:14.640
just with the grave
of a guru, I think

00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:18.540
it can accelerate to in a month.

00:28:18.540 --> 00:28:25.350
So I am a total believer of
the mentor-mentee relationship,

00:28:25.350 --> 00:28:25.850
I think.

00:28:25.850 --> 00:28:27.390
I'm pro mentorship.

00:28:27.390 --> 00:28:29.586
RATNA SHEKAR: It's
too late for us now.

00:28:29.586 --> 00:28:30.400
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:32.167
VINITA SURANA: Now
you become mentors.

00:28:32.167 --> 00:28:33.042
RATNA SHEKAR: We are.

00:28:33.042 --> 00:28:34.455
Which is, why am
I still enjoying

00:28:34.455 --> 00:28:36.410
[INAUDIBLE] everything.

00:28:36.410 --> 00:28:39.350
SREEKANT LANKA: From a support
perspective, definitely family.

00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:41.340
Parents were always there.

00:28:41.340 --> 00:28:43.750
And the other equally
important, or more important

00:28:43.750 --> 00:28:46.340
in shaping my career
has been my wife.

00:28:46.340 --> 00:28:48.090
I've shared this with
some of the Googlers

00:28:48.090 --> 00:28:50.710
as well in the past.

00:28:50.710 --> 00:28:56.520
I left my wife and
four-week-old son in the US

00:28:56.520 --> 00:28:58.610
to go to business school
in Paris all by myself.

00:28:58.610 --> 00:29:01.920
And she was there by herself
taking care of the baby.

00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:04.430
A lot of people were like,
you are a great negotiator.

00:29:04.430 --> 00:29:07.500
But it's, more importantly,
she was empathic towards what

00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:09.280
I felt was important for me.

00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:10.380
And then she was there.

00:29:10.380 --> 00:29:12.690
And second thing-- when
I started at Google--

00:29:12.690 --> 00:29:14.640
we were in New York as well--

00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:17.020
we had our second child.

00:29:17.020 --> 00:29:17.850
Our daughter.

00:29:17.850 --> 00:29:20.910
And then, my wife was
there with both of them.

00:29:20.910 --> 00:29:24.300
And then I moved to Europe
to start my career in Google.

00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:27.180
And the same thing happened.

00:29:27.180 --> 00:29:29.850
Now both of those
situations were

00:29:29.850 --> 00:29:32.650
where she stood behind me and
said, hey, you want to do this?

00:29:32.650 --> 00:29:34.930
Go ahead and do it.

00:29:34.930 --> 00:29:37.290
My colleagues and my
bosses make fun of me

00:29:37.290 --> 00:29:39.750
when they moved back
from the US to India.

00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:41.600
They were like, are
you moving to India?

00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:43.140
Now are you expecting
a third one?

00:29:43.140 --> 00:29:44.670
Is that why you're
moving to India?

00:29:44.670 --> 00:29:45.836
It was not necessarily true.

00:29:45.836 --> 00:29:46.450
But, yes.

00:29:46.450 --> 00:29:47.970
She has been there continuously.

00:29:47.970 --> 00:29:51.060
In terms of
mentorship, it happens.

00:29:51.060 --> 00:29:53.430
It's not like you will
find the right mentor.

00:29:53.430 --> 00:29:56.950
Having said that, there are some
things that you can structure.

00:29:56.950 --> 00:30:01.050
One is what attributes or
skills that you don't have

00:30:01.050 --> 00:30:02.370
that you might want to learn?

00:30:02.370 --> 00:30:05.130
What are things that you might
want to learn from somebody?

00:30:05.130 --> 00:30:06.717
It's not something
like, OK, I'm going

00:30:06.717 --> 00:30:09.050
to hook this clip to and say,
this is what I want to do.

00:30:09.050 --> 00:30:10.500
Hence, I'm going
to find somebody.

00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:13.760
But the idea of continuous
learning-- either from a guru,

00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:15.450
or from a coach
or somebody who is

00:30:15.450 --> 00:30:18.450
there who can help you navigate
that next step-- is important.

00:30:18.450 --> 00:30:20.020
You can find them
in various forms.

00:30:20.020 --> 00:30:22.020
And then you need to
continuously look for them.

00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:25.590
The value of a good mentor--
this is understated.

00:30:25.590 --> 00:30:27.529
it's a huge, huge benefit.

00:30:27.529 --> 00:30:29.070
Because they can be
a sounding board.

00:30:29.070 --> 00:30:31.615
Things that you cannot
talk to your colleagues,

00:30:31.615 --> 00:30:34.020
can't talk to your bosses,
because they might hold it

00:30:34.020 --> 00:30:35.900
against you and all of that--

00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:39.502
these mentors actually help
you get the right idea.

00:30:39.502 --> 00:30:41.460
SUJATA MUKHERJEE: We do
a lot of user research,

00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:42.690
and we talk to women.

00:30:42.690 --> 00:30:44.970
And they've said
that the reason why

00:30:44.970 --> 00:30:49.020
I can't pursue a career in
technology, and pursue a PhD,

00:30:49.020 --> 00:30:52.280
and things like that, is because
I can't tell my mom that I want

00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:53.490
to be like Sheryl Sandberg.

00:30:53.490 --> 00:30:53.990
Right?

00:30:53.990 --> 00:30:55.730
Because she's this
foreigner, and it's

00:30:55.730 --> 00:30:58.530
very easy for my parents
to say, [SPEAKING HINDI]..

00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:03.860
So I think it's important to
have these stories from India.

00:31:03.860 --> 00:31:06.650
Role models that, one--

00:31:06.650 --> 00:31:11.060
that inspire us, or fill us
with rage to do something,

00:31:11.060 --> 00:31:12.850
like the one that
Elahe mentioned.

00:31:12.850 --> 00:31:14.570
Or things that are aspirational.

00:31:14.570 --> 00:31:16.040
Women who look
like us, but who've

00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:20.130
dealt with a lot of adversity,
and still made it happen.

00:31:20.130 --> 00:31:21.295
That's sort of my summary.

00:31:21.295 --> 00:31:22.670
VINITA SURANA:
Can I add a point?

00:31:22.670 --> 00:31:23.590
SUJATA MUKHERJEE: Of course.

00:31:23.590 --> 00:31:24.410
Sorry, I didn't get your name.

00:31:24.410 --> 00:31:24.951
NAINA: Naina.

00:31:25.451 --> 00:31:27.900
VINITA SURANA: Naina.

00:31:27.900 --> 00:31:30.410
Naina, when you were
talking, every word

00:31:30.410 --> 00:31:32.240
you said-- the choice
of words you used--

00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:34.790
is the exact emotion
I could connect to.

00:31:34.790 --> 00:31:35.960
Because it happens to me.

00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:38.540
Like Elahe said, even
after proving yourself--

00:31:38.540 --> 00:31:39.464
a dime a dozen--

00:31:39.464 --> 00:31:40.880
your parents still
[? laud ?] you.

00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:41.588
They're like, no.

00:31:41.588 --> 00:31:42.440
Why you?

00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:44.320
You know, why should
we listen to you?

00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:47.980
Or why should we listen to
this reverse kind of advice?

00:31:47.980 --> 00:31:51.290
Because like you said, the
conditioning of the society.

00:31:51.290 --> 00:31:54.860
Or they have to go back there.

00:31:54.860 --> 00:31:57.680
And I completely resonate
with each and everything.

00:31:57.680 --> 00:32:00.590
But what I can say is--

00:32:00.590 --> 00:32:03.900
have you heard of the
theory of the slight edge?

00:32:03.900 --> 00:32:06.660
Just small, daily habits
that you do everyday.

00:32:06.660 --> 00:32:09.020
They need not be important.

00:32:09.020 --> 00:32:13.650
But when they add up-- when you
just put one marble in a jar,

00:32:13.650 --> 00:32:15.380
it doesn't make a difference.

00:32:15.380 --> 00:32:18.740
But you keep adding up for
100 days, it'll become.

00:32:18.740 --> 00:32:20.900
It will be something solid.

00:32:20.900 --> 00:32:23.720
So taking the points
from both of them,

00:32:23.720 --> 00:32:28.230
that perseverance is something
that we can't give up on.

00:32:28.230 --> 00:32:30.200
I our life We want
the best for our life.

00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:33.760
And if it takes for us
to convince our parents,

00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:37.160
or have those difficult
conversations with the people

00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:37.930
we love the most.

00:32:37.930 --> 00:32:39.388
Because we don't
want to hurt them.

00:32:39.388 --> 00:32:40.380
We respect them.

00:32:40.380 --> 00:32:42.530
And I think they love
us and respect us, too.

00:32:42.530 --> 00:32:44.090
It's just that
they don't know how

00:32:44.090 --> 00:32:48.590
to have a marriage
of the society

00:32:48.590 --> 00:32:53.460
and the new generation-- our
thoughts, and stuff like that.

00:32:53.460 --> 00:32:55.630
So I feel like in a line,
if I were to have to say.

00:32:55.630 --> 00:32:58.610
is that if you know the
background feeling--

00:32:58.610 --> 00:33:00.410
that they really love
and care for you,

00:33:00.410 --> 00:33:01.850
but they are helpless--

00:33:01.850 --> 00:33:04.190
I think they also
understand you.

00:33:04.190 --> 00:33:11.210
And if you can just have
that in the back of our mind,

00:33:11.210 --> 00:33:15.872
and then go to our
actionable items.

00:33:15.872 --> 00:33:18.080
RATNA SHEKAR: When my daughter
wanted to get married,

00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:19.370
I said, why don't
you go live with him?

00:33:19.370 --> 00:33:21.203
I mean, what is this
obsession with marriage

00:33:21.203 --> 00:33:24.630
and torturing all of us to do
this "Shaadi" and all that.

00:33:24.630 --> 00:33:26.250
But she was like saying, no.

00:33:26.250 --> 00:33:27.840
I must get married.

00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:29.934
So I think your generation
wants to get married.

00:33:29.934 --> 00:33:31.600
But our generations
likely more liberal.

00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:34.500
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:35.059
Seriously.

00:33:35.059 --> 00:33:35.725
This is serious.

00:33:35.725 --> 00:33:36.683
Please ask my daughter.

00:33:36.683 --> 00:33:38.970
And she was marrying
a guy from IT.

00:33:38.970 --> 00:33:41.617
And here, we were all
these creative people.

00:33:41.617 --> 00:33:43.700
Because I thought she
didn't know him well enough.

00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:47.150
So I said, live with him for
sometime before you decide.

00:33:47.150 --> 00:33:49.106
I feel if you want
marriage, please do that.

00:33:49.106 --> 00:33:51.230
If you want to meet with
somebody, a guy or a girl,

00:33:51.230 --> 00:33:52.160
please do that.

00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:54.290
Basically, we need to
liberate ourselves.

00:33:54.290 --> 00:33:55.540
This is what my point is.

00:33:55.540 --> 00:33:56.990
Don't say, my dad said this.

00:33:56.990 --> 00:33:58.599
Don't say, my husband said this.

00:33:58.599 --> 00:34:00.390
I've come from a very
difficult background,

00:34:00.390 --> 00:34:02.780
and it's not like
everything was given to me.

00:34:02.780 --> 00:34:04.220
But I just broke all barriers.

00:34:04.220 --> 00:34:05.030
I'm a single mom.

00:34:05.030 --> 00:34:06.960
Brought up two kids.

00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:09.535
And then when we started a
magazine, I just went forward.

00:34:09.535 --> 00:34:10.909
It was like an
in-house magazine.

00:34:10.909 --> 00:34:13.370
I said, why should in-house
magazine be boring?

00:34:13.370 --> 00:34:15.240
So just bring the
barriers in your minds.

00:34:15.240 --> 00:34:16.489
That is what we need to break.

00:34:16.489 --> 00:34:18.170
NAINA: And then not care
about what everybody says.

00:34:18.170 --> 00:34:19.400
RATNA SHEKAR: Not care!

00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:20.330
NAINA: You have to, otherwise--

00:34:20.330 --> 00:34:20.900
ELAHE HIPTOOLA: No, you do.

00:34:20.900 --> 00:34:21.590
RATNA SHEKAR: No, no, no.

00:34:21.590 --> 00:34:22.880
My mom loves me-- sorry.

00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:23.920
My mom loves me still.

00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:26.230
NAINA: When I say everybody,
I don't mean family.

00:34:26.230 --> 00:34:26.922
I mean people--

00:34:26.922 --> 00:34:27.630
RATNA SHEKAR: No.

00:34:27.630 --> 00:34:28.340
They respect me.

00:34:28.340 --> 00:34:28.639
Why am I--

00:34:28.639 --> 00:34:30.055
ELAHE HIPTOOLA:
Please understand.

00:34:30.055 --> 00:34:34.540
I am in this work
field, which we

00:34:34.540 --> 00:34:36.179
are looked under a microscope.

00:34:36.179 --> 00:34:38.900
But they rejoice if
our film flops, right?

00:34:38.900 --> 00:34:41.940
[SPEAKING HINDI] We come
from that kind of a thing.

00:34:41.940 --> 00:34:45.530
But if you really do
give that much weight

00:34:45.530 --> 00:34:48.560
as to what everybody
thinks, genuinely, you

00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:51.080
will not go one step forward.

00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:53.630
And please understand,
tomorrow [SPEAKING HINDI]..

00:34:53.630 --> 00:34:55.159
We're as good as
as the last Friday.

00:34:55.159 --> 00:34:57.033
Next Friday, someone
else will get rid of it.

00:34:57.033 --> 00:34:58.330
They don't care about you.

00:34:58.330 --> 00:35:00.280
You think that,
shit, man, they care.

00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:01.880
They don't give a damn.

00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:04.010
I might have won
the National Awards.

00:35:04.010 --> 00:35:05.222
Tomorrow, I am history.

00:35:05.222 --> 00:35:06.680
RATNA SHEKAR: You're
not headlines.

00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:08.920
ELAHE HIPTOOLA: Yeah,
I'm not headlines.

00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:10.400
Nobody cares about you.

00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:11.730
We think people care about you.

00:35:11.730 --> 00:35:12.980
RATNA SHEKAR: So don't worry--

00:35:12.980 --> 00:35:13.580
ELAHE HIPTOOLA: They
really don't care.

00:35:13.580 --> 00:35:15.538
RATNA SHEKAR: --about
the society, or whatever.

00:35:15.538 --> 00:35:16.954
ELAHE HIPTOOLA: Unfortunately.

00:35:16.954 --> 00:35:18.120
SUJATA MUKHERJEE: All right.

00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:19.890
So that's all we have time for.

00:35:19.890 --> 00:35:21.466
So it's a great note to end.

00:35:21.466 --> 00:35:23.330
RATNA SHEKAR: We should
extend it one more.

00:35:23.330 --> 00:35:25.430
SUJATA MUKHERJEE: But I think
there are some great lessons

00:35:25.430 --> 00:35:25.930
to learn.

00:35:25.930 --> 00:35:27.800
Thank you so much for
sharing your stories.

00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:29.120
Seize the opportunity.

00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:31.000
Show up.

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:32.540
Pursue your desires.

00:35:32.540 --> 00:35:34.900
Act from a place of empathy.

00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:37.490
Realize where your
families are coming from.

00:35:37.490 --> 00:35:41.180
But of course, be brave,
and pursue everything.

00:35:41.180 --> 00:35:42.100
Thank you everybody.
