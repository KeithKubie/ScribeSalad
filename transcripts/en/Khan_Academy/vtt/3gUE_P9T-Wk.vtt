00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.610
 

00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:04.059
In the video on the Cambrian
explosion, I talk about how

00:00:04.059 --> 00:00:06.450
surprisingly, or
somewhat surprisingly,

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.010
that animals were the first to
colonize or to move on land.

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.059
They did that before plants did.

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:14.600
And someone brought
up what I thought

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:15.641
was a very good question.

00:00:15.641 --> 00:00:18.860
If the animals were the
first, what did they eat?

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:21.020
So I thought that was
one, a good question.

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:23.770
So it justified a whole
video on clarifying

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:27.410
exactly who was
first on the land.

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:30.820
So right here, this is a
picture of algae on the coast.

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.140
This is kind of algal
scum right over here.

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.920
So this right here is algae.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.640
And just to be clear,
sometimes cyanobacteria,

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.690
which we talked about as the
first photosynthetic organism,

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.590
sometimes that's called
blue-green algae.

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:46.930
But that's really bacteria.

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:49.030
Algae is considered
to be eukaryotic.

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:52.070
And it just doesn't have the
structures of modern plants.

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:53.710
So this is algae right here.

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.320
And our best estimate
is that algae actually

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.070
colonized kind of coastal rocks
about 1.2 billion years ago.

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:08.420
So this is 1.2 billion
years ago, "g" giga,

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.110
billion years ago.

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.740
So if you wanted the first
thing that even resembled or was

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.500
close to plants or animals,
and if you consider algae close

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.950
to a plant, then this
would be the winner

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:20.160
of who got on land first.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.500
This is 1.2 billion years ago.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.880
Now in the last video where I
talk about animals colonizing

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.280
the land first,
they weren't animals

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.970
that only existed on land.

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.930
They would have been
animals that probably spent

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.664
most of their time in the ocean
collecting food or whatever.

00:01:36.664 --> 00:01:39.080
And then they would show up
on the land maybe to lay eggs.

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:40.700
And if you think about
it, back then the land

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:41.750
would have been a
really good place

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:43.166
to lay eggs because
there wouldn't

00:01:43.166 --> 00:01:44.540
have been much else on the land.

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.130
So you would have been
protected from predators.

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.110
So it might have been
slug-like creatures like this.

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.571
Some people talk about kind
of spider-like creatures.

00:01:54.571 --> 00:01:56.320
But it still would
have been at the coast.

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.380
And these would
have been creatures

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.450
that would have spend a
lot of time in the ocean

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.200
and some time in their land.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.150
So this is what I was
referring to as kind of animals

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.280
colonizing the
land before plants.

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.200
And this would have happened
about 530 million years ago.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:20.090
 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.490
Now, the first living organisms
to fully live on the land,

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:28.480
their whole life is on the
land, those would be plants.

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.490
So it depends if you think about
things that part of their life,

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:32.810
you'd get the animals.

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.080
Things that lived their
whole life on the land,

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.220
then you go back to the plants.

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.410
So this right here,
this is what we

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.840
think the first primitive
plants would have looked like.

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.340
And the evidence--
we actually don't

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.490
have fossils from these
plants themselves.

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:49.280
We have fossils of their spores.

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.510
But we think that the earliest
fossils of their spores,

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.440
which show that
these existed, were

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.310
about 475 million years ago.

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:03.050
So this is-- let me do
this in another color--

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:07.500
this right over here is
475 million years ago.

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.490
So 1.2 billion years
ago, you have the algae.

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:13.140
530 million years
ago, we have evidence

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.192
of things kind of
oozing out of the ocean

00:03:15.192 --> 00:03:16.900
and maybe laying their
eggs or something.

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.910
475 million years
ago, we have evidence

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.570
of what we would kind
of call really plants.

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:27.270
But the evidence is really
the fossils of their spores.

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:29.710
And then the first
evidence of real-- I

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:31.400
guess you could
call them animals

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:36.340
that spend their entire life on
the land, the oldest fossil we

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.470
have-- it was discovered
in Scotland fairly

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:41.660
recently, in 2004.

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:44.450
And this is the fossil
right over here.

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:48.490
It was actually discovered by
a bus driver, by Mike Newman.

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:52.380
Mike Newman, who is a
bus driver in Scotland.

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:54.355
And they actually named
the thing after him.

00:03:54.355 --> 00:03:56.860
It's called
Pneumodesmus newmani.

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:59.570
So they got the newmani
from Mike Newman.

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:02.830
And this fossil is
428 million years old.

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:10.450
 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:12.650
And right now, it's
the oldest fossil

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:14.850
we have of a true land animal.

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:18.690
So if you think about true
plants versus true land

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:21.300
animals, things that spent
their entire life on the land,

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:22.730
the plants do win out.

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:25.180
If you think about things
that spent part of their time

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.350
on the land, then the
animals probably won out.

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:30.850
If you view algae as plants,
then the plants won out.

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:32.766
So it depends where you
want to draw the line.

00:04:32.766 --> 00:04:36.140
And this first fossil,
this is of a myriapod

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:38.880
which just means a lot of legs.

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.250
Let me write over
here, myriapod.

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:43.750
You probably know
the word "myriad."

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.660
Myriad means a bunch of
things or a huge amount.

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:50.379
So myriapod, a huge
amount of legs.

00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:52.920
And you might be familiar with
the millipedes and centipedes.

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:53.855
Those are myriapods.

00:04:53.855 --> 00:04:57.690
And so those first primitive
myriapods, 428 million years

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:58.310
ago.

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:00.600
And they would have lived
off of plants, and maybe

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.240
other myriapods,
and other slugs,

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:05.190
and whatever other animals
they might have found.

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:07.100
They mind have looked
something like that.

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:09.349
So hopefully, that gives a
little bit of clarification

00:05:09.349 --> 00:05:13.404
over-- it wasn't like you
had dogs sitting on the land

00:05:13.404 --> 00:05:14.570
and they had nothing to eat.

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:17.280
 

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.980
It's kind of a gray area in what
you define a plant or an animal

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:22.017
and who gets kind of
the bragging rights

00:05:22.017 --> 00:05:23.350
for being the first on the land.

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:25.900
And it depends on really what
you consider a plant or animal

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:28.780
and whether spending
part of your life

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:32.250
on the land, whether spending
part of your life on the land

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:33.796
will actually qualify.

00:05:33.796 --> 00:05:34.296
