00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:03.630
So we're going to have one more quiz about variables. Variables are

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:06.140
a really important concept. We're going to use them all the time in

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:08.650
the programs that we write. So this quiz is going to test if

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:12.030
you can define a variable.yourself, and use that to do a computation.

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:15.360
So your goal for this quiz is to write Python code

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.740
that defines the variable age, gives it the value of your age

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.290
in years, and then prints out the number of days you've been

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:25.670
alive. You don't have to use your real age. If you don't

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:27.630
want to include your real age, you can make

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.830
up whatever age you are or you can use your

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:33.500
age in spirit. The important thing is that you can

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.140
define that in a variable and then do the computation.
