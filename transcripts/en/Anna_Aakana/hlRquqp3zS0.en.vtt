00:00:00.253 --> 00:00:02.005
The other day, my friend texted me.

00:00:02.005 --> 00:00:03.234
(phone chimes)

00:00:03.234 --> 00:00:05.515
[Hey there sexy mama baby llama lady]

00:00:05.515 --> 00:00:07.068
Clearly, it was not meant for me,

00:00:07.068 --> 00:00:08.338
so of course he said..

00:00:08.338 --> 00:00:10.841
[Whoops wrong person! My bad haha]

00:00:10.841 --> 00:00:12.815
But whenever someone says, "Whoops! Wrong person!"

00:00:12.815 --> 00:00:14.499
or "Ahhhhh! Wrong thread..."

00:00:14.499 --> 00:00:17.187
there's always this weird side of me that thinks,

00:00:17.187 --> 00:00:18.125
"You're a liar.

00:00:18.125 --> 00:00:20.437
Liar. You're a liar. You're a liar. You're a liar."

00:00:20.437 --> 00:00:22.157
Right? I mean, am I the only one who's just totally

00:00:22.157 --> 00:00:24.827
skeptical whenever you say "wrong person"?

00:00:25.612 --> 00:00:26.359
Speak.

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:29.968
(deep garbled voice) The encrypted file "Viva Oscar Viva"
has been transferred.

00:00:29.968 --> 00:00:31.414
Transferred..to who?

00:00:31.414 --> 00:00:33.132
Wait..who is this?

00:00:33.132 --> 00:00:34.651
This is Agent Anna, who is this?

00:00:34.651 --> 00:00:35.433
Woops.

00:00:35.433 --> 00:00:36.682
Wrong number.

00:00:38.187 --> 00:00:38.843
(phone beeps)

00:00:38.843 --> 00:00:40.778
(phone rings)

00:00:40.778 --> 00:00:41.531
(deep garbled voice) Hello?

00:00:41.531 --> 00:00:45.503
You dialed me on purpose just to let me know 
that you cracked the encryption on my file.

00:00:45.503 --> 00:00:47.316
What? No, why would I do that?

00:00:47.316 --> 00:00:49.032
To play mind games with me.

00:00:49.032 --> 00:00:50.560
To break my spirit.

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.905
To undermine my authority and throw it in my face.

00:00:53.905 --> 00:00:55.025
That makes no sense at all.

00:00:55.025 --> 00:00:56.561
This was just a horrible mistake.

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.187
(dial tone)

00:00:59.187 --> 00:00:59.841
But then..

00:00:59.841 --> 00:01:01.937
whenever I accidentally text the wrong person,

00:01:01.937 --> 00:01:03.849
I'm so paranoid that they don't believe me.

00:01:03.849 --> 00:01:04.842
Oh shoot..

00:01:04.842 --> 00:01:05.907
Nonono, augh..

00:01:05.907 --> 00:01:08.963
"sorry wrong person"..

00:01:09.937 --> 00:01:11.562
(beep) Hey it's Lisa, you know what to do.

00:01:11.562 --> 00:01:13.592
Hey! Lisa, this is Anna, I just texted you,

00:01:13.592 --> 00:01:16.217
but it was actually--it's the wrong Lisa, so that was totally..

00:01:16.217 --> 00:01:18.811
my bad. So just ignore that text, okay? I'll see you soon, bye!

00:01:20.573 --> 00:01:21.337
Lisa..

00:01:21.937 --> 00:01:25.402
(muttering)

00:01:27.882 --> 00:01:28.712
(whoosh)

00:01:31.937 --> 00:01:34.129
"Dear Lisa,

00:01:34.129 --> 00:01:40.469
The SMS message from me to you on 6/23 at 12:24PM

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:42.218
was a mistake, I'm so sorry."

00:01:42.218 --> 00:01:42.910
Okay.

00:01:44.356 --> 00:01:49.156
(panting)

00:01:49.156 --> 00:01:49.877
Oh god..

00:01:49.877 --> 00:01:50.689
OWL!

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:51.122
(hooting)

00:01:51.122 --> 00:01:52.906
TAKE THIS MESSAGE TO LISA!

00:01:52.906 --> 00:01:53.541
AUGH!

00:01:53.972 --> 00:01:57.174
But I feel like my frantic need to set the record straight

00:01:57.174 --> 00:01:58.755
only seems more suspicious.

00:01:59.438 --> 00:01:59.853
(screams)

00:01:59.853 --> 00:02:00.878
WRONG PERSON!

00:02:00.878 --> 00:02:02.904
What about you? Have you ever texted the wrong person?

00:02:02.904 --> 00:02:05.684
Or received a message you were not supposed to get?

00:02:05.684 --> 00:02:07.563
Or maybe, just maybe,

00:02:07.563 --> 00:02:08.937
you do it on purpose..

00:02:08.937 --> 00:02:11.251
as a passive aggressive power play.

00:02:11.251 --> 00:02:16.378
"Thanks so much for proposing to me today honey!

00:02:16.378 --> 00:02:22.670
I can't wait to get married to such a 
handsome, rich, and well endowed man."

00:02:23.998 --> 00:02:26.688
"Oh noooooo

00:02:26.688 --> 00:02:32.780
so sorry that was meant for my new boyfriend.

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:33.762
My bad"

00:02:34.311 --> 00:02:35.565
(chuckles)

00:02:35.565 --> 00:02:37.406
You know, I told my brother about the premise for this video,

00:02:37.406 --> 00:02:39.658
and instead of like, laughing and relating to it,

00:02:39.658 --> 00:02:40.294
he just said

00:02:40.294 --> 00:02:43.285
"You are a very paranoid person."

00:02:43.285 --> 00:02:47.446
So I'm hoping that someone somewhere across 
this WiFi connection can actually relate to this.

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.285
I'm Anna Akana.

00:02:49.285 --> 00:02:50.263
Stay awesome Gotham.

00:02:50.263 --> 00:02:53.755
I'd like to thank Lundberg family farms for sponsoring today's video.

00:02:53.755 --> 00:02:54.968
Do you have mental mishaps?

00:02:54.968 --> 00:02:57.221
Like you can't find your glasses when they're on your head,

00:02:57.221 --> 00:02:58.593
calling your boss "mom",

00:02:58.593 --> 00:03:02.940
or even maybe just replying all to an email 
containing juicy government secrets.

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.816
That stuff happens when you're undergrained.

00:03:05.404 --> 00:03:09.944
Lundberg can help. Their tasty line of whole 
grains of variety rice-y goodness, quinoa,

00:03:09.944 --> 00:03:12.970
and organic rice cakes can get you to grainiac clearance.

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:17.331
Lundberg has been providing whole grain goodness 
while protecting and improving the environment

00:03:17.331 --> 00:03:20.752
with their eco-positive farming methods since 1937.

00:03:20.752 --> 00:03:21.908
Proving this:

00:03:21.908 --> 00:03:23.538
Good doesn't go out of style.

00:03:23.538 --> 00:03:27.311
