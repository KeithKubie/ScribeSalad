problem both solar radiation and cosmic

rays are both a problem we don't have a

dense atmosphere on Mars it's only about

dense atmosphere on Mars it's only about
 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.089
dense atmosphere on Mars it's only about
1/100 the density of the atmosphere on

1/100 the density of the atmosphere on
 

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:20.160
1/100 the density of the atmosphere on
earth and therefore they're not a lot of
