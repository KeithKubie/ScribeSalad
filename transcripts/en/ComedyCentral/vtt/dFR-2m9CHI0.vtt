SHE'S GOTTA GO
AND DO HER OWN THING.

00:00:09.209 --> 00:00:10.844
AND SHE DOESN'T KNOW
HOW TO TELL HIM.

00:00:10.878 --> 00:00:13.280
SO SHE DECIDES...
- I GOTTA WRITE A SONG.

00:00:13.313 --> 00:00:15.415
BECAUSE THAT'S HOW--
WHEN YOU'RE DOLLY PARTON,

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:18.218

YOURSELF.

00:00:25.125 --> 00:00:29.696
- SHE SITS HIM DOWN,
AND SHE SINGS TO HIM.

00:00:40.007 --> 00:00:41.575
AND IF YOU--
IF YOU LISTEN TO THAT SONG,

00:00:41.608 --> 00:00:43.977
IN THE COURSE OF THAT SONG
SHE MAKES THIS PROMISE

00:00:44.011 --> 00:00:45.779

00:00:45.812 --> 00:00:48.215

00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:13.307

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:14.508 line:0%

- WHAT DOES SHE DO NEXT?

00:02:08.695 --> 00:02:11.765
