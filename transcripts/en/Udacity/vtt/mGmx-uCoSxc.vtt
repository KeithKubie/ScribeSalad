00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.780
So you don't need to enable memcache in web.xml.

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.740
You don't need to do any configuration like that. And

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.360
you don't need to add @Cache to each property,

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:13.680
but you do need to add the @Cache annotation to

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.250
the class. So, this is the correct answer. And

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:18.980
you don't have to write any code to save your

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.710
property values in memcache. Objectify will do it all for

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.240
you. That's one of the really cool things about memcache
