00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:03.850
MALE SPEAKER: So about five
years ago, I had the pleasure

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:07.920
of introducing a new author to
an Authors at Google talk.

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:09.700
And this author's name
was Tim Ferriss.

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.190
He had a new book that had
just come out called "The

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:14.980
4-Hour Workweek." It
was a surprise hit.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.500
And it spent about four years
on the bestseller list.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.110
Not too long after, he had a
second book called "The 4-Hour

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:24.200
Body," which was a little bit
more about hacking the body,

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.150
weight loss, nutrition.

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:27.890
A lot of people I know
here at Google have

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:28.520
lost a bunch of weight.

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.710
I myself have lost about
20 pounds doing that.

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:33.470
So I'm very excited to have
Tim here for his new book,

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:37.870
"The 4-Hour Chef." It's a book
that starts with cooking and

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:39.910
then goes into food
in general.

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:44.070
It's also a bit of a primer on
approaching any topic and

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.890
learning it and learning
it towards mastery.

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.120
And Tim's here to talk
about the book, but

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.370
also about other topics.

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.110
And we'll have a lot
of time for Q&amp;A.

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:53.070
And so I'm very excited to
have Tim here today.

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.959
Please join me in
welcoming him.

00:00:54.959 --> 00:01:01.060
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:02.380
TIMOTHY FERRISS: Thank
you, kind sir.

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:05.349
Trevor was subjected to some
of my experimentation also

00:01:05.349 --> 00:01:08.810
throughout this book with
respect to food, which in the

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.400
beginning was not very
pleasant at all.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.050
MALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:16.110
TIMOTHY FERRISS: So it's been
fun to visit Google as many

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.000
times as I have.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.920
And certainly in the first
visit, I had a lot more hair

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.490
and many fewer book sales.

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.460
But this book is perhaps
the most exciting

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:25.840
to me of all three.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.990
So I'll start off with a very
dramatic trailer that I think

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:31.790
gives a basic sort
of overview.

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.580
And then we'll jump into the
presentation, which I'll try

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:35.980
to keep really short, or
as short as I can.

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:38.090
And then a bunch of Q&amp;A,
because that's when I

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:39.010
have the most fun.

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:41.496
So let's do the trailer first.

00:01:41.496 --> 00:02:50.170
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:51.420
TIMOTHY FERRISS: All right.

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.360
So the presentation's all
downhill from here.

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.860
That was courtesy
of Adam Patch.

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.690
Adam Patch directed and
did the post on that.

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.640
There are a few things that
came up in that video that

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.200
will reappear through
the presentation.

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.600
It was all filmed in Seattle,
at Delve Kitchen.

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.390
So if anyone's interested in
molecular gastronomy, things

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:18.460
like that, Chris Young, who used
to run the experimental

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:21.190
kitchen for The Fat Duck in
London when it became number

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:23.880
one ranked in the world, helped
with all of that, as

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:24.880
well as with the science
section.

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.830
But let's start at
the beginning.

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:28.690
So "The 4-Hour Chef, Accelerated
Learning for

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.830
Accelerated Times--" this book
of the three has the most

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:35.430
confusing title and subtitle
combination, I think.

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.402
And that is because for the last
four or five years, my

00:03:37.402 --> 00:03:39.000
readers have been asking me
for a book on accelerated

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.770
learning, mostly because of my
talk about smart drugs and

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:45.160
language acquisition and
things like that.

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.680
The problem is, writing a book
on learning without a good

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.140
context is really boring
to read and even

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:51.640
more boring to write.

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.840
So I ultimately chanced
upon thinking of

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.380
cooking for a few reasons.

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:58.450
The first was it was
a skill that I had

00:03:58.450 --> 00:03:59.870
quit many times before.

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:02.930
I had failed at it many, many
times before, despite trying,

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:05.940
much like swimming, which was
covered in "The 4-Hour Body."

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:07.280
Secondly was--

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.940
I think as many people feel
these days in a digital

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:13.740
world-- there's a certain sense
of angst that I felt

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:14.905
every time I closed my laptop.

00:04:14.905 --> 00:04:17.110
I'd accomplished a lot of
work, but I had nothing

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:18.390
physical to show for it.

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:23.230
And I really wanted to reclaim
my manual literacy and build

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.980
physical things.

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:25.790
And I thought that would
be woodworking.

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:28.140
But there's always an excuse not
to go to Oakland to do it.

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:29.560
And I didn't want some crappy
bird house in my

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.270
living room, anyway.

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:33.520
And I saw my girlfriend cooking
one night, and I said,

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.910
that can be my dojo.

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:39.940
That can be where I learn to
use my thumbs for something

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:42.570
besides the space bar.

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:46.390
And it turned out to be really
life-altering for me to

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:48.340
reclaim that part of myself.

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:52.390
And lastly, because food
involves all five senses, you

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:57.350
can really use it to create sort
of a Spidey sense in all

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:58.840
of those senses, which
is pretty wild.

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.400
And it transfers to almost
everything else.

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:05.050
And this shot, this opening shot
here that you guys can

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:08.230
see, it's two pictures,
identical pictures.

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:10.600
This is the entranceway to
Alinea Restaurant in Chicago,

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.290
which at the time I wrote
the book was number one

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:13.780
ranked in the US.

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:15.880
And I spent three days there.

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:19.110
And in Alinea Restaurant, they
test every assumption

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:21.045
possible, every convention
possible.

00:05:21.045 --> 00:05:23.200
You get menus at the end instead
of at the beginning.

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:24.940
When you walk in, no
one greets you.

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:28.040
It's this red hallway,
completely soundproof.

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:30.630
Until you get to the end,
nothing happens.

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:33.290
Then motion sensors open a
hidden door, and people greet

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:34.540
you by name.

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:36.600
Everything's been tested,
including the business model.

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:39.250
And I encourage people to look
at Next Restaurant for how

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:42.080
they sell out their entire
season for the restaurant in,

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:44.330
in some cases, 10 to
30 seconds online.

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:46.930
It's very, very cool.

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:50.690
The guiding tenet when looking
at sports performance, when

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:54.190
looking at work performance,
when looking at learning

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:57.120
performance is this.

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:58.680
So "whenever you find yourself
on the side of the majority,

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:01.200
it's time to pause and reflect."
And my job over the

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:04.100
last five years, but certainly
something I've obsessed on for

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:07.790
15-plus years, is finding the
anomalies, finding the

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:09.470
freaks-- you know, the people
who are really good at what

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:13.480
they do despite having poor raw
materials or very informal

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:16.033
training or no training
at all.

00:06:16.033 --> 00:06:17.450
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:19.650
This is to give people-- how
many people have seen this

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:20.580
video before?

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:21.330
A handful.

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:22.590
OK.

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:23.680
This is in South Africa.

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:26.070
This is just to give you an idea
of what I do to myself in

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:28.530
the name of experimentation.

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:31.380
I had been effectively
told-- this is the

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:32.250
side of my right leg.

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:35.660
I'm recording this with a Flip
camera, in Cape Town at one of

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:37.560
the top sports science
institutes.

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:42.530
And I had been told, in effect,
through Navigenics and

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:45.400
other types of DNA testing that
I lacked the ability to

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:48.380
produce fast twitch muscle
fiber properly.

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:51.650
So this genetic determinism
was very depressing.

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:53.290
But that didn't square
with my experience

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:54.340
in sports, for instance.

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:57.530
I'd been an All-American in
high school in wrestling.

00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:03.670
So I decided to skip all of
the theory and just remove

00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:04.640
samples from my leg.

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:08.130
And the way it works with a
biopsy is they insert a hollow

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:12.020
tube, slightly larger than a
pen, into your leg, apply

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:13.860
suction, pull the tissue
in, and then rotate

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:15.630
it to cut it out.

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:18.660
And I'm not going to run this
for very much longer.

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:23.280
But last time I showed this, I
actually did it at a lunch

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:28.040
meeting, which was
my Long Island

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:30.140
sophistication coming out.

00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:33.550
In any case, I'm not going
to go too deep

00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:36.122
into the results here.

00:07:36.122 --> 00:07:36.593
-All right.

00:07:36.593 --> 00:07:38.350
Who wants to sign up?

00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:39.025
TIMOTHY FERRISS: All right.

00:07:39.025 --> 00:07:40.500
I'll come to this in a second.

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:44.690
The punch line to that is that
something along the lines of

00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:47.570
more than 40% of my muscle fiber
was in fact fast twitch

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:50.770
muscle fiber, type IIa, which
is fully trainable.

00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:53.960
So the raw materials you start
with, perhaps the skills that

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:55.980
you've put on the shelf because
you couldn't master

00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:59.960
them or couldn't even get
started learning them, do not

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:00.960
seal your fate.

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:04.450
And the way you get around that
fate, the way you sort of

00:08:04.450 --> 00:08:07.690
head-fake what you think are
your limitations, is by

00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:08.480
testing assumptions.

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:11.190
This is another shot from
Alinea Restaurant.

00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:13.490
And this is one of
the last courses.

00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:15.910
This has been plated
by Grant Achatz.

00:08:15.910 --> 00:08:18.860
So chef Grant Achatz,
A-C-H-A-T-Z, is really worth

00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:19.560
taking a look at.

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:21.630
And I look at him very closely
in the Professional

00:08:21.630 --> 00:08:22.720
section of the book.

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:26.470
But when Jean-Georges
Vongerichten, who's a very,

00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:29.600
very, very world-class chef,
who runs many restaurants

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:32.429
including ABC Kitchen in New
York City, was asked, who do

00:08:32.429 --> 00:08:34.740
you fear among your colleagues,
it didn't take him

00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:36.385
more than a split second
to say Grant Achatz.

00:08:36.385 --> 00:08:38.260
He does things I can't
understand.

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.710
I don't understand how he
creates the things he creates.

00:08:40.710 --> 00:08:43.250
For instance, they wanted
to test plating.

00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:45.050
Why don't we have
bigger plates?

00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:47.580
Well, they couldn't fit a
4-foot-diameter plate through

00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:48.900
the doorways to and
from the kitchen.

00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:52.920
So instead, they found a
special, effectively

00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:56.150
food-grade latex from a sex shop
in Paris and imported it

00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:59.080
to create tablecloths where
they could use the entire

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:00.690
table as a plate.

00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:03.270
And on the right-hand side,
you see a dark chocolate

00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:05.910
pinata that is shattered on
the table and releases all

00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:09.300
this liquid nitrogen and crazy
stuff, which is just awesome.

00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:10.380
And it tasted good.

00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:13.730
A lot of these food-as-theater
shows end up producing really

00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:14.370
crappy food.

00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:18.500
But Alinea does not
have crappy food.

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:20.620
This is an example
of transfer.

00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:22.800
When you start to think
creatively about food--

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:27.030
because I was an anti-cook
my entire life.

00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:29.150
Even a few weeks prior to
starting research for this

00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:31.370
book, I had two friends who are
very good cooks come over

00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:32.430
to help cook dinner.

00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:34.100
They said, grab the wine
and we'll talk about

00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:35.370
business, catch up.

00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:39.340
They came over, and I had
mustard and white wine in my

00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:42.870
fridge, including some, like,
biohazard unidentifiable food.

00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:44.020
And they asked me where
my olive oil was.

00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:44.890
And I said, olive oil.

00:09:44.890 --> 00:09:45.190
Olive oil.

00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:46.090
Oh, it's in the freezer.

00:09:46.090 --> 00:09:47.092
It's in the freezer.

00:09:47.092 --> 00:09:48.100
Why is your olive oil
in the freezer?

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:49.790
I really was starting
from ground zero.

00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:52.310
And when you start to think
about food creatively,

00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:54.020
anything creatively,
it transfers.

00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:56.530
So this was about halfway
through my meal at Alinea.

00:09:56.530 --> 00:10:00.420
We had been stuck in design
gridlock on the cover.

00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:02.930
And it just came to me after
one of their more inventive

00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:05.060
dishes that the cover could be
something like this on the

00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:06.130
left, which I sketched out.

00:10:06.130 --> 00:10:08.030
And then it turned into
the final cover.

00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:11.590
So even if you hate cooking,
hopefully you love food.

00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:14.730
And taking even a week to
experiment with all of those

00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:18.880
senses in the kitchen, even if
you stop after that week, will

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:21.030
take a lot of your life that
is currently in black and

00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:23.680
white and turn it into high def,
which is a really cool

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:26.530
effect that is persistent.

00:10:26.530 --> 00:10:28.130
This is something you
saw in the trailer.

00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:33.140
This is one of my old friends
when I inhaled something

00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:34.960
through nasal inhalation.

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:37.880
This is vasopressin, which is
an antidiuretic hormone.

00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:41.600
It's prescribed as desmopressin
to kids in some

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:43.930
cases who bed-wet past
a certain age.

00:10:43.930 --> 00:10:47.060
I used it starting freshman year
in college to ace Chinese

00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:48.570
character quizzes.

00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:50.110
And it has very interesting
applications

00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:50.850
to short-term memory.

00:10:50.850 --> 00:10:56.180
So I would take two shots and
flip through a book almost as

00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:58.670
quickly as I could turn the
pages and score a 95 to 100%.

00:10:58.670 --> 00:10:59.910
It was pretty cool.

00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:03.260
Now, as you might imagine,
snorting antidiuretic hormone

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:07.080
is not the best long-term
strategy.

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:10.350
And pretty quickly thereafter,
headaches set in and all sorts

00:11:10.350 --> 00:11:13.170
of issues, because I was testing
a whole slew of other

00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:14.350
drugs at the same time.

00:11:14.350 --> 00:11:17.770
And I started to focus
on method.

00:11:17.770 --> 00:11:19.630
I didn't continue with-- well,
that's not entirely true.

00:11:19.630 --> 00:11:20.360
I'm still interested
in the drugs.

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:21.280
We can get to that
if you guys want.

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:27.980
But the point being there are
actual methods, recipes, that

00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:31.450
the world's fastest learners use
to learn what they learn,

00:11:31.450 --> 00:11:33.420
whether that's Daniel Tammet
in the UK, who learned

00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:35.290
Icelandic in seven days well
enough to be interviewed on

00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:40.150
TV, whether that's Ed Cooke, who
plays a pretty big part in

00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:44.780
the book, who trained Joshua
Foer from zero to national

00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:46.670
memory champion in the US,
which was chronicled in

00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:48.690
"Moonwalking with Einstein."
There is a

00:11:48.690 --> 00:11:50.740
method to this stuff.

00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:54.980
Tango, fighting, marksmanship,
cooking, languages--

00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:57.110
there are methods.

00:11:57.110 --> 00:12:01.950
And this was the common method
that I distilled from many of

00:12:01.950 --> 00:12:04.280
these different experts--

00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:04.670
DiSSS.

00:12:04.670 --> 00:12:06.920
This is an acronym, of course.

00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:10.880
And it stands for
Deconstruction, Selection,

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:11.850
Sequencing, and Stakes.

00:12:11.850 --> 00:12:13.570
And I'm going to breeze through
this pretty quickly.

00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:16.360
I'll give a few examples of
what I mean, then a few

00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:18.300
take-aways, and then we
can jump into Q&amp;A.

00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:19.900
But this is the basic process.

00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:23.120
Deconstruction is taking
something very big and

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:25.220
intimidating, like learning
how to swim.

00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:26.570
I couldn't swim until
three years ago.

00:12:26.570 --> 00:12:27.470
And I grew up on Long Island.

00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:29.460
How embarrassing is that?

00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:30.690
But I was deathly afraid
of swimming.

00:12:30.690 --> 00:12:33.910
I'd had a couple of
semi-drowning experiences,

00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:35.590
have trouble with
my left lung.

00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:38.300
So I took swimming and broke it
down into, OK, what are the

00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:39.540
arms doing in freestyle?

00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:41.460
What are the legs doing
in freestyle?

00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:44.350
Learning to swim is too big,
just like learning a language.

00:12:44.350 --> 00:12:46.530
And then, what are my
failure points, my

00:12:46.530 --> 00:12:47.990
personal failure points?

00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:49.230
Why haven't I learned
this already?

00:12:49.230 --> 00:12:52.700
So for me, it was every time
I went in to try to take a

00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:54.010
class, I would be given
a kickboard.

00:12:54.010 --> 00:12:55.270
And they would say, all right.

00:12:55.270 --> 00:12:56.550
Do a couple laps.

00:12:56.550 --> 00:12:57.760
And then we'll get
you started.

00:12:57.760 --> 00:12:59.290
And I would flail around
like a drowning monkey.

00:12:59.290 --> 00:12:59.930
And I wouldn't move.

00:12:59.930 --> 00:13:02.120
And I would just be embarrassed,
exhausted.

00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:02.880
And I would quit.

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:04.190
So it's like, all right.

00:13:04.190 --> 00:13:08.230
How would I learn to swim if
I had to avoid kicking?

00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:11.350
And it gives you a specificity
to then look for the answers.

00:13:11.350 --> 00:13:14.680
And through a friend of mine
named Chris Sacca-- who some

00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:15.615
of you may know--

00:13:15.615 --> 00:13:18.960
a very astute investor, who was
terrible at swimming and

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:21.690
then completed an Iron Man, I
found total immersion method,

00:13:21.690 --> 00:13:22.540
which, guess what?

00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:24.940
Doesn't really use kicking.

00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:26.810
So deconstruction is taking
something really big and

00:13:26.810 --> 00:13:28.970
making it more tackleable.

00:13:28.970 --> 00:13:32.640
Selection is a common thread
through all of the books that

00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:33.400
I've written.

00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:34.490
This is the 80/20 analysis.

00:13:34.490 --> 00:13:38.210
So what are the 20% of tools,
activities, approaches,

00:13:38.210 --> 00:13:41.280
coaches, whatever it might be
that will get you 80% or more

00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:43.560
of the outcomes, the results
that you want?

00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:47.020
This is really easily applied
to languages.

00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:49.930
Like most people, when I studied
Spanish in junior high

00:13:49.930 --> 00:13:52.280
and whatnot, I was terrible.

00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:54.300
I couldn't string a basic
conversation together for 30

00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:56.050
seconds after three
years of studying.

00:13:56.050 --> 00:13:58.290
And I concluded I was
bad at languages.

00:13:58.290 --> 00:13:58.610
No.

00:13:58.610 --> 00:13:59.230
Not so.

00:13:59.230 --> 00:14:01.550
I just had things
all mixed up.

00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:04.420
If you instead look to someone
like Michel Thomas--

00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:08.230
M-I-C-H-E-L Thomas, his original
audio recordings, who

00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:09.440
was a Holocaust survivor,
then an

00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:11.610
intelligence officer in Europe--

00:14:11.610 --> 00:14:15.030
you could acquire the basics of
Spanish grammar in two or

00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:16.400
three days.

00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:19.470
And then if you used flash
cards, like vis-ed.com, V-I-S,

00:14:19.470 --> 00:14:23.840
hyphen, E-D dot com, which are
high-frequency word lists and

00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:26.870
flash cards, you could become
functionally fluent in a

00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:29.820
language like Spanish in 8 to
12 weeks without that much

00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:30.820
difficulty.

00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:34.910
And I say that now because I've
applied this to Japanese,

00:14:34.910 --> 00:14:39.610
Mandarin Chinese, German,
Spanish, and so on.

00:14:39.610 --> 00:14:41.240
It's very replicable.

00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:41.650
OK.

00:14:41.650 --> 00:14:42.290
Sequencing--

00:14:42.290 --> 00:14:44.620
this is something that I don't
think has been addressed very

00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:46.530
well by other books.

00:14:46.530 --> 00:14:49.270
And there aren't really many
books on accelerated learning

00:14:49.270 --> 00:14:50.510
to begin with.

00:14:50.510 --> 00:14:52.470
Sequencing is kind of
the secret sauce.

00:14:52.470 --> 00:14:54.770
So a friend of mine, for
instance, Josh Waitzkin--

00:14:54.770 --> 00:14:56.130
does anyone know that name?

00:14:56.130 --> 00:14:58.820
He was the basis for a book and
a movie called "Searching

00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:01.370
for Bobby Fischer." He's one of
the most incredible chess

00:15:01.370 --> 00:15:02.585
players in the world.

00:15:02.585 --> 00:15:05.130
He opted out of the scene after
all of the attention

00:15:05.130 --> 00:15:06.220
from "Searching for
Bobby Fischer."

00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:09.630
But the way he was originally
taught chess by his first

00:15:09.630 --> 00:15:12.810
really formal coach
was backwards.

00:15:12.810 --> 00:15:14.175
He learned from the
end game first.

00:15:14.175 --> 00:15:16.680
So instead of starting with
openings, which everyone does,

00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:20.340
he began with pawn and king
versus pawn, to learn flexible

00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:23.410
principles and techniques that
could apply everywhere.

00:15:23.410 --> 00:15:25.940
And as a result, his rate of
progress was much faster.

00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:28.510
When I learned tango
in Argentina--

00:15:28.510 --> 00:15:30.460
which was a complete
accident--

00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:32.640
but from my first class to the
world championships was five

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:33.270
and a half months.

00:15:33.270 --> 00:15:34.750
And part of the reason I was
able to make that rate of

00:15:34.750 --> 00:15:37.730
progress is because I looked
at how to play with the

00:15:37.730 --> 00:15:38.350
sequencing.

00:15:38.350 --> 00:15:40.500
And I learned the female
role first.

00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:43.130
I learned how to follow before
I learned how to lead.

00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:47.020
And it allowed me to progress
much, much faster.

00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:50.100
There are a lot of very good
coaches who had also focused

00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:50.570
on sequencing.

00:15:50.570 --> 00:15:53.730
Stan Utley, who is a very
well-known short-game-- ie

00:15:53.730 --> 00:15:56.000
putting and whatnot-- golf
coach, says people come to me

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:56.350
all the time.

00:15:56.350 --> 00:15:57.150
They say, how's my form?

00:15:57.150 --> 00:15:57.930
How's my form?

00:15:57.930 --> 00:15:58.760
Can you correct my form?

00:15:58.760 --> 00:15:59.550
He's like, your form is fine.

00:15:59.550 --> 00:16:02.100
You're just moving the
pieces out of order.

00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:03.700
So playing with sequencing
is really important.

00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:09.410
And then stakes is also
very neglected.

00:16:09.410 --> 00:16:11.700
One of my friends, AJ Jacobs,
writes for "Esquire." He's a

00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:14.110
hysterical, hysterical writer,
a very good writer too.

00:16:14.110 --> 00:16:15.580
"The Year of Living Biblically"

00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:16.350
is one of my favorites.

00:16:16.350 --> 00:16:19.630
But when he was trying to lose
weight-- so he's a Jewish guy.

00:16:19.630 --> 00:16:21.890
He gave one of his friends
a check to the KKK for

00:16:21.890 --> 00:16:23.360
$1,000 in his name.

00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:25.625
And he said, if I do not hit
my weight-loss goal, I want

00:16:25.625 --> 00:16:29.010
you to mail this to the KKK.

00:16:29.010 --> 00:16:32.430
That is what we call
an incentive.

00:16:32.430 --> 00:16:34.290
So for most people, they're
like, oh, I'd love to learn to

00:16:34.290 --> 00:16:35.000
play the guitar.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:36.330
I'd love to lose weight.

00:16:36.330 --> 00:16:38.400
But if you fail at those things,
nothing happens.

00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:40.440
You don't get fired from trying
to learn the guitar.

00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:42.620
You just don't do it.

00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:45.000
So an easy way to
create stakes--

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.290
betting pools with friends
are one way.

00:16:47.290 --> 00:16:49.280
But you could also
go to stickk.com.

00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:50.320
I have no affiliation
with it--

00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:52.710
S-T-I-C-K-K dot com.

00:16:52.710 --> 00:16:55.360
It was originally set up by
or conceived of by a Yale

00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:57.130
professor as a commitment
store.

00:16:57.130 --> 00:16:58.230
Here's how it works.

00:16:58.230 --> 00:17:00.430
Take an amount of money that
would be painful to lose,

00:17:00.430 --> 00:17:02.620
because you'll work a lot harder
to avoid the stick than

00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:04.150
you will to get the carrot.

00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:05.020
Put in some money.

00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:06.180
It goes into escrow.

00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:07.119
Then you choose your goal.

00:17:07.119 --> 00:17:09.079
Let's just say it's guitar
twice a week.

00:17:09.079 --> 00:17:09.440
Great.

00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:10.490
Then you choose your
most merciless

00:17:10.490 --> 00:17:12.540
friend to be the referee.

00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:14.950
And if you don't--

00:17:14.950 --> 00:17:15.770
oh no.

00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:16.440
What happened?

00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:19.349
[FEEDBACK]

00:17:19.349 --> 00:17:19.760
Man.

00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:21.010
Tech support?

00:17:23.970 --> 00:17:26.970
"Eyes Wide Shut," anyone?

00:17:26.970 --> 00:17:27.190
OK.

00:17:27.190 --> 00:17:28.920
So we'll have to reclaim
the screen somehow.

00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:29.400
I'm not sure.

00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:30.670
I didn't touch anything.

00:17:30.670 --> 00:17:32.130
I can also riff without
it, but it would be

00:17:32.130 --> 00:17:35.310
nice to get that back.

00:17:35.310 --> 00:17:35.850
Where the hell was I?

00:17:35.850 --> 00:17:36.300
Oh.

00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:36.590
All right.

00:17:36.590 --> 00:17:38.140
So escrow.

00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:40.300
Then you choose an
anti-charity.

00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:41.775
So you have your merciless
friend who is going to referee

00:17:41.775 --> 00:17:44.020
and confirm or deny that you
did what you said you were

00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:44.180
going to do.

00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:47.300
And then you choose
an anti-charity.

00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:49.780
Currently the most effective
anti-charity is the George W

00:17:49.780 --> 00:17:52.920
Bush Congressional Library.

00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:54.460
Right below that--

00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:55.430
this is from the stats.

00:17:55.430 --> 00:17:56.340
I'm not taking a position.

00:17:56.340 --> 00:17:57.660
I'm just saying.

00:17:57.660 --> 00:17:59.360
Right below that you
have pro-choice,

00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:00.560
pro-life, duh, duh, duh.

00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:04.340
So whatever nonprofit you would
rather nuke than give

00:18:04.340 --> 00:18:06.790
money to, choose that.

00:18:06.790 --> 00:18:09.930
And then if your friend or
another referee says you

00:18:09.930 --> 00:18:11.200
didn't follow directions,
guess what?

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:13.460
That money goes to that
nonprofit in your name on the

00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:14.950
record forever.

00:18:14.950 --> 00:18:16.750
You will perform miracles.

00:18:16.750 --> 00:18:18.740
People who have no instruction
whatsoever,

00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:19.380
it's just like, no.

00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:20.480
I'm not even going to tell
you how to lose weight.

00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:22.180
But you have to lose weight or
this will go to the KKK.

00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:24.500
Man, miraculous.

00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:28.080
So how many people here would
like to, let's say, learn to

00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:28.750
play guitar?

00:18:28.750 --> 00:18:29.870
I think that's pretty common.

00:18:29.870 --> 00:18:30.510
I would.

00:18:30.510 --> 00:18:32.110
Anybody?

00:18:32.110 --> 00:18:35.410
So go on YouTube and search
Axis of Awesome.

00:18:35.410 --> 00:18:36.060
So the Axis--

00:18:36.060 --> 00:18:36.440
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:38.090
TIMOTHY FERRISS: Yeah, right?

00:18:38.090 --> 00:18:40.660
So Axis of Awesome is
a comedy troupe.

00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:42.300
It's a musical comedy troupe.

00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:46.100
And they will play almost every
popular pop song that

00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:49.220
you can imagine using
four or five chords.

00:18:49.220 --> 00:18:50.120
So guess what?

00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:53.660
Those four or five chords are
your minimal effective dose.

00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:56.770
That is where you should invest
your time to have early

00:18:56.770 --> 00:18:59.810
wins and get the most positive
feedback possible, as well as

00:18:59.810 --> 00:19:02.690
getting 80% or more of the
outputs that you would want,

00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:05.770
especially in that beginning
novice stage.

00:19:05.770 --> 00:19:07.060
From a sequencing standpoint--

00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:09.580
I'm just kind of making this up
as we go along until we get

00:19:09.580 --> 00:19:10.390
visuals, if we get them.

00:19:10.390 --> 00:19:12.060
It's not a big deal
if we don't.

00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:14.290
In the case of, let's
say, cookbooks--

00:19:14.290 --> 00:19:20.430
and I want people to believe
they can become world class in

00:19:20.430 --> 00:19:23.690
almost any skill within six
months if they apply

00:19:23.690 --> 00:19:25.350
themselves properly.

00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:28.750
And by learning how to learn,
you also by default

00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:29.720
learn how to teach.

00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:31.710
So you can teach your
kids and whatnot.

00:19:31.710 --> 00:19:35.480
One of the ways that you'll
notice this has been taught

00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:37.700
indirectly through the book is
fixing some of the common

00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:39.370
problems with cookbooks.

00:19:39.370 --> 00:19:42.130
Many how-to books in general are
written to be convenient

00:19:42.130 --> 00:19:44.020
for the author to write,
not a logical

00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:46.970
progression for the reader.

00:19:46.970 --> 00:19:48.600
So why do people quit cooking?

00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:53.010
Let's say, knife skills, a
really, really common reason

00:19:53.010 --> 00:19:53.590
for people quitting.

00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:53.880
Why?

00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:55.550
Because they're introduced
too early.

00:19:55.550 --> 00:19:58.790
So there are ways to postpone it
at a point when the student

00:19:58.790 --> 00:20:00.440
will be ready.

00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:03.250
Additionally, I don't care
about why people pick

00:20:03.250 --> 00:20:03.795
cookbooks up.

00:20:03.795 --> 00:20:05.990
I care about why they
put them down.

00:20:05.990 --> 00:20:09.030
And what I did right from the
outset before even starting

00:20:09.030 --> 00:20:11.520
writing is I polled my Facebook
and Twitter followers

00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:13.370
to identify the five
or six most common

00:20:13.370 --> 00:20:15.090
reasons people quit.

00:20:15.090 --> 00:20:16.340
So what do we have?

00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:19.120
Shopping, too much
cleanup, too much

00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:21.050
expensive gear, et cetera.

00:20:21.050 --> 00:20:25.380
And it's very important when
you're trying to lose fat or

00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:27.520
whether you're trying to learn
something quickly to only

00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:29.610
adopt one new behavior
at a time.

00:20:29.610 --> 00:20:32.210
So if you guys take anything
away from this, let it be,

00:20:32.210 --> 00:20:33.240
well, first, 80/20.

00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:35.430
And then secondly, one
behavior at a time.

00:20:35.430 --> 00:20:37.765
So if you look at, let's say,
the research that BJ Fogg has

00:20:37.765 --> 00:20:40.140
done the persuasion
lab at Stanford--

00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:41.010
or really anywhere else.

00:20:41.010 --> 00:20:43.545
If you try to take, for
instance, people who are over

00:20:43.545 --> 00:20:46.540
the age of 50 and teach them
to quit smoking by texting,

00:20:46.540 --> 00:20:48.160
your failure rate's going
to be sky high.

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:50.300
Because you're trying to teach
them two new habits, texting

00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:52.310
and quitting smoking.

00:20:52.310 --> 00:20:53.640
Yay.

00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:57.150
When most people try to learn
to cook, what are

00:20:57.150 --> 00:20:58.942
they in fact doing?

00:20:58.942 --> 00:20:59.730
Just ignore this.

00:20:59.730 --> 00:21:01.020
Ignore this.

00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:04.230
They're not trying to adopt
one new behavior.

00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:06.180
They're trying to adopt
grocery shopping.

00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:07.640
And of course they don't know
where anything is, because

00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:08.890
they never do it, so it
takes them an hour

00:21:08.890 --> 00:21:10.030
longer than it should.

00:21:10.030 --> 00:21:11.570
Then prep time.

00:21:11.570 --> 00:21:14.070
Pain in the ass, especially if
you don't know knife skills.

00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:15.580
Then cooking, then cleanup.

00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:17.400
Of course everybody gives up.

00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:17.910
Of course.

00:21:17.910 --> 00:21:20.230
That's like I've never
lost weight before.

00:21:20.230 --> 00:21:20.680
I want to lose weight.

00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:20.830
Great.

00:21:20.830 --> 00:21:22.280
I'm going to go to the gym
seven times a week.

00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:24.060
I'm going to change
all my meals.

00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:25.210
I'm going to get the most
expensive personal

00:21:25.210 --> 00:21:26.110
trainer I can find.

00:21:26.110 --> 00:21:28.130
And then add two more to that.

00:21:28.130 --> 00:21:29.390
Of course it fails.

00:21:29.390 --> 00:21:31.740
So a side note-- if you want to
lose fat quickly, 30 grams

00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:33.910
within 30 minutes of waking
up is the first

00:21:33.910 --> 00:21:34.540
change you should make.

00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:35.740
That's how my dad started.

00:21:35.740 --> 00:21:38.340
He went from 5 pounds of average
fat loss per month to

00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:41.210
17.85 in the first month and
then lost a total of

00:21:41.210 --> 00:21:42.660
more than 90 pounds.

00:21:42.660 --> 00:21:44.630
So just a protein shake first
thing when you wake up.

00:21:44.630 --> 00:21:46.980
Don't even change your meals.

00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:48.740
If you have a lot of weight to
lose, don't exercise for the

00:21:48.740 --> 00:21:51.640
first 8 to 12 weeks.

00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:52.880
The grammar of any language--

00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:56.970
this is the 80/20 of
language learning.

00:21:56.970 --> 00:21:57.990
There's a fascinating guy--

00:21:57.990 --> 00:22:01.890
I talk about him briefly
in "The 4-Hour Chef"--

00:22:01.890 --> 00:22:04.230
named Cardinal Mezzofanti.

00:22:04.230 --> 00:22:05.540
Anyone heard this name before?

00:22:05.540 --> 00:22:06.030
All right.

00:22:06.030 --> 00:22:10.470
So Cardinal Mezzofanti
is a hyperpolyglot.

00:22:10.470 --> 00:22:12.790
By some accounts, he
spoke 72 languages.

00:22:12.790 --> 00:22:15.830
He's been tested pretty
well in at least 32.

00:22:15.830 --> 00:22:17.690
There's actually a book about
a lot of this stuff called

00:22:17.690 --> 00:22:21.280
"Babel No More," I believe it
is, which is outstanding.

00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:25.160
The way that he learned these
languages without using really

00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:28.090
any written materials to speak
of was he would have native

00:22:28.090 --> 00:22:30.320
speakers translate the
Lord's Prayer into

00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:32.240
their native language.

00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:35.290
And in that tiny little Lord's
Prayer, he could pick out

00:22:35.290 --> 00:22:36.970
almost all of the most
important grammatical

00:22:36.970 --> 00:22:39.080
constructions in the
entire language.

00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:40.410
I actually ended up
doing the same

00:22:40.410 --> 00:22:43.960
thing, but with 13 sentences.

00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:47.140
So in effect, just to make
language, because it's so

00:22:47.140 --> 00:22:49.970
intimidating to people,
graspable--

00:22:49.970 --> 00:22:53.190
if you can translate these 13
sentences, you have enough

00:22:53.190 --> 00:22:58.720
grammar to have a pretty long
conversation assuming that you

00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:00.280
then add in the words
you need.

00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:02.350
And if you study something
called the linkword mnemonic--

00:23:02.350 --> 00:23:04.110
there are different types of
mnemonics-- the linkword

00:23:04.110 --> 00:23:07.750
mnemonic by Gruneberg,
G-R-U-N-E-B-E-R-G, you can

00:23:07.750 --> 00:23:10.550
learn 200 to 300 words a day
without too much trouble.

00:23:10.550 --> 00:23:12.780
And if you consider you need
about 1,200 words to seem

00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:16.110
fluent, like a week or two,
you're off to the races.

00:23:16.110 --> 00:23:19.060
I'm not kidding.

00:23:19.060 --> 00:23:22.540
This is my Muppet face, as
my girlfriend calls it.

00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:27.690
And this is to illustrate the
minimal effective dose in

00:23:27.690 --> 00:23:28.330
terms of gear.

00:23:28.330 --> 00:23:30.140
So one of the things that I
always found very frustrating

00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:32.150
about cooking, they'd be like,
OK, you ready, excited?

00:23:32.150 --> 00:23:32.940
You're enthusiastic?

00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:35.310
Let's kill that enthusiasm,
because you have to buy $4,000

00:23:35.310 --> 00:23:36.740
worth of stuff.

00:23:36.740 --> 00:23:38.390
And you don't even know if
you're going to keep cooking.

00:23:38.390 --> 00:23:40.160
But have fun spending
that money.

00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:42.330
And that's like, oh, you
want to try cycling?

00:23:42.330 --> 00:23:44.870
Here, buy this $4,000
Tour de France--

00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:46.250
it just makes no sense.

00:23:46.250 --> 00:23:50.010
So if you look at a few of the
things I have here, this is

00:23:50.010 --> 00:23:52.440
about all you need to
cook really well.

00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:55.750
For part of the research, I went
to the Oberoi Grand in

00:23:55.750 --> 00:23:56.330
Kolkata, India.

00:23:56.330 --> 00:23:58.650
And that was one of the best
chefs in the country.

00:23:58.650 --> 00:24:02.670
He did all of his prep with a
$20 Victorinox knife and two

00:24:02.670 --> 00:24:03.690
stainless steel pans.

00:24:03.690 --> 00:24:07.560
You could buy all of that
for $35, $40 in the US.

00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:10.310
Here you have a microplane
on the left-hand side.

00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:14.060
You have the Rada Cutlery
cleaver, which is a $9 to $12

00:24:14.060 --> 00:24:15.950
knife which is perfect for
learning knife skills.

00:24:15.950 --> 00:24:18.710
Do not spend a fortune on knives
until you've decided

00:24:18.710 --> 00:24:20.310
you're actually going
to continue cooking.

00:24:20.310 --> 00:24:22.995
Then you have that blue towel,
which I found through Tom

00:24:22.995 --> 00:24:24.180
Colicchio's gang.

00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:26.460
That is a surgical, lint-free
huck towel.

00:24:26.460 --> 00:24:27.950
It's not designed for cooking.

00:24:27.950 --> 00:24:29.680
It's designed for hospitals.

00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:30.990
They're about $1 apiece.

00:24:30.990 --> 00:24:31.500
They are gold.

00:24:31.500 --> 00:24:33.260
They can be used for a million
different things.

00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:35.710
Then you see that little
vegetable peeler.

00:24:35.710 --> 00:24:37.590
That is a Kuhn Rikon
vegetable peeler.

00:24:37.590 --> 00:24:39.510
The Star peeler was the
original version.

00:24:39.510 --> 00:24:42.240
A guy named Joe Ades sold
millions of them in Union

00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:43.330
Square in New York City.

00:24:43.330 --> 00:24:44.760
Find videos of him online.

00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:45.700
It's amazing.

00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:47.490
Then a couple of silicon
spatulas.

00:24:47.490 --> 00:24:51.190
A probe thermometer,
super critical.

00:24:51.190 --> 00:24:53.390
If you never want to undercook
or overcook food ever again,

00:24:53.390 --> 00:24:54.730
just get a probe thermometer.

00:24:54.730 --> 00:24:56.790
When in doubt, cook it to
140 and you're fine.

00:24:56.790 --> 00:24:58.260
There are a couple
of exceptions.

00:24:58.260 --> 00:25:01.580
Then a Peltex, which is like
a slotted fish spatula.

00:25:01.580 --> 00:25:03.550
And then a cast-iron
Dutch oven.

00:25:03.550 --> 00:25:04.820
That's pretty much
all you need.

00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:06.510
And you could start
with a lot less.

00:25:06.510 --> 00:25:08.140
On the right-hand side--

00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:09.690
any coffee geeks?

00:25:09.690 --> 00:25:11.080
There's got be at least
one or two.

00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:12.410
All right.

00:25:12.410 --> 00:25:16.290
So I spent a few days with
Stephen Morrissey, who was the

00:25:16.290 --> 00:25:20.000
2008 World Barista Champion,
works at Intelligentsia Coffee

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:24.220
now, also helped design the
coffee program at Eleven

00:25:24.220 --> 00:25:27.700
Madison Park, which has become a
big selling point for Eleven

00:25:27.700 --> 00:25:28.610
Madison Park.

00:25:28.610 --> 00:25:31.050
So here are some of the
things we tested.

00:25:31.050 --> 00:25:32.010
I'm not going to go
through each one.

00:25:32.010 --> 00:25:34.310
But if you want to make a really
amazing cup of coffee

00:25:34.310 --> 00:25:37.820
and you don't want to get too
down, stuck in the weeds,

00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:38.770
here's my recommendation.

00:25:38.770 --> 00:25:41.210
For one or two people, all
you need is an AeroPress.

00:25:41.210 --> 00:25:43.260
It was designed by a mechanical
engineer out of

00:25:43.260 --> 00:25:46.050
Stanford who also developed the
Aerobie, the Aerobie, that

00:25:46.050 --> 00:25:47.610
Frisbee, same guy.

00:25:47.610 --> 00:25:48.790
AeroPress.

00:25:48.790 --> 00:25:50.290
And then get, obviously,
good coffee.

00:25:50.290 --> 00:25:52.570
Get a conical burr grinder,
which does

00:25:52.570 --> 00:25:53.430
not have to be expensive.

00:25:53.430 --> 00:25:55.280
You could get a Hario hand
grinder or a Porlex.

00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:57.850
They're probably $20,
$30 a piece.

00:25:57.850 --> 00:26:01.340
And then 12 grams of freshly
ground coffee to

00:26:01.340 --> 00:26:03.180
200 grams of water.

00:26:03.180 --> 00:26:08.120
And the water should be between
175 and 180 degrees

00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:09.040
Fahrenheit.

00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:09.610
And you're done.

00:26:09.610 --> 00:26:11.390
That's all you need to
know for the basics.

00:26:11.390 --> 00:26:13.720
You can get in the weeds, but
that will produce one of the

00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:15.230
best cups of coffee you've
ever had in your life.

00:26:18.230 --> 00:26:18.830
Anti-Griddle--

00:26:18.830 --> 00:26:21.810
this is just a point I want
to make about home versus

00:26:21.810 --> 00:26:23.070
professional chef.

00:26:23.070 --> 00:26:26.090
Professional chefs need fancy
gear in some cases, because

00:26:26.090 --> 00:26:29.550
they have to produce 100, 200,
300 of the same dish a night.

00:26:29.550 --> 00:26:32.120
And they have to be extremely
consistent.

00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:35.700
At home, you can create the
same thing but use a

00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:38.250
super-ghetto MacGyver
approach.

00:26:38.250 --> 00:26:40.090
So there's something called
the Anti-Griddle, which is

00:26:40.090 --> 00:26:42.360
manufactured by a company
called PolyScience.

00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:44.410
And it's used at Alinea.

00:26:44.410 --> 00:26:47.040
It's a surface that can be
lowered to about negative 40

00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:48.070
Fahrenheit.

00:26:48.070 --> 00:26:50.480
And you can make all sorts
of crazy stuff.

00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:52.520
The way they did the recipe
testing before the

00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:54.740
Anti-Griddle existed, and the
way that you can replicate the

00:26:54.740 --> 00:26:57.530
results at home without spending
$2,000, is using a

00:26:57.530 --> 00:26:59.550
block of dry ice and a
baking sheet on top.

00:26:59.550 --> 00:27:01.160
Or you could use the back
of a metal spatula.

00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:02.810
And then you can make these
things, for instance.

00:27:02.810 --> 00:27:03.880
Take a few minutes.

00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:08.880
These are like those peppermint
Girl Scout cookies,

00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:11.560
those super crack
addict cookies.

00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:13.720
They're like that, but
even more addictive.

00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:14.890
And you can make them in
about five minutes.

00:27:14.890 --> 00:27:17.120
But you can do this at home
and replicate a lot of the

00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:19.400
things that would cost
$5,000 to $10,000

00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:21.820
with just a few dollars.

00:27:21.820 --> 00:27:24.900
This is one of the last points
I'm going to make.

00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:27.570
And that is the approach
is the same.

00:27:27.570 --> 00:27:30.690
This process, this
blueprint for

00:27:30.690 --> 00:27:32.740
meta-learning, applies to tango.

00:27:32.740 --> 00:27:36.510
That was my instructor for a
whole host of reasons in

00:27:36.510 --> 00:27:39.670
Argentina when I was
competing, named--

00:27:39.670 --> 00:27:42.780
not the woman, although that
would've been nice.

00:27:42.780 --> 00:27:45.320
Gabriel Misse, on the left-hand
side, Gabriel Misse,

00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:49.340
M-I-S-S-E. If you ever want to
go to Argentina or take tango

00:27:49.340 --> 00:27:50.990
classes, look for that guy.

00:27:50.990 --> 00:27:54.080
He's one of the few tango
instructors whom the old

00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:56.460
guard, like the old-school
milongueros, really love, as

00:27:56.460 --> 00:27:58.130
well as the new guard,
like [SPANISH]

00:27:58.130 --> 00:28:00.120
guys, they all love him.

00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:01.630
Here's me, on the floor.

00:28:01.630 --> 00:28:02.340
What am I doing?

00:28:02.340 --> 00:28:07.370
I'm practicing the motion of
sauteing, on my knees with dry

00:28:07.370 --> 00:28:08.130
beans in a skillet.

00:28:08.130 --> 00:28:09.640
I'm not cooking.

00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:12.460
The most stressful way to learn
new skills is to try to

00:28:12.460 --> 00:28:15.040
learn them while you're under
pressure to produce a meal.

00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:17.800
So this is an example of
no-stakes practice.

00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:20.550
Like practicing cutting skills
with a lettuce knife, for

00:28:20.550 --> 00:28:23.250
instance, which is pretty much
exactly the same shape as a

00:28:23.250 --> 00:28:25.840
chef's knife, but you
can't cut yourself.

00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:27.230
On the right-hand side here,
if we want to talk

00:28:27.230 --> 00:28:27.990
about guns, we can.

00:28:27.990 --> 00:28:29.670
But I'm not going
to go too nuts.

00:28:29.670 --> 00:28:32.940
This is an M&amp;P .45,
Smith &amp; Wesson.

00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:33.840
That is the real gun.

00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:36.590
Then above it, we have a pellet
gun and a BB gun, both

00:28:36.590 --> 00:28:38.440
manufactured by Smith &amp; Wesson,
that are replicas of

00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:41.930
the same thing, which allowed
me to practice at home so I

00:28:41.930 --> 00:28:43.960
could then transfer all
those results to

00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:46.030
the range, or zombies.

00:28:46.030 --> 00:28:50.020
So no-stakes practice
and transfer--

00:28:50.020 --> 00:28:52.840
the process is the same
for all these skills.

00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:56.680
And of course, last but
not least, simplify.

00:28:56.680 --> 00:28:58.380
Learning does not have
to be complicated.

00:28:58.380 --> 00:28:59.600
Cooking does not have
to be complicated.

00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:01.080
And what I noticed--

00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:03.920
I mentioned this earlier-- is
at the very highest levels,

00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:07.570
when I met the best of the best,
they kept things really

00:29:07.570 --> 00:29:08.480
simple for me.

00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:09.770
They didn't say, no,
you can't do it.

00:29:09.770 --> 00:29:11.250
They didn't say, no, it'll
take a lifetime to

00:29:11.250 --> 00:29:12.150
become a good cook.

00:29:12.150 --> 00:29:12.560
They said, look.

00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:14.500
If you want to dedicate your
life to it, you have

00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:15.690
to do what I do.

00:29:15.690 --> 00:29:17.990
But to be one of the most
amazing home cooks out there

00:29:17.990 --> 00:29:19.570
does not take very
much time at all.

00:29:19.570 --> 00:29:21.480
It does not have to
be complicated.

00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:24.620
That is a Gurkha regiment kukri
knife, for those people

00:29:24.620 --> 00:29:26.040
wondering, a Nepalese
knife used to chop

00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:27.580
people's heads off.

00:29:27.580 --> 00:29:30.230
That is related to
simplification because the act

00:29:30.230 --> 00:29:32.530
of deciding to simplify--

00:29:32.530 --> 00:29:34.350
decision is related
to incision.

00:29:34.350 --> 00:29:37.010
Decision is removing
possibilities, applying

00:29:37.010 --> 00:29:40.340
positive constraints, like
the 80/20 analysis.

00:29:40.340 --> 00:29:45.640
So I'll end with one example
of simplicity.

00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:47.150
This is an ash cake.

00:29:47.150 --> 00:29:48.670
So these are cakes.

00:29:48.670 --> 00:29:52.170
They're like scones made from
acorn flour, cooked directly

00:29:52.170 --> 00:29:53.950
on a bed of coals.

00:29:53.950 --> 00:29:56.190
And this was done in the Santa
Cruz mountains, with an

00:29:56.190 --> 00:29:58.200
incredible guy named Cliff
Hodges, who actually has

00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:00.460
engineering degrees from MIT,
but runs a company called

00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:02.130
Adventure Out in Santa Cruz.

00:30:02.130 --> 00:30:04.270
You guys should all
check it out.

00:30:04.270 --> 00:30:06.585
Made these, brush off
some of the ash.

00:30:06.585 --> 00:30:08.920
The most delicious scones
I'd had in years.

00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:12.000
And it was done right on a bed
of coals in the mountains.

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:15.470
So find the elegance in the
chaos and simplify to the

00:30:15.470 --> 00:30:16.900
extent possible.

00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:20.040
And that is the end of
my presentation.

00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:20.580
Thank you.

00:30:20.580 --> 00:30:26.650
[APPLAUSE]

00:30:26.650 --> 00:30:28.590
TIMOTHY FERRISS: So I would love
to do Q&amp;A. That's when I

00:30:28.590 --> 00:30:29.190
have the most fun.

00:30:29.190 --> 00:30:30.680
So the mic is right over here.

00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:34.770
If anyone has any questions,
I would love to hear them.

00:30:34.770 --> 00:30:36.170
And they don't have to be
related to anything in this

00:30:36.170 --> 00:30:37.420
presentation.

00:30:41.630 --> 00:30:41.930
Yeah.

00:30:41.930 --> 00:30:43.330
I think we're just going to
[? have this ?] because they

00:30:43.330 --> 00:30:45.000
want to record the questions.

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:52.430
AUDIENCE: Have you applied
the DSSS thing to coding?

00:30:52.430 --> 00:30:56.440
And if so, what do you start
with in terms of sequencing?

00:30:56.440 --> 00:30:59.510
TIMOTHY FERRISS: I have not
spent a lot of time tackling

00:30:59.510 --> 00:31:03.110
coding, just because I've spent
most of my time in the

00:31:03.110 --> 00:31:03.930
natural languages.

00:31:03.930 --> 00:31:08.370
But I did have a very
fun experience with

00:31:08.370 --> 00:31:11.100
Chad Fowler, who--

00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:13.410
I guess it was RailsConf, among
other things, that he

00:31:13.410 --> 00:31:14.440
used to run--

00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:20.130
where he taught me the basics
of Ruby using analogies from

00:31:20.130 --> 00:31:22.210
Hindi, which he speaks.

00:31:22.210 --> 00:31:27.060
And the way I would start
is by looking at--

00:31:27.060 --> 00:31:30.200
from the deconstruction step,
I would look for people who

00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:33.370
have had the fastest rate
of progress in a

00:31:33.370 --> 00:31:34.650
short period of time.

00:31:34.650 --> 00:31:37.260
So rather than trying to emulate
the best coders--

00:31:37.260 --> 00:31:40.430
so for instance, I remember once
I asked a friend of mine,

00:31:40.430 --> 00:31:41.030
Daniel Burka--

00:31:41.030 --> 00:31:42.280
I think he's here right
now, in fact--

00:31:44.870 --> 00:31:46.250
about the basics of CSS.

00:31:46.250 --> 00:31:48.960
And he's like, all this stuff
is second nature to me.

00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:51.700
I don't remember the problems
that I had in the beginning.

00:31:51.700 --> 00:31:53.780
So looking for people, let's say
in the world of swimming,

00:31:53.780 --> 00:31:55.570
instead of Michael Phelps, you'd
look at someone like

00:31:55.570 --> 00:31:57.580
Shinji Takeuchi.

00:31:57.580 --> 00:32:00.540
But in coding, I would be
looking for people who have

00:32:00.540 --> 00:32:02.890
made tremendous progress in
a short period of time.

00:32:02.890 --> 00:32:04.740
And that could be by contacting
someone like Code

00:32:04.740 --> 00:32:07.020
Academy and asking them
for case studies.

00:32:07.020 --> 00:32:07.870
There are a number of different

00:32:07.870 --> 00:32:08.430
approaches I could take.

00:32:08.430 --> 00:32:11.050
But I haven't delved too deeply
into programming.

00:32:11.050 --> 00:32:14.360
The reason this book took me so
long to write partially is

00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:16.410
I didn't have the contacts and
resources that I have now to

00:32:16.410 --> 00:32:18.060
meet the people I
wanted to meet.

00:32:18.060 --> 00:32:21.740
But it's also because I'd tried
other frameworks that

00:32:21.740 --> 00:32:23.900
always fell through with
different subjects.

00:32:23.900 --> 00:32:26.000
And this is the only one that
has held up so far.

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:27.880
So I think it could apply.

00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:31.020
AUDIENCE: So in short, find
someone that's an expert at it

00:32:31.020 --> 00:32:34.820
and kind of ask them what
the end sequence--

00:32:34.820 --> 00:32:36.400
TIMOTHY FERRISS:
Or model them.

00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:40.150
There's a list of 10 to
15 questions in the

00:32:40.150 --> 00:32:42.800
Deconstruction section that I
recommend running through,

00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:45.280
whether as a thought exercise in
using Google, let's say to

00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:48.680
just do searches, which can
really be all you need, or

00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:50.580
whether you're actually
reaching out

00:32:50.580 --> 00:32:51.860
to people in person.

00:32:51.860 --> 00:32:54.800
That list of questions helps
break down where the

00:32:54.800 --> 00:32:58.130
Archimedes levers might be where
you can accelerate your

00:32:58.130 --> 00:33:00.070
progress compared
to, let's say, a

00:33:00.070 --> 00:33:02.282
conventional CS training.

00:33:02.282 --> 00:33:03.532
Yeah?

00:33:05.690 --> 00:33:06.270
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:33:06.270 --> 00:33:10.305
So your book is self-published
on Amazon, right, and not in

00:33:10.305 --> 00:33:11.160
bookstores?

00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:14.230
TIMOTHY FERRISS: It is the
first major book through

00:33:14.230 --> 00:33:15.190
Amazon Publishing.

00:33:15.190 --> 00:33:17.110
So it's not self-published.

00:33:17.110 --> 00:33:18.640
This is a confusing aspect
of it because

00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:19.650
Amazon has so many options.

00:33:19.650 --> 00:33:22.080
Amazon Publishing is based in
New York and competes directly

00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:23.940
with all of the other
major publishers.

00:33:23.940 --> 00:33:26.640
So they sign authors and provide
advances and do all of

00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:29.940
that stuff, which is why there's
been such a strong

00:33:29.940 --> 00:33:31.890
response, positive
and negative.

00:33:31.890 --> 00:33:34.480
So it's being boycotted at
retail by all of Barnes &amp;

00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:36.780
Noble and a lot of indies.

00:33:36.780 --> 00:33:41.700
But there are some stores, like
Hastings and a handful of

00:33:41.700 --> 00:33:44.476
indies throughout the country,
that do carry it.

00:33:44.476 --> 00:33:45.340
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:33:45.340 --> 00:33:48.131
And so what were your business
decisions for that?

00:33:48.131 --> 00:33:52.530
TIMOTHY FERRISS: The business
decisions were for me that I

00:33:52.530 --> 00:33:53.570
like experimenting.

00:33:53.570 --> 00:33:55.050
I mean, I'm sort of an
experimentalist.

00:33:55.050 --> 00:33:57.880
And I'd done the traditional
model twice.

00:33:57.880 --> 00:33:59.210
I know what's involved.

00:33:59.210 --> 00:34:00.980
I know how to do it well.

00:34:00.980 --> 00:34:03.030
It's just not very interesting
anymore.

00:34:03.030 --> 00:34:05.020
And I wanted to try
something new.

00:34:05.020 --> 00:34:09.139
And Amazon has direct access
to all of its customers.

00:34:09.139 --> 00:34:11.330
When you think of traditional
publishing,

00:34:11.330 --> 00:34:12.335
they are B2B companies.

00:34:12.335 --> 00:34:14.330
So you'll have the
VP of sales at an

00:34:14.330 --> 00:34:15.810
imprint of Simon &amp; Schuster.

00:34:15.810 --> 00:34:18.030
They sell to the head category
buyer at Barnes &amp; Noble or

00:34:18.030 --> 00:34:18.929
Books-A-Million.

00:34:18.929 --> 00:34:19.960
They do not have any
relationship

00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:21.040
with their end users.

00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:26.080
And I wanted to see what could
be done through Amazon, given

00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:28.699
that it's a completely new
landscape, and just try

00:34:28.699 --> 00:34:29.249
something different.

00:34:29.249 --> 00:34:32.730
So we'll find out very shortly
the results of that.

00:34:32.730 --> 00:34:33.429
But it's been fun.

00:34:33.429 --> 00:34:35.989
I mean, it's allowed me to do
things very aggressively that

00:34:35.989 --> 00:34:38.219
I otherwise probably would not
have even thought to do, like

00:34:38.219 --> 00:34:41.590
partnering with BitTorrent to
provide hundreds of megabytes

00:34:41.590 --> 00:34:44.429
of extra content and
video and whatnot.

00:34:44.429 --> 00:34:45.770
It's forced me to improvise.

00:34:45.770 --> 00:34:49.290
And I just enjoy that.

00:34:49.290 --> 00:34:51.780
That's kind of what
gets me excited.

00:34:51.780 --> 00:34:53.191
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:34:53.191 --> 00:34:55.100
TIMOTHY FERRISS: Thank you.

00:34:55.100 --> 00:34:56.840
AUDIENCE: So one of my favorite
things about your

00:34:56.840 --> 00:34:59.840
other books are that you find
these universally accepted

00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:02.030
truths, and you affirm some
of them and negate others.

00:35:02.030 --> 00:35:04.690
So in "The 4-Hour Body," you
kind of negated the idea that

00:35:04.690 --> 00:35:06.470
calories in equals
calorie out.

00:35:06.470 --> 00:35:09.500
But you affirmed the idea that
a high protein intake's

00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:11.190
important to muscle growth.

00:35:11.190 --> 00:35:13.550
During this book, what are some
of your favorite truths

00:35:13.550 --> 00:35:15.210
that you found that
you affirmed and

00:35:15.210 --> 00:35:16.625
some that you negated?

00:35:16.625 --> 00:35:17.600
TIMOTHY FERRISS: That's
a good question.

00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:18.690
I want to talk about
the calories in,

00:35:18.690 --> 00:35:20.090
calories out for a second.

00:35:20.090 --> 00:35:22.970
So even in "The 4-Hour Body"
when I ate whatever it was,

00:35:22.970 --> 00:35:25.280
like 7,000 calories in
12 hours, people were

00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:27.410
like, ah, that's BS.

00:35:27.410 --> 00:35:29.520
So I wanted to do that
again in this book.

00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:31.040
So just two quick examples.

00:35:31.040 --> 00:35:34.980
One was I connected with some
competitive eaters, like the

00:35:34.980 --> 00:35:37.590
number two ranked guy in the
world and a few others, and

00:35:37.590 --> 00:35:40.360
had a Vermonster-eating
competition with a

00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:40.940
bodybuilder.

00:35:40.940 --> 00:35:42.740
So the Vermonster is this thing
from Ben &amp; Jerry's.

00:35:42.740 --> 00:35:46.410
It's 14,000 calories, 500
grams of fat, ice cream,

00:35:46.410 --> 00:35:49.010
bananas, brownies, cookies.

00:35:49.010 --> 00:35:54.010
It's just beyond
beyond excess.

00:35:54.010 --> 00:35:58.590
And so we ate that in
20 minutes or so.

00:35:58.590 --> 00:36:01.750
And so I did that first.

00:36:01.750 --> 00:36:04.506
And then the very next day--

00:36:04.506 --> 00:36:07.140
oh, and the competition was to
see who could finish it the

00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:10.100
fastest and who could gain the
most weight simultaneously.

00:36:10.100 --> 00:36:11.930
The next day I did--

00:36:11.930 --> 00:36:13.950
and I measured my body fat
beforehand, with an ultrasound

00:36:13.950 --> 00:36:15.910
analyzer that the Yankees use.

00:36:15.910 --> 00:36:18.550
The next day, I did a New
York City food marathon.

00:36:18.550 --> 00:36:22.540
So I wanted to try this idea of
a food marathon, which was

00:36:22.540 --> 00:36:24.790
26.2 iconic dishes.

00:36:24.790 --> 00:36:25.960
The 0.2 is cookies.

00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:27.920
26.2 iconic dishes--

00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:28.670
I like cookies--

00:36:28.670 --> 00:36:33.220
in 26 locations in 24
hours, all walked.

00:36:33.220 --> 00:36:34.310
And so I did both of those.

00:36:34.310 --> 00:36:36.380
That was probably another 12,000
to 15,000 calories.

00:36:36.380 --> 00:36:39.180
And then I had lower body fat
the next day, using all the

00:36:39.180 --> 00:36:41.210
stuff in "The 4-Hour
Body," like the

00:36:41.210 --> 00:36:41.940
alpha lipoic acid [? one. ?]

00:36:41.940 --> 00:36:45.610
Some of the things that were
fascinating to look at in this

00:36:45.610 --> 00:36:51.340
book, things that were maybe
refuted or shown to be not

00:36:51.340 --> 00:36:53.630
complete, shown to be
incomplete-- like searing a

00:36:53.630 --> 00:36:56.480
steak, for instance.

00:36:56.480 --> 00:37:00.050
If you want the perfect sear on
a steak, you're producing

00:37:00.050 --> 00:37:01.130
this Maillard reaction.

00:37:01.130 --> 00:37:04.290
And part of what you need for
that is low moisture.

00:37:04.290 --> 00:37:06.640
And what you usually hear is,
OK, you get the steak to room

00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:07.790
temperature.

00:37:07.790 --> 00:37:10.230
Then you sear it and cook
it and whatnot.

00:37:10.230 --> 00:37:13.750
Well, one of the best ways to
get that perfect sear is

00:37:13.750 --> 00:37:16.600
actually to put the steak
uncovered in the freezer for

00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:18.300
45 minutes.

00:37:18.300 --> 00:37:20.250
Because it's the driest
environment that you have in

00:37:20.250 --> 00:37:20.720
your house.

00:37:20.720 --> 00:37:21.400
It's like Antarctica.

00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:23.930
So it will evaporate all the
surface moisture content.

00:37:23.930 --> 00:37:25.040
Then you sear it.

00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:27.360
And then you put it in the oven
at 200 degrees and just

00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:29.890
let it rock until you
hit 135 degrees.

00:37:29.890 --> 00:37:31.620
And you'll have the best steak
you've ever had in your life.

00:37:31.620 --> 00:37:32.520
It's amazing.

00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:36.790
So just different ways of
sequencing things like that.

00:37:36.790 --> 00:37:39.780
In the world of learning,
there's so many myths, and

00:37:39.780 --> 00:37:42.620
partially because those myths
are very profitable to

00:37:42.620 --> 00:37:43.720
commercialize.

00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:47.920
So the idea that children learn
languages faster than

00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:49.960
adults so you should
mimic how children

00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:51.210
learn language is nonsense.

00:37:51.210 --> 00:37:55.160
Like, have you talked to a
three-year-old recently?

00:37:55.160 --> 00:37:58.154
They have a lot of work to do.

00:37:58.154 --> 00:37:59.400
I'm sorry, kid.

00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:00.050
Not good enough.

00:38:00.050 --> 00:38:03.910
So the idea that someone who
already has an L1 native

00:38:03.910 --> 00:38:06.640
language needs to learn the
way a baby learns is

00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:07.520
ridiculous.

00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:11.260
And you could use 8 to 12 weeks,
but there are companies

00:38:11.260 --> 00:38:13.360
like Rosetta Stone that
capitalize on the fact that

00:38:13.360 --> 00:38:14.450
it's perceived as complex.

00:38:14.450 --> 00:38:16.280
So it's like, oh, you
think it's complex?

00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:17.290
Great.

00:38:17.290 --> 00:38:20.000
We have three or four sets that
cost $200, $300, $400

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:23.180
apiece that we can sell you.

00:38:23.180 --> 00:38:24.620
In learning, there are
so many myths.

00:38:24.620 --> 00:38:31.270
In cooking, I would say some
of the myths relate to--

00:38:31.270 --> 00:38:33.830
not even myths, but just gaps.

00:38:33.830 --> 00:38:37.870
I have never seen a systematic
way of learning flavors like

00:38:37.870 --> 00:38:39.370
you might learn foreign
vocabulary.

00:38:39.370 --> 00:38:40.180
I've never seen it.

00:38:40.180 --> 00:38:41.590
I tried to find it.

00:38:41.590 --> 00:38:44.780
So it's like how do you actually
learn to be able to

00:38:44.780 --> 00:38:48.260
recall and identify flavor
is really, really tricky.

00:38:48.260 --> 00:38:51.810
So I reached out to this group
of researchers at--

00:38:51.810 --> 00:38:54.760
I think it's the Monell Sensory
Research Institute.

00:38:54.760 --> 00:38:57.130
And they pointed out
a few things to me.

00:38:57.130 --> 00:38:58.830
For instance, there are not only
taste receptors in the

00:38:58.830 --> 00:39:01.390
mouth but in the throat,
in the stomach, even

00:39:01.390 --> 00:39:02.990
in the small intestine.

00:39:02.990 --> 00:39:05.900
And there were a few flavors
like cloves, for whatever

00:39:05.900 --> 00:39:09.210
reason, that I couldn't peg.

00:39:09.210 --> 00:39:11.140
I just couldn't remember them.

00:39:11.140 --> 00:39:12.310
Basil was another.

00:39:12.310 --> 00:39:15.380
So what I ended up doing was
crushing them, steeping them

00:39:15.380 --> 00:39:18.910
like tea, drinking it like a
wine snob and aerating it and

00:39:18.910 --> 00:39:20.180
all that, and then
swallowing it.

00:39:20.180 --> 00:39:22.770
And as soon as I used all of
these taste receptors, it was

00:39:22.770 --> 00:39:24.150
just like [SNAP]

00:39:24.150 --> 00:39:25.910
done.

00:39:25.910 --> 00:39:27.480
Those would be a few
that come to mind.

00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:27.950
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:39:27.950 --> 00:39:29.200
TIMOTHY FERRISS: Yeah, thanks.

00:39:32.770 --> 00:39:35.180
AUDIENCE: I've heard
you on podcasts and

00:39:35.180 --> 00:39:37.740
YouTube things as guests.

00:39:37.740 --> 00:39:39.870
Do you have any plans or have
you ever thought about doing

00:39:39.870 --> 00:39:43.706
your own podcast or YouTube
channel or anything?

00:39:43.706 --> 00:39:44.070
TIMOTHY FERRISS: Yeah.

00:39:44.070 --> 00:39:47.930
I've thought about podcasts
instead of a YouTube channel.

00:39:47.930 --> 00:39:48.980
I've thought about it.

00:39:48.980 --> 00:39:52.870
But I'm very wary of creating a
monster that I have to feed.

00:39:52.870 --> 00:39:55.430
If I enjoy it, like, oh, this
is awesome, every week or

00:39:55.430 --> 00:39:58.710
every day doing a podcast,
having amazing guests, I think

00:39:58.710 --> 00:40:02.000
it would be fun until I decided
that I wanted to take

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:05.050
a break and then had to perhaps
face the backlash.

00:40:05.050 --> 00:40:07.580
But I really enjoy Joe
Rogan Podcast.

00:40:07.580 --> 00:40:09.740
I've been on The Joe Rogan
Podcast twice,

00:40:09.740 --> 00:40:11.590
three hours each time.

00:40:11.590 --> 00:40:13.500
And it just gives you--
it doesn't have to

00:40:13.500 --> 00:40:14.170
be three hours long.

00:40:14.170 --> 00:40:16.050
But it gives you an opportunity
to reach a depth

00:40:16.050 --> 00:40:18.710
of discussion that you just
can't do if it's three minutes

00:40:18.710 --> 00:40:20.320
on "The Today Show."

00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:21.800
So I have thought about
the podcast.

00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:24.080
I've thought about the podcast a
lot, especially because this

00:40:24.080 --> 00:40:26.390
silly thing that Kevin Rose and
I have done for a couple

00:40:26.390 --> 00:40:28.925
of years now called "The Random
Show," which is kind of

00:40:28.925 --> 00:40:32.290
like whatever we want to do--
it's this really silly random

00:40:32.290 --> 00:40:35.620
discussion that we
do via video--

00:40:35.620 --> 00:40:37.630
has ended up being pretty
well received.

00:40:37.630 --> 00:40:39.200
So I've thought about
the podcast, but

00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:40.990
nothing concrete yet.

00:40:40.990 --> 00:40:42.570
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:40:42.570 --> 00:40:49.070
AUDIENCE: So one of your books,
"4-Hour Body," you had

00:40:49.070 --> 00:40:51.270
mentioned something about--

00:40:51.270 --> 00:40:54.080
you're measuring a lot of
things, which is great, and

00:40:54.080 --> 00:40:57.230
trying to make decisions based
on that and coming up with

00:40:57.230 --> 00:40:58.390
simple rules of thumb.

00:40:58.390 --> 00:41:02.860
But for example, something like
don't drink milk because

00:41:02.860 --> 00:41:05.760
it has low glycemic index
but somehow it

00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:08.030
raises insulin a lot.

00:41:08.030 --> 00:41:12.380
But that's the protein in milk,
from what I understand,

00:41:12.380 --> 00:41:15.890
that, like all protein, actually
raises insulin too.

00:41:15.890 --> 00:41:19.490
But on one side, you recommend
something like, oh, eat, say,

00:41:19.490 --> 00:41:22.100
steak or something like that,
because that's good.

00:41:22.100 --> 00:41:23.695
But that's also going
to raise insulin.

00:41:23.695 --> 00:41:28.320
So some of those, you could
mix the signals.

00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:29.120
TIMOTHY FERRISS: Well, no.

00:41:29.120 --> 00:41:29.730
It's a good point.

00:41:29.730 --> 00:41:31.660
I mean, whenever you're dealing
with multivariate

00:41:31.660 --> 00:41:34.800
testing, whether it's a website
or your body, it's

00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:39.510
extremely easy-- you have to be
cautious about number one,

00:41:39.510 --> 00:41:42.110
isolating nutrients and drawing
conclusions on those

00:41:42.110 --> 00:41:45.160
nutrients, like beta carotene in
the '80s, which produced a

00:41:45.160 --> 00:41:46.410
lot of side effects when
people started

00:41:46.410 --> 00:41:48.230
ingesting it in isolation.

00:41:48.230 --> 00:41:53.080
Because at the time, science
could only measure a few of

00:41:53.080 --> 00:41:55.010
the things in those whole foods
and not the others.

00:41:55.010 --> 00:41:57.100
And those cofactors ended
up being very important.

00:41:57.100 --> 00:41:59.300
In the case of milk--

00:41:59.300 --> 00:42:00.710
particularly skim milk.

00:42:00.710 --> 00:42:03.210
So I have fewer issues with,
let's say, whole-fat milk.

00:42:03.210 --> 00:42:05.860
But if you're looking at the
glycemic load, glycemic impact

00:42:05.860 --> 00:42:09.140
of a meal, milk will tend to
be on the lower end of the

00:42:09.140 --> 00:42:12.270
range, but it's highly
insulinogenic.

00:42:12.270 --> 00:42:15.360
When you get into trouble in
particular is when you have

00:42:15.360 --> 00:42:19.480
high insulin combined with
processed carbohydrates and,

00:42:19.480 --> 00:42:22.050
let's say, trans-fatty acids
is when you get into pretty

00:42:22.050 --> 00:42:25.290
well-established territory
for causing damage.

00:42:25.290 --> 00:42:28.810
If you eat a fatty rib eye,
depending on your rate of

00:42:28.810 --> 00:42:32.180
ingestion, it shouldn't spike
your blood glucose much.

00:42:32.180 --> 00:42:36.110
So if your insulin, which is a
storage hormone, is relatively

00:42:36.110 --> 00:42:37.710
high, but you're not
spiking your

00:42:37.710 --> 00:42:39.110
glucose at the same time--

00:42:39.110 --> 00:42:42.080
which that would not do, as
contrasted with, let's say,

00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:43.750
whey protein isolate--

00:42:43.750 --> 00:42:44.870
then you should be OK.

00:42:44.870 --> 00:42:47.230
But I would say--

00:42:47.230 --> 00:42:49.860
just to lay out my general
approach, if we're talking

00:42:49.860 --> 00:42:54.550
about physical testing-- would
be look at PubMed and clinical

00:42:54.550 --> 00:42:58.540
research when possible to
identify experiments that I

00:42:58.540 --> 00:43:00.710
can do quickly on myself.

00:43:00.710 --> 00:43:04.290
Track predominately one
metric, ideally

00:43:04.290 --> 00:43:05.700
no more than two.

00:43:05.700 --> 00:43:09.440
And if it produces a magnitude
of result that is interesting

00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:14.320
for n equals 1, like subject
equals 1 study, or for even

00:43:14.320 --> 00:43:15.430
shorter studies--

00:43:15.430 --> 00:43:18.230
I'm sorry, for, let's say,
limited studies of 5 to 10, 15

00:43:18.230 --> 00:43:21.900
people, you can produce
a study that is

00:43:21.900 --> 00:43:23.820
statistically valid.

00:43:23.820 --> 00:43:27.060
If the magnitude of change is
high enough, the p value will

00:43:27.060 --> 00:43:29.520
be less than 0.05.

00:43:29.520 --> 00:43:32.020
If it turns out safe and does
something interesting, I'll

00:43:32.020 --> 00:43:35.720
then test it on, let's say, 20
to 100 of my followers, which

00:43:35.720 --> 00:43:36.390
we just did.

00:43:36.390 --> 00:43:38.260
There will be some data coming
out probably next week.

00:43:38.260 --> 00:43:41.280
We tested the slow-carb diet on
more than 1,000 people and

00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:43.120
had them track five or six
different habits so we could

00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:46.160
actually correlate
what produces the

00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:48.630
fastest rate of fat loss.

00:43:48.630 --> 00:43:51.630
And then I'll subject that to
my friends who are either

00:43:51.630 --> 00:43:52.990
scientists--

00:43:52.990 --> 00:43:56.200
like I'm involved with funding
some studies at UCSF in Adam

00:43:56.200 --> 00:43:57.660
Gazzaley's neuroimaging
lab right now.

00:44:00.620 --> 00:44:02.590
But the challenges,
of course--

00:44:02.590 --> 00:44:07.270
there are so many studies that
if ever completed with

00:44:07.270 --> 00:44:10.230
actionable results will
take 5, 10, 15 years.

00:44:10.230 --> 00:44:13.060
But people want to make
decisions now.

00:44:13.060 --> 00:44:15.060
And I think that whether that's
how you respond to

00:44:15.060 --> 00:44:18.600
caffeine withdrawal and ways
that you can facilitate that

00:44:18.600 --> 00:44:21.340
or otherwise, there
are some pretty--

00:44:21.340 --> 00:44:23.220
I think-- reliable ways
to self-experiment.

00:44:23.220 --> 00:44:24.040
But it's challenging.

00:44:24.040 --> 00:44:27.100
It's always challenging.

00:44:27.100 --> 00:44:29.570
AUDIENCE: In a book about
learning and everything, I

00:44:29.570 --> 00:44:32.750
know you're big on supplements
and nutrition and exercise.

00:44:32.750 --> 00:44:34.070
Do you have any recommendations
for creating a

00:44:34.070 --> 00:44:37.550
good healthy mind and everything
for retaining all

00:44:37.550 --> 00:44:39.670
this stuff that you're
picking up?

00:44:39.670 --> 00:44:42.650
TIMOTHY FERRISS: So supplements
or things for a

00:44:42.650 --> 00:44:44.230
healthy mind.

00:44:44.230 --> 00:44:45.355
Yeah, I do have some
recommendations.

00:44:45.355 --> 00:44:47.550
It depends on how far
you want to push it.

00:44:47.550 --> 00:44:50.750
I'm pretty aggressive, so
I've tried everything.

00:44:50.750 --> 00:44:51.410
Like modafinil--

00:44:51.410 --> 00:44:52.870
I'm like, eh, it's all right.

00:44:52.870 --> 00:44:56.150
But there's some really crazy
stuff you can do if you want

00:44:56.150 --> 00:44:58.310
to get really aggressive.

00:44:58.310 --> 00:45:00.570
That's Provigil, very
popular amongst

00:45:00.570 --> 00:45:02.000
CEOs in Silicon Valley.

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:06.950
But the starting point
is nutrition.

00:45:06.950 --> 00:45:09.560
That 30 grams of protein within
30 minutes of waking up

00:45:09.560 --> 00:45:12.920
will actually really facilitate
mental performance,

00:45:12.920 --> 00:45:14.760
as well, throughout the day.

00:45:14.760 --> 00:45:18.020
Secondly, a very cheap
neurological insurance policy

00:45:18.020 --> 00:45:20.800
is 5 grams of creatine
monohydrate per day.

00:45:20.800 --> 00:45:23.630
This is particularly true
if you're a vegetarian.

00:45:23.630 --> 00:45:27.130
That has been shown-- and this
is in clinical research-- to

00:45:27.130 --> 00:45:32.500
be very promising treatment for
minimizing the symptoms of

00:45:32.500 --> 00:45:36.880
or in fact delaying the onset of
neurodegenerative diseases

00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:39.820
like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's,
et cetera.

00:45:39.820 --> 00:45:41.800
So 5 grams of creatine
monohydrate, which will also

00:45:41.800 --> 00:45:43.050
make the gym more interesting.

00:45:45.690 --> 00:45:47.940
There are things you can get
aggressive with, like deprenyl

00:45:47.940 --> 00:45:48.380
and whatnot.

00:45:48.380 --> 00:45:50.270
But I would suggest staying
away from any of the

00:45:50.270 --> 00:45:53.770
prescription dementia drugs,
because I don't see there

00:45:53.770 --> 00:45:55.830
being a real reason to.

00:45:55.830 --> 00:45:58.090
There are some over-the-counter
things you

00:45:58.090 --> 00:45:59.600
can use that are very--

00:45:59.600 --> 00:46:01.930
and I'm no doctor, nor do I
play one on the internet.

00:46:01.930 --> 00:46:04.280
So caveat emptor.

00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:04.990
Do your own homework.

00:46:04.990 --> 00:46:08.260
But for instance, there are a
couple of combinations, like

00:46:08.260 --> 00:46:11.440
artichoke extract and forskolin,
which you can get

00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:13.920
at GNC, which when combined
do some pretty amazing

00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:15.060
things for the brain.

00:46:15.060 --> 00:46:17.590
I would just make sure you
budget 10 to 12 hours to sleep

00:46:17.590 --> 00:46:20.590
that night, because you're
going to need it.

00:46:20.590 --> 00:46:22.760
And then whenever you're
consuming anything that might

00:46:22.760 --> 00:46:26.590
increase mental performance,
like let's say the racetam

00:46:26.590 --> 00:46:28.600
class of smart drugs-- so
piracetam is kind of the

00:46:28.600 --> 00:46:31.070
granddaddy of this racetam
class of smart drugs.

00:46:31.070 --> 00:46:33.670
Then you have phenylpiracetam,
which is popular among

00:46:33.670 --> 00:46:36.275
biathletes because it increases
cold tolerance and

00:46:36.275 --> 00:46:38.750
is also very stimulatory.

00:46:38.750 --> 00:46:40.840
If you use something like that--
and this is true for

00:46:40.840 --> 00:46:42.900
sports nutrition or any
type of supplements.

00:46:42.900 --> 00:46:45.580
This doesn't apply just to this
crazy stuff that I do.

00:46:48.200 --> 00:46:50.330
If it is improving your
performance by burning your

00:46:50.330 --> 00:46:53.820
fuel faster, you have to
replenish that fuel.

00:46:53.820 --> 00:46:56.570
And a lot of people skip that
part of the equation.

00:46:56.570 --> 00:46:58.320
And they end up having really
bad side effects or just

00:46:58.320 --> 00:46:59.310
feeling tired.

00:46:59.310 --> 00:47:01.730
So if you take something like
phenylpiracetam, you want to

00:47:01.730 --> 00:47:05.420
combine it with a choline
supplementation.

00:47:05.420 --> 00:47:08.020
And if you want something with
high choline content, like

00:47:08.020 --> 00:47:08.770
whole eggs.

00:47:08.770 --> 00:47:10.930
Get whole eggs from
a very good source

00:47:10.930 --> 00:47:12.180
and consume the yolks.

00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:16.120
I can go on and on about it.

00:47:16.120 --> 00:47:19.670
But I would say in general,
high protein intake.

00:47:19.670 --> 00:47:24.190
And if you're looking to
increase consolidation and

00:47:24.190 --> 00:47:28.940
retention, take a look at lucid
dreaming and how you can

00:47:28.940 --> 00:47:31.700
increase your percentage
of REM sleep.

00:47:31.700 --> 00:47:36.030
So sleep, like the inactive
phase in the learning process,

00:47:36.030 --> 00:47:37.820
is very important.

00:47:37.820 --> 00:47:40.480
And there are people who've
experimented with things like

00:47:40.480 --> 00:47:42.420
huperzine A or galantamine.

00:47:42.420 --> 00:47:43.930
I wouldn't recommend
galantamine, necessarily.

00:47:43.930 --> 00:47:45.380
There's some pretty gnarly
side effects.

00:47:45.380 --> 00:47:48.110
But huperzine A, which is
an acetylcholinesterase

00:47:48.110 --> 00:47:51.830
inhibitor, by some accounts
increased REM sleep.

00:47:51.830 --> 00:47:53.940
So you can actually end up
accelerating, let's say, your

00:47:53.940 --> 00:47:57.380
retention of foreign
vocabulary,

00:47:57.380 --> 00:47:58.430
which is pretty cool.

00:47:58.430 --> 00:48:01.060
There are also flotation tanks
around the Bay Area, like

00:48:01.060 --> 00:48:03.650
sensory deprivation tanks, which
have some really cool

00:48:03.650 --> 00:48:06.300
applications for accelerating
stuff like that

00:48:06.300 --> 00:48:07.610
which require no drugs.

00:48:07.610 --> 00:48:08.920
Maybe a plus.

00:48:08.920 --> 00:48:10.594
So those are a couple
of ideas.

00:48:10.594 --> 00:48:10.804
AUDIENCE: Awesome.

00:48:10.804 --> 00:48:11.016
Thank you.

00:48:11.016 --> 00:48:11.440
Appreciate it.

00:48:11.440 --> 00:48:12.550
TIMOTHY FERRISS: Of course.

00:48:12.550 --> 00:48:14.210
MALE SPEAKER: Let's all
thank Tim for coming.

00:48:14.210 --> 00:48:15.190
TIMOTHY FERRISS: Thanks for
coming out, everybody.

00:48:15.190 --> 00:48:19.863
