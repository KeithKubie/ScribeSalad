again I'm sorry I'm back in but it's

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:03.149
again I'm sorry I'm back in but it's
 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:09.490
again I'm sorry I'm back in but it's
been a few years that I spoke about

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:09.500
been a few years that I spoke about
 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:14.780
been a few years that I spoke about
physics to anyone this was one of the

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790
physics to anyone this was one of the
 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.279
physics to anyone this was one of the
things that I was working on when I was

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289
things that I was working on when I was
 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.620
things that I was working on when I was
in grade 11 which tries to understand M

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630
in grade 11 which tries to understand M
 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.349
in grade 11 which tries to understand M
is M naught divided by one minus square

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359
is M naught divided by one minus square
 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.480
is M naught divided by one minus square
root of 1 minus v square by C square the

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490
root of 1 minus v square by C square the
 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.400
root of 1 minus v square by C square the
equation that led Einstein to discover

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410
equation that led Einstein to discover
 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.250
equation that led Einstein to discover
is equal to mV MC squared I try to work

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260
is equal to mV MC squared I try to work
 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.549
is equal to mV MC squared I try to work
out other possible equations that I

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559
out other possible equations that I
 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.470
out other possible equations that I
could derive out of it and one

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480
could derive out of it and one
 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.380
could derive out of it and one
interesting thing I was working on was

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390
interesting thing I was working on was
 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.459
interesting thing I was working on was
in trying to understand what happens to

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469
in trying to understand what happens to
 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.190
in trying to understand what happens to
mass at speed of light which I believe

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200
mass at speed of light which I believe
 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.350
mass at speed of light which I believe
must completely converts into ether

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360
must completely converts into ether
 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:54.319
must completely converts into ether
which is energy ok so you see here M is

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329
which is energy ok so you see here M is
 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.860
which is energy ok so you see here M is
M naught blah blah blah this is what I

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870
M naught blah blah blah this is what I
 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.990
M naught blah blah blah this is what I
got to em I am NOT is e naught minus 2 K

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000
got to em I am NOT is e naught minus 2 K
 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.329
got to em I am NOT is e naught minus 2 K
so this is the ratio between mass in

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339
so this is the ratio between mass in
 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.609
so this is the ratio between mass in
motion and mass at rest is equal to

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619
motion and mass at rest is equal to
 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.539
motion and mass at rest is equal to
ratio between energy at rest- to kinetic

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549
ratio between energy at rest- to kinetic
 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.440
ratio between energy at rest- to kinetic
energy / energy in motion now energy at

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450
energy / energy in motion now energy at
 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.600
energy / energy in motion now energy at
rest and energy in motion is I

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610
rest and energy in motion is I
 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.149
rest and energy in motion is I
understand it is my creation and and

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159
understand it is my creation and and
 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.580
understand it is my creation and and
nothing of that sort exists question

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590
nothing of that sort exists question
 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.920
nothing of that sort exists question
number one are these valid can I assume

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930
number one are these valid can I assume
 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.550
number one are these valid can I assume
he not and eat question number two thus

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560
he not and eat question number two thus
 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.490
he not and eat question number two thus
this equation make any sense because if

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500
this equation make any sense because if
 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.440
this equation make any sense because if
it does I would like to work on this in

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450
it does I would like to work on this in
 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.660
it does I would like to work on this in
trying to understand how does matter get

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670
trying to understand how does matter get
 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.420

and speed of light thank you so much

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340
and speed of light thank you so much
 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.840
and speed of light thank you so much
thank you

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850
