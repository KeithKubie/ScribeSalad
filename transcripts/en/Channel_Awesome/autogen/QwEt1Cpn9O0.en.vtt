like that I just it's it's a tough one
 

00:08:10.169 --> 00:08:11.540
like that I just it's it's a tough one
because if the story was a little

00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:11.550
because if the story was a little
 

00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:13.730
because if the story was a little
stronger and really supported it like

00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:13.740
stronger and really supported it like
 

00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:15.200

nothing new for me um and I know for
something that was so built up I was

00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:27.750
something that was so built up I was
 

00:08:27.750 --> 00:08:30.110
something that was so built up I was
hoping like I said just something of a

00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:30.120
hoping like I said just something of a
 

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:33.260
hoping like I said just something of a
stronger payoff but now that I know that

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:33.270
stronger payoff but now that I know that
 

00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:35.240
stronger payoff but now that I know that
that does help yeah that does help me

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:35.250
that does help yeah that does help me
 

00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:36.800
that does help yeah that does help me
appreciate it a little bit more and it's

00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:36.810
appreciate it a little bit more and it's
 

00:08:36.810 --> 00:08:38.149
appreciate it a little bit more and it's
like oh it's like another dimension

00:08:38.149 --> 00:08:38.159
like oh it's like another dimension
 

00:08:38.159 --> 00:08:40.520

bubble I'm just guessing oh that's not

00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:43.050
bubble I'm just guessing oh that's not
 

00:08:43.050 --> 00:08:45.230
bubble I'm just guessing oh that's not
even like what I've seen that's better

00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:45.240
even like what I've seen that's better
 

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:46.910
even like what I've seen that's better
I'm just guessing well no just that we

00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:46.920
I'm just guessing well no just that we
 

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:50.390
I'm just guessing well no just that we
know he's transported to you know an

00:08:50.390 --> 00:08:50.400
know he's transported to you know an
 

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:52.670
know he's transported to you know an
area that's not there and you can see

00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:52.680
area that's not there and you can see
 

00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:53.870
area that's not there and you can see
through it and stuff I mean we don't

00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:53.880
through it and stuff I mean we don't
 

00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:54.170
through it and stuff I mean we don't
know

00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:54.180
know
 

00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:56.780
know
it is but we if it didn't connect to the

00:08:56.780 --> 00:08:56.790
it is but we if it didn't connect to the
 

00:08:56.790 --> 00:08:59.180
it is but we if it didn't connect to the
episode at all that I serve be like what

00:08:59.180 --> 00:08:59.190
episode at all that I serve be like what
 

00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:00.139
episode at all that I serve be like what
the hell but the fact you see

00:09:00.139 --> 00:09:00.149
the hell but the fact you see
 

00:09:00.149 --> 00:09:01.670
the hell but the fact you see
materialize there's like okay it does

00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:01.680
materialize there's like okay it does
 

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:04.870
materialize there's like okay it does
connect it does the appellees connect um

00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:04.880
connect it does the appellees connect um
 

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:08.180
connect it does the appellees connect um
so it'll be interesting if that if that

00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:08.190
so it'll be interesting if that if that
 

00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:09.350
so it'll be interesting if that if that
leads to something like in another

00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:09.360
leads to something like in another
 

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:11.090
leads to something like in another
episode you do see all these things were

00:09:11.090 --> 00:09:11.100
episode you do see all these things were
 

00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:12.530
episode you do see all these things were
part of another world or something or

00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:12.540
part of another world or something or
 

00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:14.060
part of another world or something or
something else watching other worlds I

00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:14.070
something else watching other worlds I
 

00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:15.980
something else watching other worlds I
mean that should be fun I mean then be a

00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:15.990
mean that should be fun I mean then be a
 

00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:18.050
mean that should be fun I mean then be a
great build up to it I mean that is one

00:09:18.050 --> 00:09:18.060
great build up to it I mean that is one
 

00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:19.010
great build up to it I mean that is one
of the great things about the show is

that you can do that you know you can
just bring something back that maybe

00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:23.580
just bring something back that maybe
 

00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:25.730
just bring something back that maybe
didn't think of before or like didn't

00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:25.740
didn't think of before or like didn't
 

00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:29.030
didn't think of before or like didn't
make sense before but now it does um so

00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:29.040
make sense before but now it does um so
 

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:30.829
make sense before but now it does um so
I like to see that because actually it

maybe instead you hear Finn and Jake in
in the other ends of the circle and you

00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:49.800
in the other ends of the circle and you
 

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:51.470
in the other ends of the circle and you
don't hear what's actually inside the

00:09:51.470 --> 00:09:51.480
don't hear what's actually inside the
 

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:53.060
don't hear what's actually inside the

it's like I can see it's as good
 

00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:04.940
it's like I can see it's as good
build-up to another episode but on its

00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:04.950
build-up to another episode but on its
 

00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:07.040
build-up to another episode but on its
own O's is kind of a yeah it's like if

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:07.050
own O's is kind of a yeah it's like if
 

00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:09.380

00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:09.390
you got rid of that and you only watch
 

00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:11.090
you got rid of that and you only watch
the episode itself it's not bad

00:10:11.090 --> 00:10:11.100
the episode itself it's not bad
 

00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:14.000
the episode itself it's not bad
interesting yeah and if you look at the

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:14.010
interesting yeah and if you look at the
 

00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:15.590
interesting yeah and if you look at the
outer rims you know it's it's a neat

00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:15.600
outer rims you know it's it's a neat
 

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:18.350
outer rims you know it's it's a neat
idea and I can see it going so where

00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:18.360
idea and I can see it going so where
 

00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:19.430
idea and I can see it going so where
like I would live if they brought it

00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:19.440
like I would live if they brought it
 

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:22.640
like I would live if they brought it
back and did even more with it no so

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:22.650
back and did even more with it no so
 

00:10:22.650 --> 00:10:25.579
back and did even more with it no so
