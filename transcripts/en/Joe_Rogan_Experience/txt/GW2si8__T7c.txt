Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Oh yeah, that's all he is. And we're live. That's it. Hi. Hello? Richie. Yeah, this stuff. Purple Venom. That's what he calls it. That's what his friend calls it. And uh, yeah, it's friends like, you know, I'm pretty skeptical, skeptical about other people's stuff. But then you try to hope. Now was that a coke nail? No Fun. No. I know people think long and people think that their coke nails do not know they're real. You. You don't do coke. I don't do coke ever. Have you ever done me? I do. Coke zero. I have done, I, I have done a, it's like coke light. It's like, it looks like coke. You can snort it. It feels like coke weed doesn't give you high. Um, no. Uh, I, I have, I've tried it. I would say honestly maybe four times and I've never, it's always just felt like I just took three shots of espresso and I'm not, it's not really, it doesn't do anything for me.

Speaker 1:          00:00:48       Then I'm like, I better get him a better invest in that. I need to try it one day because it just, I need to know what's going on. I'm 51 years old. How do I know no what coke is? I, you know, I think it's worth, I mean, if you don't, if you, you know, if you don't have a predisposition for being a hyper addictive personality, I definitely do. But Oh gosh, I'm also wise enough to know and I can quit things and you've got experience. You can control yourself. But like I, I, I was never, I was never like, I guess I've just never been someone who's like, Oh shit. Gotta have that forever. Like I've never been that way. The only thing that I'm reduced to now is just weed. That's it. Well, me too. But I also think that it's one of those things if your, if your life is healthy, if you have a good balance and you're enjoying your time and you're being creative and you have good friends and you have fun, you're not looking for something to fuck your life up.

Speaker 1:          00:01:35       I think many of the times when you dealing with people that have like severe, debilitating addictions that are really just taking over their life, there's something else going on. Almost always just like problems, you know, relationship problems, work problems, life problems. Yeah. They're not happy yet. There's an emptiness. There's an emptiness that wants to be fed or maybe you have a lot of success and you're freaking out about the success. I think that happens with some celebrities. Yes, I think so. Yeah. Overstimulation and you don't know how to handle, let's do this show. Yeah, let's do it. Yeah. Here it is. So you can have the first I used to an automated machine or the auto. Have you heard of it? No. So cool. It's like this like little reminder and it's like grinder and it, and it fits on a tube that you put an empty rolling thing in there and say like you put that in there or you got it.

Speaker 1:          00:02:20       Um, and then it's like a, yeah, it's like a clear tube. You put it in the pre-rolled, you know, empty, whatever joint thing. And then a, and then you put this machine that just goes over, attaches magnetically, and then you put it in your weed and you just press a button and it's like coffee makers and it fills it up perfectly. And then you just pack it by shaking it and twisting it and you're done. These goddamn stoners today, they're getting too crazy. I don't, I rarely spoke. I always make exceptions for stuff like this. You look at it? Yeah. Wow. That's actually a pretty sleek looking. Yeah, that's by banana brothers I think. You know, I, I smoked pretty regularly but um, I got high with be real. I did a this smoke box show and I'm like, okay, I'm going to be real a rat Cypress Hill.

Speaker 1:          00:03:06       I was separate and it would catch him how dialogize I bought it. I just see now I know nothing about hip hop. See that damn ready? I not know anything about Cypress Hill. I know, I know. People are always like, you gotta know about hip hop. I'm like, I know shit. I know. Run DMC, you really don't know any hip hop. Now I kind of stopped after the Bohemian phase, you know, like after a tribe called quest and de la soul. Like it just kind of lost me because it then it turned into I liked gangster in the beginning, you know, cause it was something new and you're like, what the fuck is this? Oh that's so cool. You know? But uh, then it kind of morphed into club hop where it just was all about bitches and cars and all that shit. And it was really the lyrics, the beats I loved.

Speaker 1:          00:03:43       I thought it was cool, but I just like, no, I mean I, because I left in 95, I left pop in 95, 96 and then I know there's plenty of hip hop heads. I'd be like, dude, you gotta check out so you gotta check out. You get your, I know there's shit loads of shit and I'm, maybe I'll go back into that phase. But mostly I just liked the beats and the production and the lyrics. I'm not really, I'm not, I'm not a lyrics guy anyways. I am a lyrics guy and Nas is definitely my favorite lyricist because his stuff is so creative. Like what it was that one, we did everything backwards to the whole song backwards. Like he started at the end then what the fuck was that called? James can rewind. Yeah. I mean I mean made you look creative. Yeah. It made you look like I saw that and I was like, that was actually a moment where I was like, Oh am I gonna am I going to start getting back into this shit?

Speaker 1:          00:04:30       Cause cause it was intelligent. Um, you know what I mean? Like my thing is like if you're going to be boastful and all this shit, it should be like Muhammad Ali. Right, right, right. You should have clever, clever flare, but also you can just be right in someone's face. But I liked that. But then when people are like kind of going off about how much money they have and all that shit, I'm like, I don't really care about that. Well I, I've analyzed this many times while under the influence, the culture, it comes from not having something. And then once you have something bragged about it, right, like that's like Jay z, like that's a 99 problems. He talks about that 99 problems. Yeah, I mean I get it, I get it. But like at the same time if the, if it just sounds like basically the three things that everyone talks about, which is like women cars of some sort and money or the things that you can buy with money after awhile it just all bleeds together.

Speaker 1:          00:05:19       It's all this, it's the same song and I mean it's so dope that you can come from nothing and you can work your way up and you can hustle and you can get stuff going in. But like once you get to that place, like why not take advantage of that? Plus what about run the jewels? I've heard good things about chance the rapper. I've heard good things about it. God Dang. I know. I don't know shit man. I'm more of like a the jewels. So cream and electronic guy. I like music. Let me, let me turn you on to some run the jewels. I wish we could play it on the podcast, but then we can't do that anymore. Back in your day, yeah, they would run your Julius and out of town, but back in the day when you had a, like the Internet was, no one knew what a podcast was.

Speaker 1:          00:05:57       You could do all kinds of shit. You could just play things. I mean you still can, I mean the best live stream you could take him down and get d monetized. You get a strike against your channel. If you get three strikes, they take your channel down permanently. [inaudible] Youtube. Yes. That's the real problem. I'd choose the real problem. I'm a, I'm bypassing all that very soon. What are you doing? I'm just doing my own live streaming. That's all right. Yeah cause that way I just don't have to worry about all that bullshit. Yeah, I mean that lead, that's where it's probably going to have to go. Yes. But at the same time everybody's at Youtube. Yeah. So, so the, the secret is, or the question is like how can you, it could be both. Yeah, exactly. That. That was the way to zero. Zero Alcohol High Mountain.

Speaker 1:          00:06:42       Are you serious? Yeah, I'll try to zero. Yeah. Cause my problem with alcohol is alcohol. So yeah. Actually they taste like a regular Hanukkah trick. What I found out, if you see these, what does that, it's a microtech uh, California legal switchblade. What? Yeah. What are you stabbing people at a tiny knife. What are you doing right now? I've been going on since I saw you. I like it. Well, I like having done that. I'm from Montana. You always have a knife. You just always have it. It's like the greatest tool, but uh, it makes sense. How's the button go? Okay. So hold it the opposite way. Turn it around. Flip it around. Yep. And then the button on the top side. See there's like a lever. No thing here. So this is on the back of the glass breaker. Okay. Oh, glass breaker for like if you're in your car, you know, or whatever.

Speaker 1:          00:07:33       I needed to break the window. Jesus. Um, but uh, here's the switch. Does that really what that's for? Yes. Let me say that mean. Crazy. So this would break your window? Yeah. Hmm. But how many people do you think could break a window with this? I bet if you've got a lot of people and some old car windows and like, like line them up and just fucking, yeah because it seems like that's like, that's like kind of weird. A weird like standardized tip for glass breakers really. That crazy. So would you see, but it seems like it's slime in your hand. It doesn't, it's too small. I think if you, you know, if you wedge it, if you held it tight and your fist, you know with your thumb over. I think if you hit at it's more about velocity I think rather than strength black it.

Speaker 1:          00:08:15       Yeah. Because the way it's designed is to just be like super like precise strike wants carrying a glass breaker with them, man. Yeah we're playing the games. You Ready? Do you have water? You have like bottled water in your comment cards? I have bottled water, I have a jumper, jumper self. You know you can jump yourself if you have bottled water in your car in La you're basically drinking. What is that shit that comes the leaks into your from your plastic PC. BPS. I'm not using, I have glass. It's all glass. You have glass. How dare now. Fuck that. I don't, I'm not, I mean like people are going to be like bitch him. Cause I talk about plastic bottles all the time, but oh, because we have one here. Yeah, it's you, it's a better solution for that. B, get glass and get a water judge.

Speaker 1:          00:08:56       Hey, just you just get a, you just get a municipal filter and that's it. And you get alkalized water room temperature, whatever. And you can just have clean water and you just have tons and tons of vessels. I'm sure. What someone would BKR would sponsor you or something like that. That'd be kr. They're uh, they're uh, like uh, I guess you'd a canteen company or water carrying like Judd Company. It's having people drink out of mason jars. That would be terrible. Like old folks. Yeah. Hell yeah. Are you kidding? Yeah. It'd be like a, you know, like grandma's kitchen cupboard. Yeah. Why do people like drinking out of Mason Jars? I think it started with grandma's. What was that band? What was that one brand? No, it was that one. Um, sort of a bluesy rocky band that pretty recently. Bam. Goddamn whizzer. Jamie's damn wizard. How he do it?

Speaker 1:          00:09:49       He's how he do it. He knows what I'm going to ask before I, he googles it. He's a wizard. He got something. He's got something, some special talent, but a, yeah, those guys, they dressed like they were from another era. Right. They wore like weird clothes from like the pioneer days. They look like time travelers, like from a steam conqueror. I mean kind of. I mean, I know what you're saying. Like in the beginning, you know, Fortune Fester, the, Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. It's really funny. She's funny. She had her, she's, I wish I remember her joke, but she had a funny joke about Mumford and sons and mason jars. W really sweet. Yeah. Oh, that's good. I think it was like something to the tune of, you know, shoes, Mason jars for real, not like, not like this bullshit. Oh yeah. So I actually grew up poor.

Speaker 1:          00:10:33       I think that was it. I apologize from wrong. That wasn't, I mean, that's very funny. I mean, she is. She's so rad. I saw her in a, an Oh and Australia. Sydney. She's doing a podcast with Tom Papa. Oh yeah. Who's Tom Papa? Sorry, dare you again. Sorry guys. Tom Papa is a brilliant standup comedian. Really, really funny guy. Super, Super Nice guy too. And he's the master of bread. He read bread. Oh Shit. He makes his own sourdough bread and it is sensational out that, that, that's, that's, that's too much. Versus to be able to take over here. He brings a loaf of bread and grass fed butter. Oh no, Bro. You cannot resist us. This bread, it's bread is so good. Fuck your Kito Diet. If it does include Tom Papa's bread. Fuck your Quito Diet. Does he sell it at a bake? No, no, no, no. Just makes himself, there he is.

Speaker 1:          00:11:27       And he has a, here's a television show he's doing on a food network where he's visiting bakers. He's a brilliant guy and super nice guy. Like couldn't be a nicer guy and just loves making bags. He's so silly. That's meat and his bread. It's so good. And it's like, I really believe this, that if you get the food from someone who's really cool, like it feels different. It tastes different. And Tom's just, Tom is just such a nice guy and he's so funny and he's so smart. Like when you're eating his bread, like you feel like I'm eating a cool guy's bread. Yeah. You know, it's like someone who you love cooks. You sound like if your mom cooks you something, it's like wow. So it's not just good. It's good. And it comes from love. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Cause yeah, the person who made it to standing right there.

Speaker 1:          00:12:12       Right. You're having it. Yeah. It's pretty unique experience. Especially with bread. Yeah. I think that's the big thing with food too, with, with cooking. You know, I, I never really thought of food as an art form until I started watching no reservations, which was a Anthony Bourdain's original show backwards on the travel channel. Okay. And then I was like, oh Duh. Like I in my head, like they were just cooks. I'll go. They just cook and food. Cause I cooked food before I used to work at Newport creamery. I made burgers. Yeah. Make grilled cheese. Sure. Yeah. Yeah. That's cool. Good. So it's like I knew how to put the fucking fries in. Yeah. But watching these chefs create these like really elaborate creative dishes, you start going, oh, oh this is an art form. It's just a like a weird one. Like it's temporary. It doesn't, don't only exist for a short window in time, but now that we have film of it and now that we have photographs of it, like things in Instagram, now you start to appreciate that.

Speaker 1:          00:13:09       Oh, it looks amazing too. I guess part of the thing, it's like if you could have like the most incredible steak, but it came to you and it looked like the shittiest looking lentil soup, like split pea soup. It's like a split. Just put just a Gr, just the peas though. Just a bowl of green. But it was the most incredible taste, like, yeah. But it looks weird. Yes. Right, right, right. But yeah, but they're like, they're making things like, yeah, they're addressing it as many senses as possible now. Like everything red looks good. Yeah. Looks like seven. You want to hit cross in the outside of those little slices on the top of the circle the bread. Like look at that. See how it gets. Yeah, I know. Yeah. And you're like, oh, this has to, we have to take care of this. Yes.

Speaker 1:          00:13:48       It's our message. It's art too. It's like, it's a temporary art form. We just think of art as something like, you know, that Buddhist statue or something that just lasts forever. Yeah. But there's some art, like a sandcastle temporary. Well, you know, in a, in a weird way. Um, or in, in a weird way, music is kind of like that if it's not recorded, right? Yeah. Well, no, I mean if it is recorded because you only experienced it temporarily, but it is this as an idea in your head, you know, that like a, like a ghost image of it. But then when you listened, listened to it, when you press play and you listen to it, it's happening in real time. As soon as you stop it, it's no longer, no longer exists. So you're still just like in the kind of shadow memory of it. Right. If you're not interacting with it, it doesn't exist. Yeah. Wow. Yeah. Imagine there was something like that you could do with smells, right. Oh, smells one sense. That doesn't get any love like your eyes, people who make all these beautiful things. Right. Your ears. People make beautiful music. Yeah. You got like

Speaker 2:          00:14:51       perfume, Cologne and some fucking flowers. It's all you got [inaudible] and weird shit like Pachulia where like settle down, settle down. So that way you wouldn't set it down. What? You wouldn't have beads settle down. Settle Down with your instinct. Incense sticks, amber, amber sticks, amber smells. By the way, Ms Pat, after she was on, she sent me incentive. Did you send it to you to Black Pussy incense? Does she make one? No, she was just talking about crazy incense. A flavor that she, she, she's aware of. Oh, she's saying she uses them or people use, I mean the thing is you know that there's a niche market where people were making custom incense with names like that. Right? Like they legitimately are. I'm naming them that way because it's a hip thing. Yeah. That's a very specific kind of person. Right? If you're in an intense person, you have some kind of rug on the floor, like some kind of Persian type rug.

Speaker 2:          00:15:49       Is Ms Pat that she said? Yeah. So what is it? Hey Joe Rogan could have said you. These one says button naked. What is the other ones? How many lack of love. There you go. Black butter. Yeah, pussy to. Do you know Ms Pat? No. Oh my God, you got to meet her. She's a funny, she's one of the funniest human beings on earth for sure. Damn. One of the funniest people I've ever met, like right up there with Joey Diaz. Shit. She's so funny. She's ridiculous. Like you leave a podcast with her and your fucking face hurts. Someone said that if you get John Witherspoon, Joey Diaz, and miss pat on a podcast together, we would like break the space time continuum. Are you going to do it? Fuck yeah, I would love to do this, but I would just, I would, I would shut my mouth. I wouldn't say a word.

Speaker 2:          00:16:33       I'm like, I just want them to have fun. Do you know John Witherspoon? I don't know dude. He came on with his son. His son. JD is a comic as well. Yeah, I met JD at the comedy store and we're talking about his dad. I'm like, your dad is, he's like epic human being like, he's so fucking funny. And he's like, let me, let me get my dad to come into the podcast. We're like, yeah, let's do it. I would love to have you guys on, let's see. Come on. So, uh, it might acts with my idea. I don't remember how it came out. But anyway, he comes in here and it's like, the sun is like completely normal. Jay d intelligent. He's funny. He's like very, very like you've, you've, you know, you're not shocked by him. He's a funny, Smart Guy, but his dad is from another planet.

Speaker 2:          00:17:15       Everything he says is funny the way he says it. It's funny, he does not give a fuck. Oh, I know that cat dude. Yeah, he's on like his own groove. He's on this a, I don't give a fuck times a million groove and it's been doing it a long time. Even as it sounds like laughing like wow. He's like, see this is what I grew up with. I'm like, that is crazy. He's so funny. Like that guy. You can make him funny in a movie. You know, you give him a good movie part, he'll deal, do great in it. But he will never be able to compare it to him. Just being him in the moment. Cause you lose that in the moment. Well you know, he doesn't have anything planned out. He's not reading a fucking script. The guy just for three hours is just hilarious about anything about shoes.

Speaker 2:          00:17:58       He's hilarious about money. He's hilarious about his drink. He gets to put his money in his pocket and rub it like he's, yeah, he like can hit any, any angle, anything is fair game. It's, he's doing a kind of art. The Art of being him, this is what me and his son were talking about and this is why it relates he's doing an art form, but it seems like he's just being himself and he is, but he's figured out how to beat himself. That is the most hilarious to the most people and it's a matter of whether or not you can plug that into a movie successfully. Schmidt, maybe the best thing about him, just let them talk. Just let them talk like fuck your fuck your scripts. Like this guy's got a thing. You know he's got a thing. Yes. That is, it's an art about art.

Speaker 2:          00:18:43       It's like, it's just like cooking. It's just like any like just like music. There's an art to being a person even. Yeah, for sure. Yeah. Right. Like why are some girls sexier? Is it just biology or is there an art to the way they communicate with you? Like when people are being flirtatious and and talking to each other. There's an art to that. Just like a little bit of a dance going on there. Yes, absolutely. Some people are better at it. Yeah, I mean, yeah. I mean it's a, you know, what gets your attention? I mean there's so many factors and it's like what it's like also like what you tend to view, what's the first cue that generally will set you off, whatever that is experienced as you were a kid or you know, someone, your aunt or whatever it was was really cool and your cousin was a really sexy, and those two, a combination of those two elements are like something that you hit.

Speaker 2:          00:19:34       But I will say like, yeah, I think it's just someone who's, who's come when they're comfortable with themselves. They just have, it also depends on what you're looking for too, but because there's a co-residents, there has to be just like art, just like music. We're talking about like, do you like it or not music to you, it might be the greatest song of all time to Jamie. He's like, yeah, I can take it or leave it. Yeah. Yeah. And then we can have a con, you can have an argument about it, which is really sweet. No one's ever right. The bottom out. Yeah. It's all subjective. Love Motley crew. You love Molly crew. It's not, it's not, this isn't anything wrong with bloody crude example, but if you, if you're fucking at home by yourself going [inaudible] you're loving it. That, that's art. Like why was that judge, I do that with Whitesnake all the fucking debts up.

Speaker 2:          00:20:19       Told the story before. But a dude sent me in a Whitesnake is set and a, I, I used to, it's in the office because, uh, I had a girlfriend that made me throw it away after I got in a car accident. I had a Whitesnake is set in my call. Why? Why don't you make it? Because she thought it was bad Juju. She's really into telling me what to do. She was older than me. Okay. And, um, she, uh, she's packing up all my stuff cause I, my car was broken, you know, got, I got t boned and uh, as I'm grabbing all my stuff, um, she's like, leave that.

Speaker 1:          00:20:48       I go leave what? She's like, leave the white snake, see like you gotta get over that music. And I was like, really? She's like, yeah, it's terrible music. She was in like the pixies, that kind of Shit I don't even know existed back then. I loved that. I loved them too. But I also loved Whitesnake. There's a thing that people do though where they only like things that make them appear smart or interesting and there's like, it's like a hustle. Like you, you tell people you're really an Indian food and you really, you might really be, but there's also a thing you're doing. Like you're, you're that person that's only into the cool stuff, but like that fucking Whitesnake song is bad ass. [inaudible] yeah, that's, it's awesome. They only had a few that were like really good. They had that song is fucking bang and to this day is this love.

Speaker 1:          00:21:38       That's a sexy video. That was good videos. It's like one of my favorite videos. It's like the coolest, even though it was eighties and it was like hyper eighties it's one of the few videos to me in my mind that is, that had a style, that was that kind of approach is timeless. Really? Yeah. In a way it's good this week, this sincere, the sincerity of it. I mean that video is sexy with tawny contain and and and like her moving like around the bed or whatever. It was classy. It was, it was like sexiest, very adult kind of like watch it shit I have, but she looks amazing and, and I love him just leaning on the wall like that. I mean it's like come on, just take brick wall and he's like, Mr Cool Guy. Certainly it's, it's done in such a sincere way, but it's just on the right side of me still thinking that it's fucking great.

Speaker 1:          00:22:34       It's great art direction. It's promoting ridiculous interactions. It promote him up promoting a ridiculous, a relationship. Just fucking talk. What is all this trauma? I mean that shit like those shots come on. His hair is one man. He's very serious about what he's singing. He's like a better look and Luke from general hospital. I remember Luke and Laura. That's what that guy is like a better look in Luke. That's so hilarious. His hair is preposterous. I know everybody's hair is just like off the chart. Imagine if you had a friend that just had hair like that. Like, Hey, let's go down, let's go hit the gym. He's like, hey man, you want to go go. And he's Kinda like, look at some a gallon of hairspray and that shit I primped out. That's just, I mean, back then, that's just crazy to me. That's white hair, bro.

Speaker 1:          00:23:20       Yeah. You have the solution to that. Yeah. Yeah. Your hair, you just, it's fantastic. You don't have to do anything. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's a totally lazy, it's lazy. Yeah. It's chaos. But at the same time like, ah know, but there's no work involved in that. No. It's a beautiful chaos. Oh, I see what you're saying. As opposed to like, you know you got one of them pics and you're spraying pics and spray. Oh yeah, his hair that, oh I know there's a lot of work involved there. That's a shit ton of hairsprays the lady offset. It's just to keep pumping. Yeah, kind of constantly checking, symmetry, duty cheering and Jan, I mean the, the guitar, the band that like Whitesnake the band once it was like, it was the Super Group of hard rock like, like it or metal. I guess you can kind of, it kind of bleeds into that.

Speaker 1:          00:24:10       Like classic metal. This has been a few of those supergroups I just went freaked me out man. I'm like, yeah, off the car. 20th doing the Car Lady. It's like she doesn't, she just doesn't care. She's rude. She's doing cartwheels and wild look up since serious. That's what I mean man. He's really serious about what he's singing about and he's got three synth players in a row, but in the way. Yeah, look at that. Yeah. How, what does that mean? That's kind of hardcore. I wish we could play this cause it's so wonderful. I do love the idea. I mean let the hair color combination in the car. I mean, you know what, this is good. This is what happened when the war on drugs had a brief victory. Oh, what happened that you were talking about the band for a second. I'm like, ma'am, you are talking about tense release times care here.

Speaker 1:          00:24:57       You're talking about the time Jimi Hendrix in this. Is that the absence of drugs like Oh this music created all this coke, this coke music. This is definitely, maybe it's every now and then, but it's not created by coke. Yeah, but it's like high end party. You know, like these guys are living like the high end party shit. Sure. I guess that's, I guess that's where they're coming from. But I mean to me that's what I like. You know, someone described the Ns ten's the uh, the uh, classic stage monitors or sorry, studio monitors. Like when you're switching between different types of speakers, show me what that looks like. Um, right now you and Jamie were on the same frequency. He's the audio guy. Oh yeah, yeah. Well they're like a, they were like this classic mixing and like that, like our atone and like they're just like speaker systems that have kind of become standards to a certain degree.

Speaker 1:          00:25:47       And so, and the weird thing about Inez tens, it's like in the 80s when they were using them, I believe that's the right name for it, but uh, went in the 80s when they were using them, it was really, it had so much harsh high end. It was so crispy sounding and they said it was because of uh, yeah. Um, it's because of a coke usage and coke usage like creates a, basically brains tend to favor different sound frequencies under the influence of different drugs. And with coke they like the high end crispy sizzle. That was like hitting all the time and that was all amplified. So then when you hear eighties music, it tends to be, it's mixed, not all of it, but a great deal of it is mixed with a lot of like upper mid trouble minus crisp enos. That's kind of a, that totally makes sense.

Speaker 1:          00:26:35       That's what, you know, sometimes albums need to be remastered because of that. Wow. But, but that speaker is responsible. That's I, this is what I heard. So this is second hand information, but position that makes sense to you. Right. It does totally make sense to me. I mean, it's one of those subtleties that you may never think about, but then when you, you hear about it and you learn about it, it blows open a whole new way of thinking about things. Well, I don't know this, but that's what everybody has always said about the, the, the dead and LSD. Exactly. Yeah. That if you like the people that don't get the dead [inaudible] and I'm guilty of being one of those people. Yeah. I'm not a huge fan, but I respect them. It's because you haven't listened on LSD, a parent, Lee, according to people that I say, you listened to the dead on LSD and you're like, oh my God, I get it.

Speaker 1:          00:27:21       Oh, I see. I see. Interesting. It's, it's LSD music. Yeah. Yeah, totally. My cousin used to follow them around. Really? She followed it down for cod, I want to say a couple of years where she was on Twitter with selling bacon and eggs out of the car. She was total hippie. That's like a real super legit hippie that's kind of sick. That's rare. So I gotta talk to her about like the culture. It's like everyone's on acid. They're all doing. So many of them were doing ass trams. I would say every one of them, but it's like it's probably half, which is crazy for a concert. Imagine going to a concert and half the people were doing mushrooms like percent a hundred percent of the time, half the fee. I don't know if I'm that, if you're some pros we can all say that right now. Going to just don't have number.

Speaker 1:          00:28:08       I'm sorry. I'm just guessing. I think it's a, it's, it's a psychedelic inspired music that once you're under that psychedelic, apparently it makes sense. And this is not me talking from personal experience. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, it could be one of those things where, you know, there's like a photo that's slightly out of focus and then if you like bring in another, uh, or now better yet, like a code. It's like you get a picture of something and you're like, I don't can't, I can't tell him what it is. Abstract. And then you put this other layer on it and it completes it and you're like, oh, that's what it is. In a way. Like I can imagine that being true, but I can also say once you've experienced music that really ignites your imagination. If you hear music that sounds amazing on LSD, it should also sound amazing to you personally.

Speaker 1:          00:28:56       Not on it. How you can tell that it would be even more amazing if you were on LSD, but it already sounds great. It's like, to me, qualities like it exists in all states. So like it's just, uh, yeah. Anyways, that's kind of how I look at it. It's an interesting perspective. But you would think definitely the people see things differently when they're under, when they're under the influence of shootings. Absolutely. You, you don't think there can be like a tipping point? Oh, I think you're right. No, I, and to to your point, yes. I do think that there is music where you're like, I don't know man. And then you listen to it on mushrooms or whatever and you're like, oh fuck, this is dope. I remember the first day it does into to whole lot of love when I was high. Yeah. And you know that period there's a, in the middle of the song

Speaker 2:          00:29:42       where it's all just thimbles and fuck music, it's like Ah, ah, ah, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yes. God, Tim, I love that song. But when you listen that song high, you like these guys were wild. Oh yeah. I mean this is the 1970s right? And these guys made a song where it started off great. And then for a minute and a half it was just bones and fuck sounds shake from baby. I want to be your backdoor man. Hey. Oh, what? I was looking up to this LSD grateful dead thing. So their sound engineer who went under the name bear, which if you know anything about the grateful dead, they used the bears. He was one of the only scientists when LSD was out lost. I could still make it. Wow. That was the sound guy. Oh Jesus Christ. He made over 5 million doses, but in between 65 and 67 it says they had their own personal guy and he was the one that making the sound.

Speaker 2:          00:30:51       So if that guy still alive, man put him in jail for the rest of the, so they were strictly formatted for listening right here. Says he died in a car. Oh Australia. That's probably on the wrong side of the road because he was on acid. Let's just pause. Don't get mad. Oh, he's my hero. I just cry in jail. But that's amazing. So they have their own built in chemist. God, that must've been good to them. That's so cool. I love that because that's responsible. I think that that's the responsible thing to do your own chemist. That way you're not buying any nonsense. You're getting it from a guy who's a chemist. Yeah. This is your person that personally makes this stuff for you. You know where it comes from? Just Matt. How many people got busted at those concerts? The feds or the DEA ever crackdown?

Speaker 2:          00:31:37       Those concerts when I worked, I uh, you worked, you said you worked security at like a [inaudible]. Yeah, I did two for a summer and one of the concerts we did was for Phil as she's the Bass player of the grateful dead. And my job for that day was to walk around the parking lot and they would just yell at me and my buddy, we were 19 years old, six up six up that thought we were going to arrest everyone and they would try to give us the goofballs which have a bunch of drugs and I'm already to sort of dose this so that we'd leave everybody alone. What's a goofball? It's like a popcorn ball. But from what I was told, I've never had one bunch of psychedelics and all sorts of shit in it. Yeah, just like a thing you would eat. Oh my Jesus. Never heard of that. That's not what you were eating. Yeah. You just took a chance, just get too high. The first guy, the first guy who stumbled on mushrooms, I was like, what the fuck? Like mushrooms had to have been like relearned at some point in time they were like had to be some people that lived in an environment where there was no mushrooms, where people didn't get them and then someone found them somewhere but they didn't have any personal knowledge of what it was and tried it and ate it and tripped.

Speaker 1:          00:32:40       That had to have happened. Yeah, I mean I think, you know, it could, it could also be like, Hey, I'm foraging for Blah Blah Blah. And because arguably they would say mushrooms are around like way, way, way. Some people, you know, not so scientific perhaps, I don't know, or maybe scientific have surmised that may be consciousness or self awareness came from thes r species running into some kind of a psychedelic event which caused like this hyper self awareness loop or whatever and then deserves a lot of attention because people are so resistant to it. Like really rational, intelligent people are so resistant to it. And a, it's almost resistant to that concept of, well, yes, maybe, uh, our consciousness was somehow influenced by psychedelic, but to a man, almost to a man, all the, wow. I shouldn't say that even. I'm overstate over generalizing, but many of those people have not had psychedelic experiences that dismiss them so readily.

Speaker 1:          00:33:35       That's true. The people that have had psychedelic experiences that tend to be skeptical or more rational, they wouldn't, they're not going to have a definitive position on it. They're going to go, well, yeah. Right. Something to consider. It's more measured. Yeah. The hard liners, you know, there's a hardliners on both sides. The hardliners definitely believe that happened in the hardliners who believed that they don't have any positive effects whatsoever. Yeah, yeah, totally. I both almost equally foolish. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, that's a, that's what we're experiencing right now, but at least the people that have experienced it, they know what they're talking about. The people that haven't experienced it and don't think it's worth trying. Like, all right. Right. Like how do you know? Yeah, I know all these people are saying that it's amazing. And then it might be this literally the source of religion itself.

Speaker 1:          00:34:16       Some people when they've had it, they have these complete life changes where they just rethink things and want to be kinder to people in Nigeria. People want to just have more of a sense of community. Yeah. And then you're just, people dismiss that, but yet they'll take yoga seriously and meditation seriously, and they'll go to a therapist all the time and maybe they'll leave and get on antidepressants, maybe get on a little bit of Xanax. I'm having a little anxiety issues. Reggie Watts, and then they're scared of mushrooms. It's weird and interesting. Yeah, I mean I get, I get it and I, I dunno. Oh, I get it. But it's a flaw. Yeah, it is a fly. I mean it just, I guess if your job is to take in as many angles as possible to a problem or a situation or a concern or whatever way all of the things about all of it, and then come up with a solution based off of that.

Speaker 1:          00:35:05       But, and this isn't even encouraging anyone to do it, but this is just saying to dismiss it as being not important when you've never done it. It's nonsense. Yeah. That's all I'm saying. That's what I'm saying. It's like I'm not saying you should do it. I don't think. I know a lot of people that birth to grave have done no psychedelics and they're great and they're wonderful people now life and they had a wonderful experience. It's not an prerequisite. It's not a necessary thing. No, I agree with, I haven't had it. You might want to shut the fuck up. Yeah. If you're speaking on the issue. Yeah. Shut the fuck up. I was like, well the research shows like, oh, you're going to let the research show you what the experience, let me tell you about the research. Five dried grams in silent darkness as turns mechanic would describe Oh and prescribed.

Speaker 1:          00:35:47       Yeah. Do that. Oh my gosh. Do that. And then we'll talk. Yeah. You know, just have one quick DMT trip and then we'll talk, cause there's no way that, I think it would be difficult. I'm sure there's someone who has done psychedelics and has and still says no. Sure. Yeah. Yeah. But I would say that most people they would understand it at least maybe they didn't have a great time, but they would at least understand the power of that experience. I think some people have the burden of intelligence. And what I mean by that is that they're really smart and they see a lot of people around them that are silly and they experienced that so often that they get weary and they get, they get, you know, they sort of get rigid in their belief that their opinions are correct because they dismiss most of the people that are around them.

Speaker 1:          00:36:37       Cause you're on a bunch of dummies if you're really smart guy or smart girl, it's hard. It's hard to maintain a good perception of what things are and what things aren't. When you're the smartest person in the room, you kinda never want to be the smartest person in the room. Yeah. And also, yes. And also believing that you are in a way excludes you from including other people who are also smarter than everybody in the room. Well, it's only men, maybe not even smarter, which, but I know you're saying it by an ideology, their perspective isn't dimmed, right? Yeah. Yes. They see things clearly, which is I think one of the most underrated forms of intelligence. Like there's all this intelligence in solving mathematical problems and yeah, right. Social Intelligence. But there's, there's, there's a bunch of different kinds of intelligence. Absolutely. Able to see through the bullshit is an intelligence and some people just don't have it yet.

Speaker 1:          00:37:27       No, absolutely. And I think that, you know, at the same time wanting to help someone see that angle is also an important thing. So if you're like a, if you're someone who's like, Oh shit, like let's say it's this, maybe you're, maybe you're trained in tactical awareness and you, uh, I just have a different way of being in a room where you sit. Sure. Think about all that stuff and the situation arises where like potentially something dangerous could happen or whatever. Uh, then being able to explain that idea and that type of awareness so that someone can see that is also possible. Like sharing it. They may not get it to the extent that you do, but they, at least you've included it in their viewpoint. Yeah. Maybe, well, people that are soldiers, they do have a weird women. Men are in the room. It's insane. My friend Andy Stump, he's, uh, always sneaking up on me. He says, you got no situational awareness. Yeah, yeah. When a crowd like, what am I supposed to do? Just constantly on three 60 looking for danger. I mean, yeah, that's what he's saying, what he's saying. So, but that's because he was a seal. You know

Speaker 2:          00:38:36       how they look at, they look at things a whole lot different. So how you stay alive. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. I think one of the things that's super important for people to recognize and it helps them open their mind up to other opinions is that even if they failed themselves very highly, um, the, that competitive thing of comparing your intellect and your reason to other people, it's a very limiting step. Instead of worrying about yourself. If you're smart, just be smart. Appreciate other intelligences. If it just, just get into talking to them. This is, that's my thoughts on it. Instead of being competitive with them, get in to trying to find out how they they work cause there's a lot of different humans on this planet and we have this egocentric position almost everybody does that. They're at least better at one thing than other people are or they know some more about one thing that other people do and it's a weird competitive thing that people get involved with.

Speaker 2:          00:39:24       It's, it's stupid like you should recognize that it's awesome to have cool people around you that are like really smart and interested in weird shit and intelligent and inspiring. You almost envy their, their creativity. Those are massively important people to have in your life. But when people get, they feel weird about comparing themselves to the other person because they come up [inaudible] insecurity. Exactly. That's where like you see that with a lot of guys guys puff up chest and start comparing like how much their houses cost. Like so like, like literally doing stuff that you're like, oh we're still doing this. Like to my mind I'm like, Oh shit, you guys aren't aware of it. Like a way that I bet anyways. Yeah. That kind of thing. You guys are doing some 1990 shit here. Yeah. Cause it's like, I know cause like either they're like doing an act, which I'm always hoping and I'm always hoping that that's why there's disbelief when it really is what it is.

Speaker 2:          00:40:23       And I'm like, Oh shit. Oh that's best for real. That's actually the thing. It's weird, right? Yeah, it is a little, it's a little weird. I mean some people have a lack of cool people around them too. That's a real problem. Yes. Stuck in a shoe. It's like a good tomato plant is not going to grow in the fucking Sonora desert. All right. There's no nutrients there. It's too bright. It's the sun's too hot. It's not the right climate. Right? Yes. If you're stuck in some fucking shit hole city and it's just your whole neighborhoods fill with dummies and there's no prospects and his fucking lead in the water yet Flint, Michigan water, you're drinking there still haven't fixed that. No. People drink bottled water in Flint, Michigan in 2019. Yep. Like how, how would do they not have, how did they let that ever get to that point? Like at all the things you need. Well, what do we need to stay alive? Number one water. Okay, let's ignore that. Let's ignore that and work on the cracks in the streets. Let's ignore that and have new uh, traffic lights that, uh, have cameras on them to bust you so we can get more revenue. Let's make sure we hire Parkington. What about the water? We can get to that. We'll get to that low water. Well, it's, it's my new

Speaker 3:          00:41:34       phrase for, uh, you know, our situation cause capitalism cause the current version of capitalism.

Speaker 2:          00:41:41       I said capitalism, I don't even know enough about economics. I mean, I, it's not really, it's more just like a philosophical, but you have capitalism with regulation so that you make sure that there's no pollution. You make sure that you yes, don't correlate with environmental disasters course and aren't we also going on the fucking momentum of decisions that were made a long time ago. Like a lot of this stuff, like a lot of these mines that pollute everywhere up pollute environments wherever they are. They kind of made those when environment where my environmental laws were different. Right?

Speaker 3:          00:42:17       Yeah, for sure. I mean environmentalism was, it wasn't really a thing until like the mid 19 hundreds I guess. So like, like Roosevelt like was like a huge like environmental groovy dude. But uh, the idea of preserving swaths of land and like considering the environment when growing an economy simultaneously like that just a, that just stopped. Like there's like some national parks stuff and maybe some things pass with like ozone, some led stuff, some mercury stuff, you know, kind of common sense, really hardcore shit that should definitely like no brainers. Those have been done. But anything else, making sure that that balance is there. As the economy grows, it just doesn't exist. It's just the way capitalism is right now. It's like, it doesn't, that's not considered a value. There's the more, in fact, the more scarce it becomes, the higher end value it is. So it's so, it's in it's own best interest to continue to grow and grow and grow until it can't grow anymore. Jeez man. So, so that's why decisions like that are made in my, in my mind,

Speaker 2:          00:43:25       well, decisions that impact the wilderness and impact in the environment. Like did you ever see that movie gas land? No. Great document around fracking. Oh Wow. Really crazy. Um, what does the director Sam, Josh Fox Rolan no, he shares a different guy bro. No, there's no way. No, it's a different guy. No, no way. But it's an amazing documentary. And Josh Fox. I did, I got it. Josh Fox. Um, it's really good. Really, really good documentary into is Josh Fox. He's a guy who made the film. He and he was inspired by a personal experience with a, wasn't it? Do you remember the actual story, Jamie? It's like personal experience with some pollutants or something like that in the river, but got anyway, anyway, made this amazing documentary and watching people dismiss some of this stuff. That documentary was so, so surreal. Oh yeah. They were lighting their tap water on fire and I don't know if you saw that.

Speaker 2:          00:44:24       I did see that. Yeah, and that's crazy. People literally were saying you could do that before the fracking. That's not, it's not because of the, wow. People were saying that like, okay, let's assume that's true. Let's just get crazy in as soon as true fucking water is on fire. That's the last shit that should be on fire is the shit they used to put out fire. If your God water's on fire. Yeah. Do you know how much shit has to be in your water for it to be on fire? Okay, what's going on here and why are you so sure that this didn't come from fracking and that you could always let your water on fire and now you're telling us you use it and make videos about this. Before, before there was a fracking thing. Yes. Showing me a video that has that. See, are you sure?

Speaker 2:          00:45:04       Are you really sure that there's, have you tested the water? You a fucking scientist, you sitting over there with a lab coat and a fucking check sheet making sure that the toxin levels are exactly the same before and after fracking. No, you're not, but why are you so interested? There's a thing that people do with, they're like really interested in the interest of big business and they want to like they guess and regular people who don't even have a financial stake in that business will make up excuses for the business. I know. It's crazy. Yeah. What is that? It's fear. It's just fear of losing jobs. Like people like losing jobs or losing the thing that keeps their, their bills paid. It's also like that no nonsense, right wing mindset. There's like a no nonsense right-wing mindset. All these fucking tree huggers, Goddamn tree huggers.

Speaker 2:          00:45:47       Oh yeah. Stop us from making a good living. You want those people to be poor. You want those people to, you ever see the look on a poor coal Meyer's face? Yeah. You know what I mean? There's that thing that they do no nonsense. So they want to go with anything that's like good for the economy but bad for the environment, which is crazy. It's because you never find it. You have to factor in the other the additional costs and how much can it cost to fix what you did and if you ever can fix what you did and if you can't fix what you did to the environment, how much should that cost? Cause if you can, if you decide like, Hey, I'm gonna pull copper out of this fucking hole in the ground, but it might kill a million salmon. Like you imagine how much a million salmon would be worth.

Speaker 2:          00:46:26       You're going to kill a whole population of Salmon. How much is that worth? Like give you ruined fishing for all the people that want to come to this one. Salmon River. Yeah. You kill a million fish. Like how much is that worth? That's, that should be worth $1 billion. Yeah, you should get fined $1 billion if not more. Yeah. You can't even fix that. That's what I, that's what I'm saying. That's, that's what that, that value that it has no value. These, it's also what's ours like poisoning is our stuff. I know. That's what I mean. It's like the earth. This is the worst because it's like it does not, it's just a nut. It's not a part of the equation for growing the economy. That's like, and I know there's going to be people listening that are like, just know about this shit hardcore. I'm just approaching it from like an over kind of philosophical, energetic viewpoint.

Speaker 2:          00:47:09       Right, right, right. We're being hippies. Yeah. We're being like kind of, I don't know, Weirdo. Don't even know what the fuck we're saying. We're stone Zers. So, have you ever seen some of the image of the mining that they do, the images of the mining that they do in northern Canada? Like Northern Alberta? No dude, it's like some hellscape shit. It's crazy cause it like there's a giant industry of oil mining up there and all kinds of mining in northern Canada. A lot of folks that go up there and they do shifts but I mean you're talking unbelievably, brutally, ruthlessly cold. Occasionally people get jacked by bears. Like really? They live in, they're living with monsters just outside the gates and some fucking night's watch type deal where they're trying to suck oil out of the ground. And I mean there's so much of it up there and it's such a big part of the economy that you have these giant like aerial views of these, this, these places that are just fucks Ville.

Speaker 2:          00:48:05       Uh Wow man. There's one of them. The one that I saw was much more horrific cause it involves a lake. So what does it say? Photos, fame photographer, Alex Mclean's, new photo of Canada's oil sands are shocking. Yeah. I mean it's creepy. It's, I mean, but there was nothing there anyway. The idea is like, hey, if it's just flat like that or it's ugly because we have holes in it, an oil coming out of the whole who gives a shit? No one's up here. Right. I get it. I get that mindset. We've got jobs. Everyone has jobs and it's true. It's a great job to have. They make a lot of money. You meet those dudes that come to a lot of shows when you do in Canada, they have a name for them. Like look, real rich oil worker. Yeah. It's royal. It's real, real rich oil worker fellows. That's the nickname drilling these giants. That's one that I saw when see the water all fucked up. It's all filled with oil and shit. Oh my lords. Yeah. That's a, that's a water man.

Speaker 2:          00:49:00       The waters. Fuck. Wow. Yeah. Yeah. It's, it's, it's funny. All of the, all of the issues that, all of the imbalances are completely solvable. There's like, there is no deficits. We don't have a deficit, um, in what it would take to just make good decisions that make life really nice for most people on the planet. I think a lot of managing has to be done because there's a lot of stuff that has unintended consequences and moving pieces. In fact, all the moving pieces around them. Of course. I think that's one of the things that people are really bad at predicting. This is why I was saying like, yeah, you know, how much is it worth to be able to get copper out of a hole in the ground? It's going to poison a river and kill a bunch of fish. How much is that worth?

Speaker 2:          00:49:43       Yeah. Yeah. It's like these people have this sense that like you make one decision and it only affects that thing, but it doesn't affects a lot of things or connected to that thing. It also affects the way people feel. If you do something Shitty, like kill a million fish, people get bummed out. Like that's real. It affects the way they interact with other people. Yeah. You know, when you read something really fucked up on the news, you're like, God damn it. Until you leave your house like that, you leave your house like God damn it to people that have that God damn it. And then they, they get upset at each other for something that wouldn't before. Yeah. Cause they're just thinking there's a bunch of pedophiles out there and a bunch of monsters and a bunch of murderers and a bunch of people pouring oil into the ocean. Yeah. No, it's a bummer. Changes

Speaker 1:          00:50:28       when people do fucked up things. It changes how we feel about people. 100%. And I dunno, I get, uh, I dunno, it's, I try to get that to get overwhelmed by those things. But, you know, it's like really the best thing, at least in my life that I try to do is make friends with as many technologists and designers and people of that ilk, um, to be able to at least be a part of the conversation. Cause they're at the, they're like that the head of the wave, like there's, there's nothing really in front of them. They're just on that, like, you know, whatever, bleeding edge or whatever. But it's just like that the place where chaos is being ordered and like the decisions are being made, which waves are, we're going to do that. And if you can have good conversations with people like that, you can kind of, I believe you can kind of help steer things at least technologically to uh, allocate funds to different portions of technology that are, it should be more prioritized than that than they are.

Speaker 1:          00:51:23       Like, like just a figuring out things like accumulating water, um, out of, out of the air, like more of that should be used or reducing carbon emissions. All the various things you can do for that. Um, you know, uh, try to close that gap between the ultra ultra, ultra, ultra rich and the poor. It's like everyone can still be super happy if everyone, if everyone had access to be able to level up to a point that's ridiculous. That can still happen, but not at the levels that they are, but he's not in. Interesting that that instinct that people have to resist that idea that poor people shouldn't be somehow or another, we should engineer a way to have less poor people that we should consider it as a problem, but people get really resistant to that. Right? You start thinking, oh no, no. What do you want to do?

Speaker 1:          00:52:06       You want to take my fucking money and give it to jumble? I know I was. No, I dragged my money buckets. Socialist Jug in my mind. Yeah. It's like, well, he didn't work for it, so he didn't find the right way to work inside of the system, so there's a failure. I'm sorry, I don't think they're right. I don't think they're wrong about the whole concept of not giving people money doesn't solve a problem. No, he doesn't solve a problem. But recognizing that it's a problem and engineering it so that we have a a better society where more people are doing good. That's great for everybody. Totally. It's great for the economy. It's a weird caste system thing where people who are really poor, you almost want them to stay really poor. Yeah. You don't want to, I don't get it. It's a weird devil get it.

Speaker 1:          00:52:47       I'm like, cause I feel uncomfortable if I'm in a room of people and I feel like someone's being kind of just looked over consistently. That's the person I'm going to engage with the most. You're a great guy. That's awesome. But it's the, you are the, I mean that's a good way of looking at it. I mean cause it's it and then also it's just like, well thanks. But it's, but it's also just a practical thing, right? I mean, I mean, if you're sensitive to that as that, if that's part of your value system is to feel like, you know, not everybody should be doing this or this or that or that, but everybody is entitled to be recognized and respected for that. And so that's kind of a cool place to operate from. But I guess what I'm relating to economically, yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:53:26       If more people are doing well, then you, then you have a very productive society. Right? So there are no drags on it. Like there's a lot dragging this, this economy. Sure. It's just like crime and poverty is getting gum drug addicts. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:53:39       And a lot of drug addicts come from abuse. Yeah. A lot of abuse comes from poverty. There's a lot, a lot of those factors that play in there that make us a weaker country. That's how I just you like if you really patriotic, he'd want to fix all of the impoverished neighborhoods. But yes, if we're a team, the team is stronger when there's less losers, right. When people are not losing in life. Well, people are losing because they're stuck in a spot where they can almost never get out. And by the time they're 18 they've already been in jail twice and they're kind of programmed by their environment to be hostile because the world around you is harsh and nasty and doesn't give a fuck about you, but you have to adapt to survive. I mean, that's how people are able to kill people in war.

Speaker 2:          00:54:17       People have a remarkable ability to adapt, but the idea that they should be able to figure that out when you didn't have, that's crazy. It's crazy. It's such a bad hand. You have the worst hand of cards ever. Yeah, and they're us. We're all on a team. Like if you really say you're American, I'm American man. I'll fucking support this country. This country is everybody, man. Everybody, everybody. I forget it. Let's leave. Let's see. Just for convenience sake, let's leave out illegals and only say the poor people that were born here that are registered United States citizens. We got work to do. Oh yeah, we got work to do.

Speaker 3:          00:54:52       It's, it's, it's just insane to me. I mean, I see it and I'm like, ah fuck man, that shouldn't be a thing. But, but I see why, you know, it's like you're talking about there's this weird biological human instinct to create a tiered system of society because that's the way you control society. It's like creating a transmission. Looks like a social transmission. And like that is, we were sitting, we were looking on it. Yeah. Cause it's like that way you can manipulate, you can like switch gears and you can play, you can play them off of one another. And, and you know, and I think like some conspiracy thinking shit just went deep.

Speaker 3:          00:55:31       I'm like, what is he writing this writer? Is it convenient? Is it just convenient that people want to keep it's crabs in a bucket? You know that expression. Yeah. Crabs never get out of the bucket because the other crabs grab them, drag them down. Yeah. It's true. It's, I mean it's, yeah, it's predicting human behavior, you know, to a certain extent. And a lot of the leftover monkey stuff. Yeah. Man. It's the, it's not, it's just, it's still here. It's still here and it's fucking shit up. That's what we also needed it just a hundred years ago. Totally. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:55:59       People were doing duals when they were, the president was doing duels just a couple hundred years ago. Yeah, you're right. This is so recent. Yeah. I mean Barrick shit man. Shooting each other with little mini muskets in the fucking street, the front of everybody. And you were the president. Is that true? Was there a president that had gotten a duel? That is true. Right? I think you're right. That up as Andrew Jackson got in like over a hundred goals. I think that like what duals, where it like that

Speaker 1:          00:56:24       dual type to, it was really just like a challenge to see you if you would show up really. And then like, oh, it was like just a, it wasn't really a goal. It's like someone died at every shoot. Anybody he did. But I think like one person. Oh Oh. Cause usually they have a crazy story about it. They don't aim at each other. That's why. That's why I heard that there's like you kind of like aim near them. Something like that. Yeah. And that was a way to concede in one day he got shot I think in the chest, but he was such a bad ass. He, he stayed, he like put his hand over it and held it and s and s cause his gun jammed when he was supposed to fire. So the other guy got him and then he fixed his gun and shot the guy in the head and that guy ended up, I'm pretty sure that's how that stuff too, the way I went about like the one guy who killed town, she, you have a real motivation to kill a guy when shoots in the chest that should eliminate threat.

Speaker 1:          00:57:09       Now this becomes real and the guy just has to stand there and can't even run away. So goofy is that you have to stand there and let a dude shoot you. That's part of the deal, right? I don't turn around and go, you can't be like, I went, bitch, I'm out of here. You have to kind of stand. There is a guy named Charles Dickinson, not the writer, but a horse, a rival horse breeder, and here's the account of their drop.

Speaker 2:          00:57:35       That was on May 30th, 1806 Jackson and Dickinson met at Harrison's mills on the Red River in Logan, Kentucky at the first signal. From there seconds, Dickinson fired. Jackson received Dickinson's first bullet in the chest next to his heart. Jackson put his hand over the wound to staunch the flow of blood and stayed standing long enough to fire his gun. Dickinson seconds claimed that Jackson's first shot misfired which would have meant that the wool was over, but in a breach of etiquette, Jackson re cocked the gun and shot again this time killing his opponent. Although Jackson recovered, he suffered chronic pain from the wound for the remainder of his life. Ah, Dang. Jackson was not prosecuted for murder and that dual had very little effect on a successful campaign for the presidency in 1829 many American men in the early 18 hundreds particularly in the south, viewed dueling as a time honored tradition.

Speaker 1:          00:58:28       Wow. That was just a couple of years ago. We were barbarians and like, well, sometimes you just got to do it. That is a time honored tradition. 200 years ago, people were so goddamn crazy that you could shoot someone in the fucking face in a dual a street fight and then run for president and win. Yeah. That's consent. Consensual. I mean, there are versions of that now. That's amazing. But yeah, his divorce rate raise more of a scandal than him killing that guy. Wow. How is that possible? Wow. I mean again, priorities, different societies. Yeah. What was gossip like back then? Like gossip magazines and have like a like hand printed newspaper with gossip at that they would hand out. Yeah. What would it, why would his divorce become a big deal out there? The printing press back then, right? Oh yeah, for sure. Yeah. The United States. Got It. There's an 1856 now. Um, like everyone had to buy into it. People are so that just a couple hundred years ago

Speaker 2:          00:59:23       there were so goofy. I mean, that's one of the best examples of like a difference in a shift in culture. I imagine hearing that today. Imagine hearing that we had slid so far down that Trump and Putin were engaging in a duel and they were going to go back to back and trauma cheated and shot them. And we were, yeah, I wonder who would cheat who? Well, if that happened, if Trump Trump took a bullet, but his gun misfired and then he re cocked it and fire again. Oh, that would be a Trump thing. That's what, but that's what he did. That's what Jackson did. Oh my goodness. Jackson. Yeah. Yeah, though. Okay. So he married Rachel Jackson, who, this is part of the dual because a, the guy who killed Dickinson had publicly called her a big amiss because she married Jackson, not knowing her first husband had fought, not finalized the divorce or something like that.

Speaker 2:          01:00:09       So that was a bigger scandal that he was married to some already married woman. Oh. Like that got outed. So he's like, fuck you, I'm gonna kill you. Oh my goodness. Wow. So he challenged to him to a duel because Jackson challenged him to do that. And I'll read N***a horse, Betty said, oh my God. Oh, you can cheat on horse bedding. That's, those are two big things, man. Don't say I'm a man's wife, is a big mist. Then you don't say that's what they're shooting people over fucking horse bets and Shit. Yeah. Those were barbarian people and this our ancestors just 200 years ago. This is like very civil, civil, barbarian, civil Barbera whereby bearings with their rules. Well that's one of the more hilarious stories of the Revolutionary War, right? The way the British soldiers dressed was so silly. They literally put a target on their fucking chest.

Speaker 2:          01:01:02       They made their vitals lighter. It made like if you, you shoot guns, you know what it's like. You can see if you could see things clearly, it makes a much more viable target. Yes. Period. Yeah. And you're talking about people that didn't have any sights on their guns aren't right. In terms of optics, obviously they had like little machine sites, little metal sites, but the way these guys walk towards them, especially the ones with the xs on the chest, that shit is so ridiculous. They're walking bulls. Odds is the dumbest thing. Wow. And the only thing that makes sense to me is that they had just had it easy for too long. Not, not even easy, but they were in control for too long. They got, they got a little silly. You forgot how barbaric people can be really thinking about fashion. Well that's the weirdest fashion, right?

Speaker 2:          01:01:48       Like that was what they used for wartime. Like this is really what the professionals, you know what I mean? Like soldiers looked a little bit more like, hey guys, we're a professional soldiers and we're, it doesn't look like good clothes for fucking people up in. No, it looks cool. Yeah. But what a weird outfit. Right? That militarily weird. How much hand to hand combat were they doing? Cause they didn't, there wasn't a lot of swords. It's was just jerking each other off. That's all they did. They just got in the woods and if they knew any Jujitsu, they call it, be great. Someone could choke everyone out with that, with those outfits. Yeah. All that clothing doesn't move good too. I mean, I'm just guessing, but I think they're fucking cloth. It was probably dog shit back then. Yeah, probably real stiff, hard to move around and it's just a weird outfit.

Speaker 2:          01:02:36       It's not like something that you would, if you had to run through the woods and fire a gun, you want to wear it with like soldiers wear today and you want to be able to blend in, but it's just so strange that that wasn't even a concern back then. They had knee high leggings or weird shoes. Wars were more like chess, like every, like the soldiers and all the different rank and file. They're all like pieces on a chess board, so it's all about strategy, you know? It's like, we'll line our men up this way and we'll do this and blah, blah, blah, blah. That's it. It's more like that's how battles are being organized. It's like chess games. You want to know how God before he got gorilla, right, right, right. Well, it was gorilla at first and then it became true. Mongolia, daisy, we're lighting people on fire and ms catapults.

Speaker 2:          01:03:17       Yeah, by any means necessary war. Those shoes did not have tread. They'd had invented tread on shoes yet. That's why a few people are, yes. They had leather shoes. So the soles were leather. So they were scuffed up, but there was no tread. I bet you some soldiers like figured out how they wrapped, you know, like sunken leather and wrapped layers. You know, I'm around the foot. So to create traction. Yeah. Cause if you think like you take like a trail running shoe and a, if you ever wear like a, like a Solomon speed cross trailing, she loves us. Yeah. They're great. They have these big divots in the bottom. You can really dig into the dirt with those things. Yeah. If you had to compare yourself running up a hill in cowboy boots that have that flat leather smooth, slippery surface versus you would fall on your fucking face.

Speaker 2:          01:04:05       Yeah. There's no way you'd have any confidence. Yeah, I have that. Nothing but those Solomons you just dig in and go, it gives you a totally false perception of re like I have, um, those Vibram five finger running shoes. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. And uh, I run in the trail ones, which have like a good amount of treading it. But one day I tried to run in the ones that aren't trail ones, they're, they're basically just for the gym and it's super thin. There was no tread at all. I was falling on my fucking face. My legs would just go, whoops, just kick out going up hills. Your legs just go. Woopsies no tread at all. It's just slippery. I can imagine that you need, like if you're running up a stiff hill, you need defense. You know you need something that's going to even have that bad gun.

Speaker 2:          01:04:47       They just had leather defined tread. I sort of found a shoe, I think it says it was from the revolutionary war, but it doesn't show the trend. It's just a fucking old piece of leather. Something don't tread on me there. That was their shoes back then. Bullshit ass shoes. But the bottom was just fucking leather. I mean when did, when they figured out like Vibram leather soles, you know, I mean rubber soles with figured out how to get those like fic d Troggs slave shoes some of our time. So yeah, those are, those are clogs. Wow. Basically they just borrowed that touch technology. Yeah. Wouldn't choose fuck that. Look at those things. Wow. Dude, this is a couple of hundred years ago. People would just take animal skin off and chop it up and put it on their body. I love it. That's how people stayed alive, like how they figured out wood and leather.

Speaker 2:          01:05:41       I wonder who the first fucking monkey was to figure out how to skin an animal and where it's skin. You know? It has to be like in the monkey days right now it feels like it'd be a couple generations away from the monkey. Maybe it's don't you think maybe it was one, I just can't imagine a monkey doing one mean motherfucking chimp and they were going north and there's one dude who always annoyed him, so he kills him with a rock and then uses the rock to take his fucking skin off and wears it to freak everybody else out. But then he realizes it makes him warm. You didn't go a little further north, Huh? It's like a movie. Okay. I like it. A movie. Can you see that scene? I can see that, that, that, that's like, that's what the entire movie leads up to.

Speaker 2:          01:06:24       And the first monkey figured out he could kill an animal with like a tool, like the, for like Australia pithy kiss or one of those, Oh yeah. Primitive humans. When the first one was that stabbed something like a stab at or rat or a rabbit with a stick and went, Holy Shit. Right. I can just use this tool. What other tools? How are you going to start eating? Yeah, I'm going to eat good. Cause if you didn't have a weapon, how hard is it for our person to kill something with your hands? What are you even gonna get? What are you going to catch? What the fuck can you catch with your hands? Well, you can't catch a squirrel. You'd be just your hands. No tools. You'd be hunting and gathering. Mostly. I mean, I mean gathering, I would say, yeah, you beat and Shit that you found on the ground.

Speaker 2:          01:07:08       Yeah. That's primarily what you would eat. And then once in a while you'd get something, an animal, but, but yeah, but then, yeah, you're right. Uh, they obviously had to figure out different ways of getting animals. Well, it's one of the shifts that they think took place to allow the human brain size to double over a period of 2 million years. Don't really human brain size apparently. Um, I was listening to a Terence Mckenna lecture on this once and he was talking about all the human brain size doubled over the period of 2 million years is one of the biggest mysteries in the fossil record. And his idea was that they discovered mushrooms and that the chimps over this period of time where the monkey people, whatever the fuck they were ancient hominids had discovered mushrooms after the climate had shifted and he backs it up. He did back it up, believes he's dead now.

Speaker 2:          01:07:55       He backed it up with, um, some climate data that we know from, you know, core samples and stuff like that. He thinks that they experienced climate change where the rain forest had receded in the grasslands and that this gave birth to the rise of undulates like cows and you know, deer and things like that. Yeah. And they would shit these mushrooms grow on their a shit. And then they've observed a lot of these monkeys in the wild picking up cow patties and looking for grubs and beetles underneath it. Oh, I see. I think they might've experimented with the mushrooms and that if they experimented with siliciden mushrooms, a lot of things could take place once they realized that it was not just a viable food source, but also provided them with a bunch of different benefits. One being their vision and increased visual acuity note, especially in low doses.

Speaker 2:          01:08:45       Yeah. So I'm going to make them see things better to make some hornier make some more communal and it makes them more creative and all those things possibly could have given birth to the, to, to language and to a lot of other things. They also think it's possible that that creativity could have enabled them to start hunting, that they started using tools and you and thinking and trying to figure out ways around stuff and trying to, you know, try to figure out how to make a, an effective weapon to kill something in the distance. Like the more they're thinking and becoming creative, the more that that stuff's enhancing them. And this, this period of 2 million years is like a pretty profound jump for the human brain size. They think some of that also came to do with our desire to kill things with, with weapons, but once we started hunting and eating meat, we got way more protein, more bioavailable protein, or it was healthier for the animal, for the human animal. And then we also started to try to figure out other better ways to kill these animals, which made us even more creative and competitive. Yeah. Yeah. They think that all these, these, all these factors might've taken place. That turned us into a person

Speaker 1:          01:09:51       that's pretty amazing. 2 million years. Yeah. It's just like a deviation. Well, you know, it's even crazier. 65 million years ago. We were like a mole. Oh yeah. People were like a little shrew or ancest. That's right. I remember that. What's the name of that thing? Oh no man. I think it's North Korea. Fifth [inaudible] North Gustav versus, I think you're right. A Pisco for Christmas district. It was like a weird little mole screw specific with this. That's what it is. Yeah. It's the little tiny rodent. Yeah. Cause I did a podcast or now I toured with, um, what is it Jamie? Oh, there it is. I don't know

Speaker 2:          01:10:33       the earliest of, what does that word you thery in you? Therian mammals was a small rat like creature depicted in this illustration that lived 145 million years ago. Wow. In the shadow of the dinosaurs. So that rat like creature apparently survived the earthquake or the asteroid impact. I don't think that's the thing though.

Speaker 1:          01:10:53       And it's, there's another, there's a formal name for it. I, I know because I was on a podcast and they were the one of the segments of it. They talked about this thing.

Speaker 2:          01:11:01       This is, but they don't, the only way, reason why I'm skeptical is because it says 145 million years ago, but I guess maybe they survived the impact screw. Scroll back up to the top of the title says these rodent like creatures are the earliest known of humans, whales

Speaker 1:          01:11:14       and truce. Oh, okay. That's what's even more crazy. Like we used to be a whale. It's like, or our ancestor, we shared a common ancestor, I should say. Yeah, we like went into the sea and then, yeah, on land. That thing, that fucking rat became a whale. What? Maybe that's it with area there. There it is. Okay. [inaudible] that turned into a person. Folks, think about that. When you sat in your rat traps and a hundred million years from now, rats might be some super superior human form. I think that's very possible. But I mean that, I get why Christians are skeptical now. I'm like, what? What do you show me your work? God May this, God didn't, I was not a rat. I was not a rat, sir. Yeah, I just appeared. But in essence, here's the, here's a way to it to kind of maybe justify that argument.

Speaker 1:          01:12:00       It's like, let's say the mushroom thing is true, right? So in essence, humans became humans with the, uh, intervention, if you will, of a natural psychedelic substance, which then expanded the mind and enabled the growth of that. My, the acceleration of intelligence, self-awareness, like, like lightspeed and so in essence like God created man or whatever you like that idea. It's like, well in essence it is the unit. If you can think of God is the universe or whatever. That's one way thinking of it, God, collective consciousness, whatever you want to call it. Like that, that intervention or the, the ability to see or sense that expansiveness of that collective intelligence could be attributed to God. So therefore you could say, well, I was never a blow. It's like, well yeah, you are from that. But what created you was something more cosmic. So, and if, if that's even true.

Speaker 1:          01:12:59       Well, I was reading a quote today from someone was mocking from Piers Morgan. We was talking about the unit, like atheists and not knowing what happened before the Big Bang, not knowing how no one has any answer for what happened before the Big Bang and about how this made sense to him. That um, this is, I think the way he was saying it was, uh, somehow or another it was evidence or at least in his eyes, something more superior. Oh, here it is. No atheist can never say what was there before. The Big Bang. They just say nothing and they can't explain what nothing actually is. No human brain can. Which is why I believe in something that has superior powers to the human brain. Well that makes sense that there's definitely, oh, Brian Cox went after his ass. What? Brian Cox, if you mean the hot big bang, than there may be a period of rapid expansion known as inflation. This theory is able to account for the observe features of the universe, including cutting the CMB power spectrum and the flatness and horizon problems. I love it. Cox just came at him with the science. I love it. I always to do it. I know what he's trying to say. What Morgan is trying to say

Speaker 2:          01:14:12       and the EAS. He's right that no one has an answer as to like why this thing became, why the big bang happened. It's a w this is an interesting quote by this guy we were talking about, forget who it was. I wish I could remember, but he was talking about how people have, it might've been mckenna have so much faith in science and so little faith in mystical things, but yet science revolves on one initial theory where magic took place, where everything came out of nothing, that it was smaller than the head of a pencil. Everything you see in the observable universe, including planes, trains and automobiles, all of it had to have had an origin in the most spectacular sorcery the world has ever known. Like it is all dependent upon magic. So he wasn't, he wasn't saying that, you know, ridiculous ideological ideas of the start and birth and death of the universe are fact.

Speaker 2:          01:15:09       But he was saying that, look, look, the fact according to scientists is that all evidence points to this whole thing coming out of nothing. This whole thing, this whole thing existing out of nowhere. And with Piers Morgan is I think is saying is that that gives birth, that, that that gives proof to something superior to the human brain, which for sure it does. Well, yes, he, we are at this, this is Terrence. We kind of, we were asked by science to believe that the entire universe sprang from nothingness and at a single point, and for no discernible reason. This notion is the limit case for credulity. In other words, if you can believe this, you can believe anything. Well, I think I said it, I said it in a paraphrase like away. That's basically the same thing. He's, I'm just saying it's all nuts, man.

Speaker 3:          01:15:56       Yeah, I mean it, my, my thing is like, I think I like to think of it as in simulation terms, in, in, in the sense that if thinking of like reality and the way it's perceived and the way that we weave through it as kind of a designed game of, of sorts. And so if I think of it in that way, like nothing and something, nothing in something that's just kind of, that's the core of our reality, right? We live in a binary reality. Everything is a complex assortment of binaries that add up into a really complex system in a way. So what do you think it's moving towards? Well, think about that. Well that's, that's the thing. I think that part of the rules or what makes it hard to rationalize like nothingness or, uh, or something very, very fantastic is just because it, because it's binary. We are binary in our thought process. So it's hard for us to not think of things in a binary way. So we think other was the beginning. No, there was an ending. There was a beginning. There's an ending. But really it's infinite. It's like it's paradox, right? It's everything and nothing simultaneously and, and the absence of which, but, but I guess what I'm saying is that the idea that things are infinite,

Speaker 1:          01:17:10       that reality is infinite is kind of a good way, but kind of can be scary, but a good way to think of it because it doesn't make any sense why it wouldn't be, it seems like we have a limited way of viewing what reality is and I think we're limited by our binary thought processes, I guess. Well, it's also interesting that we want to put any sort of limitations on the universe in that. Yeah. It's immense size isn't crazy enough for us. Yeah. You know what I mean? I know we can look at what we know, if we know that the universe has hundreds of billions of galaxies, like just there's a bunch of competing theories as to what happens, you know, with black holes and whether or not there's multi verses. There's a bunch of yes, right? But the one of the most profound ones that it was ever explained to me is that there's a supermassive black hole in the center of every galaxy, and it's exactly that.

Speaker 1:          01:18:03       I think one half of 1% of the mass, the entire galaxy. Oh really? It works out that the bigger galaxies have bigger supermassive black holes. And the concept is that it's, there is a real possibility that going through that black hole, you would encounter an entirely different universe with hundreds of billions of galaxies. Each galaxy have a black hole in the center of it. Go through that black hole, an entirely different universe. So each one, yes, universe, when you have hundreds of billions of galaxies, there is hundreds of billions of universes through those black holes. And each one of those galaxies or each one of those universes has also hundreds of billions of galaxies and each one of those has a black hole. You go through that hundreds of billions of galaxies that, the whole thing fractal. Exactly. Just like just keeps happening. There's a resistance. Nah, come on. Yeah. There's a thing that can instant reaction to resist that notion as if the universe itself isn't already the most incredible thing of magic.

Speaker 1:          01:19:08       Right? I know. What do you care if it's infinite? Why is that? Why would you even resist that? Because that's the part of the binary thinking. It's like you want something to have an end. It's like it's, it's a, it's a way for us to survive. But like, you know, it's like, oh, there's an end to that that creates a, uh, a need to survive. But when you think of things in an abstract like, like, well, if something is just infinite, infinite, infinite, and what does that mean about us? It's like, that's the question. That's the thing to explore because then you have to re negotiate your, your, your relationship to reality, which is pretty sick. We have at least we'd like to take comfort in the idea that the universe has at least there's a certain parameter to it. I know now it's 14 billion light years and that's it. No more, no more. Okay. If you can even understand what 14 billion light is, there's no way it could be that number. It seems more like 19 whatever that number is. They know what I'm saying. The Way Cox explained it to me, that you, and I believe Sean Carroll explain it this way as well. There's a real

Speaker 2:          01:20:08       does real lack of understanding about what goes beyond that because it takes a certain amount of time for light to even get to us in that time that, that the light doesn't move fast enough to reach us from further events. Yeah. So like if you had something from like 200 billion light years ago when maybe the light wouldn't even get to us yet. Yeah. There's things that, yeah, I mean we're living in a time pain. Yeah. I mean that's when you, that's the other mind fuck. When you're looking in the sky and you're seeing a galaxy or a any sort of star like in the deep, deep, deep distance of space. Yeah. The fucking light coming from that thing left a million years ago. Yeah, I know way more. You're literally just looking at the past. What is, if you got to imagine what is the closest star to our star in the the f the seeable universe.

Speaker 2:          01:21:04       When you look up into the, to the night sky, what are the things? Was the dog star? I know our way. Is that a star? Sometimes things are called stars, but their planets from old school times and I could be wrong if you had to guess was the closest. How many like office in right? I don't know. That's how it's great. I have this entire, is it? How much is it? How far was that? Four. 4.3 light years from Earth. Wow. That's bad. That's a hop. Skip and that jump kills. Here you go. The speed of light take you four years. Like the Hawaii of outer space that like they go there and they was a pit stop there before they come to earth and the aliens come. They want to chill. I hope so.

Speaker 1:          01:21:43       All right. So hold on. There's a this is it. Oh Shit. Breaking. No, not really. No. So it's a binary pair. So I imagine that means that they move around each other a little bit orbit around each other. There's technically a third star Proxima Centauri, which is because it says those are an average of 4.3. This one's 4.22 so it's nearly closer. Nice. It's that average. So two are closer than the one on one day? No. Do they know if there's planets around those stars? So the um, they didn't even know there were other planets for sure. Other than, I know, isn't that crazy? Until just a couple of decades ago. It's so amazing to me. It's like shining a flashlight in the ocean. Yeah. You know, like that's what spaces, like you're removing a beam, but like things are constantly changing at different distances and you can see better under certain circumstances and you can see at different times.

Speaker 1:          01:22:34       So like it's kind of like a big existential party. You're like, I think I'm making sense of this. And then there's all these theories and then someone catches another angle. They're like, no, no, no. I mean, yes, a little bit of what you guys were thinking but also this. And they're like fuck. And they just keep adding to it. But I don't know if we're going to find necessarily anything. Um, well when you talk to physicists about the subject and they try to explain to you how they even reached these conclusions and how they know that there's black holes out there in the first place and the theories fucking like these, these, these theories of multi verses and yeah, that's my favorite. And brains. The membranes that there's like, yeah, in theory, like lines of Universes, then we collide with each other occasionally. Yeah. What the fuck?

Speaker 1:          01:23:19       That's what I think ghosts are by the way. Which was like in the interest in, it was an interstellar one with, yeah, with Matthew Modine. Is that the star [inaudible] [inaudible] list guys, vision quest. Different era or the Russian training with the log. Yeah. The stairs. Yes. No, he wasn't rushing. He was a no, no, no, no. Here's the shoot. Oh yeah, he was, he was like the cold trick, right boy. Yeah. Some, but there was like a guy training that was gable brick and mortar was, was the opponent training. Well, Matthew Modine was trading crazy, but he was trying to drop weight to go down to fight this, the Russell, this guy that everybody was terrified of. Yeah, that's right. What it was, but was shoot the one that was walking with a log. Yeah. He was carrying a log up us up stadium stairs. Right. That was so sad.

Speaker 1:          01:24:06       And he was like super hardcore. He's like, you think you're going to make the weight? He goes, I hope so. He goes, I hope so too. And just kept walking with a long boom. Good. See if you can find that scene. That's so good. I mean, it's a great movie, man. It's a great thing. Cause like that interaction right there, it's so genius because it's like tells you everything you need to know about both of those characters. Yeah, exactly. So they go there. Here he is. There's a dude as bad as a beast wrestler. Of course. He's by himself as his friends. Got a fucking cool headband. Well, his friend was a fake Indian. Oh friend lied about being a native American so he could get into college. No cheaper started made him look cool. Like, Oh, here we go. Do I know what you thought on Sweet Thompson hug? Can you play this over the air? No, no, don't. We'll get, we'll get pulled. Yeah. Taken. Make. Wait. I hope so. I was like, oh, hope so too.

Speaker 1:          01:25:07       Just walking around with his log. Boom. Everyone's scared. Fuck that dude. It's pretty big. Yeah, dude for 80s yeah. Good. Well he looked like a wrestler. Yeah. He looked real like guys like Mark Schultz when he's competing in the Olympics. He was fucking jacked man. Yeah. There was some Jack wrestlers back then. Still this obviously. Yeah. It's one of the more physically intensive things you can do at that protection. That muscle protects you. It's also, I mean just wrestling all the time. You're gonna get strong. Oh yeah, that true. That too. You get a certain kind of strength to that weird grip strength Yo man and telling you that shit. It was like, it's like immediate, like violent amounts of strength like for grips and stuff like that. Cause I just remember my friend who was a wrestler and I was like, yeah, I don't know wrestling. It seems pretty hard or whatever. See here, let me show you a move. And I was standing, I was looking at him and I just blinked and I was just out of breath on the ground, on my back. Just like

Speaker 2:          01:26:05       the experts at throwing bodies around. Just like, ugh. Okay. I mean it's like strength grip and being able to torque shit and shit happened. I mean it's insane to think about things you do to get fit right. Like with sandbags and stuff. People do lie like extreme things, right? They flip tires, throw sand bangers. Yup. They take a heavy bags too. They throw them over their shoulder. Oh yeah. When you're wrestling, you doing all that plus and plus it's resisting plus another things trying to get you right. Yeah. It's super active. It's like it's like active strength. That's going to be a deeper form of strength. Range of motion. Strength. Yeah. That's why the worst kind of strength is like Nautilus machine strength. Yeah. Yeah. Weight assisted mission. Not the worst kind of strange, I shouldn't say that. Those things all have their purpose. They're really good for like specific types of works at workouts and specific types of exercises where you're just trying to fatigue the muscles like a lot, a lot of strength and conditioning athletes like to use those to bang out reps because it's, they feel like there's less factors going on in terms of, um, whether or not you could drop the weight when the, when you're losing your coordination.

Speaker 2:          01:27:09       Safe lost. It's safer, but it's, most people don't think it's ideal for just for sports specific maybe for, um, um, just overall strength because you're, you're not getting balanced with it. Like if you, if you go to heavy weights, like free weights, most people think that free weights are superior to a machine because you got to balance that thing, push it up. Then you develop, you develop stability, you're actually holding the weight instead of just pushing against a for like using your force against something that's lined up on tracks. Yeah, you're controlling it. You have to control it the whole way. Yeah. So that's what wrestling is, but it's fighting back. It's even harder to get a hundred on top of that 80 pound dude who's also fighting back and fuck. Like he was trying to pick them up and move them around and he was also trying to get you at the same time.

Speaker 2:          01:27:57       And it's true and it's all strategic. So you're like honest, strategic, instinctual level. Then your hope for your, your training and your reflexes and your intuition. It's really interesting to watch like really skillful technical wrestlers cause they'd go from one technique to another and they just chain wrestle like watching. Like a lot of those, particularly Russians, there's a lot of Russian, a lot of Soviet block athletes from, you know, years back even were like really, really technical. What they're wrestling really beautiful to watch them chain these techniques together and do these different moves to try to achieve dominance. Still crazy sport. Yeah. I, whenever I watched it it's like you feel like, it's like when I watch dance I'm like I'm kind of moving with it, you know? I mean that happens with all sports I suppose. But wrestling, it's just like, like, like the energy when I'm watching it, which has been very rare, but in high school used to see wrestling matches.

Speaker 2:          01:28:51       My friend was a wrestler and just be like, oh whoa. Oh Man. Oh fucking exciting. Yeah, it's cool cause it's like it slows down, it's fast, it's slow, it's fast, they're exhausted. You can take a break, they go in and then, then like nothing for awhile. Like really just like slow mayors and then suddenly someone just does like this really weird and it just flips and it's like, I love that energy man. It's a different thing than any other sport. Yeah. It's different than any other sport that's in the Olympics too. Like the Olympics, you have boxing and wrestling and then you have sports, judo, judo, even tuck window. They have talked when don't even pitch to now. But the thing is that those, those are the, it's a different kind of sport man. It's a sport where people get fucked up. Yeah. Those are different.

Speaker 2:          01:29:36       Yeah. They're just different. It's a different feeling when you watch in it, it's a different consequence when you fail. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. I mean it's as close as you can get. It's the closest thing to fighting. Oh yeah. Um, I mean cause fighting is mostly grappling. It's a lot of it. A lot. It's not everything. Yeah. But like at least what, two thirds maybe? Well No. Okay. Real fights. Really like a street fight or like make street fights go down pretty quick. Right. Sometimes they do, but sometimes they just get, people get knocked out. Sometimes people can just get flat cause they don't know how to strike and someone does and they punch them in the face. That happens a lot. There's a lot of videos. I think I've seen some of those. Yeah, I mean it definitely does happen that a lot of fights go to the ground and I think Jujitsu, a great thing to learn and wrestling's a great thing to learn because of that, like the ability to manipulate someone's body is really important, but you also should under understand what someone's doing.

Speaker 2:          01:30:34       If they're trying to punch you. Some people just don't have any idea what's happening. Then they just get bong, their fucking bell crack because they don't see a guy pulling his hand back. They don't see the shift in weight. They don't see someone about to punch them. They don't see where the punch is going to come from, what direction that they have to avoid. They don't see those things because they've never experienced it cause they, they don't have a training. They don't have any training in striking. That's justice. That's fucking dangerous man. This was because if you lose to a wrestler or you lose to a Jujitsu Guy, a lot of times you wrestling my beat you up on the ground. You might ground and pound you, but Jujitsu, you guys probably just going to choke you, but the kickbox is going to slam his fucking shit in your face.

Speaker 2:          01:31:13       You do not want them, man. You do not want that. Holy Shit. The worst way to lose, the worst way to lose is to a striker. Oh, past weekend. No, this is a fastest ever knock out in UFC history. This Guy Jorge Mazda doll knocked out this two time Olympic wrestler, Ben Asker, who's a beast of a wrestler and it knocked him out in five seconds because asked her and went to shoot to try to get ahold of his legs and Matsudo ran at him with a flying knee and hit him right in the face was while he's trying to bend forward. That's legal. Yo Up. Fuck yeah, it's illegal. That's her right there. Boom. Oh fuck. It's all over the Internet. You want to see it? So yeah, it takes five seconds. It was one of those things where we watched it and we went whole Lee shit like as it happened. Okay. Is that US talking about it? Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:32:00       that one down there. But that one dog. Oh man, you just turned away from it wasn't the one below it. That wasn't it. It wasn't it. No, it wasn't it. Oh, it's other people talking about the reaction. I see. It's definitely on Instagram, but apparently it's getting pulled left and right. Of course. Again tried to do that. She's like, that's for everybody. I don't understand why they would let everybody have that. It's like, no, we need that. We need to own that commodity. But that's, it's, it's good for everybody. It's not how the Internet works either. You don't win the fans here. Here we go. So this is the beginning of the fight. Ready? This is route one. Yup.

Speaker 1:          01:32:34       Al Cold. Five second call by the ref though. It wasn't even really five seconds. He was out cold at three seconds. Someone did a time from here. Boom. Out Cold. Three seconds as a reference. Running over to him. Yeah. And why is he yelling at him who hated each other really? Or they hate each other? Jorge Mosfet all said that guy was taunting him for like 10 years talking shit to him. So he couldn't wait to do that to him. Yeah. Now what? Well, Ben dust himself off. He took it like a man. I mean he really did. He went on a talk show and talked about it afterwards. Good. Yeah. That's, that's how you fucking do shit. Yeah. Yeah. He's like, look, it sucks. I don't like losing that guy. He's a Douche. Yeah. Right. But they're probably going to end up being somewhat friend friendly later down the line. No, you don't think so? No. Mazda Dahl said that if you saw them at a whole foods, it's not over. He's still smacking him in the face. Even whole foods couldn't hold him. Bet whole foods can't hold him back. Right in front of the Kombucha. The real gts can Bucci the kind that you need a credit you going to show your id to get.

Speaker 1:          01:33:39       It's like no whole foods, man. That's like, that's like, Hello Gran. You can't start a fight there. It's like, no, he's willing to break the rules. I saw a fight at Disneyland on Instagram the other day. Dude are going out on Disneyland. Someone got punched a chick to seek fulfillment to. People were filming it and these people were throwing down in front of their kids at Disneyland. Terrible technique to everybody's terrible. Terrible. I love that. The equally disappointing aspects of it. Oh, it's terrible. It's the most disappointing. It's like guys, if you're gonna find it's just learn some technique. Yeah. I mean it's like someone's stealing the stage and playing a bad guitar. You'd be angry with, of course. See what I'm saying? Yeah. I get it. No, I'm in complete agreement. I think that that is kind of equally important because, hey man, if people are filming, yeah, people would like a consensual fight.

Speaker 1:          01:34:31       You look like you're trying to pretend you know how to fight. Yeah. And the worst is the pulling off of the shirt. I don't even know how that even becomes like an instinct. It's actually a good move. Well, it's to keep you slippery, right? So you can like, well you want, yeah. You don't want anybody choking you to death with your own jacket. Oh, that's true. Yeah, that's true. Well, okay. But I mean, I guess in the videos that I've seen, it's been mostly about like, hey check, she's Jack that I am and like, oh bro. Yeah. At the end here

Speaker 2:          01:34:58       I kind of look like this dude got choked out, but I couldn't quite tell what was going on here because he went down quick cause that's security and he might even been off for a second. So he's pulling that girl's hair. See? Oh yeah, he's out cold. Yeah, he's out cold. Oh Gee. Dropped him. His head banged off the ground too. That ball dude choke the shit out. And he's like, well I just killed that guy. But to get outta here I think. But yeah, no one will ever choke. No charges were pressed because no one wanted to say what the fight was about. Hilarious. Yeah. But was that so it was a guy that was holding a girl's hair at the use get you guys said he got spit on and then he went crazy. Oh Wow. Yeah. I don't know if that was their whole thing.

Speaker 2:          01:35:33       Not Funny. That's all. It takes a little bit of water. A little bit of, yeah. It's funny. Yes. I got all the things that make people go crazy spit in someone's face. It's like, wow, we're ready to go to war here. Yeah. I mean it's, it is pretty quick not approved biological weapon back in the day. If you had some like smallpox shit. Yeah. Like how dare you potentially infect me. Do you ever hear Damon Wayne's joke about, uh, when a magic Johnson came back to the NBA, Magic Johnson, after you had HIV and then came back to the NBA, he said, Damon Wayans, who's my opinion, one of the most underrated comedians of all time, still one of my fantastic all time favorites, but in one of his HBO specials, he goes, he goes, everybody was avoided. Magic. Nobody wanted to play defense. He goes a step. Dennis Rodman, he goes down as rob was like, listen, I spit in your mouth and accelerate your symptoms.

Speaker 4:          01:36:27       I'll spit in your

Speaker 2:          01:36:28       mouth and accelerate your sim to this day. That's one of my all time favorite lines. I hear that line on my God. Damn, that's a great, that is a crafted, brilliant thing to think. It's like, it's like 180 it hurts. That one hurts. I'll spit in your mouth and accelerate your symptoms I made today. No, he says, I'm sorry, I fucked Madonna and that's what he said. I'll spit in your mouth and accelerate. You said, oh, it's even, it's even more potent.

Speaker 4:          01:36:54       Oh, that's

Speaker 2:          01:36:54       like some shit talking. Just like that's the type of shit that man is, that wins the whole thing. Yeah. You got to walk away. Yeah. Keep talking after that. Now that's it. And I think you lost like, man, take it last second man. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Maybe that's why it's bidding and it's also, it's gross. It's just gross. It's just gross and so rude. It's so fucking rude. I mean, when someone purposefully spits at you. Yeah. You're like, I want to destroy you. Okay. I would kind of understand that reaction. You said thing people were getting like licking food at grocery stores. Like some girls going to get arrested or she's facing like 20 years or something. I don't understand. I don't want to know why they thought that it was funny to look food and then know that people are going to buy it. Yeah. Yeah. Well people think it's funny to spit in people's food when they're, they're serving it to, yeah, it's weird. People would kind of grow sometimes, you know? They'll get it any way they can, man. Yeah, we'll get back. We'll get back at the, where else do you take this shit position in life? It's like, no, I don't, I don't agree. He's your

Speaker 3:          01:37:56       salad. Sorry. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:37:58       No, I mix it up. Eh? So you gotta be nice to son. You gotta mean that to everybody, but we like swapping spit with people and that weird. That is really weird. Well, because that's consensual, right? Yeah. Well not just, it's consensual. It's like it's pleasurable. It's like even if it's consensual, you don't want to be spitting in your mouth. No, because that's super fucking gross. Yeah. Kissing someone's okay amount and they're like, took like that would be weird. Like you just spit in my food. This is gross. But if someone's kissing you and their tongues in your mouth and you're swapping, literally swapping spit, it's sexy. It's hot. We like it. Yeah. Yeah. I'm glad. I'm glad that I liked that part. Yeah, because the other part I'm just like, Yo Bro, you can't, what's wrong with you? Why are you doing? Are you doing spitting in each other's mouth?

Speaker 2:          01:38:41       You don't need to do that. You can just choose not to. It's like the delivery methods where we have a real problem with, yeah, exactly. Apart from the program is two fucking football players do it. This specific giant loop that's a moving, so they really did do it for the scene. Pretty short. They had to, oh, fucking viscous. They spit at each other's mouths. Why? Guess when you're playing football, you just want to be as savage as possible and you don't give a fuck. You'll make out with a dude, you'll fuck a couple of guys and then you'll go play football. Cause then you feel like you don't care the entire force of the universe behind you out. People do things to let people know they don't give a fuck. Yeah, that's true. That is true. I do things like that. Like have you seen euphoria

Speaker 3:          01:39:25       with HBO show? No. It's fucking fantastic. Yeah, it's, I think it's out now. You know what it is, Jamie? I've heard of it and heard it's good and have not watched it yet. It's ridiculous. It's a basically about a, it centers around a drug addicted, uh, high schooler, uh, played by as in [inaudible] and uh, it's just about the modern kind of modern generation, high school experience through her, uh, drug addiction or trying to overcome drug addiction or kind of realizing what is going on with her at that stage in her life. And there's just, it's just the culture of all the things that kids deal with these days, but it's done in a really, really hyper beautiful stylized way. It's so crazy intelligent. It's amazing. It really blew me away. I was not like, I just went to the opening and it was like, ah, I don't know. I don't know what this is. And then, uh, the guy got up and talked about it because the writer, uh, experienced addiction has been clean for 15 years. Something that, but that was his life back then as a, as a teenager. And so they had adapted it and it's great. But the reason why I bring that up is, what were we talking about a second ago? What are talking about spitting each other's mouths?

Speaker 2:          01:40:38       Yeah. We went from that to people want to pretend they don't give a fuck. I'd want to let you know they don't give a fuck. Oh yeah, that's exactly right. Yeah. So there's like a great scene.

Speaker 3:          01:40:47       The first in the pilot doesn't really give away anything, but one of the characters, she's in a kitchen

Speaker 1:          01:40:54       and there's like a big bully dude, popular guy that's like getting, getting interface and being really threatening. And then she takes a knife and she just slices her arm and shit. That fixtures, she, she's like, stay away from me mother fucker or something like that. Uh, there's something more eloquent that happens and then she introduces herself and leaves. She goes, oh, by the way, and she walks out. But it's such an intense scene. It goes from the darkest of the darkest to like a practical, this, this person is really smart. The girl who cut her arm is incredibly smart. That's a crazy thing to do to someone. Yes. Yourself, that kind of stuff in front of them. It just shows you that it's like, I've, I don't give a fuck. Like that's like, yeah, exactly. Yeah. And the guy was, everyone was just frozen. They were like, I don't know what, they're just a bunch of high school kids in the kitchen.

Speaker 1:          01:41:48       Pretty cool. Pretty cool. Like a character detail that just kinda like shows you everything about that character in a split second. Yeah. Jesus. I'm amazing. I love that shit. That's intense. Yeah. I mean I love when you don't know something's good, you don't know anything about it. And then it turns out to be awesome. It's the best feeling Christmas or my, one of my favorite parts of going to the movies I love previous but yet they ruined moving. Exactly. I know I'm the same way. I'm the same way. It's like peeking into a Christmas present. Like when you're a little kid like can I just unwrap this pitch? He rabbit out to fucking tie fighter. Oh my God. It's Darth Vader's. Yeah, it will little fucking sneak and then [inaudible] act like, oh my God. And your parents like let me look at that rapping again. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:42:37       Fuck I haven't been caught but that's almost like what previews are. You had to see a little bit about what the movie is about. Wouldn't it be better if he had no fucking idea of you just, I don't want to even know a synopsis. I don't want to, I don't know what King Kong is, which if you didn't know what King Kong was, I'm like the newer King Kong, you thought it was like about like a king in the land. You have no idea and you sit down. You have no idea how the store is going to come. Come out and the moment you see the gorilla, you probably like, Holy Shit. Yeah. When he's fighting dinosaurs and stuff, you'd be like, Holy Shit. Yeah. It would be so much better than you watch. All those previous are just partial fucks are amazing, you know? But you go to see it and it's like, yeah, I've already seen it.

Speaker 1:          01:43:22       I know he's going to breathe fire out of his mouth. I know what it looks like. You've shown me. Yeah, it's I, my favorite trailers are the ones that just kind of give you a feeling of the world and that's it. Like the new joker trailer is sick. Yes. It's perfect example. It's great. It's a piece of art unto itself, but it's not giving away a lot. I mean, there's a lot of time you see a lot of shit and you kind of get an idea, but not really. It's a, it's a very artful trailer. Yeah. But you gotta have something. Yeah. As people aren't going to go to you. I know that's the problem. But remember Cloverfield. Yeah. When that came out and make that weird and the ads that they would show would just be like, whoa. And that's all you heard Cloverfield.

Speaker 1:          01:44:02       And you're like, what the fuck is this? Those are weird movies, right? Like those movies, like this movie sucks because it was just filmed by people who were there well yet. Right. Quality's terrible. The camera's going to be shaky. Yeah. You're going to scream and drop the camera. It's going to bounce it. You're going to see, like kind of knew back then. If, I mean Blair, which, you know, it was kind of the starter of that Bro Blair, which freaked me out the first time I went to see it. I want to see it with Chris McGuire, a comedian, Chris McGuire, and um, a couple folks that worked at the movie theater across the street and they came to see us. We were performing at the Houston laugh stop. Okay. And so they, they, we were talking to them before the show and they're like, hey, we work at the movie theater.

Speaker 1:          01:44:44       I was like, oh, we're going to probably go there this weekend and see that Blair witch movie. And the dude was like, Hey, I have the keys. If you want, we can open it up tonight after the show. I was like, what? I was like, fuck yeah. So it was right across the street. So me and McGuire, and I think there's like three of them that worked there. We all hung out and watched the Blair witch together in a fucking empty movie theater. They made popcorn and everything. What does dope, the key to the place, I mean, if their boss found out they would be flexible. Yeah. So don't share this, y'all not telling anybody, but this is like 1718 years ago at the very, I mean, when that movie come out, as long as I'm movies, a long ass time ago, 1989 99 so yeah, 20 fucking years ago and we were at the Houston laugh stop.

Speaker 1:          01:45:30       That was awesome. So cool. What a great flow of an event to go pass gag. And then you're like, oh fuck, check this out. Yeah, it was fun. But that movie was [inaudible] effect scare the shit out of you. Yeah. It took me a while to get into it cause I remember dogma. Do you remember that? That crew has so that I remember the celebration that had come out, that was the first movie that I saw that was made all on India because they had those rules. Like they, we only use natural light. We only use DV Cams, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Um, and it was great. It was interesting and Weird and Oh my God, that's kind of crazy. And then Blair witch came out and had that kind of vibe but a little bit more curated, like a narrative. But I was like, I thought it was eerie, but I really didn't get scared until the very, very end when when it's going down the stairs and then the flashlight is searching around and then sees that girl facing the corner.

Speaker 1:          01:46:24       That fucked me up. Yes. That, that, that one moment. So the whole thing, I was like, oh, it's pretty, you know, it's cool. It's creepy. Okay, well then it just, that thing, I was like, fuck you. It was a strong closer. There was this real strong closer. I mean that's the way you go out. Yeah. That's the way you go out. But it's an interesting that we like movies that are on film, right? We'd like that look. Yeah we do. We like the things that are in the forefront and focus, but everything in the back is just like, yeah cause we're in fuzzy. That's true. It's got this like quality thing to it. Even though now we see videos that are very literal from phones all the time. We see that kind of imagery. We still don't necessarily see, you wouldn't see that in a movie theater necessarily.

Speaker 1:          01:47:08       You too. Too distracted by all the outside images. So like if you're talking to people like you and I are talking, I'm focusing on you. I know there's some stuff over the laugh and some stuff over the right, but I'm not seeing it the same way I'm seeing you. Yes. Right. That's one of the reasons why like when you interpret video, like you visually interpret video, it's a very weird distortion. Even though it's the most accurate representation because you can't look at everything at the same time. So if you look at a photograph and everything is in focus, what kind of, what are you using? What are you using to see things with? Because this is my eyes don't work like that. Yeah. My eyes are looking at you and everything around you. Like I know there's a clock right here, but I'm, dude, I can't even read what time it is.

Speaker 1:          01:47:46       It's right there. I can't remember it. But now I can read it, right? Yes. Okay. You know this stuff that's just a few inches to your left or right and I literally can't see them. Yes. Just a tiny, tiny point that you're actually focusing on. Yeah, just focus on right in front of these things right in front of the face. So that's, make that make sense. Like for focus, it kind of replicates the way, and it's also a storytelling mechanism, right? Focus on this part. Yes, it definitely is that. Yeah. But it also, it's like the, it looks cooler. It just looks, yeah, it looks dope. It looks pro, you know? It's, it's High Rez. Yeah. Many like a video camera, like a regular standard consumer grade video camera almost takes clearer pictures. Oh, for sure. Yeah. It's like if you ever put your phone in timelapse mode.

Speaker 1:          01:48:30       Yes. It looks like the way it tracks when you're moving it over objects, it's got a higher frame rate or something like that. Um, but it makes it look like that pan and scan shit. You know, when you're watching sports events or whatever and it just looks wrong. You know what I mean? Like it's too literal. There's something to the way everything moves just feels slightly off. Do you think that we're just accustomed to the way film looks and then if we were accustomed to the way video looks than film would be look clunky to us. You have everything started off as video and then they said, you know what, it's not really good to have everything in focus. It's only good to have some things in focus in the bag away. Some things are blurry and then they come into focus and actually enhances the filmmaking.

Speaker 1:          01:49:13       Yes. Right? Yes. Like in a horror movie when something's blurry and then they zoom in on it and you see it, it's like a fucking monster Highlander under the bed. You're like, oh no. Like that's not what, I didn't want that to happen. You've now just revealed yeah, exactly what I didn't want to see. Yeah, yeah. No, I agree. Yeah. I don't know. I mean, I don't know, but I know that, you know, people have like film, I think it just looks, it's the texture of it, but now people like DV. Well, it's like people like vinyl, right? There's people that are just die hard vinyl fans. They like to sound. Yeah, I mean, you know, I like, I like, I like anything, you know, but I like to, I'd like to make sure

Speaker 3:          01:49:48       that it's the best quality of it or the most natural use case for it. You know? You know, it's like when people used to mix, when people started listening more to music in their car, that they could like put a thing that they bought in their car with an eight track or whatever. Or they used to have record players for cars too. But you know, uh, the way that music sounded, they were kind of, they also had to consider the mix of car speakers. What does it sound like on car speakers? So going back to the aura tones and the ns tens and then the standardized car speakers that people test audio in and it's a different parameter, right? Cause you're, you're stuck in this little contained metal box. Yeah. Yeah. So you gotta figure out how to mix the music, but generally it's the sound system that has to be adjusted.

Speaker 3:          01:50:35       The sound systems have to, but you mix Tuesday, they, they kind of meet each other in the middle, but great, high five systems. My actually, it's a quick anecdote, but uh, when I was in Seattle I knew that I liked high five systems, but I didn't know why they were so expensive. And so I went into this place, this guy named Leland. Oh, who was working there. I was kind of friends with them cause I'd come in and I just scoped gear all the time. Just look at like, oh, I love audio gear. It's just really sweet. And um, and then one day it was towards the end when they were closing and, uh, he turns to me and says, hey man, do you want to get your brain fried? And I was like, what do you mean? And he's like, stick around. I'm like, okay.

Speaker 3:          01:51:14       And he closed shop. A couple of his friends came and closed the shop. It's like maybe five of us went into the back room, smoked some marijuana, went into the showroom, the main room where they have all the speakers and all the different types of units. And he says, then he just kind of turns to us. We all sit down on the couch and he says, okay, you're going to listen to a, this is a system in total it costs about $150,000. Wow. And, uh, and then he just goes proceeds and goes through and explains all of the stages that, you know, that the current is going through and what the music is going through, what's being played on all the cables that are being used, all this stuff. And then I heard all of that crazy speakers like, okay, cool. He lowers the lights and he puts on a Bill Evans trio record.

Speaker 3:          01:51:58       I can't remember which one. Um, and he just presses play and we sit down and like within probably 30 seconds, people were crying. Wow. And cause it felt holographic. It felt like you were in the room with those musicians that were playing right there for you. And then I had the realization, it's not the money, it's not about the money, it's about what does it take to engineer a machine that becomes invisible to the experience. And that was, that kind of blew my mind. So whenever you're designing anything, it's like you're designing the experience. The engineering should, should get the fuck out of the way. What was the medium? Was it vinyl? Vinyl? Yeah. Yeah. What you think, like in your description, what is different about vinyl? Well, I mean, supposedly if you have a really nice quality piece of violence cut really well, um, you get as close to the original mastered recording experience like coming out of the studio if you're talking about older tape.

Speaker 3:          01:53:07       So whatever that final mix is, when someone plays it and they're like, it's been mastered, here's the Stereo to track, we're playing stereo to track. It's been mastered. Excuse me, I'm a little wheezy. Um, and uh, and that's what you hear. You hear it in the best possible context on the speakers that it was mixed on. It's everything's optimal. So essentially when a record is pressed, um, if it can mimic that, the stereo to track the master, uh, which it does, uh, then you have something that for at least the first, I don't know, vinyl people will say how many times, but a record starts to wear down. But if you have a fresh press, you can run it a bunch of times before it starts to degrade. But in that state, you're hearing it like analog, super analog. It's like as analog as you can.

Speaker 3:          01:53:52       How many times do you think you play it before it starts to grid? I don't know. I guess it depends on the ears of the audio file, but there's probably an average, I don't know what it would be. Maybe 60, 30, 40, 50 times. Now is there a digital format that at least comes close? Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Flack files. It's a file format. Um, black files are good. Um, usually 128 96 killer hurts. Like that's, there's like kind of a mastering digital mastering standard and that standard, uh, is is basically what that is, what a record is. So that's why you have like sites like HD tracks that I really dig. You can get all your favorite out. Well not all, it's not as big of a selection, but you can get a full resolution from like stereo two track master from the studio level quality in a digital format that you can buy and then put into a high rez player.

Speaker 3:          01:54:50       So I have a high Rez player, a high five pro player, and it runs the, has really nice circuitry and all that stuff and then use a really great pair of headphones. And you've got the closest thing to a record that's repeatable, infinite times. And is the headphones the way to go or one of those crazy tower speaker jammies, the way to go? Oh well it depends on your, your use case. Like if you, if you know, if you ear and a house and you want like a cool living room system or whatever, I would always opt for speakers and not, not Sonos and not that kind of stuff. People, they dig it. But um, true. I mean records are meant to be played off of two speakers with this. It's a 2.1 system, unless it's specifically engineered, which is very rare for like atmos or whatever the fuck. But usually it's two speakers in a subwoofer. So why would I not want to hear the music the way it's supposed to sound? Right. However, I understand the convenience of those speakers, so I'm not totally knocking it. But for me, if you're going to get a for your living room,

Speaker 1:          01:55:44       if I can get a 2.1 system, yeah, you want it played out the way you want, the sound to come at you, the way it was recorded. Otherwise it changes the experience completely. The Sonos and those types of things, they, they fake stereo. Henry Rollins was on the podcast and he has this most preposterous set up in his house. He is a gigantic audio file. Oh Shit. A massive lover of music. Oh my God. He collects all these albums and he even runs a radio show. He does. I love his radio show. It's dope. It's on case here. So these are the, like these are the crazy fucking speakers he has in his house. What the fuck? And there's some, what are those $200,000 is what they are. Oh, I forget. I have seen those. I've seen pictures of that. That's um, who makes this Alexandria XLF is what they're called.

Speaker 1:          01:56:30       Okay. Wilson. Alexandria. Dope. They look, I mean, it's disgusting looking at those things, but you have to have their weapons. You know, like you, you, you have to have pull back so we can see a gas for full size. Those things like look at what a weird looking piece of equipment looks like. Future robot. It looks like an ATM machine, right? Yeah, totally. Or like a display screen robot. Yeah. Today we have here swipe here for your thank you for your business. Goodbye. So is the one that we're looking at on the right hand side? Is that the back? Yeah. Wow. Look at all that shows the inputs to know what the fuck they have discreet inputs for each of the um, the frequency spectrums, the different speakers. Oh Damn. Some people go deep. It's like everything, right. Look at it. That's what it looks like.

Speaker 1:          01:57:16       That's another one. Look at that Guy Razor's thing. I mean it's, it's beautiful. I mean audio is hundred thousand dollars. Fucking speakers. Look at that guy. He's like, I have it off my spirit. Look at the fringe on my captains. I am Heinrich odor wardens. That's crazy, man. Yeah. Well there you go. And around system and the cars. Amazing to man because right. You know, like you get like I'm a mark 11 sin, like I've a alone as a mark Levinson system in it. It's just like the whole thing's engineered for the shape of the inside of the car. Yes. Such as rings out and all these perfect places. It's tight. One of my favorite places, listen to music is a car and I was stoked to get my Audi cause I got the BNO system in there and I've never heard better audio. I mean I've heard some dope ass.

Speaker 1:          01:58:04       I think I have a, I think the Tesla uses Levinson stuff. I'm not totally sure people haven't been able to figure it out, but they should've by now. But I remember like five years ago trying to figure like what is the premium audio system like what is besides a premium audience. And I couldn't get an answer if someone figured out what the amp was, but they couldn't figure out the speakers or something. That's interesting. But um, but the, how eight man banging all of a sudden, and I have some eighteens at home. There is a 2.1 system and it just finally started, it kicked in and now it sounds amazing. I was like really kind of disappointed for a while. Yeah, it's weird. There's almost, yeah, there's like a burn in what? I think there's a burden.

Speaker 3:          01:58:42       I'm not sure. Maybe it's totally, maybe you got a bad ball. Maybe I did get better weight. I mean, what'd you think of this? We'd buy them. Fantastic. It's pretty real groovy. Really good. Yeah. It's just, it's not weighing you down. No, it's just a nice, friendly like you're, you're fucking high. But like I, yeah, I feel good. It's stuff. It's not like they not freaking out. I like it a lot. What's it called again? Purple. What? A purple tongue? No, a purple rain. Thank you. Geez. Why does he know James Bond? I know the great brain. That's awesome. Purple Venom. Legit him. Wow. All these speakers you have the browns. Yeah. And then there's like a subwoofer that looks like an egg. Yeah. And they're great cause it's, I have my house kind of mid century mod and mid century modern. Oh, that's me. Trends. I think it's hilarious.

Speaker 3:          01:59:41       The first time. I think I've said it out loud. Yes. Sorry. That's wrong. Just like mid century mod. That's funny. Oh, you're going to love this. The curtains are provided for, I'm, you'll notice that the, the, the, the overall layout is mid cinch mod. Um, the only people I don't trust is when I go over their house and they have a minimalist set up, like where they have like plastic chairs that don't have any cushion and a flat table with nothing on it. And everything's small and there's nothing there. I'm like, what are you doing? Yeah, I know. You show me your clean brain. Yeah. Fucking psychopath tone. What's happening here? Where's the, where's the soft surfaces? Where's the place to chill? I, you know, I, I like what I dig is that mid century modern furniture, you know, I don't even know what that is. You know, like I'm a, was it jewel venn jewel?

Speaker 3:          02:00:26       Non Jewels? Uh, I forgot what his, it's a, I think he's a Swedish or Danish architect or furniture designer. Fin Jewel. That's it. I think. Um, and he makes these, like you've seen these chairs before, but the originals are just, it's such a great work of art. It's like sturdy, comfy, but light enough that there's like a bar in the back that's just made to grab and you can just throw it around. But when it is set up in a room, it looks substantial and it looks comfortable but super lightweight. So their idea was like to be super modular, really easy to move for company. You know, this are right here. Uh, that's not quite it typed in furniture. Oh yeah, yeah. I, I was his name a Finn Jewel, spelled f I and then, yeah, jewel maybe j. G. U. H L. Yeah. Like that orange one right there. Yeah. That's like one, one, one design. But that one it has that, that extra thing of, that's not how mine are minor. Just like it's just a, a back and uh, no arms and the, but the same shape and you sit in them and they're just great. They're like firm but comfortable. Like you feel active. Like you could get out of it if you needed to. That were there? Uh,

Speaker 1:          02:01:40       no. Uh, what does it say at the top? That's his shit. Fin Fin try u h l maybe try classic or something like that. But look and stuff though. Yeah. It's, I wonder if though the clicker, the grasshopper chair. Yeah. It's so weird when you have a chair that's that low to the ground that's too low. Mine are not like that are like thing is you can keep your feet in front of you. Yeah. Like the stretch your legs out like that one oh nine chair like that, that kind of stuff. So it's like normal chair height, but it's beautifully designed, but it's minimal. And for my living room, like I like the idea that I could just like move my furniture and if people want to dance or whatever, we can just do that. And you don't have to be the fuck, you know, I'm gonna need help.

Speaker 1:          02:02:22       Like one person could literally grab both chairs and move. Right. And you don't have some bullshit sitting there that could break. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Totally. Hey guys, don't come near the end table guys. I'm really sorry about that. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. I hate rock and roll music. It's Kinda everybody crazy and shit. He says, Eric, I told you the beat, the chill out mixes only. Yeah, you need to chill out. Mix for late night. We're like really groovy Joe beam stuff. You know, like in Brazilian Boston, Nova. Do you, what do you, what are your thoughts on like streaming services, like music, like title and stuff like that? You will, things like Spotify and Pandora, these street apple music, these streaming services. I think they're convenient, but uh, I don't quite trust the quality yet and I have a lot invested in iTunes.

Speaker 1:          02:03:12       Um, but I started using title only because it's the less, that seems to be the least popular of all the streaming services, but as Jay z's company, and not that I'm like a Jay z fan, I just liked that it's owned by an artist. Right. And that, um, they focus on super high end codex for their streaming. So it's like the highest quality possible for streaming since then. Spotify claims to have it. I don't think apple does it yet anyways, but I like, I like the title. So I mean, I guess the idea of being, as long as it's fair for the, the, the artist, you know, the deal for streaming and how streaming's streaming is calculated and how that turns into revenue for our, on the revenue side of things. Uh, that's really important. Biggest concerns, revenue side of things. Cause it seems like that's where this whole thing was like the wild, wild west when it got started in the, the way the parameters were established.

Speaker 1:          02:04:06       It's not in favor of the artist. It's in favor of the people that run the streaming companies. They're the ones who make the substantial profits. Yes, absolutely. Yeah. The companies do because all they have is the work of artists. I know. Just why it's so crazy. They make most of the money because they provided a platform. Yes. They have. You don't sell shit without artists. If every artist is like, Nah, fuck you and you don't have anything. Yeah. You have nothing. You don't sell anything. Yep. Like year to selling tomatoes and you don't even grow them. Yeah. You want most of the money, like if you were a tomato and you've got your tomato

Speaker 2:          02:04:38       from a farmer and the farmer to do all this fucking work to make the tomatoes and they sold them at your store, but you got almost all the money. Yeah. Those are amazing. I know. It's totally crazy. It doesn't make any sense. Well you couldn't grow tomatoes with any other farmer for the next 10 years afterwards cause they tie you up. Yeah. And you have to make commercials about these tomatoes, but you have to pay for them now. They know it all comes out of your profit, not ours. Yeah. Fuck that. It's all about, it's all about direct economy. You know what I mean? Like that's, that's the way, that's where we are now, I think. Right? Yeah. I think that's where we're, where we are, where we're headed. I think that's definitely, I don't, you know, I, I can barely, that's why I want to kind of do my own streaming stuff like that.

Speaker 2:          02:05:17       I don't want to be in tied up and to uh, with another company that utilize his behavioral statistical data to increase their algorithms for targeted advertising. Like that's not really interesting to me. Yeah. I think would've gone like youtube, just build it and they will come, you know, and then advertisers who resonate with your sort of mindset, they'll find you. There's so many, there's plenty of cool CBD brands and fill in the blank of cool companies that'd be more than happy to advertise on something that, you know, you'd have a guaranteed audience of a certain kind of people. Yes, totally. Totally. I think it's great. And I think also just having a direct store too, I just, I love the idea of like whatever I make that's just sold to the store and like you're just paying me and I'm getting it and you're getting the thing and that's it.

Speaker 2:          02:06:06       Yeah. I mean you've worked for a bunch of different companies before [inaudible] had done things. It's like it can be great. You can work with a bunch of beautiful people or be a disaster. You've got some time suck in the middle of the fucking mix and they, they just demand too much attention. There's too much conflict and nonsense and interpersonal drama. And sometimes people start fucking, oh yeah. People that work together and start fucking, and then you have to hear the opinions of bolted them while you pretend that you don't know that they're fucking, that this is weighing heavily on the way they're communicating with everybody else. Like, Oh yeah, that's uh, supporting each other and you're supposed to support them to now their relationship has become center stage in your office. That's like one of the reasons why people don't want office romances. Not even just because women don't want to be harassed by men that are trying to fuck them all the time.

Speaker 2:          02:06:55       So would just say no one can do it. But also because once it, a relationship does happen, one of two things. Either it'll grow, one's raped, yeah. Either it would go great and everyone's going to be a part of it. So your relationship becomes a part of the whole ecosystem of the office or it'll go terrible and people have to pick sides and or one of you has to leave like so or bad Juju. You, if you're amongst the most miraculous people, you have a amicable split and you become really good friends afterwards. You still work together with no problems. Even like each other spouses. Yeah. Right. It is possible. It is possible. It's happened. I'm sure it's happened. Yes, but much, much more rare. If I was

Speaker 1:          02:07:36       running a company, I'd be like, listen, you guys can't bang each other. Yes, I know it sounds gross. I know that you're here all day, but problem is like, what if you met the girl of your dreams on a job that was your dream job? You're like, Shit. What do you do? You have to make the decision. It's like a fucking Jennifer Lopez movie, right? Yeah, totally. Like, like two. It's called two successful. I don't give a fuck about this job, Jennifer. I want to be with you. Dot, dot, dot, and play the music. It's like, no, you don't have to quit. I'll quit. Fuck this, but I've got to quit. No, you can't. And then they decided to start their own firm. Yeah. If it was real chick movie, the girl would have like the smaller paycheck too and the guy would lose the bigger paycheck and he would, he would come, she would come home from work and he would be wearing a fucking like, like an apron and he'd be mopping.

Speaker 1:          02:08:23       Yes. That'd be great. Well, I guess I guess I should get used to it like that's how it is. My lifestyle. Michael Fell in love the perfect job. I gave up my perfect job for the perfect woman. Yeah, yeah. That would suck if you had the dream job, but you met a girl there who, she was single and she was in the you and you both knew each other and you're like, God dammit. What do you do? You start banging and don't tell anybody that's what you do. Right. Pro Probably. Or if you're like super pro and super committed, you just figured out a way not to and just kind of maybe come up with an agreement or something. I don't know. Plot your exit. Yes. You got to plot your eggs. Always know your exits while you're lying about banging each other. Yes. Yeah. You've got a lie.

Speaker 1:          02:09:06       You got to lie and say, yeah, we're going to, I'm going to the movies snipe, my friend Melissa. Anyway, going back to Todd's house for some Dick, that sucks. That's such a terrible way to live, guys. Don't do it. It's not worth it. Well, the most terrible is probably live in the closet. That's probably the most terrible. That's the most, it's a super unnecessary one I think. Yeah. In some cases. Not at all. Yeah. Well it's also like, it's symbolic of, you know, we all have things in like in a closet. I mean that's like a, that's like a pretty big level that's noticeable by many, many people. But in a way it is a metaphor for like, there are a lot of things that we don't allow ourselves to. Sure. You know, like let people know about, and especially in the corporate world, right?

Speaker 1:          02:09:49       You're, you're forced to present a air quotes, professional image, and this enhances your ability to earn living and enhances your ability to be successful inside that corporate structure. So you literally have to play a role all the time, which is why have you talked to women who are dominatrix is one of the things that they say is the, the guys who really like to get kicked in the balls and shit on are the guys who run businesses, the guys who are like, yeah, they need to feel it. It's fun. It feel alive. They need a kick in the balls. They need someone pissing in their mouth. They need so they need to get smacked. They want to get crazy because they're so buttoned down all day long. They can barely take it. God, they're so lucky. Reggie, you're so lucky in the artist. So lucky son of a bitch.

Speaker 1:          02:10:32       I love it. Sounds in a cubicle right now. Mad at you. No, man, you guys can live your dreams. I mean, I don't know. I mean it's, it's and people about credit card loans. Yeah, I know. Well, you know, we could be more of us, could be more creative, but we're not really designing or as a society to support that. Yeah. We, you and I can't fix the streets fixing the streets, but we can inspire people to fix the streets. Yeah, of course. I mean, you know, sometimes it just takes a little kick in the, in the yard bowls. Like I was having a conversation with my friend the other day. We were saying, he was saying that, you know, you kinda really need all kinds of people cause there's all kinds of jobs that you don't want to do. And I was like, yeah, we're having a problem with our exterminator and I'm going to like, but like could you imagine a dude who's really cool, who's in the killing rats?

Speaker 1:          02:11:20       Like that's what he does for a living. It's just flux rats up. That's his whole deal. He cares. Rats. I know, I know. There are people that just sort stern certain types of screws on an assembly line all day long. That's what they do. Somebody needs to do that, otherwise it's not going to get done right. You know, I mean theoretically, you know, robotics stuff, when people fear like robotics taking over jobs and things like things like that, theoretically the positive side of that is if societies organize themselves in a way that ensures that people remain productive, um, aside from these automations because it's taking away the menial tasks, the repetitive tasks, and then we were able to allocate more brainpower to the economy if that's the way it's viewed, it's Rad. I think it's a welcome thing. And I think, um, yeah, there's fear, you know, the unknown and things like that.

Speaker 1:          02:12:05       But if the government helps or, you know, there's a transition that's at least considered, uh, it could be really, really beneficial. Well, how do you feel about things like universal basic income? How do you feel about that? I mean, that's a cause. That's what people are gonna need. If we get to a point where millions of jobs vanish overnight because of automation, which could happen. You're looking at a, uh, I mean obviously I don't, I don't know what I'm talking about, but if I did, I would say you'd look at a nationwide version of what happened in Detroit when the auto industry backed out. Well, yeah, I mean, I don't know. I mean, I don't know like the universal, I mean it kind of makes sense, but I also don't know about the successful models and the non successful implementations because obviously with societies it becomes a lot more complicated because it's people and people are complicated.

Speaker 1:          02:12:56       And so when you say there's universal income for, there's a base amount that everybody will have. You don't have to worry about certain things. Right. Well transitioning out of the current state, the mind state that we're in, some people are just going to try to blow it, you know, all and then they'll go into debt and then you know maybe or maybe design the system to be really foolproof and it's just commodities based so people can only get the value that they're guaranteed as a, you know, rent being paid, actual food, you know, actual thing. So they don't have access to the money. I don't know that if you don't give them access to the money, then don't give them adequate choices in terms of where they can get their food. Like I'm not, not in favor that because if you had like a government place where they had groceries, you can go get your groceries for free.

Speaker 1:          02:13:41       That place is going to be disgusting. So I'm going well cause there's no competition. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. Well maybe no incentive for excellence. Well maybe if it was like a, you know, some kind of a card or something associated like an apple pay type thing. So you just, you go to whatever store you want to. Similar to like a welfare card or a food stand, like food stamps. Yeah, exactly. But a little bit more framed differently. Right. Like you'd have an account with the government where every month you'd get like $1,000 cash and $500 in food. Yeah. Like maybe something like that. Yeah. And then there were rewards for like, you know, moving out of that, like phasing out of that. Right. The Way Andrew Yang has it structured, you would get, everyone would get it, you could opt out of it, like say if you were doing interesting yourself, like you could opt out of it.

Speaker 1:          02:14:22       Oh, that's cool. Yeah, I do like the everything thing because as soon as you decide you make something specifically for a certain population, especially when you're talking about that type of thing, it's not, it doesn't, it doesn't work. I mean conceptually it just better when everyone knows like, oh, you have it. I have it. There's something that binds all of us that we're all in common. Obviously this billionaire doesn't need it, but there's just a precedent for people that make a certain amount of money. They're suggested to like, you know, offset that like put it back into the system so that there's more money, people that need it, whatever. But I think like saying it's for everybody is kind of a smart thing to do. I like that everything everybody is that you have equity in the corporation that is the United States of America. Oh that's interesting. Yeah, that's weird. Particularly if you're thinking about natural resources like a man, when you imagine the enormous profits that someone gets from natural resources.

Speaker 2:          02:15:16       I like the idea that you own the oil that's under the ground. Like is who's decided that like why have we decided that you can go a mile off the ocean, stick a fucking tube in the ground, suck out all the oil and make $1 trillion. Like who said who said you could do that? That's not even your ground. So the, the what the government is giving a license to BP and BP drills, holes a mile off shore and then they suck all the oil out and they make billions. And who's getting that money and how much does the government get and how much is it BP paying for that contract and why doesn't that money go to the people that live in the country? Because if the people live in the country, the countries, the corporation, the corporation is the one that owns this water. Yeah, they're the ones us. So the idea would be that you would, we would all profit from it and they would make substantially less than they make now. And then instead of these people making billions and billions of dollars for something that's not even theirs. Yeah. Like that profit would be split evenly around the country in terms of infrastructure and replenishing impoverished communities and community centers and trying to figure out a way to engineer out all the horrific neighborhoods. Use the natural resources. Yes. I mean that would be

Speaker 1:          02:16:30       wonderful. They've had to pay some people for fracking. They've had to pay some people off because they just ruined their, their, their neighborhood. Like there's people that live in places like fully toxic now. Yes. What do you have, Jamie? I saw this the other day. This is from the original spill and 2004 it's been going on consistently. Oh yeah. It's still leaking. They said the 14 year old Gulf oil spill is leaking up to 4,500 gallons a day. They found that it was many, many times more. Um, oil was leaking out then when they thought it was. So that's still, that's going into the ocean right now from that stupid oil pipeline. Yeah. The quicker that someone figures out the alternative energy, that's kind of what I'm saying. It's like the, it needs to happen. This is ridiculous. It's just, it's, everyone's doing the easy thing right now and it's just feeding the, again, the capitalist mission machine is just like, no, that's okay.

Speaker 1:          02:17:25       That's acceptable. Well, you and I have righteous virtue because we drive electric vehicles occasionally. That's true. I do feel a little bit better. I feel better than people when I drive my Tesla. You assholes poisoning the world, you know? I feel I only feel better driving my Tesla only in that it's just faster. It's just faster than almost everything on the road. It's like time machine. That's the at. That's exactly what I call it. I always say like if there's a location that I want to go to, I appear there. I don't go June over there. It's just like, and you have the 100 d, which is the one I have, which is the two monster one phrase. Meanwhile that fucking new thing that they're coming out with that the roaster. I really want to get my second faster. Zero to 60. Yeah. It's how well one, 1.9, 1.8 theoretically 1.8 seconds here.

Speaker 1:          02:18:17       the 60s changed his uh, his take on that. I think he recently said it's 2.1 are you serious? Yes. Okay. Who were very disciplined very this way. Cause you got to break the two barriers. What kind of nonsense is this? I know. Where's my point? Where's my 10th of a second? Ain't going to matter. Kids fucking thing's ridiculous. Kidding. It's just a fucking weapon. It's insane. But it also has 600 mile range. Yes. That's what I heard. Which is just insane to me. I just love that it's a Tinier car. It's like the fastest thing ever. There's only going to be maybe three other road legal cars that you could buy that would get to that, that level one car at night. They're going to look obsolete compared to that though. Oh yeah. I mean, well, the thing I'm excited about is dependent Farina Electric car. Ooh.

Speaker 1:          02:18:59       All designed completely in house. And I don't know when it comes out, but I don't know if you find a picture of it. It is the nastiest piece of tech. Don't let the Italians make the engine though. Trust. Yeah, I don't think so. I think they're leveraging like, ah, let my people design things. You let them design the way it looks, but all the wires, they're barely paying attention. Standard Girls Asses Heaton Spaghetti. I guarantee you. That's so funny. That's so true. You like Germans and Japanese make reliable cars. Yes. They make their engineers out there get that woo. Damn. That is a Goddamn Batmobile. Yeah. She'd be nasty. Wow. That's a real car. Oh yeah. When's that coming out? Um, I think orders are happening. There you go. That's like 5 million. Jesus. That's it, right? Yeah. Cause all this money coming active eyras how many shakes are there? I mean come on, look, get that fucking, and it borrows a little bit of like Ferrari La Ferrari has little bit of Japanese styling.

Speaker 1:          02:20:00       It has a, it's the perfect blend of like all the good things about like tech looking car and what it's like. It's like a Ferrari four 88 yes. That but one that fuck 1900 Lexus LFA oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's, yeah, I got that hundred 1900 how many Newton? Uh, pounds of Torque. I don't know what that is to say. Whenever they say that Newton meters, I don't get it. Those European ones. And I'm like, what are you saying? I don't feel that. All I know is what is high. And then I base it off of that. It's funny too that we still use horses. I know, I'm stupid as that. I look at that I've seen is people power less than two seconds. So that's like the, but it's an electric vehicle and I'm sure I'm, Jeez biting has one coming out that looks really cool.

Speaker 1:          02:20:47       It was 180 miles an hour, 186 miles an hour and 12 seconds. She says, Chris, so 12 seconds later you're going to 186 miles an hour. [inaudible] control cockpit. Uh, that's what I like about cars like that. I liked that look amazing. It's a fucking house in the hills. They know it. The types in the hills. I'd get it. Wow. If I could, I'd get it. What'd you oh yeah, easily. I definitely want to get the roads. I'm thinking about the roadster. I'm getting that bitch. You got to man. Come on. Got To, I mean it's not that. I mean for 250 grand you're getting a car that like, that's, that's a, what does that, what was it again? To keep chilling us. Jamie, you're just flipping through clothes now. Check out Jamie's on a rabbit hole. You went down the youtube rabbit hole. Lotus was doing, what was the other one was roadster.

Speaker 1:          02:21:34       Oh yeah, that thinks about us. What does the other one Rimac concept to? Oh, I don't know what that, it's a, I think there is downward handle for the roadster. Oh yeah. You slide your finger down. Yeah. Tops. I mean who knows? This is stranded in the pot. It's not, it's not using that steering wheel. I don't know why they do that. They do that for concept cars. That No side view mirrors, which now is actually becoming legal, which is great. Finally, No side view mirrors cause it looks sexier. It looks more sleek. Does it really bother you? That's like if you get a dude and the girl is really hot but she has a chip tooth. Oh go. No, no, no. That makes, that makes, that makes it better. That's like, that's character man. That's beautiful. So why do you need a, why don't you want side mirrors?

Speaker 1:          02:22:14       I want to see it just creates a cleaner line. Fuck a clean line. I want to see what's going on. What have you die? I want to see what's behind me, man. Well, the new Honda all electric car that's basically kind of like a, like a kind of an eagle, but it's a fully new car. It's got, uh, it's got the camera system with the side view mirrors. They're just right on the edge of the Dash, right where the mirrors kind of would be. And the guy, the guy who was doing a review of it, one of the few guys who's gotten to drive it said that it just blows you away. You're like, why haven't cars been like this forever? Because it gives you an accurate fulltime view of what's going on. And the rear view mirror is also a screen. No pillars, no pillars.

Speaker 1:          02:22:55       What are you laughing? I make fun of this car. What am I gonna Fuck? No, go back to the hassle site. Looking at us was only some Honda. It's cute. E I like it. It's also got the most ridiculous turning radius. It's turns tighter than a a London cab. Good. Yeah, because it's got a stick in the ground. Yeah. Just it just plants the pole in the ground and then it just rotates. Yeah. Yeah. The road stairs is evil. I don't think it's really gonna come out in 2020. I don't think so either. I think it's going to get pushed back, but it's just such a gorgeous, it does have some active Arrow, I think in the, the spoilers active. It's cool looking. It looks like what a car supposed to look like in 2020. Exactly. Yes. Reggie Watts. Let's wrap this back. Way Up. Let's do it. People want to follow you on social media. Is that possible? Only if they want to. And it said, um, uh, Reggie Watts at Twitter and uh, Instagram. It's Reggie watts and sometimes Reggie watts.com. That's about it. We gotta do this more often for real. Let's do it. Yeah. It's so much fun. Such a cool journey, man. Really Fun. Really Fun. Thanks for the awesome weed. Purple Venom. Of course. Young Jamie. I loot goodbye everybody.

Speaker 1:          02:24:07       Oh, that was good, man.
