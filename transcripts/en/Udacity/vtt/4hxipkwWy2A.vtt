00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:02.690
To move from one activity -

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:05.090
in this case, the MainActivity
in our Sunshine app,

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:07.493
to another, here the DetailActivity -

00:00:08.223 --> 00:00:10.446
we call StartActivity.

00:00:10.446 --> 00:00:12.930
But note that when using 
the StartActivity method,

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:16.760
rather than specifying the class name 
of the activity to start directly,

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.420
that class name is packaged 
explicitly within an Intent.

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:22.120
The basic premise is simple:

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:24.790
Whenever you need your app components 
to communicate with each other,

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:28.710
or the system, you use Intents 
to identify the target destination.

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.920
Starting activities within your app
is the simplest example...

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.810
with your Intent explicitly indicating
the target using the context

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:43.306
and a class name of the activity.

00:00:43.306 --> 00:00:46.406
Intents that use the name 
of the component you're targeting directly

00:00:46.406 --> 00:00:48.119
are known as Explicit Intents.
