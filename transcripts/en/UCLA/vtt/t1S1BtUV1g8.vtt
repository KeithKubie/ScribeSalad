00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.680
Every one of us should have at least
some sort of basic training

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.265
so if a disaster happened you'd know the basics.

00:00:07.265 --> 00:00:10.280
So it won't be your first time when it actually happens.

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:14.440
At UCLA, due to our geographic location, we face a multitude

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:19.300
of hazards from earthquakes to fires,
floods, active shooter situations.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.840
CERT stands for Community Emergency Response Team.

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.280
We train people right here on campus at UCLA

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:27.460
to be prepared for large-scale disasters.

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.400
I thought it was very important to have a strong presence at UCLA.

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.880
Every day I believe there's 90,000 people that come onto campus

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.660
and in an event that something does happen it is imperative that we are prepared

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.540
CERT Training consists of eight different modules

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.265
taught in class.

00:00:43.265 --> 00:00:46.980
We teach all kinds of hands-on skills that goes from

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.760
basic disaster preparedness, having a kit,

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.860
creating a plan to knowing how do you use a fire extinguisher.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.440
At the very end we also have a live action drill with live victims.

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.860
During the drill, we were
able to practice our concept all the

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:04.820
theory that we learn in class.

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.100
For our drills we use various campus locations

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:13.080
to make it as realistic as possible we
also always invite people to play live victims.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.500
With the blood, the makeup artist
that came in and it was pretty gross

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.520
everyone should take part in CERT
because these are lifelong skills that

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:24.920
you're going to learn.

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.440
My goal with the CERT Club is to give it more of a

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.800
presence on campus where more students are involved. So that way they're more

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.820
prepared in emergency situations so that
the campus can be safer and better

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.420
prepared for disasters.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.980
If you're a staff, student or faculty here at UCLA

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:42.220
and would like to register for one of our classes

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.620
