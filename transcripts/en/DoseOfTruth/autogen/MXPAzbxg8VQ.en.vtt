some people see the flag not as just a
piece of cloth they see it as having

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690
piece of cloth they see it as having

sacred about it which must be protected
 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.670
sacred about it which must be protected
and so so this is true they think of it

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680
and so so this is true they think of it
 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.100
and so so this is true they think of it
as a unifying Center exactly that's

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110
as a unifying Center exactly that's
 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:08.960
as a unifying Center exactly that's
right so if there's something sacred and

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970
right so if there's something sacred and
 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:10.640
right so if there's something sacred and
this is that this is the central piece

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650
this is that this is the central piece
 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.470
this is that this is the central piece
of my work around politics and morality

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480
of my work around politics and morality
 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.310
of my work around politics and morality
is the psychology of sanctity
