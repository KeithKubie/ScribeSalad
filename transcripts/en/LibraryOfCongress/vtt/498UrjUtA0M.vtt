 ALL OF OUR SCHOLARS ARE HERE

AUDIENCE IN BROWN UNIVERSITY 
WITH MY FORMER EMPLOYER, AND MY 

00:10:31.875 --> 00:10:36.805
ALMA MATER MARILYNNE ROBINSON, 
WHEN GIVEN AN HONORARY DEGREE IN

00:10:39.113 --> 00:10:44.180
 2012, I WAS SO FAR THAT YOU 
COULDN'T EVEN SEE HER.  I WILL 

00:10:44.181 --> 00:10:49.845
HAVE A MUCH BETTER SEAT.  AND 
THE DIRECTOR OF THE LIBRARY 

00:10:50.762 --> 00:10:56.905
SPECIALIZED IN AMERICAN HISTORY,
 16TH, 17TH AND 18TH CENTURY AND

00:10:57.877 --> 00:11:01.120
 WE HAVE A SPECIAL THOUGHT OF 
GRATITUDE FOR MARILYNNE TEACHING

00:11:01.373 --> 00:11:08.055
 THE VERY EARLY AMERICANS TO 
OFTEN CONFINE TO THE SO-CALLED 

00:11:08.458 --> 00:11:11.860
HISTORY IN OUR SMALL PART OF THE
 COUNTRY, OUR WONDERFUL BOOKS 

00:11:11.861 --> 00:11:15.947
HAVE ALWAYS FELT LIKE LETTERS 
FROM A FRIEND.  AND SHE IS ALSO 

00:11:15.948 --> 00:11:21.097
OF COURSE A GREAT NATIONAL 
FIGURE AND THAT'S WHY TONIGHT 

00:11:21.439 --> 00:11:23.701
MEANS SO MUCH.  WE HAVE SOME 
EXTRAORDINARY LITERATE

00:11:26.823 --> 00:11:30.294

WELCOMING REMARKS AND IT'S MY 
PLEASURE FOR BEING HERE.  IT'S 

00:11:35.466 --> 00:11:42.358
MY PLEASURE TO INTRODUCE THE 
DIRECTOR OF THE LIBRARY, AND OF

SPEAKER: THANK YOU, TED! IT'S SO

00:11:54.496 --> 00:11:56.496
 GREAT TO SEE ALL OF YOU HERE 

00:11:57.582 --> 00:11:59.582
TONIGHT TO HELP US HONOR THE 
WORK OF MARILYNNE ROBINSON, OUR 

00:12:00.932 --> 00:12:06.163
2016 LIBRARY OF CONGRESS PRIZE 
FOR AMERICAN FICTION. 

00:12:06.164 --> 00:12:10.571
WELCOME TO THE LIBRARY!!
I WANT TO WELCOME THE AUDIENCE, 

00:12:10.572 --> 00:12:11.992
ESPECIALLY THE CONGRESSIONAL 
UNITED CHURCH OF CHRIST IN IOWA 

00:12:11.993 --> 00:12:14.275
CITY, WHERE MARILYNNE SERVED AS 
A DEACON FOR

00:12:18.321 --> 00:12:20.321
 MANY YEARS. 
THE PRIZE IN AMERICAN FICTION 

00:12:22.836 --> 00:12:28.883
STANDS AS ONE OF THE HIGHEST 
HONORS TO A LIVING AMERICAN 

00:12:30.669 --> 00:12:31.893
WRITER.  IT SEEKS TO COMMEND 
STRONG, UNIQUE, ENDURING VOICES 

00:12:31.894 --> 00:12:34.830
THAT HAVE TOLD US SOMETHING NEW 
ABOUT THE AMERICAN EXPERIENCE.

00:12:36.478 --> 00:12:38.478
FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO WEREN'T AT 
THE NATIONAL BOOK FESTIVAL LAST 

00:12:41.888 --> 00:12:46.953
SEPTEMBER WHEN THE LIBRARIAN OF 
CONGRESS PRESENTED MARILYNNE 

00:12:47.223 --> 00:12:52.297
WITH THE PRIZE, I CAN TELL YOU 
OUR WINNER HAD A LIVELY AND 

00:12:54.051 --> 00:12:57.030
INCITEFUL CONVERSATION WITH THE 
FESTIVAL'S LITERARY DIRECTOR, 

00:12:57.754 --> 00:12:59.618
MARIE ARANA.
HOWEVER, NO SINGLE CONVERSATION 

00:12:59.619 --> 00:13:01.619
COULD CAPTURE THE POWER OF 
MARILYNNE'S WORK, WHICH HAS 

00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:05.420
RECEIVED MANY OF THE COUNTRY'S 
OTHER TOP HONORSﾗINCLUDING THE 

00:13:07.761 --> 00:13:09.761
PULITZER PRIZE, THE NATIONAL 
BOOK CRITICS CIRCLE AWARD, AND

THE NATIONAL HUMANITIES MEDAL.

00:13:14.163 --> 00:13:16.163
WHICH BRINGS US TO TONIGHT'S 
EVENT, A CONVERSATION WE'RE 

00:13:18.808 --> 00:13:20.808
CALLING ﾓFICTION, FAITH, AND THE

00:13:23.144 --> 00:13:24.699
 IMAGINATION.ﾔ WE HAVE AN 
AMAZING PANEL HERE WITH US, 

00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:28.117
INCLUDING TWO PULITZER PRIZE 
WINNERSﾗGERALDINE BROOKS; AND 

00:13:31.981 --> 00:13:33.981
PAUL HARDING, WHO STUDIED UNDER 
MARILYNNE AT THE FAMED IOWA 

00:13:34.103 --> 00:13:36.877
WRITERS WORKSHOP.
WE'RE ALSO JOINED BY THE 

00:13:39.714 --> 00:13:43.229
RENOWNED AMERICAN PHYSICIST, 
ALAN LIGHT

00:13:49.997 --> 00:13:52.299
MAN, AND STEVEN KNAPP WILL 
MODERATE THE DISCUSSION. 

00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:54.300
AND OF COURSE, MARILYNNE IS HERE

00:13:55.508 --> 00:14:01.438
 TONIGHT WITH US AS WELL.  ONE 
OF MARILYNNE'S GREATEST ADMIRERS

00:14:01.439 --> 00:14:03.439
 IS

00:14:04.645 --> 00:14:05.571
 FORMER PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA. 

00:14:05.572 --> 00:14:07.572
HE COULDN'T JOIN US TONIGHT, BUT
 HE HAS SENT A SPECIAL SURPRISE 

00:14:08.197 --> 00:14:10.197
MESSAGE FOR MARILYNNE.  

00:14:11.893 --> 00:14:13.893
PLEASE LET ME READ

00:14:17.438 --> 00:14:19.179
 OBAMA'S WORDS. 
ﾓLIKE MOST AMERICANS, I FIRST 

00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:20.746
MET MARILYNNE ROBINSON ON THE 
PAGES OF ONE OF HER 

00:14:20.747 --> 00:14:22.132
EXTRAORDINARY NOVELS. FOR ME, IT
 WAS GILEAD, A BOOK I'D PICKED 

00:14:22.133 --> 00:14:25.887
UP AS I WAS BARNSTORMING ACROSS 
IOWA DURING MY FIRST CAMPAIGN 

00:14:27.851 --> 00:14:30.579
FOR PRESIDENT. IN IT, I MET 
FOLKS WHO WERE DECENT AND 

00:14:33.476 --> 00:14:35.476
GOOD-HEARTED, FULL OF THEIR OWN 
COMPLEXITIES AND STRUGGLES.

00:14:40.165 --> 00:14:42.165
I WAS ABSORBED INTO A STORY THAT
 GRAPPLES EQUALLY WITH THE 

00:14:42.781 --> 00:14:44.781
BLOSSOMS AND THE THORNS IN OUR 
RELATIONSHIPS - WITH EACH OTHER,

00:14:45.197 --> 00:14:47.078
 WITH OURSELVES, WITH OUR 
CREATOR - AND STILL MANAGES TO 

00:14:47.079 --> 00:14:49.664
ACHIEVE A LEVEL OF GRACE THAT 
WE'RE ALL 

00:14:54.086 --> 00:14:56.086
STRIVING FOR IN OUR OWN LIVES.
THAT'S WHAT MARILYNNE DOES SO 

00:14:56.767 --> 00:14:58.767
BRILLIANTLY. SHE NOT ONLY DRAWS 

00:15:00.107 --> 00:15:02.107
US INTO THE TEXTURE OF THE 
PEOPLE AND COMMUNITIES SHE 

00:15:02.981 --> 00:15:04.981
CREATES, BUT WRAPS US ALL 

00:15:08.551 --> 00:15:10.551
TOGETHER IN SOMETHING LARGER, A 
PATCHWORK OF CHARACTERS AND 

00:15:11.358 --> 00:15:13.358
READERS AND AUTHOR; OF OUR 
STRUGGLES AND OUR DELIGHTS; OF 

00:15:15.854 --> 00:15:18.226
OUR FAITH, OUR DOUBTS, OUR 
REDEMPTION. AND IN DOING SO, SHE

00:15:19.796 --> 00:15:21.879
 ELEVATES OUR UNDERSTANDING OF 
WHAT IT MEANS TO BE FULLY HUMAN.

00:15:26.354 --> 00:15:28.354
THAT'S WHAT THE HIGHEST OF ART 
CAN ACHIEVE. IT'S WHAT THE 

00:15:28.801 --> 00:15:30.801
GREATEST LIBRARY IN THE WORLD 

00:15:32.349 --> 00:15:34.349
SHOULD CELEBRATE. AND IT'S WHAT 
MARILYNNE ROBINSON SEEMS TO 

00:15:36.204 --> 00:15:38.204
RADIATE EVERY TIME SHE SITS DOWN
 TO WRITE.

00:15:41.636 --> 00:15:43.636
SO I WANT TO ONCE AGAIN 
CONGRATULATE MY FRIEND, 

00:15:43.884 --> 00:15:45.884
MARILYNNE, ON HER DISTINGUISHED 
AWARD. AND I WANT TO THANK YOU 

00:15:46.705 --> 00:15:48.705
ALL FOR GATHERING TOGETHER 
TONIGHT FOR SOMETHING THAT, FOR 

00:15:50.243 --> 00:15:52.243
MARILYNNE, MIGHT BE AN EVEN 

00:15:55.573 --> 00:15:58.098
GREATER REWARD A THOUGHTFUL, 
LIVELY CONVERSATION ON SOME OF 

00:15:58.854 --> 00:16:00.854
THE TOPICS DEAR TO ALL OF OUR 
HEARTS. HAVE A GREAT NIGHT, 

00:16:02.255 --> 00:16:07.315
EVERYONE.ﾔ ON THAT LOVELY NOTE, 
FROM PRESIDENT OBAMA, PLEASE LET

00:16:09.588 --> 00:16:14.252
 ME TURN THE EVENING OVER TO 
STEVEN KNAPP.  [APPLAUSE]. 

00:16:24.755 --> 00:16:28.890
IT'S A PLEASURE TO WELCOME YOU. 
AND I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE

00:16:33.007 --> 00:16:38.690
 SENATECENTER FOR POETRY AND THE
 KLUGE CENTER AND THOSE WHO ARE 

00:16:39.221 --> 00:16:41.221
RESPECTIVELY HOSTING THIS EVENT 
HERE AT THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS.

00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:45.828
AND I WANT TO SAY HOW PROUD I AM
 TO BE MODERATING SUCH A 

00:16:46.630 --> 00:16:49.184
DISTINGUISHED PANEL.  AS YOU 
HAVE ALREADY HEARD, I DO THINK 

00:16:49.982 --> 00:16:53.840
THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS DONE A 
GREAT JOB OPENING THE DISCUSSION

00:16:54.423 --> 00:16:58.764
 FOR THE PANEL.  I WANT TO SAY A
 FEW THINGS BEFORE I POSE 

00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:01.867
QUESTIONS TO THE PANELISTS.  OUR
 TOPIC IS BETWEEN FAITH AND 

00:17:02.130 --> 00:17:04.130
IMAGINATION AND

00:17:07.271 --> 00:17:12.054
 INFLICTION IN THE WAY MARILYNNE
 ROBINSON HAS THE COVENANT 

00:17:12.055 --> 00:17:14.055
CONCEPTION

00:17:15.356 --> 00:17:23.363
 OF BRACE AND DOES SO IN PART, 
THROUGH THE ELABORATION AND 

00:17:23.364 --> 00:17:27.129
TRANSPOSITION THROUGH THE MOST 
FAMOUS DEPICTION IN

00:17:30.907 --> 00:17:32.907
 DEFYING GRACE

00:17:35.456 --> 00:17:39.871
 IN THE GOSPEL OF LUKE.  FATHER 
GRANTS THE REQUEST.  GOES OFF.  

00:17:40.723 --> 00:17:45.189
AND SQUANDERS THROUGH LIVING AND
 RETURNS HOME IMPOVERISHED AND 

00:17:45.397 --> 00:17:50.746
DISGRACED.  FATHER WANTS TO 
FORGIVE HIM.  BUT AMAZING LY 

00:17:50.914 --> 00:17:55.015
THERE WAS A PARTY IN HIS HONOR. 
HIS SON WHO WAS OBEDIENT OBJECTS

00:17:55.186 --> 00:17:57.614
 TO THE SPECIAL TREATMENT

00:18:00.745 --> 00:18:08.220
 AND EXPLAINING THAT THIS LEVEL 
WAS YOURS WAS LOST AND NOW 

00:18:09.102 --> 00:18:13.129
FOUND.  
IT PORTRAYED ROBINSON'S 

00:18:15.416 --> 00:18:18.717
TRILOLOGY.  HOME BEGINS WITH A 
CHILD AND THE FATHER.  AND THIS 

00:18:19.088 --> 00:18:24.742
TIME A YOUNGER SISTER AND NOT A 
BROTHER.  AND MISPLACED TRUST OF

00:18:25.221 --> 00:18:29.189
 THE FIANC￉E WHO WAS NOT GREETED
 BY ANY SORT OF PARTY AND HAD 

00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:33.900
THE OBEDIENT CARE GIVER OF HER 
ALIEN FATHER,

00:18:37.970 --> 00:18:40.399
 PRESBYTERIAN ROBERT.  
AND OLDER BROTHER JACK SOON 

00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:46.417
COMES HOME AS WELL AND DIFFICULT
 AND NEVER QUITE FINISHED 

00:18:46.533 --> 00:18:51.647
RECONCILIATION WITH THE FATHER. 
JACK, THE FATHER'S FAVORITE 

00:18:53.119 --> 00:18:58.919
DESPITE HIS DELINQUENT CHILDHOOD
 LEAVES AFTER THE ACT.  AND IN 

00:18:59.315 --> 00:19:03.732
THE SIN OF HIS FATHER'S EYES AND
 KNOWN REDEMPTION.  MARRIAGE TO 

00:19:04.033 --> 00:19:08.603
THE AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMAN OF A 
MIXED RACE SON.  JACK'S WIFE SON

00:19:09.133 --> 00:19:12.733
 ROBERT SHOWS UP AT THE FAMILY 
HOME AFTER JACK HAS LEFT.  AND 

00:19:12.946 --> 00:19:19.328
GLORY AND NOW THE FATHER FINDS 
OUT THE TRUTH.  AND ENDS WITH 

00:19:19.721 --> 00:19:23.729
GLORY IN THE OWN IMAGINATION.  
THE DAY JACK'S SON ROBERT WILL 

00:19:24.106 --> 00:19:27.391
RETURN TO THE HOMESTEAD TRULY 
ANSWERING HIS FATHER'S PRAYERS 

00:19:27.801 --> 00:19:31.756
IN A WAY THAT JACK NEVER 
ANSWERED HIS OWN PRAYERS.  AND 

00:19:32.130 --> 00:19:35.914
THAT IS THE LONG DELAYED BUT 
MERCIFUL EXPRESSION OF

00:19:38.996 --> 00:19:46.183
 GOD'S GRACE.  NOW IT SCRATCHES 
THE SURFACE OF THE GRACE AND 

00:19:49.226 --> 00:19:55.099
PROTAGONIST OF THE NOVEL "JOHN 
AIMS" AND RELIGIOUSLY LESS 

00:19:55.523 --> 00:20:01.155
EDUCATED YOUNGER BROTHER LAYA, 
AND THE THIRD NOVEL.  A LOOK AT 

00:20:01.331 --> 00:20:05.607
THE EXPLORATION AND GRACE.  IT'S
 NOT JUST THE PERSONAL ANGLE 

00:20:05.608 --> 00:20:10.650
FROM WHICH SHE APPROACHES IT, 
BUT THE SUBTLE WAY IN WHICH SHE 

00:20:10.651 --> 00:20:13.752
CONNECTS THE STORIES WITH 
MOVEMENTS AND EVENTS THAT HAVE 

00:20:13.753 --> 00:20:17.873
FORMED OR AROUND THEM.  
ABOLITIONISM, CIVIL WAR, DUST 

00:20:18.129 --> 00:20:21.459
BOWL, GREAT DEPRESSION, THE 
BEGINNING OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS 

00:20:21.591 --> 00:20:28.020
MOVEMENT.  THE TRILOLOGY, THESE 
ARE HISTORY, AND SOMETIMES HAUNT

00:20:28.159 --> 00:20:32.081
 THE PRESENT AND SOMETIMES 
VIOLENTLY IN THE SURFACE OF THE 

00:20:32.278 --> 00:20:36.261
NARRATIVE.  SO TONIGHT I WOULD 
LIKE TO START A DISCUSSION.  AND

00:20:37.138 --> 00:20:43.014
 I WOULD START WITH YOU 
GERALDINE BROOKS.  OUR TOPIC IS 

00:20:43.015 --> 00:20:45.015
"FICTION FAITH AND THE 
IMAGINATION."  AS

00:20:46.296 --> 00:20:47.482
 I JUST SUGGESTED, ONE OF THE 
FASCINATING ELEMENTS OF 

00:20:47.483 --> 00:20:49.433
MARILYNNE ROBINSON'S FICTION IS 
THE WAY SHE WEAVES TOGETHER 

00:20:49.434 --> 00:20:51.434
RELIGIOUS CONCERNS AND A RICH 

00:20:52.690 --> 00:20:57.381
HISTORICAL CONTEXT AND THERE IS 
A SENSE IN THE 

00:21:00.641 --> 00:21:04.217
LOVELY.  
SPEAKER:  ROBINSON'S NOVEL IN 

00:21:04.485 --> 00:21:09.427
THE NEAR PAST IS NOT 
TRADITIONALLY WHAT WOULD BE 

00:21:10.232 --> 00:21:15.970
DESCRIBED AS HISTORICAL FICTION.
IT'S LIKE WHAT I LIKE TO THINK 

00:21:17.357 --> 00:21:19.704
OF HENRY JAMES' DESIGNATED SAFE 
SON.  BECAUSE JAMES HAD ANY 

00:21:20.054 --> 00:21:25.587
ATTEMPT TO WRITE ABOUT A PERIOD 
MORE THAN 50 YEARS REMOVED FROM 

00:21:26.237 --> 00:21:35.473
ONE'S OWN AND SHOULD NOT BE 
ATTEMPTED BECAUSE THE OLD 

00:21:35.587 --> 00:21:39.757
CONSCIOUSNESS WOULD BE TO LIST 
TO US.  ACTUALLY IF YOU THINK 

00:21:40.141 --> 00:21:44.673
ABOUT IT, IF YOU'RE A NOVELIST 
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE JOURNEY OF 

00:21:44.787 --> 00:21:50.547
YOUR LIFE, THAT 50-YEAR WINDOW 
ADDED TO THE 50 YEARS OF YOUR 

00:21:50.831 --> 00:21:55.898
OWN EXPERIENCE GIVES YOU AN 
ENTIRE CENTURY IN WHICH TO PRY 

00:21:56.020 --> 00:21:59.967
YOUR TRADE.  WHICH IS NOT 
UNGENEROUS TO IT AT TIMES.  AND 

00:22:02.151 --> 00:22:05.897
I THINK IN THE CASE OF 
MARILYNNE'S NOVEL, THIS IS VERY

00:22:08.948 --> 00:22:15.108
 IMPORTANT.  BECAUSE I CAN'T 
IMAGINE GULIAD SET OFF TO 1960. 

00:22:15.633 --> 00:22:18.893
I THINK IT'S MUCH BETTER SET IN 
THE SLIGHTLY MORE DISTANT PAST. 

00:22:19.244 --> 00:22:23.257
PERHAPS, IF YOU WANTED TO LOOK 
FOR A DIVIDING LINE, IT WOULD BE

00:22:23.595 --> 00:22:31.661
 BEFORE, AND COULD POSSIBLY HAVE
 A TIME MAGAZINE COVER THAT SAID

00:22:31.992 --> 00:22:40.111
 IS GOD DEAD?  I THINK YOU'RE IN
 A TIME PERIOD WHERE THE 

00:22:41.599 --> 00:22:44.843
MATERIALISTIC SKEPTICISM HAS NOT
 BEEN SOCIAL FABRIC OF AT LEAST 

00:22:45.165 --> 00:22:48.831
THE ENGLISH SPEAKING WORLD TO 
THE EXTENT IT HAPPENED AFTER THE

00:22:50.021 --> 00:22:52.021
 '60S AND IT

00:22:53.978 --> 00:23:00.759
 REMINDS ME OF OUR WONDERFUL 
ESSAY BY JAMES WARD IN HIS 

00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:06.812
COLLECTION IN THE BOOK "ESTATES"
 AND WHEN HE TALKS ABOUT THE 

00:23:06.813 --> 00:23:08.813
NOVEL ITSELF WAS, IN A

00:23:13.112 --> 00:23:17.425
 WAY, CORROSIVE TO FAITH.  
BECAUSE THE NOVEL IS IN AS-IF 

00:23:17.745 --> 00:23:22.001
FORM.  YOU'RE CREATING AS IF.  
BUT YOU'RE NOT CREATING 

00:23:22.343 --> 00:23:30.534
CERTAINTY.  AND HE TALKS ABOUT 
THE VERY FEW BILLION WRITERS 

00:23:30.674 --> 00:23:35.081
THAT ARE ABLE TO RETAIN 
RELIGIOUS ELEMENTS IN THEIR FIX 

00:23:35.924 --> 00:23:38.628
WITH THE TRUE BELIEF IN FICTION 
ITSELF AND THE PURPOSES OF 

00:23:38.769 --> 00:23:43.906
FICTION.  AND HE SINGLES OUT 
WOLF AND TALKS ABOUT GENTLE 

00:23:44.541 --> 00:23:50.135
VALUE THAT SHE HAS BETWEEN 
RELIGION AND I THINK THAT 

00:23:50.546 --> 00:23:52.546
MARILYNNE ROBINSON IS NOT A

00:23:58.569 --> 00:24:02.185
 GENTLE ONE, BUT PASSIONATE.  
AND I THINK IT WORKS VERY 

00:24:02.413 --> 00:24:07.739
BEAUTIFULLY.  BECAUSE SHE SEES 
THE MYSTICAL AND THE RELIGIOUS 

00:24:08.146 --> 00:24:14.141
IN THE ORDINARY.  IT DOESN'T 
HAVE TO BE A VIRGIN BIRTH TO BE 

00:24:14.279 --> 00:24:18.600
WONDERFUL.  BECAUSE ANY BIRTH IS
 A MIRACLE.  YOUNG SON SO 

00:24:18.830 --> 00:24:22.092
BEAUTIFULLY EVOKED AND 
DEMONSTRATED AND I THINK OF THAT

00:24:22.647 --> 00:24:28.079
 WONDERFUL PASSAGE WHERE AIMS 
REFLECTS THAT LIFE IS CONSTANT. 

00:24:28.327 --> 00:24:34.928
AND WE JUST TURN OVER IN IT.  
AND EVERY DAY IS ONE DAY.  AND 

00:24:35.209 --> 00:24:38.671
ONCE YOU HAVE THAT THOUGHT, THEN
 WHO NEEDS TO ARGUE WHETHER THE 

00:24:39.324 --> 00:24:44.873
WORLD WAS CREATED IN SIX DAYS?  
IT BECOMES A MAGNIFICENT

00:24:49.177 --> 00:24:53.342
 IRRELEVANCY.  
SPEAKER:  THANK YOU SO MUCH.  

00:24:54.066 --> 00:24:58.297
YOU ALSO HAVE THE SPECULATIVE 
NOVEL ABOUT THE ALTERNATE 

00:24:58.731 --> 00:25:05.590
REALITY AND SCIENTISTS IN RECENT
 YEARS, AND THIS LEADS TO THE 

00:25:06.676 --> 00:25:11.527
CORROSIVE MATERIALISM THAT, YOU 
KNOW, WAS MENTIONED.  YOU NOTICE

00:25:11.657 --> 00:25:15.908
 HOW THE THOUGHTS OF CRITICAL 
RELIGION HAVE EVIDENCE-BASED 

00:25:16.391 --> 00:25:18.391
REASONING WITH CONTRAST AND

00:25:20.149 --> 00:25:25.132
 RELIANCE ON FAITH.  AND 
EXPANDING THE SCIENCE IN FAITH, 

00:25:25.262 --> 00:25:28.527
WHAT'S YOUR TAKE ON THAT?  DOES 
FAITH PLAY A ROLE IN SCIENCE?  

00:25:29.010 --> 00:25:33.754
IF SO, WHAT KIND OF FAITH?  HOW 
DO YOU KEEP THAT IN YOUR OWN 

00:25:33.919 --> 00:25:39.427
IMAGINATION IN THE WORLD OF 
RELIGION AND SCIENCE?  

00:25:39.428 --> 00:25:43.569
SPEAKER:  I THINK FOR ME FAITH 
IS SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN'T 

00:25:43.704 --> 00:25:46.978
PROVE.  AND THE FOCUS IS THAT 
EVERYTHING THAT SCIENCE 

00:25:47.103 --> 00:25:51.353
BELIEVES, IT CAN PROVE.  AND 
NOTHING THAT RELIGION

00:25:55.598 --> 00:25:57.598
 BELIEVES 

00:25:59.477 --> 00:26:03.627
IT CAN PROVE.  I THINK THAT 
SCIENCE AND RELIGION HAVE VERY 

00:26:04.077 --> 00:26:06.077
DIFFERENT METHODS OF

00:26:12.709 --> 00:26:15.522
 ARRIVING AT THEIR BELIEFS.  I 
THINK THERE IS

00:26:19.060 --> 00:26:23.894
 FAITH AND RELIGION AND BOTH.  
FAITH IS VERY VERY FUNDAMENTAL 

00:26:23.895 --> 00:26:27.123
FOR WHAT SCIENTISTS HAVE.  IT'S 
SOMETHING THAT ONE MIGHT CALL 

00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:33.540
THE CENTRAL DOCTRINE OF SCIENCE.
AND THE CENTRAL DOCTRINE OF 

00:26:34.603 --> 00:26:36.603
SCIENCE IS

00:26:40.792 --> 00:26:46.444
 THAT THE UNIVERSE IS THOUGHTFUL
 AND LOGICAL.  IT'S A DOCTRINE 

00:26:46.445 --> 00:26:51.799
THAT WE SCIENTISTS LEARN AS 
GRADUATE STUDENTS AND WE MAY NOT

00:26:52.006 --> 00:26:54.451
 LEARN IT CONSCIOUSLY.
BUT IT'S SORT OF IN THE AIR. 

00:27:00.270 --> 00:27:03.900
INTO THE SKIN.  IT'S A 
FUNDAMENTAL WORKING BELIEF THAT 

00:27:04.129 --> 00:27:07.846
SCIENTISTS HAVE.  AND IT'S A 
BELIEF THAT CAN'T BE PROVED.  IT

00:27:08.304 --> 00:27:10.304
 HAS TO BE

00:27:11.683 --> 00:27:14.264
 TAKEN ON FAITH.  
BECAUSE NO MATTER HOW MUCH 

00:27:15.054 --> 00:27:22.025
SCIENCE KNOWS AND NO MATTER HOW 
SUCCESSFUL OUR THEORIES ARE, 

00:27:22.158 --> 00:27:26.712
THEY'RE INCOMPLETE.  THERE ARE 
THINGS THAT WE DON'T KNOW WHICH 

00:27:27.029 --> 00:27:30.011
MARILYNNE HAS TALKED ABOUT.  AND
 THINGS THAT SCIENCE DOESN'T 

00:27:30.454 --> 00:27:32.454
KNOW. 

00:27:34.263 --> 00:27:36.263
 AND WE

00:27:37.982 --> 00:27:44.239
 CAN'T BE CERTAIN THAT ALL PARTS
 OF UNIVERSE ARE LOGICAL.  WE 

00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:47.198
DON'T KNOW IF NEW PARTS OF 
TOMORROW WILL BE LAWFUL AND 

00:27:47.412 --> 00:27:51.747
LOGICAL.  WE CAN'T BE CERTAIN.  
SO THE BELIEF AND THE CENTRAL 

00:27:51.748 --> 00:27:56.662
DOCTRINE THAT EVERYTHING IN THE 
PHYSICAL UNIVERSE IS LAWFUL AND 

00:27:56.857 --> 00:28:03.144
LOGICAL, THAT IS SOMETHING THAT 
HAS TO BE TAKEN ON FAITH.  

00:28:03.145 --> 00:28:07.147
SPEAKER:  SO YOU MENTIONED 
SPECIAL INTEREST AND RELATION 

00:28:07.875 --> 00:28:10.329
BETWEEN PHYSICAL AND 
NON-PHYSICAL PERCEPTIONS OF 

00:28:10.531 --> 00:28:14.038
REALITY.  CAN YOU TELL US A 
LITTLE MORE ABOUT THAT?  AS 

00:28:14.771 --> 00:28:18.672
OPPOSED TO WHAT YOU JUST THINK 
ABOUT THE NON-PHYSICAL.  

00:28:18.673 --> 00:28:21.987
SPEAKER:  WELL, MARILYNNE HAS 
WRITTEN WUFLY ABOUT

00:28:26.096 --> 00:28:35.013
 SCIENCE AND RELIGION.  AND SHE 
SUGGESTS IN HER WRITING THAT WE 

00:28:35.014 --> 00:28:38.631
MAKE TOO MUCH OF A DEAL OUT OF 
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE 

00:28:38.632 --> 00:28:44.381
PHYSICAL AND NON-PHYSICAL.  BUT 
WE MAKE TOO BIG OF A DISTINCT 

00:28:44.382 --> 00:28:48.457
FOR WHAT SHE SAYS.  AND PLEASE 
CORRECT ME, I DON'T KNOW IF I AM

00:28:50.036 --> 00:28:57.036
 GIVING IT WRONG.  BUT SHE SAYS 
THAT BECAUSE THE KNOWLEDGE OF 

00:28:57.037 --> 00:28:59.037
SCIENCE ABOUT THE PHYSICAL

00:29:01.053 --> 00:29:03.053
 UNIVERSE IS

00:29:06.847 --> 00:29:12.497
 INCOMPLETE, THAT WE CAN'T 
CONFIDENTLY MAKE AN OPPOSITION 

00:29:15.091 --> 00:29:18.811
OF THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE BECAUSE
 WE DON'T FULLY UNDERSTAND THE 

00:29:19.806 --> 00:29:21.905
PHYSICAL UNIVERSE.  WELL, I 
AGREE WITH PART OF THAT.  AND 

00:29:22.282 --> 00:29:24.744
NOT ALL OF IT.  I DO AGREE THAT 
THE KNOWLEDGE OF SCIENCE ABOUT 

00:29:24.956 --> 00:29:30.855
THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE IS 
INCOMPLETE.  BUT FOR ME AS BOTH 

00:29:31.844 --> 00:29:37.041
A SCIENTIST AND A HUMANIST AND 
IF I CAN SAY, A SPIRITUAL 

00:29:37.510 --> 00:29:40.930
PERSON, I THINK THAT THE 
DISTINCT BETWEEN THE PHYSICAL 

00:29:41.071 --> 00:29:49.775
AND THE NON-PHYSICAL UNIVERSES 
IS VERY IMPORTANT.  AND I THINK 

00:29:51.401 --> 00:29:54.261
THAT THERE ARE EXPERIENCES THAT 
WE HAVE AND PROBABLY EVERYBODY 

00:29:54.410 --> 00:29:58.907
HERE HAS HAD THEM.  AND YOU CAN 
CALL THEM TRANSCENDING 

00:29:59.334 --> 00:30:03.513
EXPERIENCES.  BUT SCIENCE WILL 
NEVER BE ABLE TO EXPLAIN EVEN IN

00:30:03.514 --> 00:30:10.858
 PRINCIPLE, WILL NEVER BE ABLE 
TO FULLY COMPREHEND.  YOU CAN 

00:30:10.859 --> 00:30:17.273
HOOK 100 BILLION ELECTRODES TO 
MY NEURONS AND MEASURE EVERY 

00:30:17.870 --> 00:30:20.831
ELECTRICAL OUTPUT OF EACH 
NEURON.  BUT THAT WILL NOT

00:30:25.630 --> 00:30:30.958
 EXPLAIN THE EXPERIENCE THAT I 
HAVE IN LOOKING OR FEELING LIKE 

00:30:31.162 --> 00:30:35.418
THERE IS SOMETHING LARGER THAN 
MYSELF.  THAT, TO ME, IS PART OF

00:30:36.089 --> 00:30:40.995
 THE NON-PHYSICAL UNIVERSE.  IF 
WE BELIEVE IN GOD,

00:30:44.030 --> 00:30:49.636
 IF GOD EXISTS, IN EVERY 
RELIGION THAT I KNOW OF HAS A 

00:30:49.637 --> 00:30:55.141
CONCEPTION OF GOD, IN WHICH GOD 
DOES NOT LOVE IN TIME AND SPACE.

00:30:55.142 --> 00:31:00.612
  GOD IS NOT SUBJECT TO LAWS AND
 RULES.  SO GOD WOULD ALSO BE A 

00:31:00.613 --> 00:31:06.218
PART OF WHAT I WOULD CALL THE 
NON-PHYSICAL UNIVERSE.  ON THE 

00:31:06.219 --> 00:31:11.076
OTHER HAND, I AM A STRONG 
SUBSCRIBER TO THE CENTRAL 

00:31:11.077 --> 00:31:16.792
DOCTRINE OF SCIENCE.  
HAVING SAID ALL OF THAT.  AND I 

00:31:16.793 --> 00:31:22.714
DO THINK THERE IS A VAST RANGE 
OF PHENOMENON THAT SCIENCE DOES 

00:31:22.858 --> 00:31:25.001
UNDERSTAND AND SCIENCE CAN 
EXPLAIN AND IS SUBJECT TO THE 

00:31:25.148 --> 00:31:29.053
LAWS THAT WE UNDERSTAND.  AND I 
CALL THAT THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE.

00:31:29.298 --> 00:31:35.713
SO I NEED TO HAVE A DISTINCT 
BETWEEN THOSE TWO UNIVERSES TO 

00:31:36.155 --> 00:31:41.904
LIVE A LIFE BOTH AS A SCIENTIST 
AND AS A HUMANIST.  

00:31:41.905 --> 00:31:46.397
SPEAKER:  TALK ABOUT SOMETHING 
ABOUT HOW YOUR INTERESTS FIT 

00:31:46.687 --> 00:31:54.396
INTO THAT, YOUR INTEREST IN 
FICTION ITSELF TO SUPPOSE THAT 

00:31:56.107 --> 00:31:58.660
DISTINCTION.  
SPEAKER:  WELL, I WROTE A BOOK, 

00:31:59.128 --> 00:32:05.850
A NOVEL CALLED "MR. G" AND THAT 
IS A LOWER CASE G STANDING FOR 

00:32:06.278 --> 00:32:09.884
GOD AND IT'S A BOOK THAT TELLS 
THE STORY OF CREATION FROM A 

00:32:10.121 --> 00:32:13.615
POINT OF VIEW OF GOD.  AND GOD 
IS THE NARRATOR OF THE BOOK.  

00:32:13.883 --> 00:32:20.462
GOD HAS AN UNCLE AND AN AUNT WHO
 ARE ALWAYS CRITICIZING HIM FOR 

00:32:24.366 --> 00:32:33.007
NOT GETTING THINGS RIGHT.  AND 
THE UNIVERSE THAT GOD CREATES IS

00:32:33.143 --> 00:32:35.143
 A

00:32:37.225 --> 00:32:40.536
 LAWFUL UNIVERSE.  GOD CONSIDERS
 THE POSSIBILITY OF ENTERING THE

00:32:40.802 --> 00:32:44.455
 UNIVERSE AND INTERVENING AND 
PERFORMING MIRACLES WHICH COULD 

00:32:44.456 --> 00:32:49.480
BE UNLAWFUL AND DILATE THE 
CENTRAL DOCTRINE OF SCIENCE.  

00:32:49.481 --> 00:32:51.481
AND GOD CHOOSES NOT TO DO THAT. 

00:32:54.774 --> 00:33:03.109
 AND FOR ME, THIS WAS AN 
IMPORTANT EXPLORATION FROM ME TO

00:33:03.334 --> 00:33:06.414
 THINK ABOUT HOW THE PHYSICAL 
AND THE SPIRITUAL UNIVERSES 

00:33:06.415 --> 00:33:09.638
COULD EXIST IN HARMONY WITH EACH
 OTHER WITHOUT

00:33:15.633 --> 00:33:19.502
 ANY CON  TRADICTION.  
SPEAKER:  WE TALKED ABOUT HOW 

00:33:19.958 --> 00:33:23.985
THE IMAGINATION NEGOTIATES THE 
PATH BETWEEN THE PHYSICAL AND 

00:33:24.276 --> 00:33:29.066
NON-PHYSICAL INFORMATION AND 
EXPERIENCE.  BY THE WAY, I I 

00:33:23.352 --> 00:33:25.352
WANT

00:33:26.672 --> 00:33:28.015
  TO SHIFT

00:33:28.016 --> 00:33:30.016
 TO A PERSONAL

00:33:31.904 --> 00:33:37.464
 TAKE ON WHY THIS IS TRUE.  AND 
AS A TEACHER, OF COURSE, I WANT 

00:33:37.465 --> 00:33:40.207
YOU TO SAY WHAT THAT EXPERIENCE 
WAS LIKE.  AND DOES THE 

00:33:40.208 --> 00:33:43.386
INTERSECTION OF FAITH AND 
IMAGINATION ALSO PLAY A ROLE IN 

00:33:43.387 --> 00:33:45.952
THE CLASSROOM, IN HER CLASSROOM?

00:33:45.953 --> 00:33:48.077
SPEAKER:  WELL I CAN SAY IT

00:33:51.151 --> 00:33:56.413
 WAS A GOOD EXPERIENCE.  AND I 
HAD THE EXPERIENCE OF HAVING 

00:33:56.414 --> 00:33:58.414
BEEN A DRUMMER IN A ROCK

00:34:03.368 --> 00:34:08.067
 BAND FOR MANY YEARS.  AND THE 
ROCK BAND BROKE UP AND IT BECAME

00:34:08.068 --> 00:34:13.563
 TIME FOR ME TO GET A JOB.  AND 
FOR THAT PROSPECT, I THOUGHT I 

00:34:13.564 --> 00:34:17.140
ABOUT JUST GO TO GRAD SCHOOL.  
AND A LOT OF WRITERS, PEOPLE 

00:34:17.141 --> 00:34:19.868
BECOME WRITERS. 
AND I WAS A READER.  AND I 

00:34:20.048 --> 00:34:23.367
THOUGHT OF MYSELF AS A WRITER 
BEFORE I WROTE ANYTHING.  I 

00:34:23.494 --> 00:34:27.298
WOULD WALK AROUND SAYING I HAVE 
A WRITER IN THE FAMILY AND I 

00:34:27.420 --> 00:34:31.703
FINALLY HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO 
CREATE A FICTION WRITING CLASS 

00:34:31.947 --> 00:34:37.364
IN COLLEGE AT SARATOGA.  AND 
JUST BY THE LUCK OF LOTTERY, I 

00:34:37.553 --> 00:34:40.999
SIGNED UP FOR A CLASS AND 
MARILYNNE ROBINSON WALKED IN.  

00:34:41.122 --> 00:34:44.618
AND WITHIN TEN MINUTES OF HER 
STARTING TO TALK ABOUT THE LIFE 

00:34:44.742 --> 00:34:51.467
OF THE MIND, SPIRITUALITY, 
HISTORY, I KNEW THE LIFE I 

00:34:52.347 --> 00:34:59.615
WANTED FOR MY OWN MIND.  TRY TO 
EMULATE THAT.  AND LUCKY ENOUGH 

00:34:59.862 --> 00:35:04.631
TO BE ABLE TO FOLLOW HER UP TO 
THE WRITERS WORKSHOP AT THE 

00:35:04.755 --> 00:35:08.614
UNIVERSITY OF IOWA AND I THINK 
THE DAY I FOUND OUT I GOT INTO 

00:35:09.809 --> 00:35:13.733
IOWA IS THE DAY THAT I FOUND OUT
 SHE WON THE LIVING AWARD AND I 

00:35:14.013 --> 00:35:19.832
WAS NOT GOING TO BE IN IOWA.  
AND SO I HAD TO MAKE MY BREAKS. 

00:35:20.086 --> 00:35:24.422
AND SO SHE TAUGHT A CLASS IN THE
 OLD TESTAMENT AT THE 

00:35:24.558 --> 00:35:27.928
CONGREGATIONAL CHURCH IN IOWA 
CITY.  AND I THINK THAT WAS THE 

00:35:28.044 --> 00:35:33.642
FIRST TIME THAT I SAID THE OLD 
TESTAMENT WITH HER.  AND I USE 

00:35:35.186 --> 00:35:38.697
THE ANALOGY BEFORE.  THE 
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SITTING IN 

00:35:38.951 --> 00:35:42.701
THE SEMINAR ROOM AND STUDYING 
PARADISE LAST AND SITTING IN A 

00:35:42.829 --> 00:35:47.264
SEMINAR ROOM WITH JOHN NELSON.  
IT REALLY IS THAT PROFOUND. 

00:35:52.526 --> 00:35:58.343
 AND SHE TAUGHT ME FELLOWSHIP 
AND TREAT OTHER HUMAN BEINGS 

00:35:58.344 --> 00:36:05.142
WHICH IS A SCEPTIC.  AS A 
SOPHOMORE, I SAT IN A SKEPTICISM

00:36:05.417 --> 00:36:07.985
 CLASS.  
GRANTING OTHER PEOPLE WITH 

00:36:08.111 --> 00:36:11.882
RESPECT IN A WAY LIKE RUNNING 
INTO THE BRICK WALL THAT YOU CAN

00:36:15.354 --> 00:36:18.421
 EVER RUN INTO.  AND I THINK 
THAT'S ALL OF THESE THINGS SORT 

00:36:19.366 --> 00:36:22.737
OF ALIGNED TELL US THE WAY THAT 
SHE TEACHES, THE WAY THAT SHE 

00:36:23.066 --> 00:36:26.197
THINKS AND THE WAY SHE MODELS 
THE LIFE OF THE MIND.  THE 

00:36:26.373 --> 00:36:32.091
INTENSITY AND THE HONESTY OF IT.
AND SHE OFTEN SAYS THAT YOUR JOB

00:36:32.894 --> 00:36:38.090
 AS A FICTION WRITER IS TO WRITE
 SENTENCES THAT ARE TRUE.  WHICH

00:36:38.294 --> 00:36:42.469
 IS CONTRADICTORY BECAUSE WE 
HAVE A LOT OF ANECDOTAL THINGS 

00:36:42.470 --> 00:36:45.592
THAT THE FICTION WRITER PUTS ON 
STAGE.  I'M A FICTION WRITER AND

00:36:45.747 --> 00:36:52.643
 IN THE PAST I'M TOLD I'M A 
PATHOLOGICAL LIAR.  AND SO THEN 

00:36:53.187 --> 00:36:56.858
OVER THE YEARS, I HAD NEVER 
CONSIDERED RELIGION.  I GREW UP 

00:36:57.225 --> 00:37:00.717
INNOCENT IN RELIGION.  INNOCENT 
I WOULD SAY IN THE STRICT SENSE 

00:37:01.714 --> 00:37:04.655
OF I DID NOT GO TO CHURCH.  MY 
FAMILY WAS NEITHER

00:37:08.442 --> 00:37:13.110
 ANTAGONISTIC WITH RELIGION OR 
SYMPATHETIC WITH IT.  AND AT THE

00:37:13.111 --> 00:37:15.981
 TIME ADMIRING MARILYNNE AS MUCH
 AS I DID.  IF I WAS TO ASK HER 

00:37:15.982 --> 00:37:24.326
WHAT THE SOURCE OF HER ARTISTIC 
AND INTELLECTUAL SPHISTICATION 

00:37:24.327 --> 00:37:26.327
WAS, SHE WOULD SAY HER

00:37:29.425 --> 00:37:32.519
 RELIGION.  AND FAITH.  AND I 
ALSO WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO 

00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:36.038
HAVE SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT 
WITH HER WHEN I CORNERED HER FOR

00:37:36.481 --> 00:37:45.294
 COFFEE.  WHICH IS ANOTHER 
STORY.  BUT I READ INSTITUTES 

00:37:45.295 --> 00:37:52.267
AND CHURCH  PRAGMATICS AND WE 
STILL HAVE THESE WONDERFUL 

00:37:52.268 --> 00:38:00.388
CONVERSATIONS THAT HAVEN'T ENDED
 YET.  AND SO I THINK WE ARE ALL

00:38:01.625 --> 00:38:04.938
 ORDAINED TO FELLOWSHIP.  AND I 
THINK THAT IS ONE OF THE THINGS 

00:38:04.939 --> 00:38:10.578
THAT HAS REALLY STRUCK ME DEEPLY
 AND NEVER STOPPED RESONATING.  

00:38:10.579 --> 00:38:16.407
AND WHAT THE INTERCEPTION OF HER
 FAITH AND THE IMAGINATION.  I 

00:38:16.614 --> 00:38:18.614
DON'T KNOW THAT SHE WOULD MAKE A

00:38:22.847 --> 00:38:28.125
 DISTINCTION.  JUST IN TERMS OF 
-- I THINK SHE HAS WRITTEN ABOUT

00:38:28.258 --> 00:38:36.343
 THIS.  IN HER FAITH -- I'M JUST
 PARAPHRASING.  SHE THINKS OF 

00:38:36.344 --> 00:38:42.105
HER FAITH AS THE GREAT GIVING IN

00:38:45.915 --> 00:38:51.947
PSYCHOLOGICAL TERMS.  IT'S A 
GIFT.  SHE TAKES AN EXALTED VIEW

00:38:54.264 --> 00:38:56.264
 OF 

00:38:59.469 --> 00:39:02.418
EXPERIENCE.  SHE NEVER OPENLY 
SAID IN CLASS.  BUT SHE EMBODIES

00:39:03.128 --> 00:39:08.372
 THE VIRTUES OF THE BEST PART OF
 HER OWN FAITH AND GRACE.  AND 

00:39:09.780 --> 00:39:12.860
INSPIRES HER STUDENTS.  
SPEAKER:  THANK YOU.  THAT IS 

00:39:13.132 --> 00:39:18.215
TRUE.  I DO WANT TO SAY AS A 
SOMETIMES SCHOLAR, YOU WOULD NOT

00:39:18.430 --> 00:39:25.447
 HAVE ENJOYED A SEMINAR WITH 
JOHN.  IT WOULDN'T BE THE SAME. 

00:39:26.151 --> 00:39:30.223
SPEAKER:  MAYBE NOT.  
SHAKESPEARE.  

00:39:30.224 --> 00:39:32.224
SPEAKER:  SO, I'M REALLY STRUCK

00:39:34.180 --> 00:39:38.868
 BY WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT -- MAYBE
 YOU CAN CORRECT THIS AT SOME 

00:39:39.029 --> 00:39:44.223
POINT.  BUT MARILYNNE ROBINSON'S
 DISTINCTION BETWEEN FAITH AND 

00:39:45.350 --> 00:39:48.186
IMAGINATION.  I WANT TO HEAR 
WHAT EACH THE PANELISTS HAVE TO 

00:39:48.532 --> 00:39:51.432
SAY ABOUT THAT QUESTION.  HOW 
CLOSE IS THE RELATION BETWEEN 

00:39:51.887 --> 00:39:57.699
FAITH AND IMAGINATION?  AND HOW 
DO WE INTERVENE AND SORT SORT OF

00:39:50.341 --> 00:39:52.341
 SORT OF EXPERIENCE

00:39:55.853 --> 00:40:02.103
 THAT?  WE COULD SAY THAT ONE 
HAS AN EXTREMELY INTIMATE 

00:40:02.104 --> 00:40:05.873
ENGAGEMENT WITH THE CHARACTERS 
THAT SHE PICKS.  AND SOMETIMES 

00:40:05.874 --> 00:40:09.153
THAT LINE, YOU KNOW, BECOMES 
DIFFICULT.  AND I MENTIONED THE 

00:40:09.154 --> 00:40:11.154
MOMENT

00:40:12.545 --> 00:40:16.938
 AT THE END OF HOME WHERE 
IMAGINED DECADES OF THE FUTURE. 

00:40:17.114 --> 00:40:20.583
 WHERE GRACE WILL OCCUR.  AND 
WHO KNOWS WHAT IS ACTUALLY GOING

00:40:20.584 --> 00:40:26.327
 ON?  IT'S A GESTURE OF FAITH.  
IT'S A MOMENT OF IMAGINING.  AND

00:40:26.778 --> 00:40:29.685
 I WOULD LIKE TO START, WHOEVER 
WANTS TO START WITH INTEREST OF 

00:40:29.686 --> 00:40:32.699
TAKING THIS UP.
HOW DO YOU THINK THE DISTINCTION

00:40:33.959 --> 00:40:35.959
 AND SIMILARITIES

00:40:38.143 --> 00:40:40.969
 OVERLAP THE FAITH AND 
IMAGINATION?  

00:40:40.970 --> 00:40:43.210
SPEAKER:  I FEEL SORRY FOR 
PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE ANY KIND 

00:40:43.546 --> 00:40:46.898
OF RELIGIOUS EDUCATION.  I HAVE 
HAD TWO SEPARATE ONES.  

00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:58.337
PREFERABLY BETWEEN THREE.  I WAS
 RAISED ROMAN CATHOLIC IN A VERY

00:40:58.751 --> 00:41:00.751
 TRADITIONAL IRISH

00:41:04.398 --> 00:41:08.111
 STYLE.  
EDUCATED BY NUNS.  AND I THINK 

00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:14.092
THE GREAT GIFT OF THAT HAS 
ABSTRACT THOUGHT.  BECAUSE WHEN 

00:41:14.692 --> 00:41:18.549
YOU TELL A 7-YEAR-OLD THAT THERE
 ARE THREE PERSONS AND ONE GOD, 

00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:24.707
YOU ARE REALLY OPENING UP THE 
IDEA OF ABSTRACT.  IN A VERY 

00:41:25.188 --> 00:41:30.529
PARTICULAR WAY.  AND THE OTHER 
THING I AM GRATEFUL FOR IS THE 

00:41:30.791 --> 00:41:36.836
SENSE OF METAPHOR THAT YOU GET. 
I REMEMBER BENEDICTION AND THE 

00:41:37.084 --> 00:41:39.084
LONG LIST OF

00:41:41.648 --> 00:41:48.434
 WAYS THAT YOU CAN REALLY HAVE 
THE STAR OF THE SEEDS AND THE 

00:41:48.622 --> 00:41:51.422
ROWS.  AND I THINK THAT RELIGION
 OPENS YOU UP TO

00:41:55.631 --> 00:41:59.975
 IMAGINATION.  AND LATER ON IN 
LIFE, WHAT SOME SAY IS A MUCH 

00:42:00.269 --> 00:42:04.662
MORE HARD HEADED PIECE OF 
BUSINESS.  AND ALSO STUDIED 

00:42:04.967 --> 00:42:11.429
ISLAM VERY CLOSELY AND THE 
CORRESPONDENCE LIVING AMONG THE 

00:42:11.541 --> 00:42:16.839
WOMEN OF ISLAM WHO MADE A VERY 
DIFFERENT CHOICE TO CONVEY THE 

00:42:17.263 --> 00:42:20.568
ORTHODOX VERSION OF FAITH AND I 
FOUND VERY CONFOUNDING AND I 

00:42:20.692 --> 00:42:25.202
WANTED TO EXPLORE HOW THEY HAD 
DONE THAT.  AND I LOVED WHAT 

00:42:25.342 --> 00:42:32.013
MARILYNNE ONCE SAID.  SHE HAD AN
 ECSTATIC RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE 

00:42:32.252 --> 00:42:36.433
AND SAID IT WOULD BE WASTED BY 
ME.  BECAUSE SHE FINDS THE OLD 

00:42:36.616 --> 00:42:38.766
MARY SO LUMINOUS AND I THINK 
THAT IS WHAT A RELIGION

00:42:43.261 --> 00:42:47.418
  IMAGINATION GIVES YOU THE 
SENSE OF NOTICING.  AND THAT'S 

00:42:47.419 --> 00:42:56.976
WHAT I LIKE JEWISH PRODESTANT SO
 MUCH BECAUSE IT'S GRATEFUL FOR

00:42:57.897 --> 00:42:58.773
 NOTICING.  AND AND THE

00:42:58.774 --> 00:43:02.364
 BREAD AND THE RAIN AND YOUR 
CHILDREN.  EVERY SINGLE FRIDAY 

00:43:02.801 --> 00:43:05.499
NIGHT.  AND THAT'S A GOOD HABIT 
OF MINE TO

00:43:10.837 --> 00:43:16.900
 GET INTO I THINK.  
SPEAKER:  I THINK OF FAITH AS 

00:43:18.929 --> 00:43:22.085
BELIEF IN THE UNSEEN.  AND TO 
ME, THAT IS VERY

00:43:25.366 --> 00:43:30.394
 CLOSE TO THE IMAGINATION.  
BECAUSE THE IMAGINATION, WE ARE 

00:43:30.395 --> 00:43:38.795
CREATING THINGS IN OUR MINDS 
THAT ARE -- 

00:43:38.796 --> 00:43:47.632
THAT MAY NOT BE CONCRETE.  THAT 
MAY NOT BE VISIBLE.  AND YET, 

00:43:47.988 --> 00:43:56.616
THEY ARE IDEAS THAT MOTIVATE US,
 THAT PROVOKE US, THAT STIMULATE

00:43:56.776 --> 00:44:03.203
 US.  AND SO THAT IS THE 
CONNECTION THAT I SEE AT A 

00:44:03.568 --> 00:44:09.523
REALLY LOW LEVEL BETWEEN FAITH 
AND IMAGINATION.  

00:44:09.524 --> 00:44:14.705
SPEAKER:  YOU KNOW, I THINK THE 
ACT OF CREATING HEART AND THE 

00:44:15.313 --> 00:44:18.731
ACT OF CULTIVATING IN 
IMAGINATION WILL DISCIPLINE THE 

00:44:18.993 --> 00:44:22.190
OBSERVATION.  AND DISCIPLINE 
OBEDIENCE TO OBSERVE THINGS AS 

00:44:23.394 --> 00:44:28.052
INTENSELY AND AS CLOSELY AS 
POSSIBLE.  AND RENDER THEM OUT 

00:44:28.184 --> 00:44:32.069
OF THE PAGE WITH AESTHETIC 
PRESSURE ON THEM IN THE CASE OF 

00:44:32.274 --> 00:44:36.186
FICTION, IT'S AN ACT OF 
DEVOTION.  AND AN ACT OF 

00:44:36.372 --> 00:44:38.936
OBEDIENCE AND AN ACT OF PRAYER. 
AND WITH THAT

00:44:42.086 --> 00:44:45.750
 BEAUTIFUL KIND OF COMMERCE 
WITHIN YOUR MIND.  AND 

00:44:55.589 --> 00:44:59.949
EPISTICOLOGICAL AND YOU HAVE THE
 METAPHORS AND THEY TOPPLE AND 

00:45:00.075 --> 00:45:03.214
YOU BUILD THEM UP AGAIN.  AND 
YOU HAVE THE BOOK THAT GOES OUT 

00:45:03.511 --> 00:45:06.362
INTO THE WORLD.  AND IN WRITING 
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THE BOOK IS 

00:45:06.527 --> 00:45:08.835
GOING TO INTERACT WITH OTHER 
PEOPLE AND THEIR LIVES AND GOING

00:45:09.314 --> 00:45:14.474
 TO HAVE AGAIN, A FELLOWSHIP.  
BUT ALSO, THE ACT OF FAITH, YOU 

00:45:14.591 --> 00:45:16.591
KNOW, THESE

00:45:18.665 --> 00:45:21.673
 WORKS OF ART THAT HAVE TO BE 
MADE IN GOOD FAITH BECAUSE 

00:45:21.674 --> 00:45:24.598
THEY'RE GOING TO GO OUT AND 
AFFECT PEOPLES' LIVES.  

00:45:24.599 --> 00:45:31.239
SPEAKER:  NOW IT OCCURS TO ME IN
 WHICH ONE OF THE WAYS THAT IT 

00:45:31.968 --> 00:45:36.332
INTERPLAYS WITH MARILYNNE 
ROBINSON AND FAITH IN PARTICULAR

00:45:36.485 --> 00:45:40.200
 IS THE WAY THAT PERSONS ENGAGE 
WITH EACH OTHER AND IT'S ALMOST 

00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:42.400
LIKE YOU ENGAGE

00:45:43.731 --> 00:45:45.731
 OTHER PEOPLE THROUGH BEEN A

00:45:49.333 --> 00:45:54.177
AN AN ACT OF FAITH AND THERE WAS
 A CONNECTION OF IMMIGRATION 

00:45:54.178 --> 00:45:56.329
BETWEEN FATHER AND GRANDFATHER. 
 AND TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THIS 

00:45:56.330 --> 00:46:03.025
NEW WORLD.  AND FEEL THE WAY 
INTO THE ALIEN WORLD OF JOHN 

00:46:03.026 --> 00:46:07.891
AIMS THEOLOGY.  OR EVERYONE IS 
TRYING TO UNDERSTAND JACK.  AND 

00:46:07.892 --> 00:46:11.671
DOESN'T QUITE UNDERSTAND 
HIMSELF.  AND CAN ENGAGE HIMSELF

00:46:11.862 --> 00:46:14.389
 AND THE CONSTANT SENSE OF 
ENGAGEMENT WITH MYSTERY WHEN YOU

00:46:14.563 --> 00:46:17.863
 ARE DEALING WITH PERSONS.  IT'S
 NOT JUST THE SUPER NATURAL.  

00:46:17.864 --> 00:46:23.376
IT'S THE EVERYDAY EVENT OF HUMAN
 RELATIONS AND BECOMES AN

00:46:27.644 --> 00:46:34.208
 OCCASION FOR FAITH.  AND 
IMAGINING ENGAGEMENT WITH 

00:46:36.747 --> 00:46:43.088
OTHERS.  AND GERALDINE TALKS 
ABOUT GRAND SUBJECTS HERE.  AND 

00:46:43.483 --> 00:46:47.235
THERE IS ALSO THE ELEMENT OF 
WHIT AND HUMOR THAT YOU WANTED 

00:46:48.036 --> 00:46:49.933
TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU DIDN'T 
IGNORE.  

00:46:49.934 --> 00:46:51.934
SPEAKER:  YEAH.  
SPEAKER:  IF YOU CAN TAKE US A 

00:46:52.182 --> 00:46:54.182
LITTLE THROUGH THAT.  
SPEAKER:  SO

00:46:56.334 --> 00:47:02.121
 YEAH, I THINK EVERYBODY IS 
GRANDER AND THE ACHIEVEMENT AND 

00:47:02.122 --> 00:47:06.425
THE PENETRATION INTO WHAT 
MARILYNNE APPROVES.  

00:47:06.426 --> 00:47:11.157
BUT IT'S A VERY FUNNY BOOK.  AND
 I THINK OF SOME OF THE 

00:47:11.465 --> 00:47:13.969
CHARACTERIZATIONS IN 
HOUSEKEEPING WHERE EVERYBODY IS 

00:47:14.349 --> 00:47:24.097
STRUGGLING TO UNDERSTAND EACH 
OTHER.  AND IT'S JUST WONDERFUL 

00:47:24.990 --> 00:47:27.386
SENSE OF THE ESSENTIAL 
KNOWLEDGEABILITY OF EVEN THE 

00:47:28.049 --> 00:47:32.171
PEOPLE THAT YOU ARE CLOSEST TO 
AND YOU LOVE THE MOST, AND WHY 

00:47:32.718 --> 00:47:40.134
DID THEY DO THAT.  THINGS THAT 
JUST MADE ME SMILE AND CHUCKLE 

00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:45.055
AND GOOD WOMEN HAD A FINGER BURN
 COMING TO SEE THE CHILDREN WITH

00:47:46.044 --> 00:47:52.293
 THE BEST WILL IN THE WORLD SO 
DELICIOUS DELICIOUSLY.  AND MY 

00:47:52.294 --> 00:47:55.274
OTHER FAVORITE SCENE, THE 
CHARACTERIZATION OF AIMS' FATHER

00:47:55.595 --> 00:48:01.238
 AND GRANDFATHER WHEN THEY ARE 
VERY, VERY ANGRY WITH EACH OTHER

00:48:01.387 --> 00:48:09.692
 AND EVERY SENTENCE ENDS.  YOU 
KNOW, I THINK THAT THE WHIT IS 

00:48:09.835 --> 00:48:11.835
SOMETHING THAT SHOULD NOT BE 

00:48:13.985 --> 00:48:17.853
OVERLOOKED OR UNDER ESTIMATED.  
SPEAKER:  AND IN THE CLASSROOM? 

00:48:17.984 --> 00:48:20.677
SPEAKER:  ABSOLUTELY. 

00:48:23.751 --> 00:48:27.529
 YES.  
WICKED ISN'T THE RIGHT WORD.  

00:48:28.314 --> 00:48:33.975
BUT UNDER STATED, PROFOUND.  
YES.  YES.  [LAUGHTER].  

00:48:33.976 --> 00:48:36.062
SPEAKER:  YOU KNOW ANOTHER ONE, 
I TALKED ABOUT THE FEEL OF 

00:48:36.352 --> 00:48:39.620
GRACE.  BUT THERE IS ANOTHER 
THEME THAT SORT OF RUNS THROUGH 

00:48:40.091 --> 00:48:44.795
THESE NOVELS AND IT HAS AN 
INTEREST FOR OUTSIDERS.  AND I 

00:48:45.327 --> 00:48:51.433
THINK PAUL MENTIONED THE SOCIAL 
JUSTICE AND ESPECIALLY FIGURED 

00:48:51.611 --> 00:48:54.951
AS THE CARE WITH THE STRANGER 
AND THE ORPHAN AND SO ON.  CAN 

00:48:55.071 --> 00:48:57.828
YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE 
ELEMENT OF THE FICTION?  YOU CAN

00:48:57.945 --> 00:49:01.715
 TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT 
PERHAPS?  

00:49:01.716 --> 00:49:05.283
SPEAKER:  I THINK IT BEGINS WITH
 THE LIVES THAT SHE HAS TAKEN 

00:49:05.284 --> 00:49:08.150
THE TIME TO DEVOTE HER ATTENTION
 TO.

00:49:08.151 --> 00:49:10.579
AND AS YOU SAY THAT, 
PARTICULARLY THINKING ABOUT 

00:49:13.715 --> 00:49:16.120
LILA IN THIS CASE, WHERE SHE IS 
POOR.

00:49:16.121 --> 00:49:18.121
SHE IS AN

00:49:19.742 --> 00:49:25.665
 ORPHAN.  AND SHE IS WHEEPING IN
 THE ALIEN CORNER.  

00:49:25.666 --> 00:49:33.722
AND JUST BY THE ACT OF DEVOTING 
INSTEAD OF LAVISHING THAT 

00:49:34.658 --> 00:49:39.096
QUALITY OF ATTENTION AND THE 
REMARKS IT'S LIKE THE ACT OF 

00:49:39.270 --> 00:49:43.574
OBEDIENCE, THE ACT OF FAITH, THE
 ACT OF IMAGINATION BEING A 

00:49:44.816 --> 00:49:49.975
GESTURE OF FELLOWSHIP TOWARDS 
THE LIVES THAT WOULD NOT BE 

00:49:51.397 --> 00:49:54.824
OTHERWISE NOTED.  AND THIS KIND 
OF LAW THAT KIND OF GETS SWEPT 

00:49:55.247 --> 00:49:59.944
INTO THE CORNERS BY BECAUSE CALL
 OF THE KINGS AND THE PRINCES 

00:49:59.945 --> 00:50:01.945
AND THE

00:50:03.666 --> 00:50:09.341
 JUDGES ARE UP TO NO GOOD.  
IF ONE THING MAKES THE LORD 

00:50:09.829 --> 00:50:11.829
ANGRY, IT'S NOT TAKEN

00:50:15.523 --> 00:50:18.468
 CARE OF.  
THE HUNGRY AND THE ORPHAN.  

00:50:18.469 --> 00:50:24.152
SPEAKER:  SO IN THE TRILOLOGY, 
THERE IS AN ABSENT VERSION OF 

00:50:24.292 --> 00:50:29.416
THIS THAT HAUNTS NARRATIVES AND 
ONLY SURFACES EXPLICITLY, AND 

00:50:30.522 --> 00:50:33.003
THAT IS THE RACIAL DIVISION OF 
THE COUNTRY.  AND WHERE EVERYONE

00:50:33.153 --> 00:50:36.409
 IS SO STRONGLY FOCUSED ON OUR 
CULTURE TODAY.  AND OF COURSE IT

00:50:36.585 --> 00:50:39.680
 COMES IN AND OUT.  AND IT'S 
ALWAYS IN THE BACKGROUND.  AND 

00:50:39.801 --> 00:50:43.178
EVEN GOING BACK TO THE TENSION 
BETWEEN THE FATHER AND 

00:50:43.459 --> 00:50:47.764
GRANDFATHER.  AND THE DIVERSION 
OF QUESTION OF ELEMENTS.  I 

00:50:48.426 --> 00:50:50.904
DON'T KNOW IF ANYBODY WOULD LIKE
 TO SAY ANYTHING.  BUT YOUR 

00:50:50.905 --> 00:50:55.509
SENSE OF HOW THE RACIAL DYNAMICS
 PLAY OUT IN ALL OF THESE 

00:50:55.681 --> 00:50:57.681
WRITINGS.  
ANYONE WANT TO COMMENT ON THAT? 

00:50:58.138 --> 00:51:00.846
SPEAKER:  I THINK THAT IS 
PERHAPS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT 

00:51:01.046 --> 00:51:06.025
ACHIEVEMENT OF GILIAD.  IT'S A 
STORY ABOUT LOVE AND IT'S A VERY

00:51:06.991 --> 00:51:09.937
 INTIMATE PORTRAYAL OF LOVE.  
BUT IT HAS MANAGED TO DIGEST

00:51:13.209 --> 00:51:15.209
 THIS 

00:51:17.356 --> 00:51:19.356
ELEPHANT WHICH IS WHO ARE YOU 

00:51:22.353 --> 00:51:24.353
AND DEMAND SOMETHING OF

00:51:27.647 --> 00:51:30.100
 YOU AND SO MANY DIFFERENT 
ANSWERS TO THE QUESTION.  AND 

00:51:30.101 --> 00:51:33.498
TALK ABOUT THE SENSE OF URGENCY.
  AND THAT IS A GREAT 

00:51:33.499 --> 00:51:35.360
CHARACTERIZATION OF THE  
QUESTION THAT

00:51:35.361 --> 00:51:38.701
 THE CIVIL WAR ASKED OF 
EVERYBODY THAT WAS REQUIRED TO 

00:51:38.702 --> 00:51:43.630
LIVE THROUGH IT.  
WHO ARE YOU?  HOW DID YOU 

00:51:43.866 --> 00:51:48.763
RESPOND AND I WORKED FOR A WHILE
 NOT FAR FROM HERE IN A 

00:51:50.333 --> 00:51:55.252
QUAKERTOWN WHICH WAS SETTLED IN 
1733 BY QUAKERS AND ONE OF THE 

00:51:56.602 --> 00:51:58.602
FEW PLACES WHERE BLACKS COULD 

00:52:01.763 --> 00:52:05.755
LIVED UNHARASSED BY THE CIVIL 
WAR.  AND YOUNG MEN IN THAT TOWN

00:52:07.519 --> 00:52:11.541
 FACED THE GREATER CHOICE.  
VIOLENCE OR SLAVERY.  AND SOME 

00:52:12.083 --> 00:52:16.466
OF THE YOUNG MEN IN THAT TOWN 
MADE THE CHOICE TO TAKE UP ARMS 

00:52:17.645 --> 00:52:20.784
AND FIGHT AGAINST SLAVERY.  AND 
THAT MEANT THEY WERE OUT OF 

00:52:26.601 --> 00:52:30.977
MEETING AND HAD A TOWN.  AND I 
THINK THE CHOICES THAT WE MAKE 

00:52:31.425 --> 00:52:37.841
AS INDIVIDUALS ARE REALLY NARROW
 AND IF SO, EXQUISITELY GIFTED 

00:52:38.445 --> 00:52:41.912
AND EXPLAINED WHO MAKES WHAT 
CHOICE AND WHAT ARE THE 

00:52:42.270 --> 00:52:44.270
RAMIFICATIONS OF IT.  
SPEAKER:  SO

00:52:48.036 --> 00:52:52.383
 SOMEBODY MENTIONED EARLY THE 
LUMINOUS CHARACTER OF THE 

00:52:52.384 --> 00:52:56.357
ORDINARY COMING THROUGH THE 
TEACHING AND COMING THROUGH THE 

00:52:56.519 --> 00:53:01.167
FICTION.  WE DON'T TALK MUCH 
ABOUT THE WATER PERVASIVE ROLE 

00:53:01.872 --> 00:53:06.117
OF WHETHER SEASONAL CHANGE OR 
THE INTERFAITH CERTAINLY, YOU 

00:53:06.238 --> 00:53:10.985
KNOW, THINGS HAPPENING ON THE 
EDGE OF TOWN IN A REAL SETTING. 

00:53:11.669 --> 00:53:14.143
AND THEN THE WAY THAT CHARACTERS
 MOVE THROUGH THAT LAST PART AND

00:53:14.344 --> 00:53:18.140
 SO ON.  WHAT HAPPENS WITH THEIR
 ENGAGEMENT IN NATURE.  AND I 

00:53:18.392 --> 00:53:19.134
THINK YOU HAD AN INTERESTING 
SEGUE ABOUT NATURE.  AND TALKED 

00:53:19.135 --> 00:53:21.135
 ABOUT INTEREST

00:53:22.274 --> 00:53:29.019
 IN NATURE AS THE SHINING ARMOUR
 IN WHICH GOD HAS REVEALED AND 

00:53:29.020 --> 00:53:32.840
CONCEALED AND IT'S A SLIGHTLY 
DIFFERENT ANGLE I THINK.  AND 

00:53:32.841 --> 00:53:37.255
TALKS ABOUT THE ROLE OF THE 
NATURAL WORLD.  AND NOT AS A 

00:53:37.256 --> 00:53:40.125
PHYSICAL UNIVERSE.  AND 
SPECIFICALLY THE LANDSCAPE, 

00:53:40.239 --> 00:53:45.463
CLIMBING, THE WEATHER, SEASONAL 
CHANGE.  

00:53:45.464 --> 00:53:50.352
SPEAKER:  I THINK THEIR 
DESCRIPTION OF THE WAY IN 

00:53:50.504 --> 00:53:54.768
HOUSEKEEPING, THE WAKE IS ALMOST
 AS IMPORTANT IN CHARACTER AS 

00:53:54.882 --> 00:53:59.710
EVERY HUMAN BEING.  SO THEY HAVE
 A VOICE.  AND THE LAKE HAS A 

00:54:00.177 --> 00:54:02.965
PRESENCE.  AND THE LAKE WILL 
COME AND INFILTRATE YOUR LIFE 

00:54:03.145 --> 00:54:07.538
AND CHANGE HOW YOU CAN LIVE.  
AND I THINK THAT MODESTY IN THE 

00:54:07.882 --> 00:54:14.928
FACE OF NATURE IS SOMETHING THAT
 WE ALL NEED TO BE A LITTLE BIT 

00:54:15.584 --> 00:54:19.265
MORE READY TO CONCEDE.  
SPEAKER:  I THINK OF IT IN TERMS

00:54:20.454 --> 00:54:29.213
 -- I THINK OF IT IN TERMS OF 
PARTIALLY ANYWAY, THE SORT OF 

00:54:31.037 --> 00:54:38.261
THE POSITION, STEVENS AS WELL 
AND EMILY DICKONSON AND THE LINE

00:54:39.316 --> 00:54:42.530
 IN HOUSEKEEPING THAT I ALWAYS 
THINK OF.  IN THE BOTTOM OF THE 

00:54:43.245 --> 00:54:46.462
BOAT GOING ACROSS THE LAKE.  AND
 SHE IS VERY TIRED AND CLOSES 

00:54:46.463 --> 00:54:52.358
HER EYES AND ALLOWS HER MIND TO 
BECOME CO-EXTENSIVE WITH THE 

00:54:52.787 --> 00:54:57.234
DARKNESS.  AND I THINK WHEN I 
READ LANDSCAPE, I READ IT AS A 

00:54:58.335 --> 00:55:02.911
PROJECTION OF CHARACTER.  IT'S 
CO-EXTENSIVE WITH CHARACTER.  

00:55:03.957 --> 00:55:07.570
IT'S AN EXPERIENTIAL.  AND 
LANDSCAPE DOES NOT EXIST 

00:55:07.954 --> 00:55:13.314
INDEPENDENTLY OF THE PERCEPTION 
OF THE EXPERIENCE OF IT.  SO 

00:55:13.664 --> 00:55:16.128
IT'S A REFRACTIVE KIND OF 
QUALITY TO IT.  

00:55:16.129 --> 00:55:21.497
SPEAKER:  SO THE OBJECTIVE 
LANDSCAPE IS BEING REFRACTED 

00:55:21.684 --> 00:55:25.943
THROUGH AN EXPERIENCED SUBJECT. 
AND IT BECOMES A BEAUTIFUL 

00:55:26.125 --> 00:55:28.452
LUMINOUS WAY OF RENDERING 
CHARACTER.  

00:55:31.551 --> 00:55:35.944
SPEAKER:  AND ALSO I THINK 
ANOTHER REALLY ENDURABLE MOMENT 

00:55:36.762 --> 00:55:38.762
FOR ME IS THE DESCRIPTION OF

00:55:42.136 --> 00:55:51.837
 ANG AND HIS FATHER AT THE GRAVE

00:55:52.360 --> 00:55:55.892
SITE.  IT'S AN UGLY PIECE OF 
LAND.  BUT THEN THEY STEP AWAY 

00:55:56.047 --> 00:55:58.168
AND IT BECOMES BEAUTIFUL.  WHICH
 I AM AWAKE.  

00:55:58.169 --> 00:56:02.961
SPEAKER:  SETTING THE MEANS AND 
ARRIVING AND CREATING SCHEMES OF

00:56:03.345 --> 00:56:05.159
 LIGHT.  
SPEAKER:  THAT WAS AN AMAZING 

00:56:05.160 --> 00:56:08.630
MOMENT.  YOU AS A SCIENTIST, HOW
 DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE WORLD 

00:56:09.817 --> 00:56:11.570
WITH LANDSCAPING?  
SPEAKER:  I THINK OUR 

00:56:11.571 --> 00:56:17.006
RELATIONSHIP TO NATURE IS 
EXTREMELY INTERESTING. 

00:56:21.177 --> 00:56:23.177
 AND

00:56:24.614 --> 00:56:31.534
 COMPLICATED.  AND I THINK THAT 
THERE IS ONE METAPHOR OF NATURE,

00:56:32.188 --> 00:56:33.463
 MOTHER NATURE,NATURE, THAT

00:56:33.464 --> 00:56:37.801
 NATURE IS GOING TO TAKE CARE OF
 US,

00:56:41.281 --> 00:56:43.387
 MATERNAL FEELING, THAT NATURE 
COMFORTS US.  AND THEN ON THE  

00:56:43.388 --> 00:56:45.388
ON THE OTHER HAND,

00:56:48.151 --> 00:56:50.151
 WE HAVE EARTHQUAKES THAT KILL

00:56:54.251 --> 00:56:58.721
 THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE.  
AND NATURAL DISASTERS.  I ALWAYS

00:56:58.842 --> 00:57:03.643
 REMEMBER BEING OUT ON THE OCEAN
 IN A SMALL BOAT THE FIRST TIME 

00:57:04.336 --> 00:57:09.983
BY MYSELF WITH MY WIFE.  AND 
LOOKING AROUND AND SEEING 

00:57:10.212 --> 00:57:18.750
NOTHING BUT WATER IN EVERY 
DIRECTION.  NO LAND IN SIGHT.  

00:57:18.894 --> 00:57:26.797
AND I FELT LIKE I WAS IN A VAST 
PLACE THAT DIDN'T CARE ABOUT ME 

00:57:28.267 --> 00:57:34.251
AT ALL.  AND THERE WAS NO SENSE 
OF SUBCONSCIOUSNESS 

00:57:38.202 --> 00:57:41.426
THERE.  AND I THINK THESE ARE --
 THERE IS A TENSION BETWEEN THE 

00:57:41.427 --> 00:57:44.735
TWO DIFFERENT VIEWS OF WHAT 
NATURE IS AND OUR RELATIONSHIP 

00:57:44.736 --> 00:57:49.489
TO NATURE WHICH CAN BE FOUND IN 
OUR LITERATURE AND OUR HISTORY. 

00:57:49.615 --> 00:57:52.334
 AND ANTHROPOLOGY AND EVERYTHING
 ELSE.  

00:57:52.335 --> 00:57:54.723
SPEAKER:  BUT AT LEAST YOU WERE 
THERE TO NOTICE THAT NOBODY 

00:57:54.859 --> 00:57:56.859
NOTICED YOU.  

00:58:03.511 --> 00:58:05.203
[LAUGHTER].  
SPEAKER:  ALSO YOU MAY HAVE 

00:58:05.204 --> 00:58:07.838
NOTICED THAT WE HAVE AN EMPTY 
CHAIR ON STAGE HERE.  IT'S 

00:58:07.986 --> 00:58:10.612
ACTUALLY NOT FOR ALIJAH WHICH IS
 WHAT YOU MAY HAVE

00:58:14.368 --> 00:58:20.566
 BEEN THINKING.
SO I WOULD BE HONORED AND I 

00:58:20.955 --> 00:58:22.955
THINK WE ALL WOULD BE IF  
MARILYNNE ROBINSON JOINED

00:58:23.638 --> 00:58:26.902
 US ON STAGE FOR A FEW MOMENTS. 

00:58:35.559 --> 00:58:37.559
[APPLAUSE]. 

00:58:56.973 --> 00:59:04.751
 SO SO I THINK THAT THE IDEA NOW
 IS THAT WE WOULD LIKE YOU TO 

00:58:53.328 --> 00:58:57.180
REACT A LITTLE BIT TO WHAT YOU 
HAVE HEARD.  OR ADD WHATEVER YOU

00:58:57.181 --> 00:58:59.283
 WOULD LIKE TO ADD. 
AND TAKE US WHATEVER DIRECTION 

00:58:59.465 --> 00:59:02.728
YOU WANT TO TAKE US.  
SPEAKER:  I -- WELL, FIRST OF 

00:59:02.917 --> 00:59:04.917
ALL, I HAVE TO SAY THIS IS THE

00:59:11.347 --> 00:59:19.558
 MOST SELF-INDULGENT DAY I HAVE 
EVER HAD.  THIS IS BETTER THAN 

00:59:19.794 --> 00:59:22.700
MOST.  WHERE YOU WERE GOING, IT 
WAS FASCINATING.  AND I COULDN'T

00:59:24.416 --> 00:59:33.909
 BE MORE PLEASED.  AND I THINK 
THAT YOU SAID SOMETHING VERY

00:59:38.351 --> 00:59:46.346
 DESCRIPDESCRIPTIVE AND I AM IN 
MY OWN THOUGHT AND LOOK THROUGH 

00:59:46.347 --> 00:59:54.208
IT LIKE A PRISON LENS, AND YOU 
KNOW, I HAVE BECOME SORT OF 

00:59:54.209 --> 00:59:57.862
DEEPLY IMMERSED IN THEOLOGY THAT
 I BASICALLY INHERITED, ALTHOUGH

00:59:58.012 --> 01:00:03.173
 I WAS UNAWARE OF IT, A LITTLE 
PRESBYTERIAN KNOWING NOTHING 

01:00:03.406 --> 01:00:06.490
ABOUT WHAT I WAS BEING TAUGHT.  
AND THEN AGAIN I REALIZED THAT 

01:00:06.591 --> 01:00:13.117
IT WAS A SERIES OF THEOLOGY, IT 
WAS AVAILABLE TO ME.  AND THAT I

01:00:14.985 --> 01:00:21.601
 FELT AS IF, YOU KNOW, IF YOU 
GRANTED IT TERMS, YOU CAN FEEL 

01:00:21.738 --> 01:00:25.319
THINGS.  AND THEOLOGY HAS OTHER 
THINGS.  AND THIS IS THE ONE 

01:00:25.692 --> 01:00:34.192
THAT I FIND MYSELF ENGROSSED BY.
AND A CERTAIN EMPHASIS AND ONE 

01:00:34.335 --> 01:00:39.931
OF THEM IS THE IDEA IN WHICH YOU
 FIND VERY MUCH IN WRITING.  

01:00:40.191 --> 01:00:46.719
ESPECIALLY THE EARLIER ONES THAT
 THE BEAUTY IS GOD.  AND

01:00:50.343 --> 01:00:52.939
 THAT IT'S AN QUESTION OF 
CONSCIOUSNESS ON WHETHER OR NOT 

01:00:53.206 --> 01:00:55.206
YOU PERCEIVE THE BEAUTIFUL.  AND
 AND THE

01:00:55.605 --> 01:00:58.488
 ASSUMPTION IS THAT IT'S ALWAYS 
SO ONE WAY OR ANOTHER TO 

01:01:03.539 --> 01:01:09.189
BE PERCEIVED.  AND SO, THE 
BUILDING OF CREATION IS IMPLICIT

01:01:09.540 --> 01:01:11.540
 PEOPLE AND PEOPLE HAVE TO LEARN
 HOW TO

01:01:16.721 --> 01:01:21.215
 SEE IN ORDER TO FEEL.  
AND THE FURTHER YOU GO, THE 

01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:29.496
RICHNESS BECOMES APPARENT TOO.  
AND A MOMENT OF INTERACTION 

01:01:29.497 --> 01:01:30.519
BETWEEN TWO TWO 

01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:34.749
PEOPLE, WHAT PASSES BETWEEN THEM
 THAT COULD BE CALLED BEAUTIFUL,

01:01:34.879 --> 01:01:39.910
 YOU KNOW?  AND ANOTHER THING 
THAT I LIKE VERY MUCH ABOUT IT 

01:01:39.911 --> 01:01:47.564
IS THE HUMANISM OF IT.  THE 
ASSUMPTION THAT EVERY ENCOUNTER 

01:01:47.565 --> 01:01:52.270
BETWEEN TWO PEOPLE, ONE'S SELF 
AND ANOTHER, IS THE QUESTION 

01:01:52.271 --> 01:01:55.441
BEING POSED BY GOD.  
AND YOUR QUESTION IS, WHAT DOES 

01:01:55.780 --> 01:02:02.211
GOD WANT FROM THIS INTERACTION. 
AND THE WAY IT'S ARTICULATED AS 

01:02:02.385 --> 01:02:09.549
AN IDEA, THE OTHER IMAGE OF GOD 
VIRTUALLY IS GOD AND ALL 

01:02:09.720 --> 01:02:11.720
INTERACTIONS HAVE 

01:02:15.320 --> 01:02:18.896
THEOLOGICAL WAYS.  THE OTHER IS 
GOD.  THE OTHER IS CHRIST.  FROM

01:02:19.166 --> 01:02:22.719
 THE POINT OF VIEW OF MAKING 
INQUIRIES OF YOUR EXPERIENCE 

01:02:22.720 --> 01:02:24.720
INTO A HUMAN BEING,

01:02:27.409 --> 01:02:33.218
 THERE IS ALMOST NO MORE 
RADICALLY ILLUMINATING QUESTION 

01:02:33.353 --> 01:02:38.586
THAN WHAT WOULD GOD WANT FROM 
THE SITUATION?  BECAUSE AS IT'S 

01:02:38.925 --> 01:02:42.725
ARTICULATED, GOD EITHER IS THE 
OTHER PERSON OR IS VERY DEEPLY 

01:02:42.902 --> 01:02:51.009
SYMPATHETIC WITH THE OTHER 
PERSON, YOU KNOW, AND IT'S KIND 

01:02:51.135 --> 01:02:55.564
OF AN AESTHETIC, ETHICAL 
AESTHETIC THAT IS VERY MOVING TO

01:02:56.099 --> 01:02:59.382
 ME AND THAT, YOU KNOW, THESE 
ARE PROBABLY THE TWO ASSUMPTIONS

01:03:00.998 --> 01:03:04.722
 THAT COME OUT OF MY OWN 
RELIGIOUS BACKGROUND OR THEOLOGY

01:03:05.060 --> 01:03:08.148
 THAT I FIND TO BE MOST USEFUL 
TO ME AS A NOVELIST.  

01:03:08.149 --> 01:03:13.038
SPEAKER:  VERY GOOD.  VERY GOOD.
SO ALTHOUGH ELEMENTS OF WHAT YOU

01:03:13.534 --> 01:03:15.984
 HEARD FROM THE PANEL UP HERE 
ANYTHING THAT YOU WANT TO PUSH 

01:03:16.405 --> 01:03:20.305
BACK ON IN ANY WAY?  [LAUGHTER].
SPEAKER: 

01:03:27.794 --> 01:03:31.336
 IT'S GOOD TO KNOW.  
SPEAKER:  IT COMES DOWN TO WHAT 

01:03:31.477 --> 01:03:38.330
YOU CALL REAL.  IF YOU LOOK AT 
SOMETHING WITH AN INTENSE VALUE 

01:03:39.775 --> 01:03:42.826
INCLUDING THE REALITY OF 
PLAYING, BEAUTY IS THE THING 

01:03:46.088 --> 01:03:48.088
THAT EXISTS ALSO.  AND THEY HAVE

01:03:51.422 --> 01:03:57.791
 THE LEVEL OF UNDERSTANDING THAT
 COMPLICATES THE IDEA THAT 

01:03:58.701 --> 01:04:00.701
CHANGES IN AN

01:04:02.484 --> 01:04:06.646
 INCREDIBLY RICH WAY.  
SPEAKER:  SO I AGREE

01:04:09.883 --> 01:04:11.883
 THAT NATURE IS BEAUTIFUL.  BUT 
YOU

01:04:16.429 --> 01:04:20.391
 MENTIONED REALITY.  AND 
SCIENTISTS DON'T REALLY KNOW 

01:04:20.392 --> 01:04:22.395
WHAT REALITY IS.  
SPEAKER:  I KNOW.  

01:04:31.170 --> 01:04:32.554
[LAUGHTER].  
THERE ARE BEAUTIFUL THINGS ABOUT

01:04:32.555 --> 01:04:36.734
 IT.  
SPEAKER:  THERE ARE

01:04:30.042 --> 01:04:32.042
SPEAKER:  THERE ARE BEAUTIFUL

01:04:33.423 --> 01:04:36.293
 THINGS ABOUT IT.  I THINK 
PHILOSOPHERS, IF ANYBODY KNOWS 

01:04:36.738 --> 01:04:39.594
WHAT REALITY IS, IT MIGHT BE 
PHILOSOPHERS.  SCIENTISTS REALLY

01:04:39.725 --> 01:04:44.478
 DON'T CLAIM TO KNOW WHAT 
REALITY IS.  SCIENTISTS -- WHAT 

01:04:44.479 --> 01:04:46.988
WE KNOW AS SCIENTISTS

01:04:50.935 --> 01:04:57.236
 IS THE READINGS OF METERS AND 
WHAT SCIENCE IS ABOUT FOR US IS 

01:04:57.237 --> 01:05:00.039
THE ABILITY TO PREDICT WHERE 
THAT NEEDLE IS GOING TO GO WHEN 

01:05:00.040 --> 01:05:04.784
YOU HOOK IT UP TO A CERTAIN 
ELECTRICAL CIRCUIT.  

01:05:04.785 --> 01:05:07.336
SPEAKER:  I THINK YOU'RE TOO 
MODEST.  

01:05:07.337 --> 01:05:09.337
SPEAKER:  WELL, WE HAVE

01:05:11.698 --> 01:05:14.909
 THEORIES.  BEAUTIFUL THEORIES. 

01:05:14.910 --> 01:05:17.234
MATHEMATICALLY BEAUTIFUL 
THEORIES THAT TRY TO PREDICT 

01:05:17.406 --> 01:05:21.484
WHERE THAT NEEDLE IS GOING TO 
GO.  AND THOSE THEORIES HAVE 

01:05:23.134 --> 01:05:26.100
INTERNAL BEAUTIES.  BUT 
ULTIMATELY, WE'RE NOT SAYING 

01:05:26.253 --> 01:05:33.453
ANYTHING ABOUT REALITY.  
REALITY, TO ME, IS A VERY 

01:05:33.896 --> 01:05:36.673
ABSTRACT CONCEPTION THAT ALL WE 
REALLY KNOW IS OUR EXPERIENCE

01:05:39.769 --> 01:05:42.793
 WITH THE WORLD.  
SPEAKER:  YOU KNOW, I MEAN I 

01:05:43.563 --> 01:05:47.653
AGREE THAT REALITY IS VERY 

01:05:51.591 --> 01:05:58.902
ELUSIVE AND APPEARS TO BE ON THE
 SCALE.  YOU KNOW, BUT IF THAT 

01:05:58.903 --> 01:06:03.689
IS TRUE, THEN IF YOU SHOW A 
THEORY TO ANOTHER SCIENTIST, AND

01:06:03.956 --> 01:06:06.024
 HE SAYS THAT IS NOT ELEGANT, HE
 HAS MADE A STATEMENT THAT THAT 

01:06:06.025 --> 01:06:08.025
HAS

01:06:09.428 --> 01:06:17.163
 SOMETHING TO DO WITH REALITY, 
RIGHT?  BEAUTIFUL, THAT HAS 

01:06:17.299 --> 01:06:22.646
SOMETHING TO DO WITH REALITY.  
SPEAKER:  NO, I'M NOT, I'M 

01:06:23.382 --> 01:06:26.449
TOTALLY IN AGREEMENT WITH YOU 
THAT SCIENTIFIC THEORIES CAN BE 

01:06:26.576 --> 01:06:30.097
BEAUTIFUL. AS WELL AS THE 
OBJECTS THEY DESCRIBE.  BUT WHAT

01:06:30.241 --> 01:06:36.194
 SCIENCE HAS FOUND REMARKABLY IS
 THAT THE THEORIES THAT WE HUMAN

01:06:38.303 --> 01:06:42.174
 BEINGS DEEM ELEGANT, HAPPENED 
TO BE THE ONES THAT AGREE MOST 

01:06:42.358 --> 01:06:46.033
CLOSELY WITH WHERE THAT NEEDLE 
IS GOING TO POINT ON THE VOTE 

01:06:46.166 --> 01:06:48.974
METER.  AND THEN A SCIENTIST 

01:06:55.336 --> 01:07:01.262
SAYS TO ANOTHER SCIENTIST, THAT 
THEORY IS NOT ELEGANT.  I DON'T 

01:07:01.439 --> 01:07:04.914
THINK THAT SHE MEANS THAT THE 
THEORY DOESN'T CORRESPOND TO 

01:07:05.609 --> 01:07:10.003
REALITY.  BUT I THINK THAT THE 
THEORY IS NOT GOING TO AGREE 

01:07:10.721 --> 01:07:16.333
WITH EXPERIMENT.  BECAUSE WE 
HAVE FOUND THAT ELEGANCE IN OUR 

01:07:16.651 --> 01:07:18.624
AESTHETIC JUDGMENTS SEEM TO 
ACCORD WITH THE BEHAVIOR OF 

01:07:18.625 --> 01:07:23.127
NATURE.  WHICH IS A MIRACLE IN 
ITSELF.  

01:07:26.315 --> 01:07:30.952
SPEAKER:  I LOVE YOUR LANGUAGE. 
[LAUGHTER].  BUT IF YOU CAN'T 

01:07:31.085 --> 01:07:35.928
USE THE WORD BEAUTY, AND 
MUTUALLY INTELLIGENT AND YOU 

01:07:36.162 --> 01:07:41.967
HAVE THE PREDICTIVE POWER IN 
TERMS OF WHAT YOU WANT TO THINK,

01:07:43.390 --> 01:07:47.467
 THEN IT EXISTS.  
SPEAKER:  I CERTAINLY 

01:07:52.157 --> 01:07:55.882
AGREE.  
[LAUGHTER].  WELL, IT EXISTS IN 

01:07:56.245 --> 01:07:58.245
THE SENSE THAT

01:07:59.608 --> 01:08:04.057
 VARIOUS PEOPLE CAN LOOK AT THE 
PAINTING, LET'S SAY THE MONA 

01:08:04.749 --> 01:08:06.749
LISA OR SOME OTHER PAINTING THAT
 WE KNOW, 

01:08:11.137 --> 01:08:15.516
PICASSO, MINOT, AND FEEL THAT 
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.  OR YOU READ ONE

01:08:15.699 --> 01:08:23.436
 OF YOUR NOVELS AND YOU GET A 
CONSENSUS THAT IT'S BEAUTIFUL.  

01:08:23.437 --> 01:08:27.278
WHETHER OR NOT THAT MEANS THE 
BEAUTY EXISTS AS AN ABSTRACT 

01:08:27.464 --> 01:08:31.919
CONCEPT OUT THERE IN THE 
UNIVERSE, THAT IS SOMETHING THAT

01:08:32.927 --> 01:08:36.649
 I DON'T KNOW.  BUT CERTAINLY IF
 A LOT OF DIFFERENT PEOPLE CAN 

01:08:37.071 --> 01:08:39.071
AGREE THAT A

01:08:40.081 --> 01:08:44.956
 PARTICULAR THING IS BEAUTIFUL. 
 IT'S A DISCIPLINED THOUGHT, FOR

01:08:44.957 --> 01:08:48.092
 EXAMPLE, THAT THEORY WON'T 
WORK, IT IS NOT BEAUTIFUL.

01:08:48.093 --> 01:08:54.482
I MEAN, THAT'S NOT JUST AN 
AESTHETIC STATEMENT.  IT'S A 

01:08:54.695 --> 01:08:55.906
PREDICTION.  
SPEAKER:  IT IS.  AGAIN, I THINK

01:08:55.907 --> 01:09:04.556
 IT GOES BACK TO THE REMARKABLE 
FACT THAT OUR AESTHETIC SENSE, 

01:09:04.684 --> 01:09:08.075
WHICH IS WHAT WE CONSIDER 
BEAUTIFUL, SEEMS TO ACCORD WITH 

01:09:08.307 --> 01:09:12.958
THE WORTH OF NATURE.  BY AND 
LARGE, THE THEORIES THAT WE HAVE

01:09:13.274 --> 01:09:16.764
 THOUGHT WERE BEAUTIFUL TURNED 
OUT TO BE THE RIGHT ONES.  AND 

01:09:16.955 --> 01:09:19.753
WHEN I SAY RIGHT, IN A SENSE 
THAT THEY ARE ABLE TO PREDICT 

01:09:19.880 --> 01:09:23.203
WHERE THE NEEDLE GOES ON THE 
BOAT METER.  

01:09:23.204 --> 01:09:25.502
SPEAKER:  APART FROM THE 
QUESTION OF PREDICTABILITY AND 

01:09:25.626 --> 01:09:28.816
SO ON.  THERE IS ANOTHER WAY IN 
WHICH THE PHILOSOPHER OF SCIENCE

01:09:29.060 --> 01:09:33.094
 TALKS ABOUT THE CONVERSATION 
THAT WE ARE HAVING CALLED EMERGE

01:09:38.931 --> 01:09:43.221
EMERGENT REALITY AND FROM THE 
PHENOMENON THAT THEY OCCUR IN 

01:09:43.415 --> 01:09:47.264
THE NATIONAL WORLD, THERE ARE 
WISE THINGS LIKE BEAUTY AND WISE

01:09:48.129 --> 01:09:50.553
 THINGS LIKE CONSCIOUSNESS AND 
MIND.  WHICH ON SOME ACCOUNTS 

01:09:50.679 --> 01:09:55.194
ARE ELUCERY AND THAT IS A 
CERTAIN VERSION OF THEORY AS IT 

01:09:55.315 --> 01:10:00.523
PLAYS ITSELF OUT IN PHILOSOPHY 
DEBATES ABOUT SCIENCE.  AND 

01:10:00.908 --> 01:10:06.555
ANOTHER THOUGHT IS REALITY.  
THEY EMERGE FROM THE ACTUALITIES

01:10:07.270 --> 01:10:15.361
 OF PHYSICAL PROCESSES.  ARE YOU
 EMERGENT BY ANY CHANCE OR 

01:10:18.704 --> 01:10:20.704
ANTIEM

01:10:23.553 --> 01:10:26.713
 ANTIEMEANTIEMERGENT?  
SPEAKER:  NO, I AGREE WITH THAT,

01:10:26.856 --> 01:10:28.856
 I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE 
PROPERTIES OF NATURE THAT CANNOT

01:10:29.139 --> 01:10:31.826
 BE PUT WITH ALL OF THE PIECES. 

01:10:31.827 --> 01:10:34.465
BUT WHEN YOU PUT EVERYTHING 
TOGETHER, YOU GET SOMETHING THAT

01:10:35.227 --> 01:10:39.155
 IS QUALITATIVELY DIFFERENT AND 
NOT JUST QUANTITATIVELY.  

01:10:39.156 --> 01:10:41.162
SPEAKER:  AND WHAT ABOUT YOU 
WITH THE BEAUTY OF THE 

01:10:47.788 --> 01:10:49.788
EMERGENT PROPERTIES?  

01:10:53.223 --> 01:10:55.223
[LAUGHTER]. 

01:10:58.290 --> 01:11:02.448
 SO I WANT TO SAY AT THIS POINT,
 WE ACTUALLY HAVE MICROPHONES 

01:11:02.449 --> 01:11:07.883
MICROPHONES SET UP AND IN THE 
INTEREST, WE WOULD LIKE TO FIND 

01:11:07.884 --> 01:11:12.380
OUT FOR THOSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO 
ASK QUESTIONS OF MS. ROBINSON OR

01:11:12.504 --> 01:11:17.095
 THE PANEL, IF YOU CAN LINE UP 
BETWEEN THE TWO MICS HERE AND WE

01:11:17.247 --> 01:11:22.927
 WILL GO BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN 
THE TWO AISLES.  MAKE A COMMENT 

01:11:22.928 --> 01:11:27.321
OR QUESTION.  WE ARE SORT OF A 
THIRD OF THE WAY UP THE AISLE.  

01:11:27.514 --> 01:11:31.616
AND WE WILL GET TO AS MANY AS WE
 CAN IN THE NEXT 20 MINUTES OR 

01:11:31.861 --> 01:11:33.861
SO.  IT WOULD

01:11:37.689 --> 01:11:41.825
 BE INTERESTING DOING THAT.  IF 
ANYONE WANTS TO COME DOWN.  A 

01:11:41.826 --> 01:11:43.826
COUPLE OF PEOPLE 

01:11:46.034 --> 01:11:50.415
WE HAVE APPROACHING.  I WILL 
START OVER HERE.  STAGE RIGHT.  

01:11:50.689 --> 01:11:55.423
SPEAKER:  HELLO.  THIS IS LOUD. 
HI, I REALLY HAVE BEEN ENJOYING 

01:11:59.309 --> 01:12:04.579
THIS CONVERSATION.  THANK YOU SO
 MUCH.  I WANT TO GO BACK TO 

01:12:05.518 --> 01:12:13.238
SOMETHING THAT PAUL SAID, ABOUT 
A TEACHER, MS. ROBINSON, THE 

01:12:13.376 --> 01:12:17.468
VIRTUE NATURE AND BELIEF.  AND I
 WANT TO CONNECT THAT TO THE 

01:12:17.586 --> 01:12:20.659
NATURE OF BEAUTY.  DO YOU FEEL 
THAT EXPERIENCING BEAUTIFUL 

01:12:22.014 --> 01:12:24.014
OBJECTS, THINGS, MAKES

01:12:26.980 --> 01:12:32.161
 US BETTER PEOPLE?  
SPEAKER:  I THINK THAT WE ARE 

01:12:32.505 --> 01:12:36.884
MADE BETTER BY BEING ATTENTIVE 
TO BEAUTIES IN FORMS THAT ARE 

01:12:36.998 --> 01:12:41.488
NOT YET THOUGHT AS BEAUTIFUL.  I
 THINK IT'S MUCH MORE A HABIT OF

01:12:41.770 --> 01:12:46.948
 MIND THAT IS CALLED FOR 
DISCIPLINING ONE'S ATTENTION 

01:12:47.244 --> 01:12:52.471
WHAT HAS ALREADY BEEN CALLED 
BEAUTIFUL.  

01:12:52.472 --> 01:12:54.623
SPEAKER:  RIGHT THERE.  
SPEAKER:  IN

01:12:57.644 --> 01:13:02.524
 TERMS OF THE RELATIONSHIP 
BETWEEN THE SPIRITUAL AND 

01:13:02.731 --> 01:13:08.170
WRITING.  WHEN I WAS IN HIGH 
SCHOOL, ONE OF MY PAPERS WAS 

01:13:08.171 --> 01:13:10.171
ABOUT ROBERT GRAVES. 
AND THE WHITE

01:13:13.204 --> 01:13:20.087
 GODDESS, THIS WHOLE CONCEPT 
THAT ARTISTS ARE NEARLY CONDUIT 

01:13:20.088 --> 01:13:23.744
AND SPIRITUAL.  
AND THAT EITHER WE WORK AT IT OR

01:13:24.018 --> 01:13:29.255
 WE ARE CHOSEN.  HOW MUCH DO YOU
 FEEL THAT YOUR -- THAT YOU 

01:13:29.386 --> 01:13:31.386
KNOW, SORT OF THE

01:13:33.650 --> 01:13:39.550
 SPIRITUALITY IN THIS, YOU KNOW,
 WHEN I WOULD WRITE MUSIC.  YOU 

01:13:39.551 --> 01:13:44.338
USED TO BE A DRUMMER IN A BAND 
AND SO ON, THINGS HAPPEN THAT 

01:13:44.339 --> 01:13:47.712
YOU DON'T PLAN AHEAD.  AND THEY 
COME COME OUT IN THE STORY.  AND

01:13:47.881 --> 01:13:50.380
 IT SORT OF TAKES ON A PIECE OF 
ITS OWN.  

01:13:50.381 --> 01:13:54.284
AND YOU LOSE YOURSELF.  YOU 
KNOW, YOU DON'T START OFF WITH 

01:13:54.417 --> 01:13:59.043
THIS IS WHAT I AM GOING TO SAY. 
BUT YOU LOSE YOURSELF IN THAT.  

01:13:59.466 --> 01:14:04.026
AND HOW MUCH DOES THAT HAPPEN IN
 TERMS OF YOUR VIEW OF THE ART 

01:14:04.027 --> 01:14:07.109
OF WRITING THAT YOU ARE DEALING 
WITH?  

01:14:07.110 --> 01:14:11.888
SPEAKER:  WELL, IT HAPPENS A 
LOT.  YOU KNOW, I DON'T TRUST 

01:14:12.458 --> 01:14:14.458
WHAT I AM WRITING UNLESS IT

01:14:18.519 --> 01:14:26.082
 SURPRISES ME, YOU KNOW.  WHAT 
IS REALLY AMAZING TO ME, I HAVE 

01:14:26.227 --> 01:14:28.532
WRITTEN TWO BOOKS AT THE 
MINIMUM, THAT I CONSIDERED

01:14:31.590 --> 01:14:35.935
 DEEPLY PERSONAL.  DEEPLY 
PRESENT.  I DIDN'T REALLY, UNTIL

01:14:36.053 --> 01:14:42.542
 I GOT A HOLD OF THE AGENT, I 
DIDN'T THINK THAT I WOULD 

01:14:42.667 --> 01:14:48.256
PUBLISH, I JUST, YOU KNOW, WHEN 
YOU SEE THESE THINGS THAT HAPPEN

01:14:48.381 --> 01:14:52.036
 TO THE WORLD WITH LUCK AND 
WITH, YOU KNOW, HEALTH.  YOU 

01:14:52.037 --> 01:14:55.106
THANK GOD THAT YOU ACTUALLY SAID
 SOMETHING THAT

01:14:58.534 --> 01:15:03.211
 RESONATES AMONG MANY PEOPLE AND
 ONE OF THE THINGS THAT YOU WISH

01:15:03.212 --> 01:15:06.753
 YOU ARTICULATED BETTER.  
AND I FEEL THAT I WRITE 

01:15:06.892 --> 01:15:09.419
SOMETHING THAT I DON'T TRULY 
CONTROL AND I CAN JUST FEEL THAT

01:15:09.909 --> 01:15:13.948
 THERE IS A LIGHTNESS THAT IS 
EMERGING OUT OF WHAT I DO.  AND 

01:15:14.220 --> 01:15:18.340
YOU HAVE OTHER PEOPLE, YOU KNOW,
 RECOGNIZE THAT DURING THE WHOLE

01:15:18.540 --> 01:15:22.836
 PROCESS, I AM WRITING SOMETHING
 THAT YOU HAVEN'T READ BEFORE.

01:15:24.096 --> 01:15:28.028
YOU KNOW, IT'S AN ASSUMPTION.  I
 THINK IT'S THE FEELING THAT YOU

01:15:28.029 --> 01:15:31.887
 HAVE WHEN HAVING SOMETHING PASS
 THROUGH YOU IS VERY MUCH A 

01:15:32.013 --> 01:15:35.851
RESULT OF THE FACT THAT YOU 
LIVED VERY MUCH MORE DEEPLY IN A

01:15:36.308 --> 01:15:40.636
 CULTURE THAN YOU REALIZE THAT 
YOU DO OR YOU LIVE IN A HUMAN 

01:15:40.843 --> 01:15:43.554
COMMUNITY MORE DEEPLY THAN YOU 
REALIZE.  AND YOU CAN REALLY 

01:15:43.751 --> 01:15:48.724
TALK TO PEOPLE IN A WAY THAT IS 
MUCH MORE INWARD THAN YOU WOULD 

01:15:52.923 --> 01:15:54.923
EVER ANTICIPATE.  
SPEAKER:  THANK YOU.  I HAVE A 

01:15:54.965 --> 01:15:56.637
TOUGH ONE I THINK.  I HAVE A 
FRIEND OF MINE WHO IS AN ATHEIST

01:15:56.638 --> 01:15:58.638
 ATHEIST AND

01:15:59.742 --> 01:16:05.463
 HE SAYS IT CAN BE BOILED DOWN 
TO WHAT CAN BE DONE.  AND 

01:16:05.611 --> 01:16:09.869
EVERYTHING ELSE IN THE BIBLE IS 
DISCERNING WHAT GOD'S WILL IS.  

01:16:10.015 --> 01:16:13.495
AND WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT SCIENCE,
 IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU DON'T MAKE A

01:16:14.020 --> 01:16:16.027
 HECK OF A LOT OF DISTINCT 
BETWEEN HOW MUCH YOU APPLY 

01:16:16.520 --> 01:16:18.520
BEAUTY TO GOOD AND EVIL AND

01:16:20.972 --> 01:16:24.714
 TRAGEDY WITH PERSEVERANCE IN 
YOUR NOVELS.  SO THE QUESTION IS

01:16:24.851 --> 01:16:26.851
 HOW DO

01:16:28.420 --> 01:16:30.420
 YOU DISCERN GOD'S WILL?  

01:16:32.798 --> 01:16:34.914
[LAUGHTER].  
SPEAKER:  WELL, YOU KNOW, I 

01:16:35.046 --> 01:16:42.811
CLING TO BASIC PROHIBITIONS.  NO
 IDOLATRY, NO STEALING, NO 

01:16:42.921 --> 01:16:48.276
KILLING.  BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, 
AGAIN, THIS IS JUST -- MY LIFE 

01:16:50.680 --> 01:16:54.286
SURPRISES ME ALL THE TIME.  
THERE ARE THINGS THAT HAVE KEPT 

01:16:54.453 --> 01:16:57.387
MY INTEREST, AND THINGS THAT I 
WANT TO DO.  AND I DO THEM.  AND

01:16:57.572 --> 01:17:03.908
 THEY SATISFY THE DO-NO HARM 
ETHIC.  AND NATURE CONTEXT 

01:17:04.099 --> 01:17:06.099
INSIDE.  AND I HOPE THEY ARE 
CONSISTENT WITH THE WORD OF GOD.

01:17:06.177 --> 01:17:10.578
AND I FIND THAT TO BE A VERY 
PLEASING IDEA.  YOU KNOW, WHO 

01:17:10.758 --> 01:17:12.915
KNOWS.  
SPEAKER:  DID I IMAGINE THIS OR 

01:17:13.342 --> 01:17:17.884
DID YOU BOIL DOWN THE BIBLE 
SOMEWHAT DIFFERENTLY AT ONE 

01:17:18.682 --> 01:17:23.233
POINT TO CUT IT OUT?  
SPEAKER:  THE NATION SO 

01:17:23.593 --> 01:17:25.593
SERIOUSLY RAGED TOGETHER.  
[LAUGHTER]. 

01:17:36.996 --> 01:17:40.982
DISCERNING GOD'S WILL.  WE 
HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT THE BOOK AT

01:17:41.298 --> 01:17:44.662
 ALL.  I AM WONDERING IF YOU 
MIGHT SAY A FEW WORDS ABOUT  

01:17:44.663 --> 01:17:46.663
ABOUT THAT. 

01:17:52.208 --> 01:17:56.781
 BOOK IN MY CAREER CALLED 
"MOTHER COUNTRY" WHICH IS ABOUT 

01:17:56.782 --> 01:18:02.028
THE PROCESSING PLANT ON THE 
COAST OF ENGLAND THAT HAS MADE 

01:18:02.029 --> 01:18:09.917
THE IRISH SEA THE MOST 
RADIOACTIVE BODY OF WATER IN THE

01:18:10.501 --> 01:18:15.850
 WORLD AND IT'S A WHOLE INDUSTRY
 THAT INVOLVES BUILDING WASTE 

01:18:16.311 --> 01:18:22.742
THAT CANNOT BE STORED OVER TIME.
AND MODERATED REACTORS AND THEY 

01:18:22.943 --> 01:18:24.943
SELL THEM ALL OVER

01:18:28.369 --> 01:18:34.798
 THE WORLD AND THINGS COME BACK 
TO THE COAST OF ENGLAND TO BE 

01:18:34.799 --> 01:18:39.542
STRIPPED DOWN INTO A FORM AS THE
 WASTE WOULD DO OTHERWISE AND 

01:18:39.543 --> 01:18:43.201
CAN'T BE STORED LIKE THE WATER 
REACTOR WASTE HAVE BEEN

01:18:46.681 --> 01:18:54.852
 SO FAR.  SO IN ANY CASE, THEY 
STRIP THESE THINGS DOWN AND SO 

01:18:58.026 --> 01:19:06.124
ON, A GREAT DEAL OF WASTE, AND 
URANIUM, ET CETERA, AND 

01:19:07.840 --> 01:19:12.952
ISOTOPES.  AND WHATEVER, AS OF 
THIS SYSTEM THAT HAS BEEN GOING 

01:19:12.953 --> 01:19:19.296
ON SINCE THE 50S, GO SIT DOWN 
THE PIPELINE BY THE IRISH SEA.  

01:19:19.297 --> 01:19:23.945
AND THIS HAS HAPPENED FOR SO 
LONG AT SUCH SCALE THAT IT HAS 

01:19:23.946 --> 01:19:25.946
AFFECTED THE 

01:19:30.603 --> 01:19:37.839
SCANDAVANAVIAN COUNTRIES, 
ICELAND, SO ON.  IN ENGLAND, GOT

01:19:38.169 --> 01:19:40.522
 RESPECTABLE SOURCES LIKE THE 
LONDON TIMES THAT THIS WAS GOING

01:19:40.728 --> 01:19:45.522
 ON.  AND I WROTE A BOOK ABOUT 
IT.  PEOPLE IN ENGLAND READ IT 

01:19:45.523 --> 01:19:50.776
AND THEY TALK TO ME ABOUT IT.  
AND OF COURSE IT DOES COME FROM 

01:19:52.268 --> 01:19:54.542
PLACES.  AND PEOPLE IN THE 
UNITED STATES ARE NOT ATTRACTED 

01:19:54.543 --> 01:19:57.252
TO THE SUBJECT.  
THEY WOULD RATHER -- THEY DON'T 

01:19:57.364 --> 01:20:06.438
WANT TO KNOW THIS IS GOING ON 
VERY NEAR DEATH COTTAGE.  SO 

01:20:08.346 --> 01:20:12.720
THAT IS SUMMER FIELD.  AND I DID
 FEEL I WAS RELIGIOUSLY 

01:20:12.721 --> 01:20:18.564
OBLIGATED TO WRITE THAT BOOK.  
SPEAKER:  EACH OF YOU HAS USED 

01:20:18.775 --> 01:20:21.532
THE WORD BELIEF MORE THAN ONCE 
IN THIS REALLY WONDERFUL AND

01:20:25.958 --> 01:20:29.485
 LIVELY CONVERSATION AND 
STRAIGHTFORWARD ORTHODOX 

01:20:29.602 --> 01:20:34.355
UNDERSTANDING, AN EXTENT TO A 
PROPOSITIONAL STATEMENT.  I 

01:20:34.472 --> 01:20:39.237
BELIEVE IN GOD THE FATHER, ALL 
MIGHTY HEAVEN AND EARTH AND SO 

01:20:39.349 --> 01:20:41.808
ON.  I AM WONDERING IF YOU CAN 
SAY MORE ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIPS

01:20:41.937 --> 01:20:46.023
 BETWEEN BELIEF AND STORY, OR 
PERHAPS FAITH AND NARRATIVE THAT

01:20:46.863 --> 01:20:55.199
 COMPLICATES BELIEF A LITTLE BIT
 MORE.  

01:20:55.200 --> 01:21:03.726
SPEAKER:  I THINK THAT, YOU 
KNOW, I DON'T HAVE A CREED SORT 

01:21:03.959 --> 01:21:07.495
OF BELIEF.  YES, THERE IS CREED 
WITHOUT DIFFICULTY.  BUT AT THE 

01:21:07.762 --> 01:21:11.424
SAME TIME, I DON'T FEEL BELIEF 
AT ALL AS IF IT WAS ITEMIZED AND

01:21:12.322 --> 01:21:16.422
 THERE WERE BOXES THAT I HAD TO 
CHECK OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.  

01:21:16.575 --> 01:21:19.576
SO BASICALLY IT'S QUESTIONING, 
YOU KNOW, WHAT IS IN THIS 

01:21:19.694 --> 01:21:25.140
MOMENT?  WHAT IS IN THIS EVENT? 
WITH THE ASSUMPTION THAT 

01:21:25.380 --> 01:21:30.728
EVERYTHING IS INCREDIBLY 
PRECIOUS.  THAT NOTHING IS -- 

01:21:31.190 --> 01:21:33.190
NOTHING THAT HAPPENED HOWEVER, 

01:21:39.171 --> 01:21:42.767
ININEXPLICABLE IS DONE WITHOUT 
THE FACT THAT EVERYTHING IS 

01:21:42.884 --> 01:21:46.867
PRECIOUS.  IT'S NOT A STATE OF 
OPPOSE FOR ME.  AND YOU KNOW, AS

01:21:47.203 --> 01:21:51.758
 THE CREATOR OF SOCIAL 
STATEMENTS, I FIND THAT THEY ARE

01:21:51.910 --> 01:21:54.485
 HUMAN RIGHTS.  AND I WOULD SAY 
IT.  AND MAYBE SOME OF THEM ARE 

01:21:54.486 --> 01:21:58.720
NOT EXACTLY ON THE FRONT.  YOU 
KNOW, THAT'S FINE WITH ME.  YOU 

01:21:58.844 --> 01:22:01.851
KNOW.  
SPEAKER:  THANK YOU.  

01:22:01.852 --> 01:22:04.436
SPEAKER:  YOU'RE WELCOME.  
SPEAKER:  FIRST I JUST WOULD 

01:22:05.107 --> 01:22:11.047
LIKE TO SAY THAT IT'S AN HONOR 
TO BE IN THE PRESENCE OF SO MANY

01:22:11.165 --> 01:22:15.912
 OF MY FAVORITE WRITERS.  THANK 
YOU FOR BRINGING THIS 

01:22:16.630 --> 01:22:20.991
CONVERSATION TOGETHER.  
MARILYNNE, I HAVE READ GILIAD 

01:22:21.267 --> 01:22:23.267
MORE THAN ONCE AND DEEPLY LOVED

01:22:25.047 --> 01:22:28.603
 THE BOOK.  AND I THINK ONE OF 
THE MOST POWERFUL ASPECTS OF 

01:22:29.872 --> 01:22:33.363
GILIAD IS THE COMPLICATED 
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FATHERS AND

01:22:34.059 --> 01:22:37.562
 SONS IN A GENERAL SENSE.  AND I
 THINK IN A LOT OF TEAMS, 

01:22:37.563 --> 01:22:39.563
LEADERS

01:22:40.696 --> 01:22:44.432
 FOCUS ON ONE OF THOSE 
RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN A FATHER 

01:22:44.767 --> 01:22:49.254
AND A SON, AND FOR ME IT'S THE 
TRIO OF THE GRANDFATHER, THE 

01:22:50.915 --> 01:22:55.221
FATHER AND THE SON.  AND I THINK
 HISTORY IS SO PERVASIVE IN 

01:22:56.249 --> 01:23:01.457
GILIAD AND I THINK IT'S SO 
FOREIGN IN THE THREE 

01:23:01.569 --> 01:23:07.229
GENERATIONS.  THE MESSAGE IS 
THAT GILIAD IS CONVEYED, AND I 

01:23:07.570 --> 01:23:11.033
WOULD LIKE YOU TO SPEAK MORE 
ABOUT THAT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN 

01:23:11.150 --> 01:23:11.723
HISTORY AND FATHER HOOD.  IN 
THIS MOMENT IN TIME, I JUST  

01:23:11.724 --> 01:23:13.724
JUST CAN'T HELP

01:23:16.167 --> 01:23:19.162
 BUT THINK ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE 
OF ABOLITIONIST

01:23:24.135 --> 01:23:27.775
 HISTORY AND THE MOMENT THAT 
WE'RE IN AND THE NARROWER THINKS

01:23:27.942 --> 01:23:33.521
 SO MUCH ABOUT HIS GRANDFATHER 
AND THE ABOLITION MOMENT THAT HE

01:23:34.355 --> 01:23:37.760
 IS LIVING IN.  AND HE IS LIVING
 IN THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOMENT.  

01:23:38.710 --> 01:23:43.339
SPEAKER:  WHEN I WENT TO IOWA --
I ALWAYS LIVED EITHER IN IDAHO 

01:23:43.493 --> 01:23:47.499
OR MASSACHUSETTS.  I WAS ALWAYS,
 YOU KNOW, ONE END OF THE

01:23:51.450 --> 01:23:55.173
 COUNTRY OR ANOTHER.  AND I WAS 
IN IOWA AND I WANTED TO KNOW 

01:23:55.174 --> 01:24:00.225
WHAT THE HISTORY OF THE PLACE 
WAS, AND WHAT THE CULTURE OF THE

01:24:00.358 --> 01:24:07.051
 PLACE WAS.  AND EVIDENTLY, 
IOWANS WOULD SAY THEY HAVE NO 

01:24:07.322 --> 01:24:09.996
HISTORY. 
YOU CAN'T HAVE TWO PEOPLE IN ONE

01:24:11.312 --> 01:24:14.419
 ROOM FOR THREE HOURS WITHOUT

01:24:17.445 --> 01:24:21.373
 HAVING A HISTORY.  AND DOING 
ALL KINDS OF PRIMARY RESEARCH IN

01:24:21.374 --> 01:24:27.585
 THE 19TH CENTURY.  AND SO I 
FOUND OUT THAT THEY HAVE THE 

01:24:27.586 --> 01:24:32.014
FORGOTTEN HISTORY OF THE LITTLE 
TOWNS ON WHAT WAS IN THE 

01:24:34.725 --> 01:24:39.437
FRONTIER, THEY ESTABLISHED IN 
ORDER TO INFILTRATE AN ETHICAL 

01:24:39.753 --> 01:24:46.167
ABOLITIONISM IN THE U.S.  VERY 
SUCCESSFUL AT THAT.  AND THEY 

01:24:46.298 --> 01:24:52.570
TEND TO BE BASED AROUND.  AND 
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT STRUCK ME

01:24:52.702 --> 01:24:59.245
 WHEN I MOVED TO THE U.S. WERE 
LANDSCAPES AND COLONIES AND/OR 

01:24:59.731 --> 01:25:02.240
CHURCHES, THESE PEOPLE WOULD BUY
 FROM THE GOVERNMENT, IT WAS 

01:25:02.241 --> 01:25:06.817
VERY CHEAP.  AND THEY WOULD 
BUILD A COLLEGE.  THEY HAD 

01:25:07.900 --> 01:25:09.900
PATRONS. 

01:25:12.418 --> 01:25:16.704
WOULD SELL THE PLACE.  AND 
PEOPLE MOVED WEST AND WANTED TO 

01:25:17.280 --> 01:25:20.468
BE NEAR A COLLEGE OR CHURCH AND 
THE PROPERTY VALUE WOULD GO UP 

01:25:20.743 --> 01:25:25.352
AND USE IT TO UNDER WRITE WHAT 
THEY HAVE SPOKEN OF.  AND START 

01:25:26.210 --> 01:25:29.385
NEW TOWNS WITH NEW COLLEGES AND 
NEW CHURCHES AND YOU HAVE WHAT 

01:25:30.021 --> 01:25:33.322
IS CRUCIALLY IMPORTANT FROM 
AMERICAN HISTORY.  AND 

01:25:34.724 --> 01:25:37.606
ANTI-SLAVERY MIDDLE WEST THAT 
PRODUCED PEOPLE LIKE LINCOLN AND

01:25:37.820 --> 01:25:43.881
 GRANT AND SHERMAN AND SO ON.  
AND ALSO TREMENDOUS UNION ARMY 

01:25:44.344 --> 01:25:49.773
IN THE PERIOD.  IN THE LATEST 
STAGES OF THE WAR.  SO YOU KNOW,

01:25:50.056 --> 01:25:58.029
 SO I SAW FOR MYSELF, A 
REMARKABLE HISTORY OF VERY, VERY

01:25:58.150 --> 01:26:00.150
 GREAT

01:26:02.532 --> 01:26:05.146
 IMPORTANCE.  YOU KNOW.  
WITHIN A VERY SHORT PERIOD OF 

01:26:06.524 --> 01:26:10.002
TIME.  AND GOING THROUGH THE 
SCHOOLS.  AND HAVE MANY OF THE 

01:26:10.135 --> 01:26:15.336
SORT OF CULTURAL QUALITIES THAT 
CAME FROM THEM.  FOR EXAMPLE, NO

01:26:17.283 --> 01:26:21.326
 SEGREGATION IN SCHOOL AND 
ANTI-SEGREGATION LAWS AND THOSE 

01:26:21.642 --> 01:26:25.753
KINDS OF THINGS.  SO ANYWAY, THE
 PHENOMENON OF THE HISTORICAL 

01:26:27.008 --> 01:26:32.782
FORGETFULNESS OF THAT LEVEL, 
HAVE ALL OF THE PEOPLE, PEOPLE 

01:26:33.252 --> 01:26:36.858
OUT THERE DOING ADMIRABLE 
THINGS, IF WE HAD PERSISTED IN 

01:26:37.003 --> 01:26:40.443
THEM, WOULD HAVE SAVED ALL KINDS
 OF MISERY AND REINVENTIONS OF 

01:26:40.746 --> 01:26:42.746
WHEELS AND SO

01:26:45.190 --> 01:26:48.999
 ON.  I MEAN, PEOPLE ACTUALLY 
FELT WHEN I WAS A CHILD, THAT 

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000
INTEGRATING

01:26:52.892 --> 01:26:56.286
 SCHOOLS WAS A NOVEL IDEA.  AND 
THE COUNTRY HAS DONE IT BEFORE. 

01:26:56.577 --> 01:27:01.225
AND THE CULTURE OF FORGETFULNESS
 IS THAT IT CAN BE A DEVASTATING

01:27:01.354 --> 01:27:03.745
 LOSS.  AND THAT'S ONE OF THE 
THINGS THAT IS A MAJOR SUBJECT 

01:27:03.875 --> 01:27:08.247
IN THE GULIAD NOVEL.  
SPEAKER:  WE'RE DOWN IN THE LAST

01:27:08.394 --> 01:27:12.996
 FEW MINUTES.  AND PERHAPS WE 
CAN TAKE IN IN TURN, WE HAVE 

01:27:12.997 --> 01:27:15.454
THREE ON THIS SIDE, TWO ON THAT.

01:27:15.455 --> 01:27:18.559
PERHAPS IF WE CAN TAKE THE THREE
 FOLKS ROUND UP OVER HERE AND IF

01:27:18.680 --> 01:27:21.378
 YOU CAN ASK YOUR QUESTIONS IN 
TURN AND WE WILL STORE THEM UP 

01:27:23.375 --> 01:27:27.784
AND SEE WHAT PARTS OF THEM 
EITHER MARILYNNE ROBINSON OR ANY

01:27:27.905 --> 01:27:31.175
 MEMBERS OF THE PANEL WOULD LIKE
 TO ANSWER.  WE'LL START WITH 

01:27:31.317 --> 01:27:33.317
YOU.  
SPEAKER:  SURE.  THANK YOU FOR 

01:27:33.329 --> 01:27:37.159
ALL BEING HERE TONIGHT.  IT WAS 
LOVELY.  EARLIER IN THE 

01:27:37.301 --> 01:27:40.520
CONVERSATION, SOMEONE MENTIONED 
GULIAD AND NOT BEING ABLE TO 

01:27:40.645 --> 01:27:46.414
IMAGINE GULIAD IN A TIME AFTER 
TIME MAGAZINE HAS IMAGINED IF 

01:27:47.821 --> 01:27:52.193
GOD IS DEAD.  AND DOESN'T 
PERCEIVE TOO FAR IN THE 

01:27:53.056 --> 01:27:56.132
DISTANCE.  I WONDER IN A LOT OF 
THESE CONVERSATIONS WHAT SORT OF

01:27:56.655 --> 01:27:59.723
 SPIRITUAL CONSCIOUSNESS HAS 
BEEN, AND IF IT HAS BEEN LOST, 

01:27:59.724 --> 01:28:05.205
LOST, HOW DO WE ARTICULATE THAT 
AS MORE THAN JUST DECLINING 

01:28:05.206 --> 01:28:09.278
CHURCH ATTENDANCE?  ALONG WITH 
THAT QUESTION, WHERE DO YOU FIND

01:28:09.279 --> 01:28:12.400
 THE MOST INTERESTING COMPELLING
 ARTICULATION IN FAITH AND 

01:28:13.177 --> 01:28:17.186
IMAGINATION MOVING FORWARD 
ESPECIALLY IN OUR PUBLIC 

01:28:17.317 --> 01:28:19.317
CONSCIENCE?  
SPEAKER:  I ACTUALLY

01:28:23.319 --> 01:28:31.484
 WANTED TO ASK, I WAS VERY -- I 
WAS VERY INTRIGUED BY THE 

01:28:31.485 --> 01:28:35.522
PREMISE -- ONE OF THE PREMISES 
THAT AMERICA HAS A GENERAL MORE 

01:28:35.523 --> 01:28:43.677
SOCIAL ASPECT THAN GREAT BRITAIN
 AND GOES INTO THE HISTORY OF 

01:28:43.678 --> 01:28:49.860
SOCIAL REFORM.  
AND I WAS WONDERING HOW YOU CAN 

01:28:50.911 --> 01:28:55.377
INTERPRET SOME POLITICAL EVENTS 
IN AMERICA AND THE AMERICAN  

01:28:50.511 --> 01:28:52.511
SOCIAL 

01:28:54.154 --> 01:28:59.058
NORMS THAT YOU INVESTIGATED IN 
THAT THAT BOOK.  

01:28:59.059 --> 01:29:05.730
SPEAKER:  THANK YOU.  THIS HAS 
BEEN A REALLY ENLIGHTENING 

01:29:05.731 --> 01:29:13.702
CONVERSATION IN MANY WAYS.  MY 
QUESTION IS PROMPT BY THE 

01:29:13.972 --> 01:29:17.837
GENTLEMAN WHO SHARED THE BELIEF 
AND RESPONSE.  AND IN MY OWN 

01:29:18.060 --> 01:29:21.745
LIFE, AND MY OWN RESEARCH, I 
THINK ABOUT RELIGIOUS PRACTICE 

01:29:22.080 --> 01:29:27.961
MORE THAN I DO ABOUT RELIGIOUS 
BELIEF.  AND WHEN YOU SPEAK 

01:29:28.188 --> 01:29:31.404
ABOUT BELIEF AS A PLACE, I'M 
WONDERING ABOUT PRACTICE.  I'M 

01:29:32.376 --> 01:29:37.083
WONDERING ABOUT MOMENTS WHEN 
BELIEF FILTERS.  AND I'M ALSO

01:29:40.990 --> 01:29:45.468
 WONDERING ABOUT THE WAYS IN 
WHICH PEOPLE ENACT AND LIVE OUT 

01:29:45.782 --> 01:29:51.522
THEIR COMMITMENT AND THOSE 
ACTIONS AND JUST WHAT KINDS OF 

01:29:55.902 --> 01:29:59.041
CONNECTIONS YOU WOULD MAKE 
BETWEEN BELIEF AND PRACTICE AND 

01:29:59.398 --> 01:29:59.501
WHAT ABSENCE MIGHT LOOK LIKE 
SOMETIMES IN THE FAULT OF  

01:29:59.502 --> 01:30:01.502
BELIEF. 

01:30:10.572 --> 01:30:15.831
THINK THAT -- I THINK OF MYSELF 
AS FILTERING. 

01:30:19.307 --> 01:30:23.051
 IT HAPPENS TO BE TRUE THAT YOU 
KNOW, THIS SORT OF AESTHETIC 

01:30:23.052 --> 01:30:29.189
ABOUT THE PHYSICAL AND THE 
SCIENTIFIC WAYS I UNDERSTAND, 

01:30:29.190 --> 01:30:34.354
IT'S VERY SATISFYING TO ME.  IT 
SEEMS CORRESPONDING TO ME.  AND 

01:30:34.355 --> 01:30:39.931
YOU KNOW, IF I ASSIGN MYSELF NOT
 POSITIONED TO IT, I DON'T BRING

01:30:40.123 --> 01:30:43.965
 IT.  I DON'T KNOW WHAT I MEAN? 
 I DON'T TURN.

01:30:43.966 --> 01:30:50.464
I THINK THAT ANY RELIGION 
TEACHES PRACTICE.  AND I THINK 

01:30:51.251 --> 01:30:54.124
CERTAINLY CHRISTIANITY TEACHES 
GENEROSITY AND COMPASSION.  AND 

01:30:54.553 --> 01:31:00.023
THAT IS THE ESSENTIAL PRACTICE I
 THINK IN IN BOTH OF THOSE 

01:31:00.136 --> 01:31:03.771
FAITHS.  AND I THINK FAITH IS 
REJUVENATED BY THE PRACTICES 

01:31:04.658 --> 01:31:10.383
THAT ARE SIMPLE TO IT LIKE 
COMPASSION.  

01:31:10.384 --> 01:31:12.550
SPEAKER:  AS FAR AS, YOU KNOW, 
IN AMERICA, THERE HAS ALWAYS  

01:31:12.551 --> 01:31:18.062
BEEN A VERY COMPLEX RELATIONSHIP
 BETWEEN THEM THAT IS ECONOMIC 

01:31:18.063 --> 01:31:22.206
AS MUCH AS ANYTHING.  IF YOU 
LOOK AT LAWS FOR THE WORKING 

01:31:22.207 --> 01:31:26.845
CLASS IN THE 19TH CENTURY 
ENGLAND AND LOOK AT THE LAWS 

01:31:26.846 --> 01:31:30.072
THAT HAVE CONTROLLED THE 
ENSLAVED PEOPLE IN THE SOUTH.  

01:31:30.073 --> 01:31:32.073
THEY ARE

01:31:35.450 --> 01:31:38.985
 ALMOST IDENTICAL.  YOU KNOW, 
THERE IS A HISTORY OF 

01:31:38.986 --> 01:31:42.042
EXPLOITATION OF THE WORKING 
CLASS THAT IN ENGLAND, I MEAN, 

01:31:42.043 --> 01:31:48.777
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE USED TO TALK 
ABOUT WAGE DISPLACEMENT.  

01:31:48.778 --> 01:31:55.168
AND THEY HAD EVERY REASON TO 
CALL IT THAT.  THE MOVEMENT -- 

01:31:55.393 --> 01:31:58.859
THE KIND OF ECONOMICS THAT I 
CRITICIZED IN ANOTHER COUNTRY AS

01:31:59.159 --> 01:32:03.098
 BEING BRITISH IS SIMPLY THE 
IDEA THAT EVERYTHING AT BEST IS 

01:32:04.472 --> 01:32:07.475
REDUCED TO LIQUID MONEY.  THAT 
IS CAPITALISTS.  YOU KNOW, YOU 

01:32:07.610 --> 01:32:11.048
SQUEEZE THE MONEY OUT OF HERE 
AND YOU CAN PUT IT THERE.  

01:32:11.049 --> 01:32:16.239
SQUEEZE THE MONEY OUT OF THERE 
AND PUT IT THERE.  YOU KNOW, IF 

01:32:16.456 --> 01:32:19.225
THINGS START FILLING NATIONAL 
ASSETS, WE WOULD BE TAKING ON 

01:32:20.135 --> 01:32:23.375
ECONOMIC ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE 
VERY CLOSE TO OUR BRITISH 

01:32:23.711 --> 01:32:29.742
ORIGINS.  AND THEIR IDEA THAT 
ACTUALLY CAPITALS, YOU KNOW, 

01:32:30.607 --> 01:32:34.874
MARX'S WORD IS THE ULTIMATE 
PERFORM OF PROPERTY.  AND WITH 

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:39.012
ANYTHING ELSE IS BASICALLY 
REDUCIBLE TO -- IT HAS THE VALUE

01:32:39.184 --> 01:32:47.363
 OF WHAT CAN BE REDUCED TO IT IN
 TERMS OF LIQUID WEALTH.  THAT'S

01:32:47.501 --> 01:32:51.147
 WHY YOU HAVE THINGS IN THE 
FIELD.  AND MY CONCLUSION, IT 

01:32:51.653 --> 01:32:55.378
GENERATES A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY 
AND THE COST OF IT IS NOT FELT 

01:32:55.738 --> 01:32:57.738
BY THE PEOPLE WHO APPRECIATE THE
 WEALTH THAT IS

01:33:00.113 --> 01:33:02.752
 GENERATED BY IT. 
WHEN YOU HAVE THAT ASSUMPTION, 

01:33:02.891 --> 01:33:07.368
YOU KNOW, ALL SORTS OF BARRIERS 
GO DOWN.  

01:33:07.369 --> 01:33:09.956
SPEAKER:  SO FROM THE FIRST 
QUESTION, I TOOK ONE ELEMENT OF 

01:33:10.197 --> 01:33:13.906
IT WHICH I THOUGHT WAS 
INTRIGUING.  DO YOU FEEL HAVING 

01:33:14.123 --> 01:33:18.093
SET YOUR NOVELS AS WE SAID IN 
THE VERY OUTSET, IN THE DISTANT

01:33:21.357 --> 01:33:25.384
 BUT NOT TOO DISTANT PATH BEFORE
 GOD ENTERED THE CULTURE, HAVE 

01:33:25.385 --> 01:33:29.062
WE LOST OUR SPIRITUAL IDENTITIES
 SINCE THEN?  OR IS IT THE 

01:33:29.742 --> 01:33:32.946
CONTINUATION OF THE SAME STORY? 
DO YOU SEE A 

01:33:37.882 --> 01:33:41.139
DISCONTINUITY THERE AND WHERE DO
 YOU SEE HOPE IN THE ELEMENT OF 

01:33:41.140 --> 01:33:44.663
TODAY'S CULTURE?  
SPEAKER:  WELL, YOU KNOW, I HAVE

01:33:44.803 --> 01:33:50.548
 BEEN AROUND IN EUROPE QUITE A 
BIT AND IN THE UNITED STATES.  

01:33:50.691 --> 01:33:53.697
AND IN EUROPE INTERESTINGLY 
ENOUGH, I'M ASKED ABOUT THEOLOGY

01:33:55.584 --> 01:34:00.320
 AND NEWSPAPER INTERVIEWS ABOUT 
THEOLOGY.  I HAVE COME TO

01:34:03.817 --> 01:34:06.734
 THE CONCLUSION THAT

01:34:10.106 --> 01:34:15.772
 THE SECULARISM IN THE WESTERN 
PART OF THE WORLD IS ONE-EIGHTH 

01:34:15.773 --> 01:34:19.552
OF AN INCH DEEP.  
AND IT COMES PROFOUNDLY 

01:34:19.681 --> 01:34:25.213
NATURALLY TO KEEP AND SIMPLY 
INVOLVES, YOU KNOW, TO ENGAGE A 

01:34:25.387 --> 01:34:29.788
KIND OF, YOU KNOW, THINKING THAT
 PEOPLE WILL CALL NAIVE AND WE 

01:34:29.906 --> 01:34:35.955
ARE SO TERRIFIED OF THAT WORD.  
SO I DON'T THINK, YOU KNOW, 

01:34:36.674 --> 01:34:41.379
THERE ARE OTHER CONVERSATIONS 
THAT LEVEL, YOU KNOW, GOD IS 

01:34:41.535 --> 01:34:49.262
DEAD AND THAT KIND OF STUFF.  
AND OF COURSE, YOU KNOW, TO 

01:34:49.674 --> 01:34:51.674
SPEAK OF THE RADICAL EVENT OF 
CRUCIFIXION, HE USES THE THE 

01:34:54.646 --> 01:34:59.256
SENTENCE GOD IS DEAD.  AND THE 
RELIGIOUS CONTENT BEFORE IT WAS 

01:34:59.380 --> 01:35:01.380
MADE INTO SOMETHING ELSE. 

01:35:04.618 --> 01:35:11.479
 AND OUT OF THE EVENT, SAYING TO
 THE PUBLIC, SHHH, WE ARE 

01:35:11.480 --> 01:35:15.624
SUPPOSED TO PRETEND THAT WE 
DON'T BELIEVE IN THAT ANYMORE.  

01:35:15.625 --> 01:35:22.632
AND I THINK IT'S HUMAN NATURE TO
 SAY SOMETHING KEPT US GOING TO 

01:35:22.633 --> 01:35:28.147
EXPAND IN A WAY.  I DON'T THINK 
THAT'S DESCRIPTIVE OF IT AT ALL.

01:35:30.698 --> 01:35:34.910
THE LAST FEW QUESTIONS.  AND 
THEN IF WE HAVE TIME TO SAY A 

01:35:38.585 --> 01:35:41.053
PREVIOUS BRIEF SOMETHING.  
SPEAKER:  THANK YOU ALL FOR A 

01:35:41.604 --> 01:35:45.572
WONDERFUL SESSION AND A SERIES 
OF POWERFUL MOVING NOVELS.  I --

01:35:46.249 --> 01:35:50.096
I HEARD YOU ALL TALK QUITE A BIT
 ABOUT SOME OF THE VISIONARY 

01:35:50.391 --> 01:35:55.579
ASPECTS OF FAITH AND BELIEF AND 
THE ROLE OF BEAUTY IN 

01:35:55.580 --> 01:35:58.269
PARTICULAR.  ONE OF THE THINGS 
THAT WAS STRIKING TO ME IN THE 

01:36:02.163 --> 01:36:04.163
GILIAD TRILOLOGY IS THE THE 

01:36:04.459 --> 01:36:10.950
DIFFERENT STRING OF THOUGHT, THE
 USE OF TOTAL DEPRAVITY AND THE 

01:36:11.857 --> 01:36:15.778
WAY THAT JACK PERCEIVES OF HIS 
OWN EXPERIENCES AND FEARS MIGHT 

01:36:15.950 --> 01:36:24.882
BE CONDEMNED AND THE RAW 
DIFFICULTY THAT ESPECIALLY AIMS 

01:36:24.996 --> 01:36:28.057
AND FATHER HAVE IN TRYING AND 
NOT QUITE SUCCEEDING AT 

01:36:28.791 --> 01:36:32.946
FORGIVING HIM.  NOT PLAYING -- 
NOT BEING ABLE, PERHAPS, TO PLAY

01:36:33.079 --> 01:36:38.642
 THE ROLE OF THE FATHER AND THE 
SON THE WAY THEY WANT TO.  I AM 

01:36:38.762 --> 01:36:41.245
WONDERING IF YOU CAN SPEAK A BIT
 TO THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE

01:36:42.462 --> 01:36:48.332
 VISIONARY ASPECTS OF THE 
THOUGHTS AND THE MORAL DRAMA 

01:36:48.454 --> 01:36:50.454
THAT WE FIND IN THE SECOND HALF 
OF 

01:36:53.740 --> 01:36:58.031
GILIAD.  
SPEAKER:  WELL, THERE IS NOTHING

01:37:01.268 --> 01:37:06.176
 BUT FORGIVENESS.  THE WHOLE 
THEOLOGY IS BASED ON FORGIVING 

01:37:06.419 --> 01:37:08.419
JACK.  JACK DOESN'T FORGIVE

01:37:12.320 --> 01:37:14.891
 HIMSELF.  THE, YOU KNOW,

01:37:18.859 --> 01:37:21.693
 EVERY THEOLOGY HAS COMPLEX 
WORKING PARTS,

01:37:26.502 --> 01:37:30.349
 YOU KNOW, AND THE IDEA OF 
FALLING SHORT IS

01:37:34.040 --> 01:37:40.427
 I THINK INTRINSIC IN EVERY 
THEOLOGY AND TO SEE AND 

01:37:40.428 --> 01:37:44.727
EXPERIENCE BEAUTIFUL 
DEMONSTRATIONS OF BELIEF AND 

01:37:44.965 --> 01:37:46.965
FORGIVENESS, DOESN'T NECESSARILY
 MEAN THAT YOU ARE ALL RIGHT.  

01:37:47.801 --> 01:37:52.515
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?  SO 
BASICALLY ABOUT WHAT I CONSIDER 

01:37:53.059 --> 01:37:58.671
TO BE A PHENOMENON OF FAITH THAT
 IS VERY GENERAL IN RELIGIOUS

01:38:01.727 --> 01:38:04.769
 TRADITIONS.  AND AT LEAST THE 
ULTIMATE BENEFIT THAT IS REALLY 

01:38:04.903 --> 01:38:10.491
NOT UP TO HIM.  YOU KNOW, HE 
CAN'T 

01:38:14.501 --> 01:38:19.428
KNOW.  AND YOU KNOW, IT'S A NEW 
ROLL OF THE DICE WHEN YOU TALK 

01:38:19.429 --> 01:38:25.378
TO SOMEONE.  
SPEAKER:  THANK YOU.  OKAY.  

01:38:25.728 --> 01:38:29.735
LAST QUESTION BRIEFLY.  
SPEAKER:  THIS QUESTION IS FOR

01:38:35.719 --> 01:38:44.937
 ANYONE ON THE PANEL.  YOU 
PROVIDED ME WITH A STORY OF 

01:38:45.454 --> 01:38:49.150
ANOTHER WRITER WHICH OCCURRED 
RECENTLY, THE WRITER WHO LOST 

01:38:49.719 --> 01:38:51.719
THE ABILITY TO PRODUCE 

01:38:55.809 --> 01:39:00.612
TESTOSTERONE AND THESE TWO MEN 
EXPERIENCES EVERYTHING AS BEING 

01:39:00.868 --> 01:39:03.069
BEAUTIFUL BUT IN A -- HE 
DESCRIBES IT AS A COMPLETELY 

01:39:04.112 --> 01:39:06.112
OBJECTIVE.  AND HE JUST STOPS

01:39:09.862 --> 01:39:11.862
 JUDGE

01:39:17.142 --> 01:39:17.409
JUDGING THINGS.  HE WOULD SEE A 
CRACK IN THE SIDEWALK AND SAY 

01:39:17.410 --> 01:39:19.603
THAT IS BEAUTIFUL.  AND BUT AT 
THE SAME TIME, HE ALSO LOST ALL 

01:39:20.041 --> 01:39:22.041
OF THAT MOTIVATION TO DO 

01:39:24.899 --> 01:39:28.230
ANYTHING AS WELL.  AND I WAS 
JUST WONDERING IF MAYBE THIS 

01:39:28.448 --> 01:39:33.465
PRESENTS THE KIND OF METAPHOR 
ABOUT A CERTAIN TENSION BETWEEN 

01:39:35.035 --> 01:39:37.035
NOT JUDGING THINGS AND 
EXPERIENCING THINGS

01:39:40.841 --> 01:39:46.273
 AS BEAUTIFUL AS THEY ARE AND 
CERTAIN TENSION WITH ACTING AND 

01:39:46.274 --> 01:39:49.550
POSING THE WORLD ON A WAY WHERE 
YOU MIGHT HAVE A CERTAIN VISION 

01:39:49.551 --> 01:39:51.551
OF

01:39:53.723 --> 01:39:59.582
 BEAUTY OF YOUR OWN AND THAT 
WOULD YOU ALSO WANT TO INTERACT 

01:39:59.583 --> 01:40:01.573
WITH MATERIALS OR OUTSIDE WORLD.

01:40:01.574 --> 01:40:05.283
SPEAKER:  SO YOUR CONCERN IS 
WHAT AFFECT BEAUTY MIGHT HAVE ON

01:40:05.864 --> 01:40:07.020
 AGENCY?  IT IT MIGHT

01:40:07.021 --> 01:40:09.021
 BE IN SOME WAYS TODAY

01:40:14.055 --> 01:40:17.036
 DEBILITATING.  
SPEAKER:  A LACK OF JUDGMENT.  

01:40:17.600 --> 01:40:21.743
SPEAKER:  OKAY, DOES ANYBODY 
WANT TO TAKE THAT?  A QUICK 

01:40:22.354 --> 01:40:24.354
RESPONSE?  
SPEAKER:  WHY ME?  

01:40:28.319 --> 01:40:31.058
[LAUGHTER].  
SPEAKER:  I JUST THINK IT'S EASY

01:40:31.262 --> 01:40:33.262
 TO BECOME HABITUATED TO

01:40:36.324 --> 01:40:40.978
 A CULTURATED THINKING AND I 
THINK IT'S EASY TO BECOME 

01:40:41.800 --> 01:40:48.671
HABITUATED TO THINKING WHAT YOU 
THINK IS THOUGHT.  BUT IN FACT, 

01:40:48.672 --> 01:40:52.728
IT IS NOT THINKING.  [LAUGHTER].
  AGAIN.  

01:40:52.729 --> 01:40:55.592
I THINK IT'S, AT LEAST IN THE 
CONTEXT OF HOW WE HAVE BEEN 

01:40:55.765 --> 01:40:56.968
TALKING ABOUTTALKING ABOUT IT

01:40:56.969 --> 01:41:00.926
 UP HERE IS THAT IT IS ON A 
CERTAINLY

01:41:04.002 --> 01:41:07.793
 LEVEL, IT'S A TECHNICAL SKILL. 
 IT'S ALMOST LIKE A MUSCLE.  YOU

01:41:07.794 --> 01:41:13.104
 HAVE TO HABITUATE YOURSELF TO 
THE DISCIPLINE OF FEELING 

01:41:13.341 --> 01:41:17.060
BEAUTY.  
AND THE BEAUTIFUL PARADOXICAL 

01:41:17.288 --> 01:41:26.508
KIND OF DISCIPLINE.  BECAUSE 
WHAT IT IS, IS CULTIVATING THE 

01:41:26.672 --> 01:41:31.846
ABILITY TO STOP THE WILL AND 
BEAUTY IN EVERYTHING YOU SEE.  

01:41:32.375 --> 01:41:34.477
AND RESERVING JUDGMENT AND NOT 
ACTING AS IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU 

01:41:34.628 --> 01:41:40.591
ARE LOOKING AT.  AND YOU ARE 
REALLY TRYING TO CULTIVATE THE 

01:41:40.774 --> 01:41:45.269
HABIT OF THE INNOCENT, YOU DON'T
 KNOW WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING AT.  

01:41:45.419 --> 01:41:48.438
AND THE CRACK IN THE PAVEMENT IS
 LIKELY TO BE QUITE BEAUTIFUL 

01:41:48.439 --> 01:41:50.975
AND HAVE ITS OWN LITTLE ECO 
SYSTEM. 

01:41:50.976 --> 01:41:57.543
AND THE IDEA TOO, THAT THE 
CLOSER AND THE MORE SUSTAINED 

01:41:57.902 --> 01:42:02.184
THE TENSION IS, THE MORE DEPTH 
-- THE UNIVERSE IS ALL 

01:42:04.335 --> 01:42:06.234
OBSERVATION WILL ALWAYS 
ACCOMMODATE WHAT DEPTHS OF 

01:42:06.235 --> 01:42:08.671
ACCOMMODATION YOU CHOOSE TO LEND
 TO IT.  AND ALL HAS COME INTO 

01:42:08.808 --> 01:42:12.111
MORE AND MORE BEAUTIFUL 
RESOLUTION.  AND I THINK THAT IS

01:42:12.232 --> 01:42:16.133
 WHEN YOU SEE THINGS THAT WE 
TALK ABOUT A LOT, THE POSITION 

01:42:16.134 --> 01:42:23.961
AND CAUSE A BARRACK BETWEEN THE 
INFINITE AND YOU CAN GO DOWN TO 

01:42:25.191 --> 01:42:28.323
THE SMALLEST TINIEST DETAIL AND 
IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL, AND WILL JUST

01:42:29.369 --> 01:42:32.406
 OPEN BACK ON TO THE WHOLE 
UNIVERSE IN A CERTAIN WAY.  IT'S

01:42:32.526 --> 01:42:39.494
 ALMOST LIKE A FEEDBACK.  THAT'S
 JUST ME.  [LAUGHTER].  

01:42:39.495 --> 01:42:46.535
SPEAKER:  THAT SOUNDS TO BE LIKE
 THE RIGHT BALANCE OF 

01:42:46.674 --> 01:42:51.585
TESTOSTERONE.  [LAUGHTER].  ALL 
RIGHT.  WE ARE AT THE END OF OUR

01:42:51.869 --> 01:42:55.787
 TIME.  I AM GOING TO TURN THE 
PROGRAM BACK TO THE DIRECTOR OF 

01:42:55.958 --> 01:43:00.748
THE JOHN KLUGE CENTER, TED 
WIDMER.  AND BEFORE I DO SO, LET

01:43:00.904 --> 01:43:06.201
 ME ASK YOU TO THANK OUR GUESTS 
OF HONOR AND THE PANEL.  

01:43:06.202 --> 01:43:08.202
[APPLAUSE]. 

01:43:41.354 --> 01:44:00.572
INSPIRING EVENING AND THANK YOU 
FOR COMING OUT.  LET'S NOT ONLY 

01:43:26.402 --> 01:43:29.669
APPLAUSE THE PANEL MEMBERS, BUT

01:43:29.833 --> 01:43:31.833
GOOD JOB TONIGHT.  

01:43:34.438 --> 01:43:37.722
[APPLAUSE].  
TWO VERY BRIEF ANNOUNCEMENTS, 

01:43:38.614 --> 01:43:41.490
WHEN YOU CAME IN WITH THE 
ANNOUNCEMENTS, YOU RECEIVED A 

01:43:42.016 --> 01:43:44.016
SURVEY.  WE'LLED

01:44:02.795 --> 01:44:13.614
 GRATEFUL IF YOU CAN FILL IT 
OUT.  AND GRATEFUL IF YOU CAN 

01:43:55.909 --> 01:43:58.692

PANELISTS WILL BE SIGNING BOOKS 

01:43:58.833 --> 01:44:04.742
IN THE WHITTALL PAVILION NEXT 
DOOR.  THANK YOU ALL FOR COMING.
