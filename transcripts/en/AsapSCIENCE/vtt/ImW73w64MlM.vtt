00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.260
Your heart races and your cheeks begin to
flush; as you anticipate the surge of energy

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:12.360
this win will bring, you move to the edge
of your seat - you can't get enough! So why

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.340
are we so passionately involved or obsessed
with sports?

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.610
Hormones control the way we feel and are stimulated
by every action we take. Hugging a friend

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:25.220
releases oxytocin making you feel calm, while
cramming for an exam releases cortisol leading

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:30.040
to irritability - but also alertness. Simply
watching sports stimulates hormone levels

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:34.860
as well. Testosterone in particular is a hormone
linked to dominance and social interaction,

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.580
but also increases brain power, spatial awareness
and muscle growth. And scientists have found

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:44.260
that after watching your team win, levels
of testosterone skyrocket, especially compared

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:49.200
to experiencing a loss. Funnily enough, this
has even been documented in politics: during

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.790
the 2008 US election, males who voted for
Obama were found to have much higher levels

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.320
of testosterone after he won, than those who
voted for McCain.

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.310
When your favourite athlete takes home the
gold, a surge of dopamine is also released.

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:06.000
This biological rush activates pleasure centres
in the brain while increasing memory and learning.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.679
This increased memory helps explain why some
people continue to watch sports - they're

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:13.490
looking to recreate the physiological excitement
they can't seem to forget.

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.289
The brain also contains cells called Mirror
Neurons which are not only activated when

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:21.960
completing an action, but also when viewing
it, or even hearing it. Certain mirror neurons

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.740
will be activated when throwing a ball, seeing
someone throw a ball, or even hearing the

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.579
word 'ball'. It's the reason we can 'put ourselves
in another's shoes, and why we experience

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:35.139
a similar emotional and physical reaction
to somebody else winning. In fact, scientists

00:01:35.139 --> 00:01:39.439
monitoring both athletes and spectators see
the same parts of the brain activated - as

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:43.329
if the viewer were playing the game. From
an evolutionary perspective, this allows us

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:47.429
to understand the mental states of others
and interpret their actions and intentions,

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:52.020
as well as empathize with them. It also helps
to explain why we find such pleasure and excitement

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.939
in seeing our favourite team or athlete become
a champion.

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:59.560
Curiously, scientists have found that some
people have problems with this mirror neuron system.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.479
This renders them unable to empathize with
others, leading to some social disorders.

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.009
At the extreme ends, serial killers have been
found to lack this mirror neuron system.

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.700
Science says, our obsession with sports may
be a great example of our adapted hormonal

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:17.100
and neuronal systems at work, keeping us connected
as the human race... while watching humans

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.900
race.

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.100
Don't forget: we have a new video out every day during the Olympics!
