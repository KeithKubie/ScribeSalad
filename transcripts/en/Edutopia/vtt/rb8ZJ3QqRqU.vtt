00:00:08.106 --> 00:00:12.706
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Today, we're going to
start our study of nuclear weapons,

00:00:12.706 --> 00:00:18.076
and atoms, and chemistry by giving
a little context to why some

00:00:18.076 --> 00:00:22.266
of this science-y stuff is
important to study about.

00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:24.936
&gt;&gt;Narrator: A bold experiment
in education is underway

00:00:24.936 --> 00:00:28.886
at Ascend School in the Fruitvale
neighborhood of Oakland, California.

00:00:28.886 --> 00:00:34.866
&gt;&gt;Elena: So I'd like you to write
down your feelings and thoughts

00:00:35.756 --> 00:00:40.396
that you have as you look
at each of those photos.

00:00:40.396 --> 00:00:43.116
&gt;&gt;Hae-Sin: Quality education is
a curriculum that pushes kids.

00:00:43.736 --> 00:00:46.636
It's not making them feel safe
or comfortable all the time.

00:00:46.636 --> 00:00:47.656
Or successful.

00:00:47.656 --> 00:00:49.416
It's supposed to be frustrating.

00:00:49.416 --> 00:00:50.876
It's supposed to make
kids really think.

00:00:50.876 --> 00:00:53.026
It's supposed to push them
out of their comfort zone.

00:00:53.026 --> 00:00:55.866
Give them new experiences,
ask questions,

00:00:56.006 --> 00:00:57.776
find answers to their questions.

00:00:57.776 --> 00:01:00.756
Understand that like life is not
an answer; life is a question.

00:01:00.756 --> 00:01:05.666
&gt;&gt;Keiko: I think that
some people would say

00:01:05.666 --> 00:01:07.806
that seventh graders shouldn't
be looking at these images,

00:01:07.806 --> 00:01:09.016
and that they're too young.

00:01:09.016 --> 00:01:11.946
And I don't agree with that.

00:01:12.046 --> 00:01:13.706
I think that you look
at the video games

00:01:13.756 --> 00:01:17.166
that our third graders are playing,
and they're just as graphic.

00:01:17.586 --> 00:01:21.136
The first day that I was here,
one of my brand-new students came

00:01:21.166 --> 00:01:22.656
into me during lunchtime
and he was like, "Keiko,

00:01:22.656 --> 00:01:25.536
have you ever seen
anybody get killed?"

00:01:25.796 --> 00:01:29.236
And I said, "Well, in fact, I
have seen somebody get shot."

00:01:29.626 --> 00:01:32.206
He was like, "Yeah, I've
seen 11 people get shot."

00:01:33.326 --> 00:01:37.086
And so our kids are really dealing

00:01:37.086 --> 00:01:41.106
with some very heavy
issues in their lives.

00:01:41.376 --> 00:01:44.226
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Heavy issues
like violence, overcrowding,

00:01:44.226 --> 00:01:47.106
low test scores, and
low expectations,

00:01:47.366 --> 00:01:49.586
led parents in this
East Oakland Community

00:01:49.656 --> 00:01:51.846
to demand something
better for their kids.

00:01:52.506 --> 00:01:54.376
&gt;&gt;Emma: This is about
their child's future.

00:01:54.726 --> 00:01:58.046
And we, the parents, need to learn
that we can make a difference just

00:01:58.626 --> 00:02:00.186
by getting involved at the school.

00:02:00.286 --> 00:02:03.126
So I think that's so important
for parents to understand that.

00:02:03.226 --> 00:02:05.436
We cannot let other
people decide for our kids.

00:02:07.246 --> 00:02:09.646
&gt;&gt;Narrator: With help from the
non-profit Oakland Community

00:02:09.646 --> 00:02:12.986
Organizations, a group of
parents lobbied the school board

00:02:12.986 --> 00:02:17.036
to create a new K through eighth
grade school for 200 students.

00:02:17.906 --> 00:02:21.626
One of five new schools to
open in the Fall of 2001,

00:02:21.626 --> 00:02:25.806
Ascend stands for "a school
cultivating excellence,

00:02:26.106 --> 00:02:27.336
nurturing diversity."

00:02:28.496 --> 00:02:31.976
&gt;&gt;Keiko: We're actually out to
reform the public school system.

00:02:32.126 --> 00:02:36.076
And I think that we have definitely
taken a step in the right direction.

00:02:36.716 --> 00:02:39.456
&gt;&gt;Narrator: One key to the
reformation effort is the concept

00:02:39.456 --> 00:02:41.056
of expeditionary learning.

00:02:41.426 --> 00:02:43.476
A teaching method that
encourages students

00:02:43.476 --> 00:02:45.786
to dig deeply into a single subject.

00:02:45.786 --> 00:02:48.686
&gt;&gt;Teacher: So that's not
absolutely set in stone.

00:02:49.546 --> 00:02:52.136
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Twice a year, students
work with their teachers to come

00:02:52.136 --> 00:02:55.306
up with a question or area of
inquiry that they will pursue

00:02:55.306 --> 00:02:56.676
for the next several months.

00:02:57.106 --> 00:03:00.626
They integrate math, science and
English studies, and with the help

00:03:00.626 --> 00:03:03.726
of local artists express
themselves in artwork,

00:03:04.206 --> 00:03:07.976
dance, video, drama and music.

00:03:08.516 --> 00:03:13.666
&gt;&gt;Students: [singing]

00:03:14.166 --> 00:03:17.106
&gt;&gt;Elena: At the end of our last
semester, which ended in January,

00:03:17.146 --> 00:03:22.816
I gave the students a survey
asking them what topics and themes

00:03:22.816 --> 00:03:24.726
in history they wanted
to study more about.

00:03:25.286 --> 00:03:29.766
And the results were that the
kids wanted to study about Islam.

00:03:29.856 --> 00:03:31.816
They wanted to study
about the Middle East.

00:03:32.426 --> 00:03:34.706
And they wanted to study about war.

00:03:34.846 --> 00:03:38.426
And in order to do that, the
kids immediately realized,

00:03:38.426 --> 00:03:39.506
"We need to hear multiple voices.

00:03:39.936 --> 00:03:41.226
And one of those voices we want

00:03:41.226 --> 00:03:43.616
to hear are Iraqi people,
and Iraqi children."

00:03:43.666 --> 00:03:46.406
And so we had email
pen-pals in Baghdad.

00:03:46.586 --> 00:03:50.256
&gt;&gt;Student: "My dear Mr. Louis,
We are people who love peace.

00:03:50.316 --> 00:03:51.716
We won't accept occupation.

00:03:51.986 --> 00:03:53.076
We say "no" to war.

00:03:53.076 --> 00:03:53.796
"Yes" to peace."

00:03:54.706 --> 00:03:57.436
&gt;&gt;Student: "Dear Joan, I was
so excited to hear from you.

00:03:57.676 --> 00:04:01.116
I really don't want this war
because it is pretty harmful."

00:04:01.786 --> 00:04:02.676
&gt;&gt;Student: "What do they want?

00:04:03.226 --> 00:04:05.426
Our oil? It's not theirs after all."

00:04:05.936 --> 00:04:07.496
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Hae-Sin: We're
about to march in there.

00:04:07.636 --> 00:04:11.746
They're doing this massive build-up,
and you sense the tension building,

00:04:11.936 --> 00:04:13.216
and we're getting it first-hand.

00:04:13.216 --> 00:04:14.966
I mean, this is a primary source.

00:04:15.386 --> 00:04:19.976
It's a brilliant way for these
children to learn about Iraq.

00:04:20.586 --> 00:04:22.736
&gt;&gt;Student: "Anyway, I
felt better when I knew

00:04:22.736 --> 00:04:24.506
that someone really
cares over there."

00:04:24.506 --> 00:04:29.196
&gt;&gt;President: "My fellow
citizens, this hour, American

00:04:29.196 --> 00:04:32.996
and Coalition forces in the early
stages of military operations

00:04:33.316 --> 00:04:35.806
to disarm Iraq, to free its people,

00:04:35.956 --> 00:04:41.356
and to defend the world
from grave danger."

00:04:41.356 --> 00:04:44.246
&gt;&gt;Elena: When the war started, right
away they started asking questions

00:04:44.326 --> 00:04:46.366
that were-- sort of
came out naturally.

00:04:46.856 --> 00:04:48.706
"Well, we're seeing
all this coverage,

00:04:48.736 --> 00:04:50.216
but where are the stories
about the children?

00:04:50.276 --> 00:04:51.056
What about our pen-pals?

00:04:51.256 --> 00:04:51.976
Are they okay?

00:04:52.096 --> 00:04:54.786
You know, these anonymous
lights in the sky,

00:04:54.786 --> 00:04:56.186
but what are those bombs hitting?

00:04:56.186 --> 00:04:57.166
Are they hitting my friend?"

00:05:00.676 --> 00:05:02.556
&gt;&gt;Reporter: They gathered at
Market and Powell this morning

00:05:02.556 --> 00:05:05.246
around 9:00 a.m., holding
pictures of Iraqi children.

00:05:05.516 --> 00:05:08.806
Today, they say their march was
about expressing their feelings,

00:05:08.806 --> 00:05:11.016
and it's not an anti-war march.

00:05:11.626 --> 00:05:13.406
&gt;&gt;Elena: It's not black and white
when you're talking with kids.

00:05:13.406 --> 00:05:14.466
They have complex emotions.

00:05:14.526 --> 00:05:15.286
They're confused.

00:05:15.506 --> 00:05:15.856
They're sad.

00:05:16.096 --> 00:05:16.936
They're frustrated.

00:05:16.936 --> 00:05:19.866
And they feel disempowered,
because they feel

00:05:19.866 --> 00:05:21.326
like people don't listen to children.

00:05:21.326 --> 00:05:24.426
And they are worried
about their friends.

00:05:24.506 --> 00:05:28.716
&gt;&gt;Sarita: I think that we
shouldn't have this war,

00:05:28.956 --> 00:05:34.096
because Iraq already is kind of poor,
in a way, and it's like 50 percent

00:05:34.096 --> 00:05:35.536
of the people there are children.

00:05:35.536 --> 00:05:38.716
So basically, more children are
getting bombed than the parents.

00:05:38.716 --> 00:05:39.716
&gt;&gt;Huber: The march was really cool,

00:05:39.716 --> 00:05:41.746
'cause it was silent,
just with the posters.

00:05:41.746 --> 00:05:45.546
And then this man came up to us
saying, "Get back to your country.

00:05:45.546 --> 00:05:47.076
Why are you over here marching?

00:05:47.076 --> 00:05:48.746
You're not even from this nation?"

00:05:49.206 --> 00:05:51.846
And I felt really bad, 'cause
this is actually my nation.

00:05:51.846 --> 00:05:54.856
And it made me feel like
intimidated, but then I believe

00:05:55.006 --> 00:05:58.606
like they're just saying that so
that young kids will feel scared

00:05:58.606 --> 00:06:02.336
and not come out and
speak out what they feel.

00:06:02.456 --> 00:06:05.356
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The seventh graders
peaceful protest caught the attention

00:06:05.356 --> 00:06:07.376
of news media around the world.

00:06:07.826 --> 00:06:10.646
From CNN to NBC's "Today Show."

00:06:11.266 --> 00:06:13.326
&gt;&gt;Reporter: Huber, are you
concerned about your friends?

00:06:14.286 --> 00:06:17.666
&gt;&gt;Huber: If they're
dead, it's really sad.

00:06:17.966 --> 00:06:19.936
So I don't know what to do.

00:06:19.936 --> 00:06:21.346
I feel really confused.

00:06:22.146 --> 00:06:24.986
&gt;&gt;Reporter: Carina, some of
the response was not positive

00:06:25.096 --> 00:06:27.096
for the anti-war protest.

00:06:27.096 --> 00:06:29.286
In fact, there were many
adults who said they felt

00:06:29.286 --> 00:06:32.216
like the students were being
used as pawns for the adults.

00:06:32.926 --> 00:06:35.146
Do you think that that's the case?

00:06:35.146 --> 00:06:39.056
How would you respond
to those people.

00:06:39.666 --> 00:06:40.996
&gt;&gt;Carina: Those people are wrong,

00:06:40.996 --> 00:06:43.676
because we all have
a mind of our own.

00:06:43.676 --> 00:06:46.336
If they want to believe that
our teacher was forcing us

00:06:46.366 --> 00:06:47.586
to do that, they didn't.

00:06:47.646 --> 00:06:51.486
Some students refused to go,
but I really wanted to go,

00:06:51.486 --> 00:06:53.476
because I really wanted
to get my voice out.

00:06:53.786 --> 00:06:57.346
&gt;&gt;Reporter: Well, Carina,
thank you for joining us.

00:06:57.346 --> 00:07:00.266
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Having become the
subject of media coverage themselves,

00:07:00.486 --> 00:07:02.526
the students gained new insights

00:07:02.526 --> 00:07:06.476
as they studied how the war was
being covered in print and on TV.

00:07:06.476 --> 00:07:08.466
&gt;&gt;Elena: I have a list
of questions here.

00:07:08.466 --> 00:07:10.926
Not all of them apply to every photo.

00:07:11.106 --> 00:07:13.746
But in this photo, who
do you identify with?

00:07:13.746 --> 00:07:16.226
And who do you feel empathy for?

00:07:16.486 --> 00:07:17.876
&gt;&gt;Student: The Iraqi civilian.

00:07:18.246 --> 00:07:19.266
&gt;&gt;Elena: The Iraqi civilian.

00:07:20.586 --> 00:07:25.246
What other kinds of things
do you think you might think?

00:07:26.056 --> 00:07:27.276
&gt;&gt;Student: Well, I realize this.

00:07:27.276 --> 00:07:31.066
It's like if you look at
this picture, you feel sorry

00:07:31.066 --> 00:07:34.066
for the soldiers, and that kind of
makes you want to support the war.

00:07:34.236 --> 00:07:37.756
But then if you look at this picture,
you feel sorry for the Iraqi people.

00:07:38.136 --> 00:07:40.466
And that makes you think
that the war isn't necessary.

00:07:41.291 --> 00:07:43.291
&gt;&gt;Parent: [speaks Spanish]

00:07:43.566 --> 00:07:44.856
&gt;&gt;Narrator: At the
end of the semester,

00:07:44.856 --> 00:07:47.816
the seventh graders held
an evening class Teach-In

00:07:48.066 --> 00:07:49.866
for their parents about the war.

00:07:50.516 --> 00:07:56.966
&gt;&gt;Student: [speaks Spanish]

00:07:57.466 --> 00:07:59.166
&gt;&gt;Narrator: For the
parents, it was a chance

00:07:59.166 --> 00:08:02.366
to discover how much their
children had learned about the war,

00:08:02.516 --> 00:08:04.976
and how to get new
information on the subject.

00:08:05.516 --> 00:08:09.716
&gt;&gt;Student: [speaks Chinese]

00:08:10.216 --> 00:08:12.396
&gt;&gt;Student: We'd been studying
this a really long time,

00:08:12.396 --> 00:08:15.196
and they don't have the
education like we have.

00:08:15.656 --> 00:08:17.346
They just learned a whole lot.

00:08:18.066 --> 00:08:20.156
&gt;&gt;Elena: Academically, we're starting

00:08:20.156 --> 00:08:23.096
to see what difference
these schools can make.

00:08:23.716 --> 00:08:26.776
Our Stanford 9 test scores just
came out across all the schools.

00:08:26.776 --> 00:08:30.736
And our school, as well as the other
small schools, showed dramatic gains.

00:08:30.906 --> 00:08:32.566
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The last stop

00:08:33.036 --> 00:08:37.086
on the seventh grade expedition
was Fantasy Studios in Berkeley,

00:08:37.086 --> 00:08:39.796
where the class recorded
a CD of peace songs,

00:08:40.306 --> 00:08:42.606
hoping to send the
proceeds from their sales

00:08:42.606 --> 00:08:43.946
to their pen-pals in Iraq.

00:08:44.516 --> 00:08:51.726
&gt;&gt;Class: [singing]

00:08:52.226 --> 00:08:55.576
&gt;&gt;Elena: In the beginning of the war,
we started working with our musician,

00:08:55.706 --> 00:08:58.046
Sarah, and singing songs of peace.

00:08:58.236 --> 00:09:01.396
And as we started singing them,
it was such a relief in the middle

00:09:01.396 --> 00:09:04.676
of all this misery to be able to
sing and create something beautiful,

00:09:04.676 --> 00:09:07.306
and express our feelings in that way.

00:09:07.306 --> 00:09:11.326
&gt;&gt;Hae-Sin: I think there's a
switch in all of us, you know.

00:09:11.326 --> 00:09:15.036
Something that turns you on to
suddenly not only like learning,

00:09:15.306 --> 00:09:17.446
but just your own thinking.

00:09:17.956 --> 00:09:20.546
I feel like our seventh graders
have become thinkers now.

00:09:21.276 --> 00:09:22.266
The switch is on.

00:09:22.266 --> 00:09:24.336
They're thinking of
themselves as change-makers.

00:09:24.336 --> 00:09:27.596
As people who have
voices, who have power,

00:09:27.636 --> 00:09:30.086
who can articulate,
who are respected.

00:09:30.726 --> 00:09:32.066
They just made this huge leap.

00:09:32.876 --> 00:09:37.136
Suddenly they are deep, critical,
reflective, powerful thinkers.

00:09:37.136 --> 00:09:45.576
And I think this curriculum
turned the switch on.

00:09:45.576 --> 00:09:48.816
&gt;&gt;Elena: I look at a few of my kids
and I say, "He would have dropped

00:09:48.816 --> 00:09:49.966
out in any other school by now.

00:09:50.066 --> 00:09:50.756
He would be out.

00:09:51.136 --> 00:09:54.526
This one would never be singing like
this in front of all his peers."

00:09:54.796 --> 00:09:57.796
They're learning stuff that they're
going to remember for their lives.

00:09:58.066 --> 00:09:59.826
They're so motivated.

00:09:59.916 --> 00:10:01.876
These kids are going
to go to college.

00:10:01.876 --> 00:10:02.826
That's why I'm a teacher.

00:10:02.826 --> 00:10:04.096
And I couldn't be a
teacher anywhere else,

00:10:04.096 --> 00:10:05.816
because it doesn't happen
like that elsewhere.

00:10:05.816 --> 00:10:08.926
You know, what I envisioned and
what I hoped would happen here,

00:10:08.926 --> 00:10:09.686
is happening.

00:10:09.686 --> 00:10:10.946
And it makes it all worth it.

00:10:11.516 --> 00:10:22.030
&gt;&gt;Class: [singing]
