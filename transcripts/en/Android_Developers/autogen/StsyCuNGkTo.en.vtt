of their terminals they had 30,000

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:41.659
of their terminals they had 30,000
 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:45.039
of their terminals they had 30,000
terminals and they wanted instant direct

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:45.049
terminals and they wanted instant direct
 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:47.590

messaging every terminal receives every

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600
messaging every terminal receives every
 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.539

message within a certain time frame and

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:49.549
message within a certain time frame and
 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:51.249
message within a certain time frame and
an average each terminal would issue

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:51.259
an average each terminal would issue
 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:53.709
an average each terminal would issue
about a hundred messages a day so can

00:01:53.709 --> 00:01:53.719
about a hundred messages a day so can
 

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:55.990
about a hundred messages a day so can
anybody do the math say for 30,000

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000
anybody do the math say for 30,000
 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.370
anybody do the math say for 30,000
terminals around the globe how many

terminals around the globe how many
 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.370
terminals around the globe how many
messages would that be it's a lot right

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380
messages would that be it's a lot right
 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.499
messages would that be it's a lot right
so if you think about you've 30,000

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:02.509
so if you think about you've 30,000
 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:04.719
so if you think about you've 30,000

floating around in this
them every day that's a lot of messages

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930
them every day that's a lot of messages
 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.410
them every day that's a lot of messages
that's a lot of scale now of course when

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420
that's a lot of scale now of course when
 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.350
that's a lot of scale now of course when
we brought it to the customers who were

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360
we brought it to the customers who were
 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.820
we brought it to the customers who were
saying that they wanted to build a

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830
saying that they wanted to build a
 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.530
saying that they wanted to build a
system this way we're saying you can't

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540
system this way we're saying you can't
 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.090
system this way we're saying you can't
just flood your network with messages

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100
just flood your network with messages
 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.650
just flood your network with messages
like that you got to design your system

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660
like that you got to design your system
 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.530
like that you got to design your system
in particular ways you keep closely

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540
in particular ways you keep closely
 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.570
in particular ways you keep closely
related messages close to each other so

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580
related messages close to each other so
 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.520
related messages close to each other so
take for example this customer had

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530
take for example this customer had
 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.650
take for example this customer had
branches in Singapore in London and in

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660
branches in Singapore in London and in
 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.840
branches in Singapore in London and in
New York and we were saying well you

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850
New York and we were saying well you
 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.210
New York and we were saying well you
know 99% of the messages in Singapore

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220
know 99% of the messages in Singapore
 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.190
know 99% of the messages in Singapore
the people in London don't care about

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200
the people in London don't care about
 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.840
the people in London don't care about
them in 99 percent of the messages in

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850
them in 99 percent of the messages in
 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:49.340
them in 99 percent of the messages in
London the people in Singapore don't

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350
London the people in Singapore don't
 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.290
London the people in Singapore don't
care about them so we started carefully

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300
care about them so we started carefully
 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.180
care about them so we started carefully
designing the network for these messages

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190
designing the network for these messages
 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.520
designing the network for these messages
so that you wouldn't completely flood

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530
so that you wouldn't completely flood
 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.830
so that you wouldn't completely flood
your network with messages an order of

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840
your network with messages an order of
 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.160
your network with messages an order of
ten to the nine every single day and so

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170
ten to the nine every single day and so
 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.050
ten to the nine every single day and so
we ended up we spent about six months

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060
we ended up we spent about six months
 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.310
we ended up we spent about six months
designing what this thing would look

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320
designing what this thing would look
 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.290
designing what this thing would look
like and then we brought it back to the

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300
like and then we brought it back to the
 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:07.820
like and then we brought it back to the
company and we brought it to their ops

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830
company and we brought it to their ops
 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.070
company and we brought it to their ops
people and there are people to look at

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080
people and there are people to look at
 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.650
people and there are people to look at
it and said nope not gonna happen you

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660
it and said nope not gonna happen you
 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.210
it and said nope not gonna happen you
know because even with all the design

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220
know because even with all the design
 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.310
know because even with all the design
work that was put into this the amount

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320
work that was put into this the amount
 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:17.660
work that was put into this the amount
of infrastructure that would be

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670
of infrastructure that would be
 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.580
of infrastructure that would be
necessary to be able to handle something

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590
necessary to be able to handle something
 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.740
necessary to be able to handle something
like this was just obscenely expensive

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750
like this was just obscenely expensive
 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.170
like this was just obscenely expensive
for them to build it was way ahead of

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180
for them to build it was way ahead of
 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.780
for them to build it was way ahead of
its time it was pre cloud and it just

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790

lines and then the sender ID is

00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:31.390
lines and then the sender ID is
 

00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:32.340
lines and then the sender ID is
something that's unique to your

00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:32.350
something that's unique to your
 

00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:33.990
something that's unique to your
application so maybe you have multiple

00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:34.000
application so maybe you have multiple
 

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.490
application so maybe you have multiple
applications that you're building and

a bundle with the data and the bundle

00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:25.570
a bundle with the data and the bundle
 

00:12:25.570 --> 00:12:27.420
a bundle with the data and the bundle
with the data it's gonna be a JSON

00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:27.430
with the data it's gonna be a JSON
 

00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:29.070
with the data it's gonna be a JSON
message with a lot of details about the

00:12:29.070 --> 00:12:29.080
message with a lot of details about the
 

00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:31.770
message with a lot of details about the
data but the the actual message that I'm

00:12:31.770 --> 00:12:31.780
data but the the actual message that I'm
 

00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:33.510
data but the the actual message that I'm
sending through my server the text

00:12:33.510 --> 00:12:33.520
sending through my server the text
 

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:35.579
sending through my server the text
message you know gets prefixed with an M

00:12:35.579 --> 00:12:35.589
message you know gets prefixed with an M
 

00:12:35.589 --> 00:12:36.870
message you know gets prefixed with an M
and that's why I have here string

00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:36.880
and that's why I have here string
 

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:39.000
and that's why I have here string
message equals data don't get string N

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:39.010
message equals data don't get string N
 

00:12:39.010 --> 00:12:40.710
message equals data don't get string N
and then out of that I'm just going to

00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:40.720
and then out of that I'm just going to
 

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:42.120
and then out of that I'm just going to
generate a notification you can do

00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:42.130
generate a notification you can do
 

00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:43.410
generate a notification you can do
whatever you like of course when you

00:12:43.410 --> 00:12:43.420
whatever you like of course when you
 

00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:44.790
whatever you like of course when you
receive an incoming message you can

00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:44.800
receive an incoming message you can
 

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:46.710
receive an incoming message you can
render it in one of your activities but

00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:46.720
render it in one of your activities but
 

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:48.510
render it in one of your activities but
for this demo I'm just generating a

00:12:48.510 --> 00:12:48.520
for this demo I'm just generating a
 

00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:50.340
for this demo I'm just generating a
notification in a notification tray with

00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:50.350
notification in a notification tray with
 

00:12:50.350 --> 00:12:53.790
notification in a notification tray with
the actual message okay so let's take a

00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:53.800
the actual message okay so let's take a
 

00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:54.930
the actual message okay so let's take a
look at what this would look like in

00:12:54.930 --> 00:12:54.940
look at what this would look like in
 

00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:57.810
look at what this would look like in
Android studio okay well that's what the

00:12:57.810 --> 00:12:57.820
Android studio okay well that's what the
 

00:12:57.820 --> 00:13:00.030
Android studio okay well that's what the
application looks like with my beautiful

00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:00.040
application looks like with my beautiful
 

00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:01.829
application looks like with my beautiful
design and not known for my design

00:13:01.829 --> 00:13:01.839

and on Google Cloud messaging this

00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:55.730
and on Google Cloud messaging this
 

00:14:55.730 --> 00:14:58.300
and on Google Cloud messaging this
number here was the the sender ID that I

00:14:58.300 --> 00:14:58.310
number here was the the sender ID that I
 

00:14:58.310 --> 00:15:00.430

then I'm posting that up to my server so

00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:46.160
then I'm posting that up to my server so
 

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:48.190
then I'm posting that up to my server so
my server will get that registration ID

00:15:48.190 --> 00:15:48.200
my server will get that registration ID
 

00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:50.139
my server will get that registration ID
so then whenever I want to try and send

00:15:50.139 --> 00:15:50.149
so then whenever I want to try and send
 

00:15:50.149 --> 00:15:51.970
so then whenever I want to try and send
messages to any of my clients it has

00:15:51.970 --> 00:15:51.980
messages to any of my clients it has
 

00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:53.980
messages to any of my clients it has
that registration ID and it will send it

00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:53.990
that registration ID and it will send it
 

00:15:53.990 --> 00:15:55.449
that registration ID and it will send it
down to the client that I'm executing

00:15:55.449 --> 00:15:55.459
down to the client that I'm executing
 

00:15:55.459 --> 00:15:59.350

message out of that as a string and I'm
 

00:16:44.569 --> 00:16:46.480
message out of that as a string and I'm
sending a notification and then this

00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:46.490
sending a notification and then this
 

00:16:46.490 --> 00:16:47.859
sending a notification and then this
code here if you've ever built a

00:16:47.859 --> 00:16:47.869
code here if you've ever built a
 

00:16:47.869 --> 00:16:49.329
code here if you've ever built a
notification in Android will look very

00:16:49.329 --> 00:16:49.339
notification in Android will look very
 

00:16:49.339 --> 00:16:50.049
notification in Android will look very
familiar

00:16:50.049 --> 00:16:50.059
familiar
 

00:16:50.059 --> 00:16:51.639

I'm just using a notification compat

00:16:51.639 --> 00:16:51.649
I'm just using a notification compat

notification is nothing to do with
Google Cloud messaging this is just

00:16:56.980 --> 00:16:56.990
Google Cloud messaging this is just
 

00:16:56.990 --> 00:16:58.749
Google Cloud messaging this is just
taking that string that was received

00:16:58.749 --> 00:16:58.759
taking that string that was received
 

00:16:58.759 --> 00:17:00.910
taking that string that was received
from the Google Cloud messaging server

00:17:00.910 --> 00:17:00.920
from the Google Cloud messaging server
 

00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:02.949
from the Google Cloud messaging server
and turning it into a notification it's

00:17:02.949 --> 00:17:02.959
and turning it into a notification it's
 

00:17:02.959 --> 00:17:04.120
and turning it into a notification it's
straightforward it's pretty standard

00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:04.130
straightforward it's pretty standard
 

00:17:04.130 --> 00:17:08.590
straightforward it's pretty standard
code all right so when I run this I will

and then you've probably heard of a tool

00:17:37.810 --> 00:17:37.820
and then you've probably heard of a tool
 

00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:40.870
and then you've probably heard of a tool
called my PHP admin all right so my PHP

00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:40.880
called my PHP admin all right so my PHP
 

00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:43.090

here was I earlier just while you guys

00:17:53.950 --> 00:17:53.960
here was I earlier just while you guys
 

00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:55.360
here was I earlier just while you guys
were in the keynote I ran this

00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:55.370
were in the keynote I ran this
 

00:17:55.370 --> 00:17:57.100
were in the keynote I ran this
application in the emulator around this

00:17:57.100 --> 00:17:57.110
application in the emulator around this
 

00:17:57.110 --> 00:17:59.260
application in the emulator around this
application on my phone and I did I hit

00:17:59.260 --> 00:17:59.270
application on my phone and I did I hit
 

00:17:59.270 --> 00:18:00.610
application on my phone and I did I hit
that register button in order to

00:18:00.610 --> 00:18:00.620
that register button in order to
 

00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:03.070
that register button in order to
generate its open and register it and as

00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:03.080
generate its open and register it and as
 

00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:05.019
generate its open and register it and as
a result I got these two records in my

reals I'm going to delete them so I'll

00:18:23.710 --> 00:18:23.720
reals I'm going to delete them so I'll
 

00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:25.930
reals I'm going to delete them so I'll
come in here and in PHP admin I can

00:18:25.930 --> 00:18:25.940
come in here and in PHP admin I can
 

00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:31.320
come in here and in PHP admin I can
delete them and that'll take a moment

00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:31.330
 
 

00:18:31.330 --> 00:18:33.659

and if I go back to my site and I'll
 

00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:37.630
and if I go back to my site and I'll
talk about how to build a site like this

00:18:37.630 --> 00:18:37.640
talk about how to build a site like this
 

00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:40.000
talk about how to build a site like this
in a moment we should see after a

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:40.010
in a moment we should see after a
 

00:18:40.010 --> 00:18:41.320
in a moment we should see after a
refresh okay there are no devices

00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:41.330
refresh okay there are no devices
 

00:18:41.330 --> 00:18:44.019

and I'll just say hello workroom again

00:18:47.830 --> 00:18:47.840
and I'll just say hello workroom again
 

00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:49.660
and I'll just say hello workroom again
something like that so we see it's

00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:49.670
something like that so we see it's
 

00:18:49.670 --> 00:18:50.290
something like that so we see it's
something different

00:18:50.290 --> 00:18:50.300
something different
 

00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:52.570
something different
I'll hit register it's a really poorly

00:18:52.570 --> 00:18:52.580
I'll hit register it's a really poorly
 

00:18:52.580 --> 00:18:54.250
I'll hit register it's a really poorly
designed application I don't have a you

00:18:54.250 --> 00:18:54.260

that in the register so it'll take a

00:18:56.890 --> 00:18:56.900
that in the register so it'll take a
 

00:18:56.900 --> 00:18:58.930
that in the register so it'll take a
moment to register I'll come back and

00:18:58.930 --> 00:18:58.940
moment to register I'll come back and
 

00:18:58.940 --> 00:19:01.990
moment to register I'll come back and
I'll refresh the site and we should see

00:19:01.990 --> 00:19:02.000
I'll refresh the site and we should see
 

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.590
I'll refresh the site and we should see
in a moment like I said this is a free

00:19:05.590 --> 00:19:05.600

hitting Wi-Fi at the same time so it's

00:19:25.930 --> 00:19:25.940
hitting Wi-Fi at the same time so it's
 

00:19:25.940 --> 00:19:31.690
hitting Wi-Fi at the same time so it's
still waiting nope okay isn't it always

00:19:31.690 --> 00:19:31.700

00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:33.760
still waiting nope okay isn't it always
like that when you try to run a demo

00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:33.770
like that when you try to run a demo
 

00:19:33.770 --> 00:19:38.020

alrighty so we can talk a little bit

00:20:17.019 --> 00:20:17.029
alrighty so we can talk a little bit
 

00:20:17.029 --> 00:20:18.490
alrighty so we can talk a little bit
about the app server and then I'll see

00:20:18.490 --> 00:20:18.500
about the app server and then I'll see
 

00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:22.840
about the app server and then I'll see
if the demo is behaving after that so

00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:22.850
if the demo is behaving after that so
 

00:20:22.850 --> 00:20:25.090
if the demo is behaving after that so
earlier we saw this was how I built the

00:20:25.090 --> 00:20:25.100
earlier we saw this was how I built the
 

00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:26.259
earlier we saw this was how I built the
Android app which isn't working right

00:20:26.259 --> 00:20:26.269
Android app which isn't working right
 

00:20:26.269 --> 00:20:28.720
Android app which isn't working right
now but how I built the Android app was

00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:28.730
now but how I built the Android app was
 

00:20:28.730 --> 00:20:30.249
now but how I built the Android app was
just very straightforward it was a

00:20:30.249 --> 00:20:30.259
just very straightforward it was a
 

00:20:30.259 --> 00:20:31.779
just very straightforward it was a
single activity there were a couple of

00:20:31.779 --> 00:20:31.789
single activity there were a couple of
 

00:20:31.789 --> 00:20:33.460
single activity there were a couple of
text fields there was a register button

00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:33.470
text fields there was a register button
 

00:20:33.470 --> 00:20:35.830
text fields there was a register button
on that when I registered I called GCMs

00:20:35.830 --> 00:20:35.840
on that when I registered I called GCMs
 

00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:37.119
on that when I registered I called GCMs
black box in order to get that

00:20:37.119 --> 00:20:37.129
black box in order to get that
 

00:20:37.129 --> 00:20:39.190
black box in order to get that
registration token back I had a couple

00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:39.200
registration token back I had a couple
 

00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:40.930
registration token back I had a couple
of them that which I deleted before the

00:20:40.930 --> 00:20:40.940
of them that which I deleted before the
 

00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:43.990
of them that which I deleted before the
demo fail and those registration tokens

00:20:43.990 --> 00:20:44.000
demo fail and those registration tokens
 

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:45.730
demo fail and those registration tokens
would then be captured by my back-end

00:20:45.730 --> 00:20:45.740
would then be captured by my back-end
 

00:20:45.740 --> 00:20:48.460
would then be captured by my back-end
server and stored by my back-end server

00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:48.470
server and stored by my back-end server
 

00:20:48.470 --> 00:20:50.230
server and stored by my back-end server
and then used by my back-end server if I

00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:50.240
and then used by my back-end server if I
 

00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:53.169
and then used by my back-end server if I
want to talk to individual devices or I

00:20:53.169 --> 00:20:53.179
want to talk to individual devices or I
 

00:20:53.179 --> 00:20:54.639
want to talk to individual devices or I
could take all of them if I want to talk

00:20:54.639 --> 00:20:54.649
could take all of them if I want to talk
 

00:20:54.649 --> 00:20:56.680
could take all of them if I want to talk
to all of my devices so how do we build

00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:56.690
to all of my devices so how do we build
 

00:20:56.690 --> 00:20:58.119
to all of my devices so how do we build
an app server what does this thing look

00:20:58.119 --> 00:20:58.129
an app server what does this thing look
 

00:20:58.129 --> 00:20:59.409
an app server what does this thing look
like well first of all there's a

00:20:59.409 --> 00:20:59.419
like well first of all there's a
 

00:20:59.419 --> 00:21:01.240
like well first of all there's a
database in it and I gave a sneak peek

00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:01.250
database in it and I gave a sneak peek
 

00:21:01.250 --> 00:21:03.850
database in it and I gave a sneak peek
of that a moment ago on us using the my

00:21:03.850 --> 00:21:03.860
of that a moment ago on us using the my
 

00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:06.399
of that a moment ago on us using the my
PHP admin so in this case very simple my

00:21:06.399 --> 00:21:06.409
PHP admin so in this case very simple my
 

00:21:06.409 --> 00:21:08.200
PHP admin so in this case very simple my
sequel back-end database it's storing

00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:08.210
sequel back-end database it's storing
 

00:21:08.210 --> 00:21:10.210
sequel back-end database it's storing
the registration tokens and it's storing

00:21:10.210 --> 00:21:10.220
the registration tokens and it's storing
 

00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:12.220
the registration tokens and it's storing
just the name and ID that I had I have a

00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:12.230
just the name and ID that I had I have a
 

00:21:12.230 --> 00:21:14.049
just the name and ID that I had I have a
UI for sending messages you saw that

00:21:14.049 --> 00:21:14.059
UI for sending messages you saw that
 

00:21:14.059 --> 00:21:16.509
UI for sending messages you saw that
basic UI is just a simple HTML UI and

00:21:16.509 --> 00:21:16.519
basic UI is just a simple HTML UI and
 

00:21:16.519 --> 00:21:18.639
basic UI is just a simple HTML UI and
then there's the interface to Google

00:21:18.639 --> 00:21:18.649
then there's the interface to Google
 

00:21:18.649 --> 00:21:20.950
then there's the interface to Google
Cloud messaging itself that requests the

00:21:20.950 --> 00:21:20.960
Cloud messaging itself that requests the
 

00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:23.919
Cloud messaging itself that requests the
messages to be routed either to one

00:21:23.919 --> 00:21:23.929
messages to be routed either to one
 

00:21:23.929 --> 00:21:26.139

device or multiple devices based on

00:21:26.139 --> 00:21:26.149
device or multiple devices based on
 

00:21:26.149 --> 00:21:28.299
device or multiple devices based on
those registration IDs that had come out

00:21:28.299 --> 00:21:28.309
those registration IDs that had come out
 

00:21:28.309 --> 00:21:30.879
those registration IDs that had come out
of the devices and this is were like

00:21:30.879 --> 00:21:30.889
of the devices and this is were like
 

00:21:30.889 --> 00:21:32.680
of the devices and this is were like
pretty much what it would look like in

00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:32.690
pretty much what it would look like in
 

00:21:32.690 --> 00:21:34.930
pretty much what it would look like in
this this application that I was showing

00:21:34.930 --> 00:21:34.940
this this application that I was showing
 

00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:36.879
this this application that I was showing
a moment ago would look like this so my

00:21:36.879 --> 00:21:36.889
a moment ago would look like this so my
 

00:21:36.889 --> 00:21:40.659
a moment ago would look like this so my
Android would call register dot PHP pass

00:21:40.659 --> 00:21:40.669
Android would call register dot PHP pass
 

00:21:40.669 --> 00:21:42.820
Android would call register dot PHP pass
it the three things the name the the

it the three things the name the the
 

00:21:42.830 --> 00:21:45.549
it the three things the name the the
email address and the registration token

00:21:45.549 --> 00:21:45.559
email address and the registration token
 

00:21:45.559 --> 00:21:47.950
email address and the registration token
and register dot PHP would then just

00:21:47.950 --> 00:21:47.960
and register dot PHP would then just
 

00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:50.860
and register dot PHP would then just
store them in the database then the user

00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:50.870
store them in the database then the user
 

00:21:50.870 --> 00:21:52.600
store them in the database then the user

example of this is where the
 

00:22:33.590 --> 00:22:36.250
example of this is where the
registration would look like so if

00:22:36.250 --> 00:22:36.260
registration would look like so if
 

00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:38.470
registration would look like so if
you've ever seen PHP this is PHP zero

00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:38.480
you've ever seen PHP this is PHP zero
 

00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:40.720
you've ever seen PHP this is PHP zero
zero one right it's I'm taking a look at

00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:40.730
zero one right it's I'm taking a look at
 

00:22:40.730 --> 00:22:42.310
zero one right it's I'm taking a look at
the posts for the name I'm taking up the

post of the email and I'm taking a look
 

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:45.430
post of the email and I'm taking a look
at the post for the register ID I'm

00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:45.440
at the post for the register ID I'm
 

00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:48.250
at the post for the register ID I'm
taking them and I'm using a just my

00:22:48.250 --> 00:22:48.260
taking them and I'm using a just my
 

00:22:48.260 --> 00:22:49.930
taking them and I'm using a just my
sequel query to store them in the

00:22:49.930 --> 00:22:49.940
sequel query to store them in the
 

00:22:49.940 --> 00:22:51.700
sequel query to store them in the
database I have a couple of things here

they call the my sequel admin stuff so
 

00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:01.780
they call the my sequel admin stuff so
that I can actually just call DB store

and it's just about getting those
registration IDs and if you know what

00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:22.910
registration IDs and if you know what
 

00:24:22.910 --> 00:24:24.490
registration IDs and if you know what
those registration IDs are that you want

you stick them into the array you
 

00:24:28.630 --> 00:24:30.920
you stick them into the array you
encoded in JSON and then you Carly

00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:30.930
encoded in JSON and then you Carly

like that alrighty so let's look at the

00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:34.050
like that alrighty so let's look at the
 

00:24:34.050 --> 00:24:35.990
like that alrighty so let's look at the
code for the app server and then I'll

00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:36.000
code for the app server and then I'll
 

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:37.400
code for the app server and then I'll
come back and try and get the demo to

00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:37.410
come back and try and get the demo to
 

00:24:37.410 --> 00:24:38.320
come back and try and get the demo to
work

00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:38.330
work
 

00:24:38.330 --> 00:24:51.110

anybody use coda it's a great editor I

00:24:57.500 --> 00:24:57.510
anybody use coda it's a great editor I
 

00:24:57.510 --> 00:24:59.480
anybody use coda it's a great editor I
love it so I'm just showing the code

00:24:59.480 --> 00:24:59.490
love it so I'm just showing the code
 

00:24:59.490 --> 00:25:02.299
love it so I'm just showing the code
here in coda let me see if I can make

00:25:02.299 --> 00:25:02.309
here in coda let me see if I can make
 

00:25:02.309 --> 00:25:16.980
here in coda let me see if I can make
the font a little bigger

00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:16.990
 
 

00:25:16.990 --> 00:25:20.040
 
all right does that look clearer all

a little bit let me see if I can get rid
 

00:25:34.210 --> 00:25:36.360
a little bit let me see if I can get rid
of that corruption no weird okay so

00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:36.370
of that corruption no weird okay so
 

00:25:36.370 --> 00:25:39.180
of that corruption no weird okay so
again for registering PHP 101 I'm taking

00:25:39.180 --> 00:25:39.190
again for registering PHP 101 I'm taking
 

00:25:39.190 --> 00:25:40.620
again for registering PHP 101 I'm taking
a look at the post and pulling in the

00:25:40.620 --> 00:25:40.630
a look at the post and pulling in the
 

00:25:40.630 --> 00:25:42.540
a look at the post and pulling in the
data from the post and then I'm storing

00:25:42.540 --> 00:25:42.550
data from the post and then I'm storing
 

00:25:42.550 --> 00:25:43.980

database functions that I created and we
 

00:25:46.330 --> 00:25:48.810
database functions that I created and we
can see what they look like you know to

00:25:48.810 --> 00:25:48.820
can see what they look like you know to
 

00:25:48.820 --> 00:25:51.600

table the name the email and the
 

00:26:15.010 --> 00:26:17.280
table the name the email and the
registration ID for that user and then

00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:17.290
registration ID for that user and then
 

00:26:17.290 --> 00:26:18.690
registration ID for that user and then
if I ever want to get them back it's

00:26:18.690 --> 00:26:18.700
if I ever want to get them back it's
 

00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:20.220
if I ever want to get them back it's
just the same kind of thing in my sequel

00:26:20.220 --> 00:26:20.230
just the same kind of thing in my sequel
 

00:26:20.230 --> 00:26:22.799
just the same kind of thing in my sequel
query to get them out the user interface

00:26:22.799 --> 00:26:22.809
query to get them out the user interface
 

00:26:22.809 --> 00:26:27.660
query to get them out the user interface
for for the for the app itself is

indexed up PHP if I come down to the
 

00:26:31.420 --> 00:26:35.580
indexed up PHP if I come down to the
index that PHP for seconds and you'll

00:26:35.580 --> 00:26:35.590
index that PHP for seconds and you'll
 

00:26:35.590 --> 00:26:37.710
index that PHP for seconds and you'll
just see I'm querying that database so

00:26:37.710 --> 00:26:37.720
just see I'm querying that database so
 

00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:40.049
just see I'm querying that database so
yeah I'm just clearing my database I

00:26:40.049 --> 00:26:40.059
yeah I'm just clearing my database I
 

00:26:40.059 --> 00:26:43.530
yeah I'm just clearing my database I
have a DB do get all users and then I'm

00:26:43.530 --> 00:26:43.540
have a DB do get all users and then I'm
 

00:26:43.540 --> 00:26:45.750
have a DB do get all users and then I'm
going to loop through and just generate

00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:45.760
going to loop through and just generate
 

00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:48.600
going to loop through and just generate
HTML forms one for each user and then

00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:48.610
HTML forms one for each user and then
 

00:26:48.610 --> 00:26:50.730
HTML forms one for each user and then
one for all of these users and then

00:26:50.730 --> 00:26:50.740
one for all of these users and then
 

00:26:50.740 --> 00:26:54.330
one for all of these users and then
those HTML forms as we can see here

00:26:54.330 --> 00:26:54.340
those HTML forms as we can see here
 

00:26:54.340 --> 00:26:56.490
those HTML forms as we can see here
they're gonna when I submit them they're

00:26:56.490 --> 00:26:56.500
they're gonna when I submit them they're
 

00:26:56.500 --> 00:26:59.400
they're gonna when I submit them they're
just gonna call the send PHP that I

00:26:59.400 --> 00:26:59.410
just gonna call the send PHP that I
 

00:26:59.410 --> 00:27:01.380
just gonna call the send PHP that I
spoke about earlier on where I put the

00:27:01.380 --> 00:27:01.390
spoke about earlier on where I put the
 

00:27:01.390 --> 00:27:03.090
spoke about earlier on where I put the
message into it and I put the list of

00:27:03.090 --> 00:27:03.100
message into it and I put the list of
 

00:27:03.100 --> 00:27:04.710
message into it and I put the list of
all the registration IDs that I want to

00:27:04.710 --> 00:27:04.720
all the registration IDs that I want to
 

00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:07.950
all the registration IDs that I want to
have in there in it and if I go back to

00:27:07.950 --> 00:27:07.960
have in there in it and if I go back to
 

00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:12.660
have in there in it and if I go back to
my browser for a second what that looks

00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:12.670
my browser for a second what that looks
 

00:27:12.670 --> 00:27:15.870
my browser for a second what that looks
like was this one so let's see if that

00:27:15.870 --> 00:27:15.880
like was this one so let's see if that
 

00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:19.140
like was this one so let's see if that
user got registered yet no oh there it

00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:19.150
user got registered yet no oh there it
 

00:27:19.150 --> 00:27:21.870
user got registered yet no oh there it
is okay so it finally came up so that

00:27:21.870 --> 00:27:21.880
is okay so it finally came up so that
 

00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:23.460
is okay so it finally came up so that
when I was running on my emulator you

00:27:23.460 --> 00:27:23.470
when I was running on my emulator you
 

00:27:23.470 --> 00:27:25.169
when I was running on my emulator you
see now this box that appeared was for

00:27:25.169 --> 00:27:25.179
see now this box that appeared was for
 

00:27:25.179 --> 00:27:28.169
see now this box that appeared was for
that user if I I'll rerun it on my phone

00:27:28.169 --> 00:27:28.179
that user if I I'll rerun it on my phone
 

00:27:28.179 --> 00:27:29.490
that user if I I'll rerun it on my phone
in a moment so we can see what it would

00:27:29.490 --> 00:27:29.500
in a moment so we can see what it would
 

00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:30.419
in a moment so we can see what it would
look like but

00:27:30.419 --> 00:27:30.429
look like but
 

00:27:30.429 --> 00:27:32.220
look like but
now I have one user in the database so I

00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:32.230
now I have one user in the database so I
 

00:27:32.230 --> 00:27:35.159
now I have one user in the database so I
have one GCM token in the database which

00:27:35.159 --> 00:27:35.169
have one GCM token in the database which
 

00:27:35.169 --> 00:27:37.139
have one GCM token in the database which
is for this user and if I type a message

00:27:37.139 --> 00:27:37.149
is for this user and if I type a message
 

00:27:37.149 --> 00:27:43.489
is for this user and if I type a message
in here say like hello room and send it

00:27:43.489 --> 00:27:43.499
 
 

00:27:43.499 --> 00:27:45.570
 
hopefully it'll show up in the emulator

00:27:45.570 --> 00:27:45.580
hopefully it'll show up in the emulator
 

00:27:45.580 --> 00:27:46.950
hopefully it'll show up in the emulator
there it goes and you see the

00:27:46.950 --> 00:27:46.960
there it goes and you see the
 

00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:48.330
there it goes and you see the
notification just appeared in the

00:27:48.330 --> 00:27:48.340
notification just appeared in the
 

00:27:48.340 --> 00:27:50.850
notification just appeared in the
emulator and when I drag it down we can

00:27:50.850 --> 00:27:50.860
emulator and when I drag it down we can
 

00:27:50.860 --> 00:27:53.100
emulator and when I drag it down we can
see that you see a message hello room so

00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:53.110
see that you see a message hello room so
 

00:27:53.110 --> 00:27:54.899
see that you see a message hello room so
if anybody wants to send a message to me

00:27:54.899 --> 00:27:54.909
if anybody wants to send a message to me
 

00:27:54.909 --> 00:27:57.509
if anybody wants to send a message to me
keep it clean

00:27:57.509 --> 00:27:57.519
keep it clean
 

00:27:57.519 --> 00:27:58.950
keep it clean
you can actually see the URL there this

00:27:58.950 --> 00:27:58.960
you can actually see the URL there this
 

00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:00.269
you can actually see the URL there this
is running like this app server is

00:28:00.269 --> 00:28:00.279
is running like this app server is
 

00:28:00.279 --> 00:28:01.950
is running like this app server is
running live on the Internet and like

00:28:01.950 --> 00:28:01.960
running live on the Internet and like
 

00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:04.379
running live on the Internet and like
right now I also have here just say you

00:28:04.379 --> 00:28:04.389
right now I also have here just say you
 

00:28:04.389 --> 00:28:08.039
right now I also have here just say you
know please keep it clean on this one

00:28:08.039 --> 00:28:08.049
know please keep it clean on this one
 

00:28:08.049 --> 00:28:09.389
know please keep it clean on this one
and this is just the center all

00:28:09.389 --> 00:28:09.399
and this is just the center all
 

00:28:09.399 --> 00:28:11.879
and this is just the center all
registered devices and I don't if you

00:28:11.879 --> 00:28:11.889
registered devices and I don't if you
 

00:28:11.889 --> 00:28:13.139
registered devices and I don't if you
can actually hear it and there's the

00:28:13.139 --> 00:28:13.149
can actually hear it and there's the
 

00:28:13.149 --> 00:28:14.850
can actually hear it and there's the
message actually appearing and you can

00:28:14.850 --> 00:28:14.860
message actually appearing and you can
 

00:28:14.860 --> 00:28:16.440
message actually appearing and you can
see how quick that was as soon as I had

00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:16.450
see how quick that was as soon as I had
 

00:28:16.450 --> 00:28:18.359
see how quick that was as soon as I had
typed it and that's going to my emulator

00:28:18.359 --> 00:28:18.369
typed it and that's going to my emulator
 

00:28:18.369 --> 00:28:21.269
typed it and that's going to my emulator
right so the emulator is receiving that

00:28:21.269 --> 00:28:21.279
right so the emulator is receiving that
 

00:28:21.279 --> 00:28:23.249
right so the emulator is receiving that
message from GCM and actually rendering

00:28:23.249 --> 00:28:23.259
message from GCM and actually rendering
 

00:28:23.259 --> 00:28:27.230
message from GCM and actually rendering
it in there okay

00:28:27.230 --> 00:28:27.240
 
 

00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:32.399
 
so any questions on the PHP part is it

00:28:32.399 --> 00:28:32.409
so any questions on the PHP part is it
 

00:28:32.409 --> 00:28:38.730
so any questions on the PHP part is it
clear clear as mud all right so that's

00:28:38.730 --> 00:28:38.740
clear clear as mud all right so that's
 

00:28:38.740 --> 00:28:41.820
clear clear as mud all right so that's
what a very very simple app server would

00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:41.830
what a very very simple app server would
 

00:28:41.830 --> 00:28:44.159
what a very very simple app server would
look like this really there's several

00:28:44.159 --> 00:28:44.169
look like this really there's several
 

00:28:44.169 --> 00:28:45.419
look like this really there's several
things that it needs to do first of all

00:28:45.419 --> 00:28:45.429
things that it needs to do first of all
 

00:28:45.429 --> 00:28:48.060
things that it needs to do first of all
you need to camp and it just I heard the

00:28:48.060 --> 00:28:48.070
you need to camp and it just I heard the
 

00:28:48.070 --> 00:28:49.590
you need to camp and it just I heard the
sounds did somebody just send something

00:28:49.590 --> 00:28:49.600
sounds did somebody just send something
 

00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:52.970
sounds did somebody just send something
I just heard the sound of a notification

00:28:52.970 --> 00:28:52.980
I just heard the sound of a notification
 

00:28:52.980 --> 00:28:56.600
I just heard the sound of a notification
yep we got a smiley face up there

00:28:56.600 --> 00:28:56.610
yep we got a smiley face up there
 

00:28:56.610 --> 00:28:58.919
yep we got a smiley face up there
so there's several things that it needs

00:28:58.919 --> 00:28:58.929
so there's several things that it needs
 

00:28:58.929 --> 00:29:02.310
so there's several things that it needs
to do so first of all when your Android

00:29:02.310 --> 00:29:02.320
to do so first of all when your Android
 

00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:04.529
to do so first of all when your Android
application has I need to turn off my

00:29:04.529 --> 00:29:04.539
application has I need to turn off my
 

00:29:04.539 --> 00:29:06.720
application has I need to turn off my
sound messages are all popping in there

00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:06.730
sound messages are all popping in there
 

00:29:06.730 --> 00:29:10.859
sound messages are all popping in there
and it's like so when your Android

00:29:10.859 --> 00:29:10.869
and it's like so when your Android
 

00:29:10.869 --> 00:29:12.659
and it's like so when your Android
application registers with Google Cloud

00:29:12.659 --> 00:29:12.669
application registers with Google Cloud
 

00:29:12.669 --> 00:29:15.629
application registers with Google Cloud
messaging you will get a token you need

00:29:15.629 --> 00:29:15.639
messaging you will get a token you need
 

00:29:15.639 --> 00:29:17.609
messaging you will get a token you need
to if from Google Cloud messaging

00:29:17.609 --> 00:29:17.619
to if from Google Cloud messaging
 

00:29:17.619 --> 00:29:19.889
to if from Google Cloud messaging
doesn't have any intelligence about

00:29:19.889 --> 00:29:19.899
doesn't have any intelligence about
 

00:29:19.899 --> 00:29:22.080
doesn't have any intelligence about
sending the messages for you it's just a

00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:22.090
sending the messages for you it's just a
 

00:29:22.090 --> 00:29:24.090
sending the messages for you it's just a
black box and you call that black box

00:29:24.090 --> 00:29:24.100
black box and you call that black box
 

00:29:24.100 --> 00:29:26.730
black box and you call that black box
and tell it to send messages to devices

00:29:26.730 --> 00:29:26.740
and tell it to send messages to devices
 

00:29:26.740 --> 00:29:28.710
and tell it to send messages to devices
on your behalf that token is the

00:29:28.710 --> 00:29:28.720
on your behalf that token is the
 

00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:30.600
on your behalf that token is the
identifier for it so when your app

00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:30.610
identifier for it so when your app
 

00:29:30.610 --> 00:29:33.269
identifier for it so when your app
server you need to store that token now

00:29:33.269 --> 00:29:33.279
server you need to store that token now
 

00:29:33.279 --> 00:29:34.859
server you need to store that token now
there's many there's a million different

00:29:34.859 --> 00:29:34.869
there's many there's a million different
 

00:29:34.869 --> 00:29:35.970
there's many there's a million different
ways you could have done it I just

00:29:35.970 --> 00:29:35.980
ways you could have done it I just
 

00:29:35.980 --> 00:29:38.310
ways you could have done it I just
decided to use this free public PHP

00:29:38.310 --> 00:29:38.320
decided to use this free public PHP
 

00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:41.279
decided to use this free public PHP
server to do it store the token in my

00:29:41.279 --> 00:29:41.289
server to do it store the token in my
 

00:29:41.289 --> 00:29:42.989
server to do it store the token in my
sequel database you could add a lot more

00:29:42.989 --> 00:29:42.999
sequel database you could add a lot more
 

00:29:42.999 --> 00:29:44.250
sequel database you could add a lot more
intelligence to that you get

00:29:44.250 --> 00:29:44.260
intelligence to that you get
 

00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:46.710
intelligence to that you get
for example people from Singapore have a

00:29:46.710 --> 00:29:46.720
for example people from Singapore have a
 

00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:48.570
for example people from Singapore have a
column in the database to identify that

00:29:48.570 --> 00:29:48.580
column in the database to identify that
 

00:29:48.580 --> 00:29:50.370
column in the database to identify that
from Singapore and people from London if

00:29:50.370 --> 00:29:50.380
from Singapore and people from London if
 

00:29:50.380 --> 00:29:51.750
from Singapore and people from London if
you came in late I was talking about an

00:29:51.750 --> 00:29:51.760
you came in late I was talking about an
 

00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:53.220
you came in late I was talking about an
example of an application that ran in

00:29:53.220 --> 00:29:53.230
example of an application that ran in
 

00:29:53.230 --> 00:29:54.600
example of an application that ran in

you would build it it's up to you how
 

00:30:00.580 --> 00:30:01.920
you would build it it's up to you how
you would design it it's up to you how

you would design it it's up to you how
 

00:30:01.930 --> 00:30:03.330
you would design it it's up to you how
you would filter out your messages and

00:30:03.330 --> 00:30:03.340
you would filter out your messages and
 

00:30:03.340 --> 00:30:05.610
you would filter out your messages and
how you would have users work in peer

00:30:05.610 --> 00:30:05.620
how you would have users work in peer

Google Cloud messaging which I'll talk

00:30:10.530 --> 00:30:10.540
Google Cloud messaging which I'll talk
 

00:30:10.540 --> 00:30:12.330
Google Cloud messaging which I'll talk
about in a moment but that's the most

00:30:12.330 --> 00:30:12.340
about in a moment but that's the most
 

00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:14.070
about in a moment but that's the most
important thing is that your application

00:30:14.070 --> 00:30:14.080
important thing is that your application
 

00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:15.660
important thing is that your application
server needs to be able to send the

00:30:15.660 --> 00:30:15.670
server needs to be able to send the
 

00:30:15.670 --> 00:30:17.250
server needs to be able to send the
messages or needs to be able to tell

00:30:17.250 --> 00:30:17.260
messages or needs to be able to tell
 

00:30:17.260 --> 00:30:19.080

Google Cloud messaging to send the
 

00:30:19.090 --> 00:30:20.430
Google Cloud messaging to send the
messages and as a result you need to

00:30:20.430 --> 00:30:20.440
messages and as a result you need to
 

00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:22.680
messages and as a result you need to
track the users tokens so my

00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:22.690
track the users tokens so my
 

00:30:22.690 --> 00:30:24.240
track the users tokens so my

00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:24.250
demonstration that was just to take them
 

00:30:24.250 --> 00:30:26.100
demonstration that was just to take them
and stick them into a my sequel PHP and

then your application server the other
thing that it has to do is then just

00:30:30.090 --> 00:30:30.100
thing that it has to do is then just
 

00:30:30.100 --> 00:30:31.800
thing that it has to do is then just

be honest but GCM works across we have a
 

00:31:11.530 --> 00:31:13.440
be honest but GCM works across we have a
web client for it so you can actually

00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:13.450
web client for it so you can actually
 

00:31:13.450 --> 00:31:15.540
web client for it so you can actually
send messages to you know HTML

00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:15.550

00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:36.050
 
 

00:31:36.050 --> 00:32:01.910
 
I'm sorry

00:32:01.910 --> 00:32:01.920
 
 

00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:03.570
 
yeah

00:32:03.570 --> 00:32:03.580
yeah
 

00:32:03.580 --> 00:32:05.460
yeah
right that's a lot of good questions

00:32:05.460 --> 00:32:05.470
right that's a lot of good questions
 

00:32:05.470 --> 00:32:08.430
right that's a lot of good questions
there so first of all it's like it's not

00:32:08.430 --> 00:32:08.440
there so first of all it's like it's not
 

00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:10.769
there so first of all it's like it's not
always on it's on when your application

00:32:10.769 --> 00:32:10.779
always on it's on when your application
 

00:32:10.779 --> 00:32:12.239
always on it's on when your application
is running if your application is built

00:32:12.239 --> 00:32:12.249
is running if your application is built
 

00:32:12.249 --> 00:32:15.149

for using GCM that wakelock permission

00:32:15.149 --> 00:32:15.159
for using GCM that wakelock permission
 

00:32:15.159 --> 00:32:16.619
for using GCM that wakelock permission
that I spoke about earlier on is the key

00:32:16.619 --> 00:32:16.629
that I spoke about earlier on is the key
 

00:32:16.629 --> 00:32:18.570
that I spoke about earlier on is the key
to it so the idea behind that is that

00:32:18.570 --> 00:32:18.580
to it so the idea behind that is that
 

00:32:18.580 --> 00:32:20.310
to it so the idea behind that is that
like that's what you know you're giving

00:32:20.310 --> 00:32:20.320
like that's what you know you're giving
 

00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:21.869
like that's what you know you're giving
your app permission to wake the phone up

00:32:21.869 --> 00:32:21.879
your app permission to wake the phone up
 

00:32:21.879 --> 00:32:24.840
your app permission to wake the phone up
on an incoming message I don't know the

00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:24.850
on an incoming message I don't know the
 

00:32:24.850 --> 00:32:26.669
on an incoming message I don't know the
specifics about how much battery it's

00:32:26.669 --> 00:32:26.679
specifics about how much battery it's
 

00:32:26.679 --> 00:32:28.169
specifics about how much battery it's
using but one of the things is that

00:32:28.169 --> 00:32:28.179
using but one of the things is that
 

00:32:28.179 --> 00:32:29.850
using but one of the things is that
we've actually built this to optimize

00:32:29.850 --> 00:32:29.860
we've actually built this to optimize
 

00:32:29.860 --> 00:32:31.680
we've actually built this to optimize
for battery use in these connected

00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:31.690
for battery use in these connected
 

00:32:31.690 --> 00:32:33.749
for battery use in these connected
messaging scenarios so you're always

00:32:33.749 --> 00:32:33.759
messaging scenarios so you're always
 

00:32:33.759 --> 00:32:35.519
messaging scenarios so you're always
listening for messages but it's

00:32:35.519 --> 00:32:35.529
listening for messages but it's
 

00:32:35.529 --> 00:32:37.529
listening for messages but it's
extremely low battery usage I don't have

00:32:37.529 --> 00:32:37.539
extremely low battery usage I don't have
 

00:32:37.539 --> 00:32:39.239
extremely low battery usage I don't have
the stats on how much it is but that's

00:32:39.239 --> 00:32:39.249
the stats on how much it is but that's
 

00:32:39.249 --> 00:32:40.799
the stats on how much it is but that's
one of the core tenets of how we've

00:32:40.799 --> 00:32:40.809
one of the core tenets of how we've
 

00:32:40.809 --> 00:32:42.119
one of the core tenets of how we've
actually built it was to keep the

00:32:42.119 --> 00:32:42.129
actually built it was to keep the
 

00:32:42.129 --> 00:32:44.549
actually built it was to keep the
battery usage as low as possible just to

00:32:44.549 --> 00:32:44.559
battery usage as low as possible just to
 

00:32:44.559 --> 00:32:46.409
battery usage as low as possible just to
repeat the question sorry for the folks

00:32:46.409 --> 00:32:46.419
repeat the question sorry for the folks
 

00:32:46.419 --> 00:32:48.359
repeat the question sorry for the folks
who didn't hear it it was you know if

00:32:48.359 --> 00:32:48.369
who didn't hear it it was you know if
 

00:32:48.369 --> 00:32:50.729
who didn't hear it it was you know if
Google Cloud messaging if an app builds

00:32:50.729 --> 00:32:50.739
Google Cloud messaging if an app builds
 

00:32:50.739 --> 00:32:53.009
Google Cloud messaging if an app builds
using it is always connected in order to

00:32:53.009 --> 00:32:53.019
using it is always connected in order to
 

00:32:53.019 --> 00:32:54.269
using it is always connected in order to
listen to messages what's the impact

00:32:54.269 --> 00:32:54.279
listen to messages what's the impact
 

00:32:54.279 --> 00:32:56.249
listen to messages what's the impact
going to be on the battery and is there

00:32:56.249 --> 00:32:56.259
going to be on the battery and is there
 

00:32:56.259 --> 00:33:06.800
going to be on the battery and is there
any way to turn it off right

00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:06.810
 
 

00:33:06.810 --> 00:33:09.980
 
right so you can build your app to sniff

00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:09.990
right so you can build your app to sniff
 

00:33:09.990 --> 00:33:12.230
right so you can build your app to sniff
for when a connection fails and then you

00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:12.240
for when a connection fails and then you
 

00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:14.540
for when a connection fails and then you
would generate a notification to your

00:33:14.540 --> 00:33:14.550
would generate a notification to your
 

00:33:14.550 --> 00:33:17.150
would generate a notification to your
user if that happened so yes and if you

00:33:17.150 --> 00:33:17.160
user if that happened so yes and if you
 

00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:19.460
user if that happened so yes and if you
are actually disconnected for a period

00:33:19.460 --> 00:33:19.470
are actually disconnected for a period
 

00:33:19.470 --> 00:33:20.870
are actually disconnected for a period
of time like you go off the grid when

00:33:20.870 --> 00:33:20.880
of time like you go off the grid when
 

00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:23.030
of time like you go off the grid when
you come back on the grid GCM actually

00:33:23.030 --> 00:33:23.040
you come back on the grid GCM actually
 

00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:25.160
you come back on the grid GCM actually
has your messages for you and we'll we

00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:25.170
has your messages for you and we'll we
 

00:33:25.170 --> 00:33:27.170
has your messages for you and we'll we
send them to you the messages don't get

00:33:27.170 --> 00:33:27.180
send them to you the messages don't get
 

00:33:27.180 --> 00:33:43.789
send them to you the messages don't get
lost yes something like that yeah

Maroney at google.com and so we have a

00:37:06.030 --> 00:37:06.040
Maroney at google.com and so we have a
 

00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:12.530
Maroney at google.com and so we have a
few minutes if anybody has any questions

00:37:12.530 --> 00:37:12.540
 
 

00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:22.319
 
around what sorry ok

00:37:22.319 --> 00:37:22.329
 
 

00:37:22.329 --> 00:37:25.599
 
whoo so the question for everybody else

00:37:25.599 --> 00:37:25.609
whoo so the question for everybody else
 

00:37:25.609 --> 00:37:27.010
whoo so the question for everybody else
was that in the past have been issues

00:37:27.010 --> 00:37:27.020
was that in the past have been issues
 

00:37:27.020 --> 00:37:28.900
was that in the past have been issues
around token and validations so do we

00:37:28.900 --> 00:37:28.910
around token and validations so do we
 

00:37:28.910 --> 00:37:31.059
around token and validations so do we
need to you know double check our tokens

00:37:31.059 --> 00:37:31.069
need to you know double check our tokens
 

00:37:31.069 --> 00:37:35.410
need to you know double check our tokens
to see I'm not familiar with any token

00:37:35.410 --> 00:37:35.420
to see I'm not familiar with any token
 

00:37:35.420 --> 00:37:37.180
to see I'm not familiar with any token
and validation problems first of all but

00:37:37.180 --> 00:37:37.190
and validation problems first of all but
 

00:37:37.190 --> 00:37:38.650
and validation problems first of all but
I would argue that it's always a good

00:37:38.650 --> 00:37:38.660
I would argue that it's always a good
 

00:37:38.660 --> 00:37:42.010
I would argue that it's always a good
idea to double check and so we have this

00:37:42.010 --> 00:37:42.020
idea to double check and so we have this
 

00:37:42.020 --> 00:37:44.740
idea to double check and so we have this
new instance ID API which is part of

00:37:44.740 --> 00:37:44.750
new instance ID API which is part of
 

00:37:44.750 --> 00:37:46.450
new instance ID API which is part of
Google Cloud messaging and I believe you

00:37:46.450 --> 00:37:46.460
Google Cloud messaging and I believe you
 

00:37:46.460 --> 00:37:48.160
Google Cloud messaging and I believe you
can use that to check your token so

00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:48.170
can use that to check your token so
 

00:37:48.170 --> 00:37:50.319
can use that to check your token so
maybe you know every few days or

00:37:50.319 --> 00:37:50.329
maybe you know every few days or
 

00:37:50.329 --> 00:37:51.280
maybe you know every few days or
something like that of running an

00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:51.290
something like that of running an
 

00:37:51.290 --> 00:37:53.410
something like that of running an
application excuse me that you could

00:37:53.410 --> 00:37:53.420
application excuse me that you could
 

00:37:53.420 --> 00:37:54.970
application excuse me that you could
just do a recheck and validate your

00:37:54.970 --> 00:37:54.980
just do a recheck and validate your
 

00:37:54.980 --> 00:37:57.190
just do a recheck and validate your
token it would be a good idea so over

00:37:57.190 --> 00:37:57.200
token it would be a good idea so over
 

00:37:57.200 --> 00:38:06.430
token it would be a good idea so over
here again is there a round-trip

00:38:06.430 --> 00:38:06.440
here again is there a round-trip
 

00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:18.260
here again is there a round-trip
facility where a server can receive

00:38:18.260 --> 00:38:18.270
 
 

00:38:18.270 --> 00:38:28.130
 
I'm sorry it's hard to

00:38:28.130 --> 00:38:28.140
 
 

00:38:28.140 --> 00:38:43.900
 
yep

00:38:43.900 --> 00:38:43.910
 
 

00:38:43.910 --> 00:38:46.510
 
good question I've never tried it so I

00:38:46.510 --> 00:38:46.520
good question I've never tried it so I
 

00:38:46.520 --> 00:38:51.480
good question I've never tried it so I
don't know I'm only gonna guess my

00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:51.490
 
 

00:38:51.490 --> 00:38:53.650
 
recommend them up through the regular

00:38:53.650 --> 00:38:53.660
recommend them up through the regular
 

00:38:53.660 --> 00:38:54.880
recommend them up through the regular
channel so that way you get the

00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:54.890
channel so that way you get the
 

00:38:54.890 --> 00:38:57.610
channel so that way you get the
guaranteed delivery if you have that

00:38:57.610 --> 00:38:57.620
guaranteed delivery if you have that
 

00:38:57.620 --> 00:38:59.380
guaranteed delivery if you have that
open connection I have no idea what's on

00:38:59.380 --> 00:38:59.390
open connection I have no idea what's on
 

00:38:59.390 --> 00:39:00.790
open connection I have no idea what's on
the other end and how it would respond

00:39:00.790 --> 00:39:00.800
the other end and how it would respond
 

00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:02.950
the other end and how it would respond
to it I would always just recommend you

00:39:02.950 --> 00:39:02.960
to it I would always just recommend you
 

00:39:02.960 --> 00:39:04.990
to it I would always just recommend you
know go by the go through door number

00:39:04.990 --> 00:39:05.000
know go by the go through door number
 

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:16.699
know go by the go through door number
one but I don't know for sure over here

00:39:16.699 --> 00:39:16.709
 
 

00:39:16.709 --> 00:39:18.749
 
okay so the question is when I got the

00:39:18.749 --> 00:39:18.759
okay so the question is when I got the
 

00:39:18.759 --> 00:39:20.370
okay so the question is when I got the
registration token for a device is a

00:39:20.370 --> 00:39:20.380
registration token for a device is a
 

00:39:20.380 --> 00:39:22.499
registration token for a device is a
device specific I have a funny story

00:39:22.499 --> 00:39:22.509
device specific I have a funny story
 

00:39:22.509 --> 00:39:24.959
device specific I have a funny story
about that question because I knew

00:39:24.959 --> 00:39:24.969
about that question because I knew
 

00:39:24.969 --> 00:39:26.939
about that question because I knew
somebody was going to ask it today so I

00:39:26.939 --> 00:39:26.949
somebody was going to ask it today so I
 

00:39:26.949 --> 00:39:28.919
somebody was going to ask it today so I
decided to go and look up the code that

00:39:28.919 --> 00:39:28.929
decided to go and look up the code that
 

00:39:28.929 --> 00:39:31.979
decided to go and look up the code that
I had used in my demo just just check

00:39:31.979 --> 00:39:31.989
I had used in my demo just just check
 

00:39:31.989 --> 00:39:33.630
I had used in my demo just just check
that for sure and it turned out I was

00:39:33.630 --> 00:39:33.640
that for sure and it turned out I was
 

00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:36.120
that for sure and it turned out I was
using deprecated code and so it's like

00:39:36.120 --> 00:39:36.130
using deprecated code and so it's like
 

00:39:36.130 --> 00:39:37.499
using deprecated code and so it's like
then it was like 20 minutes before my

00:39:37.499 --> 00:39:37.509
then it was like 20 minutes before my
 

00:39:37.509 --> 00:39:40.140
then it was like 20 minutes before my
talk and so it's like we are we made a

00:39:40.140 --> 00:39:40.150
talk and so it's like we are we made a
 

00:39:40.150 --> 00:39:41.669
talk and so it's like we are we made a
note upstairs that we're saying before

00:39:41.669 --> 00:39:41.679
note upstairs that we're saying before
 

00:39:41.679 --> 00:39:43.109
note upstairs that we're saying before
you do a talk make sure you don't do

00:39:43.109 --> 00:39:43.119
you do a talk make sure you don't do
 

00:39:43.119 --> 00:39:45.299
you do a talk make sure you don't do
deprecated code so anyway but I'd see

00:39:45.299 --> 00:39:45.309
deprecated code so anyway but I'd see
 

00:39:45.309 --> 00:39:47.130
deprecated code so anyway but I'd see
her question if you're using the

00:39:47.130 --> 00:39:47.140
her question if you're using the
 

00:39:47.140 --> 00:39:50.729
her question if you're using the
instance ID api's you can have a single

00:39:50.729 --> 00:39:50.739
instance ID api's you can have a single
 

00:39:50.739 --> 00:39:53.279
instance ID api's you can have a single
registration token across multiple

00:39:53.279 --> 00:39:53.289
registration token across multiple
 

00:39:53.289 --> 00:39:55.199
registration token across multiple
devices so that if you receive a

00:39:55.199 --> 00:39:55.209
devices so that if you receive a
 

00:39:55.209 --> 00:39:56.849
devices so that if you receive a
notification on one of your devices you

00:39:56.849 --> 00:39:56.859
notification on one of your devices you
 

00:39:56.859 --> 00:39:58.140
notification on one of your devices you
want to receive it on all of them right

00:39:58.140 --> 00:39:58.150
want to receive it on all of them right
 

00:39:58.150 --> 00:40:00.809
want to receive it on all of them right
rather than you know it being routed to

00:40:00.809 --> 00:40:00.819
rather than you know it being routed to
 

00:40:00.819 --> 00:40:02.549
rather than you know it being routed to
multiple ones as then being identified

00:40:02.549 --> 00:40:02.559
multiple ones as then being identified
 

00:40:02.559 --> 00:40:08.819
multiple ones as then being identified
differently it can be so if you can have

00:40:08.819 --> 00:40:08.829
differently it can be so if you can have
 

00:40:08.829 --> 00:40:10.949
differently it can be so if you can have
it so that you have a registration token

00:40:10.949 --> 00:40:10.959
it so that you have a registration token
 

00:40:10.959 --> 00:40:13.229
it so that you have a registration token
that's unique pair device or you can

00:40:13.229 --> 00:40:13.239
that's unique pair device or you can
 

00:40:13.239 --> 00:40:14.939
that's unique pair device or you can
have a registration token that's shared

00:40:14.939 --> 00:40:14.949
have a registration token that's shared
 

00:40:14.949 --> 00:40:18.539
have a registration token that's shared
across ones based on your Google ID all

00:40:18.539 --> 00:40:18.549
across ones based on your Google ID all
 

00:40:18.549 --> 00:40:23.990
across ones based on your Google ID all
right in the back here

00:40:23.990 --> 00:40:24.000
 
 

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:26.790
 
what communications protocol does GCM

00:40:26.790 --> 00:40:26.800
what communications protocol does GCM
 

00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:31.170
what communications protocol does GCM
use so what when you're coming

00:40:31.170 --> 00:40:31.180
use so what when you're coming
 

00:40:31.180 --> 00:40:33.450
use so what when you're coming
downstream from GCM to the server I

00:40:33.450 --> 00:40:33.460
downstream from GCM to the server I
 

00:40:33.460 --> 00:40:35.250
downstream from GCM to the server I
actually don't know I've never looked at

00:40:35.250 --> 00:40:35.260
actually don't know I've never looked at
 

00:40:35.260 --> 00:40:37.290
actually don't know I've never looked at
it if I'm going upstream from my app

00:40:37.290 --> 00:40:37.300
it if I'm going upstream from my app
 

00:40:37.300 --> 00:40:49.630
it if I'm going upstream from my app
server to GCM it's just an HTTP POST

00:40:49.630 --> 00:40:49.640
 
 

00:40:49.640 --> 00:40:51.789
 
so if you've built an application for

00:40:51.789 --> 00:40:51.799
so if you've built an application for
 

00:40:51.799 --> 00:40:54.099
so if you've built an application for
Android TV how do you receive the

00:40:54.099 --> 00:40:54.109
Android TV how do you receive the
 

00:40:54.109 --> 00:40:56.710
Android TV how do you receive the
notification I believe it's just the

00:40:56.710 --> 00:40:56.720
notification I believe it's just the
 

00:40:56.720 --> 00:41:00.870
notification I believe it's just the
same it's you extend the same class the

00:41:00.870 --> 00:41:00.880
 
 

00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:05.140
 
service is not available can you know

00:41:05.140 --> 00:41:05.150
service is not available can you know
 

00:41:05.150 --> 00:41:07.089
service is not available can you know
can I get your details and I'll check in

00:41:07.089 --> 00:41:07.099
can I get your details and I'll check in
 

00:41:07.099 --> 00:41:08.769
can I get your details and I'll check in
on that when I've I've never tried it so

00:41:08.769 --> 00:41:08.779
on that when I've I've never tried it so
 

00:41:08.779 --> 00:41:11.680
on that when I've I've never tried it so
I don't really know time for maybe two

00:41:11.680 --> 00:41:11.690
I don't really know time for maybe two
 

00:41:11.690 --> 00:41:18.160
I don't really know time for maybe two
