DAVEY NICKELS: Please join me
in welcoming Cole Nussbaumer

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.480
Knaflic, "Storytelling
with Data" for Authors At.

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.727
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:14.031 --> 00:00:16.530
Cole was on our team, people
analytics and people operations

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:18.400
here at Google many,
many years ago,

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.360
and she led our
relationship with sales.

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:21.901
And she was known
throughout the team

00:00:21.901 --> 00:00:24.480
for her incredible expertise
with presenting data,

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.630
visualizing data, and
making it actually speak

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:28.520
to clients and to users.

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.630
And lots of funny stories about
Cole, but one that stands out

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.464
is her feelings on pie charts.

00:00:34.464 --> 00:00:36.880
I put together an analysis
once that showed a distribution

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.662
of a specific population
by level or something,

00:00:39.662 --> 00:00:42.120
put it in a beautiful pie chart
that I thought was amazing.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.411
And Cole gave me very
brutally honest feedback

00:00:44.411 --> 00:00:46.410
about how ineffective it
was in actually showing

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:47.618
the differences in the group.

00:00:47.618 --> 00:00:49.390
So Cole, I'm very
curious to hear today

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:51.452
if you still have those
views on pie charts,

00:00:51.452 --> 00:00:53.660
or if maybe they're a little
bit more acceptable now.

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:54.840
COLE NUSSBAUMER KNAFLIC: I
still have a pretty strong view

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:55.980
when it comes to pie charts.

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:56.530
DAVEY NICKELS: OK.

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:58.910
Well, we look forward to hearing
a little more about that.

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:00.170
So the way that this
is going to work

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.740
is we're going to have 30
minutes of a lesson, actually,

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:04.136
from Cole from her book.

00:01:04.136 --> 00:01:06.260
And then second, we're
going to have Q&amp;A, moderated

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.580
by Tina Malm, from
people analytics and me,

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.580
Davey Nickels, from
people analytics as well.

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:12.837
So please, again, join
me in welcoming Cole

00:01:12.837 --> 00:01:14.920
to her first stop on her
book tour here at Google.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.935
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:18.935 --> 00:01:20.310
COLE NUSSBAUMER
KNAFLIC: Awesome.

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.300
So it seems so fitting
for me for Google

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.880
to be the first stop after
the official publication

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.880
of my book, since this is
where so much of it began.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.290
I started at Google back in 2007
on the people analytics team.

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:37.870
And people analytics
is an analytical team

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:40.530
in the people ops
organization here,

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.770
where the goal is
to try to ensure

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.620
that all the decisions
about people--

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:47.779
employees, future
employees-- are data-driven.

00:01:47.779 --> 00:01:49.320
Now, I had the
opportunity of joining

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.080
when the team was
relatively small,

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.420
which meant that I got to
work on a ton of cool stuff

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.650
over the years, learning
about things like what

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:01.260
makes a manager effective, how
do you build productive teams,

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.640
what drives attrition.

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.370
Now, in 2010, we developed
a program called Base Camp.

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:10.780
It was an internal
MBA-like training program

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.470
within people operations.

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.574
And I was asked to build content
on data visualization, which

00:02:15.574 --> 00:02:17.990
was an awesome opportunity,
because I'd always been really

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:19.250
interested in this space.

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.820
But this meant I could pause
and research and understand

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:24.770
why some of the
things I'd arrived

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:28.800
at through trial and error
over time had been effective.

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.640
So as a side note, I can
honestly say that Google for me

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.390
was life-changing.

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.900
I didn't know it at the
time, but the very first time

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.900
I delivered the Data
Visualization course, which

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.360
was at a people ops off-site
in Monterrey, in the very first

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.020
row sat my future husband.

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.710
So you can really say without
the Data Visualization course

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:50.750
here at Google, I
wouldn't have these

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.400
or the third that's on the
way-- super life-changing.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.680
But back on Google, there
was broader interest,

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.567
we were finding, in the
Data Visualization course.

00:03:01.567 --> 00:03:03.150
So we actually ended
up rolling it out

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.110
across Google, which meant
I got the opportunity

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:11.070
to travel to offices in London
and Dublin and Zurich and train

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:14.260
trainers and teach courses.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:15.760
I also got a chance
to teach courses

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.070
across a number of US
offices, including many right

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:21.230
here in Mountain View.

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.180
One of the things that
was interesting for me

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.860
was to see salespeople
and engineers sitting side

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:29.260
by side in those courses.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.730
I came to realize that the
skills needed in this area

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.160
were fundamental.

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.775
They weren't specific
to any given role.

00:03:36.775 --> 00:03:39.710
They also weren't
specific to Google.

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:43.190
Over time, other organizations
started reaching out to me,

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:46.760
wanting me to go teach their
teams and their organizations

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.650
how to communicate
effectively with data.

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.830
So over the course of
the past couple of years,

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:53.840
I've had the opportunity
to work with hundreds

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.040
of different teams across
many different organizations.

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.630
And usually this takes
the form of workshops,

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:03.040
where I'll spend half a
day or a full day teaching

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:06.600
foundational lessons on
communicating with data.

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.130
And oftentimes what I'll
do is solicit examples

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:10.877
from the group ahead
of time, and we'll

00:04:10.877 --> 00:04:12.460
go through the
lessons, and then we'll

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:16.380
spend time talking about that
group's specific examples.

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:20.220
And I'll go through my
makeovers as one potential path

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.560
that leverages the lessons
that we've covered.

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.268
So I thought it might
be cool to take you

00:04:24.268 --> 00:04:25.390
through a couple of these.

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:26.490
We won't go through
them in a lot of detail.

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:28.880
We'll just give you a
visual sense of what

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.490
you can learn in the book.

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:34.760
So this first example is one
from the philanthropic sector.

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:38.100
So it's a foundation that
wanted to start a conversation

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.740
on shifting spending from
non-initiative, which

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.940
is the big, cream-colored
segment at the top left,

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:48.302
to higher education,
that tiny, blue segment.

00:04:48.302 --> 00:04:50.260
So in this case, we change
from the pie chart--

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.970
we've already talked about my
views there-- to this, right?

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:55.470
If we want to shift
spending, let's

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:57.630
say we want to shift
spending and start

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:59.060
a conversation about that.

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:01.710
Use visual cues to draw our
audience's attention to where

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:03.496
we want them to pay it.

00:05:03.496 --> 00:05:05.440
Let's look another example.

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:09.920
This is one from an IT group who
couldn't believe that people,

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:12.250
after looking at this graph,
weren't doing anything

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:13.560
with this information.

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:16.430
Why weren't they acting
upon this information?

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:18.700
Here, it gets totally
lost in the graph, right?

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:21.160
There's no story to
bring it to life.

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.730
Now, the backstory was-- if
we stare at this long enough,

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:26.020
we can see there's a
gap starting to form out

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:28.810
on the right-hand side, where
the number of tickets coming in

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:31.630
are exceeding the number
that are being processed.

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:34.030
Now, the backstory was they'd
lost a couple of resources.

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:35.050
They were understaffed.

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:37.240
And they really wanted to
hire a couple more people.

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.490
And they couldn't understand
why nobody was doing that

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:41.170
based on this graph.

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:44.150
So in this case, we
changed from that to this,

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:46.240
again making that
call to action clear,

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:48.380
annotating the context
directly on the graph,

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:50.940
drawing attention to
that gap that's forming

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:52.760
on the right-hand side.

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:54.540
So I've got one more of these.

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:56.990
This is an example from
a small organization who

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:00.930
was recognizing that their
regional sale composition had

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:03.810
shifted over time
and wanting to have

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:06.790
a conversation about what some
of the implications of that

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:07.647
were.

00:06:07.647 --> 00:06:08.980
Now, this is an interesting one.

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:11.620
I've used this a number
of times in workshops.

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:14.100
And when people
flip to this graph,

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:17.510
there's often a sort of
immediate, negative, visceral

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:20.000
reaction, which is
something we want to try

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.220
to avoid in our audiences.

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:24.030
And now, I can't
imagine all of them

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:25.920
were Packers fans
like my husband.

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:28.960
These are sort of
Broncos colors, right?

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:32.164
But rather that this graph
was unnecessarily confusing.

00:06:32.164 --> 00:06:34.830
Now, the beautiful thing here is
there are some clear take-aways

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:36.012
articulated at the bottom.

00:06:36.012 --> 00:06:37.470
It's just almost
impossible to know

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:41.350
where to look in the data for
evidence of those take-aways.

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:44.750
So in this case, changed
from that to this,

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:46.870
making the focus on the
change, tying the text

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:49.420
directly to the data,
both through proximity

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:51.610
and similarity of color.

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:54.210
Now, one thing to
note is these examples

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:55.650
cross many different industries.

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:58.590
I mentioned before that these
skills are not role-specific.

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:01.870
They're also not really
industry-specific.

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:03.530
Rather, they're foundational.

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:05.890
And over time, through
all of the workshops

00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:07.770
that I've taught over
the past few years,

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:09.870
I've codified these lessons.

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:14.600
And that's what ultimately
led to this, my book.

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:17.700
And I'm super excited to be
able to share with you today

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:19.960
a couple quick lessons
from my new book,

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:21.840
"Storytelling with Data."

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:24.450
So we're going to talk
today about two key lessons,

00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:27.692
first off, focusing attention,
and secondly, telling a story.

00:07:27.692 --> 00:07:29.400
We want to draw one
important distinction

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:31.024
at this point, which
is the distinction

00:07:31.024 --> 00:07:35.450
between exploratory analysis
and explanatory analysis.

00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:37.420
So exploratory analysis,
you perhaps start off

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:39.375
with a question or
hypothesis, or you're just

00:07:39.375 --> 00:07:40.750
digging through
your data, trying

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:42.470
to understand
what's interesting,

00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:45.550
what can I learn about this
data that somebody else

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:47.220
might care about?

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:49.690
Once you've identified
that interesting thing,

00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:52.200
then we move into
explanatory space.

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:54.710
That is where you have
something specific

00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:58.400
you want to communicate
to somebody specific.

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:02.630
And it's this latter space we
want to keep in mind today.

00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:05.020
And when it comes to
explanatory analysis,

00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:07.680
these lessons become more
important than perhaps

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:10.630
any others-- first off,
thinking about where

00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:12.590
you want your audience
to pay attention

00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:16.380
and doing things on purpose
to make that happen,

00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:19.700
and then secondly, never
simply showing data, but rather

00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:23.470
making data a pivotal point
in an overarching story.

00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:25.680
So we'll talk briefly
through each of these.

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:27.780
First off, focusing
attention-- I

00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:30.030
can recall a time at
Google where I was working

00:08:30.030 --> 00:08:31.579
on the Project Oxygen study.

00:08:31.579 --> 00:08:33.120
Quick show of hands--
how many people

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:35.151
are familiar with
Project Oxygen?

00:08:35.151 --> 00:08:36.150
Most people in the room.

00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:40.140
So Project Oxygen was a study
led by my colleague Neil Patel.

00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:43.280
And the goal really was
to try to understand,

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:45.990
on a mathematical,
statistical level,

00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:48.772
what makes managers effective.

00:08:48.772 --> 00:08:50.480
One of the challenges
that we encountered

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:53.980
was, after the study was done,
communicating the results of it

00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:57.440
to a very mixed audience, where
we had both engineers, who

00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:00.084
had a great desire for detail--
they wanted to understand

00:09:00.084 --> 00:09:01.500
the methodology,
they wanted to be

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:03.877
convinced of the
robustness of the analysis.

00:09:03.877 --> 00:09:05.460
At the same time,
we were also wanting

00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:07.480
to communicate to
sales managers,

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:10.910
for example, who were mostly
less concerned with methodology

00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:13.200
and more concerned about
what's in it for me.

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:15.600
How should I act
differently based on this?

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:18.920
And so what we found was by
really being careful about how

00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:22.410
we focused attention, we could
preserve a lot of that detail

00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:25.430
but push it to the background
and make the meta-point pop

00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:27.865
out so that it was clear.

00:09:27.865 --> 00:09:29.240
Let's talk a little
bit about how

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:33.700
people see to get into more of
this how we focus attention.

00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:36.999
So here's a super-simplified
picture of that process.

00:09:36.999 --> 00:09:39.165
On the left-hand side, you
have light refracting off

00:09:39.165 --> 00:09:39.990
a stimulus.

00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:41.760
This gets captured by our eyes.

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:43.610
We don't fully
see with our eyes.

00:09:43.610 --> 00:09:45.960
Rather, most of what we
think of as visual processing

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:47.790
takes place in our brains.

00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:50.080
Now, in the brains there
are a few types of memory

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:52.360
that are important to
understand as we're designing

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:53.520
visual communications.

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:57.380
We'll talk about one of them
today, which is iconic memory.

00:09:57.380 --> 00:09:59.390
Iconic memory is
super short-term.

00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:00.890
It's shorter than
short-term memory,

00:10:00.890 --> 00:10:03.640
and information stays there
for fractions of a second

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:06.760
before it gets forwarded on
to our short-term memory.

00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:08.890
The really cool thing
about iconic memory

00:10:08.890 --> 00:10:10.900
is that it's tuned to a
specific set of what we

00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:13.290
call pre-attentive attributes.

00:10:13.290 --> 00:10:16.180
So let's actually pause here
and do a quick exercise.

00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:18.990
So in a moment, I'm going
to put a bunch of numbers

00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:20.430
up on the screen.

00:10:20.430 --> 00:10:22.790
What I'd like you all
to do as fast as you can

00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:25.060
is count the number
of 3s that you see.

00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:25.560
We got it?

00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:26.930
We're going to count 3s.

00:10:26.930 --> 00:10:29.730
When you know the
answer, shout it out.

00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:31.070
It is a race.

00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:32.451
You would like to win.

00:10:32.451 --> 00:10:33.894
Ready, set, go!

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:44.930
All right, six is
the correct answer.

00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:46.870
This took a bit of
time, though, right?

00:10:46.870 --> 00:10:49.070
You had to physically
read through these four

00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:50.890
lines of text,
look for a 3, which

00:10:50.890 --> 00:10:52.910
is kind of a complicated shape.

00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:54.700
Watch what a
different exercise it

00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:58.699
becomes when I make
one tiny change.

00:10:58.699 --> 00:10:59.740
Don't have time to think.

00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:00.781
Don't have time to blink.

00:11:00.781 --> 00:11:03.790
Suddenly there are six
3s in front of you.

00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:05.890
This is so apparent
so quickly because I'm

00:11:05.890 --> 00:11:07.800
leveraging your iconic memory.

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:09.580
I'm using the
pre-attentive attribute

00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:12.000
of intensity of
color, in this case,

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.890
to make the 3s the one
thing that stand out as

00:11:14.890 --> 00:11:16.440
different from the rest.

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:19.130
Now, this is hugely critical,
because what this means is

00:11:19.130 --> 00:11:22.320
our pre-attentive attributes,
if we use them strategically,

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:24.720
can help enable us
to get our audience

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:27.420
to see what we want them
to see before they even

00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:30.050
know they're seeing it.

00:11:30.050 --> 00:11:32.084
Here are the attributes.

00:11:32.084 --> 00:11:33.500
I won't read through
all of these,

00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:36.690
but notice as your eyes
scan across the screen

00:11:36.690 --> 00:11:38.119
how they're just
drawn to the one

00:11:38.119 --> 00:11:40.160
within each group that's
different from the rest.

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:43.550
You don't really have to
consciously look for it.

00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:45.690
Now, one thing to know
about the attributes

00:11:45.690 --> 00:11:47.930
is people tend to associate
quantitative values

00:11:47.930 --> 00:11:49.960
with some but not others.

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:52.700
For example, most people
will consider a long line

00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:55.260
to represent a greater
value than a short line.

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:57.270
It's one of the
reasons bar charts are

00:11:57.270 --> 00:11:58.810
intuitive for us to read.

00:11:58.810 --> 00:12:02.360
But we don't think of hue,
for example, in the same way.

00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:04.200
If I ask you which is
greater, red or blue,

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:06.360
it's not really a
meaningful question.

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:08.160
And this is important
because it tells us

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:10.110
which of the
attributes can be used

00:12:10.110 --> 00:12:13.130
in code quantitative information
and which should be used

00:12:13.130 --> 00:12:15.890
as categorical differentiators.

00:12:15.890 --> 00:12:18.450
Now as you can perhaps imagine,
pre-attentive attributes

00:12:18.450 --> 00:12:22.560
become huge tools for focusing
our audience's attention when

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:24.830
it comes to visualizing data.

00:12:24.830 --> 00:12:27.900
So here's some sort of generic
data from our annual customer

00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:28.730
survey.

00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:32.410
We can see how we've fared
across a number of dimensions.

00:12:32.410 --> 00:12:36.390
Notice how without other visual
cues, this becomes very much

00:12:36.390 --> 00:12:38.870
like the count-the-3s
example again.

00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:41.210
We have to look at this
data, read through it,

00:12:41.210 --> 00:12:44.240
figure out what might be
important to pay attention to.

00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:46.970
Whereas if I'm the one
communicating this data,

00:12:46.970 --> 00:12:50.200
I should have already done
that for you, in which case

00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:52.990
I can use some pre-attentive
attributes, perhaps paired

00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:55.810
with some explanatory text,
to draw your attention very

00:12:55.810 --> 00:12:58.259
quickly to one part
of the story, right?

00:12:58.259 --> 00:13:00.300
Price and convenience--
we're doing awesome here.

00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:03.050
Let's pause and
celebrate our success.

00:13:03.050 --> 00:13:04.850
Or I can use this
same broad strategy

00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:07.270
to draw your attention to
a totally different place

00:13:07.270 --> 00:13:08.340
in the data.

00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:09.790
But we're struggling
when it comes

00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:11.460
to relationship and brand.

00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:15.520
How can we positively
impact these areas?

00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:19.580
Now, there's a test I like to
employ in trying to figure out

00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:21.780
whether you're using your
pre-attentive attributes

00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:22.820
strategically.

00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:25.730
And that is the Where
Are Your Eyes Drawn Test,

00:13:25.730 --> 00:13:28.320
where you look away from your
visual and look back at it,

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:30.130
or close your eyes
and look back at it,

00:13:30.130 --> 00:13:33.170
and just notice where
your eyes land first.

00:13:33.170 --> 00:13:35.770
Because it's probably
where your audience's eyes

00:13:35.770 --> 00:13:37.330
will land as well.

00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:40.161
So I thought we'd do this
with a series of pictures

00:13:40.161 --> 00:13:41.660
and just talk about
the implications

00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:42.770
for our visual designs.

00:13:42.770 --> 00:13:45.270
So I'm going to put a series
of different pictures up there.

00:13:45.270 --> 00:13:47.260
When I put the picture
up, just shout out

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:49.740
where your eyes go first.

00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:50.550
Ready?

00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:52.470
Where do your eyes
go first here?

00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:53.350
AUDIENCE: Stop.

00:13:53.350 --> 00:13:54.300
COLE NUSSBAUMER KNAFLIC:
Stop sign, right?

00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:56.550
You almost can't look
anywhere else at the onset,

00:13:56.550 --> 00:13:58.190
because it's bright, it's red.

00:13:58.190 --> 00:13:59.940
It's got these big,
bold, capital letters.

00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:02.020
It's outlined in white,
which sets it apart

00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:03.090
from the background.

00:14:03.090 --> 00:14:06.270
We want to think about how
you can use some of those cues

00:14:06.270 --> 00:14:09.385
when you're visualizing data
to draw attention as well.

00:14:09.385 --> 00:14:10.260
Let's do another one.

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:13.316
Where your eyes go here?

00:14:13.316 --> 00:14:14.570
AUDIENCE: The sun.

00:14:14.570 --> 00:14:15.660
COLE NUSSBAUMER KNAFLIC: Yeah,
if you're like most people,

00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:16.454
they go to the sun.

00:14:16.454 --> 00:14:17.870
But if you're like
me, when you're

00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:19.960
trying to look at the sun,
you get this plane sort

00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:21.930
of tugging on your
peripheral vision.

00:14:21.930 --> 00:14:23.310
Or if I try to
look at the plane,

00:14:23.310 --> 00:14:25.970
I can see the sun sort of
wanting to pull me that way.

00:14:25.970 --> 00:14:27.380
So just be aware
that when you're

00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:31.480
emphasizing multiple things
in a graph or on a page,

00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:34.715
this tension can be
created in your audience.

00:14:34.715 --> 00:14:37.330
How about where do
your eyes go here?

00:14:40.675 --> 00:14:42.050
It depends a little
bit, perhaps,

00:14:42.050 --> 00:14:43.180
on where you're
sitting in the room.

00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:45.640
A lot of people will be
drawn to that Perennial Sale

00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:48.160
sign in bright pink,
because it's bright,

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:50.380
because of the black,
bold lettering on it.

00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:51.880
And then most people
from there will

00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:54.540
continue down and rightward.

00:14:54.540 --> 00:14:57.250
And that's because,
without other visual cues,

00:14:57.250 --> 00:15:00.635
we typically start at the top
left of our page or our screen

00:15:00.635 --> 00:15:03.130
and do zigzagging Zs across.

00:15:03.130 --> 00:15:05.640
So in this case, that draw to
the Perennial Sale was strong.

00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:09.060
We started there and then
continued on that Z downward

00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:10.250
and to the right.

00:15:10.250 --> 00:15:11.930
Notice that means
we missed whatever

00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:15.260
was happening in the top
left quadrant, and maybe

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:17.510
that second and third
quadrant as well.

00:15:17.510 --> 00:15:19.690
So to be thoughtful about
the overarching designs

00:15:19.690 --> 00:15:22.760
of the pages on which your
data visualization sits

00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:25.010
and take that into account.

00:15:25.010 --> 00:15:30.230
Just a couple more of these--
where do your eyes go here?

00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:33.180
Everywhere and nowhere
all at the same time.

00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:37.060
Colorful is an awesome
goal for a birthday party.

00:15:37.060 --> 00:15:38.890
Color is not such
an awesome goal

00:15:38.890 --> 00:15:41.230
when it comes to
visualizing data.

00:15:41.230 --> 00:15:42.915
When we make so many
things different,

00:15:42.915 --> 00:15:45.290
we have a lot of stuff competing
for our attention, which

00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:48.960
actually makes it really hard
to look at any one thing.

00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:52.750
Check out the difference in how
your attention is focused here

00:15:52.750 --> 00:15:55.460
versus here, right?

00:15:55.460 --> 00:15:57.100
With the red balloon,
the one thing

00:15:57.100 --> 00:15:58.650
that's different
on the whole page

00:15:58.650 --> 00:16:01.310
we almost can't not look at it.

00:16:01.310 --> 00:16:04.000
That is the power of
color specifically,

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.045
used strategically.

00:16:06.045 --> 00:16:08.290
Let's take a look
now at an example

00:16:08.290 --> 00:16:12.650
from that Project Oxygen study
that I mentioned at the onset.

00:16:12.650 --> 00:16:15.500
This is what one of our
original slides looked like.

00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:17.220
It's been genericized a bit.

00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:19.330
We can see our main
takeaway at the top--

00:16:19.330 --> 00:16:20.920
some elements of
job satisfaction

00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:23.790
are more sensitive to
manager quality than others.

00:16:23.790 --> 00:16:27.660
We've got some categorizations
here and then our data

00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:28.590
at the bottom.

00:16:28.590 --> 00:16:30.840
Here we're not using
color so strategically.

00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:33.329
Here, color is used as a
categorical differentiator.

00:16:33.329 --> 00:16:35.120
There originally, we've
taken them off here

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:36.736
but were categories
along the bottom.

00:16:36.736 --> 00:16:38.860
You can think of those like
Googlegeist categories,

00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:41.890
things like career development
and performance management

00:16:41.890 --> 00:16:44.660
and culture, which is
not necessarily how

00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:46.740
we want to be using our color.

00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:49.712
So in this case, our
redesign looked like this.

00:16:49.712 --> 00:16:50.920
The graph is mostly the same.

00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:53.640
The contents of the page are
pretty much exactly the same.

00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:55.180
We've just rearranged
things a bit

00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:58.790
and used our pre-attentive
attributes, color specifically,

00:16:58.790 --> 00:17:01.790
more thoughtfully to really
draw our audience's attention

00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:04.499
to where we want them to pay it.

00:17:04.499 --> 00:17:06.040
While we draw
attention, we also want

00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:10.000
to think about embedding
our data in story.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.697
By way of a Google anecdote,
I can recall a time

00:17:12.697 --> 00:17:14.780
when I was working with
one of the junior analysts

00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:15.829
on our team.

00:17:15.829 --> 00:17:18.780
And she had just finished
analyzing Googlegeist results,

00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:21.430
results from the annual
employee survey [INAUDIBLE] part

00:17:21.430 --> 00:17:22.980
of the organization
and was getting

00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:24.700
ready to communicate
those results

00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:26.425
to the leader of that team.

00:17:26.425 --> 00:17:27.800
And this particular
team had been

00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:29.310
struggling in a lot of places.

00:17:29.310 --> 00:17:30.580
The scores weren't great.

00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:33.570
So there was some sensitivity
around how that message should

00:17:33.570 --> 00:17:34.850
be delivered.

00:17:34.850 --> 00:17:37.610
And the deck at
that point was page

00:17:37.610 --> 00:17:41.690
after page after page
of the standard report--

00:17:41.690 --> 00:17:45.480
no story and little narrative
to tie it all together.

00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:47.950
It would have been very easy
for the leader of that group

00:17:47.950 --> 00:17:50.070
to say, well,
that's interesting,

00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:51.890
and move on to the next thing.

00:17:51.890 --> 00:17:53.550
That would have been a failure.

00:17:53.550 --> 00:17:56.690
So what I had the analyst do was
set the deck aside and tell me

00:17:56.690 --> 00:17:57.420
the story.

00:17:57.420 --> 00:18:00.720
Tell me what you learned when
you were analyzing this data.

00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:03.810
And when we did that, the
articulation of the story

00:18:03.810 --> 00:18:05.370
was super powerful.

00:18:05.370 --> 00:18:07.020
There were clear
areas for improvement,

00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:09.040
and she knew exactly
where to focus action

00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:11.420
to achieve that improvement.

00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:13.250
This we could use
to light a fire

00:18:13.250 --> 00:18:15.430
under the leader for that team.

00:18:15.430 --> 00:18:18.750
So it's a good example
of how data without story

00:18:18.750 --> 00:18:20.470
isn't always so meaningful.

00:18:20.470 --> 00:18:24.090
But the story can help
bring the data to life.

00:18:24.090 --> 00:18:27.450
So we want to think about how
we can leverage that power when

00:18:27.450 --> 00:18:32.040
we are communicating with data
every time we're doing it.

00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:34.810
Here are some facts on a slide.

00:18:34.810 --> 00:18:36.580
Go ahead and read through these.

00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:47.309
Anybody recognize what
we're looking at here?

00:18:47.309 --> 00:18:48.100
What story is this?

00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:53.350
Red Riding Hood, right?

00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:58.330
But facts on a slide are not
so compelling or memorable.

00:18:58.330 --> 00:19:00.770
If I ask you a day
or two from now,

00:19:00.770 --> 00:19:02.780
what distance was it
from Red Riding Hood's

00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:06.556
house to grandma's, or what time
did Red Riding Hood get there,

00:19:06.556 --> 00:19:08.180
these aren't likely
facts that you will

00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:10.550
have committed to your memory.

00:19:10.550 --> 00:19:13.760
Stories, on the other
hand, are memorable.

00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:15.510
How many people--
quick show of hands--

00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:18.690
know the story of
Red Riding Hood?

00:19:18.690 --> 00:19:20.170
Pretty much everybody
in the room.

00:19:20.170 --> 00:19:21.794
We'll do a quick
thought exercise here.

00:19:21.794 --> 00:19:23.340
We'll just take
about 15 seconds.

00:19:23.340 --> 00:19:25.760
Close your eyes, or
stare up at this screen,

00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:29.260
and I'd like you to recall
for yourself the story of Reg

00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:31.270
Riding Hood,
thinking specifically

00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:35.300
about the plot, the twists, and
the ending-- 15 seconds here.

00:19:51.079 --> 00:19:52.620
Quick show of hands--
how many people

00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:54.790
were able to get to
the high level story?

00:19:54.790 --> 00:19:57.040
People are always a little
afraid to raise their hands

00:19:57.040 --> 00:20:00.560
at this point for fear of
what might happen next.

00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:01.180
Bear with me.

00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:04.710
I'll tell you the story
that resides in my head.

00:20:04.710 --> 00:20:05.964
So Red Riding Hood sets off.

00:20:05.964 --> 00:20:07.130
She has a basket of goodies.

00:20:07.130 --> 00:20:08.171
She's going to Grandma's.

00:20:08.171 --> 00:20:09.430
Grandma's not feeling well.

00:20:09.430 --> 00:20:12.220
And on her way, she
encounters a wolf.

00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:14.190
The wold is able to
extract from her where

00:20:14.190 --> 00:20:17.420
she's going and realizes
that if he's patient,

00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:19.790
he can have not only
one dinner, but two.

00:20:19.790 --> 00:20:24.050
So he races ahead to Grandma's,
eats Grandma, and dress up

00:20:24.050 --> 00:20:25.600
in her clothes,
get into her bed.

00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:28.790
Red Riding Hood arrives
and senses something

00:20:28.790 --> 00:20:30.830
is awry and goes
through a series

00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:34.120
of questioning with the
wolf posing as Grandma.

00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:36.530
Oh, Grandma, how
big your eyes are.

00:20:36.530 --> 00:20:38.490
Oh, Grandma, how
big your ears are.

00:20:38.490 --> 00:20:43.710
Oh, Grandma, how big your teeth
are, to which the wold replies?

00:20:43.710 --> 00:20:45.560
All the better to eat you with.

00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:49.310
So the wolf actually eats
Red Riding Hood as well.

00:20:49.310 --> 00:20:52.690
But then guy with an ax shows
up, cuts open the wolf's belly,

00:20:52.690 --> 00:20:55.600
and the wolf had eaten
Grandma and Red in such haste

00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:56.370
that they're fine.

00:20:56.370 --> 00:20:57.780
They come out.

00:20:57.780 --> 00:21:00.820
And interestingly, if you go
back to the Grimm's original,

00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:02.060
the wolf doesn't die then.

00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:03.810
They actually fill
his stomach with rocks

00:21:03.810 --> 00:21:08.200
and sew him up so that when
he wakes up, he drops dead.

00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:11.530
I think it's a warning
story-- go straight where

00:21:11.530 --> 00:21:13.770
you're intended to go,
don't talk to strangers,

00:21:13.770 --> 00:21:15.310
and so forth.

00:21:15.310 --> 00:21:16.970
But what does this
tell us about what

00:21:16.970 --> 00:21:18.440
we're here to talk about today?

00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:20.820
So for me, stories
like Red Riding Hood

00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:22.800
are evidence of a
couple of things.

00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:25.350
First off is the
power of repetition,

00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:27.940
when you consider it's probably
been some amount of time

00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:30.800
since you've given much thought
to the story of Red Riding

00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:31.470
Hood.

00:21:31.470 --> 00:21:33.990
And yet over the course
of time, you've perhaps

00:21:33.990 --> 00:21:35.940
heard that story
a number of times,

00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:38.650
read the story a number of
times, maybe told the story

00:21:38.650 --> 00:21:40.150
a number of times.

00:21:40.150 --> 00:21:43.220
There's something that happens
with that repetition of use,

00:21:43.220 --> 00:21:46.750
of hearing and saying and
reading things multiple times,

00:21:46.750 --> 00:21:49.440
that helps form a bridge
from our short-term memory

00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:51.250
to our long-term memory.

00:21:51.250 --> 00:21:53.500
The other cool thing that
stories like Red Riding Hood

00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:57.510
illustrate for us is this
magical combination of plot

00:21:57.510 --> 00:21:59.890
and twists and
ending that enable

00:21:59.890 --> 00:22:03.340
things to stick with us in a
way that we can later recall

00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:05.925
and retell to somebody else.

00:22:05.925 --> 00:22:07.800
So we want to think
about how we can leverage

00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:10.410
these powerful concepts
when it comes to the stories

00:22:10.410 --> 00:22:12.710
that we want to
tell with our data

00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:15.910
to get those to be something our
audience will remember in a way

00:22:15.910 --> 00:22:19.960
that they can later recall
and retell to somebody else.

00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:22.631
So when we think about the
components of the story,

00:22:22.631 --> 00:22:24.380
we want to think back
to those same things

00:22:24.380 --> 00:22:26.880
that we talked about with
Red Riding Hood-- the plot,

00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:28.550
the twists, the ending.

00:22:28.550 --> 00:22:32.210
The plot becomes what context
is essential for your audience.

00:22:32.210 --> 00:22:33.852
What do they need
to know in order

00:22:33.852 --> 00:22:35.560
to be in the right
frame of mind for what

00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:37.590
you're going to tell them?

00:22:37.590 --> 00:22:40.010
Then the twists-- what's
interesting about the data

00:22:40.010 --> 00:22:41.640
and what it shows?

00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:43.690
By the way, if
there isn't anything

00:22:43.690 --> 00:22:47.299
interesting about the
data, don't show the data.

00:22:47.299 --> 00:22:49.840
You run the risk of losing your
audience's attention for when

00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:52.810
you do have something
important to say with it.

00:22:52.810 --> 00:22:54.970
And then finally, the
ending, the call to action--

00:22:54.970 --> 00:22:57.340
what do you want
your audience to do?

00:22:57.340 --> 00:23:01.260
My view is we should always want
our audience to do something.

00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:03.550
And we should be working
to make that something as

00:23:03.550 --> 00:23:05.680
clear as possible.

00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:08.400
Because if we simply show
data, as we saw in that case

00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:10.720
with the Googlegeist deck,
it's easy for our audience

00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:13.560
to say, oh, that's interesting,
and move on to the next thing.

00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:16.200
But if we ask for
action, our audience

00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:17.810
has to respond to that.

00:23:17.810 --> 00:23:20.430
And even if they disagree,
it starts a conversation.

00:23:20.430 --> 00:23:21.850
And it's a
conversation may never

00:23:21.850 --> 00:23:24.900
happen if we simply show data.

00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:27.310
Let's take a look at an example.

00:23:27.310 --> 00:23:29.330
So in this scenario,
imagine that you just

00:23:29.330 --> 00:23:31.800
wrapped up a summer
learning program on science.

00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:35.350
The goal was to get kids
excited about science.

00:23:35.350 --> 00:23:37.270
We have some survey
data from a survey

00:23:37.270 --> 00:23:39.220
we gave before the
program on the left

00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:41.820
and after the program on the
right, where children could

00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:44.670
classify their interest
as Bored, Not Great, OK,

00:23:44.670 --> 00:23:46.550
Kind of Interested, and Excited.

00:23:46.550 --> 00:23:48.570
I'll give you moment
to take this in,

00:23:48.570 --> 00:23:49.892
and then we'll talk about it.

00:23:56.030 --> 00:24:00.340
How's it feel comparing
segments across two pies?

00:24:00.340 --> 00:24:03.410
Not so great, right?

00:24:03.410 --> 00:24:07.425
The only thing worse than
a pie, for me personally?

00:24:07.425 --> 00:24:10.050
Two pies, especially when you're
trying to compare across them.

00:24:10.050 --> 00:24:12.280
Because if anything changed in
the data, which it should have

00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:14.390
if there's something interesting
you're trying to say,

00:24:14.390 --> 00:24:16.431
the pieces are all in an
entirely different place

00:24:16.431 --> 00:24:17.437
over there on the right.

00:24:17.437 --> 00:24:19.020
So you always want
to think about what

00:24:19.020 --> 00:24:20.740
do you want to allow
your audience to compare.

00:24:20.740 --> 00:24:22.823
How do you align those
things to a common baseline

00:24:22.823 --> 00:24:25.930
and put them as close
together as possible.

00:24:25.930 --> 00:24:30.000
But check out what happens if I
talk you through the narrative.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.270
So going into the program,
the biggest segment

00:24:32.270 --> 00:24:36.500
of students is 40% in green
felt just OK about science,

00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:39.290
maybe hadn't made up their
minds one way or the other.

00:24:39.290 --> 00:24:42.130
Whereas after the program, a
really cool thing happened.

00:24:42.130 --> 00:24:46.296
That great big 40%
shrunk down to only 14%.

00:24:46.296 --> 00:24:47.920
Now, there was a
little bit of movement

00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:49.660
in the negative direction.

00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:52.430
Bored and Not Great went
up a percentage point each.

00:24:52.430 --> 00:24:55.510
But most of the movement was in
the positive direction, wherein

00:24:55.510 --> 00:24:59.040
after the program, nearly 70%
of kids, if we add together

00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:01.850
that purple and teal
segments, expressed interest

00:25:01.850 --> 00:25:03.650
towards science.

00:25:03.650 --> 00:25:05.190
This is a successful program.

00:25:05.190 --> 00:25:07.770
We should continue to offer it.

00:25:07.770 --> 00:25:10.330
Notice how with a
strong narrative,

00:25:10.330 --> 00:25:13.550
I can actually get away with
a kind of crummy visual.

00:25:13.550 --> 00:25:15.420
The alternative
does not hold true.

00:25:15.420 --> 00:25:17.960
I can have the most
beautiful data visualization

00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:21.414
in the world, and without a
compelling story to go with it,

00:25:21.414 --> 00:25:22.830
to make my audience
care about it,

00:25:22.830 --> 00:25:24.954
to make it something that
resonates with them, that

00:25:24.954 --> 00:25:27.660
sticks with them, I run the
risk of that beautiful data

00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:30.117
visualization falling flat.

00:25:30.117 --> 00:25:31.950
So that's not to say
we shouldn't spend time

00:25:31.950 --> 00:25:33.570
perfecting our
data visualization,

00:25:33.570 --> 00:25:37.710
but rather to underscore
the importance of story.

00:25:37.710 --> 00:25:39.160
And now, nirvana
in this stuff is

00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:41.160
reached when both
are strong-- you

00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:45.510
have a powerful story and an
effective visual to back it up.

00:25:45.510 --> 00:25:48.150
So in this case, we could end up
somewhere like this-- Exposure

00:25:48.150 --> 00:25:50.350
to science excites kids.

00:25:50.350 --> 00:25:52.450
A bit of background,
our call to action,

00:25:52.450 --> 00:25:53.900
let's keep offering this.

00:25:53.900 --> 00:25:55.650
Then we get down to the data.

00:25:55.650 --> 00:25:57.250
How do you feel about science?

00:25:57.250 --> 00:26:00.520
Beforehand, most kids
tied through both color

00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:03.530
and proximity to the data point
that is evidence of that point.

00:26:03.530 --> 00:26:04.936
Most kids felt OK.

00:26:04.936 --> 00:26:06.310
Whereas after the
program, we get

00:26:06.310 --> 00:26:08.304
this pull to the
right-hand side,

00:26:08.304 --> 00:26:09.720
where kids are
feeling interested.

00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:13.240
They're feeling
excited about science.

00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:14.870
That's the kind of
story that we want

00:26:14.870 --> 00:26:16.790
to create for our audience.

00:26:16.790 --> 00:26:19.890
That's the way we want to
be able to focus attention

00:26:19.890 --> 00:26:22.340
for our audience.

00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:24.740
So those are the
quick lessons I have

00:26:24.740 --> 00:26:26.334
to cover here with you today.

00:26:26.334 --> 00:26:27.750
I wanted to give
you a quick sense

00:26:27.750 --> 00:26:30.700
of how they fit in with the
rest of the content in the book.

00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:33.870
So I've listed out
the chapters here.

00:26:33.870 --> 00:26:37.310
Chapter 1 starts off
with a lesson on context,

00:26:37.310 --> 00:26:38.870
having a really
clear understanding

00:26:38.870 --> 00:26:42.929
of who your audience is and
what you want them to know or do

00:26:42.929 --> 00:26:44.470
before you really
spend a lot of time

00:26:44.470 --> 00:26:47.060
creating visuals or content.

00:26:47.060 --> 00:26:49.250
In chapter 2, I talk
about different types

00:26:49.250 --> 00:26:52.750
of common displays used to
communicate business analytics

00:26:52.750 --> 00:26:56.025
and go through some use
cases and examples of each.

00:26:56.025 --> 00:26:58.710
The third chapter is
all about clutter,

00:26:58.710 --> 00:27:00.730
getting comfortable
identifying the stuff that's

00:27:00.730 --> 00:27:04.230
there that isn't adding
information to our visuals

00:27:04.230 --> 00:27:07.330
and stripping those
unnecessary elements away.

00:27:07.330 --> 00:27:09.450
Fourth chapter is on
focusing attention.

00:27:09.450 --> 00:27:13.110
What we looked at today is just
a small subset of much broader

00:27:13.110 --> 00:27:15.620
content that's covered there.

00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:17.840
Fifth lesson is on
thinking like a designer.

00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:19.680
I talk about how
you can leverage

00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:23.430
some concepts of traditional
design, things like affordances

00:27:23.430 --> 00:27:26.880
and accessibility and building
acceptance with your audience

00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:29.480
when it comes to
visualizing data.

00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:33.520
Chapter six looks at a number of
what I consider model visuals,

00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:35.560
and I talk about
the design thought

00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:38.230
process used to create those.

00:27:38.230 --> 00:27:40.824
Chapter 7 is focused on story.

00:27:40.824 --> 00:27:42.240
And again, what
we looked at today

00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:44.710
is just a small piece of that.

00:27:44.710 --> 00:27:46.780
Chapter 8 pulls all of
these lessons together.

00:27:46.780 --> 00:27:50.040
It goes through a single
example from start to finish,

00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:52.700
showing all of these
in coordination.

00:27:52.700 --> 00:27:55.500
Chapter 9 covers
a number of case

00:27:55.500 --> 00:27:58.800
studies on common challenges
faced when visualizing data.

00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:01.600
And then the final
chapter is a wrap-up,

00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:03.920
a recap of what's
learned, talk about where

00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:07.020
to go next, and discuss
building storytelling with data

00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:11.300
competency in your team
and in your organization.

00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:14.520
So before I turn
us over to Q&amp;A, I

00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:17.550
wanted to say a
quick word on Google.

00:28:17.550 --> 00:28:20.840
So when I joined
Google in 2007, I

00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:23.410
was the envy of all my friends.

00:28:23.410 --> 00:28:26.270
And one thing that's
been really cool to see

00:28:26.270 --> 00:28:28.110
as I've talked to
so many people at so

00:28:28.110 --> 00:28:31.090
many different organizations
is that this fascination

00:28:31.090 --> 00:28:33.670
with Google still exists today.

00:28:33.670 --> 00:28:36.650
So one word of advice
from a former Googler

00:28:36.650 --> 00:28:41.270
to current Googlers is to really
just appreciate everything

00:28:41.270 --> 00:28:44.880
that Google has to offer,
take full advantage of all

00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:47.342
of the opportunities
that you have here.

00:28:47.342 --> 00:28:49.050
I like to think that
I did, and it got me

00:28:49.050 --> 00:28:51.620
to a really fantastic place.

00:28:51.620 --> 00:28:54.570
So with that, I say
a very big thank you.

00:28:54.570 --> 00:28:58.490
[APPLAUSE]

00:29:00.064 --> 00:29:00.730
TINA MALM: Cool.

00:29:00.730 --> 00:29:01.810
Thank you so much.

00:29:01.810 --> 00:29:03.390
This was so fantastic.

00:29:03.390 --> 00:29:06.540
I've been exposed to your
ideas for such a long time

00:29:06.540 --> 00:29:10.859
now, since 2009 or since 2010.

00:29:10.859 --> 00:29:11.900
I attended your training.

00:29:11.900 --> 00:29:13.340
Can I not put my feet up there?

00:29:13.340 --> 00:29:14.174
Oh.

00:29:14.174 --> 00:29:15.010
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:15.010 --> 00:29:17.440
I attended your trainings
and I read your book.

00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:20.100
And I just listened to
this fantastic introduction

00:29:20.100 --> 00:29:22.337
to your book, and I still
learned something new.

00:29:22.337 --> 00:29:24.420
And something different
sticks with me every time.

00:29:24.420 --> 00:29:25.836
It's like one of
those good movies

00:29:25.836 --> 00:29:28.300
that you keep watching
over and over again.

00:29:28.300 --> 00:29:33.280
So we want to open up in the
next 15 minutes with Q&amp;A.

00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:36.140
So I have the
microphone, so I'm going

00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:37.854
to be walking
throughout the room

00:29:37.854 --> 00:29:39.770
to see if there are any
questions in the room.

00:29:39.770 --> 00:29:41.820
If you have any questions
for Cole [INAUDIBLE],

00:29:41.820 --> 00:29:42.861
please email [INAUDIBLE].

00:29:45.350 --> 00:29:47.252
I did already
receive one question

00:29:47.252 --> 00:29:48.210
while you were talking.

00:29:48.210 --> 00:29:49.560
And it is not about the book.

00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:53.530
But the question is
from San Francisco.

00:29:53.530 --> 00:29:56.512
So the question was, what
is life outside of Google?

00:29:56.512 --> 00:29:58.720
COLE NUSSBAUMER KNAFLIC:
Oh, life outside of Google--

00:29:58.720 --> 00:29:59.594
so it's rough, right?

00:29:59.594 --> 00:30:02.440
You have to do things like
make your food yourself, go

00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:03.630
to the grocery store.

00:30:03.630 --> 00:30:06.840
No, life outside
of Google is good.

00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:09.290
But it's sad a little
at the same time.

00:30:09.290 --> 00:30:12.230
I think what I miss most
about working at Google,

00:30:12.230 --> 00:30:15.170
hands down, were the
fantastic colleagues who

00:30:15.170 --> 00:30:18.270
I had sort of right there
when I was working here.

00:30:18.270 --> 00:30:19.770
And when you're
working on your own,

00:30:19.770 --> 00:30:22.460
you miss that sort of
sense of camaraderie

00:30:22.460 --> 00:30:24.337
that you get when you
have a team around you.

00:30:24.337 --> 00:30:26.170
So I work with other
people, but it's always

00:30:26.170 --> 00:30:28.350
sort of a person here
or a person there.

00:30:28.350 --> 00:30:29.920
There's not the
same sort of energy

00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:32.910
that you get by being in
an office on a daily basis

00:30:32.910 --> 00:30:35.040
with the people
with whom you work.

00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:37.800
So that's one thing
to keep in mind when

00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:42.210
you venture to the outside if
you're going out on your own.

00:30:42.210 --> 00:30:44.460
TINA MALM: What inspired you
to actually write a book?

00:30:44.460 --> 00:30:46.866
You've been giving
so many workshops.

00:30:46.866 --> 00:30:48.740
COLE NUSSBAUMER KNAFLIC:
Yeah great question.

00:30:48.740 --> 00:30:50.780
So I think for me,
it was about being

00:30:50.780 --> 00:30:55.000
able to bring some of these
lessons to a broader audience.

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:56.550
I love teaching on this.

00:30:56.550 --> 00:30:58.265
I get really excited about it.

00:30:58.265 --> 00:31:00.100
And I like to see
the excitement that

00:31:00.100 --> 00:31:02.680
sort of builds in other people.

00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:05.010
But I can only teach
so many people.

00:31:05.010 --> 00:31:06.039
It's just me.

00:31:06.039 --> 00:31:07.580
So being able to
write the book means

00:31:07.580 --> 00:31:09.580
it can sort of be
out there for anybody

00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:12.350
to pick up and especially for
people who may not otherwise

00:31:12.350 --> 00:31:14.962
have an opportunity to go
to one of the workshops.

00:31:14.962 --> 00:31:18.310
It's nice to be able to
put the lessons out there.

00:31:18.310 --> 00:31:20.070
AUDIENCE: Hey, Cole.

00:31:20.070 --> 00:31:24.050
So my question is about
interactive visuals.

00:31:24.050 --> 00:31:27.110
I would guess that in 2008 or
2009 when you were starting,

00:31:27.110 --> 00:31:29.620
mostly visualization
meant a static thing

00:31:29.620 --> 00:31:30.990
on a piece of paper.

00:31:30.990 --> 00:31:36.040
And now, like "New York Times"
interactive visuals, D3,

00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:37.680
there's so much interactive.

00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:42.260
I'm curious about how you
think about interactive visuals

00:31:42.260 --> 00:31:44.700
in general and
particularly when you think

00:31:44.700 --> 00:31:47.280
they're most appropriate
or any lessons

00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:48.364
about interactive visuals.

00:31:48.364 --> 00:31:50.571
COLE NUSSBAUMER KNAFLIC:
Yeah, great question, David.

00:31:50.571 --> 00:31:52.350
So I tend to focus
in the examples

00:31:52.350 --> 00:31:54.620
that we saw here and in
the book on static visuals.

00:31:54.620 --> 00:31:56.840
When you have a specific
story you're trying to tell,

00:31:56.840 --> 00:31:58.506
how do you get that
across your audience

00:31:58.506 --> 00:32:00.346
in a way that's going
to be effective?

00:32:00.346 --> 00:32:01.720
That said, there's
also certainly

00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:04.690
a place for interactive visuals.

00:32:04.690 --> 00:32:07.230
One thing I would caution
with interactive visuals

00:32:07.230 --> 00:32:09.090
is just questioning
that assumption

00:32:09.090 --> 00:32:10.970
that your audience wants to dig.

00:32:10.970 --> 00:32:12.900
I think sometimes we
think our audience wants

00:32:12.900 --> 00:32:13.750
to dig more than they do.

00:32:13.750 --> 00:32:15.208
Or sometimes they
even tell us they

00:32:15.208 --> 00:32:17.820
want to dig more than
they may actually do.

00:32:17.820 --> 00:32:20.690
And so one way I've
seen done of marrying

00:32:20.690 --> 00:32:23.860
the two is to have that
meta-story and to call that out

00:32:23.860 --> 00:32:26.310
and to highlight it
and to put it in words,

00:32:26.310 --> 00:32:30.590
but then also allow that
interactivity for the audience

00:32:30.590 --> 00:32:33.289
who's going to be inclined
to dig to be able to do that.

00:32:33.289 --> 00:32:35.580
And "New York Times" is a
great example of that, right?

00:32:35.580 --> 00:32:37.204
Because they'll have
a couple headlines

00:32:37.204 --> 00:32:38.660
that they pull
out-- here are some

00:32:38.660 --> 00:32:40.410
of the meta interesting points.

00:32:40.410 --> 00:32:42.440
Are you looking
to rent or to buy?

00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:44.760
Or some of these different
interactive visuals

00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:46.596
that they've put
out over the years.

00:32:46.596 --> 00:32:48.220
But then they also
have all of the data

00:32:48.220 --> 00:32:49.820
there for you to be able
to play around with as,

00:32:49.820 --> 00:32:51.950
well, which can create a
different sort of engagement

00:32:51.950 --> 00:32:53.408
with the audience
as well, which is

00:32:53.408 --> 00:32:54.830
one of the really
powerful things

00:32:54.830 --> 00:32:56.834
about interactive
visualizations.

00:32:56.834 --> 00:32:57.810
Yeah, great questions.

00:32:57.810 --> 00:32:59.080
AUDIENCE: Hey, Cole.

00:32:59.080 --> 00:33:01.320
So kind of building off of
David's question, I think

00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:05.117
another common way that
people look at data that's

00:33:05.117 --> 00:33:06.700
different from
interactive, or I guess

00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:09.610
it's a little more interactive
but different from a static

00:33:09.610 --> 00:33:10.464
is dashboards.

00:33:10.464 --> 00:33:11.880
So we create these
big dashboards,

00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:14.564
and they're sometimes useful,
sometimes they're not.

00:33:14.564 --> 00:33:15.980
But they have a
lot of data there.

00:33:15.980 --> 00:33:18.310
And how do you
think about it when

00:33:18.310 --> 00:33:21.240
it's I guess a little bit more
challenging because you don't

00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:24.470
necessarily know ahead of time
what the story is going to be?

00:33:24.470 --> 00:33:28.410
And so how do you still
capture that story aspect

00:33:28.410 --> 00:33:30.536
when you just don't know
what it will end up being?

00:33:30.536 --> 00:33:32.243
COLE NUSSBAUMER KNAFLIC:
Yeah, dashboards

00:33:32.243 --> 00:33:34.424
are sort of a specific,
different use case as well.

00:33:34.424 --> 00:33:36.340
And when it comes to
dashboards, if you really

00:33:36.340 --> 00:33:38.902
are wanting to allow your
audience to dig and come up

00:33:38.902 --> 00:33:40.610
with their own stories,
then you actually

00:33:40.610 --> 00:33:41.940
want to stay away
from some of the stuff

00:33:41.940 --> 00:33:43.336
that we talked about here today.

00:33:43.336 --> 00:33:45.210
Because as soon as you
use color, especially,

00:33:45.210 --> 00:33:47.168
to draw your audience's
attention to one story,

00:33:47.168 --> 00:33:50.390
it actually makes any other
potential stories much harder

00:33:50.390 --> 00:33:51.650
to see.

00:33:51.650 --> 00:33:55.530
So dashboards, you want to think
about designing in grays when

00:33:55.530 --> 00:33:59.720
you can or using color only as
a categorical differentiator,

00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:04.360
not as a visual cue that
says, draw attention here.

00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:07.410
Dashboards for me fit-- I
talked about this distinction

00:34:07.410 --> 00:34:10.010
between exploratory
and explanatory.

00:34:10.010 --> 00:34:12.560
And for me, dashboards fit
more in the exploratory

00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:15.000
but I think often get
sort of tried to be

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:16.360
used for the explanatory.

00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:19.388
Where a dashboard is sort of,
I've got all of these metrics

00:34:19.388 --> 00:34:20.929
on a single page,
on a single screen.

00:34:20.929 --> 00:34:21.679
I can scan through them.

00:34:21.679 --> 00:34:23.030
I can look for where
things are in line

00:34:23.030 --> 00:34:24.946
with what I expect, where
are they not in line

00:34:24.946 --> 00:34:27.339
with what I expect,
and then pick out, hey,

00:34:27.339 --> 00:34:28.880
something might be
interesting there.

00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:30.420
And then dig in on that.

00:34:30.420 --> 00:34:32.829
And when you can find the
interesting thing, then instead

00:34:32.829 --> 00:34:34.620
of using the dashboard
to communicate that,

00:34:34.620 --> 00:34:37.000
my view is that you should do
the stuff we talked about today

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:38.666
and take that interesting
thing and make

00:34:38.666 --> 00:34:41.050
that the focus and
not necessarily

00:34:41.050 --> 00:34:43.260
confine yourself to
the dashboard for that.

00:34:43.260 --> 00:34:45.340
Because the challenge
in trying to communicate

00:34:45.340 --> 00:34:48.429
to an audience with a dashboard
is by showing them so much,

00:34:48.429 --> 00:34:51.574
it's hard to draw attention
to one particular place.

00:34:51.574 --> 00:34:53.199
AUDIENCE: First of
all, thanks for such

00:34:53.199 --> 00:34:54.282
a compelling presentation.

00:34:54.282 --> 00:34:55.090
It was incredible.

00:34:55.090 --> 00:34:55.414
COLE NUSSBAUMER
KNAFLIC: Awesome.

00:34:55.414 --> 00:34:55.914
Thank you.

00:34:55.914 --> 00:34:57.914
AUDIENCE: My question is,
in addition to reading

00:34:57.914 --> 00:34:59.960
your book, what are some
resources that you could

00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:02.910
recommend for us to
explore data and create

00:35:02.910 --> 00:35:04.436
those effective presentations?

00:35:04.436 --> 00:35:06.560
And on the flip side, what
are your favorite tools?

00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:10.294
Like do you use Tableau or
Sheets, of course, yourself?

00:35:10.294 --> 00:35:11.960
COLE NUSSBAUMER
KNAFLIC: Great question.

00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:15.620
So yeah, when it comes
to getting inspiration

00:35:15.620 --> 00:35:19.610
for visualizing data, there's
a massive amount of content

00:35:19.610 --> 00:35:21.150
out there on the web.

00:35:21.150 --> 00:35:22.550
You Google it,
and you'll come up

00:35:22.550 --> 00:35:25.340
with some great things,
some really fantastic blogs,

00:35:25.340 --> 00:35:26.589
a lot of great work.

00:35:26.589 --> 00:35:28.130
There's also a lot
of not great work.

00:35:28.130 --> 00:35:30.410
And so you sort of want
to have a lens on of,

00:35:30.410 --> 00:35:31.370
what is effective?

00:35:31.370 --> 00:35:32.279
Why is it effective?

00:35:32.279 --> 00:35:33.820
But then also, when
do you see things

00:35:33.820 --> 00:35:35.310
that aren't effective, right?

00:35:35.310 --> 00:35:38.410
Just because it's put out
by a recognized publication

00:35:38.410 --> 00:35:43.230
doesn't necessarily mean that
they're visualizing data well.

00:35:43.230 --> 00:35:46.379
But some sources of
consistently good work

00:35:46.379 --> 00:35:48.670
are places like-- we talked
about the "New York Times,"

00:35:48.670 --> 00:35:50.940
the "Wall Street Journal."
"National Geographic"

00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:54.530
does some really great
data visualizations.

00:35:54.530 --> 00:35:57.385
When it comes to
tools in particular,

00:35:57.385 --> 00:35:58.760
everything we
looked at today was

00:35:58.760 --> 00:36:01.430
Excel, which is what I
find myself using primarily

00:36:01.430 --> 00:36:04.970
because it's what most
of my clients use.

00:36:04.970 --> 00:36:07.170
Tableau is certainly
increasingly popular.

00:36:07.170 --> 00:36:10.340
My view is you should
find a tool, pick a tool,

00:36:10.340 --> 00:36:12.200
and get to know
it as best you can

00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:14.170
so that it doesn't
become a limiting factor

00:36:14.170 --> 00:36:16.780
in applying some of the things
that we talked about today.

00:36:16.780 --> 00:36:20.989
Any tool can be used well, and
any tool can be used poorly.

00:36:20.989 --> 00:36:22.530
And the cool things
about the lessons

00:36:22.530 --> 00:36:24.240
we went through today and
the lessons in the book

00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:25.970
is they're not specific
to any given tool.

00:36:25.970 --> 00:36:26.886
They're tool agnostic.

00:36:26.886 --> 00:36:29.310
They are foundational
principles that you can apply

00:36:29.310 --> 00:36:32.410
in varying extent in any tool.

00:36:32.410 --> 00:36:35.030
AUDIENCE: I had question just
around what you have seen,

00:36:35.030 --> 00:36:37.920
or if you've seen, any
particular learnings as

00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:39.340
regards to localization?

00:36:39.340 --> 00:36:42.249
Or when you talked
about iconography

00:36:42.249 --> 00:36:44.040
towards the beginning
of your presentation,

00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:46.289
I know that's so different
that we see in street signs

00:36:46.289 --> 00:36:47.980
depending on what
country you're in.

00:36:47.980 --> 00:36:50.680
Curious if you've seen that at
all with the data visualization

00:36:50.680 --> 00:36:52.472
side of things, including
maybe with color.

00:36:52.472 --> 00:36:53.721
COLE NUSSBAUMER KNAFLIC: Yeah.

00:36:53.721 --> 00:36:55.650
And color is the place
that comes to my mind

00:36:55.650 --> 00:36:57.550
immediately with that question.

00:36:57.550 --> 00:37:00.810
Because one thing to be
aware of, color in particular

00:37:00.810 --> 00:37:04.930
has this unique ability
to impart tone and sort

00:37:04.930 --> 00:37:06.460
of incite emotions.

00:37:06.460 --> 00:37:08.460
And so you always want
to think about how you're

00:37:08.460 --> 00:37:10.430
using color and
what sort of tone

00:37:10.430 --> 00:37:12.300
you want to set,
whether it's in a graph

00:37:12.300 --> 00:37:15.870
or in the broader communication
that contains that graph,

00:37:15.870 --> 00:37:18.829
and use color to reinforce that.

00:37:18.829 --> 00:37:20.620
But on that note, one
thing to keep in mind

00:37:20.620 --> 00:37:22.940
is that different cultures
associate different meanings

00:37:22.940 --> 00:37:24.190
with different colors.

00:37:24.190 --> 00:37:25.752
So depending on who
your audience is,

00:37:25.752 --> 00:37:27.210
who you're
communicating to, that's

00:37:27.210 --> 00:37:28.910
something to take into account.

00:37:28.910 --> 00:37:32.820
David McCandless has its
beautiful sort of visualization

00:37:32.820 --> 00:37:34.920
that's at the same time
an interesting tool

00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:36.260
for visualizing data.

00:37:36.260 --> 00:37:38.010
It's called Colours and Culture.

00:37:38.010 --> 00:37:39.970
And it's this big color wheel.

00:37:39.970 --> 00:37:41.770
And "Colours" in
that case is British.

00:37:41.770 --> 00:37:42.480
He's British.

00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:45.720
C-O-L-O-U-R-S.

00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:47.530
But it shows you
the connotations

00:37:47.530 --> 00:37:50.330
that different colors have
in different cultures.

00:37:50.330 --> 00:37:53.950
So it can be a very useful
tool if you are communicating

00:37:53.950 --> 00:37:56.070
to an international audience.

00:37:56.070 --> 00:37:59.360
His site is
informationisbeautiful.net.

00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:00.310
Great question.

00:38:00.310 --> 00:38:02.450
AUDIENCE: My question is,
if we have a lot of data

00:38:02.450 --> 00:38:05.130
that we want to show, like
there are lots of key insights

00:38:05.130 --> 00:38:07.270
that we want to pull,
would you suggest

00:38:07.270 --> 00:38:09.776
that we try to parse them
out into different pieces?

00:38:09.776 --> 00:38:11.650
Or do you have a
recommendation for something

00:38:11.650 --> 00:38:13.430
that we could use
to kind of point

00:38:13.430 --> 00:38:15.500
out all the different insights?

00:38:15.500 --> 00:38:15.830
COLE NUSSBAUMER
KNAFLIC: Yeah, I have

00:38:15.830 --> 00:38:17.038
a couple of thoughts on that.

00:38:17.038 --> 00:38:20.140
So one thought is when you
have a lot of different things

00:38:20.140 --> 00:38:21.890
you want to say about
the same data set is

00:38:21.890 --> 00:38:26.100
to step back and figure out,
is there an overarching story

00:38:26.100 --> 00:38:28.980
that you can use to weave
all of those disparate pieces

00:38:28.980 --> 00:38:29.740
together?

00:38:29.740 --> 00:38:32.910
So as we talked about, that's
one way of really making

00:38:32.910 --> 00:38:35.060
it memorable for your audience.

00:38:35.060 --> 00:38:38.650
A specific strategy you can
use, depending on the situation,

00:38:38.650 --> 00:38:41.980
is something similar to what we
looked at with that generic bar

00:38:41.980 --> 00:38:45.086
graph from the
customer survey, where

00:38:45.086 --> 00:38:46.460
if you're showing
a bunch of data

00:38:46.460 --> 00:38:48.793
and you want to be able to
talk your audience through it

00:38:48.793 --> 00:38:50.920
but then focus on one
specific thing at a time,

00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:52.610
you can start off
with just the data,

00:38:52.610 --> 00:38:54.620
or even just a blank
graph sometimes

00:38:54.620 --> 00:38:58.130
that has the axes labeled and
titled but no actual data.

00:38:58.130 --> 00:39:00.750
Explain to your audience what
they're going to be looking at.

00:39:00.750 --> 00:39:02.260
Then you layer on the data.

00:39:02.260 --> 00:39:04.955
And then you maybe use
color or another visual cue

00:39:04.955 --> 00:39:06.830
to draw your audience's
attention to one part

00:39:06.830 --> 00:39:07.950
and talk about that.

00:39:07.950 --> 00:39:10.950
Then draw attention to another
part, and then talk about that.

00:39:10.950 --> 00:39:13.480
It's a nice way of it being
able to build familiarity

00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:16.640
with the data with your
audience as you talk through it

00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:18.480
and then also focus
attention really

00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:21.050
specifically within
that broader data set

00:39:21.050 --> 00:39:24.050
when you have specific things
you want to say about it.

00:39:24.050 --> 00:39:25.310
Great question.

00:39:25.310 --> 00:39:27.370
TINA MALM: Let me
ask you one more.

00:39:27.370 --> 00:39:29.520
Your opinions about
green-- I noticed

00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:31.692
that you didn't use any
green on the slides.

00:39:31.692 --> 00:39:33.650
COLE NUSSBAUMER KNAFLIC:
Oh, interesting point.

00:39:33.650 --> 00:39:36.500
So that was by accident
probably more than intentional.

00:39:36.500 --> 00:39:38.070
Although back on
the topic of color,

00:39:38.070 --> 00:39:39.611
one thing you want
to be sensitive to

00:39:39.611 --> 00:39:40.980
is color blindness.

00:39:40.980 --> 00:39:43.940
So roughly 8% of men and
half a percent of women

00:39:43.940 --> 00:39:46.710
experience some form
of color blindness.

00:39:46.710 --> 00:39:48.210
Most typically that
manifests itself

00:39:48.210 --> 00:39:50.430
as difficulty in
distinguishing between shades

00:39:50.430 --> 00:39:52.390
of red and shades
of green, which

00:39:52.390 --> 00:39:55.460
means you want to, in general,
avoid using shades of red

00:39:55.460 --> 00:39:56.921
and shades of green together.

00:39:56.921 --> 00:39:59.170
Or if you want to leverage
that connotation, green, it

00:39:59.170 --> 00:40:00.330
went up-- that's good--
red, it went down--

00:40:00.330 --> 00:40:01.900
that's bad-- you can do so.

00:40:01.900 --> 00:40:04.880
Just make sure you have some
additional visual cues there.

00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:06.090
Make the numbers also bold.

00:40:06.090 --> 00:40:07.923
Put the plus or minus
sign in front of them.

00:40:07.923 --> 00:40:09.790
Do something else to
set them apart visually

00:40:09.790 --> 00:40:11.670
so you're not inadvertently
disenfranchising

00:40:11.670 --> 00:40:12.930
part of your audience.

00:40:12.930 --> 00:40:16.550
Personally, I tend to do
my designs mostly in gray

00:40:16.550 --> 00:40:19.680
and then use blue really
sparingly to draw tension.

00:40:19.680 --> 00:40:22.000
I like blue because you
avoid the color blind issues.

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:25.100
It also prints well in black
and white if that's a concern.

00:40:25.100 --> 00:40:29.770
But that said, blue is
certainly not your only option.

00:40:29.770 --> 00:40:32.010
So we talked about the
tones of different colors.

00:40:32.010 --> 00:40:34.510
You want to think about brand
colors and all of these things

00:40:34.510 --> 00:40:38.626
and how those can fold into
how you visualize your data.

00:40:38.626 --> 00:40:40.500
DAVEY NICKELS: Cole, I
just want to point out

00:40:40.500 --> 00:40:42.094
that even though
you haven't been

00:40:42.094 --> 00:40:44.760
at Google for a number of years,
you're still super influential,

00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:48.451
and I see a lot of great
slides that are blue or gray.

00:40:48.451 --> 00:40:51.480
And I, for one, have a delight
in cutting all the clutter.

00:40:51.480 --> 00:40:53.020
And I think it's because of you.

00:40:53.020 --> 00:40:54.446
So thank you so much
for your contributions.

00:40:54.446 --> 00:40:54.830
COLE NUSSBAUMER
KNAFLIC: Awesome.

00:40:54.830 --> 00:40:56.250
DAVEY NICKELS: One question
that we had for you,

00:40:56.250 --> 00:40:58.460
we've talked a lot about
the "what" in the book.

00:40:58.460 --> 00:40:59.971
I'm also curious
about the "how."

00:40:59.971 --> 00:41:02.220
What was the most difficult
part of writing this book?

00:41:02.220 --> 00:41:03.390
I mean, was it a
bigger challenge

00:41:03.390 --> 00:41:04.170
than you had predicted?

00:41:04.170 --> 00:41:05.794
Like what was super
difficult about it?

00:41:05.794 --> 00:41:09.100
COLE NUSSBAUMER KNAFLIC:
Yeah, that's a tough question.

00:41:09.100 --> 00:41:11.290
So I tend to be very
organized and very structured.

00:41:11.290 --> 00:41:13.987
So once I decided I was
going to do this, I set out,

00:41:13.987 --> 00:41:16.320
and I made the plan of here's
what each chapter is going

00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:18.200
to be, here's the
timeline, set some sort

00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:21.260
of aggressive timelines
with my publisher.

00:41:21.260 --> 00:41:23.850
I think really the
hardest part was time.

00:41:23.850 --> 00:41:26.250
Because actually physically
writing and creating

00:41:26.250 --> 00:41:28.480
all of the visuals
takes a lot of time.

00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:31.050
As you saw, there are
a couple small people

00:41:31.050 --> 00:41:33.910
who live at my house.

00:41:33.910 --> 00:41:36.090
Yeah, so time was
precious, so trying

00:41:36.090 --> 00:41:38.547
to fit in between all
of life's other things

00:41:38.547 --> 00:41:41.130
was challenging at times but I
think overall worked out really

00:41:41.130 --> 00:41:42.210
well.

00:41:42.210 --> 00:41:43.780
TINA MALM: What's
one thing you see

00:41:43.780 --> 00:41:46.290
people doing consistency wrong?

00:41:46.290 --> 00:41:49.940
If there's one message you
want the audience to take away,

00:41:49.940 --> 00:41:50.890
what would it be?

00:41:50.890 --> 00:41:52.306
COLE NUSSBAUMER
KNAFLIC: Well, I'm

00:41:52.306 --> 00:41:56.540
going to parlay that into two
things, because I can do that.

00:41:56.540 --> 00:41:59.160
So we talked about color
a bit, but the lowest

00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:01.591
hanging fruit,
typically, when I'm

00:42:01.591 --> 00:42:03.090
working with different
organizations

00:42:03.090 --> 00:42:06.710
is being thoughtful
in their use of color.

00:42:06.710 --> 00:42:08.900
I think when it comes to
communicating with data,

00:42:08.900 --> 00:42:12.570
you never want to use color
to make something colorful.

00:42:12.570 --> 00:42:16.570
But rather color, when used
sparingly and strategically,

00:42:16.570 --> 00:42:18.370
can be one of your
most powerful tools

00:42:18.370 --> 00:42:20.510
for drawing your audience's
attention to where

00:42:20.510 --> 00:42:22.160
you want them to pay it.

00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:25.710
So being intentional in your use
of color would be one big tip.

00:42:25.710 --> 00:42:27.290
The other, and we
talked about this,

00:42:27.290 --> 00:42:29.080
would be to never
just show data.

00:42:29.080 --> 00:42:32.520
Always have a story and
articulate that story

00:42:32.520 --> 00:42:34.870
in words, either
through your voiceover

00:42:34.870 --> 00:42:38.250
or, if it's on a slide or on
a graph, through physical text

00:42:38.250 --> 00:42:40.390
on that graph so that
your audience isn't

00:42:40.390 --> 00:42:42.480
left guessing what they're
meant to get out of it,

00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:45.160
but rather you've put
that work there for them.

00:42:45.160 --> 00:42:46.910
DAVEY NICKELS: Cole,
you gave us a preview

00:42:46.910 --> 00:42:49.350
on focusing attention
and telling a story,

00:42:49.350 --> 00:42:51.580
but I'm curious of the
other eight chapters.

00:42:51.580 --> 00:42:54.834
Of all the 10 in the book,
what was your favorite and why?

00:42:54.834 --> 00:42:56.750
COLE NUSSBAUMER KNAFLIC:
Interesting question.

00:42:56.750 --> 00:42:59.190
I think for me, my
favorite was actually

00:42:59.190 --> 00:43:01.050
the chapter on storytelling.

00:43:01.050 --> 00:43:04.840
Because for me, that
was the one that

00:43:04.840 --> 00:43:07.280
was harder than the others.

00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:09.600
The book goes much more
in depth on storytelling

00:43:09.600 --> 00:43:11.910
than I've historically
gone in the workshops.

00:43:11.910 --> 00:43:13.610
So for some of
the chapters, they

00:43:13.610 --> 00:43:16.090
were pretty to write, because
it was mostly just writing

00:43:16.090 --> 00:43:18.710
the words that I say
in the workshops.

00:43:18.710 --> 00:43:20.960
But the storytelling chapter
was not like that at all.

00:43:20.960 --> 00:43:22.764
I paused, and I did
a lot of research,

00:43:22.764 --> 00:43:24.180
and I tried to
organize it one way

00:43:24.180 --> 00:43:25.960
and then realized that wasn't
working, tried to organize it

00:43:25.960 --> 00:43:26.450
another way.

00:43:26.450 --> 00:43:28.350
So it was a lot of going
back to the drawing board

00:43:28.350 --> 00:43:30.650
and trying to figure out, how
do the pieces fit together?

00:43:30.650 --> 00:43:32.441
How can I weave it
together in a way that's

00:43:32.441 --> 00:43:35.220
going to be compelling
for people reading it

00:43:35.220 --> 00:43:38.090
and be understandable
for people reading it?

00:43:38.090 --> 00:43:40.780
But I actually am really happy
with how that one turned out.

00:43:40.780 --> 00:43:42.490
So I think that's probably
my favorite chapter.

00:43:42.490 --> 00:43:43.880
TINA MALM: Your
target audience--

00:43:43.880 --> 00:43:46.030
who do you think your
target audience is?

00:43:46.030 --> 00:43:47.530
COLE NUSSBAUMER
KNAFLIC: It's really

00:43:47.530 --> 00:43:49.610
anybody who has a need
to communicate with data,

00:43:49.610 --> 00:43:53.120
so whether that's working with
data on a daily basis or less

00:43:53.120 --> 00:43:53.970
frequently.

00:43:53.970 --> 00:43:56.360
And the concepts
that we talk about,

00:43:56.360 --> 00:43:58.844
or that I talk about in
the book, the examples

00:43:58.844 --> 00:44:00.510
are specific to data,
for the most part,

00:44:00.510 --> 00:44:03.410
but really it's any time you
need to communicate visually

00:44:03.410 --> 00:44:04.700
to an audience.

00:44:04.700 --> 00:44:06.760
And a lot of it goes
back to really thinking

00:44:06.760 --> 00:44:09.390
about who your
audience is and how

00:44:09.390 --> 00:44:11.902
you want them to use the
information that you're putting

00:44:11.902 --> 00:44:14.110
in front of them and then
just designing thoughtfully

00:44:14.110 --> 00:44:15.366
with that in mind.

00:44:15.366 --> 00:44:16.740
DAVEY NICKELS:
Cole, one question

00:44:16.740 --> 00:44:17.930
that kind of came up
in the audience is

00:44:17.930 --> 00:44:19.450
like what are other
resources that are available?

00:44:19.450 --> 00:44:20.825
What are other
experts out there?

00:44:20.825 --> 00:44:25.010
So expanding on that question,
somebody like an Edward Tufte,

00:44:25.010 --> 00:44:27.840
do you talk to people
that are known for being

00:44:27.840 --> 00:44:29.389
data visualization experts?

00:44:29.389 --> 00:44:30.930
And I'm really
curious to hear if you

00:44:30.930 --> 00:44:32.221
disagree with them on anything.

00:44:32.221 --> 00:44:34.660
Or have you ever had like a
data viz like battle-it-out

00:44:34.660 --> 00:44:35.390
or something?

00:44:35.390 --> 00:44:36.860
COLE NUSSBAUMER KNAFLIC:
[LAUGHING] Great question.

00:44:36.860 --> 00:44:38.820
And actually, we'll come back
to pie charts on this question.

00:44:38.820 --> 00:44:39.550
Yeah, absolutely.

00:44:39.550 --> 00:44:42.610
Data viz is a really
fun community.

00:44:42.610 --> 00:44:44.490
It's relatively close-knit.

00:44:44.490 --> 00:44:46.324
The main players all
sort of know each other

00:44:46.324 --> 00:44:48.614
or know of each other, and
we have some correspondence.

00:44:48.614 --> 00:44:50.360
And one of the things
that's really cool

00:44:50.360 --> 00:44:53.950
is that there's really a
lot of open sharing, right?

00:44:53.950 --> 00:44:55.840
Because the goal is to
make everybody better,

00:44:55.840 --> 00:44:58.550
everybody more
effective at this stuff.

00:44:58.550 --> 00:45:01.570
But one particular
disagreement-- so Robert Kosara

00:45:01.570 --> 00:45:06.510
is one of the main data
visualization researcher guys

00:45:06.510 --> 00:45:07.740
at Tableau.

00:45:07.740 --> 00:45:11.610
And he was actually one of
the reviewers on my book.

00:45:11.610 --> 00:45:16.660
And he disagrees that pie
charts are inherently evil.

00:45:16.660 --> 00:45:20.880
And so he and I have had
some decent debate on this.

00:45:20.880 --> 00:45:23.700
My view is relatively
strong, that pie charts,

00:45:23.700 --> 00:45:25.369
you can say some
general things, right?

00:45:25.369 --> 00:45:27.160
This segment is big,
this segment is small.

00:45:27.160 --> 00:45:29.618
But you can't really say how
much bigger, how much smaller,

00:45:29.618 --> 00:45:34.236
answer some of the more
specific questions.

00:45:34.236 --> 00:45:36.610
Whereas his view is a pie
chart absolutely has its place.

00:45:36.610 --> 00:45:38.970
It is the most effective
visual for communicating

00:45:38.970 --> 00:45:41.510
a part of a whole.

00:45:41.510 --> 00:45:44.860
But people often
misuse them and use

00:45:44.860 --> 00:45:47.910
them to try to do other
things outside of that.

00:45:47.910 --> 00:45:50.320
So his view is, rather than
banish them completely,

00:45:50.320 --> 00:45:53.840
let's teach people how
to use them smartly.

00:45:53.840 --> 00:45:54.550
I disagree.

00:45:54.550 --> 00:45:57.010
But we've agreed to disagree,
and we're on good terms.

00:45:57.010 --> 00:45:57.800
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:57.800 --> 00:45:59.056
DAVEY NICKELS: That's awesome.

00:45:59.056 --> 00:46:01.180
TINA MALM: Cole, you've
conducted so many workshops

00:46:01.180 --> 00:46:02.510
on this topic.

00:46:02.510 --> 00:46:07.700
Have you noticed any differences
between people attending

00:46:07.700 --> 00:46:10.300
these workshops between
various industries, people

00:46:10.300 --> 00:46:13.680
from the tech sector versus
academics versus people

00:46:13.680 --> 00:46:14.990
from the banking industry?

00:46:14.990 --> 00:46:16.660
COLE NUSSBAUMER KNAFLIC: Yeah,
I think there are absolutely

00:46:16.660 --> 00:46:18.590
differences when it
comes to just culturally

00:46:18.590 --> 00:46:20.800
how do different
organizations deal with data,

00:46:20.800 --> 00:46:22.820
communicate with data?

00:46:22.820 --> 00:46:25.320
But one thing that's been cool
to see is that these lessons,

00:46:25.320 --> 00:46:28.280
they stay the same
irrespective of industry.

00:46:28.280 --> 00:46:31.140
They sort of cut
across all industries,

00:46:31.140 --> 00:46:32.110
which is interesting.

00:46:32.110 --> 00:46:36.800
And for me, being able to
see the organization's data

00:46:36.800 --> 00:46:38.660
and see some of how
they've communicated

00:46:38.660 --> 00:46:40.090
with data before
going in gives me

00:46:40.090 --> 00:46:45.006
such an interesting perspective
and lens on the organization.

00:46:45.006 --> 00:46:46.380
But I think there
are differences

00:46:46.380 --> 00:46:48.910
in how organizations use
data, but the concepts

00:46:48.910 --> 00:46:52.260
that we talk about in the
book really span everything.

00:46:52.260 --> 00:46:54.070
DAVEY NICKELS:
Cole, one question--

00:46:54.070 --> 00:46:56.820
you mentioned that you did a
lot of research for the book.

00:46:56.820 --> 00:46:58.280
You mentioned
some, I'm guessing,

00:46:58.280 --> 00:46:59.720
neuroscience-type concepts.

00:46:59.720 --> 00:47:01.360
What sort of
disciplines did you draw

00:47:01.360 --> 00:47:04.450
on when you were
researching or composing

00:47:04.450 --> 00:47:06.510
as you've become more
and more of an expert?

00:47:06.510 --> 00:47:08.968
COLE NUSSBAUMER KNAFLIC: Yeah,
one of the interdisciplinary

00:47:08.968 --> 00:47:10.970
places that I've drawn a
lot of inspiration from

00:47:10.970 --> 00:47:14.280
is just the area
of physical design.

00:47:14.280 --> 00:47:18.930
When you think about if
you're designing a chair,

00:47:18.930 --> 00:47:21.120
how do you make that
work for your audience?

00:47:21.120 --> 00:47:23.010
And now data is different
because it's not

00:47:23.010 --> 00:47:24.860
sort of a tangible thing.

00:47:24.860 --> 00:47:27.610
So the things you
have at your disposal

00:47:27.610 --> 00:47:31.640
to show how to use
something is not tangible.

00:47:31.640 --> 00:47:33.320
It's visual.

00:47:33.320 --> 00:47:35.880
So then it's thinking about,
how do you visualize this?

00:47:35.880 --> 00:47:39.420
How do people see, bringing in
some of those sorts of things.

00:47:39.420 --> 00:47:43.140
One example that I like-- are
people familiar with the OXO

00:47:43.140 --> 00:47:45.610
brand of kitchen gadgets?

00:47:45.610 --> 00:47:48.470
So there's things like
vegetable peelers or spatulas

00:47:48.470 --> 00:47:50.990
or like a garlic press.

00:47:50.990 --> 00:47:55.010
And if you just sort of
lay them out on a counter,

00:47:55.010 --> 00:47:56.691
it's intuitive how
to pick them up.

00:47:56.691 --> 00:47:59.190
And you don't even realize that
when you're picking them up,

00:47:59.190 --> 00:48:01.030
because they're
formed in a way that's

00:48:01.030 --> 00:48:02.738
going to make you pick
them up in the way

00:48:02.738 --> 00:48:04.450
they're intended
to be used, which

00:48:04.450 --> 00:48:06.326
is brilliant from a
design standpoint.

00:48:06.326 --> 00:48:07.700
And we want to
think about how we

00:48:07.700 --> 00:48:12.470
can leverage those same sort of
cues when it comes to our data.

00:48:12.470 --> 00:48:14.640
How do you make it so
obvious to the audience

00:48:14.640 --> 00:48:17.140
how they're supposed to use
that data that they can't use

00:48:17.140 --> 00:48:19.700
it any other way, that
they can't help but see

00:48:19.700 --> 00:48:21.860
what you want them to see?

00:48:21.860 --> 00:48:24.430
So design is probably
one of the big places

00:48:24.430 --> 00:48:26.470
that I drew from when
it came to researching

00:48:26.470 --> 00:48:28.029
some of the stuff for the book.

00:48:28.029 --> 00:48:29.820
TINA MALM: In regards
to tools, earlier you

00:48:29.820 --> 00:48:31.660
mentioned Excel and PowerPoint.

00:48:31.660 --> 00:48:34.320
But are there any other
tools I need to be fluent in

00:48:34.320 --> 00:48:35.530
to apply your lessons?

00:48:35.530 --> 00:48:37.120
COLE NUSSBAUMER KNAFLIC:
No, and not necessarily

00:48:37.120 --> 00:48:38.680
be Excel and
PowerPoint, either-- we

00:48:38.680 --> 00:48:41.300
talked about Tableau, Sheets.

00:48:41.300 --> 00:48:43.360
There are many different
tools out there.

00:48:43.360 --> 00:48:46.070
And again, my view is that
any tool can be used well

00:48:46.070 --> 00:48:48.470
and any tool can be
used not so well.

00:48:48.470 --> 00:48:51.220
But pick a tool, get to know it
as best you can so it doesn't

00:48:51.220 --> 00:48:53.550
become a limiting factor when
it comes to applying some

00:48:53.550 --> 00:48:56.133
of the lessons that we've talked
about and some of the lessons

00:48:56.133 --> 00:48:58.680
covered in the book.

00:48:58.680 --> 00:49:00.860
DAVEY NICKELS: Cole,
if you were to do

00:49:00.860 --> 00:49:05.534
"Storytelling with Data v.
2" in 10 years or 20 years--

00:49:05.534 --> 00:49:07.700
I know it takes a lot of
time to write these books--

00:49:07.700 --> 00:49:08.700
what would it be on?

00:49:08.700 --> 00:49:10.366
Like would anything
change dramatically?

00:49:10.366 --> 00:49:11.340
Or what do you think?

00:49:11.340 --> 00:49:12.390
COLE NUSSBAUMER KNAFLIC: Yeah,
that's an interesting question.

00:49:12.390 --> 00:49:13.950
I used to always get
that question at Google

00:49:13.950 --> 00:49:16.050
as well of like, what's
data visualization 2.01?

00:49:16.050 --> 00:49:16.700
When is that coming?

00:49:16.700 --> 00:49:17.741
What does that look like?

00:49:17.741 --> 00:49:21.110
And for me, there isn't an
obvious sort of next one,

00:49:21.110 --> 00:49:24.090
because the concepts
that we talk about,

00:49:24.090 --> 00:49:25.220
they're fundamental.

00:49:25.220 --> 00:49:26.820
They should be used always.

00:49:26.820 --> 00:49:29.470
And as you get more
experience visualizing data,

00:49:29.470 --> 00:49:32.360
it's not that the way
you visualize it changes.

00:49:32.360 --> 00:49:34.510
I think it just becomes
more nuanced in how

00:49:34.510 --> 00:49:36.840
you apply some of the things
that we talk about here.

00:49:36.840 --> 00:49:40.700
So for me, there isn't an
obvious next iteration.

00:49:40.700 --> 00:49:41.320
But who knows?

00:49:41.320 --> 00:49:44.049
That may change after the
next 100 workshops or so.

00:49:44.049 --> 00:49:44.840
AUDIENCE: Hi, Cole.

00:49:48.490 --> 00:49:51.640
I teach a wonderful course
of data visualization here

00:49:51.640 --> 00:49:52.590
at Google.

00:49:52.590 --> 00:49:55.950
And so I teach Data Viz
1, which is pretty much

00:49:55.950 --> 00:49:58.550
focus on the first part of
your presentation today.

00:49:58.550 --> 00:50:01.444
I really loved the second
part of your presentation

00:50:01.444 --> 00:50:02.360
with the storytelling.

00:50:02.360 --> 00:50:03.800
I think it made perfect sense.

00:50:03.800 --> 00:50:06.700
And I think a lot of us could
benefit from learning these two

00:50:06.700 --> 00:50:09.410
things together, because
storytelling is obviously

00:50:09.410 --> 00:50:13.840
such an important part of
the overall lesson here.

00:50:13.840 --> 00:50:16.872
So it is this something that
we can steal with pride?

00:50:16.872 --> 00:50:18.705
I used to work with the
people of that team,

00:50:18.705 --> 00:50:21.570
so I would love to share
anything that's available.

00:50:21.570 --> 00:50:24.120
And I just think
a lot of Googlers

00:50:24.120 --> 00:50:26.450
will benefit with the second
part of this presentation

00:50:26.450 --> 00:50:26.951
today.

00:50:26.951 --> 00:50:28.700
COLE NUSSBAUMER KNAFLIC:
Yeah, absolutely.

00:50:28.700 --> 00:50:30.300
I mean, definitely
check out the book.

00:50:30.300 --> 00:50:33.140
Like I said, storytelling is
covered in much more depth

00:50:33.140 --> 00:50:33.760
there.

00:50:33.760 --> 00:50:35.301
Because the storytelling
piece really

00:50:35.301 --> 00:50:40.700
came in after the original
course here was developed.

00:50:40.700 --> 00:50:44.150
So there's not a lot
of that content there.

00:50:44.150 --> 00:50:47.610
But yeah, this is a space
where when you see something

00:50:47.610 --> 00:50:49.890
good or effective, steal it.

00:50:49.890 --> 00:50:51.820
Use it for your own use.

00:50:51.820 --> 00:50:54.137
There's no shame in that at all.

00:50:54.137 --> 00:50:55.970
And it's by practicing
these sorts of things

00:50:55.970 --> 00:50:57.300
that we all get better.

00:50:57.300 --> 00:50:58.780
So yeah, absolutely.

00:50:58.780 --> 00:51:00.890
AUDIENCE: Cole, it is
so great to see you back

00:51:00.890 --> 00:51:03.030
at Google, as someone
who took the very

00:51:03.030 --> 00:51:04.720
early version of the course.

00:51:04.720 --> 00:51:08.820
And I knew this was
something special, which

00:51:08.820 --> 00:51:11.530
I wish the rest of
the world gets to see.

00:51:11.530 --> 00:51:13.950
And I know how passionate
you are about this topic.

00:51:13.950 --> 00:51:16.220
I'm so happy to see this coming.

00:51:16.220 --> 00:51:19.340
Thank you for taking the
time to come and talk to us.

00:51:19.340 --> 00:51:23.300
My question was
around-- this is just

00:51:23.300 --> 00:51:25.260
as much from the
organizational perspective.

00:51:25.260 --> 00:51:27.990
It's a skill, but it's
also the culture of just

00:51:27.990 --> 00:51:30.155
having so much focus on it.

00:51:30.155 --> 00:51:34.550
So as you speak with clients
from a variety of industries,

00:51:34.550 --> 00:51:36.760
what other type of
thing do you think we

00:51:36.760 --> 00:51:40.990
as employees or leaders
can do to kind of get

00:51:40.990 --> 00:51:43.780
a culture of having
focus on this aspect

00:51:43.780 --> 00:51:46.135
just as much as anything
else, like dad infrastructure

00:51:46.135 --> 00:51:47.430
or anything else?

00:51:47.430 --> 00:51:50.179
What can we do to get this
message out in the world?

00:51:50.179 --> 00:51:51.845
COLE NUSSBAUMER
KNAFLIC: Yeah, so Google

00:51:51.845 --> 00:51:53.136
is already taking steps, right?

00:51:53.136 --> 00:51:55.090
The fact that there is
a data viz course here

00:51:55.090 --> 00:51:58.800
and that it's made
widely available sort of

00:51:58.800 --> 00:52:02.430
proves that there is an appetite
for this and the resources

00:52:02.430 --> 00:52:03.820
for it, which is awesome.

00:52:03.820 --> 00:52:06.550
I think when it comes to
propelling that even further

00:52:06.550 --> 00:52:08.590
and embedding it
throughout the culture,

00:52:08.590 --> 00:52:11.140
it's about recognizing
when it's done well

00:52:11.140 --> 00:52:13.700
and promoting that
when it's done well,

00:52:13.700 --> 00:52:17.180
when there are good
examples, really highlighting

00:52:17.180 --> 00:52:19.382
those to other people
and making it a goal.

00:52:19.382 --> 00:52:20.840
It's always been
interesting to me,

00:52:20.840 --> 00:52:22.680
because if you think of the
entire analytical process,

00:52:22.680 --> 00:52:24.927
you start off with a
question or a hypothesis.

00:52:24.927 --> 00:52:26.010
Then you collect the data.

00:52:26.010 --> 00:52:27.257
Then you clean the data.

00:52:27.257 --> 00:52:28.340
Then you analyze the data.

00:52:28.340 --> 00:52:29.930
And at that point,
you can get away

00:52:29.930 --> 00:52:33.360
with just throwing it in
a graph and being done.

00:52:33.360 --> 00:52:37.300
Where the graph is the only
part of that entire process

00:52:37.300 --> 00:52:39.110
that your audience ever sees.

00:52:39.110 --> 00:52:41.410
So my view has always been
it deserves at least as

00:52:41.410 --> 00:52:44.620
much time and attention
as the other parts.

00:52:44.620 --> 00:52:48.070
So I think as you have more
examples internally of people

00:52:48.070 --> 00:52:50.550
doing that well, that you
can sort of hold up and say,

00:52:50.550 --> 00:52:52.720
here, this is what
we should emulate,

00:52:52.720 --> 00:52:55.890
it starts building a culture
around that over time.

00:52:55.890 --> 00:52:59.050
And investing in people when
it comes to the training,

00:52:59.050 --> 00:53:02.220
developing internal experts
to whom others can turn,

00:53:02.220 --> 00:53:03.840
all of these things
can help sort

00:53:03.840 --> 00:53:07.070
of continue that
positive momentum.

00:53:07.070 --> 00:53:09.070
TINA MALM: And with
that, thank you so much.

00:53:09.070 --> 00:53:10.528
COLE NUSSBAUMER
KNAFLIC: Thank you.

00:53:10.528 --> 00:53:13.620
[APPLAUSE]
