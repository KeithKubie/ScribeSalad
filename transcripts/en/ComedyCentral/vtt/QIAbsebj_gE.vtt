You guys have caught me,
literally,

00:00:01.701 --> 00:00:04.771 line:68%
last moment off
of the last scene on set.

00:00:04.804 --> 00:00:07.240 line:64%
I can't really process it yet.

00:00:07.273 --> 00:00:10.243 line:68%
Do you want to,
let's take a last look with me?

00:00:12.178 --> 00:00:14.547 line:68%
All right, we're going to go in
for the last time.

00:00:16.215 --> 00:00:17.417
Okay.
Let's go.

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:18.584
Bittersweet.
Okay.

00:00:18.617 --> 00:00:22.255 line:92%
Let's do it.

00:00:22.288 --> 00:00:24.691 line:92%
Oh my God, this is really sad.

00:00:25.324 --> 00:00:27.593
This is me, this is my artwork
from college.

00:00:27.626 --> 00:00:29.595
Like real artwork
but they, it's a print.

00:00:29.628 --> 00:00:30.763 line:92%
You guys like scanned it-

00:00:30.796 --> 00:00:31.864 line:92%
Yeah.

00:00:31.897 --> 00:00:33.099
... and there's another one
of these in my bedroom.

00:00:33.132 --> 00:00:35.701
Yeah 'cause originally we had
some of your actual things.

00:00:35.734 --> 00:00:37.303
Oh my gosh yeah.
The markers was like yours.

00:00:37.336 --> 00:00:38.438 line:92%
Oh yes.

00:00:38.471 --> 00:00:39.506
Yes.
When we borrowed it.

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:41.274
When we get in there
my bedroom is like so mine.

00:00:41.307 --> 00:00:42.275
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

00:00:42.308 --> 00:00:44.277
In the hurricane episode
there's like this little

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:46.846
close up of these little dudes
having their moment.

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:49.582
You know this story.
This is unbelievable.

00:00:49.615 --> 00:00:52.218
I bought a rug, okay,
in my personal living room

00:00:52.251 --> 00:00:53.186 line:92%
and I was like,

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.222
"Guys I really want Abbi
to have a new rug."

00:00:56.255 --> 00:00:58.124
And like just a couple
new things to be like,

00:00:58.157 --> 00:00:59.192 line:92%
"Oh she's like older now."

00:00:59.225 --> 00:01:01.694
I try to differentiate myself
from the character

00:01:01.727 --> 00:01:03.796
and I come in here
and I was like,

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:08.401
"That's my fucking carpet."
Of all the rugs in all the world

00:01:09.502 --> 00:01:11.170
they bought
the same carpet as me.

00:01:11.203 --> 00:01:12.338 line:92%
Yeah.

00:01:12.371 --> 00:01:14.674
It makes me almost upset
because I'm like,

00:01:14.707 --> 00:01:16.375 line:92%
"I'm her. I'm just her."

00:01:16.408 --> 00:01:20.446
This is my brother and my dad in
real life at the Grand Canyon.

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:24.684
Melody is a teeny Easter egg
that we don't pay off ever.

00:01:25.751 --> 00:01:29.856
All the teeny little touches
are what makes it feel so real.

00:01:29.889 --> 00:01:31.824
I think that's the fun part
kind of like trying

00:01:31.857 --> 00:01:34.861
to evolve the sets to match
like what you guys are up to.

00:01:35.761 --> 00:01:39.565
Want to go in here?
This is crazy right?

00:01:39.598 --> 00:01:41.367 line:92%
I don't feel like it's real.

00:01:41.834 --> 00:01:45.705
So I mean we changed the layout
in here too last season.

00:01:45.738 --> 00:01:47.406
Like four was like
a big transition

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:51.444
so the bed was in this corner
for the first three seasons.

00:01:52.178 --> 00:01:53.913
This color of this room
is crazy.

00:01:53.946 --> 00:01:55.681
But yeah it's Guava
if anybody wants to know.

00:01:55.714 --> 00:01:56.849 line:92%
It's Guava.

00:01:56.882 --> 00:01:58.284 line:92%
Watermelon and the-

00:01:58.317 --> 00:01:59.385 line:92%
It's very guava.

00:01:59.418 --> 00:02:02.655
Yeah wait this is the thing
in my actual apartment

00:02:02.688 --> 00:02:06.259
that I had with markers
just like this.

00:02:06.292 --> 00:02:08.461
And this is like
the recreation of your chair.

00:02:08.494 --> 00:02:10.697 line:92%
Yeah so this is crazy.

00:02:11.363 --> 00:02:13.866
First the pilot
we brough in my chair,

00:02:13.899 --> 00:02:18.271
like all this stuff and then
they recreated this chair

00:02:18.304 --> 00:02:21.440
that's like a very mid century
retro-y vibe.

00:02:21.473 --> 00:02:23.843
It looks so good. Like this
is not a chair that exists.

00:02:23.876 --> 00:02:25.278 line:92%
And I might cry right now,

00:02:25.311 --> 00:02:29.582
but literally you two
have like made the show.

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.488
Like you have made the tone
of the look of every space

00:02:35.521 --> 00:02:37.690
that we've entered people
like want our stuff

00:02:37.723 --> 00:02:40.593
and they copy our shit
and it feels real

00:02:40.626 --> 00:02:42.261
and you have made
the characters feel

00:02:42.294 --> 00:02:45.431 line:92%
so fully fleshed out and honest

00:02:45.464 --> 00:02:47.366
and like they actually live
in New York City

00:02:47.399 --> 00:02:48.668
and so thank you guys.
Really.

00:02:48.701 --> 00:02:49.736 line:92%
I'm gonna cry too.

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:52.906
For putting your whole selves
into this really.

00:02:54.873 --> 00:02:56.176 line:92%
It's been a (laughs)
