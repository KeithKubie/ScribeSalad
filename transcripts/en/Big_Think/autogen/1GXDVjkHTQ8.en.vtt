right you're simply including them in
 

00:38:25.740 --> 00:38:27.380
right you're simply including them in
that activity and I think that they

00:38:27.380 --> 00:38:27.390
that activity and I think that they
 

00:38:27.390 --> 00:38:29.510
that activity and I think that they
absorb a heck of a lot more from that

00:38:29.510 --> 00:38:29.520
absorb a heck of a lot more from that
 

00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:32.120
