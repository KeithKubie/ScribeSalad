00:00:00.363 --> 00:00:03.103
- [Voiceover] In the last video,
we factored this polynomial

00:00:03.103 --> 00:00:04.660
in order to find the real roots.

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:06.388
We factored it by grouping,

00:00:06.388 --> 00:00:08.606
which essentially doing
the distributive property

00:00:08.606 --> 00:00:10.139
in reverse twice.

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:11.984
And I mentioned that there's
two ways you could do it.

00:00:11.984 --> 00:00:13.772
You could actually, from the get go,

00:00:13.772 --> 00:00:16.534
add these two middle degree terms,

00:00:16.534 --> 00:00:19.192
and then, think about it from there.

00:00:19.192 --> 00:00:20.888
So, what I thought I'd
do is just a quick video

00:00:20.888 --> 00:00:22.908
on that alternative.

00:00:22.908 --> 00:00:26.387
So, if we add, instead of grouping,

00:00:26.387 --> 00:00:29.011
if we add these middle two terms.

00:00:29.011 --> 00:00:30.787
Actually, I'll just focus

00:00:30.787 --> 00:00:32.436
on the fourth degree polynomial here.

00:00:32.436 --> 00:00:34.247
We know that we have an x out front.

00:00:36.591 --> 00:00:41.050
This fourth degree polynomial
is going to simplify to

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.017
x to the fourth

00:00:44.017 --> 00:00:46.886
plus seven x squared

00:00:50.005 --> 00:00:51.306
minus 18.

00:00:54.664 --> 00:00:58.331
If we wanna factor this, we
could recognize a pattern here.

00:00:59.323 --> 00:01:00.762
You probably remember.

00:01:00.762 --> 00:01:01.691
Hopefully you remember.

00:01:01.691 --> 00:01:03.109
If you don't, then you might wanna review

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:04.108
your factoring polynomials.

00:01:04.108 --> 00:01:06.209
But if you have x plus a

00:01:06.209 --> 00:01:08.624
times x plus b,

00:01:08.624 --> 00:01:10.288
that's going to be equal to,

00:01:10.288 --> 00:01:14.548
x is going to be equal to x squared plus

00:01:14.548 --> 00:01:16.951
the sum of those two numbers, a and b,

00:01:16.951 --> 00:01:18.751
as being the coefficient of the x term

00:01:18.751 --> 00:01:20.411
plus the product of those two numbers.

00:01:20.411 --> 00:01:22.628
If you just multiply this out,

00:01:22.628 --> 00:01:24.126
this is what you would get.

00:01:24.126 --> 00:01:28.827
But if this was x squared
plus a times x squared plus b,

00:01:28.827 --> 00:01:30.119
instead of this being x squared,

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.701
this would be x to the fourth.

00:01:31.701 --> 00:01:34.232
Instead of this being x,
this would be x squared,

00:01:34.232 --> 00:01:36.913
which is exactly the pattern we have here.

00:01:36.913 --> 00:01:39.978
So, what two a's and b's
that if I add them up,

00:01:39.978 --> 00:01:41.894
I would get seven,

00:01:41.894 --> 00:01:43.241
and if I were to take their product,

00:01:44.633 --> 00:01:47.844
I get negative 18?

00:01:48.314 --> 00:01:49.977
Well, since their product
is negative, we know

00:01:49.977 --> 00:01:51.519
that they are of different signs.

00:01:51.519 --> 00:01:53.655
One will be positive,
one will be negative.

00:01:53.655 --> 00:01:55.664
And since their sum is positive, we know

00:01:55.664 --> 00:01:57.823
that the larger of the two numbers

00:01:57.823 --> 00:02:00.238
is going to be positive.

00:02:00.238 --> 00:02:03.953
So, what jumps out at me is nine times

00:02:03.953 --> 00:02:05.102
negative two.

00:02:05.102 --> 00:02:06.774
You multiply those, you get negative 18.

00:02:06.774 --> 00:02:08.933
You take their sum, you get seven.

00:02:08.933 --> 00:02:12.334
So, we can rewrite this, just
looking at this pattern here

00:02:12.334 --> 00:02:15.956
as x squared plus nine

00:02:15.956 --> 00:02:19.624
times x squared minus two.

00:02:19.624 --> 00:02:21.203
I could say plus negative two.

00:02:21.203 --> 00:02:23.199
That's the same thing
as x squared minus two.

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:24.999
And then, that's exactly what we got

00:02:26.332 --> 00:02:28.226
right over here.

00:02:28.226 --> 00:02:29.759
Of course, you have this x out front

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:31.546
that I didn't consider right over here.

00:02:31.546 --> 00:02:33.798
And then, this, as we did
in the previous video,

00:02:33.798 --> 00:02:37.246
you could recognize as
a difference of squares

00:02:37.246 --> 00:02:40.356
and then, factor it further
to actually find the roots.

00:02:40.356 --> 00:02:42.539
But I just wanted to show
that you could solve this

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:46.672
by regrouping, or you can solve this by,

00:02:46.672 --> 00:02:49.678
I guess you could say, more
traditional factoring means.

00:02:49.678 --> 00:02:52.534
And notice this nine and negative two,

00:02:52.534 --> 00:02:54.450
this is what was already broken up for us,

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.446
so we could factor by regrouping.
