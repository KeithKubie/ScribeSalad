00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:28.810
ELIZABETH CHOE: So we have been
talking a lot about, sort of,

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:32.270
the theory of things,
but I know you guys

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.600
want to get into the practice.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.110
At the end of
class, we have a lot

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:37.892
of plastic elements
in the back that Ceri

00:00:37.892 --> 00:00:39.100
will help you guys check out.

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.502
Some cameras, mics,
headphones, tripods.

00:00:41.502 --> 00:00:43.210
If you guys want to
just use your iPhones

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:47.080
for tonight's assignment,
that's totally fine as well.

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.410
Chris brought up a lot of really
good points of just framing,

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:51.760
practicalities of filming.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.485
I do want you to consider,
though, that web video breaks

00:00:55.485 --> 00:00:57.320
a lot of these rules as well.

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.590
So you'll notice that Sideshow
doesn't do the rule of thirds

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.000
framing at all.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.120
Hankering just--

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.190
AUDIENCE: All rules
are made to be broken.

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:07.960
ELIZABETH CHOE: Yes, yes.

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.740
But he does that
very intentionally.

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.380
A lot of it is because--
the way his videos go,

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.970
he'll look to the side and
a little image will pop up.

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.280
So I think part of what he
does that is to leave room

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.370
for some of those visuals.

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:23.510
And Vsauce does it because
he's just super up-close.

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:25.260
It's a little weird
to do a rule of thirds

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.910
when you're so up-close because
you don't have a background

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:29.440
to get rid of so much.

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.080
So don't feel like you
have to adhere to a rule

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:33.830
just because we said,
you have to do this,

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:34.790
you have to do this.

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:36.360
Thoughtfulness is
one of the values,

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.036
so as long as you justify
it in your reflection

00:01:39.036 --> 00:01:42.530
or in your assignments
somehow, it's totally fine.

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.024
So for today's assignment, in
addition to the two readings

00:01:47.024 --> 00:01:49.315
that are online-- and don't
worry, they're pretty short

00:01:49.315 --> 00:01:52.130
and they're fun-- we're
going to have you guys make

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:57.211
a video on, basically, a circus
sideshow pitch about a video

00:01:57.211 --> 00:01:59.710
that you're eventually going
to make for your final project.

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:01.390
And it's OK if this
ends up changing,

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:03.598
it's just an exercise to
get you guys started, to get

00:02:03.598 --> 00:02:05.280
you familiar with the camera.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.740
Don't worry about doing crazy
camera moves or anything.

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:11.570
If all you want to do tonight
is to set up your tripod

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:14.899
and mic up, and deliver your
pitch, that's totally fine.

00:02:14.899 --> 00:02:16.440
We just want you
guys to get familiar

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.200
with all the equipment.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.140
But, basically, it is going
to be selling an idea or topic

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.520
about science, technology,
engineering, or math that

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.730
should convince someone to want
to watch your eventual video.

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.650
And again, it's OK if
you change the idea.

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.470
I do want you guys to brainstorm
three ideas in addition

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.350
to the pitch video
that you make.

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:40.130
You don't have to post them
online or write them down.

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:43.150
Just have them in your
head for class tomorrow

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.040
because we're going to have some
very special guests speakers

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.150
first thing tomorrow, who will
help you with these pitches.

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.890
So to give you an idea
of the type of thing

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.560
that we're looking for.

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.740
Again, don't necessarily
copy this video exactly.

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.580
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.644
-What is the most
astounding fact

00:03:07.644 --> 00:03:09.560
that you can share with
us about the universe?

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.660
-The most astounding fact--

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:16.100
-The most astounding fact.

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:22.910
- --is the knowledge that
the atoms that comprise life

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:24.020
on earth.

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:27.810
The atoms that make
up the human body

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:32.010
are traceable to
the crucibles that

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:38.440
cooked light elements into
heavy elements in their core,

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.580
under extreme temperatures
and pressures.

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:44.500
These stars, the high
mass ones among them,

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.960
went unstable in
their later years.

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:49.670
They collapsed
and then exploded,

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:55.150
scattering their enriched
guts across the galaxy.

00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:00.730
Guts made of carbon,
nitrogen, oxygen,

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:03.760
and all the fundamental
ingredients of life itself.

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.880
These ingredients become part
of gas clouds that condense.

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:08.720
Collapse.

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.810
Form the next generation
of solar systems,

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:14.170
stars with orbiting planets.

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:18.005
And those planets now have the
ingredients for life itself.

00:04:20.589 --> 00:04:23.570
So when I look up at
the night sky-- and I

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:28.390
know that yes, we are
part of this universe.

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:32.020
We are in this
universe, but perhaps

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.370
more important than
both of those facts,

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.990
is that the universe is in us.

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:42.628
When I reflect on
that fact, I look up--

00:04:42.628 --> 00:04:44.503
many people feel small,
because they're small

00:04:44.503 --> 00:04:48.120
and the universe is
big-- but I feel big.

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:54.000
Because my atoms came
from those stars.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:54.667
[END PLAYBACK]

00:04:54.667 --> 00:04:56.250
ELIZABETH CHOE: So
obviously you don't

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:58.900
have to do a super dramatic
thing like Neil deGrasse

00:04:58.900 --> 00:04:59.800
Tyson did.

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.216
Again, don't feel like you
have to go home and contemplate

00:05:02.216 --> 00:05:05.240
on life's mysteries, and
how evolution is just

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:07.200
this beautiful thing
that happens on earth,

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.826
and it's an amazing
thing or whatever.

00:05:09.826 --> 00:05:11.450
But the reason why
I wanted to show you

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:15.150
that video is because the actual
plastic elements of making that

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:16.570
were pretty straightforward.

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:18.580
Pretty simple, just two
cameras on a tripod.

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:20.020
Nothing too crazy.

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:23.400
But he still, hopefully,
manages to engage you somewhat.

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:25.822
I mean, I personally
wanted to keep watching,

00:05:25.822 --> 00:05:26.780
keep learning about it.

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:29.700
That's partially because
of his persona, which

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:31.070
some people find off-putting.

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:34.670
So again, it's a
matter of taste.

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:36.900
What he does here
is just, sort of,

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:40.210
rattle off this theme
of-- I think the thesis

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:43.040
of this whole conversation
that they have is

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:45.417
that you take this
misconception that we all

00:05:45.417 --> 00:05:47.000
think that we're
part of the universe,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.970
but really the universe, and
all the things that make it up,

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:52.160
are inside of us.

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:55.360
He has this sort
of fact, or nugget,

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:58.410
that he builds upon to
create this bigger narrative.

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:01.750
All right, so for Science
Out Loud, George and I

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:03.990
just did an episode on snot.

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:06.520
And the way we
started it way was--

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:08.830
one of my former professors
here, Katharina Ribbeck.

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:11.715
Her lab studies mucus, and
I was reading about her

00:06:11.715 --> 00:06:13.360
in Popular Science,
because she just

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:15.397
got this big feature in it.

00:06:15.397 --> 00:06:16.980
And one of the facts
they talked about

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:20.310
was that your body produces
over a gallon of mucus a day,

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:22.890
which I thought was, like--
how does that happen?

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:23.740
That's disgusting.

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:27.510
We think of snot as the stuff
that oozes out of us when we're

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:30.380
sick, and the stuff that
we blow out into tissues

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:31.440
and throw away.

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:34.190
But actually it's so
important that our body makes

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:35.850
over a gallon of it a day.

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:38.180
And that it does more than
just come out of our nose

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:40.210
when we're sick or
when we're crying.

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:42.762
That it's doing things,
like providing moisture

00:06:42.762 --> 00:06:45.220
for our bodies, which doesn't
sound like a big deal, right?

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:47.240
Until you think about
your body without mucus.

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:49.156
That your eyes would dry
out, and you wouldn't

00:06:49.156 --> 00:06:51.810
be able to swallow because your
esophagus would get ripped up

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:53.690
every time you tried
to eat something.

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:56.970
And then you think of mucus of
being more than just this sort

00:06:56.970 --> 00:07:00.630
of bodily waste that
comes out of you,

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:04.920
but really this amazing
thing that takes care of you

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:07.130
in a way that's so
important that you

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:09.390
make over gallon of it a day.

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:12.220
And that sort of
became the pitch

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:15.800
the circus sideshow, step
right up type of thing that

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:18.330
informed the rest of our video.

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:19.870
And so that's the
kind of thing I

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:22.490
want you guys to be
thinking about tonight,

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:23.930
and want you guys to record.

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:28.830
Now we very well could have had
you guys just write a pitch,

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:31.207
but I think it would be
more fun to make a video.

00:07:31.207 --> 00:07:32.790
I mean, I think it's
good for you guys

00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:35.370
to get used to using the cameras
and the plastic elements.

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:40.380
So again don't worry
about-- are my camera

00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:41.340
movements good enough?

00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:43.839
You don't even have to move the
camera if you don't want to.

00:07:43.839 --> 00:07:45.960
Feel free to play around
with it if you want.

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:50.200
But really focus on clarity
for this assignment.

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:52.490
So set up the camera
in such a way,

00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:54.050
and set up the
lighting in such a way

00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:55.874
that you're very
clearly visible.

00:07:55.874 --> 00:07:58.040
We are going to give you
these little lavalier mics,

00:07:58.040 --> 00:07:59.860
so make sure that your
audio's very clear.

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:03.390
Those are going to be the
priorities for this assignment.

00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:05.690
And then make your
pitch very engaging,

00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:07.885
and think of three backup
ideas just in case.

00:08:07.885 --> 00:08:10.824
Does that sound good?

00:08:10.824 --> 00:08:11.990
I had one more example, too.

00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:12.360
We can show it.

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:13.026
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:08:13.026 --> 00:08:14.590
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:18.815
-Hello, this is Hank Green,
and welcome to SciShow.

00:08:18.815 --> 00:08:21.440
You might have noticed I talk a
lot about how great plants are.

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:22.590
And why shouldn't I?

00:08:22.590 --> 00:08:23.930
They're autotrophs.

00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:26.820
They can harness the raw,
untamed power of the sun

00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:28.700
and use it to make
food for themselves.

00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:29.980
Pretty impressive.

00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:31.330
So why can't animals do it?

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:33.459
Well oddly enough,
some of them do.

00:08:33.459 --> 00:08:35.250
And in just the past
few years, researchers

00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:36.710
have been discovering
animals that

00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:39.720
seem to be able to harvest
sunlight for energy.

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:42.720
Take for instance, the eastern
emerald elysia, a sea slug that

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:44.220
looks like a big floating leaf.

00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:46.500
It lives along the East
Coast of the United States,

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:49.150
where it just hangs out eating
a specific kind of yellow-green

00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:49.560
al--

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:49.970
[END PLAYBACK]

00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:51.230
ELIZABETH CHOE: So I
just wanted to show

00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:53.189
you that as an example
of a style and delivery.

00:08:53.189 --> 00:08:55.230
It's very different from
the Neil deGrasse Tyson,

00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:57.740
but again, same concept.

00:08:57.740 --> 00:09:00.040
So don't feel like you have
to be Neil deGrasse Tyson.

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:02.581
Don't feel like you have to be
Hank Green and talk like this,

00:09:02.581 --> 00:09:06.081
and jump back and forth between,
like, closeup and wide screen.

00:09:06.081 --> 00:09:07.580
But hopefully that
gives you an idea

00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:09.163
of what you guys
need to make tonight.

00:09:09.163 --> 00:09:12.130
If you guys have any questions,
I'll stick around after class.

00:09:12.130 --> 00:09:13.800
You can always email me too.

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:18.570
So for tonight,
stem pitch video.

00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:20.200
Ceri's going to
come and talk now

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:23.100
about what that process
exactly looks like.

00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:27.057
But basically, always
look at the online version

00:09:27.057 --> 00:09:29.640
of the syllabus, because I might
tweak some things day to day,

00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:32.650
but the stuff for day one is
totally up-to-date right now.

00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:35.840
You'll post yours stem pitch
to Tumblr with the hashtag

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:39.400
"dayonepitch" and a hashtag
of your Kerberos ID,

00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:42.020
so that's-- all
the SUTD students,

00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:44.005
you guys have an MIT ID, right?

00:09:44.005 --> 00:09:46.214
OK, so it's just your username.

00:09:46.214 --> 00:09:47.630
And then you'll
post a daily blog,

00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:48.740
and that's going to
happen every day.

00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:50.670
Just reflections of
what happened in class.

00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:52.419
If you want to take
pictures during class,

00:09:52.419 --> 00:09:55.150
if you want to record video
tomorrow, feel free to.

00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:58.051
Tomorrow will be a great day
to record video, just saying.

00:09:58.051 --> 00:10:00.330
And then there are
two readings that I'd

00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:04.100
like you guys to annotate on
Annotation Studio, which Ceri's

00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:05.820
going to show you
right now, as well.

00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:09.250
And then just bring three other
pitch ideas to class tomorrow.

00:10:09.250 --> 00:10:12.440
Did everyone get the email
about class timing shifted up

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:13.650
tomorrow?

00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:17.519
So if you guys want
to show up at 12:10,

00:10:17.519 --> 00:10:19.060
that would be good,
because our guest

00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:21.590
lecturers are coming at 12:15.

00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:24.640
And we'll end class
at 3:15 tomorrow.

00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:26.650
CERI RILEY: This is
Annotation Studio.

00:10:26.650 --> 00:10:29.320
It's on annotationstudio.org
and it's

00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:32.630
where you're going to be doing
your reading assignments.

00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:36.010
So what you need to do is
just go to the website.

00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:38.180
Click sign up for sign in.

00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:40.640
And it's a really easy
registration form.

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:43.940
First name, last name,
email, I use my MIT email.

00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:46.620
Affiliation, just put MIT.

00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:48.020
And a password.

00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:49.659
And the most important
thing, so you

00:10:49.659 --> 00:10:51.450
can get the assignments
in the first place,

00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:53.610
is to type in the class.

00:10:53.610 --> 00:10:57.590
So you just need to
do 20219, press Enter,

00:10:57.590 --> 00:11:02.030
and it'll be blue, to like,
confirm that you're in it.

00:11:02.030 --> 00:11:04.300
Read and accept the terms
of service, check that box,

00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:05.960
and register.

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:10.085
And so I'll show you
what it looks like.

00:11:13.510 --> 00:11:17.029
So this is what you'll
see when you sign in.

00:11:17.029 --> 00:11:18.570
You won't have any
created documents,

00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:21.920
but you'll have
assigned documents.

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:24.720
The two that we want
you to read and annotate

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:27.620
are the first two-- "You Can't
Make It on YouTube Anymore,"

00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:29.580
and "This Will
Revolutionize Education."

00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:32.100
You'll click on it,
and it'll bring you

00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:34.530
to the document itself.

00:11:34.530 --> 00:11:36.780
So for example, this
is the first one.

00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:40.410
And you'll be able to read
along and highlight it, and add

00:11:40.410 --> 00:11:42.390
in your thoughts
as you go along.

00:11:42.390 --> 00:11:45.850
So for example,
you're reading it.

00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:47.820
You're reading about
Hank Green, and how he

00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:50.200
was invited to New TeeVee Live.

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:52.380
I was starting my own
online media conference,

00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:54.930
and maybe you're thinking,
well what is that?

00:11:54.930 --> 00:11:59.640
So you can say, does anyone--

00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:03.560
[TYPING]

00:12:06.510 --> 00:12:10.790
And then add some tags.

00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:13.870
I don't know what tags really
do, but then everyone can see

00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:16.590
that annotation and who did it.

00:12:16.590 --> 00:12:18.880
And I'm not sure, because
we haven't played around

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:20.450
with this software too
much, but you probably

00:12:20.450 --> 00:12:22.616
will be able to comment on
each other's annotations.

00:12:22.616 --> 00:12:25.790
So if for some reason someone
poses a question like this,

00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:28.030
and someone knows the
answer, it's Vid Con.

00:12:28.030 --> 00:12:29.380
Then they can respond.

00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:31.079
You can add pictures,
you can add links.

00:12:31.079 --> 00:12:32.870
And it's just really
handy because then you

00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:35.925
can see people's idea flows as
they go through the document.

00:12:35.925 --> 00:12:37.508
ELIZABETH CHOE: Just
so you guys know,

00:12:37.508 --> 00:12:40.926
we're grading the annotation
just on a three point scale.

00:12:40.926 --> 00:12:44.030
If you put effort into
it, you put marginal,

00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:45.820
if you did it at all.

00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:49.060
Don't feel like that you have to
spend hours and hours on this.

00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:53.620
These readings are pretty fun, I
mean, one was posted on Medium.

00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:56.488
It's not a super dry
academic platform.

00:12:56.488 --> 00:12:58.400
And the other one's
a YouTube video.

00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:00.600
So just respond honestly.

00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:05.132
Don't feel like we're expecting
huge analyses of these,

00:13:05.132 --> 00:13:08.450
but we do want to see you
guys creating it and taking

00:13:08.450 --> 00:13:10.350
[INAUDIBLE].

00:13:10.350 --> 00:13:14.650
CERI RILEY: OK, the other thing
I was going to show you guys.

00:13:14.650 --> 00:13:19.900
How many of you have used
Tumblr before as a platform?

00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:22.060
OK, so a couple.

00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:27.180
So that's going to be our main
blog, I guess, for this class.

00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:31.420
I've sent you guys all an email
invitation to join the website

00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:34.100
and be able to use it.

00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:35.930
This is what the
main website looks

00:13:35.930 --> 00:13:39.720
like, you should have already
looked at it earlier today.

00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:41.420
The main things
are that there are

00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:44.120
links on this top bar to the
stellar, which we probably

00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:47.180
won't use, Annotation
Studio, and an ask box.

00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:51.130
And so I'll be on the Tumblr
monitoring it all the time.

00:13:51.130 --> 00:13:54.480
So you can ask questions there.

00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:56.580
There's lists of
all our Kerberoses,

00:13:56.580 --> 00:14:03.510
so we'll organize our
posts with your MIT ID.

00:14:03.510 --> 00:14:05.740
Then it's also
organized so you can

00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:08.910
look at specific assignments,
like day one, daily blogs,

00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:12.370
and things like that, which are
all sorted and dependent on you

00:14:12.370 --> 00:14:15.240
guys tagging your
posts correctly.

00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:17.280
And then there's also
reference material.

00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:19.330
This bottom tab on
the left side bar

00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:21.537
is probably most
useful for you guys.

00:14:21.537 --> 00:14:23.620
I can't scroll down right
now because there aren't

00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:26.280
enough posts, but it
has things like a list

00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:28.400
of all the assignments
that Elizabeth will post.

00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:32.990
Answered questions, and a
how to use Tumblr and upload

00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:35.870
videos on YouTube, which I'll
go through, hopefully, really

00:14:35.870 --> 00:14:39.600
quickly, so you guys don't
have to stay too long.

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:42.290
For those of you who haven't
used Tumblr, when you login,

00:14:42.290 --> 00:14:44.820
when you accept the
invitation to join the blog,

00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:45.860
it'll look like this.

00:14:45.860 --> 00:14:47.225
This is your dashboard.

00:14:47.225 --> 00:14:49.850
I have multiple accounts, and so
if you have multiple accounts,

00:14:49.850 --> 00:14:53.240
you have to go up here,
and choose MIT 219.

00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:56.150
And this is going to be
exactly what your dashboard is

00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:58.270
going to look like.

00:14:58.270 --> 00:15:03.270
And so, from here, you can
make different types of posts.

00:15:03.270 --> 00:15:07.990
We're probably going to use two
most often, text and a video.

00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:11.645
And so for a text post,
you just click Text post.

00:15:11.645 --> 00:15:12.645
You can give it a title.

00:15:16.967 --> 00:15:18.050
Put something in the body.

00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:30.692
And we request that you tag
things with specific names

00:15:30.692 --> 00:15:31.900
depending on the assignments.

00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:34.720
So Elizabeth gave
examples of what

00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:38.180
we want you to do for your
daily blogs, which is "day one",

00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:42.550
or whatever data is
and your MIT Kerberos.

00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:45.420
And so for example, if this
was my daily blog for today,

00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:48.780
I would type in "day
one", enter, and then

00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:50.425
my Kerberos, which is ceriley.

00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:57.320
And it'll be different
for your video

00:15:57.320 --> 00:16:01.360
that you end up
uploading to the site.

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:02.860
And you can include
images in this.

00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:05.740
You can include other things,
like links if need be,

00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:08.850
if you find that
necessary to your blog.

00:16:08.850 --> 00:16:10.000
And click Post.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.010
And then you should be
able to see it right here

00:16:12.010 --> 00:16:15.224
on your dashboard, and
also on the website

00:16:15.224 --> 00:16:16.140
if you go click there.

00:16:19.490 --> 00:16:25.000
OK so if you're making a
video post-- how many of you

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:29.830
have-- have any of you uploaded
a video to YouTube before?

00:16:29.830 --> 00:16:31.345
OK, this is more familiar.

00:16:31.345 --> 00:16:33.220
ELIZABETH CHOE: Is there
a way to just upload

00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:35.345
directly your files
to Tumblr, right?

00:16:35.345 --> 00:16:36.720
CERI RILEY: There
is, but there's

00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:38.372
a five minute limit per day.

00:16:38.372 --> 00:16:38.955
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:16:38.955 --> 00:16:42.420
So for tonight's
assignment, if you just

00:16:42.420 --> 00:16:44.895
want to upload your raw
video file to Tumblr,

00:16:44.895 --> 00:16:45.885
that's totally fine.

00:16:45.885 --> 00:16:49.350
But eventually, for
some of the drafts,

00:16:49.350 --> 00:16:51.840
you may need to
upload it to YouTube.

00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:55.410
CERI RILEY: So I'm just going to
go through this really briefly.

00:16:55.410 --> 00:16:57.780
YouTube.com.

00:16:57.780 --> 00:17:00.160
If you have a Gmail account,
you have a YouTube account

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:00.770
automatically.

00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:04.380
They're linked because
Google owns everything.

00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:06.930
Just click Upload in the
upper right hand corner.

00:17:06.930 --> 00:17:07.975
Select files to upload.

00:17:11.010 --> 00:17:15.829
I have an example video
that I shot this morning.

00:17:15.829 --> 00:17:17.622
OK, so here you have
basic information.

00:17:17.622 --> 00:17:18.580
You can choose a title.

00:17:21.810 --> 00:17:22.393
A description.

00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:30.780
And this is-- you can tag
it with anything you want.

00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:33.230
This is the key part,
I think, to YouTube,

00:17:33.230 --> 00:17:35.149
is where-- how you
want to upload it.

00:17:35.149 --> 00:17:37.440
So public means anyone can
search it through the search

00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:38.648
bar, through Google searches.

00:17:38.648 --> 00:17:40.520
It'll be available
to the public.

00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:42.980
Private means you have to
enter certain email addresses,

00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:44.605
and those are the
people who can access

00:17:44.605 --> 00:17:46.640
it using their Gmail accounts.

00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:49.340
I like doing unlisted
personally because then,

00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:51.880
if you have the link to the
video, you can access it.

00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:56.760
But if you don't have the link
to the video, you can't see it.

00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:59.810
It keeps, like, my draft
videos like this one, no one

00:17:59.810 --> 00:18:01.410
will want to watch it.

00:18:01.410 --> 00:18:04.410
Eight seconds of me
talking to a phone camera.

00:18:04.410 --> 00:18:06.940
Private enough from, like,
the rest of the world.

00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:10.130
But you can still post the
link places, like the Tumblr,

00:18:10.130 --> 00:18:12.020
and have it be accessible.

00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:14.220
And so I like unlisted,
but you can do whatever

00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:16.370
you want with your videos.

00:18:16.370 --> 00:18:18.780
So you saw that the video
uploaded, and then it

00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:20.250
takes a little time to process.

00:18:20.250 --> 00:18:24.490
And that's just
YouTube doing things

00:18:24.490 --> 00:18:28.140
so that it can be played.

00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:28.940
That's my video.

00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:31.050
Now it's available, the
processing is really quick

00:18:31.050 --> 00:18:33.640
because it was eight seconds.

00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:40.350
And to upload on Tumblr, just
copy the URL or the embed code.

00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:42.350
Make a video post.

00:18:42.350 --> 00:18:44.550
Paste it in here.

00:18:44.550 --> 00:18:47.510
There's no thumbnail yet
because I haven't chosen one.

00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:50.950
YouTube sets one automatically
after a couple minutes.

00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:58.000
I can tag it with day one, and
my username, and set a caption.

00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:06.190
And post it.

00:19:06.190 --> 00:19:11.210
And it will appear on my
dashboard, and on the website.

00:19:11.210 --> 00:19:13.810
So this is just like
the general process.

00:19:13.810 --> 00:19:15.620
Under the References
tab on the Tumblr,

00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:18.000
there's more detailed if you
forget any of these steps.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.810
Or are having any
trouble, or feel free

00:19:19.810 --> 00:19:22.250
to email me at any time and
I could help troubleshoot

00:19:22.250 --> 00:19:24.236
any steps of this process.

00:19:24.236 --> 00:19:25.610
If you prefer
Vimeo, you can also

00:19:25.610 --> 00:19:28.624
upload it there and
just paste in the URL.

00:19:28.624 --> 00:19:30.040
If you already
have Vimeo account,

00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:32.500
or something like that.

00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:35.650
So I know we held you guys
to the last possible minute,

00:19:35.650 --> 00:19:38.250
so we'll let you
go ahead and go.

00:19:38.250 --> 00:19:41.320
ELIZABETH CHOE: If you
need any equipment tonight,

00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:45.085
Ceri and I will stick around and
check out stuff to you that you

00:19:45.085 --> 00:19:47.560
can keep for the month.

00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:49.940
If you want to just use
your iPhone tonight,

00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:51.130
that's also fine.

00:19:51.130 --> 00:19:53.575
Just make sure you're
lit well enough,

00:19:53.575 --> 00:19:56.207
and that we can hear you
well enough for tomorrow.

00:19:56.207 --> 00:19:58.790
And if you have any questions,
we'll stick around after class.

00:20:02.990 --> 00:20:06.040
So see you tomorrow at 12:10.
