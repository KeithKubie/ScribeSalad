1
00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:05,790
You are listening to
radiolab radio from w n y s

2
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:16,660
oh look, it's so it's hard to kill
another human being anymore, right?

3
00:00:16,661 --> 00:00:19,330
We, our fangs have
retreated, hands are weak.

4
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:22,600
But as we've lost this
ability to kill each other,

5
00:00:22,601 --> 00:00:27,601
we've gained an ability to read each
other's tone of voice and facial

6
00:00:27,851 --> 00:00:28,684
expression.

7
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:34,320
And often what's missing in these
interactions is one side of that equation.

8
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:36,610
Uh,

9
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:40,150
whether it's the police
not seeing somebody because
they're running through an

10
00:00:40,151 --> 00:00:41,330
alley with their gun drawn and,

11
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:46,350
and it's dark or shining a flashlight in
someone's face where that person can't

12
00:00:47,921 --> 00:00:49,300
see the officer's expression.

13
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:52,150
There's some mass cause
there's some breakdown in that,

14
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:53,830
in that equation that makes

15
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:58,330
handicaps us from a
normal human interaction.

16
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:04,570
Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad by him,
Robert Krulwich, this is Radiolab.

17
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:09,040
And today we are once again taking a deep
dive into Tampa Bay Times reporter Ben

18
00:01:09,041 --> 00:01:13,540
Montgomery's mountain of data
about police shootings in Florida.

19
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:15,460
So to refresh your memory from,

20
00:01:15,461 --> 00:01:19,630
so we've tried to account for every
single police shooting from January 1st of

21
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,790
2009 to um, December 31st of 2014.

22
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,820
And we've just to remind you,
Ben and [inaudible], his team

23
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:31,470
at the Tampa Bay Times collected
data from 828 police shootings.

24
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:34,590
And there's all kinds of stories
that you can tell about this data.

25
00:01:34,591 --> 00:01:39,591
Last week we looked at police training
and race and racism and obviously there's

26
00:01:40,051 --> 00:01:42,420
so much more than can and should
be said about all of that.

27
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:46,440
But this week we're going to go in a
very different direction. Maybe Matt,

28
00:01:46,441 --> 00:01:48,310
you just want to set this up for us. Yes.

29
00:01:48,311 --> 00:01:51,750
So we want to tell this story because
it actually plays out this, uh,

30
00:01:51,751 --> 00:01:54,900
this idea that Ben just mentioned that
there's this sort of communication

31
00:01:54,901 --> 00:01:59,190
breakdown that happens and it does it in
a very particular way because when one

32
00:01:59,191 --> 00:02:01,110
of these cases comes before a court,

33
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:04,890
the court more often than not will only
look at the moment that the cop involved

34
00:02:04,891 --> 00:02:08,640
in the shooting pulled their trigger.
You don't consider any other moment.

35
00:02:08,641 --> 00:02:11,580
It's only the objective facts
on the ground of the moment,

36
00:02:11,581 --> 00:02:13,830
the officer applies force.

37
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:18,330
So the thing that we found compelling
about this story is that in this case you

38
00:02:18,331 --> 00:02:21,900
can actually see, and kind of
a rare instance you can like,

39
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:25,920
as you can step in and see all the little
moments that lead up to that moment

40
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:30,600
and you realize how complicated
these interactions get.

41
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,840
So this particular story, it's
a story about white couple, uh,

42
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:38,520
Andrea and Rick Sheldon and we're actually
going to start the story with Rick.

43
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,150
So on one of my trips, uh, to Florida,

44
00:02:42,151 --> 00:02:45,780
Ben and I drove to the northeast corner
of the state of near Jacksonville to

45
00:02:45,781 --> 00:02:49,980
Rick's place. It's sorta like
the, the wilds of Florida.

46
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:53,040
Hi. How you doing Matt? Kielty
nice to meet you. Nice to meet you.

47
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,280
Like sort of thoughts that great wild.
Oh, that's a big bird back there.

48
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:58,440
What all, what all do
you have on the property?

49
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:00,220
Pretty much a little bit of everything.

50
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:04,030
He clicks rain water and barrels.
He's got potatoes, tomatoes, squash,

51
00:03:04,031 --> 00:03:07,780
these organic cartons, ducks,
goats, a lot of animals. Turkeys,

52
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:13,850
big turkeys. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. Oh,

53
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:16,590
a couple of dogs in the
house. Oh, you are so excited.

54
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:20,800
I'm gonna hit stop in
this case, the battery

55
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:29,650
[inaudible] uh, eventually we all
sit down and Rick's living room.

56
00:03:29,651 --> 00:03:33,610
Rick sat cross-legged on the couch. Um,
Rick, I was just wondering if we could,

57
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:36,730
uh, I pulled up a chair across from
him if we could talk about your case,

58
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:41,320
but even backing up before everything
happened, um, can you just tell me about,

59
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:44,940
about your, about your
wife? I met Andy. Um,

60
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:47,670
she was down here
visiting her mom and, uh,

61
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:52,210
we hit it off straight from the get
go. Where'd you, where'd you guys meet?

62
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:57,280
Tradewinds lounge. Downtown. St
Augustine. At a bar downtown? Yup. Yup.

63
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:02,490
What'd she look like? Oh, knock
out 10 dark dark hair. How tall?

64
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:07,140
Oh, short little thing. If I flipped
to you, make the first move a no,

65
00:04:07,141 --> 00:04:10,800
we kind of made the same move the same
time. And I can remember telling her,

66
00:04:10,801 --> 00:04:12,810
you know, we have a live burn tomorrow.

67
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:16,350
Rick was in China to be a firefighter at
the academy and one of our last events

68
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:21,090
and uh, that I'd call her whenever
I got done and we'd go have dinner.

69
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:25,230
She's like, no, you're not going to call
me. You just gonna come over. I'm like,

70
00:04:25,231 --> 00:04:27,240
I'm going to be stinky. She's like, nope.

71
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:29,580
Cause I know that if you
go back to your place,

72
00:04:29,581 --> 00:04:32,910
you're gonna pass out tired
and I'll never see you again,

73
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:36,000
so you're just going to come over here
and take a shower. And I showed up,

74
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:40,530
I ate dinner. So that was a date
number one? Yep. Pretty much.

75
00:04:40,531 --> 00:04:43,290
So Rick says they just, you
know, sort of connected.

76
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:47,370
And so the data for about a year,
she moved down here and then, um,

77
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:49,410
two of them got married and
she went to nursing school.

78
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:51,450
Later became a hospice nurse. Rick, uh,

79
00:04:51,451 --> 00:04:55,650
eventually became a firefighter for
Jackson fire rescue. If we were to, uh,

80
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:57,420
to jump ahead to the night in question,

81
00:04:57,570 --> 00:05:01,530
could you just like back up to like the
beginning of the day and just kind of

82
00:05:01,531 --> 00:05:06,260
walk me through? Yeah, we woke up
extra early. What Day is this? Um,

83
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:10,680
April the 15th. 2012 yeah.
Okay, so you woke up? Yeah.

84
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:14,490
Um, we were in at our cabin
and Georgia getting it ready,

85
00:05:14,491 --> 00:05:16,580
getting it all set up and whatnot and uh,

86
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:20,520
it was going to be a retirement
place anyway, packed up, came home,

87
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:25,410
long drive, long hot drive
when we got home, you know,

88
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:28,530
started unpacking the car a little bit
and started doing a little bit of this,

89
00:05:28,531 --> 00:05:28,980
that and the other,

90
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:31,980
doing a little bit chatting and talking
about dinner and having a couple of

91
00:05:31,981 --> 00:05:36,830
drinks, whatnot. What
happened after that? Now?

92
00:05:36,831 --> 00:05:37,664
I don't know.

93
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:42,390
We just kinda started getting grumpy
at each other and getting grumpy.

94
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,430
Now we talked about this for a while.

95
00:05:45,431 --> 00:05:48,500
I'm just wondering if you can
remember just kind of any detail of,

96
00:05:48,501 --> 00:05:53,110
of what you guys were talking about.
Um, and Rick didn't want to get into it.

97
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:54,880
I'd rather not make a
statement about that right now.

98
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,800
Just about the conversations
you guys were having.

99
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:59,350
I'd rather not make a statement
about that right now. Okay. Oh,

100
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:03,200
you can say according to the police
report is that Rick and Andy got into this

101
00:06:03,201 --> 00:06:06,260
screaming match and Rick says that
he felt himself shortness of breath,

102
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:08,540
chest pain, starting to kind of unravel,

103
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:11,030
lost a concentration and ability to think.

104
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:14,750
Rick says he's had problems
with PTSD for quite a while.

105
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:19,250
It goes back to his former
job as a paramedic. And I'm
like, I can't take this.

106
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:21,290
I need to walk away.

107
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:25,430
Grabbed a bottle out of the refrigerator
and I got in my truck and I went and I

108
00:06:25,431 --> 00:06:26,960
was like, okay, I'm just
going to go fishing.

109
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:29,630
Drove down this dirt road
for about five miles.

110
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:33,590
I went to the big pond down there, but
right over by the pond I was stuck.

111
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,960
His truck gets stuck in
the mud. I was axle deep.

112
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:39,410
So you opened up this bottle of
Tequila and he starts drinking.

113
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:43,130
He keeps drinking. Eventually
pop some pills, sleeping pills.

114
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:48,080
Next thing I remember was, um, you
know, um, I remember having problems.

115
00:06:48,081 --> 00:06:52,550
I remember being upset. I
remember having my, you know,

116
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:58,200
it's PTSD. It sucks. I remember,

117
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:02,810
um, calling my boss going,
hey, I need some help.

118
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:08,090
And, um, ask for help. Ask for, um,
employee assistance program help,

119
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:11,420
you know the suicide hotline. Oh,

120
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:14,270
you thought you were suicidal
in that moment? Um, no.

121
00:07:14,271 --> 00:07:17,990
I just thought I was losing it.
And in what way is it just like,

122
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:21,200
I'm just trying to put you off
digging. Yeah, stop digging.

123
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:25,160
You don't want to look in his
head. It gets that bad. Yeah.

124
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:32,480
Um, did he say anything to you? I
don't remember the conversation. Okay.

125
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:36,410
What happened after that? Um,
next thing I know I've got

126
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:39,790
the cops calling me going. Where are you?

127
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:41,110
Hello Richard.

128
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:42,860
This is recording that phone call.

129
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:48,190
Deputy Halston was sheriff's office.
I Bet I done. Hey, we're, uh,

130
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:50,060
we're trying to come out
here and help you. Um,

131
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,041
it's about 11,

132
00:07:51,041 --> 00:07:54,760
15 at night and deputy tells Rick that
he and a few other deputies are walking

133
00:07:54,761 --> 00:07:58,150
down this dirt road to Rick's place
because they'd gotten a call that Rick was

134
00:07:58,151 --> 00:08:00,730
possibly suicidal, that he'd
gotten into a fight with his wife.

135
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:02,590
Um, where are you at?

136
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,340
I have no idea though.

137
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:09,940
It tells the deputy that he got
in his truck, drove a ways away

138
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:14,970
until I got stopped and I opened
it and I've been enjoying myself.

139
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:19,600
Your wife had the house?
Yeah, it's still okay.

140
00:08:19,601 --> 00:08:23,860
Everything all right there at the
house. Everything's okay at the house.

141
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:28,640
Okay. We're mass to dispute. Can you

142
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:31,730
ws well can I get her phone number?
Cause he'd like to make contact with her.

143
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:35,130
We want to make sure everybody's safe
cause you know we got deputies out here.

144
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,061
It's dark, you know,

145
00:08:36,061 --> 00:08:38,140
and we don't want her to think that
we're somebody proud and stuff.

146
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,590
So when we want her to know
it was worse, so hoppy,

147
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:44,490
I was the best way we can make
contact while her eight, two, three,

148
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:46,630
Rick gives the deputy
his home phone number.

149
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:50,730
You write this down. All
right. Okay. So we're gonna,

150
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:56,250
we're going to try to make contact
with heart and then um, um,

151
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:57,570
I must be on the phone with you.

152
00:08:58,030 --> 00:09:01,260
We're going to try to get another deputy
to call her so that we can get her to

153
00:09:01,261 --> 00:09:02,820
come outside. Okay.

154
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,060
To have them talk for
about another minute.

155
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:10,150
You're not playing all harm yourself
or anything, are you? Nah Man.

156
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:14,300
Huh? Nah, just [inaudible]

157
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:19,600
was last night and you just want to leave.

158
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:26,220
So at this point, the deputy standing
at the edge of Rick and Amy's driveway,

159
00:09:26,221 --> 00:09:29,700
Rick is still a few miles
away over at his truck.

160
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:33,500
When suddenly in the background
of the call, you just hear

161
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:38,003
[inaudible]

162
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:43,370
fired. Who?

163
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:46,000
That was firing shots.

164
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:48,210
That's Rick trying to
figure out what happened.

165
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:53,733
Debbie.

166
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:57,143
Huh?

167
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:04,480
Heavy d p d.

168
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:12,540
Well, what, what happened
there? Okay, so, um,

169
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:16,110
what we know is while the
deputy was talking to Rick,

170
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:19,110
the other officers that
were with the deputy, uh,

171
00:10:19,111 --> 00:10:22,650
had gone ahead and gone up
to the house. Rick's wife,

172
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:26,820
Andy heard something came out
of the House with a shotgun.

173
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:29,940
The deputies say that she pointed
the shotgun at one of the deputies.

174
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,500
They opened fire and she was shot
and killed there on the front porch.

175
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,250
Did they say,

176
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:38,430
did they identify themselves or like how
did the police surprise her? OK. Okay.

177
00:10:38,431 --> 00:10:39,320
So actually, uh,

178
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:43,920
so Ben and I were able to get all of
the police dispatch recordings from that

179
00:10:43,921 --> 00:10:46,560
night. And if you go
through these recordings,

180
00:10:46,561 --> 00:10:51,561
what you hear is this crazily drawn out
version of what Ben was talking about at

181
00:10:53,011 --> 00:10:53,940
the top of the story,

182
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:58,050
the disconnect that happens between the
deputies and the dispatchers and what

183
00:10:58,051 --> 00:11:01,410
they're thinking, hearing and seeing
and what's actually happening.

184
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,050
Okay, so if you rewind to about
40 minutes before that shooting,

185
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:09,360
the first thing that happened
was Rick called his boss.

186
00:11:09,361 --> 00:11:12,690
Now we don't know exactly what was said
in that phone call because it wasn't

187
00:11:12,691 --> 00:11:13,230
recorded.

188
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:17,100
But what we do know is that Rick's boss
left that conversation believing that

189
00:11:17,101 --> 00:11:20,490
Rick might be possibly suicidal, that
there've been a fight at the house,

190
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:24,900
that Rick a had some guns with him in
his truck cause Rick and Andy had gone

191
00:11:24,901 --> 00:11:28,440
camping and that there was gun
back at the house. But anyways,

192
00:11:28,441 --> 00:11:29,970
the first thing that happened after that

193
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:30,873
call,

194
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:34,350
it's Rick's bosses, he's a fire
chief, calls fire dispatch,

195
00:11:34,351 --> 00:11:36,770
who calls a sheriff dispatcher
who ropes in another,

196
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,770
the St John's county
sheriff's office can help you,

197
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:41,870
sheriff dispatcher. And what happens is
all three dispatchers get on the line

198
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:45,130
and who is what? Who is that? The woods
trying to figure out what's going on.

199
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:46,780
His wife is no dad.

200
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:49,910
Eventually the sheriff dispatcher,
this is a special number three.

201
00:11:49,911 --> 00:11:50,744
He's just like,

202
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,250
okay, let me just call the
Stephen Jenkinson information.

203
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:56,500
I'll call the fire chief
back. Try and figure this out.

204
00:11:56,530 --> 00:11:58,890
I'll tell you this job site right now,

205
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,780
right around the time that dispatch
number three is making that call somehow

206
00:12:02,781 --> 00:12:05,930
another sheriff's dispatch or a fourth
dispatch here to Charlie Walker Shack

207
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:09,300
decides to put out a call for a welfare
check and basically ask a couple of

208
00:12:09,301 --> 00:12:11,090
devotees to go to Rick's house
and make sure everything's okay.

209
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:14,990
Okay. It's advised that he is in
the woods and it has a handgun,

210
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:17,260
which is true. Rick says he had
one in the back of the truck,

211
00:12:17,261 --> 00:12:18,280
but he says it wasn't loaded,

212
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,540
but then things start to get more
complicated because when dispatcher number

213
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:24,640
three gets a hold of Rick's
boss, the fire chief.

214
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,290
That's Greg. Can you just start with
giving me some details? He called him.

215
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:32,520
What's his issue? What's the deal? It's,
it says when Rick called him, I said,

216
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:36,360
Gee, if I'm out here on into woods,
my wife gave to me with a gun.

217
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:40,040
He just couldn't take it anymore.
And then he hung up on no,

218
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:42,570
Rick denies having said anything
like that to his boss and his boss.

219
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:46,590
As you'll hear, it does seem to walk some
of the back, but all right, thank you.

220
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:47,220
Yep.

221
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:51,030
Things are kind of already set in motion
cause then supposedly dispatch number

222
00:12:51,031 --> 00:12:53,130
four relays the chief story
to the deputies in route.

223
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:58,090
Wife has a signal zero handgun is chasing
the male who took medication on the

224
00:12:58,220 --> 00:12:59,980
right. He's hallucinating
or what's going on,

225
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:02,750
but then that same dispatcher does
special four calls. Rick's boss,

226
00:13:02,751 --> 00:13:03,380
the fire chief.

227
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:06,020
Okay. Now his wife is chasing him

228
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,820
and he's like, well Chasey Yep.

229
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:10,970
Information that he told
me to his wife had a gun,

230
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,890
which Rick says he said, but just that
there was a gun in the house. That's it.

231
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:17,860
Uh Huh. And hottie plumber
in the woods. Okay.

232
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,920
Is she starting to kill him? You
didn't say anything like that.

233
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,140
Clarification.

234
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:27,670
Male half is hiding from his wife who
signaled zero with the handgun in fear of

235
00:13:27,671 --> 00:13:31,560
her or trying to get more.
10 43 48 four. Thank you.

236
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:33,600
And this is what Ben is talking about,

237
00:13:33,601 --> 00:13:38,160
about these sort of clouds
of miscommunication because
by the time the police

238
00:13:38,161 --> 00:13:40,590
show up at this house for what
is normally a welfare check,

239
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,960
south Radio Williams, now she has a
shotgun inside the house. She has pills.

240
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:48,220
I'm like, Hey, what'd you got? She's
chased them off into the woods.

241
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:49,270
What's that address?

242
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:53,340
He's also armed, maybe even
hallucinating. So the deputies, they uh,

243
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:56,530
damn dork out here were
blocked out walking. Yeah,

244
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:58,640
I'll pull up in a blackout.

245
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:01,130
Just be careful. Um,

246
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,740
the nature of the police lights,
they get out of the cars,

247
00:14:03,741 --> 00:14:06,380
they don't even turn on their flashlights
and they start walking down this road

248
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:07,550
to Rick's place.

249
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:10,520
And one of the deputies even puts on
these night vision goggles because they

250
00:14:10,521 --> 00:14:12,680
think this woman has chased
her husband and the woods.

251
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:16,960
Supposedly he's in the
woods by his house. So just

252
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:19,323
send out too.

253
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:22,400
And is the deputy stopped walking down
this dirt road towards spritz place.

254
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:26,390
Pepper first situation gets more intense.
What just happened? What did you do?

255
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,670
Get it out. Dolls Gum.

256
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:31,440
Cause like the neighbor's dog is starting
to freak out, but eventually, okay,

257
00:14:31,441 --> 00:14:35,120
we're here. We're B six deputies
get to the edge of Rick's Treadway

258
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,280
go. I'll call you back. Okay,
thank you. Bye. Be careful.

259
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:39,850
It's actually right around here.

260
00:14:39,851 --> 00:14:43,240
About 40 minutes after Rick made
that first call to his boss,

261
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:49,280
the Rick gets a call from the deputy.
Oh, it's your fault. I bet. Higher down.

262
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:51,070
So you know the two of
them talk for a while.

263
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:53,400
Deputy's trying to figure out where
Rick is and eventually you ask.

264
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:56,640
So say your wife's daughter,
your wife's got a gun? No,

265
00:14:56,641 --> 00:15:00,930
I took all the guns with me
except for she's got 12 gauge.

266
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:03,870
Okay. Okay. Everything all
right up there at the house

267
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:05,030
and Rick slate. Yeah.

268
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:09,760
Does bringing folks at the house, we're
fine. Just okay. We're last to dispute.

269
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:10,960
No reason to be worried.

270
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:14,670
But as the deputy is talking to Rick,

271
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:16,003
um, I must be on the phone

272
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,950
for the deputies start
walking up Rick's driveway.

273
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:21,410
They want to check on Andy
so they get up to the house.

274
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:23,490
Two of them walk up onto
the porch. One of them,

275
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:27,920
he looks through the bedroom window
where Andy is and she has no reason to

276
00:15:27,921 --> 00:15:30,110
believe the police are
anywhere on her property.

277
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:33,200
She was asleep and
presumably she heard a noise,

278
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:37,760
grabbed the shotgun in the house and
came outside. Now in this moment,

279
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:40,730
all we really have to go on is
what the cops said they saw,

280
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:45,260
which is Andy came out through the front
door wearing nothing but her underwear

281
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:49,880
holding the shotgun. The cop
save. They identified themselves.

282
00:15:49,881 --> 00:15:52,100
They were screaming at
her to drop the gun.

283
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:54,290
They say that Andy took a step forward,

284
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:59,390
leveled the shotgun against her
shoulder, and then they opened fire.

285
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:04,370
If I have 24 shots, they hit Andy at
least eight times. She fell to the porch.

286
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:08,300
Uh, some of the police officers rushed
to her, began performing first aid.

287
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:12,500
Eventually they radio for an ambulance
and paramedics showed up and pronounced

288
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,670
Andy dead at the scene.

289
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:15,733
Hmm.

290
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:20,700
Did at this point, do you
have any idea what happened,

291
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,180
honey? No, not a clue.

292
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:26,380
I realized that I needed
to snap out, wake up,

293
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:30,060
get my ass in gear and find out
what's going on. But Rick's truck

294
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:31,650
was stuck and so it took a few hours,

295
00:16:31,651 --> 00:16:34,350
but eventually the cops figured out where
he was sent a crew over to meet him.

296
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:37,490
Yeah. The ground crew came over
and picked me up, handcuffed me,

297
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:40,940
and put me in the back of a pickup
truck and took me to headquarters.

298
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,880
They got them out of the car. I brought
him into headquarters, put me in a room,

299
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:48,080
typical interrogation type room. And then
I started noticing that they were, um,

300
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:54,360
being very, very friendly. Some people
saying something about, you know, my,

301
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:57,900
my camping equipment in the
truck. I remember them, um, uh,

302
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:01,130
authorizing me to have a
cigarette and the broom.

303
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,330
And then we pretty much went through
the same questioning that we've gone

304
00:17:05,331 --> 00:17:09,940
through so far. And, uh, at which
time they um, informed me that um,

305
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:14,220
they had come out to the
house to check on Andy and um,

306
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:19,310
she had come to the door and there was
an altercation and they shot and killed

307
00:17:19,311 --> 00:17:24,150
her. That was the phrasing.
It is pretty much, yeah.

308
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:29,100
And altercation. Yes. When you
hear something like that, I mean,

309
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:32,640
I can't even fathom how you
respond to some news like that.

310
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:39,420
I still can't fathom responding to it.

311
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:48,350
Did you say anything to
them? Am I under arrest?

312
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:50,610
Get these fucking cuffs off me.

313
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:56,160
How long did it take them to,
to uncuff you? I don't remember.

314
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:02,220
Were you saying anything to him while you
were still cuffed from that moment on?

315
00:18:02,221 --> 00:18:03,054
I pretty much,

316
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:09,060
well, I mean,

317
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:11,670
what do you say when somebody looks
at you and says your wife is dead?

318
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,033
We shot and killed her.

319
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:22,660
Yeah. The, the absolute
implosion of your mind. Just

320
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:33,330
the searing pain. They
explosive feeling the need.

321
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:39,320
Do I get angry? Do I get
sad? Do I break down and cry?

322
00:18:39,321 --> 00:18:40,490
Do I fall apart?

323
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:45,520
Do I hold it together long enough to
where I can figure out what the hell just

324
00:18:45,711 --> 00:18:48,560
happened. You know what

325
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:51,133
you did what?

326
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:55,910
You went out to my house in the
middle of night and you shot my wife.

327
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:05,400
I mean, how do you
respond to that? I mean,

328
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:10,290
to this day I'm still six, seven,

329
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:12,990
20, 50 times a day asking myself,

330
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:16,710
what are you talking about?

331
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:22,890
You mean she can't be dead?
What are you talking about?

332
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,160
No, no.

333
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:31,140
Did you see her at all
after the shooting? Yes.

334
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:36,750
It's about two weeks afterwards.
Where was that at? The funeral home.

335
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,590
Um, went over to the funeral home and I'm

336
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:46,020
sorry, my feet are going
to sleep. Yeah, no. Um,

337
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:51,060
and reached down and kiss her and um,

338
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:55,590
felt the edge of what I
thought was a casket move

339
00:19:57,150 --> 00:19:59,970
and it was that time that realized
that she was on a cardboard box

340
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:06,270
that just had frill on it to make it
look pretty. Did you say anything to her?

341
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:10,320
Oh yeah. Yeah.

342
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:15,990
Told her that we really need to do
something about her hair because it was a

343
00:20:15,991 --> 00:20:16,824
mess.

344
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:23,560
And the rest of what I said
to her is between me and her.

345
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:34,660
I you break. Yeah, no, of
course. Um, take a break.

346
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:41,390
I put the microphone down. Rick
got up and went over the kitchen,

347
00:20:41,391 --> 00:20:45,170
import himself a pretty
big glass of vodka. Um,

348
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:48,100
we of just walked around

349
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:49,710
the property for a while. We kept talking.

350
00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:54,730
Eventually Rick pulled out this computer
bag that he keeps buried in his closet.

351
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:57,580
Yeah. Grandma. Of all
the shooters involved,

352
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:00,580
it's this bag full of and the shots fired.

353
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:03,790
[inaudible] all the police reports
that were made about that night. Uh,

354
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:05,920
medical examiner's autopsy report. Yeah.

355
00:21:05,921 --> 00:21:10,330
You Know How many times I've sat down and
just written through all the questions

356
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:11,810
I have. Yeah.

357
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:17,500
The autopsy report that said that there
was no sir previous surgeries really,

358
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:19,610
she just had her gallbladder
taken out. Is it,

359
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:23,110
these are just questions that
constantly kept going on. You know,

360
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:26,230
coward says the, he made
eye contact with her.

361
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:29,800
That's deputy Thomas Calgary
and she with him. Okay.

362
00:21:29,801 --> 00:21:31,750
So a guy is standing at the window.

363
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:34,720
You've seen the elevation of the window
compared to wearing wherever a six foot

364
00:21:34,721 --> 00:21:35,990
tall person that's standing at it.

365
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,400
You're really telling me
that you made eye contact.

366
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,370
Rick also has all the recordings
of the police dispatch.

367
00:21:42,371 --> 00:21:46,600
How many times have you listened to
those recordings? Countless. Nonstop.

368
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:51,070
Is that like a daily thing? Hourly. He
says he just can't stop asking himself.

369
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:56,290
How did this happen? And then
eventually a, who's got the map?

370
00:21:56,470 --> 00:22:00,580
Rick walked us outside, uh, diagrams
back and said, Rick went back inside,

371
00:22:00,581 --> 00:22:03,160
came back out with this map
that his lawyers had tron up.

372
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:07,480
Take this map and position yourself in
the positions where the shooters were at.

373
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,080
He started having me and Ben, uh,

374
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:12,970
walk through the shooting of his wife,

375
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:17,200
kind of like going and placing
herself where each officer was.

376
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:18,130
This one down here,

377
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,540
he's the one that testified that he
couldn't see what he was shooting at.

378
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,500
He just knew that the other
guys were shooting. See,

379
00:22:23,501 --> 00:22:25,660
he's on the other side of the,
and the other side of that tank.

380
00:22:25,930 --> 00:22:28,030
He watches over close to the
portrait. One of the officers was,

381
00:22:28,031 --> 00:22:32,530
and you can see some of the bullet
holes in the house. Yeah, here.

382
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:37,390
There I say that's it.

383
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:40,610
So bullet went through. You're
tore up, tore up the uh,

384
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:47,590
plastic. Then we were off the front
porch over in the front yard with three.

385
00:22:47,591 --> 00:22:48,424
The deputies were,

386
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:51,850
so they see her come out and they
started moving across like this.

387
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:55,813
Yeah.

388
00:22:57,090 --> 00:23:02,090
Shooting a almost naked woman on our
front porch in the middle of the night in

389
00:23:03,061 --> 00:23:03,894
the middle of the swamp.

390
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:09,213
Fuck them.

391
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:34,860
Rick then walked inside and
left us standing in his yard.

392
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:46,940
No,

393
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:49,700
about four months after Andrew
Sheldon was shot and killed,

394
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,970
the state attorney's office sent a
letter to the Florida Department of law

395
00:23:52,971 --> 00:23:56,540
enforcement that it conducted
investigation in the
shooting saying that there'd

396
00:23:56,541 --> 00:23:59,600
be no charges brought against the
officers stating that what they did was a

397
00:23:59,601 --> 00:24:02,450
quote, justifiable use of deadly force.

398
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,950
Rick has filed a civil complaint on
behalf of the estate of Andrea Sheldon.

399
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:11,420
The complaint alleges each officer
involved in the shooting violated civil

400
00:24:11,421 --> 00:24:13,940
rights, used excessive force,

401
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:18,620
didn't follow training policy and
procedure and intentionally inflicted

402
00:24:18,621 --> 00:24:20,840
emotional distress on Rick.

403
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:24,020
When we reached out to the Saint
John's county sheriff's office,

404
00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:27,980
they said they could not comment
on the case pending litigation.

405
00:25:03,930 --> 00:25:04,250
[inaudible]
