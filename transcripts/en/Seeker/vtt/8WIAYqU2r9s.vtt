00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:04.740
- Holy crap, holy crap.

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:13.100
In Yosemite Valley, rockfalls like this one
can happen every 4-5 days,

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:17.540
where boulders that can be larger than your average car or apartment building thunder down

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:20.120
steep mountainsides.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.440
Greg stock is a geomorphologist

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:31.200
who works alongside USGS engineer Brian Collins.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:36.840
Using a combination of high-res photography, LiDAR, aerial surveillance, and 3D modeling,

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.194
it's their job to monitor rockfalls in the park,

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.740
which is critical,  especially when five million visitors pass through Yosemite each year.

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:51.740
GREG: I do think that Yosemite is tailor-made for rockfalls, because the cliffs are gigantic.

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:54.900
One example would be a rockfall in 1996

00:00:54.900 --> 00:01:00.560
where a big chunk of rock free fell most of the 3,000 feet down to the valley floor,

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:05.760
and when it hit as an in-tact block, it generated
category five hurricane strength winds

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.440
and that blew over a thousand trees
in a matter of seconds.

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.780
So what happened in those final moments to cause the rock to leave the cliff?

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:23.040
GREG: We know that there are probably decades,
or even centuries of preparing that rock to fall

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.800
but the trigger would be that last thing. 
That's the straw that breaks the camel's back.

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:33.160
Roots can grow into these cracks and the roots will expand and push the rocks off,

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.740
when water freezes in the cracks,
that can also push them off.

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.800
However, roughly a third of the rockfalls in Yosemite happen at times when Greg and Brian

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.900
aren't able to identify a trigger.

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:49.200
Historically,  rockfalls were only recorded 
if they had been witnessed by humans.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.100
So to be able to track and learn from events that may happen when no one is around,

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.920
Greg and Brian use a host of other tools.

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:03.380
BRIAN: One of those tools is ground-based laser scanning, or it's also called terrestrial LiDAR.

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:08.360
This basically gives us just millions and millions of points that we can create a three-dimensional model

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:13.280
of the cliff. So we use high-resolution photography a lot of times. You can use these photos

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:19.100
to zoom in very carefully on different aspects
of the wall, for trying to identify

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:23.200
what part of the rockfall was active recently.

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:30.320
In addition, Greg and Brian identify hazard areas 
where rockfalls have happened before.

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:36.140
Based on their computer models, they know that these are areas where another rockfall event is likely to occur.

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.640
- Look at that piece!

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.540
*thundering*

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:56.540
GREG: This is really neat, the fact that this new boulder from six months ago,

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.600
BRIAN: Mm-hmm. Right next to this one.

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.760
GREG: It's adjacent to this one, that's probably a thousand years old or more.

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.460
BRIAN: Right. You got the same pattern happening.

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:07.440
GREG: The past is the key to the present.

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.440
BRIAN: Yup.

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:12.429
Though the team can flag unstable areas,

00:03:12.429 --> 00:03:16.320
it is difficult to predict when a rockfall will happen.

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.100
Varying weather conditions, quakes, and even wildlife

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:24.880
can be the difference between a crack remaining stable for a hundred years, and a major rockfall event.

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:29.020
BRIAN: We put in specialized gear called crackmeters behind the cracks,

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:32.800
and they measured how much the crack would open over the course of a day.

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:37.260
And we tracked this over three and a half years; what we found was that during periods of heating

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.900
the crack would move in and out every day.

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:45.400
Greg and Brian's research confirmed something rock climbers and geologists have hypothesized,

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.220
but never proved: that rockfalls could be triggered
from hot weather.

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:52.520
GREG: Even though we've identified heat now as a probable trigger,

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:55.680
is the most important thing how hot it was that day?

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:02.180
Or is it the fact that maybe it was really cold the day before, and then hot that day? We don't really know that.

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:09.421
Despite the unknowns, Greg and Brian's research is highly valued by scientists that study mountains

00:04:09.421 --> 00:04:14.100
in Switzerland and Brazil. That's because the team
have a unique opportunity

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:19.780
to amass a huge volume of data based on the number of rockfalls in Yosemite.

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:25.668
There are rockfall deposits here in Yosemite that are way bigger than anything that we've seen happen

00:04:25.668 --> 00:04:31.300
in the last 150 years. Which means that there's potential for rockfalls to happen in the future

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:35.680
that are much, much bigger  than what what we have seen historically.

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:40.200
Which is why Greg and Brian's work is so important.

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:45.159
It's their data that helps to keep millions of Yosemite visitors safe each year.

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:51.220
GREG: People come here and they look at these cliffs and my sense is that they think that you know,

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:54.760
they've looked this way for thousands of years,
but that's not true at all.

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:58.640
The cliffs are changing constantly because of rockfalls.
