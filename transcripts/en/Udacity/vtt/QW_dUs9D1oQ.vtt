Hi, this is Victor again and

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:08.600
this time I'd like to show you how I
use a screen reader on everyday basis.

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:14.125
In this particular case I will be
using one of my daily things and

00:00:14.125 --> 00:00:18.435
that is looking at a public forum that
talks about accessibility issues for

00:00:18.435 --> 00:00:19.925
the Android operating system.

00:00:19.925 --> 00:00:21.795
&gt;&gt; Open locationâ€¦ About:
blank contents selected,

00:00:21.795 --> 00:00:24.575
Address and search bar, edit text
&gt;&gt; You will notice that my screen reader

00:00:24.575 --> 00:00:26.655
speaks really fast.

00:00:26.655 --> 00:00:30.315
As a beginner user you tend to
listen at much lower speeds.

00:00:30.315 --> 00:00:35.290
But as you gain efficiency with the
screen reader, you will find that making

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:40.400
it speak faster improves efficiency
when browsing content on websites.

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.180
So back to my public form.

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.505
I'm going to go to groups website.

00:00:44.505 --> 00:00:50.214
&gt;&gt; [SOUND]
[INAUDIBLE]

00:00:50.214 --> 00:00:52.534
&gt;&gt; Since I use this website every day I

00:00:52.534 --> 00:00:57.414
know that it provides a lot of shortcut
keys That allowed me to browse this

00:00:57.414 --> 00:00:58.940
website much faster.

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:01.760
So first I'll go to my groups.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.700
&gt;&gt; My groups, Google groups,
HTML content.

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:07.510
&gt;&gt; And now I will be using a screen
reader functionality there allows me to

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:09.980
browse through the links on this webpage

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.835
because I'd like to find a specific
public forum I'm looking for.

00:01:12.835 --> 00:01:16.900
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Here

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.890
you will see I have
a few message threads.

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.280
And quite recently I heard about
this new app called Swift.

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:35.670
It's a braille Keyboard that allows
people who are blind to type braille

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.400
faster on Android.

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.910
So I'm going to go back to
this thread and look at some

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:48.946
of the messages that I may have missed.

00:01:48.946 --> 00:01:52.784
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:52.784 --> 00:01:59.015
&gt;&gt; Looking at messages that

00:01:59.015 --> 00:02:05.847
I included in this thread.

00:02:05.847 --> 00:02:12.821
I used again, shortcut keys to
quickly move through messages.

00:02:12.821 --> 00:02:13.643
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE].
I did a 10:32

00:02:13.643 --> 00:02:14.400
AM (53 minutes ago) Star this post.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.210
Sergio Brunetti Hi all, sorry.

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:16.280
I am trying to create a new topic.

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.210
I sent a message in a wrong place.

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.980
I hope now it will work.

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.139
Group item.

00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:22.614
&gt;&gt; Okay, this gives me some idea as to
what people may have responded since

00:02:22.614 --> 00:02:24.412
the last time I looked at this thread.

00:02:24.412 --> 00:02:26.930
So I'm going to go back and see-
&gt;&gt; Star this topic, discussion.

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.730
&gt;&gt; If there is anything new since
the last time I looked at this forum.

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:30.600
&gt;&gt; Star this topic, discussion.

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.490
Will Talkback work on anything
that's running Adroid?

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:33.660
(5).
&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's quite a bit to read.

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.900
But anyway I hope this gives you
a quick glance into how I use this view

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:39.950
to an everyday basis.
