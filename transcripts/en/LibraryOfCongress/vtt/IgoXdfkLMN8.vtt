It is a 5X7 book featureing 

00:14:19.732 --> 00:14:22.559
color 
images.  Imagine it's as tall as

00:14:33.041 --> 00:14:41.410
The oldest written is cuneiform 
tablet dateed 2040BC.  Comic 

00:14:41.411 --> 00:14:45.232
books.  We have the world's 
largest collection of comic 

00:14:45.233 --> 00:14:48.873
books, more than 140,000 of them
them.

00:14:48.898 --> 00:14:53.404
And we also hold the world's 
most extensive newspaper 

00:14:53.405 --> 00:14:58.144
collection, the oldest original 
newspaper is from December 29th,

00:15:00.782 --> 00:15:04.183
We have the papers of 23 
presidents.  Before people 

00:15:04.184 --> 00:15:07.222
started putting them in their 
own buildings, this is the place

00:15:10.653 --> 00:15:13.876
George Washington up to Calvin 
Coolidge.

00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:20.235
We have the Gutenberg Bible, 
which is one of three perfect ve

00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:25.776
vellum copyies in the world.  
More than 15 million visual 

00:15:25.777 --> 00:15:29.108
materials including the most 
comprehensive international 

00:15:29.109 --> 00:15:33.231
collection of posters in the 
world.  And the most 

00:15:33.232 --> 00:15:39.776
comprehensive visual record of 
the civil war.  Can you imagine 

00:15:39.777 --> 00:15:43.308
how important the civil war is 
in humanityies and the arts and 

00:15:43.309 --> 00:15:50.064
the fact we have all of this 
material on this, photographs 

00:15:50.065 --> 00:15:54.121
and banned music and all sorts 
of things.

00:15:54.148 --> 00:16:01.249
The library's Packard camp for 
audio visual information and Cul

00:16:01.453 --> 00:16:05.485
Culpepepper, has 6 million items
, 

00:16:05.486 --> 00:16:11.638
including more than 3.6 million 
sound recordings and almost 

00:16:11.639 --> 00:16:13.639
2 million films.

00:16:19.969 --> 00:16:26.420
I forgot to introduce myself.  
I'm the Susan Vita, the chief of

00:16:27.234 --> 00:16:30.477
Congress.  Let me say a couple 
of things about the music 

00:16:30.478 --> 00:16:34.701
collection.  We have more than 
25 -- it's the largest music 

00:16:34.702 --> 00:16:38.828
collection in the world.  We 
have more than 25 million items,

00:16:42.253 --> 00:16:47.290
 8 million pieces of 
sheet music, which include -- 

00:16:47.291 --> 00:16:50.013
you can really learn a lot of 
things when you look at sheet 

00:16:50.014 --> 00:16:53.751
music.
Basically what ads were people 

00:16:53.752 --> 00:16:57.978
people -- you know, were 
important in that time.  What 

00:16:57.979 --> 00:17:01.117
were the clothes that people 
were wearing from the covers?

00:17:02.612 --> 00:17:10.781
We have -- they depict this 
thinking of the Titanic and the 

00:17:10.782 --> 00:17:19.229
triangle shirt waist fire, 400 
songs about baseball, more than 

00:17:19.230 --> 00:17:22.261
13,000 World War I songs.  The 
collection includes an extensive

00:17:25.479 --> 00:17:27.613
manuscripts by composeers of the

00:17:27.614 --> 00:17:29.311
American musical theater and the

00:17:29.312 --> 00:17:32.948
largest collection of any one 
kind of musical instrument in 

00:17:32.949 --> 00:17:37.588
the world and that is the flute.
So let me talk for a second 

00:17:37.589 --> 00:17:43.639
about the musical theater and 
the connections and how you can 

00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:47.371
use the library.  If you, for 
example, were going to encourage

00:17:54.014 --> 00:18:00.265
celebrating his 100th 
anniversary starting at the end 

00:18:00.266 --> 00:18:04.527
of this year, but next year in 
particularly.  So we have his 

00:18:04.528 --> 00:18:12.260
collection.  So you can see 
music in his hand here and we 

00:18:12.261 --> 00:18:14.075
have Oliver Smith's collection. 

00:18:14.076 --> 00:18:17.108
Oliver Smith was -- this is from

00:18:17.109 --> 00:18:20.426
On the Town.  We have his

00:18:31.097 --> 00:18:35.948
looks like Coney Island.
Anyway, we have things that link

00:18:36.253 --> 00:18:39.484
link, and that shows people how 
you can use original source 

00:18:39.485 --> 00:18:44.217
material and get ideas about 
other things.

00:18:44.647 --> 00:18:52.186
The archive of folk culture is 
largest repository of larger 

00:18:52.187 --> 00:18:55.403
cultural documentation and one 
of the largest in the world.  It

00:18:57.824 --> 00:19:05.388
of American Indian music and 
spoken word, and the earliest 

00:19:05.389 --> 00:19:09.621
ethnographic field recordings 
made anywhere in the world.

00:19:09.644 --> 00:19:13.449
Veterans history collects the 
storyies of veterans, and to 

00:19:13.450 --> 00:19:17.297
date 
more than 100,000 of them are 

00:19:17.298 --> 00:19:24.125
here.  The story corps project 
is a nationwide grassroots 

00:19:24.126 --> 00:19:28.265
initiative to record histories 
of people like you and me, 

00:19:28.266 --> 00:19:32.904
ordinary citizens.  How many 
stories are probably varied in 

00:19:32.905 --> 00:19:35.626
the Story Corps archives.

00:19:38.655 --> 00:19:43.276
Since 1931 the library provided 
books to the blind in Braille 

00:19:43.277 --> 00:19:47.822
and now on sound recordings.  
The talking books and digital 

00:19:47.823 --> 00:19:51.248
play back equipment.  And we 
have the world's largest 

00:19:51.249 --> 00:19:55.996
collection of cartographic 
materials, more than 5.5 million

00:19:57.798 --> 00:20:00.641
interesting parts of that is got

00:20:00.642 --> 00:20:03.656
the largest collection of fire 
insurance maps of cityies and 

00:20:03.657 --> 00:20:08.498
towns in the United States, and 
they are amazing, just to look 

00:20:08.499 --> 00:20:12.730
at them.  Very easy -- big 
enough scale so that they're 

00:20:12.731 --> 00:20:16.670
easy to read.  You can go back 
and see where your grandfather 

00:20:16.671 --> 00:20:20.108
was, you know, born and lived 
and that kind of thing.  It's 

00:20:20.109 --> 00:20:23.438
just very interesting.
So basically you can kind of 

00:20:23.439 --> 00:20:25.456
tell that I'm pretty much in awe

00:20:25.457 --> 00:20:28.983
of the embarrassment of riches 
that we have here, and the only 

00:20:28.984 --> 00:20:32.125
thing that is disappointing is 
that it's not used enough.

00:20:32.150 --> 00:20:36.565
So I'm encourageing all of you 
to 

00:20:36.566 --> 00:20:43.217
think about that as you go back 
to your own studyies and 

00:20:43.218 --> 00:20:46.447
creations and also as you en
encourage the people that you 

00:20:46.448 --> 00:20:54.534
serve to do the same.
Now it is my pleasure to 

00:20:54.535 --> 00:20:58.548
introduce Rhona from the 
Commission.  Her passion for the

00:21:00.471 --> 00:21:04.609
reason why the symposium has 
come about, and if you know Rhon

00:21:04.719 --> 00:21:07.147
Rhona, you know she's a 
difficult person to say "no" to.

00:21:15.495 --> 00:21:18.935
the best possible program to 
motivate you to go out and do 

00:21:18.936 --> 00:21:21.954
good.  So get ready for a 
wonderful experience

00:21:25.577 --> 00:21:29.515
, because Rh
Rhona planned it.

00:23:53.242 --> 00:23:55.941
To investigate the current state

00:23:55.942 --> 00:24:00.481
of the arts in our nation and 
explore how the arts connect 

00:24:00.482 --> 00:24:03.923
with other industryies.  It is 
no 

00:24:03.924 --> 00:24:10.456
wonder that under mischooseed 
leadership the NEA ranks first 

00:24:10.457 --> 00:24:13.484
among small agencies for the 
best places to work in the 

00:24:13.485 --> 00:24:19.541
federal government in 2016 with 
great honor and pleasure, I 

00:24:19.542 --> 00:24:25.170
welcome Jane.
&gt;&gt;  Thank you so much.  It's 

00:24:25.171 --> 00:24:28.110
really wonderful to be here.  
Thank you.  And I want to thank 

00:24:28.111 --> 00:24:31.032
the Library of Congress and the 
D.C. commission on the arts and 

00:24:31.033 --> 00:24:35.265
humanityies for inviting me to 
speak today.  Arts education is 

00:24:35.266 --> 00:24:38.696
a topic that is very dear to my 
heart and it's not just because 

00:24:38.697 --> 00:24:42.123
I majored in music or majored in

00:24:42.124 --> 00:24:45.044
arts education, specifically 
music education in college, but 

00:24:45.045 --> 00:24:49.682
it's because I have known about 
the power of what the arts can 

00:24:49.683 --> 00:24:54.118
do for students that not only 
honors the appreciation of art 

00:24:54.119 --> 00:24:59.055
but it spills over into so many 
areas of our daily lives.  My 

00:24:59.056 --> 00:25:01.484
father was a college professor. 

00:25:01.485 --> 00:25:05.624
Not in music, but when he died 
when I was 9, it was the piano 

00:25:05.625 --> 00:25:09.860
lessons that I was taking as a 
kid that sootheed me.  It was 

00:25:09.861 --> 00:25:14.593
music that helped me express 
myself beyond the use of just 

00:25:14.594 --> 00:25:17.917
linear everyday conversations 
and as a 9-year-old I really 

00:25:17.918 --> 00:25:22.358
didn't have the full vocabulary 
to be able to express my grief 

00:25:22.359 --> 00:25:26.683
over the loss of a parent and 
perhaps many 9-year-olds don't 

00:25:26.684 --> 00:25:30.012
have that, but I didn't have 
enough words since my parents 

00:25:30.013 --> 00:25:34.650
who were from China spoke 
Mandarin at home and I, who was 

00:25:34.651 --> 00:25:37.876
born in Oklahoma and grew up in 
Arkansas spoke English at school

00:25:37.980 --> 00:25:39.980
school, but the arts were there 
for me.

00:25:43.112 --> 00:25:46.643
So throughout my growing-up 
years, I participateed in as 

00:25:46.644 --> 00:25:48.377
many 
arts activities I could find 

00:25:48.378 --> 00:25:49.775
from music camps and singing and

00:25:49.776 --> 00:25:54.109
choirs and acting and theater 
productions to drawing every day

00:25:54.813 --> 00:25:56.932
day, and today -- to this day as

00:25:56.933 --> 00:26:00.669
an adult, I still draw every day
day.  So through my growing up 

00:26:00.670 --> 00:26:05.106
years, I became intellectually 
interested in it to the point I 

00:26:05.107 --> 00:26:07.536
majored in music in college.  So

00:26:07.537 --> 00:26:12.268
participateing in the arts gave 
me another vocabulary set.  It's

00:26:21.562 --> 00:26:26.394
to create and also live in the 
moment, where I was so immerseed

00:26:28.002 --> 00:26:33.245
time stood still.  The arts 
helped me navigate through those

00:26:36.988 --> 00:26:42.027
because I had the power to make 
each of us feel like we belong. 

00:26:43.326 --> 00:26:45.354
when we're standing in the midst

00:26:45.355 --> 00:26:47.559
of living with multiple 
perspectives and different 

00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:52.406
opinions.
The arts give us tools for self-

00:26:53.307 --> 00:26:55.015
self-expression when words alone

00:26:55.016 --> 00:26:59.855
are not enough.  They help 
channel our emotions no matter 

00:26:59.856 --> 00:27:04.404
how messy or confusing into 
something beautiful rather than 

00:27:04.405 --> 00:27:06.515
something destructive.  The arts

00:27:06.516 --> 00:27:11.954
help to empower us, to imagine 
new possibilityies for what we 

00:27:11.955 --> 00:27:14.280
might achieve.  So everybody who

00:27:14.281 --> 00:27:16.291
has participateed in the arts 
has 

00:27:16.292 --> 00:27:20.844
likely experienced these effects
effects, and all of you I'm sure

00:27:22.544 --> 00:27:27.291
body of research about arts 
education that confirms what we 

00:27:27.292 --> 00:27:30.818
instinctively know, that 
children and teenagers who 

00:27:30.819 --> 00:27:36.358
participateed in arts education 
programs were associateed with 

00:27:36.359 --> 00:27:39.173
more positive academic and 
social outcomes than students 

00:27:39.174 --> 00:27:41.315
who did not participate in those

00:27:41.316 --> 00:27:45.822
programs.  And this was 
especially true for youth who 

00:27:45.823 --> 00:27:49.260
came from households with very 
few social or economic 

00:27:49.261 --> 00:27:53.687
opportunities.  Eighth gradeers 
from low socioeconomic homes 

00:27:53.688 --> 00:27:58.629
were active in the arts in 
elementary school showed higher 

00:27:58.630 --> 00:28:00.746
test scores in science and 
writing than students who were 

00:28:00.747 --> 00:28:05.184
not active in the arts.  High 
schoolers from low socioeconomic

00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:13.841
calculus course than students 
with no arts-rich experiences.  

00:28:13.842 --> 00:28:19.092
And across the board, arts 
engage students showed higher 

00:28:19.093 --> 00:28:21.266
overall grade point averages and

00:28:21.267 --> 00:28:24.531
higher GPAs were found with 
all students who participateed  

00:28:24.532 --> 00:28:27.859
in the arts regardless of where 
students came from, regardless 

00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:31.079
if they came from low socio
socioeconomic homes or high 

00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:34.715
socioeconomic homes versus 
students who did not participate

00:28:38.254 --> 00:28:42.080
students who earned few to no 
arts credits were associateed 

00:28:42.081 --> 00:28:46.309
with being five times more 
likely not to have graduateed 

00:28:46.310 --> 00:28:50.436
than students who earned many 
arts credits.  The arts-rich 

00:28:50.437 --> 00:28:53.576
students in high school were 
more likely to go to college, 

00:28:53.577 --> 00:28:56.802
more likely to enroll in four-
four-year colleges, more likely 

00:28:56.803 --> 00:28:58.516
to get a bachelor's degree, more

00:28:58.517 --> 00:29:02.345
likely to earn mostly As in 
college, more likely to involve 

00:29:02.346 --> 00:29:06.887
themselves in the community, 
more likely to read the 

00:29:06.888 --> 00:29:10.014
newspaper at least one time in 
the day.  More likely to 

00:29:10.015 --> 00:29:13.543
participate in student 
government and service clubs, 

00:29:13.544 --> 00:29:18.282
volunteer, vote, especially 
those from low socioeconomic 

00:29:18.283 --> 00:29:19.887
background.  And by the way, you

00:29:19.888 --> 00:29:22.919
can find all of this research 
along with hundreds of other 

00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:25.842
arts education studies online at

00:29:25.843 --> 00:29:32.294
artsedsearch.org and today I'm 
drawing mostly from the work of 

00:29:32.295 --> 00:29:36.734
Dr. James Catterall.  You get 
the idea, there's a strong 

00:29:36.735 --> 00:29:39.346
relationship between children 
and teens who have high levels 

00:29:39.347 --> 00:29:43.171
of arts engagement and positive 
outcomes from their lives versus

00:29:46.095 --> 00:29:47.924
engagement, especially those who

00:29:47.925 --> 00:29:50.830
are challengeed with fewer 
social 

00:29:50.831 --> 00:29:54.060
and economic resources.
So what this means is that by 

00:29:54.061 --> 00:29:56.594
closing the gaps in terms of who

00:29:56.595 --> 00:29:58.499
has access to arts education and

00:29:58.500 --> 00:30:01.424
who does not, we're also helping

00:30:01.425 --> 00:30:03.954
to close the broader achievement

00:30:03.955 --> 00:30:07.172
gaps that exist in our 
educational system.  So if we're

00:30:10.294 --> 00:30:13.220
playing field, for you who come 
from low socioeconomic household

00:30:13.521 --> 00:30:16.549
households, then we need to get 
serious about providing equal 

00:30:16.550 --> 00:30:21.394
access to the arts, because the 
arts are not a matter of -- it's

00:30:23.018 --> 00:30:25.342
there's room in the budget.  
They are a necessity that is the

00:30:27.949 --> 00:30:32.488
across the United States reach 
their full potential in their 

00:30:32.489 --> 00:30:37.018
every moments and for their 
successful futures.  I know that

00:30:39.051 --> 00:30:40.264
humanityies understands this and

00:30:40.265 --> 00:30:44.681
I want to applaud their efforts 
to bring the arts to all D.C. 

00:30:44.682 --> 00:30:47.406
students, because the D.C. 
Commission is one of the main 

00:30:47.407 --> 00:30:52.765
supporters of the D.C. Arts and 
Humanityies Arts Collaborative, 

00:30:52.766 --> 00:30:54.484
and this is the newest member of

00:30:54.485 --> 00:31:00.739
the Kennedy's Center Any Given 
Child Program and the first to 

00:31:00.740 --> 00:31:05.166
span grades K-12 to help 
communities expand access to 

00:31:05.167 --> 00:31:08.389
arts education, and we really 
are looking forward to seeing 

00:31:08.390 --> 00:31:12.535
the results here in Washington, 
because this program is going to

00:31:13.938 --> 00:31:16.559
collective impact grant from the

00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:19.093
National Endowment For the Arts.

00:31:19.094 --> 00:31:20.699
And part of this brings together

00:31:20.700 --> 00:31:23.019
parents, students, administrator
administrators, along with the 

00:31:23.020 --> 00:31:27.764
D.C. Commission and the Kennedy 
Center to develop an arts 

00:31:27.765 --> 00:31:30.377
education agenda for Washington,
Washington, D.C. as well as 

00:31:30.378 --> 00:31:33.797
specific measureable goals for 
how the agenda will be achieved.

00:31:34.613 --> 00:31:39.866
We envision a day when all 
communities make arts education 

00:31:39.867 --> 00:31:44.277
a priority, just as D.C. is 
doing, and over the past five 

00:31:44.278 --> 00:31:49.029
decades the National Endowment 
for the Arts invested 

00:31:49.030 --> 00:31:51.436
244 million in arts education 
projects across the United 

00:31:51.437 --> 00:31:56.580
States and these projects range 
from in-school performances and 

00:31:56.581 --> 00:31:58.701
artist residencyies, after 
school 

00:31:58.702 --> 00:32:01.129
arts programs for students, 
professional development for 

00:32:01.130 --> 00:32:04.457
teachers, collective impact 
projects, such as the one I just

00:32:07.890 --> 00:32:13.016
collaborative collective impact 
group.  We must thrive and we 

00:32:13.017 --> 00:32:17.245
must strive to empower every 
child in this country with an 

00:32:17.246 --> 00:32:21.783
excellent arts education.  40% 
of our arts education grants are

00:32:26.827 --> 00:32:30.651
also launching a state-wide data

00:32:30.652 --> 00:32:33.891
infrastructure project in every 
single state that helps identify

00:32:37.010 --> 00:32:37.810
arts education opportunities for

00:32:37.811 --> 00:32:42.046
students so we can help there, 
and this is in cooperation with 

00:32:42.047 --> 00:32:43.998
the education commission of the 
states.

00:32:43.999 --> 00:32:46.579
So you get the idea.  We believe

00:32:46.580 --> 00:32:53.031
it's a big job and I do want to 
introduce Iona Hudson.  Will you

00:32:55.250 --> 00:32:58.278
arts education.  And if you have

00:32:58.279 --> 00:33:03.218
any questions... yes, she 
deserves that applause.  If you 

00:33:03.219 --> 00:33:07.136
have questions about arts 
education or grants relateed to 

00:33:07.137 --> 00:33:10.172
that email Iona and she will 
guide you through the process.  

00:33:10.173 --> 00:33:12.386
You can email her at 3:00 in the

00:33:12.387 --> 00:33:14.043
morning if you want to and she
she'll...

00:33:14.044 --> 00:33:17.952
[ Laughter ]
You're welcome.  Oh, there's 

00:33:17.953 --> 00:33:23.003
Nancy daughtery.  Nancy, stand 
as well.  We have a wonderful 

00:33:23.004 --> 00:33:26.511
team.  And so feel free to 
connect with them throughout the

00:33:28.052 --> 00:33:31.962
you.
This is a big job.  Providing 

00:33:31.963 --> 00:33:37.927
equal access to the arts require
requires input at every level, 

00:33:37.928 --> 00:33:40.640
parents, teachers, local, state,

00:33:40.641 --> 00:33:44.065
national leaders, principals, 
superintendents, and so I'm 

00:33:44.066 --> 00:33:47.699
hopeful that we're going to 
reach a day where the country 

00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:52.131
embraces the arts as a 
fundamental and indispensable 

00:33:52.132 --> 00:33:57.365
part of our children's success, 
because arts education is not 

00:33:57.366 --> 00:34:01.517
about -- just about children 
learning how to finger a B flat 

00:34:01.518 --> 00:34:06.047
on a trumpet -- that might be 
nice -- it's not just learning 

00:34:06.048 --> 00:34:10.297
how to pirouette, although that 
might be nice, or using water 

00:34:10.298 --> 00:34:13.924
colors to paint a picture of a 
tree -- that might be nice.  

00:34:13.925 --> 00:34:17.049
Arts education is about giving 
students a tool belt of skills 

00:34:17.050 --> 00:34:21.373
that allow them to reach their 
full potential where children 

00:34:21.374 --> 00:34:25.507
can achieve academiccally and 
socially and where they can 

00:34:25.508 --> 00:34:28.323
imagine a world beyond what they

00:34:28.324 --> 00:34:31.652
might know and dream of new 
possibilityies for themselves 

00:34:31.653 --> 00:34:34.266
and 
where they can express their 

00:34:34.267 --> 00:34:38.908
ideas beyond the use of linear 
everyday conversations and they 

00:34:38.909 --> 00:34:43.046
can develop self-confidence and 
discover that they really do 

00:34:43.047 --> 00:34:46.768
belong and communicate with 
others and reach those who have 

00:34:46.769 --> 00:34:50.794
perspectives different from 
their own and innovate and 

00:34:50.795 --> 00:34:54.026
create.  Because we know that 
whenever we create, we move away

00:34:56.954 --> 00:35:01.683
door to solveing those old and 
tired problems in new and 

00:35:01.684 --> 00:35:05.919
positive and meaningful ways.
The United States has always 

00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:11.267
been a nation of innovators and 
visionaryies and instilling the 

00:35:11.268 --> 00:35:15.603
arts in hour students. will help

00:35:15.604 --> 00:35:18.925
ensure that this legacy remains 
in place.  I want to thank 

00:35:18.926 --> 00:35:21.451
everybody here today for 
recognizing the importance of 

00:35:21.452 --> 00:35:25.285
arts education and working so 
hard to ensure a promising 

00:35:25.286 --> 00:35:28.306
future for all of our children. 

00:35:28.307 --> 00:35:31.137
Thank you.
[Applause]

00:35:40.792 --> 00:35:43.715
&gt;&gt;  Thank you, Jane, for an 
inspireing and lovely speech.  I

00:35:46.334 --> 00:35:50.275
off with our first panel, the 
introduction to this will be 

00:35:50.276 --> 00:35:55.622
Arthur Espinoza, executive 
director of the D.C. Commission 

00:35:55.623 --> 00:36:00.761
on the Arts and Humanities.
[Applause]

00:36:00.787 --> 00:36:02.980
&gt;&gt;  Good morning! 
&gt;&gt;  Morning! 

00:36:03.004 --> 00:36:06.524
&gt;&gt;  It's Monday and there's so 
many beautiful people in the 

00:36:06.525 --> 00:36:10.058
room.  All gathered for one 
great idea.  I'm so excited 

00:36:10.059 --> 00:36:12.781
about this.  As we said before, 
we weren't sure if this was 

00:36:12.782 --> 00:36:14.291
still up and I'm so excited that

00:36:14.292 --> 00:36:19.046
it had.  Welcome to all of you 
on behalf of the Commission of 

00:36:19.047 --> 00:36:22.582
the Arts and Humanities and I 
want to thank the Library of 

00:36:22.583 --> 00:36:25.197
Congress for their help.  We 
appreciate your coordination in 

00:36:25.198 --> 00:36:29.642
this event.  In particular, 
Susan Vita and LeeAnn Potter, as

00:36:31.062 --> 00:36:33.885
appreciateed.  If there's 
standing room I'll do 

00:36:33.886 --> 00:36:36.921
housekeeping, there's extra 
seating back over here as well, 

00:36:36.922 --> 00:36:38.635
so I want to make sure everybody

00:36:38.636 --> 00:36:40.150
is comfortable, can see and hear

00:36:40.151 --> 00:36:43.278
clearly.  We're in for a lot 
today and we hope that you'll 

00:36:43.279 --> 00:36:46.604
find good things out of it.
I also would like to thank the 

00:36:46.605 --> 00:36:49.532
Library of Congress for opening 
up what is a little information 

00:36:49.533 --> 00:36:51.355
about the treasure chest of this

00:36:51.356 --> 00:36:54.076
building.  It is just amazing to

00:36:54.077 --> 00:36:57.648
hear Ms. Vita talk about the 
things one can access here, 

00:36:57.649 --> 00:37:00.034
which I think we know about but 
we forget about sometimes or we 

00:37:00.035 --> 00:37:02.965
don't always have time.  So I 
ask that you consider your 

00:37:02.966 --> 00:37:04.690
opportunities there and how that

00:37:04.691 --> 00:37:06.902
may be able to help inform your 
work.

00:37:06.928 --> 00:37:12.653
I would like to recognize as we 
did already, Kay Candle, chair 

00:37:12.654 --> 00:37:15.765
of the commission.  Also 
Gretchen, one of our 

00:37:15.766 --> 00:37:18.797
commissioners and Hailey Francis
Francis.  And I missed a 

00:37:18.798 --> 00:37:22.235
commissioner, I hope you will 
forgive me.  But welcome.  We're

00:37:24.260 --> 00:37:27.998
to the staff, as we mentioned 
before, and Dr. Jeffrey Scott, 

00:37:27.999 --> 00:37:31.519
David Marky, arts education 
department, thank you for your 

00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:35.856
hard work today putting it 
together, and thanks to Dr. Jane

00:37:40.385 --> 00:37:42.423
And leading us with your work at

00:37:42.424 --> 00:37:46.545
the National Endowment for the 
Arts, and it's an honor to work 

00:37:46.546 --> 00:37:49.668
alongside them.  As a state 
agents we have the opportunity 

00:37:49.669 --> 00:37:52.197
to partner with the NEA to carry

00:37:52.198 --> 00:37:54.626
out their initiative as well as 
our own and we're pleased to 

00:37:54.627 --> 00:37:56.249
work with them and all the staff

00:37:56.250 --> 00:37:58.670
from the NEA.  Welcome to all of

00:37:58.671 --> 00:38:02.109
you here from the NEA.  I think 
I saw a few, but I know there's 

00:38:02.110 --> 00:38:04.125
probably others.  Great to see 
you.

00:38:04.153 --> 00:38:10.669
I also want to repeat a little 
bit about what Dr. Chu said.  I 

00:38:10.670 --> 00:38:12.482
think you heard the value of the

00:38:12.483 --> 00:38:13.704
arts education and the value how

00:38:13.705 --> 00:38:16.732
that starts to change our 
society and our community.  We 

00:38:16.733 --> 00:38:20.048
know these things that are 
really critical to what we're 

00:38:20.049 --> 00:38:21.363
doing are really critical to the

00:38:21.364 --> 00:38:23.184
communities that we live in, and

00:38:23.185 --> 00:38:27.530
they're also to business very 
valuable.  Things such as 

00:38:27.531 --> 00:38:30.342
creative thinking and critical 
skills that you have to help 

00:38:30.343 --> 00:38:33.277
inform your work, whether you 
stay in the arts or not.  Now, 

00:38:33.278 --> 00:38:35.500
we hope everyone here continues 
to have that lifelong experience

00:38:37.610 --> 00:38:41.247
it also helps bring valuable 
skills to teamwork and in a 

00:38:41.248 --> 00:38:44.875
workplace, in a business setting
setting, that's a really 

00:38:44.876 --> 00:38:47.812
valuable asset for us to have.  
And the arts help us learn that.

00:38:49.716 --> 00:38:51.958
is going to provide you with a 
lot of information about how you

00:38:54.268 --> 00:38:57.486
practice, whether you're 
interested in trying to find way

00:38:57.797 --> 00:39:00.825
ways to empower students or 
whether that's simple the work 

00:39:00.826 --> 00:39:04.363
that you're doing to find 
equitable participation in the 

00:39:04.364 --> 00:39:07.987
schools and help us break down 
those barriers that exist in the

00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:15.663
aspects that we want to address 
and the arts really do help us 

00:39:15.664 --> 00:39:18.980
do that.  Student success and 
achievement is critical and also

00:39:22.198 --> 00:39:25.025
the District of Columbia has 
been supportive of the efforts 

00:39:25.026 --> 00:39:28.666
we carry out and that you all 
carry out in arts education.  I 

00:39:28.667 --> 00:39:30.186
want to thank her for continueed

00:39:30.187 --> 00:39:33.014
support of the Commission and 
for her continueed support 

00:39:33.015 --> 00:39:36.139
especially of arts education.  
We apressure crate all she's 

00:39:36.140 --> 00:39:39.358
doing to support us.
I hope there will be great in

00:39:39.464 --> 00:39:42.300
insights and we're going to get 
going now with the first panel. 

00:39:43.499 --> 00:39:47.029
talking, so now we're ready to 
start listening to others to 

00:39:47.030 --> 00:39:49.570
invite us to think more deeply. 

00:39:49.571 --> 00:39:52.982
Helping us do that is our 
special guest and moderator for 

00:39:52.983 --> 00:39:55.806
the first panel, senior vice 
president for education at the 

00:39:55.807 --> 00:40:03.374
John F. Kennedy Center for the 
Performing Arts Mario Rossero.  

00:40:03.375 --> 00:40:06.478
I don't say that much.  You 
probably say it all the time.

00:40:06.809 --> 00:40:09.183
[Applause]

00:40:16.471 --> 00:40:17.780
&gt;&gt;  Good morning.  It's great to

00:40:17.781 --> 00:40:21.333
join you.  I feel like it's an 
arts education family reunion 

00:40:21.334 --> 00:40:22.932
moments.  I have one of the best

00:40:22.933 --> 00:40:26.061
jobs in the world.  I get to 
lead the education efforts at 

00:40:26.062 --> 00:40:29.300
the Kennedy Center for the 
Performing Arts, local, regional

00:40:32.019 --> 00:40:34.656
my colleagues who have done a 
great job to set the table I 

00:40:34.657 --> 00:40:38.891
think for today's conversation, 
but first I want to thank Rhona 

00:40:38.892 --> 00:40:43.214
and the Commission for the 
invitation to join today.  You 

00:40:43.215 --> 00:40:47.949
may not know that this past May 
was 100th birthday of President 

00:40:47.950 --> 00:40:51.890
Kennedy.  For the Kennedy Center
Center, many know us for the 

00:40:51.891 --> 00:40:56.125
world class performing arts on 
our stages but we also uplift 

00:40:56.126 --> 00:40:59.045
the ideals from President 
Kennedy's legacy of service, 

00:40:59.046 --> 00:41:02.576
justice, freedom, courage and 
gratitude through the arts, 

00:41:02.577 --> 00:41:06.310
through the memorials that the 
building really is to him.  But 

00:41:06.311 --> 00:41:10.855
the Kennedy Center is more than 
just a building or address.  It

00:41:10.998 --> 00:41:14.891
It's also this ideal, and it's 
an ideal that the arts are 

00:41:14.892 --> 00:41:18.017
really for everyone, so as a 
nation's cultural center we feel

00:41:19.032 --> 00:41:22.359
shoulders to make sure that 
we're fighting alongside all of 

00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:25.074
our colleagues in this room to 
make sure the barriers to access

00:41:32.531 --> 00:41:35.879
experiences are available to all
all.  It's my team's charge to 

00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:38.488
make sure we lock arms with 
colleagues here and across the 

00:41:38.489 --> 00:41:42.525
country and we take a lot of 
time to identify and know what 

00:41:42.526 --> 00:41:46.364
the problems and challenges in 
the field of arts education and 

00:41:46.365 --> 00:41:49.590
arts learning are as well as 
some of the best practices, and 

00:41:49.591 --> 00:41:52.812
we're really lucky to have the 
support and resources to create 

00:41:52.813 --> 00:41:54.560
some model programs that can try

00:41:54.561 --> 00:41:56.948
out some solutions to those 
problems, right?  Because 

00:41:56.949 --> 00:41:58.159
everybody in this room, we stand

00:41:58.160 --> 00:42:02.087
on the shoulders of a history of

00:42:02.088 --> 00:42:03.902
work and effort to really tackle

00:42:03.903 --> 00:42:06.635
this problem, right?  And I 
would like to acknowledge 

00:42:06.636 --> 00:42:11.390
everyone who spent the last 20, 
30, 40, 50 years really working 

00:42:11.391 --> 00:42:14.010
at this and I think it takes 
everyone working together in 

00:42:14.011 --> 00:42:17.642
lockstep to add are dress the 
arts education challenges and 

00:42:17.643 --> 00:42:20.935
it's a cross-sectoral challenge,

00:42:20.936 --> 00:42:22.481
but I am inspired and excited we

00:42:22.482 --> 00:42:25.201
can do it together and I think 
the voices that we're going to 

00:42:25.202 --> 00:42:28.125
hear from today give us a range 
of perspectives and what we're 

00:42:28.126 --> 00:42:33.870
going to hear about is not just 
about equity, access and 

00:42:33.871 --> 00:42:36.702
innovation in arts and arts 
education but it's rooted in 

00:42:36.703 --> 00:42:42.452
some exemplar, best practices, 
really looking at the evidence 

00:42:42.453 --> 00:42:45.876
and demonstration of the power 
of the arts.

00:42:45.906 --> 00:42:49.628
So if you would join me in a 
round of applause, I'm going to 

00:42:49.629 --> 00:42:53.767
welcome our panelists up to the 
stage.  So I'm going to talk a 

00:42:53.768 --> 00:42:57.385
little bit and buy time as they 
make their way up, but maybe 

00:42:57.386 --> 00:43:01.828
we'll have continuous round of 
applause.  We have Dr. Alexander

00:43:06.066 --> 00:43:09.093
Hopkins.
We have Christopher K. Morgan 

00:43:09.094 --> 00:43:12.923
from Dance Place, local arts 
organization.

00:43:12.967 --> 00:43:16.744
My good friend Nathan Diamond 
from D.C. public schools who 

00:43:16.745 --> 00:43:23.403
leads the arts charge for the 
district, and we have Asha 

00:43:23.404 --> 00:43:27.442
Gardner from Split This Rock.
[Applause]

00:43:27.484 --> 00:43:32.673
Before we jump into our 
conversation, we always believe 

00:43:32.674 --> 00:43:35.150
that it is a good

00:43:38.313 --> 00:43:40.437
 idea to start 
with the arts.  Alex was willing

00:43:46.226 --> 00:43:50.829
Take it away.

00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:03.280
 Gallatin

00:46:35.180 --> 00:46:39.625
&gt;&gt;  Before we get started, my 
goal is to really have a great 

00:46:39.626 --> 00:46:42.138
conversation with everyone but 
leave time at the end for 

00:46:42.139 --> 00:46:44.464
audience questions, so as you 
listen, think about anything 

00:46:44.465 --> 00:46:47.308
that might be on your mind that 
you want to go deeper in, so 

00:46:47.309 --> 00:46:50.826
please consider that.  Also 
everyone's bios are in your 

00:46:50.827 --> 00:46:53.966
program book, so you might go 
deeper to find out about folks 

00:46:53.967 --> 00:46:57.295
there, and I was asked to make 
sure everyone has their cell 

00:46:57.296 --> 00:46:58.502
phones on silent before we start

00:46:58.503 --> 00:46:59.516
our conversation.  Thank you for

00:46:59.517 --> 00:47:02.750
that.
So let's start with you.  Thank 

00:47:02.751 --> 00:47:07.996
you for that bevel piece and 
shareing your artistic talents 

00:47:07.997 --> 00:47:10.921
as 
well, but we love the idea about

00:47:12.827 --> 00:47:17.871
overlapping, we actually find a 
lot of connections between all 

00:47:17.872 --> 00:47:21.414
the art forms and health and 
wellness, but we know you eave 

00:47:21.415 --> 00:47:25.140
got a particular interest and 
focus in music and wellness and 

00:47:25.141 --> 00:47:27.244
health, so I wonder if you might

00:47:27.245 --> 00:47:30.188
give us a context about your 
work and some of the findings 

00:47:30.189 --> 00:47:32.710
and things you're finding 
interesting right now in your 

00:47:32.711 --> 00:47:34.711
work.

00:47:36.620 --> 00:47:39.363
&gt;&gt;  Thank you very much.  It's 
my pleasure to be here this 

00:47:39.364 --> 00:47:42.279
morning in front of this full 
room.  I do have a sense that 

00:47:42.280 --> 00:47:47.426
I'm preaching to the choir, but 
it's nevertheless very important

00:47:47.427 --> 00:47:49.427
important.

00:47:52.246 --> 00:47:55.872
As you can tell music is near 
and dear to me.  For my patient

00:47:55.981 --> 00:47:59.110
patient's sake, I hope I'm a 
better physician than I am a 

00:47:59.111 --> 00:48:02.754
musician, but I've been playing 
the violin since I was seven, so

00:48:04.465 --> 00:48:08.394
including a public school and 
elementary school, I still 

00:48:08.395 --> 00:48:15.255
remember my orchestra days 
playing William Tell Overture.  

00:48:15.256 --> 00:48:18.778
It played a central role in my 
life, but what I want to say a 

00:48:18.779 --> 00:48:23.420
few words about now is that 
research over the last five to 

00:48:23.421 --> 00:48:27.139
seven years has actually 
provided evidence for the 

00:48:27.140 --> 00:48:33.093
importance of music education 
and it's linked to success 

00:48:33.094 --> 00:48:36.404
throughout the lifetime of a 
person, and particularly 

00:48:36.405 --> 00:48:42.545
academic achievement.
So there was a hypothesis put 

00:48:42.546 --> 00:48:46.592
forth by Dr. Patel from Tufts 
University and published in 

00:48:46.593 --> 00:48:50.029
Frontiers of Psychology in 2011 
and it's easy to remember, 

00:48:50.030 --> 00:48:55.762
because the acronym of the 
hypothesis is OPERA., and that I

00:48:59.097 --> 00:49:02.012
has been done in the last five 
to six years.

00:49:02.040 --> 00:49:06.450
The OPERA hypothesis proposes 
that benefits -- possible 

00:49:06.451 --> 00:49:11.500
benefits of music are driven by 
elasticity test in the speech 

00:49:11.501 --> 00:49:16.440
processing parts of the brain.  
The brain networks networks for 

00:49:16.441 --> 00:49:19.946
speech, 
and this occurs when five 

00:49:19.947 --> 00:49:23.390
conditions are met.  So that's 
the acronym.  And they are O for

00:49:26.318 --> 00:49:32.454
emotion, R for repetition and A 
for attention.  There is an 

00:49:32.455 --> 00:49:35.800
anatomical overlap in the brain 
networks that process sound 

00:49:35.801 --> 00:49:39.713
features used in both music and 
speech.  For example, the 

00:49:39.714 --> 00:49:44.954
amplitude of the sound waves as 
well as the periodicity which 

00:49:44.955 --> 00:49:48.885
the sound waves appear.  P 
stands for precision.  Music 

00:49:48.886 --> 00:49:54.026
places higher demands on the 
shared networks when compared to

00:50:01.594 --> 00:50:05.322
musical activityies that engage 
this network can elist very 

00:50:05.323 --> 00:50:09.058
strong emotions.  I don't know 
how many of you have had the 

00:50:09.059 --> 00:50:12.386
experience of feeling chills or 
shivers up and down your spine 

00:50:12.387 --> 00:50:15.625
when you're listening to a 
pleasurable piece of music.  Of 

00:50:15.626 --> 00:50:18.657
course, one size does not fit 
all.  It's very individual.  But

00:50:21.374 --> 00:50:22.985
scientificcally demonstrateed in

00:50:22.986 --> 00:50:27.212
the last six years or so that 
powerful emotional centers are 

00:50:27.213 --> 00:50:30.345
activateed when listening to 
music.  R stands for repetition.

00:50:32.971 --> 00:50:35.766
engage this network connected to

00:50:35.767 --> 00:50:39.437
speech are frequently repeated 
as we're listening and as we're 

00:50:39.438 --> 00:50:43.174
practicing an instrument or 
singing, and that repetition is 

00:50:43.175 --> 00:50:45.075
crucial to success.  And finally

00:50:45.076 --> 00:50:49.106
A for attention.  Musical 
activityies that engage in that 

00:50:49.107 --> 00:50:51.235
work I'm talking about are 
associateed with focused 

00:50:51.236 --> 00:50:55.174
attention, and, of course, you 
have to pay attention as we're 

00:50:55.175 --> 00:50:58.590
learning musical instrument.
So according to the OPERA 

00:50:58.591 --> 00:51:02.695
hypothesis, when these condition
conditions are met, neural 

00:51:02.696 --> 00:51:03.849
plasticity, long-term changes in

00:51:03.850 --> 00:51:07.879
the brain drives these networks 
to function with higher 

00:51:07.880 --> 00:51:11.597
precision that is needed for 
ordinary speech communication, 

00:51:11.598 --> 00:51:16.440
however, since speech shares 
these networks with music, 

00:51:16.441 --> 00:51:19.868
speech benefits in a secondary 
way.  The processing of speech 

00:51:19.869 --> 00:51:23.698
itself.  And so the OPERA 
hypothesis has been used to 

00:51:23.699 --> 00:51:26.215
account for superior encodeing 
of 

00:51:26.216 --> 00:51:29.337
speech in musically trained 
individual, which I won't have 

00:51:29.338 --> 00:51:31.457
time to go into in detail today,

00:51:31.458 --> 00:51:34.485
but I'm happy to answer 
questions about.  And this 

00:51:34.486 --> 00:51:37.519
suggests mechanisms by which 
musical training could improve 

00:51:37.520 --> 00:51:39.026
the linguistic reading ability. 

00:51:39.027 --> 00:51:42.547
So I'm just going to run through

00:51:42.548 --> 00:51:46.379
literally the headlines of study
studies published in the last 

00:51:46.380 --> 00:51:50.217
five or six years and there's 
one particularly relevant study 

00:51:50.218 --> 00:51:54.951
by Kraus from Northwest 
University in Chicago that I 

00:51:54.952 --> 00:51:59.100
want to focus on a couple 
minutes.  So thus far studies 

00:51:59.101 --> 00:52:02.219
have shown that babies, one
one-year-olds who have music 

00:52:02.220 --> 00:52:05.846
lessons with their parents tend 
to smile more and earlier and 

00:52:05.847 --> 00:52:11.903
communicate better.  Music 
training can improve white 

00:52:11.904 --> 00:52:15.529
matter connectivity, the highway
highways in our brain that 

00:52:15.530 --> 00:52:18.042
connect the thinking gray matter

00:52:18.043 --> 00:52:21.688
areas enable rapid millisecond 
level processing, they are 

00:52:21.689 --> 00:52:24.808
actually strengthened as a 
result of musical training.  Not

00:52:26.937 --> 00:52:30.358
active musical training 
participation.  So I could go 

00:52:30.359 --> 00:52:32.578
into details if you're interest
interested as far as how long it

00:52:38.109 --> 00:52:41.952
one year sometimes, one year to 
15 months of musical training, 

00:52:41.953 --> 00:52:45.929
changes are seen in the brain.  
Where the changes seen?  The 

00:52:45.930 --> 00:52:49.122
corpus collosum, main white 
matter highway connecting the 

00:52:49.123 --> 00:52:53.344
two hemispheres, the two halves 
of the brain, that's actually 

00:52:53.345 --> 00:52:55.271
made thicker, strengthened 
strengthened as a 

00:52:55.272 --> 00:53:03.220
result of musical training over 
time.  And the articula, the 

00:53:03.221 --> 00:53:05.344
left side of the brain serves as

00:53:05.345 --> 00:53:08.173
the main connection between the 
areas understanding language and

00:53:10.079 --> 00:53:12.079
as well.

00:53:13.499 --> 00:53:15.531
  Blood flow in the 
brain in some of the speech 

00:53:15.532 --> 00:53:19.447
areas I mentioned  in the OPERA 
hypothesis is increased real 

00:53:19.448 --> 00:53:22.480
realtime 
pack clickcally as a result of 

00:53:22.481 --> 00:53:24.996
music training and exposure. 
exposure. executive function, 

00:53:24.997 --> 00:53:29.639
point A to point B to point C, 
multitaskingtasking, so crucial 

00:53:29.640 --> 00:53:31.457
in 
their world, that improves as a 

00:53:31.458 --> 00:53:35.389
result of musical training over 
time.  The gray matter, not just

00:53:37.106 --> 00:53:38.620
in the cortex, the outer part of

00:53:38.621 --> 00:53:42.266
the brain, are actually made 
bigger as a result of musical 

00:53:42.267 --> 00:53:45.985
training and exposure.
Verbal memory and childhood 

00:53:45.986 --> 00:53:50.626
literacy is actually improved 
over time as a result of classes

00:53:51.030 --> 00:53:55.965
classes, exposing people to 
music.  And this is not just for

00:53:58.782 --> 00:54:01.018
lifetime, as we age, there's now

00:54:01.019 --> 00:54:05.547
several studies that show that 
the brain plasticity is benefit

00:54:05.750 --> 00:54:08.768
benefited by musical training 
throughout the lifetime.  And, 

00:54:08.769 --> 00:54:13.000
in fact, this is now beginning 
to be thought as a protective 

00:54:13.001 --> 00:54:16.026
measure, playing a musical 
instrument against cognitive 

00:54:16.027 --> 00:54:20.174
aging, mild cognitive impairment
impairment, dementia of the 

00:54:20.175 --> 00:54:21.374
Alzheimer's type and otherwise. 

00:54:21.375 --> 00:54:25.609
What I want to emphasize a 
little bit more, that's Dr. Nina

00:54:28.043 --> 00:54:31.168
is that it actually may -- 
musical training in school may 

00:54:31.169 --> 00:54:36.410
actually help reduce academic 
achievement gaps, and August 

00:54:36.411 --> 00:54:38.112
August 2014 report from the 
American Psychological 

00:54:38.113 --> 00:54:39.433
Association stated that learning

00:54:39.434 --> 00:54:45.372
to play a musical instrument or 
to sing disadvantaged children 

00:54:45.373 --> 00:54:48.496
strengthened reading and 
language skills which may reduce

00:54:50.219 --> 00:54:51.620
These findings involved hundreds

00:54:51.621 --> 00:54:54.654
of children participating in 
musical training programs in 

00:54:54.655 --> 00:54:57.472
both Chicago and Los Angeles 
public schools.  The positive 

00:54:57.473 --> 00:55:00.605
role that musical training can 
have for youth living in 

00:55:00.606 --> 00:55:02.514
impoverished areas was presented

00:55:02.515 --> 00:55:07.060
by Dr. Kraus in 2014 at the 
American Psychological 

00:55:07.061 --> 00:55:10.979
Association annual convention.  
The research concluded that 

00:55:10.980 --> 00:55:12.699
musical training can enhance the

00:55:12.700 --> 00:55:18.033
way children's nervous systems 
process sounds in busy or 

00:55:18.034 --> 00:55:21.563
chaotic environments like a 
classroom or playground.  After 

00:55:21.564 --> 00:55:24.998
just two years of musical 
training, not one -- she looked 

00:55:24.999 --> 00:55:28.933
at one and also two years -- 
after two years of musical 

00:55:28.934 --> 00:55:33.764
training, the children's brain 
responses to sounds were faster 

00:55:33.765 --> 00:55:37.499
and more precise than in 
students who had other types of 

00:55:37.500 --> 00:55:43.029
enrichment classes, so this was 
not just comparison of music 

00:55:43.030 --> 00:55:45.563
classes to nothing.
The improved neural function 

00:55:45.564 --> 00:55:49.484
caused by music training may 
lead to enhanced memory and 

00:55:49.485 --> 00:55:50.996
attention span which in turn can

00:55:50.997 --> 00:55:52.610
make it easyier for kids to stay

00:55:52.611 --> 00:55:55.151
focused  in the classroom and 
improve their communication 

00:55:55.152 --> 00:55:59.669
skills.  Other separate studies 
over the last five to six years 

00:55:59.670 --> 00:56:04.016
have shown that arithmetic 
performance, achievement in 

00:56:04.017 --> 00:56:07.837
verbal skills, language learning
learning, and even second, 

00:56:07.838 --> 00:56:10.455
foreign language acquisition, 
which I argue is increasingly 

00:56:10.456 --> 00:56:14.704
important in our globalizeed 
world, that actually can be made

00:56:18.029 --> 00:56:20.547
before that music a language all

00:56:20.548 --> 00:56:24.464
its own.  There's actually 
neural anatomical, neural 

00:56:24.465 --> 00:56:25.681
biological truth to that, and we

00:56:25.682 --> 00:56:29.728
know that with each additional 
language acquired, it becomes 

00:56:29.729 --> 00:56:31.538
easyier to acquire the 
subsequent 

00:56:31.539 --> 00:56:35.169
language.  Even if it's not 
connected in any way to the 

00:56:35.170 --> 00:56:39.494
languages you already know.
So research has shown that there

00:56:41.308 --> 00:56:44.231
of children raised in impoverish
impoverished environments that 

00:56:44.232 --> 00:56:46.972
affect their ability to learn, 
while more affluent students do 

00:56:46.973 --> 00:56:50.687
better in school than kids from 
lower income backgrounds we 

00:56:50.688 --> 00:56:53.328
start to find that musical 
training can alter the nervous 

00:56:53.329 --> 00:56:57.047
system to create a better 
learner and help offset this 

00:56:57.048 --> 00:57:00.885
academic gap. 
And so I'm happy to talk more, 

00:57:00.886 --> 00:57:03.939
but I want to make sure that 
other panelists have enough time

00:57:03.990 --> 00:57:09.952
time.  So I just want to 
conclude by saying that evidence

00:57:11.469 --> 00:57:14.297
training boosts brain power and 
cognitive function in children 

00:57:14.298 --> 00:57:17.420
and adults, neural enhancements 
that are gained through the 

00:57:17.421 --> 00:57:20.345
musical training early in life 
can extend throughout the 

00:57:20.346 --> 00:57:24.874
lifespan and into old age and 
hopefully these findings can 

00:57:24.875 --> 00:57:26.999
inspire parents and policymakers

00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:28.605
to advocate for musical training

00:57:28.606 --> 00:57:31.737
in school as enjoyable and 
fulfilling outlet that also has 

00:57:31.738 --> 00:57:35.667
the power to boost our brain 
strength and improve reading, 

00:57:35.668 --> 00:57:38.901
writing and arithmetic.  There 
are data that actually need to 

00:57:38.902 --> 00:57:44.951
be expanded upon that all 
aspects of the SAT are improved 

00:57:44.952 --> 00:57:48.691
20 to 30 points when compareing 
kids who have had music classes 

00:57:48.692 --> 00:57:51.719
regularly throughout school to 
those who have not.  So it seems

00:57:53.842 --> 00:57:57.266
brain -- helps keep our brain 
sharp as we age and could be an 

00:57:57.267 --> 00:58:02.205
integral part of rehabilitative 
programs for older adults as 

00:58:02.206 --> 00:58:04.935
well with cognitive decline.
&gt;&gt;  Thank you, Alex.

00:58:04.961 --> 00:58:10.983
[Applause]
&gt;&gt;  I think that's a great 

00:58:10.984 --> 00:58:13.407
starting with the evidence is a 
great place to start.  And I 

00:58:13.408 --> 00:58:16.439
know everybody in this room is 
interested and also chargeed 

00:58:16.440 --> 00:58:17.748
with 
measureing the impact and 

00:58:17.749 --> 00:58:19.560
telling 
the stories of our work, right?

00:58:19.561 --> 00:58:22.995
So often we're looking at the 
intervention and the classroom 

00:58:22.996 --> 00:58:26.531
or with kids and we're tracking 
that, but I love holding those 

00:58:26.532 --> 00:58:30.450
outcomes against the science as 
well because seems like that 

00:58:30.451 --> 00:58:32.265
would make a powerful argument. 

00:58:32.266 --> 00:58:34.994
When prepping for this 
conversation, Alex and I had a 

00:58:34.995 --> 00:58:38.440
brief chat about the Kennedy 
Center's work with Renee Fleming

00:58:38.443 --> 00:58:41.151
Fleming.  She has ha deep 
interest in music and wellness, 

00:58:41.152 --> 00:58:44.182
right?  So we've done a sound 
health initiative and a project 

00:58:44.183 --> 00:58:50.027
called Music in the Mind, but 
she literally had this opera div

00:58:50.629 --> 00:58:55.285
diva, MIR singing in aria and 
checking brain waves as it's 

00:58:55.286 --> 00:58:59.472
going, and we saw the 
visualization and the most sort 

00:58:59.473 --> 00:59:05.563
of stark outcome to me was not 
when she was singing, it was 

00:59:05.564 --> 00:59:09.578
preparation to be creativity.  
That's when the brain lit up 

00:59:09.579 --> 00:59:12.423
with most activity, preparation 
to create.  Which was interest

00:59:12.430 --> 00:59:14.933
interesting.  It resonates when 
you think about it, because 

00:59:14.934 --> 00:59:16.354
you're getting ready, your brain

00:59:16.355 --> 00:59:19.491
is getting ready, you're prepare
preparing for that moment Hoff 

00:59:19.492 --> 00:59:21.806
creation or that act of making. 

00:59:21.807 --> 00:59:25.338
Really exciting.  Thank you for 
starting us off.  Also on this 

00:59:25.339 --> 00:59:28.970
panel we have experts from 
different ar forums, so we know 

00:59:28.971 --> 00:59:32.405
that every art form makes an 
impact on students and we find 

00:59:32.406 --> 00:59:33.808
at least one but maybe sometimes

00:59:33.809 --> 00:59:36.636
multiple ways to express 
ourselves and to communicate.

00:59:37.439 --> 00:59:40.672
So Christopher, I would like to 
turn to you next.  I would love 

00:59:40.673 --> 00:59:42.596
to hear a little bit about Dance

00:59:42.597 --> 00:59:45.019
Place and the role in the 
community and just sort of talk 

00:59:45.020 --> 00:59:47.435
about your work and how it fits 
into this conversation.

00:59:47.460 --> 00:59:50.671
&gt;&gt;  Absolutely.  Hello, everyone
everyone, my name is Christopher

00:59:50.965 --> 00:59:55.502
Christopher.  My sign name was 
given to me by polish deaf 

00:59:55.503 --> 00:59:59.432
students 20 years ago.  This is 
my sign name.  My pronouns are 

00:59:59.433 --> 01:00:04.478
he/his.  As a native Hawaiian it
it's important for me to connect

01:00:09.925 --> 01:00:14.265
recognize we're on stolen land 
from native tribes and to bring 

01:00:14.266 --> 01:00:16.188
my ancestors into the room, it's

01:00:16.189 --> 01:00:18.201
nonsecular, about the meeting of

01:00:18.202 --> 01:00:22.532
two, land and seas, sky and 
water.

01:00:22.558 --> 01:00:25.082
[ chanting ]

01:00:37.029 --> 01:00:43.198
AlolAAloha, probably the only 
Hawaiian word you know.

01:00:43.224 --> 01:00:45.718
That's the foundation of equity,

01:00:45.719 --> 01:00:50.063
recognizing as many things as I 
can sense in one moment, and 

01:00:50.064 --> 01:00:53.386
that's the foundation of bridge
bridging to youth and just 

01:00:53.387 --> 01:00:57.827
people in general.
And so for me, you know, the 

01:00:57.828 --> 01:00:59.328
dance person always has to get a

01:00:59.329 --> 01:01:03.374
little interactive.  I would 
love to ask for you just sitting

01:01:10.954 --> 01:01:16.801
towards the future for me?
Nice.  I love arts people.  It's

01:01:21.635 --> 01:01:25.480
want a better survey.  Try to 
keep the same answer.  Point 

01:01:25.481 --> 01:01:28.806
towards the future. 
Someone made a dance out of it. 

01:01:31.033 --> 01:01:34.966
So great.  Just anecdoteally, 
what I tended to see was forward

01:01:40.921 --> 01:01:43.748
peripheral vision, right?  If 
I'm dancing with people in a 

01:01:43.749 --> 01:01:48.181
line, like the rockettes -- I've
 I've 

01:01:48.182 --> 01:01:51.203
never been a Rockette, but I 
dreamed of it, if I'm dancing 

01:01:51.204 --> 01:01:53.121
with people in a line, I have to

01:01:53.122 --> 01:01:57.170
use peripheral vision to sense, 
if needed, in unison.  We use 

01:01:57.171 --> 01:02:01.207
that all the time as lay people 
in driving and other daily 

01:02:01.208 --> 01:02:04.828
skills.  But one of the things 
that I think is interesting in 

01:02:04.829 --> 01:02:08.464
some cultures, the future is 
neither forward or up.  It's 

01:02:08.465 --> 01:02:11.500
back here.  Because you can't 
see it yet.  It has not been 

01:02:11.501 --> 01:02:16.641
revealed to you yet.  However, 
there is so much that we have as

01:02:18.652 --> 01:02:26.127
intuition, our envelope tint, 
our gut.  In Hawaiian it's nuh-o

01:02:26.329 --> 01:02:29.951
nuh-ow that allow us to sense 
the unseen.  For me a lot about 

01:02:29.952 --> 01:02:35.689
equity and access is trying to 
tune into that.  How do we sense

01:02:35.902 --> 01:02:37.607
sense -- sense is related to the

01:02:37.608 --> 01:02:41.542
word "sensitive"."  How are we 
sensitive to the needs of others

01:02:42.151 --> 01:02:46.897
others?  Words we use a lot as 
arts educators and advocates.  

01:02:46.898 --> 01:02:48.317
How do we do that and connect to

01:02:48.318 --> 01:02:49.624
that?  So much of that is tune
ing 

01:02:49.625 --> 01:02:53.249
in and listening, and all art 
forms are really good at that, 

01:02:53.250 --> 01:02:56.183
and that's why so much of that 
evidence about how it spans out 

01:02:56.184 --> 01:02:58.902
into other aspects of our lives,

01:02:58.903 --> 01:03:02.338
the scientific, the educational 
data, all of those things pay 

01:03:02.339 --> 01:03:06.378
off because it's allowing us to 
tune into others.  So a little 

01:03:06.379 --> 01:03:09.910
bit about Dance Place.  I'm the 
executive artistic director of 

01:03:10.106 --> 01:03:13.237
Dance Place based in Washington,
Washington, D.C.  It's a 37

01:03:13.238 --> 01:03:16.463
37-year-old institution.  And we
we've been in our location in 

01:03:16.464 --> 01:03:21.018
Brooklyn Edward for 31 years.  
Our founding director, Carla Pur

01:03:21.104 --> 01:03:25.453
Purlow and co-director Debra 
Riley retired and I became the 

01:03:25.454 --> 01:03:26.861
director after a national search

01:03:26.862 --> 01:03:31.400
for a new director last 
September.  I'm pretty new to 

01:03:31.401 --> 01:03:33.011
this role.  Obviously not new to

01:03:33.012 --> 01:03:36.544
the arts.  Dance Place, in 
addition to presenting theater 

01:03:36.545 --> 01:03:40.373
that hosts over 45 weekends of 
performances each year from 

01:03:40.374 --> 01:03:42.282
international, national and area

01:03:42.283 --> 01:03:48.654
companies and having a school 
and having youth enrichment 

01:03:48.655 --> 01:03:51.558
programs, has been an anchor in 
the neighborhood.  When Carla 

01:03:51.559 --> 01:03:52.766
and the board at the time bought

01:03:52.767 --> 01:03:57.717
the building 31 years ago, it 
became kind of a galvanizeing 

01:03:57.718 --> 01:04:00.546
force for that neighborhood and 
we all recognized the problems 

01:04:00.547 --> 01:04:04.075
that come with genetic tri
trification.  We've been pretty 

01:04:04.076 --> 01:04:07.795
fortunate in the Brooklyn edge
edgewood neighborhood because 

01:04:07.796 --> 01:04:11.031
history of high home ownership 
in that neighborhood and pockets

01:04:12.638 --> 01:04:16.063
of development that happened in 
the last five to ten years in 

01:04:16.064 --> 01:04:19.995
particular didn't displace too 
many people.  I fear, and think 

01:04:19.996 --> 01:04:22.420
it might be coming in the future

01:04:22.421 --> 01:04:24.140
as development increases, but to

01:04:24.141 --> 01:04:27.277
date it hasn't been too jarring.

01:04:27.278 --> 01:04:29.483
What's happened in our 
neighborhood is our community 

01:04:29.484 --> 01:04:34.329
has continueed to mix both 
economically, racially, and all 

01:04:34.330 --> 01:04:36.850
kind of definitions of diversity
diversity.

01:04:36.884 --> 01:04:40.894
So that's presented Dance Place 
with wonderful opportunities in 

01:04:40.895 --> 01:04:42.293
our different programs to engage

01:04:42.294 --> 01:04:45.719
the community to bring them in 
and see what happens as a third 

01:04:45.720 --> 01:04:48.540
space, what can we do when we 
bring these different 

01:04:48.541 --> 01:04:51.669
communities together?
When Carla and the original 

01:04:51.670 --> 01:04:56.418
Dance Place staff and faculty 
were there 31 years ago, a 

01:04:56.419 --> 01:05:00.048
couple of youth knocked on the 
door and just needed a place to 

01:05:00.049 --> 01:05:01.267
hang out until their parents got

01:05:01.268 --> 01:05:02.875
home and they needed a bathroom.

01:05:02.876 --> 01:05:06.604
It was a little cold outside.  
That literally became the 

01:05:06.605 --> 01:05:12.046
foundation for our energyizeers 
program. our energyizeers 

01:05:12.047 --> 01:05:15.362
program 
serves youth 6-12 and the junior

01:05:20.105 --> 01:05:23.539
Naomomi... hi! 
She was not expecting that.  

01:05:23.540 --> 01:05:25.450
These programs are offering life

01:05:25.451 --> 01:05:28.279
skills and arts curriculum to 
help empower these youth just 

01:05:28.280 --> 01:05:31.905
like a lot of the work that you 
all do does, and give them a 

01:05:31.906 --> 01:05:34.936
good place to be and good skills
skills.  That program expands 

01:05:34.937 --> 01:05:39.062
every summer to 75 kids from the

01:05:39.063 --> 01:05:42.688
25 that we serve during the 
school year, and those kids get 

01:05:42.689 --> 01:05:45.012
five weeks of programming 
throughout the day, that's based

01:05:47.435 --> 01:05:50.471
then junior staff program they 
work throughout the year, they 

01:05:50.472 --> 01:05:52.079
have different jobs and roles in

01:05:52.080 --> 01:05:53.886
the community at Dance Place and

01:05:53.887 --> 01:05:57.109
on our arts campus.  So this is 
what our programming looks like.

01:06:01.059 --> 01:06:02.874
thinking a little more about 
this mixed neighborhood that 

01:06:02.875 --> 01:06:06.208
we're in, and the challenges 
that it presents.  I literally 

01:06:06.209 --> 01:06:09.621
had some teenage boys yell at me

01:06:09.622 --> 01:06:13.469
when I asked them to leave our 
arts park at 9:30 p.m. because 

01:06:13.470 --> 01:06:17.372
the building was closed and it 
was time to go home.  They 

01:06:17.373 --> 01:06:19.108
yelled at me... you're new here.

01:06:19.109 --> 01:06:21.543
You don't know what it's like 
here.  And I hear that, I 

01:06:21.544 --> 01:06:25.484
recognize that and I understand 
that.  And at the same time how 

01:06:25.485 --> 01:06:27.184
do we create an environment that

01:06:27.185 --> 01:06:28.596
is embraceing of them and 
embrace

01:06:28.597 --> 01:06:31.532
embracing of these challenges 
and also trying to get them to 

01:06:31.533 --> 01:06:34.049
anchor themselves and go home at

01:06:34.050 --> 01:06:37.889
night when that's appropriate.  
You know, there's a lot of 

01:06:37.890 --> 01:06:39.699
reasons why I don't want them on

01:06:39.700 --> 01:06:43.439
the street night, not just 
necessarily for what they do but

01:06:44.857 --> 01:06:48.078
these are the challenges we're 
facing there, and how can we 

01:06:48.079 --> 01:06:51.720
continue to bridge our 
curriculum in ways that bring 

01:06:51.721 --> 01:06:55.345
those different socioeconomic 
groups together.  I've anecdote

01:06:55.750 --> 01:06:57.269
al
anecdotally noticed in our 

01:06:57.270 --> 01:06:59.372
tuition-based program which grew

01:06:59.373 --> 01:07:04.012
to serve 500 youth to just 300 
two years ago that most of our 

01:07:04.013 --> 01:07:08.751
tuition-based programs racially 
look a certain way, because of 

01:07:08.752 --> 01:07:10.059
new communityies that have moved

01:07:10.060 --> 01:07:11.971
into that neighborhood and youth

01:07:11.972 --> 01:07:15.918
enrichment programs, racially 
look a different way.  How do we

01:07:17.621 --> 01:07:19.456
that and create a foundation for

01:07:19.457 --> 01:07:23.183
their futures that recognizes 
how incredibly mixed our world 

01:07:23.184 --> 01:07:27.327
is that we live in and provide 
tools within which then one or 

01:07:27.328 --> 01:07:28.934
two sentences they can recognize

01:07:28.935 --> 01:07:31.151
the history of where we are, the

01:07:31.152 --> 01:07:34.988
diversity in the room and how 
hopefully we can sense one 

01:07:34.989 --> 01:07:40.330
another.  Sensitively.
[Applause]

01:07:40.435 --> 01:07:42.435
&gt;&gt;  

01:07:45.354 --> 01:07:47.689
Christopher you make me 
think -- I think you articulate

01:07:47.893 --> 01:07:51.103
ed 
in a special way, which is, you 

01:07:51.104 --> 01:07:54.229
know, arts education -- I'm 
always a champion of working 

01:07:54.230 --> 01:07:56.157
from an assets model, right?  So

01:07:56.158 --> 01:07:58.583
the struggle, instead of, woe is

01:07:58.584 --> 01:08:00.292
me, the struggles we have, think

01:08:00.293 --> 01:08:03.734
about the power we have.  I 
think uniquely arts education 

01:08:03.735 --> 01:08:07.859
among other subjects, think 
about literacy and math et 

01:08:07.860 --> 01:08:11.296
et cetera.  Arts education is 
really so well poised, both out 

01:08:11.297 --> 01:08:16.027
of necessity but out of its 
ability to not just be about 

01:08:16.028 --> 01:08:19.265
curriculum and instruction, 
right?  Not just about what you 

01:08:19.266 --> 01:08:23.717
learn in the art form but isn't 
it about listening, right?  

01:08:23.718 --> 01:08:25.606
Isn't it about community?  Isn't

01:08:25.607 --> 01:08:29.246
it about bringing things 
together, right?  Recognizing 

01:08:29.247 --> 01:08:32.078
past, present, future.  It has 
the ability to do all these 

01:08:32.079 --> 01:08:35.698
things and sort of knit them 
together in a way that I think 

01:08:35.699 --> 01:08:39.029
really -- especially within the 
school, within a neighborhood, 

01:08:39.030 --> 01:08:43.875
within a program, it's got this 
sort of super-power, right, this

01:08:45.391 --> 01:08:47.703
perspectives and things together
together.  I don't know that 

01:08:47.704 --> 01:08:50.233
everyone looks at the other 
curricular areas in the same way

01:08:50.422 --> 01:08:53.557
way.  I appreciate your 
articulation of that.

01:08:53.583 --> 01:08:57.784
So Nathan, I've known Nathan a 
little while.  We both were in 

01:08:57.785 --> 01:09:00.323
Chicago public schools fighting 
the good fight in arts education

01:09:00.327 --> 01:09:03.346
education.  I think we're the 
two visual artists up here.

01:09:03.374 --> 01:09:06.077
&gt;&gt;  Yeah.
&gt;&gt;  So Nathan leads the Charge 

01:09:06.078 --> 01:09:10.403
and the team at D.C. Public 
Schools for arts education. so I

01:09:12.128 --> 01:09:14.752
initiatives that we're going to 
dive into, but I thought you 

01:09:14.753 --> 01:09:16.760
might just take a moment to sort

01:09:16.761 --> 01:09:18.984
of continue the conversation and

01:09:18.985 --> 01:09:23.122
talk about the work of equity 
and access in your role and with

01:09:27.274 --> 01:09:30.483
&gt;&gt;  Absolutely.  So as said, I'm

01:09:30.484 --> 01:09:33.807
the director of arts for D.C. 
Public Schools.  So in that role

01:09:37.642 --> 01:09:40.573
all disciplines in the arts.  He

01:09:40.574 --> 01:09:44.202
also mentioned I'm a visual 
artist.  My background is in 

01:09:44.203 --> 01:09:47.122
photography and design and 
prison making, but I'm actually 

01:09:47.123 --> 01:09:49.544
going to talk -- print making 
but I'm going to talk about 

01:09:49.545 --> 01:09:53.190
music initiative today.
&gt;&gt;  I'm just trying to represent

01:09:54.320 --> 01:09:58.621
&gt;&gt;  Absolutely.  And, you know, 
it's been great to listen from 

01:09:58.622 --> 01:10:03.888
Dr. Chu about the idea how we 
approach the arts as a language.

01:10:08.311 --> 01:10:12.454
sector because literacy has 
specific connotations and we are

01:10:14.563 --> 01:10:17.079
broaden the scope of what we 
talk about when we talk about 

01:10:17.080 --> 01:10:21.219
literacy in public education, 
expanding that into visual 

01:10:21.220 --> 01:10:27.171
literacy and music literacy.  
And so the role I think -- you 

01:10:27.172 --> 01:10:29.291
know, this idea of equity, these

01:10:29.292 --> 01:10:33.823
three words, equity, access, 
innovation, could not be more 

01:10:33.824 --> 01:10:37.361
gift wrapped for the work we're 
doing now, because chancellor 

01:10:37.362 --> 01:10:40.796
Wilson, chancellor of D.C. 
public schools has a really 

01:10:40.797 --> 01:10:45.720
intense focus on equity and how 
we are approaching our schools 

01:10:45.721 --> 01:10:50.262
for what they need and what the 
communities need, not just sort 

01:10:50.263 --> 01:10:53.795
of even strokes, but what 
actually do we need to give each

01:11:00.437 --> 01:11:05.375
the arts, that comes in a few 
different forms.  It's about 

01:11:05.376 --> 01:11:07.996
exposure and opportunity and I 
think those are things that sort

01:11:11.438 --> 01:11:15.061
but I think bigger than that, 
what we look at is how are we 

01:11:15.062 --> 01:11:17.798
empowering students to use their

01:11:17.799 --> 01:11:22.831
voice?  And so we talk a lot 
about the use of a student's 

01:11:22.832 --> 01:11:26.192
voice and how do we transition 
from a skills acquisition model 

01:11:26.193 --> 01:11:29.884
where we are sort of building 
students' capacity up to do 

01:11:29.885 --> 01:11:32.718
certain things as they get older
older, and more how are we 

01:11:32.719 --> 01:11:34.624
handing them these tools, giving

01:11:34.625 --> 01:11:37.153
them space to use them, to 
experiment with them, to 

01:11:37.154 --> 01:11:40.478
understand them on their own 
terms an then guiding them from 

01:11:40.479 --> 01:11:44.519
there as they get older.  So it 
is really how we're being 

01:11:44.520 --> 01:11:49.966
strategic in that process from 
pre-K through 12th grade.

01:11:49.994 --> 01:11:53.504
I think critical is, you know, 
literacy in the traditional form

01:11:55.419 --> 01:11:58.948
students to express themselves, 
how can we get them to write 

01:11:58.949 --> 01:12:03.197
ideas down and speak eloquently 
and be sure they can operate in 

01:12:03.198 --> 01:12:06.812
society, but as we know, the 
arts do that incredibly well and

01:12:09.139 --> 01:12:13.764
challengeed to be reacheded by 
traditional forms of literacy.  

01:12:13.765 --> 01:12:16.795
And so one of the things that we

01:12:16.796 --> 01:12:22.230
hold dear is that if we are not 
equitably -- equity and access, 

01:12:22.231 --> 01:12:25.854
if we're not equityably reaching

01:12:25.855 --> 01:12:28.391
students there are voices miss
missing  from our culture and 

01:12:28.392 --> 01:12:35.424
our society and if we know, 
which we do, that a lot of the 

01:12:35.425 --> 01:12:37.947
issues of success in schools, as

01:12:37.948 --> 01:12:40.577
Christopher was talking about 
even in the way he sees 

01:12:40.578 --> 01:12:44.710
differences in his populations, 
we know there are a lot of 

01:12:44.711 --> 01:12:48.339
things that fall along socio
socioeconomic lines, and so it 

01:12:48.340 --> 01:12:50.056
is clear to us -- we can look at

01:12:50.057 --> 01:12:52.373
the research and know the groups

01:12:52.374 --> 01:12:55.810
of voices that are actually 
missing from our culture that 

01:12:55.811 --> 01:12:59.435
aren't being expressed, and so 
to us the arts is such a 

01:12:59.436 --> 01:13:01.266
critical place where we have the

01:13:01.267 --> 01:13:05.282
potential to start that change, 
and Dr. Chu spoke about that 

01:13:05.283 --> 01:13:11.647
eloquently earlier.
So how we're doing this, we have

01:13:13.864 --> 01:13:16.683
half years ago when I came into 
this role, I was asked to look 

01:13:16.684 --> 01:13:21.828
at what the curriculum of DCPS 
arts is and how do we write a 

01:13:21.829 --> 01:13:28.580
curriculum for the future?
And so to Mario's point, the 

01:13:28.581 --> 01:13:31.403
arts don't live comfortably in 
the world of curriculum and 

01:13:31.404 --> 01:13:35.434
instruction the way traditional 
content areas do.  This has a 

01:13:35.435 --> 01:13:39.200
lots to do with the way we 
evaluate and test.  You guys 

01:13:39.201 --> 01:13:40.518
know.
[chuckles]

01:13:40.519 --> 01:13:43.921
Exactly.  So what we said about 
doing was changing what a 

01:13:43.922 --> 01:13:47.752
curriculum looks like.  Can it 
meet the needs of a district, 

01:13:47.753 --> 01:13:49.167
can it look like what a district

01:13:49.168 --> 01:13:54.009
needs it to look like, but also 
realistically communicate what 

01:13:54.010 --> 01:13:57.135
it actually is that happens in 
an arts classroom, what value 

01:13:57.136 --> 01:13:59.674
does art add to a student's life
life.  We createed the framework

01:14:01.891 --> 01:14:06.620
rooted in root
rooted six themes, and those 

01:14:06.621 --> 01:14:10.447
span pre-K to 12 and those are 
universal themes that we as 

01:14:10.448 --> 01:14:13.286
human beings explore throughout 
our lives, identity, interaction

01:14:13.776 --> 01:14:15.591
interaction, language, 
determination, creation and 

01:14:15.592 --> 01:14:17.512
transformation.  It is those six

01:14:17.513 --> 01:14:21.455
words that anchor all of the 
work that we do and the idea is 

01:14:21.456 --> 01:14:25.985
that while those are incredibly 
complex and deep things that we 

01:14:25.986 --> 01:14:27.291
all struggle with throughout our

01:14:27.292 --> 01:14:31.733
lives, if we can start young 
people looking at those things, 

01:14:31.734 --> 01:14:34.058
developmentally as a five
five-year-old that we are giving

01:14:35.472 --> 01:14:38.494
explore what it means to be 
human and what they would like 

01:14:38.495 --> 01:14:46.654
to discover and understand.
[ speaker off microphone ]

01:14:46.681 --> 01:14:51.690
&gt;&gt;  Certainly can.  Identity, 
interaction, language, 

01:14:51.691 --> 01:14:52.905
determination, transformation --

01:14:52.906 --> 01:14:54.906
sorry, creation and transform
transformation.

01:15:01.465 --> 01:15:05.097
The tricky part is these are 
lofty goals and the question 

01:15:05.098 --> 01:15:08.416
always comes back to:  But how 
does that get to a student who 

01:15:08.417 --> 01:15:10.847
is five years old?  Do we start 
talking to them about transform

01:15:11.168 --> 01:15:14.887
transformation?  And so I think 
what that looks like, then, is 

01:15:14.888 --> 01:15:19.921
we as the adults are putting 
these sort of larger concepts of

01:15:21.434 --> 01:15:24.559
our planning, but that doesn't 
mean that we aren't also 

01:15:24.560 --> 01:15:28.498
bringing skills development and 
strungture to a young person to 

01:15:28.499 --> 01:15:32.723
get them there, so it really is 
how we are being intentional 

01:15:32.724 --> 01:15:36.172
that by time a student leaves 
D.C. Public Schools we want them

01:15:37.668 --> 01:15:40.295
mean but we don't start there.  
With we start there in our 

01:15:40.296 --> 01:15:42.824
thinking but not with young 
people.  What it means for young

01:15:44.952 --> 01:15:48.062
an arts classroom, the first 
thing they should feel is that 

01:15:48.063 --> 01:15:50.894
what they are doing is 
meaningful and matters to them, 

01:15:50.895 --> 01:15:54.425
that it is connected to their 
life, that they feel that they 

01:15:54.426 --> 01:15:57.462
have a place in what is 
happening.  That's our entry 

01:15:57.463 --> 01:16:00.879
point.  We need to get them 
engaged in what is going on.

01:16:00.907 --> 01:16:03.018
From there we can -- it's -- you

01:16:03.019 --> 01:16:06.047
know, when you have somebody 
engaged and ready to learn, it 

01:16:06.048 --> 01:16:09.987
is much easyier to say, let's 
build some skills.  Let's have 

01:16:09.988 --> 01:16:12.295
some kind of intentional 
instruction, because now there's

01:16:15.323 --> 01:16:19.025
And then I think the most 
critical thing that we infuse 

01:16:19.026 --> 01:16:22.291
into every piece of curricular 
work we do is students must have

01:16:24.812 --> 01:16:27.749
playtime.  Technically I don't 
call it playtime.  That's what 

01:16:27.750 --> 01:16:30.650
we call it.  What I call it is 
their opportunity to experiment.

01:16:33.704 --> 01:16:37.531
things that we are asking them 
to come to terms with before -- 

01:16:37.532 --> 01:16:40.660
though is the important part -- 
before we decide to judge them. 

01:16:44.283 --> 01:16:47.531
is high stakes, we give them 
that space to play, so that we 

01:16:47.532 --> 01:16:50.448
as educators can watch and 
understand where they are, where

01:16:53.276 --> 01:16:57.307
they have -- back to the equity 
piece, they have what they need 

01:16:57.308 --> 01:16:58.416
to be successful as individuals.

01:16:58.417 --> 01:17:01.356
Lastly I think in that 
assessment role, in that time 

01:17:01.357 --> 01:17:02.765
when we're really looking at how

01:17:02.766 --> 01:17:04.575
far can you take this as a young

01:17:04.576 --> 01:17:06.893
person, we ask them to use those

01:17:06.894 --> 01:17:09.213
skills in unique situations.  We

01:17:09.214 --> 01:17:12.247
pose unique problems and ask 
them to use the skills to solve 

01:17:12.248 --> 01:17:14.466
those problems.
So what this looks like in 

01:17:14.467 --> 01:17:19.604
practice is what I was going to 
get to about music is a program 

01:17:19.605 --> 01:17:21.531
that we launched at the start of

01:17:21.532 --> 01:17:23.532
this year called D.C. Keys.

01:17:29.199 --> 01:17:30.997
And so this came from an earlier

01:17:30.998 --> 01:17:34.922
idea that I had that I was 
working on in Chicago and then 

01:17:34.923 --> 01:17:38.559
brought here, which was about a 
middle school initiative to 

01:17:38.560 --> 01:17:40.580
begin ideas of music production.

01:17:40.581 --> 01:17:44.604
How do we not just involve kids 
in traditional ensembles, but 

01:17:44.605 --> 01:17:47.230
how do we get them involved in 
the idea of production and 

01:17:47.231 --> 01:17:48.652
digital production and how do we

01:17:48.653 --> 01:17:50.358
start to bridge the relationship

01:17:50.359 --> 01:17:52.481
between what is in their 
headphones and what happens in 

01:17:52.482 --> 01:17:54.797
their music class, which both in

01:17:54.798 --> 01:17:58.327
my role in Chicago and in my 
role here there was a large 

01:17:58.328 --> 01:18:02.577
disconnect between those two 
worlds, so how do we create 

01:18:02.578 --> 01:18:03.776
bridges?  And the first step was

01:18:03.777 --> 01:18:06.516
starting to look at how the 
music that they are listening to

01:18:08.517 --> 01:18:10.948
you get involved in that 
creative process?

01:18:11.151 --> 01:18:14.676
It was an early process and like

01:18:14.677 --> 01:18:17.815
I said it grew out of something 
in Chicago, but it really -- I'm

01:18:20.236 --> 01:18:25.470
my -- what I would call my 
native discipline.  And so it 

01:18:25.471 --> 01:18:33.023
wasn't until two years ago when 
I was hiring for a music 

01:18:33.024 --> 01:18:36.362
position, and Ray Muller -- have

01:18:36.363 --> 01:18:39.583
somebody wave to over there -- 
he came in and in his interview,

01:18:41.117 --> 01:18:44.216
everything.  He said, we need to

01:18:44.217 --> 01:18:46.745
teach kids that music is a 
language, it's not something to 

01:18:46.746 --> 01:18:50.471
be repeated, and they are not 
just there to play something 

01:18:50.472 --> 01:18:55.112
that already has been written.  
It is there for them to write.  

01:18:55.113 --> 01:18:57.237
So I hired him.
[chuckles]

01:18:57.263 --> 01:18:58.949
And then I was telling him about

01:18:58.950 --> 01:19:02.593
this initiative that I had been 
working on that was struggling, 

01:19:02.594 --> 01:19:06.219
admittedly struggling, and he 
said, well, we shouldn't start 

01:19:06.220 --> 01:19:10.356
in middle school.  We should 
start in kindergarten.  It was 

01:19:10.357 --> 01:19:11.897
instantaneous.
[Applause]

01:19:11.898 --> 01:19:15.902
Absolutely.  It solved so many 
problems that I was struggling 

01:19:15.903 --> 01:19:18.732
with, but that I hadn't 
identified, which was, one, 

01:19:18.733 --> 01:19:21.264
music will be a language.  Just 
start it from the beginning so 

01:19:21.265 --> 01:19:22.973
it will be no different.  That's

01:19:22.974 --> 01:19:26.104
how it will always be taught.
Two, how do we make sure that 

01:19:26.105 --> 01:19:29.346
all of our students have 
instrumental instruction, which 

01:19:29.347 --> 01:19:31.059
is incredibly costly and there's

01:19:31.060 --> 01:19:35.094
a reason it lives in high socio
socioeconomic neighborhoods?  

01:19:35.095 --> 01:19:39.230
But in D.C. now we can say with 
12 keyboards in every school, 

01:19:39.231 --> 01:19:42.247
the keyboards we have, 24 
students can be playing at any 

01:19:42.248 --> 01:19:45.375
one time, all of our elementary 
students, 25,000 kids are 

01:19:45.376 --> 01:19:48.512
learning to play the piano as we

01:19:48.513 --> 01:19:50.442
speak.
[Applause]

01:19:50.443 --> 01:19:55.353
And so it solves that issue of 
are we insuring that young 

01:19:55.354 --> 01:19:57.572
people are learning an 
instrument and learning to 

01:19:57.573 --> 01:20:02.113
perform.  And the last piece is 
that it bridges the world of 

01:20:02.114 --> 01:20:06.967
analog and digital, right?  It 
bridges the traditional and 

01:20:06.968 --> 01:20:10.187
contemporary.  The keyboard is 
one that lives like a piano but 

01:20:10.188 --> 01:20:11.706
can be plugged into a computer. 

01:20:11.707 --> 01:20:15.139
And so then we can start this 
process which the curriculum is 

01:20:15.140 --> 01:20:17.253
rooted in composition and 
improvisation 

01:20:17.254 --> 01:20:20.592
improvisation.  So our students 
starting in kindergarten, the 

01:20:20.593 --> 01:20:23.000
end of every year, will compose.

01:20:23.001 --> 01:20:28.452
Now, we need to shift our ideas 
of what composition means, right

01:20:28.642 --> 01:20:30.158
right?  There's a new definition

01:20:30.159 --> 01:20:31.777
of composition, but we're asking

01:20:31.778 --> 01:20:37.216
them to use music as a language 
every year that.

01:20:37.246 --> 01:20:40.746
The big headline of that, the 
piece that matters most to me is

01:20:46.006 --> 01:20:48.106
as creative produceers of 
culture

01:20:48.107 --> 01:20:51.743
culture, not just consumers of 
culture.  Which is, I think, 

01:20:51.744 --> 01:20:53.273
also a big shift in what we're
ing

01:20:53.274 --> 01:20:55.588
we'ring.  We're not just -- what

01:20:55.589 --> 01:20:58.517
we're doing.  We're not just 
trying to make an audience.  

01:20:58.518 --> 01:21:01.406
We're trying to make people who 
create culture later on in life.

01:21:03.370 --> 01:21:06.902
either.  I think critical to 
this process is that we have 

01:21:06.903 --> 01:21:10.826
worked very closely with 
Washington Performing Arts, many

01:21:14.374 --> 01:21:18.795
kind of the broader music 
community and to have access to 

01:21:18.796 --> 01:21:21.326
things that as just a public 
school system we don't have 

01:21:21.327 --> 01:21:24.853
access to.  They have supported 
us in the process and worked 

01:21:24.854 --> 01:21:26.572
with our teachers and stepped up

01:21:26.573 --> 01:21:29.699
to say that they will be there 
when we figure out what it is 

01:21:29.700 --> 01:21:31.010
that we actually need from them,

01:21:31.011 --> 01:21:33.840
which I think is even more 
important.  It's like the blank 

01:21:33.841 --> 01:21:35.359
check side of it, which is like,

01:21:35.360 --> 01:21:39.295
we are here for you when you 
know what it is that you need, 

01:21:39.296 --> 01:21:42.826
just call.  To the point where 
this year they have actually 

01:21:42.827 --> 01:21:46.343
changed their capital arts 
programs to meet the needs of 

01:21:46.344 --> 01:21:48.874
our new curriculum, with an 
organization that works in so 

01:21:48.875 --> 01:21:52.704
many of our schools, that's a 
critical relationship that we 

01:21:52.705 --> 01:21:56.559
have that we can start to mold 
how the two organizations work 

01:21:56.560 --> 01:22:00.969
together.
So to wrap up, I really want you

01:22:03.797 --> 01:22:05.797
student here with us,

01:22:08.540 --> 01:22:12.656
 Jos  Andr  
Monta o, School Without Walls at

01:22:15.756 --> 01:22:19.703
pianoist, a composeer, just an 
an 

01:22:19.704 --> 01:22:23.308
incredible musician and he 
really -- his work exemplifies 

01:22:23.309 --> 01:22:29.985
what I am talking about, which 
is how does music act as an 

01:22:29.986 --> 01:22:32.718
individual voice?  How do you 
create it so that it is your 

01:22:32.719 --> 01:22:35.033
voice?  And so I'm going to turn

01:22:35.034 --> 01:22:38.564
it over to Jos  Andr  to perform

01:22:38.565 --> 01:22:42.500
so you can mare what it is that 
drives us in my organization to 

01:22:42.501 --> 01:22:47.842
do the work we're doing for all 
of the young people in D.C. 

01:22:47.843 --> 01:22:49.684
Public Schools.
[Applause]

01:22:49.685 --> 01:22:53.408
&gt;&gt;  Let's hear it for Jos ! 
[Applause]

01:23:08.297 --> 01:23:13.533
&gt;&gt;  Hey, everyone! My name is 
Jos  Monta o.  Thank you for 

01:23:13.534 --> 01:23:18.478
inviting me to the Library of 
Congress, for inviting me to 

01:23:18.479 --> 01:23:23.012
play for you.  It's an honor to 
play for you and I'm really 

01:23:23.013 --> 01:23:30.278
happy to be here with you.
So I wanted to show you -- I 

01:23:30.279 --> 01:23:38.733
want to play a song that I 
really likeed it, and to all the

01:23:42.465 --> 01:23:51.234
me.  I want to show you how to 
do, like, Nathan was talking 

01:23:51.235 --> 01:23:57.670
about, how to do, like -- how to

01:23:57.671 --> 01:24:04.817
make a new composition, right?  
So I will show you some music 

01:24:04.818 --> 01:24:12.574
for you and this song is called 
Sentimental Moon.  I hope you 

01:24:12.575 --> 01:24:15.029
enjoy it.

01:24:26.356 --> 01:24:29.591
[ piano playing ]

01:28:29.918 --> 01:28:33.764
[Applause]
&gt;&gt;  Bravo! 

01:28:33.804 --> 01:28:35.804
[Applause]

01:28:40.701 --> 01:28:42.701
&gt;&gt;  Thank you.  Thank you very 
much.

01:28:48.656 --> 01:28:50.656
&gt;&gt;  

01:28:52.889 --> 01:28:56.220
Thank you Jose.  We're going 
to invite you to join us on 

01:28:56.221 --> 01:28:58.230
stage.
&gt;&gt;  Okay.  Of course.

01:28:58.255 --> 01:29:01.702
&gt;&gt;  While we do that, could we 
get a round of applause for Jose

01:29:01.753 --> 01:29:05.704
Jose's mom and dad, who always 
support him.

01:29:05.728 --> 01:29:07.728
[Applause]

01:29:12.949 --> 01:29:17.189
&gt;&gt;  Thank you.  I feel really 
lucky.  Jose has had a 

01:29:17.190 --> 01:29:19.501
relationship with us at the 
Kennedy Center for a number of 

01:29:19.502 --> 01:29:23.095
years and I just got to see you 
perform with Renee Fleming a 

01:29:23.096 --> 01:29:28.375
couple weeks ago and I think he 
stole all the attention.  This 

01:29:28.376 --> 01:29:31.511
kid is a rock star.  We would 
love to bring you into the 

01:29:31.512 --> 01:29:35.542
conversation, Jose, and if you 
could talk a little bit about 

01:29:35.543 --> 01:29:41.191
music in your life and the 
importance of it.

01:29:41.217 --> 01:29:49.951
&gt;&gt;  Okay.  Music is important 
for me because I think music -- 

01:29:49.952 --> 01:29:56.212
it's a feeling.  It's a feeling 
for me, and it brings you a lot 

01:29:56.213 --> 01:30:02.156
of feelings.  It's really hard 
to explain.  But it's important 

01:30:02.157 --> 01:30:06.577
for me because, for a school, it

01:30:06.578 --> 01:30:08.809
helps me improve my education at

01:30:08.810 --> 01:30:10.810
school.  It helps

01:30:12.419 --> 01:30:18.268
 me to get 
things that I never got before 

01:30:18.269 --> 01:30:25.234
and that makes me really happy, 
because that is part of -- it 

01:30:25.235 --> 01:30:27.537
inspires me to

01:30:30.844 --> 01:30:33.869
 feel doing what 
I'm doing.  And as you can see 

01:30:33.870 --> 01:30:39.393
in the song I just played, it 
brings you that feeling, right?

01:30:40.112 --> 01:30:46.264
&gt;&gt;  Yes.
&gt;&gt;  It has to be -- it's really 

01:30:46.265 --> 01:30:48.118
hard to explain.  Like you have 
to --

01:30:48.119 --> 01:30:53.422
&gt;&gt;  You're doing great.
&gt;&gt;  You make the music while 

01:30:53.423 --> 01:30:58.875
you're playing, and then when I 
finish answering that question 

01:30:58.876 --> 01:31:02.407
question -- when I finish 
answering the whole question, I 

01:31:02.408 --> 01:31:07.452
will show you the same song but 
a little bit more faster, so we 

01:31:07.453 --> 01:31:14.280
can see the difference how you 
can transmit a little bit more 

01:31:14.281 --> 01:31:16.608
better your music.
&gt;&gt;  And I wonder if you might...

01:31:18.420 --> 01:31:22.464
own, you compose.  There one 
that you ear working on now or a

01:31:24.278 --> 01:31:27.309
on?
&gt;&gt;  Yeah.  I already have some 

01:31:27.310 --> 01:31:33.150
compositions and a couple days 
ago, like on Friday -- yeah, on 

01:31:33.151 --> 01:31:41.121
Friday, I composed a new 
composition that it's called -- 

01:31:41.122 --> 01:31:45.249
for my friend Colin, for my 
friend from school, one of my 

01:31:45.250 --> 01:31:49.199
best friends, and a couple days 
I composed a song, but it's a 

01:31:49.200 --> 01:31:52.420
surprise for minimum.
&gt;&gt;  Okay.  Great.  Awesome.  We 

01:31:52.421 --> 01:31:55.956
won't ask more so it can stay a 
surprise.  Jose, I'm hoping 

01:31:55.957 --> 01:31:58.782
you'll stay with us on stage a 
few minutes and maybe we can end

01:32:00.199 --> 01:32:02.510
going to show us another way to 
do it?

01:32:02.539 --> 01:32:04.841
&gt;&gt;  Yep.
&gt;&gt;  So a few minutes of patience

01:32:05.660 --> 01:32:09.582
&gt;&gt;  Yeah, it's okay.
&gt;&gt;  Thank you.  Because to your 

01:32:09.583 --> 01:32:12.327
right we have Asha, who has been

01:32:12.328 --> 01:32:16.079
patiently waiting.  I'm so glad 
you joined us, Asha Gardner from

01:32:18.965 --> 01:32:21.080
to have you jump in the 
conversation.  We know you were 

01:32:21.081 --> 01:32:23.921
born and raised in D.C., right?
&gt;&gt;  Uh-huh.

01:32:23.948 --> 01:32:25.325
&gt;&gt;  Spoken word is a big part of

01:32:25.326 --> 01:32:28.766
your life and you grew up with 
the program and as well as 

01:32:28.767 --> 01:32:30.577
working with it now.  Welcome to

01:32:30.578 --> 01:32:35.434
the conversation.
&gt;&gt;  Hi, guys.  I'm Asha fard 

01:32:35.435 --> 01:32:40.652
never.  I do work with Split 
this Rock.  For the past seven 

01:32:40.653 --> 01:32:45.900
years, since I was 15 -- you 
guys do the math yourselves, you

01:32:49.327 --> 01:32:54.256
programs with youth, for all 
over the city with, I don't know

01:32:54.762 --> 01:32:58.999
know, Split This Rock.  I 
started in high school.  In high

01:33:02.433 --> 01:33:06.988
what I think, I know what I want
want, I know what I need, and I 

01:33:06.989 --> 01:33:10.807
have to voice it, right?  But in

01:33:10.808 --> 01:33:14.530
schools there can be a definite 
structure as to how one can 

01:33:14.531 --> 01:33:18.861
present those needs or how one 
can communicate their feelings 

01:33:18.862 --> 01:33:21.595
or tell your teacher what you 
went through at home the other 

01:33:21.596 --> 01:33:24.123
day, you know?  And I felt for a

01:33:24.124 --> 01:33:28.559
while that -- I feel there was 
like a disconnect.  I felt like 

01:33:28.560 --> 01:33:32.487
my school had counselors and 
deans of students and vice 

01:33:32.488 --> 01:33:36.026
principals, but there was no 
language to use between us that 

01:33:36.027 --> 01:33:40.673
would, like, effectively get my 
point across, you know, to let 

01:33:40.674 --> 01:33:43.688
them know that, you know, my 
heart hurts today, and I'm sorry

01:33:45.618 --> 01:33:51.362
much.  And I found a really 
great sponsor in my building, 

01:33:51.363 --> 01:33:54.890
she was actually the librarian 
librarian -- doubles as my mom 

01:33:54.891 --> 01:33:57.002
mom -- so that's why she was the

01:33:57.003 --> 01:34:01.672
best person in the building.  
But I kind of found home in the 

01:34:01.673 --> 01:34:04.872
librairie, you know, and there 
was a space where I was sitting 

01:34:04.873 --> 01:34:09.603
and looking through books and 
everything.  It was a space I 

01:34:09.604 --> 01:34:12.341
could be like, I trust you, you 
know, you're an adult in the 

01:34:12.342 --> 01:34:13.855
building I can trust, aside from

01:34:13.856 --> 01:34:18.092
the fact that we're related, 
could you please, like, you know

01:34:18.207 --> 01:34:21.027
know, listen to me talk about 
the things I'm going through 

01:34:21.028 --> 01:34:24.643
just for a second?  You know, 
just with my friends and other 

01:34:24.644 --> 01:34:25.759
things.  And she would listen to

01:34:25.760 --> 01:34:28.285
me all the time but she would 
always in the conversation be 

01:34:28.286 --> 01:34:32.124
like, this is not what I'm here 
for.  I'm a librarian.  This is 

01:34:32.125 --> 01:34:36.764
what I'm supposed to be doing.  
And she challengeed me one day. 

01:34:38.158 --> 01:34:41.106
club.  You and all your friends 
come here and sit around and you

01:34:44.730 --> 01:34:48.362
together, so why not make it a 
real club, you know?  And we 

01:34:48.363 --> 01:34:52.110
were like, wow, that's a really 
great concept.  What kind of 

01:34:52.111 --> 01:34:54.125
club can we start to, like, talk

01:34:54.126 --> 01:35:00.889
about our emotions and things?  
And this -- I don't know, the 

01:35:00.890 --> 01:35:04.814
spirit of art was in the 
building because Split This Rock

01:35:06.731 --> 01:35:10.057
opening up their new youth 
programming with D.C. Slam Team 

01:35:10.058 --> 01:35:14.389
and bringing back all of their 
big movements  in the city and 

01:35:14.390 --> 01:35:18.123
she offered us this opportunity 
to be like -- start your own 

01:35:18.124 --> 01:35:22.970
poetry club, you know?  And I 
was like... poetry clubs... 

01:35:22.971 --> 01:35:26.387
[chuckles]... I'm thinking 
Shakespeare and Robert Frost and

01:35:29.920 --> 01:35:32.234
like huh, huh, huh... this is so

01:35:32.235 --> 01:35:33.075
cool.
[ Laughter ]

01:35:33.076 --> 01:35:38.487
And we were not entertained.
And honestly it didn't seem like

01:35:39.807 --> 01:35:42.247
around to.  I felt limiting, you

01:35:42.248 --> 01:35:46.170
know.  And this idea of spoken 
word poetry came about and she 

01:35:46.171 --> 01:35:49.080
brought these artists to the 
building to present their 

01:35:49.081 --> 01:35:53.533
program to us.  To kind of give 
us a buy-in, this is why you 

01:35:53.534 --> 01:36:00.593
should house our program.  And 
there was an artist, Rasheed Con

01:36:00.796 --> 01:36:06.327
Coneland and he did an amazing 
poem about his sister.  I watch

01:36:06.638 --> 01:36:10.973
watched myself and friends, we 
were theater kids.  We were a 

01:36:10.974 --> 01:36:12.190
little giggley and we were like,

01:36:12.191 --> 01:36:14.905
we can't sit still, we can't 
help ourselves.  About three 

01:36:14.906 --> 01:36:16.532
minutes, this poem was no longer

01:36:16.533 --> 01:36:19.562
than three minutes, we were 
stuck.  We were encapsulateed in

01:36:21.172 --> 01:36:25.105
emotions.  We understood his 
relationship with his sister by 

01:36:25.106 --> 01:36:30.947
the end of the poem, and we sat 
around together, more so me 

01:36:30.948 --> 01:36:32.875
because I kind of dragged all my

01:36:32.876 --> 01:36:35.706
friends into this poetry club 
business, and we were kind of 

01:36:35.707 --> 01:36:43.357
like, we can do this.  And at 
the time, our high school, as 

01:36:43.358 --> 01:36:46.775
minority students over in 
Woodrow Wilson senior high 

01:36:46.776 --> 01:36:50.110
school there wasn't a big place 
for us in our musical theater 

01:36:50.111 --> 01:36:53.753
program.  It was unfortunate, 
but we had -- we felt like we 

01:36:53.754 --> 01:36:57.074
had all this art in us and no 
place to put it out.  We were 

01:36:57.075 --> 01:36:59.639
like, Spoken Word sounds nothing

01:36:59.640 --> 01:37:01.418
like monologues to me, you know?

01:37:01.419 --> 01:37:02.437
This sounds like something I can

01:37:02.438 --> 01:37:07.077
do, you know.  And personally I 
was jazz trained and singing, a 

01:37:07.078 --> 01:37:09.701
lot of friends were trained in 
singing and we found all these 

01:37:09.702 --> 01:37:11.518
places where all these different

01:37:11.519 --> 01:37:17.262
art forms can meet in lyricism, 
simply lyricism.  Call it poetry

01:37:26.435 --> 01:37:28.059
feels like.  Let me let you feel

01:37:28.060 --> 01:37:29.981
it too, you know.  So we started

01:37:29.982 --> 01:37:33.501
this poetry club and spoken word

01:37:33.502 --> 01:37:37.032
was our thing, we taught 
ourselves how to do spoken word 

01:37:37.033 --> 01:37:40.656
poetry and we prideed ourselves 
in how far we had come with it 

01:37:40.657 --> 01:37:45.891
and this new era, this new lane 
opened up.  It went from spoken 

01:37:45.892 --> 01:37:47.811
word poetry, we went from poetry

01:37:47.812 --> 01:37:51.745
on the page, all that good stuff
stuff, to like this cool modern 

01:37:51.746 --> 01:37:56.590
twist on it, you know, more 
vocal, more active, to this 

01:37:56.591 --> 01:38:00.029
competitive part, right?  Mind 
you, we're theater kids.  We 

01:38:00.030 --> 01:38:03.152
don't do sports.  We don't have 
a sports team that we can, like,

01:38:06.687 --> 01:38:12.142
like... competition, you say?  
And slam poetry came into play. 

01:38:15.150 --> 01:38:18.885
basically individual students, 
groups of students, teams, 

01:38:18.886 --> 01:38:23.715
whatever, get together in a 
community setting, like an open 

01:38:23.716 --> 01:38:26.951
mic but instead of everybody 
going on stage and just, you 

01:38:26.952 --> 01:38:30.682
know, delivering their emotions 
or their pieces, we add a little

01:38:33.518 --> 01:38:36.951
we say, how much effort did you 
put into it?  Did you really 

01:38:36.952 --> 01:38:39.577
believe the words you said?  
Have I heard that poem before?  

01:38:39.578 --> 01:38:42.202
You know, little -- all these 
things start to matter, you know

01:38:42.393 --> 01:38:45.223
know, and we start to hold 
ourselves accountable for the 

01:38:45.224 --> 01:38:47.263
artists we're building ourselves

01:38:47.264 --> 01:38:50.876
into, and we like that challenge
challenge.  You know, we felt we

01:38:51.985 --> 01:38:54.106
challenge for a very long time. 

01:38:54.107 --> 01:39:02.064
So Split This Rock started, a 
bomb DMV competition.  It 

01:39:02.065 --> 01:39:04.480
started in Chicago among Chicago

01:39:04.481 --> 01:39:08.920
city public schools, and it 
createed this cool place for all

01:39:14.965 --> 01:39:20.808
like -- whelk it is something 
like people from southeast, 

01:39:20.809 --> 01:39:24.432
northeast, northwest, you know, 
everyone coming together for a 

01:39:24.433 --> 01:39:27.872
weekend, one weekend.  So every 
high school being present, every

01:39:33.336 --> 01:39:36.546
of life from your city is 
present.  And they're all in 

01:39:36.547 --> 01:39:39.879
your age range.  And you guys 
are expressing yourselves and 

01:39:39.880 --> 01:39:43.513
exchanging thoughts and what 
your view is on your life, you 

01:39:43.514 --> 01:39:46.840
know, in the city, and you guys 
look around and you're like, wow

01:39:47.036 --> 01:39:50.072
wow, we're not so much -- we're 
not as different as we thought 

01:39:50.073 --> 01:39:53.715
we were.  And we have elders -- 
I call them elders, the teachers

01:39:54.423 --> 01:39:58.436
teachers, the sponsors, to be 
given that term with respect 

01:39:58.437 --> 01:40:03.683
because you guys harness an 
environment, you as are 

01:40:03.684 --> 01:40:05.401
responsible for this environment
environment, where students come

01:40:09.329 --> 01:40:12.870
part of themselves that in most 
cases if they didn't have art 

01:40:12.871 --> 01:40:14.469
would be silent, you know, would

01:40:14.470 --> 01:40:15.997
never be brought to the surface,

01:40:15.998 --> 01:40:19.426
you know, and you guys are 
delegating and helping them, 

01:40:19.427 --> 01:40:22.551
holding their hands and letting 
them know, hey, I saw a kid who 

01:40:22.552 --> 01:40:25.886
did a poem like yours.  I think 
you might like them.  Go check 

01:40:25.887 --> 01:40:31.141
them out.  And, look, there's a 
bond, across-town bond started 

01:40:31.142 --> 01:40:34.667
that turns into a friendship 
that lasts forever.  So kind of 

01:40:34.668 --> 01:40:40.105
talk more on what I feel like, 
you know, art brings -- arts 

01:40:40.106 --> 01:40:43.028
programming, it's this 
opportunity, you know, for 

01:40:43.029 --> 01:40:49.281
students to apply to challenge 
themselves, you know, to try 

01:40:49.282 --> 01:40:52.511
community, you know, step 
outside of their comfort zone, 

01:40:52.512 --> 01:40:55.330
because I like to think that a 
lot of times artists aren't 

01:40:55.331 --> 01:41:00.470
always the most -- I don't want 
to say "normal people"."  We 

01:41:00.471 --> 01:41:05.217
don't always, like, fit in all 
the time.  And that can be very 

01:41:05.218 --> 01:41:07.145
very -- you know, it can put you

01:41:07.146 --> 01:41:11.964
in a very isolateed place.  It 
could be socially traumatic to a

01:41:14.502 --> 01:41:20.233
long-term, as you build 
yourselves into an adult or 

01:41:20.234 --> 01:41:23.171
whatever, you have all these 
issues, you know, because you 

01:41:23.172 --> 01:41:28.503
never solved your problem, and 
we're having this opportunity to

01:41:30.308 --> 01:41:32.528
addressing 
issues while they're fresh, you 

01:41:32.529 --> 01:41:37.573
know, and they're young, and 
there are people, sponsors, 

01:41:37.574 --> 01:41:41.403
teachers, program directors, 
there are teaching artists who 

01:41:41.404 --> 01:41:45.438
are responsible for making sure 
that that process goes as less 

01:41:45.439 --> 01:41:50.282
rocky as possible, you know?
So what I do now is I am a 

01:41:50.283 --> 01:41:53.512
teaching artist in these schools
schools.  I've gone through the 

01:41:53.513 --> 01:41:58.449
programs, I have done the slams 
and performing and spoken word, 

01:41:58.450 --> 01:42:00.657
and now I've seen an opportunity

01:42:00.658 --> 01:42:05.104
to go back and teach, you know, 
students what I know.  I felt 

01:42:05.105 --> 01:42:09.736
like I made it -- I got so many 
opportunities and made it so far

01:42:12.259 --> 01:42:15.393
expressing myself.  You know, by

01:42:15.394 --> 01:42:21.229
feeling these limits and bonds 
fall off of me, that I felt the 

01:42:21.230 --> 01:42:24.558
need -- I don't know why there's

01:42:24.559 --> 01:42:27.166
a student in D.C. who isn't in a

01:42:27.167 --> 01:42:32.212
program, honestly.  Or on a real
realer note, I am from D.C., 

01:42:32.213 --> 01:42:35.250
third generation Washington, 
Washington, D.C., Washington 

01:42:35.251 --> 01:42:40.188
toneian, and I've grown up with 
students with young people, with

01:42:41.387 --> 01:42:42.901
over the city, from all over the

01:42:42.902 --> 01:42:48.235
country who do have -- who come 
from all areas of the economic 

01:42:48.236 --> 01:42:52.487
ladder, from all areas of 
religions and walks of life, all

01:42:56.704 --> 01:43:00.433
of any of those things or how 
they differentiate, one thing we

01:43:04.567 --> 01:43:08.929
to do with our free time.  It's 
so easy for us to get in trouble

01:43:09.003 --> 01:43:14.047
trouble.  I mean, not kind of 
like funny trouble, I mean the 

01:43:14.048 --> 01:43:16.777
kind of trouble that doesn't 
allow us to come home ever again

01:43:16.989 --> 01:43:20.608
again, you know.  And as a youth

01:43:20.609 --> 01:43:23.734
in the last two years, I've lost

01:43:23.735 --> 01:43:27.966
friends, you know, in the 
streets and around in front of 

01:43:27.967 --> 01:43:31.004
their homes, you know, in front 
of their neighborhoods and I 

01:43:31.005 --> 01:43:32.702
think to myself oftentimes, like

01:43:32.703 --> 01:43:36.441
if they had a program, if they 
had a sponsor, if they had a 

01:43:36.442 --> 01:43:39.357
mentor, if they had somebody who

01:43:39.358 --> 01:43:43.494
could keep their mind and keep 
them busy or something else, 

01:43:43.495 --> 01:43:46.314
would they still be here?  So I 
thought, that's the severity and

01:43:47.936 --> 01:43:50.661
what we do here.
&gt;&gt;  Thank you for that.

01:43:50.686 --> 01:43:53.013
[Applause]

01:44:01.124 --> 01:44:06.764
&gt;&gt;  I really love what you said 
about the cross-town bond.  I 

01:44:06.765 --> 01:44:08.279
know that really well.  And what

01:44:08.280 --> 01:44:11.215
I want to paint a picture for 
the room is if you haven't been 

01:44:11.216 --> 01:44:15.638
to one of these poetry slam 
competitions, it is the most 

01:44:15.639 --> 01:44:22.092
supportive house of kids that 
you have ever found.  Like I've 

01:44:22.093 --> 01:44:25.921
been in 2,000 high schools in 
Chicago, from every neighborhood

01:44:26.125 --> 01:44:29.953
neighborhood, and they are only 
supportive of whoever is on 

01:44:29.954 --> 01:44:33.795
stage even though it's a 
competition.  And I've adopted 

01:44:33.796 --> 01:44:37.824
this -- I use this all the time 
because it's a way to so support

01:44:39.845 --> 01:44:43.628
struggling but already sort of 
of -- I don't want to call it a 

01:44:43.629 --> 01:44:47.827
milder round of applause, but it
it's like a low hum of support 

01:44:47.828 --> 01:44:50.042
to let people know you've got 
their back.

01:44:50.069 --> 01:44:51.556
&gt;&gt;  When someone is on stage and

01:44:51.557 --> 01:44:54.376
performing and you get really 
moved because that's what we aim

01:44:56.395 --> 01:44:59.637
your seats.  I'm like, oh, my 
God, that was great! 

01:44:59.663 --> 01:45:02.871
It's kind of disrespectful to 
step up in someone's home and be

01:45:06.499 --> 01:45:09.843
awesome! And they're still 
talking.  We have a thing in our

01:45:13.761 --> 01:45:16.888
appreciateed, you are being 
received, I am listening.  So 

01:45:16.889 --> 01:45:21.436
snapping is one thing we do.  
Another thing, if you're in a 

01:45:21.437 --> 01:45:25.274
poetry area, you can do like a 
sweet chocolate noise, like if 

01:45:25.275 --> 01:45:28.798
you have a last piece of 
chocolate on a bar and you're 

01:45:28.799 --> 01:45:32.441
like ummm... we like the sweet 
chocolate.  And there's a new 

01:45:32.442 --> 01:45:36.363
thing that the community has 
adapted is an awkward draft, you

01:45:38.497 --> 01:45:40.919
like... yes! 
Little things.  There are cool 

01:45:40.920 --> 01:45:43.635
mannerisms we have in the arts 
community that are teaching 

01:45:43.636 --> 01:45:47.081
people how to, like, appreciate 
their neighbors, you know, and 

01:45:47.082 --> 01:45:49.603
how to respect, you know, 
someone who is speaking, you 

01:45:49.604 --> 01:45:53.531
know, all of these -- the parts 
of, I don't know, being a 

01:45:53.532 --> 01:45:55.971
citizen, being humane in the 
world.

01:45:55.997 --> 01:46:01.598
&gt;&gt;  Really lovely.  Thank you.
[Applause]

01:46:01.622 --> 01:46:07.248
Rhona I think we need a cross-
cross-collaborateive project to 

01:46:07.249 --> 01:46:10.172
work on, because these guys are 
such rock stars and I feel like 

01:46:10.173 --> 01:46:13.682
we could stackle anything.  
We're going to get to a couple 

01:46:13.683 --> 01:46:20.213
Q&amp;A in a moment.  I just am 
going to start to once again 

01:46:20.214 --> 01:46:20.659
knit together this conversation,

01:46:20.660 --> 01:46:24.290
which I think is connected, but 
you're hearing from different 

01:46:24.291 --> 01:46:26.718
perspectives about really the 
necessity of the arts in 

01:46:26.719 --> 01:46:33.057
everyone's lives.  And I was 
thrilled that Jane Chu talked 

01:46:33.058 --> 01:46:36.406
about our Any Given Child 
program in D.C. that has really 

01:46:36.407 --> 01:46:39.832
been a work in progress for many
many, many years.  We have a 

01:46:39.833 --> 01:46:42.137
unique window of opportunity for

01:46:42.138 --> 01:46:46.284
every sector of the community 
coming together and say, how do 

01:46:46.285 --> 01:46:49.297
we priorityize arts education in

01:46:49.298 --> 01:46:51.713
D.C.? and part of the work to do

01:46:51.714 --> 01:46:58.467
that is to look honestly at the 
data which -- and data is a 

01:46:58.468 --> 01:47:00.999
listening tour, hearing 
communities, hearing voices, 

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:04.121
looking at numbers, looking at 
maps of the city and analyzing 

01:47:04.122 --> 01:47:08.063
the gaps and the saturation 
points and also looking at 

01:47:08.064 --> 01:47:12.588
research and best practice.  It 
really kind of marries these 

01:47:12.589 --> 01:47:15.323
things together.  I would urge 
you to keep it on your radar and

01:47:18.768 --> 01:47:19.873
that is happening right now that

01:47:19.874 --> 01:47:23.494
takes this kind of conversation 
and puts it into an actual 

01:47:23.495 --> 01:47:27.842
structure.  And I think, you 
know, if I add anything to this 

01:47:27.843 --> 01:47:29.749
conversation, you know, I get so

01:47:29.750 --> 01:47:33.790
inspired but also I laugh.  I 
worked in school districts my 

01:47:33.791 --> 01:47:37.031
whole life, right?  Working at 
central office, they mostly 

01:47:37.032 --> 01:47:41.768
needed me to be the creative 
individual, right?  Bringing a 

01:47:41.769 --> 01:47:43.689
different kind of solution to a 
problem and put that creativity 

01:47:43.690 --> 01:47:46.908
into a structure, but now at a 
performing arts organization 

01:47:46.909 --> 01:47:49.844
they only need my structure.
[chuckles]

01:47:49.870 --> 01:47:53.268
But those that are sort of the 
structure heads in the house, 

01:47:53.269 --> 01:47:58.503
that is important too.  You know
know, I hear Nathan talk, when I

01:48:00.718 --> 01:48:04.766
systems, the networks, the role 
of mentors, the building of 

01:48:04.767 --> 01:48:07.778
those constructs is also an art 
form and really critical because

01:48:09.495 --> 01:48:12.345
concert, right?
So a couple minutes for 

01:48:12.346 --> 01:48:14.749
questions.  Anyone have 
something that they want to 

01:48:14.750 --> 01:48:19.989
direct to the whole panel or to 
somebody individual?  Feel free 

01:48:19.990 --> 01:48:25.525
to raise a hand or stand up.
Oh, great.  We have a couple mic

01:48:25.644 --> 01:48:28.658
mics.  Yes, Jenny.  So if we can

01:48:28.659 --> 01:48:31.797
get a mic to come around to the 
second row in the middle.  Thank

01:48:41.453 --> 01:48:44.170
&gt;&gt;  First of all, thank you, 
especially to the youngest 

01:48:44.171 --> 01:48:47.407
members of the panel for your 
eloquence and for really walking

01:48:49.829 --> 01:48:53.861
We've talked a great deal about 
teachers, about institutions, 

01:48:53.862 --> 01:48:59.405
about individual artists, but I 
would love to hear how you feel 

01:48:59.406 --> 01:49:01.435
parts can be more involved in 
the equation, because I think 

01:49:01.436 --> 01:49:05.962
many of us who have children or 
who have children, who have 

01:49:05.963 --> 01:49:09.499
friends with children in public 
schools especially wonder what 

01:49:09.500 --> 01:49:12.327
their role is and how they can 
be active, and your mention of 

01:49:12.328 --> 01:49:16.548
your mom having these two roles 
sort of reminded me to insert 

01:49:16.549 --> 01:49:18.198
that question into the 
conversation.

01:49:18.199 --> 01:49:23.706
&gt;&gt;  Great.  Thank you.  Who 
wants to tackle this one?

01:49:23.732 --> 01:49:29.467
&gt;&gt;  I don't mind.  I think 
parents are a necessity to all 

01:49:29.468 --> 01:49:33.499
of the process, to -- that they 
bridge the gap between the arts 

01:49:33.500 --> 01:49:36.526
and the education, you know, 
they are the story, they are the

01:49:39.453 --> 01:49:43.480
themselves in the first place, 
and I think the most crucial 

01:49:43.481 --> 01:49:47.726
part to that, which we lack 
frequently is presence of those 

01:49:47.727 --> 01:49:51.951
parents.  If you know your 
student is involved in a program

01:49:52.359 --> 01:49:55.593
program, urge yourself, you know
know, urge your student to be, 

01:49:55.594 --> 01:49:59.826
you know, open to you being 
there, you know, show up, you 

01:49:59.827 --> 01:50:02.546
know, leave them a note and let 
them know that you're proud of 

01:50:02.547 --> 01:50:05.686
them just for, like, prepareing 
themselves for the day.  There 

01:50:05.687 --> 01:50:10.534
are so many ways a parent can 
put a foot, a hand, a finger, 

01:50:10.535 --> 01:50:14.870
you know, in the child's, like, 
developmental process, and it 

01:50:14.871 --> 01:50:19.922
doesn't stop at home.Itis a 
constant process until they 

01:50:19.923 --> 01:50:21.842
leave the nest, you know.  And I

01:50:21.843 --> 01:50:26.464
think not just -- not just all 
along the way, but with students

01:50:26.675 --> 01:50:28.283
students -- I'm sorry, teachers,

01:50:28.284 --> 01:50:33.127
I think it's sometimes what we 
do is keep the parents away from

01:50:35.144 --> 01:50:38.062
because it can be scary to have 
the parents around you never 

01:50:38.063 --> 01:50:40.505
know how they're going to react.

01:50:40.506 --> 01:50:44.323
I've dealt with a few scary 
parents already in my teaching 

01:50:44.324 --> 01:50:49.266
years, you know, and I can, you 
know, resonate with that.  It 

01:50:49.267 --> 01:50:51.780
can be very terrifying, but you 
have to be open, because those 

01:50:51.781 --> 01:50:54.608
are the people that made the 
student that you love and that 

01:50:54.609 --> 01:50:57.030
you are watching and is watching

01:50:57.031 --> 01:51:01.168
over you, you know.
&gt;&gt;  Really carveing out that 

01:51:01.169 --> 01:51:03.291
role 
and including them as well.

01:51:03.332 --> 01:51:05.314
&gt;&gt;  Definitely.
&gt;&gt;  I can share a personal 

01:51:05.315 --> 01:51:10.042
example.  I'm from the Ukraine 
and started lessons at age 7, as

01:51:12.896 --> 01:51:15.589
first five years I took lessons 
my grandma was in there every 

01:51:15.590 --> 01:51:17.210
lesson writing in a red notebook

01:51:17.211 --> 01:51:20.641
that I still have, very large, 
hard to read handwriting, taking

01:51:22.354 --> 01:51:25.184
and then I was required to 
review it when I came home.  And

01:51:30.938 --> 01:51:33.969
definitely formative for me.  I 
feel very lucky.

01:51:33.998 --> 01:51:37.595
&gt;&gt;  One more response for the 
panel.

01:51:37.623 --> 01:51:39.514
&gt;&gt;  From an institutional 
standpoint, what are the 

01:51:39.515 --> 01:51:42.142
mechanisms we can put in place 
when it's difficult for parents 

01:51:42.143 --> 01:51:46.679
to show up?  So how do we find 
ways to support them?  How do we

01:51:49.211 --> 01:51:52.925
Because sometimes they can also 
feel like arts -- after school 

01:51:52.926 --> 01:51:56.360
arts programming can start to 
feel like day care and there's a

01:51:59.299 --> 01:52:00.795
institutions like public schools

01:52:00.796 --> 01:52:02.714
that often have sign-out systems

01:52:02.715 --> 01:52:05.342
for young people because of 
protecting them, can we 

01:52:05.343 --> 01:52:08.965
institute that, so the parents 
have to come in and just brief 

01:52:08.966 --> 01:52:12.401
as that is, have point of 
contact and engagement.  And 

01:52:12.402 --> 01:52:15.636
also we start looking at young 
people that become deeply 

01:52:15.637 --> 01:52:18.964
invested in artistic practice 
and considering that for their 

01:52:18.965 --> 01:52:21.702
futures, how do we support them 
in the tough conversations with 

01:52:21.703 --> 01:52:23.014
their parents that sometimes are

01:52:23.015 --> 01:52:26.932
fearful of what a future in the 
arts looks like.  The future in 

01:52:26.933 --> 01:52:29.557
the arts looks like this, it's 
bright and beautiful and support

01:52:29.874 --> 01:52:33.400
supported.  It's not easy but it
it's viable.  And so I totally 

01:52:33.401 --> 01:52:34.626
understand.  My parents were not

01:52:34.627 --> 01:52:36.640
sold on it for years even when I

01:52:36.641 --> 01:52:39.864
was making money as an artist, 
they still were not sold on it. 

01:52:42.078 --> 01:52:44.298
helped support that conversation
conversation, we as institutions

01:52:46.221 --> 01:52:47.846
ways to help smooth that as well

01:52:47.847 --> 01:52:50.467
as inviting them in and trying 
to get them to be present.

01:52:50.764 --> 01:52:54.502
&gt;&gt;  Thank you.  Great.  Another 
question, looks like you're 

01:52:54.503 --> 01:52:58.838
ready over here.
&gt;&gt;  Yes, I have two questions, 

01:52:58.839 --> 01:53:02.777
if that's okay, and the first 
question is directed to Jane Chu

01:53:06.017 --> 01:53:07.831
&gt;&gt;  Nope.
&gt;&gt;  Well, maybe somebody can 

01:53:07.832 --> 01:53:10.765
answer, because I wanted to know
know, the first question is, I 

01:53:10.766 --> 01:53:13.172
wanted to know the status of the

01:53:13.173 --> 01:53:18.123
National Endowment of the Arts, 
because when 45 was elected, I 

01:53:18.124 --> 01:53:22.404
think he announced he was going 
to get rid of the National 

01:53:22.405 --> 01:53:25.489
Endowment of the Arts.  I was 
signing petitions to keep it, 

01:53:25.686 --> 01:53:29.519
National Endowment of Humanities
Humanities, public broadcasting 

01:53:29.520 --> 01:53:32.356
corporation, if any of you can 
answer that question.  The 

01:53:32.357 --> 01:53:33.672
second question I guess would be

01:53:33.673 --> 01:53:40.316
directed to Mr. Alexander.  It 
was a beautiful presentation you

01:53:41.932 --> 01:53:46.378
the brain and I wanted to know 
if you've done any studies on 

01:53:46.379 --> 01:53:50.202
the effect of music and the arts
arts, but particularly music, on

01:53:52.830 --> 01:53:56.463
necessarily Asperger's but kind 
of in the medium of the spectrum

01:53:56.466 --> 01:53:58.776
spectrum.
&gt;&gt;  Great.  I know we can 

01:53:58.777 --> 01:54:01.924
address question two.  So we're 
going to focus on that one and 

01:54:01.925 --> 01:54:06.168
maybe there can be a sidebar 
with the panel about the first 

01:54:06.169 --> 01:54:08.869
one.  Alex, you want to take 
that?

01:54:08.894 --> 01:54:12.001
&gt;&gt;  Absolutely.  So there are 
already a number of studies that

01:54:22.376 --> 01:54:23.889
And the timeing of your question

01:54:23.890 --> 01:54:28.221
for me is very apt.  I'm 
exploring a research study at 

01:54:28.222 --> 01:54:32.857
Johns Hopkins, my institution, 
as we speak, with the Kennedy Kr

01:54:33.173 --> 01:54:37.109
Kreiger Institute and oother 
partners.  We have an interested

01:54:39.218 --> 01:54:44.568
exploring that now.  Until now, 
my work as a movement disorders 

01:54:44.569 --> 01:54:47.094
neurologist has focused on the 
other end of the spectrum, aging

01:54:47.188 --> 01:54:53.838
aging.  So I have done a study 
called Parkinsonics using group 

01:54:53.839 --> 01:54:57.079
choir singing to improve 
communication, get the voice 

01:54:57.080 --> 01:55:01.604
louder and clearer in patients 
with Parkinson's, so we're 

01:55:01.605 --> 01:55:04.441
submitting that for publication 
in a few weeks.  To give a 

01:55:04.442 --> 01:55:08.373
broader context, I've been very 
fortunate to help establish and 

01:55:08.374 --> 01:55:10.088
lead at Johns Hopkins our Center

01:55:10.089 --> 01:55:12.405
for Music and Medicine, where we

01:55:12.406 --> 01:55:14.417
seek to make music and rhythm an

01:55:14.418 --> 01:55:16.560
integral part of healing illness

01:55:16.561 --> 01:55:20.577
across the age spectrum.
&gt;&gt;  Great.  And, you know, it's 

01:55:20.578 --> 01:55:24.109
interesting, performing arts 
organizations definitely across 

01:55:24.110 --> 01:55:27.544
the district and across the 
country really are thinking 

01:55:27.545 --> 01:55:29.555
about how to create more relaxed

01:55:29.556 --> 01:55:32.784
settings, whether it's an 
autistic child or other barrier 

01:55:32.785 --> 01:55:36.307
to really participating as an 
audience member but there are 

01:55:36.308 --> 01:55:42.546
relaxed performances to welcome 
folks in.  Unfortunately we are 

01:55:42.547 --> 01:55:43.470
right about time and we're going

01:55:43.471 --> 01:55:48.813
to end with a performance.  I 
wonder if you'll indulge me.  

01:55:48.814 --> 01:55:51.234
I'm furiously taking notes 
because I look for themes from 

01:55:51.235 --> 01:55:55.079
the conversations, so I end up 
with five bold words, but I have

01:55:56.317 --> 01:55:59.313
Though I tried to get them down 
to 10.  This is what I would 

01:55:59.314 --> 01:56:00.620
like to leave you with before we

01:56:00.621 --> 01:56:07.275
leave with another song.
So this cross-town bond I love. 

01:56:10.611 --> 01:56:13.636
think voice was just across this

01:56:13.637 --> 01:56:17.768
whole panel.  Evidence, 
ancestors, language, tools, 

01:56:17.769 --> 01:56:21.091
literacy, produceers of culture,

01:56:21.092 --> 01:56:26.952
trust, and then I love -- I 
think this is Asha "finding a 

01:56:26.953 --> 01:56:30.980
home in the library"," which I 
think we did today, right?

01:56:31.005 --> 01:56:34.703
So can we do a beautiful round 
of applause for this wonderful 

01:56:34.704 --> 01:56:37.730
panel, please.
[Applause]

01:56:41.567 --> 01:56:45.077
&gt;&gt;  And we would like to give a 
thunderous round of applause for

01:56:46.902 --> 01:56:48.648
more piece for us.  Thanks again
again.

01:56:48.649 --> 01:56:50.872
[Applause]

01:57:15.080 --> 01:57:17.199
&gt;&gt;  Hey again.  I'm back.
&gt;&gt;  All right! 

01:57:17.227 --> 01:57:22.935
&gt;&gt;  Yep.
Okay.  So I will play one more 

01:57:22.936 --> 01:57:25.633
piece for you.  It's one of my 
compositions, actually.

01:57:28.894 --> 01:57:36.745
  So this 
one is called "Headlights"."  I 

01:57:36.746 --> 01:57:39.472
hope you enjoy.

02:00:38.678 --> 02:00:40.808
[Applause]

02:00:50.859 --> 02:00:54.502
&gt;&gt;  Thank you! 
&gt;&gt;  Thank you, Jose! 

02:00:54.528 --> 02:01:01.333
&gt;&gt;  Sorry.  Before I say "bye" 
to everybody, before I'm leaving

02:01:01.548 --> 02:01:06.203
leaving, I will give a quick 
message to everybody that is 

02:01:06.204 --> 02:01:08.204
here.

02:01:09.393 --> 02:01:13.229
  This is a really 
important message.  And it's 

02:01:13.230 --> 02:01:15.757
going to help you and it's going

02:01:15.758 --> 02:01:20.490
to change your life.  So here it

02:01:20.491 --> 02:01:27.123
is...
Be brave.  Always.  When you are

02:01:29.388 --> 02:01:31.670
you.  And you're not going to do

02:01:31.671 --> 02:01:38.924
a lot of things in your life.  
You always have to practice, re

02:01:39.124 --> 02:01:46.980
rehearse, be good with the 
people, and be brave.  The brave

02:01:48.292 --> 02:01:52.425
important for you because it's 
going to help you to get a lot 

02:01:52.426 --> 02:01:55.558
of things and it's going to help

02:01:55.559 --> 02:02:00.598
you in your life, because maybe 
you're going to have some 

02:02:00.599 --> 02:02:08.449
challenges.  And that important 
things is going to help you to 

02:02:08.450 --> 02:02:12.777
get that challenge out of your 
life.  So stay with this phrase

02:02:12.985 --> 02:02:19.828
phrase...
"Be good.  Be brave.  And re

02:02:19.829 --> 02:02:24.467
rehearse a lot"."
God bless you.  And thank you 

02:02:24.468 --> 02:02:27.702
very much, everyone! 
&gt;&gt;  Thank you! 

02:02:27.729 --> 02:02:29.938
[Applause]

02:02:36.051 --> 02:02:41.705
&gt;&gt;  So we're going to -- thank 
you again, Jose! Marvelous! 

02:02:41.730 --> 02:02:45.840
We're going to take about a 30-
30-minute pause, but I don't 

02:02:45.841 --> 02:02:48.172
want to call it a "break" break,

02:02:48.173 --> 02:02:51.202
because when Sue was speaking 
earlier and enticeing you a bit 

02:02:51.203 --> 02:02:55.525
about all of the treasures and 
magical things that are in the 

02:02:55.526 --> 02:02:58.671
collections of the Library of 
Congress, we have a few of them 

02:02:58.672 --> 02:03:02.091
next door.
So in the room right next door, 

02:03:02.092 --> 02:03:05.331
colleagues of ours from the 
American Folk Life Center, which

02:03:06.239 --> 02:03:10.682
Congress, as well as our Music 
Division, as well as our Prints 

02:03:10.683 --> 02:03:15.020
and Photographs Division, they 
brought some examples of the 

02:03:15.021 --> 02:03:16.827
library's artistic collections. 

02:03:16.828 --> 02:03:19.253
And I really, really hope you'll

02:03:19.254 --> 02:03:22.981
take some time to stop by next 
door and take a look.  The rest 

02:03:22.982 --> 02:03:26.607
rooms are right around the 
corner near where you came in, 

02:03:26.608 --> 02:03:29.030
and please be back in your seats

02:03:29.031 --> 02:03:31.859
right at 11:30 so we can get the

02:03:31.860 --> 02:03:41.324
second panel started.  Thanks.

02:20:50.721 --> 02:20:51.765
...
...

02:20:51.766 --> 02:20:53.766
...

02:21:19.022 --> 02:21:21.281
Test
Test

02:31:48.935 --> 02:31:52.237
&gt;&gt;  If everybody could start
moving toward their seats, we're

02:31:52.238 --> 02:31:55.178
going to get started in three or
four minutes.  Thanks.

02:37:40.140 --> 02:37:46.186
&gt;&gt;  Hello.  Can everyone take
their seats so we can start with

02:37:46.187 --> 02:37:48.187
panel 2.

02:38:00.577 --> 02:38:04.529
Now we're just about ready to
start with panel 2.  But before

02:38:04.530 --> 02:38:06.530
we begin, I just wanted

02:38:09.153 --> 02:38:13.394
 to
acknowledge the Arts Commission.

02:38:15.135 --> 02:38:19.041
Thank you.
It was through Ann that the arts

02:38:19.042 --> 02:38:26.403
education policy that we started
ten years ago came to fruition. 

02:38:26.404 --> 02:38:33.979
So thank you.
And now without further ado we

02:38:33.980 --> 02:38:41.231
will start panel 2.
Okay.  Hello again! 

02:38:41.254 --> 02:38:45.576
I hoped that after coffee and
stretch time folks come back. 

02:38:45.577 --> 02:38:50.216
Thank you core coming back.  I'm
LeeAnn Potter, I direct

02:38:50.519 --> 02:38:53.438
educational outreach here at the
Library of Congress and a couple

02:38:53.439 --> 02:38:59.499
of months ago when Rhona and I
started brainstorming, what this

02:38:59.500 --> 02:39:03.341
symposium would do, we agreed
that it should answer

02:39:03.735 --> 02:39:07.667
essentially four questions. 
Maybe three questions.  I'll get

02:39:07.668 --> 02:39:11.717
to the fourth.  We thought about
why.  We thought about how.  We

02:39:11.718 --> 02:39:14.730
thought about what.  We thought
about all the good questions. 

02:39:14.731 --> 02:39:19.878
And as far as the "why" goes,
what we were thinking about was

02:39:19.879 --> 02:39:23.125
why arts education matters, and
I think the first panel

02:39:23.621 --> 02:39:27.748
certainly did an excellent job
addressing the "why."  Our hope

02:39:27.749 --> 02:39:32.197
with regard to the "what" was
that some of you would be

02:39:32.498 --> 02:39:34.814
thinking, what does the Library
of Congress have to do with arts

02:39:34.815 --> 02:39:37.744
education?  It's not immediately
the first place we think of when

02:39:37.745 --> 02:39:41.687
we think of the arts.  So our
hope was when you had a chance

02:39:41.688 --> 02:39:47.536
to see some of the items from
the library's collection and

02:39:47.739 --> 02:39:51.467
hear what else is in the Lynn's
collection, that the "what does

02:39:51.468 --> 02:39:55.319
the library have to do with arts
education" would become more

02:39:55.373 --> 02:39:58.531
clear.  I hope that happened. 
Did anybody happen to see

02:39:58.735 --> 02:40:00.185
something you weren't expecting
to see?

02:40:00.186 --> 02:40:03.078
Good.  That was kind of the
hope, that you would see things

02:40:03.079 --> 02:40:06.316
you hadn't expected would be
here.

02:40:06.339 --> 02:40:10.860
The next question is really the
question that our second panel

02:40:10.861 --> 02:40:16.107
is going to focus on this
morning, and that question is

02:40:16.108 --> 02:40:20.952
the "how."  So how do these
amazing resources that live in

02:40:20.953 --> 02:40:25.591
the collections of the Library
of Congress, how can they be

02:40:26.203 --> 02:40:28.926
incorporated into arts education
in ways that are truly

02:40:29.328 --> 02:40:34.182
meaningful and truly inspiring?
And so we have a marvelous

02:40:34.379 --> 02:40:39.120
panel, and I'm going to start by
introducing you to a colleague

02:40:39.121 --> 02:40:44.169
of mine, Ray white is a senior
music specialist in the

02:40:44.465 --> 02:40:47.103
library's music division, and he
is actually -- when I say this

02:40:47.104 --> 02:40:50.327
is a panel, I got to be honest
with you, it's really not so

02:40:50.641 --> 02:40:54.766
much a panel as it is a
performance, a panel, and a

02:40:54.774 --> 02:40:59.908
performance.  So our first
performer is my colleague Ray

02:41:00.519 --> 02:41:03.751
White and Ray is going to do a
performance for you that I hope

02:41:03.752 --> 02:41:09.184
will get you thinking much the
way a classroom teacher is often

02:41:09.185 --> 02:41:13.535
thinking about how do we get
young people to understand that

02:41:13.536 --> 02:41:16.973
creativity doesn't just happen,
that it really is a process and

02:41:16.974 --> 02:41:20.668
that rough drafts really do play
an important role in creativity.

02:41:25.550 --> 02:41:27.550
turn.
[Applause]

02:41:31.773 --> 02:41:35.204
&gt;&gt;  Thank you very much.  What
I'm going to offer up in the

02:41:36.015 --> 02:41:40.860
next few minutes are materials
that are housed in the library's

02:41:40.861 --> 02:41:46.014
music division.  They're among
our great treasures, and they do

02:41:46.015 --> 02:41:50.748
demonstrate the creative process
at work.  Now, perhaps many of

02:41:50.749 --> 02:41:57.229
you may be familiar with the
song "My Favorite Things" from

02:41:57.230 --> 02:42:01.439
the sound of music, and perhaps
the sound that runs in your

02:42:01.733 --> 02:42:05.781
brain when you hear that is
Julie Andrews singing it.  But

02:42:05.782 --> 02:42:13.939
suppose she's saying this, which
Oscar Hammerstein wrote before

02:42:13.940 --> 02:42:15.940
what he wrote what you probably
remember.

02:42:29.124 --> 02:42:31.614
 raindrops and roses and
whiskers on kitten  

02:42:43.269 --> 02:42:45.642
  these are a few of the
favorite things that I like  

02:42:46.596 --> 02:42:51.223
[ Laughter ]
Oscar Hammerstein was on his way

02:42:51.224 --> 02:42:53.958
where he was going, but he was
not there yet.

02:42:53.990 --> 02:42:56.485
[ Laughter ]
Also, from

02:42:59.523 --> 02:43:05.967
 the same show there's
the famous song called doe

02:43:06.266 --> 02:43:09.407
re mi, and Oscar started out
with the idea he was going to

02:43:09.408 --> 02:43:11.408
find some word to make

02:43:13.552 --> 02:43:15.552
 each of
those syllables into a phrase.

02:43:24.424 --> 02:43:27.664
arrived.

02:43:27.697 --> 02:43:35.751
  do is a very young female deer
  ray is a light from the sun  

02:43:39.543 --> 02:43:46.151
mi is a thing I call myself  
  far is a very long way to run

02:44:00.344 --> 02:44:08.336
  tea you drink when taking eat
  now we come right back to do  

02:44:09.081 --> 02:44:18.058
You have to figure out that when
you get "sow"... sowing wheat, I

02:44:18.059 --> 02:44:19.802
don't know who would have
thought of that.

02:44:19.803 --> 02:44:21.803
Now we shift

02:44:24.774 --> 02:44:28.327
 gears to
irvinBerlin, whose materials

02:44:28.531 --> 02:44:34.676
also reside at the library, and
one of the things that his

02:44:35.182 --> 02:44:38.720
materials for God bless America
demonstrate that depending on

02:44:38.721 --> 02:44:45.471
the time and circumstances of
someone's creativity, their

02:44:45.769 --> 02:44:48.609
creativity product may vary. 
The short story about God bless

02:44:48.610 --> 02:44:52.537
America is it was originally
written during the closing

02:44:52.943 --> 02:44:54.943
months of World War I.

02:44:57.262 --> 02:45:00.801
  It was
an all soldier's review called

02:45:05.126 --> 02:45:09.768
yipyap, at long island.  He
wrote this thing called "God

02:45:10.269 --> 02:45:14.923
Bless America."
He also decided it was too

02:45:16.122 --> 02:45:19.957
anthem-like to be the end of
this vaudeville show, so she put

02:45:19.958 --> 02:45:24.905
it aside and came back in 1938
and revised it when

02:45:25.111 --> 02:45:27.111
circumstances had changed.

02:45:30.139 --> 02:45:32.139
But this is what he first wrote.

02:45:47.069 --> 02:45:51.813
 God bless America  
Land that I love

02:45:51.845 --> 02:45:57.848
Stand beside her
And guide her

02:46:00.862 --> 02:46:05.500
   to the right
with the light from above

02:46:10.537 --> 02:46:16.590
and right as political
orientations were not in common

02:46:16.591 --> 02:46:23.358
parlance, and all he meant was
"guide her to the right path"

02:46:23.359 --> 02:46:26.815
which is fine, but guide her to
the right with the light from

02:46:26.816 --> 02:46:31.934
above... and then he decided 20
years later, fixing it up, it

02:46:31.935 --> 02:46:34.264
became guide her through the
night with the light from above,

02:46:34.265 --> 02:46:38.298
which is just plainly better
poetry.

02:46:38.333 --> 02:46:42.344
So there went that change.  But
the song keeps on going.  And it

02:46:42.345 --> 02:46:44.345
continues like this...

02:46:46.786 --> 02:46:48.786
"Make her

02:46:51.612 --> 02:46:53.612
 victorious"

02:46:55.753 --> 02:46:58.465
"On land and form"
Now, the part you are running in

02:46:58.466 --> 02:47:01.596
your head was probably the
mountains and the prairies an

02:47:01.597 --> 02:47:04.845
the oceans white with foam. 
Well, that didn't exist in the

02:47:04.846 --> 02:47:09.177
early one.  "Make her
victorious" because the United

02:47:09.178 --> 02:47:11.501
States was in a war at the

02:47:14.517 --> 02:47:16.517
 time,

02:47:17.530 --> 02:47:22.784
but "on land and foam"...
Foam has to rhyme with home, I

02:47:22.785 --> 02:47:28.735
get that part, but then he -- in
1938 he went back in the

02:47:29.144 --> 02:47:32.482
mountains and prairies and the
oceans white with foam... okay,

02:47:32.483 --> 02:47:34.483
that's an acceptable line.

02:47:37.110 --> 02:47:39.045
  But
we got the foam and the home,

02:47:39.046 --> 02:47:45.615
and then he finishes up with
this end, which I find a little

02:47:45.616 --> 02:47:47.811
bit musically awkward, dare I
say it.

02:47:47.844 --> 02:47:52.266
Ready?
"God bless America...

02:47:55.781 --> 02:48:05.250
My home sweet home ""
Now, I say again, I don't think

02:48:05.251 --> 02:48:10.251
there's anything at all wrong
with writing something that is

02:48:10.252 --> 02:48:15.347
clumsy or awkward or inelegant
or whatever you want to say in

02:48:15.348 --> 02:48:21.686
the creative process as long as
the creative process continues

02:48:21.687 --> 02:48:25.828
along.  And it gets to where
it's -- it ultimately is going

02:48:25.829 --> 02:48:32.073
to go, which points out to me
that music writing is part art

02:48:32.074 --> 02:48:34.074
and part craft.

02:48:35.816 --> 02:48:39.930
  And our last
example is also from Irving

02:48:41.045 --> 02:48:46.113
Berlin, his 1946 show "Annie Get
Your Gun."  If you have seen

02:48:46.313 --> 02:48:49.737
that show or know about it, you
know it's about Annie Oakley,

02:48:49.738 --> 02:48:55.283
the 19th century sharp shooter
and her friends Buffalo Bill and

02:48:55.284 --> 02:48:59.626
Charlie and Frank butler and
they want her to join the

02:48:59.743 --> 02:49:04.280
western show.  They sing a song
"no business like show business"

02:49:04.281 --> 02:49:07.301
telling her how great show
business is.  So as the song

02:49:07.501 --> 02:49:10.543
goes on and the verses progress,
then she kind of joins in with

02:49:10.544 --> 02:49:16.999
him, and when they get to the
reprieve, she sings it herself,

02:49:17.000 --> 02:49:19.924
no business like show business,
let's go on with the show.

02:49:19.958 --> 02:49:24.028
Well, there were a lot of words
that Irving Berlin wrote for

02:49:24.158 --> 02:49:27.899
this song that didn't make it to
the final stage either, and bear

02:49:27.900 --> 02:49:31.830
in mind that the ones that we're
going to share with you now are

02:49:31.831 --> 02:49:34.969
in that category.  Before we do,
though, I would like to

02:49:35.485 --> 02:49:39.409
introduce my colleague, Steven
Usco, who joined at the piano

02:49:39.410 --> 02:49:41.358
for this performance.  Thank
you, Steve! 

02:49:41.359 --> 02:49:43.359
[Applause]

02:49:44.643 --> 02:49:52.821
Imagine if you will these three
guys and then ethyl

02:49:55.255 --> 02:49:57.255
 Meman,
there's no business like show.

02:49:57.558 --> 02:50:01.206
"There's no business like show
business

02:50:01.239 --> 02:50:07.649
Like no business I know
Management complaining of the

02:50:07.650 --> 02:50:14.006
grosses
Giving you that cake routine

02:50:14.039 --> 02:50:19.753
And the leading man that gives
you doses of Halleytosis at

02:50:20.755 --> 02:50:24.891
every scene
There's no people like show

02:50:25.192 --> 02:50:28.418
people
They smile when they are low

02:50:28.451 --> 02:50:33.063
Shows are so expensive
There's an awful nut

02:50:33.096 --> 02:50:37.191
Instead of closing you take a
cut

02:50:37.224 --> 02:50:40.827
Everyone gets paid except the
actors but...

02:50:40.859 --> 02:50:47.986
Let's go on with the show!
There's no business like show

02:50:47.987 --> 02:50:50.514
business
Like no business

02:50:50.548 --> 02:50:55.739
I know

02:51:00.892 --> 02:51:02.910
grouch
And the stage director

02:51:04.424 --> 02:51:06.637
everlasting
Who does his casting

02:51:06.670 --> 02:51:12.999
Upon a couch
There's no people like show

02:51:13.406 --> 02:51:16.926
people
They smile when they are low

02:51:16.958 --> 02:51:20.978
Living with your husband in a
cheap hotel

02:51:21.010 --> 02:51:25.298
The stork is coming
You feel like hell

02:51:25.331 --> 02:51:28.827
Doctors in the dressing room
But still they yell...

02:51:28.859 --> 02:51:33.781
Let's go on with the show!

02:51:33.969 --> 02:51:35.969
[Applause]

02:51:40.326 --> 02:51:43.560
&gt;&gt;  Thank you very much.
&gt;&gt;  Oh, that was marvelous. 

02:51:43.660 --> 02:51:48.410
Thank you, Ray. terrific! 
So our next two panelists, and

02:51:48.411 --> 02:51:53.156
I'm going to go kind of this
way... our next two panelists

02:51:53.157 --> 02:51:56.191
represent organizations that are
part of the teaching with

02:51:56.887 --> 02:52:00.237
primary sources consortium.  For
more than ten years the Library

02:52:00.238 --> 02:52:04.468
of Congress has been receiving
appropriations from Congress

02:52:04.559 --> 02:52:09.093
that have been directed to the
library for us to redistribute

02:52:09.094 --> 02:52:13.233
as grants to organizations to
develop curriculum and to make

02:52:13.234 --> 02:52:15.162
available professional
development opportunities for

02:52:15.163 --> 02:52:19.488
teachers.  Today we have 29
different organizations all

02:52:19.692 --> 02:52:22.203
around the United States who are
receiving grant funding from the

02:52:22.204 --> 02:52:25.841
library for all kinds of
programs.  Not all of them are

02:52:25.842 --> 02:52:29.171
specifically connect to arts
education but two of the

02:52:29.467 --> 02:52:34.113
programs that are represented
here today are.  Erin Elman is

02:52:34.114 --> 02:52:38.156
going to be our first speaker
and Erin is currently the dean

02:52:38.157 --> 02:52:42.184
of continuing studies at the
University of the arts in

02:52:42.375 --> 02:52:44.907
Philadelphia and I'm going to
letter intake it from here.

02:52:45.234 --> 02:52:48.253
&gt;&gt;  Okay.  I'm going to do a
little bit of a PowerPoint.  How

02:52:48.254 --> 02:52:56.606
do I move this?  Just...
Okay.  Hello, everyone! I want

02:52:56.607 --> 02:53:00.265
to just say how inspired I have
been and, Ray, that was a really

02:53:00.266 --> 02:53:05.409
tough act to follow.  I don't
sing.  I'm a visual artist.  But

02:53:05.410 --> 02:53:10.459
I'll start out by saying that I
am really honored to be here and

02:53:10.460 --> 02:53:13.686
I'm going to -- I've been so
inspired by the first panel I'm

02:53:13.687 --> 02:53:16.817
going to shift things up a
little bit in my presentation. 

02:53:16.818 --> 02:53:20.045
I may not get through all the
slides but I think you'll enjoy

02:53:20.046 --> 02:53:22.889
it more.
So just to give you a context of

02:53:22.890 --> 02:53:26.322
who we are at the University of
the Arts, we're in Philadelphia,

02:53:26.323 --> 02:53:30.444
Pennsylvania.  We are a small
private art institution that

02:53:30.749 --> 02:53:35.293
houses all of the arts, visual,
performing and creative writing.

02:53:37.223 --> 02:53:40.155
nation to devote ourselves
exclusively to the arts.  There

02:53:40.156 --> 02:53:43.061
are 1800 students that are
studying graduate and

02:53:43.812 --> 02:53:46.420
undergraduate programs.  And I
represent the dean of continuing

02:53:46.421 --> 02:53:51.969
studies, so what is that? 
That's another 2900 students

02:53:52.380 --> 02:53:55.813
that are the learning continuum
from very young people that do

02:53:55.814 --> 02:54:00.535
out of school programs on
Saturdays and credit their

02:54:00.736 --> 02:54:03.764
programs in the summer for high
school students.  We have

02:54:04.469 --> 02:54:09.405
enrichment programs for adults. 
But we also have about 1,000 in

02:54:09.406 --> 02:54:13.859
service K12 teachers that come
to us to study programs, the

02:54:14.550 --> 02:54:19.741
summer music studies programs. 
Johanna actually teaches in and

02:54:19.742 --> 02:54:22.315
is part of that program.  We
have a professional institute

02:54:22.316 --> 02:54:27.671
for educators, and in the music
program and the professional

02:54:27.863 --> 02:54:33.222
institute programs we have
non-matric and matric courses

02:54:33.223 --> 02:54:36.048
for educators.  So in that
program is the teaching with

02:54:36.544 --> 02:54:39.079
primary sources program, and
just to give you a little bit of

02:54:39.080 --> 02:54:45.536
a history, back in 2010 we saw
an RFP for an organization to

02:54:45.537 --> 02:54:48.951
deliver opportunities to develop
curriculum and professional

02:54:49.155 --> 02:54:52.187
development experiences for K12
teachers, and one of my

02:54:53.031 --> 02:54:55.826
colleagues saw it and said, Ann,
we have to apply for that, we're

02:54:55.827 --> 02:54:58.973
just perfect.  I said, yes, but
we're really at capacity, how

02:54:58.974 --> 02:55:02.894
much more can we do?  We have
2500 students.  She said, how

02:55:02.895 --> 02:55:06.723
could we not?  I said, how could
we not?  We were thrilled we

02:55:06.941 --> 02:55:09.563
were selected to be part of a
consortium.  And what was really

02:55:09.564 --> 02:55:14.203
exciting to learn was that the
other consortia members across

02:55:14.204 --> 02:55:16.830
the United States working on a
lot of different disciplines, a

02:55:16.831 --> 02:55:20.451
lot of them history, actually
they themselves had requested an

02:55:20.452 --> 02:55:23.792
arts-based partner, because
nobody in the consortium was

02:55:24.094 --> 02:55:26.638
doing work in the arts and they
thought that was really

02:55:26.647 --> 02:55:31.154
important.  So I just -- this is
where I start talking about what

02:55:31.155 --> 02:55:34.097
we heard before.  So when
Christopher said, you know, to

02:55:34.098 --> 02:55:38.032
think about the future, a lot of
cultures think about the past. 

02:55:38.033 --> 02:55:43.283
We actually adopted as our logo
"look back, see further" for a

02:55:43.284 --> 02:55:46.423
work with teaching with primary
sources.  That was sort of what

02:55:46.424 --> 02:55:49.846
emerged.  When we tried to think
about, how do we encapsulate the

02:55:49.847 --> 02:55:53.982
work that we're doing.  So
really we set about creating a

02:55:53.983 --> 02:55:59.637
comprehensive program where we
can help educators, K12 service

02:55:59.638 --> 02:56:03.066
teachers and librarians really
figure out how they can bring

02:56:03.067 --> 02:56:06.798
the arts into their teaching. 
And for us it was a little bit

02:56:06.799 --> 02:56:09.839
of a journey as well.  Where we
stand right now, where we

02:56:10.338 --> 02:56:12.565
developed -- I'll give an
overview and we'll break it down

02:56:12.566 --> 02:56:14.590
a little bit.  We offer courses.

02:56:15.395 --> 02:56:19.521
They're available for free for
non-credit and we offer graduate

02:56:19.522 --> 02:56:23.045
credits and matriculated
students can take these

02:56:23.053 --> 02:56:27.109
programs.  We have an overview
course and discipline specific

02:56:27.110 --> 02:56:32.050
courses.  We also create some
curriculum guides that come out

02:56:32.051 --> 02:56:33.964
of our professional development.

02:56:33.965 --> 02:56:36.894
We test them and we develop them
through professional development

02:56:36.895 --> 02:56:40.765
and we're going to have examples
of those on tables when you

02:56:40.823 --> 02:56:43.658
leave, if you want to grab one,
you're welcome to it.  We also

02:56:43.659 --> 02:56:47.005
try to provide everything -- as
much as what we do online for

02:56:47.006 --> 02:56:50.630
free, so a national audience. 
And so we have two vehicles for

02:56:50.631 --> 02:56:53.768
a web presence, which I'll talk
about later, and then we have a

02:56:53.769 --> 02:56:56.292
coaching program, which I want
to mention now, because I'm

02:56:56.393 --> 02:56:58.621
going to mention the coaches
throughout the program.  So one

02:56:58.622 --> 02:57:02.359
of the things -- and it's
really -- in thinking really --

02:57:02.360 --> 02:57:05.280
to be thoughtful about how the
programs live and build and

02:57:05.694 --> 02:57:08.815
grow, the consortium and the
Library of Congress decided that

02:57:08.816 --> 02:57:13.158
it was really important to
develop high level edge caters

02:57:13.159 --> 02:57:16.592
that are really embedded in
these materials so they can

02:57:16.801 --> 02:57:19.724
bring them back to schools and
school districts and the

02:57:19.922 --> 02:57:22.447
language we develop around them
as coaches.  So we have people

02:57:22.448 --> 02:57:26.495
who take numerous courses that
we then put them through their

02:57:26.496 --> 02:57:28.496
own professional

02:57:29.978 --> 02:57:31.731
 development
experience so they can become

02:57:31.732 --> 02:57:34.981
leaders in the field.  Here is
where I'm going back to previous

02:57:34.982 --> 02:57:40.109
panel.  So thank you panel 1 for
some beautifully illustrating

02:57:40.110 --> 02:57:43.251
that.  I'm taking notes during
the first panel.  Of course,

02:57:43.862 --> 02:57:48.483
Susan and Dr. Chu really talked
about how important the arts are

02:57:48.484 --> 02:57:53.932
and actually noted some key
studies but also, you know, the

02:57:53.933 --> 02:57:57.374
arts as a superpower, I love
that, I'm going to use that, and

02:57:57.375 --> 02:58:01.218
they have their own language. 
And then, you know, Asha talked

02:58:01.219 --> 02:58:04.238
about how as a young person the
arts was how she connected

02:58:04.369 --> 02:58:08.391
through school.  And we also --
I mean, thank you so much,

02:58:08.894 --> 02:58:11.206
Nathan, for the six themes. 
Because I think the themes are

02:58:11.207 --> 02:58:14.052
embedded in the work that we do,
and it was the way you

02:58:15.347 --> 02:58:17.670
articulated them really help us
focus a little more on the

02:58:17.783 --> 02:58:22.223
future.  And, of course, those
performances show us how we can

02:58:22.224 --> 02:58:26.249
be transformed and moved through
the arts and we're all having

02:58:26.250 --> 02:58:29.188
our own personal experience.  So
that's what we're trying to do. 

02:58:29.189 --> 02:58:32.313
We're trying to say to teachers
across disciplines, it's

02:58:32.511 --> 02:58:35.843
important to note that I think
maybe some people, when we --

02:58:35.844 --> 02:58:39.373
when I talk about this, people
think, only art teachers take

02:58:39.374 --> 02:58:42.315
your courses.  Actually, no, we
have lots of elementary school

02:58:42.316 --> 02:58:45.439
teachers and we get gym teachers
that take our program, and

02:58:46.137 --> 02:58:48.358
librarians and
discipline-specific teachers.  I

02:58:48.359 --> 02:58:51.498
think about 40% of our
participants in our program are

02:58:51.499 --> 02:58:54.739
arts teachers, but what is
really important is that they

02:58:54.740 --> 02:58:58.466
get to hear the perspective of
the other teachers about how

02:58:59.081 --> 02:59:01.907
disconnected and siloed the arts
can feel, and they get an

02:59:02.097 --> 02:59:04.720
opportunity to understand how
they can bring history or

02:59:05.034 --> 02:59:08.988
science or math into their
classrooms, and so we -- and the

02:59:08.989 --> 02:59:12.285
other thing we learned as we've
grown in our program is in the

02:59:12.286 --> 02:59:16.037
beginning we started to think
about primary sources in the

02:59:16.529 --> 02:59:19.858
arts as the products, but what
we actually -- actually what Ray

02:59:19.859 --> 02:59:23.501
illustrated is it's actually the
stuff behind the scenes that can

02:59:23.502 --> 02:59:27.923
teach us a lot more about the
arts.  So we can look at, you

02:59:27.924 --> 02:59:32.068
know, choreographic notes, the
library has a beautiful

02:59:32.673 --> 02:59:36.596
collection of, or musical
notation or notes from a drama

02:59:36.597 --> 02:59:39.628
or sketchbooks or notes of an
artist.  So those are all the

02:59:39.629 --> 02:59:41.750
reasons why we think it's
important.

02:59:41.866 --> 02:59:45.076
So the way we developed our
program is we have two different

02:59:45.077 --> 02:59:47.923
types of courses, and I listed
these here.  I'm not going to go

02:59:47.924 --> 02:59:50.441
through them.  I'm hoping that
the PowerPoint will be made

02:59:50.638 --> 02:59:54.684
available later so people can go
back to it, but we have overview

02:59:54.685 --> 02:59:57.810
courses and discipline-specific
courses.  And the overview

02:59:58.215 --> 03:00:01.861
courses generally are about 40
to 45 participants and they're

03:00:01.862 --> 03:00:04.785
very field trip and lecture
based.  We don't do that much

03:00:04.786 --> 03:00:08.019
hands-on, a little bit.  And
discipline-specific course is

03:00:08.020 --> 03:00:11.562
through more of a focused study
in the discipline.  I'm going to

03:00:11.563 --> 03:00:13.588
talk first about the overview
courses.

03:00:13.613 --> 03:00:17.315
So in those courses -- all of
the courses run five days,

03:00:17.512 --> 03:00:20.742
Monday through Friday, 8:30 in
the morning to about 6:00 at

03:00:20.749 --> 03:00:25.280
night.  They're super-packed and
energizing.  We get teachers

03:00:25.483 --> 03:00:28.309
from across the country, people
from San Francisco, people --

03:00:28.310 --> 03:00:30.847
because they're free, sometimes
teachers use it as an

03:00:30.942 --> 03:00:32.765
opportunity to get to
Philadelphia and we can help

03:00:32.766 --> 03:00:35.982
them find, you know, low cost
accommodations.  But we spend

03:00:35.983 --> 03:00:39.923
the first day really introducing
primary sources and copyright

03:00:39.924 --> 03:00:43.156
and why is it important to
choose primary sources.  I think

03:00:43.157 --> 03:00:46.091
what we were surprised to learn
is how many people that take our

03:00:46.092 --> 03:00:49.920
classes don't actually know
about the digitized collections

03:00:49.921 --> 03:00:54.179
of the Library of Congress in
subject matter, let alone the

03:00:54.180 --> 03:00:58.000
arts.  So that's really sort of
an opportunity for them though

03:00:58.001 --> 03:01:01.027
get comfortable with their
searches and understand a little

03:01:01.028 --> 03:01:05.357
about the framework.  Then we
also talk about this wonderful

03:01:05.358 --> 03:01:09.794
tool which is in the guides that
we're handing out and online on

03:01:09.795 --> 03:01:15.043
our websites, and it's sort of
this -- a framework for observed

03:01:15.044 --> 03:01:17.374
question and reflect and it
walks you through it.  There's

03:01:17.375 --> 03:01:21.110
one specifically for frames and
photograph, but there's more

03:01:21.220 --> 03:01:25.765
general ones and we use that, we
use it as exemplars, and we have

03:01:25.766 --> 03:01:29.688
always have great lectures that
come in and talk about arts and

03:01:29.689 --> 03:01:32.752
primary sources and make those
connections.  We're in

03:01:33.420 --> 03:01:38.373
Philadelphia, so there is no
lack of amazing collections and

03:01:38.374 --> 03:01:42.409
we utilize as many of them as
possible.  Then we ask our

03:01:43.107 --> 03:01:45.330
teachers to share out and they
post, so there's an opportunity

03:01:45.331 --> 03:01:48.781
for them to do their own
reflection, and then they create

03:01:48.782 --> 03:01:52.401
primary source sets through one
of the Library of Congress

03:01:52.598 --> 03:01:55.530
tools, which I'll talk about
later, which they can utilize

03:01:55.531 --> 03:01:59.283
later.  So very briefly, this is
a course we developed last

03:01:59.379 --> 03:02:04.323
summer.  So how many of you have
heard of Steam?  Yeah, I got the

03:02:04.324 --> 03:02:11.588
right audience.  So I have...
We decided to say, well, what

03:02:11.589 --> 03:02:18.448
kind of Steam objects,
collateral, art projects are

03:02:18.542 --> 03:02:21.675
available to the Library of
Congress that can be tied into

03:02:21.676 --> 03:02:24.910
all different disciplines?  And
so we were so lucky.  How many

03:02:24.911 --> 03:02:27.735
of you know that the Library of
Congress actually has teachers

03:02:27.736 --> 03:02:32.990
in residence?  See, they do! And
they're great.  And one of the

03:02:32.991 --> 03:02:36.924
ones was Trey Smith, he has a
science focus and I met him here

03:02:36.925 --> 03:02:40.058
at the library for one of my
consortia meetings and I said,

03:02:40.059 --> 03:02:44.909
okay, we have to work with him. 
So he did a presentation and it

03:02:44.910 --> 03:02:48.828
was wonderful and he did some
analysis and he really -- even

03:02:48.829 --> 03:02:53.878
though he's a scientist, he was
able to find examples of Steam

03:02:53.879 --> 03:02:59.222
objects, and then we invited
in -- we talked about -- we

03:03:00.141 --> 03:03:04.075
invited in two teaching artists
who came in, Ben Bolter, you can

03:03:04.076 --> 03:03:10.579
see his image on your left.  I
think that's right.  He's a

03:03:10.635 --> 03:03:13.969
muralist, but works with science
and STEAM as motivation for

03:03:14.670 --> 03:03:17.598
students, kindergarten through
12th grade to think about ideas.

03:03:19.624 --> 03:03:22.458
Washington, D.C. and worked with
NASA and he came in and talked

03:03:22.459 --> 03:03:25.379
about his practice and his work,
and then we

03:03:28.406 --> 03:03:30.910
 also had another
teacher who talked about her

03:03:31.124 --> 03:03:34.457
work and actually did a project
with teachers, and then we also

03:03:34.458 --> 03:03:39.386
brought in artists who brought
us to the studios, this artist,

03:03:39.387 --> 03:03:43.730
Diane is fascinating, 35 years
she's been flying all over the

03:03:43.731 --> 03:03:46.857
world photographing climate
change, really out of her time

03:03:46.858 --> 03:03:49.689
and taken the photographs and
turned them into prints and she

03:03:49.690 --> 03:03:52.430
lectures and invited to the
White House to talk about her

03:03:52.431 --> 03:03:57.160
work.  And so we had all of
these artists in as we also

03:03:57.766 --> 03:04:01.594
visited lots of primary source
locations as we keep visiting

03:04:01.595 --> 03:04:03.595
the Library's collection online.

03:04:03.620 --> 03:04:08.655
And so that's an example of one
of our overview courses.  We'll

03:04:08.656 --> 03:04:12.392
talk about this one because it's
not there yet, but just a plug

03:04:12.393 --> 03:04:16.230
if anyone wants to join us. 
This year we're developing

03:04:16.552 --> 03:04:20.082
another overview course called
City of the primary source and

03:04:20.083 --> 03:04:25.402
looking at urban planning and
architecture and cartography and

03:04:25.403 --> 03:04:28.954
reaching out to people across
those disciplines to develop

03:04:29.051 --> 03:04:31.582
that curriculum.
In our discipline-specific

03:04:31.880 --> 03:04:35.201
courses we do a deep dive.  So,
again, five days.  What that

03:04:35.403 --> 03:04:38.252
looks like is the first day is,
you know, what is the primary

03:04:38.253 --> 03:04:41.694
source, how do we use it, what
is online and what is in the

03:04:42.281 --> 03:04:45.511
collection?  What is different
about this class is that the

03:04:46.112 --> 03:04:48.346
participants will actually study
one particular discipline and

03:04:48.347 --> 03:04:52.187
they will actually create studio
projects in that discipline, so

03:04:52.188 --> 03:04:55.512
it's important to note they're
not artists, and so they're

03:04:55.920 --> 03:04:58.844
drawing or painting or screen
printing for the first time, and

03:04:58.845 --> 03:05:01.265
so the ideas that they're doing
projects that they can model

03:05:01.470 --> 03:05:04.315
with their students who may not
have comfort in those

03:05:05.000 --> 03:05:08.135
disciplines, and then on day
five they develop a lesson plan

03:05:08.136 --> 03:05:11.355
and share it out and we have an
exhibition.

03:05:11.390 --> 03:05:15.815
So two courses that you can grab
these educator guides, they both

03:05:15.816 --> 03:05:18.542
have guides, one was photography
and identity, so identity was

03:05:18.543 --> 03:05:25.279
mentioned today as an important
factor for art-making.  And we

03:05:25.280 --> 03:05:29.235
used one of the first Lynns in
 Lynn --

03:05:29.435 --> 03:05:32.157
first libraries in America, a
place to look at early

03:05:33.562 --> 03:05:38.900
photographs, and then that
middle image, the images that

03:05:38.901 --> 03:05:43.246
they make themselves in the
class.  And then on the left

03:05:44.157 --> 03:05:48.081
side is the Library of Congress,
and the Library Company image.

03:05:50.011 --> 03:05:51.742
&gt;&gt;  Ann, you have another
minute.

03:05:51.743 --> 03:05:56.050
&gt;&gt;  Okay.  I'm going to go
quickly and say that we also

03:05:56.557 --> 03:05:59.298
create these guides, and I
didn't -- I brought 50 of each

03:05:59.299 --> 03:06:03.036
of them, if you want to grab
one.  They're available free

03:06:03.087 --> 03:06:06.576
online.  So you can download
them or you can contact us, but

03:06:06.577 --> 03:06:11.609
these are materials that you can
see an example of it.  They go

03:06:11.610 --> 03:06:15.250
through the exercise of
analyzing primary sources, and

03:06:15.251 --> 03:06:18.373
we have our web presence.  I
think just to conclude what I

03:06:18.374 --> 03:06:23.016
wanted to say was that this is
an important moment in, and

03:06:23.217 --> 03:06:26.154
preaching to the choir is
important for two reasons.  One

03:06:26.155 --> 03:06:29.079
it lets us be agents of sharing
with colleagues and coworkers

03:06:29.080 --> 03:06:32.631
that may not have access to some
language and vocabulary around

03:06:32.632 --> 03:06:37.063
what we all do, but it also
gives us resources to do what we

03:06:37.064 --> 03:06:42.608
do a little bit differently.
So thank you all and I was very

03:06:42.609 --> 03:06:44.609
proud to be here today.
[Applause]

03:06:51.063 --> 03:06:55.513
&gt;&gt;  So I mentioned primary
sources consortium and the next

03:06:55.514 --> 03:06:58.750
speaker comes from another one
of our consortiums, member

03:06:59.456 --> 03:07:03.181
organizations, and that is the
National Association -- excuse

03:07:03.182 --> 03:07:10.042
me -- I've got the -- you know
how acronyms do that to you.  So

03:07:10.043 --> 03:07:14.187
anyway... Johanna Siebert is
here today to talk with us about

03:07:14.188 --> 03:07:17.199
a really special project
involving the new national

03:07:17.810 --> 03:07:22.847
standards for music that were
recently developed by NAFME.

03:07:22.871 --> 03:07:26.559
&gt;&gt;  Thank you.  The National
Association for Music Education.

03:07:32.544 --> 03:07:35.484
You can understand it can be
used in a lot of ways.  So I

03:07:35.580 --> 03:07:38.610
will slip back and forth between
the two, I think, as I talk. 

03:07:38.611 --> 03:07:41.656
But thank you very much and
thank you for having us here

03:07:41.714 --> 03:07:44.660
today.  I'm the project director
for this project that you're

03:07:44.970 --> 03:07:48.122
going to hear about today, and
let's get used to this.  Here we

03:07:48.123 --> 03:07:51.031
go.
And so in our collaboration with

03:07:51.032 --> 03:07:55.670
the Library of Congress, a good
friend, colleague and director

03:07:55.671 --> 03:08:01.327
at NAFME wrote a proposal, you
can see on the screens pretty

03:08:01.328 --> 03:08:05.468
much what it is what we want to
do through the grants available

03:08:05.469 --> 03:08:09.967
to us.  And so looking at the
three-year program we just

03:08:11.018 --> 03:08:16.779
completed, this past summer,
study curricular units, not a

03:08:16.780 --> 03:08:19.986
curricula itself, but in music,
right now as we speak I'm

03:08:20.295 --> 03:08:23.516
receiving emails with draft
units for band and orchestra and

03:08:23.517 --> 03:08:26.454
new teams writing them, and in
the third year we'll be looking

03:08:26.455 --> 03:08:30.487
at composition and theory as
well as popular music on how we

03:08:30.488 --> 03:08:33.419
can access the multiple
resources that we actually just

03:08:33.420 --> 03:08:37.973
got done looking at, as well as
many, many more.

03:08:37.997 --> 03:08:42.704
Behind the whole idea of these
new national standards is the

03:08:42.705 --> 03:08:47.257
idea of building student
artistic literacy.  We've heard

03:08:47.258 --> 03:08:50.977
that word this morning.  Many of
you are nodding.  Many of the

03:08:50.978 --> 03:08:54.310
things that have been said
already really validated the

03:08:54.925 --> 03:08:59.063
standards and the collaboration
we now have here at the library.

03:09:01.471 --> 03:09:05.307
children is huge.  It's not just
knowing about music, but it's

03:09:05.308 --> 03:09:09.546
about being in the music or in
any other art form.  And so we

03:09:09.547 --> 03:09:12.287
think about all of these and we
still know we have to keep

03:09:13.390 --> 03:09:15.672
bringing in all that knowledge
and skills in the past because

03:09:15.673 --> 03:09:20.153
as we heard this morning, there
is a lot of skill basis in music

03:09:20.154 --> 03:09:24.091
and it be taught sequentially. 
We can't lose that.  And that's

03:09:24.092 --> 03:09:29.737
what a lot of teachers are very
comfortable with.  So we've been

03:09:29.738 --> 03:09:33.675
working on these and kind of
been learning as we go.  As we

03:09:33.676 --> 03:09:37.018
see a shift to a process-based
literacy piece, you're looking

03:09:37.019 --> 03:09:42.761
at the four major processes we
talk about.  We heard about how

03:09:42.762 --> 03:09:46.702
there are steps to this and
composing and improvising and

03:09:46.703 --> 03:09:52.549
arranging, whether talking pre-K
level.  Sure, switch the opening

03:09:52.550 --> 03:09:56.895
routines, or college-bound
seniors that will major in

03:09:56.900 --> 03:10:01.439
music.  We talk about
performing, which the music is

03:10:01.440 --> 03:10:05.176
what we're known for, what we
do.  Responding is our focus

03:10:05.469 --> 03:10:08.605
area for this unit but we heard
this morning about another

03:10:09.416 --> 03:10:11.416
process and how important
personal connections from

03:10:11.625 --> 03:10:14.753
students through the arts to
other arts to other areas in

03:10:14.860 --> 03:10:20.004
their lives and to other
disciplines are important.  So

03:10:20.005 --> 03:10:23.629
to show you all the things we
need to think about, we have

03:10:23.846 --> 03:10:26.673
five sets of standards in the
new arts standards.  So we talk

03:10:26.674 --> 03:10:32.320
about general music from pre-K
up to grade 8, grade by grade

03:10:32.321 --> 03:10:36.644
with successes, ideals of what
we believe, literacy would look

03:10:36.645 --> 03:10:38.979
like in those grades,
traditional and emerging

03:10:40.280 --> 03:10:45.019
ensembles, big choruses, bands,
orchestras, and all the

03:10:45.326 --> 03:10:48.253
different kinds of ensembles you
can think of.  We talk about

03:10:48.454 --> 03:10:53.310
comp or theory, writing and
analyzing of music, harmonizing

03:10:53.311 --> 03:10:59.767
instruments, making the bridge
between students' music of their

03:10:59.768 --> 03:11:03.004
eyes and student music they're
playing in school, you know, via

03:11:03.005 --> 03:11:08.143
guitars, United Kingdom lay
Lees, other harm nicing pieces

03:11:08.144 --> 03:11:13.280
and other technology.  As these
were rolled out in 2014 and

03:11:14.086 --> 03:11:18.022
continue to be now, we found
that teachers really needed to

03:11:18.023 --> 03:11:21.955
have some extra resources.  So
during that period and even as I

03:11:21.956 --> 03:11:29.204
say up to this state, we are
focusing at NAfME how we can

03:11:29.515 --> 03:11:31.940
help that.  In order to
understand, I'm walking you

03:11:32.343 --> 03:11:34.674
briefly through our standards,
which would take another three

03:11:34.675 --> 03:11:37.797
days, but you can see laid out
here the processes that we are

03:11:37.798 --> 03:11:43.765
talking about creating, studying
at the pre-K level will that

03:11:43.952 --> 03:11:45.877
kind of writing or talking that
I heard about this morning is

03:11:45.878 --> 03:11:48.905
exactly what we mean and having
students be able to go through

03:11:48.906 --> 03:11:53.159
the four steps in an order, is
often how we make sure they are

03:11:53.160 --> 03:11:57.297
writing, they're refining.  When
students perform they do just

03:11:57.298 --> 03:12:00.735
that.  We help their analyzing
and interpreting the music they

03:12:00.736 --> 03:12:04.364
choose to perform.  They
rehearse an evaluate themselves

03:12:04.365 --> 03:12:07.813
and refine what they do so they
are ready for the last stage to

03:12:07.814 --> 03:12:10.735
present it.
Of course, the facilitation of a

03:12:10.736 --> 03:12:13.354
teacher and guided by the
teacher but eventually taking

03:12:13.355 --> 03:12:16.296
this process on.  And the
responding is a little

03:12:17.403 --> 03:12:20.033
different, even though the
little block looks the same. 

03:12:20.034 --> 03:12:23.565
The components talk a lot about
how students respond to the

03:12:24.561 --> 03:12:26.989
selection, analysis and
interpretation and evaluation of

03:12:26.990 --> 03:12:31.528
other people's musics.  Whether
it's music they listen to in a

03:12:31.529 --> 03:12:33.865
performance or another
composer's music.  Not

03:12:34.241 --> 03:12:36.802
necessarily what they're going
to create themselves as

03:12:36.810 --> 03:12:40.033
performers.
What you see across the bottom

03:12:40.034 --> 03:12:42.955
is the black that talks about
connecting.  We talk about how

03:12:42.956 --> 03:12:46.485
we relate to things and how we
inner-relate to things through

03:12:46.486 --> 03:12:50.533
music for students.  So you see
really the gamut of what we have

03:12:50.534 --> 03:12:54.657
and how using these we hope are
going to help us develop

03:12:54.967 --> 03:12:57.401
students into that music
literate performer and thinker.

03:12:59.000 --> 03:13:03.753
As we focus on responding, the
idea is that if we help students

03:13:03.754 --> 03:13:08.090
understand and evaluate how the
arts convey meaning, and you can

03:13:08.091 --> 03:13:12.019
see here the definitions and
what it looks like in those

03:13:12.426 --> 03:13:15.765
four -- not necessarily
successes or linear components. 

03:13:15.766 --> 03:13:19.387
But the ideal, again, is how do
we get to this?  What are the

03:13:19.388 --> 03:13:24.841
things we're using for this?
The problem that we've had is

03:13:24.842 --> 03:13:30.297
that in ensembles, harmonizing
music and some classrooms they

03:13:30.298 --> 03:13:34.438
don't lend themselves to the
study of responding.  And we

03:13:34.640 --> 03:13:37.872
need to make that happen for
teachers.  Heavily based on

03:13:38.171 --> 03:13:40.091
skills, instruction,
development, maintenance, and

03:13:40.092 --> 03:13:43.628
all of those things.  So where
does the talk time come to

03:13:44.129 --> 03:13:48.176
respond to music?  If the goal
of class is to perform

03:13:48.379 --> 03:13:50.893
something, what are they basing
that on?  How do we help

03:13:51.407 --> 03:13:55.139
teachers find time to realize by
focusing and responding we can

03:13:55.140 --> 03:13:59.168
help them be better performers. 
And as we think about assessment

03:13:59.169 --> 03:14:08.250
in any field... woo! I think of
120 students in a course I used

03:14:08.251 --> 03:14:10.930
to supervise and I thought, how
are you knowing what each one

03:14:10.931 --> 03:14:14.418
knows?
Typical problems that we've had.

03:14:20.638 --> 03:14:23.157
resources here from the Library
of Congress, we're working to be

03:14:23.158 --> 03:14:27.094
able to take the responding
components that we've looked at

03:14:27.095 --> 03:14:30.737
and now after students have
responded and had the chance and

03:14:30.738 --> 03:14:34.359
the opportunity to listen deeply
and to think about how music

03:14:34.563 --> 03:14:39.104
came to be written and
performed, now apply that in a

03:14:39.105 --> 03:14:42.745
performing strand, if you will,
so students are relying on what

03:14:42.746 --> 03:14:44.562
I like to call reference points.

03:14:44.563 --> 03:14:48.501
As I go to interpret a piece of
music, oh, this is how this was

03:14:48.502 --> 03:14:53.754
interpreted and now I have it in
my head that I can draw upon. 

03:14:53.755 --> 03:14:56.675
So by using the mission
statement of a Library of

03:14:56.770 --> 03:15:00.105
Congress we find that these two
fit very well together.  By

03:15:00.923 --> 03:15:03.644
addressing a learning and
knowledge and history and

03:15:04.238 --> 03:15:07.261
relevance of all of what we've
been talking about this morning

03:15:07.262 --> 03:15:10.812
and seeing in the room next door
and throughout the building, we

03:15:10.813 --> 03:15:15.137
tie that to how students use
that creativitily and how they

03:15:15.138 --> 03:15:18.241
use it also in performing,
composition and analysis.

03:15:21.499 --> 03:15:29.155
So work of writing teams.  We
looked at music 2, 5, 8 this

03:15:29.363 --> 03:15:32.591
past year.  We have units in
those.  We have units in chorus,

03:15:32.592 --> 03:15:36.032
the five levels you have,
gradually progressing levels

03:15:36.237 --> 03:15:39.652
that don't necessarily focus on
a gray level because the

03:15:40.658 --> 03:15:44.004
ensembles don't meet that way. 
They meet as choirs or as a band

03:15:44.005 --> 03:15:48.933
or ensemble with all bit on
audition students and it can

03:15:49.240 --> 03:15:51.449
look different from one district
in the country to another, from

03:15:51.450 --> 03:15:54.891
urban to rural to suburban
settings.

03:15:54.914 --> 03:15:59.031
You're going to respond in
standards.  We've been able to

03:15:59.032 --> 03:16:02.156
guide instruction via the
inquiry models that are part of

03:16:02.157 --> 03:16:04.294
the grant proposal and using
that through the Library of

03:16:04.345 --> 03:16:07.219
Congress.  We have our own
essential questions embedded in

03:16:07.220 --> 03:16:12.153
the national standards as well
as enduring understandings.

03:16:12.176 --> 03:16:16.703
So I want to talk to you and --
make sure you keep me on my

03:16:16.901 --> 03:16:18.439
time.
&gt;&gt;  You're getting close.

03:16:18.440 --> 03:16:22.047
&gt;&gt;  This is one of the grade 2
units.  It talks about our

03:16:22.551 --> 03:16:24.986
objective through our TAM
statements, this is what

03:16:25.096 --> 03:16:28.215
students in school are using
throughout the country.  A dance

03:16:28.216 --> 03:16:31.545
unit or a movement unit.  The
essential question:  How are

03:16:32.155 --> 03:16:35.079
music and movement alike?  Why
does music make me move or

03:16:35.277 --> 03:16:38.227
dance?  You can see performance
standards listed as well.

03:16:38.250 --> 03:16:40.832
So the opening activity that a
teacher would lead would be

03:16:41.548 --> 03:16:43.672
reviewing some skills and how do
we move, what are different ways

03:16:43.673 --> 03:16:49.514
to move?  She would extend it by
asking them to add new movements

03:16:49.515 --> 03:16:52.557
to the piece and think about how
they walk and, again, vocabulary

03:16:52.558 --> 03:16:57.701
ready for students at that age.
The opening activity -- John is

03:16:57.702 --> 03:17:01.767
going to help in the back.  I
like it.  By clicking on one of

03:17:01.768 --> 03:17:04.173
the jukebox recordings that she
used as the introduction. 

03:17:04.480 --> 03:17:06.480
Thanks, John.  Go ahead.

03:17:25.722 --> 03:17:30.470
&gt;&gt;  Thank you, John.  So we'll
keep it short so you can hear. 

03:17:30.471 --> 03:17:32.997
You couldn't imagine
second-graders reacting to that,

03:17:32.998 --> 03:17:35.844
sometimes we wish they weren't
reacting to that.  What that

03:17:35.845 --> 03:17:39.078
would be like.  And you can see
also -- I'm wondering, do I need

03:17:39.079 --> 03:17:41.298
to click ahead?  I'm looking
back to...

03:17:41.321 --> 03:17:44.439
Thank you very much.  The
questions that she's asking

03:17:44.736 --> 03:17:48.469
through various types of
prompting and inquiry are kind

03:17:48.470 --> 03:17:53.721
of those things, and she was
using a visual thinking model. 

03:17:53.722 --> 03:17:56.860
It looks a little different in
chorus.  In chorus we talk

03:17:57.048 --> 03:18:01.393
about, what could this be like? 
This intermediate level now for

03:18:01.394 --> 03:18:05.713
the most part middle school
students, depending when they

03:18:05.714 --> 03:18:08.654
start chorus in a district like
yours.  All the units there are

03:18:08.655 --> 03:18:12.601
focused on multiple things. 
This level we focused on folk

03:18:12.602 --> 03:18:15.222
music and you saw a lot of
materials next door about that. 

03:18:15.223 --> 03:18:20.285
High school level they focused
on spirituals.  So we know

03:18:20.376 --> 03:18:23.181
students will be singing
spirituals sometime throughout

03:18:23.182 --> 03:18:27.737
their career.  They use the
Socratic circle model and

03:18:28.046 --> 03:18:30.359
includes outside work.  I'm not
going to click on the link now

03:18:30.360 --> 03:18:33.098
because I want to make sure that
you have access to this

03:18:33.295 --> 03:18:35.516
PowerPoint and it will be
embedded for you.

03:18:35.542 --> 03:18:39.353
So I think what we're showing
you is that through what we talk

03:18:39.354 --> 03:18:44.515
about these processes become
interdependent much as literacy

03:18:44.516 --> 03:18:47.642
is dependent upon many other
things as well.  As we look at

03:18:47.643 --> 03:18:51.837
the practices you see here, we
know to truly pulled

03:18:51.891 --> 03:18:55.013
understanding that we want
students to be able to transfer

03:18:55.014 --> 03:18:59.044
what they've learned to new
situations and learnings and

03:18:59.946 --> 03:19:03.375
experiences so their learning
continues to grow.  It shows us

03:19:03.376 --> 03:19:07.515
more and more the rigor of what
we can accomplish by going

03:19:07.723 --> 03:19:09.723
through stages like this and
connecting some of the

03:19:10.140 --> 03:19:13.478
responding artifacts, lessons
that in turn will help students

03:19:13.479 --> 03:19:18.012
focus on their own performance
and make all their ensemble work

03:19:18.013 --> 03:19:20.013
even strong per 

03:19:21.846 --> 03:19:23.963
 stronger.
You can see one of the things

03:19:23.964 --> 03:19:26.800
worried about is the time it
will take in choruses and large

03:19:26.801 --> 03:19:30.032
ensembles and the person's
testament here talked about how

03:19:30.033 --> 03:19:33.357
she could fit these into her
daily routine, and the units

03:19:33.559 --> 03:19:36.482
show that.
The students loved it.  One of

03:19:36.483 --> 03:19:40.327
the comments they made you'll
understand because you just

03:19:40.425 --> 03:19:43.547
heard the run-run-run example. 
They talked about in that old

03:19:43.548 --> 03:19:47.480
school music sound, thinking
that's how we all learn music or

03:19:47.481 --> 03:19:52.793
through scratchy recordings, so
a little disk agography gets

03:19:52.795 --> 03:19:56.464
taught at the same time.
These units we made available to

03:19:56.465 --> 03:20:00.203
everybody.  We were just talking
about having people enroll in

03:20:00.204 --> 03:20:04.345
the courses.  We recently
presented our grade 8 general

03:20:04.346 --> 03:20:09.282
music unit, a national social
studies conference.  I watched a

03:20:09.283 --> 03:20:11.608
colleague who was presenting
with me and we were meeting in a

03:20:11.609 --> 03:20:16.561
poster sex and -- a poster 
session.  She

03:20:16.972 --> 03:20:21.099
started taking down requests for
different periods of time that

03:20:21.100 --> 03:20:25.141
the social studies teachers
wanted so they could connect it

03:20:25.142 --> 03:20:28.878
to music.  They were doing it
already.  I guess we have a few

03:20:28.879 --> 03:20:31.317
more things to think about this
third year as we start writing

03:20:31.318 --> 03:20:36.255
these.  The units are available
at that website or just go to

03:20:36.865 --> 03:20:41.000
NAfME and watch the headers that
go by and you'll see the units

03:20:41.001 --> 03:20:43.736
you can link to and use. 
Anybody can use these.  You

03:20:43.926 --> 03:20:48.269
don't need to be a member.  But
I hope you do.

03:20:48.294 --> 03:20:50.691
I guess I'm going to wait for
questions for a little while. 

03:20:50.692 --> 03:20:53.977
So I hope to hear from you. 
Thank you very much.

03:20:57.045 --> 03:20:59.045
[Applause]

03:21:00.879 --> 03:21:04.091
&gt;&gt;  Thank you, Johanna.  Both

03:21:07.109 --> 03:21:09.842
 of
the projects, you are doing such

03:21:09.843 --> 03:21:14.686
important work and reaching so
many teachers, and the library's

03:21:14.687 --> 03:21:18.107
collections as you know come in
a wide variety of media and I'm

03:21:18.108 --> 03:21:20.936
really glad you played that part
from the national jukebox.  How

03:21:20.937 --> 03:21:24.872
many of you know about the
National Jukebox on the

03:21:24.876 --> 03:21:28.433
Library's website, that it has
historical record something now

03:21:28.434 --> 03:21:32.862
you do.  There's 38 million
things on the Library's website.

03:21:35.982 --> 03:21:39.013
music, sound recordings, really
I hope that after this you all

03:21:39.014 --> 03:21:42.559
spend some time doing some
exploring and realize -- this is

03:21:42.560 --> 03:21:45.176
a really important part, that
because this is the Library of

03:21:45.177 --> 03:21:50.134
Congress, this is our national
library.  All of these resources

03:21:50.135 --> 03:21:52.948
are ours collectively.  We
should be making good use of

03:21:52.956 --> 03:21:56.073
them.
Okay.  So with that, not only

03:21:56.074 --> 03:22:00.013
can the Library's collections be
tremendous teaching tools, but

03:22:00.014 --> 03:22:03.250
the Library itself can do.  How
many of you have never spent

03:22:03.447 --> 03:22:07.281
time in the Library's Jefferson
Building?

03:22:07.304 --> 03:22:12.146
Okay, some of you.  All right. 
So as you know, this building

03:22:12.147 --> 03:22:15.672
we're in today is not the most
beautiful as the Library of

03:22:15.873 --> 03:22:18.407
Congress buildings.  The
building next door, the Thomas

03:22:18.408 --> 03:22:23.338
Jefferson Building is quite
extraordinary.  And our next

03:22:25.651 --> 03:22:28.390
panelist is Kathy Tuchman, she
works with visitor of services

03:22:28.391 --> 03:22:32.816
office here at the library and
has developed a really

03:22:34.126 --> 03:22:36.550
extraordinary tour.  This is a
history tour, and some of you

03:22:36.551 --> 03:22:39.598
had a chance to visit a little
bit ago in the next room to

03:22:39.796 --> 03:22:42.327
share with you the discovery
card, and that's all I'm going

03:22:42.328 --> 03:22:46.246
to say.  Kathy, it's your turn.
&gt;&gt;  Thank you.  I'm just going

03:22:46.247 --> 03:22:52.299
to move my stuff over here real
quickly.  My name is Kathy

03:22:52.504 --> 03:22:55.549
Tuchman with visitor services
office at the Library of

03:22:55.941 --> 03:22:58.858
Congress, and this past year and
a half I've had this fantastic

03:22:58.859 --> 03:23:02.295
opportunity to work on two
projects, and a lot of you may

03:23:02.296 --> 03:23:06.332
have been able to see the
projects I was working on.  The

03:23:06.333 --> 03:23:11.072
first is the explorer, the
building cart, which we had up

03:23:11.073 --> 03:23:16.423
earlier.  The visitor services
received this fantastic box of

03:23:16.424 --> 03:23:19.862
original materials that we used
in our construction of the

03:23:20.520 --> 03:23:23.106
building and my colleague, Megan
White and I worked on this

03:23:23.161 --> 03:23:29.450
together.  We went from
researching everything from how

03:23:29.451 --> 03:23:31.964
bricks were made to how the
coring methods of granite and

03:23:31.965 --> 03:23:34.594
marble, so that way we could
interact and have all the

03:23:34.998 --> 03:23:37.528
answers or try to have some of
the answers at least for our

03:23:37.827 --> 03:23:43.379
visitors.  A bit of the cart
program you want to know.  It's

03:23:43.380 --> 03:23:46.105
a way for visitors to come to
the building and interact in a

03:23:46.106 --> 03:23:49.140
totally different way, where
they can get hands-on, feel the

03:23:49.141 --> 03:23:53.479
original pieces of the building
and they can ask questions.  A

03:23:53.480 --> 03:23:56.411
lot of times people come up and
tell me they were

03:23:56.701 --> 03:23:59.033
third-generation carver, they
want to share their experiences

03:23:59.034 --> 03:24:04.175
as well.  So it's a really
fantastic experience.  They are

03:24:04.176 --> 03:24:07.610
trained on the cart material. 
They have gone through a

03:24:07.812 --> 03:24:10.236
training program and have a
wonderful manual, and so we're

03:24:10.237 --> 03:24:13.462
there to support them.
The other project that I was

03:24:13.865 --> 03:24:17.394
lucky to work on this past year
was the history program, the

03:24:17.796 --> 03:24:23.155
tour for the blind and visually
impaired.  We in visitor

03:24:23.755 --> 03:24:28.096
services have fantastic tours. 
We offer constituents, public

03:24:28.097 --> 03:24:30.718
reserve tours throughout the
day.  Our dough

03:24:33.747 --> 03:24:38.190
  Our docents go through a
training program for a total of

03:24:38.191 --> 03:24:42.127
150 hours just toshire with you
that this is a well-developed,

03:24:42.128 --> 03:24:47.174
well-researched tour, not just
thrown together quickly.  The

03:24:47.675 --> 03:24:54.526
docents that are chosen to do
touch history have been docents

03:24:54.527 --> 03:24:57.359
at least one year, not
completely new to the program. 

03:24:57.360 --> 03:25:01.502
The touch history we enhance
verbally our normal tour.  So we

03:25:01.503 --> 03:25:05.528
have great history.  That's
similar.  But then we go into

03:25:05.529 --> 03:25:13.598
more descriptive ability at the
building, give people -- we

03:25:13.891 --> 03:25:17.420
reached out to the capitol and
let them know we were working on

03:25:17.421 --> 03:25:20.476
this project and they were
incredibly generous with us. 

03:25:20.477 --> 03:25:23.091
Many of you saw I have an
original brick here.  A lot of

03:25:23.092 --> 03:25:26.014
people don't know that the
Jefferson Building is a brick

03:25:26.015 --> 03:25:29.253
building.  22 million bricks
went into the construction of

03:25:29.254 --> 03:25:31.781
this building but you don't see
them.  People don't realize

03:25:32.079 --> 03:25:37.128
that.  I have a brick, you can
feel it.  It's quite heavy. 

03:25:37.235 --> 03:25:42.171
Also a piece of the granite.  We
have like a cross-section.  You

03:25:42.172 --> 03:25:45.901
have the granite on the exterior
and the brick plaster and then,

03:25:45.902 --> 03:25:49.338
of course, the marble.  If
you've been in the building you

03:25:49.339 --> 03:25:52.671
have seen we are marble.  That
is just like the icing on the

03:25:52.672 --> 03:25:57.625
cake there.  It's marble
cladding.  And this allows

03:25:58.033 --> 03:26:01.063
visitors doing a touch history
tour, I can hand it to the

03:26:01.266 --> 03:26:03.687
visitors and they can feel and
interact them and feel the

03:26:04.182 --> 03:26:07.713
coolness, the smoothness of the
surfaces, depending on their

03:26:08.123 --> 03:26:10.956
visual ability they can maybe
want to reach up and look at it

03:26:10.957 --> 03:26:12.957
closely.

03:26:18.315 --> 03:26:23.343
I want to back up a little also
because I want to talk about the

03:26:23.344 --> 03:26:26.078
ceiling, the architecture of
this, which was fantastic.  I

03:26:26.079 --> 03:26:29.722
have original pieces of the
marble mosaic, which I didn't

03:26:29.723 --> 03:26:32.248
turn over with me, but the
architect -- if you've been in

03:26:32.249 --> 03:26:35.487
the building you've seen three
Al coves are

03:26:38.518 --> 03:26:40.531
 mosaic ceilings and
the architect put them on a

03:26:40.826 --> 03:26:43.653
wooden base so we can hand them
out and let the visitors feel

03:26:43.654 --> 03:26:51.106
this and get a sense of the
incredible artistry involved in

03:26:51.107 --> 03:26:53.940
doing these ceilings.  So that's
just a little about the why and

03:26:53.941 --> 03:26:58.582
how we did it.  We also have
been working -- I researched and

03:26:58.583 --> 03:27:01.918
went to a lot of museums to see
what they were doing in New York

03:27:01.919 --> 03:27:06.062
and here in Washington.  We
researched online to see what

03:27:06.063 --> 03:27:10.298
best practices are in the museum
world and doing tactile tours. 

03:27:10.299 --> 03:27:16.455
Luckily we have a fantastic
EEODP division here, our equal

03:27:16.456 --> 03:27:21.689
opportunity disability programs
and we worked with Lorrainea bad

03:27:21.690 --> 03:27:25.722
Ford from the National Gallery
of Art and had a wonderful

03:27:26.030 --> 03:27:28.920
review with her.
So let me tell you about -- I

03:27:28.921 --> 03:27:35.724
told you we do a descriptive. 
So let me -- if I can -- this is

03:27:35.725 --> 03:27:38.465
going to be fun -- let me give
you a little bit of tour coming

03:27:38.466 --> 03:27:41.389
into the building.  If you've
never been in the building this

03:27:41.390 --> 03:27:46.341
will be exciting.  So it's
Jefferson -- Library of

03:27:46.637 --> 03:27:51.075
Congress -- let's back up, it
was created 1800. first 97 years

03:27:51.076 --> 03:27:53.720
were spent in the capitol. 
That's where we began.

03:27:57.143 --> 03:28:00.360
  Then at
that time they could see us

03:28:00.969 --> 03:28:04.193
expanding services and wanted a
larger building, so Congress

03:28:04.809 --> 03:28:07.433
appropriated the funds to build
the Jefferson Building.  Let's

03:28:07.434 --> 03:28:10.677
talk about the Jefferson
Building.  Walk up the grand

03:28:10.774 --> 03:28:13.707
staircase and come into the
building, into the first Al

03:28:14.205 --> 03:28:18.541
cove, which is Minerva.  There
are four alcoves that surround

03:28:18.542 --> 03:28:21.158
the hall.  The first is Minerva.

03:28:21.599 --> 03:28:26.001
You walk in and there are eight
pairs of Minerva, goddess of

03:28:26.317 --> 03:28:29.541
wisdom and descent of war.  And
walk through one of the three

03:28:29.542 --> 03:28:32.279
arches into the great hall.  The
building is fantastic in

03:28:32.476 --> 03:28:36.720
symmetry.  On one side, it's
equally on the opposite.  If

03:28:36.816 --> 03:28:39.550
it's on the left, it's on the
right.  I love this building. 

03:28:39.551 --> 03:28:42.692
So we're now standing in the
great hall.  Let's orient

03:28:42.881 --> 03:28:47.123
ourselves.  In the great hall. 
Lots of sound, really noisy. 

03:28:47.124 --> 03:28:50.046
The great hall is called that
because it's pretty large.  It's

03:28:50.047 --> 03:28:54.589
50 feet across and about 43 feet
from front to the next set of

03:28:54.590 --> 03:28:59.843
arches.  It's 75 feet to the
ceiling.  So quite large.  From

03:28:59.844 --> 03:29:03.816
where we're standing if we were
to look up we can see up to the

03:29:03.817 --> 03:29:06.925
mezzanine level and there is a
marble bannister that runs all

03:29:06.926 --> 03:29:11.046
around.  So the mezzanine level
is available to us, the sound of

03:29:11.047 --> 03:29:16.795
it, so it's quite loud.  On the
left-hand side of the great hall

03:29:16.796 --> 03:29:19.701
the grand staircases, these are
fantastic. about nine feet wide.

03:29:22.653 --> 03:29:27.295
And, of course, on the side of
the staircase we could have left

03:29:27.296 --> 03:29:31.934
them plain but why would we do
that?  This is 1897, why would

03:29:31.935 --> 03:29:34.764
we want to do that?  We have
fantastic sculptures going up

03:29:34.765 --> 03:29:39.499
the sides and they are called
pute.  A lot of them refer to

03:29:39.500 --> 03:29:45.046
them as cherubs, but like little
babies.  We have four, and then

03:29:45.047 --> 03:29:48.194
a landing and four more.  Eight
on the left and eight on the

03:29:48.296 --> 03:29:51.233
right.  I'm going to talk about
the four on my left, if we're in

03:29:51.234 --> 03:29:53.234
the building.

03:29:55.761 --> 03:30:01.810
[ speaker is off microphone ]
&gt;&gt;  When you're going up the --

03:30:01.811 --> 03:30:05.858
the putie are in a window, like
a little house.  There are four

03:30:05.859 --> 03:30:10.111
of them and aligned next to each
other.  The first is sitting on

03:30:10.112 --> 03:30:13.744
his knees facing us directly and
in his right hand he has a rake

03:30:13.745 --> 03:30:17.279
and a hoe.  Left hand he has a
watering can.  We can see the

03:30:17.280 --> 03:30:23.029
water coming out of it.  So he
would be our what?  Our

03:30:23.159 --> 03:30:28.285
gardener, correct?  Next would
be our -- he has an angle to us,

03:30:28.286 --> 03:30:33.327
this next little putie.  He is
facing the left.  His left hand

03:30:33.328 --> 03:30:37.457
is reaching out trying to get to
the gardener and in his right

03:30:37.458 --> 03:30:42.198
hand is a butterfly net.  And he
is our entomologist.  We're

03:30:42.406 --> 03:30:46.346
showing that the putie have
different occupations and

03:30:46.532 --> 03:30:47.749
hobbies or all represented here.

03:30:47.750 --> 03:30:51.386
And this is a fantastic thing
for the kids to come and they

03:30:51.387 --> 03:30:54.829
can interact and try to show
them which -- what do you think

03:30:54.830 --> 03:30:56.830
this putie does?

03:31:04.198 --> 03:31:10.357
The last two, one is sitting
there, the last is sitting there

03:31:10.358 --> 03:31:16.608
with a book on his lap and he's
a scholar.  And last but not

03:31:18.331 --> 03:31:22.548
least would be our printer,
because where would we be

03:31:22.767 --> 03:31:25.480
without the library printing. 
So we have those on either side

03:31:25.481 --> 03:31:28.723
of the building going up.  It's
a great opportunity to be

03:31:30.236 --> 03:31:33.564
expansive in description with
our visitors who have visual

03:31:33.973 --> 03:31:37.096
impairments and kids when they
come into the building, we can

03:31:37.097 --> 03:31:40.034
bring the building to life.
The last thing I want to mention

03:31:40.035 --> 03:31:43.457
about the great hall, did I
mention that you can park about

03:31:43.458 --> 03:31:47.327
ten cars on the floor of our
great hall?  It's a fun thing to

03:31:47.328 --> 03:31:53.473
mention.  It gives you a sense
of the size.  Across from us, I

03:31:53.474 --> 03:31:56.204
told you the staircase, but
directly across from the arches

03:31:56.205 --> 03:32:00.748
that we're standing at, we have
three more arches.  And I

03:32:01.765 --> 03:32:06.093
mentioned the middle arch, we
have the father, the young

03:32:06.494 --> 03:32:09.934
and -- the scholars, the young
and old.  Important to mention. 

03:32:09.935 --> 03:32:13.066
They stand six feet in height. 
Young scholar on the left-hand

03:32:13.067 --> 03:32:17.610
side, he's leaning into his left
arm.  He has left leg crossed

03:32:17.611 --> 03:32:23.248
behind him and looking to his
right.  And, of course, he's

03:32:23.657 --> 03:32:27.706
learning.  And on the right-hand
side is our older scholar, and

03:32:27.707 --> 03:32:31.474
we know he's old because he has
a beard, his skin is a little

03:32:31.475 --> 03:32:35.470
bit looser.  And he has a
tablet.  And, of course, when

03:32:35.471 --> 03:32:39.002
the building was built they
might have been implying that

03:32:39.003 --> 03:32:43.951
the young scholar had the newer
technology, paper, and the old

03:32:43.952 --> 03:32:48.501
scholar had the tablet, but
today the older scholar really

03:32:48.502 --> 03:32:51.421
has the latest technology,
correct?

03:32:51.450 --> 03:32:54.544
[chuckles]
A good laugh.

03:32:54.568 --> 03:32:59.910
To finish a bit of our tour, I
would take us to our left-hand

03:32:59.911 --> 03:33:03.134
side out of the great hall into
the hall of the education, into

03:33:03.135 --> 03:33:06.374
the hall of family, and I like
to mention this hall because

03:33:06.573 --> 03:33:10.609
this one, you come in and it's
about 70 feet long, 20 feet

03:33:10.817 --> 03:33:17.061
wide, and it's about 26 feet
tall, about.  It's got an

03:33:18.076 --> 03:33:21.198
archway, which is where some of
the beautiful mosaics come in. 

03:33:21.199 --> 03:33:24.955
They're not only decorative, but
they also have information this

03:33:24.956 --> 03:33:29.889
them, and our ceiling, the hall
of the family, we have great

03:33:30.090 --> 03:33:37.158
edge day terse, and 1897, the
librarian, the first name is

03:33:37.458 --> 03:33:43.298
Howe.  H-O-W-E.  Anyone heard of
Samly Ridley Howe.  Some have. 

03:33:43.299 --> 03:33:46.235
The first superintendent of the
Perkins School for the Blind,

03:33:46.236 --> 03:33:50.777
which is important to note.
Next his name is Gallaudet,

03:33:51.271 --> 03:33:53.004
which was the first
superintendent for the school

03:33:53.005 --> 03:33:59.249
for the deaf.  In 1897 both the
blind and the deaf were listed

03:33:59.250 --> 03:34:02.780
in our building, that's
important.  Also I have to

03:34:02.988 --> 03:34:07.122
mention this alcove is the
listing of all the librarians of

03:34:07.123 --> 03:34:10.170
Congress that we have, as I love
to mention on our tour, and

03:34:10.577 --> 03:34:14.107
visitors are allowed to go feel
this.  When the building opened

03:34:14.108 --> 03:34:18.956
in 1897 we had only one woman's
name in the building.  It was

03:34:18.957 --> 03:34:25.223
1897, and that was Saffa.  As of
last year we now have a second

03:34:25.224 --> 03:34:31.577
name.  Dr. Carla Hayden is
engraved in our building.  It's

03:34:31.578 --> 03:34:35.317
really fantastic.  I hope you
enjoyed my little brief tour and

03:34:35.318 --> 03:34:38.438
the wonderful opportunities that
we have to engage with visitors

03:34:38.439 --> 03:34:41.469
in a whole different way and if
you didn't get to see the CART,

03:34:41.470 --> 03:34:44.614
we still have it.  So thank you
very much.

03:34:44.640 --> 03:34:46.640
[Applause]

03:34:53.065 --> 03:34:56.291
&gt;&gt;  Thank you.  The Thomas
Jefferson Building Kathy has

03:34:56.504 --> 03:34:59.730
been telling you about welcomes
1.5 million visitors a year, and

03:34:59.731 --> 03:35:03.783
a few thousand of those visitors
make their way into our young

03:35:03.784 --> 03:35:08.204
readers center, which is also a
part of the Library of Congress,

03:35:08.205 --> 03:35:12.346
and every Friday morning at
10:30, if you want to see

03:35:12.644 --> 03:35:15.676
something pretty spectacular,
you can come to infant and

03:35:16.081 --> 03:35:18.806
toddler story time at the
Library of Congress.  And it's

03:35:18.807 --> 03:35:22.542
unlike any other program that
happens at the library and you

03:35:22.543 --> 03:35:25.073
might say it's a little louder
and some might describe it as

03:35:25.074 --> 03:35:30.721
being a little more chaotic. 
But late this summer, early this

03:35:30.722 --> 03:35:36.597
fall, I was over in our young
readers center and my colleague,

03:35:36.598 --> 03:35:40.512
Sasha Dowdy and intern at the
time, Erin Durham, a student at

03:35:40.513 --> 03:35:44.251
the University of Maryland, they
were practicing for the upcoming

03:35:44.252 --> 03:35:48.984
story time.  And, you know,
storytime always involves songs

03:35:48.985 --> 03:35:52.028
and there's always a little bit
of movement, but this was the

03:35:52.029 --> 03:35:56.066
first story time that we were
experimenting with bringing

03:35:56.469 --> 03:36:00.999
musical instruments into story
time.  And it was really quite

03:36:01.000 --> 03:36:04.527
something.  When you're used to
seeing a little bit of chaos and

03:36:04.528 --> 03:36:11.285
suddenly a violin is involved,
three-year-olds are mesmerized. 

03:36:11.286 --> 03:36:14.221
In fact, it would be fun to
mesmerize you guys for a little

03:36:14.222 --> 03:36:18.856
bit today and so I invited Sasha
and I invited Erin to come and

03:36:18.857 --> 03:36:21.671
share a little bit of musical
story time with you.

03:36:33.970 --> 03:36:39.677
&gt;&gt;  Hem low.
&gt;&gt;  Hello.  Thank you Lee Ann.

03:37:00.189 --> 03:37:03.619
&gt;&gt;  Mole lived all alone
underground.  He spent his days

03:37:03.620 --> 03:37:06.562
digging tunnels.
[ violin playing ]

03:37:06.584 --> 03:37:11.799
&gt;&gt;  At night he ate supper in
front of TV and went to bed.

03:37:11.821 --> 03:37:16.746
[ violin playing ]
&gt;&gt;  Mole liked that lately he

03:37:16.747 --> 03:37:19.684
had begun to feel there was
something missing.

03:37:19.707 --> 03:37:21.707
[ violin playing ]

03:37:23.705 --> 03:37:27.142
&gt;&gt;  One night on the television
the man played the violin.  He

03:37:27.143 --> 03:37:31.280
made the most beautiful music
Mole had ever heard.

03:37:31.303 --> 03:37:33.303
[ violin playing ]

03:37:41.169 --> 03:37:44.609
&gt;&gt;  I want to make beautiful
music, too, Mole said to

03:37:44.646 --> 03:37:48.529
himself.
&gt;&gt;  [ violin playing ]

03:37:48.552 --> 03:37:53.284
&gt;&gt;  So the next day he sent away
for a violin of his own.

03:37:53.308 --> 03:37:55.308
[ violin playing ]

03:37:57.110 --> 03:38:00.254
Every day Mole checked his
mailbox.

03:38:00.276 --> 03:38:03.087
[ violin playing ]
No violin.

03:38:06.198 --> 03:38:10.328
Finally, after nearly three
weeks, it arrived! 

03:38:10.354 --> 03:38:15.077
[ violin playing ]
Mole was so excited! 

03:38:15.099 --> 03:38:17.099
[ violin playing ]

03:38:19.218 --> 03:38:24.658
He picked up the violin and drew
the bow across the strings...

03:38:24.659 --> 03:38:28.204
[ violin playing ]
[ Laughter ]

03:38:28.227 --> 03:38:32.639
But instead of beautiful music
all he made was a horrible

03:38:32.643 --> 03:38:36.783
screeching sound.
[ violin playing ]

03:38:36.806 --> 03:38:40.908
Mole tried again.
The violin still screeched but

03:38:40.909 --> 03:38:46.766
not quite so horribly.
Mole kept at it.  After about a

03:38:46.767 --> 03:38:50.704
week he could play one note.
[ violin playing ]

03:38:50.726 --> 03:38:53.833
Then two.
[ violin playing ]

03:38:53.855 --> 03:38:59.377
And before a month went by, he
could play an entire scale.

03:38:59.400 --> 03:39:05.938

Mole continued to practice.  He

03:39:05.939 --> 03:39:09.880
learned to put the notes
together in a simple song.

03:39:09.904 --> 03:39:11.904
[ violin playing ]

03:39:14.408 --> 03:39:16.408
Years went by.

03:39:21.506 --> 03:39:24.701
  Mole got better
and better

03:39:24.724 --> 03:39:28.334
[ violin playing ]
He was happier than he had ever

03:39:28.335 --> 03:39:32.169
been.  During the day as he dug
tunnels, Mole hummed the music

03:39:32.170 --> 03:39:34.614
he would play at night.
[ violin playing ]

03:39:42.779 --> 03:39:45.296
Now Mole played even better than
the man he had seen on TV so

03:39:45.500 --> 03:39:47.500
long ago.
[ violin playing ]

03:39:54.765 --> 03:39:58.097
Sometimes he wondered what it
would be like to play his music

03:39:58.098 --> 03:40:01.535
for people.
[ violin playing ]

03:40:04.954 --> 03:40:09.494
He imagined himself playing
before a huge audience.

03:40:09.517 --> 03:40:11.517
[ violin playing ]

03:40:13.527 --> 03:40:17.180
He imagined that he played for
presidents and queens.

03:40:23.513 --> 03:40:27.653
He even imagined that his music
could reach into people's hearts

03:40:27.654 --> 03:40:31.700
and melt away their anger and
sadness.

03:40:31.723 --> 03:40:36.642
[ violin playing ]
Why, maybe his music could even

03:40:36.643 --> 03:40:38.643
change the world! 

03:40:41.372 --> 03:40:45.528
[ violin playing ]
Mole laughed at himself.

03:40:49.334 --> 03:40:53.485
How silly I am, he thought. 
Imagining that my music could do

03:40:53.486 --> 03:40:57.033
all that when no one has ever
even heard it.

03:40:57.056 --> 03:40:59.056
[ violin playing ]

03:41:04.418 --> 03:41:06.418
Mole played one more song.

03:41:09.014 --> 03:41:12.351
[ violin playing ]

03:41:21.515 --> 03:41:26.050
Then he put down his violin and
went to sleep.  And dreamed

03:41:26.542 --> 03:41:28.542
beautiful, peaceful dreams.

03:41:34.810 --> 03:41:36.841
[ violin playing ]
[Applause]

03:41:49.533 --> 03:41:52.067
&gt;&gt;  We still have three and a
half minutes for questions.

03:41:52.090 --> 03:41:57.399
You guys are fabulous.  That was
just great.  Don't you want to

03:41:57.400 --> 03:41:59.641
go to story time?
Okay!

03:41:59.663 --> 03:42:01.663
It does look like we have a
question over here.

03:42:04.782 --> 03:42:12.859
John has a mic for you.
&gt;&gt;  Hi! Thank you so very much. 

03:42:12.860 --> 03:42:19.514
This was a wonderful panel. 
Just a wonderful day really.  A

03:42:19.515 --> 03:42:22.544
question for you all.  This is a
question that we have been

03:42:22.846 --> 03:42:26.287
talking about as a community
very recently.  What does it

03:42:26.577 --> 03:42:29.002
mean to be a national
organization serving local

03:42:29.207 --> 03:42:32.034
audience?
Maybe some of you could

03:42:32.642 --> 03:42:36.888
illustrate a bit of how you're
working specifically with D.C.

03:42:36.889 --> 03:42:40.424
family engagement empowerment? 
You know, today's conversation

03:42:40.425 --> 03:42:44.143
about equity access and
empowerment, how are we or you

03:42:44.144 --> 03:42:47.687
as organizations empowering
young students and families to

03:42:47.688 --> 03:42:50.926
take full advantage and
incorporate the amazing

03:42:52.217 --> 03:42:55.854
amenities and offerings here
nationally to D.C.?

03:42:55.877 --> 03:42:59.890
&gt;&gt;  Great question.  And,
actually, I'm very happy that

03:42:59.891 --> 03:43:04.329
you asked it.  So story time
that happens here at the library

03:43:04.330 --> 03:43:07.968
is not something that we
livestream.  It's not something

03:43:07.969 --> 03:43:11.894
that we make a big deal out of. 
And like I said, one of the

03:43:12.300 --> 03:43:15.348
reasons why I wanted to invite
Sasha and Erin to do this for

03:43:15.349 --> 03:43:18.972
this particular event was to
really stretch the reach of that

03:43:18.973 --> 03:43:22.312
program, hoping that maybe
there's an opportunity for some

03:43:22.313 --> 03:43:28.144
milk minimumming to go on. --
milk minimumming to go on.  I

03:43:28.145 --> 03:43:31.592
know programs like that are
going on over the country, and

03:43:31.593 --> 03:43:34.420
we want to showcase some of
that.  We're being live streamed

03:43:34.421 --> 03:43:36.936
today and the opportunity to
extend the reach of the programs

03:43:36.937 --> 03:43:39.873
at the library by using those
technologies is one of the ways

03:43:39.874 --> 03:43:43.315
we're trying to do that.  But
the balance between figuring

03:43:43.810 --> 03:43:47.047
out, are you serving a local
audience or national audience,

03:43:47.048 --> 03:43:51.479
I'm not sure it's neither/or.  I
think it's a both/and.  I think

03:43:51.480 --> 03:43:54.108
there's an opportunity to
recognize that those local

03:43:54.912 --> 03:43:57.636
audiences, frankly we have a
team board here at the Library

03:43:57.637 --> 03:44:01.330
in our Young Readers Center, and
some of the students we're able

03:44:01.331 --> 03:44:04.250
to make available to those young
people, we're trying to figure

03:44:04.251 --> 03:44:09.296
out very deliberately, how do we
capture this and make this

03:44:09.392 --> 03:44:12.360
available to a much broader
audience, what we've done this

03:44:12.361 --> 03:44:14.848
year something sort of new with
that group is asking colleagues

03:44:14.849 --> 03:44:18.174
from around the library to come
to each one of their meetings

03:44:18.175 --> 03:44:20.409
and share with students some of
the resources that are in their

03:44:20.410 --> 03:44:23.643
collections, so that the kids
have a better sense of the

03:44:24.047 --> 03:44:26.575
enormity of the place.  And we
need to do that with a much

03:44:26.987 --> 03:44:31.126
broader audience.  Really it's
both.  It's both/and.

03:44:31.152 --> 03:44:34.151
&gt;&gt;  I would say in visitor
services we reach out quite a

03:44:34.152 --> 03:44:37.701
bit with a lot of our tours to
invite in the different school

03:44:37.702 --> 03:44:43.338
groups.  When we do specific
tours in the exhibitions, like

03:44:43.339 --> 03:44:46.575
when we have the Magna Carta
here, we reached out quite a bit

03:44:46.576 --> 03:44:50.518
to a lot of D.C. public schools
and invited them in and it was

03:44:50.519 --> 03:44:56.188
on a docent-led tour.  We do do
a lot.

03:44:56.212 --> 03:44:58.406
&gt;&gt;  A million and a half
visitors, they're coming from

03:44:58.407 --> 03:45:00.236
all over.
&gt;&gt;  And our tours are available

03:45:00.237 --> 03:45:02.855
to everyone.
&gt;&gt;  I guess one of the things I

03:45:02.856 --> 03:45:05.800
think about is, you know, again,
I based a lot of what I talked

03:45:05.801 --> 03:45:08.520
about today on the national
standards, and how the

03:45:11.531 --> 03:45:15.267
responding being built from
those through resources here,

03:45:15.268 --> 03:45:17.795
they can connect to students no
matter where.  Looking at things

03:45:17.796 --> 03:45:21.641
like that, we think about how
can teachers personalize it

03:45:21.940 --> 03:45:25.080
either to perhaps a culture of a
community if you're looking for

03:45:25.081 --> 03:45:29.405
specific musics, intercultural
types activities, too, how can

03:45:29.406 --> 03:45:32.453
the teacher take what we're
providing or the different

03:45:33.048 --> 03:45:35.064
processes that I mentioned and
make them a little more

03:45:35.371 --> 03:45:39.809
appropriate, perhaps, and,
again, by the levels.  Where do

03:45:39.810 --> 03:45:43.726
we bring parents in as visiting
artists, when they talk about

03:45:43.727 --> 03:45:47.894
music at home.  So I would
suggest they're meant to be

03:45:48.292 --> 03:45:51.123
interpreted very widely when
they were written, the standards

03:45:51.124 --> 03:45:54.968
that it was meant to reflect a
national look, which is hard to

03:45:54.969 --> 03:45:57.682
do in that document, isn't it,
because we look different from

03:45:57.683 --> 03:46:01.424
one state and locale to the
next.  But how do we go about

03:46:01.425 --> 03:46:03.425
personalizing them would be the
goal.

03:46:05.972 --> 03:46:13.323
&gt;&gt;  For us it's really that we
do attract educators across the

03:46:13.324 --> 03:46:16.064
country to programs summer
intensive that happen in July,

03:46:16.065 --> 03:46:19.390
but the guides are meant to
brought back to communities and

03:46:19.391 --> 03:46:21.407
the people that don't have the
opportunity to come study with

03:46:21.408 --> 03:46:25.441
us and what we hope to do is
encourage them not only to

03:46:27.049 --> 03:46:28.875
explore the Library of Congress
collection but find ways in

03:46:28.876 --> 03:46:31.804
their own communities, no matter
where you live there's a

03:46:32.003 --> 03:46:34.003
historical society or

03:46:35.639 --> 03:46:37.159
 there's a
cultural central museum and a

03:46:37.160 --> 03:46:40.891
lot of museums have materials
that -- what we find is that we

03:46:40.892 --> 03:46:45.653
tell people we're bringing
educators, they're so over the

03:46:45.654 --> 03:46:47.971
moon.  A lot of cultural
institutions don't know how to

03:46:47.972 --> 03:46:52.207
engage with educators, but they
have curriculum and methods,

03:46:52.402 --> 03:46:55.535
they don't know how to publicize
that, so we're encouraging

03:46:56.046 --> 03:46:58.357
educators across the country to
engage with the cultural

03:46:58.770 --> 03:47:00.770
institutions in their own
communities as well as using

03:47:00.792 --> 03:47:04.427
what we know is on the Library
of Congress website as a

03:47:04.625 --> 03:47:06.625
springboard to then replicate
that in their own communities.

03:47:09.521 --> 03:47:11.521
&gt;&gt;  Any other questions?

03:47:15.515 --> 03:47:20.260
All right, Rhona, it's us.  We
could give you tap dancing and,

03:47:20.261 --> 03:47:24.000
you know... and I'll start by
simply saying, thank you all. 

03:47:24.001 --> 03:47:26.627
Thank you all for coming today. 
Our hope is that the

03:47:27.431 --> 03:47:29.431
conversations will continue,
that some of you will stick

03:47:29.859 --> 03:47:32.078
around and have lunch over in
the cafeteria and visit with

03:47:32.285 --> 03:47:35.205
each other and trade cards and
come up with approaches that you

03:47:35.206 --> 03:47:37.931
might -- yeah, great! And there
is a question.  Yay! 

03:47:40.987 --> 03:47:46.705
&gt;&gt;  I heard you say that
cultural organizations are going

03:47:46.706 --> 03:47:49.839
to work with people and that you
will have some program or

03:47:50.046 --> 03:47:53.076
something to help with that
area.

03:47:53.099 --> 03:47:59.418
&gt;&gt;  Well, we don't have any
specific resources exactly to

03:47:59.419 --> 03:48:03.653
connect with crick -- with
cultural organizations.  What we

03:48:03.654 --> 03:48:08.094
have is a guide to find
materials that work with

03:48:08.391 --> 03:48:10.922
particular curricular areas, but
we have our website that has

03:48:11.332 --> 03:48:13.253
resources and lesson plans and
you can call and connect with

03:48:13.254 --> 03:48:16.890
the people that are on our team
that can actually give you some

03:48:16.891 --> 03:48:19.715
prompts and tell you how to walk
into a cultural organization and

03:48:19.716 --> 03:48:23.859
say, this is what my curriculum
is, whatever I'm teaching.  What

03:48:23.860 --> 03:48:28.199
do you have in your
collection -- and we give you

03:48:28.200 --> 03:48:30.513
tools to start with what is on
the Library of Congress

03:48:30.721 --> 03:48:33.051
collection so you know what is
there and you can say, well,

03:48:33.347 --> 03:48:35.781
what can my students look at
that might be relevant to our

03:48:35.782 --> 03:48:37.782
own community?

03:48:39.207 --> 03:48:43.737
&gt;&gt;  Can I add on to that? 
Sorry.

03:48:43.760 --> 03:48:47.873
[ speaker is off microphone ]
&gt;&gt;  I just wanted to add on to

03:48:47.874 --> 03:48:51.826
that.  Especially talking about
equity and access and how

03:48:53.630 --> 03:48:56.266
educators can benefit from all
of these tools but then take

03:48:56.472 --> 03:48:59.894
them down to the local level. 
The D.C. collaborative has been

03:48:59.895 --> 03:49:04.031
working with Nathan Diamond and
the D.C. Arts Team for some time

03:49:04.032 --> 03:49:07.780
to find ways how we in the
private sector, all the cultural

03:49:07.781 --> 03:49:12.315
institutions here in the
district serving D.C. students

03:49:12.316 --> 03:49:15.936
can make curricular connections
to that arts education framework

03:49:15.937 --> 03:49:22.583
Nathan was talking about.  So
D.C. has those numbers for

03:49:22.586 --> 03:49:25.124
student field trip program and
after school programming and out

03:49:25.125 --> 03:49:28.559
of school time programming that
they provide, are now looking at

03:49:28.560 --> 03:49:32.800
the -- for curricular alignment,
and we do professional

03:49:33.005 --> 03:49:35.627
development opportunities and I
would absolutely welcome a field

03:49:35.628 --> 03:49:40.061
trip for us to come up to
Philadelphia so that we can

03:49:40.264 --> 03:49:46.406
share that out with educators
here in the District.

03:49:46.433 --> 03:49:49.969
&gt;&gt;  Okay.  So once again, thank
you all for coming this morning.

03:49:52.787 --> 03:49:55.916
that you've started and the
conversations that you will

03:49:55.969 --> 03:50:00.949
continue.  I also want you to
say "yes, I will."

03:50:00.973 --> 03:50:04.891
Thank you.  Good suggestion. 
It's like Julia works here. 

03:50:05.091 --> 03:50:08.032
She's reminding me that after
lunch I ought to head over to

03:50:08.033 --> 03:50:12.471
the Thomas Jefferson Building,
you that you have it visualize,

03:50:12.472 --> 03:50:15.003
you should see it if you
haven't.  Good suggestion.  I

03:50:15.004 --> 03:50:17.848
also want to do a shout-out to
some of my colleagues that have

03:50:17.849 --> 03:50:21.363
been incredibly helpful in the
planning of the event and

03:50:21.974 --> 03:50:28.934
execution of the event today. 
Michael Appledorf or Vivian, and

03:50:28.935 --> 03:50:35.003
our teacher in residence, Matt
Poss and I know Dana Bell is

03:50:35.840 --> 03:50:38.024
around and Phoebe Coleman, thank
you all for being here and for

03:50:38.025 --> 03:50:40.449
all that you do to help
contribute to today.

03:50:40.474 --> 03:50:42.474
[Applause]

03:50:44.268 --> 03:50:51.251
Thank you Rhona.  My goal for
this was that everybody in the

03:50:51.252 --> 03:50:53.378
room would know a little more
about the Library of Congress

03:50:53.379 --> 03:50:56.405
than you knew when you got here
this morning and that you might

03:50:56.406 --> 03:50:59.529
start thinking of some ways that
your organization or that the

03:50:59.530 --> 03:51:03.169
teachers or students that you
work with might benefit from the

03:51:03.566 --> 03:51:06.297
Library and its collections in
ways you had never imagined

03:51:07.045 --> 03:51:09.030
before, and get to know us. 
Because we're a lot of fun and

03:51:09.031 --> 03:51:10.872
we've got some really cool
stuff.

03:51:10.873 --> 03:51:14.986
&gt;&gt;  They are fun.
&gt;&gt;  All right.  Very good.

03:51:15.008 --> 03:51:18.221
Deanna?
[ speaker is off microphone ]

03:51:18.222 --> 03:51:22.017
&gt;&gt;  And, yes, on your way out
you can snag a terrific

03:51:22.471 --> 03:51:27.316
publication called "Lyrical
Legacies" featuring amazing

03:51:27.512 --> 03:51:30.843
