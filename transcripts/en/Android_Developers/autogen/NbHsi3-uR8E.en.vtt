00:00:00.255 --> 00:00:01.659
 I am Dan Galpin. 

00:00:01.689 --> 00:00:04.060
 I am the promotion coordinator of Google Android developers. 

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:05.590
 Now is the Android tool time 

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:08.130
 We will introduce Android Studio 2.2 here. 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:13.910
 We previewed Android Studio 2.2 at the annual web developer conference held by Google this year. 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:16.640
 Showcase some new features and improvements 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.530
 During the preview and test phase 

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:20.240
 We listened to and tested your feedback. 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.650
 We are proud to announce that Android Studio 2.2 is now available. 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.760
 Can be downloaded on a stable channel 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.950
 Android Studio 2.2 has improvements in every stage of application creation - 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:31.280
 Including prototype design interface design 

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.930
 Code development and iteration 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.350
 Testing and fine tuning 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.260
 Let me take a look at these improvements with you. 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:39.930
 We modified the layout editor 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.910
 And added built-in support for restricted layouts 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:47.000
 Visually by specifying view position and boundaries on Android 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.830
 Build a new dynamic user interface 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:52.730
 Layout Editor adds blueprint mode and property panel 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.320
 Can be modified using the icon tool above 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.440
 So you don't have to go back to text mode. 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.440
 When you need to debug your UI 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:01.960
 We have a new layout detector 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.970
 Allows you to run on a device or emulator 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.720
 Capture snapshots of hierarchies and attributes 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.940
 We will continue to improve the code editor 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:11.860
 Further update the Lint check 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:13.640
 Resulting in better code analysis 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.430
 When you need to make sure the API is used correctly 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.210
 When asking for Android sample code 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.190
 You can also right click 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:21.450
 Search all examples on GitHub 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.570
 We have upgraded to IntelliJ 2016.1 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.610
 It adds a lot of features 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.520
 Such as left-to-right language support and method parameter reordering 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:32.630
 Because of Firebase integration 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.040
 You can now easily add Firebase services 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.410
 Such as analytics data cloud messages and crash reports in the app 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:41.620
 Includes initial project setup and adding dependencies 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.190
 We will provide convenient documentation links and code snippets 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:46.960
 You can add it to your app to get Firebase functionality. 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.626
 And can make it flow smoothly 

00:01:48.976 --> 00:01:52.280
 To better understand what happened during the consolidation of the list 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.140
 You can use now 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:54.630
 Merge list check viewer 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.130
 This will let you preview the list 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.213
 Because it will be in different colors 

00:01:58.213 --> 00:02:00.360
 Highlight other manifest files in the library 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.722
 Provided content 

00:02:02.722 --> 00:02:04.680
 When the developer wants to check what the APK does. 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.500
 We are in Android Studio 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.120
 Build a new APK Analyzer 

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:11.310
 Just open the app's APK 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.880
 You will be able to check each component 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.190
 Estimated downloads in the space occupied by the app 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.357
 Even taking into account the amount of compression that the Google Play Store has on the app. 

00:02:20.917 --> 00:02:23.160
 By comparing features relative to previous versions of the app 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.800
 You can easily analyze the size regression of the APK 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.530
 By going deep into classes.dex 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.660
 And check the contents of the source file 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.930
 You can also debug MultiDex issues 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.422
 Anyone who writes native code in the library will be excited 

00:02:36.422 --> 00:02:39.600
 Because we build systems with CMake and NDK 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.250
 Added support for C and C++ projects 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.850
 Now you can import the original project in Android Studio accurately. 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.510
 And use improved technology 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.570
 Edit and debug C and C++ code in the IDE 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.050
 For those who work directly with OpenGLES 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:56.950
 We joined the beta version of the GPU debugger 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.980
 It can record GL commands at runtime and allows you to replay in every frame 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.640
 After each instruction 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.530
 Thoroughly check the status of GL 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.530
 Includes buffer textures and grid content 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.150
 We are still adding some new features to the GPU debugger. 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.720
 And improve its speed and stability 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.330
 That's why we call it the beta 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.940
 In the Bug Tracker in the Android Studio Google+ Community 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.990
 Advising our new tools 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:21.490
 In this new version, 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:23.906
 We want developers to try to create new tools for UI testing -- 

00:03:23.906 --> 00:03:26.060
 Espresso test recorder 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.270
 Also a beta 

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:30.530
 Test recorder in the emulator 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.210
 Record your interactions with the app 

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:34.710
 And allows you to add assertions in a simple interface 

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:38.060
 The generated test is just a simple Java code that uses the Espresso library. 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:39.340
 Therefore, if there is a need in the future 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.260
 You can customize them 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.060
 Android Studio 2.2 is just right 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:46.600
 Update with SDK Tools 25.2.2 and Android Simulator 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:47.920
 Also released 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.340
 The emulator now lets you simulate several Android sensors in the emulator UI 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.660
 Accelerometer magnetometer 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:56.320
 Environmental thermometer, etc. 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.420
 Includes 3D devices that can be moved 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.070
 As always, the latest Android Studio 

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:04.240
 Also made internal improvements to other features 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:06.890
 For example, modify the build time for instant run 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:08.940
 Support for annotation processors in the Jack compiler, 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:10.720
 New app package code 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.590
 And better accessibility support in the IDE 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:16.570
 To make sure you can make the most of this version, 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.350
 Remember to update your project with the Android Gradle plugin 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:20.779
 So that you can use version 2.2.0 

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:22.490
 Using SDK Manager 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:24.760
 Update your build tools and emulator images 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.949
 Don't forget to enable instant running 

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:29.300
 I believe you will like Android Studio 2.2. 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.520
 Many new features and improvements in its stability 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.460
 As always we expect your feedback
