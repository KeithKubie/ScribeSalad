00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:07.460
Let's see if we can find
the cube root of 3,430.

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:10.680
And if you're like me, it
doesn't jump out of your mind

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.374
what number times that same
number times that same number--

00:00:13.374 --> 00:00:14.790
if you have three
of those numbers

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.456
and you were to
multiply them together--

00:00:16.456 --> 00:00:18.230
would be equal to 3,430.

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.050
So what I'm going to do is
to try to prime factorize

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.780
this to find all the
prime factors of 3,430

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:26.360
and see if any of
those prime factors

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:27.850
show up at least three times.

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:29.600
And that'll help us with this.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:35.930
So 3,430-- it's clearly
divisible by 5 and 2,

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:37.620
or it's divisible by 10.

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.090
So let's do that.

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.040
So first we can divide it by 2.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.560
It's 2 times-- let's see.

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:48.430
3,430 divided by 2 is 1,715.

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:50.820
Then we can divide
it by 5, as well.

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.072
We can factor 1,715
into 5 and-- let

00:00:55.072 --> 00:00:57.280
me do a little bit of long
division on the side here.

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:02.730
So if I have 1,715, and I'm
going to divide it by 5.

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.269
5 doesn't go into 1.

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:06.620
It goes into 17 three times.

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.790
3 times 5 is 15.

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:14.150
Subtract, you get 2, and
then you bring down a 1.

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.760
5 goes into 21 four times.

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.710
4 times 5 is 20.

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:20.090
Subtract.

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.770
Bring down the 5.

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.320
5 goes into 15 three times,
so it goes exactly 343 times.

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:34.470
So 1,715 can be factored
into 5 times 343.

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.940
Now, 343 might not
jump out at you

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:39.510
as a number that
is easy to factor.

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:43.040
It's clearly an odd number,
so it won't be divisible by 2.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.870
Its digits add up to 10,
which is not divisible by 3.

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:48.579
So this isn't going
to be divisible by 3.

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:50.078
It's not going to
be divisible by 4,

00:01:50.078 --> 00:01:51.760
because it's not divisible by 2.

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.860
It's not going to
be divisible by 5.

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.570
If it wasn't
divisible by 3 or 2,

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.780
it's not going to
be divisible by 6.

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.070
And now we get to 7.

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:02.700
Usually when you
see a nutty number

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.075
like this that
doesn't seem to be

00:02:04.075 --> 00:02:05.500
divisible by a lot
of things, it's

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.190
always a good idea to try
things like 7, 11, 13.

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.020
Because those tend to construct
very interesting numbers.

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.390
So let's see if this
is divisible by 7.

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:21.730
So if I take 343 and if
I want to divide it by 7,

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.370
7 goes into 30-- it doesn't
go into 3-- 7 goes into 34

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:27.520
four times.

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.800
4 times 7 is 28.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.970
Subtract, 34 minus 28 is 6.

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.690
Bring down a 3.

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.830
7 goes into 63 nine times.

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.800
9 times 7 is 63.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:40.914
Subtract.

00:02:40.914 --> 00:02:42.080
We don't have any remainder.

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.830
And I forgot to do
that last step up here.

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.470
3 times 15 is 15.

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:46.750
Subtract, no remainder.

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.110
It went in exactly.

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:53.480
So here, 343 can be
factored into 7 and 49.

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:59.510
And 49 might jump out at you.

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.502
It can be factored
into 7 times 7.

00:03:04.502 --> 00:03:05.460
So this is interesting.

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:09.560
I can rewrite all of this
here-- the cube root of 3,430--

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:15.160
now as the cube
root of-- I'm just

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.170
going to write it in its
factored form-- 2 times

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:22.280
5 times-- I could write
7 times 7 times 7,

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.450
or I could write times
7 to the third power.

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:29.320
That captures these three
7's right over here.

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.700
I have three 7's, and then
I'm multiplying them together.

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.660
So that's 7 to the third power.

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.050
And from our
exponent properties,

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:41.310
we know that this is the
exact same thing as the cube

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:50.850
root of 2 times 5 times
the cube root-- so

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:53.210
let me do that in
that same, just so we

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:55.180
see what colors
we're dealing with.

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:59.110
So the cube root of 2 times 5,
which is the cube root of 10,

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:03.470
times the cube
root-- and I think

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:09.340
you see where this is going--
of 7 to the third power.

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.510
Keeping track of the
colors is the hard part.

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:15.510
And the cube root of 10,
we just leave it as 10.

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.982
We know the prime factorization
of 10 is 2 times 5,

00:04:17.982 --> 00:04:20.190
so you're not going to just
get a very simple integer

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:20.689
answer here.

00:04:20.689 --> 00:04:22.340
You would get some
decimal answer here,

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.660
but here you get a very
clear integer answer.

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.850
The cube root of 7 to
the third, well, that's

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:27.940
just going to be 7.

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:29.780
So this is just going to be 7.

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:31.360
So our entire thing simplifies.

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:39.090
This is equal to 7 times
the cube root of 10.

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:40.700
And this is about
as simplified as we

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:42.650
can get just using
hand arithmetic.

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:46.120
If you want to get
the exact number here,

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.725
you're probably best
off using a calculator.
