00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:04.990
Remember that the circumference is the
length around the outside of a circle.

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:07.250
So that's this blue line here.

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.870
And the diameter is the length of a line
that passes through the center of

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.370
the circle and
whose endpoints lie on the circle.

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:18.470
So this line here.

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:21.500
You can also think about this
as the width of the circle.

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.430
This should not be
confused with the radius

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:29.600
which is the length of a line from the
center of the circle to the perimeter.

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:36.290
It's important to note that the radius
is half the length of the diameter or

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:40.260
the diameter is twice
the length of the radius.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.170
There is a relationship between
circumference and diameter.

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:46.060
Pi links them.

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:51.474
We can find the circumference C of any

00:00:51.474 --> 00:00:57.070
circle using C = Pi times diameter D.

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:02.827
Since diameter is
the same thing as twice

00:01:02.827 --> 00:01:09.440
the radius this can also
be written as c = 2 pi r
