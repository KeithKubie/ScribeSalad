00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:03.557
What is the area of this figure?

00:00:03.557 --> 00:00:05.390
And this figure right
over here is sometimes

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:07.225
called a kite for
obvious reasons.

00:00:07.225 --> 00:00:08.600
If you tied some
string here, you

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.054
might want to fly
it at the beach.

00:00:10.054 --> 00:00:11.970
And another way to think
about what a kite is,

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:20.900
it's a quadrilateral that is
symmetric around a diagonal.

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.350
So this right over here is the
diagonal of this quadrilateral.

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:25.910
And it's symmetric around it.

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:29.955
This top part and this bottom
part are mirror images.

00:00:29.955 --> 00:00:32.080
And to think about how we
might find the area of it

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.200
given that we've been
given essentially

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.770
the width of this
kite, and we've also

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.120
been given the
height of this kite,

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.090
or if you view this
as a sideways kite,

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:42.890
you could view this
is the height and that

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:44.950
the eight centimeters
as the width.

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:46.660
Given that we've got
those dimensions,

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.400
how can we actually
figure out its area?

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.570
So to do that, let
me actually copy

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:53.920
and paste half of the kite.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.180
So this is the bottom
half of the kite.

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:01.530
And then let's take the
top half of the kite

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.450
and split it up into sections.

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:06.560
So I have this little
red section here.

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.410
I have this red section here.

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:15.560
And actually, I'm going to try
to color the actual lines here

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.010
so that we can keep
track of those as well.

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:23.910
So I'll make this line green
and I'll make this line purple.

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:27.290
So imagine taking this little
triangle right over here--

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:31.020
and actually, let me do
this one too in blue.

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.630
So this one over here is blue.

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:35.510
You get the picture.

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:37.695
Let me try to color it
in at least reasonably.

00:01:37.695 --> 00:01:38.780
So I'll color it in.

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:44.620
And then I could make this
segment right over here,

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:46.840
I'm going to make orange.

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.540
So let's start focusing
on this red triangle here.

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:57.800
Imagine flipping it over and
then moving it down here.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.380
So what would it look like?

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:04.230
Well then the green side is
going to now be over here.

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:08.340
This kind of mauve colored
side is still on the bottom.

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.580
And my red triangle is going
to look something like this.

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.940
My red triangle is
going to look like that.

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.090
Now let's do the same thing
with this bigger blue triangle.

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.750
Let's flip it over and
then move it down here.

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:28.050
So this green side, since we've
flipped it, is now over here.

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.615
And this orange side
is now over here.

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:42.680
And we have this
blue right over here.

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.160
And the reason that we know
that it definitely fits

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.360
is the fact that it is
symmetric around this diagonal,

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.560
that this length
right over here is

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.420
equivalent to this
length right over here.

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.220
That's why it fits
perfectly like this.

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.510
Now, what we just
constructed is clearly

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:06.800
a rectangle, a rectangle that
is 14 centimeters wide and not

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.490
8 centimeters high, it's
half of 8 centimeters high.

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:14.890
So it's 8 centimeters times
1/2 or 4 centimeters high.

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.030
And we know how to
find the area of this.

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.490
This is 4 centimeters
times 14 centimeters.

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:25.460
So the area is equal
to 4 centimeters

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:30.240
times 14 centimeters which
is equal to-- let's see,

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:35.640
that's 40 plus 16--
56 square centimeters.

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.590
So if you're taking
the area of a kite,

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.370
you're really just
taking 1/2 the width

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.410
times the height, or 1/2
the width times the height,

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:48.540
any way you want
to think about it.
