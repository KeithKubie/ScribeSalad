- [Voiceover] Five thousands
equals how many hundreds?

00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:06.147
There's probably a few
ways we could take this on,

00:00:06.147 --> 00:00:07.129
but maybe let's start

00:00:07.129 --> 00:00:10.269
by thinking about these five thousands.

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:13.269
Five thousands is 1,000, five times.

00:00:16.436 --> 00:00:18.751
So let's think about
each of those thousands,

00:00:18.751 --> 00:00:21.103
each of those five thousands.

00:00:21.103 --> 00:00:24.520
In 1,000, how many hundreds are in 1,000?

00:00:26.358 --> 00:00:28.941
1,000 equals how many hundreds?

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.226
Well let's see, let's count by hundreds

00:00:32.226 --> 00:00:33.966
until we get to 1,000,

00:00:33.966 --> 00:00:35.346
and I'll keep a little tally mark

00:00:35.346 --> 00:00:37.542
so we can keep count of how
many hundreds it takes us

00:00:37.542 --> 00:00:38.875
to get to 1,000.

00:00:40.158 --> 00:00:42.158
100, 200, 300, 400, 500,

00:00:44.346 --> 00:00:46.513
600, 700, 800, 900, 1,000.

00:00:49.134 --> 00:00:53.262
So it took 10 hundreds, to get to 1,000.

00:00:53.262 --> 00:00:55.262
So 1,000 is 10 hundreds.

00:00:57.008 --> 00:00:58.925
So what would 5,000 be?

00:01:01.473 --> 00:01:04.640
5,000 is five times as many thousands.

00:01:06.834 --> 00:01:11.001
So we're also gonna have
five times as many hundreds.

00:01:11.842 --> 00:01:13.259
So five thousands

00:01:15.131 --> 00:01:17.964
will equal five times 10 hundreds,

00:01:21.035 --> 00:01:23.282
because we have 5,000 this time,

00:01:23.282 --> 00:01:26.115
so we have five times 10 hundreds,

00:01:29.596 --> 00:01:31.138
or five times 10.

00:01:31.138 --> 00:01:32.805
Five times 10 is 50.

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:37.082
So 5,000 equals 50 hundreds.

00:01:41.698 --> 00:01:44.157
Another way we could think
about this is place value,

00:01:44.157 --> 00:01:45.310
so let's do that.

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.143
Let's look at a place value chart.

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:50.422
Here we have a place value chart

00:01:50.422 --> 00:01:53.589
and if we fill in five under thousands

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:59.158
we can see that we have
three empty spaces.

00:01:59.158 --> 00:02:02.157
We have no hundreds, no tens and no ones,

00:02:02.157 --> 00:02:05.407
So we need to fill those in with zeros,

00:02:06.947 --> 00:02:07.780
or 5,000.

00:02:09.083 --> 00:02:11.029
Again, it's 5,000.

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:15.456
Writing the word thousands
essentially replaced

00:02:15.456 --> 00:02:16.501
those three zeros.

00:02:16.501 --> 00:02:19.500
Five thousands is the same as five

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.871
with three zeros behind it,

00:02:21.871 --> 00:02:24.691
and now we want to change
these five thousands

00:02:24.691 --> 00:02:25.941
to be hundreds.

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:28.724
Well when we read this place value chart,

00:02:28.724 --> 00:02:31.087
when we read five, when we stopped here,

00:02:31.087 --> 00:02:33.366
five is the last number we read

00:02:33.366 --> 00:02:37.052
and then we read the place
value above it, thousands.

00:02:37.052 --> 00:02:38.875
So for hundreds we'll do the same thing

00:02:38.875 --> 00:02:40.317
up until the hundreds.

00:02:40.317 --> 00:02:41.587
We'll read the place value chart

00:02:41.587 --> 00:02:44.203
until the place value we want

00:02:44.203 --> 00:02:46.161
and then the place value.

00:02:46.161 --> 00:02:49.911
So five thousands is
the same as 50 hundreds.

00:02:52.316 --> 00:02:55.566
Five thousands is equal to 50 hundreds,

00:02:58.858 --> 00:03:02.398
and we don't have to include
these last zeros on the end

00:03:02.398 --> 00:03:06.729
because just like thousands
implied three zeros,

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:08.932
hundreds, by saying hundreds

00:03:08.932 --> 00:03:13.156
we've essentially implied
that these zeros are there.

00:03:13.156 --> 00:03:16.656
So five thousands is equal to 50 hundreds.

00:03:17.828 --> 00:03:19.121
We weren't asked about tens

00:03:19.121 --> 00:03:22.192
but we could look here
and figure it out, I bet.

00:03:22.192 --> 00:03:24.609
Tens I would say, is 500 10s.

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:28.976
We'd read up through the
tens and then the tens place

00:03:28.976 --> 00:03:31.893
because 10s have one zero after them.

00:03:31.893 --> 00:03:35.108
That zero is implied when you say 10,

00:03:35.108 --> 00:03:38.072
and then finally, if we
went all the way to the end,

00:03:38.072 --> 00:03:42.239
we could also say that this
number is equal to 5,000 ones.

00:03:45.032 --> 00:03:47.944
So any of those, five thousands,

00:03:47.944 --> 00:03:52.635
50 hundreds, 500 tens or
5,000 ones, are equivalent.

00:03:52.635 --> 00:03:55.048
They're all equal to each other,

00:03:55.048 --> 00:03:57.484
but the one we were
asked about was hundreds.

00:03:57.484 --> 00:04:00.484
So five thousands equal 50 hundreds.

00:04:03.207 --> 00:04:04.252
Here's another one.

00:04:04.252 --> 00:04:07.346
30 tens equals how many hundreds?

00:04:07.346 --> 00:04:11.564
So this time we're looking
at tens and hundreds.

00:04:11.564 --> 00:04:15.124
So let's think about how
tens and hundreds relate.

00:04:15.124 --> 00:04:16.207
How many tens

00:04:18.892 --> 00:04:20.523
are in 100?

00:04:20.523 --> 00:04:24.298
How many tens are in 100 and
we could write one hundred,

00:04:24.298 --> 00:04:26.798
the word or the number in 100.

00:04:29.338 --> 00:04:31.534
Well to figure that out
if we don't know already,

00:04:31.534 --> 00:04:32.589
we can count tens.

00:04:32.589 --> 00:04:35.243
We can count by 10s and see
how many 10s it takes us

00:04:35.243 --> 00:04:37.330
to get to a hundred.

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.747
One ten is 10, 20, 30, 40, 50

00:04:42.411 --> 00:04:44.078
60, 70, 80, 90, 100.

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:50.066
So we got to a hundred
and it took us 10 tens.

00:04:50.066 --> 00:04:52.149
There are 10 tens in 100.

00:04:53.788 --> 00:04:56.121
So if there's 10 tens in 100

00:04:57.338 --> 00:05:00.088
how many hundreds are in 30 tens?

00:05:01.155 --> 00:05:04.430
Well to get from 10 tens to 30 tens,

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:07.358
that's three times as many tens,

00:05:07.358 --> 00:05:11.846
so we'll also have three
times as many hundreds,

00:05:11.846 --> 00:05:13.346
or three hundreds.

00:05:15.026 --> 00:05:17.776
30 tens is three sets of 10 tens.

00:05:20.198 --> 00:05:22.130
10 tens are a hundred.

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:24.806
So another way to think of that is 30 tens

00:05:24.806 --> 00:05:28.556
is three sets of hundreds,
or three hundreds.

00:05:29.537 --> 00:05:32.984
We could also think about
this in terms of place value.

00:05:32.984 --> 00:05:35.303
Here we have this tens

00:05:35.303 --> 00:05:39.033
and we know that tens can
be represented by a zero.

00:05:39.033 --> 00:05:43.645
So instead of 30 10s, we
could simply write a 30

00:05:43.645 --> 00:05:47.963
with a zero on the end,
that zero for tens,

00:05:47.963 --> 00:05:52.440
and then over here, equal
to, we have hundreds

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:56.268
and hundreds can be
represented by two zeros.

00:05:56.268 --> 00:05:58.248
So to make these equivalent,

00:05:58.248 --> 00:06:00.851
what number will need
to fill in this spot?

00:06:00.851 --> 00:06:05.018
And the answer again, is a three
like we already saw up top.

00:06:06.191 --> 00:06:09.274
So 30 10s is equal to three hundreds.
