00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.332
Here we can see that the waves with the long wavelengths are what we perceive

00:00:04.332 --> 00:00:09.697
as red, and this wavelength be about 750 nanometers. The shortest wavelength

00:00:09.697 --> 00:00:13.935
that we can perceive corresponds to violet light. And it's about 400

00:00:13.935 --> 00:00:22.160
nanometers. Just longer than violet, is blue and then green, yellow and orange.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.976
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So, when we perceive color our eyes are just taking in different wave lengths

00:00:24.976 --> 00:00:26.185
of light?

00:00:26.185 --> 00:00:29.820
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Exactly, and this is where color vision comes in. We talked before about how at

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.700
the back of our eyes we have these different photoreceptors, the rods and the

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:33.927
cones.

00:00:33.927 --> 00:00:35.610
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And the cones are the ones for color.

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.326
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Right, and we have three of them.

00:00:38.326 --> 00:00:39.026
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Why do we have three?

00:00:39.026 --> 00:00:42.731
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well, I think I mentioned this before, that ones for long wavelengths, red and

00:00:42.731 --> 00:00:47.181
oranges. Another type of cones is for these medium wavelengths, these greens

00:00:47.181 --> 00:00:51.944
and yellows. And still another is for the short wavelengths. And in fact, the

00:00:51.944 --> 00:00:54.968
most common type of color blindness, actually makes it hard to distinguish

00:00:54.968 --> 00:00:56.919
between reds and greens.
