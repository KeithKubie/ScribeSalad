&gt;&gt; Hi, YouTube.
I'm Rajesh Shah.

00:00:03.909 --> 00:00:11.150
I'm from India and I'm here at the Davos program.
I had been attending a number of sessions

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:17.250
which I related to how to
become to this past as far as my nations are

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.740
concerned in the economy.
And to me it's really fascinating that we

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:28.130
have a well-off, incredibly
intelligent and important people.

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:33.130
How do they allow trillions and trillions
of dollars to be wiped out.

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:36.880
And I went to one session yesterday and key
thing that seems to be

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.820
coming out of this date, the kind of completely
ignoring the lessons of

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:48.280
history and what happens when greed is allowed
to go completely a mock

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:54.230
as across and the kind of bonuses given to
people to sell junk.

00:00:54.230 --> 00:01:00.350
There are many many angry opponents but just
to think we have so many

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:06.409
people educated so expensively and with so
much experience, Nobel Prize

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:10.950
winners, they worked together could not get
this avoided.

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.420
This whole problem. They must have seen whether
we are going to have

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.259
growth, 1 percent or 2 percent in the world
but it looks like a very

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:26.770
difficult time at least next five or ten years.
Thank you.
