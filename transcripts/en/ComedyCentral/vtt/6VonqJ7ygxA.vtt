00:00:01.268 --> 00:00:02.870
- WOODY, I HAVE THE RESULTS
OF YOUR COLONOSCOPY.

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.806
- BE HONEST, DOC.
DO I HAVE THE ASS CANCER?

00:00:05.906 --> 00:00:08.041
- I'M NOT GOING TO SUGARCOAT IT,
WOODY.

00:00:08.141 --> 00:00:09.977
I FOUND SOMETHING ALARMING
IN THERE.

00:00:10.077 --> 00:00:12.412
- NO!
[alarm clock ringing]

00:00:12.513 --> 00:00:14.915
OH, YEAH, I ACCIDENTALLY
SAT ON THAT.

00:00:15.015 --> 00:00:16.683
- REALLY?
THESE TOO?

00:00:16.783 --> 00:00:18.652
LOOKS LIKE SOMEBODY FELL
ASS-FIRST INTO A YARD SALE.

00:00:18.752 --> 00:00:22.923
- I JUST LIKE TO BE ORGANIZED.
I CALL IT BUNG-SHUI.

00:00:23.023 --> 00:00:25.726
- BESIDES SOME MILD TEARING AND
WHAT I SWEAR WAS AN OOMPA LOOMPA

00:00:25.826 --> 00:00:27.794
THAT I WAS NEVER QUITE ABLE TO
GET A HOLD OF, YOU'RE ALL CLEAR.

00:00:27.895 --> 00:00:30.030
- GREAT.
NOW, IF YOU'LL KINDLY

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.366
RETURN THOSE THINGS TO MY ASS,
I'LL BE ON MY WAY.

00:00:32.466 --> 00:00:33.734
- OH, WOODY, YOU'RE STILL
UNDER THE INFLUENCE

00:00:33.834 --> 00:00:34.968
OF THE ANESTHETIC.

00:00:35.068 --> 00:00:36.470
I CAN'T LET YOU DRIVE
YOURSELF HOME.

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.172
- I GAVE YOU A BUNCH
OF EMERGENCY CONTACTS.

00:00:38.272 --> 00:00:39.239
DIDN'T YOU CALL 'EM?

00:00:39.339 --> 00:00:41.208
- YES.
I GOT FOUR WRONG NUMBERS,

00:00:41.308 --> 00:00:42.876
THREE HANG-UPS,
AND A "[bleep] MY MOTHER."

00:00:42.976 --> 00:00:44.978
SHE'S BEEN DEAD FOR THREE YEARS,
SO THAT WOULD BE DIFFICULT,

00:00:45.078 --> 00:00:46.513
BUT NOT IMPOSSIBLE.

00:00:46.613 --> 00:00:48.448
- OKAY.
SO WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:50.317
- MEDICALLY SPEAKING?
WELL, YOU HAVE NO FRIENDS.

00:00:50.417 --> 00:00:52.352
AND SINCE THERE'S NO ONE HERE
TO PICK YOU UP,

00:00:52.452 --> 00:00:53.320
I'M GOING TO HAVE
TO PUT YOU DOWN.

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.689
- WAIT, WAIT!
CAN'T I JUST CALL A CAB?

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:57.324
- HMM, I NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT.

00:00:57.424 --> 00:00:57.891
GUESS I DIDN'T NEED
TO PUT ALL THOSE PEOPLE DOWN

00:00:57.991 --> 00:00:59.960
AFTER ALL.

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:01.395
BOY, IS MY FACE RED.

00:01:01.495 --> 00:01:03.197
KIDDING!
I CAN'T FEEL EMOTION.

00:01:03.297 --> 00:01:04.898
- GET ME OUT OF HERE!

00:01:04.998 --> 00:01:07.100
- TOMMY!
SHUT UP AND PLAY YOUR TROMBONE!

00:01:07.201 --> 00:01:07.734
[sad trombone plays]
