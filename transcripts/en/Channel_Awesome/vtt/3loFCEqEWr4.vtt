00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:09.059
While "A Bug's Life" was a success,

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:15.119
it didn't quite bring in the numbers that "Toy Story" did, and even the critical reaction to it, seemed to be kind of mixed.

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:21.539
So, Pixar went back to the drawing board with "Toy Story 2"! I don't think people really knew what to expect with this.

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:27.479
I mean, it's a sequel to a film they really, really liked. And seeing how this was a new production studio,

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.660
we didn't know, could they do sequels? Could they do follow-ups?

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.329
Well, a lot of sequels are usually not as good as the first one,

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:34.860
so people are kind of nervous,

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.599
but at the same time, they were excited to see their favorite characters again. And from my standpoint,

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.420
"Toy Story 2" was not only as good as the original, I think it's even better.

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.460
Okay, what's the story? Woody and Buzz are back again.

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.500
But this time, Woody is in a bit of a predicament:

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:55.980
A garage sale is going on and sadly one of the older toys is being sold off. Woody goes in to save him,

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.160
but inevitably gets stolen by a nasty toy store owner.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:05.729
Because, we figure out that Woody is actually a very rare toy. In fact, he used to actually be part of a TV show.

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:06.600
That's right,

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:13.160
Woody's a collector's item, and he's not the only one. He also comes across a cowgirl named Jessie, a horse named Bullseye,

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:18.360
and a miner named The Prospector. The race is on for the rest of Woody's friends to go out and save him,

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:25.560
but it seems like Woody may have second thoughts about returning back home. Because he knows that eventually he has to face the inevitable:

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.860
That Andy will grow up and some day forget about him. He has another choice where he can be taken to a museum

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.220
where he can be enjoyed by children forever.

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.100
People would come from all over the world just to see that he exists.

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.260
And it's great writing like this that, once again, makes "Toy Story" great.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:47.159
Yes, there is kind of a villain in this movie with the toy store owner,

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.739
and, yes, even another one that's eventually revealed, but again, their motivations are understandable.

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.960
It's just the fact that they want to force their point of views on other people that ultimately make them, kind of, bad guys.

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:03.160
But the dilemma that Woody has to go through, is actually a good dilemma. In fact,

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:08.680
you're kind of siding with him going to the museum. Heck, some of these toys even have backstories.

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:12.180
Jessie's backstory is one of the emotional highlights of the entire film.

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.780
But to balance it out, she's not just a sad stick in the mud, she's a very fun active character, as well.

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:23.140
In fact, all of the new characters are. We have a Mrs. Potato Head, the Evil Emperor Zurg,

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.420
another Buzz Lightyear that goes through the exact same motions as the first one,

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:33.680
and look, even Barbie makes an appearance in this! How cool is that that the marketing team that brought us Barbie,

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.300
something so controlled and so protective of their identity,

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:42.900
actually allowed them to kind of make fun of their brand? As I said before, I'm not a huge Randy Newman fan,

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:48.500
but you know what? The song in here, is a good song, probably one of his best, in fact.

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.980
I'll admit, it's very well done. The CG on the people has gotten better, too.

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.840
I mean true, they don't look like actual people, but the textures are better, and yeah,

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:03.860
even a lot of the facial expressions seemed to work pretty well. The dramatic moments are very strong. They're never out of place,

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:09.520
they're very emotionally satisfying and you relate with every single aspect of it.

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:14.960
You relate with dealing with the inevitable, what will ultimately happen in the end. What should you do?

00:03:14.969 --> 00:03:18.809
What's the better thing for yourself and for others? What's the selfish thing?

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:23.060
What's the unselfish thing? All this stuff plays in and it's very,

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:29.459
very smart and very, very well done! Just when you think something like "Toy Story" couldn't possibly get any better,

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:34.240
they surprised us with this very well told, well written, well developed,

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:41.759
interesting CONTINUTION of a story, not a rehash. It's clever, it's funny, it's dramatic, it's visually interesting,

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:48.720
it's musically interesting, the characters are wonderful. I've gone on about it long enough. See it, if you haven't, already.
