00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.139
What’s growing in your vagina?

00:00:02.139 --> 00:00:05.319
no it’s probably not teeth.

00:00:05.319 --> 00:00:10.810
Hey guys, Julia here for Dnews

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:14.400
We’ve talked before about the microbiome
inside of us here on DNews before.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.019
From how our guts affect our moods to poop
transplants.

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:20.689
But did you know the vagina is it’s own
healthy balanced ecosystem?

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:21.800
That’s right, ladies.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.980
You’ve got an entire ecosystem between your
legs.

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.770
First off some studies indicate that YOU DON’T
NEED DOUCHES.

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:29.770
PLEASE STOP.

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:35.740
I know a lot of you do it, an estimated 20%
to 40% of American women between ages 15 and

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:37.950
44 say they use a vaginal douche.

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.820
Unfortunately, douching might actually mess
up this down under dynamic community.

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.510
Your vagina is cleaning itself.

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.050
It’s supposed to smell like vagina, not
like roses or peaches or whatever.

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:49.510
So what does a healthy vagina look like?

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.370
Well there might not be one type of “healthy”
vagina.. there’s natural variation in the

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.470
fauna of the female bits.

00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:00.211
Researchers used to think vaginas dominated
by bacteria Lactobacilius are the healthiest,

00:01:00.211 --> 00:01:03.990
but some studies suggest there’s at least
5 types of bacterial communities that like

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:04.990
lady parts.

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:08.970
These colonies vary in people from different
ethnicities and from person to person and

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.210
even week to week in the same person.

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.571
Some researchers from the University of Maryland
even think it’s the fluctuation of bacteria

00:01:15.571 --> 00:01:16.860
that signal a healthy vagina.

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.500
We’ve got a pretty cozy relationship with
these bacteria.

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.220
We provide them a warm and moist place to
grow and they provide us with protection.

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.810
No only to they colonize the space to squeeze
out any unwanted inhabitants, but they produce

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:35.530
lactic acid which helps keep the vagina very
strongly acidic, with a pH around 4.5 —similar

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:36.530
to beer.

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.820
This keeps out infections and makes it harder
for other nasty things to grow.

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:44.020
Some studies suggest that vaginal bacteria
is important for babies’ immune system.

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.270
As a baby moves through the birth canal during
childbirth, it picks up some of mom’s bacteria.

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.430
A study published in the Proceeds of the National
Academy of Sciences show that babies born

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.270
from C-Sections are actually missing certain
crucial bacteria.

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.150
Missing this first colonization of bacteria
from mom, means their immune systems don’t

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:04.620
get a chance to learn god bacteria from bad,
and could leave the infants with an increased

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:07.690
risk of immune disorders like asthma and food
allergies.

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:09.860
But this ecosystem can get out of balance.

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.510
Just like when the gut’s ecosystem gets
out of balance, people can get ulcerative

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.830
colitis, people with vaginas can get bacterial
vaginosis.

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.920
bacterial vaginosis is relatively common condition,
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.300
(CDC) says in fact, it’s the most common
vaginal infection.

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.480
It’s basically when the microbiome gets
a little out of whack.

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.000
Research from the Washington University School
of Medicine in St. Louis showed a bacteria

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.060
called Gardnerella vaginalis, is likely the
cause.

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.350
It leads to a shedding of cells in the vaginal
wall, exposing sensitive underlying tissue,

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:40.239
leaving some women vulnerable to STIs and
UTI.

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:45.070
But it’s easier to study something when
stuff goes wrong, and researchers are still

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:48.330
unsure about what a “right” vaginal microbiome
looks like.

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.440
Like we say on DNews, more research is clearly
needed.

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.989
so hold off on trying new things, like douches
or peach scented stuff, your nether regions

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:59.030
are probably normal and fine so chill out.

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:00.030
mk?

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.270
Switching gears for a second, we are really
happy that our new channel Seeker launched

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:04.270
this week!

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:07.540
Here on DNews, we take a look at the news
from a science angle, and they take a look

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.350
at the news from a human side.

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:20.430
Like this video here explaining why Egypt
is destroying one of the oldest cities on

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:26.400
Earth

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.900
So make sure you check that video out, it’s
the first link in the description, and subscribe

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:34.690
Alright, so got any other weird body questions?

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:35.739
Let us know in the comments below.

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:40.080
