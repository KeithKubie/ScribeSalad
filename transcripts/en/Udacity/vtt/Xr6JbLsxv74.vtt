00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:01.080
Well, let's see.

00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:01.790
To solve this one,

00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:06.470
let me first copy my equation over
here to give myself some room to work.

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:10.540
Now, to get the x-intercept,
I'm going to set the y value to zero,

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:12.920
and then solve for x.

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:18.640
So 3x- 2 times 0 = 12,
which means 3x = 12.

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.494
I can divide both sides by 3.

00:00:20.494 --> 00:00:22.039
And x = 4.

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:24.744
So the x-intercept is (4,0).

00:00:24.744 --> 00:00:27.670
For the y-intercept,
again I copy my equation down.

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:31.740
And now the y-intercept, I'm going to
be looking for an x value of zero.

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.370
So 3 times 0- 2y = 12.

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.000
3 times 0 is 0,
which just leaves me with negative 2y,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.100
don't forget the negative, equals 12.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.971
Divide both sides by negative 2, and

00:00:43.971 --> 00:00:49.008
I find that y = 12 divided by
negative 2, becomes negative 6.

00:00:49.008 --> 00:00:53.861
So, the y-intercept is (0,-6).
