00:00:03.792 --> 00:00:08.050
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:09.300
SYDNEY FINKELSTEIN: Thank you.

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:09.966
Thanks, Heather.

00:00:09.966 --> 00:00:10.910
Hi, everyone.

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:12.140
Thanks for having me here.

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:14.240
It's good to have
a chance to share

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.106
some ideas around superbosses.

00:00:16.106 --> 00:00:17.480
And I'm really
interested in what

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:18.550
you have to say about that.

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:20.758
And I'm going to have some
questions for you as well.

00:00:20.758 --> 00:00:22.710
A professor can't help
that type of stuff.

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.840
So let's start
with-- I'm a foodie.

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.590
I'm really into
great restaurants.

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.965
That's why I live in Hanover,
New Hampshire, for example.

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:37.920
And one of the things I noticed
in the early days of getting

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.800
interested a little
bit about talent

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.640
is I heard about this woman
that, after graduating

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.300
from college, she
went to France.

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.380
And she lived the Paris--
the Parisian lifestyle.

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:47.380
She went to the markets.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:51.540
She always had fresh food,
organic food, sustainable,

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.425
farm to table,
all the rest of it

00:00:54.425 --> 00:00:55.800
that comes from
the local markets

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.240
that Europe has been
far ahead of America on.

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:00.340
And she comes back to
America after a few years.

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.930
And she says, I want to
create a restaurant that

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.330
will be a platform
to tell America,

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.150
to help America
understand how to eat

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.340
better, how to eat
good food-- again,

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.160
natural ingredients, organic,
local sourcing, supporting

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.140
local farmers,
very high quality.

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.380
And she opened up a
restaurant in Oakland,

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.850
in Berkeley, by the
name of Chez Panisse.

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:21.580
And some of you will
know who this is.

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.800
It's Alice Waters,
legendary chef,

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.670
who, along with being this
innovator when it comes

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.726
to food, also has, over
the course of her career--

00:01:32.726 --> 00:01:34.350
and I'll say so far
because she's still

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.050
going strong-- has spawned
literally over 200 people.

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:41.050
Over 200 people that have
worked for her at some

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.239
stage in their careers have
gone on to tremendous success

00:01:44.239 --> 00:01:45.780
in their own right,
either opening up

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.130
their own restaurants,
maybe going

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.410
into the bakery business,
the cheese business,

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:54.570
running restaurants, being in
venture capital and finance

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.007
around the food industry--
a tremendous track record.

00:01:58.007 --> 00:01:59.590
And I said, wow,
here's somebody who's

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.670
really kind of
interesting, kind of cool--

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.710
and what she has
been able to do.

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.960
After a long period of
studying a lot of companies

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.126
and doing a lot of work
with a lot of organizations,

00:02:09.126 --> 00:02:11.870
I came to realize-- at least in
my mind, is-- I'm going to say,

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.420
the single most important
thing for any organization

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.480
to survive and thrive
in the long term,

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.840
and that is the ability to
generate and regenerate talent

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:21.920
on a continuous basis.

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:22.870
That's what she did.

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.120
So I found somebody like that.

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.240
And I said, this
is kind of cool.

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:26.864
Let me see if I can
find somebody else.

00:02:26.864 --> 00:02:29.600
And I decided, let's look at a
completely different industry.

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.370
And I looked at professional
football-- the NFL.

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.760
And it turns out that
when you look at the NFL,

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.690
there's one head coach that
has had an outsized influence

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.390
in the development
of other head coaches

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:42.806
throughout the
history of the NFL.

00:02:42.806 --> 00:02:44.960
Does anyone know
who that might be?

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:45.575
Any guesses?

00:02:45.575 --> 00:02:46.450
AUDIENCE: Bill Walsh.

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:47.260
SYDNEY FINKELSTEIN:
Bill Walsh, right.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.210
Bill Walsh, San Francisco 49ers.

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:52.340
In fact, one of the nice things
about professional football

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:53.860
and sports is a lot of data.

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:55.390
So I actually could
quantify this.

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:59.050
And so what I did is I looked
at all of the Super Bowl head

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:02.120
coaches of the winning
team and the losing team,

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.820
so the two best head coaches
in a particular year.

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:07.320
And I did a genealogical
study of them.

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.140
And by that, I mean,
not their parents,

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:10.500
but who they worked for.

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.750
And I created these
trees of talent.

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.346
And when I did
that, it turned out

00:03:14.346 --> 00:03:16.720
that Bill Walsh was far and
away ahead of everybody else.

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.428
Number two, by the
way-- we're in Boston,

00:03:18.428 --> 00:03:20.470
so I can tell you--
it's Bill Parcells.

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.370
And the reason is because
he has one protege that

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.260
is in the Super Bowl
almost every year.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.490
And that's Bill Belichick.

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:31.930
And so actually this past year,
back in February in the Super

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:36.180
Bowl, the two head coaches
both came from the Bill Walsh

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:37.210
tree of talent.

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:40.340
This is, by the way,
10 years after he died

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.440
and 20 years after
he was a head coach.

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.190
I mean, unbelievable legacy.

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.020
So I found somebody
in football, pretty

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:50.210
different from
high-end restaurants.

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:51.670
And I thought, OK, this is fun.

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:52.490
Let's keep going.

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:54.576
And then I decided, let's
look at hedge funds.

00:03:54.576 --> 00:03:55.700
There's no connection here.

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:57.900
They're just out of the blue.

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.180
And hedge funds, turns
out it's Julian Robertson

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:01.200
from Tiger Management.

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.090
Some of you who
know that industry

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:03.940
might know-- Tiger
Cubs, Tiger Seeds.

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:06.260
A tremendous number of
people who work for Julian

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.240
have become very successful
in the hedge fund business.

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:11.884
And it turns out to be actually
pretty easy to find that.

00:04:11.884 --> 00:04:13.050
You start talking to people.

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.906
And you ask them.

00:04:13.906 --> 00:04:15.780
And everyone keeps
telling you the same name.

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:17.910
And at some point, you
realize you found the guy

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:19.029
or you found the woman.

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:20.130
And so I kept going.

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:22.510
And I ended up looking
at Ralph Lauren

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:24.332
in fashion-- American fashion.

00:04:24.332 --> 00:04:26.040
The people that work
for Ralph Lauren-- I

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.540
don't know if you
know some of them.

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.500
It's a long, long list--
Vera Wang, Tory Burch,

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:34.590
John Varvatos, Joseph Abboud,
the CEO today of Michael Kors--

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:37.790
his name is John Idol--
a long, long list.

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:41.320
Heather mentioned Lorne
Michaels from SNL, George Lucas

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:44.759
for special effects in film,
Roger Corman for B-level films,

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:46.300
actually, for those
of you who follow

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:53.400
that, Larry Ellison for being
Larry Ellison-- about 18

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.707
in all, 18 really
different industries.

00:04:55.707 --> 00:04:57.040
And so it's kind of interesting.

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:58.415
Every industry I
looked at, I was

00:04:58.415 --> 00:05:02.040
able to find the one person
that had this outsized ability--

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:04.190
track record-- of
developing talent.

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:05.370
And that's interesting.

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:07.179
But that's, you know,
just interesting.

00:05:07.179 --> 00:05:08.220
What do you do with that?

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:10.480
And so I started studying
them and interviewing them

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:12.650
and interviewing a lot of the
people that work for them,

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:13.566
a lot of the proteges.

00:05:13.566 --> 00:05:17.010
Hundreds of interviews over
many years of looking at this.

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:19.870
And what I was interested
in understanding

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:21.570
is, what do they do
that's different?

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:23.580
What do these people do that's
different than other good

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:24.910
bosses or other good leaders?

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:27.140
And that's what I want
to talk about in the time

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:31.510
that we have this afternoon,
some of the highlights of that.

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:33.420
So number one, it
starts with-- and I

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:36.310
call this a superboss playbook--
it starts with talent,

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:37.600
finding great talent.

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:40.980
Now, what does that mean when it
comes to what superbosses did?

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:44.370
Well, they will look for
talent in unusual places.

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:48.250
Bill Walsh is a good
example, actually.

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:50.290
One of the major
reasons why there

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:53.520
are any African American
head coaches in the NFL

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:54.750
is because of Bill Walsh.

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:59.180
He saw an untapped talent
pool-- ex-NFL players,

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:02.490
very smart, very
capable, motivated,

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:04.310
that happened to be
African American.

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:06.730
And he purposely
looked for that talent

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:08.810
and created a variety of
training and development

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:10.440
programs for them.

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:12.410
And they became
assistant coaches for him

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:14.890
and moved all the way up
to becoming a head coach.

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:16.670
In that industry
at that time, that

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:18.090
was an untapped talent pool.

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:23.220
Or Jay Chiat, Chiat-Day-- a big
advertising agency-- Chiat-Day

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:25.390
is the agency that
did the 1984 Apple

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:28.990
ad that's kind of legendary
during the Super Bowl.

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:31.320
And if you've watched
"Mad Men," you

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:34.230
know what's missing at the
top of advertising agencies

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:36.290
in the 1960s and '70s and '80s.

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:37.130
And that's women.

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:38.020
And he saw that, too.

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:39.360
And he said, this is an
untapped talent pool.

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:40.110
That's nuts.

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:43.140
Let's go purposely
seek out women that

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:44.640
have the potential, the talent.

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:49.010
And let's fast-track them
into bigger opportunities.

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:52.350
So one of the nice side effects
of a superboss mindset when

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:54.920
it comes to talent is
you get more diversity.

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:57.650
I don't know they set out to
get diversity in and of itself,

00:06:57.650 --> 00:06:58.510
but they got it.

00:06:58.510 --> 00:06:59.760
But they got it.

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:03.040
They'll hire people without
a job description, which

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:05.280
traditional HR people,
they kind of freak out

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:07.370
a little bit with that.

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:09.300
There's a famous story
about Ralph Lauren.

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:12.002
He's in a restaurant in New York
with his family having dinner.

00:07:12.002 --> 00:07:13.460
And at a table next
to him, there's

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:16.430
a group of three
women, one of whom

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:18.794
is dressed really kind
of cool and special.

00:07:18.794 --> 00:07:20.460
And her clothes were
making a statement.

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:21.882
Ralph noticed her.

00:07:21.882 --> 00:07:23.340
And over the course
of the dinner--

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:25.048
they're chatting a
little bit on and off.

00:07:25.048 --> 00:07:26.390
That happens sometimes.

00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:29.330
And Ralph and his family
are done with dinner.

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:30.960
And they get up to leave.

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:32.822
But before he leaves,
he goes over to her

00:07:32.822 --> 00:07:34.280
and he takes his
business card out.

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:36.830
And he gives it to
her, and he says--

00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:39.570
she didn't recognize who he was,
and he never said his name--

00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:42.362
and he says to her, I'd like you
to come in if you have a chance

00:07:42.362 --> 00:07:43.320
tomorrow to the office.

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:44.620
I want to offer you a job.

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:46.370
And she looks down and
says, Ralph Lauren?

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:48.330
Ralph Lauren's
offering me a job?

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:49.970
What's going on?

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:52.770
Can you hire thousands
of people like that?

00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:57.050
If you have thousands of talent
spotters, you might be able to.

00:07:57.050 --> 00:07:59.100
Every single person
in an organization

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:01.390
should become a talent
scout, a talent spotter.

00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:03.870
Wherever you go, the
antenna should be up.

00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:06.680
Is this someone that
has something special,

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:08.320
some energy, some potential?

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:10.070
It doesn't mean you
hire them on the spot.

00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:12.260
But maybe you build the
beginning of a relationship.

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:13.593
You find out what they're doing.

00:08:13.593 --> 00:08:17.820
And you look for those
opportunities-- hiring people

00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:21.010
without a job description.

00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:24.419
What do they look
for specifically?

00:08:24.419 --> 00:08:26.210
So there are a lot of
different industries.

00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:27.876
So the details differ,
of course, right?

00:08:27.876 --> 00:08:31.430
But there were four
characteristics or attributes

00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:34.059
that I kept seeing
among the people that

00:08:34.059 --> 00:08:36.850
were getting hired that super
bosses liked that they ended up

00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:37.440
hiring.

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:39.320
And those four
things were-- number

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:44.030
one is intelligence, extreme
intelligence ideally-- not

00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:47.550
just IQ, could be EQ,
emotional intelligence,

00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:50.516
relationship skills, depends
on what the business is.

00:08:50.516 --> 00:08:52.515
And some of these people
are legendary for this.

00:08:52.515 --> 00:08:55.020
Did you ever hear the story
about Larry Ellison about that?

00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:58.090
He used to tell his trainers
and his HR people that

00:08:58.090 --> 00:09:00.650
were doing interviews,
make sure at some point you

00:09:00.650 --> 00:09:04.057
ask the candidate, are you
the smartest person you know?

00:09:04.057 --> 00:09:04.890
That's the question.

00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:06.230
So how do you answer that?

00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:08.440
If you answer yes,
interview continues.

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:09.850
If you answer no, who is?

00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:12.335
It's Mary, who I worked
with for a couple years.

00:09:12.335 --> 00:09:13.960
And he says, well,
let me go find Mary.

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:14.480
You can go.

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:17.040
The interview's over.

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:19.281
Sounds like a Larry
Ellison thing, doesn't it?

00:09:19.281 --> 00:09:21.530
But it gives you an idea of
the extremes to which they

00:09:21.530 --> 00:09:24.810
went-- so intelligence.

00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:28.892
Creativity-- as you'll see, a
big part of what superbosses do

00:09:28.892 --> 00:09:30.850
is they enhance and they
unleash the creativity

00:09:30.850 --> 00:09:34.190
of individuals doing
whatever it is they're doing.

00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:35.920
Flexibility-- they
like people that

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:37.510
have the aptitude
and interest to do

00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:39.968
a lot of different things, that
could be moved from one job

00:09:39.968 --> 00:09:42.900
to another to take full
advantage of their skills,

00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:45.750
of their mindset, and of
their fresh look at something.

00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:48.990
And the fourth thing I kept
seeing was competitiveness.

00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:50.510
They love competitive people.

00:09:50.510 --> 00:09:52.593
I don't know that all four
of these are originals.

00:09:52.593 --> 00:09:54.590
It's not like Google
doesn't want smart people

00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:55.970
and doesn't want
competitive people,

00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:56.720
doesn't want creative people.

00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:58.820
But this is what superbosses
were looking for.

00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:01.414
These are the four
things I kept seeing.

00:10:01.414 --> 00:10:03.580
Anyway, there's a lot more
I could say about talent.

00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:05.205
But I'm just going
to kind of highlight

00:10:05.205 --> 00:10:07.061
a few things about
the superboss playbook

00:10:07.061 --> 00:10:08.310
to give you a bit of a flavor.

00:10:08.310 --> 00:10:10.601
And, you know, depending on
what you ask me afterwards,

00:10:10.601 --> 00:10:12.630
I can go into it in
more in more detail.

00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:13.790
So you have great talent.

00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:15.560
What's the next thing you do?

00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:17.700
Well, you've got
to energize them.

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:18.912
You've got to motivate them.

00:10:18.912 --> 00:10:20.370
They've got to be
ready for action.

00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:22.530
And one thing about living
in a superboss world

00:10:22.530 --> 00:10:23.520
is the bar is high.

00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:24.800
And it keeps getting higher.

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:26.630
It's not for everyone.

00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:29.040
You've got to be willing
to work hard and be

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:31.450
willing to excel at whatever
it is you're going to do.

00:10:31.450 --> 00:10:32.630
They're not soft touches.

00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:34.171
They're not all the
same personality,

00:10:34.171 --> 00:10:35.477
but they're not soft touches.

00:10:35.477 --> 00:10:37.060
They push you, and
they push you hard.

00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:39.018
I don't think that's all
that shocking, either.

00:10:39.018 --> 00:10:42.380
How many people live in a
24/7 world these days anyways?

00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:44.340
A lot of people work
really, really hard.

00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:50.390
But what superbosses add that
I found many, many managers up

00:10:50.390 --> 00:10:53.290
and down organizations don't
do, or don't do very well,

00:10:53.290 --> 00:10:54.730
is that they inspire.

00:10:54.730 --> 00:10:56.610
They really inspire
the people that

00:10:56.610 --> 00:11:00.090
work for them to feel like
there's nothing they can't do.

00:11:00.090 --> 00:11:02.860
Again, Ralph Lauren used to
say to the people in his team,

00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:05.380
we are the ones that
set the standard.

00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:07.350
People-- everyone
else follows us.

00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:08.304
We don't follow them.

00:11:08.304 --> 00:11:09.470
And you better believe that.

00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:10.550
You better be
authentic with that.

00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:11.925
You can't fake a
thing like that.

00:11:11.925 --> 00:11:15.800
But that was the message
he was communicating.

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:16.840
He truly believed it.

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:19.620
People that worked for Ralph and
many of the other superbosses,

00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:21.960
they felt almost like
they were the chosen ones,

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:24.920
that they were special
to have that opportunity.

00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:28.990
And the one thing-- in
many of the interviews,

00:11:28.990 --> 00:11:31.590
they said something like, the
one thing I never wanted to do

00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:33.030
is let my boss down.

00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:36.140
I never did wanted to let Tommy
Frist-- CEO of HCA-- I never

00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:37.380
wanted to let him down.

00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:38.560
So they inspire people.

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:40.640
They energize people.

00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:43.570
And that is a really
important part

00:11:43.570 --> 00:11:47.050
of being an effective leader,
no matter what job you've got.

00:11:47.050 --> 00:11:48.900
Because you've
got to give people

00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:50.900
a reason why they need
to go through brick walls

00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:52.080
and do unbelievable things.

00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:54.140
And some people are
internally motivated.

00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:56.670
But at some point,
people burn out also.

00:11:56.670 --> 00:12:01.000
And that inspiration
part, if it's genuine,

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.470
if it's authentic,
it's a gigantic factor

00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:06.180
that keeps people in
the game and makes

00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:08.430
them feel like they're really
accomplishing something,

00:12:08.430 --> 00:12:10.120
something special.

00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:15.880
Related to that is the V
word, the "vision" word.

00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:18.110
It's absolutely true
that superbosses have

00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:21.880
these broad, powerful visions.

00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:24.210
Alice Waters, from Chez
Panisse restaurant,

00:12:24.210 --> 00:12:26.960
her vision was to create a
world-- create a restaurant

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:30.930
as this platform, as I said,
to change the way America eats.

00:12:30.930 --> 00:12:32.560
That's a gigantic, crazy vision.

00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:35.170
George Lucas had a
vision to create what

00:12:35.170 --> 00:12:38.260
eventually became "Star Wars."

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:40.590
But there was no technology
available to do it.

00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:42.840
He had to invent-- which
is really kind of amazing--

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:45.389
he had to invent countless
new digital technologies

00:12:45.389 --> 00:12:46.180
to accomplish that.

00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:48.280
But that was the vision
he was driving towards.

00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:51.340
Ralph Lauren is the same
way, this idea of clothes

00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:53.650
being part of your
lifestyle and integrating it

00:12:53.650 --> 00:12:56.140
in a way that's consistent
with his image of life

00:12:56.140 --> 00:12:57.220
is a movie, really.

00:12:57.220 --> 00:12:58.490
They have these visions.

00:12:58.490 --> 00:13:01.999
And you know, they will not
compromise on those visions.

00:13:01.999 --> 00:13:03.540
If you don't like
that vision, if you

00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:06.200
can't live with that vision,
you will not succeed.

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:07.760
You may be hired.

00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:08.940
It would be a mistake.

00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:10.037
And you will not last.

00:13:10.037 --> 00:13:11.370
You have to buy into the vision.

00:13:11.370 --> 00:13:12.786
I call this-- one
of the chapters,

00:13:12.786 --> 00:13:17.240
the title of the chapter
is "Uncompromisingly Open."

00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:19.740
So you heard the
uncompromising part, but what

00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:20.870
about the open part?

00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:22.930
And this is one of these
counterintuitive things

00:13:22.930 --> 00:13:25.110
that superbosses do.

00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:28.120
At the same time as having
this expansive vision--

00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:31.680
at the same time, they
unleash the creativity

00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:33.640
of the people in
their organizations,

00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:36.950
of their team members,
of their peers.

00:13:36.950 --> 00:13:40.560
And the reason they do that is
because they feel so strongly

00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:43.770
about fulfilling whatever
their goal is, their vision is,

00:13:43.770 --> 00:13:45.390
that they want every
idea you've got.

00:13:45.390 --> 00:13:47.820
They want all the best ideas.

00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:50.280
They don't think they've
got all the answers.

00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:53.590
They are constantly looking
for better solutions.

00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:55.680
So often I heard
from my interviews

00:13:55.680 --> 00:14:04.320
this idea of how a superboss
would be so excited

00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:06.860
and found it so
rewarding to learn

00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:10.750
something new from someone
who worked for her or for him.

00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:13.320
Many, many bosses have a
very different philosophy

00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:14.070
about that.

00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:16.040
But they loved the idea
of learning something.

00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:17.680
And they love a good fight.

00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:18.980
They love a good disagreement.

00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:20.660
I mean, of course, Larry
Ellison is famous for that.

00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:22.576
But every one of the
superbosses were.

00:14:22.576 --> 00:14:24.450
And it doesn't mean you
always win the battle

00:14:24.450 --> 00:14:25.908
or win the argument
with your boss.

00:14:25.908 --> 00:14:28.410
But they loved-- they
wanted someone that could--

00:14:28.410 --> 00:14:31.500
that was willing to go for
it, had something to say.

00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:32.000
You said it.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:33.625
And if you thought
it's the right idea,

00:14:33.625 --> 00:14:34.960
you engage in the discussion.

00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:37.930
And you're not afraid to tell
your boss or your colleagues,

00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:40.221
"you know, I think you're
wrong about this; here's why"

00:14:40.221 --> 00:14:44.306
in an analytical, careful way.

00:14:44.306 --> 00:14:44.930
They love that.

00:14:44.930 --> 00:14:46.050
They value that.

00:14:46.050 --> 00:14:48.010
And so you have an
interesting situation

00:14:48.010 --> 00:14:51.420
where you have this
uncompromising vision,

00:14:51.420 --> 00:14:53.660
but yet all these ideas,
whatever you've got,

00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:54.990
is important.

00:14:54.990 --> 00:15:00.340
Creativity becomes part
of your everyday job,

00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:02.000
no matter what it is you do.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.010
If you're trying to
create something new,

00:15:05.010 --> 00:15:07.780
you might have some skunk
works or some task force.

00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:08.810
That might happen.

00:15:08.810 --> 00:15:11.290
But more likely than
not, everyone every day

00:15:11.290 --> 00:15:13.910
is supposed to keep thinking
of new ways of doing things.

00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:17.169
And if you work for someone like
that, or with people like that,

00:15:17.169 --> 00:15:18.460
it's pretty exciting, isn't it?

00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:21.485
I mean, it's pretty powerful
because it means you count.

00:15:21.485 --> 00:15:24.310
It means every individual
has the potential

00:15:24.310 --> 00:15:25.630
to make a difference.

00:15:25.630 --> 00:15:28.740
You may know about
employee engagement scores,

00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:30.569
which Gallup keeps reporting.

00:15:30.569 --> 00:15:31.860
And they vary a lot, of course.

00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:35.780
But the biggest survey from
Gallup from about a year

00:15:35.780 --> 00:15:40.130
ago showed something like
25% of all employees rated

00:15:40.130 --> 00:15:42.780
said that they were
highly engaged at work.

00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:45.630
I mean, 25%.

00:15:45.630 --> 00:15:46.540
That's unbelievable.

00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:49.760
That means 75% said either
they were not engaged

00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:52.460
or a little bit engaged or just
a touch engaged, or whatever.

00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:55.420
Not highly engaged-- I
mean, that's unbelievable.

00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:59.190
That's not just a managerial
failure or a leadership

00:15:59.190 --> 00:15:59.710
failure.

00:15:59.710 --> 00:16:02.293
That's actually a moral failure,
if you really think about it.

00:16:02.293 --> 00:16:04.830
That so many people
go to work and don't

00:16:04.830 --> 00:16:07.000
feel fulfilled in
any particular way

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.160
from that work, that's wrong.

00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:10.650
And leaders need
to do everything

00:16:10.650 --> 00:16:14.270
they can to make sure that
doesn't happen in their world.

00:16:14.270 --> 00:16:17.700
And the benefits are
endless because you end up

00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:18.820
with better talent.

00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:21.500
You end up with more
motivated, energized talent.

00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:22.820
As a result, you do better.

00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:24.220
They do better.

00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:25.870
The organization will do better.

00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:28.650
And yet you'll be helping
them accomplish more.

00:16:28.650 --> 00:16:32.950
So if you put together what I've
said so far, what did I say?

00:16:32.950 --> 00:16:34.290
They find unusual talent.

00:16:34.290 --> 00:16:37.870
They look for them-- they look
for diamonds in the rough.

00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:39.480
And they push them hard.

00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:41.690
And they create a
high-performance culture.

00:16:41.690 --> 00:16:45.350
And they inspire them to really
feel like they can do anything.

00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:47.710
And they have a vision
that is motivating,

00:16:47.710 --> 00:16:50.220
and it's exciting that
you want to be part of.

00:16:50.220 --> 00:16:53.400
And you unleash the creativity
of people around you.

00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:55.130
What kind of organization
do you create

00:16:55.130 --> 00:16:56.379
when you do a thing like that?

00:16:56.379 --> 00:16:58.739
I mean, it's a pretty amazing
thing that you can do.

00:16:58.739 --> 00:17:01.030
And, in fact, you create an
organization that, I think,

00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:04.550
will be much more adaptable
and adjustable and agile,

00:17:04.550 --> 00:17:06.329
if you want to use
that word, than a lot

00:17:06.329 --> 00:17:10.760
of other organizations
and a lot of other teams.

00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:14.480
Some of you may know--
either from reading

00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:17.099
something or business school or
who knows where-- but there's

00:17:17.099 --> 00:17:21.584
a dominant model of change or
change management in business.

00:17:21.584 --> 00:17:24.000
Almost everyone around the
world that's a senior executive

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:24.920
seems to know this.

00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:27.960
And it came from some
work by John Kotter at HBS

00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:29.270
over a number of decades.

00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:31.940
And the model is that if
you want people to change,

00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:34.697
you need to create
a sense of urgency.

00:17:34.697 --> 00:17:35.780
It's a common term, right?

00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:37.863
You've got to give people
a real sense of urgency,

00:17:37.863 --> 00:17:40.740
or the other term people
use is a "burning platform,"

00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:43.480
create a burning platform
to get people to change.

00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:44.930
I mean, think about that.

00:17:44.930 --> 00:17:46.217
Isn't that crazy?

00:17:46.217 --> 00:17:48.550
You need to have your house
virtually on fire before you

00:17:48.550 --> 00:17:49.510
do anything about it?

00:17:49.510 --> 00:17:51.051
You need to be almost
in the hospital

00:17:51.051 --> 00:17:54.330
before you start eating
better or exercising?

00:17:54.330 --> 00:17:57.290
Why do we need to create a
view of the world of change

00:17:57.290 --> 00:17:59.830
that we have to be in
a disastrous situation

00:17:59.830 --> 00:18:02.210
before we actually do
something about that?

00:18:02.210 --> 00:18:06.790
A lot of big companies have
fallen by the wayside exactly

00:18:06.790 --> 00:18:08.520
because of that mentality.

00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:11.090
Jim Collins, famous from
"Good to Great," of course,

00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:14.850
wrote a book called "Built to
Last" a few years before that.

00:18:14.850 --> 00:18:17.720
And I think "Built to Last"
is the wrong metaphor.

00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:19.740
I think actually
what we want in teams

00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:22.920
and in organizations is
to be built to change.

00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:25.822
I think built to change is much
more powerful because that's

00:18:25.822 --> 00:18:27.530
going to allow you--
or at least increase

00:18:27.530 --> 00:18:31.950
the odds of you being adaptable,
adjustable, flexible, agile,

00:18:31.950 --> 00:18:34.164
dealing with the
famous disruptions that

00:18:34.164 --> 00:18:35.580
are going on
everywhere, and being

00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:38.490
ahead of the curve in that.

00:18:38.490 --> 00:18:41.350
And the irony is, I think, when
you create an organization that

00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:46.550
is built to change, you
actually last a lot longer.

00:18:46.550 --> 00:18:50.180
So the superboss mindset,
the superboss playbook,

00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:51.590
is not just about leadership.

00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:53.700
It's not just about how
to work more effectively.

00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:55.590
It's not just about helping
other people get better,

00:18:55.590 --> 00:18:57.256
although it's about
all of those things.

00:18:57.256 --> 00:18:58.770
It's also building
an organization

00:18:58.770 --> 00:19:03.230
that's much more adaptable,
adjustable, and agile.

00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:07.560
Let me say one last part-- and
I'm skipping over a few things

00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:09.470
so we can get to
that afterwards.

00:19:09.470 --> 00:19:12.400
But one last part of
the superboss playbook

00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:15.240
that I think is
important-- and then we'll

00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:18.380
open up for some questions,
see you want to talk about.

00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:21.460
I didn't really say anything
about how superbosses develop

00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:23.910
talent on a day-to-day basis.

00:19:23.910 --> 00:19:25.660
And so let me say a
little bit about that.

00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:30.650
And it turns out that over
a matter of centuries,

00:19:30.650 --> 00:19:34.000
there has been one
dominant method

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.050
of people learning their
craft or their skill

00:19:37.050 --> 00:19:39.854
or their capability.

00:19:39.854 --> 00:19:41.770
And it's been going on,
really, for centuries.

00:19:41.770 --> 00:19:44.061
And, of course, that's called
an apprenticeship, right?

00:19:44.061 --> 00:19:45.890
That's how it works.

00:19:45.890 --> 00:19:48.710
Leonardo da Vinci
was in the workshop

00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:50.570
of Verrocchio in Florence.

00:19:50.570 --> 00:19:53.150
That's how he learned at
the beginning of his career,

00:19:53.150 --> 00:19:55.610
when he was 13 years old,
when he went in the work.

00:19:55.610 --> 00:19:56.790
Everyone learned that way.

00:19:56.790 --> 00:19:59.410
But where are these
apprenticeships today?

00:19:59.410 --> 00:20:01.610
Some companies say or
tell me, yeah, we do that.

00:20:01.610 --> 00:20:03.210
But I haven't seen
very much of it.

00:20:03.210 --> 00:20:04.160
It's unusual.

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:06.320
And maybe you'll see it
for some technical skills,

00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:10.130
but for management and for
leadership, much less likely.

00:20:10.130 --> 00:20:11.970
And so what
superbosses have done

00:20:11.970 --> 00:20:15.580
is they've resurrected, in
their own way, an apprenticeship

00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:17.510
model to developing talent.

00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:20.630
So let me tell you in
brief what that means.

00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:24.090
Number one-- big
opportunities for people.

00:20:24.090 --> 00:20:27.300
If you see someone
that has potential,

00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:29.210
you look for big opportunities.

00:20:29.210 --> 00:20:31.070
You delegate big to them.

00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:34.110
I gave a talk to a different
group not that long ago,

00:20:34.110 --> 00:20:37.270
and there's a CHRO,
Chief HR Officer,

00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:40.199
of a Fortune 100
company that was there.

00:20:40.199 --> 00:20:41.490
In the Q&amp;A, he raised his hand.

00:20:41.490 --> 00:20:43.656
And he said, I want to tell
you what happened to me.

00:20:43.656 --> 00:20:48.300
When I was 28 years old, my
boss gave me an assignment

00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:51.110
to go to Japan and become
the HR director in Japan

00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:52.910
at the age of 28.

00:20:52.910 --> 00:20:54.770
And he wasn't a Japanese native.

00:20:54.770 --> 00:20:56.960
He wasn't a Japanese speaker.

00:20:56.960 --> 00:20:59.050
And he told his boss,
no, you're crazy.

00:20:59.050 --> 00:21:00.400
There's no way I can do that.

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:03.420
And his boss, of course,
told him-- or his superboss

00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:05.830
told him, I wouldn't
ask you to do it,

00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:08.210
I would give you this
opportunity if I wasn't very,

00:21:08.210 --> 00:21:09.450
very sure you could do it.

00:21:09.450 --> 00:21:10.740
And I'll support you
in the beginning,

00:21:10.740 --> 00:21:12.365
but then you're going
to figure it out.

00:21:12.365 --> 00:21:13.616
And so he ended up doing that.

00:21:13.616 --> 00:21:15.531
He was there, I think,
for four or five years.

00:21:15.531 --> 00:21:17.140
And as he was
describing it, he talked

00:21:17.140 --> 00:21:20.652
about how it changed his
life because he did something

00:21:20.652 --> 00:21:21.860
that was really, really hard.

00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:23.120
He worked like crazy to do it.

00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:25.060
I mean, the cultural difference,
the language difference--

00:21:25.060 --> 00:21:26.025
you can imagine.

00:21:26.025 --> 00:21:28.070
And at that age, as
well, in a culture

00:21:28.070 --> 00:21:31.800
that's quite-- where
hierarchy and age means a lot.

00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:32.840
But he did it.

00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:33.910
And he succeeded.

00:21:33.910 --> 00:21:37.370
And after that, he felt like
there's nothing he couldn't do,

00:21:37.370 --> 00:21:39.560
that there's nothing
he couldn't accomplish.

00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:41.790
And I'm sure that some of
you, maybe many of you,

00:21:41.790 --> 00:21:43.960
have had either a boss or
a colleague or maybe even

00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:47.460
a teacher that has given
you that gift, given you

00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:50.450
this tremendous opportunity
that when you accomplish that,

00:21:50.450 --> 00:21:53.870
you fulfill that, it's just--
it accelerates your career.

00:21:53.870 --> 00:21:55.560
It builds tremendous confidence.

00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:57.220
And that's also a
gift that you can

00:21:57.220 --> 00:22:00.390
do when you have people that
work for you or your colleagues

00:22:00.390 --> 00:22:03.240
as well, to give them those
types of opportunities.

00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:05.350
That's a big part of
the apprentice approach.

00:22:05.350 --> 00:22:08.260
I'll say two other things
about the apprentice approach

00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:11.780
and then finally, Q&amp;A.
Along with big delegation

00:22:11.780 --> 00:22:15.780
and opportunities, it
turns out that superbosses

00:22:15.780 --> 00:22:17.680
don't just delegate and forget.

00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:20.330
They will roll up their
sleeves and work very closely

00:22:20.330 --> 00:22:22.480
with people on their
team periodically.

00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:24.970
They will get close to that
line that everybody tells

00:22:24.970 --> 00:22:26.960
you don't want to be
close to, the line

00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:30.620
that starts with "micro"
and ends with "management."

00:22:30.620 --> 00:22:32.360
That's a bad thing,
everybody says that.

00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:34.050
And I don't call
them micromanagers

00:22:34.050 --> 00:22:35.230
in any traditional sense.

00:22:35.230 --> 00:22:36.771
To me, a micromanager
is someone that

00:22:36.771 --> 00:22:38.769
does their team members' work.

00:22:38.769 --> 00:22:39.560
They don't do that.

00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:41.860
But they don't exactly
ignore what's going on.

00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:44.640
They will parachute
in sometimes.

00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:45.900
They'll show up at meetings.

00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:48.830
They'll spend half a day
going through a project.

00:22:48.830 --> 00:22:50.260
And what are they doing?

00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:51.640
They're not doing your work,
but they're teaching you.

00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:52.570
They're pushing you.

00:22:52.570 --> 00:22:54.153
They're changing the
rules of the game

00:22:54.153 --> 00:22:56.490
as you're going along to
try to understand it better.

00:22:56.490 --> 00:22:58.270
It's like getting a
one-on-one tutorial

00:22:58.270 --> 00:22:59.950
with a true master,
somebody who's

00:22:59.950 --> 00:23:02.129
been doing something
for 10 or 20 years,

00:23:02.129 --> 00:23:03.670
or even two or three
years, depending

00:23:03.670 --> 00:23:06.980
on the industry--
very, very powerful.

00:23:06.980 --> 00:23:08.240
Very, very powerful.

00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:11.680
And a lot of people look
at this and say, well,

00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:12.830
how can that happen?

00:23:12.830 --> 00:23:15.470
Many people talk about-- you
ask them about their boss,

00:23:15.470 --> 00:23:17.910
they say, well, my boss
is a big delegator.

00:23:17.910 --> 00:23:21.230
And other people say, I'm stuck
with-- she's a micromanager.

00:23:21.230 --> 00:23:24.230
It turns out as soon as
you open your head and say,

00:23:24.230 --> 00:23:26.870
these are not the same
continuum, where you're either

00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:29.500
a delegate or a micromanager,
but there's two lines going on

00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:30.440
at the same time.

00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:32.690
And you can be a big delegator
and a small delegator.

00:23:32.690 --> 00:23:34.990
Or you could be a big
micromanager and a very little

00:23:34.990 --> 00:23:35.860
micromanager.

00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:37.940
As soon as you realize
that, which is true,

00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:41.750
you could imagine how these
two things could be combined.

00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:44.160
So I actually have a
lot more I could say.

00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:47.086
But I want to leave
time to talk about what

00:23:47.086 --> 00:23:48.490
you want to talk about.

00:23:48.490 --> 00:23:51.040
So should we open
it up for some Q&amp;A?

00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:53.100
And I'll weave in a
few other stories.

00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:55.250
But I'm really
interested in what you're

00:23:55.250 --> 00:23:57.040
wondering about from this.

00:23:57.040 --> 00:23:58.650
AUDIENCE: I have two questions.

00:23:58.650 --> 00:24:02.190
The first is, you're talking
a lot about the superbosses

00:24:02.190 --> 00:24:04.530
from the point at which
they already are bosses.

00:24:04.530 --> 00:24:06.238
And maybe I missed
this at the beginning,

00:24:06.238 --> 00:24:08.010
but I'm curious if
there are any patterns

00:24:08.010 --> 00:24:12.600
about their own development,
too, before they were bosses?

00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:13.530
So that's one thing.

00:24:13.530 --> 00:24:15.363
And then the second
thing was, you mentioned

00:24:15.363 --> 00:24:17.580
George Lucas and his vision.

00:24:17.580 --> 00:24:19.590
And I have always
found it interesting

00:24:19.590 --> 00:24:21.740
how he sold the
franchise to Disney.

00:24:21.740 --> 00:24:24.860
And part of it is knowing
when to let go of your vision

00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:25.500
and move on.

00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:28.200
And I wonder just
your thoughts on that.

00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:31.260
It seemed kind of early in
terms of giving it away,

00:24:31.260 --> 00:24:36.170
but maybe that's part of the key
of being able to develop a halo

00:24:36.170 --> 00:24:38.880
effect of other people
taking on your vision

00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:40.290
and adapting it for their own.

00:24:40.290 --> 00:24:41.090
So those are my two questions.

00:24:41.090 --> 00:24:42.465
SYDNEY FINKELSTEIN:
Right, right.

00:24:42.465 --> 00:24:44.640
So first on the
George Lucas thing,

00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:47.540
I think that's probably pretty
unusual from the superbosses

00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:49.866
that I talked to
or that I studied,

00:24:49.866 --> 00:24:50.990
that they would give it up.

00:24:50.990 --> 00:24:53.290
But he was a certain age.

00:24:53.290 --> 00:24:56.350
And you got one of these offers
you can't refuse type of thing,

00:24:56.350 --> 00:24:56.870
right?

00:24:56.870 --> 00:25:01.156
And who would be the best
owner of these assets,

00:25:01.156 --> 00:25:02.530
if it's not George
Lucas himself?

00:25:02.530 --> 00:25:04.238
Most people would
probably say, a company

00:25:04.238 --> 00:25:06.950
that knows how to
do stuff like that.

00:25:06.950 --> 00:25:08.420
But that wasn't
a common pattern.

00:25:08.420 --> 00:25:11.812
Most people went-- I mean,
Ralph Lauren, what is he, 75

00:25:11.812 --> 00:25:12.770
or something like that?

00:25:12.770 --> 00:25:16.110
He just now recently appointed
a new CEO, and he's the chair.

00:25:16.110 --> 00:25:17.970
So he's not ready to step aside.

00:25:17.970 --> 00:25:19.400
Julian Robertson's 80 years old.

00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:23.010
He's still somewhat-- not nearly
as much-- somewhat involved.

00:25:23.010 --> 00:25:25.100
So the first
question, how do you

00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:27.030
get to-- what do
they do along the way

00:25:27.030 --> 00:25:28.990
to become that superboss?

00:25:28.990 --> 00:25:30.810
So one thing is
true-- superbosses

00:25:30.810 --> 00:25:32.850
do create more superbosses.

00:25:32.850 --> 00:25:36.300
So I saw that by
many of the proteges

00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:39.260
that I talked to-- I call
them proteges, but former team

00:25:39.260 --> 00:25:40.990
members.

00:25:40.990 --> 00:25:43.310
In many instances-- and
not all, because there's

00:25:43.310 --> 00:25:45.270
some attrition-- but
in many instances,

00:25:45.270 --> 00:25:48.450
they learned-- I asked in my
interviews, what did you learn?

00:25:48.450 --> 00:25:52.410
And that could be an hour-long
discussion around that.

00:25:52.410 --> 00:25:54.070
And it was very specific.

00:25:54.070 --> 00:25:57.680
And it almost always included,
along with some very specific

00:25:57.680 --> 00:25:59.960
things to that
industry, a lot of ideas

00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:02.020
about developing talent,
thinking about people

00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:05.620
a little bit differently.

00:26:05.620 --> 00:26:10.620
And I think the other
thing that's-- I can't say

00:26:10.620 --> 00:26:12.950
it's a conclusion; it's more
like an observation-- is,

00:26:12.950 --> 00:26:15.408
a number of superbosses really
felt like they had something

00:26:15.408 --> 00:26:18.120
to prove, almost like they
had a chip on their shoulder,

00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:21.390
which doesn't make you--
if you measure that,

00:26:21.390 --> 00:26:22.890
does that predict
being a superboss?

00:26:22.890 --> 00:26:23.390
No.

00:26:23.390 --> 00:26:25.860
But going backwards, I say,
actually, a surprising number

00:26:25.860 --> 00:26:29.020
did-- Larry Ellison
and Norman Brinker

00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:33.050
from casual restaurant
industry, a whole bunch of them.

00:26:33.050 --> 00:26:37.260
Bill Walsh was passed over as
the head coach for-- I think

00:26:37.260 --> 00:26:39.210
it was Cincinnati Bengals
or Cleveland Browns,

00:26:39.210 --> 00:26:41.940
one or the other-- when he was
ready, thought he was ready.

00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:44.082
And he vowed right then
that when he has a chance

00:26:44.082 --> 00:26:46.040
to be a head coach, he's
never going to do that

00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:47.830
to someone who's ready.

00:26:47.830 --> 00:26:50.190
And actually what he
did, which is really

00:26:50.190 --> 00:26:52.650
unusual-- I didn't talk
about this part yet--

00:26:52.650 --> 00:26:56.080
but Bill Walsh would actually,
when there was a head coach

00:26:56.080 --> 00:26:59.780
opening, he would actually pick
up the phone and call an owner

00:26:59.780 --> 00:27:01.514
and tell the owner,
you should hire

00:27:01.514 --> 00:27:03.930
one of my assistant coaches
if he thought they were ready.

00:27:03.930 --> 00:27:06.670
And that's really extreme
because you are now

00:27:06.670 --> 00:27:09.550
giving one of your best
talents to a direct competitor.

00:27:09.550 --> 00:27:11.740
But that's kind of what he did.

00:27:11.740 --> 00:27:13.320
He felt so strongly about that.

00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:14.986
So there's a couple
thoughts about that.

00:27:16.822 --> 00:27:19.280
AUDIENCE: The way that you're
describing superbosses sounds

00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:21.740
like a very personal experience,
like person-to-person

00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:24.850
experience while will
grow like a tree,

00:27:24.850 --> 00:27:26.810
doesn't really
scale that quickly.

00:27:26.810 --> 00:27:29.920
Have you seen any examples
where the superboss lessons

00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:32.445
have been institutionalized or
taught in a more rapid pace?

00:27:32.445 --> 00:27:33.820
SYDNEY FINKELSTEIN:
Right, that's

00:27:33.820 --> 00:27:36.330
a great, great
question about scaling.

00:27:36.330 --> 00:27:41.420
And early on, as
part of the research,

00:27:41.420 --> 00:27:43.920
I studied
superboss-like companies

00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:45.310
to see what they had done.

00:27:45.310 --> 00:27:48.100
In the end, I ended up
interested in the origins

00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:49.059
of how does it start?

00:27:49.059 --> 00:27:51.600
Because it starts-- it always
starts with people, number one.

00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:55.190
And number two, any individual
can be a more effective leader

00:27:55.190 --> 00:27:56.885
by adopting the superboss ideas.

00:27:56.885 --> 00:27:58.230
So that's why I did it that way.

00:27:58.230 --> 00:28:01.040
But in fact, there are
a number of examples.

00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:02.120
I mean, some are famous.

00:28:02.120 --> 00:28:04.680
GE has been known for that,
for having that reputation.

00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:06.380
But McKinsey is like that.

00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:08.320
I think at one point,
Goldman Sachs was.

00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:11.060
One of my best examples
that I looked at

00:28:11.060 --> 00:28:14.095
is actually Second City, the
comedy group from Chicago,

00:28:14.095 --> 00:28:16.490
or actually around the
world now, Second City.

00:28:16.490 --> 00:28:19.180
I started to look at
Second City because I

00:28:19.180 --> 00:28:22.680
was interested-- was there
another superboss in the comedy

00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:25.040
world besides Lorne
Michaels from SNL?

00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:28.690
And I couldn't find
anyone within Second City.

00:28:28.690 --> 00:28:31.260
And I thought that was cool and
interesting because they have

00:28:31.260 --> 00:28:32.450
produced hundreds of talent.

00:28:32.450 --> 00:28:33.380
So how'd that happen?

00:28:33.380 --> 00:28:35.463
And then I ended up spending
a long time with them

00:28:35.463 --> 00:28:36.750
and did a whole big analysis.

00:28:36.750 --> 00:28:39.870
And it turns out it had been
inculcated into their culture.

00:28:39.870 --> 00:28:41.460
Many of the things
I'm talking about,

00:28:41.460 --> 00:28:43.020
it wasn't one person doing it.

00:28:43.020 --> 00:28:45.690
It was a whole bunch
of people doing it.

00:28:45.690 --> 00:28:47.850
Now how do you actually
make that happen now,

00:28:47.850 --> 00:28:51.340
as opposed to studying a company
or in organizations like that?

00:28:51.340 --> 00:28:53.420
That's where I'm spending
a ton of my time on.

00:28:53.420 --> 00:28:55.010
I think you actually
can do that.

00:28:55.010 --> 00:28:57.260
First of all, you need to
know whether you have-- not

00:28:57.260 --> 00:29:00.320
whether, because every
company has superbosses.

00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:02.330
Every company has superbosses.

00:29:02.330 --> 00:29:05.800
I know this because-- you
probably think about it,

00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:06.976
and you know superbosses.

00:29:06.976 --> 00:29:09.100
But I've signed-- I've done
a lot of book signings.

00:29:09.100 --> 00:29:11.235
And people ask me to
sign the book over

00:29:11.235 --> 00:29:12.665
to their boss, who
is a superboss.

00:29:12.665 --> 00:29:14.540
And they tell me the
story about that person.

00:29:14.540 --> 00:29:16.030
And it's somebody I never
heard of in a company

00:29:16.030 --> 00:29:17.280
that I barely knew existed.

00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:18.000
There are plenty.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.630
But do we know who they
are in our organization?

00:29:20.630 --> 00:29:23.360
That seems like a baby step.

00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:24.970
And I'm doing that
in my own work

00:29:24.970 --> 00:29:26.260
right now, with an assessment.

00:29:26.260 --> 00:29:30.250
Why aren't we trying to
measure whether we have

00:29:30.250 --> 00:29:32.950
any superbosses, and then
figure out what are they

00:29:32.950 --> 00:29:36.700
doing that has been tailored
to this particular culture,

00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:40.470
and then figure out a way
to teach that or share that?

00:29:40.470 --> 00:29:46.000
There's also, like any
type of attempt to scale,

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.560
there's an entire curriculum
that we're actually developing.

00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:51.240
You could imagine, it's not
like classroom curriculum.

00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:53.070
It will be a platform
and other things that

00:29:53.070 --> 00:29:55.790
will help people become
more effective as leaders,

00:29:55.790 --> 00:29:59.780
adopting a bunch of
the superboss ideas.

00:29:59.780 --> 00:30:02.180
So if you're starting
with none of that,

00:30:02.180 --> 00:30:04.250
it's going to take some time.

00:30:04.250 --> 00:30:05.300
Is it scalable?

00:30:05.300 --> 00:30:09.440
I think it is because I
see these companies exist.

00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:13.127
It's not going to
happen overnight.

00:30:13.127 --> 00:30:14.960
AUDIENCE: You have
talked about superbosses,

00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:19.920
people who manage teams and
inspire people to do something.

00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:22.050
Have you studied
superteachers, people

00:30:22.050 --> 00:30:26.740
who teach people and inspire
them to learn more to educate

00:30:26.740 --> 00:30:28.174
themselves, and so on?

00:30:28.174 --> 00:30:29.590
SYDNEY FINKELSTEIN:
Superteachers?

00:30:29.590 --> 00:30:30.197
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:30:30.197 --> 00:30:32.030
SYDNEY FINKELSTEIN: So
they're very similar,

00:30:32.030 --> 00:30:32.988
as far as I could tell.

00:30:32.988 --> 00:30:36.090
In academia, the idea of
having a famous academic

00:30:36.090 --> 00:30:40.350
that has a lot of PhD students
that go on to great success,

00:30:40.350 --> 00:30:42.020
that's there in every field.

00:30:42.020 --> 00:30:46.800
I think there's even a
website for mathematicians

00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:49.060
that come from-- some of
you will know who it is;

00:30:49.060 --> 00:30:52.577
I don't remember the name--
some very famous mathematician,

00:30:52.577 --> 00:30:54.410
many, many-- an incredible
number of people.

00:30:54.410 --> 00:30:57.690
In my own field of
studying organizations,

00:30:57.690 --> 00:31:01.467
there are two really famous--
there are a lot of famous,

00:31:01.467 --> 00:31:03.050
but there are two
really famous people

00:31:03.050 --> 00:31:05.780
that go back in time
that kind of set--

00:31:05.780 --> 00:31:08.680
that wrote a bunch of
books and other things

00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:10.820
that became highly,
highly influential.

00:31:10.820 --> 00:31:15.720
And one of them is named Jim
March, who is still around,

00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:17.430
and the other one is Herb Simon.

00:31:17.430 --> 00:31:19.900
Now, Herb Simon might be a
name some of you may recognize.

00:31:19.900 --> 00:31:21.530
He won a Nobel
Prize in economics,

00:31:21.530 --> 00:31:25.090
the first non-traditional
economist to win that.

00:31:25.090 --> 00:31:27.730
Fascinating-- Jim
March today, you

00:31:27.730 --> 00:31:31.420
could look at hundreds
of his family tree

00:31:31.420 --> 00:31:34.130
that are among the absolute
leaders around the world

00:31:34.130 --> 00:31:37.300
in organizational studies in
business schools and companies

00:31:37.300 --> 00:31:38.850
and consulting
firms and the like.

00:31:38.850 --> 00:31:40.766
And you look at Herb
Simon, and there's hardly

00:31:40.766 --> 00:31:42.770
anyone, which is really
kind of fascinating.

00:31:42.770 --> 00:31:45.410
It's just not what
he wanted to do.

00:31:45.410 --> 00:31:47.060
So I didn't study it formally.

00:31:47.060 --> 00:31:49.540
I do have in the book
a story about what

00:31:49.540 --> 00:31:55.030
I learned from my own superboss,
my own PhD mentor and advisor,

00:31:55.030 --> 00:31:57.470
that was remarkably similar
to what these others did.

00:31:57.470 --> 00:32:00.514
But I'm quite certain that if I
were to do that type of study,

00:32:00.514 --> 00:32:01.930
it would be actually
kind of easy.

00:32:01.930 --> 00:32:03.555
I think there would
be people like that

00:32:03.555 --> 00:32:05.010
in virtually every field.

00:32:05.010 --> 00:32:09.350
And I suspect in
some ways, they'll

00:32:09.350 --> 00:32:13.610
be even more like the classic
superboss in the sense

00:32:13.610 --> 00:32:18.020
that when you are in
academia, when you're

00:32:18.020 --> 00:32:21.990
working under a professor,
you will almost always

00:32:21.990 --> 00:32:23.120
have to leave.

00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:23.940
You get a degree.

00:32:23.940 --> 00:32:26.930
You've got to get a
job somewhere else.

00:32:26.930 --> 00:32:29.750
And that's the hallmark
of what superbosses do.

00:32:29.750 --> 00:32:32.350
You look at an
industry, and you see

00:32:32.350 --> 00:32:34.369
a lot of the very
successful people,

00:32:34.369 --> 00:32:35.910
and a disproportionate
number of them

00:32:35.910 --> 00:32:37.410
all came from the same person.

00:32:37.410 --> 00:32:38.870
But in a corporate
setting, we say,

00:32:38.870 --> 00:32:40.870
well, we don't want to
lose all our best talent.

00:32:40.870 --> 00:32:42.370
We want to keep
some of that talent.

00:32:42.370 --> 00:32:44.920
And in an academic setting,
that's just the way it works.

00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:46.545
You might bring him
back at some point,

00:32:46.545 --> 00:32:49.460
but almost everyone ends up
going off somewhere else.

00:32:49.460 --> 00:32:53.519
So a couple of
thoughts about that.

00:32:53.519 --> 00:32:55.560
AUDIENCE: You talk a little
bit about superbosses

00:32:55.560 --> 00:32:58.330
being able to identify
other superbosses.

00:32:58.330 --> 00:33:00.330
But what about
someone who's looking

00:33:00.330 --> 00:33:02.240
to identify a
superboss who doesn't

00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:03.460
know they're a superboss?

00:33:03.460 --> 00:33:05.550
How do you go the other
way and find the mentors

00:33:05.550 --> 00:33:06.240
you want to work with?

00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:07.615
SYDNEY FINKELSTEIN:
Right, right.

00:33:07.615 --> 00:33:10.940
So I think this is a great--
I mean, it's a great question,

00:33:10.940 --> 00:33:12.240
a great thing to think about.

00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:14.462
When I talk about this
with my MBA students,

00:33:14.462 --> 00:33:15.670
it's the number one question.

00:33:15.670 --> 00:33:17.170
I talk about it
with undergraduates,

00:33:17.170 --> 00:33:19.230
and it's the number one
question, of course.

00:33:19.230 --> 00:33:20.730
But I think it's
relevant for anyone

00:33:20.730 --> 00:33:23.180
almost at any stage of career.

00:33:23.180 --> 00:33:26.300
So I'm a big fan
of-- when you're

00:33:26.300 --> 00:33:28.720
in an interview with
your prospective boss,

00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:30.400
I think you want
to really plan out

00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:33.350
how you will interview
the interviewer.

00:33:33.350 --> 00:33:34.650
It's not a one-way street.

00:33:34.650 --> 00:33:35.970
It's a two-way street.

00:33:35.970 --> 00:33:37.300
And what do you want to know?

00:33:37.300 --> 00:33:38.640
Well, I would want
to know-- and I'm not

00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:40.230
going to give you the
right wording exactly--

00:33:40.230 --> 00:33:42.180
but what I want to
know is, well, tell me

00:33:42.180 --> 00:33:44.305
about some of the people
that used to work for you.

00:33:44.305 --> 00:33:46.030
Where are they today?

00:33:46.030 --> 00:33:47.090
What do you want to hear?

00:33:47.090 --> 00:33:48.690
Some superstars--
people you've heard of,

00:33:48.690 --> 00:33:50.398
or at least people
you can check on later

00:33:50.398 --> 00:33:53.320
that have done really well.

00:33:53.320 --> 00:33:57.920
Do you stay in touch with people
that used to work for you?

00:33:57.920 --> 00:34:00.939
How often are there job
openings in your team?

00:34:00.939 --> 00:34:02.980
You can kind of figure
that out even before that.

00:34:02.980 --> 00:34:05.438
This is actually one of the
metrics I've been playing with.

00:34:05.438 --> 00:34:06.970
And I'd be curious
about reaction

00:34:06.970 --> 00:34:09.739
to that, which is, in a company
you have these internal job

00:34:09.739 --> 00:34:10.739
boards or whatever
you call them.

00:34:10.739 --> 00:34:11.659
You've got them, too.

00:34:11.659 --> 00:34:15.130
And if there's a manager, where
whenever there's a job opening,

00:34:15.130 --> 00:34:18.580
it gets closed up really
fast versus a manager

00:34:18.580 --> 00:34:20.429
where it seems to
always be-- they always

00:34:20.429 --> 00:34:21.639
need to be hiring somebody.

00:34:21.639 --> 00:34:23.180
And they're growing
at the same pace.

00:34:23.180 --> 00:34:25.730
You've got a control
for that, right?

00:34:25.730 --> 00:34:28.889
I won't say it's definitive,
but it's indicative

00:34:28.889 --> 00:34:30.659
that the manager
where everyone keeps

00:34:30.659 --> 00:34:33.815
wanting to get into that place
and the jobs close down fast,

00:34:33.815 --> 00:34:35.190
there's something
going on there.

00:34:35.190 --> 00:34:35.940
People know.

00:34:35.940 --> 00:34:38.370
And internally, you tend--
you get to know a lot.

00:34:38.370 --> 00:34:43.159
So another way to do it is
keep your eyes open and alert.

00:34:43.159 --> 00:34:46.774
Be mindful, if you will, about
the people that you work with

00:34:46.774 --> 00:34:48.940
and the people that you
interact with in and outside

00:34:48.940 --> 00:34:50.710
of Google, for that
matter, for people

00:34:50.710 --> 00:34:56.090
that seem to have some of
what I'm talking about.

00:34:56.090 --> 00:34:58.740
And one other thing I'd like
to ask-- well, I don't ask,

00:34:58.740 --> 00:35:04.210
but I recommend asking; I
don't need a job anymore--

00:35:04.210 --> 00:35:07.172
I like to ask the
interviewer-- I'd

00:35:07.172 --> 00:35:09.630
like you to ask the interviewer,
how do you spend your day?

00:35:09.630 --> 00:35:11.090
What does a typical
day look like?

00:35:11.090 --> 00:35:14.460
So it's a trick question,
because if they say, well, I'm

00:35:14.460 --> 00:35:16.000
in meetings from
morning to night,

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:17.330
you don't have a superboss.

00:35:17.330 --> 00:35:19.450
Superbosses will
never let themselves

00:35:19.450 --> 00:35:21.550
get so choreographed,
so locked up

00:35:21.550 --> 00:35:24.510
so they have no time to just
kind of plop down next to you

00:35:24.510 --> 00:35:27.095
and spend 30 minutes
drilling into you

00:35:27.095 --> 00:35:28.470
to push you a
little harder, make

00:35:28.470 --> 00:35:30.270
sure you're doing what
you should be doing,

00:35:30.270 --> 00:35:31.684
and maybe get your feedback.

00:35:31.684 --> 00:35:32.850
Of course you have meetings.

00:35:32.850 --> 00:35:35.490
If I can get rid
of meetings, I'm

00:35:35.490 --> 00:35:38.890
going to be on Mount
Rushmore or something.

00:35:38.890 --> 00:35:41.830
But do we have to have
meetings all day long?

00:35:41.830 --> 00:35:43.530
And some people,
they let that happen.

00:35:43.530 --> 00:35:46.010
I consider that the
fault of the individual,

00:35:46.010 --> 00:35:47.280
not the fault of anyone else.

00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:48.390
You can control that.

00:35:48.390 --> 00:35:49.530
Some meetings
you've got to go to.

00:35:49.530 --> 00:35:50.460
But you don't have
to go to everything.

00:35:50.460 --> 00:35:53.150
Anyways, so that's another-- I'm
sure there are bunch of others.

00:35:53.150 --> 00:35:54.820
Actually, as I think
about it, I think

00:35:54.820 --> 00:35:56.552
in the last chapter,
chapter 9, I

00:35:56.552 --> 00:35:59.010
think I have a bunch of other--
some of these, and probably

00:35:59.010 --> 00:36:01.920
a few other questions
that you could

00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:03.420
ask or at least
look for when you're

00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:06.470
trying to find a superboss.

00:36:06.470 --> 00:36:08.752
AUDIENCE: For a fair
amount of people,

00:36:08.752 --> 00:36:10.460
they don't have much
interest in actually

00:36:10.460 --> 00:36:12.210
being a manager or a boss.

00:36:12.210 --> 00:36:15.230
But are there any skills that
you find that superbosses have

00:36:15.230 --> 00:36:19.141
or that people who are not
looking to manage can leverage?

00:36:19.141 --> 00:36:21.140
SYDNEY FINKELSTEIN: Yeah,
great, great question.

00:36:21.140 --> 00:36:24.740
So, in fact, I think
many of the things

00:36:24.740 --> 00:36:28.200
that superbosses do that
help other people get better

00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:29.104
are good things.

00:36:29.104 --> 00:36:31.520
Because it's a good thing to
help other people get better.

00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:32.990
They're colleagues of yours.

00:36:32.990 --> 00:36:34.520
Nobody really works alone.

00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:38.200
So they are peers, they could
be task forces, whatever.

00:36:38.200 --> 00:36:42.660
And so, for example,
feedback is a gigantic thing.

00:36:42.660 --> 00:36:45.600
Superbosses-- all good managers,
really-- love feedback,

00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:46.840
constant feedback.

00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:49.220
You know this-- I'm not
sure how Google does this,

00:36:49.220 --> 00:36:51.580
but there's been
such a trend now

00:36:51.580 --> 00:36:55.760
finally towards blowing up the
annual performance review that

00:36:55.760 --> 00:37:00.770
has gotten so many-- it destroys
more than it creates value.

00:37:00.770 --> 00:37:02.610
And what you should
be doing is constant

00:37:02.610 --> 00:37:04.500
feedback-- you giving
it, you taking it.

00:37:04.500 --> 00:37:07.270
So that's an easy one to do
for anyone, whether you've

00:37:07.270 --> 00:37:08.630
got a boss or not, right?

00:37:08.630 --> 00:37:11.160
The creativity
side is challenging

00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:14.140
people that are working
with you because you

00:37:14.140 --> 00:37:15.840
want to learn from them.

00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:19.010
I think you can do that.

00:37:19.010 --> 00:37:21.470
I think the idea of even being
a talent scout or a talent

00:37:21.470 --> 00:37:22.610
spotter might be relevant.

00:37:22.610 --> 00:37:24.568
It's not that you're
hiring them for your team,

00:37:24.568 --> 00:37:27.970
but you care about your company
or your unit or your team,

00:37:27.970 --> 00:37:31.160
and you want to look for great--
you want to surround yourself

00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:32.480
with other great people.

00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:34.130
Probably if we went
through every one

00:37:34.130 --> 00:37:35.935
of the elements
of the playbook--

00:37:35.935 --> 00:37:37.560
I don't know about
all of the elements,

00:37:37.560 --> 00:37:40.290
but I bet a bunch
of them will be,

00:37:40.290 --> 00:37:42.705
I think, easily transferable.

00:37:42.705 --> 00:37:44.830
AUDIENCE: I have a question,
just building on that.

00:37:44.830 --> 00:37:47.288
So one of the things that I
had written down very similarly

00:37:47.288 --> 00:37:50.370
to what you had said is
this idea of superteams,

00:37:50.370 --> 00:37:56.430
or the point of how peers
cultivate talent, which

00:37:56.430 --> 00:37:57.180
you addressed.

00:37:57.180 --> 00:38:01.060
I'm wondering if you found any
also like, superpartnerships,

00:38:01.060 --> 00:38:03.320
so people who have
partnered together that

00:38:03.320 --> 00:38:06.870
have developed something
special between each other

00:38:06.870 --> 00:38:08.370
and really develop talent?

00:38:08.370 --> 00:38:09.980
I think about Larry
and Sergei, right?

00:38:09.980 --> 00:38:12.669
We're all probably thinking
about a lot of Google examples.

00:38:12.669 --> 00:38:13.710
SYDNEY FINKELSTEIN: Sure.

00:38:13.710 --> 00:38:17.760
AUDIENCE: Did you find any of
these partnerships or teams?

00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:21.072
I think Second City might
be an example of it.

00:38:21.072 --> 00:38:23.030
SYDNEY FINKELSTEIN: Well,
a really good example

00:38:23.030 --> 00:38:24.547
is Lennon-McCartney.

00:38:24.547 --> 00:38:26.380
I'm reading yet another
book on the Beatles,

00:38:26.380 --> 00:38:27.750
so it's fresh in my mind.

00:38:27.750 --> 00:38:29.670
When John Lennon
wrote a great song,

00:38:29.670 --> 00:38:32.030
Paul McCartney said, I'm
going write a better song.

00:38:32.030 --> 00:38:33.760
When McCartney
wrote a great song,

00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:37.560
Lennon said, well, I was
about to say what he said.

00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:40.750
He's going to write-- he's
going to create a better song.

00:38:40.750 --> 00:38:43.760
But at the same time, virtually
every song they wrote,

00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:45.130
they collaborated.

00:38:45.130 --> 00:38:46.380
Paul would show up with John.

00:38:46.380 --> 00:38:47.880
He'd have the
beginning and the end.

00:38:47.880 --> 00:38:48.750
He'd have the tune.

00:38:48.750 --> 00:38:50.874
But it's missing the middle
eight, as they call it,

00:38:50.874 --> 00:38:51.680
or vice versa.

00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:54.780
So this is one of the kind
of really interesting things

00:38:54.780 --> 00:38:58.650
that when it comes to teams
or maybe partnerships,

00:38:58.650 --> 00:39:02.017
combining collaboration and
competition-- another one

00:39:02.017 --> 00:39:03.600
of these things that
most people think

00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:06.630
are different or opposite,
which they could be.

00:39:06.630 --> 00:39:09.460
But in fact, combining
collaboration and competition

00:39:09.460 --> 00:39:11.880
at the same time could
actually bring out the best.

00:39:11.880 --> 00:39:15.810
My favorite example of
that actually is SNL.

00:39:15.810 --> 00:39:23.490
I interviewed John Lennon--
not yet-- Lorne Michaels

00:39:23.490 --> 00:39:24.290
a couple of times.

00:39:24.290 --> 00:39:27.870
And he told me this-- that he
came up with this strategy,

00:39:27.870 --> 00:39:28.990
if you will.

00:39:28.990 --> 00:39:31.026
And he realized this is great.

00:39:31.026 --> 00:39:31.900
And he kept doing it.

00:39:31.900 --> 00:39:33.290
And what is it?

00:39:33.290 --> 00:39:36.119
To get on SNL, like, for
a performer to get airtime

00:39:36.119 --> 00:39:37.160
on SNL, how do you do it?

00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:38.785
It's not a stand-up
comedy show, right?

00:39:38.785 --> 00:39:39.993
So you've got to collaborate.

00:39:39.993 --> 00:39:41.150
You've got to form a skit.

00:39:41.150 --> 00:39:42.290
You need a writer or two.

00:39:42.290 --> 00:39:43.860
You need another
performer or two.

00:39:43.860 --> 00:39:45.890
And that's the definition
of collaboration.

00:39:45.890 --> 00:39:48.540
But what Lorne Michaels does
is, as you get closer to Friday

00:39:48.540 --> 00:39:51.710
night, he creates
typically as much as two

00:39:51.710 --> 00:39:54.660
and a half hours of
content or material.

00:39:54.660 --> 00:39:56.740
But the show's only
an hour and a half.

00:39:56.740 --> 00:39:59.900
And so in the last
36 to 48 hours,

00:39:59.900 --> 00:40:01.550
you need some
pretty sharp elbows

00:40:01.550 --> 00:40:03.450
to get your airtime on
there because you're

00:40:03.450 --> 00:40:05.783
going from two and a half
hours to one and a half hours.

00:40:05.783 --> 00:40:07.232
And he purposely was doing this.

00:40:07.232 --> 00:40:08.940
And he said, this is,
like, unbelievable,

00:40:08.940 --> 00:40:10.500
because they've got
to work together.

00:40:10.500 --> 00:40:11.958
But at the same
time, I want to see

00:40:11.958 --> 00:40:14.290
who's got that fire, who
can improve their game so

00:40:14.290 --> 00:40:16.870
much that the audience-- it's
not just him because they do

00:40:16.870 --> 00:40:19.582
these multiple rehearsals
in front of audiences--

00:40:19.582 --> 00:40:21.290
the audience is going
to love it so much.

00:40:21.290 --> 00:40:22.260
So that's competition.

00:40:22.260 --> 00:40:23.230
It's a scarce resource.

00:40:23.230 --> 00:40:24.370
Everybody wants that.

00:40:24.370 --> 00:40:29.669
So yeah, that combination
is pretty interesting.

00:40:29.669 --> 00:40:31.210
AUDIENCE: I have an
obvious question.

00:40:31.210 --> 00:40:32.876
I'm sure you're asked
this all the time.

00:40:32.876 --> 00:40:34.931
Maybe you address
it in the book.

00:40:34.931 --> 00:40:35.930
I haven't read the book.

00:40:35.930 --> 00:40:37.230
I glanced at the introduction.

00:40:37.230 --> 00:40:40.070
It looks as though,
of the superbosses

00:40:40.070 --> 00:40:42.990
you interviewed,
unless I missed some,

00:40:42.990 --> 00:40:47.010
only one was a
woman, Alice Waters.

00:40:47.010 --> 00:40:49.130
I think you mentioned
you considered Hillary

00:40:49.130 --> 00:40:51.120
Clinton and Oprah Winfrey.

00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:54.680
But I was just
noticing yesterday

00:40:54.680 --> 00:40:57.120
that the law firm
Cravath, Swain &amp; Moore

00:40:57.120 --> 00:40:59.760
just appointed its
first-ever female leader.

00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:03.760
And apparently of the top 200
law firms in the United States,

00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:06.490
only three are led by women.

00:41:06.490 --> 00:41:09.720
It seems to me that, in
all of the characteristics

00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:11.920
you're talking about
about superbosses,

00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:15.870
nothing strikes me as
inherently biased against women

00:41:15.870 --> 00:41:17.624
particularly.

00:41:17.624 --> 00:41:19.040
Of everything
you've talked about,

00:41:19.040 --> 00:41:20.706
I don't see a reason
why there shouldn't

00:41:20.706 --> 00:41:23.450
be a lot more women
who have already

00:41:23.450 --> 00:41:25.290
attained superboss status.

00:41:25.290 --> 00:41:28.450
So what are your thoughts
on this whole issue?

00:41:28.450 --> 00:41:29.800
Why don't we have more?

00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:31.780
Are we going to have
more in the future?

00:41:31.780 --> 00:41:32.820
What are the barriers?

00:41:32.820 --> 00:41:36.570
SYDNEY FINKELSTEIN:
Yeah, I came up

00:41:36.570 --> 00:41:41.030
against that as part of
the research process.

00:41:41.030 --> 00:41:42.130
And I started searching.

00:41:42.130 --> 00:41:44.620
And I wasn't
particularly successful.

00:41:44.620 --> 00:41:47.860
I mentioned Sheryl
Sandberg in brief.

00:41:47.860 --> 00:41:49.240
You mention Hillary Clinton.

00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:51.744
Only for one part of
the superboss playbook--

00:41:51.744 --> 00:41:53.910
I didn't really talk much
about it-- is the network.

00:41:53.910 --> 00:41:56.530
And some people consider
that a disaster.

00:41:56.530 --> 00:41:58.980
And some people
consider it fantastic.

00:41:58.980 --> 00:42:01.950
But she has an
unbelievable network.

00:42:01.950 --> 00:42:04.000
Oprah Winfrey, in terms
of developing talent,

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:05.310
is a good example.

00:42:05.310 --> 00:42:08.270
Ann Richards, the former
governor of Texas.

00:42:08.270 --> 00:42:09.702
But not that many.

00:42:09.702 --> 00:42:10.910
And I thought about it a lot.

00:42:10.910 --> 00:42:14.720
And in part for me
to find them, there

00:42:14.720 --> 00:42:17.120
needs to be a track record
of developing talent

00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:18.620
that have gotten
to senior positions

00:42:18.620 --> 00:42:20.295
because that was my
research strategy.

00:42:20.295 --> 00:42:21.420
Well, that takes some time.

00:42:21.420 --> 00:42:22.795
And that means
you would have had

00:42:22.795 --> 00:42:25.610
to be in a very senior
position 10, 20, 30 years ago.

00:42:25.610 --> 00:42:28.130
And of course, the
sample size is tiny.

00:42:28.130 --> 00:42:31.670
So I think that's the biggest
reason why that happened.

00:42:31.670 --> 00:42:33.040
What do I predict?

00:42:33.040 --> 00:42:34.680
I think it will
become-- if I were

00:42:34.680 --> 00:42:37.460
to come back in around 10 years,
I think it'll be more balanced.

00:42:37.460 --> 00:42:40.270
Not completely
balanced, because you

00:42:40.270 --> 00:42:42.850
can look at who are the CEOs
today and they're still many

00:42:42.850 --> 00:42:43.870
more men than women.

00:42:43.870 --> 00:42:46.300
You look at the Fortune 500,
you look at board members,

00:42:46.300 --> 00:42:48.800
you look at senior executives--
still very, very unbalanced.

00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:49.840
But it will be better.

00:42:49.840 --> 00:42:50.720
It will be better.

00:42:50.720 --> 00:42:55.240
So I didn't think there
was anything innately

00:42:55.240 --> 00:42:57.700
odd about what I was finding.

00:42:57.700 --> 00:43:00.880
I think it's
circumstance during due

00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:04.270
to the stage of
where we are in terms

00:43:04.270 --> 00:43:07.590
of the leadership in the
economy, to a large extent,

00:43:07.590 --> 00:43:09.900
and hopefully will
become a little bit less

00:43:09.900 --> 00:43:12.540
imbalanced over time.

00:43:12.540 --> 00:43:14.500
Can I ask everyone a question?

00:43:14.500 --> 00:43:15.000
Yeah?

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:18.100
My question is this-- it
should be right up your alley.

00:43:18.100 --> 00:43:23.600
How do you measure whether
a company has superbosses?

00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:25.250
So I have an assessment.

00:43:25.250 --> 00:43:26.670
It is a survey.

00:43:26.670 --> 00:43:31.430
It's been validated over
several hundred participants.

00:43:31.430 --> 00:43:34.430
And we've done all kinds
of statistical validation

00:43:34.430 --> 00:43:35.000
reliability.

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:35.900
It's pretty good.

00:43:35.900 --> 00:43:38.910
But that's just one--
and it's a survey.

00:43:38.910 --> 00:43:40.115
So it depends on a 360.

00:43:40.115 --> 00:43:41.790
It depends on a lot of things.

00:43:41.790 --> 00:43:43.580
And that's always a
small sample size.

00:43:43.580 --> 00:43:48.840
But I want to figure
out, how do you know?

00:43:48.840 --> 00:43:53.140
I mean, I just had this
conversation with a senior HR

00:43:53.140 --> 00:43:54.390
person at a big company.

00:43:54.390 --> 00:43:55.630
And he said, well,
how do you really know

00:43:55.630 --> 00:43:56.838
whether you have superbosses?

00:43:56.838 --> 00:43:58.950
And my primary answer
is, well, the assessment.

00:43:58.950 --> 00:44:00.290
I can help you with that.

00:44:00.290 --> 00:44:01.890
But I know that's not enough.

00:44:01.890 --> 00:44:04.750
And then I said, well,
you know, maybe-- I

00:44:04.750 --> 00:44:08.850
forgot who asked the
question-- but when there's

00:44:08.850 --> 00:44:11.520
a team that has a revolving
door versus a team where

00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:14.200
as soon as there's an opening,
it gets closed quickly.

00:44:14.200 --> 00:44:16.560
You can track that type of data.

00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:17.920
That's something.

00:44:17.920 --> 00:44:20.010
You look at financial
performance, presumably.

00:44:20.010 --> 00:44:22.000
Maybe you can count
how many people

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:24.800
have gone on to bigger jobs
as a percentage over time

00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:26.265
or some such thing.

00:44:26.265 --> 00:44:27.890
But I haven't gotten
further than that.

00:44:27.890 --> 00:44:30.820
So just off the top of your
head, were there any thoughts?

00:44:30.820 --> 00:44:36.100
AUDIENCE: I assume that if
the progression of people

00:44:36.100 --> 00:44:39.870
into superbosses as they're
being mentored and apprenticed

00:44:39.870 --> 00:44:43.870
follows a given pattern that the
org chart of the organization

00:44:43.870 --> 00:44:46.185
would reflect that over time.

00:44:46.185 --> 00:44:47.560
SYDNEY FINKELSTEIN:
The org chart

00:44:47.560 --> 00:44:49.980
would reflect what exactly?

00:44:49.980 --> 00:44:53.170
AUDIENCE: So if the
people in control

00:44:53.170 --> 00:44:56.500
are raising up-- giving
big opportunities to people

00:44:56.500 --> 00:44:59.380
underneath them and
raising up more people that

00:44:59.380 --> 00:45:02.470
can take on larger
portions of the business,

00:45:02.470 --> 00:45:05.150
I'd think that the org chart
might be flatter at the higher

00:45:05.150 --> 00:45:09.020
levels or maybe take
on some other form that

00:45:09.020 --> 00:45:11.526
could be identified
versus someone who

00:45:11.526 --> 00:45:12.900
may be very good
at the business,

00:45:12.900 --> 00:45:15.470
but is not delegating, not
bringing up people under them.

00:45:15.470 --> 00:45:16.150
SYDNEY FINKELSTEIN:
That's possible.

00:45:16.150 --> 00:45:19.240
It's true that one of the other
characteristics of superbosses

00:45:19.240 --> 00:45:21.920
is they hate-- maybe
everybody hates bureaucracy

00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:24.710
and hierarchy-- but they just
whack away at it constantly

00:45:24.710 --> 00:45:27.824
because they want to be
with people doing real work.

00:45:27.824 --> 00:45:29.490
They don't want to
have multiple layers.

00:45:29.490 --> 00:45:32.350
I know that's a
Google thing as well.

00:45:32.350 --> 00:45:34.760
AUDIENCE: So many
companies have, like,

00:45:34.760 --> 00:45:38.790
the 360 review or manager
surveys during the year.

00:45:38.790 --> 00:45:41.230
And so I think it's about
aligning those metrics.

00:45:41.230 --> 00:45:44.180
So you could do case
studies on certain companies

00:45:44.180 --> 00:45:47.530
where the things that they're
asking the understudies--

00:45:47.530 --> 00:45:50.880
and, I guess, the bosses--
about are aligned with what

00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:52.720
you've identified in your book.

00:45:52.720 --> 00:45:56.000
And then, if they're graded this
way, then you can quantify it.

00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:58.500
SYDNEY FINKELSTEIN: So it's
part of the internal measurement

00:45:58.500 --> 00:46:00.520
or metrics of whether
you're a good manager.

00:46:00.520 --> 00:46:00.760
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:46:00.760 --> 00:46:01.340
SYDNEY FINKELSTEIN: Yeah.

00:46:01.340 --> 00:46:03.340
AUDIENCE: And you can
work with those companies,

00:46:03.340 --> 00:46:06.570
I guess, like Oracle or
whoever, to try that.

00:46:06.570 --> 00:46:08.332
SYDNEY FINKELSTEIN:
Mm-hmm, good.

00:46:08.332 --> 00:46:09.790
AUDIENCE: To your
question, did you

00:46:09.790 --> 00:46:12.900
come across any situations in
which you interviewed people

00:46:12.900 --> 00:46:16.220
who you considered to be
superbosses who describe

00:46:16.220 --> 00:46:19.670
past scenarios in which the
kind of institutional structure

00:46:19.670 --> 00:46:24.360
of where they were was limiting
of their superboss potentials,

00:46:24.360 --> 00:46:26.710
for instance, and then they
left to go somewhere else?

00:46:26.710 --> 00:46:29.970
Because I came from the world
of government and politics,

00:46:29.970 --> 00:46:32.050
where bureaucracy is very rigid.

00:46:32.050 --> 00:46:33.960
And it makes it very
difficult for people

00:46:33.960 --> 00:46:37.500
who are even charismatic
leaders to have that involvement

00:46:37.500 --> 00:46:38.539
with their staff.

00:46:38.539 --> 00:46:40.580
And then you see a lot of
trends of people moving

00:46:40.580 --> 00:46:42.830
to, for instance, the tech
industry, where things

00:46:42.830 --> 00:46:45.190
are a lot more open and flat.

00:46:45.190 --> 00:46:47.802
Do you encounter that in
your interviews at all?

00:46:47.802 --> 00:46:49.510
SYDNEY FINKELSTEIN:
More for the proteges

00:46:49.510 --> 00:46:51.140
than the actual
superbosses, who are

00:46:51.140 --> 00:46:53.700
some of these legendary people.

00:46:53.700 --> 00:46:55.855
Proteges have done a
bunch of different things.

00:46:55.855 --> 00:47:00.240
Yeah, there was some
movement towards that.

00:47:00.240 --> 00:47:04.814
And maybe that's a reflection
of-- certain cultures,

00:47:04.814 --> 00:47:06.730
if you will-- or structures,
in your example--

00:47:06.730 --> 00:47:10.150
are more amenable to superboss
approaches and techniques.

00:47:10.150 --> 00:47:12.540
And others are less so,
which I think is right.

00:47:12.540 --> 00:47:13.910
I think that's right.

00:47:13.910 --> 00:47:15.430
AUDIENCE: In the
tech industry, I

00:47:15.430 --> 00:47:19.830
would say that stints
can be shorter.

00:47:19.830 --> 00:47:21.840
And we see a lot
of that is in-- so

00:47:21.840 --> 00:47:26.260
who follows the person when
the person leaves and goes

00:47:26.260 --> 00:47:27.180
on to a new venture?

00:47:27.180 --> 00:47:29.860
So like, kind of measuring
and looking at follow-up--

00:47:29.860 --> 00:47:31.520
SYDNEY FINKELSTEIN: Are you
bringing your team with you?

00:47:31.520 --> 00:47:32.311
That type of thing.

00:47:32.311 --> 00:47:34.760
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so we see
a lot of like, for example,

00:47:34.760 --> 00:47:37.600
we've seen a lot of it with
Sheryl going to Facebook

00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:41.160
and then pulling-- eventually,
once the non-compete runs out--

00:47:41.160 --> 00:47:44.830
pulling a number of people
with her or others, right?

00:47:44.830 --> 00:47:46.370
We see a lot of that.

00:47:46.370 --> 00:47:49.840
And they kind of end up
assembling a similar team

00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:50.640
underneath them.

00:47:50.640 --> 00:47:52.300
SYDNEY FINKELSTEIN:
Right, right.

00:47:52.300 --> 00:47:55.690
We'll end on my favorite--
one of my favorite stories.

00:47:55.690 --> 00:47:57.990
I can't say my favorite
because they're all my babies.

00:47:57.990 --> 00:47:59.310
They're all favorites.

00:47:59.310 --> 00:48:02.900
So one of the superbosses--
I don't profile him

00:48:02.900 --> 00:48:05.870
in very much detail even though
I did a big study of him--

00:48:05.870 --> 00:48:08.417
is Robert Mondavi
from, of course,

00:48:08.417 --> 00:48:09.500
the wine business in Napa.

00:48:09.500 --> 00:48:12.300
He created, essentially,
the US wine business.

00:48:12.300 --> 00:48:14.242
Almost-- not almost
everyone, but a lot

00:48:14.242 --> 00:48:16.450
of people that became
successful in the wine business

00:48:16.450 --> 00:48:19.510
at some point worked for him
and were influenced by him.

00:48:19.510 --> 00:48:23.210
And so a couple-- two or
three years ago, or maybe

00:48:23.210 --> 00:48:26.150
four or five years ago--
one of my consulting clients

00:48:26.150 --> 00:48:27.860
is a company called
Constellation Brands.

00:48:27.860 --> 00:48:30.760
It's the world's biggest
spirits and wine company.

00:48:33.560 --> 00:48:34.560
They're gigantic.

00:48:34.560 --> 00:48:37.020
And they bought the Mondavi
company probably 10 years

00:48:37.020 --> 00:48:40.780
earlier, when he was retired.

00:48:40.780 --> 00:48:43.130
And so we did an
all-day retreat in Napa.

00:48:43.130 --> 00:48:45.820
And the top 40 executives
from around the world

00:48:45.820 --> 00:48:47.110
from this company came in.

00:48:47.110 --> 00:48:49.920
And we were spending the day
doing what you do in retreats.

00:48:49.920 --> 00:48:53.672
And the dinner was going to
be at the Mondavi Ranch, which

00:48:53.672 --> 00:48:54.880
they owned, of course, right?

00:48:54.880 --> 00:48:57.070
And they invited Mr.
Mondavi and his wife

00:48:57.070 --> 00:48:58.770
to dinner, which was nice.

00:48:58.770 --> 00:48:59.820
He was long retired.

00:48:59.820 --> 00:49:00.800
And so he came.

00:49:00.800 --> 00:49:02.620
And he was in a wheelchair.

00:49:02.620 --> 00:49:04.970
He was 94, I believe.

00:49:04.970 --> 00:49:07.880
And he didn't say anything.

00:49:07.880 --> 00:49:09.630
It wasn't clear what
he understood or not.

00:49:09.630 --> 00:49:11.004
I mean, he was
dressed in a suit.

00:49:11.004 --> 00:49:12.420
His wife had to help him eat.

00:49:12.420 --> 00:49:14.920
He obviously was
struggling a little bit

00:49:14.920 --> 00:49:16.870
at that stage of life.

00:49:16.870 --> 00:49:19.710
And I happened to be seated
at the same table as him.

00:49:19.710 --> 00:49:23.530
And as dinner is
about to begin, I

00:49:23.530 --> 00:49:26.960
noticed a couple of the senior
executives from Constellation

00:49:26.960 --> 00:49:29.390
start walking towards our
table from another table.

00:49:29.390 --> 00:49:31.389
And they're going
towards Mr. Mondavi.

00:49:31.389 --> 00:49:33.055
And the next thing I
know I turn around,

00:49:33.055 --> 00:49:35.710
and I realize there's like,
a line of 20 people waiting

00:49:35.710 --> 00:49:37.850
their turn to talk
to Mr. Mondavi.

00:49:37.850 --> 00:49:39.299
And you have to picture this.

00:49:39.299 --> 00:49:40.840
So he's in a
wheelchair, so they have

00:49:40.840 --> 00:49:43.980
to kind of kneel down a little
bit to make eye contact.

00:49:43.980 --> 00:49:45.600
And you know what they say?

00:49:45.600 --> 00:49:48.459
Almost without exception,
they say, thank you.

00:49:48.459 --> 00:49:49.750
Thank you for what you've done.

00:49:49.750 --> 00:49:51.166
Thank you for what
you've created.

00:49:51.166 --> 00:49:53.260
Thank you for creating
this incredible opportunity

00:49:53.260 --> 00:49:55.590
that I've been able
to be part of this

00:49:55.590 --> 00:49:59.470
and create a livelihood
for my family and all that

00:49:59.470 --> 00:50:01.732
you-- and he--
one after another,

00:50:01.732 --> 00:50:02.690
the same type of thing.

00:50:02.690 --> 00:50:04.940
It was really-- you see
that, you don't forget that.

00:50:04.940 --> 00:50:06.660
And he never said a word.

00:50:06.660 --> 00:50:08.170
He didn't say anything.

00:50:08.170 --> 00:50:10.420
And I don't know whether he
really understood or not.

00:50:10.420 --> 00:50:12.230
But his eyes were sparkling.

00:50:12.230 --> 00:50:14.280
So I like to think
he understood.

00:50:14.280 --> 00:50:17.069
And that's legacy, isn't it?

00:50:17.069 --> 00:50:18.610
I mean, that's an
unbelievable thing.

00:50:18.610 --> 00:50:20.390
When all is said
and done, are we--

00:50:20.390 --> 00:50:22.310
each of us-- going
to have people

00:50:22.310 --> 00:50:24.826
that have been
influenced, where we

00:50:24.826 --> 00:50:26.950
have been able to change
their lives for the better

00:50:26.950 --> 00:50:29.860
in some way, that's a really
powerful thing that goes way

00:50:29.860 --> 00:50:32.910
beyond wealth and
many other things.

00:50:32.910 --> 00:50:34.890
And superbosses have done it.

00:50:34.890 --> 00:50:36.490
Superbosses have done it.

00:50:36.490 --> 00:50:39.200
And I think any one of
us have that opportunity

00:50:39.200 --> 00:50:40.420
to be able to do that.

00:50:40.420 --> 00:50:41.924
So thank you very much.

00:50:41.924 --> 00:50:42.840
Good luck to everyone.

00:50:42.840 --> 00:50:45.957
I hope to see many more
superbosses here again.

00:50:45.957 --> 00:50:46.790
Thank you very much.

00:50:46.790 --> 00:50:47.990
[APPLAUSE]

00:50:47.990 --> 00:50:48.890
Thank you.

00:50:48.890 --> 00:50:50.440
Thank you.
