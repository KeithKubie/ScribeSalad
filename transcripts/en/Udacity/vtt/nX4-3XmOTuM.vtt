00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Well, the average is just 1.97, the same average as before, and the deviation--

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
well, we add up how far each of these deviate from 1.97.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000
This one deviates by 0, 0.01 and also a 0.01 because remember we take absolute values.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Now, if we take the average of these three numbers, we get about 0.01 and again,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I've rounded up from 0.0066667, but this is clearly a much smaller error and I trust this number

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
1.97 much more than I trust the 2.

00:00:30.000 --> 99:59:59.000
The lesson here--beware of green-haired doctors.
