00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:13.360
&gt;&gt; Let me press you on that a little further
since you have an -- a Y

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:18.960
chromosome here.
And I think there might be some men watching

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.599
whether here or on YouTube
who will think hey, you know, this isn't my

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:26.849
fight.
I don't have a clitoris.

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:32.029
And what end -- and the same thing, I think,
applies to a lot of other

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:36.250
women's rights issues.
Um, what do you say to them?

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:37.490
Is this their fight or not?

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:42.980
&gt;&gt; Oh, absolutely, it is their fight.
If they care at all about human rights, about

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:44.420
their own freedom, and
their own dignity.

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.510
I mean, I think that was my point about the
linkage between the fight

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:51.650
for women's rights and the fight for all human
rights.

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:59.150
I mean, it's not -- we all can very easily
draw the connections between

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:03.710
the status of women in any particular society
and the general status of

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.920
human rights in that society.
And that includes the societies in which many

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:15.850
of the people who are
watching this, um, discussion live.

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:21.270
Insofar as -- and it's the experience of my
own, my own life and my own

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:27.290
organization that it was the struggle of women
for their rights that

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:31.640
made us understand our own, our own rights
and the way things are

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.420
connected, and the way that -- the approach
that we were taking was a

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:43.729
very narrow and very limited approach.
So I think it's in the vital interest of every

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:49.090
man and we, of course,
don't live in isolation from women.

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.200
You know, we have daughters, we have wives,
we have lovers.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.790
We -- you know, it's inconceivable to me that
someone could say this is

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.500
not of any interest to me because I'm male
and this happens to women,

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.470
any more than I would expect women to say,
I'm not really interested in

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:06.350
what happened to Nelson Mandela because he's
a man and I'm a woman.

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.649
I mean what kind of world is that where we
suddenly divide our

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:11.649
feelings?

00:02:11.649 --> 00:02:15.370
&gt;&gt; Maybe one more way of thinking about it
is that the Holocaust wasn't

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.541
a Jewish issue civil rights weren't a black
issue and FGM isn't just a

00:02:19.541 --> 00:02:20.541
women's issue.

00:02:20.541 --> 00:02:21.541
&gt;&gt; Right. Exactly.

00:02:21.541 --> 00:02:25.921
&gt;&gt; And I think particularly, men play such
a huge part in the

00:02:25.921 --> 00:02:29.540
communities that practice this as Anna said
because one of the key

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.540
reasons for FGM being in place is it makes
a girl marriageable.

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.810
And when, as part of these community conversations,
the men come

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:43.390
together and decide that they will marry an
uncut woman, this is how it

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.500
changes within a generation.
And you then move though to the next community

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.750
which is the
intra-marrying group.

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:54.000
So men are so vital in this debate and particularly
as religious

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.480
leaders as well.

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.569
&gt;&gt; And I think when we focus on rights, we
get stuck.

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:02.100
When we focus on economics, which is really
what this all comes down to

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:06.550
is kind of what's a girl worth and is this
about marrying her for her

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:11.090
value -- it changes.
I think because it's girls, people do react

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.599
differently than women.
So I think that's going to help bring more

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:17.650
people to the issue.
We've used economic incentives in a number

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.410
of cases to get communities
to think differently about early marriage.

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:25.760
And the consequence of the man finally having
a reason to stop and

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:30.470
think about his daughter marrying early or
marrying late, when there's

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:35.430
an economic incentive to do so.
And in the case, in Ethiopia, a girl who stays

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:40.530
in school is eligible
for a sheep or a goat for her family if she

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.319
stays in school two more
years.

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:47.879
The fathers have been saying, hmmm, I wasn't
really in the conversation

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:49.780
before.
I had no reason to have the conversation.

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.000
I had no reason to think about it.
I had no reason to think about the value my

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.730
daughter could bring to my
family if she stayed in school longer.

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:02.680
The economic incentive got him to pay attention.
So I'm for the hybrid solution, which is the

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:07.440
community, the listening,
incentives where we can -- where we can apply

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.409
them.
And I know not everybody loves incentives

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:13.810
but I think they work and the
external pressure.
