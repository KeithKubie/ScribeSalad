00:00:00.243 --> 00:00:04.123
- Let's say that I run a company

00:00:04.123 --> 00:00:06.749
that is based inside of the United States.

00:00:06.749 --> 00:00:09.563
So this right over here is my company.

00:00:09.563 --> 00:00:12.736
Maybe I have some
smokestacks of some kind.

00:00:12.736 --> 00:00:14.283
So that is my company,

00:00:14.283 --> 00:00:17.770
and it makes a million
dollars in pre-tax profits.

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:21.336
One million dollars,
and this is before tax.

00:00:21.336 --> 00:00:23.575
So, pre-tax profits.

00:00:23.575 --> 00:00:25.406
And let's say that the
country that I'm in,

00:00:25.406 --> 00:00:27.323
and the way I've drawn it,
this is the United States,

00:00:27.323 --> 00:00:30.263
let's say at the time that
I make those pre-tax profits

00:00:30.263 --> 00:00:35.263
the corporate tax rate
is 35%, 35% tax rate.

00:00:36.423 --> 00:00:38.243
So, it's pretty
straightforward to think about

00:00:38.243 --> 00:00:40.303
how much taxes I would have to pay.

00:00:40.303 --> 00:00:43.703
I would pay 35% on this
one million dollars,

00:00:43.703 --> 00:00:47.403
or essentially I would
pay $350,000 in taxes.

00:00:47.403 --> 00:00:52.023
Three-hundred and fifty
thousand dollars in taxes,

00:00:52.023 --> 00:00:55.546
and I would have 650,000 left in profit.

00:00:55.546 --> 00:01:00.546
So, 650,000 left in profit.

00:01:00.823 --> 00:01:02.163
Now what I want to think about,

00:01:02.163 --> 00:01:04.743
let's say my company wants to
get a little bit more creative

00:01:04.743 --> 00:01:07.263
about how it might save on taxes.

00:01:07.263 --> 00:01:09.723
So what it does is, it
realizes that there's an island

00:01:09.723 --> 00:01:11.683
not too far off the U.S. Coast,

00:01:11.683 --> 00:01:13.199
and there are actually several of them,

00:01:13.199 --> 00:01:16.295
that has a substantively lower tax rate.

00:01:16.295 --> 00:01:17.543
And I'm just picking it arbitrarily,

00:01:17.543 --> 00:01:22.543
but let's say it has a 5%
corporate tax rate, 5% tax rate.

00:01:25.083 --> 00:01:27.165
So how can this company,
which is physically

00:01:27.165 --> 00:01:29.383
or for the most part
based in this country,

00:01:29.383 --> 00:01:32.483
somehow benefit from this lower tax rate

00:01:32.483 --> 00:01:34.723
that is happening offshore?

00:01:34.723 --> 00:01:36.196
Well, what they'll typically do is

00:01:36.196 --> 00:01:37.923
set up another subsidiary,

00:01:37.923 --> 00:01:40.043
one that this company owns and controls,

00:01:40.043 --> 00:01:43.443
but it is set up in this
little island nation.

00:01:43.443 --> 00:01:45.756
So let's set it up right over here.

00:01:45.756 --> 00:01:47.067
So that's the other company.

00:01:47.067 --> 00:01:48.843
And what it'll do is,
it'll tend to give it maybe

00:01:48.843 --> 00:01:51.403
often times it'll give it
some intellectual property,

00:01:51.403 --> 00:01:54.123
maybe patents, trademarks,
things like this.

00:01:54.123 --> 00:01:56.063
So it gets all of the
intellectual property

00:01:56.063 --> 00:01:57.181
of the parent company.

00:01:57.181 --> 00:02:02.181
So, given the intellectual property.

00:02:03.363 --> 00:02:04.803
And then, what it can say is--

00:02:04.803 --> 00:02:07.784
And this is owned by the parent entity,

00:02:07.784 --> 00:02:09.066
so I'll draw a little dotted line here.

00:02:09.066 --> 00:02:12.035
It's owned and controlled by this company

00:02:12.035 --> 00:02:14.869
that's based in the U.S.,
and what they'll say is,

00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:16.912
look, we don't have a million
dollar pre-tax profit anymore,

00:02:16.912 --> 00:02:19.969
because we had to
essentially license the use

00:02:19.969 --> 00:02:23.444
of this intellectual property,

00:02:23.444 --> 00:02:26.949
whether it's trademarks,
copyrights, patents,

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:29.021
we've got to pay this
entity right over here

00:02:29.021 --> 00:02:32.449
some amount of money to use
that intellectual property.

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:33.504
So let's say that they say,

00:02:33.504 --> 00:02:38.424
we're going to pay them,
I don't know, $800,000,

00:02:38.424 --> 00:02:40.429
and this is essentially transfer pricing.

00:02:40.429 --> 00:02:43.215
In theory, there should
be a way of deciding

00:02:43.215 --> 00:02:46.249
what is the fair rate for
that intellectual property,

00:02:46.249 --> 00:02:48.896
but often times that intellectual
property is fairly unique,

00:02:48.896 --> 00:02:50.809
so it's hard to determine a market rate,

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:52.309
which really just leaves this company

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:54.029
to decide it for itself.

00:02:54.029 --> 00:02:56.809
So let's go into that reality,

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:58.956
where instead of this reality,

00:02:58.956 --> 00:03:02.524
this company, before it had
a million in pre-tax profits,

00:03:02.524 --> 00:03:06.161
but now it's paying 800,000
in royalties and licensing

00:03:06.161 --> 00:03:08.001
to this entity right over here.

00:03:08.001 --> 00:03:13.001
So out of that one million, you
have 800,000 going offshore.

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:18.356
You have 800,000 goes offshore.

00:03:18.356 --> 00:03:21.210
And so, the real pre-tax
profit for this company now,

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:23.489
based on accounting for it this way,

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:26.969
based on paying this
subsidiary that's offshore

00:03:26.969 --> 00:03:30.049
for use of the intellectual property,

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:35.049
the company now has 200K
in pre-tax profits, 200K.

00:03:37.223 --> 00:03:39.604
So that was before the licensing.

00:03:39.604 --> 00:03:41.090
Now this is after the licensing.

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.589
This is the new pre-tax number.

00:03:43.589 --> 00:03:45.645
This is the new pre-tax number.

00:03:45.645 --> 00:03:50.613
And so in the U.S., it would
only pay 35% of the $200,000.

00:03:50.613 --> 00:03:53.709
Instead of paying $350,000 in taxes,

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:55.489
it would now pay--

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:57.575
So it's no longer 350 in taxes.

00:03:57.575 --> 00:04:02.575
Thirty-five percent of 200K
is 70K in taxes, 70K in taxes,

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:07.149
and the U.S., I guess you
could say parent company,

00:04:07.149 --> 00:04:12.149
would show a profit of 200K
minus the 70K of $130,000.

00:04:13.389 --> 00:04:17.115
So, 130,000, I would call it net profit,

00:04:17.115 --> 00:04:20.409
or we could say post-tax profit.

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:21.969
And then, this character right over here,

00:04:21.969 --> 00:04:23.335
let's say it has very minimal costs.

00:04:23.335 --> 00:04:25.588
Let's say it has no
costs, for simplification.

00:04:25.588 --> 00:04:27.989
It would have some, to do some paperwork.

00:04:27.989 --> 00:04:29.941
All of this would essentially be profit.

00:04:29.941 --> 00:04:32.116
Maybe have a few thousand
dollars in costs,

00:04:32.116 --> 00:04:34.116
but we'll ignore that for now.

00:04:34.116 --> 00:04:36.329
So all of this would
be its pre-tax profit.

00:04:36.329 --> 00:04:38.533
It would have to pay 5% of it.

00:04:38.533 --> 00:04:42.329
Five percent in taxes to
this country right over here.

00:04:42.329 --> 00:04:46.509
So 5% of 800,000 is $40,000.

00:04:46.509 --> 00:04:49.107
So it would pay 40,000 in taxes

00:04:49.107 --> 00:04:52.732
to the government of this
island right over here,

00:04:52.732 --> 00:04:57.049
and then it would be left
with the remainder, $760,000.

00:04:57.049 --> 00:05:00.192
So, it would have 760,000.

00:05:00.192 --> 00:05:02.384
I guess you could call
that it's net profit,

00:05:02.384 --> 00:05:06.629
after paying taxes, net profit.

00:05:06.629 --> 00:05:08.409
So you can see here the company saved

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:10.389
substantially on taxes.

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:14.169
It paid 70,000 in the
U.S. and 40,000 abroad.

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:17.069
So it paid a total of 110,000 in taxes

00:05:17.069 --> 00:05:20.669
versus the 350,000 it
would have had to pay

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:24.882
if it was based purely,
purely in the United States.

00:05:24.882 --> 00:05:26.929
So you might say, hey,
this is a great thing.

00:05:26.929 --> 00:05:29.849
Companies, why even have
an 800,000 transfer price?

00:05:29.849 --> 00:05:30.653
Why not do a million?

00:05:30.653 --> 00:05:33.809
And, obviously, if you do it
a little bit too ridiculously,

00:05:33.809 --> 00:05:35.341
it'll get more and more scrutiny.

00:05:35.341 --> 00:05:38.412
So there's some balancing influence there,

00:05:38.412 --> 00:05:39.804
and obviously if there is a market

00:05:39.804 --> 00:05:41.282
for this intellectual property

00:05:41.282 --> 00:05:43.329
or that type of intellectual property,

00:05:43.329 --> 00:05:45.189
or if you are licensing to other people,

00:05:45.189 --> 00:05:46.739
that might dictate what this is,

00:05:46.739 --> 00:05:49.529
but you might say, why
not do this night and day?

00:05:49.529 --> 00:05:51.649
Well, the question is,
you now have this profit,

00:05:51.649 --> 00:05:53.964
and it might be in the form of cash.

00:05:53.964 --> 00:05:56.609
We go into other videos in more
depth when it might not be.

00:05:56.609 --> 00:05:58.289
But you have essentially this profit,

00:05:58.289 --> 00:06:00.589
but you won't be able to get
it back into the United States

00:06:00.589 --> 00:06:02.909
without paying a tax on it.

00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:04.219
So if you want to get it
back in the United States,

00:06:04.219 --> 00:06:05.387
and that's actually the check.

00:06:05.387 --> 00:06:09.829
The reason why we do tax
repatriation of funds

00:06:09.829 --> 00:06:12.369
is so that companies can't
do this night and day,

00:06:12.369 --> 00:06:13.973
essentially transfer profits abroad

00:06:13.973 --> 00:06:15.909
and then bring the cash back in.

00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:17.849
In order to close this loophole,

00:06:17.849 --> 00:06:22.849
that's why the repatriation of these funds

00:06:23.679 --> 00:06:25.532
are actually taxed.

00:06:25.532 --> 00:06:26.432
And I'll let you think about,

00:06:26.432 --> 00:06:27.344
and it obviously depends on

00:06:27.344 --> 00:06:30.012
what the transfer prices
are and things like that,

00:06:30.012 --> 00:06:33.692
but essentially what this
tax rate would have to be

00:06:33.692 --> 00:06:36.627
in order for a company
to come out neutral.

00:06:36.627 --> 00:06:38.232
And there's other ways
of getting around it,

00:06:38.232 --> 00:06:39.862
and I'll do other videos later,

00:06:39.862 --> 00:06:43.412
of ways that this cash can be put to use,

00:06:43.412 --> 00:06:45.812
and it still is not actually taxed.
