00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.600
- [Instructor] Alright,
now lets tackle part B.

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.370
Find the average velocity of the particle

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:09.080
for the time period from zero is less than

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:11.400
or equal to t is less
than or equal to six.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.460
So our average velocity,

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.480
that's just going to be
our change in position,

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.200
which we could view as our displacement,

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.600
divided by our change in time.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.080
Well, what is our change
in position going to be?

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.830
Well they don't give us
our position function

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.070
but they do give us our velocity function.

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.870
And so to figure out the average velocity,

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:36.820
we could figure out our displacement,

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.810
which is going to be equal to
the integral of our velocity.

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:43.222
The integral of v of t, dt.

00:00:43.222 --> 00:00:46.490
And we wanna find the average
velocity for this time period.

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:49.760
So we're gonna go t equals
zero to t equals six

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.630
and then we're going to divide that

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:53.310
by the amount of time that goes by.

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:56.300
Well our change in time is
going to be equal to six

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.850
and so, this is going to be
equal to the integral from

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:00.930
zero

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.640
to six

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.210
of

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:05.970
two sine

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.370
of e to the t

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:10.040
over four power plus one,

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:10.970
dt

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.740
and then all of that divided by six.

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:14.830
Where did I get this from?

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:15.663
Well they tell us,

00:01:15.663 --> 00:01:17.500
what our velocity as
a function of time is,

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:18.910
its that right over there.

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:22.220
So we can get our calculator
out to solve this part.

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.400
So on our calculator we would hit math

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.050
and then we would wanna do number 9

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:30.560
which is definite
integral, so I'll hit nine.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.440
And we are going to go from zero

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:34.410
to

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:35.830
six

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:36.920
of,

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.680
this is going to be two sine

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:40.770
of

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.520
e to the..

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:43.520
So let me do,

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.050
second e

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:47.090
to the

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.110
And I'll just use the
variable x instead of t

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.610
cause its easier to type in.

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.600
X divided by four power,

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:54.991
so that's my sine

00:01:54.991 --> 00:01:58.140
and then let me close the
parentheses for the sine,

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.250
plus one and then I'm integrating
here with the respect to x

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.720
just cause it was more convenient.

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.990
And I am going to get that,
and then I divide by six.

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:09.310
Divide by six.

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:10.370
And I get

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:12.430
And when you're taking an AP Calculus exam

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.900
its important to round
to three decimal places

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.380
unless they tell you otherwise,
that's what they expect.

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:22.380
So its approximately equal
to one point nine four nine.

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.100
Approximately one point nine four nine.

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.490
Now lets do part C.

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:30.150
So part C

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.650
Find the total distance traveled

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.650
by the particle from time t
equals zero to t equals six.

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.830
So you might say, hey didn't
we just figure that out?

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.050
No, this is displacement.

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.200
And to remember the
difference between distance

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.850
and displacement, if I have
something that starts here,

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:48.470
it goes over there

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.430
and then it comes back
to right over there.

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.460
The distance traveled
is the total path length

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:57.096
so it would be that, plus this.

00:02:57.096 --> 00:03:00.610
While the displacement would
just be this right over here.

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.360
So if you wanna figure out distance,

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.700
what you wanna do is take the integral

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.040
of the absolute value of velocity,

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.950
you could think about it as you're

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.430
taking the integral of the speed function.

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.350
So this is just going to be the integral

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:15.910
from zero to six of the absolute value

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:17.943
of v of t,

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:19.870
dt.

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:21.760
And then we can type this,

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.060
actually let me just write it out,

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:24.110
since you would wanna do this

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:25.680
if you're actually taking the test.

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.690
So its the integral
from zero to six of the

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:32.690
absolute value of two sine
of e to the t over four,

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:34.103
plus one.

00:03:35.063 --> 00:03:37.900
Close the absolute value, dt.

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.230
Which is going to be
approximately equal to...

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:44.530
So once again, we hit
math, definite integral.

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:46.830
We're going from zero

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:48.540
to six

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:49.590
of...

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:52.410
Now we'll hit math again,

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:56.330
and then we'll go to number,
we see absolute value.

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:58.940
The absolute value of

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:00.930
two sine

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.370
of

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:05.400
e to the, I'll use x again

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.890
just cause its easier to
use on the calculator.

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:11.130
And then I'll close the parentheses on...

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:13.860
Whoops, let me make sure I do this right.

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:17.010
So let me close the
parenthases on the sine

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:20.120
and then I have plus one

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.600
and then there ya go.

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:26.073
And then I'm integrating
with respect to x.

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:32.530
Approximately twelve
point five seven three.

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:35.010
Now lets do part d.

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:36.020
I'll do it right over here.

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:37.180
Part d.

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:38.880
For t between zero

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.080
and six the particle changes
direction exactly once.

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:46.020
Find the position of the
particle at that time.

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:47.070
So the way that I'm gonna tackle it

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:49.300
is first I need to
think about at what time

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.220
does the particle change direction

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:54.240
and then, I can figure out its position

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.430
by taking the integral
of the velocity function.

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:58.840
So how do I think about where

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.020
that particle changes direction?

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:02.560
Well you're going to change direction

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.810
if your velocity is at zero

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:07.000
and right before that
your velocity was positive

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.070
and then right after that
your velocity is negative

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:09.940
or the other way around,

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:11.550
right before that your
velocity was negative

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:15.010
and then your velocity right
after that is positive.

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:17.490
So we just have to figure out
when does v of t equal zero?

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:22.490
So lets just say two sine
of e to the t over four,

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:25.570
plus one, is equal to zero.

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:27.660
And there's multiple
ways you can solve this,

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:28.880
but because we're allowed to use

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:31.490
the calculator we might as well do that.

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:33.160
So we hit math.

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:35.140
And then we hit B right over there,

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:36.400
I'll just hit enter.

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:37.910
Equation solver.

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:38.790
So I could just say,

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:43.740
look the left side of my
equation is two sine of,

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:46.530
we are going to go e to the,

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:49.170
I'll just use x as what I'm solving for

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:52.170
cause its easier to type
in, in the calculator.

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:55.270
And close that parentheses, plus one.

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:58.210
The right hand side is equal to zero.

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:00.600
And now I just have to
give an initial guess

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:02.550
and I'll just go right
in between that interval

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:04.550
between t equals zero and t equals six,

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:06.200
so I'll just put a three right over there.

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:07.490
And now I just need to solve it

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:12.130
and I can do that by hitting
alpha and then solve.

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:17.130
And then you see, it got us
to five point one nine six.

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:22.860
So, t is approximately equal
to five point one nine six.

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:25.670
But remember, they're not asking us for

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:28.030
at what time does the
particle change direction.

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:28.863
They wanna know,

00:06:28.863 --> 00:06:31.410
what's the position of
the particle at that time.

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:34.040
Well we know how to find
our change in position,

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:36.840
our change in position is
going to be our displacement

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:38.940
from time equals zero

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:42.760
to time five point one nine six

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:43.730
and the displacement,

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:45.500
we're integrating the velocity function.

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:49.345
So that's going to be two sine of

00:06:49.345 --> 00:06:52.020
e to the t over four,

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:53.940
plus one, dt.

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:56.420
Now this is going to be
our change in position,

00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:57.830
but where did we start?

00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:59.720
Well they say at x equals zero,

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:02.940
or at time zero our position was two.

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:05.610
So this is our change,
we would start here,

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:07.640
this would give us our total position.

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:09.680
Where we started plus our change.

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:13.930
And so this is going to be
approximately equal to...

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:16.790
We are going to have two plus

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:20.610
and then I go to math, definite integral,

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:22.340
from zero

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:26.390
to five point one nine six

00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:28.830
and I've typed this in many times already.

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:30.900
Two sine

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:33.320
of e,

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:35.500
of e,

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:39.850
to the x divided by four power

00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:41.730
and then close that parentheses.

00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:46.730
Plus one, and then I'm
integrating with respect to x

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:49.690
and so this gives us,

00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:53.000
fourteen point one three five.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.670
Approximately fourteen
point one three five,

00:07:56.670 --> 00:07:57.640
is its position.

00:07:57.640 --> 00:07:58.860
And let me make sure that I put

00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:00.720
those parentheses there
in the right place.

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:02.653
And we are done.
