00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:08.147
AARON ADERS: Hi, everybody.

00:00:08.147 --> 00:00:09.230
Thanks for having me here.

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:10.605
I just want to
say, first of all,

00:00:10.605 --> 00:00:12.100
I'm truly honored to be here.

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:15.340
This is really cool to talk to
so many awesome, smart people

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:20.466
and to be the company that I've
watched, you know, as a fan

00:00:20.466 --> 00:00:21.590
almost my whole adult life.

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:23.810
So I just really appreciate it.

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:25.360
My name is Aaron Aders.

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:27.790
I'm the founder of
LEIF Technologies.

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:30.690
And I'm absolutely
obsessed with snowboarding.

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:34.030
There is just something
about that movement

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.890
and that feeling of snowboarding
that's just incredible.

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.860
And it's so incredible that
you've got 39 million people

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.250
around the world spending
$2 billion a year

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.690
to enjoy it for only five
days a year on average,

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:51.970
just five days a year.

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:55.030
Like would you play
basketball five days a year,

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.940
or soccer, or anything else
for just five days a year?

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.250
Maybe, but with snowboarding,
it really is that incredible.

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:02.620
It's that worth it.

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.050
But, obviously, we
have-- a lot of the year,

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:07.530
we're on the sidelines
just hanging out.

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.220
Now, I know a lot of you
might not be snowboarders.

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.040
So what I'm about
to show you, you

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.990
might not grasp
the full reality,

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:15.040
the full gravity of that.

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.680
So if you could just, for a
moment, think about something

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.280
that is an activity that you
can only enjoy five days a year.

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.900
Maybe it's traveling,
like a fishing trip maybe

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.612
or climbing a mountain.

00:01:27.612 --> 00:01:29.320
Think about-- think
about that experience

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:35.570
for a second and those feelings
that you have enjoying this.

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.360
And, now, imagine
if somebody told you

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.760
you can enjoy this experience
and have these feelings

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:45.750
on demand anywhere in the world,
after work, on the weekends,

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:46.950
whenever you want.

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.820
That's basically what we've
done for snowboarders.

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.640
And so what is it
about snowboarding

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.190
that makes it so incredible?

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:01.190
And it's a combination of
speed, and turning, and carving,

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.950
which is leaning
into your carves--

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:05.960
your turns rather.

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.870
But it's this controlled
drift, I think,

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:11.510
that is really that
addicting part.

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.720
And the drift, it's
something that, you know,

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.050
from the first time you ran and
slid across your kitchen floor,

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:21.320
or drifted out the
back tire of your bike

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.530
or your scooter as a
kid, or doing donuts

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.250
around your high
school parking lot,

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.960
there's something just
addicting about that.

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.850
And snowboarding is
really unique because it--

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:35.120
it takes that drift and
puts you in total control,

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.400
and so you can spin,
and you can slide.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.970
And there's really just
nothing else like it.

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.210
And so that is just so unique
to snowboarding and something

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:46.760
that has just never
existed anywhere else.

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.440
Another great thing
about snowboarding

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.290
is that community aspect,
so sharing this adrenaline

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.617
with your friends and going
out and snowboarding with them.

00:02:55.617 --> 00:02:57.950
And sometimes, you know, given
that snowboarding is just

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.200
a five-day-a-year experience,
you might only see these

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.870
friends five days a
year or, at least,

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.591
just enjoying this experience
with them for only five days.

00:03:06.591 --> 00:03:08.090
And so all of these
things together,

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.760
snowboarding can be a little
bit of a frustrating sport

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.710
most of the year.

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:14.530
And so that's what
we set out to change.

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.020
And we are a group
of snowboarders

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:20.200
that all share that dream
of riding all year around.

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.680
And I can tell you
getting to that point

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.320
where we can enjoy the sport
all year round as a snowboarder,

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:29.750
it really is a dream come true.

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:32.240
And so what does it look like?

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:34.390
It's kind of hard to
describe in words,

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:37.720
somebody actually snowboarding
in Dubai or around the world.

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.100
So I'll just show you a quick
video that'll show the--

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.840
the capabilities of the LEIF.

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.820
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.340
So there's a lot going on there.

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:41.540
But, essentially, you can
just think of the LEIF

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:44.810
that we've taken the
mechanics of snowboarding

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:48.890
and traded the potential energy
that a mountain gives you,

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:54.350
mountain slope, and for the
electronic mechanical energy

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:56.570
of electronic motors.

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:59.780
And so really the key
secret sauce to our system

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:02.220
is this 360 drive
that you see here.

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.751
So this is really
a caster wheel just

00:05:04.751 --> 00:05:07.250
like you see on the bottom of
the shopping cart with a motor

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:12.020
strapped to it and transmitting
energy through a slip ring,

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:15.740
and going into a battery pack,
and controlled by your hand.

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:18.680
And so those drive
wheels, the base of it,

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:20.490
are a little bit
lower to the ground.

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:22.970
And you can see in the
tilting and drifting

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:28.190
part the outer edge wheels, they
function just like a snowboard,

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:29.650
so the edges on your snowboard.

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:32.540
And that's really there for
just steering, and control,

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:33.560
and braking.

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:35.240
And the rest is you.

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:38.780
Your whole body controls
this crazy experience just

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:40.070
like a snowboard.

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:42.050
And it's really almost magical.

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:45.080
If you know how to
snowboard, and you

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:48.350
take all of those, that muscle
memory, and that experience,

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:51.360
and you jump on the Leaf, and
you can channel that through,

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:52.580
it just works.

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:57.950
In fact, it only works if you
ride it just like a snowboard.

00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:58.460
So

00:05:58.460 --> 00:05:59.450
How do you stop?

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:00.860
Very important question.

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:04.640
You stop just like a snowboard,
so sliding on your edge wheels

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:07.430
just like you slide on
the edge of a snowboard.

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:10.520
It's the most fun and most
effective way of stopping.

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:13.550
You can go from our top
speed of 23 miles an hour

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:16.970
to a dead stop in less
than two car lengths, which

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:18.857
if you try that on a
bike or something else,

00:06:18.857 --> 00:06:20.690
you might, you know,
go over the handlebars,

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:22.610
but you're leaning into that--

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:24.330
that slide and that force.

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:28.170
So you can stop really hard
and be really comfortable.

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:32.040
So it gives you a lot of control
when you're at top speed.

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:35.220
And you might have noticed there
is these hooks that kind of fit

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:36.390
over your feet.

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:40.860
And this adds a ton of
control, just like a snowboard.

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:44.730
Now with a snowboard, you're
locked on, and so you can't--

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:47.460
there's no safety bailout
for the snowboard.

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:49.300
But you have snow
under you, so it's OK.

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:51.570
But when you're
operating over pavement,

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:55.260
you definitely want to have
the ability to jump off,

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:56.801
and it's funny,
once you-- once you

00:06:56.801 --> 00:06:58.300
get rolling on the
LEIF for a while,

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:00.870
and you go back to
snowboarding, you're

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:04.382
kind of weirdly freaked out by
the ability you can't jump off.

00:07:04.382 --> 00:07:06.840
So it kind of takes a couple
of rounds to get back into it.

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:09.720
But that's a key
feature and a must

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:13.280
for getting out these footholds.

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:16.850
And so on the acceleration,
it's a wireless remote control.

00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:19.670
And so you can think of
this as kind of controlling

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:21.200
your mountain slope.

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:23.390
And so if you have it
all the way forward,

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:25.190
the gas pedal completely
hammered down,

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:28.400
that's like a triple black
diamond, like, dropping in,

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:30.770
just getting off super fast.

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:34.280
Or you can just really lightly
move the controller forward,

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:37.010
and it can be like a
nice bunny hill slope.

00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:39.170
But the nice thing is, is
that at any point in time

00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:42.380
if you get nervous, if you get
a little bit out of control,

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:45.760
you can let go, and the motors
will just coast and eventually

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:47.010
will come to a stop.

00:07:47.010 --> 00:07:49.070
And so, really, it's a
bit like snowboarding,

00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:52.650
but you can make the mountain
go away any time you want.

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:55.940
And then we made the battery
swappable, because if you're

00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:57.740
a snowboarder, even
if you've never

00:07:57.740 --> 00:08:01.040
dreamed about snowboarding
on city streets,

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:03.279
you've definitely dreamed
about the endless slope

00:08:03.279 --> 00:08:05.820
because at some point, you get
to the bottom of the mountain,

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:09.120
which is a total drag because
you have to wait in line,

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:10.850
get in a lift up,
and so you always

00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:12.710
dream about that endless slope.

00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:13.930
And we wanted that ability.

00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:16.010
And so for us the
endless slope is

00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:18.170
getting to the end of
a battery, not having

00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:21.050
to go home and charge it,
but rather just switch out

00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:23.780
another battery and keep going.

00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:26.900
These batteries will go up to
15 miles on our largest size,

00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:28.610
and so far, I
haven't seen anybody

00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:29.870
go past three batteries.

00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:33.909
That's been kind of the human
limit of fun at this point.

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:42.260
Yeah, so before I get into
this part, this project,

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:46.030
I mean, from the beginning,
I mean, the crux of this

00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:47.770
was figuring out that
powered cast reel.

00:08:47.770 --> 00:08:50.990
That was the thing that
electronic engineers,

00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:54.400
mechanical engineers, investors,
friends and family all told

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:57.230
us was probably impossible.

00:08:57.230 --> 00:08:59.390
But none of us are engineers.

00:08:59.390 --> 00:09:02.350
So we didn't have that
experience to kind of think

00:09:02.350 --> 00:09:03.110
it was impossible.

00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:05.000
We just knew this had to happen.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.530
We just knew that if we could
bring this experience to 365

00:09:08.530 --> 00:09:13.360
days a year, the
idea is just so big

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:16.160
and such a big life
improvement for snowboarders.

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:17.040
And so we just--

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:19.820
we-- they didn't understand
we had to make it happen.

00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:24.220
And so we had to kind of go the
bootstrapping route, especially

00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:28.522
since we didn't have
a lot of funding.

00:09:28.522 --> 00:09:30.730
And, again, you know, when
we were pitching investors

00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:32.938
in the beginning trying to
convince them to snowboard

00:09:32.938 --> 00:09:35.110
everywhere, they just--

00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:36.042
nobody would believe.

00:09:36.042 --> 00:09:37.750
Even Kickstarter didn't
believe, in fact.

00:09:37.750 --> 00:09:40.270
When we launched
our Kickstarter,

00:09:40.270 --> 00:09:43.660
they flagged us for spam because
they thought it was fake.

00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:47.845
And, luckily, I-- I was--
we built this in Brooklyn.

00:09:47.845 --> 00:09:48.970
Kickstarter is in Brooklyn.

00:09:48.970 --> 00:09:51.460
So when I got that email,
I was pretty annoyed

00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:52.590
because it was real.

00:09:52.590 --> 00:09:54.850
And so we just
grabbed the board,

00:09:54.850 --> 00:09:56.530
rode over to Kickstarter's
headquarters,

00:09:56.530 --> 00:09:58.696
and just did laps in their
lobby until they launched

00:09:58.696 --> 00:10:00.930
our campaign, which
only took about an hour,

00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:03.460
but he got up and
were up and running.

00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:06.370
But there were a number of
lessons that we learned along

00:10:06.370 --> 00:10:08.390
the way because when
we-- we started this,

00:10:08.390 --> 00:10:11.200
it was kind of early, and a lot
of harder projects happening

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:12.000
now, but--

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.770
but a few years ago, it
was kind of desperate,

00:10:14.770 --> 00:10:19.420
and there wasn't like a tutorial
out there, even a roadmap,

00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:21.670
on how to bootstrap hardware.

00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:23.500
But we learned-- we
were able to do it,

00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:25.291
and we learned a lot
of lessons on the way,

00:10:25.291 --> 00:10:26.780
so I'll share those with you.

00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:30.410
Number one, YouTube
is the Matrix.

00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:34.450
And what I mean by that is my
favorite part of "The Matrix"

00:10:34.450 --> 00:10:37.120
wasn't like dodging
bullets or flying.

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:41.251
It was like downloading skills
to your brain instantly.

00:10:41.251 --> 00:10:43.000
That was what I was
most fascinated about.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.800
If I could take anything
from "The Matrix"

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:46.841
and put it in real life,
that's why I would pick.

00:10:46.841 --> 00:10:49.210
And that's what
YouTube is in a way.

00:10:49.210 --> 00:10:51.170
I mean, I'm not an engineer.

00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:54.220
I knew nothing about what we--

00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:57.490
all this technology that we had
to put together for this board,

00:10:57.490 --> 00:11:02.980
and I remember it was like one
lazy Thanksgiving afternoon.

00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:03.820
Everybody had eaten.

00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:05.579
We were just kind of
all laying around.

00:11:05.579 --> 00:11:07.120
And I thought, wow,
I'd really rather

00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:09.560
be snowboarding right now.

00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:11.570
And I had an electric
skateboard at the time.

00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:13.278
And I was thinking,
like, this would just

00:11:13.278 --> 00:11:16.570
be such a better experience
if it felt like snowboarding.

00:11:16.570 --> 00:11:18.370
It would be game changing.

00:11:18.370 --> 00:11:21.370
And so I started kind of
thinking about those pieces

00:11:21.370 --> 00:11:23.100
of my electric skateboard.

00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:25.750
And I started searching,
OK, lithium ion batteries

00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:26.530
was a big feature.

00:11:26.530 --> 00:11:27.730
I knew nothing.

00:11:27.730 --> 00:11:29.650
What is a lithium ion battery?

00:11:29.650 --> 00:11:32.550
And I found on YouTube a
lecture from Carnegie Mellon,

00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:36.260
90 minutes, about lithium
ion battery technology.

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:38.470
And that was four years ago.

00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:40.840
We've actually gone through
a lot, built this product.

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:44.200
I know maybe 5% more than I
did that day after watching

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:47.170
that lecture, and, you
know, I watched it,

00:11:47.170 --> 00:11:49.630
and as like, kind of like, you
know, unplugged the Matrix,

00:11:49.630 --> 00:11:53.110
and I was like, I know
lithium ion batteries.

00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:54.820
And then I was
like, OK, how do I--

00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:56.660
how do I go to the next piece?

00:11:56.660 --> 00:12:00.282
How do you put electricity
through a rotating circuit?

00:12:00.282 --> 00:12:02.740
And turns out there's these
things called slip rings that I

00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:04.198
didn't even know
about, and they're

00:12:04.198 --> 00:12:06.820
in everything, a headphone
jack, in fact, is a slip ring.

00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:08.720
And so I saw a few
videos on those.

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:12.050
And we kind of had to reinvent
the slip ring a little bit,

00:12:12.050 --> 00:12:13.810
but the main idea was there.

00:12:13.810 --> 00:12:14.840
I knew, OK, we've--

00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:16.090
there's got to be a slip ring.

00:12:16.090 --> 00:12:18.040
There's got to be
electronic batteries.

00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:20.425
There's got to be motors and--

00:12:20.425 --> 00:12:22.630
you know, in a lazy afternoon,
you can surprisingly

00:12:22.630 --> 00:12:25.064
get a lot done on
YouTube if you spin

00:12:25.064 --> 00:12:26.230
it the right way, of course.

00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:30.970
But my biggest, I guess,
advice to even engineers

00:12:30.970 --> 00:12:34.090
is, if you don't know
anything about the technology,

00:12:34.090 --> 00:12:36.970
there's probably a
YouTube video out there.

00:12:36.970 --> 00:12:38.470
And, you know, even
if it's some guy

00:12:38.470 --> 00:12:39.850
in his garage
putting a tutorial,

00:12:39.850 --> 00:12:41.266
sometimes those
are the best ones.

00:12:44.170 --> 00:12:47.700
Next we-- kind of came up
with a way of doing PR,

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:50.090
and we called it
downstairs demo.

00:12:50.090 --> 00:12:53.080
And so traditionally
with PR, it's

00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:55.090
a big part of
bootstrapping something

00:12:55.090 --> 00:12:56.890
because you don't
have an ad budget,

00:12:56.890 --> 00:12:59.042
and you probably can't
even hire a PR agent.

00:12:59.042 --> 00:13:00.500
And so you've got
to get, you know,

00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:03.760
organic articles out there
that you aren't paying for.

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:06.190
And, traditionally,
you know, you--

00:13:06.190 --> 00:13:08.954
you research the writers
that you think you can--

00:13:08.954 --> 00:13:10.870
that would be interested
in what you're doing.

00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:13.930
You look at their interests,
the topics that they like,

00:13:13.930 --> 00:13:15.996
and how you can
position your company.

00:13:15.996 --> 00:13:17.620
And you write an
awesome email that you

00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:19.960
send at 10:00 AM on Tuesday
to kind of catch them

00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:21.250
in between tasks.

00:13:21.250 --> 00:13:23.740
But the problem is, everybody's
doing that, you know?

00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:26.770
They're getting thousands of
emails at 10 AM on Tuesday.

00:13:26.770 --> 00:13:30.400
And, unfortunately, most
likely, it won't get read.

00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:33.610
And so you have to take
it a step further in what

00:13:33.610 --> 00:13:35.320
we call the downstairs demo.

00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:37.900
And the first step
to that is find out

00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:40.319
where they work, the
address to where they work.

00:13:40.319 --> 00:13:41.860
This is getting
creepy, but just hang

00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:43.220
in there with me for a second.

00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:47.830
So you find out where they work,
and you show up maybe an hour

00:13:47.830 --> 00:13:51.790
before or after lunch, maybe
the last hour of the day,

00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:53.041
and you get up to their lobby.

00:13:53.041 --> 00:13:55.373
You're not going to get past
the lobby, but don't worry,

00:13:55.373 --> 00:13:57.040
you don't have to
get past the lobby.

00:13:57.040 --> 00:14:00.250
You just take your
smartphone, and you

00:14:00.250 --> 00:14:03.805
film yourself using your
device in their lobby

00:14:03.805 --> 00:14:06.430
or in front of their building if
they kick you out of the lobby

00:14:06.430 --> 00:14:08.230
or on the street if
they make you get off

00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:10.607
the foyer, which has happened.

00:14:10.607 --> 00:14:12.940
And in our case, you know,
just doing donuts and saying,

00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:15.190
hey, look, you're one
short elevator ride

00:14:15.190 --> 00:14:18.540
away from trying
this crazy new tech.

00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:21.420
That got a 100% response rate.

00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:24.600
Not everybody came down, but
half the people came down,

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:26.100
and all those people
wrote about it.

00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:27.810
So that's how we
got in "The Verge,"

00:14:27.810 --> 00:14:31.890
"Engadget," "Gizmodo," and
a lot of big publications.

00:14:31.890 --> 00:14:34.020
The other half of
the people all said

00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:35.860
the exact same
thing, which is, hey,

00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:40.230
I've been burned by hardware
startup Kickstarter projects

00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:40.760
before.

00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:42.450
And I just can't
write about you.

00:14:42.450 --> 00:14:43.980
If you can figure that
out before you show up

00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:45.480
to their lobby,
that would be great.

00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:48.000
But, you know, sometimes
you just have to show up.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.360
But that's a big thing.

00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:51.150
I mean, we were lucky
we were in New York.

00:14:51.150 --> 00:14:53.070
And it was convenient,
but when we did this,

00:14:53.070 --> 00:14:55.260
we did it in one to two days.

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:58.500
And so quick trip to New
York, or LA, or wherever,

00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:02.390
if you're not in these areas,
you can get a lot done.

00:15:02.390 --> 00:15:05.280
OK, so on the
prototyping side, you're

00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:08.070
going to need a 3D printer if
you're prototyping hardware

00:15:08.070 --> 00:15:10.800
because rapid
prototyping is just--

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:12.780
it's not rapid.

00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:14.609
You know, you're talking
one to-- you know,

00:15:14.609 --> 00:15:16.650
one to three days on the
fastest turnaround time,

00:15:16.650 --> 00:15:18.310
and it's incredibly expensive.

00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:20.340
In fact, on the first,
you know, two models,

00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:22.080
you might send a
rapid prototyping,

00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:24.140
you could actually
buy a 3D printer.

00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:26.310
And once you make
that $1,000 to $3,000

00:15:26.310 --> 00:15:29.700
investment for a 3D
printer, it's almost free,

00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:33.540
and you can obviously
iterate your prototypes

00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:35.190
a lot faster by
printing them at home

00:15:35.190 --> 00:15:36.990
because you are--
you have become

00:15:36.990 --> 00:15:39.330
essentially a rapid prototyper.

00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:42.940
But there's ways to even
speed it up beyond that.

00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:46.200
So, for example, say you've
got a small motor mount

00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:48.450
that's part of your
project, and you've

00:15:48.450 --> 00:15:50.580
got eight features
that, you know,

00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:53.910
holes, or things that
fit into other things

00:15:53.910 --> 00:15:55.140
as part of your project.

00:15:55.140 --> 00:15:57.189
And you have to dial
in each one at a time.

00:15:57.189 --> 00:15:58.980
Now, say this a little
motor mount out only

00:15:58.980 --> 00:16:03.330
takes an hour to print, which
is a pretty fast print, OK?

00:16:03.330 --> 00:16:05.820
You've got eight features,
each one, we'll say,

00:16:05.820 --> 00:16:08.650
takes two or three, kind
of prints to get it right.

00:16:08.650 --> 00:16:10.740
That's 20 prints you
have to make to dial in

00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:12.610
that one motor mount.

00:16:12.610 --> 00:16:15.570
Now, that's still light speed
compared to rapid prototyping.

00:16:15.570 --> 00:16:19.410
You won't even get an email back
from the company in 20 hours.

00:16:19.410 --> 00:16:21.150
But you can go way faster.

00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:25.380
And that is by printing
in 2D rather than 3D.

00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:28.020
And so if you've got that
that motor mount, and you're

00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:30.120
trying to dial in a
hole, you can actually

00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:34.920
just print a 1 millimeter
layer face and, you know,

00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:38.130
peel it off, get your calipers
out, measure it, dial it in.

00:16:38.130 --> 00:16:39.660
And you can print
that 1 millimeter

00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:41.820
layer in two minutes.

00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:44.010
So 20 prints
instead of 20 hours,

00:16:44.010 --> 00:16:46.410
you just turn it into
40 minutes of printing.

00:16:46.410 --> 00:16:50.157
And that's how you can dial in
entire parts of an afternoon.

00:16:50.157 --> 00:16:51.615
And that was a big,
big lesson kind

00:16:51.615 --> 00:16:53.620
of we learned along
that way, and, you know,

00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:56.540
it took literally days to kind
of get all this stuff together

00:16:56.540 --> 00:16:58.320
and be on the road.

00:17:01.330 --> 00:17:03.430
Definitely iterate with
off-the-shelf components,

00:17:03.430 --> 00:17:05.650
and this isn't
anything, a new idea,

00:17:05.650 --> 00:17:09.130
but you definitely have to
kind of think about some

00:17:09.130 --> 00:17:11.170
of the constraints
that might come

00:17:11.170 --> 00:17:12.910
with those off-the-shelf
components.

00:17:12.910 --> 00:17:15.050
And we had to deal
with one in particular

00:17:15.050 --> 00:17:16.780
that was a little scary.

00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:20.349
So our first version
of this, we basically

00:17:20.349 --> 00:17:22.839
took apart an
electronic helicopter,

00:17:22.839 --> 00:17:25.270
put the motors on a
shopping cart wheel,

00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:27.430
and put that onto a skateboard.

00:17:27.430 --> 00:17:29.540
And we were off and running.

00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:32.330
And what we didn't
realize, though,

00:17:32.330 --> 00:17:34.510
is a feature of electronic
helicopters, which

00:17:34.510 --> 00:17:37.210
is great when you're flying.

00:17:37.210 --> 00:17:40.390
If you lose radio signal,
it'll go full speed

00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:43.570
to stay in the air.

00:17:43.570 --> 00:17:46.900
I think you guys understand
where I'm going with this.

00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:49.520
We'd be riding around,
and in New York City,

00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:54.520
maybe the most dense place
of 2.5 gigahertz networks,

00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:57.550
and when you lose
signal, you go full speed

00:17:57.550 --> 00:17:59.050
for a good like
one to two seconds

00:17:59.050 --> 00:18:00.440
until it kind of gets back.

00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:02.470
So it was kind of
this mechanical bull

00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:05.500
that you had to be just ready
to go full speed at any given

00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:06.770
time.

00:18:06.770 --> 00:18:09.470
And so we kind of learned with
these parts, OK, you know,

00:18:09.470 --> 00:18:10.730
we learned these constraints.

00:18:10.730 --> 00:18:12.310
And so a lot
off-the-shelf parts,

00:18:12.310 --> 00:18:14.890
you kind of have to read a
lot more of the directions

00:18:14.890 --> 00:18:17.610
than you might be prepared
to before you get going.

00:18:20.270 --> 00:18:24.180
Then the mobile lab, so you
definitely with hardware,

00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:26.180
you're going to be doing
a lot of field testing.

00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:27.980
And in the beginning,
you're going

00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:31.790
to be doing a lot more
fixing than actually testing

00:18:31.790 --> 00:18:35.362
in the field, and those
minutes that turn into hours,

00:18:35.362 --> 00:18:37.070
and eventually turn
into days of testing,

00:18:37.070 --> 00:18:39.195
they're like gold
in the beginning,

00:18:39.195 --> 00:18:41.570
and, you know, when you're
out in the field and something

00:18:41.570 --> 00:18:44.210
breaks, which in the beginning,
will happen in the first two

00:18:44.210 --> 00:18:46.265
minutes, you know,
you don't want

00:18:46.265 --> 00:18:47.649
to have to go back
to the office,

00:18:47.649 --> 00:18:49.940
you know, 45-minute train
ride, and go fix it, and then

00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:51.890
go back out to the field.

00:18:51.890 --> 00:18:53.810
You need to take your
mobile lab with you.

00:18:53.810 --> 00:18:56.540
And so, obviously, there's
like a lot of mechanical things

00:18:56.540 --> 00:19:01.190
that are built for going with
you like electronic drills,

00:19:01.190 --> 00:19:03.390
wrenches, things like that.

00:19:03.390 --> 00:19:05.940
But eventually, you know,
you're going to have to solder,

00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:08.180
and soldering
irons unfortunately

00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:11.630
take a lot of current because
they have to get really hot,

00:19:11.630 --> 00:19:13.410
and you won't always
have a plug with you,

00:19:13.410 --> 00:19:17.150
especially if you're, you know,
going on New York City testing

00:19:17.150 --> 00:19:18.300
your product.

00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:20.960
So you have to find plugs
around, but they exist.

00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:24.740
You know, we've soldered
outside a public bathroom

00:19:24.740 --> 00:19:26.750
in Central Park.

00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:29.330
I've soldered in a coat
closet at the Plaza Hotel.

00:19:29.330 --> 00:19:32.360
They're nice enough to let
me get in there and solder.

00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:34.880
They have these random plugs
in the ceilings in the subway

00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:36.689
that you can-- you
can dial into and get

00:19:36.689 --> 00:19:37.730
enough current to solder.

00:19:37.730 --> 00:19:40.460
But just bring the whole
lab with you, like,

00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:42.725
don't think you have to go
back and just, you know,

00:19:42.725 --> 00:19:43.850
carry everything around.

00:19:43.850 --> 00:19:45.475
If you've got to drag
a wagon with you,

00:19:45.475 --> 00:19:47.370
it's really worth it
because, again, it's

00:19:47.370 --> 00:19:49.670
going to be two
minutes of testing

00:19:49.670 --> 00:19:53.780
and two hours of fixing
in the beginning.

00:19:53.780 --> 00:19:58.090
And, so, you know, I could go on
and on about hardware stories,

00:19:58.090 --> 00:19:58.690
startups.

00:19:58.690 --> 00:20:01.450
But I think maybe this is a
good time to just switch it over

00:20:01.450 --> 00:20:04.840
to a Q&amp;A and, again, I
just really appreciate

00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:07.900
everybody coming out to hear
our story and the invitation.

00:20:07.900 --> 00:20:09.498
Thanks so much.

00:20:09.498 --> 00:20:10.496
[APPLAUSE]

00:20:14.990 --> 00:20:18.400
Now we have a question cube.

00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:19.390
Anybody?

00:20:19.390 --> 00:20:22.070
OK, I am going to try to--

00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:22.870
awesome.

00:20:22.870 --> 00:20:25.120
AUDIENCE: Nicely done.

00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:28.540
So the big difference
I see in terms

00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:32.110
of between this and
boring skateboarding

00:20:32.110 --> 00:20:36.100
is the terrible things
you're doing to the wheels.

00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:40.660
So you said that people go
through three batteries, which

00:20:40.660 --> 00:20:42.370
then you have to take
home and recharge.

00:20:42.370 --> 00:20:44.414
How often do they have
to replace the wheels?

00:20:44.414 --> 00:20:45.830
AARON ADERS: Really
good question.

00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:49.090
So in skateboarding,
you have a couple

00:20:49.090 --> 00:20:51.010
of factors that go
into your wheels.

00:20:51.010 --> 00:20:53.690
One is kind of rebound,
how bouncy it is.

00:20:53.690 --> 00:20:57.060
Another one is called durometer,
which is how hard it is.

00:20:57.060 --> 00:20:59.770
And so they have durometer from,
like, you know, like, jelly,

00:20:59.770 --> 00:21:01.600
all the way to hard plastic.

00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:04.400
And the skateboard wheels
fall somewhere in between.

00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:07.480
And so the harder
durometer will last longer

00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:09.990
because it just resists that--

00:21:09.990 --> 00:21:11.650
that abrasion a
little bit better.

00:21:11.650 --> 00:21:14.770
And, also, it slides
better because it's not

00:21:14.770 --> 00:21:16.480
gripping that pavement.

00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:20.622
And so we use a bit harder
durometer wheels than probably

00:21:20.622 --> 00:21:21.580
the average skateboard.

00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:24.430
A skateboarder would consider
our wheels a bit hard

00:21:24.430 --> 00:21:25.712
on that durometer side.

00:21:25.712 --> 00:21:27.670
But, again, it kind of
works with that sliding,

00:21:27.670 --> 00:21:29.920
and it lasts a lot longer.

00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:33.280
And, also, a key, so you
can tell a little bit

00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:34.400
in this image.

00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:38.020
So the outside of the wheels
are kind of getting dirty,

00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:39.700
and they start to cone.

00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:42.280
And so whenever you
get too much wear,

00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:44.790
you just flip the
wheel 180 degrees.

00:21:44.790 --> 00:21:46.720
And then you start
working on the other side.

00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:48.490
And then you flip it again,
and you flip it again,

00:21:48.490 --> 00:21:50.260
and you might get
six flips before you

00:21:50.260 --> 00:21:52.000
have to change the wheels.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:55.750
When I had-- it was a
five mile round-m trip

00:21:55.750 --> 00:21:59.500
commute in Brooklyn, a set of
wheels, when flipped regularly,

00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:02.090
would last about six months.

00:22:02.090 --> 00:22:02.900
AUDIENCE: On this?

00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:04.157
AARON ADERS: Yeah.

00:22:04.157 --> 00:22:04.740
AUDIENCE: Wow!

00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:05.640
AARON ADERS: But when
you're commuting,

00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:07.974
you're not, obviously, doing
a bunch of 360s and things.

00:22:07.974 --> 00:22:09.431
You know, you've
got a place to be.

00:22:09.431 --> 00:22:10.090
SO--

00:22:10.090 --> 00:22:11.299
AUDIENCE: Yeah, but even so--

00:22:11.299 --> 00:22:13.006
AARON ADERS: But even
so, yeah, you can--

00:22:13.006 --> 00:22:15.310
you can make a set of wheels
last a very long time.

00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:19.830
AUDIENCE: So when you say you're
going with a harder material,

00:22:19.830 --> 00:22:21.710
what's the--

00:22:21.710 --> 00:22:24.900
what kind of snow skiing
does this correspond to?

00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:29.400
Is it like a prepared piste or
morning somewhat frozen over,

00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:32.820
or just the skid-- the
braking performance

00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:34.350
you had look pretty good.

00:22:34.350 --> 00:22:38.250
So it feels-- it looks like and
feels like a pretty soft snow.

00:22:38.250 --> 00:22:40.500
AARON ADERS: Yeah, I would
say the-- in the most ideal

00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:44.370
scenario, which is a nice,
kind of broken-in wheel,

00:22:44.370 --> 00:22:47.150
and super smooth--

00:22:47.150 --> 00:22:48.540
it's really the
pavement actually

00:22:48.540 --> 00:22:51.910
that kind of determines the
feeling more than anything.

00:22:51.910 --> 00:22:53.340
If you're on like
a garage floor,

00:22:53.340 --> 00:23:00.310
say, like, a really slick
concrete, it's not like ice,

00:23:00.310 --> 00:23:03.270
but it's definitely like a
really hard packed, we'll say.

00:23:03.270 --> 00:23:07.320
But the best is kind of
a nice kind of blacktop,

00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:08.550
like a fresh street.

00:23:08.550 --> 00:23:10.560
That just feels
like a nice groomer,

00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:12.720
like you got the first
groomer run of the day,

00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:13.590
and you're just--

00:23:13.590 --> 00:23:15.180
just jetting super fast.

00:23:15.180 --> 00:23:16.717
I'd say it's kind
of more like that.

00:23:16.717 --> 00:23:17.550
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:23:21.036 --> 00:23:23.385
AARON ADERS: Nice.

00:23:23.385 --> 00:23:24.760
AUDIENCE: This is
really awesome.

00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:26.560
Can you talk a little
bit more about how

00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:29.620
you, like, eject from the board
or how the straps come off?

00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:31.780
Like, can you adjust the--

00:23:31.780 --> 00:23:34.094
the degree to which
you're strapped in?

00:23:34.094 --> 00:23:35.760
And then like how
does the trigger work?

00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:37.720
I noticed two buttons
in your video.

00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:40.240
AARON ADERS: Yeah,
so straps first.

00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:41.770
We-- where did we go?

00:23:41.770 --> 00:23:42.550
OK, here we go.

00:23:42.550 --> 00:23:44.734
So Chris actually did that.

00:23:44.734 --> 00:23:46.150
And I told him, I
said, OK, you're

00:23:46.150 --> 00:23:50.560
going to have to catch a
front edge and bail out,

00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:53.380
which if you do this on
a snowboard, there's no--

00:23:53.380 --> 00:23:55.100
there's no turning back.

00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:57.020
I mean, you're going
to go face down.

00:23:57.020 --> 00:24:00.340
So we probably should
have this in slow mo.

00:24:00.340 --> 00:24:03.100
But more or less,
when you're to get out

00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:06.000
and eject really easily, you--

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.810
the footholds are kind
of out from the edge.

00:24:08.810 --> 00:24:12.340
So when you're riding, you're
putting outward pressure

00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:15.700
with your feet to really, like,
hold in and kind of maintain

00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:17.170
that position.

00:24:17.170 --> 00:24:20.200
But to get out, you just
bring your feet together.

00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:21.700
And if you bring
your feet together,

00:24:21.700 --> 00:24:23.240
you can even jump forward.

00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:26.320
But if you don't, you know, you
can jump backwards or whatever.

00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:28.236
But, yeah, we're
kind of trained,

00:24:28.236 --> 00:24:29.860
and you get a muscle
memory after doing

00:24:29.860 --> 00:24:31.450
it a couple of times
and just, like,

00:24:31.450 --> 00:24:33.430
hopping together
and getting out.

00:24:33.430 --> 00:24:36.220
And you can adjust the
height, and how tight it

00:24:36.220 --> 00:24:37.540
is, and things like that.

00:24:37.540 --> 00:24:39.700
So you-- I ride a
little bit looser

00:24:39.700 --> 00:24:43.837
because I like to be able
to jump out very easily.

00:24:43.837 --> 00:24:44.920
But you want that control.

00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:46.960
You want to be
able to really like

00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:48.490
press in because
that's really going

00:24:48.490 --> 00:24:52.240
to give you that broad control.

00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:57.040
On the remote control, so there
is a trigger and a thumb wheel.

00:24:57.040 --> 00:24:59.050
And that's really--
you can find that

00:24:59.050 --> 00:25:02.650
on most wireless, remote
electronic ridables

00:25:02.650 --> 00:25:06.640
because there's the safety
or dead man switch, which

00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:07.815
in our case, is the trigger.

00:25:07.815 --> 00:25:09.190
And then there's
the thumb wheel,

00:25:09.190 --> 00:25:10.810
which is the accelerator.

00:25:10.810 --> 00:25:13.030
And there's kind of
two schools of thought,

00:25:13.030 --> 00:25:15.090
and the skateboarding,
or electric skateboarding

00:25:15.090 --> 00:25:16.460
community, is kind of
split down the middle.

00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:18.501
And it's just whether you
have the deadman switch

00:25:18.501 --> 00:25:20.590
on your thumb or
your forefinger,

00:25:20.590 --> 00:25:24.160
and you have the accelerator on
your thumb or the forefinger.

00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:27.132
So the other way of doing it
is putting the deadman's switch

00:25:27.132 --> 00:25:29.590
on your thumb, and then the
trigger kind of like, you know,

00:25:29.590 --> 00:25:31.365
the old little RC cars.

00:25:31.365 --> 00:25:33.490
The reason we didn't go
that route is because we do

00:25:33.490 --> 00:25:38.080
find that some people, when
they crash, they grip, you know?

00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:40.450
And you definitely don't
want to go full speed.

00:25:40.450 --> 00:25:44.454
And so, even in our
case, if you grip,

00:25:44.454 --> 00:25:46.870
you're not going to, you know,
likely move the thumb wheel

00:25:46.870 --> 00:25:47.930
forward.

00:25:47.930 --> 00:25:49.900
But moving the
thumb wheel backward

00:25:49.900 --> 00:25:54.130
will actually provide electronic
braking, which, typically, we

00:25:54.130 --> 00:25:56.260
only use if you're in
like a tight space,

00:25:56.260 --> 00:25:59.230
and you can't turn
sideways to brake.

00:25:59.230 --> 00:26:01.940
But the sliding
the brake, I mean,

00:26:01.940 --> 00:26:04.540
that's the most fun,
the most effective,

00:26:04.540 --> 00:26:08.170
and it actually got us
about less than half

00:26:08.170 --> 00:26:11.530
the product insurance rate as
a normal electric skateboard

00:26:11.530 --> 00:26:15.340
because with those brakes,
they're all electronic.

00:26:15.340 --> 00:26:17.170
And, you know, you
can lose your brakes

00:26:17.170 --> 00:26:21.970
by losing the wireless
signal, breaking a belt,

00:26:21.970 --> 00:26:25.030
or going over 25 miles
an hour, at which there's

00:26:25.030 --> 00:26:27.670
too much momentum to stop you.

00:26:27.670 --> 00:26:30.881
And so that provides a lot
of stability and safety.

00:26:30.881 --> 00:26:31.880
AUDIENCE: Great, thanks.

00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:34.710
And I have actually like dreamed
about snowboarding to work,

00:26:34.710 --> 00:26:37.782
and snowboarding on
roads, and stuff.

00:26:37.782 --> 00:26:38.990
AARON ADERS: Yeah, it's here.

00:26:41.204 --> 00:26:42.870
AUDIENCE: If you could
talk a little bit

00:26:42.870 --> 00:26:44.640
about your background,
what you were

00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:47.190
doing before you started this?

00:26:47.190 --> 00:26:48.540
AARON ADERS: Sure.

00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:52.410
I actually-- I co-founded
a marketing agency

00:26:52.410 --> 00:26:56.040
with a couple of buddies
when I was 24 years old.

00:26:56.040 --> 00:27:00.450
And it was doing a lot
of digital marketing,

00:27:00.450 --> 00:27:02.340
a lot of SEO, so
Google was obviously

00:27:02.340 --> 00:27:06.990
very relevant to our daily
lives in that agency.

00:27:06.990 --> 00:27:09.510
And, you know, but I'm
a lifelong snowboarder.

00:27:09.510 --> 00:27:13.300
This is something, you know,
that I always dreamed of.

00:27:13.300 --> 00:27:15.670
I actually had started a
version of that company

00:27:15.670 --> 00:27:18.210
when I was in high school,
and my junior year, I actually

00:27:18.210 --> 00:27:20.050
moved out of my parents'
house and started

00:27:20.050 --> 00:27:22.740
just snowballing all the
time and barely graduated,

00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:25.220
but it was always--

00:27:25.220 --> 00:27:27.315
kind of my dream--

00:27:27.315 --> 00:27:29.440
my dream thing because I'm
from Indiana originally.

00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:31.470
And it's super flat, but
there's a lot of snow.

00:27:31.470 --> 00:27:33.340
And I would only get
to ride once a year.

00:27:33.340 --> 00:27:36.630
And so dreaming about that
at the end of every snowboard

00:27:36.630 --> 00:27:39.760
trip, just-- it's always been
kind of in the back of my head.

00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:42.220
But, yeah, I had
a background of,

00:27:42.220 --> 00:27:44.670
you know, starting
a company before.

00:27:44.670 --> 00:27:48.350
And so when-- on
that Thanksgiving

00:27:48.350 --> 00:27:51.300
Day when this thing got in my
head, it just couldn't get out.

00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:55.800
And so, eventually, when LEIF
started growing and needing

00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:58.710
more of my time, I switched
over full time from my agency

00:27:58.710 --> 00:27:59.739
to LEIF Tech.

00:28:05.970 --> 00:28:07.600
AUDIENCE: Can you
tell a bit how do you

00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:10.900
see the evolvement of
that, the next model,

00:28:10.900 --> 00:28:14.380
or the next generation, how do
you see this product going even

00:28:14.380 --> 00:28:15.640
further?

00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:17.870
AARON ADERS: Yeah, for sure.

00:28:17.870 --> 00:28:20.590
I think that lithium
ion battery technology

00:28:20.590 --> 00:28:23.320
is going to define a
lot of the direction

00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:26.110
because we've really nailed
the experience in terms

00:28:26.110 --> 00:28:29.320
of that snowboarding
feeling, and I

00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:33.250
think that future
products from us will--

00:28:33.250 --> 00:28:35.620
will maybe get a little
bit more dialed in on that.

00:28:35.620 --> 00:28:37.570
I mean, that feature
is really nice,

00:28:37.570 --> 00:28:39.760
but I think it's more
about just being lighter,

00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:43.870
possibly being faster,
but really just--

00:28:43.870 --> 00:28:47.200
and getting the price down,
I think, could help a bit.

00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:49.900
And that'll come with
volume as we grow.

00:28:49.900 --> 00:28:51.730
But, you know,
just really serving

00:28:51.730 --> 00:28:54.310
these 39 million snowboarders
around the world.

00:28:54.310 --> 00:28:57.490
That's our dream is just
to grow our beloved sport

00:28:57.490 --> 00:29:01.134
and make it a year-round
type initiative.

00:29:01.134 --> 00:29:02.800
AUDIENCE: You just
led into the question

00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:04.540
I've been holding back.

00:29:04.540 --> 00:29:07.540
So with a skateboard,
I can see a point

00:29:07.540 --> 00:29:09.316
with putting the battery
pack on the board

00:29:09.316 --> 00:29:10.690
because you
routinely do actually

00:29:10.690 --> 00:29:12.690
take your feet off the board.

00:29:12.690 --> 00:29:14.740
But with this, when you're
traveling strapped in,

00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:16.630
you've got much less
reason to keep your--

00:29:16.630 --> 00:29:19.390
keep the battery
back on the board.

00:29:19.390 --> 00:29:22.180
So you could wear
it, and you just

00:29:22.180 --> 00:29:24.580
mentioned that the
board is heavy.

00:29:24.580 --> 00:29:27.760
Are you implying that the
board with all the stuff on it

00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:30.452
is heavier than a
snowboard and a pair

00:29:30.452 --> 00:29:32.710
of depressingly-heavy boots?

00:29:32.710 --> 00:29:34.660
AARON ADERS: Well,
actually it's about equal

00:29:34.660 --> 00:29:37.330
because you have so much gear
on when you're snowboarding.

00:29:37.330 --> 00:29:41.110
So if you threw, you know, your
boots, your jacket, your pants,

00:29:41.110 --> 00:29:43.780
gloves, and all these things
in a pile with your snowboard,

00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:45.730
it's about the same weight.

00:29:45.730 --> 00:29:49.224
And so, you know, we're
still talking 15, 16 pounds

00:29:49.224 --> 00:29:50.140
on our smallest model.

00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:53.290
But, you know, I mean, the
dream is to go even lighter.

00:29:53.290 --> 00:29:56.720
If you're not living in
New York, or San Francisco,

00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:59.170
you're probably not walking
a lot with the board.

00:29:59.170 --> 00:30:01.450
So it's not really an
issue for most people

00:30:01.450 --> 00:30:03.310
to just throw it in
the back of their car.

00:30:03.310 --> 00:30:04.750
But we definitely
want it to be lighter.

00:30:04.750 --> 00:30:07.249
I mean, that's just probably a
better experience all around.

00:30:07.249 --> 00:30:09.730
And, you know, I do believe
that, you know, one day,

00:30:09.730 --> 00:30:11.970
you'll buy a cell phone
with all the energy

00:30:11.970 --> 00:30:13.840
I'll ever need for it.

00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:16.012
And so hopefully that
will happen at the same--

00:30:16.012 --> 00:30:16.970
with our board as well.

00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:23.400
AUDIENCE: So I think the
design of your straps

00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:27.380
is really interesting, and I was
wondering if you've explored--

00:30:27.380 --> 00:30:30.540
so I-- I have one of those
surf-style skateboards with

00:30:30.540 --> 00:30:31.140
the--

00:30:31.140 --> 00:30:34.320
I don't know if you've seen
these where the front trucks

00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:35.874
really turn a lot?

00:30:35.874 --> 00:30:38.165
AARON ADERS: Yeah, it's got
a caster wheel, it kind of,

00:30:38.165 --> 00:30:38.470
well--

00:30:38.470 --> 00:30:39.030
AUDIENCE: Yeah, that--

00:30:39.030 --> 00:30:39.870
AARON ADERS: Yeah,
it pivots, right.

00:30:39.870 --> 00:30:40.400
AUDIENCE: That kind of thing.

00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:42.630
It's made by a company,
a local company,

00:30:42.630 --> 00:30:44.700
called Carver, the
one that I have.

00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:47.980
And I-- and I love it,
but you can't easily

00:30:47.980 --> 00:30:51.630
ali with that skateboard because
it's a little bit unstable.

00:30:51.630 --> 00:30:53.760
It occurs to me
that, like, if I had

00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:58.950
straps kind of like your straps,
I could probably jump up curbs

00:30:58.950 --> 00:31:01.680
without a problem with
that, and it might

00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:04.470
be an interesting thing to try.

00:31:04.470 --> 00:31:05.310
I don't know.

00:31:05.310 --> 00:31:07.680
When you were
prototyping this stuff,

00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:13.860
did you try it on-- on some more
standard kind of skateboards?

00:31:13.860 --> 00:31:17.580
AARON ADERS: Well, they're
a bit scary on a skateboard.

00:31:17.580 --> 00:31:18.330
And I'll tell you.

00:31:18.330 --> 00:31:21.580
One, it's kind of hard to
push and then get back in.

00:31:21.580 --> 00:31:24.600
But the second thing is, I
mean, you can't slide and stop.

00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:27.540
So you really, really, really
don't want to be locked in.

00:31:27.540 --> 00:31:29.629
I mean, that's why
with the skateboard,

00:31:29.629 --> 00:31:32.170
the electric skateboard has to
be completely clean on the top

00:31:32.170 --> 00:31:34.211
so you can, you know, kind
of move around and get

00:31:34.211 --> 00:31:35.640
your stance, but
for us, you know,

00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:37.600
you're really fixed
on the outside.

00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:40.380
And so that ability to
slide to stop, I mean,

00:31:40.380 --> 00:31:42.690
that's what the footholds
really help you with.

00:31:42.690 --> 00:31:46.950
But on a skateboard, again,
if you're not pushing,

00:31:46.950 --> 00:31:51.630
then you don't have to
worry about moving back in

00:31:51.630 --> 00:31:53.400
to push so if you
have electronic.

00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:57.450
But, again, like, it's a
little scary just because you

00:31:57.450 --> 00:31:59.730
can't-- you can't
slide and stop.

00:31:59.730 --> 00:32:00.510
AUDIENCE: I see.

00:32:00.510 --> 00:32:02.970
Yeah, the thing about
pushing is, like,

00:32:02.970 --> 00:32:05.555
with those special trucks
that I was talking about--

00:32:05.555 --> 00:32:06.305
AARON ADERS: Yeah.

00:32:06.305 --> 00:32:08.220
AUDIENCE: You can--
you can basically--

00:32:08.220 --> 00:32:09.450
you barely need to push.

00:32:09.450 --> 00:32:11.490
You can just go side
to side and carve.

00:32:11.490 --> 00:32:12.990
AARON ADERS: Oh,
the pumping, right.

00:32:12.990 --> 00:32:14.031
AUDIENCE: Yeah, and pump.

00:32:14.031 --> 00:32:16.169
But, yeah, I get the--

00:32:16.169 --> 00:32:18.210
AARON ADERS: It's the
stopping part that's scary.

00:32:18.210 --> 00:32:19.260
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:32:19.260 --> 00:32:21.570
AARON ADERS: How do
you stop on this thing?

00:32:21.570 --> 00:32:24.870
AUDIENCE: I mean, I guess,
sometimes you can jump off.

00:32:24.870 --> 00:32:27.550
You can do a power
slide type thing,

00:32:27.550 --> 00:32:28.950
depending on your wheels.

00:32:28.950 --> 00:32:31.610
AARON ADERS: Yeah, maybe
if you got over that--

00:32:31.610 --> 00:32:33.220
that caster, and
maybe you were able

00:32:33.220 --> 00:32:36.330
slide and get a
little friction maybe.

00:32:36.330 --> 00:32:39.900
But, yeah, I find them scary
on almost anything else.

00:32:39.900 --> 00:32:41.621
But, yeah, we have tried that.

00:32:41.621 --> 00:32:43.620
You definitely want to
be able to turn and stop.

00:32:49.705 --> 00:32:51.330
AUDIENCE: Has anyone
ever done anything

00:32:51.330 --> 00:32:53.538
that you weren't expecting
them to do with the board?

00:32:56.331 --> 00:32:58.080
AARON ADERS: Well, I
think that, you know,

00:32:58.080 --> 00:33:01.440
the hardest part of this
project wasn't getting

00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:02.710
the thing invented, actually.

00:33:02.710 --> 00:33:06.930
We did that in about five
months from just an empty desk

00:33:06.930 --> 00:33:08.790
with drawings to,
actually, a thing

00:33:08.790 --> 00:33:11.400
on the ground that, you know,
you could slide stuff down.

00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:13.110
The hard part was
getting it to something

00:33:13.110 --> 00:33:17.370
that a consumer is not going to
break in the first 10 minutes.

00:33:17.370 --> 00:33:19.740
Yeah, I mean, I
think consumers will

00:33:19.740 --> 00:33:21.830
do like things with
your product that you

00:33:21.830 --> 00:33:26.980
wouldn't imagine, you know,
sitting on the motherboard,

00:33:26.980 --> 00:33:28.950
for example.

00:33:28.950 --> 00:33:32.670
But I think some of the
more surprising thing

00:33:32.670 --> 00:33:35.370
was just kind of how
quickly a lot of people

00:33:35.370 --> 00:33:36.433
have picked it up.

00:33:36.433 --> 00:33:38.119
You know, I think,
in my case, it

00:33:38.119 --> 00:33:40.410
was a little different because
I was riding prototypes.

00:33:40.410 --> 00:33:41.310
I would brake constantly.

00:33:41.310 --> 00:33:43.020
So it kind of took
me forever to learn.

00:33:43.020 --> 00:33:45.870
But seeing how quickly
people jump on and just start

00:33:45.870 --> 00:33:48.710
sliding around, I mean, just
blows my mind sometimes.

00:33:48.710 --> 00:33:51.880
I'm like, wow it took me
hours to get to that point.

00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:53.970
And they literally just
kind of jumped off.

00:33:53.970 --> 00:33:59.560
But the key thing was dialing
in the snowboard feel.

00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:01.860
And so if you
snowboard, we actually

00:34:01.860 --> 00:34:04.770
have you close your eyes
when we put you on the board

00:34:04.770 --> 00:34:07.650
for the first time, and
we control the speed,

00:34:07.650 --> 00:34:09.900
and you know, we let you--
we hold the shoulder so you

00:34:09.900 --> 00:34:11.191
have a little bit of stability.

00:34:11.191 --> 00:34:14.790
But if you close your eyes, and
you imagine you're on the snow,

00:34:14.790 --> 00:34:18.690
it just happens
immediately, just magically.

00:34:18.690 --> 00:34:20.500
But then when you open
your eyes, and you--

00:34:20.500 --> 00:34:22.874
you know, you see the pavement
and all these other things

00:34:22.874 --> 00:34:25.500
that kind of make you
nervous, then, you know, you--

00:34:25.500 --> 00:34:27.850
you've got to kind of
learn to get over that.

00:34:27.850 --> 00:34:30.389
But what we learned from
doing a lot of demos

00:34:30.389 --> 00:34:32.872
is, if someone has snowboarding
experience, just blindfold

00:34:32.872 --> 00:34:34.830
them, make them close
their eyes, do something,

00:34:34.830 --> 00:34:37.860
because then they'll feel
that in the first 10 seconds.

00:34:37.860 --> 00:34:40.254
And once they feel that slide--

00:34:40.254 --> 00:34:42.420
because it really does feel
like snow because you're

00:34:42.420 --> 00:34:43.800
kind of going
sideways, and like,

00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:46.080
that just doesn't
happen anywhere else,

00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:47.270
then they're hooked.

00:34:47.270 --> 00:34:50.400
Then they will go through
and fall or do anything

00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:52.870
to kind of have
that feeling again.

00:34:52.870 --> 00:34:56.100
And so that was a big thing
we learned going on is,

00:34:56.100 --> 00:34:59.710
like, get a user sliding
as quickly as possible.

00:35:04.877 --> 00:35:07.460
AUDIENCE: So you're saying that
it's pretty easy to learn if I

00:35:07.460 --> 00:35:09.585
don't-- know how to snowboard,
but I don't know how

00:35:09.585 --> 00:35:11.000
to skateboard?

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:13.730
AARON ADERS: You're
actually better off.

00:35:13.730 --> 00:35:18.140
In fact, the best candidate that
we could ask for that has never

00:35:18.140 --> 00:35:20.030
got on a board
before is somebody

00:35:20.030 --> 00:35:22.130
that has never skateboarded
because there's

00:35:22.130 --> 00:35:24.380
certain things you have to
unlearn from skateboarding.

00:35:24.380 --> 00:35:26.671
If you ride this like a
skateboard, it just won't work.

00:35:26.671 --> 00:35:28.880
You'll be super
frustrated, somebody

00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:32.030
with snowboarding experience,
obviously, but also a surfer.

00:35:32.030 --> 00:35:34.430
So if you can surf
and snowboard,

00:35:34.430 --> 00:35:36.980
you'll pick it up pretty
quickly because surfing, I mean,

00:35:36.980 --> 00:35:40.580
you learn that middle balance
point because, you know,

00:35:40.580 --> 00:35:43.000
learning to surf, it feels
like you're-- you're on ice.

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:43.850
It's just crazy.

00:35:43.850 --> 00:35:45.740
But you really learn to
kind of balance over.

00:35:45.740 --> 00:35:47.570
And that's a key
thing in the beginning

00:35:47.570 --> 00:35:49.319
because when we start
people on the board,

00:35:49.319 --> 00:35:51.650
we don't put them under the
footholds in the beginning

00:35:51.650 --> 00:35:52.970
because, you know, they've
got to kind of learn

00:35:52.970 --> 00:35:54.080
how to bail off.

00:35:54.080 --> 00:35:57.320
And so without those footholds
to pull the board around,

00:35:57.320 --> 00:36:00.220
you really have to maintain
that center balance.

00:36:00.220 --> 00:36:03.470
And we find that surfers
do really well with that.

00:36:03.470 --> 00:36:06.260
So, like, people from Brazil
just jump on the board,

00:36:06.260 --> 00:36:08.390
and they're just like gone.

00:36:08.390 --> 00:36:10.370
They pick it up really quickly.

00:36:10.370 --> 00:36:12.110
AUDIENCE: How much
is this board?

00:36:12.110 --> 00:36:16.370
AARON ADERS: So the 10-mile
model starts at $1,549,

00:36:16.370 --> 00:36:18.830
and, hopefully, if you're
watching this video,

00:36:18.830 --> 00:36:20.649
in a few years, it's a lot less.

00:36:20.649 --> 00:36:22.190
AUDIENCE: OK, and
then last question,

00:36:22.190 --> 00:36:24.835
so I remember a while
ago I saw this--

00:36:24.835 --> 00:36:26.210
I don't know if
this-- maybe this

00:36:26.210 --> 00:36:28.312
is the same company, Freebord?

00:36:28.312 --> 00:36:29.020
AARON ADERS: Yes.

00:36:29.020 --> 00:36:30.519
AUDIENCE: Basically,
it looks like--

00:36:30.519 --> 00:36:32.990
kind of looks like this
just without the motor.

00:36:32.990 --> 00:36:35.027
AARON ADERS: Yeah,
so, really, I mean,

00:36:35.027 --> 00:36:37.110
we definitely invented a
few things along the way.

00:36:37.110 --> 00:36:40.970
But, I mean, at a high level,
we just took existing tech

00:36:40.970 --> 00:36:43.530
and just put it in, combined
it in different ways.

00:36:43.530 --> 00:36:47.030
So the Freebord
plus the Boosted,

00:36:47.030 --> 00:36:48.760
you can kind of think of--

00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:51.135
AUDIENCE: Yeah, because I
remember thinking like at that,

00:36:51.135 --> 00:36:53.820
like, oh, I wish it would
just go and flatten.

00:36:53.820 --> 00:36:54.440
So--

00:36:54.440 --> 00:36:57.450
AARON ADERS: Yeah, no, when I
saw that for the first time,

00:36:57.450 --> 00:36:59.690
it was like, I've never
had a religious experience,

00:36:59.690 --> 00:37:02.180
but when I saw that,
it was like, it just--

00:37:02.180 --> 00:37:03.527
it was incredible.

00:37:03.527 --> 00:37:05.360
But then I did some
research, and, well, you

00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:07.484
have to have a hill, and
I was living in Manhattan,

00:37:07.484 --> 00:37:08.680
and there's like no hills.

00:37:08.680 --> 00:37:11.030
I was even going to buy just
[INAUDIBLE] in a parking

00:37:11.030 --> 00:37:11.530
garage.

00:37:11.530 --> 00:37:13.220
But as a skateboarder,
I know you

00:37:13.220 --> 00:37:15.800
get kicked out of parking
garages, like, instantly.

00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:17.810
So I was kind of
back to square one,

00:37:17.810 --> 00:37:20.120
but, you know, Boosted came out.

00:37:20.120 --> 00:37:23.420
And they were the first to use
the AC motors, these really

00:37:23.420 --> 00:37:24.730
tiny motors.

00:37:24.730 --> 00:37:28.760
And I got one, and I was like,
OK, I think it's possible now.

00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:32.750
But, again, that-- you know,
strapping it to a caster wheel,

00:37:32.750 --> 00:37:35.120
no one thought that was
possible, absolutely

00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:35.930
zero, nobody.

00:37:43.380 --> 00:37:47.250
AUDIENCE: So do you think people
can use this to like train

00:37:47.250 --> 00:37:49.110
for snowboarding?

00:37:49.110 --> 00:37:50.940
Like someone who
wants a snowboard

00:37:50.940 --> 00:37:54.220
but doesn't know
how to do it yet?

00:37:54.220 --> 00:37:57.450
AARON ADERS: Yeah,
so we definitely--

00:37:57.450 --> 00:38:00.230
we want to be the gateway
drug to snowboarding,

00:38:00.230 --> 00:38:03.210
you know, for people in
areas that don't have snow.

00:38:03.210 --> 00:38:06.084
And I love so
snowboarding so much.

00:38:06.084 --> 00:38:08.250
And I just respect the sport
so much that, you know,

00:38:08.250 --> 00:38:10.800
when we launched,
I felt inherently

00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:12.270
that this could
make people better.

00:38:12.270 --> 00:38:14.521
But I didn't want to
make that claim up front,

00:38:14.521 --> 00:38:16.770
saying this is going to make
you a better snowboarder.

00:38:16.770 --> 00:38:18.450
But that is the
feedback we're getting

00:38:18.450 --> 00:38:21.300
from our customers, especially
people that have only

00:38:21.300 --> 00:38:24.390
been a couple times, and
they're really new to the sport,

00:38:24.390 --> 00:38:28.440
and they get the LEIF, and,
you know, one of my favorites

00:38:28.440 --> 00:38:30.660
was a customer we
have in Singapore

00:38:30.660 --> 00:38:32.520
that he'd been on
a couple trips,

00:38:32.520 --> 00:38:35.017
was just obsessed with
the sport, got our board.

00:38:35.017 --> 00:38:36.600
He went he went on
a snowboarding trip

00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:40.280
with some buddies,
meanwhile, bought our board,

00:38:40.280 --> 00:38:42.990
and he got back to Singapore,
rode his board for three weeks,

00:38:42.990 --> 00:38:46.410
went on another snowboarding
trip with the same buddies,

00:38:46.410 --> 00:38:49.230
and they all were, like,
you just had a whole season.

00:38:49.230 --> 00:38:49.995
What happened?

00:38:49.995 --> 00:38:51.660
Like, you got way better.

00:38:51.660 --> 00:38:53.225
And that's the thing.

00:38:53.225 --> 00:38:54.600
I mean, when you're
snowboarding,

00:38:54.600 --> 00:38:58.381
when you take into account lift
lines, and lifts, and lunch,

00:38:58.381 --> 00:38:59.880
and, you know, the
first day, you're

00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:02.160
going to be smoked in the
first couple of hours.

00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:05.040
You might only have of
like real actual riding,

00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:07.210
you know, just a
few hours a day.

00:39:07.210 --> 00:39:10.800
And so, you know, if you
can get out with the LEIF

00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:13.030
and one battery will
last you a few hours,

00:39:13.030 --> 00:39:15.238
and you can charge that a
couple times a day, I mean,

00:39:15.238 --> 00:39:18.900
you can get seasons of
riding in literally weeks.

00:39:18.900 --> 00:39:21.720
So, yeah, we were really happy
to see that it was actually

00:39:21.720 --> 00:39:24.600
improving people's riding.

00:39:24.600 --> 00:39:27.659
And when we were in New York,
we actually had somebody.

00:39:27.659 --> 00:39:29.700
There was this [INAUDIBLE]
called us up and said,

00:39:29.700 --> 00:39:33.580
hey, I've got to be at
this snowboarding mountain

00:39:33.580 --> 00:39:35.820
to kind of do a customer
meeting and ride with them,

00:39:35.820 --> 00:39:37.710
and I don't know
how to snowboard.

00:39:37.710 --> 00:39:41.580
If I buy your board, can I
get up to speed and learn?

00:39:41.580 --> 00:39:44.230
And I was, like,
yeah, I think so.

00:39:44.230 --> 00:39:46.620
And we actually connected him
with one of our pro riders

00:39:46.620 --> 00:39:48.450
in New York to kind
of show him the ropes,

00:39:48.450 --> 00:39:50.370
and I love to close
a deal, but I'm--

00:39:50.370 --> 00:39:53.540
but he was super happy
and actually rode.

00:39:53.540 --> 00:39:56.920
So, yeah, it can definitely
get you into the sport.

00:40:04.180 --> 00:40:06.070
AUDIENCE: So when
you ali, do you

00:40:06.070 --> 00:40:10.270
try to land on the front
wheels because if you

00:40:10.270 --> 00:40:15.340
land on the motors, it
might easily damage it.

00:40:15.340 --> 00:40:19.030
AARON ADERS: Actually, all
the force bypasses the motors.

00:40:19.030 --> 00:40:22.014
So you actually want
to land on your base.

00:40:22.014 --> 00:40:22.930
AUDIENCE: OK, so flat.

00:40:22.930 --> 00:40:24.880
AARON ADERS: Yeah, I mean a more
experienced rider can kind of

00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:27.070
land on an edge or
something like that,

00:40:27.070 --> 00:40:29.310
but landing flat is really
what you want to do,

00:40:29.310 --> 00:40:32.320
and, yeah, you're coming
down on those casters.

00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:34.870
But the way that the
mechanical system,

00:40:34.870 --> 00:40:39.060
you might be able to tell,
if I could pause this,

00:40:39.060 --> 00:40:40.780
it's an animated GIF.

00:40:40.780 --> 00:40:43.860
But the motor is really
just kind of hanging off

00:40:43.860 --> 00:40:45.300
a mount on the front.

00:40:45.300 --> 00:40:48.360
And so all of that load is
going straight through the wheel

00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:50.209
into the deck, and
you know, through you,

00:40:50.209 --> 00:40:51.000
and then back down.

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:52.740
But it kind of
bypasses that motor.

00:40:52.740 --> 00:40:54.656
Really, the motor is
just kind of hanging off.

00:40:54.656 --> 00:40:57.450
And the only load on the motor
is the timing belt. So it's

00:40:57.450 --> 00:41:00.990
built. I mean, we've
done seven stair gaps,

00:41:00.990 --> 00:41:04.240
which is, you know,
maybe, yeah high.

00:41:04.240 --> 00:41:07.320
And, yeah, it's
so funny, you just

00:41:07.320 --> 00:41:10.890
have to like channel
that snowboarding

00:41:10.890 --> 00:41:12.360
feeling and those mechanics.

00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:15.520
If you approach like something
new, it's super scary.

00:41:15.520 --> 00:41:17.430
But if you feel like,
oh, this is, you know,

00:41:17.430 --> 00:41:18.390
just imagine the snow.

00:41:18.390 --> 00:41:22.110
Like, channel your five-year-old
self and like see the snow,

00:41:22.110 --> 00:41:23.670
it just magically works.

00:41:23.670 --> 00:41:24.340
It's crazy.

00:41:24.340 --> 00:41:26.400
AUDIENCE: OK, so when
you're dropping down

00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:31.350
from seven stairs, do you land
like power slide or more like a

00:41:31.350 --> 00:41:32.490
skateboard?

00:41:32.490 --> 00:41:33.800
AARON ADERS: You can.

00:41:33.800 --> 00:41:37.145
In fact, one of our riders,
his name is Slide Jump Slide.

00:41:37.145 --> 00:41:40.570
He these slides, jumps,
and lands on a slide.

00:41:40.570 --> 00:41:43.240
But, yeah, it's a super
challenging trick.

00:41:43.240 --> 00:41:45.180
But, yeah, it's definitely.

00:41:45.180 --> 00:41:47.640
I mean, that's like the great
thing about snowboarding,

00:41:47.640 --> 00:41:50.910
and our board is like there's
this endless progression

00:41:50.910 --> 00:41:52.710
and endless styles.

00:41:52.710 --> 00:41:55.980
And so, yeah, you can land
sideways if you really want to.

00:41:55.980 --> 00:41:57.270
AUDIENCE: OK, cool, thanks.

00:42:03.854 --> 00:42:05.020
AARON ADERS: Oh, do we have?

00:42:05.020 --> 00:42:07.632
OK.

00:42:07.632 --> 00:42:10.090
AUDIENCE: You talk a little
bit about the-- your industrial

00:42:10.090 --> 00:42:12.760
design process,
and you talk a lot

00:42:12.760 --> 00:42:17.290
about wanting to mirror the
experience of snowboarding.

00:42:17.290 --> 00:42:18.790
So how did you think
about that when

00:42:18.790 --> 00:42:22.540
you were designing the board and
communicating the visual design

00:42:22.540 --> 00:42:25.780
to a consumer that may not,
you know, have seen the video?

00:42:25.780 --> 00:42:30.820
AARON ADERS: For sure, so for
us, you know, to call this--

00:42:30.820 --> 00:42:31.690
I'm a snowboarder.

00:42:31.690 --> 00:42:33.090
And if this didn't
feel like snowboarding,

00:42:33.090 --> 00:42:34.522
I would have zero
interest in it.

00:42:34.522 --> 00:42:36.730
And so in the beginning,
that's-- it's kind of how we

00:42:36.730 --> 00:42:37.300
got our name.

00:42:37.300 --> 00:42:41.290
So the Turing test of our
board was being able to--

00:42:41.290 --> 00:42:42.880
like falling leaf
down the street.

00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:45.414
So that's the first
move you learn on snow.

00:42:45.414 --> 00:42:47.830
You're just kind of like a
falling leaf down the mountain.

00:42:47.830 --> 00:42:50.080
And so our board had to do that.

00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:54.010
Nothing else can falling
leaf down a city street.

00:42:54.010 --> 00:42:57.550
And so we just kept iterating
and getting into where we

00:42:57.550 --> 00:42:59.200
had enough torque to do that.

00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:02.080
In the beginning, we were--
we were literally burning

00:43:02.080 --> 00:43:03.250
the coils of the motors.

00:43:03.250 --> 00:43:06.640
But it takes a lot of torque,
a powered caster wheel.

00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:10.120
But in terms of the
industrial design,

00:43:10.120 --> 00:43:13.000
honestly, for the
first version, you

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:16.960
can kind of tell the generation
of the person that designed it.

00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:19.391
It kind of looks like
a first NES, or maybe

00:43:19.391 --> 00:43:20.890
the first Playstation,
or something,

00:43:20.890 --> 00:43:25.400
this real edgy, dark,
you know, device.

00:43:25.400 --> 00:43:28.540
But I think that, you know,
when you see it, and--

00:43:28.540 --> 00:43:30.540
and this-- this thing
popping out of the middle.

00:43:30.540 --> 00:43:32.998
I mean, obviously, you're not
going to put your feet there,

00:43:32.998 --> 00:43:35.200
but you know, your feet
are-- you kind of have

00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:37.750
like a notion of-- of kind
of how to stand on it,

00:43:37.750 --> 00:43:40.360
just-- just naturally where
that grip tape is and things.

00:43:40.360 --> 00:43:43.510
But, yeah, I think
with future versions,

00:43:43.510 --> 00:43:46.570
it can be a little bit
maybe more communicated

00:43:46.570 --> 00:43:48.040
like a snowboard.

00:43:48.040 --> 00:43:51.530
Also, you can't really tell
in this photo, but there's--

00:43:51.530 --> 00:43:52.750
it's just bi-directional.

00:43:52.750 --> 00:43:56.390
There's technically
no front to the board.

00:43:56.390 --> 00:44:00.170
We do have some traction
control for beginners.

00:44:00.170 --> 00:44:02.530
So we're sensing which
direction the board's

00:44:02.530 --> 00:44:06.190
going and applying
power relative

00:44:06.190 --> 00:44:07.510
to that, that direction.

00:44:07.510 --> 00:44:09.010
So if you-- you
know, if you switch,

00:44:09.010 --> 00:44:11.440
won't have like
anti-traction control.

00:44:11.440 --> 00:44:13.240
It's got to-- it's got
to follow with you,

00:44:13.240 --> 00:44:14.632
if you go the other way.

00:44:14.632 --> 00:44:16.090
And I think that
kind of helps too,

00:44:16.090 --> 00:44:17.430
because when they
get out the box, so,

00:44:17.430 --> 00:44:18.660
you know, which way is forward?

00:44:18.660 --> 00:44:19.576
But it doesn't matter.

00:44:19.576 --> 00:44:21.580
It just, it knows
which way is forward?

00:44:21.580 --> 00:44:24.790
But I I think there's--
yeah, definitely design wise,

00:44:24.790 --> 00:44:28.240
we can pick up a lot
more in the next version.

00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:30.460
AUDIENCE: And one
other unrelated

00:44:30.460 --> 00:44:34.510
question you mentioned that
you started up in New York

00:44:34.510 --> 00:44:37.000
and this genre of
product immediately

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:38.515
made me think of
Casey Neistat, who

00:44:38.515 --> 00:44:42.040
is a very popular YouTuber
that's always messing around

00:44:42.040 --> 00:44:46.300
with electric, you know,
modes of transportation.

00:44:46.300 --> 00:44:48.274
Has he tried this yet?

00:44:48.274 --> 00:44:49.690
AARON ADERS: You
know, it's funny.

00:44:49.690 --> 00:44:52.690
We-- I don't think
he's tried it.

00:44:52.690 --> 00:44:55.270
We actually ran into him
when we were beta testing.

00:44:55.270 --> 00:44:58.840
It was like 10 degrees
January, New York.

00:44:58.840 --> 00:45:02.580
And there was nobody out
except one of our beta riders.

00:45:02.580 --> 00:45:03.970
It was actually my brother.

00:45:03.970 --> 00:45:06.452
And he was testing along--

00:45:06.452 --> 00:45:07.910
I don't if you've
been to New York,

00:45:07.910 --> 00:45:08.860
but there's like
the Freedom Tower,

00:45:08.860 --> 00:45:10.420
and there's this huge bike lane.

00:45:10.420 --> 00:45:11.980
It's really nice and smooth.

00:45:11.980 --> 00:45:13.910
And if it's 10 degrees
out, nobody's on it.

00:45:13.910 --> 00:45:17.865
So he was out there going,
and Casey was actually--

00:45:17.865 --> 00:45:21.470
you know how he rides his
board and films himself,

00:45:21.470 --> 00:45:25.780
and he came up on our beta
rider, and, of course,

00:45:25.780 --> 00:45:27.230
like, he threw this huge slide.

00:45:27.230 --> 00:45:28.360
It was like, whoa!

00:45:28.360 --> 00:45:29.260
What is that?

00:45:29.260 --> 00:45:32.020
And he stopped him,
and he actually put us

00:45:32.020 --> 00:45:35.470
on his daily blog that day.

00:45:35.470 --> 00:45:37.000
And, yeah, our site
was just like--

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:39.041
I mean, it was like 12,000
visitors in the first,

00:45:39.041 --> 00:45:41.980
you know, 20 minutes
after he posted that.

00:45:41.980 --> 00:45:43.480
And all he did was just--

00:45:43.480 --> 00:45:46.570
luckily, my brother had like
one of our promo cards on him

00:45:46.570 --> 00:45:49.924
and just floated that out there,
and we had a ton of traffic.

00:45:49.924 --> 00:45:51.340
And he's a big
snowboarder, and he

00:45:51.340 --> 00:45:52.756
does this like
street snowboarding

00:45:52.756 --> 00:45:54.879
thing where he takes like a--

00:45:54.879 --> 00:45:55.420
I don't know.

00:45:55.420 --> 00:45:57.910
I think it's like a water
ski rope behind a car

00:45:57.910 --> 00:45:59.110
and snowboards around.

00:45:59.110 --> 00:46:02.380
So this is like a lot
better for that than that.

00:46:02.380 --> 00:46:05.080
But, yeah, he's kind
of the perfect person.

00:46:05.080 --> 00:46:07.150
I know that he's really
involved with Boosted.

00:46:07.150 --> 00:46:10.190
So I'm not sure if he has
much interest, but maybe.

00:46:17.060 --> 00:46:19.380
AUDIENCE: So you said something
about traction control,

00:46:19.380 --> 00:46:21.421
and I was wondering if
you could say a few things

00:46:21.421 --> 00:46:24.500
about the hardware that's
inside kind of controlling

00:46:24.500 --> 00:46:25.880
the motors a little bit?

00:46:25.880 --> 00:46:27.290
AARON ADERS: Yeah, totally.

00:46:27.290 --> 00:46:30.440
So the traction control
is remarkably symbol.

00:46:30.440 --> 00:46:33.132
Basically, you know, when
you're going on to turn a car,

00:46:33.132 --> 00:46:35.090
and you start to slide
out, then you, you know,

00:46:35.090 --> 00:46:37.313
slow down those back wheels,
and kind of, you know,

00:46:37.313 --> 00:46:39.480
lessens that slide
out a little bit.

00:46:39.480 --> 00:46:41.880
And so what we do is basically
the same exact thing.

00:46:41.880 --> 00:46:45.530
We're just slowing
down the back wheel.

00:46:45.530 --> 00:46:48.140
But, again, without
being a front end,

00:46:48.140 --> 00:46:50.240
the back can kind of change.

00:46:50.240 --> 00:46:53.750
And so all, basically,
we have just a set

00:46:53.750 --> 00:46:56.450
of positive magnets on one side
instead of negative magnets

00:46:56.450 --> 00:46:59.136
on the other, Hall
sensor, and, you know,

00:46:59.136 --> 00:47:01.510
if it's a positive reading,
we know we're going this way.

00:47:01.510 --> 00:47:03.960
If it's negative reading, we
know we're going that way.

00:47:03.960 --> 00:47:06.410
And then if that
changes, you just

00:47:06.410 --> 00:47:09.050
change the power
going to each motor.

00:47:09.050 --> 00:47:11.690
It happens in milliseconds.

00:47:11.690 --> 00:47:13.280
And it's remarkably simple.

00:47:13.280 --> 00:47:17.890
I just like literally
one Hall sensor,

00:47:17.890 --> 00:47:21.500
and I, actually, there's like
an organization around Hall

00:47:21.500 --> 00:47:23.850
sensors and MEMS and sensors.

00:47:23.850 --> 00:47:26.300
And they found out somehow
we're using that, and I went,

00:47:26.300 --> 00:47:29.510
and I did a presentation at
one of their conferences.

00:47:29.510 --> 00:47:31.190
And they were super
excited until they

00:47:31.190 --> 00:47:33.377
find I only had one Hall
sensor in the board,

00:47:33.377 --> 00:47:35.210
and they were I think
a little disappointed.

00:47:35.210 --> 00:47:38.270
They wanted to buy
more because there

00:47:38.270 --> 00:47:41.270
are people with MRI machines
with thousands of Hall sensors.

00:47:41.270 --> 00:47:45.020
And so, yeah, that was kind
of unexpected and funny.

00:47:58.930 --> 00:48:00.430
AUDIENCE: Hey, I
was just wondering,

00:48:00.430 --> 00:48:04.290
have you guys thought at
all about maybe this product

00:48:04.290 --> 00:48:08.220
in the context of how like
a skate park might evolve?

00:48:08.220 --> 00:48:12.540
And, specifically, I'm thinking
about how skate jumps are very

00:48:12.540 --> 00:48:14.370
different, like,
it's a very different

00:48:14.370 --> 00:48:17.460
than like a proper snowboard
kicker, you know, the landing,

00:48:17.460 --> 00:48:19.590
and how that works, and
is there any thought of,

00:48:19.590 --> 00:48:21.570
like, would this
kind of a product

00:48:21.570 --> 00:48:23.220
work in that kind
of environment,

00:48:23.220 --> 00:48:27.510
not just in like, you know,
hitting stair gaps and rails,

00:48:27.510 --> 00:48:30.370
but also more
snowboard-style jumps?

00:48:30.370 --> 00:48:31.620
AARON ADERS: Yeah, definitely.

00:48:31.620 --> 00:48:34.350
So have you ever
heard of a pump track?

00:48:34.350 --> 00:48:35.500
So it's like these--

00:48:35.500 --> 00:48:37.270
this little track
that's got these bumps.

00:48:37.270 --> 00:48:38.070
And if you're on
a skateboard, you

00:48:38.070 --> 00:48:40.830
can kind of like pump and
keep momentum going around.

00:48:40.830 --> 00:48:43.470
We thought those would
be great, but the scale

00:48:43.470 --> 00:48:44.650
was just far too small.

00:48:44.650 --> 00:48:46.651
It was, you know, built
for a little skateboard.

00:48:46.651 --> 00:48:48.275
And with snowboarding,
you know, you've

00:48:48.275 --> 00:48:50.310
got these massive runs
that are like, you know,

00:48:50.310 --> 00:48:54.360
sometimes 10 lanes wide and,
you know, carving across those,

00:48:54.360 --> 00:48:56.620
I mean, it's just-- you know,
it makes your whole day.

00:48:56.620 --> 00:49:00.390
And so there is definitely
like a larger scale that

00:49:00.390 --> 00:49:05.730
needs to happen with that, and
with the skate park, for me,

00:49:05.730 --> 00:49:08.850
I like more like flat
transition, so maybe more

00:49:08.850 --> 00:49:11.670
like a pyramid rather
than like a quarter pipe.

00:49:11.670 --> 00:49:15.000
I do find that curve,
at least for me,

00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:16.590
maybe my skills
aren't good enough.

00:49:16.590 --> 00:49:19.110
But it kind of freaks me out.

00:49:19.110 --> 00:49:21.630
And, you know, I've never really
tried that on a snowboard,

00:49:21.630 --> 00:49:22.680
so I couldn't really tell you.

00:49:22.680 --> 00:49:24.179
But what I do want
to know, and what

00:49:24.179 --> 00:49:27.120
I love doing on this board is
more like, what would be great

00:49:27.120 --> 00:49:29.400
is like a pyramid that
would be like the size

00:49:29.400 --> 00:49:32.134
of this room with huge
walls that, you know,

00:49:32.134 --> 00:49:33.690
kind of transition.

00:49:33.690 --> 00:49:35.020
Those are super fun.

00:49:35.020 --> 00:49:37.590
And I think that
definitely someday there

00:49:37.590 --> 00:49:40.110
will be kind of a
park meant for these,

00:49:40.110 --> 00:49:43.560
but I think it's going to be at
a much larger scale just given

00:49:43.560 --> 00:49:46.150
kind of how snowboarding works
and the fun parts of that.

00:49:50.870 --> 00:49:52.820
Yeah, and on that
note, actually, we--

00:49:52.820 --> 00:49:54.830
you know, Prospect
Park in Brooklyn,

00:49:54.830 --> 00:49:56.579
I don't know if anybody's
ever been there,

00:49:56.579 --> 00:49:58.250
but it's like a LEIF resort.

00:49:58.250 --> 00:49:59.980
It's incredible.

00:49:59.980 --> 00:50:03.140
There is a huge loop
around the park that's

00:50:03.140 --> 00:50:05.570
like four to six lanes
wide that's super fun

00:50:05.570 --> 00:50:07.230
to carve and get up to speed.

00:50:07.230 --> 00:50:09.480
But then there's all these
little paths in the middle.

00:50:09.480 --> 00:50:13.074
And so it's a very
different experience,

00:50:13.074 --> 00:50:14.990
you know, traveling
through these little paths

00:50:14.990 --> 00:50:18.612
and going on the big outer ring.

00:50:18.612 --> 00:50:20.320
But, you know, that's
kind of fun to kind

00:50:20.320 --> 00:50:21.319
of experience with that.

00:50:21.319 --> 00:50:24.930
But when we came to Los
Angeles, and, you know,

00:50:24.930 --> 00:50:28.650
we rode up Griffith Park, which
is one of our favorite runs.

00:50:28.650 --> 00:50:30.530
I mean, that was an even--

00:50:30.530 --> 00:50:32.750
I'd never like used
the same product

00:50:32.750 --> 00:50:34.885
and had such a
different experience,

00:50:34.885 --> 00:50:37.010
you know, being on literally
the side of a mountain

00:50:37.010 --> 00:50:39.590
going up that hill
to Griffith Park.

00:50:39.590 --> 00:50:42.890
And so it's-- it
just blew our minds.

00:50:42.890 --> 00:50:43.790
It was way different.

00:50:43.790 --> 00:50:46.070
And I think there's just
so many different contexts

00:50:46.070 --> 00:50:47.210
you can enjoy this board.

00:50:47.210 --> 00:50:51.969
But I think that bigger,
wider is really nice.

00:50:51.969 --> 00:50:54.260
AUDIENCE: How easy is it to
bring the board on a plane?

00:50:55.475 --> 00:50:56.790
AARON ADERS: Yeah so we--

00:50:56.790 --> 00:50:59.690
we designed the
batteries so that they're

00:50:59.690 --> 00:51:02.510
compliant with TSA regulations.

00:51:02.510 --> 00:51:05.944
And so I usually
carry on the board.

00:51:05.944 --> 00:51:07.610
You always have to
carry on the battery,

00:51:07.610 --> 00:51:09.890
and the remote controls,
there's a battery inside.

00:51:09.890 --> 00:51:11.810
You can check the
board if you like.

00:51:11.810 --> 00:51:13.580
I've actually carried
on two boards.

00:51:13.580 --> 00:51:17.560
They were super annoyed, but
they let me through with it.

00:51:17.560 --> 00:51:19.880
And, yeah, it just
fits in the overhead.

00:51:19.880 --> 00:51:22.760
And a lot of our customers
take them everywhere,

00:51:22.760 --> 00:51:26.300
and that was, you know, a key
feature we really had to have.

00:51:26.300 --> 00:51:28.550
And that's why you see our
battery packs are actually

00:51:28.550 --> 00:51:31.640
two batteries because to stay
under the watt hour limit,

00:51:31.640 --> 00:51:32.900
we had to split the pack.

00:51:32.900 --> 00:51:34.610
And we can get a
lot more mileage

00:51:34.610 --> 00:51:37.880
and stay under that limit.

00:51:37.880 --> 00:51:40.260
Everybody read ride?

00:51:40.260 --> 00:51:42.591
Cool, let's do it.

00:51:42.591 --> 00:51:43.465
[APPLAUSE]

00:51:44.340 --> 00:51:46.490
Appreciate it.
