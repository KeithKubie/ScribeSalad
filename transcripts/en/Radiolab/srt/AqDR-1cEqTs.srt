1
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:06,440
Listening to radio lab radio from W N Y.

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,970
S. C. Yep. Hello,

3
00:00:11,971 --> 00:00:14,880
I'm Jet Apple Rod. I'm
Robert Krulwich, Radiolab,

4
00:00:14,881 --> 00:00:19,560
and today we have a story from a
longtime contributor of ours, uh,

5
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:22,590
who's up to something new these
days. A Gregory Warner. Yes.

6
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:23,970
If you've listened to this program,

7
00:00:23,971 --> 00:00:26,460
you know his work because he's
been on our show so many times.

8
00:00:26,461 --> 00:00:30,330
He brought us stories from upstate
New York about faith healers,

9
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:31,800
thinks as 12 years ago.

10
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:35,010
Then a story from Afghanistan
about the quote Afghan Elvis,

11
00:00:35,011 --> 00:00:36,450
a couple of stories from Kenya,

12
00:00:36,451 --> 00:00:41,451
one from Ethiopia and exploring a cure
to alcoholism by some crack in Moscow.

13
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:45,270
In other words, he's
like all over the place.

14
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,790
He is a foreign correspondent
for national public radio,

15
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:52,080
and recently NPR decided to
give him his own podcast.

16
00:00:52,081 --> 00:00:54,210
It's called rough
translation and it's killer,

17
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:58,230
but we're going to just begin today
with sampling one of his new pieces.

18
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:03,660
It again takes us to a peculiar place
with an improbable result. Yeah.

19
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:04,943
Here's Greg Warner.

20
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:09,160
The six months before Mohammad went to
prison with the best six months of his

21
00:01:09,161 --> 00:01:09,994
life,

22
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:14,230
he'd landed this great job managing a
Pepsi plant and he'd found true love on

23
00:01:14,231 --> 00:01:18,130
his first date. We went to a small
restaurant, where do we leave?

24
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,820
Her name was Ismahan 20 years
old teller at a state bank.

25
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:27,140
I know we were talking and shyly of
course, you know, she was British I and,

26
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:32,950
and we realized we want
to get married. That's it.

27
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,840
Love it for censored in a sense. Yeah.

28
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:41,100
[inaudible]

29
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:45,270
Mohammad said he was just so struck
by how generous she was smart and they

30
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:48,940
connected about everything from the
future of their country to the music they

31
00:01:48,941 --> 00:01:52,470
liked. Whatever images the
word Somalia calls to mind.

32
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:55,950
The Somalia where Muhammad lived
was in a cultural renaissance.

33
00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:00,120
This was 1981 it was under
communist rule and the dictator,

34
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:04,320
he was a dictator, but he was also a
big fan of Somali culture in music.

35
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:07,950
Music was sexually a big part of
how Mohammad courted his Mohan.

36
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:12,800
He made her mix tapes. This was the
80s to song sense, stuff like that.

37
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:16,900
Yeah. Did you sing or did she
say, oh, she's a bit to sing?

38
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:22,780
[inaudible]

39
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:25,360
a few months after Mohammad
and his mom got married,

40
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:29,470
Mohammed got a phone call from the
director of the local public hospital.

41
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:33,850
Please help me bring some
donations from the communities.

42
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:38,290
He was desperate for donations
or medicine for bedding. In fact,

43
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:41,470
that music loving dictator,
his name was, see at Bari,

44
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:45,610
he'd cut off supplies to the hospital
in retaliation for an independence

45
00:02:45,611 --> 00:02:49,240
movement in the region. The doctor had
been calling all his friends and secret.

46
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:52,570
Yeah. We were talking a little time
saying, you know, you work for Pepsi,

47
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,400
you have connections,
you know, people can,

48
00:02:54,401 --> 00:02:59,290
we raise the money discreetly ourselves.
But Mohammad wanted to go big.

49
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,450
I suppose maybe I wanted
to share my happiness.

50
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:05,440
What do you mean by share your
happiness? You know, contribute.

51
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:08,260
Cause there are other people
who are less fortunate than us.

52
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:12,220
Mohammed was in that stage of new love
when you just kinda think the world is

53
00:03:12,221 --> 00:03:15,070
full of good feeling. And if
everybody knew what was going on,

54
00:03:15,071 --> 00:03:19,030
they would do the right thing. And he
takes this bold and pretty risky move.

55
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:20,620
He writes a letter,

56
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:25,120
some kind of a nice letter about
the hospital conditions. Yes.

57
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,980
Filling the conditions of the country,

58
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,880
essentially implying that the dictator
is not doing right by us and we've got to

59
00:03:30,881 --> 00:03:33,160
step up ourselves. A
couple of weeks later,

60
00:03:33,161 --> 00:03:36,820
Mohammed and spawn heard a knock on
their door in the middle of the night,

61
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:40,570
national security to be one. They don't
have no warrant or anything like that.

62
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:45,880
It's just said we needed to take
him and I could see that my wife

63
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,690
actually member had it and had eyes

64
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:55,450
what was in her eyes? No love

65
00:03:58,420 --> 00:03:59,380
the tariff.

66
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,750
Mohammad is accused of
treason and sentenced the
life in solitary confinement,

67
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:11,350
blindfold handcuff and sent to a seven
and this is where the story really

68
00:04:14,691 --> 00:04:17,810
begins. Mohammed cell is tiny,

69
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:22,930
maybe six feet by six feet concrete walls
hole on the floor for a toilet and a

70
00:04:23,331 --> 00:04:24,164
window

71
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:26,440
high up that lets in just
a little bit of light.

72
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:31,420
It's very dark and cook
roots come from the toilet,

73
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:34,360
cockroaches, cook carrots and
they will fly off the wall,

74
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:39,210
which you and split them
into their feet. Sweet.

75
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:43,960
The on their feet would be excreted
from the toilet. Yeah. Yes, yes.

76
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:49,120
After the cockroaches come the rats
at the mice and the mosquitoes,

77
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:53,140
the most of the mosquitoes.
Oh, like an engine jet engine.

78
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:58,630
But even worse than that sound now
is the buzzing in his own mind.

79
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:01,350
Uh,

80
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:06,180
because in this prison there is one rule
to a strictly forbidden to talk to your

81
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:09,630
neighbor. He's forbidden to
speak to the other inmates.

82
00:05:09,631 --> 00:05:14,190
So you will faraway them
backward pacing back and forth.

83
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:18,870
And this isn't just a tiny place
to walk back and forth tee shots.

84
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:22,920
So like three short steps forward,
three shorts, those back with resources.

85
00:05:22,921 --> 00:05:23,490
Photos.

86
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:24,323
Yes.

87
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,060
So that is his life now.

88
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,753
[inaudible]

89
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,553
until one day

90
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:39,280
he hears a knock on the wall

91
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:41,410
[inaudible]

92
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:46,410
and that knock becomes words from
another time and another place.

93
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:51,670
All happy families are alike.

94
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,050
Unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.

95
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:06,230
This is rough translation. The show from
NPR bringing you Greg, are you there?

96
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:08,590
Yeah. Hey guys. Hey, we say,

97
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:11,720
do you want to just tell us what rough
translation is? Yes. So I've been, uh,

98
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:14,720
been making a podcast this year. Um,

99
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:17,960
basically the idea is that in every
episode we follow a conversation we're

100
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:22,160
having in the United States here, how
that's playing out in a different place.

101
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:26,990
One episode we might hear about how
fake news is playing out in Ukraine,

102
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:30,320
which has been getting fake news for
longer and in higher doses than anything

103
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:31,573
Americans going to imagine.

104
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:33,800
We're hearing about a trend that's
happening more and more now,

105
00:06:33,801 --> 00:06:37,700
where Chinese women are hiring American
surrogates to have their babies.

106
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:41,000
So basically every episode we're
trying to do the same thing.

107
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:45,410
It's just sort of see something we
have, see what the other folks, yeah.

108
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:48,440
Which is not like what we said.
Yeah. And I guess in this one,

109
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:53,330
we have a guy locked away in a Somali
prison. Should we just keep playing?

110
00:06:53,331 --> 00:06:55,670
See what happens? Yeah.
Yeah. It's rough translation.

111
00:06:56,150 --> 00:07:00,140
It's eight months into Mohammed's
prison sentence and he's in his cell as

112
00:07:00,141 --> 00:07:01,490
always. He's alone.

113
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:06,200
Not quite though. There were so
many different types of answers.

114
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:11,180
Swells is unseen. Tiny one is
really just like watching a film.

115
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:15,020
Gatesville the way deal.
They look around for food.

116
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:20,090
Do we have t three t should
have it when you give them time.

117
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,470
It's another world

118
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:27,710
I would have loved to go
see at that hill. They're,

119
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:29,840
they're homeless. They
where they were staying,

120
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:32,660
but I couldn't because it was so concrete.

121
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:37,170
And then one evening when the guard is
at the other end of the line of cells,

122
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:41,160
just out of your shot, the guy in
the cell next to Muhammad whispers.

123
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:46,010
So with the door saying lan
a, B, c through the wall,
then ABC through the wall,

124
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:50,580
learn a, B, c through the
wall. But he remembers and,

125
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:53,370
and does that make any sense to
Muhammad at that one 0 million cents?

126
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:58,880
I look at the world between. So, but
then, but then he knocked on the wall

127
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:00,970
[inaudible]

128
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:03,370
and when Mohammed leaned over to the wall,

129
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:06,970
he could hear this sound that's shot

130
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:09,360
that too.

131
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:13,240
So you have a sharp sound
and a kind of dull sound.

132
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:18,190
And with those two sounds, he immediately
clicks. Oh, this is the alphabet.

133
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:21,160
Oh, this is the guy saying,
learn this code, this code.

134
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,513
Yeah.

135
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:25,350
Yes, I understand that.
And he starts with this,

136
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:31,360
B, c, d, e,

137
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:32,770
f,

138
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:34,590
first and alphabet. And then

139
00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:37,960
words. What do you,

140
00:08:37,961 --> 00:08:40,150
what was the first
sentence that you heard?

141
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:44,860
So number, which means peace in Somalia
and what it means. How are you also,

142
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:49,800
yeah, no,

143
00:08:49,801 --> 00:08:54,801
but I could've beat that with or that
day fell without doing anything else.

144
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:56,490
And so Mohammad

145
00:08:56,490 --> 00:09:00,660
can now spend most of the day tapping
back and forth to talk with the guy in the

146
00:09:00,661 --> 00:09:04,470
next cell about politics,
to share a childhood memory.

147
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:08,520
But at night when he can't sleep,

148
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:13,710
he turns again to the concrete.
And then again, and again,

149
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:18,760
I was only sleeping few, maybe half
an hour, then wake up a half an hour.

150
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:23,560
Mohammed would wake up from a nightmare,
sweaty and in a panic, I guess.

151
00:09:23,561 --> 00:09:28,300
My sleep, are you awake? I can't sleep.

152
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:30,100
I need to talk.

153
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:34,490
[inaudible]

154
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:37,040
when I try to sleep,
when I'm falling asleep,

155
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:40,760
sitting in my heart face is so fast.

156
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:45,530
So I was thinking there was space
that this is the smell of death.

157
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:51,230
What is the smell of death? I think fear.

158
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:56,710
Mohammed had a lot of fearful
thoughts in that prison cell,

159
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:59,340
especially about his wife.

160
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:04,320
I could not imagine how how she is
because there are no news from from the

161
00:10:04,321 --> 00:10:04,920
world,

162
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:09,750
from those side where it's
really difficult to imagine
where she is even with

163
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:10,893
she's alive.

164
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,490
Then there was a meaner thought as well.

165
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:18,030
The government was encouraging
wives to be forced their husbands.

166
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:21,300
The government was saying, you should
divorce. Yes, of course, Daddy.

167
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:23,280
Three trustees write in prison.

168
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:28,200
Even some chefs from granite
faces to support that

169
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:33,310
divorce in Somali society in Islam is
usually the husband's exclusive. Right,

170
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:37,610
but there are these Quranic verses that
can allow a wife to choose to divorce

171
00:10:37,611 --> 00:10:41,210
her husband if the husband's
absent for some time and shakes.

172
00:10:41,211 --> 00:10:42,230
Loyal to the dictator,

173
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:45,890
use those verses to pressure the
wives of political prisoners.

174
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:49,290
Quite a number of people who
were forced from their request.

175
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:53,750
All right. I was thinking sometimes the
shoe could, she was only 20 years old.

176
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:57,680
They'd only been married for three
months and he was sentenced to life.

177
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:00,620
You think she's probably enjoying herself?

178
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:04,190
She's living her life
and I am in this place.

179
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:09,260
At first it's just a little twinge of
resentment and then the feeling comes back

180
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:13,610
stronger and sharper. He thinks
she should be visiting me,

181
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:16,130
but wait, she can't visit me.

182
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:19,820
Nobody come to see this place and
nobody can get in touch and he's still,

183
00:11:19,821 --> 00:11:24,821
you blame her for not getting in touch
with you and what do you think about her

184
00:11:24,891 --> 00:11:27,900
in those moments when you're
blaming her for not visiting you?

185
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:30,980
Pretty far from love.

186
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,300
You probably hate that
at that particular time.

187
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:43,130
Every time that Mohammed tapped one
of these dark thoughts onto the wall,

188
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:47,450
someone was listening and the someone
on the other side of the wall was a

189
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:48,140
doctor,

190
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:53,140
doctor at an Abacor is also an inmate in
this prison and is the doctors to these

191
00:11:53,621 --> 00:11:54,010
taps on

192
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:58,660
the wall. He's also
diagnosing them acute anxiety.

193
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:02,440
Who was telling me the
symptoms through the wall?

194
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,410
I should tell you that doctor Addon and
Mohammad were actually friends before

195
00:12:08,411 --> 00:12:11,890
prison. Yeah. Yeah. The doctor was
the director of the public hospital.

196
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,020
The one had called him up
and asked him for donations.

197
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:18,220
He did not ask Mohammed to write that
letter complaining about the hospital

198
00:12:18,221 --> 00:12:19,054
conditions

199
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:23,600
cause there were no press allowed,
no newspapers, no free press.

200
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:27,830
And that's the moment the
government decided that they
should do something about

201
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:28,690
us.

202
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:32,500
But if the doctor blames Mohammad for
writing the letter that got them both

203
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:36,190
thrown in prison, he didn't show it.
Every time that Mohammed knocked,

204
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:38,950
whatever the hour the
doctor would knock back,

205
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:42,830
he used to have these
nightmares. So he jumps,

206
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:46,040
he has a knife man and then he
knocks on the, on the wall again.

207
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:51,430
So I have to wake up and then
again start conversation, you know,

208
00:12:51,431 --> 00:12:54,860
so that they can fall asleep.
I get just like a baby,

209
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,330
you're taking a baby to Tibet and
making you fall asleep, you know?

210
00:12:59,670 --> 00:12:59,770
Okay.

211
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:04,480
If Dr add and seems fairly unsentimental
about some of the more dramatic aspects

212
00:13:04,481 --> 00:13:06,310
of Mohammed's life, just
like a baby, you know,

213
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:09,070
it's partly that these two men
are such different personalities.

214
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:13,060
While Mohammad described that nighttime
arrest as a moment of shock and terror.

215
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:17,860
Dr Adnan seems to have met those same
secret police with a bag packed and ready

216
00:13:17,861 --> 00:13:21,340
for prison and bag of clothes
and lots and lots of books.

217
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:25,220
Huh? Why books? Books is the
best friend and in a prison.

218
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,730
Then when you go to the prison that
was taken away, the bag was taken away.

219
00:13:28,731 --> 00:13:30,290
Even old glasses were taken away.

220
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:32,763
So

221
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:37,590
tell me about the day you learn the
language. Learn the knocking language.

222
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:38,543
Well,

223
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:39,990
okay.

224
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:42,150
It was the most exciting day in our life.

225
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:43,613
Okay.

226
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,250
This was the most exciting and
we couldn't sleep. Wait, so Greg,

227
00:13:48,251 --> 00:13:50,260
let me ask this. This knocking,
this is something that they are,

228
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:51,940
they all were doing together. Yeah.

229
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:55,470
Particular Line of Eight prisoners.
So these eight prisoners,

230
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,880
there was a particular guy in the,

231
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,000
in the middle there who had once heard
of Morse code and just lying there in

232
00:14:02,611 --> 00:14:06,390
prison one day thought, hey, what if I
indent the language and we can talk? Oh,

233
00:14:06,391 --> 00:14:10,380
so this was actually a homespun?
Yeah, he did not know Morse code.

234
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:13,810
He just knew of it. And the guards
couldn't hear that. That was some,

235
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:17,400
that was their own right. I
mean literally they could,

236
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:21,450
this was kind of the magic of it. They
could be just tapping on the wall.

237
00:14:21,451 --> 00:14:26,250
They could be having a whole conversation
and the guard would have no idea what

238
00:14:26,251 --> 00:14:27,540
they were saying.

239
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:32,390
We started practicing in the whole day
and the whole night and if there is a

240
00:14:32,391 --> 00:14:37,391
joke and somebody loves everybody starts
knocking on the wall and asking that

241
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:42,200
thread was that joke about that
that guy starts sending the message,

242
00:14:42,201 --> 00:14:43,720
the joke and it goes from,

243
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:47,890
I could take an hour to send a tiny joke
from one cell to the next cell to the

244
00:14:47,891 --> 00:14:52,040
next, there were eight of them in
this prison. The gods, of course, they

245
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,470
don't know that we are knocking on
the wall because they can't hear.

246
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:57,880
And then when they see us all laughing,
they just say, well, this get it.

247
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:01,070
These guys are also losing their sanity.

248
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:03,720
Meanwhile, on the other side of the wall,

249
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:06,800
Mohammed really was worried
that his mind was slipping.

250
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:12,420
I was frightened enough going to a safe
and area in my mind when I would commit

251
00:15:12,431 --> 00:15:15,760
suicide without knowing,
without wanting to,

252
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:20,530
is it almost like a, the fear of going
crazy? It was making me crazy. Yes.

253
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,250
The fear, the fear was,
you know you could,

254
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:27,760
you can imagine people who were crazy
and you could imagine that maybe going

255
00:15:27,761 --> 00:15:32,560
crazy was the point of no return.
So you are frightened of that

256
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,380
while the doctor on his side of the
wall and I was trying to counsel him and

257
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:41,520
explain to him through the wall and he's
not going to go with Matt and that he's

258
00:15:41,521 --> 00:15:46,350
not going to die, but you can't
cancel person through a wall.

259
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:50,510
Months go by. Then a whole year,

260
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:54,950
finally it's two years into their
prison sentence and something happens.

261
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:59,600
Dr Addin is summoned to the office of
the warden to get a change of clothes.

262
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:03,440
The room was empty and there was a bench
and they ask you to sit on the bench

263
00:16:03,441 --> 00:16:07,340
and then he asked, he asked one of
the guys to go and bring your back.

264
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:10,820
Just the whole bag with all your
clothes, your books, everything. Yeah.

265
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:12,470
And then he you, oh,

266
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:17,800
you open that bag and then he tells you
to choose something in here to wear and

267
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:21,270
you don't choose anything else. He
says don't choose anything else. No.

268
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:22,350
That was the regulation.

269
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:25,500
The doctor is getting his first change
of clothes since he arrived in prison.

270
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:29,450
So then you showed back two years later
to choose your next tee shirt. Yes,

271
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:32,640
but then the doctor turns to the
warden. He looks him right in the eye.

272
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,320
Can I have one book? I said

273
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:40,820
even I did not expect that he will
agree to give me, so I'll just,

274
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,970
I'll just try it, you
know? And they said, yes,

275
00:16:43,971 --> 00:16:48,790
you can choose one all of your books.
So then I started thinking of the,

276
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,990
Oh, the biggest book I can
take a few minutes later.

277
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:56,030
If the doctor is walking back to his cell
with the fattest book in his bag under

278
00:16:56,031 --> 00:16:56,720
his arm,

279
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,620
you can picture him fantasizing about
just getting to lie down and read about

280
00:17:00,621 --> 00:17:01,790
when he returns to his cell.

281
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:08,180
There's that sound at the wall. It's
all clear to me the thought that,

282
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:13,070
why don't I read this before he went
to the wall and distract the negative

283
00:17:13,071 --> 00:17:13,904
thoughts.

284
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,810
Meanwhile, I'm Muhammad on his side of
the wall. Here's the new set of taps,

285
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:24,140
have a book club, a book, and
I'm ready to chapter by chapter

286
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,230
and I couldn't credit now, Huh?

287
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:33,260
Anna Karenina, the famous
novel by Leo Tolstoy,

288
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:38,380
published in 1878 the English translation
that they're using is 800 pages,

289
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:43,760
350,000 words, nearly 2
million letters, each letter,

290
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:46,880
a set of taps so the
doctor prepares himself.

291
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:50,070
So to start, I took piece of my

292
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:53,570
pitch sheet and I posted
around around my wrist,

293
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:56,280
like he's prepping for
a medical procedure,

294
00:17:56,660 --> 00:18:00,070
wrapping the sheet around his
wrist and knuckle because it will,

295
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:04,930
it will damage my reserve. I
continued like that. So then I started

296
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:07,400
okay and he started listening.

297
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:10,910
All happy families are alike.

298
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:14,930
Each unhappy family is
unhappy in its own way.

299
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:18,560
Everything was in confusion
and the upland skis house,

300
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:23,390
the wife had discovered that the
husband was carrying the effect.

301
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:28,150
The dose taps and that book had on
Mohammed's mind is after the brain.

302

320
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,321
Okay, we're back.

321
00:19:33,321 --> 00:19:38,321
This is Radiolab and we now return to
the tale told by Gregory Warner from his

322
00:19:38,511 --> 00:19:40,280
new podcast. Rough translation.

323
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:43,830
The day that the novel Anna
Karenina entered their lives,

324
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:47,880
marked a new phase for Mohammed
and the doctor. Each morning,

325
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:53,060
Dr Addin would carefully wrap his hand
and open the novel Mohammed on his side

326
00:19:53,851 --> 00:19:54,684
of the wall,

327
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:57,510
but listen, when he was stressed,

328
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,810
step on our Katovich sprinkled
some center on himself.

329
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:06,810
[inaudible] district brought the whole
story to your right pocket book matches

330
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:11,820
and watch with its double chain and
seals and shaking out his handkerchief

331
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:16,410
feeling can self-clean fragrant,
healthy and physically at ease.

332
00:20:16,411 --> 00:20:17,820
In spite of his unhappiness,

333
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:21,930
he walked with a slight swing on each
leg into the dining room where coffee was

334
00:20:21,931 --> 00:20:22,764
already.

335
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:25,680
If it's been a while since you've
cracked open on a [inaudible],

336
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:30,840
here's what you need to know. Ana is
a noble woman in 19th century Russia.

337
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,850
She's married to a man
much older than herself.

338
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:37,320
She goes to a ball and a black velvet
dress line with lace and falls in love

339
00:20:37,321 --> 00:20:40,440
with the soldier count front
skis. He's kind of a rich boy.

340
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:44,490
Careless and love Mohammed immediately
hates him is because he's also in uniform

341
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:49,240
and I was hating anything. A uniform.
Actually, this is very impersonal.

342
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:53,470
Yeah. Mean I can feel
that he's in the military.

343
00:20:53,471 --> 00:20:56,710
And you were in the military prison.
Yeah, I was a military person. Definitely.

344
00:20:57,090 --> 00:21:00,360
See you really didn't like
rod scheme. So anyway,

345
00:21:00,361 --> 00:21:03,060
the soldier of Wronski
heat seals on his heart.

346
00:21:03,061 --> 00:21:05,730
He gets her pregnant even though
she's still married to the other guy.

347
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:10,320
And then Ana makes a choice that really
changes everything because instead of

348
00:21:10,321 --> 00:21:13,650
having a secret affair, like all
the others in your social set,

349
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:17,730
she makes her love public. She
leaves her husband and society.

350
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:22,620
The Russian nobility cut her off.
They isolate her. Wronski is a man,

351
00:21:22,621 --> 00:21:26,070
so he pretty much able to go on
with his life as before, but honest,

352
00:21:26,071 --> 00:21:28,110
realizing how alone she is.

353
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:32,220
She staying in a room wondering what
Brodsky's up to when he's not with her.

354
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,273
Okay.

355
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:37,680
Just the same as Mohammed was wondering
what his wife was doing outside the

356
00:21:37,681 --> 00:21:40,860
prison walls. Muhammad reads me
this one sentence from the book,

357
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:45,270
if you love it hard. So if,

358
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:46,343
if we love it hot,

359
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:50,410
he would understand all the difficulty
of that situation and he would treat

360
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:55,230
squad from it. If he loved her, he
would rescue her from her situation.

361
00:21:55,920 --> 00:22:00,920
It's interesting because on a is traps
by reviews about women and maybe desire

362
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:07,710
and and all that, but you
are trapped by real waltz.

363
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,570
He says it didn't matter how different
their lives seemed on the outside.

364
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:17,160
Inside she was suffering all the
time. He felt exactly like Ghana.

365
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:21,990
He also was jealous, crazily jealous, and
also hating himself for being jealous.

366
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:26,940
And all of a sudden he meets this
fictional character who is suffering in

367
00:22:26,941 --> 00:22:28,350
exactly the same way.

368
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:32,970
And this suffering is driving her into
a state that Mohammad most feared for

369
00:22:32,971 --> 00:22:37,971
himself going to assist an area in my
mind when I would commit suicide without

370
00:22:38,521 --> 00:22:41,050
knowing, without wanting to.

371
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:47,100
So it's now 750 pages into the book
and two months surpass since the doctor

372
00:22:47,101 --> 00:22:49,260
first started tapping the
book letter by letter.

373
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:53,460
Ana and Bronski are now living
in Moscow and it's summer,

374
00:22:53,461 --> 00:22:56,910
so it's hot and suffocating.
And on this particular day,

375
00:22:56,911 --> 00:22:58,590
Vronsky is off visiting his mom,

376
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:02,130
which on a hates because she thinks
she's trying to set him up with a young

377
00:23:02,131 --> 00:23:06,720
princess and Ana's in the state of
mind where she both thinks that she's a

378
00:23:06,721 --> 00:23:10,200
burden to front ski and she thinks
he'd be better off without her,

379
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:15,120
but also she wants him to suffer her
absence. The way she's suffering.

380
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:20,520
It's in this state that ANA finds
herself walking down a train platform.

381
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,680
The train is hurdling down the tracks

382
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:25,910
and this thought possessor.

383
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:33,090
Fie knew what she had to do,
whether rapid lights step.

384
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:37,890
She went down the steps that led from
the tank to the rails and stopped quite

385
00:23:37,891 --> 00:23:39,180
near the approaching train.

386
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:47,180
As Mohammad is listening to this and
he's thinking about, she is about to do

387
00:23:50,090 --> 00:23:54,350
[inaudible] for her, but he realizes
his tears are not just for Ana.

388
00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:55,940
That's when I remember my wife.

389
00:23:56,330 --> 00:23:59,990
He's remembering Ismahan his
wife missy. She's suffering.

390
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,060
Yes. The books,

391
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:07,660
the one that brought me back to
think about how to Latin end,

392
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:12,000
he finds himself asking a question that
in two years in prison he has not asked

393
00:24:12,001 --> 00:24:16,320
himself before. Did I do well in
those few months we were together?

394
00:24:16,770 --> 00:24:20,640
Had he been a good husband?
Yeah. Should I treat a CBC

395
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:26,290
instead of thinking she's left him and
also hating himself for thinking that

396
00:24:26,291 --> 00:24:27,124
she's left him.

397
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:31,720
He's thinking why did he take himself
away from her by writing that stupid

398
00:24:31,721 --> 00:24:35,620
newsletter? Maybe we could have
done it in a different way.

399
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:38,050
That letter that got them all
thrown in prison. You'd be,

400
00:24:38,051 --> 00:24:41,890
you could have talked to them and putting
himself in his wife's shoes like that.

401
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:43,930
It kind of took him out of his own misery.

402
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:47,690
He could think about like
she suffered the worst,

403
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:52,780
you know than me cause I was only in
prison but she was in the outside where he

404
00:24:52,781 --> 00:24:55,600
goes from self-pity to pity for her.

405
00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:58,530
Oh I think that's related
to the book tell story.

406
00:24:58,770 --> 00:25:02,320
It's fate actually famous for that.
That's like his magic crazy talent.

407
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:04,900
Can you say more about
that magic? Crazy talent.

408
00:25:04,901 --> 00:25:08,740
Cause like when I was rereading, I
told Elif Batuman about Muhammad Story.

409
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:12,910
You've heard her reading the Tolstoy
passages for us. She's also a writer,

410
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:16,120
novelist herself and totally obsessed
with unaccredited. I like it a lot.

411
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:18,340
When I told her about
Mohammad's experience,

412
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:22,810
she had this idea about why that book
in particular might've helped Muhammad

413
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:27,430
make this mental leap from hating his
wife to imagining everything through her

414
00:25:27,431 --> 00:25:29,410
eyes tell story gives a lot of weight to,

415
00:25:29,411 --> 00:25:32,440
to all of the characters like even
suggest like a newlywed young girl.

416
00:25:32,441 --> 00:25:34,940
You spend a lot of time
and her thoughts and the,

417
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:38,380
there's like a scene where she's trying
to eat a mushroom on a plate and it

418
00:25:38,381 --> 00:25:42,220
keeps flipping from under her fork
ton. I ain't even been to spirit,

419
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:44,950
this obedient, slippery mushroom.

420
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:49,930
We had a shaking delays
through which had showed why.

421
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:55,300
It's a book that takes the subjectivity
of young women seriously and not just

422
00:25:55,301 --> 00:25:58,180
young women. Everyone that
servants and I'm the dog.

423
00:25:58,270 --> 00:26:01,690
There's a hunting scene in this that's
actually goes to the perspective of the

424
00:26:01,691 --> 00:26:04,930
dog and everything just seems so
true. You read that and you're like,

425
00:26:04,931 --> 00:26:08,140
that's definitely what that dog was
thinking and so she says the experience of

426
00:26:08,141 --> 00:26:12,370
reading Tolstoy is the experience of
being constantly confronted with how

427
00:26:12,371 --> 00:26:15,880
differently. The same thing can look
from a slightly different perspective.

428
00:26:15,881 --> 00:26:19,030
Like he's just, he never gets bored
of showing that and in the book,

429
00:26:19,031 --> 00:26:23,500
the characters themselves actually judge
each other and then are able to expand

430
00:26:23,501 --> 00:26:25,930
that and to see each other a
little bit more generously.

431
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:30,870
That's what LF thinks that Tolstoy's
book gave to Muhammad is different.

432
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:34,520
It's Kent did that. It definitely,
definitely in a place like,

433
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:39,100
like that prison people
become very selfish.

434
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:43,290
You think everybody has forgotten about
me at the beginning for concern about

435
00:26:43,291 --> 00:26:44,124
me, so

436
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:46,050
I nobody cares about me like that.

437
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:51,390
But when you think about other people's
situation, then you, you understand.

438
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:55,260
It helped me survive. It's
helping me even sleep better.

439
00:26:56,140 --> 00:27:00,130
Tolstoy actually had one more
role to play in Mohammed's life.

440
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:01,930
Eight years after his arrest,

441
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:06,400
the Somali political winds had shifted
and the dictator was trying to appease

442
00:27:06,401 --> 00:27:09,370
his enemies. Mohammad and the
others were suddenly released.

443
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:13,090
He discovered his region of
Somalia was flattened by civil war,

444
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:17,410
but Muhammad also discovered
something else. His wife is mine.

445
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:18,910
She was still his wife.

446
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:23,980
She had not given up on him and she had
suffered in his absence working at the

447
00:27:23,981 --> 00:27:24,814
state bank.

448
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:29,880
She'd been pressured by your boss to
divorce the trader Mohammed when she

449
00:27:30,371 --> 00:27:33,970
refused. She was relocated and by
the time Mohammed was released,

450
00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:36,700
she was living in a
refugee camp in Germany.

451
00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:39,280
She couldn't even make it
back to Somalia to see him.

452
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:42,070
So I wait to another, uh,

453
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:47,120
that was for another say about 10
months, I think, to, to see each other.

454
00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:48,320
Finally,

455
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:53,060
they figured out a way
that they can reunite in a
neighboring country and though

456
00:27:53,061 --> 00:27:55,850
it's been almost a decade
since they've seen each other,

457
00:27:56,900 --> 00:28:00,530
you recognized her immediately from a
distance and it's, they drew closer.

458
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:05,870
Ismahan opens her arms to give her
husband a hug and he reaches out.

459
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:11,060
And all that he could do in
that moment is shake her hand.

460
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:16,153
Yeah.

461
00:28:17,610 --> 00:28:20,430
Why do I not feel as I
felt even even in prison,

462
00:28:20,431 --> 00:28:24,060
I was feeling so much in love
with that. And yet when we met,

463
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:28,190
it wasn't the same. She was like a

464
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:34,970
stranger or something like that.
Wow. I mean, I was asking myself,

465
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:38,990
why are you not as in
love with heart as before

466
00:28:42,370 --> 00:28:42,850
[inaudible]

467
00:28:42,850 --> 00:28:47,220
and is, this was a moment that we
found really interesting and uh,

468
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:51,810
you know, as we were talking about it
with Greg, oh no, no, no. It was a studio.

469
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:55,560
Greg said that it was really in
this moment, this period of doubt,

470
00:28:55,590 --> 00:29:00,210
he was overcome by a momentary doubt of
the possibility of setting up that new

471
00:29:00,211 --> 00:29:04,620
life you dreamed of on the way that
the book came back to Muhammad again.

472
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:07,530
Except this time he didn't think of
the main character Anna Karenina.

473
00:29:07,531 --> 00:29:11,050
He thought of a different character in
the book. A guy by the name of Levon.

474
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:15,300
This is a character who
is, uh, also in love,

475
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:17,610
also has like strong emotions.

476
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:22,620
And like Muhammad in that one moment
with his wife love and spends the entire

477
00:29:22,621 --> 00:29:26,800
book just racked by doubts,
doubts about everything,

478
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,050
an eternal dissatisfaction with yourself,

479
00:29:29,650 --> 00:29:33,640
vain attempts to improve and failures
and then internal expectation of the

480
00:29:33,641 --> 00:29:35,770
happiness and standing
there with his wife,

481
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:40,750
not just weirded out by his own lack of
feeling. Mohammad had two thoughts like,

482
00:29:40,810 --> 00:29:41,643
oh,

483
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:46,600
I'm like living in this moment and
what happens to live in at the end?

484
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:49,690
And what's really cool about Levin's
conclusion at the end of the book is he

485
00:29:49,691 --> 00:29:50,950
finally just decides like,

486
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:53,500
I'm not going to worry about
how weird my feelings are.

487
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:56,290
Like he doesn't actually come,

488
00:29:56,350 --> 00:30:00,520
he doesn't make himself whole as he
wants to be. He wants to the whole book.

489
00:30:00,521 --> 00:30:05,440
He wants to be, um, fully in love with
Kitty and not just with his heart,

490
00:30:05,441 --> 00:30:06,880
but with his mind and his soul.

491
00:30:06,881 --> 00:30:10,030
And he wants to be a good Christian and
everything has to sort of make sense to

492
00:30:10,031 --> 00:30:11,620
him, but you know,

493
00:30:11,621 --> 00:30:16,600
but he's just a complicated sort of guy
and he's got many different feelings.

494
00:30:16,601 --> 00:30:19,420
But at the end of the book he
kind of feels like, you know,

495
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:24,780
I'm going to stop just thinking obsessive
Lee about how awkward I am in this

496
00:30:25,751 --> 00:30:30,640
situation and I'm just going to do and
I'm supposed to, I'm going to be the dad,

497
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:31,920
I'm gonna be the husband

498
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:34,050
and Mohammed thought to himself, uh,

499
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:38,360
like maybe I need to do that too because
like who knows where I'm at right now.

500
00:30:38,361 --> 00:30:43,361
I was in a cell for eight years in the
prison in a way you hadn't to living,

501
00:30:44,330 --> 00:30:46,980
you are still inside
yourself. You had not,

502
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:52,180
you have to open any figured like opening
back up is probably going to take some

503
00:30:52,641 --> 00:30:53,474
time

504
00:30:54,490 --> 00:30:59,490
and some work we have to learn to love
each other again and that he says is what

505
00:30:59,851 --> 00:31:00,620
they did.

506
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:02,480
Hey told us. That had a lot to do with it.

507
00:31:03,890 --> 00:31:07,220
You think Tolstoy helps you fall
in love again? Yeah, I mean,

508
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:10,400
I mean feeling of, look, you know,

509
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:15,290
it wasn't so easy to become a love again.

510
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:19,670
This man has been experienced as
she was leaving [inaudible] life.

511
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:22,180
It's difficult for people to grow the,

512
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:25,910
to live with someone who has been
in solitary confinement for so long.

513
00:31:26,330 --> 00:31:28,880
I was probably very difficult to
live with at that particular time.

514
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:35,120
And you're saying that knowing that you
are hard to live with, knowing yes. Yes.

515
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:39,630
It's made it easier for us to
talk to each other, to live,

516
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:44,190
to learn to live with each other. Because
you knew that yes, your heart was not.

517
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:46,530
Yes, yes. Quite working yet. Yeah.

518
00:31:52,370 --> 00:31:53,203
[inaudible]

519
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:56,330
[inaudible] I shouldn't be
the monument for that book.

520
00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:06,590
Hey, one last thing. There is
someone else to give credit to here.

521
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:08,840
Besides the great Russian author,

522
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,840
every detail the Tolstoy
wrote into that book,

523
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:15,680
every perspective shift that helped
Mohammad escape his prison cell.

524
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:20,740
All of a sudden it has had to be tapped
out on a concrete wall by a friend.

525
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:21,020
No,

526
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:26,020
I could imagine him getting tired
because he was at work and God at ain't

527
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:27,133
working out.

528
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:31,610
Dr Addons said that Mohammed was his
last patient after their release.

529
00:32:31,611 --> 00:32:35,120
He was just too out of practice to
return to medicine and after prison,

530
00:32:35,121 --> 00:32:39,680
the doctor did try to read the novel
on a Corena. Again, I went a bull show,

531
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:43,880
but when I tried to read the, couldn't
read it too many bad memories,

532
00:32:44,390 --> 00:32:46,730
but he knew someone who
could use it. Somebody,

533
00:32:46,731 --> 00:32:50,420
a friend who was in prison here in
Samala, the journalist, a friend,

534
00:32:50,990 --> 00:32:55,990
and I took that book to him and
I told him that's the best thing,

535
00:32:56,270 --> 00:32:58,670
Mr President you can have
in a prison is a book.

536
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:01,793

537
