00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.890
A genetic genealogist uses DNA testing in conjunction with traditional

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.250
genealogy research, in order to learn more about our roots.

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.720
&gt;&gt; That's really amazing. you know, we have an individual,

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:18.010
in our course named Sterling, who is actually submitted his DNA

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:21.900
sample to 23andMe, and gotten results back, and he has been

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.200
able to find a, as close a match as a second

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:30.100
cousin on the relative finder. Now, if you were chatting with him, and

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:33.220
he was looking for a next step, what advice would you give to

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:36.740
him, to sort of deal with trying to reach out to that person

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:39.310
or possibly, you know, finding other connections

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:40.970
that he could get more information from?

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:44.790
&gt;&gt; There's a couple different things he should do. First of all, he may want

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:46.270
to join one of our adoption DNA

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:51.060
mailing lists. We have extremely helpful search angels

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:55.090
on those lists, who started out as traditional adoption search angels.

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:56.900
So, they know how to work with the records, and if

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:01.030
he has any non-identifying information, that can really help to use

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.569
that in conjunction with his DNA results. So, we can help to

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:07.720
teach him on those lists, what he needs to do next.

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.450
And sometimes, you know, do more than just teach him, but

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.470
hand hold, and if he gets real close to the answer,

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.080
one of the search angels will jump in and help. And when

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.290
I say real close, a second cousin is

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.670
really close. So, he probably could find someone

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.322
who'd be willing to help him work through

00:01:24.322 --> 00:01:27.604
these matches, and try to identify his birth parents.

00:01:27.604 --> 00:01:31.735
&gt;&gt; You actually run a very popular blog called your Genetic

00:01:31.735 --> 00:01:35.049
Genealogist. And I'd love for you to tell us a little bit

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:38.388
more about, how you, you started that blog, and what it means

00:01:38.388 --> 00:01:41.109
to you, and what people use it for today. I guess that

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:45.168
means that I have to start at the beginning a little bit. Which is that, I was a

00:01:45.168 --> 00:01:51.166
genealogist, just hobbiest, and I've always loved genetics. It's

00:01:51.166 --> 00:01:53.201
not my career in the past, I wasn't trained

00:01:53.201 --> 00:01:55.126
in it, but I've always been drawn to it,

00:01:55.126 --> 00:01:58.185
and always really loved it. And so when autosomal

00:01:58.185 --> 00:02:03.613
DNA was introduced for genealogical purposes, by 23andME, I

00:02:03.613 --> 00:02:07.549
jumped in with both feet. I was so excited.

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:10.453
it was actually Catherine Borges who is the director

00:02:10.453 --> 00:02:13.225
of ISOGG who first showed me what they were doing,

00:02:13.225 --> 00:02:15.205
and I just fell madly in love, and it

00:02:15.205 --> 00:02:18.390
completely took over my life. So it went from being

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.740
a hobby, to a full-time volunteer position, and now

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.750
a career. And part of that was starting my blog.

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.970
I was answering a lot of questions all the time,

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.990
of people who needed help, right away. And so I

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:35.290
wanted a way to be able to answer those questions,

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.860
and not have to keep repeating the same answers over

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.010
and over. I was also doing some really fascinating research

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.380
with my own family, and wanted to have a place

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:48.290
to write that up. And, I was corresponding with 23andMe

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.120
a lot, people who worked over there. Right away I

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.160
established a good relationship with them. And it was actually

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.710
one of them who recommended that I start a blog.

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:00.900
It was Alex from 23andMe. He's not there

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.730
anymore, but he was one of the early employees

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:04.840
there, and he said, you know, you should

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.710
write a blog. And so, I'd never done anything

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:12.490
like that, and I enjoyed it right off the bat. It was so fun to share my

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:16.470
research and get input from everybody, and help people

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.070
learn what to do with their results as well.

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:21.230
&gt;&gt; Well you know, we're really intrigued that

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.890
you say, you know, genetics is a passion

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:26.540
of yours, but it wasn't actually what you studied. Can

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.730
you tell us a bit more, about what you did

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.745
before you got into this, and sort of what your

00:03:30.745 --> 00:03:35.470
segue was? Were you just super, super-nerd, spend all your

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:39.050
free time in genetics, or was this just a, a

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:42.260
really fun hobby for you? Genetics was always something that

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.970
I was interested in, but I had not studied it.

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.810
In fact, I was a music and theater major in college,

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.540
and I have fallen in love with genetics just prior

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.610
to that, in my senior year in high school when I

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:58.100
was in AP Bio. We had a little genetics section as

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:01.860
part of our course work, and I absolutely loved it. So,

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:04.210
I should have taken the clue then, and I, I

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:06.610
loved it enough that I did think about changing my major,

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:09.400
and I even investigated it. But I already had a scholarship

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.870
for music at USC, and they didn't have a genetics undergraduate

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:16.029
program, or I very well may have done it.

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:18.329
But, I just stuck with my original plan. And,

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:21.500
many years later, here I end up back again

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:26.390
loving genetics, but this time it took over my life.

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:30.180
So, I had started as a genealogist, in 2002

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.960
I think was when I really got involved, and I

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.290
was looking at making a family tree for my

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:39.250
niece's wedding. And I, the type of person who jumps

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:41.670
in with both feet, and I did that, and

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:45.170
got kind of obsessed. And did geology for a few

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:48.490
years, before I got really interested in the genetics part

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:52.340
of it. we were just using Y DNA and MT

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:54.630
DNA at the time, which I still thought was interesting,

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:57.640
but I wasn't quite as fascinated as I am with

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:01.220
autosomal DNA, and that's really become my focus. Although I

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:04.550
use the other type in conjunction with it many times,

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:08.230
especially in adoption searches. So, how did I

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:09.610
get into it? So, I started writing a

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:13.270
blog, and I got so many questions from

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:16.570
people, and so much interest, that it's literally started

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:22.030
taking over my life. I had tons of comments on the blog, I had tons of

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:26.750
private emails of people wanting help. Particularly, people

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:30.210
who were searching for close family members, like adoptees.

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:33.800
And people who had discovered close family members, and hadn't

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:37.160
expected it. there's so many people out there that this

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:40.290
is happening to, you would be surprised. And I sometimes

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:43.920
wonder if there's much more of that, in our society than

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:47.240
we realize. But then I think it's also possible, that

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:49.790
the people who are drawn to testing are the people

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:52.110
who maybe felt a little different, or felt like something

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:56.680
was missing in their lives. So to go from entertainment, and

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:59.200
then end up in a science career, in my

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:01.530
forties, is definitely not something I would have ever

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:05.470
imagined, but it is so fascinating. Everyday I wake

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:07.760
up in the morning, and I immediately want to

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:09.800
jump out of bed and run down to my

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:14.370
computer, and see what new fascinating things have transpired

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:18.420
overnight. And believe me, there's always something. There's such

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:21.880
a huge demand for this. And maybe a year

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:25.730
ago, some people had come to me and asked me, you know, if they wanted to have a

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:29.405
career in genetic genealogy, was there was there a

00:06:29.405 --> 00:06:32.726
demand for it? And it's changed. Really then, maybe a

00:06:32.726 --> 00:06:35.903
year ago, two years ago, there wasn't much of

00:06:35.903 --> 00:06:39.070
a demand for it. And in the last year or

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:43.720
two, it has literally exploded. So now, I absolutely

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:48.270
would say that there is room for genetic genealogy consultants

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:52.480
people who are willing to learn what we're doing, and

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:55.000
if they have a background in genealogy that would be

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.670
great. And if they don't that's fine too, they'll have

00:06:57.670 --> 00:06:59.780
to learn both sides of it. So they'll have to learn

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:02.980
the DNA part, and the genealogy part. But if they're

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:06.010
adventurous, and they're looking for a new career, and they love

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:09.180
detective work, because that's exactly what this is, then I

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:11.940
would strongly recommend that they look into this as a career.

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:13.360
&gt;&gt; in, in, in the

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:16.220
same vein, is there any other specific advice, or resources

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:19.230
you would give to someone who's particularly moved by this

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:22.280
subject, and wants to investigate about the possibility of studying

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:24.985
more? Are there some places they can go to sort of

00:07:24.985 --> 00:07:25.950
[COUGH]

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:28.860
learn more about how to become a genetic genealogist that you recommend?

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:31.930
&gt;&gt; Yes. Because the field is so fast

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:34.780
moving, there are very few books that really address

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:37.820
the subject. And everyday we have someone asking, you

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:40.940
know, is there a genetic genealogy for dummies book.

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:42.950
And there isn't, not yet at least. And

00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:45.180
that's because those of us who've tried to write

00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:47.890
them, find that they are so quickly outdated, that

00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:51.540
trying to get something published is very difficult that's

00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:54.060
up to date. So, we always recommend that you

00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:58.110
read the blogs, you read my blog, Blaine's blog,

00:07:58.110 --> 00:08:01.150
Roberta Estes blog, there's some other really good ones

00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:04.190
out there. Kitty Cooper has recently started writing some

00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:08.630
fantastic resources. And most of all join our mailing

00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:11.840
list, because that's where you really get help from

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:13.950
the experts. And the people who've been doing this

00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:16.610
from the very beginning, are very generous with their

00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:19.026
time, and they're on those lists. So join the

00:08:19.026 --> 00:08:24.132
International Society of Genetic Genealogy, it's free. It's ISOGG,

00:08:24.132 --> 00:08:28.240
isogg.org, and then you'll get an invitation to join

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:32.080
the DNA newbie list, which I happen to administer

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:34.110
and, you can go there and ask the most

00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:37.350
basic questions. and we have people who have been

00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:38.780
on the list for quite a while, so we

00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:41.970
also have more intermediate discussions, and sometimes even venture

00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:44.650
into more advanced. So just keep reading

00:08:44.650 --> 00:08:46.850
everything you can, that's how I learned this.

00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:50.940
&gt;&gt; Great, CeCe it's been a pleasure chatting with you. I hope

00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:54.570
you'll join us again, maybe in the discussion forums for our course.

00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:57.070
&gt;&gt; That would be great I'd love to.
