00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:04.400
When you're starting your company,
you have a tiny stash of cash.

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.810
You might be finding it yourself or
raising it from friends and

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:12.450
family or if you're lucky,
even a seed loan from an investor.

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.480
&gt;&gt; Your major goal is to build a
sustainable company out of this capital,

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.640
whatever it may be.

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.360
And in a lot of cases,
you might think that your product is so

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.840
amazing that'll just sell itself.

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.350
But unfortunately, this is actually
a very long and challenging road.

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:31.880
You need to promote your product,
acquire users, and then charge money.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.670
&gt;&gt; Very true, let's hear from some of
the thought leaders on that subject
