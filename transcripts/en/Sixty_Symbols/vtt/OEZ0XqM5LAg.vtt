00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.680
In a perfect world if this were a rubber ball,

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:07.680
and I dropped it down to the floor, it would bounce up to the same height, if it was completely elastic.

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.020
But it would go, in practice, to a lower height, and then a lower height, and then a lower height...

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:21.820
This object apparently is called a dropper popper.

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:27.620
It has a little rod at the top and it has some rubber that comes down this way,

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:29.760
only you can bend it the other way.

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.272
And it has two states which are quite stable: that state

00:00:34.272 --> 00:00:35.480
and that state.

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.440
And what I'm going to do is put it into this state,

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.960
and drop it on the floor,

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.260
giving it a spin so that it remains in the horizontal plane.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.400
And if I do this and drop it... are you filming it now Brady?

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.040
...it bounces up. And I can catch it -- even an old man like me.

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:55.880
And if I drop it from this height...

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.800
...it goes up higher than the height from which it was dropped.

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.420
This, at first, made me addicted to it because I couldn't work out...

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.880
...why it was doing this, because it seemed extremely strange

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:27.760
that you would be able to drop this... and catch it and it goes up higher than before.

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.280
And I also learned that I could do it with both hands.

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.380
And I've been trying to do it with both hands and catch it, but it's impossible.

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:39.040
[Brady] Orr, almost!

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:40.260
[Professor Bowley] On the rebound!

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:46.020
When it's at this height we say it has energy because I've done work lifting it up to this height.

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.240
So there is an energy due to its position,

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.600
and if I drop it on the floor, if it bounced elastically it would come up to the same height.

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.400
The thing which is surprising is that it goes further.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:03.800
What happens is you deform this... you have to really push hard on this to get it to go into that state...

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.140
It requires quite a bit of work to get it into that state,

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.880
and it always... if I tip it back... it will go back automatically into that state.

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:17.460
So you started off in this state, which has cost you a bit of work because you have to force yourself to do it...

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:20.100
Now, when it drops down, and it hits the floor,

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.940
it can go into the other state, if it whacks down hard enough.

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.180
So if I were to do this from a very low height, nothing happens.

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:30.360
If I drop it from this height...

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.480
...then it bounces much higher.

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.540
When it lands it hits the floor,

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:43.672
suddenly, the central pillar comes out, hits the floor, and pushes up,

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.520
and it jumps in the air.

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.920
This is releasing energy because this state requires you to do work...

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.620
that state has a lower energy -- lower potential energy -- and that energy is released

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.580
by pushing on the floor and raising up higher.

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.780
To change it to the other configuration I had to pull on this rubber

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.900
and extend the molecules of the rubber and do work on it.

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.000
And if I do that and get it to a certain point it will click over.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.840
And now I've stretched these rubber molecules a little bit,

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.220
it's much more taut -- you can feel that it doesn't move so much.

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.160
When it hits the ground, the top of this dome...

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.040
suddenly gets inverted and becomes a dome pointing the other way,

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:32.320
and that pushes this rod down, and then it hits the floor and bounces up.

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.580
When you have any object like this and you spin it

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:47.040
the angular momentum of the spin remains constant and keeps the axis about which it rotates vertical.

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.100
And that's what I'm trying to do. [Brady] Like a top? [Professor Bowley] Like a spinning top,

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:55.920
so that when it hits the floor I'm hoping that I haven't twisted it sideways by any little bit,

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:00.020
and therefore when it falls down it's likely to release the maximum amount of energy

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:06.140
because it's hitting and somehow on all faces at the same time and coming up.

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:09.180
If I had it coming down a hitting on the side...

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.060
well, you can see that can still work, but it just flew out of my hand in one way.
