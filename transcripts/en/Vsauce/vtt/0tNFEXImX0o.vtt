Hey, Vsauce. Michael here, next to a giant bird,

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:07.779
which can only mean one thing.
I'm in London, where even the pillows

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:12.039
say "God save the Queen." It's a cushion, Michael.
Alright, look.

00:00:12.039 --> 00:00:15.239
I've got a bird trying to tell me what to say.
That's right, in England

00:00:15.239 --> 00:00:18.370
this is a bird and this is a bird.

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:21.370
Of course, I call her Hazel.
But I've got a piece of knowledge for you,

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:25.000
Hazel. It's a new word and the word is DONG.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.540
DONG.
Is that

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:33.900
something you eat?
No. It's things you do online now guys.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.079
Iambebeast recommended Musicovery,

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.089
an awesome site with a mood pad.
Mouse over the pad to choose you current or

00:00:41.089 --> 00:00:42.210
desired mood

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.269
and it immediately changes.
You can even focus it on a decade or genre

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:49.769
within your mood. But if you want
complete control, upload your own favorite

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:51.079
song to Pixel White,

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:55.019
like you Ulication. The game lasts as
long as the song you upload

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:58.479
and the songs' equalizer bars become the
plane space.

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.760
Dizquier91 brought up a list of sites,

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:05.420
where you can waste time like a professional.
While I was there,

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.860
I found Nooooooooooooooo.com.

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:10.600
When something terrible happens,

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.600
go there and push the button.

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:21.300
I also discovered ooooiiii.com.

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.710
The title makes more sense after you go
there. But if you want TheCasalex's

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.090
computerception,

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.240
play a game where you're on a computer.

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.470
Or Coachhere recommends a game with state of the art

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.979
ASCII graphics. You're a Rafflecopter
dropping WTF bombs

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.070
on guys wearing roller skates.
Too fancy?

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.550
Well, play this even simpler game programmed to
happen inside your URL bar.

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:48.830
Use the arrow keys to move the "O" to
lasso A's

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.170
and press the spacebar to kill as many
as possible in 30 seconds.

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.619
PointlessSites is another good
collection of places. While I was there

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.420
I found one billion mazes, a site that literally

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.149
has 1,000,000,000 mazes. If you solved
one maze every single second,

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.149
it would take you more than 31 years to
finish them all.

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.540
Speaking of long times, here's a YouTube
video of a guy counting to 100

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.750
thousand and yeah, that says 74 hours.

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.550
41, 42, 43.

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.800
44, 45.

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.400
But to feel really sad, play Platform

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.739
and learn a life lesson.
Videos, do you want more?

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:33.980
Well, this one is a really sweet playlist
containing the first

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.150
hour of MTV as it originally aired with

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.510
the original commercials. And lately I've
been working with Greg from Dr. Coolsex

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:43.880
and getting into his WTF series.
Each week

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.350
we learn a little bit more about what
happened or what's happen...

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.180
...ing. You be the judge. And if you're in
London, I hope to see you at Summer in the

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.120
City tomorrow.

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.080
And as always,

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.400
thanks for watching.
