00:00:16.104 --> 00:00:19.720
INTERVIEWER: The poet Roland
Barthes talks about the amorous

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.290
embrace as this
post-coital cuddling,

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:26.120
this intersubjective
ecstasy that you enter

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:27.890
with your romantic partner.

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.640
And that is beyond sexuality.

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.010
That is beyond
physical attraction.

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.770
That space of shared
soul-smearing.

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:41.100
Sort of sexually enabled,
technologically mediated,

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.730
Buddhist space where
two become one.

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.630
I keep bringing back term
intersubjective, ecstasy.

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:48.060
Why do we love to cuddle?

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.240
Why do we love to give each
other baby names and treat

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.110
each other like
we're little children

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:56.560
and create kind of womb-like
spaces of comfort and divinity

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.730
for one another where we can
be as gods outside of time,

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:03.900
temporarily stepping off
that people mover that's

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:08.310
carrying everyone else towards
death, as Alan Harrington says?

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.510
We're trying to find
escapes from the despair.

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.450
Together we are creating
a shared universe

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.826
where we can float above
the clouds of entropy.

00:01:18.826 --> 00:01:22.172
Where we cannot die.

00:01:22.172 --> 00:01:23.370
That is what love is about.

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:27.190
It's about saving
ourselves from mortality.

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:30.640
We are the gods with anuses,
as Ernest Becker says.

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.550
And we do everything we can to
deny our own creaturely-ness,

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:38.540
to deny our own decay,
to deny all you despair.

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.130
Can you blame us for squeezing
so tightly around one another?

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.380
Can you blame us for wanting
to listen to beautiful music

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:46.880
and cry together?

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.200
Can you blame us for
wanting to seek out

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.300
comfort in each other's
cold soul space and to say,

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.850
please tell me you
will not leave me,

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:56.840
you will not disappear.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.680
I will not be alone.

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.050
I'm not going to drown.

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.240
Just like, ah.

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.150
That's what we want.

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:04.654
That's what we seek.

00:02:04.654 --> 00:02:06.195
And they say, oh,
we're co-dependent.

00:02:06.195 --> 00:02:07.020
We're weak.

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.382
We should be independent.

00:02:09.382 --> 00:02:10.090
But come on, man.

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.840
It's what all the psychedelic
explorers have told us.

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.036
It's eco-delic.

00:02:14.036 --> 00:02:15.036
It's all interconnected.

00:02:15.036 --> 00:02:17.250
We are all one.

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:18.140
We're not alone.

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.825
It's OK to be co-dependent.

00:02:21.825 --> 00:02:22.700
It's not a bad thing.
