00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:06.150
In today's video we are taking a look at a popular and easy to do illusion and seeing just how far we can push it

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:21.419
Guys a few years ago action lab did an amazing video where he showed you how to draw on water now

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.310
That's a pretty cool experiment now

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.590
I have seen a lot of different youtubers who have done this

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.239
But I've never seen anybody try and stack their art together to form sort of an illusion

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.619
I want to try that

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.418
I want to try different types of dry erase markers to see if they have any sort of difference and see if we can actually

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.160
Get a barrier to for them with a pane of glass and just some hot glue sticks. Here's the basic idea

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.019
We have several different types of dry erase markers and several panes of glass now

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:49.139
We should be able to get our drawings to float on the surface of water

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:55.229
so by adding a waterproof barrier to our piece of glass we should be able to stack them up and see if we can get

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.660
An illusion to form. This should be pretty simple

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.009
We've got just a few panes of glass here and we're gonna try and form a waterproofing barrier

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.899
Just using some hot glue sticks. It should be pretty simple. The reason I'm not using any sort of just

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:13.050
Pre-made dish like Pyrex is when you have a cooking pyrex dish if you've ever seen these other videos before

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:15.329
They tend to have a sort of a warped bottom now

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:21.539
My goal here is to try and get lots of overlay pieces of art the way to do that is have a perfectly smooth surface

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:24.330
So I'm gonna have to build these myself

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.399
This is not the most conventional method of using hot glue sticks

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:33.489
But you guys have seen me do weird stuff with them before so why not?

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.460
The reason these are gonna be so nice is they're kind of rubbery

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.909
So when we stack the panes of glass they shouldn't split. We'll see

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:06.059
Now the reason that using glass is so important when you're trying to draw on water is

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:11.190
It's a non-porous surface and you need something. That is very very smooth anything. That's

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:16.379
Textured means that the dry erase marker is going to sort of sink into it and it's not going to release as you'd be even

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.969
With the release agent that's in these markers. So I want this very very smooth glass

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.419
But what that means is the hot glue is less likely to stick

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.060
Let's see if it's watertight

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:37.879
So far so good

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:49.100
All right, so we've got our glass panes and they're more or less waterproof so those are pretty much good to go

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.489
But before we start drawing on those, I wouldn't do a few tests

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:59.779
Now action lab said that he had the best results with glass bowls or anything that has a very smooth non-porous surface

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:05.089
But also with using hot water so we're gonna try a few different types. I've got a few different types of markers

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.450
I've got Expo markers, which is what most everyone seems to use

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.079
But we've also got a few off-brand markers and I want to see if there's a difference

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.089
We've also got three different temperatures of water

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:19.700
I've just got cold tap water just sort of a lukewarm and then one that we actually microwave to get really really hot

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.839
So I want to see what that's gonna do first test. Just our black Expo marker

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.000
we're gonna try it with cold water lukewarm and then hot

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:34.880
Keep this very simple what we just do some tests or some cold water. And so I'm gonna go ahead and say that did

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:42.020
Nothing, the ink is still very much a dear to the bottom of the glass. It's not even wanting to pull up

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:44.450
All right. Let's try the lukewarm water

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.599
All right, same thing not much happening there

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:01.399
I'll also be curious to see if the off-brand markers or if a different color works any better

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.530
Well, that was different

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.759
So with the hot water immediately you're starting to see it crack

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:14.060
Again, not floating to the surface

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:19.969
Alright action lab used blue Expo in his first video. He's done a few of these there's one

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:23.989
He actually does a magnetic animation with them with a magnetic putty

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:30.320
When I could forget in that crazy today, but he did manage to make a blue Expo marker work fast. Let's try it

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:35.450
We were seeming to have the most success with the hottest water. So we'll go ahead and do that

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:42.990
But definitely parts of it came to the surface

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:59.199
That's definitely thinking about it it's not keeping the shape we wanted. All right, so a little float to the surface

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:04.239
Not keep me in shape. Let's try that one one more time. Whew is definitely working better?

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:14.330
Alright so this bottom might just be too hot

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:18.379
I'm not pouring it gently enough because it's just falling to pieces, but it is floating to the surface

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:25.039
Let's go ahead and try one of our off-brand see if that works any better and be shocked if it does

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:27.039
But it's got a try

00:05:27.629 --> 00:05:35.329
It actually released much better. However, it did fall apart. Now. It's almost looking like this is dissolving in the really really hot water

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:41.000
So I do think we need that mix between hot and lukewarm. So I'm gonna mix those. We're gonna try again

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:47.959
There's definitely a temperature factor here and that's pretty cool. So we've got off-brand Expo Expo Expo

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:51.440
Off-brand and then three of our tinier Expo markers

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:58.669
Just cooling down the hot water just a little so it's warm to the touch it's not going to burn me

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:04.030
There we go

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:10.269
All right. Let's see here. What's working best blue green, so that's interesting. The orange pigment was surprising

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:14.650
I didn't think that would work. We've also got our red Expo month of floating to the surface. That's good to know

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:21.129
It is interesting to note though that the green and the blue are just sort of dissolving pink orange is working better than the rest

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:39.489
Well almost all right, let's go ahead and try on one of our flat surfaces see if we can get any better results

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:04.839
He's waving at us and he broke

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:19.740
Well almost

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:22.740
Purple is holding together a little bit better

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:26.460
Also not wanting to rise to the surface

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:32.190
However, the blue even though it is sort of dissolving as it goes

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:37.019
It's forming some really fun patterns. So we might try that instead

00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:40.049
Let's just try and see if we get some fun patterns on the surface of the water

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:40.920
All right

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:46.140
so success rate is varying wildly depending on the marker that we're using the heat of the water and

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:50.459
Smaller drawings or drawings with more ink tend to be working a little bit better

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:53.190
So I'm going to attempt that and then we're gonna attempt to stack this

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:12.379
All right, see if this works guys

00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:26.990
Some of it is definitely lifting off better than others

00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:47.290
Well, that's interesting just because you can see that some of the colors lifted off and some did not

00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:49.870
You've got one mobile design here

00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:53.829
Which is at this point just a very large stringing mist

00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:25.090
That's cool so you can layer and switch it up see then get these two back together ha ha ha

00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:29.949
That's fun. You can kind of manipulate it to go back to where it's supposed to be

00:09:30.650 --> 00:09:36.249
We go the other one underneath it. You could do some fun optical illusions with this. Can you draw on water?

00:09:36.250 --> 00:09:40.539
And can you layer it for optical illusions? Yeah, you can is it practical?

00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:43.090
Probably not but it's a lot of fun

00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:47.110
We go

00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:51.609
