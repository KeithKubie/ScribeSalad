one of the questions we asked when GHSA
 

00:52:22.090 --> 00:52:23.970
one of the questions we asked when GHSA
was launched and it's a place where

was launched and it's a place where
 

00:52:23.980 --> 00:52:25.800
was launched and it's a place where
progress has been made but a lot more

external evaluations and on the right

00:52:34.470 --> 00:52:34.480
external evaluations and on the right
 

00:52:34.480 --> 00:52:36.270
external evaluations and on the right
side of the slide it's just an example

00:52:36.270 --> 00:52:36.280
side of the slide it's just an example
 

00:52:36.280 --> 00:52:38.910
side of the slide it's just an example
of what one of the evaluations results

00:52:38.910 --> 00:52:38.920
of what one of the evaluations results
 

00:52:38.920 --> 00:52:40.950
of what one of the evaluations results
actually looks like and I highlight this

00:52:40.950 --> 00:52:40.960
actually looks like and I highlight this
 

00:52:40.960 --> 00:52:42.960
actually looks like and I highlight this
example because it's what most countries

00:52:42.960 --> 00:52:42.970
example because it's what most countries
 

00:52:42.970 --> 00:52:45.150
example because it's what most countries
look like there's a lot of yellow a

00:52:45.150 --> 00:52:45.160
look like there's a lot of yellow a
 

00:52:45.160 --> 00:52:48.000
look like there's a lot of yellow a
little bit of green and some red and the

00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:48.010
little bit of green and some red and the
 

00:52:48.010 --> 00:52:50.610
little bit of green and some red and the
goal here is to turn all of that red and

00:52:50.610 --> 00:52:50.620
goal here is to turn all of that red and
 

00:52:50.620 --> 00:52:53.100
goal here is to turn all of that red and
yellow into green and to keep it green

00:52:53.100 --> 00:52:53.110
yellow into green and to keep it green
 

00:52:53.110 --> 00:52:55.170
yellow into green and to keep it green
and we can't do that unless we're

00:52:55.170 --> 00:52:55.180
and we can't do that unless we're
 

00:52:55.180 --> 00:52:56.910
and we can't do that unless we're
actually actively evaluating and

00:52:56.910 --> 00:52:56.920
actually actively evaluating and
 

00:52:56.920 --> 00:53:00.600
actually actively evaluating and

the last thing that I'll say quickly is

00:53:02.370 --> 00:53:02.380
the last thing that I'll say quickly is
 

00:53:02.380 --> 00:53:03.990
the last thing that I'll say quickly is
I'll just highlight three challenges in

00:53:03.990 --> 00:53:04.000
I'll just highlight three challenges in
 

00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:05.850
I'll just highlight three challenges in
global health security that I think the

00:53:05.850 --> 00:53:05.860
global health security that I think the
 

00:53:05.860 --> 00:53:07.650
global health security that I think the
global health security agenda is focused

00:53:07.650 --> 00:53:07.660
global health security agenda is focused
 

00:53:07.660 --> 00:53:10.290
global health security agenda is focused
on but I know that also w-h-o is focused

00:53:10.290 --> 00:53:10.300
on but I know that also w-h-o is focused
 

00:53:10.300 --> 00:53:13.110
on but I know that also w-h-o is focused
on as well one is leveraging the

00:53:13.110 --> 00:53:13.120
on as well one is leveraging the
 

00:53:13.120 --> 00:53:15.030
on as well one is leveraging the
commitments that are out there so

00:53:15.030 --> 00:53:15.040
commitments that are out there so
 

00:53:15.040 --> 00:53:17.610
commitments that are out there so
through the last couple of g7 and g20

00:53:17.610 --> 00:53:17.620
through the last couple of g7 and g20
 

00:53:17.620 --> 00:53:20.280
through the last couple of g7 and g20
cycles many high-level commitments have

00:53:20.280 --> 00:53:20.290
cycles many high-level commitments have
 

00:53:20.290 --> 00:53:22.320
cycles many high-level commitments have
been made this is just one example that

00:53:22.320 --> 00:53:22.330
been made this is just one example that
 

00:53:22.330 --> 00:53:24.720
been made this is just one example that
the g7 has made a commitment to assist

00:53:24.720 --> 00:53:24.730
the g7 has made a commitment to assist
 

00:53:24.730 --> 00:53:27.360
the g7 has made a commitment to assist
76 countries and regions to implement

00:53:27.360 --> 00:53:27.370
76 countries and regions to implement
 

00:53:27.370 --> 00:53:28.530
76 countries and regions to implement
the international health regulations

00:53:28.530 --> 00:53:28.540
the international health regulations
 

00:53:28.540 --> 00:53:31.860
the international health regulations
that's a fantastic commitment but it's

00:53:31.860 --> 00:53:31.870
that's a fantastic commitment but it's
 

00:53:31.870 --> 00:53:34.230
that's a fantastic commitment but it's
really hard to track down who's done

00:53:34.230 --> 00:53:34.240
really hard to track down who's done
 

00:53:34.240 --> 00:53:36.750
really hard to track down who's done
what for how long and to measure the

00:53:36.750 --> 00:53:36.760
what for how long and to measure the
 

00:53:36.760 --> 00:53:38.610
what for how long and to measure the
results and I think that's another place

00:53:38.610 --> 00:53:38.620
results and I think that's another place
 

00:53:38.620 --> 00:53:40.890
results and I think that's another place
where civil society can really help by

00:53:40.890 --> 00:53:40.900
where civil society can really help by
 

00:53:40.900 --> 00:53:42.780
where civil society can really help by
measuring results by looking at what's

00:53:42.780 --> 00:53:42.790
measuring results by looking at what's
 

00:53:42.790 --> 00:53:44.700
measuring results by looking at what's
been done and by helping keep countries

00:53:44.700 --> 00:53:44.710
been done and by helping keep countries
 

00:53:44.710 --> 00:53:45.990
been done and by helping keep countries
on track for the commitments that

00:53:45.990 --> 00:53:46.000
on track for the commitments that
 

00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:49.830
on track for the commitments that
they've made second I mentioned the

00:53:49.830 --> 00:53:49.840
they've made second I mentioned the
 

00:53:49.840 --> 00:53:50.520
they've made second I mentioned the
countability

00:53:50.520 --> 00:53:50.530
countability
 

00:53:50.530 --> 00:53:52.980
countability
and I think if you look at what the

00:53:52.980 --> 00:53:52.990
and I think if you look at what the
 

00:53:52.990 --> 00:53:55.170
and I think if you look at what the
ultimate goal here is there'll be an

00:53:55.170 --> 00:53:55.180
ultimate goal here is there'll be an
 

00:53:55.180 --> 00:53:57.240
ultimate goal here is there'll be an
external evaluation in every country

00:53:57.240 --> 00:53:57.250
external evaluation in every country
 

00:53:57.250 --> 00:53:59.550
external evaluation in every country
every country will have a national plan

01:23:38.780 --> 01:23:41.020
so on and the issue politically is how
one leverages that and so I'm asking the

01:23:41.020 --> 01:23:41.030
one leverages that and so I'm asking the
 

01:23:41.030 --> 01:23:43.630
one leverages that and so I'm asking the
question how what is your view of how to

01:23:43.630 --> 01:23:43.640
question how what is your view of how to
 

01:23:43.640 --> 01:23:46.470
question how what is your view of how to
leverage that side of the funding

01:23:46.470 --> 01:23:46.480
leverage that side of the funding
 

01:23:46.480 --> 01:23:53.560
leverage that side of the funding
without compromising spending on health

01:23:53.560 --> 01:23:53.570
without compromising spending on health
 

01:23:53.570 --> 01:23:55.870
without compromising spending on health
as a public good because it's often the

01:23:55.870 --> 01:23:55.880
as a public good because it's often the
 

01:23:55.880 --> 01:23:58.270
as a public good because it's often the
criticism that health security has

01:23:58.270 --> 01:23:58.280
criticism that health security has
 

01:23:58.280 --> 01:24:00.000
criticism that health security has
dominated by military involvement

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:00.010
dominated by military involvement
 

01:24:00.010 --> 01:24:02.260
dominated by military involvement
focuses much more on the security side

01:24:02.260 --> 01:24:02.270
focuses much more on the security side
 

01:24:02.270 --> 01:24:04.090
focuses much more on the security side
rather than the public side in terms of

01:24:04.090 --> 01:24:04.100
rather than the public side in terms of
 

01:24:04.100 --> 01:24:06.540
rather than the public side in terms of
health

01:24:06.540 --> 01:24:06.550
 
 

01:24:06.550 --> 01:24:09.190
 
thank you those are both great questions

01:24:09.190 --> 01:24:09.200
thank you those are both great questions
 

01:24:09.200 --> 01:24:13.000
thank you those are both great questions
and I'm happy to to answer them so I

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:13.010
and I'm happy to to answer them so I
 

01:24:13.010 --> 01:24:15.400
and I'm happy to to answer them so I
think in terms of the US government

01:24:15.400 --> 01:24:15.410
think in terms of the US government
 

01:24:15.410 --> 01:24:17.220
think in terms of the US government
funding to take the first question first

01:24:17.220 --> 01:24:17.230
funding to take the first question first
 

01:24:17.230 --> 01:24:19.420
funding to take the first question first
so the US government received

01:24:19.420 --> 01:24:19.430
so the US government received
 

01:24:19.430 --> 01:24:22.000
so the US government received
approximately a billion dollars for

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:22.010
approximately a billion dollars for
 

01:24:22.010 --> 01:24:23.710
approximately a billion dollars for
global health security in the middle of

01:24:23.710 --> 01:24:23.720
global health security in the middle of
 

01:24:23.720 --> 01:24:26.380
global health security in the middle of
the Ebola outbreak and that was pretty

01:24:26.380 --> 01:24:26.390
the Ebola outbreak and that was pretty
 

01:24:26.390 --> 01:24:28.000
the Ebola outbreak and that was pretty
extraordinary to be honest with you

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:28.010
extraordinary to be honest with you
 

01:24:28.010 --> 01:24:29.740
extraordinary to be honest with you
because it was forward thinking it was

01:24:29.740 --> 01:24:29.750
because it was forward thinking it was
 

01:24:29.750 --> 01:24:31.810
because it was forward thinking it was
looking at the future while in the

01:24:31.810 --> 01:24:31.820
looking at the future while in the
 

01:24:31.820 --> 01:24:34.630
looking at the future while in the
middle of a crisis and so it was really

01:24:34.630 --> 01:24:34.640
middle of a crisis and so it was really
 

01:24:34.640 --> 01:24:36.010
middle of a crisis and so it was really
hard to get that funding out of a

01:24:36.010 --> 01:24:36.020
hard to get that funding out of a
 

01:24:36.020 --> 01:24:37.189
hard to get that funding out of a

I will tell you but but they they
provided it the critical point with that

01:24:43.370 --> 01:24:43.380
provided it the critical point with that
 

01:24:43.380 --> 01:24:45.080
provided it the critical point with that
funding though was that it was tied to

01:24:45.080 --> 01:24:45.090
funding though was that it was tied to
 

01:24:45.090 --> 01:24:47.330
funding though was that it was tied to
specific metrics that needed to be

01:24:47.330 --> 01:24:47.340
specific metrics that needed to be
 

01:24:47.340 --> 01:24:49.609
specific metrics that needed to be
achieved by the funders in cooperation

01:24:49.609 --> 01:24:49.619
achieved by the funders in cooperation
 

01:24:49.619 --> 01:24:50.689
achieved by the funders in cooperation
with the governments I don't mean to

with the governments I don't mean to
 

01:24:50.699 --> 01:24:52.339
with the governments I don't mean to
imply that all of those metrics were on

01:24:52.339 --> 01:24:52.349
imply that all of those metrics were on
 

01:24:52.349 --> 01:24:54.319

the countries they were also on our own

the countries they were also on our own
our own spending to make sure that we

01:24:57.529 --> 01:24:57.539
our own spending to make sure that we
 

01:24:57.539 --> 01:24:59.000
our own spending to make sure that we
understood what we were doing and that

it would actually help build sustainable

it would actually help build sustainable
 

01:25:01.139 --> 01:25:02.949
it would actually help build sustainable

ihr and that was essential the Office of

ihr and that was essential the Office of
 

01:25:06.479 --> 01:25:08.270

Management and Budget looked at the

01:25:08.270 --> 01:25:08.280
Management and Budget looked at the
 

01:25:08.280 --> 01:25:10.250
Management and Budget looked at the
global health security agenda and its

01:25:10.250 --> 01:25:10.260
global health security agenda and its
 

01:25:10.260 --> 01:25:12.080
global health security agenda and its
targets that had been built before the

01:25:12.080 --> 01:25:12.090
targets that had been built before the
 

01:25:12.090 --> 01:25:15.529
targets that had been built before the
funding came in and made the decision to

01:25:15.529 --> 01:25:15.539
funding came in and made the decision to
 

01:25:15.539 --> 01:25:17.330
funding came in and made the decision to
ask for that funding because they knew

01:25:17.330 --> 01:25:17.340
ask for that funding because they knew
 

01:25:17.340 --> 01:25:18.919
ask for that funding because they knew
that it could be measured because there

01:25:18.919 --> 01:25:18.929
that it could be measured because there
 

01:25:18.929 --> 01:25:20.479
that it could be measured because there
were some targets that had been achieved

01:25:20.479 --> 01:25:20.489
were some targets that had been achieved
 

01:25:20.489 --> 01:25:23.120
were some targets that had been achieved
and because w-h-o and others were

01:25:23.120 --> 01:25:23.130
and because w-h-o and others were
 

01:25:23.130 --> 01:25:24.680
and because w-h-o and others were
already at the table so that was

01:25:24.680 --> 01:25:24.690
already at the table so that was
 

01:25:24.690 --> 01:25:27.259
already at the table so that was
essential I think that in order to

01:25:27.259 --> 01:25:27.269
essential I think that in order to
 

01:25:27.269 --> 01:25:30.140
essential I think that in order to
maintain funding for global health

01:25:30.140 --> 01:25:30.150
maintain funding for global health
 

01:25:30.150 --> 01:25:33.229
maintain funding for global health
security in the current climate and I

security in the current climate and I
 

01:25:33.239 --> 01:25:34.370
security in the current climate and I
will say that the Trump administration

01:25:34.370 --> 01:25:34.380
will say that the Trump administration
 

01:25:34.380 --> 01:25:37.399
will say that the Trump administration
has supported this issue rhetorically

01:25:37.399 --> 01:25:37.409
has supported this issue rhetorically
 

01:25:37.409 --> 01:25:39.080
has supported this issue rhetorically
they've said they support global health

agenda I think in order to see funding

agenda I think in order to see funding
 

01:25:43.619 --> 01:25:45.529
agenda I think in order to see funding
for this there has to be an

01:25:45.529 --> 01:25:45.539
for this there has to be an
 

01:25:45.539 --> 01:25:48.949
for this there has to be an
extraordinary effort to advocate for it

01:25:48.949 --> 01:25:48.959
extraordinary effort to advocate for it
 

01:25:48.959 --> 01:25:51.529
extraordinary effort to advocate for it
and for Congress to provide it and to be

01:25:51.529 --> 01:25:51.539
and for Congress to provide it and to be
 

01:25:51.539 --> 01:25:54.589
and for Congress to provide it and to be
able to show that it is a common good

01:25:54.589 --> 01:25:54.599
able to show that it is a common good
 

01:25:54.599 --> 01:25:56.959
able to show that it is a common good
that is essential for global peace and

security and u.s. national security I
think those arguments can be made but I

01:26:02.149 --> 01:26:02.159
think those arguments can be made but I
 

01:26:02.159 --> 01:26:03.890
think those arguments can be made but I
think that the funding needs to come in

01:26:03.890 --> 01:26:03.900
think that the funding needs to come in
 

01:26:03.900 --> 01:26:07.790
think that the funding needs to come in
for CDC and USAID and the budgets that

01:26:07.790 --> 01:26:07.800
for CDC and USAID and the budgets that
 

01:26:07.800 --> 01:26:09.649
for CDC and USAID and the budgets that
are already out there for Department of

are already out there for Department of
 

01:26:09.659 --> 01:26:11.629
are already out there for Department of
Defense and state to be at the table and

Defense and state to be at the table and
 

01:26:11.639 --> 01:26:13.060
Defense and state to be at the table and
global health security needs to be

01:26:13.060 --> 01:26:13.070
global health security needs to be
 

01:26:13.070 --> 01:26:15.350
global health security needs to be
maintained because the multi sectoral

01:26:15.350 --> 01:26:15.360
maintained because the multi sectoral
 

01:26:15.360 --> 01:26:17.779
maintained because the multi sectoral
budget that we have helps bring multiple

01:26:17.779 --> 01:26:17.789
budget that we have helps bring multiple
 

01:26:17.789 --> 01:26:20.060
budget that we have helps bring multiple
sectors to the table in other countries

01:26:20.060 --> 01:26:20.070
sectors to the table in other countries
 

01:26:20.070 --> 01:26:21.469
sectors to the table in other countries
and that's very helpful

01:26:21.469 --> 01:26:21.479
and that's very helpful
 

01:26:21.479 --> 01:26:23.750
and that's very helpful
when when you're having financing

conversations and when you're trying to
 

01:26:25.469 --> 01:26:27.589
conversations and when you're trying to
look at measurable goals I'll take this

01:26:27.589 --> 01:26:27.599
look at measurable goals I'll take this

to what dr. Sachs said as well I I
completely agree with you that not all

01:26:35.149 --> 01:26:35.159
completely agree with you that not all
 

01:26:35.159 --> 01:26:37.910
completely agree with you that not all
countries can do this on their own and

01:26:37.910 --> 01:26:37.920
countries can do this on their own and
 

01:26:37.920 --> 01:26:40.250
countries can do this on their own and
absolutely shouldn't but I do think that

01:26:40.250 --> 01:26:40.260
absolutely shouldn't but I do think that
 

01:26:40.260 --> 01:26:42.259
absolutely shouldn't but I do think that

tailored to their priorities and needs
and that's vital and I think that that's

and that's vital and I think that that's
 

01:27:07.780 --> 01:27:09.750
and that's vital and I think that that's
helpful in bringing sectors of

01:31:02.230 --> 01:31:05.250
you dr. Schmidt can you tell us what
would be helpful to know about climate

01:31:05.250 --> 01:31:05.260
would be helpful to know about climate
 

01:31:05.260 --> 01:31:08.400
would be helpful to know about climate
in order for people who deliver vaccines

01:31:08.400 --> 01:31:08.410
in order for people who deliver vaccines
 

01:31:08.410 --> 01:31:10.470
in order for people who deliver vaccines
for example globally it's a logistical

01:31:10.470 --> 01:31:10.480
for example globally it's a logistical
 

01:31:10.480 --> 01:31:12.430
for example globally it's a logistical
question

01:31:12.430 --> 01:31:12.440
question
 

01:31:12.440 --> 01:31:14.169
question
what do you say should know about

01:31:14.169 --> 01:31:14.179
what do you say should know about
 

01:31:14.179 --> 01:31:17.169
what do you say should know about
climate variability that will allow them

01:31:17.169 --> 01:31:17.179
climate variability that will allow them
 

01:31:17.179 --> 01:31:20.169
climate variability that will allow them
to plan firmly effectively especially

01:31:20.169 --> 01:31:20.179
to plan firmly effectively especially
 

01:31:20.179 --> 01:31:22.600
to plan firmly effectively especially
when you're dealing with with

01:31:22.600 --> 01:31:22.610
when you're dealing with with
 

01:31:22.610 --> 01:31:29.770
when you're dealing with with
emergencies okay let me see if I can say

01:31:29.770 --> 01:31:29.780
emergencies okay let me see if I can say
 

01:31:29.780 --> 01:31:36.850
emergencies okay let me see if I can say
something intelligent so one of the

01:31:36.850 --> 01:31:36.860
something intelligent so one of the
 

01:31:36.860 --> 01:31:42.220
something intelligent so one of the
problems that exists in delivery of

01:31:42.220 --> 01:31:42.230
problems that exists in delivery of
 

01:31:42.230 --> 01:31:45.430
problems that exists in delivery of
vaccines and another medicine to to the

01:31:45.430 --> 01:31:45.440
vaccines and another medicine to to the
 

01:31:45.440 --> 01:31:47.529
vaccines and another medicine to to the
more flour flung and miss connected

01:31:47.529 --> 01:31:47.539
more flour flung and miss connected
 

01:31:47.539 --> 01:31:49.750
more flour flung and miss connected
parts of the world is that we don't

01:31:49.750 --> 01:31:49.760
parts of the world is that we don't
 

01:31:49.760 --> 01:31:51.520
parts of the world is that we don't
actually even have good weather

01:31:51.520 --> 01:31:51.530
actually even have good weather
 

01:31:51.530 --> 01:31:54.520
actually even have good weather
forecasts for these places because we

01:31:54.520 --> 01:31:54.530
forecasts for these places because we
 

01:31:54.530 --> 01:31:57.189
forecasts for these places because we
don't have enough in sits you on the

01:31:57.189 --> 01:31:57.199
don't have enough in sits you on the
 

01:31:57.199 --> 01:32:00.910
don't have enough in sits you on the
ground measurements of temperature and

01:32:00.910 --> 01:32:00.920
ground measurements of temperature and
 

01:32:00.920 --> 01:32:03.790
ground measurements of temperature and
rainfall and the winds that would be

01:32:03.790 --> 01:32:03.800
rainfall and the winds that would be
 

01:32:03.800 --> 01:32:05.919
rainfall and the winds that would be
able to feed into the global models that

01:32:05.919 --> 01:32:05.929
able to feed into the global models that
 

01:32:05.929 --> 01:32:08.379
able to feed into the global models that
produce the forecasts that can be useful

01:32:08.379 --> 01:32:08.389
produce the forecasts that can be useful
 

01:32:08.389 --> 01:32:12.759
produce the forecasts that can be useful
and so our our ability even to forecast

01:32:12.759 --> 01:32:12.769
and so our our ability even to forecast
 

01:32:12.769 --> 01:32:14.680
and so our our ability even to forecast
the weather in places like Central

01:32:14.680 --> 01:32:14.690
the weather in places like Central
 

01:32:14.690 --> 01:32:18.729
the weather in places like Central
Africa is is much poorer than our

01:32:18.729 --> 01:32:18.739
Africa is is much poorer than our
 

01:32:18.739 --> 01:32:20.259
Africa is is much poorer than our
ability to forecast the weather in the

01:32:20.259 --> 01:32:20.269
ability to forecast the weather in the
 

01:32:20.269 --> 01:32:23.799
ability to forecast the weather in the
US or in Europe those are things that

01:32:23.799 --> 01:32:23.809
US or in Europe those are things that
 

01:32:23.809 --> 01:32:28.089
US or in Europe those are things that
can be fixed with you know increasing

01:32:28.089 --> 01:32:28.099
can be fixed with you know increasing
 

01:32:28.099 --> 01:32:30.490
can be fixed with you know increasing

Ericsson that Columbia worked with to to
 

01:32:35.480 --> 01:32:37.779
Ericsson that Columbia worked with to to
put automatic weather stations on cell

01:32:37.779 --> 01:32:37.789
put automatic weather stations on cell
 

01:32:37.789 --> 01:32:40.209
put automatic weather stations on cell
phone towers so that as the cellphone

01:32:40.209 --> 01:32:40.219
phone towers so that as the cellphone
 

01:32:40.219 --> 01:32:43.120

issues but the whole notion that you
 

01:33:07.519 --> 01:33:09.009
issues but the whole notion that you
need to be thinking about the

happen even in the short term is
 

01:33:16.760 --> 01:33:18.790
happen even in the short term is
obviously something that we work quite a

when it comes to vaccine development and
 

01:34:10.550 --> 01:34:13.120
when it comes to vaccine development and
so it's an R&amp;D process and there has to

01:34:13.120 --> 01:34:13.130
so it's an R&amp;D process and there has to
 

01:34:13.130 --> 01:34:17.170
so it's an R&amp;D process and there has to
be a pipeline that's available to

be a pipeline that's available to
 

01:34:17.180 --> 01:34:19.840
be a pipeline that's available to
produce those vaccines I mean what is

01:34:19.840 --> 01:34:19.850
produce those vaccines I mean what is
 

01:34:19.850 --> 01:34:22.360
produce those vaccines I mean what is
what is the perspective on the part of

01:34:22.360 --> 01:34:22.370
what is the perspective on the part of

vaccines and research I think it will be

01:34:35.380 --> 01:34:35.390
vaccines and research I think it will be
 

01:34:35.390 --> 01:34:38.770
vaccines and research I think it will be
important first of all for those with

public health importance government
 

01:34:43.160 --> 01:34:46.540
public health importance government
should invest governments should be

01:34:46.540 --> 01:34:46.550
should invest governments should be
 

01:34:46.550 --> 01:34:49.540
should invest governments should be
willing to invest because there are

01:34:49.540 --> 01:34:49.550
willing to invest because there are
 

01:34:49.550 --> 01:34:51.790
willing to invest because there are
market failures where the private sector

01:34:51.790 --> 01:34:51.800
market failures where the private sector
 

01:34:51.800 --> 01:34:54.040
market failures where the private sector
will never go into that territory so

01:34:54.040 --> 01:34:54.050
will never go into that territory so
 

01:34:54.050 --> 01:34:58.030
will never go into that territory so
that's one and the second for those that

01:34:58.030 --> 01:34:58.040
that's one and the second for those that
 

01:34:58.040 --> 01:35:00.700
that's one and the second for those that
have some interest in the private sector

01:35:00.700 --> 01:35:00.710
have some interest in the private sector
 

01:35:00.710 --> 01:35:05.310
have some interest in the private sector
I think the advanced market commitment

01:35:05.310 --> 01:35:05.320
I think the advanced market commitment
 

01:35:05.320 --> 01:35:08.410
I think the advanced market commitment
that gabby is doing would be important

01:35:08.410 --> 01:35:08.420
that gabby is doing would be important
 

01:35:08.420 --> 01:35:10.360
that gabby is doing would be important
to a combination of the two so

01:35:10.360 --> 01:35:10.370
to a combination of the two so
 

01:35:10.370 --> 01:35:13.210
to a combination of the two so
governments plus the advanced market

01:35:13.210 --> 01:35:13.220
governments plus the advanced market
 

01:35:13.220 --> 01:35:16.840
governments plus the advanced market
commitment for the private sector this

01:35:16.840 --> 01:35:16.850
commitment for the private sector this
 

01:35:16.850 --> 01:35:19.810
commitment for the private sector this
will really help by the way on the drugs

01:35:19.810 --> 01:35:19.820
will really help by the way on the drugs
 

01:35:19.820 --> 01:35:22.810
will really help by the way on the drugs
for hepatitis C one

01:35:22.810 --> 01:35:22.820
for hepatitis C one
 

01:35:22.820 --> 01:35:29.640
for hepatitis C one
area is general so we're doing that and

01:35:29.640 --> 01:35:29.650
area is general so we're doing that and
 

01:35:29.650 --> 01:35:34.510
area is general so we're doing that and
hundred twenty US dollars so that will

01:35:34.510 --> 01:35:34.520
hundred twenty US dollars so that will
 

01:35:34.520 --> 01:35:36.760
hundred twenty US dollars so that will
will help and we can go to elimination

01:35:36.760 --> 01:35:36.770
will help and we can go to elimination
 

01:35:36.770 --> 01:35:46.230
will help and we can go to elimination
now so in addition to generic I think

01:35:46.230 --> 01:35:46.240
now so in addition to generic I think
 

01:35:46.240 --> 01:35:49.960
now so in addition to generic I think

01:36:00.040 --> 01:36:00.050
under the go global program many
 

01:36:00.050 --> 01:36:02.110
under the go global program many
manufacturing industries are migrating

01:36:02.110 --> 01:36:02.120
manufacturing industries are migrating
 

01:36:02.120 --> 01:36:04.000
manufacturing industries are migrating
out of China and that's very good

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:04.010
out of China and that's very good
 

01:36:04.010 --> 01:36:06.970
out of China and that's very good
opportunity with the increasing wage in

01:36:06.970 --> 01:36:06.980
opportunity with the increasing wage in
 

01:36:06.980 --> 01:36:10.990
opportunity with the increasing wage in
China some industries migrating towards

01:36:10.990 --> 01:36:11.000
China some industries migrating towards
 

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.720
China some industries migrating towards
the developing world and that could be

01:36:13.720 --> 01:36:13.730
the developing world and that could be
 

01:36:13.730 --> 01:36:16.120
the developing world and that could be
used to increase the manufacturing

01:36:16.120 --> 01:36:16.130
used to increase the manufacturing
 

01:36:16.130 --> 01:36:18.480
used to increase the manufacturing
capacity of the developing world

01:36:18.480 --> 01:36:18.490
capacity of the developing world
 

01:36:18.490 --> 01:36:22.120
capacity of the developing world
industrialization can come with that and

01:36:22.120 --> 01:36:22.130
industrialization can come with that and
 

01:36:22.130 --> 01:36:24.120
industrialization can come with that and
industrialization as you know means

01:36:24.120 --> 01:36:24.130
industrialization as you know means
 

01:36:24.130 --> 01:36:28.110
industrialization as you know means
innovation too so I think using those

01:36:28.110 --> 01:36:28.120
innovation too so I think using those
 

01:36:28.120 --> 01:36:31.000
innovation too so I think using those
opportunities will be important so that

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:31.010
opportunities will be important so that
 

01:36:31.010 --> 01:36:32.520
opportunities will be important so that
could be applied for drugs

01:36:32.520 --> 01:36:32.530
could be applied for drugs
 

01:36:32.530 --> 01:36:37.090
could be applied for drugs
that could be applied for vaccines as we

01:36:37.090 --> 01:36:37.100
that could be applied for vaccines as we
 

01:36:37.100 --> 01:36:40.870
that could be applied for vaccines as we
know many of the expensive medicines or

01:36:40.870 --> 01:36:40.880
know many of the expensive medicines or
 

01:36:40.880 --> 01:36:43.780
know many of the expensive medicines or
vaccines at the end of the day the issue

01:36:43.780 --> 01:36:43.790
vaccines at the end of the day the issue
 

01:36:43.790 --> 01:36:49.660
vaccines at the end of the day the issue
is we the supply and demand issue so if

01:36:49.660 --> 01:36:49.670
is we the supply and demand issue so if
 

01:36:49.670 --> 01:36:53.500
is we the supply and demand issue so if
there is if we increase supply then the

01:36:53.500 --> 01:36:53.510
there is if we increase supply then the
 

01:36:53.510 --> 01:36:56.350
there is if we increase supply then the
price could be lowered and that's why

01:36:56.350 --> 01:36:56.360
price could be lowered and that's why
 

01:36:56.360 --> 01:36:58.800
price could be lowered and that's why
increasing the manufacturing industry of

01:36:58.800 --> 01:36:58.810
increasing the manufacturing industry of
 

01:36:58.810 --> 01:37:02.040
increasing the manufacturing industry of
developing world could increase

01:37:02.040 --> 01:37:02.050
developing world could increase
 

01:37:02.050 --> 01:37:05.320
developing world could increase
competition can bring competition and

01:37:05.320 --> 01:37:05.330
competition can bring competition and
 

01:37:05.330 --> 01:37:08.500
competition can bring competition and
that can can can help so long term I

01:37:08.500 --> 01:37:08.510
that can can can help so long term I
 

01:37:08.510 --> 01:37:10.540
that can can can help so long term I
think we have to consider those course

01:37:10.540 --> 01:37:10.550
think we have to consider those course
 

01:37:10.550 --> 01:37:11.980
think we have to consider those course
there was a high-level panel

01:37:11.980 --> 01:37:11.990
there was a high-level panel
 

01:37:11.990 --> 01:37:14.440
there was a high-level panel
recommendation last year and there are

adaptation that's wrong of course it

01:37:48.950 --> 01:37:48.960
adaptation that's wrong of course it
 

01:37:48.960 --> 01:37:50.630
adaptation that's wrong of course it
should work on adaptation but it should

01:37:50.630 --> 01:37:50.640
should work on adaptation but it should
 

01:37:50.640 --> 01:37:54.710
should work on adaptation but it should
do more on mitigation the health impacts

01:37:54.710 --> 01:37:54.720
do more on mitigation the health impacts
 

01:37:54.720 --> 01:37:59.030
do more on mitigation the health impacts
of increased carbon release I think and

01:37:59.030 --> 01:37:59.040
of increased carbon release I think and
 

01:37:59.040 --> 01:38:02.420
of increased carbon release I think and
its impact on health WH er should really

01:38:02.420 --> 01:38:02.430
its impact on health WH er should really
 

01:38:02.430 --> 01:38:03.530
its impact on health WH er should really
raise the alarm

01:38:03.530 --> 01:38:03.540
raise the alarm
 

01:38:03.540 --> 01:38:07.430
raise the alarm
so more advocacy and very vocal one on

01:38:07.430 --> 01:38:07.440
so more advocacy and very vocal one on
 

01:38:07.440 --> 01:38:09.620
so more advocacy and very vocal one on
mitigation because mitigation is

01:38:09.620 --> 01:38:09.630
mitigation because mitigation is
 

01:38:09.630 --> 01:38:10.600

nwj is for prevention so we cannot just
 

01:38:13.700 --> 01:38:18.830
nwj is for prevention so we cannot just
be on adaptation and only you know fix

01:38:18.830 --> 01:38:18.840
be on adaptation and only you know fix
 

01:38:18.840 --> 01:38:20.510
be on adaptation and only you know fix
the problems at their rise which we

the problems at their rise which we
 

01:38:20.520 --> 01:38:23.150
the problems at their rise which we
cannot fix anyway and climate change is

01:38:23.150 --> 01:38:23.160
cannot fix anyway and climate change is
 

01:38:23.160 --> 01:38:25.280

and Columbia University I know we will
 

01:39:18.300 --> 01:39:22.580
and Columbia University I know we will
help in making this succeed but we have

01:39:22.580 --> 01:39:22.590
help in making this succeed but we have
 

01:39:22.590 --> 01:39:25.540
help in making this succeed but we have
to really help those who really

for Zika and what I said was two reasons
 

01:39:43.230 --> 01:39:45.080
for Zika and what I said was two reasons
one was the epidemiology of Zika and the

question of the production of vaccines
 

01:39:52.920 --> 01:39:55.580
question of the production of vaccines
has been a boom and bust business so

01:39:55.580 --> 01:39:55.590
has been a boom and bust business so
 

01:39:55.590 --> 01:39:57.410
has been a boom and bust business so
when is a crisis there's a lot of

when is a crisis there's a lot of
 

01:39:57.420 --> 01:39:59.959
when is a crisis there's a lot of

minute herbs is the climb so and so it

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:05.010
minute herbs is the climb so and so it
 

01:40:05.010 --> 01:40:08.169
minute herbs is the climb so and so it
is a risky investment so the question is

01:40:08.169 --> 01:40:08.179
is a risky investment so the question is
 

01:40:08.179 --> 01:40:11.500
is a risky investment so the question is
how do we get a promised stable funding

01:40:11.500 --> 01:40:11.510
how do we get a promised stable funding
 

01:40:11.510 --> 01:40:14.300
how do we get a promised stable funding
in the vaccine business and I raise it

01:40:14.300 --> 01:40:14.310
in the vaccine business and I raise it
 

01:40:14.310 --> 01:40:16.609
in the vaccine business and I raise it
as an issue and I thought that it's part

01:40:16.609 --> 01:40:16.619
as an issue and I thought that it's part
 

01:40:16.619 --> 01:40:18.470

of your response Jeff you might be able
 

01:40:18.480 --> 01:40:24.220
of your response Jeff you might be able
to comment on that too I think about

01:40:24.220 --> 01:40:24.230
to comment on that too I think about
 

01:40:24.230 --> 01:40:28.189
to comment on that too I think about

vaccine he was asked famously so who
 

01:40:50.850 --> 01:40:54.830
vaccine he was asked famously so who
owns the vaccine who owns the the patent

01:40:54.830 --> 01:40:54.840
owns the vaccine who owns the the patent
 

01:40:54.840 --> 01:40:57.140
owns the vaccine who owns the the patent
and he said the public of course he said

01:40:57.140 --> 01:40:57.150
and he said the public of course he said

the verge of full eradication but the
 

01:41:15.690 --> 01:41:17.959
the verge of full eradication but the
point is that it was it's a different

responsibility but we have to actually

01:43:26.930 --> 01:43:26.940
responsibility but we have to actually

be held to account for the
 

01:43:28.710 --> 01:43:34.700
be held to account for the
responsibility so I want to put aid not

01:43:34.700 --> 01:43:34.710
responsibility so I want to put aid not
 

01:43:34.710 --> 01:43:37.220
responsibility so I want to put aid not
as the relevant category here I want to

I thought that was the question anyway I
 

01:46:21.440 --> 01:46:24.520
I thought that was the question anyway I
can reframe it like a question I mean

01:46:24.520 --> 01:46:24.530
can reframe it like a question I mean
 

01:46:24.530 --> 01:46:26.439

health agenda and how the private sector
 

01:46:37.760 --> 01:46:39.790
health agenda and how the private sector
can fill in those gaps that you could

01:46:39.790 --> 01:46:39.800
can fill in those gaps that you could
 

01:46:39.800 --> 01:46:42.070
can fill in those gaps that you could
identify and then also how you can

01:46:42.070 --> 01:46:42.080
identify and then also how you can
 

01:46:42.080 --> 01:46:44.770
identify and then also how you can
incentivize the private sector to take

01:46:44.770 --> 01:46:44.780
incentivize the private sector to take
 

01:46:44.780 --> 01:46:46.600
incentivize the private sector to take

01:46:49.209 --> 01:46:49.219
and be a part of your solution by the
 

01:46:49.219 --> 01:46:51.160
and be a part of your solution by the
way one of the opportunities we have is

01:46:51.160 --> 01:46:51.170
way one of the opportunities we have is
 

01:46:51.170 --> 01:46:54.820
way one of the opportunities we have is
the fencer it's a framework to engage

01:46:54.820 --> 01:46:54.830
the fencer it's a framework to engage
 

01:46:54.830 --> 01:46:58.959
the fencer it's a framework to engage
the private non-state actors private

01:46:58.959 --> 01:46:58.969
the private non-state actors private

sector being being one so we have that

01:47:02.080 --> 01:47:02.090
sector being being one so we have that
 

01:47:02.090 --> 01:47:05.110
sector being being one so we have that
framework that was endorsed it last year

01:47:05.110 --> 01:47:05.120
framework that was endorsed it last year
 

01:47:05.120 --> 01:47:08.520
framework that was endorsed it last year
so based on that that opens up

01:47:08.520 --> 01:47:08.530
so based on that that opens up
 

01:47:08.530 --> 01:47:11.290
so based on that that opens up
opportunities to engage the non-state

01:47:11.290 --> 01:47:11.300
opportunities to engage the non-state
 

01:47:11.300 --> 01:47:14.770
opportunities to engage the non-state
actors and we will try to benefit from

01:47:14.770 --> 01:47:14.780
actors and we will try to benefit from
 

01:47:14.780 --> 01:47:19.090
actors and we will try to benefit from
their contribution but we have to I

01:47:19.090 --> 01:47:19.100
their contribution but we have to I
 

01:47:19.100 --> 01:47:25.030

01:47:31.760 --> 01:47:35.050
sector I think that's what you're up to
and we shouldn't really be worried by

and we shouldn't really be worried by
 

01:47:35.060 --> 01:47:36.430
and we shouldn't really be worried by
that there shouldn't be even any

we know where the conflicts of interest
may arise we should be conscious about

01:47:44.890 --> 01:47:44.900
may arise we should be conscious about
 

01:47:44.900 --> 01:47:47.770
may arise we should be conscious about
that but there shouldn't be fear in

01:47:47.770 --> 01:47:47.780

a strategy based on the priorities that

01:48:17.410 --> 01:48:17.420
a strategy based on the priorities that
 

01:48:17.420 --> 01:48:21.190
a strategy based on the priorities that

we have to seek their engagement first
 

01:48:21.200 --> 01:48:23.770

priorities and the engagement should not
 

01:48:30.200 --> 01:48:34.390
priorities and the engagement should not
be at the global level only it should go

01:48:34.390 --> 01:48:34.400
be at the global level only it should go
 

01:48:34.400 --> 01:48:36.040
be at the global level only it should go
up to country level on how the

center for health security is a global
 

01:59:40.540 --> 01:59:42.210
center for health security is a global
health security index and whether it's

01:59:42.210 --> 01:59:42.220
health security index and whether it's
 

01:59:42.220 --> 01:59:45.320
health security index and whether it's
possible to create one and using

01:59:45.320 --> 01:59:45.330
possible to create one and using
 

01:59:45.330 --> 01:59:48.330

indicators not just from that not just

01:59:48.330 --> 01:59:48.340
indicators not just from that not just
 

01:59:48.340 --> 01:59:49.920

preparedness but indicators that also
 

01:59:52.120 --> 01:59:53.850
preparedness but indicators that also
track back to community health in the

01:59:53.850 --> 01:59:53.860
track back to community health in the
 

01:59:53.860 --> 01:59:56.490
track back to community health in the
overall health system and so we're just

01:59:56.490 --> 01:59:56.500
overall health system and so we're just
 

01:59:56.500 --> 01:59:58.020
overall health system and so we're just
completing the pilot phase of this

01:59:58.020 --> 01:59:58.030
completing the pilot phase of this
 

01:59:58.030 --> 02:00:00.390
completing the pilot phase of this
project but hopeful that a tool like

02:00:00.390 --> 02:00:00.400
project but hopeful that a tool like
 

02:00:00.400 --> 02:00:03.000
project but hopeful that a tool like
that would would help look at all of all

02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:03.010
that would would help look at all of all
 

02:00:03.010 --> 02:00:06.330

so that better decisions can be made
 

02:00:08.770 --> 02:00:11.250
so that better decisions can be made
about who's who's at risk and also what

02:00:11.250 --> 02:00:11.260
about who's who's at risk and also what
 

02:00:11.260 --> 02:00:12.990
about who's who's at risk and also what
the real risks are so we're including

02:00:12.990 --> 02:00:13.000
the real risks are so we're including
 

02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:14.820

that funding but how do we bring these

02:01:51.990 --> 02:01:52.000
that funding but how do we bring these
 

02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:55.080

these programs that seem for a lot of
people I think to be very far off issues

02:02:09.230 --> 02:02:09.240
 
 

02:02:09.240 --> 02:02:11.700
 
so professor stacks I thought that it

02:02:11.700 --> 02:02:11.710
so professor stacks I thought that it
 

02:02:11.710 --> 02:02:13.380

your introduction to talk about drug

02:02:15.060 --> 02:02:15.070
your introduction to talk about drug
 

02:02:15.070 --> 02:02:17.940
your introduction to talk about drug
pricing and you talked about the cost of

02:02:17.940 --> 02:02:17.950
pricing and you talked about the cost of
 

02:02:17.950 --> 02:02:19.980
pricing and you talked about the cost of
manufacturing of a drug but you didn't

02:02:19.980 --> 02:02:19.990
manufacturing of a drug but you didn't
 

02:02:19.990 --> 02:02:21.750
manufacturing of a drug but you didn't
talk about the cost of drug discovery

02:02:21.750 --> 02:02:21.760
talk about the cost of drug discovery
 

02:02:21.760 --> 02:02:26.820
talk about the cost of drug discovery
and just how long like simple statistics

02:02:26.820 --> 02:02:26.830
and just how long like simple statistics
 

02:02:26.830 --> 02:02:29.130

to you know an actual marketed product

02:02:32.370 --> 02:02:32.380
to you know an actual marketed product
 

02:02:32.380 --> 02:02:34.650
to you know an actual marketed product
and clinical the cost of clinical trials

02:02:34.650 --> 02:02:34.660
and clinical the cost of clinical trials
 

02:02:34.660 --> 02:02:36.890
and clinical the cost of clinical trials
and all those things so how can you

02:02:36.890 --> 02:02:36.900
and all those things so how can you
 

02:02:36.900 --> 02:02:40.170
and all those things so how can you
finance the drug discovery aspect of the

02:02:40.170 --> 02:02:40.180
finance the drug discovery aspect of the
 

02:02:40.180 --> 02:02:42.870
finance the drug discovery aspect of the
R&amp;D process and also incentivize again

02:02:42.870 --> 02:02:42.880
