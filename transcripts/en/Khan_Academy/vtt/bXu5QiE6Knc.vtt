00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.420
- [Kim] Hi, this is Kim from Khan Academy.

00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:07.420
Today you are Roe versus
Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:09.980
case that ruled that the right of privacy

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:13.200
extends to a woman's
decision to have an abortion.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.090
To learn more about Roe versus Wade,

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:17.310
I spoke to two experts on the case.

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.670
Clarke Forsythe is Senior
Counsel for Americans

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.150
United for Life and the
author of Abuse of Discretion:

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.460
The Inside Story of Roe V. Wade.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.910
Melissa Murray is the Alexander
F. and May T. Morrison

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.500
Professor of Law at Berkeley Law School,

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.020
where she also serves
as the Faculty Director

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:37.740
for the Center for Reproductive
Rights and Justice.

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:41.190
Mr. Forsythe, could you set
the stage for us a little bit.

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.350
What was going on at this time period?

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.100
- [Clarke] Well, there
were efforts in the 1960s

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.880
to repeal abortion laws in the states

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:54.880
and when abortion
activists were dissatisfied

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.140
with those efforts, they
decided to go into the courts.

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.140
And around 1969, they took
some cases into the courts

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:08.280
and ultimately, there
were 20 or more cases

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.480
challenging state laws in the courts

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:16.480
between 1969 and 1973 and Roe versus Wade

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.290
was the case from Texas.

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.240
- [Melissa] Roe was
litigated in the early 1970s.

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.360
It was a period of enormous
change in the United States.

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.220
We were beginning to see
beginnings of the women's

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.790
rights movements, the
beginning of the gay rights

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:35.707
movement, and of course,
the civil rights movement

00:01:35.707 --> 00:01:40.380
of the 1960s was moving in a
lot of different directions.

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.190
At the time, the question
of abortion was very much

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:47.460
on the minds of lots of
different state legislatures

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.750
because there had been moves to liberalize

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.650
much of the criminal law that dealt

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.871
with matters of sex and
sexuality, including abortion.

00:01:56.871 --> 00:02:00.990
At the time, four
states, New York, Alaska,

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.140
Hawaii, and I believe
Washington, had actually

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.580
taken steps to repeal their
laws criminalizing abortion.

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.680
And about 13 other
states had taken efforts

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.240
to liberalize their laws
criminalizing abortions,

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.930
but in number of other states, around,

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.850
at least 20 or more, there
remained on the books,

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.610
laws that absolutely
criminalized abortion,

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.030
except in situations where
it would be necessary

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.850
to preserve the woman's health or life,

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:35.090
or in cases of rape,
incest, or fetal anomaly.

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.010
- [Clarke] Abortion
rights attorneys sought

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.040
plaintiffs who could
challenge the Texas law

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.150
and the Georgia law.

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.570
There were two attorneys from Texas

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:51.570
who found Norma McCorvey,
who they gave the pseudonym

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.060
of Jane Roe, for purposes
of protecting her privacy.

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.283
And she became the nominal plaintiff.

00:03:00.162 --> 00:03:03.560
- [Melissa] And so Norma
McCorvey brought this case.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.680
She was a 22 year old woman
living in Dallas County, Texas,

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.460
who found herself pregnant
for the third time.

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:13.860
She was unmarried, her
first child had been born,

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.530
a daughter, and she had ultimately signed

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.470
over custody of her daughter
to her mother to raise,

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.510
because she was having
a bit of itinerant life,

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.750
was unable to take care of her child.

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.510
The second child that she
bore, she gave up for adoption.

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.030
And so when she found herself pregnant

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.460
for a third time, she wasn't willing to do

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:35.020
either of these things
again and wanted to safely

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:37.040
and legally terminate her pregnancy.

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.100
But this was impossible
under the Texas law.

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:43.450
Texas had, since the
19th century absolutely

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:45.770
criminalized abortion except in cases

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:47.320
where it was necessary for the health

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:48.720
and safety of the mother.

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.600
And so she then was
faced with the question

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.160
of what was she going to do.

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.110
And the only thing she
could think to do then,

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.130
was to actually challenge the law.

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:00.520
So she was put in contact
with Sarah Weddington

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:02.870
and Linda Coffee, two young women who had

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:04.560
recently graduated from law school.

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.070
Sarah Weddington was only 26 years old

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:10.590
at the time she helped Norma
McCorvey bring this case.

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:13.550
But they decided to sue the State of Texas

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:15.691
to challenge the constitutionality

00:04:15.691 --> 00:04:18.300
of Texas' criminal abortion ban.

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:21.390
- [Clarke] But as the history shows,

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:25.000
there was no trial, there was no evidence,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.830
there were no expert witnesses.

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:28.880
Jane Roe never testified.

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.420
As you know, she never got an abortion.

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:35.420
She gave birth and placed
her child for adoption.

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:40.270
- [Kim] Okay, so Roe was
Norma McCorvey, who was Wade?

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.510
- [Clarke] Henry Wade
was the District Attorney

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:48.500
for Dallas, Texas,
where the case was filed

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:50.860
in Federal District Court.

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:54.410
- [Kim] So this case,
I assume kind of wends

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:58.470
it's way through the courts and how did

00:04:58.470 --> 00:04:59.880
the Supreme Court rule?

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:04.730
- [Clarke] The Justices
declared the Texas and Georgia

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:09.660
laws unconstitutional and then rewrote

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:14.660
a national law, a national abortion law,

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:17.650
in which they said that the states could

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:21.220
not regulate or limit abortion
in the first trimester.

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:24.840
They could regulate more
in the second trimester,

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:27.380
the second three months of pregnancy,

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:30.970
to protect maternal health
and they could regulate

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:34.610
in the last three months of
pregnancy, the last trimester,

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:37.780
to protect maternal health or fetal life.

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:40.200
The attorneys for the plaintiffs claimed

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:44.160
that abortion fell within
the right to privacy,

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:46.080
even though privacy is not in the text

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:49.190
of the Constitution,
they said it was derived,

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:52.310
or based in the language
of the 14th amendment

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:55.080
of the Constitution even
though the 14th amendment

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:56.639
doesn't say anything about abortion,

00:05:56.639 --> 00:06:00.750
or the unborn child, it
just uses the term liberty.

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:03.610
And ultimately the Court
said that the right

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:06.260
to abortion is part of
the right to privacy

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:07.950
based on the 14th amendment.

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:08.890
- [Kim] That's very interesting.

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:11.010
So I've learned through
many of these interviews,

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:12.558
that this right to privacy is something

00:06:12.558 --> 00:06:15.084
that is never actually explicitly stated

00:06:15.084 --> 00:06:19.584
throughout the Bill of
Rights, but there's a penumbra

00:06:19.584 --> 00:06:22.670
of privacy that you see in a few ways.

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:25.330
What was the Court's
reasoning that it was abortion

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:28.620
that could fall under
this zone of privacy?

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:30.790
- [Clarke] If you read the Roe opinion,

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:35.560
on page 152 of the Roe
opinion, Justice Blackmun

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:38.820
starts out by saying
that, he cites a string

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:42.460
of cases since about 1910, a string

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:44.900
of Supreme Court cases
and says that these lead

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:48.930
to the right of privacy
and we think abortion,

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:51.180
or that the right of
privacy is broad enough

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:52.680
to encompass abortion.

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:56.450
But then four pages later, on page 156,

00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:59.150
Blackmun turns around
and says, but abortion

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:02.100
because it involves the taking of a life,

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:06.199
is inherently different
from all those other cases

00:07:06.199 --> 00:07:08.490
that make up the right of privacy.

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:10.240
- [Melissa] So the
right of privacy doesn't

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:12.550
actually come from Roe versus Wade,

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:16.360
it comes from a case decided
about eight years earlier,

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:19.471
in 1965 called, Griswold
versus Connecticut.

00:07:19.471 --> 00:07:23.590
In Griswold, at issue was
a Connecticut state statute

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:26.270
that made it a crime to use contraception

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:30.250
or even to counsel patients
about contraception.

00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:33.450
Planned Parenthood League
of Connecticut opened up

00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:36.680
a birth control clinic in
New Haven, Connecticut.

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:38.990
They were promptly arrested and the clinic

00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:41.563
was closed and then they
were able to bring this case.

00:07:41.563 --> 00:07:44.960
And they argued that the right to be able

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:47.620
to use contraception was
the right of the individual.

00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:49.460
The right of the doctor to advise patients

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:52.180
about contraception was
also an individual right.

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:54.150
And the Court, in an opinion authored

00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:57.290
by William O. Douglas agrees with them.

00:07:57.290 --> 00:08:00.710
And the Court articulates
for the first time

00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:03.670
this right of privacy and this is a right

00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:07.210
that the majority in
Griswold says is actually

00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:10.500
been percolating in the Court's
decisions for some time.

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:12.520
- [Kim] Did any of the Justices dissent

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:15.400
in the Roe decision and if so, why?

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:17.920
- [Clarke] Well there were two dissents

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:22.430
by Justice White and by Justice Rehnquist

00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:26.500
and Justice White said that the Court

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:30.684
was engaging in raw judicial power

00:08:30.684 --> 00:08:35.684
and that the Justices
did not have the right

00:08:38.128 --> 00:08:41.780
or the authority to strike
down the abortion laws

00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:45.690
of the States and could not rely upon

00:08:45.690 --> 00:08:48.410
a doctrine called,
substantive due process.

00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:53.407
Justice Rehnquist said that
there is clear historical

00:08:54.670 --> 00:08:58.490
evidence that many states
passed abortion limits

00:08:58.490 --> 00:09:01.000
and prohibitions precisely at the time

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.040
of the framing of the 14th
amendment in the 1860s

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:09.150
leading up to 1868 and
that the evidentiary

00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:11.090
history, this history of state limits

00:09:11.090 --> 00:09:13.590
and prohibitions on abortion contradicted

00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:15.680
any proposition that the 14th amendment

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:18.320
was intended to include
a right to abortion

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:21.830
and that was kind of the
heart of his dissent.

00:09:21.830 --> 00:09:25.040
- [Kim] So Roe was not the last word

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:26.990
on abortion in the United States.

00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:28.530
There have been several later cases

00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:29.950
that were important to this as well,

00:09:29.950 --> 00:09:31.940
like Planned Parenthood versus Casey,

00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:34.330
or Whole Woman's Health
versus Hellerstedt.

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:36.500
Can you talk a little
bit about how those cases

00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:38.900
have altered the scope
of the right to abortion?

00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:42.530
- [Melissa] As soon as
Roe is decided in 1973,

00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:45.210
there is an effort to sort of roll it back

00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:47.100
and hem it in a little bit.

00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:49.550
Frank Church, who's a Senator from Idaho,

00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:52.900
announces the Church
amendment, which basically says

00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:56.471
that physicians don't
have to perform abortions

00:09:56.471 --> 00:09:59.700
if doing so would conflict
with their conscience

00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:01.050
or conscientious beliefs.

00:10:01.050 --> 00:10:04.060
So, again, that's one
opportunity to sort of limit

00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:06.210
the reach of this right,
by limiting the number

00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:09.820
of providers who are
available to offer abortions.

00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:13.490
- [Clarke] In fact the
Court has kind of cut back

00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:18.130
on Roe versus Wade in
four cases over the years.

00:10:18.130 --> 00:10:21.090
Harris versus McRae
involving abortion funding.

00:10:21.090 --> 00:10:24.597
Planned Parenthood versus
Casey and in other cases,

00:10:24.597 --> 00:10:26.810
they've given more
deference to the states,

00:10:26.810 --> 00:10:30.690
allowed the states to
pass more and more limits

00:10:30.690 --> 00:10:34.220
at least around the
margins, even though they've

00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:37.540
continued holding to the basic right

00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:40.840
that Roe created, that there
was a right to abortion

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:44.380
for virtually any reason,
at any time of pregnancy.

00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:46.920
That's still the scope of the right,

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:48.623
but they've allowed marginal regulations,

00:10:48.623 --> 00:10:51.360
like limits on public
funding, parental notice

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:53.559
and consent, informed consent laws.

00:10:53.559 --> 00:10:57.900
But then the Court flip flopped in 2016,

00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:01.550
in June of 2016 in Whole Woman's
Health versus Hellerstedt.

00:11:01.550 --> 00:11:05.477
- [Melissa] The case makes
its way to the Supreme Court

00:11:05.477 --> 00:11:07.620
and in an opinion that's authored

00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:10.050
by Justice Stephen Breyer
and it's only an eight

00:11:10.050 --> 00:11:13.170
person Court because
Justice Scalia passes away

00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:16.750
in February of 2016, so just
eight people on the Court.

00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:19.100
In this decision, it's a
five to three decision,

00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:23.090
Justice Stephen Breyer
notes that the provisions

00:11:23.090 --> 00:11:25.280
that were challenged do not offer

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:27.960
the medical benefits that
they claimed to offer,

00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:31.240
sufficient to justify
the burdens on access

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:33.410
that each of those provisions imposes.

00:11:33.410 --> 00:11:36.460
- [Kim] What do you see as
the future of Roe versus Wade?

00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:37.450
- [Clarke] Well, the Court has failed

00:11:37.450 --> 00:11:39.460
as the national abortion control board.

00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:42.490
It can not monitor abortion.

00:11:42.490 --> 00:11:45.570
It can't intervene, it can't regulate

00:11:45.570 --> 00:11:48.100
or legislate itself, it can't act

00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:49.748
as public health administrators

00:11:49.748 --> 00:11:54.748
It can't investigate and
I believe it's absolutely

00:11:56.050 --> 00:11:57.890
certain that the Court, sooner or later,

00:11:57.890 --> 00:12:01.370
will have to overturn the
Roe versus Wade decision

00:12:01.370 --> 00:12:03.340
because of this failure
and return the issue

00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:04.320
to the states.

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:06.600
- [Melissa] When we are
talking about repealing

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:10.300
or reforming these laws
in the 1960s and 70s,

00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:12.610
it's also around a social movement

00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:14.690
where one of the critical questions is,

00:12:14.690 --> 00:12:17.550
what will be the role of women going forth

00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:19.460
in a modern society.

00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:21.520
When the questions of contraception

00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:23.360
come before the Court,
one of the questions is

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:25.219
whether women will be allowed to choose

00:12:25.219 --> 00:12:27.610
when and how to have
children, whether they can

00:12:27.610 --> 00:12:31.107
space the timing of births
to accommodate careers.

00:12:31.107 --> 00:12:34.000
It's the same issue that
comes up in abortion,

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.260
like this allowing
women freedom to be able

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:38.940
to go into the workforce, to determine

00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:40.690
when and how they will become mothers.

00:12:40.690 --> 00:12:44.640
And so, it's not surprising
that the same questions

00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:46.930
that arose in 19th century about the place

00:12:46.930 --> 00:12:49.190
of women, about what happens in a society

00:12:49.190 --> 00:12:51.850
that's undergoing change,
whether its immigration

00:12:51.850 --> 00:12:54.480
or changes in the
demography of the country,

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:57.590
are also coming up in the 1960s and 1970s

00:12:57.590 --> 00:12:59.289
at a time of incredible social change.

00:12:59.289 --> 00:13:02.970
And I think abortion and
these rights involving

00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:05.240
a woman's role really do come to the fore

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:06.970
and are incredibly controversial.

00:13:06.970 --> 00:13:08.910
- [Kim] So we've learned that the decision

00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:11.770
to legalize abortion in Roe versus Wade

00:13:11.770 --> 00:13:13.830
was based on the right of privacy,

00:13:13.830 --> 00:13:16.630
which the court has inferred
from the due process

00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:18.490
clause of the 14th amendment.

00:13:18.490 --> 00:13:21.270
Since the Roe decision,
a number of other cases

00:13:21.270 --> 00:13:24.150
have set limits on abortion
and abortion clinics.

00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:26.670
Clarke Forsythe argues
that the Supreme Court

00:13:26.670 --> 00:13:28.670
has failed in regulating abortion

00:13:28.670 --> 00:13:31.050
and that the issue should
be returned to the states.

00:13:31.050 --> 00:13:33.421
Melissa Murray, by contrast, suggests

00:13:33.421 --> 00:13:36.660
that the decision in Roe
is crucial to giving women

00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:38.390
the freedom to join the workforce

00:13:38.390 --> 00:13:40.620
and make decisions about
when to have children.

00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:42.320
