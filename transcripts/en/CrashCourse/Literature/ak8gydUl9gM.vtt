00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.120
Hi, I’m John Green, this is Crash Course
Literature,

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:06.820
and today we’re going to continue our discussion of Mark Twain’s “The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.”

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:11.200
But this time we get to talk about metaphors,
and the book’s extremely unpopular ending.

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:15.169
So as Sigmund Freud probably never actually
said, “sometimes a cigar is just a cigar,”

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:21.220
but in Huckleberry Finn, the raft, the island, the river, they aren’t just rafts and islands and rivers.

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:29.940
[Theme Music]

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:33.640
So, I think the most significant metaphor
in the book is the Mississippi river itself.

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.460
It was a river Twain knew well; he worked
in his youth as a steamboat pilot.

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:43.000
And he communicates some of the beauty and the wonder of that river in a passage where he describes the approach of dawn:

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.320
“Not a sound anywheres
- perfectly still -

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.940
just like the whole world was asleep, only
sometimes the bullfrogs a-clattering, maybe.

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:54.840
The first thing to see, looking away over
the water, was a kind of dull line -

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.100
that was the woods on t'other side - you couldn't make nothing else out; then a pale place in the sky;

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:03.350
then more paleness, spreading around and you
see the mist curl up off of the water,

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.340
and the east reddens up, and the river.”

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:10.060
I mean, you read that, and you think, hey, I want to escape my alcoholic, abusive father and travel down the river, too!

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.850
The sense of serenity, of possibility, of
benevolent nature is almost overwhelming.

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:20.170
The river is seen to be in contrast with a lot of the violence and pettiness that Huck finds on land.

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.900
That’s what some early critics noted, like
Lionel Trilling and T.S. Eliot.

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.860
They argued that while the book doesn’t have a lot of time for conventional religious belief,

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.270
it does make kind of a god of the river.

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.840
“It is about a god,” Trilling wrote, “a power which seems to have a mind and a will of its own,

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:40.020
and which, to men of moral imagination, appears
to embody a great moral idea.”

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:46.440
He argued that while this god of the river isn't necessarily good, love of it leads Huck toward goodness,

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:51.560
which you can see in the way Huck’s voice is at its most beautiful and poetic when he’s describing the river.

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.320
But some later critics have argued that this
view is maybe too rose-colored and limiting.

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:01.020
Like, the river is a beautiful place in Huck Finn, but also a dangerous one, which Trilling only sort of acknowledges.

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.900
I mean, it's a place where dead bodies float
by,

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:08.840
where a sudden fog separates the two friends, where a steamboat threatens to destroy the raft.

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.620
But to that, I’d point out that gods aren’t
necessarily nice, as much as they’re powerful.

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:19.600
And there’s also been a lot of scholarship around the idea that the river represents a great moral idea: Freedom.

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.620
Like, early in the book, he says, “In two
seconds away we went a-sliding down the river,

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:29.200
and it did seem so good to be free again and all by ourselves on the big river, and nobody to bother us.”

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.940
And throughout the book, there’s a strong opposition between life on the river and life onshore,

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.800
where there are a bunch of nonsensical rules, and uncivilized civilizations, and absurd feuds.

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.890
But that opposition is also an oversimplification
in the end, isn’t it?

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.879
Because the river is often a threat to the
freedom that Huck and Jim want.

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.140
I mean, Jim escapes in the first place because he's learned he’s about to be sold “down the river.”

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.590
I mean, it's the river that sends bounty
hunters past them.

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:58.250
That sticks them with two of the worst specimens of humanity ever known: the con men known as the King and the Duke.

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:04.420
It’s the river that pushes them right past Cairo, where they were hoping to catch a steamboat up to the free states,

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.019
and transports them deeper into slave territory.

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:10.161
So, if we’re gonna see the river as a god,
and I think it’s helpful to,

00:03:10.161 --> 00:03:15.160
let’s see it as, like, one of the gods of Mount Olympus, a complicated, quasi-human god.

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.700
Mr. Green, Mr. Green, I’m sorry, but you’re
always ruining books by overreading them.

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.120
Like, why does the river have to be a god?
Why can’t it just be a river?

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.040
A little late in the game for you to be rearing
your head me from the past, but OK.

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.709
I would argue that you’re going to worship
something.

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:30.300
Maybe it’ll be a god, maybe it’ll be money,
or power, or fame,

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:34.970
but there’s going to be something that orients
your humanness in a particular direction.

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:40.330
I think Twain is arguing against the pro-slavery,
quote unquote, civilized god of the widow.

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:45.430
And arguing that love of this huge, intimidating,
beautiful river is a better way to worship.

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.180
So I do think it matters whether you see it just as a river, because you’re going to worship something.

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:50.870
All right, that’s the end of my rant.

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:55.530
Let’s move on to the raft, which a lot of critics also romanticize and Huck does too, like when he says,

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.830
“We said there warn't no home like a raft,
after all.

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:01.650
Other places do seem so cramped up and smothery,
but a raft don't.

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.830
You feel mighty free and easy and comfortable
on a raft.”

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:07.060
Or when he says, “It’s lovely to live
on a raft.

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:12.060
We had the sky up there, all speckled with stars, and we used to lay on our backs and look up at them,

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:14.840
and discuss about whether they was made or
only just happened.”

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.639
I just don’t think that living on a raft
would be like that at all.

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:22.049
I mean, one of the things I love most about
sleeping in a bed is that when I roll over,

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:24.289
I do not fall into the Mississippi River.

00:04:24.289 --> 00:04:27.900
So again the raft seems to represent a kind
of freedom, but on the other hand,

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:33.000
the raft gets them off the island at the beginning
of the book, and the island is kind of a paradise.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.480
I mean, when they’re on the island.

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:39.120
Huck even says to Jim, “I wouldn’t want to be nowhere else but here” So take that raft and river!

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.240
But of course, there’s also a problem with
the island, which is that it’s too close

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:43.940
to the past they’re trying to escape.

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:45.580
This is often what Twain does.

00:04:45.589 --> 00:04:49.279
I mean, he was a satirist and an ironist,
and so there wasn’t much he held sacred,

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:53.819
so if he showed something in a positive light, he was usually very aware of the negatives, too.

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:57.600
So they do feel great freedom on the raft, but in some ways, of course, it restricts freedom.

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:59.129
I mean, it sends them south.

00:04:59.129 --> 00:05:02.849
If there’s real freedom to be found in the book, it’s not going to be in a raft or on a river.

00:05:02.849 --> 00:05:07.889
It’s going to be inside the characters,
in a changed moral sense and a new idea of

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:11.639
what true freedom, and loyalty, and friendship
really mean.

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:15.659
And that is what makes the ending of the book
so confounding to many critics,

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:21.340
because the ending seems to go against a lot of the great stuff that the novel has already established.

00:05:21.349 --> 00:05:22.960
OK, let’s Go To the Thought Bubble.

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:26.360
So, Huck escapes the King and Duke only to
learn that they have sold Jim away

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:30.779
and that Jim is being held on the Phelps farm
until his owner can claim him.

00:05:30.779 --> 00:05:34.610
So he goes to the Phelps farm where is very
conveniently mistaken for Tom Sawyer,

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:36.779
who was scheduled to arrive for a visit.

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:42.060
When Tom does arrive, pretending to be his brother Sid, he and Huck discuss plans to free Jim.

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:46.499
Huck comes up with a simple no-nonsense scheme
– steal the key and sneak Jim out.

00:05:46.499 --> 00:05:48.909
But Tom wants a plan that’s a lot more elaborate,

00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:52.129
that borrows from every adventure and romance
novel he’s ever read.

00:05:52.129 --> 00:05:53.929
Now Twain was no big fan of romance.

00:05:53.929 --> 00:05:57.099
“Huckleberry Finn" is one of the first proper
attempts at American realism

00:05:57.099 --> 00:05:59.789
and he names a wrecked steamboat the Walter
Scott,

00:05:59.789 --> 00:06:03.999
just to show what he thinks of Ivanhoe and
all those lords and ladies and unlikely coincidences.

00:06:03.999 --> 00:06:08.020
You know, like Tom Sawyer being previously
scheduled to visit a random farm?

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:11.659
But even if Twain is obviously satirizing
Tom and his harebrained schemes,

00:06:11.659 --> 00:06:17.089
there’s no ignoring the fact that these
schemes hurt Jim, both physically and emotionally,

00:06:17.089 --> 00:06:21.270
though he endures them all with a willingness
that is actually pretty heartbreaking.

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:26.360
He lets the boys put snakes and rats and spiders into the hut where he is held and when the rats bite him,

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:30.400
he writes messages in his own blood on a shirt
that Tom provides.

00:06:30.409 --> 00:06:34.210
Jim can’t actually write, but he scrawls
on the shirt just to please Tom.

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:38.279
Then Tom gets the bright idea to announce
the escape plan in a series of anonymous letters,

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:43.040
which complicates things even more and gets Tom shot in the leg while running away with Jim.

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:47.340
And Jim jeopardizes his freedom to get a doctor
for Tom and is captured again,

00:06:47.349 --> 00:06:50.629
only to have Tom announce that Jim has been
free all this time.

00:06:50.629 --> 00:06:52.339
His mistress freed him on her deathbed.

00:06:52.339 --> 00:06:58.119
So everything Tom put him through, with Huck’s
agreement, was just for show. Just for fun.

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:01.980
Thanks, Thought Bubble. So, of course, that’s a pretty messed up idea of fun.

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:05.919
And yes, the ending ties up the loose ends
of the plot pretty neatly and it restores

00:07:05.919 --> 00:07:08.709
to the book some of the feel of “Adventures
of Tom Sawyer.”

00:07:08.709 --> 00:07:11.729
But as previously noted: Tom Sawyer isn’t
that great of a book.

00:07:11.729 --> 00:07:15.329
So going back to its tone isn’t necessarily
a great call.

00:07:15.329 --> 00:07:18.080
Huck has matured tremendously over the course
of this journey,

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:23.240
and he’s developed a relationship with Jim
that relies on mutual affection and mutual trust.

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:26.789
And while Huck takes a dim view of most people
– he tricks them, he lies to them –

00:07:26.789 --> 00:07:31.549
he comes to believe that cruelty is unworthy of him and that he doesn’t want others to suffer.

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:35.419
Like, when the Duke and the King, men who
have abused Huck and sold Jim away,

00:07:35.419 --> 00:07:39.879
are finally caught and tarred and feathered,
we might expect Huck to be happy, but he isn’t.

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:44.840
“Well, it made me sick to see it,” he says,
“and I was sorry for them poor pitiful rascals,

00:07:44.849 --> 00:07:48.729
it seemed like I couldn’t ever feel any
hardness against them any more in the world…

00:07:48.729 --> 00:07:51.240
Human beings CAN be awful cruel to one another.”

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:56.060
But if he’s able to summon that kind of sympathy for his enemies, if he doesn’t feel any hardness toward them,

00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:58.440
how can he allow the cruelty to Jim?

00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:02.140
How can he let himself be reduced to the role
of Tom’s sidekick again?

00:08:02.149 --> 00:08:04.969
And how can Twain encourage Jim to bear it
all so complacently?

00:08:04.969 --> 00:08:09.219
I don’t have good answers to those questions,
although some of it may lie in Huck’s upbringing.

00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:14.560
Huck is very conscious of having not been raised in respectable circumstances and he believes that Tom

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:17.730
– with all of his reading and all of his
education – must know better.

00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:21.640
In fact, he can barely get it through his
head that a boy as educated and civilized

00:08:21.649 --> 00:08:24.809
as Tom would consent to help free a runaway
slave.

00:08:24.809 --> 00:08:29.589
Now, of course Tom knows that Jim is free
all the time, so he's not taking a moral risk.

00:08:29.589 --> 00:08:34.169
But even so, for many readers, this ending
sequence is a betrayal of what has come before.

00:08:34.169 --> 00:08:39.160
I mean, out on the river, when they weren’t being threatened by steamboats or menaced by con men,

00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:43.680
Huck and Jim could almost believe that a new
and better world was possible.

00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:47.329
They could even look up at the stars and wonder
if they were made or just happened,

00:08:47.329 --> 00:08:49.889
which is a pretty sacreligious thing to wonder.

00:08:49.889 --> 00:08:54.180
But on the Phelps farm the story falls back
into stereotype and caricature,

00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:58.990
and to return to the boys’ adventure mood
of the beginning is a kind of defeat.

00:08:58.990 --> 00:09:02.269
It's giving up on what Huck and Jim have forged
on the river.

00:09:02.269 --> 00:09:05.009
Why did Twain do this?
Could he not think of a better ending?

00:09:05.009 --> 00:09:12.459
Or had he seen too much of how racial injustice continued even after the Civil War to believe that Huck and Jim could escape its indignities?

00:09:12.459 --> 00:09:15.310
Therin lies my half-hearted defense of the
ending.

00:09:15.310 --> 00:09:18.970
It’s a big pivot from the rest of the novel,
but it might be an honest one.

00:09:18.970 --> 00:09:25.040
Two friends on a river can accomplish a lot, but they cannot escape the deep systemic racism in America.

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:29.540
We get a taste of this when Jim risks his
freedom to save Tom, and Huck says approvingly,

00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:31.329
“I knowed he was white inside."

00:09:31.329 --> 00:09:34.500
Huck means that Jim is brave and honorable
and loyal,

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:38.960
but those are qualities that most of the white people he has met throughout the book have not exhibited.

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:46.320
But the fact that he uses “white” as a mark of approval shows that neither Huck nor Jim has become somehow magically free from racism.

00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:51.340
And so in the end, the book concludes, not
comically or tragically, but on a note of uncertainty,

00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:56.060
as Huck realizes that he’ll have to leave again, have to seek out a new place in which to feel at home.

00:09:56.060 --> 00:09:59.560
“I reckon I got to light out for the territory
ahead of the rest,” he says,

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:04.360
“because Aunt Sally says she’s going to adopt me and sivilize me, and I can’t stand it. I been there before.”

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:06.939
We can only hope for Huck,
as for America,

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:13.360
that his time on the river becomes part of a much larger journey toward acceptance and understanding and compassion.

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:15.720
Safe travels, Huck.
Godspeed.
