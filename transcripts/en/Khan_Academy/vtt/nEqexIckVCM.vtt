00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.106
- [Voiceover] I am about to do something

00:00:02.106 --> 00:00:04.927
that most of you will
probably find disconcerting,

00:00:04.927 --> 00:00:07.307
in fact, the first time
that I saw someone do this,

00:00:07.307 --> 00:00:10.081
I too found it disconcerting.

00:00:10.081 --> 00:00:12.101
So, just as a little bit of background,

00:00:12.101 --> 00:00:13.599
so far, when we've been thinking about

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:15.688
our space axis, and we've really just been

00:00:15.688 --> 00:00:17.488
focusing on one dimension of space,

00:00:17.488 --> 00:00:19.484
we've been focusing on the x dimension,

00:00:19.484 --> 00:00:21.400
or the x prime dimension, depending on

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.929
whose frame of reference
we are talking about.

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:27.483
We measured that in terms of meters.

00:00:27.483 --> 00:00:29.166
We measured that in terms of meters,

00:00:29.166 --> 00:00:30.699
and then when we thought about time,

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:32.939
well, we said, initially,
we said, "Well, time is

00:00:32.939 --> 00:00:34.959
"fundamentally something
different than space,"

00:00:34.959 --> 00:00:37.304
so we had a different set
of units called seconds,

00:00:37.304 --> 00:00:39.440
in fact, you know, this
goes well before we,

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.681
well before the 20th century when we got

00:00:41.681 --> 00:00:43.979
special relativity, this
goes all the way back to well

00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:46.905
before even that, where we said
time is something different.

00:00:46.905 --> 00:00:49.508
We measure it in units
of time, in seconds,

00:00:49.508 --> 00:00:51.669
or minutes, or hours, or days.

00:00:51.669 --> 00:00:53.219
While distance, which
is different than time,

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.466
we measured in meters, or feet, or miles,

00:00:55.466 --> 00:00:58.686
or kilometers, or whatever else.

00:00:58.686 --> 00:01:00.975
But as we started to
get into this world of

00:01:00.975 --> 00:01:04.572
special relativity and
we started to see that

00:01:04.572 --> 00:01:07.662
space and time are not each absolute.

00:01:07.662 --> 00:01:10.576
And, in fact, we can
actually think of all events

00:01:10.576 --> 00:01:14.314
as happening in this
continuum called spacetime.

00:01:14.314 --> 00:01:16.043
And I say it fast, "spacetime".

00:01:16.043 --> 00:01:18.683
Because it's not saying "space-time".

00:01:18.683 --> 00:01:20.118
Two different things.

00:01:20.118 --> 00:01:22.277
It's saying that they're really
just different directions

00:01:22.277 --> 00:01:24.483
in this continuum spacetime.

00:01:24.483 --> 00:01:26.759
And so, if they are all
the same thing why do we

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.473
use different units for space and time?

00:01:30.473 --> 00:01:33.863
Why do we use seconds for
time and meters for space?

00:01:33.863 --> 00:01:37.323
Or at least in the examples
that I've been doing so far.

00:01:37.323 --> 00:01:39.459
And so to fix that,
instead of calling this

00:01:39.459 --> 00:01:43.139
the "t-prime axis" or the "t
axis," instead of labeling

00:01:43.139 --> 00:01:45.519
it in terms of seconds, what we can do

00:01:45.519 --> 00:01:47.074
and this is the part that many of you

00:01:47.074 --> 00:01:49.698
will find disconcerting, let's call this

00:01:49.698 --> 00:01:52.171
the "c times t-prime axis."

00:01:52.171 --> 00:01:55.096
And let's call this the "c times t axis."

00:01:55.096 --> 00:01:58.114
And the "c times t-prime axis."

00:01:58.114 --> 00:01:59.600
Well, what's that going to do?

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.841
Well, we know that the speed
of light is an absolute.

00:02:01.841 --> 00:02:04.012
It is, if we are measuring it in,

00:02:04.012 --> 00:02:05.746
and I'll do approximately
because it's actually

00:02:05.746 --> 00:02:07.355
two point nine something.

00:02:07.355 --> 00:02:10.320
But, approximately three
times 10 to the 8th

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:11.260
meters per second.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.158
For the sake of all of these
videos I'm just assuming

00:02:13.158 --> 00:02:14.820
it's three times ten to
the 8th meters per second.

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.374
For simplicity it's roughly that.

00:02:17.374 --> 00:02:19.672
So if we were to take c times time

00:02:19.672 --> 00:02:22.958
instead of this being one
second, in terms of seconds,

00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:24.426
well, we multiply it times

00:02:24.426 --> 00:02:26.916
three times ten to the
8th meters per second.

00:02:26.916 --> 00:02:29.029
Well, the seconds cancel
out and we're left...

00:02:29.029 --> 00:02:31.897
If we want to measure
time in terms of meters,

00:02:31.897 --> 00:02:35.077
would be three times
ten to the 8th meters.

00:02:35.077 --> 00:02:38.600
So this is three times
ten to the 8th meters,

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.069
instead of calling it one second.

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:42.252
This over here is negative.

00:02:42.252 --> 00:02:43.737
So that over there is negative

00:02:43.737 --> 00:02:47.314
three times ten to the 8th meters.

00:02:47.314 --> 00:02:50.506
Along the "c t-prime axis."

00:02:50.506 --> 00:02:53.350
Likewise, this what we called one second,

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:55.916
right over here, instead
we can call this as

00:02:55.916 --> 00:02:59.375
three times ten to the 8th meters.

00:02:59.375 --> 00:03:01.764
This we could call negative

00:03:01.764 --> 00:03:04.774
three times ten to the 8th meters.

00:03:04.774 --> 00:03:07.165
Now this will be counterintuitive to you

00:03:07.165 --> 00:03:10.311
because you've always
viewed time as fundamentally

00:03:10.311 --> 00:03:11.669
something different than meters.

00:03:11.669 --> 00:03:14.165
You haven't been thinking
in terms of spacetime.

00:03:14.165 --> 00:03:16.974
In fact, in our normal human
experience we don't experience

00:03:16.974 --> 00:03:19.203
the world in terms of space time.

00:03:19.203 --> 00:03:21.223
Time is something that we
are just falling forward into

00:03:21.223 --> 00:03:24.810
and space is something that
we feel like we have more

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.109
agency and we can move in
the different dimensions

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:29.744
of space more easily, while
time just feels like we're

00:03:29.744 --> 00:03:32.786
plummeting forward in that dimension.

00:03:32.786 --> 00:03:34.725
But now we're thinking
in terms of spacetime

00:03:34.725 --> 00:03:37.046
and this makes our units the same.

00:03:37.046 --> 00:03:39.264
Now if it helps you,
you could view this as

00:03:39.264 --> 00:03:42.224
three times ten to the 8th light meters.

00:03:42.224 --> 00:03:44.848
So you could think of this
as the time it would take

00:03:44.848 --> 00:03:48.342
for light to go three times
ten to the 8th meters.

00:03:48.342 --> 00:03:50.687
Likewise, if we wanted
everything in terms of what

00:03:50.687 --> 00:03:53.508
we traditionally conceive
of as our time dimensions,

00:03:53.508 --> 00:03:55.923
we could have kept this as one second,

00:03:55.923 --> 00:03:58.212
instead of calling this three
times ten to the 8th meters

00:03:58.212 --> 00:04:00.449
we could have called
this one light second,

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:02.678
which would be the
distance that light travels

00:04:02.678 --> 00:04:07.058
in what we measure, or what
we consider to be one second.

00:04:07.058 --> 00:04:09.842
But the benefit of this
is now we're consistent.

00:04:09.842 --> 00:04:12.640
We're measuring different
directions in spacetime,

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.521
which is kind of a continuum,

00:04:14.521 --> 00:04:16.888
there is no separate time and space.

00:04:16.888 --> 00:04:19.547
We're measuring them
all in the same units,

00:04:19.547 --> 00:04:22.600
which we will find is
very, very convenient.

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.481
So, I know this is going to
take a little bit of time

00:04:24.481 --> 00:04:26.698
to get your head around,
and I'll maybe do a few

00:04:26.698 --> 00:04:28.822
more videos to make you
feel comfortable with

00:04:28.822 --> 00:04:31.888
this type of idea, but this will be a

00:04:31.888 --> 00:04:32.908
convenient thing for us.

00:04:35.158 --> 00:04:39.921
Especially as we start
to have a metric in our,

00:04:40.551 --> 00:04:44.320
what we would call, our
Minkowski spacetime.

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.215
Because we are going to be
operating in the different

00:04:46.215 --> 00:04:49.417
dimensions as if they have the same units.

00:04:49.417 --> 00:04:52.226
So, hopefully, I encouraged
you to kind of sit and ponder

00:04:52.226 --> 00:04:53.944
and think about this a little bit,

00:04:53.944 --> 00:04:56.690
and hopefully it doesn't
bother you too much.
