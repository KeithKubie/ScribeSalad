00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:09.060
In May 2018, NASA launched the next mission
to Mars.

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:15.369
An Atlas 5 rocket took off from the Vandenberg
Air Force base in California; the very first

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:17.870
interplanetary launch from the West Coast.

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:22.480
Aboard the rocket are two cubesats, which
are the first of their kind for a Mars mission,

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.440
and a robotic lander.

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:25.440
The goal?

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:34.989
Touch down successfully and investigate the
deep interior

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:35.989
of Mars.

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:38.470
Over the decades, there have been a series
of critical missions to the red planet.

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:43.840
Flybys that took our first snapshots of Mars,
landers that characterized its atmosphere,

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.870
orbiters that studied its geology and climate,
and rovers that are investigating the presence

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.420
of liquid water.

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:55.760
The next phase is the Interior Exploration
using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.800
Heat Transport or InSight.

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.019
Everybody has seen pictures of what the inside
of the Earth looks like - you see the core,

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.690
and the inner core.

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:09.380
We make pictures like that for Mars, but it's
just guessing.

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.369
This is the first time we're actually going
to know what the inside of Mars looks like.

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:19.420
We're using three processes: Seismometer,
Heat Flow, and Precision tracking.

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.620
The lander is outfitted with a suite of sophisticated
instruments, each with their own research

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:25.409
goal and acronym.

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.890
The seismic instrument is called SEIS.

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.850
That's Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure
that's going to be listening for marsquakes.

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.950
This seismometer is very, very sensitive.

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.740
If a butterfly lands on it and flaps its wing
it's going to detect it.

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.100
On Earth, most of the earthquakes we see are
driven by plate tectonics.

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.159
We don't expect to see that on Mars.

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:53.439
The seismology lets us look at how active
the surface of the planet is.

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:58.280
We can look at the way the waves vibrate,
which direction they vibrate, and we can use

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.479
that to determine which direction the quake
came from.

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:05.979
Next up is the Heat Flow and Physical Properties
Probe or HP3.

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:11.230
One of the biggest things that we need to
understand when we look at how planets evolve

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.870
is understanding what is happening with heat.

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.920
Most planets, you can think of them as heat
engines.

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.180
Everything they do involves how heat starts
out inside the planet and gets out.

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.320
We have what we call a heat probe that we're
going to dig deep into Mars.

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:30.099
That lets us know how Mars is evolving, how
it is changing over time, how it has held

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:35.480
on to the heat we can predict it had early
on in its history, and how much heat it has

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.959
now.

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:45.060
There's also the Rotation and Interior Structure
Experiment, or RISE, a precision radio science

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.120
instrument that’ll track the position of
the lander and help determine Mars’s core

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.280
is made of.

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.400
All of these instruments will be placed on
the planet with a 2.4 meter long robotic arm

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:01.200
that has four degree of freedom, a grapple,
a camera, and a second camera mounted underneath

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.200
the lander.

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.590
This is the first time we are going to do
position placement on Mars where we take an

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.060
instrument and install it on Mars and it's
going to be it's final resting place.

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:14.549
And we're doing all of this hundreds of millions
of miles away, blindfolded literally.

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:19.620
Right now, the InSight spacecraft is on a
six month cruise to Mars, tracked by NASA’s

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:20.739
Deep Space Network.

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:24.909
It’s tucked away inside an aerodynamic shell
and protective heat shield.

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:28.939
Once it reaches the point of descent, NASA
engineers will prepare for the difficult,

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:35.519
nail biting endeavor of landing Insight on
Mars, otherwise known as seven minutes of

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:37.239
terror.

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:40.530
Insight is not going to use the sky crane
technology to land on Mars.

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.980
It's going to have a parachute to slow it
down and to land with its retro rockets.

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:50.469
It’ll touch down in the Elysium Planitia,
about 373 miles from where Curiosity hangs

00:03:50.469 --> 00:03:51.469
out.

00:03:51.469 --> 00:03:53.470
It had to be close to the equator.

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:58.791
That's because this mission is solar powered,
and it needs to be powered all the time so

00:03:58.791 --> 00:04:01.349
that the seismometer can always be running.

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:06.769
We still have no idea how our planets formed,
and by taking the vital signs of Mars, the

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:09.450
InSight mission will help us begin to understand
that.

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.519
This is pure exploration in a lot of ways.

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:12.829
We don't know these answers.

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:32.150
We have estimations, but it's going to surprise
us.

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:35.860
