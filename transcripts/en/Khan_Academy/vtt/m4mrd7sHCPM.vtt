00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:04.050
If we want to get the upside
of owning a stock while still

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:07.640
mitigating the downside, in
case the stock price goes down,

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:12.210
we saw that we could buy a stock
and an appropriate put option.

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.940
So that when the stock
goes below some price,

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.640
the put option
starts to have value,

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.300
and so it mitigates
our downside.

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.080
And just as a review,
these payoff diagrams

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.300
are the values of-- or at
least the one on the left,

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.930
is the value of our holdings
at some future date.

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:28.610
And we're defining that
date to be the maturity

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:31.940
date of the options
under question.

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.810
Now, and this one over here
is the profit at that maturity

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:37.110
date, and that's why we're
subtracting the actual costs

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.620
to enter the position on
this one on the right.

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.730
Now the question I want to
answer in this video is how can

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:46.940
we get the same payoff diagram
without buying either stocks

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:47.910
or puts?

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.580
And as a bit of a
clue, think about what

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:52.250
happens if we were to
just to buy a call option.

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:53.990
Actually let me do it
in that same color.

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:55.970
So if you were to just
have a call option,

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:58.230
the payoff diagram
would look like this.

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.682
You would never exercise the
call option at expiration,

00:01:01.682 --> 00:01:03.140
unless-- and we're
assuming this is

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.170
at expiration or at maturity.

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.300
But if the stock
price goes above $50,

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:12.460
you would then exercise your
option to buy it at $50.

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.090
So then it starts to
have value as the stock

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.440
price goes above $50.

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.420
If the stock price
goes to $60, you

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.540
would exercise your
option to buy at $50,

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.140
and then you could sell at
$60 and you would make $10.

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.230
So you start to get
some of the upside.

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:29.330
So how can we
shift this graph up

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.790
to get exactly the
same payoff diagram?

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.760
Well, we could
have a call option,

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.330
and we could own something
that would essentially

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.400
shift this entire
graph up by $50.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.670
So we could have, essentially,
a $50 bond, or a bond

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.100
to that is worth-- let
me write it this way.

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:57.950
A bond that is worth $50
at option expiration.

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:59.899
So if there's some
interest we're getting,

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:01.940
we might be able to buy
it for a little bit less.

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.870
If there's zero interest, then
it's pretty much like cash,

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:06.420
we would pay $50 for it.

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.479
But the payoff diagram for a
bond that will be worth $50

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.010
at this date, at maturity,
or at expiration, the payoff

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.000
diagram for just the bond
would look like this.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.374
It would just be
a straight line.

00:02:17.374 --> 00:02:20.430
It's guaranteed to pay you $50.

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.720
So if you own the bond and
the call option, below $50,

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.620
the call option is
worthless, so you're just

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.020
going to have the
bond over here.

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.330
And then above $50, you
still have the bond,

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.259
but now the call option
is worth something.

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:37.550
So you have the value of the
bond plus the call option.

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:40.790
So at $60, the call option's
worth $10, the bonds worth $50,

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.007
the combination is worth $60.

00:02:43.007 --> 00:02:45.340
And so the combination of the
call option plus the bond,

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.150
you'll see it here
on the left, it's

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.230
actually going to
have the same payoff

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.410
diagram as the
stock plus the put.

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.460
So you have the situation
here that a stock

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:58.740
plus an appropriately
priced put or a put

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:00.470
with a appropriate
strike price is

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:02.440
going to be the same
thing when it comes

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.480
to payoff, at a future
date, at expiration,

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.260
as a bond plus a call option.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.310
And this right here is
called put call parity.

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.560
And it shows the
relationship between all

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:16.870
of these different securities.

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.920
And if any of the prices
start to kind of not

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.370
make this thing hold
true, there might

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.160
be an arbitrage opportunity.

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.991
But we'll cover that
in future videos.
