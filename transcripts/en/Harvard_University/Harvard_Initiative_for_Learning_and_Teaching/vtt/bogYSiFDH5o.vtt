00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.920
OK.

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:06.220
So hi.

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:07.000
I'm Brittany Butler.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.125
I'm the Executive Director
of the Social Innovation

00:00:09.125 --> 00:00:12.340
and Change initiative, which
is a relatively new initiative,

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:14.350
almost two years old,
at the Kennedy School

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:16.210
and an adjunct lecturer there.

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:20.740
I'm representing our
team, the SICI team,

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:22.720
as well as my colleague
Julie Battilana,

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.350
who is a professor
at both HBS and HKS.

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:30.310
So I have to say we're
maybe the team that

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:32.420
joined this group the
latest and thus got

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:35.200
to benefit on riding the
coattails of the ethics group,

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.650
of the search tool, of the
fact that there will very soon

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:42.684
now be this syllabus
search tool because that's

00:00:42.684 --> 00:00:43.600
sort of our next step.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.765
And so thank you, actually,
to HILT for involving us.

00:00:47.765 --> 00:00:49.390
So the mission of
the Social Innovation

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:51.056
and Change initiative
the Kennedy School

00:00:51.056 --> 00:00:53.290
is to generate new
knowledge, and also

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:54.760
to shape the practice
of innovation

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:55.660
with a social intent.

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:57.970
So not innovation to
make a profit and not

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:00.190
innovation for its
own sake, but to solve

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:01.570
a specific social problem.

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.110
And we entered into
this work essentially

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:07.120
because anecdotally,
the student demand

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.370
was just like blasting up.

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:11.860
So our team was immediately
overwhelmed by the number

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.070
of students coming in and asking
for advice about which courses

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.970
they should take, asking about
the I-lab, asking about HIVE,

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.130
asking about all the
competitions on campus

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.590
and how they should be
navigating those things.

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.230
So we entered with a set of
questions about the curriculum,

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:29.320
but also a set of
questions about

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.260
extracurricular activities
and how those overlapped.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.660
And the thing about social
innovation, unlike many

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:36.070
of the things that have
been described here--

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.020
but I think this is an
increasing trend also

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.470
in higher ed-- is it's
not actually a discipline.

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:46.000
At best, it's a phenomena
inside of certain disciplines.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.720
And yet year after year,
the interest from students

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:50.660
keeps rising.

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.710
And as we talk to students about
what they want and how they

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:55.960
want to make a difference
in the world, they say look,

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.090
there's this specific
social problem I care about.

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:59.470
And what's the
scope and sequence

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:00.845
that I should be
thinking through

00:02:00.845 --> 00:02:02.960
as I prepare myself to
go out there and do this?

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.890
And so we had terrible
answers for them.

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.110
And so like very
basic level, we just

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.680
wanted to know what
courses are being taught?

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.750
What out-of-class innovation
experiences are offered?

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.290
And how do the perceptions
and experiences and demand

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.270
from the students
and external actors

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.270
about what's available
actually compare to the supply?

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.850
I mean, we just didn't
know anything about this.

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:30.040
And so we are very
much in this stage

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.980
and looking to go deeper soon.

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.840
So again, this is
where we started.

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.100
So there was a report done
in 2013 that gave us some

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:44.320
indication that 36% of
cross-registration petition

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.210
across all the school--

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:48.280
so this is like a student
making an extra effort

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.490
to go into another school
because they perceive

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:53.560
that there's something
at another school that

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:54.970
isn't available in their own--

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.399
30% of those fall
into this category.

00:02:57.399 --> 00:02:59.440
And many of the students
who made those petitions

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:00.790
were denied.

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:02.850
So we know there's interest.

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:05.140
Just locally, again, the
anecdotes were there.

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.030
And then on the supply
side, very spotty.

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:09.521
But the challenge
for us also was

00:03:09.521 --> 00:03:11.020
it was difficult
to answer questions

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:12.100
for prospective students.

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.266
And at the Kennedy School
and at the business school

00:03:14.266 --> 00:03:15.940
in particular, we
were feeling the pain

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.523
of actually losing prospective
students because even though we

00:03:18.523 --> 00:03:20.770
had this intuition
that as a whole,

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:23.200
Harvard University offers
an incredible amount

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.750
on this front, we weren't
able to represent that well,

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.580
and that was scaring us.

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:30.809
And then at the same time the
students who were pursuing this

00:03:30.809 --> 00:03:33.100
stuff would say, look, I've
already taken--sort of that

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:34.756
first quote that
you started with.

00:03:34.756 --> 00:03:36.880
There's a lot of overlap
between these two classes,

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.463
and I really wish someone could
have given me a heads up about

00:03:39.463 --> 00:03:42.220
that because I don't feel like
I'm optimizing my time here.

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:43.430
That's how we started.

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.556
But as we move forward,
some additional questions

00:03:45.556 --> 00:03:46.930
surface that,
again, I think, are

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:48.640
important as folks
particularly think

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.700
about multi-disciplinary
initiatives, or initiatives

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.630
that aren't clearly
in a discipline,

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.690
but where student
demand is high,

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:01.540
which is what is Harvard's
responsibility to get clear

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:03.680
about this stuff given
that social innovation,

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.040
social change aren't traditional
academic disciplines.

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.130
And that's an open
question, but it's something

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:12.755
that increasingly every year
feels like we need an answer.

00:04:12.755 --> 00:04:14.380
And what can and
should be accomplished

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:16.579
through the curricular
versus the co-curricular?

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:19.029
So the Social Innovation
and Change initiative

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:20.500
actually runs a
fellowship program.

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.920
It's a co-curricular program for
15 select students every year

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:26.649
who are working on advancing
a project that they plan

00:04:26.649 --> 00:04:27.940
to continue when they graduate.

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:30.730
They can get up to $30,000
to advance those projects

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:32.050
when they finish.

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:34.600
But is that the only
experience that they should

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.574
be getting here in the school?

00:04:36.574 --> 00:04:37.990
And how does that
relate to what's

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:39.020
happening in the classroom?

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:40.330
So very much along
the lines of what's

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:41.705
going on with the
research stuff,

00:04:41.705 --> 00:04:43.960
and how much is that
shaping students' experience

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.439
here is something we want
to understand better.

00:04:46.439 --> 00:04:48.230
And then what opportunities
are we missing?

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:50.605
And it just seems like there's
a lot of low hanging fruit

00:04:50.605 --> 00:04:53.230
that we don't really
understand yet.

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:55.390
So this is just a
quick sense of how

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:59.200
we approached putting our
arms around this space

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:02.020
and even just defining
what we're talking about.

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:05.150
Lucas, you spent a
lot of time on this.

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:06.000
So just a sample.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.110
This is just a sample.

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:10.620
There are 521 uni courses,
so that's on the next slide.

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:12.644
But this is just a sample.

00:05:12.644 --> 00:05:13.560
And look at the range.

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:16.400
Innovators, practice, finding,
building, leading, good ideas.

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.210
Applied Music Activism.

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:20.910
Thermal Tectonics for
the Next Billion People.

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:23.970
Designing for the Just City.

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:26.250
Innovative Approaches
to Teacher Prep.

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:27.870
Innovation in Ministry.

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:30.480
These are all processes
that certainly

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:33.480
aren't 100% overlapping,
but where you can really

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:36.600
quickly come to understand
that you need to be

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.110
able to define the problem.

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:39.960
There's a set of
competencies here

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:42.270
that each of these
students needs to get.

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:45.090
You need to understand the
root causes of those problems.

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:48.360
You need to be able
to iterate and think

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:51.600
in an iterative learning way
about potential solutions

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:53.910
and make selections
about those solutions.

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:56.391
And you need to understand your
own role as a social change

00:05:56.391 --> 00:05:56.890
maker.

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:58.620
And so despite the
fact that they're

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:01.260
all across different
schools and potentially

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:04.559
different in many ways, there's
actually a lot of similarities.

00:06:04.559 --> 00:06:06.600
And that's what we wanted
to start to understand.

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:09.480
This is a set of key words.

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:12.450
We followed, again, on the
coattails of the ethics folks

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:14.130
and did this sort
of iterative process

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:16.744
of looking for key words
in the course descriptions.

00:06:16.744 --> 00:06:18.660
We would have loved to
been able to drill down

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:20.940
to the level of the
syllabi because we suspect

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:23.250
that when we talk about
the competencies required

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:24.750
to be an effective
social innovator,

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:28.170
it might be happening
at that syllabus level.

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:30.457
And when we get there
we will do that.

00:06:30.457 --> 00:06:32.040
But in the meantime,
it just gives you

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:36.550
a sense of the range of search
terms that came up for us,

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:39.780
and then we would feed
those back in to the system

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:43.200
until we came to this 521.

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:48.500
And so yeah, for next year, in
terms of what kind of resources

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:51.590
can we use to support students
and faculty in creating

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:53.420
a community and
finding their way,

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:56.590
we've been thinking about
a compendium of curricula.

00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:59.090
We think that just would be an
interesting contribution also

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:02.060
beyond Harvard, and that
that would then draw folks

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:04.592
into the conversation broadly.

00:07:04.592 --> 00:07:06.050
Oh, this is our
big takeaway, which

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:09.410
is that pretty much every single
school is offering courses

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:10.350
on this front.

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:12.050
And it's really pretty
well-distributed.

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:13.930
There's an Other group
here that represents

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:14.930
a couple of the schools.

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:17.900
But again, this, just like
Erin said about the other,

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:19.670
this is our first
cut at a snapshot.

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:23.190
We're still trying to figure
out even what the bounds are.

00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:27.470
And so a next step for us
will also be connecting with

00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:30.512
relevant faculty, faculty who
are interested in this work,

00:07:30.512 --> 00:07:32.720
particularly faculty who
have sort of an experiential

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:35.600
learning pedagogy-- they seem
to be very drawn to this--

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:38.450
and ask them for
reactions to the set

00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:40.566
of courses we've surfaced.

00:07:40.566 --> 00:07:42.440
And then eventually just
make recommendations

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:45.946
to improve the student pathway
for making social impact.

00:07:45.946 --> 00:07:48.320
Many of them come here and
say that's kind of why they're

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:50.130
getting an education now.

00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:53.000
And so how can we prepare
them to do that well?

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:53.750
And then hopes?

00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:57.230
Yeah, just that, again, the
multi-disciplinary learning

00:07:57.230 --> 00:08:01.220
journey in particular could be
a little easier for students.

00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:02.490
Right now we're very siloed.

00:08:02.490 --> 00:08:04.250
I think we all know that.

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:07.280
And they feel it the most.

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:09.260
And then creating a
connection between faculty

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.970
and students who would benefit
from working with each other.

00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:13.553
Even on this project,
I feel like I've

00:08:13.553 --> 00:08:15.590
connected with some
of you who might not

00:08:15.590 --> 00:08:17.782
have identified as falling
into social innovation.

00:08:17.782 --> 00:08:19.490
But when we get down
to the nitty-gritty,

00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:21.281
I think we're actually
grappling with a lot

00:08:21.281 --> 00:08:24.110
of similar questions.

00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:27.170
And this idea of
developing a one Harvard

00:08:27.170 --> 00:08:29.599
ecosystem, especially
when resources

00:08:29.599 --> 00:08:30.890
are distributed across schools.

00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:34.190
So the Kennedy School cannot
own social innovation,

00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:35.419
and we know that.

00:08:35.419 --> 00:08:37.610
But Harvard as a
whole really could

00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:40.700
be a dominant player in this
space if we could coordinate.

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:44.570
So there are certain topics
where no department, no school

00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:46.880
is going to be able to
really shape a field,

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:49.320
but together we might be
able to do quite a bit.

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:51.470
So that's where I'm at.
