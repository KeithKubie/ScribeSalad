TANESHIA RICE: Just Nesh.

00:00:02.668 --> 00:00:04.070
KEVIN HART: Chicago native.
- Yes

00:00:04.103 --> 00:00:05.671
What would the Chicago
people say about Just Nesh?

00:00:05.704 --> 00:00:06.773
Very honest.
KEVIN HART: OK.

00:00:06.806 --> 00:00:09.075
They always start
off with that.

00:00:09.108 --> 00:00:10.043
Very real.

00:00:10.076 --> 00:00:10.843
OK.

00:00:10.876 --> 00:00:11.911
- Semi-alcoholic.
- Semi--

00:00:11.944 --> 00:00:12.545
But--

00:00:12.578 --> 00:00:13.613
Semi.

00:00:13.646 --> 00:00:14.514
TANESHIA RICE: --I'm functional.

00:00:14.547 --> 00:00:15.415
Functional.

00:00:15.448 --> 00:00:16.949
Semi.

00:00:16.982 --> 00:00:19.419
I think I got voted one of
the top 5 drunkest comedians.

00:00:19.452 --> 00:00:20.353
Really?

00:00:20.386 --> 00:00:21.421
I didn't appreciate that.

00:00:21.454 --> 00:00:22.422
Really?
TANESHIA RICE: Yes!

00:00:22.455 --> 00:00:23.389
OK.
Well, congratulations.

00:00:23.422 --> 00:00:26.292
TANESHIA RICE: Thank you!

00:00:26.325 --> 00:00:28.728
That's a-- that's a big honor.

00:00:28.761 --> 00:00:30.363
What was it that happened
that you said, you know what?

00:00:30.396 --> 00:00:34.534
This is what I'm going to do
with my life, with my career.

00:00:34.567 --> 00:00:36.135
This is what I want.

00:00:36.168 --> 00:00:39.739
I think the feeling that I got
when I finally start doing it.

00:00:39.772 --> 00:00:41.374
I never even planned
on being a comedian.

00:00:41.407 --> 00:00:43.042
Did you poo?

00:00:43.075 --> 00:00:44.310
I probably burped
a little bit.

00:00:44.343 --> 00:00:47.246
You know, I was drunk.

00:00:47.279 --> 00:00:48.681
That's how I got on stage.

00:00:48.714 --> 00:00:50.683
Thank you, Grey
Goose, for my start.

00:00:50.716 --> 00:00:53.286
But no.

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:54.854
Yeah, I'd never planned
on being a comedian.

00:00:54.887 --> 00:00:57.523
My friend made me
go up one night

00:00:57.556 --> 00:00:58.991
because everybody was bombing.

00:00:59.024 --> 00:01:00.259
She was like, you could do that.

00:01:00.292 --> 00:01:01.594
I'm like, oh, yeah,
I could bomb better.

00:01:01.627 --> 00:01:03.796
What?

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:04.831
I gotta bomb better.

00:01:04.864 --> 00:01:06.132
I'm gonna bomb better.

00:01:06.165 --> 00:01:08.334
And I got up there
and I just loved it.

00:01:08.367 --> 00:01:09.635
It was amazing.

00:01:09.668 --> 00:01:11.838
It was an amazing feeling
making people laugh.

00:01:11.871 --> 00:01:13.439
I don't think anything
that I've ever done

00:01:13.472 --> 00:01:14.941
in my life compares to that.

00:01:14.974 --> 00:01:16.843
And I just kept going back
and then it's like, crap.

00:01:16.876 --> 00:01:18.044
It's like, I gotta.

00:01:18.077 --> 00:01:19.378
I gotta go make somebody laugh.
I gotta!

00:01:19.411 --> 00:01:20.313
So.

00:01:20.346 --> 00:01:21.347
And that's how I knew.

00:01:23.983 --> 00:01:24.817
I was--
- If none of you--

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:25.952
--addicted to it.

00:01:25.985 --> 00:01:29.755
--have ever taken
crack, this is

00:01:29.788 --> 00:01:31.791
as close as you'll get to it.

00:01:31.824 --> 00:01:33.793
So get on stage
and feed that drug.

00:01:33.826 --> 00:01:34.794
Give it to your system.

00:01:34.827 --> 00:01:35.928
You just start a reaction.

00:01:35.961 --> 00:01:38.698
It goes, I gotta have it!

00:01:38.731 --> 00:01:40.399
Is amazing, you'll love it.

00:01:40.432 --> 00:01:42.101
Just Nesh, are we ready
for "The Next Level?"

00:01:42.134 --> 00:01:43.569
We are so ready.
Been ready.

00:01:43.602 --> 00:01:44.303
Too ready.
- OK.

00:01:44.336 --> 00:01:45.171
Stop wiggling.

00:01:45.204 --> 00:01:46.439
What is this?

00:01:46.472 --> 00:01:47.273
Just Nesh!

00:01:47.306 --> 00:01:47.874
Thank you so much.

00:01:47.907 --> 00:01:49.107
Thank you so much.
