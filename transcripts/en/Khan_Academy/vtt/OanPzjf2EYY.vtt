00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.480
A water tank is 12 feet high,
5 feet long, and 9 feet wide.

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:09.190
A solid metal box which is
7 feet high, 4 feet long,

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:12.530
and 8 feet wide is sitting
at the bottom of the tank.

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:14.180
The tank is filled with water.

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.457
What is the volume of
the water in the tank?

00:00:16.457 --> 00:00:17.540
So let's think about this.

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:18.570
We have a water tank.

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:19.620
It's 12 feet high.

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:21.770
I'll try to draw this
as good as I can.

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:23.260
So it's 12 feet high.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:24.525
It's 5 feet long.

00:00:24.525 --> 00:00:27.300
So this looks like
that's about 5 feet.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.860
And it's 9 feet wide.

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:32.560
So this is my best rendition
of what a tank looks like.

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:36.370
So the tank might look
something like this.

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:38.910
That is my water tank.

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.030
Let me draw it, draw
the whole thing.

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.215
So there is my water tank.

00:00:44.215 --> 00:00:45.840
And I'm going to make
it transparent so

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.350
that we can see what's
going on inside of the tank.

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.132
So here we go.

00:00:52.132 --> 00:00:54.090
There's like a helicopter
outside or something,

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.830
I don't know if
you all hear that.

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:56.420
But let's see.

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:04.340
So there is my water tank
12 feet high, 5 feet long,

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:07.460
and 9 feet wide.

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.220
And then they say
there's a solid metal

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.300
box which is 7 feet high, 4
feet long, and 8 feet wide

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.357
sitting at the bottom.

00:01:16.357 --> 00:01:17.690
So let's see if I can draw that.

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:21.650
So let's say it's 4 feet wide.

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.030
Or I guess they say 4
feet long, 7 feet high.

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.750
So let's see, 4 feet might
look something like this.

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.350
It's 7 feet high, which might
look something like that.

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:34.530
7 feet high.

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.860
Obviously, I'm not drawing
it perfectly to scale.

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.690
7 feet high and 8 feet wide.

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:42.430
So it might look
something like this

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:45.690
as it's sitting in this tank.

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.020
So this is that metal box.

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.720
And they say it's
a solid metal box.

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.590
It's not like any
water can fit in here.

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.190
So let me make it as
a solid metal box.

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:57.870
So this is a solid metal box.

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:01.600
And then I'm going to fill
the whole thing with water.

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.660
I'm going to pour
water into this thing.

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:05.410
And the water's going
to start filling up.

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:07.770
And it's going to fill up
all the volume of the tank

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.101
except where the metal box is.

00:02:10.101 --> 00:02:12.100
It's not going to be able
to fill in that volume

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.029
because the metal box is solid.

00:02:15.029 --> 00:02:16.070
So it's going to fill up.

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.630
We're going to fill it,
slowly fill this thing up

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:19.871
around the metal box.

00:02:19.871 --> 00:02:21.870
So what's the volume that
it's going to fill up?

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.590
Well, it's going to
fill up the volume

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.360
of the tank minus the
volume of the metal box.

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.340
It couldn't fill in
the metal box volume.

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.170
So let's figure
out what that is.

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.760
The volume of the
tank is going to be

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:39.000
9 foot by 5 foot times 12 feet.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.970
That's the volume of the tank.

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:41.665
Tank volume.

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.150
And from that, we want to
subtract the metal box volume.

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:56.670
So minus 4 foot by
8 feet by 7 feet.

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.430
This is 4 feet wide.

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:09.110
It is 8 feet-- they
say it's 7 feet high.

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:10.240
It's 4 feet long.

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:12.980
And it's 8 feet wide.

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.700
So this right over
here is the volume.

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.270
I guess we could call
it the metal box volume.

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.980
When you take the tank volume
and subtract out the box

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.440
volume, that's how much the
water can actually fill in.

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.490
So I only drew the
water partially filled.

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:30.240
But once it's already
filled in, the water

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.200
is going to go all the
way to the top here.

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.600
And we'll fill in
everything except for where

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:34.580
that blue box is.

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:37.510
So let's figure out
what this value is.

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:39.530
So 5 times 12 is 60.

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:42.790
60 times 9 is 540.

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.450
And then in blue
here, let's see.

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.190
4 times 8 is 32.

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:52.480
32 times 7 is 210.

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.450
Plus 14, which is 224.

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:57.970
So it's minus 224.

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:59.017
Minus 224.

00:03:59.017 --> 00:03:59.850
Did I do that right?

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:01.516
I don't want to make
a careless mistake?

00:04:01.516 --> 00:04:03.410
So 32 times 7.

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:05.640
2 times 7 is 14.

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.090
3, which is really a 30 here.

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:11.770
30 times 7 is 210.

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:14.160
Plus another 10 is 220.

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.550
So 224.

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:19.850
So this is going to be
equal to-- let's see.

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:24.396
500 minus 200 is 300.

00:04:24.396 --> 00:04:29.670
And then 40 minus 24 is 16.

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:31.380
316.

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:34.616
And our units are in cubic feet.

00:04:34.616 --> 00:04:36.240
So the volume of the
water in the tank?

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.360
316 cubic feet.
