00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.104
Things every guy should know:

00:00:02.104 --> 00:00:05.363
1. Don't be afraid of being sensitive
and vulnerable.

00:00:05.363 --> 00:00:08.300
I know our society makes it seem like
that's a huge weakness and you

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:10.040
have to be this macho puff daddy

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:11.979
but, you're also a human being.

00:00:11.979 --> 00:00:14.449
Plus, anyone who makes fun of you
for being those things

00:00:14.449 --> 00:00:17.225
is just insecure about their
own masculinity.

00:00:17.225 --> 00:00:21.178
2. Don't be a "nice guy." Be a good guy.

00:00:21.178 --> 00:00:24.178
I feel like a lot of the 
people who claim to be "nice guys"

00:00:24.178 --> 00:00:25.240
aren't that nice.

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.018
Cause if you're really nice, do you
you have to constantly say,

00:00:28.018 --> 00:00:32.102
"Well I'm a nice guy! But I'm a
nice guy! I deserve this!"

00:00:32.401 --> 00:00:36.223
Just strive to be a good guy.
Because nice guys finish last.

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.309
And the good guys go first.

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.786
3. If you want something more than
friendship, and she doesn't,

00:00:41.786 --> 00:00:42.740
don't be friends.

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:45.570
A lot of guys talk about "the friendzone"
but guess what,

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.371
"The friendzone" is when two people are friends.

00:00:48.964 --> 00:00:50.375
That's all it is.

00:00:50.375 --> 00:00:53.891
Don't be one of those guys who pretends
that you're someone's friend just

00:00:53.891 --> 00:00:56.464
because you want to wait around for the
off-chance that you can fuck her.

00:00:56.464 --> 00:00:59.933
Because not only is that super fucking
disrespectful to you,

00:00:59.933 --> 00:01:01.099
but it's also like..

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:02.940
you deserve someone who wouldn't

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.631
be afraid to ask you out.

00:01:04.631 --> 00:01:07.693
Or someone who's like,
"Oh, I'm all about you, boo.

00:01:07.693 --> 00:01:08.904
Let's do this."

00:01:08.904 --> 00:01:10.223
Respect yourself, bro.

00:01:10.223 --> 00:01:12.299
4. Don't be afraid to feel.

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.661
I have 2 guy friends who are best
friends. They're super fucking besties.

00:01:15.661 --> 00:01:17.881
And I think it's the cutest thing ever

00:01:17.881 --> 00:01:19.714
when they hug each other, and like

00:01:19.714 --> 00:01:21.758
one will kiss the other on the forehead,

00:01:21.758 --> 00:01:23.534
or they'll like, kiss each other on the cheeks,

00:01:23.534 --> 00:01:27.152
or they'll just genuinely tell each other
that they love each other,

00:01:27.152 --> 00:01:30.121
and it's kinda sad that we don't have
that more often,

00:01:30.121 --> 00:01:31.665
and that men are like, kind of..

00:01:31.665 --> 00:01:34.126
If you like, love your bro so hard,

00:01:34.126 --> 00:01:36.619
you want to give them a fucking kiss
on the forehead,

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:38.848
give them a fucking kiss on the forehead.

00:01:38.848 --> 00:01:40.466
Now, if your best guy friend doesn't

00:01:40.466 --> 00:01:43.059
want these things from you, maybe
you should not,

00:01:43.059 --> 00:01:46.447
but I mean, you should at 
least TRY to kiss them on the forehead.

00:01:46.447 --> 00:01:47.527
He might like it.

00:01:47.527 --> 00:01:49.120
Before I thank today's sponsor,

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.588
I want to say thank you to everyone

00:01:50.588 --> 00:01:52.967
who bought a short film poster.

00:01:52.967 --> 00:01:57.665
I really, truely appreciate you spending
your money on

00:01:57.665 --> 00:01:59.619
a piece of paper that has my face on it.

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:01.557
I'm not gonna lie, that's really fucking cool.

00:02:01.557 --> 00:02:03.997
In different homes across the globe..

00:02:03.997 --> 00:02:06.679
I am staring at you, 24/7.

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:08.165
(softly) Watching you undress..

00:02:08.165 --> 00:02:10.058
Watching you do your homework..

00:02:10.058 --> 00:02:11.466
Watching you do everything.

00:02:11.466 --> 00:02:13.440
Watching you masturbate, (screeches)

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.379
I wish I can close my eyes, but I can't

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:16.527
because I'm a poster!

00:02:16.527 --> 00:02:18.804
Alright, so I haven't done a sponsor

00:02:18.804 --> 00:02:20.905
in a while, so today I'm gonna do Audible

00:02:20.905 --> 00:02:23.503
Everyone says that-that-that 
my voices suck,

00:02:23.503 --> 00:02:24.696
except the Japanese one,

00:02:24.696 --> 00:02:26.441
They're like "Ugh, just always do the Japanese

00:02:26.441 --> 00:02:28.588
one, cause it's the ONLY one you're good at."

00:02:28.588 --> 00:02:29.818
I disagree,

00:02:29.818 --> 00:02:32.211
but I do think the Japanese one is obviously

00:02:32.211 --> 00:02:34.818
like, much more marketable, for some reasons,

00:02:34.818 --> 00:02:36.727
so I'll just do the Japanese voice okay?

00:02:36.727 --> 00:02:38.624
(high pitched, Japanese accent)

Currently, I am listening to Gone Girl

00:02:55.997 --> 00:02:58.089
because all of my friends see it in the theater,

00:02:58.089 --> 00:03:00.319
they say it's so good. I'm like, "I don't see it yet."

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:03.405
and they're like, "Oh, it's so good, maybe you should
read the book first because you like the book

00:03:03.405 --> 00:03:04.619
more than the movie."

00:03:04.619 --> 00:03:06.467
