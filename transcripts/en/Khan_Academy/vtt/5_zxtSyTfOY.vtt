00:00:00.454 --> 00:00:02.078
- [Instructor] What we're
going to do in this video

00:00:02.078 --> 00:00:04.932
is think about limits involving
trigonometric functions.

00:00:04.932 --> 00:00:08.577
So let's just start with a
fairly straightforward one.

00:00:08.577 --> 00:00:12.744
Let's find the limit as x
approaches pi of sine of x.

00:00:14.421 --> 00:00:17.328
Pause the video and see if
you can figure this out.

00:00:17.328 --> 00:00:20.944
Well, with both sine of x and cosine of x,

00:00:20.944 --> 00:00:24.139
they are defined for all real numbers,

00:00:24.139 --> 00:00:25.789
so their domain is all real numbers.

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:28.111
You can put any real number in here for x

00:00:28.111 --> 00:00:29.823
and it will give you an output.

00:00:29.823 --> 00:00:31.041
It is defined.

00:00:31.041 --> 00:00:34.549
And they are also continuous
over their entire domain,

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:37.258
in fact, all of the trigonometric
functions are continuous

00:00:37.258 --> 00:00:39.576
over their entire domain.

00:00:39.576 --> 00:00:43.079
And so for sine of x,
because it's continuous,

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.532
and is defined at sine of pi,

00:00:45.532 --> 00:00:48.546
we would say that this
is the same thing as

00:00:48.546 --> 00:00:49.463
sine of pi,

00:00:50.463 --> 00:00:53.034
and sine of pi, you might already know,

00:00:53.034 --> 00:00:54.451
is equal to zero.

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.477
Now we could do a similar
exercise with cosine of x,

00:00:58.477 --> 00:01:01.815
so if I were to say what's
the limit as x approaches,

00:01:01.815 --> 00:01:06.120
I'll just take an arbitrary
angle, x approaches pi over four

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.370
of cosine of x?

00:01:08.951 --> 00:01:09.868
Well once again,

00:01:09.868 --> 00:01:13.566
cosine of x is defined
for all real numbers,

00:01:13.566 --> 00:01:15.230
x can be any real number.

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:16.608
It's also continuous.

00:01:16.608 --> 00:01:20.567
So for cosine of x, this
limit is just gonna be cosine

00:01:20.567 --> 00:01:21.900
of pi over four,

00:01:24.011 --> 00:01:26.472
and that is going to be equal

00:01:26.472 --> 00:01:29.115
to square root of two over two.

00:01:29.115 --> 00:01:31.994
This is one of those useful angles

00:01:31.994 --> 00:01:34.318
to know the sine and cosine of.

00:01:34.318 --> 00:01:37.161
If you're thinking degrees,
this is a 45 degree angle.

00:01:37.161 --> 00:01:40.762
And in general, if I'm dealing
with a sine or a cosine,

00:01:40.762 --> 00:01:44.345
the limit as x approaches a of sine of x

00:01:46.391 --> 00:01:48.224
is equal to sine of a.

00:01:49.934 --> 00:01:52.413
Once again, this is going
to be true for any a,

00:01:52.413 --> 00:01:54.023
any real number a.

00:01:54.023 --> 00:01:56.909
And I can make a similar
statement about cosine of x.

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.326
Limit as x approaches a of cosine of x

00:02:01.997 --> 00:02:04.284
is equal to cosine of a.

00:02:04.284 --> 00:02:05.971
Now, I've been saying it over and over,

00:02:05.971 --> 00:02:08.905
that's because both of their
domains are all real numbers,

00:02:08.905 --> 00:02:12.287
they are defined for all
real numbers that you put in,

00:02:12.287 --> 00:02:15.257
and they're continuous
on their entire domain.

00:02:15.257 --> 00:02:18.590
But now, let's do slightly more involved

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:22.672
trigonometric functions,
or ones that aren't defined

00:02:22.672 --> 00:02:25.358
for all real numbers, that
their domains are constrained

00:02:25.358 --> 00:02:27.591
just a little bit more.

00:02:27.591 --> 00:02:30.573
So let's say if we were to take the limit

00:02:30.573 --> 00:02:33.740
as x approaches pi of tangent of x.

00:02:37.361 --> 00:02:40.174
What is this going to be equal to?

00:02:40.174 --> 00:02:43.365
Well, this is the same thing as the limit

00:02:43.365 --> 00:02:45.599
as x approaches pi.

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:49.682
Tangent of x is sine
of x over cosine of x.

00:02:52.332 --> 00:02:55.582
And so both of these are defined for pi

00:02:56.771 --> 00:02:59.938
and so we could just substitute pi in.

00:03:00.811 --> 00:03:02.913
And we just wanna ensure
that we don't get a zero

00:03:02.913 --> 00:03:05.598
in the denominator, because
that would make it undefined.

00:03:05.598 --> 00:03:07.265
So we get sine of pi

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:15.356
over cosine of pi which is
equal to zero over negative one,

00:03:16.647 --> 00:03:17.692
which is completely fine.

00:03:17.692 --> 00:03:19.549
If it was negative one over
zero, we'd be in trouble.

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:21.991
But this is just gonna be equal to zero.

00:03:21.991 --> 00:03:23.698
So that works out.

00:03:23.698 --> 00:03:25.784
But if I were to ask
you, what is the limit

00:03:25.784 --> 00:03:29.701
as x approaches pi over
two of tangent of x?

00:03:32.251 --> 00:03:35.809
Pause the video and try to work that out.

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:36.852
Well, think about it.

00:03:36.852 --> 00:03:40.523
This is the limit as x
approaches pi over two

00:03:40.523 --> 00:03:43.273
of sine of x over cosine of x.

00:03:46.535 --> 00:03:49.741
Now sine of pi over two is one,

00:03:49.741 --> 00:03:51.992
but cosine of pi over two is zero.

00:03:51.992 --> 00:03:53.697
So if you were to just substitute in,

00:03:53.697 --> 00:03:56.530
this would give you one over zero.

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.562
And one way to think
about it is pi over two

00:04:01.562 --> 00:04:04.391
is not in the domain of tangent of x.

00:04:04.391 --> 00:04:07.588
And so this limit actually
turns out, it doesn't exist.

00:04:07.588 --> 00:04:09.915
In general, if we're
dealing with the sine,

00:04:09.915 --> 00:04:14.055
cosine, tangent, or cosecant,
secant, or cotangent,

00:04:14.055 --> 00:04:16.551
if we're taking a limit to a point

00:04:16.551 --> 00:04:20.336
that's in their domain,
then the value of the limit

00:04:20.336 --> 00:04:22.477
is going to be the same thing as the value

00:04:22.477 --> 00:04:24.455
of the function at that point.

00:04:24.455 --> 00:04:26.162
If you're taking a limit to a point

00:04:26.162 --> 00:04:27.607
that's not in their domain,

00:04:27.607 --> 00:04:30.321
there's a good chance that
we're not going to have a limit.

00:04:30.321 --> 00:04:32.571
So here, there is no limit.

00:04:33.551 --> 00:04:36.458
And the way to do that is that pi over two

00:04:36.458 --> 00:04:39.231
is not in tangent of x's domain.

00:04:39.231 --> 00:04:41.412
If you were to graph
tan of x, you would see

00:04:41.412 --> 00:04:44.825
a vertical asymptote at pi over two.

00:04:44.825 --> 00:04:47.635
Let's do one more of these.

00:04:47.635 --> 00:04:51.802
So let's say the limit as x
approaches pi of cotangent of x,

00:04:55.665 --> 00:04:57.482
pause the video and see
if you can figure out

00:04:57.482 --> 00:04:59.889
what that's going to be.

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:01.423
Well, one way to think about it,

00:05:01.423 --> 00:05:03.703
cotangent of x is one over tangent of x,

00:05:03.703 --> 00:05:06.620
it's cosine of x over sine of x.

00:05:08.581 --> 00:05:12.277
This is a limit as x approaches pi

00:05:12.277 --> 00:05:13.110
of this.

00:05:14.067 --> 00:05:17.567
And is pi in the domain of cotangent of x?

00:05:19.351 --> 00:05:22.137
Well, no, if you were
just to substitute pi in,

00:05:22.137 --> 00:05:25.160
you're gonna get negative one over zero.

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:28.074
And so that is not in the
domain of cotangent of x.

00:05:28.074 --> 00:05:30.231
If you were to plot it, you
would see a vertical asymptote

00:05:30.231 --> 00:05:31.383
right over there.

00:05:31.383 --> 00:05:32.970
And so we have no limit.

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:34.387
We have no limit.

00:05:37.252 --> 00:05:40.561
So once again, this is
not in the domain of that,

00:05:40.561 --> 00:05:43.461
and so good chance that we have no limit.

00:05:43.461 --> 00:05:45.818
When the thing we're taking the limit to

00:05:45.818 --> 00:05:48.929
is in the domain of the
trigonometric function,

00:05:48.929 --> 00:05:51.215
we're going to have a defined limit.

00:05:51.215 --> 00:05:53.972
And sine and cosine in
particular are defined

00:05:53.972 --> 00:05:56.383
for all real numbers
and they're continuous

00:05:56.383 --> 00:05:57.858
over all real numbers.

00:05:57.858 --> 00:05:59.773
So you take the limit
to anything for them,

00:05:59.773 --> 00:06:02.088
it's going to be defined
and it's going to be

00:06:02.088 --> 00:06:05.269
the value of the function at that point.
