1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:04,800
There are three major defense strategies.
Avoidance.

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:08,490
Simply stay out of the way.
Resistance,

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:12,390
fight against it and
tolerance deal with it.

4
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:13,343
Okay.

5
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:17,980
Avoidance behaviors
reduce pathogen exposure.

6
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:23,640
They include innate and acquired aversions
to markers of high microbial density

7
00:00:24,101 --> 00:00:28,300
such as smell or taste,
nausea and feelings of disgust,

8
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:31,870
which help to prevent infections
and exposure to toxic compounds.

9
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:33,500
Yeah.

10
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,840
Avoidance is a normal defensive response,

11
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:39,260
but people vary significantly
in its expression.

12
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:44,810
The extreme responses Germaphobia which
is a common form of obsessive compulsive

13
00:00:44,811 --> 00:00:45,644
disorder.

14
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:47,370
Okay,

15
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:51,870
so here are some Roman latrines
and here is a yellow fever.

16
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:52,740
Quarantine.

17
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:56,700
Quarantine is a way of simply making
sure that people are not exposed.

18
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:00,010
Okay.

19
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:04,600
Resistance mechanisms are mechanisms
that aim to eliminate the infection.

20
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:06,430
Once it's been established,

21
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:11,620
they reduce the pathogen burden
by detecting, destroying,

22
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:13,480
and eliminating the pathogen.

23
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,900
That's the main function
of the immune system.

24
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:18,883
Yeah.

25
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:20,980
Depending on the resistance strategy,

26
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:25,360
immune responses can themselves cause
different kinds of immunopathology,

27
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:29,590
auto immune diseases, allergies,
asthma, colitis, and so forth.

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,120
So resistance can be very costly.

29
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:36,210
Okay.

30
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:40,740
There may come a point at which tolerating
and infection is less costly than

31
00:01:40,741 --> 00:01:43,290
resisting it.
So consider a host and the pathogen.

32
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:47,370
There can be direct damage
caused by the pathogen.

33
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:50,610
There can be resistance to the pathogen,

34
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:54,240
but then there can also be damaged
that's caused by the immune response.

35
00:01:55,620 --> 00:02:00,620
The host can then also try to block the
direct damaged by the pathogen and the

36
00:02:02,791 --> 00:02:06,600
host can try to decrease the damage
caused by the immune response.

37
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:12,470
So there is quite a list of costs
and benefits involved in resistance.

38
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:15,883
Tolerance

39
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:20,810
is another way of dealing
with environmental insult.

40
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:25,640
Tolerance mechanisms reduce the negative
effects on host fitness of a given

41
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:29,750
level of pathogen burden.
They probably won't eliminate them,

42
00:02:29,751 --> 00:02:34,751
but they will reduce the
impact they protect and repair
tissue through inducible

43
00:02:35,451 --> 00:02:36,284
maintenance.

44
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:40,760
And because tolerance mechanisms
do not affect pathogens directly,

45
00:02:40,761 --> 00:02:45,320
they impose less selection on pathogens
than do resistance mechanisms.

46
00:02:45,321 --> 00:02:49,190
So if the host is tolerating a pathogen,

47
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:51,560
that is a different outcome,

48
00:02:51,561 --> 00:02:56,540
probably in host pathogen coevolution
than if the host is resisting the

49
00:02:56,541 --> 00:02:59,330
pathogen.
Consequently,

50
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:03,700
there is less of an arms race and there
was little variation among individuals

51
00:03:03,701 --> 00:03:07,570
for tolerance. Genes in sharp
contrast to resistance genes,

52
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:12,550
which are highly polymorphic indicating
a long history of co-evolutionary

53
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:13,443
interaction

54
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:19,120
tolerance mechanisms help to sustain
homeostatic relationships with commensal

55
00:03:19,121 --> 00:03:23,710
microorganisms in the highly
colonized sites such as the colon.

56
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:28,740
So tolerance plays a big role in the
way the immune system manages the

57
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:31,023
Microbiota.

58
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:32,770
Okay.

59
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:36,580
Like resistance tolerance can
also be costly. For example,

60
00:03:36,581 --> 00:03:39,910
tissue protection can
interfere with tissue function.

61
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:47,100
One way to conceptualize resistance and
tolerance is to think of reaction norms.

62
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:52,880
So in the left hand panel here we have
on the x axis pathogen burden increasing

63
00:03:53,971 --> 00:03:57,960
to the right,
we have host fitness here on the left,

64
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:03,710
the more resistant genotype has lower
pathogen burden and is more fit.

65
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:09,480
The less resistant genotype has higher
pathogen burden and is less fit.

66
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:10,920
Okay.

67
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:15,540
If we then look at the tolerance
concept with the same axes,

68
00:04:15,541 --> 00:04:17,460
pathogen burden and host fitness,

69
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:21,360
the Blue Line here is the
less tolerant genotype.

70
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:26,070
So as pathogen burden increases,
it loses fitness fairly rapidly.

71
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:28,680
The more tolerant genotype is one,

72
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:32,910
whereas pathogen burden increases
fitnesses lost more slowly.

73
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:38,330
What about defense priorities?

74
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:44,120
All defenses aim to
insulate vital organs first.

75
00:04:44,121 --> 00:04:47,270
That would be brain and
heart and processes,

76
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:52,420
the cardiovascular and respiratory
processes from environmental challenges.

77
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:57,500
This is often done by changing
resource allocation in the body.

78
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,780
So during prolonged fasting,

79
00:04:59,781 --> 00:05:04,781
the brain continues to utilize glucose
at the expense of the other tissues for

80
00:05:05,241 --> 00:05:09,500
glucose uptake in the brain is not
insulin dependent and that's unlike other

81
00:05:09,501 --> 00:05:13,760
major glucose consuming tissues,
primarily skeletal muscle and fat.

82
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:15,170
Okay.

83
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:17,720
Similar to Lee.
During hypoxia,

84
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:23,270
the more oxygenated blood
is disproportionately
distributed to the brain during

85
00:05:23,271 --> 00:05:26,360
hypothermia.
And the same is true for the warmer blood.

86
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:30,223
Yeah,

87
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:34,700
there are certain vital tissues and
organs that are known as immunoprivileged

88
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:38,930
sites that are protected from
important kinds of immunopathology.

89
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:43,970
They include the brain,
the gonads and the eyes.

90
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:50,530
Immune responses that have the potential
to destroy tissue are not permitted in

91
00:05:50,531 --> 00:05:54,820
these tissues which pay less
for the cost of immune response.

92
00:05:56,380 --> 00:06:00,630
So there is a spectrum of tissue
vulnerability to immuno pathology from

93
00:06:00,631 --> 00:06:04,590
dispensable renewable tissues
to immunoprivileged tissues.

94
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:09,270
And there is a spectrum of tissue
responsiveness to inflammatory mediators.

95
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:14,780
So immunoprivileged tissues do not
respond to inflammatory mediators and

96
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:20,660
dispensable and renewal
tissues are actually

97
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:25,690
ones in which you can have
significant immunopathology.

98
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:34,760
So if we look here at
different physiological axes,

99
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:41,250
what we see is the tissue vulnerability
to damage is affecting tolerance,

100
00:06:41,251 --> 00:06:46,251
capacity and priority and cost
allocation for defense and repair.

101
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:52,640
So the intrinsic susceptibility of damage
to damage is higher in brain and heart

102
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:58,530
and lower in liver and skin,
which can repair more easily.

103
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:04,640
The ability to renew and repair is low
in neurons and cardiomyocytes and higher

104
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,810
in liver cells and intestinal epithelium.

105
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:12,360
The autonomy,

106
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:17,570
the functional autonomy of neurons and
sensory epithelium is relatively low.

107
00:07:17,851 --> 00:07:22,710
The functional autonomy of hepatocytes
and red blood cells is relatively high.

108
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,470
And the consequences of damage,
the damage,

109
00:07:25,471 --> 00:07:30,471
sec will or severe in brain and Invesco
are in respiratory systems and our

110
00:07:30,841 --> 00:07:32,460
moderate in liver and skin.

111
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:38,780
So these tissues have low tolerance
and these tissues have high tolerance.

112
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:44,133
Summarize

113
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:50,980
defense priorities say that if possible,
avoid the threat using vision,

114
00:07:50,981 --> 00:07:54,010
taste and smell if infected,

115
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:57,670
then one has to make a choice
to resist or to tolerate.

116
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,150
Make that decision depending on the costs.

117
00:08:01,151 --> 00:08:03,490
And benefits of resistance and tolerance.

118
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:09,130
These benefits and costs vary
among tissues and organs.

119
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:14,350
The critical organs are immune privileged
to avoid the cost of inflammation.

120
00:08:14,351 --> 00:08:14,400
Yeah.
