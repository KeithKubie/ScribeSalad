Hello I'm the Nostalgia Critic

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:33.580
and this is Niagara Falls!

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.680
I'm at one of the largest waterfalls in the world

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:43.880
and to celebrate I'm going to

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.140
let you, yes, you, the people decide

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.920
what I'm going to review next here at Niagara Falls.

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:52.380
So how about it everyone?

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:53.980
You have me here at Niagara Falls,

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:55.900
what would you like me to review?

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:02.480
[Crowd] The third animated Titanic movie!

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:07.180
Really? 'Cause I could have sworn you were going to choose the Marilyn Monroe movie Niagara.

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.200
The romance between her and Joseph Cotton had been described as

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.860
a raging torrent of emotion that 
even nature can't control!

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.200
[Crowd] The third animated Titanic movie!

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.420
but Monroe plays a tantalizing temptress 
that kisses fired men's souls

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.660
you can't deny such poorly worded smut!

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:24.920
[Crowd] THE THIRD ANIMATED TITANIC MOVIE!

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.720
Alright, fine I'll review this movie that has nothing to do with Niagara Falls

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.640
that you guys have wanted me to review for years

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:32.560
will that make you happy?

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:38.680
[ And the Crowd Goes Wild ]

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:39.680
[Malcolm] But what about the script?

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.720
[Critic] It doesn't matter, people made up their mind

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:42.320
[Tamara] I wanted to play Marilyn

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:43.960
[Critic] Oh come on, it's a Nostalgia Critic review!

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:44.860
you know Malcolm would get the part

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.880
[smug chuckle]

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.620
But what about the guest stars?

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:49.500
We're just going to have to can them too.

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.940
Show's canceled.

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:58.460
[Brad] Welp, I know a gaggle of hookers soon to have my name on them

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:00.080
[sigh]

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:05.620
[Brad]  It's locked from the outside.

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:08.060
[James] Well that goes along with him cutting the phone and the TV.

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:09.140
[Cricket] Who does that?

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.080
[Dante] He said it would keep us in character.

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.040
[Cricket]  As what? Amish bed testers?

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.740
[Brad] Is that why he also took our phones and deep fried them?

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.380
[Dante] I really should have drawn the line at that.

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.500
[James] Why do we do things with him?!

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:27.260
For those who don't know, years ago, I reviewed an animated Titanic musical known as "Titanic: The Legend Goes On".

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.340
Not only was it an obvious ripoff of the James Cameron film,

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:31.860
But it had racist singing mice,

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.320
A forced happy ending,

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:34.480
And a rapping dog.

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.520
Yeah. A rapping dog on the Titanic.

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.760
It was one of the most tasteless abominations ever.

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:47.460
At least it was, until I found ANOTHER animated Titanic musical called "The Legend of Titanic".

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.300
It had racist singing mice,

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:50.740
A forced happy ending,

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:51.680
BUT,

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.680
No rapping dog.

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.600
That was replaced with a glove-sniffing fetishist,

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.260
Sharks that escaped from jail that sink the ship instead of an iceberg,

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:06.660
And a giant puppy dog squid who puts the ship back together so that everyone can get out alive.

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.020
Good, chocolate-coated, GOD!

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.300
As if having two of these in existence wasn't enough for Skynet to want to kill us,

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:15.880
This last one actually got a sequel.

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:20.680
Because, sinking the Titanic was clearly just Part 1!

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.680
The sequel is the one we're looking at today, called:

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:33.660
Just when you thought things couldn't possibly get any stupider in a world that focuses on the sinking of the Titanic,

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.520
What does this one throw in?

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:36.700
Atlantis!

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:41.240
Yeah. Titanic and Atlantis now exist in the same universe.

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:44.240
Well, I guess it is the next logical step.

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:45.980
It just keeps going in descending order.

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:47.580
"Titanic in Atlantis",

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:49.020
"Titanic in Space",

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:50.960
"Titanic: Assignment Miami Beach",

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:51.920
And of course,

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:52.960
"Titanic in the Hood"

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:54.740
Shaq: That's some Green Eggs and Havoc!

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:57.640
The funny thing is, this wasn't even originally called that.

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:01.660
It was originally called "Tentacolino", the name of the puppypus in the last movie,

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:03.660
Even though he's barely in it.

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:06.900
But his name was changed from the Italian version to something more simple.

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.680
What...ever they choose to call him...

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.080
Multiple Movie Characters (With varying accents): Otti!

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:14.440
Yeah...any of these...

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.800
And thus it became a Titanic movie once again.

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:19.860
Meaning I have to review it...

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:21.740
And believe it or not,

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:28.100
It is actually, NO joke, NOT kidding, Even WORSE than the other two!

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:32.680
Not one hint of sarcasm, this is the worst one!

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:40.080
Now, I do have this tradition of drinking a rather large bottle of Jäger every time I review one of these,

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:45.380
And seeing that this is somehow the absolute worst out of all of them,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.920
It's time to push the button!

00:04:51.160 --> 00:05:00.820
♪♪

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:02.900
Tamara: I know where I'm vacationing this week!

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:07.740
Critic: Let us begin.

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:10.600
We start with a recap of the last film,

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:14.440
And if you think you know the story of the Titanic and don't need a recap,

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:18.520
You clearly haven't seen it from writers whose everyday dinner looks like this.

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:24.620
It was called the "Ripoff of Dreams",

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:27.580
And it was. It really was.

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:31.860
It says the film takes place three years after the Titanic sunk...

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:37.000
Where apparently, there's been quite the technology boom in those short years!

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.040
I guess the 2001 aliens are dropping monoliths on marine biologists.

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:47.140
But it looks like they only got half the enlightenment, because the only people going down to search for the Titanic are two of the passengers,

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:49.380
and their dog from the first one!

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:52.560
Umm...are they really qualified?

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:57.200
Just because they were on the Titanic, doesn't mean they can find the damn thing!

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:01.160
(Imitating random person)
Hey! I know where Amelia Earhart is because I watch an episode of Star Trek she was on!

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.760
(Imitating random person) 
Millions in research funds, please!

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:08.780
I guarantee though, they're gonna see stranger things in this yellow submarine than The Beatles ever did.

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:11.500
Starting with their dog, who can talk to them now!

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:14.720
Dog: Seems to me there's a lot of nasty-looking sharks out there.

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:20.200
Oh, it must be those magic moon beams in the last film that came from a woman's tears that-

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:22.440
You know...life is too precious. It's not worth the time...

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:26.100
And don't forget about the little mice friends from the last one,

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:28.920
Who are just as afraid of the sharks watching them as the dog is.

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.460
Prince "Joe": We're at sea! This is their home.

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:33.760
Prince "Joe": Honestly, there really isn't anything to worry about.

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:36.500
Dog: Sharks, indeed...They're worse than cats!

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:38.160
"Joe": Even cats eat mice.

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.380
*giggling*

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:45.380
Critic: Haha! We lose thousands of lives to your house pets everyday! It's funny! It's funny!

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:48.420
Cut to immediate style change...

Captain Razorteeth: ♪They're so sharp 'n white 'n neat!♪

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:58.280
Critic: WHY DO THESE MOVIES NEED RAP SONGS?!

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:00.120
I just don't see the connection!

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:05.800
Was the rap song in the other film such a worldwide phenomenon that the movie said:

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:07.660
"Hey! We can make it whiter!"

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:09.920
Razorteeth: ♪YEAAAAHHH, There's no one crueler than me!♪

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:11.920
Razorteeth: ♪I'm a great big genius that lives in the sea!♪

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:13.540
Critic: Oooh, man. You better look out.

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:18.220
There's gonna be a rap battle between this and the Polar Express chefs who sing the Hot Chocolate song.

Chorus: ♪There's no one meaner than YOU!♪

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:27.920
Critic: What the hell are they even saying?

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:31.380
It's so gargled that I think we're just supposed to interpret our own lyrics.

00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:44.720
So the head of the sharks is told about the Simpsons testicle, and he tells his minions to attack it.

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:45.500
Why?

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:48.900
His detailed reasoning will send shivers down your spine!

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:51.080
Razorteeth: Are you sure it's yellow?

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:53.080
I hate that color.

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:55.080
I can't stand yellow!

00:07:56.580 --> 00:08:01.140
Critic: Macbeth had the inner duality of acquiring power while holding on to his humanity.

00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:05.280
Ahab demonstrated how revenge can destroy others, as well as yourself.

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:07.540
This character hates yellow.

00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:12.400
If that brilliantly established motivation doesn't give you goosebumps, I weep for you!

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:15.680
So he orders the sharks to start sinking their teeth into it.

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:17.020
Elizabeth: What's happening?!

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:21.200
"Joe": Calm down, Smile. Relax. It must've been an underwater current.

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:24.160
Critic: (imitating "Joe")
It couldn't be those things I said wouldn't attack us attacking.

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:25.840
(imitating "Joe")
Let's make another joke about cats.

00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:27.760
Shark: Let's cut the cables!

00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:31.380
Critic: They chew on the cables so discretely that they don't make any sound effects-

00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:35.320
(Must be on "Silent" running...)

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:37.320
-as they're tossed around inside.

00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:39.600
"Joe": Try to stay calm!

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:41.760
Critic: Yeah...because that worked so well before.

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:44.000
What was your advice on the Titanic? Read a book?

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:49.000
The cable is cut, but the sharks don't want to finish them off just yet.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:49.720
The reason?

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:52.940
Shark: Right now, I have to go and brush my teeth.

00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:56.560
Critic: A lot of people underestimate the importance of shark dental hygiene.

00:08:57.420 --> 00:08:58.940
But in a bizarre twist,

00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:02.480
The sharks are also in cahoots with the bad guy from the first film (Evarard),

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:05.180
As they communicate via jellyfish telegram!

00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:07.680
Okay...

00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:10.780
Evarard: Jeffery! Now, this is important!

00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:13.980
I want our mini-submarines to be in a permanent state of alert!

00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:16.520
Critic: JESUS! How many submarines did they have back then?

00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:20.280
If your evil plan is to get rich, I'd say mission already accomplished!

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:24.740
Our Muppet tentacle porn comes across the sinking sub, but can't pull it out,

00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:28.340
Even though he was originally strong enough to put the Titanic back together.

00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:29.980
Who can he get to help?

00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:33.040
Merman: Whoaaa!

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:35.220
Critic: It begins...

00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:41.720
Yep. An army of Every 80's Girl Toy that Ever Existed arrive and tell the Craptopus that they can help.

00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:45.260
Thank god they use their advanced technology of Bubble in a Can-

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:46.280
(F*cking Bubbles!)

00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:49.220
-And ride their literal sea horses to the city of Atlantis

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:52.120
Their dog, Smile, wakes up to see what's happening.

00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:53.700
Smile: Help! I'm dead!

00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:55.100
Mermaid: Keep calm. You're all safe.

00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:58.300
Smile: No! I'm dead, and you're taking me to Doggy Hell!

00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:00.560
Critic: Wow! Thanks for putting that idea into kids' heads!

00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:02.680
Did your puppy ever bite you? He could go here!

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:09.560
They take them to Dr. Calamity Jane as our heroes discover that Atlantis is kinda like a creepy Comfort Inn,

00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:11.560
Except somehow even more hostile!

00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:14.140
Guard: Go and get things ready, immediately!

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:15.200
Elizabeth: Get what ready?

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:16.260
"Joe": Calm down.

00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:17.700
Elizabeth: Me?
"Joe": Yes.

00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:20.340
Critic: Wow! What an asshole!

00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:25.300
(imitaiting "Joe")
Talk out of line again, and I will smite down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger!

00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:27.380
(imitaiting "Joe")
You will know my name as The Lord!

00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:30.860
Guard: You have to drink the elixir before you visit the city.

00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:32.920
"Joe": Of course. Keep calm....

00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:35.280
Critic: STOP SAYING KEEP CALM!!!!!

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:38.300
Have you noticed all the bullshit it got you in?

00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:39.700
Look sharks! Keep calm.

00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:41.500
We're gonna drown! Keep calm!

00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:43.080
Drink this incredibly suspicious shit!

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:45.060
"Joe": This elixir is such a pretty color!

00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:47.320
Critic: The skull and crossbones are especially adorable!

00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:48.900
(gurgles)

00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:57.620
Guard: I'm honored to introduce to you: My squadron of Mermaids and Mermen!

00:10:58.120 --> 00:10:58.740
Critic: (imitating Merpeople)
Bye!

00:10:58.740 --> 00:11:00.140
(imitating Merpeople)
Why do we show up for this again?

00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:01.460
(imitating Merpeople)
Does he think we can hear him through that?

00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:03.800
Guard: We must go! It's getting late!

00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:06.440
Critic: The mall closes half past kidnap'o'clock.

00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:08.720
Guard: How do you like it?

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:10.600
Mouse: It's like a dream!

00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:13.460
Critic: No. Dreams make sense compared to this.

00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:18.780
They then take him to a room full of toys who have the ability to speak and achieve conscious thought.

00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:20.140
How is this possible?

00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:25.000
Guard: Everything lives, moves, and thinks, even if it seems impossible at times!

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.580
Critic: Oh that explains that. How about a creepy song number?

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:31.000
Counselor: ♪Here is a surprise! (Hmmm....)♪

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.200
♪You can thank your lucky stars that I have saved your lives!♪

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:38.060
Critic: I don't like this guy's voice...

00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:40.860
He sounds like the Crypt Keeper if he was choking on Gollum.

00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:44.220
Counselor: ♪I will say without mistake (Ahahahaha!)♪

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:48.900
♪Atlantis is the only place where you always stay awake!♪

00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:51.720
Critic: This is the last thing we'll see before we die!

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:55.040
But you know what this song really needs?

00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:56.140
Rave music.

00:11:56.660 --> 00:11:59.440
♪The water is fresh! You can swim around!♪

00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:02.420

♪Come into my show. It doesn't cost a dime!♪

00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:08.920
♪Every single day, it's always party time!♪

00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:10.780
Critic: This review is writing itself.

00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:12.200
I'm not even kidding! Look!

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:14.580
T-This review is literally writing itself!

00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:23.760
This is so terrifyingly, batshit insane, that you can actually hear someone offscreen declaring "This is scary!"

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:25.800
I'm not even kidding! Listen closely!

00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:31.480
Did you hear that? I swear she said "This is scary!"

00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:35.620
Yes it is, poor soul...

00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:38.880
I think we know who the real survivors involving the Titanic should be!

00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:42.740
But the musical Counselor lets some uncomfortable news slip:

00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:47.420
Counselor: ♪Up there? You can't. Go. Back!♪

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:52.960
Critic: (Imitating Counselor)
Oh. I'm sorry. I was supposed to tell you that after the chloroform sprinklers went off...

00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:55.580
Holy christ! I need a drink!

00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:00.080
Hey! Who drank my Jäger planet!?

00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:04.040

Malcom: There's a sun...

00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:39.820
Critic: So they end up meeting the King of Atlantis and-

00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:40.320
Wha!

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:44.440
King: From now on, Atlantis will be your home, and you will not be able to leave it.

00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:46.780
Critic: Who's...a...Ring Wraith now...

00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:52.360
King: I hope you will accept my apologies for the lack of tack displayed by our counselor when he gave you the news.

00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:56.580
"Joe": On the contrary. It's better that we were told about the situation right away.

00:13:56.580 --> 00:14:03.380
And I have to say: your counselor informed us in the most amusing way which helped us all to see the benefit.

00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:09.440
Critic: Yes, I love being told I'm a hostage via bullshit music that even Radio Disney would throw in acid.

00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:12.020
Clearly, you thought long and hard about this,

00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:17.580
He is also told that the elixir not only has them breathe underwater, but also it can have them live forever.

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:21.500
Again, would've been a nice nugget of knowledge to know earlier...

00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:25.600
Dolphin: Your friends aren't still getting over the shock of the news, are they?

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:30.920
"Joe": No. They're still a bit surprised by it, but they understand that we have no choice in the matter.

00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:34.160
Critic: What are you smoking to be so okay with this!?

00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:36.920
Captain America: Now might be a really good time for you to get angry.

00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:39.620
Our mice friends come across other mice in Atlantis.

00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:43.260
Because that's a common Atlantean infestation.

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:46.360
And it turns out they are even more offensive stereotypes than them.

00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:47.360
Karate Rat: Hiya!

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:48.540
You can never be too pruedent.

00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:49.260
After you.

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:50.300
Everything is ready!

00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:51.240
Is open!

00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:52.520
But you can trust us, you know.

00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:55.180
Get out of here! Go! And take the flask with you!

00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:59.200
Critic: Uhhh...We call him Mickey Mouse Rooney.

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:03.080
While that's going on, Smile comes across a new companion

00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:13.080
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Slow down! We haven't even sniffed each other's asses yet!

00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:21.980
Oh!

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:24.440
I guess that scene was over...

00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:28.260
This movie has the smooth transition of a slap to your balls.

00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:29.700
Muscular Rat: Who are these?

00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:33.380
Pirate Rat: The chief did say that all rats should be present, you idiot.

00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:36.800
You're so stupid, I'd bet you would appear in the same background in a jump cut.

00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:41.740
So the rats of this underwater world don't like the Atlanteans and want to take them over.

00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:45.760
Rat Chief: Let's take a huge stash of the Elixir of Life with us!

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:50.880
Thanks to the Elixir, we will be able to conquer the world,

00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:54.700
And we'll offer that annoying little pink octopus as a present to Razorteeth!

00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:57.260
That fish is the one that causes all the problems-

00:15:57.260 --> 00:15:58.480
Mouse 1: Razorteeth?

00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:00.480
Pirate Rat: Yes, he's our ally.

00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:06.800
Critic: Wow! I never accumulated so many questions in such a short amount of time...

00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:09.040
How did the rats get there?

00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:11.740
If they didn't drink the elixir, how can they be there?

00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:14.400
How will the elixir make them rule the world?

00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:16.400
Why do they want to rule the world?

00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:19.180
What issues do they have with the Atlantean government?

00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:21.240
How does the Atlantean government work?

00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:24.120
Why do they think the octopus causes all the problems?

00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:26.120
How are they in contact with the sharks?

00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:28.120
Why are they in contact with the sharks?

00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:32.040
This bullshit makes so little sense, you can call it "Brexitlantis"!

00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:34.800
This news eventually gets back to our heroes.

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:39.120
"Joe": This time, we should all be there. Do I make myself perfectly clear, Smile?

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:41.860
Smile: But I can't come. I'm really scared of water!

00:16:41.860 --> 00:16:45.080
I had a bad experience when I was only a puppy...

00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:49.320
Critic: Oh, and being on the Titanic probably played a small part in that.

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:52.440
Oh, by the way, AREN'T WE SUPPOSED TO BE LOOKING FOR THAT?

00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:58.160
For a film called "In Search of the Titanic", there's very little searching for the Titanic.

00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:02.120
Even for the original title, "Tentacolino", he's barely in this, either.

00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:03.460
You might as well call it:

00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:05.560
"Left Shoe on Lady's Foot"

00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:08.680
It would make about as much sense and be far more engaging!

00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:13.140
So they tell the King about the evil plot, and how they also plan to take apart his Counsellor.

00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:17.200
Counsellor: If they dismantle me with a screwdriver, I'll die!

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:21.620
Dolphin: They'll have to have a screwdriver, and down here in Atlantis, there are no screwdrivers!

00:17:21.620 --> 00:17:23.160
They've all been banned!

00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:24.980
Critic: Wha...Wait a minute...

00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:26.520
No screwdrivers?

00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:27.740
Um...

00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:32.240
All of this city was made with no screwdrivers?

00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:35.780
Boy, dealers in this city must be very interesting...

00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:38.560
So they agree to let them do the revolution-

00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:41.280
(I mean, they are just frigging rats...)

00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:43.060
-and to stop them in the middle of it.

00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:47.680
King: We'll replace the flask of elixir with a false one which will be full of water.

00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:49.560
"Joe": I'm ready to serve, Your Majesty!

00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:51.160
King: We must prepare for battle.

00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:53.000
"Joe":  All we have to do is win.

00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:57.780
Critic: You've made everyone dumber for saying that...

00:17:58.900 --> 00:18:02.620
So they help then get the fake elixir, but the Atlanteans are there to head them off.

00:18:07.660 --> 00:18:09.480
WHOA! SMILE'S PACKING!

00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:13.060
(Imitating the dog)
I'm sending you all to Doggy Hell! Ya hear me?

00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:16.880
DOGGY HELL! WHICH WE JUST CLARIFIED EXISTS!

00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:18.200
Merman: Attack!

00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:22.480
Critic: Wow, look at all those ships!

00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:25.460
And not one screwdriver was used on any of them.

00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:27.820
A lil' spit and mud goes a long way.

00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:32.960
So all the toys are marching into battle, when somebody spots a little girl doll in the army.

00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:34.680
King: A little girl?

00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:40.120
Little one, I appreciate your effort, but this is no place for someone like you...

00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:41.580
What is your name, my child?

00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:43.360
Commander: For the love of broken bagpipes!

00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:45.200
Critic: Whaaaaaaaaat?

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:46.220
Commander: I'm not a little girl!

00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:48.760
I'm the commander of the mountain artillery troops.

00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:50.760
It's a curse, not a disguise.

00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:54.300
I'm dolled up like this because I fell into the hands of a little girl,

00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:57.680
Who thought she'd put a wig on me when she saw me with this skirt on.

00:18:57.680 --> 00:18:58.760
Your Majesty!

00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:00.300
Critic: Don't come near me!

00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:05.420
Commander: Let me fight! I have to banish this curse that's haunting me and regain my identity!

00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:10.900
Critic: Okay...umm...

00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:12.840
Some notes.

00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:16.600
How is a little girl dressing you up a curse?

00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:18.960
It's just a little girl dressing you up.

00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:20.520
There's no supernatural elements.

00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:25.180
Second, why don't you just take the wig off, along with the makeup?

00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:28.100
In fact, you're underwater! How the hell does it stay on, anyway?

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:29.900
Yeah, like that!

00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:31.000
You just did it!

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.000
You took it off like it was nothing!

00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:36.500
Does that mean the curse is gone now?

00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:41.120
Whatever weird curse you think your Parker Brothers Ouija Board gave you?

00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:43.800
King: From now on, you have a new leader.

00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:45.500
A new general.

00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:47.500
The general Broomolli!

00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:49.020
Critic: And I'm not even kidding,

00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:52.400
This character. Never. Comes. Back!

00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:56.520
The strange backstory, the curse, the nonsensical story arc.

00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:59.700
None of it plays a part in anything.

00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:02.860
It was 100% pointless!

00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:05.980
Well, thank you for that.

00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:11.760
Whenever somebody brings up a Scottish toy who fought in the war, who was cursed to look like a little girl,

00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:15.040
but fired a cannon, lifting the curse and promoting him to general,

00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:17.860
I still won't reference you.

00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:22.340
So they zap the bad guy's ship with some sort of forgetting ray-

00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:24.060
Okay...

00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:27.760
And the bad guy totally forgets his plan.

00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:30.640
Or if he ever had any at all.

00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:32.180
Yeah, what was his scheme?

00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:35.160
Evarard: Jeffery, tell me, what was happening?

00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:39.120
Thus the rats also find out that the elixir they got isn't the real elixir,

00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:43.260
As they test it on this old man whom they tie to bricks and try to drown

00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:49.620
You know, I'm starting to think these were the rats Nimh flushed down the toilet...

00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:53.620
Elderly Rat: Fix them so that they'll never hurt anyone again!

00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:56.060
Critic: AAAHH! What was that!?

00:20:57.480 --> 00:21:00.440
Why was there a random shot of Pinkthulu there?

00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:04.460
Was it a subliminal message letting us know the film is always watching us?

00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:07.400
JESUS DIED IN VAIN!

00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:08.920
Counselor: We've won! We're the best!

00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:13.380
And as a reward to our heroes, they clean up and put together the Titanic.

00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:16.580
Yeah, remember that? The title of the goddamn movie?

00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:18.360
Merman: We finished, Your Exellency!

00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:20.480
Critic: (Imitating Merman)
Complete with dead bodies and everything.

Counselor: Cmon, Screwy!

00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:27.100
Critic: WAIT A MINUTE! HE'S WITH A SCREWDRIVER! I THOUGHT THEY WERE OUTLAWED!

00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:30.080
In fact, the screwdriver can talk, too!

00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:34.100
Yeah, it can think. It can make choices. It can do anything just like all the other things!

00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:36.920
That...That makes it kinda worse!

00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:41.820
They outlawed an entire group of people just for existing?

00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:44.740
THAT'S AMERICA'S JOB!

00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:52.000
So they take this ship and our heroes to the Isle of Naboomboo where they say they'll live the rest of their immortal lives.

00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:54.260
Umm...Sweet?

00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:58.160
King: This is a secret island, unreachable by anyone,

00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:00.360
and here you will live happily ever after.

00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:08.840
Critic: Thanks again for kidnapping us, forcing us to live forever, having us fight in your wars, and dropping us off on a deserted island!

00:22:09.220 --> 00:22:12.020
Ah, thank god we have no friends back home...

00:22:13.340 --> 00:22:15.520
And that was "The Search for Titanic".

00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:18.620
By far, the worst of the movies!

00:22:18.620 --> 00:22:21.300
Not because of how historically insensitive it is,

00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:23.280
(You could claim the others are worse for that)

00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:30.680
But just for what a poorly made, nonsensical, totally mad collection of ravings it is.

00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:33.360
The imagery in this film is beyond bonkers,

00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:40.920
And the reasons for the imagery are the invitation to a dark hallway of insanity I wouldn't wish upon my worst enemy.

00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:43.460
It is beyond words. It is a sickness.

00:22:43.460 --> 00:22:48.380
It is the worst in the animated musical Titanic trilogy.

00:22:48.380 --> 00:22:52.820
And I am so sad we live in a world where that's a thing!

00:22:52.820 --> 00:22:55.280
Holy Goddamn Hell!

00:22:56.320 --> 00:23:00.540
For this movie is an infection, and let me tell you, it's infected me.

00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:03.760
And it's gonna take a long time to get rid of it!

And I will survive!

You know, it's funny.

00:23:56.660 --> 00:24:00.620
In the end, all I had to do was think of people less fortunate than me.

00:24:00.620 --> 00:24:02.620
That, somehow, just cleared everything up.

00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:05.300
Just thinking of people less fortunate than me...

Cricket: It's not that I'm ashamed of the name "Cricket Lee",

I thought it would be a show about a cartoon insect who studies kung fu.
