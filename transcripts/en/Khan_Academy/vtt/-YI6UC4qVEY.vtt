00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:03.240
I think it's pretty common
knowledge how to find the area

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.030
of the triangle if we know the
length of its base

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:07.250
and its height.

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:10.540
So, for example, if that's my
triangle, and this length right

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:14.910
here-- this base-- is of length
b and the height right here is

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.080
of length h, it's pretty common
knowledge that the area of this

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.170
triangle is going to be equal
to 1/2 times the base

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:24.440
times the height.

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:30.240
So, for example, if the base
was equal to 5 and the height

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:37.180
was equal to 6, then our area
would be 1/2 times 5 times 6,

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.770
which is 1/2 times 30--
which is equal to 15.

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:45.120
Now what is less well-known is
how to figure out the area of a

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.250
triangle when you're only given
the sides of the triangle.

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:49.740
When you aren't
given the height.

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:53.470
So, for example, how do
you figure out a triangle

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:55.570
where I just give you the
lengths of the sides.

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:00.530
Let's say that's side a, side
b, and side c. a, b, and c are

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:01.640
the lengths of these sides.

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.360
How do you figure that out?

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.270
And to do that we're
going to apply something

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:06.430
called Heron's Formula.

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.790
And I'm not going to
prove it in this video.

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:15.200
I'm going to prove it
in a future video.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.400
And really to prove it you
already probably have

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.720
the tools necessary.

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.480
It's really just the
Pythagorean theorem and

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.220
a lot of hairy algebra.

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.230
But I'm just going to show you
the formula now and how to

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:26.760
apply it, and then you'll
hopefully appreciate that it's

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.590
pretty simple and pretty
easy to remember.

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.660
And it can be a nice trick
to impress people with.

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:36.320
So Heron's Formula says first
figure out this third variable

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.640
S, which is essentially
the perimeter of this

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.660
triangle divided by 2.

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:45.810
a plus b plus c, divided by 2.

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.480
Then once you figure out S, the
area of your triangle-- of this

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:55.840
triangle right there-- is going
to be equal to the square root

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.710
of S-- this variable S right
here that you just calculated--

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:10.540
times S minus a, times S
minus b, times S minus c.

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:12.480
That's Heron's
Formula right there.

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.830
This combination.

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.130
Let me square it off for you.

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.700
So that right there
is Heron's Formula.

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.610
And if that looks a little bit
daunting-- it is a little bit

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.290
more daunting, clearly, than
just 1/2 times base

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:25.290
times height.

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.040
Let's do it with an actual
example or two, and actually

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.350
see this is actually
not so bad.

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.320
So let's say I have a triangle.

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.300
I'll leave the
formula up there.

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.460
So let's say I have a
triangle that has sides

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:44.920
of length 9, 11, and 16.

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.040
So let's apply Heron's Formula.

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.190
S in this situation is going to
be the perimeter divided by 2.

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:56.630
So 9 plus 11 plus
16, divided by 2.

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:00.430
Which is equal to 9 plus
11-- is 20-- plus 16 is

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.660
36, divided by 2 is 18.

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:09.430
And then the area by Heron's
Formula is going to be equal to

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:19.380
the square root of S-- 18--
times S minus a-- S minus 9.

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:27.790
18 minus 9, times 18 minus
11, times 18 minus 16.

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:38.200
And then this is equal to
the square root of 18

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:44.730
times 9 times 7 times 2.

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.340
Which is equal to-- let's
see, 2 times 18 is 36.

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:48.900
So I'll just
rearrange it a bit.

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:56.700
This is equal to the square
root of 36 times 9 times 7,

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:05.540
which is equal to the square
root of 36 times the square

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:09.330
root of 9 times the
square root of 7.

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:14.130
The square root
of 36 is just 6.

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:16.040
This is just 3.

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:17.750
And we don't deal with the
negative square roots,

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:19.920
because you can't have
negative side lengths.

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:23.460
And so this is going to
be equal to 18 times

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.120
the square root of 7.

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.060
So just like that, you saw it,
it only took a couple of

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.760
minutes to apply Heron's
Formula, or even less than

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.420
that, to figure out that the
area of this triangle

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:38.710
right here is equal to 18
square root of seven.

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:42.040
Anyway, hopefully you
found that pretty neat.
