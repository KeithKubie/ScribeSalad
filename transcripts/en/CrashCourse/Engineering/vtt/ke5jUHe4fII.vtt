00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640
Louis Pasteur once said that “fortune
favors the prepared mind” – and I think
many engineers would agree!

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.320
Tackling big challenges in engineering requires
having a good overview of the different fields.

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.160
We’ve covered many of them throughout
this series and each gives you different tools
for considering a problem.

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.840
But you also need a way to put all that knowledge
together to come up with a plan.

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.440
Engineering design will help you do just that.

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:31.520
[Theme Music]

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:36.960
Pasteur’s work focused on disease prevention,
and a huge part of that is having clean, drinkable water.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.200
Unfortunately, many people around the world
still don’t have access to safe water.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:47.500
And the US National Academy of Engineering
has made increasing that access one of its
grand challenges of the 21st century.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:52.540
Any solution to a problem this big will require
putting together lots of different engineering
techniques.

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:58.180
In practice, this requires making lots of
choices and engineering design can help
you make the right ones.

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:04.780
Only 2.5% of water on Earth is drinkable – the
rest is mostly ocean water, which is much too salty.

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.620
To access that water, you need to take out
the salt, a process called desalination.

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:15.600
We saw one way to do this when looking at
mass separation techniques like Reverse Osmosis,
sometimes called RO.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.800
On a large enough scale, RO can turn millions
of liters of seawater into freshwater every day.

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:25.100
In fact, you could set up a desalination plant
to do just that on an industrial scale.

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:30.600
But scaling up from a simple idea into a fully-fledged
plant requires some serious design work!

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.939
In industrial engineering, processes can get
complicated fast.

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:41.900
As usual, you have to keep track of the heat, mass transfer, and fluid mechanics for whatever you’re processing and how it reacts with materials in your equipment.

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.420
What’s more, every part will depend on another.

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.000
So it’s not enough to string some techniques
together to achieve your goal.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.080
Instead, you have to consider the process as
a whole and the entire flow from start to finish.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:02:01.540
That means thinking about how to get water to where
it needs to go, how to deal with waste, how to supply
energy to the facility, and even how your plant is laid out.

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.520
And of course, you’ll want to make everything
as efficient as possible!

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:11.600
It might seem overwhelming to try and tackle all
of this at once, which is why engineers use design
work to make sense of a complex process.

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.860
And usually, there’s a whole team of engineers
involved!

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.520
The goal is to map out a problem and find
ways to address its challenges systematically.

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:23.840
You also want to ensure the whole system
makes sense, and then test it to check that
it does what it’s designed to do.

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:29.000
The first stage is considering the main outcome
you want to achieve and what techniques you’ll
need to do it.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.400
The central process of a desalination plant
is using reverse osmosis on seawater.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:40.480
For example, by pushing the seawater through a
membrane, water coming out the other side is more
drinkable, while the salt gets left behind.

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.540
That sounds simple enough, but there are actually
a lot of steps hidden inside that idea.

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.380
First, you’ll need a way to get seawater
out of the ocean and into your machine.

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:54.480
You’ll also need a pump to drive the RO,
a way to power it, and some way to get rid
of the excess saltwater.

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:00.880
Introducing specific equipment to address
the needs of your process and then linking
them together is called design synthesis.

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:07.100
At this point, you’ll also have to start thinking
about where you can obtain the equipment, or
the materials and labor you’ll need to build it.

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:14.120
After talking with other engineers on your team, you
might discover that there’s a supplier who makes water
pumps that are already well suited for what you need.

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.900
But that’s no good if they’re too expensive!

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.400
Even in the early stages, it’s best to start getting
an idea of how much things are going to cost.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:26.460
As you add more pieces of hypothetical
equipment in the design synthesis stage,
it’s useful to keep a running total.

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:30.700
Spiraling costs might require you to redesign
or even abandon the project altogether!

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.800
That would be a shame, but it’s better to find out
early on, rather than halfway through construction.

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:39.480
We can assume that that’s not the case for
the pumps and water tanks you’ve added to
your design so far.

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:45.000
Let’s also assume the materials and labour
costs for building a custom RO unit also fall
within the budget.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.560
Finally, maybe you decide that the simplest way
to dispose of the excess saltwater is simply to
redirect it back to the sea through a pipe.

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:55.180
With the basics of your design in place, you’re
ready to start improving it.

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.420
Engineers don’t jump from design to construction
right away.

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:03.220
First, you’ll want to predict as much as
you can about the performance of your plant
to try and iron out the kinks.

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:07.820
In fact, a big part of designing is redesigning
based on what you find in this step

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:12.720
You can get a pretty good idea of how certain
parts will behave with some back-of-the-envelope
calculations.

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:20.720
As we saw in thermodynamics, simple equations like the maximum efficiency of a heat engine can give you an idea about the best possible performance you can expect.

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.880
But the details usually take a bit more work
to figure out.

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.480
If you wanted to estimate the efficiency of
the RO unit you’ve designed,

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:31.960
you could run a computer simulation to model its
performance with different concentrations of salt.

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:38.920
Computer modelling is often a cheaper way
of investigating how complex pieces of machinery
will behave, rather than building them outright.

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:41.900
Any problems you find can help you go back
and improve your design.

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:44.490
But Murphy’s Law rears its head here, too.

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:48.960
Even the best modelling won’t capture all
the real world behavior of your process.

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:53.500
Which is why, once you’re fairly certain
about your design, it’s time to move to
the bench scale.

00:04:53.500 --> 00:05:00.560
A bench-scale model is a simplified, physical
version of the process you want to put into practice –
small enough to fit on a lab bench.

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:08.620
Rather than processing thousands or millions
of liters of water, your bench-scale desalination unit will
probably only handle something like 10 liters at a time.

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:14.280
Replicating your design with smaller, cheaper
components lets you test the process from
start to finish at low cost.

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:20.320
At this stage, you might discover a critical
flaw – like your pump bringing up sand along
with the water!

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:24.040
Maybe that sand clogs the intake, so water
has trouble making it through the membrane.

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:27.540
Bench-scale setups help identify problems
like these where possible.

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:33.040
To handle the sand problem, you could add
an initial stage of filtering before the water
reaches the desalinator.

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:37.820
At this stage, environmental considerations
are also something you can’t afford to overlook.

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:43.520
Industrial processes often produce waste,
and it’s important to dispose of that in a way
that’s safe and responsible.

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:51.620
To avoid a pile of sand building up and blocking the output pipe, you need to arrange for it to be collected and transported elsewhere for agriculture or construction.

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:56.740
After adding a sand filter and making sure
it works on the bench scale, it’s time to
jump up another level.

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:00.380
You’re still not ready to build a full desalination
plant – but you’re getting closer!

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:05.490
Just because a process works on a small scale doesn’t
mean it will replicate perfectly as things get bigger.

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:07.800
Consider the efficiency of your RO unit.

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:13.580
It might turn out that the surface-area-to-volume
ratio of the membrane determines the system’s
efficiency.

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:17.100
Unfortunately, that quantity will change as
you enlarge the membrane.

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:23.280
Engineers call this situation non-linear scaling,
and it’s a big challenge when designing an
industrial process.

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:26.500
To account for issues like this, you’ll
want to move on to pilot scale.

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:33.720
The pilot-scale model is almost a replica
of your final plant, but usually only made to
handle 10-50% of its final capacity.

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:39.700
Some of the equipment might be the same
as what you eventually use, but you’ll want
enough flexibility to make changes.

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:48.000
When testing your pilot-scale system, for example, you
might find that the pump driving RO requires much more
energy than your bench-scale calculations suggested!

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:54.080
And maybe it’s so much energy that unless
you find a way to bring down energy costs,
it won’t be affordable to run the plant.

00:06:54.080 --> 00:07:01.570
At this point, you might realize that you can put a
power generating turbine in the pipe that channels
wastewater from the desalinator out to sea.

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:08.120
That turbine will allow you to recapture some
of the waste’s kinetic energy, reducing your plant’s
electricity needs and keeping costs down.

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:13.180
Once you’ve resolved all the issues on the pilot scale,
you’re ready to think about building the real thing!

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:19.460
Of course, knowing every part of your design
and knowing how to make every part of your
design are two very different things.

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:26.820
For instance, you might not be able to install
the RO unit until you work out exactly how far the
pipe pumping in the water needs to extend.

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:31.400
In general, the order you build things might not be
the same order as things happen in your process.

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:33.220
Which means you’ll need a construction plan.

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:37.800
Hopefully, you’ve been taking note of these
things when putting together your bench-scale
and pilot-scale versions,

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:41.060
which will inform how the final construction
of the plant should be carried out.

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:44.860
And once you know how it’s going to be made,
you’re finally set to actually build the thing!

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:47.140
But a good engineer’s job doesn’t end
there.

00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:51.220
Once your plant is up and running, new issues
might arise that need to be resolved.

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:55.940
Maybe the price of electricity spikes a few
years down the line, which threatens to shut
down production.

00:07:55.940 --> 00:08:04.420
But you find out that the cost of solar technology has
decreased in the meantime, which allows you to add a
solar farm to directly power the plant at a reduced cost.

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:10.640
After all that work, your plant will be capable
of safely and affordably delivering drinkable
water for everyone nearby.

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:18.500
In practice, a project of this size would require
dozens of engineers working together to tackle all
the necessary parts of the design process.

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:24.620
It’s a lot of effort, but being careful and
methodical in your planning gives you the best
odds for tackling the biggest problems.

00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:32.880
In this episode, we saw how design synthesis helps you
put together the components of a process and decide
what techniques are needed to solve your problem.

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:37.280
We saw the need to test things on a smaller
scale before ramping up to full production.

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:42.580
Finally we saw how to continually incorporate
feedback from design flaws to improve your designs.

00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:48.160
