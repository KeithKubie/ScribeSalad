You've probably heard of flashlights that never need batteries or replacement bulbs. This is too good to be true

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:10.250
[I] really [wanted] to know so today [I] decided to build my own

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.939
To start I bought an economy flashlight for a dollar [49] then I broke it down to its components

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:23.899
After removing the [parts]. I didn't need, I cut a piece of [1-inch] PVC pipe and wrapped it with insulated Magnet wire

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:28.818
Next [I] found a rubber bouncy ball and split it in half to plug the ends of the Tube

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:35.600
before sealing off the top I placed inside a three quarter inch by one inch neodymium rare-Earth Magnet [I]

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.400
Used an open flame from my barbecue igniter to remove the coating from the ends of the wires

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:44.359
Then I hooked the exposed ends to my multimeter to test it out

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:50.659
I was surprised that when I shook the tube it easily generated an alternating current of over four volts

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.300
To prevent damage to the rest of the wire coating I wrapped some packing tape twice around the Tube

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.040
This also helped keep the wire in place and keep the Tube snug in the casing

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.699
Next I drew up a schematic for the circuit. I would need and I went to work soldering and twisting wires in Place. [I]

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:10.509
Use a FULL BRIDGE Recifyer!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:14.209
I found on a junk circuit board to convert the Ac from the shaker directly to DC.

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:19.999
I Wired this to a five and a half volt one farad electrolytic capacitor that I found on the same board

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:27.110
Next I wired a rocker switch that I hoped would fit in the pre-existing switch hole and luckily it did

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.019
I Carefully packed all the components inside the casing and left just the two lead wires hanging out

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:40.400
For convenience in changing out future leds. [I] soldered an eight pin Ic socket to the positive and negative lead wires

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.959
Then I hot glued it to the underside of the reflector, and the fit couldn't have been better

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:51.949
To finish up I inserted a 10 millimeter white led that I got at Radioshack for about three dollars

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.290
I Screwed the cap back on and done my very own shake flashlight.

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.130
I Tested it out and was amazed at the results

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:06.019
Not only was the light bright, but for just 30 seconds of shaking [I] could use my light for over 10 minutes

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.589
Well, I guess that answers the question that yes

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.239
You can run a flashlight without batteries as long as you're willing to get a workout at the same time

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.789
That's another item for my emergency kit

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:22.370
And it was a lot of fun to make I hope you've enjoyed watching this video as much as I've enjoyed making it

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.590
Thanks for [watching]
