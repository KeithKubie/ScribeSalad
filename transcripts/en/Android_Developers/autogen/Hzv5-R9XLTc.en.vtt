Android jetpack already what we're doing
 

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:39.540
Android jetpack already what we're doing
is adding to it over time with stuff

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:39.550
is adding to it over time with stuff
 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:40.740
is adding to it over time with stuff
that's going to make it even better

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:40.750
that's going to make it even better
 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:42.690
that's going to make it even better
and we're also improving it over time

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:42.700
and we're also improving it over time

one of the major steps that we're taking
 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:46.950
one of the major steps that we're taking
is what I like to think of as a refactor

is what I like to think of as a refactor
 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.619
is what I like to think of as a refactor
because it's her refactor and we're

00:00:49.619 --> 00:00:49.629
because it's her refactor and we're
 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:51.090
because it's her refactor and we're
doing a whole lot of tedious renaming

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:51.100
doing a whole lot of tedious renaming
 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.130
doing a whole lot of tedious renaming
and we're also providing tools to make

looking at the bytecode generated by the
 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.030
looking at the bytecode generated by the
cutting compiler divinized some of the

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:45.040
cutting compiler divinized some of the
 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.530
cutting compiler divinized some of the
bytecode patterns that were different

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:46.540
bytecode patterns that were different
 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.090
bytecode patterns that were different
from the ones generated by the java

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100
from the ones generated by the java
 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.920
from the ones generated by the java
programming language compiler and they

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:49.930
programming language compiler and they
 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:51.690
programming language compiler and they
developed the optimizing for those

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700
developed the optimizing for those
 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.570
developed the optimizing for those
patterns we've also been adding a lot of

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:54.580
patterns we've also been adding a lot of
 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.450

nobility annotations to our java api is

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:57.460
nobility annotations to our java api is
 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.090
nobility annotations to our java api is
both in the core libraries so lib core

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100
both in the core libraries so lib core
 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.280
both in the core libraries so lib core
and our support libraries to make it

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:02.290
and our support libraries to make it
 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:04.380
and our support libraries to make it
easier for you to use the platform api

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390
easier for you to use the platform api
 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:05.970
easier for you to use the platform api
so when you're when you're in catalan

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:05.980
so when you're when you're in catalan
 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:08.609
so when you're when you're in catalan
and finally we launched on github a new

cutting extensions for existing platform
 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.570
cutting extensions for existing platform
API and the goal here is to try to take

API and the goal here is to try to take
 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:16.830
API and the goal here is to try to take
advantage of some of the cutting

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840
advantage of some of the cutting
 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.720
advantage of some of the cutting
language features to make existing API

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730
language features to make existing API
 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:20.430
language features to make existing API
is easier to use they're already easier

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440
is easier to use they're already easier
 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.590
is easier to use they're already easier
to use just by using cotton but with the

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600
to use just by using cotton but with the
 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:23.910
