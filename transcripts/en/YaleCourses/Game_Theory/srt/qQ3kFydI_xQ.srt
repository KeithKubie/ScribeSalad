1
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:06,000
Okay. So last time we looked
at and played this game,

2
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:10,440
you have to choose grades as you,
so you have to choose alpha and Beta.

3
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:14,940
And this table told us what
outcome would arise in particular,

4
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:19,500
what grade you would get and what grade
your pair would get. So for example,

5
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:22,890
if you'd chosen visa and
your pad shows an Alpha,

6
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,980
then you would get a c and
your path would get an a.

7
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:30,480
And one of the first things we pointed
out is that this is not quite a game yet.

8
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,680
It's missing something.
This has outcomes and it's,

9
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:40,200
it's an outcome
may tricks,

10
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:44,670
but it doesn't the game because
per game we need to know payoffs.

11
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:49,080
Okay? And then we looked at some
possible payoffs and now it is a game.

12
00:00:49,081 --> 00:00:53,250
So this is a game is to give you some
more jargon. This is a normal form game.

13
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:58,790
And here we've assumed the payoffs are
those that arise if players only care

14
00:00:59,251 --> 00:01:02,130
about their own grades,
which I think was true for a lot of you,

15
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:04,170
it wasn't true for the gentleman.
He's sitting there now.

16
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:06,390
But it was true for a lot of people.
All right,

17
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:11,070
and when pointed out that in this game,
Alpha strictly dominates pizza.

18
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:14,370
What do we mean by that? We mean
that no, if these are your pay offs,

19
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:16,560
no matter what your pair does,

20
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:21,330
you attain a higher payoff from
choosing Alpha than you do from choosing

21
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,220
[inaudible].
Right?

22
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:27,120
Let's focus a couple of lessons of the
class before I come back to this one

23
00:01:27,121 --> 00:01:32,121
lesson was do not play a
strictly dominated strategy ever.

24
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,640
I remember that lesson and then much
later on when we looked at some more

25
00:01:35,641 --> 00:01:39,990
complicated payoffs and a more complicated
game, we looked at a different lesson,

26
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:40,980
which was this,

27
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:46,350
put yourself in others shoes to try and
figure out what they're going to do.

28
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:47,910
All right,
so in fact,

29
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:51,210
what we learned from that is it doesn't
just matter what your pay offs to other.

30
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:52,260
That's obviously important.

31
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:56,640
It's also important what other people's
pay offs are because you want to try and

32
00:01:56,641 --> 00:02:01,110
figure out what they're gonna do and
then respond appropriately. All right,

33
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:05,610
so we're going to return to both
of these lessons today, right?

34
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,280
Both these bathrooms will reoccur today.

35
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:11,190
Now a lot of today is going
to be fairly abstract,

36
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:16,370
so I just want to remind you that game
theory has some real world relevance,

37
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,230
and again,
it's done in the interest of recapping.

38
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:23,310
This particular game is called the
prisoner's dilemma. It's written there,

39
00:02:23,311 --> 00:02:28,190
the prisoner's dilemma. All right, let's
just, it's prisoners, plural, and I,

40
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,060
we mentioned two examples last time.

41
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:33,480
Let me just reiterate and mentioned some
more examples which actually written

42
00:02:33,481 --> 00:02:36,930
here so they'll find their way
into your notes. So for example,

43
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,870
if you have a joint project
that you're working on,

44
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,550
perhaps it's a homework assignment,

45
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:45,480
or perhaps it's a video project like
these guys that can turn into a prisoner's

46
00:02:45,481 --> 00:02:50,100
dilemma. Why? Because each individual
might have an incentive to shirk.

47
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,490
All right?
Price competition.

48
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:58,200
Two firms competing with one another
in prices can have a prisoner's dilemma

49
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:01,300
aspects about it. Why? Because
no matter how the other,

50
00:03:01,301 --> 00:03:03,190
from your competitor prices,

51
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:07,750
you might have an incentive to undercut
them if both firms behave that way,

52
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:11,110
prices will get driven down
towards marginal costs at industry.

53
00:03:11,111 --> 00:03:13,540
Profits will suffer in the first case.

54
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:17,550
If everyone shirks you end up with a
bad product. In the second case, if,

55
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:20,020
if both firms undercut each other,

56
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:24,220
you end up with low prices that actually
good for consumers, but bad for firms,

57
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:29,050
and let me mention a third
example. Suppose there's a
common resource out there.

58
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:33,720
Maybe it's a fish dock or maybe
it's the atmosphere, right?

59
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:36,220
There's a prisoner's
dilemma aspect to this too.

60
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:39,640
You might have an incentive to overfish.
Why?

61
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:42,610
Because if the other countries with
this fish stock and see the fish Tacos,

62
00:03:42,611 --> 00:03:47,080
the Atlantic, if the other countries
are going to fish as normal,

63
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:52,140
you may as well may as well fish as normal
too and at the other countries aren't

64
00:03:52,391 --> 00:03:54,220
going to cut down on their fishing.

65
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,600
Then you want to catch the fish now
because there aren't going to be any there

66
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,000
tomorrow.
Right.

67
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:02,890
Another example of this referral would
be global warming and carbon emissions.

68
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:03,430
Again,

69
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:06,730
leaving aside the science about which
I'm sure some of you know more than me

70
00:04:06,731 --> 00:04:10,690
here, the the issue of carbon
emissions is a prisoner's dilemma.

71
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:15,640
Each of us individually has an incentive
to it to emit carbons as usual. Right?

72
00:04:15,641 --> 00:04:19,510
If everyone else is cutting down item have
to and if everyone else does cut down,

73
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,740
I don't have to. I end up using hot water
and driving a big car and so on. Right?

74
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:27,040
In each of these cases we
end up with a bad outcome,

75
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:28,960
so this is socially important.

76
00:04:28,961 --> 00:04:32,440
It is not just some abstract thing going
on in the class and Yale and we know we

77
00:04:32,441 --> 00:04:34,060
need to think about solutions to this.

78
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:37,060
Right from the start of the class and
we already talked about something,

79
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:41,950
we pointed out that this is not
just a failure of communication,

80
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:47,110
right? Communication per se will not
get you out of a prisoner's dilemma.

81
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:49,030
You can talk about it as much as you like,

82
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:52,510
but as long as you're going to go home
and still drive your hammer and have six

83
00:04:52,511 --> 00:04:55,630
16 hot showers a day, we're still
going to have high carbon emissions.

84
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:59,560
You can talk about working hard
on your joint problem set, right,

85
00:04:59,561 --> 00:05:03,160
but as long as you go home and don't
work hard, it doesn't help. All right.

86
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,130
In fact, if the other person is working
hard or is cutting back on their carbon

87
00:05:06,131 --> 00:05:07,120
emissions,
you have every,

88
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:11,050
every bit more incentive to not work
hard or keyboard high carbon emissions

89
00:05:11,051 --> 00:05:14,800
yourself. So we need something more
and kind of things. We can see more,

90
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:19,060
we can think about contracts, we can
think about treaties between countries.

91
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,800
We can think about regulation.

92
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:25,090
All of these things work
by changing the payoffs,

93
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:26,500
not just talking about it,

94
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:30,880
but actually changing the outcomes
actually and changing the payoffs, right?

95
00:05:30,881 --> 00:05:35,080
Changing the incentives, right? And
important. Another thing we can do,

96
00:05:35,081 --> 00:05:38,680
very important thing is we can think
about changing the game into a game of

97
00:05:38,681 --> 00:05:42,280
repeated interaction and seeing how
much that helps and we'll come back and

98
00:05:42,281 --> 00:05:46,390
revisit that later in the class. And
one last thing we could think of doing,

99
00:05:46,391 --> 00:05:47,800
but we have to be a bit careful here,

100
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:50,740
is we could think about changing
the payoffs by education.

101
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,410
I think of that as the Maoists strategy,
right?

102
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,710
Lock people up in classrooms and tell
them how to be better people that may or

103
00:05:56,711 --> 00:05:59,470
may not work and not optimistic, but
at least it's the same idea. What?

104
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,350
Changing payoffs.

105
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:01,830
Okay.

106
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:05,120
All right, so that's
enough for, uh, for recap.

107
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:10,660
I want to move on now and in particular
we left you hanging at the end last time

108
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:17,450
we played a game at the very end last
time where each of you shows a number.

109
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:18,320
All right?

110
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:21,350
All of you chose a number and we said
the window was going to be the person who

111
00:06:21,351 --> 00:06:23,660
gets closer to two thirds
of the average in the class.

112
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,040
Now we've figured that out.

113
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:28,190
We figured out who the winner is and I
knew what all of you have or trying to

114
00:06:28,191 --> 00:06:31,700
see if you want. Is that right? And I'm
going to leave you in suspense. Okay?

115
00:06:31,701 --> 00:06:32,840
So I'm going to tell you today,

116
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:35,780
why don't we did figure it
out and we'll get there.

117
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,420
But I want to do a little
bit of work first. All right?

118
00:06:38,421 --> 00:06:40,790
So just going to leave it in suspense.
That'll stop you walking out early.

119
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:42,200
If you want win,
win the prize.

120
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:44,420
All right.

121
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:51,210
So do me, lots of times in this
class, when we get to play games,

122
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:53,610
we get to have classroom
discussions and so on.

123
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:58,050
But there's gotta be some times when
we have to slow down and do some work.

124
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:01,110
And the next 20 minutes are
going to be that. All right?

125
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:03,930
So with apologies for being a
bit more boring for 20 minutes,

126
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:08,790
let's do something we'll call formal stuff

127
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:12,713
in particular.

128
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:17,040
I wanted to develop and make sure we
all understand what are the ingredients,

129
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:19,800
what are the ingredients?

130
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:23,783
All the game.

131
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:27,380
All right?
So in particular,

132
00:07:27,381 --> 00:07:31,080
we need to figure out what formerly make
something into a game and the formal

133
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:35,580
parts of a game of this.
We need players.

134
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:39,900
All right? And while we're here,
let's develop some notation.

135
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:43,350
So the standard notation,
the players,

136
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,910
I'm going to use things like
little I and little j. All right?

137
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:49,650
So in that numbers game,
the game,

138
00:07:49,651 --> 00:07:53,490
when all of you wrote down a number and
handed it in, at the end of last time,

139
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:58,210
the players were who hires were you,
right? You all with the players, right?

140
00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:00,630
Useful texts and expression.
Meaning you plural.

141
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:05,870
Right? And the numbers game, we
give him something more on the here

142
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:08,570
and the numbers game

143
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:14,670
you will with a players.
All right.

144
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:18,800
Second Ingredient took the game.
Ela Strategies.

145
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:26,070
That's a good clue here. If I'm writing,
you should be writing. Okay. Strategies.

146
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:30,520
All right, notation. All right,
so I'm going to use little s,

147
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:33,900
little SSI to be a particular,

148
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:37,680
can I
strategy

149
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:41,850
off player I

150
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:49,320
particular strategy of player I so an
example in that game might have been

151
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:54,940
choosing the number 13 all
right, everyone understand that?

152
00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:01,280
Now I need to distinguish this from the
set of possible Spanish is of player I.

153
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:05,490
So I'm going to use
capital SSI to be what?

154
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:08,130
To be to be the set,

155
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:15,000
the set, all alternatives. The
set of possible strategies.

156
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:20,043
Yeah.

157
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:21,140
Oh,
of player I.

158
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:28,250
So in that game we played at the end last
time. What were the set of strategies?

159
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:31,850
They were the set one,
two,

160
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:37,060
three all the way up to 100 all right.

161
00:09:37,581 --> 00:09:41,870
So I'm distinguishing APP
ticket, a strategy from the
set of possible strategies.

162
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:45,260
And while we're here,
I want a third mutation for strategy.

163
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:50,090
I'm going to use little s without
an eye. All right? No subscripts,

164
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:54,710
but less without an eye to mean
a particular play of the game.

165
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,313
Yeah,

166
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:01,030
particular play.

167
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,190
Okay.

168
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:09,520
Oh, of the game. So what do I mean
by that? All of you at the end,

169
00:10:09,521 --> 00:10:12,760
last time wrote down this
number and handed the man's,

170
00:10:12,761 --> 00:10:15,940
we had one number per one strategy choice,

171
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:20,140
pepper for each player and each
person in the class. So here they are.

172
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:25,060
Here's my, uh, collected in
instead of strategy choices,

173
00:10:25,061 --> 00:10:27,130
here's the bumble bits of
paper you hand in last time.

174
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:30,100
This is a particular play of the game.
All right,

175
00:10:30,101 --> 00:10:32,860
I've got you the person's name and
I've got a number from each person.

176
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:36,340
A strategy from each person.
All right?

177
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,110
We actually have it on
a spreadsheet as well.

178
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:41,390
So here it is written out in a
spreadsheet, right? Each of you, each,

179
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:44,710
your name is on the spreadsheet and
the number you chose. All right?

180
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,460
So that's a particular player of the game.
And that has a different name.

181
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:50,560
We sometimes call this

182
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:55,810
a strategy profile.

183
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,160
So you're in the textbook.

184
00:10:57,610 --> 00:11:01,420
You'll sometimes see the term a strategy
profile or a strategy backdoor strategy

185
00:11:01,421 --> 00:11:01,721
list.

186
00:11:01,721 --> 00:11:05,710
It doesn't really matter what is saying
is one strategy for each player in the

187
00:11:05,711 --> 00:11:09,040
game. All right? So in the numbers game,

188
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:12,100
this is the spreadsheet.

189
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:15,100
One example of this.

190
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:17,240
Yes, the spreadsheet, right?

191
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:20,850
How does that make sense?

192
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:23,180
You can still see that I'm
going to pull down these boards,

193
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,053
okay.

194
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:31,930
And let me clean something.

195
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:40,020
So you might think what Don,
right, we've got a players,

196
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:43,230
we've got the choices they could make.
That's their strategy sense.

197
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:47,010
We've got those individual strategies
and we've got the choices they actually

198
00:11:47,011 --> 00:11:49,260
did make.
That's the strategy profile.

199
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:51,660
Seems like we've got everything you
could possibly want to describe. Again,

200
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:56,350
what are we missing here?
Say shout it out. Pay Offs.

201
00:11:56,351 --> 00:11:59,140
We're missing payoffs, right?
So to complete the game

202
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:00,863
we need,

203
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:07,370
we need payoffs. Alright. And again,
I need to Taishan the payoffs.

204
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:11,960
So in this course I'll try and
use you for you tile to be player.

205
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:14,450
Eyes playoff. All right? So you,

206
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:17,810
I will depend on play a one's choice.

207
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:23,080
All the way to play eyes own choice
all the way out to play at EMS choices,

208
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:25,840
right? So, uh,

209
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:30,440
plant eyes off the Ui depends on all
the choices in the class in this case,

210
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:32,330
including his own choice.

211
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:37,480
And of course a shorter way of writing
that would be Ui s it depends on the

212
00:12:38,451 --> 00:12:43,310
profile. All right, so in
the numbers game, what is,

213
00:12:43,311 --> 00:12:45,560
this is a numbers game.

214
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:48,440
Ui of ass can be two things.

215
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:50,510
It can be

216
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:54,990
$5 minus your era in pennies

217
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:57,750
if you won.

218
00:12:58,290 --> 00:13:01,940
I guess it can be something as it was
a tie went by the writing that now and

219
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:04,440
it's going to be zero otherwise.

220
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:08,643
All right,

221
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:14,690
so we've now got all of the ingredients,
the game players, strategists,

222
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:17,570
payoffs.
All right,

223
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:23,000
now we're going to make an assumption
today and for the next 10 weeks or so.

224
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:25,460
All right, so, but almost all the class,

225
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:28,640
we're going to assume
that these are known.

226
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:31,690
Yeah,

227
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:36,160
we're going to assume that everybody knows
the possible strategies everyone else

228
00:13:36,161 --> 00:13:40,630
could choose and everyone
knows everyone else's payoffs.

229
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,890
Now that's not a very realistic assumption
and we are going to come back and

230
00:13:44,891 --> 00:13:46,210
challenge it at the end of the semester.

231
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:49,840
But this will be complicated enough to
get us a lot of material in the next 10

232
00:13:49,841 --> 00:13:53,530
weeks.
I need one more piece of notation

233
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:57,730
and then we can get
back to having some fun.

234
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:02,550
So one more piece of mutation.

235
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:08,690
I'm going to write x minus I to mean
what it's going to mean a strategy choice

236
00:14:10,651 --> 00:14:15,570
for everybody except person I it's gonna
be useful to have that rotation around.

237
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:17,490
All right,
so this is,

238
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:19,943
this is

239
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:21,450
hey,
choice

240
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:24,090
for all.

241
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:25,790
Excellent.

242
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:27,880
Yeah,

243
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,230
person I apply.

244
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:34,270
So in particular if you're person
one than that and then s minus,

245
00:14:34,271 --> 00:14:38,650
I would be s two s three s four up to sn,
but it wouldn't include as one.

246
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:42,280
All right. It's useful. Why?

247
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:45,540
Because sometimes it's useful
to think about the payoffs.

248
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:50,630
I was coming from his own choice
and everyone else's choices.

249
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:56,360
It's just a useful way of
thinking about things. All right.

250
00:14:56,990 --> 00:15:01,730
Now this one I want to stop for a second
and I know that some of you from past

251
00:15:01,731 --> 00:15:04,460
experience are somewhat math phobic.

252
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:07,490
You do not have to wave your hands
in the air if your math phobic.

253
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:12,350
But since some of you are, let me just
get your water, take a deep breath.

254
00:15:12,351 --> 00:15:15,050
This goes to people who are
math phobic at home, too high.

255
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:19,130
So everyone's like a slight panic.
Now you know you came here today,

256
00:15:19,131 --> 00:15:21,770
your thought everything's gonna be fine.
Now I'm putting math on the board.

257
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:24,950
All right, take a deep breath. It's
not that hard. And in particular,

258
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,810
notice that all in doing here
is writing down mutation.

259
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,040
It's actually no math
going on here at all.

260
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:35,930
I'm just developing notation and I don't
want anybody to quit this class cause

261
00:15:35,931 --> 00:15:37,760
they worried about math or math notation.

262
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:40,820
So if you are in that category of somebody
who might quit it because of that,

263
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:43,820
come and talk to me. Come and talk to
the AES. We will get you through it.

264
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:47,720
All right? It's fine to be math phobic.
I'm, I'm phobic of all sorts of things.

265
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:50,600
All right? Not necessarily math,
but all sorts of things. All right,

266
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:54,620
so serious thing. A lot of people get put
off meditation. It looks scary. That is,

267
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:58,640
there's nothing going on here except
for the station at this point.

268
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:04,880
All right, so let's have an
example to help us fix some ideas.

269
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:09,410
And again, I'll have to clean
the boards. So give me a second.

270
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:20,220
I think an example might help those
people who are disturbed by the mutation.

271
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:23,090
Yeah.

272
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:24,110
So here's a game

273
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:32,490
which we're going to discuss briefly.
It involves two players

274
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,480
and we'll call the players.
One.

275
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:40,650
I'm two and play a one has two choices,

276
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:45,600
top and bottom,
and play a two has three choices,

277
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:50,840
left center and right.
All right.

278
00:16:50,841 --> 00:16:52,860
And so spray simple
abstract example for now.

279
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,630
And let's suppose the
payoffs are like this,

280
00:16:54,631 --> 00:16:57,890
they're not particularly interesting.
We're just gonna do it for the purpose of,

281
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:02,460
of, of a illustration.
Here are the payoffs.

282
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:07,550
Five minus 1300640220.

283
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:16,560
All right, let's just map the notation
we just developed into this game.

284
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:21,050
Okay. So first of all, who
are the players here? Alright,

285
00:17:21,090 --> 00:17:24,380
well there's no secret there. The
players are just writing down what, wait,

286
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:27,660
why don't we,
the players here in this game,

287
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:31,710
our player one and player two.
All right,

288
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,410
what about the strategy sets?

289
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:40,190
What about the strategy sense or the
strategy? Alternatives? All right,

290
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:44,670
so here, player ones, strategy set,

291
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:48,480
she has two choices.
Top,

292
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,560
well bottom represented by the
rows which are healthfully,

293
00:17:52,561 --> 00:17:56,820
the top row and the bottom row right?
And play a two.

294
00:17:58,060 --> 00:17:58,370
Okay.

295
00:17:58,370 --> 00:18:01,820
Has to, Cha has three choices,
right? This game is not symmetric,

296
00:18:01,821 --> 00:18:04,220
so they have different numbers
of traces that spine play.

297
00:18:04,221 --> 00:18:06,380
A two has three choices,

298
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:11,470
left center and right represented by
the left center and right column in the

299
00:18:13,071 --> 00:18:16,490
Matrix. And just to point
out, in passing up to now,

300
00:18:16,491 --> 00:18:18,680
we've been looking mostly
at symmetric games.

301
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:21,440
Notice this game is not symmetric
and the payoffs or in the strategies,

302
00:18:21,441 --> 00:18:26,000
there's no particular reason why games
have to be symmetric and pay offs.

303
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:32,120
All right, so again, this is not
rocket science, but let's do it anyway.

304
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:34,430
So just an example of payoffs.

305
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:39,730
So player one's payoff if she chooses
top and play a to choose his sensor.

306
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:47,500
We read by looking at the top row and
the center column and play a ones pay off

307
00:18:47,561 --> 00:18:52,350
is the first of these payoffs.
So it's 11. All right.

308
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:57,570
And play a Tuesday off from the
same choices. Top four player,

309
00:18:57,571 --> 00:18:59,970
one center for player too.
Again,

310
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:03,360
we go along the top row and the
center column. But this time,

311
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:06,000
which you'd pay a Tuesday,
offer to the second pay off.

312
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:10,600
Sorry. It's three. Okay.

313
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:12,311
All right.
So again,

314
00:19:12,311 --> 00:19:15,310
I'm hoping that he's calming down
the math phobics in the room.

315
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:18,520
Now how do we think this
game is gonna be played?

316
00:19:18,521 --> 00:19:20,770
There's no particular interesting
game at while we're here.

317
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:23,830
Why don't we just discuss it for
a second. All right, so if the,

318
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:26,380
if our make guys get a little
bit ready here. All right,

319
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:29,930
so how do we think this
game should be played? Ah,

320
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:34,320
well let's ask, uh, uh, somebody
at random, at perhaps hourly.

321
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:38,070
Do you want to ask, uh, this guy in
the blue shirt here, right? Uh, does,

322
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:42,010
does play a one here. Just play
a one. Have a dominated strategy.

323
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:46,130
Alright. No player one doesn't have
a dominated strategy. For instance,

324
00:19:46,131 --> 00:19:50,990
if a player two picks left and
player one wants to pick bottom,

325
00:19:50,991 --> 00:19:55,250
but if Claire to pick center player one
wants to pick center. Good. Very good.

326
00:19:55,251 --> 00:19:55,540
I should let

327
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:59,130
you stand up. I forgot that.
Never mind. But that was very
clear. Thank you. And, and,

328
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:01,810
and was that loud enough? People
are to hear it. Do people hear that?

329
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:06,010
People in the back, you hear it. So even
that wasn't loud enough. Okay. So we need,

330
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:08,530
we really need to get people to,
that was very clear and very nice.

331
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:11,170
Will you want to stand up and shout?
All the people at the back can't hear.

332
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:16,350
So what I'm gonna do on your
name is Patrick and Patrick
said was no play at one

333
00:20:16,571 --> 00:20:18,610
does not have a dominator strategy.

334
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:22,870
Top is better than bottom
against left cause. Sorry.

335
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:25,810
Bottom is better than top against
laugh because six is bigger than five.

336
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:29,560
But top is better than bottom against
center because 11 is bigger than zero.

337
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:33,010
Everyone see that? Alright,
so it's not the case.

338
00:20:33,011 --> 00:20:36,040
That top always beats is not the top,

339
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:41,080
always does better than bottom or that
bottom always does better than top. Okay.

340
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:45,460
What about a bit raised hands this time?
What about player to just play a,

341
00:20:45,461 --> 00:20:47,020
to have a dominated,

342
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:53,710
everyone's keeping their hands firmly
down so as not to get spotted here.

343
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:56,310
Should we, we uh, yeah.

344
00:20:56,311 --> 00:21:00,830
Should we try a I like can we try this
guy and why you want to stand up and wait

345
00:21:00,831 --> 00:21:05,020
for and against that and
really yell it out now louder

346
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:10,170
I believe right is a dominant strategy
because of player one chooses top. Uh,

347
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:13,240
then player two will choose center.

348
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:18,880
And if or I'm getting confused
now it looks better on my
paper, but yeah, at play,

349
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:20,950
right is never the best choice.

350
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:25,980
Okay, good. Good. Let's be a
little bit careful here. So
your name is Thomas Thomas.

351
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:27,930
So Thomas said something which was true,

352
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:31,890
but it doesn't quite match with the
definition of a domination strategy.

353
00:21:31,891 --> 00:21:36,000
What Thomas stayed was right is
never a best choice. That's true.

354
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:40,740
That's true. All right. But
to be a domination strategy,
we need something else.

355
00:21:40,741 --> 00:21:41,221
We need that.

356
00:21:41,221 --> 00:21:46,221
There's another strategy of a play or two
that always does better right now that

357
00:21:47,131 --> 00:21:49,780
have turned out to be true in this
game, but it's a seat. All right,

358
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:54,810
so in this particular game,
I claim that sensor dominates,

359
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:57,090
right? Which center dominates, right?

360
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:02,360
Just to see that if play a one
shows top sensa yields free,

361
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:05,520
right?
Yield zero three is bigger than zero,

362
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:08,250
and if player one chooses bottom,

363
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:13,550
then center yields to right yields
zero two is bigger than zero again.

364
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:18,900
So in this game sensor strictly
dominates, right? All right,

365
00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:19,980
well what you said was true,

366
00:22:19,981 --> 00:22:24,810
but I wanted to tell me specifically about
about a domination here. All right, so,

367
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,040
uh,
what we know here,

368
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:30,840
we know that player to should
not shoes should not choose,

369
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:32,730
right?
All right.

370
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,570
Now that's as far as we can
get with dominance arguments
in this particular game.

371
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,020
But nevertheless, let's just stick
with it a second. I gave you the door,

372
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:45,030
I gave you the definition of strict
dominance last time and it's also on the

373
00:22:45,031 --> 00:22:47,010
handout by the way,
the hand out on the web.

374
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,990
But let me write that definition again.

375
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:52,350
Using or making use of the
mutation from the class.

376
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:57,700
So definition. All right. So player,

377
00:22:57,730 --> 00:23:01,000
I play an eyes

378
00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:03,880
strategy.

379
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:07,140
Yes.
Nicholi prime.

380
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:14,040
All right.
Is strictly

381
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:19,290
dominated by

382
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:22,860
play eyes.

383
00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:24,723
Okay.

384
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:28,420
Strategy s Aye.

385
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:30,720
Okay.

386
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,553
If not,

387
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:36,590
we can use on rotation if you are I from
choosing s when all the people choose s

388
00:23:39,721 --> 00:23:43,260
minus Pi is strictly bigger than you.

389
00:23:43,261 --> 00:23:48,010
I S I prime when other
people choose as my,

390
00:23:48,011 --> 00:23:49,250
the PSI and the key part,

391
00:23:49,251 --> 00:23:54,251
the definition is for all x minus sign.

392
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:57,133
Alright.

393
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,580
All right.
So just say it in words.

394
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:03,820
Pyre I strategy SEI prime is
strictly dominated by her strategy.

395
00:24:04,191 --> 00:24:08,060
Ssi.
If s I always does split me better.

396
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:10,130
Always yields a higher pay off a player.
I,

397
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:15,200
no matter what the other people do
answer this is the same definition we saw

398
00:24:15,201 --> 00:24:19,400
last time. Just being a little bit more
nerdy and putting it in, in some, uh,

399
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:23,100
some notation. Okay. People
panicking about that.

400
00:24:23,101 --> 00:24:27,370
People look like deer in the headlights
yet. No, I'm gonna let you get a correct.

401
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:30,230
Alright.
Alright,

402
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:35,950
let's have a look at another
example. People, okay,

403
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:41,140
I can move this.
All right.

404
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:45,000
So it's not a slightly more
exciting example now. So, uh,

405
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:46,670
imagine the following example.

406
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:51,680
An invader is thinking about invading
a country and there are two ways that

407
00:24:51,781 --> 00:24:53,430
would have two passes if you like,

408
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:58,380
through which he can
lead his army and you,

409
00:24:58,410 --> 00:25:02,970
you are the defender of this country
and you have to decide which of these

410
00:25:02,971 --> 00:25:07,020
passes or which of these routes into
the country you're going to choose to

411
00:25:07,021 --> 00:25:07,854
defend.

412
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:12,940
And the catch is you can only defend
one of these two routes, right?

413
00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:15,570
It's if you want to a real
world example of this,

414
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:19,080
think about the third century BC and
can someone can correct me afterwards.

415
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:23,420
I think if the third century BC, when
Hannibal is thinking of crossing the Alex,

416
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:27,720
right? Not Hannibal, Hannibal
Lecter Hannibal, the general
in the third century BC,

417
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,780
the one with the
elephants. All right. Okay.

418
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:34,590
So the key here is going to
be that there are two passes.

419
00:25:34,650 --> 00:25:39,650
One of these passes is a hard part that
goes over the Alps and the other one is

420
00:25:40,011 --> 00:25:43,430
an easy pass. It goes
along the coast. All right?

421
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:47,280
If the invader chooses the hard pass,

422
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:52,520
he will lose one battalion of his army
simply in getting over the mountains.

423
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:57,840
Something going through the hard past.
Alright, add. If he meets your army,

424
00:25:58,050 --> 00:26:01,470
whichever party chooses,
if he meets your army defending a past,

425
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:05,420
then he'll lose another battalion.
All right, I'll, I haven't given you,

426
00:26:05,421 --> 00:26:07,790
I've given you roughly the choices. The
choices are going to be for the attacker,

427
00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:11,480
which to choose and for the defender,
which pass to defend.

428
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:14,690
But let's put down some payoffs so
we can start talking about this.

429
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:18,880
Why you in this game,
the payoffs for this game,

430
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:24,160
I'm going to be as follows,
such a simple two by two game.

431
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:26,320
This is going to be the attacker.

432
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:31,690
This is Hannibal and this is
going to be deep offender.

433
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,840
And I forgotten which general
was defending and someone's
about to tell me that

434
00:26:34,850 --> 00:26:36,700
dam and there are two palaces.

435
00:26:36,701 --> 00:26:40,970
You could defend the easy
pass or the hard pass on.

436
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:45,060
There's two of you could use to attack
through easy or hard. And again,

437
00:26:45,061 --> 00:26:47,520
easy past here just means no mountains.

438
00:26:47,521 --> 00:26:49,680
We're not talking about something
on the New Jersey turnpike.

439
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:53,370
So the payoffs here,

440
00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:55,330
yeah,

441
00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:57,450
are as follows,
and I'll explain them in a second.

442
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:02,080
All right,
so here's pay off.

443
00:27:02,081 --> 00:27:06,400
The attacker's payoff is how many
battalions that he get to bring into your

444
00:27:06,401 --> 00:27:09,460
country. He only has two
to start with. And for you,

445
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:12,550
it's how many battalions
of his get destroyed.

446
00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:14,980
So just I just give an example.

447
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:19,430
If he goes through the hard pass
and you defend the hard pass,

448
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:23,110
he loses one of those battalions going
over the mountains and the other one

449
00:27:23,111 --> 00:27:23,944
cause you meet you.

450
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:27,920
So he has none left and you find it just
dropped to destroy two of them, right?

451
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,170
Conversely, if he goes on the hard
past and you defend the easy past,

452
00:27:32,530 --> 00:27:35,620
he's going to lose one of those
battalions. Or how have one left?

453
00:27:35,710 --> 00:27:36,940
You lost it in the mountains.

454
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:40,360
But that's the only one who's going to
lose because you were defending the wrong

455
00:27:40,361 --> 00:27:43,540
past. All everyone understand
the payoffs of this game?

456
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:44,980
Yeah.

457
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:48,860
All right. So now imagine
yourself has a Roman general, hi,

458
00:27:48,861 --> 00:27:50,480
this is gonna be a little bit
of a stretch of imagination,

459
00:27:50,481 --> 00:27:51,980
but imagine yourself as a Roman general.

460
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:55,550
And let's figure out what you're
going to do. You're the defender.

461
00:27:55,610 --> 00:27:56,443
What are you going to do?

462
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,033
All right,

463
00:27:58,250 --> 00:28:00,080
so let's have a show of hands.

464
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:04,280
How many of you think you
should defend the easy pass?

465
00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:08,670
Raise your hand. Just raise
your hand. Soap, soap. So Jude
can see the, keep them up.

466
00:28:08,671 --> 00:28:12,690
Weigh them in the air, but emotion
right in the air. What your flags. Okay,

467
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:15,330
because these are the Romans
defending the easy pass.

468
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:18,180
And how many of you think you're
going to defend the hard pass?

469
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:22,860
We have a huge number of people who
don't want to be Roman generals here.

470
00:28:23,450 --> 00:28:26,940
All right, let's try it again.
No abstentions, right? I'm
not going to penalize you.

471
00:28:26,941 --> 00:28:28,440
Get in the wrong item set.
All right,

472
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:30,630
so how many of you think are
going to defend the easy pass?

473
00:28:30,631 --> 00:28:34,920
Raise your hands again and how many
think you're gonna defend the hard pass?

474
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:40,770
Hi, we have a majority choosing. Easy
Pass. I had a lot. A large majority.

475
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:43,440
So what's going on here?
Is it the case?

476
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:48,620
Is it the case that defending the easy
pass dominates defending the hard pass?

477
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:51,531
Is that the case?

478
00:28:51,531 --> 00:28:54,590
Is the case that pending the easy
pass dominates defending the hot pass.

479
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:57,920
You can shout out, no, it's
not in a facts and facts.

480
00:28:58,370 --> 00:29:02,210
We could check that at the attacker
attacks through the easy pass.

481
00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:06,510
Not surprisingly, you do better if you
defend the easy pass on the hard pass,

482
00:29:06,530 --> 00:29:10,640
one versus their sorrow.
But if the attacker was to
attack through the hard pass,

483
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:12,050
again,
not surprisingly,

484
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:16,340
you do better if you defend the hard
pass down the easy pass. All right? It's,

485
00:29:16,341 --> 00:29:19,400
that's not hot. Not, not
an unintuitive a finding.

486
00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:24,050
It isn't the case that he defending
easy dominates defending hard.

487
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:26,840
You just want to match with the attacker.
Nevertheless,

488
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:29,870
almost all of you chose easy.
What's going on?

489
00:29:29,870 --> 00:29:32,390
Can someone tell me what's going on?
Let's get the mics going a second.

490
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:36,390
So can we catch the guy with uh, uh,
yeah. Can we catch this guy with a beard?

491
00:29:36,391 --> 00:29:39,890
If we'll just wait for the
mic to get there. And if you
could stand up, stand up,

492
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:42,880
stand up and up and shout.
There you go.

493
00:29:42,881 --> 00:29:46,100
Because you want to minimize
the amount of, uh, an, uh,

494
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:50,920
of enemy soldiers that reach Rome or
whatever the location is. All right.

495
00:29:50,921 --> 00:29:54,460
You want to minimize the number of
soldiers that reach Rome. That's true.

496
00:29:54,461 --> 00:29:54,971
On the other hand,

497
00:29:54,971 --> 00:29:57,430
we've just argued that you don't
have a dominant strategy here.

498
00:29:57,431 --> 00:30:00,040
It's not the case that
easy dominates hard.

499
00:30:00,041 --> 00:30:01,930
What else could be going
on while we've got you out?

500
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:05,080
What do we get the other guy who's got
his hand up there and the metal and again,

501
00:30:05,081 --> 00:30:08,050
stand up and shout on that Mike
points your Facebook might get.

502
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:12,020
Um, it seems, it seems
as though, uh, while,

503
00:30:12,021 --> 00:30:15,560
while you don't have a,
you don't have a dominating strategy,

504
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:20,420
it seems like Hannibal is, uh,
is better off attacking through.

505
00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:23,090
It seems like he would
attack through the easy pass.

506
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,360
Good. Why does it seem that,
I guess that's, that's right.

507
00:30:25,361 --> 00:30:26,710
We're on the right lines now.
Why does it,

508
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:28,990
why does it seem like he's
going to talk for the easy pass?

509
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:32,080
Well, if you're not defending
the easy path he got, he doesn't,

510
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:35,440
he doesn't lose anyone. And if he
attacks through the the hard pass,

511
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:37,840
he's going to lose at least one battalion.

512
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:41,700
All right? All right, so let's have a
look at it from, let's do the exercise.

513
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:44,460
Let's do the second lesson
by emphasizing the beginning.

514
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:48,240
Let's put ourselves in Hannibal shoes.
That probably boots or something.

515
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:50,660
I had no wait. Whatever you do in your
writing an elephant, whatever you were,

516
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:51,150
all right,

517
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:54,910
let's put ourselves in the Hannibal shoes
and try and figure out what Hannibal's

518
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:59,760
going to do here. All right, so it could
be it from the animal's point of view,

519
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:03,160
he doesn't know which parts
you're going to defend. All right?

520
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:07,700
But let's have a look what happened.
Look at, look at his payoffs. If he, uh,

521
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:08,820
if you were to defend,

522
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:13,880
if you were to defend the easy pass
and he goes through the easy pass,

523
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:16,860
he will get into your
country with one battalion.

524
00:31:17,130 --> 00:31:19,950
And that's the same as he
would have got if he were,

525
00:31:19,951 --> 00:31:21,300
if he went through the hard parts.

526
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:24,600
So if you defend the easy
pass from his point of view,

527
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:27,690
it doesn't matter whether
he chooses the easy pass,

528
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:31,320
he gets one in there or the hard pass,
he gets one in there.

529
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:36,750
But if you were to defend the hard past,
if you were to defend the mountains,

530
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:39,720
then if he chooses the easy pass,

531
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:43,770
he gets both battalions in and
if he chooses the hard pass,

532
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:48,120
he gets new battalions in. All right,
so in this case, easiest better.

533
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,740
And we have to be live at careful.

534
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:54,950
It's not the case that for Hannibal
easy choosing the easy pass to attack

535
00:31:56,071 --> 00:31:59,640
through strictly dominates
choosing the hard pass.

536
00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:03,660
But it is the case that there's
a week notion of domination.

537
00:32:03,661 --> 00:32:06,570
Here it is the case of
new introducing jargon.

538
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:11,660
It is the case that the easy pass for
the attacker weekly dominates the hard

539
00:32:13,351 --> 00:32:16,620
pass for the attacker.
What do we mean by weekly dominates?

540
00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:21,630
It means by choosing the easy
pass he does at least as well.

541
00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:26,500
And sometimes better than he would
have done had he chosen the hard pos.

542
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:30,480
All right, so here we have a second
definition. A new definition for today

543
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:35,640
and again we can use
our jargon definition.

544
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:38,173
Yeah,

545
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:39,440
player.
Oh eyes

546
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:40,970
strategy.

547
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:49,120
Yes.
I prime is weekly

548
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:55,810
dominated by her strategy

549
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:00,750
as I,

550
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:05,370
if I'm going to take
advantage of annotation,

551
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:10,920
if player eyes payoff from choosing s I
against s minus sy is always as big as

552
00:33:15,310 --> 00:33:20,310
all equal to her pay off from choosing
s I prime against s minus I and this has

553
00:33:23,621 --> 00:33:28,390
to be true for all things,
but anyone else could do.

554
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:30,970
And in addition

555
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:37,800
player eyes payoff from choosing s I
against as minus side is strictly better

556
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:44,760
than a payoff from choosing sia prime
against s minus PSI for at least one

557
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:50,560
thing. Whatever else could
do. Fine. So just check.

558
00:33:50,561 --> 00:33:55,561
That's exactly corresponds to the easy
and hard thing we just had before.

559
00:33:55,690 --> 00:33:56,523
I'll say it again,

560
00:33:56,620 --> 00:34:01,620
play I strategy sie prime is
weekly dominated by our strategy.

561
00:34:02,771 --> 00:34:03,604
SSI,

562
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:08,700
if she always does at least as well
by choosing Sei than choosing us.

563
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:12,820
I prime regardless of what anyone else
does and sometimes she does strictly

564
00:34:12,821 --> 00:34:14,830
better.
All right.

565
00:34:14,950 --> 00:34:18,130
And it seems a pretty powerful
lesson that just as we said,

566
00:34:18,131 --> 00:34:20,560
you should never choose a
strictly domination strategy.

567
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:24,310
You're probably never going to choose
a weekly dominated strategy either,

568
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:28,570
but it's a little more subtle.
All right. Now that definition,

569
00:34:28,571 --> 00:34:30,670
if you're worried about what I've written
down here and you want to see it in

570
00:34:30,671 --> 00:34:35,020
words on the handout I've already put
on the web that has the summary of the

571
00:34:35,021 --> 00:34:35,860
first pass,

572
00:34:36,010 --> 00:34:40,870
I included this definition in words as
well to compare the definition and words

573
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:44,440
with what's written here in the
nerdy notation on the board.

574
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:49,330
Right now, since we think
that Hannibal, the attacker,

575
00:34:49,390 --> 00:34:52,360
is not going to play a
weekly dominated strategy,

576
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:55,810
we think that Hannibal is not
going to choose the hard pass.

577
00:34:55,900 --> 00:35:00,670
He's going to attack on the easy pass.
And given that which should we defend,

578
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:05,110
we should defend it easy, which is
what most of you shows. So be honest.

579
00:35:05,111 --> 00:35:08,870
Now was that way. Most of you chose
easy. Yeah, probably was right.

580
00:35:08,871 --> 00:35:10,270
You might be able to read this.
All right.

581
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:12,520
So by putting ourselves in Hannibal shoes,

582
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:17,440
we could figure out that his heart
attack strategy was done that was weekly

583
00:35:17,441 --> 00:35:22,210
dominated. He's going to choose easy, so
we should defend easy. Having said that,

584
00:35:22,211 --> 00:35:23,650
of course Hannibal went
through the mountains,

585
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:27,220
which kind of screws up the lesson but
too late now.

586
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:29,080
All right,

587
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:34,420
now that I promised you we'd
get back to the, the uh,

588
00:35:34,450 --> 00:35:35,560
the game from last time.

589
00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:37,930
Yeah.

590
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:42,230
All right, so what do we want where we
got to so far on this past, we know,

591
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:47,500
we know from last time that you should
not choose a dominated strategy and we

592
00:35:47,781 --> 00:35:50,560
also know with probably
aren't going to choose a week.

593
00:35:50,561 --> 00:35:51,530
You don't need to strategy.

594
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:55,640
And we also know that you put yourself
in other people's shoes and figure out

595
00:35:55,641 --> 00:35:57,230
that they're not going
to pay off strongly,

596
00:35:57,410 --> 00:35:59,240
strictly or weekly dominated strategy.

597
00:35:59,241 --> 00:36:02,480
That seems a pretty good way to predict
how other people are going to play.

598
00:36:02,810 --> 00:36:06,530
So let's take those ideas and go back
to the numbers game from last time.

599
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:09,290
Now before I do that, I don't need
the people at home to see this.

600
00:36:09,291 --> 00:36:13,940
But how many of you were here last time?
[inaudible] I asked the wrong question.

601
00:36:13,941 --> 00:36:16,350
How are you were not here
last time? All right, so, uh,

602
00:36:16,490 --> 00:36:20,720
we handed out again that game we ended
out again the game with the numbers,

603
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:24,180
but just in case, let me just read out
the gate. The uh, the game, you play it,

604
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:29,930
this was the game you play without
showing your neighbor what you're doing.

605
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:33,740
Put it in the box below a whole
number between one and 100.

606
00:36:34,130 --> 00:36:38,780
We will in fact have calculated the
average number chosen in the class.

607
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:43,010
And the winner of this game is the person
who gets closest to two thirds times

608
00:36:43,011 --> 00:36:47,500
that average number, they will win
$5 minus the difference in pennies.

609
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:52,940
All right, so everybody filled that in
last time. And I have that choice is here.

610
00:36:53,810 --> 00:36:57,770
So let's just before we reveal who won,
let's discuss this a little bit.

611
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:00,080
That'd be come down.
Houses have to be off the stage.

612
00:37:01,370 --> 00:37:04,760
I'd figured out it's got the mix up about
a second. Let me get some mics ready.

613
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:07,220
All right. So, um,

614
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:10,670
let me find out some people here
and see what people did a second.

615
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:15,410
Or you can be honest here since I've got
everything in front of, in front of me.

616
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:18,710
So how many of you chose some number?

617
00:37:18,711 --> 00:37:21,590
Like a 32 33 34?

618
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,900
Actually, I tell you,
wait, nine of you did.

619
00:37:25,901 --> 00:37:30,300
So should I read out the
name if I embarrass people?
All right, so, so, uh, our,

620
00:37:30,330 --> 00:37:34,350
we've got Lynette's uh, liquor. Hussan
we've got Christian bargin. Is that,

621
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,980
there's nine of you here is try to get,
how many of you,

622
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:39,910
how many of you chose numbers
between 32 and 34? Yeah. Okay.

623
00:37:39,911 --> 00:37:42,610
So if you're not a number, you don't know
these things. Some hands up. All right?

624
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:43,810
Just keep it,
keep your hands up a second.

625
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:45,760
Even hot headed up there and those people.
All right,

626
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:49,010
so let me ask people why we're
here. Can we, can we can, we can,

627
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:52,240
can you get their hand into
the guy? What's your name?
If we get him to stand up,

628
00:37:52,450 --> 00:37:56,920
stand up a second and shadows the cost
me. Hey, what's your name? Chris. Chris,

629
00:37:56,921 --> 00:38:00,160
you're on this list somewhere. I'm you're
not in this lifetime. I know. Mine.

630
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:04,300
What did you choose? I think I chose 30
okay. 30 is, that's pretty close. Okay.

631
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:07,690
So why did you choose 30 cause I thought
everyone was going to be around like

632
00:38:07,691 --> 00:38:12,691
the 45 range cause 66 is two thirds or
right around of a hundred and then we're

633
00:38:13,331 --> 00:38:16,210
going to go two thirds less than that.
And I did one less than that one.

634
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:19,510
All right. Okay. All right, so
let's look at that. Thank you.

635
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:22,060
Let's get one of the others are,
there was another one in here.

636
00:38:22,061 --> 00:38:23,020
Can you just raise your hands again?

637
00:38:23,021 --> 00:38:26,590
The people who are silver rounds
33 34 the somebody in here.

638
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:31,410
Can we get you to stand up and who
you are between Mike said. Yup,

639
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:36,850
go ahead, shout it out. What's
your name? Festival. Ryan.

640
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:40,120
Ryan, I must have you here as well.
And if mind, what did you choose?

641
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:45,110
33 or 33 are you, did you are
Ryan low? You are around. Okay,

642
00:38:45,111 --> 00:38:47,500
this is good.
Go ahead.

643
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:52,800
I thought similar to a Chris actually and
also thought that if we got two thirds

644
00:38:54,101 --> 00:38:59,101
and everyone was choosing numbers in
between 100 and up 33 would be around the

645
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:00,650
number.

646
00:39:00,650 --> 00:39:04,220
All right, so just just to repeat the
argument that we just heard, again,

647
00:39:04,221 --> 00:39:05,120
you have to shout out more than,

648
00:39:05,130 --> 00:39:06,370
I'm guessing people didn't
hear that in the room.

649
00:39:06,371 --> 00:39:08,450
So let me repeating to make
sure everyone hears that.

650
00:39:08,990 --> 00:39:12,500
And reason for choosing a number like
33 might get, might go as follows.

651
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:13,760
If the people,

652
00:39:13,761 --> 00:39:18,620
if people in the room choose randomly
between 100 then the average is going to

653
00:39:18,621 --> 00:39:23,621
be around 50 say and two thirds of
50 is around 33 33 in the third free.

654
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:30,800
All right, so that's a pretty
good piece of reasoning. Alright,

655
00:39:30,890 --> 00:39:33,920
what's wrong with that reasoning?
What's wrong with that?

656
00:39:34,130 --> 00:39:35,050
What's wrong that can we,
uh,

657
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:38,960
can we get the guy or the woman in the
striped shirt here? Yeah. Yes. I'm sorry.

658
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:42,230
We have not a woman for
a while so can keep,

659
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:45,590
even if everyone else had
the same reasoning as you,

660
00:39:45,591 --> 00:39:49,790
it's still going to be way too high.
All right, so, so in in particular,

661
00:39:49,791 --> 00:39:52,040
if everyone else had the same reason
as you, it's going to be way too high.

662
00:39:52,041 --> 00:39:54,320
All right?
So if everyone else reasons that way,

663
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:59,500
then everyone in the room would choose
a number like 33 or 34 and in that case,

664
00:40:00,291 --> 00:40:02,340
the average would be what? Sorry. Uh,

665
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:04,940
so the average we have just to show
that two thirds of the average would be,

666
00:40:04,950 --> 00:40:07,730
would be what? Something
like 22. All right.

667
00:40:07,970 --> 00:40:12,920
So the flaw in the argument that
crest and Ryan had a little bit,

668
00:40:12,921 --> 00:40:17,600
it isn't a bad argument, it's
a good starting point. But
the floor in the mistake,

669
00:40:17,690 --> 00:40:21,010
in the argument, it was the
first sentence in the arguments.

670
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:25,820
The first sentence in the argument
was if the people in the room shoes or

671
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:30,680
random, then they will
choose around 50 that's true.

672
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:35,450
The problem is the people
in the room arm's going to
choose at random. All right?

673
00:40:35,510 --> 00:40:36,590
Look around the room a second.

674
00:40:36,591 --> 00:40:39,980
Look around yourself to any of you
look like a random number generator.

675
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:42,680
Actually from here I
can see something to do.

676
00:40:42,681 --> 00:40:45,950
I'm not gonna I'm not gonna put
all right. All right. All right,

677
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:47,660
so I'm actually looking
at some of your answers.

678
00:40:47,661 --> 00:40:52,661
Maybe some of you are right on the whole
Yale students are not random number

679
00:40:53,661 --> 00:40:56,420
generators. They're trying
to win the game. All right,

680
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:01,190
so the unlikely to choose numbers
at random, right? If they,

681
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:06,300
we also further arguments if in fact
everyone thought that way and if you

682
00:41:06,301 --> 00:41:08,930
figured out everyone was going to figure
out, cause I'm gonna think that way,

683
00:41:09,170 --> 00:41:14,170
then you would expect everyone to choose
a number like 33 and in that case you

684
00:41:14,271 --> 00:41:17,840
should choose a number like 22 how
many of you raise your hand a second.

685
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:20,690
How many of you chose numbers
in the range? 21 to 23

686
00:41:22,370 --> 00:41:25,960
there's way more than you than that.
I'll start reading you out as well.

687
00:41:26,030 --> 00:41:29,810
The actually about 12 of you raise your
hands is 12 she'll be 12 hands going up

688
00:41:29,811 --> 00:41:32,870
somewhere. There's two, three hands
going up. Four, five hours ago,

689
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:36,590
there's actually 12 people who chew,
who chose exactly.

690
00:41:36,591 --> 00:41:40,850
22 so can sort of be more if
we include 23 and 21 all right,

691
00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:44,990
so those people, I'm, I'm guessing,
I'm guessing we're thinking this way.

692
00:41:44,991 --> 00:41:47,930
Is that right?
Let me get one of my 22 is up again.

693
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:49,970
Me.

694
00:41:49,970 --> 00:41:53,800
All right, so here's a 22 is
when, but we want to get this guy.

695
00:41:53,801 --> 00:41:57,280
So what's your name sir?
Stand up.

696
00:41:57,281 --> 00:42:00,160
Stand up and shout Brian.
Yup.

697
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:05,280
And you chose 22 I chose 22 because I
thought that most people would play the

698
00:42:07,181 --> 00:42:12,181
game dividing by two thirds a couple of
times and give numbers averaging around

699
00:42:14,111 --> 00:42:16,420
the low thirties all right.
All right.

700
00:42:16,421 --> 00:42:19,570
So do you think people are going to
play a plucking away in particular?

701
00:42:19,571 --> 00:42:24,220
If you think people are gonna choose the
strategy of Ryan and Chris and choose

702
00:42:24,221 --> 00:42:27,340
around 33 then 22 seems a great answer,

703
00:42:27,850 --> 00:42:29,800
but you underestimate
your Yale colleagues.

704
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:34,570
You undress me all y'all can wax and
fax at 22 was was was way too high.

705
00:42:34,890 --> 00:42:39,490
That's way too long. All right, now again,
let's just, it's right. The point here is,

706
00:42:39,491 --> 00:42:43,900
it's a repeat the point here. The point
here is when you're playing a game,

707
00:42:44,110 --> 00:42:47,110
you want to think about what other people
are trying to do to try and predict

708
00:42:47,111 --> 00:42:47,950
what they're trying to do.

709
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:53,560
And it's not necessarily a great starting
point to assume that the people around

710
00:42:53,561 --> 00:42:55,420
you are random number generators.

711
00:42:55,510 --> 00:42:59,290
They have aims trying to win
and they have strategies to,

712
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:04,450
let me take this back to the
board a second. So in particular,

713
00:43:04,510 --> 00:43:08,620
are there any strategies
here we can really rule out?

714
00:43:08,710 --> 00:43:10,960
I said we're not millionaires.
We said already people are not random.

715
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:14,380
Are there any choices
we can just rule out?

716
00:43:14,381 --> 00:43:18,430
We know people are not going
to choose those traces. Uh,

717
00:43:18,750 --> 00:43:20,350
let's have someone here.
We have the guy in, in,

718
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:24,970
in green on his weight weight fairly that,
yup. Great. Stand up. Give me your name.

719
00:43:25,350 --> 00:43:28,200
Uh, my name is nick and shout it
out to we. We're going here. Uh,

720
00:43:28,390 --> 00:43:32,200
no one is going to choose number over
50 notes, which is number 50. Okay.

721
00:43:32,201 --> 00:43:35,230
I was doing that. That's a, that that
actually got it. Okay. That's fair enough.

722
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:39,250
Some people did.
That's fair enough.

723
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:42,880
I wasn't going to get a little bit then.
That's fine.

724
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,040
I just don't think only a
little bit less ambitious.

725
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:50,110
Somebody said 66 somebody said 66
so let's, let's stop analyzing this.

726
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:01,680
All right,
so in particular,

727
00:44:02,050 --> 00:44:06,830
this is something about these
strategy choices that are great, sir,

728
00:44:08,610 --> 00:44:12,780
that are greater from 67 at any rate.
All right.

729
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:15,960
Certainly, I mean a 66 I said,
let's go up a little bit.

730
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:18,570
So these numbers bigger than 67

731
00:44:20,070 --> 00:44:24,560
what's wrong with numbers?
Bigger than 67 what's wrong?

732
00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:27,030
Raise your hands. Governance. That what's,
what's wrong? You're gonna get the,

733
00:44:27,050 --> 00:44:30,630
the guy in red is right close to the mic.
Stand up. Give me your name. Stand up,

734
00:44:30,631 --> 00:44:32,990
shout it to the crowd and Peter.
Yep.

735
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:37,680
And if everyone chooses a hundred
it would be 67 all right, good.

736
00:44:37,681 --> 00:44:41,880
So even if everyone in the
number, everyone in the room,
didn't she just randomly,

737
00:44:41,881 --> 00:44:45,360
but they all chose a hundred
a very unlikely circumstance.

738
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:49,440
But even if they ever want
to chose hundred the highest
the average could. Sorry,

739
00:44:49,470 --> 00:44:54,390
the highest two thirds of the average
could possibly be is 66 and two thirds,

740
00:44:54,391 --> 00:44:56,730
hence 67 would be a pretty
good choice in that case.

741
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:59,970
So numbers bigger than 67
seem pretty crazy choices,

742
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:02,910
but crazy isn't the world isn't
the word I'm looking for here.

743
00:45:03,030 --> 00:45:06,420
What can we say about those choices,
those strategies?

744
00:45:06,450 --> 00:45:10,770
6,706 a bigger than 67 68 and above.
What can we say about those?

745
00:45:10,771 --> 00:45:14,580
Choices are to the authority right behind
him. Right behind you. Shout it out.

746
00:45:15,490 --> 00:45:19,310
No pay offs. They have no payoffs.
What? What's the jargon here? It's,

747
00:45:19,370 --> 00:45:22,410
let's use our jargon. Somebody shout
it out. What's the jargon about that?

748
00:45:23,010 --> 00:45:27,240
They're dominated. All right, so these
strategies are dominated. Actually,

749
00:45:27,241 --> 00:45:30,600
there are only weakly dominated, but
that's okay. They're certainly dominated,

750
00:45:31,150 --> 00:45:33,330
right?
In particular as strategy,

751
00:45:33,331 --> 00:45:38,331
like AC is dominated by choosing 67 right?

752
00:45:38,790 --> 00:45:43,790
You will always get a higher up a payoff
from choosing 67 at least as high and

753
00:45:44,551 --> 00:45:49,290
sometimes higher than the payoff you
would have got had you chosen 80 no matter

754
00:45:49,291 --> 00:45:53,490
what else happened in the room.
So these strategies are dominated.

755
00:45:53,730 --> 00:45:58,730
We know from the very first lesson of
the class last time that no one should

756
00:45:58,801 --> 00:46:02,160
choose these strategies that
dominated strategies. All right,

757
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:07,460
so did anyone choose
strategies bigger than 67 okay,

758
00:46:07,561 --> 00:46:12,420
I'm not going to read out names
here, but turns out four of you did.

759
00:46:12,421 --> 00:46:15,750
And I'm not going to make your way
here. Okay. All right. So okay,

760
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:20,580
for the four of you did, nevermind,
nevermind. But well, yeah, mind actually.

761
00:46:20,581 --> 00:46:24,030
Yeah. All right. All right.

762
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:26,220
So once we've eliminated,

763
00:46:26,610 --> 00:46:31,610
once we've eliminated the possibility
that anyone in the room is going to choose

764
00:46:32,191 --> 00:46:37,191
a strategy bigger than 67 it's as
if these numbers 68 through 100 are

765
00:46:39,571 --> 00:46:41,520
irrelevant.
It's really is.

766
00:46:41,521 --> 00:46:46,521
If the game is being played where the
only choices available on the table are

767
00:46:46,531 --> 00:46:50,220
one through 67 is that right?
Is that right?

768
00:46:50,430 --> 00:46:53,340
We know no one's gonna choose 68 and
above. So we can just forget them.

769
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:57,540
We can delete those strategies.
And once we delete those strategies,

770
00:46:57,600 --> 00:47:02,580
all that's left are choices
one through 67 all right,

771
00:47:02,970 --> 00:47:06,630
so can somebody help me out? Now what?
Can I come out? What can I conclude? No,

772
00:47:06,631 --> 00:47:10,820
I've concluded that the strategy is 68
through 100 essentially don't exist or

773
00:47:10,821 --> 00:47:14,850
have been releases. What can I conclude?
Uh, let me see if I got a mic in here.

774
00:47:14,851 --> 00:47:19,440
That's a stamp. Stand up. Wait for
the mic and he comes to the right.

775
00:47:19,441 --> 00:47:23,940
Good shout out. Then all strategies
45 and above are this also ruled out.

776
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:27,630
Good. Good. So your name
is Henry. Henry is saying,

777
00:47:27,810 --> 00:47:32,810
once we've figured out that no one should
choose a strategy bigger than 67 then

778
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:38,050
we can go another step and say if
those strategies never existed,

779
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:42,100
then the same argument rules
out or similar arguments,

780
00:47:42,340 --> 00:47:47,340
rules out strategies bigger
than 45 let's be careful here.

781
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:53,340
The strategies that
are less than 67 bought

782
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:59,200
but bigger than 45 is that
your strategies are not.

783
00:47:59,690 --> 00:48:03,640
They are not dominated strategies.
In the original game in particular,

784
00:48:03,641 --> 00:48:07,540
we just argued that if everyone in
the room shows a 100 then 67 will be a

785
00:48:07,541 --> 00:48:08,374
winning strategy.

786
00:48:08,770 --> 00:48:13,770
So it's not the case that the strategy
is between 45 and 67 our domination

787
00:48:14,351 --> 00:48:18,880
strategies,
but it is the case that they're dominated.

788
00:48:18,970 --> 00:48:23,620
Once we delete the dominator strategies,
once we delete 67 and above.

789
00:48:24,370 --> 00:48:28,480
All right, so these strategies to
be careful here, the word weekly,

790
00:48:28,481 --> 00:48:31,720
yet these strategies are not

791
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:34,180
weekly dominated

792
00:48:38,210 --> 00:48:39,960
in the original game.

793
00:48:44,190 --> 00:48:45,840
Bye Bye.
Oh dominated

794
00:48:48,070 --> 00:48:49,100
weekly dominated

795
00:48:52,730 --> 00:48:56,030
once we delete

796
00:48:58,910 --> 00:49:01,400
68 through 100

797
00:49:02,790 --> 00:49:07,350
to all of the strategies,
45 through 67 are gone now.

798
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:13,410
So okay, let's have a, let's have a look.
Did anyone choose? Raise your hands.

799
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:15,030
Be Brave here.
Did anyone,

800
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:20,300
did anyone choose a
strategy between 45 and 67

801
00:49:22,570 --> 00:49:26,460
1446 and 67 no one's right now,
but I know some of you take,

802
00:49:26,461 --> 00:49:28,740
cause I've got it in front of me,
right? So these four of you did,

803
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:32,010
and I won't read out those names yet, but
I might read them out next time. Okay,

804
00:49:32,011 --> 00:49:36,510
so the four, four more people
shows those strategies. All right?

805
00:49:36,810 --> 00:49:40,800
Now notice there's a different
part of this, this argument,

806
00:49:40,801 --> 00:49:44,400
the argument that eliminates
strategies 67 and above,

807
00:49:44,401 --> 00:49:47,370
or second 68 upwards fat strategy.

808
00:49:47,371 --> 00:49:51,240
Just involve the first lesson of last
time. Do not choose a dominator strategy.

809
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:55,620
Admittedly weak here, but still.
All right? But the second, uh,

810
00:49:55,860 --> 00:50:00,750
the second slice strategies,
45 through 67,

811
00:50:00,990 --> 00:50:03,780
getting rid of those strategies
involves a little bit more.

812
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:08,960
You've got to put yourself in the shoes
of your fellow classmen and figure out

813
00:50:10,590 --> 00:50:14,580
they're not going to choose 67 and
above essentially the first argument.

814
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:17,490
That's a straightforward argument.
The second argument says,

815
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:19,380
I put myself in other people's shoes.

816
00:50:19,470 --> 00:50:22,320
I realize they're not going
to play a dominated strategy.

817
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:25,380
And therefore having realized they're
not going to pay a dominant strategy,

818
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:29,180
I shouldn't play a strategy
or between 45 and 67.

819
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:32,600
So this argument is an in shoes argument.

820
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:34,153
Okay,

821
00:50:36,570 --> 00:50:41,130
now what? Where can we go now? Yeah.
So let's have the guy in the beard,

822
00:50:41,131 --> 00:50:46,010
but let me the might get him, uh, all
right, and yell out your name. Uh,

823
00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:46,770
Carter,

824
00:50:46,770 --> 00:50:49,890
you just repeat the same reasoning again
and again and eventually get down to

825
00:50:49,891 --> 00:50:51,780
one. All right, well let's,
let's, let's, we'll do that,

826
00:50:51,781 --> 00:50:53,340
but let's go one step at a time.

827
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:57,070
So now we've ruled out the possibility
that anyone's going to choose a strategy

828
00:50:57,090 --> 00:50:58,950
68 from the bottom because they,
we could dominate is,

829
00:50:59,070 --> 00:51:01,280
and we've ruled out the possibility
that anyone's gonna choose the traffic

830
00:51:01,290 --> 00:51:04,470
between 46 and 67
because those strategies,

831
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:06,600
because those strategies are dominated
once we've rolled out the dominant

832
00:51:06,630 --> 00:51:10,350
strategies. So we know no one's choosing
any strategies. About 45 it does.

833
00:51:10,351 --> 00:51:12,600
If the number is 46 and above don't exist.

834
00:51:12,810 --> 00:51:17,070
So we know that the highest and anyone
could ever choose is 45 and two thirds of

835
00:51:17,071 --> 00:51:21,960
45 is roughly someone
help me out. They're 30,

836
00:51:21,961 --> 00:51:24,870
right? Roughly 30. All right. So we know

837
00:51:26,370 --> 00:51:31,370
that all the numbers between 45 and 30,

838
00:51:33,690 --> 00:51:38,640
these strategies were not dominated
and they weren't dominated even after

839
00:51:38,670 --> 00:51:43,260
leading the dominator strategies.
But they are dominated once we deleted,

840
00:51:43,261 --> 00:51:45,950
not just the nominated but, but also the
strategies that were dominantly wants.

841
00:51:45,970 --> 00:51:49,720
We deleted the dominated strategist. All
right, I'm not gonna try and write that,

842
00:51:49,721 --> 00:51:52,080
but if you try and write it in your notes.
All right,

843
00:51:52,350 --> 00:51:55,050
so without writing that
argument down in detail,

844
00:51:55,110 --> 00:52:00,110
notice that we can rule out the strategies
30 through 45 not by just examining

845
00:52:00,181 --> 00:52:01,200
our own payoffs,

846
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:05,070
not just by putting ourselves in other
people's shoes and realizing they're not

847
00:52:05,071 --> 00:52:06,390
going to choose a dominant strategy,

848
00:52:06,780 --> 00:52:11,760
but by putting ourself in other people's
shoes while they are putting themselves

849
00:52:11,850 --> 00:52:15,480
in someone else's shoes and figuring
out what they're going to do. All right,

850
00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:19,740
so this isn't in shoes per capita
where we are here. This isn't

851
00:52:20,130 --> 00:52:23,370
Jane shoes in shoes,
arguments.

852
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:29,230
At which point you might want
to invent the sock. All right?

853
00:52:30,130 --> 00:52:32,380
Now where's this going? Because we
were able to tell where it's going.

854
00:52:32,530 --> 00:52:36,880
We were able to rule out 68 and above.
Then we're able to route 46 and above.

855
00:52:36,940 --> 00:52:41,050
Now we're able to rule out 31 and above.
All right?

856
00:52:41,110 --> 00:52:43,990
By the next slice down,
we'll be able to eliminate a,

857
00:52:44,020 --> 00:52:47,170
what is it about 20 and above.
All right,

858
00:52:47,171 --> 00:52:52,171
so 30 down to above 20 and
this will be an [inaudible]

859
00:52:53,390 --> 00:52:56,600
in shoes,
in shoes,

860
00:52:57,770 --> 00:53:00,230
in shoes,
right?

861
00:53:00,870 --> 00:53:03,210
These strategies aren't dominated,
nor are,

862
00:53:03,211 --> 00:53:06,270
they don't want you to beat the dominant
his strategies nor we donated the

863
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:08,400
trashes dominated once we
clean them on his tragedies,

864
00:53:08,401 --> 00:53:09,290
but they are dominated a bunch.

865
00:53:09,291 --> 00:53:11,980
We delete the structures of the dominate
in the neck. You get what I'm doing?

866
00:53:12,270 --> 00:53:16,180
Okay. All right. So where does
this argument going to go? Well,

867
00:53:16,470 --> 00:53:20,790
where's his argument going to go?
It's gonna go all the way down to one.

868
00:53:21,210 --> 00:53:23,460
We all the way down to one.
We could repeat this argument.

869
00:53:23,461 --> 00:53:27,360
We're down to one notice, but once
we've deleted the dominator strategies,

870
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:28,650
we know I,

871
00:53:28,651 --> 00:53:32,910
I'd said before about four people chose
the strategy and in here about four

872
00:53:32,911 --> 00:53:35,520
people chose their strategy,
but in this range,

873
00:53:35,521 --> 00:53:40,140
30 through 45 I had lots of people.
Lots.

874
00:53:40,170 --> 00:53:43,870
How many of you chose a number
between 30 and 45 all right.

875
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,690
The more than that and your guarantee
you more than that. Matches number two,

876
00:53:46,700 --> 00:53:48,870
put that in 45 all right.
In fact,

877
00:53:48,990 --> 00:53:51,810
the people who chose where we started
off that e three chosen that right?

878
00:53:52,130 --> 00:53:56,190
I had a lot more of you chose numbers
between 20 and 30 so we're really getting

879
00:53:56,191 --> 00:53:58,620
into the, the, the, the
meter, the distribution here.

880
00:53:58,770 --> 00:54:02,850
We're seeing that these are choices that
perhaps are ruled out by this kind of

881
00:54:02,851 --> 00:54:05,190
reasoning.
All right?

882
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:09,960
Now I'm still not going to quite reveal
yet who won? I want to take this one.

883
00:54:09,980 --> 00:54:12,330
Just one step more abstracts.
All right,

884
00:54:12,331 --> 00:54:13,890
so I want to just discuss
this a little bit more.

885
00:54:14,430 --> 00:54:19,430
I want to discuss the
consequence of rationality in
playing games slightly first

886
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:22,440
offical for a few minutes.
All right,

887
00:54:22,830 --> 00:54:25,890
so I claim that if you
are irrational player,

888
00:54:25,891 --> 00:54:29,430
by which I mean somebody who's trying to
maximize that pay offs by that play of

889
00:54:29,431 --> 00:54:32,190
the game,
that is simply being rational.

890
00:54:37,660 --> 00:54:42,660
Just being a rational player moves out
playing these dominated strategies.

891
00:54:43,260 --> 00:54:47,500
All right. So the four of you who chose
numbers bigger than 67, his name is,

892
00:54:47,501 --> 00:54:50,920
I'm not going to read out.
Maybe they were making a mistake.

893
00:54:52,190 --> 00:54:54,280
Alright.
However,

894
00:54:54,910 --> 00:54:59,910
however the next slice down
requires more than just rationality.

895
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:06,240
What else does it require?
Ah, yes. Okay. Can I,

896
00:55:06,310 --> 00:55:09,090
can I get this guy again? Sorry. Shout
out your name again. I forgot net.

897
00:55:09,550 --> 00:55:12,400
Nick shackle that nick. Yep. Uh,

898
00:55:12,401 --> 00:55:15,850
the assumption that your opponents are
being rational as well. Good. Good.

899
00:55:15,870 --> 00:55:19,750
So to rule out the second slice,
I need to be rational.

900
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:20,980
Yeah.

901
00:55:20,980 --> 00:55:24,610
Myself and I need to know.

902
00:55:26,620 --> 00:55:27,453
Okay.

903
00:55:27,590 --> 00:55:29,780
But others are rational.

904
00:55:31,220 --> 00:55:31,810
Yeah.

905
00:55:31,810 --> 00:55:33,150
Alright. That's a legible. But then my,

906
00:55:33,151 --> 00:55:37,700
what it says is rational and knowledge
that other people are rational.

907
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:42,350
Now how about the next slice off to
that? Well, now I need to be rational.

908
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:48,160
I need to know that other people are
rational and I need to know that other

909
00:55:49,671 --> 00:55:53,570
people know that all the people are
rational. All right, so to get this slice,

910
00:55:53,610 --> 00:55:57,950
let's get this next slide here.
I need rationality as some of you know,

911
00:55:57,951 --> 00:56:00,350
that's widely criticized and
the social sciences these days,

912
00:56:00,380 --> 00:56:03,280
I'll be right to assume that people
are rational. But to get this slice,

913
00:56:03,290 --> 00:56:04,340
I need rationality.

914
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:08,920
I need knowledge of rationality
that's called that k are,

915
00:56:10,090 --> 00:56:14,120
am. I need knowledge of
knowledge of rationality.

916
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:18,710
All right? How's I go down to further?
I'm going to need rationality.

917
00:56:19,130 --> 00:56:20,570
I need to know people that are optional.

918
00:56:20,780 --> 00:56:23,650
I need to know that people
know that people are rational.

919
00:56:23,770 --> 00:56:26,730
And I need to know the people
know that people know that people.

920
00:56:27,850 --> 00:56:28,683
All right?

921
00:56:28,980 --> 00:56:32,490
And let's just make this more
concrete for you. These people,

922
00:56:33,450 --> 00:56:36,900
these people,
the four people who chose this,

923
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:38,610
they made a mistake.

924
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:44,510
What about the four people who
chose numbers between 45 and 67?

925
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:46,610
What can we conclude about those people?

926
00:56:47,030 --> 00:56:51,380
The number of the people who chose between
45 and 67 so I read out their names.

927
00:56:51,940 --> 00:56:55,490
No, I want, perhaps I've had to know
what can we can talk about the people.

928
00:56:56,670 --> 00:56:58,060
Yeah. Uh, we're never gonna make it.

929
00:56:58,110 --> 00:57:00,840
Let's try and get them making their
come forward as far as you can.

930
00:57:00,841 --> 00:57:05,570
And then it really shattered. Their
classmates are pretty dumb, right? Right.

931
00:57:05,610 --> 00:57:10,610
It's not necessarily that the four
people who chose between 46 and 67 are

932
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:14,970
themselves thick. Instead, they
think the rest of you are thick.

933
00:57:15,830 --> 00:57:18,240
All right?
And down here,

934
00:57:18,420 --> 00:57:21,780
this doesn't require people to be thick
or to think the rest of you or think

935
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:23,910
they are just people who
think that you think, sorry,

936
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:27,600
that just people who think that you think
that that ethic. Alright, and so on,

937
00:57:27,990 --> 00:57:30,970
and again, all the way to one,
we're going to needs very,

938
00:57:30,971 --> 00:57:34,560
very many rounds of knowledge, of
knowledge, of knowledge, of rationality.

939
00:57:34,830 --> 00:57:38,850
Does anyone know what we call it?
If we assume an infinite sequence of,

940
00:57:38,851 --> 00:57:43,250
I know that you know that. I know that
you know that. I know that you know that.

941
00:57:43,251 --> 00:57:44,220
I know that you know something.

942
00:57:44,990 --> 00:57:49,160
What's the expression for that? 10
believe it or not. Technical expression.

943
00:57:50,460 --> 00:57:53,520
Tandem, especially with that in
philosophy is common knowledge.

944
00:57:54,420 --> 00:57:59,230
Common Knowledge.
Chicken never spell.

945
00:57:59,231 --> 00:58:03,100
So I'm gonna, I'm gonna win. All right.
Common Knowledge. Common knowledge is,

946
00:58:03,190 --> 00:58:06,940
I know something. You know it. You
know that I know it. I know that unit.

947
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,040
I know that, you know, the, I know
it, et Cetera, et Cetera, et cetera.

948
00:58:09,070 --> 00:58:10,030
Infinite sequence.

949
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:11,653
All right.

950
00:58:12,830 --> 00:58:16,440
All right. But if we had common
knowledge of rationality in this class,

951
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:21,420
then the optimal choice
would have been one.

952
00:58:23,220 --> 00:58:27,720
How many of you chose one? Look around
on the roads. There's paneling over,

953
00:58:27,730 --> 00:58:29,730
like keep your hands up a second.
How many of you chose one?

954
00:58:32,010 --> 00:58:35,760
So actually a lot of you chose one. One
was the modal answer. In this class,

955
00:58:35,761 --> 00:58:39,960
a lot of good shows weren't. All
right. So those people did pretty well.

956
00:58:40,010 --> 00:58:42,960
They must've done, you know, they
must be thinking they're about to win,

957
00:58:45,010 --> 00:58:45,910
but they didn't win.

958
00:58:47,630 --> 00:58:50,750
So it turns out that the
average in this class,

959
00:58:50,780 --> 00:58:54,410
the average choice was
about 13 and a third,

960
00:58:54,830 --> 00:58:57,680
which means two thirds
of the average was nine.

961
00:58:58,460 --> 00:59:01,980
Two thirds of the average was nine.
And some of you chose nine.

962
00:59:01,981 --> 00:59:05,840
So if you are here, stand up, uh,
the following people choose nine.

963
00:59:06,140 --> 00:59:08,880
Um, that's not right. Whether
the people who shows nine,

964
00:59:08,890 --> 00:59:11,990
I've got one here somewhere.
Sorry. There's so many pages
that people, here we go,

965
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:15,810
the following people shows nines who
stand up if you're here. Uh, and uh,

966
00:59:15,870 --> 00:59:18,170
if you're that person's roommate
or they're not here. All right?

967
00:59:18,171 --> 00:59:21,470
So leashing Chang, at least in
Shanghai here. Stand up. You're here.

968
00:59:21,830 --> 00:59:23,240
And Christopher [inaudible],

969
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:28,340
Christopher Bharara who can stand up if
you're here and, uh, William official,

970
00:59:28,370 --> 00:59:33,230
are you here? I don't know if he's here
at Jed. Click or you hear jetpack Stein

971
00:59:34,820 --> 00:59:39,710
and Jeffrey Green. Stand up if
you're here and Allison heights,

972
00:59:40,390 --> 00:59:45,350
then I'll put you here. No, Aspen
Heights. Okay. And perhaps add theirs.

973
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:49,910
And John Robinson. John Robinson.
All right, so these people,

974
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:52,050
these people want him to come. We
get to that. Can we get good at that?

975
00:59:52,110 --> 00:59:55,030
Up to the camera. Can see you.
There you go. There you go.

976
00:59:55,050 --> 00:59:58,820
Then all the way around and around
wave. Wave to mom at home. All right,

977
00:59:59,090 --> 01:00:00,710
can we get a round of
applause for our winners?

978
01:00:01,100 --> 01:00:06,100
[inaudible]

979
01:00:09,080 --> 01:00:12,500
so jade has, has, uh,
trustworthy brought back the $5.

980
01:00:12,501 --> 01:00:15,470
I've got to focus for a second
just to get it here is the $5.

981
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:18,530
We're going to tie this into nine pieces,
except I get arrested and deported.

982
01:00:18,531 --> 01:00:21,230
They do that. So we're going to find a
way to break this into change later. Okay.

983
01:00:21,231 --> 01:00:24,830
And come and come and claim it
afterwards. All right, but you're on,

984
01:00:24,850 --> 01:00:27,840
you're on title or whatever.
Whatever, whatever that fraction,

985
01:00:28,130 --> 01:00:31,970
whatever that fraction
of $5. All right. Okay.

986
01:00:31,971 --> 01:00:34,550
So why was this after all that work?

987
01:00:34,580 --> 01:00:37,850
Why was it that one
wasn't the winning answer?

988
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:41,870
Why wasn't one the winning arcs? Let's
have some where we haven't had before.

989
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:45,130
Can we? Uh, um, we got the
mic in way in the backpack.

990
01:00:45,300 --> 01:00:48,920
Got Mike and they told you on the road
you're on. See if you can put, actually,

991
01:00:48,921 --> 01:00:52,760
yeah, you're good as stand up, shouts,
stand up, shower, go, shied away.

992
01:00:53,140 --> 01:00:55,140
Uh, when would have been
the winning answer? Loud.

993
01:00:55,150 --> 01:00:58,240
Louder one would've been
the winning answer had. Um,

994
01:00:58,630 --> 01:01:01,250
everyone assumed that the,

995
01:01:01,540 --> 01:01:04,870
the average would have been
constantly compounded down to one.

996
01:01:04,900 --> 01:01:09,220
But since a couple of people chose the,
I mean,

997
01:01:09,221 --> 01:01:12,940
not incorrect answers, but
the higher averages, they,

998
01:01:13,300 --> 01:01:16,540
let's push that to 13. So to get all
the way. Good. So to get all the way.

999
01:01:16,570 --> 01:01:19,390
Thank you. So get all the way
to one. We need a lot, right?

1000
01:01:19,391 --> 01:01:21,450
We need not just that
you're all rational players,

1001
01:01:21,460 --> 01:01:23,650
not as you know each other's rational,
but you knew everyone else. Restaurant.

1002
01:01:23,740 --> 01:01:26,050
I mean, I know you will know each
other cause you made at Yale,

1003
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:28,150
but you also know each other well enough
to know that not everyone in the room

1004
01:01:28,151 --> 01:01:28,691
is brash on,

1005
01:01:28,691 --> 01:01:30,880
you're pretty sure that not everyone
knows that you're rational and so on,

1006
01:01:30,881 --> 01:01:34,870
so forth. Right? So it's
wrong. It's asking a lot to
get to one here. And in fact,

1007
01:01:34,871 --> 01:01:38,110
we didn't get to one. It had been
previous years we were even higher.

1008
01:01:38,120 --> 01:01:39,610
This was the low, that's
where the low, this year,

1009
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:43,570
in 2003 the average was 18 and a half.

1010
01:01:43,571 --> 01:01:45,610
And in 2004 it was 21 and a half.

1011
01:01:45,700 --> 01:01:48,940
And in 2005 we had a class that
didn't trust each other at all.

1012
01:01:48,941 --> 01:01:52,750
I guess because the average was 23 all
right. And this year it was 13 a third.

1013
01:01:52,751 --> 01:01:57,160
Okay. We're getting better there, I think.
All right. One Nice thing. By the way,

1014
01:01:57,161 --> 01:01:57,971
this is just chance.

1015
01:01:57,971 --> 01:02:02,450
I think the media announcer in the class
was nine which is spot on to the median.

1016
01:02:02,470 --> 01:02:04,710
Hit this, hit this, bang up. All right,

1017
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:08,380
now what I want you to do is
I want you all to play again.

1018
01:02:08,980 --> 01:02:11,220
We haven't got time to do this properly,
even though I've given you this,

1019
01:02:11,260 --> 01:02:15,190
the sheets, so write down, but
don't tell us your neighbors.

1020
01:02:15,430 --> 01:02:17,180
Write down a number.

1021
01:02:19,530 --> 01:02:21,570
Don't talk about yourself.
That's cheating right down a number.

1022
01:02:24,580 --> 01:02:26,850
If you haven't got a sheet in front of
you, just write down on your notepad.

1023
01:02:26,851 --> 01:02:30,870
Write down a number. Has everyone
written down a number? All right,

1024
01:02:30,871 --> 01:02:34,820
I'm going to do a show of hands now.
How many [inaudible], right? Well guys,

1025
01:02:34,950 --> 01:02:35,850
we'll get the camera on you.

1026
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:42,060
How many of you chose a
number higher than 67 Oh,

1027
01:02:42,061 --> 01:02:45,210
there's the spoil makers. They're not.
Okay. How many of you chose a number?

1028
01:02:45,420 --> 01:02:46,560
Higher than 20

1029
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:51,180
how many of you is a
number higher than 10?

1030
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:56,220
How many times a number
between five and 10.

1031
01:02:57,900 --> 01:03:01,080
How many of you choose a number between
zero. Which I between one and five.

1032
01:03:02,670 --> 01:03:03,740
All right.

1033
01:03:04,430 --> 01:03:07,340
How many of you, excluding the
people who chose one last time,

1034
01:03:07,580 --> 01:03:10,520
how many of you chose a number that was
lower than the number you chose last

1035
01:03:10,521 --> 01:03:11,354
time?

1036
01:03:11,970 --> 01:03:14,770
I keep your hands up a second.
All right,

1037
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:19,030
so almost all of you came down.
Why?

1038
01:03:19,210 --> 01:03:22,210
Why are we seeing this
massive contraction?

1039
01:03:22,211 --> 01:03:25,210
I'm guessing the average number in the
class now it's put about three or four,

1040
01:03:25,211 --> 01:03:26,530
maybe even low,
right?

1041
01:03:26,560 --> 01:03:29,320
Why are we seeing this massive
contraction in the numbers being chosen?

1042
01:03:30,220 --> 01:03:32,380
The woman in greening, I
forgot your name. I'm sorry.

1043
01:03:35,570 --> 01:03:38,120
Told us we're not being rational
if we pick a high number.

1044
01:03:38,370 --> 01:03:39,280
All right.
All right,

1045
01:03:39,281 --> 01:03:44,281
so part of it is you yourselves have
figured out some of you that you shouldn't

1046
01:03:44,471 --> 01:03:48,670
choose a high number, right?
What else though? What else?

1047
01:03:48,850 --> 01:03:52,420
What else is going on here? Let's
get somebody, uh, um, there's,

1048
01:03:52,540 --> 01:03:55,540
there's a guy waving his arm out value.
You want to stand up behind the hat?

1049
01:03:55,590 --> 01:03:56,950
Hi. Yeah, yeah, Yup, Yup, Yup.

1050
01:03:59,180 --> 01:04:03,070
Because we've repeated the game. It's
true. We repeated it, but it's true.

1051
01:04:03,071 --> 01:04:03,591
We repeated it.

1052
01:04:03,591 --> 01:04:06,680
But one of what is it about repeating
or what is it about talking about this

1053
01:04:06,681 --> 01:04:09,350
game that makes a difference?
I mean has it the here.

1054
01:04:09,620 --> 01:04:14,150
I think what makes the difference is not
only do you yourselves know better how

1055
01:04:14,151 --> 01:04:15,290
to play this game now,

1056
01:04:16,040 --> 01:04:21,040
but you also know that everybody around
you knows better how to play the game.

1057
01:04:21,980 --> 01:04:26,980
Discussing this game raise not
just each person's sophistication,

1058
01:04:28,220 --> 01:04:31,850
but it raised what you know about
other people's sophistication.

1059
01:04:32,210 --> 01:04:35,510
And you know that other people now know
that you understand how the play the

1060
01:04:35,511 --> 01:04:36,344
game.

1061
01:04:36,650 --> 01:04:41,600
So the main lesson I wanted to get from
this is that not only does it matter

1062
01:04:41,630 --> 01:04:44,540
that you need to put yourself in other
people's shoes and think about what their

1063
01:04:44,541 --> 01:04:45,630
payoffs are.
Huh?

1064
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:50,990
You also need to put yourself into
other people's shoes and think about how

1065
01:04:50,991 --> 01:04:54,170
sophisticated are they at playing games.

1066
01:04:54,740 --> 01:04:59,330
And you need to think
about how sophisticated do
they think you are playing

1067
01:04:59,331 --> 01:05:03,080
games and you need to think about how
sophisticated do they think that you think

1068
01:05:03,081 --> 01:05:07,670
that they are playing games
and so on, right? This level
of knowledge, this, these,

1069
01:05:07,700 --> 01:05:12,060
these layers of knowledge lead to very
different plan the game and to give it,

1070
01:05:12,061 --> 01:05:16,370
make this more concrete. If a firm
is competing against a competitor,

1071
01:05:16,550 --> 01:05:20,710
it can be pretty sure that that competitor
is a pretty sophisticated game player

1072
01:05:20,770 --> 01:05:25,360
and knows that the firm is itself.
If a firm is competing against a customer,

1073
01:05:25,630 --> 01:05:30,250
let's say for a non prime loan, perhaps
that assumption is not quite so safe.

1074
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:31,270
It matters.

1075
01:05:31,390 --> 01:05:34,510
It matters and how we take gain through
to the real world and we're going to see

1076
01:05:34,511 --> 01:05:38,410
more of this as the term progresses.
Now I've got five minutes.

1077
01:05:38,411 --> 01:05:42,520
Do I have five minutes left? I've got,
so I've got five minutes to district.

1078
01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:44,200
A little small aside here.

1079
01:05:44,830 --> 01:05:49,150
We've been talking about knowledge and
about common knowledge and I just want to

1080
01:05:49,151 --> 01:05:51,280
do a very quick experiment to
everyone stay in their seat.

1081
01:05:52,570 --> 01:05:55,700
I'm going to get two TA's up here.
I want to get la and and uh,

1082
01:05:55,710 --> 01:06:00,710
and up here and we're going to sh I wanted
to show that common knowledge is not

1083
01:06:01,181 --> 01:06:04,360
such an obvious a concept as I've
made against him on the board.

1084
01:06:05,110 --> 01:06:09,770
Come up on stage a second. You can
leave the mic. It's okay. All right.

1085
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:13,900
Here we have two of our tas actually is
the two head TA's and I want you to face

1086
01:06:13,901 --> 01:06:16,690
forwards. You don't see what I'm
doing exactly. Okay. All right.

1087
01:06:16,750 --> 01:06:20,040
I'm about to put on their heads a hat.

1088
01:06:21,790 --> 01:06:23,020
All right.
All right,

1089
01:06:23,021 --> 01:06:28,000
here's a hat on his head and
here's an a hat on Kaiser.

1090
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,820
It's moving this way so they're in focus.
All right.

1091
01:06:31,180 --> 01:06:34,330
Now you can all see these hats and they
can see that and if they turn around to

1092
01:06:34,331 --> 01:06:37,620
each other, they can see
each other's have. All right.

1093
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:42,410
Now I want to ask you the question here.
Here is the facts.

1094
01:06:43,330 --> 01:06:46,990
All right,
so is it,

1095
01:06:47,170 --> 01:06:48,790
is it common knowledge?

1096
01:06:48,970 --> 01:06:53,970
Is it common knowledge that isn't common
knowledge that at least one of these

1097
01:06:53,981 --> 01:06:57,580
people has a pink hat on their head?

1098
01:06:58,840 --> 01:07:03,130
Is it common knowledge?
So I claim it's not common knowledge.

1099
01:07:03,850 --> 01:07:05,830
What is known here?
Well,

1100
01:07:05,860 --> 01:07:10,860
I'll reveal the fact that you've now
that in fact Allie knows that Chi has a

1101
01:07:12,101 --> 01:07:13,240
pink hat on his head.

1102
01:07:13,540 --> 01:07:16,280
So it's true that Allie knows that that
is one person in the room has a pink

1103
01:07:16,281 --> 01:07:18,310
capital in their head.
And it's true.

1104
01:07:18,311 --> 01:07:22,070
That kind knows that Allie has a pink
hat on his head. They both look absurd,

1105
01:07:22,071 --> 01:07:22,904
but never mind.

1106
01:07:24,280 --> 01:07:29,280
But gnosis that Allie doesn't know
the color of the hat on his own head.

1107
01:07:30,950 --> 01:07:35,260
Right. So even though both people know,
even though it is mutual knowledge,

1108
01:07:35,560 --> 01:07:37,870
that there's at least
one, perhaps pink cat, uh,

1109
01:07:38,210 --> 01:07:42,580
in the Roman lay doesn't
know what kind of seeing.

1110
01:07:42,760 --> 01:07:47,380
So Allie does not know that Chi in knows
that there's a pink hat on the room.

1111
01:07:47,620 --> 01:07:51,640
In fact, from audience point of view,
this could be a blue hat. So again,

1112
01:07:51,820 --> 01:07:55,390
they both knew that someone in the
room has a pink hat on their head.

1113
01:07:55,450 --> 01:07:59,680
It is mutual knowledge that there's a fee.
There's a pink hat in the Roman,

1114
01:08:00,190 --> 01:08:02,470
but Allie does not know that.

1115
01:08:02,471 --> 01:08:07,390
Kind of knows that he's wearing a blue or
a pink hat, and Chi does not know that.

1116
01:08:07,391 --> 01:08:10,960
Allie knows that Kai
is wearing a pink hat.

1117
01:08:11,380 --> 01:08:16,220
Each of our hats, each that own
hats might be blue. So notice that.

1118
01:08:16,240 --> 01:08:19,880
Common Knowledge. Thanks guys. Common
Knowledge is a rather subtle thing.

1119
01:08:19,881 --> 01:08:22,970
Thank you. All right, come on.
Now. There's a subtle thing.

1120
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:26,060
Mutual knowledge doesn't
imply common knowledge.

1121
01:08:26,300 --> 01:08:30,470
Common knowledge is a statement about
not what I know it's about what do I know

1122
01:08:30,471 --> 01:08:33,980
the other person knows that I know that
the other person and so on and so forth.

1123
01:08:34,220 --> 01:08:37,610
And even in this simple example where
you might think it's all vs become a

1124
01:08:37,611 --> 01:08:40,820
knowledge, it wasn't common knowledge
because there was a pink hat on the road.

1125
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:44,240
Does anybody have a smaller
siblings or children or their own?

1126
01:08:44,330 --> 01:08:46,460
They can have a pink cat at the
end of the class. All right,

1127
01:08:46,490 --> 01:08:47,480
we'll see you on Wednesday.
