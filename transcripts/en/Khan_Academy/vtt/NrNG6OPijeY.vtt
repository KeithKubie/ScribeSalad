00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:01.920
- [Voiceover] Two blocks are connected by

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:03.963
a string of negligible mass that passes

00:00:03.963 --> 00:00:06.472
over massless pulleys that turn with

00:00:06.472 --> 00:00:07.981
negligible friction, as shown in

00:00:07.981 --> 00:00:10.431
the figure above, we see that there.

00:00:10.431 --> 00:00:14.228
The mass m2 of block 2 is greater

00:00:14.228 --> 00:00:17.026
than the mass m1 of block 1.

00:00:17.026 --> 00:00:20.149
The blocks are released from rest.

00:00:20.149 --> 00:00:21.402
So let's just really quick think about

00:00:21.402 --> 00:00:23.642
what we think is going to happen here.

00:00:23.642 --> 00:00:26.090
Block 2 has a larger
mass, they're connected

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:29.726
by this string and pulley system here.

00:00:29.726 --> 00:00:31.166
Well if it has a larger
mass, they're in the

00:00:31.166 --> 00:00:32.803
same gravitational
field, it's going to have

00:00:32.803 --> 00:00:35.090
a larger weight and so the weight

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:36.669
pulling down on block 2 is going to be

00:00:36.669 --> 00:00:40.245
larger than the weight
pulling down on block 1

00:00:40.245 --> 00:00:41.742
and so you're going to have block 2

00:00:41.742 --> 00:00:43.983
accelerating downwards, you're going

00:00:43.983 --> 00:00:47.129
to have block 2 accelerating downwards

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.150
and block 1 is going to accelerate upwards

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:51.309
with the same magnitude.

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:54.735
So block 1 is going to accelerate upwards

00:00:54.735 --> 00:00:56.371
and so with that just intuition

00:00:56.371 --> 00:00:58.008
of what we think is going to happen here

00:00:58.008 --> 00:01:00.968
let's try to tackle part A of this.

00:01:00.968 --> 00:01:03.849
So they tell us the
dots below, these dots,

00:01:03.849 --> 00:01:05.997
represent the two blocks, so this

00:01:05.997 --> 00:01:08.876
represents block 1,
this represents block 2.

00:01:08.876 --> 00:01:11.069
Draw free-body diagrams
showing and labeling

00:01:11.069 --> 00:01:14.494
the forces, not components,
exerted on each block.

00:01:14.494 --> 00:01:16.793
Draw the relative lengths of all vectors

00:01:16.793 --> 00:01:20.705
to reflect the relative
magnitudes of all forces.

00:01:20.705 --> 00:01:22.528
Alright, so let's think about what are

00:01:22.528 --> 00:01:26.185
all the forces acting
on each of these blocks.

00:01:26.185 --> 00:01:27.925
Well for each of these blocks you're going

00:01:27.925 --> 00:01:29.912
to have the force of gravity, you're going

00:01:29.912 --> 00:01:33.128
to have the weight of the
blocks acting on them,

00:01:33.128 --> 00:01:38.128
so for example this first block m1,

00:01:38.234 --> 00:01:40.800
m1, and I'll draw it here first,

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.629
what is the force of gravity going to be?

00:01:44.629 --> 00:01:46.096
The force of gravity is going to be

00:01:46.096 --> 00:01:50.311
its mass times the gravitational field.

00:01:50.311 --> 00:01:54.607
Now what is going to be the
force of gravity on block 2?

00:01:54.607 --> 00:01:56.244
Well it's going to be larger than that

00:01:56.244 --> 00:01:58.995
so let me just draw it like this,

00:01:58.995 --> 00:02:01.317
so the force of gravity is going to be

00:02:01.317 --> 00:02:04.045
m2 times g, how did I know
it was going to be larger?

00:02:04.045 --> 00:02:06.699
Well m2 has a larger mass and we are

00:02:06.699 --> 00:02:09.119
in the same gravitational field.

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.023
Now we're not done there, no not done yet

00:02:12.023 --> 00:02:15.088
because now we also have the upward

00:02:15.088 --> 00:02:18.918
pulling force of the tension in the string

00:02:18.918 --> 00:02:20.543
and we could think
about what the magnitude

00:02:20.543 --> 00:02:22.285
of that, we know that the, we know that

00:02:22.285 --> 00:02:24.282
the tension is going to be pulling upwards

00:02:24.282 --> 00:02:26.226
on both of the blocks
but let's think about

00:02:26.226 --> 00:02:28.067
what its magnitude is going to be.

00:02:28.067 --> 00:02:30.459
In order for block 1
to accelerate upwards,

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:33.198
which is in our intuition
as to what would happen,

00:02:33.198 --> 00:02:35.625
the tension, the force of the tension

00:02:35.625 --> 00:02:38.299
has to be larger, the
magnitude of the tension

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:41.708
has to be larger than the
magnitude of the weight.

00:02:41.708 --> 00:02:45.481
Now in order for block 2
to accelerate downwards

00:02:45.481 --> 00:02:48.024
the magnitude of the
tension has to be less than

00:02:48.024 --> 00:02:50.723
the downward force of gravity, the upward

00:02:50.723 --> 00:02:52.704
force of tension has to be less than

00:02:52.704 --> 00:02:54.502
the downward force of gravity.

00:02:54.502 --> 00:02:56.279
So the magnitude of the tension

00:02:56.279 --> 00:02:58.788
is going to be inbetween the magnitudes

00:02:58.788 --> 00:03:02.918
of these two weights, so let me draw that.

00:03:02.918 --> 00:03:05.126
So the magnitude of the
tension is going to be

00:03:05.126 --> 00:03:09.398
larger than m1g but smaller than m2g,

00:03:09.398 --> 00:03:13.078
so maybe like that, so
that is tension right there

00:03:13.078 --> 00:03:17.966
and, whoops, and you're going to have

00:03:17.966 --> 00:03:20.618
on this side you're going to have the same

00:03:20.618 --> 00:03:24.469
magnitude of your tension pulling upwards

00:03:24.469 --> 00:03:26.453
but it's now less than the weight,

00:03:26.453 --> 00:03:29.135
which means that the block is
going to accelerate downwards

00:03:29.135 --> 00:03:31.075
and we know that these two tensions,

00:03:31.075 --> 00:03:32.931
the magnitudes of these tension vectors

00:03:32.931 --> 00:03:34.592
are going to be the same because of

00:03:34.592 --> 00:03:36.368
the magnitude of the tension throughout

00:03:36.368 --> 00:03:39.166
this entire string is
going to be the same.

00:03:39.166 --> 00:03:41.686
When you think about
tension, this pulling force,

00:03:41.686 --> 00:03:43.272
you can think about what's happening at an

00:03:43.272 --> 00:03:46.905
atomic or a molecular level
is these are the, you know

00:03:46.905 --> 00:03:48.904
the covalent bonds pulling on each other

00:03:48.904 --> 00:03:51.945
at an atomic level
throughout the entire string

00:03:51.945 --> 00:03:54.186
and when we look at it on a macro level

00:03:54.186 --> 00:03:55.997
we view that as tension.

00:03:55.997 --> 00:03:57.681
So there you have it, I've drawn

00:03:57.681 --> 00:03:59.063
the forces on them but I haven't

00:03:59.063 --> 00:04:00.224
drawn them in the right place,

00:04:00.224 --> 00:04:01.698
I need to draw them on this,

00:04:01.698 --> 00:04:03.626
I need to draw them right over here.

00:04:03.626 --> 00:04:04.623
So let me draw that, I can actually

00:04:04.623 --> 00:04:06.202
draw a little bit more precisely

00:04:06.202 --> 00:04:09.465
because they gave us these lines.

00:04:09.465 --> 00:04:14.260
So on block 1 I have the weight

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:18.758
so that is m1g,

00:04:18.758 --> 00:04:20.778
I also have the tension,

00:04:20.778 --> 00:04:23.536
I'll make that two of these lines tall,

00:04:23.536 --> 00:04:26.706
so I also have the tension.

00:04:26.706 --> 00:04:29.062
Now block 2 I have the same tension

00:04:29.062 --> 00:04:31.293
or same magnitude of tension I should say,

00:04:31.293 --> 00:04:35.982
now it's also pulling upwards, so tension,

00:04:35.982 --> 00:04:37.816
and I have its weight, which is going

00:04:37.816 --> 00:04:39.851
to be larger than the tension,

00:04:39.851 --> 00:04:44.422
so its weight, I'll make
it three of these lines.

00:04:44.422 --> 00:04:46.721
The way I've drawn it m2 would have

00:04:46.721 --> 00:04:49.043
to be three times, m2 would have to be

00:04:49.043 --> 00:04:51.386
three times larger than
m1 the way I've drawn it.

00:04:51.386 --> 00:04:53.881
They don't tell us that, they
tell us that m2 is larger

00:04:53.881 --> 00:04:55.966
so this seems to be right.

00:04:55.966 --> 00:04:58.018
And we just want to get our intuition here

00:04:58.018 --> 00:05:01.141
since our tension, our upward force

00:05:01.141 --> 00:05:02.279
is larger than our downward force

00:05:02.279 --> 00:05:04.043
you're going to have a net upward force,

00:05:04.043 --> 00:05:06.435
which is going to accelerate block 1 up

00:05:06.435 --> 00:05:07.956
and here you're going to
have a net downward force,

00:05:07.956 --> 00:05:10.557
which is going to accelerate block 2 down,

00:05:10.557 --> 00:05:12.925
which is in line with our intuition

00:05:12.925 --> 00:05:17.088
because block 2 weighs more than block 1.
