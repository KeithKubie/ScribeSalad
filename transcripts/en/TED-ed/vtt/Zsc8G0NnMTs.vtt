00:00:06.928 --> 00:00:10.740
Imagine aliens land on the planet
a million years from now

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.579
and look into the geologic record.

00:00:13.579 --> 00:00:17.239
What will these curious 
searchers find of us?

00:00:17.239 --> 00:00:21.140
They will find what geologists, 
scientists, and other experts

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.169
are increasingly calling
the Anthropocene,

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:27.147
or new age of mankind.

00:00:27.147 --> 00:00:31.168
The impacts that we humans make
have become so pervasive,

00:00:31.168 --> 00:00:32.141
profound,

00:00:32.141 --> 00:00:33.478
and permanent

00:00:33.478 --> 00:00:38.838
that some geologists argue
we merit our own epoch.

00:00:38.838 --> 00:00:42.019
That would be a new unit
in the geologic time scale

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:46.621
that stretches back 
more than 4.5 billion years,

00:00:46.621 --> 00:00:49.700
or ever since the Earth took shape.

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:54.751
Modern humans may be on par
with the glaciers behind various ice ages

00:00:54.751 --> 00:00:59.320
or the asteroid that doomed
most of the dinosaurs.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.399
What is an epoch?

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:04.142
Most simply, it's a unit of geologic time.

00:01:04.142 --> 00:01:05.726
There's the Pleistocene,

00:01:05.726 --> 00:01:09.781
an icy epoch that saw the evolution
of modern humans.

00:01:09.781 --> 00:01:13.680
Or there's the Eocene, 
more than 34 million years ago,

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.743
a hothouse time during which

00:01:15.743 --> 00:01:19.531
the continents drifted 
into their present configuration.

00:01:19.531 --> 00:01:22.971
Changes in climate or fossils
found in the rock record

00:01:22.971 --> 00:01:28.681
help distinguish these epochs
and help geologists tell deep time.

00:01:28.681 --> 00:01:33.063
So what will be the record 
of modern people's impact on the planet?

00:01:33.063 --> 00:01:37.601
It doesn't rely on the things
that may seem most obvious to us today,

00:01:37.601 --> 00:01:39.451
like sprawling cities.

00:01:39.451 --> 00:01:42.813
Even New York or Shanghai 
may prove hard to find

00:01:42.813 --> 00:01:45.993
buried in the rocks 
a million years from now.

00:01:45.993 --> 00:01:48.591
But humans have put new things
into the world

00:01:48.591 --> 00:01:51.054
that never existed on Earth before,

00:01:51.054 --> 00:01:52.313
like plutonium

00:01:52.313 --> 00:01:54.275
and plastics.

00:01:54.275 --> 00:01:57.252
In fact, the geologists 
known as stratigraphers

00:01:57.252 --> 00:01:59.594
who determine the geologic timescale,

00:01:59.594 --> 00:02:04.864
have proposed a start date
for the Anthropocene around 1950.

00:02:04.864 --> 00:02:09.032
That's when people started blowing up
nuclear bombs all around the world

00:02:09.032 --> 00:02:12.503
and scattering novel elements 
to the winds.

00:02:12.503 --> 00:02:15.013
Those elements will last 
in the rock record,

00:02:15.013 --> 00:02:18.474
even in our bones and teeth
for millions of years.

00:02:18.474 --> 00:02:21.894
And in just 50 years, 
we've made enough plastic,

00:02:21.894 --> 00:02:24.474
at least 8 billion metric tons,

00:02:24.474 --> 00:02:28.316
to cover the whole world in a thin film.

00:02:28.316 --> 00:02:34.004
People's farming, fishing, and forestry
will also show up as a before and after

00:02:34.004 --> 00:02:35.914
in any such strata

00:02:35.914 --> 00:02:37.784
because it's those kinds of activities

00:02:37.784 --> 00:02:43.325
that are causing unique species 
of plants and animals to die out.

00:02:43.325 --> 00:02:47.267
This die-off started perhaps more than
40,000 years ago

00:02:47.267 --> 00:02:49.876
as humanity spread out of Africa

00:02:49.876 --> 00:02:52.471
and reached places like Australia,

00:02:52.471 --> 00:02:58.025
kicking off the disappearance
of big, likable, and edible animals.

00:02:58.025 --> 00:03:01.965
This is true of Europe and Asia,
think woolly mammoth,

00:03:01.965 --> 00:03:04.735
as well as North and South America, too.

00:03:04.735 --> 00:03:06.301
For a species that has only roamed

00:03:06.301 --> 00:03:08.836
the planet for 
a few hundred thousand years,

00:03:08.836 --> 00:03:13.720
Homo sapiens has had a big impact
on the future fossil record.

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.700
That also means that even if people
were to disappear tomorrow,

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.778
evolution would be driven 
by our choices to date.

00:03:21.778 --> 00:03:27.326
We're making a new homogenous world
of certain favored plants and animals,

00:03:27.326 --> 00:03:29.457
like corn and rats.

00:03:29.457 --> 00:03:33.036
But it's a world that's not as resilient
as the one it replaces.

00:03:33.036 --> 00:03:35.018
As the fossil record shows,

00:03:35.018 --> 00:03:37.426
it's a diversity of plants and animals

00:03:37.426 --> 00:03:40.557
that allows unique pairings 
of flora and fauna

00:03:40.557 --> 00:03:46.417
to respond to environmental challenges,
and even thrive after an apocalypse.

00:03:46.417 --> 00:03:48.357
That goes for people, too.

00:03:48.357 --> 00:03:51.098
If the microscopic plants 
of the ocean suffer

00:03:51.098 --> 00:03:53.988
as a result of too much 
carbon dioxide, say,

00:03:53.988 --> 00:03:59.847
we'll lose the source of as much as half
of the oxygen we need to breathe.

00:03:59.847 --> 00:04:04.088
Then there's the smudge in future rocks.

00:04:04.088 --> 00:04:07.843
People's penchant for burning coal,
oil, and natural gas

00:04:07.843 --> 00:04:12.057
has spread tiny bits of soot
all over the planet.

00:04:12.057 --> 00:04:15.439
That smudge corresponds 
with a meteoric rise

00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:18.590
in the amount 
of carbon dioxide in the air,

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:21.681
now beyond 400 parts per million,

00:04:21.681 --> 00:04:26.300
or higher than any other Homo sapiens
has ever breathed.

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.520
Similar soot can still 
be found in ancient rocks

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:34.000
from volcanic fires 
of 66 million years ago,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.169
a record of the cataclysm touched off
by an asteroid

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:40.431
at the end of the late Cretaceous epoch.

00:04:40.431 --> 00:04:45.291
So odds are our soot will still be here
66 million years from now,

00:04:45.291 --> 00:04:49.751
easy enough to find for any aliens
who care to look.

00:04:49.751 --> 00:04:54.152
Of course, there's an important
difference between us and an asteroid.

00:04:54.152 --> 00:04:57.369
A space rock has no choice
but to follow gravity.

00:04:57.369 --> 00:04:59.900
We can choose to do differently.

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:04.643
And if we do, there might still be
some kind of human civilization thousands

00:05:04.643 --> 00:05:07.131
or even millions of years from now.

00:05:07.131 --> 00:05:09.801
Not a bad record to hope for.
