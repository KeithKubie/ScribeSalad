BRIAN FITZPATRICK:
Good afternoon.

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:04.250
My name is Brian Fitzpatrick,
and most people call me Fitz.

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:05.960
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: And I am
Ben Collins-Sussman, and many

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:07.890
people call me Ben
Collins-Sussman.

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.110
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: You've
probably seen us doing a lot

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:10.775
of the Ask a Google
Engineer videos.

00:00:10.775 --> 00:00:14.090
And we've been giving talks at
Google I/O for the entire

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:15.910
duration of Google I/O
for five years now.

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:17.560
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: And today
we get to interview some

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.450
wonderful folks here
at Google I/O 2012.

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:22.060
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: And these
guys are actually organizers

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.250
of Google Developer Groups
from around the world.

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:25.930
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: I'm very
excited to talk to them and

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:29.020
learn about their experiences by
organizing Google Developer

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:29.760
Communities.

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.740
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: So let's
get our first guest on.

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.740
Come right on in.

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:34.300
Hi, welcome.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:34.690
What's your name?

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:36.630
BADRI KULKARNI: Hi,
my name is Badri.

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:37.740
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: And Badri,
tell us where are you from,

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:38.400
and what do you do?

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.110
BADRI KULKARNI: Yeah, sure.

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.010
I'm from GDG Bangalore, India.

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.040
So I co-organize along with
one of my organizers, GDG

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.240
Bangalore chapter.

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.570
So we conduct a lot of events
around Google technologies.

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:54.490
So to give you a brief idea
about our GDG chapter and tell

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:58.220
you how GDG helps developers
connect together, so I would

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:59.690
like to share you
my experiences

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.560
with a GDG, GDG Bangalore.

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:07.140
So we started a year ago, last
year around September.

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.450
So from that point to this
point, we had a lot of events

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:15.200
around Google technologies, some
of them being the Google

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.050
App Engine, Android.

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:21.010
And one of them exciting was
Dart Hackathon, which was part

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:25.110
of a global Dart Hackathon
window.

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.985
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: But you guys
organized the one, right?

00:01:26.985 --> 00:01:27.390
BADRI KULKARNI: Yeah.

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:28.280
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: You
were the organizer?

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:29.210
BADRI KULKARNI: Yes, yes.

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.560
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Great.

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.810
BADRI KULKARNI: So these are
kind of the events that we had

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.200
in our Meetup, the last
one being a big one.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.890
It's called DevFestX.

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.660
So DevFestX actually gave a
platform to all the developers

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:42.710
in and around Bangalore City
to come to the event and

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.000
interact with other people,
other developers which are of

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.660
like mind, and share
their knowledge.

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:51.030
So it was a great, great
experience, great event.

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.290
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Were there
any wonderful collaborations

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:55.840
or products that came out of
that DevFestX experience?

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:56.500
BADRI KULKARNI: Yeah,
there are.

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:57.030
There are many.

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.320
I would like to take
an example of the

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.370
Dart Hackathon event.

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.730
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Sure.

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:01.960
BADRI KULKARNI: So that was
first time that the developer

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.110
way of coding on that day,
because nobody has previously

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.130
done that, because it's a new
technology from Google.

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:10.080
So we had this Dart Hackathon.

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.020
Around 30 people came up.

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.530
30 participants--

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:13.080
members--

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.770
came up.

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.510
And on the spot, on the event
day, they collaborated.

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.800
They made themes among
themselves.

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.010
And at the end of the day, we
had around seven demos.

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:25.290
So that's pretty awesome.

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.930
So these guys are still
continuing on that, and trying

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:30.900
around these Dart
APIs, and giving

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.420
feedback to the Dart team.

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:33.530
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: So it sounds
like you're involved

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:34.996
with all sorts of different
Google technologies.

00:02:34.996 --> 00:02:36.150
BADRI KULKARNI: Yes.

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.200
Whatever you find it on

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.660
developers.google.com, we are there.

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:40.890
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Now,
I heard that you're also

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:41.760
interested in Android.

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:42.410
Is that true?

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:43.035
Is that one of your--

00:02:43.035 --> 00:02:43.290
BADRI KULKARNI: Yes.

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:44.540
I'm an Android developer.

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.900
So we do conduct of a lot of
events around Android.

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.755
So the one that I was mentioning
something,

00:02:49.755 --> 00:02:51.930
DevFestX, there we
had a different

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.820
track for Android itself.

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:58.080
So what GDG gives all the
developers is a platform

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.680
wherein all the people who
are working on Google

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.770
technologies, directly or
indirectly, are actually

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:06.090
interested in working on these
technologies, can come and

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.360
join other people who are doing
the exact same thing.

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.230
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: So you're
bringing people together.

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.670
So as an organizer, what
would you say?

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.510
If you're going to give advice
to other people out there who

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.690
were going to organize GDGs or
something, what kind of advice

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:19.641
would you give them?

00:03:19.641 --> 00:03:22.570
BADRI KULKARNI: Yeah, what I'd
like to tell is, GDG is a

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:23.730
great platform.

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.280
So it will enable each and every
person who is really

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.270
interested in Google
technologies, it will help you

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:31.270
connect with other people
globally, not

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.920
only in your area.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.770
It will help you to
connect globally.

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:36.175
And it's a great place to learn,
share, and work with

00:03:36.175 --> 00:03:36.970
other people.

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:37.620
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: This
goes back to what

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:38.460
we always talk about.

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:41.100
It's not underestimating the
power of a face-to-face

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.520
connection.

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:42.305
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Right,
that high bandwidth.

00:03:42.305 --> 00:03:44.690
It's much better than a bulletin
board, a forum, or an

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.010
email list, having people right
there in front of you.

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:48.500
BADRI KULKARNI: I would like
to tell one more example.

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.380
It's not like you have
to be in person.

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:54.110
We have had Meetups wherein some
of the people gave a talk

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:55.110
or something via Hangout.

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:56.430
So that's pretty awesome.

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.980
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: So you're
looping people in, who can't

00:03:58.980 --> 00:03:59.940
come in, through a Hangout.

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:00.385
BADRI KULKARNI: Yeah, true.

00:04:00.385 --> 00:04:00.830
Yeah.

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:01.300
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: OK.

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:03.130
Oh, that sounds-- is that
really effective?

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:04.160
Do you find that works
really well?

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.653
BADRI KULKARNI: Definitely,
yeah.

00:04:04.653 --> 00:04:05.056
We have done that.

00:04:05.056 --> 00:04:05.460
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Yeah?

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:05.740
Great.

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:07.410
Well listen, thanks so
much for coming.

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:08.440
It was great talking to you.

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.300
Enjoy your conference.

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:12.520
We've got a couple more people
we're going to bring in here.

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:13.450
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN:
Next country.

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:14.400
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Next country,
yeah, exactly.

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:15.240
Next continent, actually.

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:16.050
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN:
Wonderful.

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:17.170
Hi, what is your name?

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:19.050
AYGUL ZAGIDULLINA:
My name is Aygul.

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:20.209
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: And
where are you from?

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:20.940
Tell us what you do.

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:22.370
AYGUL ZAGIDULLINA: I am
from Germany, and I'm

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:23.620
co-organizing two GTUGs.

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:28.040
In Germany, so GDG Stuttgart,
and in Russia, GDG Ufa.

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:29.280
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: OK, so
you're an overachiever.

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:30.710
We got that, right?

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:32.510
But this isn't your
first I/O, is it?

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:35.032
AYGUL ZAGIDULLINA: No, it's not
my first I/O. I went for

00:04:35.032 --> 00:04:37.370
the first time to Google
I/O last year.

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:38.460
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: And we
heard there was something

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:40.400
special about last year's
event for you.

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:41.690
AYGUL ZAGIDULLINA: Absolutely.

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:44.770
Actually, last Google I/O
was our honeymoon.

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:46.250
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: And you met
your husband, and you guys

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:48.340
went to GTUG meetings
together, right?

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:49.970
That's why you got to know
each other, right?

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:50.425
AYGUL ZAGIDULLINA: Yeah.

00:04:50.425 --> 00:04:53.300
Actually, we met first online.

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:56.720
And then one day we
went to Google--

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:58.630
the GDG organized Hackathon
in Stuttgart.

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:01.240
And we fell in love
with this concept.

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.780
And after three months, we
became co-organizers of the

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:08.170
GTUG, and organized after
that Android DevCamp

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:09.180
and all other events.

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:10.340
So it's real awesome.

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:13.490
We just fell in love
really quickly.

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:15.260
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: So everybody
here is leaving with

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:16.320
hardware, you included.

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:19.160
Last year you left Google I/O
with a husband, right?

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.550
So this is like your big
anniversary party every year.

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:22.340
AYGUL ZAGIDULLINA: Absolutely.

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:22.930
BRIAN FITZPATRICK:
That's great.

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:25.110
So tell us a little more about
the events that you organize

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:27.090
and your GDG work in Germany.

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:28.150
AYGUL ZAGIDULLINA: Actually,
it's a really great

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:29.170
experience.

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:31.070
I can share it in Russia.

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:33.700
Last year we had all the Russian
and CIS countries

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:35.600
Hackathon on Google Chrome.

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:38.250
And we got an awesome
experience, awesome

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:41.600
opportunity to present our
projects on the main stage at

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:43.985
the Google Developer
Day in Moscow.

00:05:43.985 --> 00:05:46.620
So it was a really amazing
experience.

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:47.320
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: What
were some of the

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:48.370
projects that got presented?

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:50.030
I'm curious what came
out of that.

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:52.170
AYGUL ZAGIDULLINA: It was Chrome
extensions with HTML5

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:55.580
apps, and they were really
on a high level.

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:57.050
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: So what's
your favorite Google

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:58.430
technology that you
get to work with?

00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:59.390
AYGUL ZAGIDULLINA: Actually,
Android.

00:05:59.390 --> 00:05:59.860
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Android?

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:00.100
AYGUL ZAGIDULLINA: Yes.

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:01.600
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Are you an
Android developer as well?

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:02.960
AYGUL ZAGIDULLINA: I am
starting to develop.

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:05.300
So I am practicing right now.

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:07.801
And maybe next Google I/O,
I have something

00:06:07.801 --> 00:06:08.960
to share with you.

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:09.880
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: OK.

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:11.410
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Is Android
popular within your

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:12.405
GDG groups as well?

00:06:12.405 --> 00:06:12.660
AYGUL ZAGIDULLINA: Yes.

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:15.570
We actually made a survey, and
we just tried to find out

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:18.250
which technologies are really
popular in our countries.

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:22.520
And Android is absolutely like
first place, and then all

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:25.530
other technologies are
coming after that.

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:27.600
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: So as an
organizer, what would you

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:30.740
advise other people out there
interested in organizing their

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:31.660
own GDG groups?

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:33.210
What would you advise
those guys to do?

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:34.906
What's the most important
thing?

00:06:34.906 --> 00:06:36.670
AYGUL ZAGIDULLINA: Actually,
first of all, it's important

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:41.740
to make regular meetings with
all your guys and to know them

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:42.170
personally.

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:46.090
Not like developers, but also
like people, like a friend.

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:50.260
And my personal opinion is that
developers in one city

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:53.740
should know each other as
friends, not only as

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:55.430
professionals.

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:56.470
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: So you're
talking about building

00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:57.460
communities, right?

00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:58.000
AYGUL ZAGIDULLINA:
Yes, absolutely.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.500
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Not just
a work relationship.

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:00.050
AYGUL ZAGIDULLINA: So we
are meeting each other.

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:01.675
We are going and playing
billiards.

00:07:01.675 --> 00:07:03.260
We are going to the cinema.

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:04.735
So it's really--

00:07:04.735 --> 00:07:06.850
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: I was going
to say, going to bars

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:08.015
and pubs must be part
of it, then.

00:07:08.015 --> 00:07:08.360
AYGUL ZAGIDULLINA: Right.

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:12.545
It should be beyond only
Hackathons, only Tech

00:07:12.545 --> 00:07:14.150
talks, and so on.

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:16.000
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: So are there
any collaborations that

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:16.850
you've seen come out of this?

00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:18.770
People meet each other, and
then start working on apps

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:20.460
together, or start a business
or anything?

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:20.860
AYGUL ZAGIDULLINA: Yes.

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:25.700
Actually, my dream is that one
day we'll make a Tech Talk

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:29.900
from one of our apps or one of
our extensions, because we

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:32.420
have really talented people
in our GTUGs, and

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:33.360
they are really amazing.

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:36.480
They are really young, and they
have so much potential.

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:40.340
And I'm happy that GDGs and
Google's providing this

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:42.920
environment to actually
come them

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:45.730
together and build something.

00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:47.110
BRIAN FITZPATRICK:
That's fabulous.

00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:47.690
Excellent.

00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:48.150
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN:
I'm curious.

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:48.910
One last thing.

00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:51.150
When you guys have meetings,
do you have set agendas or

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:53.060
particular speakers
on technologies?

00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:53.830
AYGUL ZAGIDULLINA: It depends.

00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:57.000
If it's Tech Talks, then we
have invited speakers.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.310
But if it's Hackathons, there
will be just brainstorming,

00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:02.620
and also applications
come out.

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:07.320
Just improvisation, it's also
part of our events.

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:09.330
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: So let's
talk about Hackathons.

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:13.770
What do you do to organize
a Hackathon?

00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:16.946
I mean, is there a lot of
preparation for that?

00:08:16.946 --> 00:08:18.540
AYGUL ZAGIDULLINA: I mean,
a lot of preparation.

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:20.940
Google's already providing
us technology.

00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:22.260
This is the main thing.

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.130
And everything will
come around.

00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:27.710
So we are just, for example,
taking Google+ API and just

00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:28.500
brainstorming.

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:32.039
And a lot of different ideas
coming out, and then we are

00:08:32.039 --> 00:08:33.640
just forming teams.

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:35.350
And people are really
creative.

00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:36.990
And this is actually
interesting, because they are

00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:39.830
technical people, but they
actually can think

00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:41.543
really out of box.

00:08:41.543 --> 00:08:42.490
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN:
That's fantastic.

00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:43.659
Sounds like a great
environment for--

00:08:43.659 --> 00:08:43.990
BRIAN FITZPATRICK:
That's great.

00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:46.150
Well, we're glad to have
you back at I/O again.

00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:47.140
AYGUL ZAGIDULLINA: Yeah,
thank you very much.

00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:48.130
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: And we'll see
you next year, I suppose.

00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:49.050
AYGUL ZAGIDULLINA:
Yeah, see you.

00:08:49.050 --> 00:08:50.390
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: All
right, thanks a lot.

00:08:50.390 --> 00:08:51.600
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Roll
the wheel, next country.

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:52.120
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: That's
great, yeah.

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:52.640
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN:
That's great.

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:53.870
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: So moving
next, we're going to South

00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:54.890
America, I believe.

00:08:54.890 --> 00:08:55.410
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN:
Wonderful.

00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:56.470
What is your name?

00:08:56.470 --> 00:08:58.740
JUAN IRUNGARAY: I'm Juan from
Buenos Aires, Argentina.

00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:00.620
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: And Juan,
tell us what you do.

00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:02.280
JUAN IRUNGARAY: Well,
I'm a GTUG manager.

00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:06.590
I've been working at the Buenos
Aires GTUG for almost

00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:07.230
two years now.

00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:09.950
And it's really been
a great ride.

00:09:09.950 --> 00:09:13.250
I mean, you get to know a lot
of interesting people.

00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:16.090
You get to learn a lot,
and assist to

00:09:16.090 --> 00:09:17.210
cool events like this.

00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:18.570
So it's been really great.

00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:19.940
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Now, I
noticed you're calling it a

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:21.280
GTUG instead of GDG.

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:22.970
Can you give us the
story behind that?

00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:23.440
JUAN IRUNGARAY: That's right.

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:27.080
So essentially the spirit
is the same.

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:30.170
We're just trying to appeal
to a broader audience.

00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:35.510
So we just want everyone to know
that if you are a Google

00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:36.890
technology user--

00:09:36.890 --> 00:09:40.080
I mean, if you ever did a Google
search, you have an

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:45.390
Android phone, if you use
Google+ for your social

00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:50.350
networking, there's people who
know about the topics.

00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:54.710
There are a lot of people who
like to get together and share

00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:56.290
what they know.

00:09:56.290 --> 00:10:01.280
And we like people from diverse

00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:03.753
backgrounds, from diverse--

00:10:03.753 --> 00:10:05.490
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: So you're
doing something much bigger

00:10:05.490 --> 00:10:07.970
than just developers, right?

00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:10.920
This is really the user
element of it, right?

00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:11.130
JUAN IRUNGARAY: Right.

00:10:11.130 --> 00:10:14.400
So we've been working with
educators, with journalists.

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:18.130
We basically try to get everyone
to know what Google

00:10:18.130 --> 00:10:22.410
tools are available and to make
the best use out of them.

00:10:22.410 --> 00:10:23.110
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN:
That's fantastic.

00:10:23.110 --> 00:10:23.810
I think we're--

00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:24.070
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: We'll--

00:10:24.070 --> 00:10:24.330
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Go ahead.

00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:25.640
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: We're just
about out of time here.

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:27.050
Maybe one more quick question.

00:10:27.050 --> 00:10:29.080
Quick piece of advice to anyone
out there who wants to

00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:31.710
start their own GDG or GTUG?

00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:33.130
JUAN IRUNGARAY: Just
look for us,

00:10:33.130 --> 00:10:36.070
developers.google.com/groups.

00:10:36.070 --> 00:10:37.910
There's a very active
community.

00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:42.610
So you can either find a group
near you, or we can help you

00:10:42.610 --> 00:10:43.630
start up a new group.

00:10:43.630 --> 00:10:48.180
So just send us an email, and
we'll surely give you a hand.

00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:48.670
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN:
Thank you.

00:10:48.670 --> 00:10:49.480
Thank you very much.

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:49.950
BRIAN FITZPATRICK:
I appreciate it.

00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:50.305
Excellent.

00:10:50.305 --> 00:10:50.660
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Yes.

00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:51.550
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: All right.

00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:52.000
Thanks a lot.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.540
We're going to turn it back
over to you guys.

00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:54.790
And back to the conference.

00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:55.360
See you in a bit.

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:56.610
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Bye-bye.
