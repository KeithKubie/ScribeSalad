00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:05.240
My final and perhaps most important piece of advice is to respect your audience.

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:07.920
Use color scales that everyone can see.

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:11.100
If you're looking at the circle on the screen, then you've likely noticed

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:16.280
the number 74 disguised as green dots among the many red dots.

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:21.430
If you can't see the 74, then you may be part of the approximately 10% of males

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:26.860
and 1% of females who suffer from a color deficiency known as colorblindness.

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:29.450
Red and green colorblindness is the most prevalent, but

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:30.960
there are other types too.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.850
Check out the Wikipedia article in the instructor notes to learn more

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:35.260
of the details.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.650
We've also included some colorblindness tests in the instructor notes and

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:40.400
a link to some recommended color palates.
