00:00:00.585 --> 00:00:02.502
Voiceover: So we've talked
about Benjamin Franklin

00:00:02.502 --> 00:00:05.169
as a public leader, we've talked about him

00:00:05.169 --> 00:00:07.118
as a businessman, we've
talked about him as

00:00:07.118 --> 00:00:10.385
an inventor and scientist, now I think the

00:00:10.385 --> 00:00:12.752
last piece of the Benjamin Franklin puzzle

00:00:12.752 --> 00:00:14.452
is just him as, for lack of a better word,

00:00:14.452 --> 00:00:15.718
him as founding father.

00:00:15.718 --> 00:00:18.185
Voiceover: Yes, and as a
diplomat in particular,

00:00:18.185 --> 00:00:20.702
'cause he was America's first diplomat.

00:00:20.702 --> 00:00:26.718
In about 1757, he becomes
the ambassador, or agent,

00:00:26.718 --> 00:00:31.286
of the Pennsylvania colony,
to represent Pennsylvania

00:00:31.286 --> 00:00:35.618
in London, with the
ministers, to try to make sure

00:00:35.618 --> 00:00:37.568
that the rights of the
assembly, and the people

00:00:37.568 --> 00:00:40.435
of Pennsylvania, were taken into account.

00:00:40.435 --> 00:00:43.119
And eventually, off and on over the next

00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:46.869
17 or 18 years, he
becomes an agent for a lot

00:00:46.869 --> 00:00:50.501
of the colonies, and starts
representing the interests

00:00:50.501 --> 00:00:52.551
of the American colonies in London.

00:00:52.551 --> 00:00:54.036
Voiceover: And this is
a really important time

00:00:54.036 --> 00:00:55.970
in American history, because this is when

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:59.536
tensions between the U.S.,
between the colonies,

00:00:59.536 --> 00:01:02.702
and Great Britain are
really coming to a head.

00:01:02.702 --> 00:01:04.703
You have the French and
Indian War really kind of

00:01:04.703 --> 00:01:08.135
part of a larger European
war, but that ends

00:01:08.135 --> 00:01:12.768
in 1763, the British want
the colonies to pay for it...

00:01:12.768 --> 00:01:15.443
Voiceover: Right, that's
the big deal, which is the

00:01:15.443 --> 00:01:18.292
British think that the American colonies

00:01:18.292 --> 00:01:21.536
have to pay because Britain helped protect

00:01:21.536 --> 00:01:23.401
them in the French and
Indian War, and they

00:01:23.401 --> 00:01:27.601
just start putting taxes
on the American colonies,

00:01:27.601 --> 00:01:30.502
and the American colonies
by this point are as

00:01:30.502 --> 00:01:34.301
sophisticated, and as strong
of an economy, as Britain.

00:01:34.301 --> 00:01:37.624
They don't feel that they
should be dictated to

00:01:37.624 --> 00:01:39.285
by the people in London.

00:01:39.285 --> 00:01:41.336
And they have their own
legislatures in each

00:01:41.336 --> 00:01:43.201
of the colonies, so they're saying, yeah,

00:01:43.201 --> 00:01:45.568
we know we have to have taxes, but our

00:01:45.568 --> 00:01:47.835
legislatures should do the taxes.

00:01:47.835 --> 00:01:50.601
We don't want taxation
without representation,

00:01:50.601 --> 00:01:54.717
as became the rallying
cry, and so it was up to

00:01:54.717 --> 00:01:58.085
Franklin to try to talk
the British Parliament

00:01:58.085 --> 00:02:00.369
out of things like the
Stamp Act, where every

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:02.119
time you bought a piece
of paper or newspaper

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:05.002
you had to pay a tax to
London, and to give the

00:02:05.002 --> 00:02:08.000
power to the colonial legislatures.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.202
Voiceover: So he was really,
you know when we read

00:02:09.202 --> 00:02:11.368
in the history books,
this whole time period

00:02:11.368 --> 00:02:15.067
of things coming, the
tensions rising, it was

00:02:15.067 --> 00:02:17.985
really Benjamin Franklin
that was trying to

00:02:17.985 --> 00:02:21.522
negotiate, communicate,
the anger, really...

00:02:21.522 --> 00:02:23.961
Voiceover: And he was
very close to a lot of the

00:02:23.961 --> 00:02:25.537
people in London then, it was part of the

00:02:25.537 --> 00:02:27.401
Enlightenment, there's a wonderful picture

00:02:27.401 --> 00:02:30.620
of him there in London, in
which there's Issac Newton

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.518
looking over his shoulder,
and so he is part of that

00:02:34.518 --> 00:02:37.718
intellectual class of like Doctor Johnson,

00:02:37.718 --> 00:02:40.885
and all the people in
London, but unfortunately

00:02:40.885 --> 00:02:43.702
the government is still
run by a very aristocratic

00:02:43.702 --> 00:02:48.734
Tory elite, and Franklin
has trouble convincing

00:02:48.734 --> 00:02:51.585
them to give rights to
the American colonies.

00:02:51.585 --> 00:02:53.036
Voiceover: And this breaking up, it does

00:02:53.036 --> 00:02:54.119
kind of pain him, because as you mention,

00:02:54.119 --> 00:02:55.201
this is the Enlightenment.

00:02:55.201 --> 00:02:57.336
Benjamin Franklin is a,
kind of a key figure,

00:02:57.336 --> 00:02:59.870
Voiceover: And he obtained electricity,

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:01.801
he was a great scientist, so this is this

00:03:01.801 --> 00:03:05.568
great man living in a
small house in London,

00:03:05.568 --> 00:03:09.036
right near the Parliament,
and he's very well

00:03:09.036 --> 00:03:11.286
respected by all the
intellectuals, but he gets

00:03:11.286 --> 00:03:14.536
treated very badly by the Parliament.

00:03:14.536 --> 00:03:16.587
At one point he's called
in front of what's called

00:03:16.587 --> 00:03:19.218
the Cockpit, which is
a part of Parliament,

00:03:19.218 --> 00:03:24.169
and he is humiliated,
because they make fun of him

00:03:24.169 --> 00:03:27.753
for trying to stop the
Parliament from taxing

00:03:27.753 --> 00:03:31.752
the colonies and that
enrages Benjamin Franklin,

00:03:31.752 --> 00:03:35.976
and that finally tips
him over to being closer

00:03:35.976 --> 00:03:38.836
to the side of, we may
have to have a revolution

00:03:38.836 --> 00:03:40.537
and just break away from England.

00:03:40.537 --> 00:03:41.835
Voiceover: And that actually leads to

00:03:41.835 --> 00:03:43.751
family problems, 'cause his son...

00:03:43.751 --> 00:03:45.535
Voiceover: Yeah, so he
brought his illegitimate son

00:03:45.535 --> 00:03:47.451
William over with him, and he's very close

00:03:47.451 --> 00:03:51.637
to William, but William
becomes quite aristocratic,

00:03:51.637 --> 00:03:53.952
despite the fact, or
maybe because of the fact

00:03:53.952 --> 00:03:56.801
that he was illegitimate
kid of a middle-class

00:03:56.801 --> 00:03:58.718
person, he starts hanging around with the

00:03:58.718 --> 00:04:01.203
dukes and the earls, and he ends up being

00:04:01.203 --> 00:04:03.736
appointed by the crown,
basically the government

00:04:03.736 --> 00:04:05.836
and the king, to be the royal governor of

00:04:05.836 --> 00:04:08.440
New Jersey, so William Franklin becomes a

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:12.318
dedicated loyalist, to
the crown of England, just

00:04:12.318 --> 00:04:16.086
as his father Benjamin
Franklin is becoming a rebel,

00:04:16.086 --> 00:04:18.986
and siding with those
who want a revolution.

00:04:18.986 --> 00:04:21.001
Voiceover: And so everything eventually,

00:04:21.001 --> 00:04:25.369
we know how history went, the 1775, 1776,

00:04:25.369 --> 00:04:29.752
hostilities begin, 1775
Franklin goes back.

00:04:29.752 --> 00:04:31.993
Voiceover: Franklin
goes back, he goes back

00:04:31.993 --> 00:04:34.092
unsuccessful because he had tried to stop

00:04:34.092 --> 00:04:35.285
the hostilities.

00:04:35.285 --> 00:04:38.252
He gets back to Philadelphia once again,

00:04:38.252 --> 00:04:40.287
at Market Street he comes off the boat,

00:04:40.287 --> 00:04:42.302
and everybody in Philadelphia is kind of

00:04:42.302 --> 00:04:45.786
wondering, is he loyal
to the British empire

00:04:45.786 --> 00:04:48.202
and the crown, or has he
truly joined the cause

00:04:48.202 --> 00:04:51.051
of revolution, and he has
a meeting with his son,

00:04:51.051 --> 00:04:52.886
who's then the royal
governor of New Jersey,

00:04:52.886 --> 00:04:54.502
and he tells his son he's gonna become

00:04:54.502 --> 00:04:56.619
a revolutionary, his
son says I'm gonna stay

00:04:56.619 --> 00:04:59.451
loyal to the crown, they
basically barely speak

00:04:59.451 --> 00:05:01.952
to each other again for
the rest of their lives,

00:05:01.952 --> 00:05:04.318
this is a great break,
and Franklin announces

00:05:04.318 --> 00:05:07.869
to the people in Philadelphia,
that he is going to join

00:05:07.869 --> 00:05:10.201
the cause of American independence.

00:05:10.201 --> 00:05:12.317
And that's when he gets to work with

00:05:12.317 --> 00:05:14.036
Jefferson and Adams on the

00:05:14.036 --> 00:05:19.169
Declaration of Independence
in July of 1776.

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:22.502
And right after that, in
order to make the Declaration

00:05:22.502 --> 00:05:25.085
a reality, they realize
we have to get France

00:05:25.085 --> 00:05:27.135
in on our side of the war.

00:05:27.135 --> 00:05:29.851
You mentioned that the
French and Indian War,

00:05:29.851 --> 00:05:31.551
that the British and the
French had been fighting

00:05:31.551 --> 00:05:36.135
for a century almost, off
and on, so in order for the

00:05:36.135 --> 00:05:38.717
U. S. to win its
independence in a war against

00:05:38.717 --> 00:05:41.702
Britain, it would help to
have the support of the

00:05:41.702 --> 00:05:44.735
French, who are naturally
willing to fight Britain,

00:05:44.735 --> 00:05:46.814
(chuckling) given any
opportunity, and were already

00:05:46.814 --> 00:05:50.294
part of a larger global war with Britain.

00:05:50.294 --> 00:05:53.651
So he becomes ambassador in Paris,

00:05:53.651 --> 00:05:55.519
in order to get the French in.

00:05:55.519 --> 00:05:57.385
Now if you look at
those two pictures, it's

00:05:57.385 --> 00:06:00.251
kind of cool, 'cause
there's Franklin in London,

00:06:00.251 --> 00:06:04.087
looking like quite a
gentleman in a velvet coat.

00:06:04.087 --> 00:06:06.962
When he gets to France, he
realizes that the French

00:06:06.962 --> 00:06:09.952
people have been reading
Jean Jacques Rousseau,

00:06:09.952 --> 00:06:12.619
maybe once too often,
about all the natural man

00:06:12.619 --> 00:06:16.400
and the forest, and how
the natural philosopher

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:17.735
comes from the back woods.

00:06:17.735 --> 00:06:19.635
Franklin never lived in
the back woods, (chuckling)

00:06:19.635 --> 00:06:21.619
he lived in Boston,
Philadelphia, and London

00:06:21.619 --> 00:06:23.484
his whole life, but when he gets to Paris,

00:06:23.484 --> 00:06:26.535
he wears a coonskin cap, and sort of a

00:06:26.535 --> 00:06:29.585
backwoodsman coat, so that he can appear

00:06:29.585 --> 00:06:32.961
to the French as sort of this wilderness

00:06:32.961 --> 00:06:36.169
natural man philosopher from the forest,

00:06:36.169 --> 00:06:38.785
talking about independence and liberty.

00:06:38.785 --> 00:06:41.756
Voiceover: And that's what
he did, I mean he does

00:06:41.756 --> 00:06:45.294
eventually return, but
he's in Paris, he does

00:06:45.294 --> 00:06:46.837
convince the French...

00:06:46.837 --> 00:06:49.361
Voiceover: to get in on our
side of the war Voiceover:
to get on our side of the war

00:06:49.361 --> 00:06:51.985
And he spends a significant amount of

00:06:51.985 --> 00:06:53.251
time there, and becomes...

00:06:53.251 --> 00:06:54.717
Voiceover: Oh, he becomes a grand old man

00:06:54.717 --> 00:06:56.447
in Paris, first of all as a diplomat

00:06:56.447 --> 00:06:58.135
convincing the French
to come in on our side

00:06:58.135 --> 00:06:59.785
of the war, as a publicist, he makes

00:06:59.785 --> 00:07:02.718
a printing press in his house near Paris,

00:07:02.718 --> 00:07:05.036
a place called Passy, and he prints the

00:07:05.036 --> 00:07:06.686
Declaration of Independence,
and all the great

00:07:06.686 --> 00:07:08.335
documents coming out of America.

00:07:08.335 --> 00:07:10.635
Of course he's renowned as a scientist,

00:07:10.635 --> 00:07:11.968
'cause the French had
been the first people

00:07:11.968 --> 00:07:14.286
to do his lightning rod experiments,

00:07:14.286 --> 00:07:17.787
so they love him in
France, and he's kind of,

00:07:17.787 --> 00:07:19.634
he has, you know, Deborah Read has died

00:07:19.634 --> 00:07:22.953
by this point, so even as he's in his 70s,

00:07:22.953 --> 00:07:25.885
he has two famous girlfriends, mistresses

00:07:25.885 --> 00:07:28.369
in Paris, and he writes wonderful poetry

00:07:28.369 --> 00:07:30.635
and bagatelles and stories to them.

00:07:30.635 --> 00:07:33.467
So he is a great bon vivant in Paris.

00:07:33.467 --> 00:07:34.535
Voiceover: So he's a bit of a Parisian.

00:07:34.535 --> 00:07:36.435
Voiceover: Very much of a Parisian,

00:07:36.435 --> 00:07:39.641
and drinks wonderful amounts of port.

00:07:39.641 --> 00:07:41.769
John Adams also has to come

00:07:41.769 --> 00:07:43.218
to Paris at a certain point.

00:07:43.218 --> 00:07:45.568
John Adams is very much the Puritan.

00:07:45.568 --> 00:07:47.435
And even though they
had worked together for

00:07:47.435 --> 00:07:49.684
many years, they didn't
really like each other.

00:07:49.684 --> 00:07:52.919
And John Adams was appalled at Franklin

00:07:52.919 --> 00:07:55.369
having two girlfriends,
and getting up late

00:07:55.369 --> 00:07:58.501
in the morning, and drinking a lot of port

00:07:58.501 --> 00:08:01.535
and brandy, but it is Franklin who is able

00:08:01.535 --> 00:08:03.786
to get the French in on our side, and then

00:08:03.786 --> 00:08:06.717
the triumph in Paris is
called the Treaty of Paris,

00:08:06.717 --> 00:08:11.611
when the war is winding
down, and Benjamin Franklin

00:08:11.611 --> 00:08:16.201
is able to negotiate
the treaty with Britain

00:08:16.201 --> 00:08:20.519
to end the American
Revolution and give the

00:08:20.519 --> 00:08:24.786
U. S. its independence,
and it ends the war,

00:08:24.786 --> 00:08:28.203
and Franklin is able to
do it working with the

00:08:28.203 --> 00:08:30.368
French, sometimes behind
the back of the French,

00:08:30.368 --> 00:08:33.169
a very wily diplomat,
and at that point they've

00:08:33.169 --> 00:08:35.051
kicked John Adams out because they know...

00:08:35.051 --> 00:08:35.751
Voiceover: They didn't like him.

00:08:35.751 --> 00:08:36.968
Voiceover: Ben Franklin's
the guy who can make

00:08:36.968 --> 00:08:39.085
this complicated piece happen.

00:08:39.085 --> 00:08:39.951
Voiceover: And they liked him more.

00:08:39.951 --> 00:08:41.893
Voiceover: Oh yeah,
(laughing) he was definitely,

00:08:41.893 --> 00:08:44.119
if you had to choose who are you gonna

00:08:44.119 --> 00:08:46.369
spend the evening with
in Paris, you'd pick

00:08:46.369 --> 00:08:48.352
Ben Franklin over John Adams, even though

00:08:48.352 --> 00:08:50.718
we have to give John
Adams [unintelligible]

00:08:50.718 --> 00:08:52.935
for being a very, very important patriot.

00:08:52.935 --> 00:08:54.836
Voiceover: And this is
the big picture, this is

00:08:54.836 --> 00:08:56.668
the one something that
was surprising to me,

00:08:56.668 --> 00:09:01.686
is that Benjamin Franklin,
who is one of our

00:09:01.686 --> 00:09:05.452
larger than life founding
fathers, his role

00:09:05.452 --> 00:09:07.452
was not to pick up a musket, his role was

00:09:07.452 --> 00:09:10.218
for the second half of his
life, he was in Europe,

00:09:10.218 --> 00:09:12.120
he was in London, he
was in Paris, and he was

00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:14.036
really there to represent
the country and to

00:09:14.036 --> 00:09:16.752
negotiate with both England, as kind of an

00:09:16.752 --> 00:09:19.485
adversary, or eventually an adversary,

00:09:19.485 --> 00:09:21.919
and with Paris, as an ally.

00:09:21.919 --> 00:09:23.369
Voiceover: And we would
not really have won

00:09:23.369 --> 00:09:25.503
the Revolution without his diplomacy,

00:09:25.503 --> 00:09:27.726
because it's the French who send most of

00:09:27.726 --> 00:09:30.169
the gunpowder we used,
most of the troops used,

00:09:30.169 --> 00:09:32.702
it's Vergennes, the French
foreign minister who helps

00:09:32.702 --> 00:09:37.085
send a navy, so that at Yorktown, when

00:09:37.085 --> 00:09:39.169
George Washington wins the battle, that

00:09:39.169 --> 00:09:40.651
pretty much ends the Revolution because

00:09:40.651 --> 00:09:42.336
the French navy is there supporting him.

00:09:42.336 --> 00:09:46.629
So all of these things work,
and finally, near the end,

00:09:46.629 --> 00:09:50.622
in 1885, I think, as he's just about to

00:09:50.622 --> 00:09:53.669
turn 80, he comes back
for the last few years

00:09:53.669 --> 00:09:55.902
of his life, gets involved in the

00:09:55.902 --> 00:09:58.336
Constitutional Convention, and

00:09:58.336 --> 00:10:00.356
becomes a great elder statesman.

00:10:00.356 --> 00:10:01.954
Voiceover: Fascinating.
