00:00:08.317 --> 00:00:21.446
(somber piano music)

00:00:21.446 --> 00:00:24.431
Voiceover: In the 1950s, Mark
Rothko explored how forms

00:00:24.431 --> 00:00:28.266
could float in space,
sometimes advancing toward you,

00:00:28.266 --> 00:00:31.514
other times quietly
receding away from you.

00:00:31.514 --> 00:00:32.475
Now by looking at his paintings,

00:00:32.475 --> 00:00:34.694
there's a number of ways
that we could discern

00:00:34.694 --> 00:00:36.958
how these effects are achieved.

00:00:36.958 --> 00:00:39.495
However, Rothko was notoriously hermetic

00:00:39.495 --> 00:00:41.303
about his studio practices.

00:00:41.303 --> 00:00:44.140
We don't know all that
much about what materials

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.542
he used and how exactly he did it,

00:00:46.542 --> 00:00:49.074
but by looking closely,
we can learn a lot.

00:00:49.074 --> 00:00:51.748
Now how these forms
are liberated in space,

00:00:51.748 --> 00:00:55.201
how they even have this
ability to move via color

00:00:55.201 --> 00:00:57.481
is also about the way Rothko handles

00:00:57.481 --> 00:01:01.364
the edges of these
floating cloud-like forms.

00:01:01.364 --> 00:01:05.701
Rothko layered zone over
zone over zone of paint.

00:01:05.701 --> 00:01:09.057
Here we can a very bright
blue, almost totally

00:01:09.057 --> 00:01:12.060
overpainted by a dark burgundy.

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.894
It appears that Rothko
often flared out paint,

00:01:14.894 --> 00:01:17.812
one layer over another and
as we look at the edges,

00:01:17.812 --> 00:01:20.611
we realize that there's
kind of a buzzing sensation

00:01:20.611 --> 00:01:23.213
as these two colors
compete for our attention

00:01:23.213 --> 00:01:25.895
and almost vibrate against one another.

00:01:25.895 --> 00:01:28.019
To further allow these forms to float off

00:01:28.019 --> 00:01:29.772
and away from the surface of the canvas,

00:01:29.772 --> 00:01:32.810
Rothko often softened the
corners of these forms

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.184
and here we see something
called a "turpentine burn",

00:01:35.184 --> 00:01:38.462
where the artist likely
took some solvent on the rag

00:01:38.462 --> 00:01:40.559
and scrubbed back into
the surface of the canvas,

00:01:40.559 --> 00:01:43.560
blending all of those
colors together meanwhile

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.215
erasing a hard corner,
which would visually

00:01:46.215 --> 00:01:49.400
locate that form in space.

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.559
In addition to leaving
hints of these colors

00:01:51.559 --> 00:01:53.725
around the edges of forms,

00:01:53.725 --> 00:01:56.447
crucially, Rothko allows
you to see through

00:01:56.447 --> 00:02:02.185
veils of paint because
he painted so thinly.

00:02:02.185 --> 00:02:06.144
Now let me show you exactly
how Rothko painted so thinly.

00:02:06.144 --> 00:02:08.584
Rothko would add so much
turpentine to his paint,

00:02:08.584 --> 00:02:10.842
that he would stain the canvas,

00:02:10.842 --> 00:02:12.792
less painting on the canvas, but really

00:02:12.792 --> 00:02:16.033
pushing his paint into it as a stain.

00:02:16.033 --> 00:02:17.502
Because these stains are so thin,

00:02:17.502 --> 00:02:21.206
you're able to read one color
quite literally through another.

00:02:21.206 --> 00:02:24.108
In thicker areas of paint,
you see the over layer.

00:02:24.108 --> 00:02:26.276
In thinner areas of that over layer,

00:02:26.276 --> 00:02:28.118
you begin to see the under layer.

00:02:28.118 --> 00:02:31.349
And because Rothko layered
color over color over color,

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:35.489
any given zone is infinitely complex.

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:38.187
Rothko thought that if the
viewer properly experienced

00:02:38.187 --> 00:02:42.525
his paintings, that he or
she would very often cry.

00:02:42.525 --> 00:02:44.224
We're quite literally
talking about a painter

00:02:44.224 --> 00:02:46.765
who wanted his viewers to experience

00:02:46.765 --> 00:02:50.476
the kind of emotions that
he very likely did himself.

00:02:50.476 --> 00:02:53.104
It's not uncommon for people
to be emotionally moved,

00:02:53.104 --> 00:02:55.440
perhaps even to cry
when listening to music.

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.965
However, it's very rare that visual art

00:02:57.965 --> 00:03:00.142
can evoke those same emotions.

00:03:00.142 --> 00:03:03.642
Rothko, if you will, is competing
on the territory of music,

00:03:03.642 --> 00:03:09.184
trying to evoke very, very
strong emotions through paint.

00:03:09.184 --> 00:03:10.941
The experience of viewing his painting

00:03:10.941 --> 00:03:12.421
is a very somber one.

00:03:12.421 --> 00:03:13.595
It lacks resolution.

00:03:13.595 --> 00:03:15.359
Although it's very quiet,
although it's a quite

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:17.577
beautiful painting, it's a painting that

00:03:17.577 --> 00:03:19.930
never has a finality to it.

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.032
It's one that almost unravels in time.
