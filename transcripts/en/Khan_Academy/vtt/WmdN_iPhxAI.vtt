00:00:01.354 --> 00:00:03.746
- [Voiceover] So we've been
talking about curvature.

00:00:03.746 --> 00:00:06.834
And this means you've got
some sort of parametric curve,

00:00:06.834 --> 00:00:08.390
you might think as parameterized by

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:11.178
a vector valued function S of t.

00:00:11.178 --> 00:00:12.502
And curvature is supposed to measure

00:00:12.502 --> 00:00:14.740
just how much this curve actually curves.

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:17.620
So here it's curving quite a
bit, curvature should be high.

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:18.988
But here it's, you know. relatively

00:00:18.988 --> 00:00:21.264
straight so curvature should be low.

00:00:21.264 --> 00:00:23.284
And I brought up in the last video

00:00:23.284 --> 00:00:25.212
this pretty complicated formula.

00:00:25.212 --> 00:00:27.731
And to remind you of the circumstances,

00:00:27.731 --> 00:00:31.075
I was saying that curvature,
denoted with this little kappa,

00:00:31.075 --> 00:00:32.907
is typically calculated as the

00:00:32.907 --> 00:00:35.975
derivative of the unit
tangent vector function.

00:00:35.975 --> 00:00:38.527
So we'll think of some kind of function

00:00:38.527 --> 00:00:41.755
that gives unit tangent
vectors at every single point.

00:00:41.755 --> 00:00:43.335
So you know, just a vector with

00:00:43.335 --> 00:00:46.563
a length of one lying
tangent to the curve.

00:00:46.563 --> 00:00:47.535
And that's going to be some kind

00:00:47.535 --> 00:00:49.303
of function of the same parameter.

00:00:49.303 --> 00:00:51.879
So big T for unit tangent
vector, little t for the

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:55.315
parameter, hopefully
that's not too confusing.

00:00:55.315 --> 00:00:57.915
Then we're taking the derivative
of this, not with respect

00:00:57.915 --> 00:01:01.979
to t, the parameter, but with
respect to arc length, s.

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:04.347
And by arc length, I mean
if you take a tiny step

00:01:04.347 --> 00:01:08.271
along the curve, and consider
this to be of size ds,

00:01:08.271 --> 00:01:11.103
so s typically denotes
length along a curve,

00:01:11.103 --> 00:01:12.915
this will be a tiny change in length.

00:01:12.915 --> 00:01:16.607
You're wondering how much that
unit tangent vector changes.

00:01:16.607 --> 00:01:18.303
And specifically what I mean by that,

00:01:18.303 --> 00:01:20.439
if you kind of imagine
tangent vectors off sitting in

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:23.295
their own space somewhere,
where each one of them has unit

00:01:23.295 --> 00:01:26.939
lengths so they're all just
kind of of the same length

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.373
and lets say they're all
stemming from the same points.

00:01:28.373 --> 00:01:30.319
So rather than drawing them
stemming from the curve,

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:31.619
to show that they're tangent, I just

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.223
want to show them in their own space.

00:01:33.223 --> 00:01:36.567
The derivative, the change in
that tangent vector, would be

00:01:36.567 --> 00:01:40.303
some, some other vector that
tells you how you move from one

00:01:40.303 --> 00:01:42.907
to the other, kind of tells
you how much it's turning.

00:01:42.907 --> 00:01:46.295
So the curvature itself is
given not by that vector,

00:01:46.295 --> 00:01:48.271
because this would be a vector quantity,

00:01:48.271 --> 00:01:51.055
but by the absolute value of it.

00:01:51.055 --> 00:01:54.003
And I said in the last
video that it turns out

00:01:54.003 --> 00:01:56.607
that this quantity, when you
work it out for a vector-value

00:01:56.607 --> 00:02:00.107
function with components, with componenets

00:02:01.386 --> 00:02:03.803
x of t, x of t and y of t,

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.918
that it happens to equal
this complicated formula.

00:02:10.918 --> 00:02:13.150
And what I'm gonna do here,
I going to break it down

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.933
and show why this formula
isn't actually all that random.

00:02:16.933 --> 00:02:19.278
It's actually kind of
sensible as a description

00:02:19.278 --> 00:02:22.437
for how much the curve
really curves at a point.

00:02:22.437 --> 00:02:24.941
So lets start by looking
at the numerator here.

00:02:24.941 --> 00:02:28.033
This x-prime of t, first
derivative of the first component,

00:02:28.033 --> 00:02:31.025
times the second derivative of
the second component, minus,

00:02:31.025 --> 00:02:32.073
and then kind of symmetrically,

00:02:32.073 --> 00:02:35.345
y-prime times x double-prime.

00:02:35.345 --> 00:02:36.462
You might be able to recognize

00:02:36.462 --> 00:02:38.918
this as a certain cross product.

00:02:38.918 --> 00:02:42.692
So the cross product, if
we take x-prime, y-prime,

00:02:42.692 --> 00:02:46.609
and these are still
functions of t, as a vector

00:02:47.916 --> 00:02:50.980
crossed with the vector
containing the double primes.

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.500
And if you aren't familiar
with the cross products

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:53.844
or you're feeling a little shaky

00:02:53.844 --> 00:02:55.028
and you kind of want to review,

00:02:55.028 --> 00:02:56.680
now would be a good time pause the video,

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.536
take a look at the cross product videos,

00:02:58.536 --> 00:03:00.232
and remind yourself both of how

00:03:00.232 --> 00:03:03.364
to compute it and what the
underlying intuition is.

00:03:03.364 --> 00:03:06.572
Because the way that we compute
a cross product like this is

00:03:06.572 --> 00:03:09.520
you take the components in the
diagonal here, you know that

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.576
rightward diagonal, and
multiply them together.

00:03:12.576 --> 00:03:16.056
That's where you get your
x-prime, y double-prime.

00:03:16.056 --> 00:03:18.704
And then you subtract off
the components in the other

00:03:18.704 --> 00:03:22.232
diagonal, you know it kind
of feels like a determinant.

00:03:22.232 --> 00:03:24.732
X double-prime, times y-prime.

00:03:25.856 --> 00:03:28.132
But the way that you
interpret this vector,

00:03:28.132 --> 00:03:30.060
well I'll get to the
interpretation in just a moment.

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.356
First, first let me kind of write out

00:03:32.356 --> 00:03:34.588
what this is in terms of our function S.

00:03:34.588 --> 00:03:38.068
This first vector is just
the first derivative of S,

00:03:38.068 --> 00:03:41.692
so that's S-prime of t,
the first derivative of S.

00:03:41.692 --> 00:03:43.364
And we're crossing that with this one,

00:03:43.364 --> 00:03:46.428
which is the second derivative,
vector value derivative,

00:03:46.428 --> 00:03:49.011
but the second derivative of S.

00:03:50.748 --> 00:03:54.116
So before we, before we
do anything else lets just

00:03:54.116 --> 00:03:57.132
start to think about, what do
both of these vectors mean?

00:03:57.132 --> 00:04:00.499
How do you interpret the
S-prime and the S double-prime?

00:04:00.499 --> 00:04:02.379
I'm going to go ahead and give

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:04.123
ourselves a little bit of room here.

00:04:04.123 --> 00:04:05.771
So I'll draw the curve again.

00:04:05.771 --> 00:04:09.159
We're on our x, y plane, and
you have some kind of curve.

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:12.667
The function S itself is giving vectors

00:04:12.667 --> 00:04:16.403
whose tips trace out this curve, right?

00:04:16.403 --> 00:04:20.467
As T changes, the tips of these
vectors trace out the curve.

00:04:20.467 --> 00:04:22.999
And now the first derivative,
that first derivative

00:04:22.999 --> 00:04:26.332
vector, S-prime of t, is telling you

00:04:26.332 --> 00:04:29.512
how that tip should move
to go along the curve.

00:04:29.512 --> 00:04:33.088
As you go from one S
vector to another S vector,

00:04:33.088 --> 00:04:35.340
what direction should that tip move.

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.380
And what this means is
that at every given point,

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.076
when you kind of do this
in a limiting fashion

00:04:40.076 --> 00:04:43.560
and you only look at infinitesimal
changes in the original

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:47.344
vector, you always get some
kind of tangent vector, right?

00:04:47.344 --> 00:04:50.062
So all of these are tangent
vectors, not necessarily unit,

00:04:50.062 --> 00:04:53.188
you might have like a very
long tangent vector to indicate

00:04:53.188 --> 00:04:56.808
that you're traveling very
quickly across that space.

00:04:56.808 --> 00:04:58.487
And now, how would you think about

00:04:58.487 --> 00:05:02.810
the second derivative vector
here, S double-prime of t?

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:04.994
Well the way to do
that, I like to think of

00:05:04.994 --> 00:05:06.714
all of the tangents
vectors then just kind of

00:05:06.714 --> 00:05:08.966
living in their own space, right?

00:05:08.966 --> 00:05:12.982
If this here is representing
S of t, I just want to

00:05:12.982 --> 00:05:17.149
look in isolation at what
S-prime of t looks like.

00:05:18.231 --> 00:05:19.725
So each one of those
vectors, you know maybe this

00:05:19.725 --> 00:05:22.465
first one is just is
very long, gargantuan,

00:05:22.465 --> 00:05:24.345
indicating you're going very quickly.

00:05:24.345 --> 00:05:27.109
And then after that you've
got something else here,

00:05:27.109 --> 00:05:28.665
maybe it's pointing a little bit down.

00:05:28.665 --> 00:05:29.685
And you're kind of thinking about how

00:05:29.685 --> 00:05:31.357
all of these derivative vectors change,

00:05:31.357 --> 00:05:33.701
but I want them all
rooted at the same point.

00:05:33.701 --> 00:05:36.141
Just see what happens when
they're all rooted at the origin,

00:05:36.141 --> 00:05:38.809
because that, that gives
us a way to think about

00:05:38.809 --> 00:05:40.993
what changing the vector should look like.

00:05:40.993 --> 00:05:42.597
So in particular, as you're moving from

00:05:42.597 --> 00:05:45.453
this vector to this one, the tip should be

00:05:45.453 --> 00:05:47.541
kind of moving in this direction, right?

00:05:47.541 --> 00:05:49.677
So this second derivative
value is going to

00:05:49.677 --> 00:05:52.533
tell us how the tip of the
first derivative should move.

00:05:52.533 --> 00:05:54.065
And then similarly over here it tells us

00:05:54.065 --> 00:05:56.041
how the tip of that should move.

00:05:56.041 --> 00:05:59.081
And just as an example and
kind of a hint as to why this

00:05:59.081 --> 00:06:01.573
has something to do with curvature,

00:06:01.573 --> 00:06:05.667
if you have a curve
that turns very sharply,

00:06:05.667 --> 00:06:09.158
turns very sharply, you would
have you know a tangent vector

00:06:09.158 --> 00:06:11.328
that starts by pointing up
and to the right and then very

00:06:11.328 --> 00:06:14.740
quickly is pointing down,
down and to the right.

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:16.808
So if they were off, you know
we'd kind of draw them on

00:06:16.808 --> 00:06:19.500
their own, rooted in their own location,

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:22.472
you can maybe see how the
second derivative vector

00:06:22.472 --> 00:06:25.376
is telling it to turn
somehow in that direction.

00:06:25.376 --> 00:06:28.092
And if you, you know
capture not just those two

00:06:28.092 --> 00:06:30.996
but infinitesimally what's
going on as you move from

00:06:30.996 --> 00:06:32.836
one to the next you're gonna get

00:06:32.836 --> 00:06:36.577
this kind of turning motion
for all of these guys.

00:06:36.577 --> 00:06:38.713
So the second derivative
vector would be pulling

00:06:38.713 --> 00:06:41.081
perpendicular, perpendicular to that

00:06:41.081 --> 00:06:44.261
first derivative vector as
a way of telling it to turn.

00:06:44.261 --> 00:06:46.281
So just to draw that on
its own, if you have a

00:06:46.281 --> 00:06:48.694
first derivative vector, and
then the second derivative

00:06:48.694 --> 00:06:50.646
vector is perpendicular to it,

00:06:50.646 --> 00:06:53.686
it's telling it how it
should turn in some way.

00:06:53.686 --> 00:06:55.682
But if it was, you know
lets say it was not purely

00:06:55.682 --> 00:06:57.934
perpendicular but it was
also pointing against,

00:06:57.934 --> 00:06:59.514
it would be telling that, that vector,

00:06:59.514 --> 00:07:02.370
that first derivative vector,
to shrink in some way.

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:03.554
So that would be an indication that

00:07:03.554 --> 00:07:05.898
not only is it turning
but it's getting smaller,

00:07:05.898 --> 00:07:09.686
meaning the trajectory based
on S is probably slowing down.

00:07:09.686 --> 00:07:13.998
And if it was kind of turning
it but also pointing away,

00:07:13.998 --> 00:07:15.037
that would mean it's telling the

00:07:15.037 --> 00:07:16.917
first derivative vector to grow.

00:07:16.917 --> 00:07:19.845
So not only should you
be turning on your curve

00:07:19.845 --> 00:07:21.633
but you should also be speeding up.

00:07:21.633 --> 00:07:23.810
But the case we care about
most is we're just trying to

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:27.060
measure how perpendicular it is, right?

00:07:28.295 --> 00:07:30.978
And this is where the
cross product comes in,

00:07:30.978 --> 00:07:32.173
because if you think
about how you interpret

00:07:32.173 --> 00:07:36.609
that cross product, how you
interpret the cross product,

00:07:36.609 --> 00:07:38.825
it's basically the area
if you kind of take these

00:07:38.825 --> 00:07:42.285
two vectors, tip-to-tail as
they are, and think about

00:07:42.285 --> 00:07:45.069
the parallelogram that they trace out.

00:07:45.069 --> 00:07:46.813
Lets see, so this blue dotted line

00:07:46.813 --> 00:07:49.261
should be parallel to the blue vector.

00:07:49.261 --> 00:07:52.521
The area of this, of this
traced out parallelogram

00:07:52.521 --> 00:07:55.121
for each of them, that's what tells you

00:07:55.121 --> 00:07:57.745
that's how you interpret
the cross product.

00:07:57.745 --> 00:08:02.273
The cross product between
S-prime and S double-prime.

00:08:02.273 --> 00:08:05.085
So this cross product, by giving
you that area, is kind of a

00:08:05.085 --> 00:08:08.405
measure of just how perpendicular
these vectors are, right?

00:08:08.405 --> 00:08:11.701
Because if one of them,
if they point very much in

00:08:11.701 --> 00:08:13.793
the same direction, right,
and they're only slightly

00:08:13.793 --> 00:08:17.089
perpendicular, that means that
the parallelogram they trace,

00:08:17.089 --> 00:08:20.341
they trace out is gonna
have a very small area.

00:08:20.341 --> 00:08:22.941
It's gonna be a smaller
area in comparison.

00:08:22.941 --> 00:08:27.005
So with that, I don't want
this video to run too long,

00:08:27.005 --> 00:08:29.001
so I'm gonna call it in
here, but then I'll just

00:08:29.001 --> 00:08:30.905
continue on in the next
one through the same

00:08:30.905 --> 00:08:33.459
line of reasoning to build
to our original formula.
