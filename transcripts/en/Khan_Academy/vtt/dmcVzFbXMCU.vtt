00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:03.860
In a recent gum-chewing
contest, Violet

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:08.621
tried to blow the biggest
blueberry-flavored bubble ever.

00:00:08.621 --> 00:00:12.320
Every 3 seconds, she
added 1 piece of gum

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.540
to her huge bubble.

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:18.350
On the graph below, the x-axis
represents time in seconds.

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:20.800
So this right over
here is our x-axis.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.080
And the y-axis represents pieces
of gum in Violet's bubble.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.640
So this is the y-axis
right over here.

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.060
Plot points to show
how many pieces of gum

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.830
were in Violet's bubble
after 3, 6, and 9 seconds.

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:36.070
So every 3 seconds, she
adds one piece of gum.

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.530
So let me throw
all of my-- so what

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:45.210
we care is about 3 seconds,
6 seconds, and 9 seconds.

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.270
So every 3 seconds, we know
that she adds one piece of gum.

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:50.880
This is 0 right over here.

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.930
We're not going to worry
about negative time.

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:57.770
So after 3 seconds, she would
have added one piece of gum

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:59.550
to her bubble.

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.300
Now, if 3 more seconds pass by,
she would have added 1 more,

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.770
and now she would have 2
pieces of gum in her bubble.

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.160
And then if 3 more seconds pass
by, now we're at 9 seconds,

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:11.970
she would have added
1 more piece of gum,

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.340
and now we're at 3
total pieces of gum.

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.320
And notice, the ratio
between the pieces of gum

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.500
and the time that has
passed has stayed constant,

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.340
because she's doing
it at a constant rate.

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.350
1 to 3 is the same
ratio as 2 to 6,

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.410
which is the same
ratio as 3 to 9.

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:31.840
So, let's check our answer.

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.700
Very good.
