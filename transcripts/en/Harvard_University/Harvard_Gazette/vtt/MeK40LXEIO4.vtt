00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.960
This is what's known as the Feejee mermaid.

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:33.560
What we know from museum documentation

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:38.620
is that Moses Kimball had in his
possession a mermaid that he obtained

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:44.440
from a Boston sea captain. The Boston sea
captain, according to the story, had

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:50.140
purchased it from some Japanese sailors
who said that it was an actual mermaid.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:58.860
The Boston sea captain brings the mermaid
back to Boston, dies penniless, gives it

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:05.460
to his son who then sells it to Kimble.
Kimble then contacts his friend PT

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:12.720
Barnum and Barnum then loans the mermaid
from Kimball to put it on display as an

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:13.980
actual mermaid.

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.960
It's not an actual
mermaid, that much is clear.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.759
We know that it's put together from
various bits and pieces; it's part fish, most

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:30.880
likely carp, there's some bone in there,
possibly monkey bone, but we know that a

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:36.130
lot of it is paper mache. There's an
armature inside, so it's a bit of

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.740
everything put together to make what you
see here.

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.240
We have this particular object

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.890
on display at "All the World is Here"
because it speaks to early museums'

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.720
early collecting practices, which were a
combination of scientific natural

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.620
history and the spectacle. And this
clearly is a spectacle.
