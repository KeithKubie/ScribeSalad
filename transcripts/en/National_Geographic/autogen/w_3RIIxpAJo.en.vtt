she's right there in front of him he has
an intuitive emotional response that

an intuitive emotional response that
 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:10.080
an intuitive emotional response that
tells him to help her and stops him from

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090
tells him to help her and stops him from
 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.040
