00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.235
We're on problem 210.

00:00:03.235 --> 00:00:07.290
A television manufacturer
produces 600 units of a

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:15.140
certain model each month at a
cost to the manufacturer of

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:20.730
$90 per unit.

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.960
And all of the produced units
are sold each month.

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.490
What is the minimum selling
price per unit that will

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:31.010
ensure that the monthly profit--
revenue from sales

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:33.750
minus manufacturer's cost to
produce-- on the sales of

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.460
these units will be
at least $42,000.

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:40.310
OK.

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:43.260
So, they want to know the
minimum selling price.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.200
So, let's call that p.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.190
So how much are they going
to make per unit?

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.900
p minus whatever
their cost was.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.280
p minus $90.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.600
That's how much they
make per unit.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.490
And they do that
for 600 units.

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:03.460
And they say that this has
to be at least $42,000.

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:08.820
So, this has to be greater
than or equal to 42,000.

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:09.170
OK.

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:15.050
So we get 600p minus--
what's 9 times 6?

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:18.580
It's 54.

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.400
And then we have one,
two, three 0's.

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.760
54,000-- Right?

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:23.930
9 times 6.

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:24.940
Yep.

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.540
--is greater than or
equal to 42,000.

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:31.285
So then you get 600p.

00:01:31.285 --> 00:01:33.760
Let's add 54,000
to both sides.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:42.390
Has to be greater than or equal
to 54 plus 42 is 96,000.

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.520
And just to simplify things,
let's divide

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.890
both sides by 100.

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.670
So, you get 6p.

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.310
If you get two 0's here,
two 0's here.

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:56.190
6p has to be greater than 960.

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:58.630
And then p has to be greater
than or equal to-- we don't

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:59.560
have to worry about
this because

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.510
it's a positive number.

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:08.180
6 goes into 96, 16 times, so it
goes into 960, 160 times.

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:15.460
So the minimum selling price
is $160 which is choice d.

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:19.430
Problem 211.

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:31.980
If 4x plus 3y is equal to minus
2, and 3x plus 6 is

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.850
equal to 0, what is
the value of y?

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:35.690
Well this is a quick one.

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.190
3x would be equal to minus 6.

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.450
So x is equal to minus 2.

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:42.550
Substitute back here.

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:48.350
4 times minus 2, minus 8 plus
3y is equal to minus 2.

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:50.080
Add 8 to both sides.

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.170
3y is equal to minus 2 plus 8.

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.250
Or 3y is equal to 6.

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.100
y is equal to 2.

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.025
And so that is choice e.

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.090
Problem 212.

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.560
I'll do it in a different
color.

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.060
212.

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.560
The data sets one, two, and
three above are ordered from

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.690
greatest standard deviation to
least standard deviation in

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:19.840
which of the following?

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:20.280
OK.

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.740
So they want us to order
them essentially.

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:34.540
Greatest-- So, set one was
72, 73, 74, 75, 76.

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:44.660
Set two is 74-- it says 74 a
bunch of times-- 74, 74.

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:55.580
And then set three has 62, and
then 74, 74, 74, and then 89.

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:58.400
So, standard deviation is how
much, on average, do the

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.040
numbers vary from the mean.

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.210
And all of these cases,
the mean is 74.

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:07.290
I'm just eyeballing it.

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.610
Let's see 89 is 15 more.

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:13.120
Actually here the
mean isn't 74.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.040
So, first of all, every number
here is the mean.

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:17.870
So, the standard deviation
is actually 0.

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:20.839
So this is going to be-- they
want to know from greatest

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:23.660
standard deviation to least
standard deviation.

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:26.980
So, 2 is definitely the least
standard deviation.

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:30.390
So that leaves us with choices
either b or d.

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:35.860
And now have to figure out which
of these have a lower

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:37.750
standard deviation.

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:41.080
So here we can just eyeball
and say the average is 74.

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.710
If you average this and this
you get 74, that and

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:44.110
that you get 74.

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:46.500
So, what's the difference
from 74?

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:47.730
Here it's 2.

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:48.760
Here it's 1.

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:50.170
Here it's 0.

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:52.450
Here it's 1.

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:53.710
Here it's 2.

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:55.570
You just want the magnitude,
how far away you are

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:57.410
from 74 each time.

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:59.740
And if you were to average these
numbers, you get 2 plus

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:01.230
1, plus 1 plus 2.

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:03.970
That's 6 divided by 5.

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:06.160
So, you get 6 over 5.

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.260
You know they square-- you could
even do the variance if

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.000
you really cared about it, you
could square these numbers.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.270
But you just want to get some
measure of, on average, how

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:14.000
far is each of the numbers
from the mean.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.970
So here's 6 over 5.

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:17.700
Let's see 2 plus 1, 3.

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:17.950
Yep.

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:19.240
6-- and there's five numbers.

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:22.450
And 6 over 5 is the standard
deviation there.

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:23.410
What's the mean here?

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:25.390
This is interesting.

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:27.930
So, 74 to 89.

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:28.880
Do I have those numbers right?

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:29.070
Yeah.

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:32.280
to go from 74 to 89 you
have to go plus-- let

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:33.530
me add these up.

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:44.100
You get 62-- actually what's
the average of 62 and 89?

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:47.836
No, it's not 74.

00:05:47.836 --> 00:05:56.820
Let's see 2 plus 11 is-- well
I could just take the

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:58.170
average-- I just want
to figure out the

00:05:58.170 --> 00:05:59.470
mean as fast as possible.

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:02.630
So 89 and 62.

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:05.620
9 plus 2 is 11.

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:07.890
9 plus 6-- 151.

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:10.400
You divide that by 2.

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:16.110
The mean of these two
numbers are 75.5.

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:19.090
So, at least if you're trying to
figure out the mean, that's

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:23.330
going to be the same thing is
the mean of-- so actually

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:24.110
let's just do this.

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:25.530
It's 151.

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:27.110
Let's just take the average
of everything.

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:30.990
I tried to be cute, but it's
better to just be brute force.

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:38.560
So, 62 plus 89 is 151, plus
74 times 3, divided by 5.

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:38.840
Let's see.

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:44.690
74 times 3.

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:46.050
4 times 3 is 12.

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:47.430
7 times 3 is 21.

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:48.700
22.

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:54.470
And then 222 plus 151 is 373.

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:56.880
And then we're going to
divide that by 5.

00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:07.250
So, 5 goes into 373-- 7 times 5
is 35, 23, 5 goes into 23 4

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:09.870
times, 4 times 5 is 20.

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:11.100
3.

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:13.790
74.6.

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:16.340
So the mean here is 74.6.

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:18.040
This is going to have the
largest standard deviation

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:21.570
because this is 0.6 from the
means, this is 0.6 from the

00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:23.890
mean, this is 0.6
from the mean.

00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:28.920
This number is 12.6
from the mean.

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:33.590
And then this number is
14.4 from the mean.

00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:37.590
So, if you're to average these
numbers, you're going to get a

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:41.030
bigger number than 6/5, but
let's just confirm it.

00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:46.090
So, 12.6 plus 14.4-- oh yeah,
you're definitely going to get

00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:48.550
a much bigger number because
when you summed all these up,

00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:49.350
you got a 6.

00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:55.060
When you just sum up the 12 and
the 14.4 you get-- 15--

00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:56.070
you get 27.

00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:57.740
And then it's going
to get to 29.

00:07:57.740 --> 00:07:59.510
You divide that by 5.

00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:00.970
The standard deviation here
is going to be 4.

00:08:00.970 --> 00:08:03.970
So, 3 has the largest
standard deviation.

00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:08.220
2 has the least. So, the
correct answer is d.

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:09.510
I should've been able
to eyeball that.

00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:11.660
I shouldn't have had to go
through all that computation.

00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:12.650
I took too much time.

00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:14.120
That wouldn't have been
acceptable on the GMAT.

00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:21.150
Problem 213.

00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:24.890
Which of the following is the
lowest positive integer that

00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:27.890
is the divisible by all
of those numbers?

00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:33.190
So, it's 2, 3, 4,
5, 6, 7, 8, 8.

00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:34.980
So the lowest positive
integer that is

00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:37.299
divisible by all of those.

00:08:37.299 --> 00:08:41.120
So, one way to think about it is
let's just try to minimize

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:43.020
our multiplication.

00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:48.140
If we're divisible bye 8,
then we don't have to

00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:51.160
worry about 2 and 4.

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:54.730
Being divisible by
8 is enough.

00:08:54.730 --> 00:08:57.670
Likewise if we're divisible by
9, we don't have to worry

00:08:57.670 --> 00:08:59.726
about being divisible by 3
because we're definitely going

00:08:59.726 --> 00:09:01.810
to be divisible by 3.

00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:04.340
We need to be divisible by 7.

00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:08.700
If we're divisible by 6-- well,
if we're divisible by 8

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:12.880
and 9 then that means we're
already divisible by 2 and 3.

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:16.400
And if we're divisible by 2 and
3 then we don't have to

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:18.760
worry about 6.

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:20.930
So, we only have to worry
about 5, 7, 8, and 9.

00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:23.350
So what are those numbers when
you multiply by each other?

00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:27.900
So if we do 8 times 9 is 72.

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:35.240
8 times 9 is equal to 72, we got
rid of those, times 7 is

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:38.270
equal to 2 times 7 is 14.

00:09:38.270 --> 00:09:41.320
7 times 7 is 49, plus 1 is 50.

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:42.570
And that times 5.

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:47.040
4 times 5 is 20.

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:48.450
5 times 0 is 0.

00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:49.730
Bring down the 2.

00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:51.030
5 times 5 is 25.

00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:52.860
So, it's 2,520.

00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:55.480
And that is choice c.

00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:56.370
And I'm out of time.

00:09:56.370 --> 00:09:58.170
See you in the next video.
