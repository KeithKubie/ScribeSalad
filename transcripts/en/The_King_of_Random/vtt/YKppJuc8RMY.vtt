00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.100
Hey guys, I am back in the lab again today,

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:03.860
and I brought back my silicone chicken mold

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:06.460
because there's an experiment I want to try with a chocolate chicken

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:08.240
but this one is going to have a twist.

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.160
I went down to the supercenter and picked up some of these coloured melting chocolates.

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.040
Now, these are basically just white chocolate with food colouring added

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.600
but they're all pre-coloured for you.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.460
So basically all we have to do is throw these in the microwave, melt them down

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:19.680
and pour them into our mold.

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.780
The only question I have, is with these being different colours,

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.800
do you think the colours will meld together, and make this thing look terrible,

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.460
or will the colours retain their individuality, and give us a cool rainbow effect?

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:31.440
Let's find out!

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.600
I did a quick google image search to find a picture of a rainbow, and you can see,

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.520
red is at the top and purple is at the bottom.

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.420
and so if we want our chocolate chicken to come out the same,

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:42.620
we need to start by pouring in the red first, and the purple last.

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.600
so that when we turn the chicken over, the rainbow will be in the proper direction, at least that's the theory.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.100
Now if you read the directions it says you should put this chocolate in the microwave half power for 30 seconds at a time

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.240
massage the bag in between sessions to full constitute the choclate

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:02.740
however im not that patient I find if you just put it in full power for 60 seconds,30 seconds,and 10 seconds it has the same effect

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:09.300
so remember 60,30,10 you can follow the directions if you want at least that is  what works well for me in my microwave

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:13.980
our first 60 seconds is up and some of this chocolate is melted and some of it is not.

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:18.820
so we are going to message the bag to spread the temperature evenly throughout all the chocolate inside

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.220
Alright so we are going to throw that back in for another 30 seconds and wait patiently

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.340
*evil laughter*

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.180
starting to feel pretty good

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.920
There is just a few solid clumps left in there to get out

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.100
i think 10 more seconds will do the trick

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.840
so this is the fun part all we have to do now is take a pair of scissors  snip off our corner and pour it into our mold

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.820
just going to smear that around so kinda gets into all kinds of cracks and crevices here.Just for fun

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.860
So red is done orange is next

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.360
Oo that looks really cool

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.900
Looks like cheese.Looks like melted cheese wizz

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:12.620
Cool so we got red and orange next step yellow

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.500
Artificial vanilla flavor ummm

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.500
Ok yellow is up next

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.580
Last bag of chocolate guys all we have to do is snip he tip and pour it in

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:44.060
I don't we could have planned that much better I think its going to come out practically perfect in every way

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.520
Finish up with a nice purple base

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.880
huuuuu look at that

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:53.520
That's about as good as it gets

00:02:53.820 --> 00:03:01.020
So update guys our chocolate chicken mold is full of six different colors of chocolate I hope as long they didn't jiggle and melt together in the process

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:07.440
I'm really curious to know how this is going to turn up but we don't know until we put it in the fridge and give 6-8 hours to set so lets do that next

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:19.120
Our chocolate is in the fridge and its gonna take a few hours for it to fully set up so while we are waiting let me tell you about the company that sponsored this project

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:23.460
The time has come guys our rainbow chocolate chicken has been sitting in the fridge for 5 hours now so I think its firm enough that we can pull it out of the mold

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:28.700
Did the colors stay separate or did they combine into some globby  mess now is the time that we find out

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:30.380
The purple came out pretty nice

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:38.000
Look at these pieces here.This is were I let some of the chocolate smeared over and if we press that we it actually brake off but this is that chocolate and eat them

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:40.180
Don't tell anyone

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:49.000
There we go this is the fun part taking the silicon off

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:54.440
Now its very important with this chicken we go slowly enough that we don't brake one of the legs like it did last time

00:04:54.680 --> 00:05:02.820
Oh man this already starting to look cool it got really awesome marble effect look down here you see yellow,purple,green that blending with others beautifully

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:04.800
Start to get excited

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:07.060
Starting to get a glimpse of the chicken in here look at that

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:12.380
hahahaha oh my goodness that is amazing it looks like it might actually work

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:18.160
We got both the legs in tagged this time that encouraging

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:20.640
AAAAAA I feel that releasing

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:24.980
There we go hahaha check that out guys

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:31.960
One half of our chicken and that is looking rainbow.That is actually really cool that came out of a lot better than I expected

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:34.160
This looks like a candy chicken you could eat

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:40.060
hahahaha look at that guys the world's first rainbow chocolate chicken

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:45.580
That looks really cool I mean if you look at its bottom side there you see he is filled with all kinds of rainbow colors

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:53.600
So apparently all the different chocolate layers did stay separate.They didn't combine after all and it actually gives a really cool effect.This thing looks epic

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:59.120
Now I made a chocolate chicken just out of milk chocolate it kinda look gross because it looked a little bit too real

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:04.000
This looks like a fun funky chicken like I just want to dig my teeth into this thing that is awesome

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:10.240
Well guys I think we are going to call this a success.We have the world's first rainbow chocolate chicken how cool it that

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:16.140
and other than just wanting to sink my teeth into this thing there is only one other urge that I had that is glide a hot knife through it

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:22.220
Now I been in Texas for the last couple of weeks I'm a little bit late to the hot knife challenge but I went ahead and picked up a kitchen knife anyway as well as couple

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:29.520
of propane torches.So if you guys want to see it leave a comment below and I will heat that knife and glide it through this chicken so we can see how it looks inside

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:33.580
In the mean time I going to stick this thing back in the fridge so it can stay nice and firm until tomorrow and

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:35.440
