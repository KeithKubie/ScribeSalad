00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:06.200 position:72%
&gt;&gt; We are thrilled to welcome everyone to the
Second Annual Online Conference for Educators.

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:11.000 position:64%
Our session today, Jefferson's Legacy, a
Brief History of the Library of Congress.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.870
At this point, I want to
introduce our presenter.

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:20.170 position:66%
John Cole is the Library of Congress
historian, a position dedicated to serving

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:25.520 position:61%
as the top technical expert and advisor
on the history of Library of Congress,

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:30.300
documenting institutional history
and conducting historical research.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.610 position:69%
Cole was the founding director of the Center
of The Book at the Library of Congress,

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.880
which was created by law in 1977.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.170
He has been instrumental in
shaping numerous literacy

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:47.680 position:73%
and reading promotion programs during his
50-year tenure at the library and is the author

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.200 position:61%
of several books about the institution.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.900
Welcome John, and take it away.

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.170
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much.

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.090 position:72%
I am very pleased to be here to talk about one

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.490
of my favorite subjects,
the Library of Congress.

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:05.890
Today my purpose is to give you
an overview of the institution,

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.100 position:59%
and basically, what's unique about it.

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.240
Why the Library of Congress is
different from other institutions.

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:20.440 position:75%
Why its stories are interesting, and to give you
enough information to be able to talk about it,

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:28.320 position:72%
and I will be focusing, primarily, on some of
the pivotal characters and also on an overview

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.680 position:61%
of the role of the Library of Congress.

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.850
Our roles are quite interesting.

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:38.890
They're outline before you.

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.280
Serving Congress, we are part
of the legislative branch,

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:47.250
the de facto national library,
which I will talk about briefly.

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.520 position:56%
In modern times, we have become
really an international institution.

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.730 position:63%
We are the home of the Copyright Office,

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:59.790
which is normally an executive
function in most countries.

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:07.280 position:59%
No other de facto national library, I
believe, is also the copyright agency,

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:13.660 position:73%
and because we were created in 1800, we were
one of the first federal cultural institutions.

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:21.130 position:72%
We have developed into a cultural role through
the years that encompasses, in some ways,

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:27.250 position:63%
what happened in other countries through
national archives and national museums.

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:33.030
In our country, you know, that the
Smithsonian was created in 1846.

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.340
The national archives didn't
come along until 1934.

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.840
So that is kind of a defining
factor in the context

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.930 position:69%
of why the Library of Congress is so unique.

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.940
Along the way, we have become
the largest library in the world,

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:52.620
with more than 162 million items.

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:59.770 position:64%
What you see on the screen is the Library
of Congress building that opened in 1897.

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:05.550 position:70%
What a lot of people don't realize is that
we started life in the United States Capital,

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:10.230
and I'm going to take you through
some of the features of that life

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:17.380 position:69%
in the capital before we get to the national
library role, which was consolidated in 1897

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:23.480 position:67%
when this beautiful building you see before
you, which was our Europe Europe, and did,

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.770 position:73%
really established the library's national role.

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:33.030
We started, as I've already
mentioned, in 1800 when John Adams,

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:40.510 position:75%
President John Adams signed a bill appropriating
$5000 for the books for the use of Congress.

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:45.880
Previously, the Congresses were
in New York and in Philadelphia,

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:52.180 position:73%
and they had use of the New York Society
Library in the Library Company of Philadelphia.

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:58.590 position:72%
But when a brand-new capital was built with
the compromise between Jefferson and Hamilton,

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:03.170
Congress had to cough up the
money for its own library.

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:09.530 position:56%
And we started as a small research
library for the Congress, and again,

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:12.950
we were located in the United
States capital all the way

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:17.910 position:61%
until that beautiful Jefferson
Building that I just showed you opened.

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:22.350
But we had a lot of trouble
in the Capital Building.

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:30.730 position:63%
You see illustrated, problem number one,
which was -- and this happened in 1814.

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:37.970 position:61%
It actually, as the war of 1812
progressed, the Americans invaded York,

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:42.140
which was the British capital
now in Canada, Toronto,

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:46.150
and burned their capital
and burned their library.

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:53.690 position:63%
So when the British got to Washington DC
in 1814, the capital, and retaliation,

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:58.910 position:59%
was very much on their mind, and
indeed, the small Library of Congress,

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:05.560 position:67%
of around just a few hundred volumes in the
north end of the Capital, was destroyed.

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:09.940
This was a drawing from Harper's
New Monthly magazine,

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:13.640
depict in the popular notion
which, in fact, was true.

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:23.100 position:70%
That the invaders use the Library of Congress
as kindle, if you will, for the fire.

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:26.220 position:72%
However, to the rescue comes Thomas Jefferson.

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:33.380 position:72%
Now Jefferson, as you know, with the president
of the United States between 1802 to 1809.

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:40.990 position:59%
A book lover, really had in Monticello
a marvelous, comprehensive library

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:48.230 position:75%
that he had built, and he actually nourished the
Library of Congress when it was in the Capital.

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:55.770 position:73%
One of the provisions in the early laws gave
the right to appoint the Librarian of Congress,

00:05:55.770 --> 00:06:01.190 position:66%
a legislative officer, not to Congress,
but to the President of the United States.

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:05.900
This was a compromise in
1802, but it was the Senate

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:10.380 position:59%
to thought the president should do the
appointing, and that is what happened.

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:14.130
So Jefferson was actually able to
appoint the first two librarians

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:16.470 position:63%
of Congress, but they weren't full time.

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:22.290
They were actually also clerks
at the House of Representatives.

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:28.500 position:75%
But the point of the slide is that Jefferson was
disturbed when, of course, he knew what happened

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:34.410 position:58%
in Washington, and he offered to sell
his comprehensive personal library,

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:38.660
which covered many different
subjects, many different languages,

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:42.230 position:59%
to Congress for a price that was fair.

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:48.330 position:64%
He set the offer to a bookseller, who
talked to Congress, and the agreement was

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:54.750
that for roughly 6400 volumes,
6487, were sold to Congress

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:59.990
for roughly $25,000, which
was around $4 a volume.

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:04.340
But the real point was that
this was a new kind of library.

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:06.730
It covered all kinds of subjects.

00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:12.560 position:64%
It covered as much as Jefferson -- it was
the basis for his widespread knowledge,

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:15.090 position:66%
because his knowledge came from his books.

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:17.030
He was a book user.

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:19.730 position:64%
He wanted and used books on all subjects.

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:25.460
So his library included books in
other languages, including music.

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:29.740
It included more geography
than was in the library before.

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:34.760
It had cooking, and his real point
was on the bottom of the screen,

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:37.620 position:75%
a quote in the letter he sent to the bookseller.

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:44.210 position:75%
"There is, in fact, no subject to which a member
of Congress may not have occasion to refer."

00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:49.350 position:70%
Now that's flattering to Congress, of course,
but also, in a real sense it was true.

00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:53.960
And what he was saying is from this
new city capital on the east --

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:58.610
tiny town, actually on the East
Coast, if you have ambitions

00:07:58.610 --> 00:08:02.750
to govern what will someday
be a much larger country.

00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:08.830 position:67%
And of course, Jefferson accounted for much
of that, that you cannot limit yourselves

00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:14.280 position:63%
to legislative books, history books, and
law books, which were the three subjects

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:17.560 position:56%
in the previous Library of Congress.

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:24.620 position:70%
Secondly, he said and noted, and some of his
defenders of his rather controversial measure

00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:31.430 position:70%
in the end, we only purchased this library by
a vote of 10 in the House of Representatives,

00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:36.910
but he and his backers pointed
out that eventually,

00:08:36.910 --> 00:08:41.150
this would be a good basis
for a national library.

00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:45.820 position:63%
The idea they are being that if
Congress needed a comprehensive library,

00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:47.810
so did the American people.

00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:53.700 position:64%
They needed the knowledge in books, which
in a sense, were the Internet of the day,

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:59.450 position:64%
as much is Congress, and there was a
link between the people and their ability

00:08:59.450 --> 00:09:08.900 position:75%
to be well-informed and boat members of Congress
in and out, and printed knowledge at that time.

00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:14.720 position:64%
So he had a two-fold idea, which was both
a library for Congress, and secondly,

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:20.500
and will someday, perhaps, a
library for people, for the nation.

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:26.460 position:64%
But therein lies the basis of the Library
of Congress being a public institution

00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:31.050
and a public library, even
though that isn't in our name.

00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:35.730
We are also, as I've said
earlier, a national library.

00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:37.720
Nor is that in our name.

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:42.510 position:64%
So this is a little bit of the mystery of
the Library of Congress and what it is.

00:09:42.510 --> 00:09:48.580
Our name doesn't describe the
complexity of the institution.

00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:53.100
In the capital, though, we
continue to have a tough time.

00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:58.040
First of all, I'll say a word
about the library committee.

00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:03.250 position:73%
The initial legislation said that the Librarian
of Congress really didn't have a lot of power.

00:10:03.250 --> 00:10:07.350
The power was in the joint
committee on the library,

00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:12.560
which was the very first joint
committee in the Congress.

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:17.420
It was really created/mentioned
in the initial 1800 legislation.

00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:24.240 position:73%
And there were a number of bookish, scholarly
congressman, who were interested in the library

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:31.690 position:70%
and served on the library committee, but they
had full power, and the one congressman --

00:10:31.690 --> 00:10:35.830 position:58%
and let me go back for just a second.

00:10:35.830 --> 00:10:43.030
The Jefferson library did
arrive in 1815, and it was used.

00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:49.080 position:58%
The Library of Congress moved back to
the Capital in 1818 and got started

00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:52.410 position:59%
under the head of the joint committee.

00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:57.430 position:66%
But the man who dominated that committee's
name was Senator Pierce from Maryland,

00:10:57.430 --> 00:11:09.070 position:75%
in the mid-years of the 19th century, from 1846
until 1862, Senator Pierce, who felt the Library

00:11:09.070 --> 00:11:14.700 position:69%
of Congress should not be a national
library, it should be a legislative library,

00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:17.940
dominated the Library of Congress.

00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:23.130
So that national role lay
dormant until after the Civil War.

00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:29.100 position:72%
But, on December 24th, there was an accidental
fire in the capital, and as you can see

00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:37.240 position:63%
from the slide, it destroyed not only
the accumulated books of roughly 55,000,

00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:43.620 position:63%
but it also destroyed 2/3 of Jefferson's
library, and this was a tough blow.

00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:48.720
But I must say Congress,
in spite of Senator Pierce,

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:52.050 position:70%
who actually supported replacing the volumes,

00:11:52.050 --> 00:11:59.710 position:75%
without focusing on going much beyond replacing
them, was supportive of this, and Congress voted

00:11:59.710 --> 00:12:05.050
to say, yes, we want to continue to
have the Library of Congress here,

00:12:05.050 --> 00:12:09.240
and we will vote money; and
furthermore, this time,

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:12.720 position:67%
we will vote money for a fireproof library.

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:20.750 position:72%
And what you see before you is the new Library
of Congress room that opened on August 23rd,

00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:23.290 position:67%
and it was across the front of the capital.

00:12:23.290 --> 00:12:31.840 position:72%
You can't tell from this picture, but that
meant it was a place where the public could go

00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:34.180 position:56%
to get a better view of the Capital.

00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:39.600 position:59%
So we're already starting to mix the
audiences for the Library of Congress.

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:45.410 position:59%
We've got Congress, of course, and
we've now started, because the Library

00:12:45.410 --> 00:12:49.470
of Congress was the first library,
it was a government library,

00:12:49.470 --> 00:12:51.500 position:75%
the first one that covered the whole government,

00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:58.500 position:67%
and we also started letting other executive
agencies use the Library of Congress.

00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:03.940
The public came into the mix here
through this beautiful new room,

00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:12.680 position:59%
which became a tourist place, and the
library started to grow one more time.

00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:18.920
This is the man who really
is the post-Civil War --

00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:22.400 position:75%
he was assistant librarian during the Civil War.

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:31.880 position:72%
He came to Library of Congress in 1861, and
he became librarian in 1864 and was the person

00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:39.310 position:75%
who took that Jeffersonian vision, vision number
two, that this could also be a national library,

00:13:39.310 --> 00:13:47.180 position:64%
and he skillfully persuaded Congress that
the national library idea was something

00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:52.920 position:63%
that should predominate in arguments for
the growth of the Library of Congress,

00:13:52.920 --> 00:14:00.480 position:70%
and it was time of members of Congress to
think about their library in a different way.

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:10.190 position:75%
His idea was that we would accumulate Americana,
books about America, and one grant location,

00:14:10.190 --> 00:14:16.840 position:64%
which would be the capital for the time
being, and that a way to do that would be

00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:22.680
to centralize copyright at the
Library of Congress in the same way

00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:28.270 position:61%
that the European libraries, which were
very much on his mind, had operated.

00:14:28.270 --> 00:14:37.110 position:67%
This was true of both the British Museum
library, started actually a private library

00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:43.240 position:59%
from royalty, but nonetheless, took on
the copyright deposit responsibility.

00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:46.810
And the same was true of
the Bibliothèque Nationale.

00:14:46.810 --> 00:14:54.730 position:72%
Another reason that Spofford thought this
would be important was that back in the 1840s,

00:14:54.730 --> 00:15:00.590
before he came to the Library of
Congress, Congress had experimented

00:15:00.590 --> 00:15:04.790
with sharing copyright deposits
with the new Smithsonian,

00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:10.300
which was opened in 1846,
and the Library of Congress.

00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:17.580
The initial copyright system in the
United States used federal offices

00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:22.270
and did not involve libraries.

00:15:22.270 --> 00:15:29.790 position:72%
Spofford's idea was as the Library of Congress
moved towards becoming a copyright agency,

00:15:29.790 --> 00:15:33.000
he wanted to ask for two copies.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:41.800 position:72%
One is a record copy, and back in 1846, when
there was a brief experiment, both Smithsonian

00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:46.640
and the Library of Congress got
a copy to keep the registrations.

00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:53.050 position:61%
In other words, in return for copyright
protection, that copy was preserved.

00:15:53.050 --> 00:15:56.010
That went away in 1859.

00:15:56.010 --> 00:16:03.580 position:72%
When Spofford came back, his idea is to go
for centralized copyright but with two copies.

00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:06.100
One was for deposit.

00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:09.390
It would be kept by the library.

00:16:09.390 --> 00:16:16.930 position:63%
The second one would be the registration
copy, and it's this idea that really --

00:16:16.930 --> 00:16:20.620
the centralization of copyright,
that did provide the basis

00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:24.350 position:59%
for the Americana collections in 1870.

00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:30.370
Along the way, Spofford was
also a good politician.

00:16:30.370 --> 00:16:39.800 position:75%
And he worked with members of Congress to, first
of all, get himself the job as the library and.

00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:45.030
He came as assistant librarian
in 1861 from Cincinnati,

00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:50.110
where he had been a bookstore
owner, if you can believe it.

00:16:50.110 --> 00:16:57.670 position:70%
Another literary entrepreneur, and that store
went broke, and he became an editorial writer

00:16:57.670 --> 00:17:04.360 position:72%
for the Cincinnati daily commercial, but he
had educated himself and knew about copyright.

00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:07.650
In those days, he wrote editorials
about copyright.

00:17:07.650 --> 00:17:14.600 position:72%
So he was well-prepared once he came to
Washington and joined the staff at the Library

00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:20.860 position:67%
of Congress in 1861 as the assistant
librarian to think about this, and in fact,

00:17:20.860 --> 00:17:30.350 position:75%
he lobbied to get the position of librarian,
which he did when Lincoln appointed him in 1864.

00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:35.820 position:73%
But he lobbied by putting a petition on the
walls of the library in the capital for members

00:17:35.820 --> 00:17:41.770 position:59%
of Congress saying, "If you think I've
done a good job, please sign here,

00:17:41.770 --> 00:17:44.450
and I will let the president know."

00:17:44.450 --> 00:17:51.000 position:73%
These were the days before the president's
appointment of the Librarian of Congress needed

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.030 position:61%
to have the confirmation of the Senate.

00:17:54.030 --> 00:17:56.680
So you needed political support.

00:17:56.680 --> 00:18:02.220 position:64%
You needed to show political support, and
Spofford got that through his petition,

00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:08.200 position:67%
and he got it from letters from other
members of Congress who supported projects.

00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:13.710
And he was named the librarian
of Congress in 1865.

00:18:13.710 --> 00:18:19.350
He immediately got $100,000
to expand the library's rooms.

00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:24.870
He was able to fill them in with
the wonderful Americana collection

00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:29.350
from a man named Peter Force, who
also was the mayor of Washington,

00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:31.820 position:59%
if you can believe that, an archivist.

00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:39.710 position:66%
But the Force Collection occupied one of
the two new expanded rooms in the capital.

00:18:39.710 --> 00:18:44.700
And in the second room, he was
able to put, believe it or not,

00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:50.580 position:67%
the whole Smithsonian library back when
the idea was the Smithsonian might become a

00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:52.250
national library.

00:18:52.250 --> 00:18:59.320 position:73%
It was scotched by Joseph Henry, the director
of the Smithsonian, and by firing the librarian

00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:04.970 position:67%
who was in charge, Henry said, "Some day,
somebody will come to Library of Congress."

00:19:04.970 --> 00:19:10.770 position:73%
And that turned out to be Spofford, and Henry
was so eager to get rid of the Smithsonian idea

00:19:10.770 --> 00:19:15.850
of the National Library, he
actually loaned, permanent loan,

00:19:15.850 --> 00:19:20.230
the entire Smithsonian library
to fill Spofford's second room.

00:19:20.230 --> 00:19:21.830
The rooms were jammed.

00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:24.440
Now Spofford had a new problem.

00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:31.650 position:69%
He had books everywhere, and he had to start
with Congress in trying to persuade them

00:19:31.650 --> 00:19:37.160 position:66%
to have a competition to get the building,
which is the building which we saw

00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:39.270
when we opened this presentation.

00:19:39.270 --> 00:19:41.250
But it took a while to get.

00:19:41.250 --> 00:19:44.780
In time, this drawing, again
from Harper's weekly,

00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:48.630
gives you a sense of the
situation in the library.

00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:54.760 position:73%
Spofford was actually accused of deliberately
putting books on the floor to persuade Congress

00:19:54.760 --> 00:20:01.080 position:66%
to do something about the space problem,
and I think that they may have been right.

00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:04.560 position:67%
But he had a problem that had to be solved.

00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:09.490
Eventually, Congress, in
1886, authorized the building.

00:20:09.490 --> 00:20:15.350
Work began the foundation right
away, and Congress was getting

00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:17.470 position:63%
into the spirit of the national library.

00:20:17.470 --> 00:20:24.740 position:72%
Liked it. Two senators were strong supporters,
and Spofford also had three presidents

00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:30.870 position:75%
in their State of The Union Addresses mention
the Library of Congress as the national library,

00:20:30.870 --> 00:20:36.730 position:70%
and it's too bad that Congress won't do their
work and appropriate money for this building.

00:20:36.730 --> 00:20:41.860 position:63%
They finally did, and by then, Congress
was really feeling it's cultural muscles

00:20:41.860 --> 00:20:47.620 position:59%
in some ways and fired the architects,
brought in the Army Corps of Engineers

00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:53.880 position:69%
to make the building even bigger, and that
was the idea of showing off American culture

00:20:53.880 --> 00:21:00.480 position:70%
and writers and workmanship in a building
that out Europed Europe, and there was plenty

00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:07.110 position:66%
of money coming to the Corps of Engineers,
enough to hire 50 well-known artists,

00:21:07.110 --> 00:21:12.420 position:69%
American sculptors and painters, to decorate
the building, in addition to the workmen

00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:17.640
who had been laboring since 1888.

00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:24.200
And finally, the building was
ready on November 1, 1897,

00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:30.620 position:64%
and one more part of this would be moving
the materials into the new building.

00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:33.200
This is a rather remarkable shot.

00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:36.280 position:64%
Spofford was out of space in the capital.

00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:43.640 position:70%
He really found 16 different rooms throughout
the capital in order to stuff the materials

00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:50.470 position:63%
that he needed, but the key was that the
copyright law included more than books

00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:52.600
in those days, and it does now too.

00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:58.250 position:69%
It includes maps, and prints, and
photographs which later morphed into movies.

00:21:58.250 --> 00:22:05.100 position:70%
Included music, and you see these piles of
materials brought from storage in the capital

00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:08.510
and dumped on the floor of the
new building can you can believe,

00:22:08.510 --> 00:22:11.310 position:67%
it took a couple of years to sort this out.

00:22:11.310 --> 00:22:13.930
But it really is multimedia.

00:22:13.930 --> 00:22:20.180 position:67%
It's the basis of the Library of Congress's
great multimedia collections today,

00:22:20.180 --> 00:22:25.130
because these items came to
us through the copyright law.

00:22:25.130 --> 00:22:35.320 position:64%
Now Spofford had -- was one librarian who
really used the Jeffersonian philosophy,

00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:39.750 position:58%
that you needed a complete
collection for all kinds of purposes.

00:22:39.750 --> 00:22:44.260
But Spofford got copyright
and built the building.

00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:48.370
The second Librarian of Congress
who really moved things ahead,

00:22:48.370 --> 00:22:53.890 position:59%
and here we're hitting the pivotal
people only, man named Herbert Putnam.

00:22:53.890 --> 00:23:00.480 position:70%
By the time Putnam was nominated by President
McKinley, Congress had given itself the power

00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:03.430
to confirm the President's choice.

00:23:03.430 --> 00:23:10.560 position:61%
And Putnam was a also a President Elect
of the American Library Association.

00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:13.230 position:59%
So he brought a different perspective.

00:23:13.230 --> 00:23:19.310 position:66%
Spofford was an old-fashioned but men who
wanted to get the national library started

00:23:19.310 --> 00:23:24.810 position:56%
that didn't look beyond it being the
great American mass of publications

00:23:24.810 --> 00:23:27.440
that people would come to to use.

00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:33.710 position:59%
Putnam reflected the new thinking of
librarians at the turn-of-the-century,

00:23:33.710 --> 00:23:40.370 position:72%
and the idea was that in American
librarianship, one way that you move ahead was

00:23:40.370 --> 00:23:46.020
through cooperative activities such
as cataloging, and he used a method

00:23:46.020 --> 00:23:49.680 position:67%
of centralized cataloging that was possible

00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:56.420
because of the 3 x 5 card
technology that had developed.

00:23:56.420 --> 00:24:03.070 position:75%
And Putnam actually, here he is seen in his
beautiful new office, today's ceremonial office,

00:24:03.070 --> 00:24:07.200
but we call the Jefferson building.

00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:16.490 position:66%
But he decided to not only use catalog
cards, but to print cataloging information

00:24:16.490 --> 00:24:22.580 position:63%
on those cards and then sell them at
cost to libraries and other institutions

00:24:22.580 --> 00:24:29.150 position:67%
around the world, which made the Library of
Congress in the first half of the 40 years

00:24:29.150 --> 00:24:35.280 position:75%
in which Putnam was librarian, it turned us into
a bibliographic center and a great help not just

00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:38.480 position:73%
to libraries but to researchers, who in the era

00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:44.150 position:59%
of union catalogs could start locating
collections all over the country,

00:24:44.150 --> 00:24:46.860
and eventually, all over the world.

00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:54.510 position:72%
Putnam also thought that Spofford hadn't quite
gotten far enough in building collections,

00:24:54.510 --> 00:25:00.980 position:73%
and that we should start, we the Library of
Congress, should go international, and in 1905,

00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:06.290 position:58%
Putnam started sending Library of
Congress employees to other countries

00:25:06.290 --> 00:25:12.250
to investigate collections, and the
first one, really, that was Russia.

00:25:12.250 --> 00:25:17.870 position:69%
He knew of a collection in Russia, and he
sent a library of Congress person over there

00:25:17.870 --> 00:25:20.590 position:56%
to investigate accident he, we ended

00:25:20.590 --> 00:25:26.560 position:56%
up purchasing a huge Russian private
library called the Yudin Collection,

00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:31.270 position:58%
which became the basis of the Library
of Congress's Russian collection.

00:25:31.270 --> 00:25:34.380
He soon did the same for China.

00:25:34.380 --> 00:25:37.360 position:72%
He did the same for other countries in Europe,

00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:41.630
and our international collections
were on the way.

00:25:41.630 --> 00:25:47.560 position:69%
This was in the Jeffersonian spirit, because
Jefferson himself had collected books

00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:52.080
in a number of languages
and on a number of subjects,

00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:55.590 position:70%
and this helped the Library of Congress grow.

00:25:55.590 --> 00:26:02.010 position:75%
And just to give you a sense of what I'm talking
about size, when the Library of Congress moved

00:26:02.010 --> 00:26:06.920 position:69%
into its new building, it had 108 employees.

00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:12.860 position:56%
Actually, when Spofford started back
in 1861, it had seven employees.

00:26:12.860 --> 00:26:20.100 position:73%
And so it skipped from seven to by the time the
move into the Jefferson new building was made

00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:27.620 position:64%
in 1897, it had 42, but half of them
were dealing with copyright registration.

00:26:27.620 --> 00:26:32.590
So Congress took a look, and they
gave the library 108 employees

00:26:32.590 --> 00:26:35.380
in 1897 in the new building.

00:26:35.380 --> 00:26:40.560 position:61%
Putnam added about 200 to that quickly.

00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:47.700 position:67%
But by the time he retired, or stepped
aside to become Librarian Emeritus in 1939,

00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:53.990 position:67%
the Library of Congress had 1000 employees,
and we indeed, the collections had grown

00:26:53.990 --> 00:27:00.090 position:73%
to become the largest library in the world,
which happened in the 1930s, and Putnam pointed

00:27:00.090 --> 00:27:05.770 position:56%
out in his annual report that we had
surpassed the Bibliothèque Nationale

00:27:05.770 --> 00:27:09.170
and the British Library, but
it wasn't a matter of numbers.

00:27:09.170 --> 00:27:16.290 position:66%
It really was the depth and the variety
of things required the Library of Congress

00:27:16.290 --> 00:27:21.890 position:56%
to also build its own classification
system, which lasts until today.

00:27:21.890 --> 00:27:29.640 position:70%
So suddenly, you have a library that's
serving Congress, libraries open to scholars,

00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:32.290 position:61%
and always open to the American public.

00:27:32.290 --> 00:27:36.070
What we hadn't quite developed
was the educational role,

00:27:36.070 --> 00:27:40.800 position:56%
which we are participating in today.

00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:41.960
We welcome tourists.

00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:46.500 position:61%
This is in the tourist hall in the main
building of the Library of Congress.

00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:51.790 position:64%
This actually, this narrow way, which you
can't see very well is that Kenyon Cox,

00:27:51.790 --> 00:27:54.020
the well-known painter of the time.

00:27:54.020 --> 00:27:59.270
The prints are on display, came
from the Smithsonian deposit,

00:27:59.270 --> 00:28:04.060 position:61%
part of what we didn't give back,
which was also a period of negotiations

00:28:04.060 --> 00:28:07.940
for part the collections we had
accumulated from other places.

00:28:07.940 --> 00:28:10.740
But we loved having the tourists.

00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:14.740
I look at that and I see the light
streaming in, and it makes me think

00:28:14.740 --> 00:28:19.950 position:72%
of the preservation function of the Library of
Congress, which hadn't really been developed.

00:28:19.950 --> 00:28:23.230 position:72%
This is a photo, I mentioned the card service,

00:28:23.230 --> 00:28:27.180
of how the cards were stored
in one of the rooms.

00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:32.730 position:58%
And you can see three stories of 3 x
5 cards, and they were filling orders

00:28:32.730 --> 00:28:35.920 position:73%
from around the country in the 30s and the 40s.

00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:41.210 position:69%
This was the bibliographic center
function, which was waiting to be automated,

00:28:41.210 --> 00:28:43.830 position:66%
but certainly had not been in those years.

00:28:43.830 --> 00:28:47.370 position:69%
And it was a major part of what library did.

00:28:47.370 --> 00:28:52.340 position:59%
Another important role in this period,
and there's Putnam on the far left,

00:28:52.340 --> 00:28:59.100 position:67%
is we were the custodian of the Declaration
of Independence and the Constitution.

00:28:59.100 --> 00:29:01.620
There was no National Archives yet.

00:29:01.620 --> 00:29:09.620 position:73%
Putnam what down in 1921 to the State
Department and filled out his forms and managed

00:29:09.620 --> 00:29:16.950 position:73%
to persuade President Harding to transfer the
custody of the Declaration and The Constitution

00:29:16.950 --> 00:29:22.720 position:64%
to the Library of Congress, with the idea
that they would be on permanent display.

00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:26.820
What you see there is President
Coolidge and Putnam and members

00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:32.100 position:66%
of Congress dedicating the shrine in the
Great Hall of the Library of Congress open

00:29:32.100 --> 00:29:36.910 position:58%
to the public, where people could
come and look at those two documents.

00:29:36.910 --> 00:29:44.770 position:56%
And they were with us until -- well,
they were sent during World War I

00:29:44.770 --> 00:29:51.440 position:64%
for safekeeping the Fort Knox, along with
some other treasures, and then finally,

00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:55.550
were returned to the National
Archives after the war.

00:29:55.550 --> 00:29:57.530
They had come back from the war.

00:29:57.530 --> 00:30:02.420 position:69%
Putnam was named Librarian Emeritus in 1939.

00:30:02.420 --> 00:30:10.630 position:70%
There is Archibald McLeish, who was librarian
of Congress from 1939 to '44 in the center,

00:30:10.630 --> 00:30:14.690
examining the return to Declaration
of Independence.

00:30:14.690 --> 00:30:17.870
But it hadn't yet been returned
to the national archives.

00:30:17.870 --> 00:30:21.690
It finally got there in 1952.

00:30:21.690 --> 00:30:24.710
This is yet another role.

00:30:24.710 --> 00:30:32.830 position:56%
We were the home of the Presidential
Papers until the FDR library opened

00:30:32.830 --> 00:30:37.850
and President Truman, of course,
actively promoted that project.

00:30:37.850 --> 00:30:42.510
Actually, I remember reading
about him signing the legislation

00:30:42.510 --> 00:30:45.690 position:72%
so we could microfilm the presidential papers.

00:30:45.690 --> 00:30:52.120 position:72%
So we have all the official papers for all the
presidents up to Roosevelt with the exception

00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:56.130
of the Adamses, and the Adamses
have their own library,

00:30:56.130 --> 00:31:00.520 position:69%
which is not to say we don't have Adamses'
papers, but we don't have the official ones.

00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:04.510
Finally, this is the other
role I wanted to mention.

00:31:04.510 --> 00:31:15.480 position:73%
We really got a lot of education money in the
60s and 70s, and it was the 1965 Impact Program

00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:22.310 position:63%
with money from education to extend what
Putnam had started by giving the Library

00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:28.090 position:61%
of Congress overseas offices to acquire
materials in different countries,

00:31:28.090 --> 00:31:35.120 position:75%
not only for us, but also for research
libraries, starting with public law 480 in 1958,

00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:41.030
but then and 65, it got even more
dramatic, and we ended up opening

00:31:41.030 --> 00:31:43.800 position:59%
up to 14 offices for a certain period.

00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:45.730
We are now down to six.

00:31:45.730 --> 00:31:51.110
But this has always given me a kick
to see a man and a coat and tie,

00:31:51.110 --> 00:31:56.010 position:66%
as a Library of Congress government
representative, going through East Africa,

00:31:56.010 --> 00:32:00.970
gathering up materials to send
back to the Library of Congress.

00:32:00.970 --> 00:32:07.360 position:73%
We're closing with some color pictures of the
Great Hall, which is in the Jefferson Building,

00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:14.400 position:75%
and it gives you a sense of the wonderful
mixture, the grandeur, really of mixing the art,

00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:22.260 position:69%
the sculpture work, the architecture with
thematic classical themes that are universal

00:32:22.260 --> 00:32:30.090 position:64%
and that are showing off, which you can't
see very well, the names of writers,

00:32:30.090 --> 00:32:35.100
both classical writers and poets,
and American writers and poets.

00:32:35.100 --> 00:32:40.180 position:66%
So the building, in some ways, is really
a symbol of American cultural nationalism.

00:32:40.180 --> 00:32:45.690 position:59%
We're showing other cultures, but we
are also making certain people realize

00:32:45.690 --> 00:32:52.150 position:56%
that we are the up-and-coming people
for this, and that we are able

00:32:52.150 --> 00:33:00.400 position:67%
to celebrate our own happenings and our own
figures in different fields of knowledge.

00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:06.610 position:61%
This building also, in the iconography,
is parallel to Jefferson's idea

00:33:06.610 --> 00:33:13.400 position:73%
of comprehensiveness of knowledge, because
each hall has -- this one we're looking across,

00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:16.120 position:73%
but you can't tell, it is a hall of literature.

00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:21.710 position:66%
Up above, the picture is taken from the
West side where we're standing in the Hall

00:33:21.710 --> 00:33:28.400 position:67%
of science, but throughout the iconography,
all fields of knowledge are represented,

00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:31.340 position:59%
as well as figures that are important.

00:33:31.340 --> 00:33:35.600 position:69%
This is Minerva, who if you notice, perhaps,

00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:40.330
going up the stair case overlooking
the main reading room,

00:33:40.330 --> 00:33:45.700
you will find this beautiful
Minerva mosaic by Elihu Vedder.

00:33:45.700 --> 00:33:52.910 position:69%
Minerva was the Roman goddess of everything,
of war, of knowledge, but here she's put

00:33:52.910 --> 00:33:59.150
down her shield and picked up a
rollcall of fields of knowledge,

00:33:59.150 --> 00:34:03.730
which she is defending, in
which she is interested.

00:34:03.730 --> 00:34:09.130 position:66%
And just for safety's sake, in addition to
listing the different fields of knowledge

00:34:09.130 --> 00:34:15.690 position:61%
that are in embedded in the hallways
and windows of this beautiful building,

00:34:15.690 --> 00:34:20.370 position:72%
Vedder added the names of a few
congressional committees, just to make certain

00:34:20.370 --> 00:34:23.680
that Congress realized that
they had not been forgotten

00:34:23.680 --> 00:34:28.140
in this great movement towards
the national institution.

00:34:28.140 --> 00:34:31.450
Our legislative reference
service, our services to Congress,

00:34:31.450 --> 00:34:36.550
have grown along with the National
Library parts of the library.

00:34:36.550 --> 00:34:45.000 position:70%
And finally, this is the inner dome of the
main reading room, and it's a wonderful mural

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:50.520 position:61%
by Edwin Blashfield, and this is
interesting because for the first time,

00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:56.290 position:67%
not for the very first time, but one of the
first times certainly in a public building,

00:34:56.290 --> 00:35:02.060 position:75%
and this is a wonderful public building, one of
the first buildings to be electrified, actually,

00:35:02.060 --> 00:35:08.050 position:69%
and to be built to handle electricity, which
is why you see all of those different bulbs

00:35:08.050 --> 00:35:10.070 position:58%
when we looked at the other pictures.

00:35:10.070 --> 00:35:19.000 position:75%
But here, there is a depiction of other cultures
and America, and it's a little hard to tell,

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:27.230 position:67%
but there are different civilizations which
are depicted, and by each civilization,

00:35:27.230 --> 00:35:31.240
there is the field of knowledge,
which is part --

00:35:31.240 --> 00:35:37.850
the artist felt was typical
of what was being shown.

00:35:37.850 --> 00:35:45.810 position:73%
For example, there's -- the upside-down center
is Egypt, and Egypt and bodies written records,

00:35:45.810 --> 00:35:49.910
and that underneath is given
as Egypt's contribution.

00:35:49.910 --> 00:35:53.180 position:69%
And going around quickly, today is religion.

00:35:53.180 --> 00:35:55.120
Greece is philosophy.

00:35:55.120 --> 00:36:01.160 position:67%
Islam is physics, which is real interesting
for a building that opened in 1897.

00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:03.960 position:61%
As you come around, Italy is fine arts.

00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:05.940
Germany is printing.

00:36:05.940 --> 00:36:07.840
Spain is discovery.

00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:14.290 position:72%
England is literature, and the artist actually
depicted Ellen Terry, a British actress,

00:36:14.290 --> 00:36:19.380 position:59%
who is holding, and this is typical
of each of the paintings, Shakespeare.

00:36:19.380 --> 00:36:23.560
A volume of Shakespeare turned
to Midsummer Night's Dream.

00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:26.250 position:56%
But finally, France is emancipation.

00:36:26.250 --> 00:36:31.000
Then up next to Egypt, you
see upside down here America.

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:38.340 position:59%
And America is depicted by an engineer
sitting on a little dynamo engine,

00:36:38.340 --> 00:36:42.980 position:69%
and in purple, it says the field is science.

00:36:42.980 --> 00:36:47.030
That America is now the leader.

00:36:47.030 --> 00:36:50.260 position:63%
This in some way says, "Thank you world.

00:36:50.260 --> 00:36:54.180
We appreciate these contributions,
but we'll take it from here,

00:36:54.180 --> 00:36:57.600 position:61%
and we're going to do this in science."

00:36:57.600 --> 00:37:00.480 position:73%
And of course, there is a lot of truth in that.

00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:07.550 position:63%
So that is the -- but what's interesting
is this building, again, opened in 1897,

00:37:07.550 --> 00:37:13.920 position:70%
and America was starting to heal not only its
cultural oats but it's imperialistic oats,

00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:21.840 position:70%
and the war came along, the Spanish-American
war was right on the heels of this depiction.

00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:26.850 position:67%
Finally, this is a close-up of what I was
talking about, which is the coming together

00:37:26.850 --> 00:37:34.060 position:75%
of America, which is finally number 12, starting
with Egypt you go around counterclockwise,

00:37:34.060 --> 00:37:38.220
and you can get a look at the
figure for America, which to me,

00:37:38.220 --> 00:37:44.340 position:61%
and this is not documented, is a shaved
Abraham Lincoln in the thinker pose.

00:37:44.340 --> 00:37:48.760
But now you can see the little
part of the little engine

00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:51.630 position:61%
that he's seated on, but not very well.

00:37:51.630 --> 00:37:59.220 position:67%
But it really, again, symbolizes technology
and science and the future of America.

00:37:59.220 --> 00:38:08.050 position:69%
So what you have thenis a building that in
bodies some of the traits of a unique nature

00:38:08.050 --> 00:38:16.990 position:70%
of the organization, which is a library that
covers all subjects, but it's more than that.

00:38:16.990 --> 00:38:20.950
It's a government agency that
had certain government functions.

00:38:20.950 --> 00:38:29.230 position:66%
Because it came early in our history, it's
a historical cradle of different kinds

00:38:29.230 --> 00:38:32.810 position:56%
of cultural, not only artifacts now.

00:38:32.810 --> 00:38:38.670 position:75%
Even though we're not the archives, we still
have some artifacts we picked up, but above all,

00:38:38.670 --> 00:38:45.230 position:56%
it's a library that is open and free
for the use of American Congress

00:38:45.230 --> 00:38:48.810 position:75%
and American civilization and American citizens.

00:38:48.810 --> 00:38:53.740 position:63%
Those are some of the unique features
of the Library of Congress that I wanted

00:38:53.740 --> 00:38:57.670 position:58%
to make certain that I could bring
up and that perhaps we could discuss.
