00:00:06.939 --> 00:00:10.009 line:0%
I went to
look at how people

00:00:10.076 --> 00:00:13.045 line:0%
survive living in
the lower valleys

00:00:13.112 --> 00:00:14.780 line:0%
in the deep valley
of the Himalaya.

00:00:15.347 --> 00:00:16.849
<i> And, so I went
 to Pakistan,</i>

00:00:16.916 --> 00:00:19.419
<i> the area called Hunza
 in Northern Pakistan,</i>

00:00:19.485 --> 00:00:21.387
<i> bordering with
 China to the right</i>

00:00:21.453 --> 00:00:23.322
<i> and Afghanistan,
 the Wakhan Corridor.</i>

00:00:23.389 --> 00:00:25.091
We are down below
where people can

00:00:25.158 --> 00:00:27.460
actually grow,
have agriculture.

00:00:28.894 --> 00:00:30.897
Subsistence agriculture,
it's very difficult.

00:00:30.963 --> 00:00:33.266
It's a harsh
environment, you need

00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:35.268
hard work in order
to grow anything.

00:00:36.102 --> 00:00:38.304 line:0%
<i> The Burusho, they are
 also called Hunzakuts,</i>

00:00:38.371 --> 00:00:39.939 line:0%
<i> they are the
 people of Hunza.</i>

00:00:40.006 --> 00:00:43.076 line:0%
<i> And there is about
 80,000 or so of Burusho.</i>

00:00:43.276 --> 00:00:45.144
They speak their own language

00:00:45.211 --> 00:00:46.579
which nobody really knows
where it comes from.

00:00:46.646 --> 00:00:48.448
The only link they
found with that

00:00:48.514 --> 00:00:51.384
language was in the
Basque Country.

00:00:51.451 --> 00:00:53.787
Imagine the connection, it's
just incredible. Nobody knows.

00:00:54.486 --> 00:00:56.489
<i> So, subsistence agriculture.</i>

00:00:56.556 --> 00:00:59.159
<i> This is Samhina tending
 to a potato field</i>

00:00:59.225 --> 00:01:02.762
<i> below the Altit Fort,
 over 1,000-year old fort.</i>

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:05.832
<i> Down below is the Hunza
 River, 1500-feet below.</i>

00:01:05.898 --> 00:01:07.734
<i> And so this is
 subsistence agriculture.</i>

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.570
<i> You find any land
 possible to grow.</i>

00:01:10.637 --> 00:01:12.371
<i> Potato since
 fairly recently</i> .

00:01:13.372 --> 00:01:17.343
<i> And the village right
 behind, fortified villages</i>

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:21.280
<i>often for cold, for protection.
It's part of the old Silk Road.</i>

00:01:21.347 --> 00:01:24.049
<i> There used to be lots of raids
 traditionally from caravans.</i>

00:01:24.717 --> 00:01:27.754
<i> And so they live in a very
 strong community atmosphere</i>

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.922
<i> because of this
 closeness they have.</i>

00:01:29.989 --> 00:01:32.091
<i> And if we go into that
 house that is up there</i>

00:01:32.157 --> 00:01:34.360
<i> you know, you walk into this
 kind of beautiful scene.</i>

00:01:34.427 --> 00:01:35.962
<i> So this is life
 in Hunza indoor.</i>

00:01:36.028 --> 00:01:37.663
<i> Very simple kitchen .</i>

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:39.265
<i> And then you get
 offered tea like</i>

00:01:39.332 --> 00:01:40.899
<i> anywhere there,
 salted tea.</i>

00:01:40.966 --> 00:01:43.869
<i> So, this rock, you see
 that it's rock salt.</i>

00:01:43.936 --> 00:01:46.605
<i>So you get-- pour your milk tea</i>

00:01:46.672 --> 00:01:48.774
and you take the
rock and use it to

00:01:48.841 --> 00:01:50.609
stir your milk,
your tea in there

00:01:50.676 --> 00:01:52.945
and it will give
salt to your tea.

00:01:53.012 --> 00:01:55.315
You know, traditionally
salt is,

00:01:55.381 --> 00:01:57.483
has always been fairly
easily accessible.

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.786
You can find areas
with this rock salt.

00:02:00.986 --> 00:02:03.857
But sugar is not part of the,

00:02:03.923 --> 00:02:05.824
you know, traditionally
their diet.

00:02:05.891 --> 00:02:07.793
It's just... it needs
to come from far away.

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.397
This village you saw is really
Hunza, is Central Hunza.

00:02:11.463 --> 00:02:12.898
I wanted to go a bit further

00:02:12.965 --> 00:02:15.501
to really walk away as much
as possible from market food.

00:02:16.135 --> 00:02:17.770
<i> So we went further
 north towards the</i>

00:02:17.836 --> 00:02:19.638
<i> border with China
 over this lake</i>

00:02:19.705 --> 00:02:21.974
<i> that was formed by
 a huge avalanche</i>

00:02:22.041 --> 00:02:23.809
<i> in January 2011,
 I think.</i>

00:02:23.876 --> 00:02:27.213
<i> And now we have the 30-miles
 and about a mile deep lake</i>

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.249
<i> that was formed
 by this whole</i>

00:02:29.315 --> 00:02:30.416
<i> mountain that fell
 in the valley</i>

00:02:30.483 --> 00:02:32.351
<i> basically in the
 Hunza Valley.</i>

00:02:32.418 --> 00:02:34.687
<i> So, in winter it means
 crossing with a boat.</i>

00:02:35.288 --> 00:02:36.922
<i> The lake receded
 a little bit in</i>

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:38.658
<i> winter and left this
 carcass of a boat</i>

00:02:38.724 --> 00:02:40.960
<i> which was quite surreal in
 the mountains to see that.</i>

00:02:41.494 --> 00:02:43.429
<i> If you look down while you
drive after you've left the boat</i>

00:02:43.496 --> 00:02:44.930
<i> you see the Hunza River</i>

00:02:44.997 --> 00:02:46.365
<i> and you see this
 hanging bridge and</i>

00:02:46.432 --> 00:02:48.100
<i> often there's people
 walking on them</i> .

00:02:48.167 --> 00:02:50.536
<i> They are going from the
 village to the pastures.</i>

00:02:50.736 --> 00:02:53.539
<i> Both in winter and in summer
 they go to the pastures.</i>

00:02:53.606 --> 00:02:55.507
<i> I don't know if you
 can see but there's</i>

00:02:55.574 --> 00:02:58.477
about this gap
between each step

00:02:58.544 --> 00:03:02.649
on the bridge, with the
wind it's often moving.

00:03:02.715 --> 00:03:04.917
And you get this
60-year old grandma

00:03:04.983 --> 00:03:06.052
you know, coming,
just cruising through

00:03:06.119 --> 00:03:08.420
there and you arrive
and are like, "whoa".

00:03:08.487 --> 00:03:10.857
Very impressive. So, let's
zoom in to this woman.

00:03:10.923 --> 00:03:12.324
<i> I arrived and I
 crossed that bridge</i>

00:03:12.758 --> 00:03:14.026
<i> and I arrived
 in the pasture.</i>

00:03:14.093 --> 00:03:15.928
<i> This woman brought
 me apples.</i>

00:03:15.995 --> 00:03:18.630
<i> This is a Poplar forest
 that was grown by,</i>

00:03:18.697 --> 00:03:21.100
<i> you know, ancestors
 of this woman here.</i>

00:03:21.167 --> 00:03:23.302
<i> If you zoom in a bit more,
 this is what they are doing.</i>

00:03:23.369 --> 00:03:26.238
<i> They go there, most in
 winter, mostly to cut wood.</i>

00:03:26.305 --> 00:03:28.540
<i> They are cutting
 this sea buckthorn</i>

00:03:28.607 --> 00:03:30.176
<i> that grows very quickly</i>

00:03:30.242 --> 00:03:32.845
<i> and they have a rotating
 system within the community.</i>

00:03:32.912 --> 00:03:34.747
<i> So it's sustainable
 and it can regrow.</i>

00:03:34.814 --> 00:03:37.049
<i> And these grandmas
 they go around,</i>

00:03:37.116 --> 00:03:38.984
<i> you know, these older ladies
 or younger ladies, whatever</i>

00:03:39.051 --> 00:03:42.355
<i> they go in the pasture
 to cut wood every day.</i>

00:03:42.421 --> 00:03:44.022
They walk about two
hours round-trip

00:03:44.089 --> 00:03:45.758
to bring back
and they use it

00:03:45.824 --> 00:03:48.193
they need that wood for cooking
and for heating the house.

00:03:48.928 --> 00:03:51.997
<i> The sea buckthorn
 has these berries on it</i>

00:03:52.064 --> 00:03:54.566
<i> that are easily
 gathered in winter</i>

00:03:54.633 --> 00:03:56.402
<i> when the berry
 are frozen.</i>

00:03:56.636 --> 00:03:58.438
<i> Because in summer if you
 take them, they break.</i>

00:03:58.504 --> 00:04:00.039
<i> The skin is too thin.</i>

00:04:00.106 --> 00:04:02.808
<i> Great heart tonic and
 lower cholesterol.</i>

00:04:02.875 --> 00:04:04.677
<i> You know, they eat that
 all the time there.</i>

00:04:04.743 --> 00:04:06.745
<i> The women also
 bring back hay for</i>

00:04:06.812 --> 00:04:08.614
<i> the animals, to
 feed the cows.</i>

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.115
<i> These women go out
 every day and</i>

00:04:10.182 --> 00:04:11.751
<i> they are just
 having a blast.</i>

00:04:11.984 --> 00:04:14.220
<i> They are laughing all the
 time, talking all the time</i>

00:04:14.287 --> 00:04:16.222
<i> they really look forward
 to these outings.</i>

00:04:16.288 --> 00:04:17.823
They are going to
walk away from the men,

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:19.959
walk away from the village
and gossip all they want.

00:04:20.026 --> 00:04:22.095
They got this funny guy walking
around following them.

00:04:22.161 --> 00:04:23.596
We had a blast that day.

00:04:23.663 --> 00:04:26.265
It was really just a
fantastic, you know...

00:04:26.332 --> 00:04:27.867
Just really great.

00:04:27.934 --> 00:04:29.768
It is work but to
them it's just...

00:04:29.835 --> 00:04:31.136
they do that
every day.

00:04:31.203 --> 00:04:32.738
<i> Soon enough
 I get invited</i>

00:04:32.805 --> 00:04:34.640
<i> right and left into houses.</i>

00:04:34.707 --> 00:04:38.577
<i> Great atmosphere, very tight
family bonds in North Pakistan.</i>

00:04:38.644 --> 00:04:41.547
<i> This woman is preparing
 flat bread, "chapati".</i>

00:04:41.613 --> 00:04:44.717
<i> And they do all kind of
 different variation of that</i>

00:04:44.783 --> 00:04:46.185
<i> around chapati, with
 this flat bread.</i>

00:04:46.251 --> 00:04:47.586
<i> It's the main thing.</i>

00:04:47.653 --> 00:04:49.289
<i> It's grown
 always locally</i> .

00:04:49.355 --> 00:04:51.224
<i> On the upper left
 it's called "Chap churo"</i> ,

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:52.825
<i> layers of flat bread</i>

00:04:52.892 --> 00:04:56.929
<i> it's a bit like a pancake with
 diluted milk and apricot oil.</i>

00:04:56.996 --> 00:04:59.565
<i> There's buckwheat on the upper
 right with mulberry syrup.</i>

00:04:59.632 --> 00:05:02.034
<i> And then apricot
 down there.</i>

00:05:02.101 --> 00:05:05.604
There's places where I went
where there was no real dinner.

00:05:05.671 --> 00:05:09.709
The act of eating wasn't
a ritualistic kind of...

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:12.211
experience.

00:05:12.345 --> 00:05:14.647
<i> But in North Pakistan,
it's really people gather round.</i>

00:05:14.714 --> 00:05:16.048
<i> There's usually one
 common plate,</i>

00:05:16.115 --> 00:05:18.350
<i> so you reach out together
 into one plate.</i>

00:05:18.417 --> 00:05:20.653
<i> It's a very important
 moment to get together.</i>

00:05:21.453 --> 00:05:24.857
Apricot is very important.
They make this--

00:05:24.924 --> 00:05:27.359
Apparently pasta came from
that part of the world

00:05:27.426 --> 00:05:29.295
<i> from Western China,
 not too far away.</i>

00:05:29.362 --> 00:05:31.497
<i> They roll out this
 chapati very thin and</i>

00:05:31.563 --> 00:05:34.466
<i> then cut it in slices,
 and make pasta,</i>

00:05:34.533 --> 00:05:36.702
<i> and then mix it with dried
 apricot from the summer.</i>

00:05:36.769 --> 00:05:38.738
<i> They dry a lot of their
 fruits and vegetables</i>

00:05:38.804 --> 00:05:40.640
<i> so that they can
 keep all year round.</i>

00:05:40.706 --> 00:05:43.509
<i> And they mix it together
 with the pasta, the apricot</i>

00:05:43.576 --> 00:05:45.478
<i> and get this quite
 delicious dish.</i>

00:05:46.445 --> 00:05:48.214
<i> Rarely do people
 hunt there</i>

00:05:48.281 --> 00:05:49.615
<i> because they are
 herders as well.</i>

00:05:49.682 --> 00:05:52.752
<i> But some time ducks that fly
 over from Siberia to India</i>

00:05:52.819 --> 00:05:55.120
<i> get stranded in valleys
 and then they cook them.</i>

00:05:55.187 --> 00:05:57.489
<i> This guy Yahyah Naig
 on the right has been</i>

00:05:57.556 --> 00:05:59.525
<i> hunting the whole day
 to get this duck.</i>

00:05:59.592 --> 00:06:02.695
<i> Their tractor is the bull,
they use manure for fertilizer.</i>

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:04.730
In every duration,
whether it is

00:06:04.797 --> 00:06:06.231
peace, whether
it is trouble,

00:06:06.298 --> 00:06:07.834
whether it is earthquake,

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:10.302
whether it is
something calamity.

00:06:10.369 --> 00:06:12.204
So, Inshallah the
world will come

00:06:12.705 --> 00:06:15.441
very peaceful and
we shall be one.

00:06:15.508 --> 00:06:17.676
And because the world
is becoming now

00:06:17.743 --> 00:06:21.079
a universal village,
a global village.

00:06:21.146 --> 00:06:25.184
Being a teacher I have been
teaching my students to be

00:06:25.251 --> 00:06:28.453
to be very, very,
very cooperative

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:31.424
and think about
universality.

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:34.727
So that we can live
together peacefully.

00:06:35.895 --> 00:06:38.497
Just a little talk with your
average, you know, farmer.

00:06:38.998 --> 00:06:41.634
It happens a lot in
Pakistan and I love it.

00:06:41.701 --> 00:06:43.235
<i> But this is part
 of my, you know,</i>

00:06:43.302 --> 00:06:45.004
<i> excitement of being
 a photographer</i> .
