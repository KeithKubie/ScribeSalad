- I'm Chris Cotton, and I'm
here at Comedy Central's

00:00:02.635 --> 00:00:03.903 line:0%
Roast of Bruce Willis,
and I have one question:

00:00:03.903 --> 00:00:06.072 line:0%
Whachu talkin' 'bout, Willis?

00:00:06.072 --> 00:00:06.906
Willis?

00:00:06.906 --> 00:00:07.741
- Willis?

00:00:07.741 --> 00:00:08.942
- Willis?

00:00:08.942 --> 00:00:09.676 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Oh, I see what you
did there and I like it.

00:00:09.676 --> 00:00:11.811
(Hip-Hop music)

00:00:11.811 --> 00:00:13.446 line:0%
- So we wanna ask you a couple
trivia questions real quick.

00:00:13.446 --> 00:00:14.681 line:0%
All right?

00:00:14.681 --> 00:00:15.915 line:0%
- Okay, do any of
them consist of:

00:00:15.915 --> 00:00:17.117 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
"Am I gonna sleep
with Bruce Willis?"?

00:00:17.117 --> 00:00:20.587 align:start size:88% position:13% line:0%
- In what year did Bruce
Willis first appear

00:00:20.587 --> 00:00:21.988 line:0%
fully bald in a film?

00:00:21.988 --> 00:00:23.256
- I don't know.

00:00:23.256 --> 00:00:24.391
I'm gonna go with the
year I was born, 1989.

00:00:24.391 --> 00:00:25.492
- Okay, 2007.

00:00:26.593 --> 00:00:27.494
- Oh, I'm sorry, Bruce.

00:00:27.494 --> 00:00:28.895
- Exactly, I think.

00:00:28.895 --> 00:00:29.963
- The roast starts now.

00:00:29.963 --> 00:00:31.464
(laughing)

00:00:31.464 --> 00:00:33.933 line:0%
- If Bruce Willis was an
animal, what would he be?

00:00:33.933 --> 00:00:36.236
- I would say he
would be a hyena.

00:00:36.236 --> 00:00:40.240
Female hyenas have
pseudo-penises, which
are about 15 to 16

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.642 align:start size:97% position:3%
inches long, and that's
what I envision from Bruce.

00:00:42.642 --> 00:00:43.743
- How you doing, Jeff?

00:00:43.743 --> 00:00:46.046 line:0%
- Good. Call me Kim Jeff Un.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.715 line:0%
- Kim Jeff Un?

00:00:48.715 --> 00:00:51.151 align:start size:94% position:6% line:0%
- AKA the ultimate
villain, the roast master.

00:00:51.151 --> 00:00:52.652
I'm coming for you Bruce Willis.

00:00:52.652 --> 00:00:54.187
(laughing)

00:00:54.187 --> 00:00:55.789 align:start size:97% position:3%
The ultimate hero's gonna meet
the ultimate villain today.

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:58.324 align:start size:97% position:3%
And by the way, I loved
you as the cop in Die Hard.

00:00:58.324 --> 00:01:00.126 align:start size:81% position:19%
- Listen man, I
try to do my best.

00:01:00.126 --> 00:01:02.729
I kept slim, I'm working out
a lot, you know what I mean?

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:04.030
- You look great.

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.533
(Hip-Hop music)

00:01:06.533 --> 00:01:10.603 align:start size:94% position:6%
- In which movie did Bruce
Willis show his willy?

00:01:11.638 --> 00:01:12.605
- I don't know.

00:01:12.605 --> 00:01:13.540
- You don't know?

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:14.441
- No, why don't I know this?

00:01:14.441 --> 00:01:16.009
- In The Color of Money.

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:17.277
- The Color of Night.

00:01:17.277 --> 00:01:18.511
- The Color of Night.

00:01:18.511 --> 00:01:19.446
- When would this
movie come out?

00:01:19.446 --> 00:01:20.880
- It came out a while back.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.782 align:start size:94% position:6% line:0%
- Did you know Bruce
Willis' character was dead

00:01:22.782 --> 00:01:24.451 line:0%
in Sixth Sense when
you first watched it?

00:01:24.451 --> 00:01:25.685 line:0%
- No.

00:01:25.685 --> 00:01:27.520 line:0%
- No, I was like seven,
I didn't think ahead.

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:28.988 line:0%
- Spoiler alert, man.

00:01:28.988 --> 00:01:30.657 line:0%
You just ruined the movie
for a whole generation

00:01:30.657 --> 00:01:32.959 line:0%
of people that could've
enjoyed The Sixth Sense.

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:33.927 line:0%
- He was dead in this one.

00:01:33.927 --> 00:01:35.095 line:0%
- And now it's ruined.

00:01:35.095 --> 00:01:35.895 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Did you know
though, first watch?

00:01:35.895 --> 00:01:37.130
- No, I didn't know.

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:38.598
Nobody knows, that's
why you ruined it.

00:01:38.598 --> 00:01:40.667
(Hip-Hop music)

00:01:40.667 --> 00:01:41.501
- Here's a quote.

00:01:41.501 --> 00:01:42.469
- Okay.

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:43.436 line:0%
- Let me know what this is from.

00:01:43.436 --> 00:01:44.671 line:0%
- Okay.

00:01:44.671 --> 00:01:47.273 align:start size:81% position:19%
- "Zed's dead,
baby, Zed's dead."

00:01:47.273 --> 00:01:48.608
- That would be Pulp Fiction.

00:01:48.608 --> 00:01:49.909
- Pulp Fiction.

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:51.177
- I don't know how he
got it, Pulp Fiction.

00:01:51.177 --> 00:01:53.780
- "I'm a world class
assassin, (beep) yeah.

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.950
How do you think I found out?"

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.718
- The Sixth Sense.

00:01:58.718 --> 00:02:00.353 align:start size:97% position:3%
- No, he wasn't an assassin
in The Sixth Sense,

00:02:00.353 --> 00:02:01.721
he was a psychologist.

00:02:01.721 --> 00:02:02.956
- Lucky Number Slevin.

00:02:02.956 --> 00:02:04.124
- My sister was in that.

00:02:04.124 --> 00:02:05.058
- [Chris] That's good.

00:02:05.058 --> 00:02:06.259

movie, good movie.

00:02:07.427 --> 00:02:08.928 line:0%
All right.

Police man asked, "Are you
classified as a human?"

00:02:11.097 --> 00:02:14.634 align:start size:97% position:3% line:0%
Willis responds, "Negative.
I am a meat popsicle."

00:02:14.634 --> 00:02:17.070 align:start size:97% position:3%
- That is from, actually,
when he appeared on Friends.

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:18.304
(laughing)

00:02:18.304 --> 00:02:19.873
That's what he said
to Jennifer Anniston.

00:02:19.873 --> 00:02:22.175 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Actually it was from Fifth
Element, but thank you.

00:02:22.175 --> 00:02:23.409

high school nickname?

00:02:26.646 --> 00:02:27.847

- Daddy?

- Boy, Bruce Willis'

(mumbling)

00:02:33.052 --> 00:02:34.053
- Buck Buck.

00:02:35.455 --> 00:02:39.626
- This is the creepiest thing
ever, but the Gimp got it.

00:02:39.626 --> 00:02:42.562 align:start size:97% position:3%
For all the points in the
world, give it up, Buck Buck.

00:02:42.562 --> 00:02:43.396
Thank you Gimp.
