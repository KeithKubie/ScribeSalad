00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.200
So we are currently looking at viewcontroller.swift.

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.480
This is the file that has the record audio function.

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.600
Remember this is the function that gets called when the user presses

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:10.810
the microphone button.

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:14.830
In here, I want to write some code that records the user's voice.

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:18.200
But before I do that, I want to change the name of this file.

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.280
Right now it's called a genetic ViewController.swift.

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:25.470
Since the majority of what we want to do in this file is record the user's audio

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.170
or sound, I want to change the name of this file to RecordSoundsViewController.

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:34.120
To do that requires me to do four main things, see if you can follow along.

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.610
I will change the name of the file in the navigator.

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.720
I can call it RecordSoundsViewController.

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.480
Then I will scroll up to the top of the file and change this comment.

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.320
I will also change the name of the class, and

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.910
then finally I will go to storyboard, and

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:55.220
in here I will select the first scene, and then drag out utility area.

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:59.730
And underneath Identity Inspector I will select the new name for

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.510
this class, which is RecordSoundsViewController.

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.490
Okay, let me see if these changes are still working.

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.330
Let me click on this microphone button, and then the stop, and try and

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.970
play some audio.

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.240
&gt;&gt; My momma always said, life was like a box of chocolates.

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.280
&gt;&gt; All right, the movie quote is still playing.

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:19.370
That looks good.

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:23.410
In the next video, I will search for how to record the user's voice in our app
