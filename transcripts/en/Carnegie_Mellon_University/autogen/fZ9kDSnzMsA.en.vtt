yes so the the systems interoperate to a

extend to our networks too so it's not
 

00:10:48.649 --> 00:10:50.319
extend to our networks too so it's not
just the Geographic borders we we

00:10:50.319 --> 00:10:50.329
just the Geographic borders we we
 

00:10:50.329 --> 00:10:52.000

them and we can't we don't share beyond

them certain types of critical data

that's sensitive

that's sensitive
 

00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:00.610
that's sensitive
but there is a the u.s. is working very

00:11:00.610 --> 00:11:00.620
but there is a the u.s. is working very
 

00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:02.950
but there is a the u.s. is working very
hard and the meetings I've been in they

hard and the meetings I've been in they
 

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:05.200

are emphasizing the need to open up more

are emphasizing the need to open up more
 

00:11:05.210 --> 00:11:07.510
are emphasizing the need to open up more
of that data to more people that are

00:11:07.510 --> 00:11:07.520
of that data to more people that are
 

00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:08.920
of that data to more people that are
helping us to fight the war and that's

00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:08.930
helping us to fight the war and that's
 

00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:10.750
helping us to fight the war and that's
the I think that is one of the big

00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:10.760
the I think that is one of the big

little bit about how do we make these
 

00:15:05.370 --> 00:15:06.590
little bit about how do we make these
systems usable because

00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:06.600
systems usable because
 

00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:08.930
systems usable because
I think I'm an expert in computers but I

00:15:08.930 --> 00:15:08.940
I think I'm an expert in computers but I
 

00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:11.240
I think I'm an expert in computers but I
hate looking at these stupid privacy

00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:11.250
hate looking at these stupid privacy
 

00:15:11.250 --> 00:15:13.189
hate looking at these stupid privacy
notices when I log into a website i have

00:15:13.189 --> 00:15:13.199
notices when I log into a website i have
 

00:15:13.199 --> 00:15:17.990
notices when I log into a website i have
no idea what I'm signing up for yeah so

00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:18.000
no idea what I'm signing up for yeah so
 

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.819
no idea what I'm signing up for yeah so
that's the challenge is to make it

00:15:19.819 --> 00:15:19.829
that's the challenge is to make it
 

00:15:19.829 --> 00:15:23.509
that's the challenge is to make it
secure in private and and usable and I

00:15:23.509 --> 00:15:23.519
secure in private and and usable and I
 

00:15:23.519 --> 00:15:26.030
secure in private and and usable and I
think until recently there hadn't been a

00:15:26.030 --> 00:15:26.040
think until recently there hadn't been a
 

00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:28.579
think until recently there hadn't been a
whole lot of work in that direction for

00:15:28.579 --> 00:15:28.589
whole lot of work in that direction for
 

00:15:28.589 --> 00:15:30.319
whole lot of work in that direction for
the most part you know security people

00:15:30.319 --> 00:15:30.329
the most part you know security people
 

00:15:30.329 --> 00:15:32.360
the most part you know security people
when they when they did their threat

00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:32.370
when they when they did their threat
 

00:15:32.370 --> 00:15:33.949
when they when they did their threat
modeling you know they were they were

00:15:33.949 --> 00:15:33.959
modeling you know they were they were
 

00:15:33.959 --> 00:15:36.050
modeling you know they were they were
basically looking at the you know the

00:15:36.050 --> 00:15:36.060
basically looking at the you know the
 

00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:39.110
basically looking at the you know the
evil the evil e vino and then what that

00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:39.120
evil the evil e vino and then what that
 

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:41.569
evil the evil e vino and then what that
was a threat to the system and not

00:15:41.569 --> 00:15:41.579
was a threat to the system and not
 

00:15:41.579 --> 00:15:44.210
was a threat to the system and not
really paying attention to the the

00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:44.220
really paying attention to the the
 

00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:46.790
really paying attention to the the
normal users of the system and the kind

00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:46.800
normal users of the system and the kind
 

00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:48.290
normal users of the system and the kind
of threat they pose because they can't

00:15:48.290 --> 00:15:48.300
of threat they pose because they can't
 

00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:49.759
of threat they pose because they can't
figure out how to use it properly and

00:15:49.759 --> 00:15:49.769
figure out how to use it properly and
 

00:15:49.769 --> 00:15:52.370
figure out how to use it properly and
that actually poses a big threat and so

00:15:52.370 --> 00:15:52.380
that actually poses a big threat and so
 

00:15:52.380 --> 00:15:53.930
that actually poses a big threat and so
in our work we've been looking at how do

00:15:53.930 --> 00:15:53.940
in our work we've been looking at how do
 

00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:57.259
in our work we've been looking at how do
we take into account the abilities of

00:15:57.259 --> 00:15:57.269
we take into account the abilities of
 

00:15:57.269 --> 00:16:00.769
we take into account the abilities of
the of the normal users and their

00:16:00.769 --> 00:16:00.779
the of the normal users and their
 

00:16:00.779 --> 00:16:03.110
the of the normal users and their
interests and their motivations and the

00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:03.120
interests and their motivations and the
 

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:05.930
interests and their motivations and the
fact that they don't really want to have

00:16:05.930 --> 00:16:05.940
fact that they don't really want to have
 

00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:07.699
fact that they don't really want to have
to spend a lot of time doing security

00:16:07.699 --> 00:16:07.709
to spend a lot of time doing security
 

00:16:07.709 --> 00:16:09.829
to spend a lot of time doing security
they don't feel like it's their job and

00:16:09.829 --> 00:16:09.839
they don't feel like it's their job and
 

00:16:09.839 --> 00:16:11.960
they don't feel like it's their job and
you know you can put up all the posters

00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:11.970
you know you can put up all the posters
 

00:16:11.970 --> 00:16:13.370
you know you can put up all the posters
in the workplace that security is

00:16:13.370 --> 00:16:13.380
in the workplace that security is
 

00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:16.460
in the workplace that security is
everyone's job but most people say hey

00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:16.470
everyone's job but most people say hey
 

00:16:16.470 --> 00:16:18.290
everyone's job but most people say hey
it's not really my job you know someone

00:16:18.290 --> 00:16:18.300
it's not really my job you know someone
 

00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:20.389
it's not really my job you know someone
else to do that so we've been we've been

00:16:20.389 --> 00:16:20.399
else to do that so we've been we've been
 

00:16:20.399 --> 00:16:22.009
else to do that so we've been we've been
looking at how how do we come up with

00:16:22.009 --> 00:16:22.019
looking at how how do we come up with
 

00:16:22.019 --> 00:16:23.569
looking at how how do we come up with
models so that we can take all of that

00:16:23.569 --> 00:16:23.579
models so that we can take all of that
 

00:16:23.579 --> 00:16:26.870
models so that we can take all of that
into account and also try to counter

00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:26.880
into account and also try to counter
 

00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:28.790
into account and also try to counter
some of the mythology of security that

00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:28.800
some of the mythology of security that
 

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:30.650
some of the mythology of security that
there's a lot of things that we do

00:16:30.650 --> 00:16:30.660
there's a lot of things that we do
 

00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:33.319
there's a lot of things that we do
because we just well everybody knows

00:16:33.319 --> 00:16:33.329
because we just well everybody knows
 

00:16:33.329 --> 00:16:35.689
because we just well everybody knows
right you do that and it turns out that

00:16:35.689 --> 00:16:35.699
right you do that and it turns out that
 

00:16:35.699 --> 00:16:37.579
right you do that and it turns out that
it's actually not increasing our

00:16:37.579 --> 00:16:37.589
it's actually not increasing our
 

00:16:37.589 --> 00:16:39.860
it's actually not increasing our
security a whole lot but it is making

00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:39.870
security a whole lot but it is making
 

00:16:39.870 --> 00:16:42.740
security a whole lot but it is making
things really inconvenient so for

00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:42.750
things really inconvenient so for
 

00:16:42.750 --> 00:16:45.470
things really inconvenient so for
example one that you probably all can

00:16:45.470 --> 00:16:45.480
example one that you probably all can
 

00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:50.269
example one that you probably all can
relate to is passwords recently CMU for

00:16:50.269 --> 00:16:50.279
relate to is passwords recently CMU for
 

00:16:50.279 --> 00:16:51.740
relate to is passwords recently CMU for
the andrew network they made everybody

00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:51.750
the andrew network they made everybody
 

00:16:51.750 --> 00:16:53.629
the andrew network they made everybody
change their password and they said that

00:16:53.629 --> 00:16:53.639
change their password and they said that
 

00:16:53.639 --> 00:16:55.910
change their password and they said that
we now all have to have a capital letter

00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:55.920
we now all have to have a capital letter
 

00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:58.249
we now all have to have a capital letter
or a lowercase letter a symbol and a

00:16:58.249 --> 00:16:58.259
or a lowercase letter a symbol and a
 

00:16:58.259 --> 00:17:01.970
or a lowercase letter a symbol and a
number in our password and in theory

00:17:01.970 --> 00:17:01.980
number in our password and in theory
 

00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:04.760
number in our password and in theory
that's to make it more secure but it's

00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:04.770
that's to make it more secure but it's
 

00:17:04.770 --> 00:17:06.230
that's to make it more secure but it's
not really clear that that actually

00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:06.240
not really clear that that actually
 

00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:08.770
not really clear that that actually
makes passwords more secure and we're

00:17:08.770 --> 00:17:08.780
makes passwords more secure and we're
 

00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:11.419
makes passwords more secure and we're
it's actually inspired my students to

00:17:11.419 --> 00:17:11.429
it's actually inspired my students to
 

00:17:11.429 --> 00:17:13.130
it's actually inspired my students to
kind of spontaneously start a research

00:17:13.130 --> 00:17:13.140
kind of spontaneously start a research
 

00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:14.960
kind of spontaneously start a research
project looking at how you can maximize

00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:14.970
project looking at how you can maximize
 

00:17:14.970 --> 00:17:18.350
project looking at how you can maximize
password entropy while minimizing the

00:17:18.350 --> 00:17:18.360
password entropy while minimizing the
 

00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:18.660
password entropy while minimizing the
pain

00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:18.670
pain
 

00:17:18.670 --> 00:17:21.510
pain
into the to the users and surprisingly

00:17:21.510 --> 00:17:21.520
into the to the users and surprisingly
 

00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:22.980
into the to the users and surprisingly
they're actually hasn't been very much

00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:22.990
they're actually hasn't been very much
 

00:17:22.990 --> 00:17:24.810
they're actually hasn't been very much
research in that area and so that's

00:17:24.810 --> 00:17:24.820
research in that area and so that's
 

00:17:24.820 --> 00:17:27.090
research in that area and so that's
something that we're looking at got a

00:17:27.090 --> 00:17:27.100
something that we're looking at got a
 

00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:29.370
something that we're looking at got a
little to add on that actually so just

00:17:29.370 --> 00:17:29.380
little to add on that actually so just
 

00:17:29.380 --> 00:17:31.590
little to add on that actually so just
take one example there's a there was one

00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:31.600
take one example there's a there was one
 

00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:33.540
take one example there's a there was one
of these cross domain solutions that we

00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:33.550
of these cross domain solutions that we
 

00:17:33.550 --> 00:17:35.580
of these cross domain solutions that we
were we were looking to deploy and we

00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:35.590
were we were looking to deploy and we
 

00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:37.590
were we were looking to deploy and we
were trying to get a sense of how how

00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:37.600
were trying to get a sense of how how
 

00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:39.330
were trying to get a sense of how how
much it would take to to administer it

00:17:39.330 --> 00:17:39.340
much it would take to to administer it
 

00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:41.450
much it would take to to administer it
and it turns out they had one already

00:17:41.450 --> 00:17:41.460
and it turns out they had one already
 

00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:43.770
and it turns out they had one already
pulling another location and i'll be

00:17:43.770 --> 00:17:43.780
pulling another location and i'll be
 

00:17:43.780 --> 00:17:47.130
pulling another location and i'll be
staying here on purpose but one specific

00:17:47.130 --> 00:17:47.140
staying here on purpose but one specific
 

00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:49.260
staying here on purpose but one specific
thing i can tell you is that the system

00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:49.270
thing i can tell you is that the system
 

00:17:49.270 --> 00:17:51.120
thing i can tell you is that the system
connected a number of networks together

00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:51.130
connected a number of networks together
 

00:17:51.130 --> 00:17:53.520
connected a number of networks together
into one into one box all these

00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:53.530
into one into one box all these
 

00:17:53.530 --> 00:17:54.930
into one into one box all these
different cables running into it and

00:17:54.930 --> 00:17:54.940
different cables running into it and
 

00:17:54.940 --> 00:17:57.270
different cables running into it and

passwords it turned out once they
finally deployed it that they were what

00:18:05.970 --> 00:18:05.980
finally deployed it that they were what
 

00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:09.210
finally deployed it that they were what
was it like 216 passwords to enter into

00:18:09.210 --> 00:18:09.220
was it like 216 passwords to enter into
 

00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:11.520
was it like 216 passwords to enter into
the system when you start it up and it

00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:11.530
the system when you start it up and it
 

00:18:11.530 --> 00:18:13.260
the system when you start it up and it
took the Appian there were a couple of

00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:13.270
took the Appian there were a couple of
 

00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:15.030
took the Appian there were a couple of
different people required to be there

00:18:15.030 --> 00:18:15.040
different people required to be there
 

00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:16.980
different people required to be there
you know to start it up and it would

00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:16.990
you know to start it up and it would
 

00:18:16.990 --> 00:18:19.520
you know to start it up and it would
take over an hour to start at the system

00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:19.530
take over an hour to start at the system
 

00:18:19.530 --> 00:18:22.050
take over an hour to start at the system
from a cold state so you know you can

00:18:22.050 --> 00:18:22.060
from a cold state so you know you can
 

00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:24.510
from a cold state so you know you can
imagine that the people that were busy

that this would be the result of what
 

00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:31.470

for example recently there's been some

00:46:09.230 --> 00:46:09.240
for example recently there's been some

celebrities that were delivered in
 

00:46:15.240 --> 00:46:17.360
celebrities that were delivered in
hospitals and immediately they're a

bunch of accesses by doctors and nurses

00:46:19.370 --> 00:46:19.380

and other staff and only one of those

these accesses was legitimate so what

00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:25.410
these accesses was legitimate so what
 

00:46:25.410 --> 00:46:27.770
these accesses was legitimate so what
was interesting is through the access

00:46:27.770 --> 00:46:27.780
was interesting is through the access
 

00:46:27.780 --> 00:46:29.720
was interesting is through the access
logs you could exactly tell who made the

00:46:29.720 --> 00:46:29.730
logs you could exactly tell who made the
 

00:46:29.730 --> 00:46:31.190
logs you could exactly tell who made the
accesses and then later on you could

00:46:31.190 --> 00:46:31.200
accesses and then later on you could
 

00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:33.590
accesses and then later on you could
determine which accesses were legitimate

00:46:33.590 --> 00:46:33.600
determine which accesses were legitimate
 

00:46:33.600 --> 00:46:37.130
determine which accesses were legitimate
and which ones weren't so the the staff

00:46:37.130 --> 00:46:37.140
and which ones weren't so the the staff
 

00:46:37.140 --> 00:46:38.840

that made the illegitimate accesses they

then I will face with with with some

00:46:42.350 --> 00:46:42.360
then I will face with with with some
 

00:46:42.360 --> 00:46:44.840
then I will face with with with some
detentions so essentially looking at

00:46:44.840 --> 00:46:44.850

00:46:44.850 --> 00:46:49.130
detentions so essentially looking at
this as an example gives us a way to

this as an example gives us a way to

this as an example gives us a way to
deal with these issues in the future as

00:46:52.190 --> 00:46:52.200
deal with these issues in the future as
 

00:46:52.200 --> 00:46:55.310
deal with these issues in the future as
well so such tracing for example it can

00:46:55.310 --> 00:46:55.320
well so such tracing for example it can
 

00:46:55.320 --> 00:46:58.550
well so such tracing for example it can
help you in providing a deterrent for

00:46:58.550 --> 00:46:58.560
help you in providing a deterrent for
 

00:46:58.560 --> 00:47:01.610
help you in providing a deterrent for
illegitimate accesses so just to take a

00:47:01.610 --> 00:47:01.620
illegitimate accesses so just to take a
 

00:47:01.620 --> 00:47:03.410
illegitimate accesses so just to take a
concrete example it's in future homes

00:47:03.410 --> 00:47:03.420
concrete example it's in future homes

you have a door lock that can be opened

00:47:06.200 --> 00:47:06.210
you have a door lock that can be opened
 

00:47:06.210 --> 00:47:09.560
you have a door lock that can be opened
by any medical staff if you have if they

00:47:09.560 --> 00:47:09.570
by any medical staff if you have if they
 

00:47:09.570 --> 00:47:10.910
by any medical staff if you have if they
have reason to believe that there was

00:47:10.910 --> 00:47:10.920
have reason to believe that there was
 

00:47:10.920 --> 00:47:13.130
have reason to believe that there was
some emergency so for example you face a

00:47:13.130 --> 00:47:13.140
some emergency so for example you face a
 

00:47:13.140 --> 00:47:15.440
some emergency so for example you face a
heart attack or somebody dialed 911 they

00:47:15.440 --> 00:47:15.450
heart attack or somebody dialed 911 they
 

00:47:15.450 --> 00:47:18.050
heart attack or somebody dialed 911 they
can actually come and open your door

00:47:18.050 --> 00:47:18.060
can actually come and open your door
 

00:47:18.060 --> 00:47:21.770
can actually come and open your door
lock in the home and later on if if

00:47:21.770 --> 00:47:21.780
lock in the home and later on if if
 

00:47:21.780 --> 00:47:24.710

there's been an illegitimate intrusion

00:47:24.710 --> 00:47:24.720
there's been an illegitimate intrusion
 

00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:26.090
there's been an illegitimate intrusion
you could later go back and say well

00:47:26.090 --> 00:47:26.100
you could later go back and say well
 

00:47:26.100 --> 00:47:28.160
you could later go back and say well
it's this person who open it and the

00:47:28.160 --> 00:47:28.170
it's this person who open it and the
 

00:47:28.170 --> 00:47:30.740
it's this person who open it and the
access was illegitimate so that's one of

00:47:30.740 --> 00:47:30.750
access was illegitimate so that's one of
 

00:47:30.750 --> 00:47:33.380
access was illegitimate so that's one of
the promising directions to go in but of

00:47:33.380 --> 00:47:33.390
the promising directions to go in but of
 

00:47:33.390 --> 00:47:35.770
the promising directions to go in but of
course there's a lot of privacy and

00:47:35.770 --> 00:47:35.780
course there's a lot of privacy and
 

00:47:35.780 --> 00:47:39.110
course there's a lot of privacy and
issues that come up in this context if

00:47:39.110 --> 00:47:39.120
issues that come up in this context if
 

00:47:39.120 --> 00:47:41.270
issues that come up in this context if
you log a lot of these accesses but

00:47:41.270 --> 00:47:41.280
you log a lot of these accesses but
 

00:47:41.280 --> 00:47:42.650
you log a lot of these accesses but
again

00:47:42.650 --> 00:47:42.660
again
 

00:47:42.660 --> 00:47:45.090

deterrence can be a very powerful force

00:47:45.090 --> 00:47:45.100
deterrence can be a very powerful force
 

00:47:45.100 --> 00:47:46.770
deterrence can be a very powerful force
against such access is especially in the

00:47:46.770 --> 00:47:46.780
against such access is especially in the
 

00:47:46.780 --> 00:47:51.000
against such access is especially in the
medical field and I think there that's

00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:51.010
medical field and I think there that's
 

00:47:51.010 --> 00:47:53.940
medical field and I think there that's
one of the best ways for handling

00:47:53.940 --> 00:47:53.950
one of the best ways for handling
 

00:47:53.950 --> 00:47:57.750
one of the best ways for handling
privacy medical areas i believe so let

00:47:57.750 --> 00:47:57.760
privacy medical areas i believe so let
 

00:47:57.760 --> 00:47:59.100
privacy medical areas i believe so let
me understand that so i think the

00:47:59.100 --> 00:47:59.110
me understand that so i think the
 

00:47:59.110 --> 00:48:00.450
me understand that so i think the
question was what are the next

00:48:00.450 --> 00:48:00.460
question was what are the next
 

00:48:00.460 --> 00:48:02.910
question was what are the next
generation protocols and i think so i

00:48:02.910 --> 00:48:02.920
generation protocols and i think so i
 

00:48:02.920 --> 00:48:05.490
generation protocols and i think so i
read that as technical protocols like

00:48:05.490 --> 00:48:05.500
read that as technical protocols like
 

00:48:05.500 --> 00:48:09.690
read that as technical protocols like
TCP IP or standards like HTML but I

00:48:09.690 --> 00:48:09.700
TCP IP or standards like HTML but I
 

00:48:09.700 --> 00:48:11.340
TCP IP or standards like HTML but I
think what you're suggesting is that

00:48:11.340 --> 00:48:11.350
think what you're suggesting is that
 

00:48:11.350 --> 00:48:13.410
think what you're suggesting is that
infrastructure is going to pretty much

00:48:13.410 --> 00:48:13.420
infrastructure is going to pretty much
 

00:48:13.420 --> 00:48:15.420
infrastructure is going to pretty much
remain the same and there have to be a

00:48:15.430 --> 00:48:17.640

layer of protocols above that which are

layer of protocols above that which are
 

00:48:17.650 --> 00:48:20.040

00:48:20.050 --> 00:48:23.760
behavioral policy-oriented protocols

didn't come to my consensus is what's
 

00:48:41.620 --> 00:48:43.860
didn't come to my consensus is what's
the right way in who we give access to

not to be a technical problem hope this
part be okay go for it

00:49:26.680 --> 00:49:29.020
 
right but to me that's working out the

00:49:29.020 --> 00:49:29.030
right but to me that's working out the
 

00:49:29.030 --> 00:49:30.430
right but to me that's working out the
policy right because everything you're

00:49:30.430 --> 00:49:30.440
policy right because everything you're
 

00:49:30.440 --> 00:49:32.080

kind of talking about you're trying to

kind of talking about you're trying to
enable some use case do we have

00:49:33.910 --> 00:49:33.920
enable some use case do we have
 

00:49:33.920 --> 00:49:35.800
enable some use case do we have
consensus on all the use cases you know

00:49:35.800 --> 00:49:35.810
consensus on all the use cases you know
 

00:49:35.810 --> 00:49:43.290

we want and how would we enable them
