00:00:00.276 --> 00:00:01.354
- Hey everyone, it's Mark Wiens.

00:00:01.354 --> 00:00:02.723
I am in Quezon City,

00:00:02.723 --> 00:00:05.199
which is right next to
Manila in the Philippines

00:00:05.199 --> 00:00:06.685
and I'm at a restaurant today for lunch

00:00:06.685 --> 00:00:08.972
which is called Pochok Bangusan

00:00:08.972 --> 00:00:11.700
and this is a restaurant,
this is a carinderia,

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.778
which is a local, food house eatery.

00:00:13.778 --> 00:00:17.076
It's a family-run restaurant,
it's a friendly place to eat

00:00:17.076 --> 00:00:20.416
and they serve some amazing
looking Filipino food here

00:00:20.416 --> 00:00:23.345
and especially on of their
main dishes is the bangus,

00:00:23.345 --> 00:00:24.928
which is a milkfish

00:00:26.202 --> 00:00:29.173
and it looks absolutely stunning.

00:00:29.173 --> 00:00:31.756
(upbeat music)

00:00:40.097 --> 00:00:43.449
(speaking Filipino)

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:44.675
- [Mark] This is adobo?

00:00:44.675 --> 00:00:45.508
- [Server] Yeah.

00:00:45.508 --> 00:00:46.508
- [Mark] OK.

00:00:53.175 --> 00:00:54.175
- [Mark] OK.

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.056
Ohh, what is this on top?

00:01:11.056 --> 00:01:13.970
- [Server] (speaking Filipino)

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.953
- [Mark] Ohh! (speaking Filipino)

00:01:17.953 --> 00:01:19.805
- [Server] (speaking Filipino)

00:01:19.805 --> 00:01:22.108
- Along with a huge selection
of local Filipino food,

00:01:22.108 --> 00:01:23.952
that you can pick and choose from,

00:01:23.952 --> 00:01:25.809
one of the things that you have to order,

00:01:25.809 --> 00:01:30.351
when you eat at Pochok Bangusan
is their special bangus.

00:01:30.351 --> 00:01:31.742
Bangus, which is a milkfish,

00:01:31.742 --> 00:01:34.434
is grilled on an insanely hot fire

00:01:34.434 --> 00:01:38.360
and the charcoal is even
fanned to keep it flaming hot.

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.891
After the milkfish is
grilled, it's flipped over

00:01:40.891 --> 00:01:43.572
and to finish it off, it's
topped in a thick layer

00:01:43.572 --> 00:01:45.175
of green tomato relish.

00:01:45.175 --> 00:01:47.079
It's an absolute stunner of a dish,

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:48.669
that you don't want to miss.

00:01:48.669 --> 00:01:50.002
Pochok Bangusan.

00:01:50.949 --> 00:01:51.782
Pochcok?

00:01:51.782 --> 00:01:53.348
- [Woman] Pochok Bangusan.

00:01:53.348 --> 00:01:54.283
- Pochok Bangusan.

00:01:54.283 --> 00:01:55.116
- [Woman] Yes, sir.

00:01:55.116 --> 00:01:55.972
- OK, thank you.

00:01:55.972 --> 00:01:58.317
This local restaurant is in Quezon City,

00:01:58.317 --> 00:02:00.993
so it's a little drive from central,

00:02:00.993 --> 00:02:03.743
from the downtown area of Manila,

00:02:04.632 --> 00:02:06.952
but it looks like the food
is gonna be well worth it.

00:02:06.952 --> 00:02:08.917
I think it's about 11 a.m. right now,

00:02:08.917 --> 00:02:11.808
so most of the dishes are
freshly prepared for lunch.

00:02:11.808 --> 00:02:14.969
This is one of the best
times to come eat here

00:02:14.969 --> 00:02:17.497
and the food looks, you know,
the dishes are full too,

00:02:17.497 --> 00:02:19.997
so the, I think they're about
to get a big lunch rush,

00:02:19.997 --> 00:02:21.688
but we got here before the rush,

00:02:21.688 --> 00:02:24.196
but when the food is already made,

00:02:24.196 --> 00:02:26.065
I have to begin with their signature dish,

00:02:26.065 --> 00:02:27.863
which is the bangus.

00:02:27.863 --> 00:02:30.512
Bangus is one of my
favorite Filipino foods,

00:02:30.512 --> 00:02:31.900
it's something I love to eat,

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.797
when I come to the Philippines.

00:02:33.797 --> 00:02:35.702
First of all, I really love fish

00:02:35.702 --> 00:02:39.300
and then milkfish has this
unique texture and taste

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.115
and so they've grilled the fish,

00:02:41.115 --> 00:02:43.654
just topped it with a bunch of wonderful,

00:02:43.654 --> 00:02:46.290
I think it's green, mostly green tomato.

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.088
There's onion on here and there looks like

00:02:49.088 --> 00:02:50.788
there's some green onions as well,

00:02:50.788 --> 00:02:53.406
but I think most of that is green tomato.

00:02:53.406 --> 00:02:54.869
You can see those grill marks.

00:02:54.869 --> 00:02:57.336
You can actually smell
the grill on it as well.

00:02:57.336 --> 00:03:00.529
You can smell that charcoal
aroma coming off of it.

00:03:00.529 --> 00:03:02.143
Get a really close up look at that.

00:03:02.143 --> 00:03:04.230
That looks delicious

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.480
and I'm just going for a straight bite.

00:03:12.414 --> 00:03:14.247
Oh, that is good, mmm.

00:03:16.097 --> 00:03:18.202
The texture of the milkfish,

00:03:18.202 --> 00:03:19.763
I don't know if it's in my mind or not,

00:03:19.763 --> 00:03:23.738
but you can almost taste like a milky,

00:03:23.738 --> 00:03:28.005
juices coming out of
it, but it's a dry fish,

00:03:28.005 --> 00:03:31.188
so it has, similar to, if
I could compare it to tuna,

00:03:31.188 --> 00:03:35.332
it has that kind of dry naturalness to it.

00:03:35.332 --> 00:03:39.600
But it has an amazing smoky
flavor, as I could smell

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.799
and then you've got that topping.

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:44.743
It's really good , it's
like a sour, tomatoey...

00:03:44.743 --> 00:03:47.581
but it's not sweet at
all, it's mostly all sour

00:03:47.581 --> 00:03:50.414
and gives it a really fresh,

00:03:50.414 --> 00:03:52.132
freshness with those onions as well.

00:03:52.132 --> 00:03:53.474
Another signature dish they have here,

00:03:53.474 --> 00:03:54.593
which is called bulalo

00:03:54.593 --> 00:03:57.176
and this is a bone-marrow soup.

00:03:58.596 --> 00:04:01.525
What this soup is known
for is being a combination

00:04:01.525 --> 00:04:04.508
of the broth and then
they boil it for so long,

00:04:04.508 --> 00:04:07.155
so the marrow gets released into the soup,

00:04:07.155 --> 00:04:10.405
so you've got kind of a marrowy liquid,

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:16.047
that should be rich and
flavorful and beefy.

00:04:17.598 --> 00:04:20.749
It has like a, almost like
a slippery feel to it,

00:04:20.749 --> 00:04:22.582
because it's a little bit oily,

00:04:22.582 --> 00:04:24.013
but what I like about it is,

00:04:24.013 --> 00:04:25.905
it's definitely not too salty at all.

00:04:25.905 --> 00:04:28.587
They've really controlled the saltiness,

00:04:28.587 --> 00:04:29.688
so it's not too salty.

00:04:29.688 --> 00:04:32.883
It is very rich and then
you've also got the contrast

00:04:32.883 --> 00:04:36.006
of the real beefy flavor,
yet at the same time,

00:04:36.006 --> 00:04:39.231
it's broken down by the
vegetables and cabbage.

00:04:39.231 --> 00:04:42.926
When you boil cabbage in a
soup, it usually gives the soup

00:04:42.926 --> 00:04:46.235
kind of a little bit of
a natural sweetness to it

00:04:46.235 --> 00:04:50.402
and that sort of breaks
the oiliness of that broth.

00:04:54.876 --> 00:04:57.683
Oh the meat, the meat is so tender.

00:04:57.683 --> 00:04:59.319
Next up, this is an eggplant dish

00:04:59.319 --> 00:05:02.105
and it is a whole
eggplant, which is roasted.

00:05:02.105 --> 00:05:04.435
So first they have a separate
pan of just the eggplant

00:05:04.435 --> 00:05:05.783
and then as soon as I ordered it,

00:05:05.783 --> 00:05:07.806
she put it onto a plate
and then she topped it

00:05:07.806 --> 00:05:11.973
with what I think are little
diced slices of green mango

00:05:13.425 --> 00:05:17.175
and then also what I think is
some peppered shrimp paste.

00:05:17.175 --> 00:05:18.998
I'm gonna ask them what
the name of this dish is.

00:05:18.998 --> 00:05:21.285
What is the name of this dish?

00:05:21.285 --> 00:05:24.736
- [Woman] (speaking Filipino) Alamang.

00:05:24.736 --> 00:05:25.860
- Alamang.

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:28.171
- [Woman] Yes, shrimp, salt. (laughs)

00:05:28.171 --> 00:05:29.004
- Shrimp, is it bago--

00:05:29.004 --> 00:05:29.937
- [Woman] Shrimp, salt.

00:05:29.937 --> 00:05:31.028
- Bagoo, bagoong?

00:05:31.028 --> 00:05:32.585
- [Woman] Bagoon alamang.

00:05:32.585 --> 00:05:35.071
- Alamang, bagoon alamang, thank you.

00:05:35.071 --> 00:05:37.960
Eggplant is just such a
wonderful thing to be roasted,

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:40.570
so I'm gonna, I'm going
right in for the center here.

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:42.820
Oh yeah, it's soft, it's...

00:05:44.502 --> 00:05:47.003
Ohhh (laughs) it just slides,
my spoon just slides through,

00:05:47.003 --> 00:05:47.836
like it's butter

00:05:47.836 --> 00:05:49.141
and you've got the shrimp paste there,

00:05:49.141 --> 00:05:52.218
you've got the green mango there

00:05:52.218 --> 00:05:54.267
and I'm not sure if that is a sauce

00:05:54.267 --> 00:05:57.273
or if that's just the gooey liquid,

00:05:57.273 --> 00:05:59.060
that comes as a result of when you,

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:01.931
when you grill up, when
you roast eggplant.

00:06:01.931 --> 00:06:05.514
Oh that looks wonderful,
it's like a glaze.

00:06:09.679 --> 00:06:10.870
I might have taken a little too much

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:12.449
of the shrimp paste in that bite,

00:06:12.449 --> 00:06:15.165
but I did manage to get
the full range of taste,

00:06:15.165 --> 00:06:17.151
tastes in that single bite.

00:06:17.151 --> 00:06:20.343
Again, that eggplant is
just so buttery-creamy

00:06:20.343 --> 00:06:22.031
and then it has a roasted flavor

00:06:22.031 --> 00:06:25.763
and then you've got that
salty, shrimpy taste

00:06:25.763 --> 00:06:28.158
of that fermented shrimp paste

00:06:28.158 --> 00:06:31.501
and then that's contrasted
by the sour crispiness

00:06:31.501 --> 00:06:32.584
of the mango.

00:06:33.637 --> 00:06:36.249
Wow, what a wonderful contrast of flavors.

00:06:36.249 --> 00:06:38.258
Just for my next bite, I'm gonna add

00:06:38.258 --> 00:06:39.275
a little less of the shrimp paste,

00:06:39.275 --> 00:06:42.010
'cause that, if you take
too much in one bite,

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:44.329
your mouth will just
be coated in saltiness.

00:06:44.329 --> 00:06:46.837
Adobo is one of the national
dishes of the Philippines,

00:06:46.837 --> 00:06:48.461
one of the most famous foods.

00:06:48.461 --> 00:06:51.387
This is adobo with, is it mostly liver,

00:06:51.387 --> 00:06:53.073
but also gizzards in here too, right?

00:06:53.073 --> 00:06:54.195
Is it all liver?

00:06:54.195 --> 00:06:56.746
It's like innards, chicken innards adobo.

00:06:56.746 --> 00:07:00.033
There's liver here, there's
gizzard, this is a gizzard,

00:07:00.033 --> 00:07:01.866
I'm going for a liver.

00:07:03.039 --> 00:07:04.815
Oh, and a heart, ohh!

00:07:04.815 --> 00:07:07.348
Oh, the heart is still
connected to the liver.

00:07:07.348 --> 00:07:08.559
Is that a heart, right?

00:07:08.559 --> 00:07:09.828
That's a heart, right Ying?

00:07:09.828 --> 00:07:11.860
Oh, this is the bonus
piece, heart and liver.

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:14.610
I'd better put this onto my rice.

00:07:18.064 --> 00:07:20.916
I haven't even started on my rice yet.

00:07:20.916 --> 00:07:23.800
OK, I'm gonna cut half this liver

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:27.640
and then add a little more
of that oily adobo sauce

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:32.281
and I'm going for a liver
and heart bite all in one.

00:07:32.281 --> 00:07:34.114
Oh, double the organs.

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:39.935
Oh that is so tender and so creamy

00:07:39.935 --> 00:07:44.102
and you know how liver has
that really, really creamy,

00:07:45.311 --> 00:07:48.131
really soft, almost like dry

00:07:48.131 --> 00:07:50.634
and sometimes a little chalky consistency,

00:07:50.634 --> 00:07:52.218
but then the heart has more of a,

00:07:52.218 --> 00:07:55.577
a bouncy texture, like a hotdog,

00:07:55.577 --> 00:07:59.033
but in the utmost, utmost
natural kind of way.

00:07:59.033 --> 00:08:01.565
So that's like having a creamy
liver with a bouncy heart,

00:08:01.565 --> 00:08:03.561
all in one bite.

00:08:03.561 --> 00:08:05.872
Moving to the front here, this is menudo

00:08:05.872 --> 00:08:09.750
and this is, this is a
dish, menudo is a dish,

00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:11.294
that is also very popular in Mexico.

00:08:11.294 --> 00:08:13.756
Normally, when I've had menudo though,

00:08:13.756 --> 00:08:17.946
it's normally the stomach,
so I guess this is the,

00:08:17.946 --> 00:08:22.497
maybe it's the, this is
mostly pork meat in here,

00:08:22.497 --> 00:08:24.747
but it's, it's like a stew.

00:08:28.232 --> 00:08:31.602
That tastes exactly like a tomatoey,

00:08:31.602 --> 00:08:34.293
kind of a little bit
tart like a tomatoey stew

00:08:34.293 --> 00:08:37.188
and then the final dish that
Ying and I ordered right now

00:08:37.188 --> 00:08:39.841
is grilled pork and
actually we just got this,

00:08:39.841 --> 00:08:41.986
because it looked good and it was fresh

00:08:41.986 --> 00:08:44.169
and it smelled so good
that we couldn't resist.

00:08:44.169 --> 00:08:47.834
So grilled pork right off the grill.

00:08:47.834 --> 00:08:49.556
You can see those char marks on it.

00:08:49.556 --> 00:08:51.346
Something that I love about Filipino food

00:08:51.346 --> 00:08:53.840
is when they grill, you can
just see those char marks,

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:56.893
so you know it has an incredibly charcoal,

00:08:56.893 --> 00:08:59.442
roasted, fire flavor to it

00:08:59.442 --> 00:09:02.406
and that, yeah, the grilled
dishes here are so good.

00:09:02.406 --> 00:09:06.489
Mix this with a little
rice and some adobo sauce.

00:09:07.977 --> 00:09:10.094
That chargrilled flavor is undeniable

00:09:10.094 --> 00:09:13.298
and the pork has a little
bit of, some texture to it.

00:09:13.298 --> 00:09:17.428
It's not too, not too soft,
but it tastes like real pork,

00:09:17.428 --> 00:09:19.077
real pig here.

00:09:19.077 --> 00:09:21.660
(upbeat music)

00:09:25.489 --> 00:09:27.085
Oh different bowl?

00:09:27.085 --> 00:09:29.011
OK, but put it together.

00:09:29.011 --> 00:09:30.502
(speaks Filipino)

00:09:30.502 --> 00:09:33.085
(upbeat music)

00:09:39.269 --> 00:09:40.413
I didn't realize this at first,

00:09:40.413 --> 00:09:42.166
but I knew they had to have some chilies

00:09:42.166 --> 00:09:45.206
and some condiments, so
after trying all the food,

00:09:45.206 --> 00:09:46.831
I went over there and
I was talking to them

00:09:46.831 --> 00:09:48.203
and they showed me where the condiments,

00:09:48.203 --> 00:09:49.747
all the condiments are self-serve.

00:09:49.747 --> 00:09:52.859
I'm always happy to have
more chilies in any meal.

00:09:52.859 --> 00:09:54.171
For the sauce, do you normally,

00:09:54.171 --> 00:09:56.609
do you normally mix the--
- This is anchovy paste.

00:09:56.609 --> 00:09:57.729
- The shrimp paste, or anchovy?

00:09:57.729 --> 00:09:58.696
- [Woman] Anchovies.

00:09:58.696 --> 00:09:59.894
- Oh, anchovy.
- Yeah.

00:09:59.894 --> 00:10:01.894
- Ohh, OK, so it's fish.

00:10:02.929 --> 00:10:04.533
- Fish, fishoes, fishoes.

00:10:04.533 --> 00:10:06.004
- OK, and do you mix--

00:10:06.004 --> 00:10:07.092
- (speaking Filipino) Chilie.

00:10:07.092 --> 00:10:09.092
- [Mark] OK, then eat with the bangus?

00:10:09.092 --> 00:10:10.362
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:10:10.362 --> 00:10:11.311
- OK, thank you.

00:10:11.311 --> 00:10:13.193
OK, squeeze in the calamansi.

00:10:13.193 --> 00:10:17.360
- [Woman] (speaking in
Filipino) calamansi.

00:10:19.314 --> 00:10:21.206
- Oh, OK, you can dip in it also?

00:10:21.206 --> 00:10:22.039
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:10:22.039 --> 00:10:24.461
- OK, and what about this sauce?

00:10:24.461 --> 00:10:26.638
- Fish (speaking in Filipino)
and soya sauce, lovely.

00:10:26.638 --> 00:10:27.524
- Oh, soya sauce, just soya sauce?

00:10:27.524 --> 00:10:28.535
- [Woman] Yes.

00:10:28.535 --> 00:10:30.118
- And then chilies.

00:10:32.351 --> 00:10:35.055
I'll just break these up in here.

00:10:35.055 --> 00:10:38.135
Moving over to this fish here.

00:10:38.135 --> 00:10:42.302
That addition of that green
tomato on top is just brilliant.

00:10:43.166 --> 00:10:45.416
Goes onto my rice and move over here,

00:10:45.416 --> 00:10:48.583
add some of this sauce and that chili.

00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:56.827
Oh yeah, OK, that is anchovy sauce.

00:10:58.988 --> 00:11:01.099
Ohh, oh, I know that flavor very well.

00:11:01.099 --> 00:11:05.423
Very sharply salty, fermented fish flavor,

00:11:05.423 --> 00:11:07.698
oh and with that chili,
and then contrasting

00:11:07.698 --> 00:11:10.812
with the fish and then sour tomato,

00:11:10.812 --> 00:11:13.039
oh, there's celery on here too.

00:11:13.039 --> 00:11:15.023
Oh, that's awesomely good.

00:11:15.023 --> 00:11:17.102
Oh, you have to eat this,
when you come to Manila

00:11:17.102 --> 00:11:18.287
and this time, I'm gonna go

00:11:18.287 --> 00:11:21.204
for a little bit of the soya sauce.

00:11:22.575 --> 00:11:23.859
A little soya sauce on there

00:11:23.859 --> 00:11:26.859
and then I'll chase it with a chili.

00:11:30.311 --> 00:11:32.561
I chased it with the chili.

00:11:35.086 --> 00:11:36.698
That's a brilliant combination as well.

00:11:36.698 --> 00:11:38.743
I think that's just straight soya sauce,

00:11:38.743 --> 00:11:40.308
so you got just that.

00:11:40.308 --> 00:11:43.321
It doesn't have that
fermented flavor to it

00:11:43.321 --> 00:11:46.045
and the chilies are a little bit spicy,

00:11:46.045 --> 00:11:47.957
but they feel wonderful.

00:11:47.957 --> 00:11:49.656
Oh, I love it.

00:11:49.656 --> 00:11:51.293
Ohhh (laughs) wow!

00:11:51.293 --> 00:11:53.710
OK thank you, thank you very.

00:11:55.071 --> 00:11:57.506
Thank you very much, what
is it, what is it called?

00:11:57.506 --> 00:11:58.442
- Lechon kawali.

00:11:58.442 --> 00:11:59.275
- Lechon kawali?

00:11:59.275 --> 00:12:00.108
- [Woman] Yes.

00:12:00.108 --> 00:12:04.275
Wow, and this is another one
of their famous dishes here.

00:12:07.270 --> 00:12:09.937
That is just ridiculously creamy

00:12:12.078 --> 00:12:15.411
and fatty and crunchy, all the textures.

00:12:19.294 --> 00:12:20.595
Those chilies went down so well,

00:12:20.595 --> 00:12:22.129
that I had to get more chilies.

00:12:22.129 --> 00:12:24.254
And then I've already
eaten some of the beef,

00:12:24.254 --> 00:12:27.400
but there's still a whole chunk of beef

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:28.945
attached to the bone.

00:12:28.945 --> 00:12:32.859
Ohh (laughs) look at this.

00:12:32.859 --> 00:12:36.692
I'm gonna, maybe I should
just bite from here.

00:12:42.684 --> 00:12:43.517
Oh yeah!

00:12:44.717 --> 00:12:46.310
That is some real beef.

00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:49.393
It's tender, it's a little bit fatty.

00:12:53.059 --> 00:12:53.892
- 740.

00:12:58.545 --> 00:13:00.161
- Just finished with that meal

00:13:00.161 --> 00:13:02.863
and you can actually come
out here and buy ice cream

00:13:02.863 --> 00:13:04.624
right on the sidewalk, right
outside of the restaurant.

00:13:04.624 --> 00:13:06.793
The restaurant is packed right now,

00:13:06.793 --> 00:13:07.777
lots and lots of people

00:13:07.777 --> 00:13:10.970
and they are just smoking
out this entire area,

00:13:10.970 --> 00:13:13.617
it's just smoky because
all of the bungus grilling,

00:13:13.617 --> 00:13:15.509
the milkfish grilling on the grill,

00:13:15.509 --> 00:13:18.563
just that smoke is filling
this entire neighborhood.

00:13:18.563 --> 00:13:22.778
The, everything was delicious,
but that grilled milkfish,

00:13:22.778 --> 00:13:25.279
that was just next
level, unbelievably good.

00:13:25.279 --> 00:13:26.643
That's something you have to order,

00:13:26.643 --> 00:13:28.202
that's a Filipino food you have to order,

00:13:28.202 --> 00:13:30.952
when you come to this restaurant,

00:13:32.015 --> 00:13:33.238
but the, I love everything
about his place.

00:13:33.238 --> 00:13:35.699
It's friendly, the owners are very nice,

00:13:35.699 --> 00:13:37.753
the food is delicious, the atmosphere.

00:13:37.753 --> 00:13:41.683
They have both a few tables
out in the front patio area

00:13:41.683 --> 00:13:44.429
and then they have some
tables on the inside as well,

00:13:44.429 --> 00:13:48.399
but a fantastic, local
restaurant in Quezon City.

00:13:48.399 --> 00:13:51.843
I loved it and I hope
you enjoyed this video.
