just so we don't jiggle the hdmi because

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280
just so we don't jiggle the hdmi because
 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:15.670
just so we don't jiggle the hdmi because
because it's yep

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680
because it's yep
 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.110
because it's yep
oh that's funny I put it down in an

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:17.120
oh that's funny I put it down in an
 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.729
oh that's funny I put it down in an
angle and then I looked at this and I

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:18.739
angle and then I looked at this and I
 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:21.310
angle and then I looked at this and I
thought oh no how wait how is that an

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:21.320
thought oh no how wait how is that an
 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.409
thought oh no how wait how is that an
angle that's just the way it works so

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:23.419
angle that's just the way it works so
 

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:28.480
angle that's just the way it works so
yeah so prolix is kind of a it's a

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:28.490
yeah so prolix is kind of a it's a
 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:31.240
yeah so prolix is kind of a it's a
slight twist on your typical bubble

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:31.250
slight twist on your typical bubble
 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:32.980
slight twist on your typical bubble
popping game yeah actually I think it's

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:32.990
popping game yeah actually I think it's
 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:34.360
popping game yeah actually I think it's
pretty pretty significant sweet twist

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:34.370
pretty pretty significant sweet twist
 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:35.890
pretty pretty significant sweet twist
you know we're basically what you have

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:35.900
you know we're basically what you have
 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:40.330
you know we're basically what you have
to do is create sequences of paths that

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:40.340
to do is create sequences of paths that
 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:43.120
to do is create sequences of paths that
that have to cover all the dots you can

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:43.130
that have to cover all the dots you can
 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:47.499
that have to cover all the dots you can
all of the the pearls that are the same

00:04:47.499 --> 00:04:47.509
all of the the pearls that are the same
 

00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:49.600
all of the the pearls that are the same
color that are touching each other but

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:49.610
color that are touching each other but
 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:52.390
color that are touching each other but
also have to be in a line that goes

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:52.400
also have to be in a line that goes
 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.300
also have to be in a line that goes
straight through without any turns or

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:55.310
straight through without any turns or
 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:57.999
straight through without any turns or
diagonals so like it's impossible to

00:04:57.999 --> 00:04:58.009
diagonals so like it's impossible to
 

00:04:58.009 --> 00:04:59.560
diagonals so like it's impossible to
pick up oh well without any backtracking

00:04:59.560 --> 00:04:59.570
pick up oh well without any backtracking
 

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:01.779
pick up oh well without any backtracking
yeah so for instance this hon look you

00:05:01.779 --> 00:05:01.789
yeah so for instance this hon look you
 

00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:04.749
yeah so for instance this hon look you
can't do can we cello in there then they

00:05:04.749 --> 00:05:04.759
can't do can we cello in there then they
 

00:05:04.759 --> 00:05:06.400
can't do can we cello in there then they
have really really cute sound effects

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:06.410
have really really cute sound effects
 

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:07.570
have really really cute sound effects
what we can't play because of the man

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:07.580
what we can't play because of the man
 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:10.240
what we can't play because of the man
yeah all right exactly oh it's a big one

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:10.250
yeah all right exactly oh it's a big one
 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:13.930
yeah all right exactly oh it's a big one
over there on that there is oh oh yeah

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:13.940
over there on that there is oh oh yeah
 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:17.170
over there on that there is oh oh yeah
nice okay yeah so what I like about this

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:17.180
nice okay yeah so what I like about this
 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:20.860
nice okay yeah so what I like about this
twist is that it's not just a change in

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:20.870
twist is that it's not just a change in
 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:23.310
twist is that it's not just a change in
the way it's you know played from

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:23.320
the way it's you know played from
 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:25.810
the way it's you know played from
mechanics level it does affect your

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:25.820
mechanics level it does affect your
 

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:29.219
mechanics level it does affect your
strategy deeply yeah absolutely and it's

00:05:29.219 --> 00:05:29.229
strategy deeply yeah absolutely and it's
 

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:31.750
strategy deeply yeah absolutely and it's
you can definitely screw yourself up and

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:31.760
you can definitely screw yourself up and
 

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:33.580
you can definitely screw yourself up and
get to a point where there's just

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:33.590
get to a point where there's just
 

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:35.860
get to a point where there's just
nothing you can pop anymore if you're

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:35.870
nothing you can pop anymore if you're
 

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:37.240
nothing you can pop anymore if you're
not careful also there's a timer

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:37.250
not careful also there's a timer
 

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:39.520
not careful also there's a timer
throughout the game as we just saw so

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:39.530
throughout the game as we just saw so
 

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:40.870
throughout the game as we just saw so
you know just some general comments

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:40.880
you know just some general comments
 

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:42.339
you know just some general comments
about the game 1 this is a you know

00:05:42.339 --> 00:05:42.349
about the game 1 this is a you know
 

00:05:42.349 --> 00:05:44.050
about the game 1 this is a you know
example of what happens when you don't

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:44.060
example of what happens when you don't
 

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:45.999
example of what happens when you don't
actually look at the ad on a tablet

00:05:45.999 --> 00:05:46.009
actually look at the ad on a tablet
 

00:05:46.009 --> 00:05:49.240
actually look at the ad on a tablet
device yeah yeah your ad network is

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:49.250
device yeah yeah your ad network is
 

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:50.770
device yeah yeah your ad network is
probably not going to be happy with you

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:50.780
probably not going to be happy with you
 

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:53.050
probably not going to be happy with you
for that why I think it's more of it you

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:53.060
for that why I think it's more of it you
 

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:54.490
for that why I think it's more of it you
probably people aren't even know what

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:54.500
probably people aren't even know what
 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:55.810
probably people aren't even know what
that is and maybe they'll get some

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:55.820
that is and maybe they'll get some
 

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:56.950
that is and maybe they'll get some
clicks that way i don't know but i

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:56.960
clicks that way i don't know but i
 

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:58.659
clicks that way i don't know but i
suspect to get fewer clicks if people

00:05:58.659 --> 00:05:58.669
suspect to get fewer clicks if people
 

00:05:58.669 --> 00:06:00.010
suspect to get fewer clicks if people
can't read the ad but you know you never

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:00.020
can't read the ad but you know you never

yeah i never know what really works with
 

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:03.790
yeah i never know what really works with
these things yeah that's definitely one

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:03.800
these things yeah that's definitely one
 

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:06.159
these things yeah that's definitely one
thing to look at now what is the share

00:06:06.159 --> 00:06:06.169
thing to look at now what is the share
 

00:06:06.169 --> 00:06:08.439
thing to look at now what is the share
button do I didn't actually try it I'm a

00:06:08.439 --> 00:06:08.449
button do I didn't actually try it I'm a
 

00:06:08.449 --> 00:06:09.760
button do I didn't actually try it I'm a
little bit terrified well that is a

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:09.770
little bit terrified well that is a
 

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:11.740
little bit terrified well that is a
share in time Charenton that's good um

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:11.750
share in time Charenton that's good um
 

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:14.730
share in time Charenton that's good um
but you've also got a facebook button

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:14.740
but you've also got a facebook button
 

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:18.330
but you've also got a facebook button
which takes you to the website yeah

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:18.340
which takes you to the website yeah
 

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:20.290
which takes you to the website yeah
we're not super thrilled with that and

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:20.300
we're not super thrilled with that and
 

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:21.700
we're not super thrilled with that and
then let me be really clear it has

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:21.710
then let me be really clear it has
 

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:24.940
then let me be really clear it has
nothing to do with the particular social

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:24.950
nothing to do with the particular social
 

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:27.760
nothing to do with the particular social
network if this was a google plus button

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:27.770
network if this was a google plus button
 

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:30.580
network if this was a google plus button
we would feel exactly the same way it's

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:30.590
we would feel exactly the same way it's
 

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:34.680
we would feel exactly the same way it's
just there's already a share intent and

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:34.690
just there's already a share intent and
 

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:37.749
just there's already a share intent and
adding extra stuff on there especially

00:06:37.749 --> 00:06:37.759
adding extra stuff on there especially
 

00:06:37.759 --> 00:06:38.950
adding extra stuff on there especially
something that's going to take you out

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:38.960
something that's going to take you out
 

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:40.839
something that's going to take you out
of the game and launch a web browser

00:06:40.839 --> 00:06:40.849
of the game and launch a web browser
 

00:06:40.849 --> 00:06:42.879
of the game and launch a web browser
which is almost always going to take a

00:06:42.879 --> 00:06:42.889
which is almost always going to take a
 

00:06:42.889 --> 00:06:44.409
which is almost always going to take a
long time to start up and it uses

00:06:44.409 --> 00:06:44.419
long time to start up and it uses
 

00:06:44.419 --> 00:06:48.219
long time to start up and it uses
battery and it uses data yeah why yeah

00:06:48.219 --> 00:06:48.229
battery and it uses data yeah why yeah
 

00:06:48.229 --> 00:06:49.450
battery and it uses data yeah why yeah
it's one of those things where it's also

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:49.460
it's one of those things where it's also
 

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:50.920
it's one of those things where it's also
it's also signed another question

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:50.930
it's also signed another question
 

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:52.149
it's also signed another question
whether you want to actually launch it

00:06:52.149 --> 00:06:52.159
whether you want to actually launch it
 

00:06:52.159 --> 00:06:53.770
whether you want to actually launch it
in the external browser launch it in a

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:53.780
in the external browser launch it in a
 

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:55.089
in the external browser launch it in a
webview you know I don't even know what

00:06:55.089 --> 00:06:55.099
webview you know I don't even know what
 

00:06:55.099 --> 00:06:57.309
webview you know I don't even know what
you want to do yeah it's like and the

00:06:57.309 --> 00:06:57.319
you want to do yeah it's like and the
 

00:06:57.319 --> 00:07:00.159
you want to do yeah it's like and the
thing is part of it part of it is the

00:07:00.159 --> 00:07:00.169
thing is part of it part of it is the
 

00:07:00.169 --> 00:07:01.270
thing is part of it part of it is the
fact that there's already the share

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:01.280
fact that there's already the share
 

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:03.279
fact that there's already the share
intent available but I understand that

00:07:03.279 --> 00:07:03.289
intent available but I understand that
 

00:07:03.289 --> 00:07:03.999
intent available but I understand that
you know there's a difference between

00:07:03.999 --> 00:07:04.009
you know there's a difference between
 

00:07:04.009 --> 00:07:05.409
you know there's a difference between
liking something or plus wanting

00:07:05.409 --> 00:07:05.419
liking something or plus wanting
 

00:07:05.419 --> 00:07:07.719
liking something or plus wanting
something and sharing it but if you'll

this is actually I think this is the
 

00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:45.010
this is actually I think this is the
first game of this sort that have

00:21:45.010 --> 00:21:45.020

00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:46.180
first game of this sort that have
actually liked the graphics because

00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:39.130
key is problematic because it is
 

00:24:39.130 --> 00:24:40.710
key is problematic because it is
implemented in different ways across

00:24:40.710 --> 00:24:40.720

that's what we would recommend at this

00:24:51.210 --> 00:24:51.220
that's what we would recommend at this
 

00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:52.680
that's what we would recommend at this
point yeah I mean given given that you

00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:52.690
point yeah I mean given given that you
 

00:24:52.690 --> 00:24:54.030
point yeah I mean given given that you
guys have a lot of space you could be

00:24:54.030 --> 00:24:54.040
guys have a lot of space you could be
 

00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:56.460
guys have a lot of space you could be
using for to pull up these kinds of new

00:24:56.460 --> 00:24:56.470
using for to pull up these kinds of new
 

00:24:56.470 --> 00:24:57.600

other buttons too I mean you don't like

00:24:59.220 --> 00:24:59.230

00:24:59.230 --> 00:25:01.350
other buttons too I mean you don't like
their know exactly if not likely this is

00:25:01.350 --> 00:25:01.360
their know exactly if not likely this is
 

00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:02.880
their know exactly if not likely this is
of me this is a devoid of buttons but

00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:02.890
of me this is a devoid of buttons but
 

00:25:02.890 --> 00:25:04.200
of me this is a devoid of buttons but
that the main problem with this is that

00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:04.210
that the main problem with this is that
 

00:25:04.210 --> 00:25:05.670
that the main problem with this is that
they're just not very discoverable and

00:25:05.670 --> 00:25:05.680

Tetris Shamu shimmer cha-cha Munoz uh
but you can draw them in any orientation

00:31:34.330 --> 00:31:34.340
but you can draw them in any orientation
 

00:31:34.340 --> 00:31:36.999
but you can draw them in any orientation
which honestly was the one thing I

00:31:36.999 --> 00:31:37.009
which honestly was the one thing I
 

00:31:37.009 --> 00:31:38.950
which honestly was the one thing I
didn't like because it meant I had to do

00:31:38.950 --> 00:31:38.960
didn't like because it meant I had to do
 

00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:40.629
didn't like because it meant I had to do
a lot of drawing and sometimes I get it

00:31:40.629 --> 00:31:40.639
a lot of drawing and sometimes I get it
 

00:31:40.639 --> 00:31:44.200
a lot of drawing and sometimes I get it
wrong but as an interface there's a

00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:44.210
wrong but as an interface there's a
 

00:31:44.210 --> 00:31:45.310
wrong but as an interface there's a
couple things that are really good about

00:31:45.310 --> 00:31:45.320
couple things that are really good about
 

00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:47.619
couple things that are really good about
it first it's very reactive it's got

00:31:47.619 --> 00:31:47.629
it first it's very reactive it's got
 

00:31:47.629 --> 00:31:48.909
it first it's very reactive it's got
this particle system which means

00:31:48.909 --> 00:31:48.919
this particle system which means
 

00:31:48.919 --> 00:31:50.499
this particle system which means
absolutely nothing but it's kind of cool

00:31:50.499 --> 00:31:50.509
absolutely nothing but it's kind of cool
 

00:31:50.509 --> 00:31:52.629
absolutely nothing but it's kind of cool
yeah and it shows you where you're

00:31:52.629 --> 00:31:52.639
yeah and it shows you where you're
 

00:31:52.639 --> 00:31:54.580
yeah and it shows you where you're
drawing it's just it's really really

00:31:54.580 --> 00:31:54.590
drawing it's just it's really really
 

00:31:54.590 --> 00:31:57.849
drawing it's just it's really really
good at that and then what's clever

00:31:57.849 --> 00:31:57.859
good at that and then what's clever
 

00:31:57.859 --> 00:32:00.190
good at that and then what's clever
about it is you're trying to fill space

00:32:00.190 --> 00:32:00.200
about it is you're trying to fill space
 

00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:04.599
about it is you're trying to fill space
so no matter what shape things are the

00:32:04.599 --> 00:32:04.609
so no matter what shape things are the
 

00:32:04.609 --> 00:32:06.519
so no matter what shape things are the
idea is you need to put them together so

00:32:06.519 --> 00:32:06.529
idea is you need to put them together so
 

00:32:06.529 --> 00:32:08.499
idea is you need to put them together so
that you can get these things too and if

00:32:08.499 --> 00:32:08.509
that you can get these things too and if
 

00:32:08.509 --> 00:32:10.570
that you can get these things too and if
you win crazy rectangles or squares the

00:32:10.570 --> 00:32:10.580
you win crazy rectangles or squares the
 

00:32:10.580 --> 00:32:12.639
you win crazy rectangles or squares the
internet that's your goal right well and

00:32:12.639 --> 00:32:12.649
internet that's your goal right well and
 

00:32:12.649 --> 00:32:14.979
internet that's your goal right well and
you're trying to fill the entire the

00:32:14.979 --> 00:32:14.989
you're trying to fill the entire the
 

00:32:14.989 --> 00:32:18.669
you're trying to fill the entire the
entirety of the board mm-hmm and if you

00:32:18.669 --> 00:32:18.679
entirety of the board mm-hmm and if you
 

00:32:18.679 --> 00:32:23.710
entirety of the board mm-hmm and if you
can um yeah if you can make a square for

00:32:23.710 --> 00:32:23.720
can um yeah if you can make a square for
 

00:32:23.720 --> 00:32:27.659
can um yeah if you can make a square for
instance like this well almost like that

00:32:27.659 --> 00:32:27.669
instance like this well almost like that
 

00:32:27.669 --> 00:32:30.460
instance like this well almost like that
let's see I think I'm going to need a

00:32:30.460 --> 00:32:30.470
let's see I think I'm going to need a
 

00:32:30.470 --> 00:32:34.150
let's see I think I'm going to need a
new shape there

00:32:34.150 --> 00:32:34.160
 

00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:37.190
darn it see this is where I would love

00:32:37.190 --> 00:32:37.200
darn it see this is where I would love
 

00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:40.280
darn it see this is where I would love
to have like better you know

00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:40.290
to have like better you know
 

00:32:40.290 --> 00:32:43.160
to have like better you know
intelligence of some kind why am i

00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:43.170
intelligence of some kind why am i
 

00:32:43.170 --> 00:32:46.310
intelligence of some kind why am i
everything I draw doesn't work ok there

00:32:46.310 --> 00:32:46.320
everything I draw doesn't work ok there
 

00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:50.030
everything I draw doesn't work ok there
we go all right yeah help me out here

00:32:50.030 --> 00:32:50.040
we go all right yeah help me out here
 

00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:51.470
we go all right yeah help me out here
man so also you have to think about that

00:32:51.470 --> 00:32:51.480
man so also you have to think about that
 

00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:53.240
man so also you have to think about that
block you can only draw it in the four

00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:53.250
block you can only draw it in the four
 

00:32:53.250 --> 00:32:55.040
block you can only draw it in the four
rotated orkut orientations for that

00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:55.050
rotated orkut orientations for that
 

00:32:55.050 --> 00:32:56.840
rotated orkut orientations for that
block right so you see you can't

00:32:56.840 --> 00:32:56.850
block right so you see you can't
 

00:32:56.850 --> 00:32:58.730
block right so you see you can't
unfortunately it's a little it's a

00:32:58.730 --> 00:32:58.740
unfortunately it's a little it's a
 

00:32:58.740 --> 00:33:00.200
unfortunately it's a little it's a
little gift to do you do have to think

00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:00.210
little gift to do you do have to think
 

00:33:00.210 --> 00:33:01.700
little gift to do you do have to think
back to the Block in its physical shape

00:33:01.700 --> 00:33:01.710
back to the Block in its physical shape
 

00:33:01.710 --> 00:33:03.860
back to the Block in its physical shape
rather than just it's so that it's you

00:33:03.860 --> 00:33:03.870
rather than just it's so that it's you
 

00:33:03.870 --> 00:33:05.330
rather than just it's so that it's you
can't draw its flipped orientation

00:33:05.330 --> 00:33:05.340
can't draw its flipped orientation
 

00:33:05.340 --> 00:33:07.310
can't draw its flipped orientation
basically right exactly you you have to

00:33:07.310 --> 00:33:07.320
basically right exactly you you have to
 

00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:11.240
basically right exactly you you have to
just drop rotated and so yeah for me

00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:11.250
just drop rotated and so yeah for me
 

00:33:11.250 --> 00:33:13.100
just drop rotated and so yeah for me
because I'm handicapped that way it was

00:33:13.100 --> 00:33:13.110
because I'm handicapped that way it was
 

00:33:13.110 --> 00:33:15.200
because I'm handicapped that way it was
a little more difficult which is weird

00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:15.210
a little more difficult which is weird
 

00:33:15.210 --> 00:33:18.470
a little more difficult which is weird
cuz i did so well on the ASVAB like the

00:33:18.470 --> 00:33:18.480
cuz i did so well on the ASVAB like the
 

00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:20.480
cuz i did so well on the ASVAB like the
spatial rotation stuff i don't know

00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:20.490
spatial rotation stuff i don't know
 

00:33:20.490 --> 00:33:22.880
spatial rotation stuff i don't know
maybe it's just anyway but I'm so now

00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:22.890
maybe it's just anyway but I'm so now
 

00:33:22.890 --> 00:33:24.500
maybe it's just anyway but I'm so now
laying the alcohol right there you go

00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:24.510
laying the alcohol right there you go
 

00:33:24.510 --> 00:33:27.950
laying the alcohol right there you go
now I'm gonna see that that made me a

00:33:27.950 --> 00:33:27.960
now I'm gonna see that that made me a
 

00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:30.320
now I'm gonna see that that made me a
huge rectangle and one thing that's kind

00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:30.330
huge rectangle and one thing that's kind
 

00:33:30.330 --> 00:33:32.270
huge rectangle and one thing that's kind
of cool about this is that while that

00:33:32.270 --> 00:33:32.280
of cool about this is that while that
 

00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:33.830
of cool about this is that while that
rectangles building i can actually make

00:33:33.830 --> 00:33:33.840
rectangles building i can actually make
 

00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:35.840
rectangles building i can actually make
it bigger yeah that's it that is really

00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:35.850
it bigger yeah that's it that is really
 

00:33:35.850 --> 00:33:38.210
it bigger yeah that's it that is really
cool so i don't know if that actually

00:33:38.210 --> 00:33:38.220
cool so i don't know if that actually
 

00:33:38.220 --> 00:33:41.840
cool so i don't know if that actually
helps anything but i can do it and then

00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:41.850
helps anything but i can do it and then
 

00:33:41.850 --> 00:33:43.820
helps anything but i can do it and then
as long as i wait for it to fill up it

00:33:43.820 --> 00:33:43.830
as long as i wait for it to fill up it
 

00:33:43.830 --> 00:33:45.770
as long as i wait for it to fill up it
gives me more score now that doesn't

00:33:45.770 --> 00:33:45.780
gives me more score now that doesn't
 

00:33:45.780 --> 00:33:47.420
gives me more score now that doesn't
seem like a big deal and a level like

00:33:47.420 --> 00:33:47.430
seem like a big deal and a level like
 

00:33:47.430 --> 00:33:48.680
seem like a big deal and a level like
this but in a level where you have very

00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:48.690
this but in a level where you have very
 

00:33:48.690 --> 00:33:52.400
this but in a level where you have very
little space and very little time that's

00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:52.410
little space and very little time that's
 

00:33:52.410 --> 00:33:53.810
little space and very little time that's
kind of a big deal do you wait for it to

00:33:53.810 --> 00:33:53.820
kind of a big deal do you wait for it to
 

00:33:53.820 --> 00:33:55.880
kind of a big deal do you wait for it to
fill up or do you tap it immediately to

00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:55.890
fill up or do you tap it immediately to
 

00:33:55.890 --> 00:34:01.130
fill up or do you tap it immediately to
get less score but more space mm-hmm as

00:34:01.130 --> 00:34:01.140
get less score but more space mm-hmm as
 

00:34:01.140 --> 00:34:03.530
get less score but more space mm-hmm as
you on the levels get more and more

00:34:03.530 --> 00:34:03.540
you on the levels get more and more
 

00:34:03.540 --> 00:34:05.750
you on the levels get more and more
difficult and you start moving from

00:34:05.750 --> 00:34:05.760
difficult and you start moving from
 

00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:09.140
difficult and you start moving from
these tetra munoz to more and more weird

00:34:09.140 --> 00:34:09.150
these tetra munoz to more and more weird
 

00:34:09.150 --> 00:34:11.090
these tetra munoz to more and more weird
and interesting shapes some of them are

00:34:11.090 --> 00:34:11.100
and interesting shapes some of them are
 

00:34:11.100 --> 00:34:15.800
and interesting shapes some of them are
quite frustrating mm-hmm and very very

00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:15.810
quite frustrating mm-hmm and very very
 

00:34:15.810 --> 00:34:18.340
quite frustrating mm-hmm and very very
large game board so actually I think I i

00:34:18.340 --> 00:34:18.350
large game board so actually I think I i
 

00:34:18.350 --> 00:34:21.380
large game board so actually I think I i
have to admit after several hours of

00:34:21.380 --> 00:34:21.390
have to admit after several hours of
 

00:34:21.390 --> 00:34:22.940
have to admit after several hours of
play I think I i ended up crapping out

00:34:22.940 --> 00:34:22.950
play I think I i ended up crapping out
 

00:34:22.950 --> 00:34:27.110
play I think I i ended up crapping out
on a level 4 or 5 which was gigantic it

00:34:27.110 --> 00:34:27.120
on a level 4 or 5 which was gigantic it
 

00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:29.270
on a level 4 or 5 which was gigantic it
was almost impossible to fill in the

00:34:29.270 --> 00:34:29.280
was almost impossible to fill in the
 

00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:32.090
was almost impossible to fill in the
time they gave you the same night that I

00:34:32.090 --> 00:34:32.100
time they gave you the same night that I
 

00:34:32.100 --> 00:34:33.470
time they gave you the same night that I
thought I'd like I know I was drawing

00:34:33.470 --> 00:34:33.480
thought I'd like I know I was drawing
 

00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:35.930
thought I'd like I know I was drawing
that correctly so I just didn't register

00:34:35.930 --> 00:34:35.940
that correctly so I just didn't register
 

00:34:35.940 --> 00:34:37.880
that correctly so I just didn't register
my draw no the the other thing that's

00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:37.890
my draw no the the other thing that's
 

00:34:37.890 --> 00:34:39.800
my draw no the the other thing that's
interesting is you'll notice that some

00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:39.810
interesting is you'll notice that some
 

00:34:39.810 --> 00:34:42.800
interesting is you'll notice that some
of these little blocks have cracks in

00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:42.810
of these little blocks have cracks in
 

00:34:42.810 --> 00:34:43.540
of these little blocks have cracks in
them

00:34:43.540 --> 00:34:43.550
them
 

00:34:43.550 --> 00:34:45.430
them
and that becomes important later on

00:34:45.430 --> 00:34:45.440
and that becomes important later on
 

00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:49.360
and that becomes important later on
because those will get removed if you

00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:49.370
because those will get removed if you
 

00:34:49.370 --> 00:34:51.910
because those will get removed if you
dont have space those are what they call

00:34:51.910 --> 00:34:51.920
dont have space those are what they call
 

00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:53.950
dont have space those are what they call
leftovers which are just you know once

00:34:53.950 --> 00:34:53.960
leftovers which are just you know once
 

00:34:53.960 --> 00:34:57.730
leftovers which are just you know once
you've drawn something mm-hmm I if part

00:34:57.730 --> 00:34:57.740
you've drawn something mm-hmm I if part
 

00:34:57.740 --> 00:35:00.550
you've drawn something mm-hmm I if part
of the shape forms a rectangle mm-hmm

00:35:00.550 --> 00:35:00.560
of the shape forms a rectangle mm-hmm
 

00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:02.380
of the shape forms a rectangle mm-hmm
and the rest of them don't like these

00:35:02.380 --> 00:35:02.390
and the rest of them don't like these
 

00:35:02.390 --> 00:35:05.860
and the rest of them don't like these
these two right here gosh I those are

00:35:05.860 --> 00:35:05.870
these two right here gosh I those are
 

00:35:05.870 --> 00:35:08.170
these two right here gosh I those are
now going to turn into leftovers and if

00:35:08.170 --> 00:35:08.180
now going to turn into leftovers and if
 

00:35:08.180 --> 00:35:09.760
now going to turn into leftovers and if
you run out of space those will get

00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:09.770
you run out of space those will get
 

00:35:09.770 --> 00:35:12.670
you run out of space those will get
removed and if that happens you'll get

00:38:38.830 --> 00:38:40.380
that's because I pretend to go and
review the game you get you get that you

00:38:40.380 --> 00:38:40.390
review the game you get you get that you
 

00:38:40.390 --> 00:38:41.910
review the game you get you get that you
get the truck you get that if you if you

00:38:41.910 --> 00:38:41.920
get the truck you get that if you if you
 

00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:44.100
get the truck you get that if you if you
hit the they gave you an incentive for

00:38:44.100 --> 00:38:44.110
hit the they gave you an incentive for
 

00:38:44.110 --> 00:38:49.110
hit the they gave you an incentive for
reviewing the game yeah so they didn't

00:38:49.110 --> 00:38:49.120
reviewing the game yeah so they didn't
 

00:38:49.120 --> 00:38:50.550
reviewing the game yeah so they didn't
actually say what could get a room they

00:38:50.550 --> 00:38:50.560
actually say what could get a room they
 

00:38:50.560 --> 00:38:52.740
actually say what could get a room they
didn't say what kind of you to get up to

00:38:52.740 --> 00:38:52.750
didn't say what kind of you to get up to
 

00:38:52.750 --> 00:38:54.480
didn't say what kind of you to get up to
get the wood it just said review the

00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:54.490
get the wood it just said review the
 

00:38:54.490 --> 00:38:56.070
get the wood it just said review the
game and get this I'm like cool so I

00:38:56.070 --> 00:38:56.080
game and get this I'm like cool so I
 

00:38:56.080 --> 00:38:57.420
game and get this I'm like cool so I
click the button and then I went back

00:38:57.420 --> 00:38:57.430
click the button and then I went back
 

00:38:57.430 --> 00:39:00.160
click the button and then I went back
and I got this which is kind of

00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:00.170
and I got this which is kind of
 

00:39:00.170 --> 00:39:08.690
and I got this which is kind of
okay so go ahead ok now the bummer is

00:39:08.690 --> 00:39:08.700
okay so go ahead ok now the bummer is
 

00:39:08.700 --> 00:39:11.900
okay so go ahead ok now the bummer is
that is it is that I can't actually

00:39:11.900 --> 00:39:11.910
that is it is that I can't actually
 

00:39:11.910 --> 00:39:15.320
that is it is that I can't actually
choose that bus for the monster warm-up

00:39:15.320 --> 00:39:15.330
choose that bus for the monster warm-up
 

00:39:15.330 --> 00:39:19.640
choose that bus for the monster warm-up
but that sucks I know I know but this

00:39:19.640 --> 00:39:19.650
but that sucks I know I know but this
 

00:39:19.650 --> 00:39:24.830
but that sucks I know I know but this
game is has got pretty good visuals for

00:39:24.830 --> 00:39:24.840
game is has got pretty good visuals for
 

00:39:24.840 --> 00:39:26.660
game is has got pretty good visuals for
you know for the style of game it is

00:39:26.660 --> 00:39:26.670
you know for the style of game it is
 

00:39:26.670 --> 00:39:28.790
you know for the style of game it is
which is you know kind of this a web

00:39:28.790 --> 00:39:28.800
which is you know kind of this a web
 

00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:33.470
which is you know kind of this a web
style of you know track yeah it's like a

00:39:33.470 --> 00:39:33.480
style of you know track yeah it's like a
 

00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:37.730
style of you know track yeah it's like a
four button you know basically I have to

00:39:37.730 --> 00:39:37.740
four button you know basically I have to
 

00:39:37.740 --> 00:39:40.070
four button you know basically I have to
ask of the wheels on this truck filled

00:39:40.070 --> 00:39:40.080
ask of the wheels on this truck filled
 

00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:41.660
ask of the wheels on this truck filled
with helium because i'm not sure that

00:39:41.660 --> 00:39:41.670
with helium because i'm not sure that
 

00:39:41.670 --> 00:39:44.630
with helium because i'm not sure that
those physics are legit ah that's

00:39:44.630 --> 00:39:44.640
those physics are legit ah that's
 

00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:47.120
those physics are legit ah that's
because you don't live in America my

00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:47.130
because you don't live in America my
 

00:39:47.130 --> 00:39:54.230
because you don't live in America my
friend you'll learn yeah monstered Mont

00:39:54.230 --> 00:39:54.240
friend you'll learn yeah monstered Mont
 

00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:56.690
friend you'll learn yeah monstered Mont
this this this has monster truck physics

00:39:56.690 --> 00:39:56.700
this this this has monster truck physics
 

00:39:56.700 --> 00:39:59.030
this this this has monster truck physics
yeah kind of physics we invented here

00:39:59.030 --> 00:39:59.040
yeah kind of physics we invented here
 

00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:00.980
yeah kind of physics we invented here
monster trucks are completely different

00:40:00.980 --> 00:40:00.990
monster trucks are completely different
 

00:40:00.990 --> 00:40:03.470
monster trucks are completely different
from other trucks they're monstrous the

00:40:03.470 --> 00:40:03.480
from other trucks they're monstrous the
 

00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:05.780
from other trucks they're monstrous the
thing oh yeah there we are you have to

00:40:05.780 --> 00:40:05.790
thing oh yeah there we are you have to
 

00:40:05.790 --> 00:40:07.190
thing oh yeah there we are you have to
have you have to have gratuitous and

00:40:07.190 --> 00:40:07.200
have you have to have gratuitous and
 

00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:09.920
have you have to have gratuitous and
unnecessary the pictures of people who

00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:09.930
unnecessary the pictures of people who
 

00:40:09.930 --> 00:40:11.540
unnecessary the pictures of people who
look like danica patrick in your game

00:40:11.540 --> 00:40:11.550
look like danica patrick in your game
 

00:40:11.550 --> 00:40:15.620
look like danica patrick in your game
that's right so America I'm thinking I'm

00:40:15.620 --> 00:40:15.630
that's right so America I'm thinking I'm
 

00:40:15.630 --> 00:40:18.140

in the world honestly but I'll tell you

00:40:23.060 --> 00:40:23.070
in the world honestly but I'll tell you
 

00:40:23.070 --> 00:40:25.190
in the world honestly but I'll tell you
what sets this apart is not only do they

00:40:25.190 --> 00:40:25.200
what sets this apart is not only do they
 

00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:28.220
what sets this apart is not only do they
have a fairly good set uh not not

00:40:28.220 --> 00:40:28.230
have a fairly good set uh not not
 

00:40:28.230 --> 00:40:30.980
have a fairly good set uh not not
perfect the presentation is not perfect

00:40:30.980 --> 00:40:30.990
perfect the presentation is not perfect
 

00:40:30.990 --> 00:40:34.100
perfect the presentation is not perfect
there's a few kind of cheesy icons and

00:40:34.100 --> 00:40:34.110
there's a few kind of cheesy icons and
 

00:40:34.110 --> 00:40:35.930
there's a few kind of cheesy icons and
some its radiance that look really

00:40:35.930 --> 00:40:35.940
some its radiance that look really
 

00:40:35.940 --> 00:40:38.890
some its radiance that look really
really out of place but in general

00:40:38.890 --> 00:40:38.900
really out of place but in general
 

00:40:38.900 --> 00:40:41.750
really out of place but in general
especially in the game yeah it looks

00:40:41.750 --> 00:40:41.760
especially in the game yeah it looks
 

00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:45.440
especially in the game yeah it looks
great uh and unlike many of the racing

00:40:45.440 --> 00:40:45.450
great uh and unlike many of the racing
 

00:40:45.450 --> 00:40:47.120
great uh and unlike many of the racing
games that we've reviewed they have some

00:40:47.120 --> 00:40:47.130
games that we've reviewed they have some
 

00:40:47.130 --> 00:40:49.730
games that we've reviewed they have some
great crash physics mm-hmm they really

00:40:49.730 --> 00:40:49.740
great crash physics mm-hmm they really
 

00:40:49.740 --> 00:40:52.250
great crash physics mm-hmm they really
really do yeah yeah give us a crash give

00:40:52.250 --> 00:40:52.260
really do yeah yeah give us a crash give
 

00:40:52.260 --> 00:40:55.670
really do yeah yeah give us a crash give
us crash crash for daddy ooh no that's

00:40:55.670 --> 00:40:55.680
us crash crash for daddy ooh no that's
 

00:40:55.680 --> 00:40:57.260
us crash crash for daddy ooh no that's
nice Abrash crash whole this is a good

00:40:57.260 --> 00:40:57.270
nice Abrash crash whole this is a good
 

00:40:57.270 --> 00:41:03.720
nice Abrash crash whole this is a good
one here we are oh there you go yeah

00:41:03.720 --> 00:41:03.730
one here we are oh there you go yeah
 

00:41:03.730 --> 00:41:06.060
one here we are oh there you go yeah
yeah I don't know that the truck is a

00:41:06.060 --> 00:41:06.070
yeah I don't know that the truck is a
 

00:41:06.070 --> 00:41:07.440
yeah I don't know that the truck is a
little better I think than the car I

00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:07.450
little better I think than the car I
 

00:41:07.450 --> 00:41:09.180
little better I think than the car I
think they have better ya better crash

00:41:09.180 --> 00:41:09.190
think they have better ya better crash
 

00:41:09.190 --> 00:41:12.020
think they have better ya better crash
model they do they do so but yeah they

00:41:12.020 --> 00:41:12.030
model they do they do so but yeah they
 

00:41:12.030 --> 00:41:14.550
model they do they do so but yeah they
now they do have some weird physics like

00:41:14.550 --> 00:41:14.560
now they do have some weird physics like
 

00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:16.620
now they do have some weird physics like
you is actually possible to lose a wheel

00:41:16.620 --> 00:41:16.630
you is actually possible to lose a wheel
 

00:41:16.630 --> 00:41:20.070
you is actually possible to lose a wheel
without ending the race oh wow I I know

00:41:20.070 --> 00:41:20.080
without ending the race oh wow I I know
 

00:41:20.080 --> 00:41:22.740
without ending the race oh wow I I know
this because last night I lost three

00:41:22.740 --> 00:41:22.750
this because last night I lost three
 

00:41:22.750 --> 00:41:24.990
this because last night I lost three
wheels and was in it unable to do

00:41:24.990 --> 00:41:25.000
wheels and was in it unable to do
 

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:28.200
wheels and was in it unable to do
anything but the race was still on you

00:41:28.200 --> 00:41:28.210
anything but the race was still on you
 

00:41:28.210 --> 00:41:33.660
anything but the race was still on you
know why America uh-huh absolutely so

00:41:33.660 --> 00:41:33.670
know why America uh-huh absolutely so
 

00:41:33.670 --> 00:41:37.349
know why America uh-huh absolutely so
whoa that is awesome uh gets actually

whoa that is awesome uh gets actually
the first time you've ever sworn on the

00:41:39.210 --> 00:41:39.220
the first time you've ever sworn on the
 

00:41:39.220 --> 00:41:43.050
the first time you've ever sworn on the
on the program what I think I think what

00:41:43.050 --> 00:41:43.060
on the program what I think I think what
 

00:41:43.060 --> 00:41:48.510
on the program what I think I think what
it did I swear so I know I know shocking

00:41:48.510 --> 00:41:48.520
it did I swear so I know I know shocking
 

00:41:48.520 --> 00:41:51.960
it did I swear so I know I know shocking
I totally you saying you saying you sang

00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:51.970
I totally you saying you saying you sang

might have oh there we are you only get
 

00:41:59.440 --> 00:42:04.200
might have oh there we are you only get
to use my bus yeah i know but that's a

00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:04.210
to use my bus yeah i know but that's a
 

00:42:04.210 --> 00:42:13.040
to use my bus yeah i know but that's a
possible toxin we just fill in yeah so

00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:13.050
possible toxin we just fill in yeah so
 

00:42:13.050 --> 00:42:16.950
possible toxin we just fill in yeah so
so yeah uh I don't know what else what

00:42:16.950 --> 00:42:16.960
so yeah uh I don't know what else what
 

00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:18.660
so yeah uh I don't know what else what
else to say on this game I believe this

00:42:18.660 --> 00:42:18.670
else to say on this game I believe this
 

00:42:18.670 --> 00:42:21.090
else to say on this game I believe this
game also plates throw in the lock

00:42:21.090 --> 00:42:21.100
game also plates throw in the lock
 

00:42:21.100 --> 00:42:24.390
game also plates throw in the lock
