00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.520
 

00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.620
We're asked what is the
equation of line B?

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:06.750
And they tell us that line A has
an equation y is equal to

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.590
2x plus 11.

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:10.770
And they say that the
line B contains the

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:13.310
point 6, negative 7.

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:18.520
And they tell us lines A and B
are perpendicular, so that

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:25.680
means that slope of
B must be negative

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.200
inverse of slope of A.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.150
 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.490
So what we'll do is figure out
the slope of A, then take the

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:35.690
negative inverse of it.

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.000
Then we'll know the slope of B,
then we can use this point

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.210
right here to fill in the
gaps and figure out B's

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:41.560
y-intercept.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:42.590
So what's the slope of A?

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:45.020
This is already in
slope-intercept form.

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.570
The slope of A is right there,
it's the 2, mx plus b.

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.540
So the slope here
is equal to 2.

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:54.590
So the slope of A is 2.

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:56.860
What is the slope of B?

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:01.850
So what is B's slope going
to have to be?

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:03.740
Well, it's perpendicular to
A, so it's going to be the

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:05.420
negative inverse of this.

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.040
The inverse of two is 1/2.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.700
The negative inverse of
that is negative 1/2.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.300
So B's slope is negative 1/2.

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.520
So we know that B's equation
has to be y is equal to its

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.290
slope, m times x plus
some y-intercept.

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:27.720
We still don't know what the
y-intercept of B is, but we

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.400
can use this information
to figure it out.

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:37.210
We know that y is equal
to negative 7 when

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.480
x is equal to 6.

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:48.420
Negative 1/2 times
6 plus b, right?

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.730
I just know that this is on the
point, so this point must

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:55.700
satisfy the equation
of line B.

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.420
So let's work out what b must
be-- or what b, the

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.380
y-intercept, this is a lowercase
b, not the line B.

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.320
So we have negative 7 is equal
to-- what's negative

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.650
1/2 half times 6?

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:10.840
That's not a b there,
that's a 6.

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.500
What's negative 1/2 times 6?

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.050
It's negative 3, is equal
to negative 3 plus our

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.380
y-intercept.

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.880
Let's add 3 to both sides of
this equation, so if we add 3

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.150
to both sides-- I just want to
get rid of this 3 right here--

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.800
what do we get?

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.310
The left-hand side, negative
7 plus 3 is negative 4, and

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.720
that's going to be equal to--
these guys cancel out-- that's

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.170
equal to b, our y-intercept.

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.900
So this right here
is a negative 4.

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:45.980
So the equation of line B is y
is equal to-- its slope is

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.160
a negative inverse of this
character-- so negative 1/2,

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:50.770
negative 1/2 x.

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:56.590
And its y-intercept we just
figured out is negative 4.

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.160
And we are done.

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.660
