SPEAKER: In this
video, we'll talk

00:00:01.506 --> 00:00:04.440
about how to use Google
Cloud Pub/Sub to enable

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.360
real-time developer
notifications

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:07.920
for your subscriptions.

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:11.340
For more information about how
to set up Google Cloud Pub/Sub,

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:12.870
go here.

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.450
Unlike the Google
Play Developer API--

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.860
which requires
you, the developer,

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:19.500
to send requests to Google--

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.290
Cloud Pub/Sub works
the other way around,

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:25.890
sending information
from Google to you.

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.070
When does this happen?

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:29.790
Anytime a subscription
entitlement changes,

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:32.759
such as subscription
renewal, cancellation,

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.930
or if the user has entered a
grace period or account hold.

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.310
With real-time
developer notifications,

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:42.630
you'll receive a purchase token
directly from Cloud Pub/Sub

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:46.410
anytime there is an update
to an existing subscription.

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.150
This purchase token
doesn't contain

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:49.810
the details of the change.

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:51.630
So you'll need to send
the purchase token

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:55.590
from your secure back end to
the Google Play Developer API

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.580
to get the updated information
attached to the purchase token.

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.400
Once verified, you will
have the revised information

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.160
about the subscription, which
can be stored on your back end

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.130
server as well as sent
to your Android app

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.500
if needed to ensure
users have access

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.960
to the appropriate in-app
content and services.

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.660
And that's it.

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:24.630
By enabling real-time
developer notifications,

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.535
you are able to stay up-to-date
on your users' subscription

00:01:27.535 --> 00:01:28.035
status.

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.310
