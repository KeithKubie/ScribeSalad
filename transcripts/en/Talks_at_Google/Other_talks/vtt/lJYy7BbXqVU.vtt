DIANE SOLINGER:
I'm Diane Solinger.

00:00:07.824 --> 00:00:10.070
I'm the manager of
the GooglersGive team.

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:12.490
We're the team that sits
in people operations,

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:15.890
HR here at Google, that
works with our employees,

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:19.120
so all you great Googlers to
help you give and volunteer

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:21.650
to organizations and
causes that you care about.

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.590
And we our largely known
for a couple big things.

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.970
One is the Googler
Gift Match Program.

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:30.300
So every Googler
has the opportunity

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.360
to make contributions and have
those matched by Google, up

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.840
to $6,000 per Googler each year.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.480
So just in case you
didn't know that,

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.910
remember your gift
match benefit.

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:42.750
Additionally, we have
donations for doers.

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.880
So if you volunteer, every hour
generates $10 in Google support

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.198
to the organization
that you volunteer with,

00:00:50.198 --> 00:00:52.260
up to $2,500 a year.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.810
And right now you'll see
a couple things happening.

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:57.820
We also launched disaster
matching campaigns.

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:59.670
So there's one
going on right now

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.270
to support the flood
relief in India.

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.850
And soon, very soon, maybe
within the next hour even,

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.700
we will have an Ebola relief
disaster campaign going on.

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.060
In that case, Googlers get
an extra $1,000 of gift

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.980
match to support those
organizations that

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.320
are curated and featured
for those campaigns.

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:22.300
So all those things can be
found at go/googlersgive.

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.010
If you want to request
a match, it's go/give.

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:29.320
And for disaster relief,
its' go/givehelp.

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.410
So just a little
bit about the team.

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:33.390
We're a global team, 13 people.

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.426
We rely on ambassadors.

00:01:35.426 --> 00:01:37.620
So anybody interested
in getting more involved

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:39.280
in helping Googlers
get involved,

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.404
we are looking for
ambassadors to help us.

00:01:41.404 --> 00:01:43.380
We've got about 160
around the world that

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.300
help us implement programs and
design things that make sense

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.240
for their teams or
for their office,

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.670
and join into big
things like this, which

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.940
is the Education
for All Campaign.

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.560
Education for All is
really what it says.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.520
It's about trying to
help Googlers support

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.540
educational
organizations in ways

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:03.930
that mean something to them.

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.910
But also to bring us
together as a team,

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:09.779
as a global group of Googlers,
to support a unified cause

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:13.160
that we find Googlers
want to rally around.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.990
Education tends to be
the number one thing

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:17.170
that Googlers are
interested in supporting.

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.360
And we find sometimes that it's
kind of analysis paralysis.

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:21.320
What do I do?

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.260
There's so many choices.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:24.860
How do I get involved?

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:26.260
Where should I give?

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.600
So the campaign that's
been pulled together

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.610
is to really kind of bring
some focus in on education

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.485
and provide some
featured organization

00:02:33.485 --> 00:02:36.370
choices for donations,
and local volunteering

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.902
opportunities for
you to get engaged.

00:02:38.902 --> 00:02:41.854
So that is
go/education campaign.

00:02:41.854 --> 00:02:43.639
This is part of the
campaign as well.

00:02:43.639 --> 00:02:45.680
Because we want to shine
a light on organizations

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.410
that provide an education
opportunity for us

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.530
to learn more about education
issues and opportunities to get

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:52.030
involved.

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.400
So this panel has come
together to address that.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.730
We're really fortunate to
have wonderful people here

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.160
to talk about two contexts.

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.580
And we're going to lay it
out this way, a little bit

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:06.690
about what's going on in the US.

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.940
And we'll have two
wonderful people

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.670
involved in that
from DonorsChoose.

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.592
And then we'll talk a
little bit about education

00:03:13.592 --> 00:03:16.510
outside the U.S. And that
will be focused mostly

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.270
on The Philippines.

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:19.620
We are a global company.

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.250
And people are
interested in both.

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.740
And I think what we'll find
is that, although the U.S. is

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:27.651
a developed countries, there's a
lot of parallels between what's

00:03:27.651 --> 00:03:29.025
happening in the
developing world

00:03:29.025 --> 00:03:31.310
and what's happening here
with respect to education.

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.600
There's a gap no
matter where you look.

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.545
And I think people
really want to help.

00:03:35.545 --> 00:03:38.480
And that's what we're
here to talk about today.

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:43.500
So to my right is Oliver.

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.770
Oliver Hurst-Hiller is the
Chief Technology Officer

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:48.180
for DonorsChoose.

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.170
He is also the head of product.

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:53.022
He went to DonorsChoose
in I think 2006.

00:03:53.022 --> 00:03:53.688
Is that correct?

00:03:53.688 --> 00:03:55.176
OLIVER HURST-HILLER:
That's correct.

00:03:55.176 --> 00:03:56.967
DIANE SOLINGER: And he
came from Microsoft.

00:03:56.967 --> 00:03:59.650
Ooh!

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:01.620
But he's found the light.

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.671
He's helping the world.

00:04:03.671 --> 00:04:05.690
And if you want to just
give a little bit more

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:08.270
about your background and what
you're doing at DonorsChoose.

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:09.896
Tell us about DonorsChoose too.

00:04:09.896 --> 00:04:11.975
And maybe how Google's
been working with you.

00:04:11.975 --> 00:04:14.720
OLIVER HURST-HILLER: Yeah,
so I run a-- first of all,

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.444
thank you guys for
having us today.

00:04:16.444 --> 00:04:17.760
This is super cool.

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.459
I'm sitting up here with a
bestselling author and Grammy

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:23.130
award-winning multi-platinum
recording artists.

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:24.214
I'm like the other guy.

00:04:24.214 --> 00:04:28.796
So I'll try to be
brief so you guys can

00:04:28.796 --> 00:04:31.307
here from these amazing
panelists sitting next to me.

00:04:31.307 --> 00:04:32.890
Yeah, so I run product
and engineering

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:34.650
at DonorsChoose.org.

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:37.570
And we're website where public
school teachers post their best

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:40.260
ideas for classroom
projects that their schools

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:41.740
can't otherwise afford.

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:44.840
Think of it as like a
Kickstarter for classrooms.

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:49.354
Folks on the internet help
bring these projects to life.

00:04:49.354 --> 00:04:50.520
Many people don't know this.

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.670
Unlike say an eBay,
or a Kickstarter,

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:53.930
we don't then send a check.

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:56.490
We actually fulfill
the project ourselves.

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:58.380
So if it's resources,
we deliver them.

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:00.910
If it's a field trip, we
pay the bus company directly

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:04.681
and help make the
field trip happen.

00:05:04.681 --> 00:05:05.180
It works.

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:05.755
It's amazing.

00:05:05.755 --> 00:05:07.810
It was founded 14 years
ago by a public school

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:09.780
teacher in the Bronx.

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:11.430
And it spread from
his classroom,

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:14.310
to the rest of the Bronx, to
the rest of New York City.

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:15.446
It's now nationwide.

00:05:15.446 --> 00:05:18.430
We've done more
than $260 million

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:21.230
in donations to
classrooms [INAUDIBLE],

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:24.470
more than 12 million students
on the receiving end.

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:27.115
More than half of the public
schools in the country

00:05:27.115 --> 00:05:29.700
have a teacher who's
used the website, which

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:30.679
is kind of staggering.

00:05:30.679 --> 00:05:33.220
There's more than 95,000 public
schools in the United States.

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:37.940
So we're really
proud of that reach.

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:40.340
And what else can I add?

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:43.840
Some of the most innovative
things that we've done,

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:45.210
we've done with Google.

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:48.180
So I want to take a moment
to thank you guys for that,

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:51.450
and also to remind you of them.

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:54.870
Because Google has been
a special partner for us.

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:57.440
Because Google is
willing to take

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.230
risks with us, and
willing to experiment,

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:01.660
and willing to be
innovative, and find

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:04.460
ways to advance both
of our missions.

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:07.920
So one thing we've
done together is around

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:11.300
getting more AP science,
engineering, and math classes

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:13.760
into under-served communities.

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:16.640
And so we're partnering with
Google and College Board,

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:19.150
and essentially putting
incentives in place

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:21.430
for the teachers
at that school who

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:23.910
have students that
show potential

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:26.130
to excel in these areas,
but are essentially

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:29.070
under-served by the
courses aren't there.

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:32.650
So we put incentives in
place to start new AP classes

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:33.370
in those areas.

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:36.670
Or if there are AP classes,
to add enrollment, and extend

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:38.400
them, and get resources to them.

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:40.550
And that's an amazing program.

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:43.230
We do that with Google, and with
the College Board, like I said.

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:45.550
DIANE SOLINGER: Can I
ask you something else?

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:48.538
You raised another--
Google has granted funds

00:06:48.538 --> 00:06:49.996
through Google.org
to DonorsChoose.

00:06:49.996 --> 00:06:53.360
And there's another grantee
that is called Equal Opportunity

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:56.720
Schools that is working
kind of in that same space.

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:59.790
Are they involved in helping
identify the students that

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:02.049
might be part of
those AP classes?

00:07:02.049 --> 00:07:04.340
Is there some collaboration
between these two grantees?

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:05.521
OLIVER HURST-HILLER:
There might be.

00:07:05.521 --> 00:07:07.896
DIANE SOLINGER: It might be
Google.org in the background.

00:07:07.896 --> 00:07:08.590
[INAUDIBLE].

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:09.395
OLIVER HURST-HILLER:
It might be Google

00:07:09.395 --> 00:07:11.330
behind the scenes
putting it all together.

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:13.316
For us, part of the role
of the College Board

00:07:13.316 --> 00:07:17.310
is that because the College
Board sees test results

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:20.280
for students well before they
would get to the AP level--

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:22.230
so, for example, the PSATs.

00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:25.372
And it turns out, the PSATs
are a pretty good predictor--

00:07:25.372 --> 00:07:27.580
we can all say what we want
about standardized tests.

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:29.980
But in underrepresented
communities, African American

00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:33.650
and Latino communities,
they are representative

00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:35.624
of high potential.

00:07:35.624 --> 00:07:37.790
So with the College Board,
they can say to us, look,

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:40.800
we know this school
has high potential

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:44.117
for advanced courses
in the STEM areas.

00:07:44.117 --> 00:07:45.450
But there's no AP classes there.

00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:48.860
Because they also know where
there's AP classes because they

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:50.380
administer the tests.

00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:52.200
So in that way,
College Board has

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:55.874
been a partner which works
with us in order to help focus.

00:07:55.874 --> 00:07:58.082
Another thing we've done
together that was super cool

00:07:58.082 --> 00:08:01.080
was helping get more
girls learning to code.

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:04.124
And we've done with partnership
with Google, and Khan Academy,

00:08:04.124 --> 00:08:04.950
and Code Academy.

00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:08.840
And obviously there's so
much excitement and interest

00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:10.280
around this issue.

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:13.270
But actually moving the
ball forward is hard.

00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:16.840
And a bunch of forces,
societal and otherwise,

00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:20.320
are working against
us historically.

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:22.370
And I think it's a
really innovate way

00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:23.828
they're trying to
lick the problem.

00:08:23.828 --> 00:08:26.570
And so basically if
a teacher or-- we

00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:31.395
incentives in place for
teachers and students

00:08:31.395 --> 00:08:33.287
to essentially take
coding courses.

00:08:33.287 --> 00:08:34.870
And then the teacher
will get a reward

00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:36.964
in the form of dollars
they can bring resources

00:08:36.964 --> 00:08:39.020
to their classroom, and
same for the students.

00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:42.350
And the last thing I'll
mention is really neat.

00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:44.500
We did it this year
for back to school.

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:47.090
And it started in the Bay
Area, and ended just a week ago

00:08:47.090 --> 00:08:48.030
in Detroit.

00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:51.220
For 11 communities
across the country,

00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:54.840
Google backed what we call a
surprise flash funding, where

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:56.609
it's like-- we have
videos of this.

00:08:56.609 --> 00:08:57.650
And it will make you cry.

00:08:57.650 --> 00:09:01.420
So the students, and
teachers, and administrators

00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:04.150
are invited an event.

00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:06.490
They think they're
going to get some grant

00:09:06.490 --> 00:09:08.610
and other things
are going to happen.

00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:10.980
And basically it's revealed
to them at that moment

00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:13.320
that Google has funded
for back to school

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:16.222
every single classroom request
in that entire community.

00:09:16.222 --> 00:09:17.680
And these aren't
small communities.

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:22.190
It's like Bay Area,
Detroit, Seattle, big ones.

00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:24.040
And everybody just goes bananas.

00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:26.360
And the Googlers walk
in carrying the stuff.

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:27.842
And everybody's
crying and hugging.

00:09:27.842 --> 00:09:29.550
It's an amazing to
start the school year.

00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:32.600
So thank you guys
for backing that.

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:34.969
DIANE SOLINGER: I
think it was amazing,

00:09:34.969 --> 00:09:36.510
from what I've heard
out of that too.

00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:39.360
I mentioned Equal Opportunity
School is another grantee.

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:42.750
But when you talked about
Khan Academy and code.org,

00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:45.030
they're also organizations
that Google works with.

00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:48.200
So in some ways, I think,
which is wonderful for me

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:50.685
to hear as a Googler, but
to remind myself also,

00:09:50.685 --> 00:09:53.800
I think we have a lot of power
as a company to be a convener,

00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:55.540
and to bring these
organizations together

00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:58.364
who have different skill
sets and sets of expertise.

00:09:58.364 --> 00:09:59.780
So, again, you've
got what you do.

00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:02.930
Khan and Code do what they do.

00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:05.250
And here we are
seeing the landscape,

00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:06.774
and trying to bring
it all together

00:10:06.774 --> 00:10:08.070
so that we can have the
most impact together.

00:10:08.070 --> 00:10:09.486
OLIVER HURST-HILLER:
It's so cool.

00:10:09.486 --> 00:10:10.990
DIANE SOLINGER:
Yeah, it's awesome.

00:10:10.990 --> 00:10:14.860
So if I was a
teacher-- well, here's

00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:16.000
a story, a little vignette.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.015
So I know someone who was on
the board of a small charter

00:10:20.015 --> 00:10:22.973
school in San Francisco.

00:10:22.973 --> 00:10:25.230
The school did not know
about [INAUDIBLE] at all.

00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:28.060
And then they saw the whole
Bay Area surprise stuff

00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:30.120
happening, which was wonderful.

00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:31.680
The teachers didn't
know about it.

00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:33.870
So where you talk a little
bit about the business

00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:36.610
model and such, you say
guerrilla marketing,

00:10:36.610 --> 00:10:37.500
would you say that?

00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:39.969
How are teachers
learning about this?

00:10:39.969 --> 00:10:42.690
And how does the general public
know how to get involved?

00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:44.023
OLIVER HURST-HILLER: It's funny.

00:10:44.023 --> 00:10:46.967
When Charles Best-- who's
the public school teacher who

00:10:46.967 --> 00:10:49.050
founded the org and still
runs it 14 years later--

00:10:49.050 --> 00:10:52.910
when he founded the organization
in his classroom in the Bronx--

00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:54.070
we have a marketplace.

00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:56.140
Think of it as like a
philanthropic marketplace.

00:10:56.140 --> 00:10:58.181
On the one side are teachers
with their requests.

00:10:58.181 --> 00:11:01.000
On the other side are what we
call citizen donors, and then

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.490
also corporate backers.

00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:03.940
When he started
the organization,

00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:07.000
he had to do a lot of work on
both sides of that marketplace

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.520
to have the liquidity to
make the whole thing work.

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:12.750
He had to sort of basically
bribe teachers to use the site.

00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:16.900
Because if a website has never
given a dollar to a classroom,

00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:18.430
why would a teacher
who's so busy

00:11:18.430 --> 00:11:20.850
spend their time putting
a request up there.

00:11:20.850 --> 00:11:24.474
And then he also had
to bring donors there

00:11:24.474 --> 00:11:26.140
with just a couple
projects on the site.

00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:27.800
Saying, well, it's
all about choice,

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:29.716
But actually there's
only eight projects there

00:11:29.716 --> 00:11:31.522
because we started a month ago.

00:11:31.522 --> 00:11:34.380
So initially, he had to
spend a ton of effort

00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:35.130
making the market.

00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:37.300
And when I joined the
org eight years ago,

00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:39.670
we had staff members
who were focused

00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:42.150
on driving awareness
among teachers.

00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:47.522
And, fortunately, in 2014, we
now have a level of awareness,

00:11:47.522 --> 00:11:49.980
with the exception of maybe
that school and other schools--

00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:50.920
DIANE SOLINGER:
It's a small school.

00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:53.128
OLIVER HURST-HILLER: But we
have a level of awareness

00:11:53.128 --> 00:11:55.310
where the teachers are
coming to our site.

00:11:55.310 --> 00:11:57.768
And they're asking for stuff
that they can't get elsewhere.

00:11:57.768 --> 00:12:01.302
And we're really racing
on the citizen donor side,

00:12:01.302 --> 00:12:02.760
racing to keep up
with that demand,

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:05.260
and trying to find innovative
ways to get them funding.

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:07.130
So at this point,
it's essentially

00:12:07.130 --> 00:12:09.037
like a word of mouth thing.

00:12:09.037 --> 00:12:10.870
For example, when you're
on boarded at Teach

00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:13.290
for America, when they take
this recent college grad.

00:12:13.290 --> 00:12:17.570
And they say, hey, you're about
to dive into a challenging

00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:20.500
situation at high needs
school, part of their briefing

00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:22.319
includes DonorsChoose.org
You go here.

00:12:22.319 --> 00:12:24.360
And this is where you get
the resources you need.

00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:28.580
So the good news is that the
word of mouth has taken over.

00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:31.480
And we have a lot of work
to do with Google's help,

00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:33.252
and get those projects funded.

00:12:33.252 --> 00:12:34.960
DIANE SOLINGER: Are
you seeing any trends

00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:36.980
in what teachers are needing?

00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:39.250
And what people are
interested in funding?

00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:42.312
OLIVER HURST-HILLER: Yeah, so
I would say-- one of the things

00:12:42.312 --> 00:12:44.520
that people may not realize
until they visit the site

00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:46.311
and actually look at
the classroom requests

00:12:46.311 --> 00:12:52.677
is that-- you see some of
the stuff, which is just,

00:12:52.677 --> 00:12:53.260
we have a rug.

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:54.100
It's disgusting.

00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:54.899
It's 10 years old.

00:12:54.899 --> 00:12:56.440
The kids sit on it
every day to read.

00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:57.720
Can we have a new rug?

00:12:57.720 --> 00:12:59.050
Or we need paper.

00:12:59.050 --> 00:13:01.049
How can we do anything
without paper?

00:13:01.049 --> 00:13:03.132
So sometime's it's these
really basic essentials--

00:13:03.132 --> 00:13:05.048
DIANE SOLINGER: We don't
like paper at Google.

00:13:05.048 --> 00:13:07.020
Get the Chrome books.

00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:10.180
OLIVER HURST-HILLER: We have
those requests too, actually.

00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:12.315
So sometimes it's for
these basic essentials.

00:13:12.315 --> 00:13:14.065
You just can't run a
classroom without it.

00:13:14.065 --> 00:13:16.472
But many of the
requests are teachers

00:13:16.472 --> 00:13:18.680
who are looking to be
innovators in their classrooms.

00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:19.530
They're looking to
be experimental.

00:13:19.530 --> 00:13:21.071
They're looking to
try something new.

00:13:21.071 --> 00:13:22.810
It might be a book
that's never bee

00:13:22.810 --> 00:13:24.470
taught for this
particular curriculum.

00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:25.970
Or it might be a
piece of technology

00:13:25.970 --> 00:13:28.260
which the school's not yet
using in the classroom.

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:29.676
But they're a
little tech forward.

00:13:29.676 --> 00:13:32.150
And they want to try.

00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:34.150
And it's just, as
you can imagine,

00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:39.180
there isn't a natural
budgeting way in the way

00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:41.066
that schools are
funded today, in terms

00:13:41.066 --> 00:13:42.907
of the district and the
school, for teachers

00:13:42.907 --> 00:13:44.740
to think outside the
box, and they get money

00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:45.910
to think outside the box.

00:13:45.910 --> 00:13:47.610
It's like you're
really just hoping

00:13:47.610 --> 00:13:49.790
you got the money
you got last year.

00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:52.049
And so one of the most
exciting things for us

00:13:52.049 --> 00:13:53.590
is seeing the stuff
on the site where

00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:55.230
the teachers are
being innovative.

00:13:55.230 --> 00:13:56.520
And they're outside the box.

00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:59.060
And they're trying something
new, and taking a risk.

00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:01.050
And then citizen
donors, this person

00:14:01.050 --> 00:14:03.341
hasn't had to go through sort
of the whole bureaucracy,

00:14:03.341 --> 00:14:04.930
and champion an
idea which may fail.

00:14:04.930 --> 00:14:08.210
And you guys know about the
value of experimentation.

00:14:08.210 --> 00:14:10.216
So one of these we're
very excited about

00:14:10.216 --> 00:14:12.620
is that many of the
projects are in that area.

00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:15.290
It's not just meeting a need
that should already be met.

00:14:15.290 --> 00:14:19.274
It's helping a teacher be an
innovator on the front liens.

00:14:19.274 --> 00:14:21.190
DIANE SOLINGER: So we're
going to move it over

00:14:21.190 --> 00:14:22.315
to Tim for a few questions.

00:14:22.315 --> 00:14:27.286
So Tim Ferriss, best selling
author, entrepreneur,

00:14:27.286 --> 00:14:29.740
does everything in fours.

00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:31.620
We're only four people today.

00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:36.600
You joined the board
of DonorsChoose.

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:38.845
So tell us more
about your story,

00:14:38.845 --> 00:14:41.670
and why you made that choice.

00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:42.530
TIM FERRISS: Sure.

00:14:42.530 --> 00:14:44.480
So I'm on the advisory
board of DonorsChoose.

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:47.147
I have been involved
probably close to ten years

00:14:47.147 --> 00:14:49.810
now, very long time.

00:14:49.810 --> 00:14:52.250
But just as context, which
I think is important,

00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:54.530
I'm very, very
cynical of nonprofits.

00:14:54.530 --> 00:14:58.370
I think the vast majority
waste most of what

00:14:58.370 --> 00:14:59.440
they receive from donors.

00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:01.580
And you don't know
where it goes.

00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:02.614
It's sloppy.

00:15:02.614 --> 00:15:04.197
They hire people who
couldn't get jobs

00:15:04.197 --> 00:15:05.486
at for profit companies.

00:15:05.486 --> 00:15:06.360
This sounds terrible.

00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:07.070
But it's true.

00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:13.359
More so than even
the publishing,

00:15:13.359 --> 00:15:15.150
my career is investing
on this new startup.

00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:19.096
So I was pre-seed
money adviser to Uber.

00:15:19.096 --> 00:15:22.320
I think I was first advisor
to Evernote, early Twitter.

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:26.191
I mean, I apply the exact same
level of rigor and analysis

00:15:26.191 --> 00:15:27.690
to the nonprofits
that I back, which

00:15:27.690 --> 00:15:31.410
is why I support
so few nonprofits.

00:15:31.410 --> 00:15:36.270
DonorsChoose is run like a
lean, mean, aggressive, smart

00:15:36.270 --> 00:15:38.085
for profit company.

00:15:38.085 --> 00:15:42.070
And they're able to hire
talent to support that.

00:15:42.070 --> 00:15:45.495
An the story for me
goes way, way back.

00:15:45.495 --> 00:15:47.780
Because, of course, part
of vetting any startup

00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:49.990
is getting to know
the management team.

00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:52.700
I know the founder Charles
Best extremely well

00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:56.520
because we were wrestling
partners in high school.

00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:59.050
And he always beat my
sorry ass by one point

00:15:59.050 --> 00:16:00.670
for the varsity spot.

00:16:00.670 --> 00:16:02.520
So I know Charles
really, really well.

00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:04.422
DIANE SOLINGER: He's
a determined guy.

00:16:04.422 --> 00:16:07.050
TIM FERRISS: And we've
kept close for a long time.

00:16:07.050 --> 00:16:09.450
And we share very
similar values.

00:16:09.450 --> 00:16:12.054
And I think that DonorsChoose
shares a lot of similar values

00:16:12.054 --> 00:16:12.856
with most Googlers.

00:16:12.856 --> 00:16:16.965
And I've spent a lot of time
here, and at the Googleplex,

00:16:16.965 --> 00:16:20.830
and with a lot of people
who have worked for Google.

00:16:20.830 --> 00:16:24.120
DonorsChoose for me is
important for a few reasons.

00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:28.530
Number one is, a lot of people
in this room, I suspect,

00:16:28.530 --> 00:16:30.480
feel strongly about education.

00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:31.750
And perhaps you're like me.

00:16:31.750 --> 00:16:34.402
You recognize that there are few
inflection points in your life

00:16:34.402 --> 00:16:35.610
where you had an opportunity.

00:16:35.610 --> 00:16:36.940
You had a particular teacher.

00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:38.148
You had a particular project.

00:16:38.148 --> 00:16:41.470
You had a particular
type of support

00:16:41.470 --> 00:16:43.040
where you could
have gone this way.

00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:44.290
And instead you went this way.

00:16:44.290 --> 00:16:46.775
And for me, that
was especially true

00:16:46.775 --> 00:16:49.730
in second grade, fifth grade,
ninth grade, and tenth grade.

00:16:49.730 --> 00:16:52.980
I remember the exact teachers
and the exact projects.

00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:55.602
And I want to
encourage everybody.

00:16:55.602 --> 00:16:57.560
If you're king about
education, what I realized

00:16:57.560 --> 00:17:00.480
is you can't fix education
any more than you

00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:03.180
can sort of fix violence or war.

00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:04.910
You have to thin slice it.

00:17:04.910 --> 00:17:07.369
And DonorsChoose
allows you to do that.

00:17:07.369 --> 00:17:10.770
So for my case, I care about a
couple of things very deeply.

00:17:10.770 --> 00:17:13.452
I care about literacy.

00:17:13.452 --> 00:17:15.140
I care about numeracy.

00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:17.520
And I care about STEM.

00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:19.650
And even though I'm not
an engineer by training,

00:17:19.650 --> 00:17:22.950
I have a lot of the
basics, the fundamentals,

00:17:22.950 --> 00:17:29.720
of letter and number comfort
given to me through education.

00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:32.420
And that has allowed everything
that has come after this.

00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:33.480
This is cliche.

00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:35.480
But if you want to
teach people to fish

00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:38.120
and not just give
them a fish, you

00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:41.100
have to give them
the toolkit that

00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:43.560
allows them to be critical
problem solvers and creators.

00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:44.940
And you need to be literate.

00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:46.730
You need to have
numeracy for that.

00:17:46.730 --> 00:17:48.829
So what I would do
is with the help--

00:17:48.829 --> 00:17:50.620
and the only reason
I've been supporting it

00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:52.990
for 10 years instead
of 14 is because no one

00:17:52.990 --> 00:17:54.920
knew who the hell
it was 14 years ago.

00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:58.110
They needed a platform first to
really do what I wanted to do.

00:17:58.110 --> 00:18:03.230
And so I've funded projects
with the help of my readers

00:18:03.230 --> 00:18:05.820
for about 200,000
students so far.

00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:09.630
Every year, and just from
a tactical standpoint,

00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:11.430
I will choose projects
very specifically

00:18:11.430 --> 00:18:13.940
that are related to
STEM or literacy.

00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:17.320
And I'll tell people, and my
readers, go to the zip code

00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:18.150
where you grew up.

00:18:18.150 --> 00:18:20.920
Support those projects in the
schools where you grew up.

00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:23.004
If you want to fix the
problems where you grew up,

00:18:23.004 --> 00:18:24.045
I grew up on Long Island.

00:18:24.045 --> 00:18:25.870
That's like a black
hole in some places.

00:18:25.870 --> 00:18:26.745
People don't get out.

00:18:26.745 --> 00:18:28.150
People die of drug overdoses.

00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:29.077
A lot of my friends
have, because they

00:18:29.077 --> 00:18:30.031
went the other way.

00:18:30.031 --> 00:18:32.900
And I got these opportunities.

00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:36.700
And just a couple
of recommendations.

00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:40.870
Number one is look
under your seat.

00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:44.725
I have three $1,000 gift
cards to DonorsChoose.

00:18:44.725 --> 00:18:48.795
So sort of this is Willy
Wonka style for you guys.

00:18:48.795 --> 00:18:50.920
So you can check under your
seats before you leave.

00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:53.070
DIANE SOLINGER: They're
all checking now.

00:18:53.070 --> 00:18:56.320
TIM FERRISS: There's
three $1,000 gift cards.

00:18:56.320 --> 00:18:59.640
And if you found them,
if you hate kids,

00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:02.090
definitely don't use them.

00:19:02.090 --> 00:19:04.050
DIANE SOLINGER: I don't
think they hate them.

00:19:04.050 --> 00:19:06.710
TIM FERRISS: Otherwise,
please put it to use.

00:19:06.710 --> 00:19:08.129
There we go.

00:19:08.129 --> 00:19:09.521
Should be.

00:19:09.521 --> 00:19:10.021
[CHEERING]

00:19:13.332 --> 00:19:14.920
TIM FERRISS: That's
step number one.

00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:18.770
Step number two is I encourage
you, rather than perhaps

00:19:18.770 --> 00:19:21.670
developing a really
detrimental drug habit

00:19:21.670 --> 00:19:27.780
elsewhere is fund one project
on DonorsChoose, one project.

00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:30.930
Or just help a project.

00:19:30.930 --> 00:19:36.694
And it'll develop into this sort
of benevolent drug hit for you.

00:19:36.694 --> 00:19:39.110
DIANE SOLINGER: You just gave
them the first hit for free.

00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:42.070
TIM FERRISS: When I'm
having a bad day-- so

00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:45.523
what else do I look for in for
profit startups and nonprofit?

00:19:45.523 --> 00:19:47.390
I look for transparency.

00:19:47.390 --> 00:19:48.871
I look for metrics.

00:19:48.871 --> 00:19:49.870
I look forward feedback.

00:19:49.870 --> 00:19:52.627
I look for an iterative
product development loop.

00:19:52.627 --> 00:19:53.710
You guys focus on product.

00:19:53.710 --> 00:19:56.230
If I were to compare you
to anyone in my startups,

00:19:56.230 --> 00:19:57.450
I'd say yeah, Evernote.

00:19:57.450 --> 00:20:01.030
If it's $1,000 in PR,
or $1,000 in product,

00:20:01.030 --> 00:20:02.760
it's $1,000 in
product, every time.

00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:08.850
And when you fund a
project, you get feedback.

00:20:08.850 --> 00:20:12.760
So I have-- and I'm not sure
if this is the case anymore

00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:15.470
because of how you guys are
tweaking everything to scale.

00:20:15.470 --> 00:20:16.870
I think it's more digital now.

00:20:16.870 --> 00:20:19.107
But I have a drawer
full of thank

00:20:19.107 --> 00:20:21.300
you letters from teachers.

00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:24.024
And when I'm having a hard day,
when I'm just, I can't do it.

00:20:24.024 --> 00:20:25.370
God, I suck.

00:20:25.370 --> 00:20:26.220
Life is so hard.

00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:27.595
You know, just
one of those days.

00:20:27.595 --> 00:20:28.394
We all have them.

00:20:28.394 --> 00:20:29.640
I sit down.

00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:31.840
Pour myself a cup of tea.

00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:35.240
And, very San Francisco, and
read through these letters.

00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:37.900
And I swear to you,
it can help you.

00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:39.643
You will get as much
out of it as you

00:20:39.643 --> 00:20:42.820
are giving to these
teachers and these students.

00:20:42.820 --> 00:20:45.060
So that's the pitch.

00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:46.840
I don't feel like it's
even a hard pitch.

00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:49.729
Because you look at
the number of converts,

00:20:49.729 --> 00:20:52.020
these are not people who
openly endorse a lot of stuff.

00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:52.840
You've got Oprah.

00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:54.260
You've got Stephen Colbert.

00:20:54.260 --> 00:20:55.120
You've Biz Stone.

00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:58.360
You've got Michelle Obama.

00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:00.730
It's a hell of an organization.

00:21:00.730 --> 00:21:02.047
And they're very lean.

00:21:02.047 --> 00:21:03.300
They're very effective.

00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:04.994
And it's very, very specific.

00:21:04.994 --> 00:21:07.410
Because you can't boil the
ocean and try to fix education.

00:21:07.410 --> 00:21:09.660
It's too big.

00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:11.405
You need to thin slice it.

00:21:11.405 --> 00:21:13.280
Just like organizing
the world's information.

00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:15.293
Great, you can't
make that one project

00:21:15.293 --> 00:21:19.980
and put it into like a timeline.

00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:21.650
You have to create pods.

00:21:21.650 --> 00:21:25.037
And I DonorsChoose is
a very effective sort

00:21:25.037 --> 00:21:27.560
of Seal Team 6 version
if you're looking

00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:30.285
at these particular
types of projects,

00:21:30.285 --> 00:21:34.200
for me, focusing on K12.

00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:37.040
DIANE SOLINGER: So with
respect to the whole genesis

00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:38.450
of DonorsChoose.

00:21:38.450 --> 00:21:40.952
[INAUDIBLE] as a
teacher, we need things.

00:21:40.952 --> 00:21:44.300
Our classrooms are under-funded.

00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:47.980
Where is DonorsChoose getting
more involved in advocacy?

00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:50.130
I know we can't solve it all.

00:21:50.130 --> 00:21:51.400
We can't boil the ocean.

00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:53.965
But you do have advocates
like Michelle Obama

00:21:53.965 --> 00:21:55.570
saying this is great.

00:21:55.570 --> 00:21:58.310
So are you stepping into
that policy discussion

00:21:58.310 --> 00:21:59.422
more as an organization?

00:22:02.330 --> 00:22:05.480
OLIVER HURT-HILLER: Policy
and advocacy is important.

00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:06.400
It's also difficult.

00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:09.195
And it may not be-- one
of the things that's

00:22:09.195 --> 00:22:11.690
made us successful, Tim
would probably tell you,

00:22:11.690 --> 00:22:15.820
is that we're sort of focused
on doing what we do really well,

00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:17.290
and not getting too distracted.

00:22:17.290 --> 00:22:19.720
But we are excited
about the idea

00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:22.460
of having an impact
beyond just direct relief.

00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:25.810
And so to your question, one of
the things we're starting to do

00:22:25.810 --> 00:22:28.260
is dig into our data.

00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:30.610
And we now actually have
a data science team.

00:22:30.610 --> 00:22:32.170
It's two people.

00:22:32.170 --> 00:22:35.840
But that's still
unusual for a nonprofit.

00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:37.920
And our attitude is
we've got, we believe,

00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:42.150
the most innovative teachers in
the United States on our site.

00:22:42.150 --> 00:22:44.510
And they're requesting
resources for their classroom.

00:22:44.510 --> 00:22:45.650
And like I said
before, sometimes it's

00:22:45.650 --> 00:22:47.316
critical stuff they
should have already.

00:22:47.316 --> 00:22:50.410
And sometimes, often, it's
outside of the box stuff.

00:22:50.410 --> 00:22:52.310
These teachers are
ahead of the curve.

00:22:52.310 --> 00:22:54.217
And they're asking
for certain things

00:22:54.217 --> 00:22:56.425
to teach math, or certain
things to teach technology,

00:22:56.425 --> 00:22:59.565
or literacy, that they're
ahead of other teachers.

00:22:59.565 --> 00:23:01.190
And they may be ahead
of budget makers.

00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:04.590
So our first foray into
this is, and still very much

00:23:04.590 --> 00:23:10.430
at the beginning an experiment,
is to dig into that data,

00:23:10.430 --> 00:23:13.150
and say, what are our
teachers telling us?

00:23:13.150 --> 00:23:15.850
And what trends are we seeing?

00:23:15.850 --> 00:23:18.960
And I'll give you
a simple example.

00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:21.810
For a while, there's been a
long push towards, for example,

00:23:21.810 --> 00:23:22.800
Smart Boards.

00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:25.140
And Smart Boards are great.

00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:27.210
But they're also
quite expensive.

00:23:27.210 --> 00:23:29.735
And what we've seen
more often requested

00:23:29.735 --> 00:23:33.290
are what are called
ELMO projectors.

00:23:33.290 --> 00:23:34.917
It's basically the
modern overhead.

00:23:34.917 --> 00:23:37.000
So many of us grew up with
a traditional overhead.

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.500
And this is the modern one where
you can put anything on it,

00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:41.377
you can plug in your
computer, et cetera.

00:23:41.377 --> 00:23:43.460
And these are on the order
of hundreds of dollars.

00:23:43.460 --> 00:23:45.170
So this is just a
very simple example,

00:23:45.170 --> 00:23:47.370
where we see teachers
saying, well,

00:23:47.370 --> 00:23:49.310
given a choice between
these technologies,

00:23:49.310 --> 00:23:51.800
I'm going to go for
this cheaper one.

00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:55.480
And Smart Boards
are still awesome.

00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:57.560
And this can be
informative in many ways.

00:23:57.560 --> 00:23:58.890
So maybe we can impact budgets.

00:23:58.890 --> 00:24:00.630
Maybe we can impact policy.

00:24:00.630 --> 00:24:04.114
Maybe we can show
mainstream teachers

00:24:04.114 --> 00:24:06.655
what these teachers who are out
in front, what they're doing,

00:24:06.655 --> 00:24:07.929
and kind of pass that down.

00:24:07.929 --> 00:24:10.220
DIANE SOLINGER: That's kind
of what I was going to ask.

00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:11.845
TIM FERRISS: Well,
let me jump in, too.

00:24:11.845 --> 00:24:13.790
So you guys understand
the power of data.

00:24:13.790 --> 00:24:15.290
Or put a different
way, data when

00:24:15.290 --> 00:24:19.396
you're able to convert it
into meaningful information.

00:24:19.396 --> 00:24:21.020
So I'm going to take
it a step further.

00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:23.030
Hypothetically, this
is not a conversation

00:24:23.030 --> 00:24:24.590
I've had with DonorsChoose.

00:24:24.590 --> 00:24:27.428
OLIVER HURT-HILLER:
Let's do it now.

00:24:27.428 --> 00:24:32.872
TIM FERRISS: The views are my
own [INAUDIBLE] say on Twitter.

00:24:32.872 --> 00:24:34.847
Hypothetically, what happens?

00:24:34.847 --> 00:24:35.430
You have data.

00:24:35.430 --> 00:24:37.710
You have information
on what types of things

00:24:37.710 --> 00:24:39.810
are needed in which districts.

00:24:39.810 --> 00:24:41.300
OK.

00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:44.700
People, generally, in
a given county, state,

00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:46.710
they want their education
to be really good.

00:24:46.710 --> 00:24:50.350
So what happens when you have a
handful of politicians running,

00:24:50.350 --> 00:24:52.016
some of them for
re-election, and you're

00:24:52.016 --> 00:24:55.360
able to say, wow,
that district really

00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:57.310
sucks for these
following things.

00:24:57.310 --> 00:24:59.600
You're just not taking
care of your educators.

00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:03.190
And, hypothetically,
you would have the data

00:25:03.190 --> 00:25:06.130
to be able to apply,
again, this sort

00:25:06.130 --> 00:25:09.470
of karma-cly positive
pressure to say, hey,

00:25:09.470 --> 00:25:11.339
if you look at all
these 10 counties,

00:25:11.339 --> 00:25:13.380
here are the three that
are the worst performing.

00:25:13.380 --> 00:25:14.963
You want to get
re-elected, you better

00:25:14.963 --> 00:25:18.670
propose a solution
that addresses that.

00:25:18.670 --> 00:25:21.470
So it's a very powerful
data set that I

00:25:21.470 --> 00:25:26.150
think could be harnessed at some
point, hypothetically speaking.

00:25:26.150 --> 00:25:28.110
Tactically, I just
want to just touch

00:25:28.110 --> 00:25:30.390
on a couple super
tactical things.

00:25:30.390 --> 00:25:34.216
So there are a handful of really
effective nonprofits out there.

00:25:34.216 --> 00:25:38.210
If you give to any
nonprofit-- of course,

00:25:38.210 --> 00:25:40.235
I would hope that you
give a chunk, at least,

00:25:40.235 --> 00:25:44.210
to DonorsChoose.org because
they make such good use of it.

00:25:44.210 --> 00:25:46.130
A couple things,
number one is take

00:25:46.130 --> 00:25:48.830
advantage of the
matching, no-brainer.

00:25:48.830 --> 00:25:51.550
So one thing that I do every
year, I do $100,000 birthday

00:25:51.550 --> 00:25:54.205
give back, where I say,
hey, I will match up

00:25:54.205 --> 00:26:00.440
to $50,000 whatever you guys
can raise on this project page.

00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:02.739
And my readers always hit it.

00:26:02.739 --> 00:26:04.530
But how can you make
that more interesting?

00:26:04.530 --> 00:26:07.270
You can make it more
interesting if I say,

00:26:07.270 --> 00:26:12.639
instead of donating $1,000 in
cash, donate $1,000 in stock.

00:26:12.639 --> 00:26:14.930
So there are a couple different
ways that's beneficial.

00:26:14.930 --> 00:26:18.200
So you can either have
Google match, which is great.

00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:19.970
You can also, in
an ideal world--

00:26:19.970 --> 00:26:21.870
I'm not sure this is
mechanically possibly.

00:26:21.870 --> 00:26:24.610
But you donate stock,
what does that mean?

00:26:24.610 --> 00:26:28.750
So instead of selling your stock
for $100, paying $30 in tax,

00:26:28.750 --> 00:26:31.938
then donating $70, you
donate 100% of that value

00:26:31.938 --> 00:26:33.570
to the nonprofit.

00:26:33.570 --> 00:26:35.820
I never realized this until
like a year or two ago.

00:26:35.820 --> 00:26:37.410
Because people don't explain it.

00:26:37.410 --> 00:26:40.630
It's just, God, that's
such an obvious thing.

00:26:40.630 --> 00:26:42.320
And so many people
do not realize it,

00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:44.230
because it's very
seldom explained.

00:26:44.230 --> 00:26:44.997
OLIVER HURT-HILLER:
How the match

00:26:44.997 --> 00:26:46.122
would work with that, guys.

00:26:46.122 --> 00:26:48.735
Is we would match the cash
value of what you transferred.

00:26:48.735 --> 00:26:49.610
TIM FERRISS: Perfect.

00:26:49.610 --> 00:26:51.456
OLIVER HURT-HILLER: Oh, wow.

00:26:51.456 --> 00:26:52.664
DIANE SOLINGER: Up to $6,000.

00:26:52.664 --> 00:26:54.538
TIM FERRISS: So if you
have the option, then,

00:26:54.538 --> 00:26:57.860
you make the stock donation
instead of the cash donation.

00:26:57.860 --> 00:26:59.110
Why?

00:26:59.110 --> 00:27:01.820
Because not only are you
giving more to the nonprofit

00:27:01.820 --> 00:27:04.406
if you look at certain
aspects of taxation.

00:27:04.406 --> 00:27:07.870
You get 100% of the
write-off value, also.

00:27:07.870 --> 00:27:09.950
So, anyway, just
super tactically,

00:27:09.950 --> 00:27:11.510
I would say, get
depreciated stock,

00:27:11.510 --> 00:27:13.407
it's a fantastic way to go.

00:27:13.407 --> 00:27:15.740
Especially that it's going
to matched for the cash value

00:27:15.740 --> 00:27:19.959
by this wonderful organization
I've heard of called Google.

00:27:19.959 --> 00:27:21.750
DIANE SOLINGER: Final
question for you guys

00:27:21.750 --> 00:27:24.460
before we transition
a little bit.

00:27:24.460 --> 00:27:27.607
You've got this whole
network-- if you

00:27:27.607 --> 00:27:29.799
had to describe what I
am on the connectors,

00:27:29.799 --> 00:27:31.674
I always say to help
people connect together.

00:27:31.674 --> 00:27:34.610
And you've got this
network of teachers.

00:27:34.610 --> 00:27:36.070
You've got these
forward-thinking,

00:27:36.070 --> 00:27:38.560
innovative teachers,
and then maybe

00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:41.240
ones that don't
know what could be.

00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:43.240
Are you convening these folks?

00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:45.683
Or sharing the stories
amongst them more digitally?

00:27:45.683 --> 00:27:47.099
Do you have some
kind of community

00:27:47.099 --> 00:27:49.864
where they're coming together?

00:27:49.864 --> 00:27:52.030
OLIVER HURT-HILLER:
Practically, tactically speaking

00:27:52.030 --> 00:27:55.950
it happens already in the
sense that teachers will look

00:27:55.950 --> 00:27:59.880
on our site for things that
have been funded by teachers

00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:02.240
in a similar circumstance,
similar grade,

00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:04.170
similar subjects.

00:28:04.170 --> 00:28:06.030
And they'll look
there for inspiration.

00:28:06.030 --> 00:28:08.910
Like, what are they getting
for their classroom?

00:28:08.910 --> 00:28:11.380
And if the project got
funded, by how many donors,

00:28:11.380 --> 00:28:14.392
because that's revealing of
the market's sort of appetite

00:28:14.392 --> 00:28:15.600
for those sorts of projects--

00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:18.160
TIM FERRISS: Can I-- I just
want to also just chime in here.

00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:20.450
Because there's something
that is sort of so

00:28:20.450 --> 00:28:23.126
intrinsic to your DNA that
sometimes people don't get it

00:28:23.126 --> 00:28:25.580
explicitly, which is they
vet all the products.

00:28:25.580 --> 00:28:31.270
So if a teacher is like, I
need a new huge, big screen TV.

00:28:31.270 --> 00:28:32.820
This Samsung would be ideal.

00:28:32.820 --> 00:28:34.571
Like, they look into
that, and make sure--

00:28:34.571 --> 00:28:35.945
OLIVER HURT-HILLER:
That's right.

00:28:35.945 --> 00:28:39.250
We'll only ship to the school
with a bunch of things in place

00:28:39.250 --> 00:28:41.845
to make sure there's
no funny business.

00:28:41.845 --> 00:28:45.187
Remind me where we were.

00:28:45.187 --> 00:28:46.020
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:28:46.020 --> 00:28:46.903
DIANE SOLINGER: You said the
marketplace is giving you

00:28:46.903 --> 00:28:47.064
the information.

00:28:47.064 --> 00:28:49.470
OLIVER HURT-HILLER: Right,
so the teachers are already,

00:28:49.470 --> 00:28:53.440
on sort of a per project basis,
learning from each other.

00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:57.710
But I think one opportunity that
we haven't really exploited,

00:28:57.710 --> 00:29:00.460
which is real exciting
to me, is what

00:29:00.460 --> 00:29:04.960
do you do if you have the most
innovative teachers in America

00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:07.360
all on one website or service.

00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:11.459
And a lot of people have, should
I be sharing lesson plans?

00:29:11.459 --> 00:29:12.750
Should I be sharing curriculum?

00:29:12.750 --> 00:29:15.400
Should they just be supporting
each other in an emotional way?

00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:16.765
Because the truth is,
it's a lonely profession.

00:29:16.765 --> 00:29:18.980
They spend most of their days
not with their colleagues.

00:29:18.980 --> 00:29:20.285
They spend their
day with students.

00:29:20.285 --> 00:29:21.451
That's what they believe in.

00:29:21.451 --> 00:29:22.810
That's what they're there for.

00:29:22.810 --> 00:29:25.410
But they have tough days.

00:29:25.410 --> 00:29:27.110
And even some of
their best friends

00:29:27.110 --> 00:29:29.693
may not teach in the same grade,
or teach in the same subject.

00:29:29.693 --> 00:29:31.950
They may be the history
teacher at the school.

00:29:31.950 --> 00:29:34.320
Could we connect them with
other history teachers

00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:35.480
facing similar challenges?

00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:38.695
So I think we see it
as a big opportunity.

00:29:38.695 --> 00:29:39.600
And we're fortunate.

00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:43.210
A lot of sites have said, OK,
lots of teachers come here.

00:29:43.210 --> 00:29:44.460
We'll have a network effect.

00:29:44.460 --> 00:29:45.876
And then great
things will happen.

00:29:45.876 --> 00:29:48.400
But they've have a hard
time getting critical mass.

00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:49.844
And we've got the critical mass.

00:29:49.844 --> 00:29:51.635
And I think now challenge
and kind of thing

00:29:51.635 --> 00:29:53.380
we have to brainstorm
with great advisers

00:29:53.380 --> 00:29:55.943
like Time is what do we do
with that now that they're all

00:29:55.943 --> 00:29:56.443
coming here?

00:29:56.443 --> 00:29:59.106
DIANE SOLINGER: [INAUDIBLE]
product integration plan, yeah.

00:29:59.106 --> 00:30:00.100
[INAUDIBLE].

00:30:00.100 --> 00:30:01.460
Thank you.

00:30:01.460 --> 00:30:03.145
We'll be having questions later.

00:30:03.145 --> 00:30:04.710
So don't worry.

00:30:04.710 --> 00:30:06.460
But wanted to
transition a little bit.

00:30:06.460 --> 00:30:08.487
We've been talking a
lot about DonorsChoose,

00:30:08.487 --> 00:30:10.820
and things that are happening
here in the United States,

00:30:10.820 --> 00:30:12.800
and Google's involvement there.

00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:15.890
Takl a little bit now
about aple.de.ap, and what

00:30:15.890 --> 00:30:18.070
he's been doing, particularly
in The Philippines.

00:30:18.070 --> 00:30:22.455
We've got a video we're going
to show about the Aple.de.ap

00:30:22.455 --> 00:30:23.226
Foundation.

00:30:23.226 --> 00:30:24.158
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:28.750
-What would you do
for someone else?

00:30:28.750 --> 00:30:31.820
-A stranger on the
far side of the world?

00:30:31.820 --> 00:30:33.110
-Would it even matter?

00:30:33.110 --> 00:30:34.680
Would it make a difference?

00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:37.960
-What would you do
for someone else?

00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:40.990
-Growing up, aple.de.ap
was that someone,

00:30:40.990 --> 00:30:43.960
that stranger on the
far side of the world,

00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:48.360
desperately poor, barely
educated, and half blind.

00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:50.170
What could he give in return?

00:30:50.170 --> 00:30:54.500
Surely, there were better bets.

00:30:54.500 --> 00:30:56.700
Joe Ben Hudgins is
an incredible guy.

00:30:56.700 --> 00:30:59.820
When he learned about this
kid in the Philippines,

00:30:59.820 --> 00:31:01.730
he brought Apple to America.

00:31:01.730 --> 00:31:04.910
And he got him that eye surgery
that he so vitally needed.

00:31:04.910 --> 00:31:06.670
Joe adopted Apple.

00:31:06.670 --> 00:31:09.110
And Apple met Will I Am.

00:31:09.110 --> 00:31:12.780
The two formed the most unlikely
pair that you could imagine.

00:31:12.780 --> 00:31:15.505
-First time at Apple,
he was in ninth grade.

00:31:15.505 --> 00:31:17.640
He didn't speak English.

00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:19.250
I didn't really
know what to think.

00:31:19.250 --> 00:31:20.620
Because we couldn't communicate.

00:31:20.620 --> 00:31:23.740
Then we finally found a way
to talk that was just dancing.

00:31:23.740 --> 00:31:27.490
So we'd go to practice at
the rec room for hours, dude.

00:31:27.490 --> 00:31:30.460
-Then they formed a
crew, began competing.

00:31:30.460 --> 00:31:32.520
From there, through
hardship and hard work,

00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:34.450
they grew into the
Black Eyed Peas.

00:31:34.450 --> 00:31:38.780
-Because I had that other
perspective of poverty

00:31:38.780 --> 00:31:40.834

We're going to make it happen.

00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:47.730
-Soon the group rocketed
to international success,

00:31:47.730 --> 00:31:53.080
world tours, six Grammys, 56
million records sold, the World

00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:56.110
Cup, and the Super Bowl.

00:31:56.110 --> 00:31:58.520
But through it all Apple's
heart never strayed far

00:31:58.520 --> 00:31:59.720
from his homeland.

00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:01.340
In his thoughts
and in his dreams,

00:32:01.340 --> 00:32:04.470
he would turn again, and
again, wanting to help,

00:32:04.470 --> 00:32:07.870
wanting to give back, to
do what Joe taught him.

00:32:07.870 --> 00:32:09.190
Don't sit around.

00:32:09.190 --> 00:32:10.120
Do what you can.

00:32:10.120 --> 00:32:11.460
And do it now.

-You rarely meet someone who
is as caring and generous

00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:18.275
as Apple.

00:32:18.275 --> 00:32:19.400
He's always helping others.

00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:23.690
He really loves his country
so much, with his whole heart.

00:32:23.690 --> 00:32:27.140
-So Apple formed the
Aple.de.ap Foundation.

00:32:27.140 --> 00:32:30.270
And he used it to build schools.

00:32:30.270 --> 00:32:33.690
Apple built awareness,
raised funds,

00:32:33.690 --> 00:32:35.880
and joined with President
of the Philippines

00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:37.715

00:32:55.761 --> 00:32:57.260
The Aple.de.ap

00:32:57.260 --> 00:33:00.270

it makes me proud.

00:33:03.890 --> 00:33:10.210
Proud of his dedication, his
passion, how humble he is.

00:33:10.210 --> 00:33:11.250
He's done a lot.

00:33:11.250 --> 00:33:13.090
But I think Apple's
just getting started.

00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:20.450
My sincere thanks for
all you have done.

00:33:20.450 --> 00:33:22.500
I have to admit
from time to time,

00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:26.310
I like to enjoy and sometimes
dance to aple.de.ap's hip hop

00:33:26.310 --> 00:33:28.730

00:33:28.730 --> 00:33:30.750
And it certainly helps

00:33:30.750 --> 00:33:32.660
that the man singing
on the record

00:33:32.660 --> 00:33:35.220

we can make a difference.

He gave because he could.

he gave because he cared.

they might help someone
else down the road.

did Fergie get to a

It looked like she

00:34:45.414 --> 00:34:46.330
APLE.DE.AP: Thank you.

you for sharing you story,

and for doing what you're doing.

00:34:49.100 --> 00:34:50.335
It's phenomenal.

Your personal journey is
just a wonderful story.

00:34:53.530 --> 00:34:54.702
We saw it there.

00:34:54.702 --> 00:34:56.160
But just tell us
in your own words,

00:34:56.160 --> 00:34:58.700
how did you get to where you
are, and what you're doing?

00:34:58.700 --> 00:35:01.510
APLE.DE.AP: OK.

00:35:01.510 --> 00:35:04.040
First of all, thank you
for having me here today.

00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:10.359
It's always exciting, and very
informative being in Google.

00:35:10.359 --> 00:35:12.650
And I heard there's a giveaway
for them Google Glasses.

00:35:12.650 --> 00:35:15.320
Anyway.

00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:19.540
So I grew up in a
small province called

00:35:19.540 --> 00:35:23.520
Sapang Boto, Angeles
City, in the Philippines.

00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:27.970
And, you know, I
can still remember

00:35:27.970 --> 00:35:32.180
where the electric grid
wasn't even in my town yet.

00:35:32.180 --> 00:35:35.000
We were still using
kerosene and stuff.

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:40.650
And I used to tag along
with my grandfather farming,

00:35:40.650 --> 00:35:45.420
making charcoal, planting sweet
potatoes, and corns, and stuff.

00:35:49.460 --> 00:35:54.600
But what's interesting
is, we were poor.

00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:56.822
But it didn't feel like it.

00:35:56.822 --> 00:35:57.780
It didn't feel like it.

00:35:57.780 --> 00:36:01.030
Because my mom was
very resourceful.

00:36:01.030 --> 00:36:03.520
We had what you call
a sari-sari store.

00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:06.720
That means like a 7-11
in front of your house.

00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:10.740
And my Mom would
package charcoal,

00:36:10.740 --> 00:36:13.110
and make her own sashays of oil.

00:36:13.110 --> 00:36:16.625
And I'm like the delivery
boy that delivers it

00:36:16.625 --> 00:36:24.330
throughout the province, all
the little stores in my town.

00:36:24.330 --> 00:36:26.483
DIANE SOLINGER: So she was
the distribution center

00:36:26.483 --> 00:36:27.809
for all these things?

00:36:27.809 --> 00:36:29.830
APLE.DE.AP: Yeah,
I was the delivery

00:36:29.830 --> 00:36:34.850
boy to distribute the sashays
that she'd been making,

00:36:34.850 --> 00:36:36.320
and so on.

00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:41.602
And I guess she found out about
a foundation called Pearl S.

00:36:41.602 --> 00:36:45.050
Buck Foundation where they
support immigration kids.

00:36:45.050 --> 00:36:47.540
And I guess I was qualified.

00:36:47.540 --> 00:36:50.050
And, you know, I was in
one of those commercials,

00:36:50.050 --> 00:36:53.673

kid in The Philippines.

00:36:53.673 --> 00:36:57.537

shirt was really dirty.

00:37:05.522 --> 00:37:07.930
APLE.DE.AP: And then,
in return, so you

00:37:07.930 --> 00:37:12.800
get sponsors from the U.S. And
they send you school supplies.

00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:15.140
And in return, you
get to write letters.

00:37:15.140 --> 00:37:18.220
And actually show
your grades, your GPA.

00:37:20.745 --> 00:37:23.235
And that's why education
is very important.

00:37:26.292 --> 00:37:29.360
Learning English, simple
as learning English,

00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:32.450
I was able to tell
my story to my Dad.

00:37:32.450 --> 00:37:33.990
Because, you know,
of course you're

00:37:33.990 --> 00:37:38.380
supposed to impress your
sponsor to have good grades,

00:37:38.380 --> 00:37:40.270
and the mind is going
the right places.

00:37:40.270 --> 00:37:44.260
So I would always tell
stories like, Dad, you know,

00:37:44.260 --> 00:37:50.870
I'm sorry that my GPA
in math is kind of low.

00:37:50.870 --> 00:37:52.270
Because I have an eye problem.

00:37:52.270 --> 00:37:53.590
I cannot see the board.

00:37:53.590 --> 00:37:55.490
And I'm always playing
catch up, trying

00:37:55.490 --> 00:37:59.460
to copy the notes
from my classmates.

00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:03.100
So just telling him
different stories,

00:38:03.100 --> 00:38:05.030
and how hard it was
in The Philippines

00:38:05.030 --> 00:38:08.240
that he decided to adopt me.

00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:11.870
And that brought me
to the U.S. in 1989.

00:38:11.870 --> 00:38:15.950
And he was roommate
with Will i Am's uncle.

00:38:15.950 --> 00:38:20.060
So on the weekdays, he
needed a babysitter.

00:38:20.060 --> 00:38:23.000
So Will i Am's uncle's
like, well, Joe, you

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:25.427
know my sister Deborah
could take care of Alvin

00:38:25.427 --> 00:38:26.260
during the weekdays.

00:38:30.110 --> 00:38:31.750
He was a tall black man.

00:38:31.750 --> 00:38:35.750
That's why I--

00:38:35.750 --> 00:38:41.265
So and she has a kid
the same age as Allen.

00:38:41.265 --> 00:38:46.100
So now I'm living in Los Feliz
area, which is pretty cool,

00:38:46.100 --> 00:38:48.130
not the ghetto.

00:38:48.130 --> 00:38:51.761
And then they took me to East
L.A. and out to Will's house.

00:38:51.761 --> 00:38:54.710
And I'm like, yes, this
is where I want to live.

00:38:54.710 --> 00:38:58.210
Because it just had that
sense of family, and just

00:38:58.210 --> 00:39:00.130
everyone playing outside.

00:39:00.130 --> 00:39:04.870
Of course, I met Will.

00:39:08.790 --> 00:39:12.760
It was a culture shock,
coming from Philippines

00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:14.030
10,000 miles away.

00:39:14.030 --> 00:39:18.371
Now I'm in East L.A. And I'm
like, power windows, I'm like,

00:39:18.371 --> 00:39:18.870
huh!

00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:27.520
And then me and Will we're
just kind of like, you know.

00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:32.710
It's after four hours later,
finally we start conversing.

00:39:32.710 --> 00:39:38.076
He's like, so, you're
from The Philippines?

00:39:38.076 --> 00:39:41.010
It's like, yeah.

00:39:41.010 --> 00:39:43.770
So, uh.

00:39:43.770 --> 00:39:45.260
So what do you do there?

00:39:45.260 --> 00:39:46.820
What do you do there?

00:39:46.820 --> 00:39:49.122
I know how to running man.

00:39:49.122 --> 00:39:50.114
Running man.

00:39:50.114 --> 00:39:52.562
He's like you know how
to do the running man all

00:39:52.562 --> 00:39:53.770
the way from the Philippines?

00:39:53.770 --> 00:39:58.200
I hope you didn't run from the
Philippines all the way here.

00:39:58.200 --> 00:40:02.300
So from that conversation, we
just shared the same interests.

00:40:02.300 --> 00:40:04.300
Like, yeah, I break dance too.

00:40:04.300 --> 00:40:10.680
And then we formed a dance
group called Tribal Nation.

00:40:10.680 --> 00:40:12.760
And we were 16, 17.

00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:15.950
So all we could do was go
to Filipino house parties.

00:40:15.950 --> 00:40:19.865
And get shot up.

00:40:19.865 --> 00:40:20.364
Ah!

00:40:20.364 --> 00:40:21.292
Time to go home.

00:40:24.540 --> 00:40:28.025
And then, of course,
we had a dance group.

00:40:28.025 --> 00:40:29.250
We were battling everyone.

00:40:29.250 --> 00:40:30.576
Like, yeah, you want it?

00:40:30.576 --> 00:40:31.075
You want it?

00:40:31.075 --> 00:40:31.827
Yeah!

00:40:31.827 --> 00:40:32.781
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:34.690 --> 00:40:37.210
So we were kind of
running this scene.

00:40:37.210 --> 00:40:41.570
And then a friend of hours was
like, yo, you guys ain't sh!

00:40:41.570 --> 00:40:44.981
You guys ain't nothing
until you go to Hollywood.

00:40:44.981 --> 00:40:47.416
We're like, oh, yeah, Hollywood?

00:40:47.416 --> 00:40:48.035
All right.

00:40:48.035 --> 00:40:50.140
So we started
going to Hollywood.

00:40:50.140 --> 00:40:53.230
And started joining
dance contests,

00:40:53.230 --> 00:40:56.050
and MC battles and stuff.

00:40:56.050 --> 00:41:02.800
And one day Eazy
E's A&amp;R was there.

00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:05.891
You know, Eazy E from NWA.

00:41:05.891 --> 00:41:09.190
He had his A&amp;&amp;R come
just scouting and stuff.

00:41:09.190 --> 00:41:12.480
So his A&amp;R saw us.

00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:16.230
And he's like, yo,
you guys got a demo?

00:41:16.230 --> 00:41:17.670
Let's have a meeting.

00:41:17.670 --> 00:41:20.724
My boss is Easy E, NWA.

00:41:20.724 --> 00:41:21.652
It's like, yeah?

00:41:21.652 --> 00:41:22.580
All right.

00:41:22.580 --> 00:41:25.030
All right.

00:41:25.030 --> 00:41:29.440
So long story short, we
got signed to Eazy E.

00:41:29.440 --> 00:41:31.340
And then he passed away.

00:41:31.340 --> 00:41:34.670
We couldn't use that
album, our own names,

00:41:34.670 --> 00:41:43.010
because of whatever--
for contract reasons.

00:41:43.010 --> 00:41:44.990
So Eazy E passed away in '95.

00:41:44.990 --> 00:41:48.233
And then we started
Black Eyed Peas.

00:41:48.233 --> 00:41:53.640
And just kept doing
shows, shows, shows.

00:41:53.640 --> 00:41:59.980
Back then, there was no email,
no Twitter, no Facebook.

00:41:59.980 --> 00:42:06.723
So then we would chuck our
demos to the record companies.

00:42:06.723 --> 00:42:10.920
We were more into Tribe
Called Quest, break dancing.

00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:12.430
It was more positive.

00:42:12.430 --> 00:42:16.760
And L.A. back in the days was
more like, NWA, all gangster

00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:19.110
music.

00:42:19.110 --> 00:42:22.492
So the record companies didn't
think it was tangible enough.

00:42:22.492 --> 00:42:24.380
DIANE SOLINGER: So
along the way, though,

00:42:24.380 --> 00:42:25.796
because we've got an hour--

00:42:25.796 --> 00:42:29.699
APLE.DE.AP: So anyway, so we
started our own following.

00:42:29.699 --> 00:42:31.240
We started our own
following And then

00:42:31.240 --> 00:42:32.994
Black Eyed Peas came about.

00:42:32.994 --> 00:42:35.990
And then finally
after a decade later,

00:42:35.990 --> 00:42:37.990
I was able to go back home.

00:42:37.990 --> 00:42:41.480
And then I just started
seeing the discrepancy

00:42:41.480 --> 00:42:44.755
of the education
compared to the U.S.

00:42:44.755 --> 00:42:47.380
and all the kids
in my neighborhood.

00:42:47.380 --> 00:42:49.170
So we would go on holidays.

00:42:49.170 --> 00:42:51.120
And I'm like, yo, what
are these kids doing?

00:42:51.120 --> 00:42:54.800
They're just like running
around doing nothing.

00:42:54.800 --> 00:43:00.050
So I came up with the
idea, one night, I

00:43:00.050 --> 00:43:04.062
was researching in
the club, researching,

00:43:04.062 --> 00:43:05.384
and then I called my Mom.

00:43:05.384 --> 00:43:06.050
I was like, Mom!

00:43:06.050 --> 00:43:07.992
I got a great idea!

00:43:07.992 --> 00:43:09.200
I need you to buy a building!

00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:10.825
And I'm going to go
home for Christmas!

00:43:10.825 --> 00:43:12.800
And bring 25 laptops!

00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:14.322
And all the kids
in the neighborhood

00:43:14.322 --> 00:43:20.120
can go and learn how to
like-- just learn computers.

00:43:20.120 --> 00:43:26.520
And then, it's like,
Allan, son, are you drunk?

00:43:26.520 --> 00:43:28.290
I was like, Mom, I
was researching, OK?

00:43:28.290 --> 00:43:29.359
I was researching.

00:43:29.359 --> 00:43:29.900
And, anyways.

00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:40.709
So we built the first computer
labs in my town, Angeles City.

00:43:40.709 --> 00:43:41.500
It had 25 desktops.

00:43:41.500 --> 00:43:44.750
And I come back
six months later.

00:43:44.750 --> 00:43:49.190
And these kids are like
editing their own videos,

00:43:49.190 --> 00:43:52.430
taking courses online.

00:43:52.430 --> 00:43:54.010
They're GPAs had gone up.

00:43:54.010 --> 00:43:58.400
And now they're qualified
to go to university.

00:43:58.400 --> 00:44:03.540
So with anything that
is on the video, Grammys

00:44:03.540 --> 00:44:06.320
or anything like that,
this is more gratifying

00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:10.985
than anything is to be able
to help another person.

00:44:14.750 --> 00:44:16.220
So we've been
building classrooms

00:44:16.220 --> 00:44:17.650
for about three years now.

00:44:17.650 --> 00:44:22.280
We have over 40 classrooms
throughout Philippines.

00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:25.670
But, you know, about a
year ago, Typhoon Yolanda

00:44:25.670 --> 00:44:26.910
hit The Philippines.

00:44:26.910 --> 00:44:31.550
And we had to do
a different turn.

00:44:31.550 --> 00:44:34.900
And now we're doing a
music and art therapy

00:44:34.900 --> 00:44:36.180
program for the kids.

00:44:36.180 --> 00:44:38.857
Because they're traumatized.

00:44:38.857 --> 00:44:40.065
They have separation anxiety.

00:44:40.065 --> 00:44:42.110
They don't want to go to school.

00:44:42.110 --> 00:44:44.760
So we try to make it more fun.

00:44:44.760 --> 00:44:46.880
So we have a teacher's
teaching program

00:44:46.880 --> 00:44:49.275
to teach the kids
through music and art

00:44:49.275 --> 00:44:52.310
to make it fun and enticing
to go back to school again.

00:44:56.510 --> 00:45:04.440
And, of course, beyond
that, I have 14 scholars.

00:45:08.330 --> 00:45:10.350
And one of them
is valedictorian.

00:45:10.350 --> 00:45:12.390
And they're on the
top two percentile.

00:45:12.390 --> 00:45:16.780
So I'm always like, what's next?

00:45:16.780 --> 00:45:19.160
What's next for these kids?

00:45:19.160 --> 00:45:20.380
Of course, to find jobs.

00:45:20.380 --> 00:45:24.750
So hopefully I'll get some
volunteers from Google

00:45:24.750 --> 00:45:26.980
to mentor these
kids to find jobs,

00:45:26.980 --> 00:45:31.220
and, of course,
to have a career.

00:45:31.220 --> 00:45:31.720
What else?

00:45:31.720 --> 00:45:33.595
DIANE SOLINGER: You're
pretty nimble, though.

00:45:33.595 --> 00:45:35.100
I think you went
back-- well, when

00:45:35.100 --> 00:45:36.475
you were doing
your research, you

00:45:36.475 --> 00:45:38.670
saw that there was
something you could fill,

00:45:38.670 --> 00:45:39.790
like build a school.

00:45:39.790 --> 00:45:41.218
Then it moved to classrooms.

00:45:41.218 --> 00:45:44.910
Then it now is thinking, how
do we support the whole kids?

00:45:44.910 --> 00:45:46.356
Thinking about their wellness.

00:45:46.356 --> 00:45:49.490
And now the future is jobs.

00:45:49.490 --> 00:45:50.927
So it's kind of
a whole continuum

00:45:50.927 --> 00:45:53.552
that you're looking at with your
foundation, which is terrific.

00:45:53.552 --> 00:45:56.810
APLE.DE.AP: Yeah,
you know, coming in.

00:45:56.810 --> 00:46:00.030
Thanks to my
management and my team,

00:46:00.030 --> 00:46:03.184
they're teaching about
scaling, like scaling it up.

00:46:03.184 --> 00:46:04.683
DIANE SOLINGER:
This is a good place

00:46:04.683 --> 00:46:05.766
to learn about scale, too.

00:46:05.766 --> 00:46:10.115
APLE.DE.AP: Yeah, so that's
where we at right now.

00:46:10.115 --> 00:46:12.960
And really just thinking
of sustaining it,

00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:18.500
and keeping it moving, and have
somewhere to go for these kids

00:46:18.500 --> 00:46:19.110
after.

00:46:19.110 --> 00:46:23.480
My big dream is to have
an academy at the end.

00:46:23.480 --> 00:46:25.720
So everyone could
go to this academy,

00:46:25.720 --> 00:46:31.200
and learn coding,
learn how to-- I mean,

00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:34.269
Curious George is
made in Philippines.

00:46:34.269 --> 00:46:36.598
So imagine given
an oppotrunity--

00:46:36.598 --> 00:46:38.181
DIANE SOLINGER: You
need a yellow hat.

00:46:38.181 --> 00:46:41.120
The man with the yellow hat.

00:46:41.120 --> 00:46:44.430
APLE.DE.AP: So that's
where we at right now.

00:46:44.430 --> 00:46:46.390
That's where the foundation is.

00:46:46.390 --> 00:46:49.870
And just really
coming over here,

00:46:49.870 --> 00:46:52.320
I want to really
collaborate with everyone.

00:46:52.320 --> 00:46:53.430
Give me ideas.

00:46:53.430 --> 00:46:58.210
And I'm very transparent, too.

00:46:58.210 --> 00:47:01.800
Just like you said earlier, I
like to see it happen hands on.

00:47:01.800 --> 00:47:04.853
Because if I don't,
I lose motivation.

00:47:04.853 --> 00:47:07.353
DIANE SOLINGER: I think that's
something a lot of volunteers

00:47:07.353 --> 00:47:08.680
look for, too.

00:47:08.680 --> 00:47:10.840
When we're
volunteering or giving,

00:47:10.840 --> 00:47:14.280
we want to understand that
we're having an impact.

00:47:14.280 --> 00:47:16.521
And both organizations
are trying

00:47:16.521 --> 00:47:18.030
demonstrate that and share that.

00:47:18.030 --> 00:47:19.780
But you're also good
at bringing in people

00:47:19.780 --> 00:47:21.504
and having ideas,
which is great.

00:47:21.504 --> 00:47:25.380
I don't know if a lot of people
know-- we've got Jimmy here.

00:47:25.380 --> 00:47:28.552
But several Googlers-- what was
it a cohort of about 15, 16?

00:47:28.552 --> 00:47:32.835
AUDIENCE: It was 16 volunteers,
and then four Googlers leading.

00:47:32.835 --> 00:47:35.410
DIANE SOLINGER: So 20 Googlers
went to The Philippines

00:47:35.410 --> 00:47:40.060
not too long ago to do a Google
REACH program, three and a half

00:47:40.060 --> 00:47:43.023
weeks, and working on
pro bono volunteering.

00:47:43.023 --> 00:47:44.356
So think about things like that.

00:47:44.356 --> 00:47:45.490
In your own
volunteer experience,

00:47:45.490 --> 00:47:47.070
if you want to go
for a deep dive,

00:47:47.070 --> 00:47:50.230
that will probably happen again.

00:47:50.230 --> 00:47:52.870
And then we have
Google REACH in Delhi,

00:47:52.870 --> 00:47:54.990
and coming up in Accra, Ghana.

00:47:54.990 --> 00:47:57.490
And we do REACH local,
which is wrapping up

00:47:57.490 --> 00:48:01.040
this week in the Bay
Area and in Seattle.

00:48:01.040 --> 00:48:02.940
This week it's been
focused on education.

00:48:02.940 --> 00:48:05.700
So you can do a deep dive
with an education organization

00:48:05.700 --> 00:48:08.170
in your background.

00:48:08.170 --> 00:48:09.760
But, again, go to
go/googlersgive

00:48:09.760 --> 00:48:10.880
for some of those ideas.

00:48:10.880 --> 00:48:13.115
If you want to get involved.

00:48:13.115 --> 00:48:15.440
I think we should
open to all of you.

00:48:15.440 --> 00:48:17.707
Are there questions
out in the audience?

00:48:17.707 --> 00:48:19.915
AUDIENCE: Thanks for coming,
really insightful stuff.

00:48:19.915 --> 00:48:21.322
I appreciate your time.

00:48:21.322 --> 00:48:23.780
So I guess I'm wondering-- you
talked a little bit about it

00:48:23.780 --> 00:48:26.292
already-- but networking.

00:48:26.292 --> 00:48:27.750
So one of the most
important things

00:48:27.750 --> 00:48:30.900
that I think is a big part of
why we're successful at Google

00:48:30.900 --> 00:48:34.330
is because we're very good at
sharing knowledge, and passing

00:48:34.330 --> 00:48:36.440
learnings along from
organization to organization.

00:48:36.440 --> 00:48:39.650
So you talked a little bit about
how teachers can proactively

00:48:39.650 --> 00:48:43.140
go and check out what other
projects are being funded,

00:48:43.140 --> 00:48:44.300
and that sort of thing.

00:48:44.300 --> 00:48:47.360
But is there anything
to kind of preemptively

00:48:47.360 --> 00:48:49.990
push that type of
behavior on to teachers?

00:48:49.990 --> 00:48:52.260
And is there
anything that you can

00:48:52.260 --> 00:48:55.906
do to kind of encourage that so
that these people are talking?

00:48:55.906 --> 00:48:57.405
And they could see
what's successful

00:48:57.405 --> 00:49:01.415
and what's not to kind of
help set them up for success?

00:49:01.415 --> 00:49:03.248
OLIVER HURST-HILLER: I
think to some degree,

00:49:03.248 --> 00:49:04.130
we touched on this.

00:49:04.130 --> 00:49:06.300
I think maybe we can
do this with our data.

00:49:06.300 --> 00:49:08.420
But we're still at
very early stages.

00:49:08.420 --> 00:49:10.830
I think maybe we can do
it with all these teachers

00:49:10.830 --> 00:49:12.109
that are coming to our site.

00:49:12.109 --> 00:49:14.650
And by the way, when we email
them, they're paying attention.

00:49:14.650 --> 00:49:17.539
Because it often has
to do with funds,

00:49:17.539 --> 00:49:18.830
resources for their classrooms.

00:49:18.830 --> 00:49:20.540
So we have their attention.

00:49:20.540 --> 00:49:23.520
So I think there's a
lot of opportunity there

00:49:23.520 --> 00:49:25.170
that's untapped.

00:49:25.170 --> 00:49:27.855
One thing I will say in terms
of sharing and knowledge

00:49:27.855 --> 00:49:30.590
dissemination that
I'm super excited

00:49:30.590 --> 00:49:33.990
is that-- I spent my career
prior to DonorsChoose.org

00:49:33.990 --> 00:49:38.230
in the for profit commercial
internet software sector.

00:49:38.230 --> 00:49:39.776
Companies collaborate
on some things.

00:49:39.776 --> 00:49:44.690
But there's just a lot you can't
share for competitive reasons.

00:49:44.690 --> 00:49:47.470
And one of the great things
about working in this sector

00:49:47.470 --> 00:49:49.929
is that organizations I
think are much quicker

00:49:49.929 --> 00:49:50.970
to share with each other.

00:49:50.970 --> 00:49:54.180
So just last week,
we had a gathering

00:49:54.180 --> 00:49:56.985
that we do once a year
of the CTOs of some

00:49:56.985 --> 00:49:58.485
of the most innovative,
tech forward

00:49:58.485 --> 00:50:00.750
nonprofits in the country.

00:50:00.750 --> 00:50:02.214
We did it last year in New York.

00:50:02.214 --> 00:50:03.630
This year it was
in San Francisco.

00:50:03.630 --> 00:50:07.335
It's us, and Kiva, and
Global Giving, and Wikimedia.

00:50:07.335 --> 00:50:08.585
They run a really big website.

00:50:08.585 --> 00:50:11.640
It's called [INAUDIBLE]
pretty popular.

00:50:11.640 --> 00:50:15.590
And Charity: Water,
and Common Sense Media,

00:50:15.590 --> 00:50:17.017
which is also based here.

00:50:17.017 --> 00:50:17.850
And we get together.

00:50:17.850 --> 00:50:22.150
And we spend two days just
totally sharing everything.

00:50:22.150 --> 00:50:23.870
What are your
toughest challenges?

00:50:23.870 --> 00:50:25.830
What technologies are you using?

00:50:25.830 --> 00:50:27.610
How are you collaborating
with other orgs?

00:50:27.610 --> 00:50:30.040
And I just get so much from it.

00:50:30.040 --> 00:50:31.785
Our org gets so
much fun from it.

00:50:31.785 --> 00:50:34.330
And this is just only
possible in our sector.

00:50:34.330 --> 00:50:37.920
Because there's this feeling
of we're not competing.

00:50:37.920 --> 00:50:40.060
We all have a
similar motivation.

00:50:40.060 --> 00:50:43.940
And that's actually
inspired what

00:50:43.940 --> 00:50:48.000
we call CMOs for good, which
is the marketing folks.

00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:49.430
And now we've got COOs for good.

00:50:49.430 --> 00:50:51.221
So now we've got all
the head of operations

00:50:51.221 --> 00:50:53.890
at these different orgs
talking and sharing.

00:50:53.890 --> 00:50:57.192
So, to me, that's a
level up from what

00:50:57.192 --> 00:50:58.900
you asked about in
terms of the teachers.

00:50:58.900 --> 00:51:02.100
But I think it's exciting
in terms of a rising tide,

00:51:02.100 --> 00:51:04.944
just us not having to make all
the same mistakes on our own,

00:51:04.944 --> 00:51:06.240
and learning from each other.

00:51:06.240 --> 00:51:08.448
DIANE SOLINGER: Intersting,
though, the organizations

00:51:08.448 --> 00:51:10.755
you mentioned you mentioned
are all pretty new.

00:51:10.755 --> 00:51:14.424
So I was in the nonprofit
sector for over 25 years.

00:51:14.424 --> 00:51:16.590
A lot of those organizations
that I used to work for

00:51:16.590 --> 00:51:18.645
would not have thought
about that collaboration

00:51:18.645 --> 00:51:19.780
that you're thinking about.

00:51:19.780 --> 00:51:21.080
And that's what's really
going to make the impact.

00:51:21.080 --> 00:51:22.143
It's so good to hear.

00:51:22.143 --> 00:51:24.830
TIM FERRISS: Just to add to
that, if I could real fast.

00:51:24.830 --> 00:51:26.220
There are kind of two
levels of collaboration,

00:51:26.220 --> 00:51:28.428
the CTO to CTO, which is
organization to organization

00:51:28.428 --> 00:51:30.105
collab is really important.

00:51:30.105 --> 00:51:32.820
But I think the-- more
when I met with Charles

00:51:32.820 --> 00:51:38.204
along with Scott
of Charity: Water,

00:51:38.204 --> 00:51:40.120
I thought that they could
trade, for instance,

00:51:40.120 --> 00:51:43.320
their pairing of
birthday gift bags,

00:51:43.320 --> 00:51:47.380
which Charity: Water was very
good at with DonorsChoose'

00:51:47.380 --> 00:51:49.842
ability to get corporate
support, which can just

00:51:49.842 --> 00:51:51.660
be just be a force multiplier.

00:51:51.660 --> 00:51:55.790
On the teacher-- just as a
donor, this might be helpful.

00:51:55.790 --> 00:51:59.910
What I've seen is the planned,
and then the organic plan,

00:51:59.910 --> 00:52:02.642
I think you guys do
a very job of email,

00:52:02.642 --> 00:52:04.880
of utilizing the
database of emails,

00:52:04.880 --> 00:52:07.010
which includes a
lot of teachers.

00:52:07.010 --> 00:52:11.100
Second would be, I think
a lot of the collaboration

00:52:11.100 --> 00:52:14.180
could be accomplished very
easily, for instance, not

00:52:14.180 --> 00:52:15.330
necessarily through reddit.

00:52:15.330 --> 00:52:17.410
But reddit's been
a huge supporter.

00:52:17.410 --> 00:52:19.410
And I think that you
could very easily see it,

00:52:19.410 --> 00:52:20.610
if it's not already there.

00:52:20.610 --> 00:52:21.630
I mean, every time,
I'm like, oh, I

00:52:21.630 --> 00:52:23.171
should create a
subreddit about blah,

00:52:23.171 --> 00:52:25.230
it's like there are
already 12 of them.

00:52:25.230 --> 00:52:30.014
So I would be surprised if
they don't already exist.

00:52:30.014 --> 00:52:31.930
But if they don't, it
would actually, I think,

00:52:31.930 --> 00:52:35.360
very easy to thin
slice into my subject

00:52:35.360 --> 00:52:40.369
to stay both on
something like reddit.

00:52:40.369 --> 00:52:41.410
DIANE SOLINGER: Question?

00:52:44.135 --> 00:52:46.465
AUDIENCE: First, I wanted
to thank the Give team

00:52:46.465 --> 00:52:47.862
for bringing the panelists.

00:52:47.862 --> 00:52:52.281
I love that this a
spectrum of the world.

00:52:52.281 --> 00:52:54.736
So we're looking
at The Philippines,

00:52:54.736 --> 00:52:58.405
and what's being done here in
the U.S. But what I also love

00:52:58.405 --> 00:53:00.821
is the spectrum of the startup
and established foundation.

00:53:00.821 --> 00:53:06.068
So my question, which I'd love
for all of you to address,

00:53:06.068 --> 00:53:08.887
is how you see-- a
lot of times with we

00:53:08.887 --> 00:53:10.220
come to these summits and talks.

00:53:10.220 --> 00:53:10.580
And we're inspired.

00:53:10.580 --> 00:53:12.292
And we want to take
things forward.

00:53:12.292 --> 00:53:15.965
But how do each of you,
like now meeting each other

00:53:15.965 --> 00:53:20.310
for the first time, plan
to bring it forward?

00:53:20.310 --> 00:53:24.490
Like, what can the Philippines
learn from you, and vice versa?

00:53:28.640 --> 00:53:29.605
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:53:31.540 --> 00:53:33.790
AUDIENCE: I know that you
guys are nationally focused.

00:53:33.790 --> 00:53:35.248
But I also look at
you as like, OK,

00:53:35.248 --> 00:53:36.874
you're a grownup foundation.

00:53:36.874 --> 00:53:38.790
And so there's a lot
that a startup foundation

00:53:38.790 --> 00:53:39.581
can learn from you.

00:53:39.581 --> 00:53:43.063
And vice versa, if
you're looking to expand,

00:53:43.063 --> 00:53:45.320
potentially globally.

00:53:45.320 --> 00:53:48.095
OLIVER HURST-HILLER:
I'll say that we are not.

00:53:48.095 --> 00:53:50.810
And that sort of comes
back to our focus.

00:53:50.810 --> 00:53:55.354
And also the challenge of
inequity in American education

00:53:55.354 --> 00:53:56.790
is really large.

00:53:56.790 --> 00:53:59.370
So we have plenty
of work to do here.

00:53:59.370 --> 00:54:03.220
I think one of the cool
things for nonprofits and orgs

00:54:03.220 --> 00:54:08.010
like Apple's are that, 14 years
ago when Charles had this idea,

00:54:08.010 --> 00:54:11.666
he had to build the
whole thing from scratch.

00:54:11.666 --> 00:54:15.110
And now, you don't
necessarily have to.

00:54:15.110 --> 00:54:18.140
There's like white label,
crowdfunding platforms

00:54:18.140 --> 00:54:19.265
out there.

00:54:19.265 --> 00:54:22.356
And there's a
whole mess of them.

00:54:22.356 --> 00:54:27.640
And also, I think a trend
is happening-- I'm biased.

00:54:27.640 --> 00:54:29.815
But my experience is that
once you give in this way,

00:54:29.815 --> 00:54:33.660
whether it's Kiva, or Globa
Giving, or us, or Kickstarter,

00:54:33.660 --> 00:54:37.014
Indigo, once you have that level
of choice, and accountability,

00:54:37.014 --> 00:54:38.430
and transparency,
it's really hard

00:54:38.430 --> 00:54:40.570
to give another way,
like the old school,

00:54:40.570 --> 00:54:41.810
throw it over the wall.

00:54:41.810 --> 00:54:43.530
And, well, we agree
at the headline level

00:54:43.530 --> 00:54:43.885
about the mission.

00:54:43.885 --> 00:54:46.050
I'm going to I throw
this money over the wall.

00:54:46.050 --> 00:54:49.320
So I think the good news.

00:54:49.320 --> 00:54:51.545
There's now pressure on
foundations and nonprofits

00:54:51.545 --> 00:54:54.150
to offer micro
giving opportunities,

00:54:54.150 --> 00:54:57.380
and that sort of, Tim's
language, thin sliced ways

00:54:57.380 --> 00:54:57.880
to target.

00:54:57.880 --> 00:54:59.671
But I think the good
news is now it doesn't

00:54:59.671 --> 00:55:01.870
mean everybody has to run
out, and like us, have

00:55:01.870 --> 00:55:03.980
a product and
engineering team of 16.

00:55:03.980 --> 00:55:07.450
There's now turnkey posted
products out there where

00:55:07.450 --> 00:55:09.110
you can then take
your opportunities.

00:55:09.110 --> 00:55:12.554
So maybe one thing, not
to put them on the spot,

00:55:12.554 --> 00:55:14.720
but maybe one thing their
organization could look at

00:55:14.720 --> 00:55:17.660
is giving donors
a way to target.

00:55:17.660 --> 00:55:20.690
Because we know that
appeals to donors.

00:55:20.690 --> 00:55:22.690
AUDIENCE: I just had one more.

00:55:22.690 --> 00:55:24.375
Music education is
really close to me.

00:55:24.375 --> 00:55:26.924
I was actually a music teacher
before I started [INAUDIBLE]

00:55:26.924 --> 00:55:30.700
and got sucked
into the dark side.

00:55:30.700 --> 00:55:33.110
But I think this is wonderful.

00:55:33.110 --> 00:55:35.514
I've been a member
of DonorsChoose

00:55:35.514 --> 00:55:37.690
since I saw it on
Colbert a few years ago.

00:55:37.690 --> 00:55:40.670
And I've contributed a bunch of
different, like local schools

00:55:40.670 --> 00:55:43.270
that have things like--
I contribute some money,

00:55:43.270 --> 00:55:45.219
and say, oh, they seem far away.

00:55:45.219 --> 00:55:46.760
But I'm very happy
to say that Google

00:55:46.760 --> 00:55:48.926
came through and finished
like the last two projects

00:55:48.926 --> 00:55:54.312
for us like [INAUDIBLE] and
instruments for small kids.

00:55:54.312 --> 00:55:55.687
But I wanted to
know, do you have

00:55:55.687 --> 00:55:57.785
an initiative for
music and arts?

00:55:57.785 --> 00:56:00.358
It's really taken a hit in
the last 10 years in all

00:56:00.358 --> 00:56:01.998
the schools. [INAUDIBLE].

00:56:01.998 --> 00:56:07.410
Do you have a particular
initiative that you focus on?

00:56:07.410 --> 00:56:09.378
OLIVER HURST-HILLER:
We tend to look

00:56:09.378 --> 00:56:10.838
to the-- we're not prescriptive.

00:56:10.838 --> 00:56:11.838
We look to the teachers.

00:56:11.838 --> 00:56:14.320
And say, you tell
us what you need.

00:56:14.320 --> 00:56:16.450
That said, teachers
are influenced

00:56:16.450 --> 00:56:18.590
by the matching
dollars out there.

00:56:18.590 --> 00:56:21.230
So when, for example,
orgs like Google

00:56:21.230 --> 00:56:24.960
say, hey we want to focus
on STEM, teachers will say,

00:56:24.960 --> 00:56:26.450
well, that's motivational to me.

00:56:26.450 --> 00:56:29.070
Because I'd love to
activate this match.

00:56:29.070 --> 00:56:31.690
And so you can sort of
draw attention to the area.

00:56:31.690 --> 00:56:35.220
And it's absolutely the case
that music, and visual arts,

00:56:35.220 --> 00:56:38.130
and performing arts, everybody
knows they're kind of the first

00:56:38.130 --> 00:56:40.510
to get cut when times get tight.

00:56:40.510 --> 00:56:42.460
And so we see a lot
of those projects

00:56:42.460 --> 00:56:44.310
on the site sort of evergreen.

00:56:44.310 --> 00:56:50.370
So if you guys ever want
to get behind projects

00:56:50.370 --> 00:56:53.247
in the performing arts,
visual arts, music,

00:56:53.247 --> 00:56:55.330
they're always on there
at different grade levels,

00:56:55.330 --> 00:56:56.246
different need levels.

00:56:58.712 --> 00:57:00.140
I think the good
news and bad news

00:57:00.140 --> 00:57:01.848
there is that we're
probably always going

00:57:01.848 --> 00:57:03.440
to have those
projects on our site.

00:57:03.440 --> 00:57:07.365
Because it does seem
to be-- everybody

00:57:07.365 --> 00:57:09.364
believes it's so
important to education.

00:57:09.364 --> 00:57:11.113
But it's also sort of
the first to get cut

00:57:11.113 --> 00:57:11.988
when times get tight.

00:57:11.988 --> 00:57:15.244
AUDIENCE: I think some of those
voices are missing. [INAUDIBLE]

00:57:15.244 --> 00:57:17.505
and those programs are done.

00:57:17.505 --> 00:57:19.933
So that's why I'm
saying that maybe we

00:57:19.933 --> 00:57:22.921
should organize something
that puts it back.

00:57:22.921 --> 00:57:25.420
DIANE SOLINGER: I think there's
an opportunity for all of us

00:57:25.420 --> 00:57:29.380
to be change agents
ourselves, right?

00:57:29.380 --> 00:57:31.180
And we've got our
networks within Google,

00:57:31.180 --> 00:57:33.480
and outside of Google.

00:57:33.480 --> 00:57:36.425
And everybody can
be a philanthropist.

00:57:36.425 --> 00:57:39.920
You don't have to be
$100,000 birthday match

00:57:39.920 --> 00:57:41.740
to make that happen.

00:57:41.740 --> 00:57:44.070
You can swipe your badge.

00:57:44.070 --> 00:57:47.882
You can get other
people to join you.

00:57:47.882 --> 00:57:48.715
So think about that.

00:57:48.715 --> 00:57:51.140
Towards the end of this
year, first week of December,

00:57:51.140 --> 00:57:54.680
many of our offices in
all of Mountain View

00:57:54.680 --> 00:57:57.300
will be participating in
a program called G Give.

00:57:57.300 --> 00:57:59.240
And in the month of
October, Googlers

00:57:59.240 --> 00:58:02.920
will be invited to put forth
their organization that they

00:58:02.920 --> 00:58:04.465
love, and share
their story about why

00:58:04.465 --> 00:58:05.590
you love that organization.

00:58:05.590 --> 00:58:08.680
And say, I'm going to sponsor
that organizations for a day.

00:58:08.680 --> 00:58:11.589
And if you give to that
organization that day,

00:58:11.589 --> 00:58:12.672
then Google will match it.

00:58:12.672 --> 00:58:15.167
And I will match it up
to a certain amount.

00:58:15.167 --> 00:58:18.670
So October starts this
nomination process.

00:58:18.670 --> 00:58:20.159
It won't be totally global.

00:58:20.159 --> 00:58:21.700
Because for us to
gift match globally

00:58:21.700 --> 00:58:23.290
is a little bit challenging.

00:58:23.290 --> 00:58:26.330
But it's going to be in
43 teams and offices.

00:58:26.330 --> 00:58:29.470
And all of Mountain View
Bay Area will be covered.

00:58:29.470 --> 00:58:31.840
And look for those messages
coming out in October.

00:58:31.840 --> 00:58:32.940
If you have a charity that
you're really interested in,

00:58:32.940 --> 00:58:34.840
and an organization
or cause around,

00:58:34.840 --> 00:58:38.650
let's say, the music and
arts, put that forth.

00:58:38.650 --> 00:58:40.895
And people will decide
in a democratic way

00:58:40.895 --> 00:58:43.490
if that's one of the featured
organizations for the week.

00:58:43.490 --> 00:58:46.430
And then you can bring
others into the fold

00:58:46.430 --> 00:58:48.152
in the first week
of December when

00:58:48.152 --> 00:58:50.802
the G Give campaigns happen.

00:58:50.802 --> 00:58:52.510
TIM FERRISS: Just to
reiterate something.

00:58:52.510 --> 00:58:54.343
It's not about the
amount of money you give.

00:58:54.343 --> 00:58:56.680
It's about seeing the
direct result of the dollars

00:58:56.680 --> 00:58:58.672
that you choose to put in.

00:58:58.672 --> 00:59:02.158
So I think, whether it's
Apple's organization,

00:59:02.158 --> 00:59:04.767
or DonorsChoose.org,
just see if you

00:59:04.767 --> 00:59:08.340
can find a specific initiative
that reminds you of a teacher

00:59:08.340 --> 00:59:12.340
or class that led you to doing
this as opposed to flat lining

00:59:12.340 --> 00:59:14.910
or dropping like I'm
sure people have seen

00:59:14.910 --> 00:59:16.717
their classmates suffer from.

00:59:16.717 --> 00:59:19.846
Take the baby steps.

00:59:19.846 --> 00:59:22.560
And we also hear
often from students

00:59:22.560 --> 00:59:25.220
who its' really moving.

00:59:25.220 --> 00:59:29.350
They're floored that a
stranger would help them.

00:59:29.350 --> 00:59:31.472
And the way our
site works is they

00:59:31.472 --> 00:59:32.930
don't know how much
money you gave,

00:59:32.930 --> 00:59:35.150
whether it was $5,
or $50, or $500.

00:59:35.150 --> 00:59:36.275
But you do leave a message.

00:59:36.275 --> 00:59:37.524
You put your picture up there.

00:59:37.524 --> 00:59:38.680
And you leave a message.

00:59:38.680 --> 00:59:40.080
AUDIENCE: Lots of letters.

00:59:40.080 --> 00:59:42.274
OLIVER HURST-HILLER:
You get letters back.

00:59:42.274 --> 00:59:45.100
DIANE SOLINGER: That's
like Apple and his Dad.

00:59:45.100 --> 00:59:46.732
He wrote the letters back.

00:59:46.732 --> 00:59:47.940
So that personal connection--

00:59:47.940 --> 00:59:49.180
OLIVER HURST-HILLER: It's
ultimately about people.

00:59:49.180 --> 00:59:51.250
And that's, I think,
this very human thing

00:59:51.250 --> 00:59:53.770
that probably goes
back tens of hundreds--

00:59:53.770 --> 00:59:57.799
it's like in our DNA
to help each other.

00:59:57.799 --> 00:59:59.840
And when these students
are on the receiving end,

00:59:59.840 --> 01:00:02.540
they say, my gosh, these
strangers did this for me.

01:00:02.540 --> 01:00:03.799
It's quite powerful.

01:00:03.799 --> 01:00:05.590
TIM FERRISS: I had too
much caffeine today.

01:00:05.590 --> 01:00:07.310
But just one more thing.

01:00:07.310 --> 01:00:09.320
It's not just about
helping people.

01:00:09.320 --> 01:00:12.560
Because help, I think--
it's about enabling people.

01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:16.465
It's about trying to level
the playing field a bit

01:00:16.465 --> 01:00:18.540
by giving them the
tools that they

01:00:18.540 --> 01:00:22.540
need to be the highest
version of themselves.

01:00:22.540 --> 01:00:25.260
It's not a handout, specifically
with both these orgs.

01:00:25.260 --> 01:00:26.930
You're teaching
me with the code.

01:00:26.930 --> 01:00:29.770
You're helping people
to acquire a skill,

01:00:29.770 --> 01:00:33.150
whether that be something that
will return dividends forever

01:00:33.150 --> 01:00:35.237
in music, or STEM, or elsewhere.

01:00:35.237 --> 01:00:37.070
You're enabling them,
not just helping them.

01:00:37.070 --> 01:00:38.870
I think it's helpful to
think of it this way.

01:00:38.870 --> 01:00:40.970
OLIVER HURST-HILLER: That's
the power of education.

01:00:40.970 --> 01:00:41.870
DIANE SOLINGER:
Thanks everybody.

01:00:41.870 --> 01:00:43.495
And they'll be around
for a few minutes

01:00:43.495 --> 01:00:45.170
if you want to
ask the questions.

01:00:45.170 --> 01:00:45.770
[APPLAUSE]

01:00:48.470 --> 01:00:50.920
