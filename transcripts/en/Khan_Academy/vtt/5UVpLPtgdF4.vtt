00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.790
You've probably heard the term
Ponzi scheme before, let me

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:09.810
write it down, and what we're
going to do in this video is

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:11.360
explain what it really is.

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.050
You might have a sense it's some
type of scam, that you're

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:16.430
taking one person's money and
giving it to another, but

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:17.800
we're going to do a tangible
example of

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.290
how it actually works.

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:23.700
And right here, I have two
pictures of the probably the

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:27.530
two most famous perpetrators
of Ponzi schemes, this is

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:30.270
Charles Ponzi right here.

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:34.820
It was obviously named after him
and then, more recently,

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.660
this is Bernie Madoff, who
pulled off probably the

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.310
longest-lasting and largest
Ponzi scheme of all time.

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:46.380
Who knows, maybe there's a
longer-lasting and larger one

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.640
out there that we have still
haven't figured out yet, but

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.130
this is the largest
one to date.

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:54.450
And Ponzi wasn't the first
person to come up with the

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.350
Ponzi scheme, but they decided
to name it after him because

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.890
he was the first person to
really make it famous.

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.420
This mugshot was taken in the
early 1900s when he was

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.560
finally caught for perpetrating
his scheme.

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:07.910
So how does it work?

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:09.600
So let's start with some
investors here.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.040
We could get rid of pictures
of these two gentlemen.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.900
So let's say that I've got a
scheme, and what I'm going to

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.320
do is I'm going to set
up my investors, so

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:22.900
these are my investors.

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.960
And then, let's say, we have
several time periods.

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.930
So we can see why the investors
think, at least

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:31.970
initially, that my scheme
is legitimate.

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.290
So, let's say, that this is the
time period, so we have

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.930
period one, maybe this is years,
year one, year two,

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:44.570
year three, year four,
year five.

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.100
What I'm going to do is I'm
going to write each investor--

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.970
I'm going to write down how
much money they think they

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:55.860
have with me, the person
operating the Ponzi scheme and

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.210
then I'll show you exactly how
much money I have and how I

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.140
can even get away with having
the first investors think that

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:04.640
I'm legitimate.

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.410
So let's say I have
investor A.

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:11.810
So this is going to be their
investor's perceived-- let me

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.720
do this in a different color--
investor's perceived holdings

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.130
or perceived value.

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.560
And over here, I'm going to
write total actual value.

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.310
So you can imagine, this is the
actual amount of cash that

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.000
I have. So we have the investor
A in blue, and let's

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.250
say in year one, he
gives me $10,000.

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.730
And I say I I've got a surefire
way of doubling his

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:44.860
money in the second year.

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.090
So in the second year, I
actually do nothing with the

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.760
money and you know, I might
actually be spending it on my

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.940
own yachts and you know, fancy
suits and whatnot.

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.040
But let's just say I'm just
keeping it in a bank account

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.520
so you know, he gives it to me,
$10,000 and I do nothing

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:00.020
with that money.

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:01.060
I don't even get
interest on it.

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:02.383
It's not even in a
bank account, I

00:03:02.383 --> 00:03:03.490
stuff it into my mattress.

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:08.200
So the reality is, after a year,
it's still only $10,000,

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.360
but I promised him that I had
some type of a genius scheme

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.490
that could double his money
in a year, so I send him a

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:20.910
statement that says that his
$10,000 is now $20,000.

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.610
And I feel good about it because
I know that he's going

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:26.040
to be so excited that his money
doubled that he's going

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.300
to want to keep his money with
me, because he'll hope that it

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:29.400
can double again.

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.580
And not only is he going to do
that, but he's going to go to

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:34.310
the country club and show off
to all of his other friends

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.690
how he was able to do way better
than they did with

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:37.600
their investments.

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.290
So he's going to essentially
convince other

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:40.570
people to join in.

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:43.410
So let's say he convinces
investor B to join in.

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:46.830
Investor B looks at the
statement says, hey, this guy

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:48.542
running this-- well he doesn't
know it's a scheme, let's say

00:03:48.542 --> 00:03:51.140
he says , Sal seems to know what
he's doing, he doubled

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:53.620
investor A's money in a year.

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.510
I'm going to give him a bunch of
money, let's say I'm going

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:01.890
to give him $15,000
in year two.

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.860
So how much total actual value
do I have in year two now?

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:13.040
I have the $10,000 from investor
A plus this $15,000,

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.089
so I have a total of $25,000.

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:19.279
This is the actual amount that
I have in my bank account,

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:20.720
assuming that I'm not
spending it on my

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.330
yacht or my fancy suits.

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.240
But the total perceived value,
let me write that down another

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:34.940
line, if everyone actually
wanted the amount of money

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:36.800
that they thought they
had back, I would

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.540
have to pay out $35,000.

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:40.520
But we know that's not going
to happen, because people

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:42.560
think I'm such a good investor,
they want their

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.650
money to ride as long
as possible.

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:46.450
So you already see
this discrepancy.

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:49.830
There's only $25,000 in this
little pile of money that I'm

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:53.160
collecting, but people think
that there should be $35,000.

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.770
This is their perceived value,
because the this guy thought

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:59.050
his money doubled, although it
didn't, it just sat there.

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:01.270
Now, let's say that the next
year I sent them statements

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:03.710
that say, look, I made
super-awesome investments

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:06.250
again, the money
doubled again.

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:09.140
So this guy's money, his
perceived value, he gets a

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:13.170
statement that says you
now have $40,000.

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:16.690
This guy down here, investor B,
gets a statement that says

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:19.920
you now have $30,000.

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:22.990
And then they go back to the
country club, and they get

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:24.120
investor C onboard.

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.680
They're like, look, both of us
have tried out this guy, he's

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:29.630
doubled our money two years in
a row for both of us, you

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:31.190
probably want in on
this as well.

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:33.610
And investor C is like yeah,
well you know, my two buddies,

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:36.200
they look like legitimate
guys, let me

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:38.720
put my money there.

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:41.160
Let's say it gets bigger every
time because that's usually

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.030
how these things go, you know,
you normally don't don't have

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:45.330
just three investors, you'll
have hundreds of investors.

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:48.810
And the more fake positive
returns you get, the more

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:50.750
people that want to put
their money in.

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:52.870
So investor C, let's
say he comes in

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:57.320
and he puts in $20,000.

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:58.750
So what's the reality?

00:05:58.750 --> 00:05:59.470
Let's focus on it.

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:02.330
So there's a perception
on year 3, this guy

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:03.840
just put his $20,000.

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:07.840
A think he's got $40,000, B
thinks he has $30,000, so the

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:11.170
perceived value here's $40,000
plus $30,000, $70,000 plus

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:13.700
$20,000 is $90,000.

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:15.490
That's the perceived value.

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:18.200
But the actual value is just
going to be this $25,000 we

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:20.990
had in period two, assuming we
didn't spend the money or do

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:23.190
anything with it plus
the $20,000 that

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:24.310
this guy just deposited.

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:28.890
So the reality is $45,000.

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:33.700
Now let's say that as we go from
period three to period

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:35.900
four, or let's say right when
this guy gets his statement

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:40.790
for $40,000, and it's the exact
same time period that

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:43.200
this guy had put
in his $20,000.

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:46.520
Let's say person A, he says, you
know what, I felt like my

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:49.940
ride has gone long enough, I
don't want to test fate, let

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:54.960
me take my money out and you
might say, oh you the scheme

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:57.920
will be ruined, but it's going
to work because enough money

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:02.190
is coming in from new investors
to pay this guy off.

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:05.800
We now have $45,000 actual
value, even though the people

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:07.510
think there's $90,000.

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:10.710
So if this guy withdraws all
of his money, so if he

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:14.930
withdraws all of his money so
it goes to zero, I have the

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:15.680
cash to pay them.

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:19.000
I have $40,000 even though
people think there's $90,000.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.720
So I subtract out $40,000 right
here, and there's only

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:25.880
$5,000 dollars left in the bank
account and since this

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:31.000
guy withdrew his money, the
perceived value-- this $40,000

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.830
is no longer there, I gave the
guy the cash-- the perceived

00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:37.050
value now is $50,000.

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:40.740
So I essentially owe people
$50,000, investors B and C

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:44.220
think that they have $50,000
invested with me, but the

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:47.790
reality is that I only have
$5,000 in my bank account.

00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:50.090
And probably a more realistic
reality is I was probably

00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:54.730
spending a lot of this money on
my own little luxuries the

00:07:54.730 --> 00:07:55.500
whole time.

00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:58.880
But let's continue another way,
once again this guy, not

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:01.290
only did he double his money for
two years, they're all the

00:08:01.290 --> 00:08:03.610
same country club.

00:08:03.610 --> 00:08:05.820
This guy doubled his money
again, this guy just

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:06.670
invested his money.

00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:10.140
And now this guy says, look,
the scheme is legitimate.

00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:13.740
This legitimized the scheme
This is legit.

00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:16.570
Because, look, I doubled my
money for two years and I was

00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:18.410
able to withdraw the money.

00:08:24.450 --> 00:08:26.540
So he was able to withdraw his
money, so when he goes back to

00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:30.080
the country club, he gives this
guy and that guy more

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:32.320
conviction that this is
all on the up and up.

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:34.840
And then investor D will
probably jump in too and say,

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:37.640
wow, now that he's doubled money
two years in a row, I

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:38.549
see it's legitimate.

00:08:38.549 --> 00:08:41.539
Investor A was able to withdraw
his money, I'll give

00:08:41.539 --> 00:08:46.290
even more money, I'll
give $100,000.

00:08:46.290 --> 00:08:48.140
Maybe this is a ton of
people who are now

00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:49.740
going to put in a $100,000.

00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:52.400
And then the next year, I
double the money again.

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:54.290
And obviously, I won't make it
exactly double, I'll make it,

00:08:54.290 --> 00:08:56.790
you know 40% one year and 30%
percent the next year so

00:08:56.790 --> 00:08:58.460
doesn't look too suspicious.

00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:00.590
I want to make it look like real
returns, but for the sake

00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:03.190
of our math, let's say
I double it again.

00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:05.210
So now and we're in year four.

00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:07.840
And this guy withdrew all of his
money, but investor B now

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:12.800
thinks he has $60,000.

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:17.990
Investor C thinks
he has $40,000.

00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:23.890
And investor D thinks
he has $200,000.

00:09:23.890 --> 00:09:26.330
Oh, and I forgot to put investor
D's deposit here.

00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:30.230
So when he put a $100,000, I
only had $5,000 in my bank

00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:32.100
account, but then if I add
$100,000 I'll now have

00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:36.140
$105,000 in my bank account
after this guy comes in at,

00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:39.830
you know, at the end of period
three, we can imagine.

00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:45.130
And, with the perceived amount,
I owe is $150,000.

00:09:45.130 --> 00:09:48.480
So the green is what happens
after D comes in, so these are

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:50.350
no longer valid.

00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:53.220
But you can see that as more
money comes in, I have more

00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:54.810
and more money to pay
out, even though

00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:55.870
I'm not doing anything.

00:09:55.870 --> 00:09:57.980
Even though all of these
returns are fake.

00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:01.050
So now I actually have $105,000
even though people

00:10:01.050 --> 00:10:02.810
think, well that's at the end of
period three, at the end of

00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:05.470
period four, what
do people think?

00:10:05.470 --> 00:10:09.760
People think that I have
$300,000 of holdings.

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:11.010
Let me write that down.

00:10:15.850 --> 00:10:18.870
But the reality is I still only

00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:23.610
have $105,000 of holdings.

00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:25.610
This is the total
actual value.

00:10:25.610 --> 00:10:28.750
But notice, if this guy or this
guy, some of the early

00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:30.740
investors, wanted to pull out
some of their money, although

00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:32.910
they probably don't want to,
because where else can you

00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:36.310
double your money every year
and this guy already showed

00:10:36.310 --> 00:10:37.930
that I'm good for paying
back the money.

00:10:37.930 --> 00:10:40.070
But even if this guy or this guy
wanted to pull out their

00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:43.030
money, I would be able to give
it to them because I have at

00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:45.110
least enough for those
withdrawals.

00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:48.390
Now, everything would be
ruined if everyone gets

00:10:48.390 --> 00:10:52.720
freaked out or scared and if I
have mass withdrawals or if

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:56.170
more people withdraw money than
there is in the bank plus

00:10:56.170 --> 00:10:58.240
the amount of money
that comes in.

00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:01.500
So in order for a Ponzi scheme
to keep going, and Bernie

00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:05.060
Madoff was able to do this for
very long time, you have to

00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:08.250
have good, believable,
legitimate returns.

00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:09.710
Although they're not legitimate,
they just need to

00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:10.660
look legitimate.

00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:19.970
So that you have more money
coming in that out.

00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:22.480
And the whole point of the doing
this Ponzi scheme, if

00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:28.050
you're a stylish criminal, isn't
just to keep the cash

00:11:28.050 --> 00:11:30.780
there, you know, the $10,000
from one period to the next.

00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:32.600
The whole point of it is to
take a lot of that for

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:35.260
yourself, for you to live off
of and put into some Swiss

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:36.870
bank account to be able
to escape the

00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:38.580
country at some point.

00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:41.610
Anyway, hopefully you found
that enjoyable.
