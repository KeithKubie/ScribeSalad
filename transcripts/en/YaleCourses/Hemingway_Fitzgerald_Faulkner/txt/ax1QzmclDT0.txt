Speaker 1:          00:01          So I'm going to get started on, um, as I lay dying. And, uh, as with the sound of the fury, um, there's, uh, very, um, uh, kind of long genealogy, uh, behind the title of the novel. Once again, there's a very learned illusion, uh, behind the title, and it doesn't go back to the Beth. This time it goes back, actually goes back farther. It goes back to the Odyssey. Um, and you guys might remember said in book 11 of the Odyssey, um, bill ducs goes down to the underworld and he sees all the, he sees his mother, uh, but he also sees all the illustrators dead from the Trojan war and amount of debt that he talks to his Agamemnon. And, uh, we know that the mammo was killed when he got back from the Trojan war. Um, and so they see as ones to find out the circumstances of his death and Mammo and says, as I laid w obviously translation, um, as I lay dying the woman with the dogs, I would not close my eyes as I descended into hades.

Speaker 1:          01:22          Um, so it, um, there's no, um, that's, that's a very good, uh, record within the APIC. It is also picked up in various Greek tragedies because that's one of the central tragedies, um, in, in the classical world is, uh, the killing of Agamemnon, uh, bias, wife's lover. But there's a long story behind dad's, um, the reason that Chitin Nestra and I want you to remember that name because Kaiser Nestor will come up again, um, in light in August as a very, um, no, actually, sorry, she doesn't come up in later in August, she comes up in another novel. I'm in absolute Absalon, so it's a name that is very important to Faulkner, but, uh, within the confines of a, as I lay dying, uh, Clyde nest or Ashley didn't just want to kill her husband, you know, to have an affair with producers. She was actually a seeking revenge for the killing of her daughter.

Speaker 1:          02:23          Ivision I, uh, uh, when the, uh, the, the Greek ships were not able to sell because there was a dead calm. And so if should, I was sacrificed by Agamemnon in order to get them going. Um, and she knows that grievance for 10 years. Uh, and so when Agamemnon comes home, um, he was with his mistress, Cassandra from tri. Um, he was killed by adjusters with, uh, Chitum Nesta, egging him on. So this is the, in many ways, the sort of defining moment, the defining tragic moment in the classical world. Um, and then numerous representations of that, um, of adjusters killing Agamemnon with Patten, Lester looking on. Um, and this is a really handy, um, identifications, uh, illustration for us, all the names given to us. So a cleanliness, Nesta is there. It's just this is the one who actually does the killing at a [inaudible] electrode is his daughter and she will bring her brother back.

Speaker 1:          03:31          Wrist is to kill. It just is. So, it really is back and forth killing, um, across many generations. And Cassandra will in time. Well, we actually right there, uh, be killed by cattle Astra. So lots of violence, lots of hatred. And this is, um, the defining feature of the House of Atreus. So it's very important for Faulkner to be referring back to this ancient epic a moment. Um, because he's obviously talking about a family, uh, were fairly complicated emotional relationships, right? Is a family that is not entirely defined by love. Um, you know, we would like families to be defined by love, but usually most families are a little bit more complicated than this. Um, and in this case, the house of the abundance that the family, um, is infinitely more complicated than just being defined by love, even though it's on the other hand, the social spectrum.

Speaker 1:          04:34          So, um, let's keep that epic tradition in mind, but I also want to just to highlight, um, the immediate chronology for the writing of as I lay dying. Um, it's a very, very pat chronology, basically for six months, um, from the summer of 1929 to January, 1930, less than six months. Really. Um, a lot of things happen. So June 20th, a thought never married, has, um, childhood sweetheart. It's all of them. Um, and there was only two months after her divorce from her husband, Paul Franklin, um, ferry. You know, when something like that happens, you just wonder, you know, what the aftermath would be. Uh, what led up to it? Um, so anyway, two months after that is a very hasty marriage, uh, in many ways unseemly marriage. Um, and she brought to the marriage two children with Cornell, Franklin, Malcolm, and Victoria. Um, then October the seventh, 1929, the sound and the fury was published.

Speaker 1:          05:52          Uh, and the few weeks after that was to stock market crash. That in many ways was anticipated by the Jayson section in the sound, the theory, and the day after that, I mean, if that was still going on because the 24th was a Thursday, so Friday was actually the official day of the stock market crashed on that very day. Faulkner started writing as I lay dying. So we can think of a better, uh, novel occasion by the Great Depression, um, to have and have not as his title analysis. Um, it's very much a great depression novel, but as ELL as I lay dying is as well. So we have to keep that in mind. Um, and it was finished, uh, really fast, um, in just a few weeks. January 12, 1930, uh, as Ali, Diane was finished. And [inaudible] talks about it. He makes it very emphatic point about how fast it was done. Um, so in an interview with Marshall Sniff, um, 1931, he said, God, a job rolling coal in a power plan, found the sound of the dye them have very conducive to literature road.

Speaker 1:          07:06          As I lay dying in a coat bunker beside the diagonal between the working spouse on the night shift, finished it in six weeks. Never change the word. If I ever got rich, I'm going to buy a dynamo and put it in my house. I think that would make writing easier. So don't even shake is always, you know, you should never trust a word Faulkner says. Um, but I think that there's some things that, um, not to be disputed and not to be a fabricator. Um, and that was the fact that he was working, um, in a power plant, working night shifts. So this is very different from the Faulkner that we might've imagined just by looking at his house. Um, and I'm going to show you a picture of his house a little later, but, um, it, um, it looks like a very stately house, but actually when sophomore first bought the house, um, it was decrepit and was deemed unfit for human habitation.

Speaker 1:          08:12          Um, so he really was someone, a writer who was writing his great novels when he was working at a power plant, doing nice shoes. Um, and that is the world that he knew very well. So his circumstances were actually not that far and move from the circumstances of the London family poor ways, obviously. Um, so this is a picture of the House, um, 25 years after he brought it and we can see that it actually still looks a little too private. It's very, it's very stately shaped, uh, used to be afraid grant house. Um, but it's unpainted. And then Ashley, not afraid, you know, even 25 years he saw owning the house. It was nice. Still not repair. Um, so basically you spend the rest of his life trying to fix up that house. Well, we also see there is his wife Istyle. Um, and it turned out it was very good marriage and his bite of the haze, um, it lasts for the rest of his life.

Speaker 1:          09:14          Um, and here's the picture of the two of them side by side. Um, and so it's kind of a unexpected, the trajectory for that unseemly marriage, uh, back in 1929. Um, and so that's the family situation and is probably very complicated relation to his two stepchildren. Um, Polly do and what exactly what constitutes a family. Um, those questions would have been front and center for Faulkner. Um, in 1929 when he was writing this novel about families in general about generic poor white family, um, since the depression was right there in the middle of August, I thought that I'll show you a very iconic picture by Dorothea Lange. Uh, my mother, uh, 1936. This is an image this reproduced over and over again as the defining image of the Great Depression. Um, and it actually is quite different from the spirit in which as I lay dying, uh, was written. So, um, I think that this represents one way to think about the great depression, but actually the way that Faulkner things about the Great Depression, I argue is closer.

Speaker 1:          10:29          Um, to another class at work about, uh, the rural South James Agee and Walker Evans, uh, collaboration, um, is a text with lots of photographs. It's a collaboration between the two of them called let us now praise famous men. And I'll just show you a few pictures. A Walker, Evans, uh, pictures of, um, what it, how it feels to be a poor white, um, in also the same year as the Dorothea Lange picture. 1936. Um, so, you know, this is a little later after Wagner of Finnish has already finished as I lay dying, but this is what the house of a share cropper would have looked like. And I think, um, the common estimate was that 80%, maybe more than 80% of, of farm laborers in the south were sharecroppers. They didn't own the land. Um, so this is the interior of the house, uh, of the poor whites and other, and here in the bedroom.

Speaker 1:          11:32          Um, and I love this picture is Ellie Mae, um, beautiful phase, very proud and very sad and very resigned, but not giving up. And that's exactly my image of addy. Um, and as, um, poor white. So anyway, that is the background too as I lay dying. Um, and I think that we just need to, we you about two pages, two or three pages into the novel to see it. This is another highly experimental novel experimenting in Different Points of views. And this is really a dazzling array of narrators. Um, so in the first 18 chapters, these are the narrators, um, and nobody, nobody has to keep track of them. Um, just pick the ones that you can remember. Uh, but they also tend to have three distinctive voices. They actually are very easily recognizable, so don't worry, um, that in fact there's no danger that you get them mixed up.

Speaker 1:          12:36          Um, so in order to, um, talk about, um, this very rich, um, establish of, um, of, of points of views and styles of speaking and speaking voices. Um, I thought I'll introduce to other critics or theories about the novel Obama Narrative in general, actually not just about the novel because, um, narrative goes much further back than, um, than the novel. So the epic, the Odyssey would be one kind of ancient narrative. Um, although Bactine very celebrated Russian theories of the novel, um, doesn't like the epic are that much things. The novel is really the greatest thing replacing the APIC. Um, but in any case, that's what he says about the novel and what makes the novel so great is that even though there's this illusion when we just see words on the page and everything seems unified, that the novel is actually a highly diversified genre with loss of internal fractures.

Speaker 1:          13:41          And what generates those internal fractures, um, is that there are multiple languages in the novel, which is what he says [inaudible] is made up of social dialects. It kind of touristic group behavior, professional and Joggin's generic languages, languages or generations and age groups can then show to contentious languages, languages of the authorities or various circles and the passing fashions. So I think to express authority or intentions, but in a refracted way. Um, so we all know that that novels actually do register passing fashions very well. Right? So, um, uh, novel about a, the valley girl would have to work like, you know, the light would be repeated constantly. It wouldn't be realistic if it weren't. Um, so that's the, it's the nature of the novel. Um, two is to mimic her and speech. Um, and so [inaudible] is very, very, um, accurate in his description of the currency, uh, and the way that the novel is always up to date on the language that people, um, uh, using actual living people using.

Speaker 1:          15:00          Although novels can also choose to be historic novels, in which case they will be try to mimic the language or the 18th century of whatever as pension, you know, sometimes does. Um, and is a master at doing that. Um, so, um, so bacteria is great in terms of, um, talking about the social dimension of language and I don't think that you guys need to be reminded that this is directly related to our discussion of social types, right. And Hemingway and Fitzgerald. Um, so basically this is the social dialogues of various, um, label, label, label a social groups. Um, but I think that as we read, as I lay dying, we can also see that there's something else going on other than social dialects that back teens theory actually is inadequate to describing the spectrum of linguistic phenomena. And as I lay dying, so to supplement Bactine, I would like to introduce one other critic.

Speaker 1:          16:02          Distinguished British critic died in 2010 a commode. And this is actually a book that he wrote earlier, um, quite early in his career called the genesis of secret safe. The interpretation of narrative, um, and about teens theory. Um, is that, uh, that yes, we tend to interpret narratives when we given a narrative. Uh, most of us attended to interpret it in some fashion, but his argument is also that narrative's themselves our interpretations of reality. So, you know, the, when we actually try to interpret a narrative, we actually doing a kind of Mather interpretation in the sense that the narrative itself is an interpretation of, uh, of reality. And not only that, but that secrecy or sequence emerge in the course of that interpretation, which is a fascinating notion of how secrets are generated, not when we are trying to hide something from other people. But when we go about interpreting reality, that is when secrets become a reality, becomes a, when they become a recognizable a reality, maybe not legible, but, uh, they become registered as a dimension of reality.

Speaker 1:          17:25          So very, very interesting idea and move basically, um, is, is interested in the Bible that says is great reading of the gospel of mark, of Saint Mark. Um, and, but he's also interested in narrative in general. So let's, um, think about how his idea, uh, with, um, could be, um, incorporated or combined with back teens theory of social dialects, uh, to think about the basic linguistic paradigm. And as I lay dying, so while I like to suggest is that we can, uh, very schematically, uh, classify speech in as I lay dying under two headings. One is the social dialect and it has to do with functionally coders speech. Um, when you're within a particular group, a generic group, um, because there's so much commonality among that group, quite often you would just use, um, a shorthand. So, you know, for Liberals, Sarah Pailin would be one such shorthand, right?

Speaker 1:          18:29          You don't need to say any thing more of his roof reference therapy. And, and that's, that's enough. So that's one example of a currently functionally coders speech. Uh, it obviously is a dialect of the subgroup is not representative of the entire population. Um, and, uh, because it is so intimately formative of our subgroup, um, it, the, the very use of language can function as a socio economic and psychological portrait of that subset of the population. So this is very all witch, all those concepts are very important too about tea in that population is made up of various subsets and their lines of division among those subsets based on the linguist usage. So this is the social dimension and we'll think obviously about how poor whites would use the English language. Um, but um, almost move very beginning. And we also see that the English language is used in a different way and as I lay dying, so those are the worst with the secrets and it's very, very hard not to read as I lay dying without, I'm sensing that those was a pregnant with meaning, uh, quite often were denied access to those meetings.

Speaker 1:          19:45          Um, they sort of flaunt their toddlers with a meaning that is not available to us and that's part of the traction and power of those words. So I would like to think about those words with secrets. Um, along two lines. One is relatively short term and relatively transparent in the sense that we can get to them sooner or later and the other would be long running worse with cigarettes, um, that are very resistant to our investigation was to hold on to the secrets for a long time and maybe never giving up the secret, never yielding anything to the reader. Um, so let's start with the easier part of the spectrum, which is a very recognizable speech. Um, and I'm taking both those examples from Cora who is, um, I think it's fair to say is a fairly good example of a poor weight. Um, so I saved all the eggs and bade yesterday.

Speaker 1:          20:51          The cakes are turned out real well. We depend a lot on our chickens. They are good layers with few. We have left after the Parsons and such snakes too. In the summer I had to be more careful than ever because it was on my final say. So we talked on, we could have stopped cheaper chickens, but I gave my promise and as Miss Lowington said, when she advised me to get a good breed because Mr towel himself and miss the good breed of cows or hogs pays in the long run. So when we lost so many of them, we couldn't afford to use the eggs ourselves because I could not have had Mr Tao chides me when it was on my say. So we talked on so very proud woman. Um, but obviously under very difficult circumstances. These are the people who cannot afford to eat the eggs laid by their own chickens, um, and um, is because they lose so many chickens.

Speaker 1:          21:56          Um, and just from the possums and the snakes. And because those chickens are so expensive, um, they losing one means a lot to them. So all of that, which theme to be chorus responsibility. And I think that this is really, um, fatness, basic portrait of the poor. Wise. I'm very, very proud people in spite of the poverty. Um, we've lost some moral rectitude, um, in the sense that they're willing to take our responsibility upon themselves without recognizing that actually someone else should also be held responsible. The person who advises them to buy all these expensive chickens, which turns out to be very, very bad advice but not a word of complaint from Cora. So what we can say about this world is that this is a world and was moral responsibility is tightly and capsulated within the compass of the speaking voice. That there's the basic coincidence incidents between the boundaries of the self and the circumference of accountability so that you are completely responsible, accountable, answerable to anything that happens to you.

Speaker 1:          23:17          It is truly unfortunate that your chickens get taken by the possums in his neck, but it is your responsibility. Um, so Ms Lowington is reference is alluded to but no blame is attached to her. And I would say that this was really the defining future according to Faulkner, I'm of the mentality of the poor waste. And we can see one other instance of that. Um, so I bade carefully. Cora has been told by not intent again to do something. So I bade carefully more careful than ever. I bet in my life and the cakes turned out right. Well, but when we got to town this morning, Islams and told me the lady had changed her mind and was not going to have the party after all, she wanted to taken those cakes anyway. Case that well I say, I reckon she never had no use for them.

Speaker 1:          24:11          Now she ought to taken them. Kate says, but those rich town ladies can change the minds for folks. Can, Richard's is nothing in the face of the Lord for he can see into the heart. Maybe I can sell them at a basalt Saturday. I said they turn out real well. Um, once again, the same mentality that we s that we saw just in the earlier passage, uh, that full encapsulation of responsibility within incumbents have a single person, um, and that couple with a certain kind of, um, psychologically redeeming piety, uh, that even though something is be falling unfortunate is the following, the right now that God is the ultimate judge of everything. And once again, there's the deep reluctance to extend the blame to anyone else, either. Ms Lowington, other rich town lady who changes her mind about the cakes. Um, so, um, this is, uh, um, I would say a very sympathetic, um, although obviously critical, both sympathetic and critical portrait of the poor wife.

Speaker 1:          25:23          And, uh, it basically is the baseline is the baddest given a linguistic given psychological given the social given in the world of SLA dying. Um, and just about everything else that we see in the rest of the novel is a departure is a deviation from that given. So Cora is the styling point and everyone else, uh, moves away a bit from that starting point. And we can measure the degree of deviation or maybe a degree of dailene's, um, because as I lay dying, it's also about deviance and the consequences of deviance and to annul novel that we sleep. Um, but this is a very important starting point for Faulkner. So let's look at the various points of departure and most of departure from that linguistic baseline. And move on now to talk about the various kinds of worse with secrets. Um, one is very short term and I think that you guys know what I'm talking about doing del State Grid.

Speaker 1:          26:30          Um, and then the long running asleep grid in the bundling family coming into us from Dow judo. Naturally I've added one other vitamin. Um, so, um, let's look at the short cigarette Duda. Um, and she, she was picking cotton with leave, right? So, um, and she's decided in her own mind that if a bag is for, then she would do something. Um, so the decision is hinting strictly on whether or not the bag is for, and it turns out that Labor soon picking into her back. So it was four when we came to the end of the row and I could not help it. And so it was, I could not help it. It was then, and then I saw Dow and he knew, he said he knew without the words, like you told me that Maya is going to die without words. And I knew he knew because if he had sat in you with the words, I will not have believed that he has seen there, that he had been there and saw us police that he did know.

Speaker 1:          27:38          And I said, are you going to tell part? You're going to kill him without the words I said it. And he said, why? Without the words. And that's why I can talk to him with knowing, with hating because he knows who this is the first indication that the bundling family, my have something in common. The House of Atreus is the importance of the word heat in that family. Um, and it seems that hate hatred can come about because someone knows something about you and all of that. All of this ferry into hands exchange is conducted without words. So in many ways, this is, you know, fuck that obviously is not responding to about 10. He wouldn't have been thinking about [inaudible]. Um, but he's obviously thinking of a dimension of language that is not covered, that is not encompass by a social dialogue and in fact is not encompass by actual actually spoken worse other than other two towers that those emotions are going through.

Speaker 1:          28:47          Do a doubt. Faulkner has to use words to convey that, that, that, that, um, experience to us. Um, so Faulkner's using words but do though is not using words and dao is not using words either. And we know exactly what it is that the downloads, you know, that, that, um, that do that as in fact go into town, you know, because she is in such a condition, um, that she needs to do something about herself. Um, and it all comes from, uh, they've picking the cotton into her bag and what happens with a bag is for, um, so it really is a pretty transparent cigarettes. Um, and um, you know, I think the offers are in the know, uh, almost right there. They're not that many secrets that a young girl in her circumstances could have. So this is almost the only secret that she have and she does have it.

Speaker 1:          29:43          Um, so, um, that in itself was surprising. It's not surprising that she would get pregnant out of wedlock. There's not surprising. Um, it is surprising that she would hate dial so much because of that. So let's turn out to the more deep seated deep rooted, uh, kind of see with, um, that is not always disclosed to us. Um, as the words are spoken, uh, maybe not disclose to us as the narrative unfolds and maybe never disclosed to us ever. So, um, dow it turns out, um, as in fact, as soon as the novel opens, this is the opening paragraph of SLA dying right there in this very neutral looking, um, statement from Dow. This little secret, Joe and I come up from the field following the path in single file, although I am 15 feet ahead of him. Anyone watching us from the cotton house can see Jews frayed and broken straw had a full head about my own.

Speaker 1:          30:55          So it seems a kind of odd kind of emphasis on the spatial orientation of the bundle and how's the colony house and what anyone in the cotton house we'd be able to see. And the difference in height, the train Dow and Joel. Well difference in height, you know, is not public, not most difficult thing in the world for most people. Um, but within the family difference in height actually is kind of interesting in potentially significant. Um, so let's just keep that in mind that this, uh, what seems to be a kind of a telling difference in height between Dow and jewel and just leave that stick with bright there because Dow is not, maybe dad doesn't even know himself. Uh, but he's certainly the carrier of a secret that is revealed that is sort of given to us or slung at us, you know, that we just met to receive this thing that we don't fully understand at this moment.

Speaker 1:          32:02          Um, but this passage is, uh, in many ways deceptive in the sense that there's not any complicated language and there's nothing that we obviously don't understand, um, about the, about it. So I was still classified as being fairly close to the do Dell kind of cigarette is long running, relatively long running but it potentially could have the same kind of transparency there as do Dell cigarette. But let's look at um, something I was where the language itself, uh, becomes very different and this is coming from Joe himself and I really don't actually think I can read this very well so I would try it. But for them it's only, it's not making it easy for anyone who tries to read this. If it had just been me when cash fell off of that church and if it had just been me when pie late sake without low, the woods fell on him, it would not be happening with every bastion in the country coming into there as well because if there is a god, what the Hell is he?

Speaker 1:          33:04          Four it would just be me and her on a high hill and me rolling the rocks down the hill at the faces, picking them up and throwing them down the hill phases and teeth and all by God until she was quiet and not that got them as going one lake less, one lake less. And we could be quiet. Um, I truly don't know what to say about this passage. Other than that there's a lot of hatred in there, just like Dewey, those passage. Um, and it seems that for some reason hatred is the most powerful bond in this family. Um, and Jill seems these, you know, one conjecture that we could have about this passage is that he wants to throw stones down the hill as someone. Um, and it appears that he wants to throw stones at the rest of his family. Um, and we have no reason to understand.

Speaker 1:          34:07          It's not just that we are not good enough leaders that we don't understand. We actually have no reason to understand what's going on here. Um, because Faulkner does not want us to understand at this point. So all we know is that jewel is furious about something. He is furious that cash is making a coffin, um, for Addie for some reason. And he can stand that as going one lake less. That is the sound that he can stand, um, as well as the fact that Addie is on full display for the entire neighborhood to come and look at her, uh, when cash is trying to get that coffin. Radic. So these are the immediate circumstances that he really hates that she is, um, in disgrace because everyone, every bastard in the country, you can come in and look at her when she was waiting for her coffin and the calciums to be taking his time, making the coffin, but not maliciously, we would think.

Speaker 1:          35:07          Cause he's a very good carpenter and he wants to be a thorough in making a very good coffin. Um, but, um, but for some reason Jewel's hatred also extends to his father. And if it had been him when that low, the worth felt, um, uh, on him, that would have been good too. So it, it's just really, um, it's very peculiar. Uh, we don't know, uh, the long history, the long emotional history, um, behind all those people. They obviously are a very close knit family because there are so few people around that there's just not enough distance separating them. They're really basically all stuck in the same place. Um, and that creates, um, uh, kind of, uh, uh, the, the ideal condition to maximize any kind of hostility, uh, amount of family members. This seems to be one of the consequences of poor ways in a very small town with very few few neighbors.

Speaker 1:          36:14          Um, so, um, it seems at the very least that you as he imagines himself or is he experiences himself in relation to the rest of his family that he sees himself very much as an outsider. Okay. So Joe sees himself as an outsider that he would like to do something. He would like to throw stones at the rest of his family. Uh, and combined that with the fact that, um, Dow seems to be really, uh, fixated on that otherwise innocent fact that Joe is, um, whole head taller than he is. Um, the dose to the same link in some fashion. There's kind of a very, um, deep seeded in violent and always explosive kind of hatred coming from Geo and the neutral observation from Dow, the dose to the uh, uh, the pieces of some kind of jigsaw puzzle that we have to figure out, uh, in the course of SLA dying.

Speaker 1:          37:19          So let me just, um, give one more addition, uh, to that kind of configuration. Uh, based on what seems to be unmotivated or unaccounted for hatred, the hatred is undeniable, the violence is undeniable, um, is just that we're not able to read them very well. So Franklin low is actually right that this is a narrative that in the cause of making us compelling us to come up with interpretations is also generating secrets in that very act that the fact that we have to interpret the words that are given to us also generate secrets about the bundle and family. Well, he just do it all back again. Um, and we know that she's already, uh, been the carrier of one kind of secrets about herself. Um, that seems pretty transparent. Uh, but this is, seems to be secret of somewhat different order. And jewel don't care about anything.

Speaker 1:          38:30          He is not kin to us in caring, not care can and cash Lysol on the long hot yellow days up into plants, nailing them to something. And I did not think that thou would, that sits at the supper table with his eyes gone further than the food and the land full of the land. Degaulle is cow and the hose feel with distance beyond the land. Um, I think this is Ashley. Thoughtless belated attempt to write what he doesn't ride in the sound of fury, which is the portrait of three brothers toe from the standpoint of this sister. Um, do though is nothing like catty, but it's almost as a father is showing us that yes, he can certainly capture a young girl's point of view and maybe this is what comes out. So not exactly flattering or, uh, very, uh, uh, is, is a very intimate portrait of the three brothers.

Speaker 1:          39:34          Um, but it's not one that they would especially invited to see or hear about. Um, so something about jewel, um, seems to be emerging just in a course of what Dow is saying, what Joe himself was saying. And what do you do is saying that this is, it's a common pattern. Uh, the Jew is not kin to us. He's not care can he doesn't care for the rest of us. His interest seem to lie somewhere else. Um, so that, that, that fact is, is, um, you know, is, is fairly straight forward. Um, the little bit of observation about cash is interesting. Um, we know that cash is a good carpenter and Faulkner really want us to highlight that fact. The basically he's the one who brings in money to the family. Um, he's the one who's always hired by other people. It's the only one who is capable of bringing in real income into family.

Speaker 1:          40:27          Um, and he really wants to make a good coffin for addie. So, um, all that is not in dispute, but the way in which duly doubt looks a doubt that he's sewing up the long heart, said yellow days into plans suggest that maybe there's kinds of metaphoric and psychological dimension to concentrate as well. That even though he was a very skilled laborer, this also something very skilled workman. He's more than just labor is actually is an all listen, it's very skilled artisan. There is something about, uh, that act of frame methodically sawing the wood that says something about the mindset of cash. And so that is what do we doubt is noticing that as if, uh, even though no matter how good and all the sudden he is, uh, there's something maybe just a little disturbing or worrisome about the fact that he's so much into carpentry and then for portrait of doubt is, um, truly, um, I don't know what to make of that is very surprising coming from Dewey Dell, um, who so far has not been a very deep thinker or any, someone with very deep emotions actually.

Speaker 1:          41:45          Um, you know, she's worried about something very immediate and very simple really. Um, but this portrait of doubt that, um, that his eyes are gone food and this food and the land, he's not obviously not just registering the food and the landers is different degree of death between what his eyes register, um, and the quote service phenomenon of the third and the land. So there's a difference, um, in, in, in, in just the radius of, of uh, perception, uh, between what Dow is registering, um, and the most immediate physical world, food and land. Um, and I think that is because of that difference in the radius of perception, um, that the whole land seems to be embedded in his scout or dug out of the scout and then, um, their holes filled with distance. That in some sense the vastness, uh, both the vastness of the land, uh, they're enormous distance but also the holes, the gaps in that distance of those our path into Dallas skull.

Speaker 1:          42:52          Um, I mean I'm just paraphrasing the, they're not really elucidating that passage. Um, and I think that that's all we can do at this moment. That there's something special about Dao, uh, that he's not so easily describable in everyday language. So this is almost a direct reputation about teen. That social dialogue quite often cannot capture the psychological reality even of what appears to be the most important, you know, deprive a person, um, disadvantaged person. Um, so I want to um, give you one more example, uh, of, uh, of, of uh, a specimen linguistic specimen. Um, and the specimen that isn't the right word. Specimen would have been the right word for Hemingway would have been the right word for, um, for Fitzgerald in the short stories. But they're strictly ironic in the sense, but I use that word anyway. So this, this one instance of language that is also country completely incomprehensible to us.

Speaker 1:          43:56          Coming from a child from vitamin, it is dark, I can hear, would silence, I know them, but not living sounds now live in him. It is as though the dark. We're resolving him out of his integrity into an unrelated scattering of components. Snuffing was in stampings, smells of cooling flesh and ammonia at hair, and the illusion of a coordinated hole of splodge high and strong bones within which did hajj and secret and familiar and is different from my ears. I see him dissolve legs rolling. I a Gaudy splotching like co flames and flow, the bond, the dark and fading solution, all one yet neither or either yet. None. I can see hearing called [inaudible] caressing, shaping is hard shape, fetlock hip, shoulder and head smell and sound. I am not afraid. This comes right after two very dramatic moments. The chapter before development chapter is when we know that Allie is that the Eddie Bundra, there's like that is announce towards the very end of that chapter.

Speaker 1:          45:17          And then the chapter that is vitamins chapter right after that is when he actually goes into Peabody is bond the bond or the neighbor, um, and uses a stick to beat on the horses so that they all run away. And most of the, um, that chapter is devoted to bottom and, uh, beating on the horses and saying that they not even the day, but you killed my ma. Uh, so that in itself is kind of, you know, sort of understandable but strange in that he would pin, unlike Cora who would pin the responsibility on herself, vitamin pins, the responsibility for killing addie on it appears on Peabody. Um, and that's why he's beating on his horses. Uh, and, and in fact, uh, you know, just destroying the whole team. Uh, the, the horses run runaway. Um, and then after the peer buddies, horses, runaway vitamins, themes to be preoccupied with something else.

Speaker 1:          46:21          And this is a moment where [inaudible] really is having a great time. If his pronouns of, you know, who is this kid? Okay. I think they are at least two candidates. I think it possibly is, is Joe's horse, you know, this horse doesn't run away. And there's something about, there's nothings and stampings and a splodge hi, that suggest that it is to horse, um, that, that, that volume is talking about. This is the one thing that's remaining, um, this horse that doesn't run away, but there's also a possibility, um, that and is different from my is uh, just because of the syntactical construction or that sentence suggests that it probably, it might not be an animal, but the human being I'm a human being who is, is, is different from vitamins is in which case that human being could only be two. Right? So I think that this passage is meant to be deliberately misleading in the sense that we can tell exactly where Jude begins and where his horse with jewel end at way horse begins.

Speaker 1:          47:30          Um, the boundaries between the human being, um, and the horse, um, and also clear cut and in fact the identity. So the tube, uh, same to the interviews. Uh, and that is one of the great innovations in as I lay dying, um, those, uh, very ambiguous, uh, and, and southern boundaries between the human and the nonhuman. Uh, which actually is also one of the great defining attributes of the classical attic tradition. Um, so we'll come back to this and talk about the southern boundaries between human and nonhuman, both by going back to homer and Dante and so on, but talking about the implications in SLA dying.
