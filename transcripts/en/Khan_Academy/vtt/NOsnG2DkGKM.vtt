00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:04.990
Elizabeth starts out 5
miles away from school

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:08.880
and walks away from school
at 3 miles per hour.

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.330
So she's already 5 miles away.

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:12.000
And she's going to
walk even further

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.570
away at 3 miles per hour.

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:17.680
The table below shows how
far some other students

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.660
are from school
at various times.

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:25.270
Each person is moving at a
constant speed starting at time

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:27.780
is equal to 0.

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:31.020
Which students started
out farther from school

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:31.930
than Elizabeth?

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:33.939
Select all that apply.

00:00:33.939 --> 00:00:35.480
So essentially, we
need to figure out

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.060
where these students
were at time equals 0.

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.940
So we know where they
were at time 1, 2, and 3.

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.840
And so let's think
about their rate

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.660
towards or away from school.

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.590
And remember, this is
distance from school.

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:54.680
As we increase-- as we
go from hour 1 to hour 2,

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.420
Gordon gets 2 miles closer.

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.410
So his distance to
school is decreasing.

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.916
So where was he
at time equals 0?

00:01:03.916 --> 00:01:06.290
I'll put time equals 0 up here
because I don't have any--

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:07.270
actually, I'll
put it right here.

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:09.080
I'll try to squeeze
it into the chart.

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.990
So where was he
at time equals 0?

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.640
Well, he would have
been 2 miles further.

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.370
So he would have
been 6 miles away.

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:19.870
Notice that it's consistent.

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:22.270
In the first hour,
he would have gotten

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.145
2 miles closer to school.

00:01:24.145 --> 00:01:25.520
Then the next
hour, he would have

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.200
gotten 2 miles even closer.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.720
And then the third hour, he
actually gets 2 miles closer.

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.490
And he actually gets to school.

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.860
So Gordon started out 6
miles away at t equals 0.

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.970
So Gordon did start out farther
from school than Elizabeth.

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:41.620
So we can circle Gordon.

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:43.200
He meets the conditions.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.730
Now let's think about Giovanni.

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:49.840
So at time 1, he's 5
miles away from school.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.150
Then at 1 hour,
he's 5 miles away.

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:56.890
After 2 hours,
he's 6 miles away.

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.350
So he's getting
further from school.

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.410
So this is a plus 1.

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:04.130
And then after another
hour, he is 7 miles away.

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.790
So every hour that goes
by, he's a mile further.

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.110
He's going 1 mile an
hour away from school.

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.640
So where was he at time equal 0?

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.110
Well, he would have been
a mile closer to school

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:18.750
relative to time equal 1.

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.470
So he would have
been 4 miles away.

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.880
So he did not start out
farther than Elizabeth,

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.540
who started out 5 miles away.

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.350
Now let's look at Hannah.

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:32.880
Hannah, at every time, is
just exactly 5 miles away

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.070
from school.

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:35.840
So she's napping or something.

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.050
She is not actually moving.

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:43.570
She started out napping at
exactly the same distance

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:47.075
as Elizabeth, but she did not
start out farther from school

00:02:47.075 --> 00:02:47.700
than Elizabeth.

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.470
So Hannah does not
meet the criteria.

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.050
Now let's look at Alberto.

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:58.370
At time equals 1, he
is 9 miles from school.

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:04.580
And then after 1 hour, he
gets a mile and 1/2 further

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:05.870
from school.

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.540
After another hour, he gets
a mile and 1/2 even further.

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.796
So where was he
at time equals 0?

00:03:12.796 --> 00:03:15.170
Well, he would have been a
mile and 1/2 closer to school.

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:20.680
So 9 minus 1.5 is-- he would
have been 7 and 1/2 miles away.

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.200
So even though he is
going away from-- well,

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.810
he definitely started further
from school than Elizabeth.

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:30.540
Elizabeth started
out 5 miles away.

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.200
Alberto started off
7 and 1/2 miles away

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.820
and is going even further
and further and further.

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:38.070
So the two students that
start out farther from school

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:42.350
than Elizabeth are
Gordon and Alberto.
