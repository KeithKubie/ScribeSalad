00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.970
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.542 --> 00:00:06.500
SPEAKER 1: Please, let's
put our hands together

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:07.291
for William Winkel.

00:00:07.291 --> 00:00:08.126
Thank you.

00:00:08.126 --> 00:00:10.685
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:10.685 --> 00:00:12.810
WILLIAM WINKEL: Thank you
all for being here today.

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:15.510
My presentation is
called, "Myth of the Model

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:17.960
City, the Uprising of 1967."

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:24.480
I'm sure many of you have heard
about the anniversary of '67,

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.020
especially given
all the events that

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:29.010
are going on in the
city in the past year.

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.800
And the purpose of this talk is
to really flesh out and present

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.440
a nuanced view of
what took place

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.230
and why what took
place happened.

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.010
Given the amount if
time I have, we're

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.430
going to be starting in the
'60s, fresh off the bat.

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:53.750
Then we're going to backtrack
to see what led into '67.

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.820
Going into the
mid-1960s, Detroit

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.560
seemed happy, healthy,
and progressive.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.780
In 1964, the "Wall
Street Journal"

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.540
proclaimed Detroit to be a
model city on race relations.

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.530
They said, if you need to have a
high-functioning, diverse urban

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.190
area, look at Detroit.

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.720
They know what they're doing
and they're doing it right.

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.700
One of the reasons why
we got that moniker

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.040
was this march in
the background here.

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.900
In 1963, 125,000 Detroiters
marched on Woodward

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.960
behind Martin Luther King,
Jr., Rev. C.L. Franklin,

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.560
Walter Reuther, and
Mayor Jerome Cavanagh,

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.150
in what was the largest
civil rights demonstration

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:33.840
up until that time.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.050
The march was capped with
King's first iteration

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:40.950
of his "I Have a Dream" speech,
and it was a real feather

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.060
in the cap for the city.

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.960
The city was seemingly
progressive, powerful,

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.180
and moving forward
and acting as a leader

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.052
in terms of race relations.

00:01:49.052 --> 00:01:51.260
The city at the time was
still the fifth largest city

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:52.310
in the country.

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.290
We've got 1.67 million people.

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.050
We are still well-regarded
as the arsenal of democracy,

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:00.510
but the city was changing.

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:04.120
We were becoming the Motor City
that didn't make cars anymore.

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.790
One of the main changes
for us was our leadership.

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:09.460
Right around the
mid-1960s was when

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:12.350
we see the final
shifts between the two

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.900
major political parties.

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.080
The two parties spent the last
30 years changing platforms,

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.110
and this is when we
see the cementing

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.260
of Detroit's now-current
political structure.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:25.760
Mayor Jerome Cavanagh
was the first

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.010
in a long line of
Democratic leadership

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.380
that exists to today.

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.320
He was a break in
tradition in a lot of ways.

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.910
He was young, he was energetic,
and he was a Democrat.

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.160
Detroit had a long line
of Republican leadership

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.230
up until Cavanagh.

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.460
He's primarily known for
trying to do three things.

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:45.680
Bring in-- [INAUDIBLE]
money into the inner city,

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.340
clean up and integrate the
Detroit Police Department,

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.100
and clashing with Mexico City
to get the 1960 Olympics.

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.660
It can be argued he
failed at doing all three.

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.890
Detroit was on the up-and-up.

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:00.980
We weren't having
the same issues

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.570
that many other
cities were facing.

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:05.090
Rochester, Harlem,
and Philadelphia

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:06.440
were currently on fire.

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.510
Civic upheaval and
civic unrest seemed

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.600
to be a national
issue that Detroit

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.550
was sidestepping miraculously.

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:16.520
As a result, many people
started to look at us

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:20.795
and look at us closely, but
many, many things were missed.

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.130
What we're looking at right
here is a demographics map

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.240
of Detroit from 1960.

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:31.390
The dark colored-in areas
are where people of color

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:32.860
were allowed to live in Detroit.

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:34.597
The clear areas of
the map are where

00:03:34.597 --> 00:03:35.680
the white community lived.

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.780
A couple of you may
have noticed that I just

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.260
said where people of color were
allowed to live in the city.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.000
Detroit was an extremely
segregated city

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.750
with staunchly
defended neighborhoods

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.380
and the organization
to back that up.

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:52.220
Further complicating
the model city moniker

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:53.680
are these two maps right here.

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.850
The top one is employment
and the bottom one

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:00.290
is deteriorated or
dilapidated housing.

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.200
As you can see, these
two issues largely

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.700
correspond to where people of
color live, and only routinely

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.140
effect communities of color.

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:09.280
The white community
largely do not

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.490
have to deal with
these issues en masse.

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:15.100
Furthermore, despite the
fact that the Detroit Police

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:19.420
Department had 4,300 officers,
only 143 of those officers

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:20.690
were black.

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:24.260
95% of the police force was
white, and the majority of that

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.010
was Southern white.

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:30.620
Many recent arrivals from the
South in the last 30 years,

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:36.160
bringing with them Jim Crow
and other prejudices that

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:37.780
were a problem in the South.

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:41.515
Don't get me wrong, Detroit
had plenty of racists before,

00:04:41.515 --> 00:04:46.060
but bringing with
them a fresh energy.

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:50.230
Furthermore, with that
discrepancy in numbers,

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:52.980
the Detroit Police
Department engaged

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:56.050
in routinely aggressive
tactics towards the inner city

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:57.060
community.

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.890
The two primary
tactics the police used

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:02.650
were called the big four
and investigative arrests.

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:06.330
Many people point to and talk
about stress during this time.

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:08.960
The stress wouldn't come till
the late 1960s, early '70s.

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:14.050
The big four were
four officers--

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:18.900
one uniformed, three
plainclothes officers--

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.870
that would drive around in
a four-door unmarked sedan.

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:24.450
Their catchphrase was,
"Give me the corner."

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:26.810
That was their catchphrase
because, in these areas where

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:32.492
people of color lived, they
were densely, densely packed.

00:05:32.492 --> 00:05:34.450
Many of these areas,
while they did have homes,

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:36.110
the homes were
subdivided, meaning

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:38.440
that instead of a single
family living in a home,

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:41.020
there was either two or four
families living in that home,

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:42.750
and there were
apartment buildings.

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:44.694
Given the high
population density,

00:05:44.694 --> 00:05:47.110
there wasn't a lot of space
to hang out with your friends.

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:49.360
As a result, many people
hung out on the street.

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:50.818
They hung out on
the street corners

00:05:50.818 --> 00:05:51.970
relaxing and just chatting.

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:54.250
Many Motown singers actually
got their start singing

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:56.000
on street corners.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.200
So when the big
four pulled up, they

00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:59.650
said, "Give me the corner."

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:02.025
If you didn't, you were either
beaten, arrested, or both.

00:06:02.025 --> 00:06:03.816
Sometimes, they would
make a game out of it

00:06:03.816 --> 00:06:05.275
and they would say,
if you're still

00:06:05.275 --> 00:06:07.399
standing here by the time
I drive around the block,

00:06:07.399 --> 00:06:08.170
you're in trouble.

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:09.740
Stuff like that.

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:11.545
Additionally, the
Detroit Police Department

00:06:11.545 --> 00:06:13.900
would conduct
investigative arrests.

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:15.430
They would pick
people on suspicion

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:16.920
of having committed a crime.

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:19.680
The crime could be
as small as numbers

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:21.639
running or pickpocketing,
or as high as murder.

00:06:21.639 --> 00:06:23.555
What they would do is,
they would pick you up.

00:06:23.555 --> 00:06:25.622
They would put you in
jail for three days.

00:06:25.622 --> 00:06:27.830
And on the third day, they
would let you out and say,

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:30.070
you're lucky we didn't
find any info on you.

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:31.960
You get let out of
jail, sure, but you've

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:34.840
lost your job for not showing
up to work for three days.

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:38.110
Additionally, it was
harder to get a new job,

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:41.650
because when your new
prospective employer would

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:44.100
call the police department
and ask if you had a record,

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:45.850
they would show them
your permanent record

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:52.360
and it would say, he was picked
up on having committed a crime.

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:56.380
This practice largely
existed through the 1950s.

00:06:56.380 --> 00:07:00.280
Over 40,000 people were
picked up in 1957 alone.

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:05.800
While this tactic was phased
out in the late 1950s,

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:07.210
the marks on the
criminal records

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:09.751
remained until the mid-1960s
and it took an entirely separate

00:07:09.751 --> 00:07:13.140
effort to get those expunged.

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:16.980
Furthermore, in the mid-1960s,
Detroit's black community

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:19.400
was in a state of flux.

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:21.960
Given the urban
renewal that took place

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:26.070
in the 1950s and early
'60s, the black community

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:30.270
was suffering economically
and politically,

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:33.670
and despite comprising 30%
of the city's population,

00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:36.880
they wield very little
political power.

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:39.364
One of the major
victories politically

00:07:39.364 --> 00:07:40.780
for the black
community, actually,

00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:45.160
was getting Jerome
Cavanagh elected in 1962.

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:49.780
So as I've mentioned,
Detroit is highly segregated,

00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:52.850
staunchly defended, and this
didn't just happen overnight.

00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:55.270
This was well-planned,
well-executed,

00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:58.120
and decades in the making.

00:07:58.120 --> 00:07:59.350
And Detroit is not alone.

00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:01.870
Many other Northern cities
look exactly like this.

00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:03.580
When much of the civil
rights legislation

00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:07.330
was written in the 1960s, it
explicitly targeted the South

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:08.580
and ignored the North.

00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:16.387
This is a demographics
map of Detroit from 1940.

00:08:16.387 --> 00:08:17.970
Detroit, like the
rest of the country,

00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:21.700
went through the Great
Depression during the 1930s.

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:24.316
But because the rumors
were still strong

00:08:24.316 --> 00:08:25.690
that if you needed
a factory job,

00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:29.850
you could get one in Detroit,
many, many people kept coming.

00:08:29.850 --> 00:08:33.330
As a result, there was
a massive housing crisis

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:37.169
due to the lack of public
and private investment

00:08:37.169 --> 00:08:40.260
in housing, due
to the Depression.

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:43.510
When people began arriving
in the city in droves,

00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:45.150
they found farmland.

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:47.130
They found tents to sleep in.

00:08:47.130 --> 00:08:49.050
They found alleyways,
potholes, wherever

00:08:49.050 --> 00:08:52.470
they could lay their head.

00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:55.095
It was far easier for
the white community

00:08:55.095 --> 00:08:56.970
to find housing than
for the black community.

00:08:56.970 --> 00:08:58.850
When the black community
arrived in Detroit,

00:08:58.850 --> 00:09:02.730
the primary destination was
Black Bottom, Paradise Valley

00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:03.937
in the North End.

00:09:03.937 --> 00:09:06.260
There was another enclave
on the West Side, now called

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.090
the Old West Side.

00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:11.280
But as the black community
grew economically

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:16.520
and demographically, they
found other pockets to fill in.

00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:18.330
And each of these
other areas of the city

00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:20.160
demonstrates a different
tactic that was

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:23.220
used to deny black mobility.

00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:25.080
We had Conant Gardens
on the East Side

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:28.080
and Eight Mile Wyoming
on the West Side.

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:30.900
Two of the primary tactics
used to stop black mobility

00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:37.350
were called restrictive
covenants and redlining.

00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:39.420
Restrictive covenants
were legal maneuvers

00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:41.640
written into deeds
that simply said

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:43.470
what race could buy a home.

00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:45.870
The two primary targets
of restrictive covenants

00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:47.880
in Detroit were
the black community

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:50.250
and the Jewish community,
but the Latino community

00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:53.844
and the Asians community, they
were all targeted as well.

00:09:53.844 --> 00:09:56.730
Eight Mile Wyoming popped
up because a group of urban

00:09:56.730 --> 00:09:59.595
pioneers-- those were black
folks who want to live in white

00:09:59.595 --> 00:10:01.290
areas in nicer housing--

00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:05.580
found out that this
area was unrestricted.

00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:08.490
So a group of them got up
and bought a bunch of homes

00:10:08.490 --> 00:10:12.600
and settled the area,
founding a new neighborhood.

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:16.260
When World War II
began, and there was now

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:19.320
new funding and new
purpose for building homes,

00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:22.990
100,000 housing units were
built on the West Side alone.

00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:25.596
98,000 of those
were specifically

00:10:25.596 --> 00:10:27.220
earmarked for the
white community only.

00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:30.675
Only 2,000 of them were
open to people of color.

00:10:30.675 --> 00:10:32.800
Luckily, enough the Eight
Mile Wyoming neighborhood

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:34.920
was already established.

00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:38.740
When a real estate developer
showed up to the neighborhood

00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:41.970
and saw the empty land
next to them, and said,

00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:45.554
this would be a great place
to build a new subdivision.

00:10:45.554 --> 00:10:46.470
Make a bunch of money.

00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:49.330
It'd be a great day.

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:52.410
He goes to the Federal
Housing Authority.

00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:55.189
The Federal Housing Authority
was responsible for handing out

00:10:55.189 --> 00:10:55.980
mortgage insurance.

00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:57.940
If you wanted to buy a
house, you needed a mortgage.

00:10:57.940 --> 00:11:00.410
If you wanted a mortgage, you
needed mortgage insurance.

00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:02.370
And this is where
redlining comes into play.

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:05.280
The Federal Housing Authority
had a color-coded system

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:07.740
for providing
mortgage insurance.

00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:12.270
Green and blue were perfectly
fine, yellow was sketchy,

00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:14.330
and red was a big no.

00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:16.490
Red meant people of
color lived there.

00:11:16.490 --> 00:11:20.790
Yellow meant people of
color lived next to them.

00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:23.730
When he went to the
Federal Housing Authority,

00:11:23.730 --> 00:11:25.180
they said no.

00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:27.110
He said, why not?

00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:28.265
Black people live there.

00:11:28.265 --> 00:11:30.390
Don't worry, I'm not going
to sell to black people.

00:11:30.390 --> 00:11:32.310
I'm going to sell
to white people.

00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:34.060
Black people still live there.

00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:36.180
What can I do?

00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:38.790
I know, what if I built a wall?

00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:39.710
He built a wall.

00:11:39.710 --> 00:11:42.660
He built a half-mile long,
six-foot tall, one-foot thick

00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:44.910
concrete wall called
the Birwood Wall.

00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:46.740
That wall is still
standing today.

00:11:51.130 --> 00:11:55.540
When the majority of the black
community came to Detroit,

00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:57.740
they came to Hastings Street.

00:11:57.740 --> 00:12:00.180
Hastings Street was
the main thoroughfare

00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:02.800
of Black Bottom Paradise
Valley in the North End.

00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:07.150
It was cram-packed with
businesses, dentists, doctors,

00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:10.735
insurance companies, lawyers,
markets, haberdashers,

00:12:10.735 --> 00:12:11.830
the whole nine yards.

00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:13.496
If you needed something
you could get it

00:12:13.496 --> 00:12:14.440
on Hastings Street.

00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:16.690
The problem with
Hastings Street,

00:12:16.690 --> 00:12:18.130
and what would be
a major problem

00:12:18.130 --> 00:12:20.470
for the black
community, was just

00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:23.260
because the black community
lived there, does not mean

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:25.150
the black community owned it.

00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:29.680
Additionally,
Hastings Street was

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:33.020
one of the, if not
the most, [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:35.170
school neighborhood in the city.

00:12:35.170 --> 00:12:36.490
It was one of the oldest.

00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:39.220
it was full of
turn-of-the-century century

00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:40.190
buildings.

00:12:40.190 --> 00:12:42.190
If these buildings had
plumbing and electricity,

00:12:42.190 --> 00:12:44.320
they were most
likely retrofitted.

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:46.280
We have oral histories
from Black Bottom which

00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:48.790
said there were still outhouses
in the neighborhood going

00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:51.610
into the 1940s.

00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:54.490
That would become a major issue
for the black community going

00:12:54.490 --> 00:13:00.650
into the 1940s and
into the 1950s.

00:13:00.650 --> 00:13:03.610
To ease this housing crunch,
the federal government

00:13:03.610 --> 00:13:06.910
stepped in and said, we need
a place for black war workers

00:13:06.910 --> 00:13:08.780
to live, and public
housing is going

00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:10.510
to be the way we're
going to do it.

00:13:10.510 --> 00:13:13.490
Eleanor Roosevelt opened the
Brewster-Douglass project

00:13:13.490 --> 00:13:14.250
herself.

00:13:14.250 --> 00:13:15.850
And the third
project on the list

00:13:15.850 --> 00:13:18.424
was the Sojourner
Truth housing project.

00:13:18.424 --> 00:13:19.840
The federal
government believed it

00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:22.900
was close enough to Conant
Gardens on the East Side not

00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:24.700
to cause a stir.

00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:26.740
They were mistaken.

00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:29.200
It was seven blocks within a
white neighborhood at Seven

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:34.290
Mile and Fenelon, and the
residents, it's safe to say,

00:13:34.290 --> 00:13:36.760
were super pissed.

00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:38.734
They took this issue
to their congressman,

00:13:38.734 --> 00:13:40.150
who went to the
floor of the House

00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:42.024
to denounce the federal
government for moving

00:13:42.024 --> 00:13:44.410
black people into
his neighborhood.

00:13:44.410 --> 00:13:46.660
It became a massive tug-of-war
between the residents,

00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:48.160
the city, and the
federal government

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:50.640
about what type of
project this would be,

00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:53.440
whether it would be
black, white, or mixed.

00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:56.630
During construction, it was
just a massive tug of war.

00:13:56.630 --> 00:13:59.570
Finally, the federal government
put its foot down and said,

00:13:59.570 --> 00:14:01.800
we need places for black
war workers to live

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:03.910
and that's the end of it.

00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:07.500
As tenants were beginning to
move in to Sojourner Truth,

00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:09.550
they were greeted by this sign.

00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:11.370
Not only were they
greeted by this sign,

00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:14.960
they were greeted by 1,200
very angry protesters.

00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:17.460
A scuffle ensued, and the
Detroit Police Department

00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:19.210
ordered all the
tenants to leave,

00:14:19.210 --> 00:14:21.371
saying they couldn't
guarantee their protection.

00:14:21.371 --> 00:14:23.745
The tenants would later be
moved in under the armed guard

00:14:23.745 --> 00:14:26.860
of the Michigan National Guard.

00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:31.852
Fully armed, machine guns,
the whole nine yards.

00:14:31.852 --> 00:14:33.310
The Sojourner Truth
housing project

00:14:33.310 --> 00:14:38.440
would be the site of drive-bys,
people driving by and shooting

00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:41.500
into it, bricks through windows,
and the occasional burning

00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:45.220
cross for the next few years.

00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:48.990
We don't just leave our violence
behind at Sojourner Truth.

00:14:48.990 --> 00:14:53.580
The city boiled over in
1943, in the 1943 race riots.

00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:58.680
Preceding the 1943 race riot,
though, was the Packard strike.

00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:01.220
The city is in the
midst of World War II.

00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:04.590
We're pumping as much munitions
into the war effort as we can.

00:15:04.590 --> 00:15:08.850
And one of those vital
factories is the Packard plant.

00:15:08.850 --> 00:15:10.920
This is the Packard
Motor Car company.

00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:13.480
What they're doing is,
they're making engines.

00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:18.370
Given the fact that everyone
is needed for the war effort,

00:15:18.370 --> 00:15:21.570
there is a massive
labor shortage still.

00:15:21.570 --> 00:15:24.870
Packard's solution
was, hire black people

00:15:24.870 --> 00:15:26.880
to do the same work.

00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:30.660
Three black men were promoted
to the line at Packard,

00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:34.410
and the next day 25,000
whites walked off the job.

00:15:34.410 --> 00:15:36.000
Their placards
read, I'd rather see

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.196
Hitler or Hirohito win than
to work next to a black man.

00:15:39.196 --> 00:15:43.330
And they weren't that
kind in their language.

00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:47.130
The city boiled over into the
1943 race riot a short time

00:15:47.130 --> 00:15:48.160
later.

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:53.250
There were over 100,000 people
on Belle Isle that Sunday,

00:15:53.250 --> 00:15:55.530
and there were minor racial
skirmishes here and there,

00:15:55.530 --> 00:15:59.430
but everyone went
home that night.

00:15:59.430 --> 00:16:03.210
The best story we have
is, one of the young men

00:16:03.210 --> 00:16:05.250
who was involved in
the skirmishes that day

00:16:05.250 --> 00:16:08.130
went to the Forest
Club in Paradise Valley

00:16:08.130 --> 00:16:10.830
and was chatting with
an acquaintance of his.

00:16:10.830 --> 00:16:12.820
He was talking about
the goings-on of the day

00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:14.760
and what had
happened on the Isle.

00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:18.034
And then all of a sudden,
the gentleman stood up,

00:16:18.034 --> 00:16:19.950
announced to the bar
that a group of white men

00:16:19.950 --> 00:16:23.980
threw a black woman and her
baby off the Belle Isle Bridge.

00:16:23.980 --> 00:16:27.000
The bar patrons didn't take
too kindly to hearing that,

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.580
so a group of them went over
to the Belle Isle Bridge,

00:16:29.580 --> 00:16:33.090
where a fight ensued with a
group of military recruits.

00:16:33.090 --> 00:16:35.480
While that's going
on, another rumor

00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:37.160
is spreading around
the white community

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:39.570
that a group of black men
assaulted a white woman

00:16:39.570 --> 00:16:40.665
downtown.

00:16:40.665 --> 00:16:43.250
The two rumors and
the scuffles meet,

00:16:43.250 --> 00:16:45.870
and it is brawling
in the streets.

00:16:45.870 --> 00:16:51.900
It is two days of violence
and hand-to-hand combat.

00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:53.380
The violence tended
to break down

00:16:53.380 --> 00:16:56.440
with the black community
targeting property, either

00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:58.980
through fire, just
damage, or looting,

00:16:58.980 --> 00:17:00.450
while the white
community targeted

00:17:00.450 --> 00:17:02.340
the black community itself.

00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:04.490
And that is reflected
in the death toll,

00:17:04.490 --> 00:17:08.160
through cold-blooded
murder, beatings, maulings,

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:10.890
the whole nine yards.

00:17:10.890 --> 00:17:16.079
It took 6,000 federal troops
to come in and put it down.

00:17:16.079 --> 00:17:18.240
Eleanor Roosevelt urged
her husband, the president,

00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:20.220
to do a Fireside Chat
on race relations

00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:21.420
to move the issue forward.

00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:23.250
Let's get over this.

00:17:23.250 --> 00:17:25.470
President Roosevelt
declined in favor

00:17:25.470 --> 00:17:27.450
of getting war
production back on track,

00:17:27.450 --> 00:17:31.300
because war production fell 6%.

00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:36.930
We have a few stories from '43
that aren't totally terrible.

00:17:36.930 --> 00:17:38.460
First one is this
photo right here.

00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:41.670
We have a Detroit police officer
protecting a young black man

00:17:41.670 --> 00:17:44.307
from an angry mob.

00:17:44.307 --> 00:17:46.890
I would love to say that this
is standard operating procedure,

00:17:46.890 --> 00:17:48.210
but unfortunately, it wasn't.

00:17:48.210 --> 00:17:50.970
The Detroit Police
Department was actually

00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:53.669
dressed down pretty aggressively
by the federal troops who

00:17:53.669 --> 00:17:55.960
came into town and saw how
they were acting, especially

00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:58.844
towards the black community.

00:17:58.844 --> 00:18:00.260
I had the pleasure
of interviewing

00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:02.980
a woman who was there that day.

00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:06.082
And for work, what
she would do is,

00:18:06.082 --> 00:18:08.290
she would pick up all the
bills along Hastings Street

00:18:08.290 --> 00:18:11.050
from the businesses, and
take them down to City Hall

00:18:11.050 --> 00:18:13.200
to pay them all.

00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:14.910
So she collected the bills.

00:18:14.910 --> 00:18:16.290
Someone said, what
are you doing?

00:18:16.290 --> 00:18:17.790
She said, I'm going
to go pay these.

00:18:17.790 --> 00:18:19.634
They were like, that's
a terrible idea.

00:18:19.634 --> 00:18:21.050
She's like, you
know I'll be fine.

00:18:21.050 --> 00:18:22.810
So she hops on the
Woodward streetcar

00:18:22.810 --> 00:18:24.350
and starts heading downtown.

00:18:24.350 --> 00:18:26.670
The only other person
on the streetcar

00:18:26.670 --> 00:18:29.774
is an elderly white woman.

00:18:29.774 --> 00:18:30.440
They look ahead.

00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:32.106
They're seeing something
but can't quite

00:18:32.106 --> 00:18:33.030
make out what it is.

00:18:33.030 --> 00:18:34.619
It is a massive white mob.

00:18:34.619 --> 00:18:36.660
What white mobs have been
doing during this time,

00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:39.150
have been going up
and down Woodward,

00:18:39.150 --> 00:18:42.370
pulling black people out of
bars, cars, streetcars, buses,

00:18:42.370 --> 00:18:44.767
and beating them.

00:18:44.767 --> 00:18:46.350
The white woman looks
at her and says,

00:18:46.350 --> 00:18:47.950
I think you should
get under my chair.

00:18:47.950 --> 00:18:49.840
I don't know what
they're going to do.

00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:54.140
So she crawls under a chair,
they cover her up with bags.

00:18:54.140 --> 00:18:55.250
Mob storms the street car.

00:18:55.250 --> 00:18:56.090
They look around.

00:18:56.090 --> 00:18:57.630
Are you the only one here?

00:18:57.630 --> 00:18:59.210
Yup.

00:18:59.210 --> 00:18:59.845
Fine.

00:18:59.845 --> 00:19:04.920
And they exit the streetcar
and the woman's protected.

00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:08.100
We leave a lot of the
violence behind in the 1940s,

00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:11.310
but we have a brand
new plethora of issues.

00:19:11.310 --> 00:19:13.975
We see the making of modern
Detroit in the 1950s,

00:19:13.975 --> 00:19:15.350
through mass
deindustrialization,

00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:20.310
through white flight
and blockbusting,

00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:23.240
and furthering all
of this is City Hall.

00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:26.700
City Hall at the time is run
by Mayor Albert Cobo, who

00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:29.970
ran an explicit
campaign of stopping

00:19:29.970 --> 00:19:33.450
the black invasion of
Detroit, and his policies

00:19:33.450 --> 00:19:39.784
do not do anything to either
mend or improve the situation.

00:19:39.784 --> 00:19:43.970
Restrictive covenants are
ruled unconstitutional in 1948,

00:19:43.970 --> 00:19:46.560
and as a result, we see the
explosion of homeowners'

00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:48.530
associations across Detroit.

00:19:48.530 --> 00:19:51.375
A homeowners' association
called the Seven Mile Fenelon

00:19:51.375 --> 00:19:54.240
Homeowners' Association was
responsible for putting up

00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:57.270
the sign I showed you earlier,
and their presence in the city

00:19:57.270 --> 00:19:59.642
only grew from there.

00:19:59.642 --> 00:20:01.100
Homeowners'
associations would have

00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:05.070
said that they're only there
to protect home equity,

00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:06.584
to protect your investment.

00:20:06.584 --> 00:20:08.250
If you asked them how
they are doing it,

00:20:08.250 --> 00:20:10.974
they were keeping black people
out of the neighborhood.

00:20:10.974 --> 00:20:12.390
In the South, I'm
sure many of you

00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:14.340
have heard of White
Citizens' Councils.

00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:16.978
They were our White
Citizens' Councils.

00:20:16.978 --> 00:20:21.280
Throughout the 1950s, we see
the prevalence of the big four.

00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:23.370
Investigative arrests explode.

00:20:23.370 --> 00:20:26.310
And then we see
neighborhood destruction

00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:27.900
and the cementing
of modern Detroit

00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:31.960
for freeway construction.

00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:35.090
Many people won't really
associate this quote with 1961,

00:20:35.090 --> 00:20:38.770
but Detroit's decline has been
going on for a long while.

00:20:38.770 --> 00:20:42.430
"Time" magazine said it,
and with good reason.

00:20:42.430 --> 00:20:46.270
Between 1952 and
1960, Detroit lost

00:20:46.270 --> 00:20:51.490
23.4% of the white community
to the suburbs and elsewhere,

00:20:51.490 --> 00:20:54.010
the majority to the suburbs.

00:20:54.010 --> 00:20:56.560
That number is baffling
to some, but is actually

00:20:56.560 --> 00:20:59.860
really easy to explain.

00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:02.240
A number of things are happening
in Detroit all at once.

00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:04.660
Detroit was facing mass
deindustrialization,

00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:06.830
like it had never
experienced before.

00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:13.540
After World War II, the Big
Three built 19 new plants,

00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:15.500
and those were not in
the city of Detroit.

00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:18.850
They were in the suburbs and
other satellite communities.

00:21:18.850 --> 00:21:22.210
They did that for a number of
really good economic reasons.

00:21:22.210 --> 00:21:24.220
You didn't need to tear
down your old factory

00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:26.920
to build a new one.

00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:30.040
You could get away
with lesser taxes,

00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:33.700
because the suburbs were not
nearly as strong as the city.

00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:36.040
They were changing the way
factories were being built.

00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:38.230
They were no longer
tall, multi-story plants.

00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:41.160
They were large,
single-story facilities,

00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:43.030
which meant you
didn't need to buy out

00:21:43.030 --> 00:21:44.920
homeowners that were
living across the street

00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:46.464
from your factory.

00:21:46.464 --> 00:21:48.130
And additionally, the
federal government

00:21:48.130 --> 00:21:50.590
wanted have the majority of
the plants out of Detroit

00:21:50.590 --> 00:21:52.184
immediately.

00:21:52.184 --> 00:21:53.790
The federal
government didn't want

00:21:53.790 --> 00:21:58.240
one nuclear bomb taking out 10%
of the nation's manufacturing

00:21:58.240 --> 00:21:58.930
base.

00:21:58.930 --> 00:22:03.300
As a result, spreading it out
was much safer for the nation,

00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:06.180
but not for Detroit.

00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:09.040
As these plants are
moving out of the city,

00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:10.830
the white community
is following,

00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:12.246
because a lot of
people don't want

00:22:12.246 --> 00:22:14.770
to drive 40 minutes to work.

00:22:14.770 --> 00:22:18.580
As a result, the
white community begins

00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:20.620
diminishing very quickly.

00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:24.310
But as you can see, the black
community continues to grow.

00:22:24.310 --> 00:22:25.780
That is because
the black community

00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:28.970
didn't have the same avenues
of getting to the suburbs

00:22:28.970 --> 00:22:30.640
that the white community did.

00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:33.160
In order to move to the
suburbs, you needed a house.

00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:35.540
In order to get a house,
you had to have a mortgage.

00:22:35.540 --> 00:22:39.135
You had to get a mortgage
to buy one or to build one,

00:22:39.135 --> 00:22:41.559
and to do that, you
needed mortgage insurance,

00:22:41.559 --> 00:22:43.600
and the black community
still did not have access

00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:45.550
to mortgage insurance en masse.

00:22:45.550 --> 00:22:48.980
Even going into 1970, the
suburban population of color

00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:50.080
stood at only 3.6%.

00:22:53.710 --> 00:22:59.720
While the factories are moving
out, other factories are dying.

00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:04.070
Packard and Hudson Motor Car
Companies go out of business.

00:23:04.070 --> 00:23:07.510
They go bankrupt due to the
rolling recessions in the '50s,

00:23:07.510 --> 00:23:13.530
and 90,000 jobs were lost on the
East Side in two years alone.

00:23:13.530 --> 00:23:17.050
Between 1947 and
1967, Detroit loses

00:23:17.050 --> 00:23:19.200
47% of its manufacturing base.

00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:28.470
What you see here is a flyer
from the West Side Home

00:23:28.470 --> 00:23:31.080
and Property Owners'
Protective Association,

00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:36.750
arguing that if the freeways
are built as they're proposed,

00:23:36.750 --> 00:23:40.080
your property values are
going to be destroyed

00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:42.780
and drastic change
will come to the city.

00:23:42.780 --> 00:23:44.430
And they are arguing
that because they

00:23:44.430 --> 00:23:46.150
are partially right.

00:23:46.150 --> 00:23:47.820
Not on the property
values thing,

00:23:47.820 --> 00:23:49.416
but drastic change was coming.

00:23:49.416 --> 00:23:51.540
Unlike other major cities,
where they used freeways

00:23:51.540 --> 00:23:54.240
to divide races,
Detroit initially

00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:57.677
seemingly tried to
use them to integrate.

00:23:57.677 --> 00:23:59.760
Instead of putting them
between two neighborhoods,

00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:02.640
Detroit put its freeway
right up the middle

00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:04.236
of the black community.

00:24:04.236 --> 00:24:05.610
That picture I
showed you earlier

00:24:05.610 --> 00:24:08.190
of Hastings Street, most
of you have probably

00:24:08.190 --> 00:24:09.780
driven on Hastings Street.

00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:13.530
It's the I-75 freeway.

00:24:13.530 --> 00:24:16.170
Hastings Street is gone,
wiped away, along with all

00:24:16.170 --> 00:24:18.672
of its businesses and much
of the black community's

00:24:18.672 --> 00:24:20.180
economic might.

00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:23.224
Black Bottom is
demolished to make room

00:24:23.224 --> 00:24:25.140
for Lafayette Park, which
I'm sure many of you

00:24:25.140 --> 00:24:27.000
have also seen.

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:31.416
The city and national officials
touted it as urban renewal.

00:24:31.416 --> 00:24:32.790
We're cleaning up
the inner city.

00:24:32.790 --> 00:24:35.040
We're going to make it great
for everyone living here.

00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:36.690
It's gong to be
a grand old time.

00:24:36.690 --> 00:24:38.580
People being evicted
simply referred to it

00:24:38.580 --> 00:24:41.410
as negro removal.

00:24:41.410 --> 00:24:45.450
Additionally, this outpouring,
this seeming mass migration

00:24:45.450 --> 00:24:49.440
of refugees from the
three neighborhoods

00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:52.470
sparked a great deal
of fear and uncertainty

00:24:52.470 --> 00:24:54.180
in the rest of the city.

00:24:54.180 --> 00:24:55.681
Primarily just the
rest of the city,

00:24:55.681 --> 00:24:58.138
because the black community
didn't have the means of moving

00:24:58.138 --> 00:24:58.900
to the suburbs.

00:24:58.900 --> 00:25:02.450
So as the black community
began spreading across Detroit,

00:25:02.450 --> 00:25:06.450
many segregationist whites
and many uncertain whites

00:25:06.450 --> 00:25:10.050
simply begin moving either to
the farther edges of the city

00:25:10.050 --> 00:25:13.200
or moving out altogether.

00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:15.750
One tactic that was
used during this,

00:25:15.750 --> 00:25:18.580
much to the detriment of the
city, was called blockbusting.

00:25:18.580 --> 00:25:22.800
What blockbusting was,
was a real estate agent

00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:25.650
would either hire a
young black mother

00:25:25.650 --> 00:25:31.470
with a toddler in a stroller,
burly black men in larger cars,

00:25:31.470 --> 00:25:36.512
or groups of black teens
and young kids with bikes.

00:25:36.512 --> 00:25:38.970
What they would do is, they
would have the mother walk down

00:25:38.970 --> 00:25:39.810
the street.

00:25:39.810 --> 00:25:42.240
They'd have the men drive
down the street slowly,

00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:43.884
with their stereos cranked up.

00:25:43.884 --> 00:25:46.050
Or they'd have the kids
ride around the neighborhood

00:25:46.050 --> 00:25:47.050
on their bikes.

00:25:47.050 --> 00:25:48.750
They'd wait a day or
two, and then they

00:25:48.750 --> 00:25:50.920
would call every
house on the block.

00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:54.090
They're like, hey, we've got
this great new development

00:25:54.090 --> 00:25:57.450
in Royal Oak that you
should totally check out.

00:25:57.450 --> 00:26:02.520
And because it was a
common belief at the time

00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:04.710
that if a black person
moved into your neighborhood

00:26:04.710 --> 00:26:07.470
you just lost $15,000
on your house,

00:26:07.470 --> 00:26:11.370
so many people would sell
low and get out before they

00:26:11.370 --> 00:26:12.770
lost any more money.

00:26:12.770 --> 00:26:16.270
And then the real estate agent
would simply flip the house,

00:26:16.270 --> 00:26:18.780
often to a
unsuspecting person who

00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:21.030
couldn't make the payments
in the first place,

00:26:21.030 --> 00:26:22.830
and the cycle would
repeat itself,

00:26:22.830 --> 00:26:25.911
destroying Detroit's property
values all across the city.

00:26:29.070 --> 00:26:32.310
And for many people, this
was an easy decision to make,

00:26:32.310 --> 00:26:34.290
because the freeways
that are now

00:26:34.290 --> 00:26:37.445
brand-new allow easy access
to and from the suburbs.

00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:43.410
This is the area that
was torn down to make way

00:26:43.410 --> 00:26:45.090
for the I-75 freeway.

00:26:45.090 --> 00:26:48.170
As you can see, the
freeway makes up

00:26:48.170 --> 00:26:50.512
a very tiny portion of it.

00:26:50.512 --> 00:26:52.470
The periphery of the
freeway was also torn down

00:26:52.470 --> 00:26:53.922
to make room for development.

00:26:53.922 --> 00:26:55.380
The problem was,
in the early '60s,

00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:56.980
there was no money
for development,

00:26:56.980 --> 00:27:01.200
so the land sat empty for years.

00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:05.120
One of the places that
the black community went,

00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:08.040
after Black Bottom
and Paradise Valley,

00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:11.310
was the Virginia Park
neighborhood on the West Side.

00:27:11.310 --> 00:27:15.390
The Virginia Park neighborhood
was a Jewish neighborhood.

00:27:15.390 --> 00:27:17.105
It was far easier
for black folks

00:27:17.105 --> 00:27:18.480
to move into Jewish
neighborhoods

00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:20.896
than Christian neighborhoods,
because the Jewish community

00:27:20.896 --> 00:27:23.370
faced a great deal of
the same discrimination

00:27:23.370 --> 00:27:27.540
that the black
community dealt with.

00:27:27.540 --> 00:27:30.550
You can actually
watch Jewish migration

00:27:30.550 --> 00:27:32.550
follow hand-in-hand
with black migration.

00:27:32.550 --> 00:27:37.770
If you look at the demographics,
it's really interesting.

00:27:37.770 --> 00:27:41.690
12th Street was already a
vibrant business district,

00:27:41.690 --> 00:27:45.300
but was only amplified with
the arrival of black merchants.

00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:47.582
It had everything you
could possibly need.

00:27:47.582 --> 00:27:49.790
There was a saying that if
you needed anything legal,

00:27:49.790 --> 00:27:51.799
you could get it
there during the day.

00:27:51.799 --> 00:27:53.340
Also, if you needed
anything illegal,

00:27:53.340 --> 00:27:55.048
you could probably
get it there at night.

00:27:55.048 --> 00:27:58.590
It was also the home of clubs,
vice, gambling, prostitution,

00:27:58.590 --> 00:28:00.860
and as a result, it garnered
a very seedy reputation

00:28:00.860 --> 00:28:05.340
in the ranks of the
Detroit Police Department.

00:28:05.340 --> 00:28:06.605
Which leads us to '67.

00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:13.800
On July 23, the Detroit
Police Department

00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:16.105
initiated a routine
raid on a blind pig

00:28:16.105 --> 00:28:17.845
near the corner of
12th and Clairmount

00:28:17.845 --> 00:28:20.400
in the Virginia
Park neighborhood.

00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:22.650
There is a great
deal to unpack here.

00:28:22.650 --> 00:28:25.940
Blind pigs were illegal
after-hours clubs

00:28:25.940 --> 00:28:28.110
in the city of Detroit,
both in the white

00:28:28.110 --> 00:28:29.550
and the black neighborhoods.

00:28:29.550 --> 00:28:31.200
They were illegal
for two reasons.

00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:33.270
They didn't have
a liquor license

00:28:33.270 --> 00:28:36.201
and they operated after 2:00 AM.

00:28:36.201 --> 00:28:38.700
Many workers in the city, if
they worked the afternoon shift

00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:41.989
at the factories, got off
about midnight, 1:00 AM.

00:28:41.989 --> 00:28:44.280
As a result, they wanted to
go relax with their friends

00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:48.820
and couldn't do it if
the bars closed at 2:00.

00:28:48.820 --> 00:28:51.390
Blind pigs were prevalent
all across the city.

00:28:51.390 --> 00:28:54.579
This one just happened to be
in the black neighborhood.

00:28:54.579 --> 00:28:56.370
When the police arrived
and scouted it out,

00:28:56.370 --> 00:28:59.220
they expected to
find 10 to 15 people.

00:28:59.220 --> 00:29:03.100
This was routine and easy
work for the Detroit Police

00:29:03.100 --> 00:29:03.600
Department.

00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:06.840
What they would do is,
they'd bust in the door,

00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:10.260
arrest everyone,
charge them $27.50.

00:29:10.260 --> 00:29:13.590
People would pay it right
away, and then the people

00:29:13.590 --> 00:29:15.590
would probably go back
drinking that same night.

00:29:15.590 --> 00:29:18.840
This night didn't go as planned.

00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:21.050
What happened was, when
they raided the blind pig,

00:29:21.050 --> 00:29:24.480
they found 83 people in
a space meant for 40.

00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:28.860
They stumbled upon a party
for two Vietnam vets.

00:29:28.860 --> 00:29:32.760
As a result of the
size of the group

00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:35.880
and how few officers
there were, the arrests

00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:37.050
didn't go as planned.

00:29:37.050 --> 00:29:39.960
They only had one paddy wagon
available to ferry people

00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:42.660
to the 10th Precinct,
so it took over an hour

00:29:42.660 --> 00:29:46.230
to get everyone out of there.

00:29:46.230 --> 00:29:47.730
That caused a great
deal of issues.

00:29:47.730 --> 00:29:49.710
Soon there were more
people on 12th Street

00:29:49.710 --> 00:29:51.630
than police across
the entire city.

00:29:51.630 --> 00:29:54.400
You're probably
asking yourself, why

00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:57.060
were so many people on the
street at 3 o'clock, now

00:29:57.060 --> 00:29:58.770
4 o'clock in the morning?

00:29:58.770 --> 00:30:01.710
It was insanely warm.

00:30:01.710 --> 00:30:03.760
This was before
air conditioning.

00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:05.460
This is a very densely
populated area.

00:30:07.744 --> 00:30:09.660
If you didn't want to
be sweating in your bed,

00:30:09.660 --> 00:30:12.260
you were walking around because
it was cooler to be outside.

00:30:12.260 --> 00:30:14.926
And if you were sweating in your
bed, you had your windows open,

00:30:14.926 --> 00:30:17.810
and you could hear the
commotion really early on.

00:30:17.810 --> 00:30:20.050
And given that this was the
time before cell phones,

00:30:20.050 --> 00:30:22.340
it was better to see
something for yourself

00:30:22.340 --> 00:30:26.010
than to wait for something
to pounce on you.

00:30:26.010 --> 00:30:28.020
As the final arrestees
were loaded up

00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:30.160
and the police cruisers
began driving away,

00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:32.919
a bottle is thrown
by William Scott III

00:30:32.919 --> 00:30:34.960
and shatters the back
window of a police cruiser,

00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:38.280
and the uprising begins.

00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:44.270
It's important to note that,
while '67 was spontaneous,

00:30:44.270 --> 00:30:45.840
there were
longstanding grievances

00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:51.950
that fueled it and maintained
it for the relatively five days

00:30:51.950 --> 00:30:53.670
that it lasted.

00:30:53.670 --> 00:30:56.490
Much of the grievances can be
filed into three categories,

00:30:56.490 --> 00:31:00.050
predatory business owners,
disingenuous landlords,

00:31:00.050 --> 00:31:04.480
and continued terrible
police-community relations.

00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:08.020
We have many stories from
terrible business owners

00:31:08.020 --> 00:31:10.290
in the inner city neighborhoods.

00:31:10.290 --> 00:31:12.090
I interviewed two
Wayne State students

00:31:12.090 --> 00:31:15.630
who spent their free time
going to different A&amp;P markets

00:31:15.630 --> 00:31:17.610
in the inner city
and checking the food

00:31:17.610 --> 00:31:19.130
to make sure it was good still.

00:31:19.130 --> 00:31:22.400
They routinely found moldy
vegetables, moldy fruit,

00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:25.480
expired baby formula.

00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:27.930
Additionally, I
interviewed a principal

00:31:27.930 --> 00:31:31.860
who was principal of Hutchins
Middle School in Virginia Park.

00:31:31.860 --> 00:31:35.730
Someone had recently stolen
all of their musical equipment,

00:31:35.730 --> 00:31:39.150
and one of the kids tracked
it down to a pawn shop.

00:31:39.150 --> 00:31:42.210
As they were pulling
up, the principal said,

00:31:42.210 --> 00:31:44.760
as we were going in the front,
we saw a giant white van drive

00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:47.970
out from the back and all
the instruments were gone.

00:31:47.970 --> 00:31:50.850
When he came back from
vacation after '67,

00:31:50.850 --> 00:31:52.920
he said, that pawn
shop was burned down.

00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:54.870
I'm pretty sure I know
the kid that did it,

00:31:54.870 --> 00:31:56.620
and I would have been
standing next to him

00:31:56.620 --> 00:31:57.703
if I would have been home.

00:32:00.284 --> 00:32:01.950
If you were a person
of color in Detroit

00:32:01.950 --> 00:32:04.035
during the '50s and
'60s, it was well

00:32:04.035 --> 00:32:06.870
known that you would
pay $50 for a $40 house

00:32:06.870 --> 00:32:09.759
in a $30 neighborhood.

00:32:09.759 --> 00:32:12.300
And we're not talking about a
posh apartment with great views

00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:13.530
of the river, either.

00:32:13.530 --> 00:32:14.940
These are subdivided homes.

00:32:14.940 --> 00:32:18.420
These are older apartments that
don't offer the same amenities

00:32:18.420 --> 00:32:19.850
as today.

00:32:19.850 --> 00:32:22.920
Additionally, it was
more expensive to live

00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:24.980
in a subdivided home
in the inner city

00:32:24.980 --> 00:32:27.180
than to have a brand new
house all to yourself

00:32:27.180 --> 00:32:29.210
on the West Side.

00:32:29.210 --> 00:32:32.110
And while '67 may
seem widespread,

00:32:32.110 --> 00:32:34.670
as it touched many
parts of the city,

00:32:34.670 --> 00:32:36.165
only a small
percentage of the city

00:32:36.165 --> 00:32:37.540
was engaged in
what was going on,

00:32:37.540 --> 00:32:40.900
and many honest store
owners and citizens

00:32:40.900 --> 00:32:44.350
got caught in the middle
and lost everything.

00:32:44.350 --> 00:32:45.870
The Detroit Police
Department were

00:32:45.870 --> 00:32:48.570
engaged from the beginning,
along with the Detroit Fire

00:32:48.570 --> 00:32:49.630
Department.

00:32:49.630 --> 00:32:56.435
There were 4,700 Detroit
police officers, 1,200 Detroit

00:32:56.435 --> 00:32:57.420
firemen.

00:32:57.420 --> 00:32:59.940
The Michigan State Police and
the Michigan National Guard

00:32:59.940 --> 00:33:01.420
joined Sunday afternoon.

00:33:01.420 --> 00:33:04.140
1,100 Michigan State
Police came to town.

00:33:04.140 --> 00:33:08.190
7,000 Michigan National
Guardsmen came into the city.

00:33:08.190 --> 00:33:12.312
And on Tuesday morning,
5,000 federal troops

00:33:12.312 --> 00:33:13.020
entered the city.

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:17.990
I mentioned earlier that
the crowd grew faster

00:33:17.990 --> 00:33:19.940
than the police presence did.

00:33:19.940 --> 00:33:21.670
That was not a hard
milestone to meet.

00:33:25.100 --> 00:33:27.970
The police department was at
its lowest amount of officers

00:33:27.970 --> 00:33:30.820
during the week during this
period, and there are only 200

00:33:30.820 --> 00:33:34.727
on duty out of 4,700.

00:33:34.727 --> 00:33:36.560
It was a hot weekend
in July and a whole lot

00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:38.900
of people left to go
fishing, pretty much, which

00:33:38.900 --> 00:33:42.980
caused a very chaotic
situation to unfold with trying

00:33:42.980 --> 00:33:45.820
to deal with the situation.

00:33:45.820 --> 00:33:48.710
As the Detroit Police
Department attempted

00:33:48.710 --> 00:33:50.960
to formulate a
response, civic leaders

00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:53.030
were going into the
community in an attempt

00:33:53.030 --> 00:33:55.630
to get people to go home.

00:33:55.630 --> 00:33:59.270
Freshly elected Congressman
John Conyers and Arthur

00:33:59.270 --> 00:34:03.280
Johnson, head of the NAACP in
Detroit, go to 12th Street,

00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:06.090
they stand on the top
of Art Johnson's car,

00:34:06.090 --> 00:34:07.870
and they beg and plead
folks to go home.

00:34:07.870 --> 00:34:09.050
They said, we're going
to make this right.

00:34:09.050 --> 00:34:10.110
It's going to work.

00:34:10.110 --> 00:34:11.859
They were actually
shouted down and pelted

00:34:11.859 --> 00:34:14.679
with whatever people could
find, and they get out of there.

00:34:14.679 --> 00:34:16.685
John Conyers would
later say he didn't even

00:34:16.685 --> 00:34:19.730
think that Malcolm X could have
gotten those people to go home.

00:34:19.730 --> 00:34:23.179
While they're doing that,
local pastors are organizing

00:34:23.179 --> 00:34:25.190
in an attempt to get
people to go home,

00:34:25.190 --> 00:34:28.780
and Mayor Cavanagh
and not-yet-judge,

00:34:28.780 --> 00:34:32.080
but soon-to-be Judge
Damon J. Keith,

00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:35.810
are calling every radio station,
every television station,

00:34:35.810 --> 00:34:37.639
every newspaper,
anyone who talks

00:34:37.639 --> 00:34:39.800
to the public en masse,
and telling them,

00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:42.280
do not say the word riot.

00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:44.179
Don't talk about the smoke.

00:34:44.179 --> 00:34:46.040
Don't talk about fires.

00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:48.679
Just say, hey, today is
a great day to go home.

00:34:48.679 --> 00:34:51.860
Everyone should just go home
and just stay in their house.

00:34:51.860 --> 00:34:54.380
They're also calling preachers
and asking them to slip

00:34:54.380 --> 00:34:56.300
that in their sermon as well.

00:34:56.300 --> 00:34:58.640
After '67, they would
also ask preachers

00:34:58.640 --> 00:35:01.137
to slip into their sermon,
if you stole anything,

00:35:01.137 --> 00:35:03.220
drop it off at night and
you won't get in trouble.

00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:10.700
So as this is going on, the
Detroit Police Department

00:35:10.700 --> 00:35:12.360
is assembling some
of its officers back

00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:16.280
and they attempt to
essentially retake

00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:21.080
Virginia Park, because
police and firemen withdraw

00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:26.530
from the area because they
can't formulate a response.

00:35:26.530 --> 00:35:29.950
As the police go to sweep the
streets in this formation right

00:35:29.950 --> 00:35:34.480
here, their crowd control fell
apart in roughly 20 minutes.

00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:36.320
And that's from the
Special Assistant

00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:38.024
to the Police Commissioner.

00:35:38.024 --> 00:35:39.440
What happened was,
when the police

00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:41.257
would line up to
sweep the streets,

00:35:41.257 --> 00:35:43.340
they didn't have anyone
to cover the side streets.

00:35:43.340 --> 00:35:45.164
So the crowd would
split in half,

00:35:45.164 --> 00:35:46.580
they would run
down the alleyways,

00:35:46.580 --> 00:35:49.680
and get right back
up behind them,

00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:53.810
making crowd control
seemingly impossible.

00:35:53.810 --> 00:35:56.990
When the National
Guard came to town,

00:35:56.990 --> 00:36:00.066
they not only came to town with
no formal training whatsoever

00:36:00.066 --> 00:36:01.690
in how to handle
this, but many of them

00:36:01.690 --> 00:36:05.160
had not experienced two
things before in their lives.

00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:06.890
But first, the training.

00:36:06.890 --> 00:36:10.640
That's a big claim to make, and
I have evidence to back it up.

00:36:10.640 --> 00:36:13.680
We have an interview with a man
who was with the Michigan Air

00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:17.510
National Guard,
and his job was, he

00:36:17.510 --> 00:36:18.984
was a clerk at Metro Airport.

00:36:18.984 --> 00:36:20.900
He would drive to Metro
Airport every weekend,

00:36:20.900 --> 00:36:23.660
push papers for them,
and then go home.

00:36:23.660 --> 00:36:27.390
That Sunday, he arrived at
Metro Airport to push papers,

00:36:27.390 --> 00:36:29.900
and the commanding officer
came into the office, ordered

00:36:29.900 --> 00:36:32.670
everyone down onto the tarmac.

00:36:32.670 --> 00:36:34.880
They taught them how
to march for two hours,

00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:39.860
gave them guns, and shipped
them downtown, without bullets.

00:36:39.860 --> 00:36:43.010
We have other stories of
other National Guardsmen

00:36:43.010 --> 00:36:44.990
who were trained how
to fight the Soviets,

00:36:44.990 --> 00:36:47.300
not patrol the
streets of Detroit.

00:36:47.300 --> 00:36:51.710
Further complicating the
no-training-for-this was

00:36:51.710 --> 00:36:54.530
the fact that many National
Guardsmen were from western

00:36:54.530 --> 00:36:56.540
and northern rural Michigan.

00:36:56.540 --> 00:36:59.680
Many had not seen a building
taller than six stories,

00:36:59.680 --> 00:37:02.270
let alone more than one next
to each other, and many of them

00:37:02.270 --> 00:37:04.972
had not seen a
black person before.

00:37:04.972 --> 00:37:06.680
They came into town
with nothing but fear

00:37:06.680 --> 00:37:09.590
and stereotypes, which I
can say did not lend itself

00:37:09.590 --> 00:37:10.786
well to the situation.

00:37:14.260 --> 00:37:19.550
And complicating everything
is politics, because why not?

00:37:19.550 --> 00:37:22.840
Bottom right is Mayor
Jerome Cavanagh, Democrat.

00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:25.540
Middle is Governor
George Romney, father

00:37:25.540 --> 00:37:27.690
of Mitt Romney, Republican.

00:37:27.690 --> 00:37:31.510
And top left is President
Lyndon Johnson, Democrat.

00:37:31.510 --> 00:37:35.200
This is before
the 1968 election.

00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:38.130
Johnson has not yet announced
he will not seek re-election,

00:37:38.130 --> 00:37:40.156
or maybe he hasn't decided yet.

00:37:40.156 --> 00:37:41.530
Romney has announced
that he will

00:37:41.530 --> 00:37:44.700
be seeking the Republican
nomination for president.

00:37:44.700 --> 00:37:48.760
And Cavanagh is being touted as
a possible primary challenger

00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:51.660
to Johnson, because Johnson
is incredibly unpopular due

00:37:51.660 --> 00:37:53.680
to the Vietnam War.

00:37:53.680 --> 00:37:57.580
And Johnson knows all of that.

00:37:57.580 --> 00:38:00.524
Very quickly, Cavanagh begins
clamoring for state aid,

00:38:00.524 --> 00:38:02.440
because the police
department can't handle it.

00:38:02.440 --> 00:38:04.210
Romney is more than
happy to come to town

00:38:04.210 --> 00:38:06.130
because he wants this
as a feather in his cap

00:38:06.130 --> 00:38:08.890
when he runs as the
law-and-order candidate in '68,

00:38:08.890 --> 00:38:12.730
which is what Richard
Nixon will do.

00:38:12.730 --> 00:38:15.340
Very quickly, it becomes evident
that the National Guard can't

00:38:15.340 --> 00:38:17.150
handle the situation,
and Cavanagh

00:38:17.150 --> 00:38:21.040
begins clamoring for
federal intervention.

00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:25.420
Johnson and Romney both
don't want to do that.

00:38:25.420 --> 00:38:29.410
Romney doesn't want him to do it
because that would mean Johnson

00:38:29.410 --> 00:38:31.270
stealing his
victory, and Johnson

00:38:31.270 --> 00:38:33.970
doesn't want to do it
because Romney and Cavanagh's

00:38:33.970 --> 00:38:38.580
political careers are burning
down with the city of Detroit.

00:38:38.580 --> 00:38:41.920
Eventually, Romney agrees
and sends a telegram

00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:44.230
to Johnson recommending
the use of federal troops

00:38:44.230 --> 00:38:46.200
in the city of Detroit.

00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:48.040
Johnson sends a
telegram back saying,

00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:50.340
you do not recommended
to the president.

00:38:50.340 --> 00:38:52.950
He sends another one requesting
the use of federal troops

00:38:52.950 --> 00:38:56.900
in the city of Detroit, and
he agrees to it technically.

00:38:56.900 --> 00:39:01.090
5,000 troops are sent
to Selfridge Air Force

00:39:01.090 --> 00:39:11.822
Base as part of
Task Force Detroit,

00:39:11.822 --> 00:39:13.780
and they were sent to
Selfridge Air Force Base,

00:39:13.780 --> 00:39:15.910
20 miles outside the city
limits of Detroit, where

00:39:15.910 --> 00:39:17.980
they're not allowed to leave.

00:39:17.980 --> 00:39:22.130
Only two officials come to
the city, Gen. Throckmorton

00:39:22.130 --> 00:39:26.170
and Cyrus Vance, who patrol
the city Monday night with city

00:39:26.170 --> 00:39:28.920
officials and Romney--

00:39:28.920 --> 00:39:30.100
well, Monday afternoon.

00:39:30.100 --> 00:39:31.286
And they see nothing.

00:39:31.286 --> 00:39:33.160
They don't see fires,
they don't see looting.

00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:34.360
They got a flat tire.

00:39:34.360 --> 00:39:36.580
That was about it.

00:39:36.580 --> 00:39:38.920
They announced
that, we missed it.

00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:40.452
Sorry, guys, we came so late.

00:39:40.452 --> 00:39:42.160
The situation seemed
to be under control.

00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:43.280
Cavanagh is freaking out.

00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:44.839
He's like, it's not over.

00:39:44.839 --> 00:39:45.880
This happened last night.

00:39:45.880 --> 00:39:46.547
It's a lull.

00:39:46.547 --> 00:39:48.130
I promise you it's
going to get worse.

00:39:48.130 --> 00:39:49.199
Romney is pretty pleased.

00:39:49.199 --> 00:39:50.740
He's like, thank
you guys for coming.

00:39:50.740 --> 00:39:52.855
We have the situation handled.

00:39:52.855 --> 00:39:55.020
It's all good.

00:39:55.020 --> 00:39:57.000
They announce the federal
government will not

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:00.730
be stepping in, federal troops
will be leaving again soon.

00:40:00.730 --> 00:40:03.320
And Monday night is the
worst night of the uprising.

00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:05.380
Soon, they change their
tune, and federal troops

00:40:05.380 --> 00:40:12.700
take over the East Side on
Tuesday morning, about 2:00 AM.

00:40:12.700 --> 00:40:14.380
While the city is
calming down, we

00:40:14.380 --> 00:40:16.450
have one of the,
if not the worst,

00:40:16.450 --> 00:40:20.970
incidents of the uprising, the
Algiers Motel Incident and/or

00:40:20.970 --> 00:40:22.130
the Algiers Motel Massacre.

00:40:26.390 --> 00:40:29.690
Wednesday morning,
there are reports

00:40:29.690 --> 00:40:33.890
of sniper fire coming from
near the area of the Algiers.

00:40:33.890 --> 00:40:37.340
A National Guard unit, a
Michigan State Police unit,

00:40:37.340 --> 00:40:41.270
three Detroit police officers,
a black security guard,

00:40:41.270 --> 00:40:44.730
and two military M.P.s
converge on the Algiers,

00:40:44.730 --> 00:40:50.070
believing it to be the
source of the sniper fire.

00:40:50.070 --> 00:40:52.700
The Detroit Police Department
are the first ones in the door.

00:40:55.310 --> 00:40:59.890
And this is where multiple
stories start to emerge,

00:40:59.890 --> 00:41:03.200
but the best information
we have is this.

00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:06.690
They find Carl Cooper coming
either down the stairs

00:41:06.690 --> 00:41:09.560
or around from the stairs, and
they shoot him in the chest,

00:41:09.560 --> 00:41:11.240
killing him.

00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:15.480
Next, they find Fred Temple on
the phone with his girlfriend,

00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:17.960
and they shoot him in the chest.

00:41:17.960 --> 00:41:20.660
They finish sweeping the rest
of the first floor, then order

00:41:20.660 --> 00:41:23.360
everyone to come downstairs.

00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:25.560
They line everyone
up against the wall.

00:41:25.560 --> 00:41:28.980
Left are two white women
and seven black men.

00:41:28.980 --> 00:41:32.150
They begin beating and
berating those along the wall.

00:41:32.150 --> 00:41:35.060
The Detroit Police Department
are leading the effort.

00:41:35.060 --> 00:41:38.240
They specifically target the two
white women, repeatedly asking

00:41:38.240 --> 00:41:41.259
them, why aren't white
men good enough for you?

00:41:41.259 --> 00:41:42.800
Why are you cavorting
with black men?

00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:43.980
What are you doing?

00:41:43.980 --> 00:41:46.880
They would strip
them and beat them.

00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:50.050
This is when the military
M.P.s left and, quote,

00:41:50.050 --> 00:41:52.230
"Things took an ugly turn."

00:41:52.230 --> 00:41:53.900
The last thing a
military M.P. saw

00:41:53.900 --> 00:41:55.674
was a Detroit police
officer holding

00:41:55.674 --> 00:41:57.590
a shotgun between a man's
legs and threatening

00:41:57.590 --> 00:42:00.080
to blow his balls off.

00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:01.520
Next up, the
Michigan State Police

00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:03.567
go out to their commanding
officer and say,

00:42:03.567 --> 00:42:05.900
the Detroit Police Department
is committing civil rights

00:42:05.900 --> 00:42:06.470
violations.

00:42:06.470 --> 00:42:07.678
They're beating those people.

00:42:07.678 --> 00:42:08.625
What do we do?

00:42:08.625 --> 00:42:10.000
The commanding
officer says, that

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:12.650
sounds like a Detroit
Police Department problem.

00:42:12.650 --> 00:42:15.020
And they all leave.

00:42:15.020 --> 00:42:16.880
Left are the three
Detroit police officers,

00:42:16.880 --> 00:42:23.720
led by Officer Senak, and
the National Guard unit,

00:42:23.720 --> 00:42:25.570
and the black security guard.

00:42:25.570 --> 00:42:28.930
And this is when the
execution game begins.

00:42:28.930 --> 00:42:32.782
Senak pulls a man into a side
room and pretends to shoot him.

00:42:32.782 --> 00:42:34.240
When he comes out,
he says, this is

00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:36.448
what happens when you don't
tell me where the gun is.

00:42:36.448 --> 00:42:37.719
He should have cooperated.

00:42:37.719 --> 00:42:39.760
He winks at the leader of
the National Guard, who

00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:44.320
takes another man into a side
room and pretends to shoot him.

00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:47.510
Officer Senak then
asks Officer Paille

00:42:47.510 --> 00:42:49.960
if he feels like
shooting anybody today.

00:42:49.960 --> 00:42:54.430
Officer Paille grabs
a man off the wall,

00:42:54.430 --> 00:42:58.100
throws him into a side room--

00:42:58.100 --> 00:43:02.560
throws him into the same room
as a now-dying Fred Temple,

00:43:02.560 --> 00:43:06.880
and he shoots Aubrey Pollard
in the chest, killing him.

00:43:06.880 --> 00:43:10.630
All this takes place
within roughly 30 minutes.

00:43:10.630 --> 00:43:13.750
The National Guard take
the two white women away

00:43:13.750 --> 00:43:16.300
and the rest of the men
are ordered to leave.

00:43:16.300 --> 00:43:20.500
This is successfully covered
up for about five days.

00:43:20.500 --> 00:43:23.777
The three men are listed
as riot-related casualties.

00:43:23.777 --> 00:43:26.110
It's said that they got into
a firefight with each other

00:43:26.110 --> 00:43:27.026
and killed each other.

00:43:30.010 --> 00:43:33.860
That is called in by the
clerk of the motel, as ruled

00:43:33.860 --> 00:43:35.590
by the Wayne County coroner.

00:43:35.590 --> 00:43:37.570
The families reject
this immediately.

00:43:37.570 --> 00:43:40.300
They think it's one of the most
foolish things they've ever

00:43:40.300 --> 00:43:41.040
heard.

00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:43.350
They are able to sneak
back into the Algiers,

00:43:43.350 --> 00:43:45.850
take their own photographs,
do their own investigation.

00:43:45.850 --> 00:43:48.240
The "News" breaks the
story and the "Free Press"

00:43:48.240 --> 00:43:50.240
carries it home.

00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:53.250
Soon, two of the officers
confess to what they did,

00:43:53.250 --> 00:43:55.990
Officer Paille and
Officer August.

00:43:55.990 --> 00:43:59.590
And Senak is about to
confess before his confession

00:43:59.590 --> 00:44:01.889
is interrupted by
his defense attorney.

00:44:01.889 --> 00:44:04.180
Those two officers are brought
up on charges in Detroit

00:44:04.180 --> 00:44:05.777
and acquitted.

00:44:05.777 --> 00:44:08.110
The three Detroit police
officers and the black security

00:44:08.110 --> 00:44:10.480
guard are brought up
on federal charges

00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:13.320
and the trial is moved to
all-white Mason, Michigan,

00:44:13.320 --> 00:44:16.320
where another all-white
jury acquits all four men.

00:44:19.117 --> 00:44:21.200
The Detroit police were
racist, the National Guard

00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:22.575
didn't know what
they were doing,

00:44:22.575 --> 00:44:24.140
and the federal
troops put it down.

00:44:24.140 --> 00:44:26.610
I heard this more than once,
conducting the oral history

00:44:26.610 --> 00:44:29.840
project and doing my own
independent research.

00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:32.370
It holds up fairly well.

00:44:32.370 --> 00:44:35.670
Officially, 43
dead, nearly 1,200

00:44:35.670 --> 00:44:39.480
injured, over 7,200 arrested,
and as you can probably guess,

00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:42.570
there aren't that many jail
cells in the city of Detroit,

00:44:42.570 --> 00:44:46.740
nor are there that many
in southeastern Michigan.

00:44:46.740 --> 00:44:53.026
Arrestees were picked up for
not only looting and arson

00:44:53.026 --> 00:44:54.900
and stuff like that,
but the majority of them

00:44:54.900 --> 00:44:56.670
were picked up for
a curfew violation.

00:44:56.670 --> 00:44:59.850
If you were out past
9:00 or out before 5:00,

00:44:59.850 --> 00:45:01.650
you were most likely
rounded up en masse

00:45:01.650 --> 00:45:03.155
and arrested as
quickly as possible

00:45:03.155 --> 00:45:04.238
to get you off the street.

00:45:08.070 --> 00:45:10.320
Many people who
were arrested were

00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:13.020
thrown in makeshift
facilities and packed in there

00:45:13.020 --> 00:45:14.860
as tightly as possible.

00:45:14.860 --> 00:45:17.510
They were put in basements,
they were put in garages,

00:45:17.510 --> 00:45:20.920
they were put in cages,
they were put in buses.

00:45:20.920 --> 00:45:22.830
Belle Isle became a
major holding facility

00:45:22.830 --> 00:45:26.550
later in the week, and it
was nicknamed Bellecatraz.

00:45:26.550 --> 00:45:30.660
And the conditions were not
very favorable to them at all.

00:45:30.660 --> 00:45:33.790
I interviewed one man who was
kept in the garage for a day,

00:45:33.790 --> 00:45:36.250
and the only fresh air they
got when someone mouthed off

00:45:36.250 --> 00:45:38.749
to the police and they closed
the doors, was they were given

00:45:38.749 --> 00:45:41.525
a hose to flush the drain they
were all going to the bathroom

00:45:41.525 --> 00:45:42.110
in.

00:45:42.110 --> 00:45:43.530
They would take that hose
and they would hold it up

00:45:43.530 --> 00:45:45.385
to their nose so they could
breathe the fresh air that

00:45:45.385 --> 00:45:46.730
was coming out with the water.

00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:52.335
One of the major
things people point

00:45:52.335 --> 00:45:54.710
to is increased white flight--
was white flight beginning

00:45:54.710 --> 00:45:57.710
in '67, but it
increased for sure.

00:45:57.710 --> 00:46:00.450
And the proliferation of
firearms across the city

00:46:00.450 --> 00:46:03.170
was a major, major
moment for the city.

00:46:03.170 --> 00:46:07.060
There were more handguns sold
in the first six months of 1968

00:46:07.060 --> 00:46:09.410
than the entire year of 1967.

00:46:09.410 --> 00:46:11.345
That masks the real
number of guns sold,

00:46:11.345 --> 00:46:14.310
because it was far easier
to buy guns in Toledo

00:46:14.310 --> 00:46:15.380
than it was in Detroit.

00:46:15.380 --> 00:46:17.610
So many people would simply
drive the 45 minutes down

00:46:17.610 --> 00:46:22.220
to Toledo, buy their
guns, and come back.

00:46:22.220 --> 00:46:25.085
The, same is true for long guns
such as rifles and shotguns

00:46:25.085 --> 00:46:25.801
as well.

00:46:28.045 --> 00:46:29.670
There are many myths
and misconceptions

00:46:29.670 --> 00:46:31.070
that surround '67.

00:46:31.070 --> 00:46:32.550
That's part of the
reason we really

00:46:32.550 --> 00:46:34.620
wanted to do this project.

00:46:34.620 --> 00:46:38.790
In terms of looting,
many people immediately

00:46:38.790 --> 00:46:43.020
believe or assume that the
black community were the looters

00:46:43.020 --> 00:46:44.305
during '67.

00:46:44.305 --> 00:46:45.720
Looting was highly integrated.

00:46:45.720 --> 00:46:48.720
Hubert Locke, who was the
Special Assistant to the Police

00:46:48.720 --> 00:46:51.490
Commissioner, would
say in his oral history

00:46:51.490 --> 00:46:53.880
that he thinks '67 was one
of the most integrated things

00:46:53.880 --> 00:46:55.680
Detroit has ever done.

00:46:55.680 --> 00:46:59.012
One of the first things
he saw was a picture

00:46:59.012 --> 00:47:01.220
of two white guys and two
black eyes running past him

00:47:01.220 --> 00:47:02.290
with a couch.

00:47:02.290 --> 00:47:05.190
He's like, that's new.

00:47:05.190 --> 00:47:07.670
Additionally, pawn shops played
a really interesting role

00:47:07.670 --> 00:47:08.970
in the spread of looting.

00:47:08.970 --> 00:47:11.370
The activist General Baker
talks about how pawning

00:47:11.370 --> 00:47:13.760
was the central pillar of
his community's economy

00:47:13.760 --> 00:47:16.280
at the time.

00:47:16.280 --> 00:47:17.929
And on the back of
every pawn slip,

00:47:17.929 --> 00:47:20.220
it would say, "Will not
replace in case of fire, theft,

00:47:20.220 --> 00:47:20.560
or flood."

00:47:20.560 --> 00:47:22.510
So a bunch of his
neighbors looked at them,

00:47:22.510 --> 00:47:24.194
and would say to
each other, well,

00:47:24.194 --> 00:47:26.610
if someone's going to steal
my stuff, it's going to be me.

00:47:26.610 --> 00:47:29.340
And pawn shops were, in fact,
some of the first places hit,

00:47:29.340 --> 00:47:32.190
because many residents were
running in, stealing their item

00:47:32.190 --> 00:47:33.560
back, and going home.

00:47:33.560 --> 00:47:36.110
But seeing 40 people rush
into a store, especially

00:47:36.110 --> 00:47:40.880
multiple stores, doesn't really
bode well for the situation.

00:47:40.880 --> 00:47:43.080
Additionally, we have
anecdotal evidence--

00:47:43.080 --> 00:47:44.760
we don't have any
hard evidence yet--

00:47:44.760 --> 00:47:46.890
of interstate looters.

00:47:46.890 --> 00:47:49.686
I interviewed one man by the
name of John Eddings, who

00:47:49.686 --> 00:47:51.060
lived off of
Linwood at the time,

00:47:51.060 --> 00:47:52.610
and as he was
driving over Linwood,

00:47:52.610 --> 00:47:53.693
he looked down the street.

00:47:53.693 --> 00:47:55.670
He had never seen so
many out-of-state license

00:47:55.670 --> 00:47:56.910
plates in his life.

00:47:56.910 --> 00:48:01.570
Ohio, Illinois, Indiana were all
represented at noon on Sunday.

00:48:01.570 --> 00:48:04.680
Additionally, we have
another story from a man

00:48:04.680 --> 00:48:06.510
by the name of
Richard Rybinski, who

00:48:06.510 --> 00:48:08.640
lived in Midtown at the time.

00:48:08.640 --> 00:48:10.850
And he was like, I'm tired
of listening to the radio.

00:48:10.850 --> 00:48:12.610
I really got to figure out
what's going on for myself.

00:48:12.610 --> 00:48:13.985
So he hops on his
bike and starts

00:48:13.985 --> 00:48:15.591
riding around the neighborhood.

00:48:15.591 --> 00:48:17.090
One of the times
he's riding around,

00:48:17.090 --> 00:48:18.530
he's standing at
a street corner,

00:48:18.530 --> 00:48:20.738
and a station wagon pulls
up with a trailer attached,

00:48:20.738 --> 00:48:22.340
an Ohio license
plate on the front,

00:48:22.340 --> 00:48:24.240
and two old white guys
in the seats, asking,

00:48:24.240 --> 00:48:25.506
where's the looting at?

00:48:29.080 --> 00:48:32.295
I'm sure many of you have
seen videos from '67,

00:48:32.295 --> 00:48:37.170
and the fire sticks
out pretty prevalently.

00:48:37.170 --> 00:48:39.960
We have stories of those
fires being intentionally set

00:48:39.960 --> 00:48:42.130
for insurance money.

00:48:42.130 --> 00:48:45.285
The problem was, if you
burned down one building,

00:48:45.285 --> 00:48:47.054
you would most likely
burn down a strip.

00:48:47.054 --> 00:48:48.470
And if you burned
down that strip,

00:48:48.470 --> 00:48:51.750
you'd most likely burn down the
residential areas behind it.

00:48:51.750 --> 00:48:55.200
Detroit was built
incredibly packed in,

00:48:55.200 --> 00:48:58.890
and it was very
warm and very dry.

00:48:58.890 --> 00:49:01.680
The wind was so strong that
it would often carry fire

00:49:01.680 --> 00:49:04.364
over a building to hit another.

00:49:04.364 --> 00:49:05.780
That's why if
you're ever looking,

00:49:05.780 --> 00:49:07.988
and you're like, how did
that one house in the middle

00:49:07.988 --> 00:49:08.700
survive?

00:49:08.700 --> 00:49:10.350
It's because the wind literally
picked it up and brought it

00:49:10.350 --> 00:49:10.850
over.

00:49:13.530 --> 00:49:16.050
Furthermore, fire was
not the only major cause

00:49:16.050 --> 00:49:17.880
of damage in the city.

00:49:17.880 --> 00:49:19.290
Bullets were.

00:49:19.290 --> 00:49:21.230
In five days, the
Michigan National Guard

00:49:21.230 --> 00:49:24.450
shot off 155,000 rounds.

00:49:24.450 --> 00:49:26.060
That number always blew my mind.

00:49:26.060 --> 00:49:27.930
I was like, how
is that possible?

00:49:27.930 --> 00:49:30.096
In speaking with a man who
trained with the National

00:49:30.096 --> 00:49:33.830
Guard, the tactic at the time
was, if someone shoots at you,

00:49:33.830 --> 00:49:35.580
80% of the people
you're with begin

00:49:35.580 --> 00:49:38.120
shooting in that general
vicinity, and the other 20%

00:49:38.120 --> 00:49:39.510
move to flank.

00:49:39.510 --> 00:49:42.000
So if you got shot
at, you're unleashing

00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:44.670
dozens, if not hundreds, of
bullets in the general area,

00:49:44.670 --> 00:49:46.710
inflicting great deal of damage.

00:49:46.710 --> 00:49:52.290
Additionally, the favorite
target of National Guardsmen

00:49:52.290 --> 00:49:53.442
were street lights.

00:49:53.442 --> 00:49:55.400
It was believed that if
a sniper could see you,

00:49:55.400 --> 00:49:56.762
a sniper could shoot you.

00:49:56.762 --> 00:49:58.470
So they would shoot
out the street lights

00:49:58.470 --> 00:49:59.928
where they were
stationed and where

00:49:59.928 --> 00:50:02.790
they were patrolling
Grand River, Woodward,

00:50:02.790 --> 00:50:05.550
Jefferson all had their
street lights shot out.

00:50:05.550 --> 00:50:09.370
And where they were stationed
were civic buildings.

00:50:09.370 --> 00:50:12.660
They were stationed at parks,
schools, other government

00:50:12.660 --> 00:50:15.630
buildings, civic centers, that
all had their floodlights shot

00:50:15.630 --> 00:50:18.000
out as well, and they
certainly didn't replace them

00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:19.170
when they left.

00:50:19.170 --> 00:50:22.740
That same principal I mentioned
earlier, so when he came home,

00:50:22.740 --> 00:50:24.510
he went straight to the school.

00:50:24.510 --> 00:50:26.490
He looked up, he
said, not only were

00:50:26.490 --> 00:50:29.150
all my floodlights shot up,
but my building was shot up,

00:50:29.150 --> 00:50:33.270
because they couldn't
hit the damn floodlights.

00:50:33.270 --> 00:50:37.590
Sniping, in regards to '67,
is incredibly confusing.

00:50:37.590 --> 00:50:39.120
Sniping is misleading.

00:50:39.120 --> 00:50:40.560
We have a lot of
shooters in '67.

00:50:40.560 --> 00:50:43.410
Snipers are good shots.

00:50:43.410 --> 00:50:46.920
The primary target of those
shooters were fire trucks.

00:50:46.920 --> 00:50:48.882
So when the firemen
would pull up,

00:50:48.882 --> 00:50:50.340
they'd start shooting
at the truck,

00:50:50.340 --> 00:50:51.540
and the firemen would leave.

00:50:51.540 --> 00:50:53.150
So the question is, why
were they doing that?

00:50:53.150 --> 00:50:55.650
Were they simply trying to stop
people from authorities from

00:50:55.650 --> 00:50:57.150
coming back into
the neighborhood?

00:50:57.150 --> 00:51:00.110
Were they trying to stop
that fire from being put out?

00:51:00.110 --> 00:51:00.910
We don't know.

00:51:00.910 --> 00:51:01.660
I haven't met one.

00:51:01.660 --> 00:51:04.540
I would love to speak
with a sniper just

00:51:04.540 --> 00:51:08.090
to get their motivation down.

00:51:08.090 --> 00:51:10.590
Additionally, the majority of
people arrested for sniping

00:51:10.590 --> 00:51:12.179
were white.

00:51:12.179 --> 00:51:14.220
And then the biggest myth
or misconception of all

00:51:14.220 --> 00:51:16.640
is that white flight
started in '67

00:51:16.640 --> 00:51:20.040
and the city was hunky
dory before that.

00:51:20.040 --> 00:51:22.970
Throughout this presentation,
I have used the term uprising.

00:51:22.970 --> 00:51:24.780
That is a conscious decision.

00:51:24.780 --> 00:51:27.790
There are four main terms used
to describe what took place.

00:51:27.790 --> 00:51:32.990
Uprising, riot, rebellion,
and civil unrest/disturbance.

00:51:32.990 --> 00:51:36.190
Riot is primarily used by the
white community, suburbanites,

00:51:36.190 --> 00:51:39.100
and political conservatives.

00:51:39.100 --> 00:51:40.660
It focuses on the
spontaneity of what

00:51:40.660 --> 00:51:42.965
happened, the criminality
of what took place, and lays

00:51:42.965 --> 00:51:44.381
the majority of
the blame for what

00:51:44.381 --> 00:51:46.730
happened at the feet
of the black community.

00:51:46.730 --> 00:51:50.490
Rebellion is primarily used
by the black community,

00:51:50.490 --> 00:51:52.990
Detroiters, and
political progressives.

00:51:52.990 --> 00:51:55.710
It focuses not so much
on the spontaneity,

00:51:55.710 --> 00:51:57.880
but the reasons
and the historical

00:51:57.880 --> 00:51:59.435
grievances that fueled it.

00:51:59.435 --> 00:52:02.410
It sidesteps the
damage and pushback

00:52:02.410 --> 00:52:04.720
as part of the
righteous struggle,

00:52:04.720 --> 00:52:06.790
and also lays the
majority of the blame

00:52:06.790 --> 00:52:08.890
at the feet of the white
community for allowing

00:52:08.890 --> 00:52:13.270
the conditions to persist long
enough to spark such an event.

00:52:13.270 --> 00:52:16.400
Uprising is an
amalgam of the two.

00:52:16.400 --> 00:52:18.320
It says, while it
was spontaneous,

00:52:18.320 --> 00:52:20.890
it was fueled by longstanding
grievances that permeated

00:52:20.890 --> 00:52:23.650
through the community.

00:52:23.650 --> 00:52:26.065
It accepts that in
violent uprisings,

00:52:26.065 --> 00:52:30.190
criminality and damage
happens, but it also divvies up

00:52:30.190 --> 00:52:33.760
the blame for not only what took
place, but how it played out.

00:52:33.760 --> 00:52:36.010
And that usually depends on
whoever you're talking to

00:52:36.010 --> 00:52:39.160
at that particular moment.

00:52:39.160 --> 00:52:41.902
Civil disturbance is used
by usually people who

00:52:41.902 --> 00:52:44.360
aren't trying to take a side,
just like journalists or news

00:52:44.360 --> 00:52:46.859
anchors, or people who are just
trying to make a quick point

00:52:46.859 --> 00:52:48.800
and then move on.

00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:51.250
There are problems
with all of them.

00:52:51.250 --> 00:52:55.456
People who use the term riot
don't like the term uprising

00:52:55.456 --> 00:52:56.830
or rebellion
because they believe

00:52:56.830 --> 00:53:00.650
it lets criminals off the
hook, and allows lazy people

00:53:00.650 --> 00:53:02.000
to continue to be lazy.

00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:04.720
People who use the term
rebellion don't like the term

00:53:04.720 --> 00:53:06.420
uprising, because
they believe it

00:53:06.420 --> 00:53:10.760
dilutes the black
community's right to rebel.

00:53:10.760 --> 00:53:13.240
So many people find
problems with these terms.

00:53:13.240 --> 00:53:15.760
But as long as we understand
the perspective that

00:53:15.760 --> 00:53:21.280
leads to each term, it allows
for much greater conversation.

00:53:21.280 --> 00:53:23.160
Insurrection,
revolution, and war

00:53:23.160 --> 00:53:25.660
were also used during
this week, and also

00:53:25.660 --> 00:53:27.580
used to describe this week.

00:53:27.580 --> 00:53:29.581
At the bottom, race
riot is grayed out.

00:53:29.581 --> 00:53:31.080
We at the Detroit
Historical Society

00:53:31.080 --> 00:53:34.372
do not believe what took
place in '67 was a race riot.

00:53:34.372 --> 00:53:36.330
It wasn't, get that police
officer, he's white.

00:53:36.330 --> 00:53:37.310
It's, get that
police officer, he's

00:53:37.310 --> 00:53:38.720
been beating me up for 20 years.

00:53:38.720 --> 00:53:40.600
It wasn't, get that
store owner, he's white.

00:53:40.600 --> 00:53:44.412
It's, get that store owner,
he helped sell my instruments

00:53:44.412 --> 00:53:45.120
that were stolen.

00:53:45.120 --> 00:53:47.020
Stuff like that.

00:53:47.020 --> 00:53:49.090
It was far more
anti-authoritarian,

00:53:49.090 --> 00:53:55.160
and anti-authority,
than based on race.

00:53:55.160 --> 00:53:58.895
It's important for us to be able
to frame and conceptualize '67,

00:53:58.895 --> 00:54:01.210
because other people
are doing it for us.

00:54:01.210 --> 00:54:03.652
"Life" magazine called it
a revolt. "Time" magazine

00:54:03.652 --> 00:54:04.360
called it a riot.

00:54:04.360 --> 00:54:06.410
Kathryn Bigelow called it a war.

00:54:06.410 --> 00:54:10.642
So, it doesn't really matter if
we have different perspectives

00:54:10.642 --> 00:54:12.350
on it, as long as the
we have the ability

00:54:12.350 --> 00:54:18.764
to understand the various
perspectives that surround '67.

00:54:18.764 --> 00:54:20.180
For all the the
destructive things

00:54:20.180 --> 00:54:24.690
that came about in '67, for
all the destructive things that

00:54:24.690 --> 00:54:27.160
came about because of '67,
many constructive things

00:54:27.160 --> 00:54:28.370
happened as well.

00:54:28.370 --> 00:54:31.790
Detroit has always been
an activist town and that

00:54:31.790 --> 00:54:33.610
didn't change with '67.

00:54:33.610 --> 00:54:35.790
There are a huge
number of organizations

00:54:35.790 --> 00:54:38.270
that stepped up to the
plate and organized in order

00:54:38.270 --> 00:54:41.450
to help bring the city
back from seemingly

00:54:41.450 --> 00:54:44.350
the brink of the abyss.

00:54:44.350 --> 00:54:45.740
At the institutional
level, there

00:54:45.740 --> 00:54:49.280
was New Detroit and Focus HOPE.

00:54:49.280 --> 00:54:51.710
Also, the election of
Coleman Young in 1974

00:54:51.710 --> 00:54:53.660
did a great deal for the city.

00:54:53.660 --> 00:54:56.750
And that's really all I usually
say about Coleman Young,

00:54:56.750 --> 00:54:58.890
because in this town, you
either love Coleman Young

00:54:58.890 --> 00:55:01.660
or you hate Coleman Young,
and everyone will grandstand

00:55:01.660 --> 00:55:04.430
till the end of time itself.

00:55:04.430 --> 00:55:07.686
But grassroots activism
was where it's at.

00:55:07.686 --> 00:55:09.560
Ad-Hoc Detroit was
founded by Sheila Cockrell

00:55:09.560 --> 00:55:11.080
as an anti-police
brutality group.

00:55:11.080 --> 00:55:13.190
People Against Racism was
founded by Frank Joyce,

00:55:13.190 --> 00:55:16.040
and was an anti-racist,
anti-war-in-Vietnam group.

00:55:16.040 --> 00:55:18.140
The League of
Revolutionary Black Workers

00:55:18.140 --> 00:55:20.120
was our Black Panther Party.

00:55:20.120 --> 00:55:23.940
It originally began as the Dodge
Revolutionary Union Movement,

00:55:23.940 --> 00:55:26.510
which sought to get supervisory
positions and better paying

00:55:26.510 --> 00:55:29.080
positions at the Dodge
main plant in Hamtramck,

00:55:29.080 --> 00:55:31.580
but really branched out
into the social sphere

00:55:31.580 --> 00:55:34.370
with youth groups,
and career training,

00:55:34.370 --> 00:55:38.790
and other positive
community benefits.

00:55:38.790 --> 00:55:44.210
One of those programs that
came out from unification

00:55:44.210 --> 00:55:45.980
called the Motor
City Labor League,

00:55:45.980 --> 00:55:48.440
was the Conflict,
Control, Change Book Club.

00:55:48.440 --> 00:55:51.650
It was a group that
sought to socialize

00:55:51.650 --> 00:55:54.500
white progressives to the
black radical perspective.

00:55:54.500 --> 00:55:57.040
Basically, you want to know
why we're mad, read this book

00:55:57.040 --> 00:55:58.190
and we'll talk about it.

00:55:58.190 --> 00:56:00.020
They constantly had to find
new spaces because they

00:56:00.020 --> 00:56:02.460
kept growing and growing and
growing, and at their peak,

00:56:02.460 --> 00:56:06.290
they had about 350
members, active members.

00:56:06.290 --> 00:56:11.600
The City-Wide Citizen's
Action Committee,

00:56:11.600 --> 00:56:13.532
and the Inner-City
Business Improvement Forum

00:56:13.532 --> 00:56:14.990
were other black
nationalist groups

00:56:14.990 --> 00:56:17.115
that really sought to
rebuild the black community's

00:56:17.115 --> 00:56:20.800
economy through co-ops and
other economic initiatives.

00:56:20.800 --> 00:56:24.740
They were rather successful
till the recessions in the 1970s

00:56:24.740 --> 00:56:26.430
hurt them pretty badly.

00:56:26.430 --> 00:56:31.190
And fighting all of these
folks at once was Breakthrough.

00:56:31.190 --> 00:56:34.150
Raise your hand if you know
Don Lobsinger, know the name

00:56:34.150 --> 00:56:36.410
Don Lobsinger.

00:56:36.410 --> 00:56:38.040
Don Lobsinger was a
right-wing activist

00:56:38.040 --> 00:56:40.880
who is still very mad today.

00:56:40.880 --> 00:56:43.830
He got his start
in the early 1960s.

00:56:43.830 --> 00:56:47.420
He got a name for himself
for dropping dead rats

00:56:47.420 --> 00:56:49.339
on the Chinese ping-pong
team at [INAUDIBLE],,

00:56:49.339 --> 00:56:50.880
for interrupting
the Soviet Symphony,

00:56:50.880 --> 00:56:54.890
for threatening to hang
seemingly everyone.

00:56:54.890 --> 00:56:59.410
But his big break came in
1968 when, because of him,

00:56:59.410 --> 00:57:00.800
the Grosse Pointe
Chief of Police

00:57:00.800 --> 00:57:03.470
had to sit on Martin Luther
King, Jr.'s, lap on the way

00:57:03.470 --> 00:57:05.640
to the Grosse Pointe
speech, and away

00:57:05.640 --> 00:57:08.090
from the Grosse Pointe speech.

00:57:08.090 --> 00:57:10.730
He was able to sneak
in and denounce King

00:57:10.730 --> 00:57:13.370
as a traitor and a Communist.

00:57:16.020 --> 00:57:20.112
We get asked multiple times,
why are we doing this project?

00:57:20.112 --> 00:57:21.570
Our Project Director
was asked, why

00:57:21.570 --> 00:57:24.430
pick a scab off an old wound?

00:57:24.430 --> 00:57:27.510
He replied with, what makes
you think the scab ever formed?

00:57:27.510 --> 00:57:30.105
There are many people in Detroit
who still talk about '67,

00:57:30.105 --> 00:57:32.330
and that is because
'67 continues

00:57:32.330 --> 00:57:33.690
to affect our daily lives.

00:57:33.690 --> 00:57:35.790
And affects city
civil relations.

00:57:35.790 --> 00:57:37.927
It affects race relations.

00:57:37.927 --> 00:57:39.760
And as long as we
continue to talk about '67

00:57:39.760 --> 00:57:42.000
in our tight little
silos, the conversation's

00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:43.870
going to go nowhere.

00:57:43.870 --> 00:57:45.647
So hopefully,
through this project,

00:57:45.647 --> 00:57:47.730
we're going to be breaking
down those silos, which

00:57:47.730 --> 00:57:52.680
allows us to have greater
conversations and more

00:57:52.680 --> 00:57:55.350
meaningful conversations.

00:57:55.350 --> 00:58:01.500
To do this, we put together
the Detroit '67 Project.

00:58:01.500 --> 00:58:04.980
The first initiative we did was
launch the Detroit 1967 Oral

00:58:04.980 --> 00:58:07.530
History Project, which
to date has collected

00:58:07.530 --> 00:58:12.150
over 500 perspectives from '67.

00:58:12.150 --> 00:58:14.910
That has fueled our community
engagement initiative,

00:58:14.910 --> 00:58:17.580
which to date has over
100 formal partners and 50

00:58:17.580 --> 00:58:19.860
informal partners.

00:58:19.860 --> 00:58:23.250
Because we knew we only had
a limited amount of space

00:58:23.250 --> 00:58:25.410
in our exhibit,
we've put together

00:58:25.410 --> 00:58:31.460
the Detroit 1967 companion book,
"Detroit 1967-Origins, Impacts,

00:58:31.460 --> 00:58:36.720
Legacies," which is
really the best Detroit

00:58:36.720 --> 00:58:40.840
historians all in a tight
little book, plus me.

00:58:40.840 --> 00:58:46.480
Danielle McGuire, Kevin Boyle,
Ken Coleman, Tom Sugrue,

00:58:46.480 --> 00:58:50.970
Roy Finkenbine, really
Detroit's premier historians

00:58:50.970 --> 00:58:54.510
dissecting the problems
that led to '67

00:58:54.510 --> 00:58:57.570
and present them in a
compact, and relatable,

00:58:57.570 --> 00:58:59.360
and easy-to-read way.

00:58:59.360 --> 00:59:01.990
Promise that.

00:59:01.990 --> 00:59:05.874
And the final step was unveiling
our exhibit at the Detroit

00:59:05.874 --> 00:59:07.290
Historical Museum,
called "Detroit

00:59:07.290 --> 00:59:11.270
'67-Perspectives," which
focuses on 1917 to the present,

00:59:11.270 --> 00:59:17.470
and really lays out and
fleshes out the story of '67.

00:59:17.470 --> 00:59:19.935
Here's some of our
academic partners.

00:59:19.935 --> 00:59:23.140
Here's some people
who gave us money.

00:59:23.140 --> 00:59:24.780
And these are
different exhibits that

00:59:24.780 --> 00:59:28.760
also went on across the
city during the last year.

00:59:28.760 --> 00:59:31.610
We are the only one
that is still up.

00:59:31.610 --> 00:59:35.730
But this shows the commitment
that the cultural community

00:59:35.730 --> 00:59:38.880
put forth in
understanding, dissecting,

00:59:38.880 --> 00:59:41.432
and talking about '67.

00:59:41.432 --> 00:59:43.420
And thank you so much Google.

00:59:43.420 --> 00:59:44.320
It was great.

00:59:44.320 --> 00:59:45.950
I probably said,
"Uh," like, a lot.

00:59:45.950 --> 00:59:47.460
But other than
that, it was great.

00:59:47.460 --> 00:59:51.110
[APPLAUSE]
