00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.230
SPEAKER: As you know, our guest
is former SEAL Rob O'Neill.

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.650
Give you a little bit
of background about Rob.

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.270
Rob has more than
a dozen deployments

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:18.206
with over 400 combat missions.

00:00:18.206 --> 00:00:20.580
He was decorated with two
silver stars, four bronze stars

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.370
with valor, a Joint
Service Commendation Medal,

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:26.550
three Presidential Unit
citations, and two Navy

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.050
commendations with valor.

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.410
So today, Rob is going to come
up and join us, talk about what

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.930
it takes to be successful in
high-paced, high-performance

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:34.440
teams.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.490
And he's going to
be drawing on some

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:37.230
of his experiences
as a SEAL and some

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.620
of the stories in the book.

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:39.120
OK, cool.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.679
So let's make Rob feel welcome.

00:00:40.679 --> 00:00:43.553
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:46.430
ROB O'NEILL: Thank you.

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:47.179
All right, buddy.

00:00:47.179 --> 00:00:48.179
SPEAKER: Thank you, sir.

00:00:48.179 --> 00:00:50.027
ROB O'NEILL: Thanks.

00:00:50.027 --> 00:00:50.860
Thank you very much.

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:52.890
I appreciate it.

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.550
SPEAKER: So first off,
thanks for coming today, Rob.

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:56.550
ROB O'NEILL: Absolutely.

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.790
SPEAKER: The book, it's not
just a story about the bin Laden

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:00.290
raid, right?

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:02.419
It's a story about a
kid from Butte, Montana,

00:01:02.419 --> 00:01:03.710
and his journey with the SEALs.

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:05.155
Can you tell us
how it all started?

00:01:05.155 --> 00:01:05.905
ROB O'NEILL: Yeah.

00:01:05.905 --> 00:01:07.330
The book itself is--

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.330
I was part of the mission
to go after Osama bin Laden,

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:16.430
but it came after a long career
and a lot of stuff we did.

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.800
I joined the Navy by accident.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.550
Like, it was because of a girl.

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:25.550
I had to get away from
her in Butte, Montana.

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:27.120
Because you know,
I was 19 years old,

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:28.950
I knew everything about life.

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.280
I had my heart broken
like we've all done,

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.130
and I figured I'd
join the Marine Corps.

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:34.760
And I tried to join
the Marine Corps,

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.804
but the Marine recruiter
wasn't in the office.

00:01:36.804 --> 00:01:38.970
That's the easiest way to
get out of Butte, Montana,

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.409
is to join the military.

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.450
We've just got pavement
and power lines and stuff

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:43.610
up there--

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:44.490
kidding.

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.700
But I went to join
the Marine Corps.

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.450
He wasn't in the office,
and two of my friends

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.729
that were about two or
three years older than me

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:54.020
named Ben and Jim were Marines.

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.410
And they said the Marine
Corps is actually part

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:57.660
of the Department of the Navy.

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:59.150
It's just the men's department.

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:00.620
It was one of their jokes.

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:02.810
So I went in the
Navy guy because he

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.090
would know where the Marine
was, all by accident,

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.430
and he actually talked
me into being a Navy SEAL

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:09.013
even though I didn't
know how to swim.

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:13.530
I remember standing in front
of him thinking, you know,

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:14.670
I'm 19 years old.

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:15.459
I'm kind of naive.

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:17.000
This guy is a
professional recruiter.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.740
Why is he going to lie to me?

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:19.890
So we signed it.

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.170
I found out SEALs do swim.

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:22.420
I found out I was in a pickle.

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.124
But the point of
the whole book is

00:02:24.124 --> 00:02:26.540
I ended up being that naive
kid that had his heart broken,

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.370
joined the military,
became a SEAL,

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:29.767
learned how to
swim the hard way.

00:02:29.767 --> 00:02:31.350
I was involved with
a lot of missions.

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.729
17 years later, I'm in
bin Laden's bedroom,

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:36.020
part of one of the greatest
teams the military has ever

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.710
assembled.

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:40.069
The whole point of the book
is doesn't matter what you

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:41.360
look like or where you're from.

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.386
You can do anything you want.

00:02:43.386 --> 00:02:44.510
You just need to work hard.

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.940
You need to believe in
yourself and certainly avoid

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:47.960
the negativity.

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.270
Negativity breeds and has
a tendency to spoil things.

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:54.730
If you can stay positive
and be good to each other,

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:55.563
you can do anything.

00:02:55.563 --> 00:02:58.260
That's the whole
premise of the book.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:58.760
Cool.

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:59.962
Appreciate that, thanks.

00:02:59.962 --> 00:03:00.826
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:00.826 --> 00:03:01.690
Awesome.

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.064
And I was going to say, if
you haven't read the book yet,

00:03:04.064 --> 00:03:05.090
there's a spoiler alert.

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.020
Bin Laden does die
at the end of it.

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.700
SPEAKER: OK.

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.250
So as you start SEAL training,
one of the major hurdles

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:13.072
is BUD/S, right?

00:03:13.072 --> 00:03:13.780
ROB O'NEILL: Yep.

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.320
SPEAKER: So any TV
show or book I've read,

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.650
it's just a hugely
demanding kind of a way

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.390
to weed out some of
the candidates early

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.500
in the SEAL process, and the
mental fortitude it takes

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:27.920
is just so impressive.

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.310
So can you give the audience
an idea of how intense

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.434
that process is and what
your mental strategy is

00:03:32.434 --> 00:03:33.100
to survive that?

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:33.850
ROB O'NEILL: Yeah.

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:37.380
BUD/S is the course that every
Navy SEAL needs to go through,

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.850
and it stands for Basic
Underwater Demolition SEAL

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:41.450
training.

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:44.710
And it's the one that you
see on a lot of the TV shows,

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:47.560
and it's in a lot of books.

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.240
It's the hardest
military training

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:53.060
in the world from the
first day to the end.

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:55.780
Now, there's about three or four
months prior to the first day

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.289
if that makes any sense.

00:03:57.289 --> 00:03:58.705
But once you start,
it's 26 weeks.

00:04:02.737 --> 00:04:04.570
The beginning of it,
the first 9 to 10 weeks

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:06.070
is all calisthenics.

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:09.099
So it's like, the
workout starts at 5:00

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:11.140
AM, which means you've
got up at 4:00 or whatever

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:13.720
and class gets together,
gets a full headcount.

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.694
The workout starts at or 5:00.

00:04:15.694 --> 00:04:17.485
You work until about
6:30, go to breakfast.

00:04:17.485 --> 00:04:19.209
Then you come
back, and you'll do

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:21.925
like two hours of
log workouts, which

00:04:21.925 --> 00:04:23.800
means you've got a
couple-hundred-pound logs,

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.600
where you're working
out with six guys each

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.289
holding a log doing
different drills,

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:29.080
through negative
reinforcement teaching you

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:33.662
that if one guy doesn't pull his
weight then the team will fail.

00:04:33.662 --> 00:04:35.620
And then you'll rest and
change into something.

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:38.740
You have a seven-mile
conditioning run

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:41.350
in the soft sand, followed
by a two-mile timed swim

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:42.016
in the ocean.

00:04:42.016 --> 00:04:43.390
Then you'd run to
the pool, which

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:46.000
is a mile and a half away, swim
there, get tied up, thrown in,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.500
do different drills.

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.590
You do this all day
long every single day.

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:52.900
And something funny, too,
that no one seems to realize

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:55.690
is, from where you do these
workouts to the galley--

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:57.770
which is where you eat--

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:58.959
it's a mile away.

00:04:58.959 --> 00:05:01.000
So no matter what, you're
running six miles a day

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.185
just to eat.

00:05:03.185 --> 00:05:04.060
I love this building.

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:06.070
Food is 300 feet
away at all times.

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:07.590
That's not a bad gig.

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:09.760
But yeah, it's a tough course.

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.610
One of the hardest parts
is called Hell Week, which

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:15.910
is where they wake you up for
training on Sunday late morning

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:18.430
and then you do that kind
of training around the clock

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:19.990
every day until Friday.

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:21.610
So you don't sleep.

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:22.420
It's miserable.

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:25.660
It's so bad they keep you
covered in salt water and sand

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:27.790
the entire time.

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:30.542
By Wednesday morning,
your skin is so soft

00:05:30.542 --> 00:05:32.500
that every part of your
body that touches cloth

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:34.360
starts to bleed.

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:36.280
And you're wearing
clothes, so you just

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:37.510
become a bloody, sloppy mess.

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:39.626
It's a horrible time.

00:05:39.626 --> 00:05:41.500
Right now, I think it's
85% of the people who

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:43.060
try out do not make it through.

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:43.630
SPEAKER: Wow.

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:45.900
ROB O'NEILL: And that's
the initial testing

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:46.900
to try to become a SEAL.

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:50.260
After that, it's another year
until you get your Trident

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.580
and become a SEAL-- more
advanced tactics, small unit

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:57.190
stuff, tendencies of
other people and all that.

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:58.880
But it's a tough course.

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:01.930
SPEAKER: So once you finished
your training, after BUD/S,

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:03.511
you make it onto the SEAL team.

00:06:03.511 --> 00:06:05.760
That brought you to a couple
of different deployments,

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:07.960
and one of those
was Afghanistan.

00:06:10.565 --> 00:06:12.370
ROB O'NEILL: I got
there pre 9/11,

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:14.920
so my first four
deployments were actually

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:17.950
to a lot of Europe,
a lot of Africa,

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:19.936
some of the Middle East.

00:06:19.936 --> 00:06:21.310
The only jobs we
really had going

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:24.820
on as far special operators were
like Kosovo, Bosnia, Liberia.

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:27.580
There was a few things we had
to go help with the embassies.

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:30.019
Generally, they were training--

00:06:30.019 --> 00:06:31.810
training with Allied
Special Forces in case

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:33.851
of contingencies, like
the stuff that we actually

00:06:33.851 --> 00:06:36.010
saw after 9/11, the stuff
in North Korea right now,

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:38.200
training with our allies.

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:40.630
Because we were SEALs,
we worked with people

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:45.347
called the Special Boat Service,
the SBS, the Brits in the UK.

00:06:45.347 --> 00:06:47.680
We'd work with some of our
Northern Africa allies a lot,

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:51.370
some of our United Arab
Emirates, Norwegian Jaegers,

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:53.720
things like that.

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:55.570
I didn't go to Afghanistan
until after 9/11.

00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:55.840
SPEAKER: OK.

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:56.339
Got ya.

00:06:56.339 --> 00:06:58.000
So when you did
get to Afghanistan,

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.090
though, in the book it seemed
like it was a new environment

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:01.960
for a lot of people.

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:04.060
It was a little ambiguous.

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:06.400
Can you talk us
through how you were

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:10.570
able to make decision-making
processes and strategy

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:12.700
decisions in an ambiguous
environment like that?

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:12.880
ROB O'NEILL: Yeah.

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:13.640
It was, too.

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:18.070
We'd never really been to war
as a nation since Vietnam,

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:19.790
and we'd never been
in a war like this,

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:23.380
a certain counterinsurgency-type
operation like in Afghanistan.

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:25.270
And when we first
started going there,

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:27.610
we realized that the way
you're going to win that-- not

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:30.970
win that, but make it more
stable, I guess-- would be you

00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:33.037
need the locals to
be on your team.

00:07:33.037 --> 00:07:34.120
You need them to like you.

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:35.828
And a lot of people
say hearts and minds.

00:07:35.828 --> 00:07:37.710
I think that gets overused.

00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:39.830
More minds than anything.

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:41.360
We were trying to be innovative.

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:44.890
And we realized that if we
can make their lives better,

00:07:44.890 --> 00:07:46.280
we can get them on our team.

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:48.330
And how do you make
someone's life better?

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:49.030
Family first.

00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:50.570
You want to help them
support their family.

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:51.430
So you've got to give him a job.

00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:52.831
So we would find
a spot with some

00:07:52.831 --> 00:07:54.330
of the money we
were given, and we'd

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:55.844
get what's called a safe house.

00:07:55.844 --> 00:07:57.760
So you'd buy a building,
make it a safe house,

00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:01.000
then you hire first
security-- so you actually

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.420
have interviews with locals
that know how to use guns.

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:06.580
So they are your security,
once you vet them.

00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:08.410
You hire plumbers,
make your place better.

00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:10.680
You're hiring cooks,
hiring all kinds of stuff--

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:11.180
drivers.

00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:14.967
And then we actually expanded
it to going out in the towns,

00:08:14.967 --> 00:08:17.050
shopping in the bazaars,
eating at the restaurants

00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:20.890
in Afghanistan, getting
to know the neighbors

00:08:20.890 --> 00:08:25.411
and their children so that if
a parent sees you getting along

00:08:25.411 --> 00:08:27.910
with their, kids they're going
to try to protect you as best

00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:29.170
they can from people
like the Taliban,

00:08:29.170 --> 00:08:30.610
like al-Qaeda, through anything.

00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:32.409
Because it's not just
bombs and bullets,

00:08:32.409 --> 00:08:35.019
it's human intelligence.

00:08:35.019 --> 00:08:38.633
People that go to the internet
cafes and the coffee shops,

00:08:38.633 --> 00:08:40.299
they're hearing stuff
from other people.

00:08:40.299 --> 00:08:42.604
They're talking to
their cousins who

00:08:42.604 --> 00:08:44.520
hear from the Taliban,
intel chains like that.

00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:45.770
So it was working for a while.

00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:47.530
We-- I felt like we
had it won over there

00:08:47.530 --> 00:08:50.050
for a long, long time.

00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:54.462
The issue is a lot of
government agencies,

00:08:54.462 --> 00:08:55.420
they're not innovative.

00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:58.060
And they love to say this is
the way we've always done it.

00:08:58.060 --> 00:08:59.240
And they do what's
called a surge.

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:00.948
I'm sure if people
have heard about that.

00:09:00.948 --> 00:09:02.500
It kind of worked in Iraq.

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:06.260
It worked in Europe
in World War II.

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:07.510
It didn't work in Afghanistan.

00:09:07.510 --> 00:09:10.060
And just, I remember
seeing the process of that,

00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:12.110
how it's not going to work.

00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:15.000
Didn't even explain it to the
bosses before it happened.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.600
We have the safe houses.

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:17.720
The locals like us.

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:19.360
We're shopping in the bazaars.

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:24.100
And they decided-- this is like
big military, big government.

00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:25.895
Well, let's get a base
here, build walls,

00:09:25.895 --> 00:09:27.520
and we'll pull everyone
out of the city

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:28.960
and you can live there.

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:31.321
And then the only
people driving outside

00:09:31.321 --> 00:09:33.820
will be the scared 20-year-old
guy that's never been to war,

00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:35.589
so he's driving fast
and hitting people.

00:09:35.589 --> 00:09:37.630
And if you want to shop,
we'll bring five vendors

00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:40.870
into the base and
then they can sell,

00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:43.279
but now they upped
their prices by 800%.

00:09:43.279 --> 00:09:44.320
These people get nothing.

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:45.340
They see that happening.

00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:45.940
They're upset.

00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:48.070
They're rich.

00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:49.720
You sort of see
what's happening.

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:51.761
You're going to become
what's known as occupiers,

00:09:51.761 --> 00:09:54.326
and that's how you get
in a quagmire 2017.

00:09:54.326 --> 00:09:56.200
So it was interesting
to see both sides of it

00:09:56.200 --> 00:10:01.090
and actually kind of a
business-like team building

00:10:01.090 --> 00:10:05.130
and almost local leadership,
just in a military aspect.

00:10:05.130 --> 00:10:08.800
That's kind of where
we learned that.

00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:09.790
SPEAKER: Cool.

00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:12.220
ROB O'NEILL: That was
a long answer, sorry.

00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:14.530
SPEAKER: So by late
2000s you made it

00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:16.320
to senior chief
petty officer, right?

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:17.320
ROB O'NEILL: Mm hmm.

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:20.740
SPEAKER: Can you tell us what
skills and leadership traits

00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:23.200
you feel like developed the
most from when you first

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:25.990
got to the SEAL teams against
when you were a senior chief?

00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:26.740
ROB O'NEILL: Yeah.

00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:29.650
What developed the most--

00:10:29.650 --> 00:10:31.864
experience doesn't necessarily
come from a classroom.

00:10:31.864 --> 00:10:33.280
It comes from on
the job training,

00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:36.910
and it comes from watching both
your peers and your superiors,

00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:38.200
how they're going to act.

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:40.420
And one thing that I noticed--

00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:41.800
I was on a lot of
different teams

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:43.570
at a lot of different
times, and the teams

00:10:43.570 --> 00:10:46.630
that performed at
the highest levels

00:10:46.630 --> 00:10:50.226
were teams that communicated,
but got along with each other.

00:10:50.226 --> 00:10:51.850
And I remember watching
bosses of mine.

00:10:51.850 --> 00:10:53.260
They were so senior
to me they didn't even

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.930
need to acknowledge me, but they
would say good morning, please,

00:10:55.930 --> 00:10:58.360
and thank you for normal work.

00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:01.254
Not all the time, but when it
was legitimate compliments just

00:11:01.254 --> 00:11:03.170
to make you feel like
you're part of the team.

00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:05.670
And we noticed, when people
want to be where they're working

00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:08.380
and truly respect each other
that the team works harder.

00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:10.210
So what we learned about it--

00:11:10.210 --> 00:11:12.250
one of my tactics
was I would, even

00:11:12.250 --> 00:11:14.980
if I had a decision made
as one of the team leaders,

00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:18.560
I would always ask my people
for their input for two reasons.

00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:22.640
One, they would maybe have
a better idea than I did.

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:24.870
But they also felt like
they're part of the solution.

00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:26.370
So morale is high,
and people skills

00:11:26.370 --> 00:11:29.192
is one of the major reason we
were a very successful team.

00:11:29.192 --> 00:11:31.150
SPEAKER: I think a tricky
thing to do sometimes

00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:34.522
is balance overplanning
with micromanagement.

00:11:34.522 --> 00:11:35.230
ROB O'NEILL: Yes.

00:11:35.230 --> 00:11:37.780
SPEAKER: The bin Laden raid,
from what I read in the book,

00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:40.040
it seemed like every
contingency plan

00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:41.452
and every detail
was planned out.

00:11:41.452 --> 00:11:42.160
ROB O'NEILL: Yes.

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:45.160
SPEAKER: How do you balance
planning a mission out

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:48.627
with that much detail and not
micromanaging your people?

00:11:48.627 --> 00:11:50.710
ROB O'NEILL: The first
part is, with the planning,

00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:53.170
the realization that the
only time the plan exists

00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:54.700
is while you're planning.

00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:57.529
And then once you go to do it,
everything is going to change.

00:11:57.529 --> 00:11:59.320
It's the whole thing,
the only thing that's

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:01.240
wrong is that nothing's wrong.

00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:04.020
And anything that you do can get
you killed including nothing,

00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:05.020
if that makes any sense.

00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:07.394
And then life, by the way, is
what's happening around you

00:12:07.394 --> 00:12:09.850
as you're planning.

00:12:09.850 --> 00:12:12.220
A prime example was
the bin Laden raid.

00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:14.480
We had some of the
best military minds

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:16.630
in the country
coming up with a plan

00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:18.160
because we knew
what it looked like.

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:20.020
So we came up with
the perfect plan,

00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:21.710
and we rehearsed
the perfect plan.

00:12:21.710 --> 00:12:24.250
Over and over, we trained with
the helicopters in the day,

00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:26.290
and then eat something,
then train at night.

00:12:26.290 --> 00:12:29.600
And when we were done at 11:30,
midnight, or whatever, go back

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:31.300
and we stand around a table--

00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:33.790
perfect model of the thing--
and talk about the perfect

00:12:33.790 --> 00:12:35.615
plan till we're talking
about everything.

00:12:35.615 --> 00:12:37.240
Then we came up with
the contingencies,

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:39.220
tried to what if everything.

00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:41.200
But we know the perfect
plan is going to work.

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:43.060
And then one night we're
standing around very tired,

00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:45.700
and the boss said OK, what's the
worst thing that could happen?

00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:47.890
And the youngest guy
in the room said, well,

00:12:47.890 --> 00:12:50.350
the helicopter could
crash in the front yard.

00:12:50.350 --> 00:12:51.550
And he pointed right
there, and everyone kind of

00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:53.466
looked at him like, you
don't want to jinx it.

00:12:53.466 --> 00:12:54.512
Hey, negative.

00:12:54.512 --> 00:12:55.470
Why would you say that?

00:12:55.470 --> 00:12:57.670
And he goes, I don't know, let's
talk about that for 30 seconds.

00:12:57.670 --> 00:12:58.360
And we did.

00:12:58.360 --> 00:12:59.450
And that's exactly
what happened.

00:12:59.450 --> 00:13:01.033
The helicopter
crashed, and none of us

00:13:01.033 --> 00:13:03.369
knew it except the
guys that crashed.

00:13:03.369 --> 00:13:04.160
But we didn't know.

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:05.590
We were in the other one.

00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:07.990
But yeah, the
micromanagement process--

00:13:07.990 --> 00:13:11.087
I always ask people, are
you teaching your people

00:13:11.087 --> 00:13:12.670
how to do their jobs
or are you trying

00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:14.840
to do their job for them?

00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:17.860
We were big believers in making
sure our guys are prepared,

00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:20.620
teaching them exactly what we
think they need to do, and then

00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:21.190
let it eat.

00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:24.860
Let them do what they should do.

00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:26.050
The whole rule of threes.

00:13:26.050 --> 00:13:29.470
We thought that you can do
three major tasks at once.

00:13:29.470 --> 00:13:33.730
If you get to four and
five, you'll lose something.

00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:34.610
You get complacent.

00:13:34.610 --> 00:13:36.610
So you need to hand those
tasks to someone else

00:13:36.610 --> 00:13:38.010
knowing that they'll
get to three or four

00:13:38.010 --> 00:13:40.120
and then hand the fourth one
to another part of the team.

00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:42.400
And just the micromanagement
slows everything down,

00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:43.858
and then there's
overcommunication,

00:13:43.858 --> 00:13:46.000
which is the opposite of
effective communication.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.080
That's kind of the
way we tried to roll.

00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:47.746
SPEAKER: Got ya.

00:13:47.746 --> 00:13:49.750
So leading into the raid--

00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:51.400
so night of, you're
on the helicopter.

00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:54.180
Can you tell us what some
of your thoughts were?

00:13:54.180 --> 00:13:56.490
I imagine it had to
be very stressful.

00:13:56.490 --> 00:13:59.320
It's maybe the most important
mission you've been on.

00:13:59.320 --> 00:13:59.760
ROB O'NEILL: Yeah, it was.

00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:00.980
SPEAKER: In your
career at that point.

00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:01.600
ROB O'NEILL: It was.

00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:03.590
SPEAKER: Take us through
your mindset there.

00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:04.480
How did you manage the stress.

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:07.000
ROB O'NEILL: This team that
I was on, we were fortunate,

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.780
right place at the right time.

00:14:08.780 --> 00:14:10.570
We were part of
the coalition that

00:14:10.570 --> 00:14:12.552
rescue the lone survivor,
Marcus Luttrell.

00:14:12.552 --> 00:14:14.260
They made a book and
a movie out of that.

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:16.750
We were in Ramadi when
"American Sniper,"

00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:18.250
that story with Chris Kyle.

00:14:18.250 --> 00:14:21.369
We rescued Captain Richard
Phillips from Somali pirates,

00:14:21.369 --> 00:14:23.410
and then we were picked
to do the bin Laden raid.

00:14:23.410 --> 00:14:24.940
So we'd been there
quite a few times.

00:14:24.940 --> 00:14:27.023
We fought in a bunch of
different theaters of war.

00:14:27.023 --> 00:14:29.500
But when they picked us
for the bin Laden raid,

00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:32.700
that was the one where we
weren't going to come home.

00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:34.800
We knew that we were
going to die or get

00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:36.990
captured, which in
that part of the world

00:14:36.990 --> 00:14:38.670
is probably worse than dying.

00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:44.160
So we went into it
with the expectation

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:48.067
that the probability of
dying, very, very high.

00:14:48.067 --> 00:14:50.400
To the point where we were
actually having conversations

00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:52.316
about, OK, we've got to
think about how are we

00:14:52.316 --> 00:14:54.720
getting focused for this.

00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:56.250
I think I was like 35 years old.

00:14:56.250 --> 00:14:58.177
And I was like,
well, if I don't go

00:14:58.177 --> 00:15:00.260
on this, what if when I'm
70, I look back and just

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:02.812
have nothing but regret because
I didn't go on that mission.

00:15:02.812 --> 00:15:04.020
I need to go on this mission.

00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:06.020
I need to accept the fact
we're not coming home.

00:15:09.076 --> 00:15:10.950
When we were going up
the last set of stairs,

00:15:10.950 --> 00:15:12.780
the guy who ended up
being in front of me--

00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:14.696
the first guy up the
stairs and I was second--

00:15:17.014 --> 00:15:19.680
he said, don't get me wrong, I'm
going-- because it's all going,

00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:20.888
this is the thought process--

00:15:20.888 --> 00:15:21.810
I'm really going.

00:15:21.810 --> 00:15:26.050
But if we know we're going
to die, why are we going?

00:15:26.050 --> 00:15:27.460
Which is legit.

00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:29.922
I'd want a wargame
that one, too.

00:15:29.922 --> 00:15:31.630
But then the conversation
we came up with

00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:33.338
was, well, we're not
going for ourselves.

00:15:33.338 --> 00:15:35.380
We're not going for
bravado or fame.

00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:38.810
We're going for the single
mom who dropped her kids off

00:15:38.810 --> 00:15:41.370
at elementary school
on a Tuesday morning

00:15:41.370 --> 00:15:43.370
and 45 minutes later she
jumped to her death out

00:15:43.370 --> 00:15:45.078
of a skyscraper because
that was a better

00:15:45.078 --> 00:15:46.880
alternative than burning alive.

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:48.470
And her last gesture
of human decency

00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:50.719
was holding her skirt down
so no one saw her underwear

00:15:50.719 --> 00:15:52.220
as she killed herself.

00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:53.595
She didn't want
to do either one,

00:15:53.595 --> 00:15:55.386
and she wasn't supposed
to be in the fight.

00:15:55.386 --> 00:15:56.000
We are.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.860
And that's the kind of
conversations we're having.

00:15:57.860 --> 00:15:58.901
That's where we're going.

00:15:58.901 --> 00:16:04.546
So when we left, I remember
it wasn't a stress,

00:16:04.546 --> 00:16:05.420
and it wasn't a fear.

00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:06.519
It was a focus.

00:16:06.519 --> 00:16:08.060
You have the last
meal with your kids

00:16:08.060 --> 00:16:10.750
even though you can't
tell them you're leaving.

00:16:10.750 --> 00:16:12.500
This is probably the
last time I see them,

00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:14.330
watching them eat a chicken
sandwich as they go play

00:16:14.330 --> 00:16:16.700
in the playpen, but you're
thinking about leaving

00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:18.570
for Pakistan in two hours.

00:16:18.570 --> 00:16:22.130
So very, very focused, very
good group of people that went.

00:16:22.130 --> 00:16:24.860
SPEAKER: So after
the mission, the team

00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:26.390
got a visit from
President Obama--

00:16:26.390 --> 00:16:26.570
ROB O'NEILL: We did.

00:16:26.570 --> 00:16:27.240
SPEAKER: And Vice
President Biden.

00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:27.640
Right?

00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:27.890
ROB O'NEILL: Yes.

00:16:27.890 --> 00:16:28.931
SPEAKER: How did that go?

00:16:28.931 --> 00:16:33.600
ROB O'NEILL: That was like a 180
out from how we felt going in

00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:36.440
because you've got to figure,
everyone from the government

00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:39.260
agencies up to the White House,
especially, President Obama

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:40.970
had to think--

00:16:40.970 --> 00:16:44.060
he made the call, I don't
care about who argues on TV.

00:16:44.060 --> 00:16:44.960
He made the call.

00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:48.440
And he did that knowing
that, if we fail,

00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:51.080
I mean, obviously, he's
losing some of his soldiers,

00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:52.460
but he's also losing his legacy.

00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:53.960
He's not going to
win a second term.

00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:55.668
There's a thing called
Desert One in 1980

00:16:55.668 --> 00:16:57.770
when we tried to rescue
hostages in Iran,

00:16:57.770 --> 00:17:01.700
complete failure, horrible
for that administration.

00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:03.920
And he knew he was rolling--
not rolling the dice.

00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:07.010
He was very cool because he
said, when I made the decision,

00:17:07.010 --> 00:17:10.040
I didn't know for 100% that
Osama bin Laden was there,

00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:13.050
but I knew 100% you guys could
go and find out and come back.

00:17:13.050 --> 00:17:15.569
So he had that on his mind, and
that's a lot to think about,

00:17:15.569 --> 00:17:17.027
along with all the
other stuff that

00:17:17.027 --> 00:17:18.349
comes with being the president.

00:17:18.349 --> 00:17:20.849
And then we were thinking about
death and this and whatever.

00:17:20.849 --> 00:17:23.569
And then we all got back,
and we're all alive.

00:17:23.569 --> 00:17:24.574
So now, we're all happy.

00:17:24.574 --> 00:17:26.240
So when we met the
president, I remember

00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:27.260
sitting there
thinking, man, I wonder

00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:29.930
if I'm going to get starstruck,
and I hear, hey everybody.

00:17:29.930 --> 00:17:31.310
It's President Obama.

00:17:31.310 --> 00:17:32.390
Yeah, so I'm starstruck.

00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:34.490
That's kind of--

00:17:34.490 --> 00:17:35.600
But it was neat, too.

00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:38.144
We had an issue
when we brought--

00:17:38.144 --> 00:17:39.560
how I mentioned
that you think you

00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:41.060
can be prepared for
everything, but you're not.

00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:43.340
When we brought Osama
bin Laden's body back,

00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:45.810
we were on the phone
with the White House.

00:17:45.810 --> 00:17:47.410
We're trying to
make sure it's him.

00:17:47.410 --> 00:17:48.618
So they're like, measure him.

00:17:48.618 --> 00:17:50.390
He's 6' 4", and we're like OK.

00:17:50.390 --> 00:17:52.390
We had to lay down one
of our snipers who was 6'

00:17:52.390 --> 00:17:54.392
2" next to him.

00:17:54.392 --> 00:17:55.850
So when we got to
this place we met

00:17:55.850 --> 00:17:57.725
President Obama like a
week and a half later,

00:17:57.725 --> 00:17:59.520
he says, let me
get this straight.

00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:03.020
You can destroy one of my
$200 million helicopters,

00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:06.670
but you cannot afford
a $0.99 tape measure.

00:18:06.670 --> 00:18:07.560
So it was very light.

00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:08.351
Everyone was happy.

00:18:08.351 --> 00:18:09.830
And it was like,
for a whole week,

00:18:09.830 --> 00:18:11.990
I thought we might
as a country finally

00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:13.550
agree on a bunch of stuff.

00:18:13.550 --> 00:18:14.570
So I was wrong.

00:18:14.570 --> 00:18:17.112
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:17.112 --> 00:18:18.570
SPEAKER: You guys,
I like the story

00:18:18.570 --> 00:18:20.030
you presented him with a gift.

00:18:20.030 --> 00:18:21.860
Did he have some
words about that?

00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:22.610
ROB O'NEILL: Yeah.

00:18:22.610 --> 00:18:23.780
That was really cool.

00:18:23.780 --> 00:18:24.740
He came there.

00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:26.720
Obviously, we wanted
everyone to get along

00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:29.090
and have everyone in a
room and have a great talk.

00:18:29.090 --> 00:18:31.820
And he came to present us
with a Presidential Unit

00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:34.722
Citation, which is a gift the
president obviously gives you.

00:18:34.722 --> 00:18:36.680
And what we did for him,
though he didn't know,

00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:41.740
was one of our guys carried
a full-size American flag

00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:42.550
on the mission.

00:18:42.550 --> 00:18:44.500
And as soon as we got
back, we had it framed.

00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:49.300
And everyone-- the
operators, the pilots,

00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:52.450
the air crew-- we all signed
the back of it for him.

00:18:52.450 --> 00:18:56.050
And I hope no one is offended
because this story is

00:18:56.050 --> 00:18:58.572
better with profanity, but
we presented it to him.

00:18:58.572 --> 00:18:59.530
And he's looking at it.

00:18:59.530 --> 00:19:00.882
And I could see--

00:19:00.882 --> 00:19:03.340
the president sees a lot of
stuff and knows a lot of stuff,

00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:04.715
but he kind of
got shell shocked.

00:19:04.715 --> 00:19:06.190
And he goes, wow.

00:19:06.190 --> 00:19:07.040
Mr. Vice President.

00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:10.120
Do you think I can find
a nice spot to hang that?

00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:11.667
And Vice President
Biden said, yeah,

00:19:11.667 --> 00:19:13.625
that'll look nice in your
presidential library.

00:19:13.625 --> 00:19:15.750
And he goes, nah, it's
going in my fucking bedroom.

00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:19.010
[LAUGHTER] Which kind
of humanizes him.

00:19:19.010 --> 00:19:21.820
It's pretty awesome.

00:19:21.820 --> 00:19:24.070
SPEAKER: So you started
touching it on a little bit.

00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:26.860
You said the pilots, the intel
people, the SEALs themselves

00:19:26.860 --> 00:19:27.820
on the mission.

00:19:27.820 --> 00:19:30.580
A lot of times we credit
the success of this mission

00:19:30.580 --> 00:19:31.674
to the SEALs themselves.

00:19:31.674 --> 00:19:33.340
But can you give us
an idea of the scope

00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:36.160
and how many teams were involved

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:37.410
ROB O'NEILL: I wouldn't even--

00:19:37.410 --> 00:19:41.400
I mean, as SEALs we did go in
there, but we were the endgame.

00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:45.360
We were the final result of
years of a team planning this.

00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:47.970
It starts off with, like I
said, the human intelligence

00:19:47.970 --> 00:19:49.500
on the ground that led to--

00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:51.420
there's a movie called
"Zero Dark Thirty"

00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:53.070
about a woman that
found bin Laden,

00:19:53.070 --> 00:19:55.687
and it was pretty much true.

00:19:55.687 --> 00:19:58.270
The only difference is it was a
group of women that found him,

00:19:58.270 --> 00:19:59.311
which I think is awesome.

00:19:59.311 --> 00:20:02.100
And they worked their butts off
to make sure they tracked him

00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:03.159
to this one house.

00:20:03.159 --> 00:20:04.950
And so this government
agency worked on him

00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:08.070
for years and years and
years, pinpointing him.

00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:09.780
It was to the point
where, the one woman

00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:11.220
that the movie's about,
when we got done,

00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:13.410
she was 100% right about
every person in the house

00:20:13.410 --> 00:20:15.450
and where they'd be,
which is just incredible

00:20:15.450 --> 00:20:17.283
considering she can't
even see in the house.

00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:23.970
So there's your base team
that comes up with the ideas,

00:20:23.970 --> 00:20:25.610
and then you've got your
people that are selling it.

00:20:25.610 --> 00:20:26.730
So they've got to
sell it to government

00:20:26.730 --> 00:20:28.020
agencies and the White House.

00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:29.770
So they're working
that, different things,

00:20:29.770 --> 00:20:33.749
up to even the head of
the CIA, Director Panetta.

00:20:33.749 --> 00:20:34.290
He was there.

00:20:34.290 --> 00:20:35.040
They had to sell him.

00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:36.030
He has to sell the White House.

00:20:36.030 --> 00:20:36.520
All that works.

00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:38.895
Then the White House needs to
go through their delegation

00:20:38.895 --> 00:20:42.300
process to include the National
Security Council, the Cabinet,

00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:43.000
the principals.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.260
They need to talk and then
come up with a why or why not.

00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:47.760
They need to wargame that, tell
the president it's his call.

00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:49.270
And then, after
all this happens,

00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:50.940
they come and tell
us three weeks out.

00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:51.970
Hey, you're going
to go on a mission.

00:20:51.970 --> 00:20:54.070
And here's what you're
going to do and whatever.

00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:56.356
And then the pilots,
they picked the four best

00:20:56.356 --> 00:20:57.730
pilots in the
world, and they had

00:20:57.730 --> 00:20:59.260
been flying for years and
years, but they had never

00:20:59.260 --> 00:21:01.260
even flown these
helicopters we brought in.

00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:03.622
So it's crediting
these guys who fly.

00:21:03.622 --> 00:21:05.580
I don't think I even
looked out the damn window

00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:07.871
because they're probably 40
feet off the ground flying.

00:21:07.871 --> 00:21:11.670
I'm not a pilot, but I'm pretty
sure they're flying this fast.

00:21:11.670 --> 00:21:12.960
I don't know what that is.

00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:14.844
Gas pedal, that's funny.

00:21:14.844 --> 00:21:16.194
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:16.194 --> 00:21:17.610
And then they just
dropped us off,

00:21:17.610 --> 00:21:18.736
and then we just did what--

00:21:18.736 --> 00:21:20.735
I mean, even considering
the people who invented

00:21:20.735 --> 00:21:21.780
the tactics that we used.

00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:22.650
Because we got on the ground.

00:21:22.650 --> 00:21:23.710
One helicopter crashes.

00:21:23.710 --> 00:21:25.320
They land us here,
and we're just

00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:29.250
rolling off the communication,
the tactics that the myriad--

00:21:29.250 --> 00:21:33.240
SEALs, Green Berets,
Rangers-- came up with.

00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:34.731
The team was so
big, and there's so

00:21:34.731 --> 00:21:37.230
many things that go along with
it that they never really get

00:21:37.230 --> 00:21:38.070
the credit.

00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:39.960
I mean, even with myself, when
I get up to the top stairs

00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:41.376
and turn a corner,
I just did what

00:21:41.376 --> 00:21:42.670
any operator would have done.

00:21:42.670 --> 00:21:44.294
It's not like I jump
through a skylight

00:21:44.294 --> 00:21:46.620
like I'm Charlie Sheen in
that amazing movie "Navy

00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:49.680
SEALs" from 1989.

00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:51.220
Notice those SEALs
are all handsome.

00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:52.440
Yeah.

00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:53.861
Tough crowd.

00:21:53.861 --> 00:21:54.360
So yeah.

00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:57.240
But I mean, the team is so big,
and it was so many years old

00:21:57.240 --> 00:21:59.280
that there's so much behind
the scenes that a lot of people

00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:00.155
don't get credit for.

00:22:00.155 --> 00:22:04.376
But just to see it all work and
come together the way it did,

00:22:04.376 --> 00:22:06.750
I'm probably talking too much,
but that was just awesome.

00:22:06.750 --> 00:22:08.400
SPEAKER: So since
leaving the SEAL teams,

00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:10.525
have you been involved in
any projects or work that

00:22:10.525 --> 00:22:13.080
takes maybe that
scope of people, too?

00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:15.750
ROB O'NEILL: Yes.

00:22:15.750 --> 00:22:17.460
One of the projects
that I have, I

00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:20.340
started a foundation to help
special operators transition

00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:24.210
from the military to
the private sector.

00:22:24.210 --> 00:22:27.070
I got out at just over 16 years.

00:22:27.070 --> 00:22:30.060
And I knew that in
order to get a pension,

00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:31.990
you need to do 20 for
retirement in the Navy.

00:22:31.990 --> 00:22:35.100
I knew I wouldn't get it, but
I knew it was time to leave.

00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:37.480
I didn't know what
I was going to do.

00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:39.660
But I also didn't
realize that I had skills

00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:41.700
that we'd acquired
in the military

00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:45.600
that the private
sector really wants--

00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:47.927
team building, stress
management, problem solving,

00:22:47.927 --> 00:22:50.010
outside-the-box thinking
that you just kind of get

00:22:50.010 --> 00:22:52.676
with experience.

00:22:52.676 --> 00:22:54.300
And I found that in
the private sector,

00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:55.300
and I was able to do it.

00:22:55.300 --> 00:22:56.850
But then I would go back to my--

00:22:56.850 --> 00:22:59.141
we've been at war for so long
that a lot of people, men

00:22:59.141 --> 00:23:00.870
and women, don't
want to do 20 years,

00:23:00.870 --> 00:23:02.970
and they kind of
want to get out now.

00:23:02.970 --> 00:23:06.257
So we've started Your Grateful
Nation that helps them do that.

00:23:06.257 --> 00:23:08.590
I know people, I'll tell them
about it, and they'll say,

00:23:08.590 --> 00:23:09.840
well, I don't have any skills.

00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:12.131
I'd rather go back to war
because that makes more sense

00:23:12.131 --> 00:23:13.380
than filling out a resume.

00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:15.090
And that's the way they think
because the government has

00:23:15.090 --> 00:23:16.840
no interest in
transitioning these people.

00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:20.790
So we work with that, and
now we give special operators

00:23:20.790 --> 00:23:23.400
individualized transitional
support starting off with,

00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:25.380
where do you want to live?

00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:27.437
What industry do
you want to be in?

00:23:27.437 --> 00:23:29.520
And then we find that
company, that city, and then

00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:32.760
we help them get a mentor, six
to nine months of training,

00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:35.640
and hopefully get them
into the private sector.

00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:38.420
The best email or
call that I get

00:23:38.420 --> 00:23:41.430
is usually from a
spouse of a veteran who

00:23:41.430 --> 00:23:45.254
says Your Grateful Nation helped
our family get a second career.

00:23:45.254 --> 00:23:47.420
So that's very fulfilling,
and it's good to do that.

00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:49.830
And the veterans
are special people.

00:23:49.830 --> 00:23:53.490
SPEAKER: Now, a
lot of people say

00:23:53.490 --> 00:23:54.990
that they felt this
sense of closure

00:23:54.990 --> 00:23:56.719
when the news about
bin Laden broke.

00:23:56.719 --> 00:23:58.260
Do you feel like
you were able to add

00:23:58.260 --> 00:24:00.960
to that sense of closure, coming
out as the SEAL who did it

00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:01.890
and writing the book?

00:24:01.890 --> 00:24:02.640
ROB O'NEILL: Yeah.

00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:04.380
That was part of the
reason I initially

00:24:04.380 --> 00:24:05.862
came out with this story.

00:24:05.862 --> 00:24:07.320
The book was for
different reasons,

00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:10.500
but the story was because
I donated the shirt

00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:13.200
that I wore on the mission
to the memorial in lower

00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:15.450
Manhattan, 9/11 Memorial.

00:24:15.450 --> 00:24:19.140
And part of the deal was
I donated that shirt,

00:24:19.140 --> 00:24:21.419
and then they give me a
private tour of the place

00:24:21.419 --> 00:24:22.960
without crowds there,
which was neat.

00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:26.190
But what I didn't know is
at the end of the tour,

00:24:26.190 --> 00:24:28.440
they had a room a
little bigger than this,

00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:33.210
and there was 35 family members
of people who lost loved ones--

00:24:33.210 --> 00:24:36.950
lost a wife, a sister,
a brother, a son--

00:24:36.950 --> 00:24:37.800
in the Trade Towers.

00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:39.180
And that's when they brought
me up, and they said,

00:24:39.180 --> 00:24:40.260
can you just tell
them what happened?

00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:41.634
That's the first
time in public I

00:24:41.634 --> 00:24:43.380
told the story about bin Laden.

00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:46.090
And just to see the reactions.

00:24:46.090 --> 00:24:47.820
They said there will
never be closure,

00:24:47.820 --> 00:24:49.420
but this helps with the healing.

00:24:49.420 --> 00:24:53.550
There's conspiracy
theories everywhere.

00:24:53.550 --> 00:24:55.950
Where's the picture,
bin Laden died in 2001,

00:24:55.950 --> 00:24:58.150
all this nonsense.

00:24:58.150 --> 00:25:02.130
But they said, finally a
real face, a real name,

00:25:02.130 --> 00:25:03.270
this helps me heal.

00:25:03.270 --> 00:25:05.370
And I go down there quite
a bit, and it's always

00:25:05.370 --> 00:25:08.192
something to go in
the 9/11 Memorial,

00:25:08.192 --> 00:25:09.650
especially in crazy
times like now,

00:25:09.650 --> 00:25:11.940
and just realize
what's important.

00:25:11.940 --> 00:25:13.780
And then you run
into family members.

00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:16.690
I've never heard the same
story twice, everything from I

00:25:16.690 --> 00:25:18.690
had a woman tell me the
story about her husband.

00:25:18.690 --> 00:25:20.030
She's on the phone.

00:25:20.030 --> 00:25:21.030
He's in the South Tower.

00:25:21.030 --> 00:25:21.946
She said just get out.

00:25:21.946 --> 00:25:22.560
Just get out.

00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:24.518
I know the North Tower's
hit, but just get out.

00:25:24.518 --> 00:25:27.420
And all of sudden, it goes
blank-- you know, dead.

00:25:27.420 --> 00:25:29.190
And just to have
those people tell me--

00:25:29.190 --> 00:25:30.690
if it helps them
with the closure

00:25:30.690 --> 00:25:33.920
and it can help hopefully
thousands more with closure,

00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:36.810
and all I need to do is
tell a story, I'll do it.

00:25:36.810 --> 00:25:39.510
You know, I've assumed risk
before, and I'll do it again.

00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:42.240
SPEAKER: Now, you're not the
only SEAL who's written a book.

00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:43.615
A couple of others
have come out,

00:25:43.615 --> 00:25:45.120
and they're on shelves now.

00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:49.470
Do you feel like some of those
Tier 1 operators-- so SEALs,

00:25:49.470 --> 00:25:50.750
Rangers, Delta--

00:25:50.750 --> 00:25:53.730
are feeling a growing
sense of responsibility

00:25:53.730 --> 00:25:55.410
to write these
memoirs, to educate

00:25:55.410 --> 00:25:56.410
the public a little bit?

00:25:56.410 --> 00:25:57.990
ROB O'NEILL: I think people are.

00:25:57.990 --> 00:26:01.830
A lot of the operators are,
and I think that's important.

00:26:01.830 --> 00:26:04.500
As long as it's done the right
way, as long as it's approved.

00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:06.330
My book was the first one
with the bin Laden raid in it

00:26:06.330 --> 00:26:08.121
that was approved by
the Pentagon, approved

00:26:08.121 --> 00:26:09.810
by the Department of
Defense, and it was

00:26:09.810 --> 00:26:11.101
given to the agencies involved.

00:26:11.101 --> 00:26:13.140
So here's a story
that they approved.

00:26:13.140 --> 00:26:15.120
As long as you're not
putting anyone in danger,

00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:17.800
giving up tactics, I think it's
important for history's sake.

00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:20.310
I mean, when George Washington
crossed the Delaware to fight

00:26:20.310 --> 00:26:23.970
the Hessians on Christmas Eve or
Christmas Day whichever it was,

00:26:23.970 --> 00:26:26.054
he had a biographer with him.

00:26:26.054 --> 00:26:27.720
We wouldn't know the
story if he didn't.

00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:29.345
It's important to
know what people did.

00:26:29.345 --> 00:26:32.600
And I hope everyone else that
was a part of the mission,

00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:34.740
they at least tell their
story or come out with it.

00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:36.740
Because there's going to
be 23 different stories

00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:40.260
on the ground alone, and
just to know what people did.

00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:43.110
I mentioned earlier
that we didn't

00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:45.000
know the other
helicopter had crashed.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.160
And we somehow got
into the thing.

00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:51.060
And I was in bin Laden's
house, and I'm in a room

00:26:51.060 --> 00:26:52.350
and I'm watching my guys work.

00:26:52.350 --> 00:26:55.200
I was fortunate the normal
plan didn't work because I just

00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:57.180
got a front-row seat
to watch this really

00:26:57.180 --> 00:26:58.480
cool mission happen.

00:26:58.480 --> 00:27:00.930
And as I'm in there, one
of the guys whispered--

00:27:00.930 --> 00:27:03.690
we don't talk a lot-- he said,
something something helicopter

00:27:03.690 --> 00:27:04.997
crashed.

00:27:04.997 --> 00:27:07.080
And I started thinking
about the other helicopters

00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:08.910
we might have in the area,
and I'm thinking maybe we

00:27:08.910 --> 00:27:09.810
just lost 30 guys.

00:27:09.810 --> 00:27:11.710
And I said, well, what
helicopter crashed?

00:27:11.710 --> 00:27:13.740
And he said, bro, our helicopter
crashed in the front yard.

00:27:13.740 --> 00:27:14.781
You walked right past it.

00:27:14.781 --> 00:27:16.001
And I'm like, OK.

00:27:16.001 --> 00:27:16.500
OK.

00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:17.250
Good.

00:27:17.250 --> 00:27:19.290
And as we're having
this conversation,

00:27:19.290 --> 00:27:22.230
one of our snipers who was doing
like a lap around the place

00:27:22.230 --> 00:27:23.680
to make sure no one escaped--

00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:24.900
he's securing the perimeter.

00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:27.150
As we're doing that,
he came to the spot

00:27:27.150 --> 00:27:29.084
where the tail was hanging over.

00:27:29.084 --> 00:27:31.500
We eventually saw the pictures
because when we blew it up,

00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:33.990
it fell, and that's how they
got part of the helicopter.

00:27:33.990 --> 00:27:36.060
So he was getting to that part.

00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:38.850
And he came over the radio and
said everybody, be on alert.

00:27:38.850 --> 00:27:40.690
They are definitely
ready for us.

00:27:40.690 --> 00:27:44.010
They've got a training mockup
of our super-secret helicopter

00:27:44.010 --> 00:27:47.260
in the front yard.

00:27:47.260 --> 00:27:48.300
And there was a pause.

00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:50.430
And the boss said,
well no, jackass.

00:27:50.430 --> 00:27:50.970
That's ours.

00:27:50.970 --> 00:27:51.600
We crashed.

00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:53.940
And you hear the
sniper go, yeah,

00:27:53.940 --> 00:27:57.249
that makes a lot more sense
than the shit I was just saying.

00:27:57.249 --> 00:27:59.415
There are stories out there
of stuff that people did

00:27:59.415 --> 00:28:01.380
and how they were
thinking, being so focused

00:28:01.380 --> 00:28:02.535
on this mission.

00:28:02.535 --> 00:28:06.070
These are great stories
from great people.

00:28:06.070 --> 00:28:07.200
It's a funny story.

00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:09.900
SPEAKER: I think that story
brings us to another point.

00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:11.280
It seems like
SEALs and operators

00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:13.196
have to have a really
good sense of humor just

00:28:13.196 --> 00:28:15.452
to weather how hard
the lifestyle is

00:28:15.452 --> 00:28:16.410
and the combat mission.

00:28:16.410 --> 00:28:17.305
ROB O'NEILL: Yes.

00:28:17.305 --> 00:28:19.680
SPEAKER: There are a couple
of funny stories in the book.

00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:20.967
There's a doorbell story.

00:28:20.967 --> 00:28:22.800
Are there any other
stories that you thought

00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:25.170
were really funny that
didn't make it in the book?

00:28:25.170 --> 00:28:27.607
ROB O'NEILL: Yeah.

00:28:27.607 --> 00:28:29.940
A lot of special operators
do have a good sense of humor

00:28:29.940 --> 00:28:31.898
because sometimes the
training and the missions

00:28:31.898 --> 00:28:35.400
get so hard that you'll
lose your mind if you

00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:36.510
can't laugh at yourself.

00:28:36.510 --> 00:28:39.150
Like, what horrible
decision got me here?

00:28:39.150 --> 00:28:42.620
So SEALs are pretty funny.

00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:43.660
It always comes to mind.

00:28:43.660 --> 00:28:46.020
We were talking
over lunch about how

00:28:46.020 --> 00:28:47.580
walking into a
spider web at night

00:28:47.580 --> 00:28:50.102
is the best kung fu
instructor on the planet.

00:28:50.102 --> 00:28:51.810
But every time someone
does that or falls

00:28:51.810 --> 00:28:54.894
in a hole, someone
from the back you

00:28:54.894 --> 00:28:56.310
just here, yeah,
elite Navy SEALs,

00:28:56.310 --> 00:28:59.017
they should make a
movie about this.

00:28:59.017 --> 00:29:00.600
I don't know if it's
in the book and I

00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:02.940
don't think it does it
justice, but the first time

00:29:02.940 --> 00:29:08.420
we realized SEALs were funny was
the very first day of training.

00:29:08.420 --> 00:29:11.829
We all knew that we were
getting into SEAL training,

00:29:11.829 --> 00:29:13.120
but we didn't know what it was.

00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:15.450
So they sat us down, about
this many people, sailors

00:29:15.450 --> 00:29:17.820
that wanted to be SEALs.

00:29:17.820 --> 00:29:19.290
We didn't know what
the course was,

00:29:19.290 --> 00:29:22.570
so a SEAL came in to
tell us what to expect.

00:29:22.570 --> 00:29:24.690
So we're sitting there,
and he came walking in.

00:29:24.690 --> 00:29:26.850
I think it was the first
SEAL I'd ever seen.

00:29:26.850 --> 00:29:28.550
And he came walking in--

00:29:28.550 --> 00:29:31.450
camouflage pants, blouse, and
the boots, tight blue T-shirt,

00:29:31.450 --> 00:29:33.120
tattoos down to his knuckles.

00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:34.620
And we're looking
at him like you're

00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:38.830
looking at me, except we were
terrified, and he knew that.

00:29:38.830 --> 00:29:42.600
So we didn't know how serious
he was, and he waited there

00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:43.110
in silence.

00:29:43.110 --> 00:29:46.880
And he finally said,
looking good today, gents.

00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:49.014
Not you, me.

00:29:49.014 --> 00:29:50.180
I know what you're thinking.

00:29:50.180 --> 00:29:51.096
I look a little tired.

00:29:51.096 --> 00:29:52.182
It's because I am.

00:29:52.182 --> 00:29:54.350
I was up all night.

00:29:54.350 --> 00:29:57.470
I had to get my
wife out of jail.

00:29:57.470 --> 00:30:00.210
She was arrested
for shoplifting.

00:30:00.210 --> 00:30:03.270
Earlier that afternoon, we
were leaving the mall together.

00:30:03.270 --> 00:30:04.480
She had her arm around me.

00:30:07.540 --> 00:30:10.650
Security thought she was trying
to steal an anatomy chart.

00:30:10.650 --> 00:30:12.410
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:12.410 --> 00:30:14.320
So that's the first
thing a SEAL ever said.

00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:17.020
And we're like, what is
this complete psychopath

00:30:17.020 --> 00:30:18.680
talking about?

00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:20.920
But he was early and
bored, and he was actually

00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:23.862
using our fear for his benefit.

00:30:23.862 --> 00:30:24.820
Anyway, that's a story.

00:30:24.820 --> 00:30:26.861
I don't know if you can
tell that one in the book

00:30:26.861 --> 00:30:28.197
because it's more visual.

00:30:28.197 --> 00:30:28.780
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:30:28.780 --> 00:30:29.710
I think it's in the book.

00:30:29.710 --> 00:30:30.376
ROB O'NEILL: Oh.

00:30:30.376 --> 00:30:32.890
Sorry for ruining the book.

00:30:32.890 --> 00:30:34.540
SPEAKER: Not to ruin
the book anymore,

00:30:34.540 --> 00:30:36.280
but I really liked
the doorbell story.

00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:37.196
Can you tell that one?

00:30:37.196 --> 00:30:39.040
ROB O'NEILL: Yes.

00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:44.260
Again, I'm a big believer that
failure is a learning tool.

00:30:44.260 --> 00:30:46.090
People fail every
single day a lot.

00:30:46.090 --> 00:30:49.542
And as long as you acknowledge
it and own it, look yourself

00:30:49.542 --> 00:30:51.250
in the mirror, why
did I fail, what can I

00:30:51.250 --> 00:30:54.202
learn to teach my team, you
can get something out of it.

00:30:54.202 --> 00:30:56.410
One thing we learned-- and
there is a lesson to this.

00:30:56.410 --> 00:30:57.730
We actually applied it.

00:30:57.730 --> 00:31:02.260
But we learned along the way
that it's better to, instead

00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:05.170
of landing in a helicopter
right next to the target

00:31:05.170 --> 00:31:06.670
and waking everyone
up, you should

00:31:06.670 --> 00:31:08.710
land far away where they
can't hear you and walk in.

00:31:08.710 --> 00:31:11.084
Instead of putting a bomb on
the door, you pick the lock.

00:31:11.084 --> 00:31:12.280
And then you go inside.

00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:13.450
It's a lot quieter.

00:31:13.450 --> 00:31:15.370
There's a lot less
collateral damage.

00:31:15.370 --> 00:31:16.870
Innocent people don't get hurt.

00:31:16.870 --> 00:31:19.960
So we were in Iraq
in about 2007,

00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:21.836
and we're walking up to a house.

00:31:21.836 --> 00:31:23.710
But as we're walking
up-- and I was in front,

00:31:23.710 --> 00:31:24.880
I was the point man--

00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:26.882
I could see people
moving in the house.

00:31:26.882 --> 00:31:28.840
Through the windows, you
can sort of hear them.

00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:30.670
So they know
something's outside.

00:31:30.670 --> 00:31:33.340
Now, we're going after
a high-value individual,

00:31:33.340 --> 00:31:35.230
so we're not going to leave.

00:31:35.230 --> 00:31:36.880
Now, we do need to
escalate the force.

00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:39.160
Now, we probably need to
put a bomb on the door

00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:41.800
because there are bad
guys in there, whatever.

00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:44.159
So I had to call up
a breacher to get it.

00:31:44.159 --> 00:31:45.700
A breacher is a
methods-of-entry guy.

00:31:45.700 --> 00:31:50.876
He will put a bomb on the door,
put a saw through the wall,

00:31:50.876 --> 00:31:52.000
break the window, whatever.

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.160
He's going to get you in
to where you're going.

00:31:54.160 --> 00:31:56.110
So he came up and
he wanted to put a--

00:31:56.110 --> 00:31:58.470
There's a bomb we use called C6.

00:31:58.470 --> 00:31:59.980
It's a seven-foot charge.

00:31:59.980 --> 00:32:01.450
You've probably
heard of C4 before.

00:32:01.450 --> 00:32:02.130
This is C6.

00:32:02.130 --> 00:32:02.920
It's bigger.

00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:07.780
And C6, it actually looks like
a Fruit Roll-Up, same color,

00:32:07.780 --> 00:32:09.130
and it's about that big.

00:32:09.130 --> 00:32:11.800
And all you do is walk up to
the door, and it's sticky.

00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:14.530
You stick it on, and
you roll it down.

00:32:14.530 --> 00:32:15.970
It should be capped in.

00:32:15.970 --> 00:32:18.610
You walk to a safe distance,
and you hit the magic button.

00:32:18.610 --> 00:32:19.360
Big loud boom.

00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:20.110
The door opens.

00:32:20.110 --> 00:32:22.090
It's crazy.

00:32:22.090 --> 00:32:25.280
Now, he's going to do that
with both sets of hands.

00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:28.955
So he slings his weapon.

00:32:28.955 --> 00:32:29.830
So he needs security.

00:32:29.830 --> 00:32:31.030
That's going to be me.

00:32:31.030 --> 00:32:32.830
So I'm walking up to
the door, and the door

00:32:32.830 --> 00:32:34.660
would open like this.

00:32:34.660 --> 00:32:36.135
So we know the hinges are here.

00:32:36.135 --> 00:32:38.010
He's going to put the
bomb on the hinge side,

00:32:38.010 --> 00:32:38.950
so that will push them off.

00:32:38.950 --> 00:32:41.158
And I'm just going to hold
right here to protect him.

00:32:41.158 --> 00:32:43.000
As we're doing this, my boss--

00:32:45.550 --> 00:32:48.550
I've been working with for 13
years, one of the best SEALs,

00:32:48.550 --> 00:32:49.960
never screwed anything up--

00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:53.350
he's watching, and he wants
to come up to observe.

00:32:53.350 --> 00:32:56.270
Not to micromanage, he just
wants to see what's going on.

00:32:56.270 --> 00:32:59.680
And that's when he put his
elbow right on the doorbell.

00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:03.199
So it's kind of like bing.

00:33:03.199 --> 00:33:04.990
And you could see it
was thinking about it,

00:33:04.990 --> 00:33:06.573
like he doesn't want
to move his elbow

00:33:06.573 --> 00:33:09.270
because the inevitable bong.

00:33:09.270 --> 00:33:10.900
Now, the breacher
had the bomb out,

00:33:10.900 --> 00:33:13.699
and he's like right about here.

00:33:13.699 --> 00:33:15.740
And he can't yell at him
because that's his boss.

00:33:15.740 --> 00:33:22.180
So he just goes [BREATHING]
Then you see his wheel spinning.

00:33:22.180 --> 00:33:23.760
And he's fiscally conservative.

00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:26.170
He doesn't want to waste
of taxpayers' money.

00:33:26.170 --> 00:33:29.530
So he starts reeling it back up.

00:33:29.530 --> 00:33:31.891
And he puts in his pocket.

00:33:31.891 --> 00:33:34.140
Now, I'm right here watching
this whole thing go down.

00:33:34.140 --> 00:33:35.735
I don't want to be here anymore.

00:33:35.735 --> 00:33:37.360
Because what the bad
guys do is they'll

00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:38.590
start shooting right
through the door.

00:33:38.590 --> 00:33:40.548
And unlike Hollywood,
bullets go through stuff,

00:33:40.548 --> 00:33:42.636
and I don't want to be
a part of that equation.

00:33:42.636 --> 00:33:45.010
So I'm contemplating how to
get us both out of this spot.

00:33:45.010 --> 00:33:46.218
Time's kind of moving slowly.

00:33:46.218 --> 00:33:46.940
The door opens.

00:33:46.940 --> 00:33:50.050
It's the goddamn terrorists
we're looking for.

00:33:50.050 --> 00:33:52.650
So he and I share
like an awkward--

00:33:52.650 --> 00:33:53.950
Oh, and I start thinking, oh.

00:33:53.950 --> 00:33:55.570
So I grab him.

00:33:55.570 --> 00:33:56.371
We cuffed him.

00:33:56.371 --> 00:33:58.120
And I had a knee in
the small of his back.

00:33:58.120 --> 00:33:59.680
And I looked at my
boss, and go shit,

00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:02.710
let's just do that every night.

00:34:02.710 --> 00:34:06.670
So the moral of that, what we
learned from that failure--

00:34:06.670 --> 00:34:09.100
because we've been working
in Afghanistan for so long--

00:34:09.100 --> 00:34:11.739
there are not doorbells
on houses in Afghanistan.

00:34:11.739 --> 00:34:13.600
There are in Iraq.

00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:14.600
Stay off the wall.

00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:16.350
SPEAKER: Good lesson,
everybody out there.

00:34:16.350 --> 00:34:19.659
ROB O'NEILL: Don't
ring the doorbells.

00:34:19.659 --> 00:34:21.150
That happened.

00:34:21.150 --> 00:34:23.420
SPEAKER: There have
been a lot of films,

00:34:23.420 --> 00:34:27.010
books about high-profile
missions you've been on,

00:34:27.010 --> 00:34:30.610
obviously the raid on bin Laden,
the rescue of Captain Richard

00:34:30.610 --> 00:34:33.721
Phillips, and Lone
Survivor Marcus Luttrell.

00:34:33.721 --> 00:34:34.429
ROB O'NEILL: Yes.

00:34:34.429 --> 00:34:36.409
SPEAKER: As as someone
who was there in person,

00:34:36.409 --> 00:34:40.989
what was your favorite book
or movie of those events?

00:34:40.989 --> 00:34:42.520
ROB O'NEILL: Both
"Lone Survivor,"

00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:44.980
my favorite book and movie.

00:34:44.980 --> 00:34:47.659
The movie is really good.

00:34:47.659 --> 00:34:49.090
I tell people, if
you want to know

00:34:49.090 --> 00:34:50.923
what a fight in the
mountains of Afghanistan

00:34:50.923 --> 00:34:53.044
looks like, "Lone Survivor."

00:34:53.044 --> 00:34:53.710
All good movies.

00:34:53.710 --> 00:34:55.330
I think they did a good job.

00:34:55.330 --> 00:34:59.980
Like I said, "Zero Dark
Thirty" did an excellent job

00:34:59.980 --> 00:35:02.230
showing the analysts
behind everything

00:35:02.230 --> 00:35:06.140
and how their passion found him.

00:35:06.140 --> 00:35:07.990
"American Sniper"
did a really good job

00:35:07.990 --> 00:35:10.420
showing some of the
post-traumatic effects

00:35:10.420 --> 00:35:12.160
of the families,
excellent job with that.

00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:13.390
Didn't like the fake
baby in that one.

00:35:13.390 --> 00:35:14.710
Did you see the fake baby?

00:35:14.710 --> 00:35:15.340
Do you remember that?

00:35:15.340 --> 00:35:15.595
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:35:15.595 --> 00:35:16.000
I think I do.

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:16.310
ROB O'NEILL: Yeah.

00:35:16.310 --> 00:35:16.980
Google-- Google?

00:35:16.980 --> 00:35:17.920
Get it.

00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:19.324
Google fake baby
"Lone Survivor."

00:35:19.324 --> 00:35:19.990
You'll see that.

00:35:24.250 --> 00:35:26.390
"Lone Survivor," excellent,
like I just mentioned.

00:35:26.390 --> 00:35:27.640
And then what was the other one?

00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:28.990
SPEAKER: You're not
a Tom Hanks fan.

00:35:28.990 --> 00:35:29.656
ROB O'NEILL: No.

00:35:29.656 --> 00:35:30.823
"Captain Phillips," awesome.

00:35:30.823 --> 00:35:32.405
No, that was a good
movie because they

00:35:32.405 --> 00:35:33.530
made SEALs look good.

00:35:33.530 --> 00:35:34.030
SPEAKER: OK.

00:35:34.030 --> 00:35:35.506
ROB O'NEILL: No, they did.

00:35:35.506 --> 00:35:36.880
You'll notice,
when the guys took

00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:39.920
the shots, the first thing,
they did took the shots,

00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:42.289
and they pulled their
bipods up and left.

00:35:42.289 --> 00:35:43.330
They didn't say anything.

00:35:43.330 --> 00:35:44.538
There was no Hollywood lines.

00:35:44.538 --> 00:35:46.534
Because when that
was over, I remember

00:35:46.534 --> 00:35:48.700
talking to the snipers--
this was before bin Laden--

00:35:48.700 --> 00:35:50.790
so I was like, you realize
this is the-- you just

00:35:50.790 --> 00:35:53.410
did like the single greatest
thing in the history

00:35:53.410 --> 00:35:54.700
of the SEAL teams.

00:35:54.700 --> 00:35:57.200
And the sniper looked at me
and said, cool, can we go home?

00:35:57.200 --> 00:35:58.310
That's just the way he acted.

00:35:58.310 --> 00:35:58.790
And it's funny, too.

00:35:58.790 --> 00:36:00.820
They asked me how
accurate that movie is.

00:36:00.820 --> 00:36:02.680
And I said, depends
on who's asking.

00:36:02.680 --> 00:36:05.860
Like, in a forum
here, 70% accurate.

00:36:05.860 --> 00:36:08.132
Happy hour, if a lady
asked me, 100% accurate.

00:36:08.132 --> 00:36:09.090
I took all three shots.

00:36:09.090 --> 00:36:10.745
SPEAKER: 150% yeah.

00:36:10.745 --> 00:36:12.120
ROB O'NEILL:
Completely accurate.

00:36:12.120 --> 00:36:13.578
SPEAKER: So in a
few minutes, we're

00:36:13.578 --> 00:36:15.260
going to go to Q&amp;A
in the audience.

00:36:15.260 --> 00:36:17.050
So if anyone wants to
step up to the mics,

00:36:17.050 --> 00:36:19.300
if you have any
questions, feel free.

00:36:19.300 --> 00:36:20.770
While we're waiting
for that, Rob,

00:36:20.770 --> 00:36:25.330
could you tell us about the
creative process for the book?

00:36:25.330 --> 00:36:28.466
Was that a new hurdle for
you writing in that form,

00:36:28.466 --> 00:36:30.715
trying to recall all these
missions for so many years?

00:36:30.715 --> 00:36:31.465
ROB O'NEILL: Yeah.

00:36:31.465 --> 00:36:35.740
It was new, but I'd
been keeping a journal

00:36:35.740 --> 00:36:38.300
since training just because it
seemed like the thing to do.

00:36:38.300 --> 00:36:39.460
Even though there
wasn't a lot going on,

00:36:39.460 --> 00:36:41.626
I always thought maybe if
there's a good story here,

00:36:41.626 --> 00:36:42.939
I could possibly tell it.

00:36:42.939 --> 00:36:44.980
So I was able to go through
a lot of my old stuff

00:36:44.980 --> 00:36:46.070
and recall a lot of stuff.

00:36:46.070 --> 00:36:48.395
And I actually talked to
some of my guys before it.

00:36:48.395 --> 00:36:51.020
And then just to sit down and go
through and kind of break it--

00:36:51.020 --> 00:36:53.680
I initially wanted 11 chapters.

00:36:53.680 --> 00:36:55.970
It came out to like 26
or something like that.

00:36:55.970 --> 00:36:59.380
But just interesting stories,
different parts of life.

00:36:59.380 --> 00:37:01.720
The creative process
was good because it

00:37:01.720 --> 00:37:03.407
seemed pretty normal.

00:37:03.407 --> 00:37:04.990
I had some help
writing it, obviously,

00:37:04.990 --> 00:37:06.156
and then some great editors.

00:37:06.156 --> 00:37:09.500
So they could dot the i's
and all the good stuff.

00:37:09.500 --> 00:37:10.320
It was fun.

00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:11.000
SPEAKER: Great.

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:12.458
So I think we'll
go to the audience

00:37:12.458 --> 00:37:13.471
for our first question.

00:37:13.471 --> 00:37:13.970
Hi.

00:37:13.970 --> 00:37:14.420
ROB O'NEILL: Hello.

00:37:14.420 --> 00:37:17.044
AUDIENCE: So you talked a little
bit about transitioning people

00:37:17.044 --> 00:37:18.370
to the private sector.

00:37:18.370 --> 00:37:21.450
I'm wondering what
parts of life as a SEAL,

00:37:21.450 --> 00:37:22.919
like management things--

00:37:22.919 --> 00:37:24.460
I mean, obviously
not the big stuff--

00:37:24.460 --> 00:37:27.680
but what small elements of
management or team building

00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:29.290
do you think really,
really translate,

00:37:29.290 --> 00:37:33.201
and anyone can take away
when they're building a team?

00:37:33.201 --> 00:37:34.950
ROB O'NEILL: Probably
just accountability.

00:37:34.950 --> 00:37:37.300
We were big into saying
you take care of your gear,

00:37:37.300 --> 00:37:38.581
your gear takes care of you.

00:37:38.581 --> 00:37:41.080
So the whole thing is like,
when you're done with something,

00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:43.354
clean it now and do everything
like you'd do anything.

00:37:43.354 --> 00:37:45.270
And then keep an inventory
of what you've got,

00:37:45.270 --> 00:37:46.960
and then also know where your
friend's stuff is in case

00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:47.950
they're not around.

00:37:47.950 --> 00:37:51.250
Because we would
keep our stuff in--

00:37:51.250 --> 00:37:53.024
everybody had
these huge lockers.

00:37:53.024 --> 00:37:54.940
And we would keep our
lockers in certain bags.

00:37:54.940 --> 00:37:56.523
And the bags are
full of gear designed

00:37:56.523 --> 00:37:57.650
for a certain environment.

00:37:57.650 --> 00:37:59.980
So you have these different
bags for like a water jump,

00:37:59.980 --> 00:38:03.120
land jump, high-altitude diving,
desert, jungle, all that stuff.

00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:03.997
And what's in it?

00:38:03.997 --> 00:38:05.830
And you just want to
keep care of your stuff

00:38:05.830 --> 00:38:08.500
because you're going to need
a lot of different stuff

00:38:08.500 --> 00:38:12.970
in the jungle than you will on
a night jump into Afghanistan

00:38:12.970 --> 00:38:13.490
or whatever.

00:38:13.490 --> 00:38:15.310
So just the accountability
of your gear and knowing

00:38:15.310 --> 00:38:16.090
where your people are.

00:38:16.090 --> 00:38:18.010
And then the two beer
limit was really good.

00:38:21.130 --> 00:38:23.350
AUDIENCE: Do you have
any tips for civilians

00:38:23.350 --> 00:38:26.170
for building up that mental
dexterity that you talk about?

00:38:26.170 --> 00:38:29.370
You know, that
focus, that ability

00:38:29.370 --> 00:38:35.591
to push out that negativity
and really focus on the goal?

00:38:35.591 --> 00:38:36.340
ROB O'NEILL: Yeah.

00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:38.482
I mean, the biggest
one is the realization

00:38:38.482 --> 00:38:40.190
that you're probably
not going to succeed

00:38:40.190 --> 00:38:41.110
on the first attempt.

00:38:43.690 --> 00:38:46.930
One of my legitimate answers
to that, too, it's funny--

00:38:46.930 --> 00:38:49.896
I don't keep them mean
to keep making jokes--

00:38:49.896 --> 00:38:51.270
but I would say
stay off Facebook

00:38:51.270 --> 00:38:53.335
because that's where
the negativity is.

00:38:53.335 --> 00:38:56.930
That just struck me as funny
that comes to mind here again.

00:38:56.930 --> 00:39:00.490
Seriously, like I
mentioned earlier,

00:39:00.490 --> 00:39:02.980
failure is a learning tool.

00:39:02.980 --> 00:39:06.052
You're not going to
make it every time.

00:39:06.052 --> 00:39:07.510
You know, chances
are what you were

00:39:07.510 --> 00:39:09.040
planning didn't happen anyway.

00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:12.490
I didn't mention all this stuff
before, but just keep at it.

00:39:12.490 --> 00:39:15.230
And if you want to be good at
anything, do it 1,000 times.

00:39:15.230 --> 00:39:16.860
Like people will say, how
do I get better pull-ups?

00:39:16.860 --> 00:39:17.360
Oh, simple.

00:39:17.360 --> 00:39:18.770
Do more pull-ups.

00:39:18.770 --> 00:39:19.396
You'll be good.

00:39:19.396 --> 00:39:21.686
SPEAKER: So Rob, you actually
have an interesting story

00:39:21.686 --> 00:39:23.180
on repetition and
learning things.

00:39:23.180 --> 00:39:25.932
Can you tell us about your
dad and the free throws story?

00:39:25.932 --> 00:39:26.640
ROB O'NEILL: Yes.

00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:29.770
We, my father and I,
played basketball everyday.

00:39:29.770 --> 00:39:31.180
He played in college.

00:39:31.180 --> 00:39:32.290
I played in college.

00:39:32.290 --> 00:39:35.500
And one of our rules
is when my season

00:39:35.500 --> 00:39:37.780
would end with whatever,
junior high or high school,

00:39:37.780 --> 00:39:39.340
our season would start.

00:39:39.340 --> 00:39:41.080
And we'd play two to
three hours a day.

00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:44.549
But one of our rules is, no
matter, as soon as we finish,

00:39:44.549 --> 00:39:46.090
we don't get to
leave until one of us

00:39:46.090 --> 00:39:48.130
makes 20 free throws in a row.

00:39:48.130 --> 00:39:50.506
So it would start with a make,
and then one guy rebounds.

00:39:50.506 --> 00:39:52.880
You start with a make, and
then you shoot until you miss.

00:39:52.880 --> 00:39:54.050
Then you switch.

00:39:54.050 --> 00:39:57.310
And so it was a 20 to
leave the gym every day,

00:39:57.310 --> 00:40:00.790
but then it was 20
to get a steak dinner

00:40:00.790 --> 00:40:02.890
at the Derby in Butte, Montana.

00:40:02.890 --> 00:40:05.020
But once you got the steak,
then it moved up by 25.

00:40:05.020 --> 00:40:07.200
So it's 20 to leave the
gym, then 25 for a steak.

00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:09.760
Then it's 20 and
30, then 35, 40.

00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:12.730
And we got to a point
where my father,

00:40:12.730 --> 00:40:15.370
I think he made
92 in a row, which

00:40:15.370 --> 00:40:19.170
was the family record for
a week because I made 105.

00:40:19.170 --> 00:40:19.910
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:19.910 --> 00:40:21.660
But again, that's just
the way we learned.

00:40:21.660 --> 00:40:23.284
That's how we learned
how to shoot free

00:40:23.284 --> 00:40:25.720
throws, how to shoot weapons,
just repetition, repetition.

00:40:25.720 --> 00:40:26.230
Do it again.

00:40:26.230 --> 00:40:28.877
Training, communication,
repetition.

00:40:28.877 --> 00:40:30.210
I hope I answered your question.

00:40:30.210 --> 00:40:30.603
AUDIENCE: You did.

00:40:30.603 --> 00:40:31.102
Thank you.

00:40:31.102 --> 00:40:32.269
ROB O'NEILL: You're welcome.

00:40:32.269 --> 00:40:33.977
SPEAKER: Next question
on the right here.

00:40:33.977 --> 00:40:34.689
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:40:34.689 --> 00:40:36.730
This is something I've
been really curious about.

00:40:36.730 --> 00:40:38.710
I mean, with you and
the other SEALs that

00:40:38.710 --> 00:40:46.480
have put out books and movies,
you become famous after that.

00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:51.780
And from the
American perspective,

00:40:51.780 --> 00:40:55.480
you're a well-known hero,
but from the opposition's

00:40:55.480 --> 00:41:01.720
perspective, you're also a
well-known person who probably

00:41:01.720 --> 00:41:06.607
they have vowed revenge against
after the various operations

00:41:06.607 --> 00:41:07.690
they you were involved in.

00:41:07.690 --> 00:41:08.481
ROB O'NEILL: Right.

00:41:08.481 --> 00:41:10.180
AUDIENCE: So how do
you deal with that?

00:41:10.180 --> 00:41:10.720
ROB O'NEILL: No, that's fair.

00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:12.210
That's a good question, too.

00:41:12.210 --> 00:41:16.090
That's a tough one because
the realization is there.

00:41:16.090 --> 00:41:21.670
This mission was so high
profile that the details got out

00:41:21.670 --> 00:41:24.370
in small circles right
after the mission.

00:41:24.370 --> 00:41:26.860
We flew out right after it
was over back to Virginia.

00:41:26.860 --> 00:41:28.860
And by the time we got
back, everybody on both--

00:41:28.860 --> 00:41:31.509
we have SEAL teams in
Virginia and California--

00:41:31.509 --> 00:41:33.550
every SEAL knew what
happened and knew the names.

00:41:33.550 --> 00:41:34.760
And then it spread up to DC.

00:41:34.760 --> 00:41:36.370
I got a call from a friend
who worked in the White House.

00:41:36.370 --> 00:41:37.911
They knew my name
and all this stuff.

00:41:40.870 --> 00:41:43.210
There's a lot of different
reasons why you say anything.

00:41:43.210 --> 00:41:45.730
The book has nothing
to do with this.

00:41:45.730 --> 00:41:48.569
I believe it was better
to know the threat's real

00:41:48.569 --> 00:41:50.860
than to stick my head in the
sand and pretend it's not.

00:41:50.860 --> 00:41:53.650
Because it got out, I was
aware right off the bat

00:41:53.650 --> 00:41:55.730
that something bad could happen.

00:41:55.730 --> 00:41:59.290
I took a lot of security
precautions, with my family,

00:41:59.290 --> 00:42:01.550
with my kids, and
stuff like that.

00:42:01.550 --> 00:42:02.180
And it's tough.

00:42:02.180 --> 00:42:02.680
It's hard.

00:42:02.680 --> 00:42:03.679
It's still hard on them.

00:42:03.679 --> 00:42:06.280
My kids don't have the
same life they used to.

00:42:06.280 --> 00:42:09.250
They have more guns and
dogs, which is cool.

00:42:09.250 --> 00:42:10.750
But yes, it's a tough one.

00:42:10.750 --> 00:42:16.630
But again, coming out with
a story on television,

00:42:16.630 --> 00:42:18.460
I will assume the
risk if I can, if I

00:42:18.460 --> 00:42:20.250
need to to help with
the healing process

00:42:20.250 --> 00:42:21.310
because it is such a big thing.

00:42:21.310 --> 00:42:22.476
I've dealt with them before.

00:42:22.476 --> 00:42:24.940
I know what it's like.

00:42:24.940 --> 00:42:29.277
It wasn't a one-day decision,
and it's a tough one.

00:42:29.277 --> 00:42:30.110
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:42:30.110 --> 00:42:31.206
ROB O'NEILL: Thank you.

00:42:31.206 --> 00:42:32.300
SPEAKER: Left side here.

00:42:32.300 --> 00:42:33.530
AUDIENCE: First of
all, thank you again

00:42:33.530 --> 00:42:35.000
for coming and making the time.

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:35.510
ROB O'NEILL: Certainly.

00:42:35.510 --> 00:42:36.330
Thanks for having me.

00:42:36.330 --> 00:42:37.790
AUDIENCE: I had a
question for you.

00:42:37.790 --> 00:42:42.830
It's seen that online there
were a few other Navy SEALs that

00:42:42.830 --> 00:42:44.990
were somewhat critical
of you coming out

00:42:44.990 --> 00:42:48.620
as the individual operator
who killed Osama bin Laden.

00:42:48.620 --> 00:42:51.350
So I was wondering if
that kind of attitude

00:42:51.350 --> 00:42:54.000
is widespread amongst the
SEALs, and if you thought--

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:56.000
ROB O'NEILL: It differs.

00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:58.580
SEALs, they're an odd group.

00:42:58.580 --> 00:42:59.300
Love them.

00:42:59.300 --> 00:43:02.224
Some of my best times of my
life were in the SEAL teams.

00:43:02.224 --> 00:43:03.890
What you'll notice
about a lot of people

00:43:03.890 --> 00:43:06.500
in that, especially get to
the command where I was,

00:43:06.500 --> 00:43:09.440
the Tier 1 team, everyone
there is such an alpha

00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:12.512
that they're so used to being
the person that doesn't fail.

00:43:12.512 --> 00:43:13.970
The way that I put
it with them is,

00:43:13.970 --> 00:43:16.400
if you took 10 of
those guys and you

00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:19.370
put a dump truck full of cash
in each one of their driveways,

00:43:19.370 --> 00:43:21.536
five of them would be pissed
because their drive was

00:43:21.536 --> 00:43:22.640
blocked.

00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:26.572
They're going to be
mad about something.

00:43:26.572 --> 00:43:28.280
If they're upset with
me and they served,

00:43:28.280 --> 00:43:29.120
I respect their opinion.

00:43:29.120 --> 00:43:29.540
It's fine.

00:43:29.540 --> 00:43:30.500
I try to avoid negativity.

00:43:30.500 --> 00:43:31.220
I don't have time for it.

00:43:31.220 --> 00:43:33.020
I don't think trashing each
other is going to help anybody.

00:43:33.020 --> 00:43:34.400
If they weren't there,
I don't really care.

00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:35.240
Whatever.

00:43:35.240 --> 00:43:36.920
Get on with yourself.

00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:39.837
But no, I listen to it.

00:43:39.837 --> 00:43:41.420
I try to avoid some
of the chat rooms.

00:43:41.420 --> 00:43:42.605
A lot of them are negative.

00:43:42.605 --> 00:43:43.610
A lot of them are positive.

00:43:43.610 --> 00:43:44.850
I talked to a little
more than half

00:43:44.850 --> 00:43:45.920
of the guys that
were on the mission.

00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:47.060
They've come around.

00:43:47.060 --> 00:43:49.142
Time heals everything.

00:43:49.142 --> 00:43:51.350
I've never come out and
said, look at me, look at me,

00:43:51.350 --> 00:43:51.890
look what I did.

00:43:51.890 --> 00:43:53.810
It's like, look, I was
part of a great team,

00:43:53.810 --> 00:43:54.920
got there because
of great people,

00:43:54.920 --> 00:43:56.503
and great women
showed us where to go.

00:43:56.503 --> 00:43:58.340
I happened to turn
to the right corner.

00:43:58.340 --> 00:43:59.490
And here's my life story.

00:43:59.490 --> 00:44:00.890
And I'm just
telling a biography.

00:44:00.890 --> 00:44:03.580
I mean, none of it's easy, but
that's why they have scotch.

00:44:03.580 --> 00:44:05.077
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:05.077 --> 00:44:05.910
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:44:05.910 --> 00:44:08.310
ROB O'NEILL: Sure.

00:44:08.310 --> 00:44:08.810
SPEAKER: OK.

00:44:08.810 --> 00:44:10.130
Next question.

00:44:10.130 --> 00:44:12.050
AUDIENCE: Part of being
in the military means

00:44:12.050 --> 00:44:15.560
that you get orders and you kind
of just have to follow them.

00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:17.360
How do you reconcile
this with the kind

00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:19.880
of you having your own
opinions or not being

00:44:19.880 --> 00:44:21.530
kind of in agreement with them?

00:44:21.530 --> 00:44:23.020
How has that impacted you?

00:44:23.020 --> 00:44:25.010
ROB O'NEILL: Now, that's
a good question, too.

00:44:25.010 --> 00:44:28.692
I think what I've
noticed the most is--

00:44:28.692 --> 00:44:30.650
I worked for President
Clinton, President Bush,

00:44:30.650 --> 00:44:31.850
and President Obama--

00:44:31.850 --> 00:44:33.500
and regardless of
your political views

00:44:33.500 --> 00:44:35.791
or who's in charge, if you
find yourself in a situation

00:44:35.791 --> 00:44:38.090
where you are dealing
with a defined enemy

00:44:38.090 --> 00:44:39.590
and we're trying
to kill each other,

00:44:39.590 --> 00:44:41.690
it no longer becomes
about the politics or even

00:44:41.690 --> 00:44:43.730
the war effort itself
or the battle space.

00:44:43.730 --> 00:44:47.360
It becomes about fighting in
that house with my teammates

00:44:47.360 --> 00:44:48.110
next to me.

00:44:48.110 --> 00:44:49.761
So it's kind of easy
to do it that way.

00:44:49.761 --> 00:44:51.260
If there's a threat,
I'm going to do

00:44:51.260 --> 00:44:52.718
what I can to
eliminate the threat,

00:44:52.718 --> 00:44:55.610
and I'm going to try
to save my teammates.

00:44:55.610 --> 00:44:58.432
And then the military
is really good about,

00:44:58.432 --> 00:45:00.140
even in the public
eye, when you're still

00:45:00.140 --> 00:45:01.610
serving, in uniform,
you're not allowed

00:45:01.610 --> 00:45:04.068
to express your political views
if you want to on the side.

00:45:04.068 --> 00:45:08.826
So they try to keep it that way.

00:45:08.826 --> 00:45:10.700
I agreed with a lot of
the stuff that we did.

00:45:10.700 --> 00:45:13.657
And I think that came because
we had trained for so long

00:45:13.657 --> 00:45:15.740
to fight before we fight
that it was kind of like,

00:45:15.740 --> 00:45:17.000
I just want to get in the fight.

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:17.600
I want to fight.

00:45:17.600 --> 00:45:18.710
I want a war because
I want to fight.

00:45:18.710 --> 00:45:20.210
Now, it's like with
the Korea thing,

00:45:20.210 --> 00:45:22.237
it's like everybody
take a wrap off.

00:45:22.237 --> 00:45:24.320
Let's not go nuking each
other just because that's

00:45:24.320 --> 00:45:26.180
the word of the day.

00:45:26.180 --> 00:45:29.340
Those are big explosions.

00:45:29.340 --> 00:45:30.780
I hope I answered your question.

00:45:30.780 --> 00:45:31.530
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:45:31.530 --> 00:45:32.860
ROB O'NEILL: OK, Cool.

00:45:32.860 --> 00:45:34.410
SPEAKER: I think,
Rob, that brings up

00:45:34.410 --> 00:45:37.920
another interesting point, the
presence of like social media

00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:40.680
in today's military.

00:45:40.680 --> 00:45:44.070
It's kind of expected that your
service men and women aren't

00:45:44.070 --> 00:45:46.500
going to go on and post their
opinions politically, right?

00:45:46.500 --> 00:45:47.940
ROB O'NEILL: Mm hmm.

00:45:47.940 --> 00:45:50.670
SPEAKER: Have you ever seen
issues with certain troops

00:45:50.670 --> 00:45:51.640
being too active?

00:45:51.640 --> 00:45:51.960
ROB O'NEILL: Yeah.

00:45:51.960 --> 00:45:52.470
There has been.

00:45:52.470 --> 00:45:54.261
People have been
reprimanded and kicked out

00:45:54.261 --> 00:45:56.430
for a lot of social media stuff.

00:45:56.430 --> 00:45:58.740
Even SEALs get in
trouble for writing books

00:45:58.740 --> 00:46:01.840
as they're still in the
military, trying to get their--

00:46:01.840 --> 00:46:03.300
and again, the
social media stuff,

00:46:03.300 --> 00:46:04.650
it makes the world smaller.

00:46:04.650 --> 00:46:07.860
But yeah, people do get
in trouble for that.

00:46:07.860 --> 00:46:11.299
It's a fine line because
yes, they're soldiers,

00:46:11.299 --> 00:46:12.090
but they're people.

00:46:12.090 --> 00:46:14.310
It's not like a video game
where all of a sudden you

00:46:14.310 --> 00:46:16.089
have these cool guys
that are doing this.

00:46:16.089 --> 00:46:17.130
They came from somewhere.

00:46:17.130 --> 00:46:18.464
They have their views.

00:46:18.464 --> 00:46:20.880
They grew up in a certain
place, went to a certain school,

00:46:20.880 --> 00:46:21.330
and now they're here.

00:46:21.330 --> 00:46:22.210
And they will have
their beliefs.

00:46:22.210 --> 00:46:24.168
So they do get in trouble
for a lot of it, too.

00:46:24.168 --> 00:46:26.459
And that's a tough one.

00:46:26.459 --> 00:46:29.000
SPEAKER: So on behalf of Google,
thanks, Rob, for coming out.

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:30.083
ROB O'NEILL: Thanks, Josh.

00:46:30.083 --> 00:46:32.350
[APPLAUSE]
