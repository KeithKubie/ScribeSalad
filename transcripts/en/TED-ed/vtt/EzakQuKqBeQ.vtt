00:00:13.798 --> 00:00:14.820
I would like to introduce you

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.553
to one of the most amazing scientists

00:00:16.553 --> 00:00:18.066
who have ever lived.

00:00:18.066 --> 00:00:20.082
So famous, that more places on Earth

00:00:20.082 --> 00:00:23.135
have been named after him than any human being.

00:00:23.135 --> 00:00:25.136
So famous, that President Thomas Jefferson

00:00:25.136 --> 00:00:27.924
said he was the most important scientist he ever met.

00:00:27.924 --> 00:00:32.011
And Simon Bolivar called him the true discoverer of South America.

00:00:32.011 --> 00:00:33.720
On the 100th anniversary of his birth,

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.358
every story on the front page of &lt;i&gt;The New York Times&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:36.358 --> 00:00:38.061
was written about him.

00:00:38.061 --> 00:00:39.171
Who is this scientist

00:00:39.171 --> 00:00:42.127
and what did he do that was so extraordinary?

00:00:42.127 --> 00:00:44.748
His name is Alexander Von Humboldt.

00:00:44.748 --> 00:00:45.656
Never heard of him?

00:00:45.656 --> 00:00:47.079
Most people haven't.

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:49.324
His name has been lost in history,

00:00:49.324 --> 00:00:51.082
but here is what he did.

00:00:51.082 --> 00:00:54.454
Alexander Von Humboldt started as a practicing geologist,

00:00:54.454 --> 00:00:57.539
but when an inheritance allowed him the freedom to travel,

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.426
he began an incredible, five-year scientific journey

00:01:00.426 --> 00:01:01.518
through South America,

00:01:01.518 --> 00:01:02.396
Mexico,

00:01:02.396 --> 00:01:03.852
and Cuba.

00:01:03.852 --> 00:01:06.056
From 1799 to 1804,

00:01:06.056 --> 00:01:09.399
Von Humboldt and his botonist partner, Aime Bonpland,

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:11.586
traveled through the jungles of Venezuela,

00:01:11.586 --> 00:01:13.441
made detailed drawings of Inca ruins

00:01:13.441 --> 00:01:15.456
while exploring the mountains of Peru,

00:01:15.456 --> 00:01:18.284
and traversed the breadth of Mexico and Cuba.

00:01:18.284 --> 00:01:21.857
He explored the length of the Orinoco River in Venezuela.

00:01:21.857 --> 00:01:24.022
This 1700 mile portion of the trip

00:01:24.022 --> 00:01:27.991
was filled with danger, disease, and fantastic new discoveries.

00:01:27.991 --> 00:01:30.380
For example, Von Humboldt was the first explorer

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.342
to witness the preparation of the curare plant for poison arrows.

00:01:34.342 --> 00:01:36.703
He recognized the importance of the cinchona tree,

00:01:36.703 --> 00:01:38.486
whose bark contains quinine,

00:01:38.486 --> 00:01:40.081
which is a malaria cure,

00:01:40.081 --> 00:01:41.726
and discovered the ocean current,

00:01:41.726 --> 00:01:44.168
which limits rainfall on the coast of Peru,

00:01:44.168 --> 00:01:46.277
later named the Humboldt Current.

00:01:46.277 --> 00:01:49.611
He discovered and described many new species of plants and animals,

00:01:49.611 --> 00:01:51.367
including the electric eel.

00:01:51.367 --> 00:01:54.911
In Ecuador, he climbed the one of the highest volcanoes, Chimborazo,

00:01:54.911 --> 00:01:56.691
so that he could record air pressure,

00:01:56.691 --> 00:01:59.950
something no one had ever done at this altitude.

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.998
The entire journey covered over 24,000 miles,

00:02:02.998 --> 00:02:06.710
the same distance as the circumference of the Earth.

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.737
Along the way, he took measurements

00:02:08.737 --> 00:02:10.079
about the shape of the land,

00:02:10.079 --> 00:02:11.173
its temperature,

00:02:11.173 --> 00:02:12.047
the air pressure,

00:02:12.047 --> 00:02:14.290
and the strength of magnetic fields.

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.521
By connecting places of identical temperatures,

00:02:16.521 --> 00:02:20.132
he created contour maps with lines of similar temperatures,

00:02:20.132 --> 00:02:22.136
which he called "isotherms".

00:02:22.136 --> 00:02:23.801
Because Humboldt invented these maps,

00:02:23.801 --> 00:02:26.230
scientists began to see patterns

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:27.253
in the life

00:02:27.253 --> 00:02:28.521
and the types of life

00:02:28.521 --> 00:02:30.077
present in certain places,

00:02:30.077 --> 00:02:31.238
and he became a pioneer

00:02:31.238 --> 00:02:34.740
in the visual presentation of scientific data.

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:36.778
These discoveries and measurements were critical

00:02:36.778 --> 00:02:39.528
to what made him such an important scientist.

00:02:39.528 --> 00:02:42.813
Until Humboldt, scientists who described new plants and animals

00:02:42.813 --> 00:02:45.712
did not clearly see the crucial connection

00:02:45.712 --> 00:02:47.000
between living things

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.518
and the places in which they lived,

00:02:48.518 --> 00:02:50.139
called habitats.

00:02:50.139 --> 00:02:52.390
They did not appreciate the role of the environment

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.503
on the diversity of life.

00:02:54.503 --> 00:02:56.670
Humboldt discovered and understood the importance

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.105
of these connections.

00:02:58.105 --> 00:02:58.796
Because of this,

00:02:58.796 --> 00:03:01.641
he is considered the founder of biogeography.

00:03:01.641 --> 00:03:04.496
He also developed a theory called the "Unity of Nature,"

00:03:04.496 --> 00:03:07.352
which shows the interconnectedness of all nature.

00:03:07.352 --> 00:03:08.759
This knowledge plays a vital role

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:11.753
in the preservation and protection of our habitat.

00:03:11.753 --> 00:03:13.799
His book, &lt;i&gt;Cosmos&lt;/i&gt;, describes this theory

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:16.433
and is still in print today.

00:03:16.433 --> 00:03:18.450
As celebrated a scientist as he was,

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.412
Von Humboldt was also generous,

00:03:20.412 --> 00:03:23.027
thus serving another role in the world.

00:03:23.027 --> 00:03:25.496
He was the mentor and teacher to younger scientists.

00:03:25.496 --> 00:03:27.580
In fact, just recently it was discovered

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:29.963
the crucial role that Humboldt played in the work

00:03:29.963 --> 00:03:31.907
of his most famous pen-pal,

00:03:31.907 --> 00:03:33.460
Charles Darwin.

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:35.400
A young Darwin read Humboldt extensively

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.847
and wrote in his diary while on the Beagle,

00:03:37.847 --> 00:03:40.556
"I am at present fit only to read Humboldt.

00:03:40.556 --> 00:03:44.262
He, like another sun, illuminates everything I behold."

00:03:44.262 --> 00:03:46.554
Today, although Humboldt is known and revered

00:03:46.554 --> 00:03:48.539
by a small community of scientists,

00:03:48.539 --> 00:03:51.323
he is almost totally forgotten by many of us.

00:03:51.323 --> 00:03:53.560
Alexander Von Humboldt's influence is apparent

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.105
everywhere and in every scientific discipline.

00:03:56.105 --> 00:04:00.238
He is, perhaps, the most important forgotten man of science.

00:04:00.238 --> 00:04:01.772
But he doesn't have to be,

00:04:01.772 --> 00:04:03.397
because if you remember him,

00:04:03.397 --> 00:04:06.350
perhaps his influence will be celebrated.
