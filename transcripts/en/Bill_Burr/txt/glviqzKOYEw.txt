Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn. It's time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday, January 29th, 2018 what's going on out? Why? Yeah. Um, all right. Well this was a board, this would have been a boring Sunday because there was, you know, there's no football, right? They got the, uh, you got the week off in between the, between the Superbowl and the championship games. They had the pro bowl today, which was kind of cool. Look like football in the future where they would get, you know, they'd start to tackle somebody and they're like, all right. All right. Right, right, right. You know, I don't know if that's the concussion thing or the me too. I don't know what it is. He does not want you touching him. Do not throw into the ground. I have a special guest to liven up my Sunday day. Uh, uh, Jesus who?

Speaker 1:          00:00:50       One and only 200 rigs for Christ's sake. Todd, you all one of my favorite fucking people in this business and you will, one of my favorite comedians. So Isabelle, pleasure through, I feel that the feeling's mutual manager. You don't have to compliment me on this idols, man. Dude, you are. You are the silliest fucking dude. You make me feel mature. That's what I like about you, Todd. Rex, okay. Yes. Todd Rex, who checks off a lot of boxes in this day of caring. That's right. You do. I don't even know that, man. I don't even know what it means either. I'm just trying to be progressive. You would think that somebody would come his fucking way and finally tap the magic wand in his head and make something happen and say, Todd, you've been destroying at least three times as hard as 10 times of the fucking, or whatever the math is.

Speaker 1:          00:01:36       All the fucking comics out there. I love working with you, but I hate following you. You fucking murder. Finally, this fucking asshole. He got himself a special that he's taping and he needs some people to come down and then you can, you know, go on and I can open for, for making you sweat a little lit. No, no, not a chance. All right. He's going to be at the satellite theater in silver lake. Uh, the satellite la.com for tickets. That's right. Uh, February 11th, uh, you're going to be the one in the show. It's a Sunday, but usually come out David support the all right. Sunday, which is a week after, uh, the Superbowl, right? So everybody knows the seven 30 and nine 32 shows, two shows, two shows to show. So you're going to go out there. You fucking, you knocked the first one out. Ego.

Speaker 1:          00:02:25       All right, I got it. And then the next one, you just go off Cruze. Is that what you do? And you do yours, the button. The first one is tightened up and then I spend the whole night trying to forget that I'm taping one real and stop trying to think like, oh my God, I missed that tag. Fuck. That needed to be documented in the comedy universe. I just try to look at it like, all right, this is just, I'm just documenting where my hour was on this night and this is how it came up. And I want you to do that because every night when you go up there, I don't know about you, but I mean I'm constantly fucking up jokes, uh, constantly leaving shit out and then adds to something else. And I never think of it. Never think about it. Like I never thought to get you a glass of water before you sat here for a fucking hour.

Speaker 1:          00:03:10       What an idiot. I'm going to have to hit pause here in a minute, but no good. Um, that's just how, uh, I had to do it that way just because I wanted to think about your, I wanted to ask you about your thought process cause I was curious. Um, like I know the night before I'm going to be a wreck, you know, just was thinking about it and make it all the funny guys. Worry hacks, don't worry. Packs are already fucking working on their next happy hour. Yeah. They'd not even fucking nervous to just, and they'll go off stage with this shitty material, be like, dude, I fucking crushed, crushed in every funny guys. Like, who's it? Good. I'm terrible. I do that every, every time. I just really in a about way compliment to myself. I know him. Um, I, you know, I got to waste to go people, I don't know if she's to you, what did they be obese?

Speaker 1:          00:03:53       Um, yeah, so I I uh, someone told me, I think Louis Ck told me, and I think he heard this from fucking bill Cosby. How funny is that? Um, that your dad, uh, you work this hard to get there? Um, uh, don't forget to have fun, right? So make sure, yeah. Cause if you haven't fun, that's going to be, you're going to feel better about it afterwards, right? If you're someone who nitpicks set himself, there's no way you're going to be happy at the end of it. So just be forgiving. Just be the fucking silly fucking hilarious guy. You all, you'll be fine. Yeah. I'm not really too worried about it, but I just want to make sure that I already can tell you, worry about it. You seem you seem tighter than usual. She's still, I'm doing your podcast. It's kind of a big deal for me too.

Speaker 1:          00:04:36       I feel like I didn't the whole thing. Now that you've peeked behind the curtain. It's just me with a fucking $99 mixer from gutsiness Ana. We're sitting here on the couch like Ernie and Bert, the all I did to prepare for you as I turned on the AC and I scored some for breeze. That's it. I know everybody has these fancy fucking studios. I just did a, I did your mom's house, uh, with a Thompson Sigora and Chrisia presents key. I just did theirs and they have this whole fucking studio. Rogan has like literally like a stern level studio. She's and um, I should step it up at some point. Yeah. But your house is dope. I don't know. No one can see it, but your house is dope. Oh, thank you. It wasn't when I bought it, but now that I've dumped all this money into it and I could never get my money back.

Speaker 1:          00:05:25       Yeah, this is pretty good. I I, this house was like almost a hundred years old when I got it. Almost 90 years old. I should say. People live in here before though, right? Uh, yeah. I don't want to talk about that though because then people will fucking figure out where I live. I already have to fucking edit out one of the comments you made earlier that will fuck two people that fucking lunatics and that's what they do. I'll tell you later just it was just enough of something to make some psycho just turn around and face speaker and start writing down information. But I'm a paranoid dude. Um, yeah. Anyways. Um, what was I talking about? What the fuck we just talking about my add, I don't know either. I have no idea. You've been watching any hockey. Did you see my Sean's elbow? I was a thing of beauty.

Speaker 1:          00:06:09       It was a thing. It was so, it was perfect. Filthy. He, he's, he got trips. I know a, he's the size of Barney rubble, so nobody paid. He's not going to get called out like all foods. Probably one of the worst. But dude, he was and I loved Marshawn and I loved the fucking bruise, but I love him commodities. But at that, the thing is, I don't like that aspect, like throwing that shit. Did you see when, uh, I also and destroyed them. Oh Dude, my God. Ugh, that was a brutal hit. Oh, I thought he had like internal bleeding after that cause he kept, he kept skating but he kept skating. Yeah. And he was just going like, ah. And it seemed like beyond the way, the thing about PK, well, I'm so glad he placed her in Nashville, not from Montreal anymore. It was, he used as best as he used to.

Speaker 1:          00:06:55       He used to get us all the time and everybody knew that was his move. And I don't know why no one, because he just knew exactly when your head was down for a second, it was two crossovers. He was inside and then all of a sudden he was just in front of you and he just ended your fucking life for like, I dunno, like two shifts, but um, yeah, I'm, I'm, uh, I always liked that guy. I never take it to the, to the point if there's a guy on a team that I don't like, you know, like when Derek Jeter played for the Yankees, I couldn't, I couldn't get myself to, to get to the point of like actual g hating them. It's like the guy's great. Right? It is good. Yeah. I'll you saying is, I wish this guy was on my tape.

Speaker 1:          00:07:37       No, you haven't watched his hockey watching my son play hockey. He's a beast. Of course. I know you showed me all the, uh, the video of them and he like picked it up and to see who's like playing drums or something. Right. They also plays the Romans and he plays drums. Any place hockey Jesus kids can be crushing if were to get more legs than I am. You can be a fucking grandfather by the time this special comes out. Jeez. Where you've been working to a lens as a, I just flew back today from Phoenix. I was with Craig, Craig Robinson. You know, I've been totally on them for like a couple of years now when he's not shooting television shows, which is all the fucking time that guy works. Um, so yeah. Uh, where were you guys working? We were working at stand up live in Phoenix. Oh, okay.

Speaker 1:          00:08:20       I know that plays five sold out shows. It was fantastic. Had a ball. I did the uh, you know, it's fucking, that's fucking nuts as far as like that downtown area, how lively it is if there's something going on. But the second, the workday ends like during the week if you're there, like at five o'clock town. Yeah. It's fucking creepy. If the sons don't have a game, it's over. Yeah. I love it though. I mean, I couldn't live there, I don't think, but I had a really good time there. Um, I had a good time traveling with you though. We went down south. I was just like reading some comments about, give me the keys. Just give us the keys. Oh yeah, yeah. That lady. I thought about that the other day. We went to check in that hotel and that lady was just fucking with the instructions.

Speaker 1:          00:09:01       I, Jim is on the fourth floor. It's open from nine to nine. We did as a continental breakfast, blah, blah, blah, blah. And like, I'm sitting there going like, oh my God, how long is this going to take? And she's in the middle of eating. You just choose the key. She got like offended. She goes bad for real dude. I fucking was laughing like I was in high school, man. It was one of those labs. So I was just like, oh. Cause what it was was the fact that she didn't find it funny. It was already hilarious, but the fact that she didn't find it funny, it hurt her feelings. She didn't have to deal with it. And then she got mad all in like, fucking like a half a second. Then I felt like I was in class again where it's like, oh my God, don't start fucking laughing.

Speaker 1:          00:09:43       Or you're gonna, you're gonna get like the tension or something that you also took me to that, that fucking, uh, was at that barbecue place or something. Oh yeah. What does it call it? Was it? They'll say the name of it cause it was terrible. Well the first one we went through, then we went to, we went to them, we went to that one where it was a giant fucking place and they had like 40 fried murdered chickens that you could see. You don't remember that place? It was gigantic and got all my God, this place is fucking unbelievable. Is that the place where you ate? And then we went to the, to the Nascar track and then you were like t rex that you had a salad. Oh where was that? In a hotel in Charlotte. That was Charlotte. Okay. And we did the Nascar experience.

Speaker 1:          00:10:27       That was very cool though. So let's talk about crushing it. That dude was driving us around. Is 20 years old named Dylan. Remember that? I know any as much as the jockey. Right. Cause he doesn't want to slow the car down. I couldn't believe what like what a piece of shit or race car it looks like when you walk up to it. I've seen formula one cars up close. They look like absolute like it looks like if you stepped on it, the whole thing would fall apart cause all it is, it's just, it's just an engine suspension and tires and everything else is just that the lightest. Did you see the uh, the, the gas pedal was shit. It'll look a stick like bent coat hanger. It's like real would have like if you had like that just the floor thing, whatever that the pedal is to rest your foot on the, if you have that in them, that's the difference between you like I guess winning the race or a coming in like third row because that fucking thing is sitting there with a piece of rubber that's going to win that race.

Speaker 1:          00:11:18       That actually they're um, Nascar's not doing well. It's not, the numbers are down now. And I went to the Daytona 500, they painted the seats like every other seat. Like they had like three colors and they would paint them to make it look like those people in the season. Yeah. Cameras flying by. And you know, used to have it like that was the Minnesota north stars really used to have seats like that and I thought it was cool and now I'm thinking well maybe cause nobody showed up for the game devs and maybe that's why they moved to Dallas. So when I hear all those Minnesota north stars fan still complaining that that team left. I mean if there was people that well there was people there I wouldn't have noticed. Right for right, exactly. You would've been

Speaker 2:          00:11:54       able to see the season on the road. You're skating on thousand lakes there. No. You watched any of the football, was that, do you watch any of the football? I haven't been, I haven't watched any football. The only thing in my life is the Washington Redskins and they're terrible number one on safety from Baltimore hosts. How'd you become a Redskins fan? On and off from silver spring, Maryland, right over the DC line that people are thinking blah. Okay. But my, you know, I had grass and shouldn't my yard and two cars, both parents are, I'm not saying that that's not available in Baltimore. What people think of the wire and the corner where the thing about Baltimore, but that's not where I lived.

Speaker 1:          00:12:28       That's why, cause that's where I met you. I met yet the Baltimore Improv with that fucking debt long. He had walked down like that three quarters of a mile hallway the last mile or whatever. Yeah. That was still worst location ever for a uh, for a, for a fucking comedy club with the club. I was all thrilled. They let me come down there and they asked me if I wanted to close out the Sunday one time because somebody canceled and I was all fucking excited and I drove there from New York City to do it right. And I was like I'm going to get in with the Improv's and I showed up and there was like 10 people there and the owner talk was talking to the broker, never talked to me and then walked out while I was on stage. And I remember being on stage.

Speaker 1:          00:13:10       Like I said, I think I knew when I was on stage cause I was kind of glancing over like, okay well is that at least works at Sonic Burger man. And we didn't have, it's really fucking annoying. I don't know why anybody who ran a club, why the fuck he would ever do that? Because you don't know who's coming down and for all you know, they're going to go on, you know, and do something. The fact that she would, I was driving down from me, he didn't even say thanks. Classic fucking club managers. He fat, big 50 inch fucking waste. You know what I mean? But those slacks, that giant fucking belt.

Speaker 2:          00:13:45       Well, right. That's the Gabardine whatever they're called. What are those flags called? Action slacks.

Speaker 1:          00:13:50       Yeah, the action slacks. The uh, yeah, I ran into a number of those fucking people. That's my big thing though. The shade. Do you know what? I'm turning 50. Turning five zero in [inaudible] 49 in May. You do all right. They're young stuff behind you there. You want to know what the next year you life's going to be like? I, uh, hopefully it's going to be something like yours now, while I've decided that I'm going to, uh, I'm going to fucking get myself that, like, rather than looking at 50 would dread, which I'm really not considering it. I, you know, so many of my friends had fucking died, didn't even make it so, you know, don't recommend DC. Don't tell me he died. I swear to God. No, no, we didn't see did last weekend. Last one. The, he fucking died of what?

Speaker 2:          00:14:38       Um, there was like some Carter cardiac event. One of his friends was like coming from Connecticut and going down to Florida. Hadn't seen Joe in life 15 years. Stopped by his house to then they're going to go to the Improv to watch, uh, Lavelle Crawford. And Joe said he had a headache. I went upstairs. It takes him like aspirin or whatever and like sit on the bed and like laid back and Kroger while his buddy was there that he hadn't seen it. 15 years wash. Yeah. Isn't that crazy? Oh my to that guy had one of my favorite fucking jokes were about the compo. No, the joke he did

Speaker 1:          00:15:08       when he was having unprotected sex with the woman. You know, when it goes on to my thing and I'm doing my things, she goes, chalk, don't you come and me, don't you come and meet Joel job. Goddamn you don't come to me. And he goes, I blocks all that out.

Speaker 3:          00:15:24       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:15:25       Joe was hilarious. I haven't seen him in fucking, I haven't seen him in like 15 years. I was going to be my chairs that now. Ah Jeez. Ah, fuck

Speaker 2:          00:15:38       yeah. What we're getting at that age where people are just dying and say, you know what's really fucked up? Is that what it is? It's behind that. I don't, it's not even like shocking to me anymore. Yeah. We only want to hear it now. I used to be like, oh my God. But I was at my son's hockey game when someone called me and he was like, Yo, Joel, record on those, are you serious? And he was like, yeah, want to know how? And he's like, I don't know. I'll find out. And I was like, all right, call me back. And My, my son talk again. Well I have years ago,

Speaker 1:          00:16:02       what it is, is the first wave that goes is, it's usually a be bad genetics, bad luck or bad diet. And then after that it's like if you had half a bad diet, half bad genetics, just literally like when the grim reapers going to get you. So speaking to that, becoming an a dad at this point, like I was fucking old as I am. I got, you know, I've cut back on the Busan and uh, so I'm, I'm trying to get myself down to my fucking, uh, to my fight and weight and actually maybe get a personally you look fit. Yeah. I I I, I took four months off of booze and then for the last month I've been drinking like lightly, but I don't know, I think I'm just too old now because I took those fucking four months off and now going back to it, just, I get to the next, I drink too and I'm just like banged up the next day. Yup. Um, so, I dunno, I think I'm going to go, I was joking that I'm going to go, I'm going to be like staying in my fifties just to like fucking pilates and yoga and tantric six, try to learn how to come for 40 minutes.

Speaker 1:          00:17:10       That's how a lot of his music is his recorded. A lot of people don't know that it's actually him coming. And the beginning of a synchronicity is that Ed.

Speaker 3:          00:17:20       Whoa, Whoa, whoa.

Speaker 1:          00:17:24       That's him. That's him. They've caught him and I record on favorite quarterback and his wife. Right. For the first 40 minutes. Then the last five minutes he just sings this song and right as he comes that stuff.

Speaker 3:          00:17:39       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:17:40       Gordon, some enough going. So Gordon in there, Jeez. I saw him at a, I saw him at the Hollywood bowl with, um, Emma said Gaylord Perry. It's a pitcher. Who's the guy from genesis that sank? Sledgehammer. Peter Gabriel. [inaudible]. Oh yeah, yeah. They both were fucking awesome. And they had like, and I was like, all right, who's gonna? Who's gonna open, who's going to fucking clothes? And they just, one would sing a song and then the next one come out and sing a song and then they were just both out there and if there was the other person saw and they would just sync back up early. Oh yeah, that's still Peter Gabriel had like synchronized dance moves and shit. It was fucking finish and they were bad. But that was part of the joke when you just see was he didn't give a fuck late. It was like two guys like daughter plays with them too sometimes.

Speaker 1:          00:18:22       Is that right? I was like the violin and she comes out and crosses on the violin. I'm trying to remember if he had a violinist. I just know that he was just like the guy just aged and said fuck it was staying was you know, still in shape and shit. So PT gator look terrible now. Oh Dude. He came out looking like, you know that headliner that didn't make it. If just doesn't give a fuck anymore. It comes out with like where I like, oh, the same sweatsuit he was wearing. When you pick them up at the airport, just walks on stage, maybe put a hat on.

Speaker 1:          00:18:51       He had a be in a big ones that you on. Staying always has one of those fucking those clothes that looks like he's going to do a, what does that movie did with the Tina Turner where she shaved the side of her head? Oh my. Um, Thunderdome. Thunderdome. I feel like he got a bunch of clothes from that movie that still fed them. He still has a trailer, the wardrobe trailer, all that Mesh. Spiderman looking shit, flashy underwear peeking out of the back. Shane Shane Bell shirt. Yeah, I saw those guys. They fucking, they absolutely killed it here. I got to make shit. What, 20 minutes then at some point I do have to read a little to advertising, but I'm do who's your fucking Internet provider? T and t minus just, it's just not happening for me. Yeah, I think I might, I don't even know who I have.

Speaker 1:          00:19:40       Nia handles that and it's, it's just been on the Fritz. I gotta drive the Fritz. It's been on the Fritz. I've got to drive over to Starbucks. Buy something. Starbucks. I don't drink coffee. All right. I mean I guess they, the coffee has to be amazing maternity line. Strong as it is. You don't need to be Katherine. Oh, you know, I don't know. Worst wired as well. I'm the worst dude. I, I need like the reverse of that. But you go into all of that food just sucks all of their food just fucking sucks. All right, let me, let me read a little advertising here. Um, how much, how much has been done, how much time are you going to do when you special? I'm doing an hour hour that's doing it now. Maybe a little longer so we can cut it down. All I do is a little long.

Speaker 1:          00:20:24       I would do like whatever you you want it to be. I would only do a little bit more than that. Yeah, cause yeah, it makes it to your life so much easier. If you, if you want to do an hour special, do like an hour and 10 are, then you usually just lift a bit. Or to the same guys that are shooting want special shot only Adams special that he's uh, they said that, uh, the only like an hour and 20 minutes and that they wanted to cut it down to an hour because showtime wasn't buying an hour, 20 minutes specials. They're just buying ours. Then you've got a set of killing your babies. That's the doors. But he refused to cut it and so they just took it out in an hour and 20. So if you watch the special that's on right now, that's on showtime right now. It's an hour and 20 minutes. Jesus only yams telling the business which way it's going. Wow. Call this. I would've been like, all right, I'll cut it down. All right. Oh, look, all the sip.

I knew in nine months, but I was just like, I don't know. Right. And then also my wife was a little bit of a commitment. Phobe we're both like commitment phobes yet totally relationship people. So it totally worked. You know what I mean? Right. So we lived there, our whole sid and Nancy fucking lifestyle for awhile, you know, not married, no kids. Partying had a great time. We did that for awhile to hit all the water parks, the magic t shirts. Oh yeah. Matching me undies.

Speaker 2:          00:27:03       Uh, it took me forever to propose to her, but I'll tell you why, why it happened. I went out partying with friends of mine one night and I ended up spending an ad out in Virginia and I was on my way back the next day, like 10:00 AM. And my wife was furious. She was my girlfriend at the time. We were living together and she was furious and she called me. She already left me a message and I checked the message and then she called me again when we were driving home. I don't know. And so when I picked up the phone and said, hey, I was just was out here thinking with my friends. The reason I was like, I'm out here with my friends that spread the night that it's like I was talking to a man, I think, uh, I think I'm ready to settle down and marry you.

Speaker 1:          00:27:35       Wow. That was in that way. She, that you had to come up with that she know that she better condition. She will now when she listens to this Nellie way. Oh Dude, I want to get you in trouble. So what does she do? What's that? She was like, really? Oh my God, I can't wait for you to come home. And I was like,

Speaker 2:          00:27:52       dude, I didn't want to have a fight what I at home for, for spending the night out. So yeah, so that defused the whole fight. Then it was coming up

Speaker 1:          00:27:59       and set you up for another thousand more in the next year there. Um, I, I just want to fuck did I do? And I finally just realized, uh, yeah. I just knew she was going to leave Sundays off the pot. No, it was some days when I was mad at her. I would fantasize about breaking up, but even in the fantasy of her breaking up when she would walk out, even in the fantasy of that, I would still go, no, no, no, no, no. That sounds like all right. I got to make, oh yeah, that's, that's, that was the, Paul Versey helped me get through that. Poverty has actually helped a number of comedians get over that. Like, uh, that's, that's thing, you know, you think it's a mountainous, you just stepping up on the curb, which just like, dude, where are you going? Right. Or do you know she's going to be so happy. You're going to be happy once you get through the fucking vows and all of that bullshit. Then you just said a party with all your friends and is fucking great. He was, he was 100% 100% fucking right. So, um, I was going to ask you, do you guys go out on Valentine's Day? No, we don't really sell celebrating.

Speaker 2:          00:29:07       Like what? I'm going to chocolate. There's nothing like that or cards, you know, we might know we have the kids, so a lot of the times we're just a, we'll wait till the kids go to sleep and then we'll have a bottle of wine and watch a movie or some downstairs, some corny like that. And that's way better. We're going to go an hour and go out to dinner. Like, dude, we're so old now. Sometimes it feels like a, we want to go out and have a good time. So we're gonna like, we're gonna go out to dinner and then go into Hollywood and get some drinks and maybe go to a dance club or whatever that by the time we're done eating dinner, like you just go home. Uh, and it's, how psyched are you on the other person says that? Yeah, this is like, yes, yes, I do. Just want to go. I don't want to go to Hollywood right now. Yeah. Like I,

Speaker 1:          00:29:42       I for years would rather drink at home. I got better stuff here. Then they got out at the bar. They always have some shit stuff in the rape. You all the praise also. Yeah. And once you're with the person you're going to be with that they got the worst booze. I'm not interested in meeting anybody. Right. So all I'm going to do is go out there and then I've got to deal with like how am I getting fucking home? This is before like Uber and all that Shit. I've been, I've been drinking at home the for for years. [inaudible] have some like, yeah, we have what? Bourbon. Bourbon whiskeys. Scott. I think Tequila. Yeah, there's really smokey, I think whiskey. One time I was here that was probably a scotch. Scotch. It was like, yeah, it wasn't good. Yeah, it was good. Oh, did we smoke cigars? Uh, oh no, no.

Speaker 1:          00:30:27       I don't think we did because as I was thinking, my daughter just had her first birthday and I was looking at the house. And to do that, we had like 16 kids over here. Really all, I have friends who have kids now cause you know, once you have a kid, all your friends who don't have kids, it's just like they keep live in their rock star life and you're like, you just, you get like six more calls. Like Ah, you got gotta watch the kid and he gets the gist. You just fade out and started. Yet they start disappearing. Horizon, you just fade out. Uh, like that bad member who's on the first album and he goes like, what am I fucking half that can happen. Then they, then, you know, they never see that guy until like the VH one behind the music. He's just like, why am I, you know, they're putting out a second album and they just didn't have a call me and all of a sudden I was just like, we're like, get them out.

Speaker 1:          00:31:10       Um, yes. So I was looking around the living room and we had like, like 16 little kids in there. Oh my goodness. Agency encounter. Yeah. And just like toys Galore and just shit all over the place. And I was just looking, thinking like, you know, 18 months ago this would have been five of my friends. We would have been getting shit faced watching a game and smoking cigars and just how like how much it changes in a good way. Like we went to the, went to the park today for the first time I went over, I put her on the swing and shit. She loved it. Oh yes. Squeeze means the greatest. See all your pictures and video of that man because of high, Nelson goes by so fast and you'll look back at those pictures with a tear in your eye. Oh I know I'm already doing it.

Speaker 1:          00:31:52       I'm already like this a part of me that's like uh, uh as psyched as I am to be a dad there, there was a mild depression with her turning one going like ah, she's not a baby anymore man. She's a Todd. The next year she turns to her age doubled in a year. Yeah she's helped. But I see why people keep having babies cause you just want to keep hitting reset row cause it's so fucking awesome. And I like talking in a positive way about it because when my wife got pregnant, just so many people said all this negative shit and they all do yo know boys Lincoln, it's over for you. Yeah, no more getting a little coozie plus no more go into Thailand and see what's up over there. Like all this degenerate shit. And I was just like, yeah, this is way better than that shit though.

Speaker 1:          00:32:36       Yes. Now today we were over there and was just uh, I was having the best time and I I, you know, it was yeah, it was quite good. Clean Fun is actually getting a little bit of exercise right. Um, clean and, and, and she kind of took her first step in the park, which was cool. And uh, so yeah, so now we figured out what the motivation tactic was to get it going. Dude. I see you have to tell you what's fucked up though was Imani is the definition of organic in the deaf in the dictionary versus the definition of organic within the food industry. Like they literally changed it like with law, what organic means. Cause I know when, when we're giving her like poisonous shit, she's fucking so excited to eat it. Like the real organic, no, no, no, no, no. The shit that they call it organic, but it's really got like fucking this, like, like they try to get you addicted to it, like cigarettes, the same fucking thing.

Speaker 1:          00:33:32       So we had these little puffs that said organic on them and uh, I just noticed that like, we would have like really good food and she would start pointing at the other ones, like a lab rat. And then one time I went to reach, just reached for the can and she started like hopping up like, yeah man, give me a hit. So you should either fix. Yeah. So, um, yeah, we phased those out. I'm actually, that's not true. We have, we have one more canned down, so we're going to wean her off and then it's all, you know, she's a kid so she doesn't see it. She's not going to be thinking of them. But, um, I, that's the thing that's, uh, that can also drive you nuts is, uh, that type of shit. And then if you have any sort of, um, friend with a kid in your life that is totally up on all these issues and then they just, they just come to you. It's like a fucking, it's like this cloud of fear that they just dump on. You go to this website, you have to fucking

Speaker 2:          00:34:27       being a dad and I, we have friends like that or at least a couple in their fucking annoying and it's like, and even though our kid likes their kid, we have to like cut them back a little bit and I'm like, my daughter's like, well when did she come over? And I'm like, if the kid comes over is fine, but I can't have the parents come over here to like, did you get your kids vaccinated?

Speaker 1:          00:34:44       How do you handle that? Because that's what I realize now is that you can have like, you can be friends with people, like a couple of you and your wife are friends with a couple and then all of a sudden, and they have kids but you don't have kids so you're not dealing with them on that level. But then when you have a kid, the relationship changes. Now you not only do you guys have to like get along socially when you go out, you know, you both vibe. You got to kind of on some, they gotta be within your wheelhouse of how they raise their fucking kid. And if the kid comes over and he's a fucking lunatic like bite and a dog and shit like Elon, what? What is this cave man? You got to kind of be like, oh, I don't want my kid acting like that.

Speaker 2:          00:35:21       Right? No, we have a, I'm not saying any names says I don't want to alienate any people that might be listening to this, but we have one family who has a kid that's just fucking rude and I can't have it and I just, I cannot stand. But my, my kid wants this kid to come over and was like, Jesus Christ should we lends this fucking kid come over and then like maybe they changed over the last six months and they come spend the night and it's a fucking nightmare. What are the rules?

Speaker 1:          00:35:47       If a kid comes home and he's rude, like what can you say now to a fucking kid?

Speaker 2:          00:35:53       Did I started just getting serious with it all? I do go back to the bed, go back to bed. So I fucking waking up every 10 minutes of calling for your mommy and then

Speaker 5:          00:36:01       when I say I'm going to call your mommy, there's, you know, no, don't call my mommy. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I'm like, then do, what the fuck are you doing? I don't say fuck no, no, cause I don't know. I'm not going to be linen. Shut the fuck up. You being a fucking asshole.

Speaker 2:          00:36:13       All right, so I'd be a little asshole. Notice that I told my wife. Am I doing, he gets up one more time. I'm not talking to them. You got to talk to them cause I'm going to start getting mad.

Speaker 1:          00:36:22       Do you remember back in the day, like if your friend's Dad said anything, you will fail. You are afraid of us,

Speaker 2:          00:36:28       right? Yeah. Hell yeah. Go back to the room and go to bed. Like, Oh shit, this motherfucker serious

Speaker 5:          00:36:34       and it needs to come down. I hate that they call me by my first name tied. No they don't. Yes I did. Todd. I'm scared. Can you call my mommy? I'm old school. I'm old speech. He had called me Mr. Burke that said let him, he fucked a bill.

Speaker 1:          00:36:51       You got wait, what's to eat here? Right, right. No Dude. I would literally be like, what the fuck did you say to me? You Little Shit. I won't say that, but that's what I'll be thinking. So that of course, as I say, please address me as Mr. Burn the subutex. He will here is, what the fuck did you say to me? You Little Shit. And then he'll say to his mother and yeah, you mean

Speaker 2:          00:37:11       right. Let's walk. A little girl comes over to her house and she was like, she'll come downstairs, I sleep in all morning and then come down with the kids where my wife and I are. My daughter's still asleep and she'll come downstairs before everybody and she be like, what's for breakfast? And my wife was like, well, you know, pancakes and sausage. She was like, yeah, I don't like that stuff. What else is there? And my wife says looks at me and was like, this is a bit serious right now. Like oh the fuck back upstairs.

Speaker 1:          00:37:34       Yeah, what the fuck? Oh my, I would love to hear a kid now and he's saying to my mother, my mother would just be, well that's all there is. I guess. You know I've talked to you at lunch.

Speaker 2:          00:37:43       My wife's a lawyer says, I guess you'll just be hungry then cause that's what we're having. If you're in, if you don't need to just going to be hungry. It's amazing how like some of these kids are rude to sit and you say something to the parents were like, yeah, she's a little crazy. She, she's, she's like, no,

Speaker 1:          00:37:57       now that's, that's like when people have a dog that's fucking nuts. Like I did, but I, I quarantine the thing when people would come over except one time I got a little confident and watch to me the dog whisperers and then my friend end up getting bit j law had got bit by a dog. Yeah. Bit of on his calf given nip. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:38:14       yeah, that dog scared the living shit out of me. One time we were downstairs and there she was in a cage. Oh yeah. That doesn't know that she was in there. And I was like walking past

Speaker 5:          00:38:22       and like went out the case with the battle of the cage and scare the fucking Piss island all point. God Yvette Cage, I'll be shredded right now. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:38:30       Yeah. She was an adorable Hell Hound. She loved the hell out of me and about six people and everybody else. She treated as a fucking intruder. And, uh, I just, you know, it was the smartest, most painful, uh, decision I ever made, but I didn't understand, uh, that I was still going, I guess are, you know, the last two days in a row she's in town, uh, like you've kinda still take care of her in a way, right? Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah, definitely. And I get pictures of her all the time and when, like once every two months she'll come to town and I just take for, for a hike every single day like this. You remember, you're like, Yup. Anyway, she did and she does. She does. And uh, if, when I, when I go out to where the guy lives, if I show up, she's kind of looked cause she's not used to seeing me down.

Speaker 1:          00:39:20       You know, first they see the shape and it's the smell like the whole way that dog brainworks or whatever. Right. And then, um, then, you know, then she's all back to normal and everything. But I got to, I was nervous meeting her because of the way she was because I knew at that point she had bonded with the new person and it might view me as like a threat. I mean the dog was like through that dog. It, my buddy said that there, uh, as Cleo Ferzli yeah, verse he goes to, this should be a 30 for 30 on that dog, that dog's life. Like how it was abandoned by the La River. I mean, so many times this thing should've just been like, you know, like whenever the Olympics come around, they always have like those crazy stories that make you tear up all the shit that they went through.

Speaker 1:          00:39:58       Like, you could do that other yeah. And like as a pitbull be in that big of a pain in the ass like that, those things, if those things sneeze, they get put down, it's fucking terrible. But, um, the fact that she still like living this awesome life, uh, makes me feel good. And every time I see her, like, um, you know, the dude had gotten, it was my former trainer, so, uh, and he, he just like, she has her first dog friend now. Every dog, she tried to murder, now she's like friends with the dog, but like they, they needed like his level talent like is he says jokingly said, yeah, I'm, I've, I've been slow cooking or she's not someone that you like, okay, this is how it is. And then boom to that, it's just been this year long thing that she's now finally ready to just, and even when he started hanging, she started hanging out with another dog.

Speaker 1:          00:40:44       There was this whole fucking process that he had to go through and totally keep an eye on my dog because my dog does this shit where like when she's going to attack, she's in the cage. Wow. She did that shit, but she was out in the open. Um, she just made the decision. There was no growling, there was no warnings going right. She just did it. She just, she had, she would just fucking do it. Let me read 'em let me read some of the questions here. All right. Um, taught by the way, you're gonna. You're gonna fucking, I can already tell, Dude, you're already wound up about this thing. You're going to fucking murder, dude. Thank you there.

Speaker 5:          00:41:19       I'm excited about it. I really am. I feel like this is like, you know, I've been doing this shit for so long and I'm at the age right now. Like, if it doesn't fucking pop for me right now, it's not going to fucking happen.

Speaker 1:          00:41:27       Nah, that's, that's the old dude. That's the old way of thinking. You're totally in control. I do this business like it's a giant mall. Okay. And I have my little store in the mall and you walk into my store, hey, why don't I tell jokes? I do a podcast. Got a cartoon, see anything you like. That's what I'm selling. If you don't fucking like it, I get it. See you later. But when I first got into this business, I would, you know, it's like you're walking around the mall. Oh my God. This selling shirts. I gotta sell shirts. Oh Fuck Day. They got sneakers. I've gotta be doing. You try to like do everything with the Joneses. Right. Fuck that too. Just by the way, your cartoon is fucking hilarious. I'll thank you. Frank Murphy and a vicar. Motu Vera guys. Oh yeah. You wait till the UHC, you wait for the third season where we're editing, editing like fades.

Speaker 1:          00:42:17       It's going to be out later on this year. I'm not allowed to say exactly when. I don't have an exact date either. But like Netflix has like, you know, they like the fucking geniuses of this new thing is they, they, I remember the last time like, well last time, uh, when I had a special coming out there, they wanted me to come in to meet with them to like talk about, discuss promoting it. And I'm thinking like, what the fuck are we going to discus? Throw up a couple of billboards. I'll talk about my podcast. Dude. I went in there, it was like bill Belicheck shit until, I can't even, I can't even explain it. Like I went in there going like, this is ridiculous that this is just an idiot like me with a bunch of Dick Jokes. And then I just, I, I watched them breaking down to how they were going go up promoting it.

Speaker 1:          00:43:01       Like two people who are watching Netflix and their fucking algorithm and all of that shit judged by what you watched and all that shit. And not saying it's a perfect system. It, it blew my mind. Just fucking blew my mind. They didn't listen. Dude. There's a reason why they're global right now. Um, and it's not from hanging out with me there. All right. A peach cobbler recipe. Hey Billy Cross king. I like to bake by the way. Yeah. I mean my daughter told me that before I made my daughter a birthday cake. I'm doing that every year of a life's easy. Are you doing the non GMO with the no. Gluten, the non tasty for us. Oh No. There was a bunch of sugar and fucking nice stuff on talking dead baby seals in it.

Speaker 1:          00:43:42       That's a big politically incorrect cake. Um, alright. Deliberately crest king. I am invited to a super bowl party by the way. You know the Patriots are in it again this year. Do you realize if Tom Brady gets another ring? Jesus, Chris, him and bill Belicheck we'll have more rings than every franchise in the NFL except for the Pittsburgh Steelers. There'll be tied. Wow. Then their entire 50 years, 50 something years of every franchise trying to win one at Brady doesn't lose though. I'll just let you know that right now. Yeah, he does. He lost twice to the giants. I think this is going to be, it's just give him the ring. No, no, no, no, no. That talk makes me nervous through the eagles. The Eagles got a fucking horrific horrifically terrifying fucking running game. And uh, nick folds is not a backup quarterback that as a starting quarterback who lost his fucking job and he's coming back like a fucking revenge movie.

Speaker 1:          00:44:33       That defense looks, looks fucking great row. And I don't think we would have done to the vikings what they did. So yeah, I dunno. I would say take the, trying to be humbled and to keep the gods happy. Take the eagles and the points. That's what, that's what I would do with my mind. I'm not doing Edelman's out. Gronk got a concussion. Um, Ammon Dola had the game of his fucking life. Did you get that song? The Hammond Dola Song? Ah, it's like that song, Lola. Really? Oh Dude. It's fucking go. D O l a doe now that play a nick fold and the super bowl as far as it may not show old. Alright. Hey Billy. Chris King. I'm invited to a Superbowl party. Don't worry. Just dude's and nobody interested in commercials or half time shows. Thank God. And I am the designated dessert maker.

Speaker 1:          00:45:27       Uh, you are talking about peach cobbler on a Monday morning podcast, but I can't quite remember if it was a recent one or an old one. Anyway, would you mind sharing your recipe with me? Because I want to have the real deal. I'm from Germany and can't figure out if the recipes I find here any good hope to hear from you and go fuck yourself. I just googled and looked at pictures and then I found one that looked good law. This is what I would say. I would say, uh, I would say if the cinnamon, nutmeg, whatever they tell you to fucking put in, add more, cause they always be like an eighth of a teaspoon of court. They're going to make it taste good, but they're not gonna make it taste great. So definitely be tasting you're filling and don't be afraid to get a little light, a little heavy handed with some of the spices, especially the cinnamon sugar.

Speaker 1:          00:46:17       A little bit of some butter in there. And then I give it a little Dustin before I closed the Pi of the, the really? Oh yeah, you got, it's gotta to be a big fucking delicious going mess. Um, that's how I do it too. It, everything's gonna be on fucking baking. I'm trying to get you all right. Political relationship advice. Oh God. Here we go. All right, let me, I want to hear this one. I literally unfollow people on Twitter if all they do is talk politics. Unless you're rationally kind of trash in both sides, but like, you know, it's going to be like, you know, so our Trump just did this. It's just like, all right. I will tell you that. Well, I mean, yeah, I mean, trauma one sided to Conan, Conan O'Brien and the funniest fucking joke about Trump. They go, how do you, uh, Andall the whole trumps that she, what's the hardest part about the Trump situation right now? He goes, he goes trying to write a joke that's more absurd than what's actually happening.

Speaker 1:          00:47:10       I like how we have like Trump on Twitter just is, it's just considered normal now that like a president has the time to, I don't even like people shit on me all the time. I don't even get back to them watching the quote leader of the free world or this is all just, you know, that wasn't a stain on my tie. That was actually a presidential seal. The all right. Political relationship advice. Hey Billy Willy Concoct, I don't know what that means. That's an, you know, one with a little bit of alliteration, uh, to pair love the podcast and of course the stand up. Thank you. You're the only comic that actually makes me bust out laughing. I'll wait. You see Todd special cheese. So I'm a 21 year old guy and I've been seeing this girl now for about nine months. She's great. Treats me good, loyal and is pretty, all of these relationship things that we start off like a horror movie.

Speaker 1:          00:48:04       Well that was all sunshine. Everything. I'm 21 prime of my life. I get darker ship, everything's going great. All right. The main problem I have though is she is a big Democrat, big democratic. It's promise. She's a big democratic and he's a super conservative. Uh, she's black and I'm almost as white as you. Oh God, this is like a fucking bad porno. She gets upset when I post political stuff on Facebook, like pro a pro video of Trump, but yet she posts all this stuff about kneeling for flags and Obama is all that, uh, yeah, dude does this relationship's not going to fucking less. Uh, she wouldn't even talk to me when I wore a Trump shirt. Oh my God. Yeah. It's like, dude, like this is, this is a guy who like sort of saw how the Nazis were baited into running over somebody with a car going, well, you know, there's hatred on both sides. Um, dude, I really wanted to side with you, but you know, this is, this is like astoundingly fucking, like, I respect the fact that you like Trump and all of that shit you want to wear as t shirts, but your confusion that she gets upset is a little fucking weird. Uh, touches me off. But I don't want to ruin the whole relationship over something as dumb as politics that's too late. So since you are already in an interracial relationship and for and for a lot longer than me, period. What's your advice? Question Mark?

Speaker 1:          00:49:37       The lovely mia. It's Nia with an end. Um, can tell me her 2 cents as well, even though she'll just side with the chick. Just kidding. Thanks. And is always go fuck yourself. Ps. Tom Brady's the greatest of all time. Ah Sir. Um, I gotta be honest with you, like if you don't understand why she is upset, um, you'd have to try to put yourself in her position and then read some of this shit and some of his opinions I guess would be the best way to do it. But I'm like, you're not just a conservative if you're were like rocking the t shirt, like you're all in. You know what I mean? Like a, his girlfriend hates when I wear my swastika tee shirts. Not that deep. Do you think that's, it's that bad? I mean he has, he hasn't run like, I'm going to know mean no,

Speaker 5:          00:50:28       but I'm just saying

Speaker 1:          00:50:29       is he like a Trump icy, like a Hitler light?

Speaker 5:          00:50:34       Ie

Speaker 1:          00:50:35       booze would hit Luby was that he's gotta be like Moonshine. So where's Trump Yeager? He's a Yag of body.

Speaker 5:          00:50:46       Like that's shitty. Bourbon goes schlog. Yeah, he's like a Lulu flakes instead of gold flakes. Yeah. Johnny Walker red. And there's, there's no, there's no, yeah, there's no fun.

Speaker 1:          00:50:59       Okay. And uh, got whatever soft drink to fucking mixed with it. What's the worst when you approach this? What's the worst period of ahead? Constantly. Yeah. College age. Ah, Shit.

Speaker 5:          00:51:11       Uh, Milwaukee's best. No. Warren that or natty bow and there was no Bohemian was pretty damn bad. Oh yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:51:18       I always hated was fucking a Bush light. Bush light was like, Bush itself was just, yeah, that was just like, yeah, it was like water. And then they wanted that town we used to eat. I never, you know, something. I never got into Pabst blue ribbon because I resented the hipsters that we're drinking them because it used to be this blue collar beer that all these fucking townies drank. And then all these hipster people were wearing their a flannel shirts. Well you know those shirts for awhile, were they wearing like the gas station shirt that had somebody else's name on it where they actually had to do the fucking job and they funded some thrift shop. Like my fantasy was that they ran into the guy who owned the shirt. They just walked up like, Hey, I'm Jim. You know, it's, oh I just needed a shirt and then he gets the shit kicked out of them. But most of my fantasies are violent. Um, my advice is, uh, to, I don't if get a bunch of empathy. Uh, I don't know. I don't, I don't see this thing working. I just don't see it working. That's going to be like, cause you guys, so if you're that far away from each other, you're not going to get married and have kids. Oh yeah. That's like,

Speaker 5:          00:52:34       yeah, there you'd be fighting over them politically too. Like, so what? They're going to be Democrats or conservatives when they grow up with a refill. That's a whole nother can of worms.

Speaker 1:          00:52:42       Yeah. So enjoy banging her and uh, I would while she lets you while she let you and then I would fucking, yeah, I would just be like, yeah, but he's also 21. He doesn't know. He generally seems like he doesn't understand unless that was just, you know, sometimes people just lie and they writing crazy shit. All right. Girlfriend drinks too much. Uh, dear bill, I was telling me you gotta help me out with the problem I've been having. I've been living with my girlfriend for almost a year now. We are in our mid to late twenties just for some background. Everything's going great except for one thing we worked regular nine to five type jobs, which means most of the fun we have is on the weekend. And like most people, we tend to lube up on the liquor while we're out and about or even just staying in, well, I don't think anything wrong with, with drinking.

Speaker 1:          00:53:26       My girlfriend doesn't know her limits often. She will drink way too much, too early and ended up passing out or throwing up though commonly both will occur. Wow. Yeah. She doesn't know how to drink. You've got to pace yourself out there. A few examples. Uh, she will insist on watching a movie after we've had a few drinks. We finally decide, uh, we'll put it on and then after 15 minutes she passes out. Then I'll have to stop because of course I can't watch it without her. Yeah. What we'll teach her a lesson. Watched the whole movie and be like, you missed a great one and in the end the Butler did it. So lay off the booze cause I'm going to start fucking doing that to you. Um, number two, we went to a hockey game a few weeks ago and when we got to the arena she ordered me a beer and herself to double gin and tonics.

Speaker 1:          00:54:16       Oh my God. She has a promo. We had already had a couple of before arriving. She then proceeded to down both of them in 10 minutes before the puck drop and passed out soon after the hockey game by God. That's the fucking problem. I had to drag her up to stand for the anthem and again when they were honoring the troops. This is fucking, this is like a Kristen Wiig character. Uh, she then left for the washroom. That's been one of my favorite scenes though when she gets fucking wasted on the plane in bridesmaids and she just, when she goes [inaudible] the fuck is, he was walking out, uh, I see. Then left for the washroom, but came back with two more doubled Jen's a hotdog and a bag of popcorn, which she spilled and blamed it on me. Oh my gosh. Sounds like a episode of intervention.

Speaker 1:          00:55:06       Even if I did do it, the first thing you're going to do is snitch on me. All right. That just took a left turn. But, uh, get the fuck out of here. We're supposed to be a team, but I digress. Sorry for the rant. Uh, last weekend. My God, these are all like bullet pointed. By the way, in the Uber ride home she preached, she proceeded to whip out her tit to try and seduce me. I told her to put it away because she was in no condition and I didn't want to fuck up my Uber rating passes out. Wait, what? The passenger gets an Uber Rating. Oh yeah. The radio's too for the drivers. That might actually boosted his rating. The driver will look back and slows, looks sloppy to me.

Speaker 1:          00:55:51       We'd fucking gin and tonic on it. Uh, anyways, I'm gonna fuck up my Uber a pet. She passes out 30 seconds later in pukes in the elevator on the way up to the apartment. It didn't make it a lot. It didn't make a lot of a mess as she was able to hold it back before I got into the toilet. Oh my God. This guy's just truncate the piece de resistance. Uh, she passed out during the bill Burroughs show at the Sony Center. Uh, how do you pass out for that create man who just came in to entertain us? Uh, just a pre face. I had an allergic reaction that morning was toast. Had a little bit of weed before the show and I was able to be fully alert. But yet you are the one that's falling asleep. Jesus Christ. This is like the fucking war and peace. This is like Barfly, uh, saying all this. However, I have to admit that I'm no saint either. I arguably drank much more than she, Ireland would drink much more than she does, but I hold my boobs a little better than she does. I probably made her sound worse than she actually is.

Speaker 5:          00:56:52       You gotta take it all away. That going to go back a little. Now you already begin to look like a drunken mess.

Speaker 1:          00:56:57       Yeah, but in truth, she's a wonderful girlfriend who cooks with math for me. Cleans to me is very beautiful. Well in fucking live happily ever after, which is not three sheets. She's not puking on the sheets and as you can tell, is willing to come to a hockey game with me. And yes, she did buy me bill bird tickets for my birthday. She is a truly amazing person and I planned to marry her someday, but this is just getting out of hand and I want my weekends back. Can you do me a favor and turn that light on my fucking eyes or a shot here? The Sun's going down here. I'm not trying to have a romantic podcast with you. Um, uh, let's see here. I've had conversations with her before and when she, she's sober, she gets it, but it doesn't stop her when she's drunk and she will get angry at me when I tell her she's had enough and I can't stop her from sneaking off to get secret drinks with my money.

Speaker 1:          00:57:51       She feels bad and I honestly feel guilty writing this to you and she is truly amazing. I feel like he wrote the first half and then she walked into the room and is looking over his shoulder. Um, but it's tough not only for me, but I know this is not easy on her, but some to her body sometimes as well. I just wanted her to be all right and for us to be able to have a good, healthy time. I'm not quite sure what to do here. Am I right to tell her that she's got to take it easy, particularly when we go out because it seems to be working. Do I have to set a better example and drink less, if at all? Yeah. I mean, if she's a fucking boots town, maybe, uh, maybe both. Maybe both. Try to, uh, drink a little bit less. She might be one of those people, you know, where once she has a kid, she'll just fucking knock all that shit off. Or

Speaker 5:          00:58:41       Oh God, I could just drive a rover the completely where she just stays hammered all the time.

Speaker 1:          00:58:45       Yeah. You'll have a drunken baby, you know, coming out, fucking stop emailing and Bill Byrd started emailing drew Pinsky it's kid comes out dressed like foster Brooks,

Speaker 5:          00:59:00       um, to do a fucking, I love Boston Brooks run the simulated drunk comedian. Oh yeah. It was fucking hilarious.

Speaker 1:          00:59:09       And He, uh, and he never really drank. Yeah. The way I know he had it down to like do, that's back when like being an alcoholic was like funny, right. This is how, this is how much I have to be careful though is talking about all that drinking made me want to drink. Like I love it. I fucking, I hate how it makes me feel though now. So I kinda, I just lay off

Speaker 2:          00:59:37       Craig. Craig Robinson didn't drink for a year and then we just had drinks and Arizona this past weekend. We felt like trashed both mornings that we drink. Yeah. And so he was like, yeah, I thought I was back after taking a year off. I thought it was back, but I'm good on drinking. I think I was like, yeah man, I don't feel good either. I had a headache every day.

Speaker 1:          00:59:55       It's an age thing. Like it's really, that's a young person thing. Like is it like

Speaker 2:          01:00:00       we had fun. We were down to like we'd do those shows, those theater shows. We would go to like the cigar bars have a drink with cigars.

Speaker 1:          01:00:08       Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, I, I still, I think what I, I'm, I my drinking may be, we'll be, is like a, this year when I go on the road, I think like if I go up for three days, like that Middle Day, yeah. Not the first night because I traveled and not the, not, you know, the night before I have to go to the airport, but just that in the middle one, finding a good place. Um, I dunno if that, that might be the, uh, that might be the way I'll do it. You know what I went to last night? Oh my God, I went to this fucking this eighties, like, uh, all these bands, this crazy fucking lineup was, um, the real bedrooms attributed them. No, it was like tutor was, uh, what was it? Ah, like drama Rama and with them. Holy Shit. I think, I can't remember the song is that flock of Seagulls, the Romantics, they were all really their tone.

Speaker 1:          01:01:01       Loke oh my God. Fucking the violent femmes Melly Mel than the furious five for his phone. Uh, and boy George closed. No Way. It was fucking, it was, that was this, this was at, uh, the Microsoft theater, which used to be the Nokia, me and Nia went down there and, um, I, it was fucking awesome, but I learned a lot about show business watching those p you could tell like who is sick of singing their hits. And it was also like, fuck this, I'm bringing it. And then I also learned, you know, watching, you know, he got to take care of yourself. I have a story about that because I swear to God, Dude, if you see a band that let themselves go, it's like depressing on like yours because you love them and they look like shit. And then all you're thinking is like, oh my God, I'm all, I'm fucking 20 years older than he was when he put that song out a fuck.

Speaker 1:          01:02:02       We're all gonna die. But when you just see a band come out and they kept themselves in shape and they're fucking killing it as much as they are older, it's, it's like, uh, like I'm not gonna name names, but I saw one band that made me think like, dude, I'm never drinking again. And then I when saw the violent femmes like two pages came out and with just a fucking tight sick aspect, like I watched them, I was like, man, I want to go play drums. I want to practice. I want to get better. Like there was nothing like negative about watching them. They just came out and find they for, they went on after uh, Melly Mel in in a 35 who fucking killed and you couldn't be more of a different band, like literally up to the stage would just turned.

Speaker 5:          01:02:49       Oh yeah, that's bad. As I did the I heart radio music festival thing, they have like the band, the stage of rotate one 80, and then they'd have the band and then they'd do the set dressing behind and then it would keep turning through ios.

Speaker 1:          01:03:01       I loved it. I loved that. They get like a down in Anaheim, they had it in like salt and pepper was on in a couple of people. It was fucking nuts. It was, he just knocked out like 10 of the bands that I should have seen back then. And uh, you know, they all sounded great. There was just, well I'll tell you off. It was just one person that I looked at and it was just like my God, but he was still singing great. But it's just like fuck dude.

Speaker 5:          01:03:25       Right. See we saw cameo like six months ago down. Uh, I can't remember what it was like by the water somewhere here in La and Roger Troutman. I remember Roger Blackmun, wasn't it? Yeah. What songs does he say? Um, Shay's all BRAC. Oh yeah. House. Okay. Of all those dude, he came, you know, cause he used to come out in like leather chaps and a cup, you know, it's the 70s fucking coke spoon around his neck and dude, he's still doing this. Like he can't, he can't win the belly. And I'm like, oh, not bad. Hips and knees and it's still wearing a company. It was like his leather pants in the back of look like the diaper and he would come out and he does like, dude was a little like trying to be sexy and wrote swivel his hips up. My wife has died laughing. She was like, he needs to fucking stop. Stop, stop doing that company. Even even, even when you keep yourself in shape and he was not in shape, you as you,

Speaker 1:          01:04:19       but you it, you can't do that sexy shit. And I'm telling you that is a self involved baby boomer thing that is being passed down. Like do Madonna is an unfucking believable shame for her fucking age. But when she starts twerking, it's just like, ah,

Speaker 5:          01:04:35       mom, what are you doing right?

Speaker 1:          01:04:39       Can't. Yeah. And then it's like the older guy, which you got to do is you got to like, uh, I sucked to de Rosa about this. You know, you gotta dress like Dana White, right when you get older, right? Like Dana White is roughly my age. Dana White, you know, he wears as suit, he ways to college. Sure doesn't have the title, the title, rather than, so he's a little bit relaxed, but he's dressed like he doesn't look like a creep, you know what I mean? But if he was to show up, you know what I mean? I'm not just putting it on him, just saying that, that fucking look, just, you take a guy the same age, my fucking age, and you're going to try to fucking pull off like a tank top. Like even like when you watch these, these, those P90x things, right. And the old guys that are working at a 58 year old guys with the ABS, it's like, dude, amazing putting your fucking shirt on because there's nothing they could do for the loss of Alaska density in your fucking skin. Yeah. You're decomposing in front of me.

Speaker 1:          01:05:37       Yeah. She'd be sitting in a giant fruit bowl. Little little fruit flies flying around you. So I learned a lot. That guy watched, uh, those bands and it was the people that we're comfortable with their age and kept himself in shape and came out and we're having a good fucking time. Oh yeah. It was just like, aw man, this is fucking granular. Like you just were really excited. But if they came out like you know, they'd fucking this, this still fucking partying. Like you know Keith Richards back in the day and then they're coming to and you're going to still wear like leather and shit bro. Um, HD net have this concert series a couple of years ago and there were, so these commercials for them for the concert series and they would show they show at Steppenwolf. Right? You don't know, you can are gonna kill me. Then again. And then that middle section that goes on for fucking ever memories used to work in a warehouse.

Speaker 1:          01:06:35       That whole fucking the psychedelic part. Yeah, it goes on for two. Sorry I interrupted your story. But they would show like them playing concerts back in like the 70s and there'll be jam packed arena and people going crazy, the crowd and then they show him now like it was smashed cups from then to now. Oh now they're playing on like an outdoor stage tire audience. Oh, only about 300 people are sitting on this lawn in like lawn chairs and I'm like, I know because we're all too well. Yeah. All the people that love him back then are old now too. So it was like watching people perform at like shady acres, retirement community. I know, but those guys are like 70 I know it's fucking, I'm sure that guide, the band still sounds great and everything, but it's gotta be weird having fun with it. Just like fuck, we still have to make money.

Speaker 1:          01:07:19       Only one. A lot of those guys they got, they got so stolen from and just completely ripped off and then you add that if somebody got divorced and shit, yeah, you're going to be singing that song. Ugh. I just realized I cross my legs wearing slippers in front of you. I'm sorry. Those are great celebrities. Great slippers. Now I finally bought some new socks and I just wanna I wanna to try to keep them white for a lot of things for you. I bought, that's why I wear black socks all that. Well, I can't wear black socks if I have on like dark sneakers though. Why not? I mean, I can't wear white socks with dark sneakers now if, I'm sorry if I have white sneakers, I need white socks. Really? Yeah, I guess. Yeah, I have mostly white sneakers. No offense.

Speaker 1:          01:08:03       Um, no, but I think a lot of those guys that, that's what ends up happening. So I think the way to do it is, and I haven't figured out how to get into the game yet, is you get to a certain point when you're, the height of your, your earning power. I think you should already be planning your graceful exit from this business because it's so broad strategy. So I think rather than going out and buy, buying flashy shit, fucking hovercraft and all the dumb shit that that art is by, by start buying rentals, man rental units, I'm not buying a helicopter. I'd love to, but I, I can't, uh, I can't justify like maintaining it to fucking play this. I got a kid now, man. I came from smash cut [inaudible] the, you know what's cool is I'm doing Irvine on Tuesday and Wednesday. You know that's like, you know, it's like two hours of traffic.

Speaker 1:          01:08:55       Oh to, yeah, I'm renting a little 22 I'll blah blah blah blah. Up Bubba. Bob. Go right over it in like 20 minutes. That was fucking awesome. It is us. Yeah. Oh my God dude. Fuck five. I did my time. I did my, I'm not fucking do it. Am I me yet? Another comedian talking about how horrific the traffic was during the first 10 minutes. How about I go up there and be the comic who's in a good mood, right? That's what people are coming. Outflows. 10 minute helicopter ride. Oh yeah, that's fantastic. Oh right up in fucking over it. And this is the thing, I'd like to look at the parking structure on the roof of the Improv. Now, um, we're trying to find, you got to call up. It's like every time you fly you learn something. So I'm learning this time is like, they'll have this, all these helipads so you can even go beyond the airports.

Speaker 1:          01:09:44       Cause I'm thinking like John Wayne is close by, but then there's another one that's even closer, but then there's like these helipads on top of buildings and all were, I'll just all around it. But you have to, you just have to call him and tell him you go fly down a solo. No, no, no, no, no. I don't have confidence to fly at night. I fly solo during the day, but at night it's just a whole different ballgame. And I'll never forget one night doing a night flight. I was with an instructor. And how you transition, uh, the airspace at lax is either you fly under, you're not underneath it, but you, you're, you're along the coastline flying like a hundred feet off the water, which is awesome and scary as shit. Um, and or you fly over [inaudible] over like those glow stick things. Like, you know, I think it's like a 2000, I've only done it once like 2000 feet or above.

Speaker 1:          01:10:36       So with night, we flew over over the [inaudible] and you know, it's fucking freaky because there's all these jets coming in that if you're at the same altitude altitude t-bone, you said we're flying. And I go, yeah man, I go to the cow pig, that end, that's crazy. And how big these planes are landing here? And he just goes, yeah, there's one right there. And it was like almost underneath us. But because when you're looking down and there's not a lot of streetlights and just the lights from the city, I didn't see like a fucking, you know, holy seven, 49, seven 40, say whatever the fuck they fly. Now, I don't know what the numbers are anymore was like going right underneath this and I was just like, wow, you didn't see that? No, but he did this the right, this is when I was getting my license, so I didn't know how to, to look for Shit and everything.

Speaker 1:          01:11:20       So night flying isn't entirely, entirely different games. So, uh, I'll be flying down, um, with one of my instructors. So, but if it was, if it was like the, uh, if it was the fucking summertime though, but every time, every time it's going to, by the end of the show it's going to be dark out. But that is a goal of mine who's I would love to fly solo. Now let me ask you this, how much does it cost? It will cost you to do that. It will fly down to, you have to like run through vehicle and peds. It's like 300 bucks. I mean it's, it's a decent amount of money, but it's also like that bad though. It's not just going to close. [inaudible] grown, but no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, nothing like that. It's like 300 bucks and then, uh, and it's fun and then I get another, like I'll get like another, I'm going to get another two hours under my belt flying at night.

Speaker 1:          01:12:13       And uh, I got this killer fucking instructor right now. My auto rotations are the best they've ever been, where they basically will fly around now when he just sorta like he'll just out of know what go, you know, engine failure and then you just have to pick a fucking spot. And you know, you just, I mean we don't take it all the way down to the ground and I land on somebody's fucking front yard. But um, I have learned so much, I always had great instructors, but this guy that I have now is, is really got my confidence back up again where, um, for me to go solo and everything would be, you know, I would have the confidence to do it, but I like, but what's good is I, I'm super fucking cautious. I'm not one of those people, you know, with the fucking nine oh two one oh look on my face, you know, show up with like a fucking sculptures now.

Speaker 1:          01:13:02       But there's a lot of people that get, they get their a, they get their license and once they get the license they stopped the training and because it got it well cause they know how to fly. And then, you know, and then you just, they just started flying around. Oh my God. Yeah. So did you fly your parents? Yeah. Then when they came out here and visit it. But I also did that with like an instructor and that was a will the impress your parents blown away that a, they definitely day had a good time and they are very conservative people. So, you know, sometimes you don't necessarily know what they're thinking or going crazy. They won't go crazy. They were just like lovely. That was nice. I was very, uh, very in trouble. I was exhilarated. I heart is beating out of my chest right now.

Speaker 1:          01:13:46       Um, no, my, my dad, uh, had a pilot's license. It has a positive cause once you get it. So like he knows other, no, he had fixed wing, so he knew a lot of the shit that was going on. So, uh, you know, but my mother thought it was awesome. She loves it and wasn't scared at all. My Dad, I think because he had a license, understood that probably more of the danger of it and that type of shit. So he probably thought it was a little squirrely when we will 100 feet off the fucking water flying under the, you know, the jets or whatever. But, uh, I'd say it's one of the great things that I've done in my fucking adult life. And, um, I don't know, but we're not here to talk about make, we're here to talk about you. We've already done an hour and 15 minutes just like that.

Speaker 1:          01:14:26       Uh, Hey, can I, can I come down the 90th tape dude or nothing more? Okay. All right. Well, some people, you know, like me, I'd be like, no, I don't want anybody there. Nobody. I fucking know. So it's just one more thing for me to think about. We're going to do like, you know, I'm going to come on, I'm going to be brought from all stays out.

They're the best. Hey, so I'll uh, I'll tell you this when you do soundcheck. Yeah, just make sure, speaking of Patrice, cause I haven't, one time he, he did some taping and the sound wasn't right and when it came time for him to do his taping, you know, they thought he was a pain in the ass, but he was like, this sound isn't right. And he was like, I want to be the loudest thing in the room, so make sure your monitors so you know, you gotta just make sure that is right. That's fucking right. Then it's like, yeah, you light saber is totally on and you know, you know that deal. If you get up there and you can't fucking hear yourself and God knows when you go to tape, there's always somebody who fucks something like that.

Speaker 1:          01:16:00       Oh, I thought it'd be good to just have the sound way down, you know? Um, just make sure all of that shits right and then go to school up there and kill it.
