Ilya you mentioned the Critical Rendering Path. It sounds pretty important.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.190
&gt;&gt; It is. The Critical Rendering Path is the sequence of steps

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:15.720
that the browser goes through to convert the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.990
into actual pixels on the screen. And, if we can optimize that,

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.990
then we can make our pages render fast, which makes for happier users.

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:25.520
&gt;&gt; Cool. So what's involved in it?

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.010
&gt;&gt; So, this diagram captures all of the essentials.

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:30.380
First we grab the HTML and we start building the

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:33.630
document object model. We then have to fetch the CSS and build the

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.250
CSS object model. We combine those two to create the Render Tree. Then

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.840
we have to figure out where everything goes on the page, which is

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.740
the Layout step. And then finally we can paint pixels on the actual screen.

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:45.760
&gt;&gt; Wait a second though, you only

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.670
talked about HTML and CSS, what about JavaScript?

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.730
&gt;&gt; right, yeah, so that's a big important part of the performance

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.013
puzzle. But before we get there let's talk about, how we construct

00:00:56.013 --> 00:00:58.820
a document object model, the CSS object model, and then

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.870
we'll talk about how JavaScript affects the actual rendering pipeline.

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:03.510
&gt;&gt; Okay, that sounds great.
