00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:05.100
Toward the end of his life Martin Luther
King was surrounded by the forces of

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.170
both chaos and community. The chaos of
Jim Crow America the chaos of white

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.910
supremacy and unfairness in the
workplace but he was also surrounded by

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.560
the community of the black freedom
struggle. This remains with us today. We

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.910
are surrounded by the chaos of forces
that are trying to pull us back to

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.849
another time in American history but
we're also full of community and the

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.559
communities that are waging struggles to
actually advance human dignity and human

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.460
freedom and liberation. At the Ralph
Bunche Center for after American Studies

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.469
we walk hand-in-hand with the struggles
to advance humanity and community.

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.789
What we're doing is we're using the research of the university to look at questions

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.050
of employment for African Americans and
questions of how the prison system has

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.460
impacted black families and black
communities. We invite you to join us in

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.039
this work this research and in the
struggle.
