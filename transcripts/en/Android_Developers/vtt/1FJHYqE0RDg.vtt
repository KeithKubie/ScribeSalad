&gt;&gt; BRIN: Hi. Welcome to Mountain View, California.
I'm speaking here at Google's Headquarters.

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.650
And I'd like to tell you about something I'm
really excited about. It's called Android

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:19.960
and it's a new open source operating system
and software platform for mobile phones. Just

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:25.740
like I learned how to write great services
in software upon free tools for the web like

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.840
Linux and GNU, now with Android you'll be
able to do the exact same things on mobile

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:37.350
phones. The software is all free, the source
is completely available, and we expect great

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:44.570
new powerful applications to be developed
on it. The SDK is being released right now

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.190
and you can download it. And to show you some
of the highlights and some of the applications

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.180
we've already developed, here's Steve.
&gt;&gt; HOROWITZ: You've probably been hearing

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.530
a little bit about the G-Phone lately. I'm
here to tell you there is actually no G-Phone.

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:02.010
Instead, I'd like to introduce you to the
Android platform. This is a platform, we hope,

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.160
will enable people to create thousands of
G-Phones. The first device I'd like to show

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.830
you today is a prototype that I've been living
with for about the past six month, because

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:14.140
in order to create a great product, you actually
have to live with it. This particular device

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.690
is running a full version of the Android software
stack that has all the functionality you would

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:22.940
expect in a basic phone. Here's an example
of a home screen. This is a place where you

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:28.330
have access to all of your favorite applications,
such as your browser, maps or contacts. If

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:33.690
you want to call somebody, just type their
name and hit dial. And I'm calling my friend,

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:38.060
Erin. Of course, one of the things that we've
built into the software development kit is

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:43.830
the ability to interact and integrate applications
with one another. So another example using

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:48.640
contacts, let's say I want to find out where
Erin lives. I simply go and type her name.

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:54.140
And when I bring up her contact and select
her address, it'll take me right to the maps

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:59.950
application and it's going to zoom right in
to show me where Erin lives. If I click "see

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.849
on the map," then we notice that she lives
on Amphitheatre Parkway. But maybe I'm not

00:02:03.849 --> 00:02:07.190
quite sure where that is, so I want to zoom
out a little bit to see what freeway that

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:12.570
might be close to. There, we can see that
it's near the Highway 101. Now, if we go back

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:16.790
to the home page, one of the other things
I want to show you is the ability for devices

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:23.140
using the Android platform to receive notifications.
For example, here, I just received the notification

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.560
from my friend, Lexi, that says, "Eh, pizza
sounds good." That must be what she wants

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:33.010
for dinner. You noticed that it first showed
up at the top of the screen and it told me

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.420
that--the contents of that message. If I want
to go and read that message, all I have to

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.830
do is navigate up and you can see--oh, there's
my notification from Lexi. It says "Pizza

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:46.660
sounds good." If I want to reply, I just hit
the enter key and I can go into my text messaging

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:53.760
application and say, "Great," and away we
go. It sounds like we're having pizza for

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.010
dinner tonight. The next device I'd like to
show you is a more high-end prototype that

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:03.000
includes advanced features, such as high-speed
3G networking, accelerated 3D graphics, and

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:09.870
a touch screen. Let me show you the browser
application. A Web browser is based on the

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:15.180
open source WebKit. The industry standard
these days, it's the one that allows you to

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.180
see Web pages just as they would appear on
your desktop. The other thing that you'll

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.900
notice about a web browser is that it's loading
over the fast 3G data network. This device

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:30.040
is capable of accessing the Internet at 3G
speeds and loading web pages quite fast. Now,

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.040
the pages loaded here and we're zoomed in
a little bit. So, if I want to see more of

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.090
the page, I can simply grab it and pan around
a little bit. And if I want to see the page

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.750
in its full glory, I can simply zoom out and
see it just as what it would appear on my

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:48.440
desktop. We also have a rich visual history
for our browser. Go in here, and I can look

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:55.900
at the history for my browser and I can see
all the sites that I visited recently. The

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:01.900
next application I like to show you is global
time. This shows you the rich graphical powers

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:08.130
of the Android platform. And in this case,
it's using the 3D OpenGL ES to render a globe

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:13.660
here and allow me to very easily spin it with
my finger. I can also play with the earth

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:20.250
while it's spinning around. The Android graphics
API allows you to very easily mix 3D and 2D

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:24.840
graphics. Next, I'd like to show you some
of the advanced 3D hardware capabilities of

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:33.500
this prototype using "Quake." Any application
that is written to the Android OpenGLs API's

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:38.720
will be able to take full advantage of any
hardware acceleration. Now, I'd like to show

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:44.340
you the Maps application. I happen to be here
at the City of San Francisco. Using the touching

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:48.100
capabilities of this device, I can pan around
the city of San Francisco and watch those

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:53.900
map tiles load for me at 3G speeds. One of
the benefits of the Android platform is that

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:58.510
we build in basic functionality like map views
so your application doesn't have to reinvent

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:02.940
all the functionality in maps if you want
to build something on top of it. Here I am

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:10.690
at the Embarcadero in street view, starting
from wherever I was on maps. If I want to,

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:15.520
I can simply take my finger and I can move
that image around and I can pan around and

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:26.820
see what the Embarcadero looks like. I can
also zoom in. That was just a preview of some

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:30.340
of the things the Android platform can do.
We can't wait to see what developers will

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:33.790
come up with next.
&gt;&gt; BRIN: Welcome back, I hope you enjoyed

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:39.340
seeing some of the applications we have built
all ready. But the best applications are not

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:44.520
here yet. That's because they're going to
be written by you and many other developers

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:51.370
just like you. We'd like to reward these developers
and to recognize them as much as possible.

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:56.500
So we've set aside $10 million, which we're
going to give away to the people who develop

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:01.830
the best applications using Android. We're
looking forward to seeing some really great

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:08.090
apps: ones which are innovative; make use
of the great functionality available in Android

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:13.479
and on mobile phones; and things that are
really original that haven't been seen before.

00:06:13.479 --> 00:06:16.000
I look forward to seeing all of your work.
