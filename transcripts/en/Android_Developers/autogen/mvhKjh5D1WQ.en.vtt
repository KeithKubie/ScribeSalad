prototype that does exactly that
 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.670
prototype that does exactly that
so got the mainactivity this is going to

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680
so got the mainactivity this is going to
 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:07.960
so got the mainactivity this is going to
be our main form we've got nothing in

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:07.970
be our main form we've got nothing in
 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.630
be our main form we've got nothing in
here at the moment so this is our base

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:10.640
here at the moment so this is our base
 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.130
here at the moment so this is our base
layout we have text hello world so we

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140
layout we have text hello world so we
 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.240
layout we have text hello world so we
can keep this this textview because this

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.250
can keep this this textview because this
 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:20.340
can keep this this textview because this
is what we're going to stick our

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350
is what we're going to stick our
 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:22.510
is what we're going to stick our
location results so that we can see what

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520
location results so that we can see what
 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:23.740
location results so that we can see what
happens as we're getting location

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.750
happens as we're getting location
 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.020
happens as we're getting location
updates we want to give it an ID so

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030
updates we want to give it an ID so
 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.060
updates we want to give it an ID so
we're going to call this location text

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.070
we're going to call this location text
 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:32.470
we're going to call this location text
so now we're able to get access to it

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:32.480
so now we're able to get access to it
 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:36.010
so now we're able to get access to it
and we can change the text we don't want

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020
and we can change the text we don't want
 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.650
and we can change the text we don't want
that to be with hello world we want this

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:38.660
that to be with hello world we want this
 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:40.840
that to be with hello world we want this
to show our location so I'm just going

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850
to show our location so I'm just going
 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:46.690
to show our location so I'm just going
to set this to none received so let's

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700
to set this to none received so let's
 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.980
to set this to none received so let's
find let's find a button drag that on

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990
find let's find a button drag that on
 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:56.050
find let's find a button drag that on
here I'm going to put it underneath will

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060
here I'm going to put it underneath will
 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:04.450
here I'm going to put it underneath will
change the text here to location on and

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460
change the text here to location on and
 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:09.639
change the text here to location on and
we're going to grab a another button put

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649
we're going to grab a another button put
 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:16.460
we're going to grab a another button put
it next to the first button

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470
 
 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:22.220
 
I call this one location off fact I'm

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230
I call this one location off fact I'm
 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:29.699
I call this one location off fact I'm
going to drop it underneath

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709
 
 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:31.289
 
so now we have a really simple layout

00:02:31.289 --> 00:02:31.299
so now we have a really simple layout
 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:32.280
so now we have a really simple layout
which is going to let us turn the

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290
which is going to let us turn the
 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.470
which is going to let us turn the
location manager on and off so we're

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480
location manager on and off so we're
 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:35.640
location manager on and off so we're
going to need to make sure both of these

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650
going to need to make sure both of these
 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.250
going to need to make sure both of these
buttons have IDs as well so that we can

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260
buttons have IDs as well so that we can
 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.670
buttons have IDs as well so that we can
get access to them and that D is button

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680
get access to them and that D is button
 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.199
get access to them and that D is button
on this one is going to be button off

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209
on this one is going to be button off
 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:52.319
on this one is going to be button off
and we're going to change that text ID

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:52.329
and we're going to change that text ID
 

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:54.629
and we're going to change that text ID
as well so that it's consistent with the

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:54.639
as well so that it's consistent with the
 

00:02:54.639 --> 00:03:00.929
as well so that it's consistent with the
others this will be text edit location

00:03:00.929 --> 00:03:00.939
others this will be text edit location
 

00:03:00.939 --> 00:03:03.270
others this will be text edit location
now we are flip back to the main

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280
now we are flip back to the main
 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:11.350
now we are flip back to the main
activity

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:11.360
 
 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:18.110
 
you

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120
 
 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:28.850
 
and we know that we have an off button

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860
 
 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:38.520
 
and we have an edit text

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530
 
 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.280
 
yeah we're also going to want location

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290
yeah we're also going to want location
 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.530
yeah we're also going to want location
manager so we're going to use to get

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540
manager so we're going to use to get
 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:49.530
manager so we're going to use to get
location updates location manager and

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540
location updates location manager and
 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.620
location updates location manager and
then we're going to want to use the on

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630
then we're going to want to use the on
 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:57.790
then we're going to want to use the on
button to enable our location updates

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:57.800
button to enable our location updates
 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:03.690
button to enable our location updates
so we'll assign a new onclicklistener

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:03.700
 
 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.420
 
and request location updates from their

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.430
and request location updates from their
 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:15.400
and request location updates from their
using and the location manager

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:15.410
 
 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:20.069
 
you

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:20.079
 
 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:23.820
 
and then we will have like to turn off

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830
and then we will have like to turn off
 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:25.740
and then we will have like to turn off
the location let's know so do the same

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750
the location let's know so do the same
 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:31.200
the location let's know so do the same
thing for the off button

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.210
 
 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:33.520
 
all right well first we know this is a

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:33.530
all right well first we know this is a
 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:40.510
all right well first we know this is a
textview not an edit text

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:40.520
 
 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:44.340
 
let's go ahead and create these values

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:44.350
let's go ahead and create these values
 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:49.080
let's go ahead and create these values
meantime it's going to be ten seconds

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:49.090
meantime it's going to be ten seconds
 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:53.820
meantime it's going to be ten seconds
distance one meter now for a provider

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:53.830
distance one meter now for a provider
 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:56.140
distance one meter now for a provider
we're going to use the location manager

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:56.150
we're going to use the location manager
 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:02.410
we're going to use the location manager
again get best provider criteria which

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:02.420
again get best provider criteria which
 

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:04.390
again get best provider criteria which
is enabled in fact we're going to go

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:04.400
is enabled in fact we're going to go
 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:14.610
is enabled in fact we're going to go
ahead and move that in here

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:14.620
 
 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:24.570

life and fine is going to give you a

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:33.280
life and fine is going to give you a
 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.010
life and fine is going to give you a
higher accuracy really you're just

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:35.020
higher accuracy really you're just
 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:36.899
higher accuracy really you're just
choosing between using the GPS or using

00:05:36.899 --> 00:05:36.909
choosing between using the GPS or using
 

00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:38.640
choosing between using the GPS or using
the Wi-Fi all right so now what we need

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:38.650
the Wi-Fi all right so now what we need
 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:40.680
the Wi-Fi all right so now what we need
is a listener you could do that in line

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:40.690
is a listener you could do that in line
 

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:41.969
is a listener you could do that in line
as well but we're going to do that out

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:41.979
as well but we're going to do that out
 

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:45.629
as well but we're going to do that out
here

00:05:45.629 --> 00:05:45.639
 
 

00:05:45.639 --> 00:05:47.459
 
so at this point we're going to need to

00:05:47.459 --> 00:05:47.469
so at this point we're going to need to
 

00:05:47.469 --> 00:05:48.990
so at this point we're going to need to
have our text view

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:49.000
have our text view
 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.600
have our text view
have a scope that we can actually access

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:51.610
have a scope that we can actually access
 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:55.830
have a scope that we can actually access
here so let's bring it outside of our on

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:55.840
here so let's bring it outside of our on
 

00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:00.480
here so let's bring it outside of our on
create and on location changed we're

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:00.490
create and on location changed we're
 

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:03.890
create and on location changed we're
going to set our location text

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:03.900
going to set our location text
 

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:05.490
going to set our location text
eventually we're going to want to update

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:05.500
eventually we're going to want to update
 

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:07.439
eventually we're going to want to update
this for now we just want to see it

00:06:07.439 --> 00:06:07.449
this for now we just want to see it
 

00:06:07.449 --> 00:06:11.330
this for now we just want to see it
updating as the location changes come in

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:11.340
updating as the location changes come in
 

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:13.610
updating as the location changes come in
if our location provider is disabled

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:13.620
if our location provider is disabled
 

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:16.280
if our location provider is disabled
we'll want to update the text to say as

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:16.290
we'll want to update the text to say as
 

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:18.350
we'll want to update the text to say as
much now in the real world you're going

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:18.360
much now in the real world you're going
 

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:19.850
much now in the real world you're going
to want to do something there which is

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:19.860
to want to do something there which is
 

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:21.680
to want to do something there which is
most likely find a different location

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:21.690
most likely find a different location
 

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:24.200
most likely find a different location
provider to use this is usually the GPS

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:24.210
provider to use this is usually the GPS
 

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:25.700
provider to use this is usually the GPS
got turned off for some reason

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:25.710
got turned off for some reason
 

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:27.590
got turned off for some reason
but again through our purposes we just

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:27.600
but again through our purposes we just
 

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:30.820
but again through our purposes we just
want to be able to see what is happening

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:30.830
want to be able to see what is happening
 

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:32.960
want to be able to see what is happening
so if we come down here we can see

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:32.970
so if we come down here we can see
 

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:34.970
so if we come down here we can see
something is underlined in red so what's

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:34.980
something is underlined in red so what's
 

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:36.920
something is underlined in red so what's
going on here now we need to get the

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:36.930
going on here now we need to get the
 

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:38.840
going on here now we need to get the
right access permissions to be able to

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:38.850
right access permissions to be able to
 

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:42.230
right access permissions to be able to
get fine location so let's do that add

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:42.240
get fine location so let's do that add
 

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:46.280
get fine location so let's do that add
permissions for fine location all right

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:46.290
permissions for fine location all right
 

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:48.890
permissions for fine location all right
so what we're seeing here is so what

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:48.900
so what we're seeing here is so what
 

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:51.050
so what we're seeing here is so what
we're seeing here is actually the new

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:51.060
we're seeing here is actually the new
 

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:53.210
we're seeing here is actually the new
permission model for M where we need to

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:53.220
permission model for M where we need to
 

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:55.580
permission model for M where we need to
ask for that flight location at the time

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:55.590
ask for that flight location at the time
 

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:57.860
ask for that flight location at the time
at which it's requested let's make this

00:06:57.860 --> 00:06:57.870
at which it's requested let's make this
 

00:06:57.870 --> 00:06:59.810
at which it's requested let's make this
a little bit more readable all right so

00:06:59.810 --> 00:06:59.820
a little bit more readable all right so
 

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:00.920
a little bit more readable all right so
this is going to check to make sure we

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:00.930
this is going to check to make sure we
 

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:03.260
this is going to check to make sure we
have permission whether it be fine or

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:03.270
have permission whether it be fine or
 

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:05.800
have permission whether it be fine or
coarse depending on what kind of

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:05.810
coarse depending on what kind of
 

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:08.450
coarse depending on what kind of
activity provider we are requesting in

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:08.460
activity provider we are requesting in
 

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:10.190
activity provider we are requesting in
this case it's going to be fine but we

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:10.200
this case it's going to be fine but we
 

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:11.480
this case it's going to be fine but we
may change that and this is going to

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:11.490
may change that and this is going to
 

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:13.850
may change that and this is going to
handle both of those cases now what it's

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:13.860
handle both of those cases now what it's
 

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:16.760
handle both of those cases now what it's
suggesting we do here is if that isn't

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:16.770
suggesting we do here is if that isn't
 

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:18.590
suggesting we do here is if that isn't
the case that we call request

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:18.600
the case that we call request
 

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:21.860
the case that we call request
permissions another then pop up a dialog

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:21.870
permissions another then pop up a dialog
 

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:23.990
permissions another then pop up a dialog
asking the user if they are going to

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:24.000
asking the user if they are going to
 

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.820
asking the user if they are going to
allow us to use it so we're going to

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:25.830
allow us to use it so we're going to
 

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:28.220
allow us to use it so we're going to
need to override this method if the user

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:28.230
need to override this method if the user
 

00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:30.890
need to override this method if the user
does allow us to the permission to use a

00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:30.900
does allow us to the permission to use a
 

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:39.090
does allow us to the permission to use a
location

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:39.100
 
 

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:56.789
 
you

00:07:56.789 --> 00:07:56.799
 
 

00:07:56.799 --> 00:07:59.079
 
now here we're gonna want to enable our

00:07:59.079 --> 00:07:59.089
now here we're gonna want to enable our
 

00:07:59.089 --> 00:08:06.520
now here we're gonna want to enable our
location updates updates

00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:06.530
 
 

00:08:06.530 --> 00:08:09.880
 
which of course doesn't yet exist so

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:09.890
which of course doesn't yet exist so
 

00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:13.090
which of course doesn't yet exist so
let's put that in here as well which

00:08:13.090 --> 00:08:13.100
let's put that in here as well which
 

00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:15.450
let's put that in here as well which
means we're going to want to call it

00:08:15.450 --> 00:08:15.460
means we're going to want to call it
 

00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:20.050
means we're going to want to call it
here of course that means we need to

00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:20.060
here of course that means we need to
 

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:22.780
here of course that means we need to
move our location manager to a different

00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:22.790
move our location manager to a different
 

00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:37.130
move our location manager to a different
scope let's put them up here as well

00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:37.140
 
 

00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:42.219
 
you

00:08:42.219 --> 00:08:42.229
 
 

00:08:42.229 --> 00:08:44.329
 
now I'm going to take their advice I'm

00:08:44.329 --> 00:08:44.339
now I'm going to take their advice I'm
 

00:08:44.339 --> 00:08:54.830
now I'm going to take their advice I'm
going to call request permission here

00:08:54.830 --> 00:08:54.840
 
 

00:08:54.840 --> 00:09:00.800
 
you

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:00.810
 
 

00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:04.650
 
now I'm gonna move this down here as

00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:04.660
now I'm gonna move this down here as
 

00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:05.990
now I'm gonna move this down here as
well

00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:06.000
well
 

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.760
well
meantime in distance needs to get moved

00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:08.770
meantime in distance needs to get moved
 

00:09:08.770 --> 00:09:15.780
meantime in distance needs to get moved
also

00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:15.790
 
 

00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:17.940
 
this gets us far enough that we're able

00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:17.950
this gets us far enough that we're able
 

00:09:17.950 --> 00:09:21.150
this gets us far enough that we're able
to see whether or not our location call

00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:21.160
to see whether or not our location call
 

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:23.550
to see whether or not our location call
works so when we fire up the emulator

00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:23.560
works so when we fire up the emulator
 

00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:32.319
works so when we fire up the emulator
and see what that looks like

00:09:32.319 --> 00:09:32.329
 
 

00:09:32.329 --> 00:09:37.450
 
you

00:09:37.450 --> 00:09:37.460
 
 

00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:42.630
 
let's start by turning a location on

00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:42.640
 
 

00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:48.360
 
so this is the permission I say allow so

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:48.370
so this is the permission I say allow so
 

00:09:48.370 --> 00:09:53.540
so this is the permission I say allow so
just go with location and let's send it

00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:53.550
just go with location and let's send it
 

00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:55.710
just go with location and let's send it
so you can see the updates coming

00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:55.720
so you can see the updates coming
 

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:59.850
so you can see the updates coming
through that location off and nothing

00:09:59.850 --> 00:09:59.860
through that location off and nothing
 

00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:00.480
through that location off and nothing
happens

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:00.490
happens
 

00:10:00.490 --> 00:10:02.009
happens
now of course for our testing we really

00:10:02.009 --> 00:10:02.019
now of course for our testing we really
 

00:10:02.019 --> 00:10:06.660
now of course for our testing we really
like to see all of these instantly so

00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:06.670
like to see all of these instantly so
 

00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:08.130
like to see all of these instantly so
why don't we go back into our code and

00:10:08.130 --> 00:10:08.140
why don't we go back into our code and
 

00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:12.630
why don't we go back into our code and
change the update rates this should get

00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:12.640
change the update rates this should get
 

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:15.870
change the update rates this should get
us all updates all the time so now I'm

00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:15.880
us all updates all the time so now I'm
 

00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:17.610
us all updates all the time so now I'm
going to tidy up a little bit and move a

00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:17.620
going to tidy up a little bit and move a
 

00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:21.579
going to tidy up a little bit and move a
few things around

00:10:21.579 --> 00:10:21.589
 
 

00:10:21.589 --> 00:10:24.379
 
my real goal here is just to separate

00:10:24.379 --> 00:10:24.389
my real goal here is just to separate
 

00:10:24.389 --> 00:10:26.660
my real goal here is just to separate
all the boilerplate code like listeners

00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:26.670
all the boilerplate code like listeners
 

00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:28.340
all the boilerplate code like listeners
click handlers and permission checks

00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:28.350
click handlers and permission checks
 

00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:33.550
click handlers and permission checks
from my app and business logic

00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:33.560
 
 

00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:35.920
 
this separation is also going to make it

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:35.930
this separation is also going to make it
 

00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:37.840
this separation is also going to make it
easier for me later I'm going to need to

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:37.850
easier for me later I'm going to need to
 

00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:39.820
easier for me later I'm going to need to
move and refactor it and pull it out of

00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:39.830
move and refactor it and pull it out of
 

00:10:39.830 --> 00:10:42.010
move and refactor it and pull it out of
this monolithic activity into the

00:10:42.010 --> 00:10:42.020
this monolithic activity into the
 

00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:43.600
this monolithic activity into the
appropriate services and intent

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:43.610
appropriate services and intent
 

00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:47.829
appropriate services and intent
receivers

00:10:47.829 --> 00:10:47.839
 
 

00:10:47.839 --> 00:10:50.240
 
ideally I want to be able to see all the

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:50.250
ideally I want to be able to see all the
 

00:10:50.250 --> 00:10:51.620
ideally I want to be able to see all the
code I'm going to be adjusting and

00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:51.630
code I'm going to be adjusting and
 

00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:55.039
code I'm going to be adjusting and
changing regularly on the same screen

00:10:55.039 --> 00:10:55.049
changing regularly on the same screen
 

00:10:55.049 --> 00:10:57.509
changing regularly on the same screen
now we know the next thing which we need

00:10:57.509 --> 00:10:57.519
now we know the next thing which we need
 

00:10:57.519 --> 00:10:59.009
now we know the next thing which we need
to do so we know that we're going to

00:10:59.009 --> 00:10:59.019
to do so we know that we're going to
 

00:10:59.019 --> 00:11:01.349
to do so we know that we're going to
want to react to the location changing

00:11:01.349 --> 00:11:01.359
want to react to the location changing
 

00:11:01.359 --> 00:11:03.210
want to react to the location changing
because the ultimate goal here is once

00:11:03.210 --> 00:11:03.220
because the ultimate goal here is once
 

00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:05.069
because the ultimate goal here is once
we get within a certain distance of our

00:11:05.069 --> 00:11:05.079
we get within a certain distance of our
 

00:11:05.079 --> 00:11:07.590
we get within a certain distance of our
house used to turn on the lights so

00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:07.600
house used to turn on the lights so
 

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:09.359
house used to turn on the lights so
we're going to need at least one more

00:11:09.359 --> 00:11:09.369
we're going to need at least one more
 

00:11:09.369 --> 00:11:11.999
we're going to need at least one more
method which is going to turn on the

00:11:11.999 --> 00:11:12.009
method which is going to turn on the
 

00:11:12.009 --> 00:11:23.610
method which is going to turn on the
lights and we're going to call that here

00:11:23.610 --> 00:11:23.620
 
 

00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:28.760
 
you

00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:28.770
 
 

00:11:28.770 --> 00:11:31.160
 
okay so we need to find out whether we

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:31.170
okay so we need to find out whether we
 

00:11:31.170 --> 00:11:32.079
okay so we need to find out whether we
are

00:11:32.079 --> 00:11:32.089
are
 

00:11:32.089 --> 00:11:33.670
are
set distance so we'll probably want to

00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:33.680
set distance so we'll probably want to
 

00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:36.030
set distance so we'll probably want to
have ways to set all of that in our UI

00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:36.040
have ways to set all of that in our UI
 

00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:39.210
have ways to set all of that in our UI
but for now let's just go and make some

00:11:39.210 --> 00:11:39.220
but for now let's just go and make some
 

00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:41.559
but for now let's just go and make some
statics so we're going to need to know

00:11:41.559 --> 00:11:41.569
statics so we're going to need to know
 

00:11:41.569 --> 00:11:44.499
statics so we're going to need to know
how far our current location is from our

00:11:44.499 --> 00:11:44.509
how far our current location is from our
 

00:11:44.509 --> 00:11:50.090
how far our current location is from our
home location

00:11:50.090 --> 00:11:50.100
 
 

00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:53.750
 
so we can do that by saying location dot

00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:53.760
so we can do that by saying location dot
 

00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:58.350
so we can do that by saying location dot
distance 2 and we can say here home

00:11:58.350 --> 00:11:58.360
distance 2 and we can say here home
 

00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:00.630
distance 2 and we can say here home
location which means we're going to need

00:12:00.630 --> 00:12:00.640
location which means we're going to need
 

00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:05.220
location which means we're going to need
to have a home location so let's do that

00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:05.230
to have a home location so let's do that
 

00:12:05.230 --> 00:12:09.269
to have a home location so let's do that
let's cheat do that manually explicitly

00:12:09.269 --> 00:12:09.279
let's cheat do that manually explicitly
 

00:12:09.279 --> 00:12:12.030
let's cheat do that manually explicitly
set the latitude and longitude right

00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:12.040
set the latitude and longitude right
 

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:13.530
set the latitude and longitude right
neither of these exist

00:12:13.530 --> 00:12:13.540
neither of these exist
 

00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:16.590
neither of these exist
oops neither these exist I'm going to

00:12:16.590 --> 00:12:16.600
oops neither these exist I'm going to
 

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:18.030
oops neither these exist I'm going to
interrupt myself here to point something

00:12:18.030 --> 00:12:18.040
interrupt myself here to point something
 

00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:20.070
interrupt myself here to point something
out you may have noticed that I'm

00:12:20.070 --> 00:12:20.080
out you may have noticed that I'm
 

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:21.990
out you may have noticed that I'm
setting the longitude twice and never

00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:22.000
setting the longitude twice and never
 

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.300
setting the longitude twice and never
setting the latitude that's something I

00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:24.310
setting the latitude that's something I
 

00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:26.490
setting the latitude that's something I
didn't notice at the time and it's going

00:12:26.490 --> 00:12:26.500
didn't notice at the time and it's going
 

00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:29.400
didn't notice at the time and it's going
to cause me problems later I'm gonna go

00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:29.410
to cause me problems later I'm gonna go
 

00:12:29.410 --> 00:12:34.470
to cause me problems later I'm gonna go
with Google's home location which I will

00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:34.480
with Google's home location which I will
 

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:44.340
with Google's home location which I will
grab

00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:44.350
 
 

00:12:44.350 --> 00:12:46.170
 
so we have a distance which is the

00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:46.180
so we have a distance which is the
 

00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:47.670
so we have a distance which is the
distance from your current location to

00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:47.680
distance from your current location to
 

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:49.350
distance from your current location to
the home location if it's less than the

00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:49.360
the home location if it's less than the
 

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:51.090
the home location if it's less than the
turn-on distance which we've set to ten

00:12:51.090 --> 00:12:51.100
turn-on distance which we've set to ten
 

00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:54.480
turn-on distance which we've set to ten
meters then toggle the lights on which

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:54.490
meters then toggle the lights on which
 

00:12:54.490 --> 00:12:57.600
meters then toggle the lights on which
is happening down here so we know that

00:12:57.600 --> 00:12:57.610
is happening down here so we know that
 

00:12:57.610 --> 00:12:58.830
is happening down here so we know that
we're going to want to turn the lights

00:12:58.830 --> 00:12:58.840
we're going to want to turn the lights
 

00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:00.500
we're going to want to turn the lights
on and often that this is going to be a

00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:00.510
on and often that this is going to be a
 

00:13:00.510 --> 00:13:03.180
on and often that this is going to be a
command over the interwebs we can't

00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:03.190
command over the interwebs we can't
 

00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:05.340
command over the interwebs we can't
actually are not allowed to access the

00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:05.350
actually are not allowed to access the
 

00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:08.160
actually are not allowed to access the
internet on the main thread so we're

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:08.170
internet on the main thread so we're
 

00:13:08.170 --> 00:13:09.510
internet on the main thread so we're
going to have to move it into a

00:13:09.510 --> 00:13:09.520
going to have to move it into a
 

00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:11.520
going to have to move it into a
background thread so we're going to do

00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:11.530
background thread so we're going to do
 

00:13:11.530 --> 00:13:14.310
background thread so we're going to do
that by creating an async task which

00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:14.320
that by creating an async task which
 

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:16.470
that by creating an async task which
create some simple handlers for us to

00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:16.480
create some simple handlers for us to
 

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:18.600
create some simple handlers for us to
make this life a little bit easier again

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:18.610
make this life a little bit easier again
 

00:13:18.610 --> 00:13:20.640
make this life a little bit easier again
like I said not the right approach to

00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:20.650
like I said not the right approach to
 

00:13:20.650 --> 00:13:22.860
like I said not the right approach to
this much better ways using services but

00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:22.870
this much better ways using services but
 

00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:24.240
this much better ways using services but
this is an easy way for us to get

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:24.250
this is an easy way for us to get
 

00:13:24.250 --> 00:13:26.730
this is an easy way for us to get
started a sync task lets you move a task

00:13:26.730 --> 00:13:26.740
started a sync task lets you move a task
 

00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:28.800
started a sync task lets you move a task
into the background optionally reporting

00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:28.810
into the background optionally reporting
 

00:13:28.810 --> 00:13:30.780
into the background optionally reporting
progress while it's being executed and

00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:30.790
progress while it's being executed and
 

00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:32.700
progress while it's being executed and
then synchronizing with the UI thread

00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:32.710
then synchronizing with the UI thread
 

00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:35.400
then synchronizing with the UI thread
when that task is complete we can choose

00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:35.410
when that task is complete we can choose
 

00:13:35.410 --> 00:13:37.320
when that task is complete we can choose
to pass parameters and optionally return

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:37.330
to pass parameters and optionally return
 

00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:39.750
to pass parameters and optionally return
a value from the background task here

00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:39.760
a value from the background task here
 

00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:41.550
a value from the background task here
we're going to use void to specify that

00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:41.560
we're going to use void to specify that
 

00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:43.290
we're going to use void to specify that
we don't want to use any parameters or

00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:43.300
we don't want to use any parameters or
 

00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:46.740
we don't want to use any parameters or
return any values I don't have an API or

00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:46.750
return any values I don't have an API or
 

00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:49.500
return any values I don't have an API or
s call to make that happen but let's

00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:49.510
s call to make that happen but let's
 

00:13:49.510 --> 00:13:50.940
s call to make that happen but let's
have a look we want to be able to have a

00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:50.950
have a look we want to be able to have a
 

00:13:50.950 --> 00:13:52.940
have a look we want to be able to have a
way of finding out that this is actually

00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:52.950
way of finding out that this is actually
 

00:13:52.950 --> 00:13:57.440
way of finding out that this is actually
happening why don't we return a boolean

00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:57.450
happening why don't we return a boolean
 

00:13:57.450 --> 00:13:59.430
happening why don't we return a boolean
all right so now we're gonna get a

00:13:59.430 --> 00:13:59.440
all right so now we're gonna get a
 

00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:02.130
all right so now we're gonna get a
return from the background task telling

00:14:02.130 --> 00:14:02.140
return from the background task telling
 

00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:04.170
return from the background task telling
us whether we've turned the lights on or

00:14:04.170 --> 00:14:04.180
us whether we've turned the lights on or
 

00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:06.660
us whether we've turned the lights on or
off I'm going to want to override on

post execute which is what gets called

00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:08.950
post execute which is what gets called
 

00:14:08.950 --> 00:14:11.030
post execute which is what gets called
once the background task has finished

00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:11.040
once the background task has finished
 

00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:15.600
once the background task has finished
and here we get the boolean returned to

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:15.610
and here we get the boolean returned to
 

00:14:15.610 --> 00:14:20.370
and here we get the boolean returned to
us and okay we'll use a toast here

00:14:20.370 --> 00:14:20.380
us and okay we'll use a toast here
 

00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:21.750
us and okay we'll use a toast here
because this is now synchronized to the

00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:21.760
because this is now synchronized to the
 

00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:24.120
because this is now synchronized to the
UI threads so the on post execute is

00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:24.130
UI threads so the on post execute is
 

00:14:24.130 --> 00:14:26.220
UI threads so the on post execute is
synchronized to UI thread so we can do

00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:26.230
synchronized to UI thread so we can do
 

00:14:26.230 --> 00:14:32.000
synchronized to UI thread so we can do
things like this

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:32.010
 
 

00:14:32.010 --> 00:14:34.250
 
all right let's have a look at what that

00:14:34.250 --> 00:14:34.260
all right let's have a look at what that
 

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:37.850
all right let's have a look at what that
looks like on the emulator so why don't

00:14:37.850 --> 00:14:37.860
looks like on the emulator so why don't
 

00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:40.790
looks like on the emulator so why don't
we just go ahead and paste in the

00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:40.800
we just go ahead and paste in the
 

00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:43.550
we just go ahead and paste in the
specific Latin long for home know what

00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:43.560
specific Latin long for home know what
 

00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:45.620
specific Latin long for home know what
we're expecting to happen is I hit Send

00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:45.630
we're expecting to happen is I hit Send
 

00:14:45.630 --> 00:14:47.630
we're expecting to happen is I hit Send
and we should get a toast that tells us

00:14:47.630 --> 00:14:47.640
and we should get a toast that tells us
 

00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:51.880
and we should get a toast that tells us
that we have turn the lights on that

00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:51.890

notice that the lat/long value has

00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:00.690
notice that the lat/long value has
 

00:15:00.690 --> 00:15:02.840
notice that the lat/long value has
changed but I was expecting a toast and

00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:02.850
changed but I was expecting a toast and
 

00:15:02.850 --> 00:15:05.060
changed but I was expecting a toast and
there isn't one you and I know that's

00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:05.070
there isn't one you and I know that's
 

00:15:05.070 --> 00:15:06.500
there isn't one you and I know that's
because I set the home location

00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:06.510
because I set the home location
 

00:15:06.510 --> 00:15:08.240
because I set the home location
longitude to its latitude and it's

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:08.250
longitude to its latitude and it's
 

00:15:08.250 --> 00:15:11.390
longitude to its latitude and it's
latitude to zero at the time I didn't

00:15:11.390 --> 00:15:11.400

00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:12.800

know if the problem was my asynchronous

00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:12.810
know if the problem was my asynchronous
 

00:15:12.810 --> 00:15:14.570
know if the problem was my asynchronous
code the toast or something related to

00:15:14.570 --> 00:15:14.580
code the toast or something related to
 

00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:16.490
code the toast or something related to
the distance from home calculation

00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:16.500
the distance from home calculation
 

00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:18.320

I knew the lat/long coming in was

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:18.330
I knew the lat/long coming in was
 

00:15:18.330 --> 00:15:20.570
I knew the lat/long coming in was
correct so I decided to update the UI to

00:15:20.570 --> 00:15:20.580
correct so I decided to update the UI to
 

00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:22.040
correct so I decided to update the UI to
show my current distance from Home

00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:22.050
show my current distance from Home
 

00:15:22.050 --> 00:15:24.320
show my current distance from Home
Instead that would be useful for

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:24.330
Instead that would be useful for
 

00:15:24.330 --> 00:15:26.180
Instead that would be useful for
debugging and give me a clue as to what

00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:26.190

was going wrong so now that we have all

00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:28.530
was going wrong so now that we have all
 

00:15:28.530 --> 00:15:31.130
was going wrong so now that we have all
of this rather than displaying the

00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:31.140
of this rather than displaying the
 

00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:32.870
of this rather than displaying the
latitude longitude which doesn't really

00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:32.880

make me anything I mean we know what

00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:34.350
make me anything I mean we know what
 

00:15:34.350 --> 00:15:36.770
make me anything I mean we know what
that does now so what we're gonna do

00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:36.780
that does now so what we're gonna do
 

00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:40.460
that does now so what we're gonna do
instead is update our text string to

00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:40.470
instead is update our text string to
 

00:15:40.470 --> 00:15:42.380
instead is update our text string to
show the distance so we can see as we're

00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:42.390
show the distance so we can see as we're
 

00:15:42.390 --> 00:15:43.850
show the distance so we can see as we're
getting closer because that's really the

00:15:43.850 --> 00:15:43.860
getting closer because that's really the
 

00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:45.580
getting closer because that's really the
critical part that we want to have now

00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:45.590
critical part that we want to have now
 

00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:47.690
critical part that we want to have now
okay so we're getting a distance now

00:15:47.690 --> 00:15:47.700
okay so we're getting a distance now
 

00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:48.580
okay so we're getting a distance now
perfect

00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:48.590
perfect
 

00:15:48.590 --> 00:15:50.900
perfect
eventually I try plugging in the values

00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:50.910
eventually I try plugging in the values
 

00:15:50.910 --> 00:15:52.580
eventually I try plugging in the values
for my home location at the Googleplex

00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:52.590
for my home location at the Googleplex
 

00:15:52.590 --> 00:15:54.950
for my home location at the Googleplex
and the distance result is not what I

00:15:54.950 --> 00:15:54.960
and the distance result is not what I
 

00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:55.640
and the distance result is not what I
expected

00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:55.650

00:15:55.650 --> 00:15:57.350

so now I know the problem is the

00:15:57.350 --> 00:15:57.360
so now I know the problem is the
 

00:15:57.360 --> 00:15:59.840
so now I know the problem is the
distance calculation I spent several

00:15:59.840 --> 00:15:59.850

pretty convinced I'm transposing lats

00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:04.050
pretty convinced I'm transposing lats
 

00:16:04.050 --> 00:16:06.290
pretty convinced I'm transposing lats
and long somewhere but eventually I see

00:16:06.290 --> 00:16:06.300
and long somewhere but eventually I see
 

00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:08.980

what's right in front of me

00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:08.990
what's right in front of me
 

00:16:08.990 --> 00:16:11.150

all right so you can see I sit back

00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:11.160
all right so you can see I sit back

latitude and longitude to the same value

00:16:17.090 --> 00:16:17.100
 
 

00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:20.340
 
and now we are much closer much closer

00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:20.350
and now we are much closer much closer
 

00:16:20.350 --> 00:16:22.440
and now we are much closer much closer
