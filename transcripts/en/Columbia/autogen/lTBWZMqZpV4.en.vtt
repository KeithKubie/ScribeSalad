a post 1960s counterculture neighborhood

00:48:51.130 --> 00:48:51.140
a post 1960s counterculture neighborhood
 

00:48:51.140 --> 00:48:52.660
a post 1960s counterculture neighborhood
and let me see a little bit about how I

00:48:52.660 --> 00:48:52.670
and let me see a little bit about how I
 

00:48:52.670 --> 00:48:55.479
and let me see a little bit about how I
arrived at this I grew up in San

00:48:55.479 --> 00:48:55.489
arrived at this I grew up in San
 

00:48:55.489 --> 00:48:58.180
arrived at this I grew up in San
Francisco I studied at Berkeley for many

00:48:58.180 --> 00:48:58.190
Francisco I studied at Berkeley for many
 

00:48:58.190 --> 00:49:02.309
Francisco I studied at Berkeley for many
years I lived in Kreuzberg in Berlin and

00:49:02.309 --> 00:49:02.319
years I lived in Kreuzberg in Berlin and
 

00:49:02.319 --> 00:49:04.749
years I lived in Kreuzberg in Berlin and
then one day I arrived in Ipanema to do

00:49:04.749 --> 00:49:04.759
then one day I arrived in Ipanema to do
 

00:49:04.759 --> 00:49:06.940
then one day I arrived in Ipanema to do
field work and I I looked around I said

00:49:06.940 --> 00:49:06.950
field work and I I looked around I said
 

00:49:06.950 --> 00:49:08.920
field work and I I looked around I said
there's something familiar here there's

00:49:08.920 --> 00:49:08.930
there's something familiar here there's
 

00:49:08.930 --> 00:49:10.599
there's something familiar here there's
a common thread and I started to think

00:49:10.599 --> 00:49:10.609
a common thread and I started to think
 

00:49:10.609 --> 00:49:13.890
a common thread and I started to think
that maybe there's something like a post

00:49:13.890 --> 00:49:13.900
that maybe there's something like a post
 

00:49:13.900 --> 00:49:15.999
that maybe there's something like a post
1960s counterculture neighborhood that

00:49:15.999 --> 00:49:16.009
1960s counterculture neighborhood that
 

00:49:16.009 --> 00:49:19.749
1960s counterculture neighborhood that
there's some sort of something left over

00:49:19.749 --> 00:49:19.759
there's some sort of something left over
 

00:49:19.759 --> 00:49:21.130
there's some sort of something left over
some sort of culture that gets

00:49:21.130 --> 00:49:21.140
some sort of culture that gets
 

00:49:21.140 --> 00:49:23.499
some sort of culture that gets
perpetuated over time and so I set out

00:49:23.499 --> 00:49:23.509
perpetuated over time and so I set out
 

00:49:23.509 --> 00:49:26.229
perpetuated over time and so I set out
to study this and what what I want to

00:49:26.229 --> 00:49:26.239
to study this and what what I want to
 

00:49:26.239 --> 00:49:30.519
to study this and what what I want to
argue is that that the night there was a

00:49:30.519 --> 00:49:30.529
argue is that that the night there was a
 

00:49:30.529 --> 00:49:32.950
argue is that that the night there was a
moment in the 1960s particularly 1968

00:49:32.950 --> 00:49:32.960
moment in the 1960s particularly 1968
 

00:49:32.960 --> 00:49:33.999
moment in the 1960s particularly 1968
where there was sort of a global

00:49:33.999 --> 00:49:34.009
where there was sort of a global
 

00:49:34.009 --> 00:49:36.940
where there was sort of a global
convergence where there was a global

00:49:36.940 --> 00:49:36.950
convergence where there was a global
 

00:49:36.950 --> 00:49:38.589
convergence where there was a global
youth counterculture movement and there

00:49:38.589 --> 00:49:38.599
youth counterculture movement and there
 

00:49:38.599 --> 00:49:41.410
youth counterculture movement and there
was a series of urban revolts and

00:49:41.410 --> 00:49:41.420
was a series of urban revolts and
 

00:49:41.420 --> 00:49:43.059
was a series of urban revolts and
neighborhoods around in cities around

00:49:43.059 --> 00:49:43.069
neighborhoods around in cities around
 

00:49:43.069 --> 00:49:45.670
neighborhoods around in cities around
the world you know Paris of course and

00:49:45.670 --> 00:49:45.680
the world you know Paris of course and
 

00:49:45.680 --> 00:49:48.400
the world you know Paris of course and
prague and mexico city often accompanied

00:49:48.400 --> 00:49:48.410
prague and mexico city often accompanied
 

00:49:48.410 --> 00:49:53.559
prague and mexico city often accompanied
by severe oppression and so i want to

00:49:53.559 --> 00:49:53.569
by severe oppression and so i want to
 

00:49:53.569 --> 00:49:55.630
by severe oppression and so i want to
kind of explain this this global moment

00:49:55.630 --> 00:49:55.640
kind of explain this this global moment
 

00:49:55.640 --> 00:49:58.870
kind of explain this this global moment
and what I'm arguing is that that this

00:49:58.870 --> 00:49:58.880
and what I'm arguing is that that this
 

00:49:58.880 --> 00:50:00.279
and what I'm arguing is that that this
was a collective product that this was

00:50:00.279 --> 00:50:00.289
was a collective product that this was
 

00:50:00.289 --> 00:50:02.769
was a collective product that this was
produced in a series of urban

00:50:02.769 --> 00:50:02.779
produced in a series of urban
 

00:50:02.779 --> 00:50:05.200
produced in a series of urban
neighborhoods around the world and that

00:50:05.200 --> 00:50:05.210
neighborhoods around the world and that
 

00:50:05.210 --> 00:50:13.589
neighborhoods around the world and that
it had significant urban consequences so

00:50:13.589 --> 00:50:13.599
it had significant urban consequences so
 

00:50:13.599 --> 00:50:15.969
it had significant urban consequences so
and so what I want to do here is make an

00:50:15.969 --> 00:50:15.979
and so what I want to do here is make an
 

00:50:15.979 --> 00:50:19.420
and so what I want to do here is make an
argument about how how global culture

00:50:19.420 --> 00:50:19.430
argument about how how global culture
 

00:50:19.430 --> 00:50:22.120
argument about how how global culture
works and how culture travels and we all

00:50:22.120 --> 00:50:22.130
works and how culture travels and we all
 

00:50:22.130 --> 00:50:23.799
works and how culture travels and we all
know this story but this is that this is

00:50:23.799 --> 00:50:23.809
know this story but this is that this is
 

00:50:23.809 --> 00:50:26.289
know this story but this is that this is
a concrete case where I've I've thought

00:50:26.289 --> 00:50:26.299
a concrete case where I've I've thought
 

00:50:26.299 --> 00:50:30.729
a concrete case where I've I've thought
about this a bit and I want to argue

00:50:30.729 --> 00:50:30.739
about this a bit and I want to argue
 

00:50:30.739 --> 00:50:33.400
about this a bit and I want to argue
that you know global he me of 1968 was

00:50:33.400 --> 00:50:33.410
that you know global he me of 1968 was
 

00:50:33.410 --> 00:50:35.410
that you know global he me of 1968 was
really a collective product that was a

00:50:35.410 --> 00:50:35.420
really a collective product that was a
 

00:50:35.420 --> 00:50:36.969
really a collective product that was a
lot of places were contributing and

00:50:36.969 --> 00:50:36.979
lot of places were contributing and
 

00:50:36.979 --> 00:50:37.690
lot of places were contributing and
consuming

00:50:37.690 --> 00:50:37.700
consuming
 

00:50:37.700 --> 00:50:39.910
consuming
producing but there is a certain

00:50:39.910 --> 00:50:39.920
producing but there is a certain
 

00:50:39.920 --> 00:50:42.490
producing but there is a certain
inequality between north and south for

00:50:42.490 --> 00:50:42.500
inequality between north and south for
 

00:50:42.500 --> 00:50:45.030
inequality between north and south for
example that that we can talk about

00:50:45.030 --> 00:50:45.040
example that that we can talk about
 

00:50:45.040 --> 00:50:47.500
example that that we can talk about
unequal cultural exchange maybe a

00:50:47.500 --> 00:50:47.510
unequal cultural exchange maybe a
 

00:50:47.510 --> 00:50:50.320
unequal cultural exchange maybe a
certain kind of cultural dependency but

00:50:50.320 --> 00:50:50.330
certain kind of cultural dependency but
 

00:50:50.330 --> 00:50:52.780
certain kind of cultural dependency but
that at least in in Rio and Ipanema in

00:50:52.780 --> 00:50:52.790
that at least in in Rio and Ipanema in
 

00:50:52.790 --> 00:50:57.070
that at least in in Rio and Ipanema in
Brazil who are on the receiving end of

00:50:57.070 --> 00:50:57.080
Brazil who are on the receiving end of
 

00:50:57.080 --> 00:50:59.050
Brazil who are on the receiving end of
this global culture in a lot of ways

00:50:59.050 --> 00:50:59.060
this global culture in a lot of ways
 

00:50:59.060 --> 00:51:02.800
this global culture in a lot of ways
that people very consciously borrowed

00:51:02.800 --> 00:51:02.810
that people very consciously borrowed
 

00:51:02.810 --> 00:51:05.620
that people very consciously borrowed
and assimilated ideas and picked and

00:51:05.620 --> 00:51:05.630
and assimilated ideas and picked and
 

00:51:05.630 --> 00:51:08.170
and assimilated ideas and picked and
picked and shoes and integrated them

00:51:08.170 --> 00:51:08.180
picked and shoes and integrated them
 

00:51:08.180 --> 00:51:11.160
picked and shoes and integrated them
into long-standing local traditions and

00:51:11.160 --> 00:51:11.170
into long-standing local traditions and
 

00:51:11.170 --> 00:51:13.900
into long-standing local traditions and
deploy them in a completely different

00:51:13.900 --> 00:51:13.910
deploy them in a completely different
 

00:51:13.910 --> 00:51:16.830
deploy them in a completely different
context in a very different rebellion

00:51:16.830 --> 00:51:16.840
context in a very different rebellion
 

00:51:16.840 --> 00:51:21.070
context in a very different rebellion
and so where where does this 1968 moment

00:51:21.070 --> 00:51:21.080
and so where where does this 1968 moment
 

00:51:21.080 --> 00:51:23.350
and so where where does this 1968 moment
come from it's a long story and I'll try

00:51:23.350 --> 00:51:23.360
come from it's a long story and I'll try
 

00:51:23.360 --> 00:51:26.080
come from it's a long story and I'll try
to make it brief but there's a global

00:51:26.080 --> 00:51:26.090
to make it brief but there's a global
 

00:51:26.090 --> 00:51:29.430
to make it brief but there's a global
economic moment the post-world war two

00:51:29.430 --> 00:51:29.440
economic moment the post-world war two
 

00:51:29.440 --> 00:51:32.260
economic moment the post-world war two
economic boom was pretty Universal

00:51:32.260 --> 00:51:32.270
economic boom was pretty Universal
 

00:51:32.270 --> 00:51:33.520
economic boom was pretty Universal
around the world and had different

00:51:33.520 --> 00:51:33.530
around the world and had different
 

00:51:33.530 --> 00:51:35.740
around the world and had different
consequences of different places but

00:51:35.740 --> 00:51:35.750
consequences of different places but
 

00:51:35.750 --> 00:51:37.330
consequences of different places but
it's certainly in Europe and North

00:51:37.330 --> 00:51:37.340
it's certainly in Europe and North
 

00:51:37.340 --> 00:51:40.840
it's certainly in Europe and North
America it meant a vast growth of

00:51:40.840 --> 00:51:40.850
America it meant a vast growth of
 

00:51:40.850 --> 00:51:43.180
America it meant a vast growth of
middle-class living standards and

00:51:43.180 --> 00:51:43.190
middle-class living standards and
 

00:51:43.190 --> 00:51:45.610
middle-class living standards and
particularly a large growth in student

00:51:45.610 --> 00:51:45.620
particularly a large growth in student
 

00:51:45.620 --> 00:51:50.110
particularly a large growth in student
population the other part of it is a

00:51:50.110 --> 00:51:50.120
population the other part of it is a
 

00:51:50.120 --> 00:51:52.950
population the other part of it is a
global sort of political moment where

00:51:52.950 --> 00:51:52.960
global sort of political moment where
 

00:51:52.960 --> 00:51:55.420
global sort of political moment where
you know after world war two there's an

00:51:55.420 --> 00:51:55.430
you know after world war two there's an
 

00:51:55.430 --> 00:51:57.580
you know after world war two there's an
interest in in democracy and

00:51:57.580 --> 00:51:57.590
interest in in democracy and
 

00:51:57.590 --> 00:51:59.170
interest in in democracy and
self-determination and there's there's a

00:51:59.170 --> 00:51:59.180
self-determination and there's there's a
 

00:51:59.180 --> 00:52:02.020
self-determination and there's there's a
rise of third-world nationalisms and

00:52:02.020 --> 00:52:02.030
rise of third-world nationalisms and
 

00:52:02.030 --> 00:52:04.900
rise of third-world nationalisms and
then of course we have Vietnam it's this

00:52:04.900 --> 00:52:04.910
then of course we have Vietnam it's this
 

00:52:04.910 --> 00:52:06.520
then of course we have Vietnam it's this
inspires rebellion around the world and

00:52:06.520 --> 00:52:06.530
inspires rebellion around the world and
 

00:52:06.530 --> 00:52:09.690
inspires rebellion around the world and
then there's a technological story where

00:52:09.690 --> 00:52:09.700
then there's a technological story where
 

00:52:09.700 --> 00:52:12.190
then there's a technological story where
this is a moment of a capitalist

00:52:12.190 --> 00:52:12.200
this is a moment of a capitalist
 

00:52:12.200 --> 00:52:13.720
this is a moment of a capitalist
expansion of course capitalism continues

00:52:13.720 --> 00:52:13.730
expansion of course capitalism continues
 

00:52:13.730 --> 00:52:15.850
expansion of course capitalism continues
to expand and technological innovation

00:52:15.850 --> 00:52:15.860
to expand and technological innovation
 

00:52:15.860 --> 00:52:18.270
to expand and technological innovation
and there's innovation particularly in

00:52:18.270 --> 00:52:18.280
and there's innovation particularly in
 

00:52:18.280 --> 00:52:20.170
and there's innovation particularly in
transportation and communication

00:52:20.170 --> 00:52:20.180
transportation and communication
 

00:52:20.180 --> 00:52:21.670
transportation and communication
technology so it becomes the world

00:52:21.670 --> 00:52:21.680
technology so it becomes the world
 

00:52:21.680 --> 00:52:23.520
technology so it becomes the world
becomes a much more global much more

00:52:23.520 --> 00:52:23.530
becomes a much more global much more
 

00:52:23.530 --> 00:52:26.470
becomes a much more global much more
tightly knit place and people are moving

00:52:26.470 --> 00:52:26.480
tightly knit place and people are moving
 

00:52:26.480 --> 00:52:29.050
tightly knit place and people are moving
around much more freely and culture and

00:52:29.050 --> 00:52:29.060
around much more freely and culture and
 

00:52:29.060 --> 00:52:30.670
around much more freely and culture and
ideas are moving around much more freely

00:52:30.670 --> 00:52:30.680
ideas are moving around much more freely
 

00:52:30.680 --> 00:52:32.230
ideas are moving around much more freely
and of course because the global

00:52:32.230 --> 00:52:32.240
and of course because the global
 

00:52:32.240 --> 00:52:33.790
and of course because the global
entertainment industries are developing

00:52:33.790 --> 00:52:33.800
entertainment industries are developing
 

00:52:33.800 --> 00:52:38.819
entertainment industries are developing
in an unprecedented way and

00:52:38.819 --> 00:52:38.829
 

00:52:38.829 --> 00:52:41.229
for Latin America there's a regional

00:52:41.229 --> 00:52:41.239
for Latin America there's a regional
 

00:52:41.239 --> 00:52:43.029
for Latin America there's a regional
contest and the most important thing for

00:52:43.029 --> 00:52:43.039
contest and the most important thing for
 

00:52:43.039 --> 00:52:44.319

Latin America really is the Cuban

the beach called the pier and the story
of the pier is that ipanema was booming

01:03:56.190 --> 01:03:56.200

01:03:58.290 --> 01:03:58.300
it was going from low rise to high rise
 

01:03:58.300 --> 01:04:00.060
it was going from low rise to high rise
during this period and the city

01:04:00.060 --> 01:04:00.070

government decided to build a sewage

01:04:04.260 --> 01:04:04.270
government decided to build a sewage
 

01:04:04.270 --> 01:04:06.450
government decided to build a sewage
pipe that would take all the sewage from

the neighborhood and send it through

01:04:08.280 --> 01:04:08.290

four kilometres out into the into the
 

01:04:09.970 --> 01:04:11.610
four kilometres out into the into the
open ocean and so in order to do this

01:04:11.610 --> 01:04:11.620
open ocean and so in order to do this
 

01:04:11.620 --> 01:04:13.920
open ocean and so in order to do this
they had to dredge and they had to make

01:04:13.920 --> 01:04:13.930
they had to dredge and they had to make
 

01:04:13.930 --> 01:04:16.800
they had to dredge and they had to make
this pier and so the dredging meant that

01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:16.810
this pier and so the dredging meant that
 

01:04:16.810 --> 01:04:18.660
this pier and so the dredging meant that
they were huge piles of sand piled up on

01:04:18.660 --> 01:04:18.670

the beach which normally doesn't have
 

01:04:20.440 --> 01:04:25.080
the beach which normally doesn't have
prominent sand dunes and so people would

01:04:25.080 --> 01:04:25.090
prominent sand dunes and so people would
 

01:04:25.090 --> 01:04:27.090
prominent sand dunes and so people would
go to the sand dunes to hi bana sanam to

01:04:27.090 --> 01:04:27.100
go to the sand dunes to hi bana sanam to
 

01:04:27.100 --> 01:04:29.220
go to the sand dunes to hi bana sanam to
smoke marijuana right and this is for

01:04:29.220 --> 01:04:29.230
smoke marijuana right and this is for
 

01:04:29.230 --> 01:04:30.330
smoke marijuana right and this is for
the beginning of the pier in the pier

01:04:30.330 --> 01:04:30.340
the beginning of the pier in the pier
 

01:04:30.340 --> 01:04:33.050
the beginning of the pier in the pier
becomes the hippie counterculture place

01:04:33.050 --> 01:04:33.060

what they bring to the table about
 

01:18:44.010 --> 01:18:46.160
what they bring to the table about
consensus and this had become an

planning process land use planning was

01:40:00.200 --> 01:40:00.210
planning process land use planning was
 

01:40:00.210 --> 01:40:02.030
planning process land use planning was
from North America so we're going to

01:40:02.030 --> 01:40:02.040
from North America so we're going to
 

01:40:02.040 --> 01:40:04.040
from North America so we're going to
have the gringos help us do the land use

01:40:04.040 --> 01:40:04.050
have the gringos help us do the land use
 

01:40:04.050 --> 01:40:05.660

none of them had ever done a land use
 

01:40:06.840 --> 01:40:09.500
none of them had ever done a land use
planning process and then I mean as I

01:40:09.500 --> 01:40:09.510
planning process and then I mean as I

so in summary I had really thought about

01:40:14.180 --> 01:40:14.190
so in summary I had really thought about
 

01:40:14.190 --> 01:40:15.800
so in summary I had really thought about

about participation and how we can
 

01:40:36.210 --> 01:40:39.350
about participation and how we can
actually engage it and enact it and then

natural Latin characteristics and so
people in month over there are very

02:03:09.940 --> 02:03:09.950
people in month over there are very
 

02:03:09.950 --> 02:03:11.620
people in month over there are very
conscious of that where people have

02:03:11.620 --> 02:03:11.630

distinctions diminish greatly but there

02:03:16.120 --> 02:03:16.130
distinctions diminish greatly but there
 

02:03:16.130 --> 02:03:17.800
distinctions diminish greatly but there
is a degree of separation that still

02:03:17.800 --> 02:03:17.810
is a degree of separation that still
 

02:03:17.810 --> 02:03:19.450
is a degree of separation that still
maintained and so those distinctions are

02:03:19.450 --> 02:03:19.460
maintained and so those distinctions are
 

02:03:19.460 --> 02:03:20.680
maintained and so those distinctions are
very much there in part of the community

02:03:20.680 --> 02:03:20.690
very much there in part of the community
 

02:03:20.690 --> 02:03:23.140

and of course Carnival has a deep roots

02:05:26.589 --> 02:05:26.599
and of course Carnival has a deep roots
 

02:05:26.599 --> 02:05:29.679
and of course Carnival has a deep roots
in in poor communities but but i would

02:05:29.679 --> 02:05:29.689
in in poor communities but but i would
 

02:05:29.689 --> 02:05:31.120
in in poor communities but but i would
say in practice the poor are largely

02:05:31.120 --> 02:05:31.130
say in practice the poor are largely
 

02:05:31.130 --> 02:05:32.560
say in practice the poor are largely
excluded from the beach and i've written

02:05:32.560 --> 02:05:32.570
excluded from the beach and i've written
 

02:05:32.570 --> 02:05:35.290
excluded from the beach and i've written
in great detail about that yeah the the

02:05:35.290 --> 02:05:35.300
in great detail about that yeah the the
 

02:05:35.300 --> 02:05:37.870

02:05:39.310 --> 02:05:39.320
about the beach is that its democratic
 

02:05:39.320 --> 02:05:40.899
about the beach is that its democratic
space and everyone is it's open to

02:05:40.899 --> 02:05:40.909
space and everyone is it's open to
 

02:05:40.909 --> 02:05:43.060
space and everyone is it's open to
everyone at the cape and I figure I've

02:05:43.060 --> 02:05:43.070
everyone at the cape and I figure I've
 

02:05:43.070 --> 02:05:44.859
everyone at the cape and I figure I've
written in detail about how people are

02:05:44.859 --> 02:05:44.869
written in detail about how people are
 

02:05:44.869 --> 02:05:46.270
written in detail about how people are
excluded in the beach actually in

02:05:46.270 --> 02:05:46.280
excluded in the beach actually in
 

02:05:46.280 --> 02:05:48.250
excluded in the beach actually in
practice so that's a good point I just

02:05:48.250 --> 02:05:48.260
practice so that's a good point I just
 

02:05:48.260 --> 02:05:55.280
practice so that's a good point I just
didn't quite know how to do this paper

first up yes what I'm trying to dress as

02:06:05.729 --> 02:06:05.739
first up yes what I'm trying to dress as
 

02:06:05.739 --> 02:06:08.100
first up yes what I'm trying to dress as
some of those intersections as I was

02:06:08.100 --> 02:06:08.110
some of those intersections as I was
 

02:06:08.110 --> 02:06:09.660
some of those intersections as I was
saying that the multiplicity of the

02:06:09.660 --> 02:06:09.670
saying that the multiplicity of the
 

02:06:09.670 --> 02:06:14.160
saying that the multiplicity of the
space or the convergence and yes i do

02:06:14.160 --> 02:06:14.170
space or the convergence and yes i do
 

02:06:14.170 --> 02:06:17.750
space or the convergence and yes i do
want to understand some of those

02:06:17.750 --> 02:06:17.760
want to understand some of those
 

02:06:17.760 --> 02:06:20.310
want to understand some of those
intersections in other places in my own

02:06:20.310 --> 02:06:20.320
intersections in other places in my own
 

02:06:20.320 --> 02:06:22.200

planning practice right now in San

02:06:22.200 --> 02:06:22.210
planning practice right now in San
 

02:06:22.210 --> 02:06:23.939
planning practice right now in San
Francisco I feel like we're going

02:06:23.939 --> 02:06:23.949
Francisco I feel like we're going
 

02:06:23.949 --> 02:06:26.970
Francisco I feel like we're going
through a process of displacement in

02:06:26.970 --> 02:06:26.980
through a process of displacement in
 

02:06:26.980 --> 02:06:30.630
through a process of displacement in
some form of Risa gregation and one of

02:06:30.630 --> 02:06:30.640
some form of Risa gregation and one of
 

02:06:30.640 --> 02:06:32.490
some form of Risa gregation and one of
the crucial elements to understand is

02:06:32.490 --> 02:06:32.500
the crucial elements to understand is
 

02:06:32.500 --> 02:06:35.520
the crucial elements to understand is
how can we address the planning of some

02:06:35.520 --> 02:06:35.530
how can we address the planning of some
 

02:06:35.530 --> 02:06:37.500
how can we address the planning of some
of these neighborhoods where we can

02:06:37.500 --> 02:06:37.510
of these neighborhoods where we can
 

02:06:37.510 --> 02:06:39.450
of these neighborhoods where we can
attract when we can where we can

02:06:39.450 --> 02:06:39.460
attract when we can where we can
 

02:06:39.460 --> 02:06:42.780
attract when we can where we can
recognize and accept and assume some

02:06:42.780 --> 02:06:42.790
recognize and accept and assume some
 

02:06:42.790 --> 02:06:44.850
recognize and accept and assume some
level of diversity and I feel like in

02:06:44.850 --> 02:06:44.860
level of diversity and I feel like in
 

02:06:44.860 --> 02:06:47.250
level of diversity and I feel like in
