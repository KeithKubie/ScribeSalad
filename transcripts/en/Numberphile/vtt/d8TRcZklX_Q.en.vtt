00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.620
MALE SPEAKER 1: The number I
want to talk about is 6,174.

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:06.740
And it doesn't seem to have
anything which is

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:08.295
unusual about it.

00:00:08.295 --> 00:00:11.970
But Kaprekar showed that if
you carry out a procedure,

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:16.400
which I'll outline for you, it
always comes to this number.

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:24.070
The conditions are that it has
to have four digits and these

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.040
four digits mustn't
be the same.

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.080
So you have to choose
maybe three the

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:30.230
same and one different.

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:31.100
Or all different.

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:32.119
It doesn't really matter.

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:35.780
But you don't choose 1,
1, 1, 1 or 0, 0, 0, 0.

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:41.180
So I asked you to choose one at
random and you said 9,218

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:42.850
is your starting point.

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:46.000
Now the first thing you do with
this is to put that in

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.500
the order, the largest number
first, then the next largest

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.870
number, then the next largest
number, and then the smallest.

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.200
And then the other way around.

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.690
1,289.

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.590
I've rearranged these digits
in the order, highest to

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:05.090
lowest, lowest to highest.

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:07.560
And then what you do is take
this away from that.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.520
And when you do that you get 2
and then you carry 1, 9 into--

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.080
and I get 8,532.

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.730
Now this is the new
number that you

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:16.380
put into this machine.

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.940
You arrange that in order with
the highest to lowest, which

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.750
it turns out to be right
straight away, and then the

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.630
other way around, 2,358.

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.580
And you take one away
from the other.

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.930
And there we are, 6,174.

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.350
So you've been really kind to me
because I've only had to go

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.920
through this iteration twice
and I get to the number.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.150
Well if I'd got to this number
and I do it again I would

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:45.420
have, let me see, 7,641.

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.620
I've got to get this right.

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:51.480
And then 1,467.

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.280
And I take this away
from that.

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.640
And I get back to 6,174.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.180
And if I were to do that again,
I would get this and

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:58.980
then that and that.

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:00.290
And it would go on forever.

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:04.360
The whole thing with this
procedure always converges,

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:05.970
always ends up with
this number.

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:08.699
And when it's got to this
number, it's stuck in a

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:12.310
perpetual loop that will always
bring you this number.

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.450
MALE SPEAKER 2: Any four digit
number is going to?

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.020
MALE SPEAKER 1: You can't have
1,111 because if you rearrange

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:21.490
that into the other order,
you get 0,000.

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:24.900
It doesn't work if all the
numbers here are the same.

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.080
All zeros, nines, whatever.

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.560
That would not work.

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.630
But anything other than
that, it's going to

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.490
converge to this number.

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:35.150
This is the one that's known as
the Kaprekar constant, if

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:36.840
you want to look it
up on Google.

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.800
That's the number that really
is associated with this work

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.200
of an Indian mathematician, who
must have had more time on

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.980
his hands than anybody else,
if he's going to be playing

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.760
with numbers to try and find
something like this.

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.370
But that's what mathematicians
do.

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:51.930
And I think it's beautiful.

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.155
MALE SPEAKER 2: I see you've
got some spare

00:02:53.155 --> 00:02:54.060
room on your paper.

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.890
I'm going to give you another
random four digit number and

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:57.730
let's see if it works.

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.490
I'm going to make this up
off the top of my head.

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:00.180
MALE SPEAKER 1: You haven't
got anything on

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.720
the top of your head.

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.811
But that's a wig, isn't it?

00:03:03.811 --> 00:03:06.120
MALE SPEAKER 2: 2,984.

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.570
MALE SPEAKER 1: 2,984.

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:12.050
So I have to first put it in the
order of the numbers and

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:16.241
then change them around and take
one away from the other.

00:03:16.241 --> 00:03:17.491
One.

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:21.790
One.

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:22.700
Two.

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.970
I've got the Kaprekar number
in three goes.

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.740
So you just chose one at random
and it took three goes

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:30.270
to get to it.

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:32.700
It's very appealing.

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.040
Not everything has to
be useful to be

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.430
appealing and fun.

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:37.680
And this seems to be fun.
