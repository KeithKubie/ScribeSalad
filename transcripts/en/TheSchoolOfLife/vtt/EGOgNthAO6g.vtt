00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:06.120
It can at points be hard to

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.680
tell whether what we are saying is really
of any interest to those we are addressing.

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:16.859
Few people – other than our partner in a
bad mood or our adolescent child – will

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:22.900
ever directly cut us short and announce that
they find us dull. It is as a result all too

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:28.769
easy to develop an impression of our own compelling
nature. If we were to ask our interlocutor

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:34.989
Am I boring you?, we can be certain that the
one answer we would never receive is: Well,

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:40.480
since you ask, yes you are rather. If we choose
to wait until people fall asleep while we’re

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:45.031
recounting an anecdote or check their phone
as we get to the punchline of our joke, it

00:00:45.031 --> 00:00:50.789
will be too late. Our reputation as a windbag
will long ago have been sealed.

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.000
Fortunately, most of what people need to tell

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.980
us does not have to be directly stated; the
evolution of a civilisation can be measured

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:06.810
by the scope of its dictionary of unsaid signals.
The clue to another’s interest lies not

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:13.500
in their overt declarations but in their degree
of responsiveness to our words. We can gauge

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:20.329
interest by studying how closely and logically
another’s questions follow on from our statements;

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:26.360
how fast their replies come; how invested
they seem in their emphases; whether their

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:32.120
eyes meet ours when we stress a point; and
the degree of elasticity and benevolence in

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:38.711
their smile. To a trained observer, an urgent
cry – ‘I need to go to bed now’ – can

00:01:38.711 --> 00:01:44.360
be communicated by nothing more brutal or
direct than a gaze at the overhead smoke alarm

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:50.290
that is held a fraction too long or a ‘That’s
wonderful’ that lacks a minute but critical

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:57.680
dose of wonder. It is mostly easy enough to
note the cues; when we ignore them, it isn’t

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.460
that we aren’t receiving them, but that
we are somehow opting not to register them

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.930
– and we are not doing so for a poignant
reason: because we cannot bear to imagine

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:14.300
that we might be boring, because the idea
of not belonging sufficiently deeply in another’s

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:20.890
life is untenable; because we are unreconciled
to the fundamental loneliness of existence

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:26.459
and the tragic disjuncture between what we
want from others and what they may be prepared

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:35.000
to provide. We have grown deaf from the rigidity
of our need not from any failure of sensitivity.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.650
Somewhere the idea of not pleasing someone
conversationally has turned from a risk into

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:47.650
a catastrophe that must be manically warded
off. We become insistent and wilfully oblivious;

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.840
we give up seeking to delight and settle instead
on the more modest hope of not being actively

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:59.560
thrown out. The insult to our self-love that
we read into another’s bored reaction feels

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:05.110
too great, and our resources to deal with
it too slim for us to take in the meaning

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:10.951
of the long pauses and wandering eyes. We
overlook the cues because what they indicate

00:03:10.951 --> 00:03:15.890
to our unconscious minds isn’t the relatively
innocuous thought that the other wants to

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:22.290
go to bed; they become embroiled in a deeper
story about our self-worth: they become indicators

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:27.760
that we are fundamentally displeasing, that
we deserve our isolation, that we are hateful

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:34.420
wretches. The best guarantee of not boring
others is – therefore – the development

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:42.159
of an internal robustness that can allow us
to withstand the thought of our tedious aspects.

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:46.959
The interesting person can acknowledge that
losing someone’s attention is a setback

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:49.870
not a sign of damnation.

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:55.060
To develop a more benevolent picture of what
it means occasionally to bore, it can help

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:00.280
to study the responses of parents to their
small children, for there are no better examples

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:07.160
of the easy coexistence of boredom with love.
To a parent, their four-year-old child will

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:12.200
be at once the most loveable creature they
have ever met – and, by a long way, especially

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:18.660
in their conversation, the most tedious. Even
outside of parenthood, we are all endowed

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:24.450
with surprisingly rich capacities to love
someone and at the same time to find them

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:30.541
extremely wearing. It does not, as the bore
mistakenly ends up thinking, need to be a

00:04:30.541 --> 00:04:39.100
choice between love or boredom. To skirt the
danger of being a full-blown bore, we should

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:44.470
foster the inner courage to imagine that we
might sometimes, without anything too awful

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:49.920
being meant by this, be such a thing.

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:57.440
