00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:05.090
In what seems like the stuff of Frankenstein,
scientists are synthesizing artificial life.

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:09.680
But why mess with nature, what benefit could
there possibly be?

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:13.160
Hello DNA-enthusiasts.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.039
Lissette here for Dnews.

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:18.650
Scientists are creating artificial life.

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.570
What some are doing is freakishly similar
to how Frankenstein assembled his monster

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:27.650
with different pieces - but in their cases,
instead of using random body parts and electricity

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:32.890
to spring creatures to life - scientists are
using empty cells and chromosomes and infusing

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.500
them with fungal and bacterial life.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.680
And instead of ending up with one monster,
they end up with many tiny creations.

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:40.680
Why?

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.530
Because the payoff of this artificial life
can be huge.

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.630
Geneticists use various processes to construct
synthetic life.

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:52.020
In one example published in Science in 2008,
researchers managed to synthesize a mycoplasma

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.120
- that’s a type of bacteria.

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.320
Scientists achieved this by first breaking
down the mycoplasma’s original genome into

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.550
101 pieces, which they called “cassettes”.

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:06.249
Then to create a new artificial form of the
bacteria, they took 1 to 4 of these cassettes

00:01:06.249 --> 00:01:11.600
and inserted them into a host bacteria’s
chromosome: either E.Coli or S. cerevisiae

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.530
aka brewer’s yeast.

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.349
The process enabled researchers to create
many different combinations of artificial

00:01:17.349 --> 00:01:18.509
bacterial life.

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.799
At the time, this was a huge landmark achievement,
but since then, scientists have taken Franken-life

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:27.819
to the next level; that’s not to say the
life they created was more complex.

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:30.039
In fact, quite the opposite.

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:34.491
Just recently, scientists at the J Craig Venter
Institute were able to synthesize a Mycoplasma

00:01:34.491 --> 00:01:40.060
bacterium with an incredibly small genome
just 473 genes.

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.329
To put that number into perspective a human
has about 25,000 genes.

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:49.349
Now it may seem futile for researchers to
spend so much time creating such a simple

00:01:49.349 --> 00:01:54.539
organism, but this tiny artificial bacterium
can actually tell us a lot about which genes

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:56.969
are considered the building blocks of life.

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:00.670
When you have an organism with a large genome,
it’s incredibly difficult to understand

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.909
the role of each individual gene.

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:07.829
So this small synthesized genome can help
scientists isolate specific genes that they

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.690
may want to turn on or off to see what happens.

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.980
If the cell dies when one particular gene
is taken out, then scientists know that gene

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.640
is essential for life.

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.161
What’s more, because unlike human life,
these organisms can self replicate, scientists

00:02:22.161 --> 00:02:25.380
can have a slew of these organisms to make
comparisons.

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:29.840
Now, potentially scientists can use these
techniques to manipulate genes - change them

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.130
in some way - or introduce foreign genes into
an organism.

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:39.099
Which is why some are worried that synthesizing
artificial life is too much like playing god.

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:44.489
However, some scientists believe that synthetic
bacterial life can have significant benefits.

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:49.000
In addition to advancing gene editing techniques
and drug development; it could even help us

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.629
find new ways to use our own immune system
to fight off disease.

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:58.000
But before that happens, there are some questions
that remain to be answered, like whether the

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.109
chromosomes present in synthesized bacterial
cells contain the entire spectrum of genes...

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:07.709
the concern here is that these basic genomes
may not really be representative of the building

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:09.629
blocks that make up our own DNA.

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:14.530
Still, if we can better understand life’s
building blocks, think of what could be accomplished….we

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:19.170
could figure out what is causing alzheimer’s
disease, what feeds our cells, what influences

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.660
our cognitive abilities…the possibilities
are endless.
