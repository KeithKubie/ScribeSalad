00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.810
Period cramps getting you down?

00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:04.490
Just chug some oil!

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:12.551
Hey guys, Tara here for Dnews - with a new
study about everyone's favorite topic, period

00:00:12.551 --> 00:00:13.551
cramps.

00:00:13.551 --> 00:00:16.550
And if you're a guy watching this - don't
switch off just yet, because some day - you

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.210
WILL have to deal with a girl who has cramps
- and when that day comes, you'll be thanking

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:21.980
yourself for watching this episode.

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:26.250
The Caspian Journal of Internal Medicine published
a study this week, showing that thyme oil

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.110
- is a safer and more effective painkiller
for cramps than ibuprofen.

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:31.110
Who knew?

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:35.670
Researchers looked at 84 women with primary
Dysmenorrhea - which is the medical term for

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.629
painful menstrual cramps - and separated them
into 3 treatment groups.

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:45.769
The first group, received 200mg of ibuprofen
as well as 25 drops of a placebo essential

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:48.379
oil, at the first onset of cramps.

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:54.149
The second group was treated with 25 drops
of thyme essential oil and a placebo capsule.

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.110
And the third group was given both a placebo
capsule and 25 drops of placebo oil.

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:04.150
They were then asked to rate their pain - using
the visual analogue scale - both before the

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.410
treatment, and during the treatment - for
two consecutive cycles.

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:11.860
Turns out, the women treated with thyme oil
- experienced slightly more pain relief over

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.300
time, than the women taking ibuprofen - both
of which were more effective than the placebo

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:17.300
treatment.

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:21.540
What's more, is that the women taking the
ibuprofen, reported a decrease in pain relief

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.590
during their second monthly cycle.

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.790
While the thyme oil group, reported even greater
pain relief in the second month of use than

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:29.890
in the first.

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.590
Researchers say this is because the body builds
up a tolerance to pharmaceutical drugs, but

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.170
not to things like thyme oil - which are recognized
by the body.

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.710
So not only does thyme oil provide relief
for longer - it also doesn't carry the same

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.850
set of risks as ibuprofen, which can cause
widespread inflammation and other health problems

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.790
- even in the short term.

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.140
Because of those side effects, people have
begun seeking out more natural methods for

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.460
pain relief - and thyme oil in particular,
has been known to relieve both pain and muscle

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:58.460
spasms.

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.610
It contains high amounts of Carvacrol - which
is an organic compound that inhibits the growth

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.640
of bacteria, and acts as a natural anti-inflammatory.

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:11.299
A similar study conducted in South Korea in
2012, also found that clary sage, marjoram,

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:17.439
cinnamon, ginger, and geranium oil - accompanied
by an abdomen massage - were also more effective

00:02:17.439 --> 00:02:20.379
in alleviating menstrual cramps, than a dose
of tylenol.

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:24.849
So the next time it's that "time of the month"
- try dropping some thyme oil into your tea,

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:26.590
instead of popping a pill.

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.859
The only caution experts give, is to make
sure you get a good quality, therapeutic grade

00:02:30.859 --> 00:02:31.859
oil.

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:34.360
MAN science is amazing - and it gets better
every day.

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.609
If you agree, then you ought to check out
IFLS with Elise Andrew, where she explores

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:39.989
all things trending in science.

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:44.540
There are new episodes every week, featuring
fascinating stories related chemistry, health,

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.030
astronomy and beyond.

00:02:46.030 --> 00:03:02.170
Including stuff 
like this.

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.680
Guess THEY don't have to worry about menstrual
cramps, huh?

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:05.790
Lucky bastards.

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.189
