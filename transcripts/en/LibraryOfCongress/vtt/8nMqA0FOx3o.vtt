00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:18.590
&gt;&gt; Matthew Barton: All right.

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:19.890
Good afternoon.

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.190
Welcome to the Library
of Congress.

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:22.490
My name is Matthew Barton.

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.330
I'm the Curator of the
Recorded Sounds section.

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.650
Most of the time, I'm down
at the National Audio Visual

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.480
Conservation Center in
Culpepper, Virginia,

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:36.620
about 60 miles south,
oh, southwest of here.

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:37.920
But, it's nice to get up here.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.240
I used to work in this building,
though I get lost here now.

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:45.130
Any time I get an audience here,
though, I like to ask who's here

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:46.750
for the first time in
the Library of Congress.

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:48.200
Anybody? Okay.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.500
A few. Okay.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.850
Yeah. Welcome.

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.470
Please come back soon,
and don't be a stranger.

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:55.890
It's here for you.

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:02.920
So, this event, I
can't take much credit

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.470
for helping to put it together.

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.310
It was very much the brain child
of Allison and Tony from the

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:10.610
from the Studs Terkel Archive,

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.180
and I'll introduce
everybody in a moment.

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:17.110
I wanted to say something,
though, about the project

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:21.300
that we're working on with the
Studs Terkel Archive in Chicago.

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.240
This began a little
over seven years ago.

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.310
Studs Terkel's recorded
broadcast legacy amounts

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.790
to about 7000 reels
of tape over 45 years.

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.490
And, I'm not going to
go all technical on you,

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.510
but I'll just say that as
a recorded sound archivist,

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:41.020
that period of time
and that range

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.370
of tape covers pretty much
all of the archival problems

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:47.540
that you can have with tape.

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.990
But, boy, is it ever worth it.

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.390
You know, and at this
point, we're about 70%

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:55.910
through with the processing,

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:59.890
and we're about 60%
digitally preserved.

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.560
That is, 60% of those
7000 files,

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.350
over 4000 of them
have been digitized.

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.010
And, you can hear
them downstairs

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:09.310
if you want to before you leave.

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.370
Go down to LM119,
LM119 in this building.

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:14.700
Karen Fishman our Head

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.070
of Reference should
be back there by then.

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:21.890
[laughs] And, we'll set you
up with a pair of headphones,

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:23.540
and you can listen
to Studs Terkel.

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.330
I particularly recommend
that you listen

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.870
to Studs Terkel's
interview with Eliot Asinof,

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.970
author of "Eight Men Out".

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:35.380
I just say a word
or two generally

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:36.820
about audio preservation.

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:38.900
I kind of evangelize for it

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.950
because I feel it's a neglected
research resource and, you know,

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.620
just a neglected treasure,
countless treasures, really.

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:53.670
And, I was fortunate enough
to know Studs Terkel slightly

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.620
in that I worked for Alan Lomax,
one of his very good friends,

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.170
and met Studs through
Alan and then later,

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:03.390
after Alan had retired due
to a series of strokes,

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.880
the archive was on the same
floor of a building in New York

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.650
with Studs' publisher,
New Press.

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.340
And, Studs would visit
and always ask about Alan,

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.340
and one time, I actually
got to bring the two

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:14.930
of them together again.

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:16.740
Really a lovely moment.

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:19.740
Alan had aphasia, had
difficulty speaking, but his,

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:21.720
the joy was just so palpable.

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.020
It was really wonderful to be
together with the two of them.

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:30.340
And, we're very fortunate
to have had Studs Terkel

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.030
with us for so very long.

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:34.830
We're very fortunate
that he saw fit

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:37.660
to archive what he was
doing in the first place.

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:38.960
Many people don't.

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:42.990
Even, no matter how seriously
they take their work in radio.

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:44.290
It's an ephemeral thing.

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.990
You finish with it, and
you're on to the next program.

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:52.700
And, I brought with me, from
very late in Studs' life,

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.390
"Touch and Go", this
wonderful memoir.

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:57.610
Got a very short passage to read
here, but it'll give you an idea

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:01.050
of the things that are lost but
the things that can be saved.

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:04.370
He's talking about the early
1950s when he's at a station,

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:08.930
another Chicago station, not
WFMT where he [inaudible].

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:12.820
And, he says, "I remember
interviewing Battling Nelson.

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:15.080
He was the lightweight
champion way back.

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:18.510
We're talking about 1906 during
the San Francisco earthquake.

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:20.990
He was there, giving money
to earthquake victims.

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:24.330
A guy tips me off he's in
Chicago and where to find him.

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:29.050
Battling Nelson is in an seedy,
40 watt bulb Ontario Hotel room.

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:31.110
I went with Hansen the engineer.

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:33.570
Nelson's wife is cackling
as the old boy tries

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:36.980
to remember certain events
in his life, glory moments.

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:39.560
Old Bat has a tremendous
sheaf of papers and a ton

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.130
of scrapbooks, photos.

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:44.560
Nelson, the Durable Dane
and the King of Denmark,

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.300
etc. He opens it up,
and there are headlines.

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.270
And, he talks, and
there's his voice.

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:51.790
Remember, he's from 1908, 1910,

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:54.030
the kind of guy Hemingway
wrote about.

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:57.100
After Red Quinlan left,
the new head dumped me.

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:59.830
He did say, 'These tapes
are yours if you want them.'

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:01.460
I didn't take them.

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:03.280
Should have.

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:07.020
Who else would, who the hell
else would have Battling

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:09.340
Nelson's voice today?"

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:11.840
So, thankfully, we
don't have that voice,

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:13.460
but we have so many others.

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:18.100
And, will you join me please in
welcoming this wonderful panel.

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:20.370
We have Alison Schein Holmes,

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:23.110
archivist the Studs
Terkel Archive.

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:26.000
Tony Macalus, Director
of the same archive.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.630
Derek Goldman, drama teacher
at Georgetown University.

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:33.950
David Strathairn,
actor, Oscar nominee

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:35.670
and star of "Eight Men Out".

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:39.510
And, John Sayles, Director
of "Eight Men Out".

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:47.500
[ Applause ]

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:53.890
&gt;&gt; Tony Macalus: So,
thank you all for coming.

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:56.030
We're going to dive
into Studs, baseball,

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:57.580
and America in just
a few minutes.

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:59.260
But, first, we're going to
give you just a little more

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:03.080
background on this magnificent
thing called the Studs Terkel

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:04.380
Radio Archive.

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:06.150
And so, first of all, thank
you to the Library of Congress

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:07.510
because this would
not be happening

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:10.730
without all the amazing
digitizing.

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:14.580
The archive is being managed
by Studs' old radio home WFMT

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:18.170
in Chicago and the
Chicago History Museum

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:20.280
in a really special partnership.

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:22.280
And, of course, we'd
also particularly want

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:24.170
to think the National
Endowment for the Humanities

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:27.640
which has given really critical
support for this project

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:28.990
at a couple of key junctures.

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:33.620
And, especially give a call out
thanks to Jon Parrish Peede,

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:36.100
the Chairman of NEH,
David Weinstein,

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:38.530
Program Officer who's
been a great source

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:40.130
of advice and wisdom.

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:42.950
So, quickly, I'll tell you what
we've got planned for today.

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:44.250
We could go on into great detail

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:45.890
into what is the Studs
Terkel Radio Archive.

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:48.050
We're going to give you just a
little bit of that, but then,

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:50.260
we're going to watch
come clips of Studs,

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:51.560
see a little bit
of "Eight Men Out".

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:54.720
Here's some readings, theatrical
brought to life, and a few clips

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:57.780
from Studs' program
specifically on baseball.

00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:00.370
But, I'll mention, and
then my colleague, Allison,

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:03.400
will join to talk a little
more about what the archive is.

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:05.170
But, essentially,
when Studs retired

00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:07.420
from his daily radio
show in 1997, again,

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:12.380
he left behind this trove of
tapes to Chicago History Museum.

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:14.940
The Library of Congress began
their work a little more

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:17.620
than a decade later, and
this History Museum came back

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:21.050
to Studs' old radio home,
now five years ago to say,

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:22.510
"Do you have any thoughts on how

00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:24.400
to make all this
accessible to the world?"

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:26.850
It's one thing to have
tapes even online,

00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:30.510
but how to make them appealing,
how to make a new generation

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:31.960
of listeners want
to find out what's

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:33.370
in there and listen to them.

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:36.180
And so, a long process
began, with help from the NEH

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:38.650
and others, of building
this site.

00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:41.570
And then, just over a month and
a half ago, on Studs' birthday,

00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:45.230
May 16th, the whole thing
went live at studsterkel.org.

00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:47.480
And so, with beautiful
photography.

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:49.840
There'll be a remixing
tool coming out soon

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:52.700
where people can go
in and remix audio,

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:54.760
but also education programs
we'll talk a bit more

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:56.060
about in a second.

00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:58.800
A brand new podcast coming
out in October called

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:00.990
"Bug House Square"
with Eve Ewing,

00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:04.260
hosted by a phenomenal
young poet, scholar,

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:08.040
activist who will bring all
this to a new generation.

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:10.900
But, today, we're here
specifically talking about Studs

00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:12.860
and baseball, and the
archive is divided

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:15.010
into about 60 categories,
and really,

00:08:15.010 --> 00:08:17.760
we could do a similar event on
each one of those categories.

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:20.430
It could be Studs and
jazz or Studs and feminism

00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:22.860
or Studs and World War II.

00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:24.370
But, today, we're
doing baseball,

00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:26.920
in part because of the fantastic
exhibit across the street,

00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:29.200
which, if you haven't seen,
I definitely suggest going

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:30.500
over right after this.

00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:34.130
But, also, Studs was a
deep lover of baseball

00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:36.860
and all the cultural
surroundings of it,

00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:41.090
the long conversation,
the understanding,

00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:44.130
the nuances of the game,
and one of the reasons

00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:47.560
that he had this role in
John's film I think was

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:49.470
because he was a
deep baseball lover.

00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:52.200
But, I just to end my
portion and then bring Allison

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:54.010
up for a bit of this to
say that Studs, though,

00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:55.530
when he was a kid,
didn't play baseball.

00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:58.040
He was a, when he was in
Chicago, he actually was born

00:08:58.040 --> 00:08:59.730
in New York but moved to
Chicago when he was eight.

00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:02.260
And, he had asthma and
other health problems.

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:05.700
And so, he spent a couple of
summers in a kind of sanitarium

00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:09.760
on Lake Michigan on the Michigan
side listening to the radio.

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:12.330
And, that's when he first
discovered politics and things

00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:15.150
like opera and other music,
sitting there in bed, you know,

00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:17.640
listening to things, listening
to baseball games as well,

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:23.720
listening to the Republican
Democratic convention in 1920.

00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:27.270
And so, Studs, despite his love
of baseball, never really got

00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:31.180
to play baseball until
he was 90 years old.

00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:33.400
And, I'll tell you that story
at the end of the whole event.

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:34.700
But, you got to stick
around to find

00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:38.290
out about Studs' major league
baseball debut at the age of 90.

00:09:38.290 --> 00:09:40.100
But, first, Allison, do
you want to talk a bit

00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:42.780
about some of the facets of the.

00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:44.080
&gt;&gt; Allison Schein Holmes: Sure.

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:45.380
&gt;&gt; Tony Macalus: The archive?

00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:47.170
And, I can jump in.

00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:48.560
&gt;&gt; Allison Schein
Holmes: Maybe I can.

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:50.020
There we go.

00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:51.320
Thanks, Tony.

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:52.890
Oh. All right.

00:09:52.890 --> 00:09:55.330
Just a few quick facts
because Tony pretty much

00:09:55.330 --> 00:09:56.630
covered everything.

00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:58.780
When you do go to
studsterkel.org,

00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:01.160
please know that there are a
few ways that you can engage

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:05.760
in deeper level than typical
radio archives is that you,

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:09.510
we've got about 164 programs
currently transcribed

00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:11.160
with more coming down the pike.

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:13.810
And, while transcription
is wonderful and great,

00:10:13.810 --> 00:10:16.000
what you can also
do is share portions

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.460
of the most meaningful bits
across social media platforms

00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:22.800
such as Facebook and Twitter
that will allow people

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:25.460
to come right back to that
exact moment that you were just

00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:28.330
so excited about you
had to tell everyone.

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:31.390
Also, if you are an educator
or know some educators

00:10:31.390 --> 00:10:34.720
that are looking for some
exciting content to use

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:37.410
to enhance their
current lesson plans,

00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:41.100
we do have a classroom
section of studsterkel.org

00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:46.070
where we currently have three
different curriculum already put

00:10:46.070 --> 00:10:49.710
together, lesson plans, audio,
everything, right there ready

00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:52.590
for you to go or your
fellow educators,

00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:55.040
to go into really
have some fun with.

00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:57.420
There's learning based ones,
and then there's project.

00:10:57.420 --> 00:10:58.720
They're all learning.

00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:00.020
There's project based ones

00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:03.660
that really will help
give students a chance

00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:07.250
to have a deeper connection to
history that sometimes we lose

00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:11.110
when we're reading it but can
definitely hear it and feel it

00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:14.660
when you hear the conversations
with members of [inaudible],

00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:18.590
with women's rights and
labor rights movements.

00:11:18.590 --> 00:11:22.090
So, anyway, we implore
you to go to the website.

00:11:22.090 --> 00:11:23.390
Have fun with it.

00:11:23.390 --> 00:11:25.390
Enjoy. We are constantly
adding to it.

00:11:25.390 --> 00:11:29.950
As Matthew said, they're
continuing the digitization,

00:11:29.950 --> 00:11:31.400
so we will be adding more there.

00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:33.170
And, if there's something
that you're interested in

00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:35.630
and you don't see, feel
free to drop me an email,

00:11:35.630 --> 00:11:37.230
and we'll see what
we can do for you.

00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:40.610
So, welcome, and I hope you
have fun listening to the talk

00:11:40.610 --> 00:11:42.430
on baseball and Studs.

00:11:42.430 --> 00:11:43.730
Derek?

00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:45.030
&gt;&gt; Matthew Barton: Great.

00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:46.330
&gt;&gt; Derek Goldman: Great.

00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:47.630
&gt;&gt; Tony Macalus:
Just a quick note.

00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:48.930
The program is probably
going to last about an hour

00:11:48.930 --> 00:11:50.230
and 20 minutes, something
like that, and we're going

00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:51.530
to leave lots of space
at the end for questions

00:11:51.530 --> 00:11:52.830
and answers on any
of the topics.

00:11:52.830 --> 00:11:54.530
So, to John and David
and others.

00:11:54.530 --> 00:11:56.240
So, keep questions in mind.

00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:58.050
We're eager to hear some
feedback from you all.

00:11:58.050 --> 00:11:59.750
All right.

00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:01.050
&gt;&gt; Derek Goldman: Great.

00:12:01.050 --> 00:12:02.350
Hi, everybody.

00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:03.750
Can you hear me okay?

00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:07.680
Great. Yes, as Tony mentioned,
my name I'd Derek Goldman.

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:12.020
I'm very, I can't imagine,
for me, getting to talk

00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:15.610
about Studs is one of my great
heroes and who I felt lucky

00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:18.330
to get to spend some time with
towards the end of his life

00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:22.780
and to talk about baseball
and to be among heroes of mine

00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:25.670
like John and David who
has also become a friend

00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:26.970
and collaborator.

00:12:26.970 --> 00:12:31.450
But, who I still think
of as a hero of mine.

00:12:31.450 --> 00:12:36.000
So, it's, these are my favorite
topics, and I just will share.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.250
I think I'm going to do
the least of the talking,

00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:43.060
but I wanted to just
share a little bit

00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:45.680
about how my relationship

00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:50.660
with Studs felt particularly
entwined with baseball.

00:12:50.660 --> 00:12:52.680
And, as someone who's
been a, like, lifelong,

00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:55.920
die hard baseball fan, it might
open up just to sort of put

00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:59.410
on the table a couple of themes
of, like, how, at least for me,

00:12:59.410 --> 00:13:01.540
and I felt like I
shared this with Studs,

00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:06.200
how the beautiful seriousness
of everything baseball.

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:07.850
I'll put it that way.

00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:12.280
So, I was getting to know Studs
in the last decade of his life

00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:13.950
in the '90s in Chicago.

00:13:13.950 --> 00:13:16.690
I'm a playwright and theater
maker and had the opportunity

00:13:16.690 --> 00:13:18.850
to write a play about
the Haymarket Riots

00:13:18.850 --> 00:13:21.610
at Steppenwolf Theatre,
and Studs was sort

00:13:21.610 --> 00:13:22.910
of introduced to Studs.

00:13:22.910 --> 00:13:27.370
And, he became the kind of
go to labor historian expert,

00:13:27.370 --> 00:13:29.590
you know, who couldn't have a
better person in the history

00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:33.250
of the world, I felt to,
but I got to spend some time

00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:35.510
with him getting to know him as
we were developing that play.

00:13:35.510 --> 00:13:38.870
And, that was an interesting
time in the baseball world

00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:41.530
because it was the mid to late
'90s, and at least in Chicago,

00:13:41.530 --> 00:13:47.310
Sammy Sosa was, along with
Mark McGuire, informed,

00:13:47.310 --> 00:13:51.600
helped by various substances
as we now know and tarnished

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:55.700
by various substances
were shattering records.

00:13:55.700 --> 00:14:00.930
And, that was a big part of the
fodder for our time together

00:14:00.930 --> 00:14:05.910
and our conversations even in
that, in those early moments.

00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:08.950
And, I remember him using
expressions like, you know,

00:14:08.950 --> 00:14:11.220
"Skilled craftsmen
plying their trade."

00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:12.940
You know, talking,
kind of, at that point,

00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:15.400
I think ironically
also in a certain way

00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:17.720
about the way baseball
had changed.

00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:19.070
But, it was a source
of connection,

00:14:19.070 --> 00:14:22.550
and I grew up in Boston
very near Fenway Park

00:14:22.550 --> 00:14:25.110
as a lifelong, die
hard Red Sox fan.

00:14:25.110 --> 00:14:26.410
And, this was still the period

00:14:26.410 --> 00:14:30.030
where neither the Red Sox nor
the Cubs had broken their sort

00:14:30.030 --> 00:14:32.020
of almost century long curse.

00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:34.210
And, they were sort of,
as many of you know, very,

00:14:34.210 --> 00:14:38.170
kind of twined franchises
that had a kind of empathy

00:14:38.170 --> 00:14:40.640
across the American and
the National League.

00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:50.380
So, I ended up having the chance
to adapt and direct Studs' book

00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:54.270
"Will the Circle be Unbroken"
for, which deals with death

00:14:54.270 --> 00:14:56.760
and mortality and loss.

00:14:56.760 --> 00:14:58.420
And, we were developing

00:14:58.420 --> 00:15:03.980
that project a couple
years later in 2003.

00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:06.970
And, if anyone remember
the 2003 baseball season,

00:15:06.970 --> 00:15:09.070
it was a particularly
interesting season

00:15:09.070 --> 00:15:11.180
to be thinking about the
chances of the Red Sox

00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:15.120
and the Cubs breaking
their respective curses.

00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:20.550
In fact, what happened
is in October in a sort

00:15:20.550 --> 00:15:23.200
of painfully twinned symmetry,

00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:27.950
the two teams were
both five outs away

00:15:27.950 --> 00:15:29.280
from making the World Series.

00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:32.570
So, we spent a lot of that year
talking about the possibility

00:15:32.570 --> 00:15:35.070
of a Red Sox Cubs World
Series which was very real.

00:15:35.070 --> 00:15:39.320
They both had three run
leads with five outs away

00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:40.640
from making the World Series.

00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:42.490
And, neither team made it.

00:15:42.490 --> 00:15:46.460
The Cubs' probably
most infamous moment

00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:48.870
in franchise history
happened in game six

00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:52.130
when a fan named Steve Bartman
reached over and interfered

00:15:52.130 --> 00:15:56.860
with left fielder Moisés
Alou and opened the door

00:15:56.860 --> 00:15:59.870
for the Florida Marlins
to come back.

00:15:59.870 --> 00:16:02.470
And, for the Red Sox,
two nights later,

00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:08.030
manager Grady Little left Pedro
Martinez in longer than any,

00:16:08.030 --> 00:16:10.780
you know, as the whole Red Sox
nation screamed, "Take him out.

00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:12.080
Take him out.

00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:13.380
He has nothing left."

00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:15.020
And, Little, at the time, said,

00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:17.160
"That's probably it
for me as a manager."

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:20.090
And, of course, he was correct.

00:16:20.090 --> 00:16:24.960
And, the Red Sox went on to lose
to the Yankees in game seven

00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:28.640
when Aaron Boone, now the Red
Sox manager, hit a homerun off

00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:30.210
of Tim Wakefield to send them

00:16:30.210 --> 00:16:32.990
against the Marlins
to the World Series.

00:16:32.990 --> 00:16:38.250
So, the following year, the Red
Sox actually broke the 86 year

00:16:38.250 --> 00:16:41.530
old curse, and in fact, just
symmetry that I think is,

00:16:41.530 --> 00:16:42.830
you know, whatever it means.

00:16:42.830 --> 00:16:46.930
October 17, 2004 was the
first public performance

00:16:46.930 --> 00:16:49.640
of "Will the Circle be
Unbroken" at Steppenwolf Theatre

00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:51.200
which was a very moving occasion

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:53.150
with Studs there
and in attendance.

00:16:53.150 --> 00:16:58.150
And, it, as we entered the
party that night at the place

00:16:58.150 --> 00:16:59.700
where the post show party was,

00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:04.390
David Ortiz hit a 12th
inning homerun in game four

00:17:04.390 --> 00:17:07.050
against the Yankees which,
in what's now famously known

00:17:07.050 --> 00:17:09.250
by Red Sox as sort of
the Dave Roberts game.

00:17:09.250 --> 00:17:13.330
To sort of send the Red Sox
then won the next three games

00:17:13.330 --> 00:17:15.680
and went on to, it was the
first time a team had come back

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:18.100
from 3-0 to make
the World Series,

00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:20.110
and they won the
World Series in 2004.

00:17:20.110 --> 00:17:24.080
So, that's some of the, and
Studs and I, you know, we shared

00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:25.380
and talked about this.

00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:27.860
We were living this
connected to that project.

00:17:27.860 --> 00:17:31.960
So, I'm going to just share a
couple of very quick thoughts

00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:34.930
that I think may resonate
through the theme of a couple

00:17:34.930 --> 00:17:38.200
of the readings that David and
I have picked from the sort

00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:42.890
of [inaudible] of Studs things
that you'll hear that feel to me

00:17:42.890 --> 00:17:48.140
like they speak to why I feel
like my love and reverence

00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:50.850
for Studs Terkel is
so tied to my love

00:17:50.850 --> 00:17:53.100
and feelings about baseball.

00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:56.740
Tony eluded to one thing already
which is maybe the most obvious

00:17:56.740 --> 00:18:00.570
which is that baseball is truly
a conversationalists game.

00:18:00.570 --> 00:18:04.060
The role of the vernacular
and of the, you know,

00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:07.070
from the vendors to the
kind of rhythm of the game

00:18:07.070 --> 00:18:09.700
and the way it opens
conversation.

00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:12.350
The nicknames that have
existed across time.

00:18:12.350 --> 00:18:13.760
I just think it's just
like there's something

00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:18.050
about the oral nature of the
game the fans' role in that

00:18:18.050 --> 00:18:21.520
and the relationship to time
that's unique to baseball.

00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:24.860
Another thing that Studs,
it's a theme that comes

00:18:24.860 --> 00:18:26.380
out a little bit in what
we're going to hear,

00:18:26.380 --> 00:18:29.530
but I think it's very deeply
Studs is baseball has a really

00:18:29.530 --> 00:18:32.720
interesting relationship
between success and failure.

00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:37.100
It's the best teams, you know,

00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:40.350
the sort of adage is every
team loses 50 to 60 games

00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:42.400
and every team wins
50 to 60 games.

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:44.800
And, it's what teams do
with the other 40 games

00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:50.620
that distinguishes, you know,
the best from the worst.

00:18:50.620 --> 00:18:54.670
And, similarly, you know, a
300 hitter is a great hitter

00:18:54.670 --> 00:18:56.550
and succeeds 30% of the time.

00:18:56.550 --> 00:18:58.200
And, a 200 hitter
is a terrible hitter

00:18:58.200 --> 00:18:59.910
and succeeds 20% of the time.

00:18:59.910 --> 00:19:01.210
You know, more or less.

00:19:01.210 --> 00:19:03.650
So, I think that's actually
really something that Studs,

00:19:03.650 --> 00:19:09.050
there's something about the idea
that, like, everybody fails,

00:19:09.050 --> 00:19:10.400
and everybody succeeds.

00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:13.930
And, people, and the sort of,
and there's a lot of both.

00:19:13.930 --> 00:19:17.640
And, you get different turns
to bat, in a sense kind

00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:19.950
of that feels like something

00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:23.160
that connects people
to baseball.

00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:27.190
Studs, as everyone, I think,
knows, was a huge aficionado

00:19:27.190 --> 00:19:30.430
of music, and his work
itself is hugely musical

00:19:30.430 --> 00:19:32.090
and attuned to music.

00:19:32.090 --> 00:19:34.660
And, a lot of the
credit for that goes

00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:35.960
to amazing people he worked

00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:38.730
with like the incredible editor
Sydney Lewis, like the sort

00:19:38.730 --> 00:19:43.920
of sense of musicality of
the human voice and structure

00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:47.090
and improvisation and
relationship to jazz.

00:19:47.090 --> 00:19:50.540
And, I think even the, that's
when I was thinking the books

00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:52.300
that there's sort of, there's
something, a way of thinking

00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:54.740
about the passages is
almost like innings

00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:56.040
in a certain kind of way.

00:19:56.040 --> 00:20:00.150
So, I think we could go on,
and you'll pluck other themes.

00:20:00.150 --> 00:20:04.850
But, I wanted to sort of begin
by sharing some of how, for me,

00:20:04.850 --> 00:20:06.700
and this is part of why it
feels really special to be here.

00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:09.750
These things all feel like
they get to the deepest core

00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:11.370
of what I love about Studs.

00:20:11.370 --> 00:20:14.360
So, I'm going to hand it
over to David who's going

00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:17.160
to read a couple passages over
the course of our time together,

00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:22.060
but this first one sort
of begins talking about,

00:20:22.060 --> 00:20:27.770
it's Studs talking about his
relationship to famous owner,

00:20:27.770 --> 00:20:30.800
baseball owner of the
Chicago White Sox, Bill Veeck.

00:20:32.820 --> 00:20:34.820
&gt;&gt; David Strathairn: To
me, Bill Veeck was the last

00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:39.770
of the independent spirits in
sports, and certainly baseball.

00:20:39.770 --> 00:20:43.900
Before he died, we were sitting
at Miller's Pub in Chicago,

00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:45.530
and he would say, "We're gone.

00:20:45.530 --> 00:20:47.280
It's corporate America."

00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:49.410
And, he was referring to
the Steinbrenners and,

00:20:49.410 --> 00:20:53.200
etc. Corporate America
is taking over.

00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:56.750
It's not as personal as it was.

00:20:56.750 --> 00:21:01.290
What I love about Bill Veeck is
the way he analyzed baseball.

00:21:01.290 --> 00:21:03.900
He say, "You know, we
are a country of losers

00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:08.690
to a great extent, but certain
moments, we experience victory.

00:21:08.690 --> 00:21:11.130
Let's savor that."

00:21:11.130 --> 00:21:14.740
For example, the
exploding scoreboard.

00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:16.520
A corny thing.

00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:20.050
And Comiskey Park when he was
General Manager of the Sox.

00:21:20.050 --> 00:21:24.630
The electric scoreboard,
and the team was horrible.

00:21:24.630 --> 00:21:28.340
The team was rotten, but the
home team gets a homerun,

00:21:28.340 --> 00:21:29.670
and the crowd goes crazy.

00:21:29.670 --> 00:21:32.090
He got that from
William Saroyan's play,

00:21:32.090 --> 00:21:33.390
"The Time of Your Life."

00:21:33.390 --> 00:21:34.690
It's about the depression.

00:21:34.690 --> 00:21:36.420
There's a bar in San Francisco.

00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:38.270
All the losers are there.

00:21:38.270 --> 00:21:41.020
Now, there's a kid
playing a pinball machine.

00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:42.860
He never wins.

00:21:42.860 --> 00:21:45.810
One day, he hits the jackpot,
and the pinball machine.

00:21:45.810 --> 00:21:47.110
The flags go up.

00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:50.400
The band plays Dixie,
and it's glorious.

00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:52.410
That's the electric scoreboard.

00:21:52.410 --> 00:21:55.970
The losers can enjoy
a moment of triumph.

00:21:55.970 --> 00:21:59.670
He believed in that very much.

00:21:59.670 --> 00:22:03.750
The Chicago White Sox were a
blue collar team, south side,

00:22:03.750 --> 00:22:06.430
steel mills, Irish
to great extent.

00:22:06.430 --> 00:22:08.680
It was the park of losers.

00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:14.370
Ever since the Black Sox,
Joe Jackson and the others.

00:22:14.370 --> 00:22:18.690
Now, why Babe Ruth is
the greatest athlete.

00:22:18.690 --> 00:22:21.210
Well, first of all, it's
from my vantage point.

00:22:21.210 --> 00:22:25.100
I'm 86 as we have this
conversation, going on 87.

00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:27.750
So, naturally, a certain
period of my life,

00:22:27.750 --> 00:22:31.270
the period of the 1930s, and
for that matter the '20s,

00:22:31.270 --> 00:22:34.820
I was a kid, a young man.

00:22:34.820 --> 00:22:37.970
It was The Babe who
saved baseball.

00:22:37.970 --> 00:22:40.320
Remember that, the
Black Sox scandal?

00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:43.970
That was it for baseball, and
then they bring in that phony,

00:22:43.970 --> 00:22:46.440
the Commissioner K.M. Landis.

00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:49.800
And, they punished the ones
up front, the ball players.

00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:51.790
And, of course, you
exonerate the others

00:22:51.790 --> 00:22:55.960
who are really responsible and
who made these guys culpable.

00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:58.600
So, there's baseball
in terrible form,

00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:02.420
and along comes this Paul
Bunyan-esque figure, this guy,

00:23:02.420 --> 00:23:08.260
this man child, The Babe, George
Herman Ruth, the Sultan of Swat.

00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:10.780
Bang. And, you see him
circling those bases

00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:15.750
with the skinny delicate legs
tripping, almost feminine like.

00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:20.340
We know off the field, he
was quite a colorful figure.

00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:23.970
He had a gargantuan appetite
in every aspect of life,

00:23:23.970 --> 00:23:26.290
but The Babe represented,

00:23:26.290 --> 00:23:29.700
the word is eponymous,
more than synonymous.

00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:34.300
When you say "baseball" you
say Babe Ruth, of course.

00:23:34.300 --> 00:23:38.890
The World Series at Cubs
field, and they're booing him.

00:23:38.890 --> 00:23:41.780
He's facing Cubs
pitcher Charlie Root.

00:23:41.780 --> 00:23:43.230
Now, here comes the story.

00:23:43.230 --> 00:23:47.430
Now, everybody in know
says they saw the game.

00:23:47.430 --> 00:23:49.990
That means the place could
have seated a million people.

00:23:49.990 --> 00:23:51.460
You've heard this many times.

00:23:51.460 --> 00:23:54.060
I saw that game.

00:23:54.060 --> 00:23:58.760
Some point towards center field,
some point toward right field.

00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:00.890
Apparently, he did
point somewhere,

00:24:00.890 --> 00:24:03.810
and he hit the ball
where he pointed.

00:24:03.810 --> 00:24:06.910
That seems to be the truth, and
I could lie and say, of course,

00:24:06.910 --> 00:24:10.480
I was one of the million who
was at Cubs Park that day.

00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:13.770
Invariably, you'll find fans who
create a moment they've heard

00:24:13.770 --> 00:24:15.920
about and they want to
be part of it again.

00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:18.510
Well, again, we're losers,

00:24:18.510 --> 00:24:22.090
so it's a natural
logic that I was there.

00:24:22.090 --> 00:24:26.270
And, you half believe them.

00:24:26.270 --> 00:24:28.140
Wait until next year.

00:24:28.140 --> 00:24:31.150
The phrase of all sportscasters.

00:24:31.150 --> 00:24:34.600
It's waiting for Godot in a way.

00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:39.170
The Chicagoans are Vladimir
and Estragon, Deedee and Gogo,

00:24:39.170 --> 00:24:42.230
the two tramps rolled
into one, the two heroes

00:24:42.230 --> 00:24:44.440
of Samuel Beckett's play.

00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:47.760
We are waiting for
Godot, waiting forever,

00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:50.560
but at least there's hope.

00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:52.510
That, in a sense, is Chicago.

00:24:52.510 --> 00:25:02.070
[ Applause ]

00:25:02.070 --> 00:25:03.370
&gt;&gt; Tony Macalus: So, we'll go

00:25:03.370 --> 00:25:04.670
and hear a little
Studs from the archive.

00:25:04.670 --> 00:25:05.970
This is Studs with
Lawrence Ritter,

00:25:05.970 --> 00:25:07.270
author of "The Glory
of Their Times."

00:25:07.270 --> 00:25:09.650
Just a brief passage.

00:25:09.650 --> 00:25:10.950
&gt;&gt; Allison Schein Holmes: And,

00:25:10.950 --> 00:25:13.250
I was locked out,
so give me a second.

00:25:19.350 --> 00:25:23.290
I didn't want it to make a
noise while David was reading,

00:25:23.290 --> 00:25:28.660
so that is why it
is not unlocked.

00:25:30.740 --> 00:25:32.580
&gt;&gt; Tony Macalus: I think all the
clips we'll be playing today,

00:25:32.580 --> 00:25:34.780
just a handful of
them, are available

00:25:34.780 --> 00:25:37.440
on the website among
the many, many.

00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:40.810
We can talk a bit more, or we
can jump ahead and come back

00:25:40.810 --> 00:25:42.800
if you want a little
more time, too.

00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:44.100
&gt;&gt; Allison Schein
Holmes: Hang on.

00:25:44.100 --> 00:25:46.080
Sorry. This is not my
machine, so I'm dealing

00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:51.470
with other people's
login information.

00:25:51.470 --> 00:25:52.770
&gt;&gt; Tony Macalus: While
we're waiting for this,

00:25:52.770 --> 00:25:54.560
one of the things that
Stud liked to talk about,

00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:57.190
and when you hear any of this
audio or what we just heard here

00:25:57.190 --> 00:25:59.850
from David, too, is this
concept of the feeling tone.

00:25:59.850 --> 00:26:01.950
Studs had lots of
great definitions

00:26:01.950 --> 00:26:03.610
for describing what
he did in terms

00:26:03.610 --> 00:26:06.670
of when it was oral history
or radio or performance

00:26:06.670 --> 00:26:08.510
which is an own thing to itself.

00:26:08.510 --> 00:26:11.350
But, Studs liked to talk about
the feeling tone being this,

00:26:11.350 --> 00:26:13.630
the way I think of it is
kind of the quality you get

00:26:13.630 --> 00:26:16.270
in somebody's voice that's
beyond the literal meaning

00:26:16.270 --> 00:26:17.570
of their words.

00:26:17.570 --> 00:26:21.160
But, the kind of the way that
they sigh or laugh or even,

00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:23.570
you know, light a
cigarette and inhale or pause

00:26:23.570 --> 00:26:25.650
in a conversation that gives
you a sense of what it felt

00:26:25.650 --> 00:26:27.960
like to live through
a certain experience.

00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:30.750
And, when you listen to some of
these programs, it think it's,

00:26:30.750 --> 00:26:32.050
one of the things
that's exciting

00:26:32.050 --> 00:26:35.530
about the audio archive is that
it's not just hearing history,

00:26:35.530 --> 00:26:38.060
seeing it written down in
the page or even visually.

00:26:38.060 --> 00:26:41.290
But, getting that
feeling tone, that.

00:26:41.290 --> 00:26:44.140
There's a program with Studs
is talking with a group

00:26:44.140 --> 00:26:46.310
from the student nonviolent
coordinating committee

00:26:46.310 --> 00:26:48.730
that have been doing lunch
counter protests in the south.

00:26:48.730 --> 00:26:50.470
And, they were interviewing
Studs.

00:26:50.470 --> 00:26:51.770
He, fairly young people.

00:26:51.770 --> 00:26:54.350
They'd been in prison and dealt
with the dogs and so forth.

00:26:54.350 --> 00:26:58.070
And, in programs like that, you
hear the fear in their voices

00:26:58.070 --> 00:27:00.090
as they're describing
things, but hen, gradually,

00:27:00.090 --> 00:27:03.140
and as they sing together a
little bit, how the fear shifts

00:27:03.140 --> 00:27:06.550
from fear to pride and a
certain kind of triumph.

00:27:06.550 --> 00:27:07.850
And, that's the kind
of thing that,

00:27:07.850 --> 00:27:09.170
if you're just seeing
it written on the page,

00:27:09.170 --> 00:27:12.460
you just don't get it all in
an audio archive like this.

00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:16.370
And, particularly exciting when
you think about us students.

00:27:16.370 --> 00:27:18.310
We can move on and come back
to this a little bit later

00:27:18.310 --> 00:27:22.260
if you want, but while, well,
we'll see if Allison comes back,

00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:24.720
and we'll jump back
into [inaudible].

00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:26.740
But, just last week, I
was in Ireland talking

00:27:26.740 --> 00:27:29.110
about the archive to a big
oral history conference.

00:27:29.110 --> 00:27:31.710
We were talking particularly
about the Cold War and radio

00:27:31.710 --> 00:27:33.430
and how you communicated things.

00:27:33.430 --> 00:27:36.090
And, there's a program in the
archive on Studs was in England

00:27:36.090 --> 00:27:39.330
in 1962 visiting the home,

00:27:39.330 --> 00:27:43.400
the cottage of the wizened
philosopher Bertrand Russell

00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:46.120
19-- fall of 1962, the day

00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:48.170
that the Cuban Missile
Crisis erupted.

00:27:48.170 --> 00:27:50.510
And, Bertrand Russell, at
the age of 90 was the person,

00:27:50.510 --> 00:27:53.560
the point person for,
you know, talking,

00:27:53.560 --> 00:27:55.230
leading the anti-nuclear
movement.

00:27:55.230 --> 00:27:56.930
And, there was Studs with
his portable [inaudible] tape

00:27:56.930 --> 00:27:59.610
recorder talking with
Bertrand Russell.

00:27:59.610 --> 00:28:01.750
You know, opening the
conversation while the clock

00:28:01.750 --> 00:28:04.910
dings in the background saying
something along the lines of,

00:28:04.910 --> 00:28:07.410
"Is that the clock of
doom striking midnight

00:28:07.410 --> 00:28:08.750
or just an ordinary clock?"

00:28:08.750 --> 00:28:10.430
And, the phone's ringing
throughout the interview.

00:28:10.430 --> 00:28:13.900
And, just this sense of being in
a moment in history, you know,

00:28:13.900 --> 00:28:15.370
sitting there wondering

00:28:15.370 --> 00:28:19.400
if the world was possibly
facing nuclear annihilation

00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:22.030
and hearing the voice
of Bertrand Russell,

00:28:22.030 --> 00:28:24.500
rising voice trying
to bring some calm

00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:26.700
to this clearly terrifying
moment.

00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:29.290
So, just a few of my
favorite examples.

00:28:29.290 --> 00:28:31.390
And, do you want to go and
jump into another reading,

00:28:31.390 --> 00:28:32.890
and then we can jump back to,

00:28:32.890 --> 00:28:34.470
maybe jump back to
Lawrence Ritter.

00:28:34.470 --> 00:28:35.770
&gt;&gt; Derek Goldman:
Yeah, [inaudible].

00:28:35.770 --> 00:28:37.070
&gt;&gt; Tony Macalus: So,
let's move ahead.

00:28:37.070 --> 00:28:38.370
&gt;&gt; Derek Goldman:
Introduce this one?

00:28:38.370 --> 00:28:39.670
&gt;&gt; Tony Macalus: Yeah.

00:28:39.670 --> 00:28:40.970
&gt;&gt; Derek Goldman:
So, this is one of,

00:28:40.970 --> 00:28:42.270
we have three readings total.

00:28:42.270 --> 00:28:43.570
This is, one of them is in a
different voice than Studs,

00:28:43.570 --> 00:28:45.790
but one that I think is mirrors.

00:28:45.790 --> 00:28:50.520
It's the voice of Hank Edinger
who is featured in the book

00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:54.010
"Will the Circle be Unbroken"
and was a friend of Studs

00:28:54.010 --> 00:28:56.600
and a retired printer
at the time.

00:28:56.600 --> 00:29:02.380
And, kind of a lifelong
bar fly denizen,

00:29:02.380 --> 00:29:04.480
larger than life personality.

00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:06.770
And, this, again, the
context for the book

00:29:06.770 --> 00:29:09.640
"Will the Circle be Unbroken"
if you don't know it,

00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:13.500
is about mortality and
relationship to death

00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:19.590
which here, you'll see, for Hank
is quite tied to his connection

00:29:19.590 --> 00:29:22.200
or at least a question
about baseball.

00:29:24.250 --> 00:29:26.870
&gt;&gt; David Strathairn: My family
consisted of 11 children.

00:29:26.870 --> 00:29:29.100
I'm number ten.

00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:32.810
The first four died in
infancy from Scarlet Fever.

00:29:32.810 --> 00:29:35.910
The other seven were
remarkable in their survival.

00:29:35.910 --> 00:29:40.990
I'm a good example of that
because I'm now 88 years old.

00:29:40.990 --> 00:29:43.800
I don't have any
troubles physically.

00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:47.730
I'm drinking my beers every
day at the old down ale house

00:29:47.730 --> 00:29:50.900
and Billy Goats,
and I sleep well.

00:29:50.900 --> 00:29:56.560
I feel the approach of
ale housers disease.

00:29:56.560 --> 00:29:58.610
Oh, that's my name for it.

00:29:58.610 --> 00:30:00.250
The loss of certain memories

00:30:00.250 --> 00:30:03.640
that were usually
so clear in my mind.

00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:08.990
Has there ever been one
single tiny bit of evidence

00:30:08.990 --> 00:30:11.440
that there's a hereafter?

00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:12.740
Never once.

00:30:12.740 --> 00:30:14.360
There is no evidence.

00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:18.560
There is never anybody
that comes back.

00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:19.990
The earth is here.

00:30:19.990 --> 00:30:21.290
We're here.

00:30:21.290 --> 00:30:22.590
The animals are here.

00:30:22.590 --> 00:30:27.470
The birds are here, and then,
what do you need God for?

00:30:27.470 --> 00:30:29.590
What for when you die?

00:30:29.590 --> 00:30:31.870
You go back to the earth
from which you arose.

00:30:31.870 --> 00:30:33.420
You're dead, and that's the end.

00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:38.980
Kaput. People try to convert me,
try to get me back to religion.

00:30:38.980 --> 00:30:44.580
One was a bright, young man
from Moody Bible Institute.

00:30:44.580 --> 00:30:48.680
He accosts me at North and
Wells and hands me a pamphlet.

00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:49.980
I said, "No, thanks.

00:30:49.980 --> 00:30:51.500
I happen to be an atheist."

00:30:51.500 --> 00:30:55.140
He says, "You can't
be an atheist."

00:30:55.140 --> 00:30:56.670
And, I says, "I can't.

00:30:56.670 --> 00:31:00.330
Well, I figure I've been an
atheist for about 50, 60 years.

00:31:00.330 --> 00:31:02.340
Why can't it be?

00:31:02.340 --> 00:31:05.670
He says, "Who made you?"

00:31:05.670 --> 00:31:09.980
and I said, "You mean to say
that you attained the age of 25

00:31:09.980 --> 00:31:13.210
and nobody explained the
facts of life to you yet?"

00:31:15.110 --> 00:31:17.850
He took his pamphlet
back, but he laughed,

00:31:17.850 --> 00:31:20.470
and he got a kick out of it.

00:31:20.470 --> 00:31:24.750
I ask people, "Do you believe
in the Noah's ark story?

00:31:24.750 --> 00:31:27.450
Two each of everything?"

00:31:27.450 --> 00:31:30.700
Yes, the Bible says it's so.

00:31:30.700 --> 00:31:34.170
Well, I says, "Well,
then, tell me,

00:31:34.170 --> 00:31:37.060
what do the anteaters
have for the second meal?"

00:31:37.060 --> 00:31:39.110
[ Laughter ]

00:31:39.110 --> 00:31:40.420
And, they're dumfounded.

00:31:40.420 --> 00:31:45.300
You know, there are two
ants and two anteaters.

00:31:45.300 --> 00:31:49.490
Now, I have absolutely
no fear of death.

00:31:49.490 --> 00:31:54.020
I know that one of these days,
poof, I'm done, I'm gone.

00:31:54.020 --> 00:31:56.650
But, I'll live on in the
memories of a hell a lot

00:31:56.650 --> 00:32:00.190
of people that I
effected, because I feel

00:32:00.190 --> 00:32:04.500
that if anybody should go
to heaven, it should be me.

00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:07.610
I've spent my whole life
working for the laboring man,

00:32:07.610 --> 00:32:12.770
for farmers, for the poor,
against war, against racism.

00:32:12.770 --> 00:32:15.100
I just happen to think
that I'm a saint.

00:32:15.100 --> 00:32:17.180
[ Laughter ]

00:32:17.180 --> 00:32:20.100
In fact, I know when
I'm going to die.

00:32:20.100 --> 00:32:24.390
I made up my mind, oh,
say, ten years ago.

00:32:24.390 --> 00:32:27.660
I'm going to die in the
year 2008, around November.

00:32:27.660 --> 00:32:30.750
And, I figure, when
that year comes,

00:32:30.750 --> 00:32:36.100
I'm going to borrow money,
sell everything I have,

00:32:36.100 --> 00:32:40.480
which is nothing, accumulate
as much money as I can,

00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:42.310
and bet the whole thing
that the Cubs are going

00:32:42.310 --> 00:32:43.610
to win the World Series.

00:32:43.610 --> 00:32:45.470
[ Laughter ]

00:32:45.470 --> 00:32:51.270
But, it would be 100 years since
they did, and I figure they have

00:32:51.270 --> 00:32:53.020
to do it once in a century.

00:32:53.020 --> 00:32:56.380
And, when I get that money, I'm
going to throw the biggest party

00:32:56.380 --> 00:32:59.510
at the ale house and at Billy
Goats, and that'll be enough.

00:32:59.510 --> 00:33:09.050
[ Applause ]

00:33:09.050 --> 00:33:10.350
&gt;&gt; Derek Goldman: So,

00:33:10.350 --> 00:33:11.650
just a quick footnote,
as you probably know.

00:33:11.650 --> 00:33:15.270
The Cubs did not win the
World Series by 2008.

00:33:15.270 --> 00:33:18.870
Although, they've
won it since in 2016.

00:33:18.870 --> 00:33:21.660
But, the, but it's interesting.

00:33:21.660 --> 00:33:24.760
But, Stubs passed away
on October 31, 2008.

00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:28.030
So, when I now hear that
passage about November of 2008.

00:33:28.030 --> 00:33:30.150
And, of course, it was just
days before the election

00:33:30.150 --> 00:33:32.820
of Barak Obama who he knew well.

00:33:32.820 --> 00:33:37.190
And so, that November
2008 date still resonates

00:33:37.190 --> 00:33:39.720
in different ways
ten years later

00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:42.260
than it did when Hank spoke it.

00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:46.650
&gt;&gt; Tony Macalus: Do we want
to move to John talking

00:33:46.650 --> 00:33:47.950
about "Eight Men Out"?

00:33:47.950 --> 00:33:49.490
We'll get to audio at the end.

00:33:49.490 --> 00:33:51.460
That'll be the, yeah.

00:33:51.460 --> 00:33:52.940
&gt;&gt; John Sayles: I had met Studs.

00:33:52.940 --> 00:33:56.600
I did his radio show
for our movie "Return

00:33:56.600 --> 00:33:58.930
of the Secaucus 7"
which David was in.

00:33:58.930 --> 00:34:00.640
And.

00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:03.040
[ Applause ]

00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:06.630
Had heard him on radio and
kind of knew who he was.

00:34:06.630 --> 00:34:09.000
I was a big fan of
Nelson Algrens,

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:13.620
and he and Nelson Algren, the
novelist were really tight.

00:34:13.620 --> 00:34:18.590
And, my first meeting with
Studs, I felt like, "Oh, my god,

00:34:18.590 --> 00:34:20.300
I'm not going to get
a word in edgewise."

00:34:20.300 --> 00:34:24.020
You know, thought this
guy asked questions,

00:34:24.020 --> 00:34:26.710
but he actually,
he was an archive.

00:34:26.710 --> 00:34:30.320
He was an archive with two
legs, and if you got him started

00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:33.100
on anything, he would
start to free associate.

00:34:33.100 --> 00:34:38.200
So, one day, on the set, the
newsroom set that we had,

00:34:38.200 --> 00:34:41.130
there was a picture of,
photograph of Jack Dempsey.

00:34:41.130 --> 00:34:42.530
"Jack Dempsey, Jack.

00:34:42.530 --> 00:34:46.050
I saw Jack Dempsey in
the Drake Hotel once.

00:34:46.050 --> 00:34:47.350
We had a meeting at the Drake.

00:34:47.350 --> 00:34:49.680
There was a wonderful
bellhop at the Drake Hotel."

00:34:49.680 --> 00:34:52.990
And then, he'd talk for half
an hour about the bellhop

00:34:52.990 --> 00:34:55.950
and maybe never get
back to Jack Dempsey.

00:34:55.950 --> 00:34:57.250
So, I figured I'm cooked.

00:34:57.250 --> 00:34:58.550
I'm going to be on this show.

00:34:58.550 --> 00:35:01.130
This guy's just going to talk,
and I hope he saw the movie.

00:35:01.130 --> 00:35:03.960
And then, the minute
the radio show started,

00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:06.380
he was like a chess master.

00:35:06.380 --> 00:35:07.680
He started down a road.

00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:09.380
I'm like, where's
he going with this?

00:35:09.380 --> 00:35:12.010
And, sure enough,
at ten of the hour,

00:35:12.010 --> 00:35:14.210
he'd bring it back
to where he started.

00:35:14.210 --> 00:35:17.260
He always did this thing
of writing down about 2/3

00:35:17.260 --> 00:35:19.670
of the way through the
show the name of a song.

00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:20.970
And, he'd hand it

00:35:20.970 --> 00:35:23.470
to a production assistant
who'd go back to his engineer.

00:35:23.470 --> 00:35:24.900
And, that was the
song that was going

00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:27.300
to be played as the show ended.

00:35:27.300 --> 00:35:30.230
And, for our Secaucus 7 show,

00:35:30.230 --> 00:35:33.000
it was John Prine
singing "Illegal Smile".

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:34.950
Perfect song for that
particular thing.

00:35:34.950 --> 00:35:40.250
So, I knew Studs, and I had
written the screenplay for

00:35:40.250 --> 00:35:42.690
"Eight Men Out" 13 years
before I got to make it.

00:35:42.690 --> 00:35:45.200
So, it was a long,
long, long period.

00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:47.190
And, I had gotten
to that project

00:35:47.190 --> 00:35:52.060
because I had read a long
prose poem by Nelson Algren,

00:35:52.060 --> 00:35:54.240
something for opening day.

00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:58.030
And, he, you know, talked about
the individuals on the team.

00:35:58.030 --> 00:36:00.310
And then, he footnoted
Eliot Asinof's book

00:36:00.310 --> 00:36:04.540
"Eight Men Out" And, we
eventually got an option

00:36:04.540 --> 00:36:07.110
on Eliot's book, and
I got to make it.

00:36:07.110 --> 00:36:10.650
So, it was this long
process where, as I say,

00:36:10.650 --> 00:36:13.760
I started out with Martin
Sheen at third base and ended

00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:15.420
up with Charlie Sheen
in center field.

00:36:15.420 --> 00:36:20.540
But, the one guy I'd
always had in my mind,

00:36:20.540 --> 00:36:22.950
there were these two sports
writers who were the guys

00:36:22.950 --> 00:36:26.520
who kind of blew the story, who,
because other sports writers,

00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:27.820
they didn't want to talk.

00:36:27.820 --> 00:36:29.120
They knew it was going on.

00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:30.420
They didn't want
to talk about it.

00:36:30.420 --> 00:36:31.720
It's bad for baseball.

00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:37.180
Or, they had been taking so much
of Charles Comiskey's free lunch

00:36:37.180 --> 00:36:39.270
and free booze over the
years that they felt

00:36:39.270 --> 00:36:42.670
like I can't betray Comi, you
know, and write about, you know,

00:36:42.670 --> 00:36:43.970
what's going on with
the players.

00:36:43.970 --> 00:36:45.270
I'll just keep a lid on it.

00:36:45.270 --> 00:36:46.760
It'll be bad for baseball.

00:36:46.760 --> 00:36:50.270
But, Ring Lardner who was, had
been a sports writer for a long,

00:36:50.270 --> 00:36:52.210
long time and was covering that.

00:36:52.210 --> 00:36:55.960
And, another guy Hugh Fullerton
were the guys who said this is,

00:36:55.960 --> 00:36:57.800
something fishy is
going on here.

00:36:57.800 --> 00:36:59.690
And, we're going to, we're going
to get to the bottom of it,

00:36:59.690 --> 00:37:01.990
and we're going to
write about it.

00:37:01.990 --> 00:37:06.510
And, you know, got all kinds of
flack, and they were, you know,

00:37:06.510 --> 00:37:09.240
considered like anarchists
for doing this.

00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:12.340
And, the descriptions of
them were Ring Lardner

00:37:12.340 --> 00:37:17.350
who was this tall, thin guy who
had a very dry sense of humor

00:37:17.350 --> 00:37:23.380
and seemed kind of like, you
know, a funeral director.

00:37:23.380 --> 00:37:26.820
And then, this little cigar
stub of a man, Hugh Fullerton,

00:37:26.820 --> 00:37:29.120
were always this Mutt
and Jeff act walking

00:37:29.120 --> 00:37:31.340
down the street together.

00:37:31.340 --> 00:37:33.510
I'm 6'4" and Studs was not.

00:37:33.510 --> 00:37:36.050
[ Laughter ]

00:37:36.050 --> 00:37:38.640
So, one of the problems
in shooting scenes

00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:41.460
with us was getting
us in the same frame.

00:37:41.460 --> 00:37:45.480
When we were still, I would
either sit down or I would stand

00:37:45.480 --> 00:37:48.270
with my legs spread
really far apart and kind

00:37:48.270 --> 00:37:49.570
of come down to Studs' level.

00:37:49.570 --> 00:37:52.230
When we had to walk together,
we just had to widen the lens.

00:37:52.230 --> 00:37:55.440
And, when I, and I also knew

00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:58.060
that Studs had been a
buddy of Bill Veecks.

00:37:58.060 --> 00:38:02.840
And so, I figure, well, he must
be, you know, a Cubs fan by now.

00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:06.310
You know, and he's interviewed
all these baseball guys.

00:38:06.310 --> 00:38:07.610
So, Stud say, "Oh, yeah.

00:38:07.610 --> 00:38:08.910
Hugh Fullerton.

00:38:08.910 --> 00:38:10.210
I knew that, you know.

00:38:10.210 --> 00:38:11.570
And, I was around
for the Black Sox.

00:38:11.570 --> 00:38:16.130
And, it was like a pall over
Chicago, this awful history."

00:38:16.130 --> 00:38:19.300
And then, he got into
Kenesaw Mountain Landis

00:38:19.300 --> 00:38:21.200
and how he put the
wrong people in jail.

00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:23.450
And then, he ended up,
you know, being the czar

00:38:23.450 --> 00:38:26.630
of baseball forever
in equity of that.

00:38:26.630 --> 00:38:30.570
So, the first day that
Studs was on the set,

00:38:30.570 --> 00:38:32.850
he was telling stories and
everything, and you know,

00:38:32.850 --> 00:38:35.050
he had a great mind for
his lines and everything.

00:38:35.050 --> 00:38:36.870
No problem with the lines.

00:38:36.870 --> 00:38:39.500
The real problem was when
he would finish his lines,

00:38:39.500 --> 00:38:43.600
he'd freeze with
cigar in midair.

00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:45.170
And then, wait for another line.

00:38:45.170 --> 00:38:47.390
And then, he'd say his
line, and he'd freeze.

00:38:47.390 --> 00:38:50.770
I said, "Studs, this
isn't radio."

00:38:50.770 --> 00:38:53.130
"Oh, god. That's right,
that's not radio."

00:38:53.130 --> 00:38:56.520
Because he had, as a young
man, done radio plays.

00:38:56.520 --> 00:38:59.500
And, he said, "I always got
the Edward G. Robinson part,

00:38:59.500 --> 00:39:02.080
and I always got to hold the
cigar and say, 'Yeah, yeah.'"

00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:04.140
[ Laughter ]

00:39:04.140 --> 00:39:06.430
And, it actually took
them very many takes,

00:39:06.430 --> 00:39:08.560
and I had to remind
him many, many times,

00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:10.600
you know, this is not radio.

00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:12.990
You have to, like,
pretend you're listening

00:39:12.990 --> 00:39:14.290
to the other people even

00:39:14.290 --> 00:39:18.810
if you're really just
looking for your next line.

00:39:18.810 --> 00:39:21.350
And, the, I did a show
a couple more times.

00:39:21.350 --> 00:39:24.590
He did a novel, "Union
Dues" that I had done.

00:39:24.590 --> 00:39:27.140
And, I came in, and I
figured, well, okay.

00:39:27.140 --> 00:39:29.640
It's a long book, and I'm
sure he has researchers

00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:30.940
and everything.

00:39:30.940 --> 00:39:33.850
And, I sit down with him,
and there are probably

00:39:33.850 --> 00:39:38.990
in a 375 page book,
there's 100 little markers.

00:39:38.990 --> 00:39:41.220
He's annotated my book.

00:39:41.220 --> 00:39:42.520
And so, as we're going through,

00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:45.770
and he's color coded
the annotations.

00:39:45.770 --> 00:39:48.040
So, the red ones are the
first ones to get to.

00:39:48.040 --> 00:39:50.750
And, I mean, just amazing.

00:39:50.750 --> 00:39:53.000
And, so comfortable
in the conversation.

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:57.300
There's no "ums" and "ers",
but he was this magician

00:39:57.300 --> 00:39:58.600
at drawing people out.

00:39:58.600 --> 00:40:02.470
And, he knew kind of where
he wanted to take you,

00:40:02.470 --> 00:40:04.340
where he wanted you
to lead the audience

00:40:04.340 --> 00:40:08.070
to to reveal yourself,
to reveal the book.

00:40:08.070 --> 00:40:12.220
One of the things in the
archive is his interview

00:40:12.220 --> 00:40:13.520
with Eliot Asinof.

00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:21.420
Eliot Asinof was, he'd been
a minor league ball player.

00:40:21.420 --> 00:40:25.470
He basically, because he wasn't
great and because he was Jewish,

00:40:25.470 --> 00:40:28.190
he didn't get to, and World War
II came around, he didn't get

00:40:28.190 --> 00:40:29.560
to be a major league
ball player.

00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:33.480
But, he probably could have hung
on if he hadn't been Jewish.

00:40:33.480 --> 00:40:35.900
He got black listed.

00:40:35.900 --> 00:40:40.520
Eventually, he found that
his name showed up first

00:40:40.520 --> 00:40:45.250
when he got his, you
know, his, you know,

00:40:45.250 --> 00:40:48.830
much redacted stuff
from the FBI.

00:40:48.830 --> 00:40:50.870
His first appearance
on their list was

00:40:50.870 --> 00:40:52.880
for signing a petition outside

00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:55.420
of Yankee Stadium saying
it was time for them

00:40:55.420 --> 00:40:57.100
to have a black ball player.

00:40:57.100 --> 00:41:00.190
That got you on J. Edgar
Hoover's shit list at that time.

00:41:00.190 --> 00:41:03.340
And then, he married
Marlon Brando's sister,

00:41:03.340 --> 00:41:08.110
and she got black listed,
basically, as a, you know,

00:41:08.110 --> 00:41:11.920
a diversion so they wouldn't
go after her brother.

00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:14.500
And, pretty soon,
he was black listed.

00:41:14.500 --> 00:41:21.020
And, he started tracking
down these baseball players,

00:41:21.020 --> 00:41:23.520
and he talked to these
guys just before they died,

00:41:23.520 --> 00:41:25.000
many of them just
before they died.

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:27.320
And, they all had their
own version of the thing,

00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:31.630
but he wrote this, you know, and
Nelson Algren was kind of one

00:41:31.630 --> 00:41:33.860
of the people who got
him started on it.

00:41:33.860 --> 00:41:37.850
But, their talk is
an incredible one.

00:41:37.850 --> 00:41:42.510
His nickname among his writer
friends was "God's angry man".

00:41:42.510 --> 00:41:45.040
[ Laughter ]

00:41:45.040 --> 00:41:47.830
And, he was late in the
black list, so he was a front

00:41:47.830 --> 00:41:49.970
for a couple years
for other guys

00:41:49.970 --> 00:41:51.910
who had already been
black listed.

00:41:51.910 --> 00:41:54.700
Except he was so cantankerous.

00:41:54.700 --> 00:41:57.150
He went in for one writer,

00:41:57.150 --> 00:41:59.200
and he started arguing
with the producer.

00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:02.290
Those are the stupidest notes
I've ever seen and got fired.

00:42:02.290 --> 00:42:06.700
When it wasn't even his project.

00:42:06.700 --> 00:42:11.130
And, Studs was kind of the
benign version of, you know,

00:42:11.130 --> 00:42:13.340
they had this very similar past.

00:42:13.340 --> 00:42:14.680
And, Studs was kind
of the benign,

00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:16.300
who could get along
with anybody.

00:42:16.300 --> 00:42:19.080
And, Eliot was the guy
who would find a way

00:42:19.080 --> 00:42:21.740
to start a war with
almost anybody.

00:42:21.740 --> 00:42:26.100
&gt;&gt; David Strathairn: I just
wanted to add one thing.

00:42:26.100 --> 00:42:29.740
When John mentioned how Studs
was kind of a chessman and knew

00:42:29.740 --> 00:42:32.360
that he could make
friends with anybody.

00:42:32.360 --> 00:42:37.520
The one, the one firsthand
experience I had during the

00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:42.230
shooting of the film was sitting
at lunch with Studs with a bunch

00:42:42.230 --> 00:42:44.210
of some of the extras.

00:42:44.210 --> 00:42:49.900
And, we were shooting
in Indiana, a red state.

00:42:49.900 --> 00:42:53.690
And, we were sitting
across the table

00:42:53.690 --> 00:42:57.800
from some locals form
there, and Studs,

00:42:57.800 --> 00:43:01.150
he just got them
into conversation.

00:43:01.150 --> 00:43:05.060
And, just started kind
of peeling away the,

00:43:05.060 --> 00:43:08.300
what they thought about the
present state of the union.

00:43:08.300 --> 00:43:15.690
And, just because of his sort
of elfish charm and how his,

00:43:15.690 --> 00:43:20.810
just his gift of being, you
know, of interviewing somebody,

00:43:20.810 --> 00:43:24.680
it came, it came to
pass that all these guys

00:43:24.680 --> 00:43:26.370
at the other table
started realizing

00:43:26.370 --> 00:43:30.190
or thinking they had a kindred
spirit in which they could bring

00:43:30.190 --> 00:43:35.710
out every vehement, you know,
vitriolic thing they had

00:43:35.710 --> 00:43:38.040
against the other side.

00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:40.170
And, there's Studs, you know,

00:43:40.170 --> 00:43:46.000
a socialist guy who's just
pulling this stuff from them.

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:47.400
And then, lunch was done.

00:43:47.400 --> 00:43:51.630
We're all sitting around
taking a lesson in this skill

00:43:51.630 --> 00:43:56.110
and wondering how is he getting
these people to be so free

00:43:56.110 --> 00:44:01.480
with volunteering the,
you know, what they think.

00:44:01.480 --> 00:44:03.650
And then, lunch is
over, and we leave.

00:44:03.650 --> 00:44:08.850
And, he sits back, and he says
something to the effect that,

00:44:08.850 --> 00:44:11.230
"There, you know,
it's not all that hard

00:44:11.230 --> 00:44:14.510
to get everybody's dirty
laundry on the line."

00:45:25.320 --> 00:45:26.620
But, the second [inaudible].

00:45:26.620 --> 00:45:27.920
I had two lines.

00:45:27.920 --> 00:45:29.220
I want to tell you about this.

00:45:29.220 --> 00:45:30.520
Years ago, there
was a [inaudible].

00:45:30.520 --> 00:45:31.820
I was in TV.

00:45:31.820 --> 00:45:33.300
We'll come to that in a minute.

00:45:33.300 --> 00:45:35.810
Chicago TV, a thing
called "Studs Place".

00:45:35.810 --> 00:45:37.110
And, the director
was named Dan Petrie

00:45:37.110 --> 00:45:39.600
who finally became
a movie director.

00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:43.110
[inaudible] Jane Fonda in a
movie called "The Doll Maker".

00:45:43.110 --> 00:45:45.910
"The Doll Maker"
[inaudible] a very good one

00:45:45.910 --> 00:45:50.280
where she plays the wife of an
Appalachian guy who get a job

00:45:50.280 --> 00:45:53.450
in World War II in a
war plant in Detroit.

00:45:53.450 --> 00:45:55.860
But, they shot the
film in Chicago.

00:45:55.860 --> 00:46:01.840
And so, she comes to the
[inaudible] into a taxicab,

00:46:01.840 --> 00:46:03.410
and the two lines
for the cab driver.

00:46:03.410 --> 00:46:06.390
So, Dan Petrie says to Jane
Fonda [inaudible] Chicago.

00:46:06.390 --> 00:46:10.530
He's in Chicago doing it, but
[inaudible] he's very funny.

00:46:10.530 --> 00:46:12.550
And, she's, "I know Studs.

00:46:12.550 --> 00:46:16.540
We're on the same platform
together many times during the

00:46:16.540 --> 00:46:19.820
Vietnam, anti-Vietnam stuff."

00:46:19.820 --> 00:46:22.300
So, we do the scene.

00:46:22.300 --> 00:46:25.200
Two lines [inaudible] I've never
sat behind the wheel in my life.

00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:26.500
I don't drive a car.

00:46:26.500 --> 00:46:28.200
I've never, I have
no idea [inaudible].

00:46:28.200 --> 00:46:29.590
Step on it.

00:46:29.590 --> 00:46:30.890
You don't step on
it [inaudible].

00:46:30.890 --> 00:46:32.190
And, that [inaudible].

00:46:32.190 --> 00:46:39.480
So, I'm [inaudible] two
lines, and it's funny.

00:46:39.480 --> 00:46:44.920
Then, he say, "Now, you pull
out, drive away," [inaudible].

00:46:44.920 --> 00:46:50.020
I said, "What the hell
are you talking about?"

00:46:50.020 --> 00:46:51.320
And, he's.

00:46:51.320 --> 00:46:52.620
&gt;&gt; Allison Schein Holmes:
Do you want to do the,

00:46:52.620 --> 00:46:54.190
he said continue
on talking with?

00:46:54.190 --> 00:46:55.490
&gt;&gt; Tony Macalus: Yeah,
let's hear a little bit

00:46:55.490 --> 00:46:56.960
of this very brief
clip here now.

00:46:56.960 --> 00:46:58.260
This is Studs with
Lawrence Ritter,

00:46:58.260 --> 00:47:00.080
the author of "The
Glory of their Times."

00:47:00.080 --> 00:47:02.380
So, it's a minute or
so to hear the voice

00:47:02.380 --> 00:47:04.280
from the radio archive itself.

00:47:04.280 --> 00:47:06.860
&gt;&gt; And, it was a primitive
thing, just beginning,

00:47:06.860 --> 00:47:08.160
and there was no money in it.

00:47:08.160 --> 00:47:09.500
The fields were rough.

00:47:09.500 --> 00:47:10.800
They had rocks in them.

00:47:10.800 --> 00:47:12.910
Very often, the players
went out with their own rake

00:47:12.910 --> 00:47:14.950
and raked up their position.

00:47:14.950 --> 00:47:17.360
The fans were part of the game.

00:47:17.360 --> 00:47:18.880
They were on the
field half the time,

00:47:18.880 --> 00:47:20.420
and the umpire shooed them off.

00:47:20.420 --> 00:47:21.720
And, they'd run back again.

00:47:21.720 --> 00:47:24.400
And, the players and
the fans were one.

00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:28.660
Now, there's a very stern
railing separates the playing

00:47:28.660 --> 00:47:31.650
field and the grandstand,
and neither one can go

00:47:31.650 --> 00:47:32.950
on the other's territory.

00:47:32.950 --> 00:47:35.650
&gt;&gt; I think this is
worth dwelling upon.

00:47:35.650 --> 00:47:36.950
Something has happened.

00:47:36.950 --> 00:47:39.220
Quite obviously, we speak
of a certain game that kids

00:47:39.220 --> 00:47:41.270
in every small town
everywhere, they,

00:47:41.270 --> 00:47:44.450
he was the culture hero,
the baseball player.

00:47:44.450 --> 00:47:45.940
Of course, Cobb.

00:47:45.940 --> 00:47:49.460
Of course, a man like
Crawford, a man like [inaudible]

00:47:49.460 --> 00:47:52.960
and the very colorful and
eccentric Rube Waddell.

00:47:52.960 --> 00:47:55.030
But, there's a little
difference.

00:47:55.030 --> 00:47:57.830
Even though some of the players
today may be equally as good,

00:47:57.830 --> 00:47:59.800
some of the great
ones like Mays.

00:47:59.800 --> 00:48:01.910
&gt;&gt; Baseball took hold
quickly in this country.

00:48:01.910 --> 00:48:04.340
It was a country that,
it was a sport, I think,

00:48:04.340 --> 00:48:08.730
that was very well suited for
late 19th century America.

00:48:08.730 --> 00:48:10.820
And, it took hold very quickly,

00:48:10.820 --> 00:48:13.760
really just got started
in about 1880, 1890.

00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:19.420
And, by 1910, 1915, the top
notch ball player had a position

00:48:19.420 --> 00:48:22.560
in American society in
the mind of the kid.

00:48:22.560 --> 00:48:23.940
Not in the mind of the grown up.

00:48:23.940 --> 00:48:26.530
In the mind of the kid
that was unequaled.

00:48:26.530 --> 00:48:29.040
Or maybe the heavyweight
champion of the world.

00:48:29.040 --> 00:48:32.160
Maybe John L. Sullivan
also was no pinnacle.

00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:33.460
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:48:33.460 --> 00:48:34.760
&gt;&gt; But, nobody else.

00:48:34.760 --> 00:48:36.060
&gt;&gt; But, there was this rapport

00:48:36.060 --> 00:48:37.360
between audience,
even physically.

00:48:37.360 --> 00:48:38.660
You say, they want on the field.

00:48:38.660 --> 00:48:39.960
There was this rapport.

00:48:39.960 --> 00:48:41.260
They were not watching
automata at work.

00:48:41.260 --> 00:48:42.560
&gt;&gt; Oh, no, no, no.

00:48:42.560 --> 00:48:43.860
&gt;&gt; Individual man.

00:48:43.860 --> 00:48:45.160
&gt;&gt; [inaudible] is full of
even as late as the '20s

00:48:45.160 --> 00:48:48.680
when Paul Waner who was the
old youngest in the book

00:48:48.680 --> 00:48:50.000
who played the latest.

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:52.870
Even as late as the '20s,
Paul talked to the people

00:48:52.870 --> 00:48:54.170
in the right field bleachers.

00:48:54.170 --> 00:48:55.470
He talked to the fans.

00:48:55.470 --> 00:48:59.610
It was a, there was a
oneness inside of the stadium

00:48:59.610 --> 00:49:02.660
that didn't stop
at the railings.

00:49:02.660 --> 00:49:03.960
&gt;&gt; John Sayles: One
thing that happened

00:49:03.960 --> 00:49:05.570
in the 1919 World Series

00:49:05.570 --> 00:49:08.030
that I didn't have
enough money at the time.

00:49:08.030 --> 00:49:09.630
Because it was before CGI

00:49:09.630 --> 00:49:13.070
and were having a hard
time getting extras.

00:49:13.070 --> 00:49:20.220
Is Comiskey was such a skinflint
and so into making money

00:49:20.220 --> 00:49:22.760
that after he sold
all of the seats for,

00:49:22.760 --> 00:49:26.000
there were nine World Series
games scheduled that year.

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:27.610
And, they didn't go
all the full nine,

00:49:27.610 --> 00:49:30.070
but it was going
to be nine games.

00:49:30.070 --> 00:49:34.660
He sold standing
room in the outfield.

00:49:34.660 --> 00:49:39.770
So, there were about 300 people
in left field, and they had two,

00:49:39.770 --> 00:49:41.930
you know, ushers holding a rope

00:49:41.930 --> 00:49:44.100
to keep them back
against the wall.

00:49:44.100 --> 00:49:46.380
And so, of course,
when, you know,

00:49:46.380 --> 00:49:49.190
it was a ground rule double
if you hit into that area,

00:49:49.190 --> 00:49:51.900
so of course, a Chicago
guy hit a fly ball there,

00:49:51.900 --> 00:49:54.630
they would push forward
and bring the wall in.

00:49:54.630 --> 00:49:57.950
And, when a Cincinnati guy
hit one, they would back

00:49:57.950 --> 00:50:01.350
up against the wall and give
their guy a chance to catch it.

00:50:01.350 --> 00:50:04.830
So, it was a much more
personal kind of thing.

00:50:04.830 --> 00:50:08.140
And, you were talking to
guys throughout the game.

00:50:08.140 --> 00:50:12.350
They were, they were,
there was no hiding them.

00:50:12.350 --> 00:50:14.000
&gt;&gt; Tony Macalus: So, we're going
to look at just a little clip

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:16.680
from the film, and then
another reading and.

00:50:16.680 --> 00:50:17.980
&gt;&gt; Allison Schein Holmes:
[inaudible] find the clip.

00:50:17.980 --> 00:50:19.280
&gt;&gt; Tony Macalus: Okay.

00:50:19.280 --> 00:50:20.580
&gt;&gt; Allison Schein Holmes: Sorry.

00:50:20.580 --> 00:50:21.880
&gt;&gt; Tony Macalus: We will.

00:50:21.880 --> 00:50:23.900
So, let's go on to the
last reading there,

00:50:23.900 --> 00:50:25.630
and then we'll bring the
clip up if we find it.

00:50:25.630 --> 00:50:27.220
And then, hear a
little more Studs.

00:50:27.220 --> 00:50:28.840
But then, we want
to open things up

00:50:28.840 --> 00:50:30.540
and get questions
from you all as well.

00:50:30.540 --> 00:50:32.840
So, anything you
want to say there?

00:50:32.840 --> 00:50:35.380
&gt;&gt; Derek Goldman: Do you want to
do that just a thought on the.

00:50:35.380 --> 00:50:36.680
&gt;&gt; Tony Macalus: Yeah.

00:50:36.680 --> 00:50:37.980
&gt;&gt; Derek Goldman: Do
you want to, should we,

00:50:37.980 --> 00:50:39.280
do we have the audio Roger
Kahn Jackie Robinson?

00:50:39.280 --> 00:50:41.090
[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:50:41.090 --> 00:50:42.390
Why don't we do that
before the reading,

00:50:42.390 --> 00:50:43.690
and then we can open it up if.

00:50:43.690 --> 00:50:44.990
&gt;&gt; Tony Macalus: Okay.

00:50:44.990 --> 00:50:46.290
That sounds good.

00:50:46.290 --> 00:50:48.330
So, this is [inaudible]
Roger Kahn talking

00:50:48.330 --> 00:50:50.060
about Jackie Robinson.

00:50:50.060 --> 00:50:51.360
What more can you say?

00:50:51.360 --> 00:50:55.330
&gt;&gt; It's a book about certain men
who happen in the glory moments

00:50:55.330 --> 00:50:58.470
of their lives to have
been baseball players.

00:50:58.470 --> 00:51:01.580
It's about skilled
craftsmen at a certain moment

00:51:01.580 --> 00:51:04.790
in their lives how it happened
to them after the skill had gone

00:51:04.790 --> 00:51:06.190
and the glory had gone.

00:51:06.190 --> 00:51:07.490
So, what happens as humans.

00:51:07.490 --> 00:51:10.340
But, certain people
together at a certain moment.

00:51:10.340 --> 00:51:11.640
And, you said integrated.

00:51:11.640 --> 00:51:15.950
So, now, the catalytic figure
here is Jackie Robinson.

00:51:15.950 --> 00:51:19.900
&gt;&gt; Jackie's just the tremendous
man and overlooked now,

00:51:19.900 --> 00:51:21.200
I think, generally by society.

00:51:21.200 --> 00:51:22.630
People forget.

00:51:22.630 --> 00:51:25.820
Let me say some of the things
that Jackie had endured

00:51:25.820 --> 00:51:27.730
within the bound of taste.

00:51:27.730 --> 00:51:30.730
This is the 25th anniversary,

00:51:30.730 --> 00:51:32.800
this Opening Day will
be the 25th anniversary

00:51:32.800 --> 00:51:35.320
of Jackie Robinson's first
game in the major leagues.

00:51:35.320 --> 00:51:36.840
His black cat was loose.

00:51:36.840 --> 00:51:39.290
&gt;&gt; 1947.

00:51:39.290 --> 00:51:41.740
&gt;&gt; 1947, Opening Day.

00:51:41.740 --> 00:51:44.200
He went hitless.

00:51:44.200 --> 00:51:48.370
A black cat was loosed on the
field, and Jack walked over

00:51:48.370 --> 00:51:51.630
and picked up the animal
and stroked its fur.

00:51:52.720 --> 00:51:57.160
Watermelon, shoes were held
up, and they shine these.

00:51:57.160 --> 00:51:59.350
He went up to bat in St.
Louis, and somebody said,

00:51:59.350 --> 00:52:01.400
"No wonder you can't
get a decent shine

00:52:01.400 --> 00:52:03.400
in St. Louis anymore."

00:52:03.400 --> 00:52:05.240
John Kiren [assumed spelling]
described this as the subtle wit

00:52:05.240 --> 00:52:06.870
so characteristic
of ball players

00:52:06.870 --> 00:52:08.370
with some irony years ago.

00:52:08.370 --> 00:52:10.930
The Cardinals were
going to strike.

00:52:10.930 --> 00:52:13.710
The strike was broken by
enterprising newspaper work.

00:52:13.710 --> 00:52:16.740
The Dodgers themselves
petitioned,

00:52:16.740 --> 00:52:19.600
and we were not talking then
about scatter site housing,

00:52:19.600 --> 00:52:21.520
about integrated
schools, about anything.

00:52:21.520 --> 00:52:24.730
We were talking about the right
of a man to play in the infield

00:52:24.730 --> 00:52:26.030
of a major league baseball team.

00:52:26.030 --> 00:52:28.990
And, I think it's probably
hard for young people

00:52:28.990 --> 00:52:31.900
to realize what a
flaming issue this was.

00:52:31.900 --> 00:52:34.310
And so, as the times
have changed,

00:52:34.310 --> 00:52:36.640
and Jack is a republican.

00:52:36.640 --> 00:52:40.110
He seems conservative
to many young militants.

00:52:40.110 --> 00:52:42.540
Works for Nelson
Rockefeller on occasion.

00:52:42.540 --> 00:52:44.830
And, I said to him, one
day we were having lunch.

00:52:44.830 --> 00:52:47.990
I said, "Jack, you know,
you've become conservative."

00:52:47.990 --> 00:52:50.190
And, he said, "I have
not become conservative.

00:52:50.190 --> 00:52:52.650
I'm exactly what I
was, what I always was,

00:52:52.650 --> 00:52:54.400
but the times have
changed around me."

00:52:54.400 --> 00:52:55.700
&gt;&gt; That's interesting, though,

00:52:55.700 --> 00:52:58.530
the young today Jackie
Robinson conservative.

00:52:58.530 --> 00:53:01.120
The young militants look upon
him as somewhat of a Tom.

00:53:01.120 --> 00:53:03.190
Yet, forgetting what he did

00:53:03.190 --> 00:53:04.490
because it's kind
of [inaudible].

00:53:04.490 --> 00:53:06.710
But, the same thing, he's saying

00:53:06.710 --> 00:53:08.900
that times have altered
considerably you see.

00:53:08.900 --> 00:53:13.700
All he was is this man who was a
conservative politically wanted

00:53:13.700 --> 00:53:15.450
to follow his craft.

00:53:15.450 --> 00:53:18.410
&gt;&gt; Tony Macalus: Great.

00:53:18.410 --> 00:53:20.680
&gt;&gt; Matthew Barton: If I could.

00:53:20.680 --> 00:53:21.980
&gt;&gt; Derek Goldman: Yeah, please.

00:53:21.980 --> 00:53:23.280
Hi. Yeah.

00:53:23.280 --> 00:53:24.790
&gt;&gt; Matthew Barton: The
sound archivist in me,

00:53:24.790 --> 00:53:27.020
just going to break
continuity for a moment

00:53:27.020 --> 00:53:28.760
and go back to Lawrence Ritter.

00:53:28.760 --> 00:53:31.200
I suspect most of you know
who Lawrence Ritter was

00:53:31.200 --> 00:53:33.680
and what he did, but I just
wanted to make sure for anyone

00:53:33.680 --> 00:53:36.420
who doesn't because
it's really singular.

00:53:36.420 --> 00:53:40.530
In the early '60s, I think, he
went around and interviewed,

00:53:40.530 --> 00:53:44.320
recorded interviews with as
many early baseball players

00:53:44.320 --> 00:53:45.890
as he could find.

00:53:45.890 --> 00:53:48.290
And, this became the basis
of his book "The Glory

00:53:48.290 --> 00:53:50.840
of Their Times" which
is a marvelous book.

00:53:50.840 --> 00:53:53.740
And, those recordings,
you know, thankfully,

00:53:53.740 --> 00:53:55.040
and this is the archivist
speaking.

00:53:55.040 --> 00:53:57.250
And, those are recordings,
thankfully,

00:53:57.250 --> 00:53:58.550
that have been archived.

00:53:58.550 --> 00:53:59.850
They all survived.

00:53:59.850 --> 00:54:02.290
There was even a record album
that came out in the '60s,

00:54:02.290 --> 00:54:05.380
and you can probably find
some of these things online.

00:54:05.380 --> 00:54:08.230
So, a plug for Lawrence
Ritter and what he did,

00:54:08.230 --> 00:54:10.470
that book, those recordings.

00:54:10.470 --> 00:54:11.770
&gt;&gt; Derek Goldman: Right.

00:54:11.770 --> 00:54:14.650
It's my favorite, it's the
best baseball book, I think.

00:54:14.650 --> 00:54:15.950
It's a beautiful book.

00:54:15.950 --> 00:54:21.150
So, this is the third of our
readings, and it's, so Studs,

00:54:21.150 --> 00:54:23.210
as we've said, did not live

00:54:23.210 --> 00:54:25.470
to see the Cubs winning the
World Series, but he did live

00:54:25.470 --> 00:54:29.270
to see the White Sox win the
World Series which was a team,

00:54:29.270 --> 00:54:30.570
as you've heard a
little bit already,

00:54:30.570 --> 00:54:33.300
that in some ways was
closer to his heart

00:54:33.300 --> 00:54:35.570
and deeper in his heart.

00:54:35.570 --> 00:54:38.880
And, these, this last
one is kind of woven

00:54:38.880 --> 00:54:41.660
from some of Studs' writings.

00:54:41.660 --> 00:54:44.900
He was looked to around
that time to sort of comment

00:54:44.900 --> 00:54:47.660
on what was happening with
the White Sox and that sort

00:54:47.660 --> 00:54:49.950
of opened out as it
always did with Studs

00:54:49.950 --> 00:54:51.600
into some other commentary.

00:54:51.600 --> 00:54:55.100
So, this is from that,
from that period.

00:54:56.700 --> 00:54:58.540
&gt;&gt; David Strathairn: It's
a possibility the Cubs

00:54:58.540 --> 00:55:00.850
and the White Sox
in the World Series.

00:55:00.850 --> 00:55:03.710
The thought is overwhelming.

00:55:03.710 --> 00:55:07.270
It's happened before, and
you could look it up, 1906.

00:55:07.270 --> 00:55:08.750
The Sox won.

00:55:08.750 --> 00:55:12.320
Of all that has happened,
the Roaring '20s,

00:55:12.320 --> 00:55:16.080
the Great Depression, the war
against fascism, the Cold War,

00:55:16.080 --> 00:55:21.160
McCarthyism, the mad adventure
in southeast Asia, our own time

00:55:21.160 --> 00:55:22.960
of great bewilderment.

00:55:22.960 --> 00:55:24.360
The Cubs and the White Sox

00:55:24.360 --> 00:55:27.510
in the World Series would
be the most unimaginable.

00:55:27.510 --> 00:55:30.040
[ Laughter ]

00:55:30.040 --> 00:55:31.480
I'm working on my memoirs.

00:55:31.480 --> 00:55:32.950
It's the last thing I'll do

00:55:32.950 --> 00:55:35.520
if I can finish it
before I check out.

00:55:35.520 --> 00:55:39.840
I'm going to be 94 soon,
so if I make it a year,

00:55:39.840 --> 00:55:41.800
I've got it made.

00:55:41.800 --> 00:55:45.240
I was raised as a
Giants fan in New York.

00:55:45.240 --> 00:55:49.420
I was eight years old
when I came here in 1920.

00:55:49.420 --> 00:55:51.980
I was a John McGraw fan.

00:55:51.980 --> 00:55:54.750
John McGraw was for
blacks in baseball.

00:55:54.750 --> 00:55:56.050
You know that?

00:55:56.050 --> 00:56:00.550
He tried to pass off a
couple of blacks as Cubans.

00:56:00.550 --> 00:56:03.500
After a while, I
became a Sox fan.

00:56:03.500 --> 00:56:05.300
How could you not
root for a team

00:56:05.300 --> 00:56:11.450
that after the 1919 scandal was
so bad you had to root for them?

00:56:11.450 --> 00:56:15.850
Earl [inaudible], first base,
had a wooden leg almost.

00:56:15.850 --> 00:56:19.080
And, an outfielder
named Smeed Jolly.

00:56:19.080 --> 00:56:20.950
How could you not
root for a team

00:56:20.950 --> 00:56:24.280
with an outfielder
named Smeed Jolly?

00:56:25.670 --> 00:56:28.180
The Cubs have been
a legend for years.

00:56:28.180 --> 00:56:30.100
Nothing to do with baseball.

00:56:30.100 --> 00:56:32.250
You have to understand that.

00:56:32.250 --> 00:56:37.540
The Cubs' popularity had nothing
whatsoever to do with baseball.

00:56:37.540 --> 00:56:41.690
It's a place to come to,
as they say the air show is

00:56:41.690 --> 00:56:45.100
or the auto show or
the Art Institute.

00:56:45.100 --> 00:56:48.270
It's a place to be
at, and many have come

00:56:48.270 --> 00:56:50.900
from suburbs and nearby towns.

00:56:50.900 --> 00:56:53.310
It's not really baseball.

00:56:53.310 --> 00:56:57.760
It's a place to be at, and
we see that with the bimbos

00:56:57.760 --> 00:57:00.920
and the louts and
the Bud Lights.

00:57:02.090 --> 00:57:06.830
After the game, you ask
them, "Who did the Cubs play?

00:57:06.830 --> 00:57:09.430
What was the score?"

00:57:09.430 --> 00:57:11.300
They shake their heads.

00:57:11.300 --> 00:57:12.970
It's not about baseball.

00:57:12.970 --> 00:57:17.110
It's about having
been to a place to be.

00:57:17.110 --> 00:57:21.540
You're talking to an old
guy who's a curmudgeon.

00:57:21.540 --> 00:57:22.840
Was I an athlete?

00:57:22.840 --> 00:57:24.220
Oh, god, no.

00:57:24.220 --> 00:57:26.850
I was the worst athlete ever.

00:57:26.850 --> 00:57:30.080
I'd fall off bicycles.

00:57:30.080 --> 00:57:32.730
You know who was a great story?

00:57:32.730 --> 00:57:36.030
Mo Berg. Now, he could catch.

00:57:36.030 --> 00:57:39.970
Now, he was so-so,
but he was a linguist.

00:57:39.970 --> 00:57:43.250
He worked in the Army
to do some decoding.

00:57:43.250 --> 00:57:45.420
He could speak about
seven languages,

00:57:45.420 --> 00:57:50.630
so one of the writers wrote, "He
could speak in seven languages

00:57:50.630 --> 00:57:52.200
but couldn't catch in one."

00:57:52.200 --> 00:57:54.390
[ Laughter ]

00:57:54.390 --> 00:57:57.670
Now, I don't want to glorify the
old days because they weren't

00:57:57.670 --> 00:58:00.970
that good either, but when
you went to see the Sox,

00:58:00.970 --> 00:58:03.420
at least it was a ballgame.

00:58:03.420 --> 00:58:07.350
I'm not saying Sox fans
are brighter than Cub fans.

00:58:07.350 --> 00:58:08.770
They're not.

00:58:08.770 --> 00:58:10.340
Well, neither one is.

00:58:10.340 --> 00:58:12.600
[ Laughter ]

00:58:12.600 --> 00:58:15.030
I'll never forget this.

00:58:15.030 --> 00:58:18.390
I was sitting with Bill Veeck in
the Bard's room, the dining room

00:58:18.390 --> 00:58:20.300
at the old Comiskey Park.

00:58:20.300 --> 00:58:21.810
And, it was about two weeks

00:58:21.810 --> 00:58:25.150
after he hired Larry
Doby as manager.

00:58:25.150 --> 00:58:28.200
Remember, he had Larry
as the first black player

00:58:28.200 --> 00:58:31.580
for the Indians, and
then, he managed the Sox.

00:58:31.580 --> 00:58:35.570
It was two weeks, two weeks, and
the Sox were losing more games

00:58:35.570 --> 00:58:37.220
than they were winning.

00:58:37.220 --> 00:58:40.880
So, there's a call, and
he answers the call.

00:58:40.880 --> 00:58:45.810
He's looking at me and
saying, "Oh, Mrs. Meyerhoff,"

00:58:45.810 --> 00:58:47.950
or whatever her name was.

00:58:47.950 --> 00:58:51.390
"You think I should
fire Larry Doby.

00:58:51.390 --> 00:58:52.820
It's only two weeks.

00:58:52.820 --> 00:58:56.320
We've only played
about ten games.

00:58:56.320 --> 00:58:58.180
Oh, oh, no.

00:58:58.180 --> 00:59:00.900
I know. It's not race."

00:59:00.900 --> 00:59:03.460
And, he raises his
eyes to the ceiling.

00:59:03.460 --> 00:59:05.720
"Oh, it's not race at all.

00:59:05.720 --> 00:59:09.120
No, I realize that."

00:59:09.120 --> 00:59:14.350
A 1919 Black Sox scandal,
Buck Weaver, third baseman,

00:59:14.350 --> 00:59:16.540
did not take part in it.

00:59:16.540 --> 00:59:19.120
He didn't inform
on the other guys.

00:59:19.120 --> 00:59:20.420
The eighth guy kicked

00:59:20.420 --> 00:59:23.660
out of should have been
Sox owner Charles Comiskey,

00:59:23.660 --> 00:59:26.320
the way he exploited
the players.

00:59:26.320 --> 00:59:29.960
It made them a natural for
a guy like Arnold Rothstein,

00:59:29.960 --> 00:59:35.190
the gambler who fixed
the 1919 World Series.

00:59:35.190 --> 00:59:39.600
I had a friend, 91 like me,
who wants to live to 2008

00:59:39.600 --> 00:59:42.350
because he thinks the Cubs
and the White Sox may meet

00:59:42.350 --> 00:59:45.570
in the World Series to
celebrate the 100th anniversary

00:59:45.570 --> 00:59:48.220
of the Cubs winning the series.

00:59:48.220 --> 00:59:50.570
At least we can dream.

00:59:50.570 --> 00:59:52.880
It's over the rainbow.

00:59:52.880 --> 00:59:55.650
We're all Judy Garlands.

00:59:55.650 --> 00:59:57.990
Do saucers fly?

00:59:57.990 --> 01:00:00.510
Do fiddlers play on rooftops?

01:00:00.510 --> 01:00:11.400
[ Applause ]

01:00:11.400 --> 01:00:12.700
&gt;&gt; Tony Macalus: So,
let's take some questions.

01:00:12.700 --> 01:00:14.690
All right.

01:00:14.690 --> 01:00:15.990
Do we want to pass it?

01:00:15.990 --> 01:00:17.290
We don't have a mic
we can pass to.

01:00:17.290 --> 01:00:18.590
Okay. We'll repeat
the question, then.

01:00:18.590 --> 01:00:19.890
Great.

01:00:19.890 --> 01:00:21.340
&gt;&gt; Thank you all.

01:00:21.340 --> 01:00:26.080
I just want to put in a plug

01:00:26.080 --> 01:00:32.820
for [inaudible] who's not just
a reporter, but he wrote some

01:00:32.820 --> 01:00:39.060
of the most marvelous
stories about baseball ever.

01:00:39.060 --> 01:00:41.570
And, he's largely
forgotten now, unfortunately.

01:00:41.570 --> 01:00:42.870
But, especially [inaudible].

01:00:42.870 --> 01:00:44.170
&gt;&gt; Derek Goldman: Thank you.

01:00:44.170 --> 01:00:45.470
&gt;&gt; John Sayles: Yeah,
Ring, Jr., his son got,

01:00:45.470 --> 01:00:46.770
I got to know a little bit.

01:00:46.770 --> 01:00:48.070
He, we invited him to the set.

01:00:48.070 --> 01:00:49.370
And, I said, and
there was a scene

01:00:49.370 --> 01:00:50.670
where I was playing
Ring Lardner,

01:00:50.670 --> 01:00:54.410
and I asked him afterwards
what it was

01:00:54.410 --> 01:00:56.700
like to see somebody
play his father.

01:00:56.700 --> 01:00:59.010
And, he said, "Uncomfortably
familiar."

01:00:59.010 --> 01:01:00.310
[ Laughter ]

01:01:00.310 --> 01:01:01.610
Which I took as a compliment.

01:01:01.610 --> 01:01:03.480
But, he was a great writer.

01:01:03.480 --> 01:01:05.190
He never quite wrote novels.

01:01:05.190 --> 01:01:06.490
He wrote short stories.

01:01:06.490 --> 01:01:13.650
He wrote musicals, and he was
so, he was a friend of most

01:01:13.650 --> 01:01:18.240
of those ball players, and he
was, but he was a straight guy.

01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:23.850
He was so troubled by the
immorality of it and then, just,

01:01:23.850 --> 01:01:28.860
he felt like he had
let down their public.

01:01:28.860 --> 01:01:31.270
And, he always was
very uncomfortable

01:01:31.270 --> 01:01:34.730
with this relationship with
Comiskey and free drinks

01:01:34.730 --> 01:01:36.030
for all the reporters.

01:01:36.030 --> 01:01:41.400
And, some of that, the story
about how he developed his style

01:01:41.400 --> 01:01:43.940
of writing because he was,
Hemingway was a big fan

01:01:43.940 --> 01:01:47.480
of Ring Lardner's, and
one of the things he liked

01:01:47.480 --> 01:01:49.570
about Ring Lardner is
he felt like he was one

01:01:49.570 --> 01:01:52.610
of the most successful
and few American writers

01:01:52.610 --> 01:01:56.140
after Mark Twain who
wrote in vernacular.

01:01:56.140 --> 01:01:59.300
And, he started writing in
this voice that you hear,

01:01:59.300 --> 01:02:02.530
and you know me now and
some of these other stories.

01:02:02.530 --> 01:02:05.510
He traveled with both the Cubs
and the White Sox and went

01:02:05.510 --> 01:02:06.980
on some of their
road games with them.

01:02:06.980 --> 01:02:09.510
And, he'd be on the train
with them and stuff like that.

01:02:09.510 --> 01:02:12.290
And, you notice that he'd
stay in the same hotel.

01:02:12.290 --> 01:02:14.620
There was this one
player who always sat next

01:02:14.620 --> 01:02:16.780
to him on the, at breakfast.

01:02:16.780 --> 01:02:19.950
And, he started to realize
there's something weird.

01:02:19.950 --> 01:02:22.800
He always orders what I order.

01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:26.210
Exactly. And, he started
ordering some kind of, you know,

01:02:26.210 --> 01:02:28.280
exotic things, and the guy
would order the same thing.

01:02:28.280 --> 01:02:32.500
And, then, he realized
the guy's illiterate.

01:02:32.500 --> 01:02:36.010
And, I'm a big breakfast
eater, and he just figures,

01:02:36.010 --> 01:02:37.310
well, I'll read the menu.

01:02:37.310 --> 01:02:38.610
Oh, I'll have the same he does.

01:02:38.610 --> 01:02:40.960
Or, I just repeat the thing.

01:02:40.960 --> 01:02:47.150
So, it kind of was obvious
the guy thought, well,

01:02:47.150 --> 01:02:49.890
Ring must know that, but we're
not going to talk about it.

01:02:49.890 --> 01:02:52.440
And, one day, the guy came
to him and said, "Ring,

01:02:52.440 --> 01:02:57.540
I want to play a joke on my
wife, and I'm going to tell her

01:02:57.540 --> 01:02:59.360
that I'm learning how to type.

01:02:59.360 --> 01:03:00.780
But, I don't really
know how to type.

01:03:00.780 --> 01:03:03.620
So, I'm going to dictate letters
to you, and you type them

01:03:03.620 --> 01:03:05.650
up like I wrote them."

01:03:05.650 --> 01:03:08.690
And, he realized the guy misses
his wife and wants to write

01:03:08.690 --> 01:03:11.070
to her, and he can't do it
because he's illiterate.

01:03:11.070 --> 01:03:14.090
And so, he went through
this charade, and you know,

01:03:14.090 --> 01:03:17.130
every couple days, the guy
would dictate, and the guy was,

01:03:17.130 --> 01:03:18.800
you know, not very educated.

01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:21.310
And, he made a lot
of grammar mistakes.

01:03:21.310 --> 01:03:24.620
And, Ring said, "I'm going
to spell like he could spell

01:03:24.620 --> 01:03:26.450
if he could spell at all."

01:03:26.450 --> 01:03:30.500
And, that was where that
voice originally came from was

01:03:30.500 --> 01:03:33.540
from this illiterate
guy dictating to Ring

01:03:33.540 --> 01:03:36.610
and him saying, "This guy's a
great storyteller, but I'm going

01:03:36.610 --> 01:03:39.530
to tell it in his voice."

01:03:39.530 --> 01:03:40.990
&gt;&gt; Tony Macalus: And,
there's a really wonderful,

01:03:40.990 --> 01:03:42.600
really enthralling
interview with Ring Lardner,

01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:44.390
Jr. in the Studs audio archive.

01:03:44.390 --> 01:03:46.080
We may get to a clip
of that at the end.

01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:47.380
We'll see.

01:03:47.380 --> 01:03:50.460
Okay. We'll start left and work
our way in the middle here.

01:03:50.460 --> 01:03:52.440
So. Yep.

01:03:52.440 --> 01:03:54.950
&gt;&gt; I was thrilled
that the footage

01:03:54.950 --> 01:04:02.490
of the 1919 World Series
surfaced [inaudible].

01:04:02.490 --> 01:04:10.430
But, I was wondering what other
audio visual record if any

01:04:10.430 --> 01:04:15.080
of the 1919 series exists.

01:04:15.080 --> 01:04:16.990
&gt;&gt; John Sayles: There was
very, very little at the time,

01:04:16.990 --> 01:04:19.970
and there was, it was
mostly in news reels.

01:04:19.970 --> 01:04:24.000
I have to figure in 1919,
you know, in the movie,

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.860
you see people listening
to crystal sets.

01:04:26.860 --> 01:04:29.080
So, radio hadn't
even really started.

01:04:29.080 --> 01:04:33.480
A couple years from then, for
the first many, many years,

01:04:33.480 --> 01:04:36.630
ballgames were not
broadcast live.

01:04:36.630 --> 01:04:39.950
It was two guys getting a ticker
tape, and there's famous stories

01:04:39.950 --> 01:04:42.420
of Ronald Reagan when
other guys, when he did it

01:04:42.420 --> 01:04:45.410
when the ticker tape would break
down, they'd, like, invent,

01:04:45.410 --> 01:04:48.760
well, the manager's going out
to the mound again, and it looks

01:04:48.760 --> 01:04:50.880
like it may rain, and
they're, you know.

01:04:50.880 --> 01:04:52.180
And, they'd have to stall.

01:04:52.180 --> 01:04:54.410
And, they would have sound
effects for a homerun

01:04:54.410 --> 01:04:56.390
and cheers and things like that.

01:04:56.390 --> 01:05:00.420
So, there just wasn't
that much film,

01:05:00.420 --> 01:05:05.840
and it came from the archives of
the news reels, and apparently,

01:05:05.840 --> 01:05:10.150
there was this stuff, you know,
up frozen under a, you know,

01:05:10.150 --> 01:05:13.360
a building that had been a movie
theater or something like that

01:05:13.360 --> 01:05:14.660
or had been converted

01:05:14.660 --> 01:05:16.620
into a movie theater
whenever the film got

01:05:16.620 --> 01:05:18.530
up during the gold rush.

01:05:18.530 --> 01:05:23.300
And, there's some interesting,
including this bizarre thing

01:05:23.300 --> 01:05:29.310
that somebody flew a plane over
game two and dropped a dummy

01:05:29.310 --> 01:05:31.020
of a ball player from it.

01:05:31.020 --> 01:05:32.320
And, people thought,
"Oh, my god.

01:05:32.320 --> 01:05:33.620
He's going to die."

01:05:33.620 --> 01:05:36.110
You know, and they actually
were warned about that,

01:05:36.110 --> 01:05:38.030
and so that was one of
the things that they got.

01:05:38.030 --> 01:05:41.680
But, it was amazing to see that
after we had made the movie.

01:05:41.680 --> 01:05:42.980
And, we felt like, geez,

01:05:42.980 --> 01:05:44.670
our uniforms look
really pretty good.

01:05:44.670 --> 01:05:47.060
[ Laughter ]

01:05:47.060 --> 01:05:48.360
&gt;&gt; Matthew Barton:
Just a general remark

01:05:48.360 --> 01:05:51.700
about what survives
of early radio.

01:05:51.700 --> 01:05:58.040
Even if games had been broadcast
in 1919 or in the 1920s,

01:05:58.040 --> 01:06:00.200
we probably wouldn't
have anything of them

01:06:00.200 --> 01:06:04.110
because very little radio
from before 1935 survives.

01:06:04.110 --> 01:06:07.950
The 1934 World Series does,
recordings of that do exist,

01:06:07.950 --> 01:06:12.270
but there was no easy way to
record radio at any length more

01:06:12.270 --> 01:06:15.140
than a few minutes
until about 1935.

01:06:15.140 --> 01:06:17.540
And, from that point
on, we do have a lot,

01:06:17.540 --> 01:06:21.750
but there's hardly any radio
survives from before 1935.

01:06:21.750 --> 01:06:23.050
&gt;&gt; Tony Macalus:
And, I'll just say

01:06:23.050 --> 01:06:25.210
if you want an internal
experience what it was

01:06:25.210 --> 01:06:28.620
like to be a nine year old kid
watching the 1919 White Sox,

01:06:28.620 --> 01:06:31.940
I recommend Nelson Algren's
wonderful prose poem "Chicago:

01:06:31.940 --> 01:06:34.600
City on the Make" which has
some great passages about that.

01:06:34.600 --> 01:06:35.900
All right.

01:06:35.900 --> 01:06:37.550
We'll jump over here.

01:06:37.550 --> 01:06:39.350
Yeah.

01:06:39.350 --> 01:06:48.040
[ Inaudible Comment ]

01:06:48.040 --> 01:06:49.340
&gt;&gt; John Sayles: Yeah.

01:06:49.340 --> 01:06:51.730
John Anderson, he's one of
those guys you'll recognize him.

01:06:51.730 --> 01:06:54.360
I had seen him in a
lot of movies, big,

01:06:54.360 --> 01:06:57.560
tall guy with a long face from
New England who's a Chicago,

01:06:57.560 --> 01:07:00.430
I mean a St. Louis
Cardinals fan actually.

01:07:00.430 --> 01:07:04.680
And, he just looked
a lot like Landis.

01:07:04.680 --> 01:07:07.480
He looked like Kenesaw
Mountain Landis.

01:07:07.480 --> 01:07:08.780
And, he knew it.

01:07:08.780 --> 01:07:10.080
[ Laughter ]

01:07:10.080 --> 01:07:13.560
And, the, my, the best story,

01:07:13.560 --> 01:07:15.680
I think Hal Holbrook
told you this story.

01:07:15.680 --> 01:07:18.700
Is he was sitting at a
table with Hal Holbrook

01:07:18.700 --> 01:07:22.460
and a couple other actors,
and they were actually talking

01:07:22.460 --> 01:07:25.770
about that they've all
played Lincoln at one point.

01:07:25.770 --> 01:07:27.910
He had that long face
and with a little beard,

01:07:27.910 --> 01:07:29.490
he really looked like Lincoln.

01:07:29.490 --> 01:07:32.820
And, some guy came over to the
table and said, "So, Lincoln?"

01:07:32.820 --> 01:07:35.220
And, one of them said, "Well,
yeah, I played him on stage,

01:07:35.220 --> 01:07:36.520
but you know, John
here played him

01:07:36.520 --> 01:07:37.820
in a TV movie and everything."

01:07:37.820 --> 01:07:39.200
And, somebody else
says, "Well, you know,

01:07:39.200 --> 01:07:41.170
and I did a traveling
one man show."

01:07:41.170 --> 01:07:42.470
He said, "No, no, no.

01:07:42.470 --> 01:07:44.510
Who owns the Lincoln
[inaudible] my car?"

01:07:44.510 --> 01:07:48.500
[ Laughter ]

01:07:48.500 --> 01:07:51.690
Terrific, terrific guy,
and you know, look him up.

01:07:51.690 --> 01:07:53.610
He's in every other
great western

01:07:53.610 --> 01:07:56.320
that you've watched,
and really cool guy.

01:07:56.320 --> 01:07:57.620
&gt;&gt; Allison Schein Holmes:
How about the gentleman

01:07:57.620 --> 01:07:58.920
in the back with the red shirt?

01:07:58.920 --> 01:08:01.580
&gt;&gt; On the theory that
history is made every day,

01:08:01.580 --> 01:08:08.170
does anybody written or
recorded [inaudible] Spanish

01:08:08.170 --> 01:08:11.620
speaking players?

01:08:11.620 --> 01:08:15.430
&gt;&gt; John Sayles: I actually
think that's just starting,

01:08:15.430 --> 01:08:19.880
and some of it is that the
Hispanic language stations are

01:08:19.880 --> 01:08:21.590
relatively new here.

01:08:21.590 --> 01:08:26.290
But, they, you know, those
were incredible fans,

01:08:26.290 --> 01:08:28.790
and I think the technology
didn't catch

01:08:28.790 --> 01:08:32.110
up with those radio stations
as quickly as it did here.

01:08:32.110 --> 01:08:35.810
So, the earliest guys, there's
very little of Roberto Clemente,

01:08:35.810 --> 01:08:37.320
for instance, on radio.

01:08:37.320 --> 01:08:41.390
There's a bit of him on TV,
but, you know, he was alone

01:08:41.390 --> 01:08:42.690
in Pittsburg for a while.

01:08:42.690 --> 01:08:46.180
There wasn't even much of a
Hispanic community at that time.

01:08:46.180 --> 01:08:47.650
&gt;&gt; Matthew Barton:
Yeah, one of the jewels

01:08:47.650 --> 01:08:50.250
of our recorded sound
collection is the NBC collection

01:08:50.250 --> 01:08:51.850
which starts in 1935.

01:08:51.850 --> 01:08:55.250
And, it's tens of thousands
of hours of every kind

01:08:55.250 --> 01:08:57.620
of radio there was,
not just sports.

01:08:57.620 --> 01:09:00.530
And, NBC had a Spanish
language service,

01:09:00.530 --> 01:09:05.320
and they had a man doing Spanish
play by play named Buck Canel.

01:09:05.320 --> 01:09:08.010
And, he actually recorded
an album in the '50s.

01:09:08.010 --> 01:09:09.880
It was like a baseball
game kind of album

01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:12.140
where there are different
outcomes and so on.

01:09:12.140 --> 01:09:13.540
I've been trying to,
we don't have any

01:09:13.540 --> 01:09:15.040
in our collection
that I've ever found.

01:09:15.040 --> 01:09:16.930
I've been trying
to find recordings

01:09:16.930 --> 01:09:19.570
of Buck Canel calling games.

01:09:19.570 --> 01:09:23.710
You know, if anybody's got
them, please come see me.

01:09:23.710 --> 01:09:28.790
Because he was the voice
of baseball in much

01:09:28.790 --> 01:09:31.020
of Latin America
and the Caribbean.

01:09:31.020 --> 01:09:35.330
And, ball players who came up
in the '50s and '60s all talk

01:09:35.330 --> 01:09:39.880
about hearing Buck Canel do
calls in their home countries.

01:09:39.880 --> 01:09:46.380
So, you know, that's one of my,
you know, top ten, you know,

01:09:46.380 --> 01:09:50.460
most elusive items is Buck Canel
and other Spanish broadcasters

01:09:50.460 --> 01:09:52.610
who would really be
great to get that in

01:09:52.610 --> 01:09:54.170
because it's a huge part
of baseball history.

01:09:54.170 --> 01:09:55.470
&gt;&gt; Allison Schein Holmes:

01:09:55.470 --> 01:09:57.750
Gentleman in the green
shirt, got a question?

01:09:57.750 --> 01:09:59.050
Yeah.

01:09:59.050 --> 01:10:01.650
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I just wanted
to mention I believe,

01:10:01.650 --> 01:10:04.170
although [inaudible]
actually was

01:10:04.170 --> 01:10:08.420
with [inaudible] during
the actual writing.

01:10:08.420 --> 01:10:13.780
And, [inaudible] came out about
ten years ago, and you know,

01:10:13.780 --> 01:10:19.040
in it, he talked about how
Fullerton really didn't have the

01:10:19.040 --> 01:10:22.480
power to bring the truth out.

01:10:22.480 --> 01:10:26.450
All he could really do was rail

01:10:26.450 --> 01:10:31.120
against [inaudible] how he
really just had [inaudible]

01:10:31.120 --> 01:10:34.110
gamblers and these sort
of dirty politicians

01:10:34.110 --> 01:10:38.090
and was wondering if, you know,
Studs ever sort of, you know,

01:10:38.090 --> 01:10:43.420
detailed any stories
he had about, you know,

01:10:43.420 --> 01:10:45.740
getting [inaudible]
underworld, seedy underworld.

01:10:45.740 --> 01:10:47.770
&gt;&gt; John Sayles: You know,
he, the when I talked to him

01:10:47.770 --> 01:10:49.960
about his own experience
with them, the guy he talked

01:10:49.960 --> 01:10:55.090
about the most was the guy
that John Cusack played.

01:10:55.090 --> 01:10:58.040
Buck was a guy who
hung around Chicago.

01:10:58.040 --> 01:11:00.090
He had, he was banned
from baseball.

01:11:00.090 --> 01:11:02.930
He, you know, he had
not taken any money.

01:11:02.930 --> 01:11:05.210
He had just not ratted
his friends out.

01:11:05.210 --> 01:11:06.510
He'd been at one meeting

01:11:06.510 --> 01:11:07.920
and said this doesn't
sound good to me.

01:11:07.920 --> 01:11:09.220
And, he left.

01:11:09.220 --> 01:11:13.220
And then, he ended up for
years trying to get reinstated,

01:11:13.220 --> 01:11:14.690
you know, when he
could still play.

01:11:14.690 --> 01:11:17.650
And then, even after
get his record cleared.

01:11:17.650 --> 01:11:21.600
He ended up coaching
girls softball in Chicago.

01:11:21.600 --> 01:11:24.570
So, he was somebody that
Studs would run into a lot.

01:11:24.570 --> 01:11:27.800
Studs didn't know, you know,
he had heard of Hugh Fullerton

01:11:27.800 --> 01:11:30.120
but had never met him.

01:11:30.120 --> 01:11:33.180
Christy Matthewson
actually had a lot of power

01:11:33.180 --> 01:11:34.670
because he was a
former baseball,

01:11:34.670 --> 01:11:37.930
and he was considered
kind of a saint.

01:11:37.930 --> 01:11:43.230
He had gone over after World War
I and been exposed to poison gas

01:11:43.230 --> 01:11:45.190
and had kind of ruined
his health.

01:11:45.190 --> 01:11:47.730
And so, he was this
kind of sainted guy,

01:11:47.730 --> 01:11:49.670
and so he was untouchable.

01:11:49.670 --> 01:11:52.120
You know, if he said
something in the press,

01:11:52.120 --> 01:11:53.630
nobody could really
come after him.

01:11:53.630 --> 01:11:57.880
He wasn't just some sports
writer who might even be Jewish.

01:11:57.880 --> 01:12:02.410
And, a lot of the reaction
against both Lardner's articles

01:12:02.410 --> 01:12:07.340
and Hugh Fullerton articles
were very anti-Semitic.

01:12:07.340 --> 01:12:09.330
They were just, well,
this is what, you know,

01:12:09.330 --> 01:12:11.890
you let Jews near baseball,
this is what happened.

01:12:11.890 --> 01:12:14.190
Even though none of the
players were Jewish.

01:12:19.090 --> 01:12:22.650
&gt;&gt; I don't know somebody
mentioned [inaudible] earlier,

01:12:22.650 --> 01:12:26.670
but I just wondered did he and
Studs Terkel know each other.

01:12:26.670 --> 01:12:28.500
And, is there ever a mention

01:12:28.500 --> 01:12:33.570
of the famous Billy
Goat Tavern on games.

01:12:33.570 --> 01:12:38.340
And, also, even though he
was a newspaper columnist,

01:12:38.340 --> 01:12:40.320
did he have any recordings

01:12:40.320 --> 01:12:42.580
of [inaudible] commenting
on baseball?

01:12:42.580 --> 01:12:43.880
&gt;&gt; Tony Macalus:
Yeah, I'll start,

01:12:43.880 --> 01:12:45.180
and then we can, anyone else.

01:12:45.180 --> 01:12:46.770
Yeah. Studs and [inaudible]
were very close friends.

01:12:46.770 --> 01:12:48.950
[inaudible] was on Studs'
show many, many times.

01:12:48.950 --> 01:12:50.810
Probably one of the
most frequent guests,

01:12:50.810 --> 01:12:52.510
and they had an incredible
rapport.

01:12:52.510 --> 01:12:55.270
I'll suggest a partner
archive of ours

01:12:55.270 --> 01:12:57.450
which is a video archive
called Media Burn,

01:12:57.450 --> 01:12:59.270
consists of Chicago based video,

01:12:59.270 --> 01:13:01.450
and they have some
fantastic footage of Studs

01:13:01.450 --> 01:13:04.520
and [inaudible], including a
long passage of [inaudible]

01:13:04.520 --> 01:13:09.030
in the Billy Goat Tavern
talking about Chicago softball

01:13:09.030 --> 01:13:11.960
and how it is to run a Chicago
softball team, particularly

01:13:11.960 --> 01:13:13.260
when you're playing, you know,

01:13:13.260 --> 01:13:14.560
teams of cops and
things like that.

01:13:14.560 --> 01:13:15.860
It's a great.

01:13:15.860 --> 01:13:18.190
You want to, [inaudible]
vision of Chicago softball

01:13:18.190 --> 01:13:20.510
in 20 minutes, it's
pretty priceless.

01:13:23.410 --> 01:13:26.940
No. No.

01:13:26.940 --> 01:13:29.850
&gt;&gt; Is there any contact between
Studs Terkel and [inaudible]?

01:13:29.850 --> 01:13:36.100
Because George wrote fables
and slang, you know, the 1900s.

01:13:36.100 --> 01:13:37.400
&gt;&gt; Tony Macalus: Yeah.

01:13:37.400 --> 01:13:38.700
Yeah.

01:13:38.700 --> 01:13:41.860
&gt;&gt; And, I think he, there were
the intersected at some point

01:13:41.860 --> 01:13:43.710
because I think [inaudible]
died in the '40s.

01:13:43.710 --> 01:13:45.010
&gt;&gt; Tony Macalus: He did.

01:13:45.010 --> 01:13:47.490
Anyone else want to jump in, or
I can say a few words about it.

01:13:47.490 --> 01:13:49.760
Yeah, there is, I think there's
one place, if I remember right

01:13:49.760 --> 01:13:52.220
in the archive of Studs
reading a George Abe story,

01:13:52.220 --> 01:13:54.810
and obviously just, you
know, that whole generation

01:13:54.810 --> 01:13:57.520
of Chicago journalists
from the 1890s

01:13:57.520 --> 01:13:59.370
and early 20th century were big,

01:13:59.370 --> 01:14:01.900
big influences for
Studs as well.

01:14:01.900 --> 01:14:04.700
But, not an interview
with him in the archive.

01:14:04.700 --> 01:14:06.810
The radio archive
begins in 1952,

01:14:06.810 --> 01:14:09.960
so he would have missed
out in that way, too.

[ Inaudible Comment ]

01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:28.590
&gt;&gt; John Sayles: You know, for
me, people are always saying,

01:14:28.590 --> 01:14:31.290
you know, you think Joe Jackson
should be in the Hall of Fame?

01:14:31.290 --> 01:14:34.430
You know, and I always, you
know, I feel like the same thing

01:14:34.430 --> 01:14:37.140
with Sammy Sosa and
all of these things.

01:14:37.140 --> 01:14:40.810
When Roger Maris
first, you know,

01:14:40.810 --> 01:14:43.440
it looked like he was
going to, you know,

01:14:43.440 --> 01:14:46.020
break Babe Ruth's record and
when Hank Aaron finally did,

01:14:46.020 --> 01:14:50.210
you know, they put an asterisk
next to his record saying, well,

01:14:50.210 --> 01:14:51.660
he played in more games.

01:14:51.660 --> 01:14:54.270
And, it was a different game
and everything like that.

01:14:54.270 --> 01:14:58.220
And, I always feel like
there should be, you know,

01:14:58.220 --> 01:15:00.270
whether it's O.J.
Simpson or anything else.

01:15:00.270 --> 01:15:01.570
You don't take their
records away.

01:15:01.570 --> 01:15:05.180
You put as asterisk
next to them, you know,

01:15:05.180 --> 01:15:07.300
so Pete Rose, you know.

01:15:07.300 --> 01:15:09.160
Great player.

01:15:09.160 --> 01:15:13.220
Personally, he's
got the asterisk.

01:15:13.220 --> 01:15:14.850
For me, one of the
fascinating things

01:15:14.850 --> 01:15:18.590
about the story was it
was about corruption.

01:15:18.590 --> 01:15:22.500
And, it reminded me originally
of "All the Presidents Men",

01:15:22.500 --> 01:15:25.820
of how people become corrupted
and corrupt each other

01:15:25.820 --> 01:15:30.660
and how many conspiracies
don't work.

01:15:30.660 --> 01:15:32.350
And, the ones that
don't work are the ones

01:15:32.350 --> 01:15:34.100
where the people are
a little bit ashamed

01:15:34.100 --> 01:15:35.400
of what they're doing.

01:15:35.400 --> 01:15:37.710
They don't have enough meetings.

01:15:37.710 --> 01:15:42.530
So, the [inaudible] like two
mass meetings about are we in

01:15:42.530 --> 01:15:43.890
or are we out and
what we're doing.

01:15:43.890 --> 01:15:45.610
So, there were guys who
thought they were only going

01:15:45.610 --> 01:15:48.270
to throw one game who
were saying, "What?

01:15:48.270 --> 01:15:50.940
Are we throwing this one or
are we winning this one?"

01:15:50.940 --> 01:15:53.300
Because they didn't
have enough meetings.

01:15:53.300 --> 01:15:57.640
And, I think what's fascinating,
you know, about it is, yes,

01:15:57.640 --> 01:16:01.550
it was a labor situation,
but they did, also,

01:16:01.550 --> 01:16:03.600
sell their own teammates out.

01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:04.970
They didn't let them in on it,

01:16:04.970 --> 01:16:06.600
and their teammates
were trying to win.

01:16:06.600 --> 01:16:08.210
So, it's a, you know, it's a,

01:16:08.210 --> 01:16:10.240
you can't really make
heroes of these guys.

01:16:10.240 --> 01:16:12.580
And, some of them,
like Joe Jackson,

01:16:12.580 --> 01:16:14.100
were just brow beat into it.

01:16:14.100 --> 01:16:16.100
You don't want to
be who, you know,

01:16:16.100 --> 01:16:18.160
messes it all up, do you, Joe?

01:16:18.160 --> 01:16:20.850
And, you know, he was
afraid of these guys.

01:16:20.850 --> 01:16:22.670
And then, others did it
because they were greedy.

01:16:22.670 --> 01:16:25.300
Some did it because they
felt like they were right

01:16:25.300 --> 01:16:26.920
on the verge of being
out of [inaudible].

01:16:26.920 --> 01:16:31.720
But, how people become corrupted
and accept a bad situation

01:16:31.720 --> 01:16:34.830
and don't fight against
it in the right way.

01:16:34.830 --> 01:16:38.610
I think that's a, you know,
it's a nice little microcosm.

01:16:38.610 --> 01:16:41.730
Just like it was, you know,
with the Brooklyn Dodgers

01:16:41.730 --> 01:16:44.070
when Jackie Robinson,
you know, played.

01:16:44.070 --> 01:16:46.210
There were guys who said, "Well,
I'm not playing with him."

01:16:46.210 --> 01:16:49.210
And, they ended up being, like,
"He's my teammate, and I'll,

01:16:49.210 --> 01:16:52.520
if you mess with him, I'm
going to punch you out."

01:16:52.520 --> 01:16:57.650
You know, human beings are,
this is the essence of Studs.

01:16:57.650 --> 01:17:02.920
Human beings are strange and
wonderful creatures, and you,

01:17:02.920 --> 01:17:04.690
and everyone's an individual.

01:17:04.690 --> 01:17:08.650
And, you can't just say, he's
a, you know, Hispanic American

01:17:08.650 --> 01:17:12.230
in his 30s and therefore
he thinks or is this.

01:17:12.230 --> 01:17:14.940
You got to talk to the
guy and bring it out.

01:17:14.940 --> 01:17:17.510
And, everybody's
got their own story.

01:17:19.060 --> 01:17:20.650
&gt;&gt; Allison Schein Holmes:
Any final questions?

01:17:20.650 --> 01:17:22.600
&gt;&gt; Tony Macalus: And, if not,

01:17:22.600 --> 01:17:24.800
maybe we can just
run [inaudible]

01:17:24.800 --> 01:17:26.880
up here has a final
thought or comment

01:17:26.880 --> 01:17:28.980
or a notion to leave
people with.

01:17:28.980 --> 01:17:31.130
So, we can start on either side.

01:17:31.130 --> 01:17:33.060
&gt;&gt; John Sayles: And, you wanted
to tell the story of Studs.

01:17:33.060 --> 01:17:34.360
&gt;&gt; Derek Goldman: Yeah
[inaudible] story about Studs.

01:17:34.360 --> 01:17:35.660
&gt;&gt; Tony Macalus: And, I have

01:17:35.660 --> 01:17:36.960
to tell the story
about Studs, yeah.

01:17:36.960 --> 01:17:38.260
In the meantime, can you bring

01:17:38.260 --> 01:17:39.560
up that photo of
Studs [inaudible].

01:17:39.560 --> 01:17:42.360
Yeah. So. But, that's
first Derek,

01:17:42.360 --> 01:17:45.110
anything you wanted
to throw out?

01:17:45.110 --> 01:17:46.410
&gt;&gt; Derek Goldman:
Nothing [inaudible].

01:17:46.410 --> 01:17:47.710
&gt;&gt; Tony Macalus: So, just
bring up a photo here.

01:17:47.710 --> 01:17:49.670
So, I mentioned the
beginning of the program

01:17:49.670 --> 01:17:52.100
that Studs didn't get much
chance to play baseball

01:17:52.100 --> 01:17:53.630
and other sports
when he was young.

01:17:53.630 --> 01:17:55.490
And, the photo that you're
going to see here is taken

01:17:55.490 --> 01:17:59.660
on Studs' 90th birthday
when he was invited to throw

01:17:59.660 --> 01:18:02.100
out the first pitch for
the Chicago White Sox,

01:18:02.100 --> 01:18:04.900
and his neighbors, across
the street neighbors,

01:18:04.900 --> 01:18:09.280
Bob and Laura Watson, bought
him a baseball glove and a hat.

01:18:09.280 --> 01:18:10.940
And, they got him the wrong hat.

01:18:10.940 --> 01:18:12.820
You'll see this in a moment.

01:18:12.820 --> 01:18:15.190
Never got the full
story behind that.

01:18:15.190 --> 01:18:18.000
And, they invited, just Laura
in particular, the wife,

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:21.950
invited him to play
catch, I think just once.

01:18:21.950 --> 01:18:23.920
And, Studs got such a thrill
out it that apparently, then,

01:18:23.920 --> 01:18:27.120
Studs would go back to Laura's
house in the weeks leading

01:18:27.120 --> 01:18:29.730
up to the, across the street
leading up to the game

01:18:29.730 --> 01:18:31.480
when he was throwing out the
first pitch and just knock

01:18:31.480 --> 01:18:33.730
on the door with his
baseball glove in hand

01:18:33.730 --> 01:18:35.030
and say, "Is Laura home?

01:18:35.030 --> 01:18:36.350
Would you like to play catch?"

01:18:36.350 --> 01:18:40.230
So, as a 90-year-old,
so, and there he is.

01:18:40.230 --> 01:18:42.370
Oh. He disappeared quickly.

01:18:42.370 --> 01:18:43.670
He was here in a flash.

01:18:43.670 --> 01:18:44.970
There he was.

01:18:44.970 --> 01:18:46.270
Well, come and gone.

01:18:46.270 --> 01:18:47.570
Oh, back again.

01:18:47.570 --> 01:18:48.870
So, just I think there's a
certain beauty in the fact

01:18:48.870 --> 01:18:51.110
that what he missed out
on in some ways as a kid

01:18:51.110 --> 01:18:53.210
which is what led him
into this love of radio

01:18:53.210 --> 01:18:56.170
and different kinds of music
and being engaged in politics,

01:18:56.170 --> 01:18:58.540
listening to the Presidential
convention while he was,

01:18:58.540 --> 01:19:02.040
you know, in this rest
home as an eight-year-old.

01:19:02.040 --> 01:19:05.410
He did finally get to make up
and play some catch and throw

01:19:05.410 --> 01:19:08.770
out the first pitch for
the White Sox in 2002.

01:19:08.770 --> 01:19:11.850
So, with that, we saw him
for just a flash of a second,

01:19:11.850 --> 01:19:13.150
but maybe he'll come back.

01:19:13.150 --> 01:19:14.450
We'll see.

01:19:14.450 --> 01:19:15.750
&gt;&gt; Allison Schein
Holmes: Sorry about that.

01:19:15.750 --> 01:19:17.050
&gt;&gt; Tony Macalus: He's, the
spirit of Studs is eluding us

01:19:17.050 --> 01:19:18.350
at the moment, but
he'll be here.

01:19:18.350 --> 01:19:19.650
We can.
