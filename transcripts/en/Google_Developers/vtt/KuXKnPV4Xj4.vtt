JOANNA SMITH: Hi, everybody and
welcome back to "Google+

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:12.450
Developers Live." I'm
Joanna Smith.

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.350
And I'm a Developer Programs
Engineer for Google+.

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:17.640
And today I'm being joined by
two Product Managers, Thor and

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.590
Joel, to talk about the new
Google+ Domains API.

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:22.940
We launched this at I/O.
We announced it

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:24.160
anyway, this summer.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.010
And we're really excited because
now it's finally

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.530
publicly available.

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:29.400
So Joel, why don't you tell us
a little bit about why we

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:29.995
built this.

00:00:29.995 --> 00:00:31.200
JOEL KALMANOWICZ:
Thanks, Joanna.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.360
I'm Joel Kalmanowicz.

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.060
I'm a Product Manager
on Google Apps.

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:35.340
And I focus on Google+.

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.590
Now, the intersection of Google
Apps and Google+ is

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:38.770
enterprise social networking.

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:40.930
And we're really excited in this
space because we can do

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.040
things with Google+ that we
can't really do out in the

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:44.350
consumer public world.

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.440
Because enterprises, being
businesses and schools, use a

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.170
lot of third-party tools for
other purposes in the day to

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:51.950
day life of a professional.

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:54.630
This means we can integrate
Google+ as a social spine

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:57.410
across other services and not
just have to build things onto

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:58.610
Google+ itself.

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:00.770
JOANNA SMITH: Well, thanks
for joining us, Joel.

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:02.840
Thor, can you give us some
insight into some of the new

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.381
features that are special for
the Google+ Domains API?

00:01:06.381 --> 00:01:06.880
THOR MITCHELL: Sure.

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:07.790
Hi, my name is Thor Mitchell.

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.370
I'm a Product Manager
for the Google+ API.

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:12.530
When we started working with
the Enterprise Team on this

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.000
API, it became clear.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.570
There are a couple of areas
that we should focus on.

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:18.970
The first is Circle Management,
so creating

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.020
circles and syncing circles to,
for example, a corporate

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.080
directory, managing
people in circles.

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.160
The second was the stream, so
both understanding the way

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.740
that users within a domain are
using the stream and what

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.150
they're posting, what they're
sharing and commenting on, and

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.570
also allowing third-party
applications

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:35.830
to post to the stream.

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:36.820
JOANNA SMITH: Thanks, Thor.

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.460
So I know we just teased you
with some really cool features

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.070
that you want to get
to know how to use.

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.810
So let's go ahead and take a
look at how you can do this.

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:45.320
The first step, as always,
is to go to

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.340
developers.google.com/+/domains
And this is going to be your

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:50.790
gateway into learning
what is up.

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.780
We tried to do what we could
really do to help you out.

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.600
So we organized the entire left
navigation bar by feature

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.500
and by what you might
want to do.

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.980
So straight up, let's
get started.

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:04.170
And what we did here is, we
created a chart, that I think

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.970
is really fantastic.

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.850
Because it compares the existing
Google+ API to the

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.479
Google+ Domains API, and this
means that if you've already

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.840
been developing for Google,
you can see what's new and

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.070
what's different that you might
want to start exploring

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:16.110
right away.

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.360
And then, of course,
we have two quick

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:18.900
starts Java and Python.

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.050
And the best thing about these
is, they show off a different

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:22.580
type of authentication.

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.805
Because everybody has started
to get a grasp now of server

00:02:25.805 --> 00:02:28.590
side OAuth authentication
where you can actually

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.730
authenticate on a user-by-user
basis.

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.580
And we have the code here
for you, to show

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:33.710
you how to do that.

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:36.100
But what's cool is, we also
now have domain-wide

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:37.170
delegation.

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.470
And what this means is, instead
of authenticating one

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.010
user at a time, you can actually
authenticate an app

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.600
on behalf of all of the users
within a domain at once.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:46.880
JOEL KALMANOWICZ: It's important
to note that this

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.000
functionality is only available

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.490
to the domain admins.

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:51.720
And it's exactly the same as
it works with other Google

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.770
Apps APIs, such as
the Drive API.

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:57.010
So this allows Google Apps
admins to be able to say, yes,

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.280
it's OK for this app to
authorize on behalf of anyone

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.660
in the domain, because they're
essentially installing a

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.390
product for their entire
systems across

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:05.815
their business or school.

00:03:05.815 --> 00:03:07.690
JOANNA SMITH: Definitely,
that's exactly right.

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:09.990
And because this is so different
from what we've

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:12.800
historically offered for the
Google+ platform, we decided

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.780
to make this the main
authentication we use in our

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:15.290
quick start.

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.240
So if you'd like to see it
running, you can go ahead and

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:20.400
download that from our GitHub
repo and get started.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.520
And then what we have is
different things that you

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:24.880
might want to do, different
API calls you

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:25.880
might want to make.

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.360
They're classic, getting
profiles, with your

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:28.310
people.get.

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:29.910
We also have managing circles.

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:33.210
And what we have here are
multiple ways for you to

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:35.600
actually make sure your
circles are all

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:36.570
constantly up to date.

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:38.840
And Thor mentioned this briefly
earlier, but you can

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:39.770
create circles.

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:41.170
You can delete circles.

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:43.450
You can add people or move
people, see the people that

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:45.610
are in a circle, see the circles
that a person has.

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:48.720
there are so many different
things you can do, to help

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.910
make sure that your circle
management is as easy

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:52.470
as it should be.

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.170
Then we have the ability
for you to read posts.

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:57.740
And what's really cool about
this is that, it's no longer

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:00.680
limited to just the posts that
have been publicly shared.

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.380
And so we've got the code
here for you to do it.

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:05.290
But Thor, do you want to take
a moment to explain what's

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:06.790
different about the
domain sharing?

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:07.890
THOR MITCHELL: Sure.

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:11.075
So when you're using the
existing public Google+ API

00:04:11.075 --> 00:04:13.270
that we've had for a
while now, you can

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:15.340
authenticate as yourself.

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:18.360
But then, the API only offers
access to content that you've

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:19.470
shared publicly.

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:23.530
In the Google+ Domains API, as
a user in an apps domain, the

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:26.040
API can access any of the
content that you've shared

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.900
with any audience.

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.830
However, when you post using the
API, you can only create a

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:32.460
restricted post, which
is a post that

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:33.812
cannot leave that domain.

00:04:33.812 --> 00:04:34.640
JOANNA SMITH: Exactly.

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:37.780
So let's go ahead and take a
look at how to create a post.

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:39.400
And it's pretty straightforward.

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.410
All you have to do is create the
message you want to say,

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:44.210
create the body.

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:45.710
And that's going to
be the content.

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:48.740
And what we have here in this
Python is, we have the post

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:51.430
being created through an
activities.insert call.

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:54.880
And it's done as
a JSON object.

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:57.030
So you see, we sent the original
content, which is

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:59.050
just your message that
you want to say.

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:01.860
And then what we do is,
we set the sharing.

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:04.390
And right here, this one is
being shared with the domain.

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:06.080
And then, of course, we set
the domain restricted

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:07.130
parameter to True.

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:10.160
This has to be the case on every
single call you make to

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:10.690
activities.insert.

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:13.420
Or else it's going to fail
because you cannot post beyond

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:14.620
your domain.

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:17.350
And then, also, on this page,
we have how to share to a

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:19.540
specific circle, how to
share to a person,

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:20.770
how to write a comment.

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:23.190
But even cooler, you'll
see on the left now.

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:26.040
We show you how to attach URLs,
how to attach media, if

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:28.930
you want to attach a photo or a
video, and also how to do a

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:30.560
reshare programmatically.

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.640
So there's a lot for you
to discover here at

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:36.340
developers.googl
e.com/+/domains.

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:37.880
Let's go ahead and take
a step back and look

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:38.990
at the bigger picture.

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:41.050
We talked about some of the
really cool features in the

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:41.840
new API calls.

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:43.250
But maybe we should discuss
some of the

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:44.365
use cases for them.

00:05:44.365 --> 00:05:46.000
JOEL KALMANOWICZ: So as I said
before, one of the main

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.490
motivations we had for
developing this is because, in

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:50.330
the enterprise space, for
businesses and schools,

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:53.040
usually you're users and you
admins are already making use

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:54.830
of a lot of third-party tools.

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:56.240
They can be things like
provisioning.

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:58.380
They can be customer reference
management.

00:05:58.380 --> 00:05:59.620
They can be all sorts
of things.

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:01.160
For schools, especially,
you can have

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.410
learning management systems.

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:05.610
So this means that, actually,
one of the really cool things

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:08.590
for me is, in this API, we
allow circles management.

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:11.340
So this means that, working
with Ocado, we've actually

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:14.620
developed a little cool script
that lets you pull data from

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:17.920
something like a file or Active
Directory or LDAP.

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:19.920
And you can actually look at
this hierarchical data and

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:21.220
turn it into circles.

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:24.280
So a new user can join a company
and start off with

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:27.790
teammates, managers, executives,
people that you

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:30.210
should be following, or your
local chefs because everyone

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:32.480
loves them, especially
here at Google.

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:34.310
Or even in school, you can
start, and you can have your

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:36.596
classmates circle ready to go.

00:06:36.596 --> 00:06:38.610
THOR MITCHELL: As far as
stream integration is

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:40.860
concerned, there are a
couple of clear use

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:41.860
cases there as well.

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:45.670
One is, you might have an
existing CRM system or Content

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:47.870
Management System or some
other software that you

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:50.510
licensed from a third-party
enterprise software vendor.

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:52.720
And they might add functionality
to their tool

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:54.150
that allows that tool
to publish to the

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:55.250
stream on your behalf.

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:59.520
So for example, I want you to
meet a sales target or to

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:01.530
share your counter for
the day on Google+ or

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:02.970
something like that.

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:06.150
Another example is reporting
and auditing.

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:09.450
We have an example, a CloudLock,
that we mentioned

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:13.860
in the launch blog post, which
creates tools for helping you

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:15.570
understand your employees
are using

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:17.610
Google+ and other services.

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:19.810
JOANNA SMITH: So I think there
might be some confusion

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:23.220
regarding who can develop for
Google+ and for the Domains

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:24.130
API specifically.

00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:25.220
Joel, do you want
to clarify that?

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:26.100
JOEL KALMANOWICZ: Sure.

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:27.060
Anyone can develop.

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:28.830
The only thing is, in
order actually test,

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:30.050
using real API calls.

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:32.340
And to authenticate, you have
to be logged in to a real

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:34.310
Google Apps Domain account.

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:36.570
So if you try and make an
account which is not a Google

00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:39.130
Apps Domains account, that
means things that, as you

00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:41.830
might be familiar with Premier
or Standard, then you won't be

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:44.296
able to make these API
calls successfully.

00:07:44.296 --> 00:07:45.670
JOANNA SMITH: All right.

00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:48.140
Well, thanks so much for
joining us, you guys.

00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:51.010
And I want to thank all of you
for joining and tuning in,

00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:55.150
because this is a really
exciting new API,

00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:55.950
totally brand new.

00:07:55.950 --> 00:07:58.330
We announced it, like I said,
at I/O. But now it's finally

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:00.220
public, and I encourage
you to get started.

00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:03.450
And once again, if you want to
learn what all we have to

00:08:03.450 --> 00:08:04.245
offer, you can go to
developers.googl

00:08:04.245 --> 00:08:07.210
e.com/+/domains.

00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:09.650
Or if you want to just see some
code running already, you

00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:12.140
can go to github.com/googleplus
and look

00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:15.040
for the gplus-domains repos,
because those are the ones

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:18.540
that are going to have the
Domains quick starts.

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:20.675
And then, of course, you can
always ask your questions.

00:08:20.675 --> 00:08:23.200
THOR MITCHELL: Yeah, so I
encourage you to join our

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:26.142
Google+ community called,
Developing with Google+.

00:08:26.142 --> 00:08:28.820
If you want to discuss this
API with like-minded

00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:29.710
developers.

00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:36.480
We also have a Public Issue
track, search for Google+

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:37.440
Issue Tracker.

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:41.110
And that's where you can go to
request new features or report

00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:42.159
any problems you might find.

00:08:42.159 --> 00:08:43.970
JOEL KALMANOWICZ: And for any
technical questions, you can

00:08:43.970 --> 00:08:45.460
always submit them at
Stack Overflow.

00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:47.640
Please be sure to use
the tag google-plus.

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:48.490
JOANNA SMITH: Exactly.

00:08:48.490 --> 00:08:49.800
So once again, thanks,
you guys.

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:52.710
And thank you to our product
managers for joining us today.

00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:54.990
And right before we sign off, I
have one announcement, which

00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:57.380
is, please don't freak out if
you don't see a "Google+

00:08:57.380 --> 00:09:00.480
Developers Live" episode next
week or the week after.

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:02.450
We are planning something really
big in our brand new

00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:03.520
series of episodes.

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:05.990
But we need some time to
finalize that and really make

00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:07.730
sure that we're doing
a great job.

00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:10.540
So we ask for your patience, as
we take a brief hiatus from

00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:12.780
"Google+ Developers Live."
And on that note,

00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:14.030
have a great week.
