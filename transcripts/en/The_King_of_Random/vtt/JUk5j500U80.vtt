00:00:03.189 --> 00:00:05.080
Haha, that was so cool

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:06.660
What's up guys you got to check this out?

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.740
I just ordered a hundred and fifty feet of Chinese fireworks fuse, so in this video

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:15.029
We're going to have some fun with it now because firework safety fuse is technically a pyrotechnic

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.979
I've moved away most things that are flammable and fire safety protocols are in place

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.279
Now here's the premise behind this experiment guys this particular fuse is three millimeters?

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.359
And it's specifically designed to burn one inch in about one and a half to two seconds

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:30.449
But after I spend some time playing with these fuses it made me wonder

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.828
What would happen if we tried making them thicker so to help me take on that challenge today?

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.869
I'm bringing back the rope making machine. We made the previous project so we can wind ourselves a very thick and very dangerous

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.739
Pyrotechnic rope now you guys remember how the rope making Machine works?

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.558
We take a piece of string and we thread it back and forth around the spinner hook

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.360
But instead of using string for this one

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.190
We're going to be using the firework fuse itself

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.259
And I'm thinking we probably have enough of it that we can get about three to four strands per hook for a total of 12

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.649
Which should give us a rope about three and a half centimeters thick all right?

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.749
So let's go round up the fuse and rig the machine

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.250
All right, quick update guys. I went ahead and threaded the machine with our firework fuse

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.639
And I thought we were going to get about three to four firework fuses per hook

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.590
We ended up getting seven per hook for a total of Twenty-one fuses going into this rope?

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.030
Which is absolutely insane!

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:49.760
That means this rope is going to end up nearly six and a half centimeters thick which is twice as big and probably a lot

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.279
More powerful than I was expecting you can see on the ends over here

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.809
I just took some purple electrical tape and wound all the lines together to keep them tight loop them into a

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:57.530
swivel Hook

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.890
And now all we have to do is take our power drill and hook it to the back and when we press the button

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.909
We should be able to watch our rope wind itself . Here we go. Let's make some rope

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.969
That's pretty cool. Okay. You can see there's a lot of tension being wound into these strings right now

00:02:23.969 --> 00:02:26.820
They're they're not super tight, but if we start letting this go forward

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.140
It definitely is creating a pretty cool firework fusing rope

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.100
It's pretty

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:42.599
It's not really self-winding. I do have to make small adjustments because it's not quite as slick as using a string, but you can see

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:45.099
It is working

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:46.659
That's a rope

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:48.659
That's a fuse rope

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:57.570
boom there it is

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.440
That's cool. Look at that

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.619
That's finish up pretty nicely. You know I bet that strong if you could actually climb on it

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:12.899
Alright, so I'm going to release a live with attention here and watch it Spin, and it so it doesn't even spin, okay?

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.550
Just pull it tight for a second and then see if there's any attention left in it, okay

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:22.529
So that behaves a little bit differently than our ropes with the string not quite as much tension in it

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.310
That could have been a bit cleaner

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:40.150
So check this out guys. We have done it

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.150
We have taken 21 strands of firework fuse and wound them together

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:47.739
To produce a legitimate firework fuse rope and this stuff is robust

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:52.359
this is sturdy like this is the kind of stuff you could actually like throw over the side of a cliff and rappel down and

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:56.079
I'm pretty sure it's going to hold your weight. No problem. The coolest thing is when you got to the bottom

00:03:56.079 --> 00:04:01.059
You could literally light it on fire, and the whole rope would disappear. I'm not sure what kind of practical purpose

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.089
that it would actually serve unless you were running away from pirates and trying to burn your trail

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:08.200
But there you have it a firework fuse rope that we need to go test out

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.250
That's cool. It actually functions just like a rope I

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:13.930
I just came outside guys

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:18.039
And I actually tied the rope to my basketball hoop and raised it up in the air because I know some of you are going

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:21.249
To want to know how durable this rope is. Is it strong enough to hold my bodyweight

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:23.250
So I'm going to swing on up for you right now

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:28.479
No problem

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:32.380
As you can see the rope is very very durable

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:36.789
It's not super nice to grab on to the hands, but what rope is really let's go light it up

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:41.710
Just for fun. I cleaned up all the remnants from the fuse pack them down to this glass. We're gonna light those off first

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:45.729
I'm just going to start by lighting one of these fuses, and we'll see what happens here. We go

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:48.490
Whoop that's fast

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:58.510
Haha, that was so cool. Oh my goodness. That was cool. So those fuses went off a lot faster than I was expecting

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:01.929
It's burning very very quickly and once it got in there the whole thing just

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:07.989
Erupted and all these little pieces of fuse went flying and raining down all over the area that was pretty cool

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:10.419
What's the rope going to do let's find out next?

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:13.389
This is my throwing board I use for the Batarang video

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:17.739
I've got the rope hanging down to simulate if we were going over the side of a cliff if we let the bottom and all

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:21.639
The heat transferred upward how much of a difference is that going to make but blade it off to find out?

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:31.199
Wow

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:32.830
Oh my goodness

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:35.580
That got hot in a hurry that that went up

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:41.159
So freaking fast that was so hot I could feel the heat from about ten feet away and look at my throwing board here

00:05:41.159 --> 00:05:46.649
It's completely charred along the front edge if you look down the ground you can hear pieces of the fuse still sizzling and popping

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:49.710
that went off really fast

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:52.229
Absolutely Incredible I'm blown away

00:05:52.449 --> 00:05:56.218
That was a lot faster than one and a half to two seconds per inch wouldn't you say I mean?

00:05:56.219 --> 00:06:00.659
I think that whole thing went off in about four seconds flat can't wait to see the slow-mo on that. Oh

00:06:01.899 --> 00:06:06.449
My goodness looking at the high-speed all you see is this burning ball of yellow

00:06:06.909 --> 00:06:09.629
Traveling upwards that was an enormous amount of heat

00:06:09.629 --> 00:06:14.218
I mean, I was like 10 feet away, and I could feel the heat radiating it look I'm sweating

00:06:14.219 --> 00:06:15.210
I mean, it's hot out here

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:19.649
But I'm sweating because of that flame. I mean I know we had that thing hanging downwards, so the heat could travel up

00:06:19.649 --> 00:06:24.779
But it still blows me away. How quickly that burned! Once it took off, it was just gone in a matter of seconds

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:28.979
exploding pieces of Debris and little pieces of fuse raining down from the sky

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:30.870
absolutely fantastic

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:34.649
That's exactly what I came here for I'm feeling satisfied. Let's call it a day

00:06:35.139 --> 00:06:40.588
So there you have a guy's an epic day experimenting with what just might be the world's most pyrotechnic rope

00:06:40.689 --> 00:06:45.539
I'm glad nobody got hurt hey, thanks for joining it for this experiment. I'll be looking for you the next one. Talk to you then

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:48.270
Here we go

00:06:49.029 --> 00:06:51.029
Aha False alarm when you hit that again

00:06:54.759 --> 00:06:56.759
Cool

00:06:57.999 --> 00:06:59.999
Okay up sit down

00:07:03.339 --> 00:07:05.339
Yep, that's pretty durable. Hey
