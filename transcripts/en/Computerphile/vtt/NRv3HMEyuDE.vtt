00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.680
Greyscale pictures from interplanetary
space were actually sent back from Mars

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.480
to Earth from the mid 60s onwards and
yeah, I mean, we call these

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.109
black-and-white pictures. As you all know
by now they're not; they're really

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:27.240
greyscale pictures. The scale used at the
time was one of 64 shades, and if I put that

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:36.000
there, black was shade 63 actually, and over
here, probably just off the page, is

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:43.140
shade 0 which is white. Interplanetary
space - and you're transmitting radio

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.539
signals with the shades of grey on - it's
a very noisy place! There's X-rays,

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.699
gamma rays, cosmic rays generally. There's
solar sunspots, flares, everything. The

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.960
amount of radio noise is quite
considerable. And what this means is that

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:04.049
typically up to 25% of your
shade-of-grey pixels, in your photos,

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:09.479
can get corrupted in flight. If you look
at these two pictures - that one there is

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.680
actually very fuzzy. And then you look at
the sky you might think: "Ooh! there's lots

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.509
and lots of quasars and tiny stars there!"
No - no it's not - it's noise. And if you

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.729
compare it with the other one, that's being
cleaned up, you can see the contours on

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:30.479
Mars are sharper, the sky is much blacker.
So that's the idea then. You've got noisy

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:37.020
photos and noisy greyscale pictures
being sent back. How do you correct them

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.100
and get them to look really, really good?
The early Mariners just did a flyby of

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:47.880
the planets. I think Mariner 3 -
unbelievable this - did a flyby and then

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.909
transmitted the results back at 8
bits per second, for a 200 x 200 pixel

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:59.850
array. It "only" took 8 hours! Part of
the problem, of space being so noisy, is

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.619
that you cannot start having [bit rates of]
Megabits per second between the planets. In fact

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:09.959
Dr. Bagley, Dr. Steve, was talking to me
about this yesterday and saying: "What

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:15.190
bit-rate did they get on Mariner 9 ?"
And the answer is 16 kilobits per second.

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:22.150
Also don't forget that, at the time that
the Mariner 9 venture took place, roughly

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:27.940
speaking, it took radio signals 9
minutes to get from Earth to Mars. Now

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.470
you realize, this is a moveable feast.
Because it depends where Earth and Mars

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.700
are, relative to one another, in their
orbits. I think - I looked up - it can be

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:42.459
anything between 6 minutes and 23 minutes and 
at Mariner 9 time it was 9 minutes. So the

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:46.930
other thing to say is - to those of you
sceptics who say: "Oh! we got a corrupted

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.609
picture. Why not send back a signal and
ask it to transmit again". Are you joking ?!

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:57.519
you're gonna spend ... y'know, it took
9 minutes to get [it]. You've got 9 minutes to get

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:01.450
a NOT ACKNOWLEDGE signal back to Mars. And
then wait another 9 minutes to

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:06.609
hopefully get a better one that doesn't
get corrupted?  27 minutes!  No, I mean you

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:11.859
can forget any idea of tight interaction
with planetary spacecraft. You cannot do

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:16.180
that and this I think does bring it home
to those of you say: "Well, if in doubt, just

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:21.430
send it again". No, you can't do that. Here
is the real case where you've got to

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:27.760
pack enough check-bits around the
message that you can clean it up without

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:33.970
asking for a retransmit. Even when you've
got the pictures back and you see all

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:40.419
this corruption you think: "Oh heck! how
clever can I be? How am I going to clean

00:03:40.419 --> 00:03:50.019
these up?" And let me just remind you, once
again, about how you measure payload

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:56.799
vs. correction-bits, and so on, and
then I'll reveal to you what ratios

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:04.720
between those were actually used in
Mariner 9.  [n, k, d] notation. That is total

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:11.260
number of bits per codeword. The codeword is 
basically saying: "Here is the

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:15.120
package. It's got the message bits in it,
packed around with

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:20.459
parity-checking bits, to make sure
it gets through OK" And the idea of

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:25.770
this game is to keep the code words as
far 'distant' as possible. And by 'distance'

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:31.080
what we're saying is: Take a codeword,
take another codeword. Look at how many

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:36.479
places in the bit-patterns are different
and that is your 'distance'. And the bigger

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:42.030
you can keep that distance apart the
more chance you have that the corruption,

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:46.080
and damage, won't mislead you.
&gt;&gt; Sean: It's like you want to send a parcel 
of eggs somewhere.

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:49.590
It's how much packing you put in isn't it? 
&gt;&gt; DFB: Yes it is!
&gt;&gt; Sean: And physically how far the eggs ...

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:53.850
&gt;&gt; DFB Yes, how far apart are they?
Exactly so! And of course the further

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:58.080
apart you put your eggs the bigger the
package gets, with lots of fluffy, woolly

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:02.820
stuff in, keeping them apart from one
another. Yes, it's it's quite right!

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:09.030
That's exactly what it is. OK, so total bits per
codeword is 'n'.  'k' is the [number of] message bits

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:13.440
the payload, the ones that really count.
These are the things that are going to

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:19.650
communicate which of your 64 shades of
grey that pixel is, And just remember,

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:25.740
because it's sobering, every one of these
great long [bit] strings we send is giving you

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:32.520
the colour of one pixel.  At Mariner 6
time it was a 200 x 200 grid; by Mariner 9

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:38.910
- you see you make a rod for your own
back - it had gone up to 700 x 832.

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:43.050
Not, perhaps, quite as good as modern video
screens. But, you know, we're  getting there.

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:48.180
So, back to this then: 'd' is that distance I
was telling you about. The people at Jet

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:53.849
Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) have got a lot of
really, really good communications

00:05:53.849 --> 00:06:00.030
engineers who are also coding theorists.
And what they came up with [was] a code to

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:07.500
answer all of these conflicting claims,
was one where the overall message length

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:15.570
is 32 bits. Packed inside that is a 6-bit
message, carefully hidden and carefully

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:21.309
protected. And the 'distance' is amazing 
It's 16. For those of you still

00:06:21.309 --> 00:06:26.409
with us, who aren't computer scientists, the
reason we've got 6 here is that 2 to the

00:06:26.409 --> 00:06:33.610
power 6:  2 x 2 x 2 x 2 - 6 times over, is
the magic 64. Which we number from 0 to

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:37.990
63 because we're computer scientists and
everything starts at zero. This distance

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:46.749
will give you a figure [for]  "number of
correctable errors." Remember this is 'd' and

00:06:46.749 --> 00:06:52.899
here's my little bit of mathematical
notation "floor ( d -1 ) / 2".

00:06:52.899 --> 00:06:56.259
What does 'floor' mean? I'll tell you in 
a minute. But let's work out the

00:06:56.259 --> 00:07:02.019
little formula in the middle. My 'd' value
is 16. OK, so on this occasion I'm

00:07:02.019 --> 00:07:09.639
finding the floor of 15/2. 15 / 2 = 7.5.
'floor of' means if you've got a decimal

00:07:09.639 --> 00:07:15.009
part to your number in there, then round
everything down. It doesn't matter even

00:07:15.009 --> 00:07:19.869
if it's 7.8, it would round down. So 'floor'
means 'round down';  'ceiling' is forcibly

00:07:19.869 --> 00:07:25.569
rounding up. What we're doing [is] 'floor' here.
floor(7.5) is 7. So this is [an] amazing

00:07:25.569 --> 00:07:30.369
performance actually. What it's saying is
that in these 32-bit packages you can

00:07:30.369 --> 00:07:36.669
have up to 7 bits go wrong. There you
are, you see  its 25%.

00:07:36.669 --> 00:07:40.719
The reason they chose this was they knew
that, roughly speaking, you could get up

00:07:40.719 --> 00:07:45.219
to 25% errors [in a codeword] depending
on whether it was a good day or a bad day

00:07:45.219 --> 00:07:50.409
for cosmic rays. at the moment, you know!
But this really worked well, 32 bits!

00:07:50.409 --> 00:07:56.139
We're in the 1960s. Older viewers will
know-  heaven sent - that fits into an IBM

00:07:56.139 --> 00:08:01.089
mainframe word. Because powerful
computers in those days - really expensive

00:08:01.089 --> 00:08:09.189
ones and even the newly emerging DEC [VAX]
mini-mainframes had 32 bits. I mean it's old

00:08:09.189 --> 00:08:14.979
hat now. Everything 32-bits being phased
out in favour of 64 [bits]. But this fitted so

00:08:14.979 --> 00:08:20.319
well. You'd got a 32-bit package six of
those hidden bits in there carrying the

00:08:20.319 --> 00:08:26.589
message - up to 7 correctable errors
inside here. And this particular code is

00:08:26.589 --> 00:08:31.810
very famous because it had been proposed
way, way back before the Mariner

00:08:31.810 --> 00:08:39.010
program, in the 1950s, as a good way of
getting lots of error-correction going

00:08:39.010 --> 00:08:44.590
inside a transmitted packet. Oh! and by
the way, even on Mariners, you know, the

00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:48.850
camera could gather information faster
than it could ever be transmitted. So the

00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:53.560
Mariners had a little tape recorder on
board and they tape recorded the scan of

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:58.000
the picture and then trickled it out,
overnight, at 16 kilobits per sec. Well,

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.920
"overnight"-  "over earth night" presumably. So
it's been a story that's gone on now for

00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:07.480
the best part of 50 more years. And I
think this is a good place to stop but some

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:12.580
of you, I know, will want to follow up
saying: "Show me how the Reed-Muller code

00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:19.900
words because I want to do it for myself.
[trailer for next video]
Well, today is hardcore coding theory,

00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:24.700
relatively speaking. It's still 64 Shades
of Grey, for those of you looking for the

00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:30.029
sequel, and remember the sequel is always
better than the original thing!
