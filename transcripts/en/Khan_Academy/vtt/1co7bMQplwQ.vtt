00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.120
- [Sal] This is Sal here with Rick Hasen,

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.340
who's a Professor of Law
at UC Irvine School of Law,

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:09.770
specializing in election law.

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:13.350
I'm here with Bradley
Smith, who's former Chairman

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:15.060
of the Federal Election Commission.

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:17.280
He's also a Professor of Law

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:19.900
at Capital University in Columbus, Ohio,

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.620
and runs the Center for
Competitive Politics.

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:25.770
So, we're here to talk about

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.370
what seems like a very
important Supreme Court case,

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:33.570
Citizens United versus Federal
Election Commission in 2010.

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.960
Could you give a little
bit of background on

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.210
what got us to this
Supreme Court decision?

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.700
- [Rick] Well, the federal government,

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.190
specifically Congress, gets
to pass laws that regulate

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.190
the financing of federal elections,

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:49.990
and then, for state and local elections,

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:52.090
that would be an issue for each state,

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:55.190
and so, Congress, going
back more than a century,

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.620
has passed laws limiting
the amount of money,

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.160
kinds of money that can be raised,

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.180
what has to be disclosed, they
passed a whole bunch of laws,

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.340
and these laws are sometimes challenged

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.420
as being unconstitutional.

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.040
The usual challenge is
that the law violates

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.470
part of the First Amendment,

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.993
which protects freedom of
speech and association,

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.160
and the specific issue in
the Citizens United case

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:27.053
had to do with the First
Amendment rights of corporations

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.820
to spend money to support
or oppose candidates

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:33.200
for federal office.

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.440
- [Bradley] Well, it is an important case,

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.380
but it is a widely misunderstood case.

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.850
The case, for example,
is not about the question

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.360
of whether, quote,
corporations are people.

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.710
We sometimes hear that.

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.650
Not a single justice on the
court, in any of the opinions,

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:49.970
addresses that issue, because
it's a longstanding doctrine

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.980
of corporate personhood
that corporations have

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:55.610
certain rights that people have

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:57.690
when they join together to associate.

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:00.240
The case is not about the question

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.690
of whether money equals speech.

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:04.020
The court has long held,

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.150
not that money is speech, but
that you can't try to limit

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:11.690
an activity which would be
protected under the Constitution,

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.610
like speech, by limiting money.

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.520
For example, you could not
say it shall be illegal

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.690
to spend any money in the
United States to publish a book

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.950
or to pay an author or to
operate a bookstore, right?

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.440
- [Rick] So, if you were,
say, General Motors or Google,

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.360
and you wanted to put
an ad online or on TV

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.870
or in a newspaper that says

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.850
support President Smith for reelection,

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.690
that would be illegal if it was paid for

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.440
with money from the corporation.

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.910
Corporations could still participate,

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.750
but they'd have to set
up a separate committee,

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.250
called a political action
committee or a PAC,

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.560
and they could only solicit certain people

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:55.810
to put money into that pack,

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:57.670
and they couldn't take
money that they made

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.170
from selling cars or software
or something like that

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.240
and use it for political purposes,

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:06.550
and in Citizens United,
reversing some earlier cases,

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:10.310
the Supreme Court said that corporations,

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:13.330
like individuals, have
a First Amendment right

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:16.090
to spend, independently,

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.800
supporting or opposing
candidates for office,

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:23.130
and that it would be
unconstitutional to limit this

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.430
because it would be too
much of an infringement

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:27.880
on the speech rights of corporations.

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.872
- [Bradley] It's about
what rights people have

00:03:30.872 --> 00:03:34.530
to engage in speech when they have chosen

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.600
to organize as a corporation,

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.880
so the court makes the
holding that corporations

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:43.350
and unions have constitutional protection

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:44.570
under the First Amendment

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:47.530
when they make independent expenditures

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:50.180
to advocate for the election
or defeat of candidates,

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.050
and by independent expenditures,

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:54.290
we don't say that they
can contribute money

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:56.180
directly to candidate campaigns,

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:58.050
but they are free to spend their own money

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:00.090
to communicate with the public at large,

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.430
and say we think you should
vote for this candidate

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.917
or against this candidate
for these reasons,

00:04:04.917 --> 00:04:07.460
and that, I think, in a nutshell,

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:11.410
is what the case is about
at that highest level.

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:13.450
- [Sal] So, just to get a
little bit more into the case,

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:17.530
it's really all around this
Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act,

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:19.330
the McCain-Feingold Act of 2002.

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:21.150
What was all that about,
and then how did that lead,

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.840
eventually, to this Supreme Court decision

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:26.390
of Citizens United versus
Federal Election Commission?

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:28.960
- [Bradley] Well, in some
ways, it goes back much further

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.540
than the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act.

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:33.920
We should note that Congress, in 1907,

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:36.700
passed the first federal
statute that limited

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:39.920
corporate contributions
to campaigns, right?

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:42.140
But corporations quickly found out, well,

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:44.140
we can just do expenditures.

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:44.973
We don't contribute to the campaign.

00:04:44.973 --> 00:04:47.430
We just spend our own money,
but within this framework,

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:51.390
both corporations and unions
could do a lot of things.

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:54.950
For example, they could run
ads that said things like,

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:59.000
you know, Congressman Jones
is a no-good, anti worker,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.760
worker line person who wants
to destroy American industry.

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.330
Call Congressman Jones and tell him

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:07.150
we don't need his agenda in Washington,

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:10.700
and that didn't count as
a campaign expenditure,

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:12.460
because it didn't specifically urge people

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:14.210
to vote for or against a candidate.

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:16.070
- [Rick] So, President Bush signed a law,

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:19.240
President George W.
Bush, signed a law called

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:22.040
the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act,

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:25.550
and this was in 2002, I believe it was,

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:28.720
and it's commonly known as
the McCain-Feingold Law,

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:31.070
because those are the
two big Senate sponsors,

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:34.339
and the National Rifle Association,

00:05:34.339 --> 00:05:36.910
Senator McConnell, a bunch of people sued

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:39.100
and argued it was unconstitutional.

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:41.970
While the case was going
through the courts,

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:43.990
the National Rifle Association,
which definitely has

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:47.600
a political point of view, set
up a satellite radio station

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:50.760
called NRA News, and they said oh, well,

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:53.290
if news organizations can
engage in this unlimited

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:55.010
kind of electoral activity,

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:57.500
we'll just make ourselves
a news organization,

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:59.980
and many people thought this
was going to be a kind of

00:06:00.981 --> 00:06:04.100
sham way of just running
political ads all the time.

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:06.950
Well, what happened was that the NRA News

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:11.940
actually started having news
programs, opinion programs,

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:13.960
call-in programs, not
just on the election,

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:15.980
but on issues that would matter to people

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:17.470
who were sympathetic to the NRA,

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:20.700
and it actually became a
bonafide news organization.

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:22.500
- [Bradley] So, the McCain-Feingold Law,

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:24.710
or the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act,

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:27.910
as it's officially known,
attempted to close this alleged

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:31.060
or perceived loophole by saying okay,

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:35.800
a corporation or a union
can't even mention a candidate

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:40.300
in a broadcast ad within 60
days of a general election,

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:43.790
or within 30 days of a primary election.

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:46.770
So, enter a group called Citizens United.

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:49.833
- [Rick] Citizens United
is an ideological group

00:06:49.833 --> 00:06:53.470
that is doing political
activities, still around,

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:58.470
and they had made a documentary
called Hillary: The Movie.

00:06:58.658 --> 00:07:01.240
This was coming out at the time,

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:04.223
not of the past election that we just had,

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:07.230
but back in 2008,

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:10.160
in that period when Hillary Clinton

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.890
and Barack Obama were
going to be competing

00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:17.350
for the Democratic
nomination to be President,

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:19.340
in the 2008 period,

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:24.340
and Citizens United is
a nonprofit corporation.

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:26.650
That is, they're not selling shoes.

00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:28.180
They're just using the corporate form

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:32.420
to be able to engage in
associational activity,

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:34.420
and there had already been a rule,

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:36.440
well before the Supreme
Court had established,

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:39.750
which said if you're an
ideological corporation,

00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:43.440
and you don't take money
from for-profit companies,

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:46.220
you can already spend
whatever money you have

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:50.570
in your treasury on political
ads and political activity,

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:54.340
but Citizens United
deliberately took money

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:56.630
from for-profit corporations,
and they did it because

00:07:56.630 --> 00:07:58.210
they were trying to set up a test case.

00:07:58.210 --> 00:08:00.450
What they wanted to do was
to take this documentary

00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:01.760
they had made, Hillary: The Movie,

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:04.390
which said very negative
things about Hillary Clinton,

00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:09.260
and they wanted to pay Comcast
Cable a million dollars

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:13.860
to make this movie available
as a video on demand,

00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:16.580
which anyone could watch
by choosing it from,

00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:18.120
you know, their cable guide.

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:19.730
They'd be able to watch it,

00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:22.060
and under the federal statute,

00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:24.610
the Federal Election
Commission said this looks like

00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:29.180
it's going to be on television,

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:31.770
broadcast in a period
close to the election,

00:08:31.770 --> 00:08:34.480
and it's going to feature
the name Hillary Clinton,

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:35.957
who's a candidate for President,

00:08:35.957 --> 00:08:38.400
and that would make it an election ad.

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:40.690
It cannot be paid for by corporate funds.

00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:42.880
There were lots of ways
that the Supreme Court

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:47.060
could have gone, aside from
overturning earlier cases,

00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:49.250
but the court was bold here,

00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:50.650
and on a five to four vote,

00:08:50.650 --> 00:08:53.260
the liberals on the court
against the conservatives,

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:56.080
the conservatives won, and the

00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:02.090
longstanding federal
prohibition on corporations

00:09:02.090 --> 00:09:04.580
and labor unions as well spending money

00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:07.090
in federal elections fell.

00:09:07.090 --> 00:09:10.010
- [Sal] So, just as kind
of a lay citizen, you know,

00:09:10.010 --> 00:09:12.560
on the face of it, I understand why

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:14.320
there's all of this
Congressional legislation.

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:18.150
You're afraid of undue
influence from corporations,

00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:21.360
but you know, we were able
to talk to a few experts who,

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:22.740
I think, took a more sympathetic view

00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:26.450
to the Supreme Court
ruling, and their point was

00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:29.560
Citizens United was this organization.

00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:31.570
It definitely had an
ideological point of view,

00:09:31.570 --> 00:09:34.530
and it was making this content

00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:36.700
that was clearly anti-Hillary Clinton,

00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:40.980
but there's many organizations,
media organizations,

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:42.930
you know, I think we could
point to news channels,

00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:45.130
websites, which most people would consider

00:09:45.130 --> 00:09:47.970
to be news organizations
or media organizations,

00:09:47.970 --> 00:09:51.600
that do definitely lean one way
or the other, left or right,

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:53.760
and they're arguing that the reason why

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:56.560
the Supreme Court had to rule this way is

00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:58.800
if what Citizens United wasn't allowed,

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:03.340
then whether you're talking
about an MSNBC or a FOX News,

00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:06.100
that that would start
putting them under scrutiny.

00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:09.980
- [Rick] Well, the law that
limited what corporations can do

00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:13.700
created an exemption
for press organizations

00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:16.870
that were engaged in
journalistic kinds of activities,

00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:19.343
and indeed, the majority
on the courts said

00:10:19.343 --> 00:10:21.010
we have to treat them the same.

00:10:21.010 --> 00:10:23.790
- [Bradley] The justices
expressed real concern about

00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:25.740
the nature of the government's argument.

00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:27.600
They said, you know, you're saying

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:30.390
you can limit broadcast ads,
but what about internet?

00:10:30.390 --> 00:10:32.640
Could you limit communications
about candidates

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:33.850
over the internet?

00:10:33.850 --> 00:10:38.230
And the government attorneys
eventually said yes, we can.

00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:43.230
We can limit anything that
involves a corporation

00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:46.440
speaking about a candidate for office,

00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:48.260
whether it's on the internet or whatever,

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:52.080
and by the time the
oral argument was over,

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:54.790
the government had asserted
that it would have the right,

00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:57.900
for example, to limit
the publication of a book

00:10:57.900 --> 00:10:59.920
that included one line of advocacy

00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:01.360
urging people to vote for a candidate

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:04.090
at the very end of a long,
you know, 500 page book.

00:11:04.090 --> 00:11:06.440
They had suggested that
they could prohibit a union

00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:08.370
from publishing a pamphlet that advocated

00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:10.030
the election of a candidate.

00:11:10.030 --> 00:11:11.788
You could envision, you know, a candidate,

00:11:11.788 --> 00:11:13.213
something like why working Americans

00:11:13.213 --> 00:11:15.540
should support, you know,
Hillary Clinton for President,

00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:16.950
or something like that.

00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:19.700
They had suggested that

00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:25.010
books over Kindle could be
banned under existing law,

00:11:25.010 --> 00:11:27.270
and so, the Supreme Court said alright,

00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:29.320
this is very problematic to us.

00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:31.930
They scheduled it for
a second oral argument,

00:11:31.930 --> 00:11:34.110
heard the case again, and
at the end of the case,

00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:36.090
said we don't think that this is right,

00:11:36.090 --> 00:11:37.240
at least a majority did,

00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:42.240
said you cannot limit the
speech of a group of people

00:11:42.603 --> 00:11:47.254
or a body simply because
it is incorporated.

00:11:47.254 --> 00:11:49.560
- [Rick] But there was an
argument of the dissenters

00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:51.300
that said the press is different.

00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:54.140
The press serves an educational
and informative function,

00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:57.410
which is different than the
function of other corporations,

00:11:57.410 --> 00:12:01.440
and it's permissible, maybe in
part because the Constitution

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:03.796
does provide separate
protection for the press.

00:12:03.796 --> 00:12:06.180
There was a big debate
about what that means,

00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:08.135
to carve this out.

00:12:08.135 --> 00:12:10.460
Now, that does create an inconsistency.

00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:12.600
We'd be saying we're
gonna treat Google one way

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:15.260
and FOX News and The
New York Times another,

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:17.180
but the current law is also inconsistent,

00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:19.260
so let me give you an
example from the other side,

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:20.880
which is think is very hard for those

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:23.560
who support Citizens United to answer.

00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:28.270
In a case that came a couple
of years after Citizens United,

00:12:28.270 --> 00:12:30.830
there was a guy who was
a Canadian law student,

00:12:30.830 --> 00:12:35.150
then he became a lawyer in New York.

00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:38.250
He went to Harvard Law
School, worked in New York,

00:12:38.250 --> 00:12:43.250
and he was here on a work
visa, and he wanted to,

00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:46.930
according to his complaint that he filed,

00:12:46.930 --> 00:12:51.260
he wanted to go to
Kinko's and make flyers,

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:52.940
spend 50 cents making flyers,

00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:55.830
saying re-elect President Obama,

00:12:55.830 --> 00:12:58.470
and he wanted to hand those
flyers out in Central Park.

00:12:58.470 --> 00:13:00.910
Well, because he was not a citizen,

00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:04.150
even though he's in the United
States and has other kinds

00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:05.960
of First Amendment rights,
even though he's not a citizen,

00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:06.970
he would violate federal law.

00:13:06.970 --> 00:13:10.100
He could go to jail for
years, face a $10,000 fine,

00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:12.050
if he hands that piece
of paper to one person,

00:13:12.050 --> 00:13:15.110
because then he'd be engaging
in election-related activity

00:13:15.110 --> 00:13:18.100
as a non-citizen, and this case went up

00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:20.990
and the Supreme Court had
a chance to explain why,

00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:24.070
as in Citizens United, if
the identity of the speaker

00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:25.770
doesn't matter in the
First Amendment, really,

00:13:25.770 --> 00:13:29.616
it's always about more speech
all the time in elections,

00:13:29.616 --> 00:13:32.790
why is it that this guy, Benjamin
Blumen, could be shut up?

00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:36.440
And the Supreme Court
didn't even hear the case.

00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:39.450
It came up on a special kind of appeal

00:13:39.450 --> 00:13:41.980
from a three-judge
court, which means that,

00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:43.470
when the court declined to hear the case,

00:13:43.470 --> 00:13:46.340
it agreed that the lower court was right,

00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:48.490
that this law is constitutional.

00:13:48.490 --> 00:13:50.570
So, we now have this new anomaly,

00:13:50.570 --> 00:13:54.510
which is that we say
that non-human entities,

00:13:54.510 --> 00:13:58.010
these corporations that
only exist because the state

00:13:58.010 --> 00:14:00.970
allows it to create this fake thing,

00:14:00.970 --> 00:14:03.760
non-human entities have
these First Amendment rights,

00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:07.130
but yet a human being who
was living in New York

00:14:07.130 --> 00:14:10.150
who wanted to spend 50
cents, he couldn't do that,

00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:11.496
and so, what's the difference,

00:14:11.496 --> 00:14:14.070
if it's really true that the identity

00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:15.840
of the speaker doesn't matter,

00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:18.240
which the Supreme Court
said to Citizens United?

00:14:19.378 --> 00:14:20.700
Well, certainly, the identity
of the speaker matters

00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:22.840
when that speaker is a foreign individual,

00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:25.940
or a foreign government,
or a foreign corporation.

00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:27.960
- [Sal] So, it seems like
the majority opinion,

00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:31.330
they're not saying that large corporations

00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:35.790
being able to funnel tens or
hundreds of millions of dollars

00:14:35.790 --> 00:14:39.095
for or against a campaign,
independently of the candidate,

00:14:39.095 --> 00:14:41.790
that that won't necessarily corrupt,

00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:44.060
but it's more of by trying to regulate it

00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:46.600
in the way that the
McCain-Feingold Act does,

00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:49.480
it actually has far-reaching consequences,

00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:51.730
or trying to regulate it in the way that

00:14:51.730 --> 00:14:53.610
the Federal Election Commission
was trying to regulate it

00:14:53.610 --> 00:14:56.610
with Citizens United, it has
far-reaching consequences

00:14:56.610 --> 00:14:58.810
that touch on just general
free speech issues,

00:14:58.810 --> 00:15:00.300
like what you just talked about, you know,

00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:03.040
a sentence in a book that
happens to be published or sold

00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:06.970
during the election, or a movie
made by a random filmmaker.

00:15:06.970 --> 00:15:08.990
- [Bradley] I think, for
one thing, for example,

00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:10.336
a lot of people, again,

00:15:10.336 --> 00:15:12.740
they resent to say that
corporations aren't people,

00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:14.610
but they don't realize
corporations have always,

00:15:14.610 --> 00:15:17.750
again, had some of these
rights, acted as corporations,

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:21.300
and acted in the political
arena in a variety of ways,

00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:23.390
and I think that what these
people should ask themselves is,

00:15:23.390 --> 00:15:26.740
well, if Exxon were not incorporated,

00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:29.480
would they go oh, well,
Exxon's not incorporated.

00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:30.313
Well, that's fine,

00:15:30.313 --> 00:15:32.320
let them spend all the
money they want, right?

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:34.820
And conversely, I find
most of these people,

00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:37.594
if you say, well, should
we be able to censor

00:15:37.594 --> 00:15:38.830
The New York Times?

00:15:38.830 --> 00:15:39.980
It's a corporation?

00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:42.020
They say well, no, no, no, not that,

00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:45.140
and when you see that, I
think it makes people realize

00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:46.620
the question is not really whether

00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:49.240
it's a corporation speaking or not.

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:52.550
The question is whether or not we think

00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:56.650
the First Amendment protects
the expenditure of money.

00:15:56.650 --> 00:15:58.470
- [Rick] We actually had to have rules

00:15:58.470 --> 00:16:01.000
before Citizens United to differentiate,

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.010
because, actually, this was the law, that

00:16:05.010 --> 00:16:07.570
Google and General Motors
could not spend their funds

00:16:07.570 --> 00:16:09.210
directly on election speech,

00:16:09.210 --> 00:16:12.600
but The New York Times and FOX News could,

00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:13.900
and so we had tests,

00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:16.904
and the Federal Election
Commission had tests,

00:16:16.904 --> 00:16:18.470
and there are just some
disagreements about

00:16:18.470 --> 00:16:19.620
how to best do it.

00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:23.110
I would point to the work
of Professor Sonja West

00:16:23.110 --> 00:16:25.400
at the University of Georgia,

00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:26.650
who has written extensively on this,

00:16:26.650 --> 00:16:28.710
and she said the test should be people

00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:31.100
who are regularly engaged in journalism.

00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:33.080
That doesn't mean it has to be objective

00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:34.400
and you can't have a point of view.

00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:36.850
It doesn't mean there's a
problem with FOX News or MSNBC,

00:16:36.850 --> 00:16:38.970
because they might have a point of view,

00:16:38.970 --> 00:16:40.620
but it means you're doing something

00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:42.540
other than electioneering.

00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:45.088
- [Bradley] I do think that,
yes, that's what I'm saying,

00:16:45.088 --> 00:16:48.280
that these are some of the
costs of having a vibrant,

00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:49.830
robust First Amendment,

00:16:49.830 --> 00:16:52.670
and if you want to give
the government the power

00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:55.050
to regulate, you know, books to movies,

00:16:55.050 --> 00:16:58.110
you should think about who's
the politician you most hate?

00:16:58.110 --> 00:16:59.290
Is it Hillary Clinton?

00:16:59.290 --> 00:17:00.480
Is it Donald Trump?

00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:02.150
Is it somebody else?

00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:04.880
Do you want them in charge of deciding

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:07.450
who gets to speak out in
politics and in what way

00:17:07.450 --> 00:17:10.038
and in what fashion and what manner?

00:17:10.038 --> 00:17:12.930
And I think you should think
about it in those terms,

00:17:12.930 --> 00:17:15.360
and that sometimes makes people realize

00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:19.710
maybe it's best to let things go.

00:17:19.710 --> 00:17:22.040
Now, I would say,
however, having said that,

00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:24.320
that a lot of the arguments
about corporate influence

00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:26.560
are vastly overblown.

00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:28.560
There's quite a bit of debate, really,

00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:30.310
about whether or not
corporations, in fact,

00:17:30.310 --> 00:17:34.607
benefit from spending money on politics.

00:17:34.607 --> 00:17:37.970
Big corporations, you know,
the Fortune 500 types,

00:17:37.970 --> 00:17:40.600
what they really like to do
is spend money on lobbying.

00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:42.520
That's much more direct.

00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:44.450
They can talk to candidates directly.

00:17:44.450 --> 00:17:45.700
They can let other people elect folks.

00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:47.350
There's almost certain
to be some folks elected

00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:49.700
who they will like and they
can go work with those people

00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:51.930
and craft messages and bills,

00:17:51.930 --> 00:17:53.510
and they can do this
more behind the scenes,

00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:55.512
and that way, they don't have to offend

00:17:55.512 --> 00:17:56.770
any of their customers who don't like

00:17:56.770 --> 00:17:58.470
the party that they're supporting,

00:17:58.470 --> 00:18:00.680
but it's also clear
that just spending money

00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:02.558
doesn't automatically win the elections.

00:18:02.558 --> 00:18:04.560
You can look at the last
presidential election.

00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:06.450
I mean, Donald Trump spent, all totaled,

00:18:06.450 --> 00:18:09.360
about a quarter of what the
Hillary Clinton forces spent.

00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:10.690
It certainly helps to have money,

00:18:10.690 --> 00:18:13.960
but in the end, it's not dispositive.

00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:17.770
What the money does is it's
spent to try to inform voters,

00:18:17.770 --> 00:18:20.710
and those voters go out
and vote at the polls.

00:18:20.710 --> 00:18:22.880
- [Sal] So we've learned
that, in Citizens United,

00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:25.070
the Supreme Court ruled
that political spending

00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:28.430
by corporations,
associations, and labor unions

00:18:28.430 --> 00:18:32.880
is a form of protected speech
under the First Amendment,

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:36.790
but whether or how the
government can limit free speech

00:18:36.790 --> 00:18:40.480
in campaign contributions
is still a matter of debate.

00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:43.640
As Rick Hasen notes, one
test for the difference

00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:46.560
between the free speech
rights accorded to journalists

00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:50.410
and those or corporations might
be whether they are entities

00:18:50.410 --> 00:18:52.690
regularly engaged in journalism,

00:18:52.690 --> 00:18:54.600
but as Bradley Smith points out,

00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:56.720
allowing the government to impose limits

00:18:56.720 --> 00:19:00.000
on how people or corporations
speak out in politics

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.990
may lead to unintended consequences.

00:19:02.990 --> 00:19:05.450
