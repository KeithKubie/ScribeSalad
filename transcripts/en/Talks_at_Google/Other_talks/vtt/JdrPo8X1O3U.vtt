00:00:01.769 --> 00:00:03.310
JOSEPH SMARR: My
name's Joseph Smarr.

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:05.730
I'm an engineer on the
Google Photos team.

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:07.930
And I'm delighted to have
Atul Singh here with us

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:11.730
to-- I can't resist saying a
little bit about his biography,

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.820
because I think-- you
know that Dos Equis

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.125
commercial for the most
interesting man in the world?

00:00:17.125 --> 00:00:19.250
Still, it's like a slightly
dated reference by now.

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:21.989
But I think Atul might
be my candidate vote

00:00:21.989 --> 00:00:23.530
if I had to vote
for a real life most

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:24.800
interesting man in the world.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.520
And maybe you'll
see why in a second.

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.790
So he was born in Goa,
India, and quickly became

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:33.830
somewhat infamous, I would
say, because as a teenager,

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:36.180
he became very active in
protesting what he saw

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.382
as the political corruption
in the Indian royal families,

00:00:39.382 --> 00:00:40.840
and Indian government
and so forth,

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.810
and developed
quite a reputation.

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:45.730
He then went on to become an
officer in the Indian military,

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.410
and was in combat in Kashmir and
in several other active combat

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.950
zones against Islamic
fundamentalists and so forth.

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:53.940
Luckily, he seems
to have survived.

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.600
He then became a deep scholar.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.350
He has advanced degrees from
Oxford, and the Wharton School,

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.308
and other places,
and was for a while

00:01:02.308 --> 00:01:04.599
a corporate lawyer at one of
the most prestigious firms

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:07.520
in London, representing Goldman
Sachs and the London Olympics

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:08.810
and other sorts of places.

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.070
But in 2010, he decided
to abandon all of that

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.140
and start "Fair Observer,"
which is a sort of news magazine

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.440
journalism outfit.

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.950
It's a nonprofit with
a very global focus.

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.990
And for me, it's something
where I've learned more

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.122
and felt like I've gotten a sort
of more deep and unbiased look

00:01:26.122 --> 00:01:27.580
at what's going on
around the world

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.871
and a more integrated, global
approach to understanding

00:01:29.871 --> 00:01:32.350
the news than almost any other
publication I can think of.

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:34.100
And I think that's
largely thanks to Atul.

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.350
And he's actually
recruited sort of a network

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.010
of journalists across
the world to help

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:39.590
contribute to "Fair Observer."

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:41.540
And he also writes for
it himself, of course.

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.684
And beyond that, you can
go to fairobserver.com

00:01:43.684 --> 00:01:44.850
if you want to check it out.

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.350
I would encourage
you to do that.

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.485
He's also written for
"Huffington Post" and "Al

00:01:48.485 --> 00:01:51.000
Jazeera," and other
places like that.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.270
And in addition to that, he
teaches political economy

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.690
at both Berkeley and at the
IIT, and travels back and forth.

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:01.030
He's a poet.

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.480
He was a former
Himalayan mountaineer.

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:06.170
He's written an
award-winning play.

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.670
He speaks--

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:07.329
ATUL SINGH: Not quite.

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:07.808
[LAUGHING]

00:02:07.808 --> 00:02:09.910
JOSEPH SMARR: He speaks six
or seven different languages

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:10.868
from what I understand.

00:02:10.868 --> 00:02:13.776
And anyway, the point being,
I think you get the idea.

00:02:13.776 --> 00:02:15.400
It's a pretty unique
set of background,

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.230
and I think makes him-- oh,
sorry-- I think uniquely

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.370
qualified to speak to--
there's a set of things going

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.270
around the world right
now, obviously, that

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.410
have us all kind of
confused and worried.

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.520
And Atul's sort of integrative
approach to both understanding

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.020
the history and
context of what's

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:33.140
going on in each
of these countries,

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.380
and also an ability to sort
of synthesize it together,

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:36.880
I think, is what
makes me so excited

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.050
for him to come and talk
to us about the global rise

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.650
of the far right.

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.130
So with that,
please, take it away.

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.796
Thank you, Atul.

00:02:41.796 --> 00:02:43.895
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.564
ATUL SINGH: Thank you,
Joseph, for your kind words.

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.950
It's a real pleasure
and a privilege

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:56.120
and an honor to be here.

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.080
Thank you so much
for coming over.

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.830
Thank you, Joseph,
for hosting me.

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.910
I have to thank my
team, first of all.

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:07.990
And they are folks
who have worked

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:10.980
with me, trudged the lows.

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.510
And we are hoping for the highs.

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:19.080
We have a managing editor who's
written the book, "The Arab

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.725
Uprisings," and
he speaks Arabic.

00:03:20.725 --> 00:03:23.550
And we have a Deputy Managing
Editor who's Russian,

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:25.680
and her name is
Anna Pivovarchuk.

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:31.590
So imagine an Arab, a Russian,
and an Indian heading a ship.

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.180
And somehow, it manages to work.

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.670
And that's "Fair Observer."

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.680
And we have 1,600 plus writers.

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.720
We're nearing to 1,700 writers
now from over 40 countries.

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.090
And the premise is very simple.

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:46.390
The premise is if I
speak, and I give you

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:49.240
a point of view, that's
one point of view informed

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:52.760
by my experience, my
cultural background,

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.950
my philosophical beliefs, and
my historical understanding.

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:01.020
But if, let's say, I put
forth my point of view,

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:04.930
and Joseph did, and Shael did,
who's sitting in the first row,

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:09.020
and Alexander did, who's sitting
in the back with a Sydney

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:14.070
t-shirt, and so
did others, then we

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:19.209
would get a better to a better
understanding of the world,

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:21.399
because each of us
has blind sites.

00:04:21.399 --> 00:04:25.830
And when we share ideas,
and we share our thoughts,

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:29.970
and we somehow think
through things together,

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:32.640
cutting across borders,
backgrounds, and beliefs,

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.670
we get a better
approximation of the truth.

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:39.000
So, so much so for the
fundamental philosophical idea

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.570
behind "Fair Observer."

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:44.130
I am told I should tell
everyone these days

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:46.170
to like us on social media.

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:47.660
I always forget that.

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:50.930
So now, since I'm at Google,
I'm telling you all to like us

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:54.820
on Google+, of course,
first, followed by Facebook

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:58.380
and Twitter, and sign
up for our newsletter.

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:00.380
So now that I've done
the mandatory pitch

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:02.650
that my team would
be proud of, let's

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:07.490
get cracking into a
rather somber issue.

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:09.720
And the somber issue
is, very frankly,

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:12.030
the global rise
of the far right.

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:14.420
Now before we carry
on into examining

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:17.630
what is the far right, let's
understand what is the right.

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:20.240
And I have a very advanced
piece of technology

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:21.890
in Google that helps me.

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:22.780
It is this.

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:26.130
It was invented a while
ago, apparently in China.

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:30.300
And there's another thing called
this, which is pencil, right?

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:34.070
And I tend to write my things
like this, as you can see.

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:37.910
I have really adapted
to the 21st century.

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:42.820
But if you look at the
origins of the word the right,

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:46.310
it goes back to that wonderful
event, or not so wonderful

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:48.200
event, depending on your
point of view, which

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:50.480
was the French Revolution.

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:53.220
And after the French
Revolution, those

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:56.440
who supported l'ancien
regime, the old regime,

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:58.870
sat on the right.

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:00.300
[FRENCH]

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:03.610
And those who basically wanted
revolution, and some of them

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:07.610
wanted heads to roll, and heads
did roll, sat on the left,

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:09.410
[FRENCH].

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:15.290
And those on the right believed
in hierarchy, tradition,

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:18.930
clericalism, which is you
should go to mass every Sunday.

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:21.150
I doubt very many Googlers do.

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:24.060
You're all sinners, right?

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:24.650
Or not all.

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:28.230
Some of you are not sinners.

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:36.420
But anyway, the people
who sat on the right

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:40.110
also believed that inequality
and social stratification

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:43.700
were the natural order
of the universe, which

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:46.020
as George Orwell
put memorably, "some

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:47.790
are more equal than others."

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:52.140
So those who are clever and who
are engineers work at Google,

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:55.010
and those who have no skills
except rudimentary pencil

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:59.080
skills live like our
artists in a garret.

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:02.050
That's the natural
stratification of the universe.

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:05.070
And I'm just a
modern manifestation.

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:07.680
And of course, those who
do other menial jobs are

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:11.500
further down in the pecking
order of the universe and get

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:12.860
paid accordingly.

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:19.820
Now, that premise that
inequality is important changes

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:21.220
for the right over time.

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:23.430
Instead of becoming
something by birth,

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:28.560
it becomes something
by ability and effort.

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:32.910
Now, what is that fundamental
belief on the right?

00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:34.210
It is very simple.

00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:38.660
If you give everyone the same
outcome, no one will work.

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:40.240
And it won't be fair.

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:42.770
So if Joseph works
100 hour weeks,

00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:45.840
he deserves a fine
villa by the sea.

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:49.120
And if, let's say,
Shael is lazy,

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:51.800
he deserves to be
homeless and bum around.

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:54.160
And maybe if Joseph
is feeling charitable,

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:58.100
he can give Shael a piece of
bread, and maybe some gruel.

00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:00.480
And then, Shael
can be Oliver Twist

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:02.820
and say, "Please, sir,
can I have some more?"

00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:06.390
But the premise of the
right is very simple.

00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:14.930
It's that the competitive
free market is largely just,

00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:18.170
because people should
get what they deserve.

00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:21.210
The just desserts.

00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:25.970
Not desserts as in ice
cream, but just desserts.

00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:29.840
And the competitive free market,
according to this belief,

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:31.450
is free.

00:08:31.450 --> 00:08:35.390
It is largely fair, and
it rewards ingenuity

00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:38.330
and industriousness.

00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:42.510
So if you're innovative,
you come up with a new idea,

00:08:42.510 --> 00:08:48.460
and you somehow make that idea
popular by working very hard,

00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:52.960
you deserve greater rewards
than those who don't.

00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:59.210
And in this premise-- sorry,
in this belief system,

00:08:59.210 --> 00:09:02.650
is another premise that
markets achieve better outcomes

00:09:02.650 --> 00:09:05.210
than governments, because
governments are top-down.

00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:06.720
Governments are authoritarian.

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:10.030
Governments don't have
those price signals.

00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:16.191
So trusting markets is more
efficient than trusting

00:09:16.191 --> 00:09:16.690
governments.

00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:19.450
And that brings us
to something else,

00:09:19.450 --> 00:09:23.080
which I call the equity
efficiency paradox,

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:26.050
or if equity
efficiency paradigm.

00:09:26.050 --> 00:09:30.680
And that is in the era of
the modern left-- modern,

00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:37.830
I would say, post-Second
World War-- and right

00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:40.370
is the fundamental
defining feature

00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:42.350
for two sides of the
political divide.

00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:45.916
If you are the
Labor Party in 1945,

00:09:45.916 --> 00:09:47.290
and you've just
won the election,

00:09:47.290 --> 00:09:50.360
you believe in a
National Health Service,

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:53.240
because you believe that
the inefficiency that

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:56.620
will be inherent in the
National Health Service maybe

00:09:56.620 --> 00:09:58.500
the drop in
innovation that might

00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:03.930
happen because of a bureaucracy,
is worth it for greater equity.

00:10:03.930 --> 00:10:07.160
Everyone deserves
health care as a right.

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:10.170
That is a premise that
the left all across Europe

00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:11.910
operates from.

00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:15.470
Everyone deserves
schooling as a right.

00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:18.980
Everyone deserves certain
inalienable rights

00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:24.870
that are more than just liberty
of expression and belief.

00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:28.270
Now if you're on
the right, you say,

00:10:28.270 --> 00:10:32.100
the equity efficiency paradigm
is getting a little too

00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:33.830
unbalanced.

00:10:33.830 --> 00:10:36.220
Because what we
believe is in freedom,

00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:38.390
and freedom includes
the freedom to fail,

00:10:38.390 --> 00:10:41.190
and freedom includes,
at its most extreme,

00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:42.280
the freedom to die.

00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:45.200
You just didn't make it in
the evolutionary struggle.

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:48.880
It's a Darwinian view.

00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:52.260
But there is something to
be said for both sides.

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:55.110
Because when societies
tip over to the extreme,

00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:59.450
far to the extreme of any
side, they sort of meander

00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:03.570
and lose something intangible.

00:11:03.570 --> 00:11:05.570
It's that critical balance.

00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:09.400
And that critical balance is
different for every society.

00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:12.460
Now, so much so for
this distinction

00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:13.900
between left and right.

00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:18.020
Let us understand
what is the far right.

00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:22.520
Now the far right takes ideas
of inequality and stratification

00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:24.990
to absurd levels.

00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:29.420
It bases them not just on
birth, which is basically

00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:32.750
class and heredity, not
just on outcomes, which

00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:34.390
is belief in the free market.

00:11:34.390 --> 00:11:40.370
It bases them on these ideas
of nation, race, ethnicity,

00:11:40.370 --> 00:11:41.880
or even religion.

00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:46.620
So the classic example
is Nazi Germany.

00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:48.240
And Nazi Germany,
lest we forget,

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:52.620
was the National Socialist
German Workers' Party.

00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:55.780
There was the word
socialist in it.

00:11:55.780 --> 00:11:56.860
Most people forget that.

00:11:56.860 --> 00:11:59.860
Most people think they were
just this far right group, which

00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:02.260
wanted complete
unfettered freedom,

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:05.610
and that included freedom to
kill the gypsies and the Jews.

00:12:05.610 --> 00:12:08.290
But it was a little
more complex than that.

00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:12.940
And that brings me
to a second point.

00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:14.580
The first one that
I made was the far

00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:17.905
right is predicated on nation,
race, ethnicity, religion, et

00:12:17.905 --> 00:12:19.280
cetera.

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:21.920
The second one is
that the far right

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:24.650
tends to be a strange
amalgamation of the right

00:12:24.650 --> 00:12:29.130
and left, which is
often forgotten.

00:12:29.130 --> 00:12:33.150
In terms of identity,
it draws upon the right.

00:12:33.150 --> 00:12:35.110
It draws upon
something primeval.

00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:38.830
It draws upon this idea that
the German people, [GERMAN],

00:12:38.830 --> 00:12:40.240
we are one people.

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:41.590
We are somehow special.

00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:43.241
We are superior.

00:12:43.241 --> 00:12:45.040
All right.

00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:48.560
But the economics,
now that everyone

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:52.210
is special, now that
everyone is superior,

00:12:52.210 --> 00:12:55.540
then suddenly turn left wing,
because if everyone belonging

00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:59.910
to a certain race is superior,
then no one should be starving.

00:12:59.910 --> 00:13:03.220
So you have Hitler Youth.

00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:06.220
You pack off all the
nice, blonde, tall people

00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:09.010
to exercise and spend
time in the countryside,

00:13:09.010 --> 00:13:10.550
and the Untermenschen
conveniently

00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:11.725
to concentration camps.

00:13:14.420 --> 00:13:18.560
But if you are from
the superior race,

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:20.330
then you function
collectively together.

00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:25.370
So well, the
Autobahn gets built.

00:13:25.370 --> 00:13:28.140
You have Keynesian policies.

00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:33.480
In fact, Nazi Germany has, if
you look at it objectively,

00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:36.610
has more Keynesian
policies than either the UK

00:13:36.610 --> 00:13:39.720
at that time or the US.

00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:42.790
Franklin Delano Roosevelt's
economic policies

00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:47.410
and Adolf Hitler's
economic policies

00:13:47.410 --> 00:13:51.040
are strikingly similar.

00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:54.880
Huge investment in public
infrastructure for a start.

00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:57.270
Greater focus on equity.

00:13:57.270 --> 00:14:02.880
So as I said, the
identity for the far right

00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:07.610
comes from the right, and the
economics of the far right

00:14:07.610 --> 00:14:09.350
comes from the left.

00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:12.470
It becomes a strange beast.

00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:19.160
And the Marxist view of
Nazis is equally flawed

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:22.790
as Friedrich von Hayek's
views of the Nazis.

00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:26.490
Now Marxists view it as
the extreme corruption

00:14:26.490 --> 00:14:28.260
of a free market system.

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:33.440
And they blame the rise of Nazi
Germany on the capitalist model

00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:35.000
of government.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:39.050
Friedrich von Hayek, who taught
at the University of Chicago--

00:14:39.050 --> 00:14:42.280
and mind you, he
was a Viennese Jew.

00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:48.510
He had fled the
Vienna that had been

00:14:48.510 --> 00:14:52.460
the center of the great Jewish
intellectual Renaissance

00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:55.750
just as the far right
started rising to London,

00:14:55.750 --> 00:14:57.750
and he taught at the
London School of Economics,

00:14:57.750 --> 00:15:00.900
and then made his
way to the US, where

00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:04.030
his ideas were popularized
in the "Reader's Digest"

00:15:04.030 --> 00:15:06.920
simplification of his work,
"The Road to Serfdom."

00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:11.120
And he used to shudder like good
Austrian aristocrats often did,

00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:14.490
as did Freud, actually,
at the simplification

00:15:14.490 --> 00:15:19.640
of his ideas in this wonderful,
grand, and glorious land.

00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:21.860
But fundamentally,
Friedrich von Hayek

00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:25.980
says that, well, what you're
seeing in the Nazi party

00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:29.600
is the accretion of
powers of the state.

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:31.550
And once the state
becomes too powerful,

00:15:31.550 --> 00:15:32.980
the individual loses liberty.

00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:35.090
And once the individual
loses liberty,

00:15:35.090 --> 00:15:38.270
he becomes a serf, because a
bureaucrat, a petty bureaucrat,

00:15:38.270 --> 00:15:41.700
tells him what to
do, or her to do,

00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:44.380
and everything goes belly up.

00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:47.360
Peter Thiel would be delighted.

00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:51.020
As we know, he's very delighted
with Donald Trump these days.

00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:53.480
He is a cheerleader
for Donald Trump,

00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:56.056
except that he doesn't
have very long legs,

00:15:56.056 --> 00:15:57.430
and he doesn't
wear short skirts.

00:15:57.430 --> 00:15:59.650
Mercifully so, thankfully.

00:15:59.650 --> 00:16:00.622
Anyway.

00:16:00.622 --> 00:16:05.950
[LAUGHING] So why are we
talking about the rise

00:16:05.950 --> 00:16:08.600
of the far right?

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:11.170
The rise of the far right
is important because

00:16:11.170 --> 00:16:12.380
of certain developments.

00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:15.000
And I'm not going to go
through every country.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.330
But I'm going to take
certain European examples,

00:16:17.330 --> 00:16:20.900
because Europe has a
history with the far right,

00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:22.980
and the European
nation states, which

00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:26.520
was born in 1648 at the
end of the 30 Years' War,

00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:28.710
is the model
everyone else adopts

00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:31.880
with varying degrees
of success and failure,

00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:34.640
whether it's Africa,
Latin America, or Asia.

00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:37.050
And arguably, you can say
that in the Middle East,

00:16:37.050 --> 00:16:39.070
the failure of the
Westphalian model as

00:16:39.070 --> 00:16:42.060
demonstrated by the rise
of the Islamic State,

00:16:42.060 --> 00:16:46.120
and the reversion to
the Shiite Sunni schism,

00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:50.710
overlaid with tribal
rivalries, overlaid

00:16:50.710 --> 00:16:54.410
with regional rivalries,
overlaid with superpower

00:16:54.410 --> 00:16:57.530
meddling, has led to their
version of the 30 Years' War.

00:16:57.530 --> 00:16:59.280
Now, you may not believe that.

00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:01.320
You may have a
different argument.

00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:04.619
But what is certainly true is
that the nation state of Iraq

00:17:04.619 --> 00:17:09.200
created through a stroke of the
pen in the post-colonial era,

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:12.450
and the nation state of Syria,
and many other such entities

00:17:12.450 --> 00:17:16.960
are actually de
facto nonexistent.

00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:19.170
But let's revert to Europe.

00:17:19.170 --> 00:17:22.990
And let's look at, let's
say, five examples--

00:17:22.990 --> 00:17:27.780
two at the fringes of Europe,
three at the heart of Europe.

00:17:27.780 --> 00:17:29.820
The first example is
Austria, obviously,

00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:31.700
because Hitler was Austrian.

00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:33.717
People forget that.

00:17:33.717 --> 00:17:35.300
We have someone with
an Austrian wife,

00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:38.690
and we have someone
who is part Austrian.

00:17:38.690 --> 00:17:45.600
And we have the rise of
someone called Norbert Hofer.

00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:46.940
Am I getting it right?

00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:47.970
More or less.

00:17:47.970 --> 00:17:48.830
OK.

00:17:48.830 --> 00:17:50.800
My apologies to
all the Austrians

00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:53.440
for my terrible pronunciation.

00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:57.160
But this chap carries a
Glock 9-millimeter pistol.

00:17:57.160 --> 00:18:00.436
This chap is a 45-year-old
aeronautical engineer.

00:18:00.436 --> 00:18:02.060
Now, you know, I am
one of those people

00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:03.490
who failed to get into IIT.

00:18:03.490 --> 00:18:10.610
My rambling brief biography
doesn't demonstrate the fact

00:18:10.610 --> 00:18:13.760
that I've actually been
muddled, and confused,

00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:17.110
and tried a few things, and
failed at more than one thing.

00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:18.620
But I didn't get into IIT.

00:18:18.620 --> 00:18:21.190
It makes me feel quite
good about myself

00:18:21.190 --> 00:18:24.694
when I see 45-year-old
aeronautical engineers who

00:18:24.694 --> 00:18:26.110
had the freedom
[INAUDIBLE], which

00:18:26.110 --> 00:18:32.120
has everything to do with a
lot of things except freedom.

00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:36.110
Now, he is against immigration.

00:18:36.110 --> 00:18:37.230
He has four children.

00:18:37.230 --> 00:18:40.460
He's the picture
of family values.

00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:42.740
He wears the blue
cornflower which

00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:48.790
is a clandestine Nazi symbol,
and believes in pan-Germanism,

00:18:48.790 --> 00:18:50.430
and all that.

00:18:50.430 --> 00:18:52.910
And the interesting thing
is he keeps pointing out

00:18:52.910 --> 00:18:58.150
that Austria is no longer
safe, because in 2015, 90,000

00:18:58.150 --> 00:19:01.740
migrants slash refugees were
let into that tiny country,

00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:04.350
and they are rupturing
the social contract.

00:19:04.350 --> 00:19:07.300
That sounds familiar?

00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:08.640
Right?

00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:11.920
Now, just before you
think Austria is unique,

00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:13.720
take a look at France.

00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:16.320
Marine Le Pen of the
National Front, and of course

00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:19.300
her lovely niece, her
highly attractive niece,

00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:22.960
Marion Marechal-Le
Pen, who doesn't quite

00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:26.080
have a similarly
attractive personality.

00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:31.520
But as a French [FRENCH], she
is delightful and delectable

00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:33.660
to look at.

00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:37.290
But more importantly,
the views of these ladies

00:19:37.290 --> 00:19:40.520
are disconcerting
and disturbing.

00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:42.730
And what is even
more disconcerting

00:19:42.730 --> 00:19:46.590
is in December in a regional
vote, they got 28% of the vote.

00:19:46.590 --> 00:19:50.480
That is nearly a third.

00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:53.920
That is just a few
votes off what the Nazis

00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:56.070
got when they won power.

00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:58.970
People forget the Nazis barely
got a third of the vote.

00:19:58.970 --> 00:20:03.630
They didn't ever get a
majority of the German vote.

00:20:03.630 --> 00:20:10.560
Now, her ideas have been derived
from her father, Jean-Marie.

00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:14.500
And Jean-Marie once
said Nazi gas chambers

00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:17.990
were a mere detail of history.

00:20:17.990 --> 00:20:22.600
So you're sort of
getting the idea of where

00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:26.060
the party is coming from, but
Marine has been very clever.

00:20:26.060 --> 00:20:30.520
Instead of focusing
on Jews as a problem,

00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:33.660
she reels against
Islamification, globalization,

00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:36.940
the EU, and the euro.

00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:42.910
It is an appeal to [FRENCH],
the grand nation of France,

00:20:42.910 --> 00:20:46.300
and the ethnic purity of France.

00:20:46.300 --> 00:20:47.760
And she's a complex character.

00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:50.880
But she's the new face
of the French far right.

00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:53.179
She succeeded her
father, and made

00:20:53.179 --> 00:20:54.470
the party far more respectable.

00:20:57.560 --> 00:20:59.700
Now let's look at Hungary.

00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:01.360
Well, I won't go
too much into it,

00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:04.910
but suffice to say Hungary
has a rising far right, which

00:21:04.910 --> 00:21:06.200
is dangerous.

00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:09.100
And Hungary was once a part of
the Austro-Hungarian empire.

00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:11.100
And Hungarians have
a very strong sense

00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:14.110
of ethnicity and ethnic pride.

00:21:14.110 --> 00:21:17.200
For those of you who've
spent time there,

00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:19.050
you realize the enormous pride.

00:21:19.050 --> 00:21:21.150
But that is now
manifesting itself

00:21:21.150 --> 00:21:24.250
in slightly disturbing ways.

00:21:24.250 --> 00:21:25.860
The last two examples.

00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:28.570
The fourth example is Turkey.

00:21:28.570 --> 00:21:33.740
And everyone's heard of
Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:36.330
And we know what is
happening in Turkey--

00:21:36.330 --> 00:21:40.020
the purge, the targeting
of both the Kurds

00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:42.500
and the Islamic State.

00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:47.590
But at the same time,
Erdogan is Islamist himself.

00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:49.670
He's also targeting
the Gulen Movement.

00:21:49.670 --> 00:21:53.050
And so it's a very
messy place, but he's

00:21:53.050 --> 00:21:58.440
appealing to an ethnic,
religious sense of grandiosity,

00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:03.180
and he's building symbols,
he's concentrating power.

00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:06.810
He's doing a lot of things which
far right leaders tend to do.

00:22:06.810 --> 00:22:10.720
Although so far he's never been
considered really far right.

00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:12.980
And of course,
the fifth example,

00:22:12.980 --> 00:22:19.690
how could I leave them
out, the fifth example

00:22:19.690 --> 00:22:21.380
is the wonderful Russians.

00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:23.440
Let's look at Russia.

00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:28.450
Vladimir Putin rode
to power on a platform

00:22:28.450 --> 00:22:31.840
of ethnic nationalism,
by crushing the revolt

00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:33.542
in Chechnya.

00:22:33.542 --> 00:22:37.430
And over time, the
sense of Russian pride

00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:40.660
has been strengthened,
the sense of projecting

00:22:40.660 --> 00:22:46.500
power has strengthened, and the
decaying Russian empire, which

00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:50.400
morphed into the Soviet
Union, and even when

00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:53.800
the Soviet Union collapsed, the
decaying Russian empire never

00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:58.340
entirely did, because you
had Ukraine that continued

00:22:58.340 --> 00:22:59.830
to be in a sphere of influence.

00:22:59.830 --> 00:23:06.110
You had other minorities
in Chechnya, Dagestan,

00:23:06.110 --> 00:23:07.790
et cetera, the Caucasus.

00:23:07.790 --> 00:23:14.590
And control was retained
through an iron hand.

00:23:14.590 --> 00:23:17.220
There wasn't even
the velvet glove.

00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:21.560
The iron fist it was bare
naked, and pretty bloody.

00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:24.260
If you look at Kadyrov,
his henchman in Chechnya,

00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:29.990
he has a reputation of
blow torching people alive.

00:23:29.990 --> 00:23:36.680
So that's a very interesting
look at the far right

00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:37.736
across Europe.

00:23:41.130 --> 00:23:45.050
Those of you who are Americans,
and those of you who not,

00:23:45.050 --> 00:23:49.140
who are just living here,
but paying taxes here,

00:23:49.140 --> 00:23:54.610
now are seeing the spectacle
of the rise of Donald Trump.

00:23:54.610 --> 00:24:00.170
And Donald Trump, in
more ways than one,

00:24:00.170 --> 00:24:05.970
reflects many of the
tendencies and characteristics

00:24:05.970 --> 00:24:07.580
of far right leaders.

00:24:07.580 --> 00:24:09.820
His economics, they
tend to be more

00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:12.340
to the left--
protectionism, talks

00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:14.900
about putting Americans first.

00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:17.710
But his identity--
Muslims are bad.

00:24:17.710 --> 00:24:21.660
They should not be
allowed to come in.

00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:25.932
Mexicans, we need a wall, and
Mexico is going to pay for it.

00:24:25.932 --> 00:24:27.265
And the wall's going to be huge.

00:24:30.330 --> 00:24:34.070
But all of which is
code, in many ways,

00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:37.800
to a certain idyllic past.

00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:41.890
And he is appealing to
certain ideas that have always

00:24:41.890 --> 00:24:44.670
been there, in some
ways, arguably,

00:24:44.670 --> 00:24:46.640
they were made respectable
by Ronald Reagan

00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:49.120
when he kicked off his
campaign in Neshoba,

00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:51.280
and talked about states' rights.

00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:54.380
Now, that's where "Mississippi
Burning" was based on.

00:24:54.380 --> 00:25:00.090
That's where three Jewish
anti-segregation kids

00:25:00.090 --> 00:25:01.762
were simply murdered.

00:25:01.762 --> 00:25:04.220
And so when he went and talked
about state's rights there--

00:25:04.220 --> 00:25:06.810
and you can hear that
speech on YouTube--

00:25:06.810 --> 00:25:11.660
it's code for you can
have segregation again.

00:25:11.660 --> 00:25:14.420
And of course, he
supported apartheid abroad.

00:25:14.420 --> 00:25:16.720
But what Trump is
doing is taking it

00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:20.790
from code, from dog
whistle standards,

00:25:20.790 --> 00:25:29.050
to absolute overt, naked, crude,
rude, brutish intolerance, as

00:25:29.050 --> 00:25:35.540
well as an appeal based
on ethnicity, based

00:25:35.540 --> 00:25:39.200
on a certain idea
of America that

00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:42.600
runs contrary to certain other
aspects and ideals of America,

00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:45.420
and one would argue the more
dominant aspects of America.

00:25:45.420 --> 00:25:48.070
When I look around
this room, and I

00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:53.110
look at the various ethnicities,
at the various nationalities,

00:25:53.110 --> 00:25:56.140
at the diversity
that you see here,

00:25:56.140 --> 00:25:57.620
this could not happen in India.

00:26:00.130 --> 00:26:05.340
This is what makes the US
special, the fact that you have

00:26:05.340 --> 00:26:10.870
some sort of a melting pot,
which cuts across, shall

00:26:10.870 --> 00:26:14.960
we say, ethnicity, that
cuts across religion,

00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:19.190
that cuts across many
of the other ties that

00:26:19.190 --> 00:26:21.220
define other countries.

00:26:21.220 --> 00:26:23.550
But yet America has
also had an underbelly.

00:26:23.550 --> 00:26:25.560
Because whilst it has
been an immigrant country,

00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:28.820
it has also been a country which
practiced slavery for a while,

00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:31.790
and much of the country was
built on the backs of slaves.

00:26:31.790 --> 00:26:35.060
It's also been a country where
the Native Americans were

00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:36.560
victims of really genocide.

00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:39.800
So there's an underbelly, too,
that exists simultaneously.

00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:42.720
And what Trump is
doing is appealing

00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:48.210
to that sense of pride and
domination and strength.

00:26:48.210 --> 00:26:52.890
And the question
is, how can people

00:26:52.890 --> 00:27:00.360
like Le Pen, Trump, and Hofer--
Hofer, right-- Hofer rise?

00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:03.590
Because frankly, they are a
bit ridiculous, and ludicrous,

00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:04.301
actually.

00:27:04.301 --> 00:27:04.800
Think of it.

00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:08.280
So was Hitler with his
mustache and crappy hair.

00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:09.880
[LAUGHING]

00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:10.940
Right?

00:27:10.940 --> 00:27:12.930
And all his strange gestures.

00:27:12.930 --> 00:27:14.496
He didn't look Aryan.

00:27:14.496 --> 00:27:16.370
I mean, he looked many
things, but not Aryan.

00:27:16.370 --> 00:27:17.740
Not his own version of Aryan.

00:27:17.740 --> 00:27:21.250
He wasn't a tall, blonde,
particularly manly chap.

00:27:21.250 --> 00:27:23.440
After all, he had one ball.

00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:25.880
He didn't even have two balls.

00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:31.300
Now, so how are these ridiculous
figures coming to power?

00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:32.830
And I have a premise.

00:27:32.830 --> 00:27:34.830
And I have ideas.

00:27:34.830 --> 00:27:37.050
I have three arguments.

00:27:37.050 --> 00:27:40.540
Like a good Oxford debater, you
always have three arguments.

00:27:40.540 --> 00:27:43.660
Argument one is the far
right is rising because

00:27:43.660 --> 00:27:48.150
of the failures of the
elites, the multiple failures

00:27:48.150 --> 00:27:49.660
of the elites.

00:27:49.660 --> 00:27:55.200
The second argument is
the rise of inequality.

00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:59.300
And inequality that is not
just income, that is not just

00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:00.695
wealth, but also educational.

00:28:03.650 --> 00:28:07.430
Social mobility is dropping
in large parts of the world.

00:28:07.430 --> 00:28:09.980
And that is really
disconcerting.

00:28:09.980 --> 00:28:16.200
And the third argument is a
failure of collective identity.

00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:24.470
By that, I mean not just who
we are, whether we are-- let's

00:28:24.470 --> 00:28:26.750
say if you're
living in Barcelona,

00:28:26.750 --> 00:28:29.220
whether you are a Barcelone,
or a Catalon, or a Spaniard,

00:28:29.220 --> 00:28:33.080
but it is also a
collapse of community.

00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:35.940
And you can see that in
many parts of the world.

00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:39.910
So let us go to argument one.

00:28:39.910 --> 00:28:43.560
Argument one, the multiple
failures of elites.

00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:52.450
Now if you look at Brussels, a
lot has happened in Brussels.

00:28:52.450 --> 00:28:55.340
The EU has brought trade.

00:28:55.340 --> 00:29:00.000
The EU has brought the Schengen
agreement, which allows

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:01.350
people to travel in and out.

00:29:01.350 --> 00:29:07.240
It has allowed mobility of
goods, services, and people.

00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:12.390
But it is also a place that
is narrow and technocratic.

00:29:12.390 --> 00:29:15.570
It is far too removed from
the lives of the people.

00:29:15.570 --> 00:29:17.250
It is opaque.

00:29:17.250 --> 00:29:19.100
It is wasteful.

00:29:19.100 --> 00:29:21.340
The EU parliament
in Strasbourg is

00:29:21.340 --> 00:29:25.460
something the parliament just
travels to for a few days,

00:29:25.460 --> 00:29:27.510
for a huge waste.

00:29:27.510 --> 00:29:29.720
And because this
has been written,

00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:33.400
a treaty now-- amending a
treaty is too complicated.

00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:39.370
And the waste and the
disconnect that the EU

00:29:39.370 --> 00:29:41.860
has acquired from the
lives of the people

00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:44.640
is breeding a resentment.

00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:51.100
Because at the end of the
day, narrow and technocratic

00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:55.350
leadership is not enough.

00:29:55.350 --> 00:29:58.060
There has to be a vision
of where you are headed,

00:29:58.060 --> 00:30:01.560
what you are doing, and
some fundamental delivery

00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:06.180
of solutions when a crisis hits.

00:30:06.180 --> 00:30:08.010
And a crisis has hit Europe.

00:30:08.010 --> 00:30:09.900
Europe has multiple problems.

00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:11.870
The Euro is not exactly working.

00:30:11.870 --> 00:30:15.060
There is a debt crisis, partly
because the euro was rushed,

00:30:15.060 --> 00:30:17.765
and countries like
Greece and Italy

00:30:17.765 --> 00:30:23.720
hired Goldman-Sachs-- you
know, did creative accounting.

00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:26.730
And that creative
accounting led them in,

00:30:26.730 --> 00:30:29.245
and then everyone lent
to them, thinking now

00:30:29.245 --> 00:30:31.120
that you had the euro,
everyone was the same,

00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:32.703
everyone was Germany,
and the chickens

00:30:32.703 --> 00:30:34.960
have come home to roost.

00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:38.830
And when the crisis came, the
reaction of European elites

00:30:38.830 --> 00:30:42.720
was of typical
petty bureaucrats.

00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:45.590
And people may not
understand what is wrong,

00:30:45.590 --> 00:30:47.430
but they know
something is wrong.

00:30:47.430 --> 00:30:51.650
And they want certain
answers, or some

00:30:51.650 --> 00:30:55.290
promises of solutions, which
are somewhat acted upon,

00:30:55.290 --> 00:30:57.440
if not in their entirety.

00:30:57.440 --> 00:30:59.620
Now let's take another
example of immigration.

00:30:59.620 --> 00:31:01.890
Immigration is an issue.

00:31:01.890 --> 00:31:06.540
Yesterday, I was sitting with
a few Germans, all of whom

00:31:06.540 --> 00:31:09.270
are very anti-far
right, but all of whom

00:31:09.270 --> 00:31:10.760
were talking about
how immigrants

00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:14.020
have started posing a problem
to safety-- some sections,

00:31:14.020 --> 00:31:15.400
not all.

00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:19.110
And they talked about a
family that their friends

00:31:19.110 --> 00:31:20.170
had sheltered.

00:31:20.170 --> 00:31:23.330
They had come through very
traumatic circumstances.

00:31:23.330 --> 00:31:28.170
And the young kids would go to
school and beat up other kids.

00:31:28.170 --> 00:31:30.796
Because if you come from
traumatic circumstances,

00:31:30.796 --> 00:31:32.670
you are traumatized,
and now suddenly, you're

00:31:32.670 --> 00:31:36.770
with other kids, and you're
socialized in a certain way.

00:31:36.770 --> 00:31:38.010
And that is a problem.

00:31:38.010 --> 00:31:42.490
Immigration, which is too
high, which happens too fast,

00:31:42.490 --> 00:31:45.790
creates social pressures,
particularly if you're

00:31:45.790 --> 00:31:51.520
coming from a conservative
society to a slightly,

00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:56.610
shall we say, open
and hedonistic one.

00:31:56.610 --> 00:32:00.700
For instance, New Year's Eve
in Germany led to mass attacks

00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:01.300
on women.

00:32:01.300 --> 00:32:02.130
Some were raped.

00:32:04.930 --> 00:32:09.510
And the government tried to
push it under the carpet.

00:32:09.510 --> 00:32:11.550
That creates anger.

00:32:11.550 --> 00:32:14.070
The response of the elites,
whether it is security,

00:32:14.070 --> 00:32:17.060
whether it is immigration,
whether it is economics,

00:32:17.060 --> 00:32:22.030
has been very much a bit
like Marie Antoinette, which

00:32:22.030 --> 00:32:24.970
was when the revolution
began, we have no bread,

00:32:24.970 --> 00:32:27.530
and she said, why don't
they eat cakes instead?

00:32:27.530 --> 00:32:29.290
And that riles up people.

00:32:29.290 --> 00:32:30.960
And that's premise one.

00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:33.790
And the failure is
not just in Brussels.

00:32:33.790 --> 00:32:36.200
The failure is in
London, in Paris.

00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:37.620
Look at Hollande.

00:32:37.620 --> 00:32:43.210
Hollande is like a
chubby bank clerk.

00:32:43.210 --> 00:32:47.450
And I don't mean to be
insulting to bank clerks.

00:32:47.450 --> 00:32:49.630
I think they are very
dignified and do a great job.

00:32:49.630 --> 00:32:53.360
I just think that
Hollande as the president

00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:56.930
is expected to exude a
certain sense of direction,

00:32:56.930 --> 00:32:57.480
some vision.

00:32:57.480 --> 00:33:01.830
And Hollande is lost.

00:33:01.830 --> 00:33:04.130
His suit is far too big for him.

00:33:04.130 --> 00:33:06.600
And people resent that failure.

00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:09.930
Come to Washington, DC,
and I am sure all of you

00:33:09.930 --> 00:33:11.520
are well familiar with this.

00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:14.780
You come to
Washington, DC, the way

00:33:14.780 --> 00:33:18.400
the institutions have now
come to a grinding halt--

00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:20.820
forget the partisan politics.

00:33:20.820 --> 00:33:23.270
That is a problem in itself.

00:33:23.270 --> 00:33:26.410
Let's take the example of
congressmen and senators.

00:33:26.410 --> 00:33:29.970
Let's say Joseph was a
senator, or a congressman.

00:33:29.970 --> 00:33:31.380
Let's start with a Congressman.

00:33:31.380 --> 00:33:33.990
If he was in a
swing seat, he would

00:33:33.990 --> 00:33:36.720
be fundraising constantly.

00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:43.180
I have friends who are raising
on average $18,0000 to $25,000

00:33:43.180 --> 00:33:46.850
a day for all their term.

00:33:46.850 --> 00:33:50.732
Now, if you are
raising $825,000 a day,

00:33:50.732 --> 00:33:52.190
how many hours in
the day does that

00:33:52.190 --> 00:33:56.430
leave you for
writing legislation?

00:33:56.430 --> 00:33:58.480
Then you wonder why
legislation is so shoddy.

00:33:58.480 --> 00:34:00.140
Well, there's a reason why. .

00:34:00.140 --> 00:34:03.790
How much time does it leave you
for sitting on the committee

00:34:03.790 --> 00:34:07.230
and holding the feet of
the executive to the fire?

00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:10.940
Do the math.

00:34:10.940 --> 00:34:12.886
I mean, you're all engineers.

00:34:12.886 --> 00:34:18.810
The point is that a
lot of the capitals

00:34:18.810 --> 00:34:19.960
are fundamentally broken.

00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:22.500
The institutions haven't
evolved with the times.

00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:24.290
So that's failure one.

00:34:24.290 --> 00:34:25.909
Failure two, inequality.

00:34:25.909 --> 00:34:28.210
I won't belabor this point.

00:34:28.210 --> 00:34:29.560
There are statistics galore.

00:34:29.560 --> 00:34:32.860
I have kept writing about
this issue for a year.

00:34:32.860 --> 00:34:35.000
And these are not my figures.

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.389
You look at figures
from the White House

00:34:37.389 --> 00:34:38.989
Council of Economic Advisers.

00:34:38.989 --> 00:34:40.610
You look at OECD figures.

00:34:40.610 --> 00:34:43.320
You look at figures from
practically every government,

00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:47.719
and you see that income
inequality, wealth inequality,

00:34:47.719 --> 00:34:51.905
educational inequality--
all of these have gone up,

00:34:51.905 --> 00:34:55.170
and social mobility
has gone down.

00:34:55.170 --> 00:34:57.440
And when you don't
have this feeling

00:34:57.440 --> 00:34:59.220
that there is
opportunity, there is

00:34:59.220 --> 00:35:02.450
anger, particularly
if people have

00:35:02.450 --> 00:35:04.170
come to expect
opportunity, people

00:35:04.170 --> 00:35:08.120
have come to expect a
lifestyle through media, which

00:35:08.120 --> 00:35:10.310
is more affluent,
particularly if you have

00:35:10.310 --> 00:35:13.460
an age of consumerism, where
people define themselves

00:35:13.460 --> 00:35:16.150
by what they have and what we
consume, instead of what we do

00:35:16.150 --> 00:35:18.320
and who they are.

00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:24.100
And so, inequality is a major
reason for a lot of anger.

00:35:24.100 --> 00:35:26.590
And part of it is
because of technology.

00:35:26.590 --> 00:35:32.970
Part of it is a broader secular
trend of quantitative easing.

00:35:32.970 --> 00:35:34.620
If you print a lot
of money, and it

00:35:34.620 --> 00:35:37.620
doesn't show up in inflation,
then asset prices go up.

00:35:37.620 --> 00:35:40.380
So those who own houses
and those who own shares,

00:35:40.380 --> 00:35:41.474
they are wealthier.

00:35:41.474 --> 00:35:42.890
And those who,
don't they can just

00:35:42.890 --> 00:35:49.470
continue cleaning their
rubbish, and giving massages,

00:35:49.470 --> 00:35:51.780
and teaching yoga.

00:35:51.780 --> 00:35:58.390
But that tension that comes
in with the combination

00:35:58.390 --> 00:36:03.800
of increasing
automation, with not just

00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:08.070
let's see physical jobs as
in a car factory, but also

00:36:08.070 --> 00:36:11.820
all increasingly skilled jobs
with artificial intelligence,

00:36:11.820 --> 00:36:13.840
where you don't need
that many people,

00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:15.900
and combine that with
quantitative easing,

00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:20.480
it makes for a grim spectacle,
and people get angry.

00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:23.680
How do they find things to
do to fill their time with?

00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:26.650
And how do they earn
their daily bread?

00:36:26.650 --> 00:36:28.390
Now, the third
thing-- and this, I

00:36:28.390 --> 00:36:30.260
think is fundamental
and often overlooked--

00:36:30.260 --> 00:36:33.810
is this idea of
collective identity.

00:36:33.810 --> 00:36:35.070
Who are we as a people?

00:36:35.070 --> 00:36:36.650
Man is a social animal.

00:36:36.650 --> 00:36:38.190
Plato said that a long time ago.

00:36:38.190 --> 00:36:41.130
All the Eastern
philosophers have said it.

00:36:41.130 --> 00:36:45.940
You don't exist as an
island, or man, or woman.

00:36:45.940 --> 00:36:53.030
There is a set of weaving,
inextricable, intricate

00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:56.970
relationships that
every individual

00:36:56.970 --> 00:36:59.570
manages to have through life.

00:36:59.570 --> 00:37:05.370
And if you get isolated,
it creates a lot of anger.

00:37:05.370 --> 00:37:12.130
And what has happened is that
communities have sort of broken

00:37:12.130 --> 00:37:13.530
down in the age of consumerism.

00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:23.400
Neighborhoods lack cohesion
in large parts of the world.

00:37:23.400 --> 00:37:29.000
You take the example
of India, where

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:33.640
you have enormous violence
now in the north, where

00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:39.570
rape is a real and tangible
concern for any woman going out

00:37:39.570 --> 00:37:42.690
in the evening in the north.

00:37:42.690 --> 00:37:53.160
You take, for instance, this
issue of enormous PTSD amongst

00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:54.880
US demobilized troops.

00:37:57.970 --> 00:38:00.560
In the older times-- not
that things were perfect.

00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:02.310
Things were terrible
in many ways then.

00:38:02.310 --> 00:38:05.050
We had serfdom, and
slavery, and whatnot.

00:38:05.050 --> 00:38:06.800
But in the older
times, often when

00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:08.410
soldiers came back
from war, they

00:38:08.410 --> 00:38:09.590
went back to their village.

00:38:09.590 --> 00:38:12.620
They had a whole community
support structure.

00:38:12.620 --> 00:38:16.410
Now when you come back, you're
coming back to a suburb.

00:38:16.410 --> 00:38:18.120
You might end up
having a divorce.

00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:19.330
Your wife may leave you.

00:38:19.330 --> 00:38:22.500
You may end up getting
into a spiral of addiction.

00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:26.790
You may not have that support
structure of the community.

00:38:26.790 --> 00:38:30.560
And that lack of community
support structure,

00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:34.770
that lack of autonomy,
self-autonomy,

00:38:34.770 --> 00:38:39.050
leads to not just anger
but also identity.

00:38:39.050 --> 00:38:41.515
And Freud talked
about this a lot.

00:38:41.515 --> 00:38:44.970
He talked about it as
Nazis move on the rise,

00:38:44.970 --> 00:38:52.040
and his insight was that there
are destructive forces that

00:38:52.040 --> 00:38:57.490
lurk and emerge, particularly
in times of crisis.

00:38:57.490 --> 00:39:02.210
And during these moments,
when this happens,

00:39:02.210 --> 00:39:07.380
then people look for
certain certitudes in life.

00:39:07.380 --> 00:39:12.280
And that certitude
can be very appealing

00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:15.290
if it harks back
to a golden age.

00:39:15.290 --> 00:39:18.850
The Nazis were harking
back to a golden age,

00:39:18.850 --> 00:39:23.070
a pristine age of
the idyllic identity,

00:39:23.070 --> 00:39:25.310
the folk memory of Germany.

00:39:25.310 --> 00:39:27.980
If you look at Islamic
State, what does it say?

00:39:27.980 --> 00:39:30.310
It says there is
this book, right?

00:39:30.310 --> 00:39:33.410
The Koran.

00:39:33.410 --> 00:39:35.775
This gives you an entire
template of life and afterlife.

00:39:38.900 --> 00:39:41.130
Describes everything.

00:39:41.130 --> 00:39:42.166
And this is it.

00:39:44.680 --> 00:39:47.970
This will be your salvation.

00:39:47.970 --> 00:39:56.640
It's a very powerful appeal
if you believe in faith.

00:39:56.640 --> 00:40:01.130
Now, a lot of times when people
believe in religion, it just

00:40:01.130 --> 00:40:05.550
helps them provide an
expression of spirituality.

00:40:05.550 --> 00:40:12.500
It helps them gain a sense
of cultural continuity,

00:40:12.500 --> 00:40:18.900
and it is a fulcrum
of a community.

00:40:18.900 --> 00:40:21.960
But when things become
literal, and fanatical,

00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:23.890
and you have priests
who are telling you

00:40:23.890 --> 00:40:28.060
what these books mean--
whether it is this book, which

00:40:28.060 --> 00:40:30.940
is the Bible, of course,
which a lot of people

00:40:30.940 --> 00:40:32.820
hark back to in this country.

00:40:32.820 --> 00:40:37.480
And they say, check
the Bible, and they

00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:41.030
claim that this is the
reason why you shouldn't have

00:40:41.030 --> 00:40:43.170
a right to abortion, or
this is the reason why you

00:40:43.170 --> 00:40:46.220
should support x and oppose y.

00:40:46.220 --> 00:40:50.710
You're getting an absolutist,
fundamentalist point of view

00:40:50.710 --> 00:40:54.030
that harks back to a pristine
golden age, that harks back

00:40:54.030 --> 00:40:56.860
to certitude and truth,
that harks back to clearly

00:40:56.860 --> 00:40:59.850
codified definitions.

00:40:59.850 --> 00:41:03.505
That provides you
a map of everything

00:41:03.505 --> 00:41:07.340
at a time of great
volatility and uncertainty.

00:41:07.340 --> 00:41:10.270
But just before people
jump to the conclusion

00:41:10.270 --> 00:41:15.670
and say all religion
is bad, the flip side

00:41:15.670 --> 00:41:20.880
is that any ideology-- not just
religion, which revolves around

00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:25.260
far too much certitude,
whether it is Nazi

00:41:25.260 --> 00:41:27.850
thought as penned by
Adolf Hitler in "Mein

00:41:27.850 --> 00:41:31.300
Kampf," whether it is Stalin,
Joseph Stalin, and his idea

00:41:31.300 --> 00:41:36.280
of fundamentalist
communism, or it is even

00:41:36.280 --> 00:41:38.940
Mustafa Kemal and his
idea of Turkification,

00:41:38.940 --> 00:41:40.530
which was terrible
for the Turks,

00:41:40.530 --> 00:41:43.560
by the way-- sorry,
terrible for the Kurds.

00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:46.720
Any idea that bases
itself on the certitude

00:41:46.720 --> 00:41:51.210
of a collective identity that is
ethnic, or religious, or racial

00:41:51.210 --> 00:41:56.080
ends up in a lot
of blood and tears.

00:41:56.080 --> 00:41:58.160
And perhaps that is part
of the human condition,

00:41:58.160 --> 00:42:01.890
because we like to define
ourselves in tribes after all.

00:42:01.890 --> 00:42:06.020
Here at Google, you wear
your tribal signifiers.

00:42:06.020 --> 00:42:08.230
I see Google t-shirts.

00:42:08.230 --> 00:42:14.160
And we want to believe in some
kind of collective mission

00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:15.900
and identity.

00:42:15.900 --> 00:42:20.950
And perhaps that is in
many ways wonderful,

00:42:20.950 --> 00:42:24.980
because it allows people
some common identity,

00:42:24.980 --> 00:42:27.980
common purpose,
and common goals.

00:42:27.980 --> 00:42:33.690
But when it's taken to
an unhealthy degree.

00:42:33.690 --> 00:42:39.720
When it is taken to an
irrational belief that

00:42:39.720 --> 00:42:42.840
is beyond questioning,
that is beyond dialogue,

00:42:42.840 --> 00:42:45.650
that is beyond debate,
then the worry begins.

00:42:45.650 --> 00:42:48.170
And the point that
I'm making is,

00:42:48.170 --> 00:42:51.600
these forces, these
forces of irrationality,

00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:57.810
these forces of hearkening back
to comfort and infantile sense

00:42:57.810 --> 00:43:00.670
of security-- which,
actually, Eric Fromm talks

00:43:00.670 --> 00:43:03.810
about in "Escape From Freedom."

00:43:03.810 --> 00:43:05.960
Because freedom can
be a terrifying thing.

00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:07.110
It leads to loneliness.

00:43:07.110 --> 00:43:08.230
It leads to isolation.

00:43:08.230 --> 00:43:10.300
It leads to atomization.

00:43:10.300 --> 00:43:12.590
If we are disconnected
from each other,

00:43:12.590 --> 00:43:14.300
from one individual
from another,

00:43:14.300 --> 00:43:16.660
or if there are far
too many uncertainties,

00:43:16.660 --> 00:43:20.890
then we want to go back to a
comforting infantile state,

00:43:20.890 --> 00:43:22.590
back to being a child.

00:43:22.590 --> 00:43:24.440
But as an adult,
it's not possible.

00:43:24.440 --> 00:43:26.860
And therefore, you
seek this connection

00:43:26.860 --> 00:43:30.270
with a father figure, with an
authoritarian father figure,

00:43:30.270 --> 00:43:33.650
who promises peace and
tranquility, and a happy family

00:43:33.650 --> 00:43:36.240
in the Garden of Eden.

00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:38.210
It doesn't quite work that way.

00:43:38.210 --> 00:43:41.780
But this collapse is
particularly important.

00:43:41.780 --> 00:43:45.040
After all, who are we?

00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:48.200
What is our tribe?

00:43:48.200 --> 00:43:50.300
How do we base it on?

00:43:50.300 --> 00:43:52.280
How do we base our
collective identities

00:43:52.280 --> 00:43:53.680
and collective purpose on?

00:43:53.680 --> 00:43:55.990
And we've not been
able to define that.

00:43:55.990 --> 00:43:59.520
We've not been able
to put together

00:43:59.520 --> 00:44:07.240
a vision of a truly diverse,
truly inclusive community.

00:44:07.240 --> 00:44:10.410
There has been this
loss of, in some ways,

00:44:10.410 --> 00:44:12.350
and the chipping
away of the soul.

00:44:12.350 --> 00:44:18.520
And that is the big challenge
that irreligiosity has brought.

00:44:18.520 --> 00:44:22.890
Because being highly religious
has its own problems sometimes.

00:44:22.890 --> 00:44:24.570
Everything is me,
me, and myself.

00:44:24.570 --> 00:44:28.260
Everything is what I consume.

00:44:28.260 --> 00:44:33.160
And so for me, if we have
to beat the far right--

00:44:33.160 --> 00:44:35.840
and we have to
beat the far right,

00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:38.310
because it's a hugely
destructive force

00:44:38.310 --> 00:44:39.500
on the planet.

00:44:39.500 --> 00:44:41.410
It is very regressive.

00:44:41.410 --> 00:44:44.240
We have to address
three challenges.

00:44:44.240 --> 00:44:51.490
We have to come up with a more
coherent vision, whether it

00:44:51.490 --> 00:44:56.740
is the economy, or
whether it is, identity,

00:44:56.740 --> 00:45:00.480
or whether it is any
problem or challenge that

00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:03.030
is affecting the lives of many.

00:45:03.030 --> 00:45:06.440
We have to address
inequality, and we

00:45:06.440 --> 00:45:10.610
have to come up with ideas
of collective identity--

00:45:10.610 --> 00:45:14.970
some kind of global citizenship,
some kind of template

00:45:14.970 --> 00:45:20.230
and vision for commonality,
some kind of moral purpose.

00:45:20.230 --> 00:45:25.320
And if we've got so
even the keel again.

00:45:25.320 --> 00:45:27.680
And with that, I
welcome questions.

00:45:27.680 --> 00:45:29.440
Thank you so much for your time.

00:45:29.440 --> 00:45:31.040
It's been a pleasure
and an honor.

00:45:31.040 --> 00:45:32.230
Thank you.

00:45:32.230 --> 00:45:35.330
[APPLAUSE]

00:45:35.770 --> 00:45:36.270
Please.

00:45:36.270 --> 00:45:37.150
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:45:37.150 --> 00:45:38.180
Thanks for your talk.

00:45:38.180 --> 00:45:40.610
Very, very informative.

00:45:40.610 --> 00:45:43.300
I have extended family
members who are Europeans.

00:45:43.300 --> 00:45:45.900
Very early in the Trump
campaign, when I was still

00:45:45.900 --> 00:45:49.190
kind of in the
eye-rolling stage,

00:45:49.190 --> 00:45:51.080
they said, oh, we've
seen this before.

00:45:51.080 --> 00:45:52.730
It's fascism.

00:45:52.730 --> 00:45:56.980
And that word really
kind of got my attention,

00:45:56.980 --> 00:45:59.630
and brought me to
focus on the fact

00:45:59.630 --> 00:46:04.140
that Trump represented
a portal to devolvement

00:46:04.140 --> 00:46:07.030
that we needed to keep shut.

00:46:07.030 --> 00:46:09.810
I was curious-- I don't think
I heard you use that word,

00:46:09.810 --> 00:46:13.440
and I wondered if you think
of fascism differently.

00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:14.940
And if so, what are
the differences?

00:46:14.940 --> 00:46:17.010
Or why do you shy
away from that word?

00:46:17.010 --> 00:46:20.850
ATUL SINGH: A 14-year-old or
a 12-year-old-- 14-year-old

00:46:20.850 --> 00:46:23.330
asked me the same
question on Sunday.

00:46:23.330 --> 00:46:27.750
So it's glad to see a very
perceptive question coming

00:46:27.750 --> 00:46:30.790
from two different generations.

00:46:30.790 --> 00:46:33.700
And the reason I don't
use the word fascism

00:46:33.700 --> 00:46:37.400
is because fascism is just
one of the many center-right

00:46:37.400 --> 00:46:39.180
ideologies that evolved.

00:46:39.180 --> 00:46:40.620
It has become very popular.

00:46:40.620 --> 00:46:42.460
It's become a term
that is bandied around.

00:46:42.460 --> 00:46:42.959
It's.

00:46:42.959 --> 00:46:46.200
Basically Mussolini's ideology.

00:46:46.200 --> 00:46:48.890
You know, bare-chested,
thumping his chest,

00:46:48.890 --> 00:46:52.060
and going and
working as a worker,

00:46:52.060 --> 00:46:56.100
and at the same time talking
about grand nationhood.

00:46:56.100 --> 00:46:58.710
It's a weak form of Nazism.

00:46:58.710 --> 00:47:05.270
And a so, yes,
fascism, he's fascist.

00:47:05.270 --> 00:47:07.670
We could use a word,
oh, he is far right.

00:47:07.670 --> 00:47:09.910
Or we could see he's proto-Nazi.

00:47:09.910 --> 00:47:12.420
But these are terms.

00:47:12.420 --> 00:47:17.440
I don't like using fascism,
because fascism is a peculiarly

00:47:17.440 --> 00:47:19.240
Italian phenomenon.

00:47:19.240 --> 00:47:21.270
And I think every country
has its own version

00:47:21.270 --> 00:47:22.390
of the far right.

00:47:22.390 --> 00:47:24.560
For me, what is much
more dangerous--

00:47:24.560 --> 00:47:27.570
and what we have to keep
sight of-- is the way

00:47:27.570 --> 00:47:35.120
Trump is attacking ethnicities
and people of different faiths.

00:47:35.120 --> 00:47:39.250
Now, the classic example is
this young Muslim captain

00:47:39.250 --> 00:47:40.460
who was killed.

00:47:40.460 --> 00:47:44.780
Now in America, yes,
the elite does not

00:47:44.780 --> 00:47:47.370
send its children to fight.

00:47:47.370 --> 00:47:49.810
None of the Googler's kids
are likely to go and fight,

00:47:49.810 --> 00:47:51.840
unlike the British
upper classes,

00:47:51.840 --> 00:47:54.000
who did in the First World War.

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:58.190
But in America, there is
a veneration for soldiers

00:47:58.190 --> 00:48:01.720
and the war dead,
at least publicly.

00:48:01.720 --> 00:48:03.420
And that's an unwritten rule.

00:48:03.420 --> 00:48:05.410
You always see, we
honor our veterans,

00:48:05.410 --> 00:48:07.270
we honor our soldiers,
we honor our airmen,

00:48:07.270 --> 00:48:08.600
we honor our sailors.

00:48:08.600 --> 00:48:13.760
Of course, we won't let our kids
become them, but we honor them.

00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:18.170
What Trump is doing is that
he's attacking someone who

00:48:18.170 --> 00:48:21.660
died fighting for the country.

00:48:21.660 --> 00:48:28.960
And in the American
mythology, is almost a saint.

00:48:28.960 --> 00:48:33.730
And he's doing it only
on the basis of a Muslim.

00:48:33.730 --> 00:48:35.851
And he attacks the mother
and says she was silent.

00:48:35.851 --> 00:48:37.600
Maybe she wasn't allowed
to say something.

00:48:37.600 --> 00:48:45.930
What he's trying to do is
conjure up a specter of Islam

00:48:45.930 --> 00:48:50.320
wherein women are
not given rights.

00:48:50.320 --> 00:48:57.230
He's playing into those fears,
where those who are gay,

00:48:57.230 --> 00:49:01.660
like Peter Thiel, will
be shot dead or burnt

00:49:01.660 --> 00:49:06.740
alive, where real intolerance
is the name of the game.

00:49:06.740 --> 00:49:09.250
He's helped by the fact, of
course, that certain incidents

00:49:09.250 --> 00:49:10.540
do happen.

00:49:10.540 --> 00:49:16.950
Men from North Africa do attack
German women in public pools.

00:49:16.950 --> 00:49:18.940
That is happening.

00:49:18.940 --> 00:49:21.750
But that is not all of Islam.

00:49:21.750 --> 00:49:22.350
Right?

00:49:22.350 --> 00:49:24.630
That may be from that society.

00:49:24.630 --> 00:49:26.650
That may be a failure
of German public order.

00:49:26.650 --> 00:49:28.500
That may be many,
many, many things.

00:49:28.500 --> 00:49:34.160
But he's conflating
disorder with Islam.

00:49:34.160 --> 00:49:38.010
It's very much like painting an
image of the blood-dimmed tide

00:49:38.010 --> 00:49:42.460
of barbarians is on the
horizon, and they're all

00:49:42.460 --> 00:49:45.670
riding on their steeds, and
they are like the Mongol horde,

00:49:45.670 --> 00:49:49.000
except that they all
have the green crescent,

00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:51.260
and we have to rally
together and fight them.

00:49:51.260 --> 00:49:56.210
So he's basically trying to
pull together white America,

00:49:56.210 --> 00:50:05.460
largely, under his fold against
an extremely dangerous enemy.

00:50:05.460 --> 00:50:07.350
That's the gambit he's playing.

00:50:07.350 --> 00:50:09.810
But I wouldn't like to
use the word fascism,

00:50:09.810 --> 00:50:13.330
because Mussolini didn't
really play that gambit.

00:50:13.330 --> 00:50:15.670
It was more Hitler who did.

00:50:15.670 --> 00:50:20.470
So see, that's why I'm--
Mussolini was Hitler Lite.

00:50:20.470 --> 00:50:24.520
Italy declared war,
and all the sailors

00:50:24.520 --> 00:50:27.330
were out (ITALIAN ACCENT) eating
pasta that with the Mama, huh?

00:50:27.330 --> 00:50:29.420
And the British
bombed the fleet.

00:50:29.420 --> 00:50:31.700
It was on the bottom
of the harbor, huh?

00:50:31.700 --> 00:50:35.720
So for me, Italian politics
is a bit of a joke.

00:50:35.720 --> 00:50:38.440
So Mussolini says we want to
go to war, and we'll go to war.

00:50:38.440 --> 00:50:40.620
But of course, the fleet
is sitting in the harbor.

00:50:40.620 --> 00:50:42.080
And what do the Brits do?

00:50:42.080 --> 00:50:46.870
They come and bomb the fleet,
and it's bottom of the harbor.

00:50:46.870 --> 00:50:51.250
My tutor at Oxford used to say
that his family members used

00:50:51.250 --> 00:50:54.150
to joke that when they went to
fight in the Second World War,

00:50:54.150 --> 00:50:55.970
and they were having
a snowball fight,

00:50:55.970 --> 00:50:58.750
the Italians came out saying,
Mama Mia, don't shoot,

00:50:58.750 --> 00:51:00.060
we surrender.

00:51:00.060 --> 00:51:02.700
So you know,
fascism is something

00:51:02.700 --> 00:51:09.020
which is a term which, for
me, is in some ways cliched.

00:51:09.020 --> 00:51:12.270
What is more important
to understand

00:51:12.270 --> 00:51:19.870
the danger of a particular
ideology and address it.

00:51:19.870 --> 00:51:21.740
Because if you say
Trump is fascist, then

00:51:21.740 --> 00:51:24.300
you get into a debate,
what is fascism?

00:51:24.300 --> 00:51:25.580
What does this term mean?

00:51:25.580 --> 00:51:27.480
And then people say, well,
he's not entirely fascist,

00:51:27.480 --> 00:51:29.521
because he's different in
this way, and that way,

00:51:29.521 --> 00:51:33.580
and he's representing a
lot of genuine concerns.

00:51:33.580 --> 00:51:35.260
He's against the establishment.

00:51:35.260 --> 00:51:38.780
He is giving voice to workers
who have been suffering

00:51:38.780 --> 00:51:40.904
under free trade agreements.

00:51:40.904 --> 00:51:43.070
AUDIENCE: So this talk has
been about the far right,

00:51:43.070 --> 00:51:46.260
and I agree, that that
is a rising concern.

00:51:46.260 --> 00:51:49.422
But maybe you could
address sort of-- not only

00:51:49.422 --> 00:51:51.380
has there been sort of
a rise of the far right,

00:51:51.380 --> 00:51:54.290
but what I view as a
hollowing out of the middle.

00:51:54.290 --> 00:51:54.790
Right?

00:51:54.790 --> 00:51:57.957
So as the right has
pulled right-- and again,

00:51:57.957 --> 00:51:59.290
I have an American lens on this.

00:51:59.290 --> 00:52:02.354
As the right has pulled right,
the left has pulled left.

00:52:02.354 --> 00:52:03.770
You know, you've
seen the gridlock

00:52:03.770 --> 00:52:06.320
in Washington-- Bernie Sanders,
sort of a personification

00:52:06.320 --> 00:52:08.170
of that left.

00:52:08.170 --> 00:52:10.724
My initial sort of thought
is like, well, let's

00:52:10.724 --> 00:52:11.890
all move towards the center.

00:52:11.890 --> 00:52:13.757
But as someone on
the left, I'm afraid

00:52:13.757 --> 00:52:15.882
that if I move a little
bit to the right, the right

00:52:15.882 --> 00:52:17.470
us going to move even
farther to the right.

00:52:17.470 --> 00:52:18.886
And so, how do you
deal with this,

00:52:18.886 --> 00:52:20.370
again, hollowing
out of the middle.

00:52:20.370 --> 00:52:23.570
ATUL SINGH: I don't know
if the left has really

00:52:23.570 --> 00:52:25.420
moved to the left.

00:52:25.420 --> 00:52:28.710
Because frankly, it is
starting to move to the left

00:52:28.710 --> 00:52:31.080
with the rise of Bernie Sanders.

00:52:31.080 --> 00:52:34.710
But if you look at 1991,
the collapse of the Soviet

00:52:34.710 --> 00:52:38.170
Union and 1989, the collapse
of the Berlin Wall-- Francis

00:52:38.170 --> 00:52:41.260
Fukuyama, who basically
sits not too far from here,

00:52:41.260 --> 00:52:43.050
a little bit further
down in Palo Alto,

00:52:43.050 --> 00:52:45.600
that place called
Stanford, right?

00:52:45.600 --> 00:52:47.380
He said, oh, the end of history.

00:52:47.380 --> 00:52:47.880
Right?

00:52:47.880 --> 00:52:48.796
That's what he called.

00:52:48.796 --> 00:52:52.775
And I remember, even as a young
chap, when I was reading it--

00:52:52.775 --> 00:52:53.650
and I've met Francis.

00:52:53.650 --> 00:52:55.030
He's a lovely chap.

00:52:55.030 --> 00:52:57.510
But only an Americano
could write that.

00:52:57.510 --> 00:52:58.700
I'm sorry.

00:52:58.700 --> 00:53:01.270
I come from Varanasi, which
has 5,000 years of history.

00:53:01.270 --> 00:53:02.960
My ancestral city
is a stone's throw

00:53:02.960 --> 00:53:04.990
from where Buddhism bagan.

00:53:04.990 --> 00:53:10.660
When he wrote "End of
History"-- history never ends.

00:53:10.660 --> 00:53:14.440
There is no final
destination that you get to.

00:53:14.440 --> 00:53:14.950
It evolves.

00:53:14.950 --> 00:53:16.332
It flows like a
meandering river.

00:53:16.332 --> 00:53:18.540
Or maybe I'm just Buddhist,
philosophically Buddhism.

00:53:18.540 --> 00:53:23.690
But anyway, but the
point is post-1991 was

00:53:23.690 --> 00:53:27.140
the triumph of the
Milton Friedman style

00:53:27.140 --> 00:53:31.370
capitalism, which is markets
are all, markets are God.

00:53:31.370 --> 00:53:32.560
Let's privatize everything.

00:53:32.560 --> 00:53:33.390
Well, Russia did.

00:53:33.390 --> 00:53:34.760
What happened?

00:53:34.760 --> 00:53:37.400
You can privatize if
there's is a fair auction.

00:53:37.400 --> 00:53:41.670
But let's say you own-- not you
own, the state owns everything.

00:53:41.670 --> 00:53:43.910
All of you collectively
supposedly own everything,

00:53:43.910 --> 00:53:46.250
but you are the Politburo chief.

00:53:46.250 --> 00:53:48.580
And you say, I'm going to
privatize all the chairs.

00:53:48.580 --> 00:53:49.580
They are to be sold.

00:53:49.580 --> 00:53:51.020
The state cannot control it.

00:53:51.020 --> 00:53:56.090
And it turns out that
chap sitting to your left

00:53:56.090 --> 00:53:57.220
is your brother-in-law.

00:53:57.220 --> 00:54:01.560
And you say, OK, the real price
of all the chairs maybe $100,

00:54:01.560 --> 00:54:05.640
but I'll sell it
to you for $0.10.

00:54:05.640 --> 00:54:09.190
And what's happened in
the move towards market

00:54:09.190 --> 00:54:14.660
was privatization of
public private property

00:54:14.660 --> 00:54:16.390
through criminal means.

00:54:16.390 --> 00:54:19.850
Criminal syndicates
emerged and took charge.

00:54:19.850 --> 00:54:25.152
And you've got to be careful
with things like property

00:54:25.152 --> 00:54:27.610
rights, because if you have a
very extreme property rights,

00:54:27.610 --> 00:54:31.490
you only get a society
of czars and serfs.

00:54:31.490 --> 00:54:34.180
And that's exactly what
Russia has ended up again.

00:54:34.180 --> 00:54:39.220
Now, so through the '90s,
the left moved to the right.

00:54:39.220 --> 00:54:42.610
It was Bill Clinton,
Slick Willie,

00:54:42.610 --> 00:54:46.060
who repealed Glass-Steagall.

00:54:46.060 --> 00:54:46.760
Right?

00:54:46.760 --> 00:54:51.670
It was what FDR had brought
in after the Depression.

00:54:51.670 --> 00:54:56.130
The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act,
if I get the name right.

00:54:56.130 --> 00:54:59.220
It was like, yes, banks
should be allowed to merge,

00:54:59.220 --> 00:55:01.470
and financial services
will be wonderful.

00:55:01.470 --> 00:55:02.920
Let's have lots of derivatives.

00:55:02.920 --> 00:55:06.760
And his Treasury Secretary
was an ex-Goldman chief.

00:55:06.760 --> 00:55:11.330
And then, of course, the
supremely arrogant Larry

00:55:11.330 --> 00:55:12.901
Summers was the big boss.

00:55:12.901 --> 00:55:14.400
And of course,
what's the difference

00:55:14.400 --> 00:55:16.170
between Larry Summers and God?

00:55:16.170 --> 00:55:19.680
Well, you could take what
someone said about Larry

00:55:19.680 --> 00:55:21.990
Ellison and replace it.

00:55:21.990 --> 00:55:24.190
And they were
doctrinaire in the belief

00:55:24.190 --> 00:55:27.820
that you just had
to liberate markets.

00:55:27.820 --> 00:55:29.860
And it was a
Democrat government.

00:55:29.860 --> 00:55:32.130
It was a Democrat
president who did that.

00:55:32.130 --> 00:55:33.962
Now obviously, these
were the excesses,

00:55:33.962 --> 00:55:35.420
because Soviet
Union had collapsed.

00:55:35.420 --> 00:55:38.910
Everyone had this naive
belief in the markets.

00:55:38.910 --> 00:55:41.670
I called Bill Clinton the
stepchild of Ronald Reagan.

00:55:41.670 --> 00:55:43.130
I'm sure he doesn't like it.

00:55:43.130 --> 00:55:46.370
But he was in economics.

00:55:46.370 --> 00:55:47.920
He certainly was.

00:55:47.920 --> 00:55:51.500
And so, the left
moves to the right.

00:55:51.500 --> 00:55:54.300
And then who represents
the working classes?

00:55:54.300 --> 00:56:00.800
The white working class suffered
as jobs moved, and is angry.

00:56:00.800 --> 00:56:04.660
And that is why, ironically,
it is flocking to Trump,

00:56:04.660 --> 00:56:09.750
because Trump is personifying
anger against the system.

00:56:09.750 --> 00:56:11.869
Because right now,
you're seeing two forces.

00:56:11.869 --> 00:56:12.910
One is the establishment.

00:56:12.910 --> 00:56:15.800
And the establishment are people
who sit in Washington, DC,

00:56:15.800 --> 00:56:17.760
or dare I say,
even Google-- those

00:56:17.760 --> 00:56:19.480
who have benefited
from globalization.

00:56:19.480 --> 00:56:19.980
Why?

00:56:19.980 --> 00:56:21.440
Because everyone
uses Google Maps.

00:56:21.440 --> 00:56:23.380
Everyone uses Google Search.

00:56:23.380 --> 00:56:25.160
I couldn't live without Google.

00:56:25.160 --> 00:56:28.740
I function off G-mail, and
I function off Google Docs.

00:56:28.740 --> 00:56:32.940
So I am, whether I like it
or not, in the Google Empire,

00:56:32.940 --> 00:56:35.380
in the Google Ecosystem.

00:56:35.380 --> 00:56:37.460
I couldn't leave it,
even if I wanted.

00:56:37.460 --> 00:56:40.800
So Google is a big
winner of globalization.

00:56:40.800 --> 00:56:42.970
But then there are
those who are really

00:56:42.970 --> 00:56:45.020
against the establishment,
who've lost out,

00:56:45.020 --> 00:56:48.310
and they want to smash
it to smithereens,

00:56:48.310 --> 00:56:51.090
because their concerns
were not addressed.

00:56:51.090 --> 00:56:53.730
They were never trained.

00:56:53.730 --> 00:56:55.970
They suffered the
Reagan Revolution,

00:56:55.970 --> 00:56:59.180
wherein investment in
the criminal justice

00:56:59.180 --> 00:57:04.370
system in prison
succeeded that on schools.

00:57:04.370 --> 00:57:07.261
Today, a lot of
Americans are starting

00:57:07.261 --> 00:57:09.760
to send their kids to private
school, fancy private schools.

00:57:09.760 --> 00:57:12.850
I know some friends here.

00:57:12.850 --> 00:57:15.550
So if you've gutted
out your public school

00:57:15.550 --> 00:57:18.270
system, that means
social mobility is gone,

00:57:18.270 --> 00:57:19.800
jobs are gone.

00:57:19.800 --> 00:57:22.130
You can, of course,
become a barista.

00:57:22.130 --> 00:57:23.650
But better jobs
are not available.

00:57:23.650 --> 00:57:27.980
So you know, there was
this entire abandonment

00:57:27.980 --> 00:57:32.060
all of the economic interests,
of large numbers of people.

00:57:32.060 --> 00:57:33.980
So the left moved to the right.

00:57:33.980 --> 00:57:37.560
And it's only recently
that the left has

00:57:37.560 --> 00:57:39.410
started swinging left again.

00:57:39.410 --> 00:57:41.850
But now Marx is dead.

00:57:41.850 --> 00:57:42.730
All right?

00:57:42.730 --> 00:57:45.620
There is no counterpoint,
so they're confused.

00:57:45.620 --> 00:57:47.130
They don't know what they want.

00:57:47.130 --> 00:57:50.360
So the left is in complete
confusion anywhere you look.

00:57:50.360 --> 00:57:52.170
Look at England.

00:57:52.170 --> 00:57:53.310
Jeremy Corbyn.

00:57:53.310 --> 00:57:57.590
He has no idea of
what he believes in.

00:57:57.590 --> 00:57:59.590
Right?

00:57:59.590 --> 00:58:04.420
So the entire politicking, the
opposition, to David Cameron

00:58:04.420 --> 00:58:05.720
came from his own party.

00:58:05.720 --> 00:58:08.810
It was Boris Johnson
who sank Cameron's boat,

00:58:08.810 --> 00:58:11.810
not of course, the
wonderful opposition leader.

00:58:11.810 --> 00:58:13.530
So the left is lost.

00:58:13.530 --> 00:58:16.800
The left, in the memorable
words of a friend who's

00:58:16.800 --> 00:58:21.930
a young politician, said
the left has been left out.

00:58:21.930 --> 00:58:23.690
So left doesn't
even know who it is.

00:58:23.690 --> 00:58:26.770
So I think the left is sort of
starting to figure things out,

00:58:26.770 --> 00:58:30.050
and has moved to the-- it's
starting to gravitate back

00:58:30.050 --> 00:58:31.500
again under Bernie Sanders.

00:58:31.500 --> 00:58:34.510
But I don't think it's
moved to the right at all.

00:58:34.510 --> 00:58:36.840
And I think what has happened
is that the right has

00:58:36.840 --> 00:58:39.570
moved extreme right.

00:58:39.570 --> 00:58:42.310
The center of gravity
started tending

00:58:42.310 --> 00:58:44.340
towards far too much insanity.

00:58:44.340 --> 00:58:45.560
I mean, look at Ted Cruz.

00:58:45.560 --> 00:58:48.590
He makes Donald Trump look good.

00:58:48.590 --> 00:58:50.680
I mean, pull up the
video, and watch his video

00:58:50.680 --> 00:58:54.960
on machine gun bacon, where he
cooks bacon on a machine gun.

00:58:54.960 --> 00:58:57.140
He fires until it becomes hot.

00:58:57.140 --> 00:59:02.610
And you know, it's a
wonderfully incongruous sight

00:59:02.610 --> 00:59:08.050
to see a chubby middle-aged
man act very macho.

00:59:08.050 --> 00:59:11.290
I mean, I would much
rather he ran a triathlon

00:59:11.290 --> 00:59:13.280
to show me how fit he was.

00:59:13.280 --> 00:59:15.530
But no, he's appealing
to something very deep.

00:59:15.530 --> 00:59:16.930
So what is happening?

00:59:16.930 --> 00:59:20.170
But now, what is happening is
that the economics of the right

00:59:20.170 --> 00:59:20.890
are turning left.

00:59:20.890 --> 00:59:22.500
So it's a very confused time.

00:59:22.500 --> 00:59:24.590
AUDIENCE: Sir, I
think when you're

00:59:24.590 --> 00:59:26.955
looking at fascism
and all these movement

00:59:26.955 --> 00:59:29.350
in history, you're kind
of a little bit scratching

00:59:29.350 --> 00:59:32.505
the surface, making fun of
Italian maybe, and Hitler,

00:59:32.505 --> 00:59:33.270
and his mustache.

00:59:33.270 --> 00:59:37.030
But really, those are like,
counter-revolutionary movements

00:59:37.030 --> 00:59:39.435
against what was happening
in Soviet Russia,

00:59:39.435 --> 00:59:42.117
and there was a moment of
restructuring for capitalism

00:59:42.117 --> 00:59:43.280
worldwide.

00:59:43.280 --> 00:59:46.720
So I think what is really
key is the economic situation

00:59:46.720 --> 00:59:48.780
in the world that
we should look at,

00:59:48.780 --> 00:59:51.840
instead of just looking at Ted
Cruz and how ridiculous it is.

00:59:51.840 --> 00:59:53.650
So I think the key
here is inequality,

00:59:53.650 --> 00:59:59.750
and it was one of your
three like, main points,

00:59:59.750 --> 01:00:01.197
but I think it is
the main point.

01:00:01.197 --> 01:00:03.030
So I want to know what
you think about that.

01:00:03.030 --> 01:00:06.030
ATUL SINGH: It's a
very valid point.

01:00:06.030 --> 01:00:08.540
Yes, inequality is key.

01:00:08.540 --> 01:00:14.480
But remember that the
Nazi party and, let's say,

01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:16.870
Italian fascists, were
strange in the sense they

01:00:16.870 --> 01:00:18.660
were counter-revolutionaries.

01:00:18.660 --> 01:00:21.840
But in some ways, they
were also revolutionaries.

01:00:21.840 --> 01:00:26.240
Because the Nazi Party was not
the upper class Prussian Junker

01:00:26.240 --> 01:00:28.850
class.

01:00:28.850 --> 01:00:29.840
Let's be very clear.

01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:32.800
The Prussian Junker class
suffered under the Nazis.

01:00:32.800 --> 01:00:36.240
The aristocrats often got the
boot, often with their lives.

01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:41.220
It was a lower middle
class, petty bourgeoisie.

01:00:41.220 --> 01:00:43.140
The lower middle
class that wanted

01:00:43.140 --> 01:00:45.840
to keep the upper classes and
take power themselves-- it

01:00:45.840 --> 01:00:47.020
was a power grab.

01:00:47.020 --> 01:00:49.260
But they didn't want the
workers, their workers,

01:00:49.260 --> 01:00:50.610
to take over power.

01:00:50.610 --> 01:00:51.780
So it's a little complex.

01:00:51.780 --> 01:00:53.460
You see what I am getting at?

01:00:53.460 --> 01:00:55.370
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:00:55.370 --> 01:00:57.065
ATUL SINGH: Pardon me?

01:00:57.065 --> 01:00:57.940
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:00:57.940 --> 01:00:59.040
ATUL SINGH: Pardon me?

01:00:59.040 --> 01:00:59.915
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:01:03.270 --> 01:01:05.810
ATUL SINGH: It was a
power grab certainly.

01:01:05.810 --> 01:01:07.290
And certain classes flourished.

01:01:07.290 --> 01:01:10.730
But parts of the old
elite got wiped out too.

01:01:10.730 --> 01:01:13.579
AUDIENCE: A capitalistic
restructuring, right?

01:01:13.579 --> 01:01:14.370
ATUL SINGH: Partly.

01:01:14.370 --> 01:01:15.949
But it was not
entirely capitalistic,

01:01:15.949 --> 01:01:17.240
because the state was involved.

01:01:17.240 --> 01:01:19.170
It was collectivist as well.

01:01:19.170 --> 01:01:20.349
It's complicated.

01:01:20.349 --> 01:01:22.890
That's what I'm trying to get,
is the state, the bureaucrats,

01:01:22.890 --> 01:01:24.310
were very heavily involved.

01:01:24.310 --> 01:01:26.950
And I think you're right.

01:01:26.950 --> 01:01:28.330
Economics is key.

01:01:28.330 --> 01:01:31.930
A long time ago, someone said
it's the economy's stupid.

01:01:31.930 --> 01:01:34.820
And that's part of
the answer, for sure.

01:01:34.820 --> 01:01:38.850
But economics is not all,
because you can not just

01:01:38.850 --> 01:01:41.090
have growth, and
things will be all OK,

01:01:41.090 --> 01:01:42.510
as China has demonstrated.

01:01:42.510 --> 01:01:44.740
But at the same time,
if you have no growth,

01:01:44.740 --> 01:01:47.670
and you're like France, you're
stuck in over 10% unemployment

01:01:47.670 --> 01:01:50.800
since 1980, and you've
got massive unemployment

01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:53.130
in your [INAUDIBLE],
which is where you've

01:01:53.130 --> 01:01:57.701
got all these Arab kids
unemployed and unemployable,

01:01:57.701 --> 01:01:59.200
then they start
getting radicalized,

01:01:59.200 --> 01:02:00.950
as you can see on
the Cote d'Azur.

01:02:00.950 --> 01:02:03.670
Cote d'Azur, which is a
place where the rich stay,

01:02:03.670 --> 01:02:07.020
is also a place where the
radicals come and flourish.

01:02:07.020 --> 01:02:08.170
And the radicals grow.

01:02:08.170 --> 01:02:08.870
So it's complex.

01:02:08.870 --> 01:02:12.040
But I agree that you
have to figure out

01:02:12.040 --> 01:02:15.240
how do people find jobs and
how do people earn a living?

01:02:15.240 --> 01:02:17.610
If they cannot, if we
have so much automation,

01:02:17.610 --> 01:02:20.740
then maybe it's time to think
seriously about what Keynes

01:02:20.740 --> 01:02:21.240
said.

01:02:21.240 --> 01:02:27.610
Maybe we should all be writing
poetry and debating philosophy.

01:02:27.610 --> 01:02:30.880
Build a greater sort
of Athenian Republic,

01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:33.910
now that we don't need slaves,
we can have robots instead.

01:02:33.910 --> 01:02:36.690
AUDIENCE: This question is not
about the global far right,

01:02:36.690 --> 01:02:41.270
but instead about the media.

01:02:41.270 --> 01:02:42.990
And it's rather an
incongruous time

01:02:42.990 --> 01:02:47.180
to be setting up a
media organization,

01:02:47.180 --> 01:02:50.360
and particularly with
the likes of Google News

01:02:50.360 --> 01:02:52.780
to compete with, for example.

01:02:52.780 --> 01:02:56.480
I wondered if you
could comment on what

01:02:56.480 --> 01:03:06.190
you see as what's necessary in
terms of the evolution of media

01:03:06.190 --> 01:03:10.654
going forward, and how "Fair
Observer" fits into that.

01:03:10.654 --> 01:03:11.570
ATUL SINGH: Thank you.

01:03:11.570 --> 01:03:14.750
Thank you for that question.

01:03:14.750 --> 01:03:16.720
That's an almost
entirely different talk.

01:03:16.720 --> 01:03:19.010
I gave a talk at MIT
earlier this year.

01:03:19.010 --> 01:03:24.900
And that was on the rule of the
fourth estate in the New New

01:03:24.900 --> 01:03:25.710
World.

01:03:25.710 --> 01:03:27.910
And the New New
World is a riff off

01:03:27.910 --> 01:03:29.970
from Michael Lewis's
book about the internet.

01:03:29.970 --> 01:03:33.520
And fourth estate is what
Edmund Burke, an Englishman,

01:03:33.520 --> 01:03:36.790
called the press,
which was sitting

01:03:36.790 --> 01:03:38.920
in the Parliament
for the first time

01:03:38.920 --> 01:03:41.880
and watching the three estates--
the royals, the clergy,

01:03:41.880 --> 01:03:43.140
and the commons.

01:03:43.140 --> 01:03:48.840
And so we have lots of blogs and
lots of noise on the internet.

01:03:48.840 --> 01:03:50.200
That's one.

01:03:50.200 --> 01:03:54.070
And we have huge
media conglomerations,

01:03:54.070 --> 01:03:56.210
which through mergers
and acquisitions

01:03:56.210 --> 01:04:00.550
have become concentrated
in basically

01:04:00.550 --> 01:04:04.550
numbers that you could
count at most on two hands.

01:04:04.550 --> 01:04:07.930
And so, a monopoly of sorts,
or an oligopoly of sorts.

01:04:07.930 --> 01:04:10.760
And the profit-driven
model in the US

01:04:10.760 --> 01:04:14.750
means that everyone's
chasing the headline,

01:04:14.750 --> 01:04:16.580
and you have a
dumbing down of news,

01:04:16.580 --> 01:04:18.190
and attention spans
have gone down.

01:04:18.190 --> 01:04:20.090
And so, discourse has vanished.

01:04:20.090 --> 01:04:23.850
I'm of the firm belief--
not opinion, but belief--

01:04:23.850 --> 01:04:25.710
that democracy needs discourse.

01:04:25.710 --> 01:04:28.500
If you don't have discourse,
you won't have democracy.

01:04:28.500 --> 01:04:31.520
And so why am I setting this up?

01:04:31.520 --> 01:04:33.210
We are a nonprofit for a reason.

01:04:33.210 --> 01:04:37.330
I don't want to be beholden
to a venture capitalist who

01:04:37.330 --> 01:04:38.820
has a target on
my back and says,

01:04:38.820 --> 01:04:43.950
hey, why aren't we at 5
million uniques a month by now?

01:04:43.950 --> 01:04:53.620
So my idea of a media
organization now,

01:04:53.620 --> 01:04:56.740
particularly with the change
in political circumstances,

01:04:56.740 --> 01:04:58.810
is that it has got
to be independent.

01:04:58.810 --> 01:04:59.950
It has got to be fair.

01:04:59.950 --> 01:05:01.290
It has got to be diverse.

01:05:01.290 --> 01:05:02.850
It has got to be truthful.

01:05:02.850 --> 01:05:04.370
It has got to be credible.

01:05:04.370 --> 01:05:13.040
It has got to have this
identity that brings together

01:05:13.040 --> 01:05:14.830
people across cultures.

01:05:14.830 --> 01:05:19.680
And yes, it is hard competing
against Google News.

01:05:19.680 --> 01:05:24.730
Yes, it is hard
targeting people,

01:05:24.730 --> 01:05:27.690
and getting them to read
in-depth about, let's say,

01:05:27.690 --> 01:05:31.800
Turkey, and examine it
historical or philosophically.

01:05:31.800 --> 01:05:34.680
But where I see "Fair
Observer," frankly,

01:05:34.680 --> 01:05:40.310
as this New Age
intelligent readers,

01:05:40.310 --> 01:05:44.130
or intelligent audience's home,
where people are cosmopolitan,

01:05:44.130 --> 01:05:47.670
people have an interest
in issues of importance,

01:05:47.670 --> 01:05:49.830
people are globally
minded, where

01:05:49.830 --> 01:05:54.640
people are willing to question
assumptions, where people want

01:05:54.640 --> 01:05:57.850
to be informed, and educated,
and in turn, informally

01:05:57.850 --> 01:05:59.190
educate others.

01:05:59.190 --> 01:06:04.010
And it is very much in keeping
with the great tradition

01:06:04.010 --> 01:06:06.480
of, let's say, Benjamin Franklin
running his own newspaper,

01:06:06.480 --> 01:06:10.650
or Gandhi running his paper,
or any of the leading lights.

01:06:10.650 --> 01:06:15.260
And the funnel is really wide.

01:06:15.260 --> 01:06:16.750
You can see wild too.

01:06:16.750 --> 01:06:18.620
And the filter is really strong.

01:06:18.620 --> 01:06:21.340
So everything goes through
a quality check, and a fact

01:06:21.340 --> 01:06:22.680
check, and a language check.

01:06:22.680 --> 01:06:27.610
And what we aim to
be is independent.

01:06:27.610 --> 01:06:30.470
And that requires donations
from some of our readers,

01:06:30.470 --> 01:06:31.010
if not all.

01:06:31.010 --> 01:06:34.440
That requires grants from
certain organizations.

01:06:34.440 --> 01:06:36.270
That requires philanthropy.

01:06:36.270 --> 01:06:38.200
That requires
over-time monetizing

01:06:38.200 --> 01:06:42.290
through various
activities, whether it

01:06:42.290 --> 01:06:44.230
is organizing events,
or conferences,

01:06:44.230 --> 01:06:49.140
or selling premium
subscriptions,

01:06:49.140 --> 01:06:52.540
or for that matter,
doing workshops,

01:06:52.540 --> 01:06:54.332
delving into the
education space.

01:06:54.332 --> 01:06:56.040
Because one of the
things that is lacking

01:06:56.040 --> 01:06:59.490
is this civic education--
looking at things in context,

01:06:59.490 --> 01:07:03.170
looking at things across time.

01:07:03.170 --> 01:07:05.210
And that is why one
of the things we do

01:07:05.210 --> 01:07:07.780
is the Voices of the World
Program, where we go and train

01:07:07.780 --> 01:07:10.490
people how to critically,
express themselves

01:07:10.490 --> 01:07:13.670
clearly, and engage with the
great issues of our time.

01:07:13.670 --> 01:07:17.360
And with that, I think I've
come to the end of my time.

01:07:17.360 --> 01:07:18.630
Thank you so, so much.

01:07:18.630 --> 01:07:20.005
You've been a
wonderful audience.

01:07:20.005 --> 01:07:20.830
Thank you.

01:07:20.830 --> 01:07:24.480
[APPLAUSE]
