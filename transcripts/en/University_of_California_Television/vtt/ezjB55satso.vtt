00:00:00.107 --> 00:00:05.107
(swooshing)
(electronic tones)

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:15.270
- We have another advocate,
a legal advocate, Kara Chien,

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.060
who is our next speaker, and Miss Chien,

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:22.323
if you'll come to the podium.

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.710
Kara is the managing attorney
for the Mental Health Unit

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.410
of the Public Defender's
Office of San Francisco,

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.150
so we are delighted to
have her for the first time

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:39.417
at our podium, and I know
you're going to be talking about

00:00:39.417 --> 00:00:43.950
a lot of topics, mental
health issues, legal defense,

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.070
and developmental
disabilities, and bullying,

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.589
and all sorts of things,
so educate us, thank you.

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:51.463
- Thank you, and Jeff says hi.
- Thank you.

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.020
- Good morning, thank you for having me.

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.250
I love to attend medical
conference, even though

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.800
I'm not a doctor, but I
grew up with 12 doctors.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.920
My grandparents, my parents,
my uncles and aunts,

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.410
and each time I attend
(clearing throat) conference,

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:17.410
I always feel very
hopeful, warm and fuzzy,

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.830
because I get to learn all the innovative

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.970
treatment techniques, best practices.

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:27.410
It's very inspiring, but when
I attend legal conference,

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:28.840
it's a little bit, (laughing)
(audience laughing)

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.840
I hate to say it, cold,
hard, impersonal sometimes,

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.123
and we talk about justice, deterrents,

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:43.380
lack of confidentiality,
and really whether you are

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.910
a defendant, an offender, or a victim.

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:51.893
It really puts the person in
a very traumatic position,

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.630
where at the end of that legal experience,

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.045
it's really hard to make them
go back to the status quo.

00:02:00.045 --> 00:02:05.045
I'm gonna share what I know
because that's what I do

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.730
for a living, I represent
clients with mental disorders,

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:11.240
which is the psychiatric...

00:02:13.914 --> 00:02:17.127
Psychiatric diagnosis, or the clients

00:02:17.127 --> 00:02:21.630
with developmental disabilities,
and I also represent

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.629
clients who are in the criminal court

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:27.100
who are found not
competent to stand trial,

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:32.090
who may or may not have
developmental disabilities.

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.640
So, I'm gonna go in and we're gonna

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.980
talk about, first of all, bullying.

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.100
Now, I would like to
have one of the audience.

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.650
Laura, are you here?

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.440
Laura, can you read the
definition of bullying for me?

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.777
Let me see, thank you.
- You're welcome.

00:02:48.777 --> 00:02:50.693
Not sure how to do this.

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:53.670
Hello?
- Okay.

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.660
- [Laura] Bullying,
any severe or pervasive

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.150
physical or verbal acts or conduct,

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.030
including electronic communications
committed by a pupil,

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:09.030
or pupils, that has, or can be,
reasonably predicted to have

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.490
the effect of one or
more of the following:

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:17.970
reasonable fear of harm
to a person or property,

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.500
substantially detrimental effect

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.700
on physical or mental health,
substantial interference

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.240
with academic performance,
substantial interference

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:32.590
with the ability to
participate in or benefit

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:37.170
from school services,
activities, or privileges.

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:38.646
- Thank you, Laura.
- You're welcome.

00:03:38.646 --> 00:03:41.170
- (clapping) Give her a hand.
(audience applauding)

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:43.450
For a non-lawyer, you're
doing a great job,

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.860
so it's a mouthful, just
bullying, you bully someone.

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:50.320
Somebody got upset as a result
of just the act of bullying,

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:54.450
the bullying act, that's it,
but this is the definition,

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.147
and we have to break it down.

00:03:56.147 --> 00:03:59.350
I share with you because this is codified

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:04.350
in the California Education
Code, and also, this is posted

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:08.040
in San Francisco Unified School District.

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:12.070
So, I saw some of the
attendees' name cards.

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:14.910
I know you're not from California,

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:18.170
or may be from another county,
so welcome to San Francisco.

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:22.490
So, it's always a good idea
to go to your local area

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:25.350
to look up your unified school district,

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:27.420
what are their policies,
what are their rules,

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:29.337
what are their definitions?

00:04:29.337 --> 00:04:34.337
So, even in California,
it's very county specific.

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:39.551
So, in San Francisco, if
you go on their website,

00:04:39.551 --> 00:04:43.780
they will define different
types of bullying,

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:47.024
and I don't see it in
Alameda County website.

00:04:47.024 --> 00:04:51.970
In San Francisco, they
mention cyberbullying,

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:55.030
which is very, we read
about it all the time,

00:04:55.030 --> 00:05:00.030
Facebook, through social
media, of text, an image,

00:05:01.356 --> 00:05:06.356
a sound or a video, that
counts cyberbullying,

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:10.600
if that triggers upset on
the person who's receiving

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:14.270
the message, and the verbal
bullying, that's very obvious.

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:18.480
Physical bullying, it's
act of fighting or hitting.

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:22.163
Social or relational bullying,
and that's kind of like

00:05:22.163 --> 00:05:26.000
people have a clique and
try to be exclusionary,

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.180
excluding someone into that social group.

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:33.210
That act is also considered bullying.

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:37.163
Non-verbal bullying is a
gesture, staring, stalking,

00:05:38.186 --> 00:05:43.186
and destruction of property,
so it's not a verbal,

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:49.530
not a physical, but it's
something that kind of latent.

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:51.270
It's kind of difficult to detect.

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:53.770
The last one is indirect bullying.

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:57.780
It's intimidating or
peer pressure on someone

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:02.583
to cause harm to a third party,
so it's indirect bullying.

00:06:06.813 --> 00:06:11.750
If my child goes to school
and someone bullies her.

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:13.986
She comes home really
upset, and this child

00:06:13.986 --> 00:06:18.163
cut in front of me, we were
standing in the cafeteria.

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:19.853
Is that bullying?

00:06:19.853 --> 00:06:24.120
Well, that's a rude behavior,
so we need to sort of

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:26.860
pay attention when we get the message,

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:29.890
when we want to make that
report of that incident,

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:33.240
we need to think about it,
and organize our facts.

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:36.150
So, if it was just one isolative incident,

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:40.265
if the incident is done
unintentionally to cause someone

00:06:40.265 --> 00:06:45.265
else to be upset, such
as saying oh I'm great

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:48.550
and you're not smart
'cause I got an A today.

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:50.550
So, that may not be constituted bullying.

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:53.260
That may be just somebody
being inconsiderate.

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:58.160
So, what we look for is those
conduct that is a pattern.

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:00.756
Yesterday he said this, today he did this,

00:07:00.756 --> 00:07:03.180
and in the afternoon
he said the same thing.

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:06.650
So, when you make your
reporting, then people will

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:10.977
pay attention, not just one
isolative incident, so that's--

00:07:10.977 --> 00:07:14.020
- Speak a little more in
here so the overflow room

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:15.840
can hear you, thank you so much.

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:17.985
- Sorry. (laughing)
- No problem.

00:07:17.985 --> 00:07:19.960
(audience laughing)
- Alright.

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:22.469
- Was that bullying?
- (laughing) No!

00:07:22.469 --> 00:07:26.000
That was a very helpful hint.
(laughing with audience)

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.240
See, that's, so we need
to, it's really hard

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:33.422
when it's my child and
when it's the victim.

00:07:33.422 --> 00:07:37.070
So, when we go to the
school board, when we go

00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:40.500
to the teacher, we make the
reporting, write it down.

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:45.430
Documentation is very
important, and especially

00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:51.870
clients, or patients, or your
loved one, who is non-verbal,

00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:55.410
and who is constantly being picked on,

00:07:55.410 --> 00:07:58.820
someone who's really
bad, and there's nobody

00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:03.820
to defend this child, and
this child cannot express

00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:07.020
how she feels, but you
know that she's upset.

00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:11.133
You know her daily routine has changed.

00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:16.655
My daughter studies
cognitive behavioral science,

00:08:16.655 --> 00:08:20.470
and she wants to use our therapy to help

00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:23.920
with trauma victims, so
having a piece of paper,

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:27.100
say draw what happened,
tell me how you feel,

00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:31.909
that's important, or if we're very lucky,

00:08:31.909 --> 00:08:36.909
we ask questions around our
child's friends, peer provider,

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.610
see if there's a third party
witness who saw the incident.

00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:45.620
That will be very
powerful, so documentation,

00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:48.590
searching for third party witness,

00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:51.240
and then make your report,
and in San Francisco,

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:53.190
once you make your
report, they have two days

00:08:53.190 --> 00:08:56.960
to ask you to file a complaint,
and they will investigate,

00:08:56.960 --> 00:09:01.620
and they will do a
resolution of the complaint,

00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:06.620
and that, sometimes, in San
Francisco, it's counseling,

00:09:10.377 --> 00:09:15.377
therapy, behavioral
modification of the wrongdoer.

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:22.040
For severe and pervasive
bullying that triggers

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:26.717
a lot of harm, then that
student may face expulsion,

00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:34.130
or suspension, and if that
comes, if your loved one

00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:36.750
is the offender, you can contact

00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:38.830
the San Francisco Public Defender's Office

00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:41.340
or your local public defender's office.

00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:44.793
They may have a juvenile
unit, and the juvenile unit,

00:09:44.793 --> 00:09:49.110
they have an educational
expert who goes to the school,

00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:51.950
or maybe advise the family how to do

00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:55.079
these administrative hearings
so you can prevent your child

00:09:55.079 --> 00:09:58.240
to reduce from expulsion to a suspension.

00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:01.530
Maybe a suspension to something
a little bit more be not

00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:05.409
because if my child has special needs,

00:10:05.409 --> 00:10:09.131
I need to let them know,
and they should not penalize

00:10:09.131 --> 00:10:14.131
like a child who is
without the special needs.

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:16.590
So, they need to take
those mitigating factors

00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:19.123
into consideration, so
that's very important.

00:10:20.782 --> 00:10:25.539
And, if there is no
criminal code that says

00:10:25.539 --> 00:10:30.460
if you commit a bullying act,
you're gonna be prosecuted.

00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:33.900
So, the act of bullying,
depending on how it's done,

00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:36.350
for example, I'm gonna kill you,

00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:39.328
I'm threatening to kill you,
or actually hit somebody.

00:10:39.328 --> 00:10:44.020
If it's serious enough,
if there's a physical,

00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:47.883
like bite mark, or if there is,

00:10:51.113 --> 00:10:54.143
like cutting that requires suturing,

00:10:55.520 --> 00:11:00.410
then the report will
escalate to be San Francisco

00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:03.500
Police Department, or to
the local police department

00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:07.053
for an incident report,
and they can file charges,

00:11:08.970 --> 00:11:13.050
excuse me, against the
individual who committed the act.

00:11:13.050 --> 00:11:18.050
So, it could be an assault,
battery, or terrorist threat,

00:11:18.444 --> 00:11:23.444
or hate crime, so if that does happen,

00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:29.390
if your loved one, or your
patient, or your client is a

00:11:29.390 --> 00:11:34.390
(clearing throat) victim,
then it's best to contact

00:11:34.990 --> 00:11:39.402
a local district attorney's
office to make sure that

00:11:39.402 --> 00:11:42.400
(item dropping loudly)
the, that's okay,

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:47.400
the individual gets support
from the, oh thank you,

00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:51.540
I'm sorry, thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

00:11:52.930 --> 00:11:56.110
- Make sure the individual
gets support from the

00:11:58.950 --> 00:12:02.470
victim services and advocacy unit.

00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:04.920
So, when I contact their office and I say

00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:07.010
what kind of services you can offer?

00:12:07.010 --> 00:12:10.280
Well, we will pay for the
mental health counseling,

00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:14.270
we will pay for relocation,
we will pay for, sometimes,

00:12:14.270 --> 00:12:18.850
vicarious victims, the family
members are also traumatized,

00:12:18.850 --> 00:12:20.957
so they will give support.

00:12:20.957 --> 00:12:24.760
For example, if the regional
center, through Medical,

00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:28.490
pays for the counseling, but
if you have to pay anything

00:12:28.490 --> 00:12:31.099
out of pocket, you can
submit the bill and say

00:12:31.099 --> 00:12:36.099
please reimburse me, and
also for victims if they are

00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:40.340
uncomfortable testifying in a courtroom,

00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:42.996
they have therapy dog
to assist the victim,

00:12:42.996 --> 00:12:46.030
to feel more comfortable
so they can testify,

00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:48.850
just to calm down their
nerves a little bit.

00:12:48.850 --> 00:12:52.193
So, that's from a victim perspective.

00:12:54.492 --> 00:12:59.154
If the victim,
unfortunately, is non-verbal

00:12:59.154 --> 00:13:04.154
or have a lot of difficulty
expressing his or herself,

00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:07.550
it's very important to
contact the provider

00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:12.550
and let the district attorney's
office is the victim service

00:13:14.390 --> 00:13:19.390
case worker, that probably
he or she needs trauma

00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:27.080
inform approach to help
her through the case

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:31.350
during litigation, and use
trauma specific intervention

00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:36.350
so the victim will not
be impacted, and scared,

00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:40.163
and feel stress during
the pendency of the case.

00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:46.910
In the unfortunate event, if
the person is being charged

00:13:46.910 --> 00:13:48.560
for a crime as a result of bullying

00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:53.560
or other serious criminal
offense, please don't be afraid,

00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:00.390
and it's always, just take a deep breath.

00:14:00.390 --> 00:14:05.203
How many of us, in our car,
we have an emergency kit?

00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:07.570
Can you raise your hand?

00:14:07.570 --> 00:14:12.570
Yes, so if your child, your
client, or your patient

00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:20.800
has developmental disabilities,
it's very important

00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:25.070
to have a fact sheet,
the name, the provider,

00:14:25.070 --> 00:14:29.230
the case worker, medication,
what are the triggers,

00:14:29.230 --> 00:14:31.330
what are the things that
calm him or her down,

00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:34.560
what are the things
that this person needs?

00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:38.510
And if, in the unfortunate
event, my client,

00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:42.630
at the time of the arrest,
it's very important

00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:46.340
for the family to come
forward and fax that letter

00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:48.900
to the attorney, or fax
the letter to the people

00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:52.230
who are in charge of the
investigation of the case.

00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:55.510
And, in San Francisco, we
have two pilot projects.

00:14:55.510 --> 00:14:59.470
One is called Law Enforcement
Assisted Diversion.

00:14:59.470 --> 00:15:02.350
So, let's say the case,
it's being reported

00:15:02.350 --> 00:15:04.880
to the school district,
it's pretty serious,

00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:06.410
but this is the first time.

00:15:06.410 --> 00:15:08.500
So, when the police come to the school

00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:11.060
and gather information and they say, well,

00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:15.040
it's a very low level criminal
activity, it's upsetting,

00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:17.380
but we're gonna give this person a chance.

00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:20.980
They will not be booked,
and they will be diverted

00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:24.330
in the community to do
therapy, counseling,

00:15:24.330 --> 00:15:27.537
or community service work,
and after a period of time,

00:15:27.537 --> 00:15:32.537
and there is no recidivism,
no re-offending,

00:15:32.710 --> 00:15:35.220
then they will let this case go,

00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:37.940
so that's one of the legal remedies.

00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:41.690
The second one, it's called
Pre-arraignment Release Unit,

00:15:41.690 --> 00:15:46.180
PRU, it started last October,
and when people are booked

00:15:46.180 --> 00:15:49.630
in the county jail,
public defender's office,

00:15:49.630 --> 00:15:52.400
we have two attorneys
and one investigator,

00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:55.163
we will interview the client,
review the discoveries.

00:15:56.340 --> 00:15:58.570
When we say discoveries, police report,

00:15:58.570 --> 00:16:02.230
chronology investigation, as
much as we can get within hours

00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:05.740
of their booking, we try to
take photos if our clients

00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:08.340
are being beaten, so we'll
preserve the evidence,

00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:10.870
and then we will try to
get the clients released

00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:14.770
before their court date, so
shorten their stay in custody,

00:16:14.770 --> 00:16:19.770
and that will definitely really
help to not have our clients

00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:22.690
with special needs being
traumatized in such

00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:27.690
a horrific setting, and if the
person does not get released,

00:16:28.530 --> 00:16:31.640
sometimes maybe the charges are serious,

00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:36.003
or maybe the victim's family
are pressuring prosecution.

00:16:37.470 --> 00:16:42.470
We also have a bail unit
that will file bail motions

00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:45.250
to try to reduce the bail.

00:16:45.250 --> 00:16:47.680
A judge should not set
a bail that is so high

00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:50.720
somebody could not afford
it, so it is a big thing

00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:53.930
in California right
now, it's a bail reform,

00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:58.300
so that would help the client to post bail

00:17:00.524 --> 00:17:03.610
if it's affordable so
they can litigate the case

00:17:03.610 --> 00:17:07.350
and out of custody, and
allow the client to reconnect

00:17:07.350 --> 00:17:09.988
with the provider, get
treatment, get counseling

00:17:09.988 --> 00:17:13.130
while the case is pending, so that's,

00:17:13.130 --> 00:17:15.710
it's very important because
it reduces the stress

00:17:15.710 --> 00:17:18.188
of the clients, and also
it helps the attorney

00:17:18.188 --> 00:17:22.190
to connect with the
client's support circle

00:17:22.190 --> 00:17:24.387
so we can figure out a defense.

00:17:24.387 --> 00:17:27.650
If the case goes to court,
and if we have gathered

00:17:27.650 --> 00:17:30.840
enough information,
and convinced the judge

00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:34.100
to allow the client to,
what we call diversion,

00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:36.735
it's kinda similar to the Law Enforcement

00:17:36.735 --> 00:17:39.750
Assisted Diversion, but
this is already booking,

00:17:39.750 --> 00:17:43.327
and formal complaint has been
filed, and allow the client

00:17:43.327 --> 00:17:48.229
to do therapy, to do community
service work, and also

00:17:48.229 --> 00:17:52.090
our San Francisco District
Attorney likes to do

00:17:52.090 --> 00:17:55.657
restorative justice, so
maybe everybody sit down,

00:17:55.657 --> 00:17:58.610
the offender apologizes to the victim,

00:17:58.610 --> 00:18:02.557
and the victim accepts the
apology, or if they destroy

00:18:02.557 --> 00:18:05.580
some property, they
will repay the property,

00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:07.406
and afterwards, everybody shakes hands

00:18:07.406 --> 00:18:10.790
and have a nice closure, and
the case will be dismissed.

00:18:10.790 --> 00:18:14.918
So sometimes, that kind
of outcome could happen,

00:18:14.918 --> 00:18:19.525
but if the case is so serious
and it's not going anywhere,

00:18:19.525 --> 00:18:23.085
it's not resolving right
away with dismissal,

00:18:23.085 --> 00:18:26.210
San Francisco has collaborative courts.

00:18:26.210 --> 00:18:30.220
People with mental illness,
psychiatric mental illness,

00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:34.130
or developmental disabilities,
or sometimes people

00:18:34.130 --> 00:18:39.130
who are veterans, who have a
history of substance abuse,

00:18:39.358 --> 00:18:40.920
we have different courts.

00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:43.423
We have drug court, veteran's court,

00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:46.110
behavioral health court, misdemeanor

00:18:46.110 --> 00:18:50.230
behavioral health court,
and also youth court,

00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:52.580
transitional youth age court.

00:18:52.580 --> 00:18:56.700
It depends on the offense and
their eligibility criteria.

00:18:56.700 --> 00:19:01.250
Basically, we try to use the
judge's black robe effect

00:19:01.250 --> 00:19:04.590
to encourage compliance with treatment,

00:19:04.590 --> 00:19:08.037
and hopefully after a period
of time, when the client

00:19:08.037 --> 00:19:13.037
demonstrates ability to
engage, and there are no

00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:16.740
re-offending incidents that
they would dismiss the case,

00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:20.170
or they will reduce from
a felony to a misdemeanor,

00:19:20.170 --> 00:19:23.080
or they will reduce the
time of being on probation,

00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:26.240
so the client can become reintegrated back

00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:28.690
to the community without having to worry,

00:19:28.690 --> 00:19:31.853
I have this criminal case hanging around.

00:19:36.469 --> 00:19:41.469
Sometimes, at this stage, a
lot of family members call me.

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:47.200
Anxious mom, loving sisters,
or loving father or brother.

00:19:49.066 --> 00:19:51.590
I wanna know what's going on with my son.

00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:53.550
What's happening with the case?

00:19:53.550 --> 00:19:55.410
And I said, I can't talk
to you, I don't have

00:19:55.410 --> 00:19:57.630
a release of information. (laughing)

00:19:57.630 --> 00:20:00.010
If it's a minor, then I
can talk to the parents,

00:20:00.010 --> 00:20:02.310
but if it's an adult, it's difficult.

00:20:02.310 --> 00:20:05.720
So, how do we get at least
our foot into the door?

00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:09.082
How do we at least get
to share information?

00:20:09.082 --> 00:20:12.638
Remember, I mentioned the
fact sheet, so you can always

00:20:12.638 --> 00:20:15.630
send me a fact sheet, you
can always talk to me.

00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:18.040
I don't wanna be rude, but I
won't be able to talk to you

00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:21.915
and discuss the case in
detail, but there is a way.

00:20:21.915 --> 00:20:26.390
I think it's good to have
something to allow you

00:20:26.390 --> 00:20:30.790
to have a seat at the table,
and that will be my suggestion

00:20:30.790 --> 00:20:33.360
is the limited probate conservatorship.

00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:37.165
So what a limited probate
conservatorship does in California

00:20:37.165 --> 00:20:40.320
is to give a responsible person, generally

00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:44.400
it's a family member, as
a limited conservator,

00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:46.990
certain rights to care for another adult

00:20:46.990 --> 00:20:51.990
who has a developmental
disability, and who is eligible?

00:20:53.460 --> 00:20:57.060
I believe that the regional
center can make the assessment,

00:20:57.060 --> 00:21:00.240
and you use the assessment
to file the paperwork.

00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:02.670
You don't need a lawyer, you
can go to the help center

00:21:02.670 --> 00:21:06.656
in the courthouse to try to
get the form and fill it out.

00:21:06.656 --> 00:21:11.150
The powers of the limited
conservator is quite extensive.

00:21:11.150 --> 00:21:14.570
You can look at the confidential paper

00:21:14.570 --> 00:21:17.100
of the adult's confidential paper.

00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:20.730
You can decide where the adult lives.

00:21:20.730 --> 00:21:23.350
You can give or withhold
consent for most of

00:21:23.350 --> 00:21:26.380
the medical treatments,
and you can make decisions

00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:29.963
about the adult's education
and vocational training.

00:21:29.963 --> 00:21:32.820
You can even make decision
whether or not to place the adult

00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:37.728
in a state hospital, a
developmental center for treatment,

00:21:37.728 --> 00:21:42.080
and give and withhold consent
to the adult's marriage.

00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:44.640
That's (laughing), and it's
a little bit difficult.

00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:49.640
I think the law kinda said that
if the adult with disability

00:21:49.870 --> 00:21:53.470
is in danger in a relationship,

00:21:53.470 --> 00:21:55.983
then the limited conservator can step in.

00:21:57.230 --> 00:22:02.230
So, it has a lot of power,
but I have to tell you,

00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:05.300
in San Francisco, I checked
with the public guardian,

00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:09.220
we don't have limited
probate conservatorship.

00:22:09.220 --> 00:22:12.310
We use general probate conservatorship

00:22:12.310 --> 00:22:16.283
to give the conservator
that power, yes, yes?

00:22:18.381 --> 00:22:23.381
(woman murmuring)
It's not mental health.

00:22:24.050 --> 00:22:26.260
Mental health conservatorship is under

00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:28.972
the Lanterman-Petris-Short
Act, which is not covered

00:22:28.972 --> 00:22:33.260
on today's topic, but I can
talk about a story at the end.

00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:35.496
I'll share with you how
to transition somebody

00:22:35.496 --> 00:22:39.240
from mental health to
developmental, but this only

00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:43.210
for an adult with
developmental disability,

00:22:43.210 --> 00:22:47.200
but in San Francisco, I have,
although that's not the area

00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:50.820
of my practice, but I do know that adults

00:22:50.820 --> 00:22:54.530
with developmental disability,
they have a conservator,

00:22:54.530 --> 00:22:56.780
and as a general probate conservatorship.

00:22:56.780 --> 00:22:59.000
It's not a mental health conservatorship.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:00.633
Thank you for the clarification.

00:23:04.169 --> 00:23:07.520
So, with that piece of
paper from the court,

00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:10.770
certainly would allow the
public defender to talk to you,

00:23:10.770 --> 00:23:12.793
or the defense attorney to talk to you.

00:23:14.470 --> 00:23:18.950
The limited public conservator
could get compensation

00:23:18.950 --> 00:23:22.009
from the state of the conservatee.

00:23:22.009 --> 00:23:25.410
You will be under supervision
for the first year.

00:23:25.410 --> 00:23:27.720
Someone from the court
will review the case,

00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:32.600
and then they will review
once every two years,

00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:36.310
and the liabilities is only
if the limited conservator

00:23:36.310 --> 00:23:38.950
is negligent, like embezzling money,

00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:41.110
doing something that's inappropriate,

00:23:41.110 --> 00:23:44.250
and you really don't
need legal representation

00:23:44.250 --> 00:23:47.350
to file the paper, so that's
a good tool, at least,

00:23:47.350 --> 00:23:51.500
to get you, legitimize your
ability to talk to someone

00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:55.023
and be helpful in the process.

00:23:56.050 --> 00:24:00.175
If the case kind of comes in, the client,

00:24:00.175 --> 00:24:05.030
the adult with developmental
disability is unable

00:24:05.030 --> 00:24:08.760
to understand the criminal
proceeding and is not able

00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:12.460
to take advantage of the
resolution that I mentioned before,

00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:15.460
the possibility of
diversion, getting dismissed,

00:24:15.460 --> 00:24:17.730
getting them out of jail, and figure out

00:24:17.730 --> 00:24:21.693
what the legal remedies
while they're out of custody.

00:24:22.820 --> 00:24:26.830
Sometimes, I even have a client who has

00:24:26.830 --> 00:24:29.416
two misdemeanor cases in San Francisco,

00:24:29.416 --> 00:24:32.740
one in another county, actually, was found

00:24:32.740 --> 00:24:34.790
not competent to stand trial.

00:24:34.790 --> 00:24:37.530
He is working with a regional center

00:24:37.530 --> 00:24:41.690
in the state of California,
and so what constitutes

00:24:43.950 --> 00:24:48.170
incompetent to stand trial is
the inability to understand

00:24:48.170 --> 00:24:51.300
the nature and purpose of
the criminal proceedings

00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:55.780
pending against him or her,
understand his or her own status

00:24:55.780 --> 00:24:58.490
and condition in the criminal proceedings,

00:24:58.490 --> 00:25:02.700
and assist, in a rational
manner, his or her attorney

00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:05.170
in representing his or her case.

00:25:05.170 --> 00:25:08.180
So, usually when the doubt is raised,

00:25:08.180 --> 00:25:10.530
the judge will suspend
the criminal proceedings

00:25:12.110 --> 00:25:17.110
against the client, and
what would happen is that,

00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:22.240
the client willing not be
prosecute, and will be asked

00:25:24.690 --> 00:25:29.690
to be examined by a court
appointed alienist expert.

00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:33.030
So, if I know my client,
which is the fact sheet,

00:25:33.030 --> 00:25:34.880
it's helpful that I know my client has

00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:38.260
developmental disability, I
will try to ask the court,

00:25:38.260 --> 00:25:40.850
we would need to get an
expert that's in that field

00:25:40.850 --> 00:25:44.740
of specialty so the assessment
will be more accurate,

00:25:44.740 --> 00:25:49.663
will be more helpful, and what
the alienist will look at is

00:25:55.210 --> 00:25:59.610
full capacities, factual
understanding of the proceeding,

00:25:59.610 --> 00:26:01.720
rational understanding of the proceeding,

00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:03.460
ability to consult with attorney

00:26:03.460 --> 00:26:06.440
with reasonable degree of
rational understanding,

00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:10.380
and ability to assist counsel
in preparing a defense.

00:26:10.380 --> 00:26:12.810
Those are pretty daunting tasks.

00:26:12.810 --> 00:26:15.900
Even my clients without special needs

00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:18.050
still get very stressed, distressed,

00:26:18.050 --> 00:26:20.690
and we have to hold their hands.

00:26:20.690 --> 00:26:23.173
They also look at decisional capacity,

00:26:24.060 --> 00:26:26.920
which, whether to put on a defense,

00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:29.210
raise one or more affirmative defenses.

00:26:29.210 --> 00:26:31.009
Affirmative defense is like when,

00:26:31.009 --> 00:26:35.410
the reason I hit somebody is
because I'm protecting my life.

00:26:35.410 --> 00:26:37.296
That's affirmative defense.

00:26:37.296 --> 00:26:39.750
Waiving the right to a
jury trial, to decide

00:26:39.750 --> 00:26:44.750
whether or not a judge will
be a better trier of facts,

00:26:45.170 --> 00:26:48.455
will be just determining the
facts, or to have 12 people

00:26:48.455 --> 00:26:51.015
that never met you before
and come and make a decision

00:26:51.015 --> 00:26:54.474
about your fate, so to speak.

00:26:54.474 --> 00:26:57.359
Whether or not to take
the stand as a witness,

00:26:57.359 --> 00:27:01.770
is my client able to take the pressure?

00:27:01.770 --> 00:27:04.240
Waive the privilege
against self-incrimination,

00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:07.846
giving statements, decline
to confront witnesses.

00:27:07.846 --> 00:27:12.477
So, in cases where the
defendant is non-verbal,

00:27:12.477 --> 00:27:15.036
or when the victim is non-verbal,

00:27:15.036 --> 00:27:18.510
the right to confront
witnesses is a big part.

00:27:18.510 --> 00:27:20.940
That's why if neither party could do this,

00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:23.360
they have to suspend
a criminal proceeding.

00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:26.960
It's a violation of
their due process rights

00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:29.910
if you continue to prosecute
someone who's not able

00:27:29.910 --> 00:27:34.910
to defend him or herself,
and in this type of situation

00:27:35.386 --> 00:27:37.350
that I mentioned, one of my clients has

00:27:37.350 --> 00:27:39.940
two misdemeanor cases
in San Francisco County,

00:27:39.940 --> 00:27:44.326
one in another county, we were
able to convince the judge

00:27:44.326 --> 00:27:48.990
not to remand him in
custody, and allow him to do

00:27:48.990 --> 00:27:52.680
the program in the community,
and we did a lot of work.

00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:55.290
We map his schedule throughout the week,

00:27:55.290 --> 00:27:58.050
make sure that he has
supervision throughout the week,

00:27:58.050 --> 00:28:00.500
and there are caseworkers following him,

00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:05.500
and he comes to court,
maybe once every two months,

00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:09.770
and within six months or so,
if he completed his treatment,

00:28:09.770 --> 00:28:13.020
completed his treatment plan,
he did not pick up a case,

00:28:13.020 --> 00:28:15.020
those cases would be dismissed.

00:28:15.020 --> 00:28:18.640
So, it's doable, but it
takes time, and that's why

00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:20.340
I always go back to that fact sheet.

00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:21.913
It's very, very important.

00:28:28.166 --> 00:28:31.761
It would not be complete for talking about

00:28:31.761 --> 00:28:36.090
mental health issues and legal defense for

00:28:36.090 --> 00:28:40.050
developmentally disabled
individuals without mention,

00:28:40.050 --> 00:28:41.500
which I don't like to talk about,

00:28:41.500 --> 00:28:45.013
is the Welfare Institution's Code 6500.

00:28:45.940 --> 00:28:50.620
I don't do a lot of these
cases, maybe one or two a year

00:28:50.620 --> 00:28:53.250
in San Francisco, it's rarely filed,

00:28:53.250 --> 00:28:56.970
and the law has changed since 2012,

00:28:56.970 --> 00:29:00.476
so the commitment is not
lengthy and indefinite,

00:29:00.476 --> 00:29:04.440
so there are two types after 2012.

00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:10.710
One is based on dangerous
criteria, and that is

00:29:10.710 --> 00:29:15.710
for someone who has committed
a crime and is not competent

00:29:16.250 --> 00:29:18.254
to stand trial, so I
have one case, which is,

00:29:18.254 --> 00:29:21.170
the person committed a murder 187,

00:29:21.170 --> 00:29:24.174
so this person is committed under 6500,

00:29:24.174 --> 00:29:27.190
and it used to be, I will
continue to follow the case

00:29:27.190 --> 00:29:29.570
every year for extension
of the commitment,

00:29:29.570 --> 00:29:31.990
and now it's done in Tulare County.

00:29:31.990 --> 00:29:35.060
So, Tulare County's
Public Defender's Office

00:29:35.060 --> 00:29:37.740
will be following that commitment.

00:29:37.740 --> 00:29:40.810
The other one is a civil
commitment, when someone is in

00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:46.330
acute crisis, and the
need to be committed,

00:29:46.330 --> 00:29:48.310
and it's very rare.

00:29:48.310 --> 00:29:52.910
It only happens when, once
in a while, our clients are

00:29:52.910 --> 00:29:56.210
in the home and is becoming 17 and-a-half

00:29:56.210 --> 00:29:59.460
and he needs to go to adult
facility while we're waiting.

00:29:59.460 --> 00:30:03.740
The licensing and all the things
required is to have a 6500,

00:30:03.740 --> 00:30:06.252
just like a placeholder until this person

00:30:06.252 --> 00:30:10.119
is safely transitioned into a home,

00:30:10.119 --> 00:30:13.990
and then I will make sure
the commitment is terminated.

00:30:13.990 --> 00:30:17.750
So, it doesn't go, it used to
be every year is renewable.

00:30:17.750 --> 00:30:21.110
Now, it's 180 days, and
then they will only give you

00:30:21.110 --> 00:30:23.460
another 90 day, the court
will only allow to give

00:30:23.460 --> 00:30:25.880
another 90 days extend to make sure

00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:28.890
the transitional placement has completed,

00:30:28.890 --> 00:30:32.880
the individual is no longer
in acute crisis mode,

00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:35.683
and they can safely live in the community.

00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:39.213
In closing, I just wanted to share,

00:30:40.725 --> 00:30:45.725
I started working in the mental
health unit in the year 2000

00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:51.200
and to me, developmental
disability was really

00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:53.646
a foreign language to me, and in court,

00:30:53.646 --> 00:30:57.790
we don't use intellectual
disability, we don't use

00:30:57.790 --> 00:31:00.950
cognitive disability, or
developmental disability.

00:31:00.950 --> 00:31:04.160
We just use one term along,
a lump, just uncompressed

00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:07.247
for the whole thing, and
sometimes some attorney will say,

00:31:07.247 --> 00:31:09.460
"My client has a mental health issue."

00:31:09.460 --> 00:31:12.910
And then, it turns out it's
developmental disability.

00:31:12.910 --> 00:31:17.910
It's not psychiatric, so if
we know, if we are providers,

00:31:18.250 --> 00:31:20.313
take the time and explain the difference.

00:31:21.520 --> 00:31:24.050
I think the person who
gets the information

00:31:24.050 --> 00:31:26.220
would appreciate it 'cause
there's really, for me

00:31:26.220 --> 00:31:29.310
who's been doing it for
a while, it's really

00:31:29.310 --> 00:31:31.820
sounding like, okay, let's go back

00:31:31.820 --> 00:31:35.070
and let's distinguish if
they are very different.

00:31:35.070 --> 00:31:40.070
So, I have a client who
was born deaf and mute,

00:31:42.010 --> 00:31:43.840
and he has an adoptive parents.

00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:46.550
The father is a sign language interpreter,

00:31:46.550 --> 00:31:51.550
the mother is a writer, and
he was found to be unable to

00:31:53.990 --> 00:31:57.150
live in the community, he was
placed in Napa State Hospital.

00:31:57.150 --> 00:32:00.290
At that time, there was a deaf unit,

00:32:00.290 --> 00:32:05.290
people with hearing impair,
so by the year of 2006 and 7,

00:32:07.750 --> 00:32:10.487
Napa State Hospital said,
"We no longer want to renew

00:32:10.487 --> 00:32:13.447
"his conservatorship, I don't
care, you're gonna put him

00:32:13.447 --> 00:32:15.440
"on the street, but we don't want him."

00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:18.620
Because they no longer have
a deaf unit, and thank God

00:32:18.620 --> 00:32:23.030
the adoptive parents was
very good record keeper.

00:32:23.030 --> 00:32:28.030
They found something years
before that, like five years old,

00:32:28.950 --> 00:32:31.840
right after he was born,
there was assessment

00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:34.870
by the regional centers
saying that he has autism.

00:32:34.870 --> 00:32:37.802
Ah-ha, so we said, well let's
talk to the regional center.

00:32:37.802 --> 00:32:41.160
But, because my client
had a history of put out,

00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:43.790
15 staff member out of commission,

00:32:43.790 --> 00:32:48.790
nobody wants to touch him
(sighing) so it took me two years.

00:32:49.270 --> 00:32:53.100
I bring regional center
lawyer, regional center

00:32:53.100 --> 00:32:56.400
social worker, I bring
the mental health people,

00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:59.850
the conservator, two
years, every other week

00:32:59.850 --> 00:33:01.040
I want them to come to court,

00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:02.290
so what are you gonna do for my client?

00:33:02.290 --> 00:33:04.000
He needs a place to stay.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.840
I know that if I'm greedy,
I ask for a whole pie,

00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:09.790
I'm not gonna get it, so
thank God I'm Chinese,

00:33:09.790 --> 00:33:12.008
I'm a good bargain person, so I ask--

00:33:12.008 --> 00:33:15.210
(audience laughing)
I ask one slice of the pie

00:33:15.210 --> 00:33:18.450
at the time, and I said look,
he's in wrist restraints

00:33:18.450 --> 00:33:22.900
75% of the time, what can
you do as a regional center

00:33:22.900 --> 00:33:26.680
if you cannot provide a
placement, what services

00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:31.210
can you provide in Napa to
augment it so we can reduce

00:33:31.210 --> 00:33:35.540
his quality of having to
be in wrist restraint,

00:33:35.540 --> 00:33:39.320
the length of time, and to
improve his quality of life?

00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:43.612
So, they brought into assess
person to work with him,

00:33:43.612 --> 00:33:46.230
and then somehow miracle happened.

00:33:46.230 --> 00:33:48.447
These two people said,
"Napa State Hospital

00:33:48.447 --> 00:33:50.750
"is not the appropriate
placement for him."

00:33:50.750 --> 00:33:53.496
I said, "Ah-ha, okay, so let's
look for one." (laughing)

00:33:53.496 --> 00:33:56.170
(audience laughing)
So, every two weeks,

00:33:56.170 --> 00:33:59.150
we come back, so have you
seen one, Sierra Vista,

00:33:59.150 --> 00:34:01.940
this place turned him down,
that place turned him down,

00:34:01.940 --> 00:34:04.106
then we found Porterville, said,
"I don't like Porterville."

00:34:04.106 --> 00:34:04.939
I said, "Where is Porterville?"

00:34:04.939 --> 00:34:08.710
So, I looked at the map, so far
away, and his adopted mother

00:34:08.710 --> 00:34:13.210
has industrial allergies, she
can't go to certain place,

00:34:13.210 --> 00:34:16.500
so she was like, "I can't go
there, I may have allergy."

00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:20.640
So, we worked with the client, and finally

00:34:20.640 --> 00:34:23.550
they got him a bed space at Porterville.

00:34:23.550 --> 00:34:28.300
So, when he went there, I was
very scared because everybody,

00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:30.690
I think the staff from
Porterville had to go to Napa

00:34:30.690 --> 00:34:33.300
to learn about his sign language.

00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:36.358
His sign language is not the
conventional sign language.

00:34:36.358 --> 00:34:38.820
It's something he make
up, and only the people

00:34:38.820 --> 00:34:41.360
that work with him knows
what he meant by doing

00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:44.184
this and that, and so they
learned that and they did

00:34:44.184 --> 00:34:46.760
really have a thoughtful transition team,

00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:49.936
and so it helps to be persistent
and be a pain in the butt.

00:34:49.936 --> 00:34:51.960
(laughing) So, coming to court every

00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:53.625
other week 'til they make the report.

00:34:53.625 --> 00:34:57.450
Finally, he went to
Porterville, and I learned that

00:34:57.450 --> 00:35:00.203
the treatment modality
is different from Napa,

00:35:00.203 --> 00:35:03.591
and so I really wanted
to know how he's doing

00:35:03.591 --> 00:35:06.540
because we'd been working
with him for so many years.

00:35:06.540 --> 00:35:08.100
So, one day I went to Porterville.

00:35:08.100 --> 00:35:11.979
I went to the unit to visit
him, and I saw this man sitting,

00:35:11.979 --> 00:35:14.840
his back turned towards me,
he was sitting at a table

00:35:14.840 --> 00:35:17.300
having lunch with three other people.

00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:19.460
He's not in restraints, wrist restraints.

00:35:19.460 --> 00:35:22.860
He was walking around freely,
and then his staff told me,

00:35:22.860 --> 00:35:23.957
he said, "He goes to a party.

00:35:23.957 --> 00:35:26.784
"He even has a girlfriend,
too." (laughing)

00:35:26.784 --> 00:35:27.920
- [Audience] Aww.

00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:30.710
- And so, the last time I
checked with the social worker,

00:35:30.710 --> 00:35:33.903
I believe he's living in a
boarding care in the community.

00:35:35.850 --> 00:35:40.850
It takes a village to help
someone with special needs.

00:35:40.950 --> 00:35:43.646
It takes compassion, it takes commitment,

00:35:43.646 --> 00:35:47.630
and I think we can make
the impossible possible.

00:35:47.630 --> 00:35:51.773
Thank you very much.
(audience applauding)
