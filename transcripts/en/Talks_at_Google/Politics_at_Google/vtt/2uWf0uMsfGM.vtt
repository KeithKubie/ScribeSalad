[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.217 --> 00:00:06.300
SUSAN MOLINARI: Thank you.

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.310
And good afternoon.

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:10.180
So I have a surprise for you.

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:11.830
I'm not Kim Kardashian.

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:13.380
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.740
I have just totally embarrassed
my daughter to no end.

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:18.660
First of all, welcome.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.730
And thank you all
for being here.

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.530
Today, we're all
here because we want

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:25.350
to celebrate the freedom
of an amazing woman who

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.930
has made me cry at least
seven times since I've

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.670
been given the gift
to get to know her

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.270
in a very short period of time.

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:33.330
And I can't wait for
all of you to get

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:34.740
to know Ms. Alice Johnson.

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.800
She is a gift from
heaven and to remind us

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.150
why we're all here on Earth.

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:41.640
Before I get any
further with the remarks

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.340
that I've prepared, which I'm
clearly not going to stick to,

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.400
I want to just say a big
thank you to the family here.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.260
This is Ms. Alice
Johnson's family.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.669
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.639
So let me cut to the
chase for just a second.

00:01:00.639 --> 00:01:02.180
So to those of you
who don't know me,

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:03.280
my name is Susan Molinari.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.500
I'm so beyond the
point of why we're

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.330
all here, except
I run government

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.000
affairs and public
policy here at Google.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.440
And I've made some pretty
smart decisions in my life,

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.000
but one of my
smartest was to ask

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.338
a woman named Malika Saada Saar
to come work with us at Google.

00:01:19.338 --> 00:01:21.780
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.120
And you're going to
be hearing from her.

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.490
She's a human rights lawyer.

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.570
And we got to know
each other when

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.490
she was working
on a group dealing

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.400
with underaged
sex-trafficked young women

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.350
here in the United States.

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.740
I convinced her to come and
have a bigger platform at Google

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.599
and help us make some really
important changes by using

00:01:40.599 --> 00:01:42.390
the products, and the
people, and the heart

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:43.720
and soul of Google.

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.100
And she has gone a long way
to work with so many groups.

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.280
And at the end, I'm going
to thank them all-- but

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.440
our Everyone for Justice Group,
which is a bunch of volunteers

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.110
that helps out, our
dot-org people here,

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.940
with Jacquelline Fuller
and Justin Steele

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.554
and others who give up
their time and their money.

00:01:59.554 --> 00:02:02.220
Andy's going to come up and talk
a little bit about all the work

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.620
that BrandLab has been
doing, a labor of love.

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:07.860
So I want to thank everybody
for helping us celebrate

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.740
Ms. Alice's freedom and to
say thank you to everybody

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:12.645
who made this freedom possible.

00:02:12.645 --> 00:02:14.520
I never thought that
we'd have an opportunity

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.980
to say, in person, thank
you to Kim Kardashian

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.290
West for the fact
that she went to see

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:20.850
the President of
the United States

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.300
and asked him to look into
the situation of this woman,

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.340
this amazing woman
you're going to meet,

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:31.290
who ended up serving 21
years of a lifetime sentence

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:37.100
in jail for a first-time,
non-felony drug offense.

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.800
If she had committed that
crime today, few of us

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.660
doubt she would even
spent a day in jail.

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.200
But retroactivity
isn't part of the game.

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.620
So she kept herself together.

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.690
She kept her spirits together.

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:51.842
And again, her family kept that
hope alive so that she knew,

00:02:51.842 --> 00:02:54.050
when she was coming home,
she was coming home to such

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:56.090
a loving and supportive family.

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.100
And what so many people
who are dealing in this

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.650
have told me is the difference
between those who make it

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.900
and those who don't are
the support structure

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:03.680
outside the jail.

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.630
So again, thank you
for keeping our star

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:07.430
together so that
she can continue

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.447
to shine a light on all of us.

00:03:09.447 --> 00:03:11.030
So I've been asked,
just very briefly,

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.071
to set the stage for why Google
is involved in criminal justice

00:03:14.071 --> 00:03:14.570
reform.

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:17.030
So working out of
Washington, DC, Malika and I

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.370
have recognized that
it is really one

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:21.170
of the few bipartisan issues--

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:24.380
House, Senate,
Republicans, Democrats,

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:26.420
governors throughout
the state, local leaders

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:28.760
who understand that
the Criminal Justice

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.800
Project that we have
in the United States--

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.680
our system is anything
but just and that it needs

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.260
a lot of-- as David Drummond
once said, if there's anything

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.750
that needs disrupting,
and we're disruptors, it's

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:40.580
the criminal justice system.

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:43.010
It is a system that works
for very few people.

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.280
And certainly, based on your
socioeconomics, your color,

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.590
and your gender, it's not
going to work for you at all.

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:52.070
And so what we started to do
was look into ways that we,

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:54.060
as Google, could help this.

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:55.010
So we walked the walk.

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:57.770
I think many of you know
Google bans the box where

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:01.310
we don't ask people if they've
served any jail on their job

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:02.330
applications.

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:09.770
We have banned bail bonds ads,
which keep many people together

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:13.010
and owe exorbitant
prices by promises.

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:15.530
And we didn't want to make money
off that in any way, shape,

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:17.600
or form at Google.

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.610
And then we decided that it
was time to do something more,

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:24.330
to take our products
to tell a story,

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.530
because we're convinced that
the people in this country

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:30.680
are good people and that, if
they knew the truth about what

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.410
goes on in our criminal
justice system,

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:35.570
they would be enraged
and demand change.

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:37.580
If they knew for a
fact that there's

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:39.890
over 30 states that
still allow women

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:42.440
to be shackled when
they're giving birth,

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:44.120
they would be angry.

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.340
If they knew that there are
women in this country who

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:48.423
have to deal with whether
they should make a phone

00:04:48.423 --> 00:04:50.990
call to their family
or buy sanitary napkins

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:53.690
or tampons because they are
considered, by our prison

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:57.290
system, as non-essential,
every woman in this country

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:59.030
would be very mad.

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:01.040
If they knew that
the people at Rikers,

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.620
one of the worst
places in this country,

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:07.580
are consistent of 80% of
individuals who have not

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:12.170
seen trial yet, innocent until
proven guilty, but spending

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:16.100
years of their lives behind
bars because the only thing

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:18.320
they can be convicted
of at that point

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:21.680
is not having enough
money to make bail or get

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:23.580
a good lawyer--

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:28.910
so what we decided at Google
was the problem is nobody hears

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:31.830
them, nobody sees them, right?

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:35.580
We want to turn a blind eye
to all those injustices.

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:38.150
But we have the products at
Google, particularly YouTube,

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:40.340
that allows us to
crawl behind the wall

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:43.520
and get behind the prison gates
so that we can tell their story

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:45.060
and give them voice.

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:48.260
And that's what we did here and
what we're continuing to do.

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.080
So just very briefly, and
then I'm off the stage,

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:54.280
we went with YouTube, and
with the help of Andy,

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:57.080
to put together a video
where Ms. Alice spoke

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.960
behind bars and behind
glass on a phone

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:03.420
and talked about what 21
years away from her family,

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:06.260
her children, her grandchildren,
now her great-grandchildren,

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:09.980
have been for an offense
that she wished she never

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:13.801
made, but just wants to get out
of prison to be with her family

00:06:13.801 --> 00:06:14.300
again.

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:16.070
She talked about all
the other inmates

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:19.070
that are in there in
the very same situation.

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:21.860
And then there was a group
called [INAUDIBLE] she

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:24.960
challenged everybody who
watched to go out there and tell

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:27.140
these stories to give
faces to the faceless,

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:30.110
to give voices to those people
who feel like no one else

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:31.190
cares.

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:34.280
And there was a
creator called mic.com,

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:38.210
who wrote an op-ed on behalf of
Ms. Alice with our Google team.

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:40.077
And that's what
Kim Kardashian saw

00:06:40.077 --> 00:06:42.410
and what she took to the
President of the United States.

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:44.630
So Google, you helped do this.

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:47.510
You helped to free this woman
so that she can bear witness

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:49.010
to the stories that
need to be told.

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:50.840
So congratulations,
Google, first of all.

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:53.572
Yes, give everybody a
round of applause here.

00:06:53.572 --> 00:06:57.460
[APPLAUSE]

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:01.630
In closing, just let me
say, today we celebrate,

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:03.340
but we acknowledge our work.

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:04.600
There's so much more to do.

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:07.690
There's so many more souls
who are waiting to be rescued.

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:10.690
And we know that when
we celebrate Ms. Johnson

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:13.240
and thank these advocacy
organizations, who are also

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:17.350
here, to whom we honor with
their presence, who have stood

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:19.630
fast behind individuals
like Ms. Alice

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:22.540
before Google ever got there
and kept their spirits up,

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:24.310
we're honored to be
here with all of you.

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:25.570
Thank you.

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:28.430
So clearly, there are
still too many women, men,

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:31.570
and children who are
made to feel powerless,

00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:34.510
and then whose families are
scarred and scared, and then

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:37.780
whose neighborhoods are broken,
and then whose country is not

00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:40.390
living up to its full destiny.

00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:42.820
So with that, I want to
thank you all for being here

00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:44.840
to allow us to tell this story.

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:47.130
And now I want to introduce
one of our partners, Andy

00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:48.700
[? Berndt ?] who,
most of you know,

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:53.470
is from BrandLab, who has
sort of taken this up.

00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:55.960
He has been to, I think, four
or five prisons already--

00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:58.690
is going to San
Quentin next week--

00:07:58.690 --> 00:08:01.360
has used his genius to help
tell this story and help

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:03.520
put together a lot
of what reached

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:07.540
the imagination of individuals
throughout this country

00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:10.930
to help tell Ms. Alice's story
and so many others behind bars.

00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:13.570
He has really been
instrumental at Google

00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:15.360
in leading our
commitment to justice.

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:16.632
Andy?

00:08:16.632 --> 00:08:19.894
[APPLAUSE]

00:08:20.594 --> 00:08:21.760
[? ANDY BERNDT: ?] Good job.

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:22.290
Good job.

00:08:22.290 --> 00:08:23.590
SUSAN MOLINARI: I give big hug.

00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:25.710
[? ANDY BERNDT: ?]
How about that?

00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:27.820
OK, still not Kim Kardashian.

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:29.885
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:29.885 --> 00:08:31.390
Just to be clear.

00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:34.539
So I'm only up here for
a few minutes, I promise.

00:08:34.539 --> 00:08:38.080
What I wanted to
say, though, was

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:42.640
I would say about three years
ago, during a lot of the really

00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:44.260
tough Black Lives
Matter moments,

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.895
we got together as
a team in New York.

00:08:46.895 --> 00:08:49.020
And a lot of Googlers, a
lot of people on the team,

00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:51.574
were feeling really
horrible, deeply horrible.

00:08:51.574 --> 00:08:52.990
And through a lot
of conversations

00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:54.150
what we realized was--

00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:55.840
and maybe we knew
this a little bit,

00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:57.280
but we didn't know it enough--

00:08:57.280 --> 00:08:59.620
that we really didn't
have enough understanding

00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:02.680
and empathy about the
way lots of people live.

00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:04.666
And Google, at its best--

00:09:04.666 --> 00:09:06.040
my favorite thing
about Google is

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:07.720
if you look around
hard enough, you

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:10.634
will find a genius in any field.

00:09:10.634 --> 00:09:12.050
And they work
somewhere at Google.

00:09:12.050 --> 00:09:13.780
And you have to get
[INAUDIBLE] troll

00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:15.980
and all those sorts of things.

00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:17.630
But you will find them.

00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:20.770
And we were lucky enough that,
with the help of a few friends,

00:09:20.770 --> 00:09:24.284
we we had families of
incarcerated people come in.

00:09:24.284 --> 00:09:26.200
We had previously
incarcerated people come in.

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:28.575
We had all kinds of people
come in and just talk with us.

00:09:28.575 --> 00:09:31.540
So we knew a lot of people
by first name from a world

00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:34.240
that a lot of us didn't
really understand.

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:36.700
I was going explain how then
Malika came to the scene.

00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:38.464
And I just asked
her, how did we meet?

00:09:38.464 --> 00:09:40.630
And she said, well, you
were looking for a bathroom.

00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:43.240
And you came in this conference
room, and you were like, what?

00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:44.156
And that's how we met.

00:09:44.156 --> 00:09:48.490
So that's not really
that great a story.

00:09:48.490 --> 00:09:52.030
However, I must
say about Malika--

00:09:52.030 --> 00:09:53.780
I think we've gone
to four prisons now--

00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:56.050
Detroit, women's
prison in New Jersey.

00:09:56.050 --> 00:09:57.640
We're going to San
Quentin next week.

00:10:01.090 --> 00:10:02.770
Malika's a special person.

00:10:02.770 --> 00:10:05.510
She is the kind of person that
you feel so lucky to know,

00:10:05.510 --> 00:10:08.264
to meet, to have known,
to have worked with.

00:10:08.264 --> 00:10:09.680
She will take you
under her spell,

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:11.221
and you will find
that you do things,

00:10:11.221 --> 00:10:13.010
whether you want to
or not, because she's

00:10:13.010 --> 00:10:15.140
told you to do them.

00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:16.760
And she's amazing.

00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:19.280
It makes me proud to work here
because I get to finally work

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:20.422
with people like Malika.

00:10:20.422 --> 00:10:21.880
She's probably
embarrassed at this.

00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:25.460
But tough, she deserves it.

00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:27.710
My ability to get
my group involved

00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:30.920
in things that are meaningful
to them, that are important,

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:34.340
that they feel are worth
everything they put into them,

00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:38.390
even if they're a
2%, 3%, 5% effort,

00:10:38.390 --> 00:10:40.400
makes all the difference.

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:42.380
And it's all informal.

00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:44.091
It's all people
just meeting people.

00:10:44.091 --> 00:10:45.590
If you want to get
involved, I think

00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:47.090
Maab will talk about
how to do that.

00:10:47.090 --> 00:10:48.950
But if you have
the ability to get

00:10:48.950 --> 00:10:52.857
involved in any kind of
these efforts, just do.

00:10:52.857 --> 00:10:53.760
Just get it started.

00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:57.590
All it needs is a few friends
and someone who cares.

00:10:57.590 --> 00:10:59.000
And people will back you up.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.180
So I'm supposed to
also introduce a video

00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:02.700
and mostly get off the stage.

00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:04.520
You'll see a video
here that's kind of

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:08.070
made by a whole lot of
people, pieces from all over.

00:11:08.070 --> 00:11:10.190
It's nice that it was
one of the things that

00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:12.590
kicked this whole
thing into motion,

00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:15.560
with a lot of other
elements that eventually

00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:21.350
led to the amazing moment
of Ms. Alice leaving prison.

00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:24.140
So I won't stand
in the way anymore.

00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:25.130
We can play this video.

00:11:25.130 --> 00:11:26.990
And then she'll
come out and chat.

00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:27.788
Thanks.

00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:39.080
ALICE JOHNSON: In 1996, my life
drastically changed forever.

00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:42.800
I was convicted as a first-time,
non-violent drug offender

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:46.480
and sentenced to life
in federal prison.

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:51.400
I'd always thought that only the
most heinous crimes warranted

00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:53.860
a life without parole sentence.

00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:56.875
I have the exact same
sentence as Charles Manson.

00:11:59.470 --> 00:12:02.050
DAVID DRUMMOND: We like to
think of Google as a platform

00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:04.230
for disruptive innovation.

00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:08.500
And if there's anything that
needs to be disrupted today,

00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:10.850
it's the system of
mass incarceration.

00:12:10.850 --> 00:12:12.880
MALIKA SAADA SAAR: This
issue is at the center

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:16.490
of all of our work, and
communities, and lives.

00:12:16.490 --> 00:12:17.615
It is not marginal.

00:12:24.834 --> 00:12:26.750
JOHN LEGEND: To end the
human suffering caused

00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:31.190
by mass incarceration, we
have to make love the focus.

00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:35.270
I am honored to present these
love letters from children

00:12:35.270 --> 00:12:37.516
to their incarcerated fathers.

00:12:37.516 --> 00:12:38.390
SPEAKER 1: Dear dad--

00:12:38.390 --> 00:12:40.230
SPEAKER 2: It has been eight
years since I saw you last.

00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:42.021
SPEAKER 3: I want to
express myself to you.

00:12:42.021 --> 00:12:43.396
I haven't done it
in a long time.

00:12:43.396 --> 00:12:44.895
SPEAKER 4: I just
wanted to tell you

00:12:44.895 --> 00:12:46.166
how much I love and miss you.

00:12:46.166 --> 00:12:48.290
SPEAKER 5: I want you to
see me graduate next year.

00:12:48.290 --> 00:12:49.820
SPEAKER 6: Going to attend
college in the fall.

00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:51.070
SPEAKER 7: Happy
Father's Day, dad.

00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:52.720
SPEAKER 8: Happy
Father's Day, dad.

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:54.345
SPEAKER 9: Your one
and only baby girl.

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:00.270
ALICE JOHNSON: Google
is a company that

00:13:00.270 --> 00:13:04.690
has been greatly blessed,
to whom much is given,

00:13:04.690 --> 00:13:06.360
much is required.

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:10.080
When you use your
voice, people listen.

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:15.480
When you champion a cause,
our leadership listens.

00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:19.130
You may say, am I my
brother's or sister's keeper?

00:13:19.130 --> 00:13:23.950
And I say you today,
if not you, then who?

00:13:23.950 --> 00:13:25.893
If not now, then when?

Hey, everybody.

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:53.490
Welcome.

00:13:53.490 --> 00:13:57.680
It's such a wonderful honor
to have all of you with us,

00:13:57.680 --> 00:14:02.640
to have this moment with Ms.
Alice and Kim Kardashian.

00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:05.910
I'm going to put my mom
hat on and first say,

00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:09.850
we cannot have any video
or pictures going on.

00:14:09.850 --> 00:14:12.870
And if you do it, security is
going to tell you to leave.

00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:15.040
So understood.

00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:22.380
With that, it is my absolute
honor, and privilege,

00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:28.200
and pleasure, to introduce you
to Alice Marie Johnson and Kim

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:29.414
Kardashian.

[CHEERING]

00:15:11.175 --> 00:15:13.230
Ms. Alice, I want
to start with you.

00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:20.640
I want us to get grounded
in the hard part first.

00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:28.370
Ms. Alice, when I first
saw you behind bars

00:15:28.370 --> 00:15:37.870
to this moment here, you
have been unbowed, unbroken,

00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:39.110
and mighty.

00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:41.070
ALICE JOHNSON: Thank you.

00:15:41.070 --> 00:15:44.040
MALIKA SAADA SAAR:
But most of us here,

00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:50.120
we don't know what the inside
of a jail or prison looks like.

00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:53.120
Most of us here,
we don't know what

00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:58.400
it feels like to have a
loved one behind bars.

00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:04.240
So I want you to ground
us in and start us out

00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:10.690
by talking about what it's like
to be in a human cage, what

00:16:10.690 --> 00:16:16.000
it's like to be there for
two decades, as a mother,

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.840
and as a grandmother.

00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:23.050
ALICE JOHNSON: As a
mother, as a grandmother,

00:16:23.050 --> 00:16:29.570
a great-grandmother, a
sister, a daughter, an aunt,

00:16:29.570 --> 00:16:35.420
if any of you can just imagine
having your mother away from

00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:41.030
you for almost 22 years,
what that would feel like,

00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:43.820
to have the person
who is truly--

00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:47.580
we, as mothers, know that a
mother is really the nucleus,

00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:52.520
not downplaying any role
that a man does in the home.

00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:57.130
But to have your mother, the
one who kisses the boo-boos

00:16:57.130 --> 00:17:00.080
and gives you the little
comfort that you need--

00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:04.190
to be separated from my children
was an ache that I cannot even

00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:06.359
describe to you.

00:17:06.359 --> 00:17:07.849
I look at pictures--

00:17:07.849 --> 00:17:10.730
coming back home after
this time in prison,

00:17:10.730 --> 00:17:14.290
I look at pictures
that I'm missing from.

00:17:14.290 --> 00:17:16.730
I look at moments
that my children

00:17:16.730 --> 00:17:19.730
have to share with
me that I've missed.

00:17:19.730 --> 00:17:22.099
One thing that I
did not ever do--

00:17:22.099 --> 00:17:26.000
and I never stopped being
mama to my children.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.600
And I tried to be
there for them.

00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:33.160
They still depended
upon me for advice.

00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:34.880
And they shared moments.

00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:37.670
But just not physically
being there--

00:17:37.670 --> 00:17:41.750
there's nothing that I can
describe to you that pain.

00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:45.530
And also, one of the things
that my children and my family

00:17:45.530 --> 00:17:46.850
never knew--

00:17:46.850 --> 00:17:49.200
they never knew
how heartbreaking.

00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:51.050
It was heartbreaking
for them when

00:17:51.050 --> 00:17:53.240
I'd call home on a holiday.

00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:56.850
And I'd have to let tears
fall, talking to them,

00:17:56.850 --> 00:18:00.170
but keep a smile in my voice
so that they wouldn't be sad.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.050
MALIKA SAADA SAAR:
And Kim, you first

00:18:05.050 --> 00:18:10.030
found out about Ms. Alice
because of this digital op-ed

00:18:10.030 --> 00:18:12.520
that she did that went viral.

00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:18.710
Can you talk about what that was
like to see that image of her?

00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:23.260
And also, why did you
decide to take action?

00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:25.090
KIM KARDASHIAN WEST:
Seeing that video

00:18:25.090 --> 00:18:27.880
that you guys saw a clip
of, that's what I saw.

00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:32.410
And someone that I follow
on Twitter posted it.

00:18:32.410 --> 00:18:36.080
And I happened to be on my
phone at that exact moment.

00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:39.280
So I always say,
Ms. Alice found me.

00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:47.100
And I just connected
with who I saw, and not

00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:49.320
even having to meet her.

00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:50.910
I come from a big family.

00:18:50.910 --> 00:18:54.750
And hearing about her
family, I thought, well,

00:18:54.750 --> 00:18:58.200
what wouldn't my mom have
done to feed her children?

00:19:01.950 --> 00:19:05.730
Now, me being a mom, I would do
anything to feed my children.

00:19:05.730 --> 00:19:09.630
So I know that in
a case like that,

00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:12.330
we're all just a
bad decision away

00:19:12.330 --> 00:19:18.540
from maybe being in a
position like Alice was in.

00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:19.830
And to hear her say--

00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:23.260
what was so clear to me is she
got the same exact sentence

00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:25.290
as Charles Manson--

00:19:25.290 --> 00:19:26.760
that's insanity.

00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:29.170
That's just our
system failing us.

00:19:29.170 --> 00:19:38.620
So if I felt like I had the
power to make a phone call

00:19:38.620 --> 00:19:43.330
and I can possibly
change someone's life,

00:19:43.330 --> 00:19:46.060
I was going to try.

00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:48.280
MALIKA SAADA SAAR: And you
talked about, sometimes,

00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:50.260
that's an issue of courage.

00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:53.900
So where did you find that
courage to take that act?

00:19:56.201 --> 00:19:58.700
KIM KARDASHIAN WEST: Honestly,
for me, it was just something

00:19:58.700 --> 00:20:02.760
that I felt I had to do.

00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:05.710
I feel like the courageous
part might have been more

00:20:05.710 --> 00:20:07.410
my husband speaking out.

00:20:07.410 --> 00:20:14.190
I think his support kind
of opened the door for me

00:20:14.190 --> 00:20:17.824
to be able for them to
really answer my call

00:20:17.824 --> 00:20:18.990
and get me through the door.

00:20:18.990 --> 00:20:22.900
So I'm really well
aware of that.

00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:27.530
And it wasn't even a question.

00:20:27.530 --> 00:20:32.130
It was just I felt like
I had that connection,

00:20:32.130 --> 00:20:33.957
and I was going to try.

00:20:33.957 --> 00:20:35.540
MALIKA SAADA SAAR:
So my understanding

00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:37.880
is that you were
the first person

00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:41.900
to tell Ms. Alice that she
had been granted clemency.

00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:42.860
Is that right?

00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:44.193
KIM KARDASHIAN WEST: Yes, it is.

00:20:44.193 --> 00:20:46.250
And I thought she
knew already because I

00:20:46.250 --> 00:20:48.120
had told her attorneys.

00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:51.660
So when they connected
us on the phone,

00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:53.780
I was in the middle
of a photo shoot.

00:20:53.780 --> 00:20:54.410
And I--

00:20:54.410 --> 00:20:56.998
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:57.875 --> 00:20:58.850
--a nude shoot.

00:20:58.850 --> 00:21:00.660
It will probably be my last one.

00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:03.680
But it kind of shook me
up that I got the call

00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:04.560
from the president.

00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:06.200
I had to grab a robe--

00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:07.182
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:07.182 --> 00:21:10.340
--and then call Ms. Alice.

00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:12.170
Luckily, we were
filming my show.

00:21:12.170 --> 00:21:15.140
So we'll see that
really special moment.

00:21:15.140 --> 00:21:20.570
But I was kind of shocked
because I thought she knew.

00:21:20.570 --> 00:21:23.360
And so when I got on the
phone, she was so calm.

00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:26.990
And I think she thought it
was a regular check-in call

00:21:26.990 --> 00:21:28.460
with her attorneys.

00:21:28.460 --> 00:21:33.080
And then I said, Ms.
Alice, you don't know?

00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:33.710
You're free.

00:21:33.710 --> 00:21:34.720
You're going home.

00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:38.420
And it was screaming and
crying for maybe three minutes

00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:39.960
straight.

00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:41.810
And I was trying to
not cry my makeup off

00:21:41.810 --> 00:21:45.031
because I had spent
three hours in makeup.

00:21:45.031 --> 00:21:48.470
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:48.470 --> 00:21:49.790
It's true.

00:21:49.790 --> 00:21:52.490
It sounds crazy.

00:21:52.490 --> 00:21:53.695
ALICE JOHNSON: I went crazy.

00:21:53.695 --> 00:21:54.880
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:58.445
I think I was jumping so high,
I almost hit that tall ceiling.

00:21:58.445 --> 00:22:01.080
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:03.320
MALIKA SAADA SAAR: Usually,
in clemency situations,

00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:06.560
there is a period of
time between when you've

00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:09.560
been granted the clemency
and then when you

00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:11.870
are able to walk out of prison.

00:22:11.870 --> 00:22:15.424
But you walked out within
hours of finding out.

00:22:15.424 --> 00:22:16.340
ALICE JOHNSON: Uh-huh.

00:22:16.340 --> 00:22:18.410
MALIKA SAADA SAAR:
You told me the story

00:22:18.410 --> 00:22:21.159
of what it was like to
walk out of that prison.

00:22:21.159 --> 00:22:21.950
ALICE JOHNSON: Yes.

00:22:21.950 --> 00:22:23.210
MALIKA SAADA SAAR: Can
you share that with us?

00:22:23.210 --> 00:22:24.080
ALICE JOHNSON: Yes.

00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:28.880
When I walked out of prison,
it sounded like an earthquake.

00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:29.940
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:33.080
The women there-- there are
three buildings with four

00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:36.560
different housing units,
so you've got 12 units--

00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:38.750
every single woman--

00:22:38.750 --> 00:22:40.640
I'm going to say
every single woman--

00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:43.830
was at the window, or trying
to climb over someone.

00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:45.830
They were beating
the window with cups.

00:22:45.830 --> 00:22:47.150
They were screaming.

00:22:47.150 --> 00:22:49.220
They were shouting for me.

00:22:49.220 --> 00:22:53.150
All you could hear was this
huge sound, this big sound.

00:22:53.150 --> 00:22:57.800
And as we drove out,
the women at the camp--

00:22:57.800 --> 00:23:00.110
they weren't in the
building, locked down.

00:23:00.110 --> 00:23:03.590
But the women at the
camp were all lined up.

00:23:03.590 --> 00:23:05.810
They were all lined
up, all of the campers.

00:23:05.810 --> 00:23:07.640
There were officers lined up.

00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:09.410
People were screaming.

00:23:09.410 --> 00:23:10.310
They were crying.

00:23:10.310 --> 00:23:11.780
They were waving.

00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:15.680
It was the most
incredible going out.

00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:18.500
It was the most
incredible experience,

00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:21.830
looking at all of the support
that I had from the women

00:23:21.830 --> 00:23:23.390
who were still incarcerated.

00:23:23.390 --> 00:23:28.280
And that's one image, Malika,
that is still stuck in my mind,

00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:29.930
in my mind's eye--

00:23:29.930 --> 00:23:33.290
the faces of those women
who have been left behind.

00:23:33.290 --> 00:23:36.530
And that is one of the
reasons that you will see me

00:23:36.530 --> 00:23:39.260
on any platform
that they will allow

00:23:39.260 --> 00:23:44.240
me to use my voice to champion
this cause of criminal justice

00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:45.782
reform.

00:23:45.782 --> 00:23:49.184
[APPLAUSE]

00:23:54.044 --> 00:23:56.819
MALIKA SAADA SAAR: Because you
talk about the joy of freedom--

00:23:56.819 --> 00:23:57.610
ALICE JOHNSON: Yes.

00:23:57.610 --> 00:24:00.640
MALIKA SAADA SAAR: --of being
reconnected to your family.

00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:03.940
But you also talk about
how you are haunted

00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:05.819
by the women you left behind.

00:24:05.819 --> 00:24:06.610
ALICE JOHNSON: Yes.

00:24:06.610 --> 00:24:08.230
I told them when I left--

00:24:08.230 --> 00:24:11.140
I left a letter for them.

00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:14.050
I scribbled a quick
letter to tell them

00:24:14.050 --> 00:24:16.720
that I would never
forget them, I

00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:19.060
would never stop
fighting for them,

00:24:19.060 --> 00:24:22.020
because they have been
tattooed on my heart.

00:24:22.020 --> 00:24:25.460
And I cannot forget them
because it's bigger than me.

00:24:25.460 --> 00:24:29.200
And when I speak, I
humanize the issue.

00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:32.920
It's easy to read about someone
and just think about, well,

00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:35.540
that was a sad story,
and forget them.

00:24:35.540 --> 00:24:38.680
But when you see my face,
you see their faces.

00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:41.560
And it's pretty hard
to forget someone

00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:44.900
who has experienced what I've
experienced and to see me.

00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:46.120
My family is here today.

00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:47.410
All of my children are here.

00:24:47.410 --> 00:24:49.170
You hear the little
babies over there?

00:24:49.170 --> 00:24:52.900
Those are my grand-twins.

00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:55.130
My two sisters are here.

00:24:55.130 --> 00:24:59.170
This is a moment that they
never expected to see,

00:24:59.170 --> 00:25:01.810
something like this
happening for me.

00:25:01.810 --> 00:25:08.154
And to have them share in this
moment with me means so much.

00:25:08.154 --> 00:25:09.470
MALIKA SAADA SAAR: Yes.

00:25:09.470 --> 00:25:15.150
So Kim, Ms. Alice's freedom is
not the end of your efforts,

00:25:15.150 --> 00:25:15.890
right?

00:25:15.890 --> 00:25:20.630
You have raised up the
story of Cyntoia Brown.

00:25:20.630 --> 00:25:22.370
And if I could
just, for a moment,

00:25:22.370 --> 00:25:26.360
talk about Cyntoia Brown,
who was bought and sold

00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:29.760
for sex as a child
in this country

00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:32.900
and, out of
self-defense, killed one

00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:38.240
of the men who purchased her and
is now serving a life sentence.

00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:42.740
And she is representative
of so many girls, especially

00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:45.350
our black and brown girls,
who are bought and sold

00:25:45.350 --> 00:25:50.930
for sex and criminalized,
instead of seen as victims

00:25:50.930 --> 00:25:53.660
of commercial serial rape.

00:25:53.660 --> 00:25:55.970
You have talked about her.

00:25:55.970 --> 00:25:58.310
You have talked
about Chris Young,

00:25:58.310 --> 00:26:02.600
who is serving a life
sentence for a drug felony.

00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:03.820
Can you tell us more about--

00:26:03.820 --> 00:26:05.180
KIM KARDASHIAN WEST:
A minor drug felony.

00:26:05.180 --> 00:26:05.760
MALIKA SAADA SAAR: A minor--

00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:06.350
that's right.

00:26:06.350 --> 00:26:08.058
KIM KARDASHIAN WEST:
Marijuana and a half

00:26:08.058 --> 00:26:09.180
of a gram of cocaine.

00:26:09.180 --> 00:26:11.513
MALIKA SAADA SAAR: So talk
to us about these individuals

00:26:11.513 --> 00:26:15.660
and why you are seeking
clemency for them.

00:26:15.660 --> 00:26:18.450
KIM KARDASHIAN WEST:
Just meeting Alice

00:26:18.450 --> 00:26:24.360
and knowing that
she just represented

00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:28.140
the fact that there are
thousands of women and men

00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:31.010
like Alice that--

00:26:31.010 --> 00:26:34.890
it's just the system
is completely broken.

00:26:34.890 --> 00:26:39.210
And knowing that I was
able to make a change,

00:26:39.210 --> 00:26:43.710
but also seeing the
president maybe a week

00:26:43.710 --> 00:26:51.669
before I went in, say
something horrific, like--

00:26:51.669 --> 00:26:53.210
I don't even know
what the quote was,

00:26:53.210 --> 00:26:55.100
but something that he would--

00:26:55.100 --> 00:26:58.940
being super hard
on crime and drugs

00:26:58.940 --> 00:27:00.740
and thinking that
there was no hope.

00:27:00.740 --> 00:27:05.330
And then going there and
having him hear Alice's story

00:27:05.330 --> 00:27:09.800
and completely hear
me and understand

00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:15.500
that there was a big, big
problem in the system,

00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:18.110
and then talking
to Jared so much,

00:27:18.110 --> 00:27:20.420
who I have a really
good relationship with

00:27:20.420 --> 00:27:24.140
and who has really been pushing
this whole thing, and prison

00:27:24.140 --> 00:27:25.910
reform, and the FIRST STEP Act--

00:27:25.910 --> 00:27:28.490
and everyone's really
getting behind it.

00:27:28.490 --> 00:27:35.420
And that's our goal, is to pass
bills and get the president

00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:40.080
to endorse these bills that will
change so many people's lives.

00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:43.610
So I just felt like I saw
hope when I went in there.

00:27:43.610 --> 00:27:48.490
And I feel like
what I had to say

00:27:48.490 --> 00:27:51.070
and what our team of
attorneys that we've

00:27:51.070 --> 00:27:53.770
been working with that really
helped me with the messaging--

00:27:53.770 --> 00:27:56.500
I couldn't do it without
Brittany, who's here,

00:27:56.500 --> 00:28:01.960
and cut50, and everyone
that I work with--

00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:05.410
I saw hope in the
White House, that they

00:28:05.410 --> 00:28:06.565
wanted to make a change.

00:28:09.940 --> 00:28:15.610
It just really made me feel
like I couldn't stop and that,

00:28:15.610 --> 00:28:18.970
if I had a voice and
we were able to do

00:28:18.970 --> 00:28:21.760
what we did with
Alice, that I just

00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:23.800
want to encourage everyone.

00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:25.150
You know, I always say this.

00:28:25.150 --> 00:28:28.420
And Van Jones and I talk
about this all the time.

00:28:28.420 --> 00:28:33.530
For people that don't want
to go to the White House,

00:28:33.530 --> 00:28:36.890
I completely understand if you
don't agree with the policies,

00:28:36.890 --> 00:28:37.880
like myself.

00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:40.170
I might not agree with
everything that goes on,

00:28:40.170 --> 00:28:43.940
but I couldn't wait four more
years or eight more years

00:28:43.940 --> 00:28:46.520
to help save Alice
or the people inside.

00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:51.320
And if you ask Alice or
if you ask anybody inside

00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:53.540
if they care who
the president is,

00:28:53.540 --> 00:28:58.430
or if they want you to wait four
more years or eight more years,

00:28:58.430 --> 00:29:01.010
I guarantee you they
would all say no.

00:29:01.010 --> 00:29:04.970
So I just want to be the voice
to encourage other people

00:29:04.970 --> 00:29:08.690
to step up and other
people to use their voice

00:29:08.690 --> 00:29:13.790
to speak to the White
House and make changes.

00:29:13.790 --> 00:29:16.590
And our voices are powerful.

00:29:16.590 --> 00:29:19.490
MALIKA SAADA SAAR: And this is
a hard time for criminal justice

00:29:19.490 --> 00:29:24.680
reform because we do have an AG,
we do have Jeff Sessions, who

00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:26.930
does believe in
mandatory minimums

00:29:26.930 --> 00:29:30.440
and who has not been
an advocate of reform.

00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:34.160
But part of what
you are able to do,

00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:37.400
because of your following
on social media,

00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:40.790
because of your presence
in popular culture,

00:29:40.790 --> 00:29:44.420
is to raise awareness,
is to name the issue

00:29:44.420 --> 00:29:46.280
of mass incarceration.

00:29:46.280 --> 00:29:50.750
Can you just tell us a little
bit more about Chris Young

00:29:50.750 --> 00:29:56.510
and allow us to understand why
his life is important to know,

00:29:56.510 --> 00:29:59.957
and what has happened to him,
as well as Cyntoia Brown?

00:29:59.957 --> 00:30:01.040
KIM KARDASHIAN WEST: Yeah.

00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:05.480
So Chris Young has been in
prison for almost nine years.

00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:07.640
And he is 30 years old.

00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:12.470
He made bad choices--

00:30:12.470 --> 00:30:16.080
low-level drug offender.

00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:18.260
He had marijuana.

00:30:18.260 --> 00:30:22.610
On the floor of his car, he
had, like, crumbs of cocaine.

00:30:22.610 --> 00:30:24.590
And so they couldn't
even measure it,

00:30:24.590 --> 00:30:26.430
so they just said
it was half a gram.

00:30:26.430 --> 00:30:29.660
And he had two previous
really low-level charges,

00:30:29.660 --> 00:30:33.780
like the one that
he was charged with.

00:30:33.780 --> 00:30:36.140
And so they gave him life.

00:30:36.140 --> 00:30:39.280
And he has sickle cell anemia.

00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:40.820
He's been in and
out of hospitals--

00:30:40.820 --> 00:30:42.350
two hip replacements.

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:48.480
And even just what Alice said--

00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:51.570
Chris has the same
sentence as Charles Manson.

00:30:51.570 --> 00:30:56.740
That just, to me,
sounds so insane.

00:30:56.740 --> 00:31:03.340
So anyone that I
can bring light to,

00:31:03.340 --> 00:31:07.330
just to share how
he's in-- because

00:31:07.330 --> 00:31:11.660
of mandatory minimums, the
judge sentenced him to life.

00:31:11.660 --> 00:31:13.886
And since then, the
judge has resigned.

00:31:13.886 --> 00:31:15.760
And the judge came with
me to the White House

00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:20.400
to talk to the president
about how he could not

00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:25.040
live with himself having
to sentence these young men

00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:30.357
and women for life over
really low-level drug crimes.

00:31:30.357 --> 00:31:31.690
MALIKA SAADA SAAR: That's right.

00:31:31.690 --> 00:31:32.490
That's right.

00:31:32.490 --> 00:31:36.600
Ms. Alice, you are free now.

00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:39.420
And it's only been
four months, right?

00:31:39.420 --> 00:31:40.380
ALICE JOHNSON: Yes.

00:31:40.380 --> 00:31:42.120
MALIKA SAADA SAAR:
So can you talk to us

00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:46.410
about what is the
work for you in trying

00:31:46.410 --> 00:31:49.230
to fight mass
incarceration, in trying

00:31:49.230 --> 00:31:54.360
to talk about the ways in which
our families, our communities,

00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:59.580
have been broken because of the
very real costs of this type

00:31:59.580 --> 00:32:03.080
of over-criminalization?

00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:04.610
ALICE JOHNSON: The main thing--

00:32:04.610 --> 00:32:06.140
I believe the main
purpose that I'm

00:32:06.140 --> 00:32:09.230
serving in lifting up
my voice and showing you

00:32:09.230 --> 00:32:12.560
my face is to
humanize this issue.

00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:16.430
Someone has to humanize
this issue so that you just

00:32:16.430 --> 00:32:19.670
don't read about
a person, you just

00:32:19.670 --> 00:32:22.420
don't see some
numbers or a profile

00:32:22.420 --> 00:32:27.920
that someone has fed you about
a person, that you see me.

00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:29.600
You see my family.

00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:31.400
You see my friends.

00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:33.470
You see others when you see me.

00:32:33.470 --> 00:32:36.620
And I must continue to
fight for this issue

00:32:36.620 --> 00:32:42.200
because, as I asked Google, and
you came up to the challenge,

00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:45.120
if not you, then who?

00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:46.997
If not me, then who?

00:32:46.997 --> 00:32:48.330
MALIKA SAADA SAAR: That's right.

00:32:48.330 --> 00:32:49.220
That's right.

00:32:49.220 --> 00:32:54.500
So Kim, how do we get more
celebrities and influencers

00:32:54.500 --> 00:33:02.510
to do the activist work, to try
to disrupt mass incarceration

00:33:02.510 --> 00:33:04.790
the way you are doing?

00:33:04.790 --> 00:33:07.730
KIM KARDASHIAN WEST: Well, I
do see people like John Legend

00:33:07.730 --> 00:33:11.480
and Common are very
vocal and do speak up

00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:14.300
about mass incarceration
all the time.

00:33:14.300 --> 00:33:17.330
I've visited a
prison with Common.

00:33:17.330 --> 00:33:20.600
I know they're very passionate
about the same thing.

00:33:23.150 --> 00:33:25.250
My husband is going to
the White House tomorrow.

00:33:25.250 --> 00:33:28.980
And I know he's bringing
up the topic as well.

00:33:28.980 --> 00:33:31.500
And it's something he's
really passionate about.

00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:34.310
So I personally just
urge people to--

00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:41.150
it's a tough situation because
the president has said,

00:33:41.150 --> 00:33:43.360
if anyone wants to talk
to me about clemencies

00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:46.150
and they want to talk to me
about prison reform, I'm here.

00:33:46.150 --> 00:33:47.620
Come and talk to me.

00:33:47.620 --> 00:33:53.140
So for me, I've seen that
that has become a reality.

00:33:53.140 --> 00:33:58.120
And like I mentioned earlier,
I don't think the people inside

00:33:58.120 --> 00:33:59.600
want to wait those years.

00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:00.350
ALICE JOHNSON: No.

00:34:00.350 --> 00:34:01.849
KIM KARDASHIAN WEST:
So I just would

00:34:01.849 --> 00:34:03.760
urge people to talk
to the president,

00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:07.540
to talk to Jared Kushner,
to continue to speak out

00:34:07.540 --> 00:34:08.469
through social media.

00:34:08.469 --> 00:34:09.520
Share stories.

00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:11.139
If I hadn't been
on social media,

00:34:11.139 --> 00:34:12.870
I wouldn't have
seen Alice's story.

00:34:12.870 --> 00:34:17.350
So even people just
passing along stories--

00:34:17.350 --> 00:34:18.110
reach out to me.

00:34:18.110 --> 00:34:19.960
I'm not afraid to go
to the White House.

00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:20.530
Let me know.

00:34:20.530 --> 00:34:22.030
I'll take a story there.

00:34:22.030 --> 00:34:23.889
ALICE JOHNSON: I just
want to say this, too,

00:34:23.889 --> 00:34:28.360
is it took a lot of
courage on the part of Kim

00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:30.130
to go to the White House.

00:34:30.130 --> 00:34:33.250
It takes courage
to do something.

00:34:33.250 --> 00:34:36.489
It takes courage to act.

00:34:36.489 --> 00:34:39.639
To be an activist means
that you've got to act.

00:34:39.639 --> 00:34:41.199
You've got to do something.

00:34:41.199 --> 00:34:44.530
You just can't turn your
head, as Kim said, and wait

00:34:44.530 --> 00:34:46.200
another four years,
or six years,

00:34:46.200 --> 00:34:50.620
or eight years until you
do something about this.

00:34:50.620 --> 00:34:52.870
As I've said before,
you've got to be

00:34:52.870 --> 00:34:54.550
willing to sit down
with the person

00:34:54.550 --> 00:34:57.480
with the power of the pen.

00:34:57.480 --> 00:35:00.010
If you had a
life-threatening disease,

00:35:00.010 --> 00:35:03.610
you would not care who the
doctor was who saved your life.

00:35:03.610 --> 00:35:06.700
And I don't care who it
was who brought me out,

00:35:06.700 --> 00:35:07.930
who signed my papers.

00:35:07.930 --> 00:35:09.160
I don't care.

00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:12.130
I'm so thankful to be
sitting here looking out

00:35:12.130 --> 00:35:14.710
at this audience today.

00:35:14.710 --> 00:35:18.460
And I hope that others will get
the courage to do something,

00:35:18.460 --> 00:35:21.340
to act, and to
take this cause up,

00:35:21.340 --> 00:35:25.420
because people very lives
are dependent upon them

00:35:25.420 --> 00:35:27.410
and are dependent upon you.

00:35:27.410 --> 00:35:28.660
MALIKA SAADA SAAR: Absolutely.

00:35:28.660 --> 00:35:30.874
And it's not just about
the White House, right?

00:35:30.874 --> 00:35:32.040
ALICE JOHNSON: No, it's not.

00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:35.290
MALIKA SAADA SAAR: It
really is about how

00:35:35.290 --> 00:35:37.654
part of the war on
drugs was dehumanizing.

00:35:37.654 --> 00:35:38.570
ALICE JOHNSON: It was.

00:35:38.570 --> 00:35:39.652
It was demonized.

00:35:39.652 --> 00:35:41.860
MALIKA SAADA SAAR: Demonized
and dehumanizing, right?

00:35:41.860 --> 00:35:42.220
ALICE JOHNSON: Dehumanized.

00:35:42.220 --> 00:35:42.761
That's right.

00:35:42.761 --> 00:35:45.010
MALIKA SAADA SAAR: And we
had certain individuals,

00:35:45.010 --> 00:35:48.130
and communities,
and families seen

00:35:48.130 --> 00:35:52.580
as predators and given
sentences that were

00:35:52.580 --> 00:35:54.670
disproportional and unjust.

00:35:54.670 --> 00:35:57.340
And it seems like
so much of the work

00:35:57.340 --> 00:35:59.424
is also about changing
popular culture.

00:35:59.424 --> 00:36:00.340
ALICE JOHNSON: It has.

00:36:00.340 --> 00:36:03.180
MALIKA SAADA SAAR: Reframing
what the war on drugs

00:36:03.180 --> 00:36:03.995
really was about.

00:36:03.995 --> 00:36:05.120
ALICE JOHNSON: That's true.

00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:09.610
I believe that there should
be punishment for crime.

00:36:09.610 --> 00:36:11.290
There should be punishment.

00:36:11.290 --> 00:36:15.250
And as I've said this before,
people are quick to say,

00:36:15.250 --> 00:36:16.840
you do the crime,
you do the time.

00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:18.040
Don't cry now.

00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:20.470
But that time should
also be fair and just,

00:36:20.470 --> 00:36:23.909
based on the crime, not unjust.

00:36:23.909 --> 00:36:27.262
[APPLAUSE]

00:36:27.262 --> 00:36:31.560
So I don't believe that
the communities were

00:36:31.560 --> 00:36:35.910
safer because I spent
almost 22 years of my life

00:36:35.910 --> 00:36:39.360
behind bars-- a first-time,
non-violent offender,

00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:44.130
no criminal history, no
convictions, no trials, nothing

00:36:44.130 --> 00:36:48.330
of any kind, was a
productive member of society

00:36:48.330 --> 00:36:51.270
until that one mistake.

00:36:51.270 --> 00:36:55.110
A bad call on my part,
but it should not

00:36:55.110 --> 00:36:56.650
have cost me my life.

00:36:56.650 --> 00:36:59.610
And if it had not been
for someone having

00:36:59.610 --> 00:37:02.340
the courage, who's sitting
on my right hand right now,

00:37:02.340 --> 00:37:05.340
Kim Kardashian, to
take up my cause

00:37:05.340 --> 00:37:06.630
and go to the White House--

00:37:06.630 --> 00:37:09.490
[APPLAUSE]

00:37:09.490 --> 00:37:14.010
But I also want you to know
that, behind Kim, there

00:37:14.010 --> 00:37:18.280
is a group of advocates who are
out here today to support me.

00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:19.690
It takes that.

00:37:19.690 --> 00:37:21.310
It took them also--

00:37:21.310 --> 00:37:24.730
every little piece of every
little thing that was done

00:37:24.730 --> 00:37:28.900
was building up to what Kim
was able to go in and do.

00:37:28.900 --> 00:37:30.520
This didn't just start.

00:37:30.520 --> 00:37:32.770
People have been
fighting for me.

00:37:32.770 --> 00:37:34.640
So they're here today.

00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:36.680
Many of them are
here today, not all.

00:37:36.680 --> 00:37:39.570
So thank you, too, advocates.

00:37:39.570 --> 00:37:40.300
Thank you.

00:37:40.300 --> 00:37:40.390
MALIKA SAADA SAAR: Yes.

00:37:40.390 --> 00:37:41.230
Yes.

00:37:41.230 --> 00:37:43.187
ALICE JOHNSON:
Thank you, Google.

00:37:43.187 --> 00:37:44.770
MALIKA SAADA SAAR:
Well, a lot of what

00:37:44.770 --> 00:37:48.980
we were able to do, we could not
have done without Topeka Sam,

00:37:48.980 --> 00:37:50.738
because part of--

00:37:50.738 --> 00:37:54.084
[APPLAUSE]

00:37:55.040 --> 00:37:57.980
Part of what we were able
to do at that YouTube summit

00:37:57.980 --> 00:38:02.000
was to use a YouTube
platform that Topeka

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:04.970
figured out and taught us
how to use to bring you

00:38:04.970 --> 00:38:07.070
in from behind bars.

00:38:07.070 --> 00:38:12.050
And there was that power of
seeing you, not just hearing

00:38:12.050 --> 00:38:16.950
about your story in words, but
actually bearing witness to you

00:38:16.950 --> 00:38:20.780
in the prison jumpsuit, on
the phone, speaking to us,

00:38:20.780 --> 00:38:22.650
that was transformational.

00:38:22.650 --> 00:38:26.360
And I think for you, as well,
if her story, if Ms. Alice's

00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:31.550
story, were a written op-ed
about her life, as opposed

00:38:31.550 --> 00:38:35.415
to a digital one, it might
not have had the same impact.

00:38:35.415 --> 00:38:38.360
KIM KARDASHIAN WEST: Seeing
her face, seeing her emotions,

00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:41.220
hearing her voice--

00:38:41.220 --> 00:38:43.200
just, I remember
when Shawn Holley

00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:47.580
wrote me and had her first
phone conversation with you.

00:38:47.580 --> 00:38:50.330
She just said, you have
to hear her sweet voice.

00:38:50.330 --> 00:38:53.430
I can't wait for you to have
a phone conversation with her.

00:38:53.430 --> 00:38:54.450
And it's true.

00:38:54.450 --> 00:38:58.710
Just seeing that, seeing
your emotions just really

00:38:58.710 --> 00:39:00.374
connected with me.

00:39:00.374 --> 00:39:02.040
MALIKA SAADA SAAR: I
always talk about--

00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:03.510
I'm a human rights lawyer.

00:39:03.510 --> 00:39:06.360
And part of what you get
trained in human rights law

00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:09.240
is to document the story.

00:39:09.240 --> 00:39:12.810
You document the story of
abuse so that the world

00:39:12.810 --> 00:39:14.310
may bear witness.

00:39:14.310 --> 00:39:18.990
And part of what Topeka helped
us to do with our technology

00:39:18.990 --> 00:39:21.150
was to be able to
scale that prison

00:39:21.150 --> 00:39:24.060
wall so that we
could bear witness

00:39:24.060 --> 00:39:25.940
to what you were suffering.

00:39:25.940 --> 00:39:27.550
ALICE JOHNSON: Yes.

00:39:27.550 --> 00:39:31.330
My voice was free,
my face was free,

00:39:31.330 --> 00:39:33.250
my image was free
before I was free.

00:39:33.250 --> 00:39:33.875
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:39:33.875 --> 00:39:34.230
MALIKA SAADA SAAR: That's right.

00:39:34.230 --> 00:39:34.920
AUDIENCE: Wow.

00:39:34.920 --> 00:39:36.253
MALIKA SAADA SAAR: That's right.

00:39:36.253 --> 00:39:39.267
[APPLAUSE]

00:39:44.185 --> 00:39:46.730
So we've recognized
how Google has

00:39:46.730 --> 00:39:51.530
played a small, but important
role in your freedom.

00:39:51.530 --> 00:39:56.780
But Ms. Alice, you called
on us from behind bars.

00:39:56.780 --> 00:40:00.410
You called on us, as a
company, to take action

00:40:00.410 --> 00:40:01.762
and to take responsibility.

00:40:01.762 --> 00:40:02.170
ALICE JOHNSON: Yes.

00:40:02.170 --> 00:40:03.211
MALIKA SAADA SAAR: Right?

00:40:03.211 --> 00:40:07.850
And you said to us, to whom
much is given, much is required.

00:40:07.850 --> 00:40:11.630
And Kim, you are living
out that notion of to whom

00:40:11.630 --> 00:40:14.900
much is given, much is
required in your activism

00:40:14.900 --> 00:40:17.010
for justice reform.

00:40:17.010 --> 00:40:22.220
I want to know from
both of you, what more

00:40:22.220 --> 00:40:26.600
can tech do around the
issue of justice reform?

00:40:29.140 --> 00:40:32.200
KIM KARDASHIAN WEST: Just
seeing videos like that

00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:35.140
and putting it out
there on social media--

00:40:35.140 --> 00:40:36.790
I mean, I do get
how social media

00:40:36.790 --> 00:40:40.030
can be very mentally
challenging at times

00:40:40.030 --> 00:40:42.320
when you see a
lot of negativity.

00:40:42.320 --> 00:40:45.340
But if I were to take
in all the negativity

00:40:45.340 --> 00:40:50.050
that I've received over
the decade of me being

00:40:50.050 --> 00:40:55.480
in the business to that moment
where I saw Alice's video,

00:40:55.480 --> 00:40:56.990
it's all worth it.

00:40:56.990 --> 00:40:59.755
So I think, you know, it's true.

00:40:59.755 --> 00:41:01.060
[APPLAUSE]

00:41:01.930 --> 00:41:04.540
I think social
media's very powerful.

00:41:04.540 --> 00:41:06.070
And it's just like anything.

00:41:06.070 --> 00:41:10.310
If you take it in doses and if
you use it in the right way--

00:41:10.310 --> 00:41:13.420
I've been able to connect
with so many people

00:41:13.420 --> 00:41:14.680
over social media.

00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:17.960
And I'm so grateful for it.

00:41:17.960 --> 00:41:23.550
So I think if people could
just share more and share

00:41:23.550 --> 00:41:26.070
their stories more--
even seeing in the video

00:41:26.070 --> 00:41:28.950
that you guys posted of
the love letters, I think,

00:41:28.950 --> 00:41:32.220
that John Legend
was sharing, was so

00:41:32.220 --> 00:41:36.450
touching because so many
people are affected by it,

00:41:36.450 --> 00:41:38.610
people that you
wouldn't even imagine.

00:41:38.610 --> 00:41:39.651
MALIKA SAADA SAAR: Mm-hm.

00:41:39.651 --> 00:41:41.280
That's so True.

00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:44.940
ALICE JOHNSON: I don't think
Googlers who are here today

00:41:44.940 --> 00:41:47.790
really realize the role
that this company played

00:41:47.790 --> 00:41:48.470
in my freedom.

00:41:48.470 --> 00:41:49.740
Are they aware of the
role that they played?

00:41:49.740 --> 00:41:51.490
MALIKA SAADA SAAR: You
talk more about it.

00:41:51.490 --> 00:41:52.266
ALICE JOHNSON: OK.

00:41:52.266 --> 00:41:53.664
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:54.600 --> 00:41:58.910
The Google event that I spoke
at that was Skyped out--

00:41:58.910 --> 00:42:01.680
a person who was sitting
in the audience saw me.

00:42:01.680 --> 00:42:02.880
MALIKA SAADA SAAR: I have to
say we did it on a YouTube

00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:04.629
platform, because I'll
get in trouble if I

00:42:04.629 --> 00:42:05.892
allow you to say "Skype."

00:42:05.892 --> 00:42:06.384
ALICE JOHNSON: OK.

00:42:06.384 --> 00:42:06.884
OK.

00:42:06.884 --> 00:42:10.320
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:12.668
Anyway, I just want you
to know that Google--

00:42:12.668 --> 00:42:14.340
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:14.340 --> 00:42:17.970
I just want you to know
that Google did play a role

00:42:17.970 --> 00:42:20.550
as a catalyst for my freedom.

00:42:20.550 --> 00:42:22.130
So thank you.

00:42:22.130 --> 00:42:23.490
You've welcomed me here today.

00:42:23.490 --> 00:42:26.940
But I want to tell you,
Google, I love you, Google.

00:42:26.940 --> 00:42:29.040
I love you, Googlers.

00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:31.650
I think it's OK to say that.

00:42:31.650 --> 00:42:35.150
[APPLAUSE]

00:42:36.270 --> 00:42:38.520
Without telling the
whole story, just

00:42:38.520 --> 00:42:40.170
know that you were a catalyst.

00:42:40.170 --> 00:42:43.050
You played a role in my freedom.

00:42:43.050 --> 00:42:44.640
And today, I was
able to meet some

00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:47.640
of the behind-the-scene people
at Google who played a role

00:42:47.640 --> 00:42:48.790
and give them a hug.

00:42:48.790 --> 00:42:53.130
And I want to give all
of you a virtual hug now.

00:42:53.130 --> 00:42:55.170
Those who I have
not seen, some--

00:42:55.170 --> 00:42:57.690
I know this has
been live-streamed--

00:42:57.690 --> 00:43:00.540
I'm very grateful to the
role that Google played

00:43:00.540 --> 00:43:04.050
in my being a free woman today.

00:43:04.050 --> 00:43:07.080
And technology is so-- to
get back to what you said--

00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:10.110
technology-- had that
technology been in place--

00:43:10.110 --> 00:43:11.790
it was my timing.

00:43:11.790 --> 00:43:13.710
It was the exact time.

00:43:13.710 --> 00:43:17.290
When I went into prison,
there was no social media.

00:43:17.290 --> 00:43:18.430
There was no Facebook.

00:43:18.430 --> 00:43:20.620
There was no internet.

00:43:20.620 --> 00:43:24.060
So my understanding
now of just how big

00:43:24.060 --> 00:43:26.940
this is, to have all
of these followers--

00:43:26.940 --> 00:43:29.231
I have some
followers myself now.

00:43:29.231 --> 00:43:31.155
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:31.155 --> 00:43:34.522
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]

00:43:36.940 --> 00:43:39.190
To understand how this works--

00:43:39.190 --> 00:43:41.740
and one follower can have--

00:43:41.740 --> 00:43:44.910
just one follower can
have a lot of followers,

00:43:44.910 --> 00:43:49.820
who have a lot of followers,
who can get this message out.

00:43:49.820 --> 00:43:53.110
So technology
plays a huge role--

00:43:53.110 --> 00:43:55.880
now that I know something
about technology--

00:43:55.880 --> 00:44:00.010
it plays a huge role in
getting the message out.

00:44:00.010 --> 00:44:02.250
It played a role in my freedom.

00:44:02.250 --> 00:44:05.530
And it's going to play,
it is going to play,

00:44:05.530 --> 00:44:07.393
a big role in the
freedom of others.

00:44:07.393 --> 00:44:08.059
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:44:08.059 --> 00:44:08.548
ALICE JOHNSON: Right.

00:44:08.548 --> 00:44:09.214
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:44:09.214 --> 00:44:11.971
[APPLAUSE]

00:44:15.014 --> 00:44:17.180
MALIKA SAADA SAAR: Are there
any other parting words

00:44:17.180 --> 00:44:19.820
of wisdom that you
want to give us?

00:44:19.820 --> 00:44:21.410
You, Kim?

00:44:21.410 --> 00:44:22.410
KIM KARDASHIAN WEST: No.

00:44:22.410 --> 00:44:27.120
I'm just-- I'm grateful for the
opportunity to be here today

00:44:27.120 --> 00:44:29.850
and to sit next to Ms. Alice.

00:44:29.850 --> 00:44:32.970
It's always so amazing
to get to see her family.

00:44:32.970 --> 00:44:37.530
And that's what we're fighting
for-- is for more people

00:44:37.530 --> 00:44:40.950
to get the opportunities
to see, and touch, and be

00:44:40.950 --> 00:44:42.436
with their loved ones again.

00:44:42.436 --> 00:44:43.311
ALICE JOHNSON: Mm-hm.

00:44:43.311 --> 00:44:43.810
Absolutely.

00:44:43.810 --> 00:44:46.320
ALICE JOHNSON: My parting
words to the audience

00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:51.360
here is that one person
can make a difference.

00:44:51.360 --> 00:44:53.386
That one person could be you.

00:44:53.386 --> 00:44:54.378
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:44:54.378 --> 00:44:55.866
MALIKA SAADA SAAR: Thank you.

00:44:55.866 --> 00:44:57.354
Thank you.

00:44:57.354 --> 00:45:00.826
[APPLAUSE]

00:45:03.895 --> 00:45:07.280
Well, I want to
end with gratitude.

00:45:07.280 --> 00:45:10.840
I'm so grateful to
you for showing us

00:45:10.840 --> 00:45:13.810
the best of who we
are, as a company

00:45:13.810 --> 00:45:18.070
I'm so grateful for how
you have been through hell

00:45:18.070 --> 00:45:23.560
and back and always insisted
on dignity and grace.

00:45:23.560 --> 00:45:25.935
I am grateful to you
for that example.

00:45:25.935 --> 00:45:27.310
ALICE JOHNSON:
Thank you, Malika.

00:45:27.310 --> 00:45:29.351
MALIKA SAADA SAAR: And I
am grateful to you, Kim,

00:45:29.351 --> 00:45:33.520
for your courage
to be an activist,

00:45:33.520 --> 00:45:38.500
to be able to be a voice
against the over-criminalization

00:45:38.500 --> 00:45:41.150
of our families and
our communities.

00:45:41.150 --> 00:45:42.120
Thank you.

00:45:42.120 --> 00:45:47.080
It is an example that you set
that we all have to adhere to

00:45:47.080 --> 00:45:49.030
and recognize.

00:45:49.030 --> 00:45:51.250
And I also want to
express gratitude

00:45:51.250 --> 00:45:55.150
not only to this remarkable
community of Googlers

00:45:55.150 --> 00:45:59.560
that I'm honored to be part of,
but some particular Googlers

00:45:59.560 --> 00:46:03.550
who are part of the Justice
for Everyone team that helped

00:46:03.550 --> 00:46:06.160
make this day happen.

00:46:06.160 --> 00:46:10.390
And a special shout-out
and love to Charniece Huff,

00:46:10.390 --> 00:46:14.314
who pulls together this team.

00:46:14.314 --> 00:46:17.100
[APPLAUSE]

00:46:17.100 --> 00:46:19.760
For those of you who
want to help us continue

00:46:19.760 --> 00:46:24.620
the work around insisting on
justice reform and Google's

00:46:24.620 --> 00:46:26.930
role towards that, I
hope that you will be

00:46:26.930 --> 00:46:29.930
part of Justice for Everyone.

00:46:29.930 --> 00:46:35.060
I'm going to ask Maab Ibrahim
from .org to come up here.

00:46:35.060 --> 00:46:40.250
And as she comes up here, I want
us to also recognize that part

00:46:40.250 --> 00:46:45.020
of the work that we have done
at Google to disrupt the human

00:46:45.020 --> 00:46:50.120
costs of mass incarceration
is also the work of .org,

00:46:50.120 --> 00:46:52.760
and the leadership of
Jacquelline Fuller,

00:46:52.760 --> 00:46:56.520
and Justin Steele
to be able to--

00:46:56.520 --> 00:47:00.020
[APPLAUSE]

00:47:03.290 --> 00:47:08.600
--commit to $35 million in
funding to justice reform

00:47:08.600 --> 00:47:11.870
organizations, and
also to make clear

00:47:11.870 --> 00:47:14.940
that this is part of
who we are at Google.

00:47:14.940 --> 00:47:17.660
So I want to thank them,
as part of my gratitude

00:47:17.660 --> 00:47:20.510
for your leadership as well.

00:47:20.510 --> 00:47:22.410
With that, thank you, everyone.

00:47:22.410 --> 00:47:25.070
And Maab, if you can come join?

00:47:25.070 --> 00:47:28.420
[APPLAUSE]
