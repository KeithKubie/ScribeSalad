00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.460
We have this one that was actually published
in The New York Times

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:06.569
and you can see all the airbrushing all over it.

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:09.840
During the Live Q&amp;A, we can even take this out and look at it from the front and the back

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:10.920
which is really great.

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.410
Hi, I'm Sarah Meister.

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:16.529
I'm a curator here in the Department of Photography
at The Museum of Modern Art.

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.439
And we're here in our collection storage space
which is super cold

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:22.410
which is why I'm wearing a parka.

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:28.100
Over the last few months, we've been doing
a new Live Q&amp;A series on MoMA's YouTube channel.

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:32.860
So since May is National Photography Month, we thought it would be fun to do one about photography

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.800
We're going to explore lots of questions coming
from you

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.420
but some of them might have to do with:

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.320
Why is it so cold here in the collection storage?

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.110
Or how do we select what prints we put on the walls?

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:48.170
How do we choose which print if we have more than one from a given negative?

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.860
Or why do analog photos matter in the digital era?

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.420
We'll answer both questions and I hope a whole
lot more.

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.710
You can leave them in the little comments
section below.

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:04.140
And of course, you can submit them live on
Wednesday, May 23 at 3:00 p.m. New York time.

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.040
We also thought it would be fun to pull out
a few photographs

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.240
by some of your favorite photographers

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.620
so please list those in the comments section
as well

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.700
and we'll pick a few of those to share with
everyone.

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.100
So until then, enjoy these videos on MoMA's
YouTube channel

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.020
and be sure to subscribe so you get an alert
when we go live.
