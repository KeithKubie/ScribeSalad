00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.010
To round things out, let's double-check the subtleties of your understanding of

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:07.658
inverse functions. I've written a bunch of statements here and I'd like you to

00:00:07.658 --> 00:00:11.670
tell me which ones are true. Now, we may not have talked explicitly about every

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.883
single one of these. So, think about each of them carefully, and if you need to

00:00:15.883 --> 00:00:20.452
try more than once, that is completely fine, as always. You can check off as

00:00:20.452 --> 00:00:24.766
man as you want to, even all of them, if you think that that's appropriate. So

00:00:24.766 --> 00:00:30.045
here are your choices. All functions have inverses. All inverse functions have

00:00:30.045 --> 00:00:34.880
inverses. A functions domain can influence whether or not it has an inverse.

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:39.911
All functions pass the vertical and horizontal line tests. And lastly, all

00:00:39.911 --> 00:00:44.269
inverse functions pass the vertical and horizontal line tests.
