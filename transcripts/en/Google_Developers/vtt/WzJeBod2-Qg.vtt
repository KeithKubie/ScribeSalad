CHRIS MESSINA: Hello,
everybody.

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:04.800
My name is Chris Messina.

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.880
I am a UX designer on the
Google+ platform team.

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.490
I'm joined by Paul Lindner
who is a tech lead on

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:13.880
the platform team.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:16.600
For those of you who don't know,
Paul is very famous.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.040
He's a co inventor of Gopher.

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.210
And for you youngsters in the
room, I will spare you the

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:23.380
task of looking up.

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:25.320
It was very, very,
very important.

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.310
So you should all be very
impressed with the stuff that

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:29.900
Paul's going to tell
you today.

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.970
Also for those of you who are
here in the room today

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:36.270
wondering why my hair's not dark
and why I'm not a little

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.810
shorter, because I am not
Chris Messina the actor.

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:41.640
So I can sign autographs,
but it's not

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:42.590
going to be worth anything.

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.450
So if that's the guy you're
looking for you can

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:47.300
quietly exit now.

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:48.710
I won't be offended.

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.730
Happens all the time, in some
ways because of the things

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:53.660
that we're going to talk
to you about today.

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.680
So as you guys probably know,
Google is all about getting

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.700
the right content to the right
people at the right time in

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.230
the right place and with all
the right context and all

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:08.260
these things.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.300
We also care deeply
about publishers.

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.210
We care about the content
that you create.

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:15.620
We care about your ability to
get that content to people who

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:17.630
are interested in
that content.

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.180
We think about all
the time that you

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:20.850
put into that content.

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.740
And we always are thinking about
new ways of actually

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.770
introducing that stuff to people
when they are most open

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.320
to and interested
in seeing it.

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.960
In a sense, you could think of
us as a content matchmaker.

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:38.490
But we're at an interesting
crossroads.

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.110
There's a problem.

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.270
The way that people get,
consume, interact with and ask

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:49.300
for information is changing.

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:51.270
People's behaviors
are changing.

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.370
There are new types of devices
coming out all the time.

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:54.550
We've seen that.

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:59.150
So we need to work together
Google, publishers, people who

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:01.230
put things on the web, people
who create things for the

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:04.530
internet, people who create
apps, to solve what I think is

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.620
going to be an increasingly
interesting and very, very

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:12.350
challenging problem for all of
us in order to create better

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.960
content experiences
for people.

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.630
In other words, what worked in
1998 when Google got its

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.530
start, essentially mapping
the web, mapping all the

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.280
relationships sort of like the
original latent fuzzy social

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.610
network that was out there.

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.340
That doesn't really work
that well anymore.

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.950
It works pretty well for us, and
it works pretty well sort

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.060
of in general.

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.130
But I think increasingly the
way that people ask for

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.480
information is becoming
less specific.

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.860
People are constantly
interacting with computing

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.520
devices that don't have
keyboards, so they're asking

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.910
for things without as much
context, or without as many

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.380
words as they used to look at.

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.140
We know that, for example, query
lengths are actually

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.840
becoming shorter and smaller
because people are doing more

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.410
and more searches on their
mobile phones.

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.460
So given all that context and
given that behavior change,

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:02.180
how do we still deliver content
to people with less

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.510
information coming from people
about their requests?

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.650
In other words, before, we used
to be able to look at

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.270
those input strings that people
would type into Google

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:13.840
and then make a bunch of
assumptions both about the

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.430
input as well as about your
content to make those

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.080
connections come together.

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.010
But now that there's so much
content on the web, now

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.280
there's so much information out
there, we need to start

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.680
becoming more precise.

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.660
This is actually one of the
reasons why Google+ exists.

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.320
Google previously didn't have
a very strong notion of a

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:33.650
person, nor of a person and
their relationships.

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:35.790
We were able to extract
different types of information

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.550
from different contexts.

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:41.180
But we actually needed more help
from people to tell us

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.690
who were the most important
people to them in terms of

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:45.540
people in their photos, the
people they send messages to,

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:46.890
the people that they
interact with and

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:47.830
put into their circles.

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:50.420
This is very, very important
information that allows us to

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:53.110
create better experiences for
people that create deeper

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:55.400
lasting relationships.

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.020
We also need more context about
the things that people

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:59.320
are interacting with
in the world.

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:00.810
And we need more context
about the

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:02.720
content that you're producing.

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.440
So as a designer, this is what's
really exciting to me

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:07.800
about where the web is going.

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.070
With things like schema.org, all
the different markup that

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:12.350
we're able to put out there
with the moments API and a

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:14.240
bunch of stuff that Paul's going
to talk about, we're

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:16.579
able to get much more precise
to deliver much better

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:17.829
experiences to people.

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:23.250
And some of those experiences
include the new Maps that you

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.670
saw today, where you're able to
search for things like show

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:29.760
me things near where I am now
and it makes assumptions and

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:33.060
is able to deliver very precise
solutions to you.

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:34.280
Things like self-driving cars.

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:35.960
We know so much about the
world because of the

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:40.220
structured data that a lot of
companies have been producing

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:41.560
over the last couple years.

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.000
With things like Now and
anticipatory search, we're

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.530
able to deliver stuff to
people before they

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:46.920
know they need it.

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:49.050
And we're able to deliver things
with interfaces that

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:53.770
are like OK Glass or OK Google
and we're able to deliver

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:56.410
stuff to them that could
be your content.

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:59.340
So with that sort of background,
I'm going to turn

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.530
it over to Paul who is going to
give you much more specific

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:04.470
information and ideas about how
you can add more markup,

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:07.270
make better connections between
Google and your sites

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:08.660
to help your content.

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:10.040
It's the right people
at the right time

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:11.570
in the right context.

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:12.920
PAUL LINDNER: Thanks, Chris.

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:16.690
Thanks for that really inspiring
explanation of why

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:18.110
this really matters.

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:20.710
And by the way, you're also much
more than just the same

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:22.800
name as an actor.

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.460
CHRIS MESSINA: No.

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:25.540
PAUL LINDNER: This is
the guy who actually

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:27.290
brought us the hashtag.

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:28.570
CHRIS MESSINA: I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:32.950
PAUL LINDNER: For good or
for bad, it's his fault.

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:36.470
But anyway, I'm an engineer
on the Google+ platform.

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:39.400
I really care about
content and tools.

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.360
And every day when I get up in
the morning, I think of these

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:44.440
three things.

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:47.120
Number one is, how can I make
tools that make your job

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:52.090
easier and make it easier for
publishers to do cool things?

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:55.980
How can we make tools and
systems that are meaningful?

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:59.170
That deliver value to you, the
publisher, but also to your

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:01.610
users and Google's users?

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:04.780
And also, the one final thing--
and this is something

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:08.940
Chris cares about a lot, too
being a designer-- is, we want

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:11.950
you to really look
good on Google.

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:15.200
And the reason is that
you have the content.

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:18.010
You have users and consumers
of content.

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:20.870
And a lot of times, people
find it on Google for the

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:21.340
first time.

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:25.070
This is where they come
to discover it.

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:27.550
And we want to make sure that
you make a really good first

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:27.990
impression.

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:32.830
We want to make sure that your
content is going to shine.

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:36.590
So now I'm going to go back to
1998, I guess, which is when

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:38.830
Google came out.

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:40.810
Back then, websites were
a little simpler.

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:42.060
We're going to look at something
where content didn't

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:44.310
really shine.

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:47.430
So, back in 1998, your website
might have looked

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:48.360
a little like this.

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:51.210
Well, maybe if you were in
the garage making it.

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:54.070
But back then, HTML tags
were uppercase.

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:58.410
The blink tag was considered
maybe kind of a cool idea, and

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:01.320
frames were just sort of there
from the beginning.

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:05.330
So we're going to actually try
and make this site look good.

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:09.030
Because your first impression
that users see might actually

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:12.020
kind of look like this if you
don't do the right stuff.

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:13.810
So let's jump right in.

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:18.980
So the first thing that we did
it on the Google+ platform was

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:22.550
to offer a way for users
to recommend content.

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:26.230
And the way that they do
that is the +1 button.

00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:29.620
So the +1 button is really kind
of the first place you

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:30.090
want to start.

00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:33.770
It's sort of the first
place we started.

00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:36.910
Let's actually look at adding
it to our nice little pretty

00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:40.240
site-- well, maybe
not so pretty.

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:41.810
So to do that--

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:44.730
and how many people here have
actually added a +1 button to

00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:45.620
their site?

00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:46.700
A lot.

00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:48.380
So most people you can just
sort of ignore this part.

00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:49.960
But, anyway, just
keep with me.

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:51.440
It's actually really useful.

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:52.570
You'll find a few tips.

00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:56.070
But the first example here you
can see is our +1 JavaScript.

00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:58.950
And back in 1998 JavaScript--

00:07:58.950 --> 00:08:00.590
was it even there?

00:08:00.590 --> 00:08:02.640
Anyway, it was kind
of a novelty.

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:05.690
But now it really powers
our entire platform.

00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:08.970
And once you have Google's
JavaScript in your page then

00:08:08.970 --> 00:08:10.391
there's all kinds of interesting
things that are

00:08:10.391 --> 00:08:11.210
going to happen.

00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:15.320
So the easy way is you could do
something like the piece of

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:17.470
script above, where you
actually just add a

00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:18.610
line to your head.

00:08:18.610 --> 00:08:21.890
We'd actually prefer if you
use the second example.

00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:22.770
Why?

00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:27.040
Because it's an asynchronous
loading of the JavaScript.

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:29.440
Basically, we don't want
to get in the way of

00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:30.950
users seeing your site.

00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:34.980
We just want to get in there
in the background, and then

00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:37.690
enhance it after there
is interactive stuff.

00:08:37.690 --> 00:08:37.929
CHRIS MESSINA: To be
clear, these are

00:08:37.929 --> 00:08:38.809
two different options.

00:08:38.809 --> 00:08:39.010
PAUL LINDNER: Yeah.

00:08:39.010 --> 00:08:40.020
CHRIS MESSINA: I can
choose one or the

00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:41.080
other, but not both.

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:41.539
PAUL LINDNER: Right.

00:08:41.539 --> 00:08:43.690
CHRIS MESSINA: OK.

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:45.570
PAUL LINDNER: So we've added
that to your site, we've

00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:48.708
unlocked the potential, so
let's add that +1 button.

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:52.030
[SQUEAKING NOISE]

00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:53.760
PAUL LINDNER: Now we have
a black screen.

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:56.450
So let's just suffice to say
that you can add a +1 button

00:08:56.450 --> 00:09:00.500
to your site and it will be
very, very easy with a div tag

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:01.660
on your site.

00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:04.010
So, we're having some technical
difficulties but

00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:05.210
we'll just skip right ahead.

00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:08.460
So once you have the +1 button
on your site and users are

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:10.370
starting to click on it,
you're going to see

00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:12.590
that count go up.

00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:17.540
And when users visit your site
and they actually see popular

00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:19.900
content, that's a big
draw for them.

00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:23.390
That's a signal that there's
something going on here.

00:09:23.390 --> 00:09:26.200
And if you use the form of the
+1 button with annotations,

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:28.840
you may even see that their
friends have been there.

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:33.260
But we want to make sure that
your +1's are going to count.

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:36.910
So what does that mean?

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:39.430
Our little demo site, we
actually have a problem here.

00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:43.670
We have two URLs because
people were misspelling

00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:46.570
viewsorcerers, with
a u versus an a.

00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:48.250
So can anyone tell me what
the difference is

00:09:48.250 --> 00:09:49.500
between these two URLs?

00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:54.090
CHRIS MESSINA: The u?

00:09:54.090 --> 00:09:54.680
PAUL LINDNER: A u.

00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:55.760
CHRIS MESSINA: A u.

00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:58.150
PAUL LINDNER: But also 21 +1s.

00:09:58.150 --> 00:10:00.860
So the count should really be
39, but instead we have a

00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:03.520
count of nine and
a count of 30.

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:07.130
And I just want to really
stress the importance of

00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:08.960
proper URL management.

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:13.150
When Chris mentioned things like
the names of things on

00:10:13.150 --> 00:10:15.300
the internet, well, URLs
are the names of

00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:16.520
things on the internet.

00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:19.800
And there's a relatively simple
thing you can do, which

00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:25.230
is add a rel=canonical tag to
the head of your documents.

00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:27.550
And then you can see in this
example that we've said that

00:10:27.550 --> 00:10:33.120
this page, this document,
should be at this URL.

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:35.290
And that will ensure
that the count is

00:10:35.290 --> 00:10:37.830
properly added together.

00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:39.890
CHRIS MESSINA: So what you're
saying is if I have two URLs

00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:44.460
for the same content but this
rel=canonical thing doesn't

00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:50.790
exist, I won't get full credit
with Google or with my readers

00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:52.480
in terms of these counts.

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:54.690
PAUL LINDNER: Exactly.

00:10:54.690 --> 00:10:58.420
That would be the one really
good tip that you could take

00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:01.440
away with you from this talk
is make sure that your +1's

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:02.430
are going to count.

00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:05.410
Because when users actually
interact with that content,

00:11:05.410 --> 00:11:08.820
maybe by taking the URL and in
the address bar and pasting it

00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:11.350
into Google+, that
counts as well.

00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:13.860
When people +1 it in the stream,
when they comment on

00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:15.550
it, that counts too.

00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:19.370
So getting this right is key
to making sure that you get

00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:20.620
all the credit.

00:11:24.730 --> 00:11:25.400
It's the page.

00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:26.650
It's the URL of the page.

00:11:26.650 --> 00:11:28.590
And we can go over this
in questions.

00:11:32.990 --> 00:11:34.420
There might be a typo
in this slide.

00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:36.080
We apologize for that.

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:38.150
So let's move right on.

00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:40.325
Let's talk about the stream
in this case.

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:47.440
When you've actually typed the
URL and shared it, your user

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:48.690
sees something like this.

00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:53.930
Chris, can you tell me what's
wrong with this?

00:11:53.930 --> 00:11:54.805
CHRIS MESSINA: It looks awful.

00:11:54.805 --> 00:11:56.565
That's not what my website
looks like.

00:11:56.565 --> 00:11:57.470
PAUL LINDNER: No.

00:11:57.470 --> 00:11:59.090
So this is the first impression
that some

00:11:59.090 --> 00:12:00.560
people might see.

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:05.030
If you have various images on
your site and then text, be

00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:08.420
Google does a very good job of
trying to figure out what your

00:12:08.420 --> 00:12:10.920
site is about and the
content there.

00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:15.290
But oftentimes you can help it
out a hell of a lot better.

00:12:15.290 --> 00:12:18.440
Because in this case, we don't
want the spinning image GIF.

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:19.670
We want the actual title.

00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:22.010
So let's look at what it could
really look like if we put a

00:12:22.010 --> 00:12:24.400
little effort into it.

00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:27.190
In this case, we actually
have a much better

00:12:27.190 --> 00:12:28.460
share into the stream.

00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:30.520
We have a title, we've
got an image.

00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:33.620
So what are we looking
for here?

00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:35.290
We want to maximize the
amount of pixels.

00:12:35.290 --> 00:12:37.750
So when you're looking at that
new beautiful showroom

00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:42.270
experience, you're going to get
125 pixels across to fill.

00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:46.270
If you make a nice square image
with that size, you're

00:12:46.270 --> 00:12:49.860
going to get a much better
item in the stream.

00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:53.000
And you probably also want to
consider doubling that,

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.050
because you're going to get a
much nicer look on that brand

00:12:57.050 --> 00:13:00.000
new Chromebook Pixel that you're
going to get, or other

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.070
high definition devices.

00:13:02.070 --> 00:13:04.270
And at the same time, you also
want to maximize the title

00:13:04.270 --> 00:13:06.390
because the titles are
going to be popping

00:13:06.390 --> 00:13:08.080
out much more now.

00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:11.540
So include something really
relevant for that.

00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:12.950
how do you do this?

00:13:12.950 --> 00:13:16.080
Well, it's actually
quite easy.

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:18.550
Google supports schema.org.

00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:21.400
And it's a standard that's
been around for a while.

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:25.620
But it helps you tell
Google what is

00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:27.490
important in your page.

00:13:27.490 --> 00:13:33.960
So in this case we've tagged the
existing HTML with a name

00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:38.910
and an image that we want
to use for sharing.

00:13:38.910 --> 00:13:39.990
We can also add a description.

00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:42.380
There's other things too.

00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:45.250
That's a very simple
schema.org example.

00:13:45.250 --> 00:13:49.420
Let's look at something that's
a little bit more complex.

00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:52.790
In this case schema.org can
actually represent something

00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:55.020
very complex.

00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:57.980
It's a music album which
actually has a number of

00:13:57.980 --> 00:13:59.320
different properties.

00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:00.930
You have tracks.

00:14:00.930 --> 00:14:03.470
You have a musical group.

00:14:03.470 --> 00:14:05.210
You've got a recording.

00:14:05.210 --> 00:14:09.610
All of these entities can be
represented in schema.org.

00:14:09.610 --> 00:14:11.926
that looks a little complex,
don't you think?

00:14:11.926 --> 00:14:12.860
CHRIS MESSINA: Yeah.

00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:14.470
PAUL LINDNER: Chris says yes.

00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:15.260
Remember at the beginning--

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:17.830
I really want to help make
it easy for you.

00:14:17.830 --> 00:14:21.530
So Google actually has a tool
that's called the Structured

00:14:21.530 --> 00:14:25.300
Data Testing Tool found at
the URL you see below.

00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:28.280
And this tool will help
you verify that

00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:29.530
you've got it right.

00:14:29.530 --> 00:14:32.600
You can put in the URL of your
site or any HTML that you

00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:33.820
might be editing at the time.

00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:38.050
Just cut and paste
and preview it.

00:14:38.050 --> 00:14:40.420
So now that you've got some
tools that we can use, let's

00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:43.750
look at how we can actually make
your site even better.

00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:46.160
How many people here saw
Vic's demo at the

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:48.930
keynote here with relateds.

00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:49.340
Yeah?

00:14:49.340 --> 00:14:52.730
That was pretty cool, huh?

00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:56.290
Now, the great thing about
relateds is it's another way

00:14:56.290 --> 00:15:00.170
that users can get
to your content.

00:15:00.170 --> 00:15:02.680
And it's done via hash tags.

00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:03.900
I think you kind of
like those, right?

00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:04.730
CHRIS MESSINA: I do.

00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:06.560
PAUL LINDNER: He does.

00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:11.180
but the question is it's based
on the content of the page and

00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:14.970
the post, so what can we do to
actually influence them?

00:15:14.970 --> 00:15:16.270
Well you can.

00:15:16.270 --> 00:15:21.160
And again, we're going to go
back to schema.org to do it.

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:26.320
Here is an example
of how to do it.

00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:29.020
The main things you need to take
away from this are you

00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:34.530
need to choose a schema.org type
that is of creative work,

00:15:34.530 --> 00:15:38.240
because it has an
about property.

00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:43.110
The about property can tell you
that this document, this

00:15:43.110 --> 00:15:46.570
entity, is about
another entity.

00:15:46.570 --> 00:15:52.240
And there's a new tag that's
just been announced and it's

00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:55.380
actually still in progress a
little bit in the W3C working

00:15:55.380 --> 00:15:57.580
group but it's called sameAs.

00:15:57.580 --> 00:16:01.000
And in this case we have a
couple of examples of linking

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.480
this content to a different
entity.

00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:09.110
So the way you do that
is by using a URL.

00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:11.730
And It could be any URL.

00:16:11.730 --> 00:16:14.760
It could be a Wikipedia URL.

00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:18.610
it could be a IMDB URL,
if it's a movie.

00:16:18.610 --> 00:16:22.090
It could be anything
you really want

00:16:22.090 --> 00:16:23.040
that's something stable.

00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:25.700
But we're going to choose
a Freebase URL.

00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:30.470
Is everyone here familiar
with Freebase?

00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:33.520
I don't see any hands, so I'm
going to tell you a little bit

00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:33.880
about Freebase.

00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:36.470
So how many people here know
about knowledge cards?

00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:39.090
You've seen them in
search, right?

00:16:39.090 --> 00:16:41.260
I'm pretty sure there's
a bunch of nods here.

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:45.290
So Freebase is the database
of entities that is

00:16:45.290 --> 00:16:46.920
maintained by Google.

00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:49.120
So they have an entry
for pretty much

00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:50.730
everything that there is.

00:16:50.730 --> 00:16:58.330
Songs music, books, even just
abstract concepts like irony

00:16:58.330 --> 00:17:00.690
or public speaking.

00:17:00.690 --> 00:17:03.570
So in this case we've chosen
two different URLs.

00:17:03.570 --> 00:17:08.220
The Freebase URL above is
a link to electro pop.

00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:09.650
It's a topic.

00:17:09.650 --> 00:17:11.540
And the second one
is a link to a

00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:13.680
specific song on Wikipedia.

00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:19.220
So what this means is, when
Google looks at this content

00:17:19.220 --> 00:17:21.970
it was able to understand
that this content

00:17:21.970 --> 00:17:24.049
is about these topics.

00:17:24.049 --> 00:17:28.770
And that is what it uses to
build those amazing hashtags.

00:17:28.770 --> 00:17:33.710
And the net benefit for you is
that your content can now be

00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:36.030
seen in more places.

00:17:36.030 --> 00:17:40.610
CHRIS MESSINA: Let me look for
a little context for this.

00:17:40.610 --> 00:17:46.290
When I first started using the
hashtag in 2007, I basically

00:17:46.290 --> 00:17:49.570
needed a way to tag
conversations that were going

00:17:49.570 --> 00:17:51.960
on on that network, right?

00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:52.990
There was no way to do it.

00:17:52.990 --> 00:17:57.230
A lot of people wanted us to
create these groups, these

00:17:57.230 --> 00:17:58.570
places that people
would go to have

00:17:58.570 --> 00:18:00.090
conversations about things.

00:18:00.090 --> 00:18:02.180
And I was really lazy.

00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:03.200
So I was like, well look.

00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:04.170
I've got a phone.

00:18:04.170 --> 00:18:05.480
I've got SMS.

00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:08.300
I want to be able to label my
content when I'm on the go and

00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:09.700
not even have to
think about it.

00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:13.500
So you guys go do your thing,
I'll do my thing and I'll just

00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:16.190
put this little pound symbol in
front of these words, and

00:18:16.190 --> 00:18:17.640
those are my tags
on my content.

00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:19.980
That's how I tell you what
this stuff is about.

00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:21.265
And everybody thought
I was stupid.

00:18:21.265 --> 00:18:22.990
And everybody thought it
looked really bad.

00:18:22.990 --> 00:18:25.320
And they were right, but
it didn't matter

00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:27.480
because it was so easy.

00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:29.130
The thing that's really
interesting about what Paul is

00:18:29.130 --> 00:18:31.100
saying is actually twofold.

00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:34.890
First, within Google+, to
succeed at the game of

00:18:34.890 --> 00:18:39.740
Google+, you need to create
great original content that's

00:18:39.740 --> 00:18:41.300
valuable and interesting.

00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:43.920
However, if you don't have a
great number of followers on

00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:46.750
Google+ yet, one way that you
can actually get those

00:18:46.750 --> 00:18:50.430
followers is by producing that
content and tagging it with

00:18:50.430 --> 00:18:52.620
stuff that's actually related to
what you're writing about.

00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:55.460
That way, people that are
popular, like Paul--

00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:58.280
when he shares stuff if someone
clicks on one of those

00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:01.235
related hash tags and they're
browsing through all the 15,

00:19:01.235 --> 00:19:03.710
16 different posts that are
coming in that happen to be

00:19:03.710 --> 00:19:05.500
about that same topic and
you've posted something

00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:07.860
similar and it's of interest
and Google thinks that it's

00:19:07.860 --> 00:19:10.270
worth popping up, you've already
done the work to help

00:19:10.270 --> 00:19:13.030
Google get that content to the
right person who's already

00:19:13.030 --> 00:19:15.310
interested and already committed
to that stuff.

00:19:15.310 --> 00:19:17.630
So by first of all tagging
your content in

00:19:17.630 --> 00:19:19.240
Google+ that helps.

00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:23.120
Secondly, by adding this kind
of markup to your web pages

00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:26.120
that allows Google to then
take that content that's

00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:28.330
flowing through Google flowing
through Google+ and all these

00:19:28.330 --> 00:19:31.630
different contexts that Google
touches and again know that

00:19:31.630 --> 00:19:35.670
what you mean is that this is
content in this case that's

00:19:35.670 --> 00:19:39.200
similar or related to or the
same as some other content.

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:42.340
So when I go, OK, Google, I'd
like to hear a remix of "Like

00:19:42.340 --> 00:19:46.230
a G6", Paul's song, my song,
our song has the chance of

00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:49.320
actually showing up
in the results.

00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:51.430
In whatever format
that may take--

00:19:51.430 --> 00:19:54.020
whether it's a related post
whether it's something in

00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:56.610
Glass or whether
it's in search.

00:19:56.610 --> 00:19:58.890
So that's why this is really
important and really critical

00:19:58.890 --> 00:20:00.850
to think about when you're
actually composing your

00:20:00.850 --> 00:20:03.650
content and marking
up your pages.

00:20:03.650 --> 00:20:05.400
PAUL LINDNER: Thank
you, Chris.

00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:08.690
So let's move on from talking
about relating content to

00:20:08.690 --> 00:20:12.270
other content to relating
from you, the

00:20:12.270 --> 00:20:15.330
publisher, to your users.

00:20:15.330 --> 00:20:16.820
Back then you might have
actually had one of

00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:18.530
these on your site.

00:20:18.530 --> 00:20:20.375
And people might have emailed
you and you might have

00:20:20.375 --> 00:20:21.040
emailed them back.

00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:25.990
But Google+ now has a much
better way of maintaining

00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:27.310
contact with your users.

00:20:27.310 --> 00:20:29.510
And that's by creating
a Plus Page.

00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:33.380
Plus Pages are available for
most different categories of

00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:38.800
entities, whether you're a small
group or a rock band.

00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:42.160
Publishers probably fall under
the brand category.

00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:44.460
But in any, case you can go and
very quickly create a Plus

00:20:44.460 --> 00:20:46.260
page for each of the different
entities that you have.

00:20:48.930 --> 00:20:53.030
Once you have a Plus page you
need to really stand out.

00:20:53.030 --> 00:20:56.010
And to really stand out you
should definitely use some of

00:20:56.010 --> 00:20:58.410
the new features that
have come with

00:20:58.410 --> 00:21:01.110
upgraded Google+ profiles.

00:21:01.110 --> 00:21:03.905
I think this is a pretty
good interesting Plus

00:21:03.905 --> 00:21:04.900
page, don't you think?

00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:05.680
CHRIS MESSINA: It's
a good start.

00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:06.280
PAUL LINDNER: It's a start.

00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:06.870
OK.

00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:10.950
So in, any case what makes
a good Plus page?

00:21:10.950 --> 00:21:13.970
Well number one is that big
beautiful cover photo.

00:21:13.970 --> 00:21:16.500
You really want to make it
pop bigger is better.

00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:18.290
Again, focus on the high res.

00:21:18.290 --> 00:21:20.470
Focus on the pixels.

00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:24.190
You want to make sure that the
bottom 12% looks good too.

00:21:24.190 --> 00:21:26.910
Because you're going to see what
it looks like like that,

00:21:26.910 --> 00:21:28.230
sort of scrolled down.

00:21:28.230 --> 00:21:30.510
Make sure you don't have any
weird overlaps between your

00:21:30.510 --> 00:21:34.340
profile photo and
the cover photo.

00:21:34.340 --> 00:21:36.270
Don't put a whole bunch of
text on your cover photo.

00:21:36.270 --> 00:21:39.350
It might come out looking
not as you expect.

00:21:39.350 --> 00:21:42.030
And again the same thing applies
to profile photos.

00:21:42.030 --> 00:21:43.020
Make them big.

00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:44.320
Make them pretty.

00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:46.410
And also just be aware that--

00:21:46.410 --> 00:21:47.330
as you can see--

00:21:47.330 --> 00:21:49.730
your profile photo is going
to be in a circle in some

00:21:49.730 --> 00:21:54.090
contexts and also as a square
in other contexts.

00:21:54.090 --> 00:21:56.230
And if you're feeling
really creative, you

00:21:56.230 --> 00:21:58.620
can also use animation.

00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:00.490
And we've had a couple of Plus
pages that have done some

00:22:00.490 --> 00:22:02.750
really crazy stuff.

00:22:02.750 --> 00:22:05.350
Just amazed.

00:22:05.350 --> 00:22:08.410
So if that's your thing there's
a whole talk that's

00:22:08.410 --> 00:22:10.470
going to talk about building
audiences using things like

00:22:10.470 --> 00:22:12.840
Plus pages by Amy Walgenbach.

00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:14.140
That's tomorrow.

00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:17.460
So definitely give that
a try if you are in

00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:19.700
that sort of category.

00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:22.200
If there's one thing they can
take away from this though is

00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:25.630
what I want you to do is
to link your Google+

00:22:25.630 --> 00:22:28.590
page to your site.

00:22:28.590 --> 00:22:31.580
And that unlocks a number of
features, and I'll go over to

00:22:31.580 --> 00:22:32.770
them in just a second.

00:22:32.770 --> 00:22:35.100
But if you haven't done
already as part of the

00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:38.460
creation process, just go to
your profile as a Plus page

00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:41.510
and add it to your
link section.

00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:45.370
So once you've done that, once
you've added the link to your

00:22:45.370 --> 00:22:48.510
site for your Plus page,
you need to verify it.

00:22:48.510 --> 00:22:54.680
And to verify you need to make
the link back to your to your

00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:55.120
Google+ profile.

00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:56.600
So it's very easy to do.

00:22:56.600 --> 00:23:01.040
Just add a section to the head
of your document that contains

00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:03.450
your Google+ page.

00:23:03.450 --> 00:23:05.330
You can use the testing tool.

00:23:05.330 --> 00:23:07.990
The testing tool lets you see
the web is Google Sees It.

00:23:07.990 --> 00:23:10.650
And that will tell you if
you've got it right.

00:23:10.650 --> 00:23:11.710
And then what happens?

00:23:11.710 --> 00:23:15.190
In a day or two, you're going
to get this little check box

00:23:15.190 --> 00:23:18.520
next to your Plus page
and your site.

00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:22.090
And that tells users that this
is the authoritative Plus page

00:23:22.090 --> 00:23:23.900
for that site.

00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:25.340
And that's really important
when people are actually

00:23:25.340 --> 00:23:27.710
looking through a list of all
the different brands and

00:23:27.710 --> 00:23:30.000
categories, they're going to
look for that checkbox.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:31.330
And it shows up in
many places.

00:23:31.330 --> 00:23:35.530
In your profile, in the
stream, in search.

00:23:35.530 --> 00:23:38.750
So there's more than one way
to add to that linkage.

00:23:38.750 --> 00:23:43.990
And I want to tell you about
something new and that is the

00:23:43.990 --> 00:23:45.520
Google+ Badge.

00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:49.540
We've had Google+ Badges
for a while but this

00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:51.390
badge is much better.

00:23:51.390 --> 00:23:51.730
CHRIS MESSINA: Yes.

00:23:51.730 --> 00:23:53.450
PAUL LINDNER: Thanks to
people like Chris.

00:23:53.450 --> 00:23:54.400
CHRIS MESSINA: Yes.

00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:57.060
PAUL LINDNER: It allows you to
do the same type of thing but

00:23:57.060 --> 00:24:01.260
also gives users a way to
follow your site and see

00:24:01.260 --> 00:24:04.770
information about your Plus
page in your site without

00:24:04.770 --> 00:24:06.630
having to go to Google+
at all.

00:24:06.630 --> 00:24:08.600
And as we support different
kinds of different kinds.

00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:09.680
Which one do you like?

00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:10.790
CHRIS MESSINA: The
one on the right.

00:24:10.790 --> 00:24:11.690
PAUL LINDNER: One on the right.

00:24:11.690 --> 00:24:12.430
OK, great.

00:24:12.430 --> 00:24:13.250
Let's do that.

00:24:13.250 --> 00:24:15.590
So here's some sample
markup of how that

00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:17.330
might actually work.

00:24:17.330 --> 00:24:20.980
Just add a small div tag, put
it into your page and the

00:24:20.980 --> 00:24:21.820
badge appears.

00:24:21.820 --> 00:24:23.140
CHRIS MESSINA: And to be clear,
these are not launched

00:24:23.140 --> 00:24:24.260
yet, is that right?

00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:25.470
PAUL LINDNER: They're available

00:24:25.470 --> 00:24:27.690
only for trusted testers.

00:24:27.690 --> 00:24:29.180
But they'll be launching soon.

00:24:29.180 --> 00:24:31.080
CHRIS MESSINA: So this
is like new stuff.

00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:31.940
PAUL LINDNER: It's new, yes.

00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:32.930
It is very new.

00:24:32.930 --> 00:24:34.590
Fresh.

00:24:34.590 --> 00:24:36.290
So maybe your site is--

00:24:36.290 --> 00:24:38.750
that's pretty big, though,
you got to agree.

00:24:38.750 --> 00:24:40.080
Maybe you want to actually have

00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:41.330
something a little smaller?

00:24:43.490 --> 00:24:45.100
So how about this.

00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:48.090
This is the Google+
Follow button.

00:24:48.090 --> 00:24:50.880
So it allows you to do the
same kinds of things.

00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:53.750
Verifying your site, allowing
users to follow you in your

00:24:53.750 --> 00:24:57.900
page, with just a very small
amount of pixels.

00:24:57.900 --> 00:24:59.260
CHRIS MESSINA: To be clear,
you can only get a Follow

00:24:59.260 --> 00:25:03.460
button today by embedding
this much larger badge.

00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:06.450
And so we've obviously heard a
bunch of feedback about having

00:25:06.450 --> 00:25:08.180
more flexible solutions.

00:25:08.180 --> 00:25:11.240
And so you we're putting this
Follow button out in

00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:11.940
preview right now.

00:25:11.940 --> 00:25:14.150
So there's a lot more
flexibility in terms of where

00:25:14.150 --> 00:25:17.140
you can put this badge and
how you can make it look.

00:25:17.140 --> 00:25:19.640
PAUL LINDNER: Awesome, thanks.

00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:21.010
You've got your follow button.

00:25:21.010 --> 00:25:22.810
You've got a badge.

00:25:22.810 --> 00:25:24.760
Follow buttons also work
for people, too.

00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:27.820
Here's our little
song as well.

00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:29.380
It works for both contexts.

00:25:29.380 --> 00:25:31.780
It's actually great to put
it on a byline like that.

00:25:31.780 --> 00:25:33.760
It just appears right in line.

00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:34.990
So people can just follow you.

00:25:34.990 --> 00:25:38.810
So speaking of authors, someone
who writes lyrics is

00:25:38.810 --> 00:25:39.860
an author, don't you think?

00:25:39.860 --> 00:25:40.290
CHRIS MESSINA: Yeah.

00:25:40.290 --> 00:25:40.420
For sure.

00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:41.150
PAUL LINDNER: Photographers?

00:25:41.150 --> 00:25:41.920
CHRIS MESSINA: Yeah.

00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:42.680
PAUL LINDNER: Videographers?

00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:43.910
CHRIS MESSINA: I mean all these
people are creative.

00:25:43.910 --> 00:25:45.940
PAUL LINDNER: They're
creative.

00:25:45.940 --> 00:25:49.200
So Google actually has something
for those authors.

00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:50.450
And that's called Google+
authorship.

00:25:52.770 --> 00:25:54.970
Here's an example of a
search result that

00:25:54.970 --> 00:25:56.460
I did it for myself--

00:25:56.460 --> 00:25:58.920
well for our little project.

00:25:58.920 --> 00:25:59.850
Look at that bottom result.

00:25:59.850 --> 00:26:01.170
What do you notice?

00:26:01.170 --> 00:26:02.080
CHRIS MESSINA: There's a face.

00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:02.880
PAUL LINDNER: There's
a face, yeah.

00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:03.870
CHRIS MESSINA: There's a name.

00:26:03.870 --> 00:26:05.950
PAUL LINDNER: Yeah.

00:26:05.950 --> 00:26:07.060
The numbers of circles.

00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:08.040
CHRIS MESSINA: There's
a number of circles.

00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:10.480
PAUL LINDNER: Yep.

00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:12.980
I think that everyone in the
room will agree that this is a

00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:16.520
much more compelling
search result.

00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:18.850
And we think every author should
have that opportunity.

00:26:18.850 --> 00:26:20.900
So how did this happen?

00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:25.620
If you go to my profile you'll
notice that I actually have a

00:26:25.620 --> 00:26:29.980
link to my GitHub profile which
is where that content

00:26:29.980 --> 00:26:30.980
was hosted.

00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:32.520
CHRIS MESSINA: Oh.

00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:34.780
PAUL LINDNER: And I also have a
link from my GitHub profile

00:26:34.780 --> 00:26:37.420
back to my Google+ profile.

00:26:37.420 --> 00:26:40.470
So Google being the very smart
search engine that it is able

00:26:40.470 --> 00:26:43.130
to understand that those two
things are related and that my

00:26:43.130 --> 00:26:46.260
GitHub content is
authored by me.

00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:47.170
But you may say well
you know what?

00:26:47.170 --> 00:26:49.330
I don't have profile pages
on my website.

00:26:49.330 --> 00:26:50.700
There's got to be something
I can do for that.

00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:52.570
Well, we've got you covered.

00:26:52.570 --> 00:26:55.210
There's another section of your
profile that is called

00:26:55.210 --> 00:26:57.060
the contributor to section.

00:26:57.060 --> 00:27:02.490
And that is what your authors
can use to list your website.

00:27:02.490 --> 00:27:05.420
And then any content on that
site that is properly marked

00:27:05.420 --> 00:27:06.800
up will be attributed to them.

00:27:09.510 --> 00:27:14.370
So there's one more step you
need to take to get authorship

00:27:14.370 --> 00:27:15.860
and that search results.

00:27:15.860 --> 00:27:19.110
You can use the rel=author
tag.

00:27:19.110 --> 00:27:22.450
And you just put this on your
site on authored content.

00:27:22.450 --> 00:27:26.795
So for example on that little
song page that we had, we

00:27:26.795 --> 00:27:28.270
would add rel=author to that.

00:27:28.270 --> 00:27:30.900
And there's three ways that I
have up here on the slide.

00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:32.630
One is you could put it in
the head of the document.

00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:34.980
It's invisible, and
you're done.

00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:38.780
Second one is you could use a
Badge or Follow button with

00:27:38.780 --> 00:27:40.520
the rel=author tag.

00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:41.390
You're done.

00:27:41.390 --> 00:27:45.350
And then the third way is if you
actually have the link to

00:27:45.350 --> 00:27:49.420
your Google+ page directly, you
can just again add a rel

00:27:49.420 --> 00:27:51.830
attribute with the
author value.

00:27:51.830 --> 00:27:54.550
And you're done.

00:27:54.550 --> 00:27:57.030
So that's one way of getting
some really cool content in

00:27:57.030 --> 00:27:57.610
the search.

00:27:57.610 --> 00:27:59.810
There might be one other way.

00:27:59.810 --> 00:28:00.900
What do you think?

00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:01.620
What else appears in
search results?

00:28:01.620 --> 00:28:02.490
CHRIS MESSINA: I don't know.

00:28:02.490 --> 00:28:04.000
Tell me.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:05.092
PAUL LINDNER: It is ads.

00:28:05.092 --> 00:28:06.390
CHRIS MESSINA: Of course.

00:28:06.390 --> 00:28:07.200
PAUL LINDNER: Of course
it's ads.

00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:07.850
CHRIS MESSINA: Of course.

00:28:07.850 --> 00:28:09.750
PAUL LINDNER: One other thing,
by verifying your Plus page

00:28:09.750 --> 00:28:12.330
you get one other benefit
that is really cool.

00:28:12.330 --> 00:28:16.840
If you saw the talk earlier
about the platform you may

00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:19.800
have seen that we talked a
little bit about you can

00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:23.780
actually get 5 to 10% better
results on your ads if you

00:28:23.780 --> 00:28:24.920
link them to your
Google+ profile.

00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:25.970
CHRIS MESSINA: That's huge.

00:28:25.970 --> 00:28:28.750
Now, do I have to pay more to
get the 5 to 10% increase?

00:28:28.750 --> 00:28:29.390
PAUL LINDNER: No.

00:28:29.390 --> 00:28:29.860
You just have to--

00:28:29.860 --> 00:28:31.580
CHRIS MESSINA: So you're saying
if I create great

00:28:31.580 --> 00:28:35.180
content and I get people to
follow me and +1 my stuff I'm

00:28:35.180 --> 00:28:39.790
going to get 5 to 10% possibly
better results than someone

00:28:39.790 --> 00:28:40.450
who doesn't do those things?

00:28:40.450 --> 00:28:41.070
PAUL LINDNER: Right.

00:28:41.070 --> 00:28:42.460
And you'll also get
this benefit.

00:28:42.460 --> 00:28:45.150
Your ads will show up with
your number of followers.

00:28:45.150 --> 00:28:49.170
And they'll also include a
link to your profile and

00:28:49.170 --> 00:28:52.020
clicks on that link, you
don't have to pay for.

00:28:52.020 --> 00:28:54.720
and with Google's new enhanced
campaigns, it's really just a

00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:57.840
matter of adding your Plus page
to your ad campaign and

00:28:57.840 --> 00:28:59.920
you're done.

00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:01.880
And if you really like the
search stuff, I definitely

00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:04.520
recommend you check out John
and Ardan's talk-- which is

00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:06.900
actually following this-- which
is all about other great

00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:10.980
ways of getting into
search results.

00:29:10.980 --> 00:29:12.940
So Chris is going to tell us
a little bit about mobile

00:29:12.940 --> 00:29:13.770
recommendations.

00:29:13.770 --> 00:29:16.220
Which is a new thing that we
just launched on Monday that

00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:17.540
is really cool.

00:29:17.540 --> 00:29:21.130
CHRIS MESSINA: So the thing
that's important about mobile

00:29:21.130 --> 00:29:23.420
recommendations-- and what I'm
going to show you next--

00:29:23.420 --> 00:29:25.410
is that this is actually
bringing together all the

00:29:25.410 --> 00:29:28.120
techniques that Paul
just described.

00:29:28.120 --> 00:29:32.590
So from the rel authorship to
the canonicalization to adding

00:29:32.590 --> 00:29:38.060
the badges to adding following
links and +1's, what we want

00:29:38.060 --> 00:29:40.370
to do is make it possible for
people who are coming to your

00:29:40.370 --> 00:29:44.470
site, who are on mobile, to be
able to find content that

00:29:44.470 --> 00:29:47.820
you've produced when they're
most interested and most

00:29:47.820 --> 00:29:52.490
compelled to actually find the
next link of what to read.

00:29:52.490 --> 00:29:58.930
So the way that this works is
that you go into the Plus page

00:29:58.930 --> 00:30:01.590
console, control panel
essentially--

00:30:01.590 --> 00:30:05.100
log in as the page owner--

00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:08.100
and from here you click
For Your Site.

00:30:08.100 --> 00:30:10.440
Basically, these are the
controls that enable you to

00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:13.570
take the Google+ experience and
start adding more features

00:30:13.570 --> 00:30:16.720
to your site without doing any
extra work besides adding that

00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:21.010
layer of JavaScript that
Paul first described.

00:30:21.010 --> 00:30:22.570
The first thing that you'll have
to do is of course the

00:30:22.570 --> 00:30:23.650
one time set up.

00:30:23.650 --> 00:30:26.690
This of course happens one
time as it suggests.

00:30:26.690 --> 00:30:30.600
And if you've already got plus
+1 JS on your site you're

00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:31.900
almost all set.

00:30:31.900 --> 00:30:33.410
But there's one very,
very important thing

00:30:33.410 --> 00:30:36.040
that you need to do.

00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:39.500
You need to add your publisher
ID so your Plus page ID gets

00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:43.710
added as a unique
ID to this call.

00:30:43.710 --> 00:30:45.750
The reason why this is really
important is because you want

00:30:45.750 --> 00:30:50.520
to get recommendations of your
content when users are seeing

00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:51.830
these recommendations.

00:30:51.830 --> 00:30:57.590
This is what tells Google what
source of data to use when

00:30:57.590 --> 00:30:59.900
presenting those recommendations
to people.

00:30:59.900 --> 00:31:00.970
So essentially it's like, hey.

00:31:00.970 --> 00:31:02.820
Here's that unique ID
that represents us

00:31:02.820 --> 00:31:04.730
in the Google ecosystem.

00:31:04.730 --> 00:31:06.990
Start showing those content
recommendations to people who

00:31:06.990 --> 00:31:09.000
are visiting and browsing
my site on mobile.

00:31:11.530 --> 00:31:12.160
OK.

00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:14.120
So once you come back here
you've completed that one time

00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:16.150
set up, all you have to
do is turn this on.

00:31:16.150 --> 00:31:17.820
There are a couple more details
in here for more

00:31:17.820 --> 00:31:19.580
control that you can
look at, which I'm

00:31:19.580 --> 00:31:21.320
not going to go into.

00:31:21.320 --> 00:31:24.450
But users are essentially able
to get information from the

00:31:24.450 --> 00:31:26.110
same author.

00:31:26.110 --> 00:31:27.720
So if this is a really
compelling article and you

00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:30.160
really like the author and what
they've had to say, Boom.

00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:30.910
Recommendations.

00:31:30.910 --> 00:31:32.100
More from that author.

00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:33.760
You're able to get stuff
related to topics.

00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:35.870
Remember like that hashtag stuff
that I talked about?

00:31:35.870 --> 00:31:38.240
This stuff happens
in mystical ways.

00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:40.300
We will bring this content to
the right people if you tell

00:31:40.300 --> 00:31:43.700
us what it's about and you let
us know precisely what people

00:31:43.700 --> 00:31:45.160
are probably looking for
when they want to

00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:48.160
come see your content.

00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:49.730
And of course +1 content.

00:31:49.730 --> 00:31:51.490
So for people that are visiting
your site and have

00:31:51.490 --> 00:31:54.010
friends that have +1'd that
content, we're able to deliver

00:31:54.010 --> 00:31:57.460
those recommendations through
the lens of your friends.

00:31:57.460 --> 00:31:59.510
So other people like you, people
that you know, people

00:31:59.510 --> 00:32:01.860
that are in your circles who
have +1'd content on that site

00:32:01.860 --> 00:32:04.020
are now delivering content
to you through this

00:32:04.020 --> 00:32:07.370
recommendation [INAUDIBLE]
as well.

00:32:07.370 --> 00:32:09.290
Again, these are all different
ways for getting

00:32:09.290 --> 00:32:10.700
content into Google.

00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:13.000
Making it more contextual.

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:15.030
Adding the power of Google
and the Google content

00:32:15.030 --> 00:32:16.640
network to your site.

00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:19.030
And of course, don't forget
to add your hash tags to

00:32:19.030 --> 00:32:20.290
everything you do.

00:32:20.290 --> 00:32:22.590
Your Cheerios and
your vegetables.

00:32:22.590 --> 00:32:23.840
It's really important.

00:32:26.010 --> 00:32:29.060
Lastly after I/O, obviously
there's a bunch more content

00:32:29.060 --> 00:32:32.210
coming up, but we do recommend
you follow us on Google+

00:32:32.210 --> 00:32:34.670
because we're also in this
ecosystem and want to make

00:32:34.670 --> 00:32:36.660
sure that our content gets to
you at the right in the right

00:32:36.660 --> 00:32:39.280
moment when you're
most interested.

00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:42.200
We have a Plus page, Plus

00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:44.740
Google Plus Developers
on Google.

00:32:44.740 --> 00:32:47.190
We have office hours coming
up and you can

00:32:47.190 --> 00:32:50.550
contact us via our profiles.

00:32:50.550 --> 00:32:51.940
PAUL LINDNER: Thank you.

00:32:51.940 --> 00:32:54.910
So, we have a little time
for Q&amp;A. Thanks.

00:32:54.910 --> 00:32:56.220
CHRIS MESSINA: And if you do
have questions please come up

00:32:56.220 --> 00:32:57.470
to the mics.

00:32:57.470 --> 00:32:59.300
I think this is either
being recorded or

00:32:59.300 --> 00:33:01.060
live broadcast or--

00:33:01.060 --> 00:33:01.400
PAUL LINDNER: It's recorded.

00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:04.550
CHRIS MESSINA: --Martians
are listening somehow.

00:33:04.550 --> 00:33:07.260
PAUL LINDNER: And also after
this talk we'll be over at the

00:33:07.260 --> 00:33:09.210
Google+ office hours to answer
any further questions you

00:33:09.210 --> 00:33:10.330
might have.

00:33:10.330 --> 00:33:11.700
Yes, you on the left.

00:33:11.700 --> 00:33:12.240
AUDIENCE: Hi, [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:13.550
from Missoula.

00:33:13.550 --> 00:33:16.970
First I want to applaud you guys
for doing a good job with

00:33:16.970 --> 00:33:20.430
the rel values and connecting
profiles to sites with the

00:33:20.430 --> 00:33:23.660
publisher and author and
me and all that.

00:33:23.660 --> 00:33:26.870
It's really good to see Google+
spearhead that and

00:33:26.870 --> 00:33:30.040
make that happen for the
broader web community.

00:33:30.040 --> 00:33:34.200
My question is the div markup
you showed for the Badge or

00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:38.000
the Follow button, that doesn't
work if there's no

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:38.970
JavaScript.

00:33:38.970 --> 00:33:40.640
Which happens a lot.

00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:43.540
Like if the Wi-Fi is failing
for example and JavaScript

00:33:43.540 --> 00:33:44.420
doesn't load.

00:33:44.420 --> 00:33:49.400
So my question is, do you guys
have plans to give a a href,

00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:54.750
like a hyperlink version, that
will at least my take visitors

00:33:54.750 --> 00:33:57.650
to my site, to my Plus profile
even if there's zero

00:33:57.650 --> 00:33:59.620
JavaScript loaded or
anything like that?

00:33:59.620 --> 00:34:02.730
Because Twitter does that with
their follow button.

00:34:02.730 --> 00:34:05.410
And otherwise I'll just
have this empty dead

00:34:05.410 --> 00:34:07.130
div with a G+ button.

00:34:07.130 --> 00:34:08.080
CHRIS MESSINA: Can
I speak to that?

00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:09.690
AUDIENCE: Hoping to see
an upgrade there.

00:34:09.690 --> 00:34:10.030
PAUL LINDNER: Yeah.

00:34:10.030 --> 00:34:11.429
I'll just say one thing
and then I'll let

00:34:11.429 --> 00:34:12.630
Chris take it over.

00:34:12.630 --> 00:34:13.830
Yeah, that's a popular
request.

00:34:13.830 --> 00:34:17.159
There's actually an issue
on our tracker.

00:34:17.159 --> 00:34:19.270
And we take your feedback
very seriously.

00:34:19.270 --> 00:34:19.840
CHRIS MESSINA: Yeah.

00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:20.989
I would say two things.

00:34:20.989 --> 00:34:23.830
First, you actually can get a
Badge which is just a standard

00:34:23.830 --> 00:34:29.219
a href image, old school web,
totally works, no JavaScript,

00:34:29.219 --> 00:34:31.280
images turned off all
that good stuff.

00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:33.199
So that solution does exist.

00:34:33.199 --> 00:34:34.980
In the particular case here
where you're embedding this

00:34:34.980 --> 00:34:38.440
button, we're absolutely looking
into and thinking

00:34:38.440 --> 00:34:41.670
about how we could better
address cases

00:34:41.670 --> 00:34:43.449
like email, for example.

00:34:43.449 --> 00:34:46.199
But we have nothing to
announce right now.

00:34:46.199 --> 00:34:49.230
That's what I've learned to say
in the last three years.

00:34:49.230 --> 00:34:50.570
AUDIENCE: I don't want
a separate badge.

00:34:50.570 --> 00:34:54.710
I want an a href badge that
get smarter the JavaScript

00:34:54.710 --> 00:34:55.350
once it loads.

00:34:55.350 --> 00:34:55.669
CHRIS MESSINA: Absolutely.

00:34:55.669 --> 00:34:56.324
PAUL LINDNER: Yep.

00:34:56.324 --> 00:34:57.530
AUDIENCE: OK, thanks.

00:34:57.530 --> 00:34:58.030
CHRIS MESSINA: Thank you.

00:34:58.030 --> 00:35:00.868
PAUL LINDNER: Thank you.

00:35:00.868 --> 00:35:03.350
AUDIENCE: Hey guys, a
quick question for

00:35:03.350 --> 00:35:05.600
authorship for SEO value.

00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:08.660
Right now I'm seeing that it
runs out and you can implement

00:35:08.660 --> 00:35:11.320
and it can show up in a week,
it can show up in

00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:13.320
a month, two months.

00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:15.980
When's it going to roll
out at a faster rate?

00:35:15.980 --> 00:35:17.920
And then the other part of that
question, when's it going

00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:19.200
to roll out globally?

00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:22.140
There's a lot of SEO value in
that for a lot of millions and

00:35:22.140 --> 00:35:23.500
billions of dollars.

00:35:23.500 --> 00:35:24.400
PAUL LINDNER: Yes,
I understand.

00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:27.732
Authorship is becoming actually
quite popular--

00:35:27.732 --> 00:35:28.750
CHRIS MESSINA: For
good reason.

00:35:28.750 --> 00:35:31.090
PAUL LINDNER: --for search
engine optimization.

00:35:31.090 --> 00:35:35.140
Because if you can make the
content more relevant to the

00:35:35.140 --> 00:35:37.650
people, then it's much
more valuable.

00:35:37.650 --> 00:35:39.440
To each of your questions--

00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:42.560
So when's it going to
roll out globally?

00:35:42.560 --> 00:35:45.400
I don't know yet.

00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:48.030
The authorship team continues
to make great strides in

00:35:48.030 --> 00:35:50.520
making it more and
more useful.

00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:53.620
And then the first
question was--

00:35:53.620 --> 00:35:55.080
you remember?

00:35:55.080 --> 00:35:56.730
CHRIS MESSINA: Globally
versus speed.

00:35:56.730 --> 00:35:57.390
PAUL LINDNER: Globally
versus speed.

00:35:57.390 --> 00:35:58.050
Oh yeah, the speed.

00:35:58.050 --> 00:36:01.150
So they've done a couple
of things recently.

00:36:01.150 --> 00:36:04.470
One is that if you've registered
for authorship by

00:36:04.470 --> 00:36:07.300
using your email address, you'll
actually get an email

00:36:07.300 --> 00:36:09.410
when it's been turned on.

00:36:09.410 --> 00:36:11.890
There's an alternate form of
authorship that relies on your

00:36:11.890 --> 00:36:13.500
email address as well.

00:36:13.500 --> 00:36:16.500
So if you go to
plus.google.com/authorship and

00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:20.690
sign up with that, that will at
least alert you to the fact

00:36:20.690 --> 00:36:22.360
when it's going to happen.

00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:26.120
And I'll take your concerns back
to the authorship team

00:36:26.120 --> 00:36:29.370
and let them know that
you're impatient.

00:36:29.370 --> 00:36:31.550
I know we're all impatient with
these kinds of things

00:36:31.550 --> 00:36:32.800
because they're really cool.

00:36:37.210 --> 00:36:40.336
AUDIENCE: So this is semi
related at best, I suppose.

00:36:40.336 --> 00:36:43.440
I've been a great follower a
proponent of the whole Google+

00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:45.940
vanity URL thing.

00:36:45.940 --> 00:36:48.600
And every time I speak to
anybody, and I do speak to a

00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:51.640
lot of Googlers, it's
like we don't know.

00:36:51.640 --> 00:36:52.870
They're trying to automate it.

00:36:52.870 --> 00:36:56.560
So I'm just kind of wondering
what's the overall scope and

00:36:56.560 --> 00:37:02.150
sort of scheduling for giving
the vanity URLs a little bit

00:37:02.150 --> 00:37:03.990
more efficiently and
effectively.

00:37:03.990 --> 00:37:04.790
PAUL LINDNER: OK.

00:37:04.790 --> 00:37:07.720
So the vanity URL process.

00:37:07.720 --> 00:37:09.980
Google+ does support
vanity URLS.

00:37:09.980 --> 00:37:11.580
but they're not like
other vanity URLs

00:37:11.580 --> 00:37:13.690
you've probably seen.

00:37:13.690 --> 00:37:17.920
Basically vanity URLs are given
to profiles that have

00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:22.580
significant traffic
and followers.

00:37:22.580 --> 00:37:25.660
So it's a process that
is not quite the

00:37:25.660 --> 00:37:26.650
same as you're expecting.

00:37:26.650 --> 00:37:29.460
So you can't just say please
give me a vanity URL.

00:37:29.460 --> 00:37:31.990
It's an automated algorithmic
process like a lot of the

00:37:31.990 --> 00:37:33.950
mysteries of Google.

00:37:33.950 --> 00:37:37.790
But the main thing you can keep
doing is engage with your

00:37:37.790 --> 00:37:41.950
audience and build your
following and the vanity URL

00:37:41.950 --> 00:37:44.770
option is then maybe possible.

00:37:44.770 --> 00:37:48.930
There's also a web form to fill
out that you can use to

00:37:48.930 --> 00:37:49.590
request it.

00:37:49.590 --> 00:37:52.450
So again nothing new on
that front right now.

00:37:52.450 --> 00:37:52.910
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:37:52.910 --> 00:37:54.880
Thank you.

00:37:54.880 --> 00:38:00.260
AUDIENCE: On the sameAs for the
schema, It seemed like it

00:38:00.260 --> 00:38:02.443
would be really helpful, but
on the other hand it seemed

00:38:02.443 --> 00:38:04.360
like a spammer's delight.

00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:09.000
So I would just tag everything
under the sun and just try to

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:09.850
show up everywhere.

00:38:09.850 --> 00:38:13.240
How are you going to prevent
that from being abused?

00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:14.980
PAUL LINDNER: So
really sameAs--

00:38:14.980 --> 00:38:18.910
so the question is what is to
stop people from spamming it

00:38:18.910 --> 00:38:21.060
and just totally blowing
up the hashtags?

00:38:21.060 --> 00:38:25.040
Well the one thing is
it's a suggestion.

00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:30.340
And as anyone knows with people
using links in Google--

00:38:30.340 --> 00:38:30.790
CHRIS MESSINA: Metatags.

00:38:30.790 --> 00:38:33.870
PAUL LINDNER: Yeah, metatags
or any number of things.

00:38:33.870 --> 00:38:38.660
So Google is quite good at
figuring out if the content on

00:38:38.660 --> 00:38:42.190
the site is actually somewhat
related or if it's something

00:38:42.190 --> 00:38:43.680
wildly divergent.

00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:47.230
So we're going to continue to
use our techniques in this

00:38:47.230 --> 00:38:50.790
space just like to use it
with regular links.

00:38:50.790 --> 00:38:56.150
The main thing is that if you do
it well you'll see results.

00:38:56.150 --> 00:38:58.950
And then hopefully our
algorithms will do a good job.

00:38:58.950 --> 00:39:00.220
And I think they will.

00:39:00.220 --> 00:39:02.910
AUDIENCE: On one other
separate question.

00:39:02.910 --> 00:39:03.880
The--

00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:05.500
I don't know what you call them,
data cards or whatever,

00:39:05.500 --> 00:39:06.690
in the search and you
end up with--

00:39:06.690 --> 00:39:07.450
CHRIS MESSINA: Knowledge
cards.

00:39:07.450 --> 00:39:08.700
AUDIENCE: Knowledge cards
on the right.

00:39:11.130 --> 00:39:15.390
Trey here is quite popular
on Google+, but we don't

00:39:15.390 --> 00:39:16.850
get that data card.

00:39:16.850 --> 00:39:19.650
Everything's circled around his
individual profile page.

00:39:19.650 --> 00:39:21.080
We don't have a business page.

00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:24.150
Is a business page required to
get the data card or the

00:39:24.150 --> 00:39:25.860
profile card?

00:39:25.860 --> 00:39:27.280
CHRIS MESSINA: I think there's a
couple different answers and

00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:29.550
you can probably add
more context.

00:39:29.550 --> 00:39:35.110
It again falls back to the
Google magical approach where

00:39:35.110 --> 00:39:37.570
it's based on a lot of
different things.

00:39:37.570 --> 00:39:40.150
Oftentimes it's based on actual
queries what people are

00:39:40.150 --> 00:39:42.580
searching for in terms of
what shows up there.

00:39:42.580 --> 00:39:46.520
And for individuals we will
source data from the profile.

00:39:46.520 --> 00:39:49.940
In other cases there's stuff in
the Knowledge Graph and so

00:39:49.940 --> 00:39:51.070
that's where that comes from.

00:39:51.070 --> 00:39:55.935
so it's a little bit of magical
mystery meat that is

00:39:55.935 --> 00:39:56.693
what is produced there.

00:39:56.693 --> 00:39:58.560
Even though it tastes
delicious.

00:39:58.560 --> 00:40:00.770
AUDIENCE: So it's not
specifically like a business

00:40:00.770 --> 00:40:02.390
profile gets it and a
person [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:02.390 --> 00:40:02.750
CHRIS MESSINA: No.

00:40:02.750 --> 00:40:03.655
AUDIENCE: But maybe we could
come afterwards?

00:40:03.655 --> 00:40:05.380
Because we'd like a few tips.

00:40:05.380 --> 00:40:08.840
Because it would seem to me
like his might work nearly

00:40:08.840 --> 00:40:10.730
100% of the time.

00:40:10.730 --> 00:40:11.550
CHRIS MESSINA: We
can talk after.

00:40:11.550 --> 00:40:12.310
AUDIENCE: Yeah, for sure.

00:40:12.310 --> 00:40:14.690
PAUL LINDNER: There's a lot
of complexities involved.

00:40:14.690 --> 00:40:17.375
But definitely profiles are
supported as knowledge panels.

00:40:17.375 --> 00:40:17.780
Certainly.

00:40:17.780 --> 00:40:18.940
Just search for Britney
Spears.

00:40:18.940 --> 00:40:20.040
CHRIS MESSINA: Alright, looks
like we're out of time.

00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:22.100
You want to get yours
in quickly, Danny?

00:40:22.100 --> 00:40:22.495
DANNY: [LAUGHS]

00:40:22.495 --> 00:40:23.738
I've got like five.

00:40:23.738 --> 00:40:24.586
CHRIS MESSINA: [LAUGHS]

00:40:24.586 --> 00:40:27.640
DANNY: If I redirect you're
going to count all this shares

00:40:27.640 --> 00:40:30.180
in the previous URL
to the new one?

00:40:30.180 --> 00:40:32.030
PAUL LINDNER: OK, so this is
about the canonicalization.

00:40:32.030 --> 00:40:32.140
DANNY: Kind of.

00:40:32.140 --> 00:40:33.750
Kind of.

00:40:33.750 --> 00:40:35.550
PAUL LINDNER: So we told
you use rel=canonical.

00:40:35.550 --> 00:40:38.370
And that is the best way.

00:40:38.370 --> 00:40:40.130
We have other ways.

00:40:40.130 --> 00:40:42.780
They may not be as
explicit or easy.

00:40:42.780 --> 00:40:45.820
But we generally do detect
redirects as well.

00:40:45.820 --> 00:40:50.060
And we may be able to make sure
that your old content

00:40:50.060 --> 00:40:51.040
gets there.

00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:54.210
It may not happen overnight,
because it's a gradual process

00:40:54.210 --> 00:40:56.240
as we re crawl the web, we look

00:40:56.240 --> 00:40:57.200
for things like redirects.

00:40:57.200 --> 00:41:00.760
We look for things like meta
refreshes and other markup

00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:03.950
that tells you that this page
is that other page.

00:41:03.950 --> 00:41:05.290
So there's a number of
techniques used.

00:41:05.290 --> 00:41:09.450
But over time you should see
that if you do rename your

00:41:09.450 --> 00:41:11.350
site for example.

00:41:11.350 --> 00:41:13.310
DANNY: Say you have a page, it's
an old page and it's got

00:41:13.310 --> 00:41:14.740
500 +1's on it.

00:41:14.740 --> 00:41:16.260
And for some reason
you need to rename

00:41:16.260 --> 00:41:17.620
the URL of that page.

00:41:17.620 --> 00:41:20.430
Typically you would redirect to
where it was going to go.

00:41:20.430 --> 00:41:23.130
It sounds like you're
saying that the--

00:41:23.130 --> 00:41:24.430
I mean, I don't see how the
canonical's going to

00:41:24.430 --> 00:41:25.170
help you with that.

00:41:25.170 --> 00:41:25.880
PAUL LINDNER: OK.

00:41:25.880 --> 00:41:29.160
If you have two different pages
that you serve up on two

00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:31.370
different URLs and they're
really the same thing, use

00:41:31.370 --> 00:41:32.320
rel=canonical.

00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:32.990
DANNY: Right.

00:41:32.990 --> 00:41:34.450
PAUL LINDNER: There's a whole
bunch of articles in Webmaster

00:41:34.450 --> 00:41:36.650
Tools and I'm also happy
to talk to you

00:41:36.650 --> 00:41:37.490
later on about this.

00:41:37.490 --> 00:41:39.960
But the other thing I'll just
stress is that if you're

00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:42.722
moving websites, at least
redirect the old site to the

00:41:42.722 --> 00:41:44.300
new site and that at
least gives us some

00:41:44.300 --> 00:41:46.680
information to go on.

00:41:46.680 --> 00:41:47.640
OK thanks everyone.

00:41:47.640 --> 00:41:48.440
CHRIS MESSINA: Thank you.

00:41:48.440 --> 00:41:52.630
