GDP is comprised of growth in the

GDP is comprised of growth in the
 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.730
GDP is comprised of growth in the
workforce and then growth in

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740
workforce and then growth in
 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.120
workforce and then growth in
productivity so if you have slowing

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130
productivity so if you have slowing
 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.260
productivity so if you have slowing
workforce growth that tells you that

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270
workforce growth that tells you that
 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.120
workforce growth that tells you that
that's going to create a real headwind

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130
that's going to create a real headwind
 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.849
that's going to create a real headwind
for GDP growth and it means that if

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859
for GDP growth and it means that if
 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.670
for GDP growth and it means that if
you're gonna have more than sluggish GDP

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680
you're gonna have more than sluggish GDP
 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.140
you're gonna have more than sluggish GDP
growth you're gonna need more growth

number of reasons for that but one of

00:01:23.389 --> 00:01:23.399
number of reasons for that but one of
 

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:25.039
number of reasons for that but one of
them is I think the markets are

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049
them is I think the markets are
 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.459

expecting relatively sluggish GDP growth
in the years ahead and one of the

00:01:29.959 --> 00:01:29.969
in the years ahead and one of the
 

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:32.480
in the years ahead and one of the
primary reasons for that is slowing

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490
primary reasons for that is slowing
 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.999
primary reasons for that is slowing

greater extent even than the United
 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.010
greater extent even than the United
States and as a result of that their

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020
States and as a result of that their
 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.160
