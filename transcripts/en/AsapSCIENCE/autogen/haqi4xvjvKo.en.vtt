00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.970
 Cigarettes and marijuana have been used for centuries, but the process of steaming 

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:09.849
 Materials have become common only recently. So, what science says about these 

00:00:09.849 --> 00:00:13.049
 Technology? Is it better for your health really? 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.369
 When smoking normally, the heat of the torch will cause the material to be converted from solid state 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.340
 To the gaseous state (vapor). This causes nicotine to be released from the cigarette and then absorbed through the lungs 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.689
 Blood, causing an increase in heart rate, narrowing of the blood vessels, and the release of dopamine in the blood 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:31.919
 Brain and sense of alertness. But the fact that nicotine is a stimulant is not available 

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:37.200
 Causing "nostalgia", which eventually leads to addiction to many. in a 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.980
 In the case of marijuana, THC's effective content turns into vapor and follows the same pathway 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.160
 Until it reaches the blood, but it causes different effects explained in the video "your brain 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.000
 Under the influence of marijuana "here. 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.230
 Smoking takes only 6 seconds until effective contents reach your nervous system, unlike 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.780
 Chewing tobacco or eating marijuana in a meal that takes much longer, but you 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.940
 Smoke inhalation in the process. This smoke contains partially the particles 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:07.600
 Tar in your body, has a cancerous effect, causes blackness in the teeth and breaks taste buds. Here 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.119
 The role of "fumigation". 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.460
 If the active content is heated enough to convert it into vapor without having to burn it 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.859
 You can theoretically get a quick effect without leading to 

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:22.979
 Damage caused by smoke inhalation. A fumigant usually contains a glass or metal chamber that passes through it 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.229
 Electronic current - This way it can be heated to a certain temperature 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:31.780
 With less burning possible, which means you breathe in much less smoke. 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.200
 For marijuana users, fumigants have become common since plant material can be heated to 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:42.869
 A certain temperature - usually between 185 and 210 degrees Celsius - is erased 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.780
 For steam containing THC. In electronic cigarettes, liquid solutions are used instead 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.979
 Of tobacco is usually dried; this solution contains water, nicotine, alkaline 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.969
 And evaporates at much lower temperatures. But here 

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:59.240
 Things get a bit complicated. 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.179
 The solution contains a substance similar to that used in cosmetics and food and is used 

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:08.220
 To maintain moisture without causing the contents to wear. One of the most commonly used substances is propylene glycol, which is 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.000
 Used in theatrical smoke, known to cause irritation in the eyes and infections 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.500
 Pneumonia. So what can happen after using electronic cigarettes for a long time? Still 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.470
 Scientists are studying these effects. Although the US Food and Drug Administration has agreed to 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.540
 These cigarettes, there is still much to know. 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.970
 The solution varies greatly between manufacturers without any controls for almost additives. 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.070
 Some were found to contain diacetyl, a chemical used in butter to give 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:39.600
 Taste "butter". Inhalation of this substance may cause a tear in the lungs known 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.990
 With "popcorn lung", the name that was called after hundreds of workers in the popcorn factory when inhaled 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:49.260
 Of this substance and their irreversible lung damage. This is an example of what can be 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.790
 Lack of quality control in electronic cigarettes can be a cause for great concern. 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.950
 But current evidence suggests that fumigants supply the body with nicotine with side effects 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:03.360
 Much less due to reduced carcinogens and inhalation of smoke. But being less dangerous 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:08.350
 Does not mean it is safe. Electronically flavored cigarettes (such as berries or grapes) are found to contain 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:13.640
 On other harmful chemicals. Passive smoking is still a problem; 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:18.700
 Of fumigants known as "nanoparticles" have an effect on lung health. as such 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.170
 There are fears that these electronic cigarettes are considered less harmful to the point that they have become 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:27.010
 More attractive to the young class. A study reported that the continuous use of electronic cigarettes for adolescents 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:32.340
 In the sixth to twelfth grades increased from 6% to 20% within 3 years. 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.870
 In contrast, many of the negative effects of normal smoking 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:41.250
 Comes from long-term studies, for example, cancers are very late. As vaporizers 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:46.460
 Relatively recent, we simply do not have the capacity to conduct long-term studies. So 

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:48.810
 We have to wait for what the future holds for us.
