00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:03.870
The amount of rain that falls
in various cities in France

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:04.740
varies.

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.340
The line plot below shows
the average monthly rainfall

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.360
in 13 different cities.

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:13.830
Measurements are rounded to the
nearest 1/4 of a centimeter.

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.900
How much more rain
falls in the rainiest

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.210
city than the second
rainiest city?

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.310
So let's make sure we
understand what they're

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.800
calling a line plot
right over here.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.690
Each of these dots
represents one

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:29.520
of the cities whose average
monthly rainfall was measured.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.620
And so, for example,
putting this dot here

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:33.950
shows that this is
the only city that

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:38.940
had 6 centimeters of
average monthly rainfall.

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.210
Here, this shows that
there were two cities that

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.840
had an average monthly
rainfall of-- looks

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.090
like 8 and 3/4 centimeters.

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.500
There are two cities that had
an average monthly rainfall

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.150
of 12 and 3/4 centimeters.

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:58.639
So at any given
amount of rainfall,

00:00:58.639 --> 00:01:00.180
it's essentially
showing you how many

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:06.430
cities had that amount of
rainfall on average per month.

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:08.850
Now that we understand
this diagram,

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.440
let's answer the question.

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.834
How much more rain falls
in the rainiest city?

00:01:13.834 --> 00:01:15.500
So the rainiest city
here, well, there's

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:21.840
only one city that's up here
at 13 and 1/2 centimeters

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.000
of rainfall.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.970
So this right over here,
let me mark this off.

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.616
This is 13 and 1/2 centimeters.

00:01:28.616 --> 00:01:30.490
How much more rain falls
in the rainiest city

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.600
than in the second
rainiest city?

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.560
Well, this is the
second rainiest city,

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.530
is this city right over here.

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.560
This is 13 and 1/4 centimeter.

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.830
So the difference between the
two is just one notch here.

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:50.522
It's just one notch, going
from 13 and 1/4 to 13 and 1/2,

00:01:50.522 --> 00:01:51.730
so one notch right over here.

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:53.730
We see that there's four
notches per centimeter.

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:56.890
One notch over here is
1/4 of a centimeter.

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:58.620
So just looking at
it, you could say

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:06.790
that the difference is
1/4 of a centimeter.

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.140
Now, if it wasn't so
clear, because here we're

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:10.870
just looking one
notch right over here,

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:12.810
you could take the
larger of the two

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.940
and subtract from that
the smaller of the two.

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:20.340
So you could take 13
and 1/2, and from that,

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.320
subtract 13 and 1/4.

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.240
And there's multiple
ways of doing this.

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.520
You could subtract
the 13 from the 13,

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.000
and then subtract
the 1/4 from the 1/2,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.147
and then you would get 1/4.

00:02:32.147 --> 00:02:33.730
Another way is you
could convert these

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.180
both into improper fractions.

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.820
So 13 and 1/2 is the
same thing as 2 times 13

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:42.860
is 26 plus 1 is 27.

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:44.980
So that's 27/2.

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:51.150
And then we could say minus--
let's see, 4 times 13 is 52,

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:57.410
plus 1 is 53, so minus 53/4.

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.480
And then in order to
do the subtraction,

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.590
you have to have the
same denominator.

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.720
And so 4 is a multiple
of 2, so we just

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.780
have to multiply the numerator
and denominator here by 2.

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:18.330
So we have 54/4 minus 53/4,
which is equal to-- well,

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:22.920
54 minus 53 is 1, over
4-- 1/4 of a centimeter.

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.272
For this problem, this would
clearly be a little bit

00:03:25.272 --> 00:03:26.730
too much that you
would have to do.

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:28.920
But this is useful
to know just in case

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.730
it wasn't as obvious
that these weren't

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.050
just next to each other.
