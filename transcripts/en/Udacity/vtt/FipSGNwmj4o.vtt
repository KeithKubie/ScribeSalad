00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.458
Well, we should multiply the first fraction by s squared divided by s

00:00:04.458 --> 00:00:09.487
squared.This would give us s squared over 2ks squared. I know I multiply this

00:00:09.487 --> 00:00:14.546
first fraction by s squared divided by s squared. S squared is missing from the

00:00:14.546 --> 00:00:19.586
2k. If we multiply s squared by 2k, we'll get 2ks squared, which would be the

00:00:19.586 --> 00:00:24.597
new denominator or our lowest common denominator. For the second fraction, we

00:00:24.597 --> 00:00:29.105
only need to multiply by k over k. 2s squared times k would give us our lowest

00:00:29.105 --> 00:00:33.149
common denominator. 2k s squared. Keep in mind that we're really just

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.752
multiplying by a form of 1 in both of these cases. We're not changing the value

00:00:37.752 --> 00:00:40.644
of the fractions, we're just changing what they look like.
