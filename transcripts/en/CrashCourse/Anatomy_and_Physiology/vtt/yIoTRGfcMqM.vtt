00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.940
We all have our reasons for eating nachos
at 3 in the afternoon.

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:06.420
I happen to have my own. And don’t ask -- it’s
personal.

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:12.560
But more generally, we all eat any kind of food to
accomplish two simple things: to obtain the energy

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:17.540
we need to stay alive and to get the raw materials
required for building all of our tissues and stuff.

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:22.800
That’s because, when it comes down to it, both you
and the food you eat contain those two same things:

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.240
Both you and food are made of “stuff”
-- by which I mean, matter, made of certain

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.290
kinds of atoms -- and both you and food have
energy stored in the bonds between those atoms.

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:38.200
So all living things need to take in stuff and energy,
and convert it into slightly different stuff and energy.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.780
And you can get some of the things you need
pretty easily. Like, in order to get oxygen

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:47.510
for respiration, to unleash the chemical energy
in your food, you just have to inhale.

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:53.910
But you can’t just breathe in the stuff you need
to build DNA, or actin, or a phospholipid bilayer.

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.830
So, how does your body really acquire “stuff”?

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:58.360
That’s where the nachos come in.

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:03.800
This cheesy, crunchy dish is made of all different
kinds of biological matter -- like carbohydrates

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.500
and fat and protein -- and it contains a certain,
probably shocking, amount of calories, which

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.280
is how we measure energy stored in the chemical
bonds in food.

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.410
So if I take, like, a 100-calorie bite of
nachos -- which probably with this much cheese

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:19.860
wouldn’t even be a very big bite -- I can
convert the chemical energy stored in those

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:25.050
carbohydrates and proteins and fats to feed
my muscle and heart cells and maybe, like,

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:28.060
walk a mile -- an activity that happens to
use about 100 calories.

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:33.860
But I can’t just swallow the nachos and watch the
lump of them travel straight to my heart or leg muscles.

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:38.620
In order to actually use this food, I have
to convert the biological matter into something

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:43.460
my body can work with on the cellular level,
which as you know, is pretty darn tiny.

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:49.920
And, the work of converting the stuff in food, into the
stuff that’s in my body, is done by my digestive system.

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.960
Human digestion occurs in six main steps -- some of
which you are intimately familiar with. Others less so.

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.979
But every step of the way, your body is working
to reduce all the different kinds of molecules

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:03.139
in food into their tiniest and most basic
forms.

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.980
The first step? Is, uh, probably everybody’s favorite.

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:23.400
When it comes to what your digestive system ultimately
does, just think of it as a sort of disassembly line.

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.200
You could have an order of nachos with The
Works -- I’m talking beef and onions and

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.740
sour cream and slices of jalapeño -- and
your digestive system will deconstruct it,

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:35.120
both mechanically and chemically, one step
at a time.

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.820
It’s gotta do this because your cells work best
with materials that are in their most basic form.

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:44.380
Your digestive system reduces food to that
level in two main ways: by physically smashing

00:02:44.389 --> 00:02:49.049
it to smithereens, and by bathing them, as
much as it can, in enzymes.

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:53.599
Enzymes are proteins that living things use
as catalysts, to speed up chemical reactions.

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:57.459
When used in digestion, enzymes break down
the large molecules in your food into the

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:00.059
building blocks that your cells can actually
absorb.

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:03.879
Those large molecules are called biological
molecules -- also known as macromolecules

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:07.719
-- and everything that you eat, I hope, is
at least partially made of them.

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:13.180
And there are four main kinds: you got the lipids, the
carbohydrates, the proteins, and the nucleic acids.

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.560
Each possesses its own density of chemical
potential energy, or caloric value, like for

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:23.040
example, 1 gram of carbohydrate contains about 4
calories, while a gram of fat contains about 9 calories.

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.500
But many of these biological molecules are
polymers -- or sequences of smaller molecules

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.680
-- and your cells aren’t really equipped
to take them up whole.

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.939
What your body trafficks in are those polymers’
individual components -- called monomers -- and

00:03:34.939 --> 00:03:39.619
there are four main kinds of those, too: fatty
acids, sugars, amino acids, and nucleotides.

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:44.220
The simple idea behind the whole digestive system
is to break down the polymers of macromolecules

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:48.930
in your food, into the smaller monomers that
your cells can use to build their own polymers,

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:50.810
while also getting the energy they need.

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:53.839
And, what your body needs to build at any
given moment is always changing.

00:03:53.839 --> 00:03:57.969
Maybe you need new fat stores so you can have
energy to run a marathon, or new actin and

00:03:57.969 --> 00:04:02.480
myosin to build bigger muscles, or more DNA
so you can replace the skin cells you scraped

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:07.680
off your knee when you fell, or more enzymes so you
can digest more food to get more building materials.

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:13.260
To meet your body’s constant, and constantly shifting
demands, your digestive system requires a lot of organs

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:18.380
that perform a lot of specific tasks to break down
and absorb the right nutrient at the right time.

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:21.220
Now, I’m quite sure that you’re familiar
with the key players here -- they’re the

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:27.189
hollow organs that form the continuous tube
that is your alimentary canal, aka the gastrointestinal

00:04:27.189 --> 00:04:29.840
tract, which runs from your mouth to your
anus.

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:35.200
It’s worth pointing out that these organs are
hollow, because you are basically hollow, too.

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:41.660
Your digestive tract is really just one unbroken,
insulated tunnel of outside that just happens

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:46.809
to run through your body, and is open at both
ends. You’re a donut.

00:04:46.809 --> 00:04:51.920
So the layer of stratified squamous and columnar
epithelial cells that line your tract is actually

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:56.599
a barrier between the outside world and your
inside world -- but it’s a barrier that

00:04:56.599 --> 00:04:59.340
allows for the selective movement of materials
between them.

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:03.080
It’s these hollow organs that do the actual
moving, digesting, and absorbing of food,

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:07.800
and they include your mouth, pharynx, esophagus,
stomach, and small and large intestines.

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:11.430
In your mouth, in your esophagus, and at the
other end of things, at your anus, you have

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:16.370
stratified squamous epithelial tissue, just
like your epidermis, to help resist the abrasive

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:19.090
action of like, chewing, like corn chips, maybe.

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:23.640
From your stomach on down, though, the inner
GI tract is lined with simple columnar epithelial

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:28.310
cells, which secrete all sorts of stuff, and
which absorb and process various nutrients.

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:32.000
Most of those columnar cells secrete mucus,
which lubricates everything, and protects

00:05:32.009 --> 00:05:35.120
your cells from being digested by your own
digestive enzymes.

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:39.599
So, the innermost epithelial layer of the
tube is known as the mucosal layer, and it

00:05:39.599 --> 00:05:42.960
contains some connective tissue as well, which
supplies it with blood.

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:47.600
Surrounding the mucosal layer is the submucosal
layer, made of loose areolar connective tissue,

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:51.380
which helps provide the elasticity that the
tube needs when you eat a whole pizza in one

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:53.740
sitting, and it contains more blood vessels.

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:58.569
And outside that, you have the muscularis
externa layer, which as you might guess, is

00:05:58.569 --> 00:06:02.280
where you find the muscles responsible for
moving food through your tube.

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:06.990
Beyond these layers, the GI tract gets tons
of support from the accessory digestive organs,

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:11.120
like your teeth, and your tongue, your gallbladder,
salivary glands, liver, and pancreas.

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:14.620
They’re kind of like a pit crew, and they
mostly help by secreting various enzymes that

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:16.870
help take apart food as it comes down the
tube.

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:21.289
Together, these two groups on the digestive
disassembly line work in six steps to destroy

00:06:21.289 --> 00:06:24.269
your food and release and recycle its nutrients.

00:06:24.269 --> 00:06:28.140
First, of course, you’ve got to introduce
the food to your digestive system. What you

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:32.919
know as eating, or ingestion, is basically
just creating a bulk flow of nutrients from

00:06:32.919 --> 00:06:35.019
the outside world into your tissues.

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:39.840
This is where the work of disassembly begins:
In your face-hole, which scientists call your mouth.

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:42.620
Now, we’re going to get to the details of
what happens here another time, but remember

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:47.849
that food disassembly is both mechanical and
chemical: So your teeth pulverize the bite

00:06:47.849 --> 00:06:53.329
of nacho or whatever, while your salivary glands
begin that food’s hours-long enzyme bath.

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:57.110
But the food, at this point, is not nearly
“micro” enough to be of any use to your

00:06:57.110 --> 00:07:00.430
cells, so you have to move that mush further
down your tube.

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:04.600
This stage is called propulsion, and its initial
mechanism is swallowing -- which, as you know,

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:09.400
is a voluntary action -- but then it’s quickly turned
over to the involuntary process of peristalsis.

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:13.539
In peristalsis, the smooth muscles of the
walls of your digestive organs take turns

00:07:13.539 --> 00:07:18.839
contracting and relaxing to squeeze food through
the lumen, or cavity, of your alimentary tract.

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:23.180
Waves of peristalsis continue through the
esophagus, stomach, and intestines, and they’re

00:07:23.189 --> 00:07:26.939
so strong that even if you were hanging upside
down while eating your lunch and drinking

00:07:26.939 --> 00:07:33.659
your tea, the food would still soldier on, fighting
gravity, and eventually make it to its final destination.

00:07:33.659 --> 00:07:38.039
Don’t do that, though. There’s other reasons
why you shouldn’t be upside down.

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:42.100
Anyway, all of this shipping and handling
mechanically breaks down the food even more,

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:46.370
and even after it goes through the stomach
and its gastric acid, the mechanical work

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:51.099
still continues once it reaches your small
intestine, as more smooth muscle segments

00:07:51.099 --> 00:07:53.949
push the food back and forth to keep crumbling
it up.

00:07:53.949 --> 00:07:59.200
The goal of all this pulverization is to increase the
surface area of that bite of food by breaking it down

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:05.960
into increasingly tiny pieces, to prepare it to encounter
more enzymes in step four: chemical digestion.

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:10.300
Really, the actual process of digestion only
occurs when the main action becomes

00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:12.200
more chemical than mechanical.

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:17.259
And here, the accessory digestive organs -- namely,
the liver, pancreas and gallbladder -- secrete

00:08:17.259 --> 00:08:22.009
enzymes into the alimentary canal, where they
ambush the mush and break it down into its

00:08:22.009 --> 00:08:23.949
most basic chemical building blocks.

00:08:23.949 --> 00:08:28.209
Like I said before, our cells prefer to do
business in the really basic currency of monomers,

00:08:28.209 --> 00:08:33.309
like amino acids, fatty acids, and simple sugars.
And digestion allows for the absorption of

00:08:33.310 --> 00:08:39.070
those nutrients as they pass from the small intestine
into the blood, by both active and passive transport.

00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:43.110
Once those nutrients are absorbed by your
cells, you can finally use the energy inside

00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:45.430
of them or use them to build new tissues.

00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:49.000
The absorption of the nutrients is the
goal of the entire process.

00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:51.330
But, of course, it is not the end of it.

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:55.990
Once your body has sucked out all the nutrients
it wants, indigestible substances like fiber

00:08:55.990 --> 00:08:57.740
are escorted out of your body.

00:08:57.740 --> 00:09:00.260
Yeah, I’m talking about pooping, or defecation.

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:05.000
And that is the end of the digestive line
-- unless you are a capybara, or one of the

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.380
other animals who make sure that they get
the most out of their lunch, by giving the

00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:14.130
whole process another round and practicing
coprophagia, aka eating their own poop.

00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:18.400
Now, you should notice here that some of the
processes of digestion occur in just one place,

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:22.600
and are the job of a single organ -- like
hopefully you’re only ingesting through

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:25.520
your mouth and eliminating from the large
intestine.

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:29.190
But most of these six steps require cooperation
among multiple organs.

00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:32.930
For example, both mechanical and chemical
digestion start in the mouth, and continue

00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:36.710
through the stomach and small intestines.
And some chemical breakdown continues in the

00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:39.770
large intestine, thanks to our little bacterial
farm there.

00:09:39.770 --> 00:09:43.220
Over the next couple of weeks we’re going
to take you and your nachos on a stroll through

00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:47.870
your digestive system and see who’s doing
what, where, how, and why.

00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:50.770
But for now, I’ve got some nachos to finish,
so I gotta go.

00:09:50.770 --> 00:09:55.370
And eating those nachos, as you learned today,
will provide me with energy and raw materials,

00:09:55.370 --> 00:09:59.330
by first ingesting something nutritious, propelling
it through my alimentary canal where it will

00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:04.060
be mechanically broken down, and chemically
digested by enzymes until my cells can absorb

00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:09.020
their monomers and use them to make whatever
they need. And eventually, there will be pooping.
