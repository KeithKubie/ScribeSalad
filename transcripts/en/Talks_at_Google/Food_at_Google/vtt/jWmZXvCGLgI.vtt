00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:03.660
FEMALE SPEAKER: Today,
you're clearly all

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:08.590
as excited as me to have Chef
Dominique Crenn at Google.

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:12.150
She is the chef and owner of
Atelier Crenn and Petit Crenn,

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.360
both in the city.

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.090
Also holds the
prestigious honor of being

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:20.640
the first female chef in the US
to receive two Michelin stars.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.720
Her newest, and I think
first, cookbook, Metamorphosis

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.260
of Taste is out today.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.949
You're going to have the
privilege of accessing that,

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:29.990
probably in the back of
the room in a little bit.

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:33.388
So please join me in welcoming
Chef Crenn to Google.

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:40.540
DOMINIQUE CRENN: Thank
you for having me.

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.280
Who cooks at home here?

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.880
I don't.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:44.380
That's good.

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.160
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.340
What are you guys
cooking at home?

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.980
What are you looking for when
you're buying a cookbook?

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.640
AUDIENCE: A lot of pictures.

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:55.598
DOMINIQUE CRENN: Great.

00:00:55.598 --> 00:00:57.930
Because there's a lot
of pictures on this.

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:58.430
All right.

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:03.690
So the idea of-- I didn't
want to write a cookbook.

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:10.790
I just wanted to write a book,
but you have to make a deal.

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:13.460
So anyway.

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.590
This book is not about for
you guys to follow the recipe.

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.330
It's for you guys to be inspired
with [INAUDIBLE] and about

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.510
my life and about the way that
I'm thinking about things.

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.400
My philosophy is about
anything you do in life,

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.690
you have to think
before to do something.

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:35.790
So always thinking
before cooking.

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:44.160
And cooking is a way to
for me to express myself.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.790
I'm not just opening
restaurants to open restaurants.

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.570
I think it's kind of
boring to do this.

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:52.430
Actually Crenn was a place.

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:56.900
It's a very special place.

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:04.646
In 2009, I had a major accident
where I almost lost my life.

00:02:04.646 --> 00:02:06.650
And then I woke up.

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:09.919
Obviously I did wake up
because I'm here today.

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:12.480
But I realized that
life is too short,

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.715
and I wanted to
do something that

00:02:16.715 --> 00:02:19.986
embraced the way that I'm
looking at life, the way

00:02:19.986 --> 00:02:21.110
that I'm looking at people.

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.350
So I wanted to create a
place where I could gather

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.930
a lot of talents around me.

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.150
And to bring a vision and
a philosophy up to life.

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.490
It was not an idea
about, I'm a chef.

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:37.890
I'm going to open a restaurant,
because I have a lot of egos.

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.160
That was not the idea, which
I think a lot of people do.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.670
But I'm not.

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.020
No, it was really a place
to bring people together

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.630
to be able for them to have a
platform to express themselves.

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:54.520
And obviously, to have
the same idea that I have.

00:02:54.520 --> 00:03:01.890
And to just have fun, and
maybe with that restaurant,

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.730
we can start to have a dialogue
with people in the city

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.230
and in the world
about everything.

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.510
Cooking and food for me
is the core of a society.

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.170
Means that everything
that comes from food also

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.880
there is economy.

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:18.510
There is social economy.

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.729
There is way of thinking,
there is humanity,

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:22.770
there is a lot of things.

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:25.630
So I'm thinking like,
I'm not too cerebral,

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:26.880
but I'm a little bit cerebral.

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:31.300
So this is how we think.

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:35.390
And it's also at Atelier Crenn,
we want to have a lot of fun.

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:36.520
We wake up in the morning.

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.350
We work 18 hours a day.

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:42.490
And we drink a lot
of wine at night.

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:43.530
And we just laugh.

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.880
And it's not a
regular kitchen where

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:48.820
the chef is yelling a lot.

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:51.040
It's a kitchen where there
is a lot-- I mean here,

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.780
I'm sure there's a
lot of talented people

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.620
that you guys exchange
ideas every day.

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:59.320
And I think we do the same
thing, and I think it's great.

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.640
So I don't know what
we're going to do today.

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:03.730
I've got 35 minutes to go.

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:06.480
That's amazing.

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:12.250
So every dish that we
do at Atelier Crenn,

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:15.970
you're not going to find them
anywhere else in the world.

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:23.430
No dish is an inspiration of
any books or any cook recipe

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.640
that you see online.

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:28.600
It's a reflection
of the way that we

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.800
think, the way that we feel.

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:35.740
And maybe memories that
happened also through our lives.

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.230
I mean, obviously,
I grew up in France.

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:41.150
Some of my cooks grew
up somewhere else.

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:44.460
So I always like to integrate
a little bit of their DNA

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.705
into my cooking, which I
think is very important.

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:53.620
Who's been to France before?

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:57.020
I love that.

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:58.970
Did you go to France
and eat hamburger,

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:01.220
or did you go to France
and eat French food?

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:02.770
I don't know.

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:03.570
It's interesting.

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:09.490
So do you guys know that there
is a tradition in France where,

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:14.480
especially at the table, it's
totally different than here

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:15.040
in America.

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:18.590
In America, I mean,
when you start a meal,

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:21.750
I think people start
with salads, right?

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:22.930
I never understood that.

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:25.720
In France, the salad is
at the end of the meal

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:30.220
to kind of bring lightness
and to help you to digest.

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:31.910
So we have a salad.

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:36.110
We finish the meal with
a salad at Atelier Crenn

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:38.060
before starting with
the desert, which

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:42.160
is about seven
desserts after that.

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:44.620
Who's been to Atelier Crenn?

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:47.020
Oh, OK.

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:49.140
When?

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:52.214
I I know I get a lot of Google
people, but when was that?

00:05:52.214 --> 00:05:52.880
Did you like it?

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:54.890
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I
was there last year.

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:56.490
DOMINIQUE CRENN: Good.

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:57.385
Anybody complain?

00:05:57.385 --> 00:05:58.010
Any complaints?

00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:58.270
No?

00:05:58.270 --> 00:05:58.770
OK.

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:01.490
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:04.850
So the way that we
think about things is,

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:08.800
how can we do a salad
without being a boring salad

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:10.580
with just lettuce and vinegar?

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:14.740
So we take ideas.

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:15.900
And so, what is a salad?

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:21.090
A salad is composed with a lot
of different greens and baby

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:22.660
vegetables.

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:23.860
So this is pretty big.

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:25.850
You see, it's like really tiny.

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:31.560
And we have a garden where we
take all the baby vegetables

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:32.990
and salad.

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:34.410
and so what is a salad?

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:36.569
There's a vinaigrette.

00:06:36.569 --> 00:06:37.110
I don't know.

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:39.790
It could be ranch vinaigrette,
which is not French,

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:42.880
so we don't do that.

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:46.160
Usually, the regular, the
classical vinaigrette in France

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:49.620
is just Banyuls vinegar with
a little bit of olive oil,

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:52.300
and sometimes a
touch of mustard,

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:54.920
which we're not
going to have today.

00:06:54.920 --> 00:07:00.910
So I wanted to bring,
in one bite, the feeling

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:04.510
and the emotion of
eating a salad, which

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:12.300
is a touch of earthiness
from the lettuce.

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:16.240
Obviously, a touch of
acidity with the vinegar,

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:19.710
and a touch of the
sweetness, because I

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:22.530
feel that when
you eat something,

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:27.440
you need to have all the texture
of life, which is sweetness,

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:30.072
acidity, and earthiness.

00:07:30.072 --> 00:07:31.280
There is more than that also.

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:34.260
There is love, and whatever.

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:42.062
Anyway, so this dish, you
can't make it in 31 minutes.

00:07:42.062 --> 00:07:43.145
There is a lot of process.

00:07:43.145 --> 00:07:47.450
It takes us up to
24 hours to make it.

00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:49.260
So there is two ways we can do.

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:50.420
I can walk through.

00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:53.131
Maybe I'll just walk
them through it.

00:07:53.131 --> 00:07:53.840
All right.

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:57.770
So first, the idea was
to make a meringue.

00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:01.833
And you're like, what?

00:08:01.833 --> 00:08:02.660
A meringue?

00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:05.960
This is not good.

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:10.870
So the meringue for us
was to create a vessel

00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:12.000
to hold the salad.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.220
So this is how we're
making the meringue.

00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:20.930
It's made with a lot
of interesting things.

00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:26.210
It's made with Banyuls vinegar,
sugar, a different type

00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:28.910
of hydrocolloid.

00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:35.159
The is also glucose and egg
white, an all those things.

00:08:35.159 --> 00:08:37.940
So you bring them together.

00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:39.520
The reason we use
some hydrocolloid

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:44.059
is to stabilize the meringue and
the xanthan gum and all that.

00:08:44.059 --> 00:08:48.750
And we dehydrate the meringue
for up to five hours.

00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:53.710
And so this meringue
is not really sweet.

00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:55.490
It tastes like Banyuls.

00:08:55.490 --> 00:08:58.710
So that is my base for the
vinegar, Banyuls vinegar.

00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:01.816
So what we do with it, we
just make a little boat.

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:08.030
My cooks love me, because it
takes them about two hours

00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:12.280
to make those meringues.

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:17.330
And if the base is not
right, then the meringue

00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:19.420
will not dehydrate properly.

00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:21.940
And then when you have
50 people at night,

00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:23.710
and if it's not
ready, and if I don't

00:09:23.710 --> 00:09:28.110
serve that for my customer,
then the chef gets very angry.

00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:30.680
So it's very intense.

00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:32.705
So this is the best.

00:09:32.705 --> 00:09:34.630
It's a meringue Banyuls.

00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:37.626
Then we make Banyuls gel.

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:41.440
You can do this at home.

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:42.148
It's pretty easy.

00:09:42.148 --> 00:09:45.970
I mean, you can use
any type of vinegar.

00:09:45.970 --> 00:09:47.400
You can use agar-agar.

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:48.990
Which is very simple.

00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:53.130
Make sure you dried
the agar-agar.

00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:55.910
And then you just
kind of broke the gel.

00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:58.600
Agar-agar is found anywhere.

00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:00.790
You can find it in any store.

00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:04.690
I wanted to have, also,
life is about also feeling.

00:10:04.690 --> 00:10:08.190
So this is a feeling of like,
you can eat also the vinegar.

00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:10.900
I will make everybody
taste, individually, this.

00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:15.520
And then we made,
also, an olive oil gel.

00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:21.880
And this is made with
eggs, yolk, and olive oil.

00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:23.530
We vacuum.

00:10:23.530 --> 00:10:27.820
Basically, we mix the
egg yolk, we vacuum it.

00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:30.860
And then we add a little bit
of water to stabilize it.

00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:34.440
And then add the olive oil, and
then we make a gel out of it.

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:40.430
So this is really the component
of oil and vinegar vinaigrette.

00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:42.050
Very easy.

00:10:42.050 --> 00:10:45.730
And this is a vessel.

00:10:45.730 --> 00:10:48.510
So the way we do
this in-- do you

00:10:48.510 --> 00:10:49.900
guys want to taste
the gel first,

00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:54.940
before I-- Just go a little
bit around, and then just put

00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:57.730
a little bit on your finger.

00:10:57.730 --> 00:10:59.760
Please make sure you
don't put too much so you

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:02.020
can share with everyone.

00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:07.540
And then this is the olive
oil, so people can taste it.

00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:09.360
So Banyuls vinegar
is a French vinegar.

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:14.878
You can get it, I
think, Whole Foods.

00:11:14.878 --> 00:11:18.610
Whole Foods has it,
which is surprising,

00:11:18.610 --> 00:11:19.450
but I think they do.

00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:25.940
I think maybe
Rainbow also has it.

00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:27.070
Maybe.

00:11:27.070 --> 00:11:29.260
I don't know if you
can find it at-- I

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:31.240
don't shop at Safeway or those.

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:32.378
I don't, so I'm sorry.

00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:40.210
I don't like big corporations,
and mall food is also bad.

00:11:40.210 --> 00:11:43.720
I mean, this is a
big corporation.

00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:46.845
This is not what I'm saying.

00:11:46.845 --> 00:11:48.780
Did you guys taste the vinegar?

00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:50.250
Where's the vinegar?

00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:51.670
AUDIENCE: The vinegar is here.

00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:52.503
DOMINIQUE CRENN: OK.

00:11:52.503 --> 00:11:54.630
Just did you give that
to them over there?

00:11:54.630 --> 00:11:55.270
Oh yeah.

00:11:55.270 --> 00:11:56.350
Did you taste it?

00:11:56.350 --> 00:11:57.190
No?

00:11:57.190 --> 00:11:59.060
I think it's important.

00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:04.216
I think if you want to cook
at home and a little bit more

00:12:04.216 --> 00:12:08.440
out there, that's why
I also wrote the book.

00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:11.380
You know, it's all
about that inspiration.

00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:13.380
And then if you have
little techniques

00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:17.060
to integrate in your dinner
with friends, I think it's fun.

00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:21.390
You know, those meringues,
you can make those.

00:12:21.390 --> 00:12:25.660
Obviously, I don't know if you
can find those hydrocolloids

00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:26.480
at the store.

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:28.880
You're going to have
to order them online.

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:32.700
You can make regular meringue.

00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:35.320
The reason why we use those
hydrocolloids, because we

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:38.260
use vinegar, which is acidic.

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:42.230
And you can make just regular
meringue, put them in the oven.

00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:44.250
Or you can dehydrate
it overnight.

00:12:44.250 --> 00:12:46.000
Just have a lot of
fun with it, and just

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.710
make whatever vinaigrette or
gel that you want, you know?

00:12:48.710 --> 00:12:53.390
I think it's all about
bringing new, fun things to do.

00:12:53.390 --> 00:12:56.080
So did you guys
taste everything?

00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:58.890
Do you guys taste the olive oil?

00:12:58.890 --> 00:13:02.210
Takes a long time.

00:13:02.210 --> 00:13:04.260
Do you guys have
any other questions?

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:06.150
AUDIENCE: And is
it the poem first?

00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:06.983
DOMINIQUE CRENN: OK.

00:13:06.983 --> 00:13:10.050
So I started to write poetry
when I was four years old.

00:13:10.050 --> 00:13:13.460
And that's how I expressed
myself about life.

00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:17.310
And then I never
believed to write a menu,

00:13:17.310 --> 00:13:20.230
because I think it's boring
to look at the ingredients.

00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:22.280
I don't know.

00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:27.220
So I started to write
poetry before doing--

00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:30.830
it was a kind of a feeling of
what I felt for the season.

00:13:30.830 --> 00:13:33.250
And then the dishes came after.

00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:39.090
But now it's very 50-50.

00:13:39.090 --> 00:13:45.000
I wrote a menu in
the spring of 2012

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.180
before to do anything else.

00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:50.940
I was taking care of a little
girl that had leukemia.

00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:54.890
And she passed away
right before spring time,

00:13:54.890 --> 00:13:57.500
and the menu was the
point was all about her.

00:13:57.500 --> 00:14:00.320
And all the dishes just
follow up after that.

00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:05.065
So it used to be before,
and now it's just now.

00:14:05.065 --> 00:14:06.940
I can write you a poem
right now if you want.

00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:11.470
So yeah.

00:14:11.470 --> 00:14:15.510
It's kind of like, a poem,
you can follow the dish.

00:14:15.510 --> 00:14:17.900
I mean, usually every
dish is as a line,

00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:23.100
but it's also we want people
to just come there, and just

00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:26.320
have fun, and enjoy the food.

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:29.680
And the poem, you can
read it before or after.

00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:33.490
But it's just a way of
interacting with you guys.

00:14:33.490 --> 00:14:34.713
You've never been to Atelier?

00:14:34.713 --> 00:14:35.460
AUDIENCE: Several times.

00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:36.205
DOMINIQUE CRENN: Oh.

00:14:36.205 --> 00:14:37.280
AUDIENCE: We go for
our anniversary.

00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:37.910
DOMINIQUE CRENN: Oh.

00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:38.528
My customer.

00:14:38.528 --> 00:14:41.245
Right here.

00:14:41.245 --> 00:14:42.828
What was the last
time you were there?

00:14:42.828 --> 00:14:44.657
AUDIENCE: February
11th of this year.

00:14:44.657 --> 00:14:45.490
DOMINIQUE CRENN: Oh.

00:14:45.490 --> 00:14:48.310
So February 11.

00:14:48.310 --> 00:14:49.380
OK.

00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:52.080
Oh, menu's totally
different right now.

00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:55.330
Where's my olive oil?

00:14:55.330 --> 00:14:56.170
AUDIENCE: Over here.

00:14:56.170 --> 00:14:57.545
DOMINIQUE CRENN:
Oh, you like it.

00:14:57.545 --> 00:14:59.240
You want to keep it.

00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:01.020
Did you guys try the Banyuls?

00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:02.790
Yeah?

00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:03.545
Is it good?

00:15:03.545 --> 00:15:03.870
AUDIENCE: It's very good.

00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:04.260
Yeah.

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:05.510
DOMINIQUE CRENN: Who tried it?

00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:07.190
Who didn't try it?

00:15:07.190 --> 00:15:09.200
The meringue?

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:10.269
Everybody?

00:15:10.269 --> 00:15:11.060
Oh, you're sharing.

00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:12.732
That's so nice of you.

00:15:12.732 --> 00:15:13.390
All right.

00:15:13.390 --> 00:15:15.310
So this is what we do.

00:15:15.310 --> 00:15:18.500
So we take the meringue,
we make a little boat.

00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:20.760
Like a little bit, a hole.

00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:26.350
And then we just put
the Banyuls gel on top,

00:15:26.350 --> 00:15:32.750
mix it with a little
bit of olive oil gel.

00:15:32.750 --> 00:15:42.380
And then from the garden,
which is yours, then

00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:46.980
we try to-- you had
the salad, right?

00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:47.480
OK.

00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:48.450
Many times, right?

00:15:48.450 --> 00:15:50.310
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:15:50.310 --> 00:15:51.476
DOMINIQUE CRENN: How was it?

00:15:51.476 --> 00:15:52.250
AUDIENCE: Fantastic.

00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:53.374
DOMINIQUE CRENN: Fantastic.

00:15:53.374 --> 00:15:54.290
I love that.

00:15:54.290 --> 00:15:58.290
And then we just add
whatever is in season.

00:15:58.290 --> 00:16:01.690
And I think what's important
for us, like I said,

00:16:01.690 --> 00:16:03.610
we have a little
garden upstairs,

00:16:03.610 --> 00:16:06.720
and outside also, where
we grew little greens,

00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:08.560
microgreens, some flowers.

00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:11.570
And when you make a salad,
what's interesting is,

00:16:11.570 --> 00:16:13.460
you don't take just
one type of lettuce.

00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:15.430
I think you need to mix it.

00:16:15.430 --> 00:16:18.360
Some need to be bitter, some
need to be more crunchy.

00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:21.500
And that's what's going
to make a beautiful salad.

00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:28.888
So if you just want to eat a
romaine salad, I don't know.

00:16:28.888 --> 00:16:29.387
Sorry.

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:44.850
Making a salad at Google.

00:16:44.850 --> 00:16:46.174
OK, so I think that's it.

00:16:46.174 --> 00:16:46.840
What do we have?

00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:50.860
Oh, we have a little kale here.

00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:58.170
And so this is how we serve it.

00:16:58.170 --> 00:17:02.080
Usually it comes on a wood,
whatever vessel we have.

00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:05.280
And then what we ask the
customer is to take this,

00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:11.040
and to eat it at once,
one bite, and then I

00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:12.720
think what you
experience is really

00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:17.804
the feeling of the emotion of
eating a salad without just

00:17:17.804 --> 00:17:18.560
in one bite.

00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:19.160
I don't know.

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:19.826
AUDIENCE: Fresh.

00:17:22.722 --> 00:17:25.599
AUDIENCE: It opens
up the menu, right?

00:17:25.599 --> 00:17:27.790
DOMINIQUE CRENN: It's
right at the end.

00:17:27.790 --> 00:17:31.030
Oh, you see she's been there.

00:17:31.030 --> 00:17:33.466
No, at the beginning of
the menu, it's Kir Breton.

00:17:33.466 --> 00:17:35.126
AUDIENCE: Oh, it's
the white chocolate.

00:17:35.126 --> 00:17:36.000
DOMINIQUE CRENN: Yes.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:41.110
To open up your--
explosion in your mouth.

00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:42.760
OK guys.

00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:48.140
AUDIENCE: How are the dishes
developed at Atelier Crenn?

00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:50.670
Is it like a collaborative
effort with your various chefs,

00:17:50.670 --> 00:17:54.854
or is it more driven by you?

00:17:54.854 --> 00:17:57.520
DOMINIQUE CRENN: Well I think at
the beginning of Atelier Crenn,

00:17:57.520 --> 00:18:00.910
it was definitely
more driven by me.

00:18:00.910 --> 00:18:04.230
I think when you
create a team, there

00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:09.820
is a lot of different
personalities, I would say.

00:18:09.820 --> 00:18:13.480
And I think you need to
come together as a team.

00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:18.930
And now it's really a
collaboration with my vision.

00:18:18.930 --> 00:18:24.340
So some dishes can take
four months to develop.

00:18:24.340 --> 00:18:29.010
For example, we had, I
will say, my pastry chef

00:18:29.010 --> 00:18:35.650
is about probably four,
sometimes five months.

00:18:35.650 --> 00:18:38.550
In pastry, what we
do, we take an idea.

00:18:38.550 --> 00:18:40.880
And then we create
our own vessel.

00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:46.040
So we had someone to-- I
need a tissue, because I

00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:48.190
think my nose is running.

00:18:48.190 --> 00:18:52.140
And I don't think it's sexy.

00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:52.890
Thank you.

00:18:52.890 --> 00:18:53.700
Sorry guys.

00:18:58.220 --> 00:18:59.430
Kidding.

00:18:59.430 --> 00:19:04.350
So we try to do-- I
mean, you see there

00:19:04.350 --> 00:19:06.760
is a lot of different vessels.

00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:07.810
So we asked people.

00:19:07.810 --> 00:19:10.950
We like to involve other artists
to make the vessels or plates.

00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:14.420
Like, for example,
we had-- I don't

00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:18.390
know if you guys know anything
about bees in California,

00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:21.960
and the political aspect of it.

00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:24.370
And we need to save bees.

00:19:24.370 --> 00:19:25.980
I think it's very important.

00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:30.264
So we created a dessert to
bring awareness of that.

00:19:30.264 --> 00:19:31.180
And it's called honey.

00:19:31.180 --> 00:19:32.297
I don't know if you guys.

00:19:32.297 --> 00:19:32.880
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:36.360
So I just remembered we were
there in February and in May.

00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:39.180
And it was a dripping
honeycomb that was standing.

00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:41.890
DOMINIQUE CRENN: And then
you got the honey cake.

00:19:41.890 --> 00:19:44.320
And it was very
interesting, because we've

00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:48.530
been working with some honey
keepers back in Sonoma.

00:19:48.530 --> 00:19:53.390
And when we started to cook
the honey in the kitchen in San

00:19:53.390 --> 00:19:57.450
Francisco, then suddenly there
was like bees coming into-- it

00:19:57.450 --> 00:19:58.099
was crazy.

00:19:58.099 --> 00:19:59.390
It was coming into the kitchen.

00:19:59.390 --> 00:20:03.774
So dessert can take up
to four or five months.

00:20:03.774 --> 00:20:04.940
We have a dessert right now.

00:20:04.940 --> 00:20:06.023
I don't think you have it.

00:20:06.023 --> 00:20:08.680
It's called the forest.

00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:11.810
It's a celebration
of the forest.

00:20:11.810 --> 00:20:15.580
And it's a reproduction of
walking in the forest, which

00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:20.970
was a dish that we created
back in 2011 on the savory dish

00:20:20.970 --> 00:20:21.470
side.

00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:23.100
And now it's like sweet.

00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:27.720
And we had to have someone
to make the vessel for it,

00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:29.730
so it took about three months.

00:20:29.730 --> 00:20:35.830
Some other dishes can take,
I don't know, two minutes.

00:20:35.830 --> 00:20:36.720
No, I'm kidding.

00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:38.090
That's a joke.

00:20:38.090 --> 00:20:40.230
No everything is
very thoughtful.

00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:42.190
You know, I think we
don't want to throw dishes

00:20:42.190 --> 00:20:43.350
that don't mean anything.

00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:48.110
So I think often when
we think about season,

00:20:48.110 --> 00:20:50.930
is it's not just about the food.

00:20:50.930 --> 00:20:53.500
It's about the idea,
and the feeling,

00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:55.490
and the emotion around it.

00:20:55.490 --> 00:20:56.990
You know, I think
we live in a world

00:20:56.990 --> 00:21:02.871
right now that is, I think
the world is in trouble.

00:21:02.871 --> 00:21:03.370
I'm sorry.

00:21:03.370 --> 00:21:05.360
I'm going to be very
political right now.

00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:07.410
And climate change and all that.

00:21:07.410 --> 00:21:10.120
So everything that, I
think, the next menu

00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:14.250
is going to be very focused
on bringing those awareness

00:21:14.250 --> 00:21:16.000
through our own dishes.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.290
So it takes a
little bit of time.

00:21:18.290 --> 00:21:21.250
And I'm very
fortunate and I'm very

00:21:21.250 --> 00:21:24.260
lucky to have this
incredible team that

00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:25.620
has been working with me.

00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:28.830
I mean, we are a very small
team, and they work long hours.

00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:31.650
But I just love
the way they think.

00:21:31.650 --> 00:21:36.080
And it's very inspiring for me.

00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:39.215
AUDIENCE: I don't want
to hog the mic too much.

00:21:39.215 --> 00:21:41.420
One of my favorite
dishes, the vessel

00:21:41.420 --> 00:21:45.180
was a glass box with the leaves
inside of it with the bark.

00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:48.480
It was probably two
or three years ago.

00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:51.239
And it had the bubbler with
the tea, with the squash.

00:21:51.239 --> 00:21:52.280
DOMINIQUE CRENN: Oh, yes.

00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:52.779
Yes.

00:21:52.779 --> 00:21:54.820
AUDIENCE: And it was
like to represent fall.

00:21:54.820 --> 00:21:56.430
DOMINIQUE CRENN: Yeah, it was.

00:21:56.430 --> 00:21:57.270
It was summertime.

00:21:57.270 --> 00:21:58.996
Not kidding.

00:21:58.996 --> 00:22:00.120
AUDIENCE: I like this quiz.

00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:05.030
How do you even determine
the thought into the art?

00:22:05.030 --> 00:22:07.980
So it's like the bubbler.

00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:09.470
That is the tea, right?

00:22:09.470 --> 00:22:12.180
And then the tree that
came out of the glass box.

00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:14.760
Like all of that was
so thoughtful, right?

00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:18.080
So like that was a
vessel that I loved.

00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:20.090
I guess, maybe it's
your magic, right?

00:22:20.090 --> 00:22:22.160
Like transforming the
thought and the food

00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:24.127
into the presentation.

00:22:24.127 --> 00:22:25.960
DOMINIQUE CRENN: I don't
know if it's magic.

00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:28.210
But I think it's
about being conscious

00:22:28.210 --> 00:22:29.210
about your surroundings.

00:22:29.210 --> 00:22:31.850
And I thing, for us,
when you do something,

00:22:31.850 --> 00:22:35.286
you have to celebrate where
those things come from.

00:22:35.286 --> 00:22:37.530
For me, nature is number one.

00:22:37.530 --> 00:22:40.160
Nature and art, and
food is another thing.

00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:41.240
But like everything.

00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:46.130
So if you do a dish, is where
those ingredients come from,

00:22:46.130 --> 00:22:48.180
and what is the surrounding,
and what it means.

00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:51.335
We have also eucalyptus.

00:22:51.335 --> 00:22:52.710
Eucalyptus is a
plant, obviously,

00:22:52.710 --> 00:22:57.300
that comes from Australia, and
then was given to San Francisco

00:22:57.300 --> 00:22:58.100
a long time ago.

00:22:58.100 --> 00:23:00.890
And there's eucalyptus
tree all over.

00:23:00.890 --> 00:23:03.960
So it's also to celebrate
out surroundings.

00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:08.550
So we need to integrate those
to be a part of the story.

00:23:08.550 --> 00:23:11.340
Otherwise, I don't know.

00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:15.240
Otherwise, I'm just
another chef cooking food.

00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:16.720
It's kind of boring, I think.

00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:17.780
But whatever.

00:23:17.780 --> 00:23:19.280
But, yeah there is
a lot of thought.

00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:23.760
And once again, it is
being lucky to work with,

00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:27.241
like my pastry chef, we been
working together since 2006.

00:23:27.241 --> 00:23:28.240
And it's been a journey.

00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:34.840
And it's continuing to make
sure that everything we do

00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:37.150
is conscious and thoughtful.

00:23:37.150 --> 00:23:41.730
So being thoughtful is very
much the core of who we are.

00:23:41.730 --> 00:23:45.740
AUDIENCE: I know you have been
such an advocate for farmers,

00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:46.780
which is so amazing.

00:23:46.780 --> 00:23:49.242
Could you talk a little
bit about, maybe,

00:23:49.242 --> 00:23:51.200
one or two of your
relationships that you have,

00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:53.140
and kind of how that works?

00:23:53.140 --> 00:23:56.770
Like if it's a back
and forth relationship.

00:23:56.770 --> 00:23:58.630
It sounded like
with the honey one

00:23:58.630 --> 00:24:02.590
in Sonoma, like maybe
you offer ideas, perhaps,

00:24:02.590 --> 00:24:05.230
about what it is you
want and they provide it.

00:24:05.230 --> 00:24:06.964
Or is it a dialogue?

00:24:06.964 --> 00:24:08.380
DOMINIQUE CRENN:
It is a dialogue.

00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:10.880
So some background.

00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:13.080
So both of my parents
come from farmers.

00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:16.750
So I grew up kind of in that.

00:24:16.750 --> 00:24:19.330
And they're just amazing people.

00:24:19.330 --> 00:24:24.330
And I always say, farmers are
the rock stars, not the chef.

00:24:24.330 --> 00:24:26.890
It's very important to say
that, because it's true.

00:24:26.890 --> 00:24:30.700
No, I think with the farmers,
we do have a dialogue with them,

00:24:30.700 --> 00:24:35.220
but I feel that they know
things better than I know.

00:24:35.220 --> 00:24:40.940
So I always tell them to
give us whatever they have

00:24:40.940 --> 00:24:44.110
for us to be able to create.

00:24:44.110 --> 00:24:46.725
I don't want to tell
them what to do.

00:24:46.725 --> 00:24:48.792
They don't tell me
what to do, so I don't

00:24:48.792 --> 00:24:50.000
want to tell them what to do.

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:52.350
And there's a lot of chefs
that will go to a farmer

00:24:52.350 --> 00:24:54.860
and say, well you've
got to do this and this.

00:24:54.860 --> 00:24:59.390
I think when you understand
the makeup of a farm,

00:24:59.390 --> 00:25:02.820
there are things that you
might not be able to grow.

00:25:02.820 --> 00:25:05.509
And if you have pressure
to grow those things,

00:25:05.509 --> 00:25:06.550
I don't think that works.

00:25:06.550 --> 00:25:09.030
So we have a farm in Sonoma.

00:25:09.030 --> 00:25:11.340
Then I work with a lot
of different farmers

00:25:11.340 --> 00:25:14.530
most of the special
things that to grow

00:25:14.530 --> 00:25:18.490
and I just let them
do whatever they want.

00:25:18.490 --> 00:25:19.619
And I really love them.

00:25:19.619 --> 00:25:20.660
I think they are amazing.

00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:22.020
They're really cool people.

00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:23.760
Very humble too.

00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:25.830
We need them.

00:25:25.830 --> 00:25:27.980
So make sure next time
when you buy food,

00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:30.529
make sure you buy from a farmer.

00:25:30.529 --> 00:25:32.070
AUDIENCE: So I had
a similar question

00:25:32.070 --> 00:25:34.320
about when you decide where
to source things from.

00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:36.610
Like are you looking at
ethical farming practices?

00:25:36.610 --> 00:25:38.920
Like what thought goes
into your decision

00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:41.985
when you decide to source
an ingredient from somebody?

00:25:41.985 --> 00:25:42.860
DOMINIQUE CRENN: Yes.

00:25:46.502 --> 00:25:51.130
I think I said before,
not just for me,

00:25:51.130 --> 00:25:55.500
but I said before
that we all need

00:25:55.500 --> 00:26:00.110
to be advocates with
the way that we do.

00:26:00.110 --> 00:26:05.850
And then I think when you go
eat somewhere, it's an action.

00:26:05.850 --> 00:26:08.700
So I like to know where
my food comes from.

00:26:08.700 --> 00:26:12.450
I like to know the
practice of it.

00:26:12.450 --> 00:26:15.390
I understand some people will
argue that organic food is

00:26:15.390 --> 00:26:17.130
very expensive.

00:26:17.130 --> 00:26:19.870
But it's also, you
have farmers that

00:26:19.870 --> 00:26:26.180
do sustainable practice without
having organic practices.

00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:28.280
So yeah.

00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:30.710
Everything that we do and
everything that we have,

00:26:30.710 --> 00:26:31.970
actually, is.

00:26:31.970 --> 00:26:35.210
I mean, even the employee
meal is like all organic

00:26:35.210 --> 00:26:37.230
and is from farmers, and local.

00:26:37.230 --> 00:26:40.180
And as far as my
cheese, I don't know.

00:26:40.180 --> 00:26:44.300
I like French cheese, so I
buy my cheese from France.

00:26:44.300 --> 00:26:45.060
But no.

00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:48.070
Even any producer,
we talk to them.

00:26:48.070 --> 00:26:49.540
We know all the stories.

00:26:49.540 --> 00:26:50.770
We know everything behind it.

00:26:50.770 --> 00:26:52.990
And I think this
is very important.

00:26:52.990 --> 00:26:55.450
And that's, I think, that's
what the future's going to be.

00:26:55.450 --> 00:26:58.610
The future is not going to
be about industrial farming.

00:26:58.610 --> 00:27:01.580
The future is going to
be about small farming,

00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:03.004
but we need to support them.

00:27:03.004 --> 00:27:04.170
I think it's very important.

00:27:04.170 --> 00:27:06.780
And I know it's very expensive
to go to the farmer's market.

00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:08.196
The Ferry building--
I don't know.

00:27:08.196 --> 00:27:10.462
I live in San Francisco.

00:27:10.462 --> 00:27:11.170
But I don't know.

00:27:11.170 --> 00:27:14.260
I think we need to find
a system to make sure

00:27:14.260 --> 00:27:16.350
that if we want to
support them, they

00:27:16.350 --> 00:27:20.180
need to be in sync with us.

00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:22.160
Maybe the price needs--
maybe the government

00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:26.450
needs to be involved,
which is another story.

00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:31.810
AUDIENCE: My question
for you is, is there

00:27:31.810 --> 00:27:34.325
an ingredient that
when you see, you're

00:27:34.325 --> 00:27:36.620
just like, this is my favorite
ingredient to cook with.

00:27:36.620 --> 00:27:38.328
Or you love it, because
it's a challenge.

00:27:38.328 --> 00:27:40.960
Or it just makes your
day, and vice versa.

00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:42.410
Is there an
ingredient that you're

00:27:42.410 --> 00:27:45.090
just like, this ingredient, I
just don't like working with.

00:27:53.544 --> 00:27:54.710
DOMINIQUE CRENN: Red pepper.

00:27:54.710 --> 00:27:58.580
Yeah, like green pepper.

00:27:58.580 --> 00:28:01.510
I dislike those ingredients.

00:28:01.510 --> 00:28:02.950
I just don't.

00:28:02.950 --> 00:28:07.720
No, I think every
ingredient is beautiful.

00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:11.880
I like ingredients
that are not luxurious.

00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:15.820
I like ingredients that
are just on the dog.

00:28:15.820 --> 00:28:16.760
But, no.

00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:22.250
I don't like red paper,
or yellow, or green.

00:28:22.250 --> 00:28:26.315
It has puzzled me when I see,
when I ask chefs sometime when

00:28:26.315 --> 00:28:27.440
they put that on the plate.

00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:30.020
And it's like, well
this is for color.

00:28:30.020 --> 00:28:31.127
I just, I don't like that.

00:28:31.127 --> 00:28:32.710
So that's the
ingredient I don't like.

00:28:32.710 --> 00:28:35.250
It doesn't mean that I'm right.

00:28:35.250 --> 00:28:38.425
But my favorite
ingredient is tomato.

00:28:38.425 --> 00:28:39.860
So tomato, yes.

00:28:39.860 --> 00:28:41.380
I love tomato.

00:28:41.380 --> 00:28:44.825
Tomato could be a
vegetable, could be a fruit.

00:28:44.825 --> 00:28:46.310
So I love tomato.

00:28:46.310 --> 00:28:48.570
It has a lot of umami,
and it's just delicious,

00:28:48.570 --> 00:28:49.370
the texture of it.

00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:54.956
AUDIENCE: So we talked
about ingredients.

00:28:54.956 --> 00:28:56.630
That's kind of micro level.

00:28:56.630 --> 00:28:58.700
And on macro level, you
combine different dishes

00:28:58.700 --> 00:29:00.069
in a certain way.

00:29:00.069 --> 00:29:01.610
It sounds groundbreaking,
because you

00:29:01.610 --> 00:29:04.870
start with white chocolate,
then a main dish, than a salad.

00:29:04.870 --> 00:29:06.630
And can you talk
a little bit more

00:29:06.630 --> 00:29:08.810
about how you
combine different--?

00:29:08.810 --> 00:29:13.060
DOMINIQUE CRENN:
Well I think people

00:29:13.060 --> 00:29:16.740
need to think outside
of the box sometimes.

00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:20.170
I think we are in a society
when there is one way and not

00:29:20.170 --> 00:29:21.070
the other way.

00:29:21.070 --> 00:29:27.300
And it's like if you just
had a baby, you go to a store

00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:32.200
then this is girl clothing
and boys' clothing.

00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:34.340
I think everything
needs to be unisex.

00:29:34.340 --> 00:29:38.210
Anyway, that's how
I think about food.

00:29:38.210 --> 00:29:41.580
It's not just
chocolate needs to be

00:29:41.580 --> 00:29:43.470
in dessert, because
when you think

00:29:43.470 --> 00:29:44.899
about cocoa, what is cocoa?

00:29:44.899 --> 00:29:45.690
What is cocoa nibs?

00:29:45.690 --> 00:29:47.060
It's pretty bitter.

00:29:47.060 --> 00:29:51.020
So I like to mix
sweetness and bitterness.

00:29:51.020 --> 00:29:54.470
And I think that's interesting.

00:29:54.470 --> 00:29:58.260
It's the same thing when
we pair our food with wine.

00:29:58.260 --> 00:30:00.040
You know, it's
not like you can't

00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:02.790
have red wine with seafood.

00:30:02.790 --> 00:30:06.100
I say, yes you can.

00:30:06.100 --> 00:30:09.740
For us, it's just
finding the balance.

00:30:09.740 --> 00:30:14.340
We also understand the molecular
profile of every ingredient,

00:30:14.340 --> 00:30:17.830
which is quite interesting.

00:30:17.830 --> 00:30:20.500
You can mix cauliflower
with bleu cheese.

00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:21.455
It's delicious.

00:30:21.455 --> 00:30:24.070
Cauliflower and chocolate
is delicious also,

00:30:24.070 --> 00:30:27.210
because they have a very
similar molecular profile.

00:30:27.210 --> 00:30:28.472
So they go very well together.

00:30:28.472 --> 00:30:30.900
So it's also understanding.

00:30:30.900 --> 00:30:33.490
And some people will
nod, because it's

00:30:33.490 --> 00:30:35.740
all about education.

00:30:35.740 --> 00:30:38.950
And some things don't
work, but that's OK.

00:30:38.950 --> 00:30:40.280
But yeah.

00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:45.910
I mean, the first dish, it's a
frozen explosion of apple cider

00:30:45.910 --> 00:30:51.910
that is served with a reduction
of creme de cassis and cocoa

00:30:51.910 --> 00:30:53.610
butter.

00:30:53.610 --> 00:30:56.140
I don't think it's
sweet, but it's just--

00:30:56.140 --> 00:30:59.870
AUDIENCE: My question is
around inspiration, and where

00:30:59.870 --> 00:31:02.940
you kind of look for
a way to recharge,

00:31:02.940 --> 00:31:04.690
and renew your thinking.

00:31:04.690 --> 00:31:10.030
Because I think, whenever I look
around other areas of creation,

00:31:10.030 --> 00:31:12.530
I think there's always
ways and methods people

00:31:12.530 --> 00:31:13.870
kind of go back to the well.

00:31:13.870 --> 00:31:16.950
And kind of draw back and see
new things and new experiences

00:31:16.950 --> 00:31:18.260
that help create new stuff.

00:31:18.260 --> 00:31:21.329
So my question for you is,
what are those areas for you,

00:31:21.329 --> 00:31:22.870
where you kind of
go back to the well

00:31:22.870 --> 00:31:24.756
and see and recharge, renew.

00:31:24.756 --> 00:31:26.630
Whether it be like a
new season or a new menu

00:31:26.630 --> 00:31:28.080
that needs to come up?

00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:30.590
And I guess along those
lines, are there other chefs

00:31:30.590 --> 00:31:33.074
or other folks in
the food arena that

00:31:33.074 --> 00:31:34.490
are doing interesting
things right

00:31:34.490 --> 00:31:35.656
now that you think are cool?

00:31:35.656 --> 00:31:41.090
DOMINIQUE CRENN: Well I
mean, my personal inspiration

00:31:41.090 --> 00:31:43.435
is not about going to
a restaurant of food.

00:31:46.170 --> 00:31:46.984
I love museums.

00:31:49.830 --> 00:31:52.060
I love interesting movies.

00:31:52.060 --> 00:31:53.370
I love to talk to people.

00:31:53.370 --> 00:31:56.730
I love to be aware about
the different cultures.

00:31:56.730 --> 00:31:57.635
I love to travel.

00:32:01.340 --> 00:32:02.179
I'm still a baby.

00:32:02.179 --> 00:32:02.970
I'm still learning.

00:32:02.970 --> 00:32:05.400
So I think it's when
I go into the world,

00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:08.570
I've always got an open
mind, and see things

00:32:08.570 --> 00:32:11.970
that can draw my attention.

00:32:11.970 --> 00:32:16.710
And kind of spark
something inside of me.

00:32:16.710 --> 00:32:19.690
But it's interesting, because
I think I always go back

00:32:19.690 --> 00:32:27.120
to a piece of my memory that has
been triggered a long time ago.

00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:31.750
But I think it's very important
for me to be in the world

00:32:31.750 --> 00:32:34.430
and be inspired by
different artists.

00:32:34.430 --> 00:32:37.810
And even politics inspire me.

00:32:37.810 --> 00:32:43.026
I mean, making the honey
dessert was very political.

00:32:46.530 --> 00:32:52.110
And as I say, I mean, we don't
look into anything perfect.

00:32:52.110 --> 00:32:54.420
So when we do something,
it's not about perfection.

00:32:54.420 --> 00:32:55.650
It's really about evolution.

00:32:55.650 --> 00:32:57.700
So how do you achieve evolution?

00:32:57.700 --> 00:33:02.370
It's always to be in the
world and always learn.

00:33:02.370 --> 00:33:04.045
I'm sure that you
guys do that here too.

00:33:04.045 --> 00:33:04.920
It's about evolution.

00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:06.280
Google.

00:33:06.280 --> 00:33:08.440
Google was a few years ago.

00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:10.280
20 years ago?

00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:13.580
How long ago did it exist?

00:33:13.580 --> 00:33:14.790
20 years?

00:33:14.790 --> 00:33:15.400
Ten years?

00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:17.050
15 years?

00:33:17.050 --> 00:33:19.010
OK, so what Google
was 15 years ago

00:33:19.010 --> 00:33:20.290
is not what Google is today.

00:33:20.290 --> 00:33:22.190
And it's all about evolution.

00:33:22.190 --> 00:33:26.092
So this is why we think the
way we think in the kitchen.

00:33:26.092 --> 00:33:28.050
AUDIENCE: Do you have
any favorite restaurants?

00:33:31.330 --> 00:33:32.880
DOMINIQUE CRENN: Where?

00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:34.713
AUDIENCE: Either locally
or abroad, I guess.

00:33:37.670 --> 00:33:41.290
DOMINIQUE CRENN: So my favorite
restaurant in the United States

00:33:41.290 --> 00:33:45.790
is Blue Eel Stone Farm.

00:33:45.790 --> 00:33:48.150
If you don't know
anything about Ben Barber,

00:33:48.150 --> 00:33:50.810
I will recommend to just
read a little bit about him

00:33:50.810 --> 00:33:53.449
and his way of cooking.

00:33:53.449 --> 00:33:53.990
It's amazing.

00:33:57.760 --> 00:33:58.560
San Francisco.

00:33:58.560 --> 00:34:01.850
There's a lot of great
restaurants in San Francisco.

00:34:01.850 --> 00:34:04.620
Where do I hang out?

00:34:04.620 --> 00:34:05.120
Anywhere.

00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:05.820
Zuni Cafe.

00:34:05.820 --> 00:34:08.000
I was a local in
there last night.

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:12.560
But in the world, one of
my favorite restaurants

00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:15.150
is Michel Bras in
Laguiole in France.

00:34:15.150 --> 00:34:19.580
I love Quique Dacosta
in Denia, Valencia.

00:34:19.580 --> 00:34:23.322
Andoni is the chef of
Mugaritz in San Sebastian.

00:34:26.630 --> 00:34:31.530
This is places that
I like, but I'm

00:34:31.530 --> 00:34:34.380
fond to-- there's a lot of
restaurants that I love.

00:34:34.380 --> 00:34:40.590
I think I admire chefs and cooks
that go out there, and speak,

00:34:40.590 --> 00:34:42.960
and dialogue with us
with their own food.

00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:43.770
And being personal.

00:34:43.770 --> 00:34:47.230
So I'm just very open.

00:34:47.230 --> 00:34:50.460
And then my restaurant
is very good too.

00:34:50.460 --> 00:34:53.590
You know, I've got to
tell you, every day when

00:34:53.590 --> 00:34:56.250
I work at Atelier, when
I'm done with Atelier,

00:34:56.250 --> 00:34:59.110
I go to Petit Crenn,
and I sit at the bar.

00:34:59.110 --> 00:35:00.930
And this is mine.

00:35:00.930 --> 00:35:01.970
It's a lot, you know.

00:35:01.970 --> 00:35:05.720
And I get a glass of wine,
or rose, and some oysters.

00:35:05.720 --> 00:35:07.985
And I feel at home, and
I think that's important.

00:35:07.985 --> 00:35:09.610
But there's a lot of
great restaurants.

00:35:09.610 --> 00:35:13.550
I mean, it's pretty humbling
to be in a city that

00:35:13.550 --> 00:35:16.790
has so many talented people.

00:35:16.790 --> 00:35:18.792
And I feel lucky
to be a part of it.

00:35:18.792 --> 00:35:21.125
FEMALE SPEAKER: I think I
speak for everyone when I say,

00:35:21.125 --> 00:35:22.544
what an inspiration you are.

00:35:22.544 --> 00:35:24.960
And what a treat it's been to
spend a little time with you

00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:25.793
here this afternoon.

00:35:25.793 --> 00:35:27.100
So thank you.

00:35:27.100 --> 00:35:29.109
And we'll give you
a round of applause.

00:35:29.109 --> 00:35:31.150
DOMINIQUE CRENN: I don't
think you've ever done--

00:35:31.150 --> 00:35:34.800
[APPLAUSE]
