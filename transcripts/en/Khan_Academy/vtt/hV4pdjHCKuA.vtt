00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:03.190
This is the same problem that
we had in the last video.

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:05.620
But instead of trying to figure
out whether the data

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:08.200
supplies sufficient evidence to
conclude that the engines

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.760
meet the actual emissions
requirement, and all of the

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.220
hypothesis testing, I thought I
would also use the same data

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:18.170
that we had in the last video to
actually come up with a 95%

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:19.460
confidence interval.

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.620
So you could ignore the
question right here.

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:23.080
You can ignore all of this.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.040
I'm just using that same data
to come up with a 95%

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.960
confidence interval for the
actual mean emission for this

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.310
new engine design.

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:40.200
So we want to find a 95%
confidence interval.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.790
And as you could imagine,
because we only have 10

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:46.770
samples right here, we're
going to want to use a

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:47.960
T-distribution.

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.450
And right down here
I have a T-table.

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:53.740
And we want a 95% confidence
interval.

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:59.750
So we want to think about the
range of T-values that 95-- or

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.050
the range that 95% of T-values
will fall under.

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:04.190
So let's think about this way.

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:05.180
So let me draw a

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:11.660
T-distribution right over here.

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:14.260
So a T-distribution looks
very similar to a normal

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:18.210
distribution but it
has fatter tails.

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.400
This end and this end will be
fatter than in a normal

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.630
distribution.

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.510
And then we want to find an
interval, so if this is a

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:29.150
normalized T-distribution the
mean is going to be 0.

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.720
And we want to find interval
of T-values between some

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.740
negative value here and some
positive value here that

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:41.850
contains 95% of the
probability.

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.030
So this right here
has to be 95%.

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.330
And to figure what these
critical T-values are at this

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.930
end and this end, we can
just use a T-table.

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.280
And we're going to use the
two-sided version of this

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.470
because we're symmetric
around the center.

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.700
So you look at the two-sided,
we want a 95% confidence

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.260
interval, so we're going to
look right over here, 95%

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:04.340
confidence interval.

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.190
We have 10 data points,
which means we have

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:09.570
9 degrees of freedom.

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:12.330
So 9 degrees of freedom for
our 10 data points.

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.980
We just took 10 minus 1.

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:19.220
So if we look over here, so for
a T-distribution with 9

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.950
degrees of freedom, you're
going to have 95% of the

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.090
probability is going to be
contained within a T-value

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.320
of-- so the T-value is going
to be between negative, so

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:34.250
this value right here is 2.262,
and this value right

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.620
here is negative 2.262.

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.620
That's what this right
here tells us.

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.960
That if you contain all the
values that are less than

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:48.070
2.262 away from the center of
your T-distribution, you will

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:52.160
contain 95% of the
probability.

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.130
So that is our T-distribution
right there.

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:55.010
Let me make it very clear.

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:56.260
This is our T-distribution.

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.280
So if you randomly pick
a T-value from this

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:10.020
T-distribution, it has a 95%
chance of being within this

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.930
far from the mean.

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:12.100
Or maybe we should
write this way.

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:17.290
If I pick a random T-value, if
I take a random T-statistic--

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:23.970
let me write it this way--
there's a 95% chance that a

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:33.430
random T-statistic is going
to be less than 2.262, and

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:40.210
greater than negative 2.262.

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:43.850
95% percent chance.

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:49.420
Now when we took this sample, we
could also derive a random

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:50.960
T-statistic from this.

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:54.130
We have our sample mean and our
sample standard deviation,

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:57.690
our sample mean here is

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:01.060
17.17-- figured that out in the
last video, just add these

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:03.640
up, divide by 10-- and
our sample standard

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:07.950
deviation here is 2.98.

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:11.300
So the T-statistic that we can
derive from this information

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:13.080
right over here-- so let me
write it over here-- the

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.870
T-statistic that we could derive
from this, and you can

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.790
view this T-statistic as being
a random sample from a

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:20.769
T-distribution.

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:23.000
A T-distribution with 9
degrees of freedom.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.430
So the T-statistic that we
could derive from that is

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:34.810
going to be our mean, 17.17
minus the true mean of our

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:35.780
population.

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:39.190
Or actually you would say the
true mean of our sampling

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:41.640
distribution, which is also
going to be the same as the

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:45.190
true mean of our population,
because that's our population

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:52.080
mean over there, divided by s,
which is 2.98 over the square

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.790
root of our number of samples.

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:56.140
We've seen this multiple
times.

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:58.520
This right here is
the T-statistic.

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.820
So by taking this sample you
can say that we've randomly

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:05.070
sampled a T-statistic from
this 9 degree of freedom

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:06.200
T-distribution.

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:11.130
So there's a 95% chance that
this thing right over here is

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:17.420
going to be between-- is going
to be less than 2.262 and

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:20.920
greater than negative 2.262.

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:30.450
So the 95% probability still
applies to this right here.

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:33.840
Now we just have to do some
math, calculate these things.

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:36.300
So let me get my
calculator out.

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:41.470
And so let me just
calculate this

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:42.680
denominator right over here.

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:50.130
So we have 2.98 divided by
the square root of 10.

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:55.160
So that's 0.9423.

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:58.100
So what I'm going to do is I'm
going to multiply both sides

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:01.230
of this equation by this
expression right over here.

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:05.940
So if I do that-- so let me just
do that right over-- so

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:08.820
if I multiply this entire-- this
is really two equations

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:11.100
or two inequalities
I should say.

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:13.130
That this quantity is greater
than this quantity and that

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:14.750
this quantity's greater
than that quantity.

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:17.050
But we can operate on all of
them at the same time, this

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:18.730
entire inequality.

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:20.400
So what we want to do is
multiply this entire

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:24.710
inequality by this value
right over here.

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:27.410
And we just calculated it at
that value-- let me write it

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:31.010
over here-- that 2.98-- I'll
write it right over here--

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:39.500
2.98 over the square root
of 10 is equal to 0.942.

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:45.010
So if I multiplied this entire
inequality by 0.942 I get, on

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:53.490
this left-hand side over here
I have negative 2.262 times

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:58.160
0.942-- and it's a positive
number that we're multiplying

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:00.510
the whole inequality by, so the
inequality signs are still

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:03.770
going to be in the same
direction-- is less than--

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:07.990
we're multiplying this whole
expression by the same

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:10.780
expression in the denominator
so it'll cancel out.

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:16.090
So we're just going to be less
than 17.17 minus our

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:22.610
population mean, which is going
to be less than 2.262

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:27.740
times, once again, 0.942.

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:30.190
Let me scroll over to the
right a little bit.

00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:33.170
0.942.

00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:37.260
Just be clear, I'm just
multiplying all three sides of

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:40.160
this inequality by this number
right over here.

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:41.650
In the middle this
cancels out.

00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:45.940
So if I multiply-- I'll just
write it over here-- 0.942,

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:51.010
0.942, 0.942.

00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:53.740
This and this is the same number
so that's why those

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:54.530
cancel out.

00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:56.180
And now let's get the calculator
to figure out what

00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:57.930
these numbers are.

00:07:57.930 --> 00:08:02.560
So if we have the 0.942
times 2.262.

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:10.080
So we're going to say
times 2.262 is 2.13.

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:14.800
So this number right
over here on the

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:21.100
right-hand side is 2.13.

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:23.130
This number on the left is just
the negative of that.

00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:27.610
So it's negative 2.13.

00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:31.320
And then we still have our
inequalities-- is going to be

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:39.090
less than 17.17 minus the mean,
which is less than 2.13.

00:08:39.090 --> 00:08:40.549
Now what I want to do is
I actually want to

00:08:40.549 --> 00:08:42.520
solve for this mean.

00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:44.070
And I don't like that negative
sign in the mean.

00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:45.580
I'd rather have this
swapped around.

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:48.810
I'd rather have the
mean minus 17.17.

00:08:48.810 --> 00:08:50.660
So what I'm going to do is
multiply this entire

00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:52.880
inequality by negative 1.

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:55.910
If you do that, if you multiply
the entire thing

00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:58.620
times negative 1, this quantity
right here, this

00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:02.550
negative 2.13 will become
a positive 2.13.

00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:05.940
But since we are multiplying
an inequality by a negative

00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:08.080
number you have to swap
the inequality sign.

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:10.660
So this less than will become
a greater than.

00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:14.970
This negative mu will become
a positive mu.

00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:20.300
This positive 17.17 will become
a negative 17.17.

00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:22.890
We're going to have to swap this
inequality sign as well,

00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:28.010
and this positive 2.13 will
become a negative 2.13.

00:09:28.010 --> 00:09:28.640
And we're almost there.

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:31.120
We just want to solve for mu.

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:33.580
Have this inequality expressed
in terms of mu.

00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:37.370
So what we can do is now just
add 17.17 to all three sides

00:09:37.370 --> 00:09:44.990
of this inequality, and we are
left with 2.13 plus 17.17 is

00:09:44.990 --> 00:09:49.810
greater than mu minus 17.17 plus
17.17 is just going to be

00:09:49.810 --> 00:09:54.090
mu, which is greater than-- so
this is greater than mu, which

00:09:54.090 --> 00:10:00.950
is greater than negative
2.13 plus 17.17.

00:10:00.950 --> 00:10:03.910
Or a more natural way to write
it since we actually have a

00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:05.830
bunch of greater than signs,
that this is actually the

00:10:05.830 --> 00:10:08.780
largest number and this-- oh
sorry, this is actually the

00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:12.140
smallest number and this over
here is actually the largest

00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:14.520
number, is actually flipped--
you can just re-write this

00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:15.970
inequality the other way.

00:10:15.970 --> 00:10:19.860
So now we can write-- actually
let's just figure out what

00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:20.740
these values are.

00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:27.900
So we have 2.13 plus 17.17.

00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:32.010
So that is the high
end of our range.

00:10:32.010 --> 00:10:34.280
So that is 19.3.

00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:40.392
So this value right over here,
so this is 19-- let me do it

00:10:40.392 --> 00:10:46.210
in that same color-- this value
right here is 19.3 is

00:10:46.210 --> 00:10:51.010
going to be greater than mu,
which is going to be greater

00:10:51.010 --> 00:10:54.910
than-- and this is negative
2.13 plus 17.17.

00:10:54.910 --> 00:11:08.460
Or we could have 17.17 minus
2.13, which gives us 15.04.

00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:11.810
And remember, the whole thing,
all of this, we started with,

00:11:11.810 --> 00:11:16.530
there was a 95% chance that a
random T-statistic will fall

00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:18.720
in this interval.

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:21.160
We had a random T-statistic,
and all we did

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:22.060
is a bunch of math.

00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:26.160
So there's a 95% chance that any
of these steps are true.

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:29.830
So there's a 95% chance
that this is true.

00:11:29.830 --> 00:11:33.990
There's a 95% chance that the
true population mean, which is

00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:36.850
the same thing as the mean of
the sampling distribution of

00:11:36.850 --> 00:11:40.180
the sample mean, there's a 95%
chance, or that we are

00:11:40.180 --> 00:11:43.780
confident that there's a 95%
chance, that it will fall in

00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:44.750
this interval.

00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:46.280
And we're done.
