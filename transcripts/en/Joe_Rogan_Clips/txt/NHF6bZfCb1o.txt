Speaker 1:          00:00          The Joe Rogan experience. The worst is if you try to valet a stick shift. I tried, I tried to give a valley my keys to my bronco and he didn't know what to do. I go, you don't know how to drive a stick shift. He goes, no. I go, what the fuck are you doing here man? How can you have this job? Yeah. Yeah. That should be a part of the resume.
