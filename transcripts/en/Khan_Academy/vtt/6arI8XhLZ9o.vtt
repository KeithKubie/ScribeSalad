00:00:00.159 --> 00:00:03.461
- [Instructor] We're told
that f of x is equal to two x

00:00:03.461 --> 00:00:06.249
times the square root of five minus four.

00:00:06.249 --> 00:00:09.577
And we're also told that g
of x is equal to x squared

00:00:09.577 --> 00:00:13.299
plus two x times the square
root of five minus one.

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:16.524
And they want us to find g minus f

00:00:16.524 --> 00:00:17.535
of x.

00:00:17.535 --> 00:00:18.856
So pause this video,

00:00:18.856 --> 00:00:22.137
and see if you can work
through that on your own.

00:00:22.137 --> 00:00:25.606
So the key here is to just
realize what this notation means.

00:00:25.606 --> 00:00:26.773
G minus f of x

00:00:27.816 --> 00:00:30.066
is the same thing as g of x

00:00:31.884 --> 00:00:33.428
minus

00:00:33.428 --> 00:00:34.261
f of x.

00:00:35.191 --> 00:00:37.476
And so, again, if this was helpful to you,

00:00:37.476 --> 00:00:40.449
once again I encourage
you to pause the video.

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:42.176
All right, now let's
work through this again.

00:00:42.176 --> 00:00:44.122
So this is going, or,
I guess the first time,

00:00:44.122 --> 00:00:45.171
but now that we know

00:00:45.171 --> 00:00:47.690
that this is equal to g of x minus f of x.

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:48.996
So what is g of x?

00:00:48.996 --> 00:00:53.080
Well, that's the same thing
as x squared plus two x

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.940
times the square root of five minus one.

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.514
And what is f of x?

00:00:58.514 --> 00:01:01.485
Well, it's going to be two x

00:01:01.485 --> 00:01:04.407
times the square root of five minus four.

00:01:04.407 --> 00:01:07.150
And we are subtracting f of x from g of x.

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.310
So let's subtract, this
is f of x, from g of x.

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:11.248
And so now it's just going

00:01:11.248 --> 00:01:13.077
to be a little bit of
algebraic simplification.

00:01:13.077 --> 00:01:15.333
So this is going to be equal to,

00:01:15.333 --> 00:01:16.666
this is equal to

00:01:17.575 --> 00:01:21.573
x squared plus two x times
the square root of five

00:01:21.573 --> 00:01:22.705
minus one.

00:01:22.705 --> 00:01:26.011
And now we just have to
distribute this negative sign.

00:01:26.011 --> 00:01:28.282
So negative one times two x

00:01:28.282 --> 00:01:29.477
times the square root of five is,

00:01:29.477 --> 00:01:32.648
we're gonna have minus two x
times the square root of five.

00:01:32.648 --> 00:01:36.197
And then the negative of
negative four is positive four.

00:01:36.197 --> 00:01:38.407
Now let's see if we
can simplify this some.

00:01:38.407 --> 00:01:39.613
So this is going to be equal to,

00:01:39.613 --> 00:01:41.517
we only have one x squared term,

00:01:41.517 --> 00:01:42.808
so that's that one there.

00:01:42.808 --> 00:01:44.320
So we have x squared.

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.007
Now let's see, we have two x
times the square root of five.

00:01:47.007 --> 00:01:48.365
And then we have another, oh,

00:01:48.365 --> 00:01:50.496
and then we subtract two x
times the square root of five.

00:01:50.496 --> 00:01:53.265
So these two cancel out with each other.

00:01:53.265 --> 00:01:54.701
So those cancel out.

00:01:54.701 --> 00:01:57.784
And then we have minus one plus four.

00:01:58.877 --> 00:02:02.198
So if we have negative one
and then we add four to it,

00:02:02.198 --> 00:02:03.956
we're going to have positive three.

00:02:03.956 --> 00:02:05.055
So if we just fact,

00:02:05.055 --> 00:02:07.602
if we take this and
this into consideration,

00:02:07.602 --> 00:02:10.381
four minus one is going
to be equal to three,

00:02:10.381 --> 00:02:11.290
and we're done.

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.856
That's what g minus f of x is equal to,

00:02:13.856 --> 00:02:15.136
x squared plus three.
