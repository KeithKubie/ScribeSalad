00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.129
Imagine waiting for a new lung or kidney transplant
… you finally get one, go through intense

00:00:05.129 --> 00:00:09.309
surgery, and then after a few years, your
body’s like NOPE I DON’T LIKE THIS THING,

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:11.869
GET IT OUT and rejects that vital organ.

00:00:11.869 --> 00:00:13.179
... heartbreaking, right?

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:16.080
Transplant rejection happens, and more often
than you’d think.

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.060
About 50% of all transplanted organs are rejected
within 10-12 years.

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:22.700
That’s a staggering number.

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:27.680
Organ rejection happens at the molecular level,
something just isn’t compatible, and finally,

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.260
scientists think they’ve uncovered the basis
of this response.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.270
This is a-metaphorically-huge-but-literally
microscopic-thing!

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:38.460
So we have to understand how the body deals
with a foreign lung or liver or whatever.

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.620
And that relationship starts with the immune
system.

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.579
So, let’s say you’re getting a new kidney
… It’s a whole ecosystem of living things.

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:47.090
And it’s ALIEN.

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:51.310
The immune system knows this because the cells
on the donor organ are different . But once

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:53.940
it knows, it’s definitely not going to ignore
it.

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.239
As far as the immune system is concerned it
could be a giant virus or poison!

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.270
So, it tries to get rid of it!

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.600
Your immune system is designed to attack anything
it doesn’t recognize.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.689
And there are two main parts within the human
immune system that are responsible for this

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:09.770
1-2 punch: the innate immune system and the
adaptive immune system.

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.899
The adaptive immune system response is what
you think of, when you think “immune system.”

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:15.399
This is defcon 1.

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:17.600
White blood cells, are ready to attack the
invader.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:18.600
SHIT IS GETTIN’ REAL.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.810
But, white bloods don’t just attack anything.

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:21.359
They need a snitch.

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:23.319
They need to be told what to attack.

00:01:23.319 --> 00:01:27.270
That’s what’s been elusive for scientists,
the triggers for the innate immune system

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.270
response.

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.479
How do the t-cells get fired up enough to
attack your shiney new organ?

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:33.909
Bear with me, we’re about to get real molecular.

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:38.100
In a paper published in Science Immunology,
they found that t-cells won't launch an offensive

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.770
unless another immune cell, called a Dendritic
cell, yells, “intruder alert!”

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.409
Dendritic cells are on the lookout for a molecule
called SIRP-alpha.

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.399
If your kidney is put in my body, the SIRP-alpha
don’t match.

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:55.509
When they aren’t a match, a receptor on
a monocyte called CD47 binds to that SIRP-alpha

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:56.509
protein…

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:59.039
The monocytes are another type of immune cells.

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:03.329
Once that binding happens, the dendritic cell
rings the alarm and the big guns roll in...

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.679
and that’s what causes organ rejection.

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:09.970
Basically a protein interaction sets off a
chain reaction that eventually leads to bye,

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:10.970
bye, kidney.

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.010
The exciting part of this nitty-gritty molecular
discovery is that researchers think they can

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.569
block that interaction between the SIRP-alpha
and CD47.

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:23.980
Basically, the monocytes never get bound up,
so the immune system stays cool.

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.420
This could prevent organ rejection and lead
to acceptance!

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.140
But more research is needed.

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:33.319
Plus, now that we know to look for it, we
can match the SIRP-alpha from donors and recipients,

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:36.880
possibly causing lower organ rejection rates
overall!

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.110
Being on a list for an organ for years, only
to have it rejected is devastating for the

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.299
recipient, but think about it -- maybe that
kidney could have worked in someone else!

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:49.569
The more we know about this process, the better
we’ll be able to get organs to their forever

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:53.469
homes, and keep them safe inside the crazy
neighborhood that is the human body.

It’s hard enough to transplant a singular
organ, but some scientists are actually trying

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:17.810
to transplant a human head..

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:19.650
Or I guess a whole human body?

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.560
