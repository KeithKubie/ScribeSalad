gave us this header to set this cookie, which

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:13.230
of these domains are allowed to set this

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.708
cookie? And these are the same domains from

00:00:15.708 --> 00:00:20.617
before, udacity.com, ide.udacity.com, other.ide.udacity.com

00:00:20.617 --> 00:00:22.610
or other.udacity.com. And the

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:25.238
domain for the cookie is, of course, is ide.udacity.com.
