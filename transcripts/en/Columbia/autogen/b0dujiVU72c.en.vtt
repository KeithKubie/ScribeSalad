00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:09.900
process contaminated them and in fact
 

00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:11.420
process contaminated them and in fact
would limit the utility of the

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:14.570
indicators my my view has in fact
 

00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:17.720
indicators my my view has in fact
changed rather markedly over time in

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:17.730
changed rather markedly over time in
 

00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:20.420
changed rather markedly over time in
fact a change rather quickly as we

00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:20.430
fact a change rather quickly as we
 

00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:23.270
fact a change rather quickly as we
started working on an assessment of the

00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:23.280
started working on an assessment of the
 

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:25.760

evaluators so what I hope to explain to

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:25.770
evaluators so what I hope to explain to
 

00:08:25.770 --> 00:08:28.610
evaluators so what I hope to explain to
you in my time today is why that's the

00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:28.620
you in my time today is why that's the
 

00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:31.040
you in my time today is why that's the
case and talk to you about some of the

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:31.050
case and talk to you about some of the
 

00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:33.680
case and talk to you about some of the
research that we have done to look at

00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:33.690
research that we have done to look at
 

00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:37.219
research that we have done to look at
the indicators so what my colleague

00:08:37.219 --> 00:08:37.229
the indicators so what my colleague
 

00:08:37.229 --> 00:08:40.880
the indicators so what my colleague
tutor Vlad and our students have done is

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:40.890
tutor Vlad and our students have done is
 

00:08:40.890 --> 00:08:44.960
tutor Vlad and our students have done is
subject the press freedom indices to

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:44.970
subject the press freedom indices to
 

00:08:44.970 --> 00:08:47.829
subject the press freedom indices to
standard analysis using the criteria of

00:08:47.829 --> 00:08:47.839
standard analysis using the criteria of
 

00:08:47.839 --> 00:08:51.740
standard analysis using the criteria of
reliability and validity and this is

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:51.750
reliability and validity and this is
 

00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:53.300
reliability and validity and this is
obviously rather straightforward but

00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:53.310
obviously rather straightforward but
 

00:08:53.310 --> 00:08:55.170
obviously rather straightforward but
it's something that had not been done

going to talk about that here today and
more recently we have looked at the

more recently we have looked at the
 

00:09:46.149 --> 00:09:48.150
more recently we have looked at the

so the first question we asked was of

00:10:08.769 --> 00:10:08.779
so the first question we asked was of
 

00:10:08.779 --> 00:10:11.769
so the first question we asked was of
the reliability of the measures and what

00:10:11.769 --> 00:10:11.779
the reliability of the measures and what
 

00:10:11.779 --> 00:10:15.940
the reliability of the measures and what
we found is that the in fact for all of

00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:15.950
we found is that the in fact for all of
 

00:10:15.950 --> 00:10:18.610
we found is that the in fact for all of
these indicators they are reliable

00:10:18.610 --> 00:10:18.620
these indicators they are reliable
 

00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:21.760
these indicators they are reliable
across time and as would be expected the

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:21.770
across time and as would be expected the
 

00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:24.280
across time and as would be expected the
reliability decreases in a systematic

reliability decreases in a systematic
 

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:26.079
reliability decreases in a systematic
fashion across time that is the

00:10:26.079 --> 00:10:26.089
fashion across time that is the
 

00:10:26.089 --> 00:10:29.079

year-to-year correlations are much
 

00:10:29.089 --> 00:10:31.570
year-to-year correlations are much
higher than they are as one moves across

higher than they are as one moves across
 

00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:35.530
higher than they are as one moves across

time the obvious expectation if the
 

00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:39.340
time the obvious expectation if the
measures are going to first reliably or

00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:39.350
measures are going to first reliably or
 

00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:41.380
measures are going to first reliably or
consistently measure a phenomenon and

00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:41.390
consistently measure a phenomenon and
 

00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:44.290
consistently measure a phenomenon and
then reflect change we also found that

00:10:44.290 --> 00:10:44.300
then reflect change we also found that
 

00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:45.760
then reflect change we also found that
in the case in which there are

barometer we could not look at measures
 

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:08.650

dramatic and keep periods of time we
 

00:11:49.050 --> 00:11:51.439
dramatic and keep periods of time we
looked at the way the measure changed as

00:11:51.439 --> 00:11:51.449
looked at the way the measure changed as
 

00:11:51.449 --> 00:11:54.560
looked at the way the measure changed as
Soviet Union dissolved and in fact it

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:54.570
Soviet Union dissolved and in fact it
 

00:11:54.570 --> 00:11:57.259
Soviet Union dissolved and in fact it
meaningfully reflects that change and we

00:11:57.259 --> 00:11:57.269
meaningfully reflects that change and we
 

00:11:57.269 --> 00:11:58.879
meaningfully reflects that change and we
also looked at the Warsaw Pact countries

00:11:58.879 --> 00:11:58.889
also looked at the Warsaw Pact countries
 

00:11:58.889 --> 00:12:02.960
also looked at the Warsaw Pact countries
as they became more independent and

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:02.970
as they became more independent and
 

00:12:02.970 --> 00:12:06.530
as they became more independent and
moved into the Western sphere and again

00:12:06.530 --> 00:12:06.540
moved into the Western sphere and again
 

00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:08.569
moved into the Western sphere and again
the Freedom House measure was our focus

00:12:08.569 --> 00:12:08.579
the Freedom House measure was our focus
 

00:12:08.579 --> 00:12:10.160
the Freedom House measure was our focus
because it's the only one that existed

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:10.170
because it's the only one that existed
 

00:12:10.170 --> 00:12:11.900
because it's the only one that existed
through that period of time and it

00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:11.910
through that period of time and it
 

00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:14.660
through that period of time and it
accurately reflects the expected change

00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:14.670
accurately reflects the expected change
 

00:12:14.670 --> 00:12:17.810
accurately reflects the expected change
period we also have been working with a

00:20:26.149 --> 00:20:26.159
cases is one time a year but there are a
 

00:20:26.159 --> 00:20:27.739
cases is one time a year but there are a
core number of items that they try to

core number of items that they try to
 

00:20:27.749 --> 00:20:29.419
core number of items that they try to
use in all of those countries now they

00:20:29.419 --> 00:20:29.429
use in all of those countries now they
 

00:20:29.429 --> 00:20:31.459
use in all of those countries now they
that they can't use them in all cases

00:20:31.459 --> 00:20:31.469
that they can't use them in all cases
 

00:20:31.469 --> 00:20:34.579
that they can't use them in all cases
because in some cases they're simply not

00:20:34.579 --> 00:20:34.589
because in some cases they're simply not
 

00:20:34.589 --> 00:20:36.739
because in some cases they're simply not
allowed by the government in some cases

00:20:36.739 --> 00:20:36.749
allowed by the government in some cases

says that they can't actually be asked
but what we were able to do is to get an

but what we were able to do is to get an
 

00:20:47.699 --> 00:20:52.129
but what we were able to do is to get an
item into the core for 2010 that says to

item into the core for 2010 that says to
 

00:20:52.139 --> 00:20:53.659

the world public opinion item to them
 

00:20:58.190 --> 00:21:00.859
the world public opinion item to them
but this is the variant that they were

but this is the variant that they were
 

00:21:00.869 --> 00:21:03.799
but this is the variant that they were
willing to feel they say that many of

willing to feel they say that many of

items that this is the variant it came

00:21:13.099 --> 00:21:13.109
items that this is the variant it came
 

00:21:13.109 --> 00:21:16.699
items that this is the variant it came
out so in 2010 that item appeared for

00:21:16.699 --> 00:21:16.709
out so in 2010 that item appeared for
 

00:21:16.709 --> 00:21:18.949
out so in 2010 that item appeared for
the first time in the core and we have

00:21:18.949 --> 00:21:18.959
the first time in the core and we have
 

00:21:18.959 --> 00:21:20.629
the first time in the core and we have
data now for more than a hundred

data now for more than a hundred
 

00:21:20.639 --> 00:21:23.329

countries but I got the data for about

00:21:23.329 --> 00:21:23.339
countries but I got the data for about
 

00:21:23.339 --> 00:21:26.869
countries but I got the data for about
50 of them only two days ago so we have

00:21:26.869 --> 00:21:26.879
50 of them only two days ago so we have
 

00:21:26.879 --> 00:21:30.499
50 of them only two days ago so we have

can see some of the countries there but

00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:41.760
can see some of the countries there but
 

00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:44.170
can see some of the countries there but
what we're looking at here and this

obviously at this point we have no idea

00:22:00.950 --> 00:22:00.960
obviously at this point we have no idea
 

00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:02.720
obviously at this point we have no idea
whether what kind of lag might be

00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:02.730
whether what kind of lag might be
 

00:22:02.730 --> 00:22:04.340
whether what kind of lag might be
appropriate we only have data for one

00:22:04.340 --> 00:22:04.350
appropriate we only have data for one
 

00:22:04.350 --> 00:22:06.560
appropriate we only have data for one
year in terms of the Gallup data so we

00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:06.570
year in terms of the Gallup data so we
 

00:22:06.570 --> 00:22:09.290
year in terms of the Gallup data so we
looked at the 10 by 10 relationship and

00:22:09.290 --> 00:22:09.300
looked at the 10 by 10 relationship and
 

00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:12.560
looked at the 10 by 10 relationship and
the R is negative 43 which is a positive

00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:12.570
the R is negative 43 which is a positive
 

00:22:12.570 --> 00:22:16.750
the R is negative 43 which is a positive
43 we have respected the Preferences of

00:22:16.750 --> 00:22:16.760
43 we have respected the Preferences of
 

00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:19.640
43 we have respected the Preferences of
rsf and Freedom House for negative

00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:19.650
rsf and Freedom House for negative
 

00:22:19.650 --> 00:22:22.160
rsf and Freedom House for negative
scoring and consequently a negative is a

00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:22.170
scoring and consequently a negative is a
 

00:22:22.170 --> 00:22:25.730
scoring and consequently a negative is a
positive in in the analysis and you can

00:22:25.730 --> 00:22:25.740
positive in in the analysis and you can
 

00:22:25.740 --> 00:22:27.650
positive in in the analysis and you can
see the pattern you can see some

00:22:27.650 --> 00:22:27.660
see the pattern you can see some
 

00:22:27.660 --> 00:22:29.570
see the pattern you can see some
outliers and I'm just going to go very

00:22:29.570 --> 00:22:29.580
outliers and I'm just going to go very
 

00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:31.670
outliers and I'm just going to go very
quickly through this but this is the 9 x

00:22:31.670 --> 00:22:31.680
quickly through this but this is the 9 x
 

00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:33.560

00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:40.170
Gallup data for 2010 again the only year
 

00:22:40.170 --> 00:22:43.370
Gallup data for 2010 again the only year
for which we have data and although we

00:22:43.370 --> 00:22:43.380
for which we have data and although we
 

00:22:43.380 --> 00:22:45.560
for which we have data and although we
will have more that item is remained in

00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:45.570
will have more that item is remained in
 

00:22:45.570 --> 00:22:48.530
will have more that item is remained in
the core for 2011 and so we filled it

00:22:48.530 --> 00:22:48.540
the core for 2011 and so we filled it
 

00:22:48.540 --> 00:22:51.020
the core for 2011 and so we filled it
throughout this year as well and the

00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:51.030
throughout this year as well and the
 

00:22:51.030 --> 00:22:53.300
throughout this year as well and the
correlation is very comfortable putting

00:22:53.300 --> 00:22:53.310
correlation is very comfortable putting
 

00:22:53.310 --> 00:22:55.760
correlation is very comfortable putting
44 so a modest correlation we're

00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:55.770
44 so a modest correlation we're
 

00:22:55.770 --> 00:22:59.090
44 so a modest correlation we're
encouraging is the correlation with the

00:22:59.090 --> 00:22:59.100
encouraging is the correlation with the
 

00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:01.820
encouraging is the correlation with the
Freedom House measure from 2009 with the

00:23:01.820 --> 00:23:01.830
Freedom House measure from 2009 with the

00:23:03.769 --> 00:23:03.779
Gallup measure from 2010
 

00:23:03.779 --> 00:23:06.019
Gallup measure from 2010
and we're waiting on Karen's report for

00:23:06.019 --> 00:23:06.029
and we're waiting on Karen's report for
 

00:23:06.029 --> 00:23:09.830
and we're waiting on Karen's report for
2010 to see what that happens when we go

00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:09.840
2010 to see what that happens when we go
 

00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:11.629
2010 to see what that happens when we go
year by year it makes some sense that

00:23:11.629 --> 00:23:11.639
year by year it makes some sense that
 

00:23:11.639 --> 00:23:13.339
year by year it makes some sense that
there would be a lag but as I said we

00:23:13.339 --> 00:23:13.349
there would be a lag but as I said we
 

00:23:13.349 --> 00:23:15.379
there would be a lag but as I said we
have no theoretical argument about what

00:23:15.379 --> 00:23:15.389
have no theoretical argument about what
 

00:23:15.389 --> 00:23:17.869
have no theoretical argument about what
that lag should be you can see there are

00:23:17.869 --> 00:23:17.879
that lag should be you can see there are
 

00:23:17.879 --> 00:23:20.389
that lag should be you can see there are
some interesting outliers and these

00:23:20.389 --> 00:23:20.399
some interesting outliers and these
 

00:23:20.399 --> 00:23:22.219
some interesting outliers and these
would be the cases in which we would say

00:23:22.219 --> 00:23:22.229
would be the cases in which we would say
 

00:23:22.229 --> 00:23:25.099
would be the cases in which we would say
that some measure of public opinion

00:23:25.099 --> 00:23:25.109
that some measure of public opinion
 

00:23:25.109 --> 00:23:28.310
that some measure of public opinion
would contribute to the understanding of

00:23:28.310 --> 00:23:28.320
would contribute to the understanding of
 

00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:29.690
would contribute to the understanding of
press freedom that is if you look at

00:23:29.690 --> 00:23:29.700
press freedom that is if you look at
 

00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:32.659
press freedom that is if you look at
Cambodia Lithuania these are falling

00:23:32.659 --> 00:23:32.669
Cambodia Lithuania these are falling
 

00:23:32.669 --> 00:23:35.060
Cambodia Lithuania these are falling
down at the top and the bottom there's a

00:23:35.060 --> 00:23:35.070
down at the top and the bottom there's a
 

00:23:35.070 --> 00:23:37.009
down at the top and the bottom there's a
discrepancy they're falling off the axis

00:23:37.009 --> 00:23:37.019
discrepancy they're falling off the axis
 

00:23:37.019 --> 00:23:39.739
discrepancy they're falling off the axis
and so the public is disagreeing with

00:23:39.739 --> 00:23:39.749
and so the public is disagreeing with
 

00:23:39.749 --> 00:23:44.499
and so the public is disagreeing with
the elites in those cases now we

00:23:44.499 --> 00:23:44.509
the elites in those cases now we
 

00:23:44.509 --> 00:23:47.570
the elites in those cases now we
conclude lymon airily that this is

00:23:47.570 --> 00:23:47.580
conclude lymon airily that this is
 

00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:49.849
conclude lymon airily that this is
further evidence that there's a link

00:23:49.849 --> 00:23:49.859
further evidence that there's a link
 

00:23:49.859 --> 00:23:51.950
further evidence that there's a link
between elite evaluations of the media

00:23:51.950 --> 00:23:51.960
between elite evaluations of the media
 

00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:53.629
between elite evaluations of the media
and public assessments so there's some

00:23:53.629 --> 00:23:53.639
and public assessments so there's some
 

00:23:53.639 --> 00:23:56.810
and public assessments so there's some
evidence of superiority of the Freedom

00:23:56.810 --> 00:23:56.820
evidence of superiority of the Freedom
 

00:23:56.820 --> 00:23:59.930

that but she's heard that before in fact
 

00:24:04.259 --> 00:24:05.570
that but she's heard that before in fact
that maybe we haven't sent you this

00:24:05.570 --> 00:24:05.580
that maybe we haven't sent you this
 

00:24:05.580 --> 00:24:07.750
that maybe we haven't sent you this

00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:11.410
paper yet
but at any rate the differences in isn't

00:24:11.410 --> 00:24:11.420
but at any rate the differences in isn't
 

00:24:11.420 --> 00:24:13.570
but at any rate the differences in isn't
great but you know it's in the right

00:24:13.570 --> 00:24:13.580
great but you know it's in the right
 

00:24:13.580 --> 00:24:16.900
great but you know it's in the right
direction and there are still some

direction and there are still some
 

00:24:16.910 --> 00:24:19.000

and so when fear of political expression

00:28:28.380 --> 00:28:28.390
and so when fear of political expression
 

00:28:28.390 --> 00:28:30.930
and so when fear of political expression
is very low such as you can see here in

00:28:30.930 --> 00:28:30.940

you essence in that cluster there's
 

00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:38.790
you essence in that cluster there's
actually a negative relationship between

actually a negative relationship between
 

00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:44.290
actually a negative relationship between

press freedom and confidence okay when
 

00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:46.480
press freedom and confidence okay when
again the positive is a negative because

00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:46.490
again the positive is a negative because
 

00:28:46.490 --> 00:28:50.200
again the positive is a negative because

numbers indicate less freedom and the

00:37:04.339 --> 00:37:04.349
numbers indicate less freedom and the
 

00:37:04.349 --> 00:37:06.289
numbers indicate less freedom and the
closer you get to zero the better the

00:37:06.289 --> 00:37:06.299
closer you get to zero the better the
 

00:37:06.299 --> 00:37:07.609

23 methodology questions we divide them

00:37:12.859 --> 00:37:12.869
23 methodology questions we divide them
 

00:37:12.869 --> 00:37:15.380
23 methodology questions we divide them
into these three categories as you can

00:37:15.380 --> 00:37:15.390
into these three categories as you can
 

00:37:15.390 --> 00:37:17.450
into these three categories as you can
see the the categories are pretty evenly

00:37:17.450 --> 00:37:17.460
see the the categories are pretty evenly
 

00:37:17.460 --> 00:37:19.339

we have we have sub I guess totals for
each of these three categories so

00:37:29.590 --> 00:37:29.600
each of these three categories so
 

00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:31.600
each of these three categories so
scholars can look at our overall

working on their draft we have we then
 

00:38:56.290 --> 00:38:58.350
working on their draft we have we then
in March hold review meetings for each

00:38:58.350 --> 00:38:58.360
in March hold review meetings for each
 

00:38:58.360 --> 00:39:00.840
in March hold review meetings for each
region where we gather all the analysts

00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:00.850
region where we gather all the analysts
 

00:39:00.850 --> 00:39:03.030

and our regional advisors together and
 

00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:04.830
and our regional advisors together and
we talked about the scores and go

00:39:04.830 --> 00:39:04.840
we talked about the scores and go
 

00:39:04.840 --> 00:39:06.930
we talked about the scores and go
through all the scoring and then we

00:39:06.930 --> 00:39:06.940
through all the scoring and then we
 

00:39:06.940 --> 00:39:09.390

00:51:41.390 --> 00:51:41.400
time 20 years in my life is short let's
 

00:51:41.400 --> 00:51:43.520
time 20 years in my life is short let's
think about where we were 20 or 30 years

00:51:43.520 --> 00:51:43.530
think about where we were 20 or 30 years
 

00:51:43.530 --> 00:51:46.220
think about where we were 20 or 30 years
ago it was really very much the

00:51:46.220 --> 00:51:46.230
ago it was really very much the
 

00:51:46.230 --> 00:51:48.860
ago it was really very much the
atmosphere of the Cold War and we had

00:51:48.860 --> 00:51:48.870
atmosphere of the Cold War and we had
 

00:51:48.870 --> 00:51:53.840
atmosphere of the Cold War and we had
really a sense that the West was free

00:51:53.840 --> 00:51:53.850
really a sense that the West was free
 

00:51:53.850 --> 00:51:56.990
really a sense that the West was free
the East was not and the rest of the

00:51:56.990 --> 00:51:57.000
the East was not and the rest of the
 

00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:00.550
the East was not and the rest of the
world didn't entirely exist and so

00:52:00.550 --> 00:52:00.560
world didn't entirely exist and so
 

00:52:00.560 --> 00:52:04.910
world didn't entirely exist and so
working with that premise was very very

00:52:04.910 --> 00:52:04.920
working with that premise was very very
 

00:52:04.920 --> 00:52:07.340
working with that premise was very very
challenging and at the Committee to

00:52:07.340 --> 00:52:07.350
challenging and at the Committee to
 

00:52:07.350 --> 00:52:10.280
challenging and at the Committee to
Protect Journalists we were very much a

00:52:10.280 --> 00:52:10.290
Protect Journalists we were very much a
 

00:52:10.290 --> 00:52:12.140
Protect Journalists we were very much a
kind of ambulance service for

00:52:12.140 --> 00:52:12.150
kind of ambulance service for
 

00:52:12.150 --> 00:52:14.420
kind of ambulance service for
journalists we would get reports that a

00:52:14.420 --> 00:52:14.430
journalists we would get reports that a
 

00:52:14.430 --> 00:52:16.430
journalists we would get reports that a
journalist was imprisoned tortured

00:52:16.430 --> 00:52:16.440
journalist was imprisoned tortured
 

00:52:16.440 --> 00:52:19.490
journalist was imprisoned tortured
killed in a given country and our job

00:52:19.490 --> 00:52:19.500
killed in a given country and our job
 

00:52:19.500 --> 00:52:21.500
killed in a given country and our job
was to try to help them physically as

00:52:21.500 --> 00:52:21.510
was to try to help them physically as
 

00:52:21.510 --> 00:52:23.780
was to try to help them physically as
quickly as possible and so that was

00:52:23.780 --> 00:52:23.790
quickly as possible and so that was
 

00:52:23.790 --> 00:52:27.410
quickly as possible and so that was
really how we began as we went along we

00:52:27.410 --> 00:52:27.420
really how we began as we went along we
 

00:52:27.420 --> 00:52:30.500
really how we began as we went along we
found that somewhat to our surprise that

00:52:30.500 --> 00:52:30.510
found that somewhat to our surprise that
 

00:52:30.510 --> 00:52:33.530
found that somewhat to our surprise that
we were gathering data and we would have

00:52:33.530 --> 00:52:33.540
we were gathering data and we would have
 

00:52:33.540 --> 00:52:37.010
we were gathering data and we would have
lists of the actions we had taken and we

00:52:37.010 --> 00:52:37.020
lists of the actions we had taken and we
 

00:52:37.020 --> 00:52:38.720
lists of the actions we had taken and we
would categorize it with our primitive

00:52:38.720 --> 00:52:38.730
would categorize it with our primitive
 

00:52:38.730 --> 00:52:42.380
would categorize it with our primitive
computer systems of the mid-1980s and

00:52:42.380 --> 00:52:42.390
computer systems of the mid-1980s and
 

00:52:42.390 --> 00:52:45.170
computer systems of the mid-1980s and
say well this data might have some kind

00:52:45.170 --> 00:52:45.180
say well this data might have some kind
 

00:52:45.180 --> 00:52:48.440
say well this data might have some kind
of value and we started getting more and

00:52:48.440 --> 00:52:48.450
of value and we started getting more and
 

00:52:48.450 --> 00:52:51.220
of value and we started getting more and
more inquiries from academics and press

00:52:51.220 --> 00:52:51.230
more inquiries from academics and press
 

00:52:51.230 --> 00:52:53.540
more inquiries from academics and press
representatives saying well what does

00:52:53.540 --> 00:52:53.550
representatives saying well what does
 

00:52:53.550 --> 00:52:55.880
representatives saying well what does
your data mean so so we really were

00:52:55.880 --> 00:52:55.890
your data mean so so we really were
 

00:52:55.890 --> 00:52:58.250
your data mean so so we really were
repressed by the audience for our

00:52:58.250 --> 00:52:58.260
repressed by the audience for our
 

00:52:58.260 --> 00:53:01.880
repressed by the audience for our
information to codify it and interpret

00:53:01.880 --> 00:53:01.890
information to codify it and interpret
 

00:53:01.890 --> 00:53:02.460
information to codify it and interpret
it

00:53:02.460 --> 00:53:02.470
it
 

00:53:02.470 --> 00:53:05.490
it
now this caused some problems because

00:53:05.490 --> 00:53:05.500
now this caused some problems because
 

00:53:05.500 --> 00:53:07.800
now this caused some problems because
people would say let's look at your

00:53:07.800 --> 00:53:07.810
people would say let's look at your
 

00:53:07.810 --> 00:53:10.410
people would say let's look at your
computer printout and eight journalists

00:53:10.410 --> 00:53:10.420
computer printout and eight journalists
 

00:53:10.420 --> 00:53:13.050
computer printout and eight journalists
were killed in the Philippines but 20

so which is freer the Philippines or
 

00:53:17.260 --> 00:53:20.040
so which is freer the Philippines or
hungry and we'd say well how many people

00:53:20.040 --> 00:53:20.050
hungry and we'd say well how many people
 

00:53:20.050 --> 00:53:22.190
hungry and we'd say well how many people
in prison equal how many people killed

00:53:22.190 --> 00:53:22.200
in prison equal how many people killed
 

00:53:22.200 --> 00:53:26.670
in prison equal how many people killed
we can't make any sense of that that

00:53:26.670 --> 00:53:26.680
we can't make any sense of that that
 

00:53:26.680 --> 00:53:31.470
we can't make any sense of that that
that equation right and a lot of the

00:53:31.470 --> 00:53:31.480
that equation right and a lot of the
 

00:53:31.480 --> 00:53:34.470
that equation right and a lot of the
press the abuses of press freedom that

00:53:34.470 --> 00:53:34.480
press the abuses of press freedom that
 

00:53:34.480 --> 00:53:37.310
press the abuses of press freedom that
we found were in other categories

00:53:37.310 --> 00:53:37.320
we found were in other categories
 

00:53:37.320 --> 00:53:40.680
we found were in other categories
newspapers confiscated in Singapore all

00:53:40.680 --> 00:53:40.690
newspapers confiscated in Singapore all
 

00:53:40.690 --> 00:53:45.150
newspapers confiscated in Singapore all
right nuisance libel suits right so

00:53:45.150 --> 00:53:45.160
right nuisance libel suits right so
 

00:53:45.160 --> 00:53:46.859
right nuisance libel suits right so
these were things that would chill press

00:53:46.859 --> 00:53:46.869
these were things that would chill press
 

00:53:46.869 --> 00:53:48.900
these were things that would chill press

01:01:29.450 --> 01:01:29.460
press freedom organizations so as you
 

01:01:29.460 --> 01:01:32.570

01:01:32.580 --> 01:01:35.750
see it really may start out sounding
simple but very quickly it became not

01:01:35.750 --> 01:01:35.760
simple but very quickly it became not
 

01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:38.690
simple but very quickly it became not
simple another issue that we continue to

01:01:38.690 --> 01:01:38.700
simple another issue that we continue to
 

01:01:38.700 --> 01:01:41.980
simple another issue that we continue to
struggle with is access to participation

01:01:41.980 --> 01:01:41.990
struggle with is access to participation
 

01:01:41.990 --> 01:01:45.730

01:03:01.260 --> 01:03:02.740
order to be honest in evaluating it you
have to admit that these gray areas

01:03:02.740 --> 01:03:02.750
have to admit that these gray areas
 

01:03:02.750 --> 01:03:09.680
have to admit that these gray areas
exist so one thing that

01:03:09.680 --> 01:03:09.690

these maps they don't create media they
 

01:04:46.050 --> 01:04:47.990
these maps they don't create media they
don't consume media and so therefore

01:04:47.990 --> 01:04:48.000
don't consume media and so therefore
 

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:51.020
don't consume media and so therefore
their their freedom is not fully

01:04:56.020 --> 01:04:59.850
 
it's a lot easier to measure media in

it's a lot easier to measure media in

radio and sometimes I think that we get

01:05:09.070 --> 01:05:10.380

something of a distorted view of

something of a distorted view of
 

01:05:10.390 --> 01:05:13.230
something of a distorted view of

there recording it I don't even think

there recording it I don't even think
 

01:05:25.390 --> 01:05:27.960
there recording it I don't even think
it's probably possible to record it in

01:05:27.960 --> 01:05:27.970
it's probably possible to record it in
 

01:05:27.970 --> 01:05:31.650
it's probably possible to record it in
any meaningful way so if we look at the

01:05:31.650 --> 01:05:31.660
any meaningful way so if we look at the
 

01:05:31.660 --> 01:05:33.810
any meaningful way so if we look at the
world of China as defined by the

01:05:33.810 --> 01:05:33.820
world of China as defined by the
 

01:05:33.820 --> 01:05:36.270

01:05:36.280 --> 01:05:38.610
People's Daily it looks like one picture
if you look at the talk radio

01:05:38.610 --> 01:05:38.620
if you look at the talk radio
 

01:05:38.620 --> 01:05:40.950
if you look at the talk radio
environment of southern China it looks

01:05:40.950 --> 01:05:40.960
environment of southern China it looks
 

01:05:40.960 --> 01:05:44.370
environment of southern China it looks
different and as I said it's not

01:05:44.370 --> 01:05:44.380
different and as I said it's not
 

01:05:44.380 --> 01:05:48.230
different and as I said it's not
necessarily a flaw of the metrics it's

01:05:48.230 --> 01:05:48.240
necessarily a flaw of the metrics it's
 

01:05:48.240 --> 01:05:50.250
necessarily a flaw of the metrics it's
but but I think it's important to

01:05:50.250 --> 01:05:50.260
but but I think it's important to
 

01:05:50.260 --> 01:05:52.230
but but I think it's important to
acknowledge what we're looking at and of

01:05:52.230 --> 01:05:52.240
acknowledge what we're looking at and of
 

01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:55.200

moving forward I think that we're going

moving forward I think that we're going
 

01:06:13.990 --> 01:06:16.320
moving forward I think that we're going
to be increasingly challenged to define

on a press freedom indicator would it

I think it's something that we're

01:11:29.169 --> 01:11:29.179
can compare and contrast this with CBJ
 

01:11:29.179 --> 01:11:33.500
can compare and contrast this with CBJ
how have you handled this this new

01:11:33.500 --> 01:11:33.510
how have you handled this this new
 

01:11:33.510 --> 01:11:35.419
how have you handled this this new
designation this new responsibilities

01:11:35.419 --> 01:11:35.429
designation this new responsibilities
 

01:11:35.429 --> 01:11:37.160
designation this new responsibilities
you mentioned the delegations that you

01:11:37.160 --> 01:11:37.170
you mentioned the delegations that you
 

01:11:37.170 --> 01:11:39.740
you mentioned the delegations that you
get in and now you have to manage I get

01:11:39.740 --> 01:11:39.750
get in and now you have to manage I get
 

01:11:39.750 --> 01:11:41.570
get in and now you have to manage I get
some diplomatic duties how has that

01:11:41.570 --> 01:11:41.580
some diplomatic duties how has that
 

01:11:41.580 --> 01:11:46.790
some diplomatic duties how has that
changed you as an organization I think

01:11:46.790 --> 01:11:46.800
changed you as an organization I think
 

01:11:46.800 --> 01:11:49.340
changed you as an organization I think
one of the main things it's done over

01:11:49.340 --> 01:11:49.350
one of the main things it's done over
 

01:11:49.350 --> 01:11:51.320
one of the main things it's done over
the past five or six years I would say

01:11:51.320 --> 01:11:51.330
the past five or six years I would say
 

01:11:51.330 --> 01:11:52.610
the past five or six years I would say
is we and it's been very difficult

01:11:52.610 --> 01:11:52.620
is we and it's been very difficult
 

01:11:52.620 --> 01:11:55.129
is we and it's been very difficult
because of funding constraints and

01:11:55.129 --> 01:11:55.139
because of funding constraints and
 

01:11:55.139 --> 01:11:56.660
because of funding constraints and
personnel constraints and things like

01:11:56.660 --> 01:11:56.670
personnel constraints and things like
 

01:11:56.670 --> 01:11:58.610
personnel constraints and things like
that but we've really tried to increase

01:11:58.610 --> 01:11:58.620
that but we've really tried to increase
 

01:11:58.620 --> 01:12:01.399
that but we've really tried to increase
the analytical rigor of our work both of

01:12:01.399 --> 01:12:01.409
the analytical rigor of our work both of
 

01:12:01.409 --> 01:12:03.450
the analytical rigor of our work both of
our main surveys

01:12:03.450 --> 01:12:03.460
our main surveys
 

01:12:03.460 --> 01:12:06.060
our main surveys
so that's led to several things I would

01:12:06.060 --> 01:12:06.070
so that's led to several things I would
 

01:12:06.070 --> 01:12:08.790
so that's led to several things I would
say a much more detailed editing process

01:12:08.790 --> 01:12:08.800
say a much more detailed editing process
 

01:12:08.800 --> 01:12:11.370
say a much more detailed editing process
sort of cross checking things like that

01:12:11.370 --> 01:12:11.380
sort of cross checking things like that
 

01:12:11.380 --> 01:12:13.020
sort of cross checking things like that
we've increased the teams of analysts

01:12:13.020 --> 01:12:13.030
we've increased the teams of analysts
 

01:12:13.030 --> 01:12:16.590
we've increased the teams of analysts
for both publications some analysts for

01:12:16.590 --> 01:12:16.600
for both publications some analysts for
 

01:12:16.600 --> 01:12:18.270
for both publications some analysts for
example used to let maybe write ten

01:12:18.270 --> 01:12:18.280
example used to let maybe write ten
 

01:12:18.280 --> 01:12:19.680
example used to let maybe write ten
countries now it would be more like

01:12:19.680 --> 01:12:19.690
countries now it would be more like
 

01:12:19.690 --> 01:12:21.750
countries now it would be more like
three to five so we have people really

01:12:21.750 --> 01:12:21.760
three to five so we have people really
 

01:12:21.760 --> 01:12:24.720
three to five so we have people really
honing in on reports the narrative

01:12:24.720 --> 01:12:24.730
honing in on reports the narrative
 

01:12:24.730 --> 01:12:26.910
honing in on reports the narrative
reports are longer for both publications

01:12:26.910 --> 01:12:26.920
reports are longer for both publications
 

01:12:26.920 --> 01:12:28.560
reports are longer for both publications
as well so they're more detailed they

01:12:28.560 --> 01:12:28.570
as well so they're more detailed they
 

01:12:28.570 --> 01:12:31.650
as well so they're more detailed they
provide more nuanced analysis in terms

01:12:31.650 --> 01:12:31.660
provide more nuanced analysis in terms
 

01:12:31.660 --> 01:12:34.920
provide more nuanced analysis in terms
of the the narrative portion I notice a

01:12:34.920 --> 01:12:34.930
of the the narrative portion I notice a
 

01:12:34.930 --> 01:12:36.600
of the the narrative portion I notice a
lot of the press freedom report sizes

01:12:36.600 --> 01:12:36.610
lot of the press freedom report sizes
 

01:12:36.610 --> 01:12:38.250
lot of the press freedom report sizes
have probably doubled or tripled over

01:12:38.250 --> 01:12:38.260
have probably doubled or tripled over
 

01:12:38.260 --> 01:12:40.620
have probably doubled or tripled over
the last five or six years and we've

01:12:40.620 --> 01:12:40.630
the last five or six years and we've
 

01:12:40.630 --> 01:12:42.810
the last five or six years and we've
also tried to increase the numbers

01:12:42.810 --> 01:12:42.820
also tried to increase the numbers
 

01:12:42.820 --> 01:12:44.490
also tried to increase the numbers
increase the length of our ratings

01:12:44.490 --> 01:12:44.500
increase the length of our ratings
 

01:12:44.500 --> 01:12:45.690
increase the length of our ratings
meetings and the number of people

01:12:45.690 --> 01:12:45.700
meetings and the number of people
 

01:12:45.700 --> 01:12:47.520
meetings and the number of people
involved in the in the process in terms

01:12:47.520 --> 01:12:47.530
involved in the in the process in terms
 

01:12:47.530 --> 01:12:50.490
involved in the in the process in terms
of the review process so I've also tried

01:12:50.490 --> 01:12:50.500
of the review process so I've also tried
 

01:12:50.500 --> 01:12:53.130
of the review process so I've also tried
to for example bring in local voices by

01:12:53.130 --> 01:12:53.140
to for example bring in local voices by
 

01:12:53.140 --> 01:12:55.229
to for example bring in local voices by
sending out draft reports to local press

01:12:55.229 --> 01:12:55.239
sending out draft reports to local press
 

01:12:55.239 --> 01:12:57.000
sending out draft reports to local press
freedom organizations as well as much as

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:57.010
freedom organizations as well as much as
 

01:12:57.010 --> 01:12:59.580
freedom organizations as well as much as
I can so I think I think that's one of

01:12:59.580 --> 01:12:59.590
I can so I think I think that's one of
 

01:12:59.590 --> 01:13:00.810
I can so I think I think that's one of
the main things we've tried to do is

01:13:00.810 --> 01:13:00.820
the main things we've tried to do is
 

01:13:00.820 --> 01:13:03.330
the main things we've tried to do is
really improve the the analytical rigor

01:13:03.330 --> 01:13:03.340
really improve the the analytical rigor
 

01:13:03.340 --> 01:13:05.220
really improve the the analytical rigor
and the and the detail that we're able

01:13:05.220 --> 01:13:05.230
and the and the detail that we're able
 

01:13:05.230 --> 01:13:08.310
and the and the detail that we're able
to provide as well so we it sort of put

01:13:08.310 --> 01:13:08.320
to provide as well so we it sort of put
 

01:13:08.320 --> 01:13:10.200
to provide as well so we it sort of put
on us on our toes in terms of trying to

01:13:10.200 --> 01:13:10.210
on us on our toes in terms of trying to
 

01:13:10.210 --> 01:13:11.459
on us on our toes in terms of trying to
improve what we're doing because we

01:13:11.459 --> 01:13:11.469
improve what we're doing because we
 

01:13:11.469 --> 01:13:13.920
improve what we're doing because we
realized that these these scores are

01:13:13.920 --> 01:13:13.930
realized that these these scores are
 

01:13:13.930 --> 01:13:16.290
realized that these these scores are
being used to make very big decisions

01:13:16.290 --> 01:13:16.300
being used to make very big decisions
 

01:13:16.300 --> 01:13:17.910
being used to make very big decisions
about large amounts of money so it's not

01:13:17.910 --> 01:13:17.920
about large amounts of money so it's not
 

01:13:17.920 --> 01:13:21.150
about large amounts of money so it's not
just a very theoretical idea of like oh

01:13:21.150 --> 01:13:21.160
just a very theoretical idea of like oh
 

01:13:21.160 --> 01:13:22.410
just a very theoretical idea of like oh
well this country is getting the score

01:13:22.410 --> 01:13:22.420
well this country is getting the score
 

01:13:22.420 --> 01:13:23.640
well this country is getting the score
and that's that's cool you know it

01:13:23.640 --> 01:13:23.650
and that's that's cool you know it
 

01:13:23.650 --> 01:13:25.140
and that's that's cool you know it
really is having a big impact and we're

01:13:25.140 --> 01:13:25.150
really is having a big impact and we're
 

01:13:25.150 --> 01:13:27.000
really is having a big impact and we're
trying to sort of make sure that we are

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:27.010
trying to sort of make sure that we are
 

01:13:27.010 --> 01:13:28.470
trying to sort of make sure that we are
able to step up to the plate and defend

01:13:28.470 --> 01:13:28.480
able to step up to the plate and defend
 

01:13:28.480 --> 01:13:30.810
able to step up to the plate and defend
our rating so a government comes and

01:13:30.810 --> 01:13:30.820
our rating so a government comes and
 

01:13:30.820 --> 01:13:32.610
our rating so a government comes and
asks us a question we're able to really

01:13:32.610 --> 01:13:32.620
asks us a question we're able to really
 

01:13:32.620 --> 01:13:34.170
asks us a question we're able to really
have all the evidence there and make

01:13:34.170 --> 01:13:34.180
have all the evidence there and make
 

01:13:34.180 --> 01:13:35.620
have all the evidence there and make
sure we can defend it

01:13:35.620 --> 01:13:35.630
sure we can defend it
 

01:13:35.630 --> 01:13:38.770
sure we can defend it
yeah thank you and did you well

01:13:38.770 --> 01:13:38.780
yeah thank you and did you well
 

01:13:38.780 --> 01:13:43.419
yeah thank you and did you well
certainly the research firepower of this

01:13:43.419 --> 01:13:43.429
certainly the research firepower of this
 

01:13:43.429 --> 01:13:47.229
certainly the research firepower of this
field has stepped up to an unimaginable

01:13:47.229 --> 01:13:47.239
field has stepped up to an unimaginable
 

01:13:47.239 --> 01:13:52.240
field has stepped up to an unimaginable
level when i started at CPJ in 1988 we

01:13:52.240 --> 01:13:52.250
level when i started at CPJ in 1988 we
 

01:13:52.250 --> 01:13:54.610
level when i started at CPJ in 1988 we
were three and a half people when I left

01:13:54.610 --> 01:13:54.620
were three and a half people when I left
 

01:13:54.620 --> 01:13:58.180
were three and a half people when I left
in 92 we were 12 and now i believe it's

01:13:58.180 --> 01:13:58.190
in 92 we were 12 and now i believe it's
 

01:13:58.190 --> 01:14:01.090
in 92 we were 12 and now i believe it's
22 with with additional offices

01:14:01.090 --> 01:14:01.100
22 with with additional offices
 

01:14:01.100 --> 01:14:03.610
22 with with additional offices
elsewhere so just just the sheer

01:14:03.610 --> 01:14:03.620
elsewhere so just just the sheer
 

01:14:03.620 --> 01:14:06.669
elsewhere so just just the sheer
research capacity is phenomenal and the

01:14:06.669 --> 01:14:06.679
research capacity is phenomenal and the
 

01:14:06.679 --> 01:14:10.570
research capacity is phenomenal and the
other thing is that you build on on your

01:14:10.570 --> 01:14:10.580
other thing is that you build on on your
 

01:14:10.580 --> 01:14:12.760
other thing is that you build on on your
learning I mean we are we have all been

01:14:12.760 --> 01:14:12.770
learning I mean we are we have all been
 

01:14:12.770 --> 01:14:15.100
learning I mean we are we have all been
part of a chapter of history that's been

01:14:15.100 --> 01:14:15.110
part of a chapter of history that's been
 

01:14:15.110 --> 01:14:16.780
part of a chapter of history that's been
about creation of a body of knowledge

01:14:16.780 --> 01:14:16.790
about creation of a body of knowledge
 

01:14:16.790 --> 01:14:19.510
about creation of a body of knowledge
and interacting with each other in

01:14:19.510 --> 01:14:19.520
and interacting with each other in
 

01:14:19.520 --> 01:14:21.790
and interacting with each other in
international meetings and learning from

01:14:21.790 --> 01:14:21.800
international meetings and learning from
 

01:14:21.800 --> 01:14:24.790
international meetings and learning from
each other so so I think that when we go

01:14:24.790 --> 01:14:24.800
each other so so I think that when we go
 

01:14:24.800 --> 01:14:27.729
each other so so I think that when we go
I haven't been face-to-face with an

01:14:27.729 --> 01:14:27.739
I haven't been face-to-face with an
 

01:14:27.739 --> 01:14:29.590
I haven't been face-to-face with an
angry government minister now for a few

01:14:29.590 --> 01:14:29.600
angry government minister now for a few
 

01:14:29.600 --> 01:14:34.750
angry government minister now for a few
years it's lots of fun and usually I

01:14:34.750 --> 01:14:34.760
years it's lots of fun and usually I
 

01:14:34.760 --> 01:14:37.419
years it's lots of fun and usually I
find that I would find that they were

01:14:37.419 --> 01:14:37.429
find that I would find that they were
 

01:14:37.429 --> 01:14:40.629
find that I would find that they were
fairly poorly prepared and that you

01:14:40.629 --> 01:14:40.639
fairly poorly prepared and that you
 

01:14:40.639 --> 01:14:43.270
fairly poorly prepared and that you
could counter their protests with a few

01:14:43.270 --> 01:14:43.280
could counter their protests with a few
 

01:14:43.280 --> 01:14:46.060
could counter their protests with a few
facts and they wouldn't have much to

01:14:46.060 --> 01:14:46.070
facts and they wouldn't have much to
 

01:14:46.070 --> 01:14:49.300
facts and they wouldn't have much to
respond and in fact sometimes you felt

01:14:49.300 --> 01:14:49.310
respond and in fact sometimes you felt
 

01:14:49.310 --> 01:14:50.410
respond and in fact sometimes you felt
like you were informing them about

01:14:50.410 --> 01:14:50.420
like you were informing them about
 

01:14:50.420 --> 01:14:52.660
like you were informing them about
problems of their country that they may

01:14:52.660 --> 01:14:52.670
problems of their country that they may
 

01:14:52.670 --> 01:14:56.050
problems of their country that they may
not have been aware of so there's almost

01:14:56.050 --> 01:14:56.060
not have been aware of so there's almost
 

01:14:56.060 --> 01:14:59.379
not have been aware of so there's almost
an educational element in it as well and

01:14:59.379 --> 01:14:59.389
an educational element in it as well and
 

01:14:59.389 --> 01:15:01.120
an educational element in it as well and
sometimes I think privately you get the

01:15:01.120 --> 01:15:01.130
sometimes I think privately you get the
 

01:15:01.130 --> 01:15:03.490
sometimes I think privately you get the
sense that they almost welcome learning

01:15:03.490 --> 01:15:03.500
sense that they almost welcome learning
 

01:15:03.500 --> 01:15:07.520
sense that they almost welcome learning
about this org agree with you yeah

01:15:07.520 --> 01:15:07.530
about this org agree with you yeah
 

01:15:07.530 --> 01:15:09.200
about this org agree with you yeah
no they were just being sent there by

01:15:09.200 --> 01:15:09.210
no they were just being sent there by
 

01:15:09.210 --> 01:15:11.900

they suggest that we really don't know
 

01:20:40.090 --> 01:20:43.370
they suggest that we really don't know
very much about what the consequences of

01:20:50.540 --> 01:20:50.550
we have as I indicated my presentation
 

01:20:50.550 --> 01:20:54.010
we have as I indicated my presentation
we have looked at the relationship of

01:20:54.010 --> 01:20:54.020
we have looked at the relationship of
 

01:20:54.020 --> 01:20:56.750
we have looked at the relationship of
competition and performance and it

01:20:56.750 --> 01:20:56.760
competition and performance and it
 

01:20:56.760 --> 01:20:59.240
competition and performance and it
appears consistent with so that I think

01:20:59.240 --> 01:20:59.250
appears consistent with so that I think
 

01:20:59.250 --> 01:21:01.010
appears consistent with so that I think
the presumption of your question is that

Pittman Norris has been looking at some
 

01:21:28.770 --> 01:21:30.320
Pittman Norris has been looking at some
of the knowledge questions and I don't

01:21:30.320 --> 01:21:30.330
of the knowledge questions and I don't
 

01:21:30.330 --> 01:21:33.020
of the knowledge questions and I don't
think they're particularly encouraging

01:21:33.020 --> 01:21:33.030
think they're particularly encouraging

if the difficulty is is that you need

if the difficulty is is that you need

comparable measures to take that example

you need comparable measures of

the analysis so you know I think if we

the analysis so you know I think if we
 

01:21:48.900 --> 01:21:52.400
the analysis so you know I think if we
look at at our own situation as we've

we've had radically different political
outcome I mean we've had we have

think it's produced higher level

so that would simply be one case which

01:22:30.100 --> 01:22:30.110
so that would simply be one case which
 

01:22:30.110 --> 01:22:31.870
so that would simply be one case which
would suggest that a higher level of

01:22:31.870 --> 01:22:31.880
would suggest that a higher level of
 

01:22:31.880 --> 01:22:34.120
would suggest that a higher level of
freedom doesn't necessarily produce the

01:22:38.619 --> 01:22:40.810
 
yeah I definitely would agree with Leon

01:22:40.810 --> 01:22:40.820
yeah I definitely would agree with Leon

wish academics would do and use our data

01:22:49.030 --> 01:22:49.040
wish academics would do and use our data
 

01:22:49.040 --> 01:22:50.500
wish academics would do and use our data
to look at some of these other issues

to look at some of these other issues
 

01:22:50.510 --> 01:22:53.979
to look at some of these other issues
but I'll just make a few comments based

01:22:53.979 --> 01:22:53.989
but I'll just make a few comments based
 

01:22:53.989 --> 01:22:55.629
but I'll just make a few comments based

01:22:59.649 --> 01:22:59.659
increased commercialization and
 

01:22:59.659 --> 01:23:02.080
increased commercialization and
competition can lead to more

and less quality in some ways so I
 

01:23:12.349 --> 01:23:13.689

definitely don't think there's

really looked at the positive side but

on the negative side there does seem to

on the negative side there does seem to

their publishing and so one thing I
wanted to ask you Lee is it seems to me

this in constructing indices is perhaps

01:28:01.110 --> 01:28:01.120
this in constructing indices is perhaps
 

01:28:01.120 --> 01:28:03.070
this in constructing indices is perhaps
to actually make use of these individual

level surveys that you were discussing
 

01:28:05.120 --> 01:28:06.940
level surveys that you were discussing
earlier and so one thing I wanted to ask

01:28:06.940 --> 01:28:06.950
earlier and so one thing I wanted to ask
 

01:28:06.950 --> 01:28:09.220
earlier and so one thing I wanted to ask
you is whether you think such a thing is

01:28:09.220 --> 01:28:09.230
you is whether you think such a thing is
 

01:28:09.230 --> 01:28:11.470
you is whether you think such a thing is
possible but also just because it seems

01:28:11.470 --> 01:28:11.480
possible but also just because it seems
 

01:28:11.480 --> 01:28:14.320
possible but also just because it seems
like we don't and this sort of gets too

01:28:14.320 --> 01:28:14.330
like we don't and this sort of gets too
 

01:28:14.330 --> 01:28:16.440
like we don't and this sort of gets too
I think somewhat to Jack's point as well

01:28:16.440 --> 01:28:16.450
I think somewhat to Jack's point as well
 

01:28:16.450 --> 01:28:18.700
I think somewhat to Jack's point as well
because we don't really understand the

01:28:18.700 --> 01:28:18.710
because we don't really understand the
 

01:28:18.710 --> 01:28:20.920
because we don't really understand the
dynamics of what individuals really

01:28:20.920 --> 01:28:20.930

think about their media and how that

01:28:22.300 --> 01:28:22.310
think about their media and how that

freedoms whether you think such a

01:28:25.780 --> 01:28:25.790
freedoms whether you think such a
 

01:28:25.790 --> 01:28:30.220
freedoms whether you think such a
measure would would even be useful well

01:28:30.220 --> 01:28:30.230
measure would would even be useful well
 

01:28:30.230 --> 01:28:32.800

I mean I do I think that public opinion

01:28:32.800 --> 01:28:32.810
I mean I do I think that public opinion
 

01:28:32.810 --> 01:28:35.350
I mean I do I think that public opinion
component would be a new dimension in a

01:28:35.350 --> 01:28:35.360
component would be a new dimension in a
 

01:28:35.360 --> 01:28:37.690

valuable dimension to what we know about

01:28:37.690 --> 01:28:37.700
valuable dimension to what we know about
 

01:28:37.700 --> 01:28:42.160
valuable dimension to what we know about
media systems in the country so I mean I

01:28:42.160 --> 01:28:42.170
media systems in the country so I mean I
 

01:28:42.170 --> 01:28:44.860
media systems in the country so I mean I
think the evidence so far is that that's

01:28:44.860 --> 01:28:44.870
think the evidence so far is that that's
 

01:28:44.870 --> 01:28:46.870
think the evidence so far is that that's
something that can and should be added

01:28:46.870 --> 01:28:46.880
something that can and should be added
 

01:28:46.880 --> 01:28:48.310
something that can and should be added
in the future when one's trying to

01:28:48.310 --> 01:28:48.320
in the future when one's trying to
 

01:28:48.320 --> 01:28:51.220
in the future when one's trying to
understand a country and it's being a

01:28:51.220 --> 01:28:51.230
understand a country and it's being a
 

01:28:51.230 --> 01:28:53.650

01:28:53.650 --> 01:28:53.660
system so to take the outlying cases
 

01:28:53.660 --> 01:28:56.620
system so to take the outlying cases
that you would have situation where you

01:28:56.620 --> 01:28:56.630
that you would have situation where you

that you would have situation where you
had a Vietnam which is a deviant case

Lithuania is the deviant case these are

01:29:01.390 --> 01:29:01.400
Lithuania is the deviant case these are

think that must tell you something about

the public about what their capabilities
 

01:29:19.100 --> 01:29:21.640
the public about what their capabilities
are where the government is lit misled

01:29:21.640 --> 01:29:21.650
are where the government is lit misled

the public about what their capabilities
are in the other and those are I think

informative deviant cases so you would

01:29:28.780 --> 01:29:28.790
informative deviant cases so you would
 

01:29:28.790 --> 01:29:33.750
informative deviant cases so you would
gain something by having that part of

gain something by having that part of
the analytic structure part of the part

was a little different and that is to

01:29:42.060 --> 01:29:42.070
was a little different and that is to
 

01:29:42.070 --> 01:29:43.680
was a little different and that is to
really raise the question a question of

01:29:43.680 --> 01:29:43.690
really raise the question a question of
 

01:29:43.690 --> 01:29:47.189
really raise the question a question of
what it is we mean by media freedom or

01:29:47.189 --> 01:29:47.199
what it is we mean by media freedom or
 

01:29:47.199 --> 01:29:49.770
what it is we mean by media freedom or
media independence and historically it

01:29:49.770 --> 01:29:49.780
media independence and historically it
 

01:29:49.780 --> 01:29:52.470
media independence and historically it
meant independence from government and

01:29:52.470 --> 01:29:52.480
meant independence from government and
 

01:29:52.480 --> 01:29:56.629
meant independence from government and
the indicators were focused on

01:29:56.629 --> 01:29:56.639
the indicators were focused on
 

01:29:56.639 --> 01:29:59.399
the indicators were focused on
government constraints I think what

01:29:59.399 --> 01:29:59.409
government constraints I think what
 

01:29:59.409 --> 01:30:01.979
government constraints I think what
we're coming to understand is that the

01:30:01.979 --> 01:30:01.989
we're coming to understand is that the
 

01:30:01.989 --> 01:30:03.299
we're coming to understand is that the
government is only part of what

01:30:03.299 --> 01:30:03.309
government is only part of what
 

01:30:03.309 --> 01:30:05.600
government is only part of what
constrains the media environment and

01:30:05.600 --> 01:30:05.610
constrains the media environment and
 

01:30:05.610 --> 01:30:08.549
constrains the media environment and
maybe more important is the economic

01:30:08.549 --> 01:30:08.559
maybe more important is the economic
 

01:30:08.559 --> 01:30:12.990
maybe more important is the economic
environment if you have immediate media

01:30:12.990 --> 01:30:13.000
environment if you have immediate media
 

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:16.680

that are competing in an economic

that so if you really want to understand

01:30:38.580 --> 01:30:38.590
that so if you really want to understand

really want to understand about
 

01:31:08.179 --> 01:31:12.490
really want to understand about
independence and there's also quite a

the focus has been more looking at
 

01:32:02.420 --> 01:32:06.070
the focus has been more looking at
government controls and repression but i

01:32:06.070 --> 01:32:06.080
government controls and repression but i

Freedom House index does look at some of
 

01:32:09.560 --> 01:32:12.280

these other issues when we expanded and
 

01:32:12.290 --> 01:32:14.860
these other issues when we expanded and
deepened our methodology in 2002 which I

01:32:14.860 --> 01:32:14.870
deepened our methodology in 2002 which I
 

01:32:14.870 --> 01:32:16.450
deepened our methodology in 2002 which I
was involved with shortly after coming

in some of these economic issues and at
the moment we do as I said the

01:32:23.290 --> 01:32:23.300
the moment we do as I said the
 

01:32:23.300 --> 01:32:25.570
the moment we do as I said the
categories are weighted somewhat equally

01:32:25.570 --> 01:32:25.580

the main critiques I get of the indexes
 

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:30.430
the main critiques I get of the indexes

that's the economic issues are not
weighted more heavily but we do actually

01:32:32.770 --> 01:32:32.780
weighted more heavily but we do actually
 

01:32:32.780 --> 01:32:34.930
weighted more heavily but we do actually
cover them we do have questions on the

that we should maybe wait them a little
 

01:33:04.679 --> 01:33:06.380

01:34:50.770 --> 01:34:54.380
 
okay thank you well I actually think

01:34:54.380 --> 01:34:54.390
okay thank you well I actually think
 

01:34:54.390 --> 01:34:57.930
okay thank you well I actually think
that we're in a period we're almost

01:34:57.930 --> 01:34:57.940
that we're in a period we're almost
 

01:34:57.940 --> 01:35:01.710
that we're in a period we're almost
everything we think we know about the

01:35:01.710 --> 01:35:01.720
everything we think we know about the
 

01:35:01.720 --> 01:35:05.340
everything we think we know about the

of our theorizing about media
 

01:35:06.970 --> 01:35:10.830
of our theorizing about media
institutions is probably outdated all of

01:35:10.830 --> 01:35:10.840

our understanding about journalistic

01:35:14.070 --> 01:35:14.080
our understanding about journalistic
 

01:35:14.080 --> 01:35:17.760
our understanding about journalistic
routines is probably outdated I think

01:35:17.760 --> 01:35:17.770
routines is probably outdated I think
 

01:35:17.770 --> 01:35:20.780
routines is probably outdated I think
almost all of our literature is if not

01:35:20.780 --> 01:35:20.790
almost all of our literature is if not
 

01:35:20.790 --> 01:35:24.300
almost all of our literature is if not

01:35:24.300 --> 01:35:24.310
it's certainly open to challenge and I
 

01:35:24.310 --> 01:35:26.730
it's certainly open to challenge and I
don't have any answer to that but it

01:35:26.730 --> 01:35:26.740
don't have any answer to that but it
 

01:35:26.740 --> 01:35:29.730
don't have any answer to that but it
seems to me that honestly we have to say

01:35:29.730 --> 01:35:29.740
seems to me that honestly we have to say
 

01:35:29.740 --> 01:35:32.430
seems to me that honestly we have to say
that this is such an incredibly dramatic

01:35:32.430 --> 01:35:32.440
that this is such an incredibly dramatic
 

01:35:32.440 --> 01:35:34.590
that this is such an incredibly dramatic
change in the media landscape that

almost everything we talked about needs

01:35:36.690 --> 01:35:36.700
almost everything we talked about needs
 

01:35:36.700 --> 01:35:40.640
almost everything we talked about needs
to be reassessed reconsidered and

01:35:40.640 --> 01:35:40.650
to be reassessed reconsidered and
 

01:35:40.650 --> 01:35:43.980
to be reassessed reconsidered and
rethought and I think your question kind

01:35:43.980 --> 01:35:43.990
rethought and I think your question kind
 

01:35:43.990 --> 01:35:47.370
rethought and I think your question kind
of suggests that Karen inning yeah just

01:35:47.370 --> 01:35:47.380
of suggests that Karen inning yeah just
 

01:35:47.380 --> 01:35:49.440
of suggests that Karen inning yeah just
to jump in I mean it is a is a time of

01:35:49.440 --> 01:35:49.450
to jump in I mean it is a is a time of
 

01:35:49.450 --> 01:35:50.790
to jump in I mean it is a is a time of
huge change and I think one of the

01:35:50.790 --> 01:35:50.800
huge change and I think one of the
 

01:35:50.800 --> 01:35:52.290
huge change and I think one of the
challenges for us and for the other

01:35:52.290 --> 01:35:52.300
challenges for us and for the other
 

01:35:52.300 --> 01:35:54.450
challenges for us and for the other
groups that produce the indicators is is

01:35:54.450 --> 01:35:54.460
groups that produce the indicators is is
 

01:35:54.460 --> 01:35:58.080
groups that produce the indicators is is
how to change and evolve and update the

01:35:58.080 --> 01:35:58.090
how to change and evolve and update the
 

01:35:58.090 --> 01:35:59.610
how to change and evolve and update the
indicators to take into account these

01:35:59.610 --> 01:35:59.620
indicators to take into account these
 

01:35:59.620 --> 01:36:02.580
indicators to take into account these
changes but also to to keep them enough

01:36:02.580 --> 01:36:02.590
changes but also to to keep them enough
 

01:36:02.590 --> 01:36:04.470
changes but also to to keep them enough
the same so that we do have comparable

01:36:04.470 --> 01:36:04.480
the same so that we do have comparable
 

01:36:04.480 --> 01:36:06.270
the same so that we do have comparable
data sets and this is I think the most

01:36:06.270 --> 01:36:06.280
data sets and this is I think the most
 

01:36:06.280 --> 01:36:07.710
data sets and this is I think the most
an issue for freedom has because we have

01:36:07.710 --> 01:36:07.720
an issue for freedom has because we have
 

01:36:07.720 --> 01:36:09.780
an issue for freedom has because we have
the longest data set but it's an issue

01:36:09.780 --> 01:36:09.790
the longest data set but it's an issue
 

01:36:09.790 --> 01:36:12.420
the longest data set but it's an issue
increasingly for other groups as well we

01:36:12.420 --> 01:36:12.430
increasingly for other groups as well we
 

01:36:12.430 --> 01:36:14.460
increasingly for other groups as well we
have tried over the last few years to to

01:36:14.460 --> 01:36:14.470
have tried over the last few years to to
 

01:36:14.470 --> 01:36:17.130
have tried over the last few years to to
update our list of bulleted guidelines

01:36:17.130 --> 01:36:17.140
update our list of bulleted guidelines
 

01:36:17.140 --> 01:36:19.200
update our list of bulleted guidelines
for for our methodology questions both

01:36:19.200 --> 01:36:19.210
for for our methodology questions both
 

01:36:19.210 --> 01:36:20.610
for for our methodology questions both
to look at the impact of the internet

01:36:20.610 --> 01:36:20.620

news production and consumption is

01:36:27.060 --> 01:36:27.070
news production and consumption is
 

01:36:27.070 --> 01:36:29.400
news production and consumption is
taking place so looking at bloggers

01:36:29.400 --> 01:36:29.410
taking place so looking at bloggers
 

01:36:29.410 --> 01:36:31.110

citizen journalists as opposed to

01:36:31.110 --> 01:36:31.120
citizen journalists as opposed to
 

01:36:31.120 --> 01:36:32.790
citizen journalists as opposed to
professional journalists and all the

01:36:32.790 --> 01:36:32.800
professional journalists and all the
 

01:36:32.800 --> 01:36:33.900
professional journalists and all the
different ways in which people are

01:36:33.900 --> 01:36:33.910
different ways in which people are
 

01:36:33.910 --> 01:36:35.850
different ways in which people are
getting their information now you know

01:36:35.850 --> 01:36:35.860
getting their information now you know
 

01:36:35.860 --> 01:36:37.710
getting their information now you know
by a mobile phone by the internet so

01:36:37.710 --> 01:36:37.720
by a mobile phone by the internet so
 

01:36:37.720 --> 01:36:39.960
by a mobile phone by the internet so
we're really trying to to sort of tweak

01:36:39.960 --> 01:36:39.970
we're really trying to to sort of tweak
 

01:36:39.970 --> 01:36:42.570
we're really trying to to sort of tweak
the the methodology but but keep it

01:36:42.570 --> 01:36:42.580
the the methodology but but keep it
 

01:36:42.580 --> 01:36:43.860
the the methodology but but keep it
within the same framework now I don't

01:36:43.860 --> 01:36:43.870
within the same framework now I don't
 

01:36:43.870 --> 01:36:45.660
within the same framework now I don't
know how much longer we can you can do

01:36:45.660 --> 01:36:45.670
know how much longer we can you can do
 

01:36:45.670 --> 01:36:47.190
know how much longer we can you can do
this for and we are thinking about

01:36:47.190 --> 01:36:47.200
this for and we are thinking about
 

01:36:47.200 --> 01:36:49.590
this for and we are thinking about
trying to you know have a broader more

01:36:49.590 --> 01:36:49.600
trying to you know have a broader more
 

01:36:49.600 --> 01:36:51.560
trying to you know have a broader more
in-depth discussion about our method

01:36:51.560 --> 01:36:51.570
in-depth discussion about our method
 

01:36:51.570 --> 01:36:53.360
in-depth discussion about our method
going forward so we'll we'll see how it

01:36:53.360 --> 01:36:53.370
going forward so we'll we'll see how it
 

01:36:53.370 --> 01:36:54.680
going forward so we'll we'll see how it
goes but I think that is a challenge for

01:36:54.680 --> 01:36:54.690
goes but I think that is a challenge for
 

01:36:54.690 --> 01:36:56.330
goes but I think that is a challenge for
all of us and all of these indicator

01:36:56.330 --> 01:36:56.340
all of us and all of these indicator
 

01:36:56.340 --> 01:36:58.490
all of us and all of these indicator
projects I'm particularly I think in the

01:36:58.490 --> 01:36:58.500
projects I'm particularly I think in the
 

01:36:58.500 --> 01:37:00.740
projects I'm particularly I think in the
media sphere more than let's say I with

01:37:00.740 --> 01:37:00.750
media sphere more than let's say I with
 

01:37:00.750 --> 01:37:02.300

the democracies fear more generally just
 

01:37:02.310 --> 01:37:03.680
the democracies fear more generally just
because it is such a changing

01:37:03.680 --> 01:37:03.690
because it is such a changing
 

01:37:03.690 --> 01:37:07.730
because it is such a changing
environment and very very fast I spent a

01:37:07.730 --> 01:37:07.740
environment and very very fast I spent a
 

01:37:07.740 --> 01:37:09.590
environment and very very fast I spent a
lot of time writing about the

01:37:09.590 --> 01:37:09.600
lot of time writing about the
 

01:37:09.600 --> 01:37:11.570
lot of time writing about the

they're both really important I I spend
a lot of time kind of defending the need

01:37:21.140 --> 01:37:21.150
a lot of time kind of defending the need
 

01:37:21.150 --> 01:37:23.540
