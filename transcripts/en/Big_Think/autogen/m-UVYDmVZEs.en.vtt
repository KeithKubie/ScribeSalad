00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:09.600
 
 

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.940
 
Jack you have the question how do we

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:11.950
Jack you have the question how do we
 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:14.430
Jack you have the question how do we
remove gravity from the anti-gravity

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:14.440
remove gravity from the anti-gravity
 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.109
remove gravity from the anti-gravity
chambers that astronauts trained in and

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:16.119
chambers that astronauts trained in and
 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:18.630
chambers that astronauts trained in and
you've probably seen films of astronauts

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:18.640
you've probably seen films of astronauts
 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.670
you've probably seen films of astronauts
and training floating around in a closed

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:20.680
and training floating around in a closed
 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.589
and training floating around in a closed
chamber and it does kind of look like we

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:22.599
chamber and it does kind of look like we
 

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:23.550
chamber and it does kind of look like we
may have something that can actually

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:23.560
may have something that can actually
 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.429
may have something that can actually
shield against gravity well for one

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:26.439
shield against gravity well for one
 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:28.470
shield against gravity well for one
thing I I really wish we did because I

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:28.480
thing I I really wish we did because I
 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:29.849
thing I I really wish we did because I
mean just think about how useful that

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:29.859
mean just think about how useful that
 

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:31.320
mean just think about how useful that
would be think about having say a

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:31.330
would be think about having say a
 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:33.390
would be think about having say a
construction yellow site and you can

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:33.400
construction yellow site and you can
 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.190
construction yellow site and you can
remove all of the gravity you could

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:35.200
remove all of the gravity you could
 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.510
remove all of the gravity you could
actually move things around really

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:36.520
actually move things around really
 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.790
actually move things around really
easily there's so many applications for

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:38.800
easily there's so many applications for
 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.700
easily there's so many applications for
having some sort of anti-gravity device

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710
having some sort of anti-gravity device
 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.010
having some sort of anti-gravity device
but we don't have one there is no way to

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:44.020
but we don't have one there is no way to
 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.170
but we don't have one there is no way to
shield astronauts here on the earth from

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:46.180
shield astronauts here on the earth from
 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.330
shield astronauts here on the earth from
the effects of gravity we train

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:48.340
the effects of gravity we train
 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.040
the effects of gravity we train
astronauts by putting them up in an

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:50.050
astronauts by putting them up in an
 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:52.020
astronauts by putting them up in an
airplane and then having the airplane

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.030
airplane and then having the airplane
 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.050
airplane and then having the airplane
fly very very carefully on an ark to

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:55.060
fly very very carefully on an ark to
 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:56.880
fly very very carefully on an ark to
throw everybody up at just the right

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:56.890
throw everybody up at just the right
 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.010
throw everybody up at just the right
rate so they're floating it may have

00:00:59.010 --> 00:00:59.020
rate so they're floating it may have
 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:00.090
rate so they're floating it may have
actually happened to you you may have

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.100
actually happened to you you may have
 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.320
actually happened to you you may have
been on an airplane and the airplane

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:01.330
been on an airplane and the airplane
 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:03.390
been on an airplane and the airplane
actually sort of arced around and you

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:03.400
actually sort of arced around and you
 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:04.950
actually sort of arced around and you
felt yourself throwing up a little bit

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:04.960
felt yourself throwing up a little bit
 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.230
felt yourself throwing up a little bit
so that's actually what we do in a very

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.240
so that's actually what we do in a very
 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.930
so that's actually what we do in a very
controlled way we only can get about a

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:09.940
controlled way we only can get about a
 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:11.910
controlled way we only can get about a
minutes worth of weightlessness that way

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920
minutes worth of weightlessness that way
 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.610
minutes worth of weightlessness that way
the airplane flies an arc and then goes

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:14.620
the airplane flies an arc and then goes
 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:16.830
the airplane flies an arc and then goes
around again and flies another one so

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:16.840
around again and flies another one so
 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.480
around again and flies another one so
the astronauts trained by doing this

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490
the astronauts trained by doing this
 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:20.880
the astronauts trained by doing this
over and over and over again one of the

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:20.890
over and over and over again one of the
 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:22.620
over and over and over again one of the
really amazing applications of this was

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:22.630
really amazing applications of this was
 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:24.720
really amazing applications of this was
in the movie Apollo 13 if you look very

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:24.730
in the movie Apollo 13 if you look very
 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:26.640
in the movie Apollo 13 if you look very
carefully that's a very realistic

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:26.650
carefully that's a very realistic
 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:28.410
carefully that's a very realistic
depiction of astronauts floating around

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420
depiction of astronauts floating around
 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.240
depiction of astronauts floating around
in the weightlessness of space and

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250
in the weightlessness of space and
 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:31.410
in the weightlessness of space and
that's because they really were

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420
that's because they really were
 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.840
that's because they really were
weightless they actually put movie sets

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:33.850
weightless they actually put movie sets
 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.930
weightless they actually put movie sets
inside this aircraft and filmed one

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:36.940
inside this aircraft and filmed one
 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:38.910
inside this aircraft and filmed one
minute at a time the footage of the

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:38.920
minute at a time the footage of the
 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.469
minute at a time the footage of the
astronauts floating around the lunar

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:40.479
astronauts floating around the lunar
 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:43.230
astronauts floating around the lunar
module for example now this sort of

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240
module for example now this sort of
 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.120
module for example now this sort of
training where one minute you're

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130
training where one minute you're
 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:46.260
training where one minute you're
weightless and then all of a sudden

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270
weightless and then all of a sudden
 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:47.250
weightless and then all of a sudden
you're not and then you're weightless

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:47.260
you're not and then you're weightless
 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.380
you're not and then you're weightless
again has a bit of an effect on people's

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390
again has a bit of an effect on people's
 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.120
again has a bit of an effect on people's
stomach and in fact the the NASA

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130
stomach and in fact the the NASA
 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:52.740
stomach and in fact the the NASA
nickname for this plane is the vomit

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750
nickname for this plane is the vomit
 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:53.280
nickname for this plane is the vomit
comet

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:53.290
comet
 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:54.840
comet
it's it's something that can actually

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850
it's it's something that can actually
 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:56.130
it's it's something that can actually
make you feel pretty sick to your

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140
make you feel pretty sick to your
 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.080
make you feel pretty sick to your
stomach but a lot of astronauts and

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090
stomach but a lot of astronauts and
 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.840
stomach but a lot of astronauts and
training also find it really fun and the

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850
training also find it really fun and the
 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:02.039
training also find it really fun and the
I've heard it mentioned that there are

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:02.049
I've heard it mentioned that there are
 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:03.660
I've heard it mentioned that there are
some pilots that are better than others

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670
some pilots that are better than others
 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.240
some pilots that are better than others
at doing just the right arc there's some

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250
at doing just the right arc there's some
 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.279
at doing just the right arc there's some
pilots that as you fly you're up against

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289
pilots that as you fly you're up against
 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:09.389
pilots that as you fly you're up against
the ceiling that up against the floor

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399
the ceiling that up against the floor
 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:10.919
the ceiling that up against the floor
and up against the ceiling and then

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929
and up against the ceiling and then
 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:12.449
and up against the ceiling and then
there are ones that get really really

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459
there are ones that get really really
 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:14.009
there are ones that get really really
smooth so you have the longest possible

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:14.019
smooth so you have the longest possible
 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:16.679
smooth so you have the longest possible
time and weightlessness in fact I heard

00:02:16.679 --> 00:02:16.689
time and weightlessness in fact I heard
 

00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:18.629
time and weightlessness in fact I heard
that the pilot that was best at it would

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:18.639
that the pilot that was best at it would
 

00:02:18.639 --> 00:02:19.559
that the pilot that was best at it would
actually put a pen

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:19.569
actually put a pen
 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:21.869
actually put a pen
in front of him as he began the arc to

00:02:21.869 --> 00:02:21.879
in front of him as he began the arc to
 

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:22.949
in front of him as he began the arc to
make it make it feel like you were

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959
make it make it feel like you were
 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:24.660
make it make it feel like you were
weightless and then he would fly the

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670
weightless and then he would fly the
 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.880
weightless and then he would fly the
plane around the pencil trying to keep

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890
plane around the pencil trying to keep
 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:28.559
plane around the pencil trying to keep
that pencil in the same position as he

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:28.569
that pencil in the same position as he
 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:30.809
that pencil in the same position as he
went through the weightlessness arc so

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:30.819
went through the weightlessness arc so
 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:31.830
went through the weightlessness arc so
there's no way we can shield from

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840
there's no way we can shield from
 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.809
there's no way we can shield from
gravity we only can train astronauts a

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:33.819
gravity we only can train astronauts a
 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:36.240
gravity we only can train astronauts a
minute at a time in these aircraft the

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250
minute at a time in these aircraft the
 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.759
minute at a time in these aircraft the
other way we train them is by simulating

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:38.769
other way we train them is by simulating
 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:40.410
other way we train them is by simulating
a weightless environment the best we can

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420
a weightless environment the best we can
 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.929
a weightless environment the best we can
by using water by using really really

00:02:42.929 --> 00:02:42.939
by using water by using really really
 

00:02:42.939 --> 00:02:45.210
by using water by using really really
big swimming pools at the Johnson Space

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220
big swimming pools at the Johnson Space
 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.009
big swimming pools at the Johnson Space
Center one of my favorite places to go

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:47.019
Center one of my favorite places to go
 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:49.589
Center one of my favorite places to go
at all of NASA there is a swimming pool

00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:49.599
at all of NASA there is a swimming pool
 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:52.530
at all of NASA there is a swimming pool
a pool so big that we actually have an

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540
a pool so big that we actually have an
 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.140
a pool so big that we actually have an
entire scale model of the space station

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150
entire scale model of the space station
 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.780
entire scale model of the space station
underneath the water the same size as

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790
underneath the water the same size as
 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.210
underneath the water the same size as
the space station we put astronauts in

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220
the space station we put astronauts in
 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.280
the space station we put astronauts in
you know basically scuba gear they they

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290
you know basically scuba gear they they
 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:03.809
you know basically scuba gear they they
have their helmets there's air being

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:03.819
have their helmets there's air being
 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:05.729
have their helmets there's air being
pumped through there and they can float

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739
pumped through there and they can float
 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:08.069
pumped through there and they can float
around and practice doing spacewalks

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:08.079
around and practice doing spacewalks
 

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:09.869
around and practice doing spacewalks
outside the space station in the water

00:03:09.869 --> 00:03:09.879
outside the space station in the water
 

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:11.670
outside the space station in the water
and then all around them there are

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680
and then all around them there are
 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.440
and then all around them there are
actually real scuba divers ready to

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450
actually real scuba divers ready to
 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:14.819
actually real scuba divers ready to
assist them to make sure everything's

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:14.829
assist them to make sure everything's
 

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:16.679
assist them to make sure everything's
going well and I've had friends who have

00:03:16.679 --> 00:03:16.689
going well and I've had friends who have
 

00:03:16.689 --> 00:03:18.000
going well and I've had friends who have
actually served this way they've

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010
actually served this way they've
 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:19.289
actually served this way they've
actually been scuba divers that help

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:19.299
actually been scuba divers that help
 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:22.259
actually been scuba divers that help
astronauts train so unfortunately

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:22.269
astronauts train so unfortunately
 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:24.599
astronauts train so unfortunately
there's no way to shield from gravity

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:24.609
there's no way to shield from gravity
 

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:26.729
there's no way to shield from gravity
here on the earth gravity is a curvature

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:26.739
here on the earth gravity is a curvature
 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:28.140
here on the earth gravity is a curvature
of space and time

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150
of space and time
 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.449
of space and time
we have no way to manipulate that with

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459
we have no way to manipulate that with
 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:32.580
we have no way to manipulate that with
our current technology so we have to

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590
our current technology so we have to
 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.740
our current technology so we have to
fake it astronauts have to either be in

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750
fake it astronauts have to either be in
 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:36.569
fake it astronauts have to either be in
aircraft that are flying arcs or

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:36.579
aircraft that are flying arcs or
 

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:38.039
aircraft that are flying arcs or
pretending to be weightless under the

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:38.049
pretending to be weightless under the
 

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:41.310
pretending to be weightless under the
water and that's the best we can do

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:41.320
water and that's the best we can do
 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:44.570
water and that's the best we can do
