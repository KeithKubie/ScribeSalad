[Norvig] So now you understand how the key argument to max works,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and now let's assume that we've defined a function called hand_rank,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
which takes a hand as input and returns some sort of a rank.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Now, given that, how would you write the definition of the function poker

00:00:22.000 --> 09:59:59.000
to return the maximum hand according to the highest ranked?
