00:00:08.116 --> 00:00:09.986
&gt;&gt;Teacher: That's incredible.

00:00:09.986 --> 00:00:11.256
That's the best we've seen yet.

00:00:11.366 --> 00:00:13.396
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Fourth and fifth
graders at Clear View Charter School

00:00:13.396 --> 00:00:15.606
in Chula Vista, California, work

00:00:15.606 --> 00:00:17.666
over a two way interactive
video connection

00:00:17.666 --> 00:00:19.356
with scientists at
a local university.

00:00:20.236 --> 00:00:23.146
Together they study insects
under an electron microscope.

00:00:24.746 --> 00:00:25.776
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Okay, introduce
yourselves,

00:00:25.776 --> 00:00:27.016
girls, get in closer, Tammy.

00:00:27.276 --> 00:00:30.046
&gt;&gt;Narrator: This project provides a
hands on understanding of insects,

00:00:30.046 --> 00:00:33.086
far beyond what is possible with
traditional classroom resources.

00:00:38.616 --> 00:00:41.566
Today, students in Jim Dieckmann's
class collect more insects to examine

00:00:41.566 --> 00:00:42.816
under the electron microscope.

00:00:43.516 --> 00:00:48.386
&gt;&gt;Charles: With this insect
project that we're doing,

00:00:49.036 --> 00:00:55.916
somebody could just tell us the parts
of an insect, but we go in depth

00:00:56.146 --> 00:01:00.836
to see closer and learn by ourselves,
instead of somebody else telling us.

00:01:01.036 --> 00:01:03.346
&gt;&gt;Student: Oh, what
kind of bug is that?

00:01:05.026 --> 00:01:06.366
&gt;&gt;Jim: This project
that we've been working

00:01:06.366 --> 00:01:11.096
on with insects is really an effort
to teach students, what is the life

00:01:11.456 --> 00:01:12.996
of a scientist really about?

00:01:13.156 --> 00:01:15.696
What is the scientific
process as well?

00:01:15.796 --> 00:01:19.756
And that's what we're
attempting to do.

00:01:21.116 --> 00:01:23.486
&gt;&gt;Albert: We're studying right
now the mouth parts, most of.

00:01:24.736 --> 00:01:28.216
And see if the-- it c-- if the
difference of what they eat

00:01:28.446 --> 00:01:32.216
and their mouth parts, the
[inaudible] like a beetle

00:01:32.436 --> 00:01:36.216
that eats stuff that has to
crunch, so the mouth part,

00:01:36.216 --> 00:01:38.636
it's like a little
cruncher, like this.

00:01:40.626 --> 00:01:43.906
&gt;&gt;Charles: Its mandibles
are different than ours.

00:01:43.906 --> 00:01:45.006
They're on the side of their mouth.

00:01:45.656 --> 00:01:48.096
It's from here and they
chew this way, not this way.

00:01:48.346 --> 00:01:49.896
They chew like this, not like this.

00:01:50.676 --> 00:01:53.026
&gt;&gt;Howard: We have schools,
because we hope that some day,

00:01:53.126 --> 00:01:55.636
when children have left schools,
that they will still be able

00:01:55.636 --> 00:01:57.616
to use what it is that
they've learned.

00:01:58.026 --> 00:02:02.626
And there is now a massive amount of
evidence from all realms of science,

00:02:03.016 --> 00:02:07.286
that unless individuals take a
very active role in what it is

00:02:07.496 --> 00:02:09.786
that they're studying, unless
they learn to ask questions,

00:02:09.786 --> 00:02:13.926
to do things hands on to essentially
recreate things in their own mind

00:02:13.926 --> 00:02:18.506
and then transform them as is
needed, the ideas just disappear.

00:02:18.606 --> 00:02:21.846
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Charles and Albert
collected several specimens,

00:02:21.846 --> 00:02:24.426
but the wasp they want so
much still eludes them.

00:02:25.456 --> 00:02:28.216
And the class has only two days
before a scheduled online link

00:02:28.216 --> 00:02:29.456
up with the electron microscope.

00:02:30.666 --> 00:02:31.686
&gt;&gt;Jim: They're doing the collection.

00:02:31.686 --> 00:02:33.016
They're doing the preparation.

00:02:33.416 --> 00:02:36.736
They're doing research in order
to try to find out what they can

00:02:36.736 --> 00:02:40.736
about this insect and then trying
to pose some kinds of questions

00:02:40.736 --> 00:02:43.626
that could be answered
through direct observation

00:02:44.036 --> 00:02:45.556
with this powerful tool that we have.

00:02:45.556 --> 00:02:47.626
That's the electron
microscope itself.

00:02:47.766 --> 00:02:49.986
&gt;&gt;Student: If you look just
with the little magnifier,

00:02:50.046 --> 00:02:53.546
you can only see them
about fifteen max.

00:02:53.996 --> 00:03:00.346
But with the electron
microscope, you can go as high

00:03:00.516 --> 00:03:03.356
as seven hundred something
to see 'em.

00:03:03.826 --> 00:03:06.786
And it's kinda interesting that
you can see all the hairs on him,

00:03:06.786 --> 00:03:09.836
and you never thought he
had like little hairs.

00:03:10.166 --> 00:03:14.016
&gt;&gt;Neil: So in one sense, you're
essentially asking the student

00:03:14.016 --> 00:03:17.946
to be a researcher, whereas before
you might have thought the faculty's

00:03:17.946 --> 00:03:19.396
doing research, the
students are learning.

00:03:19.736 --> 00:03:22.436
Now, in effect, you're
saying to the students,

00:03:22.686 --> 00:03:25.326
"Go out and do the research,
which is not bounded,

00:03:25.606 --> 00:03:28.906
which is really limitless, and
keep generating the questions,

00:03:28.906 --> 00:03:31.446
because as you find more and
more information out there,

00:03:31.826 --> 00:03:34.176
you'll find that it
doesn't necessarily coincide

00:03:34.176 --> 00:03:35.516
with your first idea.

00:03:35.746 --> 00:03:37.916
You'll have to change your
idea, then you'll have to look

00:03:37.916 --> 00:03:41.326
for more information to get
that into some kind of sync

00:03:41.326 --> 00:03:42.416
with what you've been thinking."

00:03:42.906 --> 00:03:45.106
Second of all, it becomes
very collaborative,

00:03:45.586 --> 00:03:48.206
and that can be not
just among students.

00:03:48.206 --> 00:03:49.686
It can be between you
and your teacher,

00:03:49.896 --> 00:03:51.806
or it can be with people
in the outside world.

00:03:51.956 --> 00:03:55.646
So once again, you're functioning
almost the way a faculty member

00:03:55.646 --> 00:03:58.736
or an adult in any field
functions as a researcher.

00:03:58.956 --> 00:03:59.476
&gt;&gt;Jim: All right.

00:03:59.746 --> 00:04:02.646
I can see most people are
just continuing on there.

00:04:02.646 --> 00:04:05.046
That's good, jumping around
sometimes a little bit.

00:04:05.186 --> 00:04:07.326
&gt;&gt;You see the students
working around.

00:04:07.326 --> 00:04:10.086
They're pretty much self
motivated and self directed,

00:04:10.376 --> 00:04:14.486
so that it's not all teacher
supervised, teacher directed.

00:04:14.646 --> 00:04:16.156
They take the responsibility,

00:04:16.766 --> 00:04:21.086
and I think that's really
what becomes a real value

00:04:21.216 --> 00:04:23.316
of this particular kind of learning.

00:04:23.366 --> 00:04:26.166
&gt;&gt;James: It isn't enough to
just wait for it to trickle

00:04:26.166 --> 00:04:28.966
down through scholars that
use here and write textbooks.

00:04:29.216 --> 00:04:32.156
It's important to get these
resources directly in the hands

00:04:32.216 --> 00:04:35.826
of young learners, who wouldn't
be able to use the reading rooms

00:04:35.826 --> 00:04:38.056
of the Library of Congress,
but can use this material,

00:04:38.286 --> 00:04:41.136
if we make it more
accessible and user friendly,

00:04:41.136 --> 00:04:42.986
as we're trying to do all the time.

00:04:43.866 --> 00:04:44.786
&gt;&gt;Narrator: To share their research,

00:04:44.956 --> 00:04:46.976
Albert and Charles prepare
a multimedia report.

00:04:47.636 --> 00:04:50.306
&gt;&gt;Computer: Wasps by
Albert and Charles.

00:04:50.306 --> 00:04:53.266
&gt;&gt;Albert: On next-- to the next page.

00:04:53.266 --> 00:04:55.266
&gt;&gt;Computer: Here are
the wasps mating.

00:04:55.266 --> 00:04:57.736
&gt;&gt;Narrator: These interactive
multimedia technologies give students

00:04:57.736 --> 00:05:00.966
a new way to express their ideas and
demonstrate what they've learned.

00:05:01.096 --> 00:05:03.616
&gt;&gt;Albert: We have to make
up a text box for this one.

00:05:03.616 --> 00:05:05.396
&gt;&gt;Charles: Text box.

00:05:05.396 --> 00:05:10.656
&gt;&gt;Jim: Using multimedia, it's just a
tremendous amount of decision making

00:05:10.656 --> 00:05:12.076
that has to be done by the students.

00:05:12.816 --> 00:05:16.336
When they just simply look
at the quantity of resources

00:05:16.336 --> 00:05:18.876
that are available for them to
make this particular report,

00:05:19.186 --> 00:05:20.826
then they have to become
very discriminating

00:05:20.826 --> 00:05:24.726
as to what pieces they need in order
to impart their particular message.

00:05:24.946 --> 00:05:28.086
&gt;&gt;The content is extremely
important to me,

00:05:28.466 --> 00:05:29.626
and that's the area where I push on.

00:05:29.626 --> 00:05:32.116
That's what I do as a
teacher, to push the students

00:05:32.146 --> 00:05:35.976
into finding more information,
to synthesizing that information,

00:05:36.246 --> 00:05:39.396
to putting it in a presentable
form that's understandable to them,

00:05:39.656 --> 00:05:41.276
and to the ultimate user.

00:05:41.476 --> 00:05:46.046
And the components include
looking at the insects themselves

00:05:46.046 --> 00:05:49.846
in the traditional ways that we
might, through text and pictures,

00:05:50.136 --> 00:05:53.586
as well as other images of the
insects that they might find on CDs

00:05:53.906 --> 00:05:55.926
or find via the internet
and download that way.

00:05:56.386 --> 00:05:57.806
&gt;&gt;I'd try Alta Vista.

00:05:57.806 --> 00:06:02.716
That'd be my suggestion too.

00:06:02.716 --> 00:06:03.716
Okay?

00:06:03.946 --> 00:06:04.346
&gt;&gt;Charles: Okay.

00:06:04.956 --> 00:06:05.576
&gt;&gt;Albert: Four thousand.

00:06:05.686 --> 00:06:08.156
&gt;&gt;Jim: Okay, you got four
thousand-- ooh, what's this?

00:06:08.156 --> 00:06:09.836
&gt;&gt;Charles: That's how to get rid of--

00:06:09.866 --> 00:06:10.206
&gt;&gt;Jim: What's that?

00:06:10.206 --> 00:06:11.756
&gt;&gt;Charles: What do to with them.

00:06:12.016 --> 00:06:14.376
&gt;&gt;Jim: It might be useful
for you to just save

00:06:14.436 --> 00:06:17.686
that piece, to read offline, okay?

00:06:17.686 --> 00:06:19.806
'Cause there's awful lot there.

00:06:20.066 --> 00:06:23.166
Then you can just take it
off and read it later on.

00:06:23.516 --> 00:06:26.676
Maybe there's one or two important
points there about controlling wasps

00:06:26.676 --> 00:06:27.886
that would be important to you, okay?

00:06:28.316 --> 00:06:29.076
&gt;&gt;Albert: To catch one.

00:06:29.076 --> 00:06:31.976
&gt;&gt;Jim: How to catch
one, that might be it.

00:06:32.106 --> 00:06:34.296
&gt;&gt;Kristina: If we were back in the
fifteen hundreds, sixteen hundreds,

00:06:34.476 --> 00:06:37.956
and we were Gutenberg, inventing this
printing press, we'd be so delighted

00:06:38.286 --> 00:06:40.146
that we'd be able to take
knowledge and distribute it,

00:06:40.626 --> 00:06:42.906
and also preserve it for
different generations.

00:06:43.596 --> 00:06:46.206
Imagine though, we're
standing at that same point now

00:06:46.696 --> 00:06:49.296
where we're not limited
to just type on a page.

00:06:49.756 --> 00:06:52.206
We can preserve ideas,
we can represent ideas

00:06:52.206 --> 00:06:55.506
in a full component of ways.

00:06:55.506 --> 00:06:57.426
We have images available,
we have sound available.

00:06:57.486 --> 00:06:59.086
We have two way communication
available.

00:06:59.596 --> 00:07:03.336
And that's where we're standing right
now, in terms of the capabilities.

00:07:03.746 --> 00:07:10.386
How we're gonna use those is
the challenge at the moment.

00:07:10.386 --> 00:07:12.776
&gt;&gt;Jim: All right, between
now and recess,

00:07:12.776 --> 00:07:13.956
you have a very important job to do.

00:07:13.956 --> 00:07:15.286
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Many educators
are seeking better ways

00:07:15.286 --> 00:07:16.686
to evaluate student achievement,

00:07:17.326 --> 00:07:19.656
so that the assessment
furthers the learning process.

00:07:19.656 --> 00:07:21.136
&gt;&gt;Jim: Construct a rubric for the--

00:07:21.776 --> 00:07:24.226
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Jim Dieckmann helps the
students create their own standards

00:07:24.226 --> 00:07:26.966
or rubrics for assessing the
quality of their projects.

00:07:27.006 --> 00:07:29.896
&gt;&gt;Jim: -- what would make
a good multimedia project.

00:07:31.266 --> 00:07:35.226
What would be the best
multimedia presentation on insects?

00:07:35.426 --> 00:07:36.676
What would it contain?

00:07:38.546 --> 00:07:44.176
Thinking about content and
also thinking about technique,

00:07:45.296 --> 00:07:46.786
the way in which it's put together.

00:07:48.266 --> 00:07:51.496
You need to take one person who's
going to record the information.

00:07:52.336 --> 00:07:57.826
&gt;&gt;Shirley: It is more difficult
to assess the learning that occurs

00:07:57.826 --> 00:08:02.496
through this kind of project based
experience, that it is not going

00:08:02.496 --> 00:08:07.686
to be assessable through fill
in the bubble kinds of tests,

00:08:07.736 --> 00:08:11.756
that they're gonna have to be
much richer forms of assessment

00:08:12.006 --> 00:08:15.806
that can really capture how much
more the students actually know.

00:08:16.146 --> 00:08:20.236
&gt;&gt;Student: We can make buttons that
can jump to other pages, yeah, links.

00:08:20.426 --> 00:08:23.796
&gt;&gt;Student: About how many?

00:08:23.796 --> 00:08:25.236
&gt;&gt;Jim: In the multimedia project,

00:08:25.236 --> 00:08:28.446
after the students have actually done
a little work with it and done some

00:08:28.446 --> 00:08:30.196
of their research and started

00:08:30.196 --> 00:08:33.696
to actually construct the
project itself, then we sit down

00:08:33.696 --> 00:08:37.716
and we discuss, what is it
that would make the best

00:08:37.716 --> 00:08:39.156
multimedia presentation?

00:08:39.846 --> 00:08:42.356
That then is placed
in the students' hands

00:08:42.786 --> 00:08:45.086
so they know what they're
working towards.

00:08:45.186 --> 00:08:47.916
It's not like, "The teacher's
gonna give me a A, B or C,

00:08:48.246 --> 00:08:50.746
but I don't know what I have
to do to get A, B or C."

00:08:51.076 --> 00:08:53.396
So they have all of that up front

00:08:53.776 --> 00:08:57.816
and I like to have the students help
me develop those particular rubrics,

00:08:57.816 --> 00:08:59.366
'cause they're the ones
that are doing the work.

00:08:59.496 --> 00:09:02.356
&gt;&gt;How about some of the other
tables sharing some information?

00:09:02.566 --> 00:09:05.236
&gt;&gt;Student: It has to
be in your own words.

00:09:05.336 --> 00:09:07.856
&gt;&gt;Jim: Ah, text in
own words; Desiree?

00:09:07.856 --> 00:09:09.666
&gt;&gt;Student: Good punctuation.

00:09:09.766 --> 00:09:12.786
&gt;&gt;Jim: With rubrics that have
been developed by the students,

00:09:12.786 --> 00:09:18.156
they're able to look at what they
have done, self evaluate that,

00:09:18.726 --> 00:09:21.576
get peer feedback and
teacher feedback.

00:09:22.296 --> 00:09:28.026
And what I find is that then
they're internalizing their desire

00:09:28.296 --> 00:09:30.116
to improve their work.

00:09:30.786 --> 00:09:32.596
&gt;&gt;Do we require, for a four,

00:09:32.596 --> 00:09:37.816
that a person have a self
drawn picture or animation?

00:09:38.706 --> 00:09:39.446
That's the question.

00:09:39.676 --> 00:09:42.396
&gt;&gt;Narrator: When expectations are
clear to both students and teachers,

00:09:42.396 --> 00:09:45.356
students develop the ability
to assess their own progress,

00:09:45.356 --> 00:09:47.996
a skill essential for
lifelong learning.

00:09:49.266 --> 00:09:52.976
&gt;&gt;Jim: Okay, I think we just left
out one important part of multimedia.

00:09:53.336 --> 00:09:58.156
When we think of multimedia, we
think of text, graphics and...?

00:09:59.386 --> 00:10:01.446
Amanda's got it behind
you maybe there.

00:10:01.956 --> 00:10:02.396
&gt;&gt;Sound.

00:10:02.396 --> 00:10:05.976
&gt;&gt;Jim: Aha, yes, sound, guys, sound.

00:10:06.286 --> 00:10:10.676
One last time, graphics, sounds--

00:10:11.016 --> 00:10:14.196
&gt;&gt;Grant: We should assess to say,
"All right, here's what you can do.

00:10:14.196 --> 00:10:15.246
Here's what you haven't done.

00:10:15.996 --> 00:10:17.216
How can we help you improve?

00:10:17.436 --> 00:10:21.096
How does this information, how
does this feedback help you know

00:10:21.096 --> 00:10:24.256
and help us know what you
might do to be better?

00:10:24.646 --> 00:10:28.356
&gt;&gt;Raymond: It is not the
skill level that changes.

00:10:28.746 --> 00:10:31.326
Everybody comes out with
the same skill level.

00:10:31.926 --> 00:10:36.186
It's the time it takes that
changes, and some people take two

00:10:36.186 --> 00:10:40.796
and a half times as long
to learn as other people.

00:10:40.796 --> 00:10:45.366
That's the way people are, that's
the way we are in certain areas.

00:10:45.946 --> 00:10:47.266
So when a school finally figures

00:10:47.266 --> 00:10:53.706
out that each student must learn
each step before they go to the next,

00:10:54.156 --> 00:10:57.366
and everybody will be
competent in each step,

00:10:57.676 --> 00:11:01.686
and everybody will make an A, then
we'll change our view of tests.

00:11:02.006 --> 00:11:05.066
&gt;&gt;Jim: Wait a minute, Daniel,
you're not answering my question.

00:11:05.426 --> 00:11:07.036
You're just jamming for someone.

00:11:08.136 --> 00:11:13.026
I don't see the paper in your
hand, I don't see it checked off.

00:11:13.166 --> 00:11:16.646
I haven't seen the discussion that
you've had with your partners, okay?

00:11:16.846 --> 00:11:21.956
We don't just go and get going
without some planning, thank you.

00:11:22.576 --> 00:11:24.826
&gt;&gt;Why don't we just keep
it like this all the time?

00:11:25.096 --> 00:11:28.746
&gt;&gt;Let's just keep it like that,

00:11:29.036 --> 00:11:32.366
and you wanna change the
colors on the inside.

00:11:32.366 --> 00:11:35.416
&gt;&gt;Jim: We do these projects
in the multimedia usually

00:11:35.416 --> 00:11:37.406
with at least groups of
two, sometimes three.

00:11:37.896 --> 00:11:41.836
So in those groups, there's
a great deal of cooperation

00:11:41.836 --> 00:11:43.456
as to what are we going to include?

00:11:43.456 --> 00:11:46.556
A great deal of discussion,
and that's learning in itself.

00:11:47.036 --> 00:11:48.616
&gt;&gt;Go to the disc.

00:11:49.936 --> 00:11:53.516
&gt;&gt;Daniel: Cooperative learning
is a natural living library

00:11:53.516 --> 00:11:57.306
that gives children the chance
to master and practice a set

00:11:57.306 --> 00:11:58.636
of essential skills for life.

00:11:58.636 --> 00:12:00.926
They're skills you could
call emotional intelligence.

00:12:00.926 --> 00:12:03.796
They're how you handle your
own emotions and work things

00:12:03.796 --> 00:12:06.326
out with people, how you
deal with other kids,

00:12:06.326 --> 00:12:08.056
other people in your life.

00:12:08.056 --> 00:12:12.386
Things like managing your temper,
you're not going to be able to blow

00:12:12.386 --> 00:12:13.986
up and work with a group.

00:12:13.986 --> 00:12:16.436
It exerts pressure on you
to learn how to do that.

00:12:16.946 --> 00:12:18.156
&gt;&gt;That looks great.

00:12:18.156 --> 00:12:20.296
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Cooperative
learning, project based learning

00:12:20.296 --> 00:12:22.516
and alternatives to grades to
assess what's been learned?

00:12:22.686 --> 00:12:26.056
This doesn't sound like the
schools most of us went to.

00:12:26.716 --> 00:12:30.516
As these innovations are introduced,

00:12:30.866 --> 00:12:32.996
schools must keep parents
better informed

00:12:33.336 --> 00:12:35.806
and encourage greater involvement
in their children's education.

00:12:37.116 --> 00:12:39.676
When children see their parents
and teachers working together,

00:12:40.256 --> 00:12:43.966
it sends a clear and consistent
message about the value of learning.

00:12:43.966 --> 00:12:48.106
At Clear View Charter, parents meet
regularly with teachers and staff

00:12:48.106 --> 00:12:50.706
to discuss the school
program in an open forum.

00:12:50.986 --> 00:12:54.976
It's an opportunity for teachers to
explain their approaches to learning

00:12:54.976 --> 00:12:56.586
to both parents and students.

00:12:57.466 --> 00:12:59.746
&gt;&gt;Jim: "You might be asking
yourself the question, "Well,

00:12:59.826 --> 00:13:02.916
how do we go about figuring
out, trying to assess whether

00:13:02.916 --> 00:13:05.736
or not students are doing any
real learning while their going

00:13:05.736 --> 00:13:06.696
through this process-- ?"

00:13:06.696 --> 00:13:09.056
&gt;&gt;Education of our
parents is as important

00:13:09.056 --> 00:13:10.726
as education of our children.

00:13:11.126 --> 00:13:15.536
We're out here trying to let
parents know what we're doing

00:13:15.756 --> 00:13:20.886
and why we're doing it; that we're
not giving up on multiplication

00:13:20.886 --> 00:13:22.756
and addition and spelling.

00:13:23.076 --> 00:13:26.436
We're doing all those things, but
we're just doing it in the context

00:13:26.596 --> 00:13:29.386
of using technology to improve
those particular skills.

00:13:29.606 --> 00:13:31.056
&gt;&gt;Parent: How is it
different than learning

00:13:31.056 --> 00:13:33.166
without multimedia
and without computer?

00:13:33.646 --> 00:13:36.846
&gt;&gt;Jim: What I have seen in students
in the last couple of years,

00:13:37.056 --> 00:13:39.626
who have now had the
exposure to technology,

00:13:39.956 --> 00:13:43.786
that are not only computer,
but videotape technology,

00:13:44.636 --> 00:13:48.616
laser disc technology, they
have a very high comfort level

00:13:48.616 --> 00:13:49.746
with that technology.

00:13:49.746 --> 00:13:55.116
But it also provides them
a feeling of accomplishment

00:13:55.406 --> 00:13:59.396
that I have not seen in, say,
traditional forms of education.

00:13:59.446 --> 00:14:01.856
&gt;&gt;Juanita: I mean, I've
seen such improvement

00:14:01.996 --> 00:14:06.986
in Albert's academic work,
reading comprehension.

00:14:06.986 --> 00:14:11.256
Computers, the technology of
computers, has really opened up a lot

00:14:11.366 --> 00:14:18.016
for Albert, and I see him wanting
to come to school, bright early,

00:14:18.016 --> 00:14:18.996
and leave late, you know.

00:14:18.996 --> 00:14:22.126
Always calling me, "Can
I stay a little later?

00:14:22.286 --> 00:14:26.666
I need to finish up a
project," you know, and that's--

00:14:26.666 --> 00:14:29.426
I'm like, "Wow, yeah, sure."

00:14:29.426 --> 00:14:32.056
&gt;&gt;James: The involvement
of the parents and learning

00:14:32.056 --> 00:14:33.706
of the child makes a big difference.

00:14:34.036 --> 00:14:38.546
It is the interaction between
the child and the parent

00:14:38.546 --> 00:14:42.356
that makes the learning meaningful.

00:14:42.646 --> 00:14:46.146
Children are almost
programmed to please adults

00:14:46.146 --> 00:14:52.816
and their first appreciation of
themselves comes from the feedback

00:14:52.816 --> 00:14:54.806
from the important
people around them,

00:14:54.806 --> 00:14:57.166
and the most important
people are the parents.

00:14:57.466 --> 00:14:59.266
&gt;&gt;Jim: Well, it's to
help you tomorrow.

00:14:59.266 --> 00:15:02.966
It's to help you tomorrow when
you're actually directing Steve

00:15:02.966 --> 00:15:03.606
on the Microsoft.

00:15:03.606 --> 00:15:04.276
Let's take a look.

00:15:04.506 --> 00:15:06.866
&gt;&gt;Narrator: It's the day before
Jim Dieckmann's class goes online

00:15:06.866 --> 00:15:08.996
with a scientist using
the electron microscope.

00:15:09.766 --> 00:15:10.906
But after numerous efforts,

00:15:11.046 --> 00:15:13.426
Albert and Charles still
have not caught a wasp.

00:15:13.786 --> 00:15:15.556
&gt;&gt;Albert: Do you know
what kind of bug it is?

00:15:15.556 --> 00:15:16.996
We don't know where it was.

00:15:16.996 --> 00:15:18.276
I just found it on a leaf.

00:15:18.276 --> 00:15:19.076
I don't know if it had--

00:15:19.256 --> 00:15:20.896
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Even with
cutting edge technology,

00:15:21.136 --> 00:15:23.526
learning still has
setback and frustrations.

00:15:24.126 --> 00:15:26.256
&gt;&gt;Jim: Now you did
not collect a wasp.

00:15:26.456 --> 00:15:26.806
&gt;&gt;Yeah.

00:15:27.496 --> 00:15:27.776
&gt;&gt;Did you?

00:15:27.816 --> 00:15:29.756
&gt;&gt;But he found one.

00:15:29.756 --> 00:15:30.966
&gt;&gt;Okay. Where's that?

00:15:31.416 --> 00:15:32.366
&gt;&gt;It's in my garage.

00:15:32.366 --> 00:15:34.346
&gt;&gt;Still in your garage,
flying around, right, okay.

00:15:34.346 --> 00:15:36.886
It's not going to do
us that much good.

00:15:37.206 --> 00:15:39.536
&gt;&gt;Yeah, but we know
where we found it.

00:15:39.536 --> 00:15:44.526
&gt;&gt;Right, but what you
want from the microscope,

00:15:45.326 --> 00:15:49.406
you want something
that looks like a wasp.

00:15:49.516 --> 00:15:54.146
A beetle really doesn't
look like a wasp,

00:15:54.196 --> 00:15:55.626
but some of the other things we have.

00:15:55.626 --> 00:15:56.396
We have a bee.

00:15:56.396 --> 00:15:59.416
&gt;&gt;Yeah, but that's not our thing.

00:15:59.546 --> 00:15:59.846
&gt;&gt;I know.

00:15:59.906 --> 00:16:05.436
&gt;&gt;It has to be a representative.

00:16:06.126 --> 00:16:08.286
&gt;&gt;Jim: Right, now you've
got the picture.

00:16:08.286 --> 00:16:13.296
So the representative insect
collected would be a bee, understand?

00:16:14.516 --> 00:16:19.616
That way you get a chance to
see what the mouth parts look

00:16:19.686 --> 00:16:25.026
like on an animal, an insect
that looks similar to the one

00:16:25.026 --> 00:16:26.516
that you had for your project.

00:16:26.786 --> 00:16:31.436
So do you think this will give
us additional information or not?

00:16:31.436 --> 00:16:31.546
&gt;&gt;Mm-hmm.

00:16:31.546 --> 00:16:32.196
&gt;&gt;Probably so...

00:16:32.196 --> 00:16:33.866
Albert, could you get up here?

00:16:33.936 --> 00:16:35.476
You're kinda hiding down there.

00:16:35.476 --> 00:16:35.746
What?

00:16:35.806 --> 00:16:44.646
&gt;&gt;I don't care; it's not
a wasp and we need a wasp.

00:16:45.986 --> 00:16:47.446
&gt;&gt;Well, you had the opportunity.

00:16:47.626 --> 00:16:51.056
&gt;&gt;I still got it, just
have to get it.

00:16:51.056 --> 00:16:54.676
&gt;&gt;Well, it's a little late,
if we're going online tomorrow

00:16:54.776 --> 00:16:57.846
and it's still flying
around in his garage.

00:16:57.996 --> 00:17:02.346
&gt;&gt;Do it another time.

00:17:02.416 --> 00:17:07.866
&gt;&gt;Okay, I'm not gonna try to force
you to do anything here, Albert,

00:17:08.416 --> 00:17:11.536
but I think if you'll sit down and
think about it, you'll probably come

00:17:11.536 --> 00:17:16.496
up with some kind of a conclusion
about what's gonna be best here.

00:17:16.926 --> 00:17:20.336
&gt;&gt;Linda: Teachers need to be able
to elicit students' thinking.

00:17:20.916 --> 00:17:22.186
They also need to be able

00:17:22.226 --> 00:17:27.496
to interpret what they hear students
saying in terms of their learning.

00:17:27.796 --> 00:17:33.236
What does it mean about students'
progress when they portray a problem

00:17:33.236 --> 00:17:37.106
in a certain way or get stuck
on a particular concept?

00:17:37.586 --> 00:17:43.976
And finally, they need to be able
to continually elicit understandings

00:17:43.976 --> 00:17:48.056
about how kids are
thinking about their work,

00:17:48.516 --> 00:17:51.186
not just whether they
have the right answer.

00:17:51.886 --> 00:17:54.286
So this requires a lot of
new tools for teachers.

00:17:54.286 --> 00:17:58.746
&gt;&gt;Teacher: And probably
an assassin bug or...

00:17:58.746 --> 00:18:01.306
&gt;&gt;Narrator: In San Diego
State University laboratory,

00:18:01.306 --> 00:18:05.476
entomologist Doctor Kathy Williams
and Doctor Steve Barlow prepare

00:18:05.476 --> 00:18:08.996
for a live fiber optic link into Jim
Dieckmann's classroom miles away.

00:18:09.336 --> 00:18:13.076
&gt;&gt;Jim: After them is E8,
E8, was that you, Rodrigo?

00:18:13.406 --> 00:18:14.916
Amanda G, Desiree and Emily.

00:18:14.916 --> 00:18:16.866
&gt;&gt;Narrator: With an electron
microscope, they'll examine

00:18:16.866 --> 00:18:20.166
and discuss the insect specimens
gathered and prepared by Albert,

00:18:20.346 --> 00:18:21.616
Charles and their classmates.

00:18:22.046 --> 00:18:24.046
&gt;&gt;Jim: All right, Steve,
I think we're ready to go.

00:18:25.246 --> 00:18:26.326
Introduce yourselves, boys.

00:18:27.426 --> 00:18:28.456
&gt;&gt;Hi, I'm Charles.

00:18:29.746 --> 00:18:30.826
&gt;&gt;Hi, I'm Albert.

00:18:31.496 --> 00:18:32.486
&gt;&gt;And my name's Patrick.

00:18:33.676 --> 00:18:35.646
&gt;&gt;Steve: Okay, so we'll start
with your first sample now?

00:18:36.146 --> 00:18:36.276
&gt;&gt;Yeah.

00:18:36.636 --> 00:18:40.816
&gt;&gt;Okay, all right, so
this is the head of it.

00:18:41.176 --> 00:18:45.116
Now last week we were talking about
looking at mouth parts, correct?

00:18:45.386 --> 00:18:45.546
&gt;&gt;All: Yes.

00:18:46.286 --> 00:18:47.996
&gt;&gt;Steve: Okay, so here
you can see the two eyes

00:18:48.976 --> 00:18:51.596
and in the center is kind of
this long, looks like a nose.

00:18:52.996 --> 00:18:56.356
And then down at the
very end of the nose,

00:18:57.946 --> 00:19:00.026
we increase the magnification here.

00:19:04.316 --> 00:19:04.706
&gt;&gt;What is that?

00:19:06.936 --> 00:19:07.806
&gt;&gt;What does it look like?

00:19:08.916 --> 00:19:09.396
&gt;&gt;Mouth.

00:19:12.316 --> 00:19:12.686
&gt;&gt;Teeth?

00:19:12.806 --> 00:19:14.766
&gt;&gt;Kathy: Looks a lot like teeth.

00:19:14.866 --> 00:19:16.016
What do you think they use it for?

00:19:16.736 --> 00:19:18.246
&gt;&gt;Probably to catch food.

00:19:19.296 --> 00:19:22.066
&gt;&gt;Kathy: Well, that's a good
start, that's a good idea.

00:19:22.316 --> 00:19:24.526
It's really tiny though,
if you think about it,

00:19:24.986 --> 00:19:27.086
so what kind of food
would they get with that,

00:19:27.606 --> 00:19:29.246
with little tiny teeth like that?

00:19:30.016 --> 00:19:30.226
&gt;&gt;Gnats.

00:19:30.646 --> 00:19:31.806
&gt;&gt;Okay, gnats.

00:19:32.316 --> 00:19:33.866
&gt;&gt;Tiny flies.

00:19:33.936 --> 00:19:35.356
&gt;&gt;Okay, maybe tiny flies.

00:19:36.056 --> 00:19:39.366
&gt;&gt;Do you know of the sand bee,

00:19:40.446 --> 00:19:45.006
do the mouth parts look
like a bee or a wasp?

00:19:45.146 --> 00:19:47.626
&gt;&gt;Kathy: Well, what do you think?

00:19:47.626 --> 00:19:50.086
Do you have any ideas about that?

00:19:50.086 --> 00:19:52.436
&gt;&gt;I think yeah, because
they're related.

00:19:53.046 --> 00:19:55.816
&gt;&gt;That's right, the bees
and the wasps have a lot

00:19:55.816 --> 00:19:57.556
of similarities in their mouth parts.

00:19:58.376 --> 00:20:00.206
You're getting to be
good entomologists there.

00:20:01.196 --> 00:20:05.256
&gt;&gt;Albert: 'Cause me and Charles
are doing a project on wasps.

00:20:05.696 --> 00:20:06.976
But we haven't found the wasp,

00:20:07.286 --> 00:20:08.746
so we just did the sand
bee and we looked at the--

00:20:09.586 --> 00:20:14.026
&gt;&gt;Jim: The contribution of
Doctor Williams was incredible,

00:20:14.156 --> 00:20:18.216
because she was giving information,
she was engaging the students

00:20:18.216 --> 00:20:22.326
in conversation, she was asking the
students questions, thereby they had

00:20:22.326 --> 00:20:25.626
to formulate their
thinking to respond.

00:20:26.056 --> 00:20:29.366
And that's what's important, because
we can look at things all day,

00:20:29.816 --> 00:20:33.336
but if we don't formulate some
kind of a response to what we see,

00:20:34.076 --> 00:20:35.876
we're just taking in information.

00:20:36.156 --> 00:20:37.966
We're not synthesizing it in any way.

00:20:38.686 --> 00:20:41.766
So that's what I feel the value of
the experts and the interaction,

00:20:42.066 --> 00:20:44.196
is what gives the students
the impetus

00:20:44.196 --> 00:20:46.146
to internalize some of the learning.

00:20:47.226 --> 00:20:49.256
&gt;&gt;John: I think that the
changes we see happening today

00:20:49.256 --> 00:20:53.246
in these technology enriched
environments are very important

00:20:53.976 --> 00:20:54.966
for two reasons.

00:20:55.266 --> 00:20:58.476
First of all, what you find is

00:20:58.476 --> 00:21:02.526
that these environments are
encouraging kids to engage constantly

00:21:02.526 --> 00:21:05.796
in an active search, and then
taking what they're finding,

00:21:06.156 --> 00:21:08.156
combining it with what
other kids have found,

00:21:08.256 --> 00:21:10.166
and working kinda collaboratively

00:21:10.166 --> 00:21:12.646
on constructing something
with what they find.

00:21:13.086 --> 00:21:16.956
So they're learning how to search,
how to challenge what they find

00:21:16.956 --> 00:21:19.416
and then how to combine
what they find with others.

00:21:19.806 --> 00:21:21.016
Now if there's anything we learn

00:21:21.016 --> 00:21:25.566
in kinda corporate America today is
the absolute importance of teamwork.

00:21:26.736 --> 00:21:30.876
It's so ironic to me that in the
schools we focus almost exclusively

00:21:30.876 --> 00:21:34.806
in the past on the
performance of the individual,

00:21:34.906 --> 00:21:36.686
often at the cost of
other individuals.

00:21:37.426 --> 00:21:40.426
Whereas when you get into the
workplace, it's really the ability

00:21:40.426 --> 00:21:43.336
to productively work with
others that really matters.
