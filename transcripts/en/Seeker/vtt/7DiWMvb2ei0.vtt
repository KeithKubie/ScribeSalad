00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:07.010
After the Apollo 1 disaster, NASA had to retrace
its every move, piecing together the reasons

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:11.540
why the first manned mission went catastrophically
wrong.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:25.320
Three astronauts were dead and the space program
was on pause.

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.000
And while it was one of the darkest times
in NASA’s history,

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:36.840
the tragic accident likely saved the Apollo Program.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:48.320
Up until Apollo 1, the United States was making
major progress on its mission to the moon.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:53.880
But, eventually, speed surpassed safety, and
it ended in disaster.

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:59.540
For months after the fatal fire, NASA’s
investigators tore apart the charred Apollo 1 spacecraft.

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:04.100
The exact cause of the blaze was never identified,
but the final report highlighted a number

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:08.640
of factors including the spacecraft’s pure
oxygen environment, the amount of combustible

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.580
materials in the crew cabin and the inward-opening
hatch.

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.700
Many of these issues were raised by the Apollo
1 astronauts.

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:22.040
But the crew, along with NASA, knew that the Apollo missions walked a dangerous line of risk and reward.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.160
Before his fatal mission, Apollo 1 Command
Pilot, Gus Grissom, wrote that “The conquest

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.200
of space is worth the risk of life".

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:36.080
To prove that the astronaut's deaths weren't
in vain, NASA decided to rebuild.

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.880
The Apollo spacecraft
immediately underwent major modifications.

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:45.700
Unlike the block I Command-Service Modules, the redesigned spacecraft, the block II CSM,

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.820
was equipped with an outward-opening hatch

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.240
that could be released from the inside in
seven seconds.

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.200
Arguably, the most incriminating error with
the Apollo 1 spacecraft was the fact that

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.119
the sealed cabin was pressurized with 100-percent
oxygen.

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:03.590
This system would likely operate safely in space,
but at sea-level, the high pressure made the

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.420
Apollo 1 spacecraft extremely combustible.

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.150
So moving forward, NASA would use a mixed
gas atmosphere while on the launch pad and

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.209
then switch to a single pure oxygen atmosphere
once in space.

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:18.769
Along with fireproofing as much of the CSM
as possible, the agency also made structural

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:22.680
changes to its launch complex and mandated
strict safety procedures

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.980
for both astronauts and ground control.

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:31.020
NASA also needed to decide how it would proceed
with the subsequent Apollo missions.

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.500
Ultimately, the agency decided that its next
three uncrewed missions would be dubbed

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.360
Apollo 4, 5 and 6.

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.430
The missions would carry out test flights
for the Saturn V rocket, redesigned CSM spacecraft

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.779
and Lunar Module.

00:02:45.779 --> 00:02:51.569
About 20 months after the fire, NASA was ready
for another manned Apollo mission.

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:58.260
On October 11, 1968, Apollo 7 successfully
took to the sky and entered orbit.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.799
The mission’s objective was to ensure the
redesigned CSM was capable of operating

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:03.809
effectively in Earth orbit.

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:07.669
The Mission Commander, Wally Schirra, was
the only astronaut to fly in the Mercury,

00:03:07.669 --> 00:03:09.660
Gemini and Apollo programs.

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.169
He was joined by rookies, Walter Cunningham
and Donn Eisele.

00:03:13.169 --> 00:03:16.280
All eyes were on the Apollo 7 team, literally.

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:25.279
The crew, albeit reluctantly, put on the first
live TV broadcast in space.

00:03:25.279 --> 00:03:29.980
Nicknamed the “Wally, Walt, and Donn Show”,
during the transmissions, the astronauts entertained

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:36.100
viewers by showing off the effects of microgravity
and preparing hot meals in their tiny cabin.

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:41.140
Everything seemed to be working perfectly, well, everything except the astronauts' immune systems.

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.880
The entire crew was hit with a nasty cold.

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:50.180
And in space, fluids don't drain like they do
on Earth, so their symptoms were exceptionally bad.

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:54.739
Despite the added discomfort and difficulty,
the Apollo 7 crew successfully tested the

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:59.930
major aspects of the redesigned CSM, including
the engine, which in later missions would

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:03.980
need to fire the spacecraft into and out of
the moon’s orbit.

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:08.560
Once ready to return home, the astronauts
fired the service module’s propulsion system,

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.819
inserting the spacecraft into a trans-Earth
injection.

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:16.019
The command module’s heat shield proved
capable of withstanding nearly 3,000 degrees

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:18.139
celsius during descent.

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:22.900
The parachutes deployed and the spacecraft
safely splashed down in the Atlantic Ocean.

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:28.400
After 10 days and 20 hours, the Apollo 7 astronauts
were finally able to blow their noses.

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:33.680
The successful end to the Apollo 7 mission
proved that NASA’s hard reset was worth it.

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:38.380
In the months since the Apollo fire, the space
program reinvented itself, showing that it

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:41.420
was dedicated to ensuring the safety of its
own.

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:46.840
But unforeseen circumstances would force NASA
to once again rapidly change course and take

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.740
on an even greater risk for Apollo 8.

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:53.340
What was supposed to be another mission within
Earth’s orbit, wound up becoming a dangerous

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:57.180
trek to the far side of the moon.

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:02.240
In 1968, the same year as Apollo 7, NASA marked
its tenth anniversary.

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:05.760
