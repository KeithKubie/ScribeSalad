00:00:00.753 --> 00:00:03.392
- [Instructor] The continuous
function g is graphed.

00:00:03.392 --> 00:00:05.786
We're interested in the
area under the curve

00:00:05.786 --> 00:00:08.664
between x equals negative
seven and x equals seven,

00:00:08.664 --> 00:00:11.546
and we're considering using
Riemann sums to approximate it.

00:00:11.546 --> 00:00:12.995
So this is the area that thinking about

00:00:12.995 --> 00:00:14.560
in this light blue color.

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:18.805
Order the areas from least
on top to greatest on bottom.

00:00:18.805 --> 00:00:21.707
So this is a screenshot
from a Khan Academy exercise

00:00:21.707 --> 00:00:22.632
where you would be expected

00:00:22.632 --> 00:00:24.986
to actually click and drag these around.

00:00:24.986 --> 00:00:26.034
But it's just a screenshot.

00:00:26.034 --> 00:00:28.322
So what I'm gonna do instead
of dragging them around,

00:00:28.322 --> 00:00:30.287
I'm just gonna write numbers ordering them

00:00:30.287 --> 00:00:33.480
from least to greatest
where one would be the least

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.430
and then three would be the greatest.

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:38.293
So pause this video and
try to think about these.

00:00:38.293 --> 00:00:40.451
Which of these is the least,
which is in the middle,

00:00:40.451 --> 00:00:43.013
and which is the greatest?

00:00:43.013 --> 00:00:45.621
So let's just draw out
what a left Riemann sum,

00:00:45.621 --> 00:00:47.496
a right Riemann sum
would actually look like,

00:00:47.496 --> 00:00:50.128
and compare it to the actual area.

00:00:50.128 --> 00:00:54.467
And we could do an arbitrary
number of subdivisions.

00:00:54.467 --> 00:00:56.496
I would encourage us to do fewer

00:00:56.496 --> 00:00:59.201
because we're just trying to
get a general sense of things.

00:00:59.201 --> 00:01:01.451
And they don't even have
to be equal subdivisions.

00:01:01.451 --> 00:01:03.373
So let's start with the left Riemann sum.

00:01:03.373 --> 00:01:07.738
So we wanna start at x
equals negative seven,

00:01:07.738 --> 00:01:10.938
and we wanna go to x equals seven.

00:01:10.938 --> 00:01:12.112
Well, let's say that this is

00:01:12.112 --> 00:01:15.280
the first rectangle right over here.

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.758
So this is our first subdivision.

00:01:17.758 --> 00:01:18.995
And it's a left Riemann sum,

00:01:18.995 --> 00:01:20.528
so we would use the value of the function

00:01:20.528 --> 00:01:22.234
at the left end of that subdivision,

00:01:22.234 --> 00:01:24.615
which is negative seven,
x equals negative seven.

00:01:24.615 --> 00:01:26.961
The value of the function there is 12.

00:01:26.961 --> 00:01:28.706
And so this would be our first rectangle.

00:01:28.706 --> 00:01:29.804
You already get a sense that this

00:01:29.804 --> 00:01:33.746
is gonna be an overestimate
relative to the actual area.

00:01:33.746 --> 00:01:35.957
And so the next subdivision
would start here,

00:01:35.957 --> 00:01:38.800
so this would be our
height of our rectangle.

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.682
And once again, they don't
have to be equal subdivisions.

00:01:41.682 --> 00:01:44.159
They often are, but I'm just
show you unequal subdivision

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.936
just to show you that this
is still a valid Riemann sum.

00:01:46.936 --> 00:01:49.879
And once again, this is an overestimate

00:01:49.879 --> 00:01:52.699
where the actual area that
we're trying to approximate

00:01:52.699 --> 00:01:55.207
is smaller than the
area of this rectangle.

00:01:55.207 --> 00:01:57.262
And then let's say the third
subdivision right over here

00:01:57.262 --> 00:01:59.729
starts right over there at x equals three.

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.023
And we use the left
end of the subdivision,

00:02:02.023 --> 00:02:03.508
the value of the function there,

00:02:03.508 --> 00:02:05.081
to define the height of the rectangle.

00:02:05.081 --> 00:02:08.432
And once again, you see
it is an overestimate.

00:02:08.432 --> 00:02:12.599
So the left Riemann sum is
clearly an overestimate.

00:02:14.317 --> 00:02:16.484
And it's pretty clear why.

00:02:17.847 --> 00:02:19.677
This function never increases.

00:02:19.677 --> 00:02:20.833
It's either decreasing,

00:02:20.833 --> 00:02:23.643
or it looks like it stays
flat at certain points.

00:02:23.643 --> 00:02:26.883
And so for a function
like that, the left edge,

00:02:26.883 --> 00:02:29.018
the value of the function at the left edge

00:02:29.018 --> 00:02:31.940
is going to be just as high or higher

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.440
than any other value the function takes on

00:02:36.348 --> 00:02:38.561
over that interval for the subdivision.

00:02:38.561 --> 00:02:41.635
And so you get left with
all of this extra area

00:02:41.635 --> 00:02:45.176
that is part of the overestimate.

00:02:45.176 --> 00:02:48.529
Or this area that is
larger than the actual area

00:02:48.529 --> 00:02:50.266
that you're trying to approximate.

00:02:50.266 --> 00:02:52.135
Now let's think about a right Riemann sum.

00:02:52.135 --> 00:02:53.866
And I'll do different subdivisions.

00:02:53.866 --> 00:02:55.078
Let's say the first subdivision goes

00:02:55.078 --> 00:02:57.544
from negative seven to negative five.

00:02:57.544 --> 00:03:01.254
And here we would use the right
edge to define the height.

00:03:01.254 --> 00:03:04.660
So f of negative five, or g of
negative five, I should say.

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.345
So that's right over there.

00:03:06.345 --> 00:03:07.869
That's our first rectangle.

00:03:07.869 --> 00:03:12.144
Maybe our next rectangle,
the right edge is zero.

00:03:12.144 --> 00:03:15.674
So this would be it right over there.

00:03:15.674 --> 00:03:17.931
And then maybe we'll do four rectangles.

00:03:17.931 --> 00:03:20.956
Maybe our third subdivision,

00:03:20.956 --> 00:03:25.167
the right edge is at x is equal to three.

00:03:25.167 --> 00:03:28.458
So it would be right over there.

00:03:28.458 --> 00:03:30.941
And then our fourth subdivision,

00:03:30.941 --> 00:03:32.710
let's just do it x equals seven.

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:34.702
And we're using the right
edge of the subdivisions.

00:03:34.702 --> 00:03:36.487
Remember, this is a right Riemann sum,

00:03:36.487 --> 00:03:37.673
so we use the right edge.

00:03:37.673 --> 00:03:40.942
The value of the function
there is just like that.

00:03:40.942 --> 00:03:44.168
And now you can see for any
one of these subdivisions,

00:03:44.168 --> 00:03:46.361
our rectangles are under estimates

00:03:46.361 --> 00:03:48.695
of the area under the curve.

00:03:48.695 --> 00:03:50.445
Under, underestimate.

00:03:52.243 --> 00:03:55.513
And that's because once again,
in this particular case,

00:03:55.513 --> 00:03:57.842
the function never increases.

00:03:57.842 --> 00:04:00.347
It's either decreasing or staying flat.

00:04:00.347 --> 00:04:02.676
So if you use the value of the
function at the right edge,

00:04:02.676 --> 00:04:05.481
it's going to be smaller,

00:04:05.481 --> 00:04:07.786
it's never going to be
large than the value

00:04:07.786 --> 00:04:11.936
that the function takes on in
the rest of that subdivision.

00:04:11.936 --> 00:04:14.903
And so we are continuously
underestimating.

00:04:14.903 --> 00:04:17.028
We're missing this.

00:04:17.028 --> 00:04:21.350
All of this area right over
there is not being included.

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:22.657
So we have an underestimate.

00:04:22.657 --> 00:04:25.913
So if wanna rank these
from least to greatest,

00:04:25.913 --> 00:04:28.666
well, the right Riemann sum is the least.

00:04:28.666 --> 00:04:30.502
It is underestimating it.

00:04:30.502 --> 00:04:32.459
Then you have the actual
area of the curve,

00:04:32.459 --> 00:04:34.563
which is just the area
of the curve. (laughs)

00:04:34.563 --> 00:04:37.092
And then you have the left Riemann sum,

00:04:37.092 --> 00:04:39.259
which is the overestimate.
