from the surface of things and you look

00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:56.470
from the surface of things and you look
 

00:09:56.470 --> 00:09:57.930
from the surface of things and you look
in and you see what you find it

00:09:57.930 --> 00:09:57.940
in and you see what you find it
 

00:09:57.940 --> 00:09:59.519
in and you see what you find it
oftentimes you find things that are very

do you make a situation work like that

00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:37.320
do you make a situation work like that
 

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:40.430
do you make a situation work like that
work for everybody that's the the second

sort of practical problem that launches
that has launched this this work I'm

00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:45.870
that has launched this this work I'm
 

00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:48.190
that has launched this this work I'm
going to talk a lot in this talk about

00:11:48.190 --> 00:11:48.200
going to talk a lot in this talk about
 

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:51.380
going to talk a lot in this talk about
the academic focus of this research but

00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:51.390
the academic focus of this research but
 

00:11:51.390 --> 00:11:52.760
the academic focus of this research but
I hope that you'll get at least as a

00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:52.770
I hope that you'll get at least as a
 

00:11:52.770 --> 00:11:55.520
I hope that you'll get at least as a
back theme some idea about how these

00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:55.530
back theme some idea about how these
 

00:11:55.530 --> 00:11:58.310
back theme some idea about how these
processes working in your own lives I do

00:11:58.310 --> 00:11:58.320
processes working in your own lives I do
 

00:11:58.320 --> 00:11:59.540
processes working in your own lives I do
think that everybody experiences

00:11:59.540 --> 00:11:59.550
think that everybody experiences
 

00:11:59.550 --> 00:12:01.370
think that everybody experiences
stereotype threat at least a couple of

00:12:01.370 --> 00:12:01.380
stereotype threat at least a couple of
 

00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:04.490
stereotype threat at least a couple of
times a day and I hope by the end of the

00:12:04.490 --> 00:12:04.500
times a day and I hope by the end of the
 

00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:05.870
times a day and I hope by the end of the
talk you have a sense of when you're

00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:05.880
talk you have a sense of when you're
 

00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:07.340
talk you have a sense of when you're
experiencing and when you're not and

00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:07.350
experiencing and when you're not and
 

00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:08.810
experiencing and when you're not and
what it's about and what the reactions

00:12:08.810 --> 00:12:08.820
what it's about and what the reactions
 

00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:12.050
what it's about and what the reactions
to it might be so I have both a focus

00:12:12.050 --> 00:12:12.060
to it might be so I have both a focus
 

00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:13.650
to it might be so I have both a focus
and a larger

00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:13.660
and a larger
 

00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:15.850
and a larger
ambition for what what you get out of

00:12:15.850 --> 00:12:15.860
ambition for what what you get out of
 

00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:20.350
ambition for what what you get out of
this the organization will be a little

00:12:20.350 --> 00:12:20.360
this the organization will be a little
 

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:22.449
this the organization will be a little
bit of theory a little bit of evidence

00:12:22.449 --> 00:12:22.459
bit of theory a little bit of evidence
 

00:12:22.459 --> 00:12:24.639
bit of theory a little bit of evidence
and then a little bit of remedy what to

00:12:24.639 --> 00:12:24.649
and then a little bit of remedy what to
 

00:12:24.649 --> 00:12:27.370
and then a little bit of remedy what to
do about this this problem so it will

00:12:27.370 --> 00:12:27.380
do about this this problem so it will
 

00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:29.530
do about this this problem so it will
sound maybe a little analytical and a

00:12:29.530 --> 00:12:29.540
sound maybe a little analytical and a
 

00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:32.860
sound maybe a little analytical and a
little of boy he's for separating on the

00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:32.870
little of boy he's for separating on the
 

00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:34.690
little of boy he's for separating on the
difficulties but at the end I'm working

00:12:34.690 --> 00:12:34.700
difficulties but at the end I'm working
 

00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:37.120
difficulties but at the end I'm working
towards some framework for remedy and

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:37.130
towards some framework for remedy and
 

00:12:37.130 --> 00:12:39.160
towards some framework for remedy and
solution and I think over the last six

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:39.170
solution and I think over the last six
 

00:12:39.170 --> 00:12:40.480
solution and I think over the last six
years that's where the most exciting

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:40.490
years that's where the most exciting
 

00:12:40.490 --> 00:12:44.400
years that's where the most exciting
research in this area has been focused

00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:44.410
research in this area has been focused
 

00:12:44.410 --> 00:12:48.460
research in this area has been focused
okay I'll begin with a very simple

which we belong and I really put that up
 

00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:09.160
which we belong and I really put that up
so that you'll see the long list of

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:09.170
so that you'll see the long list of
 

00:13:09.170 --> 00:13:11.800
so that you'll see the long list of
social identities that we we have age

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:11.810
social identities that we we have age
 

00:13:11.810 --> 00:13:14.199

are all social identities that that they

are all social identities that that they
all meet that definition and one way of

00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:27.110
all meet that definition and one way of
 

00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:28.750
all meet that definition and one way of
thinking about the the thrust of this

00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:28.760
thinking about the the thrust of this
 

00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:31.210
thinking about the the thrust of this
research is what is it that makes a

00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:31.220
research is what is it that makes a
 

00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:33.519
research is what is it that makes a
given social identity very important to

00:13:33.519 --> 00:13:33.529
given social identity very important to
 

00:13:33.529 --> 00:13:36.190
given social identity very important to
us and important in how we function and

00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:36.200
us and important in how we function and
 

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:38.530
us and important in how we function and
we have a very simple answer to that

00:13:38.530 --> 00:13:38.540
we have a very simple answer to that
 

00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:40.569
we have a very simple answer to that
question maybe maybe it's too simple but

00:13:40.569 --> 00:13:40.579
question maybe maybe it's too simple but
 

00:13:40.579 --> 00:13:43.630
question maybe maybe it's too simple but
we're pushing it right now the answer is

00:13:43.630 --> 00:13:43.640
we're pushing it right now the answer is
 

00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:46.750
we're pushing it right now the answer is
if the things you have to deal with in

00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:46.760
if the things you have to deal with in
 

00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:48.910
if the things you have to deal with in
particular situations because you have

00:13:48.910 --> 00:13:48.920
particular situations because you have
 

00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:51.310
particular situations because you have
the identity if you have to deal with

00:13:51.310 --> 00:13:51.320
the identity if you have to deal with
 

00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:53.949
the identity if you have to deal with
things in situations because you have

00:13:53.949 --> 00:13:53.959
things in situations because you have
 

00:13:53.959 --> 00:13:56.050
things in situations because you have
the identity then that identity is

00:13:56.050 --> 00:13:56.060
the identity then that identity is
 

00:13:56.060 --> 00:13:57.850
the identity then that identity is
likely to become very important to you

00:13:57.850 --> 00:13:57.860
likely to become very important to you
 

00:13:57.860 --> 00:14:00.460
likely to become very important to you
that's the argument if you do not have

00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:00.470
that's the argument if you do not have
 

00:14:00.470 --> 00:14:02.880
that's the argument if you do not have
to deal with things that are of great

00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:02.890
to deal with things that are of great
 

00:14:02.890 --> 00:14:05.410
to deal with things that are of great
importance to you based on having an

00:14:05.410 --> 00:14:05.420
importance to you based on having an
 

00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:07.810
importance to you based on having an
identity then that identity is is it's

00:14:07.810 --> 00:14:07.820
identity then that identity is is it's
 

00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:10.269
identity then that identity is is it's

it may be something you have a

it may be something you have a
historical interest in there are ways of

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:15.170
historical interest in there are ways of
 

00:14:15.170 --> 00:14:17.199
historical interest in there are ways of
relating to it but it won't be central

00:14:17.199 --> 00:14:17.209
relating to it but it won't be central
 

00:14:17.209 --> 00:14:18.939
relating to it but it won't be central
to how you function on a daily basis

00:14:18.939 --> 00:14:18.949
to how you function on a daily basis

to how you function on a daily basis
that's the strong argument the thing

00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:21.680
that's the strong argument the thing
 

00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:25.269
that's the strong argument the thing

I'll give you an example I have been
 

00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:39.260
I'll give you an example I have been
writing this book and it does have a bit

writing this book and it does have a bit
 

00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:41.300

of a memoir structure to it and at one
 

00:14:41.310 --> 00:14:44.750
of a memoir structure to it and at one
point I remember asking myself what is

point I remember asking myself what is
 

00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:48.200

when I was in the second or third grade
 

00:15:01.590 --> 00:15:03.380
when I was in the second or third grade
and it was like the last day of school

and we were on our way home from school
and somebody started talking about the

00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:08.130
and somebody started talking about the
 

00:15:08.130 --> 00:15:10.040
and somebody started talking about the
fact that we couldn't go to the swimming

00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:10.050
fact that we couldn't go to the swimming
 

00:15:10.050 --> 00:15:12.340

except on Wednesday afternoons and I I
just I just couldn't believe that and

just I just couldn't believe that and
 

00:15:18.270 --> 00:15:19.850
just I just couldn't believe that and
yeah the idea was that we couldn't go to

00:15:19.850 --> 00:15:19.860

kind of discourse about this and people
 

00:15:27.750 --> 00:15:29.390
kind of discourse about this and people
are trying to figure it out and we're

are trying to figure it out and we're
 

00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:31.610
are trying to figure it out and we're
we're all upset about it and what could

this mean and you know an
eight-year-olds mind is struggling with

00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:36.870
eight-year-olds mind is struggling with
 

00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:39.380
eight-year-olds mind is struggling with
this with this question and and you know

00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:39.390
this with this question and and you know
 

00:15:39.390 --> 00:15:40.910
this with this question and and you know
questions that you're never going to get

00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:40.920
questions that you're never going to get
 

00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:42.680
questions that you're never going to get
an answer to what why is this the

00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:42.690
an answer to what why is this the
 

00:15:42.690 --> 00:15:44.420
an answer to what why is this the
important to everybody that we can't go

00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:44.430
important to everybody that we can't go
 

00:15:44.430 --> 00:15:45.980
important to everybody that we can't go
swimming everybody else can go swimming

00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:45.990
swimming everybody else can go swimming
 

00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:48.590
swimming everybody else can go swimming
all the time and we can't goes with it's

00:15:48.590 --> 00:15:48.600
all the time and we can't goes with it's
 

00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:51.650
all the time and we can't goes with it's
a question and the most important

00:15:51.650 --> 00:15:51.660
a question and the most important
 

00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:53.600
a question and the most important
feature of the question I think for the

00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:53.610
feature of the question I think for the
 

00:15:53.610 --> 00:15:55.610
feature of the question I think for the
purpose for the purposes I'm using it

00:15:55.610 --> 00:15:55.620
purpose for the purposes I'm using it
 

00:15:55.620 --> 00:15:58.010
purpose for the purposes I'm using it
here is to is that it's the question

00:15:58.010 --> 00:15:58.020
here is to is that it's the question
 

00:15:58.020 --> 00:15:59.270
here is to is that it's the question
that makes you aware you've got an

00:15:59.270 --> 00:15:59.280
that makes you aware you've got an
 

00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:02.090
that makes you aware you've got an
identity that you are black that it has

00:16:02.090 --> 00:16:02.100
identity that you are black that it has
 

00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:03.560
identity that you are black that it has
some particular meaning in this

00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:03.570
some particular meaning in this
 

00:16:03.570 --> 00:16:05.240
some particular meaning in this
situation you don't know what it is you

00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:05.250
situation you don't know what it is you
 

00:16:05.250 --> 00:16:06.740
situation you don't know what it is you
don't know why it is you don't know when

00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:06.750
don't know why it is you don't know when
 

00:16:06.750 --> 00:16:08.210
don't know why it is you don't know when
it's gonna be relevant to you when it's

00:16:08.210 --> 00:16:08.220
it's gonna be relevant to you when it's
 

00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:09.860
it's gonna be relevant to you when it's
not gonna be relevant to you but this is

00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:09.870
not gonna be relevant to you but this is
 

00:16:09.870 --> 00:16:12.050
not gonna be relevant to you but this is
like a scary fact because it means that

00:16:12.050 --> 00:16:12.060
like a scary fact because it means that
 

00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:13.700
like a scary fact because it means that
at some point it could be relevant to

00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:13.710
at some point it could be relevant to
 

00:16:13.710 --> 00:16:16.610
at some point it could be relevant to
you you can't put it down you'd like to

00:16:16.610 --> 00:16:16.620
you you can't put it down you'd like to
 

00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:19.280
you you can't put it down you'd like to
put it down but you can't put it down so

00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:19.290
put it down but you can't put it down so
 

00:16:19.290 --> 00:16:21.410
put it down but you can't put it down so
it becomes something that moves inside

00:16:21.410 --> 00:16:21.420
it becomes something that moves inside
 

00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:24.050
it becomes something that moves inside
and you start to think about it and you

00:16:24.050 --> 00:16:24.060
and you start to think about it and you
 

00:16:24.060 --> 00:16:25.790
and you start to think about it and you
elaborate it and you relate to other

00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:25.800
elaborate it and you relate to other
 

00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:27.470
elaborate it and you relate to other
people on the basis of who has the

00:16:27.470 --> 00:16:27.480
people on the basis of who has the
 

00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:28.790
people on the basis of who has the

but I suppose the main point I'm trying
 

00:17:14.589 --> 00:17:17.220
but I suppose the main point I'm trying
to make with this illustration is that

00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:17.230
to make with this illustration is that

situations that's that's a claim and the

00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:18.150
situations that's that's a claim and the
 

00:20:18.150 --> 00:20:19.250
situations that's that's a claim and the
second claim is that the most

00:20:19.250 --> 00:20:19.260
second claim is that the most

00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:21.450
psychologically impactful contingencies
 

00:20:21.450 --> 00:20:24.169
psychologically impactful contingencies
are those that threaten us those are the

00:20:24.169 --> 00:20:24.179
are those that threaten us those are the
 

00:20:24.179 --> 00:20:26.180
are those that threaten us those are the
two operating assumptions that I'm

00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:26.190
two operating assumptions that I'm
 

00:20:26.190 --> 00:20:28.549
two operating assumptions that I'm
making now I want to move into the

00:20:28.549 --> 00:20:28.559
making now I want to move into the
 

00:20:28.559 --> 00:20:30.770
making now I want to move into the
research the experiments that that

00:20:30.770 --> 00:20:30.780
research the experiments that that
 

00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:34.070
research the experiments that that
capture the test experiment of

00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:34.080
capture the test experiment of
 

00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:36.350
capture the test experiment of
stereotype threat because stereotype

00:20:36.350 --> 00:20:36.360
stereotype threat because stereotype

identity contingency it's a very subtle
 

00:20:40.770 --> 00:20:43.280
identity contingency it's a very subtle
identity contingency and so one that

00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:43.290
identity contingency and so one that
 

00:20:43.290 --> 00:20:45.169
identity contingency and so one that
might not be might be tempted to think

it's not very powerful but you'll see I

00:20:46.970 --> 00:20:46.980
it's not very powerful but you'll see I
 

00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:50.510
it's not very powerful but you'll see I
think that it can be quite powerful what

00:20:50.510 --> 00:20:50.520
think that it can be quite powerful what

stereotype about one of your identities
 

00:21:08.369 --> 00:21:09.710
stereotype about one of your identities
could be applied to you in that

00:21:09.710 --> 00:21:09.720
could be applied to you in that
 

00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:12.350

situation at that moment at some level
often implicit you have the realization

00:21:15.470 --> 00:21:15.480
often implicit you have the realization
 

00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:17.930
often implicit you have the realization
that you could be judged or treated in

00:21:17.930 --> 00:21:17.940
that you could be judged or treated in
 

00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:20.989
that you could be judged or treated in
terms of that stereotype and if you care

00:21:20.989 --> 00:21:20.999
terms of that stereotype and if you care
 

00:21:20.999 --> 00:21:22.549
terms of that stereotype and if you care
about what you're doing this is an

00:21:22.549 --> 00:21:22.559
about what you're doing this is an
 

00:21:22.559 --> 00:21:25.129
about what you're doing this is an
important point if you care about what

00:21:25.129 --> 00:21:25.139
important point if you care about what
 

00:21:25.139 --> 00:21:26.810
important point if you care about what
you're doing in that situation the

00:21:26.810 --> 00:21:26.820
you're doing in that situation the
 

00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:28.279
you're doing in that situation the
prospect of being snagit of lis

00:21:28.279 --> 00:21:28.289
prospect of being snagit of lis
 

00:21:28.289 --> 00:21:30.169
prospect of being snagit of lis
stereotype like that are reduced to a

00:21:30.169 --> 00:21:30.179
stereotype like that are reduced to a
 

00:21:30.179 --> 00:21:32.359
stereotype like that are reduced to a
stereotype can be upsetting and

00:21:32.359 --> 00:21:32.369
stereotype can be upsetting and
 

00:21:32.369 --> 00:21:35.210
stereotype can be upsetting and
distracting and can interfere with your

00:21:35.210 --> 00:21:35.220
distracting and can interfere with your
 

00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:37.430
distracting and can interfere with your
functioning in that situation that's

00:21:37.430 --> 00:21:37.440
functioning in that situation that's
 

00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:39.259
functioning in that situation that's
just that's the basic idea

00:21:39.259 --> 00:21:39.269
just that's the basic idea
 

00:21:39.269 --> 00:21:40.970
just that's the basic idea
as you can see stereotype threat is not

00:21:40.970 --> 00:21:40.980
as you can see stereotype threat is not
 

00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:43.190
as you can see stereotype threat is not
something that is a piece of a person's

00:21:43.190 --> 00:21:43.200
something that is a piece of a person's
 

00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:45.560
something that is a piece of a person's
personality it's a it's a person is a

00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:45.570
personality it's a it's a person is a
 

00:21:45.570 --> 00:21:47.539
personality it's a it's a person is a
part of the situation we realize it

00:21:47.539 --> 00:21:47.549
part of the situation we realize it
 

00:21:47.549 --> 00:21:49.700
part of the situation we realize it
because we know the culture we're in and

00:21:49.700 --> 00:21:49.710
because we know the culture we're in and
 

00:21:49.710 --> 00:21:51.680
because we know the culture we're in and
we know the stereotypes that are in it

00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:51.690
we know the stereotypes that are in it
 

00:21:51.690 --> 00:21:52.970
we know the stereotypes that are in it
and we know we're doing something that's

00:21:52.970 --> 00:21:52.980
and we know we're doing something that's
 

00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:55.190
and we know we're doing something that's
relevant to it and then we we know that

00:21:55.190 --> 00:21:55.200
relevant to it and then we we know that
 

00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:56.810
relevant to it and then we we know that
we could be judged that way or treated

00:21:56.810 --> 00:21:56.820
we could be judged that way or treated
 

00:21:56.820 --> 00:22:00.669
we could be judged that way or treated
that way that's where the threat arises

00:22:00.669 --> 00:22:00.679
that way that's where the threat arises
 

00:22:00.679 --> 00:22:04.519
that way that's where the threat arises
so aren't our idea was if could this be

00:22:04.519 --> 00:22:04.529
so aren't our idea was if could this be
 

00:22:04.529 --> 00:22:08.450
so aren't our idea was if could this be
a factor in this problem I mentioned at

00:22:08.450 --> 00:22:08.460
a factor in this problem I mentioned at
 

00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:09.919
a factor in this problem I mentioned at
the outset of the talk on the

00:22:09.919 --> 00:22:09.929
the outset of the talk on the
 

00:22:09.929 --> 00:22:13.190
the outset of the talk on the
underperformance on cognitive tests and

00:22:13.190 --> 00:22:13.200
underperformance on cognitive tests and
 

00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:16.039
underperformance on cognitive tests and
in academic situations our very first

00:22:16.039 --> 00:22:16.049
in academic situations our very first
 

00:22:16.049 --> 00:22:19.190
in academic situations our very first
experiment looked at this as an account

00:22:19.190 --> 00:22:19.200
experiment looked at this as an account
 

00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:21.590
experiment looked at this as an account
of why women might underperform on a

00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:21.600
of why women might underperform on a
 

00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:25.399
of why women might underperform on a
difficult math test so we did this as

00:22:25.399 --> 00:22:25.409
difficult math test so we did this as
 

00:22:25.409 --> 00:22:27.590
difficult math test so we did this as
years ago at the University of Michigan

00:22:27.590 --> 00:22:27.600
years ago at the University of Michigan
 

00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:31.789
years ago at the University of Michigan
a simple experiment we got men and women

00:22:31.789 --> 00:22:31.799
a simple experiment we got men and women
 

00:22:31.799 --> 00:22:33.919
a simple experiment we got men and women
who were really good at math and cared

00:22:33.919 --> 00:22:33.929
who were really good at math and cared
 

00:22:33.929 --> 00:22:35.359
who were really good at math and cared
an awful lot about math they were

00:22:35.359 --> 00:22:35.369
an awful lot about math they were
 

00:22:35.369 --> 00:22:38.570
an awful lot about math they were
invested in it as a as a career path for

college at this at this point they had
 

00:22:42.149 --> 00:22:45.080
college at this at this point they had
high scores high grades and and the like

00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:45.090
high scores high grades and and the like
 

00:22:45.090 --> 00:22:47.509
high scores high grades and and the like
we brought them into the laboratory one

00:22:47.509 --> 00:22:47.519
we brought them into the laboratory one
 

00:22:47.519 --> 00:22:49.549
we brought them into the laboratory one
at a time and gave them a really

00:22:49.549 --> 00:22:49.559
at a time and gave them a really
 

00:22:49.559 --> 00:22:51.200
at a time and gave them a really
difficult math test a half an hour

00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:51.210
difficult math test a half an hour
 

00:22:51.210 --> 00:22:53.359
difficult math test a half an hour
section of the Graduate Record exam you

00:22:53.359 --> 00:22:53.369
section of the Graduate Record exam you
 

00:22:53.369 --> 00:22:56.090
section of the Graduate Record exam you
take if you're a math major so really

00:22:56.090 --> 00:22:56.100
take if you're a math major so really
 

00:22:56.100 --> 00:22:57.739
take if you're a math major so really
not the quantitative section but the

00:22:57.739 --> 00:22:57.749
not the quantitative section but the
 

00:22:57.749 --> 00:23:02.210
not the quantitative section but the
math section of the the of the GRE our

idea was that for the women for women
 

00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:05.299
idea was that for the women for women
this would be a very different

this would be a very different
 

00:23:05.309 --> 00:23:07.489
this would be a very different
experience than it would be for the men

different contingencies of identity that
make the experience of taking a test

00:23:15.649 --> 00:23:15.659
make the experience of taking a test

a very different experience
 

00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:20.960
a very different experience
for them for them when they start to

stereotype of in this society let's call
 

00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:28.190
stereotype of in this society let's call
it the Larry Summers stereotype for for

lack of just a put a fine point on it
 

00:23:33.770 --> 00:23:37.640
lack of just a put a fine point on it
that stereotype rears its head and

00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:37.650
that stereotype rears its head and
 

00:23:37.650 --> 00:23:41.180
that stereotype rears its head and
becomes a plausible explanation of the

00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:41.190
becomes a plausible explanation of the
 

00:23:41.190 --> 00:23:42.980
becomes a plausible explanation of the
experience of the emotion of the

frustration that the person is having in
 

00:23:45.270 --> 00:23:47.180
frustration that the person is having in
that situation and remember these are

00:23:47.180 --> 00:23:47.190
that situation and remember these are
 

00:23:47.190 --> 00:23:49.340
that situation and remember these are
women who care about doing well at math

women who care about doing well at math
so the prospect of of even in this

00:23:51.770 --> 00:23:51.780
so the prospect of of even in this
 

00:23:51.780 --> 00:23:53.870
so the prospect of of even in this
situation privately there alone in a

situation privately there alone in a
 

00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:55.790
situation privately there alone in a
room taking a test but the prospect for

00:23:55.790 --> 00:23:55.800
room taking a test but the prospect for
 

00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:58.250
room taking a test but the prospect for
these women to confirm that kind of

relevant to race there's this

of that sort that can be a very

of that sort that can be a very
 

00:32:36.649 --> 00:32:40.119
of that sort that can be a very
upsetting prospect that can have effects

00:32:40.119 --> 00:32:40.129

on behaviors in fact it may lead people

to avoid having these kinds of

to avoid having these kinds of

interactions and that may be one of the

factors that makes these settings

00:32:47.979 --> 00:32:47.989
factors that makes these settings
 

00:32:47.989 --> 00:32:50.469
factors that makes these settings
difficult so we did a very simple

00:32:50.469 --> 00:32:50.479
difficult so we did a very simple

it as I described it we brought white

00:32:54.249 --> 00:32:54.259
it as I described it we brought white

the table the two other students in one
 

00:33:05.179 --> 00:33:07.029
the table the two other students in one
condition the two other students were

two white guys in another condition the
 

00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:10.829
two white guys in another condition the
two other students are two black guys

two other students are two black guys
 

00:33:10.839 --> 00:33:12.669
two other students are two black guys
and they're going to have the

00:33:12.669 --> 00:33:12.679
and they're going to have the
 

00:33:12.679 --> 00:33:14.589
and they're going to have the
conversation it turns out either about

00:33:14.589 --> 00:33:14.599
conversation it turns out either about
 

00:33:14.599 --> 00:33:16.209
conversation it turns out either about
love and relationships which apparently

00:33:16.209 --> 00:33:16.219
love and relationships which apparently

college students from pre-testing can
 

00:33:18.619 --> 00:33:20.889
college students from pre-testing can
talk to each other very easily about or

talk to each other very easily about or
 

00:33:20.899 --> 00:33:22.719
talk to each other very easily about or
they're going to have the conversation

they're going to have the conversation
 

00:33:22.729 --> 00:33:24.700
they're going to have the conversation
not about that but about racial

00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:24.710
not about that but about racial
 

00:33:24.710 --> 00:33:27.249
not about that but about racial
profiling so they're going to talk to

00:33:27.249 --> 00:33:27.259
profiling so they're going to talk to
 

00:33:27.259 --> 00:33:28.899
profiling so they're going to talk to
either two black guys or two white guys

00:33:28.899 --> 00:33:28.909
either two black guys or two white guys
 

00:33:28.909 --> 00:33:30.249

okay I'm going to get up I'm going to go

okay I'm going to get up I'm going to go
get your two conversation partners and

00:33:37.810 --> 00:33:37.820
get your two conversation partners and
 

00:33:37.820 --> 00:33:39.249
get your two conversation partners and
bring them back and by the way while I'm

00:33:39.249 --> 00:33:39.259
bring them back and by the way while I'm
 

00:33:39.259 --> 00:33:41.109
bring them back and by the way while I'm
gone would you arrange the chairs for

00:33:41.109 --> 00:33:41.119
gone would you arrange the chairs for
 

00:33:41.119 --> 00:33:44.289
gone would you arrange the chairs for
the conversation over here and as soon

conversation and you can might imagine
 

00:33:47.570 --> 00:33:50.499
conversation and you can might imagine
the experiments over that's that's what

the experiments over that's that's what
 

00:33:50.509 --> 00:33:52.509
the experiments over that's that's what
we're looking for how do they space

we're looking for how do they space
 

00:33:52.519 --> 00:33:54.729
we're looking for how do they space
themselves in relation to each other

for this interview to happen and while
the interview is is while they're

00:41:48.010 --> 00:41:48.020
the interview is is while they're
 

00:41:48.020 --> 00:41:50.800
the interview is is while they're
waiting we show them videotapes in one

00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:50.810
waiting we show them videotapes in one
 

00:41:50.810 --> 00:41:54.580
waiting we show them videotapes in one
condition the videotape shows it shows

00:41:54.580 --> 00:41:54.590
condition the videotape shows it shows
 

00:41:54.590 --> 00:41:56.290

pictures of the workshop that they're

00:41:56.290 --> 00:41:56.300
pictures of the workshop that they're
 

00:41:56.300 --> 00:41:58.300
pictures of the workshop that they're
that they're interviewing for and in one

00:41:58.300 --> 00:41:58.310
that they're interviewing for and in one
 

00:41:58.310 --> 00:42:00.550
that they're interviewing for and in one
of the videos there is a one to one

00:42:00.550 --> 00:42:00.560
of the videos there is a one to one
 

00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:03.490
of the videos there is a one to one
ratio of men to women for every woman

00:42:03.490 --> 00:42:03.500
ratio of men to women for every woman
 

00:42:03.500 --> 00:42:05.920
ratio of men to women for every woman
there's a man in the other video for the

00:42:05.920 --> 00:42:05.930
there's a man in the other video for the
 

00:42:05.930 --> 00:42:07.720
there's a man in the other video for the
other set of subjects it's a three to

00:42:07.720 --> 00:42:07.730
other set of subjects it's a three to
 

00:42:07.730 --> 00:42:10.720
other set of subjects it's a three to
one ratio three men for every women for

00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:10.730
one ratio three men for every women for
 

00:42:10.730 --> 00:42:13.380
one ratio three men for every women for
every woman that's all there is to this

00:42:13.380 --> 00:42:13.390
every woman that's all there is to this
 

00:42:13.390 --> 00:42:16.150
every woman that's all there is to this
experiment that's all there is just what

00:42:16.150 --> 00:42:16.160
experiment that's all there is just what
 

00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:19.150
experiment that's all there is just what
if I don't know if I have these pictures

00:42:19.150 --> 00:42:19.160
if I don't know if I have these pictures
 

00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:23.230
if I don't know if I have these pictures
here yeah there they are I like to show

00:42:23.230 --> 00:42:23.240
here yeah there they are I like to show
 

00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:26.170
here yeah there they are I like to show
them because when you look at them you

00:42:26.170 --> 00:42:26.180
them because when you look at them you
 

00:42:26.180 --> 00:42:27.850
them because when you look at them you
got to look twice to see this it isn't

00:42:27.850 --> 00:42:27.860
got to look twice to see this it isn't
 

00:42:27.860 --> 00:42:31.060
got to look twice to see this it isn't
it is not a big cue it's it's a

00:42:31.060 --> 00:42:31.070
it is not a big cue it's it's a
 

00:42:31.070 --> 00:42:33.100
it is not a big cue it's it's a
relatively subtle cue you can see it but

00:42:33.100 --> 00:42:33.110
relatively subtle cue you can see it but
 

00:42:33.110 --> 00:42:37.240
relatively subtle cue you can see it but
you have to kind of pay attention okay

00:42:37.240 --> 00:42:37.250
you have to kind of pay attention okay
 

00:42:37.250 --> 00:42:38.890
you have to kind of pay attention okay
here's what happened in this experiment

00:42:38.890 --> 00:42:38.900
here's what happened in this experiment
 

00:42:38.900 --> 00:42:40.570
here's what happened in this experiment
these these are the results and this is

00:42:40.570 --> 00:42:40.580
these these are the results and this is
 

00:42:40.580 --> 00:42:42.220
these these are the results and this is
always going to be the critical cell to

00:42:42.220 --> 00:42:42.230
always going to be the critical cell to
 

00:42:42.230 --> 00:42:45.580
always going to be the critical cell to
look at these are women who saw the

00:42:45.580 --> 00:42:45.590
look at these are women who saw the
 

00:42:45.590 --> 00:42:50.170
look at these are women who saw the
three-to-one ratio of of men to women

00:42:50.170 --> 00:42:50.180
three-to-one ratio of of men to women
 

00:42:50.180 --> 00:42:52.570
three-to-one ratio of of men to women
that's the that's what they saw so these

00:42:52.570 --> 00:42:52.580
that's the that's what they saw so these
 

00:42:52.580 --> 00:42:54.340
that's the that's what they saw so these
are women who saw looked at this

00:42:54.340 --> 00:42:54.350
are women who saw looked at this
 

00:42:54.350 --> 00:42:57.040
are women who saw looked at this
workshop and saw relatively few women in

00:42:57.040 --> 00:42:57.050
workshop and saw relatively few women in
 

00:42:57.050 --> 00:42:59.410
workshop and saw relatively few women in
it that was the cue well when that

00:42:59.410 --> 00:42:59.420
it that was the cue well when that
 

00:42:59.420 --> 00:43:02.800
it that was the cue well when that
happens interestingly they remember more

00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:02.810
happens interestingly they remember more
 

00:43:02.810 --> 00:43:06.610
happens interestingly they remember more
details of both the experimental room

00:43:06.610 --> 00:43:06.620
details of both the experimental room
 

00:43:06.620 --> 00:43:10.390
details of both the experimental room
and incidental details of the videotape

00:43:10.390 --> 00:43:10.400
and incidental details of the videotape
 

00:43:10.400 --> 00:43:13.390
and incidental details of the videotape
they remember more of the details that

00:43:13.390 --> 00:43:13.400
they remember more of the details that
 

00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:15.610
they remember more of the details that
tells us that what they're doing in that

00:43:15.610 --> 00:43:15.620
tells us that what they're doing in that
 

00:43:15.620 --> 00:43:17.800
tells us that what they're doing in that
situation is paying attention to the

00:43:17.800 --> 00:43:17.810
situation is paying attention to the
 

00:43:17.810 --> 00:43:20.230
situation is paying attention to the
circumstances to the condition that cue

00:43:20.230 --> 00:43:20.240
circumstances to the condition that cue
 

00:43:20.240 --> 00:43:22.690
circumstances to the condition that cue
has made them vigilant to whether or not

00:43:22.690 --> 00:43:22.700
has made them vigilant to whether or not
 

00:43:22.700 --> 00:43:24.670
has made them vigilant to whether or not
there are features of this workshop that

00:43:24.670 --> 00:43:24.680
there are features of this workshop that
 

00:43:24.680 --> 00:43:27.730
there are features of this workshop that
might be kind of identity vanity issues

00:43:27.730 --> 00:43:27.740
might be kind of identity vanity issues
 

00:43:27.740 --> 00:43:32.200
might be kind of identity vanity issues
and just that ratio makes provokes that

00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:32.210
and just that ratio makes provokes that
 

00:43:32.210 --> 00:43:33.760
and just that ratio makes provokes that
and they start to pay attention to those

00:43:33.760 --> 00:43:33.770
and they start to pay attention to those
 

00:43:33.770 --> 00:43:35.140
and they start to pay attention to those
things and so they remember them better

00:43:35.140 --> 00:43:35.150
things and so they remember them better
 

00:43:35.150 --> 00:43:37.330
things and so they remember them better
think about being the only man in the

00:43:37.330 --> 00:43:37.340
think about being the only man in the
 

00:43:37.340 --> 00:43:38.890
think about being the only man in the
room or the only woman in the room if

00:43:38.890 --> 00:43:38.900
room or the only woman in the room if
 

00:43:38.900 --> 00:43:40.000
room or the only woman in the room if
you're the only man in the room you

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:40.010
you're the only man in the room you
 

00:43:40.010 --> 00:43:41.320
you're the only man in the room you
start to pay attention you start to

00:43:41.320 --> 00:43:41.330
start to pay attention you start to
 

00:43:41.330 --> 00:43:42.730
start to pay attention you start to
count how many other men are there

00:43:42.730 --> 00:43:42.740
count how many other men are there
 

00:43:42.740 --> 00:43:44.200
count how many other men are there
what's what are they doing where are

00:43:44.200 --> 00:43:44.210
what's what are they doing where are
 

00:43:44.210 --> 00:43:46.240
what's what are they doing where are
they why aren't they here what's the why

00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:46.250
they why aren't they here what's the why
 

00:43:46.250 --> 00:43:49.660

am I here why did the the the just that

00:43:49.660 --> 00:43:49.670
am I here why did the the the just that
 

00:43:49.670 --> 00:43:51.400
am I here why did the the the just that
kind of processing just starts to happen

00:43:51.400 --> 00:43:51.410
kind of processing just starts to happen
 

00:43:51.410 --> 00:43:53.770
kind of processing just starts to happen
and this and this just reflects that

00:43:53.770 --> 00:43:53.780
and this and this just reflects that
 

00:43:53.780 --> 00:43:57.010

this is just a another memory measure of

00:43:57.010 --> 00:43:57.020
this is just a another memory measure of
 

00:43:57.020 --> 00:44:00.430
this is just a another memory measure of
the same of the same kind of thing this

00:44:00.430 --> 00:44:00.440
the same of the same kind of thing this
 

00:44:00.440 --> 00:44:02.320
the same of the same kind of thing this
is cardiovascular reactivity which I

00:44:02.320 --> 00:44:02.330
is cardiovascular reactivity which I
 

00:44:02.330 --> 00:44:04.390
is cardiovascular reactivity which I
which I think is amazing to me but look

00:44:04.390 --> 00:44:04.400
which I think is amazing to me but look
 

00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:06.160
which I think is amazing to me but look
how much more reactive kardia this is

00:44:06.160 --> 00:44:06.170
how much more reactive kardia this is
 

00:44:06.170 --> 00:44:08.260
how much more reactive kardia this is
this is sort of a combination of of

00:44:08.260 --> 00:44:08.270
this is sort of a combination of of
 

00:44:08.270 --> 00:44:10.300
this is sort of a combination of of
measures of cardio vascular reactivity

00:44:10.300 --> 00:44:10.310
measures of cardio vascular reactivity
 

00:44:10.310 --> 00:44:12.160
measures of cardio vascular reactivity

pulse and blood pressure and the like
 

00:44:12.170 --> 00:44:13.720
pulse and blood pressure and the like
and look how much more reactive they are

00:44:13.720 --> 00:44:13.730
and look how much more reactive they are
 

00:44:13.730 --> 00:44:16.240
and look how much more reactive they are
than the women and the participants in

now I want to stress here you you can

00:45:01.120 --> 00:45:01.130
now I want to stress here you you can
 

00:45:01.130 --> 00:45:03.550
now I want to stress here you you can
see that this identity a threat arises

00:45:03.550 --> 00:45:03.560
see that this identity a threat arises
 

00:45:03.560 --> 00:45:06.070
see that this identity a threat arises
out of the way a situation is organized

00:45:06.070 --> 00:45:06.080
out of the way a situation is organized
 

00:45:06.080 --> 00:45:08.230
out of the way a situation is organized
around identity which arises out of the

around identity which arises out of the
 

00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:10.270
around identity which arises out of the
history of this society which arises out

history of this society which arises out
 

00:45:10.280 --> 00:45:13.090
history of this society which arises out
of the continuing differences of

00:45:13.090 --> 00:45:13.100
of the continuing differences of
 

00:45:13.100 --> 00:45:15.130
of the continuing differences of
experience in this society based on

experience in this society based on
group identity and it arises out of all

group identity and it arises out of all
 

00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:18.500
group identity and it arises out of all
those things a very

00:45:18.500 --> 00:45:18.510
those things a very
 

00:45:18.510 --> 00:45:21.230
those things a very
velika no the big picture produces these

00:45:21.230 --> 00:45:21.240
velika no the big picture produces these
 

00:45:21.240 --> 00:45:22.760
velika no the big picture produces these
things we're talking about how it's

00:45:22.760 --> 00:45:22.770
things we're talking about how it's
 

00:45:22.770 --> 00:45:25.640
things we're talking about how it's
experienced by the individual but I'm

00:45:25.640 --> 00:45:25.650
experienced by the individual but I'm
 

00:45:25.650 --> 00:45:27.650
experienced by the individual but I'm
arguing that for all of those reasons we

but I think maybe I should stop at this
 

00:58:13.580 --> 00:58:15.010
but I think maybe I should stop at this
point and allow people to have some

00:58:15.010 --> 00:58:15.020
point and allow people to have some
 

00:58:15.020 --> 00:58:33.949

a Provost that you better be careful
 

00:58:45.159 --> 00:58:48.209
a Provost that you better be careful
around because he's going to understand

00:58:48.209 --> 00:58:48.219
around because he's going to understand
 

00:58:48.219 --> 00:58:50.009
around because he's going to understand
you better than you understand yourself

00:58:50.009 --> 00:58:50.019
you better than you understand yourself
 

00:58:50.019 --> 00:58:54.659
you better than you understand yourself
and that's a dangerous thing we have any

00:58:54.659 --> 00:58:54.669
and that's a dangerous thing we have any
 

00:58:54.669 --> 00:59:06.209
and that's a dangerous thing we have any
questions yeah you bet Provost what do

00:59:06.209 --> 00:59:06.219
questions yeah you bet Provost what do
 

00:59:06.219 --> 00:59:07.949
questions yeah you bet Provost what do
you say about those situations in which

00:59:07.949 --> 00:59:07.959
you say about those situations in which
 

00:59:07.959 --> 00:59:10.549
you say about those situations in which
the threatening cues are actually

00:59:10.549 --> 00:59:10.559
the threatening cues are actually
 

00:59:10.559 --> 00:59:13.199
the threatening cues are actually
reinforced sometimes by the group with

00:59:13.199 --> 00:59:13.209
reinforced sometimes by the group with
 

00:59:13.209 --> 00:59:16.559
reinforced sometimes by the group with
the identity in question so women who

00:59:16.559 --> 00:59:16.569
the identity in question so women who
 

00:59:16.569 --> 00:59:18.539
the identity in question so women who
will raise their daughters telling them

00:59:18.539 --> 00:59:18.549
will raise their daughters telling them
 

00:59:18.549 --> 00:59:20.429

that don't worry about your grade in

00:59:20.429 --> 00:59:20.439
that don't worry about your grade in
 

00:59:20.439 --> 00:59:21.870
that don't worry about your grade in
math because women aren't any good at

00:59:21.870 --> 00:59:21.880
math because women aren't any good at
 

00:59:21.880 --> 00:59:25.289
math because women aren't any good at
math anyway or in black communities

00:59:25.289 --> 00:59:25.299
math anyway or in black communities
 

00:59:25.299 --> 00:59:28.199

sometimes particularly in elementary

00:59:28.199 --> 00:59:28.209
sometimes particularly in elementary
 

00:59:28.209 --> 00:59:31.169
sometimes particularly in elementary
schools of the early years where

00:59:31.169 --> 00:59:31.179
schools of the early years where
 

00:59:31.179 --> 00:59:34.019
schools of the early years where
sometimes there is a an idea a foot that

00:59:34.019 --> 00:59:34.029
sometimes there is a an idea a foot that

somehow academic success is acting white

00:59:37.669 --> 00:59:37.679
somehow academic success is acting white
 

00:59:37.679 --> 00:59:39.959
somehow academic success is acting white
so I just throw that out there how do

00:59:39.959 --> 00:59:39.969
so I just throw that out there how do
 

00:59:39.969 --> 00:59:42.439
so I just throw that out there how do
you what what are some of the remedies

00:59:42.439 --> 00:59:42.449
you what what are some of the remedies
 

00:59:42.449 --> 00:59:45.779
you what what are some of the remedies
for the situation that results when it's

00:59:45.779 --> 00:59:45.789
for the situation that results when it's
 

00:59:45.789 --> 00:59:47.789
for the situation that results when it's
coming from the group itself that the

00:59:47.789 --> 00:59:47.799
coming from the group itself that the
 

00:59:47.799 --> 00:59:50.939
coming from the group itself that the
the acceptance of the threatening q yeah

00:59:50.939 --> 00:59:50.949
the acceptance of the threatening q yeah
 

00:59:50.949 --> 00:59:52.319
the acceptance of the threatening q yeah
I think you raise an important point

00:59:52.319 --> 00:59:52.329
I think you raise an important point
 

00:59:52.329 --> 00:59:54.179
I think you raise an important point
because that when it's coming from the

00:59:54.179 --> 00:59:54.189
because that when it's coming from the
 

00:59:54.189 --> 00:59:57.479
because that when it's coming from the
group itself it can be more insidious

00:59:57.479 --> 00:59:57.489
group itself it can be more insidious
 

00:59:57.489 --> 01:00:01.229
group itself it can be more insidious
and and difficult to to recognize for

01:00:01.229 --> 01:00:01.239
and and difficult to to recognize for
 

01:00:01.239 --> 01:00:04.769
and and difficult to to recognize for
what it is and and maybe be more more

01:00:04.769 --> 01:00:04.779
what it is and and maybe be more more
 

01:00:04.779 --> 01:00:07.319
what it is and and maybe be more more
threatening there so you know I I don't

01:00:07.319 --> 01:00:07.329
threatening there so you know I I don't
 

01:00:07.329 --> 01:00:13.169
threatening there so you know I I don't
know I other than to try to make people

01:00:13.169 --> 01:00:13.179
know I other than to try to make people
 

01:00:13.179 --> 01:00:15.179
know I other than to try to make people
aware of how costly those kind of

01:00:15.179 --> 01:00:15.189
aware of how costly those kind of
 

01:00:15.189 --> 01:00:17.639
aware of how costly those kind of
remarks can be how much impact it that

segregated schools and usually I do get

01:00:53.690 --> 01:00:53.700
segregated schools and usually I do get
 

01:00:53.700 --> 01:00:56.210

segregated settings and I think I think

01:01:06.650 --> 01:01:06.660
segregated settings and I think I think
 

01:01:06.660 --> 01:01:09.710
segregated settings and I think I think
I have to admit that they are stronger

01:01:09.710 --> 01:01:09.720
I have to admit that they are stronger

things I answered two questions there
 

01:02:03.740 --> 01:02:07.070
things I answered two questions there
yeah I was just wondering if you could

01:02:07.070 --> 01:02:07.080
yeah I was just wondering if you could
 

01:02:07.080 --> 01:02:08.990
yeah I was just wondering if you could
explain why in some of the experiments

01:02:08.990 --> 01:02:09.000
explain why in some of the experiments
 

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.540
explain why in some of the experiments
where they were gender or color neutral

01:02:11.540 --> 01:02:11.550
where they were gender or color neutral
 

01:02:11.550 --> 01:02:14.120
where they were gender or color neutral
in the way in which the situation was

01:02:14.120 --> 01:02:14.130
in the way in which the situation was
 

01:02:14.130 --> 01:02:17.480
in the way in which the situation was
presented the the woman's performance

01:02:17.480 --> 01:02:17.490
presented the the woman's performance
 

01:02:17.490 --> 01:02:19.370
presented the the woman's performance
and the black performance went up but

01:02:19.370 --> 01:02:19.380
and the black performance went up but
 

01:02:19.380 --> 01:02:20.990
and the black performance went up but
the male performance and the white

01:02:20.990 --> 01:02:21.000
the male performance and the white
 

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.950
the male performance and the white
performance appeared to go down yeah

01:02:23.950 --> 01:02:23.960
performance appeared to go down yeah
 

01:02:23.960 --> 01:02:26.800
performance appeared to go down yeah
that has gotten to be a well-known

01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:26.810
that has gotten to be a well-known
 

01:02:26.810 --> 01:02:28.850
that has gotten to be a well-known

01:02:28.850 --> 01:02:28.860
phenomenon called
 

01:02:28.860 --> 01:02:33.170
phenomenon called
stereotyping lift and the idea is that

01:02:33.170 --> 01:02:33.180
stereotyping lift and the idea is that
 

01:02:33.180 --> 01:02:37.610
stereotyping lift and the idea is that
it's it's slightly advantageous to be on

01:02:37.610 --> 01:02:37.620
it's it's slightly advantageous to be on
 

01:02:37.620 --> 01:02:39.980
it's it's slightly advantageous to be on

works I'm not sure that exactly how it

01:02:46.070 --> 01:02:46.080
works I'm not sure that exactly how it
 

01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:48.290
works I'm not sure that exactly how it
works has been worked out in research

01:02:48.290 --> 01:02:48.300
works has been worked out in research
 

01:02:48.300 --> 01:02:49.990

yet but

01:02:49.990 --> 01:02:50.000
yet but

if I'm in the group well I do use the

if I'm in the group well I do use the
 

01:02:52.490 --> 01:02:54.280
if I'm in the group well I do use the
example of being african-american and

01:02:54.280 --> 01:02:54.290
example of being african-american and
 

01:02:54.290 --> 01:02:58.000

hardly ever discouraged me from from

in the in that setting and not really

read it as me being inappropriate to the

maybe I'm just not so good at math then
and that's that's sort of an example of

and that's that's sort of an example of
 

01:04:04.700 --> 01:04:07.570
and that's that's sort of an example of
how just the overall stereotype

then you start to see the cumulative

01:04:30.460 --> 01:04:30.470
then you start to see the cumulative
 

01:04:30.470 --> 01:04:32.290
then you start to see the cumulative
effects of that over the course of a

01:04:32.290 --> 01:04:32.300
effects of that over the course of a
 

01:04:32.300 --> 01:04:34.240

start with that with with that fact but

01:06:10.900 --> 01:06:10.910
start with that with with that fact but
 

01:06:10.910 --> 01:06:15.790
start with that with with that fact but
I don't it's very important to accept I

and as you point out there is some

01:06:23.770 --> 01:06:23.780
and as you point out there is some
 

01:06:23.780 --> 01:06:26.980

so I feel pretty strongly about it and I
 

01:07:18.640 --> 01:07:20.160
so I feel pretty strongly about it and I
won't wanted to know like if there was

won't wanted to know like if there was
any research done on that like what kind

you're talking about so all I could do
 

01:07:46.750 --> 01:07:48.780
you're talking about so all I could do
is sort of fall back on general

01:07:48.780 --> 01:07:48.790
is sort of fall back on general
 

01:07:48.790 --> 01:07:53.670
is sort of fall back on general
principle and it it's what can I say

01:07:53.670 --> 01:07:53.680
principle and it it's what can I say
 

01:07:53.680 --> 01:07:54.930
principle and it it's what can I say
it's not a good experience to be

01:07:54.930 --> 01:07:54.940
it's not a good experience to be
 

01:07:54.940 --> 01:07:56.760
it's not a good experience to be
negatively stereotyped in in those ways

negatively stereotyped in in those ways
 

01:07:56.770 --> 01:07:58.680
negatively stereotyped in in those ways
and it's going to cause a lot of the

and it's going to cause a lot of the
 

01:07:58.690 --> 01:08:01.590
and it's going to cause a lot of the
kind of effects that you that you see

kind of effects that you that you see
 

01:08:01.600 --> 01:08:04.290
kind of effects that you that you see
documented in in this research it may

its effects on those kinds of behaviors

but if but other stereotypes have other

allegations inherent in them and that's
 

01:08:19.270 --> 01:08:20.820
allegations inherent in them and that's
where you would look to see the

01:08:20.820 --> 01:08:20.830
where you would look to see the
 

01:08:20.830 --> 01:08:24.120
where you would look to see the
consequences of that kind of negative

consequences of that kind of negative
 

01:08:24.130 --> 01:08:26.190
consequences of that kind of negative
negative stereotyping I'm sure that

01:08:26.190 --> 01:08:26.200
negative stereotyping I'm sure that
 

01:08:26.200 --> 01:08:29.579
negative stereotyping I'm sure that
doesn't begin to answer the question you

01:08:29.579 --> 01:08:29.589
doesn't begin to answer the question you
 

01:08:29.589 --> 01:08:31.289
doesn't begin to answer the question you
you have but that would take a lot

01:08:31.289 --> 01:08:31.299
you have but that would take a lot
 

01:08:31.299 --> 01:08:36.000
you have but that would take a lot
longer discussion to to do that good

the results and they're very intriguing
 

01:08:43.930 --> 01:08:46.440
the results and they're very intriguing
I had not read the original papers I

01:08:46.440 --> 01:08:46.450
I had not read the original papers I
 

01:08:46.450 --> 01:08:48.210
I had not read the original papers I
noticed that the the last set of

01:08:48.210 --> 01:08:48.220
noticed that the the last set of
 

01:08:48.220 --> 01:08:51.120
noticed that the the last set of
histograms you showed had error bars I

01:08:51.120 --> 01:08:51.130
histograms you showed had error bars I
 

01:08:51.130 --> 01:08:53.250
histograms you showed had error bars I
presume standard errors in them it was

01:08:53.250 --> 01:08:53.260
presume standard errors in them it was
 

01:08:53.260 --> 01:08:54.960
presume standard errors in them it was
interesting that the first all the

01:08:54.960 --> 01:08:54.970
interesting that the first all the
 

01:08:54.970 --> 01:08:57.180
interesting that the first all the
initial data you showed cut histograms

01:08:57.180 --> 01:08:57.190
initial data you showed cut histograms
 

01:08:57.190 --> 01:09:00.660
initial data you showed cut histograms
with nonzero origins and where there

01:09:00.660 --> 01:09:00.670
with nonzero origins and where there
 

01:09:00.670 --> 01:09:02.370
with nonzero origins and where there
were no error bar shown at all so it was

01:09:02.370 --> 01:09:02.380
were no error bar shown at all so it was
 

01:09:02.380 --> 01:09:03.809
were no error bar shown at all so it was
a little bit hard without knowing the

01:09:03.809 --> 01:09:03.819
a little bit hard without knowing the
 

01:09:03.819 --> 01:09:06.960
a little bit hard without knowing the
papers to assess just how significant

01:09:06.960 --> 01:09:06.970
papers to assess just how significant
 

01:09:06.970 --> 01:09:08.430
papers to assess just how significant
the differences were between the various

01:09:08.430 --> 01:09:08.440
the differences were between the various
 

01:09:08.440 --> 01:09:11.579
the differences were between the various
groups hmm well most meta-analysis I

01:09:11.579 --> 01:09:11.589
groups hmm well most meta-analysis I
 

01:09:11.589 --> 01:09:13.170
groups hmm well most meta-analysis I
would say that the average stereotyped

01:09:13.170 --> 01:09:13.180
would say that the average stereotyped
 

01:09:13.180 --> 01:09:14.820
would say that the average stereotyped
artifact is about six points

01:09:14.820 --> 01:09:14.830
artifact is about six points
 

01:09:14.830 --> 01:09:17.160
artifact is about six points
the standard deviation this would be

01:09:17.160 --> 01:09:17.170
the standard deviation this would be
 

01:09:17.170 --> 01:09:24.360
the standard deviation this would be
over 1500 studies it's become a huge it

01:09:24.360 --> 01:09:24.370
over 1500 studies it's become a huge it
 

01:09:24.370 --> 01:09:26.250
over 1500 studies it's become a huge it
was a cottage industry for a long time

01:09:26.250 --> 01:09:26.260
was a cottage industry for a long time
 

01:09:26.260 --> 01:09:30.599
was a cottage industry for a long time
it still is so I apologize for those

01:09:30.599 --> 01:09:30.609
it still is so I apologize for those
 

01:09:30.609 --> 01:09:33.480
it still is so I apologize for those
features of those those histograms but

01:09:33.480 --> 01:09:33.490
features of those those histograms but
 

01:09:33.490 --> 01:09:35.760
features of those those histograms but
the that's what I think you can sort of

01:09:35.760 --> 01:09:35.770
the that's what I think you can sort of
 

01:09:35.770 --> 01:09:36.540
the that's what I think you can sort of
take to the bank

01:09:36.540 --> 01:09:36.550
take to the bank
 

01:09:36.550 --> 01:09:38.670
take to the bank
as the site as the general size of that

01:09:38.670 --> 01:09:38.680
as the site as the general size of that
 

01:09:38.680 --> 01:09:42.180

of that effect again the effect can be

01:09:42.180 --> 01:09:42.190
of that effect again the effect can be
 

01:09:42.190 --> 01:09:45.150
of that effect again the effect can be
made stronger a lot stronger if you're

01:09:45.150 --> 01:09:45.160
made stronger a lot stronger if you're
 

01:09:45.160 --> 01:09:47.310
made stronger a lot stronger if you're
in a situation where there are where the

in a situation where there are where the
 

01:09:47.320 --> 01:09:49.410
in a situation where there are where the
queues start to mount up and it can be

01:09:49.410 --> 01:09:49.420

contingency are reduced in in a
 

01:09:56.860 --> 01:09:59.310
contingency are reduced in in a
situation but over all of the studies

01:09:59.310 --> 01:09:59.320
situation but over all of the studies
 

01:09:59.320 --> 01:10:00.690

that have been done if we just use that

01:10:00.690 --> 01:10:00.700
that have been done if we just use that
 

01:10:00.700 --> 01:10:02.580
that have been done if we just use that
as an indicator that's about the size of

01:10:02.580 --> 01:10:02.590
as an indicator that's about the size of
 

01:10:02.590 --> 01:10:05.430
as an indicator that's about the size of
the effects we have two more people

01:10:05.430 --> 01:10:05.440
the effects we have two more people
 

01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:07.830
the effects we have two more people
standing for questions let's take both

01:10:07.830 --> 01:10:07.840
standing for questions let's take both
 

01:10:07.840 --> 01:10:09.270
standing for questions let's take both
of those questions and then we'll

01:10:09.270 --> 01:10:09.280
of those questions and then we'll
 

01:10:09.280 --> 01:10:14.100
of those questions and then we'll
conclude there's a reception following I

01:10:14.100 --> 01:10:14.110
conclude there's a reception following I
 

01:10:14.110 --> 01:10:16.910
conclude there's a reception following I
have a question about I guess the way

01:10:16.910 --> 01:10:16.920
have a question about I guess the way
 

01:10:16.920 --> 01:10:18.990
have a question about I guess the way
these studies we look at kind of

01:10:18.990 --> 01:10:19.000
these studies we look at kind of
 

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:20.490
these studies we look at kind of
discrete act aspects of identity

01:10:20.490 --> 01:10:20.500
discrete act aspects of identity
 

01:10:20.500 --> 01:10:22.680
discrete act aspects of identity
intelligence and in the athletic studies

01:10:22.680 --> 01:10:22.690
intelligence and in the athletic studies
 

01:10:22.690 --> 01:10:24.210
intelligence and in the athletic studies
they've done you know looking at

01:10:24.210 --> 01:10:24.220
they've done you know looking at
 

01:10:24.220 --> 01:10:26.700
they've done you know looking at
athletics discretely I wonder if those

01:10:26.700 --> 01:10:26.710
athletics discretely I wonder if those
 

01:10:26.710 --> 01:10:29.210
athletics discretely I wonder if those
discrete aspects are kind of

01:10:29.210 --> 01:10:29.220
discrete aspects are kind of
 

01:10:29.220 --> 01:10:31.290
discrete aspects are kind of
amalgamating to one for instance if you

01:10:31.290 --> 01:10:31.300
amalgamating to one for instance if you
 

01:10:31.300 --> 01:10:32.880
amalgamating to one for instance if you
ask a black student about athletic

01:10:32.880 --> 01:10:32.890
ask a black student about athletic
 

01:10:32.890 --> 01:10:34.290
ask a black student about athletic
ability does that then have a

01:10:34.290 --> 01:10:34.300
ability does that then have a
 

01:10:34.300 --> 01:10:36.090
ability does that then have a
ramification in terms of tests of

01:10:36.090 --> 01:10:36.100
ramification in terms of tests of
 

01:10:36.100 --> 01:10:37.770
ramification in terms of tests of
intelligence in other words do they see

01:10:37.770 --> 01:10:37.780
intelligence in other words do they see
 

01:10:37.780 --> 01:10:40.680
intelligence in other words do they see
the identity as a complete construct of

01:10:40.680 --> 01:10:40.690
the identity as a complete construct of
 

01:10:40.690 --> 01:10:41.850
the identity as a complete construct of
their psychic ability or their

01:10:41.850 --> 01:10:41.860
their psychic ability or their
 

01:10:41.860 --> 01:10:44.010
their psychic ability or their
intelligence their emotional kind of

01:10:44.010 --> 01:10:44.020
intelligence their emotional kind of
 

01:10:44.020 --> 01:10:45.570
intelligence their emotional kind of
capabilities or do they kind of look at

01:10:45.570 --> 01:10:45.580
capabilities or do they kind of look at
 

01:10:45.580 --> 01:10:47.010
capabilities or do they kind of look at
it just greatly is that with the data

01:10:47.010 --> 01:10:47.020
it just greatly is that with the data
 

01:10:47.020 --> 01:10:49.740
it just greatly is that with the data
show yeah I think the the right way to

01:10:49.740 --> 01:10:49.750
show yeah I think the the right way to
 

01:10:49.750 --> 01:10:52.170
show yeah I think the the right way to
interpret that is that it depends on

01:10:52.170 --> 01:10:52.180
interpret that is that it depends on
 

01:10:52.180 --> 01:10:53.940
interpret that is that it depends on
which which stereotype and which

01:10:53.940 --> 01:10:53.950
which which stereotype and which
 

01:10:53.950 --> 01:10:56.070
which which stereotype and which
identity are the most salient to the

01:10:56.070 --> 01:10:56.080
identity are the most salient to the
 

01:10:56.080 --> 01:10:58.590
identity are the most salient to the
person I can give you an example in

01:10:58.590 --> 01:10:58.600
person I can give you an example in
 

01:10:58.600 --> 01:11:00.840
person I can give you an example in
terms of a study on athletics this is

01:11:00.840 --> 01:11:00.850
terms of a study on athletics this is
 

01:11:00.850 --> 01:11:02.490
terms of a study on athletics this is
these are elite athletes at the

01:11:02.490 --> 01:11:02.500
these are elite athletes at the
 

01:11:02.500 --> 01:11:04.500
these are elite athletes at the
University of Arizona you know that

01:11:04.500 --> 01:11:04.510
University of Arizona you know that
 

01:11:04.510 --> 01:11:07.920
University of Arizona you know that
study and they're about to perform a

01:11:07.920 --> 01:11:07.930
study and they're about to perform a
 

01:11:07.930 --> 01:11:10.770
study and they're about to perform a
golf task and in one condition they're

01:11:10.770 --> 01:11:10.780
golf task and in one condition they're
 

01:11:10.780 --> 01:11:12.480
golf task and in one condition they're
told these are white and black athletes

01:11:12.480 --> 01:11:12.490
told these are white and black athletes
 

01:11:12.490 --> 01:11:15.870
told these are white and black athletes
they're told this is a task of natural

01:11:15.870 --> 01:11:15.880
they're told this is a task of natural
 

01:11:15.880 --> 01:11:18.060
they're told this is a task of natural
athletic ability do the best you can

01:11:18.060 --> 01:11:18.070
athletic ability do the best you can
 

01:11:18.070 --> 01:11:22.440
athletic ability do the best you can
under that stereotype the white athletes

01:11:22.440 --> 01:11:22.450
under that stereotype the white athletes
 

01:11:22.450 --> 01:11:24.750
under that stereotype the white athletes
go in and underperform in relation to

01:11:24.750 --> 01:11:24.760
go in and underperform in relation to
 

01:11:24.760 --> 01:11:25.479
go in and underperform in relation to
the black

01:11:25.479 --> 01:11:25.489
the black
 

01:11:25.489 --> 01:11:28.359
the black
we all know that kind of stereotyping in

01:11:28.359 --> 01:11:28.369
we all know that kind of stereotyping in
 

01:11:28.369 --> 01:11:32.290
we all know that kind of stereotyping in
this society so black athletes sail

01:11:32.290 --> 01:11:32.300
this society so black athletes sail
 

01:11:32.300 --> 01:11:35.410
this society so black athletes sail
through white athletes club along you do

01:11:35.410 --> 01:11:35.420
through white athletes club along you do
 

01:11:35.420 --> 01:11:37.509
through white athletes club along you do
this you have them take the same task

01:11:37.509 --> 01:11:37.519
this you have them take the same task
 

01:11:37.519 --> 01:11:41.410
this you have them take the same task
but this time you say this is it just

01:11:41.410 --> 01:11:41.420
but this time you say this is it just
 

01:11:41.420 --> 01:11:42.910
but this time you say this is it just
before they take it you say this is a

01:11:42.910 --> 01:11:42.920
before they take it you say this is a
 

01:11:42.920 --> 01:11:45.600
before they take it you say this is a
test of sports strategic intelligence

01:11:45.600 --> 01:11:45.610
test of sports strategic intelligence
 

01:11:45.610 --> 01:11:49.029
test of sports strategic intelligence
now when you do that it reverses now the

01:11:49.029 --> 01:11:49.039
now when you do that it reverses now the
 

01:11:49.039 --> 01:11:51.520
now when you do that it reverses now the
white athletes do very well on that task

01:11:51.520 --> 01:11:51.530
white athletes do very well on that task
 

01:11:51.530 --> 01:11:53.319
white athletes do very well on that task
and the black athletes don't do nearly

01:11:53.319 --> 01:11:53.329
and the black athletes don't do nearly
 

01:11:53.329 --> 01:11:56.370
and the black athletes don't do nearly
as well but very dramatic and sizeable

01:11:56.370 --> 01:11:56.380
as well but very dramatic and sizeable
 

01:11:56.380 --> 01:11:59.500
as well but very dramatic and sizeable
differences in performance so III think

01:11:59.500 --> 01:11:59.510
differences in performance so III think
 

01:11:59.510 --> 01:12:02.169
differences in performance so III think
that at least the way I keep these

01:12:02.169 --> 01:12:02.179
that at least the way I keep these
 

01:12:02.179 --> 01:12:04.239
that at least the way I keep these
things straight in my mind is to think

01:12:04.239 --> 01:12:04.249
things straight in my mind is to think
 

01:12:04.249 --> 01:12:05.950
things straight in my mind is to think
about what what is salient you give

01:12:05.950 --> 01:12:05.960
about what what is salient you give
 

01:12:05.960 --> 01:12:08.580
about what what is salient you give
asian women a difficult math test and

01:12:08.580 --> 01:12:08.590
asian women a difficult math test and
 

01:12:08.590 --> 01:12:11.020
asian women a difficult math test and
for for some of them just before they

01:12:11.020 --> 01:12:11.030
for for some of them just before they
 

01:12:11.030 --> 01:12:12.779
for for some of them just before they
take it you remind them of their gender

01:12:12.779 --> 01:12:12.789
take it you remind them of their gender
 

01:12:12.789 --> 01:12:16.270
take it you remind them of their gender
then they do worse than men others you

01:12:16.270 --> 01:12:16.280
then they do worse than men others you
 

01:12:16.280 --> 01:12:17.919
then they do worse than men others you
remind them just before they take it of

01:12:17.919 --> 01:12:17.929
remind them just before they take it of
 

01:12:17.929 --> 01:12:20.379
remind them just before they take it of
their ethnicity then they do the same or

01:12:20.379 --> 01:12:20.389
their ethnicity then they do the same or
 

01:12:20.389 --> 01:12:23.500
their ethnicity then they do the same or
slightly better than then men so a lot

01:12:23.500 --> 01:12:23.510
slightly better than then men so a lot
