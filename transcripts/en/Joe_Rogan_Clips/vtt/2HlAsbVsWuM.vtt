1
00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:03.370
The Joe Rogan experience.
Well,

2
00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:07.350
it's fascinating to me that the geneticists would rely on the archeologists

3
00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:10.110
being that the geneticists have the actual DNA.

4
00:00:10.111 --> 00:00:13.450
They can examine where the archeologists are piecing things together.
Yeah,

5
00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.510
absolutely.
Tiny bits of information over the entire landscape.

6
00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.290
And then you consider how much information they don't have access to that's in

7
00:00:22.291 --> 00:00:23.340
the ground.
Exactly.

8
00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:27.750
I strongly resist the idea that archeology is a science.
I,

9
00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:30.120
I don't think it should be described as a science.

10
00:00:30.121 --> 00:00:33.030
What do you think it should be described as?
It's more like a kind of philosophy.

11
00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:33.990
It's a,
it's a,
it's a,

12
00:00:33.991 --> 00:00:38.991
it's an attempt to interpret the past based on rather flimsy and limited

13
00:00:40.921 --> 00:00:41.371
evidence.

14
00:00:41.371 --> 00:00:44.490
And what you find in that interpretation is that the preconceptions of the

15
00:00:44.491 --> 00:00:47.430
individuals involved are being imposed upon the evidence,

16
00:00:47.431 --> 00:00:50.610
which then turns out to support their preconceptions.

17
00:00:50.611 --> 00:00:52.560
And that's not a scientific way of doing things.

18
00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.240
Assigned to any way of doing things is testing,

19
00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.560
testing hypotheses and false seeking to falsify them and seeing if they,
if they,

20
00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:59.490
if they work out.

21
00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.030
So the problem is drawing these conclusions and then being too rigid with these

22
00:01:03.031 --> 00:01:07.240
conclusions.
That's on further evidence.
That's,
that's my view.
Yeah.
That,
that,

23
00:01:07.241 --> 00:01:11.520
that,
that um,
archeology has been,
has been much too rigid and,
and the,

24
00:01:11.521 --> 00:01:15.390
and that there's a,
there's a climate of fear in archeology.

25
00:01:15.391 --> 00:01:17.880
I don't mean to pick particularly on archeologists here.

26
00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:22.530
I think this is generally true across other disciplines as well.

27
00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:27.660
Um,
these days academics are driven by the need to publish research papers.

28
00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:29.400
That's what they build their careers on.

29
00:01:29.401 --> 00:01:33.180
If they can get a paper on their bit of research published in nature of the

30
00:01:33.181 --> 00:01:35.430
proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,
et Cetera,

31
00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.680
that's good for their careers.

32
00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.950
But then you confront the gatekeepers in those publications who regard any

33
00:01:42.991 --> 00:01:47.040
archeological idea that is not part of the mainstream accepted consensus with

34
00:01:47.041 --> 00:01:51.870
great suspicion and are most most reluctant,
uh,
to,
to,

35
00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.260
you know,
to publish,
to publish that information.
Now,

36
00:01:55.261 --> 00:01:58.280
what is the mainstream,
what,
when,

37
00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:03.090
when archeologists talk about seafaring humans,
when,
what do they date that too?

38
00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:05.460
Well,
there's the Great Asians.
Yes,

39
00:02:05.461 --> 00:02:09.540
the great seafaring adventure that is accepted by archeology is called the

40
00:02:09.541 --> 00:02:12.390
Polynesian expansion.
And it's a remarkable story.

41
00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.740
And that occurs roughly 3000 to 3,500 years ago.

42
00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.970
And those Polynesians were amazing ocean navigators.
They could,

43
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.650
they could cross distances of thousands of kilometers with pinpoint accuracy.

44
00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:26.190
I mean,

45
00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.780
it's not an accident that the Polynesians found Easter island fighting Easter

46
00:02:30.781 --> 00:02:32.940
island is a really challenging project.

47
00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.300
Easter island is 2000 miles from the coast of South America.

48
00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.930
It's 2000 miles from the nearest other island,
which is Tahiti.

49
00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.720
It's just a little speck in the middle of the ocean.

50
00:02:42.721 --> 00:02:46.710
But the Polynesians founded and settled there and appear to have brought a

51
00:02:46.711 --> 00:02:51.090
reproductively viable population there and appear to have made voyages back and

52
00:02:51.091 --> 00:02:54.780
forth.
But that was 3000 to 3,500 years ago.

53
00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.620
That was not 12,800 years ago.
Uh,
and this is,

54
00:02:58.621 --> 00:03:03.621
this is where archeology is adamant position that ocean voyaging was begun by

55
00:03:04.901 --> 00:03:08.020
the Polynesians and that there was no major ocean voyages before.

56
00:03:08.021 --> 00:03:10.960
That I think needs to be strongly questioned and it needs to be strongly

57
00:03:10.961 --> 00:03:14.440
questioned in the light of this DNA evidence from the Amazon rather than

58
00:03:14.441 --> 00:03:17.920
rejecting the evidence and attempt should be made to consider what that might

59
00:03:17.921 --> 00:03:22.300
mean.
Well,
it's interesting because we know that the Egyptians had boats.
Yeah.

60
00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.290
And so what I mean,
if there were boats 4,000,
500 years ago,

61
00:03:26.291 --> 00:03:28.330
why do we think that they didn't try them out in the ocean?

62
00:03:28.331 --> 00:03:31.450
That doesn't make any sense.
Especially if there exists a thousand years prior,

63
00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:36.130
which is also possible.
Archeologist wouldn't argue that the Egyptians had boats,

64
00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.600
but,
but that is,
that is still within the,
the framework of accepted history.
It's,

65
00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:41.710
it's the notion of a,

66
00:03:41.711 --> 00:03:46.711
of a global navigating culture in the ice age that archeologists can't swallow.

67
00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:52.030
It's a subject that I've kept on coming up against over a number of years.

68
00:03:52.031 --> 00:03:55.900
I think the best evidence for it is ancient maps,
uh,

69
00:03:55.901 --> 00:03:59.260
which show the world as it looked during the last ice age.

70
00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:02.140
I've first explored this in fingerprints of the gods and I've touched on the

71
00:04:02.141 --> 00:04:05.080
mystery again and I haven't it an appendix on the subject in,
in,

72
00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:07.300
in this book because I think these are very important.

73
00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:12.630
We're talking about maps that were drawn roughly between the 13 hundreds and the

74
00:04:12.761 --> 00:04:16.960
17 hundreds.
Uh,
in other words,
in relatively recent history,

75
00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.033
however,

76
00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:22.390
these maps were largely based on much older source maps,

77
00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:23.740
which they copied.

78
00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.580
And we can say that for sure because one of the famous maps is the period Reese

79
00:04:27.581 --> 00:04:32.230
map,
which was created by a Turkish admiral called Perry Reece in the year 15,
13.

80
00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:36.730
Uh,
actually only a corner of his map has survived.
It was originally a world map.

81
00:04:36.731 --> 00:04:40.660
We now just have a bit that shows the east coast of South America and North

82
00:04:40.661 --> 00:04:42.820
America and the west coast of Africa,

83
00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:48.040
Perry Reece rights in that map that it is in his own handwriting that he based

84
00:04:48.041 --> 00:04:50.770
it on more than 100 older source maps,

85
00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:55.810
some of which had come from the library of Alexandria.
In other words,

86
00:04:55.811 --> 00:04:59.290
that maps had been when the library of Alexandria had been destroyed in the

87
00:04:59.291 --> 00:05:01.000
fourth century D or whenever it was.

88
00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:05.320
Some of its contents had been rescued and brought to Constantinople which became

89
00:05:05.321 --> 00:05:09.250
the Turkish capitol and Perry Reece had access to those maps and he incorporated

90
00:05:09.251 --> 00:05:14.230
information from those maps on his maps as well as incorporating more recent

91
00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:18.670
navigational information and this is one of a whole category of maps which are

92
00:05:18.671 --> 00:05:20.170
extremely hard to explain.

93
00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:25.120
All of them based on older source maps now lost all of them incorporating

94
00:05:25.121 --> 00:05:28.660
extremely precise relative longitudes and latitudes.

95
00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:31.960
Latitude is not that difficult to technological feat,

96
00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:34.690
but longer chewed is a difficult technological feat.

97
00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:37.210
Longitude involves a chronometer.

98
00:05:37.211 --> 00:05:39.430
It involves knowing the time at the place you began,

99
00:05:39.431 --> 00:05:41.950
your voyage and the local and local noon as well.

100
00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:43.630
And calculating the difference between them.

101
00:05:43.631 --> 00:05:48.610
You need a chronometer that we'll keep accurate time at sea with the Mo motions

102
00:05:48.611 --> 00:05:52.900
of a ship.
And it's just a plain fact that our civilization did not invent such a

103
00:05:52.901 --> 00:05:55.690
chronometer until the late 18th century.

104
00:05:55.900 --> 00:06:00.320
Before that we know what longitude where we were at and ships were constantly

105
00:06:00.321 --> 00:06:03.860
sailing unexpectedly into coastlines that they thought were hundreds of miles

106
00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:04.971
further away.

107
00:06:04.971 --> 00:06:09.140
So the discovery of the technique to do longer chewed was a major civilizational

108
00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:10.003
advance.

109
00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:14.570
Its presence in maps based on much older source maps that actually show the

110
00:06:14.571 --> 00:06:19.220
world as it looks during the last ice age suggests that somebody during the last

111
00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:23.610
ice age was mapping the world and had mastered the technique of calculating a

112
00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:28.180
longitude.
Classic example of these maps,
um,

113
00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:32.840
and I make a point at this is what's called the Pinkerton world map,

114
00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:38.260
which was drawn in the year 1818 and it was based on the latest navigational

115
00:06:39.351 --> 00:06:43.220
information at that time.
I reproduced that map in the,
in the book.

116
00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:47.210
What's missing from the map entirely missing is Antarctica.

117
00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:51.260
There's just a hole at the bottom of the world.
There's nothing there.

118
00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:54.980
And the reason,
the reason,
there's nothing there,
there's another,

119
00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:59.510
there's another pink than map that,
uh,
that shows that,
um,
the,

120
00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:04.940
the reason that you need to find one that's centered on Antarctica,
the reason,

121
00:07:04.941 --> 00:07:08.870
the reason that Antarctica is not there is that our civilization hadn't

122
00:07:08.871 --> 00:07:13.871
discovered Antarctica in 1818 so they couldn't authentically put it on a map in

123
00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:15.680
1818 actually,

124
00:07:15.681 --> 00:07:20.540
we discovered it in 1819 and that's when it starts appearing on modern maps.

125
00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:25.880
The problem is that Antarctica repeat appears repeatedly on these much older

126
00:07:25.881 --> 00:07:30.830
maps and it appears in the right place and a bit bigger than it is today,

127
00:07:30.831 --> 00:07:33.320
but very much as it looked during the last ice age.

128
00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:38.180
So what all of this suggests to me is that the world was mapped and explored by

129
00:07:38.181 --> 00:07:41.660
a global seafaring culture with the level of technology that was at least

130
00:07:41.661 --> 00:07:45.410
equivalent to ours at the end of the 18th century.
Uh,
during the ice age.

131
00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:49.820
Wasn't there also a map of Greenland that showed it underneath the ice?
Yes,

132
00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:54.140
there are.
And,
and,
and,
and uh,
another intriguing thing I met,

133
00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:59.030
I mentioned the period Reece map just now shown on the period Reese map lying

134
00:07:59.031 --> 00:08:04.031
off the east coast of North America is a large island with a row of megaliths,

135
00:08:04.101 --> 00:08:08.330
like a road of megaliths running up the middle of it.
Um,

136
00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:13.310
that island is in the exact place of the Grand Bahama banks.
Uh,
and,

137
00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:17.600
and the last one.
Yeah,
it is.
Um,

138
00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:20.100
but can I point it out to you because we're not sure.

139
00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:25.160
That's right.
Okay.
The thing that one,
okay,

140
00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:28.280
that's great that you can bring this up Jeremy.
That's amazing.

141
00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:32.790
So this island is sitting there off the southeast coast of North America where

142
00:08:33.050 --> 00:08:34.880
these to draw things back then too.

143
00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:40.200
And what you see running down the middle of it is this road like feature of a

144
00:08:40.201 --> 00:08:43.800
mega list c right there.
Yeah.
Now,

145
00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:47.260
the thing is,
it was a long period of my life when I,

146
00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:50.930
I did a lot of scuba diving and I was looking at at underwater structures and

147
00:08:50.931 --> 00:08:53.750
one of the sites had typed on was the Bimini road,

148
00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:58.050
which is in the Grand Bahama banks and the [inaudible] road is exactly where the

149
00:08:58.051 --> 00:09:00.480
island is and the that,
here's the issue.

150
00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:04.320
I don't care whether the Bimini road is natural or manmade.

151
00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:08.220
For me the mystery is that it is shown above water on that map.

152
00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:12.300
And the last time it was above water was thousands and thousands of years ago.

153
00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:16.500
So for me this is all evidence that we shouldn't dismiss the possibility that

154
00:09:16.501 --> 00:09:20.190
our ancestors had achieved a level of technology where they could explore in

155
00:09:20.191 --> 00:09:22.730
that the world's oceans.
We shouldn't dismiss that.
There it is.

156
00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:27.190
We don't know what those stones are,
how they were created by bully.

157
00:09:27.191 --> 00:09:30.840
Do they look artifacts you on a Goonie in Japan.
We're looking at now,

158
00:09:30.841 --> 00:09:34.110
but the go back to that image and did the last image that we were just looking

159
00:09:34.111 --> 00:09:34.591
at.
Look at that.

160
00:09:34.591 --> 00:09:38.550
I mean that looks so [inaudible] and you can see that is rather than like the,

161
00:09:38.551 --> 00:09:41.670
the,
the pattern that's showing on the,
on the island in the,
in the map,

162
00:09:41.730 --> 00:09:44.820
how deep is that today?
Oh,
it's not very deep.
It's about 20 feet then.

163
00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:48.480
But we think that that was above water at some point with Steve was definitely

164
00:09:48.481 --> 00:09:52.580
above water during the last ice age when it,
when it finally went underwater.

165
00:09:52.590 --> 00:09:54.530
May have been as late as eight or 9,000 years ago.

166
00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:57.660
Is there anything else compelling that's in the immediate area that seems to

167
00:09:57.661 --> 00:10:00.060
indicate that there was some sort of a manmade structure?
Well,

168
00:10:00.061 --> 00:10:01.350
nobody's looked for it.
Uh,

169
00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:05.130
and the whole effort of archeology has been to dismiss the significance of the

170
00:10:05.131 --> 00:10:07.990
bib.
Any road.
How would they dismiss that?
Well,
they say it's just a me,

171
00:10:08.010 --> 00:10:12.750
they say it's totally Natural Karma is it?
Let's go.
Go back to that image again.

172
00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:15.000
Some other ones listen,
but,
but well this is the odd,

173
00:10:15.001 --> 00:10:18.360
could go back to that image that we just saw.
Yeah,
yeah,
sure.

174
00:10:18.361 --> 00:10:21.030
Somebody who spent a lot of time diving on the Bimini road.

175
00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:23.820
I can tell you I absolutely do not think it's natural.

176
00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:25.140
I think it's a manmade structure,

177
00:10:25.141 --> 00:10:28.770
but the argument is that it's a kind of beach rock that forms in these blocky

178
00:10:28.830 --> 00:10:31.980
formation is that speech rock does for in Bucky permission,

179
00:10:31.981 --> 00:10:35.520
but here I believe that the beach rock has been used as a construction material,

180
00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.260
but I repeat,

181
00:10:37.650 --> 00:10:42.060
the key issue is not whether the Bimini road is my made or not.

182
00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:47.100
The key issue is that it features on a map above water and that is a dating

183
00:10:47.101 --> 00:10:51.300
project that tells us that somebody was mapping that bit of the world when it

184
00:10:51.301 --> 00:10:55.710
was above water and that takes us back a very long,
a long way into the past.

185
00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:57.780
The the one that you just pulled up.
Yeah,
look at that one.

186
00:10:58.110 --> 00:11:00.450
That's a stunning place,
isn't it mate?
It's amazing site.

187
00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:05.340
It's just like the odds of that being in that order with those uniformly sized

188
00:11:05.341 --> 00:11:09.500
rocks first.
How long is that?
Oh,
hundreds of feet.
It's not a huge,

189
00:11:09.630 --> 00:11:11.190
it's actually shaped like the letter j.

190
00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:15.270
It's a giant underwater structure is really,
really an enormous thing and very,

191
00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:17.460
very beautiful dive on.
And there's lots of very gentle,

192
00:11:17.461 --> 00:11:19.590
sweet nurse sharks down there that you can play with this.

193
00:11:19.591 --> 00:11:23.340
So that looks much more like random.
That's more random and bits of it,

194
00:11:23.341 --> 00:11:27.900
bits of it do look more random.
Bits of it look highly constructed.
I would not,

195
00:11:27.901 --> 00:11:29.880
um,
I would not seek to,

196
00:11:30.210 --> 00:11:33.600
to claim that the Bimini road is absolutely manmade.

197
00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:37.140
My claim about the Bimini road is it's really fucking weird that it appears on a

198
00:11:37.141 --> 00:11:40.260
map above water,
a map that was drawn in 15,

199
00:11:40.261 --> 00:11:42.210
13 based on older source maps.
