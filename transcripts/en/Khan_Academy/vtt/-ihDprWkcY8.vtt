00:00:00.457 --> 00:00:01.972
- [Instructor] Pamela was asked to find

00:00:01.972 --> 00:00:03.856
where h of x equals x to the third

00:00:03.856 --> 00:00:08.270
minus six x squared plus 12
x has a relative extremum.

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:09.784
This is her solution.

00:00:09.784 --> 00:00:12.528
So step one, it looks like she
tried to take the derivative.

00:00:12.528 --> 00:00:15.102
Step two, she tries to find the solution,

00:00:15.102 --> 00:00:17.026
find where the derivative is equal to zero

00:00:17.026 --> 00:00:19.075
and she found that it
happens at x equals two

00:00:19.075 --> 00:00:21.240
so she says that's a critical point.

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.692
In step three, she says,
she makes the conclusion

00:00:23.692 --> 00:00:27.372
that therefore h has a
relative extremum there.

00:00:27.372 --> 00:00:29.460
Is Pamela's work correct?

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.625
If not, what's her mistake?

00:00:31.625 --> 00:00:33.749
So pause this video and try
to work through it yourself

00:00:33.749 --> 00:00:36.240
and see if Pamela's work is correct.

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:37.261
Alright, well, I'm just gonna try

00:00:37.261 --> 00:00:38.669
to do it again in parallel.

00:00:38.669 --> 00:00:40.293
So first, let me just
take the derivative here.

00:00:40.293 --> 00:00:42.167
So h prime of x.

00:00:42.167 --> 00:00:43.599
Just use the power rule multiple times.

00:00:43.599 --> 00:00:48.010
It's gonna be three x squared
for the x to the third.

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.342
Two times negative six is
negative 12 or minus 12 x

00:00:52.342 --> 00:00:55.701
and then the derivative of 12
x is plus 12 and let's see.

00:00:55.701 --> 00:00:57.975
You can factor out a three here.

00:00:57.975 --> 00:01:02.605
So it's three times x squared
minus four x plus four

00:01:02.605 --> 00:01:06.168
and this part is indeed
equal to x minus two squared.

00:01:06.168 --> 00:01:10.743
So this is equal to three
times x minus two squared.

00:01:10.743 --> 00:01:14.098
So her step one looks right on target.

00:01:14.098 --> 00:01:17.099
Okay, step two, the
solution of h prime of x

00:01:17.099 --> 00:01:20.272
is equal to zero is equal to x equals two.

00:01:20.272 --> 00:01:21.581
Yeah, that works out.

00:01:21.581 --> 00:01:22.848
If you were to say,

00:01:22.848 --> 00:01:26.244
if you were to say three
times x minus two squared

00:01:26.244 --> 00:01:29.075
which is h prime of x,
the first derivative,

00:01:29.075 --> 00:01:30.421
and set that equal to zero,

00:01:30.421 --> 00:01:34.103
this is going to be true
when x is equal to two

00:01:34.103 --> 00:01:36.921
and so any point where
your first derivative

00:01:36.921 --> 00:01:39.861
is equal to zero or it's undefined,

00:01:39.861 --> 00:01:42.231
it is indeed a critical point.

00:01:42.231 --> 00:01:45.217
So this step looks good so far

00:01:45.217 --> 00:01:49.308
and then step three, h
has a relative extremum

00:01:49.308 --> 00:01:50.891
at x equals two.

00:01:51.764 --> 00:01:53.690
Alright, so she made
a big conclusion here.

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:56.918
She assumed that because
the derivative was zero,

00:01:56.918 --> 00:01:59.164
that we have a relative extremum.

00:01:59.164 --> 00:02:01.908
So let's just see if you can
even just make that conclusion.

00:02:01.908 --> 00:02:04.653
In order to have a relative extremum,

00:02:04.653 --> 00:02:07.142
your curve is gonna
look something like this

00:02:07.142 --> 00:02:09.721
and then you would have a
relative extremum right over here

00:02:09.721 --> 00:02:12.753
and over here, your slope
goes from being positive

00:02:12.753 --> 00:02:16.594
and then it hits zero and
then it goes to being negative

00:02:16.594 --> 00:02:19.172
or you could have a
relative extremum like this.

00:02:19.172 --> 00:02:21.665
This would be a maximum point.

00:02:21.665 --> 00:02:25.415
This would be a minimum
point right over here

00:02:26.301 --> 00:02:28.106
and then in a minimum point,

00:02:28.106 --> 00:02:29.578
your slope is zero right over there

00:02:29.578 --> 00:02:31.464
but right before it,
your slope was negative

00:02:31.464 --> 00:02:33.797
and it goes to being positive

00:02:33.797 --> 00:02:36.501
but you actually have cases
where your derivative,

00:02:36.501 --> 00:02:38.182
your first derivative is zero

00:02:38.182 --> 00:02:40.717
but you don't have an extremum.

00:02:40.717 --> 00:02:45.419
So for example, you could
have a point like this

00:02:45.419 --> 00:02:47.252
where right over here,

00:02:48.203 --> 00:02:52.495
your slope or your derivative
could be equal to zero

00:02:52.495 --> 00:02:54.094
and so your first derivative
would be equal to zero

00:02:54.094 --> 00:02:56.302
but notice, your slope
is positive, it hits zero

00:02:56.302 --> 00:02:59.250
and then it goes back
to being positive again

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.461
and so you can't make the conclusion

00:03:01.461 --> 00:03:03.908
just because your derivative is zero

00:03:03.908 --> 00:03:05.665
that it's definitely an extremum.

00:03:05.665 --> 00:03:06.732
You could say it's a critical point

00:03:06.732 --> 00:03:08.243
and so step two is correct.

00:03:08.243 --> 00:03:10.204
In order to make this conclusion,

00:03:10.204 --> 00:03:12.624
you would have to test what
the derivative is doing

00:03:12.624 --> 00:03:14.862
before that point and after that point

00:03:14.862 --> 00:03:17.599
and verify that it is switching sides

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:19.028
and we could try to do that.

00:03:19.028 --> 00:03:22.483
So let's make a little table here.

00:03:22.483 --> 00:03:24.347
Make a little table.

00:03:24.347 --> 00:03:25.606
Do it a little bit neater.

00:03:25.606 --> 00:03:29.023
So x, x, h prime of x right over here.

00:03:31.172 --> 00:03:34.799
We know at x equals two,
h prime of two is zero.

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:36.440
That's our critical point.

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:37.911
But let's try, I don't know,

00:03:37.911 --> 00:03:40.902
let's see what happens
when x is equal to one

00:03:40.902 --> 00:03:42.618
and then let's see what
happens when x equals three.

00:03:42.618 --> 00:03:45.371
I'm just sampling points
on either side of two

00:03:45.371 --> 00:03:47.907
and let's see, we are going to have,

00:03:47.907 --> 00:03:48.970
when x is equal to one,

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:53.720
h prime of one is three
times one minus two squared.

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.763
One minus two, negative
one squared is positive one

00:03:55.763 --> 00:03:59.688
times three is still
positive and then three.

00:03:59.688 --> 00:04:02.061
Well, three minus two squared times three.

00:04:02.061 --> 00:04:03.626
That's also gonna be three.

00:04:03.626 --> 00:04:05.478
So this is actually a situation where,

00:04:05.478 --> 00:04:07.743
like I've just drawn it
where our slope is positive

00:04:07.743 --> 00:04:09.359
before we hit the critical point,

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:13.448
it gets to zero but then it
starts becoming positive again

00:04:13.448 --> 00:04:15.985
and so that's why you
actually have to do this test

00:04:15.985 --> 00:04:18.108
in order to identify
whether it's an extremum.

00:04:18.108 --> 00:04:19.863
It turns out that this is not an extremum.

00:04:19.863 --> 00:04:23.130
This is not a maximum
or a minimum point here.

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.421
So Pamela's work is not correct

00:04:25.421 --> 00:04:27.553
and her mistake is step three.

00:04:27.553 --> 00:04:28.901
In order to make this conclusion,

00:04:28.901 --> 00:04:30.697
you would have to test on either side

00:04:30.697 --> 00:04:31.672
of that critical point.

00:04:31.672 --> 00:04:32.505
Test the first derivative.
