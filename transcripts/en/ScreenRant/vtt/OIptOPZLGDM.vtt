00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:07.140
It’s hard to find a modern movie that doesn’t
flaunt it’s CGI in your face.

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.040
And while that’s not necessarily a bad thing,
audiences come to assume that the medium is

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.350
used strictly for monsters, explosions, and
superpowers.

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:19.860
And while that might be true to an extent,
there are a lot more instances of subtle manipulation

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:21.090
than you might realize.

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.620
A little softening here, a little lens flare
there, and suddenly the whole movie is completely

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:26.620
different.

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:29.510

And hey, can you guess the movie based on
these emojis?

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.210
Stay tuned for the answer, and play along
with our trivia questions as we go through

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.809
the entries.

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:54.930
Here are 10 CGI Movie Moments That Completely
Fooled You!

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.920
John Wick
If you’ve seen John Wick, you know that

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.840
there’s almost nothing funny about it.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.329
In fact, it’s probably one of the most violent
movies in recent memory.

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:04.350
And for good reason.

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.110
So while a lot of the rage on screen is very
real, a smaller, stinkier element was added

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:10.110
in post.

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.340
The audience doesn’t get a lot of time to
bond with Wick’s adorable puppy friend,

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.490
but Daisy makes an impression regardless.

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:17.010
And even got her own CGI specialist.

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.000
The her charming little turds are 100% fake.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.380
A classic case of Hollywood tampering— even
the poop is perfect.

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.750
Gladiator
Sadly, Hollywood has lost many great performers

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.530
over the last twenty years.

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.619
And when an actor passes away during filming,
not only does it take an emotional toll on

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:39.830
the cast, crew, and loved ones, but it also
poses a tricky logistical hurdle.

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.799
Especially if they hadn’t finished filming
their scenes.

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:47.710
When Oliver Reed passed in 1999, Gladiator
hadn’t wrapped shooting and the crew scrambled

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.090
to find a solution for the rest of his scenes.

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.460
Using earlier footage, they were able to map
Reed’s face from earlier scenes onto another

00:01:54.460 --> 00:02:09.380
body, and brilliantly synthesize the rest
of his performance.

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:16.180
The Social Network
Before The Social Network, nobody had heard

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:17.640
the name Armie Hammer.

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.680
So when he showed up in duplicate, everyone
just assumed the casting director came across

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.460
some super hot twins.

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.930
And considering how clean the CGI is, we can’t
blame you for that.

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.950
But it turns out Earth is not that lucky,
and there’s only one Armie Hammer playing

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:32.260
two characters.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.870
Depending on who you are, the Winklevoss twins
are either the inventors of Facebook or butt-hurt

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:37.900
frat bros.

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:45.110
But we can all agree on one thing: they’re
dang handsome.

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.849
Furious 7
After Paul Walker’s untimely death in November

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:53.599
2013, the Furious 7 crew found themselves
in a similar predicament as the team from

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:54.599
Gladiator.

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:59.250
A half finished performance, devastated community,
and unforgivable Hollywood deadlines all put

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.470
pressure on the team behind the scenes.

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.120
And it was the actor’s brothers who came
to the rescue.

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.920
Production used them as stand-ins for their
late sibling, and the computer wizards on

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.820
staff mapped Paul’s face on to them, completing
the performance.

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:16.580
With all the chases, explosions, and general
eye-candy contained in the Fast and Furious

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:18.750
franchise, there’s a lot to distract audiences.

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.959
So if you fell for it, you’re not alone.

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:27.349
Theory of Everything
Stephen Hawking is one of the most brilliant

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:29.659
minds to ever grace this planet.

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:32.310
And its about time the man got his own dang
movie.

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:37.400
Eddie Redmayne bravely signed on to portray
the genius in 2014’s The Theory of Everything.

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:42.310
Chronicling his life, the film inevitably
shows the intense impact ALS has on Hawking’s

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:43.310
body.

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.260
And while Remayne’s performance is detail-oriented
and accurate, there are some symptoms that

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.040
can’t be faked without a little help.

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.030
In one shot focusing on his twitching muscles,
the filmmakers layered two different takes

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.000
on top of each other to get the effect.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.909
The first was a still closeup, and in the
next the actor flexed and wiggled his fingers

00:03:58.909 --> 00:04:13.970
to mimic the erratic twitches.

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:16.690
Ant Man
If you saw Ant Man and found yourself thinking

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:25.340
about how great Michael Douglas is looking
these days, congratulations: you’re a sucker.

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:32.370
It’s not a raw food diet, botox, or anything
else Gwyneth Paltrow might be shilling on

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:33.370
Instagram.

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:36.220
It’s good old-fashioned post-production
manipulation.

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:40.590
CGI softening and blurring were used to get
that big screen babyface glow.

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:42.370
People in the ‘biz call it “beauty work”.

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:47.139
Obviously the filmmakers got into a whole
lot of computer-generated shenanigans to bring

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:51.030
the story of Ant Man to life, but we thought
they might have just used some trick-lighting

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:58.180
and makeup to bring the actor back thirty
years.

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:01.240
Forrest Gump
He may be in a wheelchair, but we know Lieutenant

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.560
Dan could kick our sorry asses in a fight.

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:07.610
The Vietnam vet and commanding officer has
seen carnage we can’t even fathom.

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:12.160
And even though he’s a hard-drinking, chain-smoking
son of a gun, deep down we know he’s a good

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.160
guy.

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:16.490
One of Forrest Gump’s BFF’s, Dan is a
double amputee.

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:21.120
Considering the film was released in 1994,
and before the CGI boom, you might assume

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.080
Gary Sinise is in a clever costume.

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:25.710
Or maybe even sitting atop an optical illusion.

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:27.510
But you’d be wrong.

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:33.010
CGI strikes again!

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:36.470
Nightcrawler link
The man bun: not since the mullet has there

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:39.190
been a hairstyle so controversial.

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:44.190
But usually all it takes is one brave celeb
to bring a questionable style into the mainstream.

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:49.250
So when Jake Gyllenhaal rocked a little pony
atop his noggin in 2014’s Nightcrawler,

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:50.940
people lost their minds.

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:55.080
Advocates were stoked about having a celebrity
endorser, and dissenters had to pretend that

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:56.760
they didn’t like the actor anymore.

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:00.210
But deep down, no-one can deny their love
for the Gyllenhaals.

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:04.610
And when we found out that the hair-don’t
was occasionally CGI’d onto his head, we

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:10.800
realized that he was the victim in this scenario.

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:14.539
The Wolf of Wall Street
To be fair, there is a lot going on in The

00:06:14.539 --> 00:06:15.620
Wolf of Wall Street.

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:20.760
Sex, drugs, money, and all around debauchery
fill its entire one hundred and eighty minutes.

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:25.770
And in true Scorsese fashion, it’s chockfull
of Hollywood’s biggest and brightest stars.

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:29.080
So if you missed a few things here and there,
we really can’t blame you.

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:32.889
Obviously a lot of movies are shot on sound
stages and cleaned up in post.

00:06:32.889 --> 00:06:38.120
But when we learned that almost every single
backdrop in Wolf of Wall Street is computer-generated,

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:39.360
we were blown away.

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:43.930
It’s so expertly blended that, even if you
pulled your eyes off of Margot Robbie, you

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:59.680
still wouldn’t notice.

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:03.240
If I Stay
Actors go through all sorts of training in

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:06.509
preparation for whatever upcoming role they’ve
signed on to do.

00:07:06.509 --> 00:07:10.639
And when it came to learning cello for her
role in If I Stay, Chloe Grace Moretz gave

00:07:10.639 --> 00:07:12.130
it the old college try.

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:16.229
The actress spent countless hours working
on her musical skills but she never got good

00:07:16.229 --> 00:07:18.660
enough to convincingly fake it for the camera.

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:22.740
Luckily for her, there was a CGI wizard ready
to step in and fix things.

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:26.720
Production used a body double for the cello
scenes and digitally laid the actress’ face

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:27.720
over top.

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:31.960
So instead of complimenting her musical ability,
give a high five to the FX guy instead.

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:35.319
And the answer to the movie emoji is: ______________.

00:07:35.319 --> 00:07:36.319
What do you think?

00:07:36.319 --> 00:07:39.630
