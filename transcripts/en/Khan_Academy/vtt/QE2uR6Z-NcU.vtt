00:00:00.512 --> 00:00:01.470
Let's say I have a bag.

00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:04.110
And in that bag--
I'm going to put

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.470
some green cubes in that bag.

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:11.620
And in particular, I'm going
to put eight green cubes.

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:15.960
I'm also going to put
some spheres in that bag.

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.500
Let's say I'm going
to put nine spheres.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.290
And these are the green spheres.

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:22.730
I'm also going to put some
yellow cubes in that bag.

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:27.930
I'm going to put five of those.

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.810
And I'm also going to put some
yellow spheres in this bag.

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:34.594
And let's say I
put seven of those.

00:00:34.594 --> 00:00:36.260
I'm going to stick
them all in this bag.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:37.620
And then I'm going
to shake that bag.

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:38.920
And I'm going to pour it out.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.410
And I'm going to look
at the first object that

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:43.200
falls out of that bag.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.270
And what I want to think
about in this video

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.950
is what are the
probabilities of getting

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.580
different types of objects?

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:52.160
So for example, what
is the probability

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.430
of getting a cube of any color?

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.370
What is the probability
of getting a cube?

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.620
Well, to think about that
we should think about what--

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.310
or this is one way
to think about it--

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:04.900
what are all of the equally
likely possibilities that

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.560
might pop out of the bag?

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:07.890
Well, we have 8 plus 9 is 17.

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.660
17 plus 5 is 22.

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:12.620
22 plus 7 is 29.

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:14.360
So we have 29 objects.

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:15.787
There are 29 objects in the bag.

00:01:15.787 --> 00:01:16.620
Did I do that right?

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:19.440
This is 14, yup 29 objects.

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.660
So let's draw all of
the possible objects.

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:27.340
I'll represent it as this
big area right over here.

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.900
So these are all the
possible objects.

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.230
There are 29 possible objects.

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:34.630
So there's 29
equal possibilities

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.047
for the outcome of my experiment
of seeing what pops out

00:01:38.047 --> 00:01:39.630
of the bag, assuming
that it's equally

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.280
likely for a cube or a
sphere to pop out first.

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.690
And how many of them meet our
constraint of being a cube?

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.850
Well, I have eight green cubes,
and I have five yellow cubes.

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.610
So there are a
total of 13 cubes.

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.890
So let me draw
that set of cubes.

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:56.300
So there's 13 cubes.

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:04.280
We could draw it like
this-- there are 13 cubes.

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.702
This right here is the
set of cubes, this area.

00:02:06.702 --> 00:02:07.910
And I'm not drawing it exact.

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:08.660
I'm approximating.

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.090
It represents the
set of all the cubes.

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:12.840
So the probability
of getting a cube

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.820
is the number of events
that meet our criteria.

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:17.420
So there's 13
possible cubes that

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.100
have an equally likely
chance of popping out,

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.360
over all of the possible equally
likely events, which are 29.

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.832
That includes the
cubes and the spheres.

00:02:28.832 --> 00:02:30.290
Now let's ask a
different question.

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:35.030
What is the probability of
getting a yellow object, either

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.100
a cube or a sphere?

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.760
So once again, how many things
meet our conditions here?

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.460
Well, we have 5 plus 7.

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:46.790
There's 12 yellow
objects in the bag.

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.400
So we have 29 equally
likely possibilities.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.280
I'll do it in that same color.

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.670
We have 29 equally
likely possibilities.

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.520
And of those, 12
meet our criteria.

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:02.480
So let me draw 12
right over here.

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.480
I'll do my best attempt.

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.940
So let's say it looks
something like-- so

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:09.720
the set of yellow objects.

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.450
There are 12 objects
that are yellow.

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.530
So the 12 that
meet our conditions

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.407
are 12, over all the
possibilities-- 29.

00:03:18.407 --> 00:03:19.990
So the probability
of getting a cube--

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:25.480
13 29ths, probability of
getting a yellow-- 12 29ths.

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.730
Now let's ask something a
little bit more interesting.

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:32.869
What is the probability
of getting a yellow cube?

00:03:32.869 --> 00:03:33.910
So I'll put it in yellow.

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:35.243
So we care about the color, now.

00:03:35.243 --> 00:03:37.490
So this thing is yellow.

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:41.810
What is the probability of-- or
as my son would say, "lello."

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:45.310
What is the probability
of getting a yellow cube?

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:47.595
Well, there's 29 equally
likely possibilities.

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:54.870
And of those 29 equally likely
possibilities, 5 of those

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:59.290
are yellow cubes, or
"lello" cubes, five of them.

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:01.270
So the probability is 5 29ths.

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:03.900
And where would we see
that on this Venn diagram

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:04.570
that I've drawn?

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:06.610
This Venn diagram is
just a way to visualize

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:07.350
the different probabilities.

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:08.860
And they become
interesting when you

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:11.170
start thinking about
where sets overlap,

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:13.091
or even where they
don't overlap.

00:04:13.091 --> 00:04:14.590
So here we are
thinking about things

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:16.880
that are members
of the set yellow.

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.160
So they're in this set,
and they are cubes.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.980
So this area right
over here-- that's

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:25.730
the overlap of these two sets.

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:27.930
So this area right
over here-- this

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:30.960
represents things that
are both yellow and cubes,

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.180
because they are
inside both circles.

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:37.330
So this right over here-- let
me rewrite it right over here.

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:45.800
So there's five objects that
are both yellow and cubes.

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.430
Now let's ask-- and this is
probably the most interesting

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:54.650
thing to ask-- what is
the probability of getting

00:04:54.650 --> 00:05:01.260
something that is yellow or or
a cube, a cube of any color?

00:05:04.485 --> 00:05:06.610
The probability of getting
something that is yellow

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:09.010
or a cube of any
color-- well, we still

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:11.110
know that the denominator
here is going to be 29.

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:13.400
These are all of the
equally likely possibilities

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.040
that might jump out of the bag.

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:18.360
But what are the possibilities
that meet our conditions?

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:22.860
Well, one way to think about
it is, well, the probability--

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:25.480
there's 12 things that would
meet the yellow condition.

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:27.950
So that would be this entire
circle right over here-- 12

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:30.160
things that meet the
yellow condition.

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.630
So this right over here is 12.

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:37.000
This is the number of yellow.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.400
That is 12.

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:41.460
And then to that, we can't
just add the number of cubes,

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:43.050
because if we add
the number of cubes,

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:44.950
we've already counted these 5.

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:47.570
These 5 are counted
as part of this 12.

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:49.220
One way to think
about it is there

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:52.280
are 7 yellow objects
that are not cubes.

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:53.410
Those are the spheres.

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:56.050
There are 5 yellow
objects that are cubes.

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:59.910
And then there are 8
cubes that are not yellow.

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:01.160
That's one way to think about.

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.290
So when we counted this
12-- the number of yellow--

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:05.254
we counted all of this.

00:06:05.254 --> 00:06:06.920
So we can't just add
the number of cubes

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:09.680
to it, because then we would
count this middle part again.

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:11.230
So then we have to
essentially count

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:17.060
cubes, the number of
cubes, which is 13.

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:22.900
So the number of
cubes, and we'll

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:26.740
have to subtract out this
middle section right over here.

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:27.670
Let me do this.

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:30.520
So subtract out the middle
section right over here.

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:32.220
So minus 5.

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:39.380
So this is the number
of yellow cubes.

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:41.720
It feels weird to write
the word yellow in green.

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:44.499
The number of yellow cubes-- or
another way to think about it--

00:06:44.499 --> 00:06:46.290
and you could just do
this math right here.

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:51.200
12 plus 13 minus 5 is 20.

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:52.210
Did I do that right?

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:54.690
12 minus, yup, it's 20.

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:55.470
So that's one way.

00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:57.865
You just get this is
equal to 20 over 29.

00:06:57.865 --> 00:06:59.990
But the more interesting
thing than even the answer

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:01.830
of the probability
of getting that,

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:05.430
is expressing this in terms
of the other probabilities

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:08.346
that we figured out
earlier in the video.

00:07:08.346 --> 00:07:09.970
So let's think about
this a little bit.

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:12.510
We can rewrite this
fraction right over here.

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:26.920
We can rewrite this as 12 over
29 plus 13 over 29 minus 5

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:28.030
over 29.

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:29.800
And this was the
number of yellow

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:31.710
over the total possibilities.

00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:33.870
So this right over here
was the probability

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:35.742
of getting a yellow.

00:07:35.742 --> 00:07:37.200
This right over
here was the number

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:39.590
of cubes over the
total possibilities.

00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:43.570
So this is plus the
probability of getting a cube.

00:07:46.547 --> 00:07:48.130
And this right over
here is the number

00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:51.170
of yellow cubes over
the total possibilities.

00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:54.520
So this right over here
was minus the probability

00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:58.052
of yellow, and a cube.

00:07:58.052 --> 00:07:59.510
I'm not going to
write it that way.

00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:02.840
Minus the probability
of yellow-- I'll

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:09.400
write yellow in yellow--
yellow and a cube.

00:08:12.464 --> 00:08:13.880
And so what we've
just done here--

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:14.980
and you could play
with the numbers.

00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:16.880
The numbers I just used
as an example right

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:18.820
here to make things a
little bit concrete.

00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:21.320
But you can see this is
a generalizable thing.

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:24.330
If we have the probability
of one condition

00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:28.027
or another condition-- so let me
rewrite it-- the probability--

00:08:28.027 --> 00:08:30.360
and I'll just write it a
little bit more generally here.

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:31.850
This gives us an
interesting idea.

00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:36.120
The probability of getting
one condition of an object

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:40.890
being a member of set
a, or a member of set b

00:08:40.890 --> 00:08:44.330
is equal to the probability
that it is a member of set a,

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:47.430
plus the probability that
is a member of set b,

00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:51.150
minus the probability
that is a member of both.

00:08:56.850 --> 00:08:58.540
And this is a really
useful result.

00:08:58.540 --> 00:08:59.850
I think sometimes it's
called the addition

00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:00.530
rule of probability.

00:09:00.530 --> 00:09:02.330
But I want to show you that
it's a completely common-sense

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:02.950
thing.

00:09:02.950 --> 00:09:05.890
The reason why you can't just
add these two probabilities

00:09:05.890 --> 00:09:08.150
is because they might
have some overlap.

00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:09.820
There's a probability
of getting both.

00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:11.380
And if you just
added both of these,

00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:13.590
you would be double
counting that overlap,

00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:16.070
which we've already seen
earlier in this video.

00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:18.570
So you have to subtract
one version of the overlap

00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:21.640
out so you are not
double counting it.

00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:23.820
I'll throw another
one other idea out.

00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:25.310
Sometimes, you
have possibilities

00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:26.672
that have no overlap.

00:09:26.672 --> 00:09:28.755
So let's say this is the
set of all possibilities.

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:37.970
And let's say this is the
set that meets condition a

00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:40.620
and let me do this
in a different color.

00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:43.580
And let's say that this is the
set that meets condition b.

00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:45.730
So in this situation,
there is no overlap.

00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:48.580
There's no way-- nothing is a
member of both sets, a and b.

00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:52.490
So in this situation, the
probability of a and b is 0.

00:09:52.490 --> 00:09:54.200
There is no overlap.

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:58.600
And these type of conditions,
or these two events,

00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:00.395
are called mutually exclusive.

00:10:05.310 --> 00:10:06.810
So if events are
mutually exclusive,

00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:11.420
that means that they both
cannot happen at the same time.

00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:15.800
There's no event that meets
both of these conditions.

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:18.810
And if things are
mutually exclusive,

00:10:18.810 --> 00:10:21.410
then you can say the
probability of a or b

00:10:21.410 --> 00:10:24.950
is the probability of a plus
b, because this thing is 0.

00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:27.170
But if things are not
mutually exclusive,

00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:29.240
you would have to
subtract out the overlap.

00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:31.360
And probably the
best way to think

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:33.320
about it is to
just always realize

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:35.400
that you have to
subtract out the overlap.

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:38.170
And obviously if something
is mutually exclusive,

00:10:38.170 --> 00:10:41.855
the probability of getting
a and b is going to be 0.
