00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:02.520
Objects are more than just actions.

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.720
Yeah, a dog can bark and wag its
tail but it's more than just that.

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.370
What if your objects were your customer.

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:12.630
Your customers have public actions but
private thoughts.

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.670
They've rich histories based on who and
where they came from, and

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:18.530
when something goes
wrong they let you know.

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.210
Objects are no different.

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.920
In this lesson, you'll keep exploring
more features of objects in Ruby.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.550
You'll get four aspects in particular.

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:31.160
You'll examine what an object's
public and private interfaces are and

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.420
learn more about how they can interact
with themselves and with other objects.

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:36.670
You'll learn how class methods and

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.349
class variables can help add even more
powerful features to your applications.

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:45.540
You'll discover how inheritance
allows classes to well, inherit

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:49.900
characteristics from other classes
saving you tons of code in the long run.

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.480
And lastly, you'll learn how to make
your objects throw descriptive and

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.320
meaningful errors and exceptions.

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.060
If someone's going to deal
with errors in your programs,

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:00.400
might as well make them helpful errors.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:00.950
Let's dive right in.
