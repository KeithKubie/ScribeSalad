00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:03.879
Hi, I'm Corey D'Augustine.

00:00:03.879 --> 00:00:05.250
Welcome back to In the Studio.

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.170
Today, we are responding to some of the comments
from previous sections, specifically some

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.060
interest in Pablo Picasso, undoubtedly one
of the most crucial artists of the 20th century.

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:17.210
Well, we're not going to take on our friend
Pablo directly.

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.029
Instead, we're going to explore one of the
movements that he is most closely associated

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.060
with, and, of course, that's Cubism.

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.949
Really one of the watershed moments in the
20th century is 1907's "Demoiselles d'Avignon,"

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:31.609
we'll take a look at that work in a moment,
launching Cubism, which gave way directly

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:33.230
to abstraction.

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.200
You may notice that we're in a slightly different
location today.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.070
The studio at MoMA is being renovated, so
we're actually at my house today.

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:41.070
Welcome.

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:47.080
But at any rate, today I'd like to explain
why Cubism happened, so not only demonstrate

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:52.030
how to make a Cubist-type painting, but really
understand how to look at a Cubist painting.

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.579
How to understand a Cubist handling of space
and the logic here since I think a lot of

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.150
us can agree that Cubism is one of the more
difficult movements to understand.

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:06.200
Part of my job here today is to unravel this
really interesting and complicated thread.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:11.590
So Pablo Picasso at the age of 14 painted
a painting that would be very comfortable

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:13.509
on the walls of Museo Prado.

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:17.770
That's the Prado Museum in Madrid where he
essentially went to school looking at great

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.909
paintings by Velazquez, by El Greco, by Zurbarán,
artists like that.

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:28.229
But before we Picasso, Picasso, Picasso, as
almost everyone does, I wanna give a really

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.380
well-deserved mention to Georges Braque, because
Braque, the French painter was really equally

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:37.850
responsible for the innovations and the inventions
of Cubism, as we'll see shortly.

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:43.289
1907, "Demoiselles d'Avignon," a great historical
moment in the beginning of the 20th century

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:45.139
where Picasso launches Cubism.

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:50.139
And as we look at this painting, which is
a MoMA's collection, notice that while certainly

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:55.380
realism is far from what Picasso's dealing
with here, instead he's compressed that space.

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.319
All this flat shard, it almost looks like
the picture plane is a sheet of glass that's

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:00.649
been shattered.

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:05.020
If you imagine how far you could walk into
the space of this painting, well, it's not

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.340
very far.

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.869
Contrast that with an old master painting,
think about "Mona Lisa," for example, and

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:14.210
suddenly imagine how far you could walk behind
"Mona Lisa" until you get to those mountains,

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:15.210
months perhaps, okay?

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:19.780
This is the space of painting that I'm talking
about here and that Picasso and Braque really

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:20.780
shattered.

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.610
But if we look down at the bottom end of this
painting, we realize why Picasso's painting

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:26.750
in this style.

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.780
This still life down here, which maybe you
didn't even notice at first, is in fact painted

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.810
from a different perspective.

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.280
What I mean by that is that when we look at
these lovely ladies, the demoiselles themselves,

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:38.490
it's a frontal perspective.

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.120
We are looking at them.

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.220
They're looking back at us.

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.690
And, in fact, that's just like every other
painting you've seen in an old master gallery,

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.180
the painter has one perspective.

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:52.530
Well, Picasso here, almost as a riddle, is
saying, is asking, "Well, what would a painting

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.640
look like if it had two perspectives?"

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.800
And the answer is, "It looks weird," because
none of us have an experience like this.

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:04.420
I am seeing one thing right now, and as you're
looking at the computer screen, you're seeing

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.010
one thing, your perspective.

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:12.660
Well, to juxtapose two different perspectives
in this very closed aesthetic space is difficult,

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.320
it's a head scratcher, it's a riddle.

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:19.590
Now, as we move forward by a couple years,
"Girl with Mandolin," also in the MoMA's collection,

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.380
we can see that there were far more than two
perspectives.

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.470
Each one of these shards, if you will, count
them...

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:25.470
I don't know.

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:26.470
I never did.

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:27.470
There's 40 or 50 something like that.

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.360
Each one of these shards is painted from a
different perspective.

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:34.711
And what I mean by that is that some of these
shards, if we move from left to right, go

00:03:34.711 --> 00:03:39.290
from a highlight to shadow, meaning that that
light source is on the left-hand side of the

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:40.530
canvas.

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:45.460
Other of those shards, however, go from shadow
to light, meaning that the light is on the

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:46.460
other side.

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:47.910
Now, this doesn't make sense.

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.050
This is not how we experience the world around
us.

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:54.850
And we realize that Picasso's pushing away
from realism, and he's becoming quite cerebral.

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:59.190
So "Girl with Mandolin," early, analytical,
Cubist painting.

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:00.190
Why analytical?

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:01.870
It's kind of chapter one of Cubism.

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:06.140
He's analyzing the space of this girl and
this musical instrument.

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:07.990
So, I’ve set up a still life here.

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:13.180
Before we take a look at the still life, I
want to show you the New York School artist

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:17.449
Ad Reinhardt’s comic explaining essentially
what I just explained to you.

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:21.570
If we take a look at this wonderful comic
by Reinhardt, we find ourselves at the Prado

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:25.430
or at the Met here in New York City and here’s
the space of that painting.

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:31.150
It’s from one perspective and we see the
illusion of depth, this great invention of

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:32.910
the European Renaissance.

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:36.180
If you look at a Cubist painting, however,
it’s flat and you can’t find any space

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:37.770
behind there whatsoever.

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:44.040
The reason why is that we’re not only looking
at this glass, this goblet, from one perspective—but

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:45.860
we have a side view and a top view.

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:51.440
In other words, the aerial view, looking straight
down juxtaposed together here.

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:55.520
And that aerial view is important because
photography of course exists at this point

00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:02.000
in time, and perhaps realism is not so interesting
anymore since you’re competing with photography.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.590
Perhaps a painter’s job then becomes more
difficult, more interesting, or perhaps more

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:06.590
cerebral.

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:08.690
I think Picasso would agree with that.

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:12.040
This canvas last week I stretched and primed.

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:13.720
This is a linen canvas.

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:17.440
You can see just because of its color here,
little brown, not the cotton duck that we

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:19.970
worked with in some of the previous demos.

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:24.430
And I've put a calcium or a chalk-based oil
ground here.

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:25.430
Why?

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:26.720
Well, Picasso typically worked this way.

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:29.740
Braque typically worked this way, not always,
by the way.

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:31.550
But you'll notice that it's a little bit more
translucent.

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:37.200
It's not a super hard, opaque white like a
lot of the more contemporary primers or gessos

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:38.250
are.

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:41.560
Also, this is an oil-based ground, not an
acrylic.

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:45.200
Acrylic, of course, didn't exist in the Cubist
era.

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:51.730
So what I'm going to do here is just simply
begin by thinking about this still life through

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:53.740
the lens of geometry.

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:57.300
And a very important artist, in fact, a very
important artist to Picasso and Braque is

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:58.300
Paul Cezanne.

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:04.620
Cezanne in 1904 talked about thinking about
nature in terms of cones, in terms of spheres,

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:10.199
in other words, reducing all that complexity
of our natural experience of the world through

00:06:10.199 --> 00:06:11.199
the lens of geometry.

00:06:11.199 --> 00:06:14.290
In fact, I'm going to do exactly the same
thing now.

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:19.590
In other words, I'm going to be finding linear
aspects of some wonderfully, delicate, and

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:26.560
non-linear shapes here.

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:31.790
Okay.

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:33.290
So I've just made a couple marks here.

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:39.240
What I'm doing is capturing the curve of the
stool, some the lines of this drapery, this

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:40.400
tablecloth, what have you.

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.120
Now, I'm going to do something weird.

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:45.770
Rather than continue with this drawing, I'm
going to move a little bit.

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:48.460
I'm going to continue with the drawing here,
but now from a different perspective.

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:53.650
Of course, everything has moved here, but
I'm going to continue seamlessly connecting

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:58.979
the lines that I've already made.

00:06:58.979 --> 00:07:06.770
So, for example, when I'm standing looking
at this wine bottle from this perspective,

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:11.570
I see a straight line, that's the label, in
the center of the bottle.

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:15.620
Of course, when I was over here, that straight
line coincided with the edge.

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:22.710
So on the one hand I've drawn the right edge
with that curve, but since I've captured the

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:27.320
center now here, I've sliced straight through
the center of the bottle.

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:31.180
Now, this is all going to start to make more
sense once we start filling in these empty

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:42.260
spaces around them.

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:46.830
Looking down on objects, looking up at objects,
capturing as many different perspectives as

00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:53.930
the still life allows.

00:07:53.930 --> 00:08:00.470
Okay.

00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:03.009
So we're halfway through the underdrawing
here.

00:08:03.009 --> 00:08:06.240
A couple things that you can notice here.

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:13.100
This semi-circle I started capturing an aerial
view looking down into that wine glass for

00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:14.100
half of it.

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:19.169
Right next to it, I was on the backside here
capturing a straight, on-frontal perspective,

00:08:19.169 --> 00:08:21.120
and there is that contour of the side.

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:23.570
Now, if they don't connect, and that's fine.

00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:27.780
It's interesting that as you move around,
of course, what you're looking at moves around.

00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:33.039
Sometimes, in a certain perspective, something's
in the front, and then from the reversed perspective,

00:08:33.039 --> 00:08:35.029
excuse me, of course, it's in the back.

00:08:35.029 --> 00:08:38.060
A couple of these leaves are summarized as
triangles.

00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:42.820
That wine bottle a couple times, different
contours, different edges, etc.

00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:47.830
Now, I may add a couple more lines later,
but this is coming from all of these different

00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:51.500
areas of that tablecloth that we're seeing
in all these interesting folds, which, of

00:08:51.500 --> 00:09:00.250
course, are rather soft, and I've summarized
them through very linear kind of geometry.

00:09:00.250 --> 00:09:02.300
So the next thing I'm going to do is some
shading.

00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:05.790
Now, of course, very little of this drawing
and very little of the shading is going to

00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:09.910
be evident in the finished painting, but this
is going to help me know what goes where in

00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:14.160
other words, and I can still edit freely at
this phase of the game.I'm going to reinforce

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:15.980
some of the shadows.

00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:21.800
I see it coming on the underside of there,
some of the shadows coming off of some of

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:34.080
these leaves.

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:46.320
Okay.

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:49.790
So a interesting-looking preparatory sketch
or an underdrawing.

00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:52.910
I haven't even picked up the paintbrush yet,
but you can start to see how some of these

00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:54.070
forms are developing.

00:09:54.070 --> 00:09:58.710
And you're getting the sense that rather than
this three-dimensional, illusionistic space

00:09:58.710 --> 00:10:03.060
that I could have created, instead of compressed
everything, I've taken that space and packed

00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:07.580
it into this very, very shallow and very narrow
pictorial space, very close to the picture

00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:08.580
plane.

00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:13.140
Now, it's not exactly the same plane, because
this shading, this modeling here tells you

00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:14.480
that things are a little bit tilted.

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:19.430
They're a little bit rounded like the edge
of the inside of the wine glass, etc.

00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:25.180
But, of course, it doesn't resolve, because
for your eye to really understand this rational,

00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:30.839
inhabitable, three-dimensional space, everything
needs to have the same type of shading.

00:10:30.839 --> 00:10:33.920
Instead, here everything is going every different
direction.

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:35.330
It's extraordinarily complex.

00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:36.370
All right.

00:10:36.370 --> 00:10:41.390
So taking a look at the palette that I'm preparing
here, you might rightly say, "Well, this is

00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:43.670
not the most beautiful palette in the world."

00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:47.200
If you looked at some of the work we did in
the style of de Kooning in previous weeks,

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:50.860
where there's celebration, there's explosion
of color at times, in here, well, there's

00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:55.950
a black, and a brown, and a lighter brown,
and an ocher, and a kind of earthy yellow

00:10:55.950 --> 00:10:56.960
color, and kind of a dull green.

00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:01.770
And I'll give you a couple hints of some more
vibrant colors over here, but, in fact, many

00:11:01.770 --> 00:11:06.990
of the early Cubist painters deliberately
worked with...let's call them boring or toned-down

00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:07.990
pallets.

00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:08.990
Why?

00:11:08.990 --> 00:11:11.600
Not because they didn't wanna make beautiful
paintings, certainly not, but because they

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:14.180
realized that color has a space of its own.

00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:18.870
And what I mean by that, and Cezanne knew
this very well, by the way, is that hot colors,

00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:21.770
like this red, they're very aggressively and
they push forward.

00:11:21.770 --> 00:11:25.910
Not the shading of the painting, but just
the color itself has a kind of space.

00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:30.520
Cool colors, like these blues and these grays
or some of the grays that I'm about to mix,

00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:32.730
so there's green here, they're calmer.

00:11:32.730 --> 00:11:35.222
They kind of are quieter in our eye.

00:11:35.222 --> 00:11:36.990
They retreat away from the picture plane.

00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:39.000
They press back into the space.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.670
In other words, they also have a kind of space.

00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:45.790
So I'm tackling Braque and Picasso "Circa,"
1910, 1911.

00:11:45.790 --> 00:11:49.380
There's not a whole lot of color, but, as
you can see, there's a whole lot of spatial

00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:50.380
complexity.

00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:53.370
Now, the first thing that I'm going to do
is to grab a rather large brush.

00:11:53.370 --> 00:11:57.300
I'm going to get a little bit of that murky
turpentine into my palette, and probably a

00:11:57.300 --> 00:12:01.590
good time to mention that there is not one
way to make a Cubist painting.

00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:06.080
So I'm just summarizing here, interpreting
some of these different techniques.

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:10.010
So a little bit of murky turpentine here,
and to that I'm going to take a little bit

00:12:10.010 --> 00:12:14.510
of Naples yellow and a little bit of ocher.

00:12:14.510 --> 00:12:17.899
A little bit more of ocher.

00:12:17.899 --> 00:12:20.810
Still a little bit more of ocher.

00:12:20.810 --> 00:12:26.149
Now, because I'm working with turpentine and
not with linseed oil, the binder, the vehicle

00:12:26.149 --> 00:12:30.120
of this paint, it's going to stay matte, and
it's going to stain into the canvas a little

00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:31.120
bit.

00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:32.600
It's not going to be so glossy and translucent.

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:34.019
It's going to be more matte and opaque.

00:12:34.019 --> 00:12:39.899
Now, I'm just going to use this to warm up
a couple areas out towards the edges of the

00:12:39.899 --> 00:12:41.010
canvas a little bit.

00:12:41.010 --> 00:12:48.390
You can see that this is going on quite thinly,
and that's great.

00:12:48.390 --> 00:12:56.310
You can also see that it does pick up the
charcoal a little bit.

00:12:56.310 --> 00:12:59.830
One reason that I'm starting off with this
light color, you're going to see that this

00:12:59.830 --> 00:13:02.460
painting will become quite dark.

00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:07.610
But it's much easier in oil painting wet-in-wet,
what I'm going to be demonstrating today,

00:13:07.610 --> 00:13:09.840
to go from light to dark than it is from dark
to light.

00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:14.160
In other words, if I put a dark color in here,
I'm going to make it really dark very quickly.

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:18.279
If I have a black paint, which I will, and
then I add some white to it or some yellow,

00:13:18.279 --> 00:13:20.670
it's going to stay quite muddy, quite dark.

00:13:20.670 --> 00:13:25.589
So, especially for beginning painters of this
technique, working light to dark is really

00:13:25.589 --> 00:13:27.410
going to save you some heartache.

00:13:27.410 --> 00:13:28.410
Okay.

00:13:28.410 --> 00:13:32.490
So what we can see here is that the painting
is still extremely flat, and this is really

00:13:32.490 --> 00:13:33.930
the name of the game here.

00:13:33.930 --> 00:13:38.060
The shading is still doing its function, but
now there are some warmer areas which are

00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:40.279
pushing forward in space a little bit.

00:13:40.279 --> 00:13:44.300
But what I'm going to do now to start going
back to the still life, looking at the colors

00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:49.720
that I'm seeing here and then interpreting
where these different shades are going to

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:50.720
go.

00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:51.720
And I'm going to start by...

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:56.060
I’m going to tell you, looking at the wine
glass, which to me looks pretty gray, I'm

00:13:56.060 --> 00:13:58.480
seeing some whites in there, I'm seeing some
dark grays.

00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:03.410
But a whole lot of that is a kind of medium
or even light grey, so let's mix up some of

00:14:03.410 --> 00:14:13.360
that.

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:18.870
You can see I'm keeping my brushstrokes very
short, staccato, and parallel.

00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:24.079
This is a technique that Braque and Picasso
used to further reinforce the flatness, the

00:14:24.079 --> 00:14:25.720
two-dimensionality of the picture plane.

00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:30.130
He wants to draw your attention to the fact
that these are individual marks placed right

00:14:30.130 --> 00:14:32.410
on the canvas flat.

00:14:32.410 --> 00:14:34.780
We're announcing this is an object.

00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:37.980
It's a flat canvas with little lumps of paint
on it.

00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:43.850
Well, if this doesn't sound very complicated,
in a sense it's not, but it's gloriously unsophisticated

00:14:43.850 --> 00:14:47.220
from Picasso here, who really had the more
sophisticated hand.

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:51.360
Well, what I'm going to do around that is
just reinforce those lines now, which, of

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:52.360
course, are just charcoal.

00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:53.360
They're just drawing lines.

00:14:53.360 --> 00:15:00.310
I'm going to reinforce them with some black,
black paint, I should say.

00:15:00.310 --> 00:15:07.470
And a nice trick if you really want to make
straight lines with paint is to use a metal

00:15:07.470 --> 00:15:20.800
edge.

00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:23.010
So now I'm executing some of these curves
here.

00:15:23.010 --> 00:15:33.990
I've just switched to a smaller brush.

00:15:33.990 --> 00:15:37.140
Let's call this the armature or the skeleton
of the painting here.

00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:40.350
We've reinforced those black lines and, in
fact, the grid, right?

00:15:40.350 --> 00:15:41.640
Up, down, left, right.

00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:46.470
The grid is very explicit here, so that is
the principal geometric device that I'm using

00:15:46.470 --> 00:15:51.990
to flatten all of this spatial complexity.

00:15:51.990 --> 00:15:55.820
Okay.

00:15:55.820 --> 00:16:10.790
So you can see what I've been doing here is
to start reinforcing some of the shading that

00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:16.230
was originally done with charcoal, darkening
them with some blacks and then some dark grey,

00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:20.279
and some of this modeling here going from
dark to light.

00:16:20.279 --> 00:16:25.490
One thing I'm noticing as I'm beginning to
get some of these tensions between the shadows

00:16:25.490 --> 00:16:30.740
and the hot spots here, you'll notice also
that sometimes I'm using highlights in white.

00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:35.480
Other times I'm letting this kind of Naples
yellow bright color peek through, relatively

00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:37.040
bright color anyway.

00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:40.770
One thing I'm going to do here is to start
reinforcing some of these lines, some of those

00:16:40.770 --> 00:16:42.220
black lines I've lost.

00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:46.540
And if you look carefully at Braque and Picasso
paintings, paintings by Juan Gris and others,

00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:50.820
you'll notice that those lines are repeated
again, and again, and again, and this is why

00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:52.130
I'm painting wet-in-wet.

00:16:52.130 --> 00:16:57.530
For example, this line here, which was a rather
delicate curved line, is now all fuzzy.

00:16:57.530 --> 00:16:58.530
Why?

00:16:58.530 --> 00:17:01.450
Because I've been using that chattering, kind
of staccato brush work in there, so I'm going

00:17:01.450 --> 00:17:05.019
to start reinforcing some of those lines,
darkening them, making them a little bit more

00:17:05.019 --> 00:17:06.019
crisp.

00:17:06.019 --> 00:17:07.900
I think I'm also going to add a couple more
verticals in here.

00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:36.410
So I'm going to do that, add a couple more
black lines now.

00:17:36.410 --> 00:17:39.650
I'm going to start building a couple more
of these mid-tones, these middle grays, which

00:17:39.650 --> 00:18:06.530
are nice and flexible, because I can either
lighten or deepen them as this painting develops.

00:18:06.530 --> 00:18:11.410
One thing you'll notice as I'm painting here,
I'm keeping the directionality of the brushwork

00:18:11.410 --> 00:18:16.840
quite parallel, and, again, this reinforces
the planarity of the painting itself, the

00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:17.900
flatness in other words.

00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:21.230
You'll also notice that as I'm starting to
do some of this rudimentary shading...

00:18:21.230 --> 00:18:22.230
I say rudimentary.

00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:26.620
This is deliberately rudimentary on the part
of these Cubists here, again, calling your

00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:31.130
attention to the bluntness, the physical presence
of the two-dimensional support here.

00:18:31.130 --> 00:18:34.600
I'm going sometime from dark to light, and
other times from light to dark.

00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:38.000
This is wet-in-wet or alla prima painting,
the same kind of technique actually that we

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:42.680
explored in de Kooning, wet, wet, wet paint,
but now it's very quiet.

00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:47.510
These small, little, staccato brush works
rather than these open end, cursive ones that

00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:55.130
we looked at in de Kooning's work.

00:18:55.130 --> 00:18:56.940
I'm going to start adding a little bit more
color.

00:18:56.940 --> 00:18:57.940
Don't get too excited.

00:18:57.940 --> 00:18:59.570
Just a little bit more color.

00:18:59.570 --> 00:19:01.630
This is an early Cubist-type painting after
all.

00:19:01.630 --> 00:19:04.470
But I'm going to start deepening some of these
yellows.

00:19:04.470 --> 00:19:08.370
I'm also going to start adding a touch of
green in the plant, a touch of red in the

00:19:08.370 --> 00:19:13.750
apple, some of the kind of peachy color of
the label of the wine bottle, as well as that

00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:19.030
nice burgundy up there at the top of the cap.

00:19:19.030 --> 00:19:21.240
All right.

00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:26.190
So, slowly, some color coming into the equation
here, maybe too much.

00:19:26.190 --> 00:19:27.190
We'll see about that.

00:19:27.190 --> 00:19:31.740
Some of these reds are looking aggressive,
especially that spot right there.

00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:35.559
I've added a couple hints of the red into
the black here as I'm noticing some of the

00:19:35.559 --> 00:19:41.429
tips of the individual leaf there go to purple
or a dark red, a little bit of yellow in there

00:19:41.429 --> 00:19:42.429
also.

00:19:42.429 --> 00:19:45.540
Now, clearly, this is not realism, and there's
not so much observation of color that I'm

00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:46.560
doing here.

00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:51.150
I'm more concerned with form, and space, and
how these things relate to each other.

00:19:51.150 --> 00:19:54.740
What I'm going to do next, again, is to start
reinforcing some of those blacks, some of

00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:59.080
those lines that have gotten a little bit
lost in some of this wet-in-wet painting,

00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:03.160
intermittently reinforcing that armature,
that grid, that framework of the composition

00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:36.580
before returning to the more elegant brushwork
between those lines.

00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:39.929
You can start to see that this composition
is tightening up.

00:20:39.929 --> 00:20:42.990
The brushwork is a little bit loose and jagged
in places.

00:20:42.990 --> 00:20:47.360
Here, this is really, to my eye, very hard
to understand what we're looking at here.

00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:52.890
This is, in fact, one shape of that wine glass
and then another reflection that's in it.

00:20:52.890 --> 00:20:56.520
But I forged that line a little bit here,
and I changed my mind about the colors, and

00:20:56.520 --> 00:20:58.500
the reflections are a little bit confusing
here.

00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:02.750
So that's going to need some editing, but
what I'm basically trying to do here is knock

00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:07.500
out all of these areas of the unpainted canvas
of that ground that are peeking through.

00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:10.360
Now, around the edges, not such a concern.

00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:14.820
In fact, you'll notice that most of my black
lines on the grid, I stop short of the edges.

00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:17.130
Now, some do go through, but a lot stop short.

00:21:17.130 --> 00:21:21.910
This is a really characteristic device of
early Cubism where they kind of fade out or

00:21:21.910 --> 00:21:24.460
get a little bit fuzzy toward the edges.

00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:27.150
Otherwise, this becomes very, very, rectilinear.

00:21:27.150 --> 00:21:30.630
In fact, an artist who took this idea and
ran with it is Piet Mondrian, someone who

00:21:30.630 --> 00:21:35.120
maybe we'll look at in another video sometime
who took that implicit grid here and made

00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:39.000
it explicit and basically made an entire career
out of that.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:43.670
So what I'm going to do is go back to that
middle dark gray and start to knock out some

00:21:43.670 --> 00:22:05.130
of these areas that are a little bit ambiguous
at the moment.

00:22:05.130 --> 00:22:06.130
All right.

00:22:06.130 --> 00:22:07.130
So a nice stopping point here.

00:22:07.130 --> 00:22:08.530
Some things I like, some things I don't.

00:22:08.530 --> 00:22:09.570
What do I like?

00:22:09.570 --> 00:22:14.250
I like how we're starting to build some interesting
contrast between the density of forms here

00:22:14.250 --> 00:22:18.490
and some of the looseness and the space around
the still life.

00:22:18.490 --> 00:22:23.450
But the Naples yellow that I find kind of
all over the canvas, remember that was actually

00:22:23.450 --> 00:22:27.940
the very first thing that I put down over
the drawing, it's a little bit too everywhere,

00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:31.820
meaning that this composition is kind of all
over, and I have a hard time differentiating

00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:33.820
the still life from the space around it.

00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:38.000
Now, as a matter of fact, this is exactly
the direction that Picasso and Braque pushed

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.070
in a little bit later.

00:22:40.070 --> 00:22:44.030
Here I wanted to have a little bit more difference
between the space of the still life and the

00:22:44.030 --> 00:22:45.330
space around it.

00:22:45.330 --> 00:22:48.350
And as I'm looking more at it, there's a couple
things I'm noticing.

00:22:48.350 --> 00:22:50.610
The tablecloth, if you will...

00:22:50.610 --> 00:22:52.289
First of all, I haven't added any of the blue
color in.

00:22:52.289 --> 00:22:53.289
I'll do that.

00:22:53.289 --> 00:22:59.270
But it's also quite light, and these light
areas are where I knocked out the canvas with

00:22:59.270 --> 00:23:00.559
this Naples yellow.

00:23:00.559 --> 00:23:01.880
It's the wrong color.

00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:05.880
It's not really light enough down here, so
I'm going to start adding a lot more, you

00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:09.309
know, light grays and some grays, light blues
here.

00:23:09.309 --> 00:23:14.090
Meanwhile, as I'm looking behind the still
life, there's a lot of empty dark space back

00:23:14.090 --> 00:23:17.580
there, so I'm going to start pushing this
a little bit further back, in other words,

00:23:17.580 --> 00:23:23.590
making a little bit more dark gray, a little
bit more black, up in this upper register

00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:24.590
of the painting.

00:23:24.590 --> 00:23:25.590
All right.

00:23:25.590 --> 00:23:26.590
So let's do it.

00:23:26.590 --> 00:23:30.030
Actually, this is probably a good time to
shift into my clean turpentine since I'm going

00:23:30.030 --> 00:23:45.169
to start working with some lighter colors.

00:23:45.169 --> 00:23:59.039
Okay.

00:23:59.039 --> 00:24:02.841
So I've effectively knocked out a lot of that
Naples yellow down at the lower margin of

00:24:02.841 --> 00:24:03.841
the painting here.

00:24:03.841 --> 00:24:07.460
Now, I like that color when it's peeking through,
but I think we agree it was a little too strong

00:24:07.460 --> 00:24:08.460
before.

00:24:08.460 --> 00:24:09.460
I've knocked out a lot of that.

00:24:09.460 --> 00:24:11.130
I've lightened up this foreground.

00:24:11.130 --> 00:24:13.850
I'm now going to do the opposite to the upper
register of the painting.

00:24:13.850 --> 00:24:18.840
I'm going to deepen this space, this kind
of empty dark space around this still life

00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:19.840
here.

00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:22.450
And, again, I'm going to knock out these Naples
yellows, but I'm going to push them back a

00:24:22.450 --> 00:24:39.200
little bit rather than pulling them forward.

00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:45.810
All right.

00:24:45.810 --> 00:24:53.039
So the space is starting to push back a little
bit at the top and come forward a little bit

00:24:53.039 --> 00:24:54.429
at the bottom like I was hoping for.

00:24:54.429 --> 00:24:57.669
However, predictably, I've lost the grid again,
so I'm going to go back and reinforce those

00:24:57.669 --> 00:25:06.299
lines once more.

00:25:06.299 --> 00:25:14.730
All right.

00:25:14.730 --> 00:25:16.770
Things are starting to come together nicely
here.

00:25:16.770 --> 00:25:18.610
A couple things are sticking in my eye.

00:25:18.610 --> 00:25:22.350
Again, I have a little bit too much of that
Naples yellow peeking through although one

00:25:22.350 --> 00:25:26.419
of them is the label of the wine bottle, which
is rather close to that color and lightened

00:25:26.419 --> 00:25:28.710
up a little bit.

00:25:28.710 --> 00:25:33.970
Also, the textures in here are not as refined
as what's going on around the edges.

00:25:33.970 --> 00:25:36.179
I haven't spent as much time on them, in other
words.

00:25:36.179 --> 00:25:40.010
So if you come in and look here, you see there's
this nice feathery touch, right?

00:25:40.010 --> 00:25:44.050
So all these little chattery brush strokes
are quite small and vibrating up against each

00:25:44.050 --> 00:25:45.050
other.

00:25:45.050 --> 00:25:49.130
Contrast that with some rather flatly painted
areas, like this black is a little chunky

00:25:49.130 --> 00:25:52.230
in here, this red is a little bit chunky as
well.

00:25:52.230 --> 00:25:55.620
So I'm going to switch to a smaller brush
and get some of that chatter and quality back

00:25:55.620 --> 00:25:57.780
that you see in some areas, but not other
ones.

00:25:57.780 --> 00:26:01.059
By the way, this is how a lot of paintings
work, right?

00:26:01.059 --> 00:26:04.560
When you strengthen one area of the painting,
other areas that didn't seem like they were

00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:17.510
a problem before suddenly look weak in comparison
and need to be corrected.

00:26:17.510 --> 00:26:36.690
All right.

00:26:36.690 --> 00:26:39.760
Things coming along rather nicely here, I
think.

00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:43.110
One thing you might notice here, it's a subtle
one, but it's an interesting game that Braque,

00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:47.909
and Picasso, and other Cubist artists used,
these lines this last time they're not black.

00:26:47.909 --> 00:26:52.830
They're black with a lot of amber mixed in,
so they have a little bit of kind of a dark

00:26:52.830 --> 00:26:57.980
burgundy, yeah, I got wine on the mind, I
guess, color here, which gives it a nice,

00:26:57.980 --> 00:27:00.550
you know, rhyme, if you will, with some of
the black.

00:27:00.550 --> 00:27:06.140
Just a little bit more optical into it and
a little bit more food for the eye, so to

00:27:06.140 --> 00:27:07.140
speak.

00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:09.289
What I'm going to do now is take care of the
edges a little bit.

00:27:09.289 --> 00:27:11.090
You might say, "Well, what's wrong with the
edges?

00:27:11.090 --> 00:27:13.400
They're so nicely painted areas, the edges."

00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:18.760
I think so, but I think what I'd like to have
happen is really to start focusing more on

00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:22.919
the still life and less on the space around
it, both the foreground and the background.

00:27:22.919 --> 00:27:27.400
So the way I'm going to go about doing that
is literally to remove some paint from around

00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:28.400
the edges.

00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:32.650
Now, to do that I'm just going to use the
rag that I've been working with here.

00:27:32.650 --> 00:27:37.760
I'm going to get it a little bit damp with
turpentine, doesn't need much, and then I'm

00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:48.100
going to start scrubbing a little bit around
the edges.

00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:55.640
Okay.

00:27:55.640 --> 00:28:01.450
So a subtle effect, but I've started to blur,
and blend, and weaken, and fade, etc., around

00:28:01.450 --> 00:28:05.710
the edges, which I think does focus our eyes'
attention back on the center of the work a

00:28:05.710 --> 00:28:06.710
little bit.

00:28:06.710 --> 00:28:09.039
I wanna shift gears back to the center of
the work now.

00:28:09.039 --> 00:28:12.200
I'm going to add a little bit more light,
a little bit more space, a little bit more

00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:24.850
white back into the work, and then I'm going
to add a couple blue bits.

00:28:24.850 --> 00:28:29.690
Okay.

00:28:29.690 --> 00:28:45.520
Let's see what a little blue does.

00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:50.330
So kind of a playful idea summarizing the
kind of polka dot pattern there.

00:28:50.330 --> 00:28:54.620
Braque and Picasso, for all the seriousness
and the gravity of Cubism, all the braininess

00:28:54.620 --> 00:28:58.480
and the several qualities, they always had
a sense of humor, sticking in these little

00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:03.029
visual jokes like this, polka dots that are
totally flat where they don't belong.

00:29:03.029 --> 00:29:07.480
Of course, if I'm trying to paint this perspectivally,
it's going to be rolling every way, and those

00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:09.220
dots are not even dots to begin with.

00:29:09.220 --> 00:29:11.549
They're all kind of organic shapes, anyway.

00:29:11.549 --> 00:29:16.750
But I've just kind of superimposed them very
childlike, very playfully over just a couple

00:29:16.750 --> 00:29:17.750
zones.

00:29:17.750 --> 00:29:20.860
Maybe I'll add a couple more, but let me hold
that thought for now.

00:29:20.860 --> 00:29:40.150
I'm now going to reinforce the black lines
around those again.

00:29:40.150 --> 00:29:43.460
So getting pretty close to stopping point
here.

00:29:43.460 --> 00:29:45.470
Now, again, this is an oil painting.

00:29:45.470 --> 00:29:48.440
It's nice always to work wet over dry.

00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:54.230
You know, this kinda paint is going to take
three, four days to dry, so always nice to

00:29:54.230 --> 00:29:58.630
have that extra recourse to additional painting
that oil paint affords.

00:29:58.630 --> 00:30:05.049
But some of the things that you can see that
I've done here are to really accentuate the

00:30:05.049 --> 00:30:09.990
center of the painting here, not only with
these design motifs, these polka dots, etc.

00:30:09.990 --> 00:30:14.400
The strongest colors we have in the painting
are towards the center, but to make it related

00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:18.480
to everything else, I've brought some of that
blue out and brought it just a hint of it

00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:21.460
here, and a hint of it here, a hint of it
down here.

00:30:21.460 --> 00:30:27.559
This red which you see coming from the apple
and also the orangey, you know, planter is

00:30:27.559 --> 00:30:34.430
also mirrored up here in the cover for the
cork of the wine, a little bit of the reflectance

00:30:34.430 --> 00:30:35.659
here in the glass.

00:30:35.659 --> 00:30:39.980
So it's nice to bring these elements elsewhere
in the painting to really make the center,

00:30:39.980 --> 00:30:43.100
make the subject related to everything else
in the painting.

00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:44.600
So we have this kind of balance.

00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:47.020
We're not really center-heavy here.

00:30:47.020 --> 00:30:51.890
The center of gravity is not really anchored
in the center, because it is distributed elsewhere.

00:30:51.890 --> 00:30:55.910
Then, again, the center does have a little
bit more density of the lines.

00:30:55.910 --> 00:31:00.480
You know, the shapes, the shards, if you will,
are much smaller, much tighter.

00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:04.909
So there is something pulling your eye down
here, which, guess what, is right in the center

00:31:04.909 --> 00:31:06.580
of the still life.

00:31:06.580 --> 00:31:10.960
I'm just putting a couple of touches on here,
you know, just to give a little bit more interest

00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:16.440
to some passages that maybe aren't as interesting
as others here.

00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:20.950
And as you've definitely seen by now in this
video, this kind of painting, this kind of

00:31:20.950 --> 00:31:24.580
analytical Cubism is all about fussing, right?

00:31:24.580 --> 00:31:29.991
So it's about looking and adjusting, etc.,
composing, but then about fussing with every

00:31:29.991 --> 00:31:32.370
little brushstroke, every little texture,
etc.

00:31:32.370 --> 00:31:35.780
So, as you saw in the beginning of this painting,
I was doing a whole lot of looking at the

00:31:35.780 --> 00:31:37.470
still life itself.

00:31:37.470 --> 00:31:42.289
As the painting grows, as it lives, you start
looking a lot more at the painting itself,

00:31:42.289 --> 00:31:45.049
what does it need, not what does the still
life need.

00:31:45.049 --> 00:31:47.429
It's already really fulfilled its role.

00:31:47.429 --> 00:31:51.220
In fact, turning our back on the still life,
as you've seen me do a couple times in the

00:31:51.220 --> 00:31:56.610
video, is something that Braque and Picasso
did increasingly in 1910, 1911 as they're

00:31:56.610 --> 00:32:02.039
moving forward towards that next huge essential
jump from analytical Cubism, as I've been

00:32:02.039 --> 00:32:07.020
working in the style of today, to synthetic
Cubism, where no longer is a still life even

00:32:07.020 --> 00:32:11.630
necessary to look at to actually compose one,
or better said, to create one.

00:32:11.630 --> 00:32:15.740
Interesting to note that for all the radical
painting that Braque and Picasso did, all

00:32:15.740 --> 00:32:19.890
the experiments, all the innovation of Cubism
between the two of them they never made a

00:32:19.890 --> 00:32:21.300
single abstract painting.

00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:26.610
They came this close, but they let a horde
of other painters, really their followers,

00:32:26.610 --> 00:32:28.510
many of them take that plunge into abstraction.

00:32:28.510 --> 00:32:30.690
