00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 align:start position:0%
the whole idea of where fatigue is is
 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.660 align:start position:0%
the whole idea of where fatigue is is
really<00:00:48.230><c> disturbing</c><00:00:49.230><c> I</c><00:00:49.559><c> mean</c><00:00:49.800><c> we</c><00:00:50.010><c> the</c><00:00:50.219><c> least</c><00:00:50.489><c> we</c>

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 align:start position:0%
really disturbing I mean we the least we
 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.740 align:start position:0%
really disturbing I mean we the least we
can<00:00:50.789><c> do</c><00:00:51.000><c> is</c><00:00:51.079><c> continue</c><00:00:52.079><c> to</c><00:00:52.760><c> absorb</c><00:00:53.760><c> and</c><00:00:54.180><c> the</c>

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 align:start position:0%
can do is continue to absorb and the
 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.630 align:start position:0%
can do is continue to absorb and the
information<00:00:55.170><c> about</c><00:00:55.860><c> what's</c><00:00:56.190><c> what's</c>

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 align:start position:0%
information about what's what's
 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.920 align:start position:0%
information about what's what's
happening<00:00:57.710><c> but</c><00:00:58.730><c> so</c><00:00:59.730><c> I</c><00:00:59.760><c> think</c><00:01:00.059><c> it's</c><00:01:00.239><c> I</c><00:01:00.660><c> think</c>

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 align:start position:0%
happening but so I think it's I think
 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.850 align:start position:0%
happening but so I think it's I think
it's<00:01:01.230><c> media</c><00:01:01.559><c> and</c><00:01:01.710><c> it's</c><00:01:01.829><c> also</c><00:01:02.989><c> an</c><00:01:03.989><c> individual's</c>

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 align:start position:0%
it's media and it's also an individual's
 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:12.740 align:start position:0%
it's media and it's also an individual's
