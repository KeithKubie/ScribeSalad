00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.510
Performance and
speed is something that user love.

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.310
In order for
us to see what our performance is,

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:09.350
we need to look at the speed report.

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:16.500
Speed reports show us how different
request took in our app or site.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.190
You may want to track how quickly the
screens for each new level of the game

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:25.370
load, or how fast search result have
been brought back to the user's page.

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:29.080
You could also toggle between
different version of this report, and

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:34.020
I'll show you what to gain from the
distribution, and the overlay reports.

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.430
By the way, this report is important
enough to be taken to the dashboard so

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.170
you can face it on a daily basis.

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.870
In my last startup,
we also sent it on a weekly basis.

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.580
So we could see if and
how we improving after each new version.

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:56.300
The main metrics that you gain from
this reports is definitely to see

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.560
what is the average load
time of each and every page.

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:02.960
And here you can see that I
definitely had a problem with my site

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.870
at the beginning of last May.

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.340
When we clicking on
the Distribution tab of this page,

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.940
we could definitely see what is going
on in different buckets, and that could

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:18.440
help us a lot to identify problematic
sections or buckets in our site.

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:25.500
Another very important aspect of this
report is to go to the Map Overlay.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.310
It's important because
we want to see how

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:33.650
different users around the globe
are using and leveraging our site.

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:39.030
What is the global distribution,
let's say of the average user timing?

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.290
We could see here that the darker
shades indicates longer load time.

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:47.220
This report can show if your app or

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.650
site experience got any issues on
particular geographic regions.

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:55.830
It's especially important
if you are using CDNs or

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.530
stream content that depends on
a geolocation of your users.

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.460
Here for instance, you can see that
I clearly got some problems in Chile.

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.820
And luckily in the States and Canada,

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:15.020
and over Europe,
I'm quite in a good position.
