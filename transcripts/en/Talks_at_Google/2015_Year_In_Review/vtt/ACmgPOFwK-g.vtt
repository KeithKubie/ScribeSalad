00:00:03.344 --> 00:00:04.510
KEVIN BELK: Hello, everyone.

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:05.360
Welcome to Talks at Google.

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:06.039
I'm Kevin Belk.

00:00:06.039 --> 00:00:07.330
SAVVI NEWTON: I'm Savii Newton.

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:10.161
And I would like to introduce
my role model, Bethany Hamilton.

00:00:10.161 --> 00:00:11.574
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:19.121 --> 00:00:20.120
KEVIN BELK: How are you?

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:21.371
SAVVI NEWTON: Aloha, everyone!

00:00:21.371 --> 00:00:22.120
KEVIN BELK: Aloha.

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:23.280
I should have-- dang it.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:24.590
You beat me to it.

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:25.820
So welcome, welcome.

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:27.214
And congrats on being a new mom!

00:00:27.214 --> 00:00:28.380
BETHANY HAMILTON: Thank you!

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.046
KEVIN BELK: So--

00:00:29.046 --> 00:00:30.336
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:34.090
How has that been?

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:36.190
BETHANY HAMILTON:
It's been a whirlwind.

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:39.540
My husband, Adam, and
I, we have a little guy.

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:40.970
His name's Tobias.

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:43.700
And he's about four and
a half months old now.

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.210
And I would say the
first two months

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.640
was like the most challenging
time of our lives ever.

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.500
But now it's going awesome.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.905
I love being a mom.

00:00:53.905 --> 00:00:55.932
It's just the best thing ever.

00:00:55.932 --> 00:00:58.390
KEVIN BELK: How have you been
able to balance that and work

00:00:58.390 --> 00:00:59.660
and surfing and everything?

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:02.201
BETHANY HAMILTON: Yeah, I guess
we have a really unique life.

00:01:02.201 --> 00:01:04.950
And we kind of dabble in a
bunch of different areas,

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:07.800
from surfing to a lot of travel.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.710
And right now I'm on
the start of a speaking

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.670
tour around America.

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.650
So it's definitely a big balance
bringing our little guy along.

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.430
But thankfully, we can do
it together as a family.

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.610
And yeah, we just make
it work and bring Tobias

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.264
into our lives and our world.

00:01:28.264 --> 00:01:30.680
KEVIN BELK: And you started
surfing at a really young age.

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.096
So can you talk
about what got you

00:01:32.096 --> 00:01:34.460
into surfing and any kind of
family influences or friend

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:35.140
influences?

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:36.098
BETHANY HAMILTON: Yeah.

00:01:36.098 --> 00:01:39.790
So I probably was on a
surfboard before I could walk.

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:44.490
And I know that my
passion began very young.

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.250
And I'm still incredibly
passionate about surfing today.

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.590
But I guess growing
up in Hawaii,

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.220
it's kind of the perfect
spot to take on surfing.

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.880
And everyone in
my family surfed.

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.045
Both my mom and dad moved out
to Hawaii in the early 70s, kind

00:02:01.045 --> 00:02:05.170
of nomad hippies
chasing their dream

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.680
to live a simple life
in Hawaii and spend

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.180
as much time in the
ocean as they could.

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:16.050
So eventually they taught
my two older brothers and I

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.840
how to sew.

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.210
And at a young
age, they could see

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:22.490
that I had a natural passion
and talent for surfing.

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.650
And I just kind of stuck to it.

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.010
And that was the
start of something

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.320
that I knew I'd do forever.

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:32.520
KEVIN BELK: It's amazing.

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.569
And so what other passions
do you have, besides surfing?

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:38.985
BETHANY HAMILTON: Yeah, I have
so many different passions.

00:02:38.985 --> 00:02:43.740
But I'm definitely a
healthy-living sort of girl.

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:47.390
And I love just eating healthy.

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.630
So we'll cook a lot
of our own food.

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:54.740
And it's awesome, in Hawaii
there's a lot of local produce

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:59.020
available and a lot of
organic produce at reach

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:00.570
that is just amazing.

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:04.420
And what else.

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.280
I love just staying active.

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.870
I have lot of different hobbies.

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:09.660
It's hard to get
to them, but I love

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.570
just playing tennis and hanging
at the beach with family

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:13.400
and friends.

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.422
And I like reading.

00:03:17.422 --> 00:03:19.380
KEVIN BELK: And you're
just like everyone else.

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:20.430
Look at that.

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.300
And you surf awesomely, too.

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:24.050
BETHANY HAMILTON: I surf a lot.

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:26.290
When we get home from
this trip in November,

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.360
it's the start of Hawaii's
winter season, which

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.290
is the best time for surfing.

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.260
So I'll be in the water a lot.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.200
And I also enjoy
public speaking.

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.620
It's a huge passion
of mine now, and I

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.190
have such an awesome
audience of young people.

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:42.600
And I love being able
to influence them

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.610
in good directions, to just
think about their decisions.

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:48.774
So that's another area
of passion of mine.

00:03:48.774 --> 00:03:50.190
KEVIN BELK: And
you have your book

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:51.523
from last year, "Body and Soul."

00:03:51.523 --> 00:03:54.560
Can you talk about what inspired
that and just the development

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:55.590
process of that?

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:56.548
BETHANY HAMILTON: Yeah.

00:03:56.548 --> 00:03:59.250
So I had the pleasure of
writing another book called

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:00.260
"Body and Soul."

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.670
And my hope with
"Body and Soul" is

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:04.940
to encourage,
especially young girls

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:09.025
because I end up
talking and hanging out

00:04:09.025 --> 00:04:10.130
with young girls a lot.

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:14.250
So I wanted to encourage
girls in their health

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:18.630
and their overall journey
through those teenage years,

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:21.420
which can be really tough.

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:24.160
So with the book, I was
kind of encouraging girls

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.610
to think about what they
eat, how they move their body

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:32.240
in healthy ways-- talking
from not just working

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.640
out, but posture
and finding things

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:38.790
that they like to
do to stay active.

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:41.430
And then, from there,
also encouraging them

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:45.960
in their faith in God and just
their mental approach on a day

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:47.900
to day basis.

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:49.230
Just live thankfully.

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:53.085
And I found so much.

00:04:53.085 --> 00:04:57.200
I meet a lot of girls
in everything that I do.

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:59.880
And a lot of girls struggle
with their body image.

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:02.760
So I really wanted
to encourage them

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:06.720
to focus on being healthy
rather than getting caught up

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:10.600
in eating disorders or just
different struggles of the way

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:13.870
they view themselves and where
they place their identity.

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:18.570
And it's not so much their
physical, outer look but just

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:21.010
everything that they
are-- the different things

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:24.400
that they're passionate about
and that they're talented.

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:26.370
And yeah.

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:30.970
So it's been a lot of fun to
have a book in that area, which

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:34.660
there's not a lot of information
for girls in the teenage years

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:38.542
that is very accessible
and user friendly.

00:05:38.542 --> 00:05:39.250
KEVIN BELK: Yeah.

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:41.416
I love when you said "posture"
everyone in this room

00:05:41.416 --> 00:05:43.220
just went-- you know?

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:43.820
Even me.

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:45.701
I'm like, all right,
stuck in the gut.

00:05:45.701 --> 00:05:47.450
BETHANY HAMILTON:
Posture is so important!

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:49.260
It affects your overall health.

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.080
And people don't realize that.

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:53.942
You think of it as more of like,
oh, my mom told me to sit up,

00:05:53.942 --> 00:05:54.900
so I'm going to set up.

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:57.210
But then like 15
minutes later you're

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:00.462
hanging over the
side of your chair.

00:06:00.462 --> 00:06:01.920
KEVIN BELK: So
after your incident,

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:03.840
what was the toughest
thing to realize?

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:04.800
OK, I'm going to
keep doing this.

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:06.966
So what was the toughest
thing to get right and find

00:06:06.966 --> 00:06:09.640
that better balance to
get back on the board?

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:10.610
BETHANY HAMILTON: Yeah.

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:13.420
After losing my arm--
I was 13 years old when

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:14.890
I lost my arm to a shark.

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:20.100
And I think, at the time,
when it initially happened,

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:22.420
I thought I had lost much
more than just my arm.

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:24.710
I thought I had lost surfing.

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:27.390
And I didn't know what my
future was going to hold.

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:33.260
And everything felt really
unknown and kind of scary.

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.800
I just didn't know
what was possible.

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:38.820
Thankfully, I had
an amazing community

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:42.210
of people there to
support and encourage me.

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:44.690
First of all, I had
my faith in God.

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:48.200
It reminded me that, hey, God
has a future for your life.

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:49.940
And He has a plan for you.

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:52.730
And He's going to help
you get through this.

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:55.460
And He certainly did.

00:06:55.460 --> 00:07:01.520
And also I got to talk to
another fellow amputee, which

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:02.690
was huge for me.

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:06.640
And he had lost
his leg to a shark.

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:08.870
And then he continued
surfing-- or he actually

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:10.880
learned how to
surf with one leg.

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:14.060
And that was my first light
bulbs switch, like, wow,

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:15.510
maybe I can surf with one arm.

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:18.540
So before I even got out of
the hospital, which was less

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:20.790
than a week, I was
already planning

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:24.520
to try surfing with
one arm and basically

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:26.590
just waiting for the
doctor to allow me back

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:28.980
in the ocean after healing.

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:32.800
And so my journey kind of
began less than a month later.

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:34.400
I got back on my board.

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:39.310
And I remember my first time
paddling out with one arm.

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:41.350
It just felt so
awkward and weird.

00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:45.190
And my dad's right there.

00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:48.710
I kind of fell on my
first wave, and he's like,

00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:49.710
here, let me help you.

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:51.725
And I was little
miss independent.

00:07:51.725 --> 00:07:52.810
I'm like, no, Dad!

00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:54.050
Stay away!

00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:55.369
But he did help me verbally.

00:07:55.369 --> 00:07:57.160
KEVIN BELK: Typical
13-year-old girl, yeah.

00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:58.250
BETHANY HAMILTON: Yeah,
verbally he helped me.

00:07:58.250 --> 00:08:00.750
He was like, try to put your
hand in the center of the board

00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:03.420
because normally, with two arms,
you put both hands on the side

00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:05.570
when you pop up to ride waves.

00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:08.250
So instead, putting my one hand
in the middle of the board.

00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:11.310
So my third try,
I popped right up

00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:14.180
and rode the wave all the
way to the beach and just

00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:18.310
had tears of joy, and
was so excited to be

00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:19.930
doing what I love to do.

00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:24.660
And long story short, today
I'm a professional surfer.

00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:29.166
And it's what I love to do.

00:08:29.166 --> 00:08:30.958
[APPLAUSE]

00:08:33.189 --> 00:08:34.980
KEVIN BELK: And then
you had "Soul Surfer,"

00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:39.150
which is a book that you had
written pretty much a year

00:08:39.150 --> 00:08:40.004
right after.

00:08:40.004 --> 00:08:40.990
It was 2004.

00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:42.774
And then it was
turned to a movie.

00:08:42.774 --> 00:08:44.940
So what was your involvement
with not only the book,

00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:47.440
but turning it into the movie
and the process of that?

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:49.160
Because that came out-- I think
the movie came out in 2011,

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:49.670
right?

00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:50.628
BETHANY HAMILTON: Yeah.

00:08:50.628 --> 00:08:53.270
So "Soul Surfer," the
book, released in 2004.

00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:56.110
And I was involved.

00:08:56.110 --> 00:08:58.410
I was also a very
distracted teenager.

00:08:58.410 --> 00:09:03.032
So the ghost writer had
to work with me a lot.

00:09:03.032 --> 00:09:04.714
I would go surf and
then talk with him

00:09:04.714 --> 00:09:07.130
and then go do something and
then talk with him some more.

00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:10.013
And I know it was a
long process for him,

00:09:10.013 --> 00:09:12.100
but thank goodness
we got through it.

00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:16.650
And, eventually, "Soul
Surfer" the movie

00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:17.960
started coming together.

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:21.860
It was a long process, probably
about four or five years.

00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:25.030
And my whole family and
I were very involved.

00:09:25.030 --> 00:09:27.590
My brother and sister-in-law
were co-producers.

00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:31.710
And we all had some say
in the script writing,

00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:33.500
just trying to make
it our own voice

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:37.620
and make it more true
to us as a family.

00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:40.680
And I guess, growing
up in Hawaii,

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:42.420
we really didn't know
what we were doing.

00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:44.100
But at the same time,
we did our best.

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:47.160
And I love the
director, Sean McNamara.

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:50.510
He was very open to my feedback.

00:09:50.510 --> 00:09:53.310
So anytime I could
go and talk to him.

00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:58.120
So one day I was on set and they
were filming a church scene.

00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:02.750
My family and I grew
up going to church.

00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:05.270
And they were filming
this church scene.

00:10:05.270 --> 00:10:07.600
It literally looked like
everyone was at a funeral.

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:08.370
So I go on set.

00:10:08.370 --> 00:10:09.370
I'm like, hey, everyone.

00:10:09.370 --> 00:10:11.250
If you could just do
me a favor, pretend

00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:12.250
you're not at a funeral.

00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:12.958
You're at church.

00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:16.660
And I personally am really
stoked when I'm at church.

00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:19.840
So at least pretend
you are while you're

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:22.240
doing your job of acting.

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:27.670
And so I had a lot of fun just
bouncing to and from on set.

00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:30.240
And I even got to go
into the editing room

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:33.054
and have a say here and
there on different scenes,

00:10:33.054 --> 00:10:33.970
like the shark attack.

00:10:33.970 --> 00:10:36.774
I remember they initially
made it like a "Jaws" scene.

00:10:36.774 --> 00:10:37.565
And I was like, no.

00:10:37.565 --> 00:10:39.340
This Is way too scary.

00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:42.170
Parents are not going to allow
their kids to watch this.

00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:45.050
And in actuality,
it was really quick.

00:10:45.050 --> 00:10:47.500
And I didn't even see the shark.

00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:51.400
So let's keep it quick,
short and-- not so sweet,

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:52.741
but short and sweet.

00:10:52.741 --> 00:10:54.184
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:54.810 --> 00:10:56.810
KEVIN BELK: And, I mean,
you've done everything.

00:10:56.810 --> 00:10:59.995
You've done, obviously, a book,
a movie, surfing, and stuff.

00:10:59.995 --> 00:11:01.620
But you also were in
"The Amazing Race"

00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:02.690
with your husband, Adam.

00:11:02.690 --> 00:11:04.730
And so can you talk about that?

00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:05.870
You guys finished third.

00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:08.630
And just that
incredible, I mean--

00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:10.755
BETHANY HAMILTON: You just
spoiled it for everyone.

00:11:10.755 --> 00:11:12.150
KEVIN BELK: Oh, no!

00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:15.360
Wikipedia spoiled it for me.

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:16.550
Watch your TV shows.

00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:17.762
Come on, people!

00:11:17.762 --> 00:11:19.120
No, but you did that with Adam.

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:21.310
So can you talk
about just-- I mean,

00:11:21.310 --> 00:11:23.460
that must have been an
incredible experience.

00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:25.209
BETHANY HAMILTON: Yeah.
"The Amazing Race"

00:11:25.209 --> 00:11:27.630
was kind of our second
honeymoon, in a sense.

00:11:27.630 --> 00:11:31.430
We got married the August
before we did the race.

00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:36.000
And we raced that next June.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.690
And it was a lot of fun.

00:11:37.690 --> 00:11:42.540
It was not easy, but we
went into the first leg

00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:44.815
just planning not to get lost.

00:11:44.815 --> 00:11:47.076
Just make it through
the first leg.

00:11:47.076 --> 00:11:50.440
And lo and behold, we slowly
made it through each leg.

00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:54.310
And some of our favorite
legs-- the second leg,

00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:55.190
we went to England.

00:11:55.190 --> 00:11:58.430
And we got to run around a race
track in less than a minute

00:11:58.430 --> 00:12:01.280
and 15 seconds while
flipping pancakes

00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:02.790
and keeping up your speed.

00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:05.250
And we nailed it
in our first shot

00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:07.650
and then went on
and ended up winning

00:12:07.650 --> 00:12:09.060
the leg, which was awesome.

00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:10.870
So that kind of
built our confidence

00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:12.200
early on in the race.

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:14.280
Though anything can
happen at any moment,

00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:16.000
like a bad taxi driver.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.280
Or you just really screw
up on your directions

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:21.790
without your iPhone.

00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:23.390
Everyone here, I
am sure you rely

00:12:23.390 --> 00:12:26.190
on your iPhone for your
directions-- or whatever phone.

00:12:26.190 --> 00:12:27.023
KEVIN BELK: Android.

00:12:27.023 --> 00:12:28.326
Android.

00:12:28.326 --> 00:12:29.160
Android.

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:30.701
BETHANY HAMILTON:
Sorry, the Android!

00:12:30.701 --> 00:12:31.690
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:31.690 --> 00:12:34.480
Yeah, your Androids
are very important.

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:37.448
KEVIN BELK: Just be
like, iPhone, Android.

00:12:37.448 --> 00:12:39.920
We'll edit that part.

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:43.740
BETHANY HAMILTON: So we
rely on our brains and a map

00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:44.880
to get us around.

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:47.810
And there was a lot of lost
moments throughout the race.

00:12:47.810 --> 00:12:52.430
But we ended up racing on to
the finals, which was awesome.

00:12:52.430 --> 00:12:56.000
And it came down to
the last challenge.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.210
I had to do it, no
matter what, because Adam

00:12:58.210 --> 00:13:00.390
had done the challenge before.

00:13:00.390 --> 00:13:05.350
And we're basically running
around this maze of shipping

00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:09.030
containers, looking
for different cities

00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:10.140
that we had been to.

00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:13.270
And each city came
with a number.

00:13:13.270 --> 00:13:14.670
And you're trying
to memorize it.

00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:16.378
And then you have to
put it all in order.

00:13:16.378 --> 00:13:19.840
And I got to that challenge
15 minutes through.

00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:22.210
And I was like, OK, my goal
is just to finish this.

00:13:22.210 --> 00:13:25.860
I want to finish this whole
entire race on a positive note.

00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:28.700
It's not necessarily about
winning at this point

00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:30.710
because I am not
good with memory.

00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:32.910
So I did finish.

00:13:32.910 --> 00:13:35.330
And we finished third and
we were really stoked.

00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:37.120
KEVIN BELK: That's so cool.

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:39.670
And so what was the most
difficult challenge in all

00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:41.830
of that, other than not
relying on technology,

00:13:41.830 --> 00:13:43.250
and the variables and stuff?

00:13:43.250 --> 00:13:45.080
BETHANY HAMILTON: Yeah.

00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:46.920
I don't know about
the most difficult.

00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:49.530
But one of my most
memorable challenges,

00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:52.710
where I got really
dirty, I was in Morocco.

00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:58.990
And each leg either Adam or I
have to do a different task.

00:13:58.990 --> 00:14:01.420
And then sometimes we're
together doing tasks.

00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:03.230
So we're in Morocco
and I decided

00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:08.770
to do skinning the goat
hair off the goat skin.

00:14:08.770 --> 00:14:12.400
And we walk into this big area
about the size of this room

00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:14.580
and there's just goat
skins everywhere.

00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:17.070
And I had to skin the
hair off the goat skin.

00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:17.840
And it stank.

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:22.120
And I'm wearing special gloves
and just getting really dirty.

00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:26.420
And I'm trying to skin the
goat hair off the skin.

00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:29.530
And then we had to take
the dried goat skin

00:14:29.530 --> 00:14:32.450
and bike it around
through the tiny streets

00:14:32.450 --> 00:14:36.690
and navigate your way to
wherever it needed to go.

00:14:36.690 --> 00:14:37.770
It was chaos.

00:14:37.770 --> 00:14:43.510
But it was really
fun, crazy memories

00:14:43.510 --> 00:14:46.859
that you wouldn't do on a
normal, day-to-day basis.

00:14:46.859 --> 00:14:48.900
KEVIN BELK: Like flipping
pancakes while running.

00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:49.240
BETHANY HAMILTON: Yeah,
flipping pancakes.

00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:51.810
KEVIN BELK: I clearly
do that all the time.

00:14:51.810 --> 00:14:55.120
So what advice do you
have for younger people,

00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:56.650
but even adults too?

00:14:56.650 --> 00:14:58.030
BETHANY HAMILTON: Yeah.

00:14:58.030 --> 00:14:59.850
There's so many
times in life-- we

00:14:59.850 --> 00:15:02.690
all go through different
challenges and struggles.

00:15:02.690 --> 00:15:07.630
And I found, in my life, I've
hugely relied on the things

00:15:07.630 --> 00:15:11.360
that I'm passionate about
to overcome and give me

00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:14.650
motivation and hope
that there's a future

00:15:14.650 --> 00:15:17.460
beyond this momentary
struggle and this pain

00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:19.180
that we're going through.

00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:23.560
And for me it's been my
faith in God and surfing.

00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:28.070
And these two things I'm
so incredibly grateful for.

00:15:28.070 --> 00:15:31.070
First, knowing how much God
loves me and the grace He

00:15:31.070 --> 00:15:32.510
has in my life.

00:15:32.510 --> 00:15:36.200
And just being able
to be in the ocean

00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:40.810
and do what I love and work
towards that has helped

00:15:40.810 --> 00:15:42.170
me overcome so much.

00:15:42.170 --> 00:15:46.550
And it just leaves us to be
thankful for what we do have

00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:48.500
rather than what we don't have.

00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:53.604
And also just clinging
to your community

00:15:53.604 --> 00:15:55.270
of people that are
going to help you get

00:15:55.270 --> 00:15:58.610
through your hard times, too.

00:15:58.610 --> 00:16:00.705
KEVIN BELK: So you have
Friends of Bethany.

00:16:00.705 --> 00:16:02.580
Can you talk a little
bit about that as well?

00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:03.538
BETHANY HAMILTON: Yeah.

00:16:03.538 --> 00:16:05.970
Friends of Bethany is my
nonprofit organization.

00:16:05.970 --> 00:16:08.930
I have an awesome team of
people that help me with it.

00:16:08.930 --> 00:16:12.450
And, actually, I just came
from one of my favorite events

00:16:12.450 --> 00:16:15.060
that I get to be a
part of all year.

00:16:15.060 --> 00:16:17.860
It's a retreat
for amputee girls.

00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:20.580
And we basically hang out
for the weekend in Southern

00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:22.570
California, take
the girls surfing,

00:16:22.570 --> 00:16:24.380
encourage them through
their struggles.

00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:27.250
And all these girls have
their own different stories

00:16:27.250 --> 00:16:32.420
and different ways of
how they have overcome.

00:16:32.420 --> 00:16:36.040
And we, basically, leave them
with a life-changing weekend

00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:39.020
to remind them that they can
overcome different struggles

00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:39.750
in their lives.

00:16:39.750 --> 00:16:42.320
And it's really cool.

00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:45.450
We just kind of hang out at
some point in the weekend

00:16:45.450 --> 00:16:48.080
and talk about, how do you
put your hair up with one arm,

00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:50.960
and just simple things
like that that most of us

00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:53.050
wouldn't think about.

00:16:53.050 --> 00:16:55.330
So I love what I
get to be a part of.

00:16:55.330 --> 00:16:59.750
And we're also doing a lot of
youth events and teenage girl

00:16:59.750 --> 00:17:03.740
events and reaching out
to amputees as a whole.

00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:05.317
And it's a lot of fun.

00:17:05.317 --> 00:17:07.150
KEVIN BELK: And how can
people get involved?

00:17:07.150 --> 00:17:09.650
BETHANY HAMILTON: Yeah, just
check out friendsofbethany.com.

00:17:09.650 --> 00:17:14.089
And you'll get the
inside scoop there.

00:17:14.089 --> 00:17:17.630
KEVIN BELK: And so what's been
some of your favorite moments

00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:19.220
over the years?

00:17:19.220 --> 00:17:20.380
I mean, you have the book.

00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:22.004
You have the movie
and stuff like that,

00:17:22.004 --> 00:17:26.230
but over just the
past 12, 15 years?

00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:28.830
BETHANY HAMILTON: Well, I'd say
getting married was up there.

00:17:28.830 --> 00:17:30.250
I have an amazing husband.

00:17:30.250 --> 00:17:33.190
I'm so thankful
for him in my life.

00:17:33.190 --> 00:17:36.540
And then, now, having
our little guy Tobias

00:17:36.540 --> 00:17:38.990
is even-- it's so amazing.

00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:42.460
I'm just loving being a
mom and parents together.

00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:45.950
It's a very special thing that
I feel really grateful for.

00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:47.410
KEVIN BELK: Well, family seems
to be really important to you,

00:17:47.410 --> 00:17:47.909
as well.

00:17:47.909 --> 00:17:49.770
So do you have any
mentors or anyone

00:17:49.770 --> 00:17:52.260
who influenced you, even
before that incident

00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:53.580
and then just now?

00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:55.500
BETHANY HAMILTON: Yeah.

00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:58.020
I mean, my parents were
very involved in my life,

00:17:58.020 --> 00:18:00.490
which I'm very grateful
for because I know,

00:18:00.490 --> 00:18:02.990
as parents nowadays,
you can kind of

00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:04.620
get distracted
with your work life

00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:07.860
and neglect your
kids in a sense.

00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:09.500
Sorry to pull it out on parents.

00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:13.010
But my parents have been
so amazing in my life

00:18:13.010 --> 00:18:16.770
and so supportive in many
different ways-- my dad,

00:18:16.770 --> 00:18:19.660
cheering me on with surfing,
and my mom encouraging me

00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:23.353
so much in my faith in God.

00:18:23.353 --> 00:18:26.390
I also had some
really good friends,

00:18:26.390 --> 00:18:28.950
a solid group of
core girlfriends

00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:32.920
that made really healthy
decisions as teenagers

00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:36.267
and kind of kept
us on a good track.

00:18:36.267 --> 00:18:37.850
KEVIN BELK: How do
you set your goals?

00:18:37.850 --> 00:18:40.180
So is there anything
that you haven't done

00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:41.802
that you're like, I want to do?

00:18:41.802 --> 00:18:42.760
BETHANY HAMILTON: Yeah.

00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:45.790
Well I'm working on a film
project right now called

00:18:45.790 --> 00:18:47.100
"Surfs Like a Girl."

00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:50.220
And I have a lot of lofty
goals within that project

00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:54.080
because, in the action sports
world, you can kind of either

00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:57.480
be very focused on
competition or filmmaking.

00:18:57.480 --> 00:18:59.720
So I'm kind of veering
more towards filmmaking.

00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:01.890
So this is a film
I'm working on,

00:19:01.890 --> 00:19:04.970
highlighting a lot
of my surfing ability

00:19:04.970 --> 00:19:07.545
while encouraging
girls in their sport.

00:19:07.545 --> 00:19:10.340
But a lot of people know I
continued surfing with one arm,

00:19:10.340 --> 00:19:14.090
but they don't understand the
level of surfing that I have.

00:19:14.090 --> 00:19:16.480
And so I'm going to
just be surfing some

00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:17.810
of the best waves in the world.

00:19:17.810 --> 00:19:21.760
And I have some goals just
to perform really high.

00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:25.400
So when I'm home--
and on the road--

00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:28.260
I work, do different
things throughout the day,

00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:32.370
just keeping my body
in shape and watching

00:19:32.370 --> 00:19:35.930
other surfers who I appreciate
their way of approaching

00:19:35.930 --> 00:19:37.160
surfing.

00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:42.150
And also I got a trampoline
to elevate my surfing

00:19:42.150 --> 00:19:44.990
and get repetition on the
trampoline, which you can't

00:19:44.990 --> 00:19:46.350
get in the ocean, necessarily.

00:19:46.350 --> 00:19:49.690
So I think when you're reaching
towards different goals

00:19:49.690 --> 00:19:54.830
in your life, take little steps
towards the ultimate goal.

00:19:54.830 --> 00:19:57.190
Because I think, if you
think about the ultimate goal

00:19:57.190 --> 00:19:59.690
all the time, you
can get overwhelmed

00:19:59.690 --> 00:20:02.590
with how challenging it may
be and how daunting of a task

00:20:02.590 --> 00:20:03.970
it is.

00:20:03.970 --> 00:20:06.410
Just one little step at a time.

00:20:06.410 --> 00:20:08.580
KEVIN BELK: Where's your
favorite place to surf?

00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:10.038
BETHANY HAMILTON:
My favorite place

00:20:10.038 --> 00:20:15.680
to surf-- besides Hawaii,
I'm a Hawaii girl at heart.

00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:18.350
I love Tahiti, which is
very similar to Hawaii.

00:20:18.350 --> 00:20:20.940
Tahiti is like Hawaii
back in the days.

00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:23.280
And it's so gorgeous, and
the waves are amazing.

00:20:25.332 --> 00:20:27.540
KEVIN BELK: Well, thank you
so much for coming today.

00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:28.899
We really appreciate that.

00:20:28.899 --> 00:20:30.690
BETHANY HAMILTON:
Awesome, glad to be here!

00:20:30.690 --> 00:20:31.890
[APPLAUSE]
