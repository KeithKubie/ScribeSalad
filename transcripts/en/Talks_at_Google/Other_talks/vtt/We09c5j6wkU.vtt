00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:05.040
Mike Brazil: My name is Mike Brazil.
I'm an associate manager in finance operations

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.140
on Google Checkout.
And it's my pleasure to welcome Brett Johnson

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.490
today as part of our Leading@Google series.
For those of you who may not be familiar with

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:17.220
the series, it's designed to bring in experts
from around the world to help us learn about

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.590
leadership and how we can apply it to our
unique context here at Google.

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:22.551
Just to give you a little bit of background
on Brett.

00:00:22.551 --> 00:00:28.169
Brett Johnson is the founder and current president
of the Institute for Innovation, Integration

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:31.369
 &amp; Impact.
That's a Silicon Valley think tank that specializes

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:36.820
in aligning corporations behind a compelling
purpose that then drives innovation and results

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.960
in sustainable impact.
The Institute works with leaders and corporations

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.129
to discover their-- and implement personal
and corporate callings in order to have a

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:50.559
positive effect on society.
Previously, Brett was a partner at KPMG Peat

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:55.340
Marwick and Computer Sciences Corporation.
Before that, he spent 14 years at Price Waterhouse

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:00.429
working in United States and South Africa.
He has worked extensively with leaders around

00:01:00.429 --> 00:01:04.019
the world and is the author of "LEMON Leadership:
Radically Fresh Leadership," which he'll be

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.270
speaking about today.
His first book, "Convergence," looks at issues

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.430
of work/life balance and the integration of
all facets of life.

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:17.360
Brett coauthored "I-Operations: the Impact
of Internet on Operating Models" with Gary

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.450
Daichendt, the former EVP of Worldwide Operations
at Cisco Systems.

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.689
He also has a few handful of books in the
works.

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:31.840
When life gives you lemons, you write a book.
And he'll let us know more about his book.

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.000
I'd like to welcome Brett Johnson.
Thank you.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.000
[applause]

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.850
Brett Johnson: Thanks very much, Mike. Appreciate
the introduction.

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.509
Today, I'll be chatting with you a little
bit about LEMON Leadership.

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:51.090
And I will take questions at the end, although
I'm happy to be interrupted.

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.040
I was wondering, "What if there were more
than just two types of leaders?" [laughter]

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:02.700
And you can do the search yourself.
Some of you will be tempted to do it now.

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.039
But, the reality is, there are many descriptors
of leaders out there.

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:13.020
For years and years, I worked in executive
information systems starting about 30 years

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.620
ago.
And our challenge was to design systems that

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.940
were tailored to the way individual executives
were wired.

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:26.110
And so, we try to get inside their heads and
then figure out what would work for them and

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.140
wouldn't work.
But at the end of the day, when you went to

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:35.450
the body of literature that was out there,
you would have descriptors of "dogs" and "otters"

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.980
and, you know, "Labradors" and all sorts of
stuff like that.

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.140
And of course, the DISCs and the Myers-Briggs
stuff.

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:48.200
But, it all boiled down to two things: Managers
 -- this guy doesn't work at Google -- and

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:54.650
Entrepreneurs.
And occasionally, you might find a third category

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:00.650
of person, which was what we'd call a "Visionary."
And a "visionary" in Silicon Valley -- as

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:05.920
you know -- is basically somebody who has
great ideas, but when the company gets going,

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.010
you stick him in a corner office, you feed
them the food under the door, and you hope

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:16.870
that they don't come out and disrupt things.
So, you know, when you looked at the literature,

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:22.450
basically it was entrepreneurs and managers
is what you are left with.

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:27.930
But, in my dealings with leaders, I found
that that just wasn't enough in terms of the

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:32.910
categories of people.
So I began to do some research -- work with

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:38.100
people, understand their characteristics -- and
determined that there are actually five types

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.900
of leaders.
Now here, I'm not talking about styles.

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:46.180
I'm not talking about preferences.
I'm not talking about introvert or extrovert,

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.120
or whether they are direct or indirect -- concrete
or abstract.

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:55.130
I'm talking about how they're wired -- Leadership
DNA.

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:59.950
And my contention is that there are not just
two, but five styles.

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:05.960
"Luminaries" lead with ideas primarily.
They see the world through constructs of thinking

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:10.690
thoughts long-term.
"Entrepreneurs" are driven by opportunities.

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:15.930
And "Managers" are driven by policies, procedures,
systems, structure.

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:21.810
They understand organizational capital, whereas
the Luminaries understand intellectual capital,

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:28.010
and Entrepreneurs -- real, hard capital -- finances,
assets, and so on.

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:32.630
Then, you get "Organizers" and "Networkers,"
and I'll chat a little bit about those.

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:37.570
But these five types of leaders.
In each one of us is a combination of these

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:43.500
five slices of the lemon, if you like.
Now, I'll put your mind at rest -- for the

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:47.280
Managers in the room.
I was teaching this out of the university

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:51.000
in Hawaii many years ago.
And some guy came in the next day, and he

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:58.320
said "I have just one problem with your model."
I said, "What is it?" He said, "It should

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:04.130
be called MELON Leadership."
I said, "Let me guess -- you're a Manager,

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:08.870
right?" [laughter]
And, yeah. I'll explain why the Managers are

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:12.350
in the middle in a moment.
So it's LEMON Leadership -- not MELON Leadership,

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:16.720
not VENOM Leadership, as if we had Visionaries,
you know, instead of Luminaries.

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:21.160
But mostly, we'd be left with Entrepreneurs
and Managers.

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:27.180
And the sad part about that -- if you remember
the book, "The E-Myth" -- there are many people

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:29.530
who think they're Entrepreneurs, but they're
not.

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:34.830
So if you look in college campuses, about
75 percent of people at college campus say

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:38.460
they're going to start their own business,
and down into 30 percent do.

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:41.490
And so, "The E-Myth" says, "There's not that
many entrepreneurs."

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:44.960
In fact, you might be interested to know,
"What are the percentages?"

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:50.560
And you guys are pretty data-driven.
So, here's the results -- globally first -- and

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:54.810
then, I'll give you the Silicon Valley split,
as to what percentage we see out there based

00:05:54.810 --> 00:06:01.680
on thousands of assessments of Leaders.
So world population -- 9% are Luminaries.

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:06.590
When you get the combinations, like "What
percent are Luminary/Organizers?" for example

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:10.800
 -- primary Luminary, secondary Organizers
 -- the numbers will drop lower.

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:16.389
But 9% are Luminaries.
Then, about 14 percent only are Entrepreneurs

00:06:16.389 --> 00:06:20.710
 -- pretty small number.
Then, Managers are about 22 percent.

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:26.260
And Organizers -- 35 percent. And Networkers
 -- 20 percent.

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:31.450
The interesting thing about this is that,
in traditional leadership literature, we're

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:39.400
missing half of the pie.
Organizers and Networkers are not even classified

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:44.389
as Leaders usually.
So, we need to see why that's a problem.

00:06:44.389 --> 00:06:48.070
Here in Silicon Valley, we have slightly higher
percentage of Luminaries, [laughter] which

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:52.130
is good.
And then, we have not much difference in the

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:56.080
Entrepreneur quotient, which is quite interesting.
Of course, there's a confluence of factors

00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:00.600
here with the universities, venture capital,
and so on -- that cause the Entrepreneurs

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:05.190
to have a better likelihood of success than
if they were elsewhere in the world.

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:08.389
But the percentage-wise is not much different
 -- 1 percent different.

00:07:08.389 --> 00:07:15.100
We have a higher degree of Managers over here.
Fewer Organizers and a lower number of Networkers.

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:19.169
Those are the guys who are in New York calling
you at night when you're having your meal.

00:07:19.169 --> 00:07:23.210
That's where the Networkers are.
So, you might say, "We have more nerds than

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:29.600
nice guys" in Silicon Valley.
But, as the saying goes, "The geeks shall

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:33.200
inherit the earth."
So, that shouldn't be a problem.

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:37.100
So let's look at this a little bit more.
Of course, the issue is, "What do we do about

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:40.590
the missing percent?"
So, LEMON is fresh. It's a little bit different.

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:45.060
It's not about styles. It's not about what
your style is.

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:49.870
It's also not about your strengths and how
do you just make the most of your strengths

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:57.710
or your weaknesses and how to avoid your weaknesses.
It's also not about what you do under pressure.

00:07:57.710 --> 00:08:02.271
So LEMON Leadership is radically different,
and we'll get into a that in a moment.

00:08:02.271 --> 00:08:06.870
So firstly, throughout the book, we have these
LEMON truisms scattered.

00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:11.860
And one of them is that you lead from your
identity -- not from your function, not from

00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:15.730
your personality, not from your style so much,
or even your role.

00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:20.949
Although it is possible for your role to squeeze
you a particular way.

00:08:20.949 --> 00:08:26.040
I'll give you an example.
I was down the road at a semiconductor company,

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:34.310
shall we say, and most of the people in the
room -- directors, vice presidents -- indicated

00:08:34.310 --> 00:08:39.200
that the CEO was a Luminary/Entrepreneur,
which he was.

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:45.760
And they were paid just to do stuff.
They weren't paid to think, basically.

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:51.950
But when we got their LEMON assessments results
back, they had a smattering of people.

00:08:51.950 --> 00:08:58.070
And it took me about a half a day to convince
them that they could do more than just implement

00:08:58.070 --> 00:09:05.310
what the CEO thought about last night.
And so, sometimes our function -- or our role

00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:08.410
 -- will squeeze us into a particular way
of operating.

00:09:08.410 --> 00:09:14.900
But here's another truism -- "If you work
in a manner where who you are is consistent

00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:18.660
with how you're wired on an ongoing basis,
you'll burn out."

00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:22.960
So we have to watch out for that.
What I'm going to do is, there's a chapter

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:26.880
on each of these characteristics -- Luminaries,
Entrepreneurs -- and so on.

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:32.150
But I'm just going to give you a summary right
now of all five.

00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:36.200
And chat through those at just the high level.
This is just an abstract of some of the things

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:41.530
that are out of the book.
So first -- and this is by the way -- each

00:09:41.530 --> 00:09:46.160
of these on a good day.
Each of us has good days and bad days.

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:50.790
And here's a difference between LEMON Leadership
and other leadership stuff that I've read.

00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:57.000
If, for example, you're going with color coding
and you're a red leader, under pressure, you're

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.230
bright red.
You know, you're burning red.

00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:07.150
With LEMON Leadership, what I contend is that,
on a good day, you have the positive aspects

00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:13.750
 -- the strengths of your primary slice.
On a bad day, you will exhibit the negative

00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:18.680
characteristics, or the weaknesses of your
secondary slice.

00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:23.240
So these are the lemons on a good day.
And we'll look at them on a bad day in a moment.

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:31.100
So Luminaries -- they lead with ideas.
They have sayings like, "Ideas Have Consequences."

00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:35.260
There was a Chinese chap and a Frenchman on
a plane flying.

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:39.640
And the Frenchman said to the Chinese guy,
"What do you think of the French Revolution?"

00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:43.620
The Chinese guy said, "Too soon to tell."
Right?

00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:47.500
Luminaries have long-term thinking.
Think about long-term consequences.

00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:51.440
And they can -- on a good day -- blend their
passion and their principles.

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:57.180
So they will connect with people -- the person
might be missing part of their faculties,

00:10:57.180 --> 00:11:03.190
but if they connect on ideas, they connect.
And so, Luminaries embrace people who have

00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:08.649
the same sort of ideas as them.
At a "hands" level, they can do stuff well

00:11:08.649 --> 00:11:11.420
first time.
Second time, not so good. Third time, bit

00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:16.110
of a disaster. Okay.
The Entrepreneurs -- we know a lot about Entrepreneurs,

00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:22.540
but they're driven by intuition and opportunities.
They are action-oriented. They can pull stuff

00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:26.920
together early on.
And they generate a lot of excitement.

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:31.149
You've probably met people here in Silicon
Valley who will move from one company to the

00:11:31.149 --> 00:11:35.350
next just following an Entrepreneur.
"What's he or she doing? I don't know, but

00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:39.180
I'm going, because I think it's going to be
fun."

00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:43.089
Entrepreneurs are sometimes more heat than
light, but still, people want them, they love

00:11:43.089 --> 00:11:48.370
them, and they can get stuff going.
Managers. Managers are the folks that people

00:11:48.370 --> 00:11:52.690
love to hate.
But the reality is, many of the corporations

00:11:52.690 --> 00:11:55.390
 -- the bigger corporations -- are run by
Managers.

00:11:55.390 --> 00:11:59.220
That's what keeps the board happy.
That's what keeps things stable, if you want

00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:03.779
a "Steady Eddy" kind of environment.
So, Managers -- they're good at long-term

00:12:03.779 --> 00:12:05.279
planning.
They're patient.

00:12:05.279 --> 00:12:10.990
You can give them a mess, and they can fix
it -- doesn't faze them.

00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:13.560
They understand the competencies that are
needed.

00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:19.020
While a Manager is building a team, an Entrepreneur
and Organizer is just doing it themselves.

00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:22.390
But the Manager's thinking, "I don't want
to have to do this a year from now."

00:12:22.390 --> 00:12:26.110
So they'll slowly build a team to get something
done.

00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:30.080
And some people say that, "Managers have no
heart."

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:34.240
That's not true.
They connect with people through consistency.

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:38.709
It might not be the brilliance of the Luminary,
or the excitement of the Entrepreneur, but

00:12:38.709 --> 00:12:41.529
through consistency.
These are the folks who actually do your annual

00:12:41.529 --> 00:12:45.950
reviews on time.
The other guys don't necessarily do it.

00:12:45.950 --> 00:12:49.350
You know, they'll talk about it, they'll think
they've done it if they're a Luminary, they

00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:53.880
imagine they did it. [laughter]
They sold somebody else on doing it, like

00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:57.570
Huckleberry Finn.
But Managers do it themselves.

00:12:57.570 --> 00:13:02.480
So let's chat about Organizers and Networkers.
Organizers are highly intuitive.

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:07.340
And here's the challenge with Organizers.
They're hard to spot because of their high

00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:12.410
level of intuition.
They just do stuff. Give them an objective.

00:13:12.410 --> 00:13:15.209
Don't tell them how to get there. Get out
of the way.

00:13:15.209 --> 00:13:18.020
"An objective plus permission" is what they
like.

00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:23.800
And they don't like the rules, the structure,
or the stricture of the Managers, because

00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:28.130
they can see how to do it without having to
read the manual.

00:13:28.130 --> 00:13:32.220
And so, they're highly instinctive.
And they can also spot what's going to go

00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:34.190
wrong.
So you can put something in front of them,

00:13:34.190 --> 00:13:38.250
and they'll say, "It's not going to work."
And you ask them why, and they'll say, "I

00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:43.730
don't know -- it's not going to work."
Now, actually, in a moment, I'll mention -- let

00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:48.490
me just talk about it now.
When you'll see the Networkers -- the Networkers

00:13:48.490 --> 00:13:53.200
are highly intuitive around people.
They can come into a room, and they can look

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:57.769
out and they can see who's getting it, who
isn't getting it, who's connecting.

00:13:57.769 --> 00:14:01.070
They're great communicators. They're kind
of chameleons.

00:14:01.070 --> 00:14:07.430
In the first edition of the book, there's
a section on "How to Communicate with Different

00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:11.840
Lemons" -- how to adjust what you say, the
pace of what you say, the medium of what you

00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:14.730
say.
With Networkers, there's no advice for them,

00:14:14.730 --> 00:14:19.209
because they do it automatically.
It took some people awhile to figure that

00:14:19.209 --> 00:14:21.459
out.
So in the second edition, I've explained why

00:14:21.459 --> 00:14:25.410
that's the case.
I didn't forget to finish the chapter.

00:14:25.410 --> 00:14:31.490
Networkers just know how to communicate.
And the cool part about the Networkers is,

00:14:31.490 --> 00:14:33.851
they make you feel like you're their best
friend.

00:14:33.851 --> 00:14:39.910
For example, a friend of mine was CFO out
at Sears, and John Chambers from Cisco went

00:14:39.910 --> 00:14:43.200
to see him.
And he says, "Chambers makes you feel like

00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:48.029
you're the only customer," right?
And you know it's not true, but you still

00:14:48.029 --> 00:14:52.270
kind of feel good when he comes around.
Speaking about Chambers for a moment, you'll

00:14:52.270 --> 00:14:57.019
notice what happened with Cisco -- they got
to a stage in their business where they had

00:14:57.019 --> 00:15:01.080
gaps in their product line.
And Chambers was the next perfect CEO, because

00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:04.920
all he did is, he went out and acquired companies
to fill the holes in the product architecture.

00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:10.210
And he could do a billion-dollar deal before
you'd buttered your toast in the morning -- a

00:15:10.210 --> 00:15:17.269
lot of out of instinct and high networker.
So Networkers make you feel like their best

00:15:17.269 --> 00:15:21.040
friend.
Of course, they have 279 best friends.

00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:23.200
They think that they're all actually their
best friends.

00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:26.720
If you go on their Facebook, they're up in
the thousands over there.

00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:32.490
Actually, we ran a LEMON Assessment recently,
and a guy from Microsoft came to me, and it

00:15:32.490 --> 00:15:37.480
showed up that he was something like a Manager
or an Entrepreneur or a Luminary.

00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:42.431
And he came to me, and he said, "I think I'm
a Networker. I think I'm a Networker."

00:15:42.431 --> 00:15:47.010
I said, "Look. The scores are accurate. You're
not a Networker."

00:15:47.010 --> 00:15:50.529
"But, I have more than a thousand friends
on Facebook," he said.

00:15:50.529 --> 00:15:54.990
I said, "Let me go over."
So I took him over to some real Networkers,

00:15:54.990 --> 00:15:58.720
and I said, "Is this guy a Networker?"
They looked at him, and they said, "No, you're

00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:03.240
not a Networker." [laughter]
Networkers know who the Networkers are. Okay.

00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:08.170
What I was going to say was a little bit about
product development.

00:16:08.170 --> 00:16:12.040
In product development, there's often arguments
about who's on point: Is it engineering?

00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:18.730
Is it marketing? Is it sales? Is it development?
Who's carrying the ball at any point in time?

00:16:18.730 --> 00:16:22.290
You can scrap all of that so long as you follow
the LEMON sequence.

00:16:22.290 --> 00:16:25.510
You've got to have Luminaries involved up
front.

00:16:25.510 --> 00:16:29.170
Then, Entrepreneurs to figure out if anybody's
going to buy this thing.

00:16:29.170 --> 00:16:34.700
Then, Managers to actually work on the build.
Then, Organizers to see what's going to go

00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:36.740
wrong.
So you put them in the test function.

00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:40.820
They like to break stuff.
And Networkers to see if anybody will buy

00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:42.459
it.
Doesn't matter which department they come

00:16:42.459 --> 00:16:45.680
from.
I'll give you a practical example.

00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:51.110
A company in South Africa was asked to put
together a curriculum around HIV/AIDS for

00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:55.460
the government in South Africa.
And they were given the project with a fairly

00:16:55.460 --> 00:17:00.470
short timeline.
Now, ordinarily, what they would have done

00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:04.929
is, take a manager, get the project manager,
begin to build out the team.

00:17:04.929 --> 00:17:10.049
And it would have been a long project.
It would have been about a 4-month project

00:17:10.049 --> 00:17:13.459
by their estimate.
What they decided to do, because they'd come

00:17:13.459 --> 00:17:16.059
to understand LEMON Leadership was, switch
things around.

00:17:16.059 --> 00:17:19.199
And immediately, they put a Luminary on the
team.

00:17:19.199 --> 00:17:24.190
And the Luminary scanned through lots of other
curriculum that was out there -- with an Entrepreneur.

00:17:24.190 --> 00:17:27.199
So they had a Luminary and an Entrepreneur
first.

00:17:27.199 --> 00:17:31.690
Then, they got a Networker to see if the rough
ideas would be bought by anybody.

00:17:31.690 --> 00:17:36.399
Then, they added their Manager to bring stability
to the team, and they delivered the project

00:17:36.399 --> 00:17:40.529
in seven-and-a-half weeks.
And the client said they'd never seen anything

00:17:40.529 --> 00:17:44.090
like that before.
So just getting the right mix makes a huge

00:17:44.090 --> 00:17:49.580
difference.
Moving along. This is a quote from a guy who's

00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:51.850
a Manager.
You can see by the length of the quote, it's

00:17:51.850 --> 00:17:56.320
not a very whiz-bingy kind of quote.
He's a nice guy, but he's a Manager.

00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:59.159
You know, when he got married, he had a spreadsheet,
you know?

00:17:59.159 --> 00:18:04.730
The potential fiancŽe -- she had to kind
of get the scores up, and it was a systematic

00:18:04.730 --> 00:18:07.869
approach.
Okay. [laughter] All right.

00:18:07.869 --> 00:18:12.200
Doesn't sound romantic, but she is married.
Okay.

00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:17.840
Let's talk about the weaknesses.
On a bad day, the Luminaries narrowly focus

00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:21.080
on their own ideas.
They get stuck on something -- you've met

00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:23.950
them, right?
The technology changed ten years ago.

00:18:23.950 --> 00:18:28.059
They're still beating the same dead horse,
you know?

00:18:28.059 --> 00:18:34.309
Then, at the "hands" level, they can easily
become disconnected from the organization.

00:18:34.309 --> 00:18:37.840
So, Luminaries think they've given a clear
hand-off.

00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:40.940
"You know? I had this idea in the shower,
and I just thought we should do this -- if

00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:44.210
we strung that together, put that with that,
got it?" Right?

00:18:44.210 --> 00:18:47.999
I mean, it's just -- it's so vague, it's 50,000-foot
level.

00:18:47.999 --> 00:18:50.269
And then, you're supposed to pick it up and
run with it.

00:18:50.269 --> 00:18:55.130
So they often disconnect there.
And if you don't track with their ideas, they'll

00:18:55.130 --> 00:18:59.539
just hit the "eject" button and find somebody
else who does like their ideas -- on a bad

00:18:59.539 --> 00:19:03.549
day.
The Entrepreneurs -- they can chase stuff

00:19:03.549 --> 00:19:06.820
that are nonexistent opportunities -- not
real opportunities.

00:19:06.820 --> 00:19:12.129
And one of the things about Entrepreneurs
is, they don't have failures.

00:19:12.129 --> 00:19:16.269
They just have "learning experiences."
That's what they call them. So they don't

00:19:16.269 --> 00:19:21.070
learn from their mistakes.
And, they can also fake it on the "skills"

00:19:21.070 --> 00:19:24.220
front.
Managers don't like to fake it; they like

00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:29.179
to at least have one skill.
"I can do finance. I can do project management."

00:19:29.179 --> 00:19:33.519
Entrepreneurs and some of the others can do
"anything," and then, they'll go and figure

00:19:33.519 --> 00:19:39.419
out how to do it afterwards. Okay.
Managers -- they can sometimes lack spontaneity.

00:19:39.419 --> 00:19:43.049
The other thing they can do is, they can become
a little bit rigid.

00:19:43.049 --> 00:19:48.330
You see, here's the deal -- Managers write
the manuals, like the HR manual.

00:19:48.330 --> 00:19:53.419
You go along, and you say, "I'd like to take
vacation to go to the Bahamas and then visit

00:19:53.419 --> 00:19:57.649
my cousin over here.
It's like going to look like a 6-weeks [inaudible]."

00:19:57.649 --> 00:20:04.360
"Paragraph 43, Subsection 2, you know, says,
'You can't do that until you've been at Google

00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:07.859
for nine years.'"
And you didn't even know there was such a

00:20:07.859 --> 00:20:11.559
thing.
Now, hint for the other people -- the Managers

00:20:11.559 --> 00:20:15.330
write the rule books, but they don't necessarily
keep them themselves.

00:20:15.330 --> 00:20:19.549
On a bad day, they just know when to bring
them out just to beat on the other people.

00:20:19.549 --> 00:20:25.119
Okay. Organizers -- there's nothing that an
Organizer hates more than a calm pond.

00:20:25.119 --> 00:20:28.690
So they get their excitement out of fighting
fires.

00:20:28.690 --> 00:20:32.629
So if there isn't a fire, start one, right?
[laughter]

00:20:32.629 --> 00:20:38.330
So when you go along and you've got a project
that's going fine, who needs an Organizer?

00:20:38.330 --> 00:20:43.470
So they'll just create an issue, right?
And they'll just raise a problem.

00:20:43.470 --> 00:20:47.020
If you've been out of the office for three
weeks and you want to know what's going on

00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:51.820
and you got one phone call to make, like off
the island -- call the Organizer.

00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:57.030
Because on a bad day, they're like the office
Velcro -- all the dirt sticks to them as they

00:20:57.030 --> 00:20:59.289
go through.
And they can tell you exactly what's going

00:20:59.289 --> 00:21:02.929
on.
And that's the counter-side of their intuition.

00:21:02.929 --> 00:21:09.511
So, a little bit on the Networkers -- they
can have a poor Reality Index.

00:21:09.511 --> 00:21:15.120
And I should mention the Reality Index briefly.
The Managers are at the middle, because they

00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:18.859
have the best grasp of reality.
They're dead in the middle.

00:21:18.859 --> 00:21:28.470
I remember one day, I was at home, and my
son was sitting at a computer looking at a

00:21:28.470 --> 00:21:33.070
picture of his sister.
Off to the other side was my youngest son,

00:21:33.070 --> 00:21:38.769
and my wife Lynn was making an urchin outfit
for him for "Oliver" for the play.

00:21:38.769 --> 00:21:44.909
So he's dressed in rags.
I was exercising, which consisted of pulling

00:21:44.909 --> 00:21:50.440
a rope over a door through a pulley -- a mechanism
designed for astronauts, because there was

00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:53.460
no gravity up there, so they needed something
with resistance.

00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:59.600
And my middle son announces, "This family
is whacked." [laughter]

00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:06.979
And my wife, who's got a lot of Networker
in her -- Networkers like to be liked -- she

00:22:06.979 --> 00:22:08.779
was aghast.
"What do you mean? What do you mean?"

00:22:08.779 --> 00:22:13.979
I said, "Hold on. Hold on. James -- explain
to me, what do you have in mind?"

00:22:13.979 --> 00:22:17.929
He said, "Well, I see every picture of my
sister -- she's smiling, but she's the most

00:22:17.929 --> 00:22:23.850
complex person I know."
Then, there's Davy, who has no defense, because

00:22:23.850 --> 00:22:28.769
he's wearing the rags.
And then, he looks at me -- I'm also, you

00:22:28.769 --> 00:22:33.489
know, in a precarious situation.
I say to him, "James, you think you're the

00:22:33.489 --> 00:22:39.789
only sane one in the family."
"Yep." Now, he's the air force pilot. He's

00:22:39.789 --> 00:22:43.789
the jock.
He's the 97-percent left brain -- Steady Eddy.

00:22:43.789 --> 00:22:49.210
And he thinks the rest of the people are whackos.
And that's the way Managers see things.

00:22:49.210 --> 00:22:54.400
Their view of the world is reality, and out
in left field are the Networkers, er, Luminaries

00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:57.859
and out in right field are the Networkers
 -- and they're somewhat right.

00:22:57.859 --> 00:23:00.919
[referring to projection] So [referring to
screen projection], this is just a quote from

00:23:00.919 --> 00:23:03.419
one of our companies we work with and from
somebody at Cisco.

00:23:03.419 --> 00:23:06.941
I'm going to move right along.
We have a LEMON Assessment.

00:23:06.941 --> 00:23:11.260
It's pretty simple. We take 75 spots.
You don't have to write anything. No handwriting

00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:13.649
analysis.
No references from your doctor.

00:23:13.649 --> 00:23:20.669
All you do is put in the x's and we run the
analytics and what pops up is somebody like

00:23:20.669 --> 00:23:26.100
"Ned Morgan" -- not his real name.
He's a Networker/Manager. Okay?

00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:31.240
And what you understand about this person
is, when you look at their profile, you'll

00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:36.419
get a sense as to how they think, what their
time horizons are, how they hear things when

00:23:36.419 --> 00:23:39.879
you speak to them.
I'll give you an example in a moment.

00:23:39.879 --> 00:23:45.349
You can also stack up the scores for a department.
So, this department is fine, if you're in

00:23:45.349 --> 00:23:49.759
customer service.
If this department is R &amp; D, you've got a

00:23:49.759 --> 00:23:54.529
problem, because they don't have enough from
the Luminary side of things.

00:23:54.529 --> 00:23:58.409
Obviously, you have to weight the data for
teams, and you can see somebody might be high

00:23:58.409 --> 00:24:02.190
on scoring themselves, and somebody might
be low, but you can weight the data for the

00:24:02.190 --> 00:24:05.970
teams.
The other thing that we look at is, What are

00:24:05.970 --> 00:24:10.619
the primary and secondary slices?
So in a room such as this, if you ran the

00:24:10.619 --> 00:24:14.599
assessment, there would be some people who
are primary Luminaries.

00:24:14.599 --> 00:24:18.720
So over here, four primary Luminaries and
three secondary Luminaries.

00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:25.169
We were working with an executive team once,
and out of 40-plus execs, not one primary

00:24:25.169 --> 00:24:29.059
Entrepreneur.
Another company we worked with -- this was

00:24:29.059 --> 00:24:35.450
in Indonesia -- they had a head office staff
of 120 people and this field, direct sales

00:24:35.450 --> 00:24:41.260
staff of 250,000.
And they had one Entrepreneur in the head

00:24:41.260 --> 00:24:46.080
office.
And out in the field, close to 250,000 Entrepreneurs.

00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:48.409
You can imagine what the problems are going
to be.

00:24:48.409 --> 00:24:51.309
They speak a different language. They do different
things.

00:24:51.309 --> 00:24:58.080
So we had to teach the head office folks how
to speak like Entrepreneurs and Networkers.

00:24:58.080 --> 00:25:02.330
You can't change how somebody's wired, but
you can change the way they speak.

00:25:02.330 --> 00:25:06.070
So the next day, it was quite cute.
We had some of the corporate office staff

00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:11.659
and the execs were manning the phones.
And there was the product development lead

00:25:11.659 --> 00:25:17.559
 -- VP of Product Development -- who's a Luminary,
talking like a real schmoozer on the phone

00:25:17.559 --> 00:25:21.609
to somebody out there, because he figured
out how to speak their language and connect

00:25:21.609 --> 00:25:26.570
with them.
So, let me give you a simple example.

00:25:26.570 --> 00:25:34.479
When you ask somebody, "Is the project done?"
And they say to you, "It's finished," what

00:25:34.479 --> 00:25:39.809
do they really mean?
Well, you better know who you're talking to.

00:25:39.809 --> 00:25:48.009
Because, if a Luminary says, "It's finished."
Then what he means is, "I've thought about

00:25:48.009 --> 00:25:51.989
it quite a bit.
You know, I might have written a white paper.

00:25:51.989 --> 00:25:55.960
I e-mailed a few friends.
Conceptually, there's nothing standing in

00:25:55.960 --> 00:26:00.109
the way of this thing getting done.
It's quite conceptually possible. In fact,

00:26:00.109 --> 00:26:06.220
it's as good as done."
When you say to an Entrepreneur, "Is it finished?"

00:26:06.220 --> 00:26:10.970
And they say, "Oh yeah, it's finished," what
they mean is, "It's like one of five things

00:26:10.970 --> 00:26:16.799
that I'm working on at the moment. If it stays
up close to the top of the pile, I'll probably

00:26:16.799 --> 00:26:20.470
push it through, but if a better opportunity
comes along, you're dead -- I'm not going

00:26:20.470 --> 00:26:24.779
to finish it."
Now, when a Manager says, "It's finished,"

00:26:24.779 --> 00:26:28.369
what does a Manager mean?
It's finished -- yeah.

00:26:28.369 --> 00:26:31.580
Otherwise, they'll tell you, "It's 95 percent
complete.

00:26:31.580 --> 00:26:35.799
And over the next two weeks, if you give me
additional resources, I'll finish it."

00:26:35.799 --> 00:26:43.609
That's what the Manager says.
Now, when an Organizer says, "It's finished."

00:26:43.609 --> 00:26:48.321
What they mean is, "It's about 70 percent
done, and that's all I'm going to do.

00:26:48.321 --> 00:26:53.700
I'm not going to do anymore."
Because the other 30 percent, for an Organizer,

00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:57.470
is a complete waste of time.
It's the last like 20 percent of a project

00:26:57.470 --> 00:27:00.639
that takes 80 percent of your resources.
They learn that by instinct.

00:27:00.639 --> 00:27:06.999
So when an Organizer says, "It's done" -- We
moved office once, and the whole move was

00:27:06.999 --> 00:27:11.179
planned by two organizers.
I was in Hawaii. I got back, and it was incredible.

00:27:11.179 --> 00:27:16.070
The whole thing was done in two days.
Except that, when you leaned against the cubes,

00:27:16.070 --> 00:27:20.210
they weren't attached to the wall.
Everything looked like it was in place.

00:27:20.210 --> 00:27:24.779
So I waited a week -- two weeks -- three weeks.
I figured, "At some point, somebody is going

00:27:24.779 --> 00:27:28.200
to bolt the brackets to the wall, connect
everything, finish up all the stuff."

00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:31.269
I was deluded.
I had two organizers working on the thing.

00:27:31.269 --> 00:27:34.840
From their perspective, it was done -- the
phones worked, the printers worked -- that's

00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:38.379
it.
Networkers -- when a Networker says, "It's

00:27:38.379 --> 00:27:44.440
done," what he means is, "I got a friend.
My friend has a cousin, Billy.

00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:50.649
And Billy -- Billy knows a lot of people,
and those -- I have five people that could

00:27:50.649 --> 00:27:56.200
easily -- and if we had a party and brought
those people over, probably" -- It's, you

00:27:56.200 --> 00:27:58.289
know, it's not done.
It's not even close to done.

00:27:58.289 --> 00:28:02.090
So that's the way the Networkers think. [laughter]
So you got to know what you're thinking about.

00:28:02.090 --> 00:28:05.909
So when you're speaking to somebody, you have
to figure out, How do they speak?

00:28:05.909 --> 00:28:10.960
How do they hear things? How do they communicate?
so that you can put the communication in the

00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:17.929
right context. Okay.
We had a situation with one company -- large,

00:28:17.929 --> 00:28:22.409
huge IT organization within a large insurance
company.

00:28:22.409 --> 00:28:26.519
And I saw, during the day-long discussion,
that two people were kind of looking at each

00:28:26.519 --> 00:28:28.690
other.
Clearly, there'd been past issues.

00:28:28.690 --> 00:28:32.039
So I invited them up for a role play. They
agreed.

00:28:32.039 --> 00:28:37.820
And one was a Luminary/Organizer, uh, Luminary/Entrepreneur.
And the other was a Manager/Organizer.

00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:43.219
And the guy -- I said, "Replay what happened."
He said to her, "I got this great idea for

00:28:43.219 --> 00:28:46.359
a new business.
It's a brilliant idea. It's going to be fantastic.

00:28:46.359 --> 00:28:50.119
Don't worry about the details."
He says to her. I said, "Pause right there."

00:28:50.119 --> 00:28:54.599
I said to her, "What did you hear when he
said 'Don't worry about the details'?"

00:28:54.599 --> 00:28:59.259
She said, "I heard 'There aren't any details.'"
Yeah.

00:28:59.259 --> 00:29:02.809
So I said, "What was your response?"
She said, "Well, give me the functional specs

00:29:02.809 --> 00:29:04.710
and the business plan -- the cost-benefit
analysis."

00:29:04.710 --> 00:29:08.669
I said, "Hold on.
Mr. Luminary, what did you hear when she said

00:29:08.669 --> 00:29:11.440
that?"
"Oh, you know, you may as well have told me

00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:16.149
to walk on nails, jump in the fire, pour cold
water on myself. It was like the kiss of death."

00:29:16.149 --> 00:29:20.139
We went back and forth, and I tried to get
them to speak each other's languages, which

00:29:20.139 --> 00:29:23.019
they did.
You know, eventually, they killed the project

00:29:23.019 --> 00:29:25.450
and it was a new business opportunity that
they killed.

00:29:25.450 --> 00:29:30.889
But here was the telling thing -- I asked
the Manager/Organizer, "What probability of

00:29:30.889 --> 00:29:36.679
success did you put on this venture?"
I had asked him the question first, Luminary/Entrepreneur.

00:29:36.679 --> 00:29:44.299
He said, "85 percent." She said, "0 to 1 percent."
That's the gap when we don't understand how

00:29:44.299 --> 00:29:48.950
people are wired and we don't adjust the communications.
Okay.

00:29:48.950 --> 00:29:52.289
So I'm not going to speak about all the communications
overview.

00:29:52.289 --> 00:29:56.230
Just to say -- before I take some questions
 -- that there's multiple branches to the

00:29:56.230 --> 00:30:00.489
LEMON Tree.
There's the LEMON Basics -- your characteristics,

00:30:00.489 --> 00:30:03.229
strengths, weaknesses, how you're wired, what
you do for work.

00:30:03.229 --> 00:30:06.149
There's also LEMON Communications -- I hinted
at that.

00:30:06.149 --> 00:30:10.799
Product Development is another one.
If you're in HR, how do you make sure you

00:30:10.799 --> 00:30:13.309
hire the right people?
Here's the thesis.

00:30:13.309 --> 00:30:18.659
On any major project or on a leadership team,
you need all five slices of the lemon.

00:30:18.659 --> 00:30:24.219
The problem is, we hire people who are like
us, for the most part.

00:30:24.219 --> 00:30:27.799
We had a company in Texas, brought in a new
VP of Compliance.

00:30:27.799 --> 00:30:31.119
You can guess, she's a Manager. And what did
she want to do?

00:30:31.119 --> 00:30:35.080
Fire all of the non-Managers, because they
weren't like her.

00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:39.929
Who did she need to turn the place around?
Not the Managers. She needed the Entrepreneurs

00:30:39.929 --> 00:30:43.289
and the Organizers.
And so, hiring is important.

00:30:43.289 --> 00:30:47.739
Team Building -- some other facets to the
LEMON Tree.

00:30:47.739 --> 00:30:53.769
Now, just to sum up from a different angle
 -- the LEMONs care about different things.

00:30:53.769 --> 00:31:00.549
So what do Luminaries care about?
They care about ideas -- "Why?" "Why?"

00:31:00.549 --> 00:31:05.130
The Entrepreneurs don't give a hoot about
"why," because ideas are a dime a dozen.

00:31:05.130 --> 00:31:07.690
You can get those -- just go up the road to
Stanford or whatever.

00:31:07.690 --> 00:31:12.580
You can get tons of ideas.
The question is, can you turn it into an opportunity?

00:31:12.580 --> 00:31:16.909
And so, they care about "What?" And then,
"When?"

00:31:16.909 --> 00:31:21.429
The Managers care about "How?"
Any fool can come up with an idea, but can

00:31:21.429 --> 00:31:26.559
you actually implement?
Things haven't begun until there's a plan.

00:31:26.559 --> 00:31:29.379
Now, Organizers -- they care about costs and
crises.

00:31:29.379 --> 00:31:34.309
They care about "When/What."
So the best solution for an Organizer is the

00:31:34.309 --> 00:31:38.139
quick solution.
And they like -- when you're talking to an

00:31:38.139 --> 00:31:40.210
Organizer, they always want to bring things
to a close.

00:31:40.210 --> 00:31:45.909
They hate loose ends.
I know some Organizers who can't go to bed

00:31:45.909 --> 00:31:51.049
at night unless their unread e-mail is less
than one screen.

00:31:51.049 --> 00:31:54.599
Whereas, that doesn't bother the Luminaries.
They have hundreds of them, right?

00:31:54.599 --> 00:31:59.670
Networkers -- they care about "Who."
Look, they don't like people more than other

00:31:59.670 --> 00:32:03.049
people.
But, they understand the people dynamics.

00:32:03.049 --> 00:32:08.709
They understand that kind of relational capital.
So, in summary -- from your friends at Wertle

00:32:08.709 --> 00:32:15.849
 -- that's the summary of the whole book.
And -- oh, yeah -- here's a little quiz for

00:32:15.849 --> 00:32:18.339
you.
You've got it if you understand how to ruin

00:32:18.339 --> 00:32:19.940
the day of a LEMON.
It's pretty easy.

00:32:19.940 --> 00:32:22.909
How would you ruin the day of a Luminary?
Any suggestions?

00:32:22.909 --> 00:32:23.909
Audience: Details.

00:32:23.909 --> 00:32:28.379
Brett Johnson: Oh yeah, give them a lot of
details -- that'll be good.

00:32:28.379 --> 00:32:31.479
Audience: Invite them to a [inaudible] planning
session.

00:32:31.479 --> 00:32:34.590
Yeah, okay -- so long as they don't have to
do too much, they wouldn't mind being there

00:32:34.590 --> 00:32:37.120
for awhile. Okay.
How else would you ruin the day of a Luminary?

00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:39.399
Audience: Kill their ideas.

00:32:39.399 --> 00:32:40.710
Brett Johnson: Kill their ideas. There's a
better way.

00:32:40.710 --> 00:32:47.549
What else would you do? Steal their ideas,
right? [laughter] That's great.

00:32:47.549 --> 00:32:51.679
You can kill it, but if you can just take
it, put your name on the white paper.

00:32:51.679 --> 00:32:54.830
Right?
They've slaved there three years thinking

00:32:54.830 --> 00:32:59.210
in all their Google spare time, come up with
stuff, and you just say, "I've got a few friends

00:32:59.210 --> 00:33:02.139
over here -- can we kind of add our names
on there?"

00:33:02.139 --> 00:33:05.700
We had a guy who lived with us -- an intern
 -- and then, we had a second intern.

00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:09.409
And the intern would compose these flowing
reports and send them back overseas.

00:33:09.409 --> 00:33:15.129
And Number 2 would just take them, change
a few names, and send them off again, right?

00:33:15.129 --> 00:33:18.159
So, you can ruin a Luminary's day by stealing
their ideas. Right.

00:33:18.159 --> 00:33:24.039
How about an Entrepreneur? How can you ruin
their day? Okay?

00:33:24.039 --> 00:33:27.790
Audience: Steal their opportunities

00:33:27.790 --> 00:33:28.790
Brett Johnson: Steal their opportunities.
Kind of great.

00:33:28.790 --> 00:33:33.350
You put a sales guy onto an account.
"Okay, you're responsible for this." And they

00:33:33.350 --> 00:33:36.239
work six months.
They get to know everybody -- their birthdays,

00:33:36.239 --> 00:33:40.229
their dog's names -- everything.
Get the client in, and you reassign them,

00:33:40.229 --> 00:33:42.659
right?
That's a great way to ruin.

00:33:42.659 --> 00:33:45.440
Managers -- you can mess with their systems,
right? [laughter]

00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:49.679
Just for the heck of it.
Now, Managers actually believe that other

00:33:49.679 --> 00:33:55.830
people understand systems and just don't obey
them just to get up the manager's nose.

00:33:55.830 --> 00:34:00.149
That's what Managers really think.
But, for the Managers -- I got to tell you

00:34:00.149 --> 00:34:04.740
 -- the Networkers don't even see the expense
reporting system unless they're really desperate

00:34:04.740 --> 00:34:10.179
for money, you know?
And so, Organizers -- take away their leader.

00:34:10.179 --> 00:34:14.010
You've heard, "Take me to your leader."
Organizers are most satisfied when they're

00:34:14.010 --> 00:34:19.179
supporting a leader, often in the background.
But when you put a Manager between the Organizer

00:34:19.179 --> 00:34:23.130
and the Leader, you'll ruin their day.
That's what happens in Washington, D.C.

00:34:23.130 --> 00:34:27.270
These people you've never heard of -- they
get a Manager between themselves and the President,

00:34:27.270 --> 00:34:30.270
and they write the "Kiss and Tell" books,
you know?

00:34:30.270 --> 00:34:34.810
About this president or that president.
Networkers -- how can you ruin a Networker's

00:34:34.810 --> 00:34:35.810
day?

00:34:35.810 --> 00:34:37.100
Audience: Isolate them.

00:34:37.100 --> 00:34:40.710
Brett Johnson: Isolate them.
That's a cool thing. Yeah.

00:34:40.710 --> 00:34:46.970
They love to be with people, right?
Networkers have an uncanny ability to connect

00:34:46.970 --> 00:34:49.570
the dots.
You're a normal person, and you think -- they'll

00:34:49.570 --> 00:34:53.630
come to you, and they'll say, "Oh, Jean -- you
got to meet this friend of mine in London

00:34:53.630 --> 00:34:57.790
and the other guy in Houston.
If the three of you get together, I know."

00:34:57.790 --> 00:35:00.500
See?
Networkers have this belief, "If we get enough

00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:04.460
smart people together in the room, then the
miracles are going to happen, you know?"

00:35:04.460 --> 00:35:08.220
No agenda, nothing, very exciting for the
Networkers.

00:35:08.220 --> 00:35:14.700
And the fact is, they're intuitive about that.
I hired my first intern. He was a Networker.

00:35:14.700 --> 00:35:18.450
He came to me, and he said, "Oh, I've got
this friend. I met him playing soccer" and

00:35:18.450 --> 00:35:21.540
this, that.
But this was his second opportunity.

00:35:21.540 --> 00:35:26.460
His first opportunity was so flaky -- some
guy in Florida doing some harebrained thing.

00:35:26.460 --> 00:35:30.740
So the second time he came, [phht] I didn't
even listen to him.

00:35:30.740 --> 00:35:35.950
Eighteen months later, Michael Yang sold my
assignment for 685 million, you know?

00:35:35.950 --> 00:35:38.790
We could have had a piece of that if I listened
to my Networker.

00:35:38.790 --> 00:35:47.290
So, okay. So, that's it.
And I wanted to let you know that we do have

00:35:47.290 --> 00:35:50.161
some books here.
And we're running low on the first edition.

00:35:50.161 --> 00:35:55.021
But just for you guys -- within about 24 hours
 -- as soon as Amazon gets their stuff together,

00:35:55.021 --> 00:35:58.940
there'll be a second edition up on Kindle.
Just to let you know -- black and white and

00:35:58.940 --> 00:36:02.130
boring, but there you go.
So, that's the story.

00:36:02.130 --> 00:36:05.170
Thank you very much.
And I'll be happy to take questions at this

00:36:05.170 --> 00:36:06.170
point.

00:36:06.170 --> 00:36:07.170
[applause]

00:36:07.170 --> 00:36:08.230
Brett Johnson: Go ahead.

00:36:08.230 --> 00:36:16.410
Q: I'm wondering, you mentioned some of the
other Myers-Briggs and colors and some other

00:36:16.410 --> 00:36:23.500
things, how do these five styles attract to
those? Are there similarities or ...?

00:36:23.500 --> 00:36:27.880
Brett Johnson: Yeah. I see them as a complement.
Okay, so to repeat, the question is -- what

00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:32.970
about DISC, Myers-Briggs, colors, dogs, otters,
lions, bears, all that kind of stuff.

00:36:32.970 --> 00:36:39.520
How do they fit in?
And the reality is that I tell people that

00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:42.810
"This is a complement to those things."
This isn't about styles.

00:36:42.810 --> 00:36:49.970
So you can be an indirect Manager.
You can be an abstract or a concrete Luminary.

00:36:49.970 --> 00:36:55.320
You can be an introverted Networker.
And one of the things I'd have to catch myself

00:36:55.320 --> 00:37:00.310
doing is not judging a book by its color.
Not saying, "Oh, she's introverted, so she

00:37:00.310 --> 00:37:05.020
can't be a Networker."
I really have to run the tests to see.

00:37:05.020 --> 00:37:08.430
Or "He looks like my friend who's a Manager,
so he's a Manager."

00:37:08.430 --> 00:37:12.790
No. And so, at the back of the book over here,
as you go through the book, you can build

00:37:12.790 --> 00:37:17.400
up your own compass and profile.
And so, I've got a way to build up a profile.

00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:20.340
And at the bottom are some of the complementary
things.

00:37:20.340 --> 00:37:23.540
So I see it as a complement, not an "instead
of."

00:37:23.540 --> 00:37:27.520
It's pretty simple to understand.
There's a VP friend of mine who's Head of

00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:29.980
Product Development at a company down the
road over here.

00:37:29.980 --> 00:37:34.270
And he sat down with his 5-year-old and 7-year-old
and they talked through LEMON Leadership.

00:37:34.270 --> 00:37:38.360
And what they talked about is, "Is it fair
for the parents to discipline the two kids

00:37:38.360 --> 00:37:41.870
the same, because one's a Luminary and one's
a Manager?" You know?

00:37:41.870 --> 00:37:46.640
And stuff like that. So a kid can get it quite
easily at a basic level.

00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:52.980
And at a more complex level, you know, there's
other layers too.

00:37:52.980 --> 00:38:04.660
Other questions? [long pause] Going once...
Alanna.

00:38:04.660 --> 00:38:08.700
Q: Give us another communication style.

00:38:08.700 --> 00:38:17.750
Brett Johnson: Yeah, sure. The issue of "communications"
is that -- you'll be able to spot somebody

00:38:17.750 --> 00:38:22.750
somewhat by the way they communicate.
Now, a friend of mine actually has come up

00:38:22.750 --> 00:38:26.460
with a concept of "LEMON Bait."
So if you're in a room like this -- you're

00:38:26.460 --> 00:38:29.010
dealing with a group of people.
You don't know what they are.

00:38:29.010 --> 00:38:31.130
So he throws out a little bit of Luminary
bait.

00:38:31.130 --> 00:38:35.310
"This research thing that somebody's been
working on in Google, and the screensavers

00:38:35.310 --> 00:38:37.960
go on."
Nobody bites, you know?

00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:41.570
Then, he throws out something about an opportunity.
"If we did this project together, we could

00:38:41.570 --> 00:38:44.420
do a joint market and collaborate."
Nothing, right?

00:38:44.420 --> 00:38:48.730
Then, you throw out and you say, "Our policies
and procedures, this is our budget, our timelines..."

00:38:48.730 --> 00:38:52.320
and all the lights go on -- you're talking
to Managers, right?

00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:59.330
And so, then the communication piece is -- you
can see over here the content, the format,

00:38:59.330 --> 00:39:06.660
in other words the media that they use, the
way in which they express things.

00:39:06.660 --> 00:39:10.290
Whether they talk about issues, opportunities
 -- when I'm talking to somebody, I'm looking

00:39:10.290 --> 00:39:12.590
out generally to see when their eyes light
up.

00:39:12.590 --> 00:39:15.870
When I talk about ideas, do they light up?
When I talk about issues, do they light up?

00:39:15.870 --> 00:39:21.330
When I talk about people?
For example, the language of Networkers is

00:39:21.330 --> 00:39:24.320
stories.
So if you're talking to Networkers, you've

00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:27.670
got to talk stories.
You know, they cry during the dog commercials.

00:39:27.670 --> 00:39:34.840
They love a story. They love an underdog,
an overdog. Any kind of stuff.

00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:37.850
They love -- so long as there's a story over
there, right?

00:39:37.850 --> 00:39:43.140
Managers like facts.
So if you're a salesperson who's a Networker

00:39:43.140 --> 00:39:48.080
and you're trying to convince a Manager, and
you tell more and more and more stories, their

00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:52.240
credibility index just starts going down,
because the Manager is thinking, "This person

00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:57.580
doesn't have the facts, right?"
If you're a Luminary, and you go in and somebody

00:39:57.580 --> 00:40:02.000
doesn't buy what you're saying, you know?
You just make the vision bigger.

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:07.700
You make the searches intergalactic. You know?
You make the response times submilliseconds.

00:40:07.700 --> 00:40:14.020
And so, you throw more vision at it, rather
than giving the person exactly what they need.

00:40:14.020 --> 00:40:17.140
They just want to know, "What's the start
date, end date, resources," or whatever.

00:40:17.140 --> 00:40:24.030
And so, on the communication front, you can
see by the way that people communicate -- if

00:40:24.030 --> 00:40:29.000
you have a short amount of time with somebody,
you can pick up verbal cues which will tell

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:32.980
you how they're wired.
And that can be a super-useful thing.

00:40:32.980 --> 00:40:36.820
And then, what you have to do is, rotate the
lemon.

00:40:36.820 --> 00:40:42.340
As a leader, you have to figure out, "What
does this situation call for?" because you

00:40:42.340 --> 00:40:47.800
might be a Manager/Networker, and the situation
calls for a Luminary/Entrepreneur.

00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:52.130
Rotate the lemon.
It'll hurt a little bit, but you can do it.

00:40:52.130 --> 00:40:57.160
This is a huge difference between LEMON Leadership
and other stuff where we say "Avoid your weaknesses."

00:40:57.160 --> 00:41:03.330
I'm saying, "No, each of us can make an adjustment."
The only thing that's going to stop me behaving

00:41:03.330 --> 00:41:08.330
more like one of the other slices is actually
me thinking my slice is better than their

00:41:08.330 --> 00:41:12.490
slice.
"All LEMONS are equal, but some LEMONS are

00:41:12.490 --> 00:41:17.140
more equal than others" -- That kind of mindset
will stop your rotating, you know?

00:41:17.140 --> 00:41:22.010
And I'm saying, on any team, "Even if you're
missing -- you look at your team -- there's

00:41:22.010 --> 00:41:24.580
six of you in a row, and you're missing an
Entrepreneur."

00:41:24.580 --> 00:41:28.320
You can all put on your Entrepreneur hat,
and say, "How would an Entrepreneur look at

00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:33.010
this? How would an Entrepreneur communicate
this? Etcetera."

00:41:33.010 --> 00:41:35.980
Okay. One more, yeah.

00:41:35.980 --> 00:41:43.060
Q: [inaudible]

00:41:43.060 --> 00:41:57.800
Brett Johnson: Yeah. Okay -- so, are there
combinations that pose more challenges than

00:41:57.800 --> 00:42:03.200
others? Yeah.
Well, at a broad level, if you're developing

00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:11.310
people, or if you are one, one of the hardest
challenges is the growth part for an Organizer,

00:42:11.310 --> 00:42:16.631
because they're so intuitive.
They function so highly out of intuition.

00:42:16.631 --> 00:42:23.800
So how to get them to grow beyond their intuition
is a challenge.

00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:28.960
It's also hard to follow Organizers when they're
at the head of a corporation.

00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:34.880
Jack Welsh, for example, when he took over
at GE, I think he was an Organizer/Entrepreneur.

00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:38.690
And his vision was pretty simple -- "Number
1 or Number 2 in any market -- otherwise,

00:42:38.690 --> 00:42:42.470
you're out. End of story."
But at least he communicated that clearly.

00:42:42.470 --> 00:42:46.250
If you're functioning highly off intuition,
a bit of a challenge there.

00:42:46.250 --> 00:42:49.220
Other combinations, no.
There's no right or wrong answers.

00:42:49.220 --> 00:42:51.950
You just have to understand your primary and
secondary slice.

00:42:51.950 --> 00:42:56.480
And make sure you know when you're having
a bad day.

00:42:56.480 --> 00:43:01.200
Because when you're having a bad day, you
can see -- you begin to function out of the

00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:05.070
negatives -- the weaknesses of your secondary
slice -- and you just have to make adjustments.

00:43:05.070 --> 00:43:09.910
That's super helpful to me.
On a good day, I'm a bright Luminary -- good

00:43:09.910 --> 00:43:14.690
ideas, and so on.
On a bad day, I'm the Manager from hell, right?

00:43:14.690 --> 00:43:18.520
And, you know, and I know what they should
be doing and I nitpick.

00:43:18.520 --> 00:43:22.790
I don't build people up. I don't foster them.
I just kind of get nitpicky on the details.

00:43:22.790 --> 00:43:26.819
But if I know I'm having a bad day, I can
go off and get a latte -- do something different

00:43:26.819 --> 00:43:31.190
 -- go take a walk or something, you know?
Yeah. I had a husband-wife combination.

00:43:31.190 --> 00:43:35.780
He's an expert -- both of them -- in Myers-Briggs,
DISC, and all of that stuff in another country.

00:43:35.780 --> 00:43:40.030
So I can talk about them.
And, they run a leadership development institute.

00:43:40.030 --> 00:43:45.720
That's what they do.
He's a Luminary/Organizer. She's a Manager/Organizer.

00:43:45.720 --> 00:43:50.120
The problem was, they were about to become
a statistic of couples that couldn't work

00:43:50.120 --> 00:43:55.060
together. Why?
She thought she was doing all the work and

00:43:55.060 --> 00:43:59.000
he was just having ideas.
And then, they would have a bad day and they

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:03.430
would both be in the negatives of Organizers.
Now, what they do is, they'll go play golf

00:44:03.430 --> 00:44:07.110
if they're both having a bad day.
They'll stop the work. It's a waste of time.

00:44:07.110 --> 00:44:11.620
And they figured out how to complement each
other and get the job done.

00:44:11.620 --> 00:44:16.840
Good. Alanna, I think we're done on time.
Thank you very much.

00:44:16.840 --> 00:44:17.910
[applause]
