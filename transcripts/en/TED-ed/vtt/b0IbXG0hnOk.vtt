00:00:06.842 --> 00:00:11.668
Many of the inanimate objects around you
probably seem perfectly still.

00:00:11.668 --> 00:00:15.663
But look deep into the atomic structure
of any of them,

00:00:15.663 --> 00:00:18.333
and you'll see a world in constant flux.

00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:19.138
Stretching,

00:00:19.138 --> 00:00:20.067
contracting,

00:00:20.067 --> 00:00:21.002
springing,

00:00:21.002 --> 00:00:21.977
jittering,

00:00:21.977 --> 00:00:25.158
drifting atoms everywhere.

00:00:25.158 --> 00:00:28.355
And though that movement may seem chaotic,
it's not random.

00:00:28.355 --> 00:00:29.890
Atoms that are bonded together,

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:32.269
and that describes almost all substances,

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:34.881
move according to a set of principles.

00:00:34.881 --> 00:00:39.776
For example, take molecules,
atoms held together by covalent bonds.

00:00:39.776 --> 00:00:42.322
There are three basic ways 
molecules can move:

00:00:42.322 --> 00:00:43.214
rotation,

00:00:43.214 --> 00:00:44.337
translation,

00:00:44.337 --> 00:00:45.886
and vibration.

00:00:45.886 --> 00:00:49.038
Rotation and translation 
move a molecule in space

00:00:49.038 --> 00:00:52.166
while its atoms stay 
the same distance apart.

00:00:52.166 --> 00:00:55.608
Vibration, on the other hand, 
changes those distances,

00:00:55.608 --> 00:00:58.250
actually altering the molecule's shape.

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.688
For any molecule, you can count up
the number of different ways it can move.

00:01:02.688 --> 00:01:05.304
That corresponds to 
its degrees of freedom,

00:01:05.304 --> 00:01:06.941
which in the context of mechanics

00:01:06.941 --> 00:01:10.450
basically means the number of variables
we need to take into account

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.345
to understand the full system.

00:01:13.345 --> 00:01:18.019
Three-dimensional space is defined by
x, y, and z axes.

00:01:18.019 --> 00:01:23.034
Translation allows the molecule to move
in the direction of any of them.

00:01:23.034 --> 00:01:25.098
That's three degrees of freedom.

00:01:25.098 --> 00:01:28.758
It can also rotate around 
any of these three axes.

00:01:28.758 --> 00:01:29.990
That's three more,

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.042
unless it's a linear molecule, 
like carbon dioxide.

00:01:33.042 --> 00:01:37.457
There, one of the rotations just spins
the molecule around its own axis,

00:01:37.457 --> 00:01:41.607
which doesn't count because it doesn't
change the position of the atoms.

00:01:41.607 --> 00:01:44.596
Vibration is where it gets a bit tricky.

00:01:44.596 --> 00:01:46.979
Let's take a simple molecule,
like hydrogen.

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.682
The length of the bond that holds the two
atoms together is constantly changing

00:01:51.682 --> 00:01:54.479
as if the atoms were connected 
by a spring.

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.985
That change in distance is tiny,
less than a billionth of a meter.

00:01:58.985 --> 00:02:03.791
The more atoms and bonds a molecule has,
the more vibrational modes.

00:02:03.791 --> 00:02:06.816
For example, a water molecule 
has three atoms:

00:02:06.816 --> 00:02:10.164
one oxygen and two hydrogens,
and two bonds.

00:02:10.164 --> 00:02:12.476
That gives it three modes of vibration:

00:02:12.476 --> 00:02:13.824
symmetric stretching,

00:02:13.824 --> 00:02:15.408
asymmetric stretching,

00:02:15.408 --> 00:02:16.896
and bending.

00:02:16.896 --> 00:02:21.142
More complicated molecules have even
fancier vibrational modes,

00:02:21.142 --> 00:02:22.426
like rocking,

00:02:22.426 --> 00:02:23.607
wagging,

00:02:23.607 --> 00:02:25.195
and twisting.

00:02:25.195 --> 00:02:29.854
If you know how many atoms a molecule has,
you can count its vibrational modes.

00:02:29.854 --> 00:02:32.011
Start with the total degrees of freedom,

00:02:32.011 --> 00:02:35.427
which is three times the number
of atoms in the molecule.

00:02:35.427 --> 00:02:38.837
That's because each atom can move
in three different directions.

00:02:38.837 --> 00:02:41.393
Three of the total correspond 
to translation

00:02:41.393 --> 00:02:44.633
when all the atoms 
are going in the same direction.

00:02:44.633 --> 00:02:49.430
And three, or two for linear molecules,
correspond to rotations.

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.999
All the rest, 3N-6
or 3N-5 for linear molecules,

00:02:53.999 --> 00:02:56.127
are vibrations.

00:02:56.127 --> 00:02:57.961
So what's causing all this motion?

00:02:57.961 --> 00:03:02.053
Molecules move because they absorb
energy from their surroundings,

00:03:02.053 --> 00:03:05.748
mainly in the form of heat
or electromagnetic radiation.

00:03:05.748 --> 00:03:08.355
When this energy gets transferred
to the molecules,

00:03:08.355 --> 00:03:09.415
they vibrate,

00:03:09.415 --> 00:03:10.221
rotate,

00:03:10.221 --> 00:03:12.507
or translate faster.

00:03:12.507 --> 00:03:16.534
Faster motion increases the kinetic energy
of the molecules and atoms.

00:03:16.534 --> 00:03:20.792
We define this as an increase 
in temperature and thermal energy.

00:03:20.792 --> 00:03:25.445
This is the phenomenon your microwave oven
uses to heat your food.

00:03:25.445 --> 00:03:29.247
The oven emits microwave radiation,
which is absorbed by the molecules,

00:03:29.247 --> 00:03:31.723
especially those of water.

00:03:31.723 --> 00:03:33.659
They move around faster and faster,

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:38.101
bumping into each other and increasing
the food's temperature and thermal energy.

00:03:38.101 --> 00:03:40.513
The greenhouse effect is another example.

00:03:40.513 --> 00:03:43.250
Some of the solar radiation 
that hits the Earth's surface

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.605
is reflected back to the atmosphere.

00:03:45.605 --> 00:03:51.006
Greenhouse gases, like water vapor
and carbon dioxide absorb this radiation

00:03:51.006 --> 00:03:52.491
and speed up.

00:03:52.491 --> 00:03:57.573
These hotter, faster-moving molecules
emit infrared radiation in all directions,

00:03:57.573 --> 00:04:00.346
including back to Earth, warming it.

00:04:00.346 --> 00:04:03.338
Does all this molecular motion ever stop?

00:04:03.338 --> 00:04:05.940
You might think that would happen
at absolute zero,

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:07.815
the coldest possible temperature.

00:04:07.815 --> 00:04:10.677
No one's ever managed to cool
anything down that much,

00:04:10.677 --> 00:04:11.998
but even if we could,

00:04:11.998 --> 00:04:16.213
molecules would still move due to
a quantum mechanical principle

00:04:16.213 --> 00:04:18.561
called zero-point energy.

00:04:18.561 --> 00:04:22.747
In other words, everything has been moving
since the universe's very first moments,

00:04:22.747 --> 00:04:26.220
and will keep going long, 
long after we're gone.
