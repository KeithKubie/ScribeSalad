00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.600
After Fast Five turned the street racing franchise into a globe-trotting action blockbuster,

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:16.260
and Fast Six and Seven coasted off its momentum,

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:19.600
the newest combination of F words and numbers is here,

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.020
and they're still huffing off the fifth one's fumes.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.920
Wow, these are getting really forced.

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:32.180
Buckle up for all the things you come to expect from the fast-chise:

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:33.200
Cars,

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.540
not cars,

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:36.400
"She just carjacked a submarine."

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:37.480
family,

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.720
and Vin Diesel mumble-growls.

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.000
"You made me happy."

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.660
"I choose to make my own fate."

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:43.960
"It's why I'm here."

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.920
And a sequel that really overestimates how much you remember from the last three.

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.620
"Ah yes, your brother Owen. Who could forget him, huh?"

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:52.340
I did.

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:53.320
"Elena."

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:55.360
Uhhh, who's that now?

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.800
"He's also linked to somebody I'd quite like to forget."

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.300
Wait, Djimon Hounsou was in these?

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.740
Look, I'm here for cars and butts in no particular order.

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:03.440
Don't overthink this, guys.

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.460
When somebody steals a something,

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.740
the government won't do anything about it because this guy said so.

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.020
"US government cannot sanction this operation in any way."

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.800
Now they're sending in a gang of petty thieves and street racers to get it back,

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.560
who became elite special forces so gradually,

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.300
you never stop to think about it.

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.940
You're carjackers! When did you turn into John Wick?

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.140
Join Tyrese, Ludacris, Kurt Russell,

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.140
and other characters who you refer to by their actors' names,

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.960
as they fade into the background of a buddy action comedy

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.200
starring Jason Statham and The Rock,

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.940
two meta-humans on opposite sides of the law,

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.960
responsible for every cool scene in the movie

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.340
and struggling not to give in to their raw animal lust for each other.

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.140
"All show, no go!"

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.000
"Oh, I got plenty of go!"

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:02.800
I am SO in for this spinoff.

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:06.760
When you're done having fun,

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:12.060
spend lots of time sitting on an airplane with the only guy who still takes these films seriously,

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.300
Vin Diesel.

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.660
As the movie whips from live-action cartoon where THIS happens

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.120
to serious drama where this happens.

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:22.840
"I'm gonna kill your son."

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.380
He's literally turned his back on his family,

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:29.140
and walked in to a different, much more boring movie with Charlize Theron.

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.560
She's Cipher, a hacker should really fire her assistant.

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.980
"My assistant actually came up with the hair."

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:36.980
"She just kinda out of nowhere said,

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:38.420
you should do, dreadlocks."

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.660
When she's not talking to her computer screen,

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:41.440
"What are you gonna do?"

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.940
"I spy with my little eye..."

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.140
"Minister of Defense."

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.580
she's whispering!

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.100
"Is that really a choice you wanna make?"

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.820
"I want you to learn."

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:53.840
"This is the consequence of that."

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:57.340
"Painful, but instructional memory."

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.800
"Ssssssssssshhhhhhhhhhhhh!"

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.800
Hey, Charlize, you're better than this.

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.080
Ratchet up the egos as The Rock and Vin Diesel

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.920
almost share screen time, as they sort of cross paths in voiceover,

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:10.760
"Hey, Dom."

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:11.720
"Hey, Hobbs."

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.520
in the distant background,

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:18.840
or in edits that make it seem like Vin wasn't the candy-ass male co-star The Rock called out on Instagram.

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:20.580
Come on guys, squash the beef!

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:22.100
You have so much in common, like,

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.520
uhhh, but you both, the, uhh,

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.260
hate sleeves!

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.860
Oh well, we'll always have Brazil.

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:30.780
"This is BRAZIL!"

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.400
So enjoy the latest installment of the franchise that's still chugging along,

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.200
no matter how much the co-stars hate each other,

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.140
how much the women are sidelined,

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.080
or how clearly they're trying to fill Paul Walker's shoes

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:44.440
with this dingus.

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.980
Just turn your brain off, and watch the cars go boom,

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.360
because they're counting on you to never ask for anything more.

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.060
You guys want to see Tyrese fight a spaceship in the next one or not?

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.560
"Rule number one: know your audience."

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:34.829
"Vin, for many years you've been the biggest supporter of strong women,

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:39.720
and I've always appreciated that about you throughout the year."

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:41.240
Michelle, are you okay?

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.760
Are you being held against your will? Blow a kiss if you want us to call the police.

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:46.980
Okay, I'm calling the cops.

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:51.640
Hey. Screen Junkies, ever wondered what Planet of the Apes' Caesar would be like in today's world?

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:53.420
What's his Tinder file like?

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:59.300
Teen to early 20s. I like long swings in the woods.

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:02.240
See more of our honest shenanigans

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:07.220
