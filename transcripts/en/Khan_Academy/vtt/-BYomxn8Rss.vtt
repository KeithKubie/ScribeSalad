00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.777
We're told that "Each square below
represents one whole."

00:00:03.777 --> 00:00:07.352
So this big square right over here
is a whole,

00:00:07.352 --> 00:00:10.669
and then this big square over here
is another whole.

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:15.103
Then they ask us "Which of the following
does the shaded area represent?

00:00:15.103 --> 00:00:19.102
Select all that apply." So let's see--
the shaded area. We're shaded in blue.

00:00:19.102 --> 00:00:23.104
So let's see-- one way to think about it
is we have 1 whole over here.

00:00:23.104 --> 00:00:29.433
and then over here we've divided it
into tenths: there's 1, 2, 3, 4,

00:00:29.433 --> 00:00:35.197
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 equal sections,
and we've shaded in one of them.

00:00:35.197 --> 00:00:40.936
So we've shaded 1 tenth.
So this would be 1 whole and 1 tenth.

00:00:40.936 --> 00:00:44.622
So we could say that this
is 1 and 1 tenth.

00:00:44.622 --> 00:00:48.201
So that's one way to think about it,
but what about these other ones?

00:00:48.201 --> 00:00:51.665
Well even this one has been
divided into tenths,

00:00:51.665 --> 00:00:55.034
and you can view 1 whole
as 10 tenths. You see that here,

00:00:55.034 --> 00:00:58.477
where we've divided it
into 10 equal sections. 10 tenths,

00:00:58.477 --> 00:01:02.296
and we've shaded all 10 tenths in.
So this whole you could view

00:01:02.296 --> 00:01:08.621
as 10 tenths:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

00:01:08.621 --> 00:01:10.947
And then we have an 11th tenth.

00:01:13.197 --> 00:01:18.301
So we have-- if you count these
blue rectangles, we have 11 tenths.

00:01:18.301 --> 00:01:21.564
So you could also write this as 11 tenths.

00:01:21.564 --> 00:01:24.970
Now 11 hundredths? No, I don't think--
we haven't even

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.703
divided this into hundredths,
and 11 hundredths would be

00:01:28.703 --> 00:01:33.802
a little more than 1 tenth. And so
this is definitely way more than that.

00:01:33.802 --> 00:01:37.508
So I could check my answer (and
actually you don't see it but it's

00:01:37.508 --> 00:01:41.608
happening off-screen) but this is
what I would go with for that.

00:01:41.608 --> 00:01:44.758
Let's do a couple more of these.

00:01:44.758 --> 00:01:48.088
So it says "Which of the following
describes the location of the point

00:01:48.088 --> 00:01:50.268
on the number line?" Let's see.

00:01:50.268 --> 00:01:55.524
I have 1, and then between 1 and 2
I've divided it into 10 equal spaces.

00:01:55.524 --> 00:02:00.227
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

00:02:00.227 --> 00:02:04.464
So each of these tick marks,
or hash marks, is going to be a tenth.

00:02:04.464 --> 00:02:08.667
So this is 1 and 0 tenths,
1 and 1 tenth, 1 and 2 tenths,

00:02:08.667 --> 00:02:12.068
1 and 3 tenths, 1 and 4 tenths,
1 and 5 tenths,

00:02:12.068 --> 00:02:16.970
1 and 6 tenths, 1 and 7 tenths,
1 and 8 tenths.

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:22.851
So 1 and 8 tenths is the same thing
as 1.8. 1 and 8 tenths.

00:02:22.851 --> 00:02:25.750
So it's that. But what about
these other options?

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.252
Well one way we could think about
this is-- let's just count the tenths.

00:02:29.252 --> 00:02:31.391
Each of these hash marks is a tenth.

00:02:31.391 --> 00:02:37.534
So 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

00:02:37.534 --> 00:02:40.001
It makes sense. A whole is 10 tenths.

00:02:40.001 --> 00:02:45.871
Let's keep going, we were at 10 tenths.
11 tenths, 12 tenths, 13 tenths,

00:02:45.871 --> 00:02:52.699
14 tenths, 15 tenths,
16 tenths, 17 tenths, 18 tenths.

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:55.492
This one also applies.

00:02:55.492 --> 00:03:00.037
18 hundredths: this would be
between 10 hundredths and 20 hundredths

00:03:00.037 --> 00:03:02.965
which would be the same thing as
between 1 tenth and 2 tenths.

00:03:02.965 --> 00:03:07.201
So 18 hundredths is going to be
someplace around here,

00:03:07.201 --> 00:03:10.164
so I definitely will not select that one.

00:03:10.164 --> 00:03:13.624
Let's try a few more of these.

00:03:13.624 --> 00:03:19.871
So they say "Write a decimal
that is equal to 24 tenths."

00:03:19.871 --> 00:03:24.167
Alright, 24 tenths. So remember
we could view this as--

00:03:24.167 --> 00:03:32.992
I'll just write it down-- we could view
this as 20 tenths plus 4 tenths.

00:03:32.992 --> 00:03:37.732
But what is 20 tenths equal to?

00:03:37.732 --> 00:03:40.867
10 tenths is equal to a whole,

00:03:40.867 --> 00:03:44.139
so 20 tenths is going to be
equal to 2 wholes.

00:03:44.139 --> 00:03:47.526
So this could be viewed
as 2 plus 4 tenths,

00:03:47.526 --> 00:03:51.468
or another way to write this--
we could just write 4 in the tenths place.

00:03:51.468 --> 00:03:54.241
So we could just write this as 2.4.

00:03:54.241 --> 00:04:00.494
24 tenths: 20 tenths are 2 wholes
and then you have another 4 tenths.

00:04:00.494 --> 00:04:03.007
Let's do one other one.

00:04:03.007 --> 00:04:06.200
"102 hundredths."

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:13.633
So we could rewrite this as
100 hundredths plus 2 hundredths.

00:04:16.433 --> 00:04:20.614
Now, what is 100 hundredths?

00:04:20.614 --> 00:04:24.422
Well 100 hundredths
is equal to 1, is equal to a whole.

00:04:24.422 --> 00:04:27.000
So 100 hundredths is just equal to 1.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.338
So you could view this as
1 plus 2 hundredths.

00:04:29.338 --> 00:04:33.684
Another way to write
two hundredths is 0.02.

00:04:33.684 --> 00:04:39.340
So what's 1 plus 0.02?
Well it's just going to be 1.02.

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:43.167
And you see that here.
You have 1 and 2 hundredths.

00:04:43.167 --> 00:04:46.649
1 is the same thing as 100 hundredths.

00:04:46.649 --> 00:04:50.603
So this is 100 hundredths
and you have 2 hundredths

00:04:50.603 --> 00:04:54.963
gives you 102 hundredths.

00:04:54.963 --> 00:04:57.372
Alright, let's do another one.

00:04:57.372 --> 00:05:01.242
"What is 32 tenths written as a decimal?"

00:05:01.242 --> 00:05:04.974
So we just have to remind ourselves:
10 tenths is equal to a whole.

00:05:04.974 --> 00:05:10.652
20 tenths is equal to 2 ones.
30 tenths is equal to 3 ones.

00:05:10.652 --> 00:05:14.404
So this is going to be equal to 3 ones
and then another 2 tenths.

00:05:14.404 --> 00:05:17.875
3 ones and another 2 tenths.

00:05:17.875 --> 00:05:19.615
Let's keep going.

00:05:19.615 --> 00:05:22.506
"What is 203 hundredths
written as a decimal?"

00:05:22.506 --> 00:05:26.616
Well we have to remind ourselves
that 200 hundredths is equal to 2 ones.

00:05:26.616 --> 00:05:30.385
So here this is the same thing as
2 ones and 3 hundredths.

00:05:30.385 --> 00:05:36.274
2 ones-- this case right here--
2 ones and 3 hundredths.

00:05:36.274 --> 00:05:38.121
Let's do a couple more of these.

00:05:38.121 --> 00:05:42.071
"1.05 is equal to how many hundredths?"

00:05:42.078 --> 00:05:46.700
Well, one whole, or 1,
is equal to 100 hundredths.

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:50.045
So this is 100 hundredths
plus 5 hundredths,

00:05:50.045 --> 00:05:53.021
or 105 hundredths.

00:05:53.021 --> 00:05:55.788
Alright. Let's do another one.

00:05:55.788 --> 00:05:59.951
"How can 2.60 be written in words?"

00:05:59.951 --> 00:06:06.393
So I could write this as 2 and 6 tenths.
2 ones and 6 tenths.

00:06:06.393 --> 00:06:11.240
I could also think of this as
2 ones and 60 hundredths.

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:15.062
Or I could view this as 260 hundredths.

00:06:15.062 --> 00:06:16.831
So let's see which of these choices--

00:06:16.831 --> 00:06:19.075
So "2 ones and 6 hundredths"...

00:06:19.075 --> 00:06:23.102
No, no, it's 2 ones and 60 hundredths,
not 6 hundredths.

00:06:23.102 --> 00:06:27.028
It's 6 tenths right over here.
6 tenths or 60 hundredths.

00:06:27.028 --> 00:06:28.477
I won't select that.

00:06:28.477 --> 00:06:30.516
"260 hundredths."

00:06:30.516 --> 00:06:34.025
Yeah, that's right because 2 ones
is that same thing as 200 hundredths

00:06:34.025 --> 00:06:36.766
and then we have another
60 hundredths right over there.

00:06:36.766 --> 00:06:37.883
So that's right.

00:06:37.883 --> 00:06:43.383
"260 tenths." No, 260 tenths--
remember 10 tenths is equal to a whole,

00:06:43.383 --> 00:06:47.029
so 260 tenths would be 26,
would be 26 ones.

00:06:47.029 --> 00:06:49.000
So it's not that choice either.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.538
So anyway, I think we've done
plenty of examples.

00:06:51.538 --> 00:06:53.528
Hopefully you have enjoyed that.
