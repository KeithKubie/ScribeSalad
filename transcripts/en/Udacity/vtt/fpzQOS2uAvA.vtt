00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.450
Here we see an analysis by provider for

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:08.620
the use of lipid lowering drugs for
patients at risk for coronary disease.

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:12.110
This analysis is intended
to help providers

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:17.090
find patients whose treatment may fall
outside of accepted standards of care.

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:19.390
Here's a more detailed analysis.

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:22.230
And an analysis of
the relationship between

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.180
the blood pressure of the patient and
the use of lipid-lowering drugs

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:30.780
illustrating the clinical detail that's
possible when EMR data is made available

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:34.770
in addition to the typical quality
metrics used in population health.
