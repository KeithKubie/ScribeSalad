00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The next protocol I'm going to talk about is called TLS,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
which stands for Transport Layer Security.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
It's also sometimes referred to by it's old name, which was SSL, which was Secure Sockets Layer.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
This is the protocol that was invented by Netscape in 1995 with the goal of enabling clients,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
meaning web browsers and web servers, to be able to communicate securely.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
This is really the essential thing for creating ecommerce.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
It's the protocol that, among other things, allows people to send credit card numbers

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
over the Internet as well as other personal information

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
with some confidence that it's going only to the intended destination.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
It consists of two main parts.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
The first is the Handshake Protocol, and that's used to authenticate a server to a client.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000
It can be in both directions. It can also be used to authenticate clients to servers.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
The way it's used on the web, this rarely happens.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
This would require clients to have public keys that would be known to the servers.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
The other outcomes of the Handshake Protocol

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
are agreement on the cryptographic protocols to use.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
TLS is a very complex protocol that allows many different

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
encryption algorithms to be used for different parts of it.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Part of the handshake is to agree on which one is to use.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
And the final thing is the essential outcome for communication

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.000
to establish a shared session key--a key shared between the server and the client.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
The second part of the TLS protocol is the TLS record protocol.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
That's done after the handshake to enable secured communication

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
between the client and the server

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
using the session key that they established from the handshake.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
The question for this quiz is which one of these two protocols

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
is likely to involve asymmetric cryptography?

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
I haven't described the protocols yet, but based on what they do,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
you should be able to figure out which one is likely to use asymmetric cryptography.
