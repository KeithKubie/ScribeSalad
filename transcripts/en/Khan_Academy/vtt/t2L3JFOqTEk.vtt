00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.970
In the last video we got some
practice adding what we could

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:05.820
consider smaller numbers.

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:10.820
For example, if we added 3 plus
2, we could imagine that if

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:14.830
maybe I had 3 lemons-- 1, 2, 3.

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:20.010
And if I were to add to those
3 lemons maybe 3 lime--

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.700
is it lime or limes?

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:26.900
Well, 2 green lemons or 2
more tart pieces of fruit.

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.220
How much tart, sour
fruit to do I have now?

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.730
Well, we learned in the last
video we have 1, 2, 3,

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.480
4, 5 pieces of fruit.

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.450
So 3 plus 2 is equal to 5.

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.880
And we also saw that that's
the exact same thing

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.320
as if we add 2 plus 3.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.840
And I think that makes sense
because this is the same thing

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.720
as starting with, maybe you
have 2 lemons and you

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.220
add 3 lime to it.

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:54.700
You're still going to end
up with 5 pieces of fruit.

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.710
1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:58.520
Just like that.

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.780
So it doesn't matter what
order you add in, you're

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.070
still going to get 5.

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.690
And this way of thinking about
addition I view as the counting

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:07.070
way of thinking about addition.

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.250
The other thing we saw in the
last video is the number

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.860
line version and they're
essentially the same thing.

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:13.190
So we could draw a line.

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:15.520
And all a number line
is, it lists all of

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.250
the numbers in order.

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.920
It lists all of the numbers
and you can actually go as

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:19.820
high as you need to go.

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.550
You could go up to a million,
gazillion, trillion.

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:25.020
We won't do that; I wouldn't
have space or time in

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.710
this video to do it.

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.200
And you actually can go
as low as possible.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.580
We'll start at 0, assuming-- in
future videos I'll tell you

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.670
about numbers smaller than 0.

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.500
And maybe you can think about
what that might mean tonight.

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.520
But let's start at 0,
and 0 means nothing.

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:44.300
If I have 0 lemons, it
means I have no lemons.

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:56.270
So 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11--

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:57.020
let's go pretty high.

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.360
12.

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.940
That way I can reuse
the number line.

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.910
13, 14, I could keep on going,
but maybe fourteen will

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:05.360
be enough for this video.

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.230
But let's use a number
line for these addition

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:08.900
problems up here.

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:12.300
So in last video, just as a bit
of review, you can view 3 plus

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.440
2 as starting at 3 and
then adding 2 to it.

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.750
Or going 2 greater than 3.

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.770
And just going greater or
adding on the number line is

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:23.320
just moving to the right
or moving up by 2.

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.380
So let's move up by 2.

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.290
I'll do that in
this orange color.

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.510
So let's go up by 2.

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.880
So we started at 3
and we go up by 1.

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.830
And then we go up by
2, or we're jumping,

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:35.970
and we end up at 5.

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.610
Which is exactly
what we got before.

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.990
If we have 3 lemons, we add
one lemon, we have 4 lemons.

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:44.870
We add another lemon, we have 5
lemons or lime or tart pieces

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:46.310
of fruit, whatever you
might want to say.

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.620
And when you look at this
version of it where you

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.800
switched the order, we started
at 2 and we're adding

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.060
3 objects to it.

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.880
In this case, they
were lemons or limes.

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.370
So we're going to add 3 to it.

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.910
1, 2, 3.

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:06.020
And just like we expected,
we got the same thing.

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:08.030
We got 5 again.

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.510
Now what I want to do in video
and hopefully this was just a

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:13.630
bit of review, is I want to
tackle harder problems.

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.970
I want to tackle slightly
larger numbers.

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:18.620
And in this video I want
to just give you practice

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.390
dealing with the
slightly larger numbers.

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:21.840
And then in the next video
we're going to dig a little

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.860
deeper and think about
what numbers even mean.

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:27.590
But let's just get some
practice understanding how do

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:32.880
you actually do the addition
problems with larger numbers?

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.590
Let me write it in a nice,
soothing purple color.

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:44.410
Let's say I wanted
to add 9 plus 3.

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:46.320
Well, there's a couple
of ways we could do it.

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.610
We could draw circles again.

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:49.810
We could say, let's see.

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:51.100
Maybe I'll draw stars.

00:03:51.100 --> 00:04:01.950
1, 2, 3, 4-- my stars are
degradingg-- 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:05.130
That's 9 stars and then
I add 3 stars to it.

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:09.480
So I add 1, 2, 3 stars.

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.550
And then if you were to count
the total number of stars you

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:16.490
would say, let me do that in a
different color-- 1, 2, 3, 4,

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:21.120
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.000
I now have 12 stars.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:29.500
So you would say that 9
plus 3 is equal to 12.

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:33.130
If you looked at the number
line you're starting at 9,

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:37.020
maybe you have 9 stars and
you add one star, two

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.580
star, three stars to that.

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:43.020
And you end up with 12
stars, which is the exact

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:44.760
answer we got before.

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:49.350
So you can do the same process
when you start adding larger

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:52.030
numbers, even though that now--
and I want to you to notice,

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:55.740
the difference now is our
answer has two digits in it.

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.480
We'll talk more about digits
in a future video, but all

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.240
a digit is is a numeral.

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:01.620
It has a 1 and a 2.

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:03.130
That's what 12 is.

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:05.180
I won't dig too deep
into that right now.

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:07.760
I think you're pretty
familiar with the number 12.

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:09.800
But what I want to do is, now
what happens when you start

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:13.210
adding more-- when you
start adding two-digit

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:16.190
numbers like this?

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:30.640
For example, if I were to
add 27 plus let's say--

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:34.140
I don't know-- plus 15.

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:37.650
Now, if you had a lot of time
on your hands and you didn't

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:41.640
care about how people judged
you, you could draw out 27

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:44.880
circles and then draw out
another 15 circles and then

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:47.090
count the total number
of circles you had.

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:48.400
And that would give
you an answer.

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.120
Or you could draw
a number line.

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:53.190
You could draw a number line
that went all the way to know

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:55.060
whatever 27 plus 15 is.

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:56.580
So it's going to be this
really, really large

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:59.100
number, but that would
take you forever.

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:01.130
So what I'm going to do is show
you a way to do this type of

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:04.520
problem where you really just
have to know your addition,

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:06.720
almost have it memorized, or at
least, if you don't have it

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:08.620
memorized, be able to do
something like this for

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:10.090
relatively small numbers.

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:11.990
And by doing it for the
relatively small numbers,

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:15.360
you can do the harder
problems like this.

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:18.160
So what you do, this
is the fun part.

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:21.120
You add, and I'll talk
more about what this

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:22.010
means in the future.

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:24.010
You look at each of the digits.

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:26.760
So we call this place, the
rightmost place, we call

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:28.030
that the 1's place.

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:32.410
And why do we call
that the 1's place?

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:37.810
Because 27 is 20 and seven 1's.

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:39.930
It's 20 plus 7.

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:42.310
It's 20 plus seven 1's.

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:45.360
You could view it as
it's 20 plus 7 pennies.

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:49.830
And this place right here
is called the 10's place.

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:51.180
Now why is it called
the 10's place?

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:52.630
I mean there's a 2 right there.

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:54.790
It's the place that's
called the 10's place.

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:57.740
So putting a 2 here
means two 10's.

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:00.370
The number 20, that's two 10's.

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:03.790
If I have one dime and you gave
me another dime, I now have

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:06.160
two dimes, and that's $0.20.

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:08.120
So that's what the
10's place is.

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:10.160
I don't want to confuse you, I
just want to show you how to

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:11.430
do these problems right now.

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:13.660
We'll dig a little bit
deeper in future videos.

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:15.270
I just want to give
you that idea.

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:18.470
But the way to do these
problems is you look at the

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:21.300
numbers in the 1's place
and add those up first.

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:23.570
So you say, OK, I'm not
going to worry about this

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:24.520
whole thing right now.

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:27.680
Let me just add
the 7 and the 5.

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:30.830
So I'm going to add
the 7 and the 5.

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:33.190
And if you don't know what that
is-- hopefully you'll be able

00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:36.020
to do that in your head fairly
shortly-- you could look

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:37.100
at the number line.

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:39.040
Let's look at the
number line here.

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:43.160
So if you add 7, if you take
7, and you add 5 to it.

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:47.580
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:48.780
We end up at 12.

00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:50.865
Or if you started at
5 and added 7, you'd

00:07:50.865 --> 00:07:52.420
also end up at 12.

00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:53.460
So let's write that down.

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:58.940
We know that 7 plus
5 is equal to 12.

00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:02.690
So what we do is we say 7
plus 5 is equal to-- and

00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:04.410
now this is a new thing.

00:08:04.410 --> 00:08:07.070
It might be a little bit of
a mystery, magical thing

00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:08.050
for you right now.

00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:12.100
And in future videos I'll
explain to you why this works.

00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:13.350
We want to write the 12.

00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:17.300
7 plus 5 is 12, but we
just write the 2 here

00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:19.260
and we carry the 1.

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:19.770
12.

00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:20.870
1 2.

00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:25.040
Well, we wrote the 2 there,
but we put the 1 up here.

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:28.080
And the reason-- I'll give
you a simple reason for

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:28.760
doing that right now.

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:30.570
I'll give you a better
reason in the future.

00:08:30.570 --> 00:08:35.440
Is that you only had space to
put one digit here and 12 is a

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:38.030
two-digit number, so we had
to think of some other

00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:39.280
place to put that 1.

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:42.080
If you really want to think
about it even more, 12 is the

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:45.750
same thing as 10 plus 2.

00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:48.260
That's the same thing as 12.

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:52.290
So if we say 7 plus 5 that's
the same thing as 12, which is

00:08:52.290 --> 00:08:59.050
the same thing as two 1's--
two pennies, plus one dime.

00:08:59.050 --> 00:09:01.000
Plus one 10.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.980
So we put that one dime
in the 10's place.

00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:08.360
So we really just said 7 plus
5 is one 10 plus two 1's.

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:11.005
Or one dime plus two pennies.

00:09:11.005 --> 00:09:15.120
If that confuses you just say,
well, I just write the 1's

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:18.300
digit of the 2 there
and I carry the 1.

00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:20.680
And then you do the exact same
thing in the 10's place.

00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:22.870
You add the 1 plus
the 2 plus the 1.

00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:26.210
So 1 plus 2, let's do
that on a number line.

00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:26.930
This is fun.

00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:27.680
So let's see.

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:29.120
1 plus 2.

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:31.155
Let me do it in a
vibrant color.

00:09:31.155 --> 00:09:32.480
Let me do it in this magenta.

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:33.890
So we start at 1.

00:09:33.890 --> 00:09:35.420
We're going to add 2 to it.

00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:36.680
1 plus 2.

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:38.890
We take that 1 from our 12.

00:09:38.890 --> 00:09:41.340
1 plus 2, so you go up 1, 2.

00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:42.780
You end up at 3.

00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:44.340
Then you're going to
add up another 1.

00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:45.660
So you add another 1.

00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:48.490
You're going to end up at 4.

00:09:48.490 --> 00:09:50.550
So you ended up at 42.

00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:53.050
And this was pretty neat
because we didn't have to

00:09:53.050 --> 00:09:55.020
draw a number line
all the way to 42.

00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:57.100
And we'd didn't have
to draw 42 objects.

00:09:57.100 --> 00:10:01.100
Just by knowing what 7 plus 5
was and by knowing what 1 plus

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:03.720
2 plus 1 was, we were able
to figure out that

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:07.040
27 and 15 is 42.

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:08.080
Let's do another example.

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:10.580
Maybe I'll do a little bit
of a simpler example.

00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:19.440
Let's say I had 78 plus 3.

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:21.250
We do the exact
same thing before.

00:10:21.250 --> 00:10:23.140
We just look at the
1's place only.

00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:26.180
So we look at 8 plus 3.

00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:27.250
What's 8 plus 3?

00:10:27.250 --> 00:10:29.140
Hopefully we can do that in
our heads at this point.

00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:30.390
But let's just think about it.

00:10:30.390 --> 00:10:33.690
8 plus 1 is equal to 9.

00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:36.230
8 plus 2 is equal to 10.

00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:38.420
8 plus 3 is going
to be equal to 11.

00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:40.580
You could do that on the number
line if it makes it easier

00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:42.150
to visualize for you.

00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:45.000
So 8 plus 3 is equal to 11.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:50.490
So what we do here, we just
have 8 plus 3 is equal to 11.

00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:54.810
Put this 1 right here, put that
there, and carry the other 1.

00:10:54.810 --> 00:10:58.610
Because 11 is one 10, one
dime plus one penny.

00:10:58.610 --> 00:10:59.620
That's 11.

00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:01.790
And then we add the 10's place.

00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:06.450
1 dime plus 7 dimes
is equal to 8 dimes.

00:11:06.450 --> 00:11:10.720
So 78 plus 3 is equal to 81.

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:12.080
And now there's one thing
I want to show you.

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:15.320
You don't always have to
carry numbers like that.

00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:17.640
Only if the answer to
one of these has more

00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:19.250
than one digit in it.

00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:21.080
11 is a two-digit number.

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:28.200
So for example, if
I have 56 plus 2.

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:31.590
Here I could just
say 6 plus 2 is 8.

00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:34.430
Hopefully we're getting
good practice at this.

00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:36.530
So 6 plus 2 is 8.

00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:39.800
And then, I don't have anything
to add this 5 to, so I just

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:41.150
bring the 5 down here.

00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:44.150
So 56 plus 2 is 58.

00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:45.270
Just like that.

00:11:45.270 --> 00:11:46.815
And this is one you actually
could have drawn on

00:11:46.815 --> 00:11:47.320
the number line.

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:48.820
It wouldn't have been too hard.

00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:51.480
So if you were to draw the
number line like that, you

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:53.790
know 0 would be way off
to the left some place.

00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:55.890
But let's say I had 50.

00:11:55.890 --> 00:12:00.000
49, you could keep going to the
left, but you have 51, 52,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.820
actually let me start a little
higher than that because I'm

00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:04.060
going to run out of space.

00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:11.880
Let me start at maybe 55, 56,
57, 58, 59, and I could go in

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:14.030
both directions, keep going.

00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:17.350
But if we start at 56 right
there and we add 2, we

00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:19.700
go up one, we go up two.

00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:21.060
We end up at 58.

00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:23.960
So just like that we're
able to do that problem.

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:26.070
I'll see you in the next video.
