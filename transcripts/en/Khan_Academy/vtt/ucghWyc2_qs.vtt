00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:04.210
Part C, find the
average value of f

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:07.100
on the interval negative 1 to 1.

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:09.020
So the average
value of a function

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:11.410
over an interval is just
going to be-- so let's

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:13.030
just write average.

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:14.800
The average value
of our function

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:19.525
is just going to be the integral
over the interval negative 1

00:00:19.525 --> 00:00:27.200
to 1 of f of x, d of x,
divided by our change in x.

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.740
Sorry, this is from
negative 1 to 1.

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.120
And our change in x
is 1 minus negative 1.

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.810
So this is going to be equal
to 1/2 times the integral.

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:47.579
And here, f of x is
piecewise-defined.

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.370
So what we can do is
break up this integral

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:50.430
into two intervals.

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.655
We can say the integral
of f of x from negative 1

00:00:53.655 --> 00:00:58.900
to 0 of f of x dx plus-- let
me just write it this way

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:02.540
so we don't have to
keep rewriting the 1/2.

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.810
I'll use brackets--
plus the integral

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:11.530
from 0 to 1 of f of x dx.

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:13.380
And the reason why I
broke it up like this

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.770
is because this function
has a different definition,

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.150
or it's piecewise-defined.

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.460
It's different when we're
less than or equal to 0,

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.730
versus when we are
greater than 0.

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:28.090
So that's why I like to
break it up this way.

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.990
So then we get, this
is equal to 1/2 times--

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.260
and in big brackets like this.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.180
This first part
right over here, we

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.980
can write as the integral
from negative 1 to 0.

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:43.300
What is f of x between
negative 1 and 0?

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:51.010
It's 1 minus 2 sine of x dx.

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:54.420
And then plus this
thing right over here.

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.550
Plus the integral from 0 to 1.

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:02.500
And what is our function
when it's between 0 and 1?

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:08.259
It's e to the negative 4x dx.

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.660
And now we can do each of
these integrals separately.

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:16.080
And so this is going
to be equal to 1/2--

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.270
and once again, I'll do a big
open bracket right over here.

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:22.070
My pen is getting loose, let me
tie on the front a little bit

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.570
better.

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:23.570
There you go.

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:25.140
All right, back to work.

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.830
So 1/2, open brackets.

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:28.690
And now, let's take
the antiderivative

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.640
of 1 minus 2 sine
of x, antiderivative

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.870
of 1 with respect
to x is just x.

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:36.250
Negative 2 sine of x.

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.770
Well, the derivative of cosine
of x is negative sine of x.

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:44.210
So this is just going
to be 2 cosine of x.

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:45.670
And you can verify that.

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:47.670
Derivative of cosine of
x is negative sine of x.

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.640
You have the 2 out front, so
it's negative 2 sine of x.

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.890
So we're going to evaluate
that at 0 and at negative 1.

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.980
And to that, we
are going to add--

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.350
so let's do this definite
integral over here.

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:05.480
The antiderivative of
e to the negative 4x

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:13.220
is going to be equal to negative
e to the negative 4x over 4.

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.390
And the way you realize that is,
if this was just an e to the x,

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:20.070
then it's antiderivative
would just be e to the x.

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:22.640
If you have an e
to the negative 4x,

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:25.130
then you know that whatever
its antiderivative is

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:29.740
is going to be, essentially,
an e to the negative 4x.

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:31.510
But when you take
its derivative,

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:33.301
you're going to have
to take the derivative

00:03:33.301 --> 00:03:35.600
of the negative 4x part
because of the chain rule.

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.000
And so you're going to have
a negative 4 that comes out.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.480
But we don't see a
negative 4 over here,

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.520
so we're obviously going to
have to divide by negative 4

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:45.710
so it cancels out.

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:47.900
Another way to
think about it is,

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.930
we could have rewritten
we this thing.

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:55.720
So this is equal to e
to the negative 4x dx.

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.280
This is exactly
what our problem is,

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.299
what we need to take
the definite integral.

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:01.840
So then, it becomes
completely clear.

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.340
So that the derivative of this
thing is sitting around here,

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.810
we could put a
negative 4 over here.

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:09.920
But you can't just willy-nilly
throw a negative 4 there.

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.850
You would have to put a
negative 1/4 outside of it

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:17.029
in order for it to be
negative 1/4 times negative 4.

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:20.250
You're just multiplying by 1,
which doesn't change the value.

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:26.370
And then here, you'd clearly
see that this right over here

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:30.470
is the derivative of
e to the negative 4x.

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:32.930
So that you'd have e
to the negative 4x.

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:35.110
The antiderivative of this
is e to the negative 4x.

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:37.560
And then you have this
negative 1/4 over here.

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.867
So either way, hopefully
that makes sense.

00:04:40.867 --> 00:04:42.450
We go into more
detail of that earlier

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:43.999
in the calculus playlist.

00:04:43.999 --> 00:04:46.040
So then this is from--
we're going to evaluate it

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:54.830
at 1 and at 0, and then we
want to close the brackets.

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:56.340
And so, what do we have here?

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:57.540
This is equal to 1/2.

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:00.090
Once again, open the brackets.

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:02.140
If you evaluate
all of this at 0,

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:04.830
you get 0 plus 2 cosine of 0.

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:06.630
Cosine of 0 is 1.

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:09.580
So you just get a 2 when
you evaluate it at the 0.

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:11.030
So you get a 2.

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:13.450
And then from that, we
want to subtract whatever

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:16.530
we get when we evaluate
it at negative 1.

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:21.790
We want to subtract negative
1 plus 2 cosine of negative 1.

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:28.310
So this whole thing
right over here

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:31.240
evaluates to this whole
thing right over there.

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.670
And then we have plus.

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:36.400
We want to evaluate this at 1.

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:41.530
So this gives us negative
e to the negative 4.

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:46.620
Because negative 4x, when
x is 1, is negative 4.

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:47.730
Over 4.

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:49.670
And from that, we
need to subtract

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:51.090
this thing evaluated at 0.

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:59.430
So that's going to be
negative e to the 0 over 4.

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:00.850
e to the 0 is 1.

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:04.790
So that's just
negative 1 over 4.

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:09.390
And once again, all of this is
going to be multiplied by 1/2.

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:11.710
And now we just
have to simplify it.

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:14.500
So this is equal to-- well, I'll
just still throw out the 1/2

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:15.000
here.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.320
This is equal to 1/2 times--
so I'll do this in a new color

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:19.820
here.

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:22.070
Let me do it-- well I don't
have too many new colors.

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:22.830
OK.

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:25.440
So this is equal to 2 plus 1.

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:28.820
So this and this together
is going to be equal to 3.

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:31.390
And then you have
this negative outside.

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:33.310
So that's why it was a plus 1.

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:35.930
And then you have a
negative times a positive 2.

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:39.750
So minus 2 cosine of negative 1.

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:42.290
And then you have
plus-- or maybe I

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:47.210
should say minus-- minus e
to the negative 4 over 4.

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:48.880
And then you have plus 1/4.

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:54.340
And then we want to
close our brackets.

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:57.390
And then we could do one last
step of simplification here.

00:06:57.390 --> 00:07:00.270
3, we could add
the 3 to the 1/4.

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:02.886
3 is the same
thing as 12 over 4.

00:07:02.886 --> 00:07:06.870
12 over 4 plus 1/4 is 13/4.

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:14.190
So you have 13/4 minus 2
cosine of negative 1 minus

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:16.680
e to the negative 4 over 4.

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:19.970
And then, of course, you have
your 1/2 sitting out here.

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:23.100
And it's not the most
beautiful or simple thing.

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:24.210
But this is our answer.

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:28.430
This is the average value of
f of x over that interval.
