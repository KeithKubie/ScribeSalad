NILE RODGERS: Hey, I'm
Nile Rodgers, and thanks

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:12.657
for watching Talks at Google.

00:00:12.657 --> 00:00:14.740
ANANT SHUKLA: Joining us
today, with his Hitmaker,

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:16.698
please give a warm welcome
to Mr. Nile Rodgers.

00:00:16.698 --> 00:00:19.150
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:26.990
NILE RODGERS: How you doing?

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:30.110
How you doing?

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:31.110
How are you?

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.340
ANANT SHUKLA: So Nile,
welcome to Google.

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.341
NILE RODGERS: Thank you.

00:00:39.341 --> 00:00:41.423
ANANT SHUKLA: Today, we're
going talk a little bit

00:00:41.423 --> 00:00:43.780
about your background, your
music, your FOLD festival,

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:44.590
obviously.

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:46.190
NILE RODGERS: That's triple
Grammy winner, by the way.

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:47.106
ANANT SHUKLA: Exactly.

00:00:47.106 --> 00:00:47.712
Exactly.

00:00:47.712 --> 00:00:49.420
NILE RODGERS: I was
like, Grammy winning?

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:50.410
Triple Grammy.

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:54.010
Dude, it took me all
those years and do it.

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:55.700
No, sorry, go ahead.

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.060
ANANT SHUKLA: We brought
the Hitmaker along as well,

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:59.039
your trusty sidekick.

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.580
So why don't you
just get us started,

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:01.730
tell us a little bit
about how you first

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:02.720
got involved in music.

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:06.448
And during your childhood,
how did that influence you?

00:01:06.448 --> 00:01:10.789
NILE RODGERS: Well,
we're in a neighborhood

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:12.830
that's actually just a
few blocks away from where

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:13.880
I was born.

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:20.340
And back in the day when
dinosaurs walked the earth,

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.140
music was part of the
standardized American

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:24.100
curriculum.

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.600
So they taught music in school.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:32.000
I learned how to read music in
school, and I just kept going.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.280
It was one of the few things
that I actually liked doing.

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:44.200
And before I knew it, I was
doing it professionally.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.520
I played in various
high school orchestras,

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.240
in junior high
school orchestras.

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:54.470
And my first professional
job was with "Sesame Street."

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:58.230
I was probably around 17,
18, something like that.

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:00.300
And then I went
from "Sesame Street"

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.150
to the Apollo
Theater in one year.

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:09.190
And about a year after I
worked at the Apollo Theater,

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.820
I wound up going on the road
with a group called New York

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:14.140
City.

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.950
And we were the opening act
for the Jackson 5 for a bit.

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:25.150
And a few years after that,
I wrote my first single,

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.620
and it was a hit.

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.550
But I didn't get a
Grammy, but it was a hit.

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.260
Sold millions of copies.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.840
And then my second record
was a hit, and my third,

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.950
and my fourth, and my
fifth, and my sixth.

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.800
And what was really interesting,
it hit me the other day

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:49.079
that I didn't work with a star
until I worked with Diana Ross.

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:51.120
And that was the first
time I worked with a star,

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.500
and it was like a
super, super, superstar.

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.600
And by the time I
worked with Diana Ross,

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.730
I actually didn't even
have to work again.

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:02.676
I could have just quit
the music business

00:03:02.676 --> 00:03:03.800
and lived off of royalties.

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.240
Ah, the good old days when we--
the time when we used to get

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.740
paid, you know?

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:10.911
I mean, I really could have.

00:03:10.911 --> 00:03:12.410
Because at that
point, I had already

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:16.020
written "We Are Family,"
which was a huge copyright,

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:18.590
and "The Freak"
and "Good Times."

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.160
And then Sugarhill
Gang sampled that

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.450
and gave me "Rapper's Delight."

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:30.140
I think the suggested
retail price

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:35.900
for "Rapper's Delight" was $1.98
for one song, for a single.

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:39.480
Or no, it was $2.99,
so it was ridiculous.

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.580
After "Rapper's Delight,"
I honestly could have said,

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:45.500
OK, I'm hanging up my guns, and
I'm going to watch the world.

00:03:47.715 --> 00:03:50.090
ANANT SHUKLA: Your family was
also always very supportive

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.670
of music.

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.540
You were surrounded, as
a child, by musicians.

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.440
Did they push you
one way or the other?

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.320
Or just organically, like you
said, one step after another,

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:02.050
and it just kept going?

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:05.040
NILE RODGERS: You're
really funny, man.

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.080
Did they push me?

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.690
No, my parents were
heroin addicts.

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:16.410
They were loving and wonderful,
but were not exactly motivated

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:23.340
or motivators, but
they were awfully cool.

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:29.450
My stepfather was maybe one of
the coolest guys I've ever met,

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:33.990
but they were full-time
heroin addicts.

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:37.720
And so I had to motivate myself.

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.230
The reason why I had
such cool jobs, I think,

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:43.070
is because I started
working at a young age.

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:48.730
I had a very powerful work
ethic that hasn't diminished

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:51.030
one bit to this very day.

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:57.720
So you know, I actually
think it was natural for me

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.740
to have a full-time
job at "Sesame

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:01.279
Street" at 19 years old.

00:05:01.279 --> 00:05:02.070
ANANT SHUKLA: Yeah.

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:04.580
And you also moved
between New York and LA.

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:08.960
The opportunities arose
naturally there as well.

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:11.380
NILE RODGERS: Yeah,
I was bi-coastal,

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:17.930
and it was mainly because
I wasn't a legal adult.

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:22.840
So I had to live with
some parental figure,

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:30.270
so I moved to California to
live with my grandparents

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:32.480
on different occasions.

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:39.020
But my childhood was so
weird, because I usually

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:42.270
was the only something
in the school.

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:46.960
So I was baptized Roman
Catholic, so I started out

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:48.430
at Catholic school.

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:51.580
And because of the neighborhood
that I was living in,

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:56.230
I would be the only
black person in my class.

00:05:56.230 --> 00:06:00.130
That was the same in New
York as well as Los Angeles.

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:04.110
So when I got to Los
Angeles, my first trip,

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:06.140
I was seven years old.

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:07.730
I felt very uncomfortable.

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:10.500
I felt like I didn't belong.

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:14.250
But I found that there
was one place I really

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:17.220
did belong, movie theaters.

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:19.940
And Los Angeles
had lots of them.

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:26.330
And I played hooky
for 75 days straight.

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:30.960
I set the national truancy
record for parochial school

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:32.780
at seven years old,
and I was kicked out

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:35.360
of the parochial school system.

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:36.860
That's actually my
proudest-- forget

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:40.550
the triple Grammys,
75 days straight

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:44.260
without getting caught.

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:45.940
And you may wonder,
how did I do that.

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:50.250
Well, in Catholic school, they
give you money, an offering

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:51.199
to give in every day.

00:06:51.199 --> 00:06:53.240
And I take that money,
and I would pay off a wino

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:54.430
and say, write a note.

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:58.600
Because I knew that a wino,
even a really inebriated one,

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:02.570
his handwriting looked a hell
of a lot better than mine.

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:06.140
And I would give that
to whatever authority

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:07.750
figure I'd run into.

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:08.980
Excuse my son Nile.

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:12.182
He has asthma and, he took
off the first half of the day

00:07:12.182 --> 00:07:13.640
because he had a
really high fever.

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:15.690
But he feels great
now, so he would

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:21.260
like to go see all
of those movies

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:24.080
that you have playing
in your theater.

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:26.080
And I did that every single day.

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:29.890
And I really got
bold when I-- I know

00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:31.480
I'm going way off topic here.

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:34.410
But I really got bold one day,
because I just wanted to see,

00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:36.250
could I really get
away with this.

00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:38.750
So I walked up to
police officers,

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:40.720
and I whipped out my note.

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:42.800
That note was like gold.

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:44.320
Whipped out the note.

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:47.080
And I said, I'm
suffering from asthma,

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:49.990
but, you know, the
attack went away.

00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:52.940
And now I got a
few hours to kill,

00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:55.596
and I want to go see this
movie, but I don't know

00:07:55.596 --> 00:07:56.720
if I can get there in time.

00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:58.178
And the cops said,
we'll drive you.

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:03.270
It was so cool.

00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:06.570
So those were the
good old days in LA.

00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:09.090
But then after they caught
me, they kicked me out,

00:08:09.090 --> 00:08:10.950
and I came back to New York.

00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:14.120
And I went to school
here for a while.

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:21.860
And it's so different,
because in those days,

00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:23.320
we were really romantic.

00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:28.310
Everything-- like, the next
day was going to be heaven.

00:08:28.310 --> 00:08:32.900
And so coming back to
New York to go to school

00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:36.630
was really weird, because in
LA, school was going to movies.

00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:41.159
In New York, school
was dreadful.

00:08:41.159 --> 00:08:45.180
But somehow I made really
great friends, did well,

00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:46.900
and I learned to play music.

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:48.100
ANANT SHUKLA: That's what I was
going to ask you next though.

00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:50.980
Where did the guitar, then,
fit in on this journey?

00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:53.990
When did you realize the guitar
was the instrument for you?

00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:56.050
NILE RODGERS: So it was
all about the culture.

00:08:56.050 --> 00:08:59.250
So at the time, they were
teaching classical music

00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:01.760
in school, which I
love, by the way.

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:06.020
And the last instrument that
I played classical music on

00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:07.630
was the clarinet.

00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:11.840
And the b-flat clarinet,
the written range

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:14.020
is the same as the guitar.

00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:22.120
So I grew up during the hippie
anti-war years, you know,

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:23.136
that sort of thing.

00:09:23.136 --> 00:09:28.060
The early '70s, late
'60s, that was my era.

00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:32.140
I don't really know any
cool hippie anti-war

00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:33.780
songs on the clarinet.

00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:38.383
I can see Woody Guthrie with
the clarinet, do-do, do-do.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:49.740
So it was definitely
not the instrument,

00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:51.250
the anti-war instrument.

00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:54.220
So I picked up the guitar.

00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:56.000
And the fact that it
was the same written

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.620
range as the
clarinet was amazing,

00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:01.600
because now I had
tons of books that

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:04.980
had been provided for me in
the wonderful school system.

00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:07.290
And I had lots of
etudes to practice.

00:10:07.290 --> 00:10:12.090
And guitar players are
notoriously bad music readers.

00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:18.830
And that gave me a serious
one-up on almost all the studio

00:10:18.830 --> 00:10:20.080
players here in New York City.

00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:22.320
So I was playing on
records right away.

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:24.960
I was gigging instantly.

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:27.150
As soon as people had
found out that, hey,

00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:30.040
we got that guy with the weird
hair, and he can read music.

00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:32.360
Hire him to do your
television commercials.

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:33.600
I was making money.

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:38.862
So 16, 17 years old, I
was very self-sufficient.

00:10:38.862 --> 00:10:40.820
ANANT SHUKLA: You were
gigging with the greats.

00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:44.127
I read the story about
you and Jimi Hendrix.

00:10:44.127 --> 00:10:44.960
What was that story?

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:47.000
Or were there other
idols and mentors

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.000
during that phase that--

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:48.750
NILE RODGERS: Yes.

00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:55.430
So on 8th Street, between
6th and MacDougle,

00:10:55.430 --> 00:10:57.140
Jimi Hendrix was
building his studio.

00:10:57.140 --> 00:11:00.040
Matter of fact, that's where
I recorded "Random Access

00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:02.660
Memories" with Daft Punk.

00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:06.920
When he was building that
studio, it was-- prior to him

00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:10.270
building it, it was-- a
nightclub called Generation.

00:11:10.270 --> 00:11:12.810
And we used to jam at
Generation all the time.

00:11:12.810 --> 00:11:15.590
And when Hendrix was in the
neighborhood doing the studio,

00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:18.780
you would see him around,
jamming in different clubs.

00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:22.350
So in the old days, we
didn't have Doppler radar.

00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:23.780
And I remember,
one day, my band,

00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:25.567
we were working
at the Bitter End.

00:11:25.567 --> 00:11:27.650
And we had no-- we knew
that it was going to snow,

00:11:27.650 --> 00:11:31.380
but we had no idea it
was going to snow snow.

00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:33.420
It was so much snow
it was like a joke.

00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:35.060
You'd try to open
the door, and it was

00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:37.220
like the snow was that high.

00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:39.065
So we went over to
this guy's loft.

00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:46.510
And the loft was a loft
slash recording studio slash

00:11:46.510 --> 00:11:51.250
macrobiotic restaurant slash
political headquarters slash

00:11:51.250 --> 00:11:52.630
whatever, you know.

00:11:52.630 --> 00:11:55.730
And we went over, and
we started jamming.

00:11:55.730 --> 00:11:57.920
And Jimi walked in and
started jamming with us.

00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:00.120
And we all had this
big, groovy circle

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:05.610
of everybody just doing a
freestyle jam like in the movie

00:12:05.610 --> 00:12:09.440
"Spinal Tap," like, hey man,
when we do our freestyle.

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:11.330
So anyway, we were
just freestyle jamming,

00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:12.205
and it was wonderful.

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:20.940
I believe that the
composition we improvised

00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:23.710
was brilliant and genius.

00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:29.060
I was on acid and so was
everybody else in the room,

00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:34.610
so everybody else believed it
was brilliant and genius too.

00:12:34.610 --> 00:12:37.120
And the thing that was funny
is we were just jamming,

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:41.850
and everybody went to the same
tonal centers, and we got it,

00:12:41.850 --> 00:12:43.660
and it was a perfect jam.

00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:47.410
And then, finally, as the
whole groove backed down,

00:12:47.410 --> 00:12:53.400
right to complete tacit, we
hear this voice come out.

00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:57.400
And it was Jimi, and he
went, uh, did anybody record

00:12:57.400 --> 00:13:00.160
that man?

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:02.340
The recording engineer was
standing right next to me

00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:03.374
with a bass.

00:13:03.374 --> 00:13:05.110
It was like, well, I guess not.

00:13:07.810 --> 00:13:10.950
So you know, that that's
how it was around here.

00:13:10.950 --> 00:13:12.510
This is such an
awesome neighborhood.

00:13:12.510 --> 00:13:15.100
It was such a great childhood.

00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:19.600
And it really gave me the tools.

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:21.570
Like, I didn't know
that I'd wind up-- I

00:13:21.570 --> 00:13:26.110
knew I'd probably be a composer,
maybe a conductor, an arranger.

00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:31.030
But I didn't know that I'd be
a producer, which, basically,

00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:33.450
is the same as the
director of a film.

00:13:33.450 --> 00:13:35.550
It's your job, it's
your responsibility

00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:37.470
to bring in the
finished product.

00:13:37.470 --> 00:13:39.130
So you're the coach.

00:13:39.130 --> 00:13:40.940
You're the psychologist.

00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:44.160
You're everything, because
you hire the people,

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:45.750
you fire the people.

00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:50.230
And typically, when I produce,
I really run the show.

00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:53.762
A lot of times I do records,
the artist, who's the star,

00:13:53.762 --> 00:13:55.470
they don't even know
the other people who

00:13:55.470 --> 00:13:57.070
are playing on their record.

00:13:57.070 --> 00:13:59.910
And that's because I come
from the old school of studio

00:13:59.910 --> 00:14:02.260
musicians where we
would just show up,

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:03.860
and people wouldn't know me.

00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:05.529
A contractor would bring me in.

00:14:05.529 --> 00:14:07.820
And they would say, who's
that guy with the weird hair,

00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:09.278
because I've always
had weird hair.

00:14:09.278 --> 00:14:11.590
Who's that dude with the
green hair and the corn rows

00:14:11.590 --> 00:14:12.719
and the thing coming out.

00:14:12.719 --> 00:14:13.260
I don't know.

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:18.970
He's Nile, but he can read
music really well, so let's see.

00:14:18.970 --> 00:14:24.010
So I still make
records, on some level,

00:14:24.010 --> 00:14:25.950
like the old-school school way.

00:14:25.950 --> 00:14:30.570
I think there's a certain
excitement and enthusiasm when

00:14:30.570 --> 00:14:31.900
you don't know the music.

00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:34.180
You're completely
unfamiliar, and you're

00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:38.320
trying to make the
contractor, or the artist,

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:42.960
or whomever is responsible for
you being in that seat happy.

00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:44.370
So I treat everybody like that.

00:14:44.370 --> 00:14:48.590
I mean, if you're a big
star, that's it, usually.

00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:50.780
I got a phone call today.

00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:53.587
I just wrote a song
for a really big star.

00:14:53.587 --> 00:14:55.920
The head of her record company
called me and said, Nile,

00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:56.810
this shit's amazing.

00:14:56.810 --> 00:14:57.770
This is so good.

00:14:57.770 --> 00:14:58.520
This is great.

00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:00.050
She's in town for
the next few days.

00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:02.360
Maybe you guys can
finish the song.

00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:05.700
But someone else,
another really big star,

00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:08.990
wants to work on the record with
you, and she's in Australia.

00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:10.860
What do we do?

00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:12.940
I'm going, dude, you're
the record company.

00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:14.280
What do we do?

00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:16.650
I like this record so much.

00:15:16.650 --> 00:15:20.310
If she doesn't do her part,
let's finish it by the weekend.

00:15:20.310 --> 00:15:23.450
And I said, well, I'm fine.

00:15:23.450 --> 00:15:28.750
I love the challenge of
waking up and knowing

00:15:28.750 --> 00:15:31.060
that your situation
is impossible,

00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:34.380
and somehow, at the end
of the day, going, man,

00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:36.892
this sounds like a hit record.

00:15:36.892 --> 00:15:38.600
ANANT SHUKLA: So you've
beaten addiction.

00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:40.120
You've beaten cancer.

00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:41.800
Did you ever think that--

00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:42.990
NILE RODGERS: Beaten it?

00:15:42.990 --> 00:15:44.312
Temporarily just--

00:15:44.312 --> 00:15:46.160
ANANT SHUKLA: Knock
on-- hopefully, right?

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:49.000
Did you ever think you were
going to give up music and try

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.940
something else?

00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:52.822
Are there other
passions that you were

00:15:52.822 --> 00:15:54.030
trying to pursue on the side?

00:15:54.030 --> 00:15:58.910
NILE RODGERS: Well, I
didn't give up music.

00:15:58.910 --> 00:16:00.900
I can't do that,
I don't believe.

00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:03.820
I think it's really in my DNA.

00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:05.180
It's just who I am.

00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:13.170
But I did realize I had some
sort of talent for writing.

00:16:13.170 --> 00:16:16.870
I wrote my memoir,
which people love.

00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:18.960
I've turned down
God knows how many

00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:25.339
filmmakers who've wanted to do
the story, really famous ones.

00:16:25.339 --> 00:16:26.880
And the only reason
why I did that is

00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:31.950
because I've chosen to do
it as a Broadway show first.

00:16:31.950 --> 00:16:35.310
So I've already
completed act one.

00:16:35.310 --> 00:16:37.160
We read last week.

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:44.620
And my producer said it was the
best cold reading of a musical

00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:46.380
he's ever heard in his life.

00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:51.600
He says, Jesus Christ, most
people would end act one with

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:52.500
"We Are Family."

00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:55.180
You start your show with it.

00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:56.730
And he's like, what
else is coming?

00:16:56.730 --> 00:16:59.490
And it was hit after
hit after hit after hit.

00:16:59.490 --> 00:17:01.570
And he was like, phew.

00:17:01.570 --> 00:17:06.410
So I just said, well,
that's the story arc.

00:17:06.410 --> 00:17:08.990
The songs support the story arc.

00:17:08.990 --> 00:17:11.760
And that's how I hear it.

00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:13.153
ANANT SHUKLA: Yeah.

00:17:13.153 --> 00:17:14.569
Well, one of your
latest projects,

00:17:14.569 --> 00:17:16.745
you've moved into music
festivals now, right?

00:17:16.745 --> 00:17:18.920
So the FOLD festival
now in its second year

00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:21.020
here in Long Island,
debuting in London.

00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:24.915
You're working with Kesha,
Joe Jonas, Bette Midler.

00:17:24.915 --> 00:17:26.540
NILE RODGERS: Yeah,
Earth, Wind &amp; Fire.

00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:27.623
ANANT SHUKLA: KC and the--

00:17:27.623 --> 00:17:29.710
NILE RODGERS: KC and the
Sun-- Village People.

00:17:29.710 --> 00:17:31.460
ANANT SHUKLA: How did
you pick the lineup?

00:17:31.460 --> 00:17:33.782
And how did FOLD come
to be what it is today?

00:17:33.782 --> 00:17:34.490
NILE RODGERS: OK.

00:17:34.490 --> 00:17:37.090
So the way that
FOLD originated was,

00:17:37.090 --> 00:17:39.610
four years ago, I was in
Montreux, Switzerland,

00:17:39.610 --> 00:17:42.090
and they wanted to
give me an award.

00:17:42.090 --> 00:17:43.690
I was going, I don't understand.

00:17:43.690 --> 00:17:45.440
Well, actually, what
we really want to do,

00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:47.530
Nile, is we want to honor you.

00:17:47.530 --> 00:17:50.550
I was going, wait a minute.

00:17:50.550 --> 00:17:52.900
The last time I was
here and we honored

00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:55.700
somebody, what happened?

00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:58.320
I said that guy went to
a Rolling Stones concert.

00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:00.790
Afterwards, he fell down
the steps, and he died.

00:18:00.790 --> 00:18:01.430
No way.

00:18:01.430 --> 00:18:02.270
Don't honor me.

00:18:02.270 --> 00:18:04.940
That's what you do at the
end of a person's career.

00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:07.277
I says, why don't
we honor the music?

00:18:07.277 --> 00:18:08.860
And they said, well,
what do you mean?

00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:11.150
I said, why don't we
honor the music that

00:18:11.150 --> 00:18:13.140
makes you want to honor me?

00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:16.280
He didn't quite get the concept,
but I called Mark Ronson,

00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:18.186
Grace Jones, a bunch of people.

00:18:18.186 --> 00:18:19.810
And I called a bunch
of friends, and we

00:18:19.810 --> 00:18:26.690
put on an 11-hour
festival of dance music.

00:18:26.690 --> 00:18:30.010
Like, we did a festival
within the jazz festival.

00:18:30.010 --> 00:18:34.360
And it was so incredibly
successful, I'm

00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:35.569
chasing that high again.

00:18:35.569 --> 00:18:37.360
I don't know if I could
ever pull that off,

00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:39.641
but it was just unbelievable.

00:18:42.470 --> 00:18:46.840
And I think the thing that
makes FOLD really unique

00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:49.730
is that you can tell that
we all love each other.

00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:52.600
Like, when you go to a
concert, even though we're all

00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:54.622
competitive-- you know,
you go out and go,

00:18:54.622 --> 00:18:55.705
yeah, we smoked so-and-so.

00:18:55.705 --> 00:18:56.205
Ha ha.

00:18:56.205 --> 00:18:57.104
Ha ha.

00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:03.446
There's a great story.

00:19:03.446 --> 00:19:08.750
Well, no, It's just too cool.

00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:14.850
So I will not mention
artist A, but artist A

00:19:14.850 --> 00:19:18.560
decided they wanted to be
the star and get top billing,

00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:23.450
and Rick James was not the star.

00:19:23.450 --> 00:19:26.510
And Rick James went
out and smoked.

00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:28.680
And as he was going back
to his dressing room,

00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:29.900
he went, your turn.

00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:36.130
So we all have that thing.

00:19:36.130 --> 00:19:39.850
But at my FOLD festival, because
everybody, we're all friends,

00:19:39.850 --> 00:19:41.680
we're not trying to
smoke the other person.

00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:43.770
We're actually trying
to lift each other up.

00:19:43.770 --> 00:19:48.610
So it's become this thing
where the people feel the vibe.

00:19:48.610 --> 00:19:50.430
The bands feel the vibe.

00:19:50.430 --> 00:19:51.400
It's incredible.

00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:54.710
Last year Pharrell said,
I've never had so much fun.

00:19:54.710 --> 00:19:56.350
Janell Monet-- incredible.

00:19:56.350 --> 00:19:57.560
Chaka Khan.

00:19:57.560 --> 00:20:00.930
Keith Richards and-- Keith
Richards-- whoa-- Keith Urban

00:20:00.930 --> 00:20:03.570
and I-- Keith Richards--
Keith Urban and I

00:20:03.570 --> 00:20:05.460
turned it into Woodstock.

00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:08.180
We just went off and started
jamming for 15 minutes.

00:20:10.910 --> 00:20:13.580
So that's what I'm
trying to build on,

00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:16.174
that old festival
feeling where--

00:20:16.174 --> 00:20:18.590
ANANT SHUKLA: Because you went
to Woodstock as a teenager.

00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:19.250
NILE RODGERS: Yeah,
boy, I was a kid.

00:20:19.250 --> 00:20:22.330
ANANT SHUKLA: You performed
at Line Aid-- Live Aid, sorry.

00:20:22.330 --> 00:20:25.590
Did those festivals
influence you in shaping FOLD

00:20:25.590 --> 00:20:27.292
and how it is today?

00:20:27.292 --> 00:20:30.560
NILE RODGERS: It was
a little different.

00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:34.450
At Woodstock, I was a
kid, so I wasn't going

00:20:34.450 --> 00:20:35.700
to be invited up on the stage.

00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:37.010
That's for sure.

00:20:37.010 --> 00:20:41.690
But at Live Aid, yeah,
Live Aid, I played.

00:20:41.690 --> 00:20:44.150
It's actually a
great, funny story.

00:20:44.150 --> 00:20:46.295
Oh man, how much
time do we have?

00:20:46.295 --> 00:20:47.420
ANANT SHUKLA: You got time.

00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:49.240
Don't worry.

00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:51.900
NILE RODGERS: This is funny.

00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:52.780
OK.

00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:54.460
So Live Aid, here we are.

00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:57.800
Live Aid, getting
ready to go on stage.

00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:00.220
Right before we go on
stage, Lionel Ritchie

00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:01.960
calls us all in a room.

00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:04.380
And if you look at
the video of Live--

00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:06.190
it's like every big star.

00:21:06.190 --> 00:21:09.860
Like, Madonna, blah,
ah-- I mean, everybody.

00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:11.420
Calls us all in a room.

00:21:11.420 --> 00:21:15.715
And he says, you know, we
have a great sound engineer,

00:21:15.715 --> 00:21:20.080
Bob Clearmountain, who happened
to be my normal sound engineer.

00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:21.360
I'm with him every day.

00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:26.580
Yeah, he is great, but he's Bob.

00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:29.920
He says, well, we have Bob
Clearmountain mixing our sound.

00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:32.990
So because of the way
that the stage is,

00:21:32.990 --> 00:21:37.410
you have to stand-- you
would have a mic here,

00:21:37.410 --> 00:21:40.090
a mic here, a mic here,
a mic here, and so on,

00:21:40.090 --> 00:21:41.120
so on, so forth.

00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:42.840
And it was a huge setting.

00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:45.780
And Bob Clearmountain was
mixing the sound way out

00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:47.060
in center field.

00:21:47.060 --> 00:21:50.050
So Lionel tells all of
us, who are professionals

00:21:50.050 --> 00:21:53.130
like himself-- we may not
have had as many hit records,

00:21:53.130 --> 00:21:55.680
but we still do the same thing.

00:21:55.680 --> 00:22:00.540
So he says, whatever you do,
don't take the microphone out

00:22:00.540 --> 00:22:03.590
of the stand, because
Bob is queuing

00:22:03.590 --> 00:22:04.870
from where you're standing.

00:22:04.870 --> 00:22:09.310
He'll know he's on mic
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

00:22:09.310 --> 00:22:12.700
So you have to leave your mic
in the stand, and don't move.

00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:15.290
So when it comes up to
your-- when it comes time

00:22:15.290 --> 00:22:18.890
to do your vocal bit, just
stand right in place and go,

00:22:18.890 --> 00:22:21.592
there comes a time-- whatever.

00:22:21.592 --> 00:22:23.516
There's a choice we're making.

00:22:23.516 --> 00:22:25.440
So we play the intro.

00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:27.459
Paul Shaffer's the band leader.

00:22:27.459 --> 00:22:30.742
[HUMMING MELODY]

00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:37.458
Starts with Lionel.

00:22:37.458 --> 00:22:44.936
Pop-- there comes a time
when we all-- ha ha.

00:22:44.936 --> 00:22:45.436
Lionel.

00:22:50.929 --> 00:22:53.424
There's a choice we're making.

00:22:53.424 --> 00:22:57.440
We're saving our-- now,
the next person to come in

00:22:57.440 --> 00:22:59.005
is Harry Belafonte.

00:22:59.005 --> 00:23:02.346
So Harry's at his spot,
but Lionel's already

00:23:02.346 --> 00:23:03.400
moved over here.

00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:07.110
So he turns on the mic
there, no Harry Belafonte.

00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:08.710
So nothing comes.

00:23:08.710 --> 00:23:12.070
Harry Belafonte is singing.

00:23:12.070 --> 00:23:14.159
And so Eric Clapton is
next to me and goes,

00:23:14.159 --> 00:23:15.617
[SIMULATING ELECTRIC
GUITAR SOUNDS.

00:23:18.970 --> 00:23:20.930
And I'm standing
here, just trying

00:23:20.930 --> 00:23:24.460
to play the song diligently
and read the chart.

00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:29.010
So everybody figures
I'm the new kid in town

00:23:29.010 --> 00:23:31.020
even though it's 19-- what-- 85.

00:23:31.020 --> 00:23:36.520
I've been making hit records
for seven years or something,

00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:38.980
but oh, I didn't do big
rock and roll concerts.

00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:43.470
So everybody figures, I'm so
excited, it must be me, right?

00:23:43.470 --> 00:23:44.940
It can't be Eric.

00:23:44.940 --> 00:23:48.870
So if you go on YouTube and
you look at "We Are The World,"

00:23:48.870 --> 00:23:51.280
you'll see all these big
rock stars turn around,

00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:58.930
and look at me, and go--
and I'm going-- of course,

00:23:58.930 --> 00:23:59.950
I don't do that.

00:23:59.950 --> 00:24:01.656
But I'm saying,
it's the superstar.

00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:09.570
But that's the kind
of fun atmosphere

00:24:09.570 --> 00:24:12.740
I like to have at my festival.

00:24:12.740 --> 00:24:18.150
Music, to me, is a
living, breathing thing.

00:24:18.150 --> 00:24:21.760
It's not perfect every night.

00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:23.420
We're still an old-school band.

00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:25.417
We don't have secret
backing tracks running

00:24:25.417 --> 00:24:26.250
and stuff like that.

00:24:26.250 --> 00:24:28.467
And I know, nowadays, most-- oh.

00:24:28.467 --> 00:24:29.550
ANANT SHUKLA: Don't worry.

00:24:29.550 --> 00:24:34.740
NILE RODGERS: See, I told
you things are imperfect.

00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:36.820
Yes.

00:24:36.820 --> 00:24:41.380
But those obstacles and
those variables, that's

00:24:41.380 --> 00:24:43.220
part of performing.

00:24:43.220 --> 00:24:44.820
That's the cool thing.

00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:48.530
It's the energy that goes into
it, the love, the precision.

00:24:48.530 --> 00:24:50.050
We can play.

00:24:50.050 --> 00:24:52.070
It's pretty obvious
we know how to play.

00:24:52.070 --> 00:24:55.390
So every time that we make a
mistake, to us, it's funny.

00:24:55.390 --> 00:24:58.930
And it's just part
of live performing.

00:24:58.930 --> 00:25:04.360
So I've tried to bring that
kind of vibe to the festivals.

00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:08.490
And you'll find that-- or
at least what I've observed

00:25:08.490 --> 00:25:12.390
is that you have less violence.

00:25:12.390 --> 00:25:14.930
It's like magic.

00:25:14.930 --> 00:25:17.620
You have fewer problems.

00:25:17.620 --> 00:25:21.240
People just seem to
become part of your thing.

00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:23.120
We invite people on the stage.

00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:26.330
When we play, we have total
strangers come up on stage.

00:25:26.330 --> 00:25:30.090
And that's why these incidents
that have just happened lately

00:25:30.090 --> 00:25:32.740
really break my
heart, that you could

00:25:32.740 --> 00:25:37.365
have such incredible violence
at music establishments.

00:25:41.270 --> 00:25:43.910
The girl-- I'm sorry,
I don't know her name,

00:25:43.910 --> 00:25:45.070
the artist who was killed.

00:25:45.070 --> 00:25:48.310
And according to what
they said on the news,

00:25:48.310 --> 00:25:50.420
she was reaching out to
a fan with open arms,

00:25:50.420 --> 00:25:51.930
and he just shoots her.

00:25:51.930 --> 00:25:55.720
And then, of course,
the horrible-- and this

00:25:55.720 --> 00:26:01.010
was also in the same
city, at the club Pulse,

00:26:01.010 --> 00:26:05.485
where a guy just goes down
and guns down 50 people.

00:26:10.910 --> 00:26:17.720
In my heart, music has
always been this safe thing.

00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:20.970
I was the one black kid in
this class who didn't fit.

00:26:20.970 --> 00:26:22.370
I was the one so and so.

00:26:22.370 --> 00:26:25.360
But man, put me on
the clarinet, I fit.

00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:28.080
I might be sitting second
chair, but I still fit.

00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:29.760
I'd fit in the orchestra.

00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:32.360
I would fit with
the other musicians.

00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:35.180
I try and run my
sessions the same way.

00:26:35.180 --> 00:26:40.170
I try and make everybody
feel like we're all the same.

00:26:40.170 --> 00:26:42.010
It's just--

00:26:42.010 --> 00:26:44.400
ANANT SHUKLA: You started We
Are Family, the foundation,

00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:46.200
after 9/11 as well,
in the aftermath.

00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:47.700
NILE RODGERS: Boy,
that was a segue.

00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:49.580
Yeah.

00:26:49.580 --> 00:26:51.260
ANANT SHUKLA: That
was similar, right,

00:26:51.260 --> 00:26:53.600
that you were trying to
bring happiness to the world

00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:55.980
and spread that mission,
right, through music?

00:26:55.980 --> 00:26:56.771
NILE RODGERS: Yeah.

00:26:56.771 --> 00:27:00.220
Well, what happened
exactly was--

00:27:00.220 --> 00:27:03.070
so my charity is called the We
Are Family Foundation, based

00:27:03.070 --> 00:27:06.190
after a song I wrote.

00:27:06.190 --> 00:27:08.070
Three of my friends
were in the first plane

00:27:08.070 --> 00:27:13.540
that was crashed into the
North Tower on September 11.

00:27:13.540 --> 00:27:17.010
And it was just
mind boggling, one,

00:27:17.010 --> 00:27:22.090
that anyone could do
something so horrific.

00:27:22.090 --> 00:27:23.710
But the fact that
I had three people

00:27:23.710 --> 00:27:27.750
that I knew on one airplane,
the first airplane, just

00:27:27.750 --> 00:27:30.380
seemed-- what are
the odds of that?

00:27:30.380 --> 00:27:33.470
And it just happened
that I had been in a film

00:27:33.470 --> 00:27:37.940
with Nelson Mandela, and
somebody from South Africa

00:27:37.940 --> 00:27:39.070
was watching that film.

00:27:39.070 --> 00:27:41.400
So they're in a
different time zone.

00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:43.650
So even though this
event was playing out

00:27:43.650 --> 00:27:46.440
early in the morning here,
it was later in the afternoon

00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:47.164
there.

00:27:47.164 --> 00:27:48.080
And they called me up.

00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:51.070
And they said, Nile, you
should redo your song

00:27:51.070 --> 00:27:57.440
"We Are Family" to help
usher in a sense of healing.

00:27:57.440 --> 00:28:01.410
As a composer, that
sounded so weird to me.

00:28:01.410 --> 00:28:05.440
I was like, no, "We Are Family,"
that's just the Sledges song.

00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:06.550
It was about their family.

00:28:06.550 --> 00:28:09.240
And they said, no, but
you don't understand

00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:12.790
that "We Are Family" is played
at bar mitzvahs, and weddings,

00:28:12.790 --> 00:28:15.880
and this, and all these
celebratory events.

00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:18.340
And I reluctantly
went along with it,

00:28:18.340 --> 00:28:22.340
because it just didn't make
sense to me artistically.

00:28:22.340 --> 00:28:25.830
Well, now-- what are we now?

00:28:25.830 --> 00:28:28.440
12 years later,
11 years later, we

00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:32.060
have a wonderful organization
that does incredible work

00:28:32.060 --> 00:28:35.150
all around the world.

00:28:35.150 --> 00:28:42.190
We've affected, I would have
to say, if not billions,

00:28:42.190 --> 00:28:45.920
certainly more than
a billion people.

00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:48.800
And it's probably
one of the best

00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:52.760
parts of my life, my charity.

00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:53.900
Jess is over there.

00:28:57.901 --> 00:29:01.890
She first came to our charity
as a volunteer, I think.

00:29:01.890 --> 00:29:06.321
She was a-- oh no,
you were a mentor.

00:29:06.321 --> 00:29:06.820
Volunteer.

00:29:06.820 --> 00:29:08.340
Volunteer.

00:29:08.340 --> 00:29:10.070
Now she's like the boss.

00:29:10.070 --> 00:29:10.630
Yes, Jess.

00:29:10.630 --> 00:29:11.633
What do I do today?

00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:18.800
Having the We Are
Family Foundation

00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:22.100
has changed my life, the way
that we interact with kids

00:29:22.100 --> 00:29:24.930
all over the world.

00:29:24.930 --> 00:29:31.200
And our programs that we've
generated are unbelievable.

00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:34.540
We have TEDxTeen,
which has become huge.

00:29:34.540 --> 00:29:40.080
We've built schools in, I would
say, at least 17, if not 18,

00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:42.720
countries.

00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:43.600
We've done a lot.

00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:45.659
We've impacted
quite a few people.

00:29:45.659 --> 00:29:46.450
ANANT SHUKLA: Yeah.

00:29:46.450 --> 00:29:48.994
So we're going to open it up
to audience Q&amp;A as well if you

00:29:48.994 --> 00:29:50.118
guys want to start queuing.

00:29:50.118 --> 00:29:51.520
NILE RODGERS: Yea, audience Q&amp;A.

00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:54.030
ANANT SHUKLA: But let's now
talk about The Hitmaker sitting

00:29:54.030 --> 00:29:54.780
right next to you.

00:29:54.780 --> 00:29:55.946
NILE RODGERS: Wait a minute.

00:29:55.946 --> 00:29:58.019
One things that's
really awesome is

00:29:58.019 --> 00:30:01.350
that, right before we started,
a gentleman walked up to me

00:30:01.350 --> 00:30:03.289
and said, wow, I heard--
yeah, it was so cool

00:30:03.289 --> 00:30:04.580
that you worked with Daft Punk.

00:30:04.580 --> 00:30:05.980
And this is a true story.

00:30:05.980 --> 00:30:09.380
You can show yourself
if you're brave enough.

00:30:09.380 --> 00:30:14.620
He walked up to and he says, did
they let you see their faces?

00:30:14.620 --> 00:30:18.830
So as I was getting mic'd,
I said to him, dude,

00:30:18.830 --> 00:30:24.968
you know that was the dumbest
question in the world.

00:30:24.968 --> 00:30:27.785
Like, you think they're
sitting around their studio, oh

00:30:27.785 --> 00:30:31.470
man, it's 150 degrees inside.

00:30:31.470 --> 00:30:33.220
We can be really creative now.

00:30:33.220 --> 00:30:35.420
Phew.

00:30:35.420 --> 00:30:36.940
Anyway, how you doing?

00:30:36.940 --> 00:30:38.756
AUDIENCE: Hey, how you doing?

00:30:38.756 --> 00:30:39.630
My name is Dominique.

00:30:39.630 --> 00:30:41.030
Thanks so much for
being here, and thank

00:30:41.030 --> 00:30:43.810
you so much for creating some
of my favorite music-- you know,

00:30:43.810 --> 00:30:48.310
"We Are Family," "Le Freak,"
and Daft Punk-- this music

00:30:48.310 --> 00:30:51.130
that transports me
to a different time

00:30:51.130 --> 00:30:52.320
and a different place.

00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:53.066
So thank you.

00:30:53.066 --> 00:30:54.440
NILE RODGERS: Oh,
you're welcome.

00:30:54.440 --> 00:30:56.314
AUDIENCE: My question
for you is, how do you,

00:30:56.314 --> 00:31:00.720
as a producer, engender
creativity in the people

00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:02.270
that you work with.

00:31:02.270 --> 00:31:06.500
How do you balance
directing them and just

00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:08.530
getting the creativity
to come out of them?

00:31:08.530 --> 00:31:10.150
What's your approach?

00:31:10.150 --> 00:31:12.240
NILE RODGERS: It's
different based

00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:17.030
on the artist's personality.

00:31:17.030 --> 00:31:19.420
But the one thing
that I try and do

00:31:19.420 --> 00:31:23.390
is make you understand that
I absolutely have your best

00:31:23.390 --> 00:31:28.000
interests at heart, that
I'm very aware of the fact

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:30.010
that, after we
finish the record,

00:31:30.010 --> 00:31:34.930
it's going to say Daft Punk,
produced by Nile Rodgers.

00:31:34.930 --> 00:31:36.660
Your name is going
to be really big,

00:31:36.660 --> 00:31:39.490
and my name is going
to be really small.

00:31:39.490 --> 00:31:42.470
So it's all about the
artist, and I'm just

00:31:42.470 --> 00:31:49.660
trying to help them visualize
and bring to fruition whatever

00:31:49.660 --> 00:31:51.440
artistic ideas they may have.

00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:54.110
And sometimes, if I'm
lucky, we actually

00:31:54.110 --> 00:31:57.667
make them better than what
they thought they could do.

00:31:57.667 --> 00:31:58.500
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:31:58.500 --> 00:32:00.310
NILE RODGERS: You're welcome.

00:32:00.310 --> 00:32:01.210
AUDIENCE: Hi, Nile.

00:32:01.210 --> 00:32:03.660
Thank you so much for making
all this amazing music.

00:32:03.660 --> 00:32:05.990
I have tremendous
respect for your work.

00:32:05.990 --> 00:32:10.860
My question is actually similar
to what our colleague said.

00:32:10.860 --> 00:32:12.939
What was the most
challenging session

00:32:12.939 --> 00:32:13.980
that you've ever been on?

00:32:13.980 --> 00:32:17.760
And how did you make the record
happen at the end of the day?

00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:18.993
Also, Jerry says hi.

00:32:18.993 --> 00:32:20.230
NILE RODGERS: Oh, cool.

00:32:20.230 --> 00:32:20.890
My Jerry?

00:32:20.890 --> 00:32:21.530
AUDIENCE: Jerry Barnes.

00:32:21.530 --> 00:32:22.738
NILE RODGERS: Oh, cool, yeah.

00:32:22.738 --> 00:32:24.384
Oh, great.

00:32:24.384 --> 00:32:25.300
That's my bass player.

00:32:25.300 --> 00:32:27.341
ANANT SHUKLA: And maybe
you can tell us, as well,

00:32:27.341 --> 00:32:30.070
how the song evolved in
a challenging session.

00:32:30.070 --> 00:32:32.690
NILE RODGERS: I'm trying to
think, what do I consider hard?

00:32:35.300 --> 00:32:38.170
Oh, OK.

00:32:38.170 --> 00:32:45.570
The hardest session, when I
think in terms of what it was

00:32:45.570 --> 00:32:49.350
and what it morphed
into, would probably

00:32:49.350 --> 00:32:52.250
be "Let's Dance" by David Bowie.

00:32:52.250 --> 00:32:57.620
And it wasn't because
it was hard technically.

00:32:57.620 --> 00:33:04.970
It was a spiritual and artistic
communications problem that I

00:33:04.970 --> 00:33:07.680
thought existed, but it didn't.

00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:11.560
It's probably easier to
show you than to explain

00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:13.980
some abstract stuff.

00:33:13.980 --> 00:33:16.280
[APPLAUSE]

00:33:16.980 --> 00:33:20.320
So when we were doing
the album "Let's Dance,"

00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:24.404
before David and I had
written one note of music--

00:33:24.404 --> 00:33:31.100
[STRUMMING GUITAR]-- we had gone
all around New York City going

00:33:31.100 --> 00:33:35.940
to different museums and
different places that had huge

00:33:35.940 --> 00:33:40.095
repositories of records, and
rock and roll iconography,

00:33:40.095 --> 00:33:40.970
and things like that.

00:33:40.970 --> 00:33:42.053
We didn't write any music.

00:33:42.053 --> 00:33:44.240
We just wanted to look at stuff.

00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:49.610
So after about a week or two
of looking and listening,

00:33:49.610 --> 00:33:51.580
David came to my apartment.

00:33:51.580 --> 00:33:54.340
And he says-- he had
something behind his back.

00:33:54.340 --> 00:33:57.950
And he wend, Nile,
darling, I want my record

00:33:57.950 --> 00:34:01.360
to sound like this.

00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:02.840
And he basically
wanted the record

00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:05.010
to sound like this picture.

00:34:05.010 --> 00:34:07.620
And the picture
was Little Richard

00:34:07.620 --> 00:34:11.300
in a red suit-- I
happened to wear red pants

00:34:11.300 --> 00:34:13.239
today-- red suit.

00:34:13.239 --> 00:34:16.949
His coif was red, and he was
getting into a red Cadillac

00:34:16.949 --> 00:34:18.120
convertible.

00:34:18.120 --> 00:34:24.850
But I knew that that photo
didn't represent the past,

00:34:24.850 --> 00:34:28.159
even though you can understand--
you could tell what year it was

00:34:28.159 --> 00:34:31.420
by the model of the Cadillac.

00:34:31.420 --> 00:34:34.860
What that photo showed,
it looked like something

00:34:34.860 --> 00:34:36.130
from the future.

00:34:36.130 --> 00:34:37.820
So he was trying to
say that he wanted

00:34:37.820 --> 00:34:41.380
to make a record that would
sound like we just made it

00:34:41.380 --> 00:34:43.395
today no matter
what year it was.

00:34:43.395 --> 00:34:44.270
That's what it meant.

00:34:44.270 --> 00:34:45.850
That's what that
red picture meant.

00:34:45.850 --> 00:34:47.560
And I knew that's what he meant.

00:34:47.560 --> 00:34:53.820
So he walked into my
bedroom about a week later.

00:34:53.820 --> 00:34:57.960
And he says, Nile, darling--
for some reason, Nile,

00:34:57.960 --> 00:35:00.460
the word "Nile"
always was followed

00:35:00.460 --> 00:35:01.460
with the word "darling."

00:35:01.460 --> 00:35:05.417
He went, Nile, darling, I
just wrote this last night,

00:35:05.417 --> 00:35:06.750
and I think this could be a hit.

00:35:06.750 --> 00:35:08.340
It goes something like this.

00:35:08.340 --> 00:35:25.100
[PLAYING GUITAR]

00:35:25.100 --> 00:35:28.820
And I went, uh,
wow, that's weird.

00:35:28.820 --> 00:35:31.450
Because we had just walked
around for two weeks,

00:35:31.450 --> 00:35:34.210
and we had listened to all
this really cool music.

00:35:34.210 --> 00:35:37.420
Everything we listened to was
cutting edge and incredible.

00:35:37.420 --> 00:35:41.670
And to me, this sounded like
a folk song-- not a bad one,

00:35:41.670 --> 00:35:43.915
but just, you know, like na-na.

00:35:43.915 --> 00:35:48.580
And he was singing, let's
dance, da-da, da-da, da-da.

00:35:48.580 --> 00:35:53.407
So I immediately thought that
he was pulling a trick on me.

00:35:53.407 --> 00:35:55.240
I thought he was trying
to see if I was just

00:35:55.240 --> 00:35:58.150
some sycophantish,
wacky dude who

00:35:58.150 --> 00:36:00.010
wanted a paycheck or something.

00:36:00.010 --> 00:36:01.950
So I called one of
his best friends.

00:36:01.950 --> 00:36:04.900
And I said, is David
the kind of person

00:36:04.900 --> 00:36:09.140
who would try and test me and
make me feel like an idiot?

00:36:09.140 --> 00:36:10.300
And he said, no.

00:36:10.300 --> 00:36:11.800
I said, well, he
walked into my room

00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:15.060
today and told me that he
thinks this song is a hit.

00:36:15.060 --> 00:36:16.790
And he said, Nile,
I promise you,

00:36:16.790 --> 00:36:19.170
if David said he
thinks it's a hit,

00:36:19.170 --> 00:36:20.492
he really believes it's a hit.

00:36:20.492 --> 00:36:21.200
And I went, whoa.

00:36:24.410 --> 00:36:28.170
So I said to him, in a moment
of-- I don't know what it was.

00:36:28.170 --> 00:36:29.670
Maybe it was a
moment of brilliance,

00:36:29.670 --> 00:36:31.569
or maybe I was trying
to keep my job.

00:36:31.569 --> 00:36:32.610
I don't know what it was.

00:36:32.610 --> 00:36:37.090
But I just, said, hey David,
can I do an arrangement?

00:36:37.090 --> 00:36:38.630
And he went, sure.

00:36:38.630 --> 00:36:40.060
I was like, whoa, awesome.

00:36:40.060 --> 00:36:41.900
Now we were in Switzerland.

00:36:41.900 --> 00:36:45.410
And the band Queen
owned a recording studio

00:36:45.410 --> 00:36:48.880
in Switzerland, in
Montreux, Switzerland,

00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:50.750
called Mountain Studios.

00:36:50.750 --> 00:36:56.180
So I wrote out some charts, and
we hired some local jazz guys.

00:36:56.180 --> 00:37:01.840
And instead of going
[PLAYING GUITAR],

00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:06.350
I changed my guitar part
to [PLAYING GUITAR],

00:37:06.350 --> 00:37:07.760
which sounded sort of cool.

00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:13.630
But it still sounded a little
folky, because on the guitar,

00:37:13.630 --> 00:37:16.120
on those frets,
you get harmonics.

00:37:16.120 --> 00:37:20.660
So all I did was move it from
[PLAYING GUITAR] just up a half

00:37:20.660 --> 00:37:21.802
step to [PLAYING GUITAR].

00:37:21.802 --> 00:37:25.490
And all of a sudden, I was
like, oh, shit-- oh, Google.

00:37:28.440 --> 00:37:32.051
All of a sudden, it went from
being live to sort of dead.

00:37:32.051 --> 00:37:35.082
[PLAYING GUITAR]

00:37:35.082 --> 00:37:36.540
And I was going,
man, this is cool.

00:37:36.540 --> 00:37:39.823
[PLAYING GUITAR]

00:37:41.230 --> 00:37:44.290
Oh, what I hadn't told
you was that David and I

00:37:44.290 --> 00:37:47.330
had had countless
conversations about jazz,

00:37:47.330 --> 00:37:50.890
and about jazz artists, and all
the jazz people that he liked.

00:37:50.890 --> 00:37:53.420
So I knew that I could
get away with, instead

00:37:53.420 --> 00:37:58.100
of going [PLAYING GUITAR], I
inverted the whole thing up

00:37:58.100 --> 00:37:58.720
an octave.

00:37:58.720 --> 00:38:00.940
I went [PLAYING GUITAR].

00:38:00.940 --> 00:38:05.790
And then I put in a B
flat minor 13 chord,

00:38:05.790 --> 00:38:08.740
which I knew he would love,
because he likes jazz.

00:38:08.740 --> 00:38:10.250
He would just think
that was cool.

00:38:10.250 --> 00:38:16.290
So I went [PLAYING GUITAR]

00:38:16.290 --> 00:38:19.450
And he was like,
wow, that's my song?

00:38:19.450 --> 00:38:21.370
I went, yeah, now
check this out.

00:38:21.370 --> 00:38:25.742
[PLAYING GUITAR]

00:38:25.742 --> 00:38:27.580
So then I just started
jamming and started

00:38:27.580 --> 00:39:04.460
going [PLAYING GUITAR]

00:39:04.460 --> 00:39:07.500
[APPLAUSE]

00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:10.624
And so after, I
said, well, I think

00:39:10.624 --> 00:39:12.040
these should be
the chord changes.

00:39:12.040 --> 00:39:13.530
Let's make this the progression.

00:39:13.530 --> 00:39:14.970
He said, ah, I love it.

00:39:14.970 --> 00:39:15.710
And I said, cool.

00:39:15.710 --> 00:39:16.770
We ran to the studio.

00:39:16.770 --> 00:39:18.360
I had all the
charts written out.

00:39:18.360 --> 00:39:20.700
So that was just the
audition session just

00:39:20.700 --> 00:39:25.040
to see if he would say,
I hate it or love it.

00:39:25.040 --> 00:39:29.090
Then I gave all the music
to the band, to the players.

00:39:29.090 --> 00:39:30.450
We didn't know any of the guys.

00:39:30.450 --> 00:39:34.400
They were just
local studio guys.

00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:39.876
And it was very much like
"Let's Dance" that you know.

00:39:39.876 --> 00:39:44.300
And I remember asking
him, David, do you

00:39:44.300 --> 00:39:46.450
think I made this too funky?

00:39:46.450 --> 00:39:51.550
And he said the coolest thing
I have ever heard in my life.

00:39:51.550 --> 00:39:53.400
I cherish these words.

00:39:53.400 --> 00:39:55.080
I cherish this artist.

00:39:55.080 --> 00:39:57.390
He's wonderful.

00:39:57.390 --> 00:40:04.160
He looked at me and went, Nile,
darling, is there such a thing?

00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:08.090
I was like, you are the man.

00:40:08.090 --> 00:40:08.880
I get it.

00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:12.530
If we can ever reach that
point of being too funky,

00:40:12.530 --> 00:40:14.170
we go to Nirvana or something.

00:40:14.170 --> 00:40:16.750
It was like, is
there such a thing?

00:40:16.750 --> 00:40:18.300
Can you make a song too funky?

00:40:18.300 --> 00:40:21.300
Could you ever achieve that?

00:40:21.300 --> 00:40:24.630
So I obviously didn't
make it too funky.

00:40:24.630 --> 00:40:27.250
The arrangement that
I wrote out is exactly

00:40:27.250 --> 00:40:29.500
the arrangement we wound up
playing back in New York.

00:40:29.500 --> 00:40:32.790
Didn't change anything.

00:40:32.790 --> 00:40:34.700
And that's the
record we put out.

00:40:34.700 --> 00:40:39.250
Someone, earlier, asked me if
there's ever any pressure on me

00:40:39.250 --> 00:40:42.630
to put out the outtakes
of "Let's Dance."

00:40:42.630 --> 00:40:45.640
I said, there is no
outtakes of "Let's Dance."

00:40:45.640 --> 00:40:46.350
We played it.

00:40:46.350 --> 00:40:47.540
We got it right.

00:40:47.540 --> 00:40:48.460
That's "Let's Dance."

00:40:48.460 --> 00:40:49.750
There is no other version.

00:40:49.750 --> 00:40:52.134
That's the only one that exists.

00:40:52.134 --> 00:40:53.550
AUDIENCE: So I
have two questions.

00:40:53.550 --> 00:40:55.840
The first one-- you talk
a bit about arrangement.

00:40:55.840 --> 00:40:59.880
I'm always a believer
in, Da Vinci's art

00:40:59.880 --> 00:41:02.590
is only ever abandoned,
never finished.

00:41:02.590 --> 00:41:05.300
So I wanted to ask you,
firstly, how you know when

00:41:05.300 --> 00:41:07.060
you've finished an arrangement.

00:41:07.060 --> 00:41:10.790
And secondly, you take a
very progressive approach

00:41:10.790 --> 00:41:14.180
to collaborating and working
with other artists, obviously,

00:41:14.180 --> 00:41:16.505
anyone from Biggie to
your recent collaboration

00:41:16.505 --> 00:41:17.810
with the Martinez brothers.

00:41:17.810 --> 00:41:20.690
I'm kind of curious
whether you've

00:41:20.690 --> 00:41:25.820
thought about alternative
licensing routes

00:41:25.820 --> 00:41:31.180
that you might take such that
once you are no longer with us,

00:41:31.180 --> 00:41:35.500
people continue to make Nile
Rodgers music with your samples

00:41:35.500 --> 00:41:39.500
and your estate
enables that to happen.

00:41:39.500 --> 00:41:40.890
NILE RODGERS: You are so cool.

00:41:40.890 --> 00:41:44.960
Because that's-- I'm
not waiting to die.

00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:48.980
I'm already--
that's what I think

00:41:48.980 --> 00:41:51.060
the world is going towards.

00:41:51.060 --> 00:41:56.065
That's what I think the music
business is going to become.

00:41:59.674 --> 00:42:05.550
The old model of composition
will still remain somewhat,

00:42:05.550 --> 00:42:08.000
but I think that the newer
model, especially when I

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:10.295
work with a lot of
artists-- I go in there,

00:42:10.295 --> 00:42:12.170
and they say hey, Nile,
listen to this track.

00:42:12.170 --> 00:42:16.040
And I listen, and I go, um,
I'm playing guitar on there.

00:42:16.040 --> 00:42:17.160
I just met you.

00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:17.860
Oh yeah, right.

00:42:17.860 --> 00:42:19.660
Well, we pulled that
from the outtake.

00:42:19.660 --> 00:42:22.300
We found one of your tapes,
and it had this thing on there.

00:42:22.300 --> 00:42:26.460
So yeah, I think that we're in
a sort of cut and paste world

00:42:26.460 --> 00:42:30.100
where we can take an
idea from someplace,

00:42:30.100 --> 00:42:37.090
and we can actually, digitally,
take the full bandwidth sample.

00:42:37.090 --> 00:42:41.800
So I recently did a thing
for the film "Trolls."

00:42:41.800 --> 00:42:46.590
And I recreated
something exactly,

00:42:46.590 --> 00:42:49.990
not because they
couldn't do it, but just

00:42:49.990 --> 00:42:52.590
so I wanted to give them
the advantage of being

00:42:52.590 --> 00:42:56.200
able to do a whole full
bandwidth representation

00:42:56.200 --> 00:42:57.700
of the music if they wanted to.

00:42:57.700 --> 00:42:58.875
If they didn't want
to, you could just

00:42:58.875 --> 00:43:00.000
go back and get the sample.

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:03.560
And speaking of Biggie, it's
the song we did with Biggie.

00:43:03.560 --> 00:43:06.220
And you can go get that
sample and just do that.

00:43:06.220 --> 00:43:11.480
But the fact that it
came up in that film,

00:43:11.480 --> 00:43:13.830
and I just did this two
weeks ago, and the fact

00:43:13.830 --> 00:43:17.970
that you brought it up today--
although you were thinking I

00:43:17.970 --> 00:43:21.809
was thinking like
that, after I die--

00:43:21.809 --> 00:43:23.350
it's the way that
the world is going.

00:43:23.350 --> 00:43:24.920
That's composition.

00:43:24.920 --> 00:43:26.380
That's what's going to happen.

00:43:26.380 --> 00:43:28.730
We're going to
actually not only take

00:43:28.730 --> 00:43:31.720
the original motifs, but
even the original recordings.

00:43:31.720 --> 00:43:35.020
And we'll redesign them,
and reorchestrate them,

00:43:35.020 --> 00:43:37.310
and rework work.

00:43:37.310 --> 00:43:40.130
They'll become very malleable.

00:43:40.130 --> 00:43:43.860
I just finished a record with
Elton John and Janelle Monae

00:43:43.860 --> 00:43:46.580
that I composed in 4/4.

00:43:46.580 --> 00:43:48.690
The final version
of it is in 6/8,

00:43:48.690 --> 00:43:51.280
and they never had
to re-sing it again.

00:43:51.280 --> 00:43:55.550
I painstakingly took two
weeks to make this thing move

00:43:55.550 --> 00:43:59.490
note by note by note, and
it sounds letter-perfect.

00:43:59.490 --> 00:44:01.140
And when you hear
the next Chic album,

00:44:01.140 --> 00:44:03.790
if you happen to
listen to it, listen

00:44:03.790 --> 00:44:06.390
to the song that's
in 6/8 and remember

00:44:06.390 --> 00:44:07.470
that I cut that in 4/4.

00:44:11.130 --> 00:44:13.720
AUDIENCE: It is such
an honor to meet you.

00:44:13.720 --> 00:44:15.450
My name is Sanjay.

00:44:15.450 --> 00:44:17.990
I used to be a session
pianist in Hollywood,

00:44:17.990 --> 00:44:20.260
and I was very poor,
and I got tired.

00:44:20.260 --> 00:44:23.960
And I eventually came here.

00:44:23.960 --> 00:44:27.692
NILE RODGERS: Wow,
a real step up.

00:44:27.692 --> 00:44:30.450
AUDIENCE: And that's my point.

00:44:30.450 --> 00:44:32.690
I wasn't valued as a musician.

00:44:32.690 --> 00:44:35.930
I was not-- all my friends
who were session players

00:44:35.930 --> 00:44:38.690
couldn't find work, because
music is being produced

00:44:38.690 --> 00:44:43.100
by a single producer, a
DJ, on Pro Tools or Ableton

00:44:43.100 --> 00:44:45.040
on their laptop at home.

00:44:45.040 --> 00:44:47.690
And so there's this idea
in Hollywood right now,

00:44:47.690 --> 00:44:50.592
and the like
instrumentalists feel

00:44:50.592 --> 00:44:52.550
like they're no longer
important and they don't

00:44:52.550 --> 00:44:54.480
have a place in music anymore.

00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:57.030
I was curious-- I think there
is for certain artists, right?

00:44:57.030 --> 00:44:59.380
If you're going to tour
with Beyonce, great.

00:44:59.380 --> 00:45:03.500
But that's not even
1% of artists, right?

00:45:03.500 --> 00:45:05.990
So it's just very difficult,
devoting your whole life

00:45:05.990 --> 00:45:08.820
to getting really, really good
at violin, to then never get

00:45:08.820 --> 00:45:10.360
sessions or never get work.

00:45:10.360 --> 00:45:12.320
I was just curious
what your thoughts are

00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:14.930
on this digital music
ecosystem that's

00:45:14.930 --> 00:45:17.840
being built out and
distributed and the importance

00:45:17.840 --> 00:45:20.590
of live recordings
and how you feel

00:45:20.590 --> 00:45:23.340
about what's going on from
the recording standpoint.

00:45:23.340 --> 00:45:27.660
NILE RODGERS: So I understand
where you're coming from,

00:45:27.660 --> 00:45:29.020
because that is real.

00:45:29.020 --> 00:45:30.550
That's absolutely real.

00:45:30.550 --> 00:45:36.150
But I think that, somehow,
the world writes itself,

00:45:36.150 --> 00:45:39.350
and we'll go to a new
reality, sort of like what

00:45:39.350 --> 00:45:41.310
the gentleman just mentioned.

00:45:41.310 --> 00:45:47.700
We'll go to a new reality
where-- first of all, musicians

00:45:47.700 --> 00:45:50.545
have traditionally
always been poor, bro.

00:45:50.545 --> 00:45:51.420
AUDIENCE: Oh, I know.

00:45:51.420 --> 00:45:52.240
I know.

00:45:52.240 --> 00:45:54.460
NILE RODGERS: It's
only a handful of lucky

00:45:54.460 --> 00:46:00.740
few that-- when you decide to
become a musician, you say,

00:46:00.740 --> 00:46:04.420
I have now committed
myself to being poor.

00:46:04.420 --> 00:46:08.100
So if you go into
music thinking that,

00:46:08.100 --> 00:46:11.050
I'm going to make a fortune,
that's the wrong motivation.

00:46:11.050 --> 00:46:12.530
That's just wacky.

00:46:12.530 --> 00:46:13.830
It makes no sense.

00:46:13.830 --> 00:46:17.160
But if you're lucky enough
to make a living at it,

00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:19.120
and you can gig, and
you can do a church,

00:46:19.120 --> 00:46:24.740
or you can work with Beyonce,
or whatever, that's amazing.

00:46:24.740 --> 00:46:27.600
But I think that
music is so vital

00:46:27.600 --> 00:46:35.630
that as many platforms
that exist now, all of them

00:46:35.630 --> 00:46:36.840
suck up music.

00:46:36.840 --> 00:46:39.100
It's almost like a black hole.

00:46:39.100 --> 00:46:42.660
There's a need for more, and
more, and more, and more music

00:46:42.660 --> 00:46:44.140
for some reason.

00:46:44.140 --> 00:46:47.810
Actually, another song never
actually has to be composed

00:46:47.810 --> 00:46:49.270
and we'd have plenty of music.

00:46:49.270 --> 00:46:50.790
But that's just how it is.

00:46:50.790 --> 00:46:52.640
People want something
new or something

00:46:52.640 --> 00:46:55.080
that appears to be new.

00:46:55.080 --> 00:47:03.190
So there's going to be a way
that great violinists will

00:47:03.190 --> 00:47:04.790
have something to offer.

00:47:04.790 --> 00:47:07.920
I believe, learn
your instruments.

00:47:07.920 --> 00:47:09.900
Learn them well.

00:47:09.900 --> 00:47:12.224
And if anything, you wind
up just having a good time.

00:47:12.224 --> 00:47:14.140
There's nothing wrong
with having a good time.

00:47:14.140 --> 00:47:15.681
I know you're at
Google and everybody

00:47:15.681 --> 00:47:17.460
wants to be gazillionaires
and all that,

00:47:17.460 --> 00:47:19.240
but it's also fun to have fun.

00:47:22.430 --> 00:47:26.070
This was going to
be a hobby, sort of,

00:47:26.070 --> 00:47:28.650
but it was a hobby that I
turned into a profession.

00:47:28.650 --> 00:47:30.830
I actually like doing it.

00:47:30.830 --> 00:47:34.060
I have more fun
playing music free

00:47:34.060 --> 00:47:36.580
than I do the music
I get paid for.

00:47:36.580 --> 00:47:38.750
Because the music
that I get paid for,

00:47:38.750 --> 00:47:42.260
there has to be a result,
whereas when I'm just home

00:47:42.260 --> 00:47:44.960
jamming, I'm having a blast.

00:47:44.960 --> 00:47:47.120
No one's criticizing
me, and I don't

00:47:47.120 --> 00:47:50.290
have to turn it in by Friday.

00:47:50.290 --> 00:47:54.407
I can tell LA Reid, yo
man, she didn't show up.

00:47:54.407 --> 00:47:55.990
ANANT SHUKLA: In the
interest of time,

00:47:55.990 --> 00:47:57.140
we're going to do a few
quickfire questions.

00:47:57.140 --> 00:47:57.848
NILE RODGERS: OK.

00:47:57.848 --> 00:47:58.797
Sorry.

00:47:58.797 --> 00:48:00.880
AUDIENCE: For how long
you've been in the business

00:48:00.880 --> 00:48:02.990
and worked with so many
different artists, and someone

00:48:02.990 --> 00:48:05.031
like David Bowie, where
you worked with him twice

00:48:05.031 --> 00:48:06.849
at different points
in his career--

00:48:06.849 --> 00:48:07.890
NILE RODGERS: Four times.

00:48:07.890 --> 00:48:08.765
AUDIENCE: Four times?

00:48:08.765 --> 00:48:09.860
NILE RODGERS: Yeah.

00:48:09.860 --> 00:48:11.430
Why'd you only think twice?

00:48:11.430 --> 00:48:13.114
AUDIENCE: I thought
I said twice.

00:48:13.114 --> 00:48:15.405
NILE RODGERS: No, I said,
why did you only think twice.

00:48:15.405 --> 00:48:16.340
AUDIENCE: Oh, because
I thought it was "Let's

00:48:16.340 --> 00:48:17.890
Dance" and "Black
Tie White Noise."

00:48:17.890 --> 00:48:18.555
NILE RODGERS: Those are albums.

00:48:18.555 --> 00:48:18.930
AUDIENCE: Oh.

00:48:18.930 --> 00:48:21.260
NILE RODGERS: But then I
did "Dancing In The Street"

00:48:21.260 --> 00:48:24.140
for Live Aid, him
with Mick Jagger.

00:48:24.140 --> 00:48:28.510
And then I did a film for
Bakshi called "Cool World."

00:48:28.510 --> 00:48:30.140
AUDIENCE: Oh, then
that was my mistake.

00:48:30.140 --> 00:48:30.465
I apologize.

00:48:30.465 --> 00:48:31.570
NILE RODGERS: That's OK.

00:48:31.570 --> 00:48:32.640
AUDIENCE: As a
Bowie fan, I should

00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:33.681
be embarrassed right now.

00:48:33.681 --> 00:48:37.589
NILE RODGERS: It's not that
I really-- I'm like-- no.

00:48:37.589 --> 00:48:38.505
AUDIENCE: I apologize.

00:48:38.505 --> 00:48:39.415
NILE RODGERS: No, no, it's cool.

00:48:39.415 --> 00:48:41.123
AUDIENCE: Anywho, my
question being that,

00:48:41.123 --> 00:48:43.260
working with an artist
over this amount of time

00:48:43.260 --> 00:48:47.400
and so many artists to now,
how has the technology changed

00:48:47.400 --> 00:48:48.870
your approach as a producer?

00:48:48.870 --> 00:48:50.530
And how do you find
it different in how

00:48:50.530 --> 00:48:52.620
to communicate with
artists, such as,

00:48:52.620 --> 00:48:55.190
is there a different
expectation of you as a producer

00:48:55.190 --> 00:48:57.497
as there was 10 years
ago, 20 years ago?

00:48:57.497 --> 00:48:59.080
And how does that
affect how you work?

00:48:59.080 --> 00:49:01.570
NILE RODGERS: So
it's interesting,

00:49:01.570 --> 00:49:06.590
the final outcome
expectation is the same.

00:49:06.590 --> 00:49:07.860
They want a hit.

00:49:07.860 --> 00:49:09.450
I got that part.

00:49:09.450 --> 00:49:13.500
But because of the
technology-- like,

00:49:13.500 --> 00:49:17.930
I just did a record
with Laura Mvula.

00:49:17.930 --> 00:49:24.310
And she could see
me on the computer

00:49:24.310 --> 00:49:25.330
while I was playing it.

00:49:25.330 --> 00:49:28.650
And I could do this inversion,
and do that, and change it.

00:49:28.650 --> 00:49:31.220
So it felt like she
was in the room.

00:49:31.220 --> 00:49:33.760
As a matter of fact, we
just had-- at our last

00:49:33.760 --> 00:49:38.160
We Are Family event, we
had-- a robot version of one

00:49:38.160 --> 00:49:44.390
of our spiritual leaders, if you
will, walking around the room,

00:49:44.390 --> 00:49:45.950
interacting with the kids.

00:49:45.950 --> 00:49:50.640
So we now can have a physical
presence in the studio

00:49:50.640 --> 00:49:52.800
even though I'm on a
different continent.

00:49:52.800 --> 00:49:56.610
So I feel very
comfortable working

00:49:56.610 --> 00:50:00.350
while the person is looking
over my shoulder on Skype.

00:50:00.350 --> 00:50:02.990
Or if there's a robot in
the room looking down at me

00:50:02.990 --> 00:50:05.520
and saying, hey Nile, what
if you played it there,

00:50:05.520 --> 00:50:07.460
it feels very natural to me.

00:50:07.460 --> 00:50:09.740
And I think that over
the next few years,

00:50:09.740 --> 00:50:12.030
it's going to feel
even more organic.

00:50:12.030 --> 00:50:20.359
That sense of a few milliseconds
away will just feel normal.

00:50:20.359 --> 00:50:21.650
Does that answer your question?

00:50:21.650 --> 00:50:24.362
AUDIENCE: I was more so
with about the technology

00:50:24.362 --> 00:50:26.070
as far as recording
and things like that,

00:50:26.070 --> 00:50:28.300
and how the artists
maybe view what

00:50:28.300 --> 00:50:29.840
your position as a producer is.

00:50:29.840 --> 00:50:34.800
NILE RODGERS: Well,
I think the artists

00:50:34.800 --> 00:50:36.870
look at it in a similar way.

00:50:36.870 --> 00:50:39.510
You gotta remember, artists
are not just the same.

00:50:39.510 --> 00:50:42.190
I mean, there's a big difference
between Bowie and Madonna,

00:50:42.190 --> 00:50:43.660
or the B-52s.

00:50:43.660 --> 00:50:46.140
We're all different people,
and we all see the world

00:50:46.140 --> 00:50:47.355
through our own lens.

00:50:50.260 --> 00:50:55.000
But it feels-- to me,
it feels the same.

00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:58.080
I just finished working
with people that

00:50:58.080 --> 00:51:00.760
are 18 years old, 19 years old.

00:51:00.760 --> 00:51:07.010
And it didn't feel any
different than working

00:51:07.010 --> 00:51:09.670
with Lady Gaga or anyone else.

00:51:09.670 --> 00:51:12.630
It was the same.

00:51:12.630 --> 00:51:16.080
I just become smarter
about more gear.

00:51:16.080 --> 00:51:17.060
There's just more gear.

00:51:17.060 --> 00:51:19.440
Of course, I just
want gear anyway.

00:51:19.440 --> 00:51:20.246
It's like clothes.

00:51:20.246 --> 00:51:21.370
You just want more clothes.

00:51:21.370 --> 00:51:22.360
You want more gear.

00:51:22.360 --> 00:51:24.510
Just give me stuff
to fool-- like,

00:51:24.510 --> 00:51:26.510
what does this
button do, you know?

00:51:30.370 --> 00:51:34.240
The thing is that, with all
the technology that we build,

00:51:34.240 --> 00:51:35.370
what are we trying to do?

00:51:35.370 --> 00:51:38.120
All we're trying to do
is emulate the world

00:51:38.120 --> 00:51:39.460
that we've come from.

00:51:39.460 --> 00:51:41.460
Everything that
we build, we make

00:51:41.460 --> 00:51:44.232
it to simulate the thing
that was in the room.

00:51:44.232 --> 00:51:45.690
And that was the
thing that we were

00:51:45.690 --> 00:51:47.314
trying to get around,
because it didn't

00:51:47.314 --> 00:51:49.010
work as well as it should.

00:51:49.010 --> 00:51:51.700
So it's a funny
paradox, right, where

00:51:51.700 --> 00:51:55.310
we're making gear that's
sort of old-fashioned,

00:51:55.310 --> 00:51:57.620
this really high-tech gear
to sound old-fashioned.

00:51:57.620 --> 00:51:59.036
And it was the
old-fashioned stuff

00:51:59.036 --> 00:52:00.590
that we had to figure
out, shit, what

00:52:00.590 --> 00:52:02.440
do we do to make
this thing do that?

00:52:02.440 --> 00:52:05.935
Because it, in and of
itself, can only do this.

00:52:05.935 --> 00:52:08.060
AUDIENCE: Thank you, that
explains it a bit better.

00:52:08.060 --> 00:52:08.559
Thank you.

00:52:11.400 --> 00:52:14.280
AUDIENCE: Hi, it's a true
honor to see you here.

00:52:14.280 --> 00:52:16.689
I'm a big fan, especially of
your work with Duran Duran.

00:52:16.689 --> 00:52:17.980
I'm a huge fan of Duran Duran--

00:52:17.980 --> 00:52:18.310
NILE RODGERS: Oh, thank you.

00:52:18.310 --> 00:52:20.560
AUDIENCE: --so I love that
you keep working with them.

00:52:20.560 --> 00:52:22.250
I wanted to ask
about your guitar.

00:52:22.250 --> 00:52:24.430
You've talked, in your
blog, about how you almost

00:52:24.430 --> 00:52:25.670
lost it on a train.

00:52:25.670 --> 00:52:28.330
You had to run, and
go to the police,

00:52:28.330 --> 00:52:30.890
and go to the dispatch
and everything.

00:52:30.890 --> 00:52:31.990
You finally found it.

00:52:31.990 --> 00:52:33.490
And you're trying
to make a replica.

00:52:33.490 --> 00:52:34.395
Is that correct?

00:52:34.395 --> 00:52:34.820
NILE RODGERS: Done.

00:52:34.820 --> 00:52:36.940
AUDIENCE: So what makes
the Hitmaker so special?

00:52:36.940 --> 00:52:38.982
How did you guys come together?

00:52:38.982 --> 00:52:39.690
NILE RODGERS: OK.

00:52:39.690 --> 00:52:43.330
So what makes this
one special to me

00:52:43.330 --> 00:52:47.270
is because I traded a really
big jazz guitar for it

00:52:47.270 --> 00:52:49.440
and got $300 back and this.

00:52:49.440 --> 00:52:51.670
It was like, whoa,
are you kidding me?

00:52:51.670 --> 00:52:53.620
I get $300 too?

00:52:53.620 --> 00:52:56.560
I didn't know anything
about solid body guitars

00:52:56.560 --> 00:52:57.780
when I bought this.

00:52:57.780 --> 00:53:00.330
I was a jazz guy
and a classical guy.

00:53:00.330 --> 00:53:03.400
So I didn't know that
this would have been

00:53:03.400 --> 00:53:05.179
considered a factory second.

00:53:05.179 --> 00:53:07.220
In today's world, they
would've have passed this.

00:53:07.220 --> 00:53:08.928
This wouldn't have
passed the inspection.

00:53:08.928 --> 00:53:13.690
But in the year that
it was built, in 1959,

00:53:13.690 --> 00:53:18.970
Leo Fender, the guy who
invented this company,

00:53:18.970 --> 00:53:22.630
was so cheap that if he saw
a screw on the floor-- this

00:53:22.630 --> 00:53:24.680
is a true story--
if he saw a screw,

00:53:24.680 --> 00:53:27.240
he would pick up that
screw and look around

00:53:27.240 --> 00:53:30.500
for something in the
room to put the screw in.

00:53:30.500 --> 00:53:31.500
That's how cheap he was.

00:53:31.500 --> 00:53:34.590
So there was no way he
was letting this imperfect

00:53:34.590 --> 00:53:37.200
guitar not be sold.

00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:39.680
So I bought it at
some cheap little pawn

00:53:39.680 --> 00:53:42.190
shop in Miami Beach.

00:53:42.190 --> 00:53:48.620
And it was-- it doesn't
meet factory specs

00:53:48.620 --> 00:53:50.450
or anything like that.

00:53:50.450 --> 00:53:52.550
And it has what they
call a hard tail.

00:53:52.550 --> 00:53:55.560
That's because it's so thin that
you couldn't put a whammy bar

00:53:55.560 --> 00:53:57.930
mechanism inside of it, so
you just put the strings

00:53:57.930 --> 00:53:58.940
through the body.

00:53:58.940 --> 00:54:03.330
So my guitar is lighter than
any Strat you've ever played.

00:54:03.330 --> 00:54:05.780
It weighs nothing.

00:54:05.780 --> 00:54:09.050
It was bought--
the wood that they

00:54:09.050 --> 00:54:13.340
used to make it was
not grown at sea level.

00:54:13.340 --> 00:54:15.890
Fender thought he
was getting a deal.

00:54:15.890 --> 00:54:18.010
So he bought the wood.

00:54:18.010 --> 00:54:21.160
And it wasn't going to be
the price as delivered.

00:54:21.160 --> 00:54:23.230
It was the price, but
they had to go pick it up.

00:54:23.230 --> 00:54:26.060
And when they got to the farm
where the wood was growing,

00:54:26.060 --> 00:54:28.370
it was up on a mountain.

00:54:28.370 --> 00:54:30.410
So when they got the wood
back from the factory,

00:54:30.410 --> 00:54:34.130
it was dry enough to use right
away, whereas normally, they

00:54:34.130 --> 00:54:36.694
would have the wood sit around
for, I don't know how long.

00:54:36.694 --> 00:54:37.860
But they used it right away.

00:54:37.860 --> 00:54:40.280
So this guitar was made.

00:54:40.280 --> 00:54:43.870
And then they probably tried to
stretch the allotment of wood.

00:54:43.870 --> 00:54:47.640
So everything that went
into making this thing wrong

00:54:47.640 --> 00:54:51.120
makes it so right that,
when I got it, to me,

00:54:51.120 --> 00:54:53.520
this is what a Fender
Strat sounded like.

00:54:53.520 --> 00:54:58.260
So I then started playing
everything with this,

00:54:58.260 --> 00:55:00.450
because it sounded unique to me.

00:55:00.450 --> 00:55:03.470
And I thought all Fender Strats
sounded like this until I

00:55:03.470 --> 00:55:05.440
went and bought my next one.

00:55:05.440 --> 00:55:08.980
Oh man, it was like--
nothing sounds like this.

00:55:08.980 --> 00:55:10.850
So yes, we have recreated it.

00:55:10.850 --> 00:55:13.060
It took us almost 20 years.

00:55:13.060 --> 00:55:15.250
We had to really take it apart.

00:55:15.250 --> 00:55:19.740
We had to consider the density
of the wood, the moisture

00:55:19.740 --> 00:55:24.090
content, the electronics,
which are totally just

00:55:24.090 --> 00:55:26.300
regular Fender, nothing fancy.

00:55:26.300 --> 00:55:28.710
The only thing that
seems like it's fancy

00:55:28.710 --> 00:55:30.680
are these Gibson speed knobs.

00:55:30.680 --> 00:55:32.770
Because back in the
day there were songs

00:55:32.770 --> 00:55:38.020
that we used to play
like [PLAYING GUITAR]

00:55:38.020 --> 00:55:41.262
And there was no dirt in my pot.

00:55:41.262 --> 00:55:44.699
[PLAYING GUITAR]

00:55:45.690 --> 00:55:47.060
Now we use a peddle to do it.

00:55:47.060 --> 00:55:49.570
But it was cooler to be
in a nice, smoky club

00:55:49.570 --> 00:55:52.982
and just go [PLAYING GUITAR]

00:55:52.982 --> 00:55:54.950
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:54.950 --> 00:55:56.640
So that's why they're on there.

00:55:56.640 --> 00:56:04.090
And this I put on because I
just thought it looked cool.

00:56:04.090 --> 00:56:06.070
No reason other than that.

00:56:06.070 --> 00:56:08.240
It doesn't help with the
shielding or anything,

00:56:08.240 --> 00:56:09.734
it just looked cool.

00:56:09.734 --> 00:56:10.900
AUDIENCE: Thank you so much.

00:56:10.900 --> 00:56:12.550
ANANT SHUKLA: So can we
take both of your questions

00:56:12.550 --> 00:56:14.230
together, just because
we have to run out?

00:56:14.230 --> 00:56:14.740
NILE RODGERS: We're out of time?

00:56:14.740 --> 00:56:15.550
Ooh, so sorry.

00:56:15.550 --> 00:56:18.102
AUDIENCE: We'll speak
at the same time,

00:56:18.102 --> 00:56:20.680
or you can combine these
question into one answer.

00:56:20.680 --> 00:56:23.034
Like many Googlers here,
I'm involved in music.

00:56:23.034 --> 00:56:24.700
And I think I understand
pretty well how

00:56:24.700 --> 00:56:25.995
to make notes work together.

00:56:25.995 --> 00:56:27.290
I'm a nerdy person.

00:56:27.290 --> 00:56:28.910
I understand notes pretty well.

00:56:28.910 --> 00:56:30.326
What I don't get
at all is how you

00:56:30.326 --> 00:56:32.560
know when a song's going
to be a hit, how you take

00:56:32.560 --> 00:56:35.169
an idea of a song and think,
wait, somewhere in there,

00:56:35.169 --> 00:56:36.710
that's the hit sound
people are going

00:56:36.710 --> 00:56:38.280
to like all over the world.

00:56:38.280 --> 00:56:40.110
How do you do that?

00:56:40.110 --> 00:56:41.133
And--

00:56:41.133 --> 00:56:46.020
AUDIENCE: And my question is,
throughout your career, all

00:56:46.020 --> 00:56:48.760
the music that you've
heard, what bleeds in

00:56:48.760 --> 00:56:52.680
and what bleeds out of
you to make your sound?

00:56:52.680 --> 00:56:55.640
NILE RODGERS: Wow, I don't--
I think I understand that.

00:56:55.640 --> 00:56:58.800
The first one I
totally understand.

00:56:58.800 --> 00:57:03.100
And the answer to
that is, I don't know.

00:57:03.100 --> 00:57:05.120
You play the music.

00:57:05.120 --> 00:57:06.230
You compose the music.

00:57:06.230 --> 00:57:08.630
You perform it.

00:57:08.630 --> 00:57:11.410
And if it makes you
really feel good,

00:57:11.410 --> 00:57:14.610
then you hope that it makes
other people feel good too.

00:57:14.610 --> 00:57:16.780
I don't know it.

00:57:16.780 --> 00:57:20.490
I think the only two or
three times in my life--

00:57:20.490 --> 00:57:23.210
and I've had hundreds--
hundreds, and hundreds,

00:57:23.210 --> 00:57:27.080
and hundreds-- of
singles-- the only time

00:57:27.080 --> 00:57:32.170
that I knew for a fact a song
was a hit was "We Are Family."

00:57:32.170 --> 00:57:35.000
I knew it was a hit,
absolutely knew it,

00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:38.970
because the guitar
part was smokin'.

00:57:38.970 --> 00:57:42.466
"Le Freak," maybe because
the guitar part was smokin'.

00:57:46.090 --> 00:57:50.760
And what other song?

00:57:50.760 --> 00:57:52.470
Diana Ross.

00:57:52.470 --> 00:57:56.220
I knew "I'm Coming
Out" was a hit

00:57:56.220 --> 00:57:58.630
even though we put out
"Upside Down" first.

00:57:58.630 --> 00:58:03.100
And in both cases
with Diana Ross,

00:58:03.100 --> 00:58:05.470
putting "Upside
Down" out first, we

00:58:05.470 --> 00:58:09.710
did that because we knew that
"I'm Coming Out" was a smash.

00:58:09.710 --> 00:58:12.080
So we wanted to get that
one hit under our belt

00:58:12.080 --> 00:58:14.320
and then come with
the smash after that.

00:58:14.320 --> 00:58:18.360
Same thing with "We Are Family."

00:58:18.360 --> 00:58:21.600
We knew that "We Are
Family" was so good that we

00:58:21.600 --> 00:58:24.140
had another record on there
that was a smash called

00:58:24.140 --> 00:58:25.920
"He's The Greatest Dancer."

00:58:25.920 --> 00:58:28.950
People don't realize, "He's The
Greatest Dancer" was a platinum

00:58:28.950 --> 00:58:30.960
single out of the box.

00:58:30.960 --> 00:58:34.580
But "We Are Family" was so big
that people forget that "He's

00:58:34.580 --> 00:58:36.620
The Greatest
Dancer"-- they forget

00:58:36.620 --> 00:58:39.250
that I even did that song,
or that it even exists.

00:58:39.250 --> 00:58:41.020
But it was actually
a monster hit.

00:58:44.970 --> 00:58:48.900
And what I believe
you were saying,

00:58:48.900 --> 00:58:53.270
the stuff that emanates from
the inside to the outside,

00:58:53.270 --> 00:58:55.086
it's a very esoteric
question, bro.

00:58:55.086 --> 00:58:55.710
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:58:55.710 --> 00:58:58.920
All the music that you've
heard in your life,

00:58:58.920 --> 00:59:00.030
what have you clung to?

00:59:00.030 --> 00:59:03.342
What have you grasped like, this
is the sound that I make in?

00:59:03.342 --> 00:59:04.050
NILE RODGERS: OK.

00:59:04.050 --> 00:59:08.100
So the music that I've heard,
all the music that I've

00:59:08.100 --> 00:59:13.260
heard in my life, I love
bebop and modern jazz

00:59:13.260 --> 00:59:17.820
the best, maybe fusion
jazz, just because

00:59:17.820 --> 00:59:21.330
of the technical
proficiency, but so is bebop.

00:59:21.330 --> 00:59:23.890
But I love classical music.

00:59:23.890 --> 00:59:26.660
I grew up on classical music.

00:59:26.660 --> 00:59:28.240
So that's what I practice.

00:59:28.240 --> 00:59:32.140
That's what I practice when
I'm at home and I'm playing.

00:59:32.140 --> 00:59:34.680
When I want to just
make myself feel good,

00:59:34.680 --> 00:59:37.610
I'll play a
Thelonious Monk tune.

00:59:37.610 --> 00:59:41.580
The other day, one of my
keyboard players and I,

00:59:41.580 --> 00:59:49.140
we transcribed Eric Dolphy,
a song called "17 West,"

00:59:49.140 --> 00:59:51.025
because we couldn't
find the chart for it.

00:59:51.025 --> 00:59:53.705
And then after we transcribed
it, we looked it up on Google.

00:59:53.705 --> 00:59:55.960
And there it was, "17 West."

00:59:55.960 --> 00:59:58.915
It was like, oh, oops.

00:59:58.915 --> 01:00:00.290
We went through
all that trouble,

01:00:00.290 --> 01:00:03.300
and there it was, right there.

01:00:03.300 --> 01:00:05.790
Yeah, so that's what it is.

01:00:05.790 --> 01:00:10.550
As Al Jarreau says,
I'm a jazzer at heart.

01:00:10.550 --> 01:00:14.060
And that probably has a lot
of influence on my pop music,

01:00:14.060 --> 01:00:17.180
because I want things to be
harmonically interesting.

01:00:17.180 --> 01:00:20.160
I am not a three-chord
rock guy, but boy, I sure

01:00:20.160 --> 01:00:21.460
appreciate "Wild Thing."

01:00:21.460 --> 01:00:22.960
I think that's amazing.

01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:29.640
I'm a two-chord disco guy.

01:00:29.640 --> 01:00:32.680
Our biggest hits
were two chords.

01:00:32.680 --> 01:00:34.840
But it was just the way
that we invert them,

01:00:34.840 --> 01:00:37.990
and the way that we play them,
and the way that we interpret

01:00:37.990 --> 01:00:44.700
those two chords by building
smooth voice leading,

01:00:44.700 --> 01:00:48.916
melodic passages by going
from one chord to the next.

01:00:48.916 --> 01:00:55.130
It's not like you just
go, ah, freak out.

01:00:55.130 --> 01:01:02.470
[PLAYING GUITAR]

01:01:02.470 --> 01:01:26.878
That's the basic, but
I play [PLAYING GUITAR]

01:01:26.878 --> 01:01:30.329
[APPLAUSE]

01:01:31.350 --> 01:01:33.420
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I think
the jazz is there too.

01:01:33.420 --> 01:01:35.544
The jazz chords, the minor
seven chords are there,

01:01:35.544 --> 01:01:36.960
the 11th chord in
"We Are Family."

01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:39.477
All those jazz chords
give the songs interest.

01:01:39.477 --> 01:01:40.310
NILE RODGERS: Right.

01:01:40.310 --> 01:01:42.954
So a song like "We Are Family,"
which is basically just

01:01:42.954 --> 01:01:43.662
[PLAYING GUITAR].

01:01:50.090 --> 01:01:51.210
Right, the 11 chord?

01:01:57.830 --> 01:02:32.958
But that ain't-- the guitar
part is [PLAYING GUITAR]

01:02:32.958 --> 01:02:36.410
[APPLAUSE]

01:02:36.410 --> 01:02:39.540
See, that's fun to play.

01:02:39.540 --> 01:02:42.080
That is a hell of a lot
more fun to play than just,

01:02:42.080 --> 01:02:47.306
[PLAYING GUITAR], we are family.

01:02:47.306 --> 01:02:49.270
I got all my sisters.

01:02:49.270 --> 01:02:50.930
That's not fun.

01:02:50.930 --> 01:03:01.240
But [PLAYING GUITAR] that's fun.

01:03:01.240 --> 01:03:02.051
[APPLAUSE]

01:03:02.051 --> 01:03:03.050
ANANT SHUKLA: All right.

01:03:03.050 --> 01:03:03.730
NILE RODGERS: Thank you.

01:03:03.730 --> 01:03:04.685
ANANT SHUKLA: Unfortunately,
we're of time.

01:03:04.685 --> 01:03:06.434
But let's give--
everybody, let's give him

01:03:06.434 --> 01:03:07.298
a round of applause.

01:03:07.298 --> 01:03:08.690
[APPLAUSE]

01:03:08.690 --> 01:03:10.380
NILE RODGERS: Thank you, guys.

01:03:10.380 --> 01:03:12.290
Thanks a lot.

01:03:12.290 --> 01:03:13.750
ANANT SHUKLA: Thank you, Nile.

01:03:13.750 --> 01:03:15.900
NILE RODGERS: Thank you, bro.
