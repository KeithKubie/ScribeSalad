00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:03.002
We are now 7.3 billion
fellow human beings,

00:00:03.002 --> 00:00:04.737
on the only place we can live

00:00:04.737 --> 00:00:06.539
and in the next twenty five
years, we're going to be

00:00:06.539 --> 00:00:10.810
9 billion fellow human beings
with no other place to go.

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:12.712
<i> I went to Egypt.</i>

00:00:12.712 --> 00:00:16.415
<i>Right before the landscape
of the Great Pyramids of Giza,</i>

00:00:16.415 --> 00:00:18.318
<i>people are fighting for food.</i>

00:00:18.318 --> 00:00:20.052
<i> Because they couldn't
 afford food anymore,</i>

00:00:20.052 --> 00:00:22.055 line:0%
due to the rising cost of wheat.

00:00:22.055 --> 00:00:23.923 line:0%
They had to get government
subsidized bread.

00:00:23.956 --> 00:00:28.260 line:0%
And every day in thousands of
these kiosks across Egypt,

00:00:28.694 --> 00:00:30.696
people are fighting just to
be able to get food.

00:00:30.696 --> 00:00:32.332
Something as basic as bread.

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:33.566
<i> I went to Iowa,</i>

00:00:33.966 --> 00:00:36.136
<i>to look at the bread basket of
the world, the United States.</i>

00:00:36.136 --> 00:00:39.038
<i>This is the Kuntz family, a
fourth generation farmer.</i>

00:00:39.038 --> 00:00:41.640
<i>And boy, the commodity prices
are going through the roof.</i>

00:00:41.841 --> 00:00:44.276
They're making the money,
They're making a bonanza.

00:00:44.276 --> 00:00:47.347
<i>And this family is so engrained,
 they become literally,</i>

00:00:47.347 --> 00:00:49.582
<i> almost reflected
 in their combine.</i>

00:00:49.582 --> 00:00:52.585
<i>Become the product that they
grow, product that they reap.</i>

00:00:52.918 --> 00:00:55.287
But when commodity prices
start to go through the roof,

00:00:55.287 --> 00:00:56.822
because of natural disasters.

00:00:56.822 --> 00:00:59.025
Like in this case,
the Mississippi River,

00:00:59.025 --> 00:01:01.026
<i> flooding the farmlands
 of Iowa.</i>

00:01:01.026 --> 00:01:02.795
<i> Commodity prices go
 through the roof,</i>

00:01:02.795 --> 00:01:05.431
<i> affecting all of us
 across the planet.</i>

00:01:06.032 --> 00:01:08.568
<i>We also are having another
 divergence of food,</i>

00:01:08.568 --> 00:01:11.170
<i>out of our stomachs and into
 the stomachs of pigs,</i>

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.439
<i> and also into the
 stomachs of our cars.</i>

00:01:13.806 --> 00:01:16.241
<i> Raising again,
 the cost of food.</i>

00:01:16.241 --> 00:01:18.143
And that has an enormous impact

00:01:18.143 --> 00:01:19.946
on the cost of how
we feed ourselves.

00:01:19.946 --> 00:01:21.815
We may not notice it
in this country,

00:01:22.315 --> 00:01:26.119
but if you live on two dollars
a day, you'll see that it does.

00:01:26.686 --> 00:01:28.087
We went to the Amazon.

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:31.323
<i>Brazil wants to become the
next bread basket of the world.</i>

00:01:31.323 --> 00:01:35.061
<i>President Dilma as no issues
about cutting down the Amazon.</i>

00:01:35.061 --> 00:01:36.795
There's a brilliant statement
in what she said.

00:01:37.062 --> 00:01:40.332
"Okay, if you want us
to keep the trees

00:01:40.332 --> 00:01:42.368
to produce oxygen, pay us."

00:01:43.402 --> 00:01:45.471
Because they want to have
an economic bounty,

00:01:45.471 --> 00:01:47.340
because that's what we did
in North America.

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.943
That area of all of the midwest
used to be forests and swamps.

00:01:50.943 --> 00:01:54.847
And we created it as the world's
largest bread basket.

00:01:54.847 --> 00:01:57.283
And other nations want to
do the same thing

00:01:57.283 --> 00:01:59.752
We went to India to look at
the Green Revolution.

00:01:59.752 --> 00:02:01.487
India in the sixties
was crippled,

00:02:01.487 --> 00:02:04.791
and hardly able to feed itself,
coming out into independence.

00:02:04.791 --> 00:02:06.725
And in this case,
now they're in a bounty because,

00:02:06.725 --> 00:02:08.728
science and technology
came together,

00:02:08.728 --> 00:02:10.997
fertilizers and pesticides.

00:02:11.164 --> 00:02:12.431
<i>This case a farmer is thrilled.</i>

00:02:12.431 --> 00:02:13.299
<i> Look how many people</i>

00:02:13.499 --> 00:02:15.234
<i> are riding on the top of
 a bounteous harvest.</i>

00:02:15.234 --> 00:02:16.635
<i>You'd never see that in America,</i>

00:02:16.635 --> 00:02:18.371
<i> code police would
 come out and say,</i>

00:02:18.371 --> 00:02:20.105
<i> "Too many people
 on your tractor."</i>

00:02:20.105 --> 00:02:21.574
I think it's beautiful actually.

00:02:21.574 --> 00:02:22.642
( audience laughter )

00:02:22.642 --> 00:02:25.511
But they, they polluted
their water table system.

00:02:25.745 --> 00:02:28.380
<i> And in the Punjab region
 of Northwest India,</i>

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.517
<i> birth defects and cancer
 rates through the roof.</i>

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:34.454
<i> All in order to try to
 feed ourselves.</i>

00:02:34.687 --> 00:02:37.256
In the Philippines, with the
rising commodity prices,

00:02:37.256 --> 00:02:39.124
children want to become
farmers again.

00:02:39.124 --> 00:02:41.995
Instead of going to the city in
metro Manila or overseas

00:02:41.995 --> 00:02:44.263
to work in houses
in Saudi Arabia

00:02:44.263 --> 00:02:45.298
and Hong Kong
as housekeepers.

00:02:45.298 --> 00:02:45.998
Why?

00:02:46.398 --> 00:02:47.633
Because you can make a
living to be a farmer again.

00:02:47.633 --> 00:02:49.635
<i> And here younger
 children are learning,</i>

00:02:49.635 --> 00:02:52.037
<i> from their grandparents,
 how to be farmers again.</i>

00:02:52.037 --> 00:02:53.038
<i> So, pretty neat.</i>

00:02:53.305 --> 00:02:54.373
<i> And in the Philippines,</i>

00:02:54.373 --> 00:02:56.609
<i>is the International Rice
 Research Institute</i>

00:02:56.609 --> 00:02:59.044
<i>where everyday rice comes in
 from all over the world,</i>

00:02:59.044 --> 00:03:01.547
<i> and hands deftly sort
 each grain of rice</i>

00:03:01.547 --> 00:03:03.583
<i>for the strongest grains.</i>

00:03:03.583 --> 00:03:05.184
And here's how
it's so important.

00:03:05.184 --> 00:03:06.986
When Pol Pot decimated

00:03:06.986 --> 00:03:09.254
the agricultural
industry of Cambodia,

00:03:09.254 --> 00:03:11.491
all of their rice fields
got destroyed.

00:03:11.991 --> 00:03:14.793
And they couldn't grow
rice properly anymore

00:03:14.793 --> 00:03:16.996
when they brought in rice from
Thailand and elsewhere.

00:03:16.996 --> 00:03:19.365
And IRRI, International Rice
Research Institute,

00:03:19.365 --> 00:03:22.401
had a small packet of
seeds in their vault,

00:03:22.401 --> 00:03:24.370
and they brought those
seeds back to Cambodia,

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:25.471
and to this day,

00:03:25.571 --> 00:03:28.674
the Cambodians are growing
their own indigenous rice again.

00:03:28.674 --> 00:03:30.376
All because of these hands,

00:03:30.376 --> 00:03:33.012
deftly sorting out the
strongest genes of seed.
