00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.159
Hey, it's me Destin welcome back to Smarter Every Day

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.429
I've been waiting on a sunny day to do this. You remember the last video

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:11.610
I fired a 38 special versus a Prince Rupert's drop, and the Prince Rupert's drop won. Well, we're going to fix that today

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.000
We've got the high speed camera back out, and even though it beat

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.539
full metal jacket rounds last time you remember I fired the 22 magnum and this particular prince Rupert's drop survived and then I fired the

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:26.039
38 special and it survived. We're to move up here. So now we've got this is my mini 14

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.730
It's comparable to an AR-15 except I like Poor Man guns

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:35.459
This is a much different round, a lot higher velocity. It's pointy, I know that sounds silly

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:36.719
But I think it matters

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.219
I think a pointy bullet is going to create more of a localized stress on the Prince Rupert's drop

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.579
I think it's going to beat it

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:48.628
We've got the AK-47 if the Mini-14 doesn't work and now the AK-47 round, a lot more mass here.

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:53.129
So if that doesn't work, we'll just put more energy into it. Then, if that doesn't work,

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:58.679
Mosin Nagant. If you don't know anything about Mosin Nagant, this is like, it's a big deal.

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.409
You can see there's a lot more energy there. Anyway, let's get to shooting.

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:07.470
There's a lot going on here.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.409
It's gone. I think we beat the Prince Rupert's drop. Yeah surely.

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:28.259
Yes, we totally beat it

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.540
And there's light!

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.100
There's a light that goes off and it turns it into a fiber-optic.

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.510
A lot of light, okay this light thing. I want to talk about it

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:58.380
It's something called triboluminescence, and I had to research that because I didn't know about it

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:04.770
You know the Prince Rupert's drop was first investigated in the 1600s right, well the same thing was true for triboluminescence.

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:09.329
Sir Francis Bacon, the father of the Scientific method says this:

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:14.369
It is well known that all sugar whether candied or plain, if it be hard

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.929
will sparkle when broken or scraped in the dark. They knew that in

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:26.100
1620. A lot of people don't know that today if you have hard candy thats sugar, and you put it down there.

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.589
And you have well-adjusted eyes and you smash it,

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.680
you can see sparks.

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.030
 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:23.479
I think it's amazing that 400 years after triboluminescence was first documented, the scientific community still does not completely

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.300
understand what's happening. That's amazing.

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.120
That's cool. I want to do it again.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.179
We've got to do the AK just because we can.

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.120
That's how that works.

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.429
All right, here we go. It's a very expensive camera-mount by the way

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.430
No, no

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:10.180
No

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.519
We saw the - we saw the light again

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:21.739
There was a localized light this time

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:28.249
It's just a glancing blow, but it was enough to destroy the bullet that's an AK round! Look at that!

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:46.220
Come back. I'm not really aiming. I'm just kind of looking... Oh man, we cut

00:04:55.690 --> 00:05:03.089
Okay, weapon's clear. I didn't see any powder. I have no idea what just happened

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:31.118
That thing didn't even try to stand a chance to that

00:05:33.349 --> 00:05:35.349
Man

00:05:36.229 --> 00:05:38.229
Beautiful. I think we have our answer

00:05:40.369 --> 00:05:41.899
once you get

00:05:41.899 --> 00:05:44.678
faster bullets that are that pointy

00:05:45.379 --> 00:05:48.579
They can easily beat the Prince Rupert's drop. Now we know

00:05:49.879 --> 00:05:53.139
Okay, one more thing that falls into the "just because I can" category.

00:05:54.139 --> 00:06:00.098
This is the biggest Prince Rupert's drop I've ever seen. It's got like multiple shapes and stuff

00:06:00.099 --> 00:06:01.909
It's really scary

00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:03.439
I'm going to try to

00:06:03.439 --> 00:06:10.088
Set it in tannerite and see what happens when we shoot the tannerite see what a shockwave externally does I don't think it'll break.

00:06:10.339 --> 00:06:12.339
I just want to see what will happen

00:06:17.059 --> 00:06:22.059
Mom, there's about to be a big boom! Okay, before we go blow stuff up. I've got to share this letter with you

00:06:22.059 --> 00:06:28.148
I'm a dad right, so when you get a letter from a little girl named Paisley in California you pay attention. Check this out

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:33.189
Dear Destin. My name is Paisley. I am in second grade. I am seven years old.

00:06:33.189 --> 00:06:37.329
I love your videos. My favorite is the tempered glass one because I like to smash things.

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:42.009
But my mom won't let me. Darn it. My mom says I'm crazy because I am. I'm homeschooled

00:06:42.009 --> 00:06:47.799
I'm good at art. My dog had puppies. I love science and math I am left-handed. Love

00:06:48.379 --> 00:06:50.269
Paisley. Paisley,

00:06:50.269 --> 00:06:51.699
This is an adorable letter,

00:06:51.699 --> 00:06:56.648
And I thank you very much for it. The really cool thing about this to me though is your name

00:06:56.979 --> 00:07:00.968
Paisley that reminds me of the fabric Pattern

00:07:01.369 --> 00:07:04.299
Paisley which looks to me like Prince Rupert's drops.

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:09.939
This is really really cool because it made me think about why we don't have a shirt at the smartereveryday

00:07:10.039 --> 00:07:13.658
website that has prince rupert drops on it. So you just inspired me to do that. So

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:18.039
Paisley, I'm going to send you a shirt for anybody else. You can go check the shirt out.

00:07:18.039 --> 00:07:22.598
But it's for Paisley. One more thing Paisley, your mom who won't let you smash things,

00:07:23.719 --> 00:07:28.629
if you tell her you're going to be doing science, she'll probably let you smash things.

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:33.399
Okay, if you want to take the bait go check out the shirts, and you should totally take the bait.

00:07:33.639 --> 00:07:34.789
I'll leave a link down in the video description.

00:07:34.789 --> 00:07:39.458
You can go to the website while you're there, as you know audible has supported smarter every day for quite a while.

00:07:39.559 --> 00:07:45.169
But I've made a website that details every book I've ever listened to on audible and what I thought about it.

00:07:45.169 --> 00:07:47.748
It's really kind of fun. Anyway, one in particular

00:07:47.749 --> 00:07:52.099
I want you to check out is Ready Player One. On the next episode of no dumb questions,

00:07:52.289 --> 00:07:57.348
which is a podcast I do with Matt Whitman. We're going to talk about Ready Player One because it's a discussion we've been wanting to

00:07:57.349 --> 00:07:58.459
Have for a really long time.

00:07:58.459 --> 00:08:04.609
It's a good book. Probably not for the kids, but it's really deep. If you want to do this with us go to audible.com/smarter

00:08:05.129 --> 00:08:10.398
and download Ready Player One or just smash the big red button that I got on the website there. Again

00:08:10.399 --> 00:08:15.649
That's audible.com/smarter get a copy Ready Player One and right now.,It's time to go blow stuff up.

00:08:16.529 --> 00:08:18.529
Mom, there's about to be a big boom.

00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:21.740
Complete professional.

00:08:23.819 --> 00:08:30.979
Wow, holy cow it's raining Prince Rupert's drop. That's amazing.

00:08:53.970 --> 00:09:01.639
Okie-doke that was fun. Things happened here. Wow

00:09:06.389 --> 00:09:08.389
What do you think chicken?
