FEMALE SPEAKER: Please join
me in welcoming Deb

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:08.105
Perelman to the stage.

00:00:08.105 --> 00:00:08.540
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:10.730
DEB PERELMAN: Hi.

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:12.450
Thank you so much for having
me here today.

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.560
I'm so excited to be here.

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:15.990
I'm a total Google dork.

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.650
I am.

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:21.600
I actually read my entire life
from Google documents.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.840
It's actually what the inside
of my brain looks like.

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.650
I have like this series of--

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.030
it sounds kind of weird.

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:30.410
Basically, everything that I
ever need to remember, I have

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:31.670
to pull up on a Google Doc.

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:34.850
So yes, I'm very excited
to be here.

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.510
Anyway, thank you.

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:43.160
And this fall, Smitten Kitchen
turned six years old.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.400
It would be a first grader.

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.820
It would be talking back, which
seems about appropriate

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.420
for me being up here.

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.150
And I'm often asked how I got
the site started, but I tend

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:55.560
to drag my feet.

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.980
I know that bloggers are
supposed to like to talk about

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.460
themselves, but I hate it.

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.349
I think it's really awkward
because basically, my life

00:01:04.349 --> 00:01:05.590
story is I like to cook.

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.020
I wrote a book.

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.960
The end.

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.660
But I suppose you'd like
to hear a little

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:11.970
bit more than that.

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.040
So I'm just going to tell you
just like this much more.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.940
And then what I'd love to do is
answer questions, because I

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:20.000
love answering questions.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.250
I think it's way more
interesting.

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.230
When I registered the domain
name, Smitten Kitchen, in the

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:30.310
summer of 2006, I actually
expected it to

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.860
be a six-month endeavor.

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.810
I imagined that was about how
long most blogs lasted.

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.810
And I didn't expect this one to
last, because I read a lot

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.350
of food blogs at the time.

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:42.230
There were a bunch.

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:46.960
I read Adam Roberts' Amateur
Gourmet and Lisa Fain's

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:47.890
Homesick Texan.

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.220
And what each blog I read
had in common was that

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:53.030
they have an angle.

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.520
They have a story they're
telling about Texan food that

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.630
you miss or teaching yourself
how to be a gourmet chef.

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.120
And I don't have an angle.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.890
I just like to cook.

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:08.130
And so I didn't imagine that
the blog would last.

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.020
But I do remember what
I was looking for.

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:16.560
And Google actually comes into
play here, too, because I

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.120
remember very early on the
site I wanted to make a

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.750
birthday cake for a friend.

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.470
And I knew exactly what
kind of birthday

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:24.640
cake I wanted to make.

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.130
I wanted to make one of those
yellow, layer, buttery,

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:32.010
vanilla-scented, plush birthday
cakes for a friend.

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.900
And I didn't have a go-to
recipe for it.

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.140
I was somebody who liked to
cook, but I didn't have these

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:39.430
go-to recipes.

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:46.760
And I decided to Google "best
birthday cake." And 1,670,000

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:47.830
results appeared.

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.240
You guys don't seem remotely
surprised by this.

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:51.580
I guess you know that.

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.250
And I had no idea
where to start.

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.090
So I started with
the first one.

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.170
And it was OK.

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.990
It was fine.

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.590
It was good.

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.120
I mean, it probably would
have been good enough.

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.540
But I'm really picky, and
I wanted to do something

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:05.170
different with it.

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:07.630
I wanted to use buttermilk.

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.290
I had all of these ideas
for birthday cake, and

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:12.290
it wasn't that one.

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.840
So I got to fiddling with it.

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.630
and I ended up coming up with a
cake that I thought I wanted

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.090
people to get to first.

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.110
And I wanted to share that with
people, because as much

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:26.710
as I love and adore Google, I
didn't want it to be this huge

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:29.650
recipe roulette when you are
trying to figure out what to

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.160
make for dinner or when you want
to make birthday cake.

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.570
Most birthday cakes are made
pretty much at like, what,

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:36.840
11:00 PM the night before
your husband's or

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:37.980
kid's birthday party.

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.520
And you're just hoping to get
it right the first time.

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:44.430
You guys seem like really nice
people, but I don't think

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.440
you're going to apologize if the
cake is a disaster, and it

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:52.150
slumps on the floor at
2:00 in the morning.

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.820
So I knew what kind of recipes
I wanted to make.

00:03:54.820 --> 00:04:01.190
But at the time, I was
an IT reporter.

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:03.530
Oh boy, if I haven't put you
to sleep yet, I should tell

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:06.000
you guys about my days
being an IT reporter.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.800
Oh boy.

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:10.090
I have no idea what I was
doing as an IT reporter.

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:12.150
If you met some of my former
co-workers, they would be

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:13.610
really nice about things.

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:15.450
But they would be like, we
have no idea what she was

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:17.630
doing as an IT reporter,
either.

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:20.550
I had no business writing
about IT or reporting.

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:23.450
But nevertheless,
it was my job.

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:26.410
And it was one of many
iterations of my so-called

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:27.340
career to date.

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:29.740
I've also been an
art therapist.

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.080
I have been a barista.

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.240
I used to write happy
birthday on bakery

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:35.550
cakes in high school.

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:37.260
I've taught swim lessons.

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:41.940
I have swirled frozen custard
after college classes.

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:43.620
I've had a lot of weird jobs.

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.520
I wouldn't say that I've
been particularly

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.620
good at any of them.

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.390
But they're what I did.

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:57.380
And I think what's even more
improbable or illogical is

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:01.270
that I decided I wanted to start
this food site, because

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:02.750
as I've made clear,
I don't know a

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:05.720
whole lot about writing.

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:09.920
And my kitchen is about
the size of--

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:12.200
like this is probably
my entire kitchen

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:13.480
counter right here.

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:15.640
I have this tiny Manhattan
kitchen, something I'm sure a

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:17.170
lot of you guys are
familiar with.

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:19.900
And I am not a photographer.

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:23.160
I do not know what half the
buttons on my camera do.

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:27.360
I just kind of just play around
until I get what I'm

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.650
looking for or not,
close enough.

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:32.370
And I've never really learned
to write properly.

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:34.230
I never went to journalism
school or anything.

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:36.620
In fact, this entire talk
has been one long

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:39.420
run-on sentence so far.

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:42.860
But I wanted to start
this site.

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:47.100
And I remember the thing that
happened very early on, the

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:50.220
thing that kind of changed it
for me, was I remember very

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:51.780
early on I'd shared a recipe.

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:53.040
And someone said--

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:53.870
they left me a comment.

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:55.830
And they were like, I made
your recipe last night.

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:58.800
I was like, mine?

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.020
You made mine?

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:04.270
You had one hour of free time
after putting your kid to bed,

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:06.940
and groceries are expensive,
and you don't know

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:07.920
anything about me.

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:09.330
And you made this recipe?

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:12.110
I was completely flattered,
and very

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:14.610
humbled, and utterly terrified.

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:17.620
I realized that if people were
going to spend their time

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:21.000
actually making these recipes,
I better start knowing what

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.800
I'm doing quickly.

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:24.720
Time to start figuring it out.

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:28.230
So that was around the time--

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:30.290
after one comment, there
became more and more.

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:32.430
And what was happening in the
comments is that people were

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:36.070
asking me questions, because I
had mistakenly given them the

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:38.110
impression that I knew
what I was doing.

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:41.010
People would ask me, can
I use cake flour

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:42.410
instead of regular flour?

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:45.040
What if I only have salted
butter, not unsalted?

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:47.240
And what if I only have
extra large eggs?

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:50.220
Ina Garten only uses extra large
eggs, and you only use

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:51.150
large eggs.

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:52.480
What am I supposed to do?

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:55.060
So people would ask me all
of these crazy questions.

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:58.190
And I would scramble to get
answers, because they were

00:06:58.190 --> 00:06:59.530
there, and I wanted to help.

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:02.940
And I actually feel that over
the years, answering all of

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:05.370
these questions have really
helped me become a better

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:08.410
cook, that it was the comments,
it was the readers

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:11.870
asking these things that I had
to figure out the answer to

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:15.760
that really helped.

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:19.850
Anyway, so I started the site
in the fall of 2006.

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:23.460
And in 2008, I quit
my day job.

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:26.610
I'm sure they were like,
see you later.

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:29.090
Don't let the door hit you.

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:29.910
But I quit my day--

00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:33.790
and it was completely
terrifying, as I'm sure, if

00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:36.950
any of you have experienced the
deciding that you do not

00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:38.930
need your safety net anymore.

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:41.290
But I think it was actually
really good for me, because it

00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:44.480
really gave me permission to
start working on the kind of

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:46.030
recipes I wanted to work on.

00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:47.890
I had been sort of fumbling
along on this site.

00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:51.840
But now I had this grant to
start creating the kind of

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:53.580
recipes I wanted to each day.

00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:56.780
And it was really fun for me.

00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:59.040
And I think the site
probably took off a

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:00.870
bit more after then.

00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:06.800
Anyway, if you cook lunch for
your friends today, and you

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:09.760
make them, like, a really great
roast chicken, and a

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:13.020
salad, and whatever else you do,
it's going to be amazing,

00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:14.720
because you are an
amazing cook.

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:16.230
And your friends are going
to go, oh my god.

00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:18.570
This is the best roast chicken
I've ever had in my entire

00:08:18.570 --> 00:08:20.160
life, and I love this.

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:23.210
And you should open a
restaurant, because this is

00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:23.730
what people do.

00:08:23.730 --> 00:08:24.950
They say you should
open a restaurant.

00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:28.560
And with all due respect, I
think it's a terrible idea.

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:30.740
I think that opening a
restaurant because you cook

00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:32.409
chicken well is a
really bad idea.

00:08:32.409 --> 00:08:35.230
And a similar thing happens when
you have a food blog that

00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:37.039
has more than two
comments a day.

00:08:37.039 --> 00:08:39.049
People say, you should
write a cookbook.

00:08:39.049 --> 00:08:40.640
And I said, oh absolutely not.

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:42.620
I think writing a cookbook
is the worst idea

00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:43.340
in the entire world.

00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:47.580
And I will never, ever,
ever write a cookbook.

00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:48.830
The end.

00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:52.820
But that kept happening.

00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:54.490
And I kept saying no.

00:08:54.490 --> 00:08:57.230
And that went on for about
another two or three years.

00:08:57.230 --> 00:08:59.910
And it would've stayed
that way.

00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:02.300
And I would not be probably
standing here today.

00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:04.920
But what happened was-- and I'm
sure not the first person

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:07.570
to say this-- but
I got pregnant.

00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:12.130
And I know it's sort of cheesy,
but becoming a parent

00:09:12.130 --> 00:09:15.310
sort of shifted my paradigm
a little bit.

00:09:15.310 --> 00:09:17.830
OK, it was the hormones.

00:09:17.830 --> 00:09:21.370
I was like, my baby is never
going to know what I do when

00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:21.700
he grows up.

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:25.130
I was like, he can't hold
a website in his hand.

00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:26.410
He won't know what I did.

00:09:26.410 --> 00:09:27.970
And he'll never know
about these meals.

00:09:27.970 --> 00:09:29.020
And what if this website--

00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:31.450
I get tired of doing it,
and then I don't do it.

00:09:31.450 --> 00:09:35.890
Anyway, so very logical,
rational line of thought led

00:09:35.890 --> 00:09:39.470
me to deciding that I was
going to write a book.

00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:42.490
But it wasn't just
that simple.

00:09:42.490 --> 00:09:45.190
Despite saying OK, maybe I'll
write a book, I was still a

00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:47.140
little resistant to the idea.

00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:49.410
I am so in love with
the web format.

00:09:49.410 --> 00:09:52.080
I wasn't one of these people who
was just like, oh, I have

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:53.700
a blog, and I hope I
get a book deal.

00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:55.900
I was like, I have a blog, and
I hope if I write a book, it

00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:56.870
doesn't ruin the site.

00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:59.720
Because I really feel like
I love doing the site.

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:03.600
I love being able to write
long introductions.

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:05.160
You can't really fit
those in books.

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:07.770
I like to be able to talk
for as long as I

00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:11.520
want, as you can see.

00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:13.300
I love being able to
add process photos.

00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:17.250
Most cookbooks, they just show
you a final shot, if even one.

00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:19.620
And it looks really pretty,
but I don't think it helps

00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:23.740
people as much cook that recipe
as a few details from

00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:26.330
the recipe, like what the onions
look like when you chop

00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:28.670
them or what the frosting
texture is going

00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:29.660
to be on the beaters.

00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:30.910
I think those things
really help.

00:10:30.910 --> 00:10:34.280
And I wanted the cookbook
to include that.

00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:39.870
And I really like comments
on websites.

00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:43.110
I didn't know how I was going to
be able to have those in a

00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:44.670
paper book.

00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:46.800
And I still don't, actually.

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:50.030
So I had this whole crazy list
of rules for the book that I

00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:52.990
basically wrote knowing that
nobody was ever going to agree

00:10:52.990 --> 00:10:54.250
to them, and I'd never
actually have

00:10:54.250 --> 00:10:55.450
to write the book.

00:10:55.450 --> 00:10:59.560
That was my great, really
professional plan.

00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:01.640
And the first one was that
I wanted to have

00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:02.760
these longer intros.

00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:05.505
I wanted to have as many process
photos as possible.

00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:12.260
Although it was going to be
called "The Smitten Kitchen

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:13.600
Cookbook," I didn't want
it to just have

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:14.750
recipes from the site.

00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:16.990
I wanted it to be mostly new.

00:11:16.990 --> 00:11:20.190
And the book is, in fact,
85% new recipes.

00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:23.900
I didn't want people to buy a
book that they could just get

00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:24.650
for free online.

00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:28.630
It seemed kind of insulting
to ask people to do that.

00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:31.790
And then, as if I hadn't had
a ridiculous enough list of

00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:34.205
demands, I heard about this
thing called lay-flat binding.

00:11:34.205 --> 00:11:36.150
You know when you're in the
kitchen, and you have a

00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:38.540
cookbook open, and it closes
on you, I didn't

00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:39.570
want it to do that.

00:11:39.570 --> 00:11:41.600
I think I'm like the first
author ever that came to a

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:44.410
publisher and said, and here's
the kind of binding I want.

00:11:44.410 --> 00:11:47.850
I mean, I was really trying
to get them to say no.

00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:52.730
And it didn't work, which
is why I'm here.

00:11:52.730 --> 00:11:57.750
The last harebrained idea I had
was that I thought, even

00:11:57.750 --> 00:12:00.650
though I was about to have a
newborn, and I'd never written

00:12:00.650 --> 00:12:04.570
a book before, and I have this
full-time job, which is taking

00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:06.660
care of my website,
no big deal.

00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:10.060
I was going to write the book
in six months, because isn't

00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:12.000
that like a normal amount
of time to write a book?

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.425
So I was absolutely insistent
that I was going to finish it

00:12:14.425 --> 00:12:15.060
in six months.

00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:16.980
And I insisted that they put
it in the contract and

00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:18.540
everything.

00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:19.580
So that was really great.

00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:24.510
So three years later,
the book is here.

00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:27.850
I kind of like to call
it my second baby.

00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:33.360
At 336 pages and 2.8 pounds,
I think she's a beaut.

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:38.430
And I dedicated her
to my first baby.

00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:41.030
And now I would be happy
to answer any

00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:42.320
questions you have--

00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:44.500
almost any, most questions.

00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:46.140
I will not answer the question
of when I'm going to have

00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:48.510
another kid, because I know
my mom put you up to it.

00:12:48.510 --> 00:12:51.420
And she's totally busted.

00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:52.030
Oh what?

00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:56.020
You want me to-- oh, use the mic
over there or over there--

00:12:56.020 --> 00:13:00.040
awesome-- if you want to ask
a question or heckle me.

00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:01.070
Heckling is fine.

00:13:01.070 --> 00:13:02.320
I can handle it.

00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:06.110
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:13:06.110 --> 00:13:07.240
I'm Melissa.

00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:09.910
I love your blog so much.

00:13:09.910 --> 00:13:11.030
I've gotten away with--

00:13:11.030 --> 00:13:13.390
like, people think that I'm an
amazing cook, and I'm not--

00:13:13.390 --> 00:13:13.850
DEB PERELMAN: You are
an amazing cook.

00:13:13.850 --> 00:13:15.100
AUDIENCE: --because it's
so self-explanatory.

00:13:17.090 --> 00:13:20.630
I guess one, with the photos,
how do you do the photos if

00:13:20.630 --> 00:13:22.380
you don't think of yourself
as a photographer?

00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:24.330
Because I think that's a really
rich part of the site.

00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:28.910
And also, what was the catalyst
to sort of decide

00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:31.820
that you wanted to make the
leap, besides just like

00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:34.725
disenchantment with your old
job and interest in this?

00:13:37.450 --> 00:13:40.000
DEB PERELMAN: So Melissa
asked about the photos.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.300
And I really do consider myself
a photography hack.

00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:45.590
I mean, there are people who
can have very serious

00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:49.420
conversations about lighting
and scrims and aperture.

00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:51.830
And I'm like, I'm just
like reading

00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:52.740
those words in my head.

00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:54.850
I don't even know what
half of them mean.

00:13:54.850 --> 00:13:56.620
I really just kind
of fiddle around.

00:13:56.620 --> 00:13:58.250
I like working by a window.

00:13:58.250 --> 00:14:01.120
Natural light makes
things easy.

00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:02.300
I use a DSLR.

00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:05.160
And I use a 50-millimeter
lens, which is often

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:07.740
considered a portrait lens,
because I really like to take

00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:08.370
sharp pictures.

00:14:08.370 --> 00:14:10.290
I know what I want the
photos to look like.

00:14:10.290 --> 00:14:11.540
I'm just not--

00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:13.560
the difference, I think, is a
professional photographer

00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:14.560
could make it happen.

00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:16.990
And I just kind of
hope it happens.

00:14:16.990 --> 00:14:17.970
Cross my fingers.

00:14:17.970 --> 00:14:20.340
Maybe today will be the day
I get the shot I want.

00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:22.980
But I mostly just take photos
as I'm working.

00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:27.060
I keep the camera right outside
the kitchen on a shelf

00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:29.450
one foot higher than
my son can reach.

00:14:29.450 --> 00:14:31.780
And I just usually
just grab it.

00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:34.150
And I've gotten in the habit
of just taking photos at

00:14:34.150 --> 00:14:37.660
almost every step, just because
I find that if I

00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:39.470
don't, it will be the time that
it worked out perfectly

00:14:39.470 --> 00:14:40.080
the first time.

00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:41.330
I'm like, d'oh.

00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:46.940
I use auto focus.

00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:50.040
I mean, I'm such a hack.

00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:52.450
And you had asked about
how I knew it was

00:14:52.450 --> 00:14:54.420
time to make the leap.

00:14:54.420 --> 00:14:57.120
Well, I've always had
ads on my site.

00:14:57.120 --> 00:14:58.760
I try to keep them
small and subtle.

00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:01.220
I like people who come to the
site to know that they're more

00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:04.350
important than the little
stuff in the sidebar.

00:15:04.350 --> 00:15:07.010
But I've always had
ad earnings.

00:15:07.010 --> 00:15:10.640
And basically, as the site grew,
the ad earnings grew.

00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:14.600
And because I was, like, the
worst reporter in the world, I

00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:17.035
had basically no salary
to speak of.

00:15:17.035 --> 00:15:20.950
So getting the outside salary
to match the job salary was

00:15:20.950 --> 00:15:25.140
not quite the process it would
be if you had a real job.

00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:27.400
So for me, it was really just
about figuring out if I could

00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:29.310
make do without my
day job salary.

00:15:29.310 --> 00:15:31.095
And that was basically
what happened.

00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:36.840
I mean, you guys know this, but
websites make money the

00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:39.960
same way television shows and
magazines and newspapers do.

00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:42.090
They just sell ads along
side the content.

00:15:42.090 --> 00:15:46.010
So the more popular the show,
magazine, readership is, the

00:15:46.010 --> 00:15:49.132
more money there
is to be made.

00:15:49.132 --> 00:15:49.650
But you guys know this.

00:15:49.650 --> 00:15:52.080
You've got Google Ads.

00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:52.730
Hi.

00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:54.775
Oh, hi.

00:15:54.775 --> 00:15:59.180
AUDIENCE: I'm wondering, what
are some of the best tips or

00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:02.100
hints that you would have to
cooking in a small kitchen?

00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:08.450
DEB PERELMAN: Actually, I love
that question, because I have

00:16:08.450 --> 00:16:09.540
lived in New York
for a long time.

00:16:09.540 --> 00:16:10.910
And I didn't cook
the whole time.

00:16:10.910 --> 00:16:12.970
And I didn't cook
in my dorm room.

00:16:12.970 --> 00:16:16.310
And I was not this great,
motivated, young cooker.

00:16:16.310 --> 00:16:20.540
I think it helps to start with
something that you really

00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:24.030
hunger, like that you're hungry
for, something specific

00:16:24.030 --> 00:16:25.640
that you're craving
that you don't--

00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:26.490
this is New York City.

00:16:26.490 --> 00:16:28.450
You can get most foods
pretty well.

00:16:28.450 --> 00:16:31.120
But there are still some where
you're like, nobody makes

00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:32.670
tomato soup the way I like it.

00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:35.320
Nobody makes this
wild rice pilaf.

00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:37.630
OK, I'm probably the only one
has weird cravings for wild

00:16:37.630 --> 00:16:38.440
rice pilaf.

00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:39.080
Pie?

00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:39.980
How about pie?

00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:42.180
But to start with something that
you're not getting the

00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:44.710
way you want, so you'll be super
motivated to deal with

00:16:44.710 --> 00:16:47.220
all the limitations of
your tiny kitchen.

00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:48.870
I mean tiny kitchens are
absolutely annoying.

00:16:48.870 --> 00:16:51.530
But if you're hungry enough, and
you want that enough, and

00:16:51.530 --> 00:16:53.460
you're excited enough
to make it, I think

00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:55.430
you'll put up with it.

00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:57.970
Beyond that, I think that you
should clear your counters,

00:16:57.970 --> 00:16:59.180
get all the clutter
off of them.

00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:00.600
Like forget the coffee maker.

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:02.660
You can go out and buy coffee.

00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:05.520
You can leave on what you want,
but I actually just

00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:06.190
clear the decks.

00:17:06.190 --> 00:17:10.270
I don't keep anything besides
maybe some salt, like pinch

00:17:10.270 --> 00:17:13.050
dishes, on my counter
most times.

00:17:13.050 --> 00:17:15.700
And it really helps you feel
like, at least if you have the

00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:16.700
space, you have enough.

00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:18.819
And remember that at all your
favorite restaurants in the

00:17:18.819 --> 00:17:22.010
city, they are working with
stations about this big, too.

00:17:22.010 --> 00:17:24.140
And they put out like what,
hundreds of meals a night?

00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:26.450
So we can probably make do.

00:17:26.450 --> 00:17:28.170
But I think the main
thing is to just to

00:17:28.170 --> 00:17:30.510
start with one recipe.

00:17:30.510 --> 00:17:33.270
It doesn't have to be a Smitten
Kitchen recipe.

00:17:33.270 --> 00:17:36.130
When I'm googling for a recipe
or looking, I gravitate

00:17:36.130 --> 00:17:38.850
towards recipes that have
comments and reviews,

00:17:38.850 --> 00:17:42.670
sometimes to just have one or
two outside people saying, oh

00:17:42.670 --> 00:17:44.670
my god, I made this, and it was
wonderful, gives me the

00:17:44.670 --> 00:17:46.000
confidence to know that
I'm not going to

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.780
totally waste my time.

00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:50.130
And then just start
from there.

00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:51.520
And then move onto
the next thing.

00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:54.350
And soon, you'll have a
repertoire of things that you

00:17:54.350 --> 00:17:57.300
make, that you can make as an
alternative to going out or

00:17:57.300 --> 00:18:00.830
ordering in all the time.

00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:03.225
AUDIENCE: I have another
small kitchen question.

00:18:03.225 --> 00:18:03.600
DEB PERELMAN: Sure.

00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:06.450
AUDIENCE: Where do you find the
space to store all of your

00:18:06.450 --> 00:18:08.070
gadgets and things
for the kitchen?

00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:08.860
That's my first question.

00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:11.500
And then, I'm also wondering,
what are some of your favorite

00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:14.970
restaurants in New York?

00:18:14.970 --> 00:18:17.830
DEB PERELMAN: I store things
in my son's room.

00:18:17.830 --> 00:18:18.640
I don't know.

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:20.280
Things are just everywhere
these days.

00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:21.860
At one point, I was
really good.

00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:23.760
Like the New York rule
is like, one thing

00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:24.740
in, one thing out.

00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:26.510
You get a new pan, you have
to get rid of an old pan.

00:18:26.510 --> 00:18:28.830
Or you get a new sweater,
you have to get

00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:29.870
rid of an old sweater.

00:18:29.870 --> 00:18:32.180
Something fell out of balance
over the process of

00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:34.170
me writing the book.

00:18:34.170 --> 00:18:36.900
And I have this stack of stuff
in the living room.

00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:38.430
It looks terrible.

00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:42.240
But beyond that pile of
doom, I actually--

00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:45.360
our kitchen is so small, and it
has, like, three cabinets.

00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:47.970
And when we moved in, I realized
that I could either

00:18:47.970 --> 00:18:51.250
keep dishes in there, or I
could keep food in there.

00:18:51.250 --> 00:18:53.930
I knew there was no way
I could keep both.

00:18:53.930 --> 00:18:56.870
And so what we actually did
is we got a china cabinet.

00:18:56.870 --> 00:18:58.480
And we put it out in
the living room.

00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:00.750
And so one day, it might
actually hold china.

00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:03.430
Now it holds everyday glasses
and dishes and flatware.

00:19:03.430 --> 00:19:05.070
So that's been a big help.

00:19:05.070 --> 00:19:09.080
The other thing I'm a huge fan
of is get a pot and pan rack.

00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:10.350
My kitchen is so tiny.

00:19:10.350 --> 00:19:11.740
But I just have a flat one.

00:19:11.740 --> 00:19:13.020
It's like a rail.

00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:15.770
And it's over the window.

00:19:15.770 --> 00:19:19.640
And just anchor it with the
heaviest, strongest--

00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:21.700
you're like, oh I only have
200 pounds of pots.

00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:21.800
It's OK.

00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:22.910
Get the 500 bolt.

00:19:22.910 --> 00:19:25.190
You're not going to
be sad about it.

00:19:25.190 --> 00:19:26.520
Get it anchored up
really well.

00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:30.360
And the other thing is I have
some space above my cabinets,

00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:33.070
which would normally be a
dust and grease trap.

00:19:33.070 --> 00:19:34.390
It probably still is.

00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:36.720
But I have some of those
vertical plate

00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:38.430
racks, or file folders.

00:19:38.430 --> 00:19:40.550
And I keep a lot of my
bakeware up there.

00:19:40.550 --> 00:19:46.010
So you don't have that stuff
cluttering up your cabinets.

00:19:46.010 --> 00:19:48.530
So anything you can do to just
clear the space out.

00:19:48.530 --> 00:19:51.250
After that, it's really just
about deciding if you really

00:19:51.250 --> 00:19:55.380
need two peelers or you really
need, like, eight knives.

00:19:55.380 --> 00:19:56.580
Maybe you don't need
a knife block.

00:19:56.580 --> 00:19:57.990
Maybe just one knife will do.

00:19:57.990 --> 00:20:02.430
So after that, it's just choices
and yelling sometimes,

00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:05.280
because it is really annoying.

00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:06.920
Wait, did you have a second
question, or is that it?

00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:08.370
AUDIENCE: My second question
was what are some of your

00:20:08.370 --> 00:20:10.470
favorite New York restaurants?

00:20:10.470 --> 00:20:12.650
DEB PERELMAN: Hmm, well, on
the way over here, we were

00:20:12.650 --> 00:20:15.540
talking about Wallse, which
is this-- probably

00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:16.580
not terribly popular.

00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:18.470
It's like Austrian, German.

00:20:18.470 --> 00:20:21.010
Kurt Gutenbrunner.

00:20:21.010 --> 00:20:23.020
He's got other places in the
city that are more exciting.

00:20:23.020 --> 00:20:27.240
But I love going there for this
time of year, good bib

00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:29.480
lettuce salad, pumpkin
seed oil, and the

00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:31.970
schnitzel is fantastic.

00:20:31.970 --> 00:20:34.320
I don't have a go-to
favorite right now.

00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:36.680
Perla is really good in
the West Village.

00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:38.290
I don't know.

00:20:38.290 --> 00:20:40.170
I think like most New Yorkers,
there are places I gravitate

00:20:40.170 --> 00:20:42.620
to in my neighborhood.

00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:43.600
I live in the East Village.

00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:46.560
And like I love the Red Head
for fried chicken.

00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:49.830
But I don't have an all-over
favorite restaurant.

00:20:49.830 --> 00:20:53.080
But I'm happy to audition one
and come back to you with a

00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:54.810
suggestion.

00:20:54.810 --> 00:20:55.690
Hi.

00:20:55.690 --> 00:20:56.200
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:57.210
I love your blog.

00:20:57.210 --> 00:20:58.300
I make tons of your recipes.

00:20:58.300 --> 00:20:58.380
DEB PERELMAN: Thank you.

00:20:58.380 --> 00:21:00.160
AUDIENCE: And what I love about
it is it's arranged by

00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:00.740
ingredient.

00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:02.490
So when I'm like, oh, I have
a butternut squash.

00:21:02.490 --> 00:21:03.300
What should I make?

00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:06.050
Or I have too many pears, then
I know I can go and find

00:21:06.050 --> 00:21:07.200
something to do with it.

00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:10.390
But what I found is with all
of your baked good recipes,

00:21:10.390 --> 00:21:13.250
strangely, I always have
to add more liquid.

00:21:13.250 --> 00:21:16.050
And what I'm wondering is
what am I doing wrong?

00:21:16.050 --> 00:21:18.860
Like what is going on that
this is happening?

00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:19.910
DEB PERELMAN: You mean
like shortbread?

00:21:19.910 --> 00:21:22.140
Because I mean, you should check
out the scone section

00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:24.450
where everybody complains that
everything's too sticky.

00:21:24.450 --> 00:21:28.810
So do you mean like crumbly
shortbread type stuff?

00:21:28.810 --> 00:21:31.000
AUDIENCE: So the first recipe
of yours that I made--

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:32.060
I remember this actually--

00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:35.780
it was the everyday raspberry
cake that I make

00:21:35.780 --> 00:21:37.100
all the time now.

00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:40.150
It's just like a thin
sheet cake.

00:21:40.150 --> 00:21:41.670
And you put fruit in--

00:21:41.670 --> 00:21:42.290
DEB PERELMAN: Oh, right.

00:21:42.290 --> 00:21:44.050
That came out dry?

00:21:44.050 --> 00:21:46.200
AUDIENCE: When I looked at the
batter, I was like, this is

00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:47.010
like a cookie dough.

00:21:47.010 --> 00:21:48.020
DEB PERELMAN: Oh, yeah it is.

00:21:48.020 --> 00:21:49.240
So actually those
are the best.

00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:51.226
It's actually intentionally
that way.

00:21:51.226 --> 00:21:52.160
AUDIENCE: Really?

00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:53.410
DEB PERELMAN: When
you're making--

00:21:53.410 --> 00:21:55.200
have you ever made the blueberry
muffins, too?

00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:55.870
They're so thick.

00:21:55.870 --> 00:21:56.960
It's like a cookie dough.

00:21:56.960 --> 00:21:59.990
So the trick is-- one of the
things that I read a lot in

00:21:59.990 --> 00:22:01.020
the comments is that
people hate it when

00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:02.510
fruit sinks in cakes.

00:22:02.510 --> 00:22:06.920
And actually, the trick is
to have thicker batters.

00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:09.165
People say that if you read one
of your mom's recipes, it

00:22:09.165 --> 00:22:11.550
will probably tell you to
dust the fruit in flour

00:22:11.550 --> 00:22:12.000
before it goes in.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.860
And it helps a little bit, but
actually, it's thicker batters

00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:15.860
that spread nicely.

00:22:15.860 --> 00:22:18.840
And it pulls the moisture from
the fruit as it cooks.

00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:20.240
So they're actually
intentionally--

00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:23.540
a good, thick batter, usually
works out really nicely,

00:22:23.540 --> 00:22:24.790
especially if there's
fruit in it.

00:22:24.790 --> 00:22:27.550
It bakes out to be a good,
tender consistency.

00:22:27.550 --> 00:22:27.920
AUDIENCE: I never gave
it a chance.

00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:30.520
I just added more milk because
I was like, there's no way.

00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:31.130
DEB PERELMAN: No, no, no.

00:22:31.130 --> 00:22:31.440
Bake it up.

00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:31.650
Bake it up.

00:22:31.650 --> 00:22:32.880
It's fine.

00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:33.360
That's a good one.

00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:35.490
No, it's actually like
a yellow cake.

00:22:35.490 --> 00:22:38.160
And it has this extra moisture,
which are the juices

00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:39.080
from the raspberries.

00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:40.770
So it keeps the fruit
from sinking.

00:22:40.770 --> 00:22:42.890
And it also gives it a really
nice crumb, because you have

00:22:42.890 --> 00:22:45.060
all that fresh fruit
in there that would

00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:45.790
add a lot of wetness.

00:22:45.790 --> 00:22:48.570
Otherwise, it can get
a little soggy.

00:22:48.570 --> 00:22:51.560
So actually, I like when I see
good thick cake batters that

00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:53.610
spread nicely because they
usually work out really well

00:22:53.610 --> 00:22:55.340
and have a nice crumb.

00:22:55.340 --> 00:22:56.590
But was there another one?

00:22:58.980 --> 00:22:59.780
AUDIENCE: I'm just trying
to remember--

00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:01.140
DEB PERELMAN: I'm here
to help you.

00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:01.900
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:04.280
I made your rhubarb muffins
with the crumb topping.

00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:06.530
DEB PERELMAN: Super thick, too,
especially-- and it's the

00:23:06.530 --> 00:23:07.140
same thing.

00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:10.180
It was the rhubarb, the
blueberry muffins, like all of

00:23:10.180 --> 00:23:11.690
them, the plum ones
in the book.

00:23:11.690 --> 00:23:12.630
The idea is--

00:23:12.630 --> 00:23:14.250
actually intentionally thick.

00:23:14.250 --> 00:23:16.940
But it gets the moisture from
the fruit as it bakes.

00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:18.390
And the fruit shouldn't sink.

00:23:18.390 --> 00:23:20.105
AUDIENCE: So the problem is I
just have not been having

00:23:20.105 --> 00:23:21.360
enough faith is what
you're saying.

00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:23.470
DEB PERELMAN: You
should trust me.

00:23:23.470 --> 00:23:24.930
You should have faith.

00:23:24.930 --> 00:23:27.070
Well, I mean I understand why
you wouldn't trust me not

00:23:27.070 --> 00:23:27.620
knowing me.

00:23:27.620 --> 00:23:29.365
But I can tell you that part
is, at least, intentional.

00:23:33.850 --> 00:23:36.160
AUDIENCE: I was wondering how
many times you make a recipe

00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:38.620
to consider it tested.

00:23:38.620 --> 00:23:39.740
DEB PERELMAN: Oh, I haven't
tested them.

00:23:39.740 --> 00:23:41.240
Sorry.

00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:43.860
Yeah, I have to stop
saying that.

00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:45.460
People aren't really laughing.

00:23:45.460 --> 00:23:48.700
So it can really range.

00:23:48.700 --> 00:23:51.530
If I'm starting from like-- that
raspberry cake that she

00:23:51.530 --> 00:23:53.280
mentioned is actually an
old "Gourmet" recipe.

00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:54.350
And it's fantastic.

00:23:54.350 --> 00:23:57.890
I think I made that twice
because it's a good recipe.

00:23:57.890 --> 00:23:59.340
I didn't want to change
anything.

00:23:59.340 --> 00:24:00.310
It was just really great.

00:24:00.310 --> 00:24:02.090
That would be something
I'd put on the site.

00:24:02.090 --> 00:24:04.550
For the book, I was stepping
a lot further out

00:24:04.550 --> 00:24:05.510
of my comfort zone.

00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:08.290
And so it was often things
I'd never made

00:24:08.290 --> 00:24:09.320
or never seen before.

00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:09.710
I wanted--

00:24:09.710 --> 00:24:11.700
I'm not going to ask you to buy
a book full of things that

00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:13.490
you already know how to make.

00:24:13.490 --> 00:24:18.150
So it could be anywhere from,
I would say a minimum of six

00:24:18.150 --> 00:24:20.630
times to there are
things that--

00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:23.120
I mean, the lemon bars in
there, I think I like

00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:24.060
completely went nuts.

00:24:24.060 --> 00:24:25.780
I think I made them,
like, 18 times.

00:24:25.780 --> 00:24:26.840
The fig challa--

00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:30.240
there are things where I was
really stuck on one part where

00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:32.760
I just felt like it was this
kink that wasn't ironed out.

00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:35.260
And so I didn't want to
publish it unless I

00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:36.650
was 100% about it.

00:24:36.650 --> 00:24:40.410
So it could really range.

00:24:40.410 --> 00:24:42.300
There were recipes I couldn't
even look at for, like, six

00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:45.220
months because I was so
tired of testing them.

00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:45.670
Hi.

00:24:45.670 --> 00:24:47.140
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:24:47.140 --> 00:24:51.050
So I was wondering, aside from
number of tries, what's your

00:24:51.050 --> 00:24:53.090
process of creating a recipe?

00:24:53.090 --> 00:24:56.260
Like how do you go about-- do
you look at a recipe and start

00:24:56.260 --> 00:24:56.930
to hack it?

00:24:56.930 --> 00:24:58.740
Or do you just think of
something you want, and you

00:24:58.740 --> 00:24:59.870
already know the ratio?

00:24:59.870 --> 00:25:01.850
I'm very curious.

00:25:01.850 --> 00:25:03.860
DEB PERELMAN: You know,
it really can depend.

00:25:03.860 --> 00:25:05.630
It can be--

00:25:05.630 --> 00:25:07.630
sometimes, I want to make--

00:25:07.630 --> 00:25:10.280
OK, I got this weird idea
a couple months ago.

00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:12.530
And I haven't been in my kitchen
that much since I

00:25:12.530 --> 00:25:13.270
started the book tour.

00:25:13.270 --> 00:25:14.680
So we'll get to that
in January.

00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:17.050
But I love rye bread toast
for breakfast, and I

00:25:17.050 --> 00:25:18.570
love English muffins.

00:25:18.570 --> 00:25:20.360
So I was like, I want to make
rye bread English muffins.

00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:22.160
So this is the idea
I have in my head.

00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:23.585
The first thing I would
probably do is I would

00:25:23.585 --> 00:25:24.650
probably google it.

00:25:24.650 --> 00:25:27.340
And I think what I will probably
find is that nobody

00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:30.760
has my weird taste in this,
and it doesn't exist.

00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:33.500
So from there, I've made English
muffins a few times.

00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:34.700
And I've also made rye bread.

00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:38.250
So I might take a couple of
these recipes and sort of mash

00:25:38.250 --> 00:25:39.420
them together.

00:25:39.420 --> 00:25:43.020
I actually do type up-- like
I write a recipe, including

00:25:43.020 --> 00:25:45.300
every detail that I could
possibly think

00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:46.020
that will come up.

00:25:46.020 --> 00:25:48.710
I try to get my best guess
of what I think will be a

00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:52.710
working, functioning recipe,
print it up, stick it to my

00:25:52.710 --> 00:25:53.550
fridge with a magnet.

00:25:53.550 --> 00:25:56.260
I've got a cup of pens up there,
take notes as I'm going

00:25:56.260 --> 00:25:59.220
adding adjustments or oh my god,
never make this again,

00:25:59.220 --> 00:26:01.630
with a big scribble over it.

00:26:01.630 --> 00:26:03.730
Let's say I do find that
somebody's made it.

00:26:03.730 --> 00:26:06.020
I might look at the recipe and
say, is this really what I

00:26:06.020 --> 00:26:06.610
want to make?

00:26:06.610 --> 00:26:08.040
Is this close?

00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:09.460
If it looks really close,
I might just

00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:11.140
make it word for word.

00:26:11.140 --> 00:26:14.140
And if it's exactly the same,
say hey, by the way, you

00:26:14.140 --> 00:26:16.300
should make Peter Reinhart's
rye bread English muffins.

00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:17.330
They're amazing.

00:26:17.330 --> 00:26:20.380
And if I make it, and it's
quite far off from what I

00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:22.500
wanted, that's when I'll
start tweaking.

00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:25.300
And it goes into additional
rounds.

00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:27.790
So it can depend.

00:26:27.790 --> 00:26:31.096
It depends on how obscure
it is, I guess.

00:26:31.096 --> 00:26:31.940
I hope that helps.

00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:33.280
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:33.667
DEB PERELMAN: Hi.

00:26:33.667 --> 00:26:34.830
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:26:34.830 --> 00:26:37.470
I was wondering if there was a
particular recipe, or a few

00:26:37.470 --> 00:26:39.241
recipes, that were your favorite
or that you thought

00:26:39.241 --> 00:26:40.670
were most memorable?

00:26:40.670 --> 00:26:42.830
DEB PERELMAN: In the book
or on the site?

00:26:42.830 --> 00:26:44.280
AUDIENCE: Overall.

00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:45.830
DEB PERELMAN: You mean
choose a favorite?

00:26:45.830 --> 00:26:47.810
So I tend to think of food
very seasonally.

00:26:47.810 --> 00:26:50.390
Like the things I want to cook
in December are so different

00:26:50.390 --> 00:26:51.980
from what I want to
cook in January.

00:26:51.980 --> 00:26:53.390
And so--

00:26:53.390 --> 00:26:54.680
I was like, oh, English
muffins.

00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:55.340
That's January.

00:26:55.340 --> 00:26:56.230
Don't ask me why.

00:26:56.230 --> 00:26:58.620
It's just this is how
I am in my head.

00:26:58.620 --> 00:27:00.080
When I think of a wholesome
breakfast

00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:02.040
bun, I think of January.

00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:04.940
And when I think of decadent
French toast, I think of

00:27:04.940 --> 00:27:05.620
Mother's Day.

00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:06.400
So I don't know.

00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:07.280
That's just me.

00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:10.970
So for right now, for this
month, I'm all about, as most

00:27:10.970 --> 00:27:13.070
people are, holiday cooking,
heavy roasts.

00:27:13.070 --> 00:27:16.270
I think the short ribs in the
book are so great for a good

00:27:16.270 --> 00:27:18.620
holiday party, because they
keep really well.

00:27:18.620 --> 00:27:20.960
Like you could make them a day
or two before a party.

00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:23.555
There are brown butter mashed
potatoes-- no, was that with

00:27:23.555 --> 00:27:25.220
the brown-- that has
the parsnip puree.

00:27:25.220 --> 00:27:27.400
But you can use the brown butter
mashed potatoes from

00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:28.460
the meatloaf.

00:27:28.460 --> 00:27:31.810
So I definitely think a lot
more about heavier, roasty

00:27:31.810 --> 00:27:33.710
meats this time of year.

00:27:33.710 --> 00:27:36.400
If you're a vegetarian, I highly
recommend you do not

00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:39.350
let the month go by before you
make mushroom bourguignon,

00:27:39.350 --> 00:27:41.610
because it's such a great
way to get that amazing

00:27:41.610 --> 00:27:46.640
bourguignon flavor without
having to eat beef or cook

00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:50.100
beef for several hours with
very exacting steps.

00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:51.890
And, of course, cookies.

00:27:51.890 --> 00:27:54.980
You've got to bake cookies
this time of year.

00:27:54.980 --> 00:27:58.700
I love the gooey cinnamon
squares in the book are my--

00:27:58.700 --> 00:27:59.850
like the book was done.

00:27:59.850 --> 00:28:01.690
And they were like, could
you stop adding recipes.

00:28:01.690 --> 00:28:02.790
I'm like just one more.

00:28:02.790 --> 00:28:04.890
And that was the last one
they let me sneak in.

00:28:04.890 --> 00:28:06.830
I felt it was like, we
have to put these in.

00:28:06.830 --> 00:28:08.120
And they're basically--

00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:09.210
you do it in a pan.

00:28:09.210 --> 00:28:13.200
And the bottom is a
snickerdoodle, and the top is

00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:15.460
like a layer from gooey
butter cake.

00:28:15.460 --> 00:28:16.920
It's a St. Louis thing.

00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:19.300
And the top has this cinnamon
sugar that you would normally

00:28:19.300 --> 00:28:20.710
roll the snickerdoodles in.

00:28:20.710 --> 00:28:24.770
So it's just like butter,
vanilla, cinnamon, butter,

00:28:24.770 --> 00:28:27.780
vanilla, cinnamon and then
in tiny squares.

00:28:27.780 --> 00:28:31.400
So it tastes like a toasted
marshmallow on top.

00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:33.270
OK, you guys are going
to make them, right?

00:28:33.270 --> 00:28:34.920
OK, good.

00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:35.250
Hi.

00:28:35.250 --> 00:28:35.960
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:38.190
After you've had so many
hundreds of recipes on your

00:28:38.190 --> 00:28:40.500
blog, how are you able to
come up with all new

00:28:40.500 --> 00:28:42.090
recipes for your book?

00:28:42.090 --> 00:28:44.930
And what was the time frame
like in developing those?

00:28:44.930 --> 00:28:48.110
And then also, wasn't it a
little bit heartbreaking to

00:28:48.110 --> 00:28:49.500
not be able to include some
of the ones off of

00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:52.930
your blog in the book?

00:28:52.930 --> 00:28:56.030
DEB PERELMAN: So what
was your name?

00:28:56.030 --> 00:28:56.510
AUDIENCE: Michelle.

00:28:56.510 --> 00:28:58.670
DEB PERELMAN: Hi, Michelle.

00:28:58.670 --> 00:29:02.170
OK, so the first question
was how did--

00:29:02.170 --> 00:29:03.020
so I don't know.

00:29:03.020 --> 00:29:04.610
The ideas, they just come.

00:29:04.610 --> 00:29:05.930
I don't know where
they come from.

00:29:05.930 --> 00:29:08.710
I mean, I would say that if I
wake up one day, and I don't

00:29:08.710 --> 00:29:11.680
feel like cooking anything, I
have no new ideas, it's just

00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:15.250
time to go back and revisit an
old favorite or go out and

00:29:15.250 --> 00:29:16.780
refill the proverbial well.

00:29:16.780 --> 00:29:18.440
I mean, we all hit
walls sometimes.

00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:20.550
And usually, it's just fatigue,
or you're working too

00:29:20.550 --> 00:29:22.340
hard, or you haven't taken
enough of a break.

00:29:22.340 --> 00:29:24.550
If I've actually cooked four
days in a row, I don't even

00:29:24.550 --> 00:29:25.680
want to look at a kitchen.

00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:26.770
I do not cook every day.

00:29:26.770 --> 00:29:28.420
I cook some days.

00:29:28.420 --> 00:29:30.620
I cook when I feel like it.

00:29:30.620 --> 00:29:32.770
That sounds really bratty.

00:29:32.770 --> 00:29:36.800
But especially, I mean, for non-
"dinner needs to be on

00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:39.770
the table, and we're hungry,"
it's a creative process.

00:29:39.770 --> 00:29:42.670
And so you have to sort
of not push too hard.

00:29:42.670 --> 00:29:45.530
But I actually keep a very--
this is the Google Docs--

00:29:45.530 --> 00:29:47.930
I have a very, very long list.

00:29:47.930 --> 00:29:50.020
I have a document called
Cook This.

00:29:50.020 --> 00:29:53.090
And it is pretty much every
recipe idea I've ever had,

00:29:53.090 --> 00:29:56.630
usually sorted by seasons
or months or holidays.

00:29:56.630 --> 00:30:00.240
And when I say sorted, it's
very loosely organized.

00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:02.670
But it might just be anything
from those rye English

00:30:02.670 --> 00:30:06.240
muffins, to a salad I didn't get
to, something that didn't

00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:08.710
make it into the book, things
that are partially made that

00:30:08.710 --> 00:30:12.990
might link to another document
with the full recipe in it.

00:30:12.990 --> 00:30:15.020
It's a labyrinth.

00:30:15.020 --> 00:30:17.720
So I just try to jot
things down.

00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:20.070
And I use the notes function on
my phone all the time when

00:30:20.070 --> 00:30:22.430
I'm on the road.

00:30:22.430 --> 00:30:22.690
I'm sorry.

00:30:22.690 --> 00:30:26.340
Your second question
was about--

00:30:26.340 --> 00:30:28.300
AUDIENCE: What was the time
frame like for developing

00:30:28.300 --> 00:30:28.630
everything?

00:30:28.630 --> 00:30:29.370
You said the book took
three years.

00:30:29.370 --> 00:30:33.090
DEB PERELMAN: I said it was
supposed to be six months, but

00:30:33.090 --> 00:30:34.630
don't do what I did.

00:30:34.630 --> 00:30:35.550
I missed every deadline.

00:30:35.550 --> 00:30:37.860
I think I missed, like,
two major deadlines.

00:30:37.860 --> 00:30:40.430
I was starting to get threats.

00:30:40.430 --> 00:30:41.440
I wouldn't recommend it.

00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:46.680
I'm sure that my editor has some
grey hairs because of me.

00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:48.110
I thought I could finish
it in six months.

00:30:48.110 --> 00:30:49.160
I had no idea what
I was doing.

00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:51.320
Always give yourself more
time than you need.

00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:53.410
You're not going to
be sad to have it.

00:30:53.410 --> 00:30:54.410
This is like your baby.

00:30:54.410 --> 00:30:56.870
You should do it properly.

00:30:56.870 --> 00:31:00.663
And so I ended up probably
getting it in about a year an

00:31:00.663 --> 00:31:01.910
a half late.

00:31:01.910 --> 00:31:02.990
No big deal.

00:31:02.990 --> 00:31:05.720
Year and a half or so.

00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:07.110
And sorry, you asked
one more question.

00:31:07.110 --> 00:31:08.520
And I'm not usually
this forgetful.

00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:11.200
AUDIENCE: Oh, I just asked if
there was anything from--

00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:13.890
like if it was hard for you to
not to be able to include

00:31:13.890 --> 00:31:14.490
everything from your blog.

00:31:14.490 --> 00:31:15.970
DEB PERELMAN: Sometimes
I'm like, I have

00:31:15.970 --> 00:31:16.550
something on the site.

00:31:16.550 --> 00:31:17.900
I'm like, oh, this is so good.

00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:19.380
It would've been so great
for the book.

00:31:19.380 --> 00:31:23.720
But I guess I could always
decide not this week, not next

00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:26.420
week, but maybe at some point,
I will consider writing

00:31:26.420 --> 00:31:27.040
another book.

00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:27.890
And it could fit in.

00:31:27.890 --> 00:31:32.190
Or maybe one day a best of the
site could always happen.

00:31:32.190 --> 00:31:35.320
But I don't generally feel that
by putting things on the

00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:38.630
web I'm losing out.

00:31:38.630 --> 00:31:40.950
I mean, I know that for some
people, their books are the

00:31:40.950 --> 00:31:41.970
center of their career.

00:31:41.970 --> 00:31:44.640
There are some food
personalities the show is.

00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:46.430
For me, it's really
that website.

00:31:46.430 --> 00:31:50.520
And so I never feel like I'm
giving anything away for free

00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:55.060
or missing a chance to sell it
to people or something like

00:31:55.060 --> 00:31:56.780
that, because I feel like--

00:31:56.780 --> 00:31:59.430
I mean, in general, anything on
the site is always going to

00:31:59.430 --> 00:32:00.920
get more eyeballs than a book.

00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:03.500
So I'm happy to have
things there.

00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:05.840
But maybe one day there
will be a collection.

00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:07.800
And I mean at the rate--

00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:09.110
it took me three years
to write this book.

00:32:09.110 --> 00:32:10.300
Can you imagine how
long it would take

00:32:10.300 --> 00:32:12.101
me to get that done?

00:32:12.101 --> 00:32:14.505
A decade.

00:32:14.505 --> 00:32:15.000
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:16.370
So I have two questions.

00:32:16.370 --> 00:32:19.650
The first one is, so you
mentioned in the book you've

00:32:19.650 --> 00:32:23.100
made some recipes six times
or, like, 18 times.

00:32:23.100 --> 00:32:25.890
So how do you stay motivated,
after you messed something up,

00:32:25.890 --> 00:32:26.560
to do it again?

00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:28.810
Because I find that when I try
a recipe, and it goes wrong,

00:32:28.810 --> 00:32:29.760
I'm just so deflated.

00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:31.430
I'm like, ugh, now I'm just
going to order pizza, because

00:32:31.430 --> 00:32:34.340
I don't feel like cooking
it again.

00:32:34.340 --> 00:32:36.230
DEB PERELMAN: That is exactly
what I do, by the way.

00:32:36.230 --> 00:32:38.270
I get totally pissy, and
I storm out of the

00:32:38.270 --> 00:32:39.130
kitchen in a huff.

00:32:39.130 --> 00:32:42.010
And I angry text my husband.

00:32:42.010 --> 00:32:43.980
I'm like, this is terrible.

00:32:43.980 --> 00:32:46.650
Hope you're picking up pizza
on the way home.

00:32:46.650 --> 00:32:48.340
I do not handle things well.

00:32:48.340 --> 00:32:49.890
So don't worry about it.

00:32:49.890 --> 00:32:51.698
AUDIENCE: But yet you still make
them, like, the next week

00:32:51.698 --> 00:32:51.790
or something?

00:32:51.790 --> 00:32:52.970
DEB PERELMAN: Eventually.

00:32:52.970 --> 00:32:55.020
And sometimes I don't
get back to things.

00:32:55.020 --> 00:32:58.540
It depends on if, like if I feel
like it was centrally at

00:32:58.540 --> 00:33:01.550
fault, or even it came out
correctly, but it tasted

00:33:01.550 --> 00:33:04.750
terrible, back to the
drawing board.

00:33:04.750 --> 00:33:07.855
Other times, it's just like I
need to take a break from it

00:33:07.855 --> 00:33:08.480
and come back.

00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:10.190
And I've done that a lot.

00:33:10.190 --> 00:33:12.080
There are things that never made
it into the book because

00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:14.940
I wasn't really ready to
revisit them in time.

00:33:14.940 --> 00:33:17.270
And then, actually, a lot of
them have ended up on the site

00:33:17.270 --> 00:33:18.400
since then.

00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:21.350
There are some Dijon-braised
Brussels sprouts that I was

00:33:21.350 --> 00:33:22.800
dying to put in the book.

00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:26.000
And I made them, like, 12 times,
and they were just

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:27.290
never right.

00:33:27.290 --> 00:33:30.290
And all I needed to do was just
stop working on it and

00:33:30.290 --> 00:33:33.160
take a break and come back and
be like, right, I was doing

00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:34.370
the sauce all wrong.

00:33:34.370 --> 00:33:36.270
I was making this
too complicated.

00:33:36.270 --> 00:33:37.110
And then I made them.

00:33:37.110 --> 00:33:39.650
And it was like literally one
round before I felt like they

00:33:39.650 --> 00:33:42.730
were ready for the site,
after 12 rounds of

00:33:42.730 --> 00:33:43.760
pulling my hair out.

00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:46.670
Another one is there are
strawberries and cream

00:33:46.670 --> 00:33:48.210
biscuits on the site.

00:33:48.210 --> 00:33:51.210
And for some reason, I intended
them for the book.

00:33:51.210 --> 00:33:52.870
But I was like--

00:33:52.870 --> 00:33:53.680
I don't know.

00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:54.810
They had annoyed me.

00:33:54.810 --> 00:33:56.110
I felt like they weren't
interesting.

00:33:56.110 --> 00:33:59.770
And I felt that they hinged too
strongly on having really

00:33:59.770 --> 00:34:01.600
freshly picked strawberries.

00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:04.150
And I felt like that's kind of
an unfair thing to put in a

00:34:04.150 --> 00:34:05.980
book that's supposed
to be year round.

00:34:05.980 --> 00:34:08.219
I mean obviously, fresh produce
is always best.

00:34:08.219 --> 00:34:09.690
But there's really a difference
between the

00:34:09.690 --> 00:34:11.480
strawberries that you pick and
the strawberries that you can

00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:12.960
buy in December.

00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:17.320
And I didn't want most people
to be unhappy with it.

00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:21.690
So anyway, there are a lot of
things where I don't come back

00:34:21.690 --> 00:34:23.429
to it, or I come back
to it years later.

00:34:23.429 --> 00:34:26.080
And that's where the list comes
in, because I can always

00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:28.650
revisit something when I feel
like and not feel like I have

00:34:28.650 --> 00:34:31.460
to work on that until
it's done.

00:34:31.460 --> 00:34:33.139
AUDIENCE: So my other question
is, since you've started

00:34:33.139 --> 00:34:36.060
blogging, has that kind
of ruined going out to

00:34:36.060 --> 00:34:37.190
restaurants for you?

00:34:37.190 --> 00:34:38.699
Where you go to a restaurant,
and you're like I can make

00:34:38.699 --> 00:34:39.300
this at home.

00:34:39.300 --> 00:34:41.050
Or I would change this, and
I would make this better.

00:34:41.050 --> 00:34:42.469
Do you ever think that?

00:34:42.469 --> 00:34:43.679
DEB PERELMAN: Not at
all, actually.

00:34:43.679 --> 00:34:45.820
I still love going out, because
I just like the--

00:34:45.820 --> 00:34:49.179
and I like to just turn off the
cooking brain and just get

00:34:49.179 --> 00:34:50.340
to try new flavors.

00:34:50.340 --> 00:34:52.210
I usually like picking something
very weird on the

00:34:52.210 --> 00:34:54.980
menu that doesn't sound very
good, because why would they

00:34:54.980 --> 00:34:56.389
have it on the menu unless--

00:34:56.389 --> 00:34:58.620
I mean, everybody has roast
chicken and steak on the menu.

00:34:58.620 --> 00:35:01.820
But it's when you hear, like,
turnip gratin and pasta that

00:35:01.820 --> 00:35:04.110
you're like, wow, I bet that's
good, or they wouldn't be

00:35:04.110 --> 00:35:04.800
trying to sell it.

00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:08.690
So I get a lot of ideas
from going out.

00:35:08.690 --> 00:35:10.790
OK, fine, it's kind of hard
for me to buy muffins at

00:35:10.790 --> 00:35:11.480
coffee shops.

00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:13.960
They're really terrible
for the most part.

00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:16.320
And I would say in almost
all cases, you can

00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:17.460
do better at home.

00:35:17.460 --> 00:35:18.610
There are a few exceptions.

00:35:18.610 --> 00:35:21.560
But I would say that breakfast
baked goods are hard to get

00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:23.330
excited about outside
my own kitchen.

00:35:23.330 --> 00:35:25.870
But beyond that, everything
else, I'm so happy somebody

00:35:25.870 --> 00:35:27.126
else is cooking.

00:35:27.126 --> 00:35:28.210
I'm like, thank you.

00:35:28.210 --> 00:35:30.520
Thank you so much.

00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:31.010
Hi.

00:35:31.010 --> 00:35:32.260
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:35:32.260 --> 00:35:34.380
As somebody who's been blogging
for a really long

00:35:34.380 --> 00:35:38.640
time about food, do you have any
opinions on Pinterest or

00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:41.640
how this has affected your
site or the process of

00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:44.740
figuring out stuff at all?

00:35:44.740 --> 00:35:46.080
DEB PERELMAN: That's such
a good question.

00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:49.460
Pinterest hasn't actually
changed anything for me.

00:35:49.460 --> 00:35:51.460
I think it's great.

00:35:51.460 --> 00:35:53.270
I don't use it that
much, personally.

00:35:53.270 --> 00:35:55.030
Like, I don't pin my recipes.

00:35:55.030 --> 00:35:56.280
But I make them pinnable.

00:35:59.930 --> 00:36:01.740
It hasn't really caused
any static for me.

00:36:01.740 --> 00:36:03.380
I know there are a lot of people
in the beginning who

00:36:03.380 --> 00:36:05.930
felt like there are certainly
some copyright issues.

00:36:05.930 --> 00:36:07.310
Is that what you meant?

00:36:07.310 --> 00:36:07.990
AUDIENCE: Well, there's
copyright.

00:36:07.990 --> 00:36:11.310
And did it increase your
traffic, or do you feel like--

00:36:11.310 --> 00:36:12.380
DEB PERELMAN: I think
it has, actually.

00:36:12.380 --> 00:36:15.790
I mean my general feeling
with new technology--

00:36:15.790 --> 00:36:17.000
I sound like an old fogey--

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:19.320
with new technologies that have
emerged since I started

00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:21.650
blogging is I actually like to
meet people where they are.

00:36:21.650 --> 00:36:25.520
As long as it's no real trouble
for me-- like when

00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:27.580
everybody was gravitating
towards Facebook-- god, this

00:36:27.580 --> 00:36:29.080
makes me sound like
an old blogger--

00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:30.210
I set up a Facebook page.

00:36:30.210 --> 00:36:32.290
I post a link to new
recipes there.

00:36:32.290 --> 00:36:35.080
When a lot of people wanted to
find out about new recipes

00:36:35.080 --> 00:36:36.990
through Twitter, I created
a Twitter feed that

00:36:36.990 --> 00:36:39.350
just updates recipes.

00:36:39.350 --> 00:36:41.310
AUDIENCE: Then why don't you
have a Pinterest board?

00:36:41.310 --> 00:36:42.430
DEB PERELMAN: I do have
a Pinterest--

00:36:42.430 --> 00:36:47.170
well, to me there's a totally
different process from--

00:36:47.170 --> 00:36:49.550
I kind of think Pinterest is
better when it's not just site

00:36:49.550 --> 00:36:51.130
owners pinning their
own stuff.

00:36:51.130 --> 00:36:54.800
Somebody else usually does, so
I don't usually do that.

00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:58.930
In terms of me personally using
Pinterest, like to use

00:36:58.930 --> 00:37:01.740
bookmarks, I don't know.

00:37:01.740 --> 00:37:03.260
I'm very resistant to it.

00:37:03.260 --> 00:37:04.520
I do actually have a board.

00:37:04.520 --> 00:37:06.870
For some reason, there's
this thing.

00:37:06.870 --> 00:37:11.620
This is just like a personal
thing, but I feel like I would

00:37:11.620 --> 00:37:13.910
probably just create a
collection of things that I

00:37:13.910 --> 00:37:16.440
wanted to buy and either
couldn't afford--

00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:18.490
I felt like it was sort of
unhealthy for me to just

00:37:18.490 --> 00:37:21.570
collects wants and needs
and whatever.

00:37:21.570 --> 00:37:23.760
That sounds weird.

00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:25.700
So in general, I personally--

00:37:25.700 --> 00:37:27.690
because I know I would just
pin like really expensive

00:37:27.690 --> 00:37:30.490
stuff that I don't really need
to be spending my money on.

00:37:30.490 --> 00:37:33.910
But at the same time, I love
looking at Pinterest and other

00:37:33.910 --> 00:37:35.470
people's boards for
inspiration.

00:37:35.470 --> 00:37:39.320
As an artsy fartsy person, I
love to follow design people

00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:42.990
and just see what
they're finding.

00:37:42.990 --> 00:37:44.910
But I actually think it's
been great for sites.

00:37:44.910 --> 00:37:48.195
I mean, especially with food
blogging, visual bookmarks are

00:37:48.195 --> 00:37:50.480
an important thing.

00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:52.750
And I know a lot of food
bloggers have changed the way

00:37:52.750 --> 00:37:56.560
they do their photos to have
captions on them in the photo.

00:37:56.560 --> 00:37:58.900
But I just don't want to mess
up the photos that way.

00:37:58.900 --> 00:38:01.970
So I haven't changed that.

00:38:01.970 --> 00:38:03.420
I don't want to.

00:38:03.420 --> 00:38:03.970
Hi.

00:38:03.970 --> 00:38:04.500
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:38:04.500 --> 00:38:07.940
So it sounds like you do most
of your research online.

00:38:07.940 --> 00:38:10.040
How you feel about more
traditional, like "The Joy of

00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:11.450
Cooking" or older books?

00:38:11.450 --> 00:38:12.830
What's in your library?

00:38:12.830 --> 00:38:16.050
DEB PERELMAN: I love
cookbooks.

00:38:16.050 --> 00:38:18.980
I am on the computer, so it
tends to be like the place

00:38:18.980 --> 00:38:20.340
that I look first.

00:38:20.340 --> 00:38:21.960
But it depends on what
I'm looking for.

00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:24.210
I mean, I am a huge fan of--

00:38:24.210 --> 00:38:26.410
I believe that everybody needs
"Mastering the Art of French

00:38:26.410 --> 00:38:27.770
Cooking" in their library.

00:38:27.770 --> 00:38:28.750
I have Larousse.

00:38:28.750 --> 00:38:31.880
I have "The Joy of Cooking." I
have a lot of the classics.

00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:34.140
And then I have new books
I pick up each season.

00:38:34.140 --> 00:38:35.260
So there are a whole
bunch of books I've

00:38:35.260 --> 00:38:36.230
picked up this fall.

00:38:36.230 --> 00:38:37.620
I've been spending a lot
of time in bookstores.

00:38:37.620 --> 00:38:41.290
And so every time I go,
I pick up a new book.

00:38:41.290 --> 00:38:42.680
I love using cookbooks.

00:38:42.680 --> 00:38:46.020
I almost prefer cookbooks
for reading.

00:38:46.020 --> 00:38:48.500
I feel like the recipes that
come in the kitchen with me

00:38:48.500 --> 00:38:51.860
are usually more often from a
website or something that

00:38:51.860 --> 00:38:52.980
jumped out at me from a book.

00:38:52.980 --> 00:38:57.530
But for the books, I like
to read them in bed.

00:38:57.530 --> 00:38:59.850
It's like looking at a
beautiful magazine.

00:38:59.850 --> 00:39:00.800
I wish they weren't so heavy.

00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:02.710
I'd read them on a plane.

00:39:02.710 --> 00:39:06.070
So I really love cookbooks for
reading, especially because

00:39:06.070 --> 00:39:08.680
it's more of an organized
thing.

00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:11.870
With the web, you only get
what you ask for from it,

00:39:11.870 --> 00:39:14.180
whatever it retrieves back
based on your request.

00:39:14.180 --> 00:39:16.520
But with a book, you end up--

00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:19.240
I keep thinking of this roots
book I picked up this fall.

00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:22.170
And it's like a living in a cold
climate, as most of us

00:39:22.170 --> 00:39:28.150
do, pretty much the only fresh
vegetables we have all winter

00:39:28.150 --> 00:39:30.080
from green markets are
root vegetables.

00:39:30.080 --> 00:39:31.540
And I don't really know--

00:39:31.540 --> 00:39:34.270
I have a bunch of things I like
to do with each, but this

00:39:34.270 --> 00:39:35.790
is, like, 200 recipes.

00:39:35.790 --> 00:39:37.000
And its stunning.

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:39.100
And just each page
is this new idea.

00:39:39.100 --> 00:39:41.890
So when you are at the market,
and all they have is turnips,

00:39:41.890 --> 00:39:44.600
wow, here are eight recipes
that are like really

00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:46.090
original for it.

00:39:46.090 --> 00:39:48.630
That one I've been thumbing
through when I'm supposed to

00:39:48.630 --> 00:39:51.090
be sleeping.

00:39:51.090 --> 00:39:52.490
So I really love it.

00:39:52.490 --> 00:39:55.340
And I feel like buying cookbooks
is almost like

00:39:55.340 --> 00:39:58.100
buying beloved art books,
especially with so many of

00:39:58.100 --> 00:40:00.800
them having so many beautiful
photos these days.

00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:03.290
There is a place for
all of them--

00:40:03.290 --> 00:40:05.060
well, maybe not in my apartment,
but I keep buying

00:40:05.060 --> 00:40:06.310
them anyway.

00:40:13.030 --> 00:40:13.920
Nobody with questions?

00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:15.170
Yeah, ask.

00:40:17.250 --> 00:40:19.360
AUDIENCE: So I really
like the disasters

00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:21.620
section of your blog.

00:40:21.620 --> 00:40:25.050
I think it's really funny that
you put up the recipes that

00:40:25.050 --> 00:40:25.270
totally fail.

00:40:25.270 --> 00:40:27.420
And they still have these
gorgeous pictures that look

00:40:27.420 --> 00:40:28.680
really nice.

00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:31.330
And I'm just curious, how many
things do you cook that you're

00:40:31.330 --> 00:40:34.740
like, this definitely goes
in the disaster pile?

00:40:34.740 --> 00:40:37.740
Do you do them like numerous
times and fail over and over

00:40:37.740 --> 00:40:39.440
again before they
make it there?

00:40:39.440 --> 00:40:41.830
Or how do you decide?

00:40:41.830 --> 00:40:44.100
DEB PERELMAN: So yeah, in the
early days of the site, I had

00:40:44.100 --> 00:40:47.020
this disasters category.

00:40:47.020 --> 00:40:47.860
And I used to--

00:40:47.860 --> 00:40:49.900
if I just made something that
was an utter flop, I was like

00:40:49.900 --> 00:40:52.490
Martha, I can't believe
you did this to me.

00:40:52.490 --> 00:40:53.910
This is the worst recipe ever.

00:40:53.910 --> 00:40:55.300
And it was like that.

00:40:55.300 --> 00:40:59.340
And I've stopped populating
it so much

00:40:59.340 --> 00:41:00.110
for a couple of reasons.

00:41:00.110 --> 00:41:01.800
One, people would
make it anyway.

00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:02.880
And they'd be like,
this was terrible.

00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:06.220
I'm like, I told you that,
but it doesn't matter.

00:41:06.220 --> 00:41:07.620
And I felt bad that
people were having

00:41:07.620 --> 00:41:09.010
disasters because of me.

00:41:09.010 --> 00:41:11.190
I don't want them to associate
my site with

00:41:11.190 --> 00:41:13.610
failures in their kitchen.

00:41:13.610 --> 00:41:17.920
The other part is as readership
grew, I felt a lot

00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:19.910
worse calling people
out and being mean

00:41:19.910 --> 00:41:21.240
about terrible recipes.

00:41:21.240 --> 00:41:24.270
I'll say it, but for me, I feel
like it's far more useful

00:41:24.270 --> 00:41:27.110
for me these days to make the
recipe work and say, this

00:41:27.110 --> 00:41:28.910
recipe did not work the
way it was printed.

00:41:28.910 --> 00:41:31.190
Here are a lot of changes I
made, but not just leave

00:41:31.190 --> 00:41:32.270
people at a dead end.

00:41:32.270 --> 00:41:35.760
So I don't do it as much, but
there are plenty of disasters.

00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:38.800
That does not mean that we
do not have failures.

00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:40.600
By the time they're on
the site, I've done

00:41:40.600 --> 00:41:41.470
something with them.

00:41:41.470 --> 00:41:43.473
Or I'll say, I've made
this soup, and

00:41:43.473 --> 00:41:45.150
it was utterly revolting.

00:41:45.150 --> 00:41:47.550
It was pureed spinach water.

00:41:47.550 --> 00:41:48.200
Like I did.

00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:49.550
It was really gross.

00:41:49.550 --> 00:41:51.630
Here's something that I
think is a lot better.

00:41:51.630 --> 00:41:52.950
Here's how I changed it.

00:41:52.950 --> 00:41:55.820
So I try to lead it
to a positive--

00:41:55.820 --> 00:42:00.500
like a happy ending, like a
romantic comedy at the end

00:42:00.500 --> 00:42:04.780
just so it's more useful for
people than just complaining.

00:42:04.780 --> 00:42:08.440
So yeah, but it was sort of fun
to have a collection of

00:42:08.440 --> 00:42:11.156
things that were just awful.

00:42:11.156 --> 00:42:11.500
Hi.

00:42:11.500 --> 00:42:13.980
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:42:13.980 --> 00:42:16.920
Is there any chef or cook
that you consider

00:42:16.920 --> 00:42:19.820
your culinary hero?

00:42:19.820 --> 00:42:20.290
DEB PERELMAN: Oh man.

00:42:20.290 --> 00:42:23.360
I'm not a big chef follower.

00:42:23.360 --> 00:42:26.120
One of my favorite restaurants
in New York City was--

00:42:26.120 --> 00:42:28.280
before it closed-- was Tabla.

00:42:28.280 --> 00:42:28.810
I love it.

00:42:28.810 --> 00:42:31.910
And I loved everything Floyd
Cardoz touched, I thought it

00:42:31.910 --> 00:42:32.680
was perfect.

00:42:32.680 --> 00:42:35.000
And so of course, I followed
him downtown.

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:38.180
And I've been to North End Grill
a couple times, and it's

00:42:38.180 --> 00:42:40.730
just as amazing because
I think it's the chef.

00:42:40.730 --> 00:42:43.830
I mean, he is what transforms
these ingredients in a very

00:42:43.830 --> 00:42:44.560
specific way.

00:42:44.560 --> 00:42:45.910
So that was definitely
one of my favorites.

00:42:45.910 --> 00:42:48.965
I love Michael Anthony.

00:42:48.965 --> 00:42:51.280
I think he was up at
Stone Barns before.

00:42:51.280 --> 00:42:52.790
And he's at Gramercy
Tavern now.

00:42:52.790 --> 00:42:55.390
So there are definitely some
names that have stuck out to

00:42:55.390 --> 00:42:57.150
me at restaurants where
I've had good meals.

00:42:57.150 --> 00:42:59.330
And I often realize that I ate
at their other restaurant at

00:42:59.330 --> 00:43:00.590
some point.

00:43:00.590 --> 00:43:04.080
But I do tend to follow chef
names more than I follow

00:43:04.080 --> 00:43:06.630
actual restaurant projects.

00:43:06.630 --> 00:43:08.850
It means a lot more to me to
know who's cooking there.

00:43:08.850 --> 00:43:11.350
Like I mentioned this Wallse
place, this Kurt

00:43:11.350 --> 00:43:12.230
Gutenbrunner--

00:43:12.230 --> 00:43:18.520
well, I mean his personality
aside, he makes a lot of the

00:43:18.520 --> 00:43:19.610
food that I like to eat.

00:43:19.610 --> 00:43:25.260
So I wouldn't say I have one
like David Chang level chef

00:43:25.260 --> 00:43:29.410
worship, like some name in the
stars, though you know, who

00:43:29.410 --> 00:43:31.490
doesn't like Momofuku?

00:43:31.490 --> 00:43:34.470
I live in the East Village, so
it's like Chang is all around

00:43:34.470 --> 00:43:36.470
at all times.

00:43:36.470 --> 00:43:37.720
So I don't have one.

00:43:37.720 --> 00:43:40.130
But there are definitely names
that jump out for me more that

00:43:40.130 --> 00:43:40.720
mean a lot.

00:43:40.720 --> 00:43:43.630
And of course, especially when
they've had a cookbook, like

00:43:43.630 --> 00:43:48.630
"Sunday Suppers at Lucques"
from Suzanne Goin.

00:43:48.630 --> 00:43:49.800
I always pronounce
her name wrong.

00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:52.900
She's out in LA.

00:43:52.900 --> 00:43:54.840
That cookbook is one of
my favorite cookbooks.

00:43:54.840 --> 00:43:57.060
And so then, of course, going
to the restaurant is so much

00:43:57.060 --> 00:44:00.790
more meaningful, knowing how she
speaks and talks, writes

00:44:00.790 --> 00:44:02.920
recipes in a whole collection.

00:44:02.920 --> 00:44:03.685
That was not very articulate.

00:44:03.685 --> 00:44:05.330
But yeah, there are some.

00:44:08.620 --> 00:44:10.844
Do you have a favorite chef?

00:44:10.844 --> 00:44:13.840
AUDIENCE: I am a big
fan of Alton Brown.

00:44:13.840 --> 00:44:15.150
DEB PERELMAN: Nice.

00:44:15.150 --> 00:44:17.280
For home cooking, he is it.

00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:18.800
He doesn't have restaurants,
right?

00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:20.596
He's just a home cook guy.

00:44:20.596 --> 00:44:21.450
AUDIENCE: I think so.

00:44:21.450 --> 00:44:25.340
DEB PERELMAN: He's just got
cookbooks and grape juice.

00:44:25.340 --> 00:44:26.200
But yeah, I agree.

00:44:26.200 --> 00:44:28.860
He makes amazing recipes
for home cooks.

00:44:28.860 --> 00:44:32.480
I think that he, Ina, "Cook's
Illustrated--" I mean if

00:44:32.480 --> 00:44:35.090
you're a home cook and trying to
figure out where to start,

00:44:35.090 --> 00:44:36.340
those are the places.

00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:41.110
Thank you.

00:44:41.110 --> 00:44:44.718
[APPLAUSE]
