1
00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:05.310
Okay,
let's start it up.
So,
uh,

2
00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:09.340
remember we're talking about configuration,
about handedness,

3
00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:11.140
which was introduced.

4
00:00:11.141 --> 00:00:14.590
The idea was introduced in the context of a tetrahedral carbon,

5
00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:18.970
but you don't need a tetrahedral carbon in order to have handedness.

6
00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:24.240
And an example shows is shown by the oxidation of a sulfide to a sulfoxide.

7
00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.630
So let's first talk about the mechanism.
What makes the sulfide reactive?

8
00:00:31.631 --> 00:00:34.150
In this case,
what do you see for an orbital?

9
00:00:34.151 --> 00:00:37.630
It would make the compound on the top left.
Russell.

10
00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:40.373
<v 1>Pardon me?</v>

11
00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.620
<v 0>Hi,
Homo.
The unshared pair on sulfur.
And how bout the per oxy noticed?</v>

12
00:00:45.621 --> 00:00:49.730
That's not a normal benzoic acid.
It's got two oxygens in a row.

13
00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:54.050
What reactivity does that confer on it,
Devin,
you got an idea?

14
00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:55.580
Two oxygens in a row?

15
00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:01.440
What's going to be unusual in terms of an orbital?

16
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.570
We're looking obviously for a low Lumo.

17
00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:05.173
<v 1>Okay.</v>

18
00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.630
<v 0>Yeah,
it'll have,
it has unshared pairs,
no doubt.</v>

19
00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:12.960
But we want it to react with the sulfur that has unshared pairs.

20
00:01:12.961 --> 00:01:15.300
So we're looking for a low Lumo.
Anybody got an idea?

21
00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.310
Russell Sigma Star,

22
00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.100
the oxygen's because oxygen's got a big nuclear charge,
right?

23
00:01:23.101 --> 00:01:26.670
So it's orbitals are low.
Okay.
So we have unshared pair on sulfur,

24
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.470
the Sigma Star on the oxygen,

25
00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.190
and we get one of these where we make a bond and break a bond at the same time,

26
00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.470
which puts an oxygen onto the sulfur.

27
00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.300
And notice that as you said,
Devin,

28
00:01:39.301 --> 00:01:44.250
the oxygen has um,
has unshared pairs,
the n electrons there,

29
00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:49.580
but those won't give stabilization by mixing with an unshared pair on sulfur.

30
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.860
But sulfur is in the next row of the periodic table.

31
00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.880
So it has a vacant d orbital that can overlap with that.

32
00:01:56.881 --> 00:02:01.020
So you can get part of partial stabilization there of the unshared pair on

33
00:02:01.021 --> 00:02:05.430
oxygen,
which you could denote by drawing a double bond,
right?

34
00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:10.430
So sometimes draw a double bond to sulfur and we can lose the proton from that.

35
00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:12.990
And we get what's called a sulfoxide.

36
00:02:12.991 --> 00:02:17.670
So there's the mechanism of making a sulfoxide and notice that it's not planar

37
00:02:17.671 --> 00:02:21.420
at the sulfur,
even though the sulfur has only three substituents,

38
00:02:21.421 --> 00:02:25.830
it's not planar.
So it's so it's asymmetric.
It's,
it's a,

39
00:02:25.831 --> 00:02:28.080
it's handed,
it's chiral.
Right.

40
00:02:28.081 --> 00:02:32.940
And obviously you could easily well have reacted the top unshared pair of the

41
00:02:32.941 --> 00:02:36.480
starting material as well as the bottom one.
So when you do the reaction,

42
00:02:36.481 --> 00:02:40.740
you get a Rasamayi to 50,
50 mixture of the self oxides.

43
00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.900
Okay.
Now we mentioned uh,
uh Omet Rizal last time.

44
00:02:45.901 --> 00:02:49.950
Here's the chemical structure of a map result.
What will make it reactive?

45
00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:53.460
Anybody got a hint for what might make it reactive?

46
00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:58.330
<v 1>Elizabeth Scott,</v>

47
00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:59.860
<v 0>lone pair on nitrogens,</v>

48
00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:01.690
<v 1>right?
Okay.</v>

49
00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:06.550
Now how one way to discriminate between them is to protonate one of them,

50
00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:12.220
right?
Cause when you do that,
you know,
have this carbon nitrogen double bond,

51
00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:14.110
right?

52
00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:19.110
And the Pi Star will be unusually low because of the positive charge that came

53
00:03:19.361 --> 00:03:23.350
from the Proton.
So acid is the stuff that's going to activate this.

54
00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.910
So now you've got a low Lumo and also the high homo from the other unshared pair

55
00:03:27.911 --> 00:03:29.950
on nitrogen.
So Bingo,

56
00:03:29.951 --> 00:03:33.010
you can add just as you would as the nitrogen would add to a CEO,

57
00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:35.740
double bond like that.

58
00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.760
And you get this thing with now four bonds to that central carbon protonate

59
00:03:41.861 --> 00:03:44.410
again.
And now this,

60
00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:48.160
this compound has two positive charges.

61
00:03:48.161 --> 00:03:51.850
That's not so great to have a dye cad ion.
So you get rid of it.

62
00:03:51.851 --> 00:03:54.610
You could get rid of it by losing that original Proton,

63
00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:59.860
but there's another proton you can lose just as easily in this way,

64
00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:03.160
right?

65
00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:08.160
<v 0>So lose the Proton on the nitrogen and then I have those electrons reform the</v>

66
00:04:08.291 --> 00:04:13.291
double bond to carbon and the electrons go out on sulfur and you get this thing.

67
00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.400
Now that happens.
Remember it's the acid coming along.

68
00:04:18.401 --> 00:04:23.020
The h plus is what caused this to happen to them at Rizal.
So if you have a ph,

69
00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:28.080
an acid ph between one and three omet resolve will undergo this acid catalyzed

70
00:04:28.391 --> 00:04:32.110
rearrangement with a half life of two minutes.
So in no time at all,

71
00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:37.330
it's converted to this form,
which is the active form.
Now active to what?

72
00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:38.111
Well,

73
00:04:38.111 --> 00:04:42.400
suppose you have an enzyme that has a sulfur on it that's got an unshared pair

74
00:04:42.401 --> 00:04:44.470
of electrons that will make it reactive.

75
00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.910
What will make the drug in this form reactive?
Anybody got an idea?

76
00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:52.461
Russell?

77
00:04:52.461 --> 00:04:57.461
I'm going to go to you again because you answered the same question before we

78
00:04:57.501 --> 00:05:02.060
just made this group here.
What's going to make it reactive?

79
00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:04.790
Not Pi Star.
No,

80
00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:12.140
it's the same as oboe,
right?
Sulfurs right below oxygen in it.

81
00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:16.710
So it's Sigma Star.
Oh,
you,
that's what you meant to say.
Sigma Star Essa.
Okay.

82
00:05:16.711 --> 00:05:20.520
So we got that low Lumo and the high homo on the sulfur coming in.

83
00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:24.180
So we can do exactly the same reaction before.
Right?
Make a bond break.

84
00:05:24.181 --> 00:05:27.330
A bond o h minus goes away.
Right?

85
00:05:27.331 --> 00:05:32.331
And we have this thing where we've now formed a covalent bond with the enzyme.

86
00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:36.930
So the enzyme can't do it stuff anymore.
Right?
Because it's tied up.

87
00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:42.870
Okay.
Uh,
so the pump,
the pump,

88
00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:45.570
which takes acid that's made in this,

89
00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:50.550
in the cells that line the stomach and transports the acid into the stomach

90
00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:54.240
doesn't work anymore because that enzyme is what did the trick.

91
00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:59.720
So the pump enzymes inactivated in the flow of Hcl to the stomach is stopped.

92
00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:04.900
Hey.
And in fact,
this is an interesting,
uh,

93
00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:09.500
problem in the design of the drug because,
uh,

94
00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:10.670
it's acid that,

95
00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:14.450
that causes this to happen in two minutes to become the active form.

96
00:06:14.451 --> 00:06:18.140
But you don't want it to happen until it gets into the cells that line the

97
00:06:18.141 --> 00:06:21.470
stomach.
So you'll take the pill orally,
it goes into the stomach.

98
00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:24.980
The what problem or you're suffering from when you put the one of you take this

99
00:06:24.981 --> 00:06:29.120
pill,
acid in your stomach.
So Bingo,

100
00:06:29.121 --> 00:06:32.450
it's going to happen in the stomach,
not in the cells,
in the wall of the stomach.

101
00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:36.770
So they have to coat it with something that will make it get through the stomach

102
00:06:36.771 --> 00:06:40.250
first without doing its reaction.
And so they say,

103
00:06:40.251 --> 00:06:44.480
don't grind the pill up right before you take it,
let it get through.

104
00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:46.160
Then it gets into the,
through the liver,

105
00:06:46.161 --> 00:06:50.900
into the blood stream and comes back to the wall of these cells in the stomach

106
00:06:50.901 --> 00:06:51.141
and net.

107
00:06:51.141 --> 00:06:55.880
It gets activated by acid and does this trick and stops the acid from pumping

108
00:06:55.881 --> 00:06:58.850
into the stomach.
So that's the idea.
Okay.

109
00:06:58.851 --> 00:07:03.540
Now should a chiral switch to a single lane?
Angie?

110
00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:06.650
Members.
All BRAILA SAC is Arasor made.

111
00:07:06.651 --> 00:07:10.780
It's a 50 50 mixture or the Ian and tumors enantiomers.
You remember at sulfur?

112
00:07:10.781 --> 00:07:13.850
Not at carbon.
Okay.
Now,

113
00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:16.310
if you go to a single lien anti of her,

114
00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:19.730
will the drug beat twice as good or at least better?

115
00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:23.750
Can anybody see a problem that you would have?

116
00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:28.543
<v 2>Right?</v>

117
00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:33.040
<v 0>When something interacts with an enzyme,
the enzyme is a single hand.</v>

118
00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:34.510
So the complex,

119
00:07:34.511 --> 00:07:38.890
the reacting complex between the enzyme and the stuff that you're reacting is

120
00:07:38.891 --> 00:07:43.570
dietary Americ.
If that stuff is handed,
if it's a right or left handed,

121
00:07:43.571 --> 00:07:47.860
the enzyme say is all right handed,
so you have right,
right or right left.

122
00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:50.710
One of them will be better than the other,
right?

123
00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:55.090
So is that going to be something that'll be important here if we make a single

124
00:07:55.091 --> 00:07:56.770
Ian anti more of a map result?

125
00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:59.740
Remember we talked about the lid of mid Ibuprofen before.

126
00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:02.740
We'll a single lien antibe are likely help.

127
00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:06.070
There's an interesting observation about this compound,

128
00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:10.220
the active form that makes it different from the original map result.

129
00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:11.170
Do you see what it is?

130
00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:15.710
<v 2>Okay.</v>

131
00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:18.410
<v 0>Incidentally,
notice that's the original OMAP resolve.</v>

132
00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:23.800
All of that mechanism I showed you did was the change that bond from there to

133
00:08:23.811 --> 00:08:27.350
there and the Proton from nitrogen,
the software,
let's go back again.

134
00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:30.500
That's all that happened during the activation,

135
00:08:30.501 --> 00:08:34.310
but it did something crucial with respect to stereo chemistry.

136
00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:37.190
How about that original form?
Was it Kyrell?

137
00:08:38.670 --> 00:08:42.660
Why Angela?
What made it chiral?
Yeah,

138
00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:50.450
<v 2>it's
like it's either go inside,
right?</v>

139
00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:54.600
<v 0>The bond,
the oxygen on the sulfur could be either going in or out.
It's,</v>

140
00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:58.680
it's the sulfur is pyramidal.
What happens when we activated it

141
00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:02.610
now it's not chiral anymore.

142
00:09:02.611 --> 00:09:06.150
So this thing is not going to discriminate between anything because it's not

143
00:09:06.151 --> 00:09:10.650
chiral anymore.
Okay.
So this thing is a chiral.

144
00:09:12.450 --> 00:09:12.960
Okay,

145
00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:17.700
so it shouldn't make any difference which hand you're using at this stage now.

146
00:09:17.701 --> 00:09:21.840
So there's no difference after a members all has been activated by acid notice.

147
00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:26.730
It's not activated by an enzyme.
Because if were activated by an enzyme,

148
00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:30.960
then it could discriminate between the two hands and one would be more activated

149
00:09:30.961 --> 00:09:34.980
than the other.
Right?
So that could be a difference.
But that's not true.

150
00:09:34.981 --> 00:09:38.910
It's just acid that does the activation and makes it a chiral.

151
00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:42.240
So at first glance,
one of the things that make no difference at all still,

152
00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:47.250
it could be that one in antitumor is better at getting through the digestive

153
00:09:47.251 --> 00:09:50.670
system and getting back to the stomach in order to do the trick.

154
00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:55.350
So it's still possible.
How could you tell whether it's better or not?

155
00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:59.250
This is getting pretty complicated,
right?

156
00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:02.010
All the different things that would go through to get from here to there.

157
00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:06.540
How would you find out whether it's worth using a single Ian antitumor?

158
00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:10.410
What would you do?
Test it.

159
00:10:10.411 --> 00:10:14.250
How do you do a clinical trial?
Okay,

160
00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:17.520
so you need,
but in order to do that,

161
00:10:17.521 --> 00:10:21.690
you need a single enantiomers in order to do the laboratory in the clinical

162
00:10:21.691 --> 00:10:25.110
testing.
And we're going to talk about that in just a second.
Uh,

163
00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:28.380
but first let's talk just a bit about the economics of this.

164
00:10:28.381 --> 00:10:33.381
These things called Proton pump inhibitors are the newest generation of things

165
00:10:33.631 --> 00:10:38.550
to treat acid reflux.
And here's data from the Wellmark,

166
00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:43.230
which is the Blue Cross Blue Shield of Iowa and South Dakota.

167
00:10:43.290 --> 00:10:45.390
So a pretty small population area,

168
00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:50.280
and this is how many prescriptions they wrote for four prial a sac in the period

169
00:10:50.281 --> 00:10:52.800
from 1999 to 2003 just go,

170
00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:56.520
went up by 250% to two a quarter of a million.

171
00:10:56.700 --> 00:10:57.840
And if you go worldwide,

172
00:10:57.860 --> 00:11:02.860
so 15% of the members of Wellmark get got this stuff as of 2003 and 600 million

173
00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:10.110
worldwide.
That's a big market,
right?

174
00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:14.910
So now here's cost comparison for things that treat acid stomach.

175
00:11:14.911 --> 00:11:16.720
So the first stuff is,
uh,

176
00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:21.540
is tums and Rolaids and saw those are cost three or 4 cents a piece.
Okay?

177
00:11:21.541 --> 00:11:25.380
Then there are these over the counter h two blockers,
like Zantac,

178
00:11:25.650 --> 00:11:28.290
which are now very cheap,
like 37 cents,

179
00:11:28.291 --> 00:11:32.250
but they didn't use to be because they used to be covered by patent,
right?

180
00:11:32.251 --> 00:11:36.630
And where prescription drugs.
Okay.
Then their prescription verbs versions.

181
00:11:36.631 --> 00:11:40.020
You see these h two blockers and Zantac.
One is for prescription costs,

182
00:11:40.021 --> 00:11:42.990
$4 and 27 a piece.
Okay.

183
00:11:43.170 --> 00:11:45.630
But now these proton pump inhibitors come along.

184
00:11:46.770 --> 00:11:51.770
And in 1988 [inaudible] came on the market at $4 and 61 cents of pop.

185
00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:56.410
You take one every day.
Okay.
Uh,

186
00:11:57.340 --> 00:12:00.940
but in 2002 the patent ran out.

187
00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:05.170
So now generic people started selling the generic version of a member's all for

188
00:12:05.171 --> 00:12:09.370
two 76 and astrazeneca,
the manufacturer of [inaudible] said,

189
00:12:09.371 --> 00:12:11.800
we can do better than that.
We've been making this stuff for years.

190
00:12:12.010 --> 00:12:15.850
So we'll make an OTC version and have proctor and gamble sell it.

191
00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:19.330
And so in 2003 they introduced prial Asseco,
TC,

192
00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:23.260
who exactly is exactly the same stuff,
but 79 cents a pill,
right?
Instead,

193
00:12:23.290 --> 00:12:27.550
but you can still get the prescription farm if you want the real thing for $4

194
00:12:27.551 --> 00:12:29.860
and 61 cents a pill,
okay.

195
00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:33.070
But so now you're losing a big market if,

196
00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:36.010
if your pills are costing only something like a,

197
00:12:36.011 --> 00:12:39.760
what one says one sixth or seventh of what they originally cost.

198
00:12:40.030 --> 00:12:45.030
So in 2000 Astrazeneca in introduced Nexium,

199
00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:51.130
which is a single lien antitumor.
Okay.
And now that's four 87 a pill,
right?

200
00:12:51.250 --> 00:12:55.420
And that process to go from the IRS to the s to go from the receiving to a

201
00:12:55.421 --> 00:12:56.270
single lane antitumor.

202
00:12:56.280 --> 00:13:00.100
It's called a chiral switch in the industry to go from a single,

203
00:13:00.130 --> 00:13:03.730
from a Ras animate to a single lead antitumor.
Okay.

204
00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:09.150
Now this was touted within Astrazeneca as the most successful a US launch ever.

205
00:13:10.931 --> 00:13:15.100
And here you can see the graph of how much better it is than Viagara,
Vioxx,

206
00:13:15.101 --> 00:13:19.450
Lipitor,
Celebrex,
and so on.
Over this little more than three year period,

207
00:13:19.451 --> 00:13:23.110
it went up to $8 billion in sales.
Okay.

208
00:13:23.650 --> 00:13:28.300
And you can see that there's been a lot of integration of clinical and

209
00:13:28.301 --> 00:13:32.380
commercial enterprise that at the Astrazeneca,

210
00:13:32.381 --> 00:13:36.850
this is from a website that you can see there in December,

211
00:13:36.850 --> 00:13:41.020
2003 they say the executive director and development brand leader at Astrazeneca

212
00:13:41.021 --> 00:13:45.580
adds the clinical and scientific proficiency as a research gastroenterologists,

213
00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.600
as Levine and his staff put together clinical development plans such as

214
00:13:49.601 --> 00:13:52.360
additional indications or align extensions.

215
00:13:52.361 --> 00:13:56.920
They get commercial input at every stage.
Well,
I don't know if you noticed,

216
00:13:56.921 --> 00:13:59.380
I drink water every once in a while because my mouth is dry.

217
00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:03.250
And just before that,

218
00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:06.190
when I learned that the class was going to be filmed this year,

219
00:14:06.191 --> 00:14:09.910
I realized that I'd been suffering from hoarseness since last spring.

220
00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:12.610
And I figured that wouldn't be good for the recording.

221
00:14:12.611 --> 00:14:16.600
So I went to see a doctor to find out if I could do anything about this,

222
00:14:16.601 --> 00:14:20.980
whether there was anything wrong.
Uh,
now,
uh,
there's a,

223
00:14:21.010 --> 00:14:23.620
there's something you can do for this.
And uh,

224
00:14:23.621 --> 00:14:28.600
Nexium has been the most intensively advertise stuff ever,
right?

225
00:14:28.601 --> 00:14:32.770
That was for the public.
This is for doctors.
Okay.

226
00:14:33.370 --> 00:14:34.960
So if you go to that website,

227
00:14:35.170 --> 00:14:40.170
you can see a s a seven part seven scene description of why Nexium is so much

228
00:14:42.431 --> 00:14:44.080
better than anything else.

229
00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:49.210
And what I'd like you to do for a homework problem for Wednesday is to go

230
00:14:49.211 --> 00:14:54.211
through that show and evaluate whether this series shows that Nexium is superior

231
00:14:55.251 --> 00:14:56.000
or not.

232
00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.980
Is it worth paying five times as much for a pill or six times as much for a
pill?

233
00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:06.080
Uh,
and now,
uh,
this is the,
uh,

234
00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:10.820
FDA approved label for Nexium and it,

235
00:15:10.970 --> 00:15:15.110
and so they did clinical trials just as we said they should do.
Okay.

236
00:15:15.111 --> 00:15:18.890
So here they tried to heal eeros erosive esophogitis.

237
00:15:19.370 --> 00:15:20.630
So what they tested,

238
00:15:20.631 --> 00:15:25.610
you can see is the healing rate for this condition from 40 milligrams of Nexium,

239
00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:29.840
20 milligrams of Nexium.
So that's the singly auntie in two different doses,

240
00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:33.800
doses or that traditional Ometria is all the receiving stuff.

241
00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:36.240
So these were evaluated in patients with mds,

242
00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:40.490
endoscopically diagnosed erosive esophogitis in four multicenter,

243
00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:42.680
double blind randomized studies.

244
00:15:42.681 --> 00:15:46.430
The healing rates after four and eight weeks were evaluated and shown in the

245
00:15:46.431 --> 00:15:51.080
table below.
Now suppose you were in charge of designing this test,

246
00:15:51.530 --> 00:15:56.530
how much of the Rasamayi Omet Rizal so 40 milligrams and 20 milligrams of

247
00:15:57.501 --> 00:15:59.780
Nexium,
but compared to a members all,

248
00:15:59.810 --> 00:16:04.180
how much would you have administered to compare with,
so they're,

249
00:16:04.181 --> 00:16:07.640
they're the singling Auntie,
40 milligrams or 20 milligrams.

250
00:16:07.910 --> 00:16:09.920
How much a members all would you use?

251
00:16:10.770 --> 00:16:11.603
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

252
00:16:12.750 --> 00:16:16.500
<v 0>And why
Lucas?
What do you say?</v>

253
00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:20.873
Why?

254
00:16:22.130 --> 00:16:23.600
<v 2>Between the new stuff.</v>

255
00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:29.860
<v 0>Okay.
Does everybody agree with Lucas?
Kate?</v>

256
00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:30.760
What would you choose?

257
00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:37.520
<v 2>But it looks like there's only one.</v>

258
00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:42.430
<v 0>Okay.
But if you were designing the test,
you'd do 20 and 40.</v>

259
00:16:43.750 --> 00:16:47.530
We'll have an auction here.
Do I hear 80 from anyone?
Rick

260
00:16:50.060 --> 00:16:51.430
80 and 40 why

261
00:16:51.790 --> 00:16:54.540
<v 2>that way?
So Microsoft is a recipe.</v>

262
00:16:55.090 --> 00:16:58.550
Any 40 of those we get 40 and 20th the accurate.

263
00:16:59.230 --> 00:17:01.390
<v 0>Okay.
Does everybody see what Rick saying?</v>

264
00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:05.080
If you want the same amount of what is ostensibly the active stuff,

265
00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:07.210
you should have double the amount of my map result.

266
00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:12.100
Now this is what the label says is actually used 20 milligrams.
You when Lucas.

267
00:17:13.620 --> 00:17:14.830
Okay.
Now why?

268
00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:20.160
It's because that's the approved dose for that disease by the,

269
00:17:20.531 --> 00:17:22.750
if that's what the FDA approved.
Right?

270
00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:27.960
But we'll give twice or four times as much of the what we think to be the active

271
00:17:29.111 --> 00:17:32.800
ingredient to the other people in the test.
Okay.
So that's the test.

272
00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:35.230
There were four different tests and this shows it,

273
00:17:35.470 --> 00:17:38.950
but let's summarize it with a graph that will show it,
I think more clearly.

274
00:17:39.130 --> 00:17:41.410
So after four weeks and after eight weeks,

275
00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:46.560
these are what fraction of healing there was with the Ras of mate.

276
00:17:47.170 --> 00:17:51.900
Uh,
which is shown in open figures and the shapes are different.

277
00:17:51.901 --> 00:17:52.360
Studies.

278
00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:55.860
Remember there were four different studies and this is what you get if you use

279
00:17:55.861 --> 00:18:00.060
the single Auntie enantiomers is 20 milligrams,
which remember is twice the dose.

280
00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:04.350
If the,
if that one form is active,
what would you conclude from this?

281
00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:06.230
<v 2>Okay?</v>

282
00:18:06.230 --> 00:18:11.030
<v 0>Is it worth paying seven times as much or six times as much?
Okay.</v>

283
00:18:11.150 --> 00:18:14.120
Now,
or you could use 40 milligrams.

284
00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:18.590
Now I think we would probably agree that it's better just eyeballing this thing,

285
00:18:18.591 --> 00:18:21.530
even if we aren't statisticians.
Okay?

286
00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:25.460
So four times the dose does a better job.

287
00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:27.770
Now then this was heavily advertised.

288
00:18:27.771 --> 00:18:32.450
You may have seen these things for the purple pill.
Uh,
so you get this,
uh,
this,

289
00:18:32.451 --> 00:18:36.530
uh,
gray haired guy here,
uh,
who says,

290
00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:40.580
if I told you prescription Nexium,
heels,
acid reflux damage better,

291
00:18:40.581 --> 00:18:45.020
you'd want proof and now your doctor has that proof.

292
00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:49.310
Recent medical studies prove Nexium heals better than the other leading

293
00:18:49.311 --> 00:18:52.880
prescription medicine.
Now notice he says prescription medicine.

294
00:18:53.210 --> 00:18:58.190
The OTC stuff isn't the prescription medicine.
So this is a different test.

295
00:18:58.220 --> 00:19:01.220
No wonder they call Nexium the healing purple pill.

296
00:19:01.250 --> 00:19:04.820
So call your doctor today because if left untreated,

297
00:19:04.821 --> 00:19:09.320
the damage could get worse so you can get a purple pill there.

298
00:19:09.650 --> 00:19:12.020
Okay.
This is the test he was referring to,
which can,

299
00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:17.060
which compared SMF Rizal that's Nexium to land soft Rizal.
But again,

300
00:19:17.061 --> 00:19:19.520
it's 40 milligrams versus 30 milligrams.

301
00:19:19.521 --> 00:19:22.010
I don't know anything about the land south resolve,

302
00:19:22.011 --> 00:19:23.470
but that's what they tested anyhow.

303
00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:25.640
But notice incidentally in the acknowledgements,

304
00:19:25.940 --> 00:19:30.260
this study was supported by a grant from Astrazeneca of Wayne,
Pennsylvania.

305
00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:34.370
So these are not completely disinterested people that at least some of them who

306
00:19:34.371 --> 00:19:37.100
are,
who are involved in this study.
And it says,

307
00:19:37.101 --> 00:19:41.150
so call your doctor today to learn about this.
And fortunately,
uh,

308
00:19:41.210 --> 00:19:44.000
we have my doctor here,
Dr. Duffy,

309
00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:48.380
so she's going to give you her perspective on Nexium and I'll map resolved.

310
00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:49.640
Thank you for coming.

311
00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:53.590
<v 2>That's right Ryan,
thanks for having me.
Let me just steal the microphone.</v>

312
00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:55.690
<v 0>Oh yeah,
I forgot the microphone.
Here we go.</v>

313
00:19:57.570 --> 00:20:01.020
<v 3>Well,
I can remember sitting in organic chemistry classes a premed.</v>

314
00:20:01.070 --> 00:20:05.210
I'm wondering why it was I needed to learn how to make paint.
So I,

315
00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:07.020
this is a real treat for me to be here today,

316
00:20:07.021 --> 00:20:09.720
to be able to talk to you about some critical aspects of,

317
00:20:09.770 --> 00:20:13.830
of why it's important to study and do well.
And Professor Mcbride's class.

318
00:20:14.230 --> 00:20:17.860
<v 2>Sorry.
All right.</v>

319
00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:22.470
<v 3>I'm,
so,
I'm an otolaryngologist,
seminary nose and throat physician and,
um,</v>

320
00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:26.220
and I work here at Yale.
You,
some of you may recognize me from the health plan.

321
00:20:26.250 --> 00:20:30.090
Um,
and professor McBride did give me permission today to talk a little bit about

322
00:20:30.091 --> 00:20:33.600
his case.
So I'm not going to show you any confidential pictures,
but I may,

323
00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:38.670
I may allude to him here,
uh,
in the top.
So first of all,
the disclosure,

324
00:20:38.671 --> 00:20:38.940
I'm,

325
00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:42.040
I don't have any financial interest in any of the drugs where companies disgust

326
00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:45.270
today.
I'm not on any speaker's bureau.
So in,
in,
in a word,

327
00:20:45.271 --> 00:20:48.760
I don't really have a vested interest in any,
anything shown here today,

328
00:20:48.910 --> 00:20:52.690
but I will discuss them off label or experimental uses of these compounds.

329
00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:57.460
And the opinions presented by me are mine and no one else's.
So,

330
00:20:57.461 --> 00:21:01.060
as you've heard testified here today,
professor McBride,
um,

331
00:21:01.090 --> 00:21:04.300
took pile sec and actually did improve.
Um,

332
00:21:04.301 --> 00:21:08.270
so he sent me an email and was very excited that I could come and speak you all

333
00:21:08.271 --> 00:21:11.950
to dance it by the way.
My symptoms were improved.
Um,

334
00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:16.390
so Pelisek fixes symptoms of Ge reflux disease,

335
00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:21.100
gastroesophageal reflux disease and Lorinda pharyngeal reflux disease,

336
00:21:21.101 --> 00:21:22.990
which is the entity that I treat.

337
00:21:22.991 --> 00:21:27.340
Ge Reflux disease is in the domain primarily of the gastroenterologists.

338
00:21:27.341 --> 00:21:32.140
So I'm going to refer mostly to Lpr today.
Liveringa pharyngeal reflux.

339
00:21:33.430 --> 00:21:37.090
Um,
so we've heard that process works or does it,

340
00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:40.840
we really need to know how is it,
we know these drugs work.

341
00:21:40.930 --> 00:21:43.000
Someone talked about clinical trial sedan.

342
00:21:43.001 --> 00:21:46.370
I'm going to focus a little bit more closely on that because that's,
we,

343
00:21:46.371 --> 00:21:51.070
we rely on these and they come from primarily from Pharma,
a Yale University.

344
00:21:51.130 --> 00:21:51.610
Uh,

345
00:21:51.610 --> 00:21:55.390
my clinic doesn't really have the money to run extensive clinical trials on my

346
00:21:55.391 --> 00:21:57.400
patients.
Sometimes,
um,

347
00:21:57.730 --> 00:22:01.180
some centers are able to do it or you may have a grant to do something that

348
00:22:01.181 --> 00:22:02.014
looks at a drug.

349
00:22:02.230 --> 00:22:05.530
But primarily we're relying on what the pharmaceutical companies tell us in

350
00:22:05.531 --> 00:22:09.670
terms of data.
So about private sector working in him.

351
00:22:09.671 --> 00:22:12.340
All we know is that his symptoms are improved.

352
00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:17.640
They were in his body eating his diet and living his life and taking the drug at

353
00:22:17.981 --> 00:22:19.150
the prescribed depths.

354
00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:23.110
But there are a lot of variables that we may not know about and some of these

355
00:22:23.111 --> 00:22:26.650
variables are what the Pharma companies need to take into account when they're

356
00:22:26.651 --> 00:22:29.830
doing these clinical trials when they're designing them.
Um,

357
00:22:29.860 --> 00:22:33.700
are we taking other patient variables into account?
For example,
diet?

358
00:22:33.730 --> 00:22:36.880
Does he take a large number of herbal supplements we don't know about,

359
00:22:36.881 --> 00:22:40.030
for example,
um,
this could affect the pharmacodynamics.

360
00:22:40.031 --> 00:22:43.780
It could affect the pharmaco kinetics of the drug in his body.

361
00:22:44.540 --> 00:22:48.640
Did he take the prescribed medication on an empty stomach as it's as it's

362
00:22:48.641 --> 00:22:52.480
supposed to be taken so that the acid will activate it early?
In other words,

363
00:22:52.481 --> 00:22:53.470
was he compliant?

364
00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:56.920
And these are all things that I need to be taking into account when I prescribe

365
00:22:56.921 --> 00:22:59.110
a drug to a patient.
For example,
you know,

366
00:22:59.111 --> 00:23:01.420
these studies are done in patient populations,

367
00:23:01.421 --> 00:23:04.330
but they may have been done on the west coast.
They may have been done in China.

368
00:23:04.690 --> 00:23:08.380
Is that patient population representative of my patient population.

369
00:23:09.490 --> 00:23:11.110
So when they're designing these trials,

370
00:23:11.111 --> 00:23:14.920
they try to control for as many patient individual variables as possible.

371
00:23:15.130 --> 00:23:15.701
In addition,

372
00:23:15.701 --> 00:23:20.380
these studies have to be statistically sound because biostatistics drive these

373
00:23:20.381 --> 00:23:24.280
clinical trials and they're designed so that if differences are actually

374
00:23:24.281 --> 00:23:29.070
observed between pilot sack and a and a placebo or [inaudible] sec versus these

375
00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:30.730
of members all,
um,

376
00:23:30.970 --> 00:23:34.330
we have to be able to determine with reasonable certainty if these differences

377
00:23:34.540 --> 00:23:37.480
are real or if they're due to just chance alone.

378
00:23:37.510 --> 00:23:40.940
So that's where bio statistics comes in and it's,

379
00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:44.980
I submit and I think professor McBride who helped me write some of these

380
00:23:45.530 --> 00:23:48.590
probably also feels that there is some duty on the part,

381
00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:50.750
not only of the manufacturers,

382
00:23:50.751 --> 00:23:54.500
but have a academic institutions who are also running their own clinical trials

383
00:23:54.860 --> 00:23:56.780
to actually design the studies.
So that,

384
00:23:56.900 --> 00:24:01.610
so that it's easy to understand the data are there and they're very clear so

385
00:24:01.611 --> 00:24:05.540
that they can make also very legitimate head to head marketing comparisons

386
00:24:05.541 --> 00:24:07.940
between competitor compounds.
Um,

387
00:24:07.941 --> 00:24:10.790
so I think this is very important as a physician,

388
00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:14.210
I feel that I have a duty to really evaluate the literature critically.

389
00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:16.850
Sometimes I actually need to go back and pull the studies.

390
00:24:16.851 --> 00:24:20.450
I can look at the package insert for these drugs,
but how do I know?

391
00:24:20.451 --> 00:24:23.630
How can I actually believe it?
So sometimes I actually go back and I'll,

392
00:24:23.631 --> 00:24:27.010
I'll pull the study off pub med and,
and read it.
Um,

393
00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:31.040
and we have to be able to ascertain the validity of the research that supports

394
00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:34.910
our choices as clinicians.
There's a lot of marketing out there as we heard.

395
00:24:34.911 --> 00:24:37.790
There's a lot of money to be made off these compounds.

396
00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:42.620
And I think I'm going to also propose today,
um,
that we as a society,

397
00:24:42.621 --> 00:24:45.680
we as patients,
um,
we as members of a society,

398
00:24:46.010 --> 00:24:50.420
perhaps the society who may one day have a single payer healthcare system.

399
00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:54.260
We need to be educated also.
And this information is available.

400
00:24:54.261 --> 00:24:55.400
It's available on the web.

401
00:24:55.430 --> 00:24:58.160
You've already seen some of it from professor McBride this morning,

402
00:24:58.370 --> 00:25:00.500
but this website is a fantastic resource.

403
00:25:00.501 --> 00:25:03.290
If you have a question about any medication you're taking,
um,

404
00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:05.930
you want to look at the chemical compound of it,
um,

405
00:25:06.110 --> 00:25:09.500
the chemical structure and how they designed it,
how they make it,

406
00:25:09.770 --> 00:25:12.680
how it's marketed,
how it's distributed.
Um,

407
00:25:12.681 --> 00:25:15.770
all of this is available on the website so you can just plug in the drug that

408
00:25:15.771 --> 00:25:19.010
you're taking or the drug of interest.
And that information's all there.
It's,

409
00:25:19.030 --> 00:25:22.720
it's public domain,
so I'm so use that as a resource,
but,

410
00:25:22.721 --> 00:25:27.110
but direct to patient marketing is,
is,
can be really effective.

411
00:25:27.290 --> 00:25:30.990
And this is also referred to as direct to consumer marketing.
Uh,

412
00:25:31.140 --> 00:25:32.990
you saw some of it in the earlier slides,

413
00:25:32.991 --> 00:25:36.200
but all you have to do is turn on the evening news and,
and these,
uh,

414
00:25:36.201 --> 00:25:39.140
these ads are there,
right?
Every time there's a commercial break,

415
00:25:39.141 --> 00:25:42.980
you see some happy person walking around and talking about this drug and you

416
00:25:42.981 --> 00:25:45.980
just hear the drug name.
You don't hear anything more about it.

417
00:25:45.981 --> 00:25:50.810
You may not hear anything about the studies.
Um,
but it can be very effective.

418
00:25:50.811 --> 00:25:51.860
So I think we need to,

419
00:25:51.861 --> 00:25:55.010
we need to look critically at some of the claims and we need to think,

420
00:25:55.011 --> 00:25:58.580
is this really actually the right thing for me to be taken?

421
00:25:59.660 --> 00:26:02.870
So my specialty,
so back to our clinical model,
um,

422
00:26:02.900 --> 00:26:05.140
my specialty is otolaryngology.
Um,

423
00:26:05.180 --> 00:26:09.650
I'm focusing on the larynx with Lorraine Parent Geo Reflux.
The larynx is the,

424
00:26:09.850 --> 00:26:11.360
the voice box.
It's your,

425
00:26:11.390 --> 00:26:14.990
where your vocal chords are and it's what we use when we're speaking.
Um,
ear,

426
00:26:14.991 --> 00:26:17.090
nose and throat is another name for my specialty,

427
00:26:17.270 --> 00:26:22.130
but we're talking about Lorena pharyngeal reflux,
which is reflux acid reflux.

428
00:26:22.131 --> 00:26:25.500
That primarily affects the voice box.
It's underdiagnosed,

429
00:26:25.550 --> 00:26:29.870
it's also a significant source of more ability and decreased quality of life.

430
00:26:29.871 --> 00:26:34.340
Hoarseness,
uh,
feeling like you have a frog in your throat,
sore throat,

431
00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:35.391
um,
and,

432
00:26:35.391 --> 00:26:39.860
and it's a frequently associated with other forms of reflux disease like Ge

433
00:26:39.860 --> 00:26:44.520
reflux disease,
gastroesophageal reflux disease.
So it's a public health problem.

434
00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:49.340
And,
uh,
this is a very busy slide,
but just,

435
00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:53.910
just to point out some statistics that up to 10% of patients who present to the

436
00:26:53.911 --> 00:26:58.770
ENT practice for any reason may actually have symptoms or findings related to

437
00:26:58.771 --> 00:27:00.810
Lpr living a pharyngeal reflux.

438
00:27:01.050 --> 00:27:05.850
It's also increasingly recognized as a problem that can be associated with non

439
00:27:05.851 --> 00:27:06.900
allergic asthma.

440
00:27:07.290 --> 00:27:11.970
And a great number of these patients also present with a history of acid reflux

441
00:27:11.971 --> 00:27:13.360
from other source,
from uh,

442
00:27:14.550 --> 00:27:16.920
where their symptoms are coming from other sources such as,

443
00:27:16.921 --> 00:27:20.700
such as the Esophagus for example.
So reflux is a very big problem.

444
00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:22.320
I see a lot of patients,

445
00:27:22.530 --> 00:27:26.130
it's estimated that up to 40% of the adult population in this country,

446
00:27:26.131 --> 00:27:28.830
you may have reflux and some steady state even more.

447
00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:30.990
So there's a lot of money to be made.

448
00:27:32.430 --> 00:27:35.580
What is its treatment in the year 2008.

449
00:27:35.581 --> 00:27:38.040
What we're doing is we're treating this with Proton pump inhibitors.

450
00:27:38.041 --> 00:27:40.350
But I have to also,
um,
uh,

451
00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:44.580
put in a disclaimer that there was a recent Meta analysis within the last couple

452
00:27:44.580 --> 00:27:47.450
of years looking critically at the literature and a,

453
00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:50.400
at a number of different studies that evaluated about 10 different studies.

454
00:27:50.401 --> 00:27:53.820
And there's also a significant placebo effect here.
So,

455
00:27:53.850 --> 00:27:55.530
so the jury's not completely out,

456
00:27:55.531 --> 00:27:59.520
but there are plenty of studies in my literature that support it to use for the

457
00:27:59.521 --> 00:28:03.240
treatment of Lpr.
I'm not going to go into all that today.
Um,

458
00:28:03.330 --> 00:28:07.080
but the reality is the Ppis or FDA FDA approved,
they're out there,

459
00:28:07.081 --> 00:28:08.070
they're easy to get.

460
00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:11.640
All you have to do prep practically is ask your physician for a prescription.

461
00:28:12.090 --> 00:28:16.650
So what are we trying to target?
Here is a reasonably good looking lyrics.

462
00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:19.910
So these are the vocal cords.
This is the anterior portion.

463
00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:22.650
This is the posterior portion back where your esophagus is.

464
00:28:22.890 --> 00:28:24.960
And there's left and right.
So I'm,

465
00:28:24.961 --> 00:28:26.970
this is what I see when I'm looking with a scope.

466
00:28:27.030 --> 00:28:30.270
I'd pass it very carefully through the nose and we get a very nice look at the

467
00:28:30.271 --> 00:28:34.470
larynx.
And this is a patient with moderately severe laryngeal pharyngeal reflux.

468
00:28:34.471 --> 00:28:37.950
You can see that there's a lot of swelling here compared to these other
pictures.

469
00:28:38.250 --> 00:28:42.360
This area back here is all beefed up and this area down here also looks quite

470
00:28:42.361 --> 00:28:45.990
red.
And so this is what we're treating with these proton pump inhibitors.

471
00:28:45.991 --> 00:28:49.410
And we're hoping to take a patient that looks like this and turn their larynx

472
00:28:49.411 --> 00:28:51.870
into something more that looks like this normal larynx.

473
00:28:51.871 --> 00:28:55.350
You can see the sharpen the edges here.
So,
so data's out there.

474
00:28:55.351 --> 00:28:58.590
We can follow this clinically.
And that's,
that's usually what we do.

475
00:29:00.930 --> 00:29:03.900
So now the reality when you're considering these drugs that,
uh,

476
00:29:03.930 --> 00:29:07.920
that are being developed,
uh,
as we're hearing about today and being prescribed,

477
00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:11.280
is it really only about a one in a thousand of these compounds that enter,

478
00:29:11.490 --> 00:29:15.030
enter preclinical testing?
We'll actually make it to human testing,

479
00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:17.700
what we call clinical trials.
And out of these,

480
00:29:17.701 --> 00:29:22.080
only about a fifth may actually become a be deemed safe and effective enough by

481
00:29:22.081 --> 00:29:24.510
the FDA to gain FDA approval.

482
00:29:24.690 --> 00:29:28.570
FDA approval is the holy grail.
And,
uh,
for,

483
00:29:28.580 --> 00:29:32.460
for a pharmaceutical company and interested in developing drugs and getting

484
00:29:32.461 --> 00:29:34.680
these drugs onto the market without FDA approval,

485
00:29:34.830 --> 00:29:37.020
they can't market the drug without FDA approval.

486
00:29:37.070 --> 00:29:41.140
They can't put out ads on the evening news.
So,
so this is an,
uh,

487
00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:44.020
an example of one of those documents is available on the,

488
00:29:44.021 --> 00:29:45.460
on the website that I showed you.

489
00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:49.810
And this is the approval letter for pilot tech OTC,
which came out in 2003.

490
00:29:49.810 --> 00:29:52.210
It was written to proctor and gamble by the FDA.

491
00:29:52.570 --> 00:29:54.730
And I just want to point out this area down here.

492
00:29:55.810 --> 00:30:00.810
This is an approval letter for this drug given it this dose used for this

493
00:30:01.631 --> 00:30:05.110
indication.
So the very,
very specific the drug companies can't,

494
00:30:05.111 --> 00:30:09.430
they're not allowed to market.
Uh,
it's used for other indications.

495
00:30:09.670 --> 00:30:11.650
Um,
but,
uh,
but this is really,

496
00:30:11.651 --> 00:30:15.580
really important information for the company in order to be able to put this out

497
00:30:15.581 --> 00:30:18.610
and actually start to see some return on their investment for research and

498
00:30:18.611 --> 00:30:22.480
development.
So again,
I just want to point out this is from Edwards,

499
00:30:22.540 --> 00:30:25.540
all 20 milligrams for the treatment of frequent heartburn.

500
00:30:26.350 --> 00:30:30.830
Now here's some information that you saw a different form of this earlier.
Um,

501
00:30:30.850 --> 00:30:32.380
ease mappers all also,
uh,

502
00:30:32.410 --> 00:30:36.520
has approval by the FDA for a number of different indications but also for the

503
00:30:36.521 --> 00:30:39.880
treatment of Ge reflux disease.
And,
um,

504
00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:44.740
what I want to point out here is that in the design of these clinical trials,
um,

505
00:30:44.770 --> 00:30:46.150
they look very carefully,

506
00:30:46.151 --> 00:30:50.350
strategically at how can we show that our drug is better than the competitors?

507
00:30:51.730 --> 00:30:53.680
So clinical trials when they're designing,

508
00:30:53.681 --> 00:30:57.880
these are generally broken down into three phases.
Phase one,
two,
and three.

509
00:30:59.890 --> 00:31:04.390
We have phase four,
which usually occurs after the FDA has given approval for,
uh,

510
00:31:04.420 --> 00:31:08.110
for a compound phase one that's used in healthy volunteers.

511
00:31:08.350 --> 00:31:11.230
The end point is really safety.
They want to know what are the side effects?

512
00:31:11.231 --> 00:31:15.390
Is this a drug that we can actually give to the public.
And uh,
it also,

513
00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:18.700
they also use a lot of studies to determine and metabolism and excretion of the

514
00:31:18.701 --> 00:31:22.000
drug at this point in development.
And these are usually smaller studies.

515
00:31:22.001 --> 00:31:25.240
They usually only need anywhere from 20 to a hundred patients for these.

516
00:31:25.540 --> 00:31:28.850
And then once they pass into phase one,
oh,
sorry,
let me,

517
00:31:28.870 --> 00:31:32.290
let me see a stage just a little bit about safety.
Some of the,
um,

518
00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:37.600
side effects of in,
in the industry they call these adverse events.

519
00:31:37.630 --> 00:31:40.030
This is a terminology that the FDA uses as well.

520
00:31:40.180 --> 00:31:43.360
And it really is just something to mean aside effects.
Somebody had some,

521
00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:46.750
something that was out of the ordinary and they happen to be taking the drug.

522
00:31:46.751 --> 00:31:50.500
So you have to at least consider that may have been considered by the,

523
00:31:50.560 --> 00:31:51.940
it may have been caused by the drug,

524
00:31:52.210 --> 00:31:56.350
a serious adverse event would have led to some sort of damage to the patient or

525
00:31:56.351 --> 00:32:00.210
extended care such as hospitalization or surgery.
And,

526
00:32:00.290 --> 00:32:04.900
and these aes adverse events need to be reported to the FDA during the clinical

527
00:32:04.901 --> 00:32:05.560
trials.

528
00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:09.220
So they're watched very carefully and they can't proceed through to the next

529
00:32:09.580 --> 00:32:13.270
phase of clinical studies.
If there are too many adverse events or for example,

530
00:32:13.271 --> 00:32:17.320
if they have deaths that there's usually a tend to raise really big red flags.

531
00:32:17.321 --> 00:32:20.430
And again,
all this information's available on that FDA websites.

532
00:32:20.431 --> 00:32:23.830
So if you want to see how a drug was developed and what adverse events that

533
00:32:23.831 --> 00:32:28.030
occurred during it's development,
you can see that they're,
for the most part,

534
00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:30.340
there's a lot of internal stuff that's not going to be on there.

535
00:32:30.340 --> 00:32:33.220
But for the most part,
they have to report these Aes to the,
uh,

536
00:32:33.250 --> 00:32:36.830
to the FDA as they're going along.
In phase two,
they're looking for F,
uh,

537
00:32:36.970 --> 00:32:39.260
effectiveness or efficacy.
Um,

538
00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:43.490
the preliminary data generated a generally is for effectiveness of the compound

539
00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:45.680
for a particular disease or a condition.

540
00:32:45.681 --> 00:32:49.640
So this is where we start to get into specifics about which dose of a member's

541
00:32:49.641 --> 00:32:54.230
on Megan and choose,
if I'm going to compare this to Easten that resolve,
um,

542
00:32:54.530 --> 00:32:58.400
they can compare it also to placebo.
They can compare it to a different drug.

543
00:32:58.580 --> 00:33:01.460
And again,
they're looking at adverse events.
They're looking at safety,

544
00:33:01.461 --> 00:33:04.610
but they're also starting to now look,
am I actually targeting the disease?

545
00:33:04.820 --> 00:33:09.200
The study sizes are usually bigger.
And then finally,
if it gets passed phase two,

546
00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:13.760
you can get to phase three.
And if anybody watches the stock market looking at,

547
00:33:13.790 --> 00:33:17.570
you know,
drug companies or biotech companies,
uh,

548
00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:21.110
phase three is where things really,
uh,
you'll hear about this.
You know,

549
00:33:21.111 --> 00:33:21.950
when Wall Street,

550
00:33:21.951 --> 00:33:24.980
here's a whisper that a drug's not going to make it through phase three studies

551
00:33:24.990 --> 00:33:28.970
or it may not get FDA approval.
You can tank the prices of stocks.

552
00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:33.320
It's really quite remarkable to watch as a clinician because,
um,
you know,
again,

553
00:33:33.321 --> 00:33:38.140
I don't really have any vested interest in any particular company.
Um,

554
00:33:38.180 --> 00:33:41.960
but I just find it fascinating that even just the suggestion,
uh,

555
00:33:41.961 --> 00:33:45.500
will actually impact things economically.
So,
so importantly,

556
00:33:46.280 --> 00:33:50.360
so here again,
we continue to look at safety and effectiveness.
Um,

557
00:33:50.361 --> 00:33:52.550
we may study different patient populations.

558
00:33:52.551 --> 00:33:56.300
They may look abroad to do some of these studies.
India is a,

559
00:33:56.301 --> 00:33:58.820
is a place where a lot of studies are being done these days.

560
00:33:58.821 --> 00:34:00.170
Eastern Europe as well.

561
00:34:00.410 --> 00:34:03.770
They may look at different dosages and they may combine this with other drugs.

562
00:34:03.980 --> 00:34:07.940
These are usually very large studies.
By this time they've gotten to,

563
00:34:07.941 --> 00:34:11.030
they want to see clinical differences that are so subtle that they have to have

564
00:34:11.031 --> 00:34:15.220
very large numbers of patients to make this statistically sound.
So,
um,

565
00:34:15.260 --> 00:34:18.530
they cost these studies cost millions and millions of dollars to,

566
00:34:18.740 --> 00:34:20.540
so these companies are very,
very invested.

567
00:34:20.541 --> 00:34:22.910
They want to make sure that they get return on their investment.

568
00:34:23.490 --> 00:34:28.250
And then phase four a occurs after the FDA has approved a drug.
Um,

569
00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:31.820
these are postmarketing study commitments and these are commitments by the

570
00:34:31.821 --> 00:34:32.540
sponsor,

571
00:34:32.540 --> 00:34:36.470
the person actually doing the studies and marketing the drug and selling it,

572
00:34:36.471 --> 00:34:40.290
that they will provide additional information to the FDA about the product

573
00:34:40.291 --> 00:34:43.250
safety efficacy or perhaps it's optimal use.

574
00:34:43.700 --> 00:34:47.150
And more recently we're hearing about phase zero trials in the cancer research

575
00:34:47.151 --> 00:34:52.070
literature.
My area of research is in cancer and,
and phase zero trials,

576
00:34:52.290 --> 00:34:55.130
um,
our exploratory first in human trials.

577
00:34:55.400 --> 00:34:59.030
So these are designed to speed up development of promising agents.
As we know,

578
00:34:59.031 --> 00:35:01.220
cancer is a very big problem.
In this country,

579
00:35:01.221 --> 00:35:05.600
especially with the population aging and,
and it can kill very quickly.

580
00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:07.190
So these,

581
00:35:07.190 --> 00:35:11.030
these trials are designed to establish very early on whether an agent behaves in

582
00:35:11.031 --> 00:35:14.660
human subjects differently than it was expected from the preclinical studies.

583
00:35:14.661 --> 00:35:16.040
And that does happen sometimes.

584
00:35:16.041 --> 00:35:19.820
So you can imagine if you spent months and months planning a phase one trial

585
00:35:19.910 --> 00:35:22.670
only to find out when you put it into humans that it reacts.

586
00:35:22.730 --> 00:35:26.480
It doesn't behave the way you expected based on how it looked in mice.

587
00:35:26.810 --> 00:35:29.870
You can lose a lot of money and there's a,
you lose a lot of momentum.

588
00:35:29.990 --> 00:35:34.190
So these phase zero trials are being put more and more,
uh,
into,
uh,
into play.

589
00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:36.500
So back to our clinical model.

590
00:35:37.230 --> 00:35:41.180
So some of the studies that we already heard about from professor McBride were a

591
00:35:41.190 --> 00:35:44.700
to determine whether these drugs actually worked in patients with reflux or not.

592
00:35:44.970 --> 00:35:48.000
So A,
and I'm not showing all the studies by the way,

593
00:35:48.001 --> 00:35:49.580
I just have to disclose that I,

594
00:35:49.581 --> 00:35:54.210
I'm only showing you a few studies just to demonstrate what type of data I have

595
00:35:54.211 --> 00:35:57.810
to actually take into consideration as a clinician when I'm looking critically

596
00:35:57.811 --> 00:35:59.100
at how the studies were done,

597
00:35:59.340 --> 00:36:04.170
whether I think the drugs actually gonna be helpful for my patient or not.
So,

598
00:36:04.190 --> 00:36:06.180
um,
this was in a,
in a group of patients,

599
00:36:06.181 --> 00:36:09.930
that particular patient population with their already established erosive

600
00:36:09.931 --> 00:36:14.910
esophogitis sounds pretty bad.
It's pretty uncomfortable.
Um,

601
00:36:14.930 --> 00:36:15.540
and they,

602
00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:19.440
they studied these patients with ease and Metrosol Ana members all at at similar

603
00:36:19.441 --> 00:36:21.840
doses with similar numbers of patients in both arms.

604
00:36:22.110 --> 00:36:25.790
They found no statistically significant difference in the,
uh,

605
00:36:26.130 --> 00:36:30.840
in the symptoms of heartburn sustained resolution of heartburn symptoms in this

606
00:36:30.841 --> 00:36:35.520
group of patients.
Now if you read the ease of members all package insert,

607
00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:40.020
they state that they chose a members all 20 as the competitor dose because it's

608
00:36:40.021 --> 00:36:42.780
the FDA approved dose for this indication,
which it is.

609
00:36:43.170 --> 00:36:46.830
So that went to the [inaudible] package insert defined that they did look at 40

610
00:36:46.831 --> 00:36:49.710
milligrams when they were looking at these types of symptoms.

611
00:36:50.070 --> 00:36:53.880
They found that there was really no improve and no benefit to using the higher

612
00:36:53.881 --> 00:36:58.020
devs.
So they went with the lower dose when they went for FDA approval.

613
00:36:58.021 --> 00:37:00.870
So that's I think partly why they chose 20 milligrams.

614
00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:03.360
And then also if you look more closely,

615
00:37:03.361 --> 00:37:08.361
there's also they lose some linearity between plasma concentration versus area

616
00:37:09.061 --> 00:37:12.600
under the curve,
which is plasma concentration in the patient over time.

617
00:37:12.900 --> 00:37:16.110
So it becomes less and less predictable as you go up on the dose.

618
00:37:16.470 --> 00:37:21.230
How much drug is actually being seen physiologically for the patient.
Um,
so,

619
00:37:21.231 --> 00:37:24.480
so once they get out of that predictable linearity,
um,

620
00:37:24.510 --> 00:37:25.950
things become a little bit iffy in,

621
00:37:25.951 --> 00:37:27.990
you could potentially get into adverse effects.

622
00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:32.550
So I think that's part of the logic for why they chose that.
But you know,
again,

623
00:37:32.551 --> 00:37:35.910
I'm not trying to make a,
an exhaustive argument for which,

624
00:37:35.911 --> 00:37:38.580
what should have been done or what,
you know,
against what was done.

625
00:37:38.820 --> 00:37:42.750
Just to give you some idea for what we have to deal with,
uh,
as clinicians.

626
00:37:43.110 --> 00:37:44.580
So then finally,
these are the,

627
00:37:44.610 --> 00:37:47.820
some of the three studies that professor McBride has already alluded to showing

628
00:37:47.821 --> 00:37:50.460
that there are variable results.
This one,

629
00:37:50.461 --> 00:37:54.570
she had a definite statistically significant improvement in healing and

630
00:37:54.571 --> 00:37:59.250
regressive esophogitis for Isa mappers all over any to over any dose of visa

631
00:37:59.251 --> 00:38:01.320
members all over the map result.
Um,

632
00:38:01.350 --> 00:38:03.930
but two other studies actually said that there was no difference.

633
00:38:05.010 --> 00:38:09.660
So there's another bigger study as well that's not included here for the next,

634
00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:14.540
oh,
I'm sorry.
Yeah,
there it is.
Okay.
Yeah.
So,
so yeah,
you know,

635
00:38:14.541 --> 00:38:18.540
you just kind of have to look at the literature and say,
okay,
I'm convinced.

636
00:38:18.541 --> 00:38:21.360
I'm not convinced.
Um,
I don't know that there's any right or wrong,

637
00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:24.750
but the FDA also has a role to play here and they,
they,
um,

638
00:38:25.400 --> 00:38:28.950
they really vet these studies quite well and they're not allowed to market if

639
00:38:28.951 --> 00:38:30.420
they don't feel that if they have,

640
00:38:30.450 --> 00:38:33.630
FDA doesn't feel that there's sufficient evidence there to support it.

641
00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:39.070
So in,
in my patient population who have,
uh,
Lpr,

642
00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:42.070
a large number of these patients have,
uh,
have heartburn.

643
00:38:42.280 --> 00:38:44.350
They may or may not be treated for the heartburn already.

644
00:38:44.351 --> 00:38:47.860
I may be the first physician they see.
And,
and I may say,
well,

645
00:38:47.861 --> 00:38:50.550
do you also have heartburn symptoms?
You know,
that would,

646
00:38:50.590 --> 00:38:52.870
those would be GE reflux type of symptoms.

647
00:38:53.260 --> 00:38:58.000
So I can end up treating both of those if I put my patient on one of these PPIs

648
00:38:58.001 --> 00:38:59.830
for Lorena pharyngeal reflux.

649
00:39:00.370 --> 00:39:04.630
So if I've just told you that these drugs are approved for a specific
indication,

650
00:39:04.780 --> 00:39:07.870
maybe at a specific dose,
um,
how has it,

651
00:39:07.871 --> 00:39:10.870
I'm able to use it for something that's not really even approved for.

652
00:39:11.380 --> 00:39:14.080
And this is where we get into off label use of drugs.

653
00:39:14.290 --> 00:39:17.620
So once a drug is approved by the FDA for any indication,

654
00:39:17.621 --> 00:39:21.760
I as a clinician can write it as a prescription for another indication.

655
00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:22.750
Um,

656
00:39:22.750 --> 00:39:27.730
but the FDA has put out these guidelines such that good medical practice in the

657
00:39:27.731 --> 00:39:31.480
best interest of the patients should prevail here so that we're using legally

658
00:39:31.481 --> 00:39:36.120
available drugs.
It's an important term according to the apps.
And devices.
Um,

659
00:39:36.160 --> 00:39:39.010
according to my best knowledge and judgement as a clinician,

660
00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:42.970
if we use a product for an indication that's not in the approved labeling,

661
00:39:43.150 --> 00:39:44.790
I have the responsibility to be willing,

662
00:39:44.791 --> 00:39:49.060
informed about the product to basis use on from scientific rationale and on

663
00:39:49.061 --> 00:39:51.370
sound medical evidence.
Now in my literature,

664
00:39:51.371 --> 00:39:55.810
there's a lot of sound medical evidence supporting the use for Ppis in Loring a

665
00:39:55.811 --> 00:39:59.190
pharyngeal reflux.
But I just also,
yeah,

666
00:39:59.370 --> 00:40:02.360
<v 1>but you say that you haven't responded,
it's not underlined there.</v>

667
00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:06.230
Say there's a responsibility to maintain records of the products use to the

668
00:40:06.280 --> 00:40:09.620
fence cause anyone come around and collect those records?

669
00:40:09.621 --> 00:40:10.910
I try to make something of them.

670
00:40:11.130 --> 00:40:13.290
<v 3>I've never been contacted by anybody.</v>

671
00:40:13.850 --> 00:40:17.230
<v 1>Um,
our,
our people pretty conscientious about doing that.</v>

672
00:40:17.780 --> 00:40:20.300
<v 3>I think that we're conscientious about die about.</v>

673
00:40:20.301 --> 00:40:24.110
I'm recording whether there've been side effects,
um,
you know,

674
00:40:24.111 --> 00:40:27.560
at the given dose we were conscientious about recording whether there's been

675
00:40:27.561 --> 00:40:31.280
improvement in the symptoms.
Um,
but you know,
I don't,

676
00:40:31.310 --> 00:40:34.100
I don't have a detailed questionnaire in general.
So yeah,

677
00:40:34.650 --> 00:40:38.050
<v 1>take it as one would think that this could be sort of like a wiki that,</v>

678
00:40:38.310 --> 00:40:41.340
that even though you can't afford to do a big study,

679
00:40:41.341 --> 00:40:46.110
that if you can collect enough observations,
you could make something out of it.

680
00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:50.860
<v 3>We could,
we could,
but then you're into experimenting,
uh,
on,
you know,</v>

681
00:40:50.861 --> 00:40:51.970
if you're doing it with,

682
00:40:52.120 --> 00:40:57.030
with the intention of actually showing or disproving a hypothesis really to

683
00:40:57.110 --> 00:41:01.540
maintain.
We do at new,
I agree with that.
I agree,
but,
but we're not really,

684
00:41:01.541 --> 00:41:04.210
we're not really obligated to submit to an IRB.
If we were,

685
00:41:04.211 --> 00:41:07.750
if we were doing it with the intention of definitely showing a difference one

686
00:41:07.751 --> 00:41:10.510
way or another,
then you then that would be considered an experiment.

687
00:41:10.511 --> 00:41:14.260
So I would be obligated to run that through the Institutional Review Board,

688
00:41:14.261 --> 00:41:18.130
which is there for the protection of human subjects and make sure that any

689
00:41:18.131 --> 00:41:21.910
studies that we're designing are,
are legitimate,
that are ethical,

690
00:41:22.120 --> 00:41:26.320
that the patient has been given the opportunity to ask questions they can

691
00:41:26.500 --> 00:41:28.930
refuse,
they can drop out of a study.
So,

692
00:41:28.931 --> 00:41:32.230
but they're all important issues that I think would be in the realm of,
you know,

693
00:41:32.231 --> 00:41:36.900
at that point actual experimentation.
But it's a really important,
uh,

694
00:41:36.980 --> 00:41:38.180
it's an important point,

695
00:41:39.100 --> 00:41:41.890
but we can't use these drugs for off label marketing uses.

696
00:41:42.100 --> 00:41:45.280
Now the drug companies importantly are not allowed to market.

697
00:41:45.281 --> 00:41:49.180
They're not allowed to advertise for off label uses of compounds.

698
00:41:50.840 --> 00:41:51.310
<v 2>Okay.</v>

699
00:41:51.310 --> 00:41:53.080
<v 3>So again,
I have a duty as a physician,</v>

700
00:41:53.081 --> 00:41:56.680
do you evaluate this literature critically and really be able to validate or

701
00:41:57.010 --> 00:42:01.390
ascertain the validity of the research that supports my choices?

702
00:42:01.630 --> 00:42:04.570
So just a very quick word about marketing.
Um,
as I mentioned,

703
00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:06.100
my research areas in oncology,

704
00:42:06.101 --> 00:42:09.880
I've been involved in some clinical trials with oncologic drugs for head and

705
00:42:09.881 --> 00:42:11.200
neck cancer.
Um,

706
00:42:11.260 --> 00:42:15.880
and I get these emails all the time at marketing is really big deal when it

707
00:42:15.881 --> 00:42:19.410
comes to these compounds.
Um,
and just to give you an idea,

708
00:42:19.450 --> 00:42:21.340
this one in particular is about,
you know,

709
00:42:21.341 --> 00:42:25.300
how do you market your oncology strategy,
your oncology products?

710
00:42:25.301 --> 00:42:29.770
And this is an actual meeting that too,
which I was invited.
And you know,

711
00:42:29.771 --> 00:42:33.070
one of the teasers here is that in such a crowded and competitive market,

712
00:42:33.310 --> 00:42:34.660
the ability to differentiate,

713
00:42:34.810 --> 00:42:37.330
differentiate your product has never been more important.

714
00:42:37.540 --> 00:42:39.880
So this just gives you some idea of,
you know,

715
00:42:39.881 --> 00:42:44.070
what the thought process is and what the general culture is.
Um,
and,

716
00:42:44.071 --> 00:42:46.990
and this is again a wordy slide,
but just to point out,

717
00:42:46.991 --> 00:42:49.300
and this comes from nature news,
it's fairly recent.

718
00:42:49.570 --> 00:42:53.500
That industry is really starting to shift attention now to other areas.

719
00:42:53.590 --> 00:42:55.510
So cardiovascular drugs,

720
00:42:55.511 --> 00:42:59.770
which cardiovascular disease is really the foremost killer,
um,
in,

721
00:42:59.860 --> 00:43:01.240
in our country right now,

722
00:43:01.420 --> 00:43:05.020
but they're really shifting their attention now to two drugs with perhaps they

723
00:43:05.021 --> 00:43:09.000
can make,
you know,
another blockbuster drug.
And that's,
that's usually always,
uh,

724
00:43:09.001 --> 00:43:13.780
what the impetus is return on investment.
So oncology,
drugs,
immunology,

725
00:43:13.950 --> 00:43:17.230
uh,
which you know,
would be something from rheumatoid arthritis for example,

726
00:43:17.350 --> 00:43:19.030
and neurology are going to be very,

727
00:43:19.031 --> 00:43:22.210
very big focus of attention of Pharma industry.

728
00:43:22.211 --> 00:43:26.500
So as you watch the evening news or whichever channel you might be tuning into,

729
00:43:26.530 --> 00:43:29.440
um,
you will be hearing a lot more about this and all that.

730
00:43:29.441 --> 00:43:34.300
I think a lot more directive to patient marketing is going to take place.
So,
um,

731
00:43:34.660 --> 00:43:37.570
again,
this has been a lot of fun for me to participate in that.
And I,

732
00:43:37.650 --> 00:43:41.560
I thank professor McBride also for stimulating me to think a little bit more

733
00:43:41.561 --> 00:43:44.320
deeply about Proton pump inhibitors and how is

734
00:43:44.870 --> 00:43:49.870
<v 2>okay [inaudible]</v>

735
00:43:54.690 --> 00:43:57.960
<v 3>I'd be happy to try to field any questions as long as they're not too hard.</v>

736
00:43:59.220 --> 00:44:01.380
<v 2>Yeah.
Yep.</v>

737
00:44:14.300 --> 00:44:15.170
Side of things.

738
00:44:20.390 --> 00:44:24.140
<v 3>Right.
So the question is,
um,
from you said you're an international student,</v>

739
00:44:25.820 --> 00:44:29.120
right?
So,
so she's noted when,
when these,

740
00:44:29.420 --> 00:44:33.270
when these ads come on TV that there's a very long disclaimer afterwards about

741
00:44:33.271 --> 00:44:34.990
the side effects and,
and two,

742
00:44:35.040 --> 00:44:39.360
I'm not actually an expert on how the marketing of these drugs is done.
Um,

743
00:44:39.390 --> 00:44:43.170
I'm going to speculate here,
but I'm pretty confident that this is a correct,

744
00:44:43.171 --> 00:44:45.900
that the FDA mandates that they put that out there.

745
00:44:45.901 --> 00:44:50.340
So if you're gonna make a claim about a,
a compound and how great it is,

746
00:44:50.880 --> 00:44:54.420
you also better tell the other side of the story.
You better tell them,
listen,

747
00:44:54.421 --> 00:44:57.420
we might fix your reflux,
but you're going to get diarrhea.
You know,
and,

748
00:44:57.421 --> 00:45:01.200
and it's kind of funny actually,
cause if you,
if you look at these,
you say,
okay,

749
00:45:01.201 --> 00:45:04.020
I'm going to take that drug to get it fixed,
my runny nose,

750
00:45:04.290 --> 00:45:07.620
but I'm going to get diarrhea and muscle pains and all these other things.
So,

751
00:45:07.790 --> 00:45:12.660
you know,
it really,
I think the,
it's probably mandated by the FDA.
Um,
and the,

752
00:45:12.690 --> 00:45:17.020
and the FCC also,
um,
may have something to do with that,
but,
um,

753
00:45:17.310 --> 00:45:18.780
that would be my speculation.

754
00:45:20.780 --> 00:45:21.613
<v 2>Yes.</v>

755
00:45:32.620 --> 00:45:33.453
Studies.

756
00:45:43.070 --> 00:45:43.903
Yeah.

757
00:45:45.320 --> 00:45:48.290
<v 3>Right.
And then we wonder as consumers,
is this safe?</v>

758
00:45:48.291 --> 00:45:51.530
If I'm going to keep taking this drug for years and years,
am I say if we're,
um,

759
00:45:51.560 --> 00:45:55.310
you know,
or my progeny going to be safe.
It's a good question.
Um,
and,

760
00:45:55.340 --> 00:45:57.320
and that's where some of these phase four studies,

761
00:45:57.321 --> 00:45:59.830
they're called postmarketing studies come in.
Um,

762
00:45:59.831 --> 00:46:03.500
I was involved with one clinical trial where a phase four study actually was

763
00:46:03.501 --> 00:46:06.620
mandated.
Um,
and so for years afterwards,

764
00:46:06.800 --> 00:46:11.750
that drug company had to continue to pour resources into contacting patients who

765
00:46:11.751 --> 00:46:14.720
had taken the drug.
Are you still taking?
And if you're still taking it,

766
00:46:14.721 --> 00:46:17.090
what side effects are you having?
So,

767
00:46:17.091 --> 00:46:21.950
so those are mandated on some level and the FDA really plays the key role there.

768
00:46:22.670 --> 00:46:26.240
And,
um,
that's been my experience,
but,

769
00:46:26.241 --> 00:46:30.620
but it definitely raises questions and the Vioxx trials just was devastating for

770
00:46:30.621 --> 00:46:34.520
Merck.
Um,
and I think a lot,
you know,
they didn't see a lot of that coming.
So,
um,

771
00:46:34.760 --> 00:46:37.250
I think for the Pharma companies,
correct me if I'm wrong,

772
00:46:37.251 --> 00:46:39.370
you may have more insights.
It's probably a,

773
00:46:39.371 --> 00:46:41.450
it's a decision that they have to wait,
you know,

774
00:46:41.630 --> 00:46:45.500
how much resources are they going to continue to pour in?
Um,
and that would,

775
00:46:45.650 --> 00:46:48.080
you know,
on paper it would take away from their profits.

776
00:46:48.081 --> 00:46:52.310
So I'm sure there's a lot of internal debate about it.
Um,

777
00:46:52.700 --> 00:46:54.800
but yeah,
that's,
that's where it was.
You know,

778
00:46:54.880 --> 00:46:58.640
we're thankful that we have the FDA looking at a lot of countries don't have an

779
00:46:58.641 --> 00:47:00.110
organization such as the FDA.

780
00:47:00.111 --> 00:47:04.220
You can market anything you want for almost any indication and whatever does is

781
00:47:04.221 --> 00:47:07.760
goes.
So,
you know,
we're,
I think we're very fortunate in that respect.

782
00:47:09.050 --> 00:47:12.170
I'm going to turn the mic over.
Oh,
sorry,
I'm sorry.

783
00:47:14.310 --> 00:47:15.143
<v 2>Cases</v>

784
00:47:16.490 --> 00:47:21.490
use it is actually for something that has a bigger patient population so you can

785
00:47:24.951 --> 00:47:28.790
potentially make more money.
Also believes this can be advertised.

786
00:47:28.791 --> 00:47:30.720
How do this doctors find out?

787
00:47:31.660 --> 00:47:35.080
<v 3>Say the question is if,
if an off label use,</v>

788
00:47:35.110 --> 00:47:39.850
if if an off label use for a drug can't be advertised with a company,
how do I,

789
00:47:39.851 --> 00:47:42.220
how do I as a physician here about it?
Um,

790
00:47:42.310 --> 00:47:46.990
I would hear about it from other clinical trials that were done mid,
maybe have,

791
00:47:47.020 --> 00:47:50.770
may have been supported by the company.
So,
um,

792
00:47:51.670 --> 00:47:54.770
as we saw an example of earlier,
but um,
I look for a,

793
00:47:54.790 --> 00:47:56.230
for literature within my field,

794
00:47:56.231 --> 00:47:59.110
so for luring a pharyngeal reflux is a perfect example of that.

795
00:47:59.410 --> 00:48:01.570
It works pretty well for this drug,

796
00:48:01.571 --> 00:48:04.360
but you do have to take it for a longer time period and sometimes you actually

797
00:48:04.361 --> 00:48:08.330
have to take it for higher doses than is recommended for GE reflux alone.
Um,

798
00:48:08.640 --> 00:48:12.310
but it works pretty well.
And I hear patients all the time say that it works.

799
00:48:12.850 --> 00:48:17.620
It works.
I have other patients who say it doesn't work.
Um,
so,
so yeah,
we,

800
00:48:17.680 --> 00:48:21.220
I mean we,
we just have to look at our own literature.
There are smaller studies.

801
00:48:21.221 --> 00:48:24.960
They may have 50,
70 patients.
Um,
but you know,
an,

802
00:48:25.220 --> 00:48:26.710
an academic institution,

803
00:48:26.711 --> 00:48:30.790
somebody who with an interest in that particular area may run their own steady

804
00:48:30.791 --> 00:48:34.840
because they want that information.
The information's not out there.
So,
so we,

805
00:48:34.841 --> 00:48:38.800
we look for,
we look for good solid data to help guide our choices that way.

806
00:48:41.490 --> 00:48:46.470
<v 2>Huh?
[inaudible]</v>

807
00:48:48.790 --> 00:48:53.280
use [inaudible] there side effects.

808
00:48:56.040 --> 00:48:59.250
<v 3>Uh,
okay.
I'll give you,
oh,
how?
Yeah,
there was.</v>

809
00:48:59.970 --> 00:49:04.200
So when I,
I don't,
I don't really have any drugs I can use that for.

810
00:49:04.500 --> 00:49:09.420
Um,
but there's one,
there's one drug in my field.
Um,

811
00:49:09.450 --> 00:49:14.100
botox for example,
botox was being used,
uh,
to help,

812
00:49:14.930 --> 00:49:18.250
uh,
weaken the vocal cords.
Okay.
Uh,

813
00:49:18.300 --> 00:49:22.650
it's been used for that for years and patients who have speech problems,

814
00:49:23.010 --> 00:49:26.550
um,
and don't have good control over their vocal cords and the function.

815
00:49:26.551 --> 00:49:28.590
So you can,
you can use botox injections.

816
00:49:28.591 --> 00:49:33.120
Then botox injections came along for use in the face.
And you know,

817
00:49:33.121 --> 00:49:38.020
you read about this on page six all the time.
It's hilarious.
But,
um,
but,

818
00:49:38.021 --> 00:49:40.650
but,
but what they've also noticed,
um,

819
00:49:41.220 --> 00:49:45.210
was that migraine headaches got a lot better.
So you can use that.

820
00:49:45.300 --> 00:49:47.580
You can use botox to treat migraine headaches.

821
00:49:47.581 --> 00:49:51.570
And there are actually our phase three trials going on right now by a colleague

822
00:49:51.571 --> 00:49:56.340
of mine down in Manhattan,
um,
looking at exactly that question.
Um,

823
00:49:56.341 --> 00:49:58.710
so yeah,
you can use them,
uh,
for,

824
00:49:58.830 --> 00:50:01.950
you can take advantage of some of these side effects.
Um,

825
00:50:02.280 --> 00:50:05.940
but I don't know of any specific negative side effects,
uh,
that were used,

826
00:50:05.941 --> 00:50:06.890
but that just happened to you.

827
00:50:06.891 --> 00:50:10.860
You may see some beneficial positive side effects that the Pharma companies

828
00:50:10.861 --> 00:50:14.250
didn't even know existed.
You know,
they didn't even target that.
So,
so,

829
00:50:14.251 --> 00:50:17.550
so we continued it.
So that's where it's important to do clinical trials as a,

830
00:50:17.610 --> 00:50:19.900
as a clinician.
So I'm involved in clinical trials as well,

831
00:50:19.901 --> 00:50:23.190
and that's sort of an ongoing duty,
I think.
Um,
you know,

832
00:50:23.220 --> 00:50:28.010
certainly being an academic institution that we need to also an important role.

833
00:50:29.370 --> 00:50:33.520
<v 4>Okay,
thanks.
So if you have a few more questions,
come on up.
Yeah,</v>

834
00:50:33.530 --> 00:50:35.450
I'm sure you have to get back to your practice,

835
00:50:35.540 --> 00:50:38.510
but the time's up now and thanks again,
Dr. Duffy.

836
00:50:38.530 --> 00:50:42.260
[inaudible].
