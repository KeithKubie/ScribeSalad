was not the tanks and the soldiers that
came from United States it was the fact

00:08:52.690 --> 00:08:52.700
came from United States it was the fact
 

00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:54.850
came from United States it was the fact
that United States used

00:08:54.850 --> 00:08:54.860
that United States used
 

00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:57.730
that United States used
biological warfare to finish World War

00:08:57.730 --> 00:08:57.740
biological warfare to finish World War
 

00:08:57.740 --> 00:09:03.389

one and that is probably the case the

00:09:03.389 --> 00:09:03.399
one and that is probably the case the
 

00:09:03.399 --> 00:09:07.690

American dough boys took h1n1 from the

00:09:07.690 --> 00:09:07.700
American dough boys took h1n1 from the
 

00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:11.949
American dough boys took h1n1 from the
United States to France and in the

00:09:11.949 --> 00:09:11.959
United States to France and in the
 

00:09:11.959 --> 00:09:14.470
United States to France and in the
trenches were so close that it blew over

00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:14.480
trenches were so close that it blew over
 

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:18.430
trenches were so close that it blew over
and really that was what finished World

00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:18.440
and really that was what finished World
 

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:22.509
and really that was what finished World

thus far as that could contrast' back

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:28.250
thus far as that could contrast' back

this virus did come from United States

00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:30.760
this virus did come from United States

this virus did come from United States
the young soldiers were it showed up at

00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:34.990
the young soldiers were it showed up at
 

00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:40.480
the young soldiers were it showed up at
Fort Funston in Kansas and so why was it

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:40.490
Fort Funston in Kansas and so why was it
 

00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:43.019
Fort Funston in Kansas and so why was it
called Spanish if it came from there

00:09:43.019 --> 00:09:43.029
called Spanish if it came from there
 

00:09:43.029 --> 00:09:49.240
called Spanish if it came from there
because both sides in the war didn't

because both sides in the war didn't
 

00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:50.920
because both sides in the war didn't
want to acknowledge that the virus was

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:50.930
want to acknowledge that the virus was
 

00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:53.530
want to acknowledge that the virus was
present and they'd been outbreaks in

00:09:53.530 --> 00:09:53.540
present and they'd been outbreaks in
 

00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:56.889
present and they'd been outbreaks in
Spain so they called it Spanish flu so

00:09:56.889 --> 00:09:56.899
Spain so they called it Spanish flu so
 

00:09:56.899 --> 00:10:00.400
Spain so they called it Spanish flu so
it wasn't British flu or American flu it

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:00.410
it wasn't British flu or American flu it
 

00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:07.240
it wasn't British flu or American flu it
was Spanish flu next one and the the

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:07.250
was Spanish flu next one and the the
 

00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:10.180
was Spanish flu next one and the the
doughboys that were put onto ships and

00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:10.190
doughboys that were put onto ships and
 

00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:15.699
doughboys that were put onto ships and
taking taken to Europe the USS Leviathan

00:10:15.699 --> 00:10:15.709

when you read the history it was
 

00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:22.090
when you read the history it was
absolute nightmare to travel on that

00:10:22.090 --> 00:10:22.100
absolute nightmare to travel on that
 

00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:27.730

2000 were desperately ill ninety one

00:10:36.009 --> 00:10:36.019
2000 were desperately ill ninety one
 

00:10:36.019 --> 00:10:40.150
2000 were desperately ill ninety one
died and when it got to breast on the

00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:40.160
died and when it got to breast on the
 

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:45.810
died and when it got to breast on the
8th of October there were 20 miles of

00:10:45.810 --> 00:10:45.820
8th of October there were 20 miles of

ambulances and carts taking the thick of
 

00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:56.199
ambulances and carts taking the thick of
this ship and so the generals in United

00:10:56.199 --> 00:10:56.209
this ship and so the generals in United
 

00:10:56.209 --> 00:10:58.870
this ship and so the generals in United
States had decided that maybe this they

00:10:58.870 --> 00:10:58.880
States had decided that maybe this they
 

00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:02.019
States had decided that maybe this they
shouldn't send more troops because most

00:11:02.019 --> 00:11:02.029
shouldn't send more troops because most
 

00:11:02.029 --> 00:11:03.519
shouldn't send more troops because most
of them were dying in route

00:11:03.519 --> 00:11:03.529
of them were dying in route
 

00:11:03.529 --> 00:11:06.129
of them were dying in route
but President Wilson decided yes it had

00:11:06.129 --> 00:11:06.139
but President Wilson decided yes it had
 

00:11:06.139 --> 00:11:09.340
but President Wilson decided yes it had
to go on and so many young people died

00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:09.350
to go on and so many young people died
 

00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:15.730
to go on and so many young people died

couldn't decide why this virus was so
 

00:13:28.370 --> 00:13:31.870
couldn't decide why this virus was so
pathogenic next one so it was a case of

00:13:31.870 --> 00:13:31.880
pathogenic next one so it was a case of
 

00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:34.060

can say that occurred in Mexico next one

to get back i I was involved with the

00:33:35.399 --> 00:33:35.409
to get back i I was involved with the
 

00:33:35.409 --> 00:33:38.549
to get back i I was involved with the
early studies in Hong Kong where was the

00:33:38.549 --> 00:33:38.559
early studies in Hong Kong where was the
 

00:33:38.559 --> 00:33:41.190
early studies in Hong Kong where was the
virus coming from after the first and

00:33:41.190 --> 00:33:41.200
virus coming from after the first and
 

00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:43.769
virus coming from after the first and
second child had died it was coming

00:33:43.769 --> 00:33:43.779
second child had died it was coming
 

00:33:43.779 --> 00:33:46.289
second child had died it was coming
directly out of the poultry markers and

00:33:46.289 --> 00:33:46.299
directly out of the poultry markers and
 

00:33:46.299 --> 00:33:48.299
directly out of the poultry markers and
this is an actual shot of the poultry

00:33:48.299 --> 00:33:48.309
this is an actual shot of the poultry
 

00:33:48.309 --> 00:33:51.060
this is an actual shot of the poultry
markets with the ducks and the chickens

00:33:51.060 --> 00:33:51.070
markets with the ducks and the chickens
 

00:33:51.070 --> 00:33:53.279
markets with the ducks and the chickens
and the quail and everything together in

00:33:53.279 --> 00:33:53.289
and the quail and everything together in
 

00:33:53.289 --> 00:34:00.959
and the quail and everything together in
these markets and so the the the live

00:34:00.959 --> 00:34:00.969
these markets and so the the the live
 

00:34:00.969 --> 00:34:04.379
these markets and so the the the live
markets were the breeding ground I look

00:34:04.379 --> 00:34:04.389
markets were the breeding ground I look
 

00:34:04.389 --> 00:34:07.619

so just amplifies and they never in

00:34:26.510 --> 00:34:26.520

so this is one of one of the things the
 

00:34:33.460 --> 00:34:35.880
so this is one of one of the things the
reasons have happened in Hong Kong was

00:34:35.880 --> 00:34:35.890
reasons have happened in Hong Kong was
 

00:34:35.890 --> 00:34:40.410
reasons have happened in Hong Kong was
that Hong Kong built high-rise live

00:34:40.410 --> 00:34:40.420
that Hong Kong built high-rise live
 

00:34:40.420 --> 00:34:45.170

into the possibility that the preening
 

01:00:11.210 --> 01:00:15.870
into the possibility that the preening
oil can carry virus on the outside and

that's something we have to look at

01:00:42.540 --> 01:00:42.550
 

01:00:42.550 --> 01:00:44.230
thank you

thank you
so just returning to the h1n1 virus for

01:00:46.960 --> 01:00:46.970
so just returning to the h1n1 virus for
 

01:00:46.970 --> 01:00:49.630
so just returning to the h1n1 virus for
a second I was honoring since you said

01:00:49.630 --> 01:00:49.640
a second I was honoring since you said
 

01:00:49.640 --> 01:00:51.010
a second I was honoring since you said
that their viral markers were so

01:00:51.010 --> 01:00:51.020
that their viral markers were so
 

01:00:51.020 --> 01:00:52.900
that their viral markers were so
different if you could shed some light

01:00:52.900 --> 01:00:52.910
different if you could shed some light
 

01:00:52.910 --> 01:00:57.730
different if you could shed some light
on why the excess mortality trends in

01:00:57.730 --> 01:00:57.740
on why the excess mortality trends in
 

01:00:57.740 --> 01:00:59.680
on why the excess mortality trends in
terms of age group distributions were so

01:00:59.680 --> 01:00:59.690
terms of age group distributions were so
 

01:00:59.690 --> 01:01:02.650
terms of age group distributions were so
similar for example in the 2009 pandemic

01:01:02.650 --> 01:01:02.660
similar for example in the 2009 pandemic
 

01:01:02.660 --> 01:01:05.920
similar for example in the 2009 pandemic
we had around 8,000 deaths in middle age

01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:05.930
we had around 8,000 deaths in middle age
 

01:01:05.930 --> 01:01:08.500
we had around 8,000 deaths in middle age
group with significantly less like four

01:01:08.500 --> 01:01:08.510
group with significantly less like four
 

01:01:08.510 --> 01:01:10.930
group with significantly less like four
times less in the outside age groups and

01:01:10.930 --> 01:01:10.940
times less in the outside age groups and
 

01:01:10.940 --> 01:01:19.180
times less in the outside age groups and
we saw something similar my hearing is a

01:01:19.180 --> 01:01:19.190
we saw something similar my hearing is a
 

01:01:19.190 --> 01:01:21.550
we saw something similar my hearing is a
down a little bit so they shout at me a

01:01:21.550 --> 01:01:21.560
down a little bit so they shout at me a
 

01:01:21.560 --> 01:01:24.070
down a little bit so they shout at me a
little more sure uh so just returning to

01:01:24.070 --> 01:01:24.080
little more sure uh so just returning to
 

01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:26.830
little more sure uh so just returning to
h1n1 first yes right um you said that

01:01:26.830 --> 01:01:26.840
h1n1 first yes right um you said that
 

01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:28.420
h1n1 first yes right um you said that
their viral markers were very different

01:01:28.420 --> 01:01:28.430
their viral markers were very different
 

01:01:28.430 --> 01:01:30.190
their viral markers were very different
but I was wondering if you could explain

01:01:30.190 --> 01:01:30.200
but I was wondering if you could explain
 

01:01:30.200 --> 01:01:32.170
but I was wondering if you could explain
or perhaps shed some light on the

01:01:32.170 --> 01:01:32.180
or perhaps shed some light on the
 

01:01:32.180 --> 01:01:34.930
or perhaps shed some light on the
question of why the distributions of

01:01:34.930 --> 01:01:34.940
question of why the distributions of
 

01:01:34.940 --> 01:01:37.570
question of why the distributions of
mortality and infection in terms of age

01:01:37.570 --> 01:01:37.580
mortality and infection in terms of age
 

01:01:37.580 --> 01:01:40.330
mortality and infection in terms of age
groups were so similar so for example in

01:01:40.330 --> 01:01:40.340
groups were so similar so for example in
 

01:01:40.340 --> 01:01:42.700
groups were so similar so for example in
2009 we had around 8,000 deaths in the

01:01:42.700 --> 01:01:42.710
2009 we had around 8,000 deaths in the
 

01:01:42.710 --> 01:01:45.040
2009 we had around 8,000 deaths in the
middle age group but like less than 2000

01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:45.050
middle age group but like less than 2000
 

01:01:45.050 --> 01:01:47.110
middle age group but like less than 2000
on the outside and we saw something

01:01:47.110 --> 01:01:47.120
on the outside and we saw something
 

01:01:47.120 --> 01:01:49.900
on the outside and we saw something
similar in the age spectrum during 1918

01:01:49.900 --> 01:01:49.910
similar in the age spectrum during 1918
 

01:01:49.910 --> 01:01:56.260
similar in the age spectrum during 1918
as well so I I don't know that I've got

01:01:56.260 --> 01:01:56.270
as well so I I don't know that I've got
 

01:01:56.270 --> 01:01:59.890
as well so I I don't know that I've got
an answer for you I really I think you

01:01:59.890 --> 01:01:59.900
an answer for you I really I think you
 

01:01:59.900 --> 01:02:01.690
an answer for you I really I think you
you may have thought of it more than I

01:02:01.690 --> 01:02:01.700
you may have thought of it more than I
 

01:02:01.700 --> 01:02:07.480
you may have thought of it more than I
you know it's an interesting question

01:02:07.480 --> 01:02:07.490
you know it's an interesting question
 

01:02:07.490 --> 01:02:12.700
you know it's an interesting question
but you know much is made in 1918 of the

01:02:12.700 --> 01:02:12.710
but you know much is made in 1918 of the
 

01:02:12.710 --> 01:02:15.580
but you know much is made in 1918 of the
W shaped curve with that coming up in

01:02:15.580 --> 01:02:15.590
W shaped curve with that coming up in
 

01:02:15.590 --> 01:02:18.190
W shaped curve with that coming up in
the middle and you can in fact just look

01:02:18.190 --> 01:02:18.200
the middle and you can in fact just look
 

01:02:18.200 --> 01:02:21.820
the middle and you can in fact just look
at things like crude death rates or P&amp;I

01:02:21.820 --> 01:02:21.830
at things like crude death rates or P&amp;I
 

01:02:21.830 --> 01:02:24.370
at things like crude death rates or P&amp;I
pneumoniae influenza death rates to see

01:02:24.370 --> 01:02:24.380
pneumoniae influenza death rates to see
 

01:02:24.380 --> 01:02:26.980
pneumoniae influenza death rates to see
that it's it's so striking and of course

01:02:26.980 --> 01:02:26.990
that it's it's so striking and of course
 

01:02:26.990 --> 01:02:30.700
that it's it's so striking and of course
that's not usually the case but I don't

01:02:30.700 --> 01:02:30.710
that's not usually the case but I don't
 

01:02:30.710 --> 01:02:32.530
that's not usually the case but I don't
know how much analysis has actually been

01:02:32.530 --> 01:02:32.540
know how much analysis has actually been
 

01:02:32.540 --> 01:02:37.030
know how much analysis has actually been
done of those epidemic curves in 2009 I

01:02:37.030 --> 01:02:37.040
done of those epidemic curves in 2009 I
 

01:02:37.040 --> 01:02:40.090
done of those epidemic curves in 2009 I
I don't know at the moment so that's

01:02:40.090 --> 01:02:40.100
I don't know at the moment so that's
 

01:02:40.100 --> 01:02:42.820
I don't know at the moment so that's
something that I'm sure is going to be

01:02:42.820 --> 01:02:42.830
something that I'm sure is going to be
 

01:02:42.830 --> 01:02:46.230
something that I'm sure is going to be
done

01:02:46.230 --> 01:02:46.240
 

01:02:46.240 --> 01:02:48.910
and I think one other sort of an

01:02:48.910 --> 01:02:48.920
and I think one other sort of an
 

01:02:48.920 --> 01:02:51.130
and I think one other sort of an
interesting question there is is why

01:02:51.130 --> 01:02:51.140
interesting question there is is why
 

01:02:51.140 --> 01:02:52.720
interesting question there is is why
pregnant women and why are pregnant

01:02:52.720 --> 01:02:52.730
pregnant women and why are pregnant
 

01:02:52.730 --> 01:02:54.720
pregnant women and why are pregnant
women if it's greater risk and is this

01:02:54.720 --> 01:02:54.730
women if it's greater risk and is this
 

01:02:54.730 --> 01:03:00.160

unique to 2009 it's at the moment it
 

01:03:00.170 --> 01:03:06.550
unique to 2009 it's at the moment it
seems to be somewhat unique to 2009 they

I don't have the answers it's to do I

01:03:11.800 --> 01:03:11.810
I don't have the answers it's to do I
 

01:03:11.810 --> 01:03:15.060
I don't have the answers it's to do I
believe it to do with the hormonal

01:03:15.060 --> 01:03:15.070
believe it to do with the hormonal
 

01:03:15.070 --> 01:03:19.080
believe it to do with the hormonal
responses and the innate responses and

01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:19.090
responses and the innate responses and
 

01:03:19.090 --> 01:03:24.220

some form of over-production of one or
 

01:03:24.230 --> 01:03:29.890
some form of over-production of one or
other of the cytokines and probably in

01:03:29.890 --> 01:03:29.900
other of the cytokines and probably in

that area talked about the debate that

that area talked about the debate that

that area talked about the debate that
you had with Peter for lazy about the

01:03:40.420 --> 01:03:40.430
you had with Peter for lazy about the
 

01:03:40.430 --> 01:03:47.800
you had with Peter for lazy about the
question of whether you made the point

01:03:47.800 --> 01:03:47.810
question of whether you made the point
 

01:03:47.810 --> 01:03:51.580

that he didn't take into account age 7
 

01:03:51.590 --> 01:03:53.920
that he didn't take into account age 7
and I have to say I wasn't able to

01:03:53.920 --> 01:03:53.930
and I have to say I wasn't able to
 

01:03:53.930 --> 01:03:55.690
and I have to say I wasn't able to
follow you at that point in the long

follow you at that point in the long
 

01:03:55.700 --> 01:03:59.200
follow you at that point in the long

history of 8 7 among horses so could you
 

01:03:59.210 --> 01:04:01.780
history of 8 7 among horses so could you
just expand on that a bit and in terms

01:04:01.780 --> 01:04:01.790
just expand on that a bit and in terms
 

01:04:01.790 --> 01:04:05.230
just expand on that a bit and in terms
of what did she tell us her so yeah so

for a very very long time so it is says

01:04:40.660 --> 01:04:40.670
for a very very long time so it is says
 

01:04:40.670 --> 01:04:45.550
for a very very long time so it is says
to me that the mammal the horse can

01:04:45.550 --> 01:04:45.560
to me that the mammal the horse can
 

01:04:45.560 --> 01:04:50.130
to me that the mammal the horse can
support the the transmission of h1n1 and

support the the transmission of h1n1 and
 

01:04:50.140 --> 01:04:55.120
support the the transmission of h1n1 and
so we can't rule out the fact that an h5

01:04:55.120 --> 01:04:55.130
so we can't rule out the fact that an h5
 

01:04:55.130 --> 01:04:57.940
so we can't rule out the fact that an h5
or an h7 could be established

01:04:57.940 --> 01:04:57.950
or an h7 could be established
 

01:04:57.950 --> 01:05:01.930

spread it to Egypt and Africa why

01:07:04.930 --> 01:07:04.940
spread it to Egypt and Africa why
 

01:07:04.940 --> 01:07:06.220
spread it to Egypt and Africa why
doesn't it come the other way

01:07:06.220 --> 01:07:06.230
doesn't it come the other way
 

01:07:06.230 --> 01:07:08.680
doesn't it come the other way
in other words it's not thought that

in other words it's not thought that
there's some

there's some

mean is there any kind of correlation at

I don't have any effect on but you raise
 

01:07:58.489 --> 01:08:04.239
I don't have any effect on but you raise
and actually a very interesting issue

01:08:04.239 --> 01:08:04.249
and actually a very interesting issue
 

01:08:04.249 --> 01:08:07.950
and actually a very interesting issue

the question is are we going to see

01:08:30.240 --> 01:08:30.250
the question is are we going to see
 

01:08:30.250 --> 01:08:33.609
the question is are we going to see

from what you were saying one of the
 

01:08:46.759 --> 01:08:48.609
from what you were saying one of the
good things about Tamiflu is its

01:08:48.609 --> 01:08:48.619
good things about Tamiflu is its
 

01:08:48.619 --> 01:08:52.120
good things about Tamiflu is its
stability so we don't have to renew the

01:08:52.120 --> 01:08:52.130
stability so we don't have to renew the
 

01:08:52.130 --> 01:08:55.030
stability so we don't have to renew the

01:14:48.600 --> 01:14:48.610
is one year or whatever nine months and
 

01:14:48.610 --> 01:14:52.239
is one year or whatever nine months and
ethically you can't do it wasn't there

01:14:52.239 --> 01:14:52.249
ethically you can't do it wasn't there
 

01:14:52.249 --> 01:14:53.620
ethically you can't do it wasn't there
also a lot of discussion at the time

01:14:53.620 --> 01:14:53.630
also a lot of discussion at the time
 

01:14:53.630 --> 01:14:55.989
also a lot of discussion at the time
about how much cross reactivity there

01:14:55.989 --> 01:14:55.999
about how much cross reactivity there
 

01:14:55.999 --> 01:15:01.750
about how much cross reactivity there
was between the 1976 or the antibodies

01:15:01.750 --> 01:15:01.760
was between the 1976 or the antibodies
 

01:15:01.760 --> 01:15:04.779
was between the 1976 or the antibodies
raised by the 76 versus earlier

01:15:04.779 --> 01:15:04.789
raised by the 76 versus earlier
 

01:15:04.789 --> 01:15:15.719

immunizations for h1n1 complicates the I

01:15:15.719 --> 01:15:15.729
 

01:15:15.729 --> 01:15:20.009
don't know the bottom line on those

01:15:20.009 --> 01:15:20.019
don't know the bottom line on those
 

01:15:20.019 --> 01:15:25.629
don't know the bottom line on those
there has been some unusual findings in

01:15:25.629 --> 01:15:25.639
there has been some unusual findings in
 

01:15:25.639 --> 01:15:30.449
there has been some unusual findings in
Australia and in Canada of reactivity

01:15:30.449 --> 01:15:30.459
Australia and in Canada of reactivity
 

01:15:30.459 --> 01:15:36.729
Australia and in Canada of reactivity
and I think this is associated with high

01:15:36.729 --> 01:15:36.739
and I think this is associated with high
 

01:15:36.739 --> 01:15:39.189
and I think this is associated with high
levels of newer than today's in the

01:15:39.189 --> 01:15:39.199
levels of newer than today's in the
 

01:15:39.199 --> 01:15:45.279
levels of newer than today's in the
vaccine anyone else any further

01:15:45.279 --> 01:15:45.289
vaccine anyone else any further
 

01:15:45.289 --> 01:15:48.729
vaccine anyone else any further
