00:00:00.238 --> 00:00:01.843
- [Voiceover] So let's
compute the curvature of a

00:00:01.843 --> 00:00:04.527
three dimensional parametric curve

00:00:04.527 --> 00:00:07.460
and the one I have in
mind has a special name.

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:10.744
It's a helix and the first two components

00:00:10.744 --> 00:00:13.036
kind of make it look like a circle.

00:00:13.036 --> 00:00:16.122
It's going to be cosine
of t for the x component,

00:00:16.122 --> 00:00:18.019
sine of t for the y component

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:20.266
but this is three dimensional,
I know it makes it

00:00:20.266 --> 00:00:21.790
a little different from a circle.

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:23.017
I'm going to have the last component

00:00:23.017 --> 00:00:24.767
be t divided by five.

00:00:26.693 --> 00:00:28.694
And what this looks like we
can visualize it pretty well.

00:00:28.694 --> 00:00:31.306
I'm going to go on over
to the graph of it here.

00:00:31.306 --> 00:00:34.610
So this shape is called a
helix and you can see how

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:37.176
looking from the x y planes perspective

00:00:37.176 --> 00:00:38.973
it looks as if it's going to draw a circle

00:00:38.973 --> 00:00:40.623
and really these lines should all line up

00:00:40.623 --> 00:00:42.781
when you're facing it but
it's due to the perspective

00:00:42.781 --> 00:00:44.766
where things farther away look smaller.

00:00:44.766 --> 00:00:46.485
But it would just be drawing a circle,

00:00:46.485 --> 00:00:49.382
but then the z component
because z increases

00:00:49.382 --> 00:00:51.744
while your parameter t
increases, you're kind

00:00:51.744 --> 00:00:54.650
of rising, as if it's a spiral staircase.

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:56.572
And now, before we compute curvature,

00:00:56.572 --> 00:00:59.928
to know what we're really going
for, what this represents,

00:00:59.928 --> 00:01:03.168
you kind of imagine yourself
, maybe this isn't a road,

00:01:03.168 --> 00:01:06.305
but it's like a space
freeway, and you're driving

00:01:06.305 --> 00:01:09.045
your spaceship along it and
you imagine that you get stuck

00:01:09.045 --> 00:01:12.016
at some point, or maybe
not that you get stuck,

00:01:12.016 --> 00:01:13.405
but that all of your instruments lock.

00:01:13.405 --> 00:01:14.915
And your steering wheel
locks or your joystick

00:01:14.915 --> 00:01:17.014
or however you're steering,
it all just locks up

00:01:17.014 --> 00:01:21.561
and you're gonna trace out
a certain circle in space.

00:01:21.561 --> 00:01:24.505
And that circle might
look something like this.

00:01:24.505 --> 00:01:26.435
So if you were turning
however you are on the helix,

00:01:26.435 --> 00:01:28.090
but then you can't do anything different,

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:29.940
you might trace out a giant circle.

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.360
And what we care about is
the radius of that circle.

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.478
And if you take one divided
by the radius of that circle

00:01:37.478 --> 00:01:40.298
you trace out that's
going to be the curvature.

00:01:40.298 --> 00:01:42.166
That's going to be the
little kappa curvature.

00:01:42.166 --> 00:01:43.817
And of course the way that we compute it,

00:01:43.817 --> 00:01:45.495
we don't directly talk
about that circle at all,

00:01:45.495 --> 00:01:46.530
but it's actually a good thing

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.278
to keep in the back of your mind.

00:01:48.278 --> 00:01:51.613
The way that we compute
it is to first find

00:01:51.613 --> 00:01:55.168
the unit tangent vector
function with the same parameter

00:01:55.168 --> 00:01:57.993
and what that means if you
imagine your helix spiraling

00:01:57.993 --> 00:02:00.253
through three dimensional space.

00:02:00.253 --> 00:02:02.746
Man, I am not as good an
artist as the computer is

00:02:02.746 --> 00:02:05.517
when it comes to drawing a helix.

00:02:05.517 --> 00:02:07.340
But the unit tangent vector function

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.059
would be something that gives you

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:11.959
a tangent vector at every given point,

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:13.417
you know kind of the direction that you

00:02:13.417 --> 00:02:15.470
on your space ship are travelling.

00:02:16.826 --> 00:02:19.441
And to do that you take the derivative of

00:02:19.441 --> 00:02:21.245
your parameterization.

00:02:21.245 --> 00:02:22.872
That derivative, which
is going to give you

00:02:22.872 --> 00:02:25.322
a tangent vector, but it might
not be a unit tangent vector,

00:02:25.322 --> 00:02:27.785
so you divide it by its own magnitude

00:02:31.458 --> 00:02:33.727
And that'll give you
a unit tangent vector.

00:02:33.727 --> 00:02:36.256
And then ultimately, the
goal that we're shooting for

00:02:36.256 --> 00:02:38.052
is gonna be to find the derivative of this

00:02:38.052 --> 00:02:41.984
tangent vector function with
respect to the arc length.

00:02:41.984 --> 00:02:44.484
So as a first step, we'll start
by finding a derivative of

00:02:44.484 --> 00:02:46.915
our paremetarization function.

00:02:46.915 --> 00:02:48.944
So when we take that
derivative, luckily there's not

00:02:48.944 --> 00:02:51.926
a lot of new things
going on for derivatives.

00:02:51.926 --> 00:02:55.293
So S prime from single variable calculus,

00:02:55.293 --> 00:02:57.138
we just take the derivative
of each component,

00:02:57.138 --> 00:03:01.241
so cosine goes to negative sine of t.

00:03:02.477 --> 00:03:06.094
Sine, it's derivative is cosine of t

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:10.152
and then the derivative
of t divided by five

00:03:10.152 --> 00:03:11.163
is just a constant.

00:03:11.163 --> 00:03:12.583
That's just one over five.

00:03:12.583 --> 00:03:15.456
Boy, it is hard to say the
word derivative over and over.

00:03:15.456 --> 00:03:17.559
Say it five times.

00:03:17.559 --> 00:03:21.019
So that's S prime of t,
and now what we need to do

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:24.542
we need to find the
magnitude of S prime of t.

00:03:24.542 --> 00:03:28.192
So what that involves is
we're taking the magnitude

00:03:28.192 --> 00:03:30.805
S prime of t as a vector.

00:03:32.022 --> 00:03:33.282
We take the square root

00:03:33.282 --> 00:03:35.633
of the sum of the squares
of each of its components.

00:03:35.633 --> 00:03:39.265
So, sine, negative sine squared

00:03:39.265 --> 00:03:41.517
just looks like sine squared.

00:03:41.517 --> 00:03:42.900
Sine squared of t.

00:03:43.861 --> 00:03:44.791
Cosine squared.

00:03:46.436 --> 00:03:50.102
Cosine squared of t.

00:03:50.102 --> 00:03:51.755
And then one fifth squared

00:03:51.755 --> 00:03:54.412
and that's just one twenty fifth.

00:03:56.326 --> 00:03:59.897
You might notice I use a lot
of these sine cosine pairs

00:03:59.897 --> 00:04:01.783
in examples, partly
because they draw circles

00:04:01.783 --> 00:04:03.943
and lots of things are fun
that involve drawing circles.

00:04:03.943 --> 00:04:06.994
But also because it has a
tendency to let things simplify

00:04:06.994 --> 00:04:08.553
especially if you are taking a magnitude

00:04:08.553 --> 00:04:10.153
because sine squared plus cosine squared

00:04:10.153 --> 00:04:12.270
just equals one.

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:17.067
So this entire formula boils down

00:04:17.067 --> 00:04:21.434
to the square root of one
plus one divided by 25.

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.467
And for this you might be
thinking off to the side that

00:04:25.467 --> 00:04:30.467
that's 25 over 25 plus one over 25

00:04:31.544 --> 00:04:34.981
So making even more room
here, what that equals

00:04:36.227 --> 00:04:40.274
is the square root of 26 divided by 25.

00:04:43.259 --> 00:04:45.742
And just because 25 is
already a square and it might

00:04:45.742 --> 00:04:47.983
make things look nice I am
going to write this as the

00:04:47.983 --> 00:04:51.500
square root of 26 divided by 5,

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.164
the square root of 25.

00:04:53.164 --> 00:04:57.601
This whole thing is the
magnitude of our derivative.

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:00.919
And we think to ourselves,
it's quite lucky

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:02.475
that this came out to be a constant

00:05:02.475 --> 00:05:04.982
because, as we saw with
the more general formula,

00:05:04.982 --> 00:05:07.352
it's often pretty nasty
and it can get pretty bad.

00:05:07.352 --> 00:05:09.313
But in this case, it's just a constant,

00:05:09.313 --> 00:05:12.090
which is nice because
as we go up and we start

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:15.547
to think about what our
unit tangent vector function

00:05:15.547 --> 00:05:18.898
for the helix should be, we're just going

00:05:18.898 --> 00:05:20.553
to take the derivative function

00:05:20.553 --> 00:05:23.744
and divide each term by that magnitude.

00:05:23.744 --> 00:05:25.529
So it's going to look almost identical.

00:05:25.529 --> 00:05:28.406
It's going to be negative sine of t.

00:05:28.406 --> 00:05:31.173
Except now we're dividing
by that magnitude

00:05:31.173 --> 00:05:32.294
and that magnitude of course

00:05:32.294 --> 00:05:34.024
is root 26 over five,

00:05:35.016 --> 00:05:38.131
So we go up here and we
say we're dividing this

00:05:38.131 --> 00:05:42.938
by root 26 over five.

00:05:42.938 --> 00:05:44.304
That whole quantity.

00:05:45.604 --> 00:05:49.942
And then similarly y
component is cosine of t

00:05:49.942 --> 00:05:53.609
divided by the quantity of the root

00:05:53.609 --> 00:05:56.163
26 divided by 5.

00:05:57.443 --> 00:06:02.120
The last part is one fifth,
I'll put that in parenthesis,

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:05.177
divided by that same amount.

00:06:05.177 --> 00:06:06.674
root 26 over five.

00:06:06.674 --> 00:06:08.243
So we're just taking the whole vector

00:06:08.243 --> 00:06:10.243
and we're dividing it by the magnitude

00:06:10.243 --> 00:06:12.345
that it has and we're lucky, again,

00:06:12.345 --> 00:06:14.401
that even though this vector
is a function, and it can

00:06:14.401 --> 00:06:16.627
depend on t, the magnitude doesn't.

00:06:16.627 --> 00:06:19.079
So the unit tangent vector function we get

00:06:19.079 --> 00:06:21.821
as a result is relatively simple.

00:06:21.821 --> 00:06:24.829
And I'll call it a day
here and then continue on

00:06:24.829 --> 00:06:27.003
on with the same line of
reasoning in the next video.
