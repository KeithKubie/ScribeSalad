[Peter] So the simplest way to solve this problem is going to be

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
by introducing a variable.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Let's call it "first_zip."

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
To find the first_zip, it's going to be pretty straightforward,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and it's going to give us the location of the first zip.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Now we want to print out the second one,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
so let's write "print."

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
We're going to do text.find again, searching for zip,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
but this time we're going to start from the first_zip +1.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
If we didn't start from +1,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
we would get the result of first_zip again,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and that wouldn't tell us anything about a location of a second zip.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
This is one way to solve the problem using a second variable.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Another way to do this without introducing a new variable

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
is to simply put text.find right where we had first_zip before.
