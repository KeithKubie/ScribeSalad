year old cousin Nadia and just came out
a conversation that she was having

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170
a conversation that she was having
 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.519
a conversation that she was having
trouble with math and so I dug a little

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529
trouble with math and so I dug a little
 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.170
trouble with math and so I dug a little
bit deeper and it turned out that she'd

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180
bit deeper and it turned out that she'd
 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.880

because of that they put her into a

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669
because of that they put her into a
 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.490
because of that they put her into a
slower math track so when I heard that I

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500
slower math track so when I heard that I
 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.350
slower math track so when I heard that I
said hey Nadia how about when you go

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360
said hey Nadia how about when you go
 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.270

she learned unit conversion and then I

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129
she learned unit conversion and then I
 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.229
she learned unit conversion and then I
started to teach her a little bit more I

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239
started to teach her a little bit more I
 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.299
started to teach her a little bit more I
started teach her some algebra and she

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309
started teach her some algebra and she
 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:57.410
started teach her some algebra and she
actually went from being behind her

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420
actually went from being behind her
 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.910
actually went from being behind her
class to being ahead of her class and

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920
class to being ahead of her class and
 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.040
class to being ahead of her class and
you know at that point I choked I became

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050
you know at that point I choked I became
 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.170
you know at that point I choked I became
a tiger cousin and I called up her

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180
a tiger cousin and I called up her
 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.579
a tiger cousin and I called up her
school I said I think Nadia Rahman

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589
school I said I think Nadia Rahman
 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.050
school I said I think Nadia Rahman
should retake that placement exam and

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060
should retake that placement exam and
 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.060
should retake that placement exam and
they said who are you and I said I'm her

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070
they said who are you and I said I'm her
 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.090
they said who are you and I said I'm her
cousin they let her and she went from

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100
cousin they let her and she went from
 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.010
cousin they let her and she went from
the the slower math class all the way to

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020
the the slower math class all the way to
 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.260
the the slower math class all the way to
the advanced math class and so there's

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270
the advanced math class and so there's
 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.640
the advanced math class and so there's
something here I this is a small

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650
something here I this is a small
 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.140
something here I this is a small
intervention just for a few weeks with

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150
intervention just for a few weeks with
 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.600
intervention just for a few weeks with
someone I cared about so I then started

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610
someone I cared about so I then started
 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.070

working with her younger brothers and
 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.399
working with her younger brothers and
then you fast forward two years two

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409
then you fast forward two years two
 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.859
then you fast forward two years two
things happen one word got around the

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460
family that free tutoring was going on
 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.690
family that free tutoring was going on
so I found myself with on the order of

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700
so I found myself with on the order of
 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.880
so I found myself with on the order of
10 or 15 cousins and family friends

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890
10 or 15 cousins and family friends
 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.609

and I was getting on conference calls

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939
and I was getting on conference calls
 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.969
and I was getting on conference calls
with them and whatnot and I also started

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979
with them and whatnot and I also started
 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.160
with them and whatnot and I also started
building software for them to make sure

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170
building software for them to make sure
 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.080
building software for them to make sure
that they had a strong foundations and

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090
that they had a strong foundations and
 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.389
that they had a strong foundations and
things like basic arithmetic fractions

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399
things like basic arithmetic fractions
 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.700
things like basic arithmetic fractions
decimals exponents and that software

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710
decimals exponents and that software
 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.020
decimals exponents and that software
that I was making for them that gave

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030
that I was making for them that gave
 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.700
that I was making for them that gave
them as much practice as they needed and

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710
them as much practice as they needed and
 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.130
them as much practice as they needed and
solutions and a way for me as their

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140
solutions and a way for me as their
 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.389
solutions and a way for me as their
tutor to keep track of what they were

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399
tutor to keep track of what they were
 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.270
tutor to keep track of what they were
doing that was the first incarnation of

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280
doing that was the first incarnation of
 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.620
doing that was the first incarnation of
Khan Academy that's when I got the

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630
Khan Academy that's when I got the
 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.230
Khan Academy that's when I got the
domain name khanacademy.org and at that

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240
domain name khanacademy.org and at that
 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.420
domain name khanacademy.org and at that
point it had absolutely nothing to do

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430
point it had absolutely nothing to do
 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.160
point it had absolutely nothing to do
with videos and even then

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170
with videos and even then
 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:10.260
with videos and even then
just view that as a hobby and I was kind

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270
just view that as a hobby and I was kind
 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:11.940
just view that as a hobby and I was kind
of running this website and I it was fun

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950
of running this website and I it was fun
 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.339
of running this website and I it was fun
for me to hack on the software but then

00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:14.349
for me to hack on the software but then
 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:15.660

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.000
model here in fact I didn't want there
to be a business model on it I wanted

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010
to be a business model on it I wanted
 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:37.080

something that I want it's social good
 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:40.740
something that I want it's social good
it's a it's something that should just

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600
Academy I said one this I'm doing this
 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.000
Academy I said one this I'm doing this
not because I want it to be a business

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010
not because I want it to be a business
 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:49.470
not because I want it to be a business
I'm doing this because I think it could

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480
I'm doing this because I think it could
 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.870
I'm doing this because I think it could
be a huge social good for the planet and

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880
be a huge social good for the planet and
 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.150
be a huge social good for the planet and
I want to do it in a way that is for

then once you start getting validation
of these hypotheses then yeah you know
