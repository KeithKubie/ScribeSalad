well my experience with tremors was

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340
well my experience with tremors was
 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.100
well my experience with tremors was
essentially this my friends and I when

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110
essentially this my friends and I when
 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:32.960
essentially this my friends and I when
we were very young like elementary

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970
we were very young like elementary
 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.270
we were very young like elementary
school-aged had this game we played at

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280
school-aged had this game we played at
 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.850
school-aged had this game we played at
playgrounds and we called it tremors now

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860
playgrounds and we called it tremors now
 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.760
playgrounds and we called it tremors now
one person was the tremor and everyone

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770
one person was the tremor and everyone
 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:42.590
one person was the tremor and everyone
else were the humans and the only safe

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600
else were the humans and the only safe
 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.960
else were the humans and the only safe
place would be on high ground so if you

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970
place would be on high ground so if you
 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.730
place would be on high ground so if you
could get on top of like a brick

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:46.740
could get on top of like a brick
 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.680
could get on top of like a brick
structure or a jungle gym

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690
structure or a jungle gym
 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.630
structure or a jungle gym
you'd be safe but if the tremor touches

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640
you'd be safe but if the tremor touches
 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.820
you'd be safe but if the tremor touches
you you're dead and whoever is the last

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830
you you're dead and whoever is the last
 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.860
you you're dead and whoever is the last
human standing essentially wins and my

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870
human standing essentially wins and my
 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.210
human standing essentially wins and my
friends and I played that all the time

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220
friends and I played that all the time
 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.010
friends and I played that all the time
the funny part of the story is is I

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020
the funny part of the story is is I
 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.430
the funny part of the story is is I
actually didn't know what it was for

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440
actually didn't know what it was for
 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.620
actually didn't know what it was for
because I hadn't seen tremors yet

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630
because I hadn't seen tremors yet
 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.270
because I hadn't seen tremors yet
because we were like I don't know six or

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280
because we were like I don't know six or
 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.370
because we were like I don't know six or
seven years old and I hadn't yet seen

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380
seven years old and I hadn't yet seen
 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.800
seven years old and I hadn't yet seen
tremors until I was probably about ten

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810
tremors until I was probably about ten
 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.750
tremors until I was probably about ten
and so I was like what is this this game

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760
and so I was like what is this this game
 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.220
and so I was like what is this this game
is cool I like it and then one day I

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230
is cool I like it and then one day I
 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:18.100
is cool I like it and then one day I
watched tremors and I was just like ah

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.110
 
 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:20.930
 
everything makes sense now so the first
