HENRY SHACKLETON: So
in this classroom,

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:09.400
we had sort of a flipped
format where before every lab

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.640
you'd go through questions
online, watch presentation

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:13.900
videos online.

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.636
And I think that really helped
because lab classes sort

00:00:17.636 --> 00:00:19.510
of inherently when you're
doing the analysis,

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:22.090
doing all the data collection,
they're very independent.

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:24.640
So you don't have a professor
telling you do this, do that.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.010
You're on your own doing
this data collection.

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:29.380
And the fact that
the pre-lab, sort

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.120
of going through and
learning the stuff,

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:32.890
you do that by yourself as well.

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.680
You sort of independently
learn all this stuff

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.650
and research by yourself and
find out things by yourself.

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:43.030
That sort of helps to lead you
into the ultimate data analysis

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:45.550
and making a presentation by
yourself and doing all of this

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.700
independently.
