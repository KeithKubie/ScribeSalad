00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.140
We're gonna talk about error bars and to talk about error bars, we're gonna use Aero bars.

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:12.200
These chocolate bars, I don't think you get them in the US, we certainly have them in the UK.

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.920
I've eaten a lot of this chocolate in my time. It's full of bubbles

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.940
Bubbly delicious goodness. So, we're gonna actually melt the bubbles.

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:26.980
Well, we're gonna melt the chocolate and we're gonna do it because we're gonna measure the speed of light with chocolate.

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:29.080
This is an experiment that's...

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:30.960
You go anywhere in the internet,

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.860
You can find lots and lots of people talking about this experiment, lots of people have done this experiment in the past.

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.240
It's not so much the experiment itself. What we're actually doing this for is to put across the key

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:47.540
importance of experimental uncertainties and experimental error bars, and I can almost feel the waves of

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:52.600
disgust as undergraduate students or any students who might be watching this because

00:00:53.560 --> 00:01:00.980
Error bars in first-year are something that we spend so much time teaching students about and let's be honest,

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.840
they're not the most exciting aspect of the science.

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:11.200
But they are absolutely key because if you quote a result without quoting an error bar, you're not even wrong.

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:17.840
If I can paraphrase Pauli: without that error bar, nobody knows what your uncertainties are, nobody knows

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.080
how well you did the experiment. You can't compare your result with any other experiments.

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.119
So what we're gonna do with this chocolate is we're gonna put it in this microwave sitting in this fume cupboard.

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:33.300
I should note that the reason we've got the fume cupboard, and we've got a smoke detector covered up

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.760
is that earlier today when I was preparing this experiment,

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:43.020
I attempted to do it in my office, and I didn't cover up the smoke detector and

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.740
the alarm went off in the building and hundreds of people were evacuated.

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:55.648
It was a big deal. It was a big embarrassing deal and the security people are not happy with me.

00:01:55.648 --> 00:01:57.880
It's a bit like Willy Wonka's chocolate factory, isn't it.

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.880
Brady: Look at that.
Moriaty: Is there gold? No, okay.

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.040
Right, that's what it looks like

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.840
but we're actually going to use this side. Some of you will have seen this experiment

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.200
but for those of you who haven't, what we're gonna do: I'm gonna put it in here,

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.300
we're going to heat it up and it will melt, if the experiment works,

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:21.140
in specific places and the places in which it melts are directly related to the wavelength of the microwaves.

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:27.600
So what's absolutely key if anybody does want to do this is you normally have a little rotating thing, the little spindle

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.920
(That's the word, spindle.) that sits in here that rotates the the plate around and rotates the food round.

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.220
We don't want that. We want it to sit in one place, and they'd be bombarded

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.900
so it doesn't doesn't move around because I will disturb the pattern.

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.540
Not that I can see anything. [laughs]

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:54.480
We might have to do this again. Let's see where we are, whether we've got any.. oh oh no!

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:04.360
Yes, it's definitely worked. There we go. Yeah, okay one last try.

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:17.040
It's melting it already. There we go, 1, 2, 3. Actually that was 20 seconds.

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.120
Now it's gonna take five minutes of course.

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.780
It's just a mess, you can't really see 'em.

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:38.180
(Bollocks.)

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:40.980
Brady: Oh it smells delicious.
Moriaty: Mhm.

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.620
It's worked out okay about as well as the the experiment works.

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:52.600
It's a very good experiment to demonstrate this real importance of uncertainties because

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:58.800
so often in science is this idea that science proves this and science proves that and evidence so exact,

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:04.700
it's not. So, they went to the microwave and they were blasted for various times between

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:09.680
10 seconds and up to 30 seconds and as you can see, sometimes well

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.060
decent imprints were formed and then other times it sort of

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:20.000
formed a bit of a splodge. In the microwave oven, you've got waves of electromagnetic radiation,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.580
and it's those waves that are given rise to the heating of course.

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:30.100
Where you have peaks in the electromagnetic radiation, which are called antinodes,

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:34.780
you get a lot of power injected into the chocolate and hence it melts.

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:41.539
So what we're seeing this pattern is an imprint of the standing wave pattern in the microwave oven.

00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:44.259
Normally, if food spins round on that spindle

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:49.269
We disabled that spindle because what we wanted was the opposite of what you normally want in your food

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:50.860
You don't want localized hot spots

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:58.330
We wanted localized hot spots because also hot spots tell us about the microwaves and the distribution and the pattern of microwaves in the oven

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:00.609
So the distance between the peaks

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.899
Within the oven that is half a wavelength

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:12.010
Because that is Hertha, that's a wavelength is where the whole cycle repeats, this is half a wave event

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:16.149
That's all we need that's that that's really we need that and we need one other

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:21.909
Equation which are put in the microwave down here, which is this the speed of light?

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:25.210
Is equal to frequency of the microwaves?

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:27.139
times

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:32.649
The wavelength frequency F. Let's write it up. Here is two point four five

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:39.429
Gigahertz I know that because it's written on the back of the microwave oven so the important thing is that the peaks here

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:46.870
Between these tell us lambda over to tell us the wavelength divided by two, so we measure the distance between these

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:55.720
Okay, so that's about eight six about seven, okay, so we've got three three measurements we'd like to have more

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:59.289
It's the first thing, but what's the best thing to do here?

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:00.620
Let's take an average

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:07.179
So we've got eight centimeters six centimeter and seven centimeter would seem that the best thing to do would you take an aperture?

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:11.590
So let's say a seven centimeters like this is a wavelength of fourteen centimeters

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:15.580
So say is equal to F times

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.960
Fourteen centimeters

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:24.970
F we know is two point four five gigahertz

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:29.260
Because we read that off the back of the microwave by fourteen centimeters

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:31.390
So we want to speed the light which is C

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:33.170
Which is in meters per second?

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:40.539
So let's make sure we get were careful with our units so that's two point four five a Giga is ten to the nine

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:43.330
Hertz

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:47.739
By in terms of meters, that's zero point one four meters

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:49.820
what we have

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:57.279
Is say three point four so zero point two three four three so that's zero point three four

00:06:57.530 --> 00:06:59.300
three

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:05.289
We could for the physicists among you I know in terms of significant figures, but let's keep going

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:13.539
So see our result is three point four three by ten to the eighth meters

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:17.180
Per second

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:19.750
That's the speed of light as determined by chocolate

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:20.980
That's not good

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:21.490
Is it?

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:26.590
Because we know what the speed of light is and it's pretty damn close to three by ten to the eighth meters per second

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:35.379
So it's actually three and you've got three point four yeah on the basis of chocolate. I think that's pretty good. How do we know?

00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:41.469
Good compared to what so can we rarely quote to the four point point four three?

00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:47.860
How many of those figures are valid or significant or any of those figures significant sometimes we do experiments to try and?

00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:55.119
Check a previous value and then often we do experiments because we're reaching out into the unknown

00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:59.300
How do we know could you do hundred of them another thousand?

00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:04.430
We could definitely do another hut thousand of them, but still then how do we know even after those a thousand?

00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:12.529
How do we know anything exactly so what we have to think about as this this value is quoted. We're not right?

00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:14.480
We're not wrong. When are even right?

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:15.230
We're not even wrong

00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:18.530
we can do nothing with this value because we don't know what the

00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:25.309
Experimental uncertainty is we don't know how well we've done the experiment. We don't know how many of those figures are significant

00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:26.670
We don't know

00:08:26.670 --> 00:08:31.009
You know can we measure to the second decimal place to the fifth decimal place?

00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:37.520
We don't know so we find that our value ranges from 12 through 14 to 16 so our value is

00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:45.349
14 the best way to quote is that we have lambda is equal to 14 plus or minus 2

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:47.880
centimeters

00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:49.880
All right

00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:51.890
How does that translate into?

00:08:52.260 --> 00:09:00.050
How we quote our value for the speed of light, so we know we've got this value this error in in lambda

00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:04.819
so what we see is we would typically you can either do a big dealt or a little delta typically we call it a

00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:05.930
little Delta

00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:12.229
I will do a big Delta because my handwriting is absolutely terrible so Delta Lambda is equal to plus or minus 2

00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:17.809
Centimeters or actually we'll just leave the plus or minus. I Delta lambda is 2 centimeters. That's our error bar

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:24.079
So what we find is see of what we know was C is equal to F times lambda

00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:31.910
We're going to assume because it's written on the back of the microwave that the frequency. We just got we've got no idea

00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:37.279
How you know what error there might be and that's all we're just going to assume that it's a given value

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:41.749
That we don't know what the area is so we're just gonna treat. It as without an error. It's it's a value

00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:45.559
We've been handed down what we need to do is work out the error in C

00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:52.400
Depending on the error in lambda, but the problem is we'll see as m/s. And lambda is meters and

00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:55.520
We can't compare we can't just go this is

00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:58.700
centimeters then

00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:02.119
We need a value in meters per second, so what do we do here?

00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:07.700
Well what we have to do is look at something called a percentage error or the relative error so what we know is that?

00:10:07.890 --> 00:10:13.619
Delta C the error and C in the speed of light over see is equal to delta lambda

00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:17.219
Over lambda this is just basically percentages

00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:23.610
That's all we're doing we're expressing our error in C as a percentage of C and that presented the percentage error in C

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:29.430
Would be the same as the percentage error in London because we're assuming this das. Nove an error all right so Delta C over

00:10:30.339 --> 00:10:32.819
C is equal to two centimeters

00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:35.580
over fourteen centimeters

00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:40.500
All right, so our percentage error in C is

00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:45.929
About well as one over seven and plays our error in C

00:10:46.870 --> 00:10:53.909
Delta C is one over seven times our value of C which was three point four 3

00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:56.640
by 10 to the eighth

00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:01.200
So if we worked out through work out what 1/7 of 3.43 is

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:04.580
0.49 by 10 to the eighth

00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:10.980
Now, the standard approach and as long as we all stick to this then

00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:14.580
everybody can compare the results is that we call to one significant figure or

00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:19.760
If you're a bit more careful, and you can justify it like they do in the National Physical Lab or in this,

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:21.300
maybe two significant figures.

00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:23.500
We're going to do what is

00:11:24.610 --> 00:11:27.209
done in first-year labs across the world and

00:11:28.089 --> 00:11:30.299
We're going to quote that to one significant figure

00:11:33.339 --> 00:11:38.669
So that means our final results for the speed of light is

00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:45.330
we've quoted this to one decimal place so we need to get this to agree, so we'll get rid of the

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:48.600
the three the second decimal place

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:59.489
Without putting our error bar in place the value of C the speed of light from our experiment falls somewhere between

00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:04.650
Two point nine and three point nine by ten to the eighth meters per second now

00:12:04.650 --> 00:12:06.120
We can compare that to the speed of light

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:11.909
We really shouldn't because that's not how you do experimental science because it biases you in one direction

00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:15.779
We should try and do this as objectively as possible without being skewed

00:12:15.779 --> 00:12:18.659
But we know in terms of comparing that to the speed of light

00:12:19.209 --> 00:12:25.199
That we've done a pretty good job because the actual speed of light falls within the error bar the problem is and to

00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:29.329
Often we have to correct this time and time and time again in undergraduate labs

00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:31.910
the error bar the

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:38.959
Experimental error is not the difference of the the value dot dot 3.4 from the speed of light

00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:44.569
That's not how you do it. It's not like it's a mistake and error is not a mistake. There's a there's an inbuilt

00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:51.650
Uncertainty in our measurements and there's an inbuilt uncertainty in every single measurement we take doesn't matter if it's to the nth decimal place

00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:56.600
to the tenth the fifteen to twenty eighth decimal place no matter how precise you get

00:12:57.180 --> 00:12:58.950
You're never going to be

00:12:58.950 --> 00:13:01.819
So precise that you're infinitesimally precise

00:13:03.570 --> 00:13:07.670
Upside down and when he's trapped there his mom is you know really worried about him

00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:13.670
But she figures out that he's not missing and actually she can communicate with him when he's in this parallel universe
