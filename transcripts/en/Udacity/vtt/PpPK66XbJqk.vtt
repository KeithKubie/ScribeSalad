00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Now that we have an equation for that almost geostationary orbit.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Let's look at what the computer simulation does to that, so we start at this point, wait for 24 hours,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
precisely 24 hours, and look at what's going to happen.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Most probably, we're not going to reach that same precise location but end up

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
in a slightly different location, and the objective of this quiz is to compute

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:36.000
the distance between the initial position and the position after precisely 24 hours

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
to learn about the error of our method.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
We've got tons of stuff predefined ready for you to use.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Your job is to insert the Euler forward method right at this point.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Your job is not to return the positions and the velocities, your job is to return just a single number,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.000
namely the error--the distance between the initial position and the final position--

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
and up front of course compute the step size.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Given the number of steps, make sure that you actually are taking, for instance, 200 steps

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
after that initial position or 500 or 1000 and so on.
