1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:03,840
Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm
Robert Krulwich Radiolab.

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:08,250
Today we're going to start off with
a building, not just any building,

3
00:00:08,251 --> 00:00:09,390
but a building that is

4
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:15,440
heavy with secrets and it's a building
we first really learned about,

5
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:19,020
or at least got a picture of
from this woman Katie Engelhart.

6
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:22,980
I'm a reporter at Vice News
in London, in Katy. Like now,

7
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:27,981
all of us at radio lab
is obsessed devastatingly
obsessed with this place called

8
00:00:28,501 --> 00:00:29,610
Hansel o park.

9
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:34,730
So Hansel park is this huge sprawling
complex in Buckinghamshire near a town

10
00:00:35,371 --> 00:00:39,180
called Milton keens, which
isn't too far from London.

11
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,160
And our producer Jamie
Yorke, check, check,

12
00:00:41,161 --> 00:00:44,340
check happened to be in London on
vacation. So we asked them, well,

13
00:00:44,341 --> 00:00:47,490
why don't you scrap your tape recorder
and go down there? Yeah, let's do this.

14
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:51,450
Check it out. So it's a
bit of a drive from London,

15
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:55,310
about an hour and a half on the
m one m two you approached this,

16
00:00:55,690 --> 00:01:00,690
this sort of beautiful town with adorable
little posh cottages and little pubs.

17
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:05,410
Not from around here. I'm
looking for, yeah, I mean it's,

18
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:08,730
it's your sort of typical
e all day British village.

19
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:17,400
About a four minute drive past that new
old town. You go through some fields,

20
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:21,240
crest over a hill and there it is.

21
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:27,420
This massive, massive buildings surrounded
by razor wire. What's going on here?

22
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:33,200
So the archives are housed in a purpose
belt belting from the 90s and these are

23
00:01:34,081 --> 00:01:37,200
archives, by the way, from
the largest empire ever known.

24
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:41,790
It's like if you were creating a movie
set for like a secret government compound

25
00:01:41,791 --> 00:01:45,570
where they keep secret files, you
would literally just make this

26
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:51,090
Jamie parked a quarter mile away and
walked up to the gate. There's some pig,

27
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:54,300
looks like electrified
fence through the gate,

28
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:59,370
taller than me pass these traffic spikes
and just as he barely stepped inside,

29
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:03,500
are you going to call to call with? No,

30
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:07,890
I'm no comfortable with
any of this activity you're
doing. The guard grabs him,

31
00:02:07,891 --> 00:02:12,410
takes him to a guard house. That
is, it's a microphone disconnected.

32
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:17,330
While you're in here though, please.
And then where is your vehicle?

33
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:22,160
Right. Okay. They walk him.

34
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:26,000
Are you going to escort me all the way
back to my car the entire quarter mile

35
00:02:26,001 --> 00:02:26,834
back to his car.

36
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:32,190
Now we've heard it said that
the files in that building,

37
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:36,720
if they were ever released, could
rewrite 200 years of history.

38
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,900
No idea if that's true, we just don't
know. But we're starting to know,

39
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:43,650
and today we're going to focus on
the one story that has so far anyway,

40
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:47,220
tumbled out kind of by
accident. And it's a story

41
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:56,400
that we find kind of startling and we
should also warn that there's some stuff

42
00:02:56,401 --> 00:03:00,040
coming up that is graphic and
disturbing. So if you're listening with

43
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,260
kids, you might want to skip this one.

44
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:06,940
Although if you're not listening with
kids, don't skip it. Don't skip it. Okay.

45
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:14,330
[inaudible]

46
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:15,730
a story is the Puna.

47
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:18,700
Kenya was always a scene.

48
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:22,810
This is a story in David Anderson
and a kind of Sepia tinted Hays.

49
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:27,290
Many of you guys are go Kim white band
of adventure pioneers who found the

50
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:30,880
country beautiful. The climate
kind on the soil per tile.

51
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:34,680
Bougainvillea sunshines
smiling, happy servants.

52
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:39,720
David says in the 1910s twenties thirties
the British public was obsessed with

53
00:03:39,721 --> 00:03:42,750
Kenya. You had books,
eventually television programs.

54
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,700
It was one of the crown
jewels of the empire.

55
00:03:44,701 --> 00:03:48,660
And so you had all of these Brits leaving
Britain and going to Kenya to start a

56
00:03:48,661 --> 00:03:49,494
new life. And many,

57
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:53,910
many of the settlers who flopped out
to Kenya were lower middle classes who

58
00:03:53,911 --> 00:03:57,960
could have a much better salary and a
much better living standard in Kenya than

59
00:03:57,961 --> 00:03:59,160
they ever could back at home.

60
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:04,020
They stayed and found of
the young culinary where men
make the homes where that

61
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:06,640
children are born, taught
and grow strong and healthy.

62
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:12,370
Now it probably goes without saying that
this new life for the Britta citizen

63
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,940
came at the expense of the Kenyan who
was already living there to problems that

64
00:04:15,941 --> 00:04:19,420
were always encountered in Africa and in
general with colonization is the issue

65
00:04:19,421 --> 00:04:23,200
of land in the issue of labor. That's
Harvard historian, Carolina Elkins.

66
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:24,610
She'll play a big role in our story.

67
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:28,090
So in Kenya they solve the land problem
by simply alienating it and giving it to

68
00:04:28,091 --> 00:04:30,370
the white farmers, but then
becomes the labor problem.

69
00:04:30,371 --> 00:04:35,371
How do you force Africans to
labor cheaply on plantations,

70
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:38,950
right? Like in this case,
tea and coffee? Well,

71
00:04:38,951 --> 00:04:41,590
the way you do it is you create
what are called native reserves.

72
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:43,960
We had them here for
four native Americans.

73
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:47,110
She basically says that the native
Kenyans were forced off of their land into

74
00:04:47,111 --> 00:04:49,270
slums where they could
barely eke out a living.

75
00:04:49,271 --> 00:04:53,170
And so the only option they had
was to work for the white people.

76
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:58,490
And that's how it went for, for
decades until the second war

77
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:03,180
or act as the question has
started, all cards gather

78
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,810
in 1939 suddenly thousands
and thousands of men,

79
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,820
young Kenyan men are forced in the war.

80
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:13,080
The people of Africa are doing excellent
work to help the allied cause many get

81
00:05:13,081 --> 00:05:14,170
thrown into the British army,

82
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:18,630
you kings African rifles and among the
finest troops in the empire where they

83
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:21,330
came in contact with ideas of independence

84
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:25,140
and they anticipated when they returned

85
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:30,780
the day that they're,

86
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:31,780
that they

87
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:35,150
would have access to land, that their
conditions would be getting better.

88
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:38,840
But nope, they, uh,

89
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:42,620
they find their condition is not only
not gotten better, it's gotten worse.

90
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:44,710
And so after the war,

91
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:49,690
a few of these vets from the largest
ethnic group in Kenya called the Kikuyu,

92
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:53,050
they get together and they
decided to take an oath.

93
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:58,010
No owning is traditional amongst

94
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,990
the Kikuyu. So for example,

95
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:04,250
men a hundred years ago or more would
take an oath pledging allegiance to their

96
00:06:04,251 --> 00:06:07,430
ethnic group as they went to war
with somebody else. In this case,

97
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:11,990
they'd take an oath pledging themselves
to kick all Europeans out of the colony.

98
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,270
Then the earth good, something like this.

99
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:17,660
I pledge to kick all Europeans out
of the colony, uh, out of Kenya.

100
00:06:17,661 --> 00:06:19,520
And if I don't, may this oath kill me.

101
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:23,180
I pledge to take up arms against the
Europeans if I don't make this, Oh,

102
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:26,150
kill me. Now of course, the last
thing that was said always was,

103
00:06:26,151 --> 00:06:29,990
if I reveal the contents of this
oath, may this oath kill me.

104
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:36,650
She says, the first thing they did
was attack the settlers livestock,

105
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:41,510
doing things like hamstring cattle,
hamstringing cattle cut their hamstrings,

106
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,140
your hamstrings, so they can't walk.
They started destroying property.

107
00:06:45,141 --> 00:06:48,910
Their oath started to involve
things like goat eyeballs, Ram,

108
00:06:48,911 --> 00:06:52,690
scrotums and tested blood.
Things that absolutely a,

109
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:56,270
the local European settlers
and put terror into them.

110
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,520
And why do they end up calling
themselves the Mal Mal? Well,

111
00:06:58,521 --> 00:07:02,530
that's a good question. It's the
etymology of that as much debated, um,

112
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:06,320
with nobody quite agreeing on,
on how it, how it came to pass.

113
00:07:06,321 --> 00:07:08,560
But Malmo is many thing.

114
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:11,990
Is this why he only derivative of sort
of more and more that there's, you know,

115
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:12,950
um, uh,

116
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:17,300
some say it has to do with you [inaudible]
I don't play this one over hearing

117
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:21,020
what was the Malmo Oath,
whatever the case in 1952,

118
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:24,180
[inaudible]

119
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:27,060
colonial government, which was
served the British arm in Kenya,

120
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:31,620
they declare a state of emergency and
those pudgy and legions to the Malmo,

121
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:35,070
they escalate. They start
going after the loyalists.

122
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:36,600
The Kenyans had been helping the settlers

123
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:40,100
savagely attacking the defense that
shooting them or they weren't at the

124
00:07:40,101 --> 00:07:43,730
monitoring one assassination
after the next men and women were,

125
00:07:43,731 --> 00:07:47,550
their bodies are whatever they
raid loyalists, villages with club

126
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:51,830
[inaudible] in the British or
they're terrified, oh, sorry.

127
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:52,990
In the streets of Naomi,

128
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:56,900
this is the night of the long nights
coming to into reality and it's only about

129
00:07:56,901 --> 00:07:57,734
to get worse.

130
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:02,460
And that happens on the
night of January 24th, 1953,

131
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:06,210
which was the murder of the RUC family.
The rucks were these very young,

132
00:08:06,211 --> 00:08:08,850
lovely couple. Roger
Rock was a farmer as me.

133
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:13,500
Ruck was a doctor who actually
administered to the local
population and they had

134
00:08:13,501 --> 00:08:16,440
a little boy named Michael
who was six. Just that day,

135
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:20,520
the little boy had fallen off his pony
and his one of their trusted servants

136
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:23,310
carried him back up to the
house. Later that night,

137
00:08:23,311 --> 00:08:25,350
a group of Mamao crept out of the forest,

138
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:30,600
lured Roger Nesbie ruck out of the house,
killed them, and then the whole gang,

139
00:08:30,601 --> 00:08:34,080
including that same servant that had
helped the boy, they march into the house,

140
00:08:34,081 --> 00:08:38,760
go up to the little boys room and they
hack them to death and there's a very

141
00:08:38,761 --> 00:08:42,840
famous photo of the young
boys dead, absolutely buddied,

142
00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:48,170
which is an every major newspaper
and almost overnight mal mal becomes

143
00:08:48,871 --> 00:08:53,040
synonymous with pure evil in our mind,

144
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:56,340
in children's mind.
Mauer bigger than life,

145
00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:01,200
darkest, dark people that you
ever saw. Men, men, men, men,

146
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:04,260
men. Yeah. And actually
as we were reporting this
story, one of our producers,

147
00:09:04,261 --> 00:09:09,261
a lot of Nasser told us about how his
mom grew up next door to Kenya in what is

148
00:09:09,781 --> 00:09:13,200
now called Tanzania Jack.
And to her and her friends,

149
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:18,090
the Malmo were like like a monster
to children. The boogeyman,

150
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:22,200
that was sort of a threat
all the time. Our barrier,

151
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:27,350
our mothers especially would refer to if
if you don't drink your milk or if you

152
00:09:27,781 --> 00:09:31,260
don't sleep [inaudible] hey my mama. Okay.

153
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:36,300
Bolani so the Mama will come and
get ya. And how scared were you?

154
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:41,040
You know what? Just the
word Mau would make us run,

155
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:42,293
crawl under the bed.

156
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:47,470
I'm old enough to be one of the people
who thought that there were a calming

157
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:48,990
[inaudible].

158
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:53,990
They were like a isis or some weird
sort of self organizing terrorist group.

159
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:56,070
Yes. The most peace Geo horrible,

160
00:09:56,130 --> 00:10:00,270
awful savage movement that I had ever
hit the face of the British empire. Okay,

161
00:10:00,271 --> 00:10:03,210
so here's where we get to the part
of the story that is in deep flux.

162
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:05,640
After the murder of the rock family,

163
00:10:05,641 --> 00:10:09,900
the settlers demanded that the colonial
government do something and they did.

164
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:11,430
They pursued the Malmo fighters,

165
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:14,900
supposedly small band of
fighters into the forest. Uh,

166
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,360
there were skirmishes that
lasted for years. Story goes,

167
00:10:18,361 --> 00:10:23,361
the Malmo Movement never quite gained
traction and ultimately the British

168
00:10:23,371 --> 00:10:25,050
quelled the rebellion. They handled it.

169
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:30,390
Now as for how they handled it for the
longest times, people would look back.

170
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:35,190
It was this giant blank spot.
No one quite knew what happened.

171
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:37,740
And here's why. According
to David Anderson,

172
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:42,090
by the time the British finally decided
to leave Kenya, and this is 1963,

173
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:42,890
by that

174
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:47,530
time, Kenya is around the 20th different
colony that Britain will leave.

175
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:49,480
So it's about halfway down the list.

176
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:53,380
So there's already in place a process.

177
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:55,310
Kathy, well Hello Stadium.

178
00:10:55,311 --> 00:10:58,970
The articles of independence were handed
by the Duke to the country's prime

179
00:10:58,971 --> 00:10:59,620
minister.

180
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:04,060
There's a formal exchange of powers.
They set off fireworks and then

181
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:07,350
at midnight they union. Jack
was low at about the last time,

182
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:08,880
the Brits Rollout, in other words,

183
00:11:08,881 --> 00:11:13,620
date run us Ruth and
colorful and happy exit.

184
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:18,510
And at some point in that well-worn exit
process either right before the exit,

185
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:23,250
right afterwards there was, as David
calls it, the weeding of documents.

186
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,820
I mean the British
government conducted very,

187
00:11:28,821 --> 00:11:32,570
very sophisticated purge operations
in all of its former colonies.

188
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:36,200
It's Katie Inglehart again, she says
everywhere you look, Uganda, Palestine,

189
00:11:36,201 --> 00:11:39,260
Rhodesia, Zanzibar, Nigeria,
Jordan, Malaya, Hong Kong.

190
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:44,290
There are stories of papers being kind
of tightly packed into boxes and dropped

191
00:11:44,691 --> 00:11:47,270
at sea. A lot of papers were burned.

192
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:51,830
There's a joke in among Indian historians
on the day the India achieved its

193
00:11:51,831 --> 00:11:54,010
independence when the celebrations

194
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:55,330
were taking place in Delhi.

195
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:59,500
You could hardly see what was going on
on the podium cause the waft of smoke

196
00:11:59,501 --> 00:12:02,110
blowing across from the
bonfires of burning documents.

197
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,980
All of which is to say
that it was, you know,

198
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:07,780
as soon for 30 years did that blank
spot of the Mal mal emergency would just

199
00:12:07,781 --> 00:12:09,520
stay blank and the
story of the Evil Malmo,

200
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:13,450
which is continue because there
were no documents to say otherwise.

201
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:16,810
But then we get to Carolina
Elkins. How did you,

202
00:12:16,811 --> 00:12:21,811
like once upon a time you were a
curious young Grad student or something?

203
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:25,060
Not more or less. In fact we,
you even have to go back further.

204
00:12:25,061 --> 00:12:27,430
You know I'm dating
myself at age 45 but the,

205
00:12:27,431 --> 00:12:32,431
I have to go back to my undergraduate
years talking 1990 and I was at Princeton

206
00:12:32,621 --> 00:12:33,400
and when we were,

207
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:37,060
you know you do senior thesis there and
Princeton was ahead of its time and I

208
00:12:37,061 --> 00:12:39,640
got lots of funding and I
went off to London and Kenya.

209
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,620
And how old are you when
you're taking this trip?

210
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:46,710
Oh I'm 20 so Caroline is working in
Nairobi and I'm doing research at the time

211
00:12:47,171 --> 00:12:49,060
my senior thesis was
looking at the Kikuyu,

212
00:12:49,061 --> 00:12:50,740
which is the largest
ethnic group in Kenya.

213
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:56,490
And I was looking primarily
at the shifting roles of
women and the ways in which

214
00:12:56,681 --> 00:12:58,570
they were impacted by
colonialism. So Caroline,

215
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:03,550
it was wake up every morning and would
walk to this old colonial building right

216
00:13:03,551 --> 00:13:07,750
in Nairobi city center called the
National Archives. It's loud, it's dusty.

217
00:13:07,751 --> 00:13:09,370
It's, um, you know,

218
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:12,370
sometimes you had to jump under the
desk for several hours cause there was a

219
00:13:12,371 --> 00:13:16,840
shootout across the street
and really? Yeah. Wow. Yeah,

220
00:13:16,841 --> 00:13:21,040
that was quite a Saturday.
Um, long story short,

221
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:25,300
so one day she was at the archives
flipping through some files when I came

222
00:13:25,301 --> 00:13:28,630
across some files on, uh, detention camp

223
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:33,513
[inaudible] detention camp

224
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:37,940
[inaudible] commit to you saying
come meet t k a m as in Mary,

225
00:13:37,941 --> 00:13:41,730
I t I and this was a Nairobi just
outside. And I remember okay.

226
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:46,010
And I said, Gosh, you know,
I know nothing about this.

227
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:50,690
So she calls over the archivist guy
named Evanson and I said, ever see?

228
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:53,690
Got Anything else like this? He
said, yeah, let me take a walk.

229
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:58,460
And then Evanson starts bringing me some
other files also related to committee,

230
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:03,140
very bureaucratic files. These pages
were filled with the, the details,

231
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:05,720
numbers of prisoners. A
lot of them were women,

232
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:09,650
well over a thousand because they would
mention a hundred of this and a couple

233
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:13,580
hundred of that. And at that
point I thought, what's going on?

234
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:17,810
So short time later she gets back to
Princeton and being the good little

235
00:14:17,811 --> 00:14:19,980
undergraduate history
major that I was, I just,

236
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,190
I searched high and low about
detention camps in Kenya. Nothing much,

237
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,170
no mention of this center any,

238
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:28,730
there's nobody who had done a
systematic study of it. Okay.

239
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,730
And that's what I was at.

240
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,290
So without anything else to go on,

241
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:40,190
Caroline just started driving up country
as they say, in the middle of nowhere.

242
00:14:40,191 --> 00:14:42,980
Kenya, all these tiny little
villages in the central province.

243
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:45,620
I mean really if you wanted to find
middle of nowhere on the map I was in it,

244
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:48,750
I would just show up at somebody who's
a little Shambo or farm one day and

245
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:52,643
[inaudible].

246
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,850
Next thing you know, I'm
conducting an interview.

247
00:14:55,910 --> 00:15:00,480
Can you ask her while working about
how many Hailey? No, these are tapes.

248
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,850
She recorded on a few of her trips.

249
00:15:01,851 --> 00:15:05,070
She would speak to people through her
research assistant, Terry Wirey Mu.

250
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:05,460
I mean,

251
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:08,510
some of these interviews go on for hours
than one interview begets the next.

252
00:15:08,511 --> 00:15:10,100
Every time you finish an
interview you say, you know,

253
00:15:10,101 --> 00:15:14,660
do you have somebody else who I
could talk to? [inaudible] they say,

254
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:18,080
Oh yeah, I've got my friend lives
three bridges up in four hills over.

255
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:19,550
So she would talk to that person.

256
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:23,000
[inaudible] and then the
person they referred to

257
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:27,920
[inaudible] and then person
they refer to to move in.

258
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,490
Like this is what she
did for like five years.

259
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,380
I went and interviewed
several hundred villagers.

260
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:38,870
And what exactly are they telling you? Um,

261
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:41,840
stories you can't imagine

262
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:45,523
[inaudible]

263
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:52,330
what the stories were, what those
stories have begun to unravel is up next.

264
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,273
[inaudible]

265
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:03,180
maybe do

266
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:08,563
that. What you mean?

267
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:22,203

268
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:35,880

Hey, I'm Jeff. I'm Ron and
I'm Robert Krulwich Radiolab.

287
00:17:59,371 --> 00:18:02,260
Before we get to the stories that
Caroline was referring to, um,

288
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,160
we should say that as we were
sort of reporting this story,

289
00:18:05,161 --> 00:18:09,540
we really kind of fell in deep,
uh, to the point where Jamie York,

290
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:13,620
who had already gone to London to get
hassled by those guards at Hansel Park,

291
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:17,070
he then decided to spend
part of his vacation

292
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:21,630
in Kenya, basically following
in Carolina Elkins footsteps.

293
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:25,740
Yes. And that's when he stumbled
into something kind of surprising.

294
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:30,950
So it got picked up early one morning
in Nairobi and driven about three hours

295
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:35,670
into the countryside and okay,
after what felt like five right?

296
00:18:35,671 --> 00:18:37,000
Turns 37 lefts.

297
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:40,980
We finally wind up in this
completely rural place.

298
00:18:40,981 --> 00:18:42,510
It really does feel like
the middle of the nowhere.

299
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:46,470
It's like a little
village or something. Yup.

300
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:49,890
Little cluster of houses and rolling
hills in a county called knee area. Okay.

301
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:54,420
Got My stuff. Got Out of the car, followed
Terry who uh, had arranged the trip.

302
00:18:54,421 --> 00:18:58,830
My name is [inaudible]. I am 41 years old.

303
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:02,380
This is the same Terry who translated
for Carolyn Elkins many years.

304
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,620
Anyhow, best a few kids

305
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:10,150
and Terry walks me into
this little clay hut.

306
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,310
There's a table in the center of the room,

307
00:19:12,311 --> 00:19:15,220
there's a handful of plastic
chairs around it and eventually

308
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:22,130
people start showing up. I'm good.
Here I am with women. You are gay.

309
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:26,530
Nine women who are all in their
late eighties early nineties.

310
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:37,340
I'm like [inaudible] making reductions
and honestly I'm a little bit

311
00:19:37,341 --> 00:19:39,380
disappointed because the Malmo,

312
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:42,800
I thought we're just men,

313
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:46,730
Jimmy fighters and seeing these
women. I thought, I don't know.

314
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:49,400
I realized most of the men
have died of old age. Oh,

315
00:19:49,401 --> 00:19:51,440
so you thought you were going
to meet anybody. Exactly.

316
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:55,130
How you curious for myself,
but I thought, okay, I'll just,

317
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:58,010
I'll just ask how many of them
are women? Like show of hands,

318
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:03,340
how many of you would identify as
Malmo at today about to give will be

319
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:08,560
instantaneously put their hand
up. All nine people. Yeah.

320
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:14,590
And then started to sort of chuckle if
I did fun that we asking them because

321
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:17,620
it's obvious to us are
putting Mama. They were like,

322
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:20,890
of course we were supporting the
Mama. We were, the was like that.

323
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:22,120
That was everybody.

324
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:25,090
Oh, interesting. So it wasn't just
like a small band of militants.

325
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:27,700
It wasn't a small band in
militants amongst the cuckoo you,

326
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:29,680
it was almost everyone.

327
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,810
This is one of the first things that
caught Carolina Elkins attention made her

328
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,880
really questioned that official narrative.

329
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:39,580
Cause when she was doing interviews
15 years ago, she says everyone,

330
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:44,520
she spoke to every one to a person and
we're talking hundreds of interviews

331
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:48,100
started with, I took the
oath on such and such a date.

332
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:49,323
Very interesting.

333
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:52,700
Seem to her. What you had here
was not a small insurrection.

334
00:20:52,701 --> 00:20:56,690
This was a mass movement and she would
discover that the British responds to,

335
00:20:56,691 --> 00:20:58,730
it was also massive.

336
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:04,520
1953 shortly after the murder of the
ruck family, the white settlers marched,

337
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:07,130
demanded that the colonial
government do something,

338
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:12,410
and so what happened is that the colonial
soldiers, they came to the village,

339
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:16,150
they started going to villages across
Kenya. They rounded everybody up, no joke,

340
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,530
slaughtered their cattle,
slaughter their goats,

341
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:22,460
burned down their homesteads and
put them into these prison villages,

342
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:27,170
some 800 barbwire villages
throughout central province, Kenya,

343
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:29,863
[inaudible].

344
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:36,350
The village was like a concentration camp.

345
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:36,920
The thing,

346
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:41,110
the thing to grasp here is that this
is very carefully designed and very

347
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,033
practical.

348
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:45,420
David says there was a very
carefully planned system at work.

349
00:21:45,421 --> 00:21:48,630
The barbwire villages were
primarily for women and children.

350
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:52,440
Men were usually sent to these detention
camps, which are basically prisons.

351
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:52,891
Now.

352
00:21:52,891 --> 00:21:57,891
The logic of those camps was actually
thought up by a group of British academics

353
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:02,810
who met in 1953 it's sort of an emergency
meeting to discuss the quote Mal mal

354
00:22:02,811 --> 00:22:07,770
problem and they decided at that meeting
that clearly the real reason the Malmo

355
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:08,740
are rebelling

356
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:11,890
was that they were captured by
some kind of mental illness.

357
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,660
Had nothing to do with the fact that
their land had been taken away from them.

358
00:22:14,661 --> 00:22:15,380
No, it was set.

359
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:19,280
They were temporarily crazy
and the committee decided
it must have something to

360
00:22:19,281 --> 00:22:20,800
do with those. Oh,

361
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:21,500
oh.

362
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:26,500
So was seen by the British as a primitive
way of capturing a cocoon mind and

363
00:22:27,411 --> 00:22:29,960
making the person
unreasonable and insensible.

364
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:34,730
The only way they argued you can get rid
of the oath was to convert the person

365
00:22:34,731 --> 00:22:39,440
back to sanity. Part of that involved
a confession of what they'd done.

366
00:22:40,370 --> 00:22:42,290
Once confessions were made,

367
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:45,380
they would then be rewarded
by a better prison regime.

368
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:49,880
Then we moved into another compound
given privileges, give them better food.

369
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,640
You moved along the system,
they called it a pipeline.

370
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:54,860
You would along the pipeline
until you were released,

371
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,450
but you first had to confess to a,

372
00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:00,840
to a confess to confers.

373
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:04,140
This is good to walk
Hungarian freedom fighter.

374
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:09,650
I joined as the Momo freedom
struggle when I was 17 years of age.

375
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:15,090
He quickly became an organizer,
recruiter and therefore a target.

376
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:20,130
They had to uh, such for
me and they caught me.

377
00:23:22,290 --> 00:23:24,390
They put me into a detention camp.

378
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:30,080
They want us to say
loudly that was for sick,

379
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:34,770
the mouse struggle but
refused. We refused.

380
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:41,580
In fact, one man told us the story of
how in one of the barbwire villages,

381
00:23:43,410 --> 00:23:46,880
every once in awhile [inaudible]
would come to the edge of the forest,

382
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:48,620
just outside the villages fence.

383
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:50,480
These were the fighters that
hadn't been captured yet.

384
00:23:50,481 --> 00:23:53,990
They'd come right to the edge of the
camp where a lot of the children would be

385
00:23:53,991 --> 00:23:58,710
playing. And because the
no [inaudible] does that,

386
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:01,100
anything about what was
happening in their country,

387
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:07,490
[inaudible] people in the village used
to use the children to take messages to

388
00:24:07,491 --> 00:24:10,220
the people in the foot,
the fighters in the forest.

389
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,190
That's how they pass food and
information to the fighters.

390
00:24:13,191 --> 00:24:16,130
And in a way kept things going.
The point is, according to David,

391
00:24:16,131 --> 00:24:20,540
that inside the camps you had massive
resistance and so in many cases the

392
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:22,910
British colonial soldiers
would double down.

393
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:28,050
Morning the following
is pretty graphic. Um,

394
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:32,670
there's a BBC documentary called
white terror that has tons of these

395
00:24:32,671 --> 00:24:35,970
frighteningly common stories
of abuse from detainees.

396
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:39,300
He told me how naked tied
by his feet to the bars.

397
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,150
He was brutally beaten on
the testicles with a stick.

398
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:44,440
One of them is a man giving
a tour of the prison cell.

399
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:46,360
He was kept in [inaudible].

400
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:51,550
Then they said his eyes with hot coals.
They kept him there for eight days.

401
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:55,760
There's another story of these three
men who were made to strip naked.

402
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:56,160
Well,

403
00:24:56,160 --> 00:25:00,280
one of the men who was made to put his
head into a bucket of water with the

404
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:02,393
[inaudible].

405
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:05,390
Then the white officer held one of the
prisoners legs aloft and when you're

406
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:07,700
smiling, God held the other Eh

407
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:13,110
[inaudible] and another
God brought some sand.

408
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,410
So they started to push into the
detainees anus with the stake

409
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:23,730
[inaudible] [inaudible] they kept on
doing this or trinity putting in sand and

410
00:25:23,731 --> 00:25:26,700
water. All the while pushing
the mixture in with the stack.

411
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:31,950
[inaudible] [inaudible] two
gives me nightmares to this day

412
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:36,780
because that was something that should
never be done to a human being. What

413
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:42,710
in that period of coercive violence,

414
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,380
it lasted throughout the 1950s

415
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:50,900
now the the moment we're bad guys, listen,

416
00:25:50,901 --> 00:25:53,420
there's nothing to excuse
this kind of terrorism,

417
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:58,040
but the Kenyan campaign was a
sledgehammer used to crack and not

418
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:01,190
[inaudible].

419
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:04,480
There've been a lot of different estimates
to try to pin down the scale of the

420
00:26:04,481 --> 00:26:09,220
British campaign. They range
from 160,000 people killed,

421
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:12,910
maim, torture, detained to
much, much higher numbers.

422
00:26:12,911 --> 00:26:17,410
Caroline outcomes did her own
calculations and according to her,

423
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,700
by the time it was done,

424
00:26:18,730 --> 00:26:23,230
nearly the entire Kikuyu population
of a million and a half people were

425
00:26:23,231 --> 00:26:28,210
detained, tortured, murdered,
systematize force labor.

426
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:33,870
And you have to look at scale and if
you are the balance sheet of this is how

427
00:26:34,541 --> 00:26:39,230
many Europeans died? 30 to 32 huh?

428
00:26:39,810 --> 00:26:44,250
Like, why isn't this a tale that everybody
in the world knows in the event, say

429
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:48,030
of the enslavement of the
Hebrew people under the Pharaoh,

430
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:51,600
they were slaves in Egypt. The
Pharaoh wouldn't let them out.

431
00:26:51,601 --> 00:26:52,680
Moses had to cross the river.

432
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:56,610
It becomes the national
story of the Hebrew people.

433
00:26:57,060 --> 00:27:00,830
In this situation, you have Jomo
Kenyatta who I believe is a cocoon.

434
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:05,730
You becoming the first president. Why
wouldn't he make this the national story?

435
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:06,653
Well,

436
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:11,160
Kenyatta comes out of detention and
one of the first things he does is he

437
00:27:11,161 --> 00:27:13,320
denounces Malmo as being hooligans.

438
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:17,430
The same organization that
accelerated independence in Kenya.

439
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:21,620
She says the same movement that scared
the British [inaudible] scared him. No,

440
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:24,720
he didn't want them suddenly
organizing and taking his power.

441
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:29,840
So for decades from 1948 until 2002 the
ban on Malmo that had been put in place

442
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:34,350
by the British corneal
government remained in place,

443
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,480
meaning it was illegal
to even talk about it

444
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:42,720
[inaudible].

445
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:47,100
But eventually in 2005 Caroline
publishes her book imperial reckoning,

446
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:50,490
which included the hundreds of interviews
and painted a picture of just a

447
00:27:50,491 --> 00:27:55,000
systemic violence. The
book was well received,

448
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:59,440
but she says a lot of critics
told her nice story, but

449
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:04,580
no, this is an act of fiction,
an act of fiction. I made it up,

450
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:06,410
but you had all these interviews, right,

451
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:11,420
but one of the lines of critique was
that it's all based upon oral testimony.

452
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:14,810
Oral testimonies aren't
usable. There is no story here.

453
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,780
She says a lot of that was
just blatant racism. You know,

454
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:20,690
Africans make up stories,
but buried in there

455
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:24,600
is sort of a legitimate concern.
I mean memory is faulty.

456
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:27,510
We know that oral histories
are notoriously unreliable.

457
00:28:27,511 --> 00:28:29,280
If you're going to
rewrite an entire history,

458
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:33,270
you need to get beyond personal
anecdote. You need documents.

459
00:28:36,930 --> 00:28:39,860
Let illustrate and prove it
beyond doubt. And as we mentioned,

460
00:28:39,861 --> 00:28:43,400
besides those few that you found,
the documents didn't seem to exist.

461
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:49,160
Nonetheless. Fast forward 2009 that book,

462
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:52,670
Caroline's imperial reckoning became
the basis of a very large lawsuit.

463
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:57,530
These Kenyan independent veterans have
in June of 2009 five mammo veterans

464
00:28:57,531 --> 00:29:00,440
representing over 5,000
mile mouth flew to London.

465
00:29:00,441 --> 00:29:04,370
The seat of an empire they say is
responsible for torturing them and filed a

466
00:29:04,371 --> 00:29:07,490
lawsuit against the British government
the first time the British government had

467
00:29:07,491 --> 00:29:10,010
ever been sued by a former
colonized population.

468
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:14,090
[inaudible] veterans want an apology
and some form of recompense for what

469
00:29:14,091 --> 00:29:16,970
happened. Are you at all
nervous going into the court?

470
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:19,160
I think the word nervous is
not the word I would have used.

471
00:29:19,161 --> 00:29:21,230
I tell my partners to write off the case.

472
00:29:21,290 --> 00:29:24,380
I was not at all convinced that
we're going to go anywhere but down,

473
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:25,281
but that's smart day.

474
00:29:25,281 --> 00:29:29,090
He represented the Malmo veterans in
court and the reason he was so sure that

475
00:29:29,091 --> 00:29:32,870
the case was going to go down
in flames was, well, same issue.

476
00:29:32,930 --> 00:29:34,850
You just didn't have the documents.

477
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:38,150
All he had were stories that
weren't exactly rock solid.

478
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:42,190
The eight was a nightmare. Old
Kenyans, their late seventies

479
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:43,720
and eighties first of all,

480
00:29:43,721 --> 00:29:47,860
most Africans in my experience
find dates extremely difficult,

481
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:50,920
but people in their seventies
and eighties almost impossible,

482
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:53,950
and this was actually a huge problem
because in the British system,

483
00:29:53,951 --> 00:29:57,310
if you're going to bring forward an old
case like one that's more than six years

484
00:29:57,311 --> 00:30:01,720
old, the key question to the judge
is, can you still get a fair trial?

485
00:30:01,810 --> 00:30:05,530
And the government can plausibly
argue, no, too much time has passed.

486
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,810
We were really worried that
the judge would say, well look,

487
00:30:07,811 --> 00:30:12,100
there can't be a fair trial because
actually these witnesses are so old,

488
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:13,450
so up and down,

489
00:30:13,451 --> 00:30:17,110
just in terms of their memories that
really their evidence is worth a great

490
00:30:17,111 --> 00:30:20,530
deal. So to recap, I
wasn't really optimistic,

491
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:22,870
but then it's kind of a last ditch effort.

492
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:25,270
He contacted historian David Anderson,

493
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:29,230
two dozen expert witness because David
had written a book about African history

494
00:30:29,231 --> 00:30:33,760
that was chocked full of legal documents
and they approached me to ask whether

495
00:30:33,761 --> 00:30:38,020
there was material in the legal cases
I dealt with that might be useful.

496
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:42,670
And that's when he told them something
that would ultimately lead all of us back

497
00:30:42,671 --> 00:30:46,630
to that scary building of secrets.
He told them for the past 20 years.

498
00:30:47,050 --> 00:30:51,730
He has had this hunch, well so long
before the mammo trial came to court,

499
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:57,660
I and a number of other
historians believed that
documents had been brought back

500
00:30:57,850 --> 00:30:59,080
from Kenya to Britain.

501
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:04,600
David says in that same Nairobi archive
were Caroline Elkins had found the

502
00:31:04,601 --> 00:31:06,490
document about detention
and thought, gosh,

503
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:09,400
you know what's going
on in that same place.

504
00:31:09,401 --> 00:31:12,550
Somebody else had found another document
that had also fallen through the

505
00:31:12,551 --> 00:31:13,020
cracks.

506
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:16,870
This one was a simple packing slip
listing of documents for transportation.

507
00:31:16,930 --> 00:31:20,320
I don't know if they're packing up and
removal as for where those documents were

508
00:31:20,321 --> 00:31:22,930
moved to. Well, no one knew. No.

509
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:27,990
Maybe to an incinerator or bottom of the
ocean bumped from 1990790890 nine like

510
00:31:28,361 --> 00:31:31,080
a starving man with a single
Pringle. David kept on.

511
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:34,750
I eventually bought documents from
the National Archives in Britain that

512
00:31:34,751 --> 00:31:38,880
confirmed the stuff from Kenya actually
landed in an airport in Britain on the

513
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:41,730
eve of independence. I then was
able to find out who took them,

514
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:44,680
which van they went in, even got
the college registration number,

515
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:48,030
but that's when the trail went cold.

516
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:52,050
They filed document requests after
document requests and we get nowhere.

517
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:57,230
Then something totally unexpected
happens to historians working on southern

518
00:31:58,801 --> 00:32:02,010
Africa actually got
access to Hounslow park.

519
00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:04,530
They got inside.

520
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:09,530
One of them was a former
colonial administrator,

521
00:32:09,531 --> 00:32:12,630
so he could work some connections
to get its way in any out.

522
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:17,750
Afterwards he sends David Anderson a
text message telling me the enhanced loop

523
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:23,061
park keeps seeing miles and miles of
shelving of documents from other colonies,

524
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:27,840
including Kenya. Was that a figure
of speech miles or was that a,

525
00:32:27,930 --> 00:32:29,400
I think he meant it literally.

526
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:35,800
So He'd seen a vast a hangar as he
described it with row upon row upon row of

527
00:32:36,261 --> 00:32:40,220
document. So when Martin Day,
the lawyer David Anderson

528
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:43,370
and asked him, can you help us
with it? Our case, David said,

529
00:32:44,150 --> 00:32:44,840
here's what I can do.

530
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:47,000
I can't actually give you any
documents because I don't have any,

531
00:32:47,001 --> 00:32:51,350
but I can outline for you the documents
that I think might be out there.

532
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:54,760
The documents. I believed the
British government were hiding away,

533
00:32:55,490 --> 00:32:58,550
so he wrote a witness report for the
judge summarizing everything he knew,

534
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:02,270
giving all the details I had, I
didn't mention Huntsville Park.

535
00:33:02,271 --> 00:33:03,650
I didn't say what I thought they were.

536
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:07,920
I just said I knew they'd
come into Britain and I want
you to know what happened

537
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:11,510
to them. The judge read that report
and then basically ask the government,

538
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:14,900
do you have them or not? Look, if
you can't answer this question,

539
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:18,050
you'll be held in contempt of
court. You'll be in another,

540
00:33:18,051 --> 00:33:20,810
which I will interpret this as you're
withholding information and that basically

541
00:33:20,811 --> 00:33:21,644
means you lose the case.

542
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:23,450
No,

543
00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:24,890
that decision was the turning point

544
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:31,060
half a century on from
Britain's withdrawal from
Kenya documents detailing the

545
00:33:31,061 --> 00:33:35,680
alleged brutality employed by the British
colonial authorities have finally been

546
00:33:35,681 --> 00:33:39,760
released and suddenly having spent years
denying these documents existed within

547
00:33:39,761 --> 00:33:40,710
four days, they found

548
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:45,970
Kenyans were waiting in my ruby
today for the news from London.

549
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:49,110
What are you going to see the
reaction of these people here?

550
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,440
Take one important battle here
today. I mean, we're talking,

551
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:56,100
we're talking something like
300 boxes of files, you know,

552
00:33:56,101 --> 00:34:00,450
tons of missing documents, 15,000
papers relevant to the case.

553
00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:02,620
This again is Katie Engelhart of vice new.

554
00:34:02,621 --> 00:34:06,720
She reported on the trial
and the extensive number of
files that the government

555
00:34:06,721 --> 00:34:10,920
produced a hundred linear feet. I
think those, those files held, um,

556
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:12,630
and they contained really,

557
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:16,560
really damning evidence of
Britain's conduct in Kenya.

558
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:20,340
The files made it clear that the central
government in London did know what was

559
00:34:20,341 --> 00:34:21,240
happening in Kenya.

560
00:34:21,241 --> 00:34:24,930
There was specific documentation
of rounding up of Malmo fighters.

561
00:34:25,290 --> 00:34:28,350
It was even a memo about a
Kenyon being roasted alive.

562
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:31,620
And there was this pleading letter written
by detainees up in smuggled out of a

563
00:34:31,621 --> 00:34:36,090
camp and it said, hurry, hurry, hurry.
In order to save our souls. I mean,

564
00:34:36,091 --> 00:34:37,590
absolutely damning evidence.

565
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:41,910
The government ultimately agreed to pay
about 20 million pounds to the people

566
00:34:41,911 --> 00:34:46,350
who brought this lawsuit, which
works out to roughly $4,600 each.

567
00:34:46,410 --> 00:34:51,330
Yes. Here's what I don't understand. Why
would they even save those documents?

568
00:34:51,650 --> 00:34:52,220
Well

569
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:55,070
looking through the collections
that have now emerged,

570
00:34:55,790 --> 00:35:00,790
it's quite clear to me that they wanted
to save documents that showed that not

571
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:08,060
all the European stuff in Kenya had
been happy about compulsive force.

572
00:35:08,370 --> 00:35:12,180
There's a letter written in 1953
by the colonies attorney general.

573
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:16,800
He observed that detention facilities
in Kenya or quote distressingly

574
00:35:16,801 --> 00:35:21,180
reminiscent of conditions in Nazi Germany
or communist Russia. Oh, interesting.

575
00:35:21,181 --> 00:35:22,740
So you think the people,

576
00:35:22,741 --> 00:35:27,510
some of the British officers in Kenya
Save the files precisely because they were

577
00:35:27,930 --> 00:35:28,420
damning.

578
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:32,830
Yes. They save stuff that would
demonstrate that we didn't like this

579
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:36,000
[inaudible]

580
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:36,833
whatever the reason.

581
00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:40,530
Here's why the memo cases become so
much bigger than just the Mal mal case.

582
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:43,590
As soon as journalists and historians
learned about the existence of those

583
00:35:43,591 --> 00:35:43,921
files,

584
00:35:43,921 --> 00:35:48,921
they started to relentlessly poke and
request more documents and soon those 1500

585
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:49,821
very soon,

586
00:35:49,821 --> 00:35:54,821
that became 8,800 files and then 20,000
files and then 1.2 million files and at

587
00:35:58,221 --> 00:36:02,900
the time the estimate was that the
files occupied about 15 miles a Florida

588
00:36:02,901 --> 00:36:06,140
ceiling shelving, what, 15 miles

589
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:10,200
the [inaudible] has been
invoked by the mammo case.

590
00:36:10,350 --> 00:36:14,760
Is going to have even wider
repercussions than people yet realize.

591
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,590
We got a little arrived in,

592
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:22,940
in just a little laughed of them when
we were talking with a woman named Mandy

593
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:25,850
Banton, a senior research
fellow at London University.

594
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,940
She used to work at the National Archives
in London and we called her just to

595
00:36:28,941 --> 00:36:31,040
help us parse all this stuff.
And at one point I asked her,

596
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:35,280
is this just the Kenya thing? And
she said, oh, no, no, no, it's not.

597
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:38,960
It's not by any means. Um, and she
explained that after the Mamao case,

598
00:36:38,961 --> 00:36:42,410
the Foreign Commonwealth Office, which
is the technical name for the place,

599
00:36:42,411 --> 00:36:45,500
it was holding those documents
almost immediately afterwards.

600
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:48,480
It admitted that he actually had, um,

601
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:52,210
documents from 37 former colonies.

602
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,340
Oh yes, exactly.

603
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:59,600
You mean that there could be
dirty stuff from Malaysia,

604
00:36:59,601 --> 00:37:02,850
dirty stuff from Palestine,
dirty stuff from Cypress?

605
00:37:02,851 --> 00:37:07,730
I believe the [inaudible] sort of
trouble spots if you like. I mean,

606
00:37:07,731 --> 00:37:10,460
this is like a rewriting of history
essentially is what you said,

607
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:14,450
ray writing of history. And I mean
there are now quite a lot of people.

608
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:19,130
I'm looking at these, you know,
comparatively newly released records now,

609
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:24,160
both David and Katie o cautioned us that
the new stuff when it comes out might

610
00:37:24,291 --> 00:37:28,900
not be quite as regulatory
as all those mammo files.

611
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:33,140
Well, I think there are nuggets. I
think there are nuggets and I think,

612
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:36,470
I mean I think historians will
find them for David Anderson,

613
00:37:36,530 --> 00:37:39,290
one of those nuggets might be
the documents about the Cold War.

614
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:43,730
Those could be historically really very,
very important for Caroline Elkins,

615
00:37:43,790 --> 00:37:44,900
Israel and Palestine.

616
00:37:44,901 --> 00:37:48,980
Then Malaya in Singapore and I want
to know is in those Hong Kong files,

617
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:53,120
there's over 250,000 documents
on Hong Kong, just Hong Kong,

618
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:57,620
which sort of brings us to the
situation that we are in now.

619
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:02,610
Just the most ridiculous, ridiculous,
stupid situation imaginable,

620
00:38:02,870 --> 00:38:06,690
which is that for the moment the
British government's policy is that all

621
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:10,090
[inaudible] documents must be
reviewed and redacted before release.

622
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:14,830
So each file needs to be looked over
by what's called a senior sensitivity

623
00:38:14,831 --> 00:38:17,590
reviewer, although
colloquially it's just weeders.

624
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:20,980
It's basically retired senior diplomats.

625
00:38:21,010 --> 00:38:26,010
If you can imagine you've got 15 miles
of papers and you've got literally a

626
00:38:26,830 --> 00:38:30,430
couple of dozen retired diplomats
and they sit in an office,

627
00:38:30,431 --> 00:38:33,560
literally turning pages, trying
to stay awake, sitting here.

628
00:38:33,590 --> 00:38:38,590
Just imagine like take little sip
tea and redact all day long sip,

629
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:40,653
redact,

630
00:38:40,810 --> 00:38:45,010
sip deck and at the rate that we're going,

631
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:47,230
by the time these files
finally see the light of day,

632
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:49,390
it will not be within my lifetime.

633
00:38:49,570 --> 00:38:52,080
I mean it could literally
be hundreds of years. I,

634
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:56,210
I keep thinking about these two groups
of elderly folks. Again, producer,

635
00:38:56,211 --> 00:38:59,810
Jamie York, the litigants and the Mama
case are in their eighties and nineties.

636
00:39:00,410 --> 00:39:04,610
It just strikes me that what
a crazy lucky break for them.

637
00:39:04,611 --> 00:39:09,140
That in the very final years
they're alive. They survive.

638
00:39:09,170 --> 00:39:12,410
To hear this apology from the British
government and acknowledgement of the

639
00:39:12,590 --> 00:39:15,140
story that had been
telling for 50 years. Well,

640
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:18,800
I find speculating there's
going to be so lucky. Yeah.

641
00:39:18,830 --> 00:39:23,830
Thank you for putting it that way because
I am having got to know the plaintiffs

642
00:39:23,961 --> 00:39:28,190
in the case. When they came to
London, it was very clear to me that,

643
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:29,510
um,

644
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:34,510
what mattered to these people was
not a financial settlement at all,

645
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:38,240
but rather acknowledgement,

646
00:39:39,850 --> 00:39:44,850
just simple acknowledgment that
these things had been done to them.

647
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:51,420
So on the day that the barrister for the
crown stood up in court and to all of

648
00:39:53,201 --> 00:39:55,810
our astonishment shed, quite simply,

649
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:58,600
the British government
admits the tortures.

650
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:03,250
Once I gathered my wix and looked
around and behind me in the court,

651
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:06,640
two of the plaintiffs were in tears

652
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:13,450
and it brought home to
me what a traumatic,

653
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:17,650
appalling experience this had been
for them from start to finish.

654
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:22,240
So yes, I agree for them to get
that triumph was remarkable,

655
00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:24,123
remarkable.

656
00:40:47,610 --> 00:40:47,920
[inaudible]

657
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,720
but since our producer, Jamie York,

658
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:53,560
it was really remarkable
only for some people. Yes.

659
00:40:54,550 --> 00:40:58,540
So w when I went to Kenya and I was
talking to these people who had lived

660
00:40:58,541 --> 00:40:59,680
through the emergency,

661
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:03,520
I wanted to know about what
they thought of the settlement

662
00:41:07,690 --> 00:41:11,190
[inaudible] [inaudible] and a lot of them
were like, what settlement thing? The,

663
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:16,230
they had a little mass about the
government of Britain having a green

664
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:19,270
[inaudible]. Some of them had heard
about it. Some of them hadn't.

665
00:41:19,271 --> 00:41:23,440
But it doesn't really matter to them
because the people that got paid,

666
00:41:23,441 --> 00:41:27,730
that's just a tiny sliver of the vast
majority of people who've suffered.

667
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:28,773
Who are you doing?

668
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:34,250
[inaudible] what this one guy
told me is that he and most

669
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:38,870
people, what they, what they want
need isn't so much an acknowledgement.

670
00:41:38,871 --> 00:41:41,810
It's, it's to get back
what was taken from them.

671
00:41:43,330 --> 00:41:46,620
[inaudible] pieces of land. Oh please.

672
00:41:46,850 --> 00:41:50,040
We one can keep some good cows.

673
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:56,420
[inaudible] so the Deacon do with
any 80 90 year old wants to do,

674
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,920
leave something behind Eh

675
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:05,870
[inaudible] to give their children
and black children a better life.

676
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:30,233
[inaudible] [inaudible]

677
00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:44,900
