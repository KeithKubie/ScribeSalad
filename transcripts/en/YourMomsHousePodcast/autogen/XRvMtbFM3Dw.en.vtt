00:34:17.740 --> 00:34:17.750
started getting scary we
 

00:34:17.750 --> 00:34:19.480
started getting scary we
referred to like I'll talk to other

00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:19.490
referred to like I'll talk to other
 

00:34:19.490 --> 00:34:22.510
referred to like I'll talk to other
people about it to about your model of I

00:34:22.510 --> 00:34:22.520
people about it to about your model of I
 

00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:24.340
people about it to about your model of I
feel like it's definitely one of like

00:34:24.340 --> 00:34:24.350

yeah so if I Lawrence Krauss in the
 

00:34:48.169 --> 00:34:50.050
yeah so if I Lawrence Krauss in the
studio who's a theoretical physicist I

00:34:50.050 --> 00:34:50.060
studio who's a theoretical physicist I
 

00:34:50.060 --> 00:34:52.149
studio who's a theoretical physicist I
have questions I want to ask him about

00:34:52.149 --> 00:34:52.159

is giant and then from there I feel like
 

01:19:37.830 --> 01:19:39.379
is giant and then from there I feel like
it's like that's the scaffolding that

01:19:39.379 --> 01:19:39.389
it's like that's the scaffolding that
 

01:19:39.389 --> 01:19:41.990
it's like that's the scaffolding that
you'll add jokes to you'll figure out a

01:19:41.990 --> 01:19:42.000
you'll add jokes to you'll figure out a
 

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:45.050

way to just do it the right way and for
 

01:19:47.820 --> 01:19:48.830
way to just do it the right way and for
me one of the things that I started

01:19:48.830 --> 01:19:48.840
me one of the things that I started
 

01:19:48.840 --> 01:19:50.330
me one of the things that I started
doing really recently that really made a

01:19:50.330 --> 01:19:50.340
doing really recently that really made a
 

01:19:50.340 --> 01:19:52.910
doing really recently that really made a
big difference is I'll have a bit even

01:19:52.910 --> 01:19:52.920
big difference is I'll have a bit even
 

01:19:52.920 --> 01:19:55.430
big difference is I'll have a bit even
if the bits killing and I know it DySP

01:19:55.430 --> 01:19:55.440
if the bits killing and I know it DySP
 

01:19:55.440 --> 01:19:57.530
if the bits killing and I know it DySP
it's going well just developing well I

01:19:57.530 --> 01:19:57.540
it's going well just developing well I
 

01:19:57.540 --> 01:19:58.660
it's going well just developing well I
will

01:19:58.660 --> 01:19:58.670
will
 

01:19:58.670 --> 01:20:01.100
will
outside of stand-up I'll sit in front of

01:20:01.100 --> 01:20:01.110
outside of stand-up I'll sit in front of
 

01:20:01.110 --> 01:20:02.660
outside of stand-up I'll sit in front of
my computer and just write on that

01:20:02.660 --> 01:20:02.670
my computer and just write on that
 

01:20:02.670 --> 01:20:05.180
my computer and just write on that
subject write on it in a completely

01:20:05.180 --> 01:20:05.190
subject write on it in a completely
 

01:20:05.190 --> 01:20:06.919
subject write on it in a completely
different way and like say if I approach

01:20:06.919 --> 01:20:06.929
different way and like say if I approach
 

01:20:06.929 --> 01:20:08.870
different way and like say if I approach
it from one like say like you're talking

01:20:08.870 --> 01:20:08.880
it from one like say like you're talking
 

01:20:08.880 --> 01:20:11.060
it from one like say like you're talking
about going on a boat you're approaching

about going on a boat you're approaching
 

01:20:11.070 --> 01:20:13.490
about going on a boat you're approaching
from this way then I'll just approach

01:20:13.490 --> 01:20:13.500
from this way then I'll just approach
 

01:20:13.500 --> 01:20:15.680
from this way then I'll just approach
from a completely different way and just

01:20:15.680 --> 01:20:15.690
from a completely different way and just
 

01:20:15.690 --> 01:20:17.390
from a completely different way and just
say okay well this is already in the can

01:20:17.390 --> 01:20:17.400
say okay well this is already in the can
 

01:20:17.400 --> 01:20:19.729
say okay well this is already in the can
this one's done alright I've got it

01:20:19.729 --> 01:20:19.739
this one's done alright I've got it
 

01:20:19.739 --> 01:20:21.140
this one's done alright I've got it
so let me just try a

01:20:21.140 --> 01:20:21.150
so let me just try a
 

01:20:21.150 --> 01:20:23.360
so let me just try a
to attack on it and I've come up with so

01:20:23.360 --> 01:20:23.370
to attack on it and I've come up with so
 

01:20:23.370 --> 01:20:24.830
to attack on it and I've come up with so
many different punch lines coming at it

01:20:24.830 --> 01:20:24.840
many different punch lines coming at it
 

01:20:24.840 --> 01:20:26.630
many different punch lines coming at it
from a different angle but forcing

01:20:26.630 --> 01:20:26.640
from a different angle but forcing
 

01:20:26.640 --> 01:20:28.370
from a different angle but forcing
myself to sit in front of the computer

01:20:28.370 --> 01:20:28.380
myself to sit in front of the computer
 

01:20:28.380 --> 01:20:30.230
myself to sit in front of the computer
yeah and you know I use that program

01:20:30.230 --> 01:20:30.240
yeah and you know I use that program
 

01:20:30.240 --> 01:20:31.910
yeah and you know I use that program
right room you ever showed you that

01:20:31.910 --> 01:20:31.920
right room you ever showed you that
 

01:20:31.920 --> 01:20:33.530
right room you ever showed you that
program blacks everything up blacks

01:20:33.530 --> 01:20:33.540
program blacks everything up blacks
 

01:20:33.540 --> 01:20:35.600
program blacks everything up blacks
everything out gives you green font so

01:20:35.600 --> 01:20:35.610
everything out gives you green font so
 

01:20:35.610 --> 01:20:37.460
everything out gives you green font so
it's like the matrix font yeah and I

01:20:37.460 --> 01:20:37.470
it's like the matrix font yeah and I
 

01:20:37.470 --> 01:20:39.770
it's like the matrix font yeah and I
just sit there and I can't access email

01:20:39.770 --> 01:20:39.780
just sit there and I can't access email
 

01:20:39.780 --> 01:20:42.170
just sit there and I can't access email
I don't get notifications nothing so

01:20:42.170 --> 01:20:42.180
I don't get notifications nothing so
 

01:20:42.180 --> 01:20:44.030
I don't get notifications nothing so
when you when you write from a different

01:20:44.030 --> 01:20:44.040
when you when you write from a different
 

01:20:44.040 --> 01:20:46.760
when you when you write from a different
angle will you then in your bit do the

01:20:46.760 --> 01:20:46.770
angle will you then in your bit do the
 

01:20:46.770 --> 01:20:48.740
angle will you then in your bit do the
chunk that works and then be like or

01:20:48.740 --> 01:20:48.750
chunk that works and then be like or
