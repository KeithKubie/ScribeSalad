00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.376
So why would I have you enter all those numbers for long division? Are we only

00:00:04.376 --> 00:00:08.667
concerned about the answer? Well, no. Math is about reasoning and we can use

00:00:08.667 --> 00:00:12.985
that reasoning in new situations like here. We'll use our understanding of

00:00:12.985 --> 00:00:17.531
dividing numbers to divide polynomials. To divide x plus 5 into x squared plus 7

00:00:17.531 --> 00:00:21.700
x plus 10, we're going to start with these first two terms. I want to think

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:27.076
about the expression that I could put here to multiply by x to get x squared. In

00:00:27.076 --> 00:00:33.603
other words, I'm taking x squared and dividing it by x. That variable must be x.

00:00:33.603 --> 00:00:39.502
Next, we multiply x by x and positive 5, and we get x squared plus 5x . This

00:00:39.502 --> 00:00:45.252
step was very similar to multiplying 2 times 4 to get the 8. Now that we're

00:00:45.252 --> 00:00:49.095
here, we want to subtract. So I want to subtract this entire amount or

00:00:49.095 --> 00:00:53.599
expression. This is really a negative 1 times each of these quantities. So we

00:00:53.599 --> 00:00:57.974
want to make sure that we change both of the signs. When I subtract the amount

00:00:57.974 --> 00:01:02.447
I'll have negative x squared and negative 5x. Both of the signs change. X

00:01:02.447 --> 00:01:07.798
squared minus x squared equals 0, and 7x minus 5x equals 2x. Next we bring down

00:01:07.798 --> 00:01:12.746
the ten to continue the next step of our long division problem. Now I want you

00:01:12.746 --> 00:01:17.677
to try that same process again. You're going to divide x plus 5 into 2x plus 10.

00:01:17.677 --> 00:01:22.615
What number would go here? And then when you multiply this number by x plus 5,

00:01:22.615 --> 00:01:27.884
what two expressions do you get here? Then you're going to subtract this

00:01:27.884 --> 00:01:31.959
quantity, and put in your final answers down here.
