&gt;&gt; MARCO: Hi, I'm Marco. I'm a multimedia
software engineer on the Android project and

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:09.519
I’d like to show you my favorite feature
of the music player. So, here I am listening

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:13.969
to some music in the music player and one
of the things I can do is click on the artist

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:21.029
name and a little pop-up comes up, I select
Amazon MP3 and I was searching the Amazon

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:31.060
MP3 store for albums by this artist. And here’s
the whole list of things that I can buy. Another

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:36.110
thing I can do is long press on the song name
and again, I’ll do an Amazon MP3 search

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:45.480
and it only finds one album but if I go over
the songs, you can see a whole list of songs,

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:55.450
remixes, karaoke mixes, tribute, groups, et
cetera. Another thing I can do is search for

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:05.230
Radiohead on Google, and from there, I can
go to the official Radiohead website, read

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:14.490
their Wikipedia entry, see their Myspace page,
et cetera. So, let’s pick a more recent

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:21.150
song. Now, I happen to know that this song
has a really cool video. So, I long press

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:28.460
on the title and I do a YouTube search.

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:35.180
And here it is, the first one and the music
stops playing. It’s loading the video and

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.979
now I'm watching the music video of the song
that I was just listening to.
