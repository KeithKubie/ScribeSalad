00:00:00.108 --> 00:00:01.801
- [Instructor] We've got the
equation Y plus two is equal

00:00:01.801 --> 00:00:04.446
to negative two, times X minus three.

00:00:04.446 --> 00:00:06.466
And, what I wanna do is figure out what

00:00:06.466 --> 00:00:10.464
is the slope of the line
that this equation describes?

00:00:10.464 --> 00:00:12.655
And there's a couple of ways
that you can approach it.

00:00:12.655 --> 00:00:14.291
What my brain wants to do is well,

00:00:14.291 --> 00:00:16.556
I know a few forms where it's easy

00:00:16.556 --> 00:00:17.989
to pick out the slope.

00:00:17.989 --> 00:00:19.096
For example, if I can manipulate

00:00:19.096 --> 00:00:21.293
that equation to be in the form Y

00:00:21.293 --> 00:00:24.543
is equal to MX plus B, well then I know

00:00:25.531 --> 00:00:28.486
that this M here, the
coefficient on the X term,

00:00:28.486 --> 00:00:31.245
well that's going to be my slope.

00:00:31.245 --> 00:00:34.952
And B is going to be my Y intercept,

00:00:34.952 --> 00:00:37.424
we cover that in many other videos.

00:00:37.424 --> 00:00:40.426
Another option is to get
into point-slope form.

00:00:40.426 --> 00:00:44.913
So the general framework
or the general template

00:00:44.913 --> 00:00:47.099
for point-slope form is,
if I have an equation

00:00:47.099 --> 00:00:50.766
of the form Y minus Y1
is equal to M times X

00:00:51.855 --> 00:00:54.091
minus X1, well then I immediately know

00:00:54.091 --> 00:00:56.378
that the line that this equation describes

00:00:56.378 --> 00:00:59.208
is going to have a slope of M once again.

00:00:59.208 --> 00:01:02.877
And here the Y intercept
doesn't jump out at you.

00:01:02.877 --> 00:01:04.558
Let me make sure you
can read this over here.

00:01:04.558 --> 00:01:06.915
The Y intercept doesn't jump out at you,

00:01:06.915 --> 00:01:09.884
but you know a point that is on this line.

00:01:09.884 --> 00:01:13.634
In particular, you know
that the point X1, Y1

00:01:15.343 --> 00:01:16.915
is going to be on this line.

00:01:16.915 --> 00:01:17.748
X1, Y1.

00:01:20.602 --> 00:01:22.410
So let's look at our original example.

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:23.880
So it might immediately jump out

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.325
at you that this is actually
in point-slope form.

00:01:27.325 --> 00:01:28.476
You might say, well okay, I see I have

00:01:28.476 --> 00:01:31.602
a minus X1, so X1 would be three,

00:01:31.602 --> 00:01:33.722
I have my slope here and
that answers our question,

00:01:33.722 --> 00:01:36.389
our slope would be negative two.

00:01:37.362 --> 00:01:41.399
But here it says plus two,
I have to subtract a Y1.

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:43.251
Well, you could just rewrite this,

00:01:43.251 --> 00:01:46.918
so it says, so you have
Y minus negative two

00:01:48.576 --> 00:01:51.729
is equal to negative
two times X minus three,

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:53.387
and then you see it's exactly

00:01:53.387 --> 00:01:55.643
this point-slope form right over here.

00:01:55.643 --> 00:01:59.191
So our slope right over
there is negative two,

00:01:59.191 --> 00:02:01.170
and then if I were to ask you,

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.165
well give me a point
that sits on this line,

00:02:03.165 --> 00:02:06.915
you could say, alright,
an X1 would be three,

00:02:07.813 --> 00:02:10.401
and a Y1 would be negative two.

00:02:10.401 --> 00:02:13.257
This point sits on the line,
it's not the Y intercept,

00:02:13.257 --> 00:02:14.593
but it's a point on the line and we know

00:02:14.593 --> 00:02:16.836
the slope is negative two.

00:02:16.836 --> 00:02:19.503
Now another way to approach this

00:02:20.424 --> 00:02:23.634
is to just manipulate it so that we get

00:02:23.634 --> 00:02:26.215
into slope-intercept form.

00:02:26.215 --> 00:02:28.721
So let's do that, let's manipulate

00:02:28.721 --> 00:02:31.852
it so we get into slope-intercept form.

00:02:31.852 --> 00:02:33.606
So the first thing my brain wants

00:02:33.606 --> 00:02:36.677
to do is distribute this negative two,

00:02:36.677 --> 00:02:39.536
and if I do that, I get Y plus two

00:02:39.536 --> 00:02:42.900
is equal to negative 2x, negative two

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.095
times negative three, plus six.

00:02:46.095 --> 00:02:49.762
And then I can subtract
two from both sides,

00:02:52.134 --> 00:02:56.301
and then I get Y is equal
to negative 2x plus four.

00:03:00.458 --> 00:03:03.508
And so here I am in
slope Y intercept form,

00:03:03.508 --> 00:03:06.116
and once again, I could
say, alright my M here,

00:03:06.116 --> 00:03:09.239
the coefficient on the
X term, is my slope.

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:11.921
So my slope is negative two.

00:03:11.921 --> 00:03:14.004
Let's do another example.

00:03:16.052 --> 00:03:19.442
So here, this equation
doesn't immediately go

00:03:19.442 --> 00:03:22.709
into either one of these
forms, so let's manipulate it.

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:24.052
And if it's in either one of them,

00:03:24.052 --> 00:03:26.212
I like to get into slope Y intercept form,

00:03:26.212 --> 00:03:29.080
it's a little bit easier
for my brain to understand.

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:30.497
So let's do that.

00:03:31.411 --> 00:03:34.828
So let us collect, well let's get the Xs,

00:03:36.503 --> 00:03:38.662
let's just isolate the Y
on the right-hand side,

00:03:38.662 --> 00:03:40.885
since the 2y is already there.

00:03:40.885 --> 00:03:43.635
So let's add three to both sides.

00:03:44.976 --> 00:03:47.194
I'm just trying to get rid
of this negative three.

00:03:47.194 --> 00:03:49.697
So if we add three to both sides,

00:03:49.697 --> 00:03:53.909
on the left-hand side we
have negative 4x plus 10

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:57.352
is equal to 2y, these cancel out.

00:03:57.352 --> 00:03:58.513
That was the whole point.

00:03:58.513 --> 00:04:00.523
And now to solve for Y, we just have

00:04:00.523 --> 00:04:03.073
to divide both sides by two.

00:04:03.073 --> 00:04:05.906
So if we divide everything by two,

00:04:06.863 --> 00:04:10.446
we get negative 2x plus
five is equal to Y.

00:04:12.992 --> 00:04:14.989
So this is in slope-intercept form.

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:16.701
I just have the Y on the
right-hand side instead

00:04:16.701 --> 00:04:17.904
of the left-hand side.

00:04:17.904 --> 00:04:21.125
We have Y is equal to mx plus B,

00:04:21.125 --> 00:04:22.782
and so our M is the coefficient

00:04:22.782 --> 00:04:24.748
on the X term right over here.

00:04:24.748 --> 00:04:29.105
So our slope is once
again, is negative two,

00:04:29.105 --> 00:04:30.728
and here our Y intercept is five,

00:04:30.728 --> 00:04:32.364
in case we wanted to know it.

00:04:32.364 --> 00:04:36.031
Let's do one more
example, one more example.

00:04:37.709 --> 00:04:42.631
Alright, so once again, this
is in neither slope-intercept

00:04:42.631 --> 00:04:45.175
or point-slope form to begin with,

00:04:45.175 --> 00:04:47.252
so let's just try to get
it to slope-intercept form.

00:04:47.252 --> 00:04:48.871
And like always, pause the video,

00:04:48.871 --> 00:04:51.698
and see if you can figure it out yourself.

00:04:51.698 --> 00:04:53.718
Alright, so let's get all the Ys

00:04:53.718 --> 00:04:55.682
on the left-hand side isolated,

00:04:55.682 --> 00:04:58.587
and the Xs on the right-hand side.

00:04:58.587 --> 00:05:01.494
So let me get rid of this negative 3x.

00:05:01.494 --> 00:05:04.327
So I'm gonna add 3x to both sides,

00:05:06.461 --> 00:05:08.768
and let's get rid of
this 3y right over here.

00:05:08.768 --> 00:05:12.156
So let's subtract 3y from both sides.

00:05:12.156 --> 00:05:14.022
You couldn't do this, I'm
doing two steps at once,

00:05:14.022 --> 00:05:15.027
but once again, I'm trying to get rid

00:05:15.027 --> 00:05:17.126
of this 3x, so I'm trying to get rid

00:05:17.126 --> 00:05:19.096
of this negative 3x, so I add 3x

00:05:19.096 --> 00:05:20.872
to the left, but I have
to do it to the right

00:05:20.872 --> 00:05:22.561
if I want to maintain the equality.

00:05:22.561 --> 00:05:24.748
And if I want to get rid of this 3y,

00:05:24.748 --> 00:05:26.150
well I subtract 3y from here, but I have

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:27.431
to do it on the left-hand side

00:05:27.431 --> 00:05:29.355
if I want to maintain the equality.

00:05:29.355 --> 00:05:31.001
So what do I get?

00:05:31.001 --> 00:05:34.743
That cancels out, 5y minus 3y is 2y,

00:05:34.743 --> 00:05:37.160
is equal to 2x plus 3x is 5x,

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:41.694
and then these two characters cancel out.

00:05:41.694 --> 00:05:44.594
And so if I want to solve for Y,

00:05:44.594 --> 00:05:48.873
I just divide both
sides by two and I get Y

00:05:48.873 --> 00:05:52.434
is equal to five halves X, and I'm done.

00:05:52.434 --> 00:05:53.855
And you mights say wait,
if this doesn't look

00:05:53.855 --> 00:05:55.644
exactly like slope-intercept form,

00:05:55.644 --> 00:05:57.401
where is my B?

00:05:57.401 --> 00:05:59.057
Well your B, if you wanted to see it,

00:05:59.057 --> 00:06:00.719
you could just write plus zero,

00:06:00.719 --> 00:06:03.197
B is implicitly zero right over here.

00:06:03.197 --> 00:06:06.030
So your slope, your slope is going

00:06:06.875 --> 00:06:09.010
to be the coefficient on the X term,

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:11.423
it's going to be five halves.

00:06:11.423 --> 00:06:12.762
And if you want to know your Y intercept,

00:06:12.762 --> 00:06:16.345
well it's zero, when X is zero, Y is zero.
