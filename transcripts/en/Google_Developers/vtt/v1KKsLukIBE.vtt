TOMER SHARON: Welcome everyone.

00:00:01.371 --> 00:00:04.470
We're going to talk today
about not listening to users,

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.590
about sampling their experience.

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:12.110
Three years ago, I started
working in a Google Search.

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:15.480
Before that I worked in an
Ads for 2 and 1/2 years,

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.920
and we started getting more and
more interested in what people

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.890
want to know,
because what you saw

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:28.950
in the video is what people
actually do on Google.

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:30.490
Of course it's a
parody, but this

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:32.040
is what people actually do.

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.270
We wanted to know what
they want to know,

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:36.540
with or without
connection to Google.

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.250
So a team came to me and
we started planning this,

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.450
and since then we've
been doing a study that's

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:47.710
we call internally DIN that
stands for Daily Information

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:48.870
Needs.

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.480
And this has been going
on since then in the US

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.410
and in other countries
around the world.

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:00.300
What we pretty much ask
our study participants

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.790
is this question-- what did
you want to know recently?

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:06.580
And we ask this
question over and over

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.810
again during a few days.

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.880
And we ask a lot of people,
we ask this question.

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.930
We even have t-shirts
for the DIN project

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:16.450
internally at Google.

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:17.690
Hi, my name is Tomer Sharon.

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.400
I'm a Google Search user
experience researcher,

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.570
and today we're going to
talk about a method called

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.320
Experience Sampling.

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.750
The problem, I want to
start and talk a few minutes

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.410
about the problem that we have.

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:36.710
The problem is that
people listen to users.

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:41.880
What I call is to not
listen to people's opinions

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.520
or ask them any question
about the future.

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.020
Would you use something?

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:52.270
Instead, I call for
observing behavior.

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.950
And I want to talk a
little bit about why.

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.000
I don't listen to
users because of what

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.750
I know about the psychology
of the difference

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.020
or the relationship between
attitude and behavior.

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.180
Attitude is what
people say they do

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:10.820
and behaviors is what
they actually do.

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:12.300
Here's one study.

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.750
This was done in 1937.

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:20.290
The researcher went into
classrooms and asked students,

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.300
would you cheat in an exam?

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:24.490
And they answered.

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:28.090
A few weeks after that, got
back to the same students

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.310
and together with
the teachers, they

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.080
were giving these students
an opportunity to cheat

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.280
without them knowing that
they're being tracked.

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.440
And surprise,
surprise, there was

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.790
close to zero correlation
between what people said

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.780
about their future behavior
and their actual behavior.

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.340
This was 1937.

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.540
That's 77 years ago.

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.840
Here's something from 2012.

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.380
Researchers in the
UK-- and this was

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.510
done with dozens of
thousands of people

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:07.460
in the UK-- went into public
bathrooms in gas stations

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:09.980
all over the country,
and they asked

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.230
people coming out
of the bathroom

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.540
did you wash your hands after
you finish your business?

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.050
And 99% of people said yes.

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:25.520
However, they also installed
electronic recording devices

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.670
inside the bathrooms,
and they actually

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.180
counted how many people
wash their hands.

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:36.260
And again, 32% of
men and 64% of women

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.580
really did wash their hands.

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:41.700
Now there are many reasons
why this is happening.

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.490
Lying is not one of them.

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:50.280
OK, usually people are
not intentionally lying

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.460
about their behavior.

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:55.800
We're just very bad
at predicting it.

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:59.000
Now I want to take you
into the start-up world.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.210
I've been interviewing a lot of
people in the start-up world,

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:08.370
and what I found is this.

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.060
This is the main finding--
entrepreneurs have no time

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.220
or budget to spend on
learning from users.

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.399
This is what I observed.

00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:20.750
And I interviewed 150
start-up founders and VCs

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:25.100
because I was so surprised by
what I heard from start-ups,

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:28.760
and I also talked with VCs
and I was even more depressed.

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:32.860
But, I want to share the
other primary findings

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:34.790
from these interviews.

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:40.800
Only 12% of them knew
what is user experience.

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.090
And I was very generous.

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:45.660
I asked them a direct
question-- in your opinion, what

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:47.700
is the definition
of user experience?

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:49.730
And they gave me their answer.

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:53.160
I was very generous in
evaluating their responses,

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.630
and even after this
generosity only 12% of them

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:58.980
really knew, defined
it very well.

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:03.950
Another finding--
a start-up idea

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:06.870
is born from a
founder's personal pain.

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:09.810
86% of start-up founder's
start their start-up

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:12.600
because they had a problem.

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:18.350
OK, now it's not necessarily a
bad thing, it's just a finding.

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:20.590
It could be bad if
they're convinced

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:23.320
that the entire world
has this problem.

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:26.040
In many cases, they are
convinced that this is so.

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:34.920
I also asked what
are other reasons

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:36.756
that you started your start-ups.

00:05:36.756 --> 00:05:37.630
This is what I found.

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:40.280
So personal pain, 86%.

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:43.490
And user research is
down there with 2%,

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:48.290
meaning that they did research
to identify user needs,

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:51.690
and then they came up with an
idea based on what they found.

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:53.120
In between, spin off.

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:56.150
They started a company and
then pivoted or changed it

00:05:56.150 --> 00:06:00.540
completely or started a new
company based on what they did.

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:03.200
Requests from clients,
clients came to them

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:06.860
and ask them for something
and they started a company,

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:09.960
or they read market
research reports.

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:13.230
But the main result
here is that it's solely

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:14.980
based on personal pain.

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:21.500
What I saw is that
ideas are mostly

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:24.530
for products or services.

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:31.570
There was close to 0% of
the people I interviewed

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:35.680
who thought about a
problem, a problem to solve,

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:36.840
and started with this.

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:43.140
Here's a company that
didn't think about a problem

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:45.660
before they started, and
you can clearly see that.

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:49.640
Who knows what this is,
except for that it's a phone.

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:51.160
Yeah.

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:53.450
It's a jitterbug phone.

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:57.280
What's special about
the jitterbug phone?

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:01.310
It's for older people who
have a hard time reading.

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:01.970
I agree.

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:05.590
It's even more than just
a hard time reading.

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:08.170
They have big buttons here.

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:11.030
It's not the size of the phone,
but it's not far from it.

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:13.570
It's really, really big.

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:16.050
The letters, the
font is really big.

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:18.330
There's this cover here.

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:22.890
All of this-- can you think
why they're doing this?

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:25.470
Why are all these
special features?

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:26.875
What is the prior knowledge?

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:31.580
A phone for complete novices.

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:35.490
They don't know--

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:35.990
[INAUDIBLE]

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:43.860
They have no need or concept
of modern smart phones, yes.

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:46.469
AUDIENCE: They have
real physical needs--

00:07:46.469 --> 00:07:48.260
TOMER SHARON: They have
real physical needs

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:51.140
for different types
of interfaces.

00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:52.940
Why?

00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:57.830
I argue that there is,
for every new product,

00:07:57.830 --> 00:08:00.510
there's prior
knowledge that people

00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:04.220
apply to using this new product.

00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:06.660
What is the prior
knowledge of elderly people

00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:09.598
when they use this?

00:08:09.598 --> 00:08:12.040
[INAUDIBLE]

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:12.870
That's a problem.

00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:13.870
What is their knowledge?

00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:16.610
[INAUDIBLE]

00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:17.750
Push button land line.

00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:22.130
I would go even further back.

00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:24.400
This is their prior knowledge.

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:26.200
Now let's compare these.

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:27.075
Big font.

00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:32.190
And there's a thing--
how many of you

00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:36.295
saw elderly people use
a smartphone like this?

00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:41.669
You saw that?

00:08:41.669 --> 00:08:42.799
That's for a reason.

00:08:42.799 --> 00:08:44.906
That's the reason.

00:08:44.906 --> 00:08:46.030
Because it worked this way.

00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:48.590
It reached their mouth and ear.

00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:50.240
And this is what they did here.

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:54.160
This cover here,
this grey cover here,

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:57.990
is to block the noise exactly as
you could have done with this.

00:08:57.990 --> 00:08:59.940
And there are
other features that

00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:01.554
are just easier
for people to use.

00:09:01.554 --> 00:09:02.970
It's not based on
prior knowledge,

00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:06.910
but it's based on knowledge
that they don't have.

00:09:06.910 --> 00:09:11.720
Everything here is
yes/no questions.

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:16.920
They type, they dial the number,
and then it asks them, call?

00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:19.830
And there are two
yes no buttons.

00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:22.340
So it's all very kind
of conversational.

00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:24.860
So they don't need to
understand if you remember

00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:27.550
the buttons back then--
send, end, or figure out

00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:31.190
different icons
and what they mean.

00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:34.540
So this is based
on fundamentally

00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:38.280
understanding a problem.

00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:40.890
These are the questions
app developers and startup

00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:42.740
founders ask themselves.

00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:45.450
These are great questions
that they ask themselves.

00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:47.460
97% ask who are my customers.

00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:52.370
95% ask a critical question--
do people need my product?

00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:55.550
And 89% ask if the
product is usable

00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:57.905
or not, and other questions.

00:10:01.390 --> 00:10:05.140
But this is the problem--
the way people answer

00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:08.560
their great questions
is extremely

00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:11.160
invalid and
unreliable, and I want

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:15.360
to share some of these answers,
and some of them are funny

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:19.270
but they well
represent the answers I

00:10:19.270 --> 00:10:22.790
got in 150 interviews.

00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:24.120
Who are my customers?

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:27.720
The way they answer it is
analytics and assumptive

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:28.850
personas.

00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:31.220
They invent personas.

00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:33.090
Inventive personas
are personas that

00:10:33.090 --> 00:10:38.190
are based on nothing, based
on intuition not on research.

00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:42.200
Analytics, they go
through demographics

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:46.520
and this is how they know
who their customers are.

00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:47.790
Do people need my product?

00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:50.730
Again a critical
question, and there

00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:52.560
are ways to answer
it with research.

00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:55.050
This is how the answer
it, and I'm not kidding.

00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:01.820
Is the product usable?

00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:04.150
We focus on UX.

00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:07.180
We really, really, really,
really focus on UX,

00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:09.690
meaning that it's good.

00:11:09.690 --> 00:11:11.980
We use it ourselves
is another answer.

00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:16.660
We know if it's usable or not.

00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:19.310
We need the founders,
we the company.

00:11:19.310 --> 00:11:21.960
Is our product better
than the competition?

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:24.410
After a 10 minute argument
that they have no competition

00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:26.201
and me saying that they
do have competition

00:11:26.201 --> 00:11:29.010
without even knowing them,
they agree and answer,

00:11:29.010 --> 00:11:30.320
we do things differently.

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:32.740
We can't compare.

00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:36.500
And if we can compare,
we compare feature lists.

00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:39.110
We look at the
competitions website

00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:41.210
and we see a long
list of features.

00:11:41.210 --> 00:11:47.440
We compare it to ours and
then we know who's better.

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:50.500
Is our product getting better?

00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:53.910
We improve it all
the time, so yes.

00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:55.410
And do people want the product?

00:11:55.410 --> 00:11:57.700
Which is, by the way, a
question I'm not really

00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:00.110
suggesting you ask
because what people want

00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:01.060
doesn't really matter.

00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:03.010
What matters is what they need.

00:12:03.010 --> 00:12:05.140
And it's always different.

00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:08.250
And I kid here, but
this is what they

00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:12.000
do-- they ask friends
and family members.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.210
And friends and family
members are very nice to you.

00:12:15.210 --> 00:12:17.140
They want you to succeed.

00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:18.420
But they're really biased.

00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:22.500
So that's a problem.

00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:24.340
All of this means
one thing-- that's

00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:27.390
a huge risk that they're taking.

00:12:27.390 --> 00:12:30.440
A huge risk.

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:33.860
He's not going to
catch him, right?

00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:35.460
And these start-ups
develop products

00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:38.650
that nobody, nobody needs.

00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:41.660
And they're executing
the wrong plan.

00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:43.020
You, you came here.

00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:46.290
I know you never do that, right?

00:12:46.290 --> 00:12:49.710
But just in case you do,
I want to introduce you

00:12:49.710 --> 00:12:52.990
to Experience Sampling.

00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:55.900
Experience Sampling is what's
called a strategic research

00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:57.650
technique, and it's
strategic because it's

00:12:57.650 --> 00:12:59.510
looking at uncovering
user needs.

00:12:59.510 --> 00:13:02.480
It's not evaluating
a product or a design

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:03.440
that we currently have.

00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:10.150
So in the DIN project,
what we did is this:

00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:13.940
we asked people the same
question over and over again,

00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:17.560
what did you want
to know recently?

00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:22.100
And we saw this-- I
can't share the data

00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:24.260
and the size doesn't
really represent the data,

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:29.450
but we have two
parts of answers.

00:13:29.450 --> 00:13:32.080
One part is what
people search on Google

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:34.240
that they shared with us.

00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:36.600
And there's another
part of what people

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:39.245
want to know that Google
can't give them today.

00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:43.710
And these are two examples.

00:13:43.710 --> 00:13:47.390
What they do on Google is things
like-- not just of course,

00:13:47.390 --> 00:13:49.350
but-- Barack Obama height.

00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:51.900
And Google is very
good with thousands

00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:56.620
of types of questions
or queries such as that.

00:13:56.620 --> 00:14:00.020
But they also want to know for
example, what type of writer

00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:01.510
am I?

00:14:01.510 --> 00:14:05.250
Google can't give
this to them today.

00:14:05.250 --> 00:14:08.630
So all of this, what people
want to know that they can't

00:14:08.630 --> 00:14:12.800
do today, is an
opportunity for us.

00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:16.180
And this is extremely
indicative of user needs.

00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:22.260
Experience Sampling is
a research technique

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:26.250
where you interrupt
people's daily lives

00:14:26.250 --> 00:14:30.030
and ask them to note it,
note their experience

00:14:30.030 --> 00:14:31.060
about something.

00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:34.100
In our case, this was what
did you want to know recently.

00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:42.490
It's very good for identifying
needs, for understanding what

00:14:42.490 --> 00:14:46.900
features people need--
OK, not comparing feature

00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:50.959
lists to competition-- and for
uncovering current pain points

00:14:50.959 --> 00:14:51.500
and delights.

00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:56.360
Here are the ingredients.

00:14:56.360 --> 00:15:00.410
This is what you need to do
to run an Experience Sampling

00:15:00.410 --> 00:15:03.580
study, and it's not really hard.

00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:06.820
First, you need to
very carefully think

00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:08.900
about the question
that you're asking.

00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:11.060
It's really, really important.

00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:13.490
Again in our example,
we asked, what

00:15:13.490 --> 00:15:15.440
did you want to know recently?

00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:18.190
We also asked-- this
was the lead question.

00:15:18.190 --> 00:15:20.830
We also asked some
more questions.

00:15:20.830 --> 00:15:22.630
For example, why?

00:15:22.630 --> 00:15:25.600
Because some
answers, we learned,

00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:27.180
are not really telling us a lot.

00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:30.200
I'm going to give a
few examples later.

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:33.380
We also ask people for example.

00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:37.770
If a picture better explains
your answer, take a picture

00:15:37.770 --> 00:15:39.312
and send it to us.

00:15:39.312 --> 00:15:41.770
And so on and so forth, and we
asked a few other questions.

00:15:41.770 --> 00:15:42.925
Were you with other people?

00:15:42.925 --> 00:15:45.070
Or who needed the information?

00:15:45.070 --> 00:15:46.170
And so on and so forth.

00:15:49.010 --> 00:15:53.440
Generally speaking, we
planned each notification

00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:55.590
to take about one
minute to answer--

00:15:55.590 --> 00:15:58.440
not about-- up to
one minute to answer.

00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:01.460
Because otherwise
people feel overwhelmed.

00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:04.730
We asked a question, I don't
know, 5, 8 times a day.

00:16:04.730 --> 00:16:06.650
If it's a burden, they
won't participate.

00:16:09.650 --> 00:16:13.070
Now there's a question-- how
many times do I ask them?

00:16:13.070 --> 00:16:16.160
It depends on how
many answers you want.

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:20.850
And it depends on the activity
that you're looking at.

00:16:20.850 --> 00:16:24.950
So for example, if it's what
did you want to know recently,

00:16:24.950 --> 00:16:27.700
I claim that people
want to hundreds, maybe

00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:30.760
thousands of things
during a typical day.

00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:34.720
We only asked a
question 5 or 8 times.

00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:38.600
But if it's what was
the reason you recently

00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:43.180
updated your website, that might
not happen several times a day.

00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:48.540
So you need to kind of do
some reverse mathematics,

00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:50.180
and start with how
many answers you

00:16:50.180 --> 00:16:51.530
want by the end of the study.

00:16:51.530 --> 00:16:57.260
Let's say you want
2,500 answers and then

00:16:57.260 --> 00:16:58.280
you can start dividing.

00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:00.700
Let's say you have
100 participants

00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:02.710
and then you decide
that, OK I'm going

00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:05.619
to send it to them 5
times a day for 5 days.

00:17:05.619 --> 00:17:07.760
Then you get to 2,500.

00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:09.869
Of course some of them
will be garbage and things

00:17:09.869 --> 00:17:14.849
you don't understand, but
this is how you calculate it.

00:17:14.849 --> 00:17:16.829
Carefully choose a medium.

00:17:16.829 --> 00:17:20.470
Text messaging, email,
an app, a phone message.

00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:25.410
You can call them, or ask
them to call you and leave

00:17:25.410 --> 00:17:27.130
a message.

00:17:27.130 --> 00:17:29.730
These are all valid ways.

00:17:29.730 --> 00:17:34.300
The primary thing you need to
do you think about in advance

00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:36.640
is, how are you going
to collect the data?

00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:39.760
Because if it's a text
message that you then

00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:43.450
need to copy and paste
into a spreadsheet,

00:17:43.450 --> 00:17:46.670
that's not going to work
with 2000 responses.

00:17:46.670 --> 00:17:50.800
So think of a good
way to do that.

00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:53.480
Ask them to fill a form with
one question or something

00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:55.680
like that, and then it
goes into a spreadsheet.

00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:58.520
Or if you are more
capable, you can

00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:02.410
use [INAUDIBLE] if you heard
about it, and things like that.

00:18:02.410 --> 00:18:03.830
But think about it in advance.

00:18:03.830 --> 00:18:08.530
Don't find yourself copying
and pasting 2000 responses.

00:18:08.530 --> 00:18:09.980
We used Paco.

00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:15.320
Paco is an app, an
Android app for sure.

00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:17.650
I'm not sure if there's
an iOS version yet.

00:18:17.650 --> 00:18:21.130
I know they're working
on it or worked on it.

00:18:21.130 --> 00:18:22.430
Publicly available.

00:18:22.430 --> 00:18:26.179
Paco goes stands for
Personal Analytics Companion,

00:18:26.179 --> 00:18:28.095
and also the name of the
dog of the developer.

00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:34.260
It's an app that allows us to
send notifications and manage

00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:39.220
this whole Experience
Sampling process really easy.

00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:42.780
Decide how to collect the
data in a spreadsheet,

00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:45.140
or something like that.

00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:47.330
Now participants.

00:18:47.330 --> 00:18:50.660
I mentioned 100
participants in general.

00:18:50.660 --> 00:18:52.650
You need to carefully
think about participants

00:18:52.650 --> 00:18:54.233
and what you're going
to do with them.

00:18:54.233 --> 00:18:56.300
How many, we talked about that.

00:18:56.300 --> 00:19:01.330
Expectations-- they need to
know what you expect of them.

00:19:01.330 --> 00:19:03.290
You need to brief them.

00:19:03.290 --> 00:19:04.420
Not too much you.

00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:06.660
You don't want to give
them examples of answers,

00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:09.750
because this way you're only
going to get these examples.

00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:14.070
Stay vague with regards to
what you want them to share

00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:18.350
or how you want them
to answer, but do

00:19:18.350 --> 00:19:22.250
explain that you expect
them to answer each time

00:19:22.250 --> 00:19:25.880
and to answer all of the
questions that you ask.

00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:27.660
And answer the
question in a way that

00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:31.350
will make you understand
what they mean.

00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:33.190
Practice.

00:19:33.190 --> 00:19:34.920
A couple of days
before the study,

00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:39.310
send the question once
and see what you get.

00:19:39.310 --> 00:19:42.790
And if there are participants
who are not really giving you

00:19:42.790 --> 00:19:45.420
what you want, work
with them on that.

00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:47.190
Give them an incentive.

00:19:47.190 --> 00:19:49.770
An incentive-- at Google we pay.

00:19:49.770 --> 00:19:54.590
But we have money to pay and I
know a lot of small companies

00:19:54.590 --> 00:19:56.280
don't have the money to pay.

00:19:56.280 --> 00:20:02.120
To them I say incentive
is not necessarily money.

00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:04.210
If you're a start-up,
a small start-up,

00:20:04.210 --> 00:20:07.170
if you have an
office, create a wall

00:20:07.170 --> 00:20:10.340
of fame of people who
helped us with research.

00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:11.782
Put their names on it.

00:20:11.782 --> 00:20:13.240
Take a picture and
send it to them.

00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:15.540
People love their name.

00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:17.390
That would be a great incentive.

00:20:17.390 --> 00:20:21.020
If you don't have an
office, have a web page

00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:24.830
for that, the wall fame
of study participants

00:20:24.830 --> 00:20:26.380
who helped us on your site.

00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:31.750
The moment you're
thinking about research

00:20:31.750 --> 00:20:33.990
in general and Experience
Sampling specifically

00:20:33.990 --> 00:20:36.550
because it involves a
lot of participants,

00:20:36.550 --> 00:20:38.220
start recruiting them.

00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:40.640
Find them, start finding them.

00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:41.744
There are ways to do that.

00:20:41.744 --> 00:20:43.160
I'm not going to
describe that now

00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:45.550
because it's going
to take a while,

00:20:45.550 --> 00:20:48.640
but start recruiting
your participants as

00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:49.720
soon as possible.

00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:52.400
Recruiting, finding people
to participate in research

00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:54.060
is the biggest
bottleneck of research.

00:20:57.890 --> 00:20:59.140
Let's talk about the analysis.

00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:01.434
We talked about how we
collect the data, who we do it

00:21:01.434 --> 00:21:02.850
to with and what
you do with them.

00:21:02.850 --> 00:21:05.460
Let's talk a little
bit about the analysis.

00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:09.710
So you need to
decide on categories

00:21:09.710 --> 00:21:11.530
that you're going to
classify the data.

00:21:11.530 --> 00:21:14.610
So imagine you're
getting 2000 responses

00:21:14.610 --> 00:21:16.530
and we need to do
something with them.

00:21:16.530 --> 00:21:21.690
What you do is classified them
into different categories.

00:21:21.690 --> 00:21:23.820
We had-- in the Daily
Information Needs study,

00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:25.780
we had 40 plus categories.

00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:31.390
Before we even started, we
defined with real specifics,

00:21:31.390 --> 00:21:32.980
what are the
categories and what are

00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:37.050
the options in each category.

00:21:37.050 --> 00:21:39.490
Let's say, let's
take an example.

00:21:39.490 --> 00:21:43.300
Let's say this is our Experience
Sampling question: what

00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:47.760
frustrated you the last time
you went grocery shopping?

00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:51.800
So here are some categories.

00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:54.550
So location could
be one category.

00:21:54.550 --> 00:21:56.500
Where the frustration
took place,

00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:59.360
and options might
be the ones you

00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:02.280
see here-- home, way to from
store, in car, parking lot,

00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:03.940
and at store.

00:22:03.940 --> 00:22:07.740
Another category would
be close people, friends

00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:09.740
and family who
might be involved.

00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:12.540
Spouse, roommate, kids.

00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:15.080
Another one would be
people at the store.

00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:18.935
So you look at each
response and you classify it

00:22:18.935 --> 00:22:20.220
by these categories.

00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:22.450
I'm going to show you how
you do that in a second.

00:22:22.450 --> 00:22:25.360
So people at the store could
other customers, cashier,

00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:28.440
store service personnel,
and so on and so forth.

00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:29.800
And what was the issue?

00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:32.920
Finding items, understanding
costs, and long lines.

00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:34.780
This is just an example.

00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:37.960
So what you do with
it, you classify

00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:39.240
each and every response.

00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:42.400
Let's say this is
one of the responses.

00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:44.059
OK.

00:22:44.059 --> 00:22:44.850
I asked a question.

00:22:44.850 --> 00:22:48.050
What frustrated you in your
recent grocery shopping

00:22:48.050 --> 00:22:48.822
experience?

00:22:48.822 --> 00:22:49.780
And this is one answer.

00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:53.530
A slow cashier combined
with an elderly person

00:22:53.530 --> 00:22:55.580
was in front of me
on the line caused

00:22:55.580 --> 00:22:58.330
me to be late to pick
up my son from school.

00:22:58.330 --> 00:23:00.350
All right, so how do
you classify that?

00:23:00.350 --> 00:23:02.960
So the location is at the store.

00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:04.770
Close people are kids.

00:23:04.770 --> 00:23:08.080
People at the store are other
customers and the cashier,

00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:10.930
and the issue was long lines.

00:23:10.930 --> 00:23:14.840
So you kind of disassemble
each and every response

00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:15.785
into its components.

00:23:19.810 --> 00:23:24.230
As you do that, you learned
that your pre-defined categories

00:23:24.230 --> 00:23:25.540
are not so good.

00:23:25.540 --> 00:23:26.940
Sometimes you need
to merge them,

00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:28.350
sometimes you need
to split them,

00:23:28.350 --> 00:23:30.050
sometimes you need
to create new ones,

00:23:30.050 --> 00:23:32.750
sometime you need
to get rid of a few.

00:23:32.750 --> 00:23:36.700
That's fine, do that.

00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:39.520
Clean the data as you go.

00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:42.620
"Dogs" is an answer we
got to the question what

00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:44.830
did you want to know recently.

00:23:44.830 --> 00:23:46.730
We have no idea
what "dogs" mean.

00:23:49.270 --> 00:23:51.620
So you need to clean this data.

00:23:51.620 --> 00:23:54.460
This is an answer to the
frustration at the grocery

00:23:54.460 --> 00:23:56.940
store question.

00:23:56.940 --> 00:24:00.710
It has nothing to do with what
you need, so clean that data.

00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:01.549
And generate-- what?

00:24:01.549 --> 00:24:02.590
AUDIENCE: She needs help.

00:24:02.590 --> 00:24:04.570
TOMER SHARON: She
needs help, yes.

00:24:04.570 --> 00:24:05.960
Yes.

00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:08.260
And then you can
generate frequency charts

00:24:08.260 --> 00:24:10.060
based on your classification.

00:24:10.060 --> 00:24:13.230
You're kind of reassembling
the data in a meaningful way.

00:24:13.230 --> 00:24:15.420
So you know what happened most.

00:24:15.420 --> 00:24:18.330
So maybe if long lines
is the main problem,

00:24:18.330 --> 00:24:21.010
maybe you need to do
something about it.

00:24:21.010 --> 00:24:24.480
And you'll see that you will
very quickly identify things

00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:25.930
and what you need to do.

00:24:25.930 --> 00:24:27.480
Another way of
doing that is what's

00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:29.180
called eyeballing the data.

00:24:29.180 --> 00:24:31.480
Just reading the
responses gives you

00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:33.360
a lot of information
and understanding

00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:36.200
about what happened there.

00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:38.080
This is an example.

00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:40.430
These are our responses
to this question, what

00:24:40.430 --> 00:24:42.900
was the reason you recently
used a piece of paper

00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:44.260
to write something down?

00:24:44.260 --> 00:24:47.500
And this is how you very quickly
eyeball the data into groups.

00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:51.080
Some people are making lists,
some people are writing ideas,

00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:52.900
some people are sketching stuff.

00:24:55.209 --> 00:24:56.750
If you want to read
more about this--

00:24:56.750 --> 00:24:59.250
you know almost nothing
about Experience Sampling

00:24:59.250 --> 00:24:59.870
at this point.

00:24:59.870 --> 00:25:06.260
If you want to read more about
it, this is a book I recommend.

00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:08.165
The last guy there
is a TED speaker.

00:25:08.165 --> 00:25:10.940
He speaks about
other things at TED.

00:25:10.940 --> 00:25:14.680
He speaks about flow, but
this is a really good book

00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:16.930
to understand
Experience Sampling.

00:25:16.930 --> 00:25:19.960
One second.

00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:23.770
So Experience Sampling is
what's called reality mining.

00:25:23.770 --> 00:25:25.415
You mine the reality
of your users.

00:25:28.029 --> 00:25:30.070
It helps you fall in love
with the problem, which

00:25:30.070 --> 00:25:36.380
is critical to solving a real
problem that people care about.

00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:40.970
And I know this is the
distribute sandbox,

00:25:40.970 --> 00:25:44.310
so let's make at least
one connection here.

00:25:44.310 --> 00:25:47.460
If you solve a real
problem people care about,

00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:51.430
I think it's very helpful
in terms of distribution.

00:25:51.430 --> 00:25:58.750
So last thought--
don't just believe

00:25:58.750 --> 00:26:00.970
everything I say
because I stand here.

00:26:00.970 --> 00:26:03.030
Try it out on your own.

00:26:03.030 --> 00:26:06.870
It's almost as
easy as it sounds.

00:26:06.870 --> 00:26:08.690
Thank you.
