00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:15.480
Why did you choose to do Othello?

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.150
For me, uh, you know

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:26.409
All the plays speak to whatever moment we happen to be living in it's it's part of the greatness of the writer

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.080
but I do think Othello is particularly resonant with this moment of

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.320
21st century United States, I feel like

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.440
the way in which otherness is

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.380
detailed in terms of racial otherness

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:43.690
religious otherness

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:46.310
Gender

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:47.810
everything

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:51.609
About the play feels like it speaks to this moment to me.

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.077
It's just felt urgent. It felt like an urgent story to tell.

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:56.380
I have to say that I

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.160
teach a freshman course in which I in the past. I've always taught

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:02.890
Hamlet as the

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:08.640
go to Shakespeare play at the beginning and I dropped it and substituted Othello.

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.360
When did when did you that? This year?

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:12.320
This year.

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.420
It just seemed to me just overwhelmingly clear that that is the play that

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:19.869
not only because of race and otherness also because of misogyny.

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:27.069
And the kind of violence murderousness that seeds just below the surface

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.070
on the subject just

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.020
It is important to use this play now.

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.869
And xenophobia too. Excuse me, but the fact that Othello is not

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:44.019
from the country that he's serving and the way in which that kind of immigrant bashing.

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:49.869
An Aryan barbarian Iago calls him. Yes, right Aryan barbarian, right?

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.540
The other thing I wanted to mention briefly

00:01:53.140 --> 00:02:00.240
in relation to race is that our production is we do it with only twelve actors because we really wanted to focus on

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:07.180
the intimacy of the domestic tragedy and of those twelve actors

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.300
Four self-identify as white and eight self-identify as people of color

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:17.400
So in addition to an African-American actor who plays Othello, we have Latinx actors, Native American actors

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:25.780
Asian-american and middle-eastern actor and that felt important to me in terms of interpreting the story in a

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:35.960
Contemporary context. You can't just say it's a tragedy and therefore there's no humor because actually Shakespeare's sense of dramatic

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.949
irony and the characters own sense of irony about the situation that they find themselves in

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.149
does lead to humor, you know for the audience at times and you know

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:50.890
there's obviously laughter you can welcome as a director and laughter you want to run screaming from so it's not that the goal is to

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:57.670
Make a laugh riot of a production, but I but I do think a tragedy that has

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:07.450
No laughter ever is probably not a good interpretation of that play for me. It certainly would be alien to Shakespeare who

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:10.970
Against all of the

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:12.560
the

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.560
classical norms actually

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.920
Always managed to integrate the two of them.

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:25.449
Othello is a particularly disturbing case of it because in effect a fellow is about an enormous practical joke

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.730
mmm of the most ghastly

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:34.569
Kind imaginable. But when Amelia at the end of the play finally shouts out what the audience's wanted to shout out

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:36.739
for the last two hours

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:42.969
Dolt idiot. Yeah that bursts out finally with that's the

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:45.349
climax of a

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:47.349
hideous practical joke.

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:52.238
So the question is what to do? When in fact when you watch Iago say

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:55.869
Let me figure out how to do this now. Cassio's a

00:03:56.419 --> 00:04:02.259
likely person for this role and so for and so on he's just making a kind of comic plot in the way that that

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:09.789
Shakespeare wrote elsewhere in his comedies to picture people putting together little practical jokes to trick Malvolio to do this or that and

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:17.169
and yet this turns out to be the most unbearable most painful as you said most intimate to

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:20.120
Soul-destroying

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.349
Vision and yet, it's it's built around this

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.559
Comic device, right? It's a

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:32.079
I'm I read the play of a thousand times. I've seen it a thousand times. I'm still astonished

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:38.319
Shakespeare carried this off. I mean that he succeeded in doing this is just I can't

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:43.959
Fathom how he succeeded in in tying these two things together

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:49.480
Shakespeare is the most musical of playwrights, um and that music pervades even without

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:53.799
The contributions of Verdi or Rossini or dozens of others?

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:56.710
Shakespeare actually is

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.200
Music is pervasive in

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:02.060
Shakespeare and

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:08.740
as if he were longing to write musicals and anyway a lot of the time I mean that and in the in the case

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:12.380
The interesting case of Othello is not so much that

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:17.760
Music is constantly present as it is. Let's say in Twelfth Night and in other plays

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:22.960
It's that the play is full of music verbally, it's as if the play were already

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.959
an extraordinary

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:28.929
lyric to be sung and the

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:31.610
that makes the

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:33.610
decision of Verdi or of

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:36.110
to write

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:38.110
arguably the greatest of his

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:40.869
literary adaptations and

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:46.630
Or of Rossini and others to take this play the natural because it's already singing

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:49.390
the there's a

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:53.260
famous critical phrase that Othello music and the

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:58.419
Othello's speech itself is charged as it were musically. It's actually

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:04.299
intense and in the way, he speaks since intense in the very word Othello that

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:07.959
That's something that pushes language out toward

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:11.799
the musical and in the case of of

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:14.210
Verdi I

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:15.740
mean certain way Verdi

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:21.519
drops lots of things from the play that I care about and that I'd be interested in he's not interested in anything to do with

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:22.790
with

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:25.569
politics as it were of the play, but the

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:29.180
Intense

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:36.640
Interest in the way in which at a certain extreme moment of human passion the voice begins to move toward

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:39.650
Singing

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:43.120
rather than speech seems to me both deep perception about

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:48.309
Something that Shakespeare already understood in in writing the play, you know

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:53.709
I want to I want to both approach the play as a brand-new play as if it was written

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:59.530
Today and the pages were just delivered into our rehearsal room and at the same time

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:05.830
I'm very aware that we are in dialogue with 400 years of production traditions, and there's certain choices that are

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:07.850
maybe

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:14.559
Caked over with kind of like an old painting there's kind of a brown glaze that can cake over the work

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:20.679
So how do we scrape that away and find the vibrant colors that were in the original?

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:23.589
Work of art that Shakespeare created, you know

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:27.730
So I feel that I do need to be in dialogue with

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:34.390
Learn as much as I can about production history and also be willing to completely throw all that out the window
