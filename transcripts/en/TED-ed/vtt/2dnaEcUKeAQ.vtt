00:00:06.142 --> 00:00:07.301
Hi, everybody!

00:00:07.325 --> 00:00:09.100
I am a comparative anatomist.

00:00:09.124 --> 00:00:12.584
A comparative anatomist is someone
who studies the structure of the body

00:00:12.608 --> 00:00:13.997
of lots of different animals.

00:00:14.021 --> 00:00:15.910
And my favorite animals are whales.

00:00:15.934 --> 00:00:18.469
I like to study whales
because they're so interesting.

00:00:18.493 --> 00:00:21.461
They've adapted to a unique environment
of living in the water.

00:00:21.485 --> 00:00:24.779
And what I'm going to tell you
about is how whales make sounds

00:00:24.803 --> 00:00:27.848
by basically farting with their face.

00:00:27.872 --> 00:00:30.743
You know that they do this farting thing
with their blowhole;

00:00:30.767 --> 00:00:32.102
they blow out air like that,

00:00:32.126 --> 00:00:34.194
but they also use air
in lots of other ways.

00:00:34.218 --> 00:00:37.138
They use it for sound production,
which is what I'll focus on,

00:00:37.162 --> 00:00:39.370
but I also study other things
they do with air,

00:00:39.394 --> 00:00:42.396
like keep it out of their bloodstream
so they don't get bubbles,

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.423
which is what happens
to human scuba divers

00:00:44.447 --> 00:00:46.212
when they get decompression sickness.

00:00:46.236 --> 00:00:47.974
But I'd like to start with the story

00:00:47.998 --> 00:00:50.197
of how these animals make
these farting noises,

00:00:50.221 --> 00:00:53.721
and that story begins with understanding
how hard it is to look at whales,

00:00:53.745 --> 00:00:56.364
because they live underwater
and they're really big,

00:00:56.388 --> 00:00:58.206
so they're hard animals to study.

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.917
And in this picture --
you see that animal in the middle?

00:01:00.941 --> 00:01:03.827
That's a baby whale
and it's already the size of a bus!

00:01:03.851 --> 00:01:06.549
When you look at whales,
start with the top of their head

00:01:06.573 --> 00:01:08.859
because their nose
is on the top of their head,

00:01:08.883 --> 00:01:10.419
kind of like a built-in snorkel.

00:01:10.443 --> 00:01:12.744
They breathe through that
because they're mammals

00:01:12.768 --> 00:01:14.028
and mammals breathe air.

00:01:14.052 --> 00:01:15.869
Their nose can be opened and closed,

00:01:15.893 --> 00:01:17.672
as if you were to pinch it like this.

00:01:17.696 --> 00:01:20.902
You can see it's open in the bottom frame,
where the red arrows are.

00:01:20.926 --> 00:01:22.982
But not all whales have two nostrils.

00:01:23.006 --> 00:01:25.823
Whales include the groups
of dolphins and porpoises,

00:01:25.847 --> 00:01:27.975
and dolphins and porpoises,
the small whales,

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:30.333
have only one nostril
on the top of their head,

00:01:30.357 --> 00:01:32.332
and they open and close that nostril

00:01:32.356 --> 00:01:35.609
by taking what is essentially
an upper lip, like this,

00:01:35.633 --> 00:01:38.872
and turning it back
over their nose, like this.

00:01:38.896 --> 00:01:41.054
That's how they open and close their nose.

00:01:41.078 --> 00:01:42.284
So when they make sounds,

00:01:42.308 --> 00:01:44.443
what they're basically
doing is a raspberry,

00:01:44.467 --> 00:01:47.690
(Makes raspberry sound)
which is kind of like a fart, right?

00:01:47.714 --> 00:01:49.874
Or up in New York,
we call it a Bronx cheer.

00:01:49.898 --> 00:01:51.223
And the way they do that

00:01:51.247 --> 00:01:54.175
is by taking that big,
fatty structure of a big fat lip,

00:01:54.199 --> 00:01:56.201
which, as you can see
here in this picture,

00:01:56.225 --> 00:01:58.749
which is a cut through the middle
of a dolphin's head,

00:01:58.773 --> 00:02:01.161
that big fat lip is that big
yellow portion there,

00:02:01.185 --> 00:02:04.448
and they roll it back and forth
over the top of their nose

00:02:04.472 --> 00:02:05.757
so that they vibrate it,

00:02:05.781 --> 00:02:08.126
kind of like when you let
the air out of a balloon

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:10.087
and it makes that weird vibration sound.

00:02:10.111 --> 00:02:12.855
So this is what it sounds like
when they make their noise:

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:13.899
(Vibration noise)

00:02:13.923 --> 00:02:16.371
Hear it? He'll do it again
when he faces the camera.

00:02:16.395 --> 00:02:17.410
(Vibration noise)

00:02:17.434 --> 00:02:19.158
Sounds like it's farting underwater.

00:02:19.182 --> 00:02:22.276
What that dolphin is actually doing,
though, is echolocation,

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.389
which is making these series of pulses,

00:02:24.413 --> 00:02:26.702
and it uses it like a bat uses sonar.

00:02:26.726 --> 00:02:29.558
Well, a bat uses radar,
but when it's underwater it's sonar,

00:02:29.582 --> 00:02:33.247
so this animal is using sonar
to see its world in sound.

00:02:33.271 --> 00:02:36.086
Trying to understand how this works,
you have to look at it

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.284
as if you were looking at the amplifier
speakers of a sound system.

00:02:39.308 --> 00:02:41.863
The small-toothed whales
are basically the "tweeters,"

00:02:41.887 --> 00:02:43.999
and the sound is coming
from that little nose

00:02:44.023 --> 00:02:46.950
that's moving back and forth
and coming out of their forehead.

00:02:46.974 --> 00:02:49.594
But the big whales
are kind of like the "woofers,"

00:02:49.618 --> 00:02:52.181
the big speakers that you have
in an amplifier system.

00:02:52.205 --> 00:02:55.236
And what's happening is their sound
is coming out of the throat.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.380
So if you tried to make
sound like a whale --

00:02:57.404 --> 00:03:00.785
make a sound right now, and go, "ahhhhhh."

00:03:00.809 --> 00:03:03.897
OK, now put your hand on your throat,
on your Adam's apple.

00:03:03.921 --> 00:03:06.043
You feel that vibration right there?

00:03:06.067 --> 00:03:07.978
That is lost energy for you,

00:03:08.002 --> 00:03:10.439
because that's not
how you communicate to everybody.

00:03:10.463 --> 00:03:11.916
You do it out of the mouth.

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.757
But if you open your mouth underwater,
no one will hear you.

00:03:14.781 --> 00:03:18.249
You have to be able to take this energy
and amplify it through the water.

00:03:18.273 --> 00:03:19.460
That's what whales do.

00:03:19.484 --> 00:03:21.055
And when you hear their sound --

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:22.392
(Squeaking sound)

00:03:22.416 --> 00:03:25.202
it's kind of like when you squeak
the air out of a balloon.

00:03:25.226 --> 00:03:27.106
So they get a lot of squeaky noises,

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:28.606
but they also have this sound:

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:30.543
(Vibrating sound)

00:03:30.567 --> 00:03:32.621
It sounds like it's farting, doesn't it?

00:03:32.645 --> 00:03:36.013
It's like it's got this giant
whoopee cushion in its throat.

00:03:36.037 --> 00:03:38.375
So, how do you know
that's what a whale is doing?

00:03:38.399 --> 00:03:40.947
Well, we study whales that come
to us from strandings.

00:03:40.971 --> 00:03:42.895
These are animals that die on the beach.

00:03:42.919 --> 00:03:45.332
Small whales like dolphins
and porpoises are easy;

00:03:45.356 --> 00:03:46.712
we can take them to the lab.

00:03:46.736 --> 00:03:49.649
But the big whales -- we've got
to bring the lab to the whale.

00:03:49.673 --> 00:03:51.355
And this is what that looks like.

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:54.114
I'm the one in the middle
with the red hat.

00:03:54.138 --> 00:03:55.566
I'm not a very tall person,

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.083
so you can see how big
this whale was compared to me.

00:03:58.107 --> 00:03:59.362
The whale is 65 feet long.

00:03:59.386 --> 00:04:02.123
And my scalpel is this little tool
on the side here.

00:04:02.147 --> 00:04:05.521
It basically looks like a hockey stick
with a blade on the end of it.

00:04:05.545 --> 00:04:08.510
And doing a dissection of a whale
is a very difficult process.

00:04:08.534 --> 00:04:10.493
You literally have to get into your work.

00:04:10.517 --> 00:04:13.238
It's kind of like a giant
bloody construction zone.

00:04:13.262 --> 00:04:14.558
You're wearing a hard hat,

00:04:14.582 --> 00:04:16.539
you're working with heavy machinery.

00:04:16.563 --> 00:04:17.896
In this case, by the way,

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:20.738
that's just the voice box of a blue whale.

00:04:20.762 --> 00:04:21.913
Just the voice box.

00:04:21.937 --> 00:04:24.865
I'm only five feet tall --
you can see it's like 12 feet long.

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:26.373
How do we know what's going on?

00:04:26.397 --> 00:04:28.461
Well, we look at the voice box, or larynx,

00:04:28.485 --> 00:04:31.426
and we see -- this is from a baby
whale so it's much smaller.

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:34.124
You see this little u-shaped thing
I've outlined in blue.

00:04:34.148 --> 00:04:35.729
That's the part that's vibrating.

00:04:35.753 --> 00:04:37.376
It's kind of like our vocal folds.

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.004
When I put my hand in there,
where that blue sleeve is,

00:04:40.028 --> 00:04:41.987
you can see there's a sack underneath it.

00:04:42.011 --> 00:04:43.313
That's the whoopee cushion.

00:04:43.337 --> 00:04:45.344
That's the air bubble or the balloon.

00:04:45.368 --> 00:04:47.008
So what these animals are doing --

00:04:47.032 --> 00:04:50.001
and you can see, there's this big
black balloon in the throat,

00:04:50.025 --> 00:04:52.096
where the digestive tract,
which is in blue,

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:54.927
meets the breathing tract,
which is in light blue,

00:04:54.951 --> 00:04:56.957
and right in the middle
is that black sack.

00:04:56.981 --> 00:04:59.569
These animals are using
that sack to make these sounds.

00:04:59.593 --> 00:05:01.788
And so they vibrate that and send it out.

00:05:01.812 --> 00:05:05.181
Small-toothed whales also have air sacks;
they're all over their heads,

00:05:05.205 --> 00:05:06.644
so it's like they're airheads.

00:05:06.668 --> 00:05:08.929
They use this to capture
as much air as they can

00:05:08.953 --> 00:05:10.961
to take down with them
when they're diving,

00:05:10.985 --> 00:05:13.021
because when you dive, pressures increase,

00:05:13.045 --> 00:05:15.761
and that decreases the volume
of air you have available.

00:05:15.785 --> 00:05:16.937
But more importantly,

00:05:16.961 --> 00:05:20.257
having that sack allows them
to recycle the air that they're using,

00:05:20.281 --> 00:05:22.008
because air is a precious commodity.

00:05:22.032 --> 00:05:25.050
You don't want to have to go
back up to the surface to get more.

00:05:25.074 --> 00:05:27.768
So when you make a sound underwater,
if you're a whale --

00:05:27.792 --> 00:05:30.332
let's hear you start making
a sound, go "ahhhh."

00:05:30.356 --> 00:05:32.816
But whales keep their mouths
closed, so go "ahhhmm."

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:33.895
(Audience makes noise)

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:35.189
You're all humming, right?

00:05:35.213 --> 00:05:37.514
But whales keep their nose
closed and go, "mmmm."

00:05:37.538 --> 00:05:38.688
(Makes noise)

00:05:38.863 --> 00:05:40.387
What happened?

00:05:40.411 --> 00:05:43.084
You can't make the sound anymore
once you close your nose

00:05:43.108 --> 00:05:44.933
because you've pressurized the system.

00:05:44.957 --> 00:05:48.567
Whales, by having air sacks, keep
themselves from pressurizing the system,

00:05:48.591 --> 00:05:50.669
which means the air continues to flow,

00:05:50.693 --> 00:05:52.971
and so if you had a bag
on the end of your nose,

00:05:52.995 --> 00:05:55.003
you'd be able to make
air continue to flow.

00:05:55.027 --> 00:05:56.603
So I hope you've enjoyed that.

00:05:56.627 --> 00:05:59.174
That's what a comparative anatomist
does for a living.

00:05:59.198 --> 00:06:01.113
We study the structure of these animals.

00:06:01.137 --> 00:06:03.962
We try to mimic it; we apply it
back to the human situation,

00:06:03.986 --> 00:06:06.977
maybe making new technologies
for protective devices

00:06:07.001 --> 00:06:09.311
or maybe even making
new treatments for medicines

00:06:09.335 --> 00:06:12.275
for people's diseases who mimic
these weird environments.

00:06:12.299 --> 00:06:14.145
So I hope you enjoyed that. Thank you.

00:06:14.169 --> 00:06:15.319
(Applause)
