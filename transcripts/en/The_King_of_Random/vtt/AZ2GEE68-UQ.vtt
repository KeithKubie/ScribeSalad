00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:10.580
When your sink or bathtub is clogged and backing
up with water, rather than reaching for harsh

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:14.809
chemical drain cleaners, try reaching for
your toilet plunger first. Place the plunger

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:18.930
over the open drain and work it back and forth
the same way you’d unclog a toilet. Within

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.340
a few seconds, the clog will disappear, allowing
your sink to drain normally, saving you time

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.320
and money.

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.820
An open cut, or blemish, is an invitation
for infection, and if you don’t have antibiotic

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.440
ointments handy, you might be surprised by
what you can use instead. Honey has antiseptic

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.690
properties that fight all kinds of bacteria.
So just drop a dab of honey over your wound,

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.190
then cover it with something like a band-aid.
The honey fights off infections, and helps

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.379
speed the healing process as well.

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:51.220
If your trampoline is an eye sore, and the
uncovered springs are an accident just waiting

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:56.110
to happen, why not fix both problems at once
with some cheap pool noodles. Simply cut sections

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.080
a little longer than the springs, then push
the them through the holes in the centers

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:03.220
so they make a nice snug fit. Now hook the
ends of the springs back onto the tramp, and

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:06.670
repeat the process with the others. If you
alternate the colors, you’ll end up with

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.680
a custom pattern that will give a new life
to your old tramp. Kids will think it’s

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.970
way more fun, and now your springs are padded,
and protected from the elements as well.

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.370
When you’re taking out the trash, a full
garbage bag isn’t a big deal if your trash

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:23.880
bags have built in handle ties. But what if
you’re trying to save money and using the

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.720
cheaper variety? When they’re full, there’s
hardly anything to work with, and tying them

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.909
off seems nearly impossible. But it doesn’t
have to be. Just gather opposite sides at

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:36.380
the top to form little handles, then spin
the bag around 4 to 5 times. This will twist

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.750
the handles to the point where they can be
tied together easily. And now you can enjoy

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.780
the convenience of handle tie trash bags,
without having to pay for the more expensive

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.820
brands.

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.610
Before you go on vacation, try putting some
leftover juice in the freezer until it freezes

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.810
completely solid. This way, it will stay in
place even with the bottle upside down. Now

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.820
cut the top off another bottle and push the
two together so they lock in place. Put the

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.580
container back in the freezer with the frozen
juice at the top, and now you’ve got a modest

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.380
little device that will help save you from
food poisoning. When you get back from your

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.970
trip, simply open the freezer and check to
see if the juice is still at the top. If it

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.190
is, then your power stayed on the entire time,
and your food is still safe to eat. But if

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.760
the juice is at the bottom, that means the
freezer lost power, and everything thawed

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.420
out long enough to start growing harmful food
poisoning bacteria.

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:25.069
Well now you know 5 more tricks that will
help save you money, and make your life a

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:26.160
little easier.
