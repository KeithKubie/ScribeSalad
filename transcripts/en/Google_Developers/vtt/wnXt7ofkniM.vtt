DON DODGE: Hello everyone.

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.780
Welcome to the session.

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:09.140
I do this session every year,
and it's always packed.

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:12.470
So it's great to see
you all here.

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:17.820
This is about how to take an
idea from a weekend hack to a

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.480
funded start-up.

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.670
And I have a great panel here
of people who have done it

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:27.440
themselves, who have invested
in companies like that, and

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:30.690
who are today professional
venture capitalists.

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:33.310
So let's start by introducing
the panel.

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:37.080
Rich Miner, tell us
about yourself.

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.390
RICH MINER: Sure, so a

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:39.810
background in computer science.

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:43.000
Have done a couple of
start-ups, been

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.670
around for a while.

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:45.720
My first one was in
the early '90s.

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.150
Actually even before then I
helped a guy starting a

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:50.060
company called Avid Technology,
which is a video

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.060
editing system that most of
the videos you see were

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:54.010
created on.

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.190
I did that while I was
at university.

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.080
Then I started another company
called Wild Fire

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.560
Communications, which I sold
to Orange, European mobile

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:01.760
phone company.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.540
And then started a venture fund
for them, invested in

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:05.760
some companies.

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.040
One of them was run by this
guy called Andy Rubin, a

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.530
company called Danger.

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.070
Kept in touch with Andy and then
co-founded a company with

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.260
him called Android, which I sold
to Google, and then have

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.710
helped Google get Google
Ventures going.

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:22.790
Now I invest in start-ups.

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.730
DON DODGE: Kevin Rose probably
needs no introduction, but

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:27.020
tell us a little bit.

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.970
KEVIN ROSE: Sure, been
doing the start-up

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:31.200
thing for since 2004.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:37.800
Started Digg, a social news
site, also Revision 3, Pownce,

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.020
Milk, Oink.

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.850
We follow a ton of little
fun crazy projects.

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.470
And started angel investing
probably about three years ago

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.950
and have since joined Google
and moved on as a venture

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.420
partner in Google Ventures.

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.577
NAVAL RAVIKANT: I'm Naval I'm
the founder and CEO of Angel

00:01:53.577 --> 00:01:56.185
List, and prior to that I was an
entrepreneur and co-author

00:01:56.185 --> 00:01:59.450
of Venture Hacks and started
companies and everything,

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.820
being from optical amplifiers
and dot-coms and made

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.600
investors money, lost investors
money, made money,

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.270
lost money, lose money.

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:12.520
Now helping other people
make and lose money.

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.540
DON DODGE: Excellent, OK, so
you're all entrepreneurs,

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.480
started multiple companies.

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.330
You're angel investors and have

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.660
invested in many companies.

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.990
Two of you are now
professional VCs.

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:28.410
What do you look for when
you make an investment?

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.060
What are those things?

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.970
Is it the team?

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:31.820
Is it the product?

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:33.160
Is it the idea?

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.620
Tell us what you look for when
you make a decision.

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.080
KEVIN ROSE: So personally I like
ideas that are just big,

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.660
groundbreaking new ideas.

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.370
Every time there's a pop in the
industry, something like a

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.530
Pinterest or a Groupon or you
name it, you see 50, 100 other

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.060
ideas along that
genre of idea.

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.340
And 99% of the time those
will never succeed.

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.340
Those are just people that
are copying other ideas.

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.260
The one time that I actually
did see that work was when

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.130
Yammer took Twitter and made it
into a business platform.

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:11.230
But oftentimes those
just fizzle out.

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:15.710
So something that's
just potentially--

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:18.060
something that just hasn't
been done before.

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:19.560
I'm tired of seeing the
same thing over and

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:20.930
over and over again.

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:24.690
DON DODGE: But I would remind
you, Google was probably the

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.220
12th search engine, maybe 15th
search engine that came along.

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.590
KEVIN ROSE: Sure, but the page
rank was a completely new way

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:33.650
of looking at how to rank
documents, though, right?

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:35.320
NAVAL RAVIKANT: Also, I
think Google never--

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:37.500
I had the misfortune of knowing
Larry and Sergey from

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.090
the early days and
not showing up.

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.620
And at least my sense at the
time was it was in no way

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:43.790
derivative.

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.540
They did not say we are
the AltaVista of x.

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.200
They never described
themselves as such.

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.560
So I just thought they thought
of it as something

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.310
fundamentally different.

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:54.030
I would echo what Kevin said.

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.660
You definitely want big ideas.

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:58.760
But frankly ideas are
a dime a dozen.

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.730
And a lot of the recently
celebrated success cases and

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:04.730
exits like Instagram
and Yammer and

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:07.150
Omgpop were all pivots.

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:10.250
And the thing that I'm learning
myself doing Angel

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:13.000
List, which is an enormous
struggle, all start-ups are,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.450
but this is like the biggest
struggle ever for me--

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:18.140
the thing I've realized is that
determination matters

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:19.680
more than almost
anything else.

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.430
If you stick with something to
the bitter end, and if you're

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:25.130
smart, and you're working in a
big space, and you just do not

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:29.260
give up, I think you'll have a
better outcome than people who

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.180
are looking for that pop.

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:34.520
So in a sense, I reject the
premise of the title of this

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.040
panel, which is I don't think
you should take your weekend

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:42.010
hack into a start-up, because
a real start-up is a 5 or 10

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:43.550
year commitment of your life.

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:45.640
It's like getting married
but worse.

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:48.460
Without a lot of the
intermediate upside.

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:49.730
There's a lot less
sex involved.

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:51.760
RICH MINER: It would depend on
the marriage, by the way.

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:53.520
NAVAL RAVIKANT: Yes,
that's right.

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.330
It does depend on
the marriage.

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:58.380
And in many cases harder to get
divorced from a start-up

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:02.110
because you're divorcing
your entire network.

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:04.830
So I would not go from a weekend
hack to a start-up

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:06.950
unless that weekend hack is
something you were deeply,

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:09.310
deeply, deeply passionate
about.

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:11.450
And you are now in
Silicon Valley.

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:13.520
You are competing against the
best people in the world who

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.920
have been attracted from all
around the world, doing what

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:16.520
they do best.

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.140
Ninety-ninth percentile
is not good enough.

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:20.270
If you're a 99th percentile,
you will go home

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:21.750
in tears and ruin.

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:24.260
So you need to be a
99.99 percentile.

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.290
And the way you get there is
by being obsessed with

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:28.630
something, so that
is all you do.

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:31.230
And you shouldn't bother
building a start-up with

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:32.620
anything you're not
obsessed about.

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:35.520
So it is this perfect storm of,
you have to have the right

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:37.230
knowledge, you have to be
teamed up with the right

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:38.450
people, you have to be
working on something

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:39.720
you really care about.

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:41.870
Coincidentally it also has to
be big, because a lot of us

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:43.340
are passionate about things
that are not world

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:45.530
changing in the end.

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:46.890
It has to be relatively
unique.

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:47.940
The timing has to be good.

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:49.110
Your execution has
to be flawless.

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:50.910
You have to be teamed up
with the right people.

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:52.760
And even then you're probably
better off being a venture

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:55.010
capitalist as far as the
economics are concerned.

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:57.540
So you really got
to be into it.

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:59.200
RICH MINER: I want to emphasize
one thing, which is

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:02.180
the people that was mentioned,
because typically for me

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:04.200
that's almost even first
and foremost

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:05.650
above the idea itself.

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:09.250
And people is best if it's
team, not individual.

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:12.430
And even the data shows this,
that founding teams are better

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:14.340
than individual founders.

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:16.010
That doesn't mean as a sole
founder you shouldn't be

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:17.910
pushing forward your idea, but
you should definitely get

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:20.690
teamed up with great people,
because for me it's often a

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:26.010
gut feel as to, this might be
a good idea, but frankly, I

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:27.510
don't think this team
can execute on it.

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:28.930
I'll likely not invest,
no matter how

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:30.790
much I like the idea.

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:34.160
At the same time, if I think
that somebody has something

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:37.060
but it doesn't seem quite
right, but I'm really

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:39.800
impressed with the team, where
it's a crowded space where

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.540
other people have gone into
it, but they have a slide

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:43.800
twist on it, and I'm really
impressed with the team--

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:46.230
and I think that was probably
the case with Google, with

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:47.000
Larry and Sergey.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.400
I think people saw, yes this is
search and search-like, but

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:53.470
there's some really bright
people here with a different

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:54.720
way of looking at it.

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:57.850
And so founding teams I think
for a lot of investors is

00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:00.470
definitely something that's
up there in importance.

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:02.430
And in fact, a lot of people say
it's the people, people,

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:05.840
people is the top three
things they look at.

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:06.350
DON DODGE: They do.

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:12.760
They say team, idea, market,
which of those--

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:14.830
do all of them have
to be present?

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:19.340
Do you have to have a
demonstrable product?

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:22.240
What stage do you get involved
and what are the most

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:24.115
important factors in
your decision?

00:07:24.115 --> 00:07:25.695
RICH MINER: The litmus test I
do is, do I like the team?

00:07:25.695 --> 00:07:28.360
Does this seem like an idea
that I can understand?

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:30.400
Do I think that team understands
who they're going

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:33.170
to target market that idea to,
what the population of that

00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:35.480
group is, and how they're going
to start targeting some

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:36.780
initial segment of it?

00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:40.000
And then ideally, if they do
that, do you believe there's

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.230
some way that you
can make money.

00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:44.490
And if you look at the dollars
times the market times who of

00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:46.490
that market they think they can
address, does that look

00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:48.150
like an interesting business?

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:50.210
And those are sort of the
quick back of the

00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:50.830
envelope I'll do.

00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:52.290
And you don't need to have all
of those things if you're

00:07:52.290 --> 00:07:54.480
blown away by a couple of them
and they're missing something,

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:56.460
but you think they'll
figure it out.

00:07:56.460 --> 00:07:59.490
And oftentimes it's how do they
make money, especially in

00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:00.380
consumer internet.

00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:02.500
But if you really think they
can blow something up big,

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:04.280
typically money follows.

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:06.130
That's not necessarily a good
answer for you to have.

00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:09.860
You want to have thought it
through a little bit.

00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:12.690
But you don't have to have,
here's our 30 year revenue.

00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:16.150
That's not going to be
believable anyways.

00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:17.055
DON DODGE: Kevin,
any thoughts.

00:08:17.055 --> 00:08:20.820
KEVIN ROSE: Yeah, I think that
in consumer Internet plays

00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:23.130
oftentimes they don't really
have a business model.

00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:26.090
I remember when I first saw
Instagram and sat down with

00:08:26.090 --> 00:08:28.760
Kevin, I wanted to invest.

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:34.070
He really wasn't even thinking
about revenue at that point.

00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:35.559
But it was clear that
he had so much.

00:08:35.559 --> 00:08:38.039
He had a little seed of
traction, and I could just

00:08:38.039 --> 00:08:41.020
tell that how quickly he was
spreading over the course of I

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:42.580
think he had been launched
for probably about

00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:43.710
two or three weeks.

00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:45.980
He already had great numbers.

00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:47.590
And there was no one
else in that space.

00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:49.510
So he was kind of the
first to the space.

00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:51.170
It was super simple,
lightweight,

00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:53.070
elegant, easy to use.

00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:55.160
He put a lot of emphasis
on performance.

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:58.510
Doing a lot of the uploading
of the images in the

00:08:58.510 --> 00:09:00.520
background, so from a user
experience it was

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:02.620
really clean and fast.

00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:07.660
In that case I wanted to go in
based solely on the fact that

00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:10.330
he was just really executing
and building something that

00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:12.680
was first to market.

00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:15.470
But, yeah I agree in that
team is most important.

00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:18.500
There was an investment I did
in a company called Yobongo,

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:23.500
which this guy, the CEO Caleb,
smart early 20-somethings

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:26.890
entrepreneur that blew me away
when we sat down and we had

00:09:26.890 --> 00:09:27.450
some coffee.

00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:28.530
And he was just this

00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:31.350
phenomenal, really big thinker.

00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:34.380
He ended up selling his company,
and I made most of

00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:35.710
the money back.

00:09:35.710 --> 00:09:37.800
And now he's working
on another project.

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:40.950
But if he goes into something
else, I will back him again,

00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:44.640
because you sit down with the
person and you know, this

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:47.340
might not be the idea, but
they're going to hit some day.

00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:49.862
And they're going to hit big,
because just of who they are.

00:09:49.862 --> 00:09:53.440
DON DODGE: Excellent, there are
microphones on either side

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:56.820
here, and I want to encourage
your questions.

00:09:56.820 --> 00:09:59.360
So think up questions,
stand at the mic.

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:02.170
I'll recognize you and
have you do it.

00:10:02.170 --> 00:10:04.250
I'm going to continue to ask
questions, but if someone

00:10:04.250 --> 00:10:08.120
stands up, I'll let you in.

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:10.580
Naval, Angel List.

00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:15.020
Angel List has really changed
the early stage angel

00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:17.190
investing scene.

00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:17.980
Give us some numbers.

00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:20.210
How many projects are
on Angel List?

00:10:20.210 --> 00:10:22.240
How many have been funded?

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:23.390
How many investors?

00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:25.140
NAVAL RAVIKANT: So anyone
can list a project.

00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:26.350
That's not hard.

00:10:26.350 --> 00:10:27.330
You can just go create
a profile.

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:30.070
So we have 70,000 of those.

00:10:30.070 --> 00:10:32.840
Of them, I'd say probably
between 10 and 15,000 are

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:35.780
actually legitimate attempts
at companies.

00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:38.170
In other words, people are
thoughtful about if they're

00:10:38.170 --> 00:10:39.320
actually going to pursue it.

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:42.460
Of that, I'd say about 3
to 4,000 are probably

00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:43.570
finance-able.

00:10:43.570 --> 00:10:47.200
And of those maybe 1 in 2,000
have gotten financed.

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:49.350
Not all of that volume get
driven by Angel List.

00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:51.470
To some extent we're a listing
service, to some extent we're

00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:52.850
a matchmaking service.

00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:56.180
On the matchmaking side, we've
probably driven a little over

00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:58.200
1,000 of those investments.

00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:00.130
We do about 200 introductions
a week between

00:11:00.130 --> 00:11:01.670
start-ups and investors.

00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:05.260
And we drive right now about
600 introduction in a week

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:07.050
between talent and start-ups.

00:11:07.050 --> 00:11:09.960
So if your company fails, and
you want to go join a cool

00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:12.180
start-up very early on,
we try and make that

00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:14.080
easier for you as well.

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:16.200
And I don't think it's
changed the investing

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:18.220
landscape that much yet.

00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:20.940
We're still working on
a lot of things.

00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:22.710
It's only a little over
two years old.

00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:26.370
I think what's really happened
is the landscape itself has

00:11:26.370 --> 00:11:29.260
changed, and we're just more
a reflection of that.

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:31.500
And what's changed is the cost
of building a start-up at

00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:32.920
least early on has collapsed.

00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:34.500
You can launch and then raise.

00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:37.590
You can get really far
in 250 or 500K.

00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:38.980
So the set of investors
that are

00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:40.770
available to you has expanded.

00:11:40.770 --> 00:11:42.270
The number of people playing
has expanded.

00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:43.880
Investors can get
more data point.

00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:45.500
There's a lot more competition,
a lot more noise,

00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:47.100
a lot less signal.

00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:48.800
There's a lot of
stuff going on.

00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:51.720
So the market is changing very,
very rapidly, and it's

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:55.100
changing in fundamental
structural ways.

00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:58.030
And I think a lot that is
happening because we have

00:11:58.030 --> 00:12:01.570
these deployment and code
platforms like Amazon and

00:12:01.570 --> 00:12:03.860
Google and so on that you can
spread your product on.

00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:05.280
We have development platforms.

00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:08.870
We have labor platforms,
mechanical turf, and so on.

00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:11.070
And now we have capital
platforms, like Angel List and

00:12:11.070 --> 00:12:11.910
Kick Starter.

00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:13.990
So you combine all that together
and the leverage

00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:16.730
available to a modern
entrepreneur is unbelievable.

00:12:16.730 --> 00:12:20.440
I was talking to a fellow guy
that I sort of worked

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:21.890
with 10 years ago.

00:12:21.890 --> 00:12:24.050
We're coming up the escalator.

00:12:24.050 --> 00:12:25.760
I'm like, so what did you used
to do at this company?

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:27.070
We had two companies that
ended up merging.

00:12:27.070 --> 00:12:30.990
And he said, oh I used to build
data slicing stuff.

00:12:30.990 --> 00:12:35.020
So, oh OK, you had like a team
of 10 people doing manually

00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:37.270
what you could with a day
with Solar today, right.

00:12:37.270 --> 00:12:38.620
You could just set up
your Solar instance

00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:39.980
and you'd be done.

00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:42.030
So things have changed,
and it's great.

00:12:42.030 --> 00:12:45.280
But it just means it's also
extremely competitive.

00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:47.100
And Angel List is a reflection
of that.

00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:49.500
As the number of companies
has scaled, the number of

00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:50.330
investors has scaled.

00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:52.140
The amount of data
you need scales.

00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:53.920
The amount of capital
you need goes down.

00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:55.770
The information you need has
to be digestible in a

00:12:55.770 --> 00:12:56.730
different format.

00:12:56.730 --> 00:12:58.840
And so if an Angel List did
not exist it would be

00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:00.850
necessary to create it.

00:13:00.850 --> 00:13:05.550
DON DODGE: So Angel List has
raised significant money for

00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:07.220
over 1,000 companies.

00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:11.000
Most recently I read about
Rally, which I think Kevin is

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.240
an investor in and Google
Ventures is an investor in.

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:18.200
And they raised 8 million total
and 4 million of that

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:19.380
through Angel List.

00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:21.340
NAVAL RAVIKANT: Yeah, between
4 and 4 and a half.

00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:22.835
KEVIN ROSE: That's how I
initially found out about it

00:13:22.835 --> 00:13:23.954
was Angel List.

00:13:23.954 --> 00:13:25.270
NAVAL RAVIKANT: Great,
excellent, I hope

00:13:25.270 --> 00:13:26.090
they make you money.

00:13:26.090 --> 00:13:29.030
DON DODGE: Raising $4 million
on Angel List, that's pretty

00:13:29.030 --> 00:13:29.570
disruptive.

00:13:29.570 --> 00:13:31.340
That was never possible
before.

00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:33.340
NAVAL RAVIKANT: Yeah, well
there's a VC firm in there.

00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:36.210
And that's one of the dirty
secrets of Angel List is more

00:13:36.210 --> 00:13:38.390
than half the flow in capital
comes from venture

00:13:38.390 --> 00:13:39.500
capitalists.

00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:42.160
There are a lot of VCs playing
the seed market now.

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:45.590
The whole power of the series
A firms has traditionally

00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:48.040
derived from being
first money in.

00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:50.650
And to the extent that a venture
firm is not able to

00:13:50.650 --> 00:13:53.110
play in the first money in
space, they gradually lose

00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:55.280
influence and control of
the entrepreneurs.

00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:58.860
And what has happened is the
series A firms used to be the

00:13:58.860 --> 00:13:59.970
first money in.

00:13:59.970 --> 00:14:01.710
These are all the
names you know.

00:14:01.710 --> 00:14:04.110
And then in front of them sprung
up the super angels.

00:14:04.110 --> 00:14:05.700
Then in front of sprung
up the angels.

00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:07.490
And in front of them sprung
up the incubators.

00:14:07.490 --> 00:14:09.790
So the chain has gotten
a lot larger now.

00:14:09.790 --> 00:14:12.380
A lot the venture capital
firms are now doing seed

00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:14.650
investing, and they're trying to
get back to the first money

00:14:14.650 --> 00:14:15.980
in principle.

00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:19.840
And that is causing huge
pricing and behavior

00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:22.020
aberrations in the market,
because to a venture

00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:25.050
capitalist, $25 million
out of their fund

00:14:25.050 --> 00:14:26.210
is a marketing expense.

00:14:26.210 --> 00:14:28.400
They might be perfectly happy
just spending that to build

00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:29.790
relationships.

00:14:29.790 --> 00:14:33.620
Maybe the next Caleb to your
point, but to an angel or a

00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:35.370
seed fund that's your
life blood.

00:14:35.370 --> 00:14:37.530
You've got to make money
on that pile.

00:14:37.530 --> 00:14:39.604
So we're seeing some really
aberrant behavior in the

00:14:39.604 --> 00:14:40.611
market right now.

00:14:40.611 --> 00:14:42.100
DON DODGE: So did
you hear that?

00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:46.250
Kevin found out about
Rally on Angel List.

00:14:46.250 --> 00:14:50.530
So if you don't have any other
avenue to get to investors,

00:14:50.530 --> 00:14:54.140
get yourself on Angel List,
and people like us--

00:14:54.140 --> 00:14:56.480
I think every one of us is on
Angel List and there are

00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:58.270
thousands of investors there.

00:14:58.270 --> 00:14:59.410
So that's a good point.

00:14:59.410 --> 00:15:01.630
NAVAL RAVIKANT: Not to set
expectations crazy, the

00:15:01.630 --> 00:15:03.600
reality is we get about a
hundred company profiles

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:05.060
created a day.

00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:07.530
80 or 90 of them we could
never look at.

00:15:07.530 --> 00:15:09.990
We do algorithmic screens on
them, incomplete profile,

00:15:09.990 --> 00:15:12.400
social graph filter, structure
traction, where you went to

00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:13.980
school, all that stuff.

00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:16.770
Maybe the top 10 or 15 we
actually manually review.

00:15:16.770 --> 00:15:20.540
And maybe one every two days
we get to send out.

00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:23.600
And there's another one or two
that get funded either

00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:26.080
serendipitously or because their
own network on Angel

00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:27.600
List shares them.

00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:30.680
So it is still, we don't take
your un-financeable company

00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:33.650
and make it financeable But
hopefully we can accelerate

00:15:33.650 --> 00:15:35.270
financing, get you
more options.

00:15:35.270 --> 00:15:38.380
And essentially you can think of
us as running a global spam

00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:41.030
filter in the crowd for busy
venture capitalists.

00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:43.590
There's no reason why every
VC firm needs to have 10

00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:45.060
associates screening
deal flow.

00:15:45.060 --> 00:15:46.840
You can just put them all in the
cloud and screen out the

00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:47.820
obvious junk.

00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:49.190
And then beyond that level,
we're trying to

00:15:49.190 --> 00:15:51.270
find fit and judgment.

00:15:51.270 --> 00:15:53.680
That's where the human
element comes in.

00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:57.130
And to Rich's point, I think I
completely agree that team is

00:15:57.130 --> 00:15:58.780
the most important thing.

00:15:58.780 --> 00:16:01.440
And so the place where Angel
List and any online network

00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:03.840
falls down is on screening
the team.

00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:07.090
So we're working very hard on
introducing new features that

00:16:07.090 --> 00:16:09.640
help you figure out who the
good people are and how to

00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:12.210
screen them and analyze their
backgrounds and at least do

00:16:12.210 --> 00:16:15.320
another level of filtering
there, because another thing

00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:17.250
any good venture capitalists
will tell you is they usually

00:16:17.250 --> 00:16:20.170
know within the first five
minutes if the team is

00:16:20.170 --> 00:16:20.960
backable or not.

00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:23.010
And then they got to sit through
the next 40 or 50

00:16:23.010 --> 00:16:24.880
minutes scheduled on the
calendar, looking at their

00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:26.870
watch, trying not to look
at their BlackBerry.

00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:28.270
Not because they're rude,
because they're busy and

00:16:28.270 --> 00:16:29.850
they've already sort
of decided.

00:16:29.850 --> 00:16:32.440
So that should be a more
efficient filtering process.

00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:34.550
DON DODGE: I'd like to drill
down more on that in a minute.

00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:38.470
But first let's take some
questions from the audience.

00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:40.920
AUDIENCE: Thank you, I want to
hear about that as well.

00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:43.340
And you're also mentioning
some things that are not

00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:44.070
understandable to me.

00:16:44.070 --> 00:16:47.640
You're talking about
different levels of

00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:49.310
pre-investors and all that.

00:16:49.310 --> 00:16:51.500
And so I guess my question's
about how do you get an

00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:53.890
audience that starts any of
those kinds of things going?

00:16:53.890 --> 00:16:56.320
And I guess you mentioned Angel
List, which is helpful.

00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:58.190
If you could tell more about
that, and the other part I

00:16:58.190 --> 00:17:02.750
have a question of is, a lot of
what you're explaining are

00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:05.180
ideas for huge companies,
like the next Pinterest

00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:05.780
or whatever it is.

00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:09.589
But what about those kind of
medium size, I think I have a

00:17:09.589 --> 00:17:13.880
great idea, something that
requires a creative team and

00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:15.200
some full time as well.

00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:16.530
But we're not talking
about hundreds.

00:17:16.530 --> 00:17:19.910
We're talking about
a dozen or so.

00:17:19.910 --> 00:17:22.640
So anyways, is there any avenue
for someone to get a

00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:26.500
start-up like that and if you
have any advice on that?

00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:29.120
NAVAL RAVIKANT: I think it's
just a bad road to go down.

00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:30.960
If you go to someone, you say
I'm trying to buy something

00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:33.610
small and medium sized,
you're un-fundable.

00:17:33.610 --> 00:17:36.460
And you're un-fundable, because
in game theory terms,

00:17:36.460 --> 00:17:38.720
this is what's called a
Keynesian Beauty Contest,

00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:41.460
where each round of judges is
trying to pick what the next

00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:43.030
round of judges is
going to pick.

00:17:43.030 --> 00:17:44.950
So the problem an angel has
is if you're not going for

00:17:44.950 --> 00:17:47.750
something big is, they don't
want to invest in you because

00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:50.060
they know that no VC will invest
in you because VCs have

00:17:50.060 --> 00:17:52.130
big funds and only want to
go in for big things.

00:17:52.130 --> 00:17:53.800
And the VCs don't want to invest
in you, because the

00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:55.355
private equity people won't
eventually want

00:17:55.355 --> 00:17:56.340
to invest in you.

00:17:56.340 --> 00:17:58.120
And because that angel doesn't
want to invest in you,

00:17:58.120 --> 00:17:59.420
incubators aren't going to
want to invest in you.

00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:01.030
So that knowledge ripples
all the way

00:18:01.030 --> 00:18:02.150
back through the chain.

00:18:02.150 --> 00:18:05.240
So unless you can build
something or you have a shot,

00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:08.320
not everything goes huge
obviously, but if your

00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:11.970
aspiration is not to be huge,
you end up un-financeable

00:18:11.970 --> 00:18:14.920
That said, a lot of these things
that turn out to be

00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:17.870
huge are completely non-obvious
they're going to

00:18:17.870 --> 00:18:19.510
be huge in the beginning.

00:18:19.510 --> 00:18:22.750
So I don't think you have
to necessarily have an

00:18:22.750 --> 00:18:24.720
articulation for how it's
going to be gigantic.

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:26.975
Like I don't think either
Instagram or Pinterest could

00:18:26.975 --> 00:18:28.070
have made that argument
credible early on.

00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:29.470
AUDIENCE: That's kind of
what I'm getting at.

00:18:29.470 --> 00:18:33.770
There's this first step that is,
we show something amazing,

00:18:33.770 --> 00:18:35.720
and it has that next--

00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:36.640
NAVAL RAVIKANT: But don't shoot
yourself in the foot by

00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:38.543
saying we're going to
build something

00:18:38.543 --> 00:18:39.900
medium size or small.

00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:40.520
That's a huge warning signal.

00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:41.340
RICH MINER: By the way,
large can be relative

00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:42.560
to a market, too.

00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:44.710
The market doesn't need to be
everybody in this room.

00:18:44.710 --> 00:18:47.740
But if you can say, there are
these people, they need x.

00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:49.550
We think we can get
90% of those guys.

00:18:49.550 --> 00:18:52.040
I mean again, there's ways of
saying we're going to crush

00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:53.610
this and then grow from there.

00:18:53.610 --> 00:18:56.690
But you want to use that
terminology, not the not

00:18:56.690 --> 00:18:57.500
aiming high.

00:18:57.500 --> 00:19:01.560
KEVIN ROSE: And I think that
I've seen several times that

00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:03.700
different angel investors put
money into things that they're

00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:05.310
personally passionate about.

00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:07.530
And oftentimes it doesn't have
to be a big business it's just

00:19:07.530 --> 00:19:10.800
something like I know a buddy
of mine has a ramen shop.

00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:12.630
And he got a bunch of tech angel
investors to put money

00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:13.380
in the ramen shot.

00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:14.916
They're not trying to make
a billion dollar

00:19:14.916 --> 00:19:15.620
off the ramen shop.

00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:17.370
They just like the
idea, right?

00:19:17.370 --> 00:19:20.190
So if you can find those like
minded investors, that's

00:19:20.190 --> 00:19:22.340
another potential
avenue for you.

00:19:22.340 --> 00:19:26.250
The other thing, too, is
sometimes you just don't need

00:19:26.250 --> 00:19:26.540
investment.

00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:28.480
I mean you can do
this yourself.

00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:31.600
I created a little service
called We Follow that was a

00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:34.070
directory for Twitter
users early on.

00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:37.500
And it grew to over a million
users adding all their tags

00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:38.930
and credentials to it.

00:19:38.930 --> 00:19:42.370
And I had some people approach
me saying, do you want to take

00:19:42.370 --> 00:19:43.070
some money for this?

00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:44.500
And I'm like, no I
don't want to.

00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:45.890
This is just a little hobby.

00:19:45.890 --> 00:19:46.980
It's running on two servers.

00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:50.340
And it ended up, I slapped on
some AdSense ads, and it makes

00:19:50.340 --> 00:19:53.010
a couple thousand dollars a
month and pays for awesome

00:19:53.010 --> 00:19:54.460
dinners and uber cab rides.

00:19:54.460 --> 00:19:55.520
And that's what it does.

00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:58.150
And it's awesome, and there's
no employees.

00:19:58.150 --> 00:20:01.200
So that's always a potential
way to go as well.

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:02.230
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:20:02.230 --> 00:20:03.620
RICH MINER: Over here.

00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:05.540
AUDIENCE: I've heard you guys
talk about team and the

00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:07.760
importance of people
and different

00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:08.920
characteristics of people.

00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:12.910
Where does education fall into
that, be it formal informal?

00:20:12.910 --> 00:20:16.560
When you view and you talk to
somebody and you talk about

00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:20.280
their background a little bit,
where do you put an education,

00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:22.580
the importance of their
education, and again, be

00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:25.170
informal and formal?

00:20:25.170 --> 00:20:27.090
RICH MINER: Now for me
that's a hard one.

00:20:27.090 --> 00:20:33.080
I mean I funded college dropouts
that just again

00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:35.610
seemed to be wiser than
their years and

00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:38.220
their education status.

00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:41.195
I work near MIT, but I'm a
graduate of UMass Lowell

00:20:41.195 --> 00:20:43.390
school system.

00:20:43.390 --> 00:20:48.240
So to me it's really the
person, and it's

00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:50.210
how smart they are.

00:20:50.210 --> 00:20:54.840
And to me that's something that
is potentially influenced

00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:58.120
by degree but really can be
street smarts as well.

00:20:58.120 --> 00:21:02.850
So again I think what you don't
want to do is is not

00:21:02.850 --> 00:21:05.410
show that you're not educated
in a space you're

00:21:05.410 --> 00:21:06.310
trying to get into.

00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:08.630
If you're trying to build
something technically complex

00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:11.040
from a computer science
standpoint, I want to see

00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:12.770
somebody that has some--

00:21:12.770 --> 00:21:16.530
to me it's a red flag if there
isn't somebody that has strong

00:21:16.530 --> 00:21:19.130
computer science fundamental
background.

00:21:19.130 --> 00:21:22.180
And so again I think it's
somewhat adaptable to the

00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:24.110
particular opportunity.

00:21:24.110 --> 00:21:26.000
But if you're passionate about
something, you've built a

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:29.195
group that you think is
absolutely capable of crushing

00:21:29.195 --> 00:21:31.990
it in an area and that they've
got skills that you think you

00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:35.500
can convince people, pedigree in
my mind isn't as important

00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:37.760
as being able to convince
people of those previous

00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:38.490
attributes I mentioned.

00:21:38.490 --> 00:21:40.550
DON DODGE: Bill Gates
dropped out.

00:21:40.550 --> 00:21:42.740
He did OK.

00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:48.610
Sean Fanning, he attended one
semester of college and he

00:21:48.610 --> 00:21:51.150
dropped out, and he's
done OK, too.

00:21:51.150 --> 00:21:55.500
So it's more about the passion,
and the drive, and

00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:59.200
getting things done than it is
a piece of paper from some

00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:00.320
university.

00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:03.310
NAVAL RAVIKANT: Education is one
those weird markets where

00:22:03.310 --> 00:22:07.250
sort of the least educated
people are often the least

00:22:07.250 --> 00:22:07.580
intelligence.

00:22:07.580 --> 00:22:09.990
But that's correlation,
not causation.

00:22:09.990 --> 00:22:11.760
And then you've got a set
of people who are highly

00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:12.955
intelligent and highly
educated.

00:22:12.955 --> 00:22:14.960
And at the top there's
the most intelligent.

00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:16.660
They're usually the least
educated again.

00:22:16.660 --> 00:22:18.350
So they get confused with
that other bundle.

00:22:18.350 --> 00:22:20.320
So you can't use it as
a filter function.

00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:21.820
But you can use it
as a signal.

00:22:21.820 --> 00:22:24.620
So what you really want to see
is you want to see evidence of

00:22:24.620 --> 00:22:26.460
intelligence and drive
bundled together.

00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:30.250
One way could be 3.9 at MIT in
double E. Another way could

00:22:30.250 --> 00:22:32.740
be, dropped out of school, did
some amazing open source

00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:34.700
project, got a million
followers, right?

00:22:34.700 --> 00:22:36.830
So it's just a signal.

00:22:36.830 --> 00:22:37.810
It's data.

00:22:37.810 --> 00:22:38.850
DON DODGE: Over here.

00:22:38.850 --> 00:22:41.060
AUDIENCE: Thank you a lot of
us in the room are starting

00:22:41.060 --> 00:22:42.170
mobile app companies.

00:22:42.170 --> 00:22:46.160
And I was wondering, when do
you guys like to invest in

00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:49.400
seed rounds as far as the
product life cycle?

00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:53.230
Do you like when it's just
screenshots, clickable demo,

00:22:53.230 --> 00:22:55.540
out in the market, first beta?

00:22:55.540 --> 00:22:57.310
When should we really
go and try and raise

00:22:57.310 --> 00:22:59.550
that first seed round?

00:22:59.550 --> 00:23:00.970
DON DODGE: Good question.

00:23:00.970 --> 00:23:01.770
RICH MINER: I mean I'll
give you my--

00:23:01.770 --> 00:23:04.490
I mean to me it's a very hard
question to answer, because

00:23:04.490 --> 00:23:06.870
it's almost different
every single time.

00:23:06.870 --> 00:23:09.890
I mean certainly if it's a
repeat entrepreneur, which you

00:23:09.890 --> 00:23:11.750
probably wouldn't be in this
case, they might have money

00:23:11.750 --> 00:23:15.530
chasing them before they have
some sketches down.

00:23:15.530 --> 00:23:18.980
It really comes back to the
people and what you get from

00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:20.860
them in terms of what
they're building.

00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:25.040
And that can maybe just be
conveyed with some sketches,

00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:27.260
and a passionate group, and a
picture of what they want to

00:23:27.260 --> 00:23:28.770
build and where they
want to take it.

00:23:28.770 --> 00:23:31.030
And they're able to articulate
that clearly.

00:23:31.030 --> 00:23:34.070
Some people they might speak all
the words, but you can't

00:23:34.070 --> 00:23:35.005
get that image in your mind.

00:23:35.005 --> 00:23:38.000
And you really do need we need
to see a functional prototype

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:39.460
about what they're
talking about.

00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:41.500
Sometimes with a functional
prototype you're still not

00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:45.620
convinced that that's going to
capture the consumer's appeal,

00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:47.490
and you actually want to see
it out in the market and

00:23:47.490 --> 00:23:48.960
gathering some traction.

00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:52.650
But literally it's all across
that spectrum for me, and it's

00:23:52.650 --> 00:23:53.900
case by case.

00:23:55.770 --> 00:23:58.850
AUDIENCE: Because I think we
hear a lot about traction, how

00:23:58.850 --> 00:24:00.210
important traction is.

00:24:00.210 --> 00:24:03.560
And, come back to me when you
have traction is something

00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:05.040
that I think is said a lot.

00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:06.920
And I just was wondering how
much truth there is to that

00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:10.980
and is it bad for us to go up
and try and raise a round when

00:24:10.980 --> 00:24:11.930
we don't have any
traction because

00:24:11.930 --> 00:24:12.450
we're not in the market?

00:24:12.450 --> 00:24:14.560
RICH MINER: I think you should
always trying to find somebody

00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:17.940
and say, look can you just take
a look at what I'm doing.

00:24:17.940 --> 00:24:18.780
I'm not pitching you.

00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:19.810
This is a friendly meeting.

00:24:19.810 --> 00:24:21.260
Can you give me feedback?

00:24:21.260 --> 00:24:23.490
And I bet you will find
people willing to

00:24:23.490 --> 00:24:24.310
give you some feedback.

00:24:24.310 --> 00:24:27.200
KEVIN ROSE: I think come back
when you have traction is a

00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:29.580
fancy way of just saying, I
don't believe in what you're

00:24:29.580 --> 00:24:32.710
building right now.

00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:35.430
I think that it's nice to have
a working prototype,

00:24:35.430 --> 00:24:37.300
especially given how fast--

00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:39.060
if you can prototype something
up real quick, it doesn't

00:24:39.060 --> 00:24:41.960
matter if it's on the app store
or not, if it's just

00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:42.920
working on your phone.

00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:44.830
And it's also a great
way to pitch people.

00:24:44.830 --> 00:24:49.700
I've had people come up to me
at a bar or a function, or

00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:51.770
something like that and
say, hey I need 30

00:24:51.770 --> 00:24:52.030
seconds of your time.

00:24:52.030 --> 00:24:53.050
I just want to show you
this app real quick.

00:24:53.050 --> 00:24:55.320
And if it's something I can
look at rather than like

00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:57.510
whispering over, so
my idea is this.

00:24:57.510 --> 00:25:00.030
It's like it's so much better
to play with it.

00:25:00.030 --> 00:25:02.560
So if you can build something,
even if there's no back end

00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:04.596
associated with that to where
you can just walk through it

00:25:04.596 --> 00:25:07.470
with your fingers,
I mean do that.

00:25:07.470 --> 00:25:07.800
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:11.240
DON DODGE: Great, over here.

00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:13.310
AUDIENCE: So coming from an
East Coast, Massachusetts

00:25:13.310 --> 00:25:17.300
suburbs and not really knowing
any VCs or ins in a Silicon

00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:20.235
Valley-esque area, what would
you suggest for a path in

00:25:20.235 --> 00:25:24.350
getting your idea recognized by
VCs or mentors who can help

00:25:24.350 --> 00:25:26.530
out with getting your
idea right on track?

00:25:26.530 --> 00:25:28.340
I know I'm probably not
alone in a unique

00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:29.810
situation or anything.

00:25:29.810 --> 00:25:33.110
But just seeing myself and my
friends, we want to make

00:25:33.110 --> 00:25:34.550
something really cool.

00:25:34.550 --> 00:25:37.410
What would you suggest?

00:25:37.410 --> 00:25:39.490
NAVAL RAVIKANT: It sounds
stupid, but build something

00:25:39.490 --> 00:25:41.530
really cool and the world will
beat a path to your door.

00:25:41.530 --> 00:25:43.490
I really think that, especially
in Silicon Valley.

00:25:43.490 --> 00:25:46.400
Because if you're in the venture
or the angel business,

00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:49.270
you're hunting for great
people and great ideas.

00:25:49.270 --> 00:25:51.190
If you're going around, to
Kevin's point, if you're

00:25:51.190 --> 00:25:53.040
yelling your idea in a crowded
bar, that's not going to get

00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:54.250
you very far.

00:25:54.250 --> 00:25:55.960
If you're walking around with
something really cool that

00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:57.310
people are crowding around,
that's going to

00:25:57.310 --> 00:25:58.460
get you pretty far.

00:25:58.460 --> 00:26:01.050
If someone downloads something
of yours off the app store and

00:26:01.050 --> 00:26:02.510
they're like wow, this is
a really great app,

00:26:02.510 --> 00:26:03.590
they'll call you.

00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:05.710
So the best way to get
noticed is just to

00:26:05.710 --> 00:26:07.150
build something great.

00:26:07.150 --> 00:26:10.030
I have never gone out and tried
to raise a dollar for

00:26:10.030 --> 00:26:10.470
Angel List.

00:26:10.470 --> 00:26:13.450
I get offers all day long,
because I just keep working on

00:26:13.450 --> 00:26:15.580
it, and the offers
keep coming in.

00:26:15.580 --> 00:26:17.695
So I know that sounds very
much like build it

00:26:17.695 --> 00:26:18.260
and they will come.

00:26:18.260 --> 00:26:20.400
But in the case of Silicon
Valley investors, it actually

00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:21.700
is very much true.

00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:24.300
That said, you can't walk 20
feet here without tripping

00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:25.810
over an investor.

00:26:25.810 --> 00:26:28.240
And you have lots and lots of
connections in common with

00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:29.750
them or you'll form
them very quickly.

00:26:29.750 --> 00:26:31.850
You ask path, one of the things
we do on Angel List is

00:26:31.850 --> 00:26:34.620
you come in, you connect your
social networks, and we show

00:26:34.620 --> 00:26:36.790
you your six degrees of
separation path to any

00:26:36.790 --> 00:26:37.940
investor on the site.

00:26:37.940 --> 00:26:40.400
So you can figure out who you
have in common, LinkedIn,

00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:42.070
Twitter, Facebook, whatever.

00:26:42.070 --> 00:26:44.080
So you can always get there, but
I would say focus on the

00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:45.800
product first and investment
second.

00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:48.200
The investment will come when
the product is ready.

00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:49.780
KEVIN ROSE: I would also throw
in there that when you're

00:26:49.780 --> 00:26:52.380
building your product, do it
in a social environment.

00:26:52.380 --> 00:26:54.580
Like head out to some of these
coffee shops in San Francisco

00:26:54.580 --> 00:26:56.310
that everyone gathers around.

00:26:56.310 --> 00:26:58.510
I mean there's so many start-ups
around here just

00:26:58.510 --> 00:27:01.110
like in coffee shops, meeting
each other, hanging out.

00:27:01.110 --> 00:27:03.020
There's social events that
happen all the time.

00:27:03.020 --> 00:27:04.690
Get on some of these
calendars.

00:27:04.690 --> 00:27:06.180
Look at some of these different
start-up groups and

00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:09.100
organizations that are out
there and just network.

00:27:09.100 --> 00:27:11.270
You really have to network
and meet new people.

00:27:11.270 --> 00:27:13.505
And you'll be connected up with
angels and the people

00:27:13.505 --> 00:27:17.450
that you want to know within
a month or two max.

00:27:17.450 --> 00:27:19.320
NAVAL RAVIKANT: The good news
is if you're a builder,

00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:21.020
there's more networkers
in the system

00:27:21.020 --> 00:27:21.920
than there are builders.

00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:26.170
It's like in biology where there
are more parasites than

00:27:26.170 --> 00:27:29.560
there are self-standing
host creatures.

00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:30.610
There's about six times
as many parasites.

00:27:30.610 --> 00:27:31.570
I'm not calling them parasites
necessarily.

00:27:31.570 --> 00:27:32.300
KEVIN ROSE: Are we the
parasites then?

00:27:32.300 --> 00:27:35.220
NAVAL RAVIKANT: Yeah, but
there's a lot more networkers

00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:36.670
in the system that there
are actually builders.

00:27:36.670 --> 00:27:37.640
There are a lot fewer
builders.

00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:38.450
It's like in Hollywood.

00:27:38.450 --> 00:27:40.740
There are a lot fewer actors and
directors than there are

00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:42.720
all surrounding support cast.

00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:44.720
So that support cast
will find you.

00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:46.680
If you're sitting in a coffee
shop and you're coding

00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:49.780
something up cool and showing
really neat demos, believe me,

00:27:49.780 --> 00:27:51.390
like 20 people will come
out of the woodwork.

00:27:51.390 --> 00:27:52.560
And your table will be full.

00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:53.790
And they'll be trying to figure
out how to help you,

00:27:53.790 --> 00:27:57.410
because all value in Silicon
Valley originates from the

00:27:57.410 --> 00:27:59.660
builders, and those are
the scarcest resource.

00:27:59.660 --> 00:28:02.510
So if you're a builder, the
ecosystem will find you.

00:28:02.510 --> 00:28:05.110
I think your problem is going
to be the opposite, which is

00:28:05.110 --> 00:28:07.780
going to be how to figure out
which network or connector to

00:28:07.780 --> 00:28:10.090
go through who doesn't like take
you to the wrong place,

00:28:10.090 --> 00:28:12.760
or isn't very smart, or tries
to take a cut, or screws up

00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:14.120
your company somehow.

00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:16.210
RICH MINER: So full disclosure,
I'm actually a

00:28:16.210 --> 00:28:17.480
Boston-based venture

00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:19.480
capitalist, not Silicon Valley.

00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:22.250
So I mean in your particular
case, just come

00:28:22.250 --> 00:28:23.660
into Boston, Cambridge.

00:28:23.660 --> 00:28:25.660
I mean all of the VCs
have moved back into

00:28:25.660 --> 00:28:26.400
the Cambridge area.

00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:28.110
It's a very dense, vibrant
environment

00:28:28.110 --> 00:28:29.500
around Kendall Square.

00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:31.950
Go online, check VentureFizz,
and some other resources.

00:28:31.950 --> 00:28:34.860
You'll see literally almost
every day of the week there

00:28:34.860 --> 00:28:37.300
are start-up meet-ups
in the evening or

00:28:37.300 --> 00:28:39.000
coffees in the morning.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:43.570
Bijan from Spark and Nabeel from
Spark do a venture coffee

00:28:43.570 --> 00:28:44.900
once a week.

00:28:44.900 --> 00:28:47.050
They're not always there, but
there typically are other VCs

00:28:47.050 --> 00:28:47.710
and other start-ups.

00:28:47.710 --> 00:28:51.600
So Boston is a pretty vibrant
start-up environment that's

00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:53.970
typically number 2 to Silicon
Valley historically.

00:28:53.970 --> 00:28:57.560
So head into town, and you'll
meet up with people.

00:28:57.560 --> 00:29:00.610
DON DODGE: I have two pieces
of advice for you.

00:29:00.610 --> 00:29:05.100
Number one, the best path to
starting a start-up is to work

00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:06.270
at a start-up.

00:29:06.270 --> 00:29:10.550
So the first thing I would
do is join a start-up.

00:29:10.550 --> 00:29:13.010
Learn how a start-up
gets built.

00:29:13.010 --> 00:29:15.610
Learn how they attract
investors.

00:29:15.610 --> 00:29:17.240
Learn how they attract
customers.

00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:19.370
Learn how they attract
employees.

00:29:19.370 --> 00:29:21.310
Get into that ecosystem.

00:29:21.310 --> 00:29:25.210
That's the best training for
doing a start-up is to work at

00:29:25.210 --> 00:29:26.100
a start-up.

00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:29.310
The second way is network
with friends.

00:29:29.310 --> 00:29:33.110
Find friends who are working
at a start-up or who have

00:29:33.110 --> 00:29:38.030
started a company, and they will
lead you to investors and

00:29:38.030 --> 00:29:39.060
other people.

00:29:39.060 --> 00:29:41.780
So those are two
ways to do it.

00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:42.720
But Naval's right.

00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:46.490
If you're a builder, they will
just come and find you.

00:29:46.490 --> 00:29:46.920
Over here.

00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:47.350
AUDIENCE: Thank you so much.

00:29:47.350 --> 00:29:50.100
AUDIENCE: Thank you, I have a
start-up that is in the early

00:29:50.100 --> 00:29:54.060
traction stage and an investor
that has instructed me to go

00:29:54.060 --> 00:29:55.530
build a team.

00:29:55.530 --> 00:29:59.070
And I found it very difficult
to find people that are

00:29:59.070 --> 00:30:01.865
qualified and understand that
long-term commitment that you

00:30:01.865 --> 00:30:02.970
were talking Naval.

00:30:02.970 --> 00:30:05.240
Are there channels that
you can recommend.

00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:07.510
I kind of feel like sitting on
the sidewalk with a cardboard

00:30:07.510 --> 00:30:08.760
sign at this stage.

00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:13.540
NAVAL RAVIKANT: That's
a tough one.

00:30:13.540 --> 00:30:16.920
Yeah there's two things in a
start-up that matter, selling

00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:18.020
and building.

00:30:18.020 --> 00:30:20.640
And this is the hardest sales
thing right now, which is

00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:22.390
you've got to convince
people to join your

00:30:22.390 --> 00:30:24.010
vision and your dream.

00:30:24.010 --> 00:30:26.750
To Don's point, the reason why
I think it's so important to

00:30:26.750 --> 00:30:30.300
work in a start-up is to build
up a great alumni network.

00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:32.570
The people who have done the
best over the years are the

00:30:32.570 --> 00:30:35.460
ones who just had incredible
alumni networks coming out.

00:30:35.460 --> 00:30:37.340
Look at what the early Googlers
went on to do or what

00:30:37.340 --> 00:30:40.300
the Paypal mafia went on to
do, just unbelievable.

00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:42.980
So I would say you have to reach
back into your start-up

00:30:42.980 --> 00:30:44.960
alumni networks.

00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:47.100
Other than that, I can tell you
when I started Angel List

00:30:47.100 --> 00:30:48.610
it was a [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:48.610 --> 00:30:50.035
Try recruiting an engineer
into that.

00:30:50.035 --> 00:30:52.670
It's like the least exciting
thing on the planet.

00:30:52.670 --> 00:30:56.070
You've got a user base of 25
people running a mailing list.

00:30:56.070 --> 00:30:58.550
But the reality is just as you
build it up, it will get

00:30:58.550 --> 00:30:59.600
easier and easier to recruit.

00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:01.850
Now we turn away candidates.

00:31:01.850 --> 00:31:05.210
So it's just, you got
to build traction.

00:31:05.210 --> 00:31:07.160
So you can look at your
alumni networks.

00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:08.870
You can build traction.

00:31:08.870 --> 00:31:11.210
By the way, the code from this
investor saying you've got to

00:31:11.210 --> 00:31:14.000
build a team might just be,
I don't believe in you.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:15.220
So just--

00:31:15.220 --> 00:31:17.580
investors say no in many
different ways, because it's

00:31:17.580 --> 00:31:19.010
very hard to look at
someone and say--

00:31:19.010 --> 00:31:20.240
AUDIENCE: Actually, he's already
written a check.

00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:21.040
NAVAL RAVIKANT: So he's
written a check?

00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:21.530
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:31:21.530 --> 00:31:22.930
NAVAL RAVIKANT: OK,
that's good.

00:31:22.930 --> 00:31:25.160
So they do believe there.

00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:28.850
I guess this is part of the test
of being an entrepreneur.

00:31:28.850 --> 00:31:29.855
Can you recruit?

00:31:29.855 --> 00:31:31.940
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:31:31.940 --> 00:31:32.410
DON DODGE: Hold on a second.

00:31:32.410 --> 00:31:37.400
If you drill down on why team
is so important, if you look

00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:41.830
at why that's true, it's because
if you can attract

00:31:41.830 --> 00:31:45.140
another founder or two founders
who believe in your

00:31:45.140 --> 00:31:48.560
idea so much that they're
willing to stop what they're

00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:52.220
doing and join you, then that's
validation that your

00:31:52.220 --> 00:31:55.040
idea might have some legs.

00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:57.810
It's also when investors
look at that team.

00:31:57.810 --> 00:31:59.990
They say, wow here's two or
three guys that have had

00:31:59.990 --> 00:32:01.750
experience doing other things.

00:32:01.750 --> 00:32:04.820
They've come together to try
to make this idea work.

00:32:04.820 --> 00:32:06.500
It's additional validation.

00:32:06.500 --> 00:32:10.270
So that's why single founders
almost never get funded.

00:32:10.270 --> 00:32:10.650
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:32:10.650 --> 00:32:11.660
RICH MINER: I don't know what
you're building, but you

00:32:11.660 --> 00:32:12.820
mentioned you're getting
traction.

00:32:12.820 --> 00:32:15.580
So that's a network that you've
started to build.

00:32:15.580 --> 00:32:17.685
You might want to find some way
to leverage the community

00:32:17.685 --> 00:32:20.820
of people with whom your product
has traction with to

00:32:20.820 --> 00:32:23.940
let that community know
that you're hiring.

00:32:23.940 --> 00:32:24.380
AUDIENCE: That's a good point.

00:32:24.380 --> 00:32:29.950
KEVIN ROSE: I would say also
you have to go after--

00:32:29.950 --> 00:32:34.140
find individuals that you really
respect and hunt them

00:32:34.140 --> 00:32:36.150
down and convince them to
join your start-up.

00:32:36.150 --> 00:32:39.580
I did something very similar to
this when in 2004 I was a

00:32:39.580 --> 00:32:43.170
big fan of the Mozilla website,
and the Firefox work,

00:32:43.170 --> 00:32:44.500
and the Firefox logo.

00:32:44.500 --> 00:32:47.940
And I found out one of the guys
behind this, his name is

00:32:47.940 --> 00:32:50.580
Daniel Burka, and he lived in
Canada, and he was a designer.

00:32:50.580 --> 00:32:52.530
And he was doing a bunch
of design work.

00:32:52.530 --> 00:32:54.710
Mozilla was one of
his clients.

00:32:54.710 --> 00:32:57.080
And I finally got
a hold of him.

00:32:57.080 --> 00:32:59.640
And I was like, give me
a week of your time.

00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:00.720
I'll pay you.

00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:01.670
Come on as a freelancer.

00:33:01.670 --> 00:33:02.900
Give me a week of your time.

00:33:02.900 --> 00:33:05.700
I just want you think through
some of these issues, work on

00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:07.400
some of the usability
problems I'm having.

00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:09.550
And so we got together.

00:33:09.550 --> 00:33:10.440
He flew into San Francisco.

00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:12.420
We worked on some this stuff.

00:33:12.420 --> 00:33:13.220
We became friends.

00:33:13.220 --> 00:33:14.160
We had a lot of fun.

00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:15.370
I showed him around the city.

00:33:15.370 --> 00:33:16.440
He thought the city
was awesome.

00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:18.010
I convinced him to move
out here from Canada.

00:33:18.010 --> 00:33:20.590
We got him a visa, and he
joined the company.

00:33:20.590 --> 00:33:21.810
It was a long road.

00:33:21.810 --> 00:33:23.340
It was like a three or
four month process

00:33:23.340 --> 00:33:24.850
to make this happen.

00:33:24.850 --> 00:33:26.170
But it finally happened.

00:33:26.170 --> 00:33:28.966
So just find those rock stars
that you want to go after if

00:33:28.966 --> 00:33:29.610
you know of any.

00:33:29.610 --> 00:33:31.390
And hunt them down
and convince them

00:33:31.390 --> 00:33:33.730
to join your start-up.

00:33:33.730 --> 00:33:33.850
NAVAL RAVIKANT: I'm not
as good as Kevin.

00:33:33.850 --> 00:33:36.840
It takes me 6 to 12 months
to recruit somebody good.

00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:38.800
From the moment I identity them
and start courting them

00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:40.350
it's a 6 to 12 month process.

00:33:40.350 --> 00:33:42.840
And it's like you're trying to
get someone to break up with

00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:45.120
their significant other and
end their relationship.

00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:47.090
So you kind of have to wait
for the low point.

00:33:47.090 --> 00:33:49.276
And so you just have
to hang out there.

00:33:49.276 --> 00:33:50.030
Be friendly.

00:33:50.030 --> 00:33:50.670
Make them offers.

00:33:50.670 --> 00:33:51.580
Take them out for drinks.

00:33:51.580 --> 00:33:53.750
And then that month when they
happen to be having a bad

00:33:53.750 --> 00:33:56.950
time, then you swoop in.

00:33:56.950 --> 00:33:57.620
It's a long process.

00:33:57.620 --> 00:33:59.380
RICH MINER: And don't worry
about being shameless.

00:33:59.380 --> 00:34:03.370
Send candy, send the
spouse flowers.

00:34:03.370 --> 00:34:04.770
NAVAL RAVIKANT: I've had
to pitch spouses.

00:34:04.770 --> 00:34:07.860
Go in there with a PowerPoint
and pitch the spouse.

00:34:07.860 --> 00:34:09.226
AUDIENCE: Exactly, thank you.

00:34:09.226 --> 00:34:11.000
DON DODGE: We have lots of
questions out here, and I want

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:13.449
to make sure that we
get to all of them.

00:34:13.449 --> 00:34:16.070
So a couple of rules,
no commercials, no

00:34:16.070 --> 00:34:17.870
pitches, just questions.

00:34:17.870 --> 00:34:19.920
And try to make them short so
that we can get through as

00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:21.690
many as possible.

00:34:21.690 --> 00:34:23.280
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I
am from India.

00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:24.830
And I'm doing a start-up
there.

00:34:24.830 --> 00:34:27.270
Getting some traction, but when
I was listening to the

00:34:27.270 --> 00:34:31.980
panel, I heard you say that
there is this chain.

00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:33.010
The angels have to
sell to VCs.

00:34:33.010 --> 00:34:36.340
The VCs have to sell to the PEs,
and so on and so forth.

00:34:36.340 --> 00:34:40.420
Just wanted to ask this
question, is it better to

00:34:40.420 --> 00:34:44.060
raise angel in India, or will
it help if I actually raise

00:34:44.060 --> 00:34:45.330
angel in the US?

00:34:45.330 --> 00:34:46.880
And how do I go about it?

00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:50.445
Is Angel List OK with an Indian
trying to raise angel

00:34:50.445 --> 00:34:52.469
money in the US?

00:34:52.469 --> 00:34:53.980
NAVAL RAVIKANT: If you have
traction and you're based

00:34:53.980 --> 00:34:56.250
here, at least for some period
of time, like you're here for

00:34:56.250 --> 00:34:59.590
a month or two, you can raise
money from US investors.

00:34:59.590 --> 00:35:02.870
There are a lot of ex-Indian
origin angels

00:35:02.870 --> 00:35:04.030
now in the US area.

00:35:04.030 --> 00:35:06.370
So we can help there.

00:35:06.370 --> 00:35:08.400
But you need to have traction,
because people don't want to

00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:11.520
invest around the world unless
there's something there.

00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:12.880
You can also find
local investors.

00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:15.510
A company called Freshdesk
that raised money through

00:35:15.510 --> 00:35:18.210
Angel List that's in India
from Indian investors.

00:35:18.210 --> 00:35:18.850
So it happens.

00:35:18.850 --> 00:35:20.490
It's just rarer.

00:35:20.490 --> 00:35:23.000
And hopefully we'll get more
Indian investors on.

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:25.940
But I would say India is
probably geography number six

00:35:25.940 --> 00:35:28.350
or seven for us in
terms of volume.

00:35:28.350 --> 00:35:29.660
Obviously Silicon
Valley's huge.

00:35:29.660 --> 00:35:31.300
The fact that you're out here
already means you're on the

00:35:31.300 --> 00:35:32.080
right track.

00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:33.990
DON DODGE: You should
join TIE.

00:35:33.990 --> 00:35:35.600
Have you heard of TIE?

00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:36.660
AUDIENCE: I'm a member
of TIE, yes.

00:35:36.660 --> 00:35:39.810
DON DODGE: It's a good start.

00:35:39.810 --> 00:35:42.410
AUDIENCE: It's again question
about team.

00:35:42.410 --> 00:35:46.620
I several times didn't receive
money from angels, venture

00:35:46.620 --> 00:35:50.620
capitalists, because of
lack of the team.

00:35:50.620 --> 00:35:55.280
I'm inventor with several
inventions, many of them I

00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:57.040
think marketable.

00:35:57.040 --> 00:36:00.260
Right now I'm concentrated on
the one-off technologies, and

00:36:00.260 --> 00:36:02.300
we are a successful,
[INAUDIBLE].

00:36:02.300 --> 00:36:10.000
But line of technologies waiting
for entrepreneurs.

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:14.000
Same I have a lot of same
crazy inventors.

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:19.460
They not able raise money
because of lack of the team.

00:36:19.460 --> 00:36:24.360
My question is, you have any
institution like venture

00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:28.580
entrepreneurs like venture
capitalists?

00:36:28.580 --> 00:36:32.880
And something that maybe
even could be another

00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:34.390
idea for your venture?

00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:41.430
RICH MINER: I mean I think in a
lot of VCs' minds there's a

00:36:41.430 --> 00:36:43.700
big difference between an
inventor and an entrepreneur.

00:36:43.700 --> 00:36:46.630
And it sounds like you've
stumbled on that, because I

00:36:46.630 --> 00:36:52.200
think just the idea itself
without the passion and the

00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:54.640
understanding as to how you're
going to get that to blossom

00:36:54.640 --> 00:36:58.630
within some community
is a big gap.

00:36:58.630 --> 00:37:02.830
One thing you might want to do
is this is where being around

00:37:02.830 --> 00:37:05.170
some of the business schools
might be helpful, because

00:37:05.170 --> 00:37:07.400
there you often have people
that understand markets,

00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:10.130
commercialization, they have a
passion for doing a start-up.

00:37:10.130 --> 00:37:14.230
But they need the technical
idea, concept, invention, or

00:37:14.230 --> 00:37:15.900
something that they can
bring to market.

00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:18.130
So that might be one way to
start complementing some of

00:37:18.130 --> 00:37:20.930
the skills for the things that
you've put together and seeing

00:37:20.930 --> 00:37:23.616
if you can get somebody who has
that passion, fire in the

00:37:23.616 --> 00:37:24.890
belly, and some of the
education and the

00:37:24.890 --> 00:37:28.230
understanding as to how you make
a company out of that.

00:37:28.230 --> 00:37:33.090
AUDIENCE: Ask if any maybe
institution like I don't know

00:37:33.090 --> 00:37:40.580
that offering service as
entrepreneurs or that's could

00:37:40.580 --> 00:37:47.270
be a piece of the puzzle
necessary for the inventors.

00:37:47.270 --> 00:37:48.490
RICH MINER: The problem is
most entrepreneurs are

00:37:48.490 --> 00:37:51.130
passionate about
their own idea.

00:37:51.130 --> 00:37:53.760
DON DODGE: That's back to why
team is so important.

00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:55.840
Entrepreneurs are so passionate
about their own

00:37:55.840 --> 00:38:00.010
ideas, the hardest part is to
get somebody to drop their

00:38:00.010 --> 00:38:02.570
idea to join you on your idea.

00:38:02.570 --> 00:38:04.255
And then that's validation
that you have

00:38:04.255 --> 00:38:05.470
something really big.

00:38:05.470 --> 00:38:08.692
So without that, it's going
to be very difficult.

00:38:08.692 --> 00:38:09.950
AUDIENCE: OK, thank you.

00:38:09.950 --> 00:38:10.440
DON DODGE: Over here.

00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:12.640
AUDIENCE: I was wondering what
type of analysis do you do

00:38:12.640 --> 00:38:15.020
when a market is very large,
but the barrier of

00:38:15.020 --> 00:38:16.200
entry is very high.

00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:21.250
So something where there's a
lot of regulatory state and

00:38:21.250 --> 00:38:24.370
federal hurdles that you have to
go through, but the market

00:38:24.370 --> 00:38:28.080
is actually much bigger
than most markets.

00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:31.270
But the tech in that market
is actually very low.

00:38:31.270 --> 00:38:37.120
DON DODGE: Like health care
or energy or those areas?

00:38:37.120 --> 00:38:39.350
AUDIENCE: Yes, not actually
those areas but something--

00:38:39.350 --> 00:38:40.340
NAVAL RAVIKANT: Those kinds
of markets tend to have

00:38:40.340 --> 00:38:43.900
specialized investors who know
how to handicap the risks of

00:38:43.900 --> 00:38:46.020
the regulatory strategies.

00:38:46.020 --> 00:38:49.190
And most investors who are not
familiar with those markets

00:38:49.190 --> 00:38:50.350
tend not to go into that.

00:38:50.350 --> 00:38:54.430
That's why you have dedicated
clean tech VCs or biotech VCs.

00:38:54.430 --> 00:38:58.180
If no VC exists in that market,
like that market is

00:38:58.180 --> 00:39:00.810
literally that new, then you
have to go find other

00:39:00.810 --> 00:39:03.610
entrepreneurs or executives
who managed to crack that

00:39:03.610 --> 00:39:05.770
market before and might be
willing to be angels.

00:39:05.770 --> 00:39:08.330
But you just got to find people
with domain expertise.

00:39:08.330 --> 00:39:11.300
And you can use CrunchBase, or
Angel List, or Google and

00:39:11.300 --> 00:39:13.870
track down people.

00:39:13.870 --> 00:39:15.390
RICH MINER: Getting someone to
believe in you who has scaled

00:39:15.390 --> 00:39:18.080
of one of those walls before,
who has brought a product in

00:39:18.080 --> 00:39:20.960
front of the FDA before or
whatever to say, I'm now

00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:21.870
working with these guys.

00:39:21.870 --> 00:39:23.380
I believe in what they're doing,
and I can help them get

00:39:23.380 --> 00:39:24.000
over that hurdle.

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:25.840
That's probably what
you want to do.

00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:29.420
AUDIENCE: It's a market I've
been in for a long time, and

00:39:29.420 --> 00:39:32.140
it's definitely different
and outside of anything

00:39:32.140 --> 00:39:35.140
California-based or anything
that's very trendy.

00:39:35.140 --> 00:39:39.470
So just curious if you take
those types of risks and how

00:39:39.470 --> 00:39:41.970
you analyze those
types of risk.

00:39:41.970 --> 00:39:43.980
DON DODGE: There are investors
who do, but I don't

00:39:43.980 --> 00:39:47.280
think that's us.

00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:51.220
AUDIENCE: So what's the typical
range of investment at

00:39:51.220 --> 00:39:54.520
a seed round, and what do
investors want in return, like

00:39:54.520 --> 00:39:56.175
how much would they want?

00:39:59.060 --> 00:40:00.040
NAVAL RAVIKANT: Probably depend
on the company, but the

00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:03.820
averages these days for what's
called a seed round is around

00:40:03.820 --> 00:40:09.065
250K to a million and normally
sell about 20% of a company.

00:40:09.065 --> 00:40:10.640
DON DODGE: Good answer.

00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:11.510
Over here.

00:40:11.510 --> 00:40:12.880
AUDIENCE: I have a
quick two part.

00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:15.670
So if you feel like you
do have a great team.

00:40:15.670 --> 00:40:17.460
You've got a disruptive idea.

00:40:17.460 --> 00:40:19.240
But you're going into market
where there are big

00:40:19.240 --> 00:40:21.660
competitors that could copy
quickly and adopt to that

00:40:21.660 --> 00:40:24.440
idea, what would be your
recommendation for that

00:40:24.440 --> 00:40:27.590
company in terms of posting for
crowdsourcing, posting to

00:40:27.590 --> 00:40:29.600
Angel List, trying to
find it that way?

00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:31.110
And then if you guys have time
at the end, what's the

00:40:31.110 --> 00:40:35.895
craziest pitch you've gotten
from an entrepreneur or the

00:40:35.895 --> 00:40:38.400
craziest way they've gotten a
hold of you to do that pitch?

00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:40.320
RICH MINER: On your first point,
I just find people

00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:42.340
don't copy quickly.

00:40:42.340 --> 00:40:43.300
I'd just go for it.

00:40:43.300 --> 00:40:44.930
If you think it's a big idea
and you have a great team,

00:40:44.930 --> 00:40:47.230
first of all send Kevin
or I an email.

00:40:49.730 --> 00:40:51.680
But just go for it.

00:40:51.680 --> 00:40:52.540
NAVAL RAVIKANT: You're going to
have the opposite problem.

00:40:52.540 --> 00:40:53.970
The problem you're going to have
is going to be shouting

00:40:53.970 --> 00:40:55.710
your product and idea from
the rooftops and

00:40:55.710 --> 00:40:56.490
nobody will want it.

00:40:56.490 --> 00:40:59.880
That's the most likely case.

00:40:59.880 --> 00:41:02.020
I have even gone through the
whole secrecy thing as an

00:41:02.020 --> 00:41:04.310
entrepreneur myself, and I
always regret it later,

00:41:04.310 --> 00:41:07.030
because all it does is it slows
down the process of

00:41:07.030 --> 00:41:09.270
getting partners, getting
customers, getting investors,

00:41:09.270 --> 00:41:10.370
getting feedback.

00:41:10.370 --> 00:41:12.890
And the reality is if your
idea truly can be copied

00:41:12.890 --> 00:41:16.360
easily, and if big companies are
somehow inclined to copy

00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:17.910
it easily, and if somehow they
can get through their

00:41:17.910 --> 00:41:19.860
bureaucracy and priorities
and do it,

00:41:19.860 --> 00:41:20.710
then you're dead anyway.

00:41:20.710 --> 00:41:23.000
So figure that out sooner
rather than later.

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:24.890
Figure that out in one year
instead of 10 years.

00:41:24.890 --> 00:41:29.350
DON DODGE: That's a huge point,
that some first-time

00:41:29.350 --> 00:41:30.780
entrepreneurs miss.

00:41:30.780 --> 00:41:33.060
They try to keep their
idea secret.

00:41:33.060 --> 00:41:35.680
Or they ask people
to sign NDAs.

00:41:35.680 --> 00:41:37.350
It's not going to happen.

00:41:37.350 --> 00:41:40.650
You want to shout your idea from
the rooftops to see who's

00:41:40.650 --> 00:41:42.150
going to be attracted to it.

00:41:42.150 --> 00:41:46.230
Don't worry about somebody
copying your idea.

00:41:46.230 --> 00:41:47.080
Two reasons--

00:41:47.080 --> 00:41:50.490
one is, as I said earlier,
entrepreneurs are passionate

00:41:50.490 --> 00:41:51.470
about their idea.

00:41:51.470 --> 00:41:53.140
They're totally focused
on their idea.

00:41:53.140 --> 00:41:54.830
They don't care what
your idea is.

00:41:54.830 --> 00:41:56.590
They care what their ideas is.

00:41:56.590 --> 00:42:00.570
So getting them to pay attention
to your idea is the

00:42:00.570 --> 00:42:02.240
hardest thing in the world.

00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:06.040
Don't worry about big companies
copying your idea.

00:42:06.040 --> 00:42:09.470
Google has a list of thousands
of ideas that we

00:42:09.470 --> 00:42:11.670
have yet to get to.

00:42:11.670 --> 00:42:13.140
They aren't going to drop--

00:42:13.140 --> 00:42:15.230
RICH MINER: And even some
of the ones we have.

00:42:15.230 --> 00:42:19.370
DON DODGE: Yes so, big companies
don't copy other

00:42:19.370 --> 00:42:23.080
ideas very often, because they
have a million ideas

00:42:23.080 --> 00:42:24.700
themselves that they want
to get to that they

00:42:24.700 --> 00:42:26.350
don't have time for.

00:42:26.350 --> 00:42:28.915
NAVAL RAVIKANT: I would say
that out of 10 or 15,000

00:42:28.915 --> 00:42:31.290
pitches that we've reviewed at
Angel List in the last two

00:42:31.290 --> 00:42:33.320
years, which is probably the
most of any human on the

00:42:33.320 --> 00:42:36.810
planet, we've probably seen two
or three unique ideas and

00:42:36.810 --> 00:42:39.030
not in a good way.

00:42:39.030 --> 00:42:40.710
KEVIN ROSE: I think that
features get copied.

00:42:40.710 --> 00:42:42.480
Ideas really don't get copied.

00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:45.720
You see a lot of different
innovation on little tiny

00:42:45.720 --> 00:42:47.720
features, pull to refresh,
whatever it may be.

00:42:47.720 --> 00:42:50.690
And all of a sudden a big
company will see that, say oh

00:42:50.690 --> 00:42:53.450
that's interesting, that fits
into what we're doing.

00:42:53.450 --> 00:42:55.510
And then if it's easy to
implement, they'll do that.

00:42:55.510 --> 00:43:00.550
But if it's really an idea, a
unique big idea, I agree, big

00:43:00.550 --> 00:43:03.683
companies don't move
that fast.

00:43:03.683 --> 00:43:04.590
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:43:04.590 --> 00:43:09.850
AUDIENCE: So you've made some
analogies to marriage and

00:43:09.850 --> 00:43:10.880
creating a start-up.

00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:14.060
As someone who's married,
someone who's working at a

00:43:14.060 --> 00:43:17.070
successful company who makes a
pretty good living, can you

00:43:17.070 --> 00:43:21.660
give any advice of how you can
determine if you really should

00:43:21.660 --> 00:43:25.720
throw yourself into this pet
of a start-up, because I'm

00:43:25.720 --> 00:43:27.190
somewhat paralyzed with--

00:43:27.190 --> 00:43:29.490
I'm confident I have an idea
that I think could be

00:43:29.490 --> 00:43:30.010
successful.

00:43:30.010 --> 00:43:32.670
But I'm standing kind of at the
edge, and I don't know how

00:43:32.670 --> 00:43:33.960
to jump into that.

00:43:33.960 --> 00:43:35.170
NAVAL RAVIKANT: It's
like marriage.

00:43:35.170 --> 00:43:36.860
If you have to think about
it, the answer is no.

00:43:36.860 --> 00:43:41.170
DON DODGE: Exactly right, it
is exactly like marriage.

00:43:41.170 --> 00:43:44.690
If you can't think about
anything else, if you can't

00:43:44.690 --> 00:43:48.910
imagine not moving forward with
this person or with this

00:43:48.910 --> 00:43:51.790
idea, that's when you
get married, that's

00:43:51.790 --> 00:43:52.920
when you start a company.

00:43:52.920 --> 00:43:55.470
If you're not totally convinced
and totally

00:43:55.470 --> 00:44:00.960
passionate, don't get married
and don't start a company.

00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:02.350
KEVIN ROSE: You could approach
it like dating, though, and

00:44:02.350 --> 00:44:03.600
just do it on the
side at night.

00:44:10.560 --> 00:44:15.090
AUDIENCE: The thing is I'm
married, have two kids.

00:44:15.090 --> 00:44:16.160
It's really the--

00:44:16.160 --> 00:44:18.700
how do you sacrifice
the potential?

00:44:18.700 --> 00:44:20.360
You've got this potential in
front of you and you've got

00:44:20.360 --> 00:44:21.150
this stability.

00:44:21.150 --> 00:44:24.510
And it's trying to figure out,
is it worth dropping the

00:44:24.510 --> 00:44:26.800
stability for this huge risk?

00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:28.290
RICH MINER: I mean there's
definitely a risk trade-off.

00:44:28.290 --> 00:44:30.720
And it's harder when you're a
little bit further along in

00:44:30.720 --> 00:44:32.120
life and have the size.

00:44:32.120 --> 00:44:35.340
But I mean to Kevin's point, I
wouldn't take that lightly.

00:44:35.340 --> 00:44:36.510
You've got friends.

00:44:36.510 --> 00:44:37.240
You can get some
of other people

00:44:37.240 --> 00:44:38.480
passionate about the idea.

00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:41.550
As we've said up here before,
a lot of things can be built

00:44:41.550 --> 00:44:43.190
relatively easily these days.

00:44:43.190 --> 00:44:46.970
So depending on the nature of
whatever sort of NDAs you're

00:44:46.970 --> 00:44:49.940
under and things within your
company that you're currently

00:44:49.940 --> 00:44:53.070
employed by, if you can move
something along or have some

00:44:53.070 --> 00:44:54.690
other people that you're working
with help move it

00:44:54.690 --> 00:44:58.850
along, that will decrease the
risk potentially around the

00:44:58.850 --> 00:45:01.970
concept, because it'll maybe
start to get some traction or

00:45:01.970 --> 00:45:03.400
proof of concept.

00:45:03.400 --> 00:45:05.990
And if you can get your
threshold to where, Yeah now I

00:45:05.990 --> 00:45:06.630
really see it.

00:45:06.630 --> 00:45:07.710
Now I feel like I can do it.

00:45:07.710 --> 00:45:09.890
Now I do feel like I can jump
from what I'm doing to go

00:45:09.890 --> 00:45:11.910
raise some money for that, it's
a good way to get over

00:45:11.910 --> 00:45:12.940
that hurdle.

00:45:12.940 --> 00:45:14.730
AUDIENCE: Just do it then
is what you're saying.

00:45:14.730 --> 00:45:15.960
KEVIN ROSE: It sounds
like you have skills

00:45:15.960 --> 00:45:17.120
as a backup, right?

00:45:17.120 --> 00:45:19.240
So if this doesn't work out, you
can always go back to it.

00:45:19.240 --> 00:45:22.200
And when you're laying there on
your death bed at 90 years

00:45:22.200 --> 00:45:24.270
old, are you going to be pissed
that you took a leap

00:45:24.270 --> 00:45:26.160
and tried something
crazy and fun?

00:45:26.160 --> 00:45:27.980
Probably not, right?

00:45:27.980 --> 00:45:28.410
Go do it.

00:45:28.410 --> 00:45:28.766
AUDIENCE: Just do it, right.

00:45:28.766 --> 00:45:29.480
Thanks.

00:45:29.480 --> 00:45:31.270
DON DODGE: So let me just add
on that point, because I get

00:45:31.270 --> 00:45:35.310
this question at least once a
week, where someone has a

00:45:35.310 --> 00:45:38.400
great idea, and they say they
have a few friends that are

00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:41.860
working with them nights and
weekends to do things.

00:45:41.860 --> 00:45:45.500
And they say, if I could only
raise money, then I could

00:45:45.500 --> 00:45:47.520
convince them all to
quit their jobs

00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:48.720
and go do the thing.

00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:50.750
It happens every week.

00:45:50.750 --> 00:45:54.670
And I tell them, look from an
investor point of view, if you

00:45:54.670 --> 00:45:58.080
aren't passionate about it, if
you don't believe in it enough

00:45:58.080 --> 00:46:01.310
to quit your job and go do it,
why should I believe in it?

00:46:01.310 --> 00:46:03.990
Why should I give you my money
if you don't even believe in

00:46:03.990 --> 00:46:07.100
it enough to jump into
it and do it?

00:46:07.100 --> 00:46:09.220
So think about that.

00:46:09.220 --> 00:46:11.990
NAVAL RAVIKANT: At least from
your own personal payback as

00:46:11.990 --> 00:46:13.440
an entrepreneur, you have to
be process focused, not

00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:14.510
outcome focused.

00:46:14.510 --> 00:46:15.950
Otherwise it's like saying,
I'm getting

00:46:15.950 --> 00:46:16.900
married to have kids.

00:46:16.900 --> 00:46:18.510
My kids better go to Harvard.

00:46:18.510 --> 00:46:20.170
If I get married to you and our
kids don't go to Harvard

00:46:20.170 --> 00:46:21.700
I'll be really disappointed.

00:46:21.700 --> 00:46:23.620
So it's sort of a ludicrous
thing to just

00:46:23.620 --> 00:46:24.340
go for the end goal.

00:46:24.340 --> 00:46:27.640
You literally have to enjoy the
process, because most of

00:46:27.640 --> 00:46:29.876
the time it will end in tears.

00:46:29.876 --> 00:46:31.960
So you better have fun
along the way.

00:46:31.960 --> 00:46:36.400
And if you're outcome focused,
then I wouldn't do it.

00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:37.890
And that's not judgmental.

00:46:37.890 --> 00:46:40.910
I've been outcome focused
most of my life.

00:46:40.910 --> 00:46:43.340
But you're going to end
up in a bad place.

00:46:46.210 --> 00:46:47.310
AUDIENCE: So you guys
have done a lot of

00:46:47.310 --> 00:46:49.040
talking about start-ups.

00:46:49.040 --> 00:46:51.910
And from what I've seen you guys
investing in, a lot of it

00:46:51.910 --> 00:46:55.280
seems to be consumer Internet
start-ups and things that are

00:46:55.280 --> 00:46:57.660
going to get mass market.

00:46:57.660 --> 00:47:00.700
But a lot of the stuff I've
worked on is kind of small

00:47:00.700 --> 00:47:03.800
business or indie dev focused
in that kind of market.

00:47:03.800 --> 00:47:05.040
How does that change
things when

00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:08.640
you're looking at investing?

00:47:08.640 --> 00:47:10.290
NAVAL RAVIKANT: There are tons
of start-ups out there.

00:47:10.290 --> 00:47:11.560
There are tons of them
getting funded.

00:47:11.560 --> 00:47:14.240
So I get this question
every panel.

00:47:14.240 --> 00:47:16.900
Somebody gets up and says, we're
doing enterprise and you

00:47:16.900 --> 00:47:19.980
guys only do consumer, and, oh,
woe is me, life is so hard

00:47:19.980 --> 00:47:20.620
at enterprise.

00:47:20.620 --> 00:47:22.730
Not true, life is harder
at consumer, because

00:47:22.730 --> 00:47:23.520
there's more of them.

00:47:23.520 --> 00:47:24.580
They're less differentiated.

00:47:24.580 --> 00:47:27.060
The few that are get funded
have breakout traction.

00:47:27.060 --> 00:47:29.680
And you're just seeing the
weight of solid evidence.

00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:31.370
Their hit rate might
be 1 and 100.

00:47:31.370 --> 00:47:32.060
Yours is 1 in 10.

00:47:32.060 --> 00:47:35.420
But there's so fewer of you that
you don't notice that.

00:47:35.420 --> 00:47:38.430
Look at the most celebrated
recent exit, Yammer, at 20

00:47:38.430 --> 00:47:41.940
times revenues, 1.2
billion in cash.

00:47:41.940 --> 00:47:48.220
A huge bidding war, private
market valuation has gone from

00:47:48.220 --> 00:47:51.115
$250 million a year ago to $500
million six months ago to

00:47:51.115 --> 00:47:53.490
a $1.2 billion exit.

00:47:53.490 --> 00:47:57.140
If you can't raise money in a
small business offering on the

00:47:57.140 --> 00:47:59.960
back of that, then I would argue
you're not building a

00:47:59.960 --> 00:48:01.920
good product.

00:48:01.920 --> 00:48:03.070
Don't let the market
hold you back.

00:48:03.070 --> 00:48:06.530
There are plenty of investors
who are looking for enterprise

00:48:06.530 --> 00:48:09.610
or small business or developer
facing products that know how

00:48:09.610 --> 00:48:11.470
to get traction and
can eventually end

00:48:11.470 --> 00:48:13.300
up in a large market.

00:48:13.300 --> 00:48:16.720
DON DODGE: I invest in
B2B businesses and

00:48:16.720 --> 00:48:18.400
enterprise type stuff.

00:48:18.400 --> 00:48:20.990
I would say enterprise is
where the money is.

00:48:20.990 --> 00:48:23.630
Consumer is where
the users are.

00:48:23.630 --> 00:48:25.480
You can be successful at both.

00:48:25.480 --> 00:48:29.930
But what we're seeing with
Yammer and some of the others

00:48:29.930 --> 00:48:33.920
is this fusion of consumer
and enterprise.

00:48:33.920 --> 00:48:35.990
So social enterprise
if you will.

00:48:35.990 --> 00:48:37.980
Huge opportunities there.

00:48:37.980 --> 00:48:40.430
You get the traction
from the consumers.

00:48:40.430 --> 00:48:42.520
You get the money from
the enterprise.

00:48:42.520 --> 00:48:45.650
Huge opportunities for any kinds
of companies that are

00:48:45.650 --> 00:48:48.915
taking enterprise software and
leveraging consumer aspects.

00:48:51.580 --> 00:48:53.230
AUDIENCE: So we keep talking
about risk management.

00:48:53.230 --> 00:48:54.233
It's all about risk
management.

00:48:54.233 --> 00:48:57.000
We talk about money to reduce
risk what we're doing.

00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:00.280
Can you speak about more things
that VC firms provide

00:49:00.280 --> 00:49:01.050
besides capital.

00:49:01.050 --> 00:49:02.950
That's just like the main thing
we focus on nowadays.

00:49:02.950 --> 00:49:06.140
Like TechCrunch says so and so
got x amount of dollars and

00:49:06.140 --> 00:49:08.260
whatever, but they don't talk
about the other aspects to it.

00:49:08.260 --> 00:49:10.240
I think most people are not
aware about what I should get

00:49:10.240 --> 00:49:13.030
from a VC firm besides cash.

00:49:13.030 --> 00:49:15.190
RICH MINER: And by the way I
think that's a great point.

00:49:15.190 --> 00:49:18.090
As much as you're out raising
money, you should also be

00:49:18.090 --> 00:49:20.640
interviewing the people who you
take money from and make

00:49:20.640 --> 00:49:23.520
sure that you're taking money
from people who are going to

00:49:23.520 --> 00:49:24.360
be good money--

00:49:24.360 --> 00:49:26.530
at least not a problem
for you.

00:49:26.530 --> 00:49:27.960
And hopefully are going
to be able to help

00:49:27.960 --> 00:49:28.650
and add some value.

00:49:28.650 --> 00:49:31.060
Most VCs minimally are going to
be able to write a check,

00:49:31.060 --> 00:49:34.030
have some knowledge from their
past experience and also have

00:49:34.030 --> 00:49:35.110
a good network.

00:49:35.110 --> 00:49:37.170
In the case of Google Ventures,
we also have a bunch

00:49:37.170 --> 00:49:39.500
of vertical domains of
expertise, some great guys

00:49:39.500 --> 00:49:40.860
that are super good at--

00:49:40.860 --> 00:49:42.760
we have a whole design practice
that helps our

00:49:42.760 --> 00:49:45.540
portfolio companies build
brilliant, beautiful, simple,

00:49:45.540 --> 00:49:46.660
easy to use products.

00:49:46.660 --> 00:49:49.060
We have recruiters that help
our portfolio companies

00:49:49.060 --> 00:49:52.430
recruit in new engineers
onto their team.

00:49:52.430 --> 00:49:55.810
We have architects and platform
specialists who help

00:49:55.810 --> 00:49:59.010
our companies build Google
scale products, because

00:49:59.010 --> 00:50:00.040
they've done that at Google.

00:50:00.040 --> 00:50:02.970
So we look at all the things
that Google has done well.

00:50:02.970 --> 00:50:04.890
And help our portfolio company
do all of those

00:50:04.890 --> 00:50:07.240
things really well.

00:50:07.240 --> 00:50:10.450
All VCs have varying degrees
of some value add

00:50:10.450 --> 00:50:11.170
that they can bring.

00:50:11.170 --> 00:50:13.790
But you should definitely dig in
to what they're going to do

00:50:13.790 --> 00:50:15.960
to help you out and build
your company.

00:50:15.960 --> 00:50:17.950
AUDIENCE: So how do you narrow
down the VC firms?

00:50:17.950 --> 00:50:20.470
What things do you look for
besides the capital aspects?

00:50:20.470 --> 00:50:22.100
How do you help narrow
that down?

00:50:22.100 --> 00:50:25.480
Is there pre-defined general
guidelines to that?

00:50:25.480 --> 00:50:28.100
RICH MINER: You'll be a good
situation if you're able to

00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:29.480
have that many people interested
that you're

00:50:29.480 --> 00:50:30.170
narrowing it down.

00:50:30.170 --> 00:50:33.060
But the best thing to do is
ask them for some CEOs of

00:50:33.060 --> 00:50:34.610
other companies that
they've funded.

00:50:34.610 --> 00:50:38.840
Or try and find that yourself
as well and get those

00:50:38.840 --> 00:50:41.780
reference checks, just like
they'll do the same on you.

00:50:41.780 --> 00:50:43.650
KEVIN ROSE: You should also
check in with them and figure

00:50:43.650 --> 00:50:45.000
out how much of their
time you're actually

00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:45.850
going to get as well.

00:50:45.850 --> 00:50:48.840
I mean one of the things that,
when Digg finally had some

00:50:48.840 --> 00:50:51.530
traction and we were able to go
and kind of pick out who we

00:50:51.530 --> 00:50:56.880
wanted to work with from a VC
standpoint, I remember we took

00:50:56.880 --> 00:51:01.095
some money from Reid Hoffman and
actually and from David Z

00:51:01.095 --> 00:51:01.610
at Greylock.

00:51:01.610 --> 00:51:05.700
And David was more than willing
to come in almost

00:51:05.700 --> 00:51:07.783
every other week and sit down
with us and help us through

00:51:07.783 --> 00:51:10.860
some of our issues and have that
frank conversation, say,

00:51:10.860 --> 00:51:13.990
I like what you've built, your
portfolio is awesome.

00:51:13.990 --> 00:51:15.990
But when are we going to get
to meet and how often?

00:51:15.990 --> 00:51:18.280
And how can you help me?

00:51:18.280 --> 00:51:19.600
I think your point
of interviewing

00:51:19.600 --> 00:51:22.070
them is a great one.

00:51:22.070 --> 00:51:23.190
AUDIENCE: So are you nervous
about getting married.

00:51:23.190 --> 00:51:25.170
Is that why you're nervous now
with all this marriage talk?

00:51:25.170 --> 00:51:25.980
KEVIN ROSE: Yeah a little bit.

00:51:25.980 --> 00:51:28.120
That's not till next
year, though.

00:51:30.625 --> 00:51:33.640
AUDIENCE: I'm from Mexico, and
a couple of friends and me, I

00:51:33.640 --> 00:51:37.170
have a little start-up
there in Mexico City.

00:51:37.170 --> 00:51:40.910
My question is you talked about
the importance of being

00:51:40.910 --> 00:51:43.540
in the ecosystem,
being surrounded

00:51:43.540 --> 00:51:45.760
by all these start-ups.

00:51:45.760 --> 00:51:51.820
And our main market is in
Mexico, in Latin America.

00:51:51.820 --> 00:51:56.810
But I don't know if it would
be a nice idea to come here

00:51:56.810 --> 00:52:01.790
out to Silicon Valley to
mix with the ecosystem.

00:52:01.790 --> 00:52:06.460
And bring all these ideas,
and take it to our

00:52:06.460 --> 00:52:09.294
own start-up in Mexico.

00:52:09.294 --> 00:52:10.650
I don't know.

00:52:10.650 --> 00:52:13.610
KEVIN ROSE: I think one of the
things that needs to happen is

00:52:13.610 --> 00:52:16.470
there needs to be people like
you in other cities that go

00:52:16.470 --> 00:52:19.870
out and drive the start-up
culture for that city.

00:52:19.870 --> 00:52:22.330
I've seen people try to do
this in smaller cities.

00:52:22.330 --> 00:52:24.120
I have some friends that
live in Redding,

00:52:24.120 --> 00:52:25.560
California, little tiny city.

00:52:25.560 --> 00:52:27.570
And they go out and find a
person with the largest

00:52:27.570 --> 00:52:28.630
Twitter account.

00:52:28.630 --> 00:52:30.520
And they hunt that
person down.

00:52:30.520 --> 00:52:31.780
They get them to tweet out that
they're going to do a

00:52:31.780 --> 00:52:34.060
meet-up at a bar.

00:52:34.060 --> 00:52:36.170
I actually did this in Boulder,
Colorado, a few years

00:52:36.170 --> 00:52:39.420
ago when it was first starting
to explode over there.

00:52:39.420 --> 00:52:42.850
And we had 30, 40
people come out.

00:52:42.850 --> 00:52:43.910
And everyone got together.

00:52:43.910 --> 00:52:45.470
They were interested in
start-ups and we met up.

00:52:45.470 --> 00:52:48.920
And there wasn't that coffee
culture that you have here in

00:52:48.920 --> 00:52:49.370
San Francisco.

00:52:49.370 --> 00:52:51.400
So this was a way to get
everyone together at a certain

00:52:51.400 --> 00:52:53.870
point during the week, and we
talked about start-ups.

00:52:53.870 --> 00:52:55.210
And that's how we kicked
things off.

00:52:55.210 --> 00:52:58.420
And if you go out there today,
and you do the same tweet,

00:52:58.420 --> 00:53:00.220
it's going to be hundreds
of people.

00:53:00.220 --> 00:53:02.890
I think that you need to find
these other entrepreneurs, sit

00:53:02.890 --> 00:53:05.030
down with them, and
build a culture.

00:53:05.030 --> 00:53:06.820
It can be done anywhere.

00:53:06.820 --> 00:53:08.200
You just need to really
put in the time and

00:53:08.200 --> 00:53:09.730
effort to make it happen.

00:53:09.730 --> 00:53:12.810
AUDIENCE: Actually well in
Mexico City we have this

00:53:12.810 --> 00:53:17.450
little group of start-up
people.

00:53:17.450 --> 00:53:18.530
Here it's bigger.

00:53:18.530 --> 00:53:24.880
So maybe, I don't know if my
market is there, but I move

00:53:24.880 --> 00:53:28.910
here, I don't know, a
year or half a year.

00:53:28.910 --> 00:53:33.170
It would be like
counterproductive, because I'm

00:53:33.170 --> 00:53:34.570
away from my market.

00:53:34.570 --> 00:53:36.160
NAVAL RAVIKANT: It's good to
spend a little bit of time

00:53:36.160 --> 00:53:38.650
here, just because it'll force
you to up your game.

00:53:38.650 --> 00:53:40.205
You'll be playing with
the best athletes.

00:53:40.205 --> 00:53:43.360
It's like if you wanted to learn
how to make movies and

00:53:43.360 --> 00:53:44.550
you were making a movie,
you could do it

00:53:44.550 --> 00:53:45.270
anywhere in the world.

00:53:45.270 --> 00:53:46.880
But it would be great if you'd
spend a little bit of time in

00:53:46.880 --> 00:53:48.820
Hollywood to understand
how they make movies.

00:53:48.820 --> 00:53:51.000
Or if you want to do theater,
you spend a little bit of time

00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:52.330
in New York.

00:53:52.330 --> 00:53:54.330
So it's good to spend a little
bit of time and have some

00:53:54.330 --> 00:53:55.550
connections out here.

00:53:55.550 --> 00:53:57.690
But you don't need to be based
here all the time if

00:53:57.690 --> 00:53:58.880
everything you're building
is in Mexico.

00:53:58.880 --> 00:54:01.450
RICH MINER: I don't think any
of us would encourage you to

00:54:01.450 --> 00:54:03.630
transplant yourself from where
you're comfortable, where your

00:54:03.630 --> 00:54:06.460
market is, where your
connections are.

00:54:06.460 --> 00:54:08.770
And there's also nothing wrong
with being a big fish in a

00:54:08.770 --> 00:54:11.510
small pond if you really can
shout out and have a loud

00:54:11.510 --> 00:54:14.400
voice where you are.

00:54:14.400 --> 00:54:18.730
But I think the point is, try
and find some way of getting

00:54:18.730 --> 00:54:22.540
that magic that is the essence
of the valley or the

00:54:22.540 --> 00:54:24.150
entrepreneurial spirit
and bring it back

00:54:24.150 --> 00:54:25.250
to where you are.

00:54:25.250 --> 00:54:26.730
DON DODGE: We only have
five minutes left.

00:54:26.730 --> 00:54:28.940
We're moving into
lightning round.

00:54:28.940 --> 00:54:32.050
So lightning round is you ask
a question less than 30

00:54:32.050 --> 00:54:34.790
seconds, and we'll give you
a 30 second answer.

00:54:34.790 --> 00:54:37.460
AUDIENCE: So I hope this
resonates with other people.

00:54:37.460 --> 00:54:39.020
And I like the reference
to athletes.

00:54:39.020 --> 00:54:43.660
So think of like, I could go for
a year right now with my

00:54:43.660 --> 00:54:44.970
own personal finances.

00:54:44.970 --> 00:54:46.380
I think I'm at the
top of my game.

00:54:46.380 --> 00:54:48.330
I've built a service-based
company.

00:54:48.330 --> 00:54:50.660
I'm not convinced that
any of my own ideas

00:54:50.660 --> 00:54:53.270
are the one to do.

00:54:53.270 --> 00:54:57.060
Wondering, any suggestions
on--

00:54:57.060 --> 00:54:59.500
I don't want to chase the money,
I don't want to talk to

00:54:59.500 --> 00:55:03.240
VCs or angels because I
don't have that idea.

00:55:03.240 --> 00:55:07.980
What I do want is I want to work
with other individuals

00:55:07.980 --> 00:55:15.570
who need to build something and
need technical expertise.

00:55:15.570 --> 00:55:17.180
Yeah how do you do that?

00:55:17.180 --> 00:55:17.420
NAVAL RAVIKANT: You're like the
rarest, most valuable man

00:55:17.420 --> 00:55:18.890
in the valley.

00:55:18.890 --> 00:55:21.400
KEVIN ROSE: Run, because you'll
be chased out of here.

00:55:21.400 --> 00:55:24.140
NAVAL RAVIKANT: Go join some
great start-up early on whose

00:55:24.140 --> 00:55:26.370
mission you can get behind, and
they'll give you a lot of

00:55:26.370 --> 00:55:27.870
equity and a lot of
responsibility.

00:55:27.870 --> 00:55:30.170
And you'll learn how to do a
start-up and maybe you'll come

00:55:30.170 --> 00:55:32.395
along with your own thing
eventually and want to leave

00:55:32.395 --> 00:55:33.210
and go do that.

00:55:33.210 --> 00:55:35.130
But in the meantime you'll build
a great alumni network,

00:55:35.130 --> 00:55:35.970
you'll learn on their dime.

00:55:35.970 --> 00:55:38.050
And you won't have--

00:55:38.050 --> 00:55:41.290
being an entrepreneur exposes
you to the ultimate level of

00:55:41.290 --> 00:55:45.140
stress, because you're the
last line of defense.

00:55:45.140 --> 00:55:48.190
And so you don't want to be in
that mental stress situation

00:55:48.190 --> 00:55:49.290
unless you have to.

00:55:49.290 --> 00:55:52.230
So you're in a position where
you can go join a start-up

00:55:52.230 --> 00:55:54.490
that's small but working on
something important with good

00:55:54.490 --> 00:55:55.860
people and still get
a lot of equity.

00:55:55.860 --> 00:55:57.860
And people like you are
gold right now.

00:55:57.860 --> 00:55:59.590
AUDIENCE: And where
do you find those?

00:55:59.590 --> 00:56:01.720
NAVAL RAVIKANT: Angel List
talent, Angel [INAUDIBLE].

00:56:01.720 --> 00:56:03.610
A thousand start-ups recruiting
like their first

00:56:03.610 --> 00:56:05.500
engineer, their first
non-founding

00:56:05.500 --> 00:56:07.820
engineer, or even founders.

00:56:07.820 --> 00:56:09.070
AUDIENCE: At the founder
level, not engineers.

00:56:09.070 --> 00:56:09.430
NAVAL RAVIKANT: That's fine.

00:56:09.430 --> 00:56:10.950
They're recruiting
founders too.

00:56:10.950 --> 00:56:12.210
RICH MINER: You can
also talk to VCs.

00:56:12.210 --> 00:56:14.960
Basically to this point VCs
would love to find you.

00:56:14.960 --> 00:56:17.220
If they think there's a match
with one of their portfolio

00:56:17.220 --> 00:56:18.470
companies, they'll
connect you up.

00:56:21.080 --> 00:56:23.900
AUDIENCE: Can you guys talk
about how you hear countless

00:56:23.900 --> 00:56:25.490
ideas and you turn them
away or whatever.

00:56:25.490 --> 00:56:26.930
They don't appeal to you.

00:56:26.930 --> 00:56:30.210
As an entrepreneur, if you catch
the eye of an investor,

00:56:30.210 --> 00:56:32.950
but you don't get a good vibe
from them, maybe you feel that

00:56:32.950 --> 00:56:35.553
they're going to hinder on your
project or whatever it is

00:56:35.553 --> 00:56:38.620
that you're working on, have you
ever had a situation where

00:56:38.620 --> 00:56:41.120
you're denied, like somebody
doesn't want to work with you?

00:56:41.120 --> 00:56:46.460
And as an entrepreneur, would
you ever encourage somebody to

00:56:46.460 --> 00:56:50.360
decline money from a VC if you
felt that they just weren't on

00:56:50.360 --> 00:56:53.220
the same wavelength as you?

00:56:53.220 --> 00:56:53.940
NAVAL RAVIKANT: I think
you answered your own

00:56:53.940 --> 00:56:54.950
question but yes.

00:56:54.950 --> 00:56:58.720
DON DODGE: Yes, I've advised
entrepreneurs to turn down

00:56:58.720 --> 00:57:02.270
money from investors that were
not going to be helpful.

00:57:02.270 --> 00:57:03.390
They were sharks.

00:57:03.390 --> 00:57:04.640
So don't do it.

00:57:06.960 --> 00:57:10.180
AUDIENCE: So if you have a group
of guys that are just

00:57:10.180 --> 00:57:12.800
kind of putting something
together, what does that look

00:57:12.800 --> 00:57:16.910
like, the kind of going from
just a group of guys to OK,

00:57:16.910 --> 00:57:18.100
now we have seed money.

00:57:18.100 --> 00:57:21.760
And you're ready to go as far
as equity goes and all that

00:57:21.760 --> 00:57:22.460
kind of stuff.

00:57:22.460 --> 00:57:26.460
I mean do you work that out
before you talk to the guys,

00:57:26.460 --> 00:57:29.870
the money, and then just kind of
figure that out beforehand?

00:57:32.510 --> 00:57:33.770
NAVAL RAVIKANT: Yeah,
beforehand.

00:57:33.770 --> 00:57:35.560
A lot of good writing's
on it online.

00:57:35.560 --> 00:57:39.150
Generally even splits work
better but not always.

00:57:39.150 --> 00:57:42.370
AUDIENCE: And then as far as
just getting other people that

00:57:42.370 --> 00:57:47.120
aren't part of that core team to
do work, paying them out of

00:57:47.120 --> 00:57:50.550
funds internally and stuff
like that, does that--

00:57:50.550 --> 00:57:54.130
it always comes up, the split.

00:57:54.130 --> 00:57:57.340
The split of the company always
seems like something

00:57:57.340 --> 00:57:59.610
that people stumble over.

00:57:59.610 --> 00:58:01.220
KEVIN ROSE: I've always believed
that if it's your

00:58:01.220 --> 00:58:03.690
idea, and you're the one
bringing the idea to the

00:58:03.690 --> 00:58:07.310
table, no one else helped
contribute to that idea, you

00:58:07.310 --> 00:58:09.680
should have obviously the
bulk of the company.

00:58:09.680 --> 00:58:12.320
And then figure out who you're
going to hire, and then give

00:58:12.320 --> 00:58:14.380
them percentages based on the
fact that you're hiring that

00:58:14.380 --> 00:58:17.180
individual and they're not
really a co-founder with you.

00:58:17.180 --> 00:58:19.310
If you're partnering up with
someone that is collaborating

00:58:19.310 --> 00:58:21.590
with you and actually
contributing to the idea,

00:58:21.590 --> 00:58:22.840
that's a different case.

00:58:28.740 --> 00:58:31.060
AUDIENCE: Coming from as a
computer science background,

00:58:31.060 --> 00:58:33.460
do you have any quick
suggestions for figuring out

00:58:33.460 --> 00:58:35.390
the business side of things
without having like a trial by

00:58:35.390 --> 00:58:39.280
fire or getting an MBA at
a really early stage?

00:58:39.280 --> 00:58:40.990
DON DODGE: Get a business
co-founder.

00:58:40.990 --> 00:58:42.720
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:58:42.720 --> 00:58:43.790
NAVAL RAVIKANT: I wouldn't
even look for business.

00:58:43.790 --> 00:58:45.040
I'd look for someone
who can sell.

00:58:48.370 --> 00:58:51.990
AUDIENCE: Perfect intro, how do
I find a co-founder if I'm

00:58:51.990 --> 00:58:53.240
not a people person?

00:58:55.640 --> 00:58:59.280
DON DODGE: Build and
they will find you.

00:58:59.280 --> 00:58:59.980
NAVAL RAVIKANT: Go
to a meet-up and

00:58:59.980 --> 00:59:03.740
have a drink, or two.

00:59:03.740 --> 00:59:05.770
AUDIENCE: I have a question
about, there's a bunch of

00:59:05.770 --> 00:59:07.430
companies popping up
to do development

00:59:07.430 --> 00:59:08.580
services for equity.

00:59:08.580 --> 00:59:11.870
I have a company that focuses on
building MEBs for start-up

00:59:11.870 --> 00:59:15.050
for a mixture of cash and equity
and I'm curious to hear

00:59:15.050 --> 00:59:18.280
how does an investor view a
company in the seed stage or

00:59:18.280 --> 00:59:20.330
beyond whose product
was built by an

00:59:20.330 --> 00:59:21.580
outsourced team basically.

00:59:23.920 --> 00:59:25.760
RICH MINER: I discount
it a little bit.

00:59:25.760 --> 00:59:26.480
I mean it depends.

00:59:26.480 --> 00:59:28.623
If it was just to get somebody
running, but they know who

00:59:28.623 --> 00:59:30.130
they're going to hire is going
to be able to build the

00:59:30.130 --> 00:59:32.840
product, but if I don't see
the technical expertise to

00:59:32.840 --> 00:59:35.150
take that or do it in-house or
understand it, then it's a big

00:59:35.150 --> 00:59:36.720
discount for me.

00:59:36.720 --> 00:59:37.960
NAVAL RAVIKANT: For me
it's a fatal signal.

00:59:37.960 --> 00:59:39.885
I wouldn't invest in a company
that outsources core tech

00:59:39.885 --> 00:59:41.135
development.

00:59:43.440 --> 00:59:45.550
AUDIENCE: So if you're trying to
raise money for a consumer

00:59:45.550 --> 00:59:49.080
play, but there's also a B2B
aspect of it that could make

00:59:49.080 --> 00:59:52.370
money, do you look down on
something that has a revenue

00:59:52.370 --> 00:59:55.930
stream that's not part of the
core long-term vision, like do

00:59:55.930 --> 00:59:57.640
you start looking at the
valuation in terms of the

00:59:57.640 --> 01:00:00.845
revenue, or is it you see
the larger consumer

01:00:00.845 --> 01:00:02.690
play part of it?

01:00:02.690 --> 01:00:06.930
Would you rather see not
generate any revenue and just

01:00:06.930 --> 01:00:10.720
focus on consumer, or is it OK
to have that little revenue?

01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:11.740
NAVAL RAVIKANT: You
can do either one.

01:00:11.740 --> 01:00:13.870
Just do one thing.

01:00:13.870 --> 01:00:17.350
DON DODGE: OK, we're at
the end of our show.

01:00:17.350 --> 01:00:20.250
We have to stop unfortunately.

01:00:20.250 --> 01:00:23.450
So please join me in thanking
our panel for

01:00:23.450 --> 01:00:24.700
answering your questions.
