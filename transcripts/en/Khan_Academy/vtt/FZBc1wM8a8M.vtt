00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.030
- [Instructor] In this video,

00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:03.750
we're going to give an overview
of the types of markets

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.110
that you might encounter
in an economics class.

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:07.640
And we're going to get
a little bit precise

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:09.850
with our language 'cause you'll hear words

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:12.720
like perfect competition or monopoly

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.070
or oligopoly a lot in economics

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:17.210
and frankly, even in your broader life.

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:19.470
Now before we even go into those terms,

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.850
I will differentiate
between what's sometimes

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:25.790
referred to as a product market.

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:29.930
And other markets that are
referred to as resource.

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:32.690
Resource markets.

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:34.920
Now product market is a market

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.393
where the output of that market,

00:00:36.393 --> 00:00:39.460
what the market is producing
or what it's buying and selling

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.600
it is something that people will consume

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.280
and it doesn't just have
to be physical product

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.730
it could also be some type of a service.

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:47.910
So examples of product markets,

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.283
it could be the market for shirts,

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.170
it could be cars or it
could even be a service.

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.850
It could be tax preparation,
tax preparation.

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:02.690
These would all be product markets

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.810
because it's something
that people would consume.

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:07.790
I would call this
consumer tax preparation,

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:09.410
not business tax preparations.

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:11.560
So this is consumer tax preparation.

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:12.930
Now based on my clarification,

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.810
you might guess what a
resource market is all about.

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.200
These are markets for the
inputs into other products.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.370
Or into the production
of other even resources.

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:26.010
So, these would be your famous

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:28.830
inputs of or factors of production.

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.260
It could be, for example,
the market of labor.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.170
It could be something like farm land.

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.030
Where farm land is used
to produce something else.

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.000
It could be the market for capital goods.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.960
Maybe robots for factories.

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.740
But either way, whether we're
talking about product markets

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.270
or resource markets, we can
think about them in broad terms

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.170
based on how many players
there are in the market

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.940
and how differentiated the
players are in the market

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:02.420
and how much control
they have over the price

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.540
and how are the barriers to entry.

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:08.783
Let's set up a spectrum here
to explore that a little bit.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.110
So I will set up a spectrum.

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.490
Now the extreme end of the
spectrum right over here,

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:17.430
when you only have one player,

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.050
one player in the market.

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:24.970
In the market, or actually
let me just say one firm.

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.830
Because player's not really
clear on what I'm talking about

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:29.170
whether I'm talking
about a buyer or seller.

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.080
One firm in market.

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.330
And let's say, many buyers.

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.960
Many buyers.

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:40.650
You are probably familiar
with what we call this market

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.350
or what we would call this firm.

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.390
It has a monopoly!

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.257
It has a monopoly name for a famous game

00:02:47.257 --> 00:02:49.220
because the whole point of that game

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.200
is to try to be that last firm standing.

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.990
The firm that owns all of the real estate.

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:59.550
Now what are the situations
that would describe a monopoly?

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:02.520
Well, a monopoly is a situation
where you have very high,

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.890
one could argue insurmountable
barriers to entry,

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:06.450
so very high.

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.270
High barriers,

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:12.313
barriers to entry.

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:15.930
And monopolies can
sometimes be controversial

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.300
but they're not necessarily illegal.

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.320
In fact, in many countries, a monopoly

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.300
can be granted to a
firm through things like

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:26.450
the intellectual property
or through patents,

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:29.180
for example a drug company
if it discovers a cure

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.770
for a drug or something
to maintain a drug,

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:35.580
well they might be granted
a monopoly for that pill

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:38.600
for some period of time and
the government does that

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.580
so that they can recoup
their investment in all of

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:44.150
the R&amp;D that they actually produced.

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.750
What often is illegal
in a lot of countries,

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.200
is if firm misuses its monopoly power.

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.920
But anyway, now let's
go to the other extreme.

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.910
Let's imagine a situation where instead of

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:57.780
high barriers to entry,
there is no barriers.

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.830
No barriers

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.607
to entry.

00:04:03.607 --> 00:04:07.923
Now let's say that there
is no differentiation.

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:11.920
And you have many players.

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.950
So many, or let me write many firms.

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:16.720
I keep wanting to say players,

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:18.040
but that doesn't make it that clear.

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:21.720
And actually let me say
many firms and many buyers.

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.090
And many buyers.

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:25.130
Now this is a state that we'll often study

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:28.490
in our economics class, we'll
call it perfect competition.

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:29.323
Perfect

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:31.353
competition.

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.480
In a perfect competition world,

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:37.590
the firms are essentially
have to be price takers.

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:39.430
They take whatever the market price is

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:42.800
and we have used that assumption
in a lot of situations.

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.490
In a monopoly, on the other side,

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:46.070
they could be the price setters.

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:48.880
They're the only player in that market.

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:51.480
Now, in general when anything
is described as perfect

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:54.920
it's usually theoretical and
so is perfect competition.

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:56.800
There's no markets that I can think of

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.330
that are perfectly perfect,

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.500
but I can think of ones that are close.

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:02.990
For say, some agricultural commodities.

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:05.010
So say the sugar market.

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:07.440
So the market for sugar might be

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.760
pretty close to perfect competition.

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:11.290
There could be many firms, those

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:13.910
would be the farmers, the suppliers.

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:16.820
It would be many buyers
obviously who want sugar.

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:18.790
There would be some barriers to entry.

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:20.350
You'd need to know how to grow sugar,

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:23.310
you would need suitable
land for growing sugar.

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:25.720
But there's a lot of
farmers who might be able

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:27.970
to swap out either sugar cane or beet,

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:30.390
which is where most sugar comes from.

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:32.380
With soy bean or vice versa.

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:35.510
So they can change which crops they plant

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:37.920
and generally speaking, there's
not much differentiation

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:40.250
whether you get sugar
from one farm or another.

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:42.447
So sugar would be pretty
close to perfect competition

00:05:42.447 --> 00:05:45.890
and it is the case for a lot
of agricultural commodities

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:48.270
that they do have to be price takers.

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:51.080
There is just a market price
that the individual farmer

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:52.940
is gonna say, oh actually I
wanna charge a little bit more

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:54.940
for that sugar because
they won't be able to.

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:56.060
They're just going to have to take

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:58.160
whatever the price is in the market.

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.370
Now as you can imagine,
there is a lot of other

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:04.180
types of markets that are
in between these extremes.

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:07.090
Closer to a monopoly and
similar to a monopoly

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:09.340
in a lot of ways is a
situation where you have

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:13.033
only a handful of firms and
that's referred to oligopoly.

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:18.160
And this is a situation where
you still have high barriers.

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:23.160
So high barriers to entry.

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:25.970
You might have a handful of firms,

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:30.970
so a few firms and you
still have many buyers.

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:35.000
Examples of oligopolies, this could be

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.890
things like the aircraft industry.

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:39.920
Air craft.

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:41.557
Where there's huge barriers of entry.

00:06:41.557 --> 00:06:44.800
You need to deploy a lot of
capital billions of dollars.

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:46.890
You might have to get government approval

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:49.590
and so that's why,
especially for large aircraft

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:52.170
you only have a few
firms that can produce,

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:55.280
like Boeing or Airbus,
those really large aircraft.

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:57.920
Even in certain cases, automobiles,

00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:59.370
sometimes computer manufacturers,

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:03.422
things that have very
high barriers to entry.

00:07:03.422 --> 00:07:06.310
If we go a little bit
further to the left, you get

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:10.740
a situation that's known as
monopolistic competition.

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:14.823
Monopolistic, that's
fun to say, competition.

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:19.050
And this you could view
as right in between,

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:20.840
depending on what you're thinking about.

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:23.870
This is a situation where
there's low barriers to entry,

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:24.820
low

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:28.280
low barriers to entry.

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:30.110
There's many firms.

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:31.453
Many firms.

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:34.680
But you do have differentiation.

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:38.120
You do have differentiation
so you can tell

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:40.170
the product of one firm for another.

00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:43.100
And I can think of many,
in fact most industries

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:46.530
I can think of fall roughly
in the monopolistic area.

00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:50.110
Although we've just mention
some oligopolies and monopolies.

00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:52.330
But examples of monopolistic competition,

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:55.640
I can imagine to be things like,

00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:59.140
cereal, breakfast cereals
and the breakfast cereal

00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:02.440
industry, there is many firms.

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:04.442
There's generally low barriers.

00:08:04.442 --> 00:08:06.610
There's some barriers
but they're pretty low

00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:07.850
if you want to start a cereal company

00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:09.910
a lot of folks might be able to do it.

00:08:09.910 --> 00:08:12.309
But there is some differentiation.

00:08:12.309 --> 00:08:14.950
Some people say hey our
cereal is more delicious

00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:15.970
and it's sweeter while others say

00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:18.840
our cereal is more nutritious
and they build a brand

00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:20.490
and they do marketing, etc, etc.

00:08:20.490 --> 00:08:23.090
And because there is some differentiation,

00:08:23.090 --> 00:08:27.230
there's a little bit more ability
for the individual players

00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:29.670
unlike in perfect competition
there's a little bit

00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:32.200
more ability for them
to dictate their price.

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:34.130
They might say, hey
we're a premium product,

00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:35.530
people think we're healthier so we might

00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:37.740
be able to charge a little bit more.

00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:40.050
You can almost imagine that
they have their own unique

00:08:40.050 --> 00:08:43.800
demand curve because of
that differentiation.

00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:47.900
You can imagine the market in
something like, well shirts.

00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:49.173
That's another example.

00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:52.160
Where a lot of folks can produce shirts,

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:54.390
but some people might be able
to differentiate themselves.

00:08:54.390 --> 00:08:56.140
They're more stylish,
there's better quality,

00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:57.800
they advertise, they build a brand.

00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:01.830
And so once again, that would
be monopolistic competition.

00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:03.540
So anyway, the big picture here

00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:06.140
is really just for you to get
familiar with these words.

00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:07.280
What do they mean?

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:10.520
And then what context or
what will they imply about

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:12.690
the differentiation or
the number of firms?

00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:14.690
And actually before I leave,
I'll throw out one other word

00:09:14.690 --> 00:09:15.810
that you'll hear a little bit less

00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:18.110
than what I just talked
about and it sounds

00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:21.400
like monopoly but it is monopsony.

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:24.060
And I'm gonna do this
in a unique color here.

00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:27.430
Let me see, I haven't done
anything in this salmon yet.

00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:28.303
Monopsony.

00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:31.690
Which you won't hear
it as much as monopoly.

00:09:31.690 --> 00:09:33.600
And it's really the opposite situation.

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:36.890
Instead of one supplier and many buyers,

00:09:36.890 --> 00:09:41.770
a monopsony is one big
buyer and many suppliers.

00:09:41.770 --> 00:09:44.730
So for example, if you
have one big box store

00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:47.160
in a small town, and so they're

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:49.440
the only employer in that town

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:52.720
they might have monopsony
in the labor market,

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:54.640
where they're the only people who can hire

00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:57.340
and there's a lot of people
who are looking for jobs.

00:09:57.340 --> 00:09:59.740
But we can talk more about
that in other videos.
