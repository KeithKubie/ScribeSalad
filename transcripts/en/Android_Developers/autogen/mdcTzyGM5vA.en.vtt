 Sharon Richter: I and my partner, Guy Oranim, 

00:00:08.466 --> 00:00:11.166
 Management of BabyFirst company from the idea of ​​being excited about it 

00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:13.066
 Creating good educational content 

00:00:13.066 --> 00:00:15.633
 For infants, young children and their parents. 

00:00:15.633 --> 00:00:19.300
 Today, BabyFirst apps have been downloaded more than 30 million times. 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.333
 When we met the family class 

00:00:21.333 --> 00:00:22.666
 In the Google Play store 

00:00:22.666 --> 00:00:26.200
 We found that this exactly matches BabyFirst values 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.266
 As any BabyFirst application will always provide value for families 

00:00:29.266 --> 00:00:31.666
 In a way that allows the child and father / mother to interact 

00:00:31.666 --> 00:00:34.066
 With age-appropriate content always available. 

00:00:34.066 --> 00:00:36.466
 We noticed that parents can easily find 

00:00:36.466 --> 00:00:38.600
 Content they're looking for. 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.333
 Now our app downloads have increased by 40% through GOOGLE PLAY 

00:00:42.333 --> 00:00:44.266
 As compared to what we do on other platforms. 

00:00:44.266 --> 00:00:46.100
 That impressed us. 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.933
 Yuval Richter: Allow us to test our store data card 

00:00:47.933 --> 00:00:49.933
 To know exactly what works in the store 

00:00:49.933 --> 00:00:52.100
 As well as attractive code and interesting video 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.733
 In addition to the expressive screenshot. 

00:00:53.733 --> 00:00:55.733
 For the first time, we can test it all really 

00:00:55.733 --> 00:00:57.500
 With actual Android users 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.200
 Just to identify the successful elements by almost 100%. 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.366
 That is what matters to us. 

00:01:02.366 --> 00:01:03.666
 You can use drag-and-drop. 

00:01:03.666 --> 00:01:05.366
 You can customize a certain amount of data traffic 

00:01:05.366 --> 00:01:06.533
 For the new experience. 

00:01:06.533 --> 00:01:09.433
 So the risks are low and the gains are high. 

00:01:09.433 --> 00:01:11.933
 In the application "ABC" for example, when we tested the symbols 

00:01:11.933 --> 00:01:14.733
 Try using a bold or light colored icon when compared to the surrounding area. 

00:01:14.733 --> 00:01:16.566
 We also tried different colors in the same code. 

00:01:16.566 --> 00:01:19.133
 We tried using two or three dimensions 

00:01:19.133 --> 00:01:20.933
 In the end, we know what the user really likes 

00:01:20.933 --> 00:01:23.766
 As well as what attracts the attention of users. 

00:01:23.766 --> 00:01:26.166
 After testing the application of "ABC" 

00:01:26.166 --> 00:01:28.966
 We noticed a 140% increase in downloads. 

00:01:28.966 --> 00:01:31.100
 That was great. 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.833

00:01:33.833 --> 00:01:37.466
 In the "Play Phone" app, we tested screenshots. 

00:01:37.466 --> 00:01:40.233
 We inserted a phone image into the same screenshot. 

00:01:40.233 --> 00:01:43.100
 We've tweaked the text, colors, and shapes. 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.133
 This has resulted in an 11% increase in search downloads. 

00:01:47.133 --> 00:01:49.166
 [Funny Music] 

00:01:49.166 --> 00:01:50.600
 We did something else simple 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.866
 The translation of the store listing page into 10 languages. 

00:01:53.866 --> 00:01:57.233
 This led to a 150% increase in search downloads 

00:01:57.233 --> 00:01:58.833
 From outside the United States. 

00:01:58.833 --> 00:02:01.233
 And by combining the experiences of the store 

00:02:01.233 --> 00:02:03.500
 Family and translation 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.533
 We can achieve a 50% increase in downloads 

00:02:06.533 --> 00:02:08.166
 Through the applications we create. 

00:02:08.166 --> 00:02:10.666
 Sharon: I think we are very lucky. 

00:02:10.666 --> 00:02:13.366
 We work in the area we love. 

00:02:13.366 --> 00:02:15.833
 And make children happy day by day. 

00:02:15.833 --> 00:02:19.300
 Now we plan to create better children's apps 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:20.600
 With also talking to their mothers 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.300
 Because we are now confident 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.333
 We want to make life easier for mothers. 

00:02:25.333 --> 00:02:26.866
 We are very excited about the future 

00:02:26.866 --> 00:02:28.166
 Because the prototype is a success 

00:02:28.166 --> 00:02:30.133
 We are excited to invest that heavily. 

00:02:30.133 --> 00:02:36.133
