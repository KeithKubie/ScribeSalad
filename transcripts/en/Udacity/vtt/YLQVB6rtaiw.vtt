00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.105
Congratulations. You just mastered the second challenge of

00:00:03.105 --> 00:00:06.300
finding out where the robot is, with measurement noise.

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:09.480
Now, we're going to turn the attention to motion,

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.135
to control. Your mission, should you choose to accept

00:00:13.135 --> 00:00:17.600
this, is to capture the robot. And to make it a little bit easier, we made you

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.580
twice as fast, and took away the measurement problem

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.940
so you can seize the state again. Good luck.
