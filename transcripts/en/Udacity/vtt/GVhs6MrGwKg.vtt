00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.610
Here's a typical best practice for
using ListView.

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:07.190
You feed it with some sort of
an adapter, like a CursorAdapter,

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:12.298
which you feed with a CursorLoader and
you register an OnItemClickListener

00:00:12.298 --> 00:00:15.770
with the ListView to get notified
when the list item is clicked.

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:19.590
And, you might have used a ViewHolder
pattern to help you populate views with

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:20.750
that CursorAdapter.

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:26.350
Well, using RecyclerView, we see some
familiar faces, like CursorLoader.

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:29.700
Where ViewHolder was an optional but
recommended part of the ListView

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:34.045
pattern, it's a required and integral
part of the RecyclerView pattern.

00:00:34.045 --> 00:00:38.400
Now we don't have a CursorAdapter at the
moment, and that's not such a terrible

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.490
thing, because now that we have
CursorLoader doing the work of reloading

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:46.250
our cursors when content changes,
CursorAdapter didn't do all that much.

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.210
We also don't have
an OnItemClickListener.

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:53.350
Now, one could use the
OnItemTouchListener along with a gesture

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:58.100
detector to determine when an item is
clicked, but it's more common to just

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.140
have your view holder implement
an OnItemClickListener for

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.361
the individual views that it's holding.

00:01:04.361 --> 00:01:08.250
The ViewHolder has access to the Adapter
position that has been clicked.

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.070
And since it is typically
an inner class ViewAdapter,

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.470
it would also have access to
the adapter data for click handling.

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.040
Let's show how this works in practice.

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.740
In onCreateViewHolder from our adapter,
we inflate the appropriate layout for

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:22.900
the view type.

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.680
Note that our sample ViewHolder can
change references to the views.

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.750
Just like we would have done in
the old school ViewHolder pattern.

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.430
In on create ViewHolder from our
adapter, when we create the ViewHolder,

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.410
we have to pass the root
view into the superclass.

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:40.410
We then can start references to
the child views we want to fill out

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:41.720
if we wish.

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.570
This is also a good place to
set the OnClickListener for

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.530
the view, note that we have to have our
viewHolder implement the OnClickListener

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:49.780
to use this pattern in this way.

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.351
And when we bind the ViewHolder, we
take advantage of our ViewHolder being

00:01:54.351 --> 00:01:58.540
a non-static interclass for Adaptor,
so it has access to our data.

00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:59.620
In this case, a cursor.
