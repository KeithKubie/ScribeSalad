JONAH JONES: Hey everyone.

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:05.200
Thanks for coming.

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.800
Today we're going to talk about
the process of redesigning

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.840
Google Maps.

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.160
My name's Jonah.

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.370
I've been working as a designer
at Google for seven years now.

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:16.789
ANNETTE LEONG: Hello everyone.

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:17.580
My name is Annette.

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.590
I'm also a designer
on Google Maps.

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.300
I've been at Google
for 2 and 1/2 years.

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.140
In the new Maps I designed
the overall framework

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.220
and image browsing experience.

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:30.240
JONAH JONES: And I led
the overall redesign.

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.350
So Google Maps was
launched back in 2005.

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.020
And this time last year, we
announced the new Google Maps.

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:41.740
And this was the biggest
redesign we'd ever done.

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:44.860
Over the last year we've
made a ton of changes.

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:46.700
We had a long preview period.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.780
And now this is the new
default experience for Maps.

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.380
So there are some pretty major
changes that have taken place.

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:56.910
The map is now dynamic
and full screen

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.750
and it adapts to every
single one of your clicks.

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:05.269
And the imagery is also
fully immersive in 3D.

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:07.860
But as you can imagine,
redesigning a product used

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.630
by a billion people is
quite a daunting task.

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:12.590
And we wanted to share
a little bit of insight

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.040
into what our process was,
so that you can design

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.220
your apps to be ready for
a billion users as well.

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.555
And we thought about
what this entailed.

00:01:21.555 --> 00:01:22.970
And we realized
that it basically

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.070
boils down to three key lessons.

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.220
The first is to think big.

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.080
So that you don't get
trapped incrementalism.

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.850
The second is to
question everything,

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.730
because sometimes
your assumptions

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:38.640
can be holding you back.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.140
And the third lesson is
to listen to your users,

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.510
because even if you think
big and question everything,

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:46.900
you're not going to be
right about everything.

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:51.350
So let's jump into the first
lesson, which is to think big.

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.410
We started with
an audacious goal,

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:56.250
which is that we wanted
to redefine expectations

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.000
of online maps.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.310
And if you look at what we
had with the previous maps,

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.890
we'd added so many
features over the years

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.750
that the old user
interface was starting

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.520
to get really, really cluttered.

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.229
And every new
feature we added was

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:10.970
making it harder to
find that new feature

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.900
and the old features too.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.870
We'd added thousands
of businesses.

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.120
We'd added thousands of
miles of Street View.

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.750
And we'd also added
further ways of transport,

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.500
so it's not just about driving.

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.412
It can be about walking
or public transit.

00:02:25.412 --> 00:02:28.410
On a technology
side as well, Ajax

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.070
was the big innovation
back in 2005

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:35.100
that let people smoothly
scroll and zoom the map.

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.830
But nowadays, there are
more recent technologies

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.610
like HTML5 and WebGL that
let people do vector graphics

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.210
directly within a web browser.

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:47.220
And consumer expectations
had changed too.

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.320
The arrival of mobile
had brought new paradigms

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:55.120
for touch-based user interfaces.

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.270
But even more
fundamentally than that,

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:00.000
we felt the existing mapping
products were basically

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.110
just taking this old
scanned map and sprinkling

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:06.000
a few pins on top and adding
a search box at the top.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.970
And we thought surely
we can do better

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:11.360
with dynamic digital maps.

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.980
So we went back to
the drawing board.

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.520
And we thought how would Maps
be if we reinvented it today,

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.979
using all of the great data
that we have as a foundation

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:23.270
and everything that we've
learned over those last seven

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:24.610
years.

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:26.910
And we came up with
this vision that we

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:28.880
called "The Future of Maps."

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.370
And we created this
short video that we

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:32.540
shipped around the company.

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.900
And this was really,
really good to get people

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:37.780
on the same page about
where our vision was,

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.113
and where we were headed, and
where our big thinking was

00:03:40.113 --> 00:03:41.110
going.

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:42.944
And actually it's
quite interesting.

00:03:42.944 --> 00:03:45.110
Looking at this video,
there's a lot of the concepts

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:47.630
that we had there made it
through into the final product.

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:49.700
So here you see we have
a beautiful new set

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.510
of rich dynamic
bright map tiles.

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:54.590
And this is Lausanne
in Switzerland.

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:57.520
And what happens now is we
click on a transit station.

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:58.750
And suddenly the map shifts.

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.750
And dynamically becomes all
about the transit network.

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:04.170
Later in the video
we do a search.

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:05.980
And now we can see
that the search results

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:08.160
are the primary focused thing.

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:09.730
And they're labeled too.

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:13.780
And then toward the end of
the video, we zoom in further.

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:16.510
And amongst all of the
regular points of interest,

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:19.327
we see the places that I've
been to, and I've rated.

00:04:19.327 --> 00:04:21.910
And the places that my friends
have been to and rated as well.

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:23.440
So this is a map built for you.

00:04:25.884 --> 00:04:26.550
Over to Annette.

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:32.310
ANNETTE LEONG: While the concept
video focused on the map tiles,

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:35.240
it was a challenge to come
up with a framework that

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.110
could really support and
highlight the maps itself.

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:42.650
And yet be fully
functional and easy to use.

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:44.080
We wanted to think big.

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.920
We wanted to be able to
explore quickly and capture

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:48.800
all possibilities.

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.080
And wireframes and sketches
were great for that.

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.790
We made hundreds of
wireframes and sketches

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:57.630
to generate ideas
and to [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:59.690
and also lay out variations.

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:02.660
This method let us go broad.

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:06.200
Then, from a subset of these
wireframes and sketches,

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:07.280
we went steep.

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:10.540
We started filling in with
the right typography, colors,

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:14.510
and visual elements to
create higher fidelity marks.

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:16.260
The look and feel of
the product started

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.810
to really come together.

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:21.340
As we generated more
and more of these marks,

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:25.200
it can be hard to keep track
of what's the latest version.

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.850
It's like an engineer
constantly asked you

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:30.030
where can I find
the latest file?

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:33.320
So we needed a better
way to organize them.

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:35.560
As you may know,
when engineers want

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:37.770
to show progress of
their latest code,

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:42.500
they create a build to test how
well the code in the biggest

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:44.180
system.

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:47.650
So we did the same for design.

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:51.480
We created a design build,
where we put in all the latest

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:55.680
designs from individual
designers into a single place.

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:58.240
To keep things simple
and easy to digest,

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:01.050
we focused on a
few key scenarios.

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:05.360
Like finding a restaurant,
getting directions,

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.920
and browsing imagery.

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:12.040
This let the designers,
PMs, engineers, and everyone

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:17.270
in the company to see
where we were headed.

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:19.690
JONAH JONES: So it's really
important to think big.

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:21.090
But if you want
to think big, you

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:24.290
have to be willing to
question everything.

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:27.400
So you could argue if it
ain't broke, don't fix it.

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:28.884
This seems fairly reasonable.

00:06:28.884 --> 00:06:30.300
But it turns out
this isn't really

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:31.760
the case with technology.

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:34.130
As you saw before, adding
more and more features

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:35.930
meant that we couldn't
stay still anymore.

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:37.580
But also the world is changing.

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:41.160
So by staying still, you're
basically moving backward.

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:43.230
So I want to give you
a couple of examples

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:46.830
of where we were questioning
things as we were redesigning

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:48.230
different parts of the system.

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:50.271
And the first is around
the map tiles themselves.

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:55.160
So this is how the map
tiles used to look,

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:57.150
when you were looking
at a world view.

00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:58.700
And you can see
here that we've got

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:01.330
some countries and some
states and obviously the land

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:02.460
masses and stuff.

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:04.715
But we realized
that actually this

00:07:04.715 --> 00:07:06.090
isn't answering
all the questions

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:07.450
that our users might have.

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:10.312
Like why are people going
to a map at this zoom level?

00:07:10.312 --> 00:07:11.770
Well first of all,
you can't really

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:15.686
differentiate between the cities
and the states in the US there.

00:07:15.686 --> 00:07:17.560
You can't really see
where the mountains are.

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:20.315
You can't see where the forests
are, and where the deserts are.

00:07:20.315 --> 00:07:23.530
This map isn't really doing
everything that it needs to.

00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:27.100
So when we did the redesign, we
answered all these questions.

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:28.700
Now you can clearly
see the difference

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:30.389
between countries and states.

00:07:30.389 --> 00:07:31.930
We've got elevation
data, so that you

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:34.380
can see where the
mountain ranges are.

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:36.600
And we have vegetation
data too, so you

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:40.920
can see the lush green areas and
the more barren orange areas.

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:43.850
And plus also, we used a new
brighter, more vibrant color

00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:46.070
palette, so this feels
much more on brand

00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:48.700
than how it did before.

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:51.020
The same is true at
deeper zoom levels, too.

00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:53.804
This is the map of how San
Francisco used to look.

00:07:53.804 --> 00:07:55.970
And you can see here our
heritage, that basically we

00:07:55.970 --> 00:07:57.490
just used to be a road map.

00:07:57.490 --> 00:07:59.240
But that's really
all you can see here.

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:01.476
But even the roads, they're
kind of overwhelming.

00:08:01.476 --> 00:08:02.600
They're really, really fat.

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:05.010
And this orange highlight
color and the yellow

00:08:05.010 --> 00:08:08.070
is being used way too much
and not sparingly enough.

00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:10.380
And you also can't see all
of the other information

00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:12.340
that people care about
at this zoom level.

00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:13.960
You can't see the neighborhoods.

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:15.420
You can't see public transit.

00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:17.370
You can't see where
the parks are.

00:08:17.370 --> 00:08:20.880
So we really want to
redesign this, too.

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:23.140
So this new design answers
all of the questions

00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:26.000
that people need to know
about from a city level too.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.250
You can still see the road
hierarchy very clearly,

00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:29.340
but it's cleaner.

00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:32.010
You can now see the
neighborhoods too.

00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:34.309
You can see the businesses,
the points of interest.

00:08:34.309 --> 00:08:36.049
You can see the
transit information.

00:08:36.049 --> 00:08:39.140
You can see all of this stuff.

00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:41.500
Now another example
is around this concept

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:43.169
of a map of a place.

00:08:43.169 --> 00:08:46.712
So let's imagine that
tomorrow after I/O

00:08:46.712 --> 00:08:48.170
we're all going to
go for a picnic.

00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:50.440
And we're going to meet
in the Pullens Gardens.

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:52.350
And I share this map with you.

00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:56.190
Now on first glance, this
map looks fairly reasonable.

00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:58.020
But if you look
closer, this really

00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:00.250
isn't the best map that
I could have given you.

00:09:00.250 --> 00:09:02.630
So for a start, there's
a ton of labels on here

00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:04.450
that you really don't
need to know about.

00:09:04.450 --> 00:09:07.054
And some of the labels you
wish were there are missing.

00:09:07.054 --> 00:09:09.220
So if you look at the Pullens
Gardens in the middle,

00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:10.910
you can see Penton
Place bordering it.

00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:13.460
But you can't see the names
of those other two streets.

00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:17.250
So surely we can do
better than this.

00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:19.760
So we took inspiration
from the kind of map

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:21.950
that you might draw on
the back of a napkin,

00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:25.510
if you were telling your friend
how to get to this place.

00:09:25.510 --> 00:09:27.070
In that kind of map,
people will only

00:09:27.070 --> 00:09:29.770
show the most
important information.

00:09:29.770 --> 00:09:31.430
You can see here
that all we're doing

00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:34.860
is we're highlighting the
major roads that are landmarks

00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:37.632
and the roads that are nearby
and bordering this place.

00:09:37.632 --> 00:09:39.590
These are the roads that
you need to know about

00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:41.256
to get to this place,
and the other ones

00:09:41.256 --> 00:09:43.530
are much less important.

00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:46.410
We even developed a
pretty snazzy algorithm

00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:48.470
to approximate
this kind of data,

00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:51.035
where we look at anonymized
logs of all of the directions

00:09:51.035 --> 00:09:52.660
that anyone has ever
got to this place.

00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:54.480
And we look at the
most popular ones.

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:56.300
And if you're interested
on how this works,

00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:59.090
we get a Tech Talk last year
at I/O that's available online,

00:09:59.090 --> 00:10:00.810
that goes into more depth.

00:10:00.810 --> 00:10:02.174
But so here we go.

00:10:02.174 --> 00:10:03.090
We've got these roads.

00:10:03.090 --> 00:10:04.673
We've got the ones
that are important.

00:10:04.673 --> 00:10:06.210
But now we have to
decide how we're

00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:08.990
going to render
these on the map.

00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:10.940
So the first idea
we tried was we

00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:13.840
thought, OK, let's take
these important roads.

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:15.590
And we're going to
visually lift these up.

00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:16.930
And make them very prominent.

00:10:16.930 --> 00:10:18.804
And all of the other
roads we're going to let

00:10:18.804 --> 00:10:20.310
sink back into the background.

00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:21.970
And this kind of
conceptually works.

00:10:21.970 --> 00:10:23.386
You can see that
it's a little bit

00:10:23.386 --> 00:10:24.784
like that napkin map we had.

00:10:24.784 --> 00:10:26.200
But there's one
really big problem

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:27.750
with this, which
is that we've lost

00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:29.570
the sense of road hierarchy.

00:10:29.570 --> 00:10:31.420
You can now know longer
tell the difference

00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:34.460
between the big major
arterial roads and the more

00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:36.284
minor, local roads.

00:10:36.284 --> 00:10:38.700
So we had to come up with a
solution that didn't interfere

00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:40.710
with the fundamental
road network.

00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:42.710
So back to the drawing board.

00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:43.670
We try another version.

00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:46.730
And we thought what if
all of the roads are grey.

00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:49.830
And we can convey the
network using widths instead.

00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:52.589
And what we'll do is we'll
light up these important roads.

00:10:52.589 --> 00:10:55.130
And this actually looks pretty
cool, even on the [INAUDIBLE],

00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:56.860
you can kind of see
the concept there.

00:10:56.860 --> 00:10:59.290
But what happened when we
built this thing is as you're

00:10:59.290 --> 00:11:02.510
clicking around,
the roads changing

00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:04.390
was just far too
visually jarring.

00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:07.000
It created much
too much prominence

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.890
for what the feature deserved.

00:11:08.890 --> 00:11:11.470
So, threw that
idea away as well.

00:11:11.470 --> 00:11:12.990
And we came up with
this other idea.

00:11:12.990 --> 00:11:15.460
We thought, well, the
way the algorithm works

00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:18.380
is it's basically
taking directions.

00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:20.742
So why don't we just draw
these tiny little arrows,

00:11:20.742 --> 00:11:22.450
because it's all about
getting directions

00:11:22.450 --> 00:11:24.700
from the north, the south,
and the east, and the west.

00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:26.350
This seems like a
cool idea, right?

00:11:26.350 --> 00:11:28.564
But then we put this
in front of people.

00:11:28.564 --> 00:11:30.105
And this didn't work
too well either.

00:11:30.105 --> 00:11:32.360
We were too close
to the algorithm.

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:34.640
And it turned out that
the users were confused

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:37.810
between real sets of directions
and these weird little blue

00:11:37.810 --> 00:11:39.860
arrows we were
drawing everywhere.

00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:42.130
But the good thing about
all of these explorations

00:11:42.130 --> 00:11:43.960
was that we learned something.

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:46.240
So that let us finally
come up with the end design

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:47.990
that we did.

00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:50.400
This answers all
of the problems.

00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:52.800
Now the most important
roads are brighter

00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:54.471
and they're highlighted.

00:11:54.471 --> 00:11:55.470
They're labeled as well.

00:11:55.470 --> 00:11:57.844
You can see that those roads
next to Pullens Gardens that

00:11:57.844 --> 00:12:00.090
weren't labeled before,
are-- Crampton Street,

00:12:00.090 --> 00:12:02.630
Iliffe Street, Amelia Street.

00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:05.144
And the change is actually
quite subtle as well.

00:12:05.144 --> 00:12:06.810
Because the other
roads are still there,

00:12:06.810 --> 00:12:08.630
but they've just sunk into
the background a little bit

00:12:08.630 --> 00:12:10.820
and the most important
roads have lifted slightly,

00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:12.236
this is not such
a dramatic change

00:12:12.236 --> 00:12:13.850
as you go and click
around the map.

00:12:13.850 --> 00:12:16.050
It subtly draws people's
eye, without being

00:12:16.050 --> 00:12:19.460
a massive headline feature.

00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:23.240
To give you another example
around search results.

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:27.015
So here, this is a search
for bars in Sydney.

00:12:27.015 --> 00:12:28.640
And there's something
quite interesting

00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:30.090
going on with this map too.

00:12:30.090 --> 00:12:32.160
Which is that we
have a lot of places

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:34.730
that are labeled on the
map, but none of these

00:12:34.730 --> 00:12:36.420
are the places that
you've asked for.

00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:38.955
These are all the generic
things that were left on the map

00:12:38.955 --> 00:12:39.810
from before.

00:12:39.810 --> 00:12:43.100
Sushi Train, Oxford Vintage
Cellars, Darlinghurst.

00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:46.207
And the very thing that you're
interested in-- the bars--

00:12:46.207 --> 00:12:47.040
they're not labeled.

00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:48.210
They're the only
thing we don't label.

00:12:48.210 --> 00:12:49.140
This is crazy.

00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:50.650
So we've just got
these red pins.

00:12:50.650 --> 00:12:53.610
And there's a letter, and you
have to cross reference it.

00:12:53.610 --> 00:12:55.327
And part of this was
because we didn't

00:12:55.327 --> 00:12:57.160
use to be able to
dynamically render labels,

00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:57.868
but now we could.

00:12:57.868 --> 00:13:01.310
So we thought OK, we can
definitely do better than this.

00:13:01.310 --> 00:13:02.560
So here's what we first tried.

00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:04.980
We thought, well
the search results,

00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:08.437
they're conceptually the
same as a landmark really.

00:13:08.437 --> 00:13:11.020
They're just a thing that we're
going to highlight on the map.

00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:13.269
So why don't we just draw
them the same as a landmark.

00:13:13.269 --> 00:13:15.510
And we'll just draw a little
red circle around them

00:13:15.510 --> 00:13:17.110
to highlight them.

00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:19.760
But this had problems, which
is that it looked kind of messy

00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:21.300
as you started zooming out.

00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:24.070
But even more fundamentally,
you couldn't tell the difference

00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:27.510
between the most relevant search
results and the search results.

00:13:27.510 --> 00:13:29.430
So it could get a
bit overwhelming.

00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:31.540
So how are we going
to solve that.

00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:34.430
We thought OK, what we can
do is we can put the star

00:13:34.430 --> 00:13:36.140
ratings directly on the map.

00:13:36.140 --> 00:13:37.670
This seems like a good idea.

00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:39.380
But actually, here
you can see this

00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:41.110
isn't working so well, either.

00:13:41.110 --> 00:13:43.087
The star ratings
and the red dots

00:13:43.087 --> 00:13:44.670
are kind of competing
with each other,

00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:46.620
and the whole thing
looks a bit overwhelming.

00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:49.640
And it also turns out that star
ratings are not the best way

00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:51.050
to differentiate between places.

00:13:51.050 --> 00:13:54.690
Because all the top places tend
to be about four stars anyway.

00:13:54.690 --> 00:13:58.220
So what's a more human
way of doing this?

00:13:58.220 --> 00:13:59.330
We thought aha.

00:13:59.330 --> 00:14:01.650
What we could do is we
could take the top places.

00:14:01.650 --> 00:14:04.800
And we could differentiate them
with some human readable text.

00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:06.650
So you can see
here that Esan Thai

00:14:06.650 --> 00:14:08.605
is known for its
pineapple fried rice.

00:14:08.605 --> 00:14:11.857
But Aroy Thai is known
for the Pad Thai.

00:14:11.857 --> 00:14:13.440
Now this seemed like
a strong concept.

00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:15.550
But even this version
was lacking as well.

00:14:15.550 --> 00:14:17.967
Because typographically,
you couldn't really

00:14:17.967 --> 00:14:20.550
tell the difference between the
top and the secondary research

00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:21.480
results.

00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:23.480
And also we've lost some
of the key information.

00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:26.500
You can no longer now see what
type of business each of these

00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:27.000
are.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.500
We don't have the
knife and fork anymore.

00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:31.800
So with the learnings from
all of these different

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:34.080
explorations, we finally
came up with something

00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:36.340
that really worked.

00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:40.532
We used a bright red color to
indicate the search results.

00:14:40.532 --> 00:14:42.240
And now they're
conceptually very similar

00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:45.770
than the landmarks,
which are much more set

00:14:45.770 --> 00:14:46.900
in the background.

00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:48.691
You can tell the
difference between the top

00:14:48.691 --> 00:14:50.740
and the secondary
results through size.

00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:53.420
And we've still got this very
useful text string, which

00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:56.660
says herb marinated
chicken, or whatever.

00:14:56.660 --> 00:14:58.800
So we put this first
in front of users.

00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:00.979
And we were super
excited to see how

00:15:00.979 --> 00:15:02.270
their reaction was going to be.

00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:04.010
We expected them
to be blown away.

00:15:04.010 --> 00:15:04.572
Wow.

00:15:04.572 --> 00:15:06.280
You've labeled search
results on the map.

00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:06.946
This is awesome.

00:15:06.946 --> 00:15:08.350
No one's ever done this before.

00:15:08.350 --> 00:15:11.694
And what actually happened
was nobody noticed.

00:15:11.694 --> 00:15:13.360
And we realized that
that's actually OK.

00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:15.980
Because of course the
search results are labeled.

00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:17.250
Weren't you doing that before?

00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:20.080
People instantly forgot that
we didn't used to do that.

00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:22.620
And it's a reminder that
sometimes the best design--

00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:23.920
people won't even notice it.

00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:26.605
It will just work
and get out the way.

00:15:26.605 --> 00:15:28.230
So Annette's going
to give you a couple

00:15:28.230 --> 00:15:30.980
more details around
place details.

00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:32.720
ANNETTE LEONG: Similar
to the napkin map

00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:35.920
design and the search results
and signposts that Jonah gave,

00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:38.960
we are still questioned a
lot on the place details.

00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:41.210
In the old maps, when
you searched for bars,

00:15:41.210 --> 00:15:43.510
there's a list of results
in the left-hand panel

00:15:43.510 --> 00:15:45.970
and also on the map.

00:15:45.970 --> 00:15:47.710
When you click on
the result, whether

00:15:47.710 --> 00:15:50.320
from the left-hand
panel or on the map,

00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:51.810
there was this
informational window

00:15:51.810 --> 00:15:53.500
that appeared on the map.

00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:56.890
We asked ourselves, why does
this informational window

00:15:56.890 --> 00:15:59.980
have to be that big and
cover so much of the map?

00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:03.680
And secondly, why is the
information showing twice?

00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:06.530
The same information is
showing in the left-hand panel

00:16:06.530 --> 00:16:09.390
and also in the
informational window.

00:16:09.390 --> 00:16:11.350
The more we question
the UI, the more

00:16:11.350 --> 00:16:16.480
we can get a better sense of
how we can improve upon it.

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:19.910
We tried a version, what
if we took away all the UI

00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:22.520
and had the search
box only appear

00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:24.370
when you click on a place.

00:16:24.370 --> 00:16:28.480
It didn't really work well,
because you expect the search

00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:31.720
box to be at a
persistent location.

00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:35.920
So you click on the
place and it shows up

00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:37.210
at a different location.

00:16:37.210 --> 00:16:38.400
It's a style strange.

00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:41.450
So we ditched the idea
and tried another version.

00:16:41.450 --> 00:16:43.910
What if we want to
show more of the map?

00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:48.170
So we show the text on the
transparent background.

00:16:48.170 --> 00:16:51.590
This also didn't really work
well, because as you can see,

00:16:51.590 --> 00:16:54.930
the text can be hard to read
against different backgrounds.

00:16:54.930 --> 00:16:57.390
And also, the actions
that you may need,

00:16:57.390 --> 00:17:00.310
like getting directions
and saving a place,

00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:04.060
are hidden with
another click away.

00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:07.430
What if we try a version
that the text radiated

00:17:07.430 --> 00:17:08.710
from the place you clicked.

00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:12.020
Visually it looked cool
and somewhat interesting.

00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:15.210
But it also opened up
another can of worms.

00:17:15.210 --> 00:17:19.180
Like the space limitations
and also legibility.

00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:23.369
And the more we questioned
all these explorations,

00:17:23.369 --> 00:17:25.010
we learned from them.

00:17:25.010 --> 00:17:29.560
So finally, we landed on
this version where the text--

00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:31.390
the information about
the place is always

00:17:31.390 --> 00:17:35.660
showing in the upper left
corner in a predictable way.

00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:40.920
And this information
box can be minimized

00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:43.160
when you want to
see more of the map.

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:45.550
Sometimes the problems
can be obvious,

00:17:45.550 --> 00:17:48.530
but the right
solution might not be.

00:17:48.530 --> 00:17:52.020
It takes questioning everything,
exploring everything,

00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:53.530
to get to a much simpler design.

00:17:56.084 --> 00:17:56.750
JONAH JONES: OK.

00:17:56.750 --> 00:17:59.330
So the final lesson is
that it's really important

00:17:59.330 --> 00:18:01.290
to listen to your users.

00:18:01.290 --> 00:18:03.540
And there's a bunch of
different ways you can do this.

00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:05.600
You could run usability studies.

00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:07.630
You can study your user metrics.

00:18:07.630 --> 00:18:09.720
You can directly
solicit user feedback.

00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:11.820
Or you can run an
internal dogfood.

00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:14.710
Dogfood is the idea that
you eat your own dogfood.

00:18:14.710 --> 00:18:17.780
So you test the app internally,
before you release it

00:18:17.780 --> 00:18:19.719
into the wild, to
the general public.

00:18:19.719 --> 00:18:21.510
But it's important that
you do all of these

00:18:21.510 --> 00:18:22.910
and don't just focus on one.

00:18:22.910 --> 00:18:24.660
I'm going to give you
a couple of examples

00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:27.160
of why this is important.

00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:29.580
So the first is around speed.

00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:32.570
So when we first
launched the new Maps,

00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:34.450
we heard some users
were giving us

00:18:34.450 --> 00:18:36.690
feedback that we needed
to make it faster.

00:18:36.690 --> 00:18:38.630
And we thought, this
is kind of interesting.

00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:40.590
Because when we
looked at our logs,

00:18:40.590 --> 00:18:44.520
average speed was-- the new Maps
was faster than the old Maps.

00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:47.040
But it turns out that
wasn't the whole picture.

00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:49.530
It turns out the for
people with fast computers

00:18:49.530 --> 00:18:51.660
and fast network
connections, the new Maps

00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:54.530
was indeed significantly faster.

00:18:54.530 --> 00:18:56.120
For people with
average computers

00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:59.120
and average connections, the new
Maps was a bit faster or about

00:18:59.120 --> 00:18:59.880
the same.

00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:02.700
But for people with slow
computers or slow internet

00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:05.130
connections, the
new Maps was slower.

00:19:05.130 --> 00:19:06.600
That's why people
were saying this.

00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:08.870
This is a problem.

00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:12.540
They were kind of seeing
something like this.

00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:15.470
They were seeing this
extended loading screen.

00:19:15.470 --> 00:19:17.610
And they were waiting
for that to load.

00:19:17.610 --> 00:19:18.320
Oh, man.

00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:22.420
This is so slow, come
on, come on, come on.

00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:24.090
OK, it's loaded.

00:19:24.090 --> 00:19:27.080
And so we sent our crack
team of engineers on this.

00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:28.400
And they worked night and day.

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:30.108
And they managed to
get the loading speed

00:19:30.108 --> 00:19:31.780
down to half of
what it used to be.

00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:35.410
And this was pretty amazing,
but it's still not fast enough.

00:19:35.410 --> 00:19:38.970
So this needed a bit of
a more creative solution.

00:19:38.970 --> 00:19:42.670
And we realized that people
tend to do one of two things

00:19:42.670 --> 00:19:44.460
when they first
load up Google Maps.

00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:46.340
Number one is that
they just kind of stare

00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:48.540
at the map tiles for one
or two or three seconds.

00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:51.180
Just to get a sense
of orientation.

00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:52.760
And number two
was if they're not

00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:55.040
doing that, they tend
to go to the search box

00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:56.620
and just start typing.

00:19:56.620 --> 00:19:58.870
So we thought, what if
we could be smarter.

00:19:58.870 --> 00:20:01.660
What if-- is this
the new loading

00:20:01.660 --> 00:20:02.760
sequence or the old one.

00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:03.648
It's the new one.

00:20:03.648 --> 00:20:04.980
OK.

00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:10.900
What if we could load the map
tiles first, in a static way.

00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:12.725
So they're not the
normal 3D ones.

00:20:12.725 --> 00:20:14.350
These are just a
quick set of map tiles

00:20:14.350 --> 00:20:15.701
that we can load immediately.

00:20:15.701 --> 00:20:17.200
This gives all those
people who just

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:18.620
want to look at
the map something

00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:20.350
to do much, much quicker.

00:20:20.350 --> 00:20:22.440
And what if we could
enable the search box,

00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:24.600
so that people can
type into that.

00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:27.035
Now, in a much, much
quicker amount of time,

00:20:27.035 --> 00:20:29.160
we're showing the map and
we're letting people type

00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:30.294
into the search box.

00:20:30.294 --> 00:20:32.210
And by the time they're
done doing that stuff,

00:20:32.210 --> 00:20:33.890
the rest of the map is loaded.

00:20:33.890 --> 00:20:38.230
So this is a sign that real
speed is very, very important.

00:20:38.230 --> 00:20:40.890
But the perceived speed can
be very important as well.

00:20:40.890 --> 00:20:44.180
The number of people who are
dissatisfied with the speed

00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:47.240
went down dramatically
after we did this change.

00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:49.730
There's a second example too.

00:20:49.730 --> 00:20:52.740
And this is what happens
when you click on a place,

00:20:52.740 --> 00:20:54.840
and then we load
this new map that's

00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:56.705
built for this place
with the new roads.

00:20:56.705 --> 00:20:58.330
And there's actually
quite a few things

00:20:58.330 --> 00:21:00.150
going on here that
you'll notice.

00:21:00.150 --> 00:21:02.900
So the first thing is
that when we click,

00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:04.840
we have to wait for
200 milliseconds

00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:07.270
to differentiate between
if this is a click, which

00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:10.095
is to select something, or
a double click to zoom in.

00:21:10.095 --> 00:21:12.220
And there's nothing, really,
you can do about this.

00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:15.030
But if you just wait,
it will feel slow.

00:21:15.030 --> 00:21:18.420
So what we do is we immediately
do a little ripple event that

00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:19.900
responds to the first click.

00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:21.980
And after that 200
milliseconds time out,

00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:24.890
that's when we begin to
lift the pen up in the air.

00:21:24.890 --> 00:21:28.230
So this now feels immediately
much more responsive.

00:21:28.230 --> 00:21:30.800
The second thing that happens
is that the pin jumps up

00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:32.400
into the air and then lands.

00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:35.260
And as it lands, the map
responds and updates.

00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:38.160
And this is done because as
soon as we know that there's

00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:40.470
been a click, we have to
go back to the server,

00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:43.109
figure out what all these roads
are that we need to highlight,

00:21:43.109 --> 00:21:45.150
come back again to the
client, and then re-render

00:21:45.150 --> 00:21:46.570
these new map tiles.

00:21:46.570 --> 00:21:49.660
And had we waited to do
that, before showing the pin,

00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:51.029
that would feel laggy.

00:21:51.029 --> 00:21:52.570
But lad we shown
the pin immediately,

00:21:52.570 --> 00:21:54.960
and then the map tiles had
updated sometime later,

00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:56.750
that would also feel laggy.

00:21:56.750 --> 00:21:58.836
So this solution lets
us begin the animation.

00:21:58.836 --> 00:22:00.710
Everyone's watching
that, they're distracted,

00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:01.460
and then it lands.

00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:03.490
And then the map tiles update.

00:22:03.490 --> 00:22:05.810
And this not only
hides the loading,

00:22:05.810 --> 00:22:08.580
but it also adds personality
and character to the map.

00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:12.199
So we managed to kill two
birds with one stone here.

00:22:12.199 --> 00:22:13.740
Annette's going to
give you some more

00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:15.692
examples around Street View.

00:22:18.290 --> 00:22:22.320
ANNETTE LEONG: Imagery was
one of the major features

00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:24.190
in the redesign.

00:22:24.190 --> 00:22:28.070
We wanted to make discovering
images much more easier.

00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:30.890
In the old maps, there was
this to little yellow guy

00:22:30.890 --> 00:22:35.070
that we called Pegman, where
you have to click the Pegman

00:22:35.070 --> 00:22:38.830
and jerk him to the map, in
order to see Street View.

00:22:38.830 --> 00:22:41.820
And some people did
not discover that.

00:22:41.820 --> 00:22:46.480
So in the redesign, we wanted
to put the images up front.

00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:49.930
So we replaced the Pegman
with a sequence of images

00:22:49.930 --> 00:22:52.330
at the bottom.

00:22:52.330 --> 00:22:56.630
We tested this design
in our internal dogfood.

00:22:56.630 --> 00:22:59.840
We were rather surprised that
one of the comments we got

00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:03.420
was that, where did
you put Street View.

00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:05.510
So in this design,
we thought that we

00:23:05.510 --> 00:23:10.350
had a clean and organized
way to organize everything.

00:23:10.350 --> 00:23:13.950
Information is at the top, and
the images are at the bottom.

00:23:13.950 --> 00:23:17.930
But that wasn't what users saw.

00:23:17.930 --> 00:23:20.980
When the users saw the
information at the top,

00:23:20.980 --> 00:23:22.900
they were questioning
where was Street View.

00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:25.370
And they saw the
images at the bottom,

00:23:25.370 --> 00:23:27.760
and they questioned
what those were.

00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:31.730
In order to match the
user's mental model better,

00:23:31.730 --> 00:23:33.100
we changed our design.

00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:38.360
We grouped the information and
images together in one place.

00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:41.610
And users can still see
images about the neighborhood

00:23:41.610 --> 00:23:45.040
by opening the imagery
cursor at the bottom.

00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:47.740
Finally, people are able to
get into Street View more

00:23:47.740 --> 00:23:49.730
intuitively.

00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:51.080
Problem solved.

00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:53.640
But there was another problem.

00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:57.090
In our usability study,
we noticed that once

00:23:57.090 --> 00:23:59.500
people got into Street
View they actually

00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:00.880
did not move around much.

00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:03.010
They actually were missing
out on all the fun.

00:24:03.010 --> 00:24:03.790
What a shame.

00:24:03.790 --> 00:24:05.440
How could we fix it?

00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:08.640
So we looked again, we
looked into our old UI.

00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:10.470
There was this
circular highlight

00:24:10.470 --> 00:24:12.140
that followed the
cursor, supposed

00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:17.080
to indicate that you
could click and move.

00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:19.510
But some people
did not get that.

00:24:19.510 --> 00:24:22.210
We tried a bunch of
designs, and finally we

00:24:22.210 --> 00:24:25.130
made two small but
important changes.

00:24:25.130 --> 00:24:29.080
One, we changed the
cursor from an arrow

00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:31.740
to a hand with a
pointing finger.

00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:35.360
Now people understand that
they can click to proceed.

00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:39.540
Secondly, we added an arrow
inside the circle highlight.

00:24:39.540 --> 00:24:41.650
Now people understand
that when they click

00:24:41.650 --> 00:24:44.740
they will also moved
toward that direction.

00:24:44.740 --> 00:24:47.750
This all leads to some
really great news.

00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:50.700
Our Street View usage
was up three times,

00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:52.810
according to our metrics.

00:24:52.810 --> 00:24:56.270
In the meantime, something
strange was happening.

00:24:56.270 --> 00:24:59.120
People were still asking
to bring back Pegman.

00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:00.970
We were wondering why.

00:25:00.970 --> 00:25:03.670
Our Street View usage
was up three times.

00:25:03.670 --> 00:25:06.530
Why are people still
asking to bring Pegman?

00:25:06.530 --> 00:25:08.870
So we looked into it further.

00:25:08.870 --> 00:25:11.950
Turned out there's a
group of users like Anita,

00:25:11.950 --> 00:25:13.730
who thinks of a place first.

00:25:13.730 --> 00:25:18.710
So she would search and see
Street View, she is happy.

00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:21.090
This explains why
the new design was

00:25:21.090 --> 00:25:25.890
successful to help Anita to
discover images much easier.

00:25:25.890 --> 00:25:31.360
Which also explains why our
usage was up three times.

00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:34.640
There's another group
of users like Susannah,

00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:37.080
who thinks of Street View first.

00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:39.370
So she did not search.

00:25:39.370 --> 00:25:42.160
And she's not seeing any images.

00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:45.490
Nor the Pegman like
in the old maps.

00:25:45.490 --> 00:25:47.320
She is stuck.

00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:50.240
So we decided to
bring Pegman back.

00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:53.220
And now Pegman is happier,
because he's living closer

00:25:53.220 --> 00:25:55.390
to the imagery carousel.

00:25:55.390 --> 00:25:58.030
And our users like Anita and
Susannah are happier too.

00:26:03.620 --> 00:26:05.130
Sometimes when you
design a product,

00:26:05.130 --> 00:26:10.500
it may not be matching how
your users use your product.

00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:14.660
You may have to listen carefully
and observe carefully, in order

00:26:14.660 --> 00:26:18.840
to improve your design further.

00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:22.830
Finally, it's really important
to close the feedback loop.

00:26:22.830 --> 00:26:26.410
During our preview period,
we received tons of feedback

00:26:26.410 --> 00:26:28.060
from our users.

00:26:28.060 --> 00:26:31.445
As soon as we fixed an
issue that users requested

00:26:31.445 --> 00:26:35.860
or suggested, we wrote an
email to thank them and let

00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:38.340
them know that their
issues have been fixed.

00:26:38.340 --> 00:26:39.980
And people love this.

00:26:39.980 --> 00:26:43.840
98% of our users who
received our email

00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:46.500
would like to continue
to receive communication

00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:47.340
like this.

00:26:47.340 --> 00:26:51.690
It really showed that to
your users that you listened,

00:26:51.690 --> 00:26:53.620
that you care, and that
they have been heard.

00:26:56.990 --> 00:26:57.950
JONAH JONES: OK.

00:26:57.950 --> 00:27:00.480
So back to the
original question.

00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:04.790
How can you design your
apps for a billion people?

00:27:04.790 --> 00:27:07.560
You think big, you
question everything,

00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:09.950
and you listen to your users.

00:27:09.950 --> 00:27:11.273
Thank you very much.

00:27:11.273 --> 00:27:13.130
[APPLAUSE]

00:27:13.130 --> 00:27:14.171
ANNETTE LEONG: Thank you.

00:27:18.035 --> 00:27:21.430
JONAH JONES: And we've got 17
minutes left for questions.

00:27:21.430 --> 00:27:24.230
So if you've got any questions,
there's a couple of mics there.

00:27:24.230 --> 00:27:25.890
And we'll be very
happy to answer them.

00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:30.610
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:27:30.610 --> 00:27:31.942
Thank you for the talk.

00:27:31.942 --> 00:27:33.900
And also thank you for
redesigning Google Maps.

00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:34.858
I think it's fantastic.

00:27:39.090 --> 00:27:43.400
I had exactly the Pegman issue
when Google Maps was resigned.

00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:49.300
As a UX guy, I was like,
it felt like a real misstep

00:27:49.300 --> 00:27:50.575
for the design.

00:27:50.575 --> 00:27:52.950
And when I eventually found
him down in the bottom corner

00:27:52.950 --> 00:27:54.680
there, I was a
little bit confused

00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:59.330
as to why you guys moved
like from a purely UI design

00:27:59.330 --> 00:28:00.210
perspective.

00:28:00.210 --> 00:28:05.470
Why he's down there with the
settings and also the tour.

00:28:05.470 --> 00:28:07.790
But there are also some
options at the top right

00:28:07.790 --> 00:28:10.580
and you can also do stuff
in the top left corner.

00:28:10.580 --> 00:28:13.490
And there's also Street View in
the bottom left corner as well.

00:28:13.490 --> 00:28:17.510
It just seemed to me to
not follow a hierarchy,

00:28:17.510 --> 00:28:19.066
or like a functional hierarchy.

00:28:19.066 --> 00:28:20.440
So can you talk
a bit about that?

00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:21.190
JONAH JONES: Sure.

00:28:21.190 --> 00:28:25.640
I mean the original thinking
behind taking away Pegman

00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:28.410
actually was if you're going to
redesign a product like Google

00:28:28.410 --> 00:28:30.119
Maps, there's like
thousands of features.

00:28:30.119 --> 00:28:31.659
And we had to be
really, really bold.

00:28:31.659 --> 00:28:34.220
And we wanted to see how much
we could take away and get away

00:28:34.220 --> 00:28:34.720
with.

00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:37.417
And like 90% of the
stuff we took away,

00:28:37.417 --> 00:28:38.750
we got away with, which is good.

00:28:38.750 --> 00:28:40.560
So you managed to
simplify, but we always

00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:41.520
knew there was going
to be somethings

00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:42.690
that we had to bring back.

00:28:42.690 --> 00:28:43.720
And the Pegman was one of them.

00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:46.440
And it was because of these two
mental models that people had.

00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:51.640
A bit of insight is
that conceptually we'd

00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:55.240
always thought of Pegman as the
deepest zoom of Google Maps.

00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:57.560
And there used to be
this behavior that you'd

00:28:57.560 --> 00:28:59.110
zoom in, zoom in,
zoom in, zoom in,

00:28:59.110 --> 00:29:00.860
and then suddenly
you'd hit Street View.

00:29:00.860 --> 00:29:02.276
And that was why
Pegman used to be

00:29:02.276 --> 00:29:04.310
on top of the zoom
slider over there.

00:29:04.310 --> 00:29:06.600
But we would constantly see
people zooming in and then

00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:08.990
accidentally getting into
Street View, and like--

00:29:08.990 --> 00:29:10.360
and then coming back out again.

00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:11.901
So it turns out that
it didn't really

00:29:11.901 --> 00:29:14.892
make sense, conceptually, to
our users to have it that way.

00:29:14.892 --> 00:29:16.850
And that's why when we
brought the Pegman back,

00:29:16.850 --> 00:29:19.760
we brought him back
in the imagery area

00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:20.846
down on the bottom right.

00:29:20.846 --> 00:29:23.220
Because that's where you summon
all of the other imagery.

00:29:23.220 --> 00:29:25.553
If you pull that up, that's
where the Street Views live,

00:29:25.553 --> 00:29:29.030
that's where the panorama
photos live and everything else.

00:29:29.030 --> 00:29:31.652
So it felt like that was
Pegman's natural home,

00:29:31.652 --> 00:29:33.610
even though it was a
different place than where

00:29:33.610 --> 00:29:35.100
he'd originally been living.

00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:36.775
So that's why we put him there.

00:29:40.790 --> 00:29:41.580
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:29:41.580 --> 00:29:45.840
When do you make the decision
to do such a large redesign?

00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:49.340
I mean for applications with
so many users and things

00:29:49.340 --> 00:29:52.920
like that, at what point
do you stop saying, oh we

00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:53.760
should do that.

00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:55.804
And say all right,
we're starting now.

00:29:55.804 --> 00:29:57.220
JONAH JONES: We'd
kind of reached-

00:29:57.220 --> 00:29:58.678
I alluded to this
at the beginning,

00:29:58.678 --> 00:30:02.867
but we kind of reached the stage
where most people kind of felt

00:30:02.867 --> 00:30:04.450
like they were happy
with Google Maps.

00:30:04.450 --> 00:30:05.200
And that was fine.

00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:07.830
But we realized that
first of all, there

00:30:07.830 --> 00:30:09.190
was a big opportunity cost.

00:30:09.190 --> 00:30:11.000
Because it wasn't
doing all these things

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:12.060
we wanted it to do.

00:30:12.060 --> 00:30:14.370
But second of all, it was
kind of running out of space,

00:30:14.370 --> 00:30:15.764
adding all these new features.

00:30:15.764 --> 00:30:16.930
And we were adding features.

00:30:16.930 --> 00:30:19.750
And all the discussions were
always around discoverability,

00:30:19.750 --> 00:30:22.280
because everyone wants their
feature to be big and bold.

00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:24.446
But it means all the other
ones can't be discovered.

00:30:24.446 --> 00:30:26.530
And so we were basically
running out of space

00:30:26.530 --> 00:30:27.540
to fit new features.

00:30:27.540 --> 00:30:31.110
So we wanted to rethink it
and simplify it and also

00:30:31.110 --> 00:30:33.580
build a frameworks to let us
add more and more new stuff

00:30:33.580 --> 00:30:34.890
in a contextual way.

00:30:34.890 --> 00:30:38.422
So it was kind of like
50% necessity, just

00:30:38.422 --> 00:30:40.380
looking into the future
of where we were going.

00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:42.680
And 50% that we wanted
to try something new.

00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:44.420
And as we mentioned
before, just kind

00:30:44.420 --> 00:30:47.780
of redefine expectations of what
Maps would be, rather than just

00:30:47.780 --> 00:30:50.270
keep plodding away and adding
features to the same thing.

00:30:53.590 --> 00:30:54.510
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:30:54.510 --> 00:30:58.450
So I notice now when
you search for cities,

00:30:58.450 --> 00:31:01.760
you get a nice city border.

00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:05.560
But when you zoom in enough to
figure out whether something's

00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:08.240
in one city or the
other, it disappears.

00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:11.630
And so there's this frustration
of zooming in enough

00:31:11.630 --> 00:31:15.830
to see what you're looking for,
and then you lose your border.

00:31:15.830 --> 00:31:19.180
I wonder if you could
explain the rationale for why

00:31:19.180 --> 00:31:20.702
those disappear.

00:31:20.702 --> 00:31:22.410
JONAH JONES: We actually
have quite a lot

00:31:22.410 --> 00:31:24.493
of heated arguments about
this internally as well.

00:31:24.493 --> 00:31:27.500
Because it turns out that when
people are searching for a city

00:31:27.500 --> 00:31:29.750
or anything, like a
neighborhood or a zip code

00:31:29.750 --> 00:31:32.210
or any of this stuff, you
might want different things.

00:31:32.210 --> 00:31:35.060
Like some people are really
interested in the exact border

00:31:35.060 --> 00:31:35.874
of the city.

00:31:35.874 --> 00:31:38.040
In which case maybe we
should really highlight that,

00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:39.557
get rid of everything else.

00:31:39.557 --> 00:31:41.890
Just show all these stats
about the city and everything.

00:31:41.890 --> 00:31:43.681
But then some other
people, maybe they just

00:31:43.681 --> 00:31:46.226
want to send to
the viewport there.

00:31:46.226 --> 00:31:47.600
Then in that case,
you don't want

00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:49.060
to draw too much
visual attention to it.

00:31:49.060 --> 00:31:50.730
And you want to show
the context too.

00:31:50.730 --> 00:31:54.492
So we try to achieve a balance
between highlighting the thing

00:31:54.492 --> 00:31:56.450
that you've searched for,
but not in such a way

00:31:56.450 --> 00:31:58.400
that it's at the detriment
of anything else.

00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:01.470
So it's just about trying to
balance what everybody wants.

00:32:01.470 --> 00:32:03.831
And you'll probably see this
has changed in the past,

00:32:03.831 --> 00:32:05.330
you'll probably see
it change again,

00:32:05.330 --> 00:32:07.852
as we're trying to tweak
this to best answer

00:32:07.852 --> 00:32:08.810
all of our users needs.

00:32:11.967 --> 00:32:12.870
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:32:12.870 --> 00:32:17.340
I'm wondering if you
have plans to include

00:32:17.340 --> 00:32:20.250
the embed code
somewhere in the new UI?

00:32:20.250 --> 00:32:21.620
Because I can't find it.

00:32:21.620 --> 00:32:24.670
And I always have to switch
back to Classic Maps to get it.

00:32:24.670 --> 00:32:26.920
JONAH JONES: I believe the
embed code is down in the--

00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:30.260
ANNETTE LEONG: Yeah, so it
is actually in the Gear menu.

00:32:30.260 --> 00:32:32.830
It's not the most
intuitive way at all.

00:32:32.830 --> 00:32:36.060
We're still looking into
finding a better place for that.

00:32:36.060 --> 00:32:37.560
If you click into
the Gear menu, you

00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:40.500
should be able to see
share and embed map.

00:32:40.500 --> 00:32:42.800
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:43.740
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:32:43.740 --> 00:32:46.790
I have a question
about 3D buildings

00:32:46.790 --> 00:32:50.960
and mapping and the
3D new imagery system.

00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:54.690
You've just abrogated
it last year.

00:32:54.690 --> 00:33:02.240
And just-- there were users who
were able to build and upload

00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:07.400
by those [INAUDIBLE] using
SketchUp, using Building Maker.

00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:11.150
And it seems maybe two
or three months ago, they

00:33:11.150 --> 00:33:14.110
were not able to just upload
everything, because it

00:33:14.110 --> 00:33:15.190
was canceled.

00:33:15.190 --> 00:33:19.690
And there were more
than 10,000 modelers.

00:33:19.690 --> 00:33:24.500
They had made millions of
buildings since you started.

00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:28.630
And why did you decide
to cancel this project,

00:33:28.630 --> 00:33:31.401
and what's the main reason?

00:33:31.401 --> 00:33:33.400
JONAH JONES: So I'm
probably not the best person

00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:34.110
to talk about this.

00:33:34.110 --> 00:33:36.140
But I can give you like a
more of a design perspective.

00:33:36.140 --> 00:33:37.556
My understanding
on this basically

00:33:37.556 --> 00:33:41.860
is that we try to
kind of automatically

00:33:41.860 --> 00:33:43.614
generate a lot of the
3D buildings we have

00:33:43.614 --> 00:33:46.280
as we've been flying over cities
and stuff and building them up.

00:33:46.280 --> 00:33:48.530
And we do have some
amount of buildings

00:33:48.530 --> 00:33:52.080
that have been
specifically hand-modeled.

00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:54.972
But I'm not 100% sure
on the exact policies

00:33:54.972 --> 00:33:56.430
of what gets included
and what not.

00:33:56.430 --> 00:33:58.390
So if you follow out
with me afterwards,

00:33:58.390 --> 00:33:59.480
we can follow up
with [INAUDIBLE].

00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:01.300
And he'll be able to
answer those questions.

00:34:01.300 --> 00:34:02.674
So come and chat
to us afterwards

00:34:02.674 --> 00:34:04.320
and I'll give you more detail.

00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:05.916
Thanks.

00:34:05.916 --> 00:34:06.830
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:34:06.830 --> 00:34:08.020
I was just curious.

00:34:08.020 --> 00:34:11.469
To what degree was
the redesign informed

00:34:11.469 --> 00:34:19.672
by the needs of low-end mobile
users versus desktop users?

00:34:19.672 --> 00:34:21.880
JONAH JONES: So that's a
really interesting question.

00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:26.550
So the vision of the future
of Google Maps that we talked

00:34:26.550 --> 00:34:29.090
about was very, very
platform agnostic.

00:34:29.090 --> 00:34:32.929
It was about this thing
that's personalized to you.

00:34:32.929 --> 00:34:34.969
It's showing the data
that you care about.

00:34:34.969 --> 00:34:37.100
It can dynamically change
for every single place.

00:34:37.100 --> 00:34:40.090
And we wanted to achieve
this on all platforms.

00:34:40.090 --> 00:34:45.780
And what you saw was that I
guess the first hint of that

00:34:45.780 --> 00:34:48.719
was with the new iOS app that
we built with the new design

00:34:48.719 --> 00:34:49.493
language.

00:34:49.493 --> 00:34:51.659
And then a lot of the new
functionality and concepts

00:34:51.659 --> 00:34:53.402
came into the desktop version.

00:34:53.402 --> 00:34:55.360
And now they're starting
to find their way back

00:34:55.360 --> 00:34:56.790
into the mobile version as well.

00:34:56.790 --> 00:34:59.390
So all of the platforms
are kind of-- they're

00:34:59.390 --> 00:35:01.320
almost like in a race.

00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:02.920
Some are readier
earlier than others.

00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:05.540
But we're all heading
toward this unified future.

00:35:05.540 --> 00:35:08.360
And low-end devices are
going to be very much

00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:10.210
an important part
of that as well.

00:35:10.210 --> 00:35:12.720
It's not something that we've
been focusing heavily on

00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:14.270
to begin with, but
definitely we're

00:35:14.270 --> 00:35:17.340
going to be focusing very
much on speed and devices

00:35:17.340 --> 00:35:20.787
with low connectivity and low
CPU and that kind of thing.

00:35:20.787 --> 00:35:22.870
It's really important to
get those things working,

00:35:22.870 --> 00:35:25.025
especially with the
Android 1 phones coming out

00:35:25.025 --> 00:35:25.870
and everything.

00:35:25.870 --> 00:35:27.060
Actually, I haven't
tried one of those yet,

00:35:27.060 --> 00:35:28.851
but I'm really curious
to see how it works.

00:35:31.497 --> 00:35:33.330
AUDIENCE: More generally,
about the process.

00:35:33.330 --> 00:35:35.800
When you do decide
to do a redesign,

00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:37.850
the three lessons are
sort of like three steps.

00:35:37.850 --> 00:35:40.060
Is there a particular order
that you guys followed?

00:35:40.060 --> 00:35:41.768
Did you listen to
users first, or did you

00:35:41.768 --> 00:35:43.011
try to think big on your own?

00:35:43.011 --> 00:35:44.260
Or is it all at the same time?

00:35:44.260 --> 00:35:46.635
JONAH JONES: It's kind of all
at the same time, actually.

00:35:46.635 --> 00:35:50.810
Because the benefit we had
of working on this product

00:35:50.810 --> 00:35:55.350
for seven years, is that we've
run repeated usability studies.

00:35:55.350 --> 00:35:56.860
We're getting
feedback all the time.

00:35:56.860 --> 00:35:59.137
So we know what our
users' pain points are.

00:35:59.137 --> 00:36:00.720
And we know what
areas of the products

00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:03.170
are being underutilized.

00:36:03.170 --> 00:36:05.670
So we knew, for example, that
we had all this great imagery,

00:36:05.670 --> 00:36:07.070
and people weren't finding it.

00:36:07.070 --> 00:36:08.600
So some of them are
explicit issues.

00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:10.690
And other things are
just opportunity areas.

00:36:10.690 --> 00:36:13.425
So we kind of just have
this idea of oh man,

00:36:13.425 --> 00:36:15.640
this could be so much better.

00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:17.070
So that was just
informing things.

00:36:17.070 --> 00:36:19.750
And then obviously, if you
want to change something and do

00:36:19.750 --> 00:36:21.550
something audacious, you've
got to question everything.

00:36:21.550 --> 00:36:22.720
You've got to think big.

00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:24.094
It's all kind of
part and parcel.

00:36:24.094 --> 00:36:26.340
It's not really a step
one, two, three thing.

00:36:26.340 --> 00:36:29.520
ANNETTE LEONG: Similarly,
like when you build a product,

00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:32.460
you want to focus on
a few key use cases.

00:36:32.460 --> 00:36:34.280
And then constantly,
you're looking back

00:36:34.280 --> 00:36:37.330
at what you designed to see
if you are matching those use

00:36:37.330 --> 00:36:38.230
cases.

00:36:38.230 --> 00:36:40.164
And each time you
are not, then you

00:36:40.164 --> 00:36:42.580
go back to the sketching board,
or talk to the researchers

00:36:42.580 --> 00:36:44.700
how we can improve
the products further.

00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:49.240
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:52.110
I was hoping you could share
a little more about how

00:36:52.110 --> 00:36:54.000
you conduct the user research.

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:56.370
Both before, during,
and after this process

00:36:56.370 --> 00:36:58.485
for around the world.

00:36:58.485 --> 00:37:01.170
It seems like a pretty
difficult problem.

00:37:01.170 --> 00:37:02.902
I'm wondering what
the main steps were.

00:37:02.902 --> 00:37:04.860
JONAH JONES: I wish we
had a researcher with us

00:37:04.860 --> 00:37:05.651
to talk about this.

00:37:05.651 --> 00:37:09.380
But we basically run a variety
of different research studies.

00:37:09.380 --> 00:37:12.547
We can do super small scale
stuff, even within the company,

00:37:12.547 --> 00:37:14.630
where you just go into a
cafe, and you get someone

00:37:14.630 --> 00:37:15.660
to click on stuff.

00:37:15.660 --> 00:37:19.700
We can bring people in and
have them test things out.

00:37:19.700 --> 00:37:22.280
We can go to people's
homes and see

00:37:22.280 --> 00:37:24.390
how they use things
in the real life.

00:37:24.390 --> 00:37:25.970
There's diary
studies, where you can

00:37:25.970 --> 00:37:28.290
get people to document
the things that they need

00:37:28.290 --> 00:37:29.770
every day, and
what they're using.

00:37:29.770 --> 00:37:32.200
And that can be across
different products.

00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:36.490
Obviously, there's the feedback
that you get from users

00:37:36.490 --> 00:37:40.830
when you get to send feedback
from within the product.

00:37:40.830 --> 00:37:41.997
You can look at the metrics.

00:37:41.997 --> 00:37:44.080
You can see what's getting
clicked and what isn't.

00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:46.260
So we kind of used like a
dozen or so different ways

00:37:46.260 --> 00:37:47.862
of getting this,
because they're all

00:37:47.862 --> 00:37:49.320
flawed in their
own different ways,

00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:50.800
so you're trying
to get around it.

00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:53.340
AUDIENCE: And is it something
that if you look at that data

00:37:53.340 --> 00:37:55.499
and say it's not
really making sense

00:37:55.499 --> 00:37:57.040
for a particular
region of the world.

00:37:57.040 --> 00:38:00.560
You'll go out there and
really attentively study that.

00:38:02.719 --> 00:38:04.260
JONAH JONES: You
can certainly notice

00:38:04.260 --> 00:38:06.890
that there are regional
differences in how people use

00:38:06.890 --> 00:38:08.370
things, the kind of things
that they search for,

00:38:08.370 --> 00:38:09.700
the kind of things
that they need.

00:38:09.700 --> 00:38:11.810
And of course the data is
very different as well.

00:38:11.810 --> 00:38:13.399
The data in the
Bay Area is great.

00:38:13.399 --> 00:38:15.940
You go somewhere else, maybe
the data is a lot lower quality.

00:38:15.940 --> 00:38:17.940
So things vary a lot.

00:38:17.940 --> 00:38:19.119
It's really interesting.

00:38:19.119 --> 00:38:21.410
ANNETTE LEONG: And sometimes
when you design a feature,

00:38:21.410 --> 00:38:25.110
you may need multiple rounds of
research and usability testing

00:38:25.110 --> 00:38:25.990
for that.

00:38:25.990 --> 00:38:29.470
And then we had a long period
of time with internal dogfood,

00:38:29.470 --> 00:38:33.160
where we collected a lot of
feedback from internal users.

00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:35.170
So we actually
during that round we

00:38:35.170 --> 00:38:37.800
made the feedback
button super prominent.

00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:40.700
And people wherever they use
and run into any problem,

00:38:40.700 --> 00:38:42.880
they can just click
there and that

00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:46.422
would allow them to easily
file a request or bug.

00:38:46.422 --> 00:38:48.130
JONAH JONES: It's also
worth pointing out

00:38:48.130 --> 00:38:50.010
that we're a very diverse team.

00:38:50.010 --> 00:38:53.210
Like you can hear that neither
of us are American here.

00:38:53.210 --> 00:38:55.030
We have teams all
over the world.

00:38:55.030 --> 00:38:56.900
And so I think
that actually helps

00:38:56.900 --> 00:38:58.620
in bringing a very
global perspective

00:38:58.620 --> 00:39:00.210
in building a product like this.

00:39:00.210 --> 00:39:02.470
That we're not all just
focused on one place.

00:39:02.470 --> 00:39:04.428
We've got people from
different point of views.

00:39:04.428 --> 00:39:05.070
That helps too.

00:39:05.070 --> 00:39:06.820
AUDIENCE: That was my
additional question.

00:39:06.820 --> 00:39:07.870
Sorry for interrupting.

00:39:07.870 --> 00:39:11.110
But I wanted to know how
localized the maps are.

00:39:11.110 --> 00:39:14.500
And how different they are
in Asian countries, or let's

00:39:14.500 --> 00:39:16.670
say in the Middle East.

00:39:16.670 --> 00:39:18.390
JONAH JONES: So
we try and achieve

00:39:18.390 --> 00:39:21.950
a balance between localization
where it makes sense,

00:39:21.950 --> 00:39:24.980
because we want people
to feel familiar.

00:39:24.980 --> 00:39:27.970
But we also want Google Maps
to be a consistent experience,

00:39:27.970 --> 00:39:30.190
so that you recognize
it as you travel around.

00:39:30.190 --> 00:39:33.000
So you'll see some
elements of the design,

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:37.010
like we have localized public
transit icons, for example.

00:39:37.010 --> 00:39:41.824
But the things like-- what else
was a good example-- things

00:39:41.824 --> 00:39:43.240
like restaurant
icons or something

00:39:43.240 --> 00:39:44.990
like that are kind of
the same everywhere.

00:39:44.990 --> 00:39:48.164
So we try and achieve a
balance of localization

00:39:48.164 --> 00:39:49.705
where it makes sense
to be different.

00:39:49.705 --> 00:39:52.440
But otherwise we try and
have a consistent style

00:39:52.440 --> 00:39:55.947
so that everyone can predict
how to use the product.

00:39:55.947 --> 00:39:57.530
ANNETTE LEONG: And
in terms of the UI,

00:39:57.530 --> 00:40:01.260
we also created
the framework that

00:40:01.260 --> 00:40:02.690
supports multiple languages.

00:40:02.690 --> 00:40:06.840
Like some language like you
have to read from right to left.

00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:09.810
So we had to make sure
that the framework could

00:40:09.810 --> 00:40:12.761
allow a format like that.

00:40:12.761 --> 00:40:14.760
AUDIENCE: I was wondering
if you could talk more

00:40:14.760 --> 00:40:17.801
about the differences between
the mobile app versus the web

00:40:17.801 --> 00:40:19.800
UI, which you were
showcasing more in this talk.

00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:23.204
In particular, I run a UX
design agency in our office.

00:40:23.204 --> 00:40:24.870
We were talking about
how much we really

00:40:24.870 --> 00:40:27.125
enjoy the updates
in the web app.

00:40:27.125 --> 00:40:29.080
And in the mobile
UI, we kept getting

00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:33.691
lost in how you even start
a navigation session.

00:40:33.691 --> 00:40:35.690
And it looked like
something's transferred well,

00:40:35.690 --> 00:40:36.460
and other things didn't.

00:40:36.460 --> 00:40:37.650
And maybe somethings
you're working on.

00:40:37.650 --> 00:40:40.430
So I was just wondering if you
could shed more light on that.

00:40:40.430 --> 00:40:42.370
JONAH JONES: I would
characterize that

00:40:42.370 --> 00:40:46.150
as saying that we have
this vision of the future.

00:40:46.150 --> 00:40:48.060
And then the mobile and
the desktop versions

00:40:48.060 --> 00:40:49.830
were being developed
concurrently.

00:40:49.830 --> 00:40:52.610
And so they're almost
like slightly different

00:40:52.610 --> 00:40:54.940
interpretations of
that same future.

00:40:54.940 --> 00:40:58.099
So the teams are sitting
right next to each other.

00:40:58.099 --> 00:40:59.765
So the desktop team
were borrowing ideas

00:40:59.765 --> 00:41:01.860
from the mobile
team and vice versa.

00:41:01.860 --> 00:41:04.010
So it's mostly the same.

00:41:04.010 --> 00:41:06.260
There are some things that
are deliberately different.

00:41:06.260 --> 00:41:08.060
There are a few things that
are kind of unintentionally

00:41:08.060 --> 00:41:09.380
different, that we want to fix.

00:41:09.380 --> 00:41:10.530
But I think gradually
you're going

00:41:10.530 --> 00:41:12.363
to see these things
converging increasingly.

00:41:12.363 --> 00:41:15.910
And especially with the
new material design staff.

00:41:15.910 --> 00:41:19.070
We really want to have
an experience where

00:41:19.070 --> 00:41:22.720
it's very, very consistent as
you go from desktop to tablet

00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:25.290
to mobile to watch
to Glass, whatever.

00:41:29.190 --> 00:41:32.789
AUDIENCE: So for new features
like highlighting roads

00:41:32.789 --> 00:41:34.330
next to points of
interest, are there

00:41:34.330 --> 00:41:36.730
any plans to make those
accessible via the API

00:41:36.730 --> 00:41:39.499
or any of the new features that
you guys talked about today?

00:41:39.499 --> 00:41:41.290
JONAH JONES: That's a
really good question.

00:41:41.290 --> 00:41:44.150
They do show up
on the API embed.

00:41:44.150 --> 00:41:45.460
Follow up with us afterwards.

00:41:45.460 --> 00:41:50.170
We've got the API guy here so
we can find out more about that.

00:41:50.170 --> 00:41:51.360
I believe that's everything.

00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:52.869
So thanks everyone
for your time.

00:41:52.869 --> 00:41:53.910
ANNETTE LEONG: Thank you.

00:41:53.910 --> 00:41:56.960
