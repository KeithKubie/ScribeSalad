00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.610
A few announcements at the beginning
today. This is 3.

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:29.220
91. For those of you who are new to
the class, welcome.

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.840
A couple of administrative things.
When you joined 3.091, regardless

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.460
of what registration took place
outside, please check in with my

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.070
office. I want you to check in with
either Hillary or Lori who will

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.690
assign you to a lecture section.
There is a lecture now Monday,

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.760
Wednesday and Friday at 11:00.
There is also a lecture Monday,

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.290
Wednesday and Friday at 1:00. And
we are trying to level out the

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:58.820
populations so that they balance the
seating capacity.

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.350
And also, likewise with the
recitations. We have recitations

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.880
that run all day long Tuesdays and
Thursdays. The earliest one is at

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.410
9:00, the latest one is at 4:00.
And, again, we are trying to

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:12.940
balance the occupancy there so that
we have good access to the

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.470
recitation instructor.
So please don't go squatting.

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:35.606
We need to know what the
populations are.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:24.620
And that office is just down the
hall here in 8-201.

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:29.240
There it is. They are supposed to
take that light out,

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.870
but maybe by the end of the semester
a miracle will occur.

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:38.490
So why don't you look over here.
There is the coordinates 8-201.

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.120
And talk to Lori or Hillary.
There will be a test on Tuesday

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:47.740
based on homework one; ten minutes
at the beginning of the recitation.

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.370
You are allowed to use on the test
the official version of the Periodic

00:01:52.370 --> 00:02:11.606
Table of the Elements which most of
you should have by now.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:02:00.830
There was a shipment that came in
partway through the day on Thursday.

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.660
If you didn't get a Periodic Table,
swing by the office.

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:08.490
It is just down the hall from this
lecture theater.

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:12.330
And you bring the Periodic Table
and the Table of Constants and a

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.160
calculator and something to write
with. That's four items.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:36.853
Show up, sit down, and the first
question is does anybody have a pen?

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:23.870
We may not have that many pens.
So those are the four items. You

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.740
do not use an aid sheet on the
weekly test. Aid sheet is for the

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:31.620
monthly tests,
not for the weeklies.

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.490
I have asked all of my recitation
instructors to state office hours.

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:39.370
And I, too, will have office hours.
So if you want to come and see me

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.240
Monday 3:30 to 4:30,
I am just down the hall.

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:47.120
Come in and see me. If you can't
come by at that hour,

00:02:47.120 --> 00:03:07.106
you can send me email and I will be
happy to meet with you.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:54.370
And I mean that.
I get to meet a lot of people

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.740
through the course of teaching,
and I recognize a lot of faces. I

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:01.120
can't say I will remember
everybody's name,

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.490
but I will recognize you.
And the same thing with the office

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:07.870
hours for the TAs.
The office hours are a time when

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.240
they will be seated waiting for
visitors. That means they will not

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:14.620
look at their email,
they will not take telephone calls.

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:34.373
They will be sitting there waiting
for visitors.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
If you cannot make the office hours,
again, contact the recitation

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
instructor to make other
arrangements. Yes?

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
STUDENT: Is there a limit to the
type of calculator one can

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:28.780
use during the test?
No, I don't care.

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.350
The question is there a limit to
the kind of calculator?

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:35.920
I don't care. You can bring a
mainframe in on a truck.

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.490
I don't care. [LAUGHTER] It
doesn't matter.

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:43.070
A big calculator,
you know, I am holding you on your

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:46.640
honor. I am assuming you haven't
loaded the Encyclopedia Britannica

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:50.210
into the memory.
It is a calculator,

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:54.150
so aid in computational efforts.
What else do I have to tell you?

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.460
The readings. Well, here is the
homework. This is what it is based

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:02.760
upon. And we were issuing those.
When you go to sign into the class

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.070
you will get a copy of this.
Some people asked me, if they

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:11.380
bought the earlier version of the
text, you can find the translation

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:15.690
to the earlier version of the text
on these question numbers.

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:35.513
And if you go to the website and
look down here, Fall Term '02.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
Go to Fall Term '02 and those
homeworks are listed bilingually.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
Last year I listed them, and there
were not that many people that had

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000
the First Edition of the text.
But if you have the first edition

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000
of the text, go to Fall Term '02 and
it will show you the earlier

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000
translations. In preparation for
lectures, I urge you to do some

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000
reading. And so up here you look at
lecture topics.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000
It is the second button down.
And you will get to a page that

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:51.640
looks like this.
And so, for today,

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:54.940
for example, it says Classification
Schemes, Mendeleev,

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:58.230
Atomic Structure, Readings Chapter 1,
Chapter 2, Appendix A.

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:01.520
I don't cover everything in there,
but you are not in high school

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:04.820
anymore. You are going to read,
you are going to learn, you are

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:08.110
going to come to lecture,
I am going to hit some high points,

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:11.410
things that I find particularly
interesting, but it is not sort of

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:14.700
well, he said we are going to read
this but then he didn't talk about

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:34.133
it in class. Well, get
over it. [LAUGHTER]

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:21.750
Now, when you starting looking for
next week, you are going to see

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:41.266
reference to a chapter,
which is in the core text,

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:29.250
and you will also see this LN,
LN, LN archives. These are archived

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:48.766
lecture notes that were written by
my predecessor,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:36.750
Professor Witt. And if you go back
to here and click on Archive Notes,

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:57.266
it is the fourth button down that
will take you to something that

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:44.250
looks like this.
And then if you look at Archive

00:05:44.250 --> 00:06:03.300
Notes number one this
is what you will see.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:52.120
In some instances,
these notes are superior to the text.

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:56.240
There is a reason for it.
3.091 has a syllabus that is unlike

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:00.370
general chemistry taught anywhere
else on the planet.

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:04.490
That is why you paid so much money
to come here. You didn't pay money

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:08.620
to come here to take something that
you could get just anywhere.

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:12.740
That is the good news. The bad
news is there isn't a text that fits

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:16.870
this syllabus,
so we choose readings from various

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:37.073
sources. And the text that I have
chosen is the best of a bad lot.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.000
It at least overlaps to a greater
extent than most of the other books.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000
And using the text plus these
archive notes,

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000
I think you will be able to piece
together what you need.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000
And there is a third alternative.
I don't know if you know this.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000
Maybe on the campus tour they kept
you away from this part of the

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.000
campus, but if you go over to the
east close to the river there is a

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000
building called "the library."
And you know what they have in the

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000
library? They have books.
And if you go into the library you

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000
could find books on topics that we
are discussing here,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.000
and you could read on your own.
But I wouldn't dare suggest

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.000
anything so radical.
Oh, by the way, speaking of text.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.000
My office got a call from the
purveyors of text,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000
Quantum and The Coop.
And I don't work for them,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000
and this purely a courtesy so that
they will know what

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:21.060
inventory to keep.
Could I have a show of hands of

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:25.190
people who are planning to buy the
text but haven't done so yet?

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:29.330
Would one of the TAs count, because
I don't want to.

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:33.460
Just hold your hands up.
I am going to keep talking.

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:37.590
We just want to get a rough idea so
we can tell me they need to have

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:41.730
another 20 or they need to have
another 100. Two significant digits

00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:45.860
is good enough.
We don't need to know.

00:07:45.860 --> 00:08:04.986
I think that is everything that I
wanted to cover.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:53.750
Oh, yes. And,
of course, the Webcast is available

00:07:53.750 --> 00:08:14.466
so that if you miss something during
lecture, or if you miss lecture

00:07:37.500 --> 00:08:01.250
altogether you can go to the website,
click on Webcast and follow what

00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:20.966
happened in lecture.
Let's see. Let's get on with the

00:07:45.000 --> 00:08:08.750
lesson. Last day we started talking
about taxonomy and looked at

00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:29.133
classification schemes starting with
Democritus, which was very

00:07:52.500 --> 00:08:16.250
forward-looking,
and then the backtracking of

00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:35.233
Aristotle. And I would
like to go further.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:23.750
We started with just the seven
metals and carbon plus sulfur,

00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:44.333
it was the point of departure for
Democritus. And the Aristotelian

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:31.250
view held for a long time,
but eventually it started to crumble

00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:51.300
in the light of more data.
And, again, all of these slides

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:38.750
that I am showing all convert to PDF
and will be posted at the website.

00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:59.400
So you can just watch, take notes,
but you don't have to copy every

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:46.250
last detail down.
By the time of the American

00:08:46.250 --> 00:09:05.766
Revolution these are the elements
that were known.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:54.280
And here we have arsenic,
antimony, and bismuth, three

00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:58.570
delightful that were given us in the
12th, 13th and 14th centuries by the

00:08:58.570 --> 00:09:02.850
alchemists. In 13th century India,
they knew how to isolate metallic

00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:07.140
zinc. In fact,
there is a pillar there of high

00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:11.420
purity zinc that stood for the
duration. It is almost a thousand

00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:15.710
years now and it is in high purity.
Platinum was unknown until the

00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:34.420
Spanish came to South America.
It was unknown.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:23.860
It is an American metal.
Platinum is an American metal.

00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:27.730
And, oddly enough, it was given a
bad name. Plata is silver.

00:09:27.730 --> 00:09:31.590
So platina is like a diminutive of
silver, but we now know that

00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:35.460
platinum is far superior to silver.
It is far more noble. It has a

00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:39.330
higher melting point,
a higher chemical inertness,

00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:43.190
a fantastic metal. An American
metal. And then all of a sudden we

00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:47.060
have discover,
discover, discover,

00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:51.130
discover. What does this mean?
Are we saying that until 1774 there

00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:55.390
was no oxygen because it was
discovered then?

00:09:55.390 --> 00:09:59.660
No. What does it mean?
It means that it was isolated and

00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:03.930
characterized.
Lavoisier characterized oxygen.

00:10:03.930 --> 00:10:08.190
Cavendish characterized hydrogen.
And so now we see the shift from

00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:12.460
craft to science.
Now we have all this data,

00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:16.730
and this Aristotelian model is
looking goofier and goofier.

00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:35.260
So we need to have some better
explanation.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:25.760
And one of the earliest was that of
John Dalton. John Dalton was an

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:30.530
Englishman who proposed the
following classification of the

00:10:30.530 --> 00:10:35.300
elements. John Dalton's science was
very accurately weighing the

00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:40.070
elements. He has arranged the
elements here in a column.

00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:44.840
It is a double column, but it is
only made double for convenience.

00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:49.610
You can see, it starts with
hydrogen and goes to mercury in

00:10:49.610 --> 00:10:53.750
ascending order of atomic mass.
And he was very proficient at

00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:57.250
measuring atomic mass.
And, furthermore, he started to

00:10:57.250 --> 00:11:00.750
abbreviate. Instead of writing gold
he made this symbol.

00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:04.250
Silver was S with a circle.
He could have worked on a ranch out

00:11:04.250 --> 00:11:07.750
in the West, couldn't he?
This looks like branding things,

00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:11.250
don't they? Well, this is
interesting, cute fonts,

00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:14.750
but in point of fact they were
short-lived. Berzelius,

00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:18.250
the Swedish chemist suggested that
the French might take umbrage at

00:11:18.250 --> 00:11:21.770
having to use I for iron.
He said why don't we choose

00:11:21.770 --> 00:11:25.330
something neutral?
Let's choose Latin,

00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:28.880
the language of scholarship,
and so iron became Fe for ferrum and

00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:32.440
lead became Pb for plumbum and gold
is Au for aurum and so on.

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:35.990
And nobody quibbles because nobody
speaks Latin so it is neutral for

00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:39.550
everybody. John Dalton also talked
about other things.

00:11:39.550 --> 00:11:43.100
He said I am going to propose a
model. And this is right out of

00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:46.660
Chapter 1 of the text,
1803. These are the planks of his

00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:50.220
model, that matter is composed of
atoms that are indivisible

00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:53.680
and indestructible.
Well, doesn't that sound an awful

00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:57.060
lot like Democritus?
He is taking us back.

00:11:57.060 --> 00:12:00.430
He is getting us out of that
Aristotelian rut and moving us back

00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:03.800
to something that makes more sense.
All atoms of an element are

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:07.180
identical, that's good.
Atoms of different elements have

00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:10.550
different weights and different
chemical properties.

00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:13.930
This is important. The word
"property" is really important - to

00:12:13.930 --> 00:12:17.310
connect the concept of property with
something fundamental in the make-up,

00:12:17.310 --> 00:12:20.630
in the constitution.
What I am doing,

00:12:20.630 --> 00:12:23.890
listen to me, I'm talking at two
levels here. I am talking at the

00:12:23.890 --> 00:12:27.150
level of this is Dalton's model,
but then there is a meta knowledge

00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:30.410
here of how you develop models in
general. If you are trying to model,

00:12:30.410 --> 00:12:33.670
I don't know, the efficacy of a
particular drug,

00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:36.940
these are the baby-steps that you
will go through.

00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:40.200
Atoms of different elements combine
in simple whole number ratios to

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:43.470
form compounds.
That is important,

00:12:43.470 --> 00:12:46.730
that elements, because they are the
building blocks,

00:12:46.730 --> 00:13:05.993
they combine in whole number
multiples.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
If you have a set of blocks,
mechanical, physical blocks, and I

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
tell you to build something and I
say, oh, by the way,

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
you have to cut the blocks in
smaller pieces,

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
you are going to get angry,
aren't you? You are going to say,

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
well, I thought these were the
blocks. These are the basic blocks

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
so, therefore,
whole number ratios is a consequence

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
of that. And,
lastly, this is Democritus that the

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
being is made of particles that are
eternal. This is eternity here.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
Atoms cannot be created or
destroyed. And when a compound is

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
decomposed, the atoms are
recovered unchanged.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:23.860
This is good stuff.
It was 200 years ago.

00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:27.730
Just last fall there were some
events in the world celebrating the

00:13:27.730 --> 00:13:31.590
bicentennial of Dalton's scientific
achievements. Oh,

00:13:31.590 --> 00:13:35.460
by the way, just to let you know,
these scientists of that era were

00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:39.330
polymaths. They were not
specialists. I am a specialist of

00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:43.190
atoms that are left-handed on
Thursday afternoons,

00:13:43.190 --> 00:13:47.060
and don't talk to me about anything
else. These people had broad

00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:50.820
scientific interests.
Dalton did a lot of work on vision.

00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:54.460
He, like many men, was afflicted
with red-green colorblindness.

00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:58.110
And he developed the understanding
of red-green colorblindness,

00:13:58.110 --> 00:14:01.760
and it is known as Daltonism.
The same man. Other

00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:05.400
classifications,
Dobereiner at Jena talked about

00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:09.050
triads. People,
remember, they were measuring atomic

00:14:09.050 --> 00:14:12.700
masses. He saw that if you take the
atomic mass of chlorine,

00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:16.350
add it to the atomic mass of iodine,
divide by two, you get something

00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:36.033
that is really close to the atomic
mass of bromine.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:23.640
And he did it for other triads.
And he found that the middle member

00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:27.290
of the triad had an atomic mass that
was midway between the atomic masses

00:14:27.290 --> 00:14:30.930
of the end members.
An attempt. You have to give him

00:14:30.930 --> 00:14:34.580
credit. Second was Newlands that I
will talk about.

00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:38.230
I like Newlands because he had a
musical flair about him.

00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:41.870
He talked about octaves.
He said look at sodium, magnesium,

00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:45.520
aluminum, silicon, phosphorus,
sulfur, chlorine,

00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:49.170
potassium. One, two,
three, four, five, six,

00:14:49.170 --> 00:14:53.250
seven, eight.
Potassium lies one octave from

00:14:53.250 --> 00:14:57.750
sodium. He talked about octaves.
When he presented his results at

00:14:57.750 --> 00:15:02.250
the sitting of the Royal Society,
he was ridiculed. He was laughed at.

00:15:02.250 --> 00:15:06.750
He was derided.
Somebody rose and asked him if he

00:15:06.750 --> 00:15:11.250
had considered putting the elements
in alphabetical order.

00:15:11.250 --> 00:15:15.750
They were very cruel. These people
were nasty. They don't

00:15:15.750 --> 00:15:20.350
welcome innovation.
Science is very hostile to

00:15:20.350 --> 00:15:25.070
innovation when it challenges
existing theory,

00:15:25.070 --> 00:15:29.780
sort of like management,
the same thing. Let's move onto

00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:34.490
something that really took the giant
step ahead, and that was Mendeleev.

00:15:34.490 --> 00:15:39.210
And I also want to mention Lothar
Meyer in Tubingen who came up with

00:15:39.210 --> 00:15:43.920
the same classification scheme,
but we are going to see in a moment

00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:48.640
why Meyer is not well celebrated
today and the glory to

00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:52.900
goes to Mendeleev.
1869, Mendeleev,

00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:56.720
here is a picture of him taken from
that period. He was 35 years old at

00:15:56.720 --> 00:16:00.540
the time he enunciated this.
35, positively brilliant. Here is

00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:04.360
his paper. It was published in The
Journal of Russian Chemical Society,

00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:08.180
1869. And it is really great
because he actually goes through the

00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:26.960
thought process for you
and describes --

00:15:52.000 --> 00:16:16.370
I need to give you one piece of
background. Mendeleev played cards.

00:16:16.370 --> 00:16:20.740
And he traveled by train. And so
to pass the time,

00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:25.120
he would play solitaire.
He was used to working with cards

00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:29.490
and putting things in rows and
columns by suit.

00:16:29.490 --> 00:16:33.870
You had to find what is the
distinguishing feature?

00:16:33.870 --> 00:16:38.240
Well, these are all clubs,
these are all spades and these are

00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:42.620
all hearts. And I get down to a
certain card and I am stumped,

00:16:42.620 --> 00:17:02.373
so I will leave a space waiting for
that card to appear on cue.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:50.640
That is the background.
Here he is. He has all the

00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:54.290
information he knows that has been
reported on the various elements on

00:16:54.290 --> 00:16:57.930
file cards. He even carried them
around in his pocket and he would

00:16:57.930 --> 00:17:01.580
look at them from time to time and
try to devise a scheme.

00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:05.230
Remember the other people,
the octaves had been enunciated,

00:17:05.230 --> 00:17:08.870
the triads had been enunciated.
Here he is in his paper and says at

00:17:08.870 --> 00:17:12.520
that time I decided that it was
advantageous to find a more general

00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:16.170
system of the elements and here is
my attempt. And here he

00:17:16.170 --> 00:17:20.660
has laid them all out.
And he has left blanks here,

00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:25.990
question marks here and says it is
advantageous to put them in rows and

00:17:25.990 --> 00:17:31.330
to form a table.
And here is the smoking gun

00:17:31.330 --> 00:17:36.660
sentence right here.
It says finally it came to place,

00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:41.990
according to this concocted system,
and I've underlined in red, very

00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:47.330
many undiscovered members.
So what does he do? He knows that

00:17:47.330 --> 00:17:52.460
he shouldn't put arsenic under --
He shouldn't put arsenic under

00:17:52.460 --> 00:17:57.380
aluminum. Arsenic is nothing like
aluminum. Arsenic is like

00:17:57.380 --> 00:18:02.300
phosphorus. He takes those two
facts, plus the courage to leave

00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:07.220
blanks, and this is what he gives us.
Lothar Meyer was doing the same

00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:12.150
thing, but Mendeleev does something
more. He says not only does arsenic

00:18:12.150 --> 00:18:17.070
belong under phosphorus,
I predict that there is an element

00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:34.873
that lies below aluminum
and above indium.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:26.300
And I will go even further and will
predict what its atomic mass is.

00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:30.610
So he called them eka. Eka comes
from Sanskrit meaning one after.

00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:34.920
So eka-aluminum is one after
aluminum. He predicted 68 for the

00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:39.230
atomic mass. Gallium was
subsequently isolated 69.

00:18:39.230 --> 00:18:43.530
. Eka-silicon, which we now know to
be germanium, 72,

00:18:43.530 --> 00:18:47.840
72.6. He says there is an element
under zirconium, and it

00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:51.770
should be about 180.
He said there should be an element

00:18:51.770 --> 00:18:55.330
under boron. He called it eka-boron,
scandium 45, 45.

00:18:55.330 --> 00:18:58.880
. It gets better.
He goes into excruciating detail.

00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:02.440
This is his prediction for silicon.
I already showed you the atomic

00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:05.990
mass. He said I predict its density
5.5. It was measured 5.

00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:09.550
6. He says it will have a high
melting point.

00:19:09.550 --> 00:19:13.110
Well, that is arbitrary.
It melts at 958. It forms a

00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:16.660
dioxide, has a high melting point.
And he predicts the density of the

00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:20.220
oxide of the yet undiscovered
element. And he gets it right to

00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:23.920
two significant figures.
And then he says the tetrachloride

00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:27.780
will be volatile,
and it will have a density of 1.

00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:31.640
. And subsequently germanium
tetrachloride was synthesized and

00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:35.490
measured to be 1.
8. That is why we celebrate

00:19:35.490 --> 00:19:39.350
Mendeleev. What we are seeing here
is a big transition from just

00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:43.210
experiment and documentation to
modern chemistry.

00:19:43.210 --> 00:19:47.070
And how does modern chemistry work?
Well, first of all, look at the

00:19:47.070 --> 00:19:50.880
data.
We always have to look around us and

00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:54.640
account for all the evidence.
And this is an ethical question,

00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:58.410
people. Sometimes you get data that
throw you off.

00:19:58.410 --> 00:20:02.170
And it is so easy to dismiss those
data. What you have to do is have

00:20:02.170 --> 00:20:05.930
the courage to say I have got to
account for the bad data,

00:20:05.930 --> 00:20:09.700
what I think are bad data and the
data that helped me build my theory.

00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:13.460
So you recognize patterns and then
develop a model,

00:20:13.460 --> 00:20:17.230
and most desirably a quantitative
model. A quantitative model that

00:20:17.230 --> 00:20:35.860
explains the observations,
obviously.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:25.140
But what Mendeleev did was he came
up with a model that not only

00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:29.280
explained what we observed.
It made prediction. And it made

00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:33.420
predictions that can be tested.
I would love to make predictions

00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:37.560
that you cannot test.
Well, let's make predictions that

00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:41.710
can be put to the test.
So this is modern chemistry.

00:20:41.710 --> 00:20:45.850
I have told you about the table of
the elements. Why do we call it the

00:20:45.850 --> 00:21:05.033
Periodic Table?
We'll again go back to the website.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:54.920
Down here is a button called
Courseware. If you click on

00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:59.840
Courseware you will get to this menu,
the first of which preferences is

00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:04.760
Periodic Table.
If you click on Periodic Table,

00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:09.690
you can get a variety of choices.
One of them here I happened to

00:21:09.690 --> 00:21:14.610
choose is boiling point versus
atomic number.

00:21:14.610 --> 00:21:19.530
Mendeleev is the one who taught us
that the properties of the elements

00:21:19.530 --> 00:21:24.330
are a function of the atomic mass.
So let's get that down.

00:21:24.330 --> 00:21:28.990
By the way, the Cyrillic to Latin
translation has not been agreed upon,

00:21:28.990 --> 00:21:33.660
so you will see Mendeleev's name
spelled many different ways.

00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:38.330
You will see it spelled like this.
You will see it spelled like this,

00:21:38.330 --> 00:21:42.990
like this and so on.
And so, when you do a search,

00:21:42.990 --> 00:21:47.660
it is sometimes frustrating. But I
will use various forms.

00:21:47.660 --> 00:21:54.280
Mendeleev wrote the following.
He says that the properties of the

00:21:54.280 --> 00:22:02.850
elements are, or let's say vary,
the properties of the elements vary

00:22:02.850 --> 00:22:11.420
periodically with atomic mass.
We will find out later that is

00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:26.173
almost correct.
There is a slight variant on there.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:23.520
But right now I am going to give it
to you as Mendeleev enunciated it.

00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:27.050
Atomic number, we will learn later,
is the improvement. That is why

00:22:27.050 --> 00:22:30.580
this says atomic number,
but for most intents and purposes we

00:22:30.580 --> 00:22:34.110
can say this could be atomic mass.
What I am looking at here is

00:22:34.110 --> 00:22:37.640
boiling point as a function of
atomic number.

00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:41.170
And what we see is it is not
monotonic. It is not continuously

00:22:41.170 --> 00:22:44.700
rising, continuously falling.
It seems to rise and then fall.

00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:48.230
And then it rises and then it falls.
And then it rises

00:22:48.230 --> 00:22:52.060
and then it falls.
And it rises and then it falls.

00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:56.180
And, if you laid this out in a
table, as Mendeleev did with his

00:22:56.180 --> 00:23:00.310
cards, you would find that the local
maxima all occur roughly in the same

00:23:00.310 --> 00:23:04.430
horizontal position from the end
points of the rows.

00:23:04.430 --> 00:23:08.550
And then there is a trend going
from least massive to most massive.

00:23:08.550 --> 00:23:12.680
So that is where the "periodic"
comes from. We have a table of the

00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:16.810
elements with properties varying
periodically with atomic mass,

00:23:16.810 --> 00:23:20.930
so we compress all of that
information and refer to it

00:23:20.930 --> 00:23:24.710
as the Periodic Table.
Here is atomic radius versus atomic

00:23:24.710 --> 00:23:28.140
number. You see the radius is high
and then it falls.

00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:31.570
It rises, it falls.
It rises, it falls. It rises,

00:23:31.570 --> 00:23:34.990
it falls. We are going to now go
into the atom and try to understand

00:23:34.990 --> 00:23:38.420
the scientific basis for this
observed behavior.

00:23:38.420 --> 00:23:41.850
And so here is the Periodic Table
in its glory today following on

00:23:41.850 --> 00:23:45.280
Mendeleev's scheme.
The elements have been named up

00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:49.530
through --
The one that you are getting hasn't

00:23:49.530 --> 00:23:54.610
got the latest information.
This was named over the past summer.

00:23:54.610 --> 00:23:59.690
This is element 110 which has been
named darmstadtium after Darmstadt.

00:23:59.690 --> 00:24:04.760
And I will tell you why in a minute.
If you do look down at the Periodic

00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:09.840
Table and get above 109,
you will see these strange notations

00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:14.920
here, Uun, Uuu,
Uub. What is all of this?

00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:32.973
These are elements that have yet to
be isolated.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:10.000
These are elements that are unstable.
These are what are known as the

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:20.000
superheavies. Elements beyond
uranium, these are synthetic.

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:30.000
And where are they made? The
manufacturing facility.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:55.270
There are three places on the planet
that have the high energy physics

00:24:55.270 --> 00:25:00.540
equipment in order to make these,
and these are the three places. One

00:25:00.540 --> 00:25:05.810
is Dubna in the former Soviet Union
in Russia, one is in Darmstadt in

00:25:05.810 --> 00:25:11.080
Germany and the third one is in the
United States in Berkeley.

00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:16.360
These are the three places where
they have the accelerators.

00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:21.380
And the kinds of reactions --
Here is how they were able to make

00:25:21.380 --> 00:25:26.150
darmstadtium. They take an atom of
lead, accelerate it and have it

00:25:26.150 --> 00:25:30.920
collide with an atom of nickel.
And, if the conditions are right,

00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:35.690
they will combine, fuse and form
darmstadtium plus neutron.

00:25:35.690 --> 00:25:40.460
So these devices, when I was a
youngster, were colloquially known

00:25:40.460 --> 00:25:45.230
as "atom smashers",
because they have the capacity to

00:25:45.230 --> 00:26:03.193
actually break these and
have them reform.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:53.750
And there are various forces that
play in the nucleus that will

00:25:53.750 --> 00:26:13.533
dictate when this will be stable and
when it won't be.

00:25:37.500 --> 00:26:01.250
They isolated it,
but it decays very quickly on the

00:26:01.250 --> 00:26:20.566
order of microseconds.
Lifetime on the order of

00:25:45.000 --> 00:26:08.750
microseconds. So,
you can imagine, that is why we

00:26:08.750 --> 00:26:29.133
don't have the boiling point of
darmstadtium and its electrical

00:25:52.500 --> 00:26:16.250
conductivity. They have isolated it
enough that they can actually say

00:26:16.250 --> 00:26:35.166
the bare minimum about
it. So we have it.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:24.610
And then, just so that you will be
literate in the rest of the Periodic

00:26:24.610 --> 00:26:29.220
Table, if you look at the higher
ones, this is how you name them.

00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:33.840
Use these Latin prefixes. 111
would be un plus un plus un.

00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:38.460
So 115 is ununpentium. That is why
you see these Uup,

00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:43.070
Uun. My favorite is 111 because
that is unununium.

00:26:43.070 --> 00:26:47.690
I am going to be sad when they
finally get a name for

00:26:47.690 --> 00:26:52.140
it. There they are.
And, when they are named,

00:26:52.140 --> 00:26:56.420
they are named by suggestion by the
scientist who have isolated them.

00:26:56.420 --> 00:27:00.710
And there is a lot of competition.
Obviously, if it is Russian team

00:27:00.710 --> 00:27:04.990
that isolates the element,
they are going to advocate the name

00:27:04.990 --> 00:27:09.280
of a Russian scientist or a Russian
location or whatnot.

00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:13.570
Obviously, the work that was done
to isolate 110 was done in Germany

00:27:13.570 --> 00:27:17.850
and they proposed the name Darmstadt.
And, hence, it is named

00:27:17.850 --> 00:27:21.940
darmstadtium.
There is a dubnium and there is also

00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:25.820
a berkelium. And,
if you look in the very high numbers,

00:27:25.820 --> 00:27:29.700
you will see these nomenclatures.
There is darmstadtium sitting there.

00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:33.580
For reading, if you are really
curious about some of this early

00:27:33.580 --> 00:27:37.460
history, I can recommend this book.
It is "Mendeleev's Dream." I read

00:27:37.460 --> 00:27:41.350
it the summer before last.
It has a lot, of course, about

00:27:41.350 --> 00:27:45.230
Mendeleev. But what is really
interesting is the author assumes

00:27:45.230 --> 00:27:49.110
that the reader hasn't taken 3.
91. And so the first three chapters

00:27:49.110 --> 00:28:09.620
take you through the history of
chemistry starting with Democritus.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:57.150
And it takes you through to the
Aristotelian theory.

00:27:57.150 --> 00:28:01.300
After you have had these lectures,
it will be a joy to read. Now let's

00:28:01.300 --> 00:28:05.460
go inside the atom to try to
understand what is going on.

00:28:05.460 --> 00:28:09.610
And this is taken from your book,
Table 1.3. And so these are the

00:28:09.610 --> 00:28:13.760
subatomic particles that we have to
contend with. We have the electron.

00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:17.920
It bears a negative charge and the
value of minus 1.6 times

00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:36.640
10 to the 19 coulombs.
This is the SI unit,

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:06.000
the systeme international unit for
electric charge.

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:10.000
And it has a mass of 9.
1 times 10 to the minus 31 kilograms.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:14.000
The charge compensation comes out
of the nucleus with the proton and

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:18.000
it is positive 1.
times 10 to the minus 19 coulombs.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:22.000
But its mass is 1800 times that of
the electron. The electron is just

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:26.000
a little gnat in comparison to the
proton. And then there is this

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:30.000
third species, the neutron,
which has no charge.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:36.000
Roughly equal in mass to that of the
proton. And so what we do,

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:42.000
in order to designate the identity
of an atom, is the following.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:48.000
This is the atomic symbol which was
given by Berzelius.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:54.000
This is the Latin one or two letter
character. And we began with the

00:28:54.000 --> 00:29:00.000
proton number.
The proton number is in the lower

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:26.250
left corner. Z proton number.
Number of protons in the nucleus,

00:29:26.250 --> 00:29:32.750
this is number of protons in the
nucleus, which in the neutral atom

00:29:32.750 --> 00:29:47.900
is equal to the number of electrons.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:25.000
Now, to get to the number of
neutrons, what we do is go up here

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:30.000
to the upper left.
And this is called the atomic mass.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:54.280
And it is equal to the sum of the
number of protons plus the number of

00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:58.560
neutrons. So we get at the number
of neutrons indirectly because we

00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:02.850
know the proton number here.
This is sum of protons plus

00:30:02.850 --> 00:30:07.140
neutrons. And we don't put the mass
of the electrons because they are so

00:30:07.140 --> 00:30:11.420
light in comparison.
This will give us the sum that we

00:30:11.420 --> 00:30:15.710
need. And, at some level,
there is some redundancy here.

00:30:15.710 --> 00:30:35.020
If we want to write sodium, for
example, sodium 23, 11.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:25.090
Well, 11 means it is sodium.
If you have 11 protons, it must be

00:30:25.090 --> 00:30:30.180
sodium. We could get away with just
23 Sodium **23Na**,

00:30:30.180 --> 00:30:35.270
but if you wanted to be a real
smart-aleck you could write sodium

00:30:35.270 --> 00:30:40.360
like this. You don't need anything
here. Just a suggestion.

00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:45.450
Now, atoms need not be neutral.
They can be charge deficient or

00:30:45.450 --> 00:30:51.750
charge excessive.
And so Michael Faraday coined the

00:30:51.750 --> 00:30:59.250
term "ion" for atoms of net charge,
atoms and other species bearing net

00:30:59.250 --> 00:31:11.500
charge.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:31:14.400
For example, the positive ions,
these are electron deficient. We

00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:20.790
cannot do anything about protons,
they are buried in the nucleus, but

00:31:20.790 --> 00:31:26.790
we can add or subtract electrons.
The positive ions are electron

00:31:26.790 --> 00:31:32.390
deficient, and these are known as
cations. And you can use mnemonics

00:31:32.390 --> 00:31:37.990
to try to keep these straight.
I see the T as sort of a plus sign.

00:31:37.990 --> 00:31:43.590
It comes from the fact that in an
electrochemical cell,

00:31:43.590 --> 00:31:49.190
the cations are those that are
reduced. You know from catastrophe,

00:31:49.190 --> 00:31:54.540
cata is Greek for down.
Catastrophe is a downturn.

00:31:54.540 --> 00:31:59.630
So that is the cation. The
negative ions,

00:31:59.630 --> 00:32:04.720
these are electron-rich.
They have an excess of electrons.

00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:09.810
And these are known as anions. It
has the n, which might conjure up

00:32:09.810 --> 00:32:14.900
negative, or anion and minus both
have five letters.

00:32:14.900 --> 00:32:34.266
I don't know how you want to try to
keep those straight, but anyway.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:25.590
Those mnemonics sometimes come in
handy. All right.

00:32:25.590 --> 00:32:31.190
Now the last thing is that because
the neutron has no net charge,

00:32:31.190 --> 00:32:36.790
we can change neutron number.
Neutron has no charge.

00:32:36.790 --> 00:32:42.390
This means you can vary the neutron
number without changing chemical

00:32:42.390 --> 00:33:00.646
identity, because chemical identity
is fixed by the proton.

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:53.450
And since we don't have to charge
compensate, we can add or subtract

00:32:53.450 --> 00:32:58.900
neutrons at liberty.
And so you can look,

00:32:58.900 --> 00:33:04.360
for example, at the Periodic Table.
And, if you look up the atomic mass

00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:09.810
of carbon, you will see that carbon
comes at 12.011 for carbon.

00:33:09.810 --> 00:33:15.270
Well, isn't this against Dalton?
This thing is supposed to be a

00:33:15.270 --> 00:33:33.873
whole number here.
But, if you look more carefully,

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:04.000
you will find that this is a blend
of three different forms of carbon.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:08.000
We have carbon 12. I will even
leave off the 6 because we already

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:12.000
know it is carbon.
It has to have 6 protons.

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:16.000
So carbon 12. We know that it has
the proton number,

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:20.000
by definition, is 6.
And the neutron number,

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:24.000
6 from 12 is 6. So it has 6 protons
and 6 neutrons.

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:28.000
And it is the dominant form of
carbon.

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:53.810
So its abundance in nature is 98.
92%. There is a carbon 13, however.

00:33:53.810 --> 00:33:59.630
It axiomatically must be 6 protons,
and it has 7 neutrons.

00:33:59.630 --> 00:34:05.450
And this found in an abundance of
about 1.108%. And then there are

00:34:05.450 --> 00:34:11.270
the last four,
carbon 14, which is a radioactive

00:34:11.270 --> 00:34:17.090
form. And we will talk about that
later in 3.091.

00:34:17.090 --> 00:34:23.090
And its use in radiocarbon dating.
And carbon 14,

00:34:23.090 --> 00:34:29.270
6 again and it has 8,
and it is found in vanishingly small

00:34:29.270 --> 00:34:35.450
amounts, 10 to the minus 12 or part
per trillion. If you add all these

00:34:35.450 --> 00:34:41.630
up then you end up with 12.
11 as the atomic mass. They all

00:34:41.630 --> 00:34:47.810
have the same Z,
the same proton number,

00:34:47.810 --> 00:35:05.220
but different A, which means number
of neutrons varies.

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:59.190
That means they are found on the
same place on the Periodic Table.

00:34:59.190 --> 00:35:04.390
If they are found on the same place,
it is iso-topos.

00:35:04.390 --> 00:35:09.590
These are called isotopes.
Isotopes have the same chemical

00:35:09.590 --> 00:35:14.790
identity but different nuclear
properties. What are the units here?

00:35:14.790 --> 00:35:32.513
We write 12.011. It is
either grams per mole.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:26.660
And I am not making a mistake here.
Most of chemistry has gone SI so

00:35:26.660 --> 00:35:33.330
every mass should be in kilograms.
But occasionally there is this one

00:35:33.330 --> 00:35:39.990
little remnant of the old CGS system,
centimeters-gram-second,

00:35:39.990 --> 00:35:46.660
and this is one. This is 12.
11 grams per mole or 12.011 atomic

00:35:46.660 --> 00:35:54.280
mass units, AMU.
And the AMU is defined as the mass

00:35:54.280 --> 00:36:02.850
of one-twelfth of a carbon 12 atom.
I talked about this concept of mole

00:36:02.850 --> 00:36:11.420
here. What is the mole?
Mole is a more practical value,

00:36:11.420 --> 00:36:25.306
something that we can handle
tangibly.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:28.570
And how do we get the value of the
mole? The mole is something that

00:36:28.570 --> 00:36:37.140
was also defined in terms of carbon.
And the mole is defined as the mass

00:36:37.140 --> 00:36:45.710
of, excuse me.
It is the amount of carbon 12

00:36:45.710 --> 00:36:52.580
weighing exactly 12.000 grams.
You can see the atomic mass unit

00:36:52.580 --> 00:36:57.740
will be, excuse me.
Let me go at it a different way.

00:36:57.740 --> 00:37:02.910
This will be the definition of the
mole as the amount of carbon

00:37:02.910 --> 00:37:08.080
weighing exactly 12 grams,
so I would like to know now how many

00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:13.240
particles, how many carbons are
there in that mole.

00:37:13.240 --> 00:37:18.410
And one way we can get to that is
by looking at two pieces of data.

00:37:18.410 --> 00:37:24.220
The first one, again, is by Faraday.
Faraday conducted electrolysis of

00:37:24.220 --> 00:37:30.660
silver. In an aqueous solution,
he passes electric current and

00:37:30.660 --> 00:37:37.110
causes silver ions to deposit and
form metallic silver.

00:37:37.110 --> 00:37:43.550
And he measures how much charge is
required. He has current.

00:37:43.550 --> 00:38:01.766
We know that charge is equal to the
integral of current times the time.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:35.000
And he knows the current,
he knows how much time and then he

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:40.000
weighs this. So he is able to
weighthe silver and compare it to

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:45.000
carbon. And, against that scale,
he finds the silver weighs 107 grams

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:50.000
versus 12 grams for carbon.
That is the ratio. Now, if he only

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:55.000
knew what the electron brought him
he would be able to divide through

00:37:55.000 --> 00:38:00.000
and calculate how many species there
are in a mole.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:06.000
And, in order to determine that,
we had to wait a few years until

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:12.000
1909. In 1909 Robert Millikan doing
experiments at the University of

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:18.000
Chicago conducted this interesting
effort where he took atomizer,

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:24.000
filled it with oil and then squirted
fine droplets of oil mist in between

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:30.000
two plates that could be
electrically charged.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:54.900
He further charged the droplets by
irradiating. Here it is showing

00:38:54.900 --> 00:38:59.810
x-rays. He used x-rays.
He used various forms of

00:38:59.810 --> 00:39:04.720
high-energy radiation in order to
make the droplets bear a charge.

00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:09.630
Now you have this situation where
you have a droplet that is net

00:39:09.630 --> 00:39:14.540
negative or perhaps net positive.
And it lies suspended between two

00:39:14.540 --> 00:39:19.190
plates.
And I am able to vary the voltage on

00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:23.590
the plates making this for
argument's sake negative and this

00:39:23.590 --> 00:39:27.990
for argument's sake positive.
If there is no charge on the plate,

00:39:27.990 --> 00:39:32.390
these droplets will simply fall
under gravity.

00:39:32.390 --> 00:39:36.790
Once the droplets are charged it
makes no difference.

00:39:36.790 --> 00:39:41.190
They will fall regardless of the
charge. When the charge is applied,

00:39:41.190 --> 00:39:45.590
if the upper plate is negative, we
would expect that the negative

00:39:45.590 --> 00:40:05.713
droplet would be repelled at a rate
exceeding the gravitational fall.

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:54.830
The positive droplet,
its fall will be slowed and could

00:39:54.830 --> 00:39:59.660
even be made to lift.
And so, by playing with a variety

00:39:59.660 --> 00:40:04.490
of sizes, remember the atomizer is
going to give a distribution of

00:40:04.490 --> 00:40:09.330
droplet sizes,
a distribution of voltages,

00:40:09.330 --> 00:40:14.160
Millikan was able to develop a
relationship between the applied

00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:32.653
charge and the observed velocities
of the droplets.

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:24.160
Let's plot droplet velocity as a
function of looking at the number

00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:29.330
that have this velocity with the
zero being in the center here.

00:40:29.330 --> 00:40:34.490
What do you expect is going to
happen? If there were no voltage on

00:40:34.490 --> 00:40:39.660
the plates, we would expect
everything to be over here in some

00:40:39.660 --> 00:40:44.830
negative value falling.
But what he found was a

00:40:44.830 --> 00:41:02.126
distribution. He found
a distribution.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:54.660
And, if you look more closely at the
distribution, here is what he found.

00:40:54.660 --> 00:40:59.330
He found that some droplets had a
certain velocity,

00:40:59.330 --> 00:41:03.990
and then others had a velocity plus
some step. And he couldn't get

00:41:03.990 --> 00:41:08.660
values of velocity in between
certain steps.

00:41:08.660 --> 00:41:13.330
He reasoned then that the charge,
since he could vary voltage

00:41:13.330 --> 00:41:17.990
continuously but got a discontinuous
variation in velocity,

00:41:17.990 --> 00:41:22.660
his conclusion was that the charge
must be discontinuously attached

00:41:22.660 --> 00:41:28.120
to the droplet.
Out of that he concludes charge must

00:41:28.120 --> 00:41:34.370
be quantized. Charge is quantized.
In other words, it comes in batches

00:41:34.370 --> 00:41:40.620
of a certain unit.
Charge is quantized.

00:41:40.620 --> 00:41:46.870
And, secondly, he was able to
measure the value of the

00:41:46.870 --> 00:41:52.260
elemental charge.
We use the term element to mean the

00:41:52.260 --> 00:41:56.790
lowest value. The element is carbon.
That is the smallest unit.

00:41:56.790 --> 00:42:01.330
Chemically this is the smallest
unit of charge.

00:42:01.330 --> 00:42:05.860
And he gave us a value that turns
out to be 1.6 times 10 to the minus

00:42:05.860 --> 00:42:10.390
19 coulombs in modern times.
And the electron has a negative

00:42:10.390 --> 00:42:14.930
charge, so we would say the charge
on the electron is minus 1.

00:42:14.930 --> 00:42:19.460
. But I want you to learn this as e
being the elementary charge.

00:42:19.460 --> 00:42:38.586
E is the finest charge that is
available to be attached.

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:30.600
And so now if we take the value of
the Faraday, Faraday found that to

00:42:30.600 --> 00:42:37.200
get 107 grams of silver required 96,
85 coulombs. This is on the basis

00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:43.800
of the integral of the current times
the time. And Millikan said that e

00:42:43.800 --> 00:42:50.400
is equal to 1.
times 10 to the minus 19 coulombs.

00:42:50.400 --> 00:43:07.600
This is coulombs per charge and
this is coulombs per mole.

00:42:37.000 --> 00:43:02.330
If you divide the two of them
through you will get 6.

00:43:02.330 --> 00:43:07.660
2 times 10 to the plus 23 per mole.
So this is how much charge there is

00:43:07.660 --> 00:43:12.990
in a mole of electrons.
This is the number of carbons there

00:43:12.990 --> 00:43:18.330
is in a mole of carbon.
And this is given the value the

00:43:18.330 --> 00:43:23.410
notation N Avogadro **NAv**.
Avogadro's number we call it.

00:43:23.410 --> 00:43:28.240
Avogadro was a professor of
chemistry at the University of Turin

00:43:28.240 --> 00:43:33.080
who did a lot of work on gas laws,
understanding the number of gas

00:43:33.080 --> 00:43:37.910
particles in a given volume at a
given temperature.

00:43:37.910 --> 00:43:42.740
Isn't this nice? They name
constants after professors.

00:43:42.740 --> 00:43:47.580
They didn't name it after a
baseball player. They named

00:43:47.580 --> 00:43:52.830
it after a professor.
So now we know the Avogadro number

00:43:52.830 --> 00:43:58.490
and are able to count the quantities
accordingly. What I am going to do

00:43:58.490 --> 00:44:04.160
next day is go into the larger
stoichiometry and understand the

00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:09.830
principles of mass balance and
reactivity. But before you go,

00:44:09.830 --> 00:44:15.490
hold it, I don't want you racing off.
We should be going to 55 minutes

00:44:15.490 --> 00:44:21.160
after the hour,
so I have something to share with

00:44:21.160 --> 00:44:25.850
you.
I don't know if you heard this

00:44:25.850 --> 00:44:29.570
morning, but there was news of the
discovery of yet one more element.

00:44:29.570 --> 00:44:33.280
Anybody hear of it? I guess you
were busy. I got this off of NPR.

00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:36.990
It says the discovery of the
heaviest element known to science

00:44:36.990 --> 00:44:40.710
has been reported.
Obviously it has to be heavy.

00:44:40.710 --> 00:44:44.420
All the light ones have been
discovered. The new ones are going

00:44:44.420 --> 00:44:48.140
to be heavy, so that's great
reporting. The element tentatively

00:44:48.140 --> 00:44:52.130
named administratium.
It has been tentatively named

00:44:52.130 --> 00:44:56.390
administratium.
And this will have to go up before

00:44:56.390 --> 00:45:00.660
The International Union of Pure and
Applied Chemistry before they

00:45:00.660 --> 00:45:04.930
approve it because they fought over
element 106 for the longest time,

00:45:04.930 --> 00:45:09.190
but I think this will go through
fairly quickly.

00:45:09.190 --> 00:45:13.460
Maybe not. It has no protons,
so therefore, it has no electrons.

00:45:13.460 --> 00:45:17.730
Because proton number equals
electron number,

00:45:17.730 --> 00:45:37.326
which means if it has no protons its
atomic number is zero.

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:27.090
So you are learning already.
However, it does have one neutron.

00:45:27.090 --> 00:45:32.180
It has 125 assistants to the
neutron, it has 75 vice neutrons and

00:45:32.180 --> 00:45:37.270
111 assistants to the vice neutrons.
That gives it a mass number of 312.

00:45:37.270 --> 00:45:42.360
The 312 particles are held together
in a nucleus by a force that

00:45:42.360 --> 00:45:47.450
involves the continuous exchange of
meson-like particles

00:45:47.450 --> 00:45:52.250
called memo-ons.
These memo-ons just go back and

00:45:52.250 --> 00:45:56.750
forth. Now, there are no electrons
so there can be no electronic mail.

00:45:56.750 --> 00:46:01.250
We speculate there may be neutronic
mail here. But,

00:46:01.250 --> 00:46:05.750
anyway, let's talk about the
properties. Since it has no

00:46:05.750 --> 00:46:10.250
electrons, it must be chemically
inert. However,

00:46:10.250 --> 00:46:14.750
it can be detected indirectly
because it seems to impede every

00:46:14.750 --> 00:46:19.350
reaction in which it is present.
According to the discovers,

00:46:19.350 --> 00:46:24.070
the presence of a few nanograms of
administratium made one reaction

00:46:24.070 --> 00:46:28.780
that normally takes less than a
second take over four business days.

00:46:28.780 --> 00:46:33.490
Oh, there is more. Because it is
heavy you expect it is radioactive.

00:46:33.490 --> 00:46:38.210
It has a half-life of approximately
three years at which time it stops

00:46:38.210 --> 00:46:42.920
decaying. Then it undergoes a
reorganization in which the vice

00:46:42.920 --> 00:46:47.640
neutrons, assistants to the neutron,
the assistants to the vice neutrons

00:46:47.640 --> 00:46:52.300
exchange places.
And there are some early indications

00:46:52.300 --> 00:46:56.920
that the mass actually increases
after each reorganization.

00:46:56.920 --> 00:47:01.530
Now I will send you on the weekend
with a chemistry joke.

00:47:01.530 --> 00:47:06.150
We have to have a little bit of
humor. I need it quiet,

00:47:06.150 --> 00:47:10.760
though. It comes right over here.
Actually, this one. We have to put

00:47:10.760 --> 00:47:15.380
the audio visual up.
This is the one you need.

00:47:15.380 --> 00:47:33.826
You need this one right here.
Can you see this?

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:04.500
OK. Neutron walks into a bar and
sits down at the bar.

00:47:04.500 --> 00:47:09.000
The bartender looks at him and says
I know you. You're a neutron.

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:13.500
He says, yeah, yeah, I'm a neutron.
Neutron is kind of quiet. Finally,

00:47:13.500 --> 00:47:18.000
he looks up and says how much for a
beer? The bartender says,

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:22.133
"for you, no charge." OK. Get out
of here. Have a nice weekend.
