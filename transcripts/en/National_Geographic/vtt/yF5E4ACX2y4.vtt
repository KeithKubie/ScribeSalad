00:00:01.567 --> 00:00:02.500
CHRISTIAN OHNEISER: I'm pretty
certain that we're going

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:04.233
to lose the actual
ice shelf itself

00:00:04.233 --> 00:00:06.333
and parts of the West
Antarctic Ice Sheet

00:00:06.333 --> 00:00:07.700
at some point in the future.

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:08.900
It will turn into water.

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:10.734
But it's where that water
goes and how much of it

00:00:10.734 --> 00:00:13.066
turns actually into sea level
that's the big question, right?

00:00:13.066 --> 00:00:16.133
Six to seven meters requires a
whole reorganization of how we

00:00:16.133 --> 00:00:18.567
live and our civilization
because you--

00:00:18.567 --> 00:00:21.300
you write off some of the most
populated parts of the world,

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.400
you know?

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.200
Downtown London-- well,
I guess that's gone.

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.266
NARRATOR: In order to study the
ice shelf's geological history,

00:00:27.266 --> 00:00:29.200
they need to find
sediment on the sea floor

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.767
beneath it so they
can sample it as part

00:00:31.767 --> 00:00:33.734
of the project in future years.

00:00:33.734 --> 00:00:35.767
I mean, we can throw
the stream right now

00:00:35.767 --> 00:00:38.400
and then thump our way along.

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.367
We just want to make sure that--
that this is the right place.

00:00:41.367 --> 00:00:44.033
You know, we've just dragged
all this equipment out here.

00:00:44.033 --> 00:00:46.533
The immediate goal is just
see the sea floor-- make sure

00:00:46.533 --> 00:00:48.667
it's there and that
it's flat and smooth

00:00:48.667 --> 00:00:50.734
and that there aren't
big rocks in the way.

00:00:50.734 --> 00:00:52.667
What number are we up to?

00:00:52.667 --> 00:00:53.967
LAURINE VAN HAASTRECHT: 17!

00:00:53.967 --> 00:00:54.734
CHRISTIAN OHNEISER:
For the science world,

00:00:54.734 --> 00:00:55.867
this is a big deal.

00:00:55.867 --> 00:00:58.200
You know, we're talking
about megabucks for us,

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.166
a lot of time-- a lot of
effort from a lot of people.

00:01:00.166 --> 00:01:01.934
This has a lot riding on it.

00:01:01.934 --> 00:01:04.800
NARRATOR: To determine if
they're in the right spot,

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.834
the team will launch a
hydraulically-driven 500-pound

00:01:07.834 --> 00:01:11.367
weight called The
Thumper at the ice,

00:01:11.367 --> 00:01:14.433
then use the reflected
sound heard by 96

00:01:14.433 --> 00:01:17.233
geological microphones
to create a picture

00:01:17.233 --> 00:01:18.767
of what they can't see.

00:01:18.767 --> 00:01:20.633
Basically, we're slicing
through the ice shelf,

00:01:20.633 --> 00:01:22.066
through the ocean, and
into the sea floor.

00:01:22.066 --> 00:01:23.967
We turn that slice on its side.

00:01:23.967 --> 00:01:25.533
And they we can see
the different layers

00:01:25.533 --> 00:01:26.900
inside the ocean.

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.867
We actually tap the
snow out of these things.

00:01:28.867 --> 00:01:30.867
CHRISTIAN OHNEISER: So we don't
have a short circuit, right?

00:01:30.867 --> 00:01:31.834
MAN: Exactly.

00:01:31.834 --> 00:01:32.867
CHRISTIAN OHNEISER:
So our goal is

00:01:32.867 --> 00:01:33.667
to actually get that
picture of what's

00:01:33.667 --> 00:01:34.734
underneath the ice shelf.

00:01:34.734 --> 00:01:36.533
And we hope that our
research will impact

00:01:36.533 --> 00:01:38.033
those people that
decide, right, climate

00:01:38.033 --> 00:01:39.266
change-- this is a problem now.

00:01:39.266 --> 00:01:41.166
This carbon dioxide is
going to kill the ice.

00:01:41.166 --> 00:01:42.100
It's going to melt it.

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:43.266
And we're going
to be in trouble.

00:01:43.266 --> 00:01:44.767
We've been building
equipment for six months.

00:01:44.767 --> 00:01:47.166
And we're just really excited
to actually get into it.

00:01:47.166 --> 00:01:48.166
LAURINE VAN HAASTRECHT: Ready?

00:01:48.166 --> 00:01:49.767
CHRISTIAN OHNEISER: Yup!
[thump]

00:01:49.767 --> 00:01:50.767
[impressed laughter]

00:01:50.767 --> 00:01:51.800
LAURINE VAN HAASTRECHT:
There it was.

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:52.767
CHRISTIAN OHNEISER:
You can feel that!

00:01:52.767 --> 00:01:53.600
MAN: It didn't trigger.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:54.533
LAURINE VAN HAASTRECHT: Uh-oh.

00:01:54.533 --> 00:01:56.033
Is it triggering on the way up?

00:01:56.033 --> 00:01:57.000
MAN: It triggered, though.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.133
CHRISTIAN OHNEISER:
Well, [bleep].

00:01:58.133 --> 00:01:59.467
That's not good.

00:01:59.467 --> 00:02:01.233
LAURINE VAN HAASTRECHT:
That's just the way it drops.

00:02:01.233 --> 00:02:02.500
It hit the switch.

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.033
And it triggers the system
and basically triggers the

00:02:04.033 --> 00:02:05.867
microphones to start listening.

00:02:05.867 --> 00:02:08.066
For some reason, it's not doing
it when the weight goes down

00:02:08.066 --> 00:02:09.433
but when the weight goes up.

00:02:09.433 --> 00:02:11.533
So we're just trying to sort
figure out why it's doing that.

00:02:11.533 --> 00:02:12.500
[thud]

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.367
MAN: It didn't trigger again.

00:02:14.367 --> 00:02:15.800
NARRATOR: If The
Thumper and geophones

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.233
are even milliseconds
out of sync,

00:02:18.233 --> 00:02:19.533
the results are worthless.

00:02:19.533 --> 00:02:21.133
LAURINE VAN HAASTRECHT: I
think I can see the problem.

00:02:21.133 --> 00:02:23.600
The sled has got too
many links at the back.

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.300
So now it's not
centered properly.

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.867
I think we need to pull
back from it slightly.

00:02:27.867 --> 00:02:29.934
All of our systems have
come from different areas

00:02:29.934 --> 00:02:31.000
around the globe.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.633
So our geophone streamer
came from Germany.

00:02:34.633 --> 00:02:36.633
Our computer system
and the geodes,

00:02:36.633 --> 00:02:38.266
they came from the States.

00:02:38.266 --> 00:02:40.533
So it is a little
bit nerve wracking

00:02:40.533 --> 00:02:43.333
to see whether all of those
components do interact

00:02:43.333 --> 00:02:46.533
and whether they work in
an Antarctic environment.

00:02:46.533 --> 00:02:47.367
[thud]

00:02:47.367 --> 00:02:48.467
MAN: OK, it triggered.

00:02:48.467 --> 00:02:49.667
So that's good.

00:02:49.667 --> 00:02:51.266
LAURINE VAN HAASTRECHT:
So we're ready to move up?

00:02:51.266 --> 00:02:51.967
MAN: Yup, move up.

00:02:55.567 --> 00:02:56.867
LAURINE VAN
HAASTRECHT: If our team

00:02:56.867 --> 00:03:00.533
is unsuccessful for
finding a proper location,

00:03:00.533 --> 00:03:03.867
then it is basically the end
of that aspect of the program.

00:03:03.867 --> 00:03:06.633
So I think we are a
little bit worried.

00:03:06.633 --> 00:03:08.066
[thud]
