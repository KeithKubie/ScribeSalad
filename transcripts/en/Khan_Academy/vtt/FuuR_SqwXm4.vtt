00:00:00.398 --> 00:00:02.250
- [Voiceover] We're gonna talk
about the natural response

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.507
of an LC circuit, inductor
capacitor circuit.

00:00:06.507 --> 00:00:07.808
And this is an interesting one,

00:00:07.808 --> 00:00:11.183
this is a circuit that has
two energy storage elements.

00:00:11.183 --> 00:00:14.543
In the past videos we've done
one energy storage element,

00:00:14.543 --> 00:00:16.931
either a C or an L,

00:00:16.931 --> 00:00:18.689
and this time we're gonna put 'em together

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:21.127
and see what they do as a pair.

00:00:21.127 --> 00:00:23.841
And there's no resistor in this circuit.

00:00:23.841 --> 00:00:26.058
So this is interesting because we

00:00:26.058 --> 00:00:28.808
have two energy storage elements.

00:00:36.287 --> 00:00:37.120
Elements.

00:00:39.984 --> 00:00:41.039
Well, what does that mean?

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:43.734
That means for a capacitor,

00:00:43.734 --> 00:00:48.213
there's some charge
stored on the capacitor,

00:00:48.213 --> 00:00:49.432
and that typically means that

00:00:49.432 --> 00:00:52.552
there's an excessive charge
on one of the plates.

00:00:52.552 --> 00:00:55.544
So in this case there's an
excessive positive charge

00:00:55.544 --> 00:00:56.696
on the top plate

00:00:56.696 --> 00:00:58.934
or you could say in the same way there's a

00:00:58.934 --> 00:01:00.934
lack of negative charge,

00:01:01.922 --> 00:01:03.905
there's some negative charge
missing from the top plate

00:01:03.905 --> 00:01:05.002
and that centers some extra

00:01:05.002 --> 00:01:07.443
negative charge on the bottom plate.

00:01:07.443 --> 00:01:11.730
So that's what we mean by
capacitor storing charge.

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:13.579
So how does an inductor store energy?

00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:16.226
Well this stores its
energy in a magnetic field.

00:01:16.226 --> 00:01:18.559
It's out in the space around

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:21.940
around the inductor.

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:25.379
So when we have a current
flowing in an inductor,

00:01:25.379 --> 00:01:29.097
its energy is stored in a
magnetic field like that.

00:01:29.097 --> 00:01:33.477
So that's what we mean by
two energy storage elements.

00:01:33.477 --> 00:01:36.281
Now one thing we know
about the q in a capacitor,

00:01:36.281 --> 00:01:39.470
is q equals cv.

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:41.439
So if there is some q here,

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:44.356
that means there's some voltage here.

00:01:44.356 --> 00:01:46.724
So this is the voltage we're
gonna track in this circuit,

00:01:46.724 --> 00:01:49.821
that's the voltage between
these two nodes here.

00:01:49.821 --> 00:01:52.779
And because there's an inductor,

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:54.932
one of the interesting things
is the current in the inductor

00:01:54.932 --> 00:01:58.682
so I'm gonna draw the
current arrow this way.

00:02:00.226 --> 00:02:01.466
And one thing I wanna point out is

00:02:01.466 --> 00:02:04.908
if I define the inductor
current going down

00:02:04.908 --> 00:02:06.961
through the inductor that same current

00:02:06.961 --> 00:02:09.794
is going up through the capacitor.

00:02:11.646 --> 00:02:12.876
So our challenge when we wanna know what

00:02:12.876 --> 00:02:14.928
the natural response of this is,

00:02:14.928 --> 00:02:17.549
is we put in some energy

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:21.145
and in this case we'll put
in some q on the capacitor

00:02:21.145 --> 00:02:23.645
and we'll let i start at zero.

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:29.002
And then we step back and we
watch what this circuit does.

00:02:29.002 --> 00:02:31.468
And what that means is we figure out what

00:02:31.468 --> 00:02:33.796
the voltage is as a function of time,

00:02:33.796 --> 00:02:35.368
and the current as a function of time,

00:02:35.368 --> 00:02:37.149
and both of those things together

00:02:37.149 --> 00:02:40.566
is the natural response of an LC circuit.

00:02:41.546 --> 00:02:45.713
So in this video what I wanna
do is predict the shape.

00:02:48.364 --> 00:02:50.614
We're gonna predict the NI,

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:53.980
we're just gonna do this intuitively.

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:55.820
And then in the next sequence of videos,

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:59.295
we'll work it out exactly
with a mathematical precision,

00:02:59.295 --> 00:03:01.477
what this natural response looks like.

00:03:01.477 --> 00:03:02.422
And then we'll look to see if the

00:03:02.422 --> 00:03:05.674
mathematics matches our intuition.

00:03:05.674 --> 00:03:07.584
A good way to make this prediction,

00:03:07.584 --> 00:03:08.687
what we're gonna do,

00:03:08.687 --> 00:03:11.038
is we're gonna follow
and track what happens

00:03:11.038 --> 00:03:12.705
to this charge here

00:03:13.598 --> 00:03:17.966
as this circuit relaxes
in its natural response.

00:03:17.966 --> 00:03:19.906
So, first thing, let's
just write some equations,

00:03:19.906 --> 00:03:22.771
the element equations for the L and the C.

00:03:22.771 --> 00:03:26.938
And we know for an inductor,
v equals L times di dt.

00:03:32.809 --> 00:03:35.756
So voltage is proportional
to the value of the inductor

00:03:35.756 --> 00:03:37.263
times the slope of the current

00:03:37.263 --> 00:03:40.253
or the rate of change of the current.

00:03:40.253 --> 00:03:41.470
For a capacitor, we know that

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.553
i equals C times the slope
of the voltage, dv dt.

00:03:50.066 --> 00:03:53.080
And one thing we know is
that both of these equations

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.174
are true all the time.

00:03:55.174 --> 00:03:56.608
So that's gonna help us out.

00:03:56.608 --> 00:03:58.068
And the way we look at this intuitively

00:03:58.068 --> 00:04:00.155
is we're gonna track the charge,

00:04:00.155 --> 00:04:02.013
and we're gonna look at
what happens in this circuit

00:04:02.013 --> 00:04:06.575
moment to moment as that
charge moves around.

00:04:06.575 --> 00:04:08.648
So what I'm gonna do,
just to get us set up,

00:04:08.648 --> 00:04:09.550
just to get us set up here.

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:12.587
I'm gonna take out a little
chunk of the circuit here,

00:04:12.587 --> 00:04:15.504
and then put in a switch like that.

00:04:16.957 --> 00:04:21.366
So here's a switch and
that switch is gonna close

00:04:21.366 --> 00:04:23.033
at time equals zero.

00:04:24.809 --> 00:04:26.678
So before the switch closes,

00:04:26.678 --> 00:04:29.746
we're gonna put some
charge on this capacitor,

00:04:29.746 --> 00:04:33.830
there's gonna be a
voltage on the capacitor.

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:35.710
The capacitor will have
a voltage of v naught,

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:37.377
so that means that v

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:44.170
of time less than zero equals v naught,

00:04:45.012 --> 00:04:47.462
we'll just call it v naught.

00:04:47.462 --> 00:04:48.649
And what else do we know?

00:04:48.649 --> 00:04:50.110
Well the switch is open,

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:53.984
so that means that the
current through this loop,

00:04:53.984 --> 00:04:56.259
the current in our circuit is zero,

00:04:56.259 --> 00:04:59.592
so i, we can write i of t less than zero

00:05:02.684 --> 00:05:03.913
equals zero.

00:05:03.913 --> 00:05:06.464
So there's two things we
know about the circuit.

00:05:06.464 --> 00:05:09.085
So now we're ready to close the switch.

00:05:09.085 --> 00:05:10.699
And we're gonna take a break right now

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:11.979
and I'll see you in the next video.
