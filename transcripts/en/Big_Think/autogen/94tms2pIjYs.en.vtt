00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700
really matters in a startups culture and
 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.250
really matters in a startups culture and
the premise is you know you can have

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260
the premise is you know you can have
 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.500
the premise is you know you can have
whatever set of values on the wall but

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510
whatever set of values on the wall but
 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.240
whatever set of values on the wall but
at the end of the day it's who gets

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250
at the end of the day it's who gets
 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.819
at the end of the day it's who gets
fired and who gets hired and who gets

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:20.829

gonna act with integrity but people who

00:03:32.789 --> 00:03:32.799
gonna act with integrity but people who
 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:34.289
gonna act with integrity but people who
don't act with integrity are getting

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:34.299
don't act with integrity are getting
 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:37.949
don't act with integrity are getting
fired or not getting fired doesn't

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:37.959
fired or not getting fired doesn't
 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:40.199
fired or not getting fired doesn't
matter right so I think this is actually

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:40.209
matter right so I think this is actually
 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:43.319
matter right so I think this is actually
a really good analogy for why these

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:43.329

that you know that there rewards you up

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750
that you know that there rewards you up
 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:18.779
that you know that there rewards you up
to a point and then all of a sudden you

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:18.789
to a point and then all of a sudden you
 

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:21.839
to a point and then all of a sudden you
know you're banned from the platform if

00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:21.849
know you're banned from the platform if
 

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:23.999
know you're banned from the platform if
you're Alex Jones or you're someone

who's just a little bit too incendiary I
think what these platforms you know need

00:04:28.379 --> 00:04:28.389
think what these platforms you know need
 

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:30.060
think what these platforms you know need
to do because there's no such thing as

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.070
to do because there's no such thing as
 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:31.500
to do because there's no such thing as
neutral

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:31.510
neutral
 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:33.240
neutral
and because the values that get you

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.250
and because the values that get you
 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:35.160
and because the values that get you
promoted are really out of sync with the

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:35.170
promoted are really out of sync with the
 

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:39.660
promoted are really out of sync with the
values that get you fired or demoted you

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:39.670
values that get you fired or demoted you
 

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:41.310
values that get you fired or demoted you
know the only thing that that these

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:41.320
know the only thing that that these
 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.920
know the only thing that that these
platforms can do is kind of state their

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:43.930
platforms can do is kind of state their
 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:47.340
platforms can do is kind of state their
principles and be consistent about them

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:47.350
principles and be consistent about them
 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:50.010
principles and be consistent about them
both in terms of who gets to be heard by

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.020
both in terms of who gets to be heard by
 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:51.840
both in terms of who gets to be heard by
lots of people and who doesn't get to be

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:51.850
lots of people and who doesn't get to be
 

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:53.880
lots of people and who doesn't get to be
heard at all and I think that's a

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:53.890
heard at all and I think that's a
 

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:57.020
heard at all and I think that's a
challenging position for them because

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.030
challenging position for them because
 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:00.480
challenging position for them because
you know some people will disagree with

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:00.490
you know some people will disagree with
 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:02.610
you know some people will disagree with
whatever values they state if Twitter

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:02.620
whatever values they state if Twitter
 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:05.850
whatever values they state if Twitter
decides that respectful conversation as

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:07.920
decides that respectful conversation as
one of their top values that's going to

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:07.930
one of their top values that's going to
 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:09.450
one of their top values that's going to
privilege some kinds of conversation

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:09.460
privilege some kinds of conversation
 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:11.250
privilege some kinds of conversation
over other kinds of conversation it's

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:11.260
over other kinds of conversation it's
 

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:12.720
over other kinds of conversation it's
going to be better for some users than

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:12.730
going to be better for some users than
 

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:14.490
going to be better for some users than
others but at least it's a transparent

principle that we can all understand

principle that we can all understand
 

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:21.060
principle that we can all understand
that can be used to decide you know what

that can be used to decide you know what
 

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:22.740
that can be used to decide you know what
what the principles what the physics of

this system are and right now I think we

this system are and right now I think we
 

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:27.440
this system are and right now I think we
have this very confusing set of

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:27.450
have this very confusing set of
 

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:31.950
have this very confusing set of
conflicting signals where where things

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:31.960
conflicting signals where where things
 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:33.850
conflicting signals where where things
are totally out of whack

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:33.860
are totally out of whack
 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:42.570
are totally out of whack
