00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:01.430
What do you think David?

00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:03.610
&gt;&gt; So
this is kind of an interesting example.

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:06.390
If we recall back in our original
tree as to the incremental

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.780
concept learning process, we saw that
there was those do nothing bubbles,

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.200
that if a negative example does
not fit our current definition,

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.385
we wouldn't actually modify
our current definition.

00:00:15.385 --> 00:00:18.536
Here this doesn't even fit
our current concept of a foo.

00:00:18.536 --> 00:00:22.715
Our current concept of a foo has a brick
on top, whereas this is a wedge on top.

00:00:22.715 --> 00:00:25.494
So this doesn't even fit, so we don't
actually need to change our concept,

00:00:25.494 --> 00:00:26.805
it doesn't fit already.

00:00:26.805 --> 00:00:28.215
&gt;&gt; Good, very good.

00:00:29.305 --> 00:00:33.415
If the example is a negative instance,
and the current definition of

00:00:33.415 --> 00:00:36.145
the concept already excludes it,
we don't have to do anything.
