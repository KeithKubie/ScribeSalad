00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.960
In today's video,

00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:04.120
we are going to see
if we can powderize a steak.

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:10.500
[Music]

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.020
Guys, in the past, we've
dehydrated a number of things,

00:00:13.026 --> 00:00:14.875
but all of them
have been liquid,

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.450
or at least mostly, liquid.

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:19.660
We want to move on to
something a little bit different.

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.240
So today, we've got steak.

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.840
If you take steak, and you
put it in a normal dehydrator,

00:00:24.848 --> 00:00:26.350
you basically get beef jerky,

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:27.840
and that's not what
we're going for.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.977
We want to just
completely dry it out,

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.480
and for that,
we have a new toy.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.120
Guys, this is our new baby.

00:00:35.126 --> 00:00:36.452
This is a freeze dryer.

00:00:36.452 --> 00:00:39.300
We're gonna do so
many weird things with this.

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.180
So a freeze dryer is
like a dehydrator on steroids.

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.960
It's crazy what
this thing can do.

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.540
The general idea is
that this machine first,

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:48.708
you put the food in,

00:00:48.708 --> 00:00:50.650
and it can do
all sorts of things.

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:51.621
It gets cold.

00:00:51.621 --> 00:00:53.002
It gets really cold,

00:00:53.002 --> 00:00:55.832
50 to 70 degrees
below zero in Fahrenheit.

00:00:55.832 --> 00:00:57.538
After it gets down
to that temperature,

00:00:57.538 --> 00:00:58.750
it starts pulling a vacuum.

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:00.200
You put your food
in these trays,

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.220
and everything in there
gets pulled into that vacuum,

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:04.780
and once all the air
is pulled out,

00:01:04.784 --> 00:01:06.250
it starts warming back up.

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.960
At that point,
in the super low pressure,

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.240
all of the water
that was in food,

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.073
it's frozen because super cold,

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.180
and then as it warms up,
it starts to sublimate.

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.940
It goes directly
from ice into water vapor

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.714
in the air without going
through a liquid stage.

00:01:19.714 --> 00:01:22.361
So it does kind of
what dry ice does normally,

00:01:22.361 --> 00:01:23.369
but water only does

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.780
that when it's
under such low pressure.

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.170
So you've probably actually
had freeze-dried food before

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.380
and didn't know it.

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.559
Fruit and cereals,
marshmallows in Lucky Charms,

00:01:31.559 --> 00:01:33.350
and if you've ever
been backpacking,

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.550
I'm sure you've had a freeze
dry backpacking meal before.

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:38.300
So it's very useful.

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:39.600
So here's the basic idea.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.892
We have got a new freeze dryer,
and we want to play with it.

00:01:41.892 --> 00:01:43.992
So the first thing
that we're going to try,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.600
some raw steak
and some cooked steak,

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.800
and see what happens.

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.600
Let's go cook a few steaks.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:02:16.000
[Music]

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.980
Lovely.

00:02:16.982 --> 00:02:19.629
Germs will survive
the freeze drying process.

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:21.218
So this is not like cooking

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.440
or even dehydrating
with salt on it

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:24.620
where you can then eat it.

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.340
Like this, this
is not going to kill germs.

00:02:26.352 --> 00:02:28.000
So if we freeze
dried these steaks,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.620
and then tried to eat
the raw freeze-dried steak,

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.380
we're just as much risk as
if we're eating the steak raw,

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:34.860
which isn't a ton,
but it is something.

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.420
Oh yeah, it's good.

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:44.480
[Music]

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.940
Our steaks have now been
freeze-drying for quite a while.

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.700
We actually gave
them two full days,

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.263
because they're
pretty thick steaks,

00:02:50.263 --> 00:02:51.473
and we wanted to hopefully,

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.300
get them freeze dried
all the way through.

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.860
So now, I think we needed
to find out if it worked.

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.060
Oh, product from dryer.

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:00.500
Here it goes.

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:01.352
Oh, that's cold.

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:03.400
I guess that's the point.

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.180
It keeps it--

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.100
That is well
below the temperature

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.500
of a regular freezer.

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.940
Those are some frozen steaks.

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:12.120
Oh, well, they weigh nothing.

00:03:12.133 --> 00:03:13.450
They are so much lighter.

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:14.166
So I actually,

00:03:14.166 --> 00:03:17.056
I actually have a scale
over here just for this reason.

00:03:17.056 --> 00:03:18.074
I, unfortunately,

00:03:18.074 --> 00:03:20.350
didn't think to weigh
these beforehand,

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:23.020
but a steak this size
would normally weigh,

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:25.140
you know, easily over a pound.

00:03:25.142 --> 00:03:27.495
So I'm curious to see
what it weighs now.

00:03:27.495 --> 00:03:29.550
So less than half a pound now.

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:32.560
That is probably a pound
of water lost honestly.

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.900
What's he difference between
a cooked one and uncooked?

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:38.360
It's even lighter.

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:39.280
That's even lighter.

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.780
So it probably
lost some moisture

00:03:40.795 --> 00:03:42.089
when we're cooking it.

00:03:42.089 --> 00:03:43.183
Yep.
And I don't know.

00:03:43.183 --> 00:03:44.167
We didn't compare

00:03:44.167 --> 00:03:47.050
the weight of these two
before we dehydrated them,

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:48.260
freeze dried them.

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:50.360
There we go.

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:54.200
So we've now got
three raw steaks

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.760
and three cooked steaks.

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.060
So now, we need
to do some experiments.

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:01.650
Well, I want to know
if the cooked ones are edible,

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.540
and if we can save
the raw ones at all.

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:04.660
I think we can.

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:08.900
They're supposed
to be rehydratable.

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:10.180
Rehydratable.

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:10.880
Rehydra--

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.740
We say rehydratable
is a word now.

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:14.940
It's like--

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.300
But actually, even
more than that,

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:18.040
I'm curious what it looks
like on the inside.

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:21.040
So I want to cut in half one
of each of these.

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.200
Wow.

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:30.840
There we go.

00:04:32.032 --> 00:04:34.724
It just looks
like a frozen steak...

00:04:36.622 --> 00:04:38.492
But it sounds like a cracker.

00:04:38.492 --> 00:04:40.882
It's kind of powdery.

00:04:41.232 --> 00:04:43.646
Small piece of
freeze-dried steak,

00:04:43.646 --> 00:04:44.960
see how this goes.

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:53.600
It's like a steak cracker.

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:56.540
I actually like it.

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:57.560
Yeah?

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:58.200
Yeah.

00:04:58.900 --> 00:04:59.640
Not a lot.

00:04:59.642 --> 00:05:00.982
I want more.

00:05:02.452 --> 00:05:04.538
Tastes like roast beef, but one

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:06.980
that you've overdone
by about four days.

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:10.860
Okay, well..

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.640
This will be my snack now.

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:17.080
That's good.

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:18.160
Got a little piece here.

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.840
I'm going to see what happens
if I dip it into some hot water,

00:05:20.842 --> 00:05:23.592
see if it'll sort of
reconstitute into cooked steak.

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:26.720
A lot of air bubbles.

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:30.800
It lost all the pretty color.

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:31.380
I think it was--

00:05:31.391 --> 00:05:32.068
It's too hot.

00:05:32.068 --> 00:05:33.111
This water is hotter

00:05:33.111 --> 00:05:35.300
than you should actually
cook a steak so...

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:38.502
So you're going to put
it in your mouth?

00:05:38.502 --> 00:05:44.680
[Music]

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:48.480
Again, I would say it tastes
more like roast beef,

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:50.813
but I did just eat it up
with water that was too hot.

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:54.250
Next, I think we're going to take
this freeze-dried raw steak,

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:56.595
and we're going to try
branding and grilling it

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:58.300
while it's still freeze dried,

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:00.392
and then we'll see
if we can reconstitute it.

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:04.560
Okay then, you never
really get any sound.

00:06:04.562 --> 00:06:05.472
Really didn't.

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:12.780
[Music]

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:15.020
The whole steak just melted.

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:18.740
[Music]

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:19.340
That's a--

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:22.340
That's a lot more
of a burn than last time.

00:06:23.722 --> 00:06:26.050
Curious, have we already
started like burning the--

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:27.380
Oh, there you go.

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:29.636
That's only been on there
for like a minute

00:06:29.636 --> 00:06:30.852
and a half probably.

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:33.000
It doesn't feel hot though.

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:37.220
You should not eat
raw freeze-dried meat.

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:39.440
However, with a steak,

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:42.350
the danger is the germs
that are on the surface.

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:45.492
The germs don't travel
down inside the meat.

00:06:45.492 --> 00:06:48.345
So by cooking the entire
outside of this,

00:06:48.345 --> 00:06:51.880
we should be creating something
that's safe to eat.

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:54.060
I don't know
if it's good to eat,

00:06:54.071 --> 00:06:55.050
but if safe to eat.

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:57.062
We're gonna try either way.

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:04.144
I smell-- I say it smells
like burnt bacon, overcooked.

00:07:04.262 --> 00:07:06.000
Like it's not a good smell.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.615
So that's concerning.

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:10.082
Oh my gosh.

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:13.080
That really softened back up.

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:15.320
## this off.

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:17.440
What is happening here?

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:25.000
Well, we disconnected the fat
from the rest of the meat.

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:27.050
That's..

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:28.400
That's a nightmare.

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:29.800
This is a nightmare.

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:32.700
Oh no.

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:37.800
This is just like
a blue rare steak,

00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:40.062
but freeze-dried.

00:07:40.062 --> 00:07:48.680
[Music]

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:49.422
It's softer.

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:51.900
Not as bad as I was expecting.

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:54.080
We've got a couple
more cooked steaks.

00:07:54.085 --> 00:07:55.438
These are safe to eat.

00:07:55.438 --> 00:07:55.746
Yeah.

00:07:55.746 --> 00:07:57.100
They're also very dry.

00:07:57.540 --> 00:07:58.480
To the point

00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:00.200
that you can literally
just break in half.

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:04.860
I want to see if we
can blend this into a powder.

00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:06.840
And what are we going
to do with that powder?

00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:08.802
That remains to be seen.

00:08:08.802 --> 00:08:26.580
[Music]

00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:29.200
I mean, people make
shredded chicken spreads.

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:32.052
Why not a shredded steak spread?

00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:34.340
This is very very shredded.

00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:40.620
[Music]

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:43.860
It's like mulch,
but made of steak.

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:44.740
Okay.

00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:45.680
Now, you can tell

00:08:45.691 --> 00:08:49.229
that there was moisture
in it once upon a time.

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:50.060
It's molding.

00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:51.220
It's like sand.

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:52.380
Gross.

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:55.040
But you know we
have to do, right?

00:08:55.650 --> 00:08:57.000
What do we have to do?

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.320
We have to try it.

00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:00.059
We have to add water
back into this.

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:02.960
You really want to make
a protein smoothie.

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:04.580
We're gonna make
a steak smoothie.

00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:10.720
Say when.

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:13.640
Let's start with that.

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:14.800
Okay?

00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:16.540
Good.

00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:18.080
That looks great.

00:09:20.882 --> 00:09:22.780
Wait, I had salt.

00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:24.440
Add a little bit of salt.

00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:29.240
There's no way we're
not gonna regret this.

00:09:30.032 --> 00:09:30.620
All right.

00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:32.174
Here goes the grossest thing

00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:33.960
that has ever been
done on this show.

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:42.520
[Music]

00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:44.050
I call that the
consistency of salsa.

00:09:44.050 --> 00:09:47.511
Yeah, I'd say it's alive,
but it is very dead.

00:09:47.520 --> 00:10:02.560
[Music]

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:04.914
Guys, we got the Hacksmith here
with us, and apparently,

00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:06.320
he is very brave,

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:07.540
because we now
have two textures.

00:10:07.543 --> 00:10:09.366
We've got one
that had some water,

00:10:09.366 --> 00:10:10.802
and it's sort of like a...

00:10:10.902 --> 00:10:13.225
You described this is
cat food consistency.

00:10:13.225 --> 00:10:14.780
Yeah, it looks like cat food.

00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:16.300
I, to be a little more generous,

00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:18.460
I'm going to say it's
about the consistency of

00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:19.632
like tuna fish.

00:10:19.632 --> 00:10:21.565
And then we have
a thinner consistency.

00:10:21.565 --> 00:10:23.798
It's actually been mixed
with more water,

00:10:23.798 --> 00:10:25.250
and it's about consistency

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:27.257
of a thin milkshake
or a smoothie.

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:30.380
So you may want
to give us a 3, 2, 1 on our death.

00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:34.480
Three...

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:35.400
I'm going for it.

00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:36.400
One.

00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:40.360
No.

00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:44.720
You know.

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:47.780
I thought I'll be worse.

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:48.760
Oh.

00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:52.280
Okay, actually,

00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:55.560
if you put that on a cracker,
I can get through it.

00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:58.720
[Music]

00:10:58.780 --> 00:10:59.820
Cheers!

00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:05.560
[Music]

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:06.560
Aint it great?

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:12.080
Oh my gosh.

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:12.956
Did you want to--

00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:14.760
You want to take a gulp there?

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:16.460
You know you wanna?

00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:17.420
Yeah, it's warm.

00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:20.760
I like my smoothies cold.

00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:22.840
Nah, this would be worse cold.

00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:24.000
I'm pretty sure.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.680
[Music]

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:29.460
Oh, ew.

00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:30.420
Ew.

00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:33.280
[Inaudible].

00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:42.260
You got a couple
of swallows down.

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:42.780
That was...

00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:44.140
That was more than either of us.

00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:50.000
I don't know
if I'm impressed or disgusted.

00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:55.080
[Music]

00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:56.300
Well, I'm going back to Canada.

00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:57.300
That's fair.

00:11:57.720 --> 00:11:58.760
I approve.

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:00.540
We're weird. We know.

00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:02.860
&gt;&gt; Yeah, he's out.
&gt;&gt; He's-- Bye.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:04.060
Hacksmith is out.

00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:04.900
That was too much for him.

00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:05.840
We scared him off.

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:06.580
He's gone.

00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:08.320
Like I just had breakfast.

00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:10.080
So I'm not even hungry.

00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:12.540
This would taste better
if I was hungry.

00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:17.580
[Music]

00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:18.680
It is overcooked.

00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:22.220
[Music]

00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:24.260
All right, you want something
to wash that down with?

00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:27.740
It is warm.

00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:31.600
And not warm enough to be
like a hot drink.

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:32.300
It's just like--

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:34.360
That's warm-ish.

00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:38.420
Quick [inaudible].

00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:45.780
[Music]

00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:47.420
Guys, we've got
a sale going on right now.

00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:48.960
