JASON SILVA: The
philosopher Joseph Campbell

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.635
used to say that when we
are transfixed by beauty,

00:00:22.635 --> 00:00:26.980
we are beheld in a kind
of ecstatic arrest.

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:27.600
Right?

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.520
We are so transfixed
that we stop breathing.

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:31.750
We well up inside.

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:34.510
We experience what
Camus says as life

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.090
lived to the point of tears.

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.190
And why do we love these
experiences so much?

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:40.770
Because they arrest time.

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:41.860
They freeze time.

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.020
They force us to marvel.

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.030
They allow us to become
contemplative beings,

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:48.960
to enter those
head spaces outside

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.170
of normal Euclidean
space and time,

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.060
and provide a kind of respite
of the human condition.

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.090
We temporarily step
off that people

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:58.340
mover that's carrying
everyone else towards death.

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.070
And we become gods
outside of time,

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.040
reveling in a kind of
ecstatic illumination,

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.640
staring into the
sun and being moved

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.890
by its magnificent oppulence.

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.460
The universe singing
in rapture, and us just

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:14.650
like drowning in it.

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:16.390
It's like the last
scene in the movie

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.900
"The Fountain," when he
becomes the bubble that

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.310
explodes in space.

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.740
There's a kind of mythic
death and rebirth,

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.850
this resurrection happening.

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.900
We smash our sense of
separateness in these moments.

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.210
Yeah, it's kind of wonderful.

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:33.400
I think that's why we do it.

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:34.500
It's therapy.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.410
Awe is therapy.

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:37.356
Inspiration is therapy.
