00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:12.469
Hi I'm Ramazan Salman. I'm social to Zentrum
in Germany. I learned much of things and I

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:25.029
got much of impulses with this. And most important
thing I learned here is that to beat the economic

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:32.150
crisis, to deal with the economic crisis,
not money is the most important thing. I think

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:38.700
the most important thing is to have one voice,
one idea, which brings all the people together,

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:46.120
which motivates all the people to work together
and to work against the crisis. And as is

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:54.300
result, one result is cooperation of civil
society sector, of economic sector, of political

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:03.240
sector, and of sanctity sector. There is no
sustainable solution possible against the

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:12.429
crisis. And while we work against the crisis
it's very important to remember that there

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:22.229
are people who are not bankers or financial
directors. There are much of people who are

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.659
workers, who are simple people

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:33.049
[pause]

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:38.639
We have to find a way to work the best together
to work against the crisis. It's not only

00:01:38.639 --> 00:01:45.189
a crisis on the economic sector, it's a world
wide crisis which influence the social, the

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:55.179
educational, the head sector. It influences
every part of society sectors in this world.

00:01:55.179 --> 00:02:02.149
The other thing is, and I want to say thank
you to the politicians and the economists,

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:11.569
that I feel that in a realistic way there
are enough answers founded and their reactions.

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:22.310
I'm impressed that a little depression is
feasible but at the end it's feasible to a

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:29.030
serious reaction. And I think the idea of
working world wide together in an institution

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:34.610
who is organizing the transfer of money, who
is controlling the money transfers and so

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:41.260
on, to work in this international institution,
this idea is born.. I think nearly in 10 years

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:47.890
we would have such and institution. I remember
the speech of Angelo American, she said as

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:57.450
a very strong nation, she's sure that the
states have to give some responsibility from

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:05.340
themselves to insure organization. And that
makes me a little bit optimistic because if

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:14.629
such an important and strong leader said that
she has to give the responsibility away then

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:20.719
I think it's a very strong message and I think
if other strong countries use this message

00:03:20.719 --> 00:03:22.790
then I think we will do much of things.

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:28.180
[pause]

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:36.810
The other thing which impressed me is the
idea that Mr. Schwab told several times, that

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:46.030
if you rebuild our economic system then we
are to use the chance to make it better than

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:55.489
before. It's not unnecessary to reorganize
it in the same way. Maybe this time we reorganize

00:03:55.489 --> 00:04:03.780
in a more ethical way, in a more serious way.
And so I think it's a good key message to

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.220
say we make it now better than before.

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:08.400
[pause]

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:14.719
And don't forget the third world, don't forget
the poor countries. I'm sure that it's necessary

00:04:14.719 --> 00:04:21.750
that if we have problems with money now then
we have to think about third world. It's necessary

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:30.180
not to stop the transfer of money to them.
I'm very impressed that Germany decided in

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:37.770
this situation to give more to the third world.
It's impressive. Yes we have come together

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:45.729
in Davos. Five days, five days we are together.
And I think we want nearly three years because

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:55.449
of all the important actors come together
and they can do a lot with in five days. They

00:04:55.449 --> 00:05:03.069
can get impulses in five days. They can get
ideas and strategies in five days. Normally

00:05:03.069 --> 00:05:08.949
I think we need for these strategies one,
two, or three years. And I want to say thank

00:05:08.949 --> 00:05:16.860
you to Mr Schwab who made it possible. And
I think every time we need one man saying,

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:24.039
ok there's the way we go there. And then we
all together go to there and find solutions

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:29.080
in which we have all together compromised.
Thank you very much.
