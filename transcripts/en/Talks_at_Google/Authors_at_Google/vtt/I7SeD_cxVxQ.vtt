00:00:00.859 --> 00:00:06.760
&gt;&gt;commentator: Hi all. Welcome to Authors@Google
in New York. And we're here to welcome Amanda

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:10.690
Pressner and Holly Corbett, two of the three
lost girls.

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:14.929
We sent out information about it. They have
a website and now they have a book and it's

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:20.800
soon to be made into an ABC show next fall,
I think it is by Jerry Bruckheimer. So we're

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.790
really happy to welcome them-them here.

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:28.880
And also one other note, there's a third lost
girl, Jenn, but she is actually I think working

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.279
with the Food Network on a shoot so she couldn't
be here today. But, so there's three, but

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.230
we're happy to have two of them.

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:40.730
So the three of these wonderful women in 2006
basically paused their jobs as they described

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:45.620
to me earlier and they wanted to travel the
world for a year. And so this book is just

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:51.230
a memoir of them traveling the world and what
it was like to kind of let go of their life

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:57.420
in New York and jobs, boyfriends, family,
and travel the world.

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.140
So welcome to them. And then Lee is gonna,
they're gonna read a little bit from the-the

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.700
memoir and then Lee's gonna moderate some
questions.

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:12.460
And feel free once we open it up to answer
questions at the mike. And please join me

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:19.040
in welcoming them to Google.

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.360
[applause]

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:26.140
&gt;&gt;Lee: Well thank you guys for coming.

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:35.270
&gt;&gt;Holly Corbett: Yeah, thanks for having us
here. We're really excited to be here at Google.

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:55.509
We kind of wrote up some things to say, but
we're pretty much just gonna ad lib so --

00:01:55.509 --> 00:02:11.570
&gt;&gt;Lee: We can have people if you wanna kind
of come like in from the sides and the back

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:20.000
row. I know you're gonna be on the computer
and that's kind of --

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.300
&gt;&gt;Amanda Pressner Come on in. Snuggle in.
[laughs]

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.000
&gt;&gt;Lee: people are working through their lunch
but --

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.379
&gt;&gt;Holly Corbett: Sounds great â€“ you guys
can bring your computer.

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:47.110
&gt;&gt;Lee: And probably later when we do questions
it might be easier just to pass the microphones

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:56.940
around so you don't have to stand up, if that's
cool. It would be easier to pass 'em if we're

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.190
a little bit more tighter knit, but --

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:11.000
&gt;&gt;Holly Corbett: Yeah, well just to give you
a little bit of background information about

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:19.310
us. I'm Holly. This is Amanda, and Jenn is
away working today so she couldn't be here.

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:31.530
But it was about four years ago, three and
a half or four years ago that the three of

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:39.700
us were working in media in New York. Amanda
and I were at magazines and Jenn was in television.

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:49.050
And we were working a lot of hours and it
wasn't that we were unhappy with our jobs;

00:03:49.050 --> 00:04:01.310
we loved our jobs; we'd worked really hard
to get there and-and to be working in magazines,

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:07.840
but we kinda started to feel like there was
more to life than sitting at our cubicle every

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:08.840
day.

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:14.580
And so as the months ticked by we kind of,
we started to get more baby shower announcements

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:16.989
and wedding invites and all this stuff ?

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:17.989
&gt;&gt;Lee: [chuckles]

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:24.370
&gt;&gt;Holly Corbett: and we were getting to be
in our late 20's and we just started to feel

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:33.520
some pressure to hit certain milestones. Like
find our soul mate, buy a home, have our kids,

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:37.650
and-and get a big promotion at work.

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:45.499
All of the time we were in our mid to early
30's so we just kind of started to-to feel

00:04:45.499 --> 00:04:51.430
that way and like time was moving really,
really fast.

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:58.409
So it wasn't until we actually got away from
work; we got to take a 10 day vacation which

00:04:58.409 --> 00:05:04.680
was really rare. Somehow the three of us managed
to do it. And we went to Argentina.

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:15.110
And it was when we weren't on autopilot anymore,
when we had more space and time for reflection,

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:20.619
that we started to ask ourselves some really
important questions.

00:05:20.619 --> 00:05:29.540
Wi-with deadlines hanging over our heads we
didn't really have a lot of time to think

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:31.889
about what direction we were heading in life.
So we started to ask, "Are the jobs that we're

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:35.210
at really the things that we wanna be doing?
What were we doing to give back? Were we in

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:39.680
the right city, in the right relationships?"

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:48.300
And so Amanda kind of threw out this idea
like, "What if we traveled for a year and

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:50.499
took a year long vacation?"

00:05:50.499 --> 00:05:57.149
So after that, we never really thought it
would happen, but the three of us kind of

00:05:57.149 --> 00:06:02.250
decided that, "Yes, this is something that
we wanna do," because we-we wanna stop living

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:07.659
on automatic pilot; we wanna get some space
and time for reflection. And for us travel

00:06:07.659 --> 00:06:09.059
was a really good way to do that.

00:06:09.059 --> 00:06:10.059
So --

00:06:10.059 --> 00:06:11.800
&gt;&gt;Amanda Pressner: Yeah.

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:19.449
So I didn't think when I suggested taking,
it's like a vacation fantasy you're-you're

00:06:19.449 --> 00:06:29.599
away for a week, you've escaped the office.
We managed to have 10 days of escape and we

00:06:29.599 --> 00:06:36.529
didn't bring our computers or BlackBerrys
or anything.

00:06:36.529 --> 00:06:42.939
And it was really like the most meaningful
10 days of my life and I was with these two

00:06:42.939 --> 00:06:47.509
really great women. And when I threw out the
idea to travel around the world for a year,

00:06:47.509 --> 00:06:57.270
I kind of never really considered that either
one of them would do it.

00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:08.169
But we all encountered these challenges in
our lives and for me it was, I, of the three

00:07:08.169 --> 00:07:15.089
of us I was definitely the most workaholic
type. I was at the office, I was working at

00:07:15.089 --> 00:07:19.979
a magazine which is where I met Holly and
I was putting in a ton of hours thinking,

00:07:19.979 --> 00:07:23.900
"At least this is like one guaranteed thing
in my life. That if I work really, really

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:27.309
hard, I'll get promoted and I'll keep moving
up the ladder."

00:07:27.309 --> 00:07:34.460
But I remember coming back from jury duty
one day and finding out that not only did

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:42.149
I not get this big promotion that I'd been
slaving away to get, I'd been put on probation

00:07:42.149 --> 00:07:49.050
because I hadn't come into the office after
jury duty, that I'm like, "What the hell am

00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:51.649
I doing? I've-I've gotta change something."

00:07:51.649 --> 00:07:59.129
And I went back to Jenn and Holly and said,
"Were you really serious about taking this

00:07:59.129 --> 00:08:00.129
trip?"

00:08:00.129 --> 00:08:06.149
And because of things they were going through
in their lives, their relationships that might

00:08:06.149 --> 00:08:16.399
not have been working out or just this sincere
desire to see more of the world, we all were

00:08:16.399 --> 00:08:17.679
like, "Let's do it."

00:08:17.679 --> 00:08:31.789
And we planned for 18 months. We saved; none
of us had a ton of money saved up, but we

00:08:31.789 --> 00:08:44.209
worked hard. Holly got a-a job writing a column
for a small magazine and on June 20th, 2010

00:08:44.209 --> 00:08:51.500
or 2006 actually, [laughs] we-we left and
we did this year around the world.

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:52.500
&gt;&gt;Holly Corbett: Yeah.

00:08:52.500 --> 00:09:01.000
&gt;&gt;Amanda Pressner: And-and then as far as,
as far as the Lost Girls name which you'll

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:10.000
see at the title of the book, we named ourselves
that kind of in jest because we really felt

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.800
lost about our futures.

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:17.880
And we knew from talking to a lot of other
young men and women that we really weren't

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:30.180
the only ones that felt that way and for us
the trip was about kind of pushing the pause

00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:39.490
button on-on the lives that we had to really
reflect and figure out what made us happy

00:09:39.490 --> 00:09:46.620
so we could make smarter decisions about our
futures when we got back.

00:09:46.620 --> 00:10:01.120
&gt;&gt;Holly Corbett: Yeah. I mean we-we feel like
the path to adulthood is-is no longer as linear

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:06.990
as it used to be like as our moms' generation
you tended to go to college, get married,

00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:14.040
have kids. And we have all these amazing choices
and all these things that we can do which

00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:22.130
is just incredible, but I think for us, we
just wanted to take some time out and be really

00:10:22.130 --> 00:10:23.779
mindful about like what we were doing.

00:10:23.779 --> 00:10:31.350
So for this, for the year that we went abroad
we got to live out our real life bucket list.

00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:38.040
We got to hike the Inca trail in Peru and
take surf lessons in Australia, and volunteer

00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:39.040
in Kenya.

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:46.380
And I think like the biggest, one of the biggest
things that we learned is that in New York

00:10:46.380 --> 00:11:02.350
we felt like time was just speeding, speeding,
speeding by and when we were on the road it

00:11:02.350 --> 00:11:10.990
was the longest year of our lives in the best
way possible. Time just seemed to really slow

00:11:10.990 --> 00:11:18.540
down and-and become bigger. And I think it's
because we were living really mindfully and

00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:23.930
everything was new so we felt like we were
a lot more present.

00:11:23.930 --> 00:11:39.170
&gt;&gt;Amanda Pressner: Yeah, and I think one of
the things that people ask of us and things

00:11:39.170 --> 00:11:51.350
we expected from ourselves from this trip
is that if we took this year off we'd better

00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:56.829
have some huge epiphanies about our lives
and-and figure things out, and that maybe

00:11:56.829 --> 00:12:00.529
somehow we'd be different by the end of it.

00:12:00.529 --> 00:12:06.949
But as we learned, taking this trip and going
to these different countries and meeting a

00:12:06.949 --> 00:12:16.040
million different people that the questions
that you have for yourself and the answers

00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:24.560
that you expect to get from traveling are
really never the ones that you ask.

00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:41.970
And if we could go back and talk to ourselves
when we were in our mid to late 20's and stressing

00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:47.089
about our futures, we-we might have told them
that eventually you kind of realize not to

00:12:47.089 --> 00:12:51.350
sweat the small stuff which is what we learned
on the trip.

00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:58.649
But I think if we'd, if we'd known that and
really accepted that, we might never have

00:12:58.649 --> 00:13:05.509
gone away and we wouldn't have traded our
trip around the world for anything.

00:13:05.509 --> 00:13:16.110
So we're really happy to be here to be sharing
the experience with you and hopefully the

00:13:16.110 --> 00:13:19.800
fact that you're here in the room means that
you on some level are interested in traveling

00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:22.440
and maybe even if it's just for a short period
of time.

00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:28.079
So we'd love to answer your questions today
and answer Lee's questions about the trip.

00:13:28.079 --> 00:13:35.680
&gt;&gt;Lee: Yeah, I mean you-you mentioned Amanda
that you met Holly at-at work. How did you

00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:49.610
meet Jennifer, like how did you guys realize
you had this common like frustration and then

00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:52.410
come up with the solution?

00:13:52.410 --> 00:14:00.310
&gt;&gt;Holly Corbett: It's funny. I didn't even
know Jenn before we took the vacation to Argentina.

00:14:00.310 --> 00:14:08.600
I think Amanda and I were in the office and
it was nine o'clock at night and she said

00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:17.189
that she was gonna take this trip with her-her
roommate, Jenn, and she knew Jenn from college.

00:14:17.189 --> 00:14:21.910
And she asked if I wanted to go and-and I
said, "Yes."

00:14:21.910 --> 00:14:27.040
And I charged the plane ticket and I think
they were kinda surprised, but that's-that's

00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:28.660
how it all started.

00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:29.660
So --

00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:33.120
&gt;&gt;Amanda Pressner: We were that desperate
to get away. [laughs]

00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:34.330
&gt;&gt;Holly Corbett: [laughs]

00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:35.730
&gt;&gt;Amanda Pressner: We were --

00:14:35.730 --> 00:14:37.959
&gt;&gt;Holly Corbett: We were like --

00:14:37.959 --> 00:14:41.029
&gt;&gt;Amanda Pressner: really excited. Yeah.

00:14:41.029 --> 00:14:50.920
&gt;&gt;Holly Corbett: So, yeah I didn't even know
Jenn before the trip. But we slept head to

00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:56.750
toe for a year so now we know each other really
well.

00:14:56.750 --> 00:15:06.790
&gt;&gt;Lee: I guess the bonding period was more
after the trip and it more just like you made

00:15:06.790 --> 00:15:12.310
the decisions independently and then went
on the trip together and that's what --

00:15:12.310 --> 00:15:13.639
&gt;&gt;Holly Corbett: Yeah.

00:15:13.639 --> 00:15:16.769
&gt;&gt;Lee: really kind of found like this common
thread.

00:15:16.769 --> 00:15:17.879
&gt;&gt;Holly Corbett: Yeah.

00:15:17.879 --> 00:15:23.660
&gt;&gt;Lee: Well and if anybody at any point, grab
a microphone, just jump up, pull it off the

00:15:23.660 --> 00:15:33.959
stand or you can stand at it either way if
you have a question feel free. Don't be shy.

00:15:33.959 --> 00:15:40.110
Well I guess tell me about I don't know, I've-I've-I've
traveled a lot myself, but I've al-, I've

00:15:40.110 --> 00:15:45.959
always traveled by myself so I-I feel like
it's in one way forces you to engage in the

00:15:45.959 --> 00:15:47.410
culture as well.

00:15:47.410 --> 00:15:55.459
Tell me about how you guys kind of reached
outside of yourselves as a group and engaged

00:15:55.459 --> 00:16:04.339
in the culture, and give me maybe a couple
of different examples of some places.

00:16:04.339 --> 00:16:13.010
&gt;&gt;Amanda Pressner: Well Jenn unfortunately
is not here, but it was always her dream to

00:16:13.010 --> 00:16:14.740
volunteer in Kenya.

00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:24.709
I think for me like I could barely just wrap
my brain around the fact that we were leaving

00:16:24.709 --> 00:16:29.869
to travel for so long. And fortunately Jenn
and Holly actually had some really amazing

00:16:29.869 --> 00:16:31.110
ideas of things that we could do.

00:16:31.110 --> 00:16:38.889
Holly wanted to go to an ashram and learn
to meditate and-and learn how to challenge,

00:16:38.889 --> 00:16:43.070
I don't know challenge herself in that way.
Jenn wanted --

00:16:43.070 --> 00:16:45.399
&gt;&gt;Holly Corbett: Quiet my mind.

00:16:45.399 --> 00:16:49.540
&gt;&gt;Amanda Pressner: yeah-yeah quiet our minds
a little bit.

00:16:49.540 --> 00:17:01.800
But the volunteer experience which was a month
for us; we went to a farm in rural Southwestern

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:11.410
Kenya and we showed up thinking, "Okay we've
signed up for this volunteer program. Great,

00:17:11.410 --> 00:17:20.829
give us some work to do. Give us some shovels
and give us something."

00:17:20.829 --> 00:17:26.750
And the volunteer coordinator who was a local
Kenyan was like, "Ah, there's no work today;

00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:35.850
maybe tomorrow." And that happened the next
day and the next day.

00:17:35.850 --> 00:17:46.270
We were baffled like, "What-what are we supposed
to do?" And we went into the school and there

00:17:46.270 --> 00:17:56.980
were already teachers teaching English. So
we really had to challenge ourselves at that

00:17:56.980 --> 00:18:03.179
point to find a way to contribute to this
community.

00:18:03.179 --> 00:18:11.260
And we were on the grounds of a school, but
we learned when we got there that there were

00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:18.050
12 preteen girls who had recently been moved
onto the grounds of this school because as

00:18:18.050 --> 00:18:27.640
they were walking there every day to go to
class, they were being attacked by local men

00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:34.320
who in some cases had committed acts of violence
against them.

00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:42.250
And so we realized that these young women
didn't have anybody really to talk to. They

00:18:42.250 --> 00:18:56.029
didn't have any mentors; there weren't counselors.
'Cause it really wasn't supposed to be a home

00:18:56.029 --> 00:19:10.050
and we decided every day to start working
with them and kind of drawing them out of

00:19:10.050 --> 00:19:17.500
their shells and playing games with them.
And eventually we started doing dance classes

00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:22.280
with them because that's a background that
I've had.

00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:29.950
And eventually we wrote a play with them called
The Tree Grows in Kenya and [laughs]

00:19:29.950 --> 00:19:30.950
&gt;&gt;Lee: [chuckles]

00:19:30.950 --> 00:19:35.250
&gt;&gt;Amanda Pressner: and that was kind of a
legacy we left with them.

00:19:35.250 --> 00:19:46.360
And by the time we-we said good bye at the
end of the month, we were all crying because

00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:50.169
we'd developed this tremendous bond with these
young women. And all of them, we'd seen them

00:19:50.169 --> 00:19:54.270
blossom and-and feel stronger and safer and
that has forever changed the three of us.

00:19:54.270 --> 00:19:59.930
&gt;&gt;Holly Corbett: Yeah. I-I think the places
where we stayed the longest were the places

00:19:59.930 --> 00:20:01.010
where we had the best memories.

00:20:01.010 --> 00:20:07.370
And that was probably in Kenya or in Peru
we stayed for awhile. We lived with Amanda's

00:20:07.370 --> 00:20:09.850
friend in Australia for awhile.

00:20:09.850 --> 00:20:19.840
So that was nice; we really got to know the
places, but I think it's different when you

00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:21.380
travel by yourself.

00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:22.400
&gt;&gt;Lee: Hum.

00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:29.080
&gt;&gt;Holly Corbett: I think people approach you
more because you're alone 'cause compared

00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:52.870
to three of us could be kind of intimating.
So I think when you travel with other people

00:20:52.870 --> 00:21:02.580
you kind of have to make more of an effort
to put yourself out there ?

00:21:02.580 --> 00:21:03.920
&gt;&gt;Lee: Sure.

00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:07.920
&gt;&gt;Holly Corbett: and-and talk to people.

00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:18.590
&gt;&gt;Lee: So tell me about when like-like it
sounds like it started off as trip, when-when

00:21:18.590 --> 00:21:31.769
did the, when did the blog come in? When did
the idea for the writing the book together

00:21:31.769 --> 00:21:37.550
come into play, and how did that come into
like the website you guys have now?

00:21:37.550 --> 00:21:48.460
&gt;&gt;Holly Corbett: Well, when we first took
off for the trip, Amanda is like our Web guru

00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:59.019
and she-she really wanted to keep in touch.
And originally we started the blog to kinda

00:21:59.019 --> 00:22:06.841
keep in touch with our friends and our-our
family back home, and that's kinda how that

00:22:06.841 --> 00:22:07.841
happened.

00:22:07.841 --> 00:22:19.299
But the blog kinda, Amanda can talk more about
this, but it kinda took on a life of its own

00:22:19.299 --> 00:22:34.100
because at first it was about us and our trip,
but when we came back there were so many other

00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:45.789
people saying, "Hey, I'm a lost girl or I'm
a lost boy. I wanna travel too," or "I've

00:22:45.789 --> 00:22:48.200
traveled. Can I share my story?"

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:55.250
So it kind of became -- it's not really about
us but other people who really just wanna

00:22:55.250 --> 00:22:56.830
share their stories.

00:22:56.830 --> 00:23:00.070
And from the blog, that's how the book came
about. Because a publishing company saw ?

00:23:00.070 --> 00:23:01.070
&gt;&gt;Lee: Oh.

00:23:01.070 --> 00:23:10.340
&gt;&gt;Holly Corbett: the blog and then asked us
to do a proposal and --

00:23:10.340 --> 00:23:24.899
&gt;&gt;Amanda Pressner: Yeah, I-I wanna add that
I'm not a Web guru compared to anybody in

00:23:24.899 --> 00:23:28.050
this room, but [laughs] --

00:23:28.050 --> 00:23:32.790
&gt;&gt;Holly Corbett: [laughs] We're at Google.

00:23:32.790 --> 00:23:36.299
&gt;&gt;Amanda Pressner: [laughs] Yeah. Yeah, but
I want, right when we were planning to take

00:23:36.299 --> 00:23:43.990
the trip it was the time we're blogging and
that platform had kind of just become the

00:23:43.990 --> 00:23:44.990
thing like where normal everyday citizens
could do it.

00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:55.529
And I knew that I wanted to have a way of
keeping in touch with-with friends and family

00:23:55.529 --> 00:23:59.710
and colleagues and letting them know what
we were doing and this just seemed like a

00:23:59.710 --> 00:24:01.350
really easy way to do it.

00:24:01.350 --> 00:24:06.220
It was a challenge trying to keep it up as
we were traveling though 'cause we were in

00:24:06.220 --> 00:24:08.680
countries where there was slow Internet, no
Internet.

00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:16.639
I remember going in Myanmar which was Burma
and getting to that country with Holly and

00:24:16.639 --> 00:24:25.049
Holly coming out of her room somewhere being
like, "Oh there's no Internet here." And I

00:24:25.049 --> 00:24:33.289
was like, "Oh you mean at this hotel? Well
let's just go find-find an Internet cafe."

00:24:33.289 --> 00:24:39.529
She's like, "No, in the, in the country."
[laughs]

00:24:39.529 --> 00:24:41.370
&gt;&gt;Holly Corbett: [laughs]

00:24:41.370 --> 00:24:42.370
&gt;&gt;Lee: [laughs)
]

00:24:42.370 --> 00:24:47.980
&gt;&gt;Amanda Pressner: And my jaw dropped for
like a good five seconds and then we realized

00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:55.210
in-in Myanmar, this freedom that we have here
to exchange information is-is so restricted

00:24:55.210 --> 00:25:07.110
that they actually have underground Internet
cafes where you go in and it's kinda like

00:25:07.110 --> 00:25:12.340
asking for other illegal substances. We're
like, "Hey do have ?

00:25:12.340 --> 00:25:13.390
&gt;&gt;Lee: [laughs]

00:25:13.390 --> 00:25:15.900
&gt;&gt;Amanda Pressner: do you have Google --

00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:16.900
&gt;&gt;Lee: [laughs]

00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:18.260
&gt;&gt;Amanda Pressner: do you --

00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:19.440
&gt;&gt;Holly Corbett: [laughs]

00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:25.430
&gt;&gt;Amanda Pressner: have Hotmail? And-and they'll
hook you up if you pay them [laughs] some

00:25:25.430 --> 00:25:26.430
money so --

00:25:26.430 --> 00:25:27.430
&gt;&gt;Lee: [laughs]

00:25:27.430 --> 00:25:33.620
&gt;&gt;Amanda Pressner: We eventually somehow kept
out blog going and we try-try to give ourselves

00:25:33.620 --> 00:25:39.320
the goal of posting once a week each one of
us.

00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:47.889
And like Holly said when we got back we had
this moment of like, "Do we keep this website

00:25:47.889 --> 00:25:49.409
going when we're not actually traveling?"

00:25:49.409 --> 00:25:55.990
But now at this point it has become such an
online portal for other young travelers who

00:25:55.990 --> 00:26:03.769
either want information, I mean Holly and
I come from a magazine background so we wanna

00:26:03.769 --> 00:26:12.130
bring as much service to it as we can, but
just knowing that other, there are hundreds,

00:26:12.130 --> 00:26:18.700
thousands of other young people out there
who have taken a risk, who've left their jobs

00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:26.429
to travel; have traveled after school; and
who wanna make it a part of their lives.

00:26:26.429 --> 00:26:36.110
We felt like we kind of just had to turn this
over to them and keep it going.

00:26:36.110 --> 00:26:47.210
&gt;&gt;Lee: You bring up an interesting point about
traveling or leaving your job to travel or

00:26:47.210 --> 00:26:54.200
traveling after school, so kind of a two-part
question about I guess the-the money behind

00:26:54.200 --> 00:27:04.820
traveling or saving or do you think it's in
your experience wise to travel after school

00:27:04.820 --> 00:27:12.270
or to start your career or do you think it's
different to, unique to the individual or?

00:27:12.270 --> 00:27:15.669
&gt;&gt;Amanda Pressner: Want me to answer that?

00:27:15.669 --> 00:27:16.679
&gt;&gt;Holly Corbett: Yeah.

00:27:16.679 --> 00:27:22.830
&gt;&gt;Amanda Pressner: Yeah, I think, I think
we've kind of determined that there are few

00:27:22.830 --> 00:27:33.260
times in your life where maybe it makes more
sense to travel. If you are reading the papers

00:27:33.260 --> 00:27:40.009
these days, going online, you'll see that
there's a big popularity for a gap year which

00:27:40.009 --> 00:27:45.309
technically is the year between high school
and college that people in other countries

00:27:45.309 --> 00:27:50.330
in the UK and Europe, that's a time where
young people will travel.

00:27:50.330 --> 00:28:00.389
Here in this country we do study abroad. Sometimes
people travel after college, but it kind of

00:28:00.389 --> 00:28:13.700
gets sticky once you're in the working world.
You're like, "Well when do I leave? Am I gonna

00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:27.679
commit career suicide if I, if I travel? What
will my bosses think? I'll have this hole

00:28:27.679 --> 00:28:30.159
in my resume."

00:28:30.159 --> 00:28:43.370
But we've found and we've had now several
other friends who've left to travel and I'm

00:28:43.370 --> 00:28:55.299
not necessarily encouraging that 'cause Google's
such a great place to work from what I heard.

00:28:55.299 --> 00:29:04.360
But that it's really not -- you do not sacrifice
everything else in your resume when you decide

00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:06.550
to leave to travel.

00:29:06.550 --> 00:29:14.440
The-the experience that we had when we came
back in was that people were really impressed

00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:23.230
that we'd taken such a risk and we volunteered
when we were away; we worked while we were

00:29:23.230 --> 00:29:24.230
away; and we were able to build other skills.

00:29:24.230 --> 00:29:31.730
So I really think that now if travel's something
that's important to you, you can absolutely

00:29:31.730 --> 00:29:34.500
find a way to make it work.

00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:41.419
We do think it's a good idea to have a few
years of work experience like two or three

00:29:41.419 --> 00:29:52.919
at least so that you can come back and say,
"I've been in the working world and I wanna

00:29:52.919 --> 00:29:54.179
come back."

00:29:54.179 --> 00:29:56.700
&gt;&gt;Lee: Wanna come back.

00:29:56.700 --> 00:30:16.360
Risk taking I think is something we value
here. It may be painful for your manager probably

00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:32.970
in the meantime to figure out for someone
to deal with the workload, but ultimately

00:30:32.970 --> 00:30:48.250
they are like, "Oh wow, like I wish I could
do that or have the strength to do that."

00:30:48.250 --> 00:30:52.320
Which is I think is very commendable.

00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:53.480
In fact ?

00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:55.230
&gt;&gt;Amanda Pressner: [chuckles]

00:30:55.230 --> 00:31:04.460
&gt;&gt;Lee: I think I'm gonna go catch a plane
and I'm gonna get out of here.

00:31:04.460 --> 00:31:07.100
&gt;&gt;Holly Corbett: [laughs]

00:31:07.100 --> 00:31:09.740
&gt;&gt;Amanda Pressner: [laughs]

00:31:09.740 --> 00:31:10.740
&gt;&gt;Lee: [laughs]

00:31:10.740 --> 00:31:28.059
I feel like I need a, need a, need to get
out of this office every once in awhile.

00:31:28.059 --> 00:31:31.230
&gt;&gt;Holly Corbett: [laughs]

00:31:31.230 --> 00:31:38.960
&gt;&gt;Lee: We probably all feel like that.

00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:47.380
So I mean I guess with, let's say we don't
wanna leave our jobs or we don't have the

00:31:47.380 --> 00:31:54.769
opportunity to travel for-for several months
and let's say we have to deal with our normal

00:31:54.769 --> 00:32:00.841
vacation period, three or, three weeks or
four weeks. Do you feel like -- how do you

00:32:00.841 --> 00:32:07.200
best maximize your time even though you're
still trying to find that balance or maybe

00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:10.330
working up towards a longer trip?

00:32:10.330 --> 00:32:19.309
&gt;&gt;Holly Corbett: Well I think you don't have
to do something as drastic as we did and quit

00:32:19.309 --> 00:32:26.960
your jobs and backpack around the world for
a year. I think one of the things that we

00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:33.690
brought back from our trip is how to kinda
get lost doing the things we love in our everyday

00:32:33.690 --> 00:32:40.929
life. And-and we realize that a lot of the
pressure that we were putting on ourselves

00:32:40.929 --> 00:32:41.929
to achieve and-and --

00:32:41.929 --> 00:32:42.929
&gt;&gt;Lee: Uh-hum.

00:32:42.929 --> 00:32:47.200
&gt;&gt;Holly Corbett: get promotions and putting
all our energy into the work wasn't coming

00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:53.370
from our bosses or our friends or our parents.
It was coming from ourselves. And it took

00:32:53.370 --> 00:32:59.799
us to take that trip in order to realize we
have to make fun a priority; we have to make

00:32:59.799 --> 00:33:02.100
following our passions a priority.

00:33:02.100 --> 00:33:05.730
So I think for people who have two weeks'
vacation if they can get away for two weeks,

00:33:05.730 --> 00:33:15.919
maybe kind of volunteer somewhere to get a
different perspective or go to cooking school

00:33:15.919 --> 00:33:27.690
if that's something that you've wanted, wanna
be doing.

00:33:27.690 --> 00:33:40.250
I think that rather than just vegging out
'cause a lot of times we do need it 'cause

00:33:40.250 --> 00:34:03.179
we're working so hard, but it's good to use
our time off to kind of dabble in other things

00:34:03.179 --> 00:34:08.310
that we're interested in. And I think ?

00:34:08.310 --> 00:34:09.310
&gt;&gt;Lee: Um-hum.

00:34:09.310 --> 00:34:14.130
&gt;&gt;Holly Corbett: that's how you get the most
out of your time off.

00:34:14.130 --> 00:34:16.530
&gt;&gt;Lee: Yeah. That's true.

00:34:16.530 --> 00:34:29.790
&gt;&gt;Amanda Pressner: And I would add not to
be afraid to travel by yourself. I think that

00:34:29.790 --> 00:34:43.930
that's really a time where you learn so much
about yourself and you-you challenge yourself

00:34:43.930 --> 00:34:54.250
in a way that you might not do here when you
have your friends and family around you.

00:34:54.250 --> 00:35:00.450
So if you have a week, do something structured;
volunteer, go to language school, or cooking

00:35:00.450 --> 00:35:01.690
school as Holly --

00:35:01.690 --> 00:35:03.450
&gt;&gt;Lee: Um-hum.

00:35:03.450 --> 00:35:08.740
&gt;&gt;Amanda Pressner: suggested. And just go.

00:35:08.740 --> 00:35:10.500
&gt;&gt;Lee: Yeah.

00:35:10.500 --> 00:35:21.040
&gt;&gt;female in audience: Can you describe the
moment when you told your friends, colleagues,

00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:26.950
and boyfriends that you were leaving? Like
[chuckles] if we were a fly on the wall [laughs]

00:35:26.950 --> 00:35:27.950
 --

00:35:27.950 --> 00:35:34.160
&gt;&gt;Amanda Pressner: Yeah. A lot of, lot of
people were shocked, but there was no -- I

00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:35.920
was really expecting people to be like, "What
the hell are you doing? Like you are crazy

00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:36.930
for leaving everything."

00:35:36.930 --> 00:35:39.090
But it, people really, there was some shock
and then people were like, "Oh my God, that's

00:35:39.090 --> 00:35:40.550
so cool. Like can I come? Can I carry your
bag?" Like people wanted to go. So --

00:35:40.550 --> 00:35:43.020
&gt;&gt;Holly Corbett: I was terrified to tell my
boss. I remember it was a Friday and I walked

00:35:43.020 --> 00:35:49.220
in the office, I had like everything I was
gonna say prepared and I waited all day because

00:35:49.220 --> 00:35:54.070
I loved my boss. She was like my mentor and
I didn't wanna disappoint her and I waited

00:35:54.070 --> 00:35:57.380
all day and finally at like 5:39, I knew she
was gonna be leaving soon. I ran into her

00:35:57.380 --> 00:35:58.380
office. And I was like, "Stephanie, I have
something to tell you." And she's like, "Oh

00:35:58.380 --> 00:35:59.380
my God. You're leaving us." And I'm like,
"Yes." She's like, "Where are you going? What

00:35:59.380 --> 00:36:01.530
magazine?" I said, "It's not for another magazine.
I'm-I'm leaving to travel the world." And

00:36:01.530 --> 00:36:05.990
she kind of looked at me like, "What?" I'm
like, "Yes, I'm-I'm gonna take off with two

00:36:05.990 --> 00:36:19.230
of my friends and-and I'm gonna travel for
a year. I've decided that I'm not married,

00:36:19.230 --> 00:36:24.450
I don't have kids, it's now or never. I might
as well. I'll always regret it if I don't

00:36:24.450 --> 00:36:25.450
do it."

00:36:25.450 --> 00:36:26.450
So they were amazingly supportive. Like my
boss was so supportive. They even helped me

00:36:26.450 --> 00:36:30.550
write while I was on the road and-and gave
me a column in an online magazine or a smaller

00:36:30.550 --> 00:36:35.270
magazine which actually went under three months
later like a lot of --

00:36:35.270 --> 00:36:36.270
&gt;&gt;Lee: [laughs]

00:36:36.270 --> 00:36:38.100
&gt;&gt;Holly Corbett: victims in publishing.

00:36:38.100 --> 00:36:44.580
But yeah, people were very supportive. Friends
and family; our parents kind of thought we

00:36:44.580 --> 00:36:45.720
were nuts, but --

00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:47.620
&gt;&gt;Amanda Pressner: Boyfriends had more --

00:36:47.620 --> 00:36:49.521
&gt;&gt;Holly Corbett: they went with it.

00:36:49.521 --> 00:36:52.850
&gt;&gt;Amanda Pressner: trouble with it but --

00:36:52.850 --> 00:36:57.900
&gt;&gt;Holly Corbett: Yeah, boyfriends were --

00:36:57.900 --> 00:37:05.970
&gt;&gt;Amanda Pressner: They were like, "Oh great."
[laughs]

00:37:05.970 --> 00:37:07.990
&gt;&gt;Lee: [laughs]

00:37:07.990 --> 00:37:11.020
&gt;&gt;Amanda Pressner: Yeah.

00:37:11.020 --> 00:37:12.020
&gt;&gt;Lee: Oh.

00:37:12.020 --> 00:37:13.020
[pause]

00:37:13.020 --> 00:37:21.560
&gt;&gt;female in audience: I'm cur, oh. Hi, I'm
curious how you guys approached writing in

00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:31.930
a collaborative way 'cause it seems like you
would have had, even though you were traveling

00:37:31.930 --> 00:37:39.420
together, you would have had such individual
experiences as you were traveling --

00:37:39.420 --> 00:37:40.420
&gt;&gt;Amanda Pressner: Yeah.

00:37:40.420 --> 00:37:41.420
&gt;&gt;female in audience: so having not read the
book yet, how did you actually approach that?

00:37:41.420 --> 00:37:46.490
&gt;&gt;Amanda Pressner: I'd say that the blog actually
really helped with that. I think it was really

00:37:46.490 --> 00:37:50.070
inadvertent, but the way the blog got written
is if something happened in our lives that

00:37:50.070 --> 00:37:59.590
was really compelling we're like, "Oh my God,
I'm gonna, I'm gonna put something on the

00:37:59.590 --> 00:38:00.700
blog about that."

00:38:00.700 --> 00:38:10.210
So when like the time came to write the book
we already had this online record of things

00:38:10.210 --> 00:38:18.660
that were really meaningful to us and we sat
down once the book, we'd written the book

00:38:18.660 --> 00:38:23.910
proposal. We tried to, we tried to outline
it and story board it, and the biggest issue

00:38:23.910 --> 00:38:27.970
we had was really just figuring out out of
all these millions and millions of memories

00:38:27.970 --> 00:38:28.970
of what was important enough to include.

00:38:28.970 --> 00:38:29.970
I mean it's a pretty significantly [laughs]
thick book. So --

00:38:29.970 --> 00:38:30.970
&gt;&gt;Holly Corbett: We put a lot --

00:38:30.970 --> 00:38:31.970
&gt;&gt;Amanda Pressner: we didn't do that great
of a job narrowing it down, but yeah we all

00:38:31.970 --> 00:38:32.970
decided. There really was very little like,
"Oh no, I wanna write that chapter."

00:38:32.970 --> 00:38:33.970
&gt;&gt;Holly Corbett: Yeah.

00:38:33.970 --> 00:38:34.970
&gt;&gt;Amanda Pressner: We all kind of agreed.

00:38:34.970 --> 00:38:35.970
&gt;&gt;Holly Corbett: I-I think that too, we didn't
do a lot of journaling. I know when I travel

00:38:35.970 --> 00:38:36.970
alone I compulsively journal. I'll, I will
sit there and write everything down, but because

00:38:36.970 --> 00:38:41.670
we were traveling with-with three of us all
together we would talk a lot. So it was nice

00:38:41.670 --> 00:38:44.510
that we had a collective memory. Whenever
I couldn't remember something, I would call

00:38:44.510 --> 00:38:45.510
Jenn or Amanda.

00:38:45.510 --> 00:38:46.510
But I think we had been traveling together
for so long, I had never in my life spent

00:38:46.510 --> 00:38:47.510
so much time with two other people. I mean
everything from waking up to where are we

00:38:47.510 --> 00:38:48.510
going to breakfast to what are we doing today?

00:38:48.510 --> 00:38:49.510
I mean we-we tended to all sleep in the same
room; sometimes in the same bed because we

00:38:49.510 --> 00:38:50.510
wanted to stretch out our budget. And I think
that really helped in the collaborative book

00:38:50.510 --> 00:38:51.510
process because we were so used to how each
other thought and how we communicated that

00:38:51.510 --> 00:38:52.510
it was really easy to divide up the book and
the story line.

00:38:52.510 --> 00:38:53.510
&gt;&gt;Lee: And you like-like --

00:38:53.510 --> 00:38:54.510
&gt;&gt;female in audience: Did you write it in
one voice?

00:38:54.510 --> 00:38:55.510
&gt;&gt;Holly Corbett: No, three different voices.
We kind of played off each other. It's kind

00:38:55.510 --> 00:38:56.510
of like sometimes I say like a Jodi Picoult
novel where it's the same story told from

00:38:56.510 --> 00:38:57.510
a lot of different perspectives.

00:38:57.510 --> 00:38:58.510
So it's the three of our perspectives, but
we take different sections or different things

00:38:58.510 --> 00:38:59.510
that happened along the way.

00:38:59.510 --> 00:39:00.510
&gt;&gt;Amanda Pressnber: It would be, you would
think it would be confusing but a lot, and

00:39:00.510 --> 00:39:01.510
we were worried about that, but people who
read the book have said, "I was, I had to

00:39:01.510 --> 00:39:02.510
look down to see which one of you was writing,"
'cause our tone like really became very similar

00:39:02.510 --> 00:39:03.510
as the writing continued.

00:39:03.510 --> 00:39:04.510
But -- so I think it was seamless, hopefully
in that way, but completely different characters.

00:39:04.510 --> 00:39:05.510
&gt;&gt;Lee: Any like serious points of friction
while you guys were traveling like being so

00:39:05.510 --> 00:39:06.510
close were there moments, were there any like
big fights or --

00:39:06.510 --> 00:39:07.510
&gt;&gt;Holly Corbett: Of course there were. [laughs]

00:39:07.510 --> 00:39:08.510
&gt;&gt;Amanda Pressner: [laughs]

00:39:08.510 --> 00:39:09.510
&gt;&gt;Lee: Did it have a productive outcome or
were they just like getting through and-and

00:39:09.510 --> 00:39:10.510
coming up with a compromise?

00:39:10.510 --> 00:39:11.510
&gt;&gt;Holly Corbett: I think --

00:39:11.510 --> 00:39:12.510
&gt;&gt;Lee: Or was it just tensions were high and
you were just in a bad mood?

00:39:12.510 --> 00:39:13.510
&gt;&gt;Amanda Pressner: Want me to answer that?

00:39:13.510 --> 00:39:14.510
&gt;&gt;Holly Corbett: Yeah.

00:39:14.510 --> 00:39:15.510
&gt;&gt;Amanda Pressner: Yeah. I mean I think the
biggest point of tension was I was like the

00:39:15.510 --> 00:39:16.510
most adamant about going and leaving work
and I had the most trouble of the three of

00:39:16.510 --> 00:39:17.510
us of actually doing that once we hit the
road. Like I had my laptop with me, I want,

00:39:17.510 --> 00:39:18.510
I had the blog and then I was also like, "Oh
this is a great chance for me to freelance

00:39:18.510 --> 00:39:19.510
write and be a travel writer." And I just
couldn't let go of it.

00:39:19.510 --> 00:39:20.510
And Jenn, who's not here unfortunately to
share her point of view, is much more of a

00:39:20.510 --> 00:39:21.510
travel purist. She-she was saying, "Well we've
quit our jobs, we've left our lives, like

00:39:21.510 --> 00:39:22.510
if we're gonna do this year around the world,
let's do it. Let's immerse ourselves in the

00:39:22.510 --> 00:39:23.510
culture. Let's not put any filters between
us and the places that we're visiting."

00:39:23.510 --> 00:39:24.510
And for she and I that caused a lot of tension.
I mean Holly tended to be the peacemaker between

00:39:24.510 --> 00:39:25.510
us 'cause she could see both of our perspectives
being a fellow journalist, but also being

00:39:25.510 --> 00:39:26.510
a-a traveler and-and seeing both sides.

00:39:26.510 --> 00:39:27.510
So I think other than that though we really
were able to -- I think there were no divas

00:39:27.510 --> 00:39:28.510
in our group so we really focused on the good
of the whole, the good of the group. And really

00:39:28.510 --> 00:39:29.510
in that way learned to be very unselfish and
to be very in tune to, "Holly seems like she

00:39:29.510 --> 00:39:30.510
might be a little space today. Let's let her
have like the morning by herself, and come

00:39:30.510 --> 00:39:31.510
back." We weren't perfect but we really did
learn to read each other's signs. And in some

00:39:31.510 --> 00:39:32.510
ways it was like a marriage, like you really
put the good of the whole versus the good,

00:39:32.510 --> 00:39:33.510
the good of you. And --

00:39:33.510 --> 00:39:34.510
&gt;&gt;Lee: Um-hum.

00:39:34.510 --> 00:39:35.510
&gt;&gt;Amanda Pressner: that's how we survived.
[chuckles]

00:39:35.510 --> 00:39:36.510
&gt;&gt;Holly Corbett: Yeah.

00:39:36.510 --> 00:39:37.510
&gt;&gt;Amanda Pressner: Yeah.

00:39:37.510 --> 00:39:38.510
&gt;&gt;Holly Corbett: Defintely.

00:39:38.510 --> 00:39:39.510
I --

00:39:39.510 --> 00:39:40.510
&gt;&gt;Lee: Any stories come to mind?

00:39:40.510 --> 00:39:41.510
&gt;&gt;Holly Corbett: Yeah. I'm trying to think,
I think that it was, it was like a lot about,

00:39:41.510 --> 00:39:42.510
a lot about compromise and just really learning
how to compromise. And the beauty is that

00:39:42.510 --> 00:39:43.510
we had three people. So if you wanted some
alone time, you didn't feel like you were

00:39:43.510 --> 00:39:44.510
leaving the other person by themselves.

00:39:44.510 --> 00:39:45.510
&gt;&gt;Lee: Right.

00:39:45.510 --> 00:39:46.510
&gt;&gt;Holly Corbett: So it was, three was a good
number for us.

00:39:46.510 --> 00:39:47.510
&gt;&gt;Amanda Pressner: Yeah.

00:39:47.510 --> 00:39:48.510
&gt;&gt;Lee: Yeah. It sounds like it; sounds like
it's a good combination.

00:39:48.510 --> 00:39:49.510
And I guess recently the rights were picked
up for, by Jerry Bruckheimer for make, turning

00:39:49.510 --> 00:39:50.510
this into a-a television series on ABC? Is
that, is that true?

00:39:50.510 --> 00:39:51.510
&gt;&gt;Holly Corbett: Yeah.

00:39:51.510 --> 00:39:52.510
&gt;&gt;Lee: What do you guys think, or what, I
mean I'm sure that's an interesting process

00:39:52.510 --> 00:39:53.510
to turn I guess any-any literary work into
a television series. But how do you see that

00:39:53.510 --> 00:39:54.510
or how-how would you manifest it?

00:39:54.510 --> 00:39:55.510
&gt;&gt;Amanda Pressner: Well I'm, obviously we're
hugely excited. Kind of couldn't believe it

00:39:55.510 --> 00:39:56.510
at first that somebody like Jerry Bruckheimer,
who's been in the business forever would be

00:39:56.510 --> 00:39:57.510
interested in this story.

00:39:57.510 --> 00:39:58.510
But I, we-we did think like, "Wow! This really
must mean that the sea change is upon us."

00:39:58.510 --> 00:39:59.510
And-and travel and hopefully stories led by
strong women -- that it will be fictionalized.

00:39:59.510 --> 00:40:00.510
It's not gonna be us on TV, thank God. They
will, they have hired a writer now to create

00:40:00.510 --> 00:40:01.510
the pilot for this.

00:40:01.510 --> 00:40:02.510
So it's not a hundred percent of a guarantee
that it'll air, but they already know the

00:40:02.510 --> 00:40:03.510
first country that they're gonna be shooting
in and we're-we're --

00:40:03.510 --> 00:40:04.510
&gt;&gt;Lee: Which is?

00:40:04.510 --> 00:40:05.510
&gt;&gt;Amanda Pressner: kind of overwhelmed.

00:40:05.510 --> 00:40:06.510
&gt;&gt;Holly Corbett: Australia?

00:40:06.510 --> 00:40:07.510
&gt;&gt;Amanda Pressner: Yeah, yeah I be, we think
it's Australia. So --

00:40:07.510 --> 00:40:08.510
&gt;&gt;Holly Corbett: It's really cool because
Jerry Bruckheimer does like The Amazing Race.

00:40:08.510 --> 00:40:09.510
So they have production companies --

00:40:09.510 --> 00:40:10.510
&gt;&gt;Lee: Right.

00:40:10.510 --> 00:40:11.510
&gt;&gt;Holly Corbett: around the world. So it'll
probably be set in a lot of different countries

00:40:11.510 --> 00:40:12.510
as opposed to ?

00:40:12.510 --> 00:40:13.510
&gt;&gt;Lee: Right.

00:40:13.510 --> 00:40:14.510
&gt;&gt;Holly Corbett: just filmed in the States.

00:40:14.510 --> 00:40:15.510
&gt;&gt;Lee: Yeah it seems like a good, to leverage
those resources and do little small things

00:40:15.510 --> 00:40:16.510
different places.

00:40:16.510 --> 00:40:17.510
&gt;&gt;Holly Corbett: It'll be exciting to see,
but it'll be very fictionalized so --

00:40:17.510 --> 00:40:18.510
&gt;&gt;Lee: Of course.

00:40:18.510 --> 00:40:19.510
&gt;&gt;Amanda Pressner: [laughs]

00:40:19.510 --> 00:40:20.510
&gt;&gt;Holly Corbett: It'll be much more adventurous
than we were.

00:40:20.510 --> 00:40:21.510
&gt;&gt;Amanda Pressner: [laughs] We might even
look very different than we did in the book.

00:40:21.510 --> 00:40:22.510
&gt;&gt;Holly Corbett: Yeah.

00:40:22.510 --> 00:40:23.510
&gt;&gt;Lee: [laughs] Naturally.

00:40:23.510 --> 00:40:24.510
Any other questions from anyone?

00:40:24.510 --> 00:40:25.510
&gt;&gt;male in audience: So this is a pretty vague
question, but I think you probably know how

00:40:25.510 --> 00:40:26.510
to answer it. Do you still consider yourselves
lost?

00:40:26.510 --> 00:40:27.510
&gt;&gt;Amanda Pressner: Yeah.

00:40:27.510 --> 00:40:28.510
&gt;&gt;Holly Corbett: [laughs]

00:40:28.510 --> 00:40:29.510
&gt;&gt;Lee: [laughs]

00:40:29.510 --> 00:40:30.510
&gt;&gt;Amanda Pressner: But we, I think we learned
by the end of our journey that the point really

00:40:30.510 --> 00:40:31.510
wasn't to escape being lost or to be found,
but it was really to embrace the idea of being

00:40:31.510 --> 00:40:32.510
lost, and that, really that feeling that you
have of not knowing a hundred percent where

00:40:32.510 --> 00:40:33.510
your life is going is a really positive one.

00:40:33.510 --> 00:40:34.510
That it means that you are capable of growing
and changing. And-and you're gonna start seeking

00:40:34.510 --> 00:40:35.510
outside of yourself to find ways to-to grow
and so that's what we tell people is like

00:40:35.510 --> 00:40:36.510
not to run away from-from that feeling but
to-to embrace it.

00:40:36.510 --> 00:40:37.510
&gt;&gt;Holly Corbett: And I think what-what I learned
during the trip is that a lot of times I was

00:40:37.510 --> 00:40:38.510
upset at myself for being restless and actually
I think it's a great thing. It's-it's a great

00:40:38.510 --> 00:40:39.510
thing to have that sense of, "Okay I don't
know what my future's gonna hold, but I am

00:40:39.510 --> 00:40:40.510
gonna live more mindfully; I am going to make
time for the things that matter to me." So

00:40:40.510 --> 00:40:41.510
 --

00:40:41.510 --> 00:40:42.510
&gt;&gt;Amanda Pressner: Yeah. Just to dwell on
it --

00:40:42.510 --> 00:40:43.510
&gt;&gt;Holly Corbett: We don't wanna get unlost.
We like it.

00:40:43.510 --> 00:40:44.510
&gt;&gt;Amanda Pressner: Yeah. Just to be more comfortable
with it 'cause one-once you start welcoming

00:40:44.510 --> 00:40:45.510
that feeling and-and knowing that it's gonna
come during periods in your life it's not-not

00:40:45.510 --> 00:40:46.510
nearly as scary.

00:40:46.510 --> 00:40:47.510
[pause]

00:40:47.510 --> 00:40:48.510
&gt;&gt;Lee: So what's next for you guys? I'm sorry,
go ahead. Go ahead.

00:40:48.510 --> 00:40:49.510
&gt;&gt;female in audience: That's okay actually
I'm curious about that question too.

00:40:49.510 --> 00:40:50.510
But I was just wondering on your travels and
I've travelled a lot too and I love traveling,

00:40:50.510 --> 00:40:51.510
so your story is very like inspiring to me.

00:40:51.510 --> 00:40:52.510
But was there any specific place that you
guys were individually where you said to yourself,

00:40:52.510 --> 00:40:53.510
"Oh, I could come back and live here?"

00:40:53.510 --> 00:40:54.510
Or like, "I'm so glad I did this trip because
I can totally see myself coming back here

00:40:54.510 --> 00:40:55.510
again," or something like that?

00:40:55.510 --> 00:40:56.510
&gt;&gt;Holly Corbett: My gosh, there were so many
amazing places. I think I never knew how beautiful

00:40:56.510 --> 00:40:57.510
the world was until we got off the plane in
New Zealand. It really was like Lord of the

00:40:57.510 --> 00:40:58.510
Rings territory with the-the mountains and
everything.

00:40:58.510 --> 00:40:59.510
So I really I loved New Zealand.

00:40:59.510 --> 00:41:00.510
&gt;&gt;Amanda Pressner: Yeah, I-I got a chance
to go to Laos which Holly unfortunately was

00:41:00.510 --> 00:41:01.510
in a different place --

00:41:01.510 --> 00:41:02.510
&gt;&gt;Holly Corbett: I was still in India in the
ashram. That was the only time that we split

00:41:02.510 --> 00:41:03.510
up during the year.

00:41:03.510 --> 00:41:04.510
&gt;&gt;Amanda Pressner: Yeah.

00:41:04.510 --> 00:41:05.510
&gt;&gt;Holly Corbett: I stayed for a teacher training
for yoga and they went to Laos.

00:41:05.510 --> 00:41:06.510
&gt;&gt;Amanda Pressner: There's so much of Southeast
Asia, it's an amaz - , if you guys are ever

00:41:06.510 --> 00:41:07.510
considering taking some time out to travel.
It's an amazing region to travel to for so

00:41:07.510 --> 00:41:08.510
many reasons.

00:41:08.510 --> 00:41:09.510
At first it's so culturally rich and you really
feel like you're traveling. You're not on

00:41:09.510 --> 00:41:10.510
vacation when you're, when you're there. And
it's also really affordable economically.

00:41:10.510 --> 00:41:11.510
Like once you get on the plane and arrive
there.

00:41:11.510 --> 00:41:12.510
I-I love Lao, they say Lao in-in the local
country 'cause it's French or Laos here, because

00:41:12.510 --> 00:41:13.510
they just opened it up to tourism not that
long ago and I feel like in other parts of

00:41:13.510 --> 00:41:14.510
Southeast Asia that are more touristed, you
kind of lose that sense of authenticity.

00:41:14.510 --> 00:41:15.510
But when I was there it's a beautiful country,
the people are very genteel and welcoming,

00:41:15.510 --> 00:41:16.510
and I really felt like I got an opportunity
to immerse myself in that culture almost more

00:41:16.510 --> 00:41:17.510
than anywhere else that I went. So I'd love
to go back.

00:41:17.510 --> 00:41:18.510
&gt;&gt;Holly Corbett: And we actually realized
we didn't tell you exactly where we went.

00:41:18.510 --> 00:41:19.510
We-we left Europe out of it because we wanted
to travel on about 30 dollars a day and like

00:41:19.510 --> 00:41:20.510
Africa, Southeast Asia, South America were
a lot cheaper.

00:41:20.510 --> 00:41:21.510
So we started out; we left New York; we went
to Peru, Bolivia, Brazil, Kenya, India. Then

00:41:21.510 --> 00:41:22.510
we kind of hop scotched around Southeast Asia;
went to Bali, New Zealand, Australia, which

00:41:22.510 --> 00:41:23.510
ate up --

00:41:23.510 --> 00:41:24.510
&gt;&gt;Amanda Pressner: All the rest of our money.

00:41:24.510 --> 00:41:25.510
&gt;&gt;Holly Corbett: any remaining budget and
came back home.

00:41:25.510 --> 00:41:26.510
&gt;&gt;Amanda Pressner: Yeah.

00:41:26.510 --> 00:41:27.510
[pause]

00:41:27.510 --> 00:41:28.510
&gt;&gt;Lee: Any other questions?

00:41:28.510 --> 00:41:29.510
Yeah.

00:41:29.510 --> 00:41:30.510
&gt;&gt;female in audience: I'm curious what your
reentry process was like. A, what you are

00:41:30.510 --> 00:41:31.510
doing now and B, how quickly if you guys are
back in the corporate world, how quickly you

00:41:31.510 --> 00:41:32.510
got wrapped up in the rat race again?

00:41:32.510 --> 00:41:33.510
&gt;&gt;Holly Corbett: Oh we learned that just because
we come back, the same stresses and the same

00:41:33.510 --> 00:41:34.510
pressures that we left behind were still there,
but how we reacted to them was very different.

00:41:34.510 --> 00:41:35.510
I think travel made us a lot more resilient
and-and we -- maybe a little bit more braver

00:41:35.510 --> 00:41:36.510
because surprisingly when we came back we
actually had more job offers then even before

00:41:36.510 --> 00:41:37.510
we left which really surprised us 'cause we
thought that we might have looked like slackers

00:41:37.510 --> 00:41:38.510
for kind of taking off and vagabonding.

00:41:38.510 --> 00:41:39.510
But actually people were really our bosses
and-and people in the industry were really

00:41:39.510 --> 00:41:40.510
supportive.

00:41:40.510 --> 00:41:41.510
But rather than take a full time desk job
like we normally probably would have, at least

00:41:41.510 --> 00:41:42.510
for me I stayed free lance which is again
not very safe. There's not the steady income

00:41:42.510 --> 00:41:43.510
but it was something that allowed me to still
be working, generating income, be creative,

00:41:43.510 --> 00:41:44.510
but have more time for the other things that
I, that I love doing. So --

00:41:44.510 --> 00:41:45.510
&gt;&gt;Amanda Pressner: I was fortunate I'd kept
up with some contacts that I'd been freelancing

00:41:45.510 --> 00:41:46.510
for before I left and got an offer about six
weeks after coming home for a much higher

00:41:46.510 --> 00:41:47.510
level position.

00:41:47.510 --> 00:41:48.510
I was the senior nutrition editor at Shape
Magazine and it was a job that I felt like

00:41:48.510 --> 00:41:49.510
I couldn't turn down. Like I had the urge
to just freelance like Holly to slow that

00:41:49.510 --> 00:41:50.510
transition, but I'd been an assistant before
and like it's too big of a jump, it's too

00:41:50.510 --> 00:41:51.510
good of an offer not to do. And so I definitely
struggled sitting back at the desk.

00:41:51.510 --> 00:41:52.510
I remember like Holly had said, our year was
so long because it was so rich with experiences,

00:41:52.510 --> 00:41:53.510
and I would get really forlorn those first
few months when I was still at the office

00:41:53.510 --> 00:41:54.510
at nine o'clock thinking, "Oh my God, an entire
day of my life has gone by and I haven't experienced

00:41:54.510 --> 00:41:55.510
it. I've been staring at my computer screen
all day."

00:41:55.510 --> 00:41:56.510
So I think what the trip did for me was it
made me less afraid to go in and address that

00:41:56.510 --> 00:41:57.510
issue with my boss. I think we're all really
afraid sometimes of we don't wanna look like

00:41:57.510 --> 00:41:58.510
the person who doesn't wanna work hard.

00:41:58.510 --> 00:41:59.510
But I-I was able to address that. I was able
to make some changes and was able to go three

00:41:59.510 --> 00:42:00.510
days a week at the magazine which was kind
of unusual.

00:42:00.510 --> 00:42:01.510
But I think because I'd had this trip experience
my editor-in-chief knew that I kinda meant

00:42:01.510 --> 00:42:02.510
business and that if I wasn't happy I wasn't
gonna force myself to stay. I was gonna find

00:42:02.510 --> 00:42:03.510
a job situation that worked better.

00:42:03.510 --> 00:42:04.510
It's not always possible, but I think we've
all kind of taken that commitment to really

00:42:04.510 --> 00:42:05.510
living our lives in the moment as much as
possible like through to this day. So --

00:42:05.510 --> 00:42:06.510
&gt;&gt;Lee: It seems like the confidence is certainly
 ?

00:42:06.510 --> 00:42:07.510
[pause]

00:42:07.510 --> 00:42:08.510
I mean it certainly has its, I mean I don't
know, I mean you could, it's effective in

00:42:08.510 --> 00:42:09.510
the workplace to be, to be respected and to
be, to have that kind of strength. I don't

00:42:09.510 --> 00:42:10.510
know it just kind of --

00:42:10.510 --> 00:42:11.510
&gt;&gt;Holly Corbett: Yeah, I think it's just you
don't have to be so afraid to ask for what

00:42:11.510 --> 00:42:12.510
you want and I think before, we were more
intimidated about asking for what we wanted.

00:42:12.510 --> 00:42:13.510
And-and if you don't ask, you're not gonna
get it. And sometimes when you do ask you're

00:42:13.510 --> 00:42:14.510
not gonna get it, but I think you feel better
about yourself because you-you tried.

00:42:14.510 --> 00:42:15.510
&gt;&gt;Lee: Um-hum.

00:42:15.510 --> 00:42:16.510
&gt;&gt;Holly Corbett: And I think that-that's kind
of the approach we took when we came back

00:42:16.510 --> 00:42:17.510
from the trip.

00:42:17.510 --> 00:42:18.510
&gt;&gt;Lee: Any other questions? I think we have
time for one more perhaps.

00:42:18.510 --> 00:42:19.510
[pause]

00:42:19.510 --> 00:42:20.510
&gt;&gt;female in audience: I'm curious to know
how often you travel now. Have you found that

00:42:20.510 --> 00:42:21.510
you have an even longer list of places you
wanna visit or you think, "Ah, I've seen a

00:42:21.510 --> 00:42:22.510
lot. Maybe I'll take it easy and not leave
as often?"

00:42:22.510 --> 00:42:23.510
&gt;&gt;Holly Corbett: I think it's funny 'cause
you think the more places you travel the shorter

00:42:23.510 --> 00:42:24.510
your travel wish list is gonna get, but it
just keeps getting longer the more places

00:42:24.510 --> 00:42:25.510
you wanna go. Or the more places you go, the
more places you wanna see.

00:42:25.510 --> 00:42:26.510
And we made a pact, the three of us, to take
a trip together once a year every year for

00:42:26.510 --> 00:42:27.510
the rest of our lives.

00:42:27.510 --> 00:42:28.510
So we've been doing that. We just went to
Napa. So we're trying to do more places in

00:42:28.510 --> 00:42:29.510
the States. And last year we went to Panama.

00:42:29.510 --> 00:42:30.510
But yeah, we try to, we try to travel whenever
we can. But we don't feel that desperate need

00:42:30.510 --> 00:42:31.510
for a break like we used to because I think
we've learned to just better balance our lives.

00:42:31.510 --> 00:42:32.510
&gt;&gt;Amanda Pressner: Yeah, it is still hard.
I-I think definitely one thing we learned

00:42:32.510 --> 00:42:33.510
from this is you-you don't come home and all
your problems are solved and you suddenly

00:42:33.510 --> 00:42:34.510
have vacation time galore. Like it is really
hard to still find the time to travel and

00:42:34.510 --> 00:42:35.510
we'll do, we'll do a lot of weekend stuff.
But getting the three of us to find one week

00:42:35.510 --> 00:42:36.510
that works for everybody is-is still really
difficult.

00:42:36.510 --> 00:42:37.510
It has to be a priority which is why we set
that-that goal of-of traveling together once

00:42:37.510 --> 00:42:38.510
a year.

00:42:38.510 --> 00:42:39.510
I think we really wanna go to the Philippines
next.

00:42:39.510 --> 00:42:40.510
&gt;&gt;Holly Corbett: Yes.

00:42:40.510 --> 00:42:41.510
&gt;&gt;Amanda Pressner: That's, we wanna scuba
dive.

00:42:41.510 --> 00:42:42.510
&gt;&gt;Lee: [laughs]

00:42:42.510 --> 00:42:43.510
&gt;&gt;Holly Corbett: Yeah. Tickets are expensive
in December, though; seventeen hundred dollars

00:42:43.510 --> 00:42:44.510
so we have to find a cheaper time --

00:42:44.510 --> 00:42:45.510
&gt;&gt;Amanda Pressner: Find a cheaper time to
go.

00:42:45.510 --> 00:42:46.510
&gt;&gt;Holly Corbett: Yeah.

00:42:46.510 --> 00:42:47.510
&gt;&gt;Lee: So are you guys working on any projects
together? What's next for you guys?

00:42:47.510 --> 00:42:48.510
&gt;&gt;Holly Corbett: Yeah, we're actually well
we're working on a second book, "How to Get

00:42:48.510 --> 00:42:49.510
Lost", which is gonna be more of a guide like
how to budget, how to save.

00:42:49.510 --> 00:42:50.510
And also we're-we're working on kind of like
a philanthropy part of the site. We are starting

00:42:50.510 --> 00:42:51.510
to organize Lost Girls races across the country.
So ?

00:42:51.510 --> 00:42:52.510
&gt;&gt;Lee: Um-hum.

00:42:52.510 --> 00:42:53.510
&gt;&gt;Holly Corbett: we're still in the process
of figuring it out, but we're trying to raise

00:42:53.510 --> 00:42:54.510
money to send nurses to school in Kenya because
we volunteered through Village Volunteers

00:42:54.510 --> 00:42:55.510
in Kenya so.

00:42:55.510 --> 00:42:56.510
&gt;&gt;Lee: Um-hum.

00:42:56.510 --> 00:42:57.510
&gt;&gt;Holly Corbett: We just kinda wanna get other
lost girls and boys together across the country

00:42:57.510 --> 00:42:58.510
and kinda networking and-and working together
for a healthy goal like a race and to use

00:42:58.510 --> 00:42:59.510
the money from the races to kind of send other
women to school to help them achieve their

00:42:59.510 --> 00:43:00.510
dreams.

00:43:00.510 --> 00:43:01.510
&gt;&gt;Lee: That's really cool.

00:43:01.510 --> 00:43:02.510
Anybody, one more question perhaps? We got
a couple of minutes.

00:43:02.510 --> 00:43:03.510
Yes.

00:43:03.510 --> 00:43:04.510
[pause]

00:43:04.510 --> 00:43:05.510
&gt;&gt;female in audience: [inaudible] How long
did it take to write the book?

00:43:05.510 --> 00:43:06.510
&gt;&gt;Holly Corbett: So --

00:43:06.510 --> 00:43:07.510
&gt;&gt;Lee: The question is how long, how long
did it take you to write the book?

00:43:07.510 --> 00:43:08.510
&gt;&gt;Holly Corbett: We didn't write it straight
through. We kinda tend to procrastinate. So

00:43:08.510 --> 00:43:09.510
 --

00:43:09.510 --> 00:43:10.510
&gt;&gt;Amanda Pressner: [laughs]

00:43:10.510 --> 00:43:11.510
&gt;&gt;Holly Corbett: I think we had for the first
draft a year to write it and I think we waited

00:43:11.510 --> 00:43:12.510
until nine months and we kinda, is that right,
crammed it --

00:43:12.510 --> 00:43:13.510
&gt;&gt;Amanda Pressner: Yeah, well it was hard
because we were all working again and writing

00:43:13.510 --> 00:43:14.510
a book is a lot more of an intensive process
than I think even I realized.

00:43:14.510 --> 00:43:15.510
So that was part of the reason I went three
days a week at Shape was I'm like, "The book

00:43:15.510 --> 00:43:16.510
will never get written if I don't start reprioritizing."

00:43:16.510 --> 00:43:17.510
So we started writing it really intensively
in August and got an extension and turned

00:43:17.510 --> 00:43:18.510
it in like at the end of March?

00:43:18.510 --> 00:43:19.510
&gt;&gt;Holly Corbett: Um-hum.

00:43:19.510 --> 00:43:20.510
&gt;&gt;Amanda Pressner: So it was probably about
eight months if I'm doing the math correctly.

00:43:20.510 --> 00:43:21.510
&gt;&gt;Holly Corbett: Yeah. And we-we, it took
us a long time I think 'cause we were used

00:43:21.510 --> 00:43:22.510
to magazine writing which is very different
from memoir writing and none of the three

00:43:22.510 --> 00:43:23.510
of us really knew what we were doing in the
beginning. So I think they say you have to

00:43:23.510 --> 00:43:24.510
write a hundred pages to find your voice and
I think I definitely wrote a hundred pages

00:43:24.510 --> 00:43:25.510
and --

00:43:25.510 --> 00:43:26.510
&gt;&gt;Amanda Pressner: Yeah.

00:43:26.510 --> 00:43:27.510
&gt;&gt;Holly Corbett: threw 'em away before we
got the first draft kind of done.

00:43:27.510 --> 00:43:28.510
&gt;&gt;Lee: So obviously being in publishing in-in
magazines what did you kind of think the future

00:43:28.510 --> 00:43:29.510
of publishing is going to be?

00:43:29.510 --> 00:43:30.510
&gt;&gt;Holly Corbett: Oh my gosh!!

00:43:30.510 --> 00:43:31.510
&gt;&gt;Amanda Pressner: Wow!

00:43:31.510 --> 00:43:32.510
&gt;&gt;Holly Corbett: If we knew the answer to
that question --

00:43:32.510 --> 00:43:33.510
&gt;&gt;Lee: [laughs]

00:43:33.510 --> 00:43:34.510
I had to ask. I had to ask.

00:43:34.510 --> 00:43:35.510
&gt;&gt;Holly Corbett: Yeah, I-I-I don't know as
far as like magazines going on -- online and-and

00:43:35.510 --> 00:43:36.510
things like that.

00:43:36.510 --> 00:43:37.510
&gt;&gt;Amanda Pressner: I would say that I think
we're in this experimental period with publishing.

00:43:37.510 --> 00:43:38.510
I don't ever think that print magazines will
entirely go away. I think that there is a

00:43:38.510 --> 00:43:39.510
tremendous amount of blogs and websites and
Twitter and-and so much information online

00:43:39.510 --> 00:43:40.510
and I think it's just an expansion period
and testing.

00:43:40.510 --> 00:43:41.510
And-and it will narrow back out again as it
doesn't become financially viable for writers

00:43:41.510 --> 00:43:42.510
to make one cent a word to write ?

00:43:42.510 --> 00:43:43.510
&gt;&gt;Lee: Right.

00:43:43.510 --> 00:43:44.510
&gt;&gt;Amanda Pressner: for a website. But I don't
think blogging will ever go away. I think

00:43:44.510 --> 00:43:45.510
people will always wanna express themselves
online. And if 10 people are reading that

00:43:45.510 --> 00:43:46.510
might be fine for-for somebody.

00:43:46.510 --> 00:43:47.510
&gt;&gt;Holly Corbett: Yeah.

00:43:47.510 --> 00:43:48.510
&gt;&gt;Lee: It's gonna get, I guess I mean 'cause
you guys were, I mean the book deal came out

00:43:48.510 --> 00:43:49.510
of the blog originally, right?

00:43:49.510 --> 00:43:50.510
&gt;&gt;Holly Corbett: Yeah.

00:43:50.510 --> 00:43:51.510
&gt;&gt;Amanda Pressner: Yeah.

00:43:51.510 --> 00:43:52.510
&gt;&gt;Lee: So it's been a way to kind of help
vet ideas and --

00:43:52.510 --> 00:43:53.510
&gt;&gt;Amanda Pressner: Absolutely.

00:43:53.510 --> 00:43:54.510
&gt;&gt;Holly Corbett: Yeah.

00:43:54.510 --> 00:43:55.510
&gt;&gt;Amanda Pressner: Like we learned what worked
and didn't work a lot really early on, I think

00:43:55.510 --> 00:43:56.510
from having the blog. When we started the
blog we wrote as a we voice like we didn't

00:43:56.510 --> 00:43:57.510
individualize ourselves and people were like,
"What is this?" Like, "Who's talking?"

00:43:57.510 --> 00:43:58.510
&gt;&gt;Holly Corbett: Who's talking?

00:43:58.510 --> 00:43:59.510
&gt;&gt;Amanda Pressner: So we-we learned to, that
it was okay for there to be three writers

00:43:59.510 --> 00:44:00.510
 -

00:44:00.510 --> 00:44:01.510
&gt;&gt;Lee: Right.

00:44:01.510 --> 00:44:02.510
&gt;&gt;Amanda Pressner: And we learned things that
were really controversial.

00:44:02.510 --> 00:44:03.510
There's a chapter where we write about prostitution
in one of the countries that we visited and-and

00:44:03.510 --> 00:44:04.510
we really were only in this area for a few
days. And writing about it when I wrote about

00:44:04.510 --> 00:44:05.510
it on the blog, people just, the comments
were horrible because here I was this outsider

00:44:05.510 --> 00:44:06.510
coming in and making social commentary about
a livelihood of a young woman in-in Thailand

00:44:06.510 --> 00:44:07.510
and it-it really made me, it really opened
my eyes and made me think, "Okay, before I

00:44:07.510 --> 00:44:08.510
write about something like this in the book
I really wanna do some research." And in that

00:44:08.510 --> 00:44:09.510
way I think it helped me to be a better writer
having a blog.

00:44:09.510 --> 00:44:10.510
&gt;&gt;Lee: Yeah.

00:44:10.510 --> 00:44:11.510
Well thank you very much for coming.

00:44:11.510 --> 00:44:12.510
&gt;&gt;Holly Corbett: Yeah.

00:44:12.510 --> 00:44:13.510
&gt;&gt;Amanda Pressner: Yeah.

00:44:13.510 --> 00:44:14.510
&gt;&gt;Lee: It was very, very interesting and I
think we gave some books to some, and they'll

00:44:14.510 --> 00:44:15.510
be willing to sign them if you wanna come
up afterwards.

00:44:15.510 --> 00:44:16.510
&gt;&gt;Holly Corbett: Yeah.

00:44:16.510 --> 00:44:17.510
Thank you guys so much for coming.

00:44:17.510 --> 00:44:18.510
&gt;&gt;Amanda Pressner: Thank you for coming.

00:44:18.510 --> 00:44:19.510
&gt;&gt;Lee: Thanks Amanda and Holly.

00:44:19.510 --> 00:44:19.511
