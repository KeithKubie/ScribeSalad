00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:17.699
The question of how long someone’s heart

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:28.100
would 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:47.199
have to be stopped for 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:50.429
before you can safely say that regardless
of what you do, you’re not going to be able

00:00:50.429 --> 00:00:52.909
to revive them is a very tricky question.

00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:56.819
It’s not as simple as saying after 10 or
even 20 minutes there’s no hope.

00:00:56.819 --> 00:01:01.149
For instance, there are countless people who
have been subject to hypothermia, have their

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:06.350
heart stopped for over 45 minutes, and still
have been successfully revived.

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:11.230
So many, in fact, that the current guideline
set by the American Heart Association (AHA)

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:15.600
is that you continue trying to revive the
person until their core body temperature is

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:23.250
above 95 degrees Fahrenheit- 95 degrees, because
below that is the technical definition of

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.250
hypothermia.

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:29.400
The mantra in that situation is, “They’re
not dead until they’re warm and dead.”

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.770
In other situations, numerous factors need
to be considered when deciding when to stop

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.140
trying to resuscitate someone, such as how
quickly CPR was started after their heart

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.460
stopped; how well CPR was performed (note:
CPR does not require mouth to mouth and recent

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:41.460
studies seem to indicate the person has a
better chance of surviving with just compressions

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.320
in most cases); the types of medications used
during the resuscitation; the medical history

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.680
of the person, known as comorbid factors;
and, finally, the cause of the cardiac arrest

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:48.990
in the first place.

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.980
With this in mind, let’s take a quick look
at some of the most common things to consider

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:58.120
when trying to resuscitate someone, and how
long you would try to revive them in those

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:59.120
situations.

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.240
The first, and most important thing to consider
is the point of trying to revive the heart

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:07.300
in the first place- that’s to supply the
body, and most importantly brain cells, with

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:08.470
adequate blood flow.

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:14.060
The first question any rescuer needs to consider
is, “What’s the likelihood that the victim’s

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.550
brain cells are still functioning?”

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:19.050
If there’s a good chance that if you get
their heart back going, the person isn’t

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.920
going to be a vegetable, you continue trying.

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.700
If not, you typically don’t.

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.560
For this, a general rule of thumb is that
brain cells begin to die after approximately

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.940
4-6 minutes of no blood-flow.

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.920
After around 10 minutes, those cells will
cease functioning, and be effectively dead.

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.270
That said, there are some exceptions to that
rule.

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:42.170
In situations of slow metabolism, like when
the person is hypothermic, those time-frames

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:43.310
are extended.

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.740
If good CPR is being performed, the brain
cells are also getting some blood supply,

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:52.860
although decreased, so the time frame is again
extended to the point the rescuer feels is

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:53.860
appropriate.

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:58.200
The second thing to consider is, “What is
the electrical function of the heart?”

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.930
The heart itself is a two part pump- one part
electrical, the other is plumbing.

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:08.270
The electrical part is mediated by electrolytes
like sodium, potassium and calcium.

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:13.680
The electricity created is what “shocks”
the heart and causes it to contract and squeeze

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:14.849
blood out to the body.

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:15.849
For a complete explanation of how this works
check out our article on How the Heart Works.

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:19.860
Any rescuer needs some sort of electrical
function to be happening within the heart

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.430
to be able to get the heart beating on its
own again.

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.270
Whether they need to externally shock the
heart, called defibrillation, or attempt to

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:32.209
create a steady beat externally, called “pacing”,
they do need some electrical function.

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:36.560
If there is some electrical function, and
good CPR was being performed (thereby continuing

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:41.380
to get some blood to the brain) most will
continue attempting to resuscitate.

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:44.490
If no CPR was being performed, then possibly
not.

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:47.960
No blood flow would have been getting to the
brain and thus after around 10 minutes, it

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:50.160
would be futile in most cases.

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.620
Unless of course you were going to attempt
the resuscitation for the purposes of providing

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.569
organ donation, then maybe.

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:02.209
Hopefully you are beginning to see why this
is such a tough question to answer.

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:05.870
If there is good electrical function and it
isn’t creating a heart beat, good CPR is

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:10.930
being performed, then continuing to try and
revive the individual would be a wise decision-

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:13.090
even if it’s been 45 minutes.

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:18.410
That being said, there can be good electrical
function and no heart beat, called PEA (pulseless

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:23.600
electrical activity) and if the rescuer feels
it has been too long for the brain cells to

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:28.530
survive, they might still decide to stop at
30 or even 20 minutes.

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:33.020
From this so far, you might be thinking to
yourself that it all comes down to the electrical

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:38.040
function of the heart- if it’s there, you
continue; if not, you don’t.

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:41.280
Unfortunately, that’s where this gets even
more complex.

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:45.910
Depending on what is happening electrically
within the heart, there are medications and

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:51.520
treatments that can be given in an attempt
to put the heart in a better pulse-producing

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:52.520
situation.

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:56.150
Let’s look at some of those situations and
talk about times.

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:59.900
The most common electrical rhythms the heart
can be in when it isn’t beating are asystole

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:03.760
(no electrical function), ventricular fibrillation
(the heart is quivering like a person having

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:07.580
a seizure), ventricular tachycardia (the bottom
part of the heart is beating really fast),

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:11.190
and PEA (anything that isn’t one of the
other three).

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:15.220
Before we talk about the types of medications
and treatments that can be attempted, and

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:22.000
the time-frames, I need to say that when someone
is in cardiac arrest, the absolute best treatment

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:59.900
known to man is good CPR compressions combined
with early defibrillation (see my article

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:02.900
on Top 5 Life Saving First Aid Tricks Everyone
Should Know).

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:13.720
No 

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:18.639
medication or treatment should ever be given
in place of those two things.

00:06:18.639 --> 00:06:23.850
That being said, if those two things aren’t
enough, there are some things a rescuer could

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:24.850
try.

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:27.889
When it comes to the medications given, you
have to take into account the time it takes

00:06:27.889 --> 00:06:29.060
for them to work.

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:34.370
This will vary greatly depending on CPR compressions
and numerous other factors like normal time

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:36.520
for that medication to be metabolized.

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:39.350
So the times I give are the best approximates
we currently have.

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:40.800
I also won’t be going into how they work
or why you would choose one over the other,

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.043
as this article is already pretty long.

00:06:42.043 --> 00:06:43.043
I will simply give you time frames for them
to work because a rescuer would need to continue

00:06:43.043 --> 00:06:44.043
attempting to revive the victim until that
time.

00:06:44.043 --> 00:06:45.043
Let’s start with asystole.

00:06:45.043 --> 00:06:47.931
Currently, the AHA recommends using epinephrine
or vasopressin combined with good CPR compression

00:06:47.931 --> 00:06:49.450
to circulate it.

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:53.340
Epinephrine begins to cause reactions within
about 1-2 minutes and begins to become less

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:55.600
effective around 5 minutes.

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:59.570
The AHA, thus, recommends giving a dose every
5 minutes of resuscitation.

00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:04.509
You would continue trying to revive the victim
with this drug until you felt the brain cells

00:07:04.509 --> 00:07:08.509
had no chance, or you had no change in the
electrical function of the heart.

00:07:08.509 --> 00:07:11.810
20 minutes is a common time frame.

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:14.479
Vasopressin takes approximately 20 minutes
to begin to cause a reaction.

00:07:14.479 --> 00:07:19.699
A rescuer would need to continue attempting
resuscitation for at least that long before

00:07:19.699 --> 00:07:21.050
they would expect a result.

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:25.820
20 minutes would then be the minimum amount
of time you would attempt resuscitation.

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:29.400
Some would continue longer, especially if
they had a change in the electrical function

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:30.850
of the heart.

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:36.720
Ventricular fibrillation and Ventricular tachycardia
are treated almost the same.

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:38.410
Externally shocking the victim is the treatment
of choice.

00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:43.790
Along with Epinephrine, the AHA also recommends
giving Amiodarone, and if that’s not available,

00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:44.790
Lidocaine.

00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:49.490
Amiodarone begins to work around 10-15 minutes,
Lidocaine around 2-5 minutes.

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:53.460
You would continue giving this drug until
you reached its maximum dosage.

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:57.770
With Amiodarone you use only one large initial
dose, followed by a smaller dose should you

00:07:57.770 --> 00:07:58.770
get a heartbeat back.

00:07:58.770 --> 00:07:59.770
With Lidocaine, you would give approximately
three doses.

00:07:59.770 --> 00:08:03.430
The time frame for this type of resuscitation
can be quite long.

00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:07.780
This is because all of those treatments take
time, and you could choose several different

00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:09.919
orders in which to give it.

00:08:09.919 --> 00:08:13.539
You would start with shocking the victim,
wait 2 minutes, then give Epinephrine, wait

00:08:13.539 --> 00:08:19.150
another 2 minutes, then choose Amiodarone
or Lidocaine, or any of the 4, and then continue

00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:20.180
from there.

00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:24.050
As long as the person is still in this rhythm,
you would continue.

00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:26.520
Should it change, you would then change your
treatment.

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:32.259
I will say, I have personally seen this rhythm
persist for well over 30 minutes.

00:08:32.259 --> 00:08:37.419
We then get to PEA (pulseless electrical activity).

00:08:37.419 --> 00:08:43.120
This is its own animal as it could be any
sort of rhythm that isn’t one of the others.

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:46.520
Because of this, the gold standard is trying
to fix the cause.

00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:51.930
For this, the AHA has a handy little mnemonic
called the 6 H’s and 5 T’s.

00:08:51.930 --> 00:08:56.950
The H’s are: Hypovolemia (not enough blood),
Hydrongen ion (acidosis), Hyper/Hypokalemia

00:08:56.950 --> 00:09:02.760
(high or low potassium), Hypoglycemia (low
blood sugar), and hypothermia.

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:07.640
The T’s are: Toxins (either drugs or chemical),
Tamponade (cardiac tamponade, meaning fluid

00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:12.790
around the heart), Tension pneumothorax (a
hole in your lung that progresses in to pressure

00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:17.870
on your heart), Thrombosis (clot or other
occlusion in your blood vessels), and Trauma.

00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:21.530
The treatment for each of those situations
takes its own amount of time.

00:09:21.530 --> 00:09:25.040
Some take as little as 1-2 minutes, like in
the case of fixing acidosis.

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:30.200
A person could give a drug called sodium bicarbonate,
or one could artificially breathe really fast

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:31.200
for them.

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:36.550
Some treatments can take well in excess of
an hour, as in the case of fixing hypothermia.

00:09:36.550 --> 00:09:40.740
Things can get even more complicated should
the victim begin to have several different

00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:41.840
heart rhythms.

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:46.420
In those cases, and with most cases, it really
comes down to whether or not the rescuer feels

00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:48.720
the brain cells are still viable.

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:51.190
That decision is very subjective in nature.

00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:55.540
One doctor or paramedic might not choose to
resuscitate someone when another would.

00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:59.520
Both could be correct in their decision, depending
on what they thought was the cause.

00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:04.100
With all of the specific treatments considered,
it really comes down to brain cells.

00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:08.580
If they could still be viable, you would continue
attempting resuscitation.

00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:10.770
If not, then you wouldn’t.

00:10:10.770 --> 00:10:15.670
General time-frames that are common in hospitals
and with paramedics are 20-40 min, should

00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:17.430
they choose to start resuscitation.

00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:24.000
But, even within those time-frames, they might
choose to not even try, depending on the situation.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:29.410
I know it’s not a concrete answer like “20
minutes”, but hopefully this was at least

00:10:29.410 --> 00:10:32.870
an informative and interesting read.

00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:36.740
From my many years of personal experience,
I can tell you that the longest I have ever

00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:41.300
personally seen a person’s heart not beating
and they were able to be successfully revived

00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:45.670
(meaning they walked out of the hospital with
somewhat normal neurological function) was

00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:47.040
over 40 minutes.

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:51.560
Luckily for that gentleman, he did have CPR
started almost immediately and advanced life

00:10:51.560 --> 00:13:01.100
support was started within 12 minutes.
