00:00:00.487 --> 00:00:01.641
Voiceover: What I want to do in this video

00:00:01.641 --> 00:00:05.641
is talk a little bit about
money and interest rates

00:00:05.641 --> 00:00:08.736
and do it in kind of a
microeconomic framework,

00:00:08.736 --> 00:00:10.404
so that we understand the relationship

00:00:10.404 --> 00:00:13.406
between the supply of
money and demand for money

00:00:13.406 --> 00:00:15.473
and the price of money, which we'll see

00:00:15.473 --> 00:00:18.405
is what interest rates actually are.

00:00:18.405 --> 00:00:21.306
Once we do that, then we'll
be able to be more fluent

00:00:21.306 --> 00:00:23.890
in discussing money and
interest rates and supply

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:25.557
and demand and price of money

00:00:25.557 --> 00:00:28.482
in a macroeconomic context.

00:00:28.482 --> 00:00:30.559
Maybe the most confusing thing,

00:00:30.559 --> 00:00:33.337
when you view money in
a microeconomic context

00:00:33.337 --> 00:00:39.141
is what is the price of money?

00:00:39.141 --> 00:00:41.472
You might already be
guessing the price of money

00:00:41.472 --> 00:00:43.404
is the interest rate.

00:00:43.404 --> 00:00:45.269
To understand that a little
bit better, the best way

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:48.056
to think about it is you're
not necessarily buying money.

00:00:48.056 --> 00:00:55.806
Interest is rent on money.

00:00:55.806 --> 00:00:57.937
If I said, "What is the
price of an apartment

00:00:57.937 --> 00:00:59.404
"in my neighborhood?"

00:00:59.404 --> 00:01:02.556
Someone might say a one-bedroom apartment,

00:01:02.556 --> 00:01:04.138
and that actually is
pretty close to the prices

00:01:04.138 --> 00:01:06.471
where I live, here in northern California.

00:01:06.471 --> 00:01:08.225
If you want even the most basic,

00:01:08.225 --> 00:01:10.069
one-bedroom apartment,
it's going to run you

00:01:10.069 --> 00:01:16.737
about $1200 per month,

00:01:16.737 --> 00:01:21.223
which is about $14,400 per year.

00:01:21.223 --> 00:01:27.975
We should say per apartment per year.

00:01:27.975 --> 00:01:30.559
This is essentially the
cost of your apartment.

00:01:30.559 --> 00:01:33.738
Now, if I went to the bank and I said,

00:01:33.738 --> 00:01:37.141
"Hey, I want to borrow $10,000."

00:01:37.141 --> 00:01:39.336
Maybe I want to buy a car or something,

00:01:39.336 --> 00:01:40.974
they would quote an interest rate.

00:01:40.974 --> 00:01:42.602
They would say, "Okay, you can borrow that

00:01:42.602 --> 00:01:44.671
"at an interest rate of -

00:01:44.671 --> 00:01:45.064
I don't know.

00:01:45.064 --> 00:01:46.585
Interest rates are pretty low right now.

00:01:46.585 --> 00:01:48.920
They'll say, "You can borrow
that at an interest rate

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.520
"at 5%."

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.063
To see that is essentially
the cost of renting money,

00:01:53.063 --> 00:01:57.216
we could essentially
just say that this is 5 -

00:01:57.216 --> 00:02:07.550
We could view this as
$0.05 per dollar per year.

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:08.997
Once again, when you're
renting an apartment,

00:02:08.997 --> 00:02:13.063
it was $14,000 per apartment per year.

00:02:13.063 --> 00:02:15.332
Now, at an interest rate of 5%,

00:02:15.332 --> 00:02:18.263
that is $0.05 per dollar per year.

00:02:18.263 --> 00:02:19.885
It's the exact same thing.

00:02:19.885 --> 00:02:27.463
This right over here is the rental price

00:02:27.463 --> 00:02:30.800
on the actual money that I'm borrowing.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.135
Once you have that in your head

00:02:32.135 --> 00:02:33.264
and you feel comfortable with that,

00:02:33.264 --> 00:02:35.598
now we can actually draw
a supply and demand graph

00:02:35.598 --> 00:02:37.465
and the microeconomics context.

00:02:37.465 --> 00:02:39.966
Now that we know how to
think about the price

00:02:39.966 --> 00:02:40.967
of money.

00:02:40.967 --> 00:02:45.397
Let's draw a little
supply and demand diagram

00:02:45.397 --> 00:02:48.716
right over here and we're
going to, like we often do

00:02:48.716 --> 00:02:51.135
in our little economic models we do,

00:02:51.135 --> 00:02:53.398
we're going to super oversimplify it.

00:02:53.398 --> 00:02:55.731
We're going to not think
about things like credit risk

00:02:55.731 --> 00:02:59.271
and the chances of probability
that people do pay back

00:02:59.271 --> 00:03:00.999
or won't pay back the
money and things like

00:03:00.999 --> 00:03:02.332
(unintelligible) and all of that.

00:03:02.332 --> 00:03:04.463
We'll just assume that
everyone is going to pay back

00:03:04.463 --> 00:03:06.936
the money and they're all risk free.

00:03:06.936 --> 00:03:09.730
They're all going to do
exactly what they said.

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.064
In this axis right over here, this is -

00:03:12.064 --> 00:03:24.931
Let's call this the
market for borrowing money

00:03:24.931 --> 00:03:27.664
for 1 year.

00:03:27.664 --> 00:03:29.373
As we'll see and you might already know,

00:03:29.373 --> 00:03:31.400
they'll have different
prices for borrowing money

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:32.733
for different lengths of time.

00:03:32.733 --> 00:03:34.730
I might charge you more
to borrow money for a year

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:37.800
than I would charge
you for borrowing money

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.289
for a month, because
maybe I won't have access

00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:42.957
to that money or there's a bigger risk

00:03:42.957 --> 00:03:44.664
that something might happen in that year,

00:03:44.664 --> 00:03:45.731
so I'll charge you more for it.

00:03:45.731 --> 00:03:47.064
I have to fix the year.

00:03:47.064 --> 00:03:49.800
The market for borrowing money for 1 year.

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.398
Most of these supply and demand graphs,

00:03:52.398 --> 00:03:54.957
the vertical axis, we have price, but now,

00:03:54.957 --> 00:03:57.731
as we just indicated, the price of money

00:03:57.731 --> 00:04:01.332
is really just the interest rate.

00:04:01.332 --> 00:04:04.265
I'll call this price, so this is our -

00:04:04.265 --> 00:04:07.998
Same yellow, so this is our price axis

00:04:07.998 --> 00:04:11.805
and it's measured as
interest rate percentage.

00:04:11.805 --> 00:04:16.207
Interest rate is how
we're going to measure it.

00:04:16.207 --> 00:04:19.799
This right over here, let's
say that that is 30% interest,

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:25.135
this is 15% interest, and
then this would be 10%, 5%,

00:04:25.135 --> 00:04:26.866
this would be 20%, 25%.

00:04:26.866 --> 00:04:27.732
Pretty good.

00:04:27.732 --> 00:04:30.532
Then over here we would
have the quantity of money

00:04:30.532 --> 00:04:32.266
and I'll just pick some values here.

00:04:32.266 --> 00:04:36.465
We could even say that that
is in billions of dollars.

00:04:36.465 --> 00:04:38.624
We could size it right, based
on whether we're talking

00:04:38.624 --> 00:04:41.665
about our town, our city, or
whatever, the whole world,

00:04:41.665 --> 00:04:42.198
or whatever it is.

00:04:42.198 --> 00:04:44.338
It depends on what
currency and all of that,

00:04:44.338 --> 00:04:46.008
but we're just assuming
that we're on some island

00:04:46.008 --> 00:04:49.674
with one currency and all the rest.

00:04:49.674 --> 00:04:53.592
Let's say that this is 1
billion, 2 billion, 3 billion,

00:04:53.592 --> 00:04:56.195
4 billion, and 5 billion.

00:04:56.195 --> 00:04:57.342
You can imagine, let's first think

00:04:57.342 --> 00:04:58.592
about the demand curve.

00:04:58.592 --> 00:05:02.124
We could think of it as
a marginal benefit curve.

00:05:02.124 --> 00:05:05.343
Those first few dollars
that are out to be lent,

00:05:05.343 --> 00:05:07.011
there are someone who is going to get

00:05:07.011 --> 00:05:08.850
a huge marginal benefit of it.

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:10.782
They want to take that,
either they want to borrow it

00:05:10.782 --> 00:05:12.450
and use it for some type of consumption

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:16.850
that they want to buy
that would make them very,

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:18.518
very, very happy, or at least
they think it'll make them

00:05:18.518 --> 00:05:20.426
very happy, or they want
to use it for some type

00:05:20.426 --> 00:05:21.924
of investment, where they're like,

00:05:21.924 --> 00:05:23.451
"Wow, if I could just borrow some money,

00:05:23.451 --> 00:05:25.450
"I have this no-risk
investment that's just going

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:28.117
"to make me a gazillionaire."

00:05:28.117 --> 00:05:30.118
Those first few dollars
there's huge demand,

00:05:30.118 --> 00:05:32.383
huge marginal benefit for you.

00:05:32.383 --> 00:05:34.924
You could use as a willingness to pay

00:05:34.924 --> 00:05:37.116
for those first few dollars is very high,

00:05:37.116 --> 00:05:38.594
so maybe it is way up here.

00:05:38.594 --> 00:05:40.676
People are willing to pay an excess of 30%

00:05:40.676 --> 00:05:42.451
for those first few dollars.

00:05:42.451 --> 00:05:43.783
Then, as there's more and more dollars,

00:05:43.783 --> 00:05:46.850
the incremental next borrower
gets a little bit less

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:48.840
marginal benefit from it.

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:51.518
You would have a declining demand curve

00:05:51.518 --> 00:05:52.677
that looks something like this.

00:05:52.677 --> 00:05:55.011
This is the exact same thought process

00:05:55.011 --> 00:05:56.785
as you would have if we were
thinking about the market

00:05:56.785 --> 00:05:59.184
for ice cream of if we're
thinking about the market

00:05:59.184 --> 00:06:01.261
for apartments or for anything else.

00:06:01.261 --> 00:06:05.392
This is our demand curve.

00:06:06.174 --> 00:06:08.174
When we think about the supply curve,

00:06:08.174 --> 00:06:14.383
same exact thought process
as we would for supply

00:06:14.383 --> 00:06:16.450
of any product.

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:20.052
Those first few dollars, the
people lending the money,

00:06:20.052 --> 00:06:22.924
there are probably people
there willing to lend

00:06:22.924 --> 00:06:23.720
for very little.

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:26.088
They have nothing else
to do with that money.

00:06:27.117 --> 00:06:30.212
Another way to think of it is
they have very little to do

00:06:30.212 --> 00:06:31.143
with that money.

00:06:31.143 --> 00:06:32.852
Their marginal cost of lending that money

00:06:32.852 --> 00:06:34.635
is very low.

00:06:35.212 --> 00:06:37.220
The supply curve might start over here.

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:39.468
People will start to be
willing to lend the money

00:06:39.468 --> 00:06:40.934
to very low interest rate.

00:06:40.934 --> 00:06:42.668
This looks like about 1%.

00:06:42.668 --> 00:06:45.386
Then, each incremental
dollar, the opportunity cost

00:06:45.386 --> 00:06:48.489
for that lender is going
to get higher and higher.

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:51.922
The interest for that
next incremental dollar

00:06:51.922 --> 00:06:54.064
is going to get higher and higher.

00:06:54.064 --> 00:06:56.231
We've now drawn the
supply and demand graphs

00:06:56.231 --> 00:07:00.145
for the market for
borrowing money for 1 year.

00:07:00.145 --> 00:07:01.167
This is right here.

00:07:01.167 --> 00:07:04.732
This is the supply and this is in billions

00:07:04.732 --> 00:07:09.320
of dollars per year.

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:12.653
This is how much is going
to be lent in that year

00:07:12.653 --> 00:07:15.320
and it's for borrowing money for a year.

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:18.320
As we see, we can view
money just like we can view

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:19.718
any other product.

00:07:19.718 --> 00:07:21.814
There's going to be an
equilibrium price here,

00:07:21.814 --> 00:07:24.253
an equilibrium quantity.

00:07:24.253 --> 00:07:27.147
The way I drew it right over
here, the equilibrium price

00:07:27.147 --> 00:07:28.730
and remember the price
of money is really just

00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:29.919
the interest rate.

00:07:29.919 --> 00:07:32.653
The equilibrium price
right over here is 10%,

00:07:32.653 --> 00:07:35.989
which you could view as
$0.10 per dollar per year.

00:07:35.989 --> 00:07:39.052
The equilibrium quantity
of money that gets lent

00:07:39.052 --> 00:07:42.934
and borrowed looks like it's about 2.7

00:07:42.934 --> 00:07:48.522
or 2.8 billion dollars gets
lent and borrowed in that year,

00:07:48.522 --> 00:07:49.770
in each year.

00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:51.398
When we look at it this way,
then we can start thinking

00:07:51.398 --> 00:07:53.899
about some macroeconomics phenomenon.

00:07:53.899 --> 00:08:01.453
What happens if all of a
sudden everybody in the world

00:08:01.453 --> 00:08:04.316
or in our little universe
right over here gets

00:08:04.316 --> 00:08:06.984
a little bit more money
thrown in their pocket.

00:08:06.984 --> 00:08:09.453
The government prints a bunch of money,

00:08:09.453 --> 00:08:12.649
drops it from helicopters,
and everyone has more money

00:08:12.649 --> 00:08:13.855
in their pockets.

00:08:13.855 --> 00:08:18.566
Well, then, all of a sudden,
at any given interest rate,

00:08:18.566 --> 00:08:23.588
the supply will go up.

00:08:23.588 --> 00:08:27.056
The supply curve will
shift in this direction,

00:08:27.056 --> 00:08:28.930
so we might have a new
supply curve that looks

00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:30.922
something like this.

00:08:30.922 --> 00:08:32.653
We might have a new
supply curve that looks

00:08:32.653 --> 00:08:35.554
something like this.

00:08:35.556 --> 00:08:38.723
Then, also, maybe the demand will go down.

00:08:38.723 --> 00:08:41.084
At any given interest
rate, at any given price,

00:08:41.084 --> 00:08:43.501
there will be less demand,
because those people

00:08:43.501 --> 00:08:45.056
who needed to borrow money, now they have

00:08:45.056 --> 00:08:46.588
to borrow less money.

00:08:46.588 --> 00:08:50.321
This will shift to the left.

00:08:50.321 --> 00:08:54.551
The new demand curve might look like that.

00:08:54.551 --> 00:08:55.135
What happened?

00:08:55.135 --> 00:08:58.301
What would be our new equilibrium price?

00:08:58.301 --> 00:09:00.254
It depends how much I
shift one or the other,

00:09:00.254 --> 00:09:02.218
but the way I drew it,
our equilibrium quantity

00:09:02.218 --> 00:09:03.719
doesn't change much, but it could change,

00:09:03.719 --> 00:09:06.219
depending on how much the
supply or demand shifts.

00:09:06.219 --> 00:09:08.221
What does definitely
happen, when that money

00:09:08.221 --> 00:09:11.186
got printed and distributed
to all of these people,

00:09:11.186 --> 00:09:14.469
is now all of a sudden, the
equilibrium interest rate

00:09:14.469 --> 00:09:15.718
has gone down.

00:09:15.718 --> 00:09:16.968
The equilibrium interest rate now,

00:09:16.968 --> 00:09:18.854
based on the way I drew
it, looks like it's closer

00:09:18.854 --> 00:09:22.252
to about, I don't know, about 6%.

00:09:22.252 --> 00:09:23.301
The whole -

00:09:23.301 --> 00:09:24.470
You can even think of
another reality where,

00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:26.635
all of a sudden, money
disappears from the market,

00:09:26.635 --> 00:09:28.551
or a reality where, for whatever reason,

00:09:28.551 --> 00:09:30.719
because of good marketing
or a psychological shift

00:09:30.719 --> 00:09:36.455
in people, all of a sudden,
people want to save less,

00:09:36.455 --> 00:09:38.654
so that there is less supply of money.

00:09:38.654 --> 00:09:39.988
Or maybe, all of a sudden, there's all

00:09:39.988 --> 00:09:41.802
these great investment opportunities,

00:09:41.802 --> 00:09:43.922
so now there's more demand for money

00:09:43.922 --> 00:09:45.219
and you could think about how these curves

00:09:45.219 --> 00:09:47.470
would shift and what would
happen to the interest rate.

00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:49.886
Just how you would think
about it for any good

00:09:49.886 --> 00:09:53.400
or service in a microeconomic context.
