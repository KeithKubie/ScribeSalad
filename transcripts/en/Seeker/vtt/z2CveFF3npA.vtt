00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.050
Babies are getting better and better with
technology.

00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:04.640
They still suck at driving though, so…

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:10.750
I’ve got them there.

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:15.509
Welcome to DNews, I’m Ross Everett and I’m
better than a baby.

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:21.500
Sure, baby’s are tiny balls of meat that
somehow have managed to make being bald adorable,

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.990
but the question everyone is asking, for the
sake of this news piece, is at what age should

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:28.020
they be allowed to use digital media?

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.490
There are videos on the internet of babies
using smart phones like it’s second nature,

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:33.030
swishing and swiping.

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.090
Tapping and turning, all as if it’s an extension
of themselves.

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.090
Which is terrifying.

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.610
They’re advancing quicker than we’ve ever
imagined.

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:43.780
Next thing you know, they’re going to get
older and take over our jobs just like humans

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:45.020
have been doing for generations!

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:50.090
But the question remains, at how young is
too young to use this type of technology?

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.220
The American Pediatric Association says that
screens should be avoided before the age of

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.610
two, but they also lump passively watching
TV into the same category as the interactive

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:01.969
and participatory use of smartphones and tablets
which seems absurd.

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:06.030
Well, it’s possible that children under
the age of two might not be able to distinguish

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.990
the difference between the two screens.

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.970
Minds that young can’t comprehend what we
call dual representation, which is the ability

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.159
to look at a photo of a car and know that
it is both a picture and a representation

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:17.159
of a car.

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.250
Child psychologists also point out that interactive
apps can interfere with a child’s story

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:22.420
comprehension.

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:28.670
Apps lack the necessary range and linguistic
cues of a human speaker, which are crucial

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.970
for early language development in kids as
they need to be able to try mimicking facial

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.830
expressions, gestures, tones of voice and
body language.

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:42.409
Which is why I sound so much like my mother
and father when I talk, and not like an app.

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:43.409
But, come on!

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.180
We’re not at a place where technology could
adopt natural sounding voices?

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:47.939
I call shenanigans.

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.790
Quality matters, though, and while children’s
print books go through a competitive peer

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:56.500
review process, sometimes with years of experts
weighing in with opinion, app store review

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.140
guidelines for children’s apps are way quicker
by comparison.

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.540
Not to mention the lack of variation an app
conveys the world to be compared to the actual

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:05.540
world.

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.119
And it’s reported that touch is the number
one means of communication and learning in

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.830
early childhood, so when we replace squeezing
and chewing, with swiping and tapping children

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.730
might be missing out on some very important
developmental tools.

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.550
Of course, it’s impossible and impractical
to keep babies away from the devices that

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.640
are everywhere in our lives, but this is merely
a report on the importance of continuing real

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.590
life contact and interactions with children
instead of letting a device raise and teach

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.090
the child so we can continue letting our devices
run our lives.

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.260
In fact, some of you might be watching this
on one right now…

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.570
What do you think, how much screen time is
too much screen time for children?

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:40.120
Let me know in the comments down below.

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.531
And if you’re curious about if Internet
addiction is a real thing, I was in a video

00:02:43.531 --> 00:02:57.400
over on The New Show that explains how it
could actually be worse than alcohol withdrawal.
