00:00:13.282 --> 00:00:15.484
Mysteries of vernacular:

00:00:15.484 --> 00:00:17.323
Gorgeous,

00:00:17.323 --> 00:00:19.967
beautiful or very attractive.

00:00:19.967 --> 00:00:21.524
The source of the word gorgeous

00:00:21.524 --> 00:00:24.426
can be found in the Latin word, gurges,

00:00:24.426 --> 00:00:26.219
used by the Romans to describe

00:00:26.219 --> 00:00:29.090
a whirling, swirling whirlpool.

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:31.904
Thanks to the aquatic phenomenon's cylindrical shape

00:00:31.904 --> 00:00:33.703
and gurgling form,

00:00:33.703 --> 00:00:37.730
gurges also came to mean throat.

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.711
By the time gurges reached England in the 14th century,

00:00:41.711 --> 00:00:44.623
it had been altered to gorge.

00:00:44.623 --> 00:00:47.740
This, to the English, seemed like an appropriate way

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:50.658
to describe a steep and rocky ravine,

00:00:50.658 --> 00:00:52.830
a metaphorical extension of the words

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:55.337
referenced to the throat.

00:00:55.337 --> 00:01:00.443
The French, however, transformed gorge into gorgias

00:01:00.443 --> 00:01:01.768
and used it to describe

00:01:01.768 --> 00:01:03.447
one of the most fashionable trends

00:01:03.447 --> 00:01:05.223
of the Middle Ages,

00:01:05.223 --> 00:01:07.552
also known as a wimple.

00:01:07.552 --> 00:01:09.512
This popular article of clothing

00:01:09.512 --> 00:01:12.241
revealed only the madame's visage,

00:01:12.241 --> 00:01:13.643
covering her shoulders,

00:01:13.643 --> 00:01:14.351
head,

00:01:14.351 --> 00:01:17.189
and, of course, her throat .

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.680
A stylish and intricate gorgias

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.149
was so telling of class and affluence

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:24.544
that the word soon came to mean

00:01:24.544 --> 00:01:27.889
fond of dress and elegant.

00:01:27.889 --> 00:01:29.949
This newly fashioned adjective

00:01:29.949 --> 00:01:34.273
voyaged into Middle English as gorgayse,

00:01:34.273 --> 00:01:38.167
where it was fully anglicized as gorgeous.

00:01:38.167 --> 00:01:40.553
Since then, it has been linked to all things

00:01:40.553 --> 00:01:44.213
of exceptionally graceful allure.
