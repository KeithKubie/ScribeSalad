00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:04.790
F of x equals x cubed is the simplest cubic function that I can think of. Since

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:08.758
in order to be a cubic polynomial, an expression must have at least one term

00:00:08.758 --> 00:00:12.658
that's of degree 3, and that must be the term with the highest degree. This

00:00:12.658 --> 00:00:16.154
certainly does seem like the simplest cubic function we can come up with. It's

00:00:16.154 --> 00:00:20.773
just x multiplied by itself three times. Now, because this function is so basic,

00:00:20.773 --> 00:00:25.530
so primary, this gets a special name, a special designation, of being called the

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:30.897
parent function for cubics. Just like f of x squared is the parent function for

00:00:30.897 --> 00:00:31.872
quadratics.
