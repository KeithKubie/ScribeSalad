sure it's something that they're going
to be interested in so understanding

00:19:01.450 --> 00:19:01.460
to be interested in so understanding
 

00:19:01.460 --> 00:19:02.830
to be interested in so understanding
what topics they've selected what

00:19:02.830 --> 00:19:02.840
what topics they've selected what
 

00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:04.900
what topics they've selected what
articles they tend to read is a really

00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:04.910
articles they tend to read is a really
 

00:19:04.910 --> 00:19:06.720
articles they tend to read is a really
powerful tool for being able to do that

00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:06.730
powerful tool for being able to do that
 

00:19:06.730 --> 00:19:09.130
powerful tool for being able to do that
now you can take this a step further and

00:19:09.130 --> 00:19:09.140
now you can take this a step further and
 

00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:11.350
now you can take this a step further and
aggregate all of the results server-side

00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:11.360
aggregate all of the results server-side
 

00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:13.450
aggregate all of the results server-side
and this may in fact be an even better

00:19:13.450 --> 00:19:13.460
and this may in fact be an even better
 

00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:15.340
and this may in fact be an even better
option in some cases then trying to make

00:19:15.340 --> 00:19:15.350
option in some cases then trying to make
 

00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:18.100
option in some cases then trying to make
it too customized to find out what is

that everyone is clicking everyone is
 

00:19:21.290 --> 00:19:23.380
that everyone is clicking everyone is
reading through and potentially what are

00:19:23.380 --> 00:19:23.390
reading through and potentially what are
 

00:19:23.390 --> 00:19:25.510
reading through and potentially what are
they all sharing and that is probably

00:19:25.510 --> 00:19:25.520
they all sharing and that is probably
 

00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:27.130
they all sharing and that is probably
something which everyone else is going

00:19:27.130 --> 00:19:27.140
something which everyone else is going
 

00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:28.480
something which everyone else is going
to be interested in so you can take

00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:28.490
to be interested in so you can take
 

00:19:28.490 --> 00:19:30.670
to be interested in so you can take
those aggregated server-side results and

00:19:30.670 --> 00:19:30.680
those aggregated server-side results and
 

00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:32.220
those aggregated server-side results and
use it to use cloud-to-device messaging

00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:32.230
use it to use cloud-to-device messaging
 

00:19:32.230 --> 00:19:34.780
use it to use cloud-to-device messaging
to ping everyone that this is an article

00:19:34.780 --> 00:19:34.790
to ping everyone that this is an article
 

00:19:34.790 --> 00:19:36.430
to ping everyone that this is an article
that they may want to read and pop up a

00:19:36.430 --> 00:19:36.440
that they may want to read and pop up a
 

00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:39.730
that they may want to read and pop up a
notification accordingly now you can

00:19:39.730 --> 00:19:39.740

article to help decide which articles to
 

00:19:44.210 --> 00:19:45.310
article to help decide which articles to
prefetch now we've talked about

00:19:45.310 --> 00:19:45.320
prefetch now we've talked about
 

00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:47.230

cost of getting those regular updates

00:19:54.970 --> 00:19:54.980
cost of getting those regular updates
 

00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:56.860
cost of getting those regular updates
it's really a way of you being able to

00:19:56.860 --> 00:19:56.870
it's really a way of you being able to
 

00:19:56.870 --> 00:19:58.870
it's really a way of you being able to
figure out what is the user going to

00:19:58.870 --> 00:19:58.880
figure out what is the user going to
 

00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:01.000
figure out what is the user going to
need in the next two to five minutes or

need in the next two to five minutes or
 

00:20:01.010 --> 00:20:03.100
need in the next two to five minutes or
get it all now so then as soon as they

00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:03.110
get it all now so then as soon as they
 

00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:04.570
get it all now so then as soon as they
click on something it's already there

00:20:04.570 --> 00:20:04.580
click on something it's already there
 

00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:06.460
click on something it's already there
they don't have to wait at all there's

00:20:06.460 --> 00:20:06.470
they don't have to wait at all there's
 

00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:07.840
they don't have to wait at all there's
also a significant battery cost

00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:07.850
also a significant battery cost
 

00:20:07.850 --> 00:20:09.730
also a significant battery cost
associated with turning on the cell

00:20:09.730 --> 00:20:09.740

radio in order to
 

00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:12.779
radio in order to
download things so you want to try and

00:20:12.779 --> 00:20:12.789
download things so you want to try and
 

00:20:12.789 --> 00:20:14.039
download things so you want to try and
bundle all of that together and

00:20:14.039 --> 00:20:14.049
bundle all of that together and
 

00:20:14.049 --> 00:20:15.659
bundle all of that together and
prefetching is a great way of being able

00:20:15.659 --> 00:20:15.669
prefetching is a great way of being able
 

00:20:15.669 --> 00:20:17.580
prefetching is a great way of being able
to take all of the articles which you

00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:17.590
to take all of the articles which you
 

00:20:17.590 --> 00:20:19.769
to take all of the articles which you
think they may read pre downloading them

00:20:19.769 --> 00:20:19.779
think they may read pre downloading them
 

00:20:19.779 --> 00:20:21.120
think they may read pre downloading them
so that you don't have to do it each

00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:21.130
so that you don't have to do it each
 

00:20:21.130 --> 00:20:23.549
so that you don't have to do it each
time they click one now if you know what

00:20:23.549 --> 00:20:23.559
time they click one now if you know what
 

00:20:23.559 --> 00:20:26.039
time they click one now if you know what
articles are topics you do user is as

00:20:26.039 --> 00:20:26.049
articles are topics you do user is as
 

00:20:26.049 --> 00:20:28.080
articles are topics you do user is as
likely to actually read including the

frequency at which they're likely to
 

00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:31.799
frequency at which they're likely to
read it you stand a great chance of

00:20:31.799 --> 00:20:31.809
read it you stand a great chance of
 

00:20:31.809 --> 00:20:33.240
read it you stand a great chance of
downloading the right data at the right

00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:33.250
downloading the right data at the right
 

00:20:33.250 --> 00:20:35.159
downloading the right data at the right
time and really have a dramatic impact

00:20:35.159 --> 00:20:35.169
time and really have a dramatic impact
 

00:20:35.169 --> 00:20:38.039

on battery life while also reducing that

00:20:38.039 --> 00:20:38.049
on battery life while also reducing that
 

00:20:38.049 --> 00:20:41.519
on battery life while also reducing that
latency to nearly zero so that lets you

00:20:41.519 --> 00:20:41.529
latency to nearly zero so that lets you
 

00:20:41.529 --> 00:20:43.740
latency to nearly zero so that lets you
aggressively prefetch and making sure

00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:43.750
aggressively prefetch and making sure
 

00:20:43.750 --> 00:20:45.480
aggressively prefetch and making sure
that you always have fresh articles to

00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:45.490
that you always have fresh articles to
 

00:20:45.490 --> 00:20:47.580
that you always have fresh articles to
read and reducing that latency when you

00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:47.590
read and reducing that latency when you
 

00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:49.409
read and reducing that latency when you
click a headline so it's a really great

00:20:49.409 --> 00:20:49.419
click a headline so it's a really great
 

00:20:49.419 --> 00:20:51.600
click a headline so it's a really great
approach and you can see here a code

00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:51.610
approach and you can see here a code
 

00:20:51.610 --> 00:20:53.490
approach and you can see here a code
snippet which lets you vary the amount

00:20:53.490 --> 00:20:53.500
snippet which lets you vary the amount
 

00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:55.529
snippet which lets you vary the amount
of data that you're downloading based on

00:20:55.529 --> 00:20:55.539
of data that you're downloading based on
 

00:20:55.539 --> 00:20:56.840
of data that you're downloading based on
the cell radio connection that you have

00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:56.850
the cell radio connection that you have
 

00:20:56.850 --> 00:21:00.090
the cell radio connection that you have
which really boils down to the faster

00:21:00.090 --> 00:21:00.100
which really boils down to the faster
 

00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:01.440
which really boils down to the faster
the radio the more data you should

00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:01.450
the radio the more data you should
 

00:21:01.450 --> 00:21:04.560
the radio the more data you should
download when you're prefetching so now

00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:04.570
download when you're prefetching so now
 

00:21:04.570 --> 00:21:05.850
download when you're prefetching so now
that you're using analytics and

00:21:05.850 --> 00:21:05.860
that you're using analytics and
 

00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:08.130
that you're using analytics and
prefetching you run the risk of draining

00:21:08.130 --> 00:21:08.140
prefetching you run the risk of draining
 

00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:10.380
prefetching you run the risk of draining
the battery due to to to frequent Radio

00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:10.390
the battery due to to to frequent Radio
 

00:21:10.390 --> 00:21:12.659
the battery due to to to frequent Radio
state transitions so to minimize this

00:21:12.659 --> 00:21:12.669
state transitions so to minimize this
 

00:21:12.669 --> 00:21:14.460
state transitions so to minimize this
you need to bundle all your transfers as

00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:14.470
you need to bundle all your transfers as
 

00:21:14.470 --> 00:21:16.830
you need to bundle all your transfers as
much as possible now analytics is a long

00:21:16.830 --> 00:21:16.840
much as possible now analytics is a long
 

00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:18.779
much as possible now analytics is a long
game you don't need to your algorithms

00:21:18.779 --> 00:21:18.789
game you don't need to your algorithms
 

00:21:18.789 --> 00:21:20.580

don't need to be working out you know

00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:20.590
don't need to be working out you know
 

00:21:20.590 --> 00:21:22.799
don't need to be working out you know
every click how does this change you

00:21:22.799 --> 00:21:22.809
every click how does this change you

really wants to be working on large

00:21:25.409 --> 00:21:25.419
really wants to be working on large
 

00:21:25.419 --> 00:21:27.720
really wants to be working on large
corpuses views of data so there's no

00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:27.730
corpuses views of data so there's no
 

00:21:27.730 --> 00:21:29.399
corpuses views of data so there's no
particular urgency to getting those

00:21:29.399 --> 00:21:29.409
particular urgency to getting those
 

00:21:29.409 --> 00:21:31.860
particular urgency to getting those
current usages those clicks back to the

00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:31.870
current usages those clicks back to the
 

00:21:31.870 --> 00:21:33.690
current usages those clicks back to the
server which means that you want to

00:21:33.690 --> 00:21:33.700
server which means that you want to
 

00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:35.159
server which means that you want to
batch them up and upload them at the

00:21:35.159 --> 00:21:35.169
batch them up and upload them at the
 

00:21:35.169 --> 00:21:36.630
batch them up and upload them at the
same time as you're going to do other

00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:36.640
same time as you're going to do other
 

00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:39.450
same time as you're going to do other
more time-sensitive transfers so using a

00:21:39.450 --> 00:21:39.460
more time-sensitive transfers so using a
 

00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:41.639
more time-sensitive transfers so using a
general pattern like this one you can

00:21:41.639 --> 00:21:41.649
general pattern like this one you can
 

00:21:41.649 --> 00:21:43.799
general pattern like this one you can
ensure that you're pre-empting every

00:21:43.799 --> 00:21:43.809
ensure that you're pre-empting every
 

00:21:43.809 --> 00:21:45.810
ensure that you're pre-empting every
next prefetch so if you're if user

00:21:45.810 --> 00:21:45.820
next prefetch so if you're if user
 

00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:47.100
next prefetch so if you're if user
clicks on a headline which you haven't

00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:47.110
clicks on a headline which you haven't
 

00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:48.810
clicks on a headline which you haven't
already downloaded you're going to need

00:21:48.810 --> 00:21:48.820
already downloaded you're going to need
 

00:21:48.820 --> 00:21:50.460
already downloaded you're going to need
to ping the server and grab that content

00:21:50.460 --> 00:21:50.470
to ping the server and grab that content
 

00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:52.260
to ping the server and grab that content
that's a great time to initiate the next

00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:52.270
that's a great time to initiate the next
 

00:21:52.270 --> 00:21:54.060
that's a great time to initiate the next
prefetch as well so the next bunch of

00:21:54.060 --> 00:21:54.070
prefetch as well so the next bunch of
 

00:21:54.070 --> 00:21:56.460
prefetch as well so the next bunch of
articles that the user may be reading as

00:21:56.460 --> 00:21:56.470
articles that the user may be reading as
 

00:21:56.470 --> 00:21:58.289
articles that the user may be reading as
well as then uploading all of your

00:21:58.289 --> 00:21:58.299
well as then uploading all of your
 

00:21:58.299 --> 00:22:00.930
