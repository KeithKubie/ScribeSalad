00:00:00.633 --> 00:00:03.266
[music playing]

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.300
KATIE COURIC: If the
battle over monuments

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:17.000
has been raging in towns
across the country,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.567
the early skirmishes started
at Ivy League universities

00:00:21.567 --> 00:00:22.667
like Yale.

00:00:22.667 --> 00:00:23.500
CROWD: Hey hey!

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:24.433
Ho ho!

00:00:24.433 --> 00:00:26.133
Calhoun's College has to go.

00:00:26.133 --> 00:00:26.967
Hey hey!

00:00:26.967 --> 00:00:28.934
Ho ho!

00:00:28.934 --> 00:00:32.066
Calhoun's College has to go.

00:00:32.066 --> 00:00:35.800
KATIE COURIC: Calhoun College
was named in 1933 after Yale

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.166
alumnus John C. Calhoun, a
senator from South Carolina who

00:00:40.166 --> 00:00:42.467
later served as vice
president to John Quincy

00:00:42.467 --> 00:00:44.100
Adams and Andrew Jackson.

00:00:46.633 --> 00:00:48.734
But that's not all.

00:00:48.734 --> 00:00:51.000
In the first half
of the 19th century,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.433
he was the most strident
articulator, to use his words,

00:00:57.433 --> 00:01:01.500
of slavery as a positive good.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.400
And he rooted that
view that slavery

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:10.233
was a positive both for
slave holders and slaves,

00:01:10.233 --> 00:01:11.700
an idea that--

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.467
that-- that I think is deeply
disturbing to us today.

00:01:14.467 --> 00:01:20.700
He rooted that belief in core
beliefs about white supremacy.

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.266
KATIE COURIC: Senior Dasia
Moore said Calhoun's name

00:01:24.266 --> 00:01:28.300
and the images from his
time made her uncomfortable,

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.033
especially in the dining hall.

00:01:30.033 --> 00:01:31.667
Right across
from me, I can see

00:01:31.667 --> 00:01:34.300
this stained glass
window that depicts

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.967
two slaves picking something.

00:01:37.967 --> 00:01:41.033
It's a symbol that declares,
you do not belong here,

00:01:41.033 --> 00:01:43.633
or you are imagined
in this space

00:01:43.633 --> 00:01:47.433
to fulfill a certain
really limited role.

00:01:47.433 --> 00:01:49.333
KATIE COURIC: The
already simmering debate

00:01:49.333 --> 00:01:51.734
became more heated
after Yale dining

00:01:51.734 --> 00:01:55.633
hall worker Corey Menafee
smashed one of the windows.

00:01:55.633 --> 00:01:58.166
REPORTER: Although a university
worker for eight years,

00:01:58.166 --> 00:02:00.667
Menafee says he had been
working in the dining hall

00:02:00.667 --> 00:02:03.000
at Calhoun College
for just six months.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.900
While mopping the floors, the
38-year-old took a mop handle

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.333
to the subject of his disgust.

00:02:10.333 --> 00:02:12.633
KATIE COURIC: What was going
through your head, Corey?

00:02:12.633 --> 00:02:13.700
I was--

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.800
I was just sick of
looking at that window.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.300
Here we are in the 21st
century, and I don't think

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.066
those type of images should
be blatantly displayed

00:02:22.066 --> 00:02:23.900
in places like dining halls.

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.400
It's culturally insensitive.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.333
It's no secret that the
majority of the employees

00:02:29.333 --> 00:02:32.967
who work in the dining hall are
of African-American descent.

00:02:32.967 --> 00:02:35.934
KATIE COURIC: It was a literal
and figurative breaking point.

00:02:35.934 --> 00:02:38.967
WOMAN (ON BULLHORN): Take down
these racist window panes.

00:02:38.967 --> 00:02:41.000
CROWD: Change the name.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.500
KATIE COURIC: Yale President
Peter Salovey was initially

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.166
opposed to changing the name.

00:02:46.166 --> 00:02:49.934
Our campus, both
in the classroom

00:02:49.934 --> 00:02:53.066
but also outside
of the classroom,

00:02:53.066 --> 00:02:55.400
it is a living history lesson.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:01.000
And I wanted to make sure that
that conversation about Calhoun

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.667
was one that we
could always have.

00:03:03.667 --> 00:03:05.800
MAN (ON BULLHORN): Calhoun
does not deserve [inaudible]..

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.667
CROWD: Change the name.

00:03:08.667 --> 00:03:11.467
KATIE COURIC: Salovey was caught
between students who thought

00:03:11.467 --> 00:03:13.967
his decision was
wrong-headed, and older

00:03:13.967 --> 00:03:18.567
alumni who felt he should
stand on the side of tradition.

00:03:18.567 --> 00:03:22.266
So Salovey appointed a committee
to come up with a blueprint

00:03:22.266 --> 00:03:24.467
for who stays and who goes.

00:03:24.467 --> 00:03:27.033
After all, nine other
buildings on campus

00:03:27.033 --> 00:03:29.567
are named for men
associated with slavery,

00:03:29.567 --> 00:03:32.333
including Elihu Yale himself.

00:03:32.333 --> 00:03:34.467
John Witt was head
of the committee.

00:03:34.467 --> 00:03:37.633
Renaming ought to be a rare
thing on a research university

00:03:37.633 --> 00:03:41.166
campus like ours, but sometimes
renaming might be appropriate.

00:03:41.166 --> 00:03:43.166
We're supposed to think
abstractly about principle

00:03:43.166 --> 00:03:45.400
legacies, thinking about
whether the idea is

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.834
contested at the
time of the namesake,

00:03:47.834 --> 00:03:49.600
thinking about what the
motive of the university

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.667
was in putting the
name on the building.

00:03:51.667 --> 00:03:53.367
And then last, how
does the building work

00:03:53.367 --> 00:03:56.633
in helping to build community.

00:03:56.633 --> 00:03:58.834
KATIE COURIC: The committee
came up with four principles

00:03:58.834 --> 00:04:02.300
and discovered Calhoun's
name was controversial even

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.900
back in 1933.

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:09.000
There were statements written
at the time saying, really?

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.500
John C. Calhoun?

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.400
KATIE COURIC: So at
a ceremony this fall,

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.133
Calhoun College was
officially renamed

00:04:15.133 --> 00:04:18.400
after the late Navy
Admiral, computer pioneer,

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.066
and Yale alumna, Grace Hopper.

00:04:21.066 --> 00:04:24.934
Bless those that belong
to this college now.

00:04:24.934 --> 00:04:29.200
Grace Marie Hopper is your home.

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.400
Was it emotional for
you, Dasia, in there?

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:32.033
It was.

00:04:32.033 --> 00:04:33.500
I mean, I--

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.266
I got hit with the emotion
right before I walked in,

00:04:35.266 --> 00:04:36.967
and it was just pure joy.

00:04:36.967 --> 00:04:40.467
Well, I was really excited
about it, because I've always

00:04:40.467 --> 00:04:42.333
looked up to Grace Hopper
ever since I learned

00:04:42.333 --> 00:04:43.767
about her in high school.

00:04:43.767 --> 00:04:47.233
So now when people ask
you what college you're in--

00:04:47.233 --> 00:04:49.533
I'm really excited to
tell them I'm in Hopper.

00:04:49.533 --> 00:04:52.333
I'm really proud to be
here as a sophomore.

00:04:52.333 --> 00:04:54.367
Changing the
people that we honor,

00:04:54.367 --> 00:04:57.100
um, helps a wider
range of students

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:59.734
be able to envision
themselves as someone

00:04:59.734 --> 00:05:02.367
who can make a difference,
who will be remembered.

00:05:02.367 --> 00:05:04.000
KATIE COURIC: As part
of a conscious effort

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.767
to not sanitize
or erase the past,

00:05:06.767 --> 00:05:10.600
Calhoun's name and image
will remain on the edifice.

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:14.500
It's no longer the name by
which this college is known,

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:20.133
but the history and what we need
to learn from and about John

00:05:20.133 --> 00:05:23.767
C. Calhoun is not wiped away.

00:05:23.767 --> 00:05:29.200
We can't forget that Yale was
a university that once did have

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.166
a college, a very important
part of the campus,

00:05:31.166 --> 00:05:34.633
dedicated to John C. Calhoun.
