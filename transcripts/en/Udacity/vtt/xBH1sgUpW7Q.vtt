00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Basically, I calculated the chain first and then I calculated all the other ones

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:16.000
where I couldn't count between the 0 in the first element because I'd already done that

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and so it's just one list and write down a whole lot mixed--that one was straight.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
So it was less than 2n for the combination ??? so it has to be Θ(n).

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Okay. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;And then n-1 links to get the chain. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;Yup.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:44.000
And then n-2 links to get all the rest. So that's a total of 2n-3 which is Θ(n). Right.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Right. Yeah. I guess that's kind of another way to think about it.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
I mean in this case I guess it's kind of simple but one thing I'd like to--

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.000
a more complicated guess is like what happens when you add one more edge.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Like you have your combination lock and you add another edge you can add

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
two more nodes to kind of each edge and add two nodes

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
and so it's going to continue to grow literally.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Then you think about what you have if you have one node.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Yeah. I guess kind of the jump from the first node to the second node is—

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Sorry from the first node to the second node is a little different

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
because you only had one edge but you know sort of

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
when you think of big theta and big O notation

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
you're dealing with bigger numbers like how it grows as it gets very large.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Because we're doing big theta you don't really have to think about

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
the base case of zero nodes or one node or two nodes.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Right. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;But if you think about in your case adding any node.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:51.000
I'm going to add two more edges. So that's ???. Okay. Yes. Just. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;Yup.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Just part of the definition is like you know for all n greater than n₀, okay,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:09.000
like you have fn is less than--like C₁gn or C₂gn and it's this part right here it's like--

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
as it gets bigger you can--you don't have to worry about those cases.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
You don't have to worry about all the numbers that are less than some

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
and some maybe not but--

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000
I mean for this one it's simple. It's kind of--it's pretty easy to think about.
