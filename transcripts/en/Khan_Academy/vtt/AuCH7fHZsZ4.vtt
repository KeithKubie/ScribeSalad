00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:03.640
The word arbitrage
sounds very fancy,

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:05.690
but it's actually
a very simple idea.

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:08.039
It's really just
taking advantage

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:11.680
of differences in price on
essentially the same thing

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:13.095
to make risk-free profit.

00:00:13.095 --> 00:00:14.720
So let's just think
about a little bit.

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:19.330
Let's say in one part of town
there's some type of a market.

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:21.910
Let's say it's a
market for apples.

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:24.380
And let's say in
that market, apples

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.500
sell for-- just
make up some price.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.140
Let's say that apple's in
that market, sell for $1

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.710
an apple, $1 per apple.

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.410
And let's say in another part of
town, you have another market.

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:41.880
Another market's
literally a fruit market.

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:53.770
And in that other part of town,
apples sell for $1.50 an apple.

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:56.100
And we're going to assume
that these apples are

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.080
completely identical apples.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.080
How could you take advantage
in this price difference

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:05.080
on these identical things
to make a risk-free profit?

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.800
Well ideally, you would want
to sell apples in the more

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.980
expensive market where you
could get $1.50 per apple.

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:13.810
And you would want to buy apples
in the less expensive market

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.020
where you can get
them for $1 per apple.

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.500
And that's exactly
what you would do.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.500
You would go do this market
over here, you would buy apples.

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:28.470
Let's say you buy
10 apples for $10.

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.260
And then you would go
maybe ride your bicycle

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.110
a couple of blocks to that
other market over there.

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.750
And you would sell
your 10 apples.

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.690
So this is buy 10
apples for $10.

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:46.264
And then you would sell
those 10 apples for $15.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.675
And so you would make an
immediate risk-free profit

00:01:52.675 --> 00:01:53.920
of $5.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.750
You're buying for
10, selling at 5.

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.570
And you could just keep doing
that over and over again.

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:02.240
And on every trip as many apples
as your bicycle could carry

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.430
you'll just continue
to make money.

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.940
And so this is
what arbitrage is.

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:08.690
And just imagine a side effect.

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.440
If someone did this
enough, then what would do

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.170
is it would increase the
supply of apples here.

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.690
So supply would
increase in this market.

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.190
And on this market,
the demand would

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.230
increase because
there's someone who

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.580
just keeps buying
from this market

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.330
and selling into that market.

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.980
So what's eventually going to
happen when demand increases,

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.300
the price will go
up in this market.

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.900
And when the supply
increases in this market,

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.170
the price will go down.

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.200
So in theory, the
more you do this,

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.400
the more that you're going
to make these prices come

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.551
closer to each other.

00:02:42.551 --> 00:02:45.050
And eventually, you won't be
able to make any profit at all.

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:47.190
But while there's
this discrepancy,

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.397
you have an opportunity
for arbitrage.
