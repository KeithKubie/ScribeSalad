CASSIE SILVA: Hey
guys, how's it going?

00:00:05.258 --> 00:00:07.710
We are the cast
of "Rock of Ages."

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.830
So happy to be here
today at Google.

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:13.430
We are over at the Helen Hayes
Theater over at 44th Street.

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:15.664
And we're going to do
a couple more songs

00:00:15.664 --> 00:00:16.830
from our show for you today.

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:17.645
Thanks for having us.

00:01:41.427 --> 00:01:43.010
TONY LEPAGE: It's
totally in good fun,

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:44.520
everybody just has a
really, really great time,

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.750
everybody's just having
a ball, having a blast,

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.820
but every once in awhile-- I
was on for one of the main parts

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:55.650
one night and sometimes--
What I thought, at the time,

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:01.610
was a t-shirt due to its size
that was thrown at me ended up

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:03.920
being the biggest pair of
panties that I've ever seen

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:04.720
in my entire life--

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.020
MALE SPEAKER: A circus
tent of panties.

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.970
TONY LEPAGE: I didn't
know what was happening--

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:09.039
CRISTY CANDLER: Still warm.

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:09.720
TONY LEPAGE: Yes.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:10.220
Not great.

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.260
So I pick it up and what I
was thinking, honestly what

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.270
I was thinking at
the time was, I

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:18.894
was just like somebody
threw a T-shirt,

00:02:18.894 --> 00:02:21.080
I wonder if it says like,
I love "Rock of Ages."

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.294
What?

00:02:23.294 --> 00:02:25.210
And then everybody was
in on it kind of thing.

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:27.300
So we get some funny
stuff happening.

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:28.570
MICHAEL MINARIK: I had
a gentleman, real quick,

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:30.080
actually when I was on
for one of the characters.

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.900
You're dancing at the end of
the show and some guy next to me

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.610
is in a suit much like this one.

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.764
And it's not the costume
that we have on our show

00:02:36.764 --> 00:02:37.680
and I was like, hello.

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:38.860
He goes, how are you doing?

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.285
And I see an open
seat down there

00:02:40.285 --> 00:02:42.410
and I'm realizing that's
an audience member dancing

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:43.780
with me on my show.

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.547
So there are stairs
and I'm just dancing,

00:02:45.547 --> 00:02:47.880
pushing him toward the stairs
like, you're doing awesome

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.450
and then he goes back down
the stairs and into his seat.

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.270
So again, people are just
having honestly the time

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:54.770
of their lives
and they realize--

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:57.090
don't forget that
that's verboten to come

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:58.170
on stage with us.

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.190
But it's kind of the most--
I was in the show call "Les

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:04.320
Miserables" and while that
was fun, this is awesome.

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.560
So it's just kind
of the best time

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.112
every night to do
this show, I think.

00:03:08.112 --> 00:03:10.320
ALAN SEALES: Aaron, you're
making your Broadway debut

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.870
on the show so congratulations.

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.710
Do you feel that your personal
story kind of reflects

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:20.700
your character's story of coming
out of this small little town

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.176
and moving to the big city?

00:03:23.176 --> 00:03:25.550
AARON C. FINLEY: I'm from a
lot smaller town than Detroit

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:27.704
which is where my
character is from.

00:03:27.704 --> 00:03:30.370
I don't think Detroit's all that
small though everybody did move

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.860
away, right, when
everything kind of crashed.

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:34.450
I'm from Bozeman,
Montana which is

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:38.316
a really small town,
like 40,000, not tiny.

00:03:38.316 --> 00:03:39.440
But yeah, I think in a way.

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.390
I mean, Drew is a
young guy who wants

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:44.960
to pursue his dream
of being a rock star.

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:48.430
He moves to LA and he gets
a job in this awesome rock

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:50.510
bar that's famous.

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:54.260
He's just kind of dreaming
of being up on that stage.

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.620
I always wanted to sing but
I didn't know about theater

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:01.650
until I was 24 and in college.

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.909
For me, theater came along
late and when I found it

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:06.200
I just fell in love right away.

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.408
ALAN SEALES: You look like
you're like 24 and a half.

00:04:08.408 --> 00:04:11.340
AARON C. FINLEY: Yes
we'll keep it that way.

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:16.810
I have two children so I'm
definitely older than 24.

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:20.110
I didn't start that early.

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:23.017
But my journey is very
similar in that once I

00:04:23.017 --> 00:04:25.600
got into theater, I knew that I
wanted to do it at the highest

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.950
level and you have to come
to New York to do that.

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:30.880
Because Broadway is what we
look to in the theater world

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.050
anyways.

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:34.160
And so I moved out
from Seattle where

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:35.860
I'd been doing
theater professionally

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:38.500
and came out here with just
kind of a hope and a prayer,

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:42.450
and my wife and two little
ones, and four months later

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:45.470
just after auditioning and
showing up every morning

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:48.700
and hitting the pavement
as we say in the business,

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:51.130
I landed "Rock of Ages"
as a lead on Broadway.

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:53.340
And that was kind of
like wow, it can happen.

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:54.970
So yeah, it's been great.

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:56.130
It's been a crazy journey.

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:57.330
ALAN SEALES: You have
super fans, right,

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.650
you've got to have people
that come to the show over

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:02.740
and over and over again like
the equivalent of rock groupies

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:04.500
that come to the show.

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:10.230
GENSON BLIMLIN: We have a very
loyal fan base who absolutely

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:14.320
love this show and it's a
pretty remarkable thing.

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:18.150
To the point where most of
them are friends on Facebook

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:21.080
and they follow you on Twitter
and they want to chat it up

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.955
and it's great.

00:05:23.955 --> 00:05:27.270
The other shows that I've
done, that has never happened.

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:31.120
And it's really interesting.

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:36.070
There's this one guy.

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:37.680
His name is Rob.

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:38.460
Nice guy.

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:40.864
And I know every night
I know he's there

00:05:40.864 --> 00:05:42.780
because there's this one
section in the show--

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:44.320
MALE SPEAKER: Remember, this is
going up on YouTube so be nice.

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:44.980
GENSON BLIMLIN: I will.

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:45.480
Of course.

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:48.190
There's nothing
negative about it.

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:50.950
He, without a fail, will be
the one guy in the theater

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:52.440
to respond to this one joke.

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:54.930
I always know if he's there
because it gives me something

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:55.800
to play off of.

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.671
And because he
speaks right to me

00:05:57.671 --> 00:05:59.920
and I talk right back to him
which the audience thinks

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:02.410
is this amazing spontaneous
moment that happens.

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:06.660
Meanwhile, that guy's
been here 400 times.

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:10.324
It makes me look
really, really good.

00:06:10.324 --> 00:06:11.740
One day after the
show he's like I

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:14.820
hope you don't mind if I
do-- I was like, no man.

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:17.550
In a way he's part of
the show in that sense.

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:23.200
And I think that there's a
really cool thing about that.

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:25.460
They're, in a way,
personal with us.

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:27.354
You know, it's cool.

00:06:27.354 --> 00:06:28.770
TONY LEPAGE: It's
also amazing how

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:32.640
they'll come to new cast
members' opening nights.

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:35.720
Any time there's a new
cast member, they show up,

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:38.290
and any time somebody's leaving
the show, they'll show up

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:42.170
and they'll be at the stage
door to wish them off.

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:43.649
It's a great group of people.

00:06:43.649 --> 00:06:45.940
GENSON BLIMLIN: There's one
girl that's spent, I think,

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:48.692
what are her last three or
four birthdays-- every birthday

00:06:48.692 --> 00:06:49.400
she's been there.

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:52.680
And she's seen the show, I'm
not kidding you, 112 times.

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:53.950
Literally she puts it on.

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:55.900
Tonight was my 112th
time at "Rock of Ages."

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:58.410
It was my birthday and
Stacee talked to me

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:01.920
and he threw the panties at
me and it's a whole thing

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:02.790
but she loves it.

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:05.196
ANDREW CALL: That's three
straight months of shows.

00:07:05.196 --> 00:07:07.070
If you count that all
the way through, that's

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:10.020
three straight months of
8-a-week shows to come

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:11.740
see a show for five years.

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:13.060
It's impressive.

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:15.040
MICHAEL MINARIK:
We also had a lady

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:16.960
who at the very
beginning, Stacee Jaxx,

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:18.150
a character in the show--
if you haven't seen it--

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:20.540
is the big rock star of
the show and he came out

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:24.370
and this lady asked him
to sign her shoulder.

00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:25.220
And he's like, OK.

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:26.303
So he signed her shoulder.

00:07:26.303 --> 00:07:29.620
She came back the next day, that
was tattooed in her shoulder

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:32.110
because she loved the
show so much that she

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:33.530
got the tattoo in the shoulder.

00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:35.238
GENSON BLIMLIN: Not
the name Stacee Jaxx,

00:07:35.238 --> 00:07:37.860
but the guy who plays Stacee
Jaxx who isn't even in the show

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:38.360
anymore.

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:39.510
MICHAEL MINARIK: It's
now in her shoulder.

00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:40.640
We started to get tattoos.

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:44.460
We actually have a softball
team and we're not that bad.

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:47.790
We have fans-- two
time champions.

00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:50.670
But when you tell your dad you
beat Mary Poppins sometimes

00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:52.280
he's not as happy about it.

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:53.740
I'm like, we killed
Mary Poppins.

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:56.700
He's like, what are
you calling me for?

00:07:56.700 --> 00:08:00.050
But we have fans that come
to every softball game

00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:03.100
and will bake cookies
and stuff for us.

00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:04.600
ALAN SEALES: Literal
softball games?

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:04.960
MICHAEL MINARIK: Actually, yeah.

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:06.480
We play the other
Broadway shows,

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:08.550
so it's kind of interesting.

00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:10.040
Matthew Broderick
plays sometimes

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:11.900
and it's really an
interesting thing.

00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:13.650
Like the Newsies are
there flipping around

00:08:13.650 --> 00:08:15.450
in the outfield and stuff.

00:08:15.450 --> 00:08:16.390
It's pretty amazing.

00:08:18.804 --> 00:08:20.970
ALAN SEALES: You have to
play the game in character.

00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:22.594
MICHAEL MINARIK: That
would be awesome.

00:08:22.594 --> 00:08:23.206
But our fans--

00:08:23.206 --> 00:08:24.290
ANDREW CALL: --in costume.

00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:26.747
MICHAEL MINARIK: And we used
to have people do choreography

00:08:26.747 --> 00:08:27.980
for us in the front row.

00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:30.192
So sometimes again, as
different characters,

00:08:30.192 --> 00:08:32.650
you might mess up a little bit
and they'd be doing it right

00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:34.566
and so you'd watch them
in the front row doing

00:08:34.566 --> 00:08:36.750
your choreography because
they adore the show.

00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:40.047
Because of what Tony said, the
joy is just insanely infectious

00:08:40.047 --> 00:08:41.130
when you come to the show.
