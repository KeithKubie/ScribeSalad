1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:05,310
The Joe Rogan experience or bowling
or not make a commitment. Highlight,

2
00:00:05,311 --> 00:00:08,910
I think is one of the most
corrupt games. Oh yeah. Someone,

3
00:00:08,911 --> 00:00:11,190
someone tried to tell me
explain, oh, it was Joey.

4
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:14,430
He was explaining to
me how highlight works,

5
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:18,120
that it's all about gambling and the only
reason why it works is that people are

6
00:00:18,121 --> 00:00:21,180
betting on the games and so because
people are betting on the games,

7
00:00:21,181 --> 00:00:24,630
they get these guys and these guys are
just fucking miss it on purpose and they

8
00:00:24,631 --> 00:00:27,630
knew. Yeah. It's like it's
rigged. I might be wrong.

9
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:31,590
If you're a highlight play and you're
like, [inaudible] Joe Rogan, I love this,

10
00:00:31,591 --> 00:00:32,820
this podcast again.
Hey,

11
00:00:32,821 --> 00:00:35,460
I get my information from the Church
of what's happening here we go,

12
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,400
look at that damn glove. It's,
look how they play with that.

13
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:42,510
It looks like somebody with a one long
freaking nail. They're holding it right.

14
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:44,010
It's not like wrapped around their wrist.

15
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:47,130
They're holding it like a tennis racket.

16
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:51,480
How much more fun would it be if he
watched a baseball game with the picture?

17
00:00:51,481 --> 00:00:54,760
Just had that thing. Boy, that looks
so stupid. Just came look so dumb.

18
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,850
What's the goal? That goal? I don't know.

19
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:04,650
They're throwing it off the wall and then
another guy catches it and it throw it

20
00:01:04,651 --> 00:01:06,960
in, but they, somebody here to
get hit in the face pretty quick.

21
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:11,100
They're putting forth minimum effort. Even
when he falls down, it's like that guy,

22
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,690
he's fallen down like he's trying to
get a foul like, oh yeah, he does.

23
00:01:15,691 --> 00:01:19,340
He looks like he flopped. Yay.
Flow soccer. The soccer flops. Oh,

24
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:23,280
he soccer flopped it. That's why suck.
I'll never make it in America. The flop.

25
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:27,660
He can't get. Yeah, you have 30
years of flopping. You can check us.

26
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:30,240
We can watch it on TV. We know
what you do. You know though,

27
00:01:30,241 --> 00:01:32,930
I think it's catching on to
the NFL and the NBA floppy.

28
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:35,700
They're starting to flop a little bit
more because they see what happened.

29
00:01:35,701 --> 00:01:39,900
Didn't somebody analyze who's free?
Throw to the analyze.

30
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:42,870
What do you mean?
There was someone that analyzed,

31
00:01:42,871 --> 00:01:46,320
there was an ESPN analyst who analyzed,
um,

32
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:49,710
what's the guy's name of the big crazy
beard. Really good basketball player.

33
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:55,190
Oh fuck the clippers. Oh, go to, I
don't know what I'm pretended to know.

34
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:58,440
I literally don't know shit.
Go To uh,

35
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:02,970
Andrew Saul Schultz's things.
Kevin Duran, is that it?

36
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:06,150
Andrew Salt Schultz is go to Andrew.

37
00:02:06,151 --> 00:02:08,970
Saul Schultz is a Twitter page,

38
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:13,740
so he had it up on his
Twitter and I watched it and
I've watched it analysis the

39
00:02:13,741 --> 00:02:17,520
difference between him
when he's challenged and he
throws a free throw versus

40
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:21,990
unchallenged when he's on target
with the beard. James Harden. Okay.

41
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:22,980
We've been challenged,

42
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,100
meaning someone's trying to block him or
he has a free Oakland Shaka open shot.

43
00:02:27,101 --> 00:02:28,320
When he has a free open shot,

44
00:02:28,321 --> 00:02:31,410
he just jumps up in the air and
does his three is three pointer.

45
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:33,060
But when he's challenged,

46
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,380
he throws his legs up to hit the other
person so he could fall down on his ass.

47
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:41,430
And I'm like a leg kick, like a
dance move. Well he's not even,

48
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:44,040
it's not even a self defense move.
He's like making,

49
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:47,550
he's forcing contact with the
person so that you can fall down.

50
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:51,010
But it looks like, yeah, it's interesting.
So it looks like it got filed.

51
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:55,530
So here you'll see him, this
guy watch, watch, no one's
there, watch, watch, he jumps,

52
00:02:55,531 --> 00:02:57,840
he jumped straight up in the air,
straight up, just straight up in the air.

53
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:02,560
And this guy,
several shots where he does this and then,

54
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:06,790
um, then they show when he's
contested and when he's contested,

55
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:08,800
he jumps up in the air and look,

56
00:03:08,801 --> 00:03:11,920
he throws his body weight
forward and then it falls down.

57
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:14,330
So in the hopes that there'll be a foul,
yeah,

58
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,350
they're saying like if you
look at the way his body moves,

59
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:18,700
when someone's contesting him,

60
00:03:18,701 --> 00:03:23,110
he moves in Leni his legs
towards them to make contact.

61
00:03:23,111 --> 00:03:26,250
Do you think that's involuntary
or voluntary? Involuntary.

62
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:30,880
You see the problem is that pencil,
neck, Dork, fucking pushing that.

63
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,860
Now he's specifically known,

64
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:37,210
especially like in the last two or three
years for getting himself to the free

65
00:03:37,211 --> 00:03:41,110
throw line. Right. At a way higher
clip than almost anybody in history.

66
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:42,820
So like that's what they're also saying.

67
00:03:42,821 --> 00:03:46,300
Like you can't fault him for that because
he's using the rules of the game. Sure.

68
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:48,390
To play the game. Right.
So this guy is exempt.

69
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,670
Who is this guy who was examining this?
Do you know how I pelt?

70
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:52,720
He's got pell center guy,

71
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:57,770
so the head sports center guy is analyzing
this and he's realizing that the legs

72
00:03:57,881 --> 00:04:01,750
are moving in a direction towards the
other player because the guys there,

73
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:04,630
which is might exactly be what he's doing.

74
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,830
It might be that or it might be that he
has a devil reaction when someone's in

75
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:11,320
front of him and he almost wants to
kick the guy away from him. Yeah.

76
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:14,410
I don't know.
Most Times fouled a three point attempt.

77
00:04:14,411 --> 00:04:18,580
He has 95 60 more than
anybody in right now. So yeah,

78
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:22,060
I'm going to base on the son Scott Van
Pelt does that yet they've made it a rule

79
00:04:22,061 --> 00:04:23,380
to cause you may be correct.

80
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:26,230
There's a big thing that happened over
the weekend and their game cause you have

81
00:04:26,231 --> 00:04:29,110
to give the guy a space to land because
there are a couple of years ago there

82
00:04:29,111 --> 00:04:32,770
were a couple of defensive players
that got in trouble for hurting people.

83
00:04:32,771 --> 00:04:35,110
They're getting their ankles turned,
ruining their career,

84
00:04:35,111 --> 00:04:37,240
which has been ruining this team's
chances to win a championship.

85
00:04:37,241 --> 00:04:40,050
Lots of money involved. Yeah.
They made a, it's a flagrant foul,

86
00:04:40,051 --> 00:04:41,650
like it's very bad to do that.

87
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:45,640
And the referees all of a sudden
didn't didn't call this on Sunday,

88
00:04:45,641 --> 00:04:47,650
like the very first time all
year they stopped calling it.

89
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:49,630
That's why they're
talking about it really?

90
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,540
And they stopped calling it because
people were taking advantage of it.

91
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:55,930
Why they stopped calling it is the big
question that people were literally

92
00:04:55,931 --> 00:04:58,480
talking about for 48 hours.
Like why are they doing this?

93
00:04:58,481 --> 00:05:01,900
Bringing up the question of like, are the
officials really involved in the game?

94
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:05,920
And it's become a big just discussion
about another reason why I won't watch it.
