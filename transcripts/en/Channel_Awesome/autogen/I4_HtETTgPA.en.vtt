00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:55.640
clearly just for the creep factor and it
 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.820
clearly just for the creep factor and it
works and they get some nice scary

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:57.830
works and they get some nice scary

they had great build up but no scary
payoff as much at least scary imagery I

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.430

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:13.000
payoff as much at least scary imagery I
should say and this has some scary

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.010
should say and this has some scary
 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:15.280
should say and this has some scary
imagery which I very much enjoy that

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:15.290
imagery which I very much enjoy that
 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:17.020

creepy creepy creation so I really like
 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.130
creepy creepy creation so I really like
that um but here's the thing about the

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:24.140
that um but here's the thing about the
 

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:27.340
that um but here's the thing about the
film is that it's done in kind of an

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:27.350
film is that it's done in kind of an
 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:30.790
film is that it's done in kind of an
abstract way like I said it doesn't pick

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:30.800
abstract way like I said it doesn't pick
 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.010
abstract way like I said it doesn't pick
a time period it's keeping it very open

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:33.020
a time period it's keeping it very open
 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:36.700
a time period it's keeping it very open
and which I'm fine with

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:36.710
and which I'm fine with
 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:39.490
and which I'm fine with
I was curious where this was going I was

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:39.500
I was curious where this was going I was
 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.550
I was curious where this was going I was
actually trying to sort of guess uh

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560
actually trying to sort of guess uh
 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.320
actually trying to sort of guess uh
guess the twist or the surprise or

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:44.330
guess the twist or the surprise or
 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:47.860
guess the twist or the surprise or
whatever the setup was and they have

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:47.870
whatever the setup was and they have
 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.020
whatever the setup was and they have
this emphasis on certain numbers as well

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.030
this emphasis on certain numbers as well
 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:53.800
this emphasis on certain numbers as well
like the and maybe it's coincidence but

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:53.810
like the and maybe it's coincidence but
 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:54.820
like the and maybe it's coincidence but
some of these were a little too specific

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:54.830
some of these were a little too specific
 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:57.310
some of these were a little too specific
like the house that they start off on is

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:57.320
like the house that they start off on is
 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:00.910
like the house that they start off on is
numbered 1492 okay it could be a

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:00.920
numbered 1492 okay it could be a
 

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:02.830
numbered 1492 okay it could be a
coincidence whatever but then what goes

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:02.840
coincidence whatever but then what goes
 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:03.850
coincidence whatever but then what goes
to another house where the main

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:03.860
to another house where the main
 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:06.280
to another house where the main
character lives uh the three middle

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:06.290
character lives uh the three middle
 

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:07.870
character lives uh the three middle
numbers are there the other two numbers

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:07.880
numbers are there the other two numbers
 

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:10.030
numbers are there the other two numbers
are taken off why would they do that

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:10.040
are taken off why would they do that
 

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:14.080
are taken off why would they do that
that's so specific um and there's all

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:14.090
that's so specific um and there's all
 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:16.390
that's so specific um and there's all
sorts of weird little symbols like that

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:16.400
sorts of weird little symbols like that
 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.250
sorts of weird little symbols like that
throughout the film that make me think

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:18.260
throughout the film that make me think
 

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:19.780
throughout the film that make me think
okay well this is building up to

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:19.790
okay well this is building up to
 

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:22.680
okay well this is building up to
something and then the film obviously

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:22.690
something and then the film obviously
 

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:26.140
something and then the film obviously
purposefully ends abruptly it does not

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:26.150
purposefully ends abruptly it does not
 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:29.410
purposefully ends abruptly it does not
end unlike a big climax or I hope that

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:29.420
end unlike a big climax or I hope that
 

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:31.660
end unlike a big climax or I hope that
wasn't supposed to be the big climax in

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:31.670
wasn't supposed to be the big climax in
 

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:34.750
wasn't supposed to be the big climax in
the in this film uh and then you sir

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:34.760
the in this film uh and then you sir
 

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:37.570
the in this film uh and then you sir
realize all was supposed to be open to

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:37.580
realize all was supposed to be open to
 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:42.370
realize all was supposed to be open to
interpretation um here's my problem with

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:42.380
interpretation um here's my problem with
 

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:45.310
interpretation um here's my problem with
that anyone who knows me knows I love I

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:45.320
that anyone who knows me knows I love I
 

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:48.040
that anyone who knows me knows I love I

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:49.580
trying something different and in many
 

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:52.360
trying something different and in many
respects this one does uh you know I

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:52.370

problem with it though in my opinion uh
 

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:07.450
problem with it though in my opinion uh
this film gave too many rules for it to

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:07.460
this film gave too many rules for it to
 

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:10.900
this film gave too many rules for it to
live in an abstract world uh films that

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:10.910
live in an abstract world uh films that
 

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:14.050
live in an abstract world uh films that
really know how to do this know how much

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:14.060
really know how to do this know how much
 

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:16.600
really know how to do this know how much
reality to give and how much of an

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:16.610
reality to give and how much of an
 

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:19.660
reality to give and how much of an
abstract illusion to give or just a

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:19.670
abstract illusion to give or just a
 

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:23.020
abstract illusion to give or just a
world based on feelings and ideas you

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:23.030

there's far too much explanation of the
 

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:02.680

about you know this thing when I pass it

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:09.740
about you know this thing when I pass it
 

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:10.420

on to you
 

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:12.850
on to you
uh it's only in you and you have to pass

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:12.860
uh it's only in you and you have to pass
 

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:14.470
uh it's only in you and you have to pass
on to someone else but then that person

00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:14.480
on to someone else but then that person
 

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:15.430

biggest problem before I get to what
this thing is is that I felt that the

00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:11.130
this thing is is that I felt that the
 

00:14:11.130 --> 00:14:13.040

involving enough um in that it did not

00:14:20.570 --> 00:14:20.580

create enough of an abstract world or an
 

00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:25.820
create enough of an abstract world or an
idea behind it that I could pick up on
