responded and the answer to what those

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:07.820
responded and the answer to what those
 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:11.140
responded and the answer to what those
areas are is that they're actually both

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150
areas are is that they're actually both
 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.050

in the story of Orpheus and Eurydice
 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.760
in the story of Orpheus and Eurydice
it's the moment when Orpheus looks back

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:18.770
it's the moment when Orpheus looks back
 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:20.320

underworld and by making that mistake he
will never see her again and so it's the

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:25.520
will never see her again and so it's the
 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:28.560
will never see her again and so it's the
moment of greatest sadness in the piece

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:28.570
moment of greatest sadness in the piece
 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:33.340
moment of greatest sadness in the piece
but I strongly suspect that you graded

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.350
but I strongly suspect that you graded
 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:36.400
but I strongly suspect that you graded
the first one as being quite sad but you

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410
the first one as being quite sad but you
 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:38.830
the first one as being quite sad but you
graded the second one as being happier

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840
graded the second one as being happier
 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.930

the same part of the story and the
 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.460
the same part of the story and the
reason for that is that the first one is

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470
reason for that is that the first one is
 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:47.890

one was written before that idea of
 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:00.400
one was written before that idea of
minor is sad and major is happy was
