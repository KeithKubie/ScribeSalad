00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:03.850
To add our y-axis the method and

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:08.119
function signature are identical to what we did with our x-axis.

00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:13.240
Here we are adding a y-axis that corresponds to the attendance field of

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:14.480
our data.

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.970
Much of the magic with the chart happens with the ed series method.

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.850
If you notice, as I type the method call under myChart object for

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:26.310
the addSeries method, Chrome actually tries to help me out and

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.570
autocomplete the method I might be trying to call.

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:31.420
We can actually scroll this here, and

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:35.940
see every method that starts with add defined in the myChart object.

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.980
This can be very helpful if you're interactively trying to explore a library or

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.210
object that you're not familiar with without having to go

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:44.580
to external documentation.
