00:00:06.847 --> 00:00:13.330
In a Moment of Vision...

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:15.139
It's 1762.

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:18.231
John Montagu is the 4th Earl of Sandwich,

00:00:18.231 --> 00:00:22.612
a small parish in 
the southwest of England.

00:00:22.612 --> 00:00:24.959
Despite his keen administrative skills,

00:00:24.959 --> 00:00:27.098
Montagu is a corrupt politician,

00:00:27.098 --> 00:00:28.740
an adulterous husband,

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:35.550
and an incessant, degenerate gambler.

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.539
Often, while Montagu is in the midst
of a particularly high-stakes game,

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:44.521
he will insist on being served
his meals at the table.

00:00:44.521 --> 00:00:47.801
In a moment of vision,
though likely inspired by his travels,

00:00:47.801 --> 00:00:50.860
the Earl orders his meat and cheese
be brought to him

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.537
stacked between two slices of bread

00:00:53.537 --> 00:01:00.271
so that he may eat with one hand
while continuing to gamble with the other.

00:01:00.271 --> 00:01:06.551
In one notorious episode, Montagu
spends a full day and night gambling.

00:01:06.551 --> 00:01:09.540
It is during the infamous 24 hours
at the gaming table

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:17.039
that Montagu's characteristic handheld
concession is dubbed "the sandwich."

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:18.441
According to one estimate,

00:01:18.441 --> 00:01:24.692
Americans now consume more than
300 million sandwiches every day.
