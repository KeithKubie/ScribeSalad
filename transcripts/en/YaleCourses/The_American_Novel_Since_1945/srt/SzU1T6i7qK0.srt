1
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:03,260
Okay. I'll go ahead and
start. Just cause I'm,

2
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:06,910
I'm not sure how many people
will end up being here. So, um,

3
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:09,360
as promised today,

4
00:00:09,361 --> 00:00:13,530
I will tell you a little bit about the
exam and I'll show you some questions

5
00:00:13,531 --> 00:00:16,950
from a past year so that you
can see what they're like.

6
00:00:16,951 --> 00:00:19,830
We rewrite the exam every year.
Um,

7
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:23,390
even makeup exams are
all different. So, um,

8
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:26,670
I have a lot of these in my files.
Um,

9
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:31,410
the exam is two and a half
hours in a three hour, um,

10
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:35,940
in a three hour slot. We have two
rooms because we have a big class.

11
00:00:35,941 --> 00:00:40,620
They've given us this room and one o two.
So you can come to either room,

12
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:45,540
um, for the event. Uh, Friday, may nine,

13
00:00:45,541 --> 00:00:48,870
two to five.
It has three parts.

14
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:54,360
The first part is identifications.
And that's small things from,

15
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:59,220
uh, any of the novels. That could be
a character. It could be a place name,

16
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:03,540
it could be a even a couple of words,
a quotation.

17
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:08,940
And you have to give the author and title
that it comes from of the book that it

18
00:01:08,941 --> 00:01:10,980
comes from. And, um,

19
00:01:10,981 --> 00:01:14,970
tell us what it is and a couple of
sentences about it's significant.

20
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:18,420
So why that thing is important.
Um,

21
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:23,900
passages will be little
chunks of text from a novel.

22
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:26,250
Again,
you'll have to know author and title,

23
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:31,590
and then you will have to do an
interpretation of the passage.

24
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:37,310
And then you have to say in a couple
of sentences how that passage as you've

25
00:01:37,681 --> 00:01:42,240
interpreted it is important
to the book as a whole.

26
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:47,820
Oh, and you have to say the context of
the passage. Now, this might differ.

27
00:01:47,821 --> 00:01:50,580
I'll give you a couple of examples.
This'll be different.

28
00:01:50,581 --> 00:01:55,170
It might be a matter of saying
where in the plot it occurs or,

29
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:58,570
uh, who, which characters speaking, um,

30
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:02,610
what's going on in the scene
from which it's, it's pulled, uh,

31
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:06,540
some sort of relevant context so that
we know that you understand where the

32
00:02:06,541 --> 00:02:09,040
thing comes from.
Um,

33
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:12,930
so you have 15 minutes
to do each of those. Um,

34
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,580
the essay is 40% of the,
of the final grade.

35
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:20,250
You have a half an hour,
and I'll show you,

36
00:02:20,251 --> 00:02:22,380
I have a special way
of doing these essays.

37
00:02:22,381 --> 00:02:25,590
Usually they're big general questions.
Um,

38
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:30,890
a good way to review for that is
to look at the old essay questions,

39
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,460
the essay topics.

40
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:38,070
You'll find a lot of clues there about
themes that unite all the works on the

41
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:41,730
syllabus.
So that can be a good way of studying.

42
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:46,140
In each of these sections
you will get to choose.

43
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:51,440
So in the ids usually give nine and you
get to choose six in the passages I aim

44
00:02:51,451 --> 00:02:56,340
for seven and you choose for in the
essays I always give three and you choose

45
00:02:56,341 --> 00:02:59,950
one.
Within the essays you can choose

46
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:05,440
to between two lists of books
to use to answer your questions.

47
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:10,090
Um, you get to choose three,
four on each of those two lists.

48
00:03:10,091 --> 00:03:13,000
And I'll explain a little bit why
I do that when I show you one.

49
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:19,620
The one restriction on the essay is
that you may only write about one novel

50
00:03:19,631 --> 00:03:21,610
you've written a long paper on.

51
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:26,470
So only one of the three novels that
you choose to write about for the essay

52
00:03:26,471 --> 00:03:29,560
question can be one that
you wrote about in a paper.

53
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:35,560
So your TF who will be grading the
exam will know what you wrote on.

54
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:40,180
So just a observe that guideline. It's
written in the directions of the exam.

55
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:46,570
Um, now, so let me show you
now what these look like.

56
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:52,710
[inaudible]

57
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:05,840
um, first of all, I'm going to
give you a couple ideas and,

58
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:10,260
and we'll play a little game. Who
can identify this? So see horses.

59
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:16,710
Yes. No, I'm not going to call
you Sarah. That's not fair.

60
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:21,060
Only if they're all washed up.

61
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:26,310
Can anyone except Sarah identify this?

62
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,460
Okay. Sarah, go ahead.

63
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:34,780
How's
grandfather your grandfather?

64
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,473
She always wants to,

65
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:42,720
that's right. Okay. Did that seem hard

66
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,680
judging by the Paucity of
answers? It was, um, yes,

67
00:04:49,681 --> 00:04:51,060
that's exactly what you need to say.

68
00:04:51,061 --> 00:04:54,000
You need to say Maryland
Ha Robinson housekeeping.

69
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:56,330
And you'd have to explain that.
Um,

70
00:04:56,370 --> 00:05:00,090
she always wanted to look at this little
drawing that her husband made for her.

71
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:04,590
Um, let me think of another
one. The dancing bear.

72
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:07,363
Yeah.

73
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,690
More of, you know that. Yes. I one

74
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:12,800
is it girl?

75
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:20,880
Okay. Yes, very good. So you,
that's the end of blood meridian.

76
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:25,320
You would have to say that it's at the
very end in order to get full credit for

77
00:05:25,321 --> 00:05:29,910
that Id. So you need to know that.
Um, let me think of another Oh,

78
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
lane as a name.
Lean.

79
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,633
Yes,

80
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:43,440
yes, absolutely. And you might
want to say what he represents.

81
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:44,730
So what,

82
00:05:44,731 --> 00:05:48,390
what would he represent if you were
gonna give us a sentence about what he

83
00:05:48,391 --> 00:05:51,150
represents. What would you
say? Why he's important?

84
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:59,150
Kind of, uh, the editor,
the like the education,

85
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:03,620
our education system and the, um, I
forget what the exact word they use,

86
00:06:03,621 --> 00:06:08,621
but the views that I'm Franny thinks
that education like that I think is

87
00:06:09,051 --> 00:06:11,480
pointless. It doesn't lead
to wisdom. And he is, um,

88
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:16,420
expanding upon all these points for
being basically just gets rough.

89
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:20,230
This readings. Yes. He
doesn't actually understand.

90
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:26,100
Yes, that's true. And he's pretentious. So
he's much more interested in, in his, uh,

91
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:31,400
possibilities for publication and how
well he's done in his course than he is in

92
00:06:31,651 --> 00:06:35,790
the wisdom that Franny and
Zooey both value. Okay. Yes.

93
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:39,750
So you get the idea. Um,
that's what an ideas.

94
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:45,200
So now let me show you a passage
and we'll do some of these.

95
00:06:46,471 --> 00:06:47,670
Now,
the important thing

96
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:54,350
about passages is that you talk about
the language of the passage as well as

97
00:06:58,231 --> 00:06:59,160
just what's in it.

98
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:04,820
So these will be chosen for the interest
of their language and you will want to

99
00:07:06,211 --> 00:07:11,100
note the words and talk about why
things are said the way they're set.

100
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:15,540
Whoops, what do I need my mute. Okay,

101
00:07:15,541 --> 00:07:17,910
so here's one take a moment.

102
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,960
Now is the time.
And folks I just couldn't in silence,

103
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:27,690
I turned Shorewood and
gravely due to flee.

104
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:32,810
She also turned and still health screen
bits council and still I could not make

105
00:07:33,181 --> 00:07:37,290
myself drown. The poor,
slippery, big bodied creature.

106
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:38,790
What is this from

107
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:45,600
[inaudible]?

108
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,910
Yes. And what's, what is
going on in the scene?

109
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:52,720
Humbert is contemplating joining
Charlotte like hourglass.

110
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:54,400
Very good. Yes. Um,

111
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:59,570
that's all the context you would
need to identify this passage.

112
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:02,240
Now take a minute and look,

113
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:07,570
what do you think in the language of this
passage would be useful to comment on?

114
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:13,340
What do you notice about
it? But the language? Yes.

115
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:17,300
Using folks. Yes. He's
addressing, absolutely.

116
00:08:17,301 --> 00:08:21,260
You would have to talk about that to get
full credit for an answer on this one.

117
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,480
Um, it's an address to the reader. You'd
need to talk about why he says that.

118
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:29,320
So what would your account
be for why he says that?

119
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:34,950
Because he's making tea for his innocence
and he's addressing people in informal

120
00:08:35,021 --> 00:08:38,380
manner to try and sort of reach them on a,
on a friendship.

121
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:39,993
Exactly.

122
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:43,290
Yeah. And he just wants to do is
create a picture of his own mortality.

123
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:47,130
Okay. Yes. Very good. That's
a very nice way of putting it.

124
00:08:47,131 --> 00:08:50,740
When you say he's making a plea
for his innocence, that, uh,

125
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:54,150
is the whole context of the novel.
That's what sets up the novel.

126
00:08:54,151 --> 00:08:58,680
That's the frame of novel.
And so just by making that observation,

127
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:02,340
you've done an important thing
for the passage I notifications,

128
00:09:02,341 --> 00:09:07,110
which is that you have drawn its
significance in the context of the larger

129
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:08,670
novel,
the whole novel.

130
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:13,560
What else might warrant your notice here?

131
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:17,890
What other bits of the language?

132
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:21,390
Yes.
Big bodied creature.

133
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,970
Yes.
What about that

134
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:29,290
opposition he sets up with John's body
release his body and the body Pesto?

135
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:35,120
Absolutely. Yes. So that's, that
would be perfect. Nice and economical.

136
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:38,000
What else?
What else do you see there

137
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:44,670
that you could comment on?
Yes.

138
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:49,890
The now is the time with the
exclamation mark. Almost as like a hero.

139
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:55,760
Yes. Yeah. And what would you
make of that in an answer?

140
00:09:56,620 --> 00:10:00,300
We'll do it as much as he's trying
to prove his innocence. He also, Yup.

141
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:03,000
We're really thinks of actually
getting the right thing.

142
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:06,260
Yes.
Well we're laughing about it.

143
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:11,000
You would probably want to note that
it's a comic use of that literary

144
00:10:11,001 --> 00:10:16,001
convention and so you could say something
about his deployment of conventional

145
00:10:16,611 --> 00:10:20,180
language,
either for satirical use or for,

146
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:25,360
for comedy or to play up the drama of his,

147
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:30,350
um, self understanding. So
that would be a nicer point.

148
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:35,580
Somewhat more subtle observation.
Um, that would set, uh,

149
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:40,340
your exam, grading, TF, uh,
into a state of happiness.

150
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:45,200
Much to be desired. All right, let me see.

151
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:47,600
Show you another one.

152
00:10:57,250 --> 00:11:01,030
Okay. This one, take a minute and read it.

153
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,233
Right.

154
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,350
Okay.
What's this from?

155
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,353
Okay.

156
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:39,560
Known world.
Okay.

157
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:44,610
Sometimes we will take
out character names. Ah,

158
00:11:44,611 --> 00:11:49,611
I've done this with at a pie in the past
in crying flop 49 just because it's so,

159
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:55,600
uh, so identified with that. It seems
like too much of a dead giveaway.

160
00:11:55,810 --> 00:12:00,640
I don't do that very often here.
Augustus is an easy identifier.

161
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:04,390
Um, what would you want
to say about this passage?

162
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:07,240
What do you notice about it
that seems worth accounting for?

163
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:22,720
Hmm, probably, um, with the
phrase, I know what I know.

164
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:26,410
I'm connected to the title
of the known world. Yep.

165
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:32,200
We can make a comment about how our
world is defined by what we know and the

166
00:12:32,981 --> 00:12:34,780
perception of God's truth
and how that fits in.

167
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:37,170
Absolutely. Yeah. And if you,

168
00:12:37,171 --> 00:12:42,171
if you could tie that notion of God's
truth to the godlike omniscience of the

169
00:12:43,711 --> 00:12:46,410
narrator in the known world,
that would be a great thing to do.

170
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:52,070
And that would be way to tie your analysis
of this passage to the concerns of

171
00:12:52,441 --> 00:12:55,110
the novel as a whole.
So that would be good to do.

172
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:57,620
What else do you notice
that you could make use of

173
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:01,570
thematically or formally?
Here

174
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:16,543
you lie.

175
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:21,670
It's like the barriers
to achieving the morale,

176
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:26,450
vision, morality, like, um, uh, uh,

177
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:31,290
military and ready,
kind of dream of treating slaves like,

178
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,673
like,

179
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:37,720
like his children and they end
up acting all his lightsaber

180
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:44,360
saying the same thing.
There should be a light that light isn't

181
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:49,410
right. So both in the, in your
example of Mildred and uh, uh,

182
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:54,740
uh, Mildred and Henry, not
Mildred, um, Henry and I'm

183
00:13:57,170 --> 00:14:01,990
now I've lost her name. What is her
name? His wife's name? Oh, no. Caledonia,

184
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:02,990
um,

185
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:07,990
Henry and Caledonia have this vision of
a pure morality that they could sponsor

186
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:13,760
in their slave holding
life. And similarly, um,

187
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:17,840
this is, um, Barnum, Kinsey speaking.

188
00:14:17,841 --> 00:14:21,170
You'd want to identify the speaker here,
Barnum Kinsey,

189
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:27,820
dreams of a pure space in which he
could do the morally right thing.

190
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,040
But as Eli was saying,

191
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:34,670
this is a novel in which no
such space or light as possible.

192
00:14:34,671 --> 00:14:37,310
So you'd want to note that,
um,

193
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:42,740
that's more of a thematic element of this,

194
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:45,710
but you would want to note
that that's really important.

195
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:49,730
Anything else that we might want to say?
Yes.

196
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:50,640
Oh Wow.

197
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:54,860
In the language she repeats a body to
say in a body should stand and it's kind

198
00:14:54,861 --> 00:14:59,861
of a way of preventing literary means
of decoration or like I know where it,

199
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:06,160
yeah, I think you can
definitely talk about that.

200
00:15:06,161 --> 00:15:07,360
I think there are a couple of ways.

201
00:15:07,361 --> 00:15:12,361
One is to associate it with literacy so
that just being as a way of testifying

202
00:15:12,701 --> 00:15:14,350
somehow,
um,

203
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:18,490
that Barnum and behaving the way
he would've wanted to behave,

204
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:22,660
um,
could have done the moral thing.

205
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:27,900
But there's a contrast here between
saying it being the moral thing and his

206
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:34,500
having stood by as a body in that scene
and allowed Augustus to be sold into

207
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:37,720
slavery.
Um,

208
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:42,750
so you could certainly make hay
of that elocution and for any um,

209
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:48,910
example that uses dialect in this way,
you do want to interrogate it.

210
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,980
So don't just say,
well that's,

211
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:56,280
I'm just trying to sound like someone
would sound like in this social situation,

212
00:15:57,850 --> 00:15:58,880
don't stop there.

213
00:15:58,881 --> 00:16:03,880
That know that the passages will be chosen
so that any irregularity of language,

214
00:16:03,881 --> 00:16:07,420
even if it's for the purposes
of realism in dialect,

215
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:10,210
is probably going to be
something you can talk about.

216
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:16,050
So just be aware of that and creative
in thinking about what that variation in

217
00:16:17,891 --> 00:16:21,460
language could mean. Okay.
Let me show you another,

218
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:13,170
okay. What's that from? Yes,
yes. It's from on the road.

219
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:14,790
And what would you want to say about it?

220
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:17,913
Yeah.

221
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:21,760
What's important to notice about the
language and what's important in the

222
00:17:21,761 --> 00:17:24,750
thematic of it?
In the content of it.

223
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:26,773
Yeah.

224
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,440
Yes sir.
We'll work on it.

225
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:38,900
We could talk about

226
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,260
like this unique sort of
speech and how I'm threatening,

227
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:52,570
which attempts to sort of like Regis
on site cause some kind of truth by I'm

228
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:56,730
getting at like intuitive understanding.

229
00:17:58,340 --> 00:17:59,390
Yeah,
absolutely.

230
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:04,510
So words like that you'd need to talk
about Dean's language and just as Sarah

231
00:18:04,851 --> 00:18:05,684
has done,

232
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:09,110
put it in the context of our understanding
of Dean's language and its evolution

233
00:18:09,111 --> 00:18:10,220
over the course of the novel.

234
00:18:10,221 --> 00:18:14,870
So that does the work of getting your
interpretation into the context of an

235
00:18:14,871 --> 00:18:18,110
entire interpretation of the novel.
Um,

236
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:21,200
and there is that sense of immediacy.

237
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:25,340
So making up words and attempt
to get at a, at an, uh,

238
00:18:25,341 --> 00:18:29,690
an unusual proximity to experience.
Okay.

239
00:18:29,691 --> 00:18:31,670
What else would you want to notice?

240
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:32,763
Okay,

241
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:46,440
well what's he talking about?

242
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:50,800
Okay.
Yes,

243
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:55,690
yes.
Uh,

244
00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:02,100
[inaudible].

245
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:08,700
Okay. Yes. Specially in what, sorry.

246
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:10,350
Yeah.
The last one we did.

247
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:13,720
Yeah, absolutely. The,

248
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:17,860
the language and the way Dean's language
falls apart over the course of the

249
00:19:17,861 --> 00:19:21,610
novel is one way that he's trying to
get at a different kind of language.

250
00:19:21,611 --> 00:19:23,140
But music is the figure for the,

251
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:27,940
for another way or it's another figure
for that effort to get beyond the

252
00:19:27,941 --> 00:19:29,290
limitations of language.

253
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:32,980
And here the way jazz is being described,

254
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:36,520
its ability to capture
some ineffable thing.

255
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:41,140
It is what you'd want to highlight.

256
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:47,130
So you want to connect that analysis of
how jazz is being described here with

257
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:52,810
the role of jazz in the novel as a whole,
especially in the novels,

258
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:56,590
uh, linguistic ambitions.
It's literary ambitions.

259
00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:02,500
Um, you might want to notice
the empty space that's,

260
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:04,930
that's, um, highlighted here.

261
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:10,350
It's another version of the vagueness of
spirituality in a couple of our novels.

262
00:20:10,901 --> 00:20:14,230
On the syllabus. Um, but
certainly in on the road,

263
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:18,640
the vagueness of that thing
that they are looking for. Um,

264
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:20,260
and also you could,

265
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:25,290
you could talk about the communal dynamics
of meaning making here and you could

266
00:20:28,371 --> 00:20:33,371
connect that with how it's important
that Sao and dean operate in this larger

267
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:41,960
set of people that sort of ebb
and flow throughout the novel.

268
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:47,210
This is not the individual
artists sitting alone,

269
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:52,620
but rather a dream of an American
identity that is somehow built in a free

270
00:20:56,111 --> 00:20:59,980
thinking community of people or a
free acting community of people.

271
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:03,220
So you get that in all of a sudden
somewhere in the middle of the course,

272
00:21:03,221 --> 00:21:03,880
he gets it,

273
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:08,880
everybody looks up and knows there's a
dream there of a shared meaning making

274
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:10,293
moment

275
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:14,590
that everyone will know it
will be immediately compelling.

276
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:16,383
Okay.

277
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:20,220
Rehashes of old blowing it.

278
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:24,960
He's talking about how jazz musicians
are in conversation with the tradition.

279
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:29,730
You could use that little piece and talk
about the way that on the road is in

280
00:21:29,731 --> 00:21:33,600
conversation with other
literary traditions.

281
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:38,940
How it imagines itself as a
revision of modernism. Uh,

282
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:43,740
we had a wonderful paper that I think
some of you saw as a sample about, um,

283
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:44,781
uh,

284
00:21:44,781 --> 00:21:49,781
about the relationship between
Hemingway and Kerouac in this novel.

285
00:21:50,641 --> 00:21:53,610
I didn't lecture on this, but if you,
any of you saw that paper, that's a,

286
00:21:53,611 --> 00:21:56,440
that's an example of what
you might want to say, uh,

287
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:59,700
about the relationship between
tradition and innovation,

288
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:03,630
which is theater based here in jazz,
but it's acted out in the novel as well.

289
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:08,610
Okay. Do you get the idea of how
these work? Okay, so this is,

290
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:13,440
this is what I'm looking for in
the passages now in the essays.

291
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:28,633
Okay.

292
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:35,690
Usually we have extremely broad questions,

293
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:40,940
some of which are more theoretical
than others. Some are more thematic,

294
00:22:40,941 --> 00:22:43,460
like we had one,
I'll show you in a minute about work.

295
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:46,670
It's looks quite different
from this one. But, um,

296
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:50,360
here's the question often said that many
of the humanistic disciplines of the

297
00:22:50,361 --> 00:22:54,410
second half of the 20th century or march
by their interest in language itself,

298
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:58,160
in other words, language becomes
not just a medium but a problem.

299
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:02,540
To what extent are the problems
of language foregrounded
in the novels of this

300
00:23:02,541 --> 00:23:06,350
period? What are the consequences of
this turn for the writing of fiction?

301
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:10,550
How does such a foregrounding affect the
traditional terms of the novel concerns

302
00:23:10,551 --> 00:23:12,680
of the novel,
the creation of character,

303
00:23:12,681 --> 00:23:16,880
the relationship between style and
content, problems of various militude,

304
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:21,920
etc. Now you would have to choose one
of those groups and then within one of

305
00:23:22,821 --> 00:23:27,821
those groups of novels you would need to
choose three of the four to talk about.

306
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:32,360
So the essay will be bringing together
three novels around one of these

307
00:23:32,361 --> 00:23:33,200
questions.

308
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:38,780
The reason I grouped them this way is
because some of the novels on the syllabus

309
00:23:39,170 --> 00:23:44,170
you could put together and have a very
partial account of fiction in this period

310
00:23:46,311 --> 00:23:50,570
looks like.
So say your novels were um,

311
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:55,960
Barth pension and for all of them
have very similar formal ambitions.

312
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,750
Kay. I would not make it
possible for you to do that.

313
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:09,280
So I'm looking for you to be able to
take texts that seem unlike in their

314
00:24:09,771 --> 00:24:14,771
concerns and in their formal elements
and put them into conversation with each

315
00:24:15,351 --> 00:24:20,030
other around a particular
question. Okay. Similarly,

316
00:24:20,031 --> 00:24:24,200
I would not ask you to
do, um, woman warrior,

317
00:24:24,201 --> 00:24:26,270
bluest eye and known world.

318
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:30,271
Um,

319
00:24:30,271 --> 00:24:35,271
I wouldn't ask you to do probably woman
warrior Blewis die and human stain

320
00:24:35,701 --> 00:24:36,534
either.

321
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:37,720
Yeah.

322
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,820
It's all too much about identity.

323
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:41,220
Yeah.

324
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:43,710
In,
in somewhat similar terms.

325
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:49,550
So I wouldn't ask you those
novels together so you can
see that I mix them up.

326
00:24:50,010 --> 00:24:52,770
Don't forget black boy
that will be on the exam.

327
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:56,160
If you join the course in
the middle of reading week,

328
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:57,990
I mean not in the middle
of shopping period.

329
00:24:58,170 --> 00:25:01,920
You might want to go back and
fill that in to your reading.

330
00:25:01,921 --> 00:25:05,880
If you haven't read that. Um, let's see.

331
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:09,240
Questions about,
about the essay questions.

332
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:16,420
Okay.

333
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:20,320
I highly, highly recommend that
you take the time to outline,

334
00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:24,850
um, if you're not used to taking
essay exams or even if you are,

335
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:28,960
it is a huge help.
It's actually a time saver.

336
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:33,430
It ensures that you don't get bogged
down in sentence constructions.

337
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:36,460
When we grade these,
um,

338
00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:41,490
typically what we do is make checks in
the margin every time you make a specific

339
00:25:41,981 --> 00:25:46,981
point and use a specific citation
of a specific part of a novel.

340
00:25:47,530 --> 00:25:52,090
So you can't quote because you don't
have the books in front of us in front of

341
00:25:52,091 --> 00:25:56,290
you. Although if you do want to
use passages that are on the exam,

342
00:25:56,291 --> 00:25:57,550
you can quote from those.

343
00:25:58,030 --> 00:26:02,080
You can use parts of the exam
for quotation in the essay.

344
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:05,620
Um, but you do need to say, you know,

345
00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:11,010
when Morrison starts each chapter of the
bluest eye with that quotation from the

346
00:26:11,951 --> 00:26:12,784
primer,

347
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:18,660
she's highlighting how learning
languages also learning a kind of racial

348
00:26:19,541 --> 00:26:20,374
prejudice.

349
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:28,230
And it's a kind of racial prejudice
rooted in aesthetic appreciation.

350
00:26:28,231 --> 00:26:33,231
She highlights the colors that appear in
the primer and the prettiness of jeans

351
00:26:35,041 --> 00:26:39,090
dresses. Okay. I didn't quote
anything from the Bluest Tie,

352
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:43,890
but I'm pointing to it in such a way that
that would have several in the column

353
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:45,683
in the margin.

354
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:51,530
And basically what we do is we rack it
up and we see whether for each novel

355
00:26:51,661 --> 00:26:55,680
you've made a number of specific
points that add up to an argument.

356
00:26:55,681 --> 00:27:00,080
Now in this essay, this is
the only place where, um,

357
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:03,390
we really don't want you
simply coughing up lecture

358
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:09,470
or something that you've discussed
in section. This is like the papers,

359
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:13,520
something of an opportunity to draw
things together in an original way.

360
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:18,670
There are lots of threads that
connect the novels in the syllabus.

361
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,840
If you've been attending the lectures,

362
00:27:20,841 --> 00:27:25,841
you will already have lots of those in
your notes so you can draw from that,

363
00:27:25,971 --> 00:27:30,520
but you should be thinking about it
on your own for the passages. Um,

364
00:27:30,521 --> 00:27:35,521
when you start to make claims about why
the passage is important in the context

365
00:27:35,691 --> 00:27:36,740
of the novel as a whole,

366
00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:41,120
you may find yourself using arguments
that were made in lecture or in section

367
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,740
and that's fine.

368
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:49,370
So it gives you the larger context in
which you can show us that you're able to

369
00:27:50,071 --> 00:27:54,510
look at the specific words on the
page and tell us something about them.

370
00:27:55,410 --> 00:27:59,850
That's the skill we're testing in the
passages here. It's more your synthetic,

371
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:03,390
um, knowledge and your way
of bringing things together.

372
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:08,940
So in studying for the exam portion,
as I say,

373
00:28:08,941 --> 00:28:13,740
read over the paper topics and make a
little list for yourself of kinds of

374
00:28:13,741 --> 00:28:18,741
evidence that you would point to maybe
four or five bits of evidence for each

375
00:28:20,431 --> 00:28:25,431
novel or for a number of novels that
might help you answer a question like that

376
00:28:25,921 --> 00:28:29,940
on the exam or sit and think,
you know,

377
00:28:29,941 --> 00:28:32,100
read a question and think
to your mind, okay, which,

378
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:35,850
which scenes what I note which scenes,
what I want to talk about.

379
00:28:35,851 --> 00:28:38,090
That's a good exercise,
um,

380
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:43,230
for studying any questions about this?

381
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:44,490
Okay.
Let me show you one more.

382
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:50,790
So that's a very sort of,
um,

383
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:55,530
literary kind of version
of the exam question.

384
00:28:55,531 --> 00:29:00,420
Let me show you something of a more,
perhaps a cultural studies version.

385
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:07,330
Here's one about work. The quotation
is from plot against America,

386
00:29:07,331 --> 00:29:12,160
Philip Roth's recent novel,
which is what I taught of his last year.

387
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:16,510
So that obviously would,
would not occur on our exam.

388
00:29:18,610 --> 00:29:21,490
The men worked 50 60 even
70 or more hours a week.

389
00:29:21,491 --> 00:29:24,970
The women worked all the time with little
assistance from labor saving devices,

390
00:29:24,971 --> 00:29:29,740
discuss the status of work in the post
1945 American novel who works and who

391
00:29:29,741 --> 00:29:34,000
doesn't, how is work represented,
what kinds of work are valorized,

392
00:29:34,001 --> 00:29:37,600
what kinds are vilified, what is
the place of labor in these novels,

393
00:29:37,601 --> 00:29:39,160
vision of America.

394
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:44,350
So that's more thematic question.
But in all of these,

395
00:29:44,351 --> 00:29:48,550
we really want you to be noting
how narratives are put together,

396
00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:51,130
how language is used,

397
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:56,320
what choices the novel made in privileging
either description of character and

398
00:29:56,321 --> 00:29:59,920
development of character,
development of setting

399
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:05,320
creativity in voices and tones.

400
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:09,910
So all those formal things that have to
do with language choices would still be

401
00:30:09,911 --> 00:30:11,110
relevant here.

402
00:30:11,111 --> 00:30:15,670
You might want to talk about the work of
the writer as that novel imagines that

403
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:20,140
we've talked about that over on and
off over the course of the term.

404
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:22,420
What is the literary project?

405
00:30:22,870 --> 00:30:27,460
What does the literary project have
to do with other kinds of work?

406
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:34,303
Yeah,

407
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:37,500
so generally, uh, partly
because this course is,

408
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:39,830
is cross listed in American studies.

409
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:44,570
I like to have something of a balance
between those very literary formal

410
00:30:44,571 --> 00:30:48,260
questions like that first one I showed
you and this one which is a little bit

411
00:30:48,261 --> 00:30:52,910
more, a little bit more
about a vision of America.

412
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:54,850
Yeah.

413
00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:56,020
Okay.
Any questions?

414
00:30:56,830 --> 00:30:57,663
Okay.

415
00:30:59,530 --> 00:31:04,420
You probably have your,
um, probably have your

416
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,000
okay.

417
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Ways of studying. Um, by now,

418
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:12,840
even freshman have been here for a year.
Um,

419
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:17,820
let me just say a couple things about
the process of studying and taking exams

420
00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:22,620
that maybe will be helpful
to you. Um, my, my,

421
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:23,813
uh,

422
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:29,540
ideal way of studying for
an exam is to you sleep.

423
00:31:32,630 --> 00:31:32,870
Yeah.

424
00:31:32,870 --> 00:31:34,700
Do you sleep strategically?

425
00:31:35,570 --> 00:31:39,860
Sleep can do amazing things for the
consolidation of knowledge in your brain.

426
00:31:40,850 --> 00:31:43,730
Maybe some of you have
discovered this already. Um,

427
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:46,880
maybe some of you have
discovered it's negative.

428
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:50,240
What it does not do for
you when you do not sleep,

429
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:55,790
if you can arrange it
so that you spend time.

430
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:59,930
So you get all your reading done,
read over all your notes,

431
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:03,980
then sit down with those paper topics

432
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,060
and while you're sitting
with the paper topics,

433
00:32:08,061 --> 00:32:13,061
that's when you move from going from
the passive mode to the active mode.

434
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:14,750
So you review all your notes,

435
00:32:15,530 --> 00:32:20,270
sit down with the paper topics in that
active mode. Do what I was suggesting.

436
00:32:20,570 --> 00:32:25,550
Think of scenes that pertain to those
topics for a number of the novels for each

437
00:32:25,551 --> 00:32:29,990
one. Just work through that for
awhile until you can't do it anymore.

438
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:34,160
And then go to sleep right away.
Do not check your email.

439
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:39,230
Do not browse the web. Do not shoot
the breeze with your roommate.

440
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:41,630
Just go to bed.

441
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:46,600
There's a lot of research
that's been done about, um,

442
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:51,140
the effect of doing this
without distracting yourself.

443
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:56,320
You still get a benefit if you
distract yourself and then go to bed.

444
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:00,410
You still retain more of the
knowledge the next morning,

445
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:03,530
but it's even better if you do
it without distracting yourself.

446
00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:05,020
Yeah.

447
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:09,850
So take it to bed with you so you can
sync right into bed, into sleep later.

448
00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:12,250
Even if you can only now,

449
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:17,470
even for 20 minutes or half an hour,
it still has an effect.

450
00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:21,040
So say you've only got,
you know,

451
00:33:21,041 --> 00:33:24,280
you have to study for this exam during
one half of the day and then you have to

452
00:33:24,281 --> 00:33:27,670
go and take another exam during
the second half of the day.

453
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:32,020
Take a nap in between.
It's probably worth the half hour.

454
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:36,460
You don't spend thinking about more
paper topics or reading your notes over

455
00:33:36,461 --> 00:33:40,480
again are looking at the novels to
do that. It's probably worth it.

456
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:46,120
Okay. So that's my first tip. You
sleep strategically. My second,

457
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:50,140
uh, reflection on exam
taking is that, um, you may,

458
00:33:50,170 --> 00:33:53,830
you may dismiss this out of hand given
the profession that I then took up,

459
00:33:54,010 --> 00:33:56,170
but I actually used to like taking exams.

460
00:33:56,680 --> 00:34:01,680
And the reason was that once you went
through that work of reading things over,

461
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:07,360
processing it after you
took the exam itself,

462
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:10,810
I always felt that the knowledge
of a course was really my own.

463
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:12,790
Then it came together in a,

464
00:34:12,970 --> 00:34:17,970
in a way that was much more solid
for me then before I took the exam.

465
00:34:18,970 --> 00:34:23,970
So right now the themes of the course
might just be a collection of memories or

466
00:34:24,101 --> 00:34:27,640
partial memories and in your
notes and sort of chaotic.

467
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:33,780
But once you study for the exam and you
get some distance from it with sleep and

468
00:34:34,811 --> 00:34:38,050
you actually write the exam,
that knowledge is really your own.

469
00:34:38,051 --> 00:34:41,770
So I would encourage you to see
exam period, not just in this class,

470
00:34:41,771 --> 00:34:45,400
but in all your classes as a real time,

471
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:48,700
an important time of consolidation.

472
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:52,450
You worked very hard during
the term in all your classes.

473
00:34:52,451 --> 00:34:57,451
I hope and whatever you did can really
become yours in a new way during this

474
00:35:00,101 --> 00:35:05,080
time. So use it well and uh, and
I hope that you'll in some way,

475
00:35:05,081 --> 00:35:09,640
some part of you will enjoy that process
of, of really coming to own that,

476
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:13,360
that knowledge. Okay. Any
questions about the exam?

477
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:15,133
Okay.

478
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:20,350
Okay. Any questions about
anything in the course?

479
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:35,960
You lie.
Why do you say,

480
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,100
talk a little bit about

481
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:41,910
this first day,
but 1945 like particularly like what's

482
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:47,350
why post war well in America that
marks, um, two things for me.

483
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:51,780
One is the rise of the mass
market and that changes,

484
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:53,200
well actually I would say three things.

485
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:58,690
The rise of the mass market changes the
relationship between readership and the

486
00:35:58,691 --> 00:36:03,580
literature that's out there. So used
to be that, um, high literature, uh,

487
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:05,620
was not published in paperback,

488
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:11,230
but the rise of the mass market paperback
men that suddenly books that would

489
00:36:11,231 --> 00:36:16,231
never be accessible to a sort of average
middle class or working class person

490
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:17,860
suddenly became so,

491
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:24,150
so it's a huge watershed in
the demographics of leadership.

492
00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:30,190
So that's one reason. A second
reason is related to this. Um,

493
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:32,230
and that's that

494
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:39,360
hundreds of thousands of men came back
and went to college on the Gi bill who

495
00:36:39,881 --> 00:36:41,260
had never been to college before.

496
00:36:41,261 --> 00:36:43,660
Nobody in their families had
ever been to college before.

497
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:48,100
This also changed the readership
dramatically. It was a time of enormous,

498
00:36:48,490 --> 00:36:52,180
um, uh, an enormous boom
in college enrollments.

499
00:36:52,181 --> 00:36:56,740
And part of that was a huge
boom in English enrollments.

500
00:36:57,610 --> 00:37:02,610
Literature was a way for people who had
never been to college before to feel

501
00:37:04,571 --> 00:37:09,160
that they were entering into the upper
middle class because it was a kind of

502
00:37:09,161 --> 00:37:14,161
pursuit that was marked by its bourgeois
prestige or its prestige marked,

503
00:37:17,830 --> 00:37:19,990
uh,
you as bourgeois.

504
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:26,290
So for people interested in raising
their class status and it was lots of

505
00:37:26,291 --> 00:37:29,320
people, um, coming into
the educational system,

506
00:37:29,321 --> 00:37:34,300
higher education for the first time
literature was very important. Um,

507
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:39,540
there's a whole story about why
literature is no longer that class marking

508
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:46,030
enterprise that it was it mid century.
Um,

509
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:51,060
that has to do with the rise of writing
the competence in writing being more

510
00:37:51,221 --> 00:37:55,510
important than the competence in literary
tradition to mark you as an educated

511
00:37:55,511 --> 00:37:59,350
person.
So that's an interesting story in itself.

512
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:01,630
But um,
in general,

513
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:05,290
1945 is the beginning of that.
Um,

514
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:09,040
the third thing is that by 1945,

515
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:13,240
the innovations of modernism are
really very well established.

516
00:38:13,241 --> 00:38:18,241
The big careers of early century literary
enterprise are totally established and

517
00:38:19,961 --> 00:38:24,580
they have been assumed almost
fully into the institution.

518
00:38:24,581 --> 00:38:27,310
Of the university through
the new criticism.

519
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:31,720
The new criticism was that method
of reading literature that was,

520
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:35,920
um,
determining how people were in classrooms,

521
00:38:35,921 --> 00:38:40,420
how all those new college students
were reading in classrooms, um,

522
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:45,940
that set the agenda for
what would come next.

523
00:38:45,941 --> 00:38:50,500
So in that context, someone
like John Barth trained, uh,

524
00:38:50,510 --> 00:38:55,510
IX intensively in the new criticism had
to decide what he was going to do as

525
00:38:57,980 --> 00:39:01,540
literarily ambitious writer to innovate.

526
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:07,710
So it was a question of how could
literature carry on and do something new.

527
00:39:08,770 --> 00:39:13,510
And there are lots of different answers
to that. And another answer to it. Um,

528
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:19,030
that is partly the result of the
Gi bill explosion of education.

529
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:24,220
That's the changing demographic of who
gets to read and who gets to write. Um,

530
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,240
so women,

531
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:30,420
people of color began to
change the agendas of modernism
simply by getting that

532
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:33,070
education and entering into the academy.

533
00:39:33,071 --> 00:39:37,540
So Toni Morrison is a great example of
that. Um, so as Maxine Hong Kingston,

534
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:43,230
there was this sense that modernism
had not even begun to touch on the

535
00:39:43,391 --> 00:39:48,391
experience of vast swathes of society
and writers like Morrison and,

536
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:54,370
and Kingston.
We're very busy wanting to rectify that.

537
00:39:55,420 --> 00:40:00,340
So it marks a change that's beyond
just a change in readership.

538
00:40:00,341 --> 00:40:04,120
The demographic change in readership
and an education really begins to change

539
00:40:04,121 --> 00:40:09,100
the agenda of literature. So
that's why 45 is my, my marker.

540
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:14,260
It's a crude while I'm like all these
things, you know, you can't say, well,

541
00:40:14,261 --> 00:40:17,650
why not? 1942, you know,
it doesn't quite work.

542
00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:21,370
Work that specifically.
Okay. Other questions?

543
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:28,170
Well,
the course about terms about books,

544
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:34,410
yes. Of the novels. We read one of your,

545
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:40,270
you do, do you? Hmm.

546
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:45,850
Gosh, that's really, really hard.
Um, I do love the known world.

547
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:47,770
I really admire it.
Um,

548
00:40:48,490 --> 00:40:53,470
I think it's genuinely doing something
new and that's hard to do right now.

549
00:40:54,670 --> 00:40:57,730
Um, so I love it and I loved
it as a reading experience.

550
00:40:57,731 --> 00:41:01,920
Even when I first read it, it
really captured my imagination. Um,

551
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:04,690
I've always loved and
hated blood Meridian.

552
00:41:04,990 --> 00:41:09,040
I love and hate Cormac McCarthy. I've
spent a lot of time thinking about him,

553
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:12,400
writing about him,
reading his work.

554
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:16,370
And while I'm really,
uh,

555
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:19,630
in awe of his ability,

556
00:41:19,690 --> 00:41:24,610
especially to use the far reaches
of our vocabulary in English,

557
00:41:24,611 --> 00:41:29,080
I mean, talk about someone who
really makes room in the language.

558
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:34,370
Um, he can really do that. If you
read the first few pages of a,

559
00:41:34,371 --> 00:41:37,550
of one of his, um,
earlier novels, such tree,

560
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:40,400
you get a fantastic image of this.

561
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:44,240
It's a very Joycey and novel
that won the vocabulary.

562
00:41:44,241 --> 00:41:46,640
You just have to look up
like every third word.

563
00:41:46,641 --> 00:41:51,410
It's really incredible and I'm really
interested in the way he is focused on

564
00:41:51,411 --> 00:41:54,890
craft, both as a writer but
all kinds of crafts, crafts.

565
00:41:54,891 --> 00:41:59,470
Like he has this play called
the last stone mason. Uh,

566
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:02,510
I think it's called the last last
John Mason. We're just the Stonemason,

567
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,490
the stonemason.
Um,

568
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:09,140
he's interested in these old arts
like physical arts, like forging.

569
00:42:09,141 --> 00:42:12,300
There's a great chapter on, um, on, uh,

570
00:42:12,350 --> 00:42:17,350
smithing in a novel called the Child of
God where the language of of the Smithy

571
00:42:18,830 --> 00:42:21,680
is folded into this.
Um,

572
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:27,400
meditation on aesthetics talks about what
color the fire and the metal should be

573
00:42:27,531 --> 00:42:30,830
at every moment of reforging an ax handle.

574
00:42:30,831 --> 00:42:32,720
Of course in true McCarthy's style,

575
00:42:32,721 --> 00:42:37,440
the ax handle will then be used
to chop up dead bodies and,

576
00:42:37,490 --> 00:42:42,230
and skin people. Uh, so
that's very McCarthy ask too,

577
00:42:42,590 --> 00:42:47,330
but at the same time I just find
him frustratingly empty. Um,

578
00:42:47,630 --> 00:42:51,080
the road I adored,
it was a terrifying read.

579
00:42:51,081 --> 00:42:55,640
I had insomnia one night and I started
to read it at about one 30 in the morning

580
00:42:55,641 --> 00:43:00,480
and I finished it about five 30
and I was terrified. Um, it's,

581
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:04,100
have I told you about the road
when it's about, it takes,

582
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:09,160
it takes place 10 years into a nuclear
winter and it's about a father and son

583
00:43:09,321 --> 00:43:14,321
making their way down from Appalachia
to the Gulf coast for no apparent reason

584
00:43:15,021 --> 00:43:19,370
except that the father seems to think
that somehow there'll be able to survive

585
00:43:19,371 --> 00:43:22,280
better once they get to the coast.
Um,

586
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,040
meanwhile in this world,

587
00:43:25,041 --> 00:43:28,580
there are all these cannibalistic
gangs that have started.

588
00:43:28,910 --> 00:43:33,290
A women are used to produce
babies that they then eat a,

589
00:43:33,291 --> 00:43:36,500
it's really completely
bleak and terrifying.

590
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:41,420
And that the relationship between the
father and the son is extremely touching,

591
00:43:41,650 --> 00:43:45,470
you know, and I have a little boy who
is about the same age and Oh my God,

592
00:43:45,471 --> 00:43:49,370
I was just doing, it was really
terrifying to read this, uh,

593
00:43:49,371 --> 00:43:53,690
all alone in the middle of the night,
I sort of got in bed with my son later.

594
00:43:53,691 --> 00:43:58,580
It is kind of cuddled with him, um,
to remember that he was still alive.

595
00:43:59,030 --> 00:43:59,863
But,
um,

596
00:44:00,110 --> 00:44:05,110
at the end there's this sense
of the boy carrying the light.

597
00:44:07,590 --> 00:44:11,330
They, you know, the father says, you
know, we're carrying the light. Um,

598
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:15,890
we're the good guys. And the sun
sort of repeats that by the end.

599
00:44:15,891 --> 00:44:18,810
I won't tell you what happens
cause you should read it, but, um,

600
00:44:19,130 --> 00:44:23,420
there's this affirmation of that light,
but what the light is, who knows?

601
00:44:23,450 --> 00:44:26,210
There's sort of a
promethian narrative there.

602
00:44:26,211 --> 00:44:30,410
There's also a messianic narrative
there. Um, I think personally,

603
00:44:30,411 --> 00:44:35,130
my own reading of it is that it's
McCarthy meditating on the end of his own

604
00:44:35,730 --> 00:44:38,910
life. Mccarthy is a very old
man with a very young son,

605
00:44:39,330 --> 00:44:43,500
and I think he was thinking
about his own death. And, uh,

606
00:44:44,070 --> 00:44:48,530
the fate of the father in that novel
I think is very much about McCarthy,

607
00:44:48,531 --> 00:44:52,830
his sense of himself. So
yeah, McCarthy is a tough one.

608
00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:56,010
Um, in Marilyn Robinson,
I like a lot. Also,

609
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:00,830
I like the beauty of her prose. Um,
that Biblical cadence that Sheen,

610
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:04,530
Mccarthy both have. I really
like, I love the outdoor imagery,

611
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:06,120
the nature imagery of that novel.

612
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:11,960
And I love Roth for my own
obscure and perverse reasons.

613
00:45:12,390 --> 00:45:15,390
Um, yeah, so

614
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:21,150
I sort of have my favorites,
but I like them. I really,

615
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:24,000
there are things that I like
about all of them. You know,

616
00:45:24,001 --> 00:45:27,510
interesting story about liking novels.
I hated Salinger.

617
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:30,490
I really hated Salinger,
um,

618
00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:34,200
because I found him so
pretentious and effected.

619
00:45:34,470 --> 00:45:39,470
I just hated that tone of voice until
I was working on this book on religion.

620
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:44,880
And I read Franny and Zooey and here
you can tell most of my great thought

621
00:45:44,881 --> 00:45:45,810
happens in the middle of the night.

622
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:50,610
So I had been thinking about Franny
and Zooey and I suddenly woke up in the

623
00:45:50,610 --> 00:45:53,220
middle of the night thinking,
I know what style is for in the middle of,

624
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:57,120
in Franny. And Zooey so I got
up and I wrote it down. And um,

625
00:45:57,540 --> 00:46:01,980
that lecture that I gave on Franny and
Zooey is part of my new book. And when,

626
00:46:01,981 --> 00:46:05,880
when the book was reviewed,
uh, for presses, um,

627
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:10,050
a part of it, I, one of my
readers said it was the,

628
00:46:10,110 --> 00:46:13,230
it was the best reading he'd ever
seen of contemporary fiction.

629
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:19,160
And it made me love Franny and Zooey
because suddenly I had suddenly I had

630
00:46:20,340 --> 00:46:24,600
something to think about other than like,
this is so pretentious.

631
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:29,520
I had a reason why, uh, why that,
that tone in that style was there.

632
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:32,610
So you know, thinking about
books can really change your,

633
00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:37,440
your sense of whether you like
them or not. It is self, sir.

634
00:46:37,441 --> 00:46:42,060
I know in a self serving way
now who's pretentious? Um,

635
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:43,980
okay.
Other questions?

636
00:46:47,910 --> 00:46:48,743
Oh yes.

637
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:54,250
Conversation with their roommate yesterday
and we really like the bluest eye and

638
00:46:54,260 --> 00:46:57,670
there's one way we didn't read
the loved one the more I said,

639
00:46:58,220 --> 00:46:59,660
well maybe because a lot of them,
so Brian,

640
00:46:59,830 --> 00:47:02,930
a little bit American Asian
American literature. Yes.

641
00:47:05,110 --> 00:47:10,110
[inaudible] just kind of buckled his
academic snobbery to not to move below it.

642
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:13,100
You must read the last grade,
don't or not popular?

643
00:47:13,690 --> 00:47:15,250
Oh, no, not at all.

644
00:47:15,251 --> 00:47:20,251
I used to teach beloved and I stopped
because of that because we put it on the

645
00:47:20,291 --> 00:47:22,570
one 27 syllabus partly,

646
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:26,200
and that wasn't here when
I first started teaching.

647
00:47:26,201 --> 00:47:29,110
So the first time I offered this
lecture course, one 27 didn't,

648
00:47:30,490 --> 00:47:33,280
and then we put it in
place in the department.

649
00:47:33,820 --> 00:47:36,670
And because it was on that syllabus,
I held off.

650
00:47:36,910 --> 00:47:40,000
I still think beloved is an amazing novel.

651
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:43,270
I also have the length problem
in that part of the period.

652
00:47:43,530 --> 00:47:45,790
I'm sure you didn't notice that,
um,

653
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:48,820
that the novels are along and
that part of the syllabus,

654
00:47:49,330 --> 00:47:54,130
a beloved is another really huge
novel so that it's, it's a problem.

655
00:47:54,131 --> 00:47:59,131
So I decided instead of putting it on
there to rely on the fact that most people

656
00:47:59,501 --> 00:48:00,910
would either have read it in high school,

657
00:48:00,911 --> 00:48:05,140
or at least a majority would have
read it in high school or in one 27.

658
00:48:05,710 --> 00:48:10,540
And that I could count on that knowledge
at least in a contextual sense.

659
00:48:10,541 --> 00:48:13,630
But no, it has nothing to do with
academic snobbery. Now. I was,

660
00:48:13,631 --> 00:48:16,510
I used to get pissed off
because when it was on the, um,

661
00:48:17,050 --> 00:48:18,220
when it was on the syllabus,

662
00:48:18,221 --> 00:48:21,480
I would always get certain
evaluations would come in and say, oh,

663
00:48:21,490 --> 00:48:25,780
I don't know why we read beloved. It's
such a, it's so overrated. You know,

664
00:48:25,781 --> 00:48:29,500
that was the snobbery and I that made
me upset because I thought, well,

665
00:48:29,501 --> 00:48:32,440
that's just a failure of openness as a,
as a reader,

666
00:48:32,860 --> 00:48:37,510
not to think about why it was so powerful.
Even if you don't like it yourself,

667
00:48:38,230 --> 00:48:42,760
but your answer was right.
It's, it's simply because
it's taught a lot elsewhere.

668
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:46,450
And then those other
practical reasons of length.

669
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:48,513
What else?

670
00:48:54,580 --> 00:48:59,380
Oh, well, I'm sure.
Yeah. Um, so let's see.

671
00:48:59,381 --> 00:49:04,150
What else would I put on there? Um, well,

672
00:49:04,151 --> 00:49:07,720
let me think.
Louise Erdrich is interesting to me.

673
00:49:07,721 --> 00:49:11,620
There's a long novel of hers called,
um, the last report on the miracles.

674
00:49:11,621 --> 00:49:16,030
A little no horse, which I think is an
imaginative concede is really fascinating.

675
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:20,890
It's this, the premise of the novel
is that this young woman who, uh,

676
00:49:20,891 --> 00:49:25,140
is a, is a wonderfully
gifted pianist who, uh,

677
00:49:25,570 --> 00:49:27,790
goes,
I can't remember where she's heading.

678
00:49:27,791 --> 00:49:29,710
It's been now a long time
since I read the novel.

679
00:49:29,980 --> 00:49:34,980
She's traveling and she
gets washed away in a flood,

680
00:49:35,291 --> 00:49:37,540
a freak flood of a river.
This is out west.

681
00:49:38,140 --> 00:49:40,480
And when she finally surfaces,

682
00:49:40,481 --> 00:49:44,220
she crawls up on the bank and she finds,
uh,

683
00:49:44,380 --> 00:49:49,300
the body of a young priest
who is on his way to be, uh,

684
00:49:49,330 --> 00:49:54,310
the priest at a mission on a reservation,
on an Indian reservation, uh,

685
00:49:54,311 --> 00:49:56,080
I think in the,
in the Dakotas.

686
00:49:56,650 --> 00:50:01,650
So she cuts off her hair and she puts on
the priest's robes and she pretends to

687
00:50:03,191 --> 00:50:04,690
be that priest and she becomes,

688
00:50:04,691 --> 00:50:09,100
she crossed dresses and is the priest
at the reservation for her entire life.

689
00:50:09,790 --> 00:50:14,230
And I just think it's a fascinating
premise, uh, for a novel.

690
00:50:14,380 --> 00:50:19,330
And it's very well done in her
language is quite, um, quite wonderful.

691
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:24,190
I again, uh, I'm ambivalent about
it because I find the ending facile,

692
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:25,420
um,

693
00:50:25,420 --> 00:50:30,420
it finally resolves all the problems that
this situation produces in a way that

694
00:50:31,221 --> 00:50:35,390
I don't find a complex
enough or challenging enough.

695
00:50:35,391 --> 00:50:40,340
It's just too easy to let it make it
all come together the way she does. Um,

696
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:43,940
so that's one. Um, let me think.

697
00:50:45,180 --> 00:50:46,380
There are like many,

698
00:50:46,381 --> 00:50:50,190
many other novels I can perpetually
torn whether to put the road on. Yeah.

699
00:50:50,230 --> 00:50:54,030
We're blood meridian or
some other McCarthy novel.

700
00:50:54,060 --> 00:50:56,970
I've taught at least four different,
um,

701
00:50:57,690 --> 00:51:02,690
Roth novels spanning the
period from 1962 the present.

702
00:51:05,130 --> 00:51:09,420
Um, other writers now, I don't
know why I'm blanking now that I,

703
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:14,130
um, that I think about this. Um,

704
00:51:15,870 --> 00:51:20,550
hmm. Who else did I like to put
on there? Oh, Eggers I really,

705
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:23,730
now I fess up. I really would
have loved to do what is the,

706
00:51:23,731 --> 00:51:26,250
what as our last novel.
Um,

707
00:51:26,490 --> 00:51:31,080
I think Eggers now Edgar started out
immature in the same way that I think

708
00:51:31,620 --> 00:51:33,120
Jonathan Safran Foer is,

709
00:51:34,530 --> 00:51:37,990
but he grew up as a beautiful thing.
Um,

710
00:51:38,430 --> 00:51:42,900
so heartbreaking work of
staggering genius, has a lot
of that sort of, you know,

711
00:51:42,930 --> 00:51:47,310
kind of Cliche postmodern trickery in it.

712
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:51,000
Um,
but by the time it gets to what is the,

713
00:51:51,001 --> 00:51:54,750
what that novel is like nothing else,

714
00:51:55,080 --> 00:52:00,080
there is no equivalent of that novel to
my knowledge anywhere in our tradition.

715
00:52:01,030 --> 00:52:05,610
Uh, it's just an astonishing
inhabitation of another person's life.

716
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,550
But in real time, I mean, I, I had,

717
00:52:08,551 --> 00:52:13,380
I was able to have dinner with him and
some other people when he came as the

718
00:52:13,381 --> 00:52:18,000
slessinger writer a few years
ago, and I said, you know,

719
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:23,120
did you find it confining to give
yourself over in that creative way to this

720
00:52:24,751 --> 00:52:29,190
other person's story? He said, yeah, it
was terrible. I would want to, you know,

721
00:52:29,191 --> 00:52:31,410
I'd be writing the truck
went down the road,

722
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:35,880
he'd have to call Valentino and say,
um,

723
00:52:36,060 --> 00:52:36,780
Valentino,

724
00:52:36,780 --> 00:52:41,340
that truck was the road gravel
or was it paved and was it dusty?

725
00:52:41,610 --> 00:52:45,570
Was there stuff kicking up or,
or was it just flat? You know,

726
00:52:45,571 --> 00:52:47,150
it was just amazing.
The,

727
00:52:47,230 --> 00:52:52,230
the degree to which he put his writing
pen at the service of another person and

728
00:52:53,881 --> 00:52:55,890
their story.
It's really remarkable.

729
00:52:55,891 --> 00:53:00,090
So given that extremely confining set up,

730
00:53:00,660 --> 00:53:04,980
he makes that novel truly literary
in my mind. It has a real form.

731
00:53:05,430 --> 00:53:10,170
It has a very lively voice, um,
and it's extremely powerful,

732
00:53:10,171 --> 00:53:14,490
fall and effecting.
So that's something I would,

733
00:53:14,580 --> 00:53:18,780
I would love to have. But
again, it's a huge novel. This
is, the problem is so long.

734
00:53:19,270 --> 00:53:23,100
I, I think I just need two semesters.
I think that would be better. Yes.

735
00:53:25,950 --> 00:53:30,150
I haven't read it yet, but I have to
say the reviews that I hear about it.

736
00:53:30,151 --> 00:53:34,590
So what is it exceeding loud? Incredibly
close, exceedingly, incredibly,

737
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:38,130
extremely, uh, extremely loud
and incredibly close. Um,

738
00:53:39,690 --> 00:53:44,690
the structure of the plot makes me doubt
a little bit because it's just another

739
00:53:45,151 --> 00:53:45,750
hunt.

740
00:53:45,750 --> 00:53:50,750
So it's this nine year old boy who loses
his father on nine 11 and he finds in

741
00:53:51,991 --> 00:53:56,580
his father's affects a
key that's marked black,

742
00:53:56,730 --> 00:53:59,310
I think has a little label on it.

743
00:53:59,610 --> 00:54:04,320
And so he goes around New York City
finding everyone by the name of black that

744
00:54:04,321 --> 00:54:06,410
he can find.
Um,

745
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:10,530
so it has the structure that's so
similar to everything is illuminated.

746
00:54:10,531 --> 00:54:15,090
That hunt structured just made me
think, hmm. I wonder whether this is,

747
00:54:15,180 --> 00:54:16,000
I mean,

748
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:21,000
is this just a one trick writer that
he has this idea and this is what it's

749
00:54:23,071 --> 00:54:24,950
always going to be.
A,

750
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:28,620
that doesn't necessarily mean that
someone is not a great writer. You know,

751
00:54:28,770 --> 00:54:32,760
Roth has kind of a one trick
pony in this way too. Um,

752
00:54:33,150 --> 00:54:36,690
he has his own repetitions
from novel to novel.

753
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:40,830
Most writers I know do,
but that seemed a little too,

754
00:54:40,831 --> 00:54:45,080
it's a little too close for me, so I don't
know. I have to find time to read it.

755
00:54:48,300 --> 00:54:49,800
Dennis Johnson,
I did actually,

756
00:54:49,801 --> 00:54:52,890
I was very interested in having
Jesus son as the last novel to,

757
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:57,150
I'm going to write a review for the
overview on Denis Johnson's, um,

758
00:54:57,330 --> 00:54:59,730
work by the end of July.

759
00:54:59,731 --> 00:55:02,340
So by then I'll know what
I think about him too.

760
00:55:02,950 --> 00:55:03,783
Hmm.

761
00:55:04,540 --> 00:55:09,160
Other questions or shall I let you go?
Any other questions?

762
00:55:09,820 --> 00:55:12,520
Okay. So I will see you at
the exam and I think some,

763
00:55:12,670 --> 00:55:16,180
some sections are having review sessions.
So check with your TF.
