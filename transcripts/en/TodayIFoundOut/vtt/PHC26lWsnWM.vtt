00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:12.940
While it’s an incredibly convoluted system,
the entire television industry is still basically

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:15.139
controlled by Nielsen ratings.

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:20.170
To this day, they have an immense impact on
advertising dollars and the overall financial

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:23.390
health of the companies that own television
networks.

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:28.480
From which TV shows are produced to how local
news cover certain stories, the goal of everyone

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.829
involved in television is to get viewers,
which in theory, translates to ratings.

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:38.761
It was over eight decades when the ratings
system name bearer, Arthur Nielsen Sr., first

00:00:38.761 --> 00:00:42.850
made name for himself keeping track of what
Americans bought at drug stores.

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.969
Seven decades later, we are still using similar
methods to keep up to date on people’s television

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:48.969
watching habits.

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:52.649
Here’s the history of the Nielsen ratings
and the story of the man who still controls

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.860
television to this day from the grave.

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:02.120
Arthur Charles Nielsen was born on September
5, 1897 in Chicago to mathematician parents.

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:07.000
Attending the University of Wisconsin, he
graduated summa cum laude in 1918, captained

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.600
his school’s tennis team and met his soon-to-be
wife Gertrude with whom he would share his

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.200
life with for the next 60 years.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.340
After college, he spent a year studying electrical
engineering in the US Navy during World War.

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.899
Then, he returned home and put his new skills
to good use, getting a job as an electrical

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:24.750
engineer at the Isko Company.

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.649
But Nielsen always wanted to open his own
business.

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:32.279
It’s not totally clear why he chose field
research and manufacturing evaluation reports

00:01:32.279 --> 00:01:38.799
(perhaps because of his electrical engineering
background), but using $45,000 ($633,000 today)

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:44.899
he borrowed from college fraternity brothers,
Nielsen opened the A.C. Nielsen Company in

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:45.899
1923.

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.729
The company provided performance surveys of
industrial equipment and did relatively good

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:55.679
business initially (about $200,000 annually,
which is about $2.9 million today).

00:01:55.679 --> 00:02:01.350
But on October 29, 1929, the stock market
collapsed and the country entered the Great

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.369
Depression.

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.999
Not immune to these financial struggles, Nielsen
nearly went bankrupt twice and was on the

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:12.920
verge of shutting down in 1931 but, like all
good businessmen, he learned how to adapt.

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:18.180
Relaunching as the Nielsen Food and Drug Index,
he began tracking grocery and drugstore purchases

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.069
for brands trying to survive during the Depression.

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:25.409
At first he did this by interviewing customers,
but he soon realized this didn’t do an accurate

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:28.420
enough job of reflecting real retail sales.

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:33.900
So, Nielsen audited merchant ledgers and receipts
from a carefully sampling of stores and relayed

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.480
patterns to grocery and drug brands.

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.330
This allowed brands to use real sales to compare
themselves to competitors.

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.790
Quickly, Nielsen became the biggest market
research company in the country.

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.970
But he wasn’t satisfied.

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.640
In the spring of 1936, Nielsen attended a
meeting where the keynote speaker was MIT

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.930
professor Robert Elder, who had recently developed
the “Audimeter.”

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.409
First used in 1935, the “Audimeter” was
a small piece equipment attached to the tuning

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:06.120
shaft of a radio that used wavelengths, photographic
paper and magnetic tape to track what radio

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.890
station and at what time the listener tuned
in.

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:14.379
Nielsen was so impressed with this relatively
accurate way of tracking radio listening habits

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:19.180
that he immediately acquired everything – the
patent applications, the trademark and a warehouse

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:20.420
full of “Audimeters.”

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.989
He mechanically tweaked, and redesigned the
device, as well as renaming the system to

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:26.390
the “Nielsen Radio Index.”

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:31.680
In 1938, Nielsen used it for the first significant
radio market test in history.

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:37.430
Calling it the “Chicago pilot,” the machine
was placed on radios in 200 Chicago-area homes

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:41.580
encompassing radios in rural, urban, farm
and town homes.

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:46.100
It was a smashing success, so much so that
within only a few years, Nielsen had nearly

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:48.510
50 business subscribers to his service.

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:52.590
The information he was able to provide his
customers was surprisingly accurate and specific

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:57.349
for the time; every 15 minutes, using a percentage,
he was able tell them how many people were

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:00.240
tuning in when their advertisement or program
aired.

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:04.529
He called this the “share” of the market,
a term we still use today when talking about

00:04:04.529 --> 00:04:06.390
radio and television ratings.

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:10.560
While Nielsen wasn’t the only company providing
radio ratings research (Hooper and Crossley

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:15.950
were other significant contributors), his
was the most methodical and precise.

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:20.849
With his background in engineering, the relative
machine-like precision of the Audimeter exceeded

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:23.120
Hooper and Crossley’s audience surveying.

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.460
This disconnect also made Nielsen hard to
deal with at times; he often conducted exhausting

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:32.210
explanation seminars to potential clients
and took forever to complete business deals.

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:34.650
He also hated flying.

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:38.730
Despite traveling thousands of miles a year
for work, Nielsen refused to fly because,

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:43.190
according to his own calculated statistics,
airplane travel (at the time) had a higher

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:46.080
rate of fatalities than other means of travel.

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:51.330
By the late 1940s and in the early 1950s,
Nielsen had become the leading force in market

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:54.979
research, having bought out nearly every other
company.

00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:59.860
1500 Audimeters were installed across the
country, representing every possible scenario

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:06.099
– rural household with kids, urban with
no kids, small town with retirees, etc.

00:05:06.099 --> 00:05:11.500
The operation was becoming so large that Nielsen
was looking for a new way to process all the

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:12.500
results.

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:16.800
He found it in the UNIVAC I, one of the first
commercial computers.

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:24.830
Purchasing it for $100,000 ($894,000 today),
it was delivered to the company in 1955, marking

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:28.699
Nielsen as one of the earliest adopters of
this new technology.

00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:34.580
In 1948, Nielsen expanded into television
and immediately dominated the market.

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:39.789
After the “freeze of 1948” (when the FCC
put a freeze on granting new TV station licenses)

00:05:39.789 --> 00:05:45.440
was lifted in 1952, the number of stations
exploded and modern television – with different

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:51.470
programs, commercials, TV personalities – began
to take shapes thanks in large part to Nielsen’s

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:52.470
ratings.

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:56.110
Without them, companies wouldn’t have the
knowledge that directly informed the best

00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:00.680
time, the best programs and the best target
audience for their commercials, ad buys and

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:01.680
sponsored programs.

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:05.820
In 1957, Arthur Nielsen Senior retired, giving
the company over to his son, Arthur Nielsen

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:06.820
Junior.

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:10.050
In retirement, Senior devoted his time to
his true love – tennis.

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:14.759
A distinguished collegiate tennis player,
he actually won several United States Father-Son

00:06:14.759 --> 00:06:17.300
Doubles titles with Junior in the 1940s.

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:22.759
In 1968, he built a luxurious tennis facility
at the University of Wisconsin (where he also

00:06:22.759 --> 00:06:27.080
built a school for marketing research) that
remains to this day one of the best in the

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:28.080
country.

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:32.040
Arthur Nielsen was elected to the Tennis Hall
of Fame in 1971 for being a “passionate

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:34.099
philanthropist for tennis development.”

00:06:34.099 --> 00:06:37.900
Nielsen died in 1980, but his name continues
to live on.

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:42.790
Arthur Nielsen Junior not only continued his
father’s revolutionary research practices,

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:43.790
he modernized them.

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:48.610
He pushed for new technologies (it was said
that he was the one who asked for the computer),

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:52.439
expanding their market and diversifying the
business (for instance, Nielsen Clearing House

00:06:52.439 --> 00:06:55.990
coupons generated significant extra revenue
for the company).

00:06:55.990 --> 00:07:00.080
As the years passed, the Nielsen rating system
has become synonymous with how television

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:04.370
shows get judged, and while there is some
controversy today with things like how they

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:09.430
account for people streaming shows on digital
devices, their data is still the gold standard

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:12.030
for determining how a show is performing.

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:15.710
The higher the rating, the larger sample of
people are watching; the more eyeballs, the

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:17.360
more an advertiser’s ad buy.

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:21.310
If the rating is too low, the show gets cancelled
and is no more.

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:25.070
As Nielsen Sr. once told told Nielsen Jr.,
“If you can put a number on it, then you

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:25.819
know something.”
