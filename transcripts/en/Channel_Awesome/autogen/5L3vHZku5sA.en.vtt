no no it's a gala feel but the reason I
 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.120 align:start position:0%
no no it's a gala feel but the reason I
think<00:03:52.420><c> about</c><00:03:52.930><c> your</c><00:03:53.470><c> opinion</c><00:03:53.799><c> that's</c><00:03:53.920><c> what</c>

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:54.130 align:start position:0%
think about your opinion that's what
 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:55.229 align:start position:0%
think about your opinion that's what
else<00:03:54.549><c> there</c><00:03:55.090><c> is</c>

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:55.239 align:start position:0%
else there is
 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:57.780 align:start position:0%
else there is
yeah<00:03:55.690><c> I</c><00:03:55.720><c> mean</c><00:03:56.019><c> there</c><00:03:56.260><c> is</c><00:03:56.290><c> a</c><00:03:56.410><c> split</c><00:03:56.829><c> so</c><00:03:57.280><c> I</c><00:03:57.549><c> I</c>

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:57.790 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean there is a split so I I
 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:00.539 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean there is a split so I I
think<00:03:58.450><c> it</c><00:03:58.600><c> works</c><00:03:58.840><c> though</c><00:03:59.140><c> because</c><00:03:59.380><c> I</c><00:03:59.980><c> I</c><00:04:00.310><c> think</c>

00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:00.549 align:start position:0%
think it works though because I I think
 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:01.650 align:start position:0%
think it works though because I I think
they're<00:04:00.820><c> playing</c><00:04:01.060><c> that</c><00:04:01.120><c> we've</c><00:04:01.299><c> gotten</c><00:04:01.540><c> to</c><00:04:01.570><c> a</c>

00:20:34.370 --> 00:20:34.380 align:start position:0%
think it's you know so much of what Zuko
 

00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:37.700 align:start position:0%
