00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Welcome back.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
By now you have seen all kinds of models based on differential equations

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
and all kinds of tricks to solve them on the computer.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
If that was all there is to it,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
thousands of phD students would be jobless.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
In this final unit, we'll touch upon more advanced topics

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
such as modeling buildings and air and water.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
We'll explore why it's hard to predict the weather,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and we'll look into aspects of software engineering,

00:00:24.000 --> 09:59:59.000
that is, how to do computer simulations in a proficient way.
