00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:03.780
- We've already been introduced
to the Chi-squared statistic

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:05.120
in other videos.

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.230
Now we're going to use it
for a test for homogeneity.

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:11.510
And homogeneity or homogeneity,

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:14.730
in everyday language this
means how similar things are

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.500
and that's what we're
essentially going to test here.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.020
We're gonna look at two different groups

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:20.710
and see whether the
distributions of those groups

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:24.030
for a certain variable are similar or not.

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:26.370
And so the question I'm
going to think about,

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:29.210
or we're going to think about
together in this video is,

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:30.060
let's say

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.410
we were thinking about left-handed

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.920
versus right-handed people
and we're wondering,

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.090
do they have the same
preferences for subject domains?

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:38.560
Are they equally inclined

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.060
to science, technology,
engineering, math, humanities,

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:42.230
or neither.

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.860
And so we can set up our null
and alternative hypotheses.

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:47.720
Our null hypothesis is that

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.960
there is no difference in
the distribution between

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.670
left-handed and right-handed people

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.340
in terms of their preference
for subject domains.

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.170
So, no difference

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.740
in subject

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.250
subject preference

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.610
for left and right.

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:08.350
For left

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:13.350
and right-handed folks.

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.180
And then the alternative hypothesis.

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.660
Well, no, there is a difference.

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:22.283
So there is a difference.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.440
So how would we go about testing this?

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.810
Well, we've done hypothesis
testing many times

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.360
in many videos already.

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.680
But here, we're going to sample
from two different groups.

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.810
So let's say that this
is the population of

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.560
right-handed folks and
this is the population of

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.410
left-handed folks.

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:44.820
Let's say from that sample
of right-handed folks,

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.260
I take a sample of 60,

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.780
and then I do the same thing
for the left-handed folks.

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.570
And these don't even have
to be the sample sizes,

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:57.010
so the left-handed folks,
let's say I sample, 40 folks.

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:01.100
And here is the data
that I actually collect.

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.980
So for those 60 right-handed folks,

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:06.880
30 of them prefer the STEM subjects,

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.690
science, technology, engineering, math.

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.400
15 preferred humanities.

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.400
And 15 were indifferent,
they liked them equally.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.180
And then, for the 40 left-handed folks,

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.880
I got 10 preferring STEM,
25 preferring humanities,

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.830
and 5 viewed them equally.

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.330
And then you see the total
number of right-handed folks,

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:26.720
total number of left-handed folks,

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.080
and then you have the total
number from both groups

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.500
that preferred STEM, total
number from both groups

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.100
that preferred humanities,
total from both groups

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.090
that had no preference.

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.180
So let's just start thinking
about what the expected data

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.360
would be if we're assuming that
the null hypothesis is true,

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.270
that there's no difference in preference

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:46.190
between right and left-handed folks.

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.950
This is the right-handed column.

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.170
This is the left-handed column.

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.350
Well assuming that the
null hypothesis is true,

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:55.680
that there's no difference between

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.180
right and left-handed people
in terms of their preference,

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.350
our best estimate of what the
distribution of preference

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.930
would be in the population generally

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.950
would come from this total column.

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:08.860
Since we're assuming no difference,

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.430
we would assume that in either group,

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.400
40 out of every 100 would
prefer STEM or 40 percent.

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.510
40 percent would prefer humanities

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:20.020
and 20 percent would have no preference.

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:22.700
And so our expected
would be that 40 percent

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:26.010
of the 60 right-handed
folks would prefer STEM.

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.177
So what's 40 percent of 60?

00:03:28.177 --> 00:03:32.060
0.4 times 60 is 24.

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.050
And similarly, we would expect 40 percent

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:36.350
preferring humanities.

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:39.003
40 percent times 60 is 24 again.

00:03:40.646 --> 00:03:42.380
And then we would expect 20 percent

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:45.010
of the right-handed group
to have no preference.

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.600
So 20 percent of 60 is 12.

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.950
And these, once again, they add up to 60.

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:53.450
And then for the left-handed folks,

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:55.410
we would go through the same process.

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:59.350
We would expect that 40
percent of them prefer STEM,

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:02.920
40 percent of 40, that is 16.

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:07.640
On the humanities, again,
40 percent of 40 is 16.

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:11.080
And equal, 20 percent of 40 is 8.

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.210
And then, all of these add up to 40.

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:15.220
Once you calculate these expected values,

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.640
it's a good time to make sure
you're meeting your conditions

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.740
for conducting a Chi-squared test.

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:22.350
The first is the random condition.

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:25.120
And so, these need to
be truly random samples,

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.030
so hopefully, we met that condition.

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:29.560
The second is that the expected value

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.130
for any of these data points

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:33.350
have to be at least equal to five.

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:35.930
And so we have met that condition.

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:38.170
These are all at least equal to five.

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:41.100
And then the last condition
is the independence condition

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:43.610
that we are either
sampling with replacement

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:45.190
or if we're not sampling with replacement,

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:47.110
we have to feel good that our samples

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:49.300
are no more than 10
percent of the population.

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:52.570
So let's assume that
that is the case as well.

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:56.560
And now, we're ready to calculate
our Chi-squared statistic.

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:00.470
We would get our Chi-squared statistic

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:02.130
is going to be equal to

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:04.650
the difference between what we got

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:07.200
and the expected, squared.

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:12.200
So 30 minus 24, squared, divided by

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:14.730
the expected, divided by 24.

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:18.320
And we'll do it for all
six of these data points.

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:20.220
So then, I will go to the next one.

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:21.803
So then, this is going to be,

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:26.700
so plus and if I look
at this and this here,

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:31.360
I'm going to have 10 minus 16, squared

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:35.530
over expected 16.

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:39.380
And then, I'm going to have,
I'll look at that data point

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:42.110
and that expected and I will get

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:47.110
15 minus 24 squared
over expected, over 24.

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:49.800
I'm running out of colors.

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:52.580
And then we would look at
that, those two numbers

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:53.413
and we would say,

00:05:53.413 --> 00:05:58.400
plus 25 minus 16 squared,
divided by expected,

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:04.670
and then, we would get, we
would look at these two,

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:09.630
plus 15 minus 12 squared,

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:11.830
over expected, over 12.

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:14.040
And then, last but not least,

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:16.130
lemme find a color I haven't used.

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:19.100
We would look at that and
that and we would say,

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:22.780
plus five minus eight squared

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:25.070
over expected, over eight.

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:27.970
Now, once you get that value
for the Chi-squared statistic,

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:31.030
the next question is, what
are the degrees of freedom?

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:33.530
Now a simple rule of thumb
is to just look at your data

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:37.220
and think about the number of
rows and the number of columns

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:39.510
and we have three rows and two columns.

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:41.120
And so your degrees of
freedom are going to be

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:44.280
the number of rows minus
one, three minus one,

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:48.050
times the number of columns
minus one, two minus one.

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:50.540
And so this is going to
be equal to two times one

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:52.640
which is equal to two.

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:55.120
Now the reason why that
makes intuitive sense

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:56.370
is think about it,

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:58.520
if you knew two of these data points,

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:00.830
and if you knew all of the totals,

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:03.310
then you could figure out
the other data points.

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:04.500
If you knew these two data points,

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:05.333
you could figure out that.

00:07:05.333 --> 00:07:06.720
If you knew this data point
and you knew the total,

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:07.880
you could figure out that.

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:09.110
If you knew this data point

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:09.943
and you knew the total

00:07:09.943 --> 00:07:11.512
you could figure out that

00:07:11.512 --> 00:07:12.690
And if you figured out that and that,

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:14.620
then you could figure
out this right over here.

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:16.750
And so that's why this
rule of thumb works.

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:17.980
The number of rows minus one

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:19.890
times the number of columns minus one

00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:22.430
gives you your degrees of freedom.

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:24.850
Now, given this Chi-squared statistic

00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:26.680
that I haven't calculated but you could

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:28.510
type this into a calculator
and figure it out,

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:29.880
and this degrees of freedom,

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:32.530
we could then figure out the P value.

00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:34.510
We could figure out the probability

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:37.420
of getting a Chi-squared
statistic this extreme

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:38.880
or more extreme.

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:42.340
And if this is less than
our significance level

00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:44.290
which we should have set ahead of time,

00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:46.630
then we would reject the null hypothesis

00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:48.410
and it would suggest the alternative.

00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:50.980
If this is not less than
our significance level,

00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:55.203
then it does not allow us to
reject the null hypothesis.
