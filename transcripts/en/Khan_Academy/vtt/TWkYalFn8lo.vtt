00:00:00.182 --> 00:00:02.993
- [Instructor] Liz's math test
included a survey question

00:00:02.993 --> 00:00:06.621
asking how many hours students
spent studying for the test.

00:00:06.621 --> 00:00:09.508
The scatter plot below
shows the relationship

00:00:09.508 --> 00:00:12.238
between how many hours
students spent studying

00:00:12.238 --> 00:00:14.358
and their score on the test.

00:00:14.358 --> 00:00:17.821
A line was fit to the data
to model the relationship.

00:00:17.821 --> 00:00:19.344
They don't tell us how the line was fit,

00:00:19.344 --> 00:00:21.173
but this actually looks
like a pretty good fit

00:00:21.173 --> 00:00:22.842
if I just eyeball it.

00:00:22.842 --> 00:00:24.384
Which of these linear equations

00:00:24.384 --> 00:00:26.510
best describes the given model?

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:28.540
So this, you know, this
point right over here,

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:30.746
this shows that some student
at least self-reported

00:00:30.746 --> 00:00:32.849
they studied a little bit
more than half an hour,

00:00:32.849 --> 00:00:34.813
and they didn't actually
do that well on the test,

00:00:34.813 --> 00:00:37.663
looks like they scored a
43 or a 44 on the test.

00:00:37.663 --> 00:00:39.146
This right over here shows,

00:00:39.146 --> 00:00:40.778
or like this one over here is a student

00:00:40.778 --> 00:00:42.314
who says they studied two hours,

00:00:42.314 --> 00:00:46.874
and it looks like they scored
about a 64, 65 on the test.

00:00:46.874 --> 00:00:50.560
And this over here or
this over here looks like

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:52.554
a student who studied over four hours,

00:00:52.554 --> 00:00:53.497
or they reported that,

00:00:53.497 --> 00:00:56.714
and they got, looks like
a 95 or a 96 on the exam.

00:00:56.714 --> 00:00:58.722
And so then, and these are
all the different students,

00:00:58.722 --> 00:01:01.074
each of these points represents a student,

00:01:01.074 --> 00:01:02.605
and then they fit a line.

00:01:02.605 --> 00:01:04.439
And when they say which
of these linear equations

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.832
best describes the given
model, they're really saying

00:01:06.832 --> 00:01:10.544
which of these linear equations describes

00:01:10.544 --> 00:01:14.260
or is being plotted right
over here by this line

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.369
that's trying to fit to the,

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:18.862
that's trying to fit to the data.

00:01:18.862 --> 00:01:20.307
So essentially, we just want to figure out

00:01:20.307 --> 00:01:21.940
what is the equation of this line?

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:25.669
Well, it looks like the
y-intercept right over here is 20.

00:01:25.669 --> 00:01:27.681
And it looks like all
of these choices here

00:01:27.681 --> 00:01:30.437
have a y-intercept of 20, so
that doesn't help us much.

00:01:30.437 --> 00:01:32.198
But let's think about what the slope is.

00:01:32.198 --> 00:01:34.526
When we increase by one,

00:01:34.526 --> 00:01:38.166
when we increase along our x-axis by one,

00:01:38.166 --> 00:01:39.895
so change in x is one,

00:01:39.895 --> 00:01:41.517
what is our change in y?

00:01:41.517 --> 00:01:43.487
Our change in y looks like,

00:01:43.487 --> 00:01:45.261
let's see, we went from 20 to 40.

00:01:45.261 --> 00:01:47.700
It looks like we went up by 20.

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.386
So our change in y over
change in x for this model,

00:01:51.386 --> 00:01:53.929
for this line that's
trying to fit to the data,

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:55.441
is 20 over one.

00:01:55.441 --> 00:01:57.194
So this is going to be our slope.

00:01:57.194 --> 00:01:58.486
And if we look at all of these choices,

00:01:58.486 --> 00:02:01.497
only this one has a slope of 20.

00:02:01.497 --> 00:02:04.940
So it would be this
choice right over here.

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:06.580
Based on this equation,

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:08.792
estimate the score for a student

00:02:08.792 --> 00:02:11.375
that spent 3.8 hours studying.

00:02:11.375 --> 00:02:14.558
So we would go to 3.8,
which is right around,

00:02:14.558 --> 00:02:17.928
let's see, this would be, 3.8
would be right around here.

00:02:17.928 --> 00:02:19.788
So let's estimate that score.

00:02:19.788 --> 00:02:23.104
So if I go straight up, where
do we intersect our model?

00:02:23.104 --> 00:02:25.492
Where do we intersect our line?

00:02:25.492 --> 00:02:27.389
So it looks like they would
get a pretty high score.

00:02:27.389 --> 00:02:30.795
Let's see, if I were to take
it to the vertical axis,

00:02:30.795 --> 00:02:33.722
it looks like they would get about a 97.

00:02:33.722 --> 00:02:35.982
So I would write that my estimate is

00:02:35.982 --> 00:02:39.255
that they would get a
97 based on this model.

00:02:39.255 --> 00:02:40.637
And once again, this is only a model.

00:02:40.637 --> 00:02:43.665
It's not a guarantee that if
someone studies 3.8 hours,

00:02:43.665 --> 00:02:45.128
they're gonna get a 97,

00:02:45.128 --> 00:02:48.223
but it could give an
indication of what maybe,

00:02:48.223 --> 00:02:50.567
might be reasonable to expect,

00:02:50.567 --> 00:02:52.968
assuming that the time studying

00:02:52.968 --> 00:02:54.607
is the variable that matters.

00:02:54.607 --> 00:02:56.196
But you also have to be
careful with these models

00:02:56.196 --> 00:02:58.075
because it might imply if you kept going

00:02:58.075 --> 00:02:59.847
that if you get,

00:02:59.847 --> 00:03:01.310
if you study for nine hours,

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:02.774
you're gonna get a 200 on the exam,

00:03:02.774 --> 00:03:04.803
even though something
like that is impossible.

00:03:04.803 --> 00:03:07.665
So you always have to be careful
extrapolating with models,

00:03:07.665 --> 00:03:09.211
and take it with a grain of salt.

00:03:09.211 --> 00:03:12.033
This is just a model that's
trying to fit to this data.

00:03:12.033 --> 00:03:15.795
And you might be able to
use it to estimate things

00:03:15.795 --> 00:03:18.842
or to maybe set some
form of an expectation,

00:03:18.842 --> 00:03:21.870
but take it all with a grain of salt.
