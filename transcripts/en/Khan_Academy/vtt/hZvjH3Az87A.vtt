00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:01.920
Let's see if we
can use our example

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.130
to understand the three
types of income statements,

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.440
and hopefully understanding
those income statements

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.115
will also help us
understand this example.

00:00:10.115 --> 00:00:11.490
So I'm going to
start off-- we're

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:12.640
going to focus on month two.

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:14.014
And what I have
done is I've just

00:00:14.014 --> 00:00:17.100
rewritten some of this accrual
income statement down here.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.800
So it really looks
like a statement.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.990
So this right here is
the income statement

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:24.660
for month two on
an accrual basis.

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.550
In that month, we
said we had $400

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:30.260
of revenue, $200 of expense.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.990
400 minus 200 gives
us $200 of income.

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:36.950
An income statement
tells us what

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:38.861
happened over a period of time.

00:00:38.861 --> 00:00:41.360
What was the activity-- how
much revenue, how much expenses,

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.240
and other things.

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:43.920
This is just a
super simplified one

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.730
without taxes, without interest,
without other types of expenses

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.020
over here.

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.744
I also have drawn the balance
sheet at the end of month one

00:00:52.744 --> 00:00:54.660
and the balance sheet
at the end of month two.

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.200
Or you could also view
this balance sheet here

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.440
as the balance sheet at
the beginning of month two.

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.100
And the main thing to realize
is income statement tells you

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.320
what happens over a time
period, while balance sheets are

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.980
snapshots, or they're pictures
at a given moment-- snapshots.

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:14.210
So this tells us
essentially what did I have.

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.490
The assets are the things that
can give me future benefit,

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:18.590
so what do I have.

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:20.650
And the liabilities
are things that I

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:23.460
have to give future benefit
to, or things that I owe.

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:24.710
So this is what I have.

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.040
This is what I owe.

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.500
And then the equity is what
I really have to my name

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.190
if I net out the
liabilities from the assets.

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.100
So at the beginning
of month two--

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.520
which is the end
of month one-- I

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.200
had $100 of cash, no
accounts receivables.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.670
I didn't owe anyone anything.

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:41.670
I didn't owe them money.

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.390
I didn't owe them services.

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.370
So 100 minus 0 means I had $100.

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:49.760
That's kind of what the
owners of the company

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.980
can say they have of value at
the beginning of the month.

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:56.750
You fast forward-- now
at the end of month two--

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.720
I now owe the bank $100.

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.946
So I just put this as
negative $100 here.

00:02:00.946 --> 00:02:02.320
It normally wouldn't
be accounted

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.180
that way on an actual
company's balance sheet,

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.150
but this is simplified.

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.180
But I have an accounts
receivable of $400.

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:13.744
So my total assets now
are $300 of assets.

00:02:13.744 --> 00:02:15.160
And remember,
accounts receivables

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.110
are an asset because
someone owes me something.

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.630
Someone owes me
cash in the future.

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.610
I still have no liabilities.

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.020
So you take all of your assets,
minus all of your liabilities,

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:29.500
and now I have $300 in equity.

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.880
So you can see the
snapshot at the beginning

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.690
of the month, 100 in equity.

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.920
Snapshot at the end of
the month, 300 in equity.

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.490
And so to go from one
point to the other,

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:44.430
to go from 100 to 300, I must
have grown in equity by 200.

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.420
I must have gotten $200 worth
of value from someplace.

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.770
And that's what the income
statement describes.

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:52.390
It describes it right over here.

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.380
The change in equity,
sometimes it's

00:02:54.380 --> 00:03:00.290
the change in returned earnings
or just change in equity.

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.230
That is going to be
the $200 in net income

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.409
that the company got
over that time period.

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:08.200
Now, there's one thing
that you're probably

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.620
confused by right now.

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.990
It's like, well, how do
we reconcile everything

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.630
with the cash?

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.660
We know that over this
period we got $200 in income

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:16.785
on an accrual basis.

00:03:16.785 --> 00:03:18.160
But when you look
at the cash, we

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.250
went from $100 positive cash,
to negative $100 in cash.

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.500
It looks like we lost $200.

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.390
So how can we reconcile the
fact that we got $200 in income?

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:30.540
How can we reconcile
that with the fact

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.960
that we lost $200 in cash?

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:35.940
And that reconciliation
is going to be

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:37.550
done on the cash flow statement.

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:40.320
And I'll do that
in the next video.
