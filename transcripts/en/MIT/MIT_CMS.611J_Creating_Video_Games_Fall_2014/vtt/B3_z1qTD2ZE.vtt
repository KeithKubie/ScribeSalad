00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.090
PROFESSOR: So one of the
big mantras in any kind

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.920
of environment is testing.

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.040
You have to keep
testing your game,

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.590
because no plan meets first
contact with the user.

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:21.742
You have to be able to see
how real people are going

00:00:21.742 --> 00:00:23.200
to respond to the
stuff that you're

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.850
making as soon as
possible, because many

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:29.070
of your assumptions going into
a project are going to be wrong.

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.660
Now, we encourage students to
go out and test their games

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:39.130
with as many people as
possible outside of class.

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:41.260
This is crucial for the
development process.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.635
And there are a couple of
assignments where they actually

00:00:43.635 --> 00:00:46.870
have to show us the
results of that testing.

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.490
And it's pretty much as
simple as sitting somebody

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:53.550
in front of a computer with
the latest version of the game,

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.250
or maybe with the paper
version of the game,

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.910
giving them a couple
of instructions

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:59.340
just so that they
can get started,

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.590
and then stepping back,
watching, and taking notes.

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:05.269
Trying to provide as little
guidance as possible,

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:07.342
so that they can
actually see how

00:01:07.342 --> 00:01:09.050
a player who knows
nothing about the game

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:11.010
responds to it for
the first time.

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.060
However, sometimes it
can be difficult to get

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.300
a lot of testing done
outside of class.

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.330
And students may be a little
bit shy approaching strangers,

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.680
for instance, even
other MIT students.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.000
So what we do also
in class is we

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.420
get different teams to
play each other's games

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:30.620
and give the feedback.

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:32.870
The quality of that feedback's
a little bit different,

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:35.584
because everybody the a room at
that point is in the same boat.

00:01:35.584 --> 00:01:37.000
They are all making
games, and all

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.910
trying to give
feedback in the way

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:41.430
that a game developer
will give another game

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.340
developer, as opposed
to, say, a naive

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.790
player who just wants to have
a fun time playing this game.

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.080
We will also be giving
feedback as instructors.

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.230
We give them our experience,
both as developers

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:57.300
and this instructors.

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.320
And we can tell them,
that's a great idea,

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:00.903
but there's no way
you're going to get

00:02:00.903 --> 00:02:03.550
it done within the amount of
time left in this semester,

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:05.030
because we've seen it.

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.050
We've seen how these projects
tend to go during the class.

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.080
No one else in the class
has gone through this class

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.040
multiple times.

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:18.390
So this is basically a way to
get feedback about the game.

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:23.070
And we teach students
various methods

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:25.287
to get the
information they want,

00:02:25.287 --> 00:02:29.410
and to record it, such
as questionnaires,

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.700
for instance, different
observational techniques,

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.340
different ways to script the
process of getting a new user

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.500
to actually get started.

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.570
And most importantly,
the importance

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:43.332
of just doing this a lot.

00:02:43.332 --> 00:02:45.290
PROFESSOR: So there are
a lot of different ways

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.940
you can do project management.

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.590
The one that we teach and
we favor at in our course

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.690
is we look at agile project
management techniques.

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.020
Most specifically, we look
at the one called Scrum.

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:07.140
And by the nature of agile,
agile project management really

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.640
requires a team to
work with itself a lot

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.990
to understand how the
team works together

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:15.180
and to understand each
of their team members'

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.120
strengths and weaknesses.

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.050
This is exactly not what we
give our students a chance

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:23.870
to do in the course
of the course,

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:29.990
unfortunately, because they
are working on short projects.

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:32.570
Each project tends to have
slightly different goals.

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:36.110
And they're changing
teams frequently.

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:40.250
So what we do do is we give
them a set of agile tools.

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:44.540
We introduce them to the concept
of backlogs, project backlogs,

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:48.220
creating very short
vision statements

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.280
to describe what the
goal of their project

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.964
is, but not go into a
whole lot of detail.

00:03:53.964 --> 00:03:55.380
We have them make
project backlogs

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.780
that list all the features
they would like to have.

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.620
We have them take a look at how
they break that amount of work

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.617
down into how much can
we get done in a week?

00:04:04.617 --> 00:04:06.200
And realistically
trying to figure out

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:07.910
how much they can get done
in a week, at which point

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:09.340
they realize their
project backlog

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:10.980
is about nine weeks long.

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:12.430
And they can trim
down from there

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:16.680
before they get started on some
of the less important things.

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.430
But we show them the tools.

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:20.426
We walk them through
using the tools.

00:04:20.426 --> 00:04:21.800
And then we
encourage them to use

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:25.360
the tools that work best for
the group that they're with

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.350
and the project
they're working on.

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:29.730
So instead of saying,
this is how you do it.

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:30.840
Shunk.

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:34.620
We say, here are a set of tools.

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:35.840
Work with all of them.

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.290
Use the ones that work best.

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:41.330
And try to iterate not
just your project, but also

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:43.140
the way you are
managing your project

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:45.440
and the way you're working
together with each other.

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:48.600
Because that's the only way to
get to a better working team,

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.622
is to find out what works.

00:04:50.622 --> 00:04:52.580
Accept that some of your
techniques don't work.

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:54.580
And try something new,
try something better,

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:57.140
until you do find what works
with that particular group

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:58.401
of people.

00:04:58.401 --> 00:04:59.900
PROFESSOR: So we're
not only talking

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:03.920
about the tools and processes,
the hard skills when

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:06.020
it comes to project
management, but we're also

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:09.830
looking at iterating on their
soft skills, which often comes

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:13.940
down to just how do you talk
to another person respectfully?

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:15.900
We talk about team dynamics.

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:19.640
So teams tend to grow
in a particular way.

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:24.870
And often, there are shared
qualities that all teams have,

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:30.197
when it comes from forming
from when they're getting

00:05:30.197 --> 00:05:32.030
their first conflict,
and trying to get over

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:34.850
their first conflict, to when
they're actually performing

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:37.490
pretty efficiently,
and then when

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:39.990
they feel like they're just
really kicking butt and really

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:41.320
moving forward.

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:44.500
We try to help them get
through to that final stage.

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:46.482
At best, they usually
get to right to the point

00:05:46.482 --> 00:05:48.190
where they really
start performing along,

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:50.890
really start being efficient
in what they're doing.

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:53.950
But what we want to do is have
them see the whole process,

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:56.050
see how the stages
differ, and then,

00:05:56.050 --> 00:06:01.260
come up with ways and approaches
to then get themselves

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.670
through the process,
and being able to talk

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:08.880
to their other teammates about,
maybe, a problem happened.

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:11.110
Maybe somebody didn't
check in some code.

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:15.107
And it caused two days
of work to go away.

00:06:15.107 --> 00:06:17.440
There are better things to
do than just to rant and rail

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:18.469
at this other person.

00:06:18.469 --> 00:06:20.010
So what are the
other things they can

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:21.792
do to get through that problem?

00:06:21.792 --> 00:06:23.250
So we want them to
talk about that.

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:24.980
We want them to
think about that.

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:27.970
We talk about it a
little bit in class.

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:32.150
And we ask them to give us
what would they do again?

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:35.050
If they had do this again in the
future, what would they change?

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:36.341
What would they do differently?

00:06:36.341 --> 00:06:37.970
So we're asking them
to do that through

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:39.660
their individual write-ups.

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:41.510
We ask for a lot of
reflection on the class,

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:44.610
on not just the game design
process, the game development

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:47.250
process, but also this
project management process,

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:52.540
and the communication between
team members, as well.
