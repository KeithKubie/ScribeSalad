00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:25.080
fact on the first viewing I was a little
 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:26.329
fact on the first viewing I was a little
bit off and on with him as well he

00:05:26.329 --> 00:05:26.339
bit off and on with him as well he
 

00:05:26.339 --> 00:05:27.860

but as he went along with his way of

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:32.460
but as he went along with his way of
 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:34.249
but as he went along with his way of
speaking the way they did his audio I

00:05:34.249 --> 00:05:34.259
speaking the way they did his audio I
 

00:05:34.259 --> 00:05:36.079

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:40.740
easily be achieved with modern-day CGI
 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:42.379

but in the long run I am fine with it

00:05:42.379 --> 00:05:42.389
but in the long run I am fine with it
 

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:46.369

00:05:54.539 --> 00:05:56.570
making one guy a little bigger I mean it
doesn't really do anything really for

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:56.580

if your characters slightly bigger I

00:05:59.420 --> 00:05:59.430

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:03.740
guess you'd be more physically imposing
but in the long run what does that

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:03.750
but in the long run what does that
 

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:05.899
but in the long run what does that
really do for the film you still have to
