Speaker 1:          00:00          Um, the point that we keep getting away from them, I haven't had an opportunity to, um, and Stephanie knows this as well as I do. If you're gaining say four pounds a year of fat, or let's say between 20 and 40, you've put on 40 extra pounds. So now you're obese or a nice lean, healthy young guy in 20, like many of us were. And by the time you're 40, you've got 40 pounds of excess fat. That's the equivalent of putting in about the 10 calories that she had to storing about 10 calories a day into your fat tissue that you don't burn them metabolize. So you eat, say 2,700 calories a day, half carbs, you know, 35% fat, 15% protein and 10 calories that they get trapped in your fat tissue less than a bytes worth of food, less than a sips worth of beer.

Speaker 1:          00:55          So the question or actually trying to ask is our answer, and this is again, just my approach as a curious journalists too with a science background is how do we explain those 10 calories? Because when we talk about those obese woman with starving children, all those obese women were doing was storing 10 or 20 calories a day depending on how quickly they became obese and those populations that tends to happen quickly in their 20s. Um, so we're asking this question, how do we, if you've got a situation where we have to end up with 10 calories stuck in the fat cells every day, that's 20, 30, 40 billion fat cells. So it's divided up very small. And is the brain somehow regulating that? Or again, is there a dysregulation in the body involving, pick your hormones, pick your enzymes when the one, um, that somehow traps fat in the fat cells or prevents the fat from being used for fuel when it's released from the fat cells until if you think about it that way, like you let yourself go to seed today, Joe Rogan decides I'm done.

Speaker 1:          02:04          I'm going to do nothing but drink beer. And you might start drinking five beers a day and over the course of 10 years you get 20 pounds and it's all here. That 20 pounds over the course of 10 years, it's the only about 20 calories. You might've added 800 calories of beer to your diet and stored 20 calories as fat. How does that happen? And why does it go here and not elsewhere in his step and said, this is insulin dependent fat tissue. Um, so those are, that's when we're talking about this, like this question, could somebody get fat during a famine or can they stay fat during a famine? All they have to do is hold on to 10 calories a day extra. If they're only eating 1,210 gets stuck in their fat cells, 1,190 is excoriated are expended. It's not that hard to imagine. And there's nothing in the laws of that says it to what could be dysregulated about their fat cells, even during a relative fam and not a complete famine, but a relative family that might be, and again, an animal experiments of which there are probably hundreds by now, different animal models. You can disassociate obesity from hype, from eating too much in the animal. Can I pause you for a second? Yeah,

Speaker 2:          03:22          yeah. So essentially you're saying that even if someone is taking in, uh, uh, a good amount of calories at the, uh, the, uh, smart amount of calories, 2000 calories a day, if you're taking in these calories in the form of sugar, your body is going to take a certain percentage of them, even if you're getting enough food and stored as fat. Whereas if you were taking in just protein and vegetables and things along those lines of your body would not

Speaker 1:          03:51          do that well. So this is the gets to them mechanism question and the evidence question.

Speaker 2:          03:56          So what you're saying that, right, so you're saying that if two people are on the same diet, one of us on 2000 calories of chicken and fish and vegetables and the other one is on 2000 calories of milkshakes and no sugary drinks and pasta and bullshit, that that person is going to gain a certain amount of calories and just put them to fat.

Speaker 1:          04:19          Right? Regardless that's, yeah, that's the hype. Vivity this being a science at hypothesis can be tested. Yes. Stephan, thanks. It's been tested 80 times, Steph, at times. I think it's, they've done a bad job of testing it and we will both tend to reject the studies that we don't like and then we defined on light by whether or not they got the answer we think is great.

Speaker 2:          04:43          Your perspective that this is not the case, your perspective is that like as you were saying in this study with a closely monitored these people's diets and they added additional fat in a, an additional carbohydrates that they both gained the same additional amounts.

Speaker 1:          04:57          Yeah, that's right. I mean if cares is a shot, this is correct. You have to see different levels of fat gain. I mean, Gary's, the short term study that they did was how short term was it? Two and three weeks. That's very short. Yeah. It is very short term, but still Gary says that insulin is the thing that gets fat in fat cells and that, I mean you would see some kind of difference. It insulin made any difference. You should've seen some kind of effect, right? Some kind of difference in fat gain. I actually, um, I don't want to start taking out charts, but this gets intense when dynamics that was worked out so over, uh, um, I promised I wasn't going to say boy, Oh boy, oh boy on the show. But it's my thanks to my Brooklyn born mother. It's my program then.

Speaker 1:          05:44          Um, and they the same is true. A lot of these overfeeding experiments do the same thing. So when they talk about over feeding, they, they, they literally overfeed. So they kind of do a reasonable way of figuring out which reading is, Stephen said they measured, uh, they calculated how much energy they needed to stay in energy and balance. And again, right there, that's a problem because one of the hypotheses says that the energy balance is dependent on the macronutrient content of the food. So you're going to get a different, different level depending on what the macronutrient content is and then different level of, of what, what's necessary for energy balance. So the classic example is a study that's my not for profit funded, that's been very controversial where they

Speaker 1:          06:38          got their subjects. This is David Ludwig and Cara ambling and their their colleagues at that Harvard and Boston Children's hospital. And they did this study in Framingham and they, they basically got a subjects to lose a 10 or 12% of their body weight and then they randomize them to three different diets, have three different macronutrient composition. And they basically calculated their energy expenditure on the three different diets, which is kind of exactly what we're talking about because if you want to be an energy balance, who know, you feed people exactly what they're expanding. And in that study, which was published a year ago, and they saw different levels of energy expenditure depending on the carbohydrate content of the Diet. So the higher level of carbohydrates, this is trying to keep them in energy balance. The, the higher the carbohydrate, the lower the energy expenditure, the lower the carbohydrate, the higher the energy expenditure. So again, it's just whether or not they did this study, right? Who knows. Science is a compilation of a lot of studies and we're trying to, you know, address exactly this point, but

Speaker 1:          07:49          merely building that into the experiment. We know what their energy expenditure shouldn't be. And then the point is when you increase in part, again, part of the trick of doing science is to say, look, we have competing hypotheses, uh, multiple hypotheses and it's vitally important that you always keep the multiple hypotheses in mind when you're interpreting the study. So one hypothesis says it's how much they eat and another hypothesis says it's what they eat and that what they eat is, is moderated primarily through insulin. And when you do these experiments, like the experiment that, that uh, Steve, Steven is talking about, Stephan, um, no, I'm completely confused. Uh, if you overfeed them, you start out with a 50% carb diet. Now you overfeed them. If there's a threshold effect on insulin, which turns out there is, and you're just moving them. And when you look at insulin dynamics, when insulin is below a very low point, the fat cells will mobilize fat and the lean tissue, we'll burn it for own.

Speaker 1:          08:55          Above that point, you get pretty much flat. So if you start people who are eating 1500 calories from carbs and you add them, pump them up to 2,500 calories from carbs are still in the plateau side of the incident. You wouldn't necessarily expect to see any difference. The only way you expect to see a difference, and that's why it helps to really interrogate both hypotheses so that you know when you're doing the experiment, whether or not you're actually testing something, you one hypothesis, you want to set up the experiments that all hypothesis predicts. The two hypotheses predict something entirely different. This experiment with arguably the two hypotheses predict the same thing. You'll get fat gain because insulin is elevated regardless, and when insulin is elevated, you're going to get fat gain. The question comes back to it. This, again, always vital to keep this in mind.

Speaker 1:          09:46          We want to what could possibly cause at 10 or 20 calorie excess that causes fat storage. I have a friend who was four to 400 pounds when he was 18. It was a tall kid, about six foot five. Um, he was, uh, say 200 pounds over weight, 200 pounds overweight is roughly a hundred excess calories over 18 years stored in your fat cells. That's, you know, even if you assume that you have to consume 300 calories to have 100 excess stored in your fat cells, that's, you know, one to Coca Cola is a day that he was drinking or one half a quarterpounder a day that he was eating that is lean friends weren't in. The question would be, why can't he just stop doing that again, Stephanie would say, cause there's brain won't let him and I would say because his insulin is elevated, it doesn't matter whether he stops it or not, he's got into addressing underlying mechanisms. Okay. Okay.

Speaker 3:          10:46          Um, all right. So now again, it's easy to tell stories. It's not easy to tell stories that are supported by scientific evidence. Now, um, I want to bring people's attention to reference number 11 on my site. There have been 29 studies now that have measured differences in energy expenditure, metabolic or Kevin Hall study met analysis. Correct. There have been 29 studies to date that I've measured calorie expenditure, metabolic rate on diets differing in carbohydrate and fat content. And when you put all those studies together, when you are at least the first 28 together and you look at what the overall literature says, it makes almost no difference to metabolic rate whether people are eating carbohydrate or fat. And in fact this very small difference that it does make actually favors high carbohydrate diets so you get a slightly higher metabolic rate when the Diet is predominantly carbohydrate.

Speaker 3:          11:47          Now this study that Gary cited is the one study out of these 29 that has reported a larger effect in any others of carbohydrate restriction on energy expenditure. So this study reported in effect bigger than any of these other 28 and difference. We went on this. You're not done, please. Thank you. Um, and, and interestingly, if you actually look at the data and these data have been Rhea analyzed by a researcher named Kevin Hall. And if you look at the data, you find that some of the participants, some of the data that represents some of these participants are literally physically impossible. They break the first law of thermodynamics. This is the conservation of energy. Gary knows about this. He has a physics background and they literally don't add up. And when you start subtracting the earth, the clearly erroneous data from the pool of subjects, this big effect size starts to shrink and shrink and shrink and shrink until after you've gotten rid of all of it.

Speaker 3:          12:52          This study does no longer, no longer reports a higher energy expenditure on a very low carbohydrate diet. And it's consistent with the previous 28 studies that were done. So that's my perspective on that. But I want to go back to this. No, no dare you taught for a long time and I'm going to talk for as long as I want now. Um, I wanna I want to talk about human energy metabolism and this idea of the 10 extra calories a day. Gary, I, I really continue to get the feeling that you do not understand human energetics. Um, because that's not how it works. Now I'm just saying 10 calories stored in the fat tissue. 10 calories, 10 calories and say anything about how much you have to eat. I'm not done. Okay. No, but you're in top thing. We carry. Got To stop doing that dude.

Speaker 3:          13:38          Gary back thing like you think I'm an idiot. All right. Are you done now? Are you done? Can we be clear that we're talking about you done now? Can I just finish this? No, you can't do until I am done without Gary. You have time to respond. You can respond, write down notes on what you want to respond to and after he's done you can tell them, but we're going to get out [inaudible] course on this. The thing that's not the point. No. Is this line. Thank you. Okay. Now what you see, there's basically two things you need to pay attention to here in terms of energetics. One is the imbalance between intake and expenditure, and that is very small, so it only takes a little bit of extra calories to cause somebody to start gaining fat. However, as they gain fat, their bodies get bigger.

Speaker 3:          14:23          They're gaining fat and lean mass. People with obesity have more fat and more lean mass and their calorie needs go up and up and up and up. The larger their bodies get. And so even though the imbalance between energy and taking expenditure is small, their calorie needs end up being quite a bit higher. Can I pause for a second? Yeah, so you're saying that someone just gaining calories, eating additional calories, their body gains lean mass as well. That's because fat. How is the brain regulate that? I didn't say it. Regulated. Medical doctor, Garrick Guy. Hold on. So fascinating. Like how does the brain muscle muscle, they're gaining muscle tissue. Some of its muscles. Some of it's okay. It's just because they're carrying around this extra weight and so the extra calories and then on top of that carrying around the extra weight forces their body to grow larger.

Speaker 3:          15:14          Presumably, I'm, I'm actually not sure what the mechanism is, but it doesn't have anything to do with the brain. Coincidence. I don't know what causes it. That's what I'm saying, Gary. Okay. Now, um, so, so, but the point is by the time the person has obesity, they are consuming 20 to 35% more calories than they were when they were lean. So that's not just a one or two cokes a day that is allowing them to remain obese. They are consuming 20 to 35% more calories. That is what the most accurate studies are saying. And so it's not just 10 extra calories or maybe just one or two cokes. We're talking about a substantial amount of extra calories and it's not as a generalization because we don't know what I mean, what's the ratio of how much fat people get out, how much weight people are gaining.

Speaker 3:          16:06          Everybody gains a different amount of weight. Like you're saying, they're eating 20 to 30% more cowards. Like who is like how many people, how much are they gaining? Like people get fat, they get 20 pounds overweight. People get fat, they get a hundred pounds overweight. They made a very, that's right. Yeah, and that's why I give a range because what you see is that people who are overweight, so they're in the overweight range, you just have some extra fat. They eat about 10% extra calories. People who have a little bit of obesity eat about 20% extra calories. People who have, who are very have very, very great obesity eat more like 35% is it packs with the amount, I'm sorry, is it possible what he was saying that if you do consume 10 extra calories over long periods of time that will accumulate extra calories. You're accumulating hours, like 10 diamonds going into it is, so how much do you have to deposit?

Speaker 3:          16:57          Correct. It is correct that if every day you eat 10 calories more than what you need, then yes. Or get bodies or your body stores. Yeah. We'll say that. If your body is storing 10% 10 10 extra calories over top of what you need, but the thing is that as you get bigger, what you need goes up and up and up. Because you're carrying around more. Correct. And so it's 10% in text or cow, sorry, not percent. It's 10 extra calories on top of the elevated amount that you're already eating. So you end up with these big differences in calories take. So that's how, that's how it really works.
