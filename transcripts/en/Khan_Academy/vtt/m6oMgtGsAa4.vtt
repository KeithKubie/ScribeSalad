00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:04.770
Part D. Let p sub 4 of x
be the fourth degree Taylor

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.560
polynomial for f
about x equals 0.

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.940
Using information
from the graph of y

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:13.700
is equal to the absolute value
of the fifth derivative of f

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:17.750
of x, shown above-- and that's
the graph right over here,

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:19.870
I put it on the side
to save space-- show

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:22.530
that the absolute
value of the difference

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:25.370
between the polynomial--
the fourth degree polynomial

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:28.510
evaluated at 1/4 and the
function evaluated at 1/4

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:32.060
is less than one over 3,000.

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:35.430
So this is, it seems like quite
an interesting problem here.

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.676
So first, let's just think
about what they're asking.

00:00:37.676 --> 00:00:39.050
They're asking
for the difference

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.120
between the polynomial and
the function evaluated 1/4.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.780
In other words,
they're asking us

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.660
to-- they're asking us to
bound the error of the function

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.494
approximation at
x is equal to 1/4.

00:00:53.494 --> 00:00:54.910
So let me draw a
little graph here

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:56.743
just so we can visualize
it a little better.

00:00:56.743 --> 00:01:00.560
So if that's our y-axis and--
let me draw it like this.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:05.230
So this is our y-axis
and this is our x-axis.

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:07.440
And our function, let's
say our function looks

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:08.610
something like this.

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.310
Our polynomial is centered at 0.

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.320
Our fourth degree
polynomial is centered at 0.

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.140
And so it'll be equal
to the function at 0.

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.570
And then it'll become
probably a worse approximation

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.436
as we get further and
further away from 0.

00:01:23.436 --> 00:01:24.810
And what they're
saying is, let's

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.950
bound how bad of
an approximation

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.540
that is when x is equal to 1/4.

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:34.010
So if we say that this is x is
equal to 1/4 right over here,

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:38.030
they're saying, look, take the
value of the polynomial at 1/4,

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.192
subtract from that the value
of the function at 1/4,

00:01:41.192 --> 00:01:42.900
and then take the
absolute value and then

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.160
that'll essentially give us the
absolute value of the error.

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.420
Or that will give us the
absolute value of the remainder

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.120
or give us the distance between
the two functions there.

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:56.860
And they want us to
bound that distance.

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.330
Now, to do this problem
there is something

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:00.930
that you just kind
of have to know.

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.940
And I've proven it
in another series

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:04.960
of videos-- two videos
I think it took me--

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.210
in the Khan Academy
Calculus playlist.

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:11.120
If you do a search for bounded
or error or approximation

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.830
or Taylor, you should
probably find it.

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:20.130
And that there's a general idea
here which we've proved that

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.910
if you have some function-- so
I'm going to show the general--

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:28.650
so if you have some function
f of x and that you have some

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.230
polynomial approximation
of it of degree n---

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.230
some polynomial
approximation of degree n.

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.620
And let's say that this
polynomial approximation is

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:38.515
centered at a.

00:02:38.515 --> 00:02:41.320
In our particular case, a is 0.

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.670
So that you're centered at a.

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:48.170
So we could write-- we
could say this is about a.

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.010
It's an approximation
about x equals a.

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:53.850
We can bound the error.

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.834
So let me first define
this error function here.

00:02:56.834 --> 00:02:58.250
Sometimes it's
called a remainder.

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.710
So we could say, the error
function for the nth degree

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:05.520
polynomial about a-- the
n-th degree Taylor polynomial

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.750
approximation about a-- it
will be a function of x.

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.490
So for any other x that you
pick, what will this error be?

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:15.600
Is equal to the difference
between these two things.

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.070
You could say it's f of x minus
that or that minus f of x.

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:20.790
But let me just
write it this way.

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:27.060
This is equal to f of x minus
the polynomial approximation

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:27.896
of x.

00:03:27.896 --> 00:03:30.020
And if you want to take
the absolute value of this,

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:31.430
that's equal to
absolute value of that.

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:32.860
And if you're taking
absolute values,

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:34.110
then you can switch the order.

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:36.400
So this is the same thing
as the absolute value

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:41.870
of the polynomial approximation
at x minus f of x.

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:47.060
So the thing that you just need
to know is, we can bound this.

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.050
We can bound this if
we know some properties

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:52.740
about the n plus 1.

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:54.600
So this is the nth
degree approximation.

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:58.930
If we know some properties about
the n plus 1th derivative of f.

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:07.830
So if we know that
the n plus 1th is

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:15.060
the derivative of f is less
than or equal to some maximum

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:16.990
value-- and in particular,
the absolute value

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:19.570
of the n plus 1th
derivative of f--

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:22.470
is less than or equal to
some-- we could call this

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:29.200
some maximum value--
over the interval, over x

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:33.910
is in the interval
between a and some b,

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:35.530
where b is greater than a.

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:45.919
Then we can make the statement--
and this is, once again,

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:47.460
something that I
prove in that video.

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:49.376
I think I call it the
boundedness of the error

00:04:49.376 --> 00:04:51.020
remainder for Taylor
approximation.

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:52.260
Something like that.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:59.460
Then we know that the
error function at any given

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:04.180
x where x is greater than or--
let me say this in particular.

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:08.070
Is any given x that's part
of this interval-- where

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:10.110
x is part of this
interval between a

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:17.310
and b-- is going to be less
than or equal to M times

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:23.950
x minus a to the n plus
1th power over n plus 1.

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:25.450
So this is the thing
that you really

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:29.630
have to know ahead of time to
be able to do this problem.

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:32.610
It would be nearly impossible in
the time constraints of the AP

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:35.440
exam to prove this
from first principles.

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:36.990
I encourage you to
watch that video

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:39.370
so you can understand
how this proof happens

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:40.520
from first principles.

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:44.020
But going into the AP
exam, based on the facts

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:46.610
that this did show
up in the 2011 exam,

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:48.640
it's probably good to
know this property,

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:49.772
to know how to bound it.

00:05:49.772 --> 00:05:52.230
And this is clearly what they're
asking for because they're

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:56.400
giving us-- so we know
what the fourth-- we

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.180
know what p sub four is.

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:00.480
p sub 4 of x-- it's up
to the fourth degree

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:03.480
term of the polynomial
approximation of f about 0.

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:05.750
In part B, we got all the
way the sixth degree term.

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:07.930
So if you want to go just
to the fourth degree term,

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:09.840
this is what p sub 4 is.

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:16.720
So this is 1 plus x squared over
2 plus x to the fourth over 4.

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:18.180
So we know that.

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:24.080
And we want to bound this
thing right over here.

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:28.350
So if we can find an M-- so
this is the fourth degree

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:31.100
polynomial.

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:32.850
This is the fourth
degree error that we're

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:34.860
talking about in this case.

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:36.100
Let me write it this way.

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:38.096
This is the nth error
in the general case.

00:06:38.096 --> 00:06:39.970
But we want to bound
the fourth degree error.

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:42.490
So if we want bound the
fourth degree error--

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:47.794
so we can say the fourth
degree error-- at b.

00:06:47.794 --> 00:06:49.210
In this case, we're
going to say--

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:51.330
or at 1/4 I should say, not b.

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:52.670
I never mentioned a b before.

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:54.450
I mentioned the b
when I prove it.

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:56.990
The fourth degree
error at 1/4 is

00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:59.850
going to be less than or equal
to-- I did mention a b here

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:03.020
so if you take this
to be 1/4, and 1/4

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:05.550
is part of that interval
so you can apply it here.

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:08.720
So the fourth degree error,
I guess you could say,

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:13.620
at 1/4 is going to be less
than or equal to some M times

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:18.730
b-- I should say, 1/4 minus a.

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:22.430
a in our particular case
for this problem is a 0.

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:28.100
So 1/4 minus is just 0
to the n plus 1th power.

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:31.770
So this is 4-- this is the
fourth degree polynomial. n is

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:34.740
4 so the n plus 1 power
is the fifth power.

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:37.430
All of that over--
and sorry, this

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:39.510
was supposed to be n
plus 1-- all of that

00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:41.090
over n plus 1 factorial.

00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:44.737
So this is going to
be over 5 factorial.

00:07:44.737 --> 00:07:45.820
Don't want to confuse you.

00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:50.450
This was-- all of that is
over n plus 1 factorial.

00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:53.560
So all of this is
over 5 factorial.

00:07:53.560 --> 00:08:05.140
So we can make this statement
if we know that the fifth

00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:07.200
derivative-- the n
plus 1th derivative--

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:11.150
if we know that the fifth
derivative of f is less than

00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:14.750
or equal to some value M-- the
absolute value of the fifth

00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:17.720
derivative of f, I should say---
is less than or equal to some

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:29.810
value at M over the interval
x is between 0 and 1/4.

00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:32.419
Those are our a's and b's
in this particular case.

00:08:32.419 --> 00:08:34.169
So when you look at
the graph-- and that's

00:08:34.169 --> 00:08:35.252
exactly what they gave us.

00:08:35.252 --> 00:08:37.590
They gave us the graph
of the absolute value

00:08:37.590 --> 00:08:39.409
of the fifth derivative of x.

00:08:39.409 --> 00:08:42.270
And 1/4 is sitting
right over here.

00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:43.669
So this is 1/4.

00:08:43.669 --> 00:08:46.510
We don't know exactly
what we hit over here.

00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:50.070
This looks like it's roughly,
I don't know, 31 or 32.

00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:54.330
But we know it's
definitely less than 40

00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:57.200
over the interval
between 0 and 1/4.

00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:59.125
So we can pick M to be 40.

00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:06.950
We know that this is
less than or equal to 40

00:09:06.950 --> 00:09:08.280
over that interval.

00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:10.140
So we can make this statement.

00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:12.340
And so we know that this
thing right over here

00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:14.400
is going to be less
because this over here

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:16.080
is the same as this over here.

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:20.000
We know this is less than--
let me write it all out.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.421
This is-- and I know of people
who got fives on this example

00:09:23.421 --> 00:09:24.670
without being able to do this.

00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:26.920
So don't stress out if this
seems really bizarre too.

00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:28.970
This is really so
they can separate out

00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:31.110
who happened to
know this, really.

00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:38.930
So this we can say is
based on this property,

00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:43.850
we can say is less than
or equal to 40 times 1/4

00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:45.560
to the fifth power.

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:48.320
So this is 40 times
1/4 to the fifth power.

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:51.360
So I could just say divided
by 4 to the fifth power

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:53.400
times-- and then the
denominator over here--

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:54.250
we have 5 factorial.

00:09:54.250 --> 00:09:55.208
I'll just write it out.

00:09:55.208 --> 00:09:57.416
5 times 4 times 3 times 2.

00:09:57.416 --> 00:09:58.790
And we don't have
to write the 1.

00:09:58.790 --> 00:10:00.430
That doesn't change the value.

00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:02.140
And now we can simplify this.

00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:04.980
We can divide the numerator
and the denominator by 4.

00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:07.710
So this becomes 10,
that just becomes a 1.

00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:09.120
We can divide it by 5.

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:11.560
This becomes a 2,
that becomes a 1.

00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:13.180
We can divide by 1.

00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:15.840
That becomes a-- oh,
sorry, we can divide by 2.

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:18.090
That becomes a 1,
that becomes a 1.

00:10:18.090 --> 00:10:20.400
And you say that this
quantity over here

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:23.610
is going to be equal to 1.

00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:25.200
So let me write it.

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:30.130
So all of this stuff is less
than or equal to 1 over 4

00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:35.080
to the fifth times 3.

00:10:38.390 --> 00:10:40.680
That's all we have left
in the denominator.

00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:42.131
And so what is 4 to the fifth?

00:10:42.131 --> 00:10:43.130
You may or may not know.

00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:45.660
You can work it out by hand if
you like, but 4 to the fifth

00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:47.840
is the same thing as
2 to the 10th power

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:49.457
because 4 is 2 squared.

00:10:49.457 --> 00:10:52.040
2 to the 10th power, if you're
familiar with computer science,

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:52.900
is 1,024.

00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:54.660
But you can work
it out yourself.

00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:57.050
So this is going to
be-- this is less than

00:10:57.050 --> 00:11:05.770
or equal to 1,024 times 3.

00:11:05.770 --> 00:11:06.640
So what is that?

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:13.020
That is less than or
equal to 1 over 3.

00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:14.113
Oh, what is it?

00:11:14.113 --> 00:11:15.350
72?

00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:16.691
3,000.

00:11:16.691 --> 00:11:19.570
1 over 3,072.

00:11:19.570 --> 00:11:24.050
So this quantity right over
here is less than 1 over 3,072.

00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:24.930
We know.

00:11:24.930 --> 00:11:26.540
We know that for a fact.

00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:29.830
Well, if something is
less than 1 over 3,072,

00:11:29.830 --> 00:11:32.300
it's definitely going to
be less than 1 over 3,000.

00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:35.102
1 over 3,000 is a larger number.

00:11:35.102 --> 00:11:36.310
It has a smaller denominator.

00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:41.380
That's definitely less than
or equal to 1 over 3,000.

00:11:41.380 --> 00:11:43.500
And then we are done.

00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:46.400
We've proven that this is
less than 1 over 3,000.

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:51.860
We've proven that the error at
1/4 is less than 1 over 3,000.
