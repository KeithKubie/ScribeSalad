JANE COX: Theatrical
Design Studio

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:06.110
is a course that
mentors students

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:09.320
through designing a show
for the theater program

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.080
and working with a
professional creative team,

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.290
or a fellow student's, visiting
artist's creative team,

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:17.990
like in one of our theaters --
designing the paperwork,

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:20.437
drafting the light plot,
writing the light cues,

00:00:20.437 --> 00:00:22.520
and going through a creative
process with the rest

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:23.630
of the design team.

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.690
Several years ago, we were
trying to decide whether or not

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:28.400
we should go all LED.

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.850
And at the time, lighting
technology wasn't really ready,

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:33.800
but we just decided
that the University

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.839
should be at the forefront
of entertainment technology.

00:00:36.839 --> 00:00:39.380
ABIGAIL JEAN-BAPTISTE: To have
the state of the art equipment

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:40.100
is one thing.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.050
But then on top of
that, we have the people

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.480
who use it professionally
telling us how to use it.

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.420
It's exciting because
it makes professionals

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:48.590
want to work here.

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.890
They want to see this new
building and this new space

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.620
with the best equipment that
literally across the country

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:55.500
has to offer.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.170
So it really makes the Princeton
arts community stand out.

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.820
