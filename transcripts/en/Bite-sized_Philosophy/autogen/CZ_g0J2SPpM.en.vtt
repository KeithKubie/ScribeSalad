00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.540
people wish upon a star because they

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:02.550
people wish upon a star because they
 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.150
people wish upon a star because they
have some intuition that aiming above

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.160
have some intuition that aiming above
 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.820
have some intuition that aiming above
the mundane has the potential to

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830
the mundane has the potential to
 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.490
the mundane has the potential to
transform themselves they make a wish

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500
transform themselves they make a wish
 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.680
transform themselves they make a wish
well if you're going to make a wish you

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690
well if you're going to make a wish you
 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.920
well if you're going to make a wish you
should aim at something high and even

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930
should aim at something high and even
 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.050
should aim at something high and even
just aiming at that is more likely to

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060
just aiming at that is more likely to
 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.099
just aiming at that is more likely to
make the wish come true and this is not

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:24.109
make the wish come true and this is not
 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:27.019
make the wish come true and this is not
metaphor you know I have this program

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029
metaphor you know I have this program
 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.359
metaphor you know I have this program
which you guys are going to do called

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369
which you guys are going to do called
 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.460
which you guys are going to do called
the future authoring program it's one of

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470
the future authoring program it's one of
 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.560
the future authoring program it's one of
two assignments one is that you write an

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570
two assignments one is that you write an
 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.600
two assignments one is that you write an
autobiography that's the past authoring

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610
autobiography that's the past authoring
 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.880
autobiography that's the past authoring
the other is that you write a plan for

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890
the other is that you write a plan for
 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.319
the other is that you write a plan for
the future that's the future authoring I

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329
the future that's the future authoring I
 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:40.880
the future that's the future authoring I
would recommend that you get started on

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890
would recommend that you get started on
 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.160
would recommend that you get started on
those right now like not right now but

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170
those right now like not right now but
 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.709
those right now like not right now but
like really soon because they're harder

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719
like really soon because they're harder
 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.049
like really soon because they're harder
than you think and some of you are going

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059
than you think and some of you are going
 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.810
than you think and some of you are going
to write like 15,000 words you're going

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820
to write like 15,000 words you're going
 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.880
to write like 15,000 words you're going
to get sucked right in this happens all

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890
to get sucked right in this happens all
 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.110
to get sucked right in this happens all
the time you're going to get sucked

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120
the time you're going to get sucked
 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.840
the time you're going to get sucked
right into it and so you write an

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850
right into it and so you write an
 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.340
right into it and so you write an
autobiography because you need to know

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350
autobiography because you need to know
 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.279
autobiography because you need to know
where you are and who you are right now

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289
where you are and who you are right now
 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:02.930
where you are and who you are right now
because how the hell are you going to

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940
because how the hell are you going to
 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.700
because how the hell are you going to
plot a pathway to the future unless you

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710
plot a pathway to the future unless you
 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.950
plot a pathway to the future unless you
know where you are and then you need to

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960
know where you are and then you need to
 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.750
know where you are and then you need to
write about the future because you're

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760
write about the future because you're
 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:09.710
write about the future because you're
not going to hit something unless you

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720
not going to hit something unless you
 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.100
not going to hit something unless you
aim at it that's for sure

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110
aim at it that's for sure
 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.469
aim at it that's for sure
and lots of times people won't aim at

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479
and lots of times people won't aim at
 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:16.670
and lots of times people won't aim at
what they want because they're afraid

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680
what they want because they're afraid
 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.890
what they want because they're afraid
the reason they're afraid is because if

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900
the reason they're afraid is because if
 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.230
the reason they're afraid is because if
you specify what you want you specified

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240
you specify what you want you specified
 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.870
you specify what you want you specified
your conditions of failure you know when

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880
your conditions of failure you know when
 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.120
your conditions of failure you know when
you fail and it's better just to keep it

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130
you fail and it's better just to keep it
 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.649
you fail and it's better just to keep it
foggy it's like well I don't know if I'm

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659
foggy it's like well I don't know if I'm
 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.810
foggy it's like well I don't know if I'm
succeeding or failing but you know I

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820
succeeding or failing but you know I
 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.440
succeeding or failing but you know I
can't really tell well great except you

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450
can't really tell well great except you
 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.060
can't really tell well great except you
can't hit anything you don't aim at and

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070
can't hit anything you don't aim at and
 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.700
can't hit anything you don't aim at and
so the future authoring problem program

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710
so the future authoring problem program
 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.550
so the future authoring problem program
is like it's an attempt to have you

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560
is like it's an attempt to have you
 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.039
is like it's an attempt to have you
articulate your character and so it's

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049
articulate your character and so it's
 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.200
articulate your character and so it's
the past authoring program who are you

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210
the past authoring program who are you
 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.490
the past authoring program who are you
and you know the past authoring program

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500
and you know the past authoring program
 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.780
and you know the past authoring program
allows you to break your life into

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790
allows you to break your life into
 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.300
allows you to break your life into
epochs and then to write about the

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310
epochs and then to write about the
 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.460
epochs and then to write about the
emotional you know the things that you

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470
emotional you know the things that you
 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.389
emotional you know the things that you
regard as important important events

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399
regard as important important events
 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.580
regard as important important events
that have shaped who you are and you

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590
that have shaped who you are and you
 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:02.749
that have shaped who you are and you
know you may find that some of those

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759
know you may find that some of those
 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.160
know you may find that some of those
some of that writing makes you emotional

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170
some of that writing makes you emotional
 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.429
some of that writing makes you emotional
I would say if you have a memory that's

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439
I would say if you have a memory that's
 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.260
I would say if you have a memory that's
more than 18 months old roughly speaking

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270
more than 18 months old roughly speaking
 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.080
more than 18 months old roughly speaking
and when you bring it to mind it has an

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090
and when you bring it to mind it has an
 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.440
and when you bring it to mind it has an
emotional impact

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450
emotional impact
 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.270
emotional impact
see a negative emotional impact there

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280
see a negative emotional impact there
 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.220
see a negative emotional impact there
it's like part of your soul is stuck

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230
it's like part of your soul is stuck
 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:17.940
it's like part of your soul is stuck
back there

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950
back there
 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.210
back there
and I know that's a metaphorical way of

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220
and I know that's a metaphorical way of
 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:22.589
and I know that's a metaphorical way of
thinking about it but what I mean is

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:22.599
thinking about it but what I mean is
 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:25.860
thinking about it but what I mean is
that the reason that you still

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870
that the reason that you still
 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.449
that the reason that you still
experience the emotion is because you

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459
experience the emotion is because you
 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:30.240
experience the emotion is because you
have not solved the problem that that

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250
have not solved the problem that that
 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.080
have not solved the problem that that
situation faced you with it might be a

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090
situation faced you with it might be a
 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.000
situation faced you with it might be a
real problem like maybe you got tangled

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010
real problem like maybe you got tangled
 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:37.650
real problem like maybe you got tangled
up with someone who is really bad and

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660
up with someone who is really bad and
 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.089
up with someone who is really bad and
that's rough man because you've got to

00:02:39.089 --> 00:02:39.099
that's rough man because you've got to
 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:40.770
that's rough man because you've got to
come up with a theory of malevolence to

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780
come up with a theory of malevolence to
 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.059
come up with a theory of malevolence to
deal with something like that and that's

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:42.069
deal with something like that and that's
 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:42.750
deal with something like that and that's
no joke

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760
no joke
 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.440
no joke
but if it still produces emotion it

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450
but if it still produces emotion it
 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.000
but if it still produces emotion it
means you haven't solved the problem and

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010
means you haven't solved the problem and
 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.940
means you haven't solved the problem and
we and your your brain is still tagging

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950
we and your your brain is still tagging
 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:52.650
we and your your brain is still tagging
it as threat it's a part of your

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660
it as threat it's a part of your
 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.990
it as threat it's a part of your
territory that you did not master threat

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000
territory that you did not master threat
 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.330
territory that you did not master threat
threat threat threat threat and until

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340
threat threat threat threat and until

threat threat threat threat and until
you take it apart and articulation

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230
you take it apart and articulation
 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:00.900
you take it apart and articulation
really helps out writing really helps

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910
really helps out writing really helps
 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.569
really helps out writing really helps
out then you're not going to free

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:03.579
out then you're not going to free
 

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:06.089
out then you're not going to free
yourself from its grip and that what

00:03:06.089 --> 00:03:06.099
yourself from its grip and that what

might not be that Pleasant I mean this

is one of those situations where doing

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090
is one of those situations where doing
 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.630
is one of those situations where doing
it tends to produce a decrement in

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640
it tends to produce a decrement in
 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.870
it tends to produce a decrement in
people's mode in the short term but

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880
people's mode in the short term but
 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.580
people's mode in the short term but
quite radical improvements three to six

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590
quite radical improvements three to six
 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.530
quite radical improvements three to six
months down the road you know and it's

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540
months down the road you know and it's
 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.180
months down the road you know and it's
often the case that you unfortunately

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190
often the case that you unfortunately
 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:22.680
often the case that you unfortunately
have to do something you don't want to

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690
have to do something you don't want to
 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.539
have to do something you don't want to

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:00.430
and you really believe it's worthwhile
 

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:02.190
and you really believe it's worthwhile
and you've thought it through you know

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:02.200
and you've thought it through you know
 

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:04.080
and you've thought it through you know
so that you're not weak you're not weak

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:04.090
so that you're not weak you're not weak
 

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:06.150
so that you're not weak you're not weak
you've got your damn arguments mustered

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:06.160
you've got your damn arguments mustered
 

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:07.980
you've got your damn arguments mustered
then when you make progress even a

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:07.990
then when you make progress even a
 

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:09.240
then when you make progress even a
little bit you think hey that's all

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:09.250
little bit you think hey that's all
 

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:10.650
little bit you think hey that's all
right and you get a little kick

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:10.660
right and you get a little kick
 

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:13.140
right and you get a little kick
you know dopamine kick and that's what

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:13.150
you know dopamine kick and that's what
 

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:14.640
you know dopamine kick and that's what
you want is that's where your positive

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:14.650
you want is that's where your positive
 

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:16.680
you want is that's where your positive
emotion comes from you can use cocaine

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:16.690
emotion comes from you can use cocaine
 

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:19.800
emotion comes from you can use cocaine
if you want but but you know that tends

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:19.810
if you want but but you know that tends
 

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:23.550
if you want but but you know that tends
to have relatively detrimental medium to

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:23.560
to have relatively detrimental medium to
 

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:25.740
to have relatively detrimental medium to
long term consequences but it activates

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:25.750
long term consequences but it activates
 

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:27.840
long term consequences but it activates
the same system so you have to be aiming

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:27.850
the same system so you have to be aiming
 

00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:29.070
the same system so you have to be aiming
at something and you should be aiming at

00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:29.080
at something and you should be aiming at
 

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:32.750
at something and you should be aiming at
something that's realistic that you want

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:32.760
something that's realistic that you want
 

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:35.790
something that's realistic that you want
that you could get you know like not

00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:35.800
that you could get you know like not
 

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:38.130
that you could get you know like not
easily because if it's easy in some

00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:38.140
easily because if it's easy in some
 

00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:39.630
easily because if it's easy in some
sense you've already got it it's going

00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:39.640
sense you've already got it it's going
 

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:41.700
sense you've already got it it's going
to push you and that's part of the

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:41.710
to push you and that's part of the
 

00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:44.040
to push you and that's part of the
pleasure actually because there's two

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:44.050
pleasure actually because there's two
 

00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:45.300
pleasure actually because there's two
things that you want to do when you're

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:45.310
things that you want to do when you're
 

00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:46.860
things that you want to do when you're
pursuing something that's important and

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:46.870
pursuing something that's important and
 

00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:48.480
pursuing something that's important and
one of them is to get the thing that's

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:48.490
one of them is to get the thing that's
 

00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:50.220
one of them is to get the thing that's
important but the other is is to make

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:50.230
important but the other is is to make
 

00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:54.120
important but the other is is to make
yourself better at pursuing things right

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:54.130
yourself better at pursuing things right
 

00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:56.670
yourself better at pursuing things right
so so you can get both of those at the

00:07:56.670 --> 00:07:56.680
so so you can get both of those at the
 

00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:58.770
so so you can get both of those at the
same time you you you're aiming out

00:07:58.770 --> 00:07:58.780
same time you you you're aiming out
 

00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:00.090
same time you you you're aiming out
something and you're increasing your

00:08:00.090 --> 00:08:00.100
something and you're increasing your
 

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:02.100
something and you're increasing your
competence it's like that's a good deal

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:02.110
competence it's like that's a good deal
 

00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:04.250
competence it's like that's a good deal
that's a good deal and there's a lot of

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:04.260
that's a good deal and there's a lot of
 

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:06.810
that's a good deal and there's a lot of
intrinsic meaning to be felt in that

00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:06.820
intrinsic meaning to be felt in that
 

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:10.280
intrinsic meaning to be felt in that
then the second half of the program you

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:10.290
then the second half of the program you
 

00:08:10.290 --> 00:08:13.140
then the second half of the program you
you write out a plan for for how you're

00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:13.150
you write out a plan for for how you're
 

00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:14.190
you write out a plan for for how you're
going to do it and how you're going to

00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:14.200
going to do it and how you're going to
 

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:15.660
going to do it and how you're going to
keep yourself on track and you can write

00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:15.670
keep yourself on track and you can write
 

00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:17.250
keep yourself on track and you can write
about why it would be good for you if

00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:17.260
about why it would be good for you if
 

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:18.720
about why it would be good for you if
you did this and why it would be good

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:18.730
you did this and why it would be good
 

00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:20.400
you did this and why it would be good
for your family and what possible

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:20.410
for your family and what possible
 

00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:21.930
for your family and what possible
benefits it would have to the community

00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:21.940
benefits it would have to the community
 

00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:23.760
benefits it would have to the community
you know because you want to nail this

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:23.770
you know because you want to nail this
 

00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:25.980
you know because you want to nail this
thing down and then you want to figure

00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:25.990
thing down and then you want to figure
 

00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:27.960
thing down and then you want to figure
out what kind of obstacles are going to

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:27.970
out what kind of obstacles are going to
 

00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:29.490
out what kind of obstacles are going to
come up and how you might overcome them

00:08:29.490 --> 00:08:29.500
come up and how you might overcome them
 

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:30.870
come up and how you might overcome them
and how you might keep yourself on track

00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:30.880
and how you might keep yourself on track
 

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:33.960
and how you might keep yourself on track
and all of that and we know because

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:33.970
and all of that and we know because
 

00:08:33.970 --> 00:08:35.730
and all of that and we know because
we've actually done a lot of research on

00:08:35.730 --> 00:08:35.740
we've actually done a lot of research on
 

00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:38.790
we've actually done a lot of research on
this particular program that if

00:08:38.790 --> 00:08:38.800
this particular program that if
 

00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:41.219
this particular program that if
University students do this and this is

00:08:41.219 --> 00:08:41.229
University students do this and this is
 

00:08:41.229 --> 00:08:43.770
University students do this and this is
more true if they're not too well

00:08:43.770 --> 00:08:43.780
more true if they're not too well
 

00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:46.200
more true if they're not too well
oriented to begin with if university

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:46.210
oriented to begin with if university
 

00:08:46.210 --> 00:08:49.230
oriented to begin with if university
students do this they're about 25% less

00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:49.240
students do this they're about 25% less
 

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:51.390
students do this they're about 25% less
likely to drop out which is a lot and

00:08:51.390 --> 00:08:51.400
likely to drop out which is a lot and
 

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:53.310
likely to drop out which is a lot and
about their grade point average

00:08:53.310 --> 00:08:53.320
about their grade point average
 

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:53.970
about their grade point average
increases

00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:53.980
increases
 

00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:57.930
increases
about 20% so hooray for that you know

00:08:57.930 --> 00:08:57.940
about 20% so hooray for that you know
 

00:08:57.940 --> 00:09:00.120
about 20% so hooray for that you know
because you never know when you develop

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:00.130
because you never know when you develop
 

00:09:00.130 --> 00:09:01.170
because you never know when you develop
an intervention if it's going to work

00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:01.180
an intervention if it's going to work
 

00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:03.480
an intervention if it's going to work
there's also evidence but not from my

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:03.490
there's also evidence but not from my
 

00:09:03.490 --> 00:09:06.569
there's also evidence but not from my
lab that doing such things improves your

00:09:06.569 --> 00:09:06.579
lab that doing such things improves your
 

00:09:06.579 --> 00:09:08.579
lab that doing such things improves your
physical health and I think the reason

00:09:08.579 --> 00:09:08.589
physical health and I think the reason
 

00:09:08.589 --> 00:09:09.990
physical health and I think the reason
for that is is that you know when you go

00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:10.000
for that is is that you know when you go
 

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.910
for that is is that you know when you go
over your autobiography and you scour

00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:11.920
over your autobiography and you scour
 

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:13.800
over your autobiography and you scour
out those negative places that you're

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:13.810
out those negative places that you're
 

00:09:13.810 --> 00:09:15.600
out those negative places that you're
sort of dragging along with you it

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:15.610
sort of dragging along with you it
 

00:09:15.610 --> 00:09:18.480
sort of dragging along with you it
lowers your overall stress load because

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:18.490
lowers your overall stress load because
 

00:09:18.490 --> 00:09:19.889
lowers your overall stress load because
your brain is kind of I think it's

00:09:19.889 --> 00:09:19.899
your brain is kind of I think it's
 

00:09:19.899 --> 00:09:22.530
your brain is kind of I think it's
calculating how dangerous the world is

00:09:22.530 --> 00:09:22.540
calculating how dangerous the world is
 

00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:26.639
calculating how dangerous the world is
by attending to the ratio of successes

00:09:26.639 --> 00:09:26.649
by attending to the ratio of successes
 

00:09:26.649 --> 00:09:28.560
by attending to the ratio of successes
to failures that you've had in your life

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:28.570
to failures that you've had in your life
 

00:09:28.570 --> 00:09:31.019
to failures that you've had in your life
something like that and so you know if

00:09:31.019 --> 00:09:31.029
something like that and so you know if
 

00:09:31.029 --> 00:09:32.819
something like that and so you know if
there are holes in your map that you

00:09:32.819 --> 00:09:32.829
there are holes in your map that you
 

00:09:32.829 --> 00:09:34.560
there are holes in your map that you
could still fall through then your brain

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:34.570
could still fall through then your brain
 

00:09:34.570 --> 00:09:37.079
could still fall through then your brain
regards the territory still has a bit on

00:09:37.079 --> 00:09:37.089
regards the territory still has a bit on
 

00:09:37.089 --> 00:09:39.840
regards the territory still has a bit on
the dangerous side and then you more

00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:39.850
the dangerous side and then you more
 

00:09:39.850 --> 00:09:41.790
the dangerous side and then you more
prepared for emergency action and that's

00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:41.800
prepared for emergency action and that's
 

00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:44.040
prepared for emergency action and that's
hard on you so you want to go back there

00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:44.050
hard on you so you want to go back there
 

00:09:44.050 --> 00:09:48.689
hard on you so you want to go back there
and fix up those experiences to the

00:09:48.689 --> 00:09:48.699
and fix up those experiences to the
 

00:09:48.699 --> 00:09:51.420
and fix up those experiences to the
degree that you can't
