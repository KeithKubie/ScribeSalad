00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.750
As I just told you, tools are fundamental in

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:06.050
software engineering. And I will stress this concept over and

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:08.240
over, throughout the class. And today we're going to talk

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.310
about a tool that is especially important, which is integrated

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:15.060
development environments, or IDEs. And you're probably familiar with

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:18.060
IDEs. So IDEs are environments that give you support for

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.580
your development activities. For example, for writing code, editing code,

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:25.320
compiling code, and so on. And we will focus specifically

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.890
on one particular IDE, which is called Eclipse. And

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.450
what I'm showing here is the two splash screens for

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:35.350
two versions of eclipse, Helios and Kepler. Eclipse is an

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.200
open, extensible development environment that was initially created by IBM

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.510
and is now managed by the Eclipse Foundation. And of

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:43.840
course, there are many other great IDEs such as for

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.310
example, Microsoft Visual Studio or Netbeans. We will be using

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:50.830
Eclipse because it is open and because it is multi-platform,

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:52.390
which means that you can use Eclipse

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.140
no matter what operating system we're using.

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.030
So if we consider the most commonly used operating system, such as Mac

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.780
OS, Windows, Linux, Eclipse runs on any

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.769
of these environments. Therefore, no matter what

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.490
you're using, you'll be able to install

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.560
Eclipse, run Eclipse, and follow the class.
