00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:07.980
&gt;&gt;&gt; Ladies and gentlemen, would you now please
welcome Chrix Finne and Kenneth Lui.

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:17.009
&gt;&gt;Chris Finne: My name is Chris Finne. I am
a product manager on the AdMob team at Google,

00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:20.610
and I am here with my colleague, Kenneth.
&gt;&gt;Kenneth Lui: Hi, everybody. My name is Kenneth

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:25.800
Lui. I lead content recruitment for Android
and the Google Play Store. My job is to make

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.890
sure that there are great apps and games in
the store for users and also to make sure

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.130
that -- you know, help you guys be successful
by using the store.

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:38.390
&gt;&gt;Chrix Finne: And my job is to make the ads
on AdMob better.

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.110
We're here today to talk to you about monetizing
your Android apps. We're going to cover a

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.550
bunch of different monetization options for
you and try and actually present a framework

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:52.620
for how to think about monetizing your apps.
Let's get right into it.

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.440
I think that there really are three things
that any app developer or, really, any software

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.110
business, needs to think about when you're
trying to grow a business from the thing that

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:05.930
you've built. This has actually gone around
on the Internet a few times recently. And

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:12.580
it's a pretty good framework.
Number one is user engagement. It's really

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:17.780
the key things. This seems obvious, but it's
-- it's it; right? Like, if you don't build

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.740
an app that is useful and valuable to people
and that they keep coming back to, you've

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.920
got nothing.
So that's really the key thing for building

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.130
a business later on.
Number two is distribution. Right? Obviously,

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.930
you need to make sure that the right people
around the world know about your app, find

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:38.330
your app, and get -- can get their hands on
your app.

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:44.760
And then only at the end of the day, the third
pillar is to think about monetization. How

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.250
you're going to make money from this app that
you've built.

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.770
So if you're working on a mobile app or any
software startup, this is even maybe how I

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:55.610
would organize my team; right? Any activity
that you do should fall into one of these

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:00.869
three categories.
And, really, when you are trying to think

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.729
about monetization, which is what we're talking
about today, it doesn't work unless you have

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:11.169
strength in the other two categories as well.
So at Google I/O, we actually have three sessions

00:02:11.169 --> 00:02:16.459
that cover these different categories. We're
talking right now about monetization. Following

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:22.569
immediately in this room, at 4:00, our colleagues
Patrick and Kushagra are going to be talking

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:27.269
about promoting your app, how to find new
users and distribute your app.

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:31.930
And then on Friday, our colleagues Neil and
Nick at 11:30 are going to talk about how

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.379
you can measure and understand your user engagement
using Google Analytics, which is a fantastic

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:42.290
tool for doing that.
We also have a code lab tomorrow to get in-depth

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.299
with a lot of these things and learn with
our developer team and our engineers about

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:49.200
how to do a lot of these things we're going
to be talking about today. That's tomorrow

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.799
at 11:45.
So, cool.

00:02:52.799 --> 00:03:00.299
Let's talk a little bit about monetization.
We're still at the beginning of this evolution

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:04.599
of the mobile ecosystem. And I think most
of you probably know this. We saw a very similar

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:10.439
thing happen with the Web ten years ago.
Today, there's just an incredible number of

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:15.739
devices out there. I think the stat came out
in March that there are actually more people,

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:21.689
at least in the U.S., buying smartphones and
tablets than buying laptop and desktop computers

00:03:21.689 --> 00:03:28.329
today, which is just crazy. It's hard to understate
the impact that this is going to have on computing

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:32.150
and on society.
So what about apps?

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.749
A few years ago, if you had a great idea for
an app, it was pretty simple. You'd put your

00:03:36.749 --> 00:03:41.419
app up, and maybe you would charge 99 cents
for it or you throw some ads on it and hope

00:03:41.419 --> 00:03:47.069
for the best. But things have gotten a lot
more complicated. There are many ways to monetize

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:52.680
your app out there. You can sell it, you can
sell stuff within the app, you can do virtual

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.700
goods, you can do subscriptions, you can do
advertising.

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:00.479
So one of the things that we get asked a lot
is, what monetization method should I use?

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:06.989
So we've thought about this. And we want to
try and show you guys a nice little framework

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:11.609
for thinking about this.
So here's the framework. It's not all that

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:17.040
simple.
This flowchart is not meant to be a -- you

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:23.450
know, a playbook, but it's just an illustration
of how complex the world is out there.

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:28.120
And, really, the point we're trying to make
is that there's no one path to monetizing

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:34.590
your app. Different people use apps in very
different ways. Anybody that's looked closely

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:39.830
at a piece of software knows that people use
it for all sorts of different things. Like,

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:46.570
users are diverse. And so it's really up to
you guys to understand your users and understand,

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:52.270
therefore, what are the best ways to monetize
depending on what your users are doing.

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:56.110
And if there's one thing we really want you
to take away from this session, it is just

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:01.780
that, that there's no one single path to maximizing
the value you get from your app. But it's

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:05.850
really about understanding your users and
understanding the best ways to do that, given

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:08.830
what they're doing.
So let's take an example.

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:13.670
So let's say you have a group of users that
are, you know, excited about your app and,

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:20.940
you know, maybe they are, I don't know, pick
a demographic, 35 to 45-year-old females in

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:27.000
the Midwest. They want to actually pay for
the stuff in your app. Maybe you are producing

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:33.430
a game that has virtual goods that they want
to kind of pay for in an ongoing way. Great.

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:36.780
That means you can actually do that. You should
just do that. That's a pretty direct way of

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:40.250
monetizing your app.
But in other examples, looking somewhere else

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:43.930
on the flowchart, you may have another group
of users who are not actually willing to pay

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:49.060
anything. Maybe they're just sort of browsing
through your app. Maybe it's an RSS reader

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:53.000
or something. In that case, you should think
about a different business model, in this

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:59.870
case, advertising.
So at Google, we have sort of two major venues

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:04.000
in which you can monetize your app. One is
the Google Play Store, which Kenneth is going

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:09.500
to cover in-depth in a minute. And the other
is, of course, indirect monetization through

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:12.010
advertising.
So let's turn it over to Kenneth. And he's

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:15.140
going to talk about all the different ways
you can monetize using Google Play.

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:21.270
&gt;&gt;Kenneth Lui: Thank you, Chrix.
So in this section of the presentation, we're

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:27.370
going to mainly talk about three things. The
first one is about expanding the opportunities

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:31.650
for monetizing applications in the Google
Play Store.

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:36.920
The second one is to really describe the different
options that you have and give you a high-level

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:42.870
overview of how to use them. And then, finally,
we're going to dive into a couple of case

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:47.780
studies of successful developers. Some of
the developers have been really successful

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:53.150
in climbing some of our top charts, top paid,
top free. But, more importantly, since this

00:06:53.150 --> 00:07:00.080
is a monetization talk, the top grossing categories.
So we'll take a look at those and see what

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:09.030
are they doing right that we can learn from.
So you've all heard from Hugo this morning,

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:15.250
and then just now Chris, about the tremendous
momentum of the Android ecosystem.

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:20.210
So building any type of a business really
requires you to have a customer base. And

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:26.030
so the customer base for Android is really
growing very rapidly.

00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:30.280
You might have seen me juts looking at this
clock in front of me. You don't see it. But

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:36.420
I'm seeing this second counting down for the
time remaining for the session. And that number

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:42.730
from Hugo, 12 devices a second, keeps ticking
every time I see that clock runs.

00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:51.460
So in about the ten minutes that we started
this talk, there's about 7,000 new customers

00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:57.250
that could potentially be consuming your services.
So the ecosystem is working really, really

00:07:57.250 --> 00:08:04.020
well. Isn't that just amazing?
But having users alone is really not enough.

00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:08.900
What we need to make sure is that they really
have the necessary instruments to pay for

00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:16.430
your services. And, in other words, that means
providing different options of forms of payment

00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:22.710
or what we call FOPs, set up that they can
actually very easily pay for your services

00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:26.260
within the Google Play Store.
And also these different forms of payments

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:33.729
need to suit different user needs as well.
So in the Google Play Store, we've always

00:08:33.729 --> 00:08:40.529
given users the option to charge by credit
card or by debit card. But, of course, not

00:08:40.529 --> 00:08:44.970
everybody has a credit card. Many different
-- many different demographics, different

00:08:44.970 --> 00:08:49.370
locations of users, you know, they don't actually
have access to a credit card.

00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:55.560
So we have added direct carrier billing. And
since last year at Google I/O, we've added

00:08:55.560 --> 00:09:00.300
five new countries and ten new carriers to
direct carrier building.

00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:06.079
And as you've heard from Chris's talk just
earlier, direct carrier billing really has

00:09:06.079 --> 00:09:11.930
a very, very major impact on revenues and
sales. And I'm really glad to report that

00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:19.509
nearly 40% of Google Play users are actually
able to charge their purchases directly to

00:09:19.509 --> 00:09:26.829
their mobile bill. So this is huge.
What's new is Google Play Balance.

00:09:26.829 --> 00:09:33.880
So Google Play Balance introduces a new form
of payment via stored value. You're going

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:38.370
to be getting your new devices soon. So with
these new devices in hand, all of you will

00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:45.980
get a $25 credit automatically added to your
Google Wallet account to spend on Google Play

00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:50.559
content.
So as we were talking about earlier, not every

00:09:50.559 --> 00:09:56.370
user has access to a credit card. Not every
user or device has access to direct carrier

00:09:56.370 --> 00:10:00.930
billing, for example, if you have a Wi-Fi-only
device, you wouldn't have direct carrier billing.

00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:06.220
So as you can imagine, there are many new
opportunities that can be opened up with stored

00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:09.110
value.
This is still very much in the early stage,

00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:14.649
and we're actively working this area. So please
stay tuned for more news coming up in the

00:10:14.649 --> 00:10:20.230
near future.
Now, in addition to more users and setting

00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:26.209
out more forms of payment, we really need
to make sure that it's easier for users to

00:10:26.209 --> 00:10:32.110
consume your services and also provide you
as a business more flexibility to charge for

00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:35.920
your services.
So not so long ago, deciding on a business

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:43.379
model in the app space was actually relatively
straightforward. You would build in an application,

00:10:43.379 --> 00:10:47.720
and then when you're done, you kind of decide,
hey, do I want to launch it as a free application?

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:53.610
And maybe I have some advertising in it? Or
should I have it as a paid application? And

00:10:53.610 --> 00:10:57.829
that's the choices you have when you go to
the publisher, you know, console, is to pick

00:10:57.829 --> 00:11:00.790
free or paid.
It's a very simple model, but at the same

00:11:00.790 --> 00:11:06.940
time, it also has limitations, because it
didn't have some of the capabilities needed

00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:13.509
for today's business environment.
We now have many more options in Google Play

00:11:13.509 --> 00:11:19.189
to cater to those needs. But that also means,
very importantly, with those options, those

00:11:19.189 --> 00:11:24.009
added options, you really need to start thinking
about your monetization strategy not after

00:11:24.009 --> 00:11:28.850
development, but when you design the application
and as you're developing your application.

00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:32.110
You really kind of have to think of it as
a business of what the application is going

00:11:32.110 --> 00:11:37.019
to do, what the game is going to do, and build
in the monetization method within it.

00:11:37.019 --> 00:11:40.829
So without further ado, let's take a look
at what those options are, and we'll dive

00:11:40.829 --> 00:11:45.699
into a few examples.
So let's start with free.

00:11:45.699 --> 00:11:50.779
Free provides, as we all know, people -- users
like free. It gives you the lowest barrier

00:11:50.779 --> 00:11:54.589
to entry to at least -- for users to at least
try out your application.

00:11:54.589 --> 00:12:04.070
In terms of monetization, free typically means
ad-driven. Your app downloaded as free, but

00:12:04.070 --> 00:12:09.220
you could be earning indirect revenue through
advertising throughout the lifetime of the

00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:12.939
application.
There could be many reasons why you decide

00:12:12.939 --> 00:12:17.480
to go this way, to be ad-driven. It could
be because paid apps are not supported. Or

00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:23.399
it could be in certain countries or if your
content is simply more suitable for free,

00:12:23.399 --> 00:12:28.189
that's what you will decide to do.
Chrix is going to go into this area in-depth

00:12:28.189 --> 00:12:36.800
in the latter part of this presentation.
In premium, this is where the user pays per

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:42.430
title. So in Google Play, this is a one-time
charge. What that means, it's a one-time charge

00:12:42.430 --> 00:12:48.089
that associates your user account with the
title that you purchased. That means that

00:12:48.089 --> 00:12:54.190
if you paid for an application, even though
you may change your device or you may upgrade

00:12:54.190 --> 00:13:00.139
your system software or later, let's say,
if you add a tablet or add a new device and

00:13:00.139 --> 00:13:05.009
you log on with the same account, if you paid
for that premium title, you will have access

00:13:05.009 --> 00:13:10.279
to it, and you only need to pay for it once,
and you also get all subsequent updates to

00:13:10.279 --> 00:13:13.779
the application as well, without having to
pay again.

00:13:13.779 --> 00:13:18.279
Obviously, for updates, you can also launch,
you know, version 2, Version 3 as a separate

00:13:18.279 --> 00:13:24.450
title that you can charge again. But that,
you know, has its ramifications by itself,

00:13:24.450 --> 00:13:29.319
which is you're kind of splitting your install
base. But that's a different topic.

00:13:29.319 --> 00:13:33.379
So that's free and premium.
And then, finally, there's trial, where you

00:13:33.379 --> 00:13:39.389
typically have a light version, sometimes
limited by functionality, or maybe it's time-bound,

00:13:39.389 --> 00:13:46.540
whereby the user can upgrade to a full version
if they like what they see in the free version.

00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:52.060
This model is particularly popular in premium
games. We see a lot of premium games that

00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:58.360
have a light version and a full version. And,
in fact, as an anecdotal kind of example,

00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:03.930
when we feature something in the Google Play
Store, let's say we feature a paid title or

00:14:03.930 --> 00:14:09.511
premium title, we very often see a big jump
not just in that title, but also in the free

00:14:09.511 --> 00:14:14.389
version of that title as well. So users always
look at these things. Paid, sometimes they'll

00:14:14.389 --> 00:14:20.519
go to the free and if they like what they
see, they come back to pay for the paid version.

00:14:20.519 --> 00:14:27.579
Let's talk about freemium. Freemium is a very
popular topic today, and I'm sure a lot of

00:14:27.579 --> 00:14:33.920
you are hearing about it because of the success
that's getting. Freemium is largely possible

00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:41.769
because of in-app billing capabilities. The
user downloads the game or app for free, and

00:14:41.769 --> 00:14:44.959
further down the line in the application,
you have different in-app products that are

00:14:44.959 --> 00:14:50.920
offered to users, such as virtual currency,
special items, or digital content that you

00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:55.879
purchase within the app itself. This is a
great model, because it allows your users

00:14:55.879 --> 00:15:00.639
to download it without having to pay for it,
invest some time in learning how the game

00:15:00.639 --> 00:15:07.220
works or what the app does, and then have
further offerings for them to purchase. Obviously,

00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:13.139
some apps are better suited for freemium.
We've seen a lot of successes in social casual

00:15:13.139 --> 00:15:20.910
games. Some other applications may not suit
this form of payment very well. Or this type

00:15:20.910 --> 00:15:26.389
of payment very well, which is, for example,
like productivity or business. For example,

00:15:26.389 --> 00:15:30.660
imagine if you have a spreadsheet, and if
you charge 50 cents every time somebody wants

00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:35.490
to print something or format a paragraph,
that's not so cool.

00:15:35.490 --> 00:15:41.160
So some category of applications work; some
don't in the freemium case.

00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:47.189
So let's take a look at how in-app billing
works. I was giving you kind of a quick run-through

00:15:47.189 --> 00:15:53.430
of an example. This is based on the sample
code which is available on developer.android.com.

00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:58.600
We'll do a quick run-through.
So, first, Google Play client application

00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:05.620
which is on the device plays a very central
role in letting your application work with

00:16:05.620 --> 00:16:09.350
the Google Play server.
So your application actually never really

00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:12.569
has to talk to the server except through this
Google Play client.

00:16:12.569 --> 00:16:20.149
We have something which is called market billing
service within the client. And this is when

00:16:20.149 --> 00:16:25.050
you actually set up in purchases, you set
up your product catalogue through the publisher

00:16:25.050 --> 00:16:29.290
console. And you can set different currencies
and so forth by publishing them through the

00:16:29.290 --> 00:16:36.029
Google Play publisher console. And your application
would reference, right, as you -- as you build

00:16:36.029 --> 00:16:40.259
your application, your application will be
making -- exposing those products available

00:16:40.259 --> 00:16:44.120
for purchase within the application. And you
can build your application logic around it.

00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:49.179
Now, typically, this is how an application
would be set up. And, again, this is structured

00:16:49.179 --> 00:16:55.040
after the sample code that we have on developer.android.com.
But, typically, you would have a building

00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:59.739
service set up. The billing service makes
requests, sends billing requests to the market

00:16:59.739 --> 00:17:04.160
billing service. You have a billing receiver,
which receives asynchronous messages back

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:11.250
from the server. You also have maybe a couple
classes to response -- to respond to the messages

00:17:11.250 --> 00:17:15.050
that you receive through the response handler.
And then you may have a purchase op server

00:17:15.050 --> 00:17:23.730
so that when you confirm that something has
been transacted, you reflect it in the UI.

00:17:23.730 --> 00:17:29.000
And you may also have a security module within
the client itself to handle various different

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:33.540
security aspects.
And then optionally, you can also set up your

00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:38.860
own server to store your transaction status.
It's not something that's required, but it's

00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:43.510
something that's probably good to have. In
the cases where you delivered content, for

00:17:43.510 --> 00:17:48.330
example, it's good to have your own server
and also maybe do tracking of transactions

00:17:48.330 --> 00:17:53.150
and also security validations separately from
the application, which is probably from a

00:17:53.150 --> 00:18:00.450
best practice perspective better than storing
that security mechanism in the client.

00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:06.120
And lastly, there are two types of in-app
purchases, one which is managed; another which

00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:09.200
is unmanaged.
So managed is very similar to when you buy

00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:14.540
an application, where the Google Play Store
will actually keep track of those services

00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:19.500
-- of those items that have been purchased.
Unmerchandising is something which the Google

00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:25.370
Play Store will help you with the transaction
flow but let you manage after that in terms

00:18:25.370 --> 00:18:33.160
of who has rights to what and so forth.
So let's take a quick look at how a request

00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:37.410
is made for a purchase.
Before this actually happens, you actually

00:18:37.410 --> 00:18:42.200
make a call to the Google Play -- Again, this
is still on the client. You make a call to

00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:46.550
the Google Play client to see what type of
billing is supported and what version.

00:18:46.550 --> 00:18:51.490
After you do that, after you check that you
actually does -- that the client actually

00:18:51.490 --> 00:18:55.990
does support in-app billing, then you send
a billing request with something called a

00:18:55.990 --> 00:19:02.400
request purchase, and you get back a bundle
with response code, a purchase intent, and

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:07.270
a request ID. What the purchase intent is,
remember when we were talking about earlier

00:19:07.270 --> 00:19:11.490
that you -- your application provides the
application interface, but the Google Play

00:19:11.490 --> 00:19:16.170
Store client actually provides the transaction
interface. Okay? So this is where the purchase

00:19:16.170 --> 00:19:23.790
intent comes into play.
Next, you get that intent. You're at the application.

00:19:23.790 --> 00:19:28.330
The user now wants to purchase, let's say,
a sort. And now you start the intent. It goes

00:19:28.330 --> 00:19:35.059
into the Google Play interface. And here's
a quick code snippet of how this will work.

00:19:35.059 --> 00:19:41.071
The first section is setting up that request
purchase. You put in a product ID, and you

00:19:41.071 --> 00:19:47.060
also put in a product type. Product type would
be either it's an in-app or a subscription.

00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:49.620
We'll talk about subscription in a little
bit.

00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:55.550
Once you set up the request bundle, then you
basically send it to M SVS. M service is the

00:19:55.550 --> 00:20:00.940
market billing service. You trigger send billing
request, you send over that request, and you

00:20:00.940 --> 00:20:07.160
get back a -- a pending intent. The intent
where you launch the Google Play UI.

00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:19.160
Okay. And then, finally, your application
can pop that up, the screen, for purchasing.

00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:25.140
And when the transaction is completed -- and
"completed," it could mean it actually went

00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:32.150
through or the user somehow cancelled -- you
get a broadcast intent. So the broadcast intent

00:20:32.150 --> 00:20:37.930
is called in-app notify.
Once you get that, you as an application can

00:20:37.930 --> 00:20:42.680
now send another billing request to get the
purchase information, all right? So the server

00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:47.300
tells you, Google market -- Google Play tells
you, hey, the transaction is done. Now go

00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:51.550
get that purchase information. And you get
another broadcast intent, which is called

00:20:51.550 --> 00:20:56.300
purchase state change. And with it, you get
a JSON string, which contains things like

00:20:56.300 --> 00:21:02.010
the order ID, the product ID, purchase time.
And we'll talk about purchase token later

00:21:02.010 --> 00:21:07.200
on when we're in subscription. But, basically,
you get the information back from Google Play

00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:11.980
Store about that transaction.
Now, you also have to -- once you get that

00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:18.680
is to confirm those notifications. If you
don't confirm, the Google Play client -- Google

00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:23.000
Play server will continue to send you these
notifications, these broadcast intents, the

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:29.630
in-app notify. So once you've processed the
transaction and you say -- let's you made

00:21:29.630 --> 00:21:33.380
it available to the user, you want to make
sure that you respond to that notification

00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:38.520
so that the server knows that transaction
has been completed.

00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:43.930
All right. So that's kind of how -- how the
flow works.

00:21:43.930 --> 00:21:48.440
And let's switch gears a little bit. And we're
going to talk about a case study now that

00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:52.720
you know roughly how it works.
We're going to talk about a game called Tiny

00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:59.290
Village which is by a company called TinyCo.
This is an interesting case study, because

00:21:59.290 --> 00:22:04.940
this game was launched back in -- a few months
ago, back in December. It's a free to play

00:22:04.940 --> 00:22:11.280
game with in-app purchases. It's gotten 4.5
stars from users. So it's pretty popular,

00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:15.430
users are pretty happy about it. It's gotten
more than 3 million downloads. But in that

00:22:15.430 --> 00:22:22.500
short period of time, I think what's really
interesting is that Tiny Village is now number

00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:26.810
eight overall in top grossing in those few
short months.

00:22:26.810 --> 00:22:32.940
In the casual game category, it's number one
in top grossing, and number nine in top three.

00:22:32.940 --> 00:22:37.940
And you've also heard earlier that they have
experienced really good RPRU (phonetic) per

00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:44.310
paying user as well.
So the game goes like this. Just a quick overview

00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:50.130
of what the game does so we can go through
the other examples, is that you're building

00:22:50.130 --> 00:22:57.500
a village, and you have different types of
currencies. You can raise dinos, dinosaurs,

00:22:57.500 --> 00:23:04.060
you can build your stores, you can build houses,
you can ask your employees or the villagers

00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:08.860
to go work. They will pay you taxes. They
will give you currencies. You have special

00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:13.590
items that you can collect. You see the -- the
Android there, the Android statue there.

00:23:13.590 --> 00:23:18.590
But the point of the game is, you can actually
run through this game play, you know, with

00:23:18.590 --> 00:23:23.850
the option to either pay or not pay. If you
look at the top, we have some coins there.

00:23:23.850 --> 00:23:30.080
The coins are where you collect from taxes
or, you know, from the dinosaurs. And you

00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:34.490
can use them to build new things.
And the crystals on the left, those blue crystals

00:23:34.490 --> 00:23:39.490
a lot of times are used to accelerate the
game play. So rather than spending 2,000 coins,

00:23:39.490 --> 00:23:45.320
you can spend 50 crystals. And those 50 crystals
are something that you can purchase in packs.

00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:51.550
So that's the basic premise of the game.
So why is it successful, we asked.

00:23:51.550 --> 00:23:57.250
So some of the strategies that we talked about
and that they focused on were how you engage

00:23:57.250 --> 00:24:00.490
users.
So we'll take a look at how TinyCo has managed

00:24:00.490 --> 00:24:07.470
to engage users through the 50 levels of this
game. How do you convert users to paying users.

00:24:07.470 --> 00:24:12.910
Right? How do you get over the free -- the
free users and get them to actually pay for

00:24:12.910 --> 00:24:16.720
in-app items?
And once they start paying, how do you monetize

00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:20.540
them more?
And then, finally, how do we manage user retention

00:24:20.540 --> 00:24:25.840
so people -- the users are interested to continue
to come back.

00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:31.130
So here's this chart regarding, you know,
engagement. A lot of times engagement is measured

00:24:31.130 --> 00:24:36.790
by active users. So on the Y axis, this is
where see DAUs, which is daily active users.

00:24:36.790 --> 00:24:41.470
And it's very typical to see a game where
the daily active users as the game progresses

00:24:41.470 --> 00:24:45.890
-- you know, on the X axis, this is where
the levels of the game, the 50 levels are.

00:24:45.890 --> 00:24:50.420
As the level progresses, you have less daily
active users.

00:24:50.420 --> 00:24:59.340
Now, what is interesting was that you see
this hump between levels 28 and 34.

00:24:59.340 --> 00:25:03.650
What they found out was, you know, as this
trend goes down, if you actually target those

00:25:03.650 --> 00:25:09.030
users with specific exclusive features, you
can really effect the engagement of those

00:25:09.030 --> 00:25:13.540
users very, very effectively.
As you can see, the interpreted is going down

00:25:13.540 --> 00:25:18.970
but they actually did something that with
these exclusive features to bump up the daily

00:25:18.970 --> 00:25:21.790
active users. So there are a lot of things
that you can do and we will look into some

00:25:21.790 --> 00:25:27.120
of those.
Now, regarding pricing in terms to convert

00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:34.540
users, what they also did was look at various
different items that has a low-priced version,

00:25:34.540 --> 00:25:41.570
mid-priced version and high-priced version
with differences in those items. If you look

00:25:41.570 --> 00:25:48.590
at the folks, the users who bought those versions.
For the low-priced versions, there were more

00:25:48.590 --> 00:25:53.340
new users, newly converted users. They are
more attracted to the low priced items versus

00:25:53.340 --> 00:25:59.970
existing users. You see a pretty good progression,
where when you go to the high-priced version,

00:25:59.970 --> 00:26:06.060
more of the existing users buy it rather than
the newly-converted users.

00:26:06.060 --> 00:26:11.950
So as a continuation of that, what they discovered
is higher level users, high level players

00:26:11.950 --> 00:26:18.121
really spend on items that have higher returns.
So for example, you may be buying 99 cent

00:26:18.121 --> 00:26:24.830
crystals in the beginning, I'm going to try
this out. As you mature to the later level

00:26:24.830 --> 00:26:32.690
of the game, you see people buying larger
amounts maybe with a discount, maybe with

00:26:32.690 --> 00:26:39.610
larger returns. They also ran a limited mini
game with premium features which resulted

00:26:39.610 --> 00:26:44.350
in much higher returns and happier players.
And here's some of the stats. When they ran

00:26:44.350 --> 00:26:51.870
this campaign with this mini game, number
of paying customers went up 40%. Average user

00:26:51.870 --> 00:26:58.770
spent went over by about 30%. Most importantly,
revenues almost doubled. So here are some

00:26:58.770 --> 00:27:05.270
of the things that you can actually do to
affect picking wisely about who your players

00:27:05.270 --> 00:27:15.780
are, consumers are and targeting them appropriately.
So about user retention. Some of the things

00:27:15.780 --> 00:27:20.760
that are really important is launching content
frequently. In this particular type of game,

00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:26.810
it is to be able to attract the users. They
get distracted, they are attracted to come

00:27:26.810 --> 00:27:32.290
back and see what's new. So as you can see
here, there are things like, hey, you know,

00:27:32.290 --> 00:27:36.930
you have been playing with the game for a
while, how about building a village road trip?

00:27:36.930 --> 00:27:40.600
And then after a while, once you start building
their village road trip, how about building

00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:48.190
a statue so that you're tourists are going
to come and see this golden statue. Very many

00:27:48.190 --> 00:27:53.150
interesting things that you can launch frequently
to kind of track where the user is and attract

00:27:53.150 --> 00:27:59.380
them to come back.
Secondly, it's about timely and relevant incentives.

00:27:59.380 --> 00:28:06.240
So actually I was playing this game myself
and as I was running out of room on my village,

00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:12.410
the next time I launched a game, it told me,
hey, there's an expansion sale, 40% off, because

00:28:12.410 --> 00:28:16.560
I was actually running out of room. Now, if
that happened when I just started the game

00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:21.830
when I had acres of land or when I had lots
of land, that wouldn't make sense at all.

00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:27.740
So timing with the relevant content is very
important. And then finally, expanding beyond

00:28:27.740 --> 00:28:34.330
the game itself, having social engagement.
As you can see here introducing Betsy, introducing

00:28:34.330 --> 00:28:40.491
to the TinyCo community where you actually
invite and see other people's villages. Not

00:28:40.491 --> 00:28:46.370
just building a network, but building that
into a game play. So on the right there is

00:28:46.370 --> 00:28:53.070
Hotel Prehistoria, you can look at other people's
villages but put them into your own hotel

00:28:53.070 --> 00:29:00.100
as well. That also includes things like notifications,
right, so if it notices that you haven't been

00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:04.270
engaged with the game for a while, it would
gently nudge you through notifications to

00:29:04.270 --> 00:29:07.600
tell you, hey, here are some incentives to
come back into the game.

00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:16.500
The key point is to not just blindly put these
incentives out or launch or content updates,

00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:23.230
but it's really to iterate very quickly. Launch
these campaigns, find out if they are successful.

00:29:23.230 --> 00:29:26.850
Iterate it, and if something is successful,
can you continue and run it. But if it's not,

00:29:26.850 --> 00:29:31.510
then do something else. This is something
that they have done really well which is continuous

00:29:31.510 --> 00:29:39.820
iteration and really tracking the metrics.
What's also interesting was that, as we were

00:29:39.820 --> 00:29:47.550
conversing about why this game is so popular,
was really about optimizing the user experience.

00:29:47.550 --> 00:29:52.360
There are many different types of devices
out there in the Android ecosystem. There

00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:57.320
are low-powered devices, high-powered devices,
small screens, large screens. What's really

00:29:57.320 --> 00:30:02.260
important and what's really interesting is
that you need to cater to each and all of

00:30:02.260 --> 00:30:09.910
those users and not just have one single game.
So TinyCo has built a game engine called the

00:30:09.910 --> 00:30:16.600
Griffen engine. The Griffen allows you to
optimize the UI for different screen sizes,

00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:23.480
difference devices and different aspect ratios.
If the screen is wider, it works just as well.

00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:28.090
Smaller or have high density, it works just
as well. Also, looking at the power of the

00:30:28.090 --> 00:30:33.641
device, adapt to different frame rates. So
there are lot of animation that goes on. So

00:30:33.641 --> 00:30:38.070
depending on the power of the device, make
sure it is not laggy to any of those. So catering

00:30:38.070 --> 00:30:42.750
to specific users. And also provide native
performance as well.

00:30:42.750 --> 00:30:50.230
So, again, this is a really good example,
and I would encourage you to go talk to TinyCo.

00:30:50.230 --> 00:30:55.390
They will be at the sandbox. Andrew is here
-- I don't know if he is here, but a quick

00:30:55.390 --> 00:31:03.670
shout-out to share a lot of this information.
Feel free to jump up and ask him questions.

00:31:03.670 --> 00:31:09.809
Next let's talk about the paymium model and
the trial paymium model. Paymium model is

00:31:09.809 --> 00:31:16.720
really just a paper title. It's a combination
of premium plus in-app purchase. You have

00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:21.030
a title that sells and then have additional
items that you sell afterwards within the

00:31:21.030 --> 00:31:27.030
game or within the app. Trial paymium is a
variation of that, free initially, you pay

00:31:27.030 --> 00:31:33.660
to get the premium, upgrade to paymium and
then additional items after that. They are

00:31:33.660 --> 00:31:39.180
not actually many examples. But here's a very
good one which is Draw Something, I'm sure

00:31:39.180 --> 00:31:45.311
a lot of you are familiar with by Zinga. Draw
Something, there are two versions. The free

00:31:45.311 --> 00:31:50.810
version has in-app purchase items which is
ad driven. There's also a paid version, $2.99

00:31:50.810 --> 00:31:55.981
normally with an in-app item and that version
removes the ads within the application. The

00:31:55.981 --> 00:32:02.090
reason why we picked Draw Something is, again,
it's a very, very successful title. It's number

00:32:02.090 --> 00:32:09.390
one top paid overall and number seven top
grossing overall in the store. The brain and

00:32:09.390 --> 00:32:14.390
puzzle, number one top paid, number five top
free, and also occupies the number one and

00:32:14.390 --> 00:32:19.559
number three in top grossing with the paymium
version doing a little bit better on the number

00:32:19.559 --> 00:32:27.600
one slot there. So here's an example. Again,
this is probably more rare than the common

00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:32.080
case, is that they actually have two separate
APKs, two separate titles, published in this

00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:39.290
store and so their title is exposed in two
different lists. Because of the popularity

00:32:39.290 --> 00:32:45.780
of the game, they actually are in two lists.
Both the top paid and top free. Having to

00:32:45.780 --> 00:32:51.820
APKs allows to you do something interesting
with an opportunity to upgrade your free users

00:32:51.820 --> 00:32:56.650
to your paid users. So if you look at some
of these install charts, this was a flash

00:32:56.650 --> 00:33:01.220
sale which was run recently, just a couple
of weeks ago, and what happened was on the

00:33:01.220 --> 00:33:05.350
left it's a free version, on the right is
a paid version. When he they did a flash sale

00:33:05.350 --> 00:33:13.150
on the paid version, they actually let the
free users know there's a flash sale and see

00:33:13.150 --> 00:33:17.840
what happened to the paid version. So there
are some advantages to actually having multiple

00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:26.290
items of your game both as a paymium medium
and as a freemium model.

00:33:26.290 --> 00:33:33.710
Next talk into subscription which we launched
at the end of May. What subscription is an

00:33:33.710 --> 00:33:41.210
extension of in-app billing. It's an automatic
recurring monthly or yearly method of payment.

00:33:41.210 --> 00:33:46.760
It continues until it's canceled. Everything
is managed within the Google Play store. The

00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:51.740
user can go in with a normal interface. Now
you see a subscription tab there and you can

00:33:51.740 --> 00:33:56.510
actually see, you can uninstall the application
where you get a notification or you can unsubscribe

00:33:56.510 --> 00:34:05.770
and cancel your subscription. So as a tension
to what we saw earlier, to the in-app billing,

00:34:05.770 --> 00:34:11.360
it's -- we introduced a term which is a thing
called purchase token which associates subscription

00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:19.300
ID with user ID. And the subscription continues
to renew itself until a new purchase state

00:34:19.300 --> 00:34:27.369
is changed. And that can be a user pressing
-- you know, going into unsubscribing or canceling.

00:34:27.369 --> 00:34:32.440
And these could be delivered and communicated
via in-app notifications and also via a server

00:34:32.440 --> 00:34:37.530
API, so you can keep track of those subscriptions
yourself via your own server as well.

00:34:37.530 --> 00:34:43.950
Okay, so we talked about a lot of these options.
You are probably wondering, which one should

00:34:43.950 --> 00:34:49.350
you choose, there are so many of these. Now,
I'm going to show you a quick slide before

00:34:49.350 --> 00:34:56.929
we wrap up here is if we look at the top-grossing
lists in the play store. So I took a snapshot

00:34:56.929 --> 00:35:04.690
a few days ago. And you see out of the top
20 grossing, 20 of those top grossing in casual

00:35:04.690 --> 00:35:16.450
games, they were all freemium. On the left
side, this is applications, none of them,

00:35:16.450 --> 00:35:21.270
if you look at these types of applications,
the ones that are successful by looking at

00:35:21.270 --> 00:35:26.560
the top grossing list, you can see that it
depends on which application. All right, this

00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:32.190
is how consumers are responding to different
business models. Is that, yes, there are things

00:35:32.190 --> 00:35:41.290
like casual games, carts and casino, social,
focusing on the freemium. So it depends on

00:35:41.290 --> 00:35:47.740
what your application is. So key take-aways.
Number one, find the model and pricing that

00:35:47.740 --> 00:35:52.119
suits you. Take a look at these titles that
are successful, what their price range is

00:35:52.119 --> 00:35:57.220
to be competitive and what your offering is.
Number two, find the best ways to engage users

00:35:57.220 --> 00:36:04.490
through frequent updates and promotions, timely
incentives, launch relevant targeted content.

00:36:04.490 --> 00:36:10.140
Convert those users to paying customers. And
test often. I can't stress enough, test often,

00:36:10.140 --> 00:36:16.110
gauge success, iterate, and repeat. Optimize
user experience across devices. Integrate

00:36:16.110 --> 00:36:23.231
with social and do cross promotions. And really
most importantly as a part of this talk is

00:36:23.231 --> 00:36:26.390
to build monetization strategy into your app
development efforts.

00:36:26.390 --> 00:36:31.400
All right, so with that I will pass it back
to Chrix to talk about advertising.

00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:41.820
&gt;&gt;Chrix Finne: Cool, Kenneth, thank you. There's
a lot here, right. I don't know if I could

00:36:41.820 --> 00:36:46.590
even pair it back all those eight different
things Kenneth just asked me to do. That's

00:36:46.590 --> 00:36:52.030
sort of, I think, highlights the need for
any individual app developer to have a deep

00:36:52.030 --> 00:36:57.920
understanding of what their users are doing,
what the right model is for them. In advertising

00:36:57.920 --> 00:37:03.460
is many different things that we are going
to talk about that. I thought it might be

00:37:03.460 --> 00:37:07.950
useful to actually just talk for a little
bit about where the ad dollars come from.

00:37:07.950 --> 00:37:13.950
It's not just sort of an magic money box.
Let's go back and talk about how advertising

00:37:13.950 --> 00:37:21.220
was born. I like to watch Mad Men. I don't
know if you guys do. It's a show on AMC, and

00:37:21.220 --> 00:37:29.200
it's about advertising, right? Advertising
came about when mass media came about really.

00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:35.080
The first mass media was the newspaper. And
what happened is that businesses who had things

00:37:35.080 --> 00:37:41.110
to sell and wanted to reach customers and
distribute their product realized that there

00:37:41.110 --> 00:37:44.930
were people reading newspapers all around
the country and around the world and that

00:37:44.930 --> 00:37:49.490
they could actually find new customers by
promoting those businesses, right? So this

00:37:49.490 --> 00:37:55.780
is how advertising was born. The old joke
is that newspapers aren't actually selling

00:37:55.780 --> 00:38:01.980
news to their readers but they are just selling
the readers to the advertisers, in a sense.

00:38:01.980 --> 00:38:06.590
But of course over time as new forms of mass
media have developed, advertising has gone

00:38:06.590 --> 00:38:13.760
with that. So in the last 50 years we have
seen television, Internet, and now mobile.

00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:21.190
On Mad Men the protagonist is this guy name
Don Draper who is this cool cat who creates

00:38:21.190 --> 00:38:26.970
ads. He creates these compelling and engaging
ads which compel people to go buy a Kodak

00:38:26.970 --> 00:38:33.360
slide projector or go smoke Lucky Strikes
cigarettes. And I think that if Don Draper

00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:40.191
were alive today, he would be building mobile
apps. This is really just the beginning. Advertisers

00:38:40.191 --> 00:38:45.280
are only starting to create cool experiences.
You may have seen cool ad experiences on tablets

00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:51.050
that I see you all using today and stuff like
that. But mobile really is the future of advertising.

00:38:51.050 --> 00:38:57.110
Almost a platitude at this point. People are
thinking how they can be the Don Draper of

00:38:57.110 --> 00:39:06.690
today to reach audiences and build compelling
ad experiences and that's what drives value.

00:39:06.690 --> 00:39:11.340
I think one thing that I might suggest as
homework, if you are trying to think about

00:39:11.340 --> 00:39:17.020
how these agencies think about advertising
and think about connecting with their user

00:39:17.020 --> 00:39:24.010
bases is to go to dietcoke.com in one tab
and cokezero.com in another tab and try and

00:39:24.010 --> 00:39:33.050
guess who each of those brands is targeting.
So, what about app?S we've talked a lot, like

00:39:33.050 --> 00:39:37.700
Kenneth has been talking about how users are
diverse and how all these different business

00:39:37.700 --> 00:39:43.200
models can play together. We know people like
apps but really, people really, really like

00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:49.180
free apps. 68% of the apps in the Google Play
store are free. Many of those are supported

00:39:49.180 --> 00:39:57.140
by advertising. So advertising is an ongoing
revenue stream and it can be done in any scale.

00:39:57.140 --> 00:40:02.110
Whether it's a small app just growing and
no matter how big it is, the advertising can

00:40:02.110 --> 00:40:05.740
grow with you. There's nothing advertisers
love more than a place where they can reach

00:40:05.740 --> 00:40:13.670
millions of customers that all maybe want
the same thing. So how do we bring this together?

00:40:13.670 --> 00:40:18.660
This is where you guys come in. At developers,
mobile applications can become that newspaper

00:40:18.660 --> 00:40:23.430
publisher that connect businesses to their
potential new customers. We can help do you

00:40:23.430 --> 00:40:31.970
that by connecting through advertisers with
AdMob. It's advertising is something that

00:40:31.970 --> 00:40:36.720
you can scale with your app. On the other
side, this is just worth mentioning as a side

00:40:36.720 --> 00:40:42.300
note, you can actually become an advertiser
yourself using the AdMob network you can promote

00:40:42.300 --> 00:40:49.369
your app to users on over 300,000 of the apps
on our network, and you can even also use

00:40:49.369 --> 00:40:55.130
Google search to promote your app now, too.
This talks more to the point about distribution

00:40:55.130 --> 00:41:00.410
we were talking about earlier, but you can
actually get distribution through advertising

00:41:00.410 --> 00:41:07.220
which can be really, really powerful as well.
And one thing that I think is really neat

00:41:07.220 --> 00:41:12.859
that we announced a few weeks ago that the
AdMob ad network is now connected to the AdWords

00:41:12.859 --> 00:41:17.630
advertising platform. If anybody has ever
bought ads on Google, you would have used

00:41:17.630 --> 00:41:25.270
AdWords, AdWords is used by literally million
of advertisers around the world to confine

00:41:25.270 --> 00:41:28.890
customers. We do that on Google search. We
do that on ad sense today. On the web, which

00:41:28.890 --> 00:41:33.860
you've probably all seen, and now it's actually
possible on AdMob as well. We are starting

00:41:33.860 --> 00:41:38.590
to see these advertisers.
While their Don Draper creative directors

00:41:38.590 --> 00:41:44.650
helped them move into Mobile and move into
apps, and we're really excited to see a much

00:41:44.650 --> 00:41:49.390
wider divert of advertisers going into the
future now that we have this connection to

00:41:49.390 --> 00:41:55.260
AdWords because, you know, a lot of the advertising
up until this point on Mobile has been, you

00:41:55.260 --> 00:41:59.970
know, for other apps or sort of Mobile focus
things and we're trying to grow that pie into

00:41:59.970 --> 00:42:05.220
any type of advertiser which is really exciting.
So how can you build a business with your

00:42:05.220 --> 00:42:09.640
app? Once you've installed the Google AdMob
STK, it's pretty simple, you can choose where

00:42:09.640 --> 00:42:15.000
you want to put your ads, and then we display
ads in the app, and then if users click on

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:20.690
the ads and like them, our advertisers pay
us and we give the lion's share back to you

00:42:20.690 --> 00:42:26.000
guys and you get paid every time a user clicks
on the app. This is pretty basic.

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:31.630
So how does that actually work, though? This
is just some terminology to quickly go through

00:42:31.630 --> 00:42:36.000
here. When you serve an ad in your app, we
call that an impression. Say you have a bunch

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:41.960
of users and you serve 100,000 impressions,
that means that hopefully some of those users

00:42:41.960 --> 00:42:46.240
will find value from those ads and click on
them so that creates a click-through rate,

00:42:46.240 --> 00:42:51.510
let's say 1 1/2% of those impressions get
clicked on, that means that you actually end

00:42:51.510 --> 00:42:58.180
up with 1500 clicks, right, and then we charge
advertisers when a user clicks on their ad,

00:42:58.180 --> 00:43:03.750
and so we then figure out what the price should
be through an auction, we sort of set a market

00:43:03.750 --> 00:43:09.160
price on that click, and then let's say your
cost-per-click is 10 cents or something. What

00:43:09.160 --> 00:43:15.359
that means is you just made $1,500 from those
100,000 impressions. And then the other word

00:43:15.359 --> 00:43:22.260
in the business that we use is RPM which is,
sorry, simply revenue per thousand impressions,

00:43:22.260 --> 00:43:29.100
so RPM in this example would be $1.50.
So how do you implement these ads? It's actually

00:43:29.100 --> 00:43:34.040
pretty simple. This is the on-create method
of a fake Android app we have in our sample

00:43:34.040 --> 00:43:40.060
library on code.google, and basically all
we're doing here is making sure we're in our

00:43:40.060 --> 00:43:46.570
main content view, we're creating a new ad
view object, which has in it the ad unit ID

00:43:46.570 --> 00:43:52.060
you can get once you sign up on AdMob and
then we basically add the ad view to our layout

00:43:52.060 --> 00:43:57.310
and then create an ad request at the end of
this method here.

00:43:57.310 --> 00:44:03.730
So as you can see, we have an ad type banner
which is a sort of basic type and the ad12345

00:44:03.730 --> 00:44:11.760
is your site ID that you signed up for online.
One thing that we announced back in April

00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:18.700
that we think is pretty cool is this thing
called smart banners. One thing that you guys

00:44:18.700 --> 00:44:24.030
may have noticed is that there's lots of different
Android devices out there today and they have

00:44:24.030 --> 00:44:28.350
different screen sizes, right? It can be tricky
that your app actually renders for all these

00:44:28.350 --> 00:44:34.300
different screen sizes and then ads on top
of that, it gets kind of annoying, I think,

00:44:34.300 --> 00:44:38.580
at times. Three devices you are all getting
for free? I think they all have three different

00:44:38.580 --> 00:44:46.820
screen sizes. Anyway, smart banners is actually
a simple but kind of clever optimization that

00:44:46.820 --> 00:44:51.000
we do on your behalf, if you implement smart
banners, you don't actually have to worry

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:54.810
about the width of the screen that you're
going to show the ad on. We will actually

00:44:54.810 --> 00:45:00.010
grow the ad and shrink the ad in horizontal
dimension to make sure it fits. So you don't

00:45:00.010 --> 00:45:05.460
end up with those sort of ugly bars and they
can fit big or small, portrait to landscape,

00:45:05.460 --> 00:45:10.030
it's pretty neat.
So let's talk about what you actually -- what

00:45:10.030 --> 00:45:15.160
we should think about when implementing your
ads. This all gets back to figuring out your

00:45:15.160 --> 00:45:19.890
user engagement patterns and figuring out
what the right place is to actually do this

00:45:19.890 --> 00:45:24.970
sort of thing is. It's going to be different
for every app. So number one, we think it's

00:45:24.970 --> 00:45:30.970
important to really build your app with ads
in mind, right? It's not really good if you

00:45:30.970 --> 00:45:35.380
don't set expectations off the bat that there
are going to be ads in your app and if you

00:45:35.380 --> 00:45:40.730
add them in later your users might not be
very happy about that, right? Two is if you

00:45:40.730 --> 00:45:44.030
have search that's pretty cool, we'll talk
about this in a minute but we have a special

00:45:44.030 --> 00:45:49.200
way of showing ads if your users are searching
for something or issuing some sort of query

00:45:49.200 --> 00:45:54.151
so we can target the ads much better so that's
pretty cool. And then yeah, you have to pay

00:45:54.151 --> 00:45:58.060
attention to your user engagement, if you
know what your users are doing you shouldn't

00:45:58.060 --> 00:46:04.390
screw them up through an ad because that's
not good for anyone. Interrupting in the middle

00:46:04.390 --> 00:46:08.780
of a game might not make sense. Maybe it makes
sense at the end of the level when the user

00:46:08.780 --> 00:46:17.070
will do something else and won't be as interrupted
by the ad. That gets to number four is that

00:46:17.070 --> 00:46:23.160
really try and avoid accidental clicks. You
know, it's sometimes easy, there's not a lot

00:46:23.160 --> 00:46:28.130
of real estate on these phones. Don't put
ads in your controls and things, right, the

00:46:28.130 --> 00:46:33.771
screen is small and if that generates accidental
clicks, it's a bad user experience, people

00:46:33.771 --> 00:46:39.720
are going to be, oh, I don't like that, I
didn't mean to click on this ad. And, you

00:46:39.720 --> 00:46:46.100
know, you need to make sure user engagement
comes first, right? And that's accidental

00:46:46.100 --> 00:46:51.740
clicks also reduce value for advertisers.
And over time that means you won't make as

00:46:51.740 --> 00:46:57.750
much money, right, the advertisers are going
to react and our system will react, so to,

00:46:57.750 --> 00:47:04.841
you know, price those lower value clicks lower
so let's talk about a few examples. First

00:47:04.841 --> 00:47:10.681
is a Korean app called SimSimi, this is an
AI robot from a developer in Korea. So you

00:47:10.681 --> 00:47:15.050
can send a message to SimSimi and it will
send you a message back. So this was really

00:47:15.050 --> 00:47:20.410
popular in Korea when they first launched.
But SimSimi thought they would try to expand

00:47:20.410 --> 00:47:24.780
out globally. They realized it would be difficult
to acquire paid users in lots of different

00:47:24.780 --> 00:47:30.530
countries because there was some craziness
with billing and such like that so they tried

00:47:30.530 --> 00:47:36.010
to do a free approach in some of these markets
using advertising. So these ad revenues allowed

00:47:36.010 --> 00:47:40.869
them to scale up quickly around the world,
download soared to about 15 million and now

00:47:40.869 --> 00:47:46.030
80% of their downloads are actually from these
markets outside of Asia. Now, this is a great

00:47:46.030 --> 00:47:53.070
example of how you can build a real global
business using a combination of advertising

00:47:53.070 --> 00:47:57.810
and other methods and we have a nice quote
from their CEO about how they expanded globally

00:47:57.810 --> 00:48:04.630
and their advertising revenues actually ended
up exceeding their paid revenues in this case.

00:48:04.630 --> 00:48:09.880
Something I alluded to a minute ago about
search ads. This is something I think Google

00:48:09.880 --> 00:48:15.751
does uniquely well. If you have an app that
actually users are interact in a search kind

00:48:15.751 --> 00:48:21.070
of way we can show you highly targeted search
ads that are of more user and of a higher

00:48:21.070 --> 00:48:27.540
value that are the more generic display ads
that are sort of the norm. And so Around Me

00:48:27.540 --> 00:48:30.950
is an app that lets users search for things
around them, restaurants, bars, sort of a

00:48:30.950 --> 00:48:36.530
local search, and they implemented a search
ad which you can see at the top there, it's

00:48:36.530 --> 00:48:43.260
a, yeah, a local bank ad, I guess, and by
doing this they were able to actually earn

00:48:43.260 --> 00:48:48.770
three times higher RPMs than they were regular
display ads and five times higher click-through

00:48:48.770 --> 00:48:53.250
rates using these search ads. They're called
custom search ads for mobile apps and that's

00:48:53.250 --> 00:48:58.170
something you can learn more about at the
developers' sandbox tomorrow.

00:48:58.170 --> 00:49:04.390
Let's talk for a few minutes, we only have
a few minutes left about other ad networks.

00:49:04.390 --> 00:49:07.941
We know AdMob isn't the only ad network in
the market. Maybe you tried one ad network

00:49:07.941 --> 00:49:14.220
to start out with but things are fluctuating,
it's a dynamic market, and no ad network is

00:49:14.220 --> 00:49:20.349
created equal. These RPMs fluctuate and ECPMs
fluctuate depending on all sorts of factors,

00:49:20.349 --> 00:49:24.849
seasonality, demand, and some ad networks
have different strengths, for instance, some

00:49:24.849 --> 00:49:30.530
are very strong in emerging markets, where
others may not be, so it varies per country,

00:49:30.530 --> 00:49:34.980
too. And so soon enough you have three or
four different ad network STKs on your app

00:49:34.980 --> 00:49:41.060
and they're all fluctuating. So what do you
do? You end up mediating. By installing a

00:49:41.060 --> 00:49:45.300
mediation layer, you can actually hopefully
end up ride that curve and figure out what

00:49:45.300 --> 00:49:49.849
your optimal ECPM is from combining all those
networks.

00:49:49.849 --> 00:49:55.250
Mediation acts like a railroad switch. There's
a sort of a wrapper SDK which then controls

00:49:55.250 --> 00:50:04.190
which SDKs it requests ads from. We launched
an AdMob mediation product in April which

00:50:04.190 --> 00:50:12.560
is a free and open feature, part of the AdMob
product, which lets you use almost any ad

00:50:12.560 --> 00:50:21.599
network, and it's also built on Google infrastructure
and lets you choose basically how to organize

00:50:21.599 --> 00:50:25.740
those ad networks, whether it's by sort of
percentage basis of traffic or which of them

00:50:25.740 --> 00:50:31.070
hides the sort of highest ECPMs at the moment.
It also has sort of a nice dashboard, this

00:50:31.070 --> 00:50:34.780
is just a picture of the dashboard, which
as you can see there, you're picking which

00:50:34.780 --> 00:50:39.359
ad network you want to enable, which order
they're in and what their sort of expected

00:50:39.359 --> 00:50:44.270
payouts will be. And one of the great things
about our AdMob mediation product is that

00:50:44.270 --> 00:50:49.450
it's super simple to integrate. This is the
same code we looked at a minute ago about

00:50:49.450 --> 00:50:55.780
how to set up an ad view. To set up a mediation
ad view, all you need to do is so and sign

00:50:55.780 --> 00:51:01.490
up for mediation on our Web site and you get
a new mediation ID which you simply replace

00:51:01.490 --> 00:51:06.691
your reg ad unit ID with your mediation ID
and you're done. So this is really neat. You

00:51:06.691 --> 00:51:13.310
can then simply compile the additional ad
network STKs and we do all the plumbing for

00:51:13.310 --> 00:51:18.810
you. It's actually pretty sweet.
So that's a nice -- mediation is a nice way

00:51:18.810 --> 00:51:25.150
to optimize your ads once you figure out where
they should go and how they should best interact

00:51:25.150 --> 00:51:31.650
with your users.
So, yeah, just there are a lot to anybody

00:51:31.650 --> 00:51:36.650
here, right? We want to help you guys make
money, we want to partner with you because,

00:51:36.650 --> 00:51:44.370
you know, it's something that we like to do
at Google is partner with app developers,

00:51:44.370 --> 00:51:49.360
obviously. And there's a lot of different
products here. You know, we think that we

00:51:49.360 --> 00:51:54.400
have a pretty flexible and comprehensive advertising
platform as well as a direct monetization

00:51:54.400 --> 00:51:59.960
platform with Google Play and hopefully those
are, between the two, how you can make the

00:51:59.960 --> 00:52:05.950
most money from your app on Android and really
build a business out of that. But as we said

00:52:05.950 --> 00:52:13.070
in the beginning, the most important thing
here is to understand how to engage with your

00:52:13.070 --> 00:52:20.040
users and where and when these types of monetization
options are important. Because if you don't

00:52:20.040 --> 00:52:24.910
think critically about that, that's really
the only way to ensure sort of long-term value

00:52:24.910 --> 00:52:28.369
from your users and then consequently from
your business.

00:52:28.369 --> 00:52:32.960
So I highly encourage you guys to stick around
for the promotion talk now and go to the analytics

00:52:32.960 --> 00:52:38.080
talk on Friday as well because I think there's
a lot more to learn about how to actually

00:52:38.080 --> 00:52:43.410
learn to manage these parts of your business.
So thank you very much. Thanks again to Kenneth

00:52:43.410 --> 00:52:46.619
and I think we're actually about out of time.
So enjoy the rest of the day.

00:52:46.619 --> 00:52:46.740
