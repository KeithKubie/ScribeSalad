LAURA TERRY-GREEN: My
name is Laura Terry-Green,

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:07.320
and it gives me great pleasure
to introduce Paula Madison.

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:11.000
I had the privilege of
serving as her college intern

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.600
at NBC Universal, so it's an
honor to have her here today.

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.260
Paula currently serves
as the chairman and CEO

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:22.290
of Madison Media Management, a
Los Angeles based global media

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:24.310
consultancy company.

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:27.020
Paula previously served as
executive vice president

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:30.120
of diversity at NBC
Universal, and vice president

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.950
of General Electric,
the then parent company.

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:36.320
Paula is the recipient of
numerous high profile honors

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:37.270
and awards.

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:41.130
And she was the former franchise
owner of the WNBA's Los Angeles

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:43.040
Sparks basketball team.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.050
Paula is the executive producer
of "Finding Samuel Lowe:

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.940
from Harlem to China," a
compelling documentary that

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:50.880
chronicles her journey
to discovering more

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.290
about her heritage.

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:56.050
Her memoirs, "Finding Samuel
Lowe: China, Jamaica, Harlem,"

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:59.000
were also published
in April of last year.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.520
Paula's journey has been both
extraordinary and compelling.

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.260
And we are fortunate to
have her here with us today.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:09.034
So without further ado, I'd like
to bring up Miss Paula Madison.

00:01:09.034 --> 00:01:12.965
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:17.750
PAULA MADISON: Hello.

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:18.548
AUDIENCE: Hi!

00:01:18.548 --> 00:01:20.173
PAULA MADISON: So
thank you for coming.

00:01:22.744 --> 00:01:24.160
I don't know, I
think I'm supposed

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:28.210
to talk to you about the
strange victory of my life,

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.370
and have you ask some questions,
and I'll try to answer them.

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:35.710
What I like to do at
the very beginning,

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:37.756
although you saw
video of me, but I

00:01:37.756 --> 00:01:39.130
like to do at the
very beginning,

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:44.470
so that we get past
this thing-- which is,

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:45.895
does she look Chinese to you?

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:50.830
So what I like to do
at the very beginning,

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.950
I'm going to remove
my glasses, and you

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:55.100
take a look for yourself.

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.340
And then stop being
distracted, and pay attention

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.680
to what I'm saying.

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:01.680
So here we go.

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.870
This is your moment.

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:07.230
OK, there you go.

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:10.509
Now you can answer for
yourself, but pay attention.

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:14.587
So as Laura said, I had
a pretty varied life.

00:02:14.587 --> 00:02:16.170
And you saw the
little bit in the clip

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:22.905
there, where my oldest
brother talked about where

00:02:22.905 --> 00:02:23.780
we grew up in Harlem.

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.490
My mother was the first
person in our family.

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:31.330
Or so I thought.

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.480
The first person in our family
to come to the United States.

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:40.240
She came in 1945, under the
Chinese immigration quota.

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.530
It's when the Chinese
Exclusion Act was eased.

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.400
How many people know about
the Chinese Exclusion Act?

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.440
Yeah.

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.250
So a lot of folks don't
know that the only nation

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.940
on the planet that the United
States has actually passed laws

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:01.240
to keep that particular nation's
citizens from establishing

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.060
residency in the United
States, is China.

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.570
And beginning in the 1880s,
with some regular frequency,

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:11.220
Congress passed a
series of laws to keep

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.390
Chinese people from
being citizens,

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:16.020
and residents of
the United States.

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:17.400
They could come and work.

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.250
Yes, so they built the
transcontinental railroad

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:21.020
from the west.

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:24.500
You know that famous
picture in Promontory, Utah?

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.220
Which really wasn't
in Promontory,

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.250
which says a whole lot.

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.850
But when they're driving
in that final stake,

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:33.532
connecting the
east and the west.

00:03:33.532 --> 00:03:36.280
There's a lot of
people in that picture

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:37.930
kind of taking credit,
and being really

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:39.650
proud that we got this done.

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:42.840
And not one person in
that photo is Chinese.

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.580
When in fact, the majority
of the workers were Chinese.

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:49.580
Many of them were Hakka.

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:53.310
I was explaining to
Laura at lunch today,

00:03:53.310 --> 00:04:00.350
my multiculturalism and
my multiracial background,

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:04.010
which I don't know
a lot of people

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:06.470
who don't have some kind
of multiracial background.

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:11.420
But in my case, it seems
to be some surprise at,

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:14.280
black and Chinese?

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.240
That's actually very common.

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:18.180
Particularly in the Caribbean.

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:22.250
And particularly throughout
Central and Latin America.

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:26.030
The Chinese people
and Indians who

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:29.650
got to the Caribbean,
which all blended.

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:32.240
Which gives some people
on some of the islands

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.590
a so-called exotic look.

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:39.050
Came about because of
the abolition of slavery.

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:41.130
How does that feed in, you ask?

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:44.620
Well in 1838, when the
British abolished slavery

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:51.720
in its territories, the Africans
who were no longer enslaved

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.210
said, for love or money,
we're not cutting anymore

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:55.980
sugar cane for you.

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:57.600
So they wouldn't work.

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:58.920
For you.

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:02.450
And so the owners of
the sugar plantations

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:04.440
got the next cheapest labor.

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:08.140
They brought indentured
workers from India and China.

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:11.840
And the first Chinese
arrived in Jamaica in 1854.

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:15.000
Now, they didn't generally
let them bring their women,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.700
nor their families.

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:21.170
So who could resist the
beauty of Jamaican women?

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:24.760
Certainly not my grandfather.

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:30.320
So my grandfather actually
had two African Jamaican women

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.190
with whom he had children.

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:34.290
And my mother was
separated from her father

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:36.790
when she was three years old.

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:38.790
The picture of the
woman who you saw,

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:42.750
who looked very-- There were
two photos, side by side.

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:45.760
One looked like a kind
of Chinese woman, in

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:47.995
and the other one
was a black man.

00:05:47.995 --> 00:05:48.870
Those are my parents.

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:55.810
I became very, very, very
aware as a little girl

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:59.000
about racial distinctions.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.300
Differences.

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:02.650
And I became very,
very, very aware,

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:07.880
because my mother, who had
been taken from her father

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:11.690
when she was three years
old, and never saw him again.

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:15.550
This is how the break
in my family happened.

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:19.610
My mother, when I was born--
so I was the last child,

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:21.560
and I was the only girl.

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:24.190
So the first two were
boys, who were welcomed.

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:27.600
Why would you think
they'd be welcomed?

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:29.730
Chinese culture.

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:31.610
Chinese culture,
boys, love boys.

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:33.300
Girls, not so much.

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:35.670
That would be why in some
parts of the country,

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:41.730
in certain eras of history, you
would see whites with strollers

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:43.500
with little Chinese girls.

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:46.010
Because the Chinese girls
were given up for adoption.

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:47.620
They weren't really wanted.

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:53.110
My mother didn't give
me up for adoption, no.

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:56.210
But my mother's hair
was down to here.

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:05.270
My mother recoiled from my hair.

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:10.873
Like, oh my god, what am
I going to do with that?

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:18.350
What was interesting was, when
my mother was three years old,

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:22.440
her mother-- While she
kept her from being

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:27.020
raised with her Chinese father,
her mother didn't want her.

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:30.220
Because she was mixed race.

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:32.610
And there was a certain
amount of shame associated

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:34.480
with that in Jamaica.

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:39.160
Particularly when you're not
with your Chinese family.

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:44.220
So my grandmother, who I
only met once in my life,

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:47.740
pretty much deposited my
mother with her grandmother.

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:50.900
And my mother said every day,
her grandmother would call her,

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:52.750
you half Chinee wretch.

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:55.300
That was, I guess,
her affectionate name

00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:56.510
for her granddaughter.

00:07:56.510 --> 00:08:00.110
And so my mother grew
up between cultures.

00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:05.670
She looked Chinese, was being
raised by African Jamaicans,

00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:07.270
and nobody wanted her.

00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:11.770
Except her Chinese father,
who could not find her.

00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:14.180
When I was a little
girl, my mother

00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:20.400
who had grown up in this kind
of an environment, looked at me.

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:24.850
The last child
and the only girl.

00:08:24.850 --> 00:08:28.730
And had no idea what
to do with my hair.

00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:31.590
Now I don't know
that I necessarily

00:08:31.590 --> 00:08:34.440
want to define this whole
conversation around hair,

00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:37.750
but here's how it starts.

00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:40.929
Most little black girls
had the experience

00:08:40.929 --> 00:08:43.809
of sitting either on
their mother's lap,

00:08:43.809 --> 00:08:46.370
or between their
mother's legs, and having

00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:49.120
their hair combed and braided.

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:51.850
I never had that experience
till I was six years old.

00:08:51.850 --> 00:08:55.200
Not that I walked around with
this wild hair, no, no, no.

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:58.350
But my mother bussed me
upstairs to a nice lady

00:08:58.350 --> 00:09:02.750
from North Carolina, who combed
my hair until I was about six.

00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:07.660
And I think that kind of
created an interesting

00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:10.530
but a little bit
strained relationship

00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:12.320
between me and my mother.

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:16.830
Because, just as
my mother didn't

00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:24.180
have a woman who looked like
her to identify with, right?

00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:28.580
I grew up in Harlem,
with my mother,

00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:31.150
oh absolutely in the house.

00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:35.890
But the identification,
the multiracial-ism

00:09:35.890 --> 00:09:40.500
in our household made
things kind of interesting.

00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:42.360
So when I said
earlier that I was

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:45.480
very aware of
racial distinctions

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:47.650
from a very early
age, and you heard

00:09:47.650 --> 00:09:51.740
that I ended up becoming the
Chief Diversity Officer for NBC

00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:54.820
Universal-- before that I had
a long and storied journalism

00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:55.700
career.

00:09:55.700 --> 00:10:00.010
I ran the news department
for NBC4 in New York City.

00:10:00.010 --> 00:10:01.940
There's so many--
I'm 63 years old.

00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:04.440
There's so many firsts
that I could tell you,

00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:05.430
but you'd be bored.

00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:10.560
And I'm bored by
even-- What I can

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:15.450
say to you is that once I did
all those kinds of things,

00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:19.190
I had a boss who said,
well don't retire early.

00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:20.860
Stay on.

00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:22.735
I want you to run
diversity at NBC Universal.

00:10:22.735 --> 00:10:23.750
And I was like oh, no.

00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:24.390
No, no.

00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:26.300
Not going to do it.

00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:30.200
Because I'm not good
at being a consultant.

00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:33.060
I'm not good at telling people,
I think you should do this.

00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:34.760
But then they ignore you.

00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:37.680
Which in many instances
is what happens

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:40.100
when you are leading diversity.

00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:44.400
Rarely does a diversity
person report to the CEO.

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:50.170
But in my case, because I'm
somewhat strange and demanding,

00:10:50.170 --> 00:10:53.140
unless I reported to the
CEO, we're not even talking.

00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:55.220
So I reported to the CEO.

00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:57.150
But I still said no.

00:10:57.150 --> 00:11:01.900
And about two weeks
before that, my family--

00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:04.170
And nobody in my
company knew this,

00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:06.020
because it was not
their business.

00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:07.520
We were independently wealthy.

00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:08.580
Why do you work?

00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:09.930
Why not.

00:11:09.930 --> 00:11:14.200
So I had planned
to retire early.

00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:16.590
And an individual
approached my family

00:11:16.590 --> 00:11:19.170
about investing in the
Los Angeles Sparks.

00:11:19.170 --> 00:11:20.450
The WNBA team.

00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:22.440
And I was like no,
we like basketball,

00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:23.310
we watch basketball.

00:11:23.310 --> 00:11:25.730
But that's a business, that
I don't know that business.

00:11:25.730 --> 00:11:28.350
And my brothers didn't
know that business.

00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:31.960
But in a short amount of
time, like a week later.

00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:36.330
This radio personality
by the name of Don Imus

00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:38.990
referred to the Rutgers
Women's Basketball team

00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:45.150
as nappy headed-- I
won't say the word.

00:11:45.150 --> 00:11:50.150
Starts with an H, not an N.
It actually starts with a W,

00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:53.660
but you know in street parlance.

00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:55.320
All right, you're right.

00:11:55.320 --> 00:12:01.920
So after that happened, I
was moved to do two things.

00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:05.380
One, I decided not
to retire early.

00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:07.150
Because I was really mad.

00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:10.460
And two, I went to the little
kids in my family, and said,

00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:12.706
hey, you guys want to
own a basketball team?

00:12:12.706 --> 00:12:14.269
Yeah!

00:12:14.269 --> 00:12:15.810
Well, how about we
buy the LA Sparks?

00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:16.810
Yeah!

00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:18.990
And that's how we
got into basketball.

00:12:18.990 --> 00:12:23.590
It's probably the worst
emotional decision I ever made.

00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:26.600
Not because I didn't enjoy
it, and not because I

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:27.570
didn't love basketball.

00:12:27.570 --> 00:12:29.370
Not because I didn't
love our team.

00:12:29.370 --> 00:12:31.120
Because of all that I did.

00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:34.010
But when you have a
team, and although we

00:12:34.010 --> 00:12:37.694
had the only television
contract in the league.

00:12:37.694 --> 00:12:39.360
Local television
contract in the league.

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:43.610
Although we had the highest
attendance in the league,

00:12:43.610 --> 00:12:47.260
you just can't make a
WNBA team profitable.

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:49.190
It's a whole
different conversation

00:12:49.190 --> 00:12:51.860
So when you have a business
that's not profitable,

00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:53.550
what is it?

00:12:53.550 --> 00:12:55.900
It's called a hobby.

00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:57.570
So I sold the team
to Magic Johnson.

00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:06.510
But what it did help me do, was
when I realized that there are

00:13:06.510 --> 00:13:08.120
actually people
walking the planet who

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:12.920
feel very comfortable
saying what Don Imus said--

00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:15.930
Not just in a room, you know?

00:13:15.930 --> 00:13:21.130
But it was broadcast
to millions.

00:13:21.130 --> 00:13:23.870
Well I thought that I should
make him pay for that.

00:13:23.870 --> 00:13:26.870
I thought that I should make
somebody learn from that,

00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:28.280
and so I decided to stay on.

00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:29.500
I decided to not retire.

00:13:32.770 --> 00:13:38.310
I actually had somebody asked
me once, well, you know,

00:13:38.310 --> 00:13:40.430
did working in television
and in news and all

00:13:40.430 --> 00:13:44.150
that, prepare you for being
the Chief Diversity Officer?

00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:46.510
And I was like, no, no.

00:13:46.510 --> 00:13:49.800
Having my mother look
the way my mother looked

00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:53.140
as a single parent,
growing up in Harlem,

00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:55.440
that's what prepared me.

00:13:55.440 --> 00:14:00.380
We used to hang out-- I went to
Catholic school, but-- Not but.

00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:03.480
I went to Catholic school
and, it was in the days

00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:06.502
where everybody just
hung out all the time.

00:14:06.502 --> 00:14:07.960
You played, you
played in the park,

00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:10.690
you just double
dutch, ringolevio,

00:14:10.690 --> 00:14:13.530
we just played New
York City street games.

00:14:13.530 --> 00:14:16.600
And everything would be fine
and cool, and not an issue,

00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:19.077
until my mother
would come outside.

00:14:19.077 --> 00:14:20.660
Oh look, I'm outside,
it's summertime.

00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:21.730
Paula!

00:14:21.730 --> 00:14:23.500
Come in for dinner!

00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:26.220
And depending upon who
I was playing with,

00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:29.510
if that person already knew
my family, and knew my mother,

00:14:29.510 --> 00:14:30.270
it would be cool.

00:14:30.270 --> 00:14:32.520
OK, I'm going to go
and eat, I'll be back.

00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:35.180
But if the person wasn't
familiar with what

00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:37.640
he or she was looking at,
and usually it was a she.

00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:41.910
It would be like, who's that?

00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:45.700
Response, that's my mother.

00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:52.000
Next statement could either
be, oh, then we're cool.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:58.510
Sometimes the statement would
be, that is not your mother.

00:14:58.510 --> 00:15:00.978
Derogatory term used to
describe Chinese people.

00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:07.880
What's the reasonable response?

00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:09.999
You punch them in the face!

00:15:09.999 --> 00:15:11.330
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:13.370
That was my reasonable response.

00:15:13.370 --> 00:15:15.090
So when I was 9
10, 11 years old,

00:15:15.090 --> 00:15:18.990
this is kind-- I don't
even think I took the time

00:15:18.990 --> 00:15:22.130
to ask, what did you say?

00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:24.790
Because at that point, you're
kind of like an amoeba.

00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:26.440
You're just responsive.

00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:27.570
Press that.

00:15:27.570 --> 00:15:31.180
So somebody would say
that, and-- And by the way

00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:32.980
my mother was not
what one would think

00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:38.520
would you know-- that sort
of retiring Chinese woman.

00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:40.600
My mother didn't
grow up like that.

00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:42.560
I have one anecdote to tell you.

00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:45.850
And I'm going to get to
the point of all of this.

00:15:45.850 --> 00:15:49.590
My one anecdote is that, when
my brother, my oldest brother

00:15:49.590 --> 00:15:51.660
was about 13 years old,
he got into a fight

00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:54.120
with a kid who lived
like four blocks away.

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:56.370
And this kid came
from a large family.

00:15:56.370 --> 00:15:58.680
And we had no other
relatives around.

00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:01.380
It was my mother and
her three children.

00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:05.900
And this kid and my brother
got into a fight at the gym.

00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:07.150
And my brother beat him up.

00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:10.430
They were the same
age, same size.

00:16:10.430 --> 00:16:16.890
In finality, the guy ran
and left his sneakers.

00:16:16.890 --> 00:16:19.937
And those being
the spoils of war,

00:16:19.937 --> 00:16:22.270
my brother picked up the
sneakers and brought them home.

00:16:22.270 --> 00:16:23.430
He was never going to wear them.

00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:25.096
But you know, we was
probably going to--

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:28.810
So before all that could happen.

00:16:28.810 --> 00:16:31.220
In our neighborhood, we
had neighborhood runners.

00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:35.320
These are people who, they're
announcing something big

00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:36.310
is happening.

00:16:36.310 --> 00:16:37.830
So we had a first
floor apartment,

00:16:37.830 --> 00:16:39.555
and everybody's doors
were always open.

00:16:39.555 --> 00:16:41.680
So you could hear this kid
running down the street.

00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:42.200
Miss Nell!

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:42.947
Miss Nell!

00:16:42.947 --> 00:16:44.530
This man's coming,
he's going to come.

00:16:44.530 --> 00:16:48.180
He's coming, he's
going to beat up Elric.

00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:50.339
So here is my mother.

00:16:50.339 --> 00:16:51.797
My mother grabbed
the meat cleaver.

00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:57.620
There was not a blade in my
house that was not sharp.

00:16:57.620 --> 00:16:59.590
My mother picked up
the meat cleaver.

00:16:59.590 --> 00:17:02.780
She said to my oldest
brother, Elric, get the bat.

00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:04.650
That was a baseball bat.

00:17:04.650 --> 00:17:06.869
She said Howard,
get the handcuffs.

00:17:06.869 --> 00:17:12.819
Those were handcuffs from, I
think, the First World War.

00:17:12.819 --> 00:17:15.319
They were iron, and
they were really heavy.

00:17:15.319 --> 00:17:18.200
And if you held one side and
you swung it around like a bola,

00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:20.069
you would kill someone.

00:17:20.069 --> 00:17:21.670
So Howard had the handcuffs.

00:17:21.670 --> 00:17:22.839
Paula, bring the cat.

00:17:25.839 --> 00:17:27.804
So we had a cat, Frisky.

00:17:27.804 --> 00:17:32.170
And Frisky was very kind and
gentle, until you tossed her.

00:17:32.170 --> 00:17:34.930
And then Frisky's
claws would just--

00:17:34.930 --> 00:17:36.650
And she would not stop clawing.

00:17:36.650 --> 00:17:37.940
So, Paula, bring the cat.

00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:39.120
So I brought the cat.

00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:40.950
So we all go outside.

00:17:40.950 --> 00:17:43.480
And this man who's more
than six feet tall,

00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:45.770
with four of his sons,
they come down the street.

00:17:45.770 --> 00:17:47.170
And my mother is on the stoop.

00:17:47.170 --> 00:17:48.360
You know the stoop.

00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:49.780
From the tenement.

00:17:49.780 --> 00:17:51.080
And she's like this.

00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:53.142
Oh, it would be on
the other side, sorry.

00:17:53.142 --> 00:17:54.350
Because she was right handed.

00:17:54.350 --> 00:17:58.180
So my mother is leaning,
and she's like this.

00:17:58.180 --> 00:18:00.950
And a gentleman walks
up with his sons,

00:18:00.950 --> 00:18:03.410
and he says to his
son, is that the kid?

00:18:03.410 --> 00:18:05.480
Kid goes yeah.

00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:09.890
And he says-- And before
anything else could happen,

00:18:09.890 --> 00:18:11.900
my mother was at his throat.

00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:15.680
Holding it, and had the meat
cleaver against his jugular.

00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:17.300
Now the people in
my neighborhood,

00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:19.100
they knew Miss Nell.

00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:22.140
And they knew she was
not to be messed with.

00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:23.870
My mother taught me
as a little girl,

00:18:23.870 --> 00:18:25.328
that if you get
into a fight, don't

00:18:25.328 --> 00:18:27.750
stop until the other
person can't get up.

00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:28.910
Now you would think, what?

00:18:28.910 --> 00:18:32.810
Who tells their
child-- Single mother.

00:18:32.810 --> 00:18:33.620
In Harlem.

00:18:33.620 --> 00:18:36.160
And we were the only
people in our neighborhood

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:39.540
who came from what today is
referred to as a broken family.

00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:42.020
Everybody else back then,
the mother and father

00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:43.040
lived in the home.

00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:45.470
We were the only ones
who, that wasn't the case.

00:18:45.470 --> 00:18:52.300
Plus our mother looked
like-- who is that?

00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:54.320
What is she doing here?

00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:58.850
My mother comes from, on
the Chinese side, is Hakka.

00:18:58.850 --> 00:19:01.140
And Hakka women are
the only women in China

00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:04.000
who culturally never
bound their feet.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.010
The culture of Hakka
people is that the women

00:19:06.010 --> 00:19:07.300
didn't bind their feet.

00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:11.060
Do you know what foot
binding is supposed to mean?

00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:12.340
It's beauty.

00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:13.410
Tiny feet.

00:19:13.410 --> 00:19:15.510
So they break your feet
when you're little,

00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:18.010
and they wrap them
and bind them.

00:19:18.010 --> 00:19:22.480
And if your feet are
stumps, you can't walk.

00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:25.160
Now the only way that
you can actually survive,

00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:29.360
is if you're wealthy enough
to have someone carry you.

00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:33.020
So foot binding was a
sign of beauty and wealth.

00:19:33.020 --> 00:19:35.210
Hakka women have always
been industrious.

00:19:35.210 --> 00:19:41.470
Hakka means, I guess in a nice
way, I would say guest people.

00:19:41.470 --> 00:19:43.830
They started out
in northern China.

00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:47.330
And through wars and
dislocation and whatever,

00:19:47.330 --> 00:19:50.310
they ended up moving down and
down and down into the farthest

00:19:50.310 --> 00:19:51.250
part of China.

00:19:51.250 --> 00:19:54.880
Which is the South Easternmost
province, Guangdong province.

00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:58.305
And everywhere the Hakka people
went, they went in a band.

00:19:58.305 --> 00:19:59.680
They'd mix with
the local people,

00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:01.730
but they'd build
their houses, and then

00:20:01.730 --> 00:20:02.802
build walls around them.

00:20:02.802 --> 00:20:05.010
They'd build their villages,
because they were always

00:20:05.010 --> 00:20:05.640
at war.

00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:07.710
So Hakka women,
are the only women

00:20:07.710 --> 00:20:09.090
who didn't bind their feet.

00:20:09.090 --> 00:20:12.940
And they fought
alongside Hakka men.

00:20:12.940 --> 00:20:14.770
So that's one side.

00:20:14.770 --> 00:20:17.470
The other side is Jamaica.

00:20:17.470 --> 00:20:23.240
More than 94% of the people in
Jamaica are Akan, or Ashanti.

00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:24.200
Present day Ghana.

00:20:28.490 --> 00:20:30.620
And there are people
culturally in Jamaica,

00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:32.130
who are known as the Maroons.

00:20:32.130 --> 00:20:35.410
It's a variation of the
Spanish word Cimarrones,

00:20:35.410 --> 00:20:37.390
which means the wild ones.

00:20:37.390 --> 00:20:39.680
So these Maroons,
were the people

00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:42.670
who would come down
from the mountains.

00:20:42.670 --> 00:20:44.160
They'd attack the slave owners.

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:46.230
Oh, and of course kill them.

00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:49.050
And they'd kill any slaves
who wouldn't join them.

00:20:49.050 --> 00:20:53.660
So after a period of time,
the governor of the island

00:20:53.660 --> 00:20:55.349
was told by the King
of England, you've

00:20:55.349 --> 00:20:56.890
got to do a treaty
with these people.

00:20:56.890 --> 00:20:59.110
make them stop killing us.

00:20:59.110 --> 00:21:00.630
And so they signed the treaty.

00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:03.130
And the Maroons
said, OK, we promise.

00:21:03.130 --> 00:21:05.290
We won't kill you guys anymore.

00:21:05.290 --> 00:21:07.930
In exchange for that,
they were given land

00:21:07.930 --> 00:21:09.700
in the hills of Jamaica.

00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:11.610
And the treaty
lasted about a year,

00:21:11.610 --> 00:21:14.095
and then they started
killing them again.

00:21:14.095 --> 00:21:16.220
And that is why the British
stopped bringing slaves

00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:17.470
to Jamaica to be broken in.

00:21:17.470 --> 00:21:19.580
Because it didn't work.

00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:23.780
And the Jamaicans are generally
known as a pretty surly group.

00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:30.470
We are, I guess
prideful, and pugnacious.

00:21:30.470 --> 00:21:32.380
Yeah, I think so.

00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:36.290
So the two most famous Maroons
who you would be familiar with,

00:21:36.290 --> 00:21:40.874
are probably Bob Marley,
and Marcus Garvey.

00:21:40.874 --> 00:21:42.290
And that would be
why, by the way,

00:21:42.290 --> 00:21:44.220
the United States did
not give Jamaicans

00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:46.920
immigration rights for many
years into this country.

00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:47.800
They suspended them.

00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:51.480
Because the Jamaicans
are a very unruly people.

00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:52.800
Yay for us.

00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:54.210
So having said that.

00:21:54.210 --> 00:21:58.220
On both sides of my
mother's lineage,

00:21:58.220 --> 00:22:00.640
she comes from a warrior group.

00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:02.900
So the fighting, and teaching
her children to fight,

00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:04.050
was natural.

00:22:04.050 --> 00:22:05.760
But what also would
happen would be,

00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:10.510
we talked about race and
multiculturalism all the time.

00:22:10.510 --> 00:22:13.990
So given how my
mother looked, right?

00:22:13.990 --> 00:22:16.990
This man walked up on
her son, and he thought

00:22:16.990 --> 00:22:19.790
it was all going to be OK.

00:22:19.790 --> 00:22:22.840
My mother held him here had
the meat cleaver at his neck,

00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:24.664
and said, what are
you doing here?

00:22:24.664 --> 00:22:26.330
And I remember it
like it was yesterday.

00:22:26.330 --> 00:22:31.270
And this man, he was
like-- She said, talk.

00:22:31.270 --> 00:22:32.936
Why are you here?

00:22:32.936 --> 00:22:34.810
And he said, I came to
get my son's sneakers.

00:22:34.810 --> 00:22:36.110
And she said, no you didn't.

00:22:36.110 --> 00:22:38.410
You thought you were
going to hurt my son.

00:22:38.410 --> 00:22:40.220
Then she said, I'll
kill you, right

00:22:40.220 --> 00:22:42.240
in front of your children.

00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:46.860
Even I-- I was like, Whoa, ma.

00:22:46.860 --> 00:22:49.660
Not that I said anything out
loud, because I never-- no.

00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:52.310
Because when Nell was in
that, all you wanted to do

00:22:52.310 --> 00:22:54.510
was breathe gently.

00:22:54.510 --> 00:22:57.650
So it ultimately ended with
her telling him to leave,

00:22:57.650 --> 00:22:59.190
and he did.

00:22:59.190 --> 00:23:01.150
My brother gave
back the sneakers.

00:23:01.150 --> 00:23:04.430
But what it did, was
established reputation.

00:23:04.430 --> 00:23:06.770
It cemented my
mother's reputation.

00:23:06.770 --> 00:23:09.410
My mother was known
for, that's not a woman

00:23:09.410 --> 00:23:10.630
who you want to mess with.

00:23:10.630 --> 00:23:16.230
Counter to, I think, the
stereotype that a lot of people

00:23:16.230 --> 00:23:17.870
had about Chinese people.

00:23:17.870 --> 00:23:20.630
And certainly Chinese
people in Harlem.

00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:22.430
And there were very many.

00:23:22.430 --> 00:23:25.722
This is truly not stereotypical,
but most of the time

00:23:25.722 --> 00:23:27.180
when we encountered
Chinese people,

00:23:27.180 --> 00:23:29.870
they owned a Chinese laundry, or
they had a Chinese restaurant.

00:23:29.870 --> 00:23:31.910
And that was pretty much it.

00:23:31.910 --> 00:23:35.340
What my mother made
certain of was,

00:23:35.340 --> 00:23:37.030
because I think she
was treated the way

00:23:37.030 --> 00:23:39.540
she was treated when
she was a child.

00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:41.990
If you asked my
mother, what are you?

00:23:41.990 --> 00:23:45.690
She would say, I'm Jamaican.

00:23:45.690 --> 00:23:46.260
Yeah but.

00:23:49.128 --> 00:23:51.910
And she'd say, well, now
depending upon the era,

00:23:51.910 --> 00:23:58.120
she'd say I'm colored, or
I'm negro, or I'm black.

00:23:58.120 --> 00:23:58.790
Why?

00:23:58.790 --> 00:24:01.900
Because my mother identified
with her children.

00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:04.110
Which is what no
one did for her.

00:24:04.110 --> 00:24:08.160
My mother made us into a tribe,
and the tribe she made us into

00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:09.040
was this tribe.

00:24:11.570 --> 00:24:12.870
I forgot, one other anecdote.

00:24:12.870 --> 00:24:14.995
When I was in third grade,
I came home from school.

00:24:14.995 --> 00:24:15.700
Catholic school.

00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:17.070
I had my little report card.

00:24:17.070 --> 00:24:18.150
I handed to my mother.

00:24:18.150 --> 00:24:19.690
I was always the A student.

00:24:19.690 --> 00:24:21.010
Always the A student.

00:24:21.010 --> 00:24:23.880
I didn't know how not
to be an A student.

00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:27.810
I hand her my report card, she
looks at me, and leaned in.

00:24:27.810 --> 00:24:30.650
Not Cheryl Sandberg
leaning in, by the way.

00:24:30.650 --> 00:24:33.600
She leaned into my
face, and she said,

00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:35.490
I did not come to
this country for you

00:24:35.490 --> 00:24:40.580
to get a B. Changes
your whole life.

00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:43.210
Generally, children of
immigrants totally get that.

00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:48.800
The expectation
for my mother, was,

00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:50.720
regardless of how
she looked, whatever

00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:53.220
her racial presentation was.

00:24:53.220 --> 00:24:55.130
Her expectations
for her children

00:24:55.130 --> 00:24:58.910
had nothing to do
with traditionally

00:24:58.910 --> 00:25:01.430
how we were expected to perform.

00:25:01.430 --> 00:25:04.910
Because among the things that
my mother told us, was that,

00:25:04.910 --> 00:25:07.340
children perform
frequently to the level

00:25:07.340 --> 00:25:11.940
that adults expect
them to perform.

00:25:11.940 --> 00:25:16.160
So my mother had only gone
as far as second form.

00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:18.080
And my mother taught
us how to read

00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:19.410
when we were three years old.

00:25:19.410 --> 00:25:20.400
Using what?

00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:23.594
The New York Herald
Tribune newspaper.

00:25:23.594 --> 00:25:25.010
Are you supposed
to teach kids how

00:25:25.010 --> 00:25:29.574
to read at three years old
with a daily newspaper?

00:25:29.574 --> 00:25:30.990
That's what my
mother had to read.

00:25:30.990 --> 00:25:33.110
Consequently that's
what we had to read.

00:25:33.110 --> 00:25:38.690
My mother had every expectation
that she came to the United

00:25:38.690 --> 00:25:40.640
States, and it was
our responsibility

00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:41.910
to fulfill her dream.

00:25:41.910 --> 00:25:43.990
And what was her dream?

00:25:43.990 --> 00:25:46.094
Children of immigrants?

00:25:46.094 --> 00:25:48.260
Children of immigrants,
from the South to the North,

00:25:48.260 --> 00:25:50.430
what's the dream?

00:25:50.430 --> 00:25:53.010
To be wealthy.

00:25:53.010 --> 00:25:54.530
To be wealthy!

00:25:54.530 --> 00:25:58.710
To take advantage of what's
offered in this country.

00:25:58.710 --> 00:26:00.534
The streets are paved with gold.

00:26:00.534 --> 00:26:02.450
I mean, when you're
living in another country,

00:26:02.450 --> 00:26:05.667
sometimes these things
don't seem so far fetched.

00:26:05.667 --> 00:26:07.250
When you're living
in another country,

00:26:07.250 --> 00:26:09.040
and you hear that the
child of so-and-so

00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:12.470
grew up to run Standard Oil.

00:26:12.470 --> 00:26:15.430
Or the child of so-and-so
grew up to become President.

00:26:15.430 --> 00:26:18.860
Or the child of so-and-so
owned the railroad.

00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:21.890
These things actually
happened in the United States

00:26:21.890 --> 00:26:22.960
of America.

00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:24.960
So why would an immigrant
think that it couldn't

00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:27.090
happen for her children?

00:26:27.090 --> 00:26:29.600
So my mother's
insistence was, nobody

00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:31.520
can take away your education.

00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:33.600
And I came to this country
for you to be wealthy.

00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:34.710
You grow up to be
wealthy, or I'm

00:26:34.710 --> 00:26:36.501
going to pull your
tongue out of your head.

00:26:36.501 --> 00:26:38.160
Yes mommy.

00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:42.030
So the level of expectation--
we became independently

00:26:42.030 --> 00:26:44.110
wealthy at a pretty early age.

00:26:44.110 --> 00:26:48.240
Because what she
said was, no one

00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:49.740
can take your education away.

00:26:49.740 --> 00:26:51.020
And oh by the way.

00:26:51.020 --> 00:26:55.590
If someone tries to
prevent you from achieving

00:26:55.590 --> 00:27:00.800
what you need to
achieve, you have

00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:02.980
to do what I tell you to do.

00:27:02.980 --> 00:27:05.585
And in her mind, my
mother's motto was--

00:27:05.585 --> 00:27:07.710
and I can't bang on my
chest, because I-- Oh I can,

00:27:07.710 --> 00:27:08.668
because the microphone.

00:27:08.668 --> 00:27:11.770
My mother said, they'd
have to kill me first.

00:27:11.770 --> 00:27:13.490
So that's how we grew up.

00:27:13.490 --> 00:27:14.991
We're either going
to get it done,

00:27:14.991 --> 00:27:16.490
and you get out of
my way, or you're

00:27:16.490 --> 00:27:18.300
going to have to kill me first.

00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:21.630
So with all of that--
With all of that,

00:27:21.630 --> 00:27:25.470
I ended up with a
great sensitivity

00:27:25.470 --> 00:27:27.530
to racial distinctions.

00:27:27.530 --> 00:27:33.200
I grew up understanding
how and why coming

00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:36.100
from two sides of my family.

00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:37.510
There are two
sides of my family,

00:27:37.510 --> 00:27:41.210
my lineage, where there were
lynchings in the United States,

00:27:41.210 --> 00:27:43.220
of my people.

00:27:43.220 --> 00:27:45.660
On the black side, absolutely.

00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:48.090
And on the Chinese side.

00:27:48.090 --> 00:27:50.900
And many people in
this country do not

00:27:50.900 --> 00:27:52.770
know the Chinese
people were lynched.

00:27:52.770 --> 00:27:56.710
The miscegenation laws, which
were passed in this country.

00:27:56.710 --> 00:27:58.590
Most people think it
was to keep the blacks

00:27:58.590 --> 00:28:01.300
and whites from mixing.

00:28:01.300 --> 00:28:02.470
Well it was.

00:28:02.470 --> 00:28:05.020
But it was also used to
keep the Chinese railroad

00:28:05.020 --> 00:28:09.340
workers, and other
labor positions,

00:28:09.340 --> 00:28:12.350
from mixing with
Caucasian women.

00:28:12.350 --> 00:28:18.380
And here in California, what
we don't have in California

00:28:18.380 --> 00:28:20.000
is what we have
in the Caribbean.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:23.970
You know, my grandfather had
three women who he had children

00:28:23.970 --> 00:28:25.530
by in Jamaica.

00:28:25.530 --> 00:28:28.600
Two African Jamaican, and
one was a Chinese bride

00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:31.770
that his parents sent
from China, sight unseen,

00:28:31.770 --> 00:28:32.830
for him to marry.

00:28:32.830 --> 00:28:35.640
And obedient son that
he was, he married.

00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:40.770
And they had it so my
grandfather's total offspring,

00:28:40.770 --> 00:28:42.090
there were eight.

00:28:42.090 --> 00:28:45.510
The first three were biracial,
one was by my grandmother.

00:28:45.510 --> 00:28:48.660
And two was by another
woman, Allison.

00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:51.380
And the other five was by the
Chinese bride who he married,

00:28:51.380 --> 00:28:52.670
Ho Swee Yin.

00:28:55.440 --> 00:29:01.270
The whole point of what was
happening in the Caribbean,

00:29:01.270 --> 00:29:04.430
which was people mixed.

00:29:04.430 --> 00:29:06.740
In the United States,
there were Chinese men

00:29:06.740 --> 00:29:09.320
who were lynched for
mixing with white women,

00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:10.790
or thinking they would.

00:29:10.790 --> 00:29:13.420
And they pretty much got
their point across early.

00:29:13.420 --> 00:29:15.517
So instead, who
did the Chinese men

00:29:15.517 --> 00:29:17.850
mix with, because they weren't
able to bring their wives

00:29:17.850 --> 00:29:20.480
and families?

00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:21.180
Latinas.

00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:23.900
A lot of Mexicans.

00:29:23.900 --> 00:29:30.210
You hear in Latino culture,
people referred to as Chino.

00:29:30.210 --> 00:29:31.035
Nicknamed Chino.

00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:37.030
A good number of Chinese
mixed with Mexicans.

00:29:37.030 --> 00:29:39.530
Native Americans.

00:29:39.530 --> 00:29:42.920
Oh, and African Americans.

00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:47.990
Throughout California, we've had
generations of different races

00:29:47.990 --> 00:29:50.300
mixing with Chinese.

00:29:50.300 --> 00:29:53.360
And a lot of people
are like, what?

00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:56.320
So among the things
that I try to do,

00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:59.180
is have this
conversation out loud.

00:29:59.180 --> 00:30:04.690
Because what we're seeing
happening these days is,

00:30:04.690 --> 00:30:08.220
the changing of this country
demographically in ways

00:30:08.220 --> 00:30:11.410
that for some people It's just
happening, and for other people

00:30:11.410 --> 00:30:12.829
it's quite alarming.

00:30:12.829 --> 00:30:14.870
I'm not even to talk about
the politics of today.

00:30:14.870 --> 00:30:16.616
I will not.

00:30:16.616 --> 00:30:17.990
I'm going to stay
away from that.

00:30:17.990 --> 00:30:21.710
But I want you to understand
that there's an expectation

00:30:21.710 --> 00:30:24.520
that the way
California looks today,

00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:27.279
or the big cities in California,
LA and San Francisco,

00:30:27.279 --> 00:30:29.070
is what the entire
country is going to look

00:30:29.070 --> 00:30:32.370
like in the next 25 years.

00:30:32.370 --> 00:30:34.590
And for some of
us, it's like, yay.

00:30:34.590 --> 00:30:36.690
Why?

00:30:36.690 --> 00:30:41.170
Because I guess maybe contrary
to how my mother's grandmother

00:30:41.170 --> 00:30:43.340
treated her, I find
that these days,

00:30:43.340 --> 00:30:46.670
when you come when you're
in a mixed race environment,

00:30:46.670 --> 00:30:50.697
and there is love involved,
and children are produced,

00:30:50.697 --> 00:30:52.280
it's kind of hard
for the grandparents

00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:54.290
to reject the child.

00:30:54.290 --> 00:30:56.250
I don't usually
see that happening.

00:30:56.250 --> 00:30:59.650
I usually see the grandparents
embrace and love the baby,

00:30:59.650 --> 00:31:02.160
because love is love.

00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:04.630
I bring all this up
because, notice how much

00:31:04.630 --> 00:31:07.412
I've been talking about race?

00:31:07.412 --> 00:31:09.120
I bring all this up
because, I'll bet you

00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:13.070
all don't often talk
about race across lines.

00:31:13.070 --> 00:31:17.700
And when I ran the news
department for NBC in New York,

00:31:17.700 --> 00:31:19.596
I was Assistant News Director.

00:31:19.596 --> 00:31:21.720
I was the number two person
in the news department,

00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:23.460
before I eventually
became the boss.

00:31:23.460 --> 00:31:26.070
But when I first entered
the news department,

00:31:26.070 --> 00:31:28.220
there was an event going on.

00:31:28.220 --> 00:31:30.660
The Central Park Jogger case.

00:31:30.660 --> 00:31:33.140
Have you heard of that?

00:31:33.140 --> 00:31:35.720
And simultaneously,
there was a case

00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:41.450
going on where two young
African American men,

00:31:41.450 --> 00:31:43.870
they were driving along
the highway in New York,

00:31:43.870 --> 00:31:45.260
going to JFK.

00:31:45.260 --> 00:31:48.300
Leaving from JFK airport,
and their car broke down.

00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:50.510
And so they pulled off
onto the side of the road.

00:31:50.510 --> 00:31:52.250
It was before there
was cell phones.

00:31:52.250 --> 00:31:54.770
And they walked into
the neighborhood.

00:31:54.770 --> 00:31:58.670
Because they were looking for
a payphone, to get a tow truck.

00:31:58.670 --> 00:32:01.270
And they walked into a
neighborhood that wasn't

00:32:01.270 --> 00:32:03.240
welcoming to young black men.

00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:11.250
So this group of white
teens chased them down.

00:32:11.250 --> 00:32:13.030
They ran them down.

00:32:13.030 --> 00:32:15.280
The young black men ran
back onto the highway

00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:17.460
to get to their car, and
while running, one of them

00:32:17.460 --> 00:32:19.630
fell, and was hit
by a car and killed.

00:32:19.630 --> 00:32:21.700
So that young man's
name was Yusef Hawkins.

00:32:21.700 --> 00:32:23.950
I don't know if you
are aware of that one.

00:32:23.950 --> 00:32:27.560
So simultaneously, we
had Central Park Jogger,

00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:29.970
we had Yusef Hawkins.

00:32:29.970 --> 00:32:32.830
I had been in the news
room for maybe three weeks

00:32:32.830 --> 00:32:34.880
as Assistant News Director.

00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:38.970
And at the time, I was very
disturbed about the language

00:32:38.970 --> 00:32:42.320
that was being used to
describe these events.

00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:46.360
So I got the scripts for
the six o'clock and the 11

00:32:46.360 --> 00:32:48.280
o'clock newscasts.

00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:51.810
And I redacted the names
of who had written what.

00:32:51.810 --> 00:32:55.990
What reporter, what anchor,
what producer, nobody knew who.

00:32:55.990 --> 00:32:58.550
I made copies of
them, and I gathered

00:32:58.550 --> 00:33:02.270
those communities of people,
and I said here, read these.

00:33:02.270 --> 00:33:07.505
So I'm new, and they're
like, Oh god, oh god, what?

00:33:07.505 --> 00:33:08.630
I said, no, just read them.

00:33:08.630 --> 00:33:09.976
We're going to talk about it.

00:33:09.976 --> 00:33:12.160
Oh, god.

00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:15.570
So we're reading, OK, what.

00:33:15.570 --> 00:33:17.560
And I said, well,
I'd just like for you

00:33:17.560 --> 00:33:21.780
to notice that in
some of the scripts,

00:33:21.780 --> 00:33:25.670
people are referred
to as pack of wolves.

00:33:25.670 --> 00:33:27.640
Some people are referred
to as committing

00:33:27.640 --> 00:33:30.392
something called wilding.

00:33:30.392 --> 00:33:31.850
And in some of the
stories, they're

00:33:31.850 --> 00:33:35.020
just referred to as
a gang of youths.

00:33:35.020 --> 00:33:40.060
Now, what I note is that
the descriptions that

00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:44.760
deal with people in beast
terms, and animalistic terms,

00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:47.360
refer to the Central
Park Jogger case.

00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:50.080
And the gang of youths
are the white kids,

00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:55.020
who chase down two black
teens who just were

00:33:55.020 --> 00:33:58.350
looking to call a tow truck.

00:33:58.350 --> 00:33:59.490
Why are we doing that?

00:33:59.490 --> 00:34:00.980
And they were mortified.

00:34:00.980 --> 00:34:08.060
Mortified, because with
no intent to be racist,

00:34:08.060 --> 00:34:10.179
and to use racist
language and terms,

00:34:10.179 --> 00:34:12.237
that's exactly
what was happening.

00:34:12.237 --> 00:34:14.070
Oh you can bet that
people weren't slouching

00:34:14.070 --> 00:34:16.150
in their seats after that.

00:34:16.150 --> 00:34:20.929
And what I had said was,
the absolute worst time

00:34:20.929 --> 00:34:23.270
to have discussions
around race, is

00:34:23.270 --> 00:34:25.830
when a racist incident occurs.

00:34:25.830 --> 00:34:28.750
Because if you're not
familiar with the language,

00:34:28.750 --> 00:34:33.469
if you're not sensitive to how
people are going to take things

00:34:33.469 --> 00:34:37.020
like, that is not your mama.

00:34:37.020 --> 00:34:43.250
Well I was 9, 10, yeah I'm
going to punch you in your face.

00:34:43.250 --> 00:34:46.909
But as now I'm an adult,
there's gotta be another way

00:34:46.909 --> 00:34:48.626
of handling it, right?

00:34:51.790 --> 00:34:54.630
There's gotta be another
way of handling it.

00:34:54.630 --> 00:34:55.650
Right?

00:34:55.650 --> 00:34:58.870
So what I used to do when I ran
the news department in New York

00:34:58.870 --> 00:35:03.540
is, I deliberately
would have conversations

00:35:03.540 --> 00:35:06.340
around race every day.

00:35:06.340 --> 00:35:12.040
When nothing was-- And people
learned how to be respectful.

00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:16.250
And discuss race and culture.

00:35:16.250 --> 00:35:19.870
The multiculturalism
of this country,

00:35:19.870 --> 00:35:24.680
and the increasing demographic
changes in this country.

00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:27.700
More in the direction
of people of color.

00:35:27.700 --> 00:35:32.220
Really does require that
although we are colleagues,

00:35:32.220 --> 00:35:36.590
and some of us are
even friends, there

00:35:36.590 --> 00:35:39.390
may come a moment
where it's tested.

00:35:39.390 --> 00:35:44.690
And if you've never ever had
that conversation, in a non

00:35:44.690 --> 00:35:51.840
racially explosive circumstance,
it could get a little sticky.

00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:54.180
When I was talking with
Laura, I said well maybe

00:35:54.180 --> 00:35:58.340
you guys should have
weekly-- somebody just

00:35:58.340 --> 00:36:02.302
sit in the what's
it, Charlie's Cafe?

00:36:02.302 --> 00:36:04.800
I got it right!

00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:07.074
And do brown bag lun--
Oh wait, you guys

00:36:07.074 --> 00:36:08.240
don't have to pay for lunch.

00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:09.770
You don't need
brown bag lunches.

00:36:09.770 --> 00:36:11.890
What am I talking about?

00:36:11.890 --> 00:36:15.790
And have people-- Because
in this room, listening in,

00:36:15.790 --> 00:36:18.870
everybody has at
least one story.

00:36:18.870 --> 00:36:21.990
And I don't mean that it
has to be some scary story.

00:36:21.990 --> 00:36:23.990
But you actually are
working with people who you

00:36:23.990 --> 00:36:25.850
think you know reasonably well.

00:36:25.850 --> 00:36:30.310
And how many of us are
really sharing who we are?

00:36:30.310 --> 00:36:32.580
How many of us are really
talking about our culture,

00:36:32.580 --> 00:36:33.800
and our background?

00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:37.210
How many of us are
actually sharing?

00:36:37.210 --> 00:36:40.180
You know I'll go into the
thing about black women,

00:36:40.180 --> 00:36:41.770
because I'm that.

00:36:41.770 --> 00:36:44.080
One of the things that
black women frequently

00:36:44.080 --> 00:36:47.310
get tagged with, is, well,
you know, she's kinda harsh.

00:36:47.310 --> 00:36:48.232
She's tough.

00:36:48.232 --> 00:36:49.565
And I like to call her Sapphire.

00:36:52.710 --> 00:36:54.815
What?

00:36:54.815 --> 00:36:56.220
What?

00:36:56.220 --> 00:37:01.810
And when I worked at GE, and
we had a women's ERG group,

00:37:01.810 --> 00:37:04.330
which was massive.

00:37:04.330 --> 00:37:07.580
And we had one that
was for blacks.

00:37:07.580 --> 00:37:08.920
But we had one for everybody.

00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:11.850
But the one that I
talked about Sapphire in,

00:37:11.850 --> 00:37:15.950
was the one that when I brought
just the black women together.

00:37:15.950 --> 00:37:18.440
And how many of
them, I asked, were

00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:21.030
told that they had
attitude problems?

00:37:21.030 --> 00:37:25.240
You need to tone that down some.

00:37:28.360 --> 00:37:30.890
I would tell people,
I would tell women.

00:37:30.890 --> 00:37:32.700
I would tell black women.

00:37:32.700 --> 00:37:34.640
Make up something.

00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:36.050
What do you mean?

00:37:36.050 --> 00:37:39.310
Say you went to listen to
some jazz over the weekend.

00:37:39.310 --> 00:37:40.760
So you went to a soccer game.

00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:41.980
OK, you didn't.

00:37:41.980 --> 00:37:44.750
But you can't follow the adage
that we've all been told.

00:37:44.750 --> 00:37:46.510
Don't be telling
people your business.

00:37:46.510 --> 00:37:49.074
Because all of us have been
told-- See, she's laughing.

00:37:49.074 --> 00:37:50.740
All of us have been
told by our mothers,

00:37:50.740 --> 00:37:52.000
and our grandmothers,
and aunties,

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:53.833
don't be telling these
people your business.

00:37:53.833 --> 00:37:57.270
Don't tell them-- Well when you
don't, you're not opening up.

00:37:57.270 --> 00:37:59.370
You're not-- How do you
get to be on the team,

00:37:59.370 --> 00:38:02.470
if you don't tell
some of your business?

00:38:02.470 --> 00:38:04.740
I told none of my business.

00:38:04.740 --> 00:38:05.839
I made up stuff.

00:38:05.839 --> 00:38:08.380
Yeah I walked down to Central
Park Summer Stage this weekend,

00:38:08.380 --> 00:38:09.388
it was great.

00:38:09.388 --> 00:38:11.426
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:11.426 --> 00:38:13.050
I didn't see you
there, were you there?

00:38:13.050 --> 00:38:15.120
Oh yeah, I was at
the early show.

00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:18.360
Because you have
to give something.

00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:20.810
I can't be telling-- I'm
still living in Harlem,

00:38:20.810 --> 00:38:24.140
and-- well, let
me leave it alone.

00:38:24.140 --> 00:38:26.010
What I'm saying is
that, and I hope

00:38:26.010 --> 00:38:28.480
you're following where
I'm going with this.

00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:31.026
It's important, it
really is important,

00:38:31.026 --> 00:38:32.400
particularly for
those of you who

00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:37.700
are working in this new
frontier, Google land.

00:38:37.700 --> 00:38:38.310
You Googlers.

00:38:41.060 --> 00:38:43.810
It's a brand new
frontier for you.

00:38:43.810 --> 00:38:47.770
If we called you pioneers, I
would put it in the context of,

00:38:47.770 --> 00:38:50.020
then don't do the
same old stupid stuff

00:38:50.020 --> 00:38:52.730
that people were doing before.

00:38:52.730 --> 00:38:54.340
This is an opportunity.

00:38:54.340 --> 00:38:58.280
I just learned, you don't have
to do your own dry cleaning,

00:38:58.280 --> 00:39:00.600
you ain't got to pay for lunch.

00:39:00.600 --> 00:39:03.770
You all get driven to work
in some big white bus.

00:39:03.770 --> 00:39:08.030
I'm like, you know this
is not the real world.

00:39:08.030 --> 00:39:11.990
And given all of
that opportunity

00:39:11.990 --> 00:39:17.420
to use your whatever,
for whatever,

00:39:17.420 --> 00:39:19.350
maybe one of the things
that can happen is you

00:39:19.350 --> 00:39:26.180
can foster-- Be on the
cutting edge of fostering

00:39:26.180 --> 00:39:28.895
a better level of interaction.

00:39:31.930 --> 00:39:35.700
Greater quality of,
whether it's camaraderie,

00:39:35.700 --> 00:39:38.830
or actual friendship.

00:39:38.830 --> 00:39:39.330
OK.

00:39:39.330 --> 00:39:41.690
One last anecdote, and
then I'll take a question.

00:39:41.690 --> 00:39:45.170
My last anecdote is, when
I was a new newspaper

00:39:45.170 --> 00:39:46.890
reporter, reasonably new.

00:39:46.890 --> 00:39:50.020
I was sitting at my desk,
and the hot shot reporters,

00:39:50.020 --> 00:39:52.749
all of whom were white males,
were standing near my desk.

00:39:52.749 --> 00:39:54.290
And I'm writing
whatever I'm writing.

00:39:54.290 --> 00:39:55.748
And they're sitting
there chatting.

00:39:55.748 --> 00:39:58.690
And one of them said, yeah, it
was like a Chinese fire drill.

00:39:58.690 --> 00:40:00.010
Caught my ear.

00:40:00.010 --> 00:40:01.690
I'm like, oh?

00:40:01.690 --> 00:40:03.760
What is that?

00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:08.170
So, inquisitive person
that I am, I said,

00:40:08.170 --> 00:40:10.310
hey, what's a
Chinese fire drill?

00:40:10.310 --> 00:40:13.620
Oh you know what a
Chinese fire drill is.

00:40:13.620 --> 00:40:15.177
No actually I don't.

00:40:15.177 --> 00:40:17.010
Oh that's like when you
were in high school,

00:40:17.010 --> 00:40:18.510
and you were driving
a car-- I said,

00:40:18.510 --> 00:40:20.060
I grew up in Harlem on welfare.

00:40:20.060 --> 00:40:22.070
It would not be driving a car.

00:40:22.070 --> 00:40:22.570
No.

00:40:22.570 --> 00:40:23.810
It's the subway and the bus.

00:40:23.810 --> 00:40:25.560
So I don't know what
you're talking about.

00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:27.067
It's oh, you pull up to a light.

00:40:27.067 --> 00:40:28.900
It's like the car is
full, like four people.

00:40:28.900 --> 00:40:30.730
Everybody opens the
doors at a red light,

00:40:30.730 --> 00:40:32.855
everyone runs around the
car, and they get back in.

00:40:35.530 --> 00:40:38.110
And why is that a
Chinese fire drill?

00:40:38.110 --> 00:40:41.190
And literally, the guy says,
oh you know, Chinese people.

00:40:41.190 --> 00:40:42.410
Ching chong bong, long.

00:40:42.410 --> 00:40:44.743
You know, who could understand
what it-- It's confusion.

00:40:47.410 --> 00:40:52.360
At which point, I stood
up to my full height.

00:40:52.360 --> 00:40:55.280
And I became 11 years old again.

00:40:55.280 --> 00:40:57.560
I didn't hit him.

00:40:57.560 --> 00:41:02.800
But I said, if you say
that around me again, I'm

00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:06.240
going to you up.

00:41:06.240 --> 00:41:08.030
That's me against four
white guys, right?

00:41:08.030 --> 00:41:08.780
Four guys.

00:41:08.780 --> 00:41:11.346
And it's me, and I'm new.

00:41:11.346 --> 00:41:15.610
They looked at me, and I said,
because here's what I know.

00:41:15.610 --> 00:41:20.130
What I know is, that
when I'm not present,

00:41:20.130 --> 00:41:22.040
the slur you're going
to use is going to be

00:41:22.040 --> 00:41:24.640
about people who look like me.

00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:28.820
So my advice to you
is, don't do it at all.

00:41:28.820 --> 00:41:30.963
At which point, I sat back down.

00:41:30.963 --> 00:41:33.046
I said, oh by the way, my
grandfather was Chinese.

00:41:33.046 --> 00:41:34.830
They're like, oh god, whatever.

00:41:38.660 --> 00:41:39.790
It's important.

00:41:39.790 --> 00:41:42.250
It really is important
in this day and age

00:41:42.250 --> 00:41:47.390
that race, gender, culture,
nationality, all the above

00:41:47.390 --> 00:41:53.720
is taken into account in a
variety of social environments.

00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:56.390
And you all spend more
time with each other

00:41:56.390 --> 00:41:57.890
than you spend with
people you love,

00:41:57.890 --> 00:41:59.970
unless you love
somebody at work.

00:41:59.970 --> 00:42:03.190
Which could be a little dicey.

00:42:03.190 --> 00:42:05.500
So I would only suggest
that what you think about,

00:42:05.500 --> 00:42:08.260
particularly because you
do have the opportunity

00:42:08.260 --> 00:42:11.500
to come together in various
groupings and settings,

00:42:11.500 --> 00:42:16.920
to talk about how to get
past and over this hump.

00:42:16.920 --> 00:42:22.370
And make it a more meaningful
social interaction.

00:42:22.370 --> 00:42:23.970
Questions?

00:42:23.970 --> 00:42:25.650
Thank you.

00:42:25.650 --> 00:42:29.436
[APPLAUSE]

00:42:29.436 --> 00:42:31.560
If anybody does have a
question, and I hope you do,

00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:33.809
there's a microphone there
that you have to talk into,

00:42:33.809 --> 00:42:38.750
so that the people out
there in the disembodied out

00:42:38.750 --> 00:42:41.265
there can hear what
the question is.

00:42:41.265 --> 00:42:41.890
ANNE: Hi there.

00:42:41.890 --> 00:42:42.810
Thanks for coming.

00:42:42.810 --> 00:42:43.851
PAULA MADISON: Thank you.

00:42:43.851 --> 00:42:46.349
ANNE: And as a Greek American
woman from Philadelphia,

00:42:46.349 --> 00:42:48.640
I can resonate with some of
the things you were saying,

00:42:48.640 --> 00:42:50.492
about being called
a little harsh,

00:42:50.492 --> 00:42:51.700
a little this, a little that.

00:42:51.700 --> 00:42:53.120
So thank you for those comments.

00:42:53.120 --> 00:42:53.490
PAULA MADISON: Sure.

00:42:53.490 --> 00:42:54.698
ANNE: So my question for you.

00:42:54.698 --> 00:42:56.670
I've also lived through
the '90s, right.

00:42:56.670 --> 00:43:00.570
And the '90s, I think of that
as a time when people were

00:43:00.570 --> 00:43:03.130
aware of the language they
used, but what resulted

00:43:03.130 --> 00:43:04.380
was the era of PC.

00:43:04.380 --> 00:43:06.050
Which I personally
wasn't a fan of.

00:43:06.050 --> 00:43:08.950
Because we were all
being so careful,

00:43:08.950 --> 00:43:10.856
that everyone was
afraid to talk.

00:43:10.856 --> 00:43:12.730
And I don't really have
any interest in that.

00:43:12.730 --> 00:43:14.430
So I agree that
dialogue is important,

00:43:14.430 --> 00:43:16.440
and I agree that we have
to talk about these things.

00:43:16.440 --> 00:43:18.231
And I loved the point
you made about having

00:43:18.231 --> 00:43:20.440
the conversation in
a non heated moment,

00:43:20.440 --> 00:43:21.940
because I think
that's not something

00:43:21.940 --> 00:43:23.023
I've thought about before.

00:43:23.023 --> 00:43:24.720
And I think that's
incredibly useful.

00:43:24.720 --> 00:43:26.506
How do we do that
without ending up

00:43:26.506 --> 00:43:28.130
with people who are
maybe a little less

00:43:28.130 --> 00:43:31.210
comfortable with that
conversation then feeling

00:43:31.210 --> 00:43:33.450
like they can't speak at
all, which ruins the point?

00:43:33.450 --> 00:43:34.470
PAULA MADISON: Right.

00:43:34.470 --> 00:43:35.180
Great question.

00:43:35.180 --> 00:43:37.030
Tell me your name?

00:43:37.030 --> 00:43:37.700
ANNE: I'm Anne.

00:43:37.700 --> 00:43:38.780
PAULA MADISON: Anne.

00:43:38.780 --> 00:43:39.700
Thank you for that.

00:43:42.230 --> 00:43:45.880
When I was 51, I started
running marathons.

00:43:45.880 --> 00:43:47.980
I know, because I'm crazy.

00:43:47.980 --> 00:43:52.980
And I didn't know you could
train to run a marathon.

00:43:52.980 --> 00:43:54.960
I was like, oh, a coach!

00:43:54.960 --> 00:43:56.240
Really!

00:43:56.240 --> 00:43:57.690
I know how to run.

00:43:57.690 --> 00:43:58.940
Like, you just run!

00:43:58.940 --> 00:43:59.750
No, no, no.

00:43:59.750 --> 00:44:01.347
It's a different
kind of running.

00:44:01.347 --> 00:44:02.930
So my husband, who
by then had already

00:44:02.930 --> 00:44:07.460
run like 9 or 10 marathons,
is like, baby listen.

00:44:07.460 --> 00:44:10.100
He said, I've only ever
seen you run for the train.

00:44:10.100 --> 00:44:11.900
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:11.900 --> 00:44:14.160
And I said, and?

00:44:14.160 --> 00:44:16.210
He said, do you know
how long a marathon is?

00:44:16.210 --> 00:44:17.600
I said 26.2 miles.

00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:18.670
I know how long it is.

00:44:18.670 --> 00:44:21.484
He said, well, maybe you
should start with a 5k.

00:44:21.484 --> 00:44:23.150
I said, are you trying
to discourage me?

00:44:23.150 --> 00:44:24.660
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

00:44:24.660 --> 00:44:25.740
And I said, what's a k?

00:44:25.740 --> 00:44:26.240
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:26.740
Truly.

00:44:26.740 --> 00:44:28.360
That's true conversation.

00:44:28.360 --> 00:44:31.620
So I had a running partner.

00:44:31.620 --> 00:44:35.750
Who, lovely woman, one of
my dearest friends now.

00:44:35.750 --> 00:44:38.530
And she's probably 10,
12 years older than me.

00:44:38.530 --> 00:44:39.880
And she's Jewish.

00:44:39.880 --> 00:44:45.050
And while running, we talked
about all kinds of things.

00:44:45.050 --> 00:44:49.810
It's really hard to be
really mad at somebody

00:44:49.810 --> 00:44:52.190
when today is a 12 mile run.

00:44:52.190 --> 00:44:53.130
You understand?

00:44:53.130 --> 00:44:57.330
You figure out
whether it's quilting,

00:44:57.330 --> 00:45:00.900
whether it's playing
Minecraft, whatever

00:45:00.900 --> 00:45:03.880
it is that's the common
bond, and then you

00:45:03.880 --> 00:45:05.420
get beyond the superficial.

00:45:05.420 --> 00:45:08.160
Yeah we talked about cookies,
and grandchildren of course.

00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:10.350
But there would
be points where we

00:45:10.350 --> 00:45:15.220
got into some really meaningful,
serious, and potentially

00:45:15.220 --> 00:45:16.970
dangerous discussions.

00:45:16.970 --> 00:45:21.380
But we had enough trust in each
other to know that this is not

00:45:21.380 --> 00:45:23.930
cocktail party banter.

00:45:23.930 --> 00:45:28.420
And she is one of my
dearest, and closest friends.

00:45:28.420 --> 00:45:30.150
It's hard not to be
friends with somebody

00:45:30.150 --> 00:45:31.570
who you're sweating on.

00:45:31.570 --> 00:45:33.610
Well, I think.

00:45:33.610 --> 00:45:37.010
But anyway, you get my--
it can't be sitting across

00:45:37.010 --> 00:45:40.870
from each other at work, where
we both have a bottle of water,

00:45:40.870 --> 00:45:44.660
and I want to talk
to you about-- that's

00:45:44.660 --> 00:45:46.910
too- it's too focused.

00:45:46.910 --> 00:45:47.870
It's too whatever.

00:45:47.870 --> 00:45:50.464
And in an environment
like this, quite honestly,

00:45:50.464 --> 00:45:52.130
the best way to have
these conversations

00:45:52.130 --> 00:45:53.540
is to have them moderated.

00:45:53.540 --> 00:45:54.560
Or brokered.

00:45:54.560 --> 00:45:56.150
Have somebody who
really does know

00:45:56.150 --> 00:46:00.860
how to encourage the
discussion, and can

00:46:00.860 --> 00:46:05.290
tell when it may be
getting-- So talk about what

00:46:05.290 --> 00:46:09.200
you meant by that, as opposed
to, what did you mean by that?

00:46:09.200 --> 00:46:10.270
You know?

00:46:10.270 --> 00:46:11.510
Yeah.

00:46:11.510 --> 00:46:13.019
Yes.

00:46:13.019 --> 00:46:15.060
AUDIENCE: So that was a
really interesting point.

00:46:15.060 --> 00:46:17.351
And you're talking about
having a moderator in a group.

00:46:17.351 --> 00:46:20.050
But how can you kind of
organically facilitate that?

00:46:20.050 --> 00:46:23.854
Because my assumption, and this
I guess, is a generalization,

00:46:23.854 --> 00:46:25.270
is that the people
who are already

00:46:25.270 --> 00:46:27.520
somewhat interested
in that already,

00:46:27.520 --> 00:46:28.910
are the ones who attend.

00:46:28.910 --> 00:46:29.410
Right?

00:46:29.410 --> 00:46:31.940
And so we don't need
a homogeneous group

00:46:31.940 --> 00:46:33.989
to consistently have
this conversation.

00:46:33.989 --> 00:46:36.530
You kind of want to spread it
to the group that maybe doesn't

00:46:36.530 --> 00:46:37.850
have any interest in attending.

00:46:37.850 --> 00:46:39.680
So how do you have that
organically happen,

00:46:39.680 --> 00:46:42.312
without forcing someone to go
to a round table or something?

00:46:42.312 --> 00:46:44.020
PAULA MADISON: Right,
I don't believe you

00:46:44.020 --> 00:46:46.571
can have it happen organically.

00:46:46.571 --> 00:46:47.820
AUDIENCE: You cannot have it--

00:46:47.820 --> 00:46:49.819
PAULA MADISON: I don't
think you can organically

00:46:49.819 --> 00:46:53.300
have people say, today,
let's talk about scary issue

00:46:53.300 --> 00:46:57.020
about-- I don't think that
organically, that can happen.

00:46:57.020 --> 00:46:59.160
I think that it has
to be purposeful.

00:46:59.160 --> 00:47:01.820
I think that there has
to be a decision made,

00:47:01.820 --> 00:47:03.840
somewhere along the line.

00:47:03.840 --> 00:47:05.840
Whether it comes out of
HR, whether it comes out

00:47:05.840 --> 00:47:08.350
of a management group, whether
it comes out of somewhere.

00:47:08.350 --> 00:47:12.850
But somebody who
says, look, this

00:47:12.850 --> 00:47:14.140
is my first time at Google.

00:47:14.140 --> 00:47:16.470
The only person I know
at Google is Laura.

00:47:16.470 --> 00:47:19.060
And maybe some of you now.

00:47:19.060 --> 00:47:23.070
But if this is an
environment where

00:47:23.070 --> 00:47:27.620
you get your clothes cleaned,
you get your laundry done.

00:47:27.620 --> 00:47:30.050
I don't even know what
else you all get for free.

00:47:30.050 --> 00:47:32.630
[LAUGHTER] But if
it's designed to

00:47:32.630 --> 00:47:39.290
enrich-- if it's designed
to smooth and tamp down

00:47:39.290 --> 00:47:43.700
distractions, so you can have
an enriched, more effective

00:47:43.700 --> 00:47:47.710
and efficient
experience here, look

00:47:47.710 --> 00:47:50.940
at what you're not discussing.

00:47:50.940 --> 00:47:55.870
Look at what is not
being discussed at all.

00:47:55.870 --> 00:48:02.170
And how much more risk, and
it is risky, no question.

00:48:02.170 --> 00:48:04.710
When I was at NBC Universal,
we brought everybody together,

00:48:04.710 --> 00:48:08.420
on something called
NBC Unity Day.

00:48:08.420 --> 00:48:10.950
And we dealt with a
lot of these things,

00:48:10.950 --> 00:48:12.840
with the blessing
and the encouragement

00:48:12.840 --> 00:48:14.890
of the tip-top most management.

00:48:14.890 --> 00:48:19.410
Because you can't just make
this up, and say, so now,

00:48:19.410 --> 00:48:21.240
every Wednesday we're
going to gather.

00:48:21.240 --> 00:48:24.050
Because without it
being moderated,

00:48:24.050 --> 00:48:25.390
it could get real dicey.

00:48:29.260 --> 00:48:33.710
So the premise of organic, I
don't think it can be organic.

00:48:33.710 --> 00:48:34.502
Not at work.

00:48:34.502 --> 00:48:36.460
MAR JAYE: I actually have
an alternative there.

00:48:36.460 --> 00:48:37.140
My name's Mar Jaye.

00:48:37.140 --> 00:48:39.098
Thank you so much for
coming Miss Madison, that

00:48:39.098 --> 00:48:40.450
was an incredible lecture.

00:48:40.450 --> 00:48:45.260
But we do have a Group here
that was created organically,

00:48:45.260 --> 00:48:48.090
in some way, called
Equality Working Group.

00:48:48.090 --> 00:48:50.370
So if you go to your
internal Google Group,

00:48:50.370 --> 00:48:56.580
and look that alias up,
we have monthly lunches.

00:48:56.580 --> 00:49:00.190
Where people of all
types from Google,

00:49:00.190 --> 00:49:01.810
we come together and have lunch.

00:49:01.810 --> 00:49:03.590
And it's really
great, because you're

00:49:03.590 --> 00:49:06.450
engaging with people who you
would probably never talk to.

00:49:06.450 --> 00:49:11.680
Because a lot of us, we
silo ourselves in every way,

00:49:11.680 --> 00:49:15.030
with people who look like us, or
talk like us, or think like us.

00:49:15.030 --> 00:49:18.620
So it's a really cool
way for different people

00:49:18.620 --> 00:49:20.070
to get together, to engage.

00:49:20.070 --> 00:49:25.000
And we talk a lot about
race, and gender issues,

00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:26.160
and things like that.

00:49:26.160 --> 00:49:28.070
I mean people ask questions.

00:49:28.070 --> 00:49:32.030
They're like, well why does
a black person feel this way?

00:49:32.030 --> 00:49:34.560
They just don't
know, and they need

00:49:34.560 --> 00:49:37.680
some help to kind of
understand and walk

00:49:37.680 --> 00:49:39.817
through someone else's
shoes to understand that.

00:49:39.817 --> 00:49:42.400
And so we put ourselves in this
really safe environment, where

00:49:42.400 --> 00:49:43.750
we can do this here at Google.

00:49:43.750 --> 00:49:46.220
So I would encourage you guys
to look up the Working Group

00:49:46.220 --> 00:49:47.262
and come have lunch.

00:49:47.262 --> 00:49:48.720
PAULA MADISON: I
think that's great

00:49:48.720 --> 00:49:51.290
if you all have been
able to come together,

00:49:51.290 --> 00:49:56.320
and pretty much-- maybe, I
don't know what the word-- but

00:49:56.320 --> 00:49:58.170
leave any kind of
hostility that could

00:49:58.170 --> 00:49:59.870
come from that at the door.

00:49:59.870 --> 00:50:04.890
My experience is that, it
can get there really quickly,

00:50:04.890 --> 00:50:06.870
if not.

00:50:06.870 --> 00:50:09.710
But if what you all have done
is create that environment,

00:50:09.710 --> 00:50:11.025
I applaud you.

00:50:11.025 --> 00:50:12.150
Because that's spectacular.

00:50:12.150 --> 00:50:14.080
That's a rare thing to happen.

00:50:14.080 --> 00:50:18.354
So maybe free lunches and free
cleaning does make you nicer.

00:50:18.354 --> 00:50:19.340
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:19.340 --> 00:50:20.140
MAR JAYE: Yeah.

00:50:20.140 --> 00:50:21.850
And I think the
great thing here is

00:50:21.850 --> 00:50:24.395
that, like you were saying,
how do we bring people?

00:50:24.395 --> 00:50:27.730
Because you're right, people
come who are naturally,

00:50:27.730 --> 00:50:29.384
they want to engage in this way.

00:50:29.384 --> 00:50:31.550
But there's a lot of people
who probably don't come,

00:50:31.550 --> 00:50:35.010
because they're in
exact opposite feeling.

00:50:35.010 --> 00:50:36.950
So we encourage everyone
to bring somebody

00:50:36.950 --> 00:50:39.050
you know, who would
never come to this,

00:50:39.050 --> 00:50:42.810
If you weren't their friend,
and encourage them to.

00:50:42.810 --> 00:50:44.810
PAULA MADISON: You should
be applauded for that.

00:50:44.810 --> 00:50:46.770
I don't know if you all have
like in-house communications.

00:50:46.770 --> 00:50:48.228
Tell me how much
more time we have?

00:50:48.228 --> 00:50:50.360
I don't know if you have
in-house communications,

00:50:50.360 --> 00:50:52.890
but maybe you can let people
know that that happens.

00:50:52.890 --> 00:50:56.610
Because that, I think,
is a game changer.

00:50:56.610 --> 00:51:03.340
Having worked in so many places,
and in so many different roles

00:51:03.340 --> 00:51:04.400
throughout my life.

00:51:04.400 --> 00:51:08.300
What I have found
is that, it's tough.

00:51:08.300 --> 00:51:13.650
It's real, and people, it gets
sometimes stuck right here.

00:51:13.650 --> 00:51:15.390
Oh, so I do have
one more anecdote.

00:51:15.390 --> 00:51:17.720
And again, I'm sorry all my
anecdotes involve violence.

00:51:17.720 --> 00:51:18.886
I apologize.

00:51:18.886 --> 00:51:21.020
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:21.020 --> 00:51:24.250
When I was in college,
which was many moons ago,

00:51:24.250 --> 00:51:31.290
there was a an African American
student, and a white student.

00:51:31.290 --> 00:51:33.460
And they both lived in
the same dorm, both women.

00:51:33.460 --> 00:51:35.626
And the white student said
to the African American--

00:51:35.626 --> 00:51:38.560
and they were in the
bathroom-- and she

00:51:38.560 --> 00:51:41.370
said, can I touch your hair?

00:51:41.370 --> 00:51:43.830
And the black student said no.

00:51:43.830 --> 00:51:46.650
And the white student said, no,
but I just want to touch it.

00:51:46.650 --> 00:51:49.960
And the black student
said, don't touch my hair.

00:51:49.960 --> 00:51:53.580
She actually was trimming
her afro at the time.

00:51:53.580 --> 00:51:55.810
The white student reached
out, and touched her hair.

00:51:55.810 --> 00:51:57.726
And the black student
stabbed her in the hand.

00:52:01.020 --> 00:52:02.330
Right?

00:52:02.330 --> 00:52:05.610
So what I'm getting
at is, what may

00:52:05.610 --> 00:52:10.170
be comfortable for some people,
like-- So with my friend,

00:52:10.170 --> 00:52:12.850
my marathon partner, we would
have conversations about stuff,

00:52:12.850 --> 00:52:14.641
and I'd say, you know
can't be just talking

00:52:14.641 --> 00:52:17.080
to every black person
about this, right?

00:52:17.080 --> 00:52:19.629
You've got to go slowly.

00:52:19.629 --> 00:52:21.170
But don't be walking
up to people who

00:52:21.170 --> 00:52:23.240
you barely know, and say hey!

00:52:23.240 --> 00:52:25.560
Because it could go very wrong.

00:52:25.560 --> 00:52:27.270
So that's what I'm saying.

00:52:27.270 --> 00:52:28.970
You all have created
an environment

00:52:28.970 --> 00:52:33.820
in your group, where
there are ground rules.

00:52:33.820 --> 00:52:37.160
And there are people around
who could serve as referees,

00:52:37.160 --> 00:52:39.220
and moderators, who
are inside the group.

00:52:39.220 --> 00:52:42.970
Because somehow you all
have come to an agreement,

00:52:42.970 --> 00:52:45.530
that this is how we're all
going to conduct ourselves.

00:52:45.530 --> 00:52:46.910
Which I applaud you for.

00:52:46.910 --> 00:52:48.042
I think that's spectacular.

00:52:48.042 --> 00:52:48.750
MAR JAYE: Thanks.

00:52:48.750 --> 00:52:50.290
And I did want to give
one more anecdote,

00:52:50.290 --> 00:52:51.850
because I think it's
something that--

00:52:51.850 --> 00:52:54.120
PAULA MADISON: Does
yours involve violence?

00:52:54.120 --> 00:52:57.297
MAR JAYE: It involves
racism in the workplace.

00:52:57.297 --> 00:52:58.130
I had an experience.

00:52:58.130 --> 00:53:00.490
I work in advertising
here at Google,

00:53:00.490 --> 00:53:03.610
and I talk on the phone
with companies a lot.

00:53:03.610 --> 00:53:06.330
And marketing reps, and things.

00:53:06.330 --> 00:53:11.540
I was confused for,
I guess the person

00:53:11.540 --> 00:53:14.390
I was talking to thought
I was a white person.

00:53:14.390 --> 00:53:17.290
And this happened twice, in
my five years here at Google.

00:53:17.290 --> 00:53:20.370
And they started to
say something racist.

00:53:20.370 --> 00:53:24.040
What the first call was, about
Muslims, and then the other one

00:53:24.040 --> 00:53:25.730
was about black people.

00:53:25.730 --> 00:53:27.730
They assuming I was white.

00:53:27.730 --> 00:53:33.640
So I really encourage people
to be allies to all races,

00:53:33.640 --> 00:53:36.350
because that was the
first time in my life

00:53:36.350 --> 00:53:42.650
I was able to actually
fight and support

00:53:42.650 --> 00:53:44.320
a minority, being a minority.

00:53:44.320 --> 00:53:45.500
That doesn't happen to me.

00:53:45.500 --> 00:53:51.150
But in this unique situation, I
had the power to actually say,

00:53:51.150 --> 00:53:52.550
well that's not right.

00:53:52.550 --> 00:53:54.810
Because here they are,
thinking I'm white.

00:53:54.810 --> 00:53:58.070
And so when you are
speaking with your peers,

00:53:58.070 --> 00:54:00.790
you have a lot more power
to change the narrative

00:54:00.790 --> 00:54:04.270
than you do when you are usually
the one that's disenfranchised.

00:54:04.270 --> 00:54:08.170
Because a lot of times it goes
out one ear, and out the other

00:54:08.170 --> 00:54:11.000
when you're the person
being disenfranchised,

00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:15.160
speaking about your situation.

00:54:15.160 --> 00:54:19.220
So I really encourage allies of
everyone to really speak out.

00:54:19.220 --> 00:54:22.540
Because it actually gets
through deeper than I think

00:54:22.540 --> 00:54:24.099
it might otherwise.

00:54:24.099 --> 00:54:25.640
PAULA MADISON: And
I have a question.

00:54:25.640 --> 00:54:28.210
Did you tell-- In
the situation where

00:54:28.210 --> 00:54:32.560
it was something, racist
towards black people,

00:54:32.560 --> 00:54:34.250
did you tell the
person you were black?

00:54:34.250 --> 00:54:35.500
MAR JAYE: No.

00:54:35.500 --> 00:54:38.080
I didn't.

00:54:38.080 --> 00:54:41.490
Because he felt bad when
I actually was speaking

00:54:41.490 --> 00:54:44.280
in support of black people.

00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:47.080
So it took for him.

00:54:47.080 --> 00:54:49.280
He was like, oh
well, I guess maybe

00:54:49.280 --> 00:54:50.655
I didn't think of
it in that way.

00:54:50.655 --> 00:54:52.196
PAULA MADISON: So
you think you think

00:54:52.196 --> 00:54:54.446
it was more effective for
him to think you were white.

00:54:54.446 --> 00:54:56.612
MAR JAYE: Yeah I think it
was more effective for him

00:54:56.612 --> 00:54:58.040
to continue to
think I was white.

00:54:58.040 --> 00:55:00.862
And then my manager told me
to never talk to him again.

00:55:00.862 --> 00:55:01.710
[LAUGHING]

00:55:01.710 --> 00:55:02.310
PAULA MADISON: That's
tough when you're

00:55:02.310 --> 00:55:03.560
doing business with people.

00:55:03.560 --> 00:55:05.990
I mean sometimes, you
don't have that option.

00:55:05.990 --> 00:55:07.130
But I appreciate it.

00:55:07.130 --> 00:55:08.300
Well thank you very much.

00:55:08.300 --> 00:55:10.400
Thank you for that.

00:55:10.400 --> 00:55:12.580
So that actually was
the last question.

00:55:12.580 --> 00:55:17.890
I should tell you that, so
I'll be back there in a minute

00:55:17.890 --> 00:55:21.870
if you are interested in
the book, which is very

00:55:21.870 --> 00:55:23.340
multilayered and multifaceted.

00:55:23.340 --> 00:55:29.030
And by the way, at the very
end of it, we went to China

00:55:29.030 --> 00:55:32.830
and 300 of my grandfather's
direct descendants

00:55:32.830 --> 00:55:35.545
welcomed the 20 of us black
Chinese into the family.

00:55:40.800 --> 00:55:44.460
We have a long documented
legacy in my family

00:55:44.460 --> 00:55:45.710
on the Chinese side.

00:55:45.710 --> 00:55:50.090
I'm actually the 151st
generation of the Lowe clan.

00:55:50.090 --> 00:55:56.320
And my family's documented
history goes back to 1,006 B.C.

00:55:56.320 --> 00:56:01.450
And yet, on my
African Jamaican side,

00:56:01.450 --> 00:56:06.330
I can't find documents
past grandparents.

00:56:06.330 --> 00:56:08.220
But having said all
that, I would just

00:56:08.220 --> 00:56:10.470
like for you to understand,
that while I talked

00:56:10.470 --> 00:56:13.950
about my documented lineage,
my undocumented lineage

00:56:13.950 --> 00:56:15.590
goes back farther than that.

00:56:15.590 --> 00:56:19.240
Because the first man
and woman were African.

00:56:19.240 --> 00:56:21.950
In fact, so we all came
from that continent.

00:56:21.950 --> 00:56:25.450
So I just like to put into
perspective that while, oh yay,

00:56:25.450 --> 00:56:30.840
I can look up the people in
my family for many, many years

00:56:30.840 --> 00:56:38.140
back in our zupu, but the start
of mankind began in Africa.

00:56:38.140 --> 00:56:40.020
So with that, I
thank you very much.

00:56:40.020 --> 00:56:42.134
Thank you for having me.

00:56:42.134 --> 00:56:43.090
[APPLAUSE]

00:56:43.090 --> 00:56:46.069
And thank you, Laura,
for inviting me.

00:56:46.069 --> 00:56:47.110
My little intern grew up!

00:56:47.110 --> 00:56:48.660
Yay!
