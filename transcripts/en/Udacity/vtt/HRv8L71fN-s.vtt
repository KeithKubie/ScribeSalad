00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.219
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Let's look at some more y-intercepts. Here are two equations and here are two

00:00:04.219 --> 00:00:08.342
lines. This equation goes with the blue line and this equation goes with the

00:00:08.342 --> 00:00:12.562
yellow line. I want you to find the y-intercepts for each graph. You can list

00:00:12.562 --> 00:00:13.875
your coordinates here.
