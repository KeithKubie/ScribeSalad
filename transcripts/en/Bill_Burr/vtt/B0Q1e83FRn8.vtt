1
00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:02.650
Hey, what's going on?

2
00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:06.280
It's Bill Burr and It's time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

3
00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:11.140
June 12th, 2017. What's going on now? Why Ya? Um,

4
00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:13.570
and I know what you're thinking. Yeah. You're probably saying, hey,

5
00:00:13.571 --> 00:00:17.050
what do you mean is time for the Monday morning podcast bill? It's so late.

6
00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:21.850
What the fuck? Um, it's like this week.

7
00:00:21.851 --> 00:00:23.170
What a year. You're never late.

8
00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:26.620
He though he had gas show up in your wife's like,

9
00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:29.920
<v 2>no, we were waiting. Well, it's all right.</v>

10
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.410
<v 1>Called Dao. You know,</v>

11
00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:38.050
you want to look at her the way Vince spic man looked at that guy in the sports

12
00:00:38.051 --> 00:00:42.680
show and go, oh, fucking slap a piece of paper out of her hand.

13
00:00:42.681 --> 00:00:45.050
But you can't because all your relatives are there watching.

14
00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.030
So then you got to sit there and make excuses. Oh, the, uh,

15
00:00:50.031 --> 00:00:52.280
the street like down the street was busted.

16
00:00:52.281 --> 00:00:55.280
So it was just blanket red or blinking, you know, yellow.

17
00:00:55.281 --> 00:00:59.300
So it was real slow and there was water coming out of the sewers.

18
00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:05.050
And, uh, some guy, I can't believe it's some guy in a hang glider squared,

19
00:01:05.051 --> 00:01:06.860
a Canda God hand to God.

20
00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.390
He got blown off course and he, yeah, he landed on right,

21
00:01:11.391 --> 00:01:15.410
right on the side of the supermarket. Yeah. Hit the side of it.

22
00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:16.610
He went down in the boat.

23
00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.750
<v 2>Why can't you just admit you were late? Because you don't care about me.</v>

24
00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.060
<v 1>It's not that I don't care about you,</v>

25
00:01:24.061 --> 00:01:26.850
it's just I just don't give a shit about this.

26
00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.990
And I thought maybe if I showed up a little later than it'd be less minutes.

27
00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:32.830
I'd have to spend at this. Yeah.

28
00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:35.150
<v 2>Are you saying you don't like by relatives?</v>

29
00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.210
<v 1>Yes. No, I'm kidding. You know what I'm saying?</v>

30
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.920
Um, God forbid any of my relatives listen to this. I like all my relatives.

31
00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:47.990
I got lucky. I came from,

32
00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.500
I came from a cool family and I married into a cool family.

33
00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.460
You know what I mean? So there you go. Now I might just covering my bases.

34
00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:00.930
Nobody knows. Why can't I get the fucking Internet here? I don't, you know why?

35
00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.680
Cause I spend 9 million. I'm going to, I'm like this, do you know what I see?

36
00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.050
I still have cable, I have a dish, whatever.

37
00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.760
And I get all the packages and I know at this point you have these cord cutters.

38
00:02:13.761 --> 00:02:17.330
They just cut the cord and they there they saying Fuck Network TV,

39
00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.170
fuck 60 minutes, fuck all of that shit. Um,

40
00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:25.430
I guess it's all just gonna end up on the computer and just every TV show is

41
00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:30.200
gonna have an app or every network is going to have an app within the app will

42
00:02:30.201 --> 00:02:31.100
be all the shows.

43
00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:36.100
I'm sure that already exists cause I know there's HBO hot take or online or

44
00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:42.320
streaming now. Whatever the fuck it's called, summer slam, showtime,

45
00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.390
Summer Slam, whatever the fuck that call calling it.

46
00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:50.110
So I'm old school and the reason why I'm old schools now cause I'm down to earth

47
00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.130
man,

48
00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:57.220
it's because I do not want to waste one second of my fucking life trying to

49
00:02:58.791 --> 00:03:02.500
figure how the new shit works. All right.

50
00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:03.843
That's the reason

51
00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:09.160
I've always bought cars and I drive them for a decade.

52
00:03:09.161 --> 00:03:12.460
I just keep changing the fucking oil. That's what I do.

53
00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.670
The only reason why I went from the Prius to the Jag is just because my daughter

54
00:03:18.671 --> 00:03:21.130
was coming and I was just like,

55
00:03:21.131 --> 00:03:24.580
I bet buy a cool car before she gets here or I'm going to be fucked.

56
00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:29.380
And I never bought myself a cool car because I don't know,

57
00:03:29.381 --> 00:03:32.620
I've always been a frugal son of a bitch, you know,

58
00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:35.710
I didn't want that stupid fuck.

59
00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:39.550
You know when I was drive down the street with your whole fucking cool ass car

60
00:03:39.551 --> 00:03:40.900
and everybody turned around and looking at you,

61
00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:44.180
I like blending in the background, you know, leave me alone. Dive Bar,

62
00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:45.031
dive bar garden.

63
00:03:45.031 --> 00:03:50.031
I not VIP that down there at the fucking Sushi restaurant where all the fucking

64
00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.230
cons hang out with the cameras, you know,

65
00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:58.710
whatever that fucking show is. So anyways, you know I had,

66
00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:02.860
I had like a really bad cab driver back from lax.

67
00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:08.370
I take cabs cause I'm not downloading that fucking app onto my phone and then

68
00:04:09.461 --> 00:04:14.320
you track me and see where the fuck I am. Those Uber cuts. All right,

69
00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:19.390
fuck them. So yeah, I just take the taxi.

70
00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:23.530
So I get in the cab and we're driving egos. How do you want to go? I go,

71
00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:27.280
let's take the fucking highways, right? It's the middle of the day here.

72
00:04:27.281 --> 00:04:29.050
So you know, I always pick out the windows,

73
00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:33.520
we come into land to see what the old fluoro fizzy looks like. And um,

74
00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:36.280
so whatever we get on the goddamn thing.

75
00:04:36.281 --> 00:04:38.650
And I noticed the guys not in the Hov Lane, I'm like, buddy,

76
00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:41.740
there's two of us here we are the world we're saving.

77
00:04:41.741 --> 00:04:46.450
We're thinking locally and acting globally, right? This is green piece here.

78
00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:51.940
We have two people in a car. We get to use the diamond lane. And he's like,

79
00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:55.850
<v 3>oh no, I dog the,</v>

80
00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:00.800
<v 1>he didn't have the easy pass thing, whatever it is. And I'm like,</v>

81
00:05:00.801 --> 00:05:02.020
how come we don't have that? And he goes, well,

82
00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:05.180
it costs money and his accent costs money.

83
00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.750
What does your fucking job is driving people around you asshole.

84
00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:13.900
If you had that thing you could get people to and from where they're going and

85
00:05:14.121 --> 00:05:17.960
you could, you could pick up more people, right? You could make more money.

86
00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:23.930
So I'm in the back, you know, big Hollywood phony,

87
00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:27.530
getting all grumpy trial. Look at, look at, look at bill. Oh look at him.

88
00:05:27.531 --> 00:05:30.500
He's getting in a taxi cab. He didn't forget where he came from.

89
00:05:30.501 --> 00:05:31.580
Two seconds later,

90
00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:36.680
I'm fucking bitching out this fucking poor old baster

91
00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:40.100
in my own passive aggressive way.

92
00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:44.000
Just mumble in the backseat out of fucking out of the fucking day.

93
00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:45.980
This is what the fuck. I mean this is on May. Should I,

94
00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:48.530
he should have said that as you pulled up or whatever. Right.

95
00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:54.320
So then he just had no instincts. You know, we go to get off our exit, you know,

96
00:05:54.321 --> 00:05:58.130
onto another fucking highway. So there's long line

97
00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:02.750
<v 4>that all this shitheads weighed in and then there's Surrey Ray Ray Liotta light,</v>

98
00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:03.613
right?

99
00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:07.790
Fuck you pay me going in through the kitchen.

100
00:06:07.791 --> 00:06:10.700
People work nine to five. That was fish nooks, right?

101
00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:14.570
We didn't ask for anything we want wanted, we just, we just took it.

102
00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:20.120
And then when it was all said and done, your busted joint out, right?

103
00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:21.051
You take that fuck.

104
00:06:21.051 --> 00:06:24.230
You go around everybody like you still going straight in the last seconds you

105
00:06:24.231 --> 00:06:26.600
put on your right hand directional, you get in,

106
00:06:26.601 --> 00:06:30.680
somebody beeps at you who gives a shit and there you are. All right.

107
00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:34.670
Those are basic skills that a cab drivers should have.

108
00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:39.260
And he gets in to the fucking soccer mom line and I was just like,

109
00:06:39.261 --> 00:06:43.310
this guy is the worst. And I was just like, you know what? He's an old man.

110
00:06:43.311 --> 00:06:47.570
He drives a capital. Okay, who gives a fuck?

111
00:06:47.571 --> 00:06:50.870
So then I just said, you know what? Who gives a fuck? So then he goes,

112
00:06:50.871 --> 00:06:54.110
which way do you want me to go? Which highway? I go, does it even matter?

113
00:06:54.111 --> 00:06:57.470
At this point? It's like you're going to sit in the longest.

114
00:06:57.471 --> 00:06:59.270
I didn't say this part in and sit in the longest line.

115
00:06:59.271 --> 00:07:01.490
You don't have the fucking Hov thing. I mean

116
00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:07.670
you want to just pull over and get some lunch. Let me, I will fuck a Gonia.

117
00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:12.990
So anyways, we get up to that. My house, he goes, I pay paying,

118
00:07:12.991 --> 00:07:16.190
I say credit card. So he takes my credit card and he does the whole thing,

119
00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:19.520
reaching through the little fucking divider window there,

120
00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:23.720
and then he hits no tip and I go too wide. You hit no tip. He goes,

121
00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:27.230
he goes, Nah, I don't know that thing. He goes,

122
00:07:27.231 --> 00:07:31.460
I deserve to be punished. That's what he said. And I said, Jesus Christ,

123
00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:35.900
I'm not taking it to that level. I was upset half an hour.

124
00:07:35.901 --> 00:07:40.250
I'm going to fucking tip you. He goes, Nah, I don't deserve above a plan.

125
00:07:40.251 --> 00:07:43.580
I got off. Don't find them. Just made me sad. Don't ever say that.

126
00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:48.950
So an IBM 20 bucks cash and he's all fucking mean.

127
00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:53.030
I'll get you changed it, change you.

128
00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:56.600
When is this how you do it? Maybe that's his scam.

129
00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:58.940
He doesn't have the thing.

130
00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:02.290
And then in the end he fucking just puts his head down and goes, oh,

131
00:08:02.291 --> 00:08:06.470
I don't deserve a tip. And then a fucking soft. He goes, no, yes you do.

132
00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:08.240
And then he gets $20 tip.

133
00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:11.900
Even though he stuck at what he was doing and he still doesn't have to pay for

134
00:08:11.901 --> 00:08:14.840
the thing. I think, you know what? I think I got, I think I got a scamp.

135
00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:21.620
I think I fell for it. I think I bought, I bought a a, you know,

136
00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:25.070
a VCR and I open it up and it's just a brick in the box. Remember that one?

137
00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:28.070
That was the old scam back in the 80s. It kid,

138
00:08:28.071 --> 00:08:33.071
you want to VCR 50 bucks the fucking Hannity and you've run away with the box.

139
00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:35.990
You open it up. There was a brick and then

140
00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:43.400
brilliant, brilliant fucking scam. You know,

141
00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:46.340
cause even if they asked to open up the box, you know what's in there.

142
00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:48.740
So all you gotta do is as they go to open it,

143
00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:52.520
you just grab the brick before they do and you smash him over the head.

144
00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:56.250
Then you take everything in his wallet, sort

145
00:08:56.250 --> 00:09:00.690
<v 1>of fail sick, you know, unless the guy's bigger than you.</v>

146
00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:03.270
Then as he goes to open, he just go, cops, cops, cops,

147
00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:05.310
and you grabbed the box and you get the fuck out of the,

148
00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:09.810
I don't know what I'm talking about. So anyways, I had a great weekend. Um,

149
00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:12.750
I went up to the, uh,

150
00:09:13.830 --> 00:09:18.830
I went up to Montreal Morial with Sir Paul Versey and,

151
00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:23.170
uh, Andrew Feminists. And, uh,

152
00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:28.120
we did the Olympic theater on my birthday Saturday night and he probably wanted

153
00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:30.390
to, hey, bill, why did you, why would you do stand up on your birthday?

154
00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:34.860
It's cause I wanted to go to the Formula One Formula One race on June 11th.

155
00:09:34.861 --> 00:09:38.610
And when I booked it, I wasn't thinking June 10th is my birthday.

156
00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:44.190
I just saw June 11th. And that's not an important day to me. You know,

157
00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:45.631
that's how dumb I am.

158
00:09:45.631 --> 00:09:49.140
It didn't dawn on me that my birthday was the fucking day before. So anyways,

159
00:09:49.650 --> 00:09:54.450
I go up there and um, I go out, when Andrew brought me up,

160
00:09:54.451 --> 00:09:57.180
he goes, uh, keep it going for the birthday boy.

161
00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:01.680
And he brought me out and the crowd sang me happy birthday was awesome,

162
00:10:03.210 --> 00:10:04.200
had a fun show.

163
00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:09.330
I get off stage and I walked down to the green room and um,

164
00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:12.700
some people from Jess for were there and they had got me this,

165
00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.900
this unbelievable cured meat from someplace with bread.

166
00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:20.970
And they had all like the a, what's that Kid's movie? Um,

167
00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:26.790
you know, the car is talk, what does that, is it called cars?

168
00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:32.250
I Dunno, I don't, you know, I just, I'm new to the kid game, whatever.

169
00:10:32.251 --> 00:10:33.360
So they had those all up there.

170
00:10:33.361 --> 00:10:38.361
Like I was a five-year-old and then my lady had sent me up a bottle of Johnny

171
00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:43.710
Walker blue, which is funny cause I was trying to be Billy, no fun.

172
00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:46.320
And I was telling her how great I felt,

173
00:10:46.321 --> 00:10:49.450
not drinking and getting eight hours sleep and I'm talking about my birthday.

174
00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:52.080
And she goes, Hey Jada, have a couple tonight. You have a couple tonight.

175
00:10:52.081 --> 00:10:53.790
And I was like, yeah, why do you always do this to me?

176
00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:55.770
I'm trying to do the right thing.

177
00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:58.320
They're trying to go to bed early and you're always like, Bill,

178
00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:01.290
you're not an alcoholic. Stop being so dramatic. You know?

179
00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.280
And then I realized, oh it's cause she got me the journey of our complaints.

180
00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:08.160
I called her up and then she, you know, we had a good laugh about that.

181
00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:10.860
So I had a little shot of that before I did.

182
00:11:10.861 --> 00:11:15.861
The second show and then the second show at the end of that Versie in Jemilla's

183
00:11:16.770 --> 00:11:20.130
brought out a cake with candles on it and shit.

184
00:11:20.131 --> 00:11:24.930
And everyone was singing happy birthday again. It's a 1400 cedar.

185
00:11:24.931 --> 00:11:29.310
I had 2,800 people and people didn't like my act towards the end sing the happy

186
00:11:29.311 --> 00:11:33.630
birthday was one of the best parties I've ever had. So I'm an asshole.

187
00:11:33.631 --> 00:11:37.320
I go to blow out the candles and I go, I gotta make a wish.

188
00:11:37.321 --> 00:11:39.180
I gotta make a wish and I'm in Montreal. I go,

189
00:11:39.181 --> 00:11:44.040
I wish for a Bruin Stanley Cup championship next year. They're all like,

190
00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:47.210
<v 5>okay.</v>

191
00:11:47.210 --> 00:11:47.980
<v 1>Well it was funny though.</v>

192
00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:51.980
It was their reaction made me laugh when I blew out part of the candles without

193
00:11:51.981 --> 00:11:55.030
the rest of them. So I guess not winning next year, but a,

194
00:11:55.031 --> 00:11:59.230
I really want to thank everybody that came out. I had such a fucking great time,

195
00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:04.240
both shows and that really is one of the great cities,

196
00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:08.710
um, that I've ever been to. I love that place.

197
00:12:08.711 --> 00:12:12.340
I wish I had more time to spend there, but, um, you know,

198
00:12:12.341 --> 00:12:14.980
I kind of flew up and, uh,

199
00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:20.200
I was just tired from that whole week of hour running around running my yap

200
00:12:20.201 --> 00:12:20.981
promoting the show.

201
00:12:20.981 --> 00:12:23.500
So I just sorta went into the fetal position before the show.

202
00:12:23.501 --> 00:12:25.180
I didn't even get to walk around and see anything.

203
00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:28.660
Then I did the two shows and uh,

204
00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:31.390
then I went right back to bed,

205
00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:37.570
went right to bed and got eight hours sleep and then woke up and went to my

206
00:12:37.571 --> 00:12:39.610
first Formula One race,

207
00:12:40.390 --> 00:12:44.530
which I have to tell you lived up to the hype.

208
00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:47.523
<v 5>Um,</v>

209
00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:53.420
<v 1>I don't even know where to begin as far as like going out to just see seeing</v>

210
00:12:54.751 --> 00:12:57.800
this event that I don't even know what like a year and a half ago I,

211
00:12:57.801 --> 00:13:01.470
I sorta knew the sport existed. I mean, I knew about it, but I wasn't,

212
00:13:02.610 --> 00:13:06.030
you know, doing all this shit of be,

213
00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:09.420
we know watching every single race. So now to finally show up,

214
00:13:10.110 --> 00:13:12.600
you know what that going on was like a,

215
00:13:14.570 --> 00:13:16.660
I don't know how to explain it. Like the cars stems.

216
00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:21.390
Just seeing the cars alone was like seeing a celebrity to me, like all that.

217
00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:25.640
So Ferrari, that's, that's the fucking, that's number Sadie's team. Ah,

218
00:13:25.641 --> 00:13:29.480
there's the fuel shot, the four Sindia team, you know,

219
00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:35.240
it was incorrect. It was just an incredible experience. We get there, we,

220
00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:40.310
you know, we park, then you take a little boat over and um,

221
00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:44.350
I don't know. It was crazy. You know though,

222
00:13:44.370 --> 00:13:46.610
the guy who does all the wrap up shit, you know, the,

223
00:13:46.650 --> 00:13:50.390
the interviews and everything before and after a will bucks and he came out to

224
00:13:50.391 --> 00:13:53.690
the show, he was telling us she got to come down to the pit area,

225
00:13:53.691 --> 00:13:58.290
whatever the fuck they call it, the, uh, I forget what the fuck they call,

226
00:13:58.450 --> 00:14:03.450
but we had these sick ass passes and we had just under a Illuminati level seats,

227
00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:05.473
you know,

228
00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:09.470
every time you think you're in the best place you could watch and you find out

229
00:14:09.471 --> 00:14:14.471
there's another more air condition to area with even older manicured look at

230
00:14:16.401 --> 00:14:18.740
dudes with the younger, hotter looking chicks.

231
00:14:18.741 --> 00:14:21.500
Every time you think you're at the yet,

232
00:14:21.501 --> 00:14:26.450
the final level of Dante's inferno, there's another fucking level.

233
00:14:26.451 --> 00:14:30.680
It's incredible. You know, there was a hole,

234
00:14:30.681 --> 00:14:34.530
there was one other level above where the hell we were at. And uh,

235
00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:36.560
that's where the guys look like a,

236
00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:40.430
you know what Celine Dion's husband used to look like?

237
00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:43.850
You know that guy m he was a ball dude.

238
00:14:43.851 --> 00:14:46.520
He basically look like Rob Reiner,

239
00:14:47.090 --> 00:14:51.260
but he was the fucking shape shifts shift or like lizard level,

240
00:14:52.610 --> 00:14:55.070
you know, one of those guys that always dresses all in white,

241
00:14:55.220 --> 00:14:59.000
like he's a bald dude, but even like just the Shitty ad left on this side,

242
00:14:59.001 --> 00:15:01.490
you like, that's like a fucking thousand dollar haircut.

243
00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:05.600
His beard was like perfectly manicured. You know what I mean?

244
00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:08.570
Those guys, those guys who was like,

245
00:15:08.710 --> 00:15:11.660
their whole wardrobe is like linen and they take, yeah,

246
00:15:11.661 --> 00:15:13.970
they walk around like in Christ clothes.

247
00:15:18.370 --> 00:15:18.940
<v 0>Okay.</v>

248
00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:22.790
<v 1>They're always on the French Riviera. They're always in a fucking yacht.</v>

249
00:15:22.791 --> 00:15:27.370
They got private jets and then there's always some mere cat looking chick

250
00:15:27.371 --> 00:15:30.860
sitting next to them that's like fucking like, you know,

251
00:15:30.861 --> 00:15:34.700
2122 and you're like, oh my God,

252
00:15:35.930 --> 00:15:40.930
did you pull up and you're fucking world cups sailboat,

253
00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:47.210
you know, go into a town and just walk up to these broke people just, you know,

254
00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:48.140
genetic, you know,

255
00:15:48.141 --> 00:15:52.250
they hit the lottery genetics and had this beautiful girl and you just took her

256
00:15:52.251 --> 00:15:54.470
away, you know?

257
00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:57.770
Do you open toed fucking sandals?

258
00:15:59.450 --> 00:15:59.540
<v 6>Yeah,</v>

259
00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:02.810
<v 1>I remember that guy. Celine Dion's husband. I just remember he,</v>

260
00:16:02.811 --> 00:16:06.170
not only was he Barb, but his head was perfectly tan,

261
00:16:06.171 --> 00:16:07.370
so it didn't even look bad.

262
00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:12.260
And then he just had this angelic white hair on this side.

263
00:16:13.670 --> 00:16:15.950
Same thing with like the a his beard.

264
00:16:17.210 --> 00:16:17.580
<v 6>Okay.</v>

265
00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:21.180
<v 1>It was a different kind of white, you know, like the, you know,</v>

266
00:16:21.181 --> 00:16:23.430
like those fancy fucking paint you can get with.

267
00:16:23.431 --> 00:16:26.850
It's just a hint of another color in there. I don't know what was in there,

268
00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:28.800
but you can see why.

269
00:16:29.190 --> 00:16:34.020
So Celine was just so in love that she was punching herself in the fucking chest

270
00:16:34.021 --> 00:16:37.320
every night. Couldn't get wait to get back.

271
00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:39.060
<v 6>Okay.</v>

272
00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:39.421
<v 1>I mean,</v>

273
00:16:39.421 --> 00:16:43.840
if that's what is fucking hair and then side of his head and his beard looking

274
00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:48.390
at, can you imagine this guy's pubes I must see he had a leg up,

275
00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:50.130
<v 0>right?</v>

276
00:16:50.130 --> 00:16:53.670
<v 1>Perfectly Tan junk. You know what,</v>

277
00:16:53.671 --> 00:16:58.650
this fucking angelic winged pubes I can't even imagine that. That,

278
00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:00.540
yeah, we didn't get to that level.

279
00:17:01.230 --> 00:17:03.420
We got to the level where it was a bunch of people,

280
00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:05.730
like just fucking real race fans.

281
00:17:06.270 --> 00:17:09.640
We got to the level that we had a canopy and I still got a fucking sunburn.

282
00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:13.170
That's how white I am. You know, cause the sun wasn't on my head,

283
00:17:13.171 --> 00:17:17.580
but it hit my fucking chest. So got all fucking red and um,

284
00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:22.230
but I want to thank everybody at the f one race. Everyone was so fucking cool.

285
00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:27.180
So long story short, I got to make it funny man. I had such a good time.

286
00:17:27.570 --> 00:17:32.570
So we're sitting like if you watch a replay of the race when,

287
00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:37.950
right when the, they come out of the pit, you know, to rejoin the race,

288
00:17:37.951 --> 00:17:40.470
right? Where they hit the acceleration, you know,

289
00:17:40.471 --> 00:17:43.710
they gotta drive like fucking two and a half miles an hour and then they get to

290
00:17:43.711 --> 00:17:46.410
this point where they can fucking take off, right, right.

291
00:17:46.411 --> 00:17:50.220
Where they take off was where we were sitting and um,

292
00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:53.300
we could see turn one and then turn two and

293
00:17:54.030 --> 00:17:54.863
<v 5>um,</v>

294
00:17:55.460 --> 00:17:58.610
<v 1>it's a whole other game trying to watch the race.</v>

295
00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:00.953
<v 5>Um,</v>

296
00:18:01.250 --> 00:18:02.990
<v 1>when you're there, if you don't have like, I mean,</v>

297
00:18:03.530 --> 00:18:06.020
I wish I brought like a radio so I could have figured out what the fuck was

298
00:18:06.021 --> 00:18:09.230
going on because I didn't know what happened to Vettel.

299
00:18:09.830 --> 00:18:13.760
I didn't know that the red bull guy, you know, who was it? Uh,

300
00:18:13.790 --> 00:18:18.620
Max a Max Maximilian there, a max for stabbing. Right.

301
00:18:19.850 --> 00:18:22.310
He clipped the front of his car. I had no idea what was going.

302
00:18:22.311 --> 00:18:25.100
All I know is he pitted really early and I was like, what the fuck?

303
00:18:25.790 --> 00:18:29.750
And all of a sudden he went from second place to like 15th or last in the race.

304
00:18:29.870 --> 00:18:32.630
So I kind of knew, but I had no, I had no idea what happened.

305
00:18:32.930 --> 00:18:36.680
I didn't know that, that fucking, uh, what's his face there? Kimmy? Raking in.

306
00:18:36.681 --> 00:18:40.280
I didn't know that he had problems with his brakes. We had no fucking idea.

307
00:18:41.180 --> 00:18:42.620
No idea. Um,

308
00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:43.620
<v 5>okay.</v>

309
00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:47.460
<v 1>And uh, it was so fucking loud yet. Earplugs in and the guy's talking over,</v>

310
00:18:47.461 --> 00:18:52.120
but it's just so God damn loud. Um, I'm jumping all over the story of do,

311
00:18:52.121 --> 00:18:53.430
we took a little boat over,

312
00:18:53.431 --> 00:18:55.500
we parked in the garage and then you get in this little boat,

313
00:18:56.340 --> 00:19:01.340
takes you over there and then we'll hook this up down in the whole fucking

314
00:19:01.970 --> 00:19:05.450
whatever the fuck they call it because of the P and we got to look at the

315
00:19:05.451 --> 00:19:08.810
garages and all that shit in and we went into the red bull one.

316
00:19:09.710 --> 00:19:10.030
<v 5>Okay.</v>

317
00:19:10.030 --> 00:19:14.320
<v 1>In me, very busy and families got to meet, uh, Daniel Ricardo,</v>

318
00:19:14.321 --> 00:19:18.940
who I famously called a Rick, Ricky, Rick and in or some shit. Daniel, Ricardo,

319
00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:23.470
nicest fucking guy ever. And by the way,

320
00:19:23.471 --> 00:19:28.090
I want to be in the shape of an f one driver. This guy's a fucking ridiculous.

321
00:19:28.150 --> 00:19:32.410
This guy was like, uh, I dunno, he's like five 11. So he's got me by an inch,

322
00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:35.410
so he was probably 30 pounds lighter than me.

323
00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:41.020
It's fucking amazing. And he goes, yeah,

324
00:19:41.021 --> 00:19:43.540
we get weighed twice a day right before the, you know,

325
00:19:43.570 --> 00:19:48.570
during the race week or whatever it was joking about some fucking broccoli thing

326
00:19:48.791 --> 00:19:49.690
that drink.

327
00:19:49.691 --> 00:19:53.650
He just drank and how much weight they lose when they're in the car and all that

328
00:19:53.651 --> 00:19:57.430
type of stuff. Um, I really want to thank red bull racing, how far,

329
00:19:57.431 --> 00:20:00.390
how cool and nice they were and everything. Uh,

330
00:20:00.430 --> 00:20:03.520
they were kind of the exact opposite of this fucking count.

331
00:20:03.521 --> 00:20:05.410
We met from the Ferrari team.

332
00:20:05.710 --> 00:20:09.520
Granted it was after the race and I thought he was one of the guys was cool.

333
00:20:09.521 --> 00:20:12.590
He was really, really nice. But the first guy we met was a con,

334
00:20:12.790 --> 00:20:15.940
but I think he thought we will be in contact because I didn't understand.

335
00:20:16.900 --> 00:20:19.600
I knew that Ferrari was having a nightmare of a day,

336
00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:24.670
but I didn't realize the level. I mean, I thought it was so cool that, you know,

337
00:20:25.270 --> 00:20:27.070
Vito was able to work his way back up to the field.

338
00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:30.340
I was kind of paying attention to him. I wasn't paying attention to Kimmy.

339
00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:33.820
So when I went down there, I, you know, I didn't know what to say.

340
00:20:33.930 --> 00:20:34.930
The guy was like, after the race,

341
00:20:34.931 --> 00:20:37.900
all this Ferrari guys are like smoking cigarettes too. It's fucking hilarious.

342
00:20:37.930 --> 00:20:39.820
All tanned up fucking smoking cigarettes.

343
00:20:40.450 --> 00:20:42.210
And I just walked up and I was just like,

344
00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:43.190
<v 5>like a,</v>

345
00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:45.930
<v 1>I was just like, hey man, is it okay confers,</v>

346
00:20:45.931 --> 00:20:48.100
he gets a picture with you cause you wanted a picture with somebody from

347
00:20:48.101 --> 00:20:51.010
Ferrari, you know, he's half Sicilian, you know,

348
00:20:51.850 --> 00:20:55.170
so the guy's just leave. He's like, yeah, yeah. And I said, hey, you know,

349
00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:57.420
you know, good race today. You know, you, you guys,

350
00:20:57.421 --> 00:21:02.130
at least you got by the forced India guys and his face just dropped

351
00:21:03.190 --> 00:21:04.680
<v 6>and [inaudible]</v>

352
00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:06.950
<v 1>I swear to God in his face,</v>

353
00:21:07.010 --> 00:21:12.010
I understood the entire history and the pressure of working on Ferrari.

354
00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:17.150
Like he, he just looked at us. I can't even,

355
00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:21.810
he didn't say anything and then he just went, uh, I said, ugh.

356
00:21:21.870 --> 00:21:23.180
And I was trying to make it nice again. I was,

357
00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:26.100
I told Nate a good race when they had a terrific race.

358
00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:28.440
He probably thought he didn't know this was my first event,

359
00:21:28.441 --> 00:21:31.170
so he probably thought I was fuck with them. So he's probably not a cunt,

360
00:21:31.770 --> 00:21:34.050
but if you could have seen this guy's face, fucking drop it.

361
00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:37.170
I'll tell you if an actor ever did with this, guys faced it in a movie,

362
00:21:37.171 --> 00:21:40.410
you'd win an Oscar and now versus he's got to stand next to him and verse.

363
00:21:40.411 --> 00:21:43.050
He can read people better than me. You know, he's half Sicilian, half Greek.

364
00:21:43.051 --> 00:21:46.050
It's fucking over, right. So he feels uncomfortable.

365
00:21:46.051 --> 00:21:47.880
So I'm trying to make it nice going, like, all right,

366
00:21:47.881 --> 00:21:49.800
this is going to be a legendary picture, whatever.

367
00:21:50.250 --> 00:21:54.360
And then he goes on and he takes a picture and then the fucking, the guy,

368
00:21:54.490 --> 00:21:57.660
we thought it was a con, but probably thought we were a con. He goes, no,

369
00:21:57.661 --> 00:22:01.830
you just missed the legend. Go by Michael. He goes out Vettel that'll just walk,

370
00:22:02.190 --> 00:22:03.420
bike. We're like, really? Where do you go? He goes,

371
00:22:03.421 --> 00:22:05.580
I went right in there and we believed them.

372
00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:08.010
And then Andrew figured out later that he was just fucking with us.

373
00:22:10.810 --> 00:22:11.643
<v 6>Okay.</v>

374
00:22:11.810 --> 00:22:14.570
<v 1>Um, and then we met somebody else in the Fryer team, which, who's really nice,</v>

375
00:22:14.571 --> 00:22:19.060
but um, anyways, it was a, uh,

376
00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:24.050
it was just an amazing fucking time. I don't even know. I don't know.

377
00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:27.200
I don't know how to do it justice. It's too, it was too much to try to,

378
00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:29.650
<v 6>okay.</v>

379
00:22:29.650 --> 00:22:30.200
<v 1>Pull it all into,</v>

380
00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:33.110
I guess I started at the fucking middle and then went back to the beginning and

381
00:22:33.111 --> 00:22:34.490
then I went to the end of the fucking race.

382
00:22:34.700 --> 00:22:39.700
Just know in the end we were sitting outside of a Lewis Hamilton's garage,

383
00:22:41.180 --> 00:22:41.451
you know,

384
00:22:41.451 --> 00:22:45.740
after everybody left and there was all these fans there and they introduced the

385
00:22:45.741 --> 00:22:50.240
whole team. The crowd goes crazy, like racing's really big with the fence.

386
00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:53.270
Like they do all this extra stuff, they're great.

387
00:22:53.271 --> 00:22:57.800
So then they would chant Louis his name and Louis comes out again with another

388
00:22:57.801 --> 00:22:58.910
bottle of champagne.

389
00:22:58.911 --> 00:23:02.750
He sprays it on his team and then sort of whipped around in our direction.

390
00:23:02.751 --> 00:23:06.350
And we actually got hit with the champagne from Lewis Hamilton.

391
00:23:06.351 --> 00:23:07.670
That's how fucking close we were.

392
00:23:07.671 --> 00:23:12.140
So I don't know how to ever top that experience. But like I'd like to say again,

393
00:23:12.141 --> 00:23:14.450
thank you to everybody who, uh, you know,

394
00:23:14.990 --> 00:23:17.630
Bruce Hills and all those guys from just for last, for hooking us up.

395
00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:22.880
We had a great time and um, yeah, I don't know what to tell you,

396
00:23:22.881 --> 00:23:25.370
but I kind of realized just going through,

397
00:23:25.371 --> 00:23:28.100
talking to everybody in like the garages and Shit, just how

398
00:23:29.830 --> 00:23:32.080
it's like Mercedes won't give red bull,

399
00:23:32.110 --> 00:23:35.320
they try to buy an engine I guess from Mercedes and they're like, yeah,

400
00:23:35.321 --> 00:23:37.840
no we're not giving you that. Basically.

401
00:23:37.841 --> 00:23:39.970
Cause Daniel Ricardo's too good of a fucking driver.

402
00:23:39.971 --> 00:23:41.920
We don't need that competition. However,

403
00:23:41.921 --> 00:23:46.190
they will sell it to other fucking teams. Like I think force India,

404
00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:49.850
they gave them, but it's not the same Mercedes engine that they have.

405
00:23:51.050 --> 00:23:54.350
It's really fucking weird. Like it's like, all right,

406
00:23:54.351 --> 00:23:57.470
well we'll sell an engine to a team that we know we could beat so we can make

407
00:23:57.471 --> 00:23:59.240
the money and help pay for the fucking team,

408
00:23:59.390 --> 00:24:01.010
but we're not gonna give it to a good team.

409
00:24:02.050 --> 00:24:02.310
<v 0>Okay.</v>

410
00:24:02.310 --> 00:24:05.760
<v 1>But I don't get how like red bull when,</v>

411
00:24:06.390 --> 00:24:08.610
when what's his face? Uh,

412
00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:11.790
Vettel was driving for one like fucking three in a row.

413
00:24:11.791 --> 00:24:16.580
Four in a row and nobody could catch him. It's like, what?

414
00:24:16.581 --> 00:24:17.081
What, what,

415
00:24:17.081 --> 00:24:21.710
what the fuck happened to red bull's engine over the last four years? You know,

416
00:24:21.790 --> 00:24:22.070
I don't know.

417
00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:26.490
I got my fucking program here and I hope I'm not boring you guys to shit.

418
00:24:26.491 --> 00:24:30.180
I'm going to get off this quickly because I know that for me to start talking

419
00:24:30.181 --> 00:24:31.500
about driving for fucking 20,

420
00:24:31.501 --> 00:24:35.520
God damn well at that taxi one was a taxi was a nice mainstream story,

421
00:24:35.521 --> 00:24:40.350
wasn't it? Doesn't that count for anything? You fucking assholes? Um,

422
00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:43.380
no. If I look up the Mercedes team,

423
00:24:43.890 --> 00:24:48.210
they've only been around since, uh,

424
00:24:48.750 --> 00:24:50.900
2010. Now.

425
00:24:50.901 --> 00:24:55.320
I know Mercedes has been racing cars since the 1950s.

426
00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:58.440
Like I don't get out of the Ferrari team's been around since 1950.

427
00:24:59.190 --> 00:25:01.080
Is this like some AMG shit?

428
00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:04.110
I'm going to have to look up the history of these teams because I found it

429
00:25:04.111 --> 00:25:06.360
fascinating because after a while I was like, you know what?

430
00:25:06.361 --> 00:25:08.070
I'm not going to root for Mercedes and fucking,

431
00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:09.960
I'm not going to join this sport.

432
00:25:09.961 --> 00:25:14.480
And then drew for the fucking Yankees or red socks easy. Right.

433
00:25:14.481 --> 00:25:18.380
So I kind of like a, I like red bull and I like fucking, uh,

434
00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:23.340
force India just cause I had a great time when I did that Gig in Mumbai and the

435
00:25:23.390 --> 00:25:27.900
comedians over there will fucking hilarious breaking balls and stuff. But um,

436
00:25:28.950 --> 00:25:31.870
but then I saw the owner of the team or wherever the director is,

437
00:25:32.010 --> 00:25:36.610
it's just some fucking white dude for Cindia.

438
00:25:36.620 --> 00:25:41.620
Is there like a fucking Aziz looking dude anywhere in there that's fucking,

439
00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:42.913
you know,

440
00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:47.690
you figured with the name like that there's gotta be an Indian Dude,

441
00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:53.810
you know, I don't fucking know. Anyways,

442
00:25:55.100 --> 00:25:58.410
what am I talking about here? Um, so I had added yeah, every fucking time.

443
00:25:58.411 --> 00:26:00.420
How about that? I'll leave it at that. I'll leave it at that.

444
00:26:00.421 --> 00:26:04.710
And what's his face? Lewis Hamilton got 25 fucking points and uh,

445
00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:08.580
now he's only, what, like 12 behind, he was 25 behind.

446
00:26:09.090 --> 00:26:11.760
That was the one exciting thing was watching Vettel work his way through the

447
00:26:11.761 --> 00:26:16.740
field. Oh and I forgot to say all the fucking, the four Sandia guys,

448
00:26:17.190 --> 00:26:19.410
even if you're not into this sport, ah,

449
00:26:19.411 --> 00:26:22.410
they were going back and forth with one another, right?

450
00:26:22.411 --> 00:26:25.830
The young kid was trying to get through and the Perez guy wouldn't let him

451
00:26:25.831 --> 00:26:30.380
through, would not let him throw up, right. What's the other guy's name? Oh,

452
00:26:30.990 --> 00:26:33.300
[inaudible] wanted to get through and he wouldn't get them through.

453
00:26:33.450 --> 00:26:35.490
So while they were fighting with each other,

454
00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:39.270
right in fourth and fifth place a Vettel, you know,

455
00:26:39.271 --> 00:26:40.620
divide and conquer and conquered.

456
00:26:40.621 --> 00:26:45.240
Went by both of them in the last couple fucking laps and ended up getting into

457
00:26:45.241 --> 00:26:49.000
fourth place, which was fucking huge, you know,

458
00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:52.000
and in a way fucked over the Mercedes team, you know?

459
00:26:52.001 --> 00:26:53.440
And I bet they called them up and say, hey,

460
00:26:53.441 --> 00:26:57.400
next time you fucking few chicanx want one of our fucking engines.

461
00:26:57.790 --> 00:27:01.330
All right, we gave you one of our God damn engines. This is how you treat us.

462
00:27:01.331 --> 00:27:04.870
You blocked the god Damn Ferrari's. Okay.

463
00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:06.430
Get faster car out front.

464
00:27:08.530 --> 00:27:09.363
<v 0>Okay,</v>

465
00:27:09.710 --> 00:27:11.120
<v 1>the fuck are we doing here?</v>

466
00:27:13.030 --> 00:27:13.290
<v 0>Okay,</v>

467
00:27:13.290 --> 00:27:16.800
<v 1>I'll give you a fucking Volkswagen. Ngd You do that shit to me again. Right?</v>

468
00:27:17.090 --> 00:27:21.450
I get that must've happened somewhere along the line that that had to have

469
00:27:21.451 --> 00:27:25.950
happened. So, um, is the highest team,

470
00:27:25.951 --> 00:27:29.580
the American team. It's so fucking confusing.

471
00:27:29.581 --> 00:27:32.250
I'm sitting here looking at McLaren, Honda, McLaren to me,

472
00:27:32.251 --> 00:27:36.420
fucking worked on Mercedes and Honda used to dominate the sport.

473
00:27:36.630 --> 00:27:39.960
Now this poor bastard, every time he goes around the fucking lap, dude,

474
00:27:39.961 --> 00:27:44.220
it's like he's driving a hooptie that thing you shits the fucking bed every time

475
00:27:44.580 --> 00:27:49.420
he took a fucking race off one, the one of those guys, Fernando Alonso,

476
00:27:49.421 --> 00:27:50.920
I think you said, you know, fuck this, I'm going to go,

477
00:27:50.921 --> 00:27:52.150
I'm going to take a race off.

478
00:27:52.151 --> 00:27:55.750
That's how bad your engines are and I'm going to go drive the indie 500.

479
00:27:55.930 --> 00:27:58.960
And I believe when he went there, his cause engine quit too. I'm not sure.

480
00:27:59.260 --> 00:28:02.560
I've been flying all over to hell. All over the hell. All over hill.

481
00:28:02.770 --> 00:28:04.840
So we went to the race, I got sunburned.

482
00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:08.260
We saw all of this stuff do what we were sitting and we literally saw them pull

483
00:28:08.261 --> 00:28:11.940
their cars in in the end where it was both Mercedes,

484
00:28:13.290 --> 00:28:17.370
um, Hamilton and botox and then, um, Daniel Ricardo,

485
00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:21.180
we saw them all shake hands. They walked up the stairs and then we saw them,

486
00:28:21.210 --> 00:28:25.170
you know, on the podium we would like to the side, you know,

487
00:28:25.590 --> 00:28:26.550
by the way,

488
00:28:27.220 --> 00:28:27.460
<v 0>okay.</v>

489
00:28:27.460 --> 00:28:31.150
<v 1>That fucking trophy that you get for winning that race,</v>

490
00:28:31.151 --> 00:28:33.070
Jesus Christ and that,

491
00:28:33.130 --> 00:28:36.910
that just one of the worst fucking trophies I've ever seen in my life.

492
00:28:38.380 --> 00:28:38.570
<v 0>Okay.</v>

493
00:28:38.570 --> 00:28:43.370
<v 1>I think it's just the, the Toronto that the Toronto, the Canadian Maple Leaf,</v>

494
00:28:44.420 --> 00:28:46.580
they just sort of have it elevated with all this stuff,

495
00:28:46.581 --> 00:28:48.170
but it's just such a blend.

496
00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:54.520
They should make it like gold or something with, with the red outline of Canada,

497
00:28:54.521 --> 00:28:55.354
you know what I mean?

498
00:28:55.590 --> 00:28:56.423
<v 0>Okay.</v>

499
00:28:57.600 --> 00:29:00.180
<v 1>Red and white for Canada and then you put a bunch of gold in there.</v>

500
00:29:00.181 --> 00:29:04.210
You shine it up a little bit. Jesus Christ candidate,

501
00:29:04.230 --> 00:29:06.620
all your imagination going into the Stanley Cup. I don't know.

502
00:29:06.621 --> 00:29:07.810
I was really disappointed with it.

503
00:29:07.811 --> 00:29:11.630
You know what's funny was the one that Lewis Hamilton, God was bad enough,

504
00:29:11.660 --> 00:29:13.970
the one that Daniel Ricardo get, I swear to God,

505
00:29:13.971 --> 00:29:16.910
he's probably using the proper open some door in his house.

506
00:29:17.420 --> 00:29:19.970
That's how bad I gotta look this thing up. I really have to,

507
00:29:19.971 --> 00:29:24.740
I gotta trash this fucking thing. Fuck is it?

508
00:29:24.741 --> 00:29:28.880
Come on bill. Can you believe that cab driver? I deserve to be punished.

509
00:29:28.881 --> 00:29:30.080
I mean that's the kind of mindset,

510
00:29:30.081 --> 00:29:33.200
that's how I ended up driving a fucking cabinets. 70 years of age

511
00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:36.220
and he's probably an immigrant.

512
00:29:36.340 --> 00:29:38.890
People are fucking racist and they probably never get an opportunity.

513
00:29:38.950 --> 00:29:42.130
I mean that's another thing, but that's, that's, that can happen to, you know.

514
00:29:42.590 --> 00:29:47.200
<v 4>All right, fair enough. Hey, fair enough. You know, who knows? Alright.</v>

515
00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:50.210
Montreal can I can,

516
00:29:50.211 --> 00:29:55.180
I can add a candidate Grand Prix,

517
00:29:55.181 --> 00:29:56.920
you know who's enjoying? Um,

518
00:29:57.810 --> 00:29:58.150
<v 5>okay.</v>

519
00:29:58.150 --> 00:30:01.690
<v 4>Me Talking about this right now is, is Nashville Predator fence?</v>

520
00:30:03.580 --> 00:30:05.680
Cause the last thing, oh, maybe it looks a little bit bit,

521
00:30:05.681 --> 00:30:09.220
it's got some fucking, it's got a little gold in there.

522
00:30:11.130 --> 00:30:11.560
<v 5>Okay.</v>

523
00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:15.820
<v 4>Yeah, it's just sitting on like rebar. It just, just no imagination.</v>

524
00:30:18.690 --> 00:30:21.340
Let me, could you please put like a red outline around the gold?

525
00:30:21.460 --> 00:30:23.800
Could you do something to fucking dress this up?

526
00:30:26.220 --> 00:30:27.053
<v 5>Um,</v>

527
00:30:28.150 --> 00:30:31.750
<v 4>I swear to God if there's some fucked up reason I ever won that race,</v>

528
00:30:31.751 --> 00:30:34.530
I don't know. I got so into this game, this,

529
00:30:34.540 --> 00:30:38.980
this fucking sport and I somehow lost 90 pounds so I could actually not be, uh,

530
00:30:39.460 --> 00:30:41.800
you know, causing the car to lose.

531
00:30:42.070 --> 00:30:45.040
And I somehow beat Lewis Hamilton in federal,

532
00:30:45.130 --> 00:30:47.980
in a non Mercedes non Ferrari engine car.

533
00:30:48.850 --> 00:30:50.950
If they brought that trophy out to me, you know,

534
00:30:50.951 --> 00:30:55.630
and I just lost fucking five pounds pissing myself as I'm driving around the

535
00:30:56.140 --> 00:30:58.780
damn track. I would, I just would be like, yeah, you keep that thing,

536
00:30:59.530 --> 00:31:00.011
you keep it.

537
00:31:00.011 --> 00:31:03.580
Why don't you go back and finish making that trophy and then I'll accept it.

538
00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:11.020
I'm sure that wouldn't cause any, uh, any international incident.

539
00:31:11.620 --> 00:31:14.590
Speaking of an international incident, what the fuck?

540
00:31:15.670 --> 00:31:18.730
The Nashville predators, all the dreaded,

541
00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:23.710
I lost sight of the puck and blew the whistle. Welcome Nashville Predator.

542
00:31:23.830 --> 00:31:26.260
Have fans welcome.

543
00:31:26.350 --> 00:31:31.350
You guys are now officially been baptized as hockey fans.

544
00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:37.720
Okay. Up until now. You were expansion, expansion,

545
00:31:38.620 --> 00:31:42.760
hockey fans. I didn't respect you. Even with your chance,

546
00:31:42.970 --> 00:31:45.880
even with Mashville even know how far you've come.

547
00:31:46.030 --> 00:31:51.030
I could not fully accept you as fans of the National Hockey League until I saw

548
00:31:53.380 --> 00:31:57.970
your team in a Stanley Cup final score, a goal,

549
00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:01.870
but the ref lost sight of the puck and it's waived off.

550
00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:06.790
Now you've earned your stripes. Now you have a rough day. You hate.

551
00:32:07.150 --> 00:32:09.250
You know now you got someone.

552
00:32:09.251 --> 00:32:12.740
People are gonna send letters to and fucking make death threats and all the

553
00:32:12.910 --> 00:32:14.470
other people take it too fucking seriously.

554
00:32:14.740 --> 00:32:16.660
Can you imagine that poor fucking referee?

555
00:32:17.170 --> 00:32:21.280
Listen to that Nashville Predator fan somehow figuring out his phone,

556
00:32:21.281 --> 00:32:24.100
phone number. Yeah, buddy. Let me tell you what,

557
00:32:24.310 --> 00:32:28.300
you fucking French mother fucker fired a kid. She would tear. See again,

558
00:32:28.301 --> 00:32:30.520
I swear to God, I swear to God,

559
00:32:32.110 --> 00:32:35.200
I swear to God buddy. I got some farmer and equipment.

560
00:32:35.201 --> 00:32:40.201
I'll figure out how to unrest it just to run you over with that after I shoot

561
00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:43.850
<v 1>you the fucking face. I can't imagine the threats that he's getting,</v>

562
00:32:44.990 --> 00:32:48.320
like I shouldn't even talk about it. That's probably not even funny. I'm

563
00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:53.690
unbelievable on fucking believable. But I told you guys,

564
00:32:53.691 --> 00:32:57.610
I fucking told you I picked the penguins. I can think of have, I dunno,

565
00:32:57.620 --> 00:32:59.720
somewhere around the first rounds, I know all these guys. Look,

566
00:32:59.721 --> 00:33:02.690
I don't see anybody stopping it. I just didn't see anybody.

567
00:33:03.110 --> 00:33:06.080
That's why I know after once the Blackhawks got knocked out, I was just like,

568
00:33:06.081 --> 00:33:09.830
yeah, fuck that silver. They gonna win. And then I lost faith with him.

569
00:33:09.950 --> 00:33:12.170
You know what their goal tending towards the end of the auto series.

570
00:33:12.171 --> 00:33:14.690
And they proved me wrong. And then there was that game.

571
00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:18.230
There was that game game for that, the predators one.

572
00:33:18.470 --> 00:33:22.400
But that fucking look on Crosby's face when he scored that goal and he didn't

573
00:33:22.401 --> 00:33:27.080
put his hands up. Like I scored a goal, he put 'em out to the side,

574
00:33:27.170 --> 00:33:30.260
you know, gathering his fucking teammates and like,

575
00:33:30.261 --> 00:33:35.261
that's one like total fucking business look on his face.

576
00:33:35.420 --> 00:33:39.860
And um, congratulations to the penguins.

577
00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:44.660
You fucking non-flying dirty birds. You did it again.

578
00:33:44.810 --> 00:33:48.700
That's Crosby's third, that's Malkin start.

579
00:33:48.710 --> 00:33:53.710
They now have one more than the fucking great duo of Mario Lemieux and Jaromir

580
00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:58.320
Yaga. So that's, that's really saying something. And they got five [inaudible].

581
00:33:58.840 --> 00:33:58.970
<v 0>Okay.</v>

582
00:33:58.970 --> 00:34:03.130
<v 1>They got fucking five. You know,</v>

583
00:34:03.131 --> 00:34:04.360
I don't want to start anything,

584
00:34:04.361 --> 00:34:07.960
but they almost have twice as many as the fucking fly.

585
00:34:10.170 --> 00:34:14.280
Twice as many as the flies. Philadelphia, you're going to sit there,

586
00:34:15.610 --> 00:34:18.810
you're going to take that shit. You're going to have to, during the off season.

587
00:34:18.830 --> 00:34:23.710
Same Way. Same Way I do as a Bruin fan. I believe we have six Stanley Cups,

588
00:34:24.460 --> 00:34:28.690
but we've been around since like a Charles Lindbergh. So that's different.

589
00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:33.460
Although the penguins have been around for 50 years already, just like that.

590
00:34:33.610 --> 00:34:38.380
Who would have thought? Um, anyways, let's talk about old Billy.

591
00:34:38.381 --> 00:34:42.970
No Fun. No Fun, Billy. What's the deal? No Fun,

592
00:34:42.971 --> 00:34:44.920
Billy. Um,

593
00:34:45.940 --> 00:34:49.030
so after telling you I was going to have no fun, um, you know,

594
00:34:49.031 --> 00:34:53.890
it was my birthday. I was in Montreal, but even then I didn't go fucking nuts.

595
00:34:54.220 --> 00:34:59.220
Like the last night we went to my favorite cigar bar up in Montreal.

596
00:34:59.261 --> 00:35:02.260
We went to stogies and um,

597
00:35:03.470 --> 00:35:06.890
I had a couple of fucking gray goose, even though I like Belvedere,

598
00:35:07.730 --> 00:35:12.470
grey goose is the Pepsi of, of Vodka,

599
00:35:12.530 --> 00:35:16.370
you know what I mean? I always like coke is code. Had the bite, you know,

600
00:35:16.371 --> 00:35:19.010
give you a fucking right different, you know.

601
00:35:19.980 --> 00:35:20.540
<v 0>Okay.</v>

602
00:35:20.540 --> 00:35:22.280
<v 1>Oh, speaking of that, what about Code Lotion?</v>

603
00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:26.510
Code Lotion of the week would have to be, they,

604
00:35:26.930 --> 00:35:31.130
the Nashville predators scored a legal goal and the guy lost the fucking side of

605
00:35:31.131 --> 00:35:32.780
the park. That is, that is,

606
00:35:34.230 --> 00:35:37.620
that is NHL referee code right there.

607
00:35:39.510 --> 00:35:42.150
That's exactly what the fuck that was. But um, yeah,

608
00:35:42.270 --> 00:35:45.450
so I'm not a big grey goose fan. Um,

609
00:35:45.980 --> 00:35:46.290
<v 6>yeah.</v>

610
00:35:46.290 --> 00:35:47.430
<v 1>You know, I feel like,</v>

611
00:35:47.431 --> 00:35:50.100
and I'm much like that cab driver that feels like he should be punished.

612
00:35:50.580 --> 00:35:53.970
I feel like when I'm drinking that I should be feeling the effects of what I'm

613
00:35:53.971 --> 00:35:57.810
doing to my body. I didn't want to watered down. You've got to drink the gas.

614
00:35:57.870 --> 00:36:01.250
You know, I like Belvedere. It's got a little more of a kick to it. Uh,

615
00:36:01.290 --> 00:36:03.570
although I'm not a big vodka guy, so I had that.

616
00:36:03.571 --> 00:36:07.440
I fucking smoked a cigar after the race. 10 30. Oh,

617
00:36:07.441 --> 00:36:10.470
freckles was in bed. Okay.

618
00:36:10.471 --> 00:36:15.330
So when my alarm went off it five 30 in the morning from my early flight to get

619
00:36:15.331 --> 00:36:19.740
back to my lovely wife and daughter, um, I was fine.

620
00:36:20.970 --> 00:36:25.080
I was packed, I was ready to fucking go. Everything was fine.

621
00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:26.730
And um,

622
00:36:27.330 --> 00:36:28.040
<v 6>okay.</v>

623
00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:32.460
<v 1>But now it's official. Now back in, it's just like a, uh,</v>

624
00:36:32.510 --> 00:36:36.680
my big thing this year as a 49 year old is eight hours sleep.

625
00:36:37.100 --> 00:36:39.200
I got to do it. I gotta do it.

626
00:36:39.350 --> 00:36:42.290
Cause as much as I like going out and partying and doing all that Shit,

627
00:36:42.650 --> 00:36:46.280
nothing at my age feels better than fucking eight hours sleep.

628
00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:51.880
So I'm hoping that I can latch onto this lifestyle and have that be my new

629
00:36:52.821 --> 00:36:57.050
fucking drug. Eight hours sleep.

630
00:36:58.190 --> 00:36:58.640
Um,

631
00:36:58.640 --> 00:36:59.473
<v 6>wow.</v>

632
00:36:59.950 --> 00:37:02.350
<v 1>Yeah, I got to do it. I don't know how to drink recreationally.</v>

633
00:37:02.351 --> 00:37:05.470
I gotta be honest with you. I just don't, you know.

634
00:37:06.280 --> 00:37:06.530
<v 6>Okay.</v>

635
00:37:06.530 --> 00:37:08.510
<v 1>I just, if I'm doing it, I'm fucking doing it.</v>

636
00:37:08.511 --> 00:37:10.040
It's like I got into F1 now look at me.

637
00:37:10.041 --> 00:37:13.000
I'm spending half the fucking podcast probably driving you guys up to Goddamn

638
00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:17.630
wall talking about this shit. And now, you know, I went to my first race,

639
00:37:17.631 --> 00:37:20.300
I'm going to the one in Austin and then immediately I just go,

640
00:37:20.301 --> 00:37:21.740
well that's theirs. That's two down,

641
00:37:21.860 --> 00:37:24.980
two down on the 20th I do two a year and 10 years I can fucking go to all of

642
00:37:24.981 --> 00:37:29.480
them. You know, sometimes that works for me. Sometimes it doesn't, you know,

643
00:37:29.481 --> 00:37:32.570
it works for me as far as like trying to succeed in life cause I just get into

644
00:37:32.571 --> 00:37:34.610
something and I fucking do it. And next thing you know,

645
00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:36.800
I crossed the finish line.

646
00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:41.630
But you know when you apply that same sort of philosophy to uh,

647
00:37:41.750 --> 00:37:43.340
drinking it, it doesn't work.

648
00:37:45.020 --> 00:37:47.180
It's all about after you have the drink,

649
00:37:47.181 --> 00:37:51.470
if you have the water afterwards and you sorta so be yourself back up again.

650
00:37:52.100 --> 00:37:56.770
I don't know. I don't think I'm cut out for it. So I need to take,

651
00:37:57.160 --> 00:38:00.040
I need, I've been needing to take time off for a good fucking year.

652
00:38:01.030 --> 00:38:02.380
So that's what I'm doing right now.

653
00:38:02.410 --> 00:38:05.470
I'm not saying I'm not going to drink for a fucking year, but I'm definitely a,

654
00:38:07.300 --> 00:38:10.120
I don't know. We'll see. Be Funny if I end up in AA,

655
00:38:11.260 --> 00:38:12.093
<v 6>you know,</v>

656
00:38:13.270 --> 00:38:18.230
<v 1>going to some fucking meeting. I'll never admit that I'm an alcoholic. Just got,</v>

657
00:38:18.330 --> 00:38:21.100
I'm going to go down and listen to those fucking stories, you know,

658
00:38:21.130 --> 00:38:22.600
send me the stories. The stories are funny.

659
00:38:22.601 --> 00:38:26.010
But then afterwards he's fucking chain smoking, doughnut eating, sad sex. I,

660
00:38:26.050 --> 00:38:28.870
you know, I remember when I got busted for drinking and driving, one of the,

661
00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:31.850
one of the crime ones, I had to go to two AA meetings.

662
00:38:31.851 --> 00:38:35.830
I had to go to a mothers against drunk driving meeting and all this community I

663
00:38:35.831 --> 00:38:39.460
had to do. And um, I remember going to the fucking,

664
00:38:41.210 --> 00:38:43.790
oh, the fucking a meaning

665
00:38:45.500 --> 00:38:46.580
Jesus Christ.

666
00:38:47.390 --> 00:38:50.120
<v 4>Just when you know, if you think you have an alcohol problem,</v>

667
00:38:50.121 --> 00:38:54.110
go to an AA meeting. Good Lord. These fucking people.

668
00:38:54.111 --> 00:38:58.610
Holy Shit. Insane the fucking stories.

669
00:38:59.450 --> 00:39:01.010
Waking up with no teeth.

670
00:39:01.910 --> 00:39:06.530
Get bailed out of jail and fucking walking out with no shoes right across the

671
00:39:06.531 --> 00:39:07.550
street to a liquor store.

672
00:39:07.650 --> 00:39:11.680
<v 1>Yeah. I mean, I don't know.</v>

673
00:39:11.681 --> 00:39:13.020
Maybe that's like an extreme version.

674
00:39:13.040 --> 00:39:14.870
<v 4>I don't fucking know. Where's a lots of this?</v>

675
00:39:14.930 --> 00:39:19.550
Let's read a little bit of advertising here for this week everybody. Huh? Uh,

676
00:39:20.430 --> 00:39:23.040
<v 1>where the hell is it? Where is it? Oh God,</v>

677
00:39:23.041 --> 00:39:25.260
somebody's going to correct me on Kryptonite this week.

678
00:39:26.370 --> 00:39:26.740
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

679
00:39:26.740 --> 00:39:28.510
<v 4>you guys just don't fucking let up. Do you?</v>

680
00:39:29.430 --> 00:39:30.263
<v 0>Okay.</v>

681
00:39:31.070 --> 00:39:34.280
<v 1>Unreal. Last week quoted I guess the fucking super hero people,</v>

682
00:39:34.281 --> 00:39:37.070
they take it so God damn, seriously. All right.

683
00:39:37.071 --> 00:39:39.410
I have advertising if this thing ever loads.

684
00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:43.890
<v 4>Come on, load it up. I never even finished talking about the cable shit.</v>

685
00:39:44.100 --> 00:39:45.180
I watched, you know,

686
00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:50.670
I pay so much fucking money for the Internet and I pay so much fucking money for

687
00:39:50.671 --> 00:39:51.780
cable and this shit doesn't work.

688
00:39:51.781 --> 00:39:54.290
You know that the f one race didn't even record.

689
00:39:56.560 --> 00:39:59.850
It started to record and it was just that shaking commercial that you can't fast

690
00:39:59.851 --> 00:40:03.810
forward past because I wanted to see what happened at the beginning of the race

691
00:40:03.811 --> 00:40:06.030
and then you know what? I went online and just found it.

692
00:40:07.050 --> 00:40:12.000
So maybe that's what I need to do to do to do. I have no idea. Um, oh,

693
00:40:12.001 --> 00:40:16.560
and I didn't even bring up the fucking Cavaliers. Holy Shit.

694
00:40:16.561 --> 00:40:21.240
What a game. What a fucking game. 48 first quarter points.

695
00:40:21.300 --> 00:40:24.330
86 points in the first half.

696
00:40:25.470 --> 00:40:28.710
Unfucking believable and it was still,

697
00:40:28.711 --> 00:40:30.570
it took them halfway through the fourth quarter.

698
00:40:31.810 --> 00:40:34.480
That's how little competition there is. But you know something,

699
00:40:34.810 --> 00:40:36.790
I think when that little fucking fellow there,

700
00:40:36.920 --> 00:40:39.550
the guy shoots the three pointers, he's probably a foot taller than me,

701
00:40:39.551 --> 00:40:43.390
but he looks like a little fellow on the NBA court when he fucking pretended to

702
00:40:43.391 --> 00:40:44.500
take a shit.

703
00:40:46.070 --> 00:40:48.650
That was one of the most classless things I've ever seen.

704
00:40:49.070 --> 00:40:53.090
He pretends to take a shit and then runs up to court,

705
00:40:53.091 --> 00:40:57.440
wipes his ass, and then wipes it on the cavalier logo. And then afterwards,

706
00:40:57.441 --> 00:41:00.890
like, yeah, I was in the moment. I don't remember what I did.

707
00:41:00.891 --> 00:41:04.790
Get the fuck Outta here. Get the fuck Outta here.

708
00:41:04.910 --> 00:41:06.980
You don't remember what you do. You know exactly what you did.

709
00:41:07.010 --> 00:41:09.680
Your fucking mind shitting on the floor.

710
00:41:12.290 --> 00:41:14.120
I Dunno why, you know, I gotta hit pause.

711
00:41:14.121 --> 00:41:16.010
I gotta hit pause to get the open this fucking thing.

712
00:41:17.230 --> 00:41:17.810
<v 0>Okay.</v>

713
00:41:17.810 --> 00:41:21.080
<v 1>All right. I'm back. I'm back. Just went out the kitchen.</v>

714
00:41:21.180 --> 00:41:26.040
It's just saw my dinner. Salmon Salad with salmon.

715
00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:29.190
Oh God. Fucking salmon.

716
00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:32.940
It was a tragedy about salmon is how many salmon get killed a year.

717
00:41:33.150 --> 00:41:34.370
It people don't even appreciate

718
00:41:34.370 --> 00:41:35.203
<v 4>it.</v>

719
00:41:35.470 --> 00:41:36.303
<v 5>You know,</v>

720
00:41:36.520 --> 00:41:39.550
<v 4>it's like tuna minus the personality. It's just like a fucking,</v>

721
00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:43.480
I was joking with Keith Robinson about that. We went out to dinners,

722
00:41:43.810 --> 00:41:48.230
you know the fish option one was just salmon and he's just like, yeah,

723
00:41:48.460 --> 00:41:53.230
Jesus Christ. And it's like, yes, salmon is salmon is a fucking Middle Act.

724
00:41:54.300 --> 00:41:55.133
<v 5>You know,</v>

725
00:41:55.520 --> 00:41:58.970
<v 4>it's a fucking terminal feature of the fishing world. All right,</v>

W I n C whiskey, India, November. Charlie,

811
00:47:00.410 --> 00:47:04.530
when you have a great glass of wine, it enhances the moment.

812
00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:08.670
Uh, you know what? You can't get drunk off of wine. Jesus Christ.

813
00:47:08.671 --> 00:47:10.080
That's what they had at the Formula One.

814
00:47:10.081 --> 00:47:12.150
They had Heinekens and then they had white wine.

815
00:47:12.180 --> 00:47:14.580
I drank lives like I don't wanna get all fucking beer fat.

816
00:47:14.581 --> 00:47:17.460
So I drank like two white wines and you know,

817
00:47:18.720 --> 00:47:22.190
I now understand why so women are so many women that [inaudible] and to this it

818
00:47:22.191 --> 00:47:26.310
possible to drink that shit and get any sort of a, a nice buzz.

819
00:47:27.510 --> 00:47:31.150
You know, it's just another thing that's harder for women. You know,

820
00:47:32.440 --> 00:47:36.520
you have no idea how difficult things are for us. Somebody write an article,

821
00:47:37.450 --> 00:47:38.470
um, okay.

822
00:47:38.500 --> 00:47:43.120
Whether you're reflecting on the day or with someone you love when you have a

823
00:47:43.121 --> 00:47:47.650
great glass of wine, it intenses the moment. Wink understands this.

824
00:47:47.710 --> 00:47:52.710
It's why they started their company to give you access to exceptional wines from

825
00:47:53.411 --> 00:47:58.210
around the world. So you can have more of those moments. You know what?

826
00:47:58.211 --> 00:48:01.450
I like a fucking Barolo. If you don't know shit about wine,

827
00:48:01.900 --> 00:48:06.490
go to wink and get a Barolo. Get one that's a little fruity.

828
00:48:06.820 --> 00:48:10.810
If that's the one I like and don't like those acidic once, um,

829
00:48:11.260 --> 00:48:12.011
that's a nice one.

830
00:48:12.011 --> 00:48:15.070
And then there's one that's sort of off the same vine begins with an N.

831
00:48:15.970 --> 00:48:20.280

838
00:48:39.700 --> 00:48:40.900
because it's a very intimidating thing.

839
00:48:40.901 --> 00:48:44.260
I found that Barolo and I've stuck with that ever since then.

840
00:48:44.261 --> 00:48:46.660

00:51:21.410 --> 00:51:26.240
You type in Burr that stamps.com enter bar. Ah,

883
00:51:26.270 --> 00:51:31.220
right. So the cavs are playing tonight. Oh my God. Oh my God.

884
00:51:31.221 --> 00:51:33.350
Dude. Can you imagine if they fucking win this one?

885
00:51:34.910 --> 00:51:38.000
Then they going back to Cleveland. This is how quickly it can turn around.

886
00:51:38.930 --> 00:51:43.610
This is how fast it can fucking turn around. It would be amazing.

887
00:51:43.640 --> 00:51:48.230
I have no, I haven't enjoyed a fucking game in a long time like that. Um,

888
00:51:48.860 --> 00:51:53.660
I was at a bar, of course. Who's kidding? Who? I haven't met Billy. No Fun.

889
00:51:53.810 --> 00:51:57.080
I'd been Billy. Less fun today. Am I start Billy? No Fun.

890
00:51:58.200 --> 00:51:59.440
<v 5>MMM. [inaudible]</v>

891
00:52:00.160 --> 00:52:05.160
<v 1>it's just the Cavaliers have to do what they did the other night again tonight,</v>

892
00:52:06.940 --> 00:52:10.080
you know, and then again, and then again. Uh,

893
00:52:10.120 --> 00:52:13.540
but each game I think would be less. And then the, you know,

894
00:52:13.600 --> 00:52:17.380
do you realize that the Cavaliers come back and do this?

895
00:52:17.381 --> 00:52:21.040
They'd be the first NBA team to ever do it. And then secondly,

896
00:52:22.190 --> 00:52:26.490
<v 4>Steph curry taking a shot, miming taking his shit, wiping his ass.</v>

897
00:52:26.590 --> 00:52:29.570
And like does that one of the most classless fucking things you've ever seen in

898
00:52:29.571 --> 00:52:32.870
your life? It's like fucking how that guy's a dad.

899
00:52:35.670 --> 00:52:36.503
Do you know what I mean?

900
00:52:37.680 --> 00:52:37.980
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

901
00:52:37.980 --> 00:52:42.020
<v 4>I don't understand. I don't, I, this just, it just makes me feel old liquid.</v>

902
00:52:42.030 --> 00:52:45.760
He does the no look pass and then he fucking eats.

903
00:52:45.920 --> 00:52:47.610
He starts miming like, you know,

904
00:52:48.030 --> 00:52:50.400
he has like binoculars on as he looks at the crowd.

905
00:52:50.401 --> 00:52:54.120
Doesn't even look at the end of the, it's like, did Magic Johnson ever do that?

906
00:52:54.150 --> 00:52:58.230
I just, I for the fucking life of me, fuck,

907
00:52:58.260 --> 00:53:01.020
I will never understand that. That's like that dancing.

908
00:53:01.050 --> 00:53:04.800
I told you when I was wet the game and there was some six year old kid dancing,

909
00:53:04.950 --> 00:53:05.790
which should've been adorable,

910
00:53:05.791 --> 00:53:08.180
but he had a look on his face like you wanted to beat the shit out of me.

911
00:53:08.200 --> 00:53:10.740
I was just, I just don't understand what's going on with people.

912
00:53:12.360 --> 00:53:15.810
Just a complete lack of class. And humility is, you know,

913
00:53:15.870 --> 00:53:19.080
and this is coming from a drunk and even I'm noticing,

914
00:53:20.750 --> 00:53:21.583
<v 5>um,</v>

915
00:53:21.870 --> 00:53:25.350
<v 4>anyways, a Kryptonite. Everybody, here we go. Let's do some of these, these,</v>

916
00:53:26.010 --> 00:53:30.510
these letters here. Hello, Bill. Hello Person.

917
00:53:31.200 --> 00:53:34.080
Uh, I don't know. I know you don't give a shit,

918
00:53:34.320 --> 00:53:38.670
but I refuse to stand by and watch you be an idiot. Uh,

919
00:53:38.820 --> 00:53:41.850
but the story of Krypton is the planet x.

920
00:53:41.910 --> 00:53:44.070
Last week I was talking about Kryptonite. I go,

921
00:53:44.071 --> 00:53:46.230
isn't it like fucking natural to his planet?

922
00:53:46.290 --> 00:53:51.290
How can superman be a allergic to a Kryptonite from his planet?

923
00:53:54.631 --> 00:53:55.381
So this guy says,

924
00:53:55.381 --> 00:54:00.381
Krypton the story of Krypton is the planet exploded from nuclear,

925
00:54:01.021 --> 00:54:05.130
from a nuclear chain reaction. That's nice and vague from the family.

926
00:54:05.530 --> 00:54:07.380
Big East caused by the planets,

927
00:54:08.050 --> 00:54:12.390
UNCC unstable radioactive core. All right.

928
00:54:12.391 --> 00:54:15.300
I guess that was a little more of an explanation.

929
00:54:15.510 --> 00:54:20.510
Kryptonite being pieces of the radio active planet that somehow reach earth.

930
00:54:22.290 --> 00:54:23.190
Okay,

931
00:54:23.250 --> 00:54:27.150
well then shouldn't those things also affect the humans that go and get it?

932
00:54:28.710 --> 00:54:29.020
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

933
00:54:29.020 --> 00:54:32.860
<v 4>You don't want, I mean, I don't understand that.</v>

934
00:54:34.740 --> 00:54:38.800
Oh, my phone's fucking rain. God dammit. Do I gotta take this?

935
00:54:40.190 --> 00:54:40.670
<v 6>Okay.</v>

936
00:54:40.670 --> 00:54:44.450
<v 4>Oh, call him back. Um, okay. So that's what it is. All right.</v>

937
00:54:45.230 --> 00:54:50.230
So if the advice somehow got off earth and I went to Krypton and the earth

938
00:54:52.071 --> 00:54:52.904
exploded,

939
00:54:52.910 --> 00:54:57.910
they would then be our earth tonight and then superman could sit right next to

940
00:54:59.361 --> 00:55:03.770
that radioactive rock. I know what this is. Some point you'd be like, Bill,

941
00:55:03.771 --> 00:55:07.160
can you just fucking play along? Can you just play?

942
00:55:07.161 --> 00:55:11.510
You know why I'm not playing along because this guy said I can't watch you be an

943
00:55:11.511 --> 00:55:16.190
idiot. Watch me be an idiot. Like Kryptonite is an actual thing.

944
00:55:20.360 --> 00:55:21.860
This is like, you think I'm an idiot?

945
00:55:22.070 --> 00:55:25.170
Cause I can't name all the broads on sex in the city. I mean this is just fun.

946
00:55:25.320 --> 00:55:30.300
It's a fucking, it's made up buddy. All right. Sorry.

947
00:55:30.301 --> 00:55:32.770
I don't know. The origins of Kryptonite. What?

948
00:55:32.810 --> 00:55:34.320
What does that gotten you in life?

949
00:55:35.330 --> 00:55:36.163
<v 6>Huh?</v>

950
00:55:37.630 --> 00:55:42.160
<v 4>Other than a girlfriend with a retainer in her thirties. All right. Sex,</v>

951
00:55:42.161 --> 00:55:44.920
everybody. I see that people should be slower too.

952
00:55:45.460 --> 00:55:49.930
I think that people should be slower to jump into bed. Friendship and respect.

953
00:55:49.931 --> 00:55:53.020
Go a long way. Please have Nia in yourself.

954
00:55:53.021 --> 00:55:56.800
Encourage young people to respect each other more before sex.

955
00:55:59.020 --> 00:56:02.980
Um, listen, I don't give public service announcements. I mean,

956
00:56:02.981 --> 00:56:04.900
I just complain about Shit. Look,

957
00:56:04.930 --> 00:56:08.830
if you want to go on and get fucking let it go on and get laid. All right. Use,

958
00:56:08.831 --> 00:56:13.600
use the use of fucking protection. But if you actually looking for somebody,

959
00:56:16.380 --> 00:56:17.213
<v 6>um,</v>

960
00:56:17.910 --> 00:56:22.530
<v 4>you know, to have more than that, then you know, I think a,</v>

961
00:56:22.540 --> 00:56:25.900
a you something who I am so emotionally shut down. I,

962
00:56:25.901 --> 00:56:30.220
I can't even speak on this. I don't know how I lucked out into beaten Nia.

963
00:56:30.330 --> 00:56:33.400
It's just fucking happened. All right? But this, okay.

964
00:56:33.920 --> 00:56:35.990
I just loved that somebody like this actually wrote in.

965
00:56:35.991 --> 00:56:38.140
This is very conservative. This is really interesting.

966
00:56:38.141 --> 00:56:41.920
I think that people should be slower to jump into bed. Friendship and respect.

967
00:56:41.921 --> 00:56:45.100
Go a long way. Please have neon yourself.

968
00:56:45.560 --> 00:56:49.210
Encourage young people's to respect each other more before sex.

969
00:56:49.211 --> 00:56:54.130
Like how many listeners do I have my on my podcast at the Catholic church is now

970
00:56:54.131 --> 00:56:57.790
trying to slip in public service announcements

971
00:56:59.750 --> 00:57:03.810
will act week. Well, why don't I give everybody a southern accent?

972
00:57:03.811 --> 00:57:07.210
I'm just gonna have the literally the pope in a southern accent say we'll after

973
00:57:07.211 --> 00:57:11.620
we fucked all those kids. No one's listening to us. Um,

974
00:57:11.830 --> 00:57:14.440
probiotics. Everyone. Hi Bill.

975
00:57:14.441 --> 00:57:18.940
I was just listening to some videos on Youtube, on the youtube channel.

976
00:57:18.970 --> 00:57:22.690
Bill burr archives. Not sure how long ago this one was from,

977
00:57:23.020 --> 00:57:27.250
but you were asking for more information from anyone on how to get clean

978
00:57:27.251 --> 00:57:30.280
probiotics. And I just wanted to say,

979
00:57:30.310 --> 00:57:32.950
look up Kefir, k.

980
00:57:32.951 --> 00:57:37.300
E. F. I. R.

981
00:57:37.300 --> 00:57:38.980
Kefir is not only a racial slur.

982
00:57:40.540 --> 00:57:44.620
I believe it's a racial slur in some country for a group of people

983
00:57:46.130 --> 00:57:48.490
travel so much. I forget where that's frying. I looked that up.

984
00:57:48.820 --> 00:57:52.390
I hope I'm not saying that wrong. Am I gonna have to fucking apologize.

985
00:57:53.710 --> 00:57:58.690
Hang on a second. Camphor racial slur.

986
00:57:59.050 --> 00:58:02.710
I spelled it like what they just said. Oh,

987
00:58:02.711 --> 00:58:07.120
when my internet doesn't work, why won't you fucking work now?

988
00:58:07.121 --> 00:58:08.770
Why won't you work?

989
00:58:09.270 --> 00:58:12.030
<v 7>Yeah. [inaudible]</v>

990
00:58:12.330 --> 00:58:13.163
<v 0>yeah.</v>

991
00:58:15.720 --> 00:58:19.620
<v 4>Oh, that's k. A. F. F. I. R.</v>

992
00:58:20.100 --> 00:58:25.100
The word Khafre is a term used in south southern of Africa to refer to a black

993
00:58:27.601 --> 00:58:30.870
person. All right, let's see that. I knew,

994
00:58:30.871 --> 00:58:33.390
I watched some sad show on how people treat each other.

995
00:58:34.480 --> 00:58:38.340
So I must be saying that wrong. I'm going to say Kiefer, like Sutherland,

996
00:58:39.510 --> 00:58:40.343
keifer.

997
00:58:40.470 --> 00:58:45.470
You can buy the grains and you just add them to your organic milk milk and then

998
00:58:46.411 --> 00:58:47.850
two days later

999
00:58:49.380 --> 00:58:51.750
approximately you have key for yogurt.

1000
00:58:52.500 --> 00:58:56.100
Much better than the store bought ones because they get pasteurized and hence

1001
00:58:56.101 --> 00:59:00.570
you lose a lot of the bacteria. Okay. Cheers. Fuck face. Have a good one.

1002
00:59:01.780 --> 00:59:06.240
All right. But then what about the milk? Where do I get the milk?

1003
00:59:06.241 --> 00:59:11.160
I get the milk from an organic cow. And why don't I just lay off the booze?

1004
00:59:11.640 --> 00:59:14.850
Can I just do that? Would that be easier? Um,

1005
00:59:15.060 --> 00:59:17.970
alright lady needing advice.

1006
00:59:18.480 --> 00:59:20.940
Don't want to go to a male friend's wedding.

1007
00:59:22.460 --> 00:59:25.190
Oh this is great. I can give you advice on this.

1008
00:59:25.191 --> 00:59:29.930
My girlfriend's ex was gross lady needing advice.

1009
00:59:29.931 --> 00:59:32.780
Don't want to go to male friend's wedding.

1010
00:59:33.980 --> 00:59:36.500
My girlfriend's ex was gross.

1011
00:59:39.390 --> 00:59:42.420
I don't care. Okay. Hi Bill. I'm a 23 year old guy.

1012
00:59:42.680 --> 00:59:43.513
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1013
00:59:46.030 --> 00:59:48.700
<v 4>What the fuck is this? I think</v>

1014
00:59:50.540 --> 00:59:54.650
the lady needing advice somehow got cut off. So this is a different one.

1015
00:59:55.070 --> 00:59:59.060
My girlfriend's ex was gross. Well, where's The lady needing advice?

1016
00:59:59.061 --> 01:00:00.530
Don't want to go to male friend's wedding.

1017
01:00:00.770 --> 01:00:04.580
I'll get to the bottom of that by Thursday. All right. Hi Bill.

1018
01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:09.170
I'm a 23 year old guy and I recently moved in with my 23 year old girlfriend.

1019
01:00:09.500 --> 01:00:12.020
Everything was going awesome until one drunken night.

1020
01:00:12.021 --> 01:00:15.350
She starts to tell me what her ex boyfriend was like.

1021
01:00:17.850 --> 01:00:18.360
Okay.

1022
01:00:18.360 --> 01:00:23.360
She explains that when she was 20 she dated this guy who will call Joe,

1023
01:00:24.630 --> 01:00:29.490
who is 11 years older than her, which already fucks with my head.

1024
01:00:29.820 --> 01:00:33.540
So being insecure the next day I decided to look him up online and he's

1025
01:00:33.541 --> 01:00:34.374
disgusting.

1026
01:00:35.070 --> 01:00:40.070
He's fat with an unkempt beard and really short in a pudgy face.

1027
01:00:40.470 --> 01:00:44.550
I just can't wrap my head around the fact that my girl being so hot and young

1028
01:00:44.551 --> 01:00:49.410
Banglaz Slob of a man picturing the two of the two together,

1029
01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:54.270
doing what we do now is really messed up messing me up to the point.

1030
01:00:54.270 --> 01:00:58.500
We stopped having sex a week ago. I just can't get it out of my head.

1031
01:00:59.910 --> 01:01:04.680
Uh, I mean, at one point, that disgusting mess really turned around Gross.

1032
01:01:04.950 --> 01:01:08.370
Am I just being an asshole? Do I break up with her? Honestly,

1033
01:01:08.371 --> 01:01:10.470
I just don't look at her the same way anymore.

1034
01:01:10.710 --> 01:01:13.920
I can handle her vast sexual history before me,

1035
01:01:14.280 --> 01:01:18.450
but not with that mess. It's really screwing me. Thanks. And Go fuck yourself.

1036
01:01:18.560 --> 01:01:21.600
All right, here's one of these things that if you were a woman,

1037
01:01:22.020 --> 01:01:24.720
they would be like, well, you have to honor that.

1038
01:01:25.020 --> 01:01:29.400
You have to know no means no. If you don't like this,

1039
01:01:29.401 --> 01:01:33.330
then you should honor that. That's what you're feeling and your partner,

1040
01:01:33.690 --> 01:01:34.920
if they really love,

1041
01:01:34.921 --> 01:01:39.921
you should understand this and wait until you're able to perform again.

1042
01:01:40.380 --> 01:01:42.000
But that's not how it works with guys.

1043
01:01:42.030 --> 01:01:46.740
You would be judged for being so fucking superficial and blah, blah, blah, blah.

1044
01:01:46.770 --> 01:01:50.220
So fucking superficial writing and the amount of young whores that I saw at

1045
01:01:50.221 --> 01:01:53.730
these old fucking guys at that F1 race, you know,

1046
01:01:55.470 --> 01:02:00.150
um, I don't know what you do to be honest with you, but I mean,

1047
01:02:00.510 --> 01:02:03.300
this is what I would do in the future. I wouldn't Google people. She used to,

1048
01:02:03.301 --> 01:02:07.740
fuck, that's probably a bad thing, but I'm thinking you're only 23 years old.

1049
01:02:07.741 --> 01:02:12.330
How did you know? So she used to fuck this troll probably under a bridge.

1050
01:02:13.740 --> 01:02:18.090
Yeah. That's kind of gross. Probably had some fucking one of those short,

1051
01:02:18.091 --> 01:02:19.410
but fat dicks know.

1052
01:02:21.430 --> 01:02:21.610
<v 5>Yeah,</v>

1053
01:02:21.610 --> 01:02:26.500
<v 4>he cannot have his pubes. Oh, that's so disgusting. Um,</v>

1054
01:02:28.850 --> 01:02:33.020
I would talk to her about it. I would just say, listen,

1055
01:02:34.580 --> 01:02:37.070
you know, I was insecure that you've,

1056
01:02:37.130 --> 01:02:40.640
that you were with an older man and was, you know,

1057
01:02:40.670 --> 01:02:43.040
not confident about what I was doing with you in bed.

1058
01:02:43.240 --> 01:02:46.210
And my curiosity got the best of me and I googled that guy, dude,

1059
01:02:46.260 --> 01:02:48.440
for all you know, you've got the wrong guy. By the way.

1060
01:02:48.441 --> 01:02:51.770
It might be someone with the same name. Who knows? Um,

1061
01:02:53.810 --> 01:02:56.120
you know, I don't know, but it's, I don't know.

1062
01:02:56.960 --> 01:03:00.740
In a week's time he can't get past that. I mean,

1063
01:03:00.741 --> 01:03:02.800
she's probably looking at you like you're a chimp. You're, you're,

1064
01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:06.260
that guy was a 34 year old fat, disgusting. Fucking,

1065
01:03:06.261 --> 01:03:10.940
you're 23 I'm imagining in shape. Right? Um,

1066
01:03:11.720 --> 01:03:12.110
I dunno.

1067
01:03:12.110 --> 01:03:14.390
I don't think it's weird that you looked at the guy and then all of a sudden you

1068
01:03:14.391 --> 01:03:16.700
just pictured and fucking your girlfriend. That's disgusting.

1069
01:03:16.701 --> 01:03:18.960
I don't think that's weird at all. Um,

1070
01:03:18.980 --> 01:03:22.040
women would say it is because they always defend each other for some reason,

1071
01:03:22.041 --> 01:03:25.310
yet they fucking go at each other like alley cats when we're not around.

1072
01:03:27.510 --> 01:03:28.343
<v 5>Um,</v>

1073
01:03:29.090 --> 01:03:33.020
<v 4>I dunno, there's, I guess there's like some female like union, you know,</v>

1074
01:03:33.050 --> 01:03:35.720
they act like union and men are not unionized,

1075
01:03:35.721 --> 01:03:37.640
which just every man from fucking self.

1076
01:03:38.360 --> 01:03:39.193
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

1077
01:03:41.510 --> 01:03:46.440
<v 4>Um, although I am sticking up for you, so who knows? Um, yeah, I would a,</v>

1078
01:03:46.450 --> 01:03:50.290
I don't know. I think I talked to her about it.

1079
01:03:51.330 --> 01:03:53.760
Just say it, you know, what do you think this makes me superficial?

1080
01:03:53.761 --> 01:03:57.340
She's going to be like, yes. I can't believe you judge me like that. Oh, I just,

1081
01:03:58.920 --> 01:04:03.510
I don't judge people on looks. I know you judge them on their wallets.

1082
01:04:04.790 --> 01:04:08.940
Um, if he has a nice personality and a private jet, you know,

1083
01:04:09.120 --> 01:04:13.110
I don't mind a little extra weight. Yeah. What was going on with deck guy?

1084
01:04:13.111 --> 01:04:16.800
Maybe that fat row was taken out to a nice restaurant every night so he could

1085
01:04:16.801 --> 01:04:20.880
keep her and that's how he got fat. I Dunno, you have a giant head too.

1086
01:04:21.790 --> 01:04:26.490
Most big fucking butcher block heads. Alright. Jealousy issues,

1087
01:04:28.110 --> 01:04:33.060
jealousy issues. Uh, dear Billy. Rosy cheeks. First off. I'm a huge fan.

1088
01:04:33.300 --> 01:04:35.100
Keep up all the great work. Anyway,

1089
01:04:35.160 --> 01:04:39.000
me and my girlfriend of four years just moved to France.

1090
01:04:39.270 --> 01:04:41.820
She is French and all our family is here.

1091
01:04:41.850 --> 01:04:45.270
We lived in Australia and planned to go back to Australia and 11 months.

1092
01:04:48.420 --> 01:04:51.660
Sorry. Had to get that yarn up. Our relationship is very serious.

1093
01:04:52.260 --> 01:04:53.700
We never laugh. No, I'm kidding.

1094
01:04:54.600 --> 01:04:58.530
I love this girl so much and plan on popping the questions soon.

1095
01:04:59.640 --> 01:05:02.160
A, we were at a local bar last night.

1096
01:05:02.700 --> 01:05:06.000
I'm not lingual enough to talk well at a bar yet,

1097
01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:09.450
so when we go out it's hard to follow what's being said.

1098
01:05:09.451 --> 01:05:13.380
But I still have a pretty good time after I had a few drinks with her and her

1099
01:05:13.381 --> 01:05:16.110
friends. This guy my girlfriend works with,

1100
01:05:16.320 --> 01:05:21.320
sits with us while it's just me and her about 3:00 AM and I immediately felt

1101
01:05:21.761 --> 01:05:24.970
bad. I had never met this dude, but when he sat down,

1102
01:05:24.971 --> 01:05:29.971
my girlfriend didn't look at me for 10 minutes and was 100% focusing,

1103
01:05:30.490 --> 01:05:33.790
focused on him, leaning in, laughing, et Cetera,

1104
01:05:34.030 --> 01:05:37.870
while I sat on my phone or looking up at the sports. Yeah, dude,

1105
01:05:37.871 --> 01:05:38.704
that's not good.

1106
01:05:39.730 --> 01:05:43.300
<v 6>That's not good. Uh,</v>

1107
01:05:44.010 --> 01:05:45.210
<v 4>repeat that is not good.</v>

1108
01:05:45.240 --> 01:05:48.840
I couldn't understand what they were talking about and there wasn't a way I

1109
01:05:48.841 --> 01:05:52.830
could be a part of it. I didn't like the way this guy was looking at me as well.

1110
01:05:53.010 --> 01:05:55.500
Twice during the time. After 10 minutes,

1111
01:05:55.501 --> 01:06:00.270
she struggly puts her hand on my knee and after five more minutes,

1112
01:06:00.420 --> 01:06:04.410
I tell her we should leave. I say goodbye to her friends and walk outside.

1113
01:06:04.411 --> 01:06:06.600
I smoke a cigarette and wait a bit longer.

1114
01:06:06.780 --> 01:06:11.400
Go back inside and she's still at the bar with this guy paying her bill.

1115
01:06:12.150 --> 01:06:16.140
Same Abiana says before, when we leave to walk home, I mean,

1116
01:06:16.170 --> 01:06:19.020
I'm immediately cold with her. You should have been.

1117
01:06:20.070 --> 01:06:23.600
She fucking embarrassed you. You absolutely should have been you.

1118
01:06:23.650 --> 01:06:25.200
Why you wouldn't do that to her. What'd Ya?

1119
01:06:26.220 --> 01:06:30.360
I was pretty drunk so I expressed my dislike for this situation in an overly

1120
01:06:30.361 --> 01:06:33.600
angry and an impatient manner. Yeah, you should've waited too. You is.

1121
01:06:33.601 --> 01:06:36.330
So this is one of these things, what you are right. And then you were drunk.

1122
01:06:36.331 --> 01:06:38.430
So then you became wrong. By the way. You said it,

1123
01:06:38.850 --> 01:06:41.130
20 minutes into a 30 minute walk home.

1124
01:06:41.280 --> 01:06:46.050
She was tearing up pretty bad and told me she was talking about me and other

1125
01:06:46.051 --> 01:06:49.950
harmless shit. Bull fucking shit.

1126
01:06:51.990 --> 01:06:55.100
She was talking about her dog and her dog was sitting next to it. She,

1127
01:06:55.110 --> 01:06:58.140
at some point you'd be like, look at his face. She would've done that.

1128
01:06:59.130 --> 01:07:04.080
She's full of Shit. This is my gut. Anyways,

1129
01:07:04.081 --> 01:07:07.290
well, the feeling stayed between us when we woke up this morning.

1130
01:07:07.650 --> 01:07:11.700
I don't get to socialize much here and I really liked this bar where everybody

1131
01:07:11.701 --> 01:07:13.950
goes to, but this felt particularly bad.

1132
01:07:14.190 --> 01:07:16.740
My girlfriend acts more natural in this country.

1133
01:07:16.950 --> 01:07:20.100
So this is awesome for her to be with her fellow countrymen.

1134
01:07:20.280 --> 01:07:24.330
But we've never in four years had a conflict where jealousy is an issue.

1135
01:07:24.810 --> 01:07:28.800
Have you ever had an issue where your girl's talking to a dude and it crosses a

1136
01:07:28.801 --> 01:07:33.330
line? Absolutely. Absolutely. And I was drunk and I said something.

1137
01:07:34.890 --> 01:07:37.600
Um, yeah and that didn't end well. Uh,

1138
01:07:37.680 --> 01:07:41.890
can I deal with this without affecting the relationship or how am I girl act

1139
01:07:41.891 --> 01:07:45.240
socially? Deep down. She's an absolute sweetheart and really sensitive.

1140
01:07:45.241 --> 01:07:49.320
So it's a bit delicate. Also, there's a part of me that says,

1141
01:07:49.321 --> 01:07:52.500
maybe it's all in my head. Anyways. Hope you can help bill.

1142
01:07:52.501 --> 01:07:56.370
Any advice would be great. Love to the birth family. Go Fuck Yourself.

1143
01:07:56.371 --> 01:07:59.400
All right, well there's so many factors. Yeah, you could be jealous,

1144
01:08:00.090 --> 01:08:00.811
but you know,

1145
01:08:00.811 --> 01:08:03.960
if it was actually 10 minutes and she didn't look at you and then I said,

1146
01:08:03.990 --> 01:08:05.280
I'll meet you outside. And she's still,

1147
01:08:05.430 --> 01:08:09.640
she's still in there talking to him about what a fucking great guy you are. Um,

1148
01:08:09.900 --> 01:08:14.880
you get some point to you. You, you got, doesn't lie unless your head's fucked.

1149
01:08:16.510 --> 01:08:18.280
All right? If it's coming from your gut,

1150
01:08:18.310 --> 01:08:22.480
if it's not coming from between your ears and it's all this fearful thoughts

1151
01:08:23.110 --> 01:08:25.690
that she had and you need to quiet that down.

1152
01:08:25.691 --> 01:08:28.930
But if it's coming from your gut and your judge guts just saying this just isn't

1153
01:08:28.931 --> 01:08:31.190
fucking right. Um,

1154
01:08:32.030 --> 01:08:36.740
and who's kidding who the French have different ideas about that type of shit

1155
01:08:37.700 --> 01:08:40.610
where, you know, I'm not saying everybody over there, but they, they,

1156
01:08:40.980 --> 01:08:44.960
they're the whole fucking having a Mitch mistress, you know,

1157
01:08:45.470 --> 01:08:50.300
is not looked down upon it seems sort of accepted. Yes. The resentment builds.

1158
01:08:50.330 --> 01:08:52.100
I don't fucking know, but um,

1159
01:08:52.380 --> 01:08:53.213
<v 6>wow.</v>

1160
01:08:55.420 --> 01:08:57.430
<v 4>I, I just don't, uh,</v>

1161
01:08:59.510 --> 01:09:03.380
that whole situation is bad and I actually think her reaching over and pat you

1162
01:09:03.381 --> 01:09:07.870
on the fucking leg to keep, to keep you at bay there. I even think that, that,

1163
01:09:07.871 --> 01:09:11.720
that makes it, that made it even worse. Um,

1164
01:09:14.230 --> 01:09:16.930
now having said all that, you should've waited till the next morning.

1165
01:09:18.340 --> 01:09:18.750
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

1166
01:09:18.750 --> 01:09:20.790
<v 4>Or at least when you walk back, then I just say, listen,</v>

1167
01:09:20.820 --> 01:09:25.470
I'm a little drunk right now, so I don't want to have a big conversation,

1168
01:09:25.471 --> 01:09:30.370
but I would like to talk to you about what just went down with that guy.

1169
01:09:30.700 --> 01:09:31.220
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

1170
01:09:31.220 --> 01:09:32.590
<v 4>Like Dad ever works with a woman.</v>

1171
01:09:32.660 --> 01:09:34.400
<v 8>No, we need this guy. Yeah.</v>

1172
01:09:34.401 --> 01:09:36.970
I think go is sleep knowing you're going to [inaudible] you know,

1173
01:09:38.820 --> 01:09:43.220
<v 4>um, I don't know what the deal, who knows,</v>

1174
01:09:43.280 --> 01:09:45.650
who knows what the fuck that was. I would be like,

1175
01:09:47.790 --> 01:09:48.190
<v 6>alright,</v>

1176
01:09:48.190 --> 01:09:50.590
<v 4>so is she only</v>

1177
01:09:51.320 --> 01:09:51.900
<v 6>okay</v>

1178
01:09:51.900 --> 01:09:55.110
<v 4>the way she is? Because she's in my country and she doesn't know anybody,</v>

1179
01:09:55.111 --> 01:09:57.060
but this is how she, this is how she really is.

1180
01:09:57.840 --> 01:10:02.840
Is this just a cultural thing that she used to fuck this guy and she psyched to

1181
01:10:02.941 --> 01:10:06.180
see him and this is going to be her little fucking fling on the side when we get

1182
01:10:06.181 --> 01:10:08.240
married. I would know what the fuck that thing.

1183
01:10:09.980 --> 01:10:10.813
<v 6>Um,</v>

1184
01:10:11.280 --> 01:10:14.160
<v 4>but I would try to regroup and just be like, you know,</v>

1185
01:10:17.450 --> 01:10:21.050
I find it hard to believe that if I was at a bar and I started speaking a

1186
01:10:21.051 --> 01:10:24.890
language with another woman that you didn't know and I didn't even look at you

1187
01:10:24.891 --> 01:10:29.270
for 10 minutes and then gave you a pandering pat on the fucking leg and then

1188
01:10:29.271 --> 01:10:33.050
tried. And then I went outside for a smoke and I came back in.

1189
01:10:33.160 --> 01:10:37.280
He was still in there talking to this person, this woman, if I was talking,

1190
01:10:37.281 --> 01:10:41.630
I'm saying if I was talking to this woman that I was somehow be able to convince

1191
01:10:41.631 --> 01:10:43.910
you that I was talking about you the whole time.

1192
01:10:44.400 --> 01:10:45.233
<v 6>Okay.</v>

1193
01:10:47.080 --> 01:10:48.460
<v 4>I don't know what to tell you, sir.</v>

1194
01:10:48.520 --> 01:10:53.520
Other than the practice up on your French practice up on your French and do it

1195
01:10:53.681 --> 01:10:57.760
without or knowing. Get that Rosetta Stone Shit.

1196
01:10:57.761 --> 01:11:02.761
Get your French game in order and learn all that [inaudible] 12 fucking,

1197
01:11:03.840 --> 01:11:08.620
uh, what's, what's ass over there? Gross. G, r o s,

1198
01:11:08.800 --> 01:11:12.100
something like that. You gotta know what the fuck he's saying?

1199
01:11:13.830 --> 01:11:17.700
Um, two girlfriends. So I don't know. I don't know what to tell you to do.

1200
01:11:17.701 --> 01:11:19.410
My Gut says that that was fucked up.

1201
01:11:19.470 --> 01:11:21.930
I could just tell you that I'm not trying to drive you away from this woman,

1202
01:11:21.931 --> 01:11:24.870
but that's, that seemed fucked up. If that was coming from you. Got Sir.

1203
01:11:25.410 --> 01:11:29.640
God Damn it, I would go with it. All right. That's it. That's the podcast.

1210

1211
01:11:53.311 --> 01:11:57.390
whatever they call those, those paypal money coin things. Um,

1212
01:11:58.020 --> 01:12:02.220
Brexit. I don't know what it's called. Um, that's it. Um,

1213
01:12:02.250 --> 01:12:03.840
that's what she can do. And if you don't want to do that,

1214
01:12:03.841 --> 01:12:07.230
I completely understand. I don't give a shit if you keep listening. You cheap.

1215
01:12:07.231 --> 01:12:11.760
Fuck. Alright, that's it. Go fuck yourselves. I'll check in on you on Thursday.

1216
01:12:11.910 --> 01:12:14.910
Let's go calves. Congratulations. Penguins.

1217
01:12:15.030 --> 01:12:19.000
My condolences to Nashville fans. Uh,

1218
01:12:19.440 --> 01:12:23.190
thank you to everybody at the Formula One race and um,

1219
01:12:23.880 --> 01:12:26.460
I can't wait to watch the next race. I don't even know where the hell it's at.

1220
01:12:27.240 --> 01:12:28.200
Uh, but I will be watching.

1221
01:12:28.201 --> 01:12:32.220
I actually finally watched the Italian Graham MotoGP. By the way,

1222
01:12:32.221 --> 01:12:35.850
trying to take those fucking races is so difficult. Every time I go to click,

1223
01:12:35.851 --> 01:12:40.230
it's the fucking moto three moto two. It's the fucking time trial.

1224
01:12:40.231 --> 01:12:43.560
I always got to click every single fucking one of them before I finally get to

1225
01:12:43.561 --> 01:12:45.360
the race. I got to see the Italian.

1226
01:12:45.361 --> 01:12:49.440
When these motherfuckers were going like 220 miles an hour on motorcycles.

1227
01:12:50.430 --> 01:12:52.170
And I finally figured out the kilometer thing.

1228
01:12:52.171 --> 01:12:54.990
Every 50 miles an hour is 80 kilometers.

1229
01:12:55.920 --> 01:13:00.660
So you just keep adding 80 every 50. So 5,100 miles an hour.

1230
01:13:00.661 --> 01:13:05.661
One 5,200 miles an hour is 81 62 40 a what the fuck would that be?

1231
01:13:07.231 --> 01:13:11.720
Three 20 roughly. All right. There you go. Piss a little metric system for you.

1232
01:13:11.760 --> 01:13:14.340
Go fuck yourselves. I'll see you on Thursday.
