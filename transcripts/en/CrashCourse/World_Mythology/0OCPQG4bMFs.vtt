00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.400
Hey there I'm Mike Rugnetta.

00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:03.100
This is crash course mythology and today,

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:08.100
we're gonna shift just slightly from our discussion of monsters to talk about...

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:14.300
Monstrous humans! Monstrous human women to be exact. We're discussing witches and hags.

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:20.540
Many, scary, magical ladies. You know what's scariest about them? It's their giant gross moles. Just kidding.

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:22.800
It's their habit of turning people into stone.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.700
Thoth! Noooo!

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:32.640
(Cheery theme song)

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.700
Before we start, a quick reminder that many cultures which created these myths are patriarchal

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.700
and many of the stories we're going to look at are more than a little misogynistic...

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:47.659
devoting an episode to terrifying women doesn't mean we're endorsing the idea that women..

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.500
especially older wiser women are... horrible...

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.659
And actually in many stories, it's not even clear whether these women are really so horrible.

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:02.400
They may just be trying to protect themselves and their place in the social or metaphysical order.

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.200
Really! One myth's forest hag might be 
another's fairy godmother,

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.200
after just a little shift in perspective.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.700
Anyway, just something to keep in mind while we're dissing on all these hags.

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.900
So when I say witch there's almost certainly an image that comes to mind.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.500
Many myths especially folk and fairy tales feature old women described as ugly or misshapen.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.800
And with frightening magical powers.

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.400
There are a few exceptions but most witches use their powers for evil.

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.800
Depending upon the tradition which is
synonymous with or akin... to hag.

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:39.258
In many myths hags are magical old women who are responsible for giving people bad dreams

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:42.919
Some hags even sit on the chest of their sleeping victims

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.600
Sprinkling bad images into their minds.

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.850
In Norse mythology, the hag is called a mare or Mara...

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.180
And they come in the night to torment you.

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.400
A mare at night,  "A nightmare".
Get it? That's a thing, a nightmare.

00:01:57.478 --> 00:02:00.000
In Celtic mythology, there's a hag called the Cailleach,

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:05.240
Who often appears with a staff and likes to make everybody cold and miserable.

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.579
In one Scottish tradition she comes down from her mountain home

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:11.719
On November first beats her staff on the ground and ushers in winter

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.700
But not all Cailleachs manifest such awesome power.

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.640
In one story the Cailleach is basically just a petty thief.

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.200
The story begins long ago in the parish of Kirk loanin where...

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.620
the widow, Ena McCarran lives with her three daughters Calybrid, Calyphony, and Calyvorra.

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.260
Their father having died years ago,

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.340
left behind a leather bag full of gold coins.

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.218
That Ena keeps under the hearthstone in front of the fire.

00:02:35.218 --> 00:02:38.700
The gold coins are how she provides for the family.

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.060
One day an old hag comes knocking at the door,

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.200
*whispering tone* spoiler alert she the Cailleach.

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.100
And she's a hungry Cailleach at that.

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.079
Ena just sees an old woman though, and she doesn't like to turn a beggar away

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:52.240
so she invites the Cailleach in for soup.

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:57.189
When she returns with a shawl to comfort the shivering old woman, the Cailleach is gone and

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.060
So with them with McCarran's stash - without their gold the family is hungry

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:07.220
Desperate eventually Calybrid, the oldest, tells her mother that she's leaving to make her fortune

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.500
and that if she doesn't return in a year,

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:10.920
they can assume that she's made it big.

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.120
Ena a bakes her daughter an oak cake for her journey

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:18.789
But before sending her off Ena asks for one piece of it in exchange for a blessing

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:23.900
but Calybrid doesn't know when she's gonna have her next meal so she refuses her mother.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.109
Early in her journey Calybrid finds a house and...

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:28.627
Surprise! The Cailleach lives there.

00:03:28.627 --> 00:03:32.679
The Cailleach offers Calybrid a job as her maid, but only on one condition,

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:38.037
Never clean the chimney!
Calybrid agrees and goes to sleep.

00:03:38.037 --> 00:03:39.609
The next day Calybrid

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:45.730
Definitely looks in the chimney where low and behold she finds her family's lost bag of gold

00:03:45.919 --> 00:03:48.189
Without thinking twice she sets out for home

00:03:48.189 --> 00:03:50.901
So let's see what happens next in the thought bubble.

00:03:50.901 --> 00:03:51.668
On her way home,

00:03:51.669 --> 00:03:56.200
Calybrid passes a horse who asks her to rub him down. Calybrid refuses.

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.600
Later, she passes a sheep who asks her to shear him. Again, she refuses.

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:05.198
Then, she passes a goat, a lime kiln, a cow, and finally a mill

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:07.310
Refuses them all. At this point,

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:11.340
She's so tired that she goes inside the mill and falls asleep.

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.000
In the meantime, the Cailleach returns home to find that the bag of gold is missing.

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:19.539
Running outside, she finds a horse "Have you seen a girl past this way?"

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:24.309
"I have", says the horse. The same with the sheep, the goat, the lime kiln,

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:30.700
The cow, and the mill who says "I've got her sleeping inside me, right now."

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:34.690
The Cailleach creeps inside and touches Calybrid's shoulder with a hazel wand

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:37.240
Turning her into stone.

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.009
A year and a day later the second daughter,

00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:43.149
Calyphony decides it's her turn to go fortune seeking and it's the same deal

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:50.500
Oat cake, no blessing, maid job, chimney, bag grab, horse, sheep, goat kiln, cow, mill refusal, falling asleep

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.560
And yep turned to stone.

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.800
Another year and a day later. It's Calyvorra's turn.

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.369
Unlike her greedy sisters,

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:58.650
she gives a piece of the oatcake to her mother.

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:01.800
She takes the job, steals the gold, gets on her way.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.800
But when she comes across the horse,
She rubs it down.

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.820
She shears the sheep, and changes the goats tether,

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:09.869
Cleans the lime kiln and milks the cow.

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:15.030
She turns the mill and after all her hard work, she falls asleep on a sack of flour.

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:18.920
Presumably not noticing the stone statues of her sisters.

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:21.059
When the Cailleach rushes off to find Calyvorra,

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:25.900
She asks the animals and the kiln if they seen her and each one says, "No."

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:28.780
When she gets to the mill and asks if it saw the girl,

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:30.839
The mill catches the Cailleach in its cogs and

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:31.980
grinds her up.

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:32.480
Thanks, thought bubble!

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:34.800
The Cailleach screams wake Calyvorra

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.010
And the helpful mill..

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:39.780
tells her to pick up the wand and touch the stones in the corner.

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:41.969
As soon as the wand touches them they turned back...

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:44.560
into her very surprised sisters.

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:47.309
The mill then tells Calyvorra to touch the wand to the leather bag

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:52.260
And it will never be empty and then to burn the wand so it can never harm..

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:53.470
anyone again.

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:56.490
The girls do as they're told and return home to their mother..

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:58.060
with the leather bag.

00:05:58.060 --> 00:05:59.909
The story contains a lot of familiar tropes of the...

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:02.580
dangerous and devious witch;

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:05.190
She looks like an old woman, she shows up on someone's doorstep,

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:06.670
she has a house in the woods,

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:10.640
And she has a magic wand that she uses for nefarious purposes.

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:12.749
And like monsters and other mythical creatures,

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:15.809
she's notable for her ugly wrinkly appearance.

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:20.159
It's kind of a bummer that old age is used as a sign of evil so often.

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:22.679
I mean I've met a ton of old folks and only like

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:26.340
Six of them tops were probably magical villains.

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:29.880
Another hideous old woman who is more than she seems is Baba Yaga.

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:31.650
And no, the story is not about John Wick.

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:33.959
It's about the hag of Russia and Eastern Europe.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.210
But she's just as terrifying if you cross her, with bulging eyes that can turn people to stone.

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:44.600
Apparently, stoning people is like the go-to spell for old magical ladies.

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:50.000
Anyway, she lives alone in a birch forest in a hut that sits atop a pair of chicken legs.

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:56.120
The hut is surrounded by human skulls and each day the hut is visited by three ghostly riders,

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:59.300
One dressed in white, one in red, and one in black.

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:01.800
These riders represent the passage of time.

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:08.000
Baba Yaga flies through the night sky on a giant mortar that she rose with a giant pestle.

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:11.349
She wipes away her tracks with a birch broom and like the Windigo,

00:07:11.469 --> 00:07:15.360
she's a cannibal with a penchant for luring princesses to her hut

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:17.200
For...*awkward cough*

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:18.160
Dinner.

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:23.780
According to Brenda Rosin, some scholars believe that originally, Baba Yaga was a potent female nature spirit,

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:25.210
A provider of healing,

00:07:25.729 --> 00:07:27.560
Protection and guidance.

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:30.938
In this respect she's similar to another terrifying female creature from Greek mythology.

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:37.090
The Gorgon, Medusa. This snake headed stone making lady may not seem to be much of a protector or a guide.

00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:42.069
But there's one myth that says blood from the right side of a Gorgon can bring a corpse...

00:07:42.259 --> 00:07:43.440
back to life.

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:45.639
While blood from the left side is...

00:07:45.889 --> 00:07:47.120
deadly poison.

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:50.079
Turns out also, the name Medusa is related to the ancient Greek word for...

00:07:50.719 --> 00:07:52.719
'protect' and can be translated as...

00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:53.840
'guardian'.

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:57.760
So maybe she just has a bad reputation because of mean old Perseus

00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:00.100
and of course her petrifying visage.

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:04.080
These three different frightening females are from different times and places,

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:05.705
but they have a number of things in common.

00:08:05.705 --> 00:08:08.600
They're hideous, ancient and dangerous.

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:10.480
One wrong move and you get turned to stone.

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:15.200
Hags are seen as monstrous because of their ability to transform themselves and others,

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:17.288
and their tricky conniving ways.

00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:22.060
But perhaps they also reflect a societal discomfort with old age

00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:28.659
Which works its own transformations on the body and cultures that valorize youth that old age can seem...

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:31.600
Terrifying! Especially when it comes to women.

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:33.519
But old age is also very powerful.

00:08:33.979 --> 00:08:37.300
Especially when you have a hazel wand or a snake hairdo to swing around.

00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:39.939
Next time we start our two episode wrap up of...

00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:42.940
the whole series! I know I'm gonna miss you too, Thoth.

00:08:42.969 --> 00:08:44.340
I'm also gonna miss you guys.

00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:48.820
We're gonna talk about Freud and Jung and the psychological aspects of mythology.

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:49.539
