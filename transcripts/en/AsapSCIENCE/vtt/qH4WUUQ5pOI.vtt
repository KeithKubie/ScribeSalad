00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:12.580
You want to take on mitosis?

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:14.140
Let me get your diagnosis;

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:15.440
It says you're half the man I am

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:16.600
And all your raps are necrosis!

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.500
Yeah, I am so perfectly perfect

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:19.460
In all my careful divisions

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.000
Creating identical versions

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.240
While you are like "Oh I'm so different!"

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:23.200
Don't talk to me &gt;:c

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.300
You've been around the block too many times

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:26.240
And your duplicate splitting is

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:27.180
Constantly spitting out

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.480
FOUR daughter nuclei?

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:29.280
Don't be jealous 'cause I am sexy,

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:30.840
And I got 2 sets of phases

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.360
I like to mix DNA up

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:34.180
When I'm entering my pro-phase stages!

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.280
You're like your parents kid;

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:36.500
Just like a clone.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.360
You see this chromosomal genetic

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:39.340
combination's my own!

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:39.840
 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:40.340
I'm independent

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:41.800
My chromosomes don't need any pairs

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:42.300
 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.180
At the end there's only 23

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:45.620
So your mom and dad can share and make

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.120
LIFE! Yeah, I'm the one that

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.160
Gives you your offspring

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:49.320
Though my genetic variance

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.080
can create arrogance

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.360
DNA's changing from New York to Beijing.

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.720
Sure, if it weren't for you

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:53.800
I wouldn't have kids

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.180
But if I wasn't here

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:56.180
THEN YOU WOULDN'T EXIST!

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.000
And those babies you keep bringing up?

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.140
Aww, real cute!

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:00.800
I'm the one that makes them grow

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.180
So you can stop CLEANING THEIR PUKE!

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:03.160
You're like telophase;

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:04.420
The only thing that's worth admiring

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:05.440
is your cleavage

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.200
I don't want to give half of my chromosomes up, what I've built in my nucleus is my achievement.

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.440
I'm like telophase too, I like to kick back and unwind

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.120
But I'm secretly Anaphase

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:13.700
Pulling you apart from inside!

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:14.820
I repair the whole body

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.180
to make you grow big and strong

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:17.660
If I wanted sex cells

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:18.940
I would just ask your mom

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:20.900
Hey! Here's a question,

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.040
Maybe you have the answer?

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.640
Did you know you're the main cause

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:24.900
FOR A WHOLE BUNCH OF CANCERS?

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.760
Yeah, your errors cause a LOT of conditions

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.140
 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:30.400
