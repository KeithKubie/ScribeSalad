00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:03.830
We've said it before and we're going to say
it again, video games help your brain!

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:14.420
So excuse me while I go play whichever first
person shooter won't get me made fun of 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:15.490
in the comments.

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:21.630
20 years ago, THE MAN blamed video games for
violent behavior and legislation was debated

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.010
banning violent games from sale; but today,
a new study in Policy Insights from the Behavioral

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:31.720
and Brain Sciences, claims video game players
are getting more than the privilege of listening

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.250
to Peter Dinklage's sultry tones.

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.149
Action games do seem to provide some kind
of brain benefit.

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:42.920
A study earlier in 2015 by the Max-Planck
Institute of Human Development scanned players

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.910
of three-dimensional games and found increased
brain development in the prefrontal cortex,

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.990
right hippocampus and cerebellum; areas involved
with complex cognitive tasks, navigation,

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:55.700
fine motor control, and spatial memory!

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:01.239
And, a study from the University of Geneva
found individuals who play "action video games"

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:05.670
were markedly better at switching their attention
from one part of the screen to another while

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.920
remaining vigilant to the environment as a
whole; meaning they're processing visual information

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.249
more quickly than non-gamers.

00:01:13.249 --> 00:01:17.530
Players know that during modern gaming, they’re
required to follow video and audio streams,

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.950
as well as haptics (or vibration and touch-based
feedback).

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.649
Sometimes two or three different streams might
hit your senses at the same time.

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:28.490
For example, if you're chatting with other
players while reading or listening to the

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:29.490
game itself.

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.039
Plus, especially in action games, players
are required to navigate three-dimensional

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:37.939
complicated arenas, solve puzzles, and often
interact with both real and pre-programmed

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:39.850
players.

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:45.669
This trains our brains to suck in lots of
information and process it quickly… which

00:01:45.669 --> 00:01:47.369
makes our brains "Better" sort of.

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:48.700
Depends how you look at it.

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.770
Whether these skills translate off the grid
and into meatspace is a whole other thing,

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.420
and it would seem, on some level, they do.

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.419
The brain isn't trained by repetition in the
same way muscles are toned, but in combination

00:01:59.419 --> 00:02:00.880
it can be useful.

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.130
The military uses video game-style simulations
all the time for training, finding they can

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.590
expose servicemembers to complicated or dangerous
situations that wouldn't be practical in real

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:11.590
life.

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.439
Then the warrior takes the skills learned
and can use them as a baseline for real life

00:02:15.439 --> 00:02:16.439
training.

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:20.129
Video games are also used for flight students,
potential astronauts, medical students and

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:21.129
surgeons.

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:25.629
We shouldn't overlook going through the motions
in a virtual world, paired with real-life

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:26.629
practice.

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:27.629
Games aren't perfect though.

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:31.939
They can negatively impact social skills,
attention and a study in Psychological Science,

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:37.769
found playing as a quote "villainous avatar"
resulted in the participants punishing anonymous

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:39.520
strangers in real life.

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.750
This is more a correlation than causation
thing.

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.129
People pick the video games that interest
them, and can often choose their own avatars

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:48.719
then control that character's behavior.

00:02:48.719 --> 00:02:54.269
The researchers in the "action game study"
want to remind the world, it's a matter of

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:55.269
degrees.

00:02:55.269 --> 00:03:01.439
Video games aren't just one thing, but LOTS
of different things.

00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:05.510
A flight simulator, is not a first person
shooter, is not a real-time strategy, is not

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:11.739
a puzzle game, is not a brain training game;
and they all affect cognitive behaviors.

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:18.469
Video games require the brain to actively
learn, almost a half-way between book-learning,

00:03:18.469 --> 00:03:19.659
and hands-on activity

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:23.849

the worst video games ever made.
