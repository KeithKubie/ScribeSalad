Speaker 1:          00:00          I've got a leadership situation I need help with. I was promoted to a troop commander position over a fellow team leader who now reports to me. He has many years of experience and a lot of knowledge. He's very, he's very bitter and not getting the promotion at not getting the promotion and is letting me know when I include him in decision making for the troop or try to tap into his knowledge and experience. He, he shuts down, refuses to give input and says that I should already have the answers. Since I'm the troop commander, I know the troop would benefit from his input and team dynamics would be much improved if it wasn't so negative. I've tried to let him know that I value, I value his experience. I feel that his input would be beneficial and that his negative attitude and bearing and bearing are not acceptable. It is making him very ineffective team leader, I'm, I'm failing at getting through to him and I don't want, fuck, I don't want to fire him for his position. How can I get him to value his own position in the troop and become effective? Again,

Speaker 2:          01:07          I actually think you're doing the right thing and you've opened the door for him. So I think that's a good first initial approach. But obviously it doesn't seem to be working. Now a couple of different courses of actions you could take. One of the things you could do is actually give them some higher responsibility, right? Getting put his team in charge, put him in charge of the whole team. Sometimes maybe he will step up and start to lead and see that he's now able to prove and that you have a lot of trust in him and all that stuff. There's also a chance, think about this. There's also a chance that you might be coming off as condescending to him. So imagine this, hey, I go, I value your experience. Oh No. Right now, you know, the troop would really benefit from your input. It's, it's like you're treating him like he's a kid and he's getting that.

Speaker 2:          01:51          Those can come off as condescending. So we have to put those a little bit in check as well. And I think those are a little bit, you know, you put the, put the person in charge, you try that you've opened up to try and get their input and get them involved. But it's, it might be coming, it might be coming across as condescending even if it's, even if you're doing it, even if you're just saying, hey man, could really use your input on this thing, it'd be great. Even if you're doing it in like a cool way in your mind, you might be hearing, oh, I could really use your help. So even if you're saying it in a perfect way, it still might be hitting his ears in a different way. So I don't know. At this point, I think when I would do is I would maybe just back off, I would just go forward, uh, treating him like one of the leaders and expect him to perform as you expect your leaders to perform.

Speaker 2:          02:37          I think you've made the effort, it didn't really work and now you have a job to do and you've got to get on with it. There's also, you know, the world doesn't revolve around his pouting and his being negative and, and you, you can't let that happen. Now on top of that, this guy's a powder and he's a negative guy. That's probably the reason he didn't get selected to be promoted. What we talked about earlier, that boss saw that, that he saw something along the way where things didn't go his way and he, and he pounded into his negative and that's why he didn't get promoted. Meanwhile, the guy that did get promoted when things didn't go his way, he's like, okay, cool. Well we'll drive on with what the new plan is and that's why you got promoted. So I would say, move on, do your job.

Speaker 2:          03:21          Treat him like you would treat one of your leaders. I be very careful that you don't over-correct because you hear me say like, okay, I'm gonna treat him normal. Now all of a sudden you're treating them like crap. Don't do that. But treat him as firmly and as fairly as you would any one of your subordinate leaders. And we have to see where it goes from there. He may end up just not being able to deal with this fact. I mean, there's, there's a reason why some people get promoted and some people don't. And maybe he's one of these people that can't humble himself, which is one of our biggest fears in somebody that's trying to be a leader is that they can't humble themselves. And if that's what's going on, he's going to have a long, hard road. And you know whose fault it is going to be? Never his never going to be his fault. It's everyone else's fault. And, and that's, that'll be problematic.
