Now that you've seen alpha and jitter in action I'd like

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.640
you to use your new knowledge of them to explore the relationship

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.730
between friends initiated and age. Build your plot up in layers

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:12.540
and be sure to use the g g plot syntax. I really

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.500
recommend playing around with this in our studio, and then once

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.790
you've got your finalized plot, copy and paste your code into the

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:22.240
browser and submit it. There's no right or wrong answer here and

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.330
there's a couple of different ways to make the plot. So just

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.670
be sure that once you have your final plot, you copy and paste all of your code

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:32.250
into the browser and submit. After you've created your

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.090
plot, share any of your findings in the discussions.
