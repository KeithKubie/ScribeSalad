- IT'S NOT
ALL ABOUT YOU, BOBBY.

00:00:50.184 --> 00:00:51.185
- STUPID, BOBBY.

00:00:51.218 --> 00:00:53.687
- THIS IS ABOUT
THIS BEAUTIFUL SPECIMEN

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.556
THAT WANTS TO BE
A GIGOLETTE.

00:00:55.589 --> 00:00:56.957
- I WANNA BE
A STRAIGHT-UP GIGOLO.

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.958
THAT'S WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT.

00:00:57.991 --> 00:00:59.159
I WANNA BE LIKE
ONE OF YOU.

00:00:59.193 --> 00:01:00.961
I GREW UP
WITH MANY BROTHERS.

00:01:01.061 --> 00:01:03.063
AND, LIKE, I WATCHED THEM
[bleep] THEIR GIRLFRIENDS

00:01:03.063 --> 00:01:04.097
THROUGH A KEYHOLE.

00:01:04.131 --> 00:01:06.600
AND I WAS LIKE,
"I KNOW WHAT THEY LIKE

00:01:06.633 --> 00:01:08.101
AND I KNOW WHAT MEN NEED."

00:01:08.135 --> 00:01:10.804
- BEFORE WE GET ANY FURTHER,
DO YOU HAVE A RESUME FOR US?

00:01:10.838 --> 00:01:12.806
- UM, I THINK
I BROUGHT MY RESUME...

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.077

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:18.312
- WHERE?
- SO BASICALLY,

00:01:18.345 --> 00:01:19.813
IF YOU DON'T SEE A RESUME

00:01:19.847 --> 00:01:22.082
IN FRONT OF YOU
RIGHT NOW,

00:01:22.115 --> 00:01:24.451
THEN YOU'RE BASICALLY
MAJORLY TRIPPING.

00:01:24.484 --> 00:01:27.421
- MANY WOMEN ARE LOOKING
TO LOCK DOWN A HUSBAND,

00:01:27.454 --> 00:01:29.523
SOMEBODY REAL, A BOYFRIEND.

00:01:29.556 --> 00:01:32.993
ARE YOU LOOKING FOR NOTHING
BUT CASUAL SEX,

00:01:33.093 --> 00:01:36.597
A CYCLE OF NONSTOP [bleep]
IN YOUR HOLES?

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.398
- I'M COMFORTABLE WITH THAT
VERY MUCH SO.

00:01:38.432 --> 00:01:40.767
THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NOBODY
IN MY LIFE

00:01:40.801 --> 00:01:43.003
THAT I EVER WOULD HAVE
FEELINGS FOR EVER AGAIN

00:01:43.103 --> 00:01:44.805
'CAUSE I'M [bleep]ING DONE
WITH FEELINGS.

00:01:44.838 --> 00:01:47.107
- REALLY?
- AND RIGHT NOW,

00:01:47.107 --> 00:01:48.809
FROM WHAT I'VE BEEN THROUGH,

00:01:48.842 --> 00:01:51.311
I'M BASICALLY LIKE A MACHINE
AT THIS POINT.

00:01:51.345 --> 00:01:53.847
- WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

00:01:53.881 --> 00:01:56.683
- UGH, YOU RUIN EVERYTHING
I TRY TO DO.

00:01:56.717 --> 00:01:58.619
WHENEVER I TRY
TO MAKE SOMETHING OF MYSELF,

00:01:58.652 --> 00:02:02.422
IT'S LIKE YOU'RE RIGHT THERE
TRYING TO CUT ME DOWN.

00:02:02.456 --> 00:02:04.124
- I JUST WANNA BUILD YOU UP.

00:02:04.157 --> 00:02:05.425
- WHAT?
- I JUST WANNA BUILD YOU UP.

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:07.294
- BOBBY, NO ONE CAN HEAR YOU
WHEN YOU CRYIN'

00:02:07.327 --> 00:02:09.129
90% OF THE TIME.

00:02:09.162 --> 00:02:10.297
- I DON'T CRY.
- HE CRIES A LOT.

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:11.465
- NONSTOP.

00:02:11.498 --> 00:02:14.368
IT'S LIKE LITTLE BOY BLUE
OR SOME [bleep].

00:02:14.401 --> 00:02:16.737
- OKAY, I THINK
WE'VE HEARD ENOUGH.

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.939
YOU EMBODY
ALL OF THE ATTRIBUTES

00:02:18.972 --> 00:02:20.541
THAT IT TAKES TO BE
A GIGOLO.

00:02:20.574 --> 00:02:23.544
SHE IS BEAUTIFUL,
SHE IS INTELLIGENT,

00:02:23.577 --> 00:02:26.079
AND SHE IS GOOD TO GO
SEXUALLY.

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:28.081
WELCOME TO GIGOLO HOUSE.

00:02:28.115 --> 00:02:29.650

00:02:29.683 --> 00:02:31.318
THANK YOU.

STARTS SAYING

00:02:32.886 --> 00:02:34.655
LIKE WHAT I CAN
AND CANNOT DO

00:02:34.688 --> 00:02:35.789
BEIN' THAT I AM A WOMAN.

00:02:35.822 --> 00:02:38.225
HOW ABOUT HULLARY CLINTON?

00:02:38.258 --> 00:02:40.227
- BRO, IF THERE WEREN'T
A GIGOLO CODE,

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.461
I WOULD STRAIGHT-UP
PUNCH YOU IN THE--

00:02:41.495 --> 00:02:44.598
- BRO, I DON'T GIVE A [bleep]
ABOUT THE CODE.

00:02:44.631 --> 00:02:46.333
I WILL END YOU.

00:02:46.366 --> 00:02:47.634
- HOW ABOUT YOU FORGET
THE CODE

00:02:47.668 --> 00:02:51.972
AND JUST HIT HIM
IN HIS STUPID FACE?
