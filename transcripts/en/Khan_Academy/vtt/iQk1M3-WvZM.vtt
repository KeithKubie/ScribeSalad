00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.950
Match each function
to its interval

00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:04.789
as it appears on
the graph below.

00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:06.330
There will be
functions and intervals

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:07.663
left over when you are finished.

00:00:07.663 --> 00:00:10.100
So we have this
crazy-looking graph here.

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:13.400
And what we want to do is think
about what expressions define

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.050
the different parts
of this graph.

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:17.790
So if we thought,
for example, that

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:21.300
in the interval between where
x is greater than or equal to 3

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.210
and x is less than 7, that
this is being defined by 1/x,

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.120
we would drag this into
that just like that.

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.170
So to help us think
through it, I've

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:32.490
copy and pasted this thing
onto our scratch pad.

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:35.260
And let's just go
interval by interval.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.300
So this starts at x is
greater than negative 4,

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.720
not greater than or equal to.

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.560
Or we could say it starts at
negative 4 is less than x--

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.014
not less than or equal to,
because the function is not

00:00:47.014 --> 00:00:47.930
defined at negative 4.

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:49.820
We have an open circle here.

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.250
But let's see what a
good candidate expression

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.750
is for this part
of the function.

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.460
So to do that, let's just find
some nice, well-defined points

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:57.960
here.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.140
So it looks like
we have that point

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:05.420
over there is the point negative
2 comma-- looks like 1/2.

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.320
We have the point here,
which is negative 1 comma 1.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.410
And those look
like two good ones.

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:14.607
So let's see which of
these seem to work,

00:01:14.607 --> 00:01:15.690
at least for those points.

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:17.450
Maybe we can rule out some.

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.160
So 1/x-- so let's see.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:26.460
If x is negative 2, 1/x would be
negative 1/2, not positive 1/2.

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.020
So this isn't being used to
define this first section.

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.090
So we can rule that out for
at least the first section.

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.510
Now let's see.

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:36.640
f of x is equal to negative 1/x.

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.170
Now, this looks pretty good.

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.850
Negative 1 over negative
2 is positive 1/2,

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:43.900
so it works for that.

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:47.930
Negative 1 over negative 1 is 1.

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.410
So this right over
here seems to work

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:53.370
for at least this interval.

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:54.330
So it seems to work.

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.190
We're doing negative 1/x.

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:58.100
And it seems to work
even after that,

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.172
where we have the point right
over here, 1, negative 1.

00:02:02.172 --> 00:02:04.340
Negative 1 over 1 is negative 1.

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.169
And over here, you
have 2, negative 1/2,

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:10.639
which is also consistent
with this right over here.

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:16.260
So I would throw this
one-- and so this function

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.280
works from the interval
negative 4 is less than x,

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.730
which is less than
or equal to 2.

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.820
So that's this interval
right over here.

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.150
So let's actually fill that in.

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:34.030
So that is-- actually,
you can't see it.

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.240
It's off the screen right now.

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.670
That is that interval
right over there.

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.110
Now let's get back to
my little scratch pad.

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:49.450
Now, our function is not
defined for x between 2 and 3.

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.830
But then starting at 3, the
function gets defined again.

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:52.470
And let's do the same thing.

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.450
Let's look at some
interesting points

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:55.860
that might prove valuable.

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.831
So this point right
over here-- actually,

00:02:57.831 --> 00:02:58.830
let me do it in magenta.

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.240
You have this point, which
is the point 3, negative 2.

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:05.180
You have this point right over
here, which is interesting,

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.687
5 comma 2.

00:03:08.687 --> 00:03:10.270
So let's test some
of these points out

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:12.040
and see which of these work.

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.100
Well, 1/x definitely
doesn't work.

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.170
1/5 is not 2.

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:17.610
Negative 1 over x doesn't work.

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:20.590
Negative 1 over 5 is not 2.

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:25.170
1 over 5 squared is not 2.

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.122
1/2 times 5 plus 5
to the third power--

00:03:27.122 --> 00:03:28.330
that's 10 to the third power.

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:29.330
That's 1,000 times 1/2.

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.920
That's 500.

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.872
This goes to 502, not 2.

00:03:31.872 --> 00:03:33.580
So we're going to rule
this one out, too.

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.090
So let me rule it
out for the interval

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.190
that we now care about.

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:42.490
We now care about this interval,
or this part of the function.

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:43.390
So let's see.

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:47.590
If we have 5 here-- 5 minus 5 is
0, to the third power is still

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.090
0, times 1/2 is
still 0, plus 2 is 2.

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:54.280
So this point is consistent with
this function right over here.

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.920
Now, let's see.

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.295
Does that work
for 3, negative 2?

00:03:56.295 --> 00:04:00.240
3 minus 5 is negative 2, to
the third power is negative 8,

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:02.990
times 1/2 is negative
4, plus 2 is negative 2.

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:06.990
So this looks like a
pretty good candidate.

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:09.570
Let's just make sure we
can rule this one out, too.

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:10.070
Let's see.

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:11.520
5 comma 2-- let's see.

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:14.740
5 plus 5 is 10, squared
is 100, times 1/2 is 50.

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:18.300
52, not 2, so we can rule
this one out, as well.

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:21.430
So it looks pretty clear that
we could use this expression

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.880
to define the
interval x is greater

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.040
than or equal to 3 and less than
7, not less than or equal to.

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.620
It's not defined at 7.

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:33.720
So we could use this for this
interval right over here.

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.770
So let's go back to
the actual exercise.

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:40.390
And so we said this one for
this interval right over here.

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:45.800
And let's make sure that we got
it right So check our answer,

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:47.530
and we did.
