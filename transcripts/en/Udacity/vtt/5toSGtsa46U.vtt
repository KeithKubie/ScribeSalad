00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:04.140
Hopefully, your analytics dashboard
is now showing some activity in

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.960
the shopping behavior and
checkout behavior dashboards.

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:11.960
But so far, the checkout
process has been very simple.

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:19.250
The steps are, view product, add to
cart, start checkout and purchase.

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:21.390
But there are some steps missing.

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.040
Where do we send the tasty dinner?

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.180
And what are the payment details?

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.490
The checkout process itself
is a multi step process.

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.550
You have to get the shipping address,
get payment address,

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:40.225
get payment details,
confirm the details, review order,

00:00:40.225 --> 00:00:45.725
and then finally, do the purchase.

00:00:49.005 --> 00:00:52.095
So here's an example of a checkout
process with a bunch of steps.

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.250
Start the checkout.

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:56.370
Get the customer info.

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.134
Get the billing info.

00:00:59.134 --> 00:01:01.270
Let the customer review the cart.

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:03.230
Confirm the checkout.

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.670
And there would be one more step
which is to complete the purchase.

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.640
There are two things you have to do to
display the checkout steps in analytics.

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.209
You have to update your code to include

00:01:13.209 --> 00:01:16.673
the step number when your
app sends a check out hit.

00:01:16.673 --> 00:01:19.804
And then the admin console,
you can add funnel sections for

00:01:19.804 --> 00:01:21.630
the checkout process.

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.480
This part's actually optional but

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:28.550
if you don't name the check out
steps then they appear as step one,

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:33.540
step two, step three and so
on which is not very helpful.

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.230
So here's an example where we have
step one, step two, step three,

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:40.100
step four and we don't know what's
going on at each of these steps.

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.701
It's really very easy to add
nice labels for these steps.

00:01:44.701 --> 00:01:46.940
So here's how to set a heading for
the steps.

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:52.959
You go to the admin console,
choose Ecommerce settings down here for

00:01:52.959 --> 00:01:57.123
the view, and
then just add some funnel steps.

00:01:57.123 --> 00:02:00.310
So you add the steps that you'll be
tracking, and give them relevant names.

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.230
And don't forget to press
submit when you're done.

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:09.008
Sometimes the submit button scrolls
off the bottom of the screen and

00:02:09.008 --> 00:02:09.850
it's easy to forget it.

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.930
Then, take a look at
the Checkout report.

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:24.613
So go to Reporting &gt;
Ecommerce Shopping Analysis.

00:02:24.613 --> 00:02:29.840
And checkout behavior and then you'll
see the steps with the new labels.

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.359
It's your turn now to add the checkout
step to analytics account.

00:02:35.359 --> 00:02:36.609
Go to Ecommerce.

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.550
And set up the funnel steps, right here.

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.150
Then go back to the reporting tab to

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.850
see the steps in the checkout
behavior analysis screen.

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:51.350
Check the boxes here when you've
added the checkout steps.

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:52.700
We'll be adding the code next.
