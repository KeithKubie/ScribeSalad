00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:03.823
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:06.570
&gt;&gt; It is my honor and my pleasure

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:13.190
to introduce Elizabeth
Alexander this morning.

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:17.883
Her achievements are varied and many
as a poet, essayist, playwright,

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:20.586
teacher, and as a mentor.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:26.226
And in particular, I want to single
out the quiet and essential role

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:29.330
of the mentor of the trailblazer.

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.633
She shapes the lives of tomorrow's
leaders in the classroom,

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:38.593
is chair of African-American Studies
at Yale University and as a poet

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.166
of course she introduced the world

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.220
to our nation's leader
President Barrack Obama

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.516
by reciting her poem Praise Song
for the Day at his inauguration.

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:54.026
In doing so, she became only the
fourth poet in our nation's history

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.530
to participate in the highest
ceremony marking our democracy.

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:00.246
The National Endowment
for the Arts is happy

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.126
to have supported the publication of
this poem and some 17 years before

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.536
that the NEA awarded Elizabeth
Alexander a creative writing

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.843
fellowship to support her
development as a poet.

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:16.476
It's safe to say that
that investment paid off.

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:16.710
From her debut collection The
Venus Hottentot to the blues

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.463
and jazz reefs of her Pulitzer
Prize finalist American Sublime,

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:25.153
Elizabeth Alexander has
tracked the path, the personal

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:29.780
and the historical inverse.

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.246
And we as a people are
richer for that journey.

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.460
I particularly recommend
her collection of new

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.196
and selected poems Crave Radiance.

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.046
And this is available at the
book signing area for purchase

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.486
and also her signing will be
from 11:30 to 12:30 this morning.

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.763
So please join me in
welcoming Elizabeth Alexander.

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:55.510
[ Applause ]

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.833
&gt;&gt; Good morning everybody.

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:10.323
Thank you for answering back.

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:11.683
That's always nice and thank
you John Piddy [phonetic]

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.163
for that lovely, lovely introduction
and for that money 17 years ago.

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.550
It really does make a difference.

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.683
And it particularly makes a
difference in the life of poets.

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:24.950
We do our work.

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:27.903
We know that we have readers.

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.236
We know that human beings whither
without poetry and without art.

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:39.136
But sometimes as an art form it
doesn't get a lot of attention

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:43.250
and so when that acknowledgment
comes it means a lot

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:45.503
to us in our little tribe.

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:47.920


00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:51.736
Washington, D.C. is where I
grew up and so I wanna start

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.776
with a couple of Washington poems.

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:56.380
Summertime.

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.006
Where we live there are
caged peacocks in summertime.

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.380
Heavy in the heat, bald
headed, dragging their tails

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.283
which once a season they unfurl.

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.926
Objects wrinkle in the heat
waves rising from the pavement.

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.690
A dead rat in the back alley
gets a proper burial from a girl

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.850
who can flip her eyelids inside out.

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:26.256
And at the funeral, I wear my white
go-go boots and sing I gotta be me.

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:32.216
We buy coverless comic books cut
rate impossibly red vending machine

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:35.020
pistachios which stain our hands.

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:38.030
A hydrant illicitly opened.

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.840
Kids riding the hard spray
caught in the rainbow of water.

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.536
On television, senators
talk, talk, talk.

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:53.983
A Wham-O Super Ball bounces off a
sidewalk crack and into the cosmos.

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:58.783
A red rubber planet could
bounce to the sky and stick.

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:01.320


00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:05.790
And another Washington poem and a
childhood poem, Washington Etude.

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:12.430
After rain mushrooms appear in
the park but you cannot eat them.

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.113
1967, the year of the locust.

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:22.963
They come to Northwest
Washington by millions

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:28.146
and for days I crunched shed husks
beneath my feet as they rattle

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:31.343
and hiss their rage from the trees.

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:36.510
Baby teeth bite, baby onion
grass and honeysuckle nipples,

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.306
tiny tongue balancing
the clear sweet drops.

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:42.726
I am a hummingbird.

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:45.793
A cat who laps cream from the bowl.

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.880
Dandelions are yellow
one day, white the next.

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:56.363
A mud puddle surrounded by brambles
and blackberries is where God lives.

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:01.310
Buttercups under my chin
tell me all I need to know.

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:03.843
Nothing blue occurs naturally

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:07.396
in Washington someone
says and I believe it.

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:08.640
I'm put to bed when it's still light

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:13.760
and hear other children
playing out my window.

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:15.756
Watch daylight bow.

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:20.646
Regard the flare of blooming
stars, the cicada's maraca.

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:23.350
[ Applause ]

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:26.936
&gt;&gt; And it seems apt today actually

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:33.170
that almost any Washington
poem I could have read

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:40.476
from this book references the
weather though it is not yesterday.

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:42.396
But, you know, we tropic
flowers are used to this.

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:46.250
That's what it is to
grow up in Washington,

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:49.676
D.C. But it's nice to see fans.

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:53.790
I feel we should all have
beautiful fans on a day like today.

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:56.986
Ars Poetica Number 100, I Believe.

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:02.913
Poetry, I tell my students,
is idiosyncratic.

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:08.890
Poetry is where we are ourselves,
(though Sterling Brown said

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:13.646
"Every 'I' is a dramatic 'I'")
digging in the clam flats

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:18.860
for the shell that snaps,
emptying the proverbial pocketbook.

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:24.936
Poetry is what you find in the dirt
in the corner, overhear on the bus,

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:29.916
God in the details, the only
way to get from here to there.

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:36.020
Poetry (and now my voice is
rising) is not all love, love, love,

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:40.290
and I'm sorry the dog died.

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:46.480
Poetry (here I hear myself loudest)
is the human voice, and are we not

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:51.463
of interest to each other?

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:53.430
And I thought about
that quite a bit,

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:55.533
have thought about that quite
a bit over the last few years.

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:01.726
The idea of poetry as the
human voice and that one

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:07.770
of the many things that poetry does
for us kind of large is give us

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:08.790
that distilled and precise
human voice with which to reach

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:15.196
across the voids that
separate human beings.

00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:18.176
And I think that's very important.

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:24.706
This is another, there's a whole
series of Ars Poeticas in this book

00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:26.693
and one of them, the one that I just
read, is sort of a classical one

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:30.623
in the sense of it is about
the art of writing poetry.

00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:33.840
But then as I kept going
with them I thought what

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:38.380
about the art of the everyday?

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:42.360
What about the artfulness
with which we do small things

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:44.040
in our day-to-day lives.

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:47.906
And so a whole series of
Ars Poeticas grew from that.

00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:51.263
And this is a poem called
Ars Poetica Number 28,

00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:56.710
African Leave-Taking Disorder
which I have to always tell,

00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:00.390
but good you laughed
because you know

00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:00.610
that that's not really a disease.

00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:06.610
And that the poem will make clear
to you what I'm talking about.

00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:09.180
African Leave-Taking Disorder.

00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:11.443
The talk is good.

00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:14.643
The two friends linger at the door.

00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:17.380
Urban crickets sing with them.

00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:18.516
There is no after the
supper and talk.

00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:22.003
The talk is good.

00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:23.496
These two friends linger at
the door, half in, half out,

00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:28.510
'til one decides to
walk the other home.

00:08:28.810 --> 00:08:33.210
And so they walk, more talk, the
new doorstep, the nightgowned wife

00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:34.450
who shakes her head and smiles from
the bedroom window as the men talk

00:08:38.710 --> 00:08:41.110
in love and the crickets sing along.

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:46.440
The joke would be if the one now
home walked the other one home,

00:08:46.650 --> 00:08:49.716
where they started, to
keep talking, and so on:

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:52.233
"African Leave-Taking Disorder,"

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:56.053
which names her children
everywhere trying

00:08:57.340 --> 00:08:59.406
to come back together and talk.

00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:01.700
[ Applause ]

00:09:08.810 --> 00:09:10.410
&gt;&gt; This is a dream poem.

00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:13.270
So enter the landscape, crash.

00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:19.906
And I've been, this poem, I've
been thinking about in particular.

00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:24.553
It's about a dozen years old
but I've been thinking about it

00:09:24.650 --> 00:09:25.260
in the last couple of years with
the change of administration

00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:31.440
and the challenges that
that brings to the populace.

00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:36.793
Crash. I am the last woman off
of the plane that has crashed

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:42.266
in a cornfield near Philly,
picking through hot metal

00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:45.196
for my rucksack and diaper bag.

00:09:46.510 --> 00:09:50.443
No black box, no fuselage, just
sistergirl pilot wiping soot

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:53.960
from her eyes, happy to be alive.

00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:58.123
Her dreadlocks will hold
the smoke for weeks.

00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:02.636
All the white passengers
bailed out before impact,

00:10:03.010 --> 00:10:06.143
so certain a sister
couldn't navigate the crash.

00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:07.993
O gender. O race.

00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:11.650
O ye of little faith.

00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:16.550
Here we are in the cornfield,
bruised and dirty but alive.

00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:18.953
I invite sistergirl pilot home
for dinner at my parents',

00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:26.620
for my mother's roast chicken
with gravy and rice, to celebrate.

00:10:28.510 --> 00:10:29.510

&gt;&gt; Black Poets Talk about the Dead.

00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:46.840
"Like Toni," he said, "who came
plain as day to my dream last night

00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:49.926
in a gangster beret,
tangerine-colored suit,

00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:53.416
thigh-high go-go boots,
she tipped that brim

00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:55.603
and said, how ya like me now?

00:10:57.110 --> 00:10:57.463
After Etheridge passed I went to
see his women with my daughter

00:11:00.890 --> 00:11:03.690
who was six at that
time and had loved him.

00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:04.696
We slept in the room where he'd
slept and in the night my child woke

00:11:08.210 --> 00:11:11.343
up and said I was talking
to Etheridge just now.

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:13.986
Can't you smell his cigarettes?

00:11:14.770 --> 00:11:17.170
After she left us we felt mom close.

00:11:18.970 --> 00:11:22.770
She had passed but not crossed
and those where good weeks.

00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:27.873
Her soup in the freezer,
perfume in her handkerchiefs,

00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:30.836
half empty cups of
her tea grown cold.

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:35.173
But bit by bit she
left and then was gone.

00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:38.643
They do that so we can mourn.

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:41.720
They do that so we believe it.

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:43.853
It is what it is, wretched work.

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:49.400
That we who the dead
live behind must doom.

00:11:58.840 --> 00:11:59.840
Autumn Passage.

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:04.546
On suffering, which is real.

00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:11.140
On the mouth that never closes,
the air that dries the mouth.

00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:17.166
On the miraculous dying
body, its greens and purples.

00:12:19.970 --> 00:12:21.903
On the beauty of hair itself.

00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:26.876
On the dazzling toddler:
"Like eggplant," he says,

00:12:27.650 --> 00:12:31.183
when you say "Vegetable,"
"Chrysanthemum" to "Flower."

00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:33.056
On his grandmother's suffering,
larger than vanished skyscrapers,

00:12:37.290 --> 00:12:39.956
September zucchini,
other things too big.

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:46.826
For her glory that goes along with
it, glory of grown children's vigil,

00:12:47.170 --> 00:12:50.636
communal fealty, glory of
the body that operates even

00:12:51.930 --> 00:12:55.996
as it falls apart, the body that
can no longer even make fever

00:12:57.050 --> 00:13:01.450
but nonetheless burns florid and
bright and magnificent as it dims,

00:13:05.050 --> 00:13:07.983
as it shrinks, as it
turns to something else.

00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:25.753
Having become my grandmother by
always carrying a folding umbrella

00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:29.670
in my pocketbook, by virtue

00:13:31.370 --> 00:13:35.036
of having reached the age she
was when I first knew her.

00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:39.506
I always carry peanuts,
Kleenex, spare pencils.

00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:43.640
I now understand just in case.

00:13:44.950 --> 00:13:49.550
I am the woman who drills a finger
in a child's mid-spine for posture.

00:13:52.010 --> 00:13:55.076
I wear red lipstick, no
longer buy cheap shoes.

00:13:57.340 --> 00:13:58.873
I see who I have become

00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:02.606
when my child parrots
gracious or lord have mercy.

00:14:04.030 --> 00:14:08.163
I perched like a bird, smack dab
in the middle of a power line.

00:14:10.130 --> 00:14:12.196
My life half coming, half done.

[ Applause ]

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:27.560
&gt;&gt; So I'm gonna read two
poems and then I would love

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:28.560
to have a conversation with you all.

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:30.360
So then we'll have some questions

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:32.460
and then I'll finish
with one read poem.

00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:38.260
So this poem was written in,
after watching an Obama rally

00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:45.366
in Miami in October of 2008.

00:14:48.090 --> 00:14:51.556
And the poem, it starts with
that image but it is not

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:56.526
about that moment or about
that person, hopefully.

00:14:57.300 --> 00:14:58.833
That was not my intent.

00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:00.006
My intent was that it would do
meditate on something larger

00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:05.060
than the moment but
start in the moment.

00:15:05.490 --> 00:15:07.156
Rally Miami October 2008.

00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:11.623
The awesome weight
of the world had not

00:15:13.570 --> 00:15:16.370
yet descended upon his
athlete's shoulders.

00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:20.606
I saw someone light
but not feathered jog

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:25.933
up to the rickety stage like a
jock off the court, played my game,

00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:29.913
did my best and the silent
crowd listened and dreamed.

00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:35.186
The children sat high on
their parents' shoulders.

00:15:36.210 --> 00:15:36.913
Then the crowd made noise
that gathered and grew

00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:41.373
until it was loud and
was loud as the sea.

00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:42.383
What it meant or would mean was not

00:15:44.070 --> 00:15:48.336
yet fixed nor could be though
human beings always tilt toward we.

00:15:52.010 --> 00:15:53.610
Praise Song for the Day.

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:59.126
Each day we go about our
business, walking past each other,

00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:03.366
catching each other's eyes or
not, about to speak or speaking.

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:06.186
All about us is noise.

00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:09.920
All about us is noise and
bramble, thorn and din,

00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:12.766
each one of our ancestors
on our tongues.

00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:14.686
Someone is stitching up a hem,
darning a hole in a uniform,

00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:22.006
patching a tire, repairing
the things in need of repair.

00:16:23.650 --> 00:16:24.143
Someone is trying to
make music somewhere,

00:16:25.890 --> 00:16:29.556
with a pair of wooden spoons
on an oil drum, with cello,

00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:31.580
boom box, harmonica, voice.

00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:35.780
A woman and her son
wait for the bus.

00:16:37.110 --> 00:16:39.510
A farmer considers the changing sky.

00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:42.833
A teacher says, "Take
out your pencils.

00:16:43.210 --> 00:16:47.410
Begin." We encounter each other
in words, words spiny or smooth,

00:16:49.730 --> 00:16:53.263
whispered or declaimed, words
to consider, reconsider.

00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:55.316
We cross dirt roads and highways
that mark the will of someone

00:16:58.670 --> 00:17:02.936
and then others, who said I need
to see what's on the other side.

00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:04.080
I know there's something
better down the road.

00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:09.413
We need to find a place
where we are safe.

00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:12.883
We walk into that which
we cannot yet see.

have died for this day.

dead who brought us here,

00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:25.920
who laid the train tracks, raised
the bridges, picked the cotton

00:17:27.050 --> 00:17:28.916
and the lettuce, built brick

00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:33.216

they would then keep clean

00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:34.506

Some live by "love thy
neighbor as thyself,"

others by "first do no harm" or
"take no more than you need."

filial, national.

pool of light.

preempt grievance.

to take a few minutes

00:18:45.620 --> 00:18:49.220
for your questions before
concluding with a short poem.

00:18:50.090 --> 00:18:50.670
Are there any questions
about anything at all?

[ Pause ]

00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:01.593
&gt;&gt; Do you teach poetry?

00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:06.593
&gt;&gt; I have taught poetry over
many, many years in the university

00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:12.393
and also in summer workshops and
when I go give reading sometimes.

00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:17.266
Now, in my job at Yale
University, I teach literature only.

00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:18.033
I teach African-American literature

00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:19.883
but I sometimes teach
in summer workshops.

00:19:22.250 --> 00:19:24.116
&gt;&gt; Can ask you a second one?

00:19:24.250 --> 00:19:25.250
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:19:26.250 --> 00:19:27.496
&gt;&gt; Do you think-- so is there a
basic structure of your poetry

00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:31.936
or are you describing
a concept or an image?

00:19:33.390 --> 00:19:34.570
I mean, is there a rhythm that
you're trying to gather or?

00:19:36.010 --> 00:19:37.010
&gt;&gt; In my poems?

00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:39.010
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:19:40.010 --> 00:19:41.410
&gt;&gt; Well, I hope that each
one is radically different

00:19:42.010 --> 00:19:43.276
and utterly itself.

00:19:44.010 --> 00:19:45.943
So I'm not a poet who comes out
of any one particular school

00:19:46.010 --> 00:19:47.810
or any one particular form.

00:19:48.010 --> 00:19:48.016
I like to think of the creative
process that my mind is a rolodex

00:19:52.270 --> 00:19:53.673
and you just spin, and spin,
and spin, and spin, and spin

00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:54.633
and have a lot of different options
for ways, directions to go in,

00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:01.233
shapes with which to craft and sort

00:20:01.850 --> 00:20:04.650
of enclose the material
of the poem itself.

00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:09.780
So, no school, no doctrine,
just trying to be as wide open

00:20:12.190 --> 00:20:14.056
as possible so that the poem

00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:20.366
when it mysteriously comes can have
the proper craft options with which

00:20:21.670 --> 00:20:21.686
to make it what it ought to be.

00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:24.720
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:26.920

&gt;&gt; There's one like yes?

00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:29.810
&gt;&gt; Hi. I teach ninth and
twelfth grade English

00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:35.230
and I introduce students
to your poetry.

00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:37.703
They watched the video
of the inauguration

00:20:39.570 --> 00:20:40.593
and they watched Maya Angelou's
On the Pulse of the Morning.

00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:43.480
&gt;&gt; Oh, nice.

00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:45.213
&gt;&gt; Ones who previously
been unenthusiastic

00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:47.813
about poetry you could see
them get it like really.

00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:49.480
&gt;&gt; Wonderful.

00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:52.346
&gt;&gt; But I don't always have
inaugural events at my disposal.

00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:54.013
And that's my question.

00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:55.066
It's so disheartening when
I start the poetry unit

00:20:57.160 --> 00:20:59.826
and the stereotypes
begin and they groan.

00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:00.886
And do you have any
suggestions for the ones

00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:04.120
who just have these preconceived
notions of how to light a fire.

00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:07.106
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Did you say
seventh and eighth grades?

00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:09.706
&gt;&gt; No, ninth and twelfth.

00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:11.440
&gt;&gt; Ninth and twelfth.

00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:13.706
See, here is the problem.

00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:16.040
When they're young they don't
have those preconceived notions

00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:17.530
and when they're young they have
an inherent attraction to pattern,

00:21:18.950 --> 00:21:21.283
rhythm, rhyme, memorizations, song.

00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:27.206
It's so much easier with younger
kids and then somehow this kind of,

00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:28.486
you know, poisonous vapor gets
into the room and tells them

00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:31.266
that poetry is hard and they won't
get and they're missing something

00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:33.280
and they're not understanding it.

00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:35.280
So that's what you're up against.

00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:37.536
And my advice would be to continue
to take them back because, you know,

00:21:41.290 --> 00:21:41.490
one of the things that I've done.

00:21:43.290 --> 00:21:43.690
I've never been a high
school teacher

00:21:45.290 --> 00:21:46.290
but I've done workshops
with high school kids.

00:21:47.290 --> 00:21:48.666
And I ask them to learn and recite
something and then they say, mm, mm,

00:21:50.580 --> 00:21:54.713
mm and I say, you know what, you
could recite 500 popular songs

00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:58.640
or rap songs for me right now.

00:21:58.740 --> 00:22:01.873
And then, of course they
can, every single word.

00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:02.466
So, you know, I say let's try to
bring those two things together.

00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:06.383
Let's think about what those
practices have in common.

00:22:08.830 --> 00:22:13.030
And I think also there are resources
better even than recordings

00:22:15.550 --> 00:22:19.150
of inaugural poems because
of course one of the aspects

00:22:21.860 --> 00:22:22.600
of reciting a poem at an
inaugural is that it's a very,

00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:26.520
very, very solemn occasion.

00:22:26.830 --> 00:22:28.830
And so therefore I think calls

00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:29.000
for a certain kind of
sobriety in delivery.

00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:34.720
But there are, for
example, a wonderful series

00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:36.800
of books called Poetry Speaks.

00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:37.800
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.

00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:39.800
I know that.

00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:42.200
&gt;&gt; Do you know those?

00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:43.800
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:46.466
&gt;&gt; And now there is Poetry
Speaks kind of for teenagers.

00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:47.800
&gt;&gt; Oh, okay.

00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:50.933
&gt;&gt; With poems that are in varying
ways thought to speak to some

00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:51.666
of the concerns of young
people of that age.

00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:55.200
I won't say to speak to teenage
angst but to speak to young people.

00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:55.163
And what's beautiful about
this series, Poetry Speaks,

00:22:57.970 --> 00:23:02.303
is that it comes with a CD of poets
reading their work and I think

00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:05.073
that that's a terrific resource.

00:23:05.270 --> 00:23:08.403
I think also I would put
the students themselves

00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:09.710
because they're younger
than we are to work

00:23:12.210 --> 00:23:14.210
on the internet finding videos

00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:17.576
of people reading their
poetry because I'm amazed.

00:23:18.770 --> 00:23:22.436
There is so much more than I
can find with my abilities.

00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:27.573
And I think that that
would engage them as well.

00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:28.306
But I think also to always remind
them that performance is one thing

00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:32.796
and poetry does live in
the voice and in the body.

00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:37.443
But also, part of your job is

00:23:37.510 --> 00:23:38.176
to teach them how to
read it on the page.

00:23:39.510 --> 00:23:40.510
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:23:41.510 --> 00:23:42.310
&gt;&gt; And so that's, you know, when
I'm writing a poem that's my work.

00:23:45.110 --> 00:23:46.110
That's my work.

00:23:47.110 --> 00:23:48.160
Reading it well is not a job
requirement but writing it well is.

00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:51.260
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:23:52.260 --> 00:23:53.260
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:23:54.260 --> 00:23:55.260
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:23:56.260 --> 00:23:57.460
&gt;&gt; You're welcome.

00:23:58.260 --> 00:23:59.260
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:01.260
[ Applause ]

00:24:02.260 --> 00:24:03.260
&gt;&gt; Hi.

00:24:04.260 --> 00:24:04.593
&gt;&gt; Great question and great answer.

00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:08.793
I don't know if I could follow but
for those of us who like to write,

00:24:08.260 --> 00:24:08.993
it'd be interesting
to know how you began,

00:24:10.260 --> 00:24:12.060
how you plan where you're going
to end and most important,

00:24:12.260 --> 00:24:12.460
how you edit when you're writing?

00:24:14.260 --> 00:24:16.193
&gt;&gt; Well, editing is the most.

00:24:16.260 --> 00:24:17.606
Well, I won't actually say it's the
most important part although I feel

00:24:19.580 --> 00:24:20.430
I always must say it's
the most important part

00:24:21.730 --> 00:24:24.396
because so often people
say, do you edit?

00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:27.666
And I wanna say, do you
edit, what do you mean?

00:24:27.990 --> 00:24:29.656
That's most of what I do.

00:24:29.990 --> 00:24:30.700
That's most of what I do is pages
and pages and pages of editing

00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:34.746
and that's how you make it
perfect and that's how you

00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:37.746
or aspire to making it perfect.

00:24:38.550 --> 00:24:42.616
I think for me, once again and
I hope this is useful to people

00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:44.820
who are, you know, no poet.

00:24:45.730 --> 00:24:46.340
It's not-- you can't
support yourself with it.

00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:49.096
Every single poet has a full-time
day job for the most part

00:24:51.010 --> 00:24:52.166
because you don't, you know, you
don't make much money off of it.

00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:58.120
And so I think what that demands
is the ability to kinda walk

00:24:59.080 --> 00:24:59.146
around with a bubble
for it in your head.

00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:05.146
To always know that even if
you don't have, you know,

00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:06.433
Virginia Woolf's A Room
of One's Own and even

00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:12.166
if you don't have fresh flowers and
beautiful spring day and, you know,

00:25:12.210 --> 00:25:16.876
peacefully slumbering children that
you can always attend to your work.

00:25:17.010 --> 00:25:19.076
You can always keep a notebook.

00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:19.403
You can always jot things down
and then when you are able

00:25:22.970 --> 00:25:23.770
to find a little piece of time and
it doesn't even necessarily have

00:25:26.570 --> 00:25:27.100
to be-- I used to think
I needed whole days

00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:30.773
at home with nothing planned.

00:25:30.890 --> 00:25:31.356
Well, I don't have
those days anymore.

00:25:32.890 --> 00:25:35.490
So an hour you can
get a whole lot done.

00:25:36.670 --> 00:25:41.136
The poet Lucille Clifton who passed
away in February who was a very,

00:25:42.490 --> 00:25:43.126
very, very great American poet whose
work I'm sure many of you know.

00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:50.786
She had six children and she said
a natural state for writing poetry

00:25:52.070 --> 00:25:54.136
for me is at the kitchen table.

00:25:54.450 --> 00:25:54.573
And she said two kids are fighting.

00:25:56.660 --> 00:26:00.260
One has the measles, dinner
is burning and in the midst

00:26:01.250 --> 00:26:03.183
of all that I can listen for.

00:26:04.450 --> 00:26:05.000
And I think also part
of her point is that all

00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:09.633
of that is the stuff
of the poems as well.

00:26:10.310 --> 00:26:10.546
So I think of poems as something
that we attend to by going

00:26:13.940 --> 00:26:17.340
through whatever our normal
days are alert and alive

00:26:17.870 --> 00:26:18.166
and with our ears open and
keeping track of things and then

00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:21.953
when we have a little quiet time
and we don't need a whole lot of it.

00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:29.460
You just keep on plugging away,
plugging away, plugging away.

00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:33.373
And that, since we are at
time, the poem I wanna conclude

00:26:34.780 --> 00:26:38.046
with was written right
after Lucille Clifton died.

00:26:38.390 --> 00:26:42.856
And one of the amazing, amazing
things that she taught so many of us

00:26:45.030 --> 00:26:49.096
as poets and as human beings is
that worlds could be expressed

00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:52.680
in very, very, very small spaces.

00:26:53.650 --> 00:26:55.983
Her work was exquisitely condensed.

00:26:56.190 --> 00:26:59.256
It also understood that
none of us stands alone

00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:03.433
at this particular point
on the historical line.

00:27:03.670 --> 00:27:07.470
We come from people and we
move forward into other people.

00:27:08.270 --> 00:27:09.363
But we're connected with the
people who came before us

00:27:10.710 --> 00:27:11.536
and were connected with the
people who come after us.

00:27:13.350 --> 00:27:16.816
And so I got from her a
wonderful sense of continuity

00:27:16.850 --> 00:27:20.783
and of ancestral wisdom that
is accessible if you let it be.

00:27:21.220 --> 00:27:24.553
So this poem to end and
also just thank you so many

00:27:25.710 --> 00:27:27.643
of you for coming for poetry.

00:27:27.850 --> 00:27:28.093
It's a wonderful and
heartening thing to see.

00:27:30.540 --> 00:27:33.606
And I'm really, really
happy to have been here.

00:27:34.130 --> 00:27:37.663
And this poem is called One
Week Later in the Strange.

00:27:40.370 --> 00:27:44.636
One week later in the strange
exhilaration after Lucille's death.

00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:51.160
Our eyes were bright as
we received instructions.

00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:55.166
Lined up with all we
were supposed to do.

00:27:56.730 --> 00:28:00.996
Now seers, now grace notes, now
anchors, now tellers, now keepers

00:28:03.470 --> 00:28:05.736
and spreaders, now wide open arms.

00:28:07.700 --> 00:28:10.566
The cold wind of generational
shift blew all

00:28:10.970 --> 00:28:12.970
around us stinging our cheeks,

00:28:14.190 --> 00:28:18.056
awakening us to the open spaces
now everywhere surrounding.

00:28:20.570 --> 00:28:21.903
Thank you very much.
