00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:05.090
So a patient of blood type A can only receive blood from a individual who either

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:09.910
has an A antigen only, or no antigen at all. So that would be either

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:15.490
type A, which we don't have an option, or type O, which we do, thank goodness.

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:20.270
If we gave the patient type AB or B, although this top option,

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:25.670
AB has The possibility of an A antigen type

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:28.890
in it. It also carries with it B, and this

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.390
patient doesn't recognize B, and its body is going to mount

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.070
an immune response, and attack that blood. And of course,

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.950
type B by itself offers no A, right. There's just B,

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.830
so the body's going to attack that. Whereas type O,

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:42.860
doesn't have any antigen, and the body's not going to see

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:44.910
it as a foreign object, because it's not going to recognize

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.180
anything. And that way, we can successfully have the blood transfusion.
