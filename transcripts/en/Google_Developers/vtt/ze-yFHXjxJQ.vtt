TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hello.

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.080
I'm Timothy Jordan for
"The Developer Show."

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.204
This is your weekly update
on the coolest developer

00:00:06.204 --> 00:00:07.680
news from Google.

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.920
Play Time is our annual global
event series for Google Play,

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.320
and it kicked off last week
with some exciting updates

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.494
to the platform.

00:00:14.494 --> 00:00:16.410
Take a look at the post
to learn about updates

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.754
to app bundles, the Instant
Apps size limit increase,

00:00:20.754 --> 00:00:22.170
reducing crash
rates and improving

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.780
quality, and much more.

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:27.516
Spinnaker now includes a
new Kubernetes provider

00:00:27.516 --> 00:00:28.890
that allows you
to take advantage

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.050
of the full flexibility
of Kubernetes

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.990
while abstracting away much
of the complexity of managing

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:35.400
manifests.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.830
It also integrates with
the Helm package manager

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:41.130
to template your manifests,
and includes initial support

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:43.410
for traffic shaping
via [INAUDIBLE]..

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.500
Details and screenshots
are on the post.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.020
Compose Actions
and Gmail add-ons

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.050
make it easy for you to add
attachments, reference records,

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.090
or liven up your
messages with content

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.370
from your favorite
third-party apps right

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.140
as you draft your
message in Gmail.

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.360
And they're now
generally available.

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.580
Head on over to the post
for some examples and a link

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.340
to the developer documentation.

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:09.480
The Go 1.11 runtime is now
available in beta in the App

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:10.980
Engine standard environment.

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:14.080
For all the details and a
video to help you get started,

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.020
head on over to the post.

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.400
OK, so this isn't a
new API or anything,

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.370
but I thought it was
just too cool to pass up.

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:23.520
The Google Cloud team recently
partnered with NASA's Frontier

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.420
Development Labs 2018
Astrobiology Mission

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.020
to simulate and classify
the possible atmospheres

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.350
of exoplanets and the
search for signs of life.

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.570
For more on what that
means, what the teams did,

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.330
and what's next, take a

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.234

Thanks for watching, and
we'll see you next week.

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.182
SPEAKER 1: There's a
dog in the background.

00:01:52.182 --> 00:01:53.890
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Were
you able to see him?

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:54.556
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:01:54.556 --> 00:01:56.340
I could see his shadow.
