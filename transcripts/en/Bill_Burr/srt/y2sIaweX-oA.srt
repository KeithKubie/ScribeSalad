1
00:00:01,130 --> 00:00:01,880
Okay.

2
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:05,150
Hey, what's going on? It's Bill Burr and
It's time for the Thursday afternoon.

3
00:00:05,151 --> 00:00:07,820
Just before Friday.
Monday morning podcast and

4
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:08,953
ahhh

5
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:14,620
Just checking in on you.
What's, uh, what's going on?

6
00:00:14,621 --> 00:00:16,620
I am actually doing this podcast.

7
00:00:16,621 --> 00:00:19,470
I'm in the middle of a radio tour right
now and I have a 15 minute break and I'm

8
00:00:19,471 --> 00:00:22,890
on my way to the fucking airport after
that. And after bike Cleo, we, oh,

9
00:00:22,891 --> 00:00:27,020
we're going to buy her some dog food, you
know, so my wife has some of the Fiji,

10
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:31,860
isn't it? Right? Boring. All right,
get out of here. Go lay down cutie. Um,

11
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:33,481
so I got a full day,

12
00:00:33,481 --> 00:00:36,720
so I'm trying to knock out 15 minutes
before I go back to doing the radio tour,

13
00:00:36,721 --> 00:00:40,470
which is why I sound like I'm already
off and running as opposed to my, you,

14
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:44,760
I guess I'm never chilled a laid back.
So I've been doing morning radio, um,

15
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:49,800
to hype my St Louis and Kansas
City, uh, dates that are coming up.

16
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:54,540
And, uh, then also I got this,
uh, Canadian tour that I'm doing.

17
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,110
And, um, so I just spent on the fucking
radio all day and everybody's just,

18
00:00:58,111 --> 00:00:58,944
you know,

19
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:03,150
I was thought more Canadian fucking Djs
were going to bust my balls about the

20
00:01:03,151 --> 00:01:06,780
Bruins. I guess you can't, you know,

21
00:01:06,781 --> 00:01:10,650
considering not one Canadian team
is gonna make the fucking playoffs,

22
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:15,030
which is playoffs, which is insane. Not
One of them. Clio. Can you believe it?

23
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:19,980
Not The fucking blue blockade.
Douche is not Ottawa,

24
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,560
Not Toronto. Toronto, Toronto.

25
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:28,140
Not The fucking, uh, the Calgary
flames. The Edmond didn't.

26
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:33,000
Oil is the Vancouver Canucks
or the Winnipeg jets.

27
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:36,030
You know, I don't think that's
good for hockey. I mean,

28
00:01:36,031 --> 00:01:39,510
it's a funny thing to bring
up as an American when I
go up there and believe me,

29
00:01:39,511 --> 00:01:43,020
it will be brought up. Now I'm not going
to rub your faces in it. How could I?

30
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:44,690
Yeah,

31
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:49,490
but God Damn Bruins, you know,
we're a three seat now. We're,

32
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:52,520
we're like, we've launched
six of the last seven

33
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:58,160
fucking unbelievable. Thank God
for Toronto. Got To love Toronto.

34
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:00,980
Most generous fucking team out there.

35
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,070
They're always there to pick
you up off the mat, aren't they?

36
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:08,570
That's the only team we beat
fucking laws to everybody,

37
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:13,160
Rangers, Panthers, San
Jose, Anaheim, the kings.

38
00:02:13,161 --> 00:02:17,700
And then we just fucking lost two to
one hat breaker to the fucking devils.

39
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:20,540
Now like we're playing bad. I still
think we're going to get in there.

40
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:22,533
You know what I mean?

41
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:27,550
I just want us to make the
playoffs so fucking clickbait. Uh,

42
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:31,840
Dan Shaughnessy doesn't start writing
his dumb ass fucking articles about how

43
00:02:31,841 --> 00:02:33,750
they need to do something.
It's Selfie beat.

44
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:36,610
A coach is so fucked up cause you
got to deal with the Dan, Shauna,

45
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:41,260
C's of the world. How unathletic does
that guy look? You know what I mean?

46
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:45,190
He doesn't even look like he plays
chess either. He just looks like a dope,

47
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,740
let's say, and I don't, but
I've never just seen a deck.

48
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:55,310
Fucking guy should be run out of
Boston. His whole fucking thing.

49
00:02:55,311 --> 00:02:59,180
He lives for the moment when
the home team isn't doing well.

50
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:03,010
That's his whole fucking thing. I had
never forget that when the fucking,

51
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:07,030
I think it was when the red sox won
the world series. Finally, he was like,

52
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:10,900
I don't even know how to
write this article because
she had doubt your negative

53
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,273
comment.

54
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:17,090
I bet if a fucking plane crashed into
the stadium and killed the whole fucking

55
00:03:17,091 --> 00:03:18,130
home team, you that, that,

56
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:21,890
that article would be a breeze
as you pretended to be sad.

57
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:27,140
Um, oh dog. That guy drives
me nuts. It drives me nuts.

58
00:03:27,141 --> 00:03:29,060
He should be writing for
a New York newspaper.

59
00:03:29,061 --> 00:03:34,010
He Shits on fucking Boston
team so much. Um, so anyways,

60
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:38,660
anyways, where the fuck am
I cleo for the love of God.

61
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:42,740
Are you allergic to your bed?
That's all you do. Is itch now.

62
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:47,870
Huh? Look at that. Face that face.

63
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:53,150
That's stupid that my dog had
such a classic pooch face.

64
00:03:53,151 --> 00:03:55,850
It's ridiculous. Is that
what they call you? Clean up?

65
00:03:55,851 --> 00:03:58,700
Was that your nickname in
high school? Oh, poach face.

66
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:01,850
Can you get over there and lay down and
stop looking at me like I didn't take

67
00:04:01,851 --> 00:04:03,890
you out. Well, I didn't take it
out. I let you down the stairs,

68
00:04:03,891 --> 00:04:07,730
but I also fed you. Hey, get
over there. Lay down. Go on.

69
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:11,180
Fucking think doesn't even
listen to me anymore. Go on.

70
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,180
I shouldn't be yelling at my
dog. My dogs is senior now.

71
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:19,660
She's eight and a half years old,
so she's officially a senior.

72
00:04:19,661 --> 00:04:23,800
So when I go and buy dog
food, I gotta buy, you know,

73
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:28,150
I got it by the advanced age
shit. You know the same stuff.

74
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:32,470
They're feed in your fucking Nana and
your granddad or whatever the fuck you

75
00:04:32,471 --> 00:04:37,240
know, putting them in a
fucking home. That's the worst.

76
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:39,940
That's the fucking worst man.

77
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:43,990
At least according to every fucking
movie or news report you see,

78
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:46,360
it's just like, this is
a wonderful facility.

79
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:50,230
They're going to be listening to Mitch
Miller the entire time they are here.

80
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:54,910
All of our facilities are
top notch. They're going to
be getting wonderful food.

81
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:58,900
They are in great care. You can
visit them whenever you want. Right?

82
00:04:58,901 --> 00:05:01,180
And then the fucking second,
you drive away. You know,

83
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:05,200
we fucking put a hard hat on your
grandmother and make her start doing some

84
00:05:05,201 --> 00:05:07,030
fucking yardwork. Isn't that how it works?

85
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:11,080
I'm trying to steal her pension or is
this just all some Hollywood drama shit?

86
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:13,390
I Dunno. Like I said,

87
00:05:13,391 --> 00:05:17,980
so I'm gonna have to tap out here
and then come back and about, um,

88
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:23,190
what a fuck is it in like nine minutes.

89
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:27,750
I want to go back out to the
fucking world of morning radio.

90
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:29,790
I literally had one of these
guys this morning, Cleo,

91
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:33,900
get over there and lay down. You
know, it's worried about this dog.

92
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:37,860
That thing won't shit unless I take
it down the street, which is great.

93
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:39,690
Is that what it is? You gotta take a shit?

94
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:43,090
Is that why you stare at me?

95
00:05:43,091 --> 00:05:46,090
Is that what you're trying to
communicate right now? Huh?

96
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:50,290
Like someone who's still sound of mine
but has lost the ability to speak.

97
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:54,640
This is like a Metallica video. Cleo.
Gee, stop fucking looking at me like that.

98
00:05:54,641 --> 00:05:56,980
I'm going to take you down the street.
All right buddy. I'm going to do it.

99
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:02,120
Fucking thing is staring
all through my head.

100
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:07,760
I just left you outside fucking
10 minutes. Why won't you go?

101
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:13,630
All right. This is going to
kill me. Okay. All right.

102
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:15,930
Well I'm going to be talking
to guys. We're not born there.

103
00:06:15,931 --> 00:06:20,330
My dog's taken a shit
evidently. Um, so anyways,

104
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:22,790
[inaudible] these morning
fucking radio guys are hilarious.

105
00:06:22,791 --> 00:06:26,270
They literally sit there and they go
like, uh, they'll just be talking to you.

106
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:29,170
A couple of them would like the
classic guys like just to clean up,

107
00:06:29,171 --> 00:06:32,390
get over there and laid out going.
Get over there. Get over there.

108
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:35,373
Alright.

109
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:39,310
I wish dogs understood. Just
give me five minutes. Clio,

110
00:06:39,311 --> 00:06:42,670
get the fuck over there. Lay down.

111
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:46,563
Okay.

112
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,710
I actually know what I think it is.

113
00:06:48,711 --> 00:06:51,410
I think she wants to get up on the
couch with me. This is fucking loose.

114
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:56,210
I have a pit bull in the, any sound
of wind. Wind freaks her the fuck out.

115
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,800
A Sasquatch could literally come into
my house and she'd be like, all right,

116
00:07:00,801 --> 00:07:02,150
let's fucking do this. Okay.

117
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,790
But if she hears a noise and she
can't see where it's coming from,

118
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:07,310
she just freaked the fuck out
right now I have the heat on.

119
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:10,520
I think that's bugging her and then
all of a sudden she becomes like this.

120
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:13,610
She turns into like a Chihuahua. You know,

121
00:07:13,611 --> 00:07:16,460
those dogs always look like they feed
in for something. Like, come on man.

122
00:07:16,461 --> 00:07:18,620
Just give me another hit, man.
She starts getting that look.

123
00:07:18,621 --> 00:07:23,030
She starts like she's not
shaking yet. Thank God. Um,

124
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:26,720
but anyways, a couple of these
morning djs with a classic,

125
00:07:26,721 --> 00:07:30,070
like they just taught like to call you
up, be like, hey bill, how you doing? Uh,

126
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:34,400
So-and-so from K, whatever. Believable,
blah, blah. Yeah. So listen,

127
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:37,310
we're going to be talking
here in about, uh,

128
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:40,050
about a minute coming out of this
commercial. Is there anything,

129
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:43,700
any subjects you want me to
hit on? Uh, and thing, uh,

130
00:07:43,701 --> 00:07:47,060
you want me to steer you towards I,
you know, whatever I'm talking about.

131
00:07:47,061 --> 00:07:49,610
I love, love La and he
is that guy. All right.

132
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,610
We'll be on a right at the end of this
break and then all of a sudden it just

133
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:53,603
goes,

134
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,350
wow. Yeah.

135
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,260
Alec Bode Bell Scalar that have

136
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:01,460
it. Also, you just like, dude,

137
00:08:01,461 --> 00:08:03,430
what happened to the guy I
was just fucking talking to

138
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:10,500
drab to add his age. 18.
We have a rough to add.

139
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,400
We got some laps coming your way.

140
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:13,580
Okay.

141
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:17,860
Cut. Went to the local Yuck, Yuck. Fuck,
fuck bond. We got bill, but have a lab.

142
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:20,000
Well, what's been on your mad?

143
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:25,420
Um, I almost said it to
the guy, be like, dude,

144
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:29,950
what happened to the guy I was just
talking to five minutes ago? Um,

145
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:32,260
other than that, the rest
of them have been fine.

146
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:35,230
I have no fucking idea what I'm doing
here. But anyways, I'm getting ready to,

147
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:40,370
I'm ready to, um, to do this tour here,
going through Canada. And uh, you know,

148
00:08:40,371 --> 00:08:42,280
I had those pick shows last week,

149
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:44,890
so I feel like I might have
been doing spots around town.

150
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:49,900
I'm fucking ready to go. I'm going
to be doing the treadmill by the way.

151
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:53,230
My Home Gym, the gym that
I'm going to have at home,

152
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:56,550
they're a [inaudible] doing the floor.

153
00:08:56,970 --> 00:09:01,720
It's a three day process
cause I got the fucking the,

154
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,070
what's it called? It's, I got the, it's
called the lava finish. Assam Shit.

155
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:08,370
I know. Stupid fucking name, but
it looks sick, man. It's fucking,

156
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:13,860
it's got to look shiny and clean,
exciting and new. Lift some weights

157
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:18,660
and become a shredded freckled con.

158
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,120
He's Bill Burke.

159
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:25,170
He's tired of looking like
a sack of mashed potatoes.

160
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,510
He's going to do some tips.

161
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:33,690
Walked down the street shirtless
and get sun poisoning. Um, yes.

162
00:09:33,691 --> 00:09:38,190
Everything's coming. So today, all the
gym shit is dropping off today. Right.

163
00:09:38,191 --> 00:09:40,650
Which was so fucking funny.
Cause today I'm going to leave.

164
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:44,280
So it's coming ups and they're
just like a, you know, basically,

165
00:09:44,281 --> 00:09:47,970
you know we're going to be there
sometime between 3:00 AM and 12 midnight.

166
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:51,720
Could you just try to be home in? Of
course I'm not going to be here now.

167
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:54,420
I got to tell the lovely Nia
and I was just like a sweetie,

168
00:09:54,421 --> 00:09:56,520
what did you have planned
tomorrow? She's like,

169
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:59,430
well I was going to go to the
show. I was like, cancel it.

170
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:06,450
She got so fucking mad at me.
[inaudible] all this stuff to do.

171
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:11,590
It's like it's one fucking day to have
a free gym for the rest of your life.

172
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:15,940
Okay. You're going to get to go
out there. You're going to listen.

173
00:10:15,941 --> 00:10:19,990
You're going to get to listen to your
music as opposed to the gyms. Music.

174
00:10:19,991 --> 00:10:22,060
Now I know that you can put headphones on,

175
00:10:22,061 --> 00:10:25,780
but every has those ear buds and the
fucking jamming in your ears and you're

176
00:10:25,781 --> 00:10:29,680
basically blowing out your ear drums,
giving yourself tinnitus or tetanus.

177
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:34,000
However the fuck you say it. Um,
cause you don't want to listen to, uh,

178
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:37,300
what's that song? They always play
a, we are soul to soul, right?

179
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:38,980
It takes two to make a thing go wrong.

180
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,160
You know,

181
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:44,300
they play that for some reason Jim
music stopped in the early nineties.

182
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:49,070
That girl is poison. They
don't even play shit like that.

183
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:51,080
Did they stay place?

184
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:53,910
I don't want to fall in love,

185
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:59,060
you know, like songs like he goes, is
that Banana Rama, Huda Gouda. Fuck,

186
00:10:59,061 --> 00:11:00,410
I remember this song,

187
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:03,590
you start thinking of the chick
you were dating at the time.

188
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,470
You start thinking about all
the fucking, all the time. Oh,

189
00:11:06,471 --> 00:11:09,140
who's getting who the chick you wanted
to date but didn't have the balls to,

190
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:13,010
so you hooked up with that fucking monster
who is working in customer service,

191
00:11:13,011 --> 00:11:16,220
right. To be a little
more accurate here. Um,

192
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:22,380
yeah, I, I don't like, uh, I'm not into
that shit. So anyways, so she has to,

193
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:26,090
she the poor things gotta be home all
day today. You know, with any luck,

194
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,430
it's actually between, like they said,

195
00:11:28,431 --> 00:11:31,850
between 10 30 or 10 and five or some shit.

196
00:11:31,851 --> 00:11:35,410
So hopefully I'm really
hoping that it's gonna. Um,

197
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:40,400
it's gonna come early, you
know what I mean? For the, uh,

198
00:11:40,401 --> 00:11:42,650
the amount of pouting that
she did about, you know,

199
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,090
you know what's so funny too,

200
00:11:44,091 --> 00:11:46,580
is whenever somebody says they can't
do something and they go, why, why,

201
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:49,040
what are you doing? And then they tell
you what to do and it's like, yeah,

202
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,990
you're not doing shit. You know,

203
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:55,030
cause you're so focused on what
you want them to do for you.

204
00:11:56,070 --> 00:11:59,730
It's just like, yeah, you know, I, I lost
my passport and somebody found his ID.

205
00:11:59,731 --> 00:12:04,270
He didn't do that tomorrow.
Yeah. I have a dialysis.

206
00:12:04,271 --> 00:12:07,600
I don't know if I told you I have,
you know, double kidney failure,

207
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:09,670
so I have to do it. If I
don't do this, I'm gonna die.

208
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:12,490
You can't put it off the
fucking eight hours for me.

209
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:14,763
Wait, come on.

210
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:20,310
It's kind of going into
that mode. Um, but anyways,

211
00:12:20,311 --> 00:12:22,410
Jesus Christ, who the fuck?
I don't even want to look.

212
00:12:22,411 --> 00:12:25,910
Who the fuck am I Bruins playing next?
It's funny when the Bruins are winning,

213
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:28,230
you know, kind of paying attention.
But whenever they were in trouble,

214
00:12:28,231 --> 00:12:31,530
that's when I fucking sit down and
watch because I'm a real fan. I'm the,

215
00:12:31,531 --> 00:12:32,790
I'm there during the bad times.

216
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,110
That's half the reason why I
watch so many games this year.

217
00:12:37,111 --> 00:12:40,380
I was just there going like, well,
they got rid of the whole fucking team.

218
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:44,610
You know, this is going to be a tough
year. So, all right, I'm going to see a,

219
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,990
I don't know. I'm a fucking nerd.
Like I watch, I like watching the,

220
00:12:47,991 --> 00:12:51,540
the rebuilding of a team
so you can be there.

221
00:12:51,541 --> 00:12:54,450
I remember when they brought that
guy up, dude, I fucking called it.

222
00:12:55,590 --> 00:13:00,090
How about the fucking filthy
flyers? They all the capitals.

223
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:02,950
Hey, capital fans,

224
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:07,520
you guys finally gonna fucking push
through a you east coast San Jose Sharks.

225
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:11,420
You ever gonna make the fucking finals?
Can you do that for your God damn fans?

226
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:16,700
Huh? Um, all right, let's look
up the Bruins here. Scores, news,

227
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:22,130
video stats, standing schedules, players.
Fuck are the teams teams. There we go.

228
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,010
Oh by the way, I've been
going onto that French site.

229
00:13:25,011 --> 00:13:28,580
I've been figuring shit out.
Um, I'm sticking with the dude.

230
00:13:28,581 --> 00:13:31,760
I'm like 33 33 days in here. Alright,

231
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:36,440
watch episode 12 during
an off day in California.

232
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:43,740
Well the hell is this guy frank
for Trento and the Bruins.

233
00:13:43,801 --> 00:13:46,320
Rookies explore La. Oh,

234
00:13:46,321 --> 00:13:51,210
rough stretch of the ice improves
with a win over the leafs.

235
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:52,171
Why?

236
00:13:52,171 --> 00:13:56,100
I don't understand watching these fucking
soap operas about your Goddamn teams,

237
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:59,580
you know, behind enemy lines or whatever
the fuck they were always doing.

238
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:01,410
What do they do that in the NFL?

239
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:03,250
Okay.

240
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:07,300
You know, jockish what is somethings
like unnecessary roughness,

241
00:14:07,301 --> 00:14:08,920
what do they call it?
What does that thing,

242
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:12,640
that fucking thing they do on
HBO where Rex Ryan's like, Hey,

243
00:14:12,641 --> 00:14:15,100
we'll beat any fucking team
and it's fucking league.

244
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:19,930
You know that he gets fired a fuck.

245
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:25,180
Our next game is tomorrow
night it gets to St Louis Blues

246
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:29,820
and then on Monday we play
the fucking Blackhawks.

247
00:14:29,821 --> 00:14:31,830
Both of those are away games.

248
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,950
Then we have the hurricanes,

249
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:38,400
then we have the Redwings
and then we have Ottawa.

250
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,610
Fuck yeah,

251
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:47,790
this is fucking unbelievable. Are We?
Are we going to blow this? Oh wait,

252
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,830
what the fuck was that story
about what we got there?

253
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:55,100
What we go here. This is some rookie.

254
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:57,830
Why can't you fast forward
your way through the Goddamn,

255
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:03,740
I don't want to watch episode 12 of
rookie sitting on a fucking beach in La

256
00:15:03,741 --> 00:15:05,480
talking about hockey. I don't give a shit.

257
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:10,700
I thought they was showing me some new
prospect that Bruins have. God knows,

258
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:15,140
but bring them up. We could use
them. Ninth annual cuts for a cause.

259
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:20,060
Everybody gets say head shaved
and hopefully at least you know,

260
00:15:20,061 --> 00:15:24,020
half of one half of 1% will actually
go to the fucking cause through what?

261
00:15:24,021 --> 00:15:28,850
I'm so down on every goddamn
charity now. That'd be fun. I mean,

262
00:15:28,851 --> 00:15:31,730
I have to be honest with you. I've done
charities my entire fucking career,

263
00:15:31,731 --> 00:15:36,400
but I have never seen just the
sheer number of charity. Oh,

264
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:41,450
there it is. Hey, all right. Going
to call you back. Talk to you.

265
00:15:41,451 --> 00:15:45,170
In a minute. All right. I'm back.

266
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:47,600
Just knocked out another
two and I am done.

267
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:50,060
Probably talk politics
too much on that last one.

268
00:15:50,061 --> 00:15:54,170
Everybody wants to talk politics.
I got Sally and Bella. Yeah.

269
00:15:54,171 --> 00:15:56,900
That with all this stuff,
let's go out and politics.

270
00:15:57,020 --> 00:16:00,950
There's gonna be a great solidly
Uncle Bait. It's like, yeah, no,

271
00:16:00,951 --> 00:16:04,160
it really isn't. And
this one for some reason

272
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:10,280
is depressed the shit out of me.
You know what I mean? Jesus Christ,

273
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,730
eh? It's just, you know,
I'll tell you right now,

274
00:16:13,731 --> 00:16:17,660
you can take that Donald Trump. You
can want him up in a ball. Okay?

275
00:16:17,661 --> 00:16:19,580
You sticking right up.
You know who's who? Huh?

276
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:23,510
You roll her down the street into
the fucking garbage bin. All right?

277
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:27,200
And then you fucking, then you
gotta take Bernie Sanders, right?

278
00:16:27,201 --> 00:16:30,410
And you've got to give
him that gun that fucking

279
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:34,250
Scarface had at the end
of the fucking movie.

280
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:36,380
And then you just gotta
send him in. You know,

281
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:41,810
you got to send them into one of those
banker fucking meetings and he just comes

282
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,520
it when, if know when they're doing the,

283
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:48,620
the annual international
bankers slash family picnic,

284
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:53,750
right? So you've got everybody
there, you've got the evil cuts,

285
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:58,250
and then you have the spawn of the evil
cuts and you just got to go in there.

286
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:00,830
I mean, even then, right?
What are you going to do?

287
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:05,570
Let's just say we buy into the fairytale
that everybody who's super fucking rich

288
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:10,070
is fucking evil. And then regular
people were fucking good people.

289
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,550
What will, you know? Then we'll
have their level of power,

290
00:17:13,551 --> 00:17:17,330
then we move up and then we become
them, right? And then, you know,

291
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:19,670
you know it's going to happen. You're
going to be here, you're gonna have power.

292
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:23,540
You're gonna have influence
here. Come though, right?

293
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:28,310
Did it come the whores? It comes to
temptation. There's the pile of gold.

294
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:32,270
You're supposed to be watching
for everybody else. You know,

295
00:17:32,271 --> 00:17:35,450
you could do the right thing or
you could go out and get yourself.

296
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:37,940
You fucking Bentley, you Lamborghini,

297
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:42,050
you could stay with your wife or you
could start banging at 22 year old

298
00:17:42,051 --> 00:17:46,850
Victoria's secret model.
You know, decisions. Yeah.

299
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:50,520
Becomes tough. You know, and it did this,

300
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:52,650
it's like an earthquake when
the earth splits, right?

301
00:17:52,651 --> 00:17:56,970
And your morals are on one side and all
the whores in the gold are on the other

302
00:17:56,971 --> 00:17:59,550
and it's very hard. You know,
you gotta jump over early,

303
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,570
jump over early or it get you, you go,

304
00:18:03,571 --> 00:18:06,510
you go too far down and then
it's just, what can you tell?

305
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:09,840
You're just caught up in it if
fucking caught up in it, you know?

306
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:14,840
And that's when I actually feel lucky to
be a balding red headed fuck because it

307
00:18:15,181 --> 00:18:19,980
really keeps me in check. So sad. Um,

308
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:23,130
anyway, so let me do a
little fucking read here. Um,

309
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:27,720
what's the last time there was
a balding headed fuck you know,

310
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,830
of any influence, you know,
I think it's high time.

311
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:36,540
Balding redheaded. Fuck. Got a chance
to drive the bus, Huh? All right,

348
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:19,320
You know,

349
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:23,850
he used to be a wolf and you had to
sleep outside trying to find a spot that

350
00:21:23,851 --> 00:21:26,760
didn't have acorns underneath
you tell you this dog,

351
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,760
its fucking thing has no respect. Um,

352
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,090
I thought it had to go to the
bathroom. It doesn't cause I actually,

353
00:21:33,091 --> 00:21:34,480
during that, uh, radio interview,

354
00:21:34,481 --> 00:21:37,590
I went outside and she took a big dump
in my backyard that I now have to go pick

355
00:21:37,591 --> 00:21:42,510
up with a plastic bag. Cause that's,
that's what a man does in 20 fucking 16.

356
00:21:42,511 --> 00:21:45,660
Right. So now I realized that she
just wants to come up on the couch.

357
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:49,830
She's always scared. Right. You know what?

358
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:52,800
I know there's so many fucking dog lovers
out there right now then. You know,

359
00:21:52,801 --> 00:21:55,680
nothing would make you feel better
than if I fucking brought her up here.

360
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:59,190
All right, come on CLIA. Come
here. Come on buddy. Come on.

361
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:03,030
Dog trainer would be pissed right
now. You gave into her. All right.

362
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:08,400
There you go. See that? Look at you snug
like a bug in the rug. Now you're fine,

363
00:22:08,401 --> 00:22:12,900
right? All right, good kid. Um,

364
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:17,010
anyways, yeah, Jesus Christ. That's
all people want to talk about.

365
00:22:17,011 --> 00:22:18,990
They just want to fucking talk
about politics. And I go, Hey,

366
00:22:18,991 --> 00:22:21,450
I don't want to talk politics.
I'm not paying attention.

367
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:25,020
I don't know what I'm talking about. I
don't like, I don't like any of them.

368
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:28,360
And then everybody just, I, yeah. You
know? Yeah, but don't you take it,

369
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:32,280
you think it's all really just
talking about Trump and being like,

370
00:22:32,281 --> 00:22:35,520
can you fucking believe this guy is
still doing it? Nobody Talks Hillary.

371
00:22:35,521 --> 00:22:39,570
Nobody talks Bernie Sanders.
Huh? Is he related to the uh,

372
00:22:39,571 --> 00:22:43,260
the chicken guy there? He's
Kinda got the same hair.

373
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,540
He's either that or the
fucking the oats guy. Right.

374
00:22:45,541 --> 00:22:48,510
One of the other is those nice
too fucking hacky references.

375
00:22:48,511 --> 00:22:52,260
Did you enjoy those now Jesus,
I got to go to the airport.

376
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:55,050
I have not even packed and I still
have eight more fucking minutes.

377
00:22:55,051 --> 00:22:57,510
I got a needy pit bull
sitting in my fucking lap.

378
00:22:57,540 --> 00:23:02,210
I have to some out eat and not
become a fat fuck today. You know,

379
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:05,160
I think I'm going to do, I'm going to
pack a lunch like a goddamn second grader.

380
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:07,980
I'm going to make a peanut butter and
jelly sandwich with some cheese and

381
00:23:07,981 --> 00:23:10,080
crackers and like an apple, you know,

382
00:23:10,081 --> 00:23:15,081
and as much as all these fucking weird
looking shredded 50 year olds that are

383
00:23:15,481 --> 00:23:16,620
spray tanned out there,

384
00:23:16,621 --> 00:23:18,750
you know those people and they've
gotten their first fucking a,

385
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:19,800
can you tuck the, uh,

386
00:23:19,801 --> 00:23:23,850
the parachute under my Chin behind my
years they've had that fucking procedure,

387
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:27,510
you know, so they still have the a
heart monitor forehead, you know,

388
00:23:27,511 --> 00:23:31,920
with the lines going across it. But
then like their fucking neck, you know,

389
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:35,910
they're looking like a WHO's who is
a classic fucking, just got a great,

390
00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:40,110
AH, Jesus Christ. I don't know
any of the fucking act, you know,

391
00:23:40,111 --> 00:23:44,550
class to the actor face. You know what
I mean? Judge shutting out confidently.

392
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:48,830
You know the jet black
fucking hair, right?

393
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:54,650
He used to dance in the fountain on
friends. You know, now you're on OJ.

394
00:23:55,370 --> 00:23:59,560
My wife's been watching the shit out of
that thing. Huh? I can't get into it.

395
00:23:59,561 --> 00:24:02,440
You know, I can't get too into it cause
I already know what happens. It's like,

396
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:05,560
yes, spoiler alert. He's,
he's found not guilty.

397
00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:13,840
I watched the first one just cause I want
to see them dramatize whatever he was

398
00:24:13,841 --> 00:24:16,690
doing in the back of the
Bronco. And I can't, I tell you,

399
00:24:16,691 --> 00:24:19,930
as much as the tragedy happens,
whenever I see clips of that,

400
00:24:19,931 --> 00:24:24,100
it always makes me think like, dude,
I would love a white full size bronco.

401
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,850
That's such a bad ass
vehicle. It's big, it's safe.

402
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:29,230
You know what's great about those,

403
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:33,070
those full sized Broncos
back in the day was the a,

404
00:24:33,071 --> 00:24:35,100
I've talked about this before.
What do you call the, the,

405
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:40,120
the middle area between the front two
bucket bucket seats or captains chairs,

406
00:24:40,121 --> 00:24:42,880
I believe they used to call them. Um,

407
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:46,780
what I loved about the console there in
the middle, when you open that thing up,

408
00:24:46,781 --> 00:24:49,120
that was big enough that
if you insulated it,

409
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:53,470
you could throw ice in there and have
a 12 pack of Budweiser. You know,

410
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:59,060
they make it so hard to drink
and drive and enjoy yourself.

411
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:04,400
You know, nowadays, back in the day,
if you had a big truck like that, okay.

412
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:04,970
You know, your,

413
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:08,660
your biggest problem was how am I
gonna What Am I gonna pee into while I

414
00:25:08,661 --> 00:25:12,980
continued driving down the street,
taking everybody's life into my hands.

415
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,410
You know, I shouldn't even say that.

416
00:25:15,411 --> 00:25:17,810
A friend of mine got fucking hit by
a drunk driver and I ain't doing like

417
00:25:17,811 --> 00:25:21,230
fucking 90. Her Damn car looked
like it was torn in half.

418
00:25:21,231 --> 00:25:23,450
And I got to tell you the way they
make these fucking cars nowadays,

419
00:25:23,451 --> 00:25:25,760
it's amazing. Oh, by the way.

420
00:25:25,761 --> 00:25:28,970
So I found more information
on the 27 Lincoln Continental.

421
00:25:28,971 --> 00:25:33,800
Evidently it's going to start at like,
like 45 grand or something like that.

422
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:38,120
They're trying to take out the Mercedes
Benz e-class and rather than going

423
00:25:38,121 --> 00:25:42,320
performance and that they're trying to
go elegance. Like we're a little more,

424
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:46,460
you know, you ride on a cloud over
here as opposed to the, Whoa, Whoa,

425
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:51,080
I have a fucking Mercedes-Benz. I don't
know if that's the right way to go.

426
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:55,510
But, um, I also talked to the guy who, um,

427
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:01,870
who rebuilt my truck, um,
and I, I called him up.

428
00:26:01,871 --> 00:26:04,120
I said, hey, this is the prototype,

429
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:07,920
the concept card has the suicide
doors. He goes, oh my God,

430
00:26:07,921 --> 00:26:10,950
that looks fucking sick and all
that type of shit. And I go,

431
00:26:10,951 --> 00:26:13,020
they're not making them that
way. He goes, I was like,

432
00:26:13,021 --> 00:26:15,450
can you do if I buy this
car and I ship it to you,

433
00:26:15,451 --> 00:26:19,050
can you fucking put suicide doors
in it? He goes, I got it. You know,

434
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,790
he had to look it up. He said, basically,

435
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:25,500
you're making the car a lot more unsafe.
You're weakening the overall frame.

436
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:29,490
When you take out that middle piece,
that's between the front and the second,

437
00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:34,740
uh, in the back door, the B frame, fucking
post, whatever the fuck he called it.

438
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:38,550
Um, and I'm thinking like, you know
what, I haven't been in an accident.

439
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:43,410
You know, I drive like a fucking old
man. I can take out the middle fucking

440
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,110
the B beam post fucking thing,
whatever the fuck you call it. Right.

441
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:52,620
You know, I feel like it's like, you
know, when you have to get a permit,

442
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:55,860
like you can knock down a wall yourself
in your house and interior wall,

443
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,870
as long as it's not a load bearing wall.

444
00:26:57,871 --> 00:27:01,500
I feel like that's what I would
be knocking out on my continental.

445
00:27:01,501 --> 00:27:05,580
So then I would have like this,
the suicide doors, led lights,

446
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,020
that thing would look fucking sick.

447
00:27:07,021 --> 00:27:10,740
And then I would like rear end a smart
car and I'd go through the fucking

448
00:27:10,741 --> 00:27:11,574
windshield,

449
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:17,700
or I'd just go into a spin and I'd
be objected out. Those two food,

450
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:21,870
those two like cool
doors. So, um, I dunno,

451
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:26,010
you would think this day and
age if they, if they want it to,

452
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:30,600
is that way suicide doors went away
where they considered not safe.

453
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:35,630
I learned that doing the
Seinfeld comedians in cars
where I asked him two times,

454
00:27:36,511 --> 00:27:41,040
like an idiot. I go, why can't they make
cars that look cool like this anymore?

455
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:42,660
And he basically answered saying,

456
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:47,661
because of the safety regulations are so
strict that they're basically basically

457
00:27:48,091 --> 00:27:52,680
creating in such a small
space, all of them, um,

458
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:54,930
that they're all gonna
kind of look the same.

459
00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:58,850
And then we saw another car and I said,
look at that thing. I was like, why?

460
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:03,630
Why can't they, why can't they make cars
like that anymore? And Jerry just went,

461
00:28:04,170 --> 00:28:09,060
I already answered that question.
It felt like such a fucking dope.

462
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:12,780
Um, anyways, so, you know,

463
00:28:12,781 --> 00:28:16,150
it's funny as I just talked to some
people on the radio in St Louis and uh,

464
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:16,993
I was telling them how,

465
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:21,240
how much I was not looking forward to
watching my team having to try to get a

466
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:25,620
point or two off of them that's coming
up Friday. And uh, they were like, well,

467
00:28:25,621 --> 00:28:28,460
you know, who knows, maybe
when you come out here,

468
00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:31,920
St Louis will be in the playoffs,
she can go to a game. And I was like,

469
00:28:31,921 --> 00:28:36,060
that was the one happy hockey
thought I've had in the last,

470
00:28:36,061 --> 00:28:37,140
I'm not going to lie to you like I was,

471
00:28:37,141 --> 00:28:40,140
I've been so busy that I didn't even
notice like the first three games that we

472
00:28:40,141 --> 00:28:44,340
lost. Um, and also like I wasn't,

473
00:28:44,341 --> 00:28:45,870
I'm not one of those guys
that looks at the standings.

474
00:28:45,871 --> 00:28:49,200
I just knew we were three seats. I'm
like, all right, so we're in, I'll watch,

475
00:28:49,201 --> 00:28:49,381
you know,

476
00:28:49,381 --> 00:28:53,070
as many games as I can towards the end
of the season and I'll enjoy us the first

477
00:28:53,071 --> 00:28:56,550
round of the playoffs, I'm going to
be sitting there, right. My Budweiser,

478
00:28:56,551 --> 00:28:59,190
my little shorty there, right. A
little fucking thing at Jamieson,

479
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:02,730
they have one of those up period. Right.
So by the end of it, I'm either like,

480
00:29:02,731 --> 00:29:06,480
you know, happy that we won or I
just passed out drunk. You know,

481
00:29:06,481 --> 00:29:07,650
if we start to lose the game,

482
00:29:07,651 --> 00:29:11,850
then I do two to Budweisers and
two Jameson's in the third period.

483
00:29:11,851 --> 00:29:12,271
Then you just,

484
00:29:12,271 --> 00:29:15,510
you fall asleep and the next day you
wake up and you're so fucking hung over,

485
00:29:15,511 --> 00:29:16,950
you don't give a shit that you lost.

486
00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:20,160
You just trying to get yourself
physically back to where you need to be.

487
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:25,170
That's how I do it. That's the way an
alcoholic doesn't. I don't do that. Okay.

488
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:29,370
You fucking literal cuts. Why
would somebody do something
like that? So anyways,

489
00:29:29,371 --> 00:29:33,450
I am going to be in
Wednesday, tomorrow night. Oh,

490
00:29:33,451 --> 00:29:35,970
let me read the dates to wrap
up the podcast here. Well,

491
00:29:35,971 --> 00:29:40,410
the first half of it before we then
listened to some Andrew [inaudible] mood

492
00:29:40,411 --> 00:29:44,560
music and then we move into
some of the classic stuff, um,

493
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:49,540
from back in the day from
podcasting back in yesteryear.

494
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:53,920
All right, so I'm going to be
at the coliseum. It's seizes,

495
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:58,210
doesn't that sound impressive?
It's probably a 40 seat room. Um,

496
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:02,050
I'm going to be there. Uh,
tomorrow night, April 1st. Oh,

497
00:30:02,051 --> 00:30:05,020
April falls, April 2nd.

498
00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:09,520
I'm going to be at the Casino
Roma in Ramah, Ontario.

499
00:30:09,521 --> 00:30:14,500
Wherever the fuck that is that I'm going
to be at TD placed stadium in Ottawa,

500
00:30:14,501 --> 00:30:15,430
Ontario.

501
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:21,580
And then I'm doing the lol festival
in sub Sudbury Arena Ontario,

502
00:30:21,581 --> 00:30:26,170
which is actually a, uh, it's
a minor league hockey arena.

503
00:30:26,290 --> 00:30:30,250
The way they, you know, they set it up
so you can still do standup in it too.

504
00:30:30,251 --> 00:30:33,490
I'm not like fucking center ice.
It's not get crazy here. Huh.

505
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:37,690
And then later on this month,
the 22nd 23rd and 24th of April,

506
00:30:37,691 --> 00:30:41,530
I'm going to be doing a run St Louis,
Missouri, Kansas City, Missouri in Ames,

507
00:30:41,531 --> 00:30:42,040
Iowa.

508
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:46,180
I have not been to Iowa since I did the
rich bitch tour with Charlie Murphy and

509
00:30:46,990 --> 00:30:48,010
Darnell Rawlings way back in the day.

510
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:51,370
And I believe we did one of
the penguins comedy clubs.

511
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:56,350
And that's the last time I was there.
I am so excited to go to Iowa in April.

512
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:58,380
I've never,

513
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:02,400
the only time I've ever been to Iowa has
always been the dead of fucking winter.

514
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:04,680
And all the crops are cut down.

515
00:31:04,681 --> 00:31:07,200
And it's like you're walking
on the surface of the moon.

516
00:31:08,010 --> 00:31:11,610
It's overcast and all of that. And I told
you for the longest time, I was like,

517
00:31:11,611 --> 00:31:15,450
how did slip not come from out
here? Like my idea, I should say,

518
00:31:15,451 --> 00:31:18,480
of what Iowa was, you
know, just, you know,

519
00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:22,000
beautiful pony tailed girls
running through fucking,

520
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:23,553
uh,

521
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:27,900
fucking stocks of corn. You know, if
their flannel shirts tied off going,

522
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:32,220
hey yo Galen, you know, I'm just
the girl next door does everything.

523
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:34,790
They got a southern accent, you
know, apple pies in the window.

524
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:38,380
Like that's what I pictured. And then
you get there and you're like, oh my God,

525
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:43,410
this is what Armageddon looks
like going to fucking Iowa in

526
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,740
the middle of January and
February. I'm telling you,

527
00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:50,550
you've never seen anything like
all the crops are cut down.

528
00:31:50,551 --> 00:31:55,050
The gray sky meets the baron
earth and you're like, I get it.

529
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,330
I get slipknot, I get math,

530
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:02,240
I understand madness. I get
this. This is fucking insane.

531
00:32:02,241 --> 00:32:05,300
So I'm so excited to go there and
actually see it when it's lush.

532
00:32:05,810 --> 00:32:09,350
And I watched like, wow, these people
feed the country. I want to see that.

533
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:14,360
All right. So anyways, looking
forward to that. Um, anyways,

534
00:32:14,361 --> 00:32:17,120
so that is the podcast. Can I say
anyways one more fucking time?

535
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:21,230
That is the podcast. Uh,
thank you guys for listening.

536
00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:25,440
Have a wonderful weekend. Yukons and
I will talk to you on Monday and um,

537
00:32:25,490 --> 00:32:28,040
thank you to everybody that's going to
come out to the shows here in Canada.

538
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:29,270
Okay. All right. I'll see you

539
00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:40,743
[inaudible]

540
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:26,720
who's at big going on on a Minnesota
with that weird last name that has like

541
00:33:27,690 --> 00:33:32,470
three letter bs and an n in it or some
shit. I don't fucking know. Anyway,

542
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:33,900
let's plow ahead with the podcast.

543
00:33:33,901 --> 00:33:35,820
This is the Monday morning
podcast for Monday,

544
00:33:35,821 --> 00:33:39,750
March 1st a that aunties door and um,

545
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:44,940
yeah, I had a hell of a fucking
weekend out there in Houston, Texas.

546
00:33:44,941 --> 00:33:48,090
I want to thank everybody who
came out to the Improv and um,

547
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:52,170
I had great shows Friday night that led
into Saturday night and Saturday night.

548
00:33:52,171 --> 00:33:56,790
I think I might've had two of the best
shows I've had in recent memory. Um,

549
00:33:57,270 --> 00:34:01,320
they would just, everything
sort of clicked. I kind of,

550
00:34:01,321 --> 00:34:06,060
I was sitting in this
restaurant, um, eh, this is,

551
00:34:06,061 --> 00:34:08,010
this is how clean living I am. Okay.

552
00:34:08,011 --> 00:34:13,011
It's right before 7:00 AM I have been a
salad with fucking a chicken breast in

553
00:34:13,621 --> 00:34:18,240
it. Right. I got my laptop. I'm typing
out this fucking script, finishing it up,

554
00:34:18,241 --> 00:34:21,630
drinking a glass of water,
getting the shit out of the way.

555
00:34:21,930 --> 00:34:24,510
And I just remember like
having this feeling like this,

556
00:34:24,511 --> 00:34:28,110
this is what Tony Robbins does. You know,

557
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:30,510
that's how he has that fucking psycho.

558
00:34:30,990 --> 00:34:35,680
Terminally happy fucking smile
on his face, you know? And um,

559
00:34:36,990 --> 00:34:38,610
I don't know. I realized
some shit in that moment.

560
00:34:38,611 --> 00:34:40,100
I brought it to stage and started riffing.

561
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:42,720
The whole fucking thing
worked and I recorded it.

562
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:47,430
But the beautiful thing about the
universe is when you hit something great

563
00:34:47,431 --> 00:34:50,310
happens, something else
has to balance it out.

564
00:34:50,311 --> 00:34:55,050
Like I get to see Peyton manning fuck
up the Superbowl and thus make me feel

565
00:34:55,051 --> 00:34:57,390
vindicated. And then two weeks later,

566
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:01,320
a crushing fucking overtime loss.
It wasn't crushing cause they used,

567
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:04,170
they used to beat us by fucking,
these will be this like seven to one.

568
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:08,100
All right, you got to admit,
okay, you can hit a Fox.

569
00:35:08,101 --> 00:35:11,190
Remember that back in the day it
was a joke. Our hockey was a joke.

570
00:35:11,191 --> 00:35:13,650
First of all, 90% of the people in
the league were all from Canada.

571
00:35:13,651 --> 00:35:17,280
Granted there were only six
fucking teams, but still, um,

572
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:21,570
and you guys used to crush us and now
we're breathing down your neck and you

573
00:35:21,571 --> 00:35:22,650
better enjoy that gold medal.

574
00:35:22,770 --> 00:35:25,550
Cause I got a feeling that's the last
one you're going to be fucking having for

575
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:29,910
awhile. How do you like that? Huh? Nah,
you wait till fucking next year buddy.

576
00:35:30,690 --> 00:35:35,100
Now can you guys handle that
shit talk and all right. Anyways,

577
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:39,420
so twice this, I had incidents
with people in the crowd.

578
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:44,940
Um, and both of them were women. And uh,

579
00:35:44,941 --> 00:35:47,850
I'm the first to tell you that I do have
fucking issues with women, but the, uh,

580
00:35:47,851 --> 00:35:52,320
the first night, um, I was on stage
and there was this woman right down.

581
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:55,890
I don't know if it's stage left to
stage right from where I'm fucking at at

582
00:35:55,891 --> 00:35:58,190
stage left. All right?

583
00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:01,020
So I think that's the proper terminology.

584
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:03,930
Why the fuck do you guys need
to know stage left stage, right?

585
00:36:03,931 --> 00:36:08,190
You're in the crowd. You
know, I go down to midas.

586
00:36:08,191 --> 00:36:10,830
Do I need to know what fucking wrench
they're gonna use? I don't need, okay,

587
00:36:10,831 --> 00:36:15,000
so stage left. All right, I'm looking
down and, uh, this fucking girl is, she's,

588
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:18,660
you know, she's talking,
continue on with my jokes.

589
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:23,460
It looked down and she still talking.
So finally I say, hey, it is sweet tits.

590
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:27,810
Why don't you, uh, what's the
problem? What are you talking about?

591
00:36:27,811 --> 00:36:31,200
And then she does the
usual, hey ma, you know,

592
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:34,590
I wouldn't say she was attractive.
If she was in from a small town,

593
00:36:34,790 --> 00:36:39,000
she'd be a Hottie, you know,
just out of percentages. But, um,

594
00:36:39,090 --> 00:36:41,240
so she did the usual
like, what, what I have a,

595
00:36:41,241 --> 00:36:45,360
I have no idea what the fuck I'm doing.
You know, 10 minutes later I look back,

596
00:36:45,361 --> 00:36:48,000
she's still fucking talking.
It gets a little more heated.

597
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:52,200
I basically went to her table about six
times until I finally told her to shut

598
00:36:52,201 --> 00:36:56,460
the fuck up and then I don't really even
fucking remember. Then all of a sudden,

599
00:36:56,490 --> 00:36:57,121
next thing you know,

600
00:36:57,121 --> 00:37:00,630
she's hammered and she's getting kicked
out when I got like five minutes left in

601
00:37:00,631 --> 00:37:04,620
my show. So she threatened to sue the
place and all this type of shit. Now,

602
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:07,830
usually that's the end
of the night. You know,

603
00:37:08,010 --> 00:37:11,850
the whole crowd is fucking clapping as
she's leaving because she's been fucking

604
00:37:11,851 --> 00:37:15,750
annoying. Everybody around
them who paid to see the show.

605
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:19,950
All right, so a, usually
that's the end of it.

606
00:37:19,951 --> 00:37:21,240
But you know what this psycho did.

607
00:37:21,270 --> 00:37:26,270
She actually sent a letter to the
Improv and she tried to pretend that she

608
00:37:28,290 --> 00:37:29,101
wasn't herself.

609
00:37:29,101 --> 00:37:33,360
She tried to pretend that she was an
impartial member of the audience who

610
00:37:33,361 --> 00:37:37,740
completely agreed with her and thought
that I was a fucking idiot. So, uh,

611
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:41,430
I want to read you a little bit
of this fucking letter here. Um,

612
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,900
to whom it may concern,

613
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:47,930
I attended bill burrs first show on Friday
the 26th and was utterly appalled by

614
00:37:49,471 --> 00:37:52,080
his performance. I love comedy. Oh,

615
00:37:52,081 --> 00:37:55,620
this is what you always have
to do whenever you bitch. Um,

616
00:37:55,950 --> 00:37:57,210
and you're not there in person,

617
00:37:57,211 --> 00:37:59,700
so they can't see what a
radiant human being you are.

618
00:37:59,850 --> 00:38:02,070
You have to then after
you state your bitch,

619
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:06,760
you then have to fucking
show how easygoing you are
as a human being. So anyway,

620
00:38:06,761 --> 00:38:10,110
she saw my show. She was utterly
appalled by it, by my performance,

621
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:14,310
and then she goes, I love comedy and I
certainly expect there to be rudeness,

622
00:38:14,490 --> 00:38:17,760
crudity and what can be offensive topics.

623
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,650
That's what comedy is all about.
It makes it fun. That being said,

624
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:23,011
okay,

625
00:38:23,011 --> 00:38:26,880
now she's established how fucking cool
and laid back she is back to trash and

626
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:29,940
old fucking heavy duty. Here
she goes. That being said,

627
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:34,410
Bill Bird took it way too far and he was
quite unprofessional to say the least.

628
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:38,860
While there was indeed quite
a lot to laugh at. Yeah,

629
00:38:38,861 --> 00:38:41,740
that was the part where you were
sober, your fucking lightweight.

630
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:45,820
That was the beginning of the show
when you weren't fucking on your ninth

631
00:38:45,821 --> 00:38:49,660
fucking drink and you actually paying
attention to the show. So yeah,

632
00:38:49,661 --> 00:38:53,860
initially there was indeed quite a lot
to laugh at and I think this person is

633
00:38:53,861 --> 00:38:57,880
trying to write as if it's medieval times
and I should be like fucking holding

634
00:38:57,881 --> 00:39:00,730
this thing like a goddamn scroll.
I know that isn't mean evil ish,

635
00:39:00,731 --> 00:39:02,740
but she's used, she's
doing that biblical thing.

636
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:06,280
What she's using extra fucking words
to try to sound intelligent. Well,

637
00:39:06,281 --> 00:39:09,880
initially there was indeed quite
a lot to laugh at instead of me.

638
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,990
At first it was funny. Um,
anyways, the show ended up,

639
00:39:13,991 --> 00:39:18,730
the show ended up being a complete
disappointment. Okay for it. Okay.

640
00:39:18,731 --> 00:39:22,120
This is our complaint here for at
least 30 minutes. He, blasphemy,

641
00:39:22,210 --> 00:39:24,940
God and the name of Jesus Christ.

642
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:28,270
He outright degraded the
Catholic religion. All right.

643
00:39:28,390 --> 00:39:32,380
Now that's complete bullshit.
I only blessed to meet God,

644
00:39:32,530 --> 00:39:36,280
the name of Jesus Christ and the Catholic
religion for about seven minutes.

645
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:40,210
30 minutes. What am I
fucking George Carlin.

646
00:39:40,270 --> 00:39:42,040
I can't talk about
anything but 30 minutes.

647
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:45,190
Maybe you weren't so fucking
hammered. You dumb cunt. You know,

648
00:39:45,191 --> 00:39:48,640
you'd have a better perception of,
of, of how much time had elapsed.

649
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:54,920
Oh Jesus. All right, let's
continue. Although I'll get this.

650
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:56,670
This isn't another thing.
Another thing was she's,

651
00:39:56,680 --> 00:40:00,180
she's pulling this move again. He
outright degraded the Catholic religion,

652
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:04,320
although I do not belong to this
religion. So now you supposed to be like,

653
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:07,560
wow, she's not even part of that religion.

654
00:40:07,950 --> 00:40:11,310
And even she found it offensive.
Have you guys picked up on that?

655
00:40:11,311 --> 00:40:15,620
On Youtube at all? Like when
someone wants to trash Obama, um,

656
00:40:15,690 --> 00:40:18,360
they'll say like a Bama is
the worst president ever.

657
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:21,420
And then they'll write and
I'm a Democrat, you know,

658
00:40:21,421 --> 00:40:22,980
like you can prove it either way.

659
00:40:23,250 --> 00:40:26,220
Just trying to cut people off the
past before they go, fuck you,

660
00:40:26,221 --> 00:40:29,550
you Fox News watching right
wing, whatever, you know.

661
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:31,100
Yeah.

662
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:34,850
Women need to shut the fuck up. And
I'm a girl, that dumb shits. Okay.

663
00:40:34,851 --> 00:40:38,090
So evidently she was, she was
offended and she's not even a,

664
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,350
she's not even Catholic anyway,

665
00:40:39,351 --> 00:40:44,351
she said it was offensive and
what he said went on and on again,

666
00:40:45,051 --> 00:40:47,960
while this type of thing
should be accept a expected,

667
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:53,200
he took it way too far and there was a
young lady who like I and my friends was

668
00:40:54,981 --> 00:40:58,760
becoming offended. Yeah, of
course she was because she's you,

669
00:40:58,930 --> 00:41:02,960
you fucking psycho. Can you believe
that? She thinks I'm this fucking stupid.

670
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:06,350
I don't know what this point is.
Probably not obvious to you guys,

671
00:41:06,351 --> 00:41:08,060
but wait till I finish the
rest of this. All right.

672
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:10,760
I'm probably going to sound like some
maniac here, but I don't give a fuck.

673
00:41:11,270 --> 00:41:11,750
I said,

674
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:15,680
there was a young lady who like I and my
friends was becoming offended and said

675
00:41:15,681 --> 00:41:19,550
a few words instead a few
words to someone at our table,

676
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:24,890
you fucking lie and sack
a Twat. Anyways, a she,

677
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:28,610
he said when he rudely addressed
her, that's when I said a lady,

678
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:31,310
I guess lady is rude. Hey Lady,

679
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:35,720
could you do me a favor and look
at the show at some point? Um,

680
00:41:35,870 --> 00:41:38,990
he said when he rudely addressed her,
she told him that she was Catholic.

681
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:42,800
That never happened. He had no
apologies or considerations.

682
00:41:43,010 --> 00:41:47,520
Just utter disrespect. Okay.
First of all, she never said that.

683
00:41:47,570 --> 00:41:50,120
She never said she was Catholic
and if she did, she said,

684
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:52,280
it's so quietly that I couldn't hear it.

685
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:56,450
So how the fuck could this random fucking
woman in the crowd here what she said,

686
00:41:58,530 --> 00:42:02,240
Oh fucking thing. It's going to make me
mad again. All right, let's continue.

687
00:42:02,390 --> 00:42:06,020
After he finally got off that
subject, his show just got worse.

688
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:07,970
This is when she's on
about her six strength.

689
00:42:08,210 --> 00:42:12,470
It appeared to my friends and I that he
may have been getting heat from some of

690
00:42:12,471 --> 00:42:15,080
the audience and that
he felt uncomfortable.

691
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:19,460
This may very well be the reason
why he continued to pick on the lady

692
00:42:21,130 --> 00:42:24,320
[inaudible] this is why I'm
picking on her, not because she,

693
00:42:24,350 --> 00:42:26,090
I as I'm doing my act, by the way,

694
00:42:26,091 --> 00:42:29,450
I keep looking down and she's getting
some sort of Martini thing that looks like

695
00:42:29,451 --> 00:42:31,730
there's a beer in it. I don't
know what the fuck it was.

696
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:34,700
It's one of those chick
fucking drinks, you know?

697
00:42:34,730 --> 00:42:38,030
Like what if we take root beer and
second fucking roofie in it, you know,

698
00:42:38,031 --> 00:42:41,420
she was drinking those
things. Okay. And uh,

699
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:44,870
so now she goes in this
very Mel, uh, he goes,

700
00:42:45,170 --> 00:42:49,580
this may very well be the reason why he
continued to pick on that lady even at

701
00:42:49,581 --> 00:42:52,280
one point telling her to
shut the fuck up. Yeah.

702
00:42:52,281 --> 00:42:56,180
I told you to shut the fuck up because
you were talking the entire time.

703
00:42:56,330 --> 00:43:00,290
You twat anyways. Ah, this
is downright unprofessional.

704
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:04,070
Who said that someone can not say a
few words to people at their table.

705
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:09,530
Did you see how obvious this is that
this is this the actual fucking woman who

706
00:43:09,531 --> 00:43:12,230
would give a fuck this much that
you would write three pages.

707
00:43:12,710 --> 00:43:16,760
They were quietly speaking and not
making any noise whatsoever. Oh,

708
00:43:16,761 --> 00:43:21,290
yet you heard her say that she was
Catholic on the other side of the stage.

709
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:25,850
There was another table talking quite a
bit more and they were louder due to the

710
00:43:25,851 --> 00:43:28,940
drinks yet he did not pick on
them. Do you want a fucking,

711
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:33,290
all right, let me just fucking relax
here. This is even funny anymore.

712
00:43:33,291 --> 00:43:35,780
Like I totally lost. I've, I've
lost the whole humor in this.

713
00:43:35,781 --> 00:43:38,840
This is fucking making me so mad. They
were more disruptive than anything,

714
00:43:38,990 --> 00:43:41,270
although he of course made
jokes about it. All right.

715
00:43:41,271 --> 00:43:43,910
There was this table next to
me. They were also drinking,

716
00:43:44,030 --> 00:43:47,330
but they were more doing that church thing
where I would say something funny and

717
00:43:47,331 --> 00:43:50,540
then they was sorta like fucking repeating
it. So they were a little bit rowdy,

718
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:51,740
but they were acceptable.

719
00:43:51,770 --> 00:43:55,520
This woman who was fucking out drinking
everyone at the other table had

720
00:43:55,521 --> 00:43:59,690
basically essentially her fucking back
to me to the point that if I fucking

721
00:43:59,691 --> 00:44:01,070
punched her in the back of the head,

722
00:44:01,190 --> 00:44:03,260
I would have got two
minutes for boarding pat.

723
00:44:03,261 --> 00:44:06,830
Possibly a fucking game misconduct.
Alright, there's something for you.

724
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:10,460
We'll Olympic hockey fucking people.
Anyways, let's, let's continue here.

725
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:11,750
Actually, that would be
roughing, wouldn't it?

726
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:15,080
Let's say I took the mic stand
and I turned it sideways.

727
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:18,590
I could have cross checked around the
fucking neck. All right, here we go.

728
00:44:18,830 --> 00:44:22,580
Now we are convinced that his wrong
demeanor was due to his discomfort.

729
00:44:22,581 --> 00:44:26,540
After realizing that he had offended
some of the audience in order to justify

730
00:44:26,541 --> 00:44:29,270
himself and ease any tension
coming from the audience member.

731
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:32,280
He said something along the
lines, don't listen to me.

732
00:44:32,281 --> 00:44:35,550
I'm just an idiot up here
speaking. Pray for me please.

733
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:40,110
That was obviously a demonstration
of his uneasiness. That's this is,

734
00:44:40,111 --> 00:44:43,050
this is how drunk she was.
What I was doing was I was,

735
00:44:43,410 --> 00:44:47,760
I was telling people in the crowd that
if they were religious that I respected

736
00:44:47,790 --> 00:44:50,040
their religion. All right?

737
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:51,560
Okay.

738
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:54,980
I just ha, I just personally
don't buy into it. Okay.

739
00:44:55,340 --> 00:44:59,390
So I'm only stopping right now to
say this because I know some of you,

740
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:02,650
you get so religious, you get
so into it that you can add,

741
00:45:02,740 --> 00:45:07,500
you get so holy that you can
actually commit murder. You know,

742
00:45:07,530 --> 00:45:11,130
God's usually as a tool
or you know, vengeance.

743
00:45:11,310 --> 00:45:14,160
I think that was the line
I used. I said, okay,

744
00:45:14,250 --> 00:45:15,630
you shouldn't be getting mad at me.

745
00:45:15,750 --> 00:45:18,060
You should pray for me
to help me see the light.

746
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:21,900
And everyone got a huge fucking
laugh at it about it. Okay.

747
00:45:21,901 --> 00:45:26,520
And this lady is basically us.
I can't wait to email her back.

748
00:45:26,521 --> 00:45:27,420
I don't know. I, I've,

749
00:45:27,421 --> 00:45:30,270
I've flip flopped a hundred times
in my head what I was gonna say.

750
00:45:31,310 --> 00:45:31,800
Okay.

751
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:33,680
You know, I just can't wait to, uh,

752
00:45:34,530 --> 00:45:38,180
I think I'm just gonna
write back something really
quickly. Okay. Like, Ruth,

753
00:45:38,181 --> 00:45:42,530
you actually pretending to not be the
dumb drunk bitch in the crowd is one of

754
00:45:42,531 --> 00:45:44,570
the funniest things I've ever
read. Something to that effect.

755
00:45:44,571 --> 00:45:47,450
Basically let her know that I know that
it's her and I'll see you next year.

756
00:45:47,451 --> 00:45:51,560
At the Improv, you're con. Um, anyways,
I am very supplies prize at your club.

757
00:45:51,590 --> 00:45:53,180
This is where she tries to, um,

758
00:45:53,900 --> 00:45:54,470
yeah.

759
00:45:54,470 --> 00:45:56,090
This is where she tries to
get me banned from the club.

760
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:58,910
I'm very surprised that a,
your club hosted this comedian.

761
00:45:59,180 --> 00:46:00,470
It was a true disappointment.

762
00:46:00,471 --> 00:46:04,550
I am embarrassed as I was the one who
suggested the Improv when my friends and I

763
00:46:04,551 --> 00:46:06,260
were planning to on seeing a comedy show.

764
00:46:06,470 --> 00:46:10,310
I do hope that you will consider not
having this comedian back as he gives your

765
00:46:10,311 --> 00:46:14,720
club a bad name. If this is a, this
had been my first time to the Improv,

766
00:46:14,810 --> 00:46:18,380
I never would've returned. You might
consider hiring some local talent.

767
00:46:18,381 --> 00:46:20,180
There are several good
comedians in the area.

768
00:46:20,330 --> 00:46:22,460
We are good friends with one
of them. If you like his name,

769
00:46:22,461 --> 00:46:25,280
I'll be happy to give it to
DPP a bit. Bit. All right.

770
00:46:25,340 --> 00:46:26,870
As for the lady who we picked on,

771
00:46:27,020 --> 00:46:30,260
she and her table were
unjustifiably asked to leave.

772
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:33,980
There was no grounds on having them
escorted from the show right in the middle

773
00:46:33,981 --> 00:46:35,540
of it. That's how drunk she was.

774
00:46:36,470 --> 00:46:40,130
She got escorted out 50 minutes
into my one hour set and she's like,

775
00:46:40,131 --> 00:46:41,900
she was escorted out in the middle of it.

776
00:46:42,340 --> 00:46:43,940
Do you understand how
drunk this woman was?

777
00:46:44,210 --> 00:46:47,750
I talked for Geez about
Jesus for 30 minutes. No,
actually it was seven minutes.

778
00:46:48,350 --> 00:46:49,880
I was escorted out in the middle. No,

779
00:46:49,881 --> 00:46:53,180
you were actually escorted out 50
minutes into the show when you were on.

780
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:55,190
You're fucking six drunk.
You're drunk. Can't,

781
00:46:55,940 --> 00:46:58,880
there were no grounds of on
having them escorted from uh,

782
00:46:58,910 --> 00:47:00,920
from the show right in
the middle of it. Again,

783
00:47:00,921 --> 00:47:03,770
they were not being disruptive
or at all this, this,

784
00:47:03,771 --> 00:47:07,310
this impartial person just wants to keep
talking about how innocent this fucking

785
00:47:07,311 --> 00:47:10,790
lady is that she never met. If it hadn't
been for bill burr picking on them,

786
00:47:10,910 --> 00:47:14,210
no one would've even noticed him. Okay.
The kids you tell, this is just the,

787
00:47:14,211 --> 00:47:17,780
the fucking drunk argument they had in
the crowd and in the car on the ride

788
00:47:17,781 --> 00:47:19,400
home, the loud table.

789
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:23,180
And the other side though is the one
that took away attention from his show.

790
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:26,360
I do understand that it is private
property and then anyone could be asked to

791
00:47:26,361 --> 00:47:29,740
leave at any time, but this was
wrong to do. This is a time to do it.

792
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:33,490
I personally believe that she should
receive an apology from the Improv,

793
00:47:33,610 --> 00:47:37,330
but mostly from bill burr. That's
clearly not my call. Just the thought.

794
00:47:37,331 --> 00:47:41,230
What a fucking, ah, I don't know.

795
00:47:41,260 --> 00:47:43,840
Did I take too long reading that
fucking thing. There you go.

796
00:47:43,841 --> 00:47:46,660
You want to be a standup comedian? That's
what the fuck you have to deal with.

797
00:47:47,710 --> 00:47:50,020
She's actually like a total
fucking control freak.

798
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:55,080
And what happened that night was
she completely lost on all levels.

799
00:47:56,890 --> 00:47:57,641
You know it's weird.

800
00:47:57,641 --> 00:48:01,030
You become like a part time psychologist
as you're breaking down the crowd as a

801
00:48:01,031 --> 00:48:04,840
comedian and she sat at the
power position at the table.

802
00:48:05,110 --> 00:48:06,640
The table is at like a fucking,

803
00:48:06,670 --> 00:48:09,550
we'll say like a 30 degree
angle coming in stage left.

804
00:48:09,551 --> 00:48:12,580
This is going to get technical.
All right, you fucks. Don't don't,

805
00:48:12,581 --> 00:48:14,500
don't leave me here. She, you know,

806
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:18,970
she didn't sit at like the the chair
furthest away. If you sit furthest away,

807
00:48:19,450 --> 00:48:22,600
everybody you're at the table with
has the back of their head to you.

808
00:48:22,601 --> 00:48:25,660
So then when you want to fucking
talk, it's, it's a difficult time.

809
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:28,960
What she did was not only did
she sit in the first chair,

810
00:48:29,050 --> 00:48:32,500
she sat on the first chair
closest to me, so the,

811
00:48:32,510 --> 00:48:35,770
so all she had to do is turn around. She
had the whole fucking tables attention.

812
00:48:36,130 --> 00:48:38,440
And when she stood up,
when she went to leave,

813
00:48:38,530 --> 00:48:41,980
her whole table stood up like a
bunch of fucking minions. You know,

814
00:48:42,070 --> 00:48:45,010
like you remember that dude, he used to
carry the fucking umbrella for puffy.

815
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:47,230
That's how they all got
up. It was pathetic.

816
00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:51,700
And people like that surround themselves
with fucking weak people like that

817
00:48:51,790 --> 00:48:54,910
because any normal people, person,
you know, think about that.

818
00:48:54,940 --> 00:48:56,260
All you guys listen to
right now, if you're,

819
00:48:56,261 --> 00:48:59,110
if your buddy was being a drunk fucking
asshole and got booted from the club,

820
00:48:59,230 --> 00:49:02,470
would you get up and leave immediately?

821
00:49:02,590 --> 00:49:07,120
Stand up like the fucking general just
got up. I mean, I guess maybe you would.

822
00:49:07,121 --> 00:49:08,230
Could you be, well, Kay's drunk.

823
00:49:08,231 --> 00:49:11,200
Maybe he's going to go fucking walk
out in a p on a cop or something.

824
00:49:11,201 --> 00:49:15,520
I guess maybe. I Dunno. Anyways,
you know, before I emailed her back,

825
00:49:15,521 --> 00:49:17,890
what do you guys think I should write
back and come up with something clever

826
00:49:17,891 --> 00:49:20,430
other than calling her a con like
I did. I think I'm just going,

827
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:23,320
I'm going to write back something to the
effect that I realized that it was her

828
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:28,150
and um, I don't know. I don't fucking
know. Was that just a big waste of time?

829
00:49:28,151 --> 00:49:32,050
Should I not have been bothered
with all of that? You know,

830
00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:37,120
I don't know then and I had another
incident with another fucking person.

831
00:49:37,150 --> 00:49:42,100
I Dunno. I, I have issues with,
with a beautiful women. I really do.

832
00:49:42,310 --> 00:49:44,740
This is actually a bit I want to
do on stage and I'll just, I'll,

833
00:49:44,741 --> 00:49:48,550
maybe I'll do part of it for you
here at bay. The basic idea, I just,

834
00:49:48,610 --> 00:49:51,640
I don't respect them on a certain level.

835
00:49:52,780 --> 00:49:55,240
I feel like I had to do something

836
00:49:56,860 --> 00:50:01,270
to achieve in life. All they had to do
was basically they were born beautiful.

837
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:03,820
This, it's really not an accomplishment.
I guess you go to the gym,

838
00:50:03,821 --> 00:50:07,450
you stay beautiful past a certain
age. It is an accomplishment I guess,

839
00:50:07,451 --> 00:50:11,020
but you know, I dunno for, in order to,

840
00:50:11,021 --> 00:50:12,640
as a guy to get around beautiful women,

841
00:50:12,641 --> 00:50:16,780
you have to accomplish all this shit in
life and all they have to do to get to

842
00:50:16,781 --> 00:50:17,830
where the fuck you're at.

843
00:50:17,831 --> 00:50:22,450
After accomplishing all this shit is
basically take a shower and feather their

844
00:50:22,451 --> 00:50:26,410
hair back like Farrah Fawcett and
they're in the fucking VIP. You know?

845
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:31,460
I also don't like them because a, I don't
know. I don't know if they're smart.

846
00:50:31,580 --> 00:50:33,380
They, if they're smart, they're
absolutely stunning though.

847
00:50:33,381 --> 00:50:35,240
I have to admit that. But you know,

848
00:50:36,870 --> 00:50:37,150
okay.

849
00:50:37,150 --> 00:50:40,030
If they're, if they're dumb, that's
like, it's like you got a Lamborghini,

850
00:50:40,031 --> 00:50:44,710
but you find out it has a four cylinder
in it. Or even worse, my fucking hybrid.

851
00:50:45,190 --> 00:50:49,030
Did that make any fucking sense? You
know, they have that one default emotion.

852
00:50:49,060 --> 00:50:53,860
Oh my God. And they give 58
different reads. You know,

853
00:50:53,861 --> 00:50:56,550
if they see something cute like a
little puppy, they're like, oh my God.

854
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:01,930
You know, if you do something
sweet from, Oh my God,

855
00:51:03,650 --> 00:51:04,110
okay,

856
00:51:04,110 --> 00:51:07,560
you know, you do something that
they fucking hate. Oh my God,

857
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:11,420
fucking idiots. They got three
words floating around right

858
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:13,040
there. And then with VIP, you know,

859
00:51:51,530 --> 00:51:52,363
[inaudible]

860
00:51:54,270 --> 00:51:56,310
and somebody said, uh,
was actually saying like,

861
00:51:56,311 --> 00:51:59,220
I was trying to figure out
why I was finding these
fucking women's so attractive

862
00:51:59,221 --> 00:52:01,980
other than the obvious that
they were good looking women.

863
00:52:02,010 --> 00:52:03,900
This guy actually said, hey, bill, uh,

864
00:52:04,330 --> 00:52:07,290
beside the obvious hot women
vigorously scrubbing the floor,

865
00:52:09,150 --> 00:52:10,770
I really set that up bad. He's saying,

866
00:52:10,771 --> 00:52:15,450
this is why men find women curlers
attractive. I just blew that joke.

867
00:52:15,451 --> 00:52:16,200
He said,

868
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:20,460
besides the obvious hot women
vigorously scrubbing the floor,

869
00:52:21,060 --> 00:52:21,900
I have to, yeah,

870
00:52:21,910 --> 00:52:24,720
you so deserved a huge laugh on that
and I just fucked you out of it.

871
00:52:24,750 --> 00:52:27,720
I'm sorry about that.
Um, anyways, he says,

872
00:52:27,721 --> 00:52:30,390
I have figured out why we
love watching this so much.

873
00:52:30,391 --> 00:52:32,130
When they release that stone,

874
00:52:32,460 --> 00:52:37,460
the way they let it slide out of their
hand is reminiscent of the way a skillful

875
00:52:37,681 --> 00:52:42,630
woman releases your cock after
delivering a massive hand job.

876
00:52:43,770 --> 00:52:44,521
First of all,

877
00:52:44,521 --> 00:52:49,521
I hope you're a surfer cause that's the
only reason why to the massive hand job,

878
00:52:50,881 --> 00:52:55,470
Bruh. I'm fucking massive hands job.

879
00:52:55,830 --> 00:52:59,100
Or maybe you just have a fucking bit or
maybe I'll just, you have a fat cock.

880
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:03,750
I Dunno. So anyways, she goes, uh,
they don't drop it. Don't push it.

881
00:53:03,751 --> 00:53:08,751
Just let it slide out naturally as I go
to sleep with my boxes around my ankles.

882
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:12,480
Oh, I forgot. That was
creepy. I know. I read it.

883
00:53:12,481 --> 00:53:15,300
I was supposed to just read the beginning
joke cause I thought the joke was

884
00:53:15,301 --> 00:53:20,160
fucking great. I forgot the
fucking picture in his, Ugh guys,

885
00:53:20,161 --> 00:53:22,770
with those fucking insect
looking legs on guy's legs,

886
00:53:22,820 --> 00:53:27,820
like insects with that fucking hair all
over skinny fucking legs were a mess.

887
00:53:29,490 --> 00:53:33,930
Fucking mess. I'm like
praying mantis legs. Anyways,

888
00:53:34,290 --> 00:53:36,870
I'm a long time ago. I talked about
unacceptable. This is when, you know,

889
00:53:36,871 --> 00:53:40,320
the podcast sucks and I'm just plowing
from fucking topic to topic and there's

890
00:53:40,321 --> 00:53:45,210
just no sort of a no segway
other than dead silence.

891
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:46,633
Um,

892
00:54:17,260 --> 00:54:18,093
[inaudible]

893
00:54:19,030 --> 00:54:22,200
did somebody do a Bob Dole impression?
[inaudible] just the worst.

894
00:54:22,770 --> 00:54:27,630
Can I tap out at this fucking point
37 minutes in a bad wedding stories.

895
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:31,290
I'm, hey bill, I haven't listened
to your podcast since the beginning.

896
00:54:31,291 --> 00:54:34,470
Decided it was about time I emailed
you and told you how much I enjoy it.

897
00:54:34,471 --> 00:54:38,670
Thank you very much.
Uh, [inaudible]. Okay,

898
00:54:38,671 --> 00:54:42,870
let's get to the, uh, let's
get to the marriage thing.

899
00:54:43,830 --> 00:54:48,540
Um, okay. I got a marriage
story when I was 23.

900
00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:51,210
I was dating a girl and she got pregnant.

901
00:54:54,150 --> 00:54:58,080
Ah Dude. Okay. Uh, so we decided
to get married. Okay. Stupid.

902
00:54:58,081 --> 00:54:59,640
Fucking move number two,

903
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:04,080
even though a month before this I
was thinking about dumping her ass.

904
00:55:04,290 --> 00:55:08,740
Stupid mistake number three. Actually
that was the smart move. That was,

905
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:11,700
that was the three card Monte
right there. Don't knock her up.

906
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:16,830
Don't fucking marry you're white.
Knock her up. Marry her dumper ass.

907
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:21,150
You know which one had the
marble? You fucked up. All right,

908
00:55:21,210 --> 00:55:24,840
so all the plans are made, our families
meet each other. Okay. Just cause I,

909
00:55:24,841 --> 00:55:26,980
you know, had to do that stupid
three card, Monte joking,

910
00:55:27,010 --> 00:55:30,720
a desperate attempt to try to be
remotely funny. At this point. You don't,

911
00:55:30,721 --> 00:55:33,060
it was, I have a blue wind screen
this week. I'm going to blow that.

912
00:55:33,090 --> 00:55:34,680
I'm going to, I'm going
to blame it on that one.

913
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:37,050
You know my fucking
dog ate the orange one,

914
00:55:37,051 --> 00:55:41,360
so I'm going to blame it on the blue
wind screen. Anyway. So basically,

915
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:44,100
sky's 23 years old. He
knocks up this fucking girl.

916
00:55:44,101 --> 00:55:46,200
He decides to get married
even though he did.

917
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:49,860
He thought about dumping our month before.
So anyway, so all the plans are made.

918
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:55,860
Um, families meet each other, invitations
are sent out, all that bullshit.

919
00:55:55,861 --> 00:55:57,480
So three days before the wedding,

920
00:55:57,810 --> 00:56:02,340
I'm watching some stupid movie where
this guy tells his other guy that his dad

921
00:56:02,341 --> 00:56:06,120
told him before his wedding. It's
never too late to change your mind,

922
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:11,670
to which his friend says, but you're
not married. And I guess it is.

923
00:56:11,671 --> 00:56:13,440
That's a laugh. So anyways, uh,

924
00:56:13,441 --> 00:56:18,030
so taking this as a sign from God that
I just happened to be watching this

925
00:56:18,031 --> 00:56:20,760
movie. I canceled a wedding. Great.

926
00:56:21,450 --> 00:56:24,640
Fucking move. All right.

927
00:56:24,940 --> 00:56:28,690
Which is suffice to say, brought
a shitstorm into my life.

928
00:56:28,930 --> 00:56:33,550
The worst part is that I actually
felt so bad. I marry that check.

929
00:56:33,551 --> 00:56:36,220
Three months later I'll,
dude, you were out.

930
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:41,800
You were fucking out. So
basically I was a pussy.

931
00:56:42,460 --> 00:56:44,260
Yeah, yeah, but too, that's a hard thing.

932
00:56:44,261 --> 00:56:47,500
You were dealing with a lot of shit
at 23 your parents were crying.

933
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:51,640
She was knocked up. Yeah. I
wouldn't say you were pussy.

934
00:56:51,641 --> 00:56:53,970
You gave into peer pressure anyways,

935
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:59,110
we were married for seven years with
every year being worse than the year

936
00:56:59,110 --> 00:57:02,020
before. So we're divorced.
So we're divorced now.

937
00:57:02,050 --> 00:57:05,290
So I guess I should have gone
with my gut to wrap this up,

938
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:07,990
I got a little gripe with, with chicks.

939
00:57:08,260 --> 00:57:12,610
My ex used to ask me when the marriage
was going down, if I could go back,

940
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:16,270
would I not meet her? Which
I would say, fuck yeah,

941
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:21,280
I would avoid you like the
plague. Which she would say, uh,

942
00:57:22,150 --> 00:57:25,000
but w at which point she would say,
but you wouldn't have our two kids,

943
00:57:25,001 --> 00:57:29,680
don't you love them? And then he
would say, yeah, but then I'd say,

944
00:57:29,681 --> 00:57:32,860
but I would never have met you. So
I would have never had the kids.

945
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:35,590
So in that scenario, the
kids aren't even a thought.

946
00:57:35,830 --> 00:57:40,270
This of course would lead to a
huge fight about my lack of caring,

947
00:57:41,050 --> 00:57:45,730
a moral to the story. Don't use
logic when talking to chicks. Aright.

948
00:57:46,930 --> 00:57:49,790
That's actually not the moral
to the story. What it is,

949
00:57:49,791 --> 00:57:54,550
is you got to think how women think, you
know, which you know, if you're lucky,

950
00:57:54,610 --> 00:57:56,830
at some point when you're 90, you'll know,

951
00:57:57,230 --> 00:58:01,720
you'll understand 10% of what the
fuck is going on in that brain. Um,

952
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:05,890
basically when she's asking
you that, she was asking that,

953
00:58:06,790 --> 00:58:11,170
I would guess one of two reasons.
One, she was insecure that, you know,

954
00:58:11,980 --> 00:58:14,970
you knocked her up and then you married
her and you know that you were gonna

955
00:58:14,980 --> 00:58:18,880
marry her. Then you broke it off and
then you fucking married her. Uh,

956
00:58:18,940 --> 00:58:22,000
believe it or not, I'm sure that's not
how she dreamed of getting married.

957
00:58:22,001 --> 00:58:25,990
She probably dreamed of
meeting her soulmate and they
were so hopelessly in love

958
00:58:25,991 --> 00:58:29,740
that everyone in the crowd had tears in
their eyes for, they never found a love.

959
00:58:29,741 --> 00:58:31,180
Soap is great as there.

960
00:58:32,380 --> 00:58:37,380
She could have been thinking that and
she wanted you to reassure her or she

961
00:58:38,051 --> 00:58:42,160
probably was just banging you, you know,

962
00:58:42,220 --> 00:58:44,950
it didn't want to fucking marry you
and didn't think that you were the one

963
00:58:44,951 --> 00:58:45,280
either.

964
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:50,280
And all of a sudden she got knocked up
and she's probably sitting there looking

965
00:58:51,431 --> 00:58:54,190
at the Sadie your fucking head. One
mornings you're eating pancakes,

966
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:58,750
trying to find where in
the world she loves you.

967
00:58:59,470 --> 00:59:02,800
You know, on what fucking level, you know,

968
00:59:02,801 --> 00:59:05,380
just watching your temples going
in and out as you're chewing,

969
00:59:05,950 --> 00:59:10,240
just fighting that fucking urge to
slam a toaster over your fucking head.

970
00:59:11,170 --> 00:59:14,620
You know, just wondering how the hell
did I end up with this fucking guy?

971
00:59:14,830 --> 00:59:16,660
Why did I say Yes to this guy?

972
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:20,890
Why did I let him fucking drop a
fucking load in me? What is wrong with,

973
00:59:22,010 --> 00:59:26,600
and just trying to make the fact that
you had these two kids justice justice

974
00:59:26,601 --> 00:59:30,770
enough. You know, that's what the
fuck was probably going on. But uh,

975
00:59:31,220 --> 00:59:31,731
I dunno dude,

976
00:59:31,731 --> 00:59:35,900
you didn't really talk about how much
of a nightmare the wedding was that that

977
00:59:35,901 --> 00:59:39,440
was the meat of the story there. I
think you at the beginning and the end,

978
00:59:39,441 --> 00:59:41,630
but what are you thinking is
she's coming down the aisle.

979
00:59:43,250 --> 00:59:44,540
What is your family thinking?

980
00:59:45,050 --> 00:59:47,890
You're knocked her up and then you
dumped her and yet now you're like,

981
00:59:48,060 --> 00:59:49,550
oh fuck it all marry or anyways,

982
00:59:49,551 --> 00:59:52,130
and you're only 23 they know
you don't want to do it.

983
00:59:53,320 --> 00:59:55,510
Those weren't tears of
joy, my friend, you know,

984
00:59:55,511 --> 00:59:58,480
what are you thinking is
you're up there, you know,

985
01:00:02,230 --> 01:00:06,340
was your Cumberbun like wringing wet
with flop sweat as you was standing up?

986
01:00:06,341 --> 01:00:07,360
I can't imagine that.

987
01:00:09,710 --> 01:00:10,543
Ah,

988
01:00:11,310 --> 01:00:15,900
has anybody ever just ran out the side
door? Cause I can definitely see like,

989
01:00:15,901 --> 01:00:18,090
oh my God, I don't know what to
say. How do I get out of this shit?

990
01:00:18,091 --> 01:00:20,700
And then just in a
panic when they started,

991
01:00:21,190 --> 01:00:25,790
Eh, Eh, Eh, Eh, Eh, Eh, Eh,

992
01:00:26,450 --> 01:00:28,280
Eh, Eh,

993
01:00:29,250 --> 01:00:32,440
you turned around looking,
where is she a what?

994
01:00:32,441 --> 01:00:34,810
A fucked and I have some wedding music
underneath this would've would've been

995
01:00:34,811 --> 01:00:38,410
hilarious stuff. I bet if I
fucking prepared, you know,

996
01:00:38,590 --> 01:00:40,300
you're looking for the
bitch, where the fuck is you?

997
01:00:40,301 --> 01:00:43,690
And then she comes around the corner
and you're trying to make yourself lover

998
01:00:44,020 --> 01:00:48,460
and she comes around the corner and you
just see that fucking face and you see

999
01:00:48,461 --> 01:00:52,660
those eyebrows and you know we're going
to be touching by the time she's 40 and

1000
01:00:52,661 --> 01:00:57,661
you just fucking run out the side door
in those cheap tuxedo bowling shoes.

1001
01:00:58,480 --> 01:00:59,313
Okay.

1002
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:04,230
And you know what I mean? And you're
in such a fucking panic, you know,

1003
01:01:04,380 --> 01:01:09,380
there's no way that you're going to be
able to get your car keys out in time,

1004
01:01:09,430 --> 01:01:13,630
get them into the door, open the
door, lock the door, and get in there.

1005
01:01:13,631 --> 01:01:17,530
And it's like people are gonna be coming
out running out of the church like some

1006
01:01:17,531 --> 01:01:21,070
fucking Zombie movie is. You're
trying to get your car started.

1007
01:01:21,071 --> 01:01:25,270
I made the move there is you.
If you're, anybody does that,

1008
01:01:25,271 --> 01:01:29,010
don't go to your car.
You keep running. Okay?

1009
01:01:29,130 --> 01:01:33,480
Most people get married in the suburbs,
so headed head for a wooded area.

1010
01:01:34,080 --> 01:01:38,250
All right? Go Online. Learn how to turn
your fucking Cumberbun into a tent.

1011
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:43,110
Hang out there for a couple of days.
Let Shit cool off. Grow a beard.

1012
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:47,670
Come back to town, get some provisions
that point you'll be so fucking filthy.

1013
01:01:48,030 --> 01:01:50,790
You just another homeless guy
wearing a suit. You know what I mean?

1014
01:01:52,660 --> 01:01:55,000
Just let her forget all about you and
then maybe they'll think that you're

1015
01:01:55,001 --> 01:01:57,700
mentally ill and then, uh, you know,

1016
01:01:57,701 --> 01:02:01,630
one day you just show up on your mother's
front steps and she faints her dad

1017
01:02:01,631 --> 01:02:05,530
catches you and punches you in the face
cause he's a former marine. You know,

1018
01:02:05,560 --> 01:02:09,520
haven't we all seen this movie? I'm
trying to say, run out the fucking door.

1019
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:14,970
Run out the fucking door if you're in
that situation, during that situation.

1020
01:02:15,610 --> 01:02:19,130
All right. Uh, Bill, longtime
listener, first time writer, uh,

1021
01:02:19,250 --> 01:02:22,950
got a wedding story to tell you. I'm
23 years old now. The 23 year old.

1022
01:02:23,360 --> 01:02:27,330
I've been to a, here's one for you. Don't
go to a wedding or get married at 23.

1023
01:02:27,360 --> 01:02:29,500
They all seem to have bad stories. Um,

1024
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:33,360
I've been to a few weddings and let
me start by saying in this story,

1025
01:02:33,361 --> 01:02:37,110
it wasn't actually a wedding
I witnessed. It was a wicking,

1026
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:41,700
a Wiccan hand fastening. Okay. Now though,

1027
01:02:41,701 --> 01:02:44,810
for those of you not familiar
with the Wiccan religion, uh,

1028
01:02:44,820 --> 01:02:48,780
I just want to state at this
point, neither am I. Um,

1029
01:02:49,980 --> 01:02:54,900
I can't remember if that's the one
that actually has all those uh,

1030
01:02:54,930 --> 01:02:57,570
pagan symbols that, you know,

1031
01:02:57,571 --> 01:03:02,571
the Catholic Church then said that
they were devil signs according to the,

1032
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:05,340
uh, fucking Rosetta Stone or
whatever that fucking movie was.

1033
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:09,120
I read the book too. What the fuck
is the name of that Davinci Code?

1034
01:03:09,980 --> 01:03:12,030
Whatever it was called,
a Wiccan hand fastening.

1035
01:03:12,060 --> 01:03:15,750
And I know that because my sister
didn't invite people to our wedding,

1036
01:03:15,990 --> 01:03:18,330
she invited them to her hand. Fascinating.

1037
01:03:18,750 --> 01:03:23,580
That's why he knew it was a Wiccan hand
fastening and not a wedding because she

1038
01:03:23,581 --> 01:03:28,110
said, I'd like to invite you to my
hand. Fascinating. Jesus Christ.

1039
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:33,060
Um, he said, if you're 41, you still
don't know what a hand fastening is.

1040
01:03:33,060 --> 01:03:36,090
Congratulations. Thank you. Because
I didn't, so anyways, he goes,

1041
01:03:36,091 --> 01:03:38,910
I'm 17 at the time, my sister's 23 or 24,

1042
01:03:39,090 --> 01:03:42,390
we both still live with our parents
are boyfriend and unemployed,

1043
01:03:42,391 --> 01:03:47,070
alcoholic living off money. His
mom left him when she died. Ah,

1044
01:03:47,130 --> 01:03:49,470
there you go ladies. There you go.

1045
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:53,910
You don't have to settle for less
when this guys like him out there. Um,

1046
01:03:53,911 --> 01:03:57,960
anyways, um, the fuck am I,

1047
01:03:58,350 --> 01:04:01,830
why didn't I make this tight, bigger?
Jesus. What a flop this podcast is.

1048
01:04:02,430 --> 01:04:05,520
So anyways, so this fucking alcoholic
was over for dinner one night.

1049
01:04:05,550 --> 01:04:09,690
He tapped his fork on a glass of few
times to get everyone's attention.

1050
01:04:10,080 --> 01:04:14,880
We were three feet from him
and immediately my stomach
knotted up because I knew

1051
01:04:14,881 --> 01:04:18,920
this moron was about to say something
stupid. You got gotta I got to meet you.

1052
01:04:18,921 --> 01:04:22,770
You guys are fucking funny writers,
man. Some really talented people.

1053
01:04:22,771 --> 01:04:26,010
Listen to this fucking podcast. You
guys write better than I do. Anyways,

1054
01:04:26,011 --> 01:04:30,600
basically he announced his engagement
to my sister in front of my mom and dad

1055
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:35,460
pulled out two onyx rings and they put
them on each other's middle fingers.

1056
01:04:35,610 --> 01:04:38,250
You know, I went to the Onyx Strip
club and now Houston last night.

1057
01:04:38,251 --> 01:04:42,480
How funny is that? Anyways,
it was dead silent. And um,

1058
01:04:42,660 --> 01:04:47,160
the look of a repressed horror on
my mom's face was unmistakable.

1059
01:04:47,670 --> 01:04:49,050
It was so awkward.

1060
01:04:49,260 --> 01:04:53,550
So I just started clapping
going Yay, quietly,

1061
01:04:53,551 --> 01:04:55,410
because nobody else joined in.

1062
01:04:58,740 --> 01:05:00,930
Oh, that's great. Is that
your role in the family?

1063
01:05:00,931 --> 01:05:05,250
You're the person who always tries to
make it better. Uh, God bless Ya. Anyways,

1064
01:05:05,310 --> 01:05:09,120
it was just dead silence and my sister
and her boyfriend kissing each other like

1065
01:05:09,121 --> 01:05:10,290
everything was fine.

1066
01:05:11,100 --> 01:05:15,720
A few months later I found out they were
financing those rings and going into

1067
01:05:15,721 --> 01:05:17,070
payments on them. Every,

1068
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:22,090
my sister's collecting child support and
neither of them have a job and they are

1069
01:05:22,270 --> 01:05:25,270
financing onyx hand fastening rings.

1070
01:05:26,470 --> 01:05:30,460
Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ.

1071
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:33,040
I can't believe there's more to
this story. All right, here we go.

1072
01:05:34,180 --> 01:05:37,260
Fucking knee deep. I got to go the
rest of the way. All right. Anyway,

1073
01:05:37,261 --> 01:05:38,094
so I finally,

1074
01:05:38,570 --> 01:05:43,510
finally gets to their hand fastening day
and they're doing the ceremony right on

1075
01:05:43,511 --> 01:05:47,080
Newport beach. It's in the
middle of the day on a,

1076
01:05:47,081 --> 01:05:51,820
on Sunday in the summer,
they didn't have, oh,

1077
01:05:51,821 --> 01:05:55,990
they didn't reserve a piece of beach or
anything. They just showed up and go,

1078
01:05:55,991 --> 01:05:59,200
hey, let's have the wedding here. Um,

1079
01:05:59,230 --> 01:06:03,850
the family we had, oh fuck. I gotta
sit closer to the damn screen.

1080
01:06:03,851 --> 01:06:07,720
I can't read anymore. The family we have
near the beach mostly all showed up.

1081
01:06:07,721 --> 01:06:09,850
All the people who live near
the beach mostly showed all.

1082
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:13,390
There were about 30 or
40 of us. None of us,

1083
01:06:13,480 --> 01:06:17,200
none of us are dressed in beach clothes.
Half of them are in suits and dresses.

1084
01:06:17,410 --> 01:06:19,840
There are no chairs.
There's not even an altar.

1085
01:06:19,841 --> 01:06:23,920
Everybody's just standing around hot and
they can't sit down because there's no

1086
01:06:23,921 --> 01:06:26,320
chairs and they don't. They
don't want to ruin their clothes.

1087
01:06:26,770 --> 01:06:29,770
My sister shows up in an
all black gown with a veil.

1088
01:06:29,980 --> 01:06:34,360
The boyfriend is wearing like a Tux
with his face painted like one of the

1089
01:06:34,361 --> 01:06:39,220
misfits, kind of like a
skeleton face. Jesus Christ.

1090
01:06:40,150 --> 01:06:43,120
It sounds like the episode
of the office. Anyways,

1091
01:06:43,121 --> 01:06:45,160
they don't do any
traditional wedding stuff.

1092
01:06:45,160 --> 01:06:49,300
They just go right up front of the crowd
with their Wiccan priest or whatever.

1093
01:06:49,301 --> 01:06:52,120
The wicked priest is basically
just a friend of theirs.

1094
01:06:52,420 --> 01:06:56,800
He reads a bunch of a bunch of stuff
from a book in some other language.

1095
01:06:56,980 --> 01:06:59,770
My sister and the boyfriend are
responding in some other language.

1096
01:06:59,890 --> 01:07:01,660
Nobody has any idea what's going on.

1097
01:07:01,690 --> 01:07:06,690
Then all of a sudden the boyfriend pulls
out this crazy looking knife with a

1098
01:07:07,331 --> 01:07:12,130
what? A hilt. I don't know what that
is. Uses it to cut my sister's Vale,

1099
01:07:12,700 --> 01:07:16,360
then pokes the end of it into
his finger until he's bleeding.

1100
01:07:16,630 --> 01:07:21,160
He sticks the knife into the sand and
wraps his bloody hand around my sister's

1101
01:07:21,161 --> 01:07:24,760
neck while they kiss the stone.

1102
01:07:25,090 --> 01:07:28,870
Hippy priest holds up his book and
said something loud in that different

1103
01:07:28,871 --> 01:07:29,704
language.

1104
01:07:30,220 --> 01:07:34,750
I assume it was he equivalent equivalent
of I now pronounce you husband and

1105
01:07:34,751 --> 01:07:37,060
wife. I'm sure being comedian.

1106
01:07:37,061 --> 01:07:40,510
You've heard the sound of 50
people gasping simultaneously.

1107
01:07:40,810 --> 01:07:44,740
Family members in suits and dresses
are just walking away. At this point.

1108
01:07:45,190 --> 01:07:49,720
A lifeguard saw with the boyfriend did
with the knife called the cop and the day

1109
01:07:49,721 --> 01:07:53,800
ended prematurely with him getting cuffed
and driven away in a police cruiser.

1110
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:58,270
Jesus Christ. Anyways, thanks for the
podcast. I really enjoy Jesus Christ.

1111
01:07:58,271 --> 01:08:01,570
How about a fucking round of
applause for that story? All right.

1112
01:08:01,870 --> 01:08:05,830
I think I have to read up on
the Wiccan religion. You know,

1113
01:08:05,831 --> 01:08:07,090
one thing I did like about that,

1114
01:08:07,091 --> 01:08:10,660
I did like the fact that they just showed
up and just decided to have a wedding

1115
01:08:10,900 --> 01:08:14,290
and they avoided all
those other costs. Um,

1116
01:08:14,980 --> 01:08:16,190
cause I wanted to say halfway

1117
01:08:16,190 --> 01:08:17,750
through that like, you
know, they didn't have,

1118
01:08:17,780 --> 01:08:21,530
they didn't reserve that piece of the
beach or anything and I was thinking like,

1119
01:08:21,531 --> 01:08:25,040
well, you never had to back in
the day. You know what I mean?

1120
01:08:26,060 --> 01:08:27,650
You just fucking had a wedding. There was,

1121
01:08:27,651 --> 01:08:30,770
it wasn't like nine zillion fucking
dollars. It didn't matter where you were,

1122
01:08:30,771 --> 01:08:33,640
but I guess you have to do that now. Uh,

1123
01:08:33,710 --> 01:08:38,570
because there's nine zillion people and
uh, and bankers run the fucking world.

1124
01:08:38,810 --> 01:08:41,570
Hey, speaking of that, did you get,
somebody sent me an email the other day,

1125
01:08:41,571 --> 01:08:43,640
evidently Europe elected a president.

1126
01:08:44,870 --> 01:08:49,400
You hear that Europe elected a
president, not England, not France,

1127
01:08:49,430 --> 01:08:50,060
Europe,

1128
01:08:50,060 --> 01:08:55,060
the entire continent now has a fucking
president has one guy in charge of all of

1129
01:08:55,641 --> 01:08:56,474
them.

1130
01:08:57,140 --> 01:09:01,130
See that just like those three d
TVs that are only a few months away,

1131
01:09:01,131 --> 01:09:05,200
that new world daughter is going to be
available right down at the best common

1132
01:09:05,680 --> 01:09:10,040
sowed come and fucking soon. If you go
on to read about the, uh, the bailout,

1133
01:09:10,430 --> 01:09:13,370
uh, rolling stone has a
great article and, uh,

1134
01:09:13,371 --> 01:09:17,870
usually I try to stay away from their
politics because there's so brutally to

1135
01:09:17,871 --> 01:09:22,070
the left. It's fucking
ridiculous. Um, you know,

1136
01:09:22,160 --> 01:09:26,630
they never trashed Democrats or when
they do, it's so like light hand.

1137
01:09:26,660 --> 01:09:29,870
They just doing it just because
they trashed a republican so bad.

1138
01:09:29,960 --> 01:09:33,260
They're trying to show that they're fair
and balanced like those other fucking

1139
01:09:33,261 --> 01:09:38,240
maniacs. Um, Fox News actually has a
store now when you go through the airport,

1140
01:09:38,270 --> 01:09:42,500
which I think is hilarious, they sell
water and that type of shit. So I dunno.

1141
01:09:42,690 --> 01:09:44,900
It's going to be, what is gonna
be one fucking news channel.

1142
01:09:44,970 --> 01:09:47,930
This is going to be one president and
one fucking currency of money and you

1143
01:09:47,931 --> 01:09:49,010
better do what they say.

1144
01:09:49,680 --> 01:09:51,360
That's going to be the
end of it. My friends

1145
01:10:28,130 --> 01:10:28,963
[inaudible] [inaudible]

1146
01:11:04,570 --> 01:11:05,403
[inaudible]

1147
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:13,920
[inaudible].
