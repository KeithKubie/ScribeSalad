00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.279
Here's our second challenge problem for U-substitution. Now again, there won't

00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:07.594
be a solution video for this problem, but there are two different ways that you

00:00:07.594 --> 00:00:11.974
can solve it. You can either use U-substitution by making some sort of

00:00:11.974 --> 00:00:16.827
substitution for these negative exponents and this variable. Or if you remember

00:00:16.827 --> 00:00:20.589
what a negative exponent means, you can rewrite this entire equation and solve

00:00:20.589 --> 00:00:25.584
it using something you've already done before. I hope you take on this

00:00:25.584 --> 00:00:26.290
challenge.
