00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Obviously you can do this by using our table over here.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Remember to use the two the tail not the one tail and by multiplying in the appropriate magic number.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:17.000
The mean is easy. It's 0.4 and this thing over here, we'll find the appropriate element in the table.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:24.000
For any puts five, we're going to look at the row four and for 90% we look at the 0.92 tails,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:31.000
this one over here and they intersect at 2.132 and if we multiply this to 0.219,

00:00:31.000 --> 99:59:59.000
we get 0.467 approximately--would have been the correct answer.
