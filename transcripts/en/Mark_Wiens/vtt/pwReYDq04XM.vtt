00:00:00.765 --> 00:00:02.182
- Bangkok famous!

00:00:03.241 --> 00:00:06.658
Oh, look at that, that is just beautiful!

00:00:08.068 --> 00:00:11.651
(funky instrumental music)

00:00:14.127 --> 00:00:16.763
Hey everyone, it's Mark
Wiens with migrationology.com

00:00:16.763 --> 00:00:18.660
in Bangkok, Thailand.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.341
I'm in a taxi right now and
on my way to Dalat See Yan

00:00:23.341 --> 00:00:25.158
which is near Tou Dusit

00:00:25.158 --> 00:00:28.060
and I am going to eat at what I've heard

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.366
is one of the most legendary
places to eat a dish

00:00:30.366 --> 00:00:32.765
called yum naem khao tod,

00:00:32.765 --> 00:00:35.203
which is a fermented pork rice salad.

00:00:35.203 --> 00:00:37.493
It's only gonna be a take-away food stall

00:00:37.493 --> 00:00:40.239
so they have no seating and no tables

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:42.695
and they just serve it
to you in a plastic bag.

00:00:42.695 --> 00:00:44.538
If you want to eat it on-spot,

00:00:44.538 --> 00:00:47.254
you gotta bring your own plate,

00:00:47.254 --> 00:00:49.171
so somewhere in my bag,

00:00:51.228 --> 00:00:54.447
I've got a plate and I
am gonna eat it on-spot.

00:00:54.447 --> 00:00:56.078
I got a plate and
there's a spoon somewhere

00:00:56.078 --> 00:00:58.745
below the camera in my backpack.

00:00:59.624 --> 00:01:03.291
(upbeat instrumental music)

00:01:11.075 --> 00:01:13.825
(motors revving)

00:01:18.497 --> 00:01:21.057
I really love Sriyan Market.

00:01:21.057 --> 00:01:23.349
There are so many interesting things

00:01:23.349 --> 00:01:26.835
and it's such an old
classic Bangkok market

00:01:26.835 --> 00:01:28.824
and this has been one
of my favorite markets

00:01:28.824 --> 00:01:30.489
in Bangkok for a long time.

00:01:30.489 --> 00:01:33.418
There is a lot of
delicious food around here,

00:01:33.418 --> 00:01:36.065
but the reason that I
have never tried this

00:01:36.065 --> 00:01:39.001
yam naem place is because
they are literally

00:01:39.001 --> 00:01:43.621
only open for a couple of
random hours during the day,

00:01:43.621 --> 00:01:46.232
and a couple of random
hours in the evening

00:01:46.232 --> 00:01:49.022
so if you don't catch them
at the exact right time,

00:01:49.022 --> 00:01:50.485
you will never see them.

00:01:50.485 --> 00:01:53.692
And also from what I've
read they often sometimes

00:01:53.692 --> 00:01:55.302
sell out before they even open,

00:01:55.302 --> 00:01:56.489
there's a whole long line of people

00:01:56.489 --> 00:01:57.992
and they only have a certain amount

00:01:57.992 --> 00:02:01.251
that they sell per day,
or per time they open.

00:02:01.251 --> 00:02:02.762
Ying, my wife, talked
to them on the phone.

00:02:02.762 --> 00:02:04.943
They said they're gonna be open at 2 p.m.

00:02:04.943 --> 00:02:06.883
So we have about an hour
to just walk around,

00:02:06.883 --> 00:02:08.380
but we're definitely gonna show up early

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.271
so that we get our hands
on some yam naem today.

00:02:12.271 --> 00:02:14.227
As we're waiting for the yam naem,

00:02:14.227 --> 00:02:15.534
we've decided to try,

00:02:15.534 --> 00:02:17.114
there's another famous
vendor that's selling

00:02:17.114 --> 00:02:18.197
haw mok here.

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.928
So it is haw mok made with snakehead fish.

00:02:37.928 --> 00:02:40.595
I know it's down here somewhere.

00:02:42.002 --> 00:02:43.335
Oh, where is it?

00:02:44.182 --> 00:02:46.116
I hope I didn't forget my spoon.

00:02:46.116 --> 00:02:48.619
Oh, I got it, oh yeah.

00:02:48.619 --> 00:02:50.761
So I just got one haw mok

00:02:50.761 --> 00:02:52.491
and she told me that
it's made with pla chon,

00:02:52.491 --> 00:02:54.219
which is snakehead fish

00:02:54.219 --> 00:02:58.038
and haw mok is a type of fish custard

00:02:58.038 --> 00:03:00.671
which is made with a
whole bunch of curry paste

00:03:00.671 --> 00:03:04.171
and fish and then it's stirred for so long

00:03:05.775 --> 00:03:08.099
that it turns to almost a meringue.

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:11.939
This is a real old Thai dish
that has Portuguese influence,

00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:13.743
so it's kind of a Portuguese-Thai dish

00:03:13.743 --> 00:03:16.291
It's steamed in a little
banana leaf cup and then,

00:03:16.291 --> 00:03:20.057
oh yeah, you can feel that
like custardy texture.

00:03:20.057 --> 00:03:20.890
Oh yes.

00:03:21.764 --> 00:03:25.931
And I really love haw mok
when it is made the old way

00:03:26.955 --> 00:03:29.612
but you can definitely find
some versions of haw mok

00:03:29.612 --> 00:03:31.336
which are not very good.

00:03:31.336 --> 00:03:34.308
(chuckles) And this is
definitely gonna be a good one!

00:03:34.308 --> 00:03:37.109
At least I think so,
because you can already see

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:39.397
the pieces of fish in there

00:03:39.397 --> 00:03:42.897
and then the custardy curry paste and egg,

00:03:44.792 --> 00:03:48.959
which is just like coating
and surrounding it in custard.

00:03:54.674 --> 00:03:55.954
Oh wow!

00:03:55.954 --> 00:03:58.015
That's one of the best
haw moks I've ever had.

00:03:58.015 --> 00:03:58.848
Mmm!

00:04:00.119 --> 00:04:02.536
The depth of spices in there,

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:07.426
and then the fish is really
soft and really juicy

00:04:07.426 --> 00:04:10.489
and then it's just surrounded
by that coconut milk

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:13.927
which has like completely custard-ified.

00:04:13.927 --> 00:04:14.760
I'm gonna take another bite

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:15.802
with that piece of fish and that chili,

00:04:15.802 --> 00:04:18.475
and you can just see all that juice

00:04:18.475 --> 00:04:21.571
and those juices that
have formed down there.

00:04:21.571 --> 00:04:24.684
That coconut milk, the
eggs in there, the fish,

00:04:24.684 --> 00:04:26.851
it is just a pure harmony.

00:04:29.566 --> 00:04:31.614
And normally, you would
eat this with rice,

00:04:31.614 --> 00:04:34.742
but just as a steak it is amazing.

00:04:34.742 --> 00:04:39.246
The leaves on the bottom, in
Thai, they're called bai yaw.

00:04:39.246 --> 00:04:40.510
And they're kind of stuck below there.

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:42.177
There they all came.

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:52.707
This is why I love Sriyan Market so much.

00:04:54.222 --> 00:04:57.409
There are so many gems like this.

00:04:57.409 --> 00:04:59.350
Haw mok is one of the Thai dishes

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:04.014
that's very common to find,
but it's very hard to find

00:05:04.014 --> 00:05:05.961
a really good version.

00:05:05.961 --> 00:05:09.600
That's because it's actually
very difficult to make

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.496
and it's also very time consuming,

00:05:11.496 --> 00:05:15.108
because you have to really
stir the coconut cream

00:05:15.108 --> 00:05:16.758
until it becomes custard

00:05:16.758 --> 00:05:19.425
and it's very strenuous as well.

00:05:20.285 --> 00:05:25.144
But this is a true place to
eat some amazing haw mok.

00:05:25.144 --> 00:05:26.693
Wow, that was good!

00:05:26.693 --> 00:05:28.254
We have about a 30 minute wait now

00:05:28.254 --> 00:05:30.957
until they open the next stall.

00:05:30.957 --> 00:05:35.124
(woman speaks in foreign language)

00:05:38.513 --> 00:05:42.680
(mans speaks in foreign language)

00:05:47.045 --> 00:05:51.212
(woman speaks in foreign language)

00:06:44.807 --> 00:06:46.259
Oh, you got one to-go too?

00:06:46.259 --> 00:06:48.076
- These are to-go.

00:06:48.076 --> 00:06:50.693
- She literally just rolled the cart

00:06:50.693 --> 00:06:53.069
to the position here on the sidewalk

00:06:53.069 --> 00:06:56.039
and magically just a whole
crowd of people appeared

00:06:56.039 --> 00:06:57.762
and started ordering.

00:06:57.762 --> 00:06:59.261
But yeah, she definitely had some orders

00:06:59.261 --> 00:07:01.207
before she even started selling

00:07:01.207 --> 00:07:05.535
and she is just busy as soon
as she rolls her cart here.

00:07:05.535 --> 00:07:06.786
Instead of having her put it

00:07:06.786 --> 00:07:08.164
into the plastic bag for takeaway,

00:07:08.164 --> 00:07:10.513
I just gave her my plate
which I brought with me.

00:07:10.513 --> 00:07:13.328
This salad is composed
of three different parts,

00:07:13.328 --> 00:07:17.495
the pig skin and the khao
tod, which is like rice balls.

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:21.605
She has already broken them down

00:07:21.605 --> 00:07:23.426
but they are deep-fried rice balls,

00:07:23.426 --> 00:07:25.258
and then also the crunchy bits.

00:07:25.258 --> 00:07:26.836
Then she mixed in some chili flakes,

00:07:26.836 --> 00:07:29.240
she mixed in some lime
juice and fish sauce,

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:32.186
and she really stirred it
up just extremely expertly

00:07:32.186 --> 00:07:34.405
using a plastic-bag mitten

00:07:34.405 --> 00:07:35.978
and then piled it onto this plate.

00:07:35.978 --> 00:07:37.361
Oh, and there's some green onions on top.

00:07:37.361 --> 00:07:39.736
Then in the bag here, she
gave me some side toppings.

00:07:39.736 --> 00:07:40.928
She said to put this on first,

00:07:40.928 --> 00:07:44.218
which is some kind of fried, crispy batter

00:07:44.218 --> 00:07:46.108
with some chilies and peanuts on it.

00:07:46.108 --> 00:07:48.275
Should I dump this all on?

00:07:49.571 --> 00:07:52.441
I think I will just dump this all on.

00:07:52.441 --> 00:07:54.632
Some extra crispies with peanuts

00:07:54.632 --> 00:07:57.145
and some fried chilies on there too.

00:07:57.145 --> 00:07:59.041
Then there's also vegetables on the side,

00:07:59.041 --> 00:08:01.800
some raw vegetables to
eat with it as well.

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:03.633
But I just gotta taste this immediately.

00:08:03.633 --> 00:08:04.913
I thought I had lost my spoon,

00:08:04.913 --> 00:08:07.362
but then I remembered
I put it in my pocket.

00:08:07.362 --> 00:08:09.521
You've always gotta carry a spoon with you

00:08:09.521 --> 00:08:10.488
in your pocket.

00:08:10.488 --> 00:08:12.317
I'm going in!

00:08:12.317 --> 00:08:13.567
Bangkok famous.

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:17.185
Oh look at that, that is just beautiful.

00:08:17.185 --> 00:08:21.451
The individual little
pieces in this mixture

00:08:21.451 --> 00:08:23.398
are just fantastic.

00:08:23.398 --> 00:08:25.363
I think I have a little bit
of everything in this bite

00:08:25.363 --> 00:08:28.311
and I got one of those dried
fried chilies and a peanut,

00:08:28.311 --> 00:08:32.478
some crispies, some of the
rice, and a lot of pig skin.

00:08:38.392 --> 00:08:42.529
I have to admit, that pig
skin usually does not sound

00:08:42.529 --> 00:08:44.207
all that appealing to me.

00:08:44.207 --> 00:08:46.832
But this is unbelievable.

00:08:46.832 --> 00:08:48.604
You cannot really tell it's pig skin.

00:08:48.604 --> 00:08:51.306
It's so soft and so tender

00:08:51.306 --> 00:08:55.101
and it has just like a very slightly,

00:08:55.101 --> 00:08:57.661
slightly gelatinous texture to it,

00:08:57.661 --> 00:08:59.880
but actually, the way she's cooked it,

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:01.518
it's so soft and tender.

00:09:01.518 --> 00:09:05.102
And then, oh man, there's some
little pieces of minced pork

00:09:05.102 --> 00:09:07.162
in there as well, but then also

00:09:07.162 --> 00:09:10.250
the little soft pieces of pork skin

00:09:10.250 --> 00:09:14.586
are just broken up by the
really crispy little bits.

00:09:14.586 --> 00:09:16.649
And it's spicy, a lot of
ground chili in there,

00:09:16.649 --> 00:09:17.788
powdered chili.

00:09:17.788 --> 00:09:19.677
And then also it's nice and
sour from the lime juice

00:09:19.677 --> 00:09:22.867
and just perfectly salted
from the fish sauce.

00:09:22.867 --> 00:09:25.617
Wow, that is actually remarkable.

00:09:33.001 --> 00:09:34.334
That is so good!

00:09:37.102 --> 00:09:39.263
And what you can really taste are like

00:09:39.263 --> 00:09:43.000
every single individual
piece in this mixture.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.891
You can taste every single
piece of the pig skin.

00:09:45.891 --> 00:09:50.058
You can taste the little
kernels of fried fritter.

00:09:50.982 --> 00:09:53.710
You can taste the green onions,
you can taste the chilies.

00:09:53.710 --> 00:09:55.645
And you also get a little bit of sourness

00:09:55.645 --> 00:09:58.228
from that fermentation as well.

00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:10.514
It almost kinda eats like a trail mix.

00:10:10.514 --> 00:10:12.795
You can almost just pick
it up with your fingers

00:10:12.795 --> 00:10:16.221
and just kinda eat it like
a bag of chips or something.

00:10:16.221 --> 00:10:18.200
I'm going in for some raw vegetables.

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:21.715
There are some pennywort
leaves and some cabbage.

00:10:21.715 --> 00:10:24.113
Actually, let me put some
of this onto my plate.

00:10:24.113 --> 00:10:28.153
I'll just put a handful
of it onto my plate.

00:10:28.153 --> 00:10:31.569
Oh yeah, and you can just sort of garnish.

00:10:31.569 --> 00:10:33.661
Oh, there's some Vietnamese
coriander here too.

00:10:33.661 --> 00:10:35.567
In Thai it's called phak phaew

00:10:35.567 --> 00:10:38.823
and then some pennywort leaves.

00:10:38.823 --> 00:10:41.240
You can just kind of garnish.

00:10:44.512 --> 00:10:47.012
Mmm, very, very green tasting.

00:10:48.532 --> 00:10:49.365
I love it.

00:10:54.155 --> 00:10:58.322
Yeah, it sort of has like
the caramelized crunchy bit

00:11:01.778 --> 00:11:04.505
that you get at the
bottom of the rice cooker,

00:11:04.505 --> 00:11:06.272
but that's actually deep fried.

00:11:06.272 --> 00:11:08.855
(group laughs)

00:11:13.070 --> 00:11:14.820
Very good, very good.

00:11:41.761 --> 00:11:45.928
(woman speaks in foreign language)

00:11:47.266 --> 00:11:49.804
Yeah, as we're standing here
eating this plate of yam naem,

00:11:49.804 --> 00:11:52.380
a friendly guy, he was just talking to us

00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:55.048
and basically he was just joking

00:11:55.048 --> 00:11:57.434
and he was saying the yam naem is not good

00:11:57.434 --> 00:11:58.802
and she's not very nice.

00:11:58.802 --> 00:12:00.588
You should not come here to eat

00:12:00.588 --> 00:12:04.818
as he was buying like four
bagsful of takeaway. (chuckles)

00:12:04.818 --> 00:12:06.569
This is one of those dishes
that you keep on eating

00:12:06.569 --> 00:12:08.043
and you don't even realize it,

00:12:08.043 --> 00:12:09.916
and all of a sudden
you're on your last bite.

00:12:09.916 --> 00:12:11.856
And so, I'm on my last bite.

00:12:11.856 --> 00:12:14.289
Or at least, couple of last bites.

00:12:14.289 --> 00:12:16.872
But it has gone down so easily.

00:12:20.604 --> 00:12:21.437
Wow!

00:12:25.090 --> 00:12:26.533
Although it contains pig skin,

00:12:26.533 --> 00:12:30.700
it's such a like, light
dish, and kinda refreshing.

00:12:34.282 --> 00:12:36.504
That was well worth the
food adventure it was

00:12:36.504 --> 00:12:39.049
to come eat this yam naem khao tod.

00:12:39.049 --> 00:12:41.466
That was really, really good.

00:12:42.837 --> 00:12:46.860
Each of the components
actually are kind of random

00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:48.611
and kind of plain on their own,

00:12:48.611 --> 00:12:50.543
but when they are mixed together

00:12:50.543 --> 00:12:52.145
and then seasoned with lime juice

00:12:52.145 --> 00:12:54.314
and fish sauce and chili flakes,

00:12:54.314 --> 00:12:58.481
it just creates like a very
unlikely snack mixture,

00:12:59.777 --> 00:13:02.782
and it even has like a dryness to it.

00:13:02.782 --> 00:13:06.216
It's not like a juicy mixture,
but it's just so good,

00:13:06.216 --> 00:13:08.528
and it works so well together,

00:13:08.528 --> 00:13:10.911
and that is by all means
the best one I've ever had

00:13:10.911 --> 00:13:13.244
in my life, across Thailand.

00:13:14.271 --> 00:13:15.601
That's really, really good.

00:13:15.601 --> 00:13:17.364
She's really nice.

00:13:17.364 --> 00:13:18.972
The hardest thing about coming here

00:13:18.972 --> 00:13:21.624
is trying to figure
out their opening times

00:13:21.624 --> 00:13:23.933
and if they have sold out or not.

00:13:23.933 --> 00:13:25.759
So that is a little tricky.

00:13:25.759 --> 00:13:27.823
I'm gonna try to write all the details.

00:13:27.823 --> 00:13:29.902
I'm gonna end the video here.

00:13:29.902 --> 00:13:31.774
Thank you all very much
for watching this video.

00:13:31.774 --> 00:13:34.472
Please remember to give it a
thumbs up if you enjoyed it.

00:13:34.472 --> 00:13:35.768
Also leave a comment below.

00:13:35.768 --> 00:13:37.429
I would love to hear from you

00:13:37.429 --> 00:13:39.951
and I will see you on the next video.

00:13:39.951 --> 00:13:43.701
