00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.862
There was a little confusion
with dideoxies in one sense,

00:00:03.862 --> 00:00:08.000
and some of these things like
the PCR you're going to have to

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.034
sort of sit down and actually
think about it,

00:00:11.034 --> 00:00:14.758
but the principle of the
dideoxies, if we were making a

00:00:14.758 --> 00:00:18.965
chain of beads that had a hook
on one end and a little hole on

00:00:18.965 --> 00:00:22.551
the other, and we were joining
these things together,

00:00:22.551 --> 00:00:25.655
we could make obviously,
a chain that went on.

00:00:25.655 --> 00:00:30.000
And then we could hook another
one in, and so on.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.636
And if we had a bunch of beads
like this every now and then we

00:00:34.636 --> 00:00:39.197
threw in a very small number
that didn't have the hook on the

00:00:39.197 --> 00:00:43.833
end, any time this particular
chain were elongating and we put

00:00:43.833 --> 00:00:47.710
on one of these things,
the chain would stop because

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:50.826
you haven't got any where to
join onto it.

00:00:50.826 --> 00:00:54.171
You added dideoxy into a
polymerase reaction.

00:00:54.171 --> 00:00:58.807
A chain that gets the dideoxy
doesn't have anything to join in

00:00:58.807 --> 00:01:02.000
the end, and that will stop.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.805
If we only added this,
the entire reaction would stop,

00:01:06.805 --> 00:01:11.701
and everyone would come at the
first time a dideoxy got

00:01:11.701 --> 00:01:12.879
incorporated.

00:01:12.879 --> 00:01:16.053
The trick is to put a little
bit in.

00:01:16.053 --> 00:01:18.864
So, a few of the molecules
stop.

00:01:18.864 --> 00:01:20.949
Everything keeps going.

00:01:20.949 --> 00:01:24.666
The next time a dideoxy gets
incorporated,

00:01:24.666 --> 00:01:27.024
the chain will stop there.

00:01:27.024 --> 00:01:31.104
And out of this,
you will generate a family of

00:01:31.104 --> 00:01:36.000
polymers that are of different
lengths.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.404
Each one will terminate with a
dideoxy nucleotide,

00:01:40.404 --> 00:01:45.348
and if the dideoxy nucleotide
we used in that particular

00:01:45.348 --> 00:01:48.584
reaction was,
let's say, dideoxy ATP,

00:01:48.584 --> 00:01:53.797
that means that an A was the
last nucleotide added to every

00:01:53.797 --> 00:01:54.966
one of those.

00:01:54.966 --> 00:02:00.000
And we can separate these on
the basis of size.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.095
And if I ran them out on a gel,
I'd see something like that.

00:02:04.095 --> 00:02:08.120
And that would tell me that
when that polymerase was coming

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:11.035
along, that was the first time
it saw an A.

00:02:11.035 --> 00:02:14.020
A few stopped there,
polymerized a few more.

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.491
Then it put in another A,
put in some other things,

00:02:17.491 --> 00:02:18.185
and so on.

00:02:18.185 --> 00:02:21.516
And that by itself wouldn't
tell us the sequence.

00:02:21.516 --> 00:02:24.709
But if I did that reaction four
times in a row,

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:27.000
then I could tell.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.994
In the old days,
they didn't used to use dyes.

00:02:29.994 --> 00:02:33.653
We just did P32 on it as a
label, and then you'd run the

00:02:33.653 --> 00:02:35.516
four reactions side-by-side.

00:02:35.516 --> 00:02:37.778
And this would be with dideoxy
ATP.

00:02:37.778 --> 00:02:41.571
You'd see a pattern like that,
and maybe with dideoxy TTP,

00:02:41.571 --> 00:02:43.567
you'd see something like this.

00:02:43.567 --> 00:02:47.160
And when you got the rest of
them, you'd kind of end up

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.086
working out what the sequence
was by looking across the four

00:02:51.086 --> 00:02:51.485
lanes.

00:02:51.485 --> 00:02:55.544
This business of using the dye
is just one more step up in the

00:02:55.544 --> 00:02:58.804
engineering side that enables
the thing to be done

00:02:58.804 --> 00:03:01.000
automatically.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.320
And it's pretty well explained
in your textbooks.

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:08.539
OK, PCR, someone was confused
as to why we didn't just let the

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:09.300
cell do it.

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:13.312
Well, the cell does a great
job, but if you are a molecular

00:03:13.312 --> 00:03:17.600
biologist trying to understand
the basis of life or if you're a

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:20.575
biological engineer,
and you want to produce

00:03:20.575 --> 00:03:24.725
something, you need to get hold
of a particular piece of DNA.

00:03:24.725 --> 00:03:27.284
Or, if you're a forensic
investigator,

00:03:27.284 --> 00:03:30.535
and you've got a tiny,
tiny sample of human DNA,

00:03:30.535 --> 00:03:36.000
and you want to know whose it
is, you have to make more of it.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.327
And, that's what PCR is all
about.

00:03:38.327 --> 00:03:42.277
So I'm going to switch just
over to the net for a minute.

00:03:42.277 --> 00:03:45.591
I think this first site,
I just want to show you

00:03:45.591 --> 00:03:49.400
something, how somebody
functions in a lab now with all

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:50.952
these genes out there.

00:03:50.952 --> 00:03:55.324
And then, I'm going to show you
a little animation for PCR that

00:03:55.324 --> 00:03:56.030
will help.

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:58.992
So, if you just go to Google
and type NCBI,

00:03:58.992 --> 00:04:04.000
that's the National Center for
Biotechnology Information.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:10.365
And, the Dolan Learning Center
is a center that Cold Spring

00:04:10.365 --> 00:04:16.292
Harbor Laboratory has set up to
teach people about DNA.

00:04:16.292 --> 00:04:18.926
So let me just see here.

00:04:18.926 --> 00:04:22.768
So, let's just go to,
OK, let's use,

00:04:22.768 --> 00:04:26.719
whoops, this is going to seize
on us.

00:04:26.719 --> 00:04:43.000
OK, let's find how it happens.
00:04:31&lt;clear/&gt;
 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.394
OK, so here's this National
Center for Biotechnology

00:04:46.394 --> 00:04:47.193
Information.

00:04:47.193 --> 00:04:50.255
There's all sorts of things you
can search for,

00:04:50.255 --> 00:04:53.051
and I'm not expecting you to
know the site.

00:04:53.051 --> 00:04:55.580
I just want to sort of give you
a demo.

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:59.641
If I was sitting in my office,
this is the sort of thing I can

00:04:59.641 --> 00:05:00.307
do easily.

00:05:00.307 --> 00:05:03.302
Rather than sequence looking
for DNA sequence,

00:05:03.302 --> 00:05:06.697
I'm going to look for the
translated sequence of the

00:05:06.697 --> 00:05:10.624
protein that's encoded by the
gene where the computer's gone

00:05:10.624 --> 00:05:14.552
through and used the genetic
codes tell me the sequence of a

00:05:14.552 --> 00:05:15.084
protein.

00:05:15.084 --> 00:05:19.145
I told you about sequencing a
mismatch repair gene back in the

00:05:19.145 --> 00:05:19.411
80s.

00:05:19.411 --> 00:05:22.406
It was called MutS,
and I'll put in Walker GC,

00:05:22.406 --> 00:05:27.000
and probably hopefully get us
to the thing.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.125
And there, the very first hit
is DNA repair.

00:05:30.125 --> 00:05:33.905
Protein MutS salmonella
typhimurium, that's the one I

00:05:33.905 --> 00:05:34.632
sequenced.

00:05:34.632 --> 00:05:36.376
So I'll just go to that.

00:05:36.376 --> 00:05:39.720
It has various ways of
displaying the sequence.

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:44.081
I'm going to switch to Fasta,
which is a very easy way to see

00:05:44.081 --> 00:05:44.299
it.

00:05:44.299 --> 00:05:48.224
Now what you see is the
sequence of the protein using a

00:05:48.224 --> 00:05:51.495
one letter code,
or one letter stands for each

00:05:51.495 --> 00:05:52.295
amino acid.

00:05:52.295 --> 00:05:53.167
K is lysine.

00:05:53.167 --> 00:05:54.839
A is alanine,
and so on.

00:05:54.839 --> 00:06:00.000
I'm just going to copy that,
that piece of sequence.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.730
OK so that's the bacterial gene
for mismatch repair.

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:05.942
At the time I put that in the
database, there wasn't anything

00:06:05.942 --> 00:06:08.137
else like it,
except for the gene that was

00:06:08.137 --> 00:06:09.422
Streptococcus pneumonia.

00:06:09.422 --> 00:06:11.831
But I found out,
someone else is sequencing by

00:06:11.831 --> 00:06:13.330
phoning around in the field.

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:16.489
I'm going to go back to the
main site and I'm going to use a

00:06:16.489 --> 00:06:18.952
program called Blast,
which lets you search the

00:06:18.952 --> 00:06:19.808
entire database.

00:06:19.808 --> 00:06:21.147
I'll use a protein blast.

00:06:21.147 --> 00:06:24.198
I'm going to take a protein
sequence, and I'm going to ask

00:06:24.198 --> 00:06:28.000
what else is out there in terms
of protein sequences?

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:35.801
I'll paste in this bacterial
sequence, and then I'm going to,

00:06:35.801 --> 00:06:39.442
if I can, manage this thing.

00:06:39.442 --> 00:06:44.513
Let's see if I can get myself
down here.

00:06:44.513 --> 00:06:52.315
OK, over here I'll probably do,
OK, so I'm going to limit it,

00:06:52.315 --> 00:06:56.736
let's just search the human
genome.

00:06:56.736 --> 00:07:00.247
That's all we've got to do.

00:07:00.247 --> 00:07:06.749
And what did I have to do to
get this thing to fit?

00:07:06.749 --> 00:07:10.000
Which button?

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.877
Go to the right.

00:07:11.877 --> 00:07:19.033
Can you just come up here for a
second to help me get this set

00:07:19.033 --> 00:07:19.385
up?

00:07:19.385 --> 00:07:23.608
I'm computer limited here
apparently.

00:07:23.608 --> 00:07:28.770
OK, that one,
OK, great, so why do we not try

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:31.000
this again?

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:49.541
PAUSE]
Sorry about this.

00:07:49.541 --> 00:07:57.875
We'll see if we can get this
thing to go.

00:07:57.875 --> 00:08:01.000
I have what?

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:07.876
Yeah, that's OK though.

00:08:07.876 --> 00:08:13.855
That should be fine.

00:08:13.855 --> 00:08:16.845
Try again.

00:08:16.845 --> 00:08:30.000
Let's see if I can get the
thing to work.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.806
OK, so it's got it now.

00:08:31.806 --> 00:08:32.906
It'll tell me.

00:08:32.906 --> 00:08:36.677
It's searching all the sequence
that's out there.

00:08:36.677 --> 00:08:40.369
There's just an unbelievable
amount of sequence.

00:08:40.369 --> 00:08:42.647
That's just how long it took.

00:08:42.647 --> 00:08:46.732
It's showing me here a
diagrammatic representation of

00:08:46.732 --> 00:08:47.596
the things.

00:08:47.596 --> 00:08:52.231
Then I can see that the very
first it was MutS homolog three

00:08:52.231 --> 00:08:53.095
for humans.

00:08:53.095 --> 00:08:56.552
And if I go down here,
we can actually see on

00:08:56.552 --> 00:09:00.244
alignment of the bacterial gene
on the top line,

00:09:00.244 --> 00:09:04.407
and the lines below is the
sequence of that particular

00:09:04.407 --> 00:09:07.000
human homolog.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.380
And you can see in between all
the things that are in common,

00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:13.422
and particularly down at the
C-terminus of the protein,

00:09:13.422 --> 00:09:15.901
you can see there's very strong
conservation.

00:09:15.901 --> 00:09:19.112
You may not think that that's
impressive, but remember for

00:09:19.112 --> 00:09:22.154
every one of those positions,
there's 20 possibilities.

00:09:22.154 --> 00:09:25.197
So, if you get that many in a
row, that's the same gene

00:09:25.197 --> 00:09:25.760
basically.

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:28.746
And when you take the
structure, the structure's going

00:09:28.746 --> 00:09:31.000
to be very, very similar.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.876
And it does mismatch repair in
both.

00:09:34.876 --> 00:09:41.411
Just to try and give you an
idea of how you do sequence now,

00:09:41.411 --> 00:09:48.056
because with all these genomes
done, you do the vast majority

00:09:48.056 --> 00:09:53.041
of it by computer,
rather than some other way.

00:09:53.041 --> 00:09:57.028
I want to take you and show you
this.

00:09:57.028 --> 00:10:00.240
DNA learning:
if you go there,

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:06.000
the second thing is a set of
animations.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.818
Go to the animations.

00:10:07.818 --> 00:10:11.282
There's one on polymerase chain
reaction.

00:10:11.282 --> 00:10:16.304
And, I'm going to just show you
this because this is a nice

00:10:16.304 --> 00:10:20.807
little, let's see if we can get
this thing to center.

00:10:20.807 --> 00:10:25.136
OK we'll have to see whether
this is going to work.

00:10:25.136 --> 00:10:30.159
OK, so this is the principle
of, you can go do this at your

00:10:30.159 --> 00:10:35.354
leisure, but the idea is to heat
the DNA up, the strands come

00:10:35.354 --> 00:10:37.000
apart.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.973
Then, were going to take these
two little primers,

00:10:39.973 --> 00:10:42.340
not promoters,
which I think someone was

00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:44.828
confused about,
a little piece of DNA that

00:10:44.828 --> 00:10:46.649
complimentary,
and anneal them.

00:10:46.649 --> 00:10:48.408
Than we added DNA polymerase.

00:10:48.408 --> 00:10:50.047
You know what happens then.

00:10:50.047 --> 00:10:51.503
We extend those primers.

00:10:51.503 --> 00:10:53.021
That was the first cycle.

00:10:53.021 --> 00:10:54.477
Do the same thing again.

00:10:54.477 --> 00:10:55.873
Go to the second cycle.

00:10:55.873 --> 00:11:00.000
This is what I was drawing on
the board the other day.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.991
Now are going to denature the
DNA.

00:11:03.991 --> 00:11:06.774
The strands come apart.

00:11:06.774 --> 00:11:11.129
Let's let the polymerase extend
them.

00:11:11.129 --> 00:11:16.572
Let's go to the third cycle,
denature the DNA,

00:11:16.572 --> 00:11:21.169
anneal the primers,
extend the primers,

00:11:21.169 --> 00:11:28.185
and now for the first time,
we've got what we were shooting

00:11:28.185 --> 00:11:30.000
for.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:42.483
We have a double-stranded copy
of just the DNA that was defined

00:11:42.483 --> 00:11:46.912
between those primers.

00:11:46.912 --> 00:11:57.181
OK, I think this actually,
I'm going to go back one.

00:11:57.181 --> 00:12:00.000
Oops, OK.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.633
If you go, then,
to the amplification graph,

00:12:03.633 --> 00:12:08.535
what they're doing here is
they're showing you what happens

00:12:08.535 --> 00:12:10.901
as you do successive cycles.

00:12:10.901 --> 00:12:13.943
So, at the first,
oh, it's down here.

00:12:13.943 --> 00:12:15.126
Just a minute.

00:12:15.126 --> 00:12:19.774
If we do the first cycle,
we end up with two DNA copies.

00:12:19.774 --> 00:12:22.985
That's just plotting what I
showed you.

00:12:22.985 --> 00:12:25.183
The next one:
we have four.

00:12:25.183 --> 00:12:30.000
We haven't yet got to this
target sequence.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.857
By the next cycle,
we now have two copies of the

00:12:34.857 --> 00:12:38.888
target sequence plus these other
things.

00:12:38.888 --> 00:12:44.262
But if you keep going,
let's say by the time we're at

00:12:44.262 --> 00:12:48.706
seven cycles,
the number of targets is up to

00:12:48.706 --> 00:12:49.120
114.

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:52.324
The number of DNA copies is
128.

00:12:52.324 --> 00:12:58.008
But, if we keep going like
this, we'll find out that the

00:12:58.008 --> 00:13:04.106
target copies become the vast
majority of the sequences that

00:13:04.106 --> 00:13:07.000
are in there.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.104
So, by the time that you're up
in the 30 cycles,

00:13:11.104 --> 00:13:15.646
or something like that,
there's only a handful of the

00:13:15.646 --> 00:13:18.266
original things,
or almost all,

00:13:18.266 --> 00:13:23.157
and that, I hope will help some
of you who might have had

00:13:23.157 --> 00:13:27.000
problems with understanding the
PCR.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.538
So, what I'm going to do is
tell you a few more things about

00:13:31.538 --> 00:13:35.923
what you can do with recombinant
DNA, this recombinant DNA

00:13:35.923 --> 00:13:39.076
technology, because it's just so
powerful.

00:13:39.076 --> 00:13:43.846
And I can only sort of give you
a few ideas, and show you a few

00:13:43.846 --> 00:13:44.692
variations.

00:13:44.692 --> 00:13:49.000
But, most of these things are
just taking principles that

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.692
you've already learned as part
of the basic biology I'm trying

00:13:53.692 --> 00:13:58.615
to tell you, and then using them
like an engineer to achieve some

00:13:58.615 --> 00:14:01.000
applied purpose.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.806
For example suppose I wanted to
produce a human protein,

00:14:04.806 --> 00:14:07.367
and try and produce it in a
bacterium.

00:14:07.367 --> 00:14:08.751
That would be great.

00:14:08.751 --> 00:14:10.551
I could take the one gene.

00:14:10.551 --> 00:14:12.904
I could grow a fermenter load
of E.

00:14:12.904 --> 00:14:16.918
coli, and if I got it right,
then I'd be able to make a lot

00:14:16.918 --> 00:14:20.794
of this protein instead of
trying to isolate it from some

00:14:20.794 --> 00:14:23.217
human source or something like
that.

00:14:23.217 --> 00:14:25.224
There's a couple of problems.

00:14:25.224 --> 00:14:26.677
We talked about them.

00:14:26.677 --> 00:14:30.000
One is the problem of
promoters.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.537
Another one is that human DNA
would have introns in it.

00:14:34.537 --> 00:14:38.823
And, bacteria doesn't recognize
the human promoters.

00:14:38.823 --> 00:14:43.109
It wouldn't start to make an
RNA in the right place,

00:14:43.109 --> 00:14:48.151
and it doesn't know what to do
about splicing out the intron.

00:14:48.151 --> 00:14:51.008
So, let's address the intron
first.

00:14:51.008 --> 00:14:55.126
There is a way of handling that
that's quite easy.

00:14:55.126 --> 00:15:00.000
And that's what's called to
make cDNA library.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:06.848
So, if we have DNA,
and then we get the RNA,

00:15:06.848 --> 00:15:12.899
we get the RNA copy [SOUND
OFF/THEN ON]

00:15:12.899 --> 00:15:17.996
including these intron
sequences.

00:15:17.996 --> 00:15:25.959
And then what happens,
this is RNA splicing that we

00:15:25.959 --> 00:15:28.029
talked about.

00:15:28.029 --> 00:15:35.037
And what we get out of that
would be an mRNA,

00:15:35.037 --> 00:15:43.000
in which the introns have been
removed.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.820
So, eukaryotic cells,
my cells, know how to express

00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:51.558
the gene, so they make the RNA,
they know how to get rid of the

00:15:51.558 --> 00:15:52.169
introns.

00:15:52.169 --> 00:15:55.225
So, if I were to isolate a
messenger RNA.

00:15:55.225 --> 00:15:58.893
That's been spliced from me,
or you, or anything,

00:15:58.893 --> 00:16:03.096
what we would have is a
population of RNA molecules that

00:16:03.096 --> 00:16:06.000
don't have introns anymore.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:14.787
Anybody remember any way we
could get from RNA back to DNA?

00:16:14.787 --> 00:16:18.121
Reverse transcriptase.

00:16:18.121 --> 00:16:23.575
So, if we used reverse
transcriptase,

00:16:23.575 --> 00:16:30.696
that protein that David
Baltimore discovered and

00:16:30.696 --> 00:16:40.090
viruses, and which retroviruses
use, now we would have a signle

00:16:40.090 --> 00:16:46.000
stranded DNA copy of the mRNA.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.734
And then, we could use an
ordinary DNA polymerase to get

00:16:49.734 --> 00:16:51.907
ourselves to double-stranded
DNA.

00:16:51.907 --> 00:16:54.962
We'd be doing,
in essence, exactly what one of

00:16:54.962 --> 00:16:57.000
these retroviruses does.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.765
This would give us what's known
as a cDNA library,

00:17:01.765 --> 00:17:05.850
where the genes don't have
introns anymore.

00:17:05.850 --> 00:17:10.129
So, if I wanted to get at one
of my proteins,

00:17:10.129 --> 00:17:14.506
one of my genes,
and think about expressing it

00:17:14.506 --> 00:17:17.618
in E.
coli, what I would do is go

00:17:17.618 --> 00:17:23.259
looking in a cDNA library using
a sort of approach as we've

00:17:23.259 --> 00:17:29.192
done, trying to find my gene of
interest, because if I use the

00:17:29.192 --> 00:17:36.000
cDNA library now it would just
be like a bacterial gene.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.609
You could see the ATG start.

00:17:37.609 --> 00:17:40.367
You could get out your handy
little genetic code,

00:17:40.367 --> 00:17:43.413
and you could walk along,
and read out the sequence of

00:17:43.413 --> 00:17:44.103
the protein.

00:17:44.103 --> 00:17:47.206
So, that's part of what you
need to do if you wanted to

00:17:47.206 --> 00:17:49.620
make, say, a protein inside of a
bacterium.

00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:52.954
The other one which we talked
about was since the promoters

00:17:52.954 --> 00:17:55.022
are not a universal language,
what E.

00:17:55.022 --> 00:17:58.241
coli RNA polymerase sees is
different than what human RNA

00:17:58.241 --> 00:18:01.000
polymerase sees as a start site.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:06.713
I would have to add in a
promoter that would drive the

00:18:06.713 --> 00:18:13.397
expression of this open reading
frame if I wanted it to work in

00:18:13.397 --> 00:18:14.152
E.
coli.

00:18:14.152 --> 00:18:17.817
And that's fairly easily done,
too.

00:18:17.817 --> 00:18:24.286
A general thing that's for this
is called expression cloning.

00:18:24.286 --> 00:18:30.000
And it would be more or less
the same idea.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.383
We'd have a vector that had a
cloning site.

00:18:33.383 --> 00:18:37.492
It has an origin of
replication, and maybe there's a

00:18:37.492 --> 00:18:41.118
selectable marker such as the
drug resistance.

00:18:41.118 --> 00:18:45.791
That's the basic kind of factor
that I talked about before.

00:18:45.791 --> 00:18:49.578
However, if I clone in a piece
of DNA into that,

00:18:49.578 --> 00:18:54.170
it has to have a promoter that
can be read in the organism

00:18:54.170 --> 00:18:57.635
working with,
because it's just out whatever

00:18:57.635 --> 00:19:01.341
nature gave it,
whatever promoter that would be

00:19:01.341 --> 00:19:04.000
in front of that.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:08.621
But, if I were to now into this
vector put an E.

00:19:08.621 --> 00:19:13.930
coli promoter right there,
now, if I just downstream of

00:19:13.930 --> 00:19:19.338
that put any open reading frame,
human protein lets say,

00:19:19.338 --> 00:19:25.139
which we've gotten rid of the
introns, the human genes minus

00:19:25.139 --> 00:19:29.858
its introns, which you got from
the cDNA library,

00:19:29.858 --> 00:19:34.184
now when the bacterial
polymerase came along,

00:19:34.184 --> 00:19:39.002
it would be copying,
making it a messenger RNA for

00:19:39.002 --> 00:19:42.935
human protein,
and we could get it out of

00:19:42.935 --> 00:19:45.000
that.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:50.888
And the beauty of that,
suppose we took the front part

00:19:50.888 --> 00:19:55.888
of the Lac operator,
we would have a regulated

00:19:55.888 --> 00:19:56.888
promoter.

00:19:56.888 --> 00:20:03.666
It would be just everything we
studied about Lac if we were to

00:20:03.666 --> 00:20:08.055
starve it for,
you know, we have to get rid of

00:20:08.055 --> 00:20:11.503
glucose, and then if we added
lactose or some kind of

00:20:11.503 --> 00:20:14.753
synthetic inducer,
we can turn the promoter on and

00:20:14.753 --> 00:20:15.018
off.

00:20:15.018 --> 00:20:18.599
So, you could grow an entire
fermenter load of bacteria

00:20:18.599 --> 00:20:20.456
without expressing the gene.

00:20:20.456 --> 00:20:23.639
And then, once you had the
bacteria all grown up,

00:20:23.639 --> 00:20:27.485
you could throw in something
that would normally induce the

00:20:27.485 --> 00:20:31.000
expression of the Lac regulatory
system.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.928
And now, instead of making beta
galactosidase,

00:20:33.928 --> 00:20:37.572
instead it would make the
protein that you are interested

00:20:37.572 --> 00:20:38.613
in, you with me?

00:20:38.613 --> 00:20:39.720
It's very pretty.

00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:42.453
And in fact,
so much of what you can see in

00:20:42.453 --> 00:20:46.097
this is, these really basic
studies, since the Lac system

00:20:46.097 --> 00:20:49.611
was one of the first to really
be worked out in detail,

00:20:49.611 --> 00:20:50.718
we use its parts.

00:20:50.718 --> 00:20:54.297
And, there are many vectors
around now that have exactly

00:20:54.297 --> 00:20:54.622
that.

00:20:54.622 --> 00:20:58.331
They have the Lac promoter,
and you can turn things on and

00:20:58.331 --> 00:21:04.750
off in a regulated way,
so not only provide a promoter

00:21:04.750 --> 00:21:12.000
that works in the organism,
but it also gives you a measure

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.375
of control.

00:21:13.375 --> 00:21:20.375
There's another very cute
trick, and what we've done sort

00:21:20.375 --> 00:21:26.250
of here is we took,
say, the promoter for Lac in

00:21:26.250 --> 00:21:30.000
the regulatory region.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:33.329
I'll use R to stand for
regulatory region,

00:21:33.329 --> 00:21:36.576
and then this would be the LacZ
sequence.

00:21:36.576 --> 00:21:40.555
What we've really done,
is we've taken a gene from

00:21:40.555 --> 00:21:44.290
somewhere else,
let's call it gene X that had a

00:21:44.290 --> 00:21:45.995
promoter from gene X.

00:21:45.995 --> 00:21:49.649
And, in essence,
is cutting each of them here.

00:21:49.649 --> 00:21:54.683
And, now we take the regulatory
promoter region from Lac and we

00:21:54.683 --> 00:21:56.713
put down below it gene X.

00:21:56.713 --> 00:22:01.504
And, now we've got this gene
whose products we're interested

00:22:01.504 --> 00:22:05.970
in producing in a fermenter
under the control of the Lac

00:22:05.970 --> 00:22:08.000
operon.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.090
Well, there's another kind of
thing we can do.

00:22:12.090 --> 00:22:14.909
We can do the other way around.

00:22:14.909 --> 00:22:19.454
We could take LacZ,
which makes beta galactosidase.

00:22:19.454 --> 00:22:24.363
We could put it under the
promoter regulatory region of

00:22:24.363 --> 00:22:25.000
gene X.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.545
Well, what will happen then?

00:22:27.545 --> 00:22:33.000
If that construct is sitting in
a cell, anytime that the cell

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:37.363
decides to make gene X,
instead it will make beta

00:22:37.363 --> 00:22:41.272
galactosidase,
which is really easy to assay

00:22:41.272 --> 00:22:43.000
for.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:52.333
And, this sort of strategy,
you'd use something like LacZ

00:22:52.333 --> 00:22:55.000
as a reporter.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:06.730
In this case beta galactosidase
synthesis, which you can assay

00:23:06.730 --> 00:23:15.384
for, reports when is the
promoter of gene X is

00:23:15.384 --> 00:23:17.692
functioning.

00:23:17.692 --> 00:23:29.423
This reporter gene now has the
regulatory characteristics that

00:23:29.423 --> 00:23:40.000
are imposed upon it by that
particular promoter.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:43.139
So, there's this picture that
I've showed you,

00:23:43.139 --> 00:23:45.860
this little movie I showed you
early on.

00:23:45.860 --> 00:23:48.093
You've seen it a couple of
times.

00:23:48.093 --> 00:23:50.465
In this case,
the reporter is green

00:23:50.465 --> 00:23:51.860
fluorescent protein.

00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:54.860
What Barbara Meyer,
who made this particular

00:23:54.860 --> 00:23:58.837
construct, did was they took the
gene for green florescent

00:23:58.837 --> 00:24:04.000
protein which started out in a
jellyfish as you may remember.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:09.342
And, the protein folds up,
and ends up being fluorescent.

00:24:09.342 --> 00:24:13.825
So, we can tell when it's
expressed very easily.

00:24:13.825 --> 00:24:18.118
And in this case,
you'll notice not all of the

00:24:18.118 --> 00:24:21.648
genes in the whole worm isn't
glowing.

00:24:21.648 --> 00:24:26.990
And so, it's under the control
of the promoter regulatory

00:24:26.990 --> 00:24:33.000
region that is expressed only in
specific body parts.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:36.250
And so, you can see where that
promoter is working by just

00:24:36.250 --> 00:24:37.390
looking at the worm.

00:24:37.390 --> 00:24:40.811
In the case of something like
the mouse that we talked about,

00:24:40.811 --> 00:24:43.833
it's a pretty uniform
expression at least in the skin.

00:24:43.833 --> 00:24:45.828
So, that was probably,
in that case,

00:24:45.828 --> 00:24:49.192
the green fluorescent protein
was probably put in a promoter

00:24:49.192 --> 00:24:52.500
that's expressed in probably
most of the cells in the body,

00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:55.293
at least certainly all the ones
in the mouse cell.

00:24:55.293 --> 00:24:57.118
I don't know the details of
that.

00:24:57.118 --> 00:24:59.000
Ditto over here.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:04.309
It was probably something that
was expressed in most of the

00:25:04.309 --> 00:25:09.985
body cells, but you also could
have put something that was just

00:25:09.985 --> 00:25:13.098
expressed in some very little
bits.

00:25:13.098 --> 00:25:18.591
So, depending on how you do the
construct, there are a lot of

00:25:18.591 --> 00:25:23.809
different things that people can
do in this sort of thing.

00:25:23.809 --> 00:25:29.028
OK, one more category that
comes out of the sort of thing,

00:25:29.028 --> 00:25:34.429
is if we have a gene of some
type, I don't know what it does

00:25:34.429 --> 00:25:38.000
but I'd like to find out.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:42.082
You know, at least budding
geneticists, know what we'd like

00:25:42.082 --> 00:25:42.504
to do.

00:25:42.504 --> 00:25:45.882
We'd probably just like to
disable that gene very

00:25:45.882 --> 00:25:48.557
specifically,
and then look at the live

00:25:48.557 --> 00:25:50.598
organism to see what happens.

00:25:50.598 --> 00:25:54.750
And, the principle is the same
whether you're doing it in E.

00:25:54.750 --> 00:25:55.876
coli or a mouse.

00:25:55.876 --> 00:25:59.114
It gets a little more
complicated for technical

00:25:59.114 --> 00:26:02.000
reasons doing it in a mouse.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.246
But the idea is exactly the
same.

00:26:04.246 --> 00:26:05.931
And here's the strategy.

00:26:05.931 --> 00:26:09.582
So, we'll just take a piece of
DNA from the organism.

00:26:09.582 --> 00:26:13.513
And sitting at here is this
open reading frame that we've

00:26:13.513 --> 00:26:13.864
seen.

00:26:13.864 --> 00:26:16.251
We don't know what its function
is.

00:26:16.251 --> 00:26:20.253
We think if I could knock it
out, get rid of its function,

00:26:20.253 --> 00:26:22.078
I'll look at the organism.

00:26:22.078 --> 00:26:24.184
Maybe I can make a guess then.

00:26:24.184 --> 00:26:28.256
So, if we were to cut the gene
somewhere with a restriction

00:26:28.256 --> 00:26:31.275
site, and then we were to take,
for example,

00:26:31.275 --> 00:26:34.785
a gene encoding a drug
resistance or something like

00:26:34.785 --> 00:26:38.928
that, and insert it at that
point, what we would end up with

00:26:38.928 --> 00:26:43.000
is this piece of the organism's
DNA.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:51.330
The first part of gene X,
then a drug resistance,

00:26:51.330 --> 00:27:01.743
then the last part of gene X,
and some more sequence from the

00:27:01.743 --> 00:27:04.000
organism.

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:08.254
Now, this would be,
we'd have this in a test tube.

00:27:08.254 --> 00:27:13.289
We could do it by the kind of
recombinant DNA manipulations

00:27:13.289 --> 00:27:14.418
that we have.

00:27:14.418 --> 00:27:19.800
And what would happen if I were
to put, now, let's keep it with

00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:22.578
bacteria where it's easy to see.

00:27:22.578 --> 00:27:27.614
If I were to take that piece of
DNA, put it inside a living

00:27:27.614 --> 00:27:31.000
cell, what's going to happen?

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:37.566
Well, let's make this,
say, here's the end of it.

00:27:37.566 --> 00:27:40.438
That's all we've got.

00:27:40.438 --> 00:27:48.235
Well, inside the living cell,
we of course have the entire

00:27:48.235 --> 00:27:49.193
genome.

00:27:49.193 --> 00:27:53.297
And then we come to this part.

00:27:53.297 --> 00:27:55.349
We have gene X.

00:27:55.349 --> 00:28:00.000
Then we'd have this going.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.242
That would be the whole thing.

00:28:02.242 --> 00:28:06.130
Well, this particular piece
doesn't have an origin of

00:28:06.130 --> 00:28:07.028
replication.

00:28:07.028 --> 00:28:09.121
It's not joined to a vector.

00:28:09.121 --> 00:28:10.915
It's just sitting there.

00:28:10.915 --> 00:28:14.280
So, if the cell divides,
it's not going to get

00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:15.102
replicated.

00:28:15.102 --> 00:28:19.364
So, if I select for a drug
resistance that's on that piece

00:28:19.364 --> 00:28:23.401
of DNA, unless something happens
I'm not going to get a

00:28:23.401 --> 00:28:25.196
drug-resistant bacteria.

00:28:25.196 --> 00:28:29.906
But you do know a way that this
thing could join to an origin of

00:28:29.906 --> 00:28:32.000
replication.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:36.298
It could join to the origin of
replication that's on the

00:28:36.298 --> 00:28:37.862
bacteria chromosome.

00:28:37.862 --> 00:28:41.848
And, the way to do it would be
by undergoing genetic

00:28:41.848 --> 00:28:46.147
recombination over here,
because this DNA is exactly the

00:28:46.147 --> 00:28:49.898
same as on that side,
and over here it's the same

00:28:49.898 --> 00:28:50.367
thing.

00:28:50.367 --> 00:28:52.947
This DNA is the same as that
side.

00:28:52.947 --> 00:28:57.324
So, if that genetic exchange
happened, what would happen,

00:28:57.324 --> 00:29:01.544
even if it happened rarely,
was this piece of DNA would

00:29:01.544 --> 00:29:06.000
replace the piece of DNA that's
in there.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:09.856
I'd be able to tell it was
there because I'd just select

00:29:09.856 --> 00:29:11.259
for drug resistance.

00:29:11.259 --> 00:29:15.045
And even if it only happened
only one in 500,000 cells,

00:29:15.045 --> 00:29:19.323
it wouldn't matter because up
would growth the colony that now

00:29:19.323 --> 00:29:21.847
has the drug in the middle of
gene X.

00:29:21.847 --> 00:29:24.512
Gene X is gone,
and I could look at the

00:29:24.512 --> 00:29:29.000
organism if it's alive and see
if it has a phenotype.

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:32.936
If it's an essential gene,
that strategy obviously won't

00:29:32.936 --> 00:29:37.160
work, and when people do the
more complicated thing of doing

00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:40.738
this kind of experiment to make
a transgenic mouse,

00:29:40.738 --> 00:29:44.747
it takes about a year to go
from our DNA manipulation all

00:29:44.747 --> 00:29:48.111
the way to the live mouse with a
disrupted gene.

00:29:48.111 --> 00:29:52.406
And sometimes what they find
after spending half of your PhD.

00:29:52.406 --> 00:29:54.839
is that that was an essential
gene.

00:29:54.839 --> 00:29:58.705
And, there's no live mouse,
or it made it two days into

00:29:58.705 --> 00:30:03.000
being an embryo and it tanked at
that point.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:05.075
But, this again,
you could see,

00:30:05.075 --> 00:30:08.466
we talked about going back and
forth between gene,

00:30:08.466 --> 00:30:11.372
protein, and trying to figure
out function.

00:30:11.372 --> 00:30:15.386
All I can sort of do is give
you the flavor of what's going

00:30:15.386 --> 00:30:15.593
on.

00:30:15.593 --> 00:30:19.607
But one sort of overarching
thing I hope you remember going

00:30:19.607 --> 00:30:23.343
through this is DNA sequencing,
PCR, all these kinds of

00:30:23.343 --> 00:30:27.357
manipulations we're talking
about are just exploiting these

00:30:27.357 --> 00:30:31.232
basic cellular components that
we learned about studying,

00:30:31.232 --> 00:30:34.000
how does DNA replicate?

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:35.963
How is information coded?

00:30:35.963 --> 00:30:38.083
How do genes get expressed?

00:30:38.083 --> 00:30:42.324
How does genetic information
gets sorted between cells?

00:30:42.324 --> 00:30:46.408
It's simply applying those
relatively well understood

00:30:46.408 --> 00:30:50.806
tools, or sort of biological
principles and parts that we

00:30:50.806 --> 00:30:54.261
learned about,
and now using them as tools in

00:30:54.261 --> 00:30:57.638
an engineering way,
and have just completely

00:30:57.638 --> 00:31:02.272
transformed the way biology has
been done in the last couple

00:31:02.272 --> 00:31:04.000
decades.

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:09.115
And it's just,
as I say, things are changing

00:31:09.115 --> 00:31:10.542
so, so fast.

00:31:10.542 --> 00:31:13.516
It's almost breathtaking.

00:31:13.516 --> 00:31:20.535
So, the last little bit of sort
of technique oriented stuff,

00:31:20.535 --> 00:31:27.197
I just want to at least make
sure I've mentioned what are

00:31:27.197 --> 00:31:29.457
called microarrays.

00:31:29.457 --> 00:31:36.000
You often hear these referred
to as DNA chips.

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:39.616
The principle here is this is a
way that lets you ask,

00:31:39.616 --> 00:31:43.574
not only whether one gene is
being expressed or not under a

00:31:43.574 --> 00:31:47.055
particular condition,
whether its RNA is being made,

00:31:47.055 --> 00:31:49.989
and in most cases that means
making protein,

00:31:49.989 --> 00:31:52.923
or whether it's off,
or whether it's at some

00:31:52.923 --> 00:31:54.220
intermediate level.

00:31:54.220 --> 00:31:57.632
A microarray lets you do that
experiment with many,

00:31:57.632 --> 00:31:59.338
many, many genes at once.

00:31:59.338 --> 00:32:02.000
And here's the principle.

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:10.543
You take some surface,
and there will be a bunch of,

00:32:10.543 --> 00:32:16.071
if you will,
sites on the surface,

00:32:16.071 --> 00:32:20.258
on this chip or whatever.

00:32:20.258 --> 00:32:29.304
And, what will go to be
attached here would be a little

00:32:29.304 --> 00:32:35.000
piece of DNA from gene one.

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:41.323
I mean, let's say,
maybe a hundred nucleotides:

00:32:41.323 --> 00:32:48.883
that would be far more than
enough to make it absolutely

00:32:48.883 --> 00:32:56.718
specific that they could only
hybridize to a messenger RNA

00:32:56.718 --> 00:33:02.353
from gene one,
and not from anything else.

00:33:02.353 --> 00:33:08.539
And, this one,
then, would have from gene two,

00:33:08.539 --> 00:33:15.000
this one, from gene three,
and so on.

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:30.000
Then, if we were to take a
messenger RNA preparation from,

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:34.888
say, an organism if it's a
little one, or maybe a tissue,

00:33:34.888 --> 00:33:39.515
or something like that,
anywhere you could isolate RNA

00:33:39.515 --> 00:33:39.952
from.

00:33:39.952 --> 00:33:43.793
And then, we'll label it in
some kind of way,

00:33:43.793 --> 00:33:46.674
and we can label it
radioactivity,

00:33:46.674 --> 00:33:48.944
we can label it with dyes.

00:33:48.944 --> 00:33:53.658
It's usually done with dyes,
and there are a variety of

00:33:53.658 --> 00:33:55.317
variations on this.

00:33:55.317 --> 00:33:59.507
Those are sort of technical
details how to do it.

00:33:59.507 --> 00:34:03.000
But here's the principle.

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:07.701
Let's just, for the moment,
just consider that it's got a

00:34:07.701 --> 00:34:08.708
label on it.

00:34:08.708 --> 00:34:13.493
So if we take the messenger
RNA, and take this little chip

00:34:13.493 --> 00:34:18.614
that has samples in the extreme,
it could be a sample of every

00:34:18.614 --> 00:34:22.728
single gene that's in the genome
of that organism,

00:34:22.728 --> 00:34:27.345
we take this labeled RNA,
actually what we would usually

00:34:27.345 --> 00:34:31.711
do is to use this to make a
labeled cDNA preparation,

00:34:31.711 --> 00:34:37.000
which would be a copy of each
one of these things.

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:40.773
That the technically easy way
to get label into it.

00:34:40.773 --> 00:34:45.226
But what we do have is if the
gene was on, its messenger RNA

00:34:45.226 --> 00:34:49.679
would be on, and we'd have a
bunch of stuff corresponding to

00:34:49.679 --> 00:34:51.943
gene one that had label on it.

00:34:51.943 --> 00:34:55.188
And if we give it a chance,
that will, then,

00:34:55.188 --> 00:34:56.320
hybridize here.

00:34:56.320 --> 00:35:01.000
And there would be some way of
detecting this label.

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:04.974
If gene two was off in that
sample, there won't be any

00:35:04.974 --> 00:35:06.025
hybridization.

00:35:06.025 --> 00:35:07.974
There won't be any signal.

00:35:07.974 --> 00:35:11.875
You can sort of see in
principle what you're doing is

00:35:11.875 --> 00:35:15.250
you're interrogating each gene
in the extreme,

00:35:15.250 --> 00:35:18.699
each gene in the organism under
some condition.

00:35:18.699 --> 00:35:19.375
Is it on?

00:35:19.375 --> 00:35:20.125
Is it off?

00:35:20.125 --> 00:35:24.474
If you did various samples,
and you could see maybe it's in

00:35:24.474 --> 00:35:28.000
an intermediate level,
and so on.

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:31.965
So, the chips look like that,
50-100,000 genes perhaps,

00:35:31.965 --> 00:35:33.434
something like that.

00:35:33.434 --> 00:35:35.637
These things are really small.

00:35:35.637 --> 00:35:39.749
Here's sort of a display of a
simple one, and this is one

00:35:39.749 --> 00:35:41.585
where they're taking RNA.

00:35:41.585 --> 00:35:44.155
The samples are from two
conditions.

00:35:44.155 --> 00:35:48.708
One's labeled with a dye that's
green, and one's labeled with a

00:35:48.708 --> 00:35:49.809
dye that's red.

00:35:49.809 --> 00:35:53.187
And, if you get equal amounts,
it looks yellow.

00:35:53.187 --> 00:35:57.520
So, they mix the two things
together, and if the gene is the

00:35:57.520 --> 00:36:02.000
same under two conditions it
would be yellow.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:05.400
Under one condition,
if the gene was on in condition

00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:08.199
one than it would be green,
and off in two,

00:36:08.199 --> 00:36:09.466
and back and forth.

00:36:09.466 --> 00:36:13.466
So, without trying to get lost
in the technical details right

00:36:13.466 --> 00:36:17.199
now, which doesn't matter,
the principle of this thing is

00:36:17.199 --> 00:36:19.466
that you can take,
you can sort of,

00:36:19.466 --> 00:36:23.266
by making a preparation of RNA,
then you can use these DNA

00:36:23.266 --> 00:36:25.800
chips and say,
is each gene on and off?

00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:30.000
Or if I switch conditions,
who comes on and off?

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.932
So, it's a little like,
I think of it this way.

00:36:32.932 --> 00:36:35.673
It's like having,
all right, who's on today?

00:36:35.673 --> 00:36:38.286
And a number of hands go up,
or something.

00:36:38.286 --> 00:36:40.326
And the rest of you would be
off.

00:36:40.326 --> 00:36:43.768
But, come back on Monday,
and I say to the something or

00:36:43.768 --> 00:36:47.083
other, and a different set of
you would put up hands.

00:36:47.083 --> 00:36:50.908
And what I'm kind of looking at
are the changes between that.

00:36:50.908 --> 00:36:54.286
And the sort of thing where
this has been so powerful,

00:36:54.286 --> 00:36:56.836
for example,
is there are kind of cancers

00:36:56.836 --> 00:37:02.000
for which there is a treatment,
but it was only 20% successful.

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:06.928
And, when people started to
study these cancers and then

00:37:06.928 --> 00:37:12.304
looked to see what genes were
on, what they realized was even

00:37:12.304 --> 00:37:17.591
though physicians had given
these cancers a particular name,

00:37:17.591 --> 00:37:21.982
if you looked at which genes
were being expressed,

00:37:21.982 --> 00:37:27.000
they fell into two classes,
class A and class B.

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:30.625
And what they then realized was
that the treatment they were

00:37:30.625 --> 00:37:33.391
using was 100% effective of
tumors of class A,

00:37:33.391 --> 00:37:36.525
and wasn't doing anything for
the tumors of class B.

00:37:36.525 --> 00:37:40.150
The physician couldn't tell the
difference between these two

00:37:40.150 --> 00:37:42.854
types of tumors,
but a microarray can say it.

00:37:42.854 --> 00:37:46.664
And once you have that kind of
insight, if somebody has a tumor

00:37:46.664 --> 00:37:49.122
of the type A,
you can use the treatment.

00:37:49.122 --> 00:37:50.351
It's very effective.

00:37:50.351 --> 00:37:52.932
And of course,
when people are trying to do

00:37:52.932 --> 00:37:56.497
now would be to develop an
equivalently effective treatment

00:37:56.497 --> 00:38:00.000
for something for the tumor of
type B.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:04.242
So, again we have so little
time in this class.

00:38:04.242 --> 00:38:07.194
I could go on basically for
ages.

00:38:07.194 --> 00:38:11.529
There's the output of the real
sort of DNA chip.

00:38:11.529 --> 00:38:16.878
You can see things are very
dense, and the great cleverness

00:38:16.878 --> 00:38:21.582
in doing these things,
people now use the technology

00:38:21.582 --> 00:38:27.208
that goes with LaserJet printers
to actually synthesize little

00:38:27.208 --> 00:38:32.742
pieces of either DNA or proteins
starting on a little spot on

00:38:32.742 --> 00:38:35.417
each membrane,
or on the chip,

00:38:35.417 --> 00:38:38.000
or whatever.

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:41.652
You put it on one nucleotide
and then you put it on the next,

00:38:41.652 --> 00:38:43.234
and the next,
and the next.

00:38:43.234 --> 00:38:46.826
You could sequence it using
technology that's already around

00:38:46.826 --> 00:38:49.321
for inkjet printers at that kind
of thing.

00:38:49.321 --> 00:38:53.095
So here you've seen a fusion of
different types of engineering.

00:38:53.095 --> 00:38:56.808
OK, the last thing I'm going to
tell you about is a little bit

00:38:56.808 --> 00:38:59.000
about the immune system.

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:00.544
We've run into this.

00:39:00.544 --> 00:39:05.101
This is a movie that some of
you liked, got the biggest aw I

00:39:05.101 --> 00:39:08.422
think of the last part of the
course anyway.

00:39:08.422 --> 00:39:13.211
But what we are seeing here is
a white blood cell pushing aside

00:39:13.211 --> 00:39:16.455
from red blood cells,
which are stationary,

00:39:16.455 --> 00:39:18.308
and chasing a bacterium.

00:39:18.308 --> 00:39:20.857
It's obvious that it can trace
it.

00:39:20.857 --> 00:39:24.951
It's able to recognize some
things, and at some point,

00:39:24.951 --> 00:39:26.495
then, it took it up.

00:39:26.495 --> 00:39:31.207
The principle of what happened
there was this white blood cell

00:39:31.207 --> 00:39:37.000
had a capacity to recognize the
bacteria, then bind to it.

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:42.354
And then, its membrane,
this is the membrane,

00:39:42.354 --> 00:39:46.126
and this is a white blood cell.

00:39:46.126 --> 00:39:52.820
There's many types of these,
and it pinches the membrane

00:39:52.820 --> 00:39:53.306
off.

00:39:53.306 --> 00:39:56.470
So you have the bacterium.

00:39:56.470 --> 00:40:00.000
This is the bacterium.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:03.120
And, it's inside a little
membrane compartment,

00:40:03.120 --> 00:40:06.172
as if the bacteria is in a
little soap bubble.

00:40:06.172 --> 00:40:09.971
And the principle of what
happens is the white blood cell

00:40:09.971 --> 00:40:13.024
has another soap bubble that's
full of poison.

00:40:13.024 --> 00:40:16.822
And, if you took two soap
bubbles and push them together,

00:40:16.822 --> 00:40:18.315
you know what happens.

00:40:18.315 --> 00:40:21.096
They'll fuse,
and you'll get a bigger soap

00:40:21.096 --> 00:40:21.571
bubble.

00:40:21.571 --> 00:40:24.962
And that's, in essence,
how these white blood cells

00:40:24.962 --> 00:40:26.522
normally kill bacteria.

00:40:26.522 --> 00:40:31.000
They would bring together these
two compartments.

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:36.325
Now you have a bacteria and a
poison within a white blood cell

00:40:36.325 --> 00:40:39.293
at the bacterium,
would get killed.

00:40:39.293 --> 00:40:43.134
And we talked about how
bacteria fought back.

00:40:43.134 --> 00:40:46.888
That was a streptococcus that
has a capsule.

00:40:46.888 --> 00:40:50.992
And the capsule,
by having polysaccharide on the

00:40:50.992 --> 00:40:56.230
outside, prevent the white blood
cell from being able to grab

00:40:56.230 --> 00:41:00.857
hold of some feature of the
bacteria, that starts this

00:41:00.857 --> 00:41:04.000
process of killing it.

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:07.676
And when I told you the story
of how DNA was found,

00:41:07.676 --> 00:41:10.029
it was people studying
pneumonia.

00:41:10.029 --> 00:41:12.750
If you remember,
it was streptococcus.

00:41:12.750 --> 00:41:16.794
If the streptococcus had a
capsule, and the people would

00:41:16.794 --> 00:41:17.823
get very sick.

00:41:17.823 --> 00:41:21.941
And after five or six days,
there would be a crisis where

00:41:21.941 --> 00:41:24.220
they either lived,
or they died.

00:41:24.220 --> 00:41:27.308
And what would happen in that
time is that,

00:41:27.308 --> 00:41:31.132
the last thing I'll tell you
about, what's called the

00:41:31.132 --> 00:41:34.808
adaptive immune system would
have generated special

00:41:34.808 --> 00:41:38.779
recognition molecules called
antibodies that would have

00:41:38.779 --> 00:41:44.000
learns to recognize the capsule
at that bacterium.

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:48.793
And once those were there,
now those white blood cells

00:41:48.793 --> 00:41:53.316
would be able to capture the
bacterium, because the

00:41:53.316 --> 00:41:58.653
antibodies give it a hand in
recognizing there was something

00:41:58.653 --> 00:42:02.000
there that needed to be killed.

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:05.521
The way this adaptive immune
system works,

00:42:05.521 --> 00:42:08.269
it's almost like science
fiction.

00:42:08.269 --> 00:42:11.963
And I'll tell you the molecular
basis of it.

00:42:11.963 --> 00:42:15.484
The key insight came from
Susumu Tonegawa,

00:42:15.484 --> 00:42:19.006
another member of the MIT
faculty biology,

00:42:19.006 --> 00:42:23.644
and also runs Picower Center,
who got a Nobel Prize for

00:42:23.644 --> 00:42:30.000
understanding the basis of the
diversity of the immune system.

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:34.949
What I just want to do for the
moment is just sort of point out

00:42:34.949 --> 00:42:39.099
the key features of what's
called the adaptive immune

00:42:39.099 --> 00:42:39.658
system.

00:42:39.658 --> 00:42:44.048
And this is one of the reasons
that we are able to live.

00:42:44.048 --> 00:42:47.640
And even though we get sick
from time to time,

00:42:47.640 --> 00:42:52.190
and we've all had one thing or
another get us for a little

00:42:52.190 --> 00:42:56.580
while during the semester,
the reason we aren't sick all

00:42:56.580 --> 00:43:00.731
the time, and the reason we
recover when we get sick,

00:43:00.731 --> 00:43:06.000
as we have what's called an
adaptive immune system.

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:10.192
What happens when people get
infected with HIV virus is the

00:43:10.192 --> 00:43:14.385
cells that it lives in and
destroys are key players in your

00:43:14.385 --> 00:43:16.048
adaptive immune system.

00:43:16.048 --> 00:43:20.240
And to some people don't die
from the H1V infection itself,

00:43:20.240 --> 00:43:23.493
they died because lots of
things that we just,

00:43:23.493 --> 00:43:27.036
bacteria or fungi,
whatever things we just have on

00:43:27.036 --> 00:43:31.590
us and we live with all the time
suddenly become killers because

00:43:31.590 --> 00:43:36.000
you lack the immune system that
fights them off.

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:42.773
So the so-called adaptive
immune system is absolutely

00:43:42.773 --> 00:43:43.815
amazing.

00:43:43.815 --> 00:43:49.285
So several features,
it's got an incredible

00:43:49.285 --> 00:43:56.710
diversity, there is a general
word that's used to describe

00:43:56.710 --> 00:44:02.310
some sort of all sorts of
chemical entities,

00:44:02.310 --> 00:44:07.000
and it's called an antigen.

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:10.928
So anyway, this can recognize
many, many what are called

00:44:10.928 --> 00:44:11.571
antigens.

00:44:11.571 --> 00:44:15.785
And at the moment I think you
can just think of them as some

00:44:15.785 --> 00:44:17.500
kind of chemical entity.

00:44:17.500 --> 00:44:19.428
It could be a carbohydrate.

00:44:19.428 --> 00:44:22.928
It could be a little piece of
an organic molecule.

00:44:22.928 --> 00:44:25.928
It could be a few amino acids
on a protein.

00:44:25.928 --> 00:44:29.714
But it's something that's
potentially capable of being

00:44:29.714 --> 00:44:33.000
recognized by your immune
system.

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:36.022
So, there are many,
many, many things.

00:44:36.022 --> 00:44:40.923
And the amazing thing is I can
go into a lab and synthesize a

00:44:40.923 --> 00:44:45.416
molecule that's never been seen
on this Earth before and

00:44:45.416 --> 00:44:49.909
challenge somebody with it,
and you'll produce an immune

00:44:49.909 --> 00:44:54.647
response that will be mounted
against that even though it's

00:44:54.647 --> 00:44:56.853
never been on Earth before.

00:44:56.853 --> 00:44:58.977
It's also the specificity.

00:44:58.977 --> 00:45:02.000
It is completely amazing.

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:07.555
If I were to take a protein,
and then, let's say,

00:45:07.555 --> 00:45:12.185
put on a phenyl ring with a
methyl there,

00:45:12.185 --> 00:45:18.319
inject it into someone,
the immune system would figure

00:45:18.319 --> 00:45:24.337
out how to recognize this thing
with the phenyl ring,

00:45:24.337 --> 00:45:27.000
and the methyl.

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:32.246
But, the response it generated,
it would see this but not,

00:45:32.246 --> 00:45:36.941
let's say, that if I wanted to
get an immune system,

00:45:36.941 --> 00:45:42.096
something with methyl here,
I'd have to put that into the

00:45:42.096 --> 00:45:47.251
organism and let the immune
system figure out a response.

00:45:47.251 --> 00:45:52.774
So, the specificity is at the
same kind of level that you are

00:45:52.774 --> 00:45:53.970
used to here.

00:45:53.970 --> 00:45:59.493
If restriction enzymes can read
different sequences in DNA or

00:45:59.493 --> 00:46:04.924
protein can tell one optical
isomer of a small molecule from

00:46:04.924 --> 00:46:11.000
another, it's this fitting of
complementary shapes.

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:15.357
So, with the immune system is
all about is figuring out how to

00:46:15.357 --> 00:46:19.428
get a complementary shape
somehow that's able to recognize

00:46:19.428 --> 00:46:23.642
essentially any kind of chemical
shape and structure you can

00:46:23.642 --> 00:46:24.285
think of.

00:46:24.285 --> 00:46:25.928
It's just mind blowing.

00:46:25.928 --> 00:46:29.571
And, you could already see
right from the beginning,

00:46:29.571 --> 00:46:33.428
where the fundamental problem
people could see from the

00:46:33.428 --> 00:46:35.000
beginning.

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:39.270
It sounds like we would need a
genome that's infinitely big,

00:46:39.270 --> 00:46:42.962
full of things that are ready
to recognize anything.

00:46:42.962 --> 00:46:45.568
And so, one of the real
surprises is,

00:46:45.568 --> 00:46:48.970
and now we know,
is there is 20,000 genes are so

00:46:48.970 --> 00:46:50.418
in the human genome.

00:46:50.418 --> 00:46:53.241
There can't possibly be a
zillion genes,

00:46:53.241 --> 00:46:56.498
each one specific for one of
these structures.

00:46:56.498 --> 00:47:02.000
There had to be some underlying
principle that we had to learn.

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:07.255
And that was one of the big
challenges in the immune system

00:47:07.255 --> 00:47:08.704
for a long time.

00:47:08.704 --> 00:47:13.869
Another one was that if you
have an organism that has this

00:47:13.869 --> 00:47:17.130
capacity, and you could
recognize it,

00:47:17.130 --> 00:47:19.758
why don't you do yourself in?

00:47:19.758 --> 00:47:24.469
Because you yourself are full
of entities that could,

00:47:24.469 --> 00:47:29.000
in principle,
generate an immune system.

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:35.777
So, one of the other things the
immune system had to deal with

00:47:35.777 --> 00:47:39.111
was avoiding self recognition.

00:47:39.111 --> 00:47:45.222
If you're able to recognize
anything, how do I not avoid

00:47:45.222 --> 00:47:47.666
killing my own selves?

00:47:47.666 --> 00:47:53.555
So, that is another really
fundamental problem in this

00:47:53.555 --> 00:47:55.111
immune system.

00:47:55.111 --> 00:47:58.000
This is exciting.

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:02.717
We can all stop and watch,
but I think I'll just try and

00:48:02.717 --> 00:48:06.748
keep soldiering along for the
last minute or so.

00:48:06.748 --> 00:48:11.723
So, one other feature that was
interesting about the immune

00:48:11.723 --> 00:48:14.039
system, is it has a memory.

00:48:14.039 --> 00:48:19.014
And I'll tell you more about
antibodies at the beginning of

00:48:19.014 --> 00:48:20.129
next lecture.

00:48:20.129 --> 00:48:24.418
But, these are the kinds of
molecule that's able to

00:48:24.418 --> 00:48:27.334
recognize these different
entities.

00:48:27.334 --> 00:48:31.709
And you've all heard the term
in your ordinary life.

00:48:31.709 --> 00:48:37.027
But, if we look at the level of
antibodies that are made in the

00:48:37.027 --> 00:48:42.626
body,
if the first exposure to an

00:48:42.626 --> 00:48:50.955
antigen that would get some kind
of response that comes up upon

00:48:50.955 --> 00:48:57.000
the first exposure,
and this is time here.

00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:02.599
If we let there be some delay,
it could be even into years,

00:49:02.599 --> 00:49:07.039
and then we get a second
exposure, the antigen,

00:49:07.039 --> 00:49:09.742
the response is much higher.

00:49:09.742 --> 00:49:12.638
And this could be a log scale.

00:49:12.638 --> 00:49:16.017
So, it could be dramatically
higher.

00:49:16.017 --> 00:49:19.009
So, what was the basis of that?

00:49:19.009 --> 00:49:20.650
How does it work?

00:49:20.650 --> 00:49:25.863
You see right there the
principle of vaccination in the

00:49:25.863 --> 00:49:30.304
sense that if you ever got
chickenpox as a kid,

00:49:30.304 --> 00:49:36.000
your body has learned how to
make antibodies.

00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:39.717
So if you ever see it again,
it mounts a really big immune

00:49:39.717 --> 00:49:40.304
response.

00:49:40.304 --> 00:49:44.217
If you want to have a disease
something like tetanus that you

00:49:44.217 --> 00:49:46.956
haven't seen,
you go to the doctor and they

00:49:46.956 --> 00:49:50.608
squirt and a bit of the stuff
that doesn't make you sick,

00:49:50.608 --> 00:49:53.478
but it gives you the initial
immune response.

00:49:53.478 --> 00:49:56.934
Then, if you ever step on a
rusty nail, you get a very

00:49:56.934 --> 00:50:00.000
powerful response against
tetanus.

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:04.153
And that sort of the underlying
principle of vaccination is this

00:50:04.153 --> 00:50:05.340
concept of memory.

00:50:05.340 --> 00:50:07.384
We'll pick that up on
Wednesday.

00:50:07.384 --> 00:50:09.850
So, have a great Patriots Day
weekend.
