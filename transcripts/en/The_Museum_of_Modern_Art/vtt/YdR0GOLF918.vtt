00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.586
You see the one
that says Ebony on the bottom right?

00:00:04.088 --> 00:00:05.590
It's got the JET magazines.

00:00:05.798 --> 00:00:07.550
Oh, it's not JET magazines.

00:00:07.925 --> 00:00:10.748
It's buttons,
but here's the JET magazines,

00:00:10.886 --> 00:00:14.390
the magazines that I used
to do the original Unbranded series.

00:00:19.853 --> 00:00:22.106
Looking at an advertisement
from a certain period of time

00:00:22.273 --> 00:00:24.108
is like hopping into a time machine

00:00:24.275 --> 00:00:26.531
because the only way
that you can really understand it

00:00:26.693 --> 00:00:29.530
is to go back into the mindset
of that time.

00:00:29.821 --> 00:00:31.093
Here's Maya Rudolph.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.768
Her father, Dick Rudolph,
was married to Minnie Ripperton,

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:35.421
a famous African American.

00:00:35.588 --> 00:00:37.246
Interracial marriage
wasn't even legal in a lot

00:00:37.413 --> 00:00:40.791
of the United States
when this picture was taken.

00:00:41.083 --> 00:00:45.755
Real ads are fascinating to me
because they speak to large groups

00:00:45.963 --> 00:00:48.288
of imaginary people.

00:00:48.425 --> 00:00:49.423
African American women,

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.431
who were the poorest demographic
by and large,

00:00:52.598 --> 00:00:54.263
are wearing like haute couture.

00:00:56.306 --> 00:00:59.976
Advertising plays a huge role
in our notion of how we see ourselves

00:01:00.145 --> 00:01:01.436
and how we see other people.

00:01:03.021 --> 00:01:04.690
We say, “You can't
judge a book by its cover,”

00:01:04.856 --> 00:01:07.860
but then we go about
training everyone to judge books

00:01:08.026 --> 00:01:08.695
by their covers,

00:01:08.861 --> 00:01:11.696
and advertising relies on prejudice.

00:01:11.863 --> 00:01:14.200
These kinds of people
care about these kinds of issues,

00:01:14.366 --> 00:01:16.911
so we will speak to them
in this kind of way.

00:01:17.703 --> 00:01:19.421
I was doing a project called Branded

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.356
where I was making images
that looked like ads,

00:01:22.523 --> 00:01:26.003
but making them as a commentary
on the present moment in history.

00:01:27.671 --> 00:01:28.933
The way the Unbranded project started

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.040
is I just thought by removing
all the text and logos,

00:01:33.176 --> 00:01:35.138
you could see
what's really being sold.

00:01:36.555 --> 00:01:38.190
This is one of the pictures
from 1987,

00:01:38.348 --> 00:01:39.508
and when I unbranded it,

00:01:39.641 --> 00:01:42.321
it starts to be
a little bit more curious

00:01:42.478 --> 00:01:45.606
about what's really
for sale in this image.

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.381
It's funny looking at the difference
in the printing styles

00:01:48.526 --> 00:01:51.821
because I must have gotten it
from a different 1987 magazine.

00:01:52.071 --> 00:01:53.253
As an African American male,

00:01:53.405 --> 00:01:57.118
I was always conflicted
with the monolithic images

00:01:57.326 --> 00:01:59.036
that society was creating.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:04.541
There's a lot of humor in there
for me particularly because it's like

00:02:05.335 --> 00:02:06.718
I have a crystal ball.

00:02:06.885 --> 00:02:12.175
I can look into the future
of the people who made these ads.

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.358
To me, sometimes the text is
as interesting, if not more,

00:02:15.511 --> 00:02:15.985
than the pictures.

00:02:16.136 --> 00:02:19.381
But as I said, it distracts you
from what's really for sale.

00:02:19.548 --> 00:02:22.810
And then there's irony,
“What makes OJ run?”

00:02:25.061 --> 00:02:26.551
All you do is just look around.

00:02:26.688 --> 00:02:28.686
That's what to me
is like the amazing experience.

00:02:28.816 --> 00:02:29.758
Oh my God!

00:02:30.276 --> 00:02:32.153
–So can you see what I see?
–No.

00:02:33.486 --> 00:02:35.823
I feel it's important
that we take responsibility

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:37.491
in actually minding
and looking at the images

00:02:37.658 --> 00:02:38.993
that our society is creating

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.871
so we can really get
a broader perspective of our time.

00:02:43.623 --> 00:02:45.123
Do you see this one over here?

00:02:45.875 --> 00:02:47.793
–Hold it up?
–Yeah you can just...

00:02:48.418 --> 00:02:49.420
Ah, wow!

00:03:01.015 --> 00:03:01.933
By looking at ads,

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:06.621
which are seen as more objective
than an individual artist's work,

00:03:06.788 --> 00:03:09.981
no single person can
take responsibility for an ad.

00:03:10.148 --> 00:03:11.858
There's an art director,
there's a photographer,

00:03:12.026 --> 00:03:14.623
but it really comes as consensus
because there's focus groups

00:03:14.778 --> 00:03:17.561
that are telling them
“This is what we want to see.”

00:03:17.698 --> 00:03:20.351
You can tell what era
an advertisement is from

00:03:20.493 --> 00:03:23.006
because it reflects something
of that moment that is bigger

00:03:23.161 --> 00:03:24.038
–than an image.
–Right.

00:03:24.205 --> 00:03:26.873
Looking at the ads
from these things is so fascinating

00:03:27.041 --> 00:03:28.918
because ads
are about hopes and dreams,

00:03:29.085 --> 00:03:33.380
but look at this one,
you know, like... that message.
