00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:02.701
Hey,

2
00:00:02.701 --> 00:00:06.810
what's going on is bill burr and it's time for the Monday morning podcast for

3
00:00:06.811 --> 00:00:10.210
Monday,
June mm seventies

4
00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:13.520
2019.
What's going on out?

5
00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:20.180
How are you everybody happy belated father's Day to you.

6
00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:24.500
Happy belated father's day to you.
Woo Woo,
Woo.

7
00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.190
Happy Belated suthers day to all the dads.

8
00:00:29.191 --> 00:00:33.180
You probably didn't get shipped it.
Okay.

9
00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:34.930
Happy belated father's day to everybody.

10
00:00:34.931 --> 00:00:36.370
I'm actually recording this on father's day,

11
00:00:36.371 --> 00:00:38.320
so I have no idea what my father's day is going to be.

12
00:00:38.321 --> 00:00:41.690
I think it's going to be a good one.
I'm doing the podcast earlier because,
uh,

13
00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:44.560
my lovely families taken me and my father on law outflow.

14
00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:49.580
Nice fucking steak dinner or with a killing the cows that I said I was going to

15
00:00:50.491 --> 00:00:54.420
try to stop eating.
I was going to eat a little bit less,
you know,

16
00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.450
and then what do you do?
Am I going to eat fish?
The fish are all going away.

17
00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.530
And then I read in that Howard Stern,
uh,

18
00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:04.220
interview in rolling stone dead.
His white cell count.

19
00:01:04.221 --> 00:01:07.130
I forget if it,
if it goes up or down,
I forget what it was.

20
00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.770
And they thought he had cancer and they were going to give them chemotherapy and

21
00:01:09.771 --> 00:01:13.180
it turned out he was eating too much fucking fish and the and all kinds of

22
00:01:13.181 --> 00:01:16.450
things.
Yet,
although this fucking mercury in them,
they almost gave him chemo.

23
00:01:16.451 --> 00:01:20.350
So I what,
what can you eat?
They'll fuck.
Can you eat anymore?

24
00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.220
Um,
I dunno.
I just try to eat.
I try to switch it up.

25
00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:28.500
I try to hope one carcinogen,

26
00:01:28.501 --> 00:01:31.620
knocks out the other carcinogen that's in my food and then I just do the

27
00:01:31.621 --> 00:01:35.580
elliptical.
That has been my game plan.
Um,

28
00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.150
I went down to the cellar last night,
Saturday night,
Saturday.

29
00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:44.870
I did one spot at the original than I did the fat black pussy cat upstairs.

30
00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.630
And then downstairs I did the village underground and um,

31
00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.280
I came walking in right.

32
00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.210
And I'd already eaten healthy and I came walking in in the seller has really

33
00:01:57.211 --> 00:02:00.670
healthy food.
The Olive Tree upstairs.
So Mike,
okay.
Worst case scenario,

34
00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.500
get like a chicken Kebab.
A little to hear.
Um,
what do you call that?

35
00:02:04.501 --> 00:02:09.000
That super chopped up the fucking salad.
Not Tahini.
That's the sauce.

36
00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.980
Uh,
not Tiki.
Marcella,
I don't what the fuck you call it.
I forget what it is.

37
00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:15.533
Um,

38
00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.860
I was going to get one of those salads and then I walked in lemonade,

39
00:02:19.861 --> 00:02:24.861
ordered out for Joe's pizza and they had four delicious large cheese or

40
00:02:25.711 --> 00:02:30.630
Pepperoni fucking pizzas and uh,
they're like,
have a slice of a slice.

41
00:02:30.631 --> 00:02:34.800
I'm like,
I can't,
I have an acting gig.

42
00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:36.540
It sucked.

43
00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.510
That's what kills me is I'm gonna have to try to cram all my pizza eating,

44
00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.750
you know,
I went off the rails and the Bruins lost,

45
00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:44.303
<v 0>uh,</v>

46
00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.550
<v 1>the Stanley Cup game seven,
but even then I only have one slice,</v>

47
00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.940
but they had all this great stuff and I laid off,
I laid off,

48
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.470
I stayed with the waters and I proceeded to have three of the most fun fucking

49
00:02:56.471 --> 00:02:58.320
shows I've had in a long time.
And I'll tell you,

50
00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:02.710
is all the great I get to do in this business.
I swear to God,
nothing.
Nothing.

51
00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:07.950
Nothing is more fun than doing stand up comedy and trying a new bit and having

52
00:03:09.701 --> 00:03:10.121
it work.

53
00:03:10.121 --> 00:03:14.980
There is nothing in this fucking business of shoe is they say that is more

54
00:03:14.981 --> 00:03:18.820
fucking satisfying and exciting than that.

55
00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:23.850
And um,
I finally got the abortion thing to work.

56
00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.390
I stopped opening with it so I just got it.
I moved it down a little bit.

57
00:03:27.391 --> 00:03:32.391
So they just saw I was sort of silly and then I went into it and um,

58
00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.200
I just had three fucking great shows the night before I was at the west side

59
00:03:38.201 --> 00:03:41.990
comedy club had a great set there and um,

60
00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.710
cause I'm going to be in Pittsburgh here in a few weeks and I got to come with

61
00:03:44.711 --> 00:03:49.590
all the new shit even though,
uh,
my special hasn't come out yet.
I feel like our,

62
00:03:49.591 --> 00:03:54.010
I did Pittsburgh on this run and I don't want to a,
I don't know,

63
00:03:54.011 --> 00:03:57.730
just in case somebody is a repeat customer,
you know what I mean?

64
00:03:57.731 --> 00:04:01.630
I don't want to come back with the same shit is what the fuck I'm saying.
So,

65
00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:03.550
and being out here in New York,

66
00:04:03.551 --> 00:04:07.990
it's really making me want to come out here every summer for a couple of weeks

67
00:04:07.991 --> 00:04:11.020
and just do a bunch of spots.
Um,

68
00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:16.100
take my wife to a bunch of cool stuff.
So at some point I gotta walk my Kiddo.
I,

69
00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:17.080
whenever I go to New York,

70
00:04:17.081 --> 00:04:18.910
I always have to do the walk across the Brooklyn Bridge,

71
00:04:18.911 --> 00:04:22.540
so I still have to do that.
And,
uh,
there's a couple other things,

72
00:04:22.541 --> 00:04:24.640
but I'm laying off the smokes now.
Um,

73
00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.870
I got four days laying off that I'm going to try and go back to how I used to
be,

74
00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:33.100
which is I smoked one every two weeks and I was beyond looking forward to it.

75
00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:34.713
Um,

76
00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.830
<v 3>yeah,</v>

77
00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.740
<v 1>it's just with father's day and my birthday people bought me a couple of boxes</v>

78
00:04:38.741 --> 00:04:40.810
of cigars and I'm Kinda like,
well,
what am I supposed to do here?

79
00:04:40.811 --> 00:04:43.390
I don't want these to go bad.
Right.
I mean,

80
00:04:43.391 --> 00:04:47.440
I got a smoke them probably hand a few off to my friends is what the fuck I

81
00:04:47.441 --> 00:04:48.820
should be doing.
But,
um,

82
00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.370
I don't know if there's always something you gotta be working on in your life.

83
00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.470
And it made my life is like fucking perfect right now.

84
00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:57.070
I've got a great acting gig.
I'm in New York.
I can do my stand up.

85
00:04:57.071 --> 00:05:00.730
My family's here,
I'm playing drums.
The weather has been nice.

86
00:05:00.731 --> 00:05:04.390
It hasn't gotten ridiculously hot yet.
It's just been absolutely fucking perfect.

87
00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:08.020
And today I'm going to do my podcast early and I'm going to hang around and I'll

88
00:05:08.021 --> 00:05:09.580
watch the rest of the u s open.

89
00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:13.810
I watched a little bit yesterday watching Rory and all these guys and fucking

90
00:05:13.811 --> 00:05:17.080
tiger and Phil Mickelson and all the younger kids who I don't even know who the

91
00:05:17.081 --> 00:05:19.840
hell they are.
I just got in,
I was just like,
you know what?

92
00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:24.280
It's so hard when the NHL and the NBA stopped those fast paced things,

93
00:05:24.281 --> 00:05:25.750
then all of a sudden just like,
you know,

94
00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:29.620
pull the emergency brake and try to get into baseball.
You know?

95
00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:31.601
But so I go,

96
00:05:31.601 --> 00:05:35.830
I'm going to go even further into a slowed down sport and I'm going to fuck it.

97
00:05:35.831 --> 00:05:39.220
I'm going to watch golf.
Cause then baseball was,
seemed fast paced.

98
00:05:39.221 --> 00:05:42.760
So that's what I did yesterday.
I,
I laid on the couch,
I watched it.

99
00:05:42.761 --> 00:05:46.750
I took an old man nap,
I think I fell asleep on that guy was trying to,

100
00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:50.710
[inaudible] was in the rough and there was a little fucking flower and there was

101
00:05:50.711 --> 00:05:55.360
a bee on it and he didn't want to swing the club and kill the bee,
you know,

102
00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:58.280
which back in the day they would have just blasted right through it.

103
00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:01.220
And you wouldn't have known because there was no HDTV.

104
00:06:01.221 --> 00:06:03.920
I don't think Peter had the fucking strength that they have now,

105
00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:07.640
but you know the bs of going away.
So I think that guy,
you know,

106
00:06:07.641 --> 00:06:10.670
he did was stinking environmentally.
You know,

107
00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:14.660
granted he swung the club and killed the fucking flower.
Um,

108
00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:16.360
what's going to happen that day?
Uh,

109
00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:20.480
vegetarians realize that plants feel pain.

110
00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:22.760
Then what are they going to eat

111
00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:30.050
if all of a sudden we come up with something that we can actually read their

112
00:06:30.051 --> 00:06:35.050
thoughts?
Like that flower was just sitting there yelling at the be,

113
00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:37.140
don't leave me dog Joe Lake Bay.

114
00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:38.870
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

115
00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:43.550
<v 1>Like that guy.
God,
Jack Dog,
Giotto this in 48 hours.
Tell him to be,</v>

116
00:06:43.551 --> 00:06:47.810
not to leave,
don't hand them the gun over.
Um,

117
00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:49.460
which by the way,

118
00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:54.770
in all of cinema had to have been the worst cop moment ever.

119
00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:58.220
When he gives his fucking gun away,
there's,

120
00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:01.760
I don't know anything about police being a policeman,

121
00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:06.350
but there's no fucking way you turn your gun over when he has a gun on a hostage

122
00:07:06.351 --> 00:07:10.340
and the zone,
a cop there without a fucking gun.
Uh,

123
00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:15.410
but anyway,
uh,
so the,

124
00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:19.210
the fucking flowers probably sitting there yelling at the bait,
all Amy dog,

125
00:07:19.211 --> 00:07:23.880
Giotto,
it,
and he takes off and he's just sitting there wanting to run in a cat.

126
00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:26.040
This guy just swings the club back,

127
00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:28.830
all the other flowers trying to look the other way.
Like,
yeah,

128
00:07:28.831 --> 00:07:33.750
you hate to say it day to fucking see it,
but you know something,

129
00:07:33.751 --> 00:07:35.700
a lot of nature is getting eaten alive.

130
00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:40.740
There's a lot of fucking horrible ways to go.
You just get eaten.
You know,

131
00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:44.790
I remember thinking,
get eaten by a lion would be terrible.

132
00:07:44.791 --> 00:07:48.540
And now when I watch it,
it's not that bad.
You know,

133
00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:51.500
I've seen a few people getting eaten by tigers and shit.
They just put,

134
00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:54.780
once they grab you around the neck,
which is immediately you just pass out,

135
00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:59.490
you know,
just like in the UFC,
except it's like the fucking tiger level strength.

136
00:08:00.090 --> 00:08:00.990
It's fucking over a law.

137
00:08:00.991 --> 00:08:05.400
That was one guy who was sort of kicking at another tiger.
This pathetic.

138
00:08:05.401 --> 00:08:10.380
He tried to sneak into the fucking zoo.
How much is the zoo?
You know,

139
00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:11.670
30,
40 bucks.

140
00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:16.290
And where he scaled and jumped over the wall was the fucking tiger.

141
00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:18.310
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

142
00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:21.700
<v 1>Layer enclave.
Uh,</v>

143
00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:26.800
what the fuck did they call those?
A condo.
Fucking areas.
Right.

144
00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:31.330
And he fucking landed.
Hit the fucking didn't look first,

145
00:08:31.331 --> 00:08:34.450
did not look before he leaves because he was doing something illegal.

146
00:08:34.451 --> 00:08:36.430
And he landed and he was in the fucking,

147
00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:43.080
he was in the fucking tiger and closure.
And uh,

148
00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:45.060
they don't have any guns over there.

149
00:08:45.390 --> 00:08:49.170
I'm sure they brought that up at one of those fucking second amendment.

150
00:08:49.171 --> 00:08:50.760
Is that one of this?
Is that the second amendment?

151
00:08:50.761 --> 00:08:54.920
The right to bear arms that you're on now out there was America to shot that

152
00:08:54.930 --> 00:08:59.930
fucking dog around the FYS cause that's what everybody with a gun sounds like.

153
00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:03.960
I'm kidding.
Of course they could have used a gun.

154
00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:05.430
That would have been a great time to have a gun,

155
00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:08.830
although the world is over populated and that guy was a fucking moron.

156
00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:11.580
Any was doing something bad.
So that's a very hard thing.
That's,

157
00:09:11.581 --> 00:09:14.790
that'd be a hard thing for gun owners,
you know,
cause they'd be like,

158
00:09:14.791 --> 00:09:19.710
that sound bitch got what he deserved.
All right.
Family values.
You go to the zoo,

159
00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:23.490
you paid to get in,
you don't sneak over.
And if you're going to sneak over,

160
00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:27.900
always make sure you have a whole weapon on you.
I learned that from Ted Nugent.

161
00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:29.700
All right?

162
00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:31.590
<v 3>Okay.</v>

163
00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:34.500
<v 1>Then on top of that,
the guy that happened to wasn't flat.</v>

164
00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:37.470
So I don't have any feelings for him whatsoever.

165
00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:41.440
They're taking enough stereotypes in there about gun owners.
Um,

166
00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:44.340
I always like people try to make them out like they're all a bunch of fucking

167
00:09:44.341 --> 00:09:46.530
morons.
You know,
it's like,

168
00:09:46.531 --> 00:09:49.350
well then wouldn't they be like fucking accidentally shooting themselves all the

169
00:09:49.351 --> 00:09:53.010
fucking time?
And don't even say they do.
Okay.
They don't,

170
00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:56.280
that's just like the helicopters and I fly where everybody says they're fucking

171
00:09:56.281 --> 00:09:59.520
dangerous because a bunch of people dying it.
Most people don't.

172
00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:02.790
Most people don't.
All right.

173
00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:06.630
And the people that do do dumb shit and uh,
you know,
that's it.

174
00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:09.990
So fuck it works.
If you do dumb shit,

175
00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:15.120
you're going to have a fucking problem.
Um,
all right.
Um,

176
00:10:15.121 --> 00:10:17.220
so you don't want to doing is,
I'm just,
I'm filibustering,

177
00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:20.820
I'm waiting for my fucking me to get some of the,
uh,

178
00:10:20.821 --> 00:10:24.220
the materials here that I need in order to complete my podcast.

179
00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:29.220
There's usually some sort of a advertising and of course you guys right in to

180
00:10:29.551 --> 00:10:33.630
the podcast.
I might have to hit pause here.
How much time have I done?

181
00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:39.510
How much time have I done?
Oh my God.
Only 10 minutes in.
Gee.

182
00:10:39.511 --> 00:10:41.490
Willikers Gee.

183
00:10:41.491 --> 00:10:45.570
Willikers I feel like I fucking talked about everything already.
I mean,

184
00:10:45.571 --> 00:10:50.130
God's sakes.
I have 50 more fucking minutes to go here.
Um,
oh,

185
00:10:50.131 --> 00:10:54.180
I took my a wife and kid to go see a movie yesterday.
Uh,
I went to go see the,

186
00:10:54.181 --> 00:10:57.450
what does that dog movie?
Patton.
Oswald Senate.

187
00:10:57.480 --> 00:11:01.230
Kevin Hart is in a Tiffany Haddish.
All these great comedians that are in it.

188
00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:06.830
Dog Movie
2019.

189
00:11:06.831 --> 00:11:11.360
What is it called?
Oh for God sakes,

190
00:11:11.810 --> 00:11:16.550
you advertisements only right outside my window.
All right.

191
00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:18.070
I should have wrote Kevin Hart in there.

192
00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:23.410
Kevin Hart,
dog movie

193
00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:30.370
secret lives of pet
part two.
Yeah,

194
00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:34.660
we went and got and saw that my daughter was so excited.
Right.
I was saying,

195
00:11:34.690 --> 00:11:37.060
I just telling her that I was going to go,
I go,

196
00:11:37.061 --> 00:11:41.920
I'm taking you to a movie tomorrow.
And she goes,
popcorn and a movie.

197
00:11:44.170 --> 00:11:45.730
It's your favorite thing in the world.

198
00:11:45.731 --> 00:11:48.190
She just sits there with this giant bag of popcorn.

199
00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:50.920
You gotta watch a toddler though.
Cause they're like a puppy.

200
00:11:50.921 --> 00:11:53.050
They'll eat until the,
literally they'd fucking belly.

201
00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:55.540
So I had to keep taking the bag away from her.

202
00:11:56.710 --> 00:11:57.543
<v 4>MMM.</v>

203
00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:00.370
<v 1>So she had like not,
not too much popcorn.</v>

204
00:12:00.371 --> 00:12:04.780
And then I gave her a couple of m and m's and that was it.
And,
uh,

205
00:12:04.810 --> 00:12:06.640
she sat there and she enjoyed the whole movie.

206
00:12:06.641 --> 00:12:09.310
So thanks to all the people that worked on that,
you know,

207
00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:11.620
being a little bit in the animated world,

208
00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:14.740
I can't imagine how much fucking work that is and how long it took you guys to

209
00:12:14.741 --> 00:12:17.830
do that.
So thank you for the great hour and a half,

210
00:12:17.890 --> 00:12:22.340
two hours of fucking entertainment.
And uh,
other than that,
all I did,

211
00:12:22.390 --> 00:12:26.170
I just walked around.
They didn't smoke any cigars.

212
00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:27.680
I was a,

213
00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:31.450
I was a good boy last night and I was rewarded with good fucking spites thank

214
00:12:31.451 --> 00:12:35.140
Christ.
So let's go,
let's go to the Google news.

215
00:12:35.141 --> 00:12:37.330
This is what I do while I wait for my,
um,

216
00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:40.600
when I went for my new shit to come in here,

217
00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:42.790
let's go to Google news.

218
00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:43.760
<v 4>Okay.</v>

219
00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:47.720
<v 1>As opposed to the mall where news that I was getting.
All right.</v>

220
00:12:48.170 --> 00:12:51.060
Donald Trump is up to his usual shit.
This is the funny thing ever.

221
00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:55.580
Trump warns of a market crash,
quote,
market crash,

222
00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.920
the likes of which has not been seen before.
If he loses the 2020 election.

223
00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:05.030
But economists are worried he's causing a recession of his own.

224
00:13:06.850 --> 00:13:11.120
He's causing it.
Don't the fucking assholes who really run it cause it.

225
00:13:11.130 --> 00:13:14.470
United States President Donald Trump on Saturday warned without evidence of a

226
00:13:14.471 --> 00:13:15.850
massive market crash.

227
00:13:17.270 --> 00:13:18.400
<v 4>If uh,</v>

228
00:13:19.010 --> 00:13:23.300
<v 1>warned without evidence of a massive market crash.
If he's not reelected in 2020.</v>

229
00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:23.841
Dude,

230
00:13:23.841 --> 00:13:28.841
have you ever seen a guy who loves to scream fire in a crowded movie theater?

231
00:13:29.541 --> 00:13:34.490
Like this guy,
the Trump economy is setting records and has a long way up to go.

232
00:13:34.491 --> 00:13:38.450
He said,
however,
if anyone but me takes over in 2020,

233
00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:41.780
um,
I know that I know the competition very well.

234
00:13:41.930 --> 00:13:45.920
There will be a market crash the likes of which has not been seen before.

235
00:13:45.950 --> 00:13:47.480
Keep America great.

236
00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:53.180
Do you realize how fucking selfish and irresponsible that is to tweet something

237
00:13:53.181 --> 00:13:54.014
like that?

238
00:13:55.470 --> 00:13:56.570
<v 4>MMM.</v>

239
00:13:57.620 --> 00:13:59.980
<v 1>Yeah.
I think that there's a market crash come in anyways.</v>

240
00:14:00.830 --> 00:14:03.770
I could say that without fucking known anything about at all.

241
00:14:03.771 --> 00:14:04.670
I know is they just,

242
00:14:04.671 --> 00:14:08.660
they just keep building these luxury high rise fucking apartment buildings

243
00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:10.220
everywhere I go,

244
00:14:10.310 --> 00:14:15.310
every fucking city I go to this just cranes and cranes and cranes building more

245
00:14:16.311 --> 00:14:20.300
shit.
I don't know where all of these people are going to go.
Now this,

246
00:14:20.301 --> 00:14:24.110
this conspiracy theory that the people that who really run the country are

247
00:14:24.111 --> 00:14:27.470
trying to drive everyone into the city.
Now,

248
00:14:27.471 --> 00:14:31.610
if they were building even remotely affordable housing,
I would believe that.

249
00:14:31.611 --> 00:14:35.360
But what these fucking luxury high rise fucking things are doing is they're

250
00:14:35.361 --> 00:14:38.120
actually forcing people out of the city.

251
00:14:39.210 --> 00:14:40.043
<v 4>MMM.</v>

252
00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:44.000
<v 1>I told,
I told you before about the,
I always love bringing this up.</v>

253
00:14:44.001 --> 00:14:47.300
Like some of these buildings that they're building in,
uh,
New York City,

254
00:14:47.301 --> 00:14:48.650
they are so high,

255
00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:54.040
they actually have to pay a shadow tax because they block the sun from certain

256
00:14:54.831 --> 00:14:59.831
parts of the park and the trees and the bushes and grass or resolve fucking

257
00:15:00.351 --> 00:15:02.750
dying.
Um,

258
00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:08.020
and then what kills me is they're actually up into the airspace commercial

259
00:15:08.301 --> 00:15:11.170
airspace,
Bravo airspace,
which for Laguardia,

260
00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:15.980
I dunno if it's Newark or what I think is Laguardia's airspace.
And,

261
00:15:16.070 --> 00:15:16.340
uh,

262
00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:20.480
it would just blow my mind that if you bought the penthouse and on a cloudy day

263
00:15:20.481 --> 00:15:24.680
when you can barely sit outside your window,
you were in the same airspace.

264
00:15:24.681 --> 00:15:26.750
Is Jumbo jets fucking flying by?
I mean,

265
00:15:26.751 --> 00:15:29.240
I just don't know how the fuck do you relax at that point?

266
00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:32.480
That's when you go downstairs to the lobby and,

267
00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:35.930
and asked what the Wifi is down there and you just wait for that marine layer to

268
00:15:35.931 --> 00:15:40.330
fucking burn off.
All right.

269
00:15:40.370 --> 00:15:43.850
What am I talking about?
Buildings in Bravo airspace at this point.
All right,

270
00:15:43.851 --> 00:15:44.750
this 15 minutes,

271
00:15:44.751 --> 00:15:48.450
I'm going to fucking just hit pause here and I'm going to wait until I get all

272
00:15:48.451 --> 00:15:53.270
of the materials I need and I will finish on with the podcast.

273
00:15:53.271 --> 00:15:54.104
All right?

274
00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:55.813
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

275
00:15:56.460 --> 00:15:59.800
<v 1>All right.
I'm back.
I got,
I got your questions.
I haven't gotten the reeds yet.</v>

276
00:15:59.801 --> 00:16:02.200
This is what happens when I fucking tried to do it so early,

277
00:16:02.710 --> 00:16:04.960
but I was just sort of going around here,

278
00:16:04.961 --> 00:16:07.840
did the Internet and um,

279
00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:11.480
this thing here was talking about a,

280
00:16:12.530 --> 00:16:17.510
I've led him Vladimir Putin.
Putin is Steven Seagal says,

281
00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:22.990
arrested critic Alexi Noveli last novel knee,

282
00:16:23.630 --> 00:16:27.200
hundreds more for taking part in an anticorruption protests.

283
00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:31.810
Russian authorities arrested Alexi,
President Vladimir's phrase,

284
00:16:31.811 --> 00:16:35.570
just critic along with hundreds of other protesters who took to the streets

285
00:16:35.930 --> 00:16:37.800
following the arrest of a journalist's.

286
00:16:37.801 --> 00:16:41.780
The mass arrests on Wednesday came after thousands of people participated in an

287
00:16:41.781 --> 00:16:46.010
unauthorized rally in support of freedom of the press and investigative

288
00:16:46.011 --> 00:16:48.200
journalism journalists,

289
00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:51.870
Ivan Golan of who was arrested on drug charges,

290
00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:53.690
on drug charges,

291
00:16:53.691 --> 00:16:56.330
but later released after the government and that there was no evidence he

292
00:16:56.331 --> 00:16:58.940
committed a crime.
Um,

293
00:17:01.250 --> 00:17:05.480
it's unbelief.
I,
you know,
how familiar does that look?
I mean,

294
00:17:05.481 --> 00:17:07.100
that's starting to be what it's like over here.

295
00:17:07.101 --> 00:17:10.790
I know it's a little more extreme,
but like you can't fucking protests.

296
00:17:10.791 --> 00:17:13.790
They let you,
you got to get a permit to protest and then when you do,

297
00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:15.080
they have you fucking,

298
00:17:15.410 --> 00:17:19.880
you're down like 20 blocks down and away from any sort of press coverage.

299
00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:25.120
All our presses fucking seems to be owned by fucking 10 different people.

300
00:17:25.730 --> 00:17:28.980
I Dunno,
I never understood the whole fucking end game of these cons.

301
00:17:28.981 --> 00:17:33.500
Who just want to run the world.
It's like,
and then what?
What are you going to do?

302
00:17:33.530 --> 00:17:35.810
What the fuck?
Why can't you just fucking just,

303
00:17:37.350 --> 00:17:40.400
is it that hard to not be an asshole?
This is coming from an asshole.

304
00:17:40.430 --> 00:17:44.420
I just don't fucking understand why you can't listen to your people.
I,
you know,

305
00:17:44.421 --> 00:17:45.920
I do get it on some level of,

306
00:17:45.921 --> 00:17:49.400
most people are mouth breathing morons and it's you,

307
00:17:49.401 --> 00:17:51.010
you got to kind of have a firm hand.

308
00:17:51.020 --> 00:17:55.620
I mean it was kid know where a bunch of children.
All right.
I can barely read.

309
00:17:55.621 --> 00:17:58.310
I get sleepy when I try to read in depth shit.

310
00:17:58.311 --> 00:18:00.300
So I mean I shouldn't be running anything.

311
00:18:00.301 --> 00:18:03.330
I'm glad that there are people out there doing it.
But I guess my,

312
00:18:03.450 --> 00:18:07.680
I guess my question is,
is that the only way to fucking do it

313
00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:13.440
is the only way to run a country is to have secrets and tell everybody to shut

314
00:18:13.441 --> 00:18:17.220
the fuck up and destroy anyone that questions your authority.

315
00:18:17.850 --> 00:18:22.470
Because regardless of the form of government,
capitalism,
communism,

316
00:18:22.890 --> 00:18:25.530
whatever,
I don't even know enough of them.
Show socialism.

317
00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:31.440
Um,
that seems to be what they all do.
They all do the exact same fucking thing.

318
00:18:31.530 --> 00:18:36.030
You know,
the illusion of choice,
the illusion of freedom,

319
00:18:36.270 --> 00:18:40.320
you know,
but I mean you are free sort of.
I don't know.

320
00:18:41.010 --> 00:18:44.850
I don't know how it works.
This has gotta be a Shit Day.

321
00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:47.340
You just said they got all these guys saying I'm a corrupt piece of shit.

322
00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:50.070
I got to go out and go fucking arrest this guy and then you know,

323
00:18:50.071 --> 00:18:52.420
people are going to be slapping them around and stuff and then when we were

324
00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:55.710
supposed to sit there reading and fucking pheasant or whatever the fuck rich

325
00:18:55.711 --> 00:18:59.910
people eat,
you know,
they always need some weird bird.
Can't have chicken.

326
00:18:59.911 --> 00:19:00.900
That's like too common.

327
00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:04.710
They always have to have like a fucking goose or some you just going to sit

328
00:19:04.711 --> 00:19:07.140
there and do that while these guys are fucking torture and somebody,

329
00:19:07.170 --> 00:19:09.870
cause they had the audacity to say that maybe you were a little outside the

330
00:19:09.871 --> 00:19:13.590
lines a few times.
You know,
I think that you could actually,

331
00:19:13.770 --> 00:19:14.940
if people thought you were corrupt,

332
00:19:14.941 --> 00:19:18.240
you could actually stay in power if we just admitted it to open like you know

333
00:19:18.241 --> 00:19:22.440
what?
Yeah,
I got a little out of line a couple of times,
but you know,

334
00:19:22.441 --> 00:19:26.610
if you look historically,
this is how it's done.
What say we changed that,

335
00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:29.340
so what are your top complaints about me?

336
00:19:29.341 --> 00:19:33.780
I will work on it and I'll free all these journalists and from here on out I

337
00:19:33.781 --> 00:19:37.410
will welcome their criticisms and I will try to be a better leader now at that

338
00:19:37.411 --> 00:19:40.380
point,
even the fucking people you jailed,

339
00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:44.580
well they probably don't trust you at that point I would think would be willing

340
00:19:44.581 --> 00:19:45.990
to give you a second chance.

341
00:19:45.990 --> 00:19:50.800
I just don't understand why every single fucking time you got to go is Patrice

342
00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:53.340
O'Neal used to say,
you've got to take out the fucking goat hand,

343
00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:57.810
put it on the back of people's necks and just start fucking kicking the shit out

344
00:19:57.811 --> 00:20:01.590
of everybody.
It's got to be it.
Is there a,
is there a country out there?

345
00:20:01.591 --> 00:20:05.880
I don't know.
I don't,
I didn't get that vibe when I was in Iceland.
You know,

346
00:20:05.881 --> 00:20:09.180
there are countries out there where I don't feel like they necessarily have to

347
00:20:09.181 --> 00:20:13.500
do that,
but uh,
who knows?
Who knows that it's a depressing,

348
00:20:13.501 --> 00:20:16.020
it's why don't fucking pay attention to it.
It's all,
it's above me.

349
00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:20.490
I don't understand why I,
I'll say it till the day.

350
00:20:20.491 --> 00:20:23.250
I just do not understand how war is still legal.

351
00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:26.460
I understand somebody literally comes in and fucking attacks you.
You got,

352
00:20:26.461 --> 00:20:29.730
you got to fight fire with fire,
but just as far as just like,
hey,

353
00:20:29.731 --> 00:20:31.680
we want to do this.
Well,
we're going to do that.

354
00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:35.880
All right now we're going to try to kill more of your people.

355
00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:40.860
Then you can kill of ours and whoever kills more people is right.

356
00:20:44.070 --> 00:20:48.670
That's the best we can do.
I have a wireless headphone set,

357
00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:52.220
but we can still go to war.
All right.

358
00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:55.000
Let me read some of the reads here for this weekend and these aren't the

359
00:20:55.001 --> 00:20:56.080
advertising.
This is,

360
00:20:56.081 --> 00:20:59.950
I'm going to go straight to the fucking emails here at my 19 year old daughter

361
00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:04.810
introduced me to you about three months ago.
My 19 year old daughter,

362
00:21:05.610 --> 00:21:08.800
uh,
introduced me to you and I am a big fan.

363
00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:13.690
What I love about you is that my daughter and I can enjoy your comedy together

364
00:21:13.990 --> 00:21:18.210
and I get to enjoy the references that bring back my childhood.
I'm 52.
Well,

365
00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:21.310
I'm 51.
There you go.
Look at this.

366
00:21:21.311 --> 00:21:25.090
Everybody thinks I don't have any sort of a female demographic.
Look at this.

367
00:21:25.091 --> 00:21:29.290
I got a 19 year old kid introducing me to where?
Mom.
Perfect.

368
00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:33.130
Uh,
and you explain the references to my daughter this week,

369
00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:37.690
Phil Negro and Ken Stabler.
If you're going to read a book,

370
00:21:37.691 --> 00:21:39.610
Go back and read Jack Tatum's.

371
00:21:39.611 --> 00:21:41.890
They call me a assassin and I've already read that.

372
00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:46.740
It will remind you just how brutal football was.
Yo.
Yeah,
the NFL was,
you know,

373
00:21:46.750 --> 00:21:51.460
I read that one.
I read 'em
bye.
They call.
Uh,

374
00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:56.370
was he on a Hollywood Henderson's book?
I read a lot of them.

375
00:21:56.371 --> 00:21:58.260
I read these desks.
The type of shit I read.

376
00:21:58.950 --> 00:22:02.760
I read the autobiography use of everyone who wrote one in guns and roses,

377
00:22:03.780 --> 00:22:06.900
um,
vesa kind of reading.
I do.

378
00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:10.050
And then every once in a while I'll actually do something that's actually,

379
00:22:10.110 --> 00:22:11.220
I'll read like a,

380
00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:12.620
<v 3>yeah,</v>

381
00:22:12.620 --> 00:22:17.450
<v 1>you know,
a difficult book that isn't a book about some famous person's life,</v>

382
00:22:17.451 --> 00:22:21.350
but that Ken Stabler one is definitely on my radar.

383
00:22:21.890 --> 00:22:26.810
In fact,
I enjoyed reading in between setups on the movie so much.

384
00:22:26.811 --> 00:22:31.520
You know what?
I might go to a fucking amazon.com right now.
See if I can,

385
00:22:31.521 --> 00:22:36.020
if I can fucking find that book,
I'm going to go.
I went to see Ken Stabler Book,

386
00:22:36.710 --> 00:22:41.330
Ken Stabler and I got a water now before you comes by every copy.
Ken Stabler

387
00:22:43.190 --> 00:22:47.600
auto by a Griffey are right.
There we go.
Come on.

388
00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:51.410
What do you got there?
Oh,
it's just called snake.

389
00:22:54.050 --> 00:22:55.730
Are you kidding me?
That's all it's called.

390
00:22:55.731 --> 00:23:00.230
Snake Badass is by John The legend of the snake.

391
00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:02.240
John Madden does the forward or sound,

$4 and 19 cents.

394
00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:13.830
Why is Amazon 1721 cause it is that the drone charge?

395
00:23:15.570 --> 00:23:18.990
Well,

400
00:23:27.181 --> 00:23:27.690

401
00:23:27.690 --> 00:23:32.310
The life and times of pro football's first bad boy fame is not the first bad

00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:51.110
Hey,

I mean,

406
00:23:51.111 --> 00:23:54.590

Look at these books.
All my God.

407
00:23:54.591 --> 00:23:56.510
I found my part of the library

00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:02.260
countdown to Superbowl.

409

How the 68 69 New York jets delivered on Joe name is promise.

410
00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:11.780
This is all you do is you just start clicking on these fucking things.

All these people like me saying,
I don't like to fucking read.
I will read.

423
00:25:03.721 --> 00:25:06.840
I always read all of those fucking books.

424
00:25:06.841 --> 00:25:10.050
At least the basketball ones was bill Simmons.

425
00:25:10.051 --> 00:25:13.470
When I read his book on the history of basketball,
Jesus Christ,

426
00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:18.750
that guy would be like,
it's like an ric.
Robbie's in Eric ferns stuns book.

427
00:25:18.751 --> 00:25:22.050

430
00:25:28.261 --> 00:25:31.830
It shows how men are dying in their prime at an increasing rate.

431
00:25:32.250 --> 00:25:33.840
92,000 a year,

432
00:25:34.140 --> 00:25:38.340
twice as many as the Korean and Vietnam wars combined,

433
00:25:38.730 --> 00:25:42.750
which is funny because almost three quarters of all health and lifestyle related

434
00:25:42.751 --> 00:25:47.751
progress products are marketed towards women proves many of your points.

435
00:25:48.601 --> 00:25:51.630
Happy Father's Day.
Um,

436
00:25:51.660 --> 00:25:56.160
well I think it's also marketed towards women because they're allowed to take

437
00:25:56.161 --> 00:25:58.650
care of themselves.
You know what I mean?

438
00:25:58.980 --> 00:26:02.340
Guys have like a fear of going to the doctor.

439
00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:06.120
And you know what that fear is is because you haven't gone in so long.

440
00:26:06.330 --> 00:26:09.000
So if you're a young guy,
I recommend bright.

441
00:26:09.001 --> 00:26:13.110
Now getting a doctor going and get a physical,
you know,

442
00:26:13.170 --> 00:26:16.920
99.9%,
you're going to be all right.
And you know,
if you're not,

443
00:26:17.070 --> 00:26:19.710
it's great you went in because then they can fucking maybe save you.

444
00:26:20.370 --> 00:26:24.450
But if you go in early,
it's like back in the day,
like the getting,

445
00:26:24.451 --> 00:26:26.430
getting tested for HIV aids,

446
00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:30.720
the first test was fucking brutal cause that was your entire career.

447
00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:34.650
Everything you fucking did and you just sat this sweating bullets.

448
00:26:34.651 --> 00:26:37.800
Then the next time they had to get tested like fucking once a year and then

449
00:26:37.801 --> 00:26:41.220
you're only worried about maybe one or two incidents,
you know,

450
00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:44.430
you'd always lie to yourself,
I'm always going to work.
I mean,
only fuck up.
Right.

451
00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:47.610
All right.
Uh,
so I highly recommend that.
All right.

452
00:26:47.611 --> 00:26:50.250
The real gender gap in heart disease

453
00:26:51.810 --> 00:26:52.621
because I'm a guy.

454
00:26:52.621 --> 00:26:57.330
I took a poll at the recent family barbecue heart disease who has it worse men

455
00:26:57.331 --> 00:26:59.430
or women?
I asked the answers came prickly.

456
00:26:59.431 --> 00:27:04.320
My mother in law and sister in law said women,
my father in law,
arms crossed,

457
00:27:04.321 --> 00:27:07.110
said confidently men,
um,

458
00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:11.220
my mother in law remembered hearing about how heart disease affected women more

459
00:27:11.430 --> 00:27:16.350
than men during the February American heart association go red for women.

460
00:27:17.730 --> 00:27:20.820
I gotta be honest with you.
When I hear people dropping a heart attacks,

461
00:27:20.821 --> 00:27:24.770
it's usually a guy.
Uh,
anyways,

462
00:27:24.780 --> 00:27:28.290
apparently the message wasn't heard by the men at this family gathering.

463
00:27:28.291 --> 00:27:31.890
They were moved by stories of men,
fathers,
brothers,
friends.

464
00:27:31.891 --> 00:27:33.900
They knew who died from heart disease.

465
00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:39.120
We are taught that facts should Trump feelings,
evidence should Trump anecdotes.

466
00:27:39.121 --> 00:27:44.121
And at first glance it would appear the men are in touch with their feelings.

467
00:27:45.510 --> 00:27:46.350
It is the mission.

468
00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:51.380
What is that mission of advocacy organizations like the a h a to raise awareness

469
00:27:52.441 --> 00:27:55.530
charts like this one are wildly,

470
00:27:57.270 --> 00:27:58.103
<v 3>yeah,</v>

471
00:27:58.280 --> 00:28:02.990
<v 1>discernment and used in countless presentations on the topic.</v>

472
00:28:02.991 --> 00:28:04.310
I don't even can't even read that word.

473
00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:07.460
Well I thought this is going to be an easy article.

474
00:28:07.461 --> 00:28:08.271
I don't know what they're talking about.

475
00:28:08.271 --> 00:28:10.370
The graph demonstrates that over the last few decades,

476
00:28:10.371 --> 00:28:13.970
the number of women dying from heart disease has been significantly higher than

477
00:28:13.971 --> 00:28:18.971
men from heart disease in the year 2000 alone.

478
00:28:18.981 --> 00:28:23.981
The gap is the most impressive with 70,000 more women dying than men.

479
00:28:24.980 --> 00:28:28.130
The problem with the chart is that it's completely misleading.

480
00:28:28.131 --> 00:28:32.570
Mortality in the case is best judged by death rates that take into account age

481
00:28:32.870 --> 00:28:35.480
and population at risk.
Dude,
I gotta be honest with you.

482
00:28:35.481 --> 00:28:40.340
I know a number of guys who've had heart attacks and who died of heart attacks.

483
00:28:40.341 --> 00:28:42.290
I don't know.
I've never known a woman to die of a heart attack.

484
00:28:42.850 --> 00:28:43.683
<v 3>Okay.</v>

485
00:28:45.090 --> 00:28:46.560
<v 1>I Dunno.
That's weird.</v>

486
00:28:48.790 --> 00:28:51.670
I feel like women get breast cancer and guys get heart attacks.

487
00:28:51.671 --> 00:28:54.010
That's Kinda how it,
then we get fucking prostate cancer.

488
00:28:55.840 --> 00:28:57.240
MMM.

489
00:29:00.220 --> 00:29:01.750
That seems like they,
they actually,

490
00:29:01.870 --> 00:29:05.050
what I was that person trying to just say the opposite and the email,

491
00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:08.410
cause it seemed like they would argue on the other side.
I have no idea.

492
00:29:08.411 --> 00:29:10.900
All I know is I have a doctrine now when I get fucking checked out,

493
00:29:10.930 --> 00:29:14.500
that's what I do.
Cause I had a buddy of mine who is 49 years old,

494
00:29:14.501 --> 00:29:18.730
getting on an elliptical was in better shape than me and had a fatal heart

495
00:29:18.731 --> 00:29:21.340
attack.
So,
um,

496
00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:23.830
and he was never overweight or anything like that.

497
00:29:23.831 --> 00:29:25.960
So sometimes it's just like you're a

498
00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:27.833
<v 3>okay,</v>

499
00:29:27.970 --> 00:29:31.120
<v 1>you know,
your genetics and then also like the shit that's in food.</v>

500
00:29:31.121 --> 00:29:35.320
Who the fuck knows who the fuck knows?
Sometimes my paranoia,

501
00:29:35.321 --> 00:29:39.310
I think that they let you know,
it's usually just because of money.

502
00:29:39.370 --> 00:29:40.690
But I and I,

503
00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:44.560
but I like the politicians let what happened to our food supply happen because

504
00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:48.220
they knew that they couldn't tell people to just stop having as many kids so we

505
00:29:48.221 --> 00:29:49.980
can taper off the population itself.

506
00:29:49.990 --> 00:29:53.580
Maybe they're taking things into their own hands.
I have no idea.
All right.

507
00:29:53.620 --> 00:29:54.460
Apple store.

508
00:29:55.420 --> 00:30:00.420
I bet they have a beautiful fucking organic garden for everybody at a certain

509
00:30:01.421 --> 00:30:05.920
level of power being old school shit.
All right.

510
00:30:05.921 --> 00:30:09.100
Apple Story.
Hey.
Oh,
William Billboard.
Uh,

511
00:30:09.101 --> 00:30:12.550
you may want to think twice about taking your apple products apple store.
Well,

512
00:30:12.551 --> 00:30:15.910
too late now.
I recently saw this video.
I thought you might find it interesting.

513
00:30:15.911 --> 00:30:19.210
Just something to consider.
Uh,

514
00:30:19.420 --> 00:30:21.850
apple genius bar is scamming customers.
What?

515
00:30:21.851 --> 00:30:24.340
They didn't charge me any money and they fixed it.

516
00:30:25.630 --> 00:30:26.463
<v 4>MMM.</v>

517
00:30:27.340 --> 00:30:31.110
<v 1>Now I got to watch a 12 minute.
Oh,</v>

518
00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:33.580
they're talking about their labor charges.
Well,

519
00:30:33.581 --> 00:30:36.250
I'm glad somebody put this out here because they were on their best behavior.

520
00:30:36.251 --> 00:30:39.160
When I went there,
I showed up and they said,
William,
we have you down.

521
00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:43.510
We will call you in six minutes.
And I sat and I listened to music and write.

522
00:30:43.511 --> 00:30:47.350
When I was worried did they forget about me to people came over.

523
00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:50.570
What's the problem?
They figured it out.

524
00:30:51.940 --> 00:30:54.970
They fucking handle this shit in 20 minutes it was over.

525
00:30:55.450 --> 00:30:59.590
I'm never clicking on anything ever again in the mall where it was gone.

526
00:31:00.310 --> 00:31:03.490
It was really bothering me that that was on my fucking,
to the point.

527
00:31:03.491 --> 00:31:07.990
I didn't even use my laptop for like three days.
I was so fucking pissed.

528
00:31:08.650 --> 00:31:10.570
It's like I don't watch porn anymore.

529
00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:12.673
<v 4>MMM.</v>

530
00:31:13.350 --> 00:31:16.410
<v 1>I don't booze anymore.
I've totally cleaned up my fucking life trying to,</v>

531
00:31:16.411 --> 00:31:20.420
you know,
be a better person here and within.
Yeah.

532
00:31:20.430 --> 00:31:23.040
I still end up getting a fucking,
if I was watching porn and be like,
well,

533
00:31:23.041 --> 00:31:24.240
you know,
I played the game,
you know,

534
00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:32.190
what are you going to do?
I mean,
you know,
you're going to get into a knife fight.

535
00:31:32.191 --> 00:31:34.320
You're going to get fucking cut.
What do you think's going to happen?

536
00:31:34.590 --> 00:31:38.820
But I was sitting there being a goddamn saint and I still got one.
Very,

537
00:31:38.821 --> 00:31:43.290
very upsetting.
Um,
all right,
let's read another one here.
What do we got here?

538
00:31:44.310 --> 00:31:47.850
Okay.
Single girl helped love when the ladies right in.
All right.

539
00:31:47.910 --> 00:31:49.960
Hello Billy matchmaker.

540
00:31:51.780 --> 00:31:55.890
I'm a longtime female listener in need of advice.
If you are Nia,

541
00:31:55.960 --> 00:32:00.210
have a few minutes to help out.
I'm a 35 year old woman living in New York City.

542
00:32:01.020 --> 00:32:04.470
I own a two family townhouse in Brooklyn.
Ah,
you're crushing it.

543
00:32:04.471 --> 00:32:08.580
She goes on and I'm a land.
I'm a land lady.
That's awesome.

544
00:32:09.930 --> 00:32:13.410
Good for you.
That thing.
We'll pay you your whole life.
Um,

545
00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:17.400
I have a curvy and voluptuous yet healthy size 12 figure.

546
00:32:17.550 --> 00:32:20.220
I don't know what that means.
I know you're curvy.
You're a bigger girl.

547
00:32:20.970 --> 00:32:24.360
I hit my home gym on the regular and go to therapy once a week.

548
00:32:24.540 --> 00:32:28.200
I got great relationships with supporting and loving friends and family.

549
00:32:28.470 --> 00:32:30.750
I absolutely love music and cook pretty well.

550
00:32:30.900 --> 00:32:34.410
I run my own small business that is successful and as you can tell,

551
00:32:34.411 --> 00:32:38.070
I have a great sense of humor.
Been listening to your podcast since 2011.

552
00:32:38.150 --> 00:32:40.520
All right.
What's not like?
Uh,

553
00:32:40.521 --> 00:32:43.550
I've done a lot of work on myself over the years to break habits of dating guys

554
00:32:43.551 --> 00:32:44.870
who are fun in real life,

555
00:32:44.871 --> 00:32:49.160
but on paper have Peter Pan Syndrome and are essentially adult children.

556
00:32:49.190 --> 00:32:53.390
I'm ready for the real thing.
There you go.
I was that guy for a long time.

557
00:32:53.750 --> 00:32:56.720
The problem is I'm having a hard time finding the real thing.

558
00:32:57.140 --> 00:32:58.760
I work in the fashion industry.

559
00:32:58.761 --> 00:33:02.540
The majority of my colleagues are straight women or gay guys.

560
00:33:02.900 --> 00:33:07.900
Any men after that are married or 23 years old,

561
00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:12.200
23 year old interns.
I've asked my,
uh,
friends,

562
00:33:12.220 --> 00:33:16.160
men and women in successful relationships,
if they could play matchmaker for me,

563
00:33:16.340 --> 00:33:17.660
but none of them trust the guy,

564
00:33:17.690 --> 00:33:22.430
their guy friends enough to get with me and not to not screw me over.

565
00:33:22.530 --> 00:33:27.380
Yeah.
It's hard anyways because I'm focused on a healthier lifestyle.

566
00:33:27.530 --> 00:33:30.520
I'm not interested in meeting uh,

567
00:33:30.530 --> 00:33:34.610
a guy at a bar at 2:00 AM now you're doing all the right things.
You're right.

568
00:33:34.611 --> 00:33:37.910
Guy is coming,
you stay in single,
you're working on yourself.

569
00:33:39.170 --> 00:33:39.740
Um,

570
00:33:39.740 --> 00:33:43.820
I would suggest before you get through the rest of this is getting some sort of

571
00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:48.770
extra curricular activity then involves interacting with healthy people.

572
00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:51.370
<v 4>MMM.</v>

573
00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:53.680
<v 1>Some sort of sports league thing.</v>

574
00:33:54.650 --> 00:33:55.490
<v 4>Uh,</v>

575
00:33:55.560 --> 00:33:59.280
<v 1>maybe some sort of volunteer work just somewhere where you're going to hopefully</v>

576
00:33:59.281 --> 00:34:00.270
meet decent people.

577
00:34:00.271 --> 00:34:03.420
Just get into that circle cause you're not going to meet a decent guy at 2:00 AM

578
00:34:03.421 --> 00:34:07.560
in a bar.
Uh,
anyways,
I'm not in Aa or 12 steps.

579
00:34:07.620 --> 00:34:10.740
I just like to wake up early and not have a bloated face.

580
00:34:11.820 --> 00:34:15.900
A online dating is okay,
but most people on here just looking for hookups.

581
00:34:15.930 --> 00:34:18.510
Absolutely.
I'm not approved by any means.

582
00:34:18.570 --> 00:34:23.400
I've had more than my fair share of action living in the dorm room that is NYC.

583
00:34:23.580 --> 00:34:24.570
So the question is,

584
00:34:24.571 --> 00:34:28.770
can you suggest ways for in New York City for me to meet guys who have their

585
00:34:28.771 --> 00:34:31.260
shit together,
who are looking for the real thing?

586
00:34:31.261 --> 00:34:35.940
Perhaps if one of your listeners hears this and is interested.
No,

587
00:34:35.941 --> 00:34:37.110
absolutely.
Well,

588
00:34:37.111 --> 00:34:41.250
I think I gave you the suggestions that I have a 51 year old man who is not been

589
00:34:41.251 --> 00:34:45.920
single in,
I dunno,
15 years.
So,

590
00:34:46.010 --> 00:34:46.843
um,

591
00:34:48.870 --> 00:34:52.740
I do know that when you decide like I am not settling and I'm just going to stay

592
00:34:52.741 --> 00:34:56.010
single until the right person comes along.
Uh,

593
00:34:56.160 --> 00:34:59.760
that's when most people meet the person that they're supposed to be with.

594
00:35:00.150 --> 00:35:04.170
You don't force it,
you don't force it.
And you know,

595
00:35:04.230 --> 00:35:08.880
you go through the holidays alone,
which is fine,

596
00:35:09.900 --> 00:35:12.760
you know,
hang out with other single people and there's light,
there's a friend,

597
00:35:12.780 --> 00:35:16.830
then you can also be,
you know,
other parts of your life.
Uh,

598
00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:19.650
do well like your business because you're not distracted by,

599
00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:22.630
I thought we weren't going out and I,
you know,

600
00:35:22.631 --> 00:35:24.820
and that's what it sounds like when you're with the wrong person.

601
00:35:25.930 --> 00:35:26.350
<v 4>Okay.</v>

602
00:35:26.350 --> 00:35:28.030
<v 1>When you with the right person,
like,
Hey,</v>

603
00:35:28.031 --> 00:35:30.370
I thought we were going out tonight and be like,
Oh fuck yeah,
let's do it.

604
00:35:31.690 --> 00:35:34.960
I actually like you.
Uh,
well good luck,
good luck.

605
00:35:34.961 --> 00:35:37.620
You're doing all the right things.
You're still young.
You still your prime,

606
00:35:37.621 --> 00:35:41.490
you got the whole fucking thing ahead of you.
You're crushing it.
Um,
I,
yeah,

607
00:35:41.491 --> 00:35:44.120
I would try to,
you know,

608
00:35:45.180 --> 00:35:47.690
look at Time Out New York and shit like that.
There's a,

609
00:35:47.710 --> 00:35:51.450
there's things that like decent people do and I don't know what they are.

610
00:35:51.451 --> 00:35:54.120
Cause I'm one of these filthy entertainers.
I'm in the,

611
00:35:54.121 --> 00:35:56.670
I'm in the nightclub scene.
You don't want to be around this sweetie.
Okay.

612
00:35:57.270 --> 00:36:00.210
I'll tell you it's a rough one.
Um,
there's gotta be something,

613
00:36:00.211 --> 00:36:04.930
something going on in the park,
you know,
those people back in the day who like,

614
00:36:04.931 --> 00:36:07.690
let's,
let's start a roller blading group.
Like those people there,

615
00:36:07.700 --> 00:36:12.700
those are decent people.
Um,
I dunno,
I just realized,

616
00:36:12.701 --> 00:36:16.840
I don't know where the decent people are.
Uh,
accidentally cut someone.

617
00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:20.440
I love how this word is coming into the lexicon.

618
00:36:20.730 --> 00:36:24.700
Cocked is like a big fucking internet word.
Everybody loves using that word now.

619
00:36:25.180 --> 00:36:26.890
Uh,
hey Billy Budd fucker.

620
00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:33.100
The more soft mark,
the funnier.
Uh,
hey bill.

621
00:36:33.101 --> 00:36:37.360
I just found out about a situation I become involved in and would like to hear

622
00:36:37.361 --> 00:36:38.830
your opinion on the matter.

623
00:36:39.150 --> 00:36:43.690
I'm a 20 year old college student in Pittsburgh and find myself involved with

624
00:36:43.691 --> 00:36:47.470
the lady during the school year.
We weren't dating or anything,

625
00:36:47.471 --> 00:36:49.960
but she would read regularly,
come over and we would hook up.

626
00:36:50.260 --> 00:36:53.080
The girl is really hot and the sex was good and all,

627
00:36:53.290 --> 00:36:57.840
but eventually I broke things off and started seeing a different girl.
Oh,

628
00:36:57.841 --> 00:36:59.860
I'm seeing a different girl.
Okay.
Every now and again,

629
00:37:00.070 --> 00:37:01.720
this girl would hit me up to hang up,

630
00:37:01.721 --> 00:37:04.360
but we never did because I was interested in another girl.

631
00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:07.510
And even though I'm no longer seeing the new girl,
this,

632
00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:12.430
this other girl is still hits me up from time to time.
Uh,
however,

633
00:37:12.670 --> 00:37:16.700
I recently found out that this broad had a boyfriend in the entire time.

634
00:37:17.230 --> 00:37:20.320
Oh,
the entire time we were fucking Jesus Christ.

635
00:37:21.310 --> 00:37:24.040
I know someone who got the shit kicked out of him one time because of that.

636
00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:25.210
They had no idea,

637
00:37:26.470 --> 00:37:31.470
had no idea and was sitting in the car with her and this guy just fucking yanked

638
00:37:31.661 --> 00:37:35.230
him out and beat the shit out of him.
Of course,
it's his fault.
Right.
Uh,

639
00:37:35.231 --> 00:37:38.780
I kind of feel like a piece of shit knowing I was fucking someone else's girl.

640
00:37:38.781 --> 00:37:38.921
Yeah.

641
00:37:38.921 --> 00:37:43.921
But you didn't know because I wouldn't willingly hookup are even hit on a girl

642
00:37:44.170 --> 00:37:46.360
who was in a relationship.
Uh,

643
00:37:46.361 --> 00:37:49.930
I would just like your opinion on whether I should feel bad about having sex

644
00:37:49.931 --> 00:37:51.820
with the girl,
this girl dozens of time.

645
00:37:52.120 --> 00:37:55.920
And you think I should reach out to the guy to let them know how much of a whore

646
00:37:55.921 --> 00:37:57.850
or his girlfriend is a,

647
00:37:57.851 --> 00:38:02.530
I would love to hear what the lovely Nia feels about this as well.

648
00:38:03.010 --> 00:38:05.900
Thanks.
And Go fuck yourself.
Um,

649
00:38:07.980 --> 00:38:10.440
well there's no reason for you to feel guilty because you didn't know you were

650
00:38:10.441 --> 00:38:11.640
doing anything wrong.

651
00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:14.380
<v 4>Uh,</v>

652
00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:18.270
<v 1>reach out to the guy that that's your decision.</v>

653
00:38:20.180 --> 00:38:22.550
I would,
I personally would just walk.

654
00:38:23.120 --> 00:38:25.910
I never tried to get involved in shit like that.
Cause

655
00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:29.770
you know what,
if the person doesn't believe you,

656
00:38:29.771 --> 00:38:32.380
then they know who the fuck you are and then you're dealing with some fucking

657
00:38:32.381 --> 00:38:36.430
crazy shit.
I Dunno,
I have no,
uh,

658
00:38:36.431 --> 00:38:38.050
I'll let you make that decision yourself,

659
00:38:38.051 --> 00:38:39.790
but you shouldn't feel guilty because you didn't know.

660
00:38:39.820 --> 00:38:43.870
If you go back and do it again,
then you should feel guilty.
Um,

661
00:38:45.150 --> 00:38:49.400
all right.
That was an easy one.
Okay.
What else we got here?
I don't even miss it.

662
00:38:49.401 --> 00:38:53.460
Might done.
Ah,
Jesus,
another 22.
Okay.
Uh,

663
00:38:53.500 --> 00:38:58.420
my wife and I have been together for 13 years,
10 years,

664
00:38:58.421 --> 00:39:03.220
married and almost 11,
uh,
10 years.
Married almost 11.

665
00:39:03.221 --> 00:39:06.600
All right.
Whenever we argue,
oh,
this is wife

666
00:39:08.710 --> 00:39:12.310
wife's things,
wife's things.
My body is aggressive.

667
00:39:13.540 --> 00:39:18.220
What wife thinks my body is aggressive.
I don't even know what.
Anyways,

668
00:39:18.221 --> 00:39:20.350
hello couplets.
Bill.

669
00:39:21.700 --> 00:39:23.980
My wife and I have been together for 13 years,
10 years,

670
00:39:23.981 --> 00:39:28.420
married almost 11 whenever we argue,
she accuses me of yelling,
which I'm not.

671
00:39:28.660 --> 00:39:32.170
I sometimes proceed to show her the difference between the way I'm talking and

672
00:39:32.171 --> 00:39:33.004
yelling.

673
00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:38.290
She then chain changes to say that I'm not yelling,

674
00:39:38.291 --> 00:39:42.970
but I'm sounding aggressive.
I don't know what that means,

675
00:39:42.971 --> 00:39:47.470
and I've asked her what does she mean?
She's talking about your tone.
She says,

676
00:39:47.471 --> 00:39:50.140
because I have a deep voice and a big guy,

677
00:39:50.141 --> 00:39:53.710
six three to 60 that I come across as aggressive.

678
00:39:53.950 --> 00:39:58.390
This pisses me off because I cannot control my size.
To me,

679
00:39:58.391 --> 00:40:01.120
she's saying if I was a smaller guy with the same voice,

680
00:40:01.121 --> 00:40:02.620
I would not sound aggressive.

681
00:40:02.890 --> 00:40:07.450
I've gone so far as to argue my point with the gay voice to sound like

682
00:40:07.810 --> 00:40:11.740
aggressive.
This that's you did that.
He goes,

683
00:40:11.741 --> 00:40:13.660
just pisses her off even more.

684
00:40:14.290 --> 00:40:17.440
I've walked away so I don't get pulled into any arguments.

685
00:40:17.441 --> 00:40:20.710
This pisses her off even more.
I don't know what to do.

686
00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:23.260
How do I control something I have no control of?

687
00:40:23.380 --> 00:40:27.070
I feel like she just wants someone to argue with and I'm forced to take the
bait.

688
00:40:27.071 --> 00:40:29.470
That's what I feel.
She just wants to argue.

689
00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:33.970
Then I made to feel guilty for my size and voice by being labeled aggressive.

690
00:40:34.210 --> 00:40:39.130
How do I a not make my large football players size body not seem aggressive

691
00:40:39.131 --> 00:40:43.030
during an argument and be walk away from the argument without pissing her off

692
00:40:43.060 --> 00:40:46.650
even more.
Thanks and go fuck yourself,
uh,

693
00:40:46.660 --> 00:40:50.860
while dreaming of the 2010,
2011 cup run.
Oh,

694
00:40:50.861 --> 00:40:55.180
that's what you meant by couplets.
Um,

695
00:40:56.650 --> 00:41:01.180
uh,
yeah,
dude,
this is what's going on.

696
00:41:01.181 --> 00:41:05.080
She is manipulating the living shit out of you to win arguments.
All right?

697
00:41:05.081 --> 00:41:07.750
So what you have to do in an argument is you have to not raise your voice.

698
00:41:07.751 --> 00:41:09.520
This is what the,
if you want to win with the woman,

699
00:41:10.150 --> 00:41:13.660
you have to not raise your voice.
You have to,
you have to say what,

700
00:41:13.780 --> 00:41:18.550
what they did and how it made you feel,
and then you have to listen to them.

701
00:41:18.970 --> 00:41:21.820
And when they're done yapping,
okay.

702
00:41:21.821 --> 00:41:24.550
If they tried to warm their way out of it and you know,

703
00:41:24.551 --> 00:41:26.980
they're trying to worm their way out of it.
You can't accuse him of it.

704
00:41:26.981 --> 00:41:30.280
You have to sit there and say like,
okay,
I heard what you say.

705
00:41:30.281 --> 00:41:33.350
I don't understand how that pertains to what it is.
And I'm saying,

706
00:41:34.420 --> 00:41:34.650
<v 3>yeah,</v>

707
00:41:34.650 --> 00:41:38.490
<v 1>and you just stay there.
And eventually if you with a fucking adult,</v>

708
00:41:38.550 --> 00:41:43.470
they're going to apologize.
All right?
You shouldn't be yelling anyways.

709
00:41:43.471 --> 00:41:46.200
I'm trying to stop doing it.
I bet it was doing so great.

710
00:41:46.201 --> 00:41:50.670
And I dunno the stress of being on the road and I can't go to therapy now.

711
00:41:50.671 --> 00:41:54.810
I have,
I've kind of fucking,
I've gone back a little bit,

712
00:41:54.811 --> 00:41:59.811
but I was able to see that and now I'm kind of focusing back on not yelling,

713
00:41:59.850 --> 00:42:04.140
but,
um,
I think,
uh,

714
00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:09.150
the fact that you have the balls to have done the gay voice to your wife,

715
00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:14.310
um,
shows me that you're not afraid of her and she doesn't have your balls in the

716
00:42:14.311 --> 00:42:16.620
purse.
So I would just,
you know,

717
00:42:18.870 --> 00:42:21.720
I would talk to her about this while you're not in an argument,

718
00:42:23.310 --> 00:42:27.820
I would just sit her down and say,
we need to talk.
She'd be like a cat.

719
00:42:28.190 --> 00:42:30.580
All right?
And then you sit down and just say,
listen,

720
00:42:31.480 --> 00:42:34.510
when you're in an arg and in a relationship,
you're going to have disagreements.

721
00:42:35.080 --> 00:42:39.520
Okay.
The way I air my disagreements doesn't seem to be working for you.

722
00:42:39.521 --> 00:42:42.670
So I need you to tell me the proper way that I,
I,
you know,

723
00:42:42.671 --> 00:42:46.660
so then you get her to commit.
If I sit down and not raise my voice,

724
00:42:46.661 --> 00:42:50.380
will I then be heard and not be criticized?
Right?
So then,

725
00:42:50.470 --> 00:42:54.550
and then just play by her fucking rules and she'll think that she's winning.

726
00:42:54.700 --> 00:42:59.320
But then what she's done is she's eliminated her ability to avoid what it is

727
00:42:59.321 --> 00:43:02.320
that you're saying.
And just talk about,
you know,
the way you're,
you,

728
00:43:02.350 --> 00:43:06.790
you gestured with your arm,
how low your voice or high your voice was.

729
00:43:06.820 --> 00:43:08.830
And that takes all of that off the table.

730
00:43:08.980 --> 00:43:13.540
And now you just have to deal with the point that you're trying to make.
And a,

731
00:43:13.541 --> 00:43:17.280
I would give that a try and um,

732
00:43:17.830 --> 00:43:18.880
hopefully that works.

733
00:43:18.940 --> 00:43:23.110
And if it doesn't and she still just finds a million things to bitch about,

734
00:43:23.530 --> 00:43:25.570
then I would consider moving on.

735
00:43:27.230 --> 00:43:28.640
Because you know,

736
00:43:28.670 --> 00:43:33.080
who wants to be in a relationship with someone who's not an adult and you're

737
00:43:33.081 --> 00:43:38.030
just signing up to be bitched at 24 fucking seven for the rest of your fucking

738
00:43:38.031 --> 00:43:41.690
life.
And honestly,
who the fuck wants that?
Nobody wants that.

739
00:43:42.380 --> 00:43:44.530
Okay.
And uh,
if you,

740
00:43:44.531 --> 00:43:47.990
if you sit down with her and you have this conversation and then the next time

741
00:43:47.991 --> 00:43:48.860
you guys argue,

742
00:43:49.070 --> 00:43:53.150
if you followed by what she's saying would not be aggressive and all of that,

743
00:43:53.300 --> 00:43:54.920
and she still has a problem with it,

744
00:43:54.921 --> 00:43:59.030
then you advance the conversation saying like,
listen,
this is not adult behavior.

745
00:43:59.900 --> 00:44:04.460
Okay,
I'm not signing up.
I don't want to,
if this is the way you're going to be,

746
00:44:05.780 --> 00:44:08.930
every time we have a disagreement that no matter what I'm doing,

747
00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:10.790
it's not going to be about what I'm saying.

748
00:44:10.791 --> 00:44:13.950
It's going to be about the way that I presented it.
Um,

749
00:44:14.180 --> 00:44:16.940
then I'm never going to be heard in this relationship and that's not what I'm

750
00:44:16.941 --> 00:44:20.370
looking for.
So what do you want to do?

751
00:44:21.180 --> 00:44:23.610
Say thanks is saying that back up with me.

752
00:44:23.960 --> 00:44:26.700
I'm saying if you don't start acting like an adult,

753
00:44:27.090 --> 00:44:31.650
I am going to break up with you.
I'm going to move on.
This is going get old.

754
00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:36.990
Okay.
I know I'm not right 100% of the time,
but I know a good 30%,

755
00:44:36.991 --> 00:44:39.540
35 on a good month.
I am right.

756
00:44:39.870 --> 00:44:43.380
And I'm just not seeing the data's not showing that the,
the,
the results here.

757
00:44:44.370 --> 00:44:46.230
All right.
I would go that route.

758
00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:47.330
<v 3>Okay.</v>

759
00:44:47.330 --> 00:44:51.320
<v 1>I would go that route.
All right,
that's it.
Uh,
for the questions.</v>

760
00:44:51.321 --> 00:44:54.350
Now I'm waiting for the advertising method link like three of these fucking

761
00:44:54.351 --> 00:44:55.184
things together.

762
00:44:58.810 --> 00:44:59.643
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

763
00:44:59.990 --> 00:45:03.860
<v 1>Ah,
right now I'm back.
I'm back waiting time for the reeds here.
Good Lord.</v>

This has been a real disjointed podcasts.
I apologize.
Simply stay safe.
Everybody.

765
00:45:08.750 --> 00:45:12.050
You know,
10 years ago getting home security stunk.

766
00:45:12.440 --> 00:45:16.880
It felt like companies went out of their way to make your life miserable with

767
00:45:16.881 --> 00:45:21.860
long contracts.

768
00:45:21.890 --> 00:45:25.070
you rewire your whole home.
Well,
I must've sucked.

769

That was painless with the reeds over there.

807
00:47:51.110 --> 00:47:54.920
Um,
so this has been the battle.

808
00:47:54.921 --> 00:47:58.280
The battle has been not to fight the battle of the bulge here.
I have to eat.

809
00:47:58.281 --> 00:48:00.860
Well,
I think we wrap on August 9th.

810
00:48:01.970 --> 00:48:06.890
So I'm going to go hit the fucking elliptical again.
And um,

811
00:48:06.950 --> 00:48:10.130
I got to remember my knee pad.
I'm at that age now.

812
00:48:10.850 --> 00:48:14.930
I got precise or whatever in my fucking left knee and my,
and my left shoulder.

813
00:48:14.990 --> 00:48:16.640
My right shoulder finally feels good.

814
00:48:16.641 --> 00:48:19.230
That was the one that was always the problem with the fucking rotator,

815
00:48:19.300 --> 00:48:22.610
where we're tated cuff there,
whatever the hell you call it now.
My right,

816
00:48:22.611 --> 00:48:27.320
one's all fucked up so I don't know what to do.
I remember thinking like,
ah,

817
00:48:27.321 --> 00:48:30.680
you know,
getting old.
It's just like,
it's like a mentality.

818
00:48:31.010 --> 00:48:34.040
And I just stayed active and I was still thinking like I'm still running up

819
00:48:34.041 --> 00:48:36.140
flights of stairs.
I'm almost 50 years old.

820
00:48:36.141 --> 00:48:39.380
And then just one day fucking got the old right there,

821
00:48:39.381 --> 00:48:42.390
Fred three out of four of my major joints.

822
00:48:42.390 --> 00:48:46.110
So now it's becoming all,
what the hell I'm eating?

823
00:48:47.250 --> 00:48:48.061
I don't know.
It's the worst.

824
00:48:48.061 --> 00:48:51.750
I was reading that Howard stern thing as I was saying that,
that um,

825
00:48:53.580 --> 00:48:57.090
the uh,
article in rolling stone,
it was this wide combination of it was like,

826
00:48:57.990 --> 00:48:58.470
you know,

827
00:48:58.470 --> 00:49:03.470
inspiring to see somebody that's trying to like change and become a new person,

828
00:49:03.540 --> 00:49:05.670
a better version of who they used to be or whatever.

829
00:49:06.270 --> 00:49:11.070
And then it was also depressing with just talking about people getting old and

830
00:49:11.071 --> 00:49:14.700
people fucking dying and all of that shit.
Just,
uh,

831
00:49:15.960 --> 00:49:18.490
you know,
I got it.
Well,
how do you guys want to go?

832
00:49:18.491 --> 00:49:22.400
What you gotta you gotta pick the fucking dying in your sleep as the way to go.

833
00:49:23.130 --> 00:49:24.770
You ran your nineties you know,

834
00:49:24.930 --> 00:49:27.980
you had a little cup of cocoa and a cookie or something like that right before

835
00:49:27.981 --> 00:49:28.814
you went to bed.

836
00:49:29.090 --> 00:49:32.540
And you just fucking let you get people when they get really old,
super old,

837
00:49:32.541 --> 00:49:37.090
they're ready to die.
You know,
my grandmother was like that.

838
00:49:37.091 --> 00:49:40.930
She lived to almost be 105 years old and she outlived she was,

839
00:49:41.710 --> 00:49:46.300
she went through three sets of friends.
Can you imagine that?

840
00:49:46.301 --> 00:49:49.210
Just think everybody,
you know and love is dead.

841
00:49:50.630 --> 00:49:53.900
And then you get another group of people that you know and love and then they

842
00:49:53.901 --> 00:49:58.340
die and then you get the third set and they start dying.
And as you'd get to,

843
00:49:58.341 --> 00:50:00.020
at some point you gotta be sitting there going like,
all right,

844
00:50:00.021 --> 00:50:04.060
am I a vampire this whole fucking time?
And I didn't realize it.

845
00:50:05.790 --> 00:50:10.790
How many people usually start dropping 60s and 70s so you live 30 years beyond

846
00:50:11.611 --> 00:50:16.350
that,
you know you're going to have to rebuild the franchise.
A couple of times.

847
00:50:19.920 --> 00:50:22.950
Here's another thing too.
When you die,
young people care.

848
00:50:23.730 --> 00:50:28.280
People show up,
you get a great funeral.
The older you get,

849
00:50:28.610 --> 00:50:30.320
the less people that knew you,

850
00:50:31.650 --> 00:50:32.483
<v 3>they're gone.</v>

851
00:50:33.860 --> 00:50:37.970
<v 1>I'm trying to think,
the optimal age to die.
Like at what point?
Like,</v>

852
00:50:38.210 --> 00:50:39.650
like if they were graphing

853
00:50:41.570 --> 00:50:44.520
like a great funeral as far as people giving a shit,

854
00:50:44.540 --> 00:50:47.360
because you want people to be devastated when you die.
Right?

855
00:50:47.810 --> 00:50:50.210
You don't want people to just speak.
They're going through the motions.

856
00:50:50.211 --> 00:50:52.280
You want people to be emotionally affected,

857
00:50:52.580 --> 00:50:56.120
but as you out live everybody or you live long enough that all your friends are

858
00:50:56.121 --> 00:50:58.580
old.
That even when they go up there,

859
00:50:58.581 --> 00:51:00.680
they have a lifetime of memories that is going to be up there.

860
00:51:00.681 --> 00:51:05.060
Like where like good fella and fall asleep,

861
00:51:05.061 --> 00:51:06.980
like fucking that dude on the Simpsons.

862
00:51:07.830 --> 00:51:08.663
<v 3>MMM.</v>

863
00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:13.250
<v 1>I would say sometime in a,</v>

864
00:51:15.100 --> 00:51:16.870
once you get over 70

865
00:51:18.820 --> 00:51:23.560
once you get over 70 I think that that's,
you lived too low,

866
00:51:23.590 --> 00:51:27.340
too long for a good funeral,
you know what I mean?

867
00:51:27.341 --> 00:51:29.440
As far as people really caring,
you know,

868
00:51:29.441 --> 00:51:33.550
that's when you start getting to wow our,
was he 75 that's a nice run,
man.

869
00:51:33.670 --> 00:51:36.880
I take 75 can't pitch at that.
You know,
people start saying shit like that,

870
00:51:37.540 --> 00:51:41.680
you know,
anything younger than even the 60s now people are like,
oh so young,

871
00:51:41.681 --> 00:51:45.790
60 you know,
67 is dead.
It's just not a long time.

872
00:51:45.791 --> 00:51:49.680
Like people need to see that seven.
Once you get in the seven and eights,

873
00:51:49.720 --> 00:51:54.150
forget about it.
Like no one gives a shit,
you know,
nineties you know,

874
00:51:55.760 --> 00:51:56.593
<v 3>I dunno.</v>

875
00:51:58.700 --> 00:51:59.660
<v 1>I'm trying to think like,
hey,</v>

876
00:51:59.670 --> 00:52:03.230
I every time somebody dies in their nineties oh his grandmother died.
Really?

877
00:52:03.470 --> 00:52:07.430
Yeah,
she was 91 [inaudible] 91 can't get too upset.
I mean,

878
00:52:07.431 --> 00:52:10.010
I know it's just grand five grand mother.
You can't get too upset about that.

879
00:52:10.011 --> 00:52:13.370
Right.
I wonder if that's what the doctors say to you.

880
00:52:13.371 --> 00:52:15.770
If you make it into your nineties and you went to the hospital and you're on

881
00:52:15.771 --> 00:52:19.280
your deathbed and they were like,
all right,
listen,
this is it.
But uh,
you know,

882
00:52:19.281 --> 00:52:22.550
you can't get too mad at that.
I mean 91 you lived in every decade.

883
00:52:23.960 --> 00:52:28.550
Just think of all this shit that you saw.
You know I'm in Christ.

884
00:52:28.551 --> 00:52:29.420
When you were a little member,

885
00:52:29.440 --> 00:52:32.750
the member or your friend who got hit with the rock from the slingshot fucking

886
00:52:32.751 --> 00:52:36.380
debt,
there's been like 12 presidents since that happened.

887
00:52:36.410 --> 00:52:38.270
I don't know what the fuck you're complaining about.

888
00:52:38.270 --> 00:52:42.380
Like nobody has any sympathy for you.
It's like when Bob hope died,

889
00:52:43.860 --> 00:52:48.270
if Bob hope died like 40 years before he did,

890
00:52:48.271 --> 00:52:51.510
if he died in his sixties like it would've been,
it would've borderline Ben.

891
00:52:51.511 --> 00:52:52.920
Like when,
when Reagan died,

892
00:52:53.170 --> 00:52:55.740
when they parade in his body all over the fucking country.
Right.

893
00:52:56.730 --> 00:52:59.430
I mean as far as what a giant that guy was,

894
00:52:59.431 --> 00:53:03.990
but he lived so fucking long.
There was nobody left.

895
00:53:05.740 --> 00:53:08.410
You know,
I'm trying to think of great funerals.
Elvis had a great one.

896
00:53:09.990 --> 00:53:12.090
All those white caddies.
Reagan had a great one.

897
00:53:13.660 --> 00:53:15.430
Reagan had a better one than Elvis.

898
00:53:15.760 --> 00:53:19.150
I'm trying to think of the best funerals as far as like,
okay,

899
00:53:19.151 --> 00:53:21.670
if I'm going to die and I want everybody to give a shit.

900
00:53:21.910 --> 00:53:26.450
As far as people giving a shit.
Oh it does.
It does.
There's one for you,
right?

901
00:53:26.670 --> 00:53:30.960
Top your top five public figure funerals of all time.

902
00:53:32.640 --> 00:53:35.880
I got Elvis,
Ronald Reagan.

903
00:53:38.590 --> 00:53:42.450
You see
those are the two that come to mind.

904
00:53:45.470 --> 00:53:49.710
Oh I got to,
I can't pick a top five.
It's gotta be an athlete or something.
Right

905
00:53:51.210 --> 00:53:52.630
singer or a politician.

906
00:53:57.160 --> 00:53:59.590
You'd think Michael Jackson's would have been bigger.
Michael Jackson.

907
00:53:59.591 --> 00:54:01.210
Cause you know what,
by then,
by the time he died,

908
00:54:01.510 --> 00:54:05.290
there was like the online response,
you know what I mean?

909
00:54:05.291 --> 00:54:07.510
All these people made like these dance videos.

910
00:54:08.020 --> 00:54:09.370
So that was amazing because that came,

911
00:54:09.371 --> 00:54:11.860
that was like around the fucking world's reaction.

912
00:54:12.220 --> 00:54:16.780
So in a way his was the biggest,
but like I didn't see like a lot of,

913
00:54:17.200 --> 00:54:19.660
maybe it wasn't like televised.
I don't,
I don't fucking know.

914
00:54:20.890 --> 00:54:25.870
This is a nice morbid subject to try to end the podcast on.
Um,

915
00:54:26.320 --> 00:54:28.000
all right,
well I think I've done a bottle now.

916
00:54:28.020 --> 00:54:31.240
This podcast might be a little bit short,
but it is father's day today.
And,
uh,

917
00:54:31.241 --> 00:54:36.010
I got to hang out with the wife and Kiddo and I got some lines to learn from my

918
00:54:36.011 --> 00:54:38.800
scene tomorrow.
Look at this.
We're already halfway through June.

919
00:54:38.800 --> 00:54:43.630
The shoot is going to fly by June is flying by and make sure you get out there.

920
00:54:43.631 --> 00:54:47.920
You enjoy this summer.
Okay.
Make sure you put on your sunblock.
By the way.

921
00:54:47.921 --> 00:54:52.600
My head's peeling and had to do this scene outside in the backyard for the

922
00:54:52.601 --> 00:54:55.630
entire fucking day.
And they were giving me this umbrella to stand underneath.

923
00:54:55.631 --> 00:54:58.810
And it wasn't until the end of the day that I was kinda thinking like,
well,

924
00:54:58.811 --> 00:55:02.740
this umbrella was designed to stop rain,
not block out the fucking Sun.

925
00:55:03.610 --> 00:55:06.100
And,
uh,
I cooked my head.

926
00:55:07.450 --> 00:55:10.420
I didn't overcook it all right.
But it was definitely done.

927
00:55:10.450 --> 00:55:14.440
The little Purdue of and stuff and roaster,
that thing popped and it was done.

928
00:55:15.550 --> 00:55:16.500
And,
uh,

929
00:55:17.200 --> 00:55:21.550
my head hurt for like three days and now it's just like,

930
00:55:21.610 --> 00:55:26.220
that's gross.
It's like fucking peelings fucking disgusting.
So that's what,

931
00:55:26.230 --> 00:55:29.020
that was my big father's day wish.
What do you want for fall is father's day.

932
00:55:29.021 --> 00:55:30.010
I'm like Aloe Vera.

933
00:55:32.950 --> 00:55:35.010
So I will be staying out of the sun.
Uh,

934
00:55:35.050 --> 00:55:39.100
thank you to the west side comedy club and the comedy cellar forgetting me up.

935
00:55:39.190 --> 00:55:43.840
Uh,
this weekend I had such a fucking great time and I'm loving standup more than

936
00:55:43.841 --> 00:55:47.890
ever and I'm,
I'm actually really enjoying the crowds here in New York.

937
00:55:47.920 --> 00:55:52.450
I think I cracked the code and figure out how to tease them in a way that gets

938
00:55:52.451 --> 00:55:55.120
them out of that stupid,
you know,
post me too.

939
00:55:55.121 --> 00:56:00.121
Hashtag I need to take everything super seriously at this comedy show.

940
00:56:00.221 --> 00:56:03.880
And also to remind them too that they didn't hire a comic for a private show

941
00:56:04.660 --> 00:56:08.590
that they're adults and they went out to a nightclub.
Okay.
Okay.

942
00:56:08.680 --> 00:56:10.510
It's a fucking relax.
All right,
that's it.

943
00:56:11.800 --> 00:56:15.310
I don't know who to cheer on at this point.
Hockey's done.
Football's done.

944
00:56:15.970 --> 00:56:19.630
Basketball's done.
Go Red Sox.
Kinda the middle of the pack.

945
00:56:19.990 --> 00:56:23.230
Little over 500 Yankees are crushing it and they know you have their regulars.

946
00:56:23.950 --> 00:56:27.880
I know they just uh,
got a big time free agent.
They always do shit.
Right.

947
00:56:28.420 --> 00:56:31.630
And so I'm going to be watched your baseball this year to see if the Yankees can

948
00:56:31.631 --> 00:56:35.710
win it this year.
And they'll have gone,

949
00:56:37.100 --> 00:56:37.933
<v 0>you know,</v>

950
00:56:38.180 --> 00:56:42.470
<v 1>they'll have one,
one in this decade,
keeping this streak alive since the 80s.</v>

951
00:56:42.650 --> 00:56:47.060
They want twenties,
30s,
forties,
50s,
60,
76 decades in a row.

952
00:56:47.090 --> 00:56:50.960
Six decades in a row.
They went over in the eighties.
Now they got the nineties,

953
00:56:52.080 --> 00:56:53.040
<v 0>uh,</v>

954
00:56:53.530 --> 00:56:57.610
<v 1>2000.
And then if they get the teens,
there'll be halfway to their record again.</v>

955
00:56:57.640 --> 00:57:01.330
It's fucking amazing.
And look at the Lakers stocking up.

956
00:57:01.331 --> 00:57:03.700
Like you knew they would get an Anthony Davis.

957
00:57:04.660 --> 00:57:08.470
We'll see how that works out out there.
Um,

958
00:57:08.890 --> 00:57:12.430
I guess we were possibly in the running,
but like,
I don't know,
we just,

959
00:57:12.670 --> 00:57:17.470
we don't play the free agency game to,
well we don't do it as well as the Lakers.

960
00:57:17.471 --> 00:57:20.260
Do you know,
we did it well with the big three.

961
00:57:20.261 --> 00:57:23.110
That's the one and only time I feel like we really got it fucking right.

962
00:57:23.830 --> 00:57:27.490
But then,
um,
I dunno,

963
00:57:27.910 --> 00:57:31.450
the Kyrie Irving thing didn't work out.
I mean he played well for us.

964
00:57:31.690 --> 00:57:34.210
We won games and shit.
But like at the end of the day,

965
00:57:34.211 --> 00:57:37.420
it's all about winning a championship with us.
Hang on.

966
00:57:37.450 --> 00:57:41.910
I've got to let people know.
Hey,
how are you?

967
00:57:42.460 --> 00:57:47.350
What's up guys?
I'm still recording.
How is dance class?
Was it fun?
Yeah.

968
00:57:47.770 --> 00:57:52.690
What'd you do?
Oh,

969
00:57:52.691 --> 00:57:56.930
look at that.
Good for you.
Can you say happy father's Day.
Dot.

970
00:57:58.780 --> 00:58:00.010
Yeah.
Thank you very much.
All right,

971
00:58:00.011 --> 00:58:03.160
let me wrap this up and we're going to hang it in.
There you go.

972
00:58:04.870 --> 00:58:09.760
There you go.
Alright.
That's the,
uh,
that's the podcast here for this week.
Uh,

973
00:58:09.761 --> 00:58:14.410
so yeah,
so I think,
um,
I don't know how many more years do you think Lebron has?

974
00:58:14.440 --> 00:58:17.030
It's weird.
You always seems tired,
but I dunno.

975
00:58:17.110 --> 00:58:19.810
Then it comes to the playoffs and he fucking go.
If he gets there,
you know,

976
00:58:19.811 --> 00:58:22.150
it's the first time he hasn't made it obviously in like fucking,

977
00:58:22.870 --> 00:58:26.620
I don't know how many years,
but uh,
I think he's got plenty left in the tank.

978
00:58:26.621 --> 00:58:29.320
So I'd say the Lakers are looking pretty good,
even though they had a trade away.

979
00:58:29.321 --> 00:58:33.670
All of their team.
I want to see,
uh,
you know,

980
00:58:33.970 --> 00:58:36.280
I'll be interesting to see what's going to happen.

981
00:58:36.520 --> 00:58:39.190
What about the fucking warriors?
Jesus Christ,
man,

982
00:58:40.150 --> 00:58:44.620
they lose Katie and then they,
I keep wanting to call him fucking clay Matthews,

983
00:58:44.621 --> 00:58:45.454
Klay Thompson,

984
00:58:46.440 --> 00:58:51.440
just fucking too devastating injuries and they might be out for the entire

985
00:58:52.930 --> 00:58:55.420
fucking year.
It's unreal.
It's unreal.

986
00:58:55.421 --> 00:58:59.040
And then the Lakers fucking load up and just like that they're right back in it,

987
00:58:59.260 --> 00:59:04.090
you know,
it's fucking unreal.
Kills me.
Kills me as a Celtics Fan.

988
00:59:04.120 --> 00:59:06.250
But I gotta admit it sucks when their bed,

989
00:59:06.790 --> 00:59:10.120
cause Celtics Lakers is the best shit you're going to watch.
All right.
That's it.

990
00:59:10.420 --> 00:59:13.750
That's the podcast.
Go fuck yourselves.
And I'll check in on you on Wednesday.

991
00:59:13.870 --> 00:59:14.650
Thursday.
Sorry.
