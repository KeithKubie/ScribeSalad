00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
We saw with our thought experiment in space that our two astronauts with no gravity

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
or any forces acting on them couldn't distinguish between motion and rest.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Now we're ready to learn Newton's First Law of Motion.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Remember our space example.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
We saw our two astronauts  with no forces acting on them,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
because there was no gravity in our empty universe.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
They couldn't distinguish between motion in a straight line at constant speed

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and being at rest.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
On the train we saw that there was absolutely no experiment that we could do

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
which could distinguish between being at rest and traveling at a constant speed.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Newton took these kind of thoughts and formulated his first law,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
which states that every object will always continue in its state of rest

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
or constant velocity motion, unless it's acted on by an external force.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Now, you may be saying to yourself, "What about an apple on the ground?"

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Surely, that's an object at rest, but it's gravity pulling down on it?

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Well, the answer to both of your questions is, yes, it is at rest,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
and, yes, gravity still is pulling down.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
This is a very interesting question and one that we're going to cover a little bit later in the unit.

00:01:00.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Stay tuned to find out what's going on here.
