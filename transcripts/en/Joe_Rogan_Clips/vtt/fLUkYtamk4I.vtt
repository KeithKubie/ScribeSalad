1
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.810
Yeah,
I've seen,
you know,
there's a,
there's a guy online that has,

2
00:00:03.811 --> 00:00:08.550
I'm on Instagram gt 500 super swap.
He took uh,

3
00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.030
an old,
uh,

4
00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.080
gt 500 body and put it on a gt 500 from a modern chassis and piece it together

5
00:00:16.321 --> 00:00:19.480
like that.
But I was always thinking with a,
with a setup like that,

6
00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:22.560
you probably can't have air bags,
right?
You can,

7
00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.270
here's actually ways to add it into there,
but you get into the air.
It is,
yeah.

8
00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.470
You get into the geometry and the direction of the airbag,

9
00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.580
so beautiful that it looks so,
yeah.

10
00:00:32.581 --> 00:00:37.050
But you don't want to play with the R and d of trying to put an airbag in the,

11
00:00:37.051 --> 00:00:39.480
something like that unless you really,

12
00:00:39.481 --> 00:00:42.360
really know what you're doing because you don't,
you know,

13
00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:44.060
refraction of an inch off of,

14
00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:47.160
of being where it needs to be that airbag could do more damage than good.

15
00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.750
It's weird though because you're dealing with a totally different size body too.

16
00:00:51.751 --> 00:00:56.310
So I wonder how he's doing this.
It's easy as,

17
00:00:56.311 --> 00:00:59.550
it doesn't sound easy,
but it is,
is it really?
Have you done that before?

18
00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.470
We haven't,
but I,
I understand the process and really it's just cut massage,

19
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.100
move in,
move out.
You know,
because there's a company called Mag Motors.

20
00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:09.720
You ever heard of them?
I don't think I have.

21
00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:13.170
Go to a MAG motors.com they have a,

22
00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.290
what they're doing is they're putting a carbon fiber body on a modern gt 500 but

23
00:01:19.411 --> 00:01:22.380
they're using a 67 like Eleanor body,

24
00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.370
but they're making it out of carbon fiber.
So it's a,
that one's gross.

25
00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:31.100
Go to the silver one.
That white one looks best to hate the Eleanor bodies,

26
00:01:31.101 --> 00:01:34.350
so you really know overplayed.
How dare you.
It's just too,

27
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.430
it's just been done so many times,
but who cares?
It's amazing.
Yeah,
go.
Yeah,

28
00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:40.470
that's,
those are the images,

29
00:01:40.471 --> 00:01:43.350
but go to get it from the side so you get a better look at it.

30
00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.470
That's fucking beautiful car.
See,
to me it sits weird.

31
00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.340
It looks like it sits a little too high and it looks like they're worried,

32
00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.610
like I don't know anything about them.
But to me looking at it,

33
00:01:53.611 --> 00:01:57.120
it's like you need to get it down a little bit and get a little more attitude to

34
00:01:57.121 --> 00:01:59.760
get a deeper dish on the wheel.
Um,

35
00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.900
well I think what they're doing is trying to use all the geometry yes.

36
00:02:03.901 --> 00:02:06.330
Of the modern car.
Correct.
So you end up with something,

37
00:02:06.331 --> 00:02:11.100
it looks like it could go four wheeling
a little bit.

38
00:02:11.101 --> 00:02:14.520
Right?
Yeah,
it's not,
it's definitely not slammed.

39
00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.350
Yeah.
In terms of looks right.
Yes.
I mean,

40
00:02:19.351 --> 00:02:21.810
I'm sure the car runs and drives and performed unbelievably,

41
00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.980
but it's missing a little to me it's missing little something.
Um,

42
00:02:25.981 --> 00:02:30.120
you know that company classic recreation's [inaudible] have you seen them?
No,

43
00:02:30.121 --> 00:02:32.940
I don't think so.
They do.
They're doing similar cars like that too,

44
00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.190
but they're doing it,
you know,
from the ground up.

45
00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:37.090
There's a lot of people doing it.
Um,

46
00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.580
because it's with technology coming the way that it has,
it's,

47
00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:45.660
it's not as hard and to do as it used to be.
Um,
it's still tea labors tasks,

48
00:02:45.661 --> 00:02:49.680
don't get me wrong,
but you know,
you can make all those systems work in anything.

49
00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.050
I see a guy like you that's a car guy.

50
00:02:52.051 --> 00:02:54.930
You look at an Eleanor and you look at it like it's played,

51
00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.220
but a person who doesn't see them all the time.
It was not in a industry.
You,

52
00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.190
when was the last time you saw one of those fucking things on the street?
Shit,

53
00:03:03.191 --> 00:03:05.650
I ain't never said Jackson.
There was like five of them for sale.

54
00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.380
That's the thing.
If you go there,
but like fusion motor sports,

55
00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.880
there are down the street here they make,
they're the only licensed dealers.

56
00:03:12.881 --> 00:03:16.300
They have some deal with the,
the woman who was the,

57
00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:21.170
she was the wife of the guy who wrote gone in 60 seconds or producing or

58
00:03:21.171 --> 00:03:25.720
something like that.
And so they make a c go to fusion.

59
00:03:25.721 --> 00:03:27.520
Eleanor.
They make some pretty sick ones.

60
00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:31.540
But you think there's a played out personally?
Yeah.

61
00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:35.410
I'm just not an in our car fan.
That is fucking beautiful.

62
00:03:35.411 --> 00:03:38.470
Why do you hate America,
Richard?
I don't hate America.
How could you,

63
00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.300
how could you not love that?
It's just,

64
00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:44.410
there's hundreds if not thousands of them out there.
Come on Bro.

65
00:03:44.411 --> 00:03:48.850
You must hate America.
No Way.
Secretly.
And I love the mustangs.

66
00:03:48.851 --> 00:03:53.610
I've got three of them,
myself included,
a real 68 Shelby.
But uh,
um,

67
00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:58.000
is it the shape or the color scheme?
I think it's this shape.
I mean,

68
00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:02.260
to me it's,
it's such a popular car in the movie that you know,

69
00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:06.670
too many people did it and now everybody's doing it and,
and that's what I have.

70
00:04:06.671 --> 00:04:08.470
Yeah.
Yeah.
But I mean,

71
00:04:08.471 --> 00:04:11.960
how many of them are out there in comparison to like say a modern Zr One?

72
00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.880
There's probably nearly as many of those out there.
Thousands of those.
Oh yeah.

73
00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:20.230
Really?
Yeah.
There's different companies making tons of them.

74
00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:23.920
All car people say that they say two cars that they think are played out,

75
00:04:23.921 --> 00:04:25.750
69 Camaro's and these things,

76
00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:30.430
like everybody does a 69 Camaro and everybody does Eleanor.
Yeah.
And the uh,

77
00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:33.730
the Dukes of Hazzard car.
Oh yeah.
Same thing.
Yeah.
You know,

78
00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.160
now a badass 69 charger,
don't get me wrong,

79
00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:39.850
but painted orange with a flag on top that's played out.

80
00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:44.830
You can't do that anymore.
That flag.
It's fucking persona non grata for sure.

81
00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:46.540
You believe they pulled that show off the air?

82
00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:50.200
Did Cousin yes cause the flag that shows off the air,

83
00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:54.370
but it showed on like some weird obscure cable.
Jane pulled it off a TV land.

84
00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:58.060
That's silly TV land.
I wrote a whole thing about it on Instagram.

85
00:04:58.061 --> 00:04:59.020
How ridiculous it was.
