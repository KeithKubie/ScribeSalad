00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:00.180
 a law that you will not be told 

00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.040
 As a member of the jury, you know what you can do: judge guilty, or not guilty. But there are other options. 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.549
 That is no matter what the judge or lawyer will not tell you - most of the time they are not allowed to do so, at the same time 

00:00:08.549 --> 00:00:10.429
 You may not know "not sure". 

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:14.019
 This video will tell you the third option, but note: it’s possible to just "watch" 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:18.080
 So that you can never serve in the jury - so this is the last chance you pressed the pause button 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:19.610
 Before you know... 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:23.740
 Jury veto: When the defendant is 100% reasonably found guilty, "but" 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:28.480
 The jurors "at the same time" think that he should not be punished. The jury can ignore the law and release him without guilt 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:33.050
 But before you next serve as a jury and call the judge a "veto!" you should know first. 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.860
 Inappropriate circumstances, even just talking about the jury veto may also cause you to be arrested. 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.230
 However, if this film is just a "presence" that affirms the jury veto, and 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.989
 "There is absolutely no intention to advocate" is completely ok. 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.970
 Additional note: (CGP Grey is not a lawyer, this is not a legal advice but for entertainment purposes only) 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:51.790
 Seriously, everyone, don’t do anything online to tell you in the court. 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:52.809
 Not kidding. ) 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:57.340
 So why can't you do this? Because the veto does not stand in the "legal" of the legal text, but as 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:59.239
 The logical result of the other two regulations exists: 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:03.040
 First: jurors cannot be punished for making "wrong" judgments - whether or not there are clear witnesses, 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.950
 DNA, or video shows that the defendant is guilty. The focus of the jury is to be a final arbitrator. 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:08.080
 as well as 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.260
 Second: If the defendant is found not guilty, then he will no longer be tried 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:13.220
 The same crime. 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.610
 So there are only two options that can be stipulated: guilty or not guilty, just because the jury’s waiver is used 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.250
 When the jurors’ arguments are not in line with the considerations (meaning, for example, the jury’s considerations seem to be guilty of the law but they do not consider the accused to be punished) – plus they cannot be punished 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.320
 At the same time, the final acquittal they made could not be changed. 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.420
 These regulations are necessary for the jury to be in a fair system, but the logical result is that ..... 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.860
 Controversial--the argument that lawyers and judges abstain from jury is like physicists arguing 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.840
 Like quantum mechanics. Both are difficult to observe while the two are generally explaining 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.950
 There are great differences in philosophical significance. 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.979
 Then such veto power is the exercise of people’s will, or an anarchist act, or just 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:46.710
 What is the way citizens judge the law? 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.900
 An example of a veto power is the case of the fugitive slave law: that is, when the jury in the north 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.330
 The veto is judged and the black slave is acquitted. 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:54.350
 I have no opinion on this. 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:59.119
 But the comparison is an example of deliberate disregard of the law. The southern jury refused to convict those white people who used lynchings against black people. 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:00.310
 This is not very human. 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.450
 But both are the same as jury's disregard of the law. 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.670
 In fact, the jury has "two" choices when they say that the words do not match the judgment. 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.370
 The jury veto is usually used in cases where the final judgment is not guilty, but the jury can also convict the defendant without evidence. 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.000
 Just as they can release the accused without sin 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.980
 This is also a type of jury veto, in which case they are protected by the first law, however 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.190
 The second rule does not apply, and the judges have the ability to dismiss their guilty rulings. 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.530
 The judge considered the jury .... is a problem. Of course, the guilty verdict is able to continue to appeal. 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.120
 This makes the guilty ruling of the jury veto is weaker than the acquittal. 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.510
 Do not be sad. 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.230
 Given that there is a possibility that the jurors will veto the law as mentioned above, we can not see it unexpectedly. 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.420
 Lawyers who exist under the rule of law society when we are doing juror candidates for screening 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.810
 Ask questions about the veto, and usually in a more roundabout way: 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.569
 Do you think that you will be able to make a judgment that is not in accordance with the provisions of the law? 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:52.239
 After you know what the jury veto is, you might think that "will" is a better choice. 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:56.250
 But then you will not get the jury qualification, but if you answer "no" in order to be a juror and make a judgment that ignores the law. 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.819
 Then you commit a false oath (a more academic argument is a violation of federal law). 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:02.709
 This approach can be said to be the best strategy for the jury to shut up. 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:07.030
 But this has another problem for those who have an intention to veto the law: Tell the other 11 jurors 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:12.019
 The veto will make your situation risky, which will make the veto unable to play its role as a correction of the unfair bill. 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:13.650
 And become a national issue 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.629
 (Not to mention that 95% of US criminal cases are not convicted in the final trial. 

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:20.879
 Instead, it ends with a confession negotiation, and this is another story. 

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:24.629
 The only question now is that the jurors should be "informed" of the jury's veto power? 

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:28.450
 Judging from the position of the general court, their decision would be: "I don't think about it" 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:32.409
 This seems selfish and right - but the existence of the court is to follow the law - but it is indeed a proof 

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:36.580
 Telling the jury that a veto will change their decision at the final judgment will result in less evidence of court evidence than their decision. 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:41.349
 This is not surprising: this is "the so-called jury veto." Simulated trial 

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:45.060
 It also shows that it is easier for a more sympathetic defendant to obtain a acquittal before the jury who knows the jury’s veto power. 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.870
 A defendant who is not sympathized will easily get a guilty verdict 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.310
 Compared to the results of trials that do not know the jury’s waiver 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.409
 It sounds terrible, and we know that if the jurors 

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:57.080
 It’s very unfair to just follow the legal provisions blindly. 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:01.400
 In the end, is such a system capable of exercising justice, or anarchism, or helping citizens to legislate? 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:06.909
 The decision is in your hands -- but as long as the court system is fair, these regulations are needed. 

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:13.909
 So the jury veto will always be with us.
