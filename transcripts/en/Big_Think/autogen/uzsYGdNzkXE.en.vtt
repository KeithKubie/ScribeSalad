increasing at a catastrophic rate the
 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.780
increasing at a catastrophic rate the
causes of its increasing are that

of that is the clear cutting of forests

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.360
of that is the clear cutting of forests

remember when I worked at Google I gave

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:23.270
remember when I worked at Google I gave
 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:27.610
remember when I worked at Google I gave
a talk to 3,000 young Indian Googlers in

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620
a talk to 3,000 young Indian Googlers in
 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:28.990
a talk to 3,000 young Indian Googlers in
Hyderabad and I asked them to raise

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000
Hyderabad and I asked them to raise
 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.520
Hyderabad and I asked them to raise
their hand if their grandparents were

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530
their hand if their grandparents were
 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:32.790
their hand if their grandparents were
vegetarian they all raised their hand

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:32.800
vegetarian they all raised their hand
 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.930
vegetarian they all raised their hand
then I asked them to raise their hand if

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:34.940
then I asked them to raise their hand if
 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.050
then I asked them to raise their hand if
their parents were vegetarians and about

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060
their parents were vegetarians and about
 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:41.080
their parents were vegetarians and about
1/2 raise their hand and I asked if they

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090
1/2 raise their hand and I asked if they
 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:42.970
1/2 raise their hand and I asked if they
were vegetarians and no one raised their

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:42.980
were vegetarians and no one raised their
 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:48.040
were vegetarians and no one raised their
hand and I think that's that leads to

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:48.050
hand and I think that's that leads to
 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:50.920
hand and I think that's that leads to
the increase in chickens and pigs that

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930
the increase in chickens and pigs that
 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:52.810
the increase in chickens and pigs that
we've been seeing in China and India not

we've been seeing in China and India not
 

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:55.480
we've been seeing in China and India not
not that pig selection in India that

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:55.490
not that pig selection in India that
 

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:58.390
not that pig selection in India that
means that the kind of way in which in

means that the kind of way in which in
 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.960
means that the kind of way in which in
