00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.975
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:10.430
I'm Noah Falstein.

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:12.210
I'm chief game
designer at Google.

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.860
And this is my 36th year in
the games industry and also

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:17.520
GDC number 28.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:18.970
So I've worked on
a lot of games,

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:20.490
and it's taught me
to be a survivor

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.081
in this industry that's
constantly reinventing itself.

00:00:24.081 --> 00:00:25.580
If you've been in
the games industry

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.590
for 10 years, maybe
even five, you've

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:30.170
seen how you're constantly
having to learn new skills

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:32.299
and explore new horizons.

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:34.490
And there have been a lot
of boom and bust cycles

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:35.910
over the years.

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.840
I put numbers on this
chart originally,

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.272
but it's actually
different for all of us.

00:00:41.272 --> 00:00:42.980
But really groundbreaking
things-- things

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.880
like the first game consoles out
there or the onset of the world

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.150
wide web or
smartphones-- those kinds

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:51.800
of things come around only
once every decade or so.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.380
And we're due for another
revolution that's every bit as

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:57.360
big and as important as those.

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.970
I think this is something
called transmogrified reality.

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:04.080
It's really a mix
of virtual reality,

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.430
augmented reality, and a lot
of other new technologies

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.200
and some emerging ones that
are finally showing promise

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.970
that they've been promising
to us for many years.

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.710
But specifically-- tomorrow
I'll go into more depth

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.540
on that at 4:30.

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.940
Right now, I'd like to focus
on one essential component

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.680
to what's going to make this
all work out-- Google's Project

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:24.400
Tango.

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.110
So how many of you have
heard of Project Tango?

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:27.610
OK.

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:29.551
Anybody have a developer kit?

00:01:29.551 --> 00:01:30.050
OK.

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:32.500
There's a couple
of them out there.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.870
He's a cheater.

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:36.480
It was just announced last June.

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.967
And it's a sensor
platform that's

00:01:38.967 --> 00:01:41.425
designed to give mobile devices
a human-scale understanding

00:01:41.425 --> 00:01:42.650
of their surroundings.

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:46.290
So they can basically see
what's in the room around them.

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.270
That means that now
a phone or a tablet

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.450
can know precisely where it
is while moving in 3D space.

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.070
It can sense the depth of
objects in a near view.

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:55.990
And it can also learn
and remember and map

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.010
the area around it.

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:00.700
So in 15-second chunks,
a little bit more info.

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.270
First, motion tracking it does
with six degrees of freedom,

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.780
using a wide-angle
camera and data

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.340
from high-res accelerometers
and gyroscopes

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.040
to follow the tablet through
space, back and forth, all six

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.590
degrees of freedom.

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.300
Second, it's got a
depth sensor that

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.860
can bounce infrared light off
of objects and surfaces that

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.910
range from about half a meter
out to three meters in range.

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.710
And it passes that
information back to the API.

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:27.250
And I'll be showing
a video of some

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.160
of that working in
tomorrow's talk.

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.980
Third, a Tango device has the
ability to learn and remember

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.410
its surroundings, and it
recognizes those areas

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.800
on a subsequent pass-through and
then refines its map each time.

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.760
So it gets an
increasingly better model

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.290
as it goes through
the same area.

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.030
And this has
tremendous implications

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.370
for business apps and also other
non-entertainment applications.

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.310
So for one thing,
consider how great

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.700
it would be for real
estate sales and rentals

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.180
to be able to scan in
a room or an apartment

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:00.010
and view your existing furniture
in the new place in real time.

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:01.330
But what about games?

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.470
Well, in the past,
new technologies

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:04.860
have enabled new game genres.

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.407
And I think this is going to
be no different than that.

00:03:07.407 --> 00:03:09.740
All the while, while you're
working on these new genres,

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:11.230
you'll also be
learning about things

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.688
that are going to be really
important in this new mobile VR

00:03:13.688 --> 00:03:17.990
market that's going to be a
big deal in the next few years.

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:20.410
So one way is to
consider that Tango is

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:22.520
a window into a virtual world.

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:25.360
There have been previous three
degrees of freedom solutions

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.610
that mean you can stand in
one place and sort of pivot

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:30.280
the phone or tablet around
and look into a virtual world.

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.020
And that's not bad.

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:34.600
But Tango lets you go into
the six degrees of freedom.

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.670
So you're not only
pivoting in place,

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:38.780
but you can move from
side to side, up and down.

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:41.140
And it knows where you,
how high off the ground.

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.100
And you can translate
and scale that.

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:45.170
It doesn't have to
be a one-to-one scale

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:47.280
as you do that for your game.

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.770
Or maybe even more
important, Tango

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:52.640
can allow people to quickly
scan in their surroundings, both

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.830
the boundaries of the
room and its contents.

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:57.080
And that'll let you
make games in places

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:58.920
where people actually
live, which I think

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.780
is going to be very exciting.

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.300
So for example, a whole
new genre of games

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:05.040
would be actual stealth games.

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.680
You don't just cause an
avatar to move around.

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.080
You actually move
stealthily yourself.

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.320
So imagine a spy game
where you're actually

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:14.660
moving through a maze
of laser detectors,

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:17.040
never exceeding one foot
per second of velocity,

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:21.279
perhaps watching yourself
mirrored on an Android TV.

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:24.464
Or, for more visceral content,
if you scan in your home

00:04:24.464 --> 00:04:26.380
and have that be the
setting of a procedurally

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.720
generated action game or maybe
a mystery or maybe a horror

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:30.526
thriller.

00:04:30.526 --> 00:04:31.900
And think how much
more immersive

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.066
it'll be when you stop
playing that horror thriller,

00:04:34.066 --> 00:04:36.080
and you take the headset
off, but you're still

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:37.450
in the same room.

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:39.280
Interesting stuff.

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:42.120
So head-mounted
displays-- I'm implying

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.210
that we'll move into that.

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:45.860
I think that's a
logical next step.

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.780
And consider that a Tango
head-mounted display could

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:50.570
let the real world
through with its camera

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:53.740
or replace real obstacles with
virtual images to any degree

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.670
that it wants,
maybe even allowing

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:59.559
us to move untethered
through space safely.

00:04:59.559 --> 00:05:01.100
But those are just
some of our ideas.

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:04.460
We're here because we want you
to apply for the Tango Program,

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:06.380
get a developer kit,
make your own blend

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:08.100
of the real and the virtual.

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:11.000
And Google tango dev
kit for more info.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.292
We'll also have demos on the
expo floor starting Wednesday,

00:05:14.292 --> 00:05:15.750
as well as Project
Cardboard, which

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:17.150
is really relevant to this.

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:19.190
And you can sign up to
buy a dev system there.

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:19.910
And thanks.

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:23.550
I can't wait to see what you
guys create for all of us.

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:27.782
[APPLAUSE]
