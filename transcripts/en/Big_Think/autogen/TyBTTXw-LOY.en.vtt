debate and candidates taking aside on
 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.560
debate and candidates taking aside on
the issue and I think it's very clear

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570
the issue and I think it's very clear
 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:51.160
the issue and I think it's very clear
that evangelical and very conservative

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170
that evangelical and very conservative
 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.700
that evangelical and very conservative

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.189

you know it's very clear that candidates

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940
you know it's very clear that candidates
 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.779
you know it's very clear that candidates
are you know are leaning one way or the

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789
are you know are leaning one way or the
 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:03.889
are you know are leaning one way or the
other one when it comes to their

other one when it comes to their
 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.010
other one when it comes to their
approach of them and their viewpoints

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020
approach of them and their viewpoints
 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.780
approach of them and their viewpoints
have to be taken seriously on the

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790
have to be taken seriously on the
 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.510
have to be taken seriously on the
political spectrum and that's the you

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520
political spectrum and that's the you
 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.330
political spectrum and that's the you
know it's there that these things are

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340
know it's there that these things are
 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:20.990
know it's there that these things are
going to change I have a personal issue

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000
going to change I have a personal issue
 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.590
going to change I have a personal issue
with the idea that some people can

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600
with the idea that some people can
 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.550
with the idea that some people can
tolerate homosexuality I do not tolerate

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560
tolerate homosexuality I do not tolerate
 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.310
tolerate homosexuality I do not tolerate
women I do not tolerate black or Asian

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320
women I do not tolerate black or Asian
 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.370
women I do not tolerate black or Asian
people I embrace them as I would anyone

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380
people I embrace them as I would anyone
 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.950
people I embrace them as I would anyone
else and so I think right now we're

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960
else and so I think right now we're
 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.190
else and so I think right now we're
sending this message of tolerance and I

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200
sending this message of tolerance and I
 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.749
sending this message of tolerance and I
think it is a stepping stone toward

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759
think it is a stepping stone toward
 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.420
think it is a stepping stone toward
embracing or even so much so that it's a

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430
embracing or even so much so that it's a
 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.179
embracing or even so much so that it's a
non-issue I think right now that the

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189
non-issue I think right now that the
 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:52.719
non-issue I think right now that the
goal needs to be to promote this as a

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:52.729
goal needs to be to promote this as a
 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:55.910
goal needs to be to promote this as a
normalized sort of behavior and I think

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920
normalized sort of behavior and I think
 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.620
normalized sort of behavior and I think
that if we're taking these sort of

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630
that if we're taking these sort of
 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.709
that if we're taking these sort of
band-aid or sideways approaches to get

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719
band-aid or sideways approaches to get
 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.359
band-aid or sideways approaches to get
to our final result we're going to end

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369
to our final result we're going to end
 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.249
to our final result we're going to end
up with something that's still not

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259
up with something that's still not
 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.010
up with something that's still not
viewed very well so the I think the

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020
viewed very well so the I think the
 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.580
viewed very well so the I think the
message we need to be pitching is this

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590
message we need to be pitching is this
 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.400
message we need to be pitching is this
sort of normalized behavior

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410
sort of normalized behavior
 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.070
sort of normalized behavior
gay people are just like straight people

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080
gay people are just like straight people

that's really all it comes down to I
 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.490
that's really all it comes down to I
think it's easy for me to say that's

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500
think it's easy for me to say that's
 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.650
think it's easy for me to say that's
such a simple message not only because I

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660
such a simple message not only because I
 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.750
such a simple message not only because I
live in a very urban area but I'm a gay

think it's very easy for you know other
 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:32.830
think it's very easy for you know other
folks and more conservative parts of the

folks and more conservative parts of the
 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:41.200
folks and more conservative parts of the
country to accept that message I think

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:41.210
country to accept that message I think
 

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:44.380

it is a non-issue and while that may it
 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.590
it is a non-issue and while that may it
be the case in many hiv-positive people

HIV and getting tested
 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:26.650
HIV and getting tested
I think the there's a huge part of that

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660
I think the there's a huge part of that
 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.140
I think the there's a huge part of that
equation missing what do you do when you

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150
equation missing what do you do when you
 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.630
equation missing what do you do when you
get tested it's one thing to walk into a

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:31.640
get tested it's one thing to walk into a
 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.340
get tested it's one thing to walk into a
free clinic and have your blood drawn

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.350
free clinic and have your blood drawn
 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:36.520
free clinic and have your blood drawn
it's another thing for you know you to

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530
it's another thing for you know you to
 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:38.200
it's another thing for you know you to
be told the results that you're positive

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:38.210
be told the results that you're positive
 

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:40.420

and then there are zero marketing
 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:43.000
and then there are zero marketing
messages about what goes on there and I

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010
messages about what goes on there and I
 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:45.400
messages about what goes on there and I
think that that's a huge dilemma getting

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:45.410
think that that's a huge dilemma getting
 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:48.160
think that that's a huge dilemma getting
people tested is the first part beyond

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.170
people tested is the first part beyond
 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:50.260
people tested is the first part beyond
that it's almost as if that that whole

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:50.270
that it's almost as if that that whole
 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:52.600
that it's almost as if that that whole
possibility has been ignored

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:52.610
possibility has been ignored

possibility has been ignored
I do think especially in in New York

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:56.690
I do think especially in in New York
 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:59.710
I do think especially in in New York
City that the the use of you know

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720
City that the the use of you know

crystal meth has is resurging among

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:03.770
crystal meth has is resurging among
 

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:05.590
crystal meth has is resurging among
young people and that leads to plenty of

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:05.600
young people and that leads to plenty of
 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.750
young people and that leads to plenty of
unprotected sex and I think it is you

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.760
unprotected sex and I think it is you
 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.960
unprotected sex and I think it is you
know this carefree lifestyle but again I

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:10.970
know this carefree lifestyle but again I
 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:12.760
know this carefree lifestyle but again I
think it's up to you know each

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:12.770
think it's up to you know each
 

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:15.400
think it's up to you know each
individual to to really make that call

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:15.410
individual to to really make that call
 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:17.590
individual to to really make that call
and to protect themselves but there are

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:17.600
and to protect themselves but there are
 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.570
and to protect themselves but there are
so many industries out there that can

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:19.580
so many industries out there that can
 

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:25.029
