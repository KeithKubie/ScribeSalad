00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:04.372
Now you know how to give 3D objects a variety of interesting materials and to

00:00:04.372 --> 00:00:08.420
make them look good. The next step is to learn how to precisely position and

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:12.692

00:00:12.692 --> 00:00:16.913
material and object transformation, you'll be able to really control your

00:00:16.913 --> 00:00:17.823
virtual world.
