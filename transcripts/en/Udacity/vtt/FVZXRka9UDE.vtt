00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:04.490
If you think back to lesson five,
you'll recall how large and

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:07.410
complex the data standards are.

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.150
This is an arbitrary,
human anatomy, physiology, and

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:13.390
diseases are very complex.

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:15.550
To be accurate, and

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:18.969
electronic record must be able
to capture the nuances of care.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.230
To be maximally useful it would ideally
capture most of this as structured

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:25.880
coded information.

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.260
How do you do that?

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.210
How can you provide busy physicians
with a way to accurately and

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.280
efficiently capture such
a complex data set?

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:38.700
That's the EHR data capture challenge,
and it has been with us for decades.

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.080
The most common approach is this,
a template.

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.790
Essentially an electronic version
of the paper check-off forms

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:48.440
physicians have used for
years in their practices.
