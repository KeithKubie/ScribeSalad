00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:03.600
I want to show you a way that,
at least, I find more useful to

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.400
subtract numbers in my head.

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.000
And I do it this way-- it's
not necessarily faster on

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.730
paper, but it allows you to
remember what you're doing.

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:12.810
Because if you start borrowing
and stuff it becomes very hard

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:14.580
to remember what's
actually going on.

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.290
So let's try out a
couple of problems.

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:27.270
Let's have 9,456 minus 7,589.

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:29.640
So the way I do
this in my head.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.040
I say that 9,456 minus
7,589-- you have to

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.560
remember the two numbers.

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:40.910
So the first thing I do is
I say, well, what's 9,456

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.140
minus is just 7,000?

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.220
That's pretty easy because I
just take 9,000 minus 7,000.

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:51.750
So what I can do is I'll
cross out this and I'll

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.720
subtract 7,000 from it.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:58.030
And I'm going to get 2,456.

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:05.330
So in my head I tell myself
that 9,456 minus 7,589 is the

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.600
same thing as-- if I just
subtract out the 7,000--

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.150
as 2,456 minus 589.

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.140
I took the 7,000 out
of the picture.

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.110
I essentially subtracted it
from both of these numbers.

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:25.510
Now, if I want to do 2,456
minus 589 what I do is I

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:28.820
subtract 500 from both
of these numbers.

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.340
So if I subtract 500 from
this bottom number,

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:32.990
this 5 will go away.

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.230
And if I subtract 500 from this
top number, what happens?

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:39.510
What's 2,456 minus 500?

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:41.170
Or an easier way to
think about it?

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:42.650
What's 24 minus 5?

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:44.010
Well, that's 19.

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:48.870
So it's going to be 1,956.

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:50.820
Let me scroll up a little bit.

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.240
So it's 1,956.

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:57.540
So my original problem has now
been reduced to 1,956 minus 89.

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.340
Now I can subtract 80 from both
that number and that number.

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.840
So if I subtract 80 from this
bottom number the 8 disappears.

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.100
898 minus 80 is just 9.

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.470
And I subtract 80 from this top
number, I can just think of,

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.480
well, what's 195 minus 8?

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.170
Well, 195 minus 8, let's see.

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.060
15 minus 8 is 17.

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:25.300
So 195 minus 8 is going
to be 187 and then you

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:26.600
still have the 6 there.

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:32.050
So essentially I said,
1,956 minus 80 is 1,876.

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:35.990
And now my problem has been
reduced to 1,876 minus 9.

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:37.430
And then we can do
that in our head.

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.630
What's 76 minus 9?

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:40.340
That's what?

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:41.840
67.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:47.860
So our final answer is 1,867.

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.890
And as you can see this isn't
necessarily faster than the way

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.370
we've done it in other videos.

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.040
But the reason why I like it
is that at any stage, I just

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.580
have to remember two numbers.

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.030
I have to remember my
new top number and my

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.880
new bottom number.

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.490
My new bottom number is always
just some of the leftover

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:05.180
digits of the original
bottom number.

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.060
So that's how I like to
do things in my head.

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.490
Now, just to make sure that we
got the right answer and maybe

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:13.060
to compare and contrast
a little bit.

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.020
Let's do it the
traditional way.

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:25.030
9,456 minus 7,589.

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.280
So the standard way of doing
it, I like to do all my

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.180
borrowing before I do any of my
subtraction so that I can stay

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.110
in my borrowing mode, or you
can think of it as regrouping.

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:37.740
So I look at all of my numbers
on top and see, are they all

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:39.190
larger than the numbers
on the bottom?

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:40.590
And I start here at the right.

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.610
6 is definitely not larger
than 9, so I have to borrow.

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:46.680
So I'll borrow 10 or I'll
borrow 1 from the 10's place,

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.010
which ends up being 10.

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:53.090
So the 6 becomes a 16 and
then the 5 becomes a 4.

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:54.120
Then I go to the 10's place.

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.000
4 needs to be larger than
8, so let me borrow 1

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.420
from the 100's place.

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:03.290
So then that 4 becomes a 14
or fourteen 10's because

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:04.310
we're in the 10's place.

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:07.200
And then this 4 becomes a 3.

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.095
Now these two columns or places
look good, but right here I

00:04:10.095 --> 00:04:12.120
have a 3, which is
less than a 5.

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.380
Not cool, so I have
to borrow again.

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:18.810
That 3 becomes a 13 and
then that 9 becomes an 8.

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:21.520
And now I'm ready to subtract.

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:24.440
So you get 16 minus 9 is 7.

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:27.190
14 minus 8 is 16.

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:29.570
13 minus 5 is 8.

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:31.030
8 minus 7 is 1.

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:33.840
And lucky for us, we
got the right answer.

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:34.640
I want to make it very clear.

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:36.580
There's no better
way to do this.

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.780
This way is actually kind of
longer and it takes up more

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:43.180
space on your paper than this
way was, but this for me,

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:44.500
is very hard to remember.

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:47.690
It's very hard for me to keep
track of what I borrowed and

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:50.020
what the other number
is and et cetera.

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:51.970
But here, at any point
in time, I just have to

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:53.670
remember two numbers.

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:56.560
And the two numbers get
simpler every step that I

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.640
go through this process.

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:00.190
So this is why I think
that this is a little

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:01.380
bit easier in my head.

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:04.140
But this might be, depending on
the context, easier on paper.

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:06.630
But at least here you didn't
have to borrow or regroup.

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:09.420
Well, hopefully you find
that a little bit useful.
