00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Let's get started.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.900
Can you hear me back there?
Loud and clear.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.350
OK.
Let's get started.

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:23.716
Before I begin,
just a couple of announcements.

00:00:23.716 --> 00:00:29.783
Brad Buren is one of our
students here and he needs a

00:00:29.783 --> 00:00:34.486
note-taker.
It's a paid position.

00:00:34.486 --> 00:00:41.473
So if you are interested you
can stop by after class and see

00:00:41.473 --> 00:00:45.144
him.
He's sitting right here out

00:00:45.144 --> 00:00:49.644
there, OK?
Second, just a reminder that

00:00:49.644 --> 00:00:56.750
6.002 does have prerequisites.
And the prerequisites are 8.02

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.746
and 18.03.
So with that let me start off

00:01:01.746 --> 00:01:06.103
with the usual.
Do a quick review of what we've

00:01:06.103 --> 00:01:10.080
done so far.
So we started out life looking

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.384
at the laws of physics and
Maxwell's equations and so on.

00:01:15.384 --> 00:01:21.256
And those were way too hard so
we said let's make life easy for

00:01:21.256 --> 00:01:24.760
ourselves.
So we chose to play in this

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:30.064
playground in which we said we
shall adhere to the lumped

00:01:30.064 --> 00:01:33.250
matter discipline.
OK?

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.342
The LMD.
So we are in that playground.

00:01:36.342 --> 00:01:40.770
So this entire course,
and for that matter large parts

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.031
of EECS are within that
playground, within which the

00:01:45.031 --> 00:01:47.704
lumped matter discipline
applies.

00:01:47.704 --> 00:01:51.297
So as soon as we jumped into
the playground,

00:01:51.297 --> 00:01:54.806
the LMD playground,
we could take Maxwell's

00:01:54.806 --> 00:01:58.566
equations and abstract them out
into two very,

00:01:58.566 --> 00:02:02.577
very simple rules.
And the very simple rules were

00:02:02.577 --> 00:02:08.011
KVL and KCL.
KVL simply said that I can sum

00:02:08.011 --> 00:02:13.631
the voltages in any loop in a
circuit and the result then

00:02:13.631 --> 00:02:17.446
would be zero.
Similarly, I can sum the

00:02:17.446 --> 00:02:23.468
currents that enter or exit any
node and the sum will also be

00:02:23.468 --> 00:02:26.579
zero.
So what you can now do is,

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:32.000
if you feel like,
you can go around and brag.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.450
Oh, yeah, we use Maxwell's
equations in everyday life and,

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.277
yeah, it's good stuff.
And the key is that this is

00:02:40.277 --> 00:02:44.727
really an encapsulation of
Maxwell's equations within this

00:02:44.727 --> 00:02:48.866
playground that we are in.
So I talked about the first

00:02:48.866 --> 00:02:52.458
method of circuit analysis in
the last lecture.

00:02:52.458 --> 00:02:56.596
And that method simply took
the, wrote KVL for all the

00:02:56.596 --> 00:03:00.813
loops, wrote KCL for all the
nodes and wrote element vi

00:03:00.813 --> 00:03:05.877
relationships.
And together gave you a big

00:03:05.877 --> 00:03:10.885
bunch of equations.
And you sat down and grunged

00:03:10.885 --> 00:03:17.172
through the equations and you
solved for branch voltages and

00:03:17.172 --> 00:03:21.327
currents.
So we reviewed a second method

00:03:21.327 --> 00:03:26.762
of circuit analysis.
And I'll simply call it circuit

00:03:26.762 --> 00:03:30.729
composition.
The basic idea behind this

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:34.785
method was to learn some simple
rules of how resistors add and

00:03:34.785 --> 00:03:38.775
conductances add and so on and
so forth and look at a circuit

00:03:38.775 --> 00:03:42.500
and simplify the circuit by
making series simplifications

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.157
when the resistors are in series
and so on and so forth,

00:03:46.157 --> 00:03:50.214
and compose it and play around
with it till we end up with the

00:03:50.214 --> 00:03:53.206
current, the voltages that we
are looking for.

00:03:53.206 --> 00:03:58.727
This is the intuitive method.
And so a section in Chapter 2,

00:03:58.727 --> 00:04:04.363
I believe, of the course notes
discusses several examples using

00:04:04.363 --> 00:04:09.363
this method and attempts to make
a little bit formal the

00:04:09.363 --> 00:04:13.818
intuitive approach that is
applied in this method.

00:04:13.818 --> 00:04:17.090
So we then looked at the node
method.

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:22.727
And the node method was simply
a particular way of applying KVL

00:04:22.727 --> 00:04:24.545
and KCL.
Node method,

00:04:24.545 --> 00:04:27.363
remember?
We took a ground node.

00:04:27.363 --> 00:04:32.363
Then we labeled the nodes of
the remaining voltages with

00:04:32.363 --> 00:04:39.222
respect to that ground.
Then we wrote KCL for each of

00:04:39.222 --> 00:04:43.666
the nodes.
And when we wrote KCL for each

00:04:43.666 --> 00:04:48.333
of the nodes,
remember, KVL was implicit in

00:04:48.333 --> 00:04:55.222
this expression that we used for
each of the currents that were

00:04:55.222 --> 00:05:01.154
exiting each node.
So if Ej was a node voltage,

00:05:01.154 --> 00:05:07.464
then Ej minus Ei multiplied by
the conductance Gi was the

00:05:07.464 --> 00:05:12.309
current that was going through
one of those,

00:05:12.309 --> 00:05:17.605
I should call it Gij.
This is a conductance that

00:05:17.605 --> 00:05:23.464
connects nodes i and j.
That gave us the KVL that fed

00:05:23.464 --> 00:05:30.000
into the same system.
So these are three methods.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.038
The node method,
by the way, is sort of the

00:05:33.038 --> 00:05:37.523
workhorse of the 6.002 industry.
And for that matter for all of

00:05:37.523 --> 00:05:40.127
the circuits industry.
When in doubt,

00:05:40.127 --> 00:05:42.659
apply the mode method,
you'll be OK.

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:46.348
That applies to linear
circuits, nonlinear circuits,

00:05:46.348 --> 00:05:49.459
what have you.
What I'm going to do today is

00:05:49.459 --> 00:05:53.510
go through two more methods.
So notice that the first few

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:57.489
lectures of this course,
the first three lectures simply

00:05:57.489 --> 00:06:01.685
comprise transitioning you from
the world of physics to the

00:06:01.685 --> 00:06:06.526
world of EECS.
And then two lectures on giving

00:06:06.526 --> 00:06:10.438
you a bag of tricks.
So we start you off with the

00:06:10.438 --> 00:06:14.106
sort of tools,
your mallets and chisels and so

00:06:14.106 --> 00:06:17.937
on and so forth.
And these five methods are your

00:06:17.937 --> 00:06:20.463
tools.
We'll look at two methods

00:06:20.463 --> 00:06:23.479
today.
One method is called the method

00:06:23.479 --> 00:06:28.369
of superposition and the second
method is called the Thevenin

00:06:28.369 --> 00:06:32.852
method.
And these methods apply only to

00:06:32.852 --> 00:06:36.809
linear circuits.
So we look at the subset of

00:06:36.809 --> 00:06:41.871
circuits that are linear,
and these two methods apply to

00:06:41.871 --> 00:06:46.564
only those circuits.
These are methods that combined

00:06:46.564 --> 00:06:51.901
with intuition really enables
you to solve very interesting

00:06:51.901 --> 00:06:54.386
circuits very,
very quickly.

00:06:54.386 --> 00:07:00.000
So let me do an example using a
usual node method.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.253
And then jump into introducing
the superposition methods and

00:07:05.253 --> 00:07:08.815
Thevenin methods using that same
example.

00:07:08.815 --> 00:07:13.000
So let me draw you an example
circuit here.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.137
So, again, I'm using this
example, I will use this example

00:07:37.137 --> 00:07:41.201
to introduce the method of
superposition and the Thevenin

00:07:41.201 --> 00:07:43.596
method.
So what I'm going to do is

00:07:43.596 --> 00:07:47.516
start off the usual way and
analyze the circuit using a

00:07:47.516 --> 00:07:50.491
method that you know now,
the node method.

00:07:50.491 --> 00:07:54.846
And what I'll do is write down
the node equations for this by

00:07:54.846 --> 00:07:58.475
applying the node method.
So if you recall the node

00:07:58.475 --> 00:08:01.443
method.
I choose a ground node.

00:08:01.443 --> 00:08:04.895
I'm going to choose this node.
It's got both the voltage

00:08:04.895 --> 00:08:08.096
source connected to it,
and it's also got many other

00:08:08.096 --> 00:08:11.359
edges impinging on it.
So I'm going to choose that as

00:08:11.359 --> 00:08:15.313
my ground node and I'm going to
label the other nodes with their

00:08:15.313 --> 00:08:17.259
voltages.
So this is an unknown.

00:08:17.259 --> 00:08:19.958
I'll label it as e.
I guess we just have one

00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:22.468
unknown e.
And I know the voltage of this

00:08:22.468 --> 00:08:24.979
node, and that is simply V.
Since it's V,

00:08:24.979 --> 00:08:28.493
there's a voltage source
between the ground node and that

00:08:28.493 --> 00:08:32.906
node.
So what I can do next is that I

00:08:32.906 --> 00:08:38.718
can write down the node equation
for this node and then go from

00:08:38.718 --> 00:08:42.187
there.
So let me go ahead and do that.

00:08:42.187 --> 00:08:46.218
So let me sum up the currents
going outside,

00:08:46.218 --> 00:08:50.343
going outwards.
So I have e minus v divide by

00:08:50.343 --> 00:08:56.156
R1, I have e minus zero divide
by R2, and I have minus i equals

00:08:56.156 --> 00:09:00.000
zero.
This is a node equation.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:06.363
The first thing I want you to
observe is that this equation is

00:09:06.363 --> 00:09:11.266
linear in V and i.
What I mean by linear is that

00:09:11.266 --> 00:09:17.629
you don't see terms like Vi or
V-squared and things like that.

00:09:17.629 --> 00:09:23.784
It's some constant times V plus
some constant times i equals

00:09:23.784 --> 00:09:29.000
some other constant.
So that's quite nice.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:36.230
So I'm going to rearrange the
terms in the following manner.

00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:43.705
I'll move the known sources to
the right-hand side and collect

00:09:43.705 --> 00:09:50.813
the coefficients of e on this
side, so I get one by R1 plus

00:09:50.813 --> 00:09:54.000
one by R2 over here.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.934
So stare at this for a moment
and notice again here I have e,

00:10:08.934 --> 00:10:12.717
my unknown node voltage,
there is some constant

00:10:12.717 --> 00:10:17.651
multiplier, and that equals some
function of V summed up with

00:10:17.651 --> 00:10:21.763
some function of i.
And, again, notice that this is

00:10:21.763 --> 00:10:26.861
a linear combination of V and i.
No multiplication terms and so

00:10:26.861 --> 00:10:32.907
on and so forth.
This is a pretty standard form

00:10:32.907 --> 00:10:39.159
in which we will represent
equations quite often.

00:10:39.159 --> 00:10:45.802
And just to label it,
this is often labeled G as the

00:10:45.802 --> 00:10:50.882
conductance matrix.
Of course this is e,

00:10:50.882 --> 00:10:57.785
our unknown node voltages,
and this is a linear sum of

00:10:57.785 --> 00:11:02.004
sources.
So this is a very standard way

00:11:02.004 --> 00:11:04.142
that we will represent
equations.

00:11:04.142 --> 00:11:08.017
We did that last week as well,
or rather on Tuesday where I

00:11:08.017 --> 00:11:11.558
took a conductance matrix,
multiplied that by a column

00:11:11.558 --> 00:11:15.700
vector of unknown node voltages
and equated that to some linear

00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:17.905
combination of my source
voltages.

00:11:17.905 --> 00:11:21.312
The reason the circuit is
linear is that I have only

00:11:21.312 --> 00:11:25.120
linear elements in the circuit.
I don't have any nonlinear

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:27.392
elements.
And because of that I can

00:11:27.392 --> 00:11:31.000
rewrite this in the following
manner.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:39.845
I'm just going to express e as
a function of V and i and bring

00:11:39.845 --> 00:11:46.804
it over to this side.
So it's some function of i.

00:11:46.804 --> 00:11:51.879
So I get R1 R2 divide by R1
plus R2.

00:11:51.879 --> 00:12:00.000
And I bring R1 R2 to this side.
That's what I get.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:05.661
So stare at this for a few
seconds, very common form.

00:12:05.661 --> 00:12:11.322
My unknown node voltage is
equal to this stuff on the

00:12:11.322 --> 00:12:16.004
right-hand side.
The stuff on the right-hand

00:12:16.004 --> 00:12:22.754
side has a term multiplying the
source voltage V and some other

00:12:22.754 --> 00:12:29.965
term multiplying the current I.
And if I were to put this in

00:12:29.965 --> 00:12:35.791
sort of symbol-like form my
unknown node voltage is some

00:12:35.791 --> 00:12:40.239
constant times V1 plus some
constant times,

00:12:40.239 --> 00:12:45.323
is of the form constant times
the source current,

00:12:45.323 --> 00:12:49.878
constant times the source
voltage and so on.

00:12:49.878 --> 00:12:56.021
The units of As and Vs are
different because in this case A

00:12:56.021 --> 00:13:01.000
has no units because V is a
voltage.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.958
And so is e.
In this case V has units of

00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:06.917
resistance.
So that V times i gives me a

00:13:06.917 --> 00:13:09.875
voltage.
So stare at this equation for a

00:13:09.875 --> 00:13:14.503
few seconds and this should help
us build up some insight that

00:13:14.503 --> 00:13:18.979
will allow us to write down the
answer almost by inspection.

00:13:18.979 --> 00:13:22.924
I'm going to show you a method
now, in a few minutes,

00:13:22.924 --> 00:13:27.020
which will allow you to write
down the answer e just by

00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:31.268
starring at the circuit without
having to go through node

00:13:31.268 --> 00:13:36.101
equations and so on.
The more and more methods I

00:13:36.101 --> 00:13:40.383
teach you, the more you will be
able to do a lot of this

00:13:40.383 --> 00:13:44.742
completely by yourselves.
In this particular example it's

00:13:44.742 --> 00:13:48.868
a relatively simple circuit but
these methods would be

00:13:48.868 --> 00:13:52.682
particularly useful when you
have more complicated

00:13:52.682 --> 00:13:55.952
situations.
But before I go on let me spend

00:13:55.952 --> 00:14:00.000
a few minutes pontificating on
linearity.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:06.758
So that's a linear circuit.
And this equation gives me the

00:14:06.758 --> 00:14:13.399
unknown node voltage e as a
linear sum of source voltages

00:14:13.399 --> 00:14:18.260
and source currents.
Linearity implies two

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:25.138
properties, the property of
homogeneity and also gives vice

00:14:25.138 --> 00:14:30.000
to the property of
superposition.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:41.351
Let's do homogeneity first.
What this says is if I have a

00:14:41.351 --> 00:14:52.500
circuit, some circuit and I feed
it some sort of inputs,

00:14:52.500 --> 00:15:00.000
A, then let's say my output is
S.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.567
If you're feeling hungry think
of these as apples and the

00:15:04.567 --> 00:15:07.586
circuit converts them into
applesauce.

00:15:07.586 --> 00:15:12.317
So what homogeneity says is
that what I can do is if I take

00:15:12.317 --> 00:15:17.456
each of my apples and instead of
feeding it an entire apple what

00:15:17.456 --> 00:15:20.637
if I give it three-quarters of
an apple?

00:15:20.637 --> 00:15:24.797
Say I multiple all my inputs by
some constant alpha,

00:15:24.797 --> 00:15:29.047
three-quarters.
What that says is that at the

00:15:29.047 --> 00:15:33.141
output instead of getting one
full bottle of applesauce I'm

00:15:33.141 --> 00:15:36.952
going to get three-quarters of a
bottle of apple sauce.

00:15:36.952 --> 00:15:41.258
So if I proportionately reduce
all the inputs and if this is a

00:15:41.258 --> 00:15:45.494
linear circuit then so shall my
output be reduced in the same

00:15:45.494 --> 00:15:47.823
proportion.
So that's homogeneity.

00:15:47.823 --> 00:15:51.000
Next, let's look at
superposition.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:05.469
The property of superposition
says the following.

00:16:05.469 --> 00:16:12.882
The same kind of circuit.
If I feed it apples then I get

00:16:12.882 --> 00:16:17.600
applesauce.
I take the same circuit,

00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:25.686
and this time around if I feed
the circuit a different set of

00:16:25.686 --> 00:16:32.422
inputs, say blueberries.
And let's say my output,

00:16:32.422 --> 00:16:38.378
oops, let me do it this way.
So as my output I get blueberry

00:16:38.378 --> 00:16:42.719
sauce, if such exists.
So apples applesauce,

00:16:42.719 --> 00:16:46.252
blueberries give me blueberry
sauce.

00:16:46.252 --> 00:16:50.895
Then what I'm going to get if I
mix up the two,

00:16:50.895 --> 00:16:57.053
so let's say I take my circuit,
the same circuit with a set of

00:16:57.053 --> 00:17:02.000
inputs and in this example one
output.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.869
Let's say I mix up my inputs
and some of my inputs in the

00:17:06.869 --> 00:17:10.608
following way,
here I feed an A1 plus B1 and

00:17:10.608 --> 00:17:15.913
here A2 plus B2 and so on then
at the output I am going to get

00:17:15.913 --> 00:17:19.478
a mush of apple sauce and
blueberry sauce.

00:17:19.478 --> 00:17:23.739
All this says is that if I
apply just apples I get

00:17:23.739 --> 00:17:27.217
applesauce.
If I apply just blueberries I

00:17:27.217 --> 00:17:32.009
get blueberry sauce.
Then if I were to figure out

00:17:32.009 --> 00:17:35.599
how this blender would have
worked had I fed in the

00:17:35.599 --> 00:17:39.259
combinations of apples and
blueberries, then for the

00:17:39.259 --> 00:17:43.495
purposes of understanding that
blender all I could have done

00:17:43.495 --> 00:17:47.443
was taken by two outputs and
just mixed them up together

00:17:47.443 --> 00:17:50.170
myself and that's exactly what
I'd get.

00:17:50.170 --> 00:17:54.477
So if I sum up the inputs my
outputs would also be the sum of

00:17:54.477 --> 00:17:59.000
the outputs with the inputs
applied by themselves.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:03.595
So let me take this here and
munge around with hit for a few

00:18:03.595 --> 00:18:07.256
seconds and get something
interesting out of it.

00:18:07.256 --> 00:18:10.449
So notice two inputs,
two inputs, outputs.

00:18:10.449 --> 00:18:14.889
In your notes I've given you
another template for the next

00:18:14.889 --> 00:18:17.927
set of scribbles I'm going to
make here.

00:18:17.927 --> 00:18:21.510
So use the next set of
templates on page three.

00:18:21.510 --> 00:18:25.404
What I'm going to do here is
something very simple,

00:18:25.404 --> 00:18:30.000
set one output to zero and feed
a voltage V1.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:35.678
So that's feed a voltage V1 and
set the other output to zero.

00:18:35.678 --> 00:18:38.990
And let's say I get Y1 as an
output.

00:18:38.990 --> 00:18:44.479
And in this case I set the
first voltage to zero and feed a

00:18:44.479 --> 00:18:48.264
different voltage V2 on the
second input.

00:18:48.264 --> 00:18:53.470
And let's say my output is Y2.
This is just a particular

00:18:53.470 --> 00:19:00.000
application of the superposition
principle I just outlined.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.987
Apply V1 set one output to
zero.

00:19:03.987 --> 00:19:09.131
Apply V2 set the original
output to zero.

00:19:09.131 --> 00:19:17.106
Then what I'm going to find is
that the answer will simply look

00:19:17.106 --> 00:19:24.694
like this, just replace for As
and Bs what I just did and we

00:19:24.694 --> 00:19:30.868
get V1 and zero here and we get
zero and V2 here.

00:19:30.868 --> 00:19:40.000
And as my output I'm going to
get exactly the sum Y1 plus Y2.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.956
This is simply a particular
application of superposition

00:19:43.956 --> 00:19:46.690
where what I'm saying is the
following.

00:19:46.690 --> 00:19:50.647
If you look at this circuit
here effectively what have I

00:19:50.647 --> 00:19:53.093
done?
Effectively what I've done is

00:19:53.093 --> 00:19:57.122
apply the voltage V1 on one
input and a voltage V2 on the

00:19:57.122 --> 00:19:58.561
other input.
V1 here.

00:19:58.561 --> 00:20:02.169
V2 here.
And the output is Y1 plus Y2.

00:20:02.169 --> 00:20:04.937
What I'm saying is look
backwards now.

00:20:04.937 --> 00:20:09.201
What I'm saying is that the
whole components of the output

00:20:09.201 --> 00:20:13.990
Y1 plus Y2 could individually be
derived in the following manner.

00:20:13.990 --> 00:20:18.254
I could get the component Y1 by
simply applying one of the

00:20:18.254 --> 00:20:21.097
voltages and setting the other
to zero.

00:20:21.097 --> 00:20:25.586
I can get the other component
Y2 by setting yet another input

00:20:25.586 --> 00:20:30.000
to zero and applying the voltage
V2 to get Y2.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.735
And sum then up and that's my
answer.

00:20:32.735 --> 00:20:36.229
This will become a lot clearer
with an example.

00:20:36.229 --> 00:20:40.408
Again, remember if I have a
bunch of inputs applied to a

00:20:40.408 --> 00:20:44.739
circuit, V1, V2 and so on,
and I get some output then what

00:20:44.739 --> 00:20:48.841
this is saying is that I can
alternatively find out the

00:20:48.841 --> 00:20:53.248
answer by applying just one
voltage, setting all the others

00:20:53.248 --> 00:20:57.275
to zero, measuring the output,
apply a second voltage,

00:20:57.275 --> 00:21:01.225
set all inputs to zero,
measure the output and sum of

00:21:01.225 --> 00:21:07.000
applesauce and blueberry sauce
and there you get the answer.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:13.058
Let's do an example.
And before we go into that I

00:21:13.058 --> 00:21:20.378
talked about setting voltage
sources and current sources to

00:21:20.378 --> 00:21:22.650
zero.
First of all,

00:21:22.650 --> 00:21:28.834
what does it mean to set a
voltage source to zero?

00:21:28.834 --> 00:21:38.259
This is the same as this.
Setting a voltage source to

00:21:38.259 --> 00:21:49.168
zero is simply replacing the
voltage source with a short,

00:21:49.168 --> 00:22:00.467
and setting a current source to
zero simply implies an open

00:22:00.467 --> 00:22:05.170
circuit.
So when I say zero that source,

00:22:05.170 --> 00:22:09.230
if it's a voltage source short
it, if it's a current source

00:22:09.230 --> 00:22:10.000
open it.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:19.685
I can take any two nodes in the
world and measure the potential

00:22:19.685 --> 00:22:22.835
difference across them.
So there may be some potential

00:22:22.835 --> 00:22:26.520
difference across these set by
the circuit that I haven't shown

00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:29.017
you on this side.
There might be some other

00:22:29.017 --> 00:22:33.000
circuit that is controlling the
voltage of these two nodes.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:38.880
The same with the short.
What's V going to be?

00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:42.409
But there is a V.
It's zero.

00:22:42.409 --> 00:22:48.420
So that's method four,
method of superposition.

00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:56.000
And this method says that the
output of a circuit --

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:06.397
Again, remember I'm focusing on
linear circuits.

00:23:06.397 --> 00:23:10.012
Remember, I have this
playground where LMD applies.

00:23:10.012 --> 00:23:14.421
And within that playground I'm
playing in the south goal area.

00:23:14.421 --> 00:23:17.602
In the south goal area,
in that subset of the

00:23:17.602 --> 00:23:21.433
playground circuits are linear.
So in that part of the

00:23:21.433 --> 00:23:25.626
playground superposition applies
because there circuits are

00:23:25.626 --> 00:23:32.082
linear.
So the output of a circuit is

00:23:32.082 --> 00:23:42.422
determined by summing up the
responses to each source acting

00:23:42.422 --> 00:23:44.000
alone.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:58.200
Now, in this statement here
this source stands for

00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:01.666
independent source.
I haven't talked about

00:24:01.666 --> 00:24:04.393
independent versus dependent
sources.

00:24:04.393 --> 00:24:08.712
We'll talk about dependent
sources a few weeks from today.

00:24:08.712 --> 00:24:12.954
And just so you don't get
confused, for dependent sources

00:24:12.954 --> 00:24:17.424
you will be looking at Section
3.3.3 of your course notes to

00:24:17.424 --> 00:24:21.212
see how superposition works with
dependent sources.

00:24:21.212 --> 00:24:25.227
But remember we haven't covered
dependent sources yet.

00:24:25.227 --> 00:24:30.000
We will be covering them about
two weeks from now.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:36.377
So let's go back to our example
and apply the method of

00:24:36.377 --> 00:24:43.110
superposition to an example.
So the method says sum up the

00:24:43.110 --> 00:24:49.370
outputs of each of the
sub-circuits where I'm applying

00:24:49.370 --> 00:24:55.511
one source acting alone.
So let me just do this here.

00:24:55.511 --> 00:25:03.000
Let me start with the circuit.
And let me start with shutting

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:06.000
I off.
So I have voltage V --

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:16.507
I have R2.
And I'm shutting I off.

00:25:16.507 --> 00:25:21.183
So I have replaced this with an
open circuit.

00:25:21.183 --> 00:25:25.859
So I is zero.
Let me call the node voltage eV

00:25:25.859 --> 00:25:32.555
to reflect that component of the
node voltage that arises due to

00:25:32.555 --> 00:25:37.303
V acting alone.
And you should look at this

00:25:37.303 --> 00:25:42.423
pattern here and very quickly be
able to write the answer for

00:25:42.423 --> 00:25:46.262
patterns like this voltage,
the two resistors.

00:25:46.262 --> 00:25:49.078
That's called a resistive
divider.

00:25:49.078 --> 00:25:52.491
It will appear again and again
and again.

00:25:52.491 --> 00:25:56.672
And eV is simply V times R2
divided by R1 plus R2.

00:25:56.672 --> 00:26:02.449
That's still my ground node.
So the voltage here is simply

00:26:02.449 --> 00:26:07.179
this voltage divided by the two
resistors to give you the

00:26:07.179 --> 00:26:12.416
current multiplied by R2 to give
you the voltage across this R.

00:26:12.416 --> 00:26:16.386
Remember this pattern.
You apply voltage divider

00:26:16.386 --> 00:26:21.370
patterns probably more times
than any other pattern that you

00:26:21.370 --> 00:26:24.833
might imagine.
So that's with the V acting

00:26:24.833 --> 00:26:27.874
alone.
Now, let me do I acting alone.

00:26:27.874 --> 00:26:31.000
So for I acting alone --

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:49.276
And what I do this time around
is replace this with a short,

00:26:49.276 --> 00:26:53.425
replace the voltage source to
the short.

00:26:53.425 --> 00:27:00.127
And let me call this voltage eI
for the component of the voltage

00:27:00.127 --> 00:27:04.726
due to the current I.
And eI, in this case,

00:27:04.726 --> 00:27:08.260
is simply given by yet another
pattern here,

00:27:08.260 --> 00:27:12.452
the current across a pair or
resistors is simply the

00:27:12.452 --> 00:27:17.630
effective resistance multiplied
by the current so it's i and the

00:27:17.630 --> 00:27:21.246
effective resistance is R1,
R2 or R1 plus R2.

00:27:21.246 --> 00:27:24.369
That's eI.
That's a component that node

00:27:24.369 --> 00:27:31.021
due to the current I.
Now, so the method says that.

00:27:31.021 --> 00:27:38.924
Then take these components,
sum them up and there you have

00:27:38.924 --> 00:27:44.054
the answer.
So E is simply ev plus ei.

00:27:44.054 --> 00:27:49.323
The components of V and I
acting alone,

00:27:49.323 --> 00:27:56.533
just simply V times R2 divided
by R1 plus R2 plus R1,

00:27:56.533 --> 00:28:00.000
R2.
There we go.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.793
Fortunately,
the fates have been kind to us

00:28:02.793 --> 00:28:06.784
and the answer is the same as
the answer we obtained with the

00:28:06.784 --> 00:28:08.713
node method.
No surprise here.

00:28:08.713 --> 00:28:11.840
So this is actually an
incredibly simple method.

00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:14.368
So you can take a very complex
circuit.

00:28:14.368 --> 00:28:18.226
What have you really done here?
You can take a very complex

00:28:18.226 --> 00:28:22.350
circuit and you can solve a very
complex circuit by breaking it

00:28:22.350 --> 00:28:25.343
down into many simple individual
sub problems.

00:28:25.343 --> 00:28:30.000
You will do this in EECS time
and time and time again.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:33.228
Whether it's in software
systems or hardware systems or

00:28:33.228 --> 00:28:35.680
what have you,
you're often times building

00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:38.490
complicated systems.
Remember doom on this side?

00:28:38.490 --> 00:28:41.480
And the way and when you put
these things together,

00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:44.828
let's say a large software
system, is you don't write the

00:28:44.828 --> 00:28:47.997
whole piece of software starting
main and grunge down.

00:28:47.997 --> 00:28:50.808
You build a lot of little
components and tie the

00:28:50.808 --> 00:28:53.618
components together.
In the same manner here you

00:28:53.618 --> 00:28:57.146
take a big circuit and you find
its behavior for each source

00:28:57.146 --> 00:29:00.909
acting alone.
Lots of little inky dinky

00:29:00.909 --> 00:29:04.805
simple little circuits.
And you will see examples in

00:29:04.805 --> 00:29:09.618
your homework where you're given
a big circuit or because it set

00:29:09.618 --> 00:29:14.201
all the Is to zero and the other
Vs to zero the whole circuit

00:29:14.201 --> 00:29:18.479
almost vanishes and all that
you're left with is a little

00:29:18.479 --> 00:29:21.229
resistor or two.
So this is the very,

00:29:21.229 --> 00:29:24.590
very powerful method.
I'd like to do a little

00:29:24.590 --> 00:29:28.562
demonstration for you.
And what I'm going to show you

00:29:28.562 --> 00:29:36.301
is the demo is a vat of water.
Actually, I'll tell you what it

00:29:36.301 --> 00:29:42.684
is in a second.
But assume it is salt water for

00:29:42.684 --> 00:29:46.569
now.
I'll apply two voltages.

00:29:46.569 --> 00:29:52.397
In this case I'm going to apply
a sinusoid.

00:29:52.397 --> 00:29:59.057
That's not very good.
A sinusoid and a triangular

00:29:59.057 --> 00:30:03.280
wave.
And what I'm going to do is

00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:06.068
measure the response at this
site.

00:30:06.068 --> 00:30:08.771
Now, this is a vat of salt
water.

00:30:08.771 --> 00:30:13.585
And I'm going to tell you it
behaves like a linear system.

00:30:13.585 --> 00:30:17.555
If you view each little
particle, or each little

00:30:17.555 --> 00:30:22.792
cubic-centimeter or whatever of
water, it'll behave like little

00:30:22.792 --> 00:30:25.664
resistor.
So this vat of salt water

00:30:25.664 --> 00:30:30.141
behaves like big distributed
resistor in the following

00:30:30.141 --> 00:30:32.000
manner.

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:41.854
And so on.
This of this big mesh of little

00:30:41.854 --> 00:30:44.151
resistors, but it's all
resistors.

00:30:44.151 --> 00:30:47.424
It's a linear circuit.
So I'm going to apply two

00:30:47.424 --> 00:30:51.322
voltages, a triangular and a
sinusoid, and we're going to

00:30:51.322 --> 00:30:54.664
observe the output.
And what do you expect to see

00:30:54.664 --> 00:30:57.170
there?
You will see the superposition

00:30:57.170 --> 00:31:01.000
of the two, which is you'll see
a sinusoid.

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:07.478
And then you'll see the jagged
triangular thing articulating

00:31:07.478 --> 00:31:13.188
the sinusoid pattern.
What I'm going to do right now,

00:31:13.188 --> 00:31:18.678
don't put any water yet.
This is the vat of nothing

00:31:18.678 --> 00:31:21.423
right now.
It's all empty.

00:31:21.423 --> 00:31:25.266
Can we show the screen on this
side?

00:31:25.266 --> 00:31:29.000
The oscilloscope screen?

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:35.518
OK.
Oh, there you go.

00:31:35.518 --> 00:31:38.936
So this is the screen of the
oscilloscope now.

00:31:38.936 --> 00:31:43.569
Notice that I have a sinusoid
and I have a triangular wave and

00:31:43.569 --> 00:31:46.987
the output is zero.
And the reason is there is

00:31:46.987 --> 00:31:49.341
nothing in this vat.
It's empty.

00:31:49.341 --> 00:31:53.139
So previously when I taught
this course I would get

00:31:53.139 --> 00:31:57.240
saltwater and pour saltwater.
Then we discovered a much

00:31:57.240 --> 00:32:01.569
better source of water that
conducted electricity like one

00:32:01.569 --> 00:32:05.325
real mean fluid.
Cambridge water.

00:32:05.325 --> 00:32:10.132
It just works very pleasantly.
It just conducts electricity

00:32:10.132 --> 00:32:14.359
like nothing at all.
And I've been thinking of using

00:32:14.359 --> 00:32:18.502
Charles River water next time
and see what happens,

00:32:18.502 --> 00:32:23.226
although there we'd probably
get some biological organisms

00:32:23.226 --> 00:32:26.624
doing strange things at you.
But go ahead.

00:32:26.624 --> 00:32:30.104
Our friendly demonstration
expert, Lorenzo,

00:32:30.104 --> 00:32:34.000
will pour some water into the
vat.

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:39.894
And you should begin seeing the
output being a superposition of

00:32:39.894 --> 00:32:42.080
the two.
So as he pours,

00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:44.838
there you go,
do you see that?

00:32:44.838 --> 00:32:50.542
So you do see the sinusoidal
articulation and the jagged wave

00:32:50.542 --> 00:32:53.964
form.
And just to have some more fun,

00:32:53.964 --> 00:32:58.242
what I can do is increase one
of the voltages.

00:32:58.242 --> 00:33:01.000
And you'll see --

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:10.400
Now you know what would have
happened if I had used Charles

00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:13.510
River water.
So my output keeps increasing

00:33:13.510 --> 00:33:17.000
as I increase the corresponding
wave form.

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.126
I could do this,
this is fun.

00:33:26.126 --> 00:33:30.000
So let me pause there and go
onto the next topic.

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:34.627
So that little demonstration
showed you that even something

00:33:34.627 --> 00:33:39.255
as simple as this physical
entity vat of water behaves like

00:33:39.255 --> 00:33:42.765
a linear system,
and we can model that linear

00:33:42.765 --> 00:33:46.595
system as a set of resistors.
Unbeknownst to you,

00:33:46.595 --> 00:33:50.744
right now, in the past ten
seconds I introduced a new

00:33:50.744 --> 00:33:53.138
concept.
It's called subliminal

00:33:53.138 --> 00:33:56.409
advertising.
So one of the things we do in

00:33:56.409 --> 00:34:02.323
EE a lot is model real systems.
So often times if I wanted to

00:34:02.323 --> 00:34:06.809
look at the behavior of salt,
behavior of a vat of water,

00:34:06.809 --> 00:34:11.295
I can model it as a set of
resistors for certain kinds of

00:34:11.295 --> 00:34:14.660
activities.
Just hold that thought for some

00:34:14.660 --> 00:34:17.624
time later in your careers.
All right.

00:34:17.624 --> 00:34:21.149
That's method four,
the superposition method.

00:34:21.149 --> 00:34:25.715
Remember, it is methods like
this that will make your life

00:34:25.715 --> 00:34:29.000
really, really,
really easy.

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:34.795
If you find that you are having
to do a lot of grunging homework

00:34:34.795 --> 00:34:38.198
or something,
just step back and think

00:34:38.198 --> 00:34:41.602
superposition,
think Thevenin or think

00:34:41.602 --> 00:34:45.649
composition rule.
There must be a simpler way

00:34:45.649 --> 00:34:48.685
usually.
Let's do the next method.

00:34:48.685 --> 00:34:51.813
This is called the Thevenin
method.

00:34:51.813 --> 00:34:57.240
To derive this method let me
start by applying superposition

00:34:57.240 --> 00:35:03.144
to some circuit.
So let's say I have some

00:35:03.144 --> 00:35:09.432
arbitrary network N.
Assume it's a linear network

00:35:09.432 --> 00:35:15.982
and the network has a whole
bunch of goodies in it.

00:35:15.982 --> 00:35:22.925
It has a bunch of resistors,
it has a bunch of voltage

00:35:22.925 --> 00:35:30.000
sources, and it has a bunch of
current sources.

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:33.733
Many current sources.
Many voltage sources.

00:35:33.733 --> 00:35:37.644
Many resistors.
Some jumbled voltage sources,

00:35:37.644 --> 00:35:43.066
current sources and resistors.
And I look at two nodes in this

00:35:43.066 --> 00:35:46.000
network.
Here are two nodes in the

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:50.977
network, two points in the
network were elements connect.

00:35:50.977 --> 00:35:56.044
I'm looking at those two nodes
and all I want to do is the

00:35:56.044 --> 00:36:00.755
following.
I want to figure out if I take

00:36:00.755 --> 00:36:05.716
a rinky-dinky little current
source and apply it there,

00:36:05.716 --> 00:36:10.401
all I want to figure out is
what is V and what is I.

00:36:10.401 --> 00:36:15.729
There is this mongo box out
here, a black box of resistors,

00:36:15.729 --> 00:36:20.598
voltage source and current
sources, too many to count.

00:36:20.598 --> 00:36:24.272
I pick two nodes,
apply a current source,

00:36:24.272 --> 00:36:29.968
and all I care about is what is
the voltage that I will measure

00:36:29.968 --> 00:36:35.788
by applying it here.
Notice the current here will be

00:36:35.788 --> 00:36:40.467
I because the current here is I.
And I apply it here.

00:36:40.467 --> 00:36:43.795
I want to measure what the
voltage is.

00:36:43.795 --> 00:36:48.833
Now, with the insight you've
obtained from superposition,

00:36:48.833 --> 00:36:53.692
you should be able to jump up
and state the form of the

00:36:53.692 --> 00:36:57.110
answer.
So by superposition we know the

00:36:57.110 --> 00:37:01.447
following.
We know that the effect of the

00:37:01.447 --> 00:37:06.342
circuit will be the same as the
sum of components being added

00:37:06.342 --> 00:37:07.973
up.
Sum of component,

00:37:07.973 --> 00:37:11.889
sum of component,
a bunch of components added up.

00:37:11.889 --> 00:37:16.376
Each component will be the
response of one source acting

00:37:16.376 --> 00:37:18.986
alone.
So if I can figure out the

00:37:18.986 --> 00:37:23.555
effect of one source acting
alone and put that down here,

00:37:23.555 --> 00:37:28.449
and do the same thing for all
the sources, that's what I will

00:37:28.449 --> 00:37:32.171
get.
So for the source Vm it's a

00:37:32.171 --> 00:37:35.549
linear circuit.
So I know that my answer is

00:37:35.549 --> 00:37:40.375
going to be, in the final answer
is going to be a Vm term and

00:37:40.375 --> 00:37:44.235
it's going to be multiplied by
some alpha M term.

00:37:44.235 --> 00:37:47.694
I know that.
It's a linear circuit so I know

00:37:47.694 --> 00:37:52.037
that the answer shall have a
term Vm multiplied by some

00:37:52.037 --> 00:37:54.369
constant.
Simple, I know that.

00:37:54.369 --> 00:38:00.000
Similarly, the same is true
for, oh, this is the term Vm.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:05.618
And what I can do is I can
measure just this effect by

00:38:05.618 --> 00:38:09.540
setting all the other sources to
zero.

00:38:09.540 --> 00:38:15.583
So I can set all the other
current sources to zero and all

00:38:15.583 --> 00:38:19.399
voltage sources,
except for this one,

00:38:19.399 --> 00:38:23.639
and I can get that answer.
So, similarly,

00:38:23.639 --> 00:38:30.000
for every voltage source I am
going to get a term.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:34.142
So for every single voltage
source, M1, M2,

00:38:34.142 --> 00:38:39.665
M3 and so on I'm going to get
such a term and they're all

00:38:39.665 --> 00:38:44.104
going to sum up.
Similarly, I'm going to get a

00:38:44.104 --> 00:38:48.246
term for In.
And I know there will be an In

00:38:48.246 --> 00:38:53.276
term, and I know it's going to
be some constant beta

00:38:53.276 --> 00:38:57.616
multiplying In.
In this example of ours here,

00:38:57.616 --> 00:39:01.857
in this example,
remember alpha was this and

00:39:01.857 --> 00:39:08.114
beta was this constant here.
There's some constant beta,

00:39:08.114 --> 00:39:11.716
some constant alpha.
And because I have a whole

00:39:11.716 --> 00:39:16.728
bunch of current sources there's
going to be such a term for each

00:39:16.728 --> 00:39:19.861
one of them.
And each one of these terms,

00:39:19.861 --> 00:39:24.481
Vm, In will be the voltage I
would see here if I set all the

00:39:24.481 --> 00:39:28.945
other Vms to zero and I set all
the other current sources,

00:39:28.945 --> 00:39:33.762
except for that one to zero.
What am I missing?

00:39:33.762 --> 00:39:36.601
Is that it?
The response here,

00:39:36.601 --> 00:39:39.930
V here.
Am I missing anything here?

00:39:39.930 --> 00:39:43.748
Is that it?
Now, don't all yell at once.

00:39:43.748 --> 00:39:47.174
What am I missing?
Current source i,

00:39:47.174 --> 00:39:50.993
exactly.
So if I have a current source i

00:39:50.993 --> 00:39:55.496
then there's an effect of this
current as well.

00:39:55.496 --> 00:40:00.000
And so I write down i there,
too.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:03.410
It's going to be some constant
multiplying I.

00:40:03.410 --> 00:40:07.286
And that constant is going to
look like a resistor,

00:40:07.286 --> 00:40:11.317
right, because this circuit
contains current sources,

00:40:11.317 --> 00:40:15.968
voltage sources and resistors.
If I've shorted all my voltage

00:40:15.968 --> 00:40:19.147
sources and opened all my
current sources,

00:40:19.147 --> 00:40:22.945
what's left in here?
Just a whole caboodle full of

00:40:22.945 --> 00:40:25.348
Rs.
It's just going to look like

00:40:25.348 --> 00:40:30.000
some resistance R.
And that's what I get here.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:35.699
So this is what V is going to
look like and that's a form.

00:40:35.699 --> 00:40:40.000
So let's take a look at these
components.

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:47.465
Let's focus on the easy part
first.

00:40:47.465 --> 00:40:51.526
What does this look like?
This component looks like an I,

00:40:51.526 --> 00:40:54.935
it looks like a current and has
some resistance.

00:40:54.935 --> 00:40:57.255
What is that resistance given
by?

00:40:57.255 --> 00:41:01.389
Supposing I gave you this
network and this currency source

00:41:01.389 --> 00:41:05.908
and I asked you tell me R.
How would you measure R?

00:41:05.908 --> 00:41:09.804
What you would do is open all
the current sources,

00:41:09.804 --> 00:41:14.336
short all the voltage sources,
put a ohmmeter in there and

00:41:14.336 --> 00:41:17.039
measure the resistance R.
That's R.

00:41:17.039 --> 00:41:21.571
OK, so we understand this term.
What about this term here?

00:41:21.571 --> 00:41:25.308
Can someone tell me the units
of this term here,

00:41:25.308 --> 00:41:27.535
this big thing here?
Voltage.

00:41:27.535 --> 00:41:32.134
This is a voltage.
This is a voltage.

00:41:32.134 --> 00:41:37.114
iR is a voltage.
So this does behave like a

00:41:37.114 --> 00:41:40.909
voltage.
And it behaves like some

00:41:40.909 --> 00:41:45.533
voltage V.
So notice that as far as this

00:41:45.533 --> 00:41:52.529
current I is concerned the rest
of the universe looks like a

00:41:52.529 --> 00:42:00.000
resistor and a voltage source
behaving in some manner.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:04.347
And let me just call it Vth for
now, and you'll know why in a

00:42:04.347 --> 00:42:05.000
second.

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:26.000
The voltage has a form,
some voltage plus Ri.

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:32.280
So, in other words,
as far as this I is concerned

00:42:32.280 --> 00:42:39.345
this whole network here N full
of all the nice stuff is

00:42:39.345 --> 00:42:43.532
indistinguishable to this I
here.

00:42:43.532 --> 00:42:50.859
So my I is sitting out there
injecting a current into two

00:42:50.859 --> 00:42:55.700
nodes.
If I am i, I'm looking at this,

00:42:55.700 --> 00:43:03.813
this network looks no different
than a voltage source in series

00:43:03.813 --> 00:43:11.408
with the resistor R.
Notice that the equation for

00:43:11.408 --> 00:43:18.226
this simple circuit is this,
so I is given by V minus Vth

00:43:18.226 --> 00:43:22.000
divided by R.
Just remember.

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:32.705
It's a circuit.
In other words,

00:43:32.705 --> 00:43:37.485
Agarwal sitting here cannot
tell the difference if I'm

00:43:37.485 --> 00:43:42.355
measuring the voltage here
between a circuit that looks

00:43:42.355 --> 00:43:47.405
like a Vth in series to the
resistor or this huge mess of

00:43:47.405 --> 00:43:51.464
voltage sources and current
sources and so on.

00:43:51.464 --> 00:43:54.440
Now, we will talk about Vth and
R.

00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:59.580
R is called the resistance of
the network as seen from the

00:43:59.580 --> 00:44:04.000
port with all the sources shut
off.

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:06.568
And similarly Vth,
what is Vth?

00:44:06.568 --> 00:44:09.222
Vth is the open circuit
voltage.

00:44:09.222 --> 00:44:12.818
In other words,
if I apply the voltage here

00:44:12.818 --> 00:44:17.784
this is the response of all the
current sources and all the

00:44:17.784 --> 00:44:23.006
voltage sources acting together.
So it's as if I took this out

00:44:23.006 --> 00:44:27.287
and simply measured my V here as
if I didn't exist,

00:44:27.287 --> 00:44:31.854
correct?
Because this is the component

00:44:31.854 --> 00:44:35.202
of i.
So if I opened i and measured

00:44:35.202 --> 00:44:40.124
V, I would get that big term on
the left-hand side.

00:44:40.124 --> 00:44:43.963
That's my Vth.
So that inspires the next

00:44:43.963 --> 00:44:48.000
method called the Thevenin
method.

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:04.122
In this method what I'm going
to do is take some circuit,

00:45:04.122 --> 00:45:07.948
I'm on Page 9,
with a mess of stuff.

00:45:07.948 --> 00:45:13.742
It's a big mess of stuff.
And if I care to look at its

00:45:13.742 --> 00:45:20.630
impact on something else that I
add from the outside then as far

00:45:20.630 --> 00:45:25.003
as the outside world is
concerned this is

00:45:25.003 --> 00:45:32.000
indistinguishable from a circuit
that looks like this.

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:49.464
So what I can do is if I want
to figure out what's happening

00:45:49.464 --> 00:45:54.081
here then, for the purpose of my
analysis, this simple network

00:45:54.081 --> 00:45:59.000
here with R and Vth becomes a
surrogate for this entire mess.

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:03.547
So for the purpose of finding
out the behavior at this point,

00:46:03.547 --> 00:46:07.867
I can take this huge mess and
replace it with its Thevenin

00:46:07.867 --> 00:46:10.293
surrogate or Thevenin
equivalent.

00:46:10.293 --> 00:46:14.689
This is called the Thevenin
equivalent of this big network.

00:46:14.689 --> 00:46:18.933
Let me do an example that will
make the method completely

00:46:18.933 --> 00:46:21.207
clear.
Again, remember in EECS,

00:46:21.207 --> 00:46:25.907
most of our lives are about how
can we make things so simple as

00:46:25.907 --> 00:46:30.000
being able to be analyzed by
inspection?

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:36.563
And so this is a method that
takes you further down that

00:46:36.563 --> 00:46:40.740
path.
So let me use the same circuit

00:46:40.740 --> 00:46:45.633
that I've been using before,
my voltage V,

00:46:45.633 --> 00:46:48.020
R1, R2.
This is an R.

00:46:48.020 --> 00:46:55.181
I'm 55 minutes fast so we have
another three or four minutes.

00:46:55.181 --> 00:47:01.500
So this is my circuit.
And let's say all I care about

00:47:01.500 --> 00:47:05.000
is finding out i1.
That's all I care about.

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:10.166
And what I'm going to do is I'm
going to box this up and see if

00:47:10.166 --> 00:47:14.083
I can replace that with its
Thevenin equivalent.

00:47:14.083 --> 00:47:17.000
So I'm going to box that up.

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:39.604
What I'm saying is that I'm
going to box it up and replace

00:47:39.604 --> 00:47:42.189
it with this Thevenin
equivalent.

00:47:42.189 --> 00:47:45.824
I don't know what Vth and R are
at this point.

00:47:45.824 --> 00:47:48.328
I'm just calling it Rth for
fun.

00:47:48.328 --> 00:47:52.933
I don't know what these two
values are, but if I knew what

00:47:52.933 --> 00:47:57.618
these two values were I can
determine I really trivially as

00:47:57.618 --> 00:48:00.688
follows.
I can get i1 as simply V minus

00:48:00.688 --> 00:48:06.659
Vth divided by R1 plus Rth.
So if I knew Vth and Rth,

00:48:06.659 --> 00:48:11.765
I can write down i1 by
inspection in that manner.

00:48:11.765 --> 00:48:16.234
So next, finally,
how do I get Vth and Rth?

00:48:16.234 --> 00:48:22.829
You get Rth by looking at this
network and shutting off all the

00:48:22.829 --> 00:48:29.000
voltage sources and measuring
the resistance there.

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:36.350
So I short my voltage source,
that's R1.

00:48:36.350 --> 00:48:43.890
Oops, wrong way.
I need to look this way.

00:48:43.890 --> 00:48:51.052
So looking this way,
that's what I get.

00:48:51.052 --> 00:48:56.895
So what's Rth?
Rth is simply R2.

00:48:56.895 --> 00:49:05.000
So I have opened my current
source.

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:09.241
Similarly, for Vth,
remember all I want to do is

00:49:09.241 --> 00:49:13.574
look at the two nodes,
step back, put a voltmeter

00:49:13.574 --> 00:49:18.808
there, measure the voltage,
that's my open circuit voltage.

00:49:18.808 --> 00:49:24.043
So the way I do it is I take
the circuit and simply measure

00:49:24.043 --> 00:49:26.570
the voltage there.
That's R2.

00:49:26.570 --> 00:49:32.980
That's my current capital I.
And I simply want to measure

00:49:32.980 --> 00:49:37.663
the open circuit voltage here,
which is what?

00:49:37.663 --> 00:49:44.156
Just simply if I stand back and
I kind of gingerly measure the

00:49:44.156 --> 00:49:50.330
voltage here without disturbing
anything, I simply get IR2.

00:49:50.330 --> 00:49:56.504
So Vth is IR2 and Rth is R2 and
here is the formula for the

00:49:56.504 --> 00:50:02.571
current in this branch when I
apply a voltage source and a

00:50:02.571 --> 00:50:08.000
resistor R1 to this little
circuit here.

00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:12.189
OK, let's pause and let me
summarize this in about ten

00:50:12.189 --> 00:50:14.718
seconds.
I had this circuit here.

00:50:14.718 --> 00:50:18.907
I wanted to find out i1.
So what I said I'd do is take

00:50:18.907 --> 00:50:22.859
this complicated mess,
well, it's not a complicated

00:50:22.859 --> 00:50:26.257
mess but assume it is,
and replace with it a

00:50:26.257 --> 00:50:31.000
resistance Rth got by turning
off all the sources.

00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:35.067
And the voltage in series,
Vth, which I get simply by

00:50:35.067 --> 00:50:38.117
pulling this thing out,
taking my input,

00:50:38.117 --> 00:50:42.028
this part out and simply
measuring the open circuit

00:50:42.028 --> 00:50:43.749
voltage out there,
Vth.

00:50:43.749 --> 00:50:48.286
And then I replaced the whole
network with this new network

00:50:48.286 --> 00:50:51.884
that they call the Thevenin
network, and voila,

00:50:51.884 --> 00:50:53.817
I get the answer in a second.
