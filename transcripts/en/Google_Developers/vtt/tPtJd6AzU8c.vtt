&gt;&gt;&gt; Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome back

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:08.400
Vic Gundotra.

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:14.599
[ Cheers and applause ]
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: Wow!

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:17.710
Good morning, everybody.

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:20.020
This place is packed.

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:24.050
I'm surprised so many of you made it back
after that great party last night.

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:29.349
You know, let me begin by just thanking you
guys for your support.

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:32.300
Yesterday was an epic day for Google I/O.

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.870
It was quite an amazing day.

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:36.390
And just thank you for being part of that.

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.000
I hope you enjoyed it as much as we did.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.420
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: And I hope you're enjoying

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:46.499
your Android development kits.

00:00:46.499 --> 00:00:47.499
Yes?

00:00:47.499 --> 00:00:51.629
[ Cheers and applause ]
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: All right.

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.699
You know, that party last night, thank you
for many of you who downloaded the new version

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.399
of Google+ for Android and then accepted my
invitation.

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:03.019
We had over 2600 of you do that.

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:09.280
And of those 2600 people, over 1,000 people
turned on Party Mode and contributed over

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.490
13,700 photographs from last night's concert.

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:21.820
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: When was the last time you

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:29.979
went to an event and the next day had that
many photos automatically organized and chronological.

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:31.380
I have to apologize.

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.219
This is not Glass that's distracting me.

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:37.530
Ever since yesterday, I've developed just
this nervous TIC.

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.399
I am just always wondering, where is Sergey?

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:46.259
I'm not sure if he's in the building, if he's
above the building.

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.789
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: As you probably know, he's

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:50.619
going to do some fun stuff again today.

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:53.799
I hope you've been following his Google+ posts.

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:58.290
But I think you're likely to see some pretty
exciting stuff.

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.450
With that, let's get started with day two
keynote.

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.780
I think you're going to be really excited
about what you're going to see here.

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.360
That's going to be handled by our senior vice
president of Chrome and apps, and my friend,

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.210
Sundar Pichai.

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:13.980
Sundar.

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:21.050

[ Music ]
&gt;&gt;Sundar Pichai: Thank you.

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.560
Welcome to day two of Google I/O keynote.

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.140
It's very exciting to be here.

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.390
None of what I have planned involved jumping
from an airplane, doing anything on top of

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.390
Moscone or riding onto the stage.

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.690
But we nevertheless have lots of exciting
stuff ahead.

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.640
In fact, we've had a few exciting months.

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.959
But a few months ago, we launched Chrome for
Android, which, hopefully, all of you can

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:55.469
use on your brand-new Nexus 7.

00:02:55.469 --> 00:03:00.790
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Sundar Pichai: About ten weeks ago, we launched

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:02.260
Google Drive.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.569
And just about three weeks ago, we launched
a whole new next-generation line of Samsung

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:07.580
Chromebooks.

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.159
And we are just getting started.

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:12.950
What we thought we'd do today was to take
a step back, talk to you about the journey

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:15.810
we are on and where we are going next.

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:20.680
I'm primarily going to be talking about Chrome
and our cloud applications, our journey to

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.209
help you all live online in the cloud seamlessly.

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:29.909
We'll also talk about the Web platform, what
we are doing so that developers like you can

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:31.590
write great Web applications.

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.019
So let's get started.

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:39.370
The chart behind me shows the growth of the
World Wide Web, shows the growth of traffic,

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.020
the Internet traffic.

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:43.750
And as you can see is the top line is the
total traffic.

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:45.320
It's exploded.

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:51.030
In fact, since the advent of broadband, it's
grown a lot and reached today over 2.3 billion

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:52.970
users, a staggering number.

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:57.890
But the good news is, this is only one-third
of the world's population.

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:01.519
And the way we are going to get to the rest
of the world is through mobile.

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:03.459
That's what the second line shows.

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:09.219
With the advent of smartphones and better
connectivity, increasingly, people are accessing

00:04:09.219 --> 00:04:12.549
the Web for the first time ever on their phones.

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:16.870
And with the help of mobile, we are going
to reach the entire world's population.

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:21.620
In fact, it's expected in about four years
there are going to be around 20 billion network

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:26.110
connections, about 2.5 network connections
for every user in the world.

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:28.650
We are in the middle of a revolution.

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:32.900
At Google, we saw this trend coming, which
is why we built Chrome.

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:40.419
About three and a half years ago, we launched
Chrome as a browser to help showcase the modern

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:41.610
Web.

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:44.220
And we are very excited and humbled to see
that option.

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:49.680
Thanks to a lot of users and developers like
you, about two years ago at Google I/O, we

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.020
announced that we have 70 million weekly active
users.

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:58.390
A year ago, we announced we had doubled to
160 million active users.

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:04.719
And as of today, we have almost doubled again,
to 310 million active users.

00:05:04.719 --> 00:05:12.530
[ Cheers and applause ]
&gt;&gt;Sundar Pichai: What matters, though, is

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:14.110
that how people use Chrome.

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:16.370
They live on it every day.

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:19.729
Every single day, there are over 60 billion
words typed in Chrome.

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:26.180
That is the equivalent of 100,000 textbooks,
or one terrabyte of data, documents, text,

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:29.419
images, videos are downloaded every single
day.

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:34.550
And, finally, something which is near and
dear to my heart, Chrome is all about speed.

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:39.240
Just one feature in Chrome, the fact that
when you're typing in the Omnibox, we try

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:42.440
to guess where you go, prefetch and prerender
the page.

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:48.169
That feature alone saves 13 years of human
lifetime every single day in Chrome.

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:50.240
[ Cheers and applause ]
&gt;&gt;Sundar Pichai: And we have hundreds of such

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:51.860
features in the product.

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:53.760
We are very humbled by this momentum.

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:57.090
There's a lot of conversation about share,
et cetera.

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:01.900
By our internal metrics and everything we
see out there, Chrome is the most popular

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:03.900
browser in the world globally.

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:07.740
[ Applause ]
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:13.580
&gt;&gt;Sundar Pichai: The landscape has changed
pretty significantly since we launched Chrome.

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:18.880
At the time we launched Chrome, most of you
were using the browser on a single computer.

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:21.569
It was primarily the desktop Web.

00:06:21.569 --> 00:06:23.120
Fast forward to today.

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.630
Almost all of you have smartphones.

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:29.910
You have a computer at home, at work, you
share your devices with family and friends,

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:31.560
and increasingly, you're buying tablets.

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:34.610
So Chrome was built for a better Web.

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:40.130
But for today's Web, we want to make sure
Chrome acts as a layer so that your Web is

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:45.759
personalized, works consistent and seamlessly
across all your devices.

00:06:45.759 --> 00:06:50.310
To show you how we are doing that, let me
invite Brian Rakowski, our vice president

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:57.180
of product management, but more formally known
as the inventor of Incognito mode.

00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:59.979
Brian.

00:06:59.979 --> 00:07:13.990
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Brian Rakowski: Thanks, Sundar.

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:17.610
If you guys are anything like me, you probably
use Chrome across a lot of different computers.

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:22.830
In fact, you probably just use a lot of different
computers, computers, devices, phones, tablets,

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:25.400
all sorts of different things.

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:26.400
I counted.

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:29.009
I use about eight different computers on a
regular basis.

00:07:29.009 --> 00:07:32.130
And I'm sure a lot of you use many more than
that.

00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:36.400
So to show you how Chrome makes that experience
painless moving across all these different

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:40.479
devices to get stuff done, living life in
the cloud, I'm going to show you what I do

00:07:40.479 --> 00:07:43.599
on just a typical day with Chrome.

00:07:43.599 --> 00:07:47.230
Here I am at home on my MacBook.

00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:49.970
Over breakfast, I'm reading news, catching
up on current events.

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:52.509
You see I have a whole bunch of tabs open
here.

00:07:52.509 --> 00:07:53.810
Some of them I've read.

00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:55.450
Some of them I haven't read yet.

00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:59.970
You can see I've got my books marks here,
Chrome has been customized over the last several

00:07:59.970 --> 00:08:04.900
years of using Chrome to have all my settings,
everything that makes Chrome work well for

00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:07.560
me.

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:09.020
But I'm running out of time.

00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:10.640
I've got to get out to work.

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:14.759
I run out the door, leave my Macbook, and
head to work.

00:08:14.759 --> 00:08:18.509
Now I'm at work.

00:08:18.509 --> 00:08:20.710
Not too bad of a commute today.

00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:24.020
Here I am on my Chromebook, and it turns out
I use a different computer at work than I

00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:25.020
do at home.

00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:27.720
In fact, I use a lot of different computers
at work.

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:30.419
As a member of the Chrome team, we're always
testing new hardware.

00:08:30.419 --> 00:08:35.240
We're always trying out new devices, reinstalling
Chrome, Chrome OS on different things.

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:38.820
So I end up using lots of different computers
every day to get stuff done.

00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:41.920
It turns out on this computer, I've never
actually signed up.

00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:44.120
I don't have an account on this computer.

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:50.290
So because I've never used it before, I'll
just sign in with my user name and password.

00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:56.490
If I got that right, all my settings will
start coming down from the cloud.

00:08:56.490 --> 00:08:58.850
These are all my settings on the Macbook.

00:08:58.850 --> 00:09:03.850
And in addition, I've customized Chrome to
start up with some work tabs when I'm at work.

00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:10.300
So when I hit "okay," you should see my work
tabs just appear on the screen.

00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:12.630
There they are.

00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:18.440
[ Cheers and applause ]
&gt;&gt;Brian Rakowski: So you can see, I've got

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:22.250
my bookmarks here, all my settings are down
here, also these tabs, I can get some work

00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:24.230
done, see the tree is open.

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:25.230
That's good.

00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:28.170
PRD I've been working on for incognito.

00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:31.060
I can file some bugs.

00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:32.810
All this work is kind of making me hungry.

00:09:32.810 --> 00:09:35.270
It's time for lunch.

00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:37.150
Let's think about what to have.

00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:44.040
I feel like something salty, maybe a little
bit more of a hearty meal, some pork maybe.

00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:47.210
I heard about this place, but I can't remember
the name.

00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:48.700
Something to do with -- with pig.

00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:50.190
Let me try to query.

00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:51.850
Let's see what happens.

00:09:51.850 --> 00:09:53.030
Salty pig parts.

00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:54.990
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Brian Rakowski: Boccalone.

00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:55.990
Okay.

00:09:55.990 --> 00:09:58.210
That sounds like it might be the place.

00:09:58.210 --> 00:09:59.590
Let me click.

00:09:59.590 --> 00:10:00.590
Yes.

00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:01.590
That's --
[ Applause ]

00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:03.780
&gt;&gt;Brian Rakowski: -- that's what I'm looking
for.

00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:04.780
Okay.

00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:07.280
And it looks like there's a location in the
Ferry Building.

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:08.280
So let me click that.

00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:09.280
Okay.

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:10.280
Not too far.

00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:11.280
I can just walk there.

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:17.480
So leave work, head out the door, and as I
walk to the Ferry Building, I realize that

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:23.480
I was so distracted by those pictures of delicious,
delicious pork products that I forgot exactly

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:25.080
where the location of the place was.

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:27.660
In fact, I wasn't paying attention to it at
all.

00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:31.950
But it's not a problem, because I've got Chrome
installed on my phone, and I'm signed in here,

00:10:31.950 --> 00:10:32.950
too.

00:10:32.950 --> 00:10:35.980
So I'll just -- let me zoom in a little bit.

00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:43.530
I'll just launch Chrome, open a new tab, and
you can see all my recent devices.

00:10:43.530 --> 00:10:46.320
You can see the Chromebook I had open at work.

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:47.730
And that tab is still open there.

00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:48.750
I can pull it over here.

00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:50.560
So I'll click the Ferry Building.

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:55.150
And that page should load right here so I
can see exactly where I need to go.

00:10:55.150 --> 00:11:03.380
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Brian Rakowski: Now, turns out we didn't

00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:04.850
just sync that URL.

00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:07.130
We also made sure that the back button works
across pages.

00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:11.490
So after I've gotten in line, I can start
to look at the menu by tapping back.

00:11:11.490 --> 00:11:12.730
And I can even go back to search results.

00:11:12.730 --> 00:11:17.640
So back works across devices as well.

00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:24.040
[ Cheers and applause ]
&gt;&gt;Brian Rakowski: So now that I'm happily

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:26.640
eating my lunch, turns out I'm a little bit
of a nerd.

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:29.250
I carry a second device around with me.

00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:31.990
When I want a bigger screen, I've got my brand-new
Nexus 7.

00:11:31.990 --> 00:11:34.830
And, of course, Chrome is installed there,
too.

00:11:34.830 --> 00:11:39.870
I've already signed in and started to set
it up.

00:11:39.870 --> 00:11:45.050
Just -- and since I'm having this delicious
sandwich, let's say I want to visit a site,

00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:46.960
it's a blog I haven't been to in a while.

00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:52.630
I think it's called hamburger -- it showcases
the best hamburgers every single day that

00:11:52.630 --> 00:11:53.630
they can find.

00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:57.580
So I'll just start typing -- and because Chrome
is synced, even though I've never typed this

00:11:57.580 --> 00:12:01.610
URL on this device before, I typed it on one
of my other computers, it's synced here, saves

00:12:01.610 --> 00:12:02.790
me a lot of typing.

00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:06.080
And even better, as Sundar mentioned, we're
pretty obsessed with speed.

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:11.460
We've started to load this page in the background
because we know you're very likely to go there.

00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:14.350
As soon as I tap this, it should be there
waiting.

00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:16.260
Ready, one, two, three.

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:20.570
And the page is already loaded.

00:12:20.570 --> 00:12:27.350
[ Cheers and applause ]
&gt;&gt;Brian Rakowski: So I can load a page there,

00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:29.710
enjoy my lunch.

00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:32.400
Everything will be delicious.

00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:38.500
So I've shown you Chrome syncing across a
couple different laptops, including a Chromebook,

00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:44.560
a phone, a tablet, all my settings, including
my open tabs, my bookmarks, all the things

00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:49.280
that make Chrome work for me, synchronizing
silently in the background, making it painless

00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:52.800
to live across all these different devices.

00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:57.700
But there's one more thing I wanted to talk
to you about.

00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:02.440
Some of you have been very persistently asking
for one thing in particular.

00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:07.020
And before we agreed to do it, we wanted to
make sure that we did an excellent job of

00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:08.020
it.

00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:12.170
I'm very happy to say that the team has really
pulled something great out.

00:13:12.170 --> 00:13:16.010
So you're probably wondering what it is I'm
talking about.

00:13:16.010 --> 00:13:21.840
People have been asking -- you've been asking
-- to use Chrome on your iPhone.

00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:31.340
[ Cheers and applause ]
&gt;&gt;Brian Rakowski: So I'm happy to announce

00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:35.290
that later today, Chrome will be rolling out
in the Appstore.

00:13:35.290 --> 00:13:38.170
But I'll give you a sneak preview now.

00:13:38.170 --> 00:13:39.850
Here's Chrome on my home screen.

00:13:39.850 --> 00:13:44.540
Launch it, and it should look very familiar
to any of you who have used Chrome on another

00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:45.540
device before.

00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:49.310
If you use Chrome on Android or a Chromebook,
you'll see it's got an Omnibox up top.

00:13:49.310 --> 00:13:52.070
It behaves just like you'd expect it to.

00:13:52.070 --> 00:13:55.700
You can open tabs, as many tabs as you like.

00:13:55.700 --> 00:13:57.940
You can flick through them easily, quickly.

00:13:57.940 --> 00:14:00.160
It's a silky smooth experience, really fun.

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:03.020
You can select the one you're looking for.

00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:06.740
You can even close tabs with a quick swipe.

00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:09.930

&gt;&gt;Brian Rakowski: And if --

00:14:09.930 --> 00:14:17.250
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Brian Rakowski: And you can even swap tabs

00:14:17.250 --> 00:14:19.620
without having to go to the switcher just
by dragging from the side.

&gt;&gt;Brian Rakowski: Makes browsing the Web on

00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:21.620

00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:22.620
But while we were at it, we figured, why stop
there?

00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:23.620
We might as well go for the iPad, too.

00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:24.620
So --
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:25.620
&gt;&gt;Brian Rakowski: And you can even swap tabs
without having to go to the switcher, just

00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:26.620
by dragging from the side.

We might as well go for the iPad, too.

00:14:33.730 --> 00:14:40.350
[ Cheers and Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Brian Rakowski: So I'll give you a sneak

00:14:40.350 --> 00:14:41.640
preview of that as well.

00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:45.860
Here is Chrome on the home screen of my iPad.

00:14:45.860 --> 00:14:46.860
Launch it.

00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:49.620
You can see we've put the tabs up top here
just like we did on the Nexus 7.

00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:52.740
We've got a little more space to work with
that makes multi-tasking easier.

00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:55.980
I've got a bunch of tabs open here and you
can see they've started to pile up because

00:14:55.980 --> 00:14:57.800
I've got a few too many open.

00:14:57.800 --> 00:14:58.800
That's not unusual.

00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:01.610
But I can just push them out of the way to
get to the one I'm looking for.

00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:07.230
It's a really nice overflow solution when
you have a lot of tabs open.

00:15:07.230 --> 00:15:10.460
And just like all the other devices, it's
synced.

00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:11.460
Everything is here.

00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:16.590
So you can see I have my bookmarks from my
desktop, find anything I'm looking for, and

00:15:16.590 --> 00:15:18.040
all my other devices are here.

00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:20.280
So you can see everything I've done today.

00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:26.880
You can see I've got all those restaurant
pages open on my iPhone, you can see my Nexus

00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:30.660
7 where I was looking at food over my lunch,
you can see the salty pig parts query which

00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:37.050
I backed up from on the Boccalone site, the
work that I did today -- looks like I didn't

00:15:37.050 --> 00:15:39.520
do much at all.

00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:43.290
And you can see the pages I had open on my
MacBook Pro this morning over breakfast.

00:15:43.290 --> 00:15:49.200
In case I want pick up where I left off on
one of those pages, I'll just tap it and finish

00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:52.490
reading the news and it will load here.

00:15:52.490 --> 00:15:55.610
Everything just works across devices.

00:15:55.610 --> 00:15:59.180
But in this case -- oh, it looks like I need
to log in.

00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:00.510
Well, it's not a problem.

00:16:00.510 --> 00:16:02.300
My credentials are linked across machines.

00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:05.410
Even though I've never used the "New York
Times" on this device before, never logged

00:16:05.410 --> 00:16:11.280
in, I can just tap "log in," and because I'm
signed in, my credentials are synced, auto

00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:16.200
fill, you can log in directly.

00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:23.930
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Brian Rakowski: Now, one more feature before

00:16:23.930 --> 00:16:31.640
I quit, Incognito, a feature near and dear
to my heart, the team did a great job with

00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:32.640
Incognito here.

00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:34.730
You can see it works just how you would expect
it to from other computers.

00:16:34.730 --> 00:16:38.960
You can toggle between regular and Incognito
windows just by tapping there.

00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:44.290
And having Incognito on a touch device is
a great experience.

00:16:44.290 --> 00:16:45.470
Thank you.

00:16:45.470 --> 00:16:48.190
Sundar, back to you.

00:16:48.190 --> 00:16:56.830
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Sundar Pichai: Thank you, Brian.

00:16:56.830 --> 00:17:03.450
It's an exciting demo to see Chrome on Android
phones, Android tablets and now on the iPhone

00:17:03.450 --> 00:17:04.760
and the iPad.

00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:10.120
So no matter which device you're using, we're
working really hard across all important software

00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:11.120
platforms.

00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:12.650
No other browser vendor is doing this.

00:17:12.650 --> 00:17:18.310
We want to make sure it's about the user,
your Web, working everywhere, personalized,

00:17:18.310 --> 00:17:22.410
consistent, always, any time, anywhere.

00:17:22.410 --> 00:17:29.230
Of course, when you're living online and living
in the cloud, you're using cloud applications.

00:17:29.230 --> 00:17:34.680
And at Google we realized this, and in 2004
there was a profound shift on the Web.

00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:40.940
The Web shifted from documents to be about
rich, interactive Web applications.

00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:47.290
And in 2004 we launched one of the seminal
AJAX applications of that era, Gmail.

00:17:47.290 --> 00:17:54.750
And since then Gmail has grown to reach 425
million active users, monthly unique users,

00:17:54.750 --> 00:17:58.240
and it's become a primary communications platform
for all these users.

00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:00.000
We haven't stopped there.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:05.490
We've been very hard at work and we've continually
added more applications.

00:18:05.490 --> 00:18:10.910
Google Calendar, Google Documents, Google
Spreadsheets, Google Presentations, and about

00:18:10.910 --> 00:18:16.480
ten weeks ago we launched Google Drive, a
centralized place for you to create and collaborate

00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:21.650
online and have all your important data with
you so that you can live in the cloud.

00:18:21.650 --> 00:18:27.530
We call this Going Google, and hundreds of
millions of users have gone Google.

00:18:27.530 --> 00:18:29.320
But it's not just at home.

00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:32.380
There is a very powerful trend underway.

00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:34.500
We call this consumerization of businesses.

00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:42.760
It's the same person who leaves home and shows
up at work, and they demand the same experience.

00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:44.390
Smartphones are a good example.

00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:48.630
People have demanded the same smartphones
at work like they've used at home.

00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:51.750
The same is true for their applications as
well.

00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:57.980
This trend has been so powerful, we are seeing
many, many businesses are Going Google.

00:18:57.980 --> 00:19:05.060
In fact, governmental agencies in 45 out of
50 states in the U.S., including places like

00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:08.320
Department of Interior, have gone Google.

00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:13.660
66 of top 100 universities in the United States
have gone Google.

00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:18.690
And over five million businesses, the rate
at which we are signing up businesses is growing

00:19:18.690 --> 00:19:20.930
steadily, have gone Google.

00:19:20.930 --> 00:19:23.230
This is a pretty fundamental shift.

00:19:23.230 --> 00:19:26.920
If you look at most businesses, they are based
on the PC architecture.

00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:32.540
And the PC, which was a huge revolution, was
primarily focused on automating your individual

00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:34.410
work space.

00:19:34.410 --> 00:19:37.750
Fast forward to today.

00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:43.870
Most companies are in -- care about collaboration
deeply, and you're just not going to get there

00:19:43.870 --> 00:19:46.910
by using SharePoint or TPS reports.

00:19:46.910 --> 00:19:53.120
What you need is a radical different architecture
to get there, which is why many, many large

00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:55.130
companies are Going Google.

00:19:55.130 --> 00:19:56.590
You can see many big names up there.

00:19:56.590 --> 00:19:58.250
Let me give you one example.

00:19:58.250 --> 00:20:02.490
Roche, which has 90,000 employees over 140
countries.

00:20:02.490 --> 00:20:06.970
They acquired Genentech, which is a Google
Apps customer, and Roche has decided to deploy

00:20:06.970 --> 00:20:10.030
Google across their entire employee base.

00:20:10.030 --> 00:20:12.410
So it's a very, very powerful trend.

00:20:12.410 --> 00:20:16.910
We call this trend Going Google and we put
together a few short videos to show you what

00:20:16.910 --> 00:20:18.280
it is like to go Google.

00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:22.590
Let's take a look.

00:20:22.590 --> 00:20:27.780

00:20:27.780 --> 00:20:29.429

up on, so --

00:20:34.641 --> 00:20:36.620
&gt;&gt;&gt; Well, we should regroup.

00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:37.780
&gt;&gt;&gt; We just regrouped.

00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:38.970
This is the regrouping.

&gt;&gt;&gt; She's an angry tiger.

00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:48.180
She's a mangobbler.

00:21:48.180 --> 00:21:49.650
Eater.

00:21:49.650 --> 00:21:50.650
She's a maneater.

00:21:50.650 --> 00:21:52.600
Oh, here she comes.

00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:56.350
Watch out, boy, she'll chew you up.

00:21:56.350 --> 00:22:01.170
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Sundar Pichai: As I said earlier, this is

00:22:01.170 --> 00:22:04.200
a fundamental and radically different way
to collaborate.

00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:06.350
Just try doing that with SharePoint.

00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:10.450
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Sundar Pichai: But ten weeks ago we launched

00:22:10.450 --> 00:22:14.480
Google Drive, one more step in this journey.

00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:21.340
In just over ten weeks over 10 million users
have signed into Google Drive, they're creating

00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:26.840
and collaborating both with Google applications
and third-party applications, and storing

00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:28.930
all their important data.

00:22:28.930 --> 00:22:32.540
And this is another step in our journey to
help users go Google.

00:22:32.540 --> 00:22:37.250
To talk about our journey with drive, I'd
like to invite Clay Bavor, director of product

00:22:37.250 --> 00:22:40.260
management for Google Apps.

00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:51.150
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Clay Bavor: Thank you, Sundar.

00:22:51.150 --> 00:22:55.010
As Sundar said, Google Drive is all about
making it really easy to live life in the

00:22:55.010 --> 00:22:56.010
cloud.

00:22:56.010 --> 00:23:01.370
And that starts by making all of your files
available on all of your devices anywhere.

00:23:01.370 --> 00:23:06.780
And to do that we've built a really nice Web
interface, desktop sync applications for Windows

00:23:06.780 --> 00:23:12.760
and for Mac, and also a really, really nice
Android app, but like with Chrome we want

00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:17.390
Drive to be available on every platform, so
today I'm really excited to announce we're

00:23:17.390 --> 00:23:21.140
making it available on iOS and on Chrome OS.

00:23:21.140 --> 00:23:28.480
[ Cheers and Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Clay Bavor: So let me start here on iOS

00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:29.670
here on the iPad.

00:23:29.670 --> 00:23:32.950
I'm just going to zoom out a bit.

00:23:32.950 --> 00:23:35.630
And I'll just open up Drive.

00:23:35.630 --> 00:23:37.960
You can see the interface is really, really
fluid.

00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:39.630
It works just like you'd expect.

00:23:39.630 --> 00:23:42.860
You can browse through dozens and dozens of
file types.

00:23:42.860 --> 00:23:45.430
Here I'll pull up a photo.

00:23:45.430 --> 00:23:49.260
It's a bigger photo than I remember.

00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:53.490
And everything just works like you'd expect,
but it's not just browsing that we've made

00:23:53.490 --> 00:23:55.180
available on the iOS experience.

00:23:55.180 --> 00:24:00.140
We've brought a lot of the best features of
Drive right to the mobile and tablet experience.

00:24:00.140 --> 00:24:03.450
So for example, I'm going to open up this
folder of receipts here.

00:24:03.450 --> 00:24:04.680
I'm a big nerd.

00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:09.020
I scan all of my receipts, but I was also
too lazy to actually title any of these.

00:24:09.020 --> 00:24:13.500
But I know that somewhere in here there's
a receipt from the post office with a tracking

00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:14.500
number.

00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:19.610
So what I can do here is just search -- and
I'm going to type "certified mail."

00:24:19.610 --> 00:24:22.270
I think that word was in there somewhere.

00:24:22.270 --> 00:24:32.270
And just like that I can pull up 
the receipt.

00:24:32.270 --> 00:24:34.040
[ Cheers and Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Clay Bavor: Notice this isn't a text file.

00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:35.040
There's no text in here.

00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:36.340
I haven't written anything.

00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:40.580
Instead we used optical character recognition
technology to actually extract the text from

00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:43.390
the scan, index it and then make it searchable.

00:24:43.390 --> 00:24:46.950
Now, the cool thing is that doesn't just work
with text.

00:24:46.950 --> 00:24:53.030
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Clay Bavor: Yeah, it's pretty cool.

00:24:53.030 --> 00:24:55.370
It doesn't just work with text, it works with
photos, too.

00:24:55.370 --> 00:24:57.310
Let me show you what I mean.

00:24:57.310 --> 00:24:58.940
So here I have a big pile of photos.

00:24:58.940 --> 00:25:03.250
I took a trip with my wife through Africa
last year, and I know somewhere in here are

00:25:03.250 --> 00:25:08.460
photos of us at the pyramids, but again, I
didn't title my photos, I didn't add keywords,

00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:19.370
but if I search for pyramids, just do a search,
up come the images of us at the pyramids.

00:25:19.370 --> 00:25:25.760
[ Cheers and Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Clay Bavor: So again, we can actually use

00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:30.309
image recognition technology to peer inside
of the images to actually understand the content.

00:25:30.309 --> 00:25:33.210
I don't have to do anything, no labels, no
metadata, no nothing.

00:25:33.210 --> 00:25:35.650
It just works.

00:25:35.650 --> 00:25:39.090
Of course, I don't always have an internet
connection, so Drive makes it really easy

00:25:39.090 --> 00:25:41.420
to just save things, cache them offline.

00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:45.809
So here I'll just save this manual offline
so I can read it whenever.

00:25:45.809 --> 00:25:50.270
And of course, at its core Drive is about
enabling sharing and collaboration.

00:25:50.270 --> 00:25:54.110
So I can add users to collaborate in documents
with me right from the app.

00:25:54.110 --> 00:26:01.270
So here's I think a relevant document here.

00:26:01.270 --> 00:26:05.190
I haven't gotten very far, but I'm going to
add Brian right here.

00:26:05.190 --> 00:26:06.850
He's now backstage.

00:26:06.850 --> 00:26:10.190
And we'll see if he has any other ideas, give
him edit access.

00:26:10.190 --> 00:26:11.450
I've added him right there.

00:26:11.450 --> 00:26:13.670
We'll come back to that in a second.

00:26:13.670 --> 00:26:19.300
So that's Google Drive on iOS to be available
for iPad, iPhone, iPod Touch later today.

00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:20.300
Check it out.

00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:22.300
I think you'll like it.

00:26:22.300 --> 00:26:27.970
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Clay Bavor: So if we can go over to the

00:26:27.970 --> 00:26:31.420
Chromebook now, I want to show you Drive on
Chrome OS.

00:26:31.420 --> 00:26:35.430
So with Drive on Chrome OS, what we did was
actually integrate it deep into the operating

00:26:35.430 --> 00:26:36.430
system.

00:26:36.430 --> 00:26:40.980
So what I can do here is I'm just going to
open up my application tray, open up files,

00:26:40.980 --> 00:26:44.130
and basically Google Drive is just the file
system.

00:26:44.130 --> 00:26:45.620
It's your hard drive in the cloud.

00:26:45.620 --> 00:26:50.310
And we sync down everything silently so that
you can all of your stuff whenever you need

00:26:50.310 --> 00:26:52.410
it everywhere, right there.

00:26:52.410 --> 00:26:57.770
So of course, Drive does a lot more than just
sync your files to the cloud.

00:26:57.770 --> 00:26:59.710
It enables some amazing applications.

00:26:59.710 --> 00:27:04.710
And one of those is real time collaboration
in the cloud with applications like Google

00:27:04.710 --> 00:27:05.710
Docs.

00:27:05.710 --> 00:27:07.770
So I'm going to open up this document here.

00:27:07.770 --> 00:27:10.860
There we go.

00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:17.240
And I'm also going to pull it up on my smartphone
and on my tablet.

00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:22.130
Here is on my smartphone.

00:27:22.130 --> 00:27:38.850
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Clay Bavor: Show some LOL cats.

00:27:38.850 --> 00:27:46.840
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Clay Bavor: And here's everything synced

00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:49.850
across all of my devices.

00:27:49.850 --> 00:27:51.710
Keystroke by keystroke I can see these edits.

00:27:51.710 --> 00:27:53.100
Everything just works.

00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:57.680
Now, this last point is an important one.

00:27:57.680 --> 00:28:01.250
Google Docs works great if you're connected
to the internet, but what if you're on a plane

00:28:01.250 --> 00:28:02.640
or you don't have a connection?

00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:04.070
What about then?

00:28:04.070 --> 00:28:09.070
We've been thinking about that and we're really
excited to announce that today Google Documents

00:28:09.070 --> 00:28:11.250
works for editing offline.

00:28:11.250 --> 00:28:19.980
[ Cheers and Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Clay Bavor: So let me show you how this

00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:20.980
works.

00:28:20.980 --> 00:28:24.240
So what I'm going to do is we've turned out
of wireless on the laptop here and I'm just

00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:27.080
going to unplug the ethernet cable.

00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:29.350
So there it is, it's unplugged.

00:28:29.350 --> 00:28:38.041
And just to prove to you that I am offline,
"New York Times," no connection, but I can

00:28:38.041 --> 00:28:48.900
just go back to my Google Doc and I can keep
editing just like I'm online.

00:28:48.900 --> 00:28:53.820
All the formatting still works, and you'll
see that Google Docs has just noticed gracefully

00:28:53.820 --> 00:28:55.790
I'm offline.

00:28:55.790 --> 00:29:00.580
All my changes are just saved locally to a
local cache and I can keep on without even

00:29:00.580 --> 00:29:01.580
thinking about it.

00:29:01.580 --> 00:29:04.740
It all just works without me even noticing.

00:29:04.740 --> 00:29:10.350
So what I'm going to do now is I've made some
changes offline, maybe Brian and folks backstage

00:29:10.350 --> 00:29:11.620
are making some more changes.

00:29:11.620 --> 00:29:17.610
I'm going to close this document, all my changes
are saved, I'm going to plug ethernet back

00:29:17.610 --> 00:29:23.750
in, and now watch what happens when I open
the document, because it's going to happen

00:29:23.750 --> 00:29:24.750
pretty quickly.

00:29:24.750 --> 00:29:28.570
I'm going to open it back up in Drive and
like that it will be synced back to the cloud

00:29:28.570 --> 00:29:32.220
and you will see it across all of my devices
updated in real time.

00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:33.820
So let me open up the Drive Web interface.

00:29:33.820 --> 00:29:34.840
Here it is.

00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:39.510
I'm going to open up this document -- and
get ready because it happens quick.

00:29:39.510 --> 00:29:41.840
And there it is.

00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:52.460
[ Cheers and Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Clay Bavor: Everything just syncs.

00:29:52.460 --> 00:29:54.850
And once you've shown the feature, move on
to the next thing.

00:29:54.850 --> 00:29:58.090
So that's Google Documents working offline.

00:29:58.090 --> 00:29:59.090
It's available today.

00:29:59.090 --> 00:30:01.710
We're working on offline presentations and
spreadsheets.

00:30:01.710 --> 00:30:02.800
Those are coming soon.

00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:06.600
But if you're flying back from Google I/O
and you don't have internet on the plane,

00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:07.600
try out Google Docs.

00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:10.120
It works great.

00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:12.870
So Google Docs offline.

00:30:12.870 --> 00:30:19.820
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Clay Bavor: Now, if we could just go to

00:30:19.820 --> 00:30:26.070
the Chromebook, Google Documents is just one
application that Google Drive makes possible.

00:30:26.070 --> 00:30:31.470
But users can also create and edit and share
all sorts of stuff with dozens and dozens

00:30:31.470 --> 00:30:36.080
of third-party applications that have integrated
with Google Drive using the Google Drive SDK.

00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:42.170
We've actually just updated our SDK to Version
2 today, and let me show you what's possible

00:30:42.170 --> 00:30:43.570
with this SDK.

00:30:43.570 --> 00:30:49.040
So as a user I can do is go to the Web store,
add additional apps that integrate with Drive,

00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:51.870
and they show up here in the more menu.

00:30:51.870 --> 00:30:57.000
So I can fax, I can send and receive faxes
with Hellofax right from Google Drive, so

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:01.120
you can get rid of your fax machine and just
have faxes come straight to Drive.

00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:04.350
I can create and edit images and videos and
charts.

00:31:04.350 --> 00:31:09.510
And now, the neat thing about the way the
integrations work is files you create with

00:31:09.510 --> 00:31:15.059
these third-party applications, they're stored
alongside everything else, just like regular

00:31:15.059 --> 00:31:16.059
files.

00:31:16.059 --> 00:31:19.480
So I've created a couple of diagrams for Google
I/O, and I just click that.

00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:22.430
And notice I don't have to log in or authenticate.

00:31:22.430 --> 00:31:28.240
It just launches the file, it opens the application,
takes a couple of seconds, and then we're

00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:31.790
in Lucidchart, one of my favorite applications.

00:31:31.790 --> 00:31:35.049
This is a really deep statement here.

00:31:35.049 --> 00:31:39.450
So one of the neat things about Drive is our
developers -- not only do they get access

00:31:39.450 --> 00:31:46.030
to millions and millions of users, authentication,
sharing, Google Drive storage, but they're

00:31:46.030 --> 00:31:50.270
telling us that their users that come from
Drive are actually more active than users

00:31:50.270 --> 00:31:52.710
that come to their applications directly.

00:31:52.710 --> 00:31:57.490
So Lucidchart tells us their users when they
come from Drive, because of the sharing and

00:31:57.490 --> 00:32:00.130
ease of creation, create three times more
diagrams.

00:32:00.130 --> 00:32:03.140
Hellofax users send 25% more faxes.

00:32:03.140 --> 00:32:07.360
SlideRocket users are three and a half times
as likely to create a presentation.

00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:10.850
So developers are seeing really, really great
distribution using Drive.

00:32:10.850 --> 00:32:16.920
We actually have a session right after this
at 11:45 in Room 8 on the Drive SDK.

00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:21.290
Actually, this morning I just whipped up a
little diagram to help get you there in case

00:32:21.290 --> 00:32:22.890
you're interested.

00:32:22.890 --> 00:32:26.460
Room 8, 11:45.

00:32:26.460 --> 00:32:29.110
So that's the Google Drive SDK.

00:32:29.110 --> 00:32:30.270
Version 2 is coming out today.

00:32:30.270 --> 00:32:31.870
We're really excited about it.

00:32:31.870 --> 00:32:37.340
You also saw Google Drive for iOS and for
Chrome OS and Documents now working offline.

00:32:37.340 --> 00:32:39.530
So we're really excited about where we're
taking Google Drive.

00:32:39.530 --> 00:32:41.150
We hope you will join us.

00:32:41.150 --> 00:32:43.029
Thanks very much.

00:32:43.029 --> 00:32:50.549
[ Cheers and applause ]
&gt;&gt;Sundar Pichai: Thank you, Clay.

00:32:50.549 --> 00:32:58.429
So just like Chrome, Google cloud applications,
Google Drive now also works on Windows, Mac,

00:32:58.429 --> 00:33:05.280
Android, iOS, Chrome OS, across all your platforms.
and all your devices so that you can live

00:33:05.280 --> 00:33:06.390
online on the cloud seamlessly.

00:33:06.390 --> 00:33:09.740
So we are very excited by that.

00:33:09.740 --> 00:33:14.490
Quite a few years ago, we set out on this
journey to really help users live in the cloud,

00:33:14.490 --> 00:33:17.060
to design an end-to-end computing experience.

00:33:17.060 --> 00:33:19.160
And that's what the Chrome OS journey is all
about.

00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:23.700
A year ago, at Google I/O, we launched our
first-generation Chromebooks.

00:33:23.700 --> 00:33:29.179
Our goal was to get the product out there,
help seed the market, get feedback from developers

00:33:29.179 --> 00:33:30.430
like you.

00:33:30.430 --> 00:33:32.070
Since then, we've been hard at work.

00:33:32.070 --> 00:33:37.580
We release a version of the operating system
every six weeks and automatically update it

00:33:37.580 --> 00:33:39.250
to all Chromebooks out there.

00:33:39.250 --> 00:33:41.440
There are no versions, no downloads, no installs.

00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:42.980
We constantly update them.

00:33:42.980 --> 00:33:47.420
We brought it all together about three weeks
ago for the next-generation Chromebooks.

00:33:47.420 --> 00:33:50.380
There are three main aspects to it.

00:33:50.380 --> 00:33:52.880
First of all, they're significantly faster.

00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:58.340
They are about 3X faster than the first-generation
Chromebooks, thanks to faster processors.

00:33:58.340 --> 00:34:02.730
And the entire software stack is now hardware
accelerated, so it's really fast and smooth,

00:34:02.730 --> 00:34:05.210
as fast as in computers which are around $1,000.

00:34:05.210 --> 00:34:08.320
It has a full end-to-end user experience.

00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:10.889
You saw a bit of that earlier.

00:34:10.889 --> 00:34:14.250
It is -- it treats applications as first-class
citizens.

00:34:14.250 --> 00:34:16.560
So you're no longer tied to a browser window.

00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:18.419
You can have full screen experiences.

00:34:18.419 --> 00:34:22.550
You can have applications side by side, multiple
windows, you can pin them to the task bar,

00:34:22.550 --> 00:34:23.650
et cetera.

00:34:23.650 --> 00:34:26.700
And we are really investing in the application
ecosystem.

00:34:26.700 --> 00:34:31.050
You saw examples with Google Drive working
on it and important applications like Google

00:34:31.050 --> 00:34:32.450
Documents now working offline.

00:34:32.450 --> 00:34:37.080
One of the things which excites about it is
we call it the "always new" computer.

00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:41.800
Since we update it automatically, even people
who bought the first-generation Chromebook,

00:34:41.800 --> 00:34:45.700
a lot of them wrote to us three weeks ago
and said they opened their computer, it got

00:34:45.700 --> 00:34:49.370
faster, and they have a whole new window manager
at work, just like that.

00:34:49.370 --> 00:34:53.869
So we are very excited by the model we are
working on, and we are going to be investing

00:34:53.869 --> 00:34:55.580
a lot more here.

00:34:55.580 --> 00:34:58.930
One of the feedbacks, the last version was
well received, but more people wanted to get

00:34:58.930 --> 00:35:01.820
their hands on and see what these are like.

00:35:01.820 --> 00:35:07.120
So as of today, we are going to make Chromebooks
available in physical retail, 100 Best Buy

00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:09.990
stores all across the United States.

00:35:09.990 --> 00:35:14.300
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Sundar Pichai: So that users can try them

00:35:14.300 --> 00:35:15.810
and buy them.

00:35:15.810 --> 00:35:19.240
We are doing the same in U.K., with Dixon's
as well.

00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:23.160
As we go through the next few months, you're
going to see a lot more.

00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:27.500
We are working with many more OEMs and Intel
to get a whole lineup ready for the holiday

00:35:27.500 --> 00:35:28.500
season.

00:35:28.500 --> 00:35:31.070
So stay tuned.

00:35:31.070 --> 00:35:38.000
One of the things when I came to Google in
2004, I was inspired by taking a tour of our

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:39.460
data center.

00:35:39.460 --> 00:35:45.200
Just walking inside them and seeing hundreds
and hundreds of computers powering applications

00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:50.540
like Google Search, and we had just launched
Gmail, and seeing the scale of the infrastructure

00:35:50.540 --> 00:35:53.390
needed was inspiring.

00:35:53.390 --> 00:35:58.640
But it is very hard for Web developers externally
to get access to that kind of infrastructure.

00:35:58.640 --> 00:36:03.740
We want you to write great Web applications,
so we've been thinking hard about how to provide

00:36:03.740 --> 00:36:07.830
you with the same quality of infrastructure
we enjoy at Google.

00:36:07.830 --> 00:36:13.720
To do that, I want to invite Urs Hoelzle,
our first V.P. of engineering, one of the

00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:18.080
first ten employees at Google, and the person,
more than anyone, responsible for building

00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:19.940
all of Google's infrastructure.

00:36:19.940 --> 00:36:21.190
Urs.

00:36:21.190 --> 00:36:31.230
[ Cheers and applause ]
&gt;&gt;Urs Hoelzle: Thank you, Sundar.

00:36:31.230 --> 00:36:40.710
We've heard a great many things today about
applications, clients, and -- but I'm here

00:36:40.710 --> 00:36:48.700
today to talk about servers and the infrastructure
that powers all these applications.

00:36:48.700 --> 00:36:55.280
A long time ago, at Google, we started working
very hard to build the world's fastest, most

00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:58.100
scalable, and most reliable infrastructure.

00:36:58.100 --> 00:37:04.869
We needed our infrastructure to deliver incredible
scale and incredible performance at a very

00:37:04.869 --> 00:37:05.900
low cost.

00:37:05.900 --> 00:37:11.270
And over the years, we built one of the world's
largest set of data centers and one of the

00:37:11.270 --> 00:37:14.490
world's largest networks to connect these
data centers.

00:37:14.490 --> 00:37:20.300
And then we started looking at ways to deliver
that infrastructure to you so that you can

00:37:20.300 --> 00:37:23.020
build great applications for your users.

00:37:23.020 --> 00:37:27.520
So in 2008, we launched App Engine.

00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:31.670
App Engine lets you write simple, intuitive
code to build your apps.

00:37:31.670 --> 00:37:35.630
And then we take them and we manage them and
we scale them for you.

00:37:35.630 --> 00:37:41.770
So if you have one request per second or 1,000
requests per second, it just works.

00:37:41.770 --> 00:37:45.650
We're thrilled about the popularity of App
Engine.

00:37:45.650 --> 00:37:54.670
Today, it's supporting over 1 million active
applications, 7.5 billion hits per day every

00:37:54.670 --> 00:37:59.680
day, and 2 trillion data store operations
per month.

00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:05.380
That easily makes it the largest public, NoSQL
data store infrastructure in the world.

00:38:05.380 --> 00:38:08.890
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Urs Hoelzle: Thank you.

00:38:08.890 --> 00:38:13.150
So more and more developers are using App
Engine.

00:38:13.150 --> 00:38:16.170
And every day, we hear success stories from
them.

00:38:16.170 --> 00:38:24.030
Here's one from Japan, where earlier this
month, a fully one-third of Japan was watching

00:38:24.030 --> 00:38:26.330
a national song contest.

00:38:26.330 --> 00:38:31.620
And App Engine was powering the live streaming
and the voting for this event.

00:38:31.620 --> 00:38:36.890
At its peak, it ran at 24,000 requests per
second.

00:38:36.890 --> 00:38:42.890
Yet, no other App Engine user noticed that
this was going on.

00:38:42.890 --> 00:38:47.920
So the ability to sail through this kind of
traffic spike allows you to focus on your

00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:53.200
application while we focus on handling the
traffic.

00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:58.970
So we're very proud of what App Engine has
enabled all of you developers to do.

00:38:58.970 --> 00:39:02.630
But many of you have said you want even more
options.

00:39:02.630 --> 00:39:10.360
And, specifically, you've told us that you
want virtual machines on demand with industry-leading

00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:17.160
performance, with industry-leading scalability,
and so easy and cheap to run that you'd prefer

00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:19.180
them to your in-house servers.

00:39:19.180 --> 00:39:25.410
Well, today, I'm going to show you what it
is like to run in Google's cloud.

00:39:25.410 --> 00:39:30.770
I'm here to announce Google Compute Engine,
infrastructure as a service that delivers

00:39:30.770 --> 00:39:34.570
the kind of performance --
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:39:34.570 --> 00:39:40.550
&gt;&gt;Urs Hoelzle: -- and scale and value --
[ Applause ]

00:39:40.550 --> 00:39:44.590
&gt;&gt;Urs Hoelzle: You haven't seen anything yet.

00:39:44.590 --> 00:39:45.590
Thanks.

00:39:45.590 --> 00:39:48.369
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Urs Hoelzle: But the infrastructure as a

00:39:48.369 --> 00:39:53.530
service that delivers the performance and
scale and value that only Google can deliver.

00:39:53.530 --> 00:39:57.880
So Compute Engine gives you Linux virtual
machines at Google scale.

00:39:57.880 --> 00:40:00.990
Spin up two VMs or 10,000 VMs.

00:40:00.990 --> 00:40:01.990
It just works.

00:40:01.990 --> 00:40:07.870
You have multiple storage options, high-performance
networking between VMs so that you can form

00:40:07.870 --> 00:40:14.930
them into a cluster and great connectivity
to your end users using Google's global backbone.

00:40:14.930 --> 00:40:19.690
So let me show what Compute Engine and App
Engine together can do.

00:40:19.690 --> 00:40:26.310
One of our beta testers was the Institute
for Systems Biology.

00:40:26.310 --> 00:40:34.450
The ISB uses genomic analysis to decipher
how genes function and to find relationships

00:40:34.450 --> 00:40:40.060
between the genes that signal the potential
for new cancer drugs.

00:40:40.060 --> 00:40:45.420
They wrote an App Engine app that connected
to Compute Engine virtual machines.

00:40:45.420 --> 00:40:53.020
And you'll see it here on the screen here.

00:40:53.020 --> 00:40:58.290
They show the human genome in a circular form.

00:40:58.290 --> 00:41:04.160
And the application allows researchers to
visually explore the associations between

00:41:04.160 --> 00:41:06.540
genes, mutations, and other factors.

00:41:06.540 --> 00:41:11.540
And each of these associations is shown with
a blue line like that.

00:41:11.540 --> 00:41:18.349
Now, this may look simple, but this kind of
analysis requires a tremendous amount of computation.

00:41:18.349 --> 00:41:25.680
So ISB built an in-house cluster with 1,000
nodes to handle this kind of computation.

00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:32.150
Yet it still took them ten minutes to compute
just a single association using the entire

00:41:32.150 --> 00:41:33.150
cluster.

00:41:33.150 --> 00:41:40.960
So, fortunately, it took only a few days to
port this application to Compute Engine.

00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:45.430
And let's see how Compute Engine performs
on this application.

00:41:45.430 --> 00:41:53.220
Now, remember, on their in-house 1,000-core
cluster, what you would see here is one line

00:41:53.220 --> 00:42:00.020
appear, you know, click, and then you'd wait
for ten minutes to see the next line.

00:42:00.020 --> 00:42:04.270
So let's see what Compute Engine can do with
this.

00:42:04.270 --> 00:42:05.530
(Ticking).

00:42:05.530 --> 00:42:10.560
&gt;&gt;Urs Hoelzle: All right.

00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:16.760
So this is what happens when you add 10,000
cores to your application.

00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:22.250
Instead of it taking ten minutes, you get
a new association every few seconds.

00:42:22.250 --> 00:42:26.370
That's the kind of scalability and performance
that Google can deliver.

00:42:26.370 --> 00:42:34.440
And so today, anyone with large-scale computing
needs can now access this same infrastructure

00:42:34.440 --> 00:42:38.160
with Compute Engine virtual machines.

00:42:38.160 --> 00:42:45.230
And this infrastructure comes with a scale
and a performance and a value that is unparalleled

00:42:45.230 --> 00:42:49.800
in the industry, because you benefit from
the efficiency of Google data centers and

00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:52.380
our decade of experience in running them.

00:42:52.380 --> 00:42:58.710
What you get from Google is not just the scale,
but also amazing stable performance.

00:42:58.710 --> 00:43:04.900
So our virtual machines and storage are predictably
fast so you can rely on a consistent level

00:43:04.900 --> 00:43:11.080
of performance, no matter who else is running
on Compute Engine right now, just as App Engine

00:43:11.080 --> 00:43:15.970
was able to handle a huge spike in the Japanese
application.

00:43:15.970 --> 00:43:24.430
For example, when Invite Media ported their
ad server from another cloud provider to Compute

00:43:24.430 --> 00:43:32.740
Engine, they were able to double the number
of connections that each single VM can accept

00:43:32.740 --> 00:43:39.260
at -- using VMs of comparable size, and, more
importantly, they were able to reduce the

00:43:39.260 --> 00:43:45.590
number of connection errors by over a factor
of ten because of the predictable performance.

00:43:45.590 --> 00:43:51.840
You can hear more directly from Compute Engine
beta users in the technical sessions about

00:43:51.840 --> 00:43:57.960
Compute Engine which you will see show up
on your I/O calendar after this talk.

00:43:57.960 --> 00:44:00.349
So be sure to check them out.

00:44:00.349 --> 00:44:05.400
Now, finally, we know that you want top scalability
and top performance.

00:44:05.400 --> 00:44:08.460
But you also need value.

00:44:08.460 --> 00:44:16.540
And Compute Engine is a great value, delivering
up to 50% more compute per dollar than other

00:44:16.540 --> 00:44:21.290
cloud providers, so you don't have to choose
between getting the best performance and getting

00:44:21.290 --> 00:44:22.599
the best price.

00:44:22.599 --> 00:44:27.070
We worked very hard for a decade to lower
the cost of computing, and we're passing these

00:44:27.070 --> 00:44:29.830
savings on to you.

00:44:29.830 --> 00:44:37.369
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Urs Hoelzle: Compute Engine is now open

00:44:37.369 --> 00:44:38.520
in limited preview.

00:44:38.520 --> 00:44:41.720
And it's amazing to finally be able to talk
about this.

00:44:41.720 --> 00:44:47.799
It's amazing to see 10,000 cores working for
a single application and what that can do.

00:44:47.799 --> 00:44:51.100
So 10,000 cores, I think that's really cool.

00:44:51.100 --> 00:44:53.470
But you know what really cool?

00:44:53.470 --> 00:44:57.369
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Urs Hoelzle: Well, we know that some of

00:44:57.369 --> 00:44:59.230
you need even more scale.

00:44:59.230 --> 00:45:02.160
And we have the technology to help you.

00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:08.880
For computations that are very, very computationally
intensive but don't need that much I/O, we

00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:12.320
can scale much, much higher.

00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:17.440
You may have noticed this ticker counting
up since the start of my presentation.

00:45:17.440 --> 00:45:21.470
Well, this ticker is not a conceptual counter.

00:45:21.470 --> 00:45:27.980
It shows the actual count of the number of
cores available to the genome app right now.

00:45:27.980 --> 00:45:32.080
And they've all been adding since the beginning
of this presentation.

00:45:32.080 --> 00:45:38.859
So what would you say to 770,000 cores available
to your app?

00:45:38.859 --> 00:45:49.400
[ Cheers and applause ]
&gt;&gt;Urs Hoelzle: So if you're ISB, you would

00:45:49.400 --> 00:45:55.420
say, actually, my app kind of taps out at
600,000 cores.

00:45:55.420 --> 00:45:57.400
It doesn't scale any further.

00:45:57.400 --> 00:46:07.760
So let's leave 170,000 idle and allocate 600,000
to the genome app and see how fast it runs.

00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:08.810
Switch to the app.

00:46:08.810 --> 00:46:09.810
Right.

00:46:09.810 --> 00:46:13.860
There's a little initial delay.

00:46:13.860 --> 00:46:14.860
And then we really get going.

00:46:14.860 --> 00:46:30.730
[ Cheers and applause ]
&gt;&gt;Urs Hoelzle: So this is the same computation

00:46:30.730 --> 00:46:34.420
now running on 600,000 cores.

00:46:34.420 --> 00:46:36.130
That is cool!

00:46:36.130 --> 00:46:41.260
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Urs Hoelzle: And that is how Infrastructure

00:46:41.260 --> 00:46:45.010
as a Service is supposed to work.

00:46:45.010 --> 00:46:51.150
So this, ladies and gentlemen, truly is the
best time ever to deliver and to build for

00:46:51.150 --> 00:46:52.150
the Web.

00:46:52.150 --> 00:46:56.940
You now have access to the scale and performance
of Google's infrastructure at a great price.

00:46:56.940 --> 00:47:01.480
And it's up to you to figure out how to make
the best use of that.

00:47:01.480 --> 00:47:03.580
So with that, back to Sundar.

00:47:03.580 --> 00:47:04.830
Thank you.

00:47:04.830 --> 00:47:12.369
[ Cheers and applause ]
&gt;&gt;Sundar Pichai: Woo-hoo!

00:47:12.369 --> 00:47:18.640
I was jumping up back there when I saw the
600,000 cores, the kind of scale you can only

00:47:18.640 --> 00:47:20.170
dream about.

00:47:20.170 --> 00:47:24.010
It's incredibly exciting that you all now
have access to what we have had internally

00:47:24.010 --> 00:47:25.010
at Google.

00:47:25.010 --> 00:47:27.710
I can't wait to see what you all build next.

00:47:27.710 --> 00:47:32.330
Of course, infrastructure is only one component
of writing great Web applications.

00:47:32.330 --> 00:47:35.580
The other thing is the actual underlying platform.

00:47:35.580 --> 00:47:40.222
And we've been working hard with a lot of
you and other browser vendors and the open

00:47:40.222 --> 00:47:43.150
Web community to advance that forward.

00:47:43.150 --> 00:47:46.680
What you're seeing behind me -- let's switch
to the visualization, please.

00:47:46.680 --> 00:47:52.290
What you're seeing behind me is the visualization
of how the Web platform was evolved over the

00:47:52.290 --> 00:47:53.870
years.

00:47:53.870 --> 00:48:00.500
It's inspiring and humbling to see names like
Mosaic, Netscape, the introduction of HTML,

00:48:00.500 --> 00:48:01.790
CSS.

00:48:01.790 --> 00:48:06.910
But what's interesting is, as you go to the
far right, you can see it gets denser.

00:48:06.910 --> 00:48:08.359
It's much richer.

00:48:08.359 --> 00:48:14.900
That's because the Web platform is evolving
at a faster pace than ever before, which makes

00:48:14.900 --> 00:48:20.610
sense, because the Web is increasingly being
used across many, many new types of devices:

00:48:20.610 --> 00:48:22.849
Phone, tablets, and so on.

00:48:22.849 --> 00:48:27.010
And we need to make sure we have all the Web
to support those use cases.

00:48:27.010 --> 00:48:29.930
The good news is, it's happening very fast.

00:48:29.930 --> 00:48:35.620
One of the great things about the Web is,
as we add APIs, developers like you immediately

00:48:35.620 --> 00:48:38.780
take advantage of it to write great Web applications.

00:48:38.780 --> 00:48:40.339
So let me give one example.

00:48:40.339 --> 00:48:47.050
About a year and a half ago, from the Chrome
team, we decided to support games, rich games,

00:48:47.050 --> 00:48:48.150
online.

00:48:48.150 --> 00:48:49.250
Why?

00:48:49.250 --> 00:48:51.119
Games tend to push the limits of a platform.

00:48:51.119 --> 00:48:52.859
They are really hard on the platform.

00:48:52.859 --> 00:48:56.339
And if you can run games, you can pretty much
do anything else.

00:48:56.339 --> 00:49:00.480
So we talked to game developers, and we found
out what APIs they need.

00:49:00.480 --> 00:49:03.060
A lot of it was what we were already working
on.

00:49:03.060 --> 00:49:05.390
And we started adding them to Chrome.

00:49:05.390 --> 00:49:07.349
So let's take a look at what's happening.

00:49:07.349 --> 00:49:09.070
So let's switch to a game.

00:49:09.070 --> 00:49:10.690
Kan is going to help me with it.

00:49:10.690 --> 00:49:14.230
What we are showing you -- can you switch
to the game, please.

00:49:14.230 --> 00:49:19.060
What we are showing you is a game called Gaikai,
which is being streamed.

00:49:19.060 --> 00:49:20.740
It's a service called Gaikai.

00:49:20.740 --> 00:49:23.800
This is being streamed live online.

00:49:23.800 --> 00:49:26.140
And they can do it to any Internet-connected
devices.

00:49:26.140 --> 00:49:27.740
There is no download.

00:49:27.740 --> 00:49:28.740
There is no install.

00:49:28.740 --> 00:49:30.930
You just click and play different games.

00:49:30.930 --> 00:49:33.560
This particular game is called Bulletstorm.

00:49:33.560 --> 00:49:36.810
And I've been assured all do you is shoot
aliens in this process.

00:49:36.810 --> 00:49:38.089
So let's take a look.

00:49:38.089 --> 00:49:41.060
So Kan is going to load up the game and play.

00:49:41.060 --> 00:49:46.570
What you will notice is that, first of all,
it's a rich, full-screen experience.

00:49:46.570 --> 00:49:47.570
It's very immersive.

00:49:47.570 --> 00:49:50.200
We do it through the full-screen API.

00:49:50.200 --> 00:49:53.620
The sound effects are all enhanced audio APIs
we have added in the last year.

00:49:53.620 --> 00:49:58.040
To do a game like this, you need really good
performance.

00:49:58.040 --> 00:49:59.750
You need raw network access.

00:49:59.750 --> 00:50:01.359
We do it through UDP.

00:50:01.359 --> 00:50:05.859
The local performance on the client you see
there is being done because we are executing

00:50:05.859 --> 00:50:07.670
in the native client sandbox.

00:50:07.670 --> 00:50:11.650
And, finally, to do something like this, obviously,
Kan is using a game pad.

00:50:11.650 --> 00:50:16.750
We needed to give access to a peripheral like
the game pad with a game pad API.

00:50:16.750 --> 00:50:19.230
Doing that, you can see a rich game.

00:50:19.230 --> 00:50:20.730
By the way, it's running in a Chromebook.

00:50:20.730 --> 00:50:27.700
You can spin it around because everything
is hardware accelerated.

00:50:27.700 --> 00:50:32.800
It's not just Gaikai and Bulletstorm which
have done this, we have -- let's switch to

00:50:32.800 --> 00:50:38.860
the slides -- we have seen several mainstream
games, Angry Birds, cut the rope, all available

00:50:38.860 --> 00:50:40.290
in the Chrome Web Store.

00:50:40.290 --> 00:50:45.599
In fact, even Triple A console-style games
like Bastion, From Dust, are all available

00:50:45.599 --> 00:50:47.170
in the Web Store now to play.

00:50:47.170 --> 00:50:52.220
Angry Birds alone has been played by more
than 140 million users.

00:50:52.220 --> 00:50:57.870
What's happening in games is happening in
every other vertical in the Web Store: Games,

00:50:57.870 --> 00:51:03.390
entertainment, like music, educational apps,
and apps for businesses as well.

00:51:03.390 --> 00:51:09.040
Over 750 million applications have been installed,
and people are enjoying living online in the

00:51:09.040 --> 00:51:10.450
cloud every day.

00:51:10.450 --> 00:51:11.720
And we are just getting started.

00:51:11.720 --> 00:51:14.680
We are going to evolve Chrome apps pretty
significantly.

00:51:14.680 --> 00:51:18.680
There are three major areas we are going to
focus on.

00:51:18.680 --> 00:51:21.599
First is we need to make sure all applications
are always available.

00:51:21.599 --> 00:51:23.710
You saw the example of Docs offline.

00:51:23.710 --> 00:51:27.940
As you write a Chrome application, we are
going to provide developers with a way to

00:51:27.940 --> 00:51:33.550
package resources automatically by default,
including the UI, so that you can always serve

00:51:33.550 --> 00:51:35.380
the application locally.

00:51:35.380 --> 00:51:39.220
The second thing is, we want to make sure
you get an authentic app experience, just

00:51:39.220 --> 00:51:40.540
like what you saw with the game earlier.

00:51:40.540 --> 00:51:45.630
So we want to break out of the browser window
when you want to give full-screen experiences,

00:51:45.630 --> 00:51:49.270
as well as provide new UI containers for applications.

00:51:49.270 --> 00:51:53.990
And, finally, when you write a Chrome application,
we want to make sure you have access to every

00:51:53.990 --> 00:51:58.130
underlying device API across phones, tablets,
and desktops.

00:51:58.130 --> 00:51:59.690
So we are working hard at that.

00:51:59.690 --> 00:52:03.619
If you download the Chrome canary build, you
can see what we are doing there.

00:52:03.619 --> 00:52:07.640
And we have sessions later in the day where
you can get a lot more details.

00:52:07.640 --> 00:52:11.880
It is one thing to write great Web applications.

00:52:11.880 --> 00:52:17.280
But it is an entirely different thing to take
a real-world experience, something with amazing

00:52:17.280 --> 00:52:22.170
artistry, like what Cirque du Soleil creates,
and translate that to the cloud.

00:52:22.170 --> 00:52:27.560
Something very hard to do, and to share that
journey, let me invite Joanne and Aubrey from

00:52:27.560 --> 00:52:30.069
Cirque du Soleil.

00:52:30.069 --> 00:52:43.380
[ Music ]
&gt;&gt;Joanne Fillion: Thank you, Sundar.

00:52:43.380 --> 00:52:47.820
Hello, everyone.

00:52:47.820 --> 00:52:49.950
It's great to be here.

00:52:49.950 --> 00:52:55.000
For those of you who know Cirque du Soleil,
and I hope many of you do, you will understand

00:52:55.000 --> 00:53:02.530
that we always strive to create immersive
and fantastical experiences for our patrons,

00:53:02.530 --> 00:53:06.530
experiences that will make them dream for
a little while.

00:53:06.530 --> 00:53:13.130
We also constantly ask ourselves, how do we
evolve beyond the live world?

00:53:13.130 --> 00:53:17.120
How do we create experiences that reach more
people?

00:53:17.120 --> 00:53:21.630
How do we create worlds that people participate
in?

00:53:21.630 --> 00:53:25.960
The Web is an obvious option, because it can
reach anyone on the planet.

00:53:25.960 --> 00:53:32.720
However, we know how difficult it is to transport
anyone into an imaginary world if they can't

00:53:32.720 --> 00:53:36.390
actually experience it firsthand.

00:53:36.390 --> 00:53:42.530
In this project, we were still facing the
same big question: Could the Web deliver the

00:53:42.530 --> 00:53:45.230
experience we envision?

00:53:45.230 --> 00:53:50.310
Could the technology give the possibility
to the user to actually interact with the

00:53:50.310 --> 00:53:54.140
environment and lose themself in it?

00:53:54.140 --> 00:54:01.480
To create this new world, we knew we needed
to go beyond text, pictures, and videos.

00:54:01.480 --> 00:54:08.080
We all really wanted to evoke people's emotions,
to awaken their imagination, and to enrich

00:54:08.080 --> 00:54:09.980
their lives.

00:54:09.980 --> 00:54:17.070
But I have to say, when we saw the preliminary
result of this project, we all got so excited,

00:54:17.070 --> 00:54:18.980
we were surprised.

00:54:18.980 --> 00:54:24.920
Some of us were actually really touched, and
stunned, I would say, by the depth and the

00:54:24.920 --> 00:54:27.369
richness of the visual animation.

00:54:27.369 --> 00:54:35.880
The creative team and this new technology
have created an experience that evokes a beautiful,

00:54:35.880 --> 00:54:42.180
immersive, and sensorial world that truly
resembles Cirque du Soleil and that can be

00:54:42.180 --> 00:54:47.119
enjoyed by everyone when and where they feel
it.

00:54:47.119 --> 00:54:52.990
The combination of great creative minds in
this new Web technology opened possibilities

00:54:52.990 --> 00:54:56.100
that we didn't know existed before.

00:54:56.100 --> 00:55:01.900
I will let Aubrey, our development partner,
to show you what we built together, and, most

00:55:01.900 --> 00:55:06.300
importantly probably for you guys, how we
built it.

00:55:06.300 --> 00:55:07.560
Aubrey.

00:55:07.560 --> 00:55:13.849
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Aubrey Anderson: Thanks, Joanne.

00:55:13.849 --> 00:55:14.849
It's awesome.

00:55:14.849 --> 00:55:17.980
This is awesome to be here.

00:55:17.980 --> 00:55:19.300
Cirque du Soleil in a browser.

00:55:19.300 --> 00:55:22.010
What a fantastic challenge.

00:55:22.010 --> 00:55:26.040
Let's take a look at our demo and see how
we did.

00:55:26.040 --> 00:55:31.950
Now, in order to get you into the experience
in a different way, we allow you to control

00:55:31.950 --> 00:55:34.900
the navigation and perspective by moving your
body.

00:55:34.900 --> 00:55:38.560
As the experience starts, our tour guide shows
us how to do it.

00:55:38.560 --> 00:55:43.280
We've used the Get User Media API inside Web
RTC to enable the user's camera and detect

00:55:43.280 --> 00:55:48.010
faces and track motion, and then we map that
back to the navigation controls in the app.

00:55:48.010 --> 00:55:51.220
Kan, can you move left and right and show
that behavior.

00:55:51.220 --> 00:55:54.040
There he goes.

00:55:54.040 --> 00:55:57.080
You'll notice Kan's silhouette at the bottom
as he moves.

00:55:57.080 --> 00:55:59.180
This gives him some feedback about where he
is in space.

00:55:59.180 --> 00:56:03.500
And then once our guide feels like we've got
the hang of it, she opens up the curtains

00:56:03.500 --> 00:56:05.740
and we're invited into her imaginary world.

00:56:05.740 --> 00:56:13.599
I love it when something very complex turns
out to be created with simple ingredients.

00:56:13.599 --> 00:56:15.579
We've created this world completely in HTML.

00:56:15.579 --> 00:56:21.070
We've combined Web video and images and markup
into virtual set pieces which we then position

00:56:21.070 --> 00:56:23.150
in 3D space using CSS.

00:56:23.150 --> 00:56:27.970
You can see how the elements parallax in response
to Kan's movements.

00:56:27.970 --> 00:56:31.339
That's because the elements are each positioned
individually and it creates this very realistic

00:56:31.339 --> 00:56:33.829
interactive environment for us to explore.

00:56:33.829 --> 00:56:38.900
The HTML elements are then brought to life
with CSS animations and filters individually.

00:56:38.900 --> 00:56:43.390
And it's all amazingly fast because of hardware-accelerated
rendering in the browser.

00:56:43.390 --> 00:56:47.230
What you're seeing here is all running on
a Chromebook.

00:56:47.230 --> 00:56:54.880
After exploring this world, we just need to
follow our guide and take the leap.

00:56:54.880 --> 00:56:59.210
And we wanted to accentuate the 3D nature
of this experience with this fall.

00:56:59.210 --> 00:57:02.850
You might consider using a plug-in or a WebGL
to accomplish something like this.

00:57:02.850 --> 00:57:05.850
But what you're seeing here is just DIVs.

00:57:05.850 --> 00:57:14.619
We've used individual CSS animations to spin
the elements and we've used one long 3D transform

00:57:14.619 --> 00:57:16.000

00:57:19.900 --> 00:57:22.780
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Aubrey Anderson: We have one long 3D transform

00:57:22.780 --> 00:57:26.340
which transforms the whole model.

00:57:26.340 --> 00:57:32.790
And at the end of the fall, we splash into
a Vernal Pool where we can enjoy a performance.

00:57:32.790 --> 00:57:36.750
Now, to see how this world is actually put
together, let's take a look at the source.

00:57:36.750 --> 00:57:38.260
I'm feeling brave.

00:57:38.260 --> 00:57:41.880
Kan, can you open up the Chrome developer
tools.

00:57:41.880 --> 00:57:43.630
He's totally already done it.

00:57:43.630 --> 00:57:47.050
Because this is just markup in the browser,
we can actually manipulate these elements

00:57:47.050 --> 00:57:50.910
in real time right while the application is
running.

00:57:50.910 --> 00:57:56.840
Here Kan is able to change the rotation property
in the CSS, and the whole model will move

00:57:56.840 --> 00:57:59.500
in space.

will even still work here and just transforms
the elements from their new position.

00:58:11.270 --> 00:58:16.950
Now, another great thing about this approach
is that it's wonderfully portable.

00:58:16.950 --> 00:58:20.870
For example, it works just as well in a Web
browser on a tablet.

00:58:20.870 --> 00:58:25.560
Kan, will you bring up the app on a device.

00:58:25.560 --> 00:58:27.350
Look, there it is.

00:58:27.350 --> 00:58:31.160
Here, we can take advantage of the unique
capabilities in the device, like the accelerometer

00:58:31.160 --> 00:58:32.210
and gestures.

00:58:32.210 --> 00:58:36.589
Notice as Kan tilts the device, our perspective
is changing in the same way it changed when

00:58:36.589 --> 00:58:39.359
he was tracking to the camera.

00:58:39.359 --> 00:58:43.810
And it just happens for us, because CSS is
giving the instructions and we're letting

00:58:43.810 --> 00:58:49.990
the hardware accelerated browser in whatever
run time we find ourselves in do all the work.

00:58:49.990 --> 00:58:55.180
I hope you've enjoyed this short preview about
what's coming from Cirque du Soleil.

00:58:55.180 --> 00:58:59.020
And I hope it highlights the kind of immersive,
beautiful user experience you can create using

00:58:59.020 --> 00:59:03.990
the HTML skills I bet most of you already
have in a great browser like Google Chrome.

00:59:03.990 --> 00:59:05.270
Thanks.

00:59:05.270 --> 00:59:13.720
[ Cheers and applause ]
&gt;&gt;Sundar Pichai: I've been very impressed

00:59:13.720 --> 00:59:16.089
by watching Cirque du Soleil live and watching
that.

00:59:16.089 --> 00:59:19.840
It shows you the power of the Web today.

00:59:19.840 --> 00:59:23.910
It's been a very exciting journey, and a lot
of it started with Chrome.

00:59:23.910 --> 00:59:26.760
And we built it together with our users and
developers like you.

00:59:26.760 --> 00:59:30.660
None of what we showed today would have been
possible without the journey of Chrome.

00:59:30.660 --> 00:59:35.640
We've put together a short video to recap
what the journey has been like with you all.

00:59:35.640 --> 00:59:38.750
So let's take a look.

00:59:38.750 --> 00:59:41.480
[ Video.

00:59:41.480 --> 00:59:58.410
]
&gt;&gt;&gt; Today I'm going to be talking to you about

00:59:58.410 --> 01:00:00.000
HTML5.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:36.290
Interesting aspects of the new standard.

01:00:36.290 --> 01:01:06.460
[ Music ]
&gt;&gt;&gt; Chrome has amazing frame rate capabilities.

01:01:06.460 --> 01:01:17.480
&gt;&gt;&gt; Frame rate capabilities.

01:01:17.480 --> 01:01:28.500
&gt;&gt;&gt; Frame rate capabilities.

01:01:28.500 --> 01:01:35.839
[ Video concludes.

01:01:35.839 --> 01:01:39.510
]
[ Applause ]

01:01:39.510 --> 01:02:03.839
&gt;&gt;Sundar Pichai: So it's been an exciting
journey, and we really need your help to do

01:02:03.839 --> 01:02:05.220
what's next.

01:02:05.220 --> 01:02:08.740
So we thought the best way to package all
the goodness you saw today and give it to

01:02:08.740 --> 01:02:13.040
all of you, and there's no better way for
us to do that than literally give you all

01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:17.549
a Chromebox, the brand-new Samsung Chromebox,
which, --

01:02:17.549 --> 01:02:25.890
[ Cheers and applause ]
&gt;&gt;Sundar Pichai: -- hopefully, you have some

01:02:25.890 --> 01:02:30.710
extra space in your Android developer pack
with -- in addition to the three devices.

01:02:30.710 --> 01:02:34.740
So the Web is entirely what you all make of
it.

01:02:34.740 --> 01:02:39.390
And we rely on the help of developers like
you to succeed in what we do and help users

01:02:39.390 --> 01:02:40.530
live online.

01:02:40.530 --> 01:02:44.480
So we hope you can continue to develop a lot
of great Web applications, and we will see

01:02:44.480 --> 01:02:45.480
you next year.

01:02:45.480 --> 01:02:46.790
Thank you.

01:02:46.790 --> 01:02:51.390
[ Cheers and applause ]

01:02:51.390 --> 01:02:56.000
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;&gt; You're on.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:02.140
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: We're live?

01:03:02.140 --> 01:03:03.950
We're a go?

01:03:03.950 --> 01:03:04.950
Okay.

01:03:04.950 --> 01:03:05.950
Hey, everybody.

01:03:05.950 --> 01:03:07.510
Welcome here to a beautiful, cool day in San
Francisco.

01:03:07.510 --> 01:03:10.330
We're on the roof of the Moscone center.

01:03:10.330 --> 01:03:13.349
I know we showed you something really special
yesterday.

01:03:13.349 --> 01:03:17.090
And we got so much interest that we wanted
to show you how we put it all together.

01:03:17.090 --> 01:03:22.260
And, actually, we wanted to show you some
of the pretty same exciting action that you

01:03:22.260 --> 01:03:26.000
saw, but from a new perspective this time.

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:27.460
So you can see, this is the roof.

01:03:27.460 --> 01:03:30.990
Some of our bikers are warming up out there.

01:03:30.990 --> 01:03:36.060
And they're doing some of their cool tricks,
getting ready for their part of this demonstration.

01:03:36.060 --> 01:03:40.650
You can also see that the airship is actually
overhead.

01:03:40.650 --> 01:03:41.650
It's pretty close to the sun.

01:03:41.650 --> 01:03:43.880
I don't know if we can get a camera on that.

01:03:43.880 --> 01:03:48.890
You might be able to see it through my view
through my Glass in the Hangout.

01:03:48.890 --> 01:03:54.520
And we actually have a number of the jumpers
in the Hangout now.

01:03:54.520 --> 01:04:00.740
Now, as I walk over here, you'll see that
it's actually tricky to keep them in the Hangout

01:04:00.740 --> 01:04:04.520
because of the really challenging wireless
environment.

01:04:04.520 --> 01:04:10.060
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: And if I can show you all on

01:04:10.060 --> 01:04:17.670
here, we're pointing each of these dishes,
using different kinds of RF technology for

01:04:17.670 --> 01:04:19.000
redundancy.

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:22.380
Each jumper has a different piece of technology
coming down.

01:04:22.380 --> 01:04:27.270
And that's how we felt comfortable that we
could maintain at least a couple of them in

01:04:27.270 --> 01:04:29.109
the Hangout.

01:04:29.109 --> 01:04:34.430
I'm also, by the way, testing out a new kind
of iteration of Glass with these shade clip-ins

01:04:34.430 --> 01:04:36.130
here right now.

01:04:36.130 --> 01:04:42.600
And they're -- definitely makes it better
out here in the bright sun.

01:04:42.600 --> 01:04:49.010
So we're going to have -- we've worked, you
know, with a lot of people around here, with

01:04:49.010 --> 01:04:55.540
the City of San Francisco, the FAA, and the
offices of Oakland and San Jose to make this

01:04:55.540 --> 01:04:56.540
happen.

01:04:56.540 --> 01:04:59.700
But the coordination is pretty tricky, as
you might imagine.

01:04:59.700 --> 01:05:01.900
Our jump master is here.

01:05:01.900 --> 01:05:02.900
This is marshal.

01:05:02.900 --> 01:05:04.089
Marshal, how far out are we?

01:05:04.089 --> 01:05:06.900
&gt;&gt;&gt; Under two minutes from the wing suits
being in the air.

01:05:06.900 --> 01:05:08.180
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: Under two minutes?

01:05:08.180 --> 01:05:10.820
That's super exciting.

01:05:10.820 --> 01:05:16.250
And you guys might be able to see their perspectives
right now in the Hangout live.

01:05:16.250 --> 01:05:18.210
This is pretty exciting to me.

01:05:18.210 --> 01:05:20.290
How's -- have you heard from J.T.?

01:05:20.290 --> 01:05:21.559
How are they doing up there?

01:05:21.559 --> 01:05:24.800
&gt;&gt;&gt; They're in position right now.

01:05:24.800 --> 01:05:29.660
They're going to hover a little while, open
the door, they're going to fly in their wing

01:05:29.660 --> 01:05:30.660
suits northwest of us here, deploy their parachutes.

01:05:30.660 --> 01:05:34.160
And then you and I will be out here and it
will be high fives and smiles when they land.

01:05:34.160 --> 01:05:35.160
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: Awesome.

01:05:35.160 --> 01:05:37.690
Since we only have a couple minutes, why don't
you guys walk with me.

01:05:37.690 --> 01:05:40.579
I want to get closer to their landing zone.

01:05:40.579 --> 01:05:47.550
And, you know, as we go here, I can just point
out, I mean, it's just stunning here.

01:05:47.550 --> 01:05:52.490
But if you look over there, as we walk toward
the landing zone, you can see a fog bank right

01:05:52.490 --> 01:05:54.119
over there.

01:05:54.119 --> 01:05:57.240
And that fog bank is actually very scary to
us.

01:05:57.240 --> 01:06:00.569
It seems to be clearing out, so we feel good
about the jump today.

01:06:00.569 --> 01:06:01.810
But there was no guarantee.

01:06:01.810 --> 01:06:08.910
And, in fact, I should note that skydiving,
you know, there's no such thing as instrument

01:06:08.910 --> 01:06:09.910
skydiving.

01:06:09.910 --> 01:06:11.150
You actually have to see your landing.

01:06:11.150 --> 01:06:15.170
I guess, conceivably, with Glass, you could
make an instrument version.

01:06:15.170 --> 01:06:17.450
You have a nice heads-up display where you're
going.

01:06:17.450 --> 01:06:19.720
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: But, anyway, we'll have to

01:06:19.720 --> 01:06:20.720
try that another time.

01:06:20.720 --> 01:06:22.270
I know, I'm scaring my jump master.

01:06:22.270 --> 01:06:24.849
Today, we have sunny skies.

01:06:24.849 --> 01:06:28.630
You can see -- there's the airship pretty
much straight overhead.

01:06:28.630 --> 01:06:31.240
I don't know if we can get -- maybe we'll
get another shot of that.

01:06:31.240 --> 01:06:34.780
We have a few cameras scattered here that
can show you that.

01:06:34.780 --> 01:06:38.680
And let's keep walking here.

01:06:38.680 --> 01:06:41.329
A lot of exciting action.

01:06:41.329 --> 01:06:52.560
Now, I don't want to -- I don't want to block
your view.

01:06:52.560 --> 01:06:56.180
Hopefully, the audience is seeing right now
-- how is our Hangout going?

01:06:56.180 --> 01:06:58.739
&gt;&gt;&gt; We're ready to go up to the airship.

01:06:58.739 --> 01:06:59.739
&gt;&gt;&gt; Okay.

01:06:59.739 --> 01:07:00.739
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: Okay.

01:07:00.739 --> 01:07:01.810
They're ready to jump.

01:07:01.810 --> 01:07:02.810
Cool.

01:07:02.810 --> 01:07:04.260
How's our view in the Hangout coming along?

01:07:04.260 --> 01:07:07.030
&gt;&gt;&gt; I think J.T. is ready.

01:07:07.030 --> 01:07:08.380
Go up to J.T.

01:07:08.380 --> 01:07:09.380
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: Okay.

01:07:09.380 --> 01:07:10.380
That's so cool.

01:07:10.380 --> 01:07:12.710
Why don't we throw it up to J.T. and he can
take it away.

01:07:12.710 --> 01:07:15.720
And, hopefully, this Hangout will go as well
as yesterday did.

01:07:15.720 --> 01:07:16.839
But, you know, you never know.

01:07:16.839 --> 01:07:18.079
A million things can go wrong.

01:07:18.079 --> 01:07:19.310
Okay, take it away, J.T.

01:07:19.310 --> 01:07:20.310
&gt;&gt;&gt; Yeah.

01:07:20.310 --> 01:07:21.320
Good to be here, Terry.

01:07:21.320 --> 01:07:22.980
Yeah, lucky with that fog.

01:07:22.980 --> 01:07:28.480
Good job calling ahead on that one, Sergey,
having it kind of just push away.

01:07:28.480 --> 01:07:29.480
Perfect.

01:07:29.480 --> 01:07:30.480
&gt;&gt;&gt; It's obviously high up.

01:07:30.480 --> 01:07:41.290
It's kind of hard to spot from here if the
door is open.

01:07:41.290 --> 01:07:43.930
They'll be slowing down and hovering right
before they exit the aircraft.

01:07:43.930 --> 01:07:45.150
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: Okay, okay.

01:07:45.150 --> 01:07:46.150
&gt;&gt;&gt; A ten-second countdown.

01:07:46.150 --> 01:07:47.150
We'll be able to watch the whole show.

01:07:47.150 --> 01:07:48.150
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: That's exciting.

01:07:48.150 --> 01:07:50.020
Thank you so much, Marshal.

01:07:50.020 --> 01:07:53.970
&gt;&gt;&gt; Beautiful day for this.

01:07:53.970 --> 01:08:02.349
Earlier, when we had the clouds, it was --
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: That was definitely touch and

01:08:02.349 --> 01:08:03.349
go.

01:08:03.349 --> 01:08:05.780
And, you know, I'm so excited about today.

01:08:05.780 --> 01:08:07.220
Yesterday was really fun.

01:08:07.220 --> 01:08:08.500
But I was down in the auditorium.

01:08:08.500 --> 01:08:16.130
And, by the way, for those of you who are
actually watching at I/O, you can see it from

01:08:16.130 --> 01:08:17.890
the lobby.

01:08:17.890 --> 01:08:22.002
You might not be able to see quite the skydiver
angle, but you'll be able to see some of the

01:08:22.002 --> 01:08:24.359
other activity that we have.

01:08:24.359 --> 01:08:27.880
For those of you who are in downtown San Francisco,
this would probably be a good time to peek

01:08:27.880 --> 01:08:30.940
out your windows.

01:08:30.940 --> 01:08:36.150
Do you know if the door is open?

01:08:36.150 --> 01:08:45.679
Maybe I'll --
&gt;&gt;&gt; Are you guys ready for us?

01:08:45.679 --> 01:08:48.559
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: Okay.

01:08:48.559 --> 01:08:51.449
They are ready.

01:08:51.449 --> 01:08:55.299
&gt;&gt;&gt; Sergey, the door (inaudible).

01:08:55.299 --> 01:08:58.179
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: Okay.

01:08:58.179 --> 01:09:00.109
All right.

01:09:00.109 --> 01:09:05.749
So we're about to -- we're going to see them,
actually, from the door here.

01:09:05.749 --> 01:09:10.250
You'll have -- you'll be seeing the first
person shot of them exiting.

01:09:10.250 --> 01:09:14.599
For those of you in San Francisco who are
looking from the Moscone area, it's the back

01:09:14.599 --> 01:09:24.409
door on the port side of the ship.

01:09:24.409 --> 01:09:29.289
We should get a countdown momentarily.

01:09:29.289 --> 01:09:30.949
They're hovering.

01:09:30.949 --> 01:09:38.179
You can see they're pretty much right over
the intercontinental hotel.

01:09:38.179 --> 01:09:44.949
And Marshal, who's going to run the countdown?

01:09:44.949 --> 01:09:51.650
Neal, on the airship is going to be counting
down.

01:09:51.650 --> 01:09:53.459
The door is open.

01:09:53.459 --> 01:09:55.510
&gt;&gt;&gt; Good morning, San Francisco!

01:09:55.510 --> 01:10:00.000
Hey, how are the winds doing down there?

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:01.480
All right.

01:10:01.480 --> 01:10:04.170
Well, we're going for it.

01:10:04.170 --> 01:10:05.170
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: Okay.

01:10:05.170 --> 01:10:06.170
We've got 30 seconds, everyone.

01:10:06.170 --> 01:10:07.170
I'm super excited about this.

01:10:07.170 --> 01:10:08.170
&gt;&gt;&gt; See you in a few.

01:10:11.389 --> 01:10:12.880
It's a beautiful day.

01:10:12.880 --> 01:10:16.230
We're really lucking out that the fog is holding
back.

Door is open.

01:10:23.139 --> 01:10:26.160
God, that --
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: That must be a beautiful feeling

01:10:26.160 --> 01:10:33.809
to just fly right out of there.

01:10:33.809 --> 01:10:39.670
&gt;&gt;&gt; Five, four, three -- one!

01:10:39.670 --> 01:10:42.590
&gt;&gt;&gt; Jumping away.

01:10:42.590 --> 01:10:49.909

01:10:49.909 --> 01:10:54.300
There they are!

01:10:54.300 --> 01:10:57.369
You can see them flying.

01:10:58.369 --> 01:10:59.369

01:10:59.369 --> 01:11:00.369
Look at that.

01:11:00.369 --> 01:11:01.369
They're weaving closely in and out of each
other.

01:11:01.369 --> 01:11:02.369
The Hangout footage, I'm sorry, I don't have
it.

01:11:02.369 --> 01:11:03.369
It must be beautiful.

01:11:03.369 --> 01:11:06.300
Their chutes are opening.

01:11:06.300 --> 01:11:08.389
We've got two chutes open.

01:11:08.389 --> 01:11:12.079
And the third one, with a puff of smoke, just
opened.

01:11:12.079 --> 01:11:18.650
If you're wondering why, we had to put one
of them with a puff of smoke so the radio-aiming

01:11:18.650 --> 01:11:22.840
folks could know which skydiver was theirs.

01:11:22.840 --> 01:11:27.090
&gt;&gt;&gt; Walk over here and get -- we'll try to
get (indiscernible) as they land.

01:11:27.090 --> 01:11:31.620
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: Yes, if we can get over this
way pretty quick, and, hopefully, you guys

01:11:31.620 --> 01:11:37.110
can tag along.

01:11:37.110 --> 01:11:42.610
Okay, bikers ready.

01:11:42.610 --> 01:11:45.630
You can see we're getting ready.

01:11:45.630 --> 01:11:46.959
Skydivers coming down.

01:11:46.959 --> 01:11:48.719
All right.

01:11:48.719 --> 01:11:50.959
Where should I stand here?

01:11:50.959 --> 01:11:55.380
&gt;&gt;&gt; Going to land right --
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: Okay.

01:11:55.380 --> 01:12:07.170
You can see them clearly.

01:12:07.170 --> 01:12:31.989
You can now --
&gt;&gt;&gt; Give us 30 feet or so.

01:12:31.989 --> 01:12:35.089
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: All right.

01:12:35.089 --> 01:12:36.089
&gt;&gt;&gt; Step right over here.

01:12:36.089 --> 01:12:37.089
They're going to be landing, coming towards
us.

01:12:37.089 --> 01:12:38.089
&gt;&gt;&gt; Here comes J.T. right here.

01:12:38.089 --> 01:12:39.089
&gt;&gt;&gt; All right.

01:12:39.089 --> 01:12:40.089
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: Woo-hoo!

01:12:40.089 --> 01:12:41.089
[ Cheers and applause ]
&gt;&gt;&gt; Yeah, buddy.

01:12:41.089 --> 01:12:42.089
Yeah, all right!

01:12:43.089 --> 01:12:44.089
&gt;&gt;&gt; Whoa all right!

01:12:44.089 --> 01:12:45.089
Nice!

01:12:45.089 --> 01:12:46.089
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: That was awesome.

01:12:46.089 --> 01:12:47.089
&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks for having us.

01:12:47.089 --> 01:12:48.089
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: Thanks for coming down.

01:12:48.089 --> 01:12:49.089
All right.

01:12:49.089 --> 01:12:50.089
That was amazing.

01:12:50.089 --> 01:12:51.089
&gt;&gt;&gt; Good job.

01:12:51.089 --> 01:12:52.089
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: All of our jumpers are down.

01:12:52.089 --> 01:12:53.089
And they make it look so easy.

01:12:53.089 --> 01:12:54.089
All right.

01:12:54.089 --> 01:12:55.089
Don't get blown away here.

01:12:55.089 --> 01:12:56.089
Hey, hey, that was great.

01:12:56.089 --> 01:12:57.089
Thanks, again.

01:12:57.089 --> 01:12:58.089
Amazing jump.

01:12:58.089 --> 01:12:59.089
Thanks, guys.

01:12:59.089 --> 01:13:00.089
&gt;&gt;&gt; (indiscernible).

01:13:00.089 --> 01:13:01.089
&gt;&gt;&gt; That was awesome.

01:13:01.089 --> 01:13:02.089
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: Great job.

01:13:02.089 --> 01:13:03.089
All right, thanks, guys, so much.

01:13:03.089 --> 01:13:05.780
Now, don't forget, we tested -- that was an
amazing jump.

01:13:05.780 --> 01:13:09.179
We have more in store to show you just how
did we do it.

01:13:09.179 --> 01:13:11.019
We have our excellent bikers here.

01:13:11.019 --> 01:13:14.480
And this is a really fun area here.

01:13:14.480 --> 01:13:16.310
There are a few kind of natural blocks and
things.

01:13:16.310 --> 01:13:21.440
But the killer thing that we put in there,
because the roof goes up and down, there's

01:13:21.440 --> 01:13:23.439
a really great ramp that we put in there.

01:13:23.439 --> 01:13:26.269
And that was where you saw that magical moment.

01:13:26.269 --> 01:13:32.010
So maybe we can actually get a chance to see
the bikers -- let's see what you guys got!

01:13:32.010 --> 01:13:39.860
Why don't you hit the ramp.

01:13:39.860 --> 01:13:42.469
All right.

01:13:42.469 --> 01:13:49.219
And we're going to try to make our way so
we can first of all watch this.

01:13:49.219 --> 01:13:50.219
Watch this.

01:13:50.219 --> 01:13:51.219
Yeah!

01:13:51.219 --> 01:13:52.729
Whoa, another back flip.

01:13:52.729 --> 01:13:54.340
That was amazing.

01:13:54.340 --> 01:13:56.300
All right.

01:13:56.300 --> 01:14:00.130
We're going to head over now and try to catch
them on the other side.

01:14:00.130 --> 01:14:04.840
The roof goes, actually, up, and then there's
the giant dropoff on the other side.

01:14:04.840 --> 01:14:07.409
Yesterday, they cruised right through that.

01:14:07.409 --> 01:14:11.360
But today, we're going to get ourselves time
to get over there so we can have a really

01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:13.170
nice view.

01:14:13.170 --> 01:14:14.869
So please follow along.

01:14:14.869 --> 01:14:24.139
Now, we're going to have to go through some
of the deep, dark, cavernous parts of the

01:14:24.139 --> 01:14:25.380
building.

01:14:25.380 --> 01:14:30.190
And we're going to try to hustle there and
get there pretty quick.

01:14:30.190 --> 01:14:32.039
Oh.

01:14:32.039 --> 01:14:39.139
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: And okay, this time today,

01:14:39.139 --> 01:14:43.449
because we're not in such a hurry, the bikers
are going to wait for us.

01:14:43.449 --> 01:14:50.079
If you haven't seen the inside of Moscone,
it's a pretty exciting sight.

01:14:50.079 --> 01:15:04.960
So let's make our way through.

01:15:04.960 --> 01:15:06.590
So are we keeping running right now?

01:15:06.590 --> 01:15:07.590
Okay.

01:15:07.590 --> 01:15:09.289
But --
&gt;&gt;&gt; We can all the way through.

01:15:09.289 --> 01:15:11.420
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: Okay.

01:15:11.420 --> 01:15:12.830
(Radio communication).

01:15:12.830 --> 01:15:14.959
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: Okay.

01:15:14.959 --> 01:15:18.929
I don't know if you guys can follow here.

01:15:18.929 --> 01:15:26.619
I'm going to unclip my shades now so I can
see a little bit better.

01:15:26.619 --> 01:15:34.789
And this is just a portion of all the equipment
that powers this building.

01:15:34.789 --> 01:15:38.150
We actually -- when we were talking about
this originally, we looked at having people

01:15:38.150 --> 01:15:51.449
bike and jump up and down through here.

01:15:51.449 --> 01:15:53.119
Okay.

01:15:53.119 --> 01:15:54.860
I'm going to -- oh, thank you.

01:15:54.860 --> 01:15:55.860
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:15:55.860 --> 01:15:56.909
These might work a little bit better for me.

01:15:56.909 --> 01:16:04.170
I'm going to click my -- these shade clip-ins
to this other pair of glasses here and just

01:16:04.170 --> 01:16:07.619
-- it's a little accessory that we're working
on.

01:16:07.619 --> 01:16:11.530
And it's pretty nice on a bright day like
this.

01:16:11.530 --> 01:16:13.219
So here we are.

01:16:13.219 --> 01:16:17.210
And -- actually, it's kind of cool, because
I don't know if you guys can see me right

01:16:17.210 --> 01:16:18.210
now.

01:16:18.210 --> 01:16:20.159
I'm now in a Hangout.

01:16:20.159 --> 01:16:22.889
Back on the other side, had a little bit of
issues keeping me in the Hangout.

01:16:22.889 --> 01:16:26.420
But here it's working nicely.

01:16:26.420 --> 01:16:30.909
And here we can make our way, we can check
this out.

01:16:30.909 --> 01:16:37.290
Maybe we'll -- if you guys can follow along
with me, we can see the bikers are right up

01:16:37.290 --> 01:16:38.290
there.

01:16:38.290 --> 01:16:40.820
It's a really big drop, actually.

01:16:40.820 --> 01:16:41.820
It's a really big drop.

01:16:41.820 --> 01:16:43.150
I'm going to duck under here.

01:16:43.150 --> 01:16:49.699
And it's a -- I mean, I know they make it
look easy.

01:16:49.699 --> 01:16:52.550
But they're probably, what, 15 feet up there?

01:16:52.550 --> 01:16:58.050
And they're going to just show us how they
get down off that big ramp.

01:16:58.050 --> 01:16:59.949
All right, guys.

01:16:59.949 --> 01:17:02.489
Let's see you go.

01:17:02.489 --> 01:17:04.389
&gt;&gt;&gt; Go, go, go!

01:17:04.389 --> 01:17:09.179

01:17:16.239 --> 01:17:30.349
See you down there.

got three, actually.

01:17:43.309 --> 01:17:44.800
And it's a long way down.

01:17:44.800 --> 01:17:46.229
It's a long way down.

01:17:46.229 --> 01:17:50.969
I'm actually going to take off my Glass so
you can see this.

01:17:50.969 --> 01:17:53.550
Okay.

01:17:53.550 --> 01:18:16.780

and sound.

and catch up with you.

Thank you, all, for watching.

I know we have a lot of interest.

01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:47.929
And we just wanted to show for the people
who just, you know, heard about it just yesterday,

01:18:47.929 --> 01:18:53.479
want to show you about something that it took
and actually show you some of that amazing

01:18:53.479 --> 01:18:54.479

01:18:54.479 --> 01:18:55.479

Well, we'll keep you abreast of our progress
on Glass.

01:19:00.599 --> 01:19:06.159
This is just one of the exciting things that
we've had the privilege of working on and

01:19:06.159 --> 01:19:10.189

something really exciting going forward.
