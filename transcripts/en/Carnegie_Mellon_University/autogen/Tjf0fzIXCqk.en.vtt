our research is really trying to

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:50.310
our research is really trying to
 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:53.450
our research is really trying to
understand a very basic question about

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460
understand a very basic question about
 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.250
understand a very basic question about
how the brain learns how do we learn

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260
how the brain learns how do we learn
 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.550
how the brain learns how do we learn
from a moment-to-moment experiences and

00:00:58.550 --> 00:00:58.560
from a moment-to-moment experiences and
 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.860
from a moment-to-moment experiences and
how do certain parts of the way that

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870
how do certain parts of the way that
 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.140
how do certain parts of the way that
we're wired together make us better or

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:03.150
we're wired together make us better or
 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.490
we're wired together make us better or
worse at learning you can understand

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.500
worse at learning you can understand
 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.480
worse at learning you can understand
individual differences and this learning

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490
individual differences and this learning
 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:09.830
individual differences and this learning
ability if you understand the way the

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840
ability if you understand the way the
 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.719
ability if you understand the way the
system is put together and that's where

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729
system is put together and that's where
 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.300

we kind of hoping to push this the most

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:13.310
we kind of hoping to push this the most
 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.550
we kind of hoping to push this the most
so right now what we're doing is we're

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560
so right now what we're doing is we're
 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.160
so right now what we're doing is we're
using a form of magnetic resonance

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170
using a form of magnetic resonance
 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.300
using a form of magnetic resonance
imaging called diffusion-weighted

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310
imaging called diffusion-weighted
 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.700

imaging to map out the physical

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710
imaging to map out the physical
 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.190
imaging to map out the physical
connections in the human brain and what

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200
connections in the human brain and what
 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.050
connections in the human brain and what
we're looking at is the large super

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060
we're looking at is the large super
 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.940
we're looking at is the large super
highways that connect different areas

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950
highways that connect different areas
 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.859
highways that connect different areas
together and by mapping out these

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869
together and by mapping out these
 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.270
together and by mapping out these
connections what we essentially get is a

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280
connections what we essentially get is a
 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.569
connections what we essentially get is a

wiring diagram of the human brain now in
 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:36.859
wiring diagram of the human brain now in
the lab what we're interested in is

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869
the lab what we're interested in is
 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.739
the lab what we're interested in is
using this wiring diagram to understand

00:01:39.739 --> 00:01:39.749
using this wiring diagram to understand
 

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:42.709
using this wiring diagram to understand
how we make very basic decisions we're

00:01:42.709 --> 00:01:42.719
how we make very basic decisions we're
 

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:45.230
how we make very basic decisions we're
also looking at how particular set of

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240
also looking at how particular set of
 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.669
also looking at how particular set of
circuits the brain called the cortical

00:01:46.669 --> 00:01:46.679
circuits the brain called the cortical
 

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:49.039
circuits the brain called the cortical
basal ganglia circuits allow for us to

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049
basal ganglia circuits allow for us to
 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.529
basal ganglia circuits allow for us to
learn very complex skills you acquire

00:01:51.529 --> 00:01:51.539
learn very complex skills you acquire
 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:53.749
learn very complex skills you acquire
these skills of our very long times go

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759
these skills of our very long times go
 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.450
these skills of our very long times go
so we're looking at this this form of

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460
so we're looking at this this form of
 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.520
so we're looking at this this form of

that are involved and in particular what

00:02:01.099 --> 00:02:01.109
that are involved and in particular what
 

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:03.139

we want to know is does little

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149
we want to know is does little
 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.789
we want to know is does little
