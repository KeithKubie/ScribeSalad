have significance but it depended upon
 

00:12:06.669 --> 00:12:09.779
have significance but it depended upon
finding more data now there were there

00:12:09.779 --> 00:12:09.789
finding more data now there were there
 

00:12:09.789 --> 00:12:10.919
finding more data now there were there
weren't going to be more data from the

weren't going to be more data from the
 

00:12:10.929 --> 00:12:15.869
weren't going to be more data from the
Chronicles and so the data emerged five

looked at tree rings from western

00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:41.870
looked at tree rings from western
 

00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:46.000
looked at tree rings from western
mongolia and found that there was indeed

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:46.010
mongolia and found that there was indeed
 

00:12:46.010 --> 00:12:48.160
mongolia and found that there was indeed
a period of about a hundred and

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:48.170
a period of about a hundred and
 

00:12:48.170 --> 00:12:51.060
a period of about a hundred and
thirty-five cold years there was a cold

00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:51.070
thirty-five cold years there was a cold
 

00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:55.290
thirty-five cold years there was a cold
period that shows up in western mongolia

00:12:55.290 --> 00:12:55.300
period that shows up in western mongolia
 

00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:59.440
period that shows up in western mongolia
now the significance of of that since

00:12:59.440 --> 00:12:59.450
now the significance of of that since
 

00:12:59.450 --> 00:13:00.850
now the significance of of that since
western mongolia is a long way from

ones that come off the Mediterranean do
 

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:25.170
ones that come off the Mediterranean do
bring moisture these

00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:28.980
these storm tracks of the winter will

00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:28.990
these storm tracks of the winter will
 

00:14:28.990 --> 00:14:31.620
these storm tracks of the winter will
vary there are some periods when they're

00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:31.630
vary there are some periods when they're
 

00:14:31.630 --> 00:14:35.540
vary there are some periods when they're
farther to the north and then you get

00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:35.550
farther to the north and then you get
 

00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:40.410
farther to the north and then you get
bad matures in the North Sea in Holland

00:14:40.410 --> 00:14:40.420
bad matures in the North Sea in Holland
 

00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:44.850
bad matures in the North Sea in Holland
or Denmark or British Isles something

00:14:44.850 --> 00:14:44.860
or Denmark or British Isles something
 

00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:48.500
or Denmark or British Isles something
like that there is an approximately an

00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:48.510
like that there is an approximately an
 

00:14:48.510 --> 00:14:54.240
like that there is an approximately an
11 year oscillation known as the North

00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:54.250
11 year oscillation known as the North
 

00:14:54.250 --> 00:14:57.860
11 year oscillation known as the North
Atlantic Oscillation so that you have

00:14:57.860 --> 00:14:57.870
Atlantic Oscillation so that you have
 

00:14:57.870 --> 00:15:02.700
Atlantic Oscillation so that you have
the pressure gradients out here in the

00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:02.710
the pressure gradients out here in the
 

00:15:02.710 --> 00:15:05.970
the pressure gradients out here in the
Atlantic between the Azores and say

00:15:05.970 --> 00:15:05.980
Atlantic between the Azores and say
 

00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:09.000
Atlantic between the Azores and say
Iceland that pressure gradient will

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:09.010
Iceland that pressure gradient will
 

00:15:09.010 --> 00:15:12.060
Iceland that pressure gradient will
change on this sort of regular quasi

00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:12.070
change on this sort of regular quasi
 

00:15:12.070 --> 00:15:14.460
change on this sort of regular quasi
regular basis and this is going to push

00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:14.470
regular basis and this is going to push
 

00:15:14.470 --> 00:15:16.140
regular basis and this is going to push
the storm tracks north or push them

00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:16.150
the storm tracks north or push them
 

00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:16.800
the storm tracks north or push them
south

00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:16.810
south
 

00:15:16.810 --> 00:15:20.820
south
so you have periodic droughts in the

00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:20.830
so you have periodic droughts in the
 

00:15:20.830 --> 00:15:21.930
so you have periodic droughts in the
Middle East that are actually fairly

00:15:21.930 --> 00:15:21.940
Middle East that are actually fairly
 

00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:27.440
Middle East that are actually fairly
predictable say a country like Syria

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:27.450
 

00:15:27.450 --> 00:15:30.570
will go through a period of years when

00:15:30.570 --> 00:15:30.580
will go through a period of years when
 

00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:32.910
will go through a period of years when
they have plenty of rain for growing

00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:32.920
they have plenty of rain for growing
 

00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:35.400
they have plenty of rain for growing
grain and then a period of years when

00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:35.410
grain and then a period of years when
 

00:15:35.410 --> 00:15:37.740
grain and then a period of years when
they're like right now when they are

00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:37.750
they're like right now when they are
 

00:15:37.750 --> 00:15:41.100
they're like right now when they are
suffering severe drought and the

00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:41.110
suffering severe drought and the
 

00:15:41.110 --> 00:15:43.950
suffering severe drought and the
oscillation you know is used to predict

00:15:43.950 --> 00:15:43.960
oscillation you know is used to predict
 

00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:46.080
oscillation you know is used to predict
them you know the rains will return once

00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:46.090
them you know the rains will return once
 

00:15:46.090 --> 00:15:48.900
them you know the rains will return once
the oscillation resolves in the other

00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:48.910
the oscillation resolves in the other
 

00:15:48.910 --> 00:15:52.560
the oscillation resolves in the other
direction okay that that is if you read

00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:52.570
direction okay that that is if you read
 

00:15:52.570 --> 00:15:54.090
direction okay that that is if you read
general history books on the Middle East

00:15:54.090 --> 00:15:54.100
general history books on the Middle East
 

00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:57.450
general history books on the Middle East
or geography books they will say this is

00:15:57.450 --> 00:15:57.460
or geography books they will say this is
 

00:15:57.460 --> 00:16:03.270
or geography books they will say this is
your your your rainfall pattern now once

00:16:03.270 --> 00:16:03.280
your your your rainfall pattern now once
 

00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:04.260
your your your rainfall pattern now once
you get to the north

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:04.270
you get to the north
 

00:16:04.270 --> 00:16:09.840
you get to the north
Oh farther out here and say here's the

00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:09.850
Oh farther out here and say here's the
 

00:16:09.850 --> 00:16:13.260
Oh farther out here and say here's the
Black Sea here's the Caspian Sea and

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:13.270
Black Sea here's the Caspian Sea and
 

00:16:13.270 --> 00:16:15.900
Black Sea here's the Caspian Sea and
here's Central Asian and here's Mongolia

00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:15.910
here's Central Asian and here's Mongolia
 

00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:20.580
here's Central Asian and here's Mongolia
over here what you have out out here

00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:20.590
over here what you have out out here
 

00:16:20.590 --> 00:16:24.879
over here what you have out out here
every winter is

00:16:24.879 --> 00:16:24.889
every winter is
 

00:16:24.889 --> 00:16:28.449
every winter is
a big high-pressure area it's called the

00:16:28.449 --> 00:16:28.459
a big high-pressure area it's called the
 

00:16:28.459 --> 00:16:32.559
a big high-pressure area it's called the
Siberian high it's in Siberia or western

00:16:32.559 --> 00:16:32.569
Siberian high it's in Siberia or western
 

00:16:32.569 --> 00:16:36.160
Siberian high it's in Siberia or western
mongolia or eastern kazakhstan you know

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:36.170
mongolia or eastern kazakhstan you know
 

00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:38.259
mongolia or eastern kazakhstan you know
where the exact center is is not

00:16:38.259 --> 00:16:38.269
where the exact center is is not
 

00:16:38.269 --> 00:16:43.599
where the exact center is is not
terribly important around this you know

00:16:43.599 --> 00:16:43.609
terribly important around this you know
 

00:16:43.609 --> 00:16:49.869
terribly important around this you know
of a broad circulation of air that that

00:16:49.869 --> 00:16:49.879
of a broad circulation of air that that
 

00:16:49.879 --> 00:16:53.199
of a broad circulation of air that that
brings cold weather across Central Asia

00:16:53.199 --> 00:16:53.209
brings cold weather across Central Asia
 

00:16:53.209 --> 00:16:57.359
brings cold weather across Central Asia
and Central Asia is indeed very frigid

00:16:57.359 --> 00:16:57.369
and Central Asia is indeed very frigid
 

00:16:57.369 --> 00:17:02.309
and Central Asia is indeed very frigid
that cold air is running into these

00:17:02.309 --> 00:17:02.319
that cold air is running into these
 

00:17:02.319 --> 00:17:05.470
that cold air is running into these
storm tracks from Mediterranean so in

00:17:05.470 --> 00:17:05.480
storm tracks from Mediterranean so in
 

00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:09.850
storm tracks from Mediterranean so in
other words these are low pressures low

00:17:09.850 --> 00:17:09.860
other words these are low pressures low
 

00:17:09.860 --> 00:17:11.559
other words these are low pressures low
pressure systems and are coming off the

00:17:11.559 --> 00:17:11.569
pressure systems and are coming off the
 

00:17:11.569 --> 00:17:13.929
pressure systems and are coming off the
Mediterranean but this is high pressure

00:17:13.929 --> 00:17:13.939
Mediterranean but this is high pressure
 

00:17:13.939 --> 00:17:24.720
Mediterranean but this is high pressure
and they don't really penetrate here so

00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:24.730
 

00:17:24.730 --> 00:17:30.820
you get so fall in high areas in Iran

00:17:30.820 --> 00:17:30.830
you get so fall in high areas in Iran
 

00:17:30.830 --> 00:17:36.549

nobody else has noticed it and so I
