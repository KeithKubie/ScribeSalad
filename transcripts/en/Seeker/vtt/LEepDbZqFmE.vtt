00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:05.300
Over the last several decades, we’ve poured
billions of dollars into biofuel research...so

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:08.820
why can’t you fill up with it at the gas
station yet?

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.410
Where are the biofuels?!

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.510
After all, the gas you put in your car is
essentially an ancient biofuel: it used to

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:20.949
be organic matter—mostly algae, actually—that
over millions of years was compressed within

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:24.160
the earth into fuel, hence the term fossil
fuel.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.859
It consists of hydrocarbons, which we can
burn, breaking those bonds to release energy

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.050
that powers stuff, like our cars.

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.340
So surely in this age of modern science, we
can engineer new fuels out of those same raw

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:37.450
materials, right?

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:39.680
Turns out—not so simple.

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:45.969
See, the idea behind biofuels is that we use
organic matter, like straw or corn or sugarcane,

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:47.870
and turn it into liquid fuel.

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.739
Ideally, the gases that are released when
we burn that fuel are equivalent to the emissions

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.500
that are absorbed by growing them in the first
place, so the whole cycle is what we call

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.810
‘carbon neutral’—it produces zero net
emissions.

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:04.019
Plus, we won’t run out of them, because
we can just grow more.

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.709
That’s why biofuels are so attractive.

00:01:06.709 --> 00:01:12.819
We could have energy security and reduce emissions,
even create whole new agricultural sectors.

00:01:12.819 --> 00:01:18.219
But the amount of energy that’s packed into
really potent fossil fuel is pretty hard to

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:19.219
rival.

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:21.619
Take ethanol, a common first generation biofuel.

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:26.770
It’s an alcohol, which requires plant biomass
to be fermented, distilled, and dehydrated

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.109
to take it from the crop we grow in the field
to what you put in your tank.

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:35.779
In the U.S., for example, we’ve mostly used
corn, and just growing it in the first place

00:01:35.779 --> 00:01:42.979
requires intensive resources—not just energy,
but land, water, fertilizer that causes pollution—and

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:46.249
growing corn for ethanol can directly compete
with food production.

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:51.939
After growing it, we have to process the raw
corn into fuel—this is time, money, and

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:53.119
energy expensive.

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:57.759
Plus, actually putting ethanol in cars is
a bit of a stumbling block.

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:02.110
In general, if we want to use different fuel,
we’ll have to change the way we make most

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.159
cars, especially in the U.S.

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:09.110
And ultimately, creating ethanol is so resource
intensive, these fuel products can actually

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.830
end up producing even more emissions than
fossil fuels throughout their lifetime!

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.150
Scientists have recognized these failures
in recent years and have developed more efficient,

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:23.900
second generation ethanols out of cellulosic
material, the denser, inedible parts of crops.

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.590
This doesn’t compete with existing food
pipelines and actually results in more energy

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:28.599
payoff.

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:33.760
But the distillation process remains expensive
and energy intensive--it may be more energy

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.930
dense material, but it’s also harder to
break down into fuel in the first place.

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:42.120
Brazil has had more success with sugarcane
ethanol production, but all ethanols still

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.430
have yet to break even in terms of practical,
widely-used energy parity.

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.810
Ok, but ethanol’s not the only biofuel out
there.

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:55.400
We also make biofuel out of algae, which--again--involves
cultivating and harvesting these microorganisms,

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.450
then putting them through an energy-intensive
process that squeezes those lipids out of

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:00.790
the algae cells.

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.060
We then refine those oils, and turn them into
fuel.

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.299
Same kind of problems here as with ethanol—we
haven’t been able to turn this process into

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:13.430
something that, on the whole, creates less
emissions AND is less expensive than regular

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.490
fuel because of all the resources that go
into processing it.

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:21.090
Plus--these organisms are plagued by predators
in large cultivation ponds, and keeping them

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.980
alive in industrial quantities is tough...but
lots of cool research is going into fixing

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:27.450
these particular problems.

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:33.280
What if we took an already processed food
by-product, like used french fry grease, and

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:34.280
used it as fuel?

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:39.290
We just need to refine it a bit, through a
process called transesterification, into something

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:41.359
call hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO).

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:46.730
This can and has been used to fuel large cargo
ships, and produces less carbon dioxide and

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:51.790
polluting particulates than the traditional
fuel for these large, energy-intensive vehicles.

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.930
These materials are more energy rich than
first gen biofuels like pure ethanol--but,

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.489
you guessed it, the conversion process is
still really expensive.

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:04.709
And biofuel like this works primarily with
diesel engines, which aren’t as common in

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:07.569
some places around the world, like in the
U.S..

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:12.329
In some places like Sweden however, HVO already
makes up a vast majority of their biofuel,

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:16.400
and biofuel in general makes up about a fifth
of their transport fuel sources.

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.130
So it is a promising contender.

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:23.009
We’ve been trying to make biofuel work commercially
since the early 1900s.

00:04:23.009 --> 00:04:26.830
And we’re still not there yet, but we are
innovating.

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:30.949
Scientists are now genetically editing plants
to make them produce more of the fatty oil

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:35.639
we use to make the fuel, hopefully allowing
us to get a higher energy yield from the resources

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:38.210
we put into cultivating that organism.

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:42.949
And some experts think that even as the market
shifts toward electrifying cars and trucks

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:48.210
on the road, biofuel is still a valid option
for powering big, pollution-heavy vehicles

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:50.840
like container ships and airplanes.

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:54.979
Maybe the real problem is how we’ve been
talking about all this--everyone wants to

00:04:54.979 --> 00:05:00.199
hype biofuel as the thing that’s going to
save the world, but we’re still on the journey.

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:03.330
Hopefully we won’t give up quite yet because
there’s really exciting technology in the

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:06.949
pipeline that could get us there, and that
needs support.

00:05:06.949 --> 00:05:11.650
But the clock is ticking and it feels like
time, and patience, is running out.

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:13.389
What do you think about biofuels?

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:16.460
Still promising, or will something else beat
green fuel to the road?
