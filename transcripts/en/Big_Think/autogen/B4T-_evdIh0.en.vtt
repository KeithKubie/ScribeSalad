everything but I think people should be
 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.690
everything but I think people should be
somewhat literate in science they should

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700
somewhat literate in science they should
 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.310
somewhat literate in science they should
be able to you know tell you something

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320
be able to you know tell you something
 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.649
be able to you know tell you something

define what it is and what it does you

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990
define what it is and what it does you
 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.560

know know what a mutation is know the

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570
know know what a mutation is know the
 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.230
know know what a mutation is know the
basics of Medicine the diseases that you

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240
basics of Medicine the diseases that you
 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.789
basics of Medicine the diseases that you
come down with they're the most people

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799
come down with they're the most people
 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.410
come down with they're the most people
will come down with and and how they

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420
will come down with and and how they
 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.450
will come down with and and how they
work so that you can keep on the lookout

basic level of scientific literacy is

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930
basic level of scientific literacy is
 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.719
basic level of scientific literacy is
simply necessary in the same way that

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729

you know we learn to do addition and

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320
you know we learn to do addition and
 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.719
you know we learn to do addition and
subtraction we can balance our

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729

checkbooks I mean to me these are just

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500
checkbooks I mean to me these are just
 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.980
checkbooks I mean to me these are just
basic everyday things that every citizen

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990
basic everyday things that every citizen
 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.380
basic everyday things that every citizen
needs to be aware of in part because of

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390
needs to be aware of in part because of
 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.999
needs to be aware of in part because of
that incredible pace of change in the

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009
that incredible pace of change in the
 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.069
that incredible pace of change in the
moment and the idea that science is

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079
moment and the idea that science is
 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.289
moment and the idea that science is
becoming so powerful now that the debate

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299
becoming so powerful now that the debate
 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.480
becoming so powerful now that the debate
is really not about can we do this

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490
is really not about can we do this
 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.789
is really not about can we do this
anymore it's more about should we do

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799
anymore it's more about should we do
 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:01:59.149
anymore it's more about should we do
this

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159
this
 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.190
this
should we be making these choices

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200
should we be making these choices
 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.810
should we be making these choices
discovering these things using the

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820
discovering these things using the
 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.700
discovering these things using the
technology and this way or that way

these are broader social questions

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750
these are broader social questions

these are broader social questions
they're not simply things that should be

they're not simply things that should be
 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.190
they're not simply things that should be
left up to the scientists there's

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200
left up to the scientists there's
 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.230
left up to the scientists there's
something every citizen has a stake in

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240
something every citizen has a stake in

ethically modified foods do we want that

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370
ethically modified foods do we want that
 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.550
ethically modified foods do we want that
as a society you know there's a lot of

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560
as a society you know there's a lot of
 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:17.810
as a society you know there's a lot of
debate and I think there's a lot of

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820
debate and I think there's a lot of
 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:19.640
debate and I think there's a lot of
misinformation on both sides some people

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650
misinformation on both sides some people
 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:20.630
misinformation on both sides some people
who oppose it but don't really

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640
who oppose it but don't really
 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.520
who oppose it but don't really
understand it and people who you know

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530
understand it and people who you know
 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.050
understand it and people who you know
perhaps have a vested interest and think

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060
perhaps have a vested interest and think
 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.820
perhaps have a vested interest and think
that it's completely safe but it is a

that it's completely safe but it is a
 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.580
that it's completely safe but it is a
debate that we need to have as a society

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590
debate that we need to have as a society
 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.290
debate that we need to have as a society
and to have a debate you need to have

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300
and to have a debate you need to have
 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:31.850
and to have a debate you need to have
some background knowledge to be able to

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860
some background knowledge to be able to
 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.610
some background knowledge to be able to
