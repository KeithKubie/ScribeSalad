00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.820
We're asked to find the
product 2x plus 8

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:06.450
times 2x minus 8.

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:07.700
So there's two ways to do it.

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:09.840
We can just multiply it out like
we've always done, but

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.550
this is actually a
special pattern.

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.420
This is a special pattern, where
we have an a plus a b,

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.380
where a in this case
is 2x and b is 8.

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.590
And we have that being
multiplied by a minus b,

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.820
where, once again, a is 2x
and b is equal to 8.

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.650
Whenever you have this pattern,
it simplifies to a

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:31.620
squared minus b squared.

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:33.850
And I'll show you at the end
of this video why it is.

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:35.110
But we can just do
this pattern.

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:40.910
We have a plus b times a minus
b, 2x plus 8 times 2x minus 8.

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.220
So this will simplify based on
this pattern right here to a

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:48.490
squared, which is 2x
squared, minus b

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:51.880
squared, minus 8 squared.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.230
So what does this get us?

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:58.100
This gets us 2 squared is 4
times x squared minus 8

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.490
squared, minus 64.

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:01.650
And we're done!

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.150
Now let's prove to ourselves
that this actually works.

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.630
Let's multiply a plus
b times a minus b.

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:16.430
So if we take a plus b times
a minus b, we can first

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:17.930
distribute this.

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.810
We can distribute the a plus b
onto each of these terms. So

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.820
it'll be this whole purple a
plus b times that a and then

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.210
the whole purple a plus b
times that negative b.

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:35.990
So you can view it as
a times a plus b.

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:43.610
And then you can have minus
b times a plus b.

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.030
All I did is I distributed
this onto each of those.

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.020
That times that, that's right
there, plus that times that,

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.050
that's right there.

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.160
And then we can distribute
again. a times a is a squared,

00:01:54.160 --> 00:02:00.080
a times b is ab, Negative b
times a is negative ab or

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:01.790
negative ba, same thing.

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.480
Negative b times b is
negative b squared.

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.790
And then you see you have a
positive ab and a negative ab,

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:09.830
they cancel out and
you're left with a

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.060
squared minus b squared.

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.340
So we could have actually done
this little exercise with 2x

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.090
plus 8 and 2x minus 8 and we
would have gotten this.

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:18.880
But it's neater just to see
the general pattern.

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.780
Any time you have a plus b times
a minus b, it's going to

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.980
be a squared minus b squared.

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.270
In this case, a is 2x, so a
squared is 4x squared, b is 8,

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:33.180
so b squared is 64.
