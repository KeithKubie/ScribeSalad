00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.419
we have 300 million pattern recognizers

00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:02.429
we have 300 million pattern recognizers
 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:05.900
we have 300 million pattern recognizers
in the neocortex by my estimate that

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910
in the neocortex by my estimate that
 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.570
in the neocortex by my estimate that
hierarchy we build ourselves and each of

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580
hierarchy we build ourselves and each of
 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.190
hierarchy we build ourselves and each of
these pattern recognizers capable of

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200
these pattern recognizers capable of
 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.980
these pattern recognizers capable of
connecting itself to other neocortex is

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990
connecting itself to other neocortex is
 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.959
connecting itself to other neocortex is
to build this hierarchy we build that

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969
to build this hierarchy we build that
 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.570
to build this hierarchy we build that
hierarchy from the moment were born or

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580
hierarchy from the moment were born or
 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.769
hierarchy from the moment were born or
before that we're constantly building it

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:20.779
before that we're constantly building it
 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:24.259
before that we're constantly building it
but we run up against this limitation of

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269
but we run up against this limitation of
 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.349
but we run up against this limitation of
300 million we'll be able to extend that

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359
300 million we'll be able to extend that
 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.660
300 million we'll be able to extend that
and think in the cloud you know if you

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670
and think in the cloud you know if you
 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.299
and think in the cloud you know if you
do anything interesting with this do a

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309
do anything interesting with this do a
 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.720
do anything interesting with this do a
search or a language translation or

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:34.730
search or a language translation or
 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.459
search or a language translation or
bring up a map or ask it a question it

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469
bring up a map or ask it a question it
 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.830
bring up a map or ask it a question it
doesn't take place in the box goes out

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840
doesn't take place in the box goes out
 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.280
doesn't take place in the box goes out
to the cloud we're gonna put these just

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290
to the cloud we're gonna put these just
 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.119
to the cloud we're gonna put these just
really with gateways this is a gateway

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129
really with gateways this is a gateway
 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.590
really with gateways this is a gateway
to the cloud we're gonna put gateways to

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600
to the cloud we're gonna put gateways to
 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.380
to the cloud we're gonna put gateways to
the cloud in our brains and have more

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390
the cloud in our brains and have more
 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.560
the cloud in our brains and have more
than 300 million just like the cloud can

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570
than 300 million just like the cloud can
 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.090
than 300 million just like the cloud can
give you a thousand or a million

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100
give you a thousand or a million
 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.520
give you a thousand or a million
computers for a tenth of a second you

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530
computers for a tenth of a second you
 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.340
computers for a tenth of a second you
need another billion pattern recognizers

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:03.350
need another billion pattern recognizers
 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:11.450
need another billion pattern recognizers
you'll be able access that in the cloud

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460
 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.520
