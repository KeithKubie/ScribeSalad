00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Here's the problem. I was careful about doing the here case.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
I made up this nice expression, but then I did a copy and paste,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and I edited the expression, and I swapped around the here and the there in this part.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
When I created the new state, I did that correctly.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
But down here I'm iterating over the people that were here.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I'm trying to have candidates move from there to here,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and I'm iterating over people that are here. That doesn't make any sense at all.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
I've got to fix that.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Now the question is is it going to run this time.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
I found a bug. I fixed it. Is the program correct now?

00:00:36.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Yes, no, or not enough information, you can't tell yet?
