00:00:10.528 --> 00:00:14.650
I’m Neil Hazeltine, I live and work at Hill Top Farm in Malham.

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.730
I was born and bred at Malham,
I’ve always lived on the farm.

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:22.490
The family has been here for over a hundred years.

00:00:26.224 --> 00:00:29.980
Everyday there's something to do.
There's never a day when there's not to do

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.056
so it's a very incessant work.

00:00:34.928 --> 00:00:37.370
You can’t not go out because it’s raining or snowing.

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.550
In fact on those days it’s most important that you’re out there

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.490
to make sure that the sheep have something to eat

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:46.200
and are where they should be and they’re not in any danger

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.552
from snow or wind or a combination of the two.

00:00:52.458 --> 00:00:55.420
We do try to get holidays but it’s much more difficult

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.840
cause you have to get people to look after the stock

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.520
and the people you find to qualify ought to have

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.520
a little bit of knowledge as well.

00:01:12.954 --> 00:01:14.630
In here there are belted Galloways.

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:16.740
These are the brown ones which are called Dun

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.224
and there are the black &amp; white ones

00:01:18.266 --> 00:01:22.980
and obviously they both got the characteristic
sort of belt around them, hence the name.

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:24.990
This cattle is able to live outside.

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.560
They’re able to thrive in this kind of conditions

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.922
which most cattle wouldn’t be able to do.

00:01:31.258 --> 00:01:32.610
They live outside all year round.

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.906
They live up right in front of the skyline most of the year.

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.938
There are three calves, so I come to check on those.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:47.100
But there’s one cow with a calf that is just sticking out a little bit

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.032
so I’ve come to check if that’s alright.

00:01:51.984 --> 00:01:56.064
We try to allow the cows to exhibit as much
of their natural behavior as possible.

00:01:56.112 --> 00:02:00.336
You can just see the calf laid in the thistles

00:02:00.762 --> 00:02:05.990
and I’ve seen it trying to get milk from his mother

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.008
so we’ll just go and leave her deal with it.

00:02:14.469 --> 00:02:16.940
There’s a lot of work involved with a sheep enterprise,

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.770
there’s always something to do with the sheep.

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:24.560
And the time taken up with the sheep is the time that impacts the most

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.950
upon family life because we’re working extremely hard

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.130
we spend a lot of time with the sheep

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:33.632
it can test the patience somewhat.

00:02:36.282 --> 00:02:39.610
I would never discourage my daughter from going farming

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:42.656
despite it being hard work and there are days when

00:02:42.805 --> 00:02:44.520
you maybe don’t want to do it.

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.570
There’s lot of positive in it as well and it’s a great life.

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:50.117
It is quite a nice feeling for me knowing that

00:02:50.794 --> 00:02:54.610
my forefathers
and grandfather farmed this land.

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.930
And I’m thinking that the way forward at the moment

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.000
is to go back to how things were farmed a long time ago

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.560
which seems odd in some respects.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.840
But I think we’ve got to farm in tune with nature

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.780
and we’ve got to farm in a way which

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.250
doesn’t impact negatively
upon the natural environment around us.

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.272
So there’s a nice feeling about that but

00:03:15.573 --> 00:03:19.070
that doesn’t mean I would put any pressure
on my daughter to

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:20.373
take it over.

00:03:20.373 --> 00:03:22.370
But if she wanted to, that would be great.
