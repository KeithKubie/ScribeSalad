00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.999
Daredevil was actually a pretty cool, legit
comic book, until the Affleck Attack happened.

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:11.700
But the idea of blindness enhancing other
senses is just fiction... isn't it?

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.769
Hey gang, Trace here for DNews!

00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:18.089
Thanks for tuning in.

00:00:18.089 --> 00:00:23.240
There's a common thing in superhero and fantasy
media... if one sense is lost, the others

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:24.640
get better to compensate.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.599
Do senses really DO that?

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:28.730
The research says yes!

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:33.430
The brain is a glutton for input, so if you
restrict the input channels it freaks out.

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:36.800
Sensory deprivation tanks are this in a nutshell.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.719
Research from the Journal of Nervous and Mental
Disease found, when people were placed in

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:45.859
a sensory deprivation room, the brain couldn't
tell if the thoughts and images it was creating

00:00:45.859 --> 00:00:48.210
were inside the head, or outside the body.

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.910
When deprived of input the volunteers would
experience visual hallucinations, paranoia

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:58.769
and a depressed mood -- all this, with less
than 15 MINUTES of loss of input.

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:03.829
So, if that's what happens with ALL the senses
dulled, what about with just one?

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:08.840
Studies HAVE shown blind people experience
a higher sound placement ability, and increased

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:09.840
sense of touch.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.329
This has to do with the brain literally REFORMING
to take resources from the missing sense.

00:01:14.329 --> 00:01:18.600
A study in the Journal of Neuroscience used
fMRIs to scan the brains of people who were

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.600
born deaf.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.759
They found their senses of sight and touch
were altered... and they found a boost in

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.079
the understanding bimodal stimuli.

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:29.509
Bimodal stimuli boosts are commonly seen in
those who are bilingual -- they have a lot

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:31.730
more crosstalk between their senses.

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:37.370
This means people born deaf SEE the world
differently than a fully sensed person!

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:42.100
Now, knowing ALL that -- does someone who
BECOMES blind gain sense-power?

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.799
A study that came out last week says FOR SHIZZLE.

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:49.570
Researched published in the journal Neuron
found when fully sensed mice had blindness

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.560
simulated for as little as one week -- their
hearing was boosted.

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.130
The researchers said this has to do with how
the senses work together.

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.619
Kind of like in a movie, if what you're seeing
doesn't match what you're hearing -- you'd

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.080
get messed up.

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.399
Your vision is supremely tied to what you're
hearing.

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:11.870
Their experiments found sight helps us hear
softer sounds, and have better pitch!

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.989
Because of that, your sight can help work
with your hearing to help discern talking

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:18.070
or familiar music in a loud environment.

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:22.780
If you take what you're seeing AWAY however,
your hearing has to do it alone -- and it

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.750
flips switches in your brain called thalamocortical
inputs.

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.360
This lets the auditory information borrow
some of the processing power of the visual

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.360
center.

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.200
It seems to me this is kind of like Daredevil's
power!

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.540
He's using his VISUAL center to understand
the perceived SOUND.

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:45.180
This has been documented in others too, people
who are blind yet can navigate an unfamiliar

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.690
room, and even ride a bike.

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:50.930
The switches they're talking about, are normally
not used in adults -- but in a week of blindness?

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:51.930
BAM.

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:52.930
Switched.

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:53.930
Very cool.

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.700
They also found when they removed the blindness,
the switches went back to normal -- so it's

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:58.700
reversible.

00:02:58.700 --> 00:02:59.700
Super cool.

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.680
Would you go blind for a week, for science?

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:02.930
Think of all the things you could hear!!

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.209
Come tell us down below, we read the comments
and love to chat.

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:08.950
Thanks for watching DNews, hear you later!
