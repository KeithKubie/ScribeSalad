Do you happen to have a podcast discussing loyalty to marriage that involves

2
00:00:04.541 --> 00:00:08.740
marriage to a service member?
I see many marriages,

3
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:09.633
military spouse,

4
00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:15.340
where the service member has a great background in the military but lacks

5
00:00:15.341 --> 00:00:18.820
marriage at home.
You know,

6
00:00:18.821 --> 00:00:23.821
I actually have answered this question before and maybe not this specific,

7
00:00:23.951 --> 00:00:28.840
but I'm going to go over it quickly just because this isn't just about military,

8
00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:33.940
you know,
relationships,
it's about any relationship.
But you know,

9
00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:38.830
from a military perspective,
absolutely military relationships are very hard.

10
00:00:38.831 --> 00:00:41.710
You've got time away,
you got classified work,

11
00:00:41.711 --> 00:00:44.020
there's a lack of understanding of what's going on at work.

12
00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.770
Then you've got lives his deck,
right?
And with that,

13
00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.760
the job has to come first and that's a very hard thing for people to understand

14
00:00:54.821 --> 00:00:59.050
that the job has to come first.
Why does it have to come first for survival?

15
00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.270
Because the harder you train,
the better you know your teammates,

16
00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.070
the better shot you are,

17
00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:11.290
the better your chance for actual survival in a combat situation.

18
00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:16.420
So a spouse has got to understand that,
right?

19
00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.990
That in order for the service member to take care of the family family,

20
00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.850
this service member has to do his utmost to prepare himself and his team for

21
00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.560
war.
The number one priority.

22
00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:35.730
Now,

23
00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:40.730
what the spouse has to understand is that this doesn't mean that he wants to

24
00:01:42.901 --> 00:01:45.090
spend time away from his family.

25
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:50.300
He doesn't want to prioritize his team over his family.

26
00:01:51.121 --> 00:01:55.080
He doesn't want to miss the recital,
doesn't want to miss the ball game,

27
00:01:55.081 --> 00:01:59.250
doesn't want to miss the teacher's conference,
but he has to.

28
00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.840
He has to.
So spouse,

29
00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:08.670
don't be mad when he makes that priority

30
00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.430
except an understand that the family is the number one priority.

31
00:02:14.431 --> 00:02:17.220
It is the number one priority,

32
00:02:17.221 --> 00:02:19.740
but in order to be there for the family,

33
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000
he's got to prepare for war so that he can come home to his family after

34
00:02:28.121 --> 00:02:30.850
deployment.
Now this,

35
00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.880
this obviously also applies to police.

36
00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.410
This applies to firefighters,
and I'll tell you what,

37
00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.110
it applies really to the breadwinner,

38
00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.680
man or wife,
husband or wife in any walk of life,
right?

39
00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.530
If you're the breadwinner for the family,
you've,
that's what you're doing.

40
00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:57.720
The way that you're taking care of the family is by bringing home money so that

41
00:02:58.091 --> 00:03:03.091
there is food and housing and clothing and a secure future.

42
00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.720
That's what you're doing.
And so the,

43
00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:12.590
the spouse in these situations has to understand that the hard work,

44
00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:17.540
the hard work and the hours and the days in the weeks that are taken away from

45
00:03:17.541 --> 00:03:18.374
the family

46
00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.360
is actually done to provide for the family.
Right?

47
00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.490
So that's the key piece that people have to understand that the,

48
00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:31.700
that the spouse has to understand.

49
00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.810
Now the service member,
and again,
I've,
I've talked about this before,

50
00:03:37.811 --> 00:03:42.010
the service member or the firefighter or the police officer or the breadwinner,

51
00:03:42.011 --> 00:03:45.790
what they have to do is they have to make sure that they don't go overboard,

52
00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:50.570
that they draw the line somewhere,

53
00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:54.380
that they don't destroy what it is that you're trying to protect.

54
00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.480
Don't destroy what it is you're trying to take care of.

55
00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:59.930
Don't give the plants so much water that you drown it.

56
00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.740
Don't cook the steak so long that you burn it.

57
00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:11.190
Don't work so hard for your family that you don't have a family anymore.

58
00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.570
You got to have the balance

59
00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.660
in.

60
00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.360
One of the things that you've got to do is you got to explain that to the family

61
00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:25.440
and you've got to tell them what's up and you've got to tell them that they are

62
00:04:25.441 --> 00:04:29.640
the more most important thing and that all this work that you're doing that's

63
00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:32.430
taking you away from them is actually being done for them.

64
00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:36.880
And you've got to communicate that to them.
They've got to understand it.

65
00:04:36.881 --> 00:04:40.640
It's hard for them to listen to their heart.
For a a,
an eight year old kid,

66
00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.710
don't understand why you're missing the,
the,

67
00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:47.110
the baseball game or what the six year old girl,
while you're missing the digits,

68
00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.810
who tournament or whatever.
It's hard to explain that,

69
00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.060
but you've got to at least try.

70
00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:55.780
You gotta make it evident them and you also have to make sure you don't abuse
it,

71
00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:57.131
right?

72
00:04:57.131 --> 00:05:02.131
Because work work can be fun and hanging out with our teammates for an extra day

73
00:05:06.401 --> 00:05:11.401
of shooting or an extra day of jumping or having a beer at the pub on the way

74
00:05:11.651 --> 00:05:14.950
home.
That can also sometimes be more appealing than the recital,

75
00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:20.140
then the ballgame.
So don't abuse it.

76
00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:26.400
Do you have to take care of your family and you have to talk to each other and

77
00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:31.240
understand this balance together,

78
00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:37.680
understand the sacrifices that are being made on both sides so that you can work

79
00:05:38.831 --> 00:05:43.831
it out and maintain the strength of that entity,

80
00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:45.970
the family that you're trying to take care of.
