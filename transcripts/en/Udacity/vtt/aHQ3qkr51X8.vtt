00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.010
So we're going to generalize this
notion of a Bellman equation to

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:04.100
Bellman Equations.

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.190
And the way we're going to do that is by
noting that in the previous derivation.

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:11.370
The way that we're thinking about
things is we capture this V here,

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.805
as the repeating structure that's
starts with the max a, right?

00:00:15.805 --> 00:00:17.455
So it's actually this piece.

00:00:17.455 --> 00:00:19.025
This sort of infinite piece here.

00:00:19.025 --> 00:00:22.215
So the whole V consists
of this sub V in it and

00:00:22.215 --> 00:00:25.135
this is why this piece gets
substituted for the V in the equation.

00:00:25.135 --> 00:00:25.985
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and that makes sense.

00:00:25.985 --> 00:00:30.115
And you have an infinite number of
these things going on forever and ever.

00:00:30.115 --> 00:00:33.325
And I noticed an infinite
number of left parentheses and

00:00:33.325 --> 00:00:34.500
not enough right parentheses.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.880
Oh, no.
This stripe bracket

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.860
has traditionally represented
the balancing of all left parentheses.

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:39.510
&gt;&gt; Oh, right.

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:40.540
That's from LISP.

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:41.650
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's just a shorthand.

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:42.970
&gt;&gt; Nice.
Nice lisp.

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:43.710
LISP.
See?

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:44.282
Lisp.
&gt;&gt; Lisp.

00:00:44.282 --> 00:00:48.830
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Nice LISP reference.

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:49.470
&gt;&gt; Thanks!

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:53.320
But the thing is because this is
an infinite sequence, there's actually

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.590
a number of other ways that we
can group this infinite sequence.

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:56.560
So let me draw another one.

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:57.910
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; So we can also group

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:59.400
the infinite sequence here.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.610
And notice that it repeats like this.

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.959
So, this expression after the max,
the starting from the R and

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:07.620
then moving forward repeats again here.

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.840
And so we can actually make
a new equation that depends on

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.430
that substructure repeated.

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:13.440
So let me right that out.

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.600
So, the idea is, we can actually just
give a name to this big outer brace.

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.710
So we'll call it, Q (s,a) and
we'll say it's equal to R (s,a) plus

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.424
the discount factor times the sum
over the next possible state, so

00:01:24.424 --> 00:01:26.239
the probably of getting there.

00:01:26.239 --> 00:01:31.023
Times max a2, our next max, of and then
there's that repeating structure again

00:01:31.023 --> 00:01:34.260
so we can just plug in Q of
S prime a prime for that.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:38.340
This gives us another Bellman equation
that instead of starting at the S point.

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.370
Kind of starts after
the action has started.

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:44.560
&gt;&gt; Well, wait if it starts after the
action has started why isn't it Q of a?

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:45.970
&gt;&gt; Okay that's a fair question.

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.070
So could we have written
the Q value of an action,

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.530
the Q value of this point
in the sequence, this way?

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.870
Right, the reward for leaving that
state and taking that action,

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:58.090
plus the discounted value of the future.

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:59.350
What's the problem with this?

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.250
&gt;&gt; Well, I see two problems.

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.400
One is kind of mathematical and
one is sort of semantic.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.290
So, mathematically,
it doesn't make sense,

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.080
because where did the S come from,
in R(S,a)?

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.210
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
this is an unbound variable, right?

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.930
So that's an error.

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:11.930
&gt;&gt; We can't have that.

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:13.320
And the second is,

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:17.800
when you actually write it that way, so
here you're arguing that Q is like V?

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:18.420
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.960
&gt;&gt; Right?

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.614
So you're asking me what the qual view.

00:02:21.614 --> 00:02:25.340
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Of a is.

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.350
But the value of
an action is meaningless,

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.670
except in the presence of the state
where you're taking an action.

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:32.430
&gt;&gt; That's exactly right.

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:33.450
So, in particular,

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.090
we're conditioning our reward on
both the state and the action.

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.640
So it doesn't really make
sense to be able to talk about

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.290
what our future value's going to be if
we don't really know where we started.

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.270
So the idea here is that we started
at some state S, we take action a and

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.720
then we proceed every after.

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:48.970
&gt;&gt; Okay, so that makes sense.
