&gt;&gt;Kara: Ok. Hi everybody. Thanks for coming
at the end of the day here, I know its tiring

00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:02.429
and you wanna get to drinkin', as do I, but
 --

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:03.429
[audience laughs}

00:00:03.429 --> 00:00:04.549
but we will, this is gonna be sort of a conversation
so try to close your little laptops and various

00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:06.999
devices. And, and we're gonna try and have
a good conversation about where Social is

00:00:06.999 --> 00:00:09.390
going. And talk about, we have some great
panelists here, it's a large panel.

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:18.990
I think I was brought in because I did one
recently at Twitter's, what was that called?

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:26.920
SHERP or whatever. How funny. So they so they
I was brought in to sort of, of abuse a panel

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:35.100
of dudes and here I am again which is my favorite
thing. So, again, once again, a panel--

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.260
&gt;&gt;Adam: Of dudes.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:42.130
&gt;&gt;Kara: Dudes, so it's essentially Sausage
Fest Part 2. So,

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:43.149
[panel laughs]

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:47.330
I think I can handle them, though. So, we're
gonna introduce, everyone's gonna introduce

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.140
themselves and we have about an hour and I'm
gonna spend the last 15 minutes of questions,

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:55.850
it would be really great because I certainly
don't always ask the best questions. I ask

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.110
some good questions, but I think you guys
probably have better questions than I ever

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:02.400
could. So, just think of some questions you
want to ask, and we're talking about a wide

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.420
range of things from privacy to mobile to
where it's all going to mistakes that you

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.620
all might have made. I know it's not possible
for Google to make mistakes because their

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.900
brains are so big, but I think we're gonna
talk about where that's going. Don't laugh.

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.380
Ok, anyway, let's introduce ourselves. Starting
with Kara and going.

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:24.420
&gt;&gt;Chris: So, my name is Chris Messina. I am
the Google employee on the panel. I actually

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.200
work in Developer Relations on the Social
Web team and I recently joined Google, actually

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.470
in January. So, before that I worked for myself
as an Independent Consultant and more recently

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:38.030
I've started working on the Buzz APIs. So,
doing a lot of work to move forward in our

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.312
operability in the Social Web and open things
up in general.

00:01:40.312 --> 00:01:42.150
&gt;&gt;Neil: Neil Sample, I'm Vice President of
the Social, Open, and Publishing Platforms

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:51.070
at Yahoo. I've been at Yahoo for about six
years and in the valley forever. So I guess

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:58.610
I've probably seen all of it, built a third
of it, and clearly like the Google guys, have

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.939
never made any mistakes or stepped in it.

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:04.520
&gt;&gt;Kara: Heh, that's not true. Anyway, go ahead,
thanks.

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:11.049
&gt;&gt;Chris: I'm Chris Cole. I'm a lead architect
with MySpace Developer Platform with OpenSocial

00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:16.599
and I've been there a couple years and taken
some licks and I predate the dot-com stuff

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:22.439
so I've seen the that the wave a couple times.
And other than that, I'm looking forward to

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:23.439
the panel.

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:24.439
&gt;&gt;Kara: Great.

00:02:24.439 --> 00:02:29.010
&gt;&gt;Adam: Hi, I'm Adam Nash. I'm the Vice President
for Search &amp; Platform Products at LinkedIn,

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:35.449
so I'm responsible for our search engine and
search capabilities as well as our APIs both

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:38.069
on-site and, and off-site and our mobile products.

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:44.650
&gt;&gt;Angus: Hi, I'm Angus from Microsoft and
I work on Windows Live, specifically the partnerships

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:49.959
that we do around social technologies like
Windows Live Messenger, Hotmail, and SkyDrive.

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:57.459
&gt;&gt;Ryan: Hey, I'm Ryan Sarver and I'm the Director
of the Twitter platform. For us, it's obviously

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:01.560
the third-party developers, APIs, content
syndication, and I joined about a year ago

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.349
so it's been an interesting ride.

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:07.609
&gt;&gt;Kara: Great. Ok, I'm gonna refer to you
by like: Twitter dude, Microsoft dude, LinkedIn

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:12.439
dude, if you don't mind. Not to be rude or
anything, but that's how I'm gonna remember

00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:17.389
best. So, let's talk first, I know, just so
you know one group that's not here is Facebook,

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:21.439
which is obviously, if you've heard of them,
they're a big social network that people seem

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:23.459
to like. So, they aren't gonna be able to
talk about themselves so, let's, you know,

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:24.459
bash them. But one of issues obviously this
week around Facebook is, they should, we should

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:25.459
have a Facebook person here. That said, issues
around privacy have become a big deal this

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:28.030
week. A lot of it focused on Facebook, but
each individually, each of your companies,

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.970
Google with Buzz, various, Microsoft has issues,
Twitter's issues with, with privacy and what

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:36.479
happens in this thing. Let's start there because
that's the hot button issue at this moment.

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:47.340
So, Chris, talk-- talk a little bit about
how you look at this debate. Is it overblown?

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:54.199
Is it something that's just too much? Do consumers
care?

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:55.579
&gt;&gt;Chris: Sure.

00:03:55.579 --> 00:03:59.269
&gt;&gt;Kara: That kind of stuff.

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:07.700
&gt;&gt;Chris Cole: So, this is one of the, the
things I've been talking to a lot of people

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:12.560
about lately. And I think this is an industry
wide issue which is why each one of us has

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:18.250
had different experiences I'd say with, with
privacy in general. And I think that on the

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:22.759
one hand there are expectations that are changing.
The desire for people to be able to publish

00:04:22.759 --> 00:04:26.139
things and have their friends be able to find
them in a way that's meaningful to them, is

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:30.789
very important. On the flip side of that when
people are surprised by information being

00:04:30.789 --> 00:04:35.139
shared that they hadn't necessarily anticipated
being found by certain people, then that creates

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:39.550
a tension and erodes trust. So one of the
hardest things that we're having to deal with

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:44.740
now in general and I, I say we as in the industry
is coming up with interaction models that

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:50.039
I think address people's expectations. And
at the same time don't overwhelm them with

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:54.340
too many choices. Because on the one hand
you can frontload all this stuff, like I'm

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:58.970
sure everybody reads every terms of service
before you install software and so if you're

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:02.669
willing to that and you're one of those people
then you probably love eight thousand--

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:05.479
&gt;&gt;Kara: You probably don't have any friends,
then.

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:10.440
&gt;&gt;Chris: That's possible too but if we frontload
the user experience around the privacy stuff,

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:14.990
then people won't use the stuff. If it's not
made so that people have a clear understanding

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:19.169
of where the stuff is gonna go and who's gonna
see it, then they get upset later on. And

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:21.910
I think there's a there's an interesting balance.
One of the things that we're betting on or

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:26.159
at least that I think is necessary in the
industry is for more interoperability. People

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:30.939
can experiment, try new things have different
services that start up with say as being public

00:05:30.939 --> 00:05:50.009
like Twitter By Default and let that flourish
and see how that goes and then try other services

00:05:50.009 --> 00:05:54.000
that start private By Default like email.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:01.569
&gt;&gt;Kara: Right. Now, Yahoo has hasn't done
as much they do a lot they've been bringing

00:06:01.569 --> 00:06:10.409
Facebook in and some other services into the
service, but in terms of you've tried Yahoo

00:06:10.409 --> 00:06:19.830
360, but it wasn't --it was a valiant effort--
but it didn't work in any way whatsoever.

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:21.680
But what--

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:23.960
&gt;&gt;Neil: It's huge in Vietnam, actually.

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:24.960
[laughter]

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:25.960
&gt;&gt;Kara: Oh, great.

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:26.960
&gt;&gt;Neil: But write that down.

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:27.960
[laughter]

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:28.960
&gt;&gt;Kara: It's like Orkut. I had Orkut saying,
"You know, we're big in Brazil." I'm like,

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:29.960
"Nice work."

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:30.960
[laughter]

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:31.960
Anyway, that said, how do you how do you look
at because Yahoo's been very protective of

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:32.960
people. It, it hasn't been gotten stuck in
these privacy problems. What do you think

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:33.960
the big issues are when you look at the other
companies or--

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:34.960
&gt;&gt;Neil: Yeah, I think it's, it's we don't
wanna be throwing stones you know those folks

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:35.960
who live in glass houses. I mean, we've still
got a lot of investment in privacy a large

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:36.960
investment in trust and of course as soon
as I say something some security hole is gonna

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:37.960
open up. I think Yahoo has been more conservative
than, than some of our partners. And that's

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:39.810
one of the reasons why we still have a high
level of, of trust. And I, I have to act on

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:43.300
Chris's point, you have to make it simple,
you have to make it obvious, you can't really

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:48.850
frontload the experience. If you go through
all the nuance of the toss, again, it's not

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:50.349
that there's anybody like that they don't
have friends --they just don't have software--

00:06:50.349 --> 00:06:53.689
the crap's too scary to start engaging. So,
you have to make it simple and you have to

00:06:53.689 --> 00:06:59.409
make it clean. But the, the interesting thing
I think we've seen the thing that's perhaps

00:06:59.409 --> 00:07:05.050
unexpected is that there's, there's almost
no limit to the level of recourse that that

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:10.069
folks seem to be giving right now for Facebook.
That there's enough value in it that, "Ok,

00:07:10.069 --> 00:07:14.430
we're gonna, we're gonna screw up and we're
gonna tell everybody what your Christmas presents

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:20.541
are. And then a couple years later we're gonna
accidentally out you through an API and a

00:07:20.541 --> 00:07:23.669
couple years later after that we're gonna
move everybody sort of surreptitiously to

00:07:23.669 --> 00:07:33.120
public broadcasting of status." And then people
will notice and they'll spin up a group--

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:34.182
&gt;&gt;Kara: And then someday we'll be imprisoning
people with red hair just because we don't

00:07:34.182 --> 00:07:35.182
like, I mean it--

00:07:35.182 --> 00:07:36.182
&gt;&gt;Neil: The gingers are everywhere. Right!

00:07:36.182 --> 00:07:37.182
[laughter]

00:07:37.182 --> 00:07:39.550
And I don't know when people are gonna rise
up and say, "No!" That's the thing that's

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:40.930
been really surprising--

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:44.599
&gt;&gt;Kara: That's Google I/O 20/20 just so you--

00:07:44.599 --> 00:07:49.120
&gt;&gt;Neil: Yeah, exactly. The end of the gingers.
But, folks have been burned several times

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:53.999
and yet they're still coming back. I have
to believe that there's gotta be a line somewhere.

00:07:53.999 --> 00:07:59.219
But we still don't know quite where it is.
That, again we've, we've seen fast and loose

00:07:59.219 --> 00:08:03.240
play with people's privacy in industry and,
and nobody's really paying the price yet.

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:04.240
&gt;&gt;Kara: So, MySpace was one of the original
companies that really was sharing. I mean,

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:06.780
pioneered the idea of excessive sharing, some
might say. This has moved to a level well

00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:18.310
beyond that. At the time that MySpace started,
it was it was somewhat controversial, somewhat

00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:19.979
embarrassing for some people.

00:08:19.979 --> 00:08:26.069
&gt;&gt;Chris Cole: Yeah, well MySpace came on at
the tail end of the dot-com bubble. And if

00:08:26.069 --> 00:08:30.430
you remember back then everyone was absolutely
beside themselves with fear with this whole

00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:35.530
notion of a "cookie". And that you might be
attachable to what you're doing online. And

00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:40.599
this debate went on for many years. And then
all of a sudden people are enjoying sharing

00:08:40.599 --> 00:08:46.660
things with their friends. But-- but what
bothers me about trend recede is it's gone

00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:53.360
so far as there's a difference between posting
something online and having it publicly available

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:57.880
where maybe your friends will copy it and
they might send it to someone you don't know

00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:02.800
or don't want it to have it. There's, there's
a stark contrast between that and having something

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:14.501
broadcasted to everyone in the world without
you're necessarily being aware that this is

00:09:14.501 --> 00:09:15.501
happening.

00:09:15.501 --> 00:09:17.750
&gt;&gt;Kara: Just what Facebook just did.

00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:18.870
&gt;&gt;Chris Cole: Yeah.

00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:32.649
&gt;&gt;Kara: All of a sudden my children's' pictures
were up on the Web not with my friends kind

00:09:32.649 --> 00:09:33.649
of thing.

00:09:33.649 --> 00:09:34.649
&gt;&gt;Chris Cole: Yeah, and this is the--

00:09:34.649 --> 00:09:35.649
&gt;&gt;Kara: What goes into the mentality of that
because you guys have to, you just put new

00:09:35.649 --> 00:09:36.649
privacy policies out?

00:09:36.649 --> 00:09:37.649
&gt;&gt;Chris Cole: Yeah, and some of that is more
highlighted in what we've already been doing.

00:09:37.649 --> 00:09:38.649
We're constantly tweaking this, but we have
a really deep background in respecting people's

00:09:38.649 --> 00:09:39.649
privacy and there's been a number of things
over the years where--

00:09:39.649 --> 00:09:40.649
&gt;&gt;Kara: Well, the pedophile, the pedophile
incidence.

00:09:40.649 --> 00:09:41.649
&gt;&gt;Chris Cole: Yeah, we've had, we've had a
very sordid history of, of that certainly.

00:09:41.649 --> 00:09:42.649
&gt;&gt;Kara: That--

00:09:42.649 --> 00:09:43.649
&gt;&gt;Chris Cole: and among other things.

00:09:43.649 --> 00:09:44.649
&gt;&gt;Kara: Oh, those pedophiles.

00:09:44.649 --> 00:09:45.649
&gt;&gt;Chris Cole: And we've cleaned up a lot of
that over time, so we've been burned our,

00:09:45.649 --> 00:09:49.780
in our own right. My fear is that this is
gonna be ignored by the industry to the point

00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:54.510
that it'll have to be settled through lawsuits
and tort law and it's the precipice that we're

00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:55.510
walking up to right now.

00:09:55.510 --> 00:09:58.800
&gt;&gt;Kara: Well, it's a perfect thing for an
Attorney General to make a lot of noise over

00:09:58.800 --> 00:09:59.800
for sure.

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:01.080
&gt;&gt;Chris Cole: Yeah, and you're seeing that
in Washington right now.

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:03.300
&gt;&gt;Kara: Oh, I think the FCC is gonna move
very soon if they feel brave. Let's go to

00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:10.820
Twitter first. Now, you guys are all about
public broadcasting, so it's as much of a,

00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:15.779
I think you've had a Geolocation things like
that where people somewhat are willing to

00:10:15.779 --> 00:10:21.350
do that. You guys started out sharing. I mean,
Facebook you started off thinking it was just

00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:25.570
your friends and then they suddenly broadcast
all your information outward. Google Buzz,

00:10:25.570 --> 00:10:30.430
even Walt Mossberg called me and said he's
my partner, called me and said, "I can't stop

00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:32.529
it." You know what I mean? And if someone
who's like the worlds expert on technology

00:10:32.529 --> 00:10:33.750
can't stop something from propagating there's
an issue. But, you guys started out that way.

00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:38.870
So, how do you, I mean people know they're
sharing with one million of their best friends

00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:40.010
kind of thing.

00:10:40.010 --> 00:10:43.709
&gt;&gt;Ryan: Yeah, I think part of it's about the
premise that it's founded on. We were somewhat

00:10:43.709 --> 00:10:47.810
fortunate through product decisions and, and
just luck in terms of stumbling on a certain

00:10:47.810 --> 00:10:51.890
model that that resonate, but people came
to the service having that expectation from

00:10:51.890 --> 00:10:56.529
day one. And you opt into that and that expectation
is shared throughout the network. When you

00:10:56.529 --> 00:11:00.450
start on a premise of private and small networks
and have to then shift the user base to an

00:11:00.450 --> 00:11:02.910
area where you want them to share. I think
that's where a lot of the consternations starts

00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:10.400
to happen because most users aren't in tune
enough in the same way we are in the valley

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:13.850
around like, what all that actually means,
what the implications five to ten years down

00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:15.570
the road are. So it's very hard to let them
understand the nuances over time. So, we've

00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:19.400
been fortunate that we started out with that
initial premise and that seems to be the one

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:22.940
that people are trending towards and we're
able to stay where we are and that just--

00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:24.620
&gt;&gt;Kara: You're adding more specific things,
Geolocation, that kind of things, which is

00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:30.079
a little more intrusive I would say.

00:11:30.079 --> 00:11:34.430
&gt;&gt;Ryan: Intrusive but it's still opt in, right?
And we give people the granularity to choose

00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:44.920
what they wanna share. And we, we talked a
long time when we were originally doing Geolocation

00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:57.389
cause we wanted it to be like private and
you choose who it goes to and it, it breaks

00:11:57.389 --> 00:12:19.290
the model. Like, we want what you share to
be the exact same object that everyone else

00:12:19.290 --> 00:12:20.290
sees. So, we try and do it in the same way.
We try and maintain that same product vision

00:12:20.290 --> 00:12:21.290
that what you see about your own content and
what your friend sees about your own content.

00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:22.290
If it gets syndicated out to Google to someone
you don't know, they will see that exact same

00:12:22.290 --> 00:12:23.290
object. And its, so it's about the expectation
of what you're sharing, but I think changes

00:12:23.290 --> 00:12:24.290
how people share and people expect--

00:12:24.290 --> 00:12:25.290
&gt;&gt;Kara: You think most of the things should
be opt-in? Because this is, opt-in is like

00:12:25.290 --> 00:12:26.290
a dirty word for most of these companies.

00:12:26.290 --> 00:12:27.290
&gt;&gt;Ryan: [sighs] I think Chris hit on it a
bit, it it's a tough balance between like,

00:12:27.290 --> 00:12:28.290
transparency and knobs to turn and all that
kind of stuff. Because users, at some point,

00:12:28.290 --> 00:12:29.290
there's a threshold that they just stop looking
at them. So you can give them all the knobs

00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:30.290
in the world and I think that's what you're
seeing on Facebook. There's a lot of good

00:12:30.290 --> 00:12:31.290
intentions to give people all the control
they want but users, like they look at a--

00:12:31.290 --> 00:12:32.290
tossed and glean right over it.

00:12:32.290 --> 00:12:33.290
&gt;&gt;Kara: Well, why can't it just be like a
thing that just popped up, "We're about to

00:12:33.290 --> 00:12:34.290
put all your pictures out for all your stalkers
to see. Yes or no?"

00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:35.290
[Ryan laughs]

00:12:35.290 --> 00:12:36.839
I, I'm sure I can write something rather clear
about what's gonna happen.

00:12:36.839 --> 00:12:39.959
&gt;&gt;Ryan: Well, I think that's why you see the,
the content shared on Twitter is very different

00:12:39.959 --> 00:12:43.089
from the content shared on Facebook, right?
You don't see a lot of photo albums of like,

00:12:43.089 --> 00:12:47.130
families and stuff. You see a single shot
of like some event or something you're expressing

00:12:47.130 --> 00:12:51.930
or experiencing as opposed to these more personalized
content.

00:12:51.930 --> 00:12:54.240
&gt;&gt;Kara: I wonder why it can't be easier. I
mean, why, why--

00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:58.550
&gt;&gt;Ryan: I mean it's the simple nuances of
human nature. I mean, there's, you're trying

00:12:58.550 --> 00:13:02.029
to take it and make it this digital thing
that has knobs and selections. And there's

00:13:02.029 --> 00:13:05.800
different types of relationships and data
flows much more easily, which I think is also

00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:11.649
harder when you're dealing with human relationships
it's a little easier to keep it contained.

00:13:11.649 --> 00:13:13.440
But where it's digital and it can flow throughout
the network and be syndicated out to millions

00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:18.600
of people across the world instantly. It changes
the nature of how you have to think about

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:19.600
it.

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:20.600
&gt;&gt;Kara: But explaining it to people is that
hard? I mean, I think they're, they're aggressively,

00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:21.600
purposefully being confusing in a lot of ways.

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:27.810
&gt;&gt;Chris: So, actually, I would, I would respond
to that. Because it's been interesting to

00:13:27.810 --> 00:13:32.100
watch how Facebook has tried to explain some
of these things. Specifically, my girlfriend

00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:37.019
was using Facebook. And there was some time
many months ago they put up this "terms of

00:13:37.019 --> 00:13:40.480
service change" thing where they were inviting
people to go participate. To read whatever

00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:44.620
it was they were gonna change. And it was
there for two or three days at the top of

00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:48.779
the News Feed, I think this was before the
redesign. And I asked her several days after

00:13:48.779 --> 00:13:53.110
when she was like surprised that the terms
had changed. Like, "Didn't you see that thing

00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:54.360
sitting at the top of your News Feed, like
blocking your view?" And she's like, "Oh.

00:13:54.360 --> 00:14:00.690
I saw that but I just, I didn't engage with
it." So, we've had a similar experience with

00:14:00.690 --> 00:14:04.290
Buzz. Where we've also provided certain types
of disclosure about: " Look, you know, you

00:14:04.290 --> 00:14:10.050
can enable this if you really want to" but
I think people are oftentimes, they have an

00:14:10.050 --> 00:14:14.360
objective in mind when they arrive at something
and they're gonna blow through whatever else

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:15.360
gets in their way.

00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:16.829
&gt;&gt;Kara: Perhaps, I mean, unless you give them
a chance. One of the things we did on our,

00:14:16.829 --> 00:14:19.819
we, Walt was very particular about making
people aware of cookies and --

00:14:19.819 --> 00:14:20.819
&gt;&gt;Chris: Sure.

00:14:20.819 --> 00:14:24.550
&gt;&gt;Kara: our headline was "We're watching everything
you do right now. Do you want to do something

00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:29.610
about it?" We were very; we were very, getting
their attention. We're sneakily following

00:14:29.610 --> 00:14:30.870
you everywhere on the Web. They're always
to alert people.

00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:33.199
&gt;&gt;Chris: And I guess if you use it like that,
like, like there's someone looking over your

00:14:33.199 --> 00:14:36.730
shoulder right now, don't turn around kind
of thing. I mean, maybe that would work, but

00:14:36.730 --> 00:14:40.430
I think when we try to do all these things
across all these different sites in a way

00:14:40.430 --> 00:14:41.720
that isn't too alarmist--

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:42.720
&gt;&gt;Kara: Right.

00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:45.579
&gt;&gt;Chris: but still informs, I mean, you're
right, unless we're screaming at them.

00:14:45.579 --> 00:14:47.120
&gt;&gt;Kara: Why not be alarmist?

00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:48.120
&gt;&gt;Chris: I think that--

00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:53.011
&gt;&gt;Kara: The weird guy from high school can
find you now. Something like that.

00:14:53.011 --> 00:14:58.130
&gt;&gt;Chris: I do want to AB test that. You guys
wanna try that?

00:14:58.130 --> 00:14:59.509
[panel laughter]

00:14:59.509 --> 00:15:11.709
&gt;&gt;Kara: So, Microsoft, one of you guys, how
do you look at the, cause you have a business

00:15:11.709 --> 00:15:17.490
part that is quite privacy oriented and then
you have struggled in a consumer space more.

00:15:17.490 --> 00:15:32.060
But how do you look at this idea where people
are doing this aggressive sharing?

00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:46.649
&gt;&gt;Angus: I think the key thing is that privacy
is in our DNA. I mean, like you said that

00:15:46.649 --> 00:15:53.300
there's the business side where we are quite
private. There's one privacy, like, central

00:15:53.300 --> 00:16:00.100
organization inside Microsoft or our Trustworthy
Computing. That's a part of every engineering

00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:06.769
process, whether you're working on like, shippable
software, like box product, or whether you're

00:16:06.769 --> 00:16:11.339
working on online services. So, I mean, when
it comes to Windows Live, specifically, I

00:16:11.339 --> 00:16:28.360
think a lot of what Chris said is, is important.
Like, do not surprise people. And the scary

00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:36.730
thing about that is if someone's surprised
then you've already done something wrong.

00:16:36.730 --> 00:16:45.990
Like, people need to be able to choose who
can see what of theirs and they need to be

00:16:45.990 --> 00:17:00.689
able to get granular or that we need to make
sure that the defaults are set to an appropriate

00:17:00.689 --> 00:17:20.590
level. So, it's just about expectation management.
And I mean, with, I think it's about 500 million

00:17:20.590 --> 00:17:28.590
people currently have Windows Live ID's, that's
a huge number of people that are, that we

00:17:28.590 --> 00:17:32.080
want to make sure we get privacy right for.

00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:37.910
&gt;&gt;Kara: Mm-hmm. Do you think it's because
Microsoft's, I mean, of all, I mean, based

00:17:37.910 --> 00:17:43.030
on the promiscuous scale, Facebooks way down
here, Microsoft hasn't been as successful

00:17:43.030 --> 00:17:48.360
because their lack of promiscuity. I'm trying
to-- you know what I mean?

00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:52.520
&gt;&gt;Angus: I mean, I'm not even gonna go there,
actually.

00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:54.600
&gt;&gt;Kara: You're not as easy!

00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:55.600
[panel laughter]

00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:56.600
&gt;&gt;Angus: Yeah.

00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:57.600
[pause]

00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:00.390
&gt;&gt;Kara: But, why, why, you need to have to
do that?

00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:01.390
[laughter]

00:18:01.390 --> 00:18:06.670
Do you need to have to get there to be successful;
to be that, you know, give--

00:18:06.670 --> 00:18:17.060
&gt;&gt;Angus: I don't think so. I think you can
build a perfectly good business that satis--,

00:18:17.060 --> 00:18:20.820
that satisfies tons of consumers and advertisers
by keeping everything legit.

00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:25.990
&gt;&gt;Kara: Right. I'll move to a vacuum cleaner
metaphor. They have a giant sucking vacuum

00:18:25.990 --> 00:18:34.620
cleaner; yours is less, set on a less level.
I mean, can you be successful when it's not

00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:45.260
like that? When it's not sucking every piece
of information ever about you in-, indiscriminately?

00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:52.100
&gt;&gt;Angus: I think you can absolutely be successful.
Yeah, definitely.

00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:53.100
[laughter]

00:18:53.100 --> 00:19:02.960
&gt;&gt;Kara: LinkedIn guy, dude, so you guys I
have to say I think do have the most, the

00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:11.880
easiest used tools. To-- and the people on
LinkedIn do want to share. They want to share

00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:17.770
information about themselves a lot for jobs,
a lot for job search, and stuff like that.

00:19:17.770 --> 00:19:25.740
So the intent is very clear. I find the tools
simple to use; it's very clear about how,

00:19:25.740 --> 00:19:32.200
what you're putting up, who's getting what
and it's actually quite protective about a

00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:33.200
lot of things.

00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:48.110
&gt;&gt;Adam: Well, I think that's, that's actually
part of makes these problems so hard is that--

00:19:48.110 --> 00:19:49.570
&gt;&gt;audience1: Microphone.

00:19:49.570 --> 00:19:55.940
&gt;&gt;Adam: Sorry? I think that's part of makes
it such a hard problem across the, the social

00:19:55.940 --> 00:20:03.430
Web is that context really matters. This isn't
just a technical problem, it isn't just a

00:20:03.430 --> 00:20:15.010
cognitive problem understanding what we could
or couldn't do. The fact is no one ever writes

00:20:15.010 --> 00:20:30.010
down social contracts, right? Communities
form, then they evolve. We've been very fortunate,

00:20:30.010 --> 00:20:40.470
you know. LinkedIn's always taken privacy
very seriously because in business context

00:20:40.470 --> 00:20:45.510
there is some information that you really
do guard, right? If you're unhappy with your

00:20:45.510 --> 00:20:52.930
employer and you're looking around for a new
job, that's something very private. We take

00:20:52.930 --> 00:21:02.690
it very seriously that we always want people
on LinkedIn to feel like they put their best

00:21:02.690 --> 00:21:11.340
foot forward. We would never want to embarrass
someone. On the flip side, LinkedIn users

00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:18.740
have always been, ever since we launched the
feature, delighted to find out that the first

00:21:18.740 --> 00:21:23.580
time that someone Googles them, that their
LinkedIn profile comes up high because that

00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:27.800
professional side of you, that professional
persona that we all spend decades kind of

00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:34.010
working on through our careers; that's actually
the default one that a lot people are comfortable

00:21:34.010 --> 00:21:35.600
with a stranger seeing.

00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:36.600
&gt;&gt;Kara: Mm-hmm.

00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:42.820
&gt;&gt;Adam: And so, I think yeah, LinkedIn has
done well in this area, but I think that's

00:21:42.820 --> 00:21:47.160
partially because we're very focused on our
context and what users want from that context.

00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:56.140
&gt;&gt;Kara: But you don't have a whole lot of
information on your thing. I mean, I love

00:21:56.140 --> 00:22:02.080
LinkedIn because if I, I'm able to reach all
the Yahoo executives I want to leak to me,

00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:03.080
for example, but--

00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:04.080
[laughter]

00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:07.790
and Facebook works really well, too. Sorry.
Not you. So, not yet.

00:22:07.790 --> 00:22:08.790
[laughter]

00:22:08.790 --> 00:22:17.190
Do you need to add more stuff to that because
you imagine having, you don't have any pictures,

00:22:17.190 --> 00:22:23.390
it's somewhat, not, that's not the right word.
It's somewhat plain vanilla kind of stuff.

00:22:23.390 --> 00:22:25.400
&gt;&gt;Adam: Well, yeah, it's focused--

00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:38.030
&gt;&gt;Kara: It's like a resume. It's looking at
someone's resume with a little bit more.

00:22:38.030 --> 00:22:55.650
&gt;&gt;Adam: Yeah, but, it's only a mix of information
that people share etc., but for the most part,

00:22:55.650 --> 00:23:08.610
yeah, your professional profile first and
foremost is that first value proposition that

00:23:08.610 --> 00:23:15.470
people get. That, "Hey, when someone looks
for me online, they're gonna see me this way.

00:23:15.470 --> 00:23:24.460
This is my role at LinkedIn and previously
I worked at these companies. I went to this

00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:30.330
school." We spend a good chunk of our lives
accumulating these experiences and skills

00:23:30.330 --> 00:23:38.520
and so I wouldn't say we don't have a lot
of information, I think it actually is not

00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:44.340
only a significant amount of information,
I think it's very important to people. It's

00:23:44.340 --> 00:23:53.880
just in this context. That's how people want
to present it.

00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:59.450
&gt;&gt;Kara: Can you imagine having more information
there? Like, more pictures, videos, things

00:23:59.450 --> 00:24:00.480
like that?

00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:08.060
&gt;&gt;Adam: To be honest, we're very, we react
what our users want. So I think that as more

00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:14.960
and more users want more rich content, we'll
probably provide more rich content. But really

00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:30.200
it responds to what do people feel like they
need to represent themselves professionally

00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:38.880
online. To date, that hasn't involved a lot
of that rich media.

00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:39.910
&gt;&gt;Kara: Mm-hmm.

00:24:39.910 --> 00:24:46.630
&gt;&gt;Adam: People don't feel like they need to
represent themselves professionally with photo

00:24:46.630 --> 00:24:49.840
albums of their kids or that sort of thing.

00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:50.840
&gt;&gt;Kara: Right, right.

00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:55.400
&gt;&gt;Adam: I don't think that that's likely.

00:24:55.400 --> 00:25:06.770
&gt;&gt;Kara: Right, that's what I think. Let's
move on to, from, before you get into privacy,

00:25:06.770 --> 00:25:20.670
what do you think the greatest mistake has
b-, by your own company, by another thing

00:25:20.670 --> 00:25:36.710
that has been a, the greatest mistake made
in this area so far? Chris, you start.

00:25:36.710 --> 00:25:51.130
&gt;&gt;Chris: You know, I'm, I'm new at Google
so I don't have like, a whole long legacy,

00:25:51.130 --> 00:26:04.000
but I think one of the things that was very
interesting to,

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:09.570
to watch unfold was the interesting, the collapsing
of context with Buzz and Gmail. So, we use

00:26:09.570 --> 00:26:17.200
Buzz internally at Google, to great effect
I think. And it's been a very, very positive

00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:22.680
thing, especially when I first started working
at Google, it was a great way to learn about

00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:24.381
my coworkers and learn what was going on.

00:26:24.381 --> 00:26:25.381
[clears throat]

00:26:25.381 --> 00:26:28.680
One of the things that's very interesting
about dogfooding a lot of these things is

00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:38.370
that we learn about the products early. We
try them out. We get great use cases. And

00:26:38.370 --> 00:26:47.590
we have a very clear, I think, idea about
how email works and how Buzz works and things

00:26:47.590 --> 00:26:51.970
like that and so, watching peoples, I guess,
questions about--

00:26:51.970 --> 00:26:55.530
&gt;&gt;Kara: I would say horror, but go ahead.

00:26:55.530 --> 00:27:04.870
&gt;&gt;Chris: Questions about the way that they
interpreted Buzz being in their inbox was

00:27:04.870 --> 00:27:15.930
something that was fascinating, I guess. Because
it's like, oh, like people expect that if

00:27:15.930 --> 00:27:24.010
there's this public context within an inbox
then all of a sudden their inbox is gonna

00:27:24.010 --> 00:27:31.920
be made public as well. And, of course, that's
not the case and never was the case, but there

00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:38.070
were a lot of people that had that concern.
And I think that there's also a greater context

00:27:38.070 --> 00:27:42.220
where there's been conversations happening
about Facebook and about Twitter and about

00:27:42.220 --> 00:27:43.600
all these other social services where people
just hadn't anticipated this type of social

00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:47.042
environment to be merged in this very different
type of social environment.

00:27:47.042 --> 00:27:50.460
&gt;&gt;Kara: Well, it's the way you got in, the
way you're trying to get in. Facebook has

00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:56.130
sort of run away with the other part. Right?

00:27:56.130 --> 00:28:04.350
&gt;&gt;Chris: You said it. So, I think it's been
interesting to see that unfold and I, I, one

00:28:04.350 --> 00:28:10.710
of the things that I'm most excited about
with the APIs is to actually allow people

00:28:10.710 --> 00:28:15.140
to build external and different context for
the, the Buzz experience--

00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:16.140
&gt;&gt;Kara: Ok.

00:28:16.140 --> 00:28:21.900
&gt;&gt;Chris: that can give people a different
type of social expectation or social environment

00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:25.600
in which to conduct their daily activity.

00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:33.030
&gt;&gt;Kara: Do you think it was a question of
communication, or that Google people just

00:28:33.030 --> 00:28:36.630
aren't like other people, regular people?

00:28:36.630 --> 00:28:37.630
[laughter]

00:28:37.630 --> 00:28:38.630
&gt;&gt;Chris: I think--

00:28:38.630 --> 00:28:50.970
&gt;&gt;Kara: I'm saying the last one is true no
matter how you slice it, but what do you think

00:28:50.970 --> 00:28:52.490
the problem was?

00:28:52.490 --> 00:29:07.970
&gt;&gt;Chris: There's something special about Googlers,
for sure. But I think, I think there's also

00:29:07.970 --> 00:29:19.520
a different type of expectation and desire
that a lot of us have at Google to be able

00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:23.050
to share one another.

00:29:23.050 --> 00:29:35.120
&gt;&gt;Kara: Your test group of dogfood eating
was not a usual group of people.

00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:46.110
&gt;&gt;Chris: It was, for someone new to Google,
it was very eye opening.

00:29:46.110 --> 00:29:49.420
&gt;&gt;Kara: Mm-hmm, ok.

00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:54.470
&gt;&gt;Neil: You know, I think one of the interesting
things about Yahoo is that, you know, collapsing

00:29:54.470 --> 00:29:58.960
context is, is not just an exception like
Buzz and, and Gmail kind of combination. It's

00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:04.230
more like, you know, taking ev--, a scoop
of everything at Baskin-Robbins and, and putting

00:30:04.230 --> 00:30:10.400
it in a blender and then mixing in some motor
oil and then saying, "Mmm, drink this."

00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:11.400
[Kara laughs]

00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:12.720
You know, yeah, they did. It is, it's a new
product. The McSlurry.

00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:13.860
[audience laughs]

00:30:13.860 --> 00:30:21.280
But, you know, the interesting thing is, you
know, we had these; we had listings properties,

00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:30.250
right? Where, where folks where they're at
Hotjobs. You know, you were there for sort

00:30:30.250 --> 00:30:39.300
of this commercial intent job seeking. We
had Yahoo Personals where you were there looking

00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:44.610
for somebody but you sure as hell didn't want
anyone to know you were looking for somebody.

00:30:44.610 --> 00:30:52.270
And then we have email. And then have photos
in the form of Flickr. And then we have media

00:30:52.270 --> 00:30:57.370
experiences where sometimes it's programmed
and other times it's sharing, it's groups,

00:30:57.370 --> 00:31:05.100
it's answers, it's message boards, it's all
these sorts of things. And so the biggest

00:31:05.100 --> 00:31:13.720
challenge, and I think, the thing that we
never really have solved and, and has again,

00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:24.630
led to some of our conservativism is it's
seemingly impossible to cross all of those

00:31:24.630 --> 00:31:42.200
streams. Is that if you start with a sort
of vertical notion, you know, whether it's,

00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:52.230
it's sort of LinkedIn, right? It's, its business
oriented, it's very specific, the purpose

00:31:52.230 --> 00:31:59.480
is there. Or even Twitter where it's a channel.
You just say, "Look, I've got a channel and

00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:03.700
I'll let the user program it in any way they
want." It's, it's fairly straightforward to

00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:11.651
go ahead and manage that. And so I think one
of the reasons we've been slower and, and

00:32:11.651 --> 00:32:15.850
have missed other opportunities, if you will,
that other folks have captured, like 360,

00:32:15.850 --> 00:32:21.750
is that it, there's no compatible way to mix
all of the Yahoo pieces together. And so I

00:32:21.750 --> 00:32:24.950
think that remains a challenge.

00:32:24.950 --> 00:32:28.740
&gt;&gt;Kara: It wasn't confusing to the user.

00:32:28.740 --> 00:32:32.490
&gt;&gt;Neil: Right. It wasn't confusing and therefore,
we didn't do it, right?

00:32:32.490 --> 00:32:40.180
&gt;&gt;Kara: Cause it does freak them out. I remember
when Facebook went on The Huffington Post

00:32:40.180 --> 00:32:49.490
and think, and I didn't turn the thing off
and I wasn't in stealth mode and then I realized,

00:32:49.490 --> 00:32:54.680
everyone realizes, all I read is Brittney
Spears' stories and Lindsey Lohan's stories,

00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:55.680
so.

00:32:55.680 --> 00:32:56.680
&gt;&gt;Neil: We knew.

00:32:56.680 --> 00:32:57.680
[laughter]

00:32:57.680 --> 00:33:01.620
&gt;&gt;Kara: I know you knew, but, arrested! She's
getting, she is, by the way.

00:33:01.620 --> 00:33:02.620
[laughter]

00:33:02.620 --> 00:33:06.840
When she enters the state again, she'll be
in jail, deservedly. So, but I mean, I think

00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:12.010
it was the lack of; it doesn't mix. I was
just reading The Huffington Post and all of

00:33:12.010 --> 00:33:16.070
a sudden I was sharing my strange predilections
on celebrities and--

00:33:16.070 --> 00:33:26.710
&gt;&gt;Neil: Right. And you know, we, we had an
internal discussion recently about Facebook-like

00:33:26.710 --> 00:33:40.330
buttons. You know, the thing is when you share
something on Yahoo, i--, it's not as bad as

00:33:40.330 --> 00:33:52.190
here you're stalker buddy is gonna see it,
but we, you know, we are sort of in your face.

00:33:52.190 --> 00:34:15.539
It's a proactive notification and there's
a message that says, "This is who it's gonna

00:34:15.539 --> 00:34:34.079
go to." If we were to take, you know, like
buttons and put them all over our media pages

00:34:34.079 --> 00:34:49.139
or sports or you wanted to like a team or
like a sports figure, there's no notification.

00:34:49.139 --> 00:35:01.049
It's a different model and so, so maybe it's
ok for those users for a while until you know,

00:35:01.049 --> 00:35:02.940
again, the next, the next--

00:35:02.940 --> 00:35:04.230
&gt;&gt;Kara: They realize.

00:35:04.230 --> 00:35:14.240
&gt;&gt;Neil: the next boo-boo or mistake happens,
but you know, we found that even the open

00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:24.380
parts of the Web are a bit more promiscuous
than our users are willing to take.

00:35:24.380 --> 00:35:29.400
&gt;&gt;Kara: What about at MySpace or anywhere
else?

00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:34.000
&gt;&gt;Chris Cole: So, I would say--

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:36.299
[audience member coughs]

00:35:36.299 --> 00:35:46.801
with regards to privacy, there's probably
two mistakes I've seen over the years. The

00:35:46.801 --> 00:36:01.529
first one would be to initially over allow
photos and things that should be private to

00:36:01.529 --> 00:36:10.290
get out there. Like, early on you alluded
to a lot of the problems with the under 18

00:36:10.290 --> 00:36:15.339
versus over 18 and then how do you manage
privacy between these groups. And because

00:36:15.339 --> 00:36:25.520
of those early mistakes, the company overcorrected
and has been very conservative in how we allow

00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:28.470
people to share. And in some ways, I think
we put in undue friction, like when we initially

00:36:28.470 --> 00:36:32.750
launched the Developer Platform one was allowed
to invite one friend at a time to share some

00:36:32.750 --> 00:36:39.500
sort of game or app with them. And the reaction
was developers found workarounds to that that

00:36:39.500 --> 00:36:45.640
were incredibly annoying to the user and we've
missed on opportunities like Twitters broadcast

00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:48.960
channel that perhaps we would've been really
well positioned to have taken advantage of

00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:50.910
had we continually re-examined this notion
of privacy. So, it's, it's a really hard line

00:36:50.910 --> 00:36:57.829
to walk where you're private enough that you're
not damaging your user base but public enough

00:36:57.829 --> 00:37:01.279
that you're allowing people to have social
experiences.

00:37:01.279 --> 00:37:08.980
&gt;&gt;Adam: Yeah, you know when I think of different
challenges we've had here, actually we similar

00:37:08.980 --> 00:37:18.470
to Yahoo may have had a little bit of the
reverse where. I'm very excited that we were

00:37:18.470 --> 00:37:24.859
able to launch the open developer platform
with LinkedIn around Thanksgiving; that was

00:37:24.859 --> 00:37:33.119
only about six months ago. Until then, you
know, people who wanted to build business

00:37:33.119 --> 00:37:42.161
applications or other applications to integrate
with LinkedIn, they either had to queue up

00:37:42.161 --> 00:37:53.690
and wait for personal attention, which, of
course, being a small company was hard to

00:37:53.690 --> 00:38:04.600
provide. Or they'd have to find another way
through the shadows, through the grey areas.

00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:14.950
And you know, everyone knows, we're all very
clever. We can come up with clever ways to

00:38:14.950 --> 00:38:24.240
solve these problems. You know, one of the
benefits of having an open platform now means

00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:36.640
that first of all, our users have come to
expect that they've invested a lot of time

00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:42.440
in their LinkedIn identities; they don't really
understand why all applications don't have

00:38:42.440 --> 00:38:49.619
access to that information. They expect that
if they give permission they should be able

00:38:49.619 --> 00:38:57.279
to access that anywhere on the Web. But more
importantly, it brings that activity in to

00:38:57.279 --> 00:39:12.180
the light. Right now, people are using a real,
robust authentication system. People are now

00:39:12.180 --> 00:39:28.880
putting all that activity through in a way
that our standards for privacy can be enforced

00:39:28.880 --> 00:39:47.029
across all those interactions. So, while I'm
very proud that we have that open platform

00:39:47.029 --> 00:40:15.390
today and we're actively working on improving
it and expanding it, I think it was a mistake

00:40:15.390 --> 00:40:35.289
to not have it until six months ago. I mean,
there were a lot of things we were figuring

00:40:35.289 --> 00:40:49.660
out, but I'm glad that we have it now.

00:40:49.660 --> 00:41:11.770
&gt;&gt;Angus: A few people have talked about missed
opportunities and I think that what I would

00:41:11.770 --> 00:41:31.619
like to see more of is actually spending time
together working on these complex problems.

00:41:31.619 --> 00:41:50.700
So, like, I was just at an Internet Identity
workshop earlier this week down at the Computer

00:41:50.700 --> 00:41:56.019
History Museum and there were like, key people
from each of the large and small online services

00:41:56.019 --> 00:42:01.400
all in one place. That should be where like,
I personally wanna drag my engineers down

00:42:01.400 --> 00:42:07.340
to. I wanna spend more time, I wanna get more
people from these companies to spend more

00:42:07.340 --> 00:42:12.890
time and I think that's the, that's both a
challenge and it's also a competitive edge--

00:42:12.890 --> 00:42:21.410
&gt;&gt;Kara: I like that coming from Microsoft.
You mean you regret being a bully for all

00:42:21.410 --> 00:42:22.410
those years.

00:42:22.410 --> 00:42:23.410
[laughter]

00:42:23.410 --> 00:42:32.269
You should. Just sayin'. It's so funny, Microsoft
is so friendly now, it's really hard, I covered

00:42:32.269 --> 00:42:39.069
the Microsoft-, I covered the Microsoft trial;
you weren't always so friendly, just FYI.

00:42:39.069 --> 00:42:50.059
But, it's nice. It's Angus. It's the accent,
anyone, it's Scottish, right? Yeah, anyone

00:42:50.059 --> 00:42:53.250
who talks Scottish to me, I'm like, "Oh, you're
so nice."

00:42:53.250 --> 00:42:54.890
&gt;&gt;Angus: I'm Australian. Come on!

00:42:54.890 --> 00:42:55.890
[laughter]

00:42:55.890 --> 00:42:57.849
&gt;&gt;Kara: Ok, that's good, whatever. OH! Oh,
no!

00:42:57.849 --> 00:42:58.859
&gt;&gt;Angus: Are you Canadian?

00:42:58.859 --> 00:43:01.000
&gt;&gt;Kara: Right, I like Australians, too.

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:02.000
[laughter]

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:07.060
No, I'm not Canadian. Although, I was married
in Canada, not that anyone cares, but anyway.

00:43:07.060 --> 00:43:08.060
[laughter]

00:43:08.060 --> 00:43:14.819
&gt;&gt;Ryan: You know, I, I think we're still going
through a learning, we're s-, I think such

00:43:14.819 --> 00:43:20.259
a different model, we're still trying to figure
out where the edges of it are and what mistakes

00:43:20.259 --> 00:43:25.819
we're making. I think some of ours aren't
gonna show up for a little while longer, but

00:43:25.819 --> 00:43:27.330
it's still sort of--

00:43:27.330 --> 00:43:33.290
&gt;&gt;Kara: You fail well. I go right to fail
well.

00:43:33.290 --> 00:43:36.869
&gt;&gt;Ryan: Well, that's too obvious sometimes--

00:43:36.869 --> 00:43:41.650
&gt;&gt;Kara: Not really, but a pretty big mistake.

00:43:41.650 --> 00:43:51.190
&gt;&gt;Ryan: And there's all sorts of company learning's,
but if we're talking about the social aspect

00:43:51.190 --> 00:43:57.650
of it, I think some of that is still yet to
be determined and allowing applications to

00:43:57.650 --> 00:44:04.460
like, for you to give trusting applications
they can essentially go do anything for your

00:44:04.460 --> 00:44:12.670
account. We've kind of fought very strongly
to keep away these like, very discreet permissions

00:44:12.670 --> 00:44:20.970
around this app can do this and this app can
do that because, I think, we don't wanna get

00:44:20.970 --> 00:44:26.440
into that kind of checkbox fever of like--

00:44:26.440 --> 00:44:36.040
&gt;&gt;Kara: The only thing is it becomes third
party applications then you do one, say that.

00:44:36.040 --> 00:44:45.079
Because those, that's not Twitter, necessarily,
I mean, that's an issue on Facebook when you

00:44:45.079 --> 00:44:52.599
give permission to third parties if you don't
know who they are.

00:44:52.599 --> 00:45:03.279
&gt;&gt;Ryan: Well, well, and so we, I go about
that the other way. I think trying to give

00:45:03.279 --> 00:45:17.499
the granular permissions to apps up-front
aren't the right way to go; it's more about

00:45:17.499 --> 00:45:26.390
policing them and using trust models within
social graphs, trying to understand which

00:45:26.390 --> 00:45:33.349
apps you trust as opposed to saying, "This
app can do these things--

00:45:33.349 --> 00:45:39.609
&gt;&gt;Kara: But the company should be the one
determining who's trustworthy.

00:45:39.609 --> 00:46:02.069
&gt;&gt;Ryan: No, I think it's the users and the
set of users that determine which apps are

00:46:02.069 --> 00:46:15.819
trustworthy. We actually even backed this
idea of expectations in our privacy policy,

00:46:15.819 --> 00:46:30.539
we've said, like "Don't surprise users with
anything you do and if you surprise them for

00:46:30.539 --> 00:46:42.920
any reason, like Tweet on their behalf and
you didn't make it clear enough and you thought

00:46:42.920 --> 00:46:57.700
you made it clear enough, but if they're still
surprised, we have the ability to revoke your

00:46:57.700 --> 00:46:58.700
application."

00:46:58.700 --> 00:47:06.430
&gt;&gt;Kara: Let's talk about mobile; where we're
going with mobile. This sort of geo-, I think

00:47:06.430 --> 00:47:09.960
it was combined with Geolocation and mobile,
where that's going. And we'll finish up talking

00:47:09.960 --> 00:47:20.489
about, and we'll get to questions about where
things, sort of where it's all going and,

00:47:20.489 --> 00:47:28.759
and even, you know, there's so many social
networks and so many choices people have to

00:47:28.759 --> 00:47:37.320
join now. You have to be on Foursquare, then
you're on Facebook, and then you're on MySpace.

00:47:37.320 --> 00:47:43.160
It, it's very confusing for users I think.
We'll talk a little bit about that. Let's

00:47:43.160 --> 00:47:51.539
very quickly talk about mobile and how you
look at it. I think it's critically important;

00:47:51.539 --> 00:47:59.559
a lot of this mapping and location and it
creates a more useful experience to a lot

00:47:59.559 --> 00:48:06.670
of these social scenes. So, let me start.
How do you look at the mobile space right

00:48:06.670 --> 00:48:11.470
now? And where do you think the key, the key
players are in it?

00:48:11.470 --> 00:48:21.770
&gt;&gt;Ryan: I mean, mobile is original part mobile
is part of our DNA. I mean, that's where Twitter

00:48:21.770 --> 00:48:30.690
and the short code and the short character
count and all that stuff; it's pure mobile.

00:48:30.690 --> 00:48:31.690
We happen to have a Web service that allowed
you to surface the content. But it was about

00:48:31.690 --> 00:48:39.670
sharing things on the go, in real time, with
people pushing messages back and forth. So,

00:48:39.670 --> 00:48:45.420
everything we do have a very deep mobile consideration.
Location is something kind of near and dear

00:48:45.420 --> 00:48:57.069
to my heart, too, because I spent a bunch
of years in that. I'm really excited to see

00:48:57.069 --> 00:49:02.630
confluence of like, real time, location, and
mobile all coming together because all sorts

00:49:02.630 --> 00:49:09.989
of new use cases and experiences are gonna
come together and flourish because of those

00:49:09.989 --> 00:49:12.989
things coming together at one time.

00:49:12.989 --> 00:49:18.300
&gt;&gt;Kara: What's the most interesting use you've
seen of that so far?

00:49:18.300 --> 00:49:26.849
&gt;&gt;Ryan: Some of the ones I, I personally love
are the ones like the Food Carts and Emergency

00:49:26.849 --> 00:49:39.809
Accounts or seeing this like, real time data
that's pertinent to you because it's about

00:49:39.809 --> 00:49:56.239
the proximity in your relationship to it.
There an Emergency NSF account and there was

00:49:56.239 --> 00:50:04.550
a gas leak like two blocks away from my apartment
the other day, and I get device updates for

00:50:04.550 --> 00:50:17.480
that and granted, it was just outside of the
zone, but it's something, it's something you

00:50:17.480 --> 00:50:21.599
wanna know. I wouldn't have tapped into the
Web to notice that, so you want that to your

00:50:21.599 --> 00:50:28.799
device. It would be better if the device knew
exactly where I was and where the originating

00:50:28.799 --> 00:50:31.260
Tweet was and could make that connection easier.

00:50:31.260 --> 00:50:33.230
&gt;&gt;Kara: Get away from the gas leak.

00:50:33.230 --> 00:50:38.180
&gt;&gt;Ryan: Get away from the gas leak, yeah.
If you get this run--

00:50:38.180 --> 00:50:39.180
&gt;&gt;Kara: Run now.

00:50:39.180 --> 00:50:42.359
&gt;&gt;Ryan: Run now. We're not gonna tell you
which direction, but--

00:50:42.359 --> 00:50:43.359
[laughter]

00:50:43.359 --> 00:51:01.299
So, I think that's the kind of stuff that
I love seeing those kind of use cases come

00:51:01.299 --> 00:51:20.849
out of it. And I think we're gonna see more
and more of those as all those technologies

00:51:20.849 --> 00:51:36.660
come together. Location for so long was so
impossible to get to and now it's like, free

00:51:36.660 --> 00:51:50.460
on every major device and that is just like
game-changing in so many ways. I'm excited

00:51:50.460 --> 00:51:57.650
to see how it starts to play out.

00:51:57.650 --> 00:52:09.609
&gt;&gt;Kara: It's becoming more specific, which
is nice; really locating you nearby. One of,

00:52:09.609 --> 00:52:23.260
one of the things Walt tested once is this
thing you put on children and you locate them,

00:52:23.260 --> 00:52:34.380
except the kid was always like, three blocks
away from where it was. It was close, and

00:52:34.380 --> 00:52:40.069
the company said, "Well, it's close." And
we're all like, "Do you have children? Because

00:52:40.069 --> 00:52:45.940
if the pedophile's like three blocks away
and." And now it's becoming like, location,

00:52:45.940 --> 00:52:49.480
we're happy it's getting specific. Anyway,
so, Angus from Australia, --

00:52:49.480 --> 00:52:52.980
&gt;&gt;Angus: I'm glad you remembered my name.

00:52:52.980 --> 00:52:53.980
[laughter]

00:52:53.980 --> 00:52:55.290
&gt;&gt;Kara: I do.

00:52:55.290 --> 00:52:58.740
&gt;&gt;Angus: It's no longer Microsoft guy.

00:52:58.740 --> 00:53:05.651
&gt;&gt;Kara: Microsoft dude from Australia. Anyway,
Aussies, kangaroos, I got it. Koalas. So,

00:53:05.651 --> 00:53:07.990
shrimp on the barbie.

00:53:07.990 --> 00:53:08.990
[laughter]

00:53:08.990 --> 00:53:18.349
What, how do you look at location? You guys
are doing amazing things in mapping. I mean,

00:53:18.349 --> 00:53:25.430
in that area, Microsoft's been incredibly
aggressive and really giving Google a run

00:53:25.430 --> 00:53:34.800
for its money in terms of like, putting out
features and doing interesting stuff in mapping.

00:53:34.800 --> 00:53:44.569
So, I think you and Google are pretty, the
leaders in this area, sort of, pioneering

00:53:44.569 --> 00:53:45.569
innovations.

00:53:45.569 --> 00:53:52.849
&gt;&gt;Angus: In terms of location, I think it's,
it like, location is about exactly where you're

00:53:52.849 --> 00:53:58.430
at and that means it could be physical home.
Like, someone could stalk you if you accidentally

00:53:58.430 --> 00:54:15.079
connected to
a network that leaks it out to the public

00:54:15.079 --> 00:54:26.940
Web. That's like, real danger. So, it needs
to be watched super carefully--

00:54:26.940 --> 00:54:37.170
&gt;&gt;Kara: Well, if you leave your house. I'm
leaving my house now with my 16 iPads and

00:54:37.170 --> 00:54:42.420
that kind of thing, please, help yourself.

00:54:42.420 --> 00:54:55.140
&gt;&gt;Angus: Yeah. I think the thing that bums
me about location and mobile is that there's

00:54:55.140 --> 00:55:02.289
so many different places where my friends
spend time. So, I've got some friends on Foursquare,

00:55:02.289 --> 00:55:07.800
all the hip ones, then got some other unhip
ones on Gowalla, and some, some other services.

00:55:07.800 --> 00:55:09.550
&gt;&gt;Kara: Leave poor Gowalla alone.

00:55:09.550 --> 00:55:18.170
&gt;&gt;Angus: And, and it's hard for me to stay
across exactly what they're doing. And if

00:55:18.170 --> 00:55:23.170
I wanna be able to consume that information,
I wanna be able to bring together the places

00:55:23.170 --> 00:55:29.460
where I feel I have people I care about and
I quickly wanna get that into an easy to consume

00:55:29.460 --> 00:55:30.460
interface.

00:55:30.460 --> 00:55:34.140
&gt;&gt;Kara: So, you'd like to have that confederated
in some fashion.

00:55:34.140 --> 00:55:38.559
&gt;&gt;Angus: Yeah, and some of the stuff we've
been working on with Windows Live Messenger,

00:55:38.559 --> 00:55:43.239
in terms of bringing in things you care about
from your best friends.

00:55:43.239 --> 00:55:50.640
&gt;&gt;Kara: Your company could be one that confederated
Facebook, Google's another. I mean, in terms

00:55:50.640 --> 00:56:01.319
of there being so many of them. There's Booyah,
there's all kinds of ones you guys just did

00:56:01.319 --> 00:56:02.319
the Booyah deal.

00:56:02.319 --> 00:56:07.960
&gt;&gt;Angus: Yeah. But, we've been doing some
of this with the social networks. So, we announced

00:56:07.960 --> 00:56:09.941
a partnership with Facebook, MySpace, and
LinkedIn--

00:56:09.941 --> 00:56:13.249
&gt;&gt;Kara: And you did a Foursquare one, too,
I think.

00:56:13.249 --> 00:56:19.130
&gt;&gt;Angus: There was a brief, little demo with
Foursquare. But, once again, location is an

00:56:19.130 --> 00:56:29.619
area that you need to be careful and you pointed
out that we were down one end of the scale

00:56:29.619 --> 00:56:41.440
and I think that's probably a space that,
but, I'm not sure where we're moving in terms

00:56:41.440 --> 00:56:42.440
of location.

00:56:42.440 --> 00:56:46.739
&gt;&gt;Kara: Right. Is there other location issues
with LinkedIn?

00:56:46.739 --> 00:56:48.190
&gt;&gt;Adam: Not issues--

00:56:48.190 --> 00:56:52.450
&gt;&gt;Kara: Mass rush for this job down the street?

00:56:52.450 --> 00:56:53.450
[laughter]

00:56:53.450 --> 00:57:02.289
&gt;&gt;Adam: Yeah, well, if the economy hadn't
gone a certain way, it might have been a bigger

00:57:02.289 --> 00:57:11.470
thing. We'll probably be active in consumer
location. Events like this are part of what

00:57:11.470 --> 00:57:22.680
we hear from professionals, right? People
wanna know, not just which of their connections

00:57:22.680 --> 00:57:33.799
are here at the conference, but who are the
people they should meet at this conference?

00:57:33.799 --> 00:57:40.569
&gt;&gt;Kara: That sounds really annoying, I have
to tell you. But go ahead.

00:57:40.569 --> 00:57:51.080
&gt;&gt;Adam: Yeah, well, that cuts both ways. But,
we haven't, this is what we're hearing from

00:57:51.080 --> 00:58:02.759
users, right? You know, we haven't built a
feature like this yet, but we hear from professionals

00:58:02.759 --> 00:58:13.510
is that, there's some people who are here
from Google I/O for fun and entertainment,

00:58:13.510 --> 00:58:27.589
but most people are here because it directly
relates to what they do for a living. Their

00:58:27.589 --> 00:58:35.869
job, their profession, building their skills.
A lot of people spend their time thinking

00:58:35.869 --> 00:58:45.509
about who they can meet here, when they can
meet and that sort of thing. And we don't

00:58:45.509 --> 00:58:57.200
have all those pieces, but we do have that
professional context, we do have reputation,

00:58:57.200 --> 00:59:07.749
their connections, etc. We do think we have
a role to play to provide some of those features

00:59:07.749 --> 00:59:19.320
to make that a more productive experience.
I mean, an ideal sense, it would help you

00:59:19.320 --> 00:59:26.450
just as much to make sure that you're spending
your time with the people you should be rather

00:59:26.450 --> 00:59:35.700
than ending up spending your time with just
whomever you randomly run into, if that makes

00:59:35.700 --> 00:59:36.700
sense.

00:59:36.700 --> 00:59:42.660
&gt;&gt;Kara: Good point, that's a good point.

00:59:42.660 --> 00:59:52.720
&gt;&gt;Chris Cole: For us, is we're looking at
the trends. It, it's very clear that all of

00:59:52.720 --> 01:00:07.650
the growth is on mobile and something like
30 to 50 percent of our users are dealing

01:00:07.650 --> 01:00:17.900
with mobile devices and I think it's a majority
of status updates are coming from mobile devices.

01:00:17.900 --> 01:00:28.319
So, so it's very clear that mobility in this
always on always with you connection is really

01:00:28.319 --> 01:00:31.099
kind of, where the social--

01:00:31.099 --> 01:00:35.809
&gt;&gt;Kara: You guys are doing a lot of events
around that, about event-going--

01:00:35.809 --> 01:00:41.970
&gt;&gt;Chris Cole: Yeah. We're doing a lot of Geolocation.
Not so much at the point geolocation, at this

01:00:41.970 --> 01:00:47.950
point more of the geolocation of "you're in
this city" and then "these are the concerts

01:00:47.950 --> 01:00:56.039
coming towards you that you might be interested
in". But, but it's also interesting because

01:00:56.039 --> 01:01:11.200
I was talk-, I forget who I was talking to,
but they were looking at the usage patterns

01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:25.770
and some mobile devices are used first thing
in the morning and then very late at night

01:01:25.770 --> 01:01:40.580
right before you go to bed and the type of
content you're gonna tailor to that is gonna

01:01:40.580 --> 01:01:52.999
be very different than say, looking through
someone's photo album of their trip to the

01:01:52.999 --> 01:01:56.380
Caribbean and their marriage.

01:01:56.380 --> 01:02:04.339
&gt;&gt;Kara: Tell me something cool you've seen
it used for.

01:02:04.339 --> 01:02:11.770
&gt;&gt;Chris Cole: Well, something I haven't seen
yet, but may be out there would be location-based

01:02:11.770 --> 01:02:15.839
activity stream updates so that you could
then prioritize what's around you, stuff that's

01:02:15.839 --> 01:02:18.670
really happening. Because right now the stream
comes through and it's your friends, which

01:02:18.670 --> 01:02:19.719
there's some geolocation just naturally from
that, but something that, we consume the Twitter

01:02:19.719 --> 01:02:24.380
stream, have partnerships with a lot of people,
so we have this massive amount of data and

01:02:24.380 --> 01:02:27.109
if you could create some sort of graph notes
structure then had location and made it more

01:02:27.109 --> 01:02:29.180
relevant by location, that would be very interesting.

01:02:29.180 --> 01:02:32.710
&gt;&gt;Kara: Something through in a Firehose now
and it's somewhat relevant--

01:02:32.710 --> 01:02:34.289
&gt;&gt;Chris Cole: I mean, the Firehose is amazing,
but it is just a Firehose. You can't drink

01:02:34.289 --> 01:02:35.289
it.

01:02:35.289 --> 01:02:36.289
&gt;&gt;Kara: Ultimately irrelevant, excuse me,
relevant. I recently used Foursquare to bother

01:02:36.289 --> 01:02:37.289
Fred Wilson because he was in a restaurant
around the corner. I was just like, "Hi! Nice

01:02:37.289 --> 01:02:38.289
to see you." Freaked him out, even though
he's an investor in Foursquare. He's like,

01:02:38.289 --> 01:02:39.289
"How did you find me?" And I'm like, "You're
an idiot."

01:02:39.289 --> 01:02:40.289
[laughter]

01:02:40.289 --> 01:02:41.789
So, what about, what do you see that's interesting
in mobile? Something, some interesting use

01:02:41.789 --> 01:02:43.650
of it, or where do you imagine that?

01:02:43.650 --> 01:02:49.599
&gt;&gt;Neil: Yeah, I think, you know for Yahoo
mobile it's, it's just obvious. One of the

01:02:49.599 --> 01:02:54.559
differences for the way we do it in--

01:02:54.559 --> 01:03:05.160
&gt;&gt;Kara: You have a mobile announcement Monday.
Wanna tell us what it is?

01:03:05.160 --> 01:03:12.109
&gt;&gt;Neil: My manager would kill me.

01:03:12.109 --> 01:03:22.529
&gt;&gt;Kara: Yeah, well, I'll be writing about
it tonight.

01:03:22.529 --> 01:03:37.589
&gt;&gt;Neil: I heard when she was walking over
that you'd already gotten there.

01:03:37.589 --> 01:03:38.749
[laughter]

01:03:38.749 --> 01:03:41.059
&gt;&gt;Kara: Yeah.

01:03:41.059 --> 01:03:44.539
&gt;&gt;Neil: Suck it.

01:03:44.539 --> 01:03:45.700
[laughter]

01:03:45.700 --> 01:03:55.239
So, you know one of the interesting things
is traditionally mobile has been more of a

01:03:55.239 --> 01:03:56.960
read experience for Yahoo.

01:03:56.960 --> 01:04:02.549
&gt;&gt;Kara: Right, you guys had Yahoo Go, which
was a very, another valiant--

01:04:02.549 --> 01:04:04.259
&gt;&gt;Neil: Yeah, eh, eeh.

01:04:04.259 --> 01:04:05.259
&gt;&gt;Kara: Valiant.

01:04:05.259 --> 01:04:07.700
&gt;&gt;Neil: Marco, love him, you know.

01:04:07.700 --> 01:04:08.700
&gt;&gt;Kara: Yeah.

01:04:08.700 --> 01:04:23.250
&gt;&gt;Neil: I know he was a friend of yours, but
for us it was a read-mostly experience and

01:04:23.250 --> 01:04:27.420
so we hadn't, because we're not often writing
location except to our own APIs because you're

01:04:27.420 --> 01:04:31.009
searching for a restaurant or a review, or
you're there on search and you're drawing

01:04:31.009 --> 01:04:35.319
a picture around the neighborhood that you
want results from, you know, that kind of

01:04:35.319 --> 01:04:42.369
thing, it's not as much of a challenge in
the social space because we tend not to be

01:04:42.369 --> 01:04:47.809
exposing. Or if you look at the new iPad app,
you know, it's there about consuming media,

01:04:47.809 --> 01:04:50.410
whether it's media content, reviews, and that
sort of thing. So, for us, it's an obvious

01:04:50.410 --> 01:04:55.279
vehicle to push our content, to push our experiences,
but we haven't had the same privacy concerns

01:04:55.279 --> 01:04:58.430
because we're not generally publishing from
the devices that often. So, we use the mobile

01:04:58.430 --> 01:05:02.119
cues; use the geosignal and that sort of thing.
But it's, it's, it's far less intrusive because

01:05:02.119 --> 01:05:03.630
we don't have a, a privacy issue.

01:05:03.630 --> 01:05:05.569
&gt;&gt;Kara: What would you like to see Yahoo do?

01:05:05.569 --> 01:05:09.839
&gt;&gt;Neil: You know, in the ideal world it would
be nice to just forklift everything. That

01:05:09.839 --> 01:05:12.180
you could take Yahoo, run it through a magic
filter, and then all of a sudden it's appropriate

01:05:12.180 --> 01:05:17.250
for a two inch UI. I think, you know, there's
some promise in HTML5 and some other technologies

01:05:17.250 --> 01:05:25.140
that will get us closer to that as we move
to, to standards and, and portable development

01:05:25.140 --> 01:05:36.619
that'll work well in both places, but you
know, that's more of a technology thing than

01:05:36.619 --> 01:05:38.289
a social thing. I mean, that's the ideal is
sort of the write once, run anywhere and I

01:05:38.289 --> 01:05:45.829
don't have to care if it's on a, on an IP
TV or a set-top box, or a com-, or a full-fledged,

01:05:45.829 --> 01:05:46.829
you know PC or hack a two inch device, right?

01:05:46.829 --> 01:05:47.829
&gt;&gt;Kara: It's a nice dream.

01:05:47.829 --> 01:05:48.829
&gt;&gt;Neil: Yeah. It is. It's the Holy Grail.

01:05:48.829 --> 01:05:49.829
[laughter]

01:05:49.829 --> 01:05:50.829
&gt;&gt;Kara: The impossible dream.

01:05:50.829 --> 01:05:51.829
&gt;&gt;Neil: Yeah.

01:05:51.829 --> 01:05:52.829
&gt;&gt;Chris: Actually, on that point, I would
say that that's a nightmare. Being a designer

01:05:52.829 --> 01:05:53.829
by training, because I feel like when we separate
out mobile from other types of computing experiences,

01:05:53.829 --> 01:05:54.829
we tend to put it in this like, little bastardized
tube that like, says, you know, "Have these

01:05:54.829 --> 01:05:55.829
experiences over here and we just wanna take
all these desktop experiences and just throw

01:05:55.829 --> 01:05:56.829
them into this small two inch real estate,
and things are just gonna magically work out."

01:05:56.829 --> 01:05:57.829
And I actually think that mobile demands and
deserves a certain type of thinking that's

01:05:57.829 --> 01:05:59.599
much more contextual, that takes much less
for granted, and greatly simplifies the computing

01:05:59.599 --> 01:06:01.849
experience. So, like, awhile ago, I started
thinking about how there's this emerging trend

01:06:01.849 --> 01:06:03.890
in computing that I call "pop computing",
which is about simplifying these experiences

01:06:03.890 --> 01:06:05.009
that we take for granted that we'll have with
a mouse and a keyboard and getting them down

01:06:05.009 --> 01:06:06.009
to like, a single mouse-touch, sorry, a single
finger-touch, and that changes everything.

01:06:06.009 --> 01:06:07.009
It's a fundamental paradigm shift in, so--

01:06:07.009 --> 01:06:08.009
&gt;&gt;Kara: Well, isn't it computers, well, don't
you feel, I feel that computers are going,

01:06:08.009 --> 01:06:09.009
I mean, I have a five year old who literally
touch-, literally every screen he touches,

01:06:09.009 --> 01:06:10.009
like he bangs on it like it's like, a village--

01:06:10.009 --> 01:06:11.009
&gt;&gt;Chris: Essentially, yeah, it's, it's, he
can't touch it right? So, we have these weird,

01:06:11.009 --> 01:06:12.009
stupid screens that sit there and you like,
like, paw at them and they don't do anything

01:06:12.009 --> 01:06:13.009
and it's like, "Well, it's broken."

01:06:13.009 --> 01:06:14.009
&gt;&gt;Kara: Mm-hmm.

01:06:14.009 --> 01:06:15.009
&gt;&gt;Chris: So, in a couple years, I can imagine
people are gonna have these expectations,

01:06:15.009 --> 01:06:16.009
or they're gonna look back at us sitting in
these weird cubicles with these computers

01:06:16.009 --> 01:06:17.009
that we interact with in this way that seems
very foreign to them because they're used

01:06:17.009 --> 01:06:18.009
to having tactile experiences. So, if you
couple that tactile experience in mobile devices

01:06:18.009 --> 01:06:19.009
with location, which is all about relevancy
and what's around you, and what's very immediate

01:06:19.009 --> 01:06:20.009
to you, I think people's expectations are
changing. And so, we have to think about the

01:06:20.009 --> 01:06:21.009
context that someone's gonna find themselves
in from a social perspective, from a geographic

01:06:21.009 --> 01:06:22.009
perspective, and from an immersive sort of
like, "Are they driving while they're tapping

01:06:22.009 --> 01:06:23.009
on your device? And if so, they really should
not be having like 40 lines of text like in

01:06:23.009 --> 01:06:24.043
front of them." So, it demands a whole new
discipline and that I think we have to consider

01:06:24.043 --> 01:06:25.043
and not just port, you know, what we've had
to that.

01:06:25.043 --> 01:06:26.043
&gt;&gt;Kara: Very good point. Country-minute Nicole
Kidman? I'm just curious, Microsoft had a

01:06:26.043 --> 01:06:27.043
wonderful movie idea a couple years ago about
this idea of on-the-go, also Russell Crowe,

01:06:27.043 --> 01:06:28.043
they had a really good movie of this idea
of on-the-go computing kind of thing. Did

01:06:28.043 --> 01:06:29.043
you see it? It was called The Future of the
Future, or something like that. It was one

01:06:29.043 --> 01:06:30.043
of those great Microsoft movies of things
they're never gonna make but it looked terrific.

01:06:30.043 --> 01:06:31.043
It was like, you touch things, you move things,
you, you sweep things--

01:06:31.043 --> 01:06:32.043
&gt;&gt;Angus: Minority Report?

01:06:32.043 --> 01:06:33.043
&gt;&gt;Kara: Yeah, it was like Minority Report,
it was really cool.

01:06:33.043 --> 01:06:34.043
&gt;&gt;Angus: Yeah, I've seen a couple of things
there, but I haven't seen that one. But I've

01:06:34.043 --> 01:06:35.043
seen Office 2019: Workplace of the Future.
Actually, sorry, Chris, I was sitting next

01:06:35.043 --> 01:06:36.043
to someone with a laptop, a Windows PC, and
they were tweaking the screen yesterday. So,

01:06:36.043 --> 01:06:37.043
it happens, right?

01:06:37.043 --> 01:06:38.043
&gt;&gt;Chris: It's coming.

01:06:38.043 --> 01:06:39.339
&gt;&gt;Angus: That happens, sorry. And one last
thing, I just wanted to update. What cuts

01:06:39.339 --> 01:06:40.339
me really deep about mobile and social is
that I have a set of friends. I, I use a certain

01:06:40.339 --> 01:06:41.339
device cause it was given to me for work.
You guys use other devices because, for whatever

01:06:41.339 --> 01:06:42.339
reason. I hate that the device or the app
defines who I can interact with in a certain

01:06:42.339 --> 01:06:43.339
way.

01:06:43.339 --> 01:06:44.339
&gt;&gt;Kara: Good point.

01:06:44.339 --> 01:06:45.339
&gt;&gt;Angus: That really bums me out.

01:06:45.339 --> 01:06:46.339
&gt;&gt;Kara: That's perfect. Let's get to that:
devices. Now, let us try not to insult Apple

01:06:46.339 --> 01:06:47.339
27 times today, it's gotten a little much
today.

01:06:47.339 --> 01:06:48.339
&gt;&gt;Ryan: I love them.

01:06:48.339 --> 01:06:49.339
&gt;&gt;Kara: You do? Ok, good. Your boss not so
much. But, but, let's talk about what the

01:06:49.339 --> 01:06:50.339
important devices. That is, there have, we're
getting into this ridiculous, juvenile, typical

01:06:50.339 --> 01:06:51.339
of Silicon Valley war between all these platforms,
with Apple and Google being the most obvious,

01:06:51.339 --> 01:06:52.339
but Facebook and, and Google and all these
people in these different and all the different

01:06:52.339 --> 01:06:53.339
devices fighting with each other and then
Palm's over here dying slowly until HP buys

01:06:53.339 --> 01:06:54.339
them. How do look at, it's a good save, how
do you look at this, this idea, what you're

01:06:54.339 --> 01:06:55.339
talking about cause it's very, it's problematic
because there are all these little fascist

01:06:55.339 --> 01:06:56.339
organizations here and here and here and you
belong to the, you know, it's like the tea

01:06:56.339 --> 01:06:57.339
parties versus the crazy liberals versus the
crazy, well, the nutters, you know in this

01:06:57.339 --> 01:06:58.339
country are politics now become the nutters
running each side of the spectrum, running

01:06:58.339 --> 01:06:59.339
everything. And the people in the middle are
just vomiting, you know, quietly in their

01:06:59.339 --> 01:07:00.339
mouths.

01:07:00.339 --> 01:07:01.339
[laughter]

01:07:01.339 --> 01:07:02.339
So, how do you look at, how does this solve
itself when these devices don't, you know,

01:07:02.339 --> 01:07:03.339
my, I mean, I have a Nexus One, my, but there
is a certain use case of these things that

01:07:03.339 --> 01:07:04.339
you become this, this Apple person, or this
Google person.

01:07:04.339 --> 01:07:05.339
&gt;&gt;Angus: I think the key thing is that, first
off, Chris mentioned that the experience on

01:07:05.339 --> 01:07:06.339
mobile is key. And generally you'll see the
first party, like the service owner, they

01:07:06.339 --> 01:07:07.339
order a killer client a la Twitter. You guys
build a killer client for certain devices.

01:07:07.339 --> 01:07:08.339
And then it comes to, "Well, what other devices
do people want to build for?" And making sure

01:07:08.339 --> 01:07:09.339
that, like, as a service owner, you should
be saying, "I'm not gonna build for that device,

01:07:09.339 --> 01:07:10.339
but I'm gonna find the best person that builds
on that device and I'm gonna give them all

01:07:10.339 --> 01:07:11.339
the love and the attention so they can satisfy
the people that have friends that use my services

01:07:11.339 --> 01:07:12.339
on other devices."

01:07:12.339 --> 01:07:13.339
&gt;&gt;Kara: But you do have to choose now. A lot
of these devices, you know, even on our site,

01:07:13.339 --> 01:07:14.339
we're not gonna spend a lot of money, but
we went to the iPhone first and then we were

01:07:14.339 --> 01:07:15.339
gonna go to the Blackberry, and then we decided
to go to the Android, but here's the iPad.

01:07:15.339 --> 01:07:16.339
You know, I guess we'll go to the iPad first;
it just becomes for the developers worse and

01:07:16.339 --> 01:07:17.339
again these wars that are going on.

01:07:17.339 --> 01:07:18.339
&gt;&gt;Adam: I think, sorry, I think that this
is actually pretty important. Mobile is a

01:07:18.339 --> 01:07:19.339
big deal for us because professionals have
two things. They tend to be higher income

01:07:19.339 --> 01:07:20.339
so they can afford these latest devices and
services and they're never at their desks,

01:07:20.339 --> 01:07:21.339
so they really depend on the mobile devices.
But, I don't see the problem, the reverse

01:07:21.339 --> 01:07:22.339
there it is a problem, but it becomes an obligation
from a design standpoint. People pick their

01:07:22.339 --> 01:07:23.339
devices just for reasons and I don't think
it's wrong to ignore them, right? You know,

01:07:23.339 --> 01:07:24.339
we, we have, at least in the Android application,
we had a lower, you know, working on one--

01:07:24.339 --> 01:07:25.339
&gt;&gt;Kara: The first one was an iPhone, right?
As are most peoples.

01:07:25.339 --> 01:07:26.339
&gt;&gt;Adam: The first one was an iPhone. But you
have to ask that question, "Why do people

01:07:26.339 --> 01:07:27.339
love the iPhone?" Right? That's part of why
they chose that device and that fits into

01:07:27.339 --> 01:07:28.339
what do they need to go, like, we design our
applications. We don't say, "Well, what parts

01:07:28.339 --> 01:07:29.339
of the website can we bring onto this mobile
device?" Its, "We have a mobile professional.

01:07:29.339 --> 01:07:30.339
What do they need to get done one the go,
quickly, easily. And how can we bring it to

01:07:30.339 --> 01:07:31.339
them in a way that they're truly gonna enjoy?"
The, the, a mobile device, like a PC, is a

01:07:31.339 --> 01:07:32.339
very personal device. It knows everyone you're
connected to, you pick it and there's this,

01:07:32.339 --> 01:07:33.339
and the tactile thing makes it even more personal,
so it may be a problem in terms of you can't

01:07:33.339 --> 01:07:34.339
possibly build your app for a hundred different
devices, but for me, at least from the design

01:07:34.339 --> 01:07:35.339
perspective, it feels very important to make
sure that if you're gonna build an application

01:07:35.339 --> 01:07:36.339
for Android, it's gotta be a great Android
application.

01:07:36.339 --> 01:07:37.339
&gt;&gt;Kara: I'm talking about the ability of being
in the silos--

01:07:37.339 --> 01:07:38.339
&gt;&gt;Adam: Yeah.

01:07:38.339 --> 01:07:39.339
&gt;&gt;Kara: which is the opposite of open--

01:07:39.339 --> 01:07:40.339
&gt;&gt;Chris Cole: I think in, in this crowd in
particular, we talk about ok, iPhone versus

01:07:40.339 --> 01:07:41.339
Android and whatnot. And we're ignoring this
entire class of devices out there that we

01:07:41.339 --> 01:07:42.339
have a much younger skew on our user base.
So, these aren't people that can walk out

01:07:42.339 --> 01:07:43.339
and plop down two hundred dollars for a device.
You know, you live in Silicon Valley, you

01:07:43.339 --> 01:07:44.339
live in Seattle--

01:07:44.339 --> 01:07:45.339
&gt;&gt;Kara: You're talking about the [inaudible]
phones.

01:07:45.339 --> 01:07:46.339
&gt;&gt;Chris Cole: You walk around and everyone's
got their iPhones in their hand and more and

01:07:46.339 --> 01:07:47.339
more you see a lot of Androids. And the reality
is that you're ignoring a significant portion

01:07:47.339 --> 01:07:48.339
of the population if you don't look at the
older feature phones and the WAP browsers

01:07:48.339 --> 01:07:49.339
and what they can do. And this is, I would
say, I wish I had committed all these statistics

01:07:49.339 --> 01:07:50.339
to memory, but it was close to the 50 percent
mark, over or under or older WAP devices that

01:07:50.339 --> 01:07:51.339
are connecting to our site. And, you know,
we talk about what we're doing, but particularly

01:07:51.339 --> 01:07:52.339
in a social situation, you're trying to get
information and interaction out as wide as

01:07:52.339 --> 01:07:53.339
possible so even if you're going and hitting
all the smart phones, you're still completely

01:07:53.339 --> 01:07:54.339
ignoring a huge portion of the market.

01:07:54.339 --> 01:07:55.339
&gt;&gt;Kara: Yeah, but at the same time though,
although, although the trend is towards these

01:07:55.339 --> 01:07:56.339
smart phones--

01:07:56.339 --> 01:07:57.339
&gt;&gt;Chris Cole: Clearly that's where it's going,
but it's still a couple years out.

01:07:57.339 --> 01:07:58.339
&gt;&gt;Kara: I mean, everyone's gonna have one.
I mean young and old people, as soon as they,

01:07:58.339 --> 01:07:59.339
you know, we're showing ten tablets of [inaudible]
in a week, you know? And there's, and they're

01:07:59.339 --> 01:08:00.339
gonna be cheap and eventually go down and,
you know, with the Kin, by the way, the Kin

01:08:00.339 --> 01:08:01.339
was on Gossip Girl the other night. That was
fascinating. That idiot, Chase Crawford, was

01:08:01.339 --> 01:08:02.339
trying to, anyway. But it was cool to see.
But, but, people will have smart phones; so

01:08:02.339 --> 01:08:03.339
therefore, it does become this kind of thing.
We're gonna go to questions now, but what's

01:08:03.339 --> 01:08:04.339
the most important device right now in the
mobile space? You first.

01:08:04.339 --> 01:08:05.339
&gt;&gt;Chris: Wow. That's a terrible question.

01:08:05.339 --> 01:08:06.339
&gt;&gt;Kara: No, it's not. It's a great one.

01:08:06.339 --> 01:08:07.339
&gt;&gt;Chris: Well, actually I'm really excited
about the, the Chrome TV today. The Google

01:08:07.339 --> 01:08:08.339
TV in the sense that it's not a mobile device
but in the sense that it takes the Android

01:08:08.339 --> 01:08:09.339
platform, pushes it into a new environment
and provides this way of actually doing this

01:08:09.339 --> 01:08:10.339
cross platform development that, to me, working
on identity for the last couple of years--

01:08:10.339 --> 01:08:11.339
&gt;&gt;Kara: Tough area. People have tried. This
has been a battlefield--

01:08:11.339 --> 01:08:12.339
&gt;&gt;Chris: raises, and it raises a lot of questions
about how you actually like, sit like, take

01:08:12.339 --> 01:08:13.339
an Android device, interact with your TV,
bring that into other places and contacts

01:08:13.339 --> 01:08:14.339
and so on. It's forcing the boundaries of
these things to actually congeal in ways that

01:08:14.339 --> 01:08:15.339
are unnatural, so.

01:08:15.339 --> 01:08:16.339
&gt;&gt;Kara: It's a tough buts, it's taken many
prisoners in this particular area over the

01:08:16.339 --> 01:08:17.339
years.

01:08:17.339 --> 01:08:18.339
&gt;&gt;Neil: Yes, you know, I'll, I'll cop out
on this one. I think the answer is whatever

01:08:18.339 --> 01:08:19.339
is in the consumer's pocket.

01:08:19.339 --> 01:08:20.339
&gt;&gt;Kara: Oh, good God.

01:08:20.339 --> 01:08:21.339
&gt;&gt;Neil: Is you have to, you have to deliver
your app and, and so I'll give my own story--

01:08:21.339 --> 01:08:22.339
&gt;&gt;Kara: Short. We gotta get to questions.

01:08:22.339 --> 01:08:23.339
&gt;&gt;Neil: In this pocket, it's the iPhone, and
in this pocket, it's the Blackberry, right?

01:08:23.339 --> 01:08:24.339
But with the iPhone, with the car I bought
recently, one of the features it had to have

01:08:24.339 --> 01:08:25.339
was an iPhone jack. And why does it need an
iPhone? Well, cause I read more on my Kindle

01:08:25.339 --> 01:08:26.339
now on the iPhone. I actually, Rhapsody plays
on the Phonos, the TiVo, and oh yeah, it plays

01:08:26.339 --> 01:08:27.339
on the iPhone. And so the interesting thing
I think, is that when you get convergence,

01:08:27.339 --> 01:08:28.339
you know, for me the, the phone isn't an end,
it's a means to get to the stuff that's interesting

01:08:28.339 --> 01:08:29.339
and I think the approach we have to take is,
you know, sometimes we call them Hero Devices

01:08:29.339 --> 01:08:30.339
in the industry, is we focus on those devices
because they're gonna enable so much for users.

01:08:30.339 --> 01:08:31.339
And, and you know, you can again try to leverage
whatever you have into a WAP device. But,

01:08:31.339 --> 01:08:32.339
at the same time, I think it's important to
say, "Look, I can carry the entire ecosystem

01:08:32.339 --> 01:08:33.339
of this user, I can do a better job, I can
get them their music, I can get them their

01:08:33.339 --> 01:08:34.339
content, I can get them the books, whether
its DRM or not, yadda, yadda, yadda." So,

01:08:34.339 --> 01:08:35.339
I think whatever consumers have, if you can
bring your experience there, that's how you

01:08:35.339 --> 01:08:36.339
win. It's about the experience existing on
the device and if you can't carry it to the

01:08:36.339 --> 01:08:37.339
device, then, you know, it's not that interesting.

01:08:37.339 --> 01:08:38.339
&gt;&gt;Kara: Next. Very briefly so I can get to
questions.

01:08:38.339 --> 01:08:39.339
&gt;&gt;Chris Cole: I, I think, putting on my developer
hat, it has to be the iPad because it brings

01:08:39.339 --> 01:08:40.339
in the whole tablet form factor. It's, you
know, ten months ago it was, "Oh my Lord,

01:08:40.339 --> 01:08:41.339
we have a, a three and a half orange screen
that we have to program for." And now it's

01:08:41.339 --> 01:08:42.339
this, it's created this new level of uncertainty,
you know, it's hard enough that the Droid

01:08:42.339 --> 01:08:43.339
has a different aspect ratio from the G2 or
the Ion phone and now it's like, "Oh, well,

01:08:43.339 --> 01:08:44.339
that's the least of our concerns." So, how
is that answer gonna come? Now you're gonna

01:08:44.339 --> 01:08:45.339
be developing a Web application, an iPhone
application, an Android application, an iPad

01:08:45.339 --> 01:08:46.339
application, a Google TV application, and
no, now we're getting screens in cars so you're

01:08:46.339 --> 01:08:47.339
developing a, one for the Volt in the backseat.
So, it's just, it's this uncertainty in how

01:08:47.339 --> 01:08:48.339
developers are going to address this a figure
out either increasing their efforts to bring

01:08:48.339 --> 01:08:49.339
in clients and all kinds of new experiences.
Is it gonna be market segmentation, it's just

01:08:49.339 --> 01:08:50.339
a, it just point, it puts a finger on disruptive
these new devices are gonna be.

01:08:50.339 --> 01:08:51.339
&gt;&gt;Kara: Very confusing. Very briefly do you
wanna say something sorry.

01:08:51.339 --> 01:08:52.339
&gt;&gt;Adam: Yeah?

01:08:52.339 --> 01:08:53.339
&gt;&gt;Kara: Quick.

01:08:53.339 --> 01:08:54.339
&gt;&gt;Adam: Huh?

01:08:54.339 --> 01:08:55.339
&gt;&gt;Kara: Quick, quick.

01:08:55.339 --> 01:08:56.339
&gt;&gt;Adam: iPad, different reason. I think that
the iPad is a signal of everything effectively

01:08:56.339 --> 01:08:57.339
becoming a mobile device, not just the traditional
things we think of as phones. I think of the

01:08:57.339 --> 01:08:58.339
use cases of someone with an iPad, someone
with an iPhone, someone with an Android device,

01:08:58.339 --> 01:08:59.339
how they are wrapped together I think bring
the power of mobile computing to all devices.

01:08:59.339 --> 01:09:00.339
I didn't think I'd have to think that hard
about it. When the iPad was announced when

01:09:00.339 --> 01:09:01.339
I got one, I'd been playing with it for a
few weeks. It's a big deal. So--

01:09:01.339 --> 01:09:02.339
&gt;&gt;Kara: Some of the others coming out are
very exciting.

01:09:02.339 --> 01:09:03.339
&gt;&gt;Adam: Absolutely.

01:09:03.339 --> 01:09:04.339
&gt;&gt;Angus: I'm pretty jazzed about the Windows
Phone 7.

01:09:04.339 --> 01:09:05.339
&gt;&gt;Kara: Of course you are.

01:09:05.339 --> 01:09:06.339
[laughter]

01:09:06.339 --> 01:09:07.339
&gt;&gt;Angus: I'm particularly jazzed--

01:09:07.339 --> 01:09:08.339
&gt;&gt;Kara: Keep, keep trying.

01:09:08.339 --> 01:09:09.339
&gt;&gt;Angus: because I have one of a handful in
my backpack, so I'm pretty happy about it.

01:09:09.339 --> 01:09:10.339
&gt;&gt;Kara: Yeah.

01:09:10.339 --> 01:09:11.339
&gt;&gt;Angus: And what I really actually like about
it is what I've been working on with Windows

01:09:11.339 --> 01:09:12.339
Live, is bringing together other, like, other
places where I spend time connecting to Windows

01:09:12.339 --> 01:09:13.339
Live. When I turned on my Windows Phone 7
and connected it to my Live account, including

01:09:13.339 --> 01:09:14.339
my Facebook account, I saw the activities
that I see in Messenger and I see in HotMail,

01:09:14.339 --> 01:09:15.339
which were just announced. I saw those, but
on the phone, in the right context. When I

01:09:15.339 --> 01:09:16.339
flipped the photos, I saw it in a really nice
way. And I was just like, "Wow, I can stay

01:09:16.339 --> 01:09:17.339
across what all my friends are doing on this
device just as well."

01:09:17.339 --> 01:09:18.339
&gt;&gt;Kara: It's called the iPhone, but great.

01:09:18.339 --> 01:09:19.339
[laughter]

01:09:19.339 --> 01:09:20.339
I'm teasing.

01:09:20.339 --> 01:09:21.339
&gt;&gt;Angus: You don't get to see it.

01:09:21.339 --> 01:09:22.339
&gt;&gt;Kara: Crocodile Dundee, I do too.

01:09:22.339 --> 01:09:23.339
[laughter]

01:09:23.339 --> 01:09:24.339
I've already seen it.

01:09:24.339 --> 01:09:25.339
&gt;&gt;Ryan: I'm kind of surprised no one here
has actually mentioned SMS. We're talking

01:09:25.339 --> 01:09:26.339
about smart phones and addressable markets,
and SMS is billions of people, not tens or

01:09:26.339 --> 01:09:27.339
hundreds of millions; billions of people.
And it might not be as high fidelity, but

01:09:27.339 --> 01:09:28.339
some--

01:09:28.339 --> 01:09:29.339
&gt;&gt;Kara: Ok, great.

01:09:29.339 --> 01:09:30.339
&gt;&gt;Ryan: of the most important messages are.

01:09:30.339 --> 01:09:31.339
&gt;&gt;Kara: Ok, questions? Please be questions
because I'm forcing these guys. Anybody?

01:09:31.339 --> 01:09:32.339
&gt;&gt;audience2: Going back to the privacy question,
you mentioned that we shouldn't surprise users.

01:09:32.339 --> 01:09:33.339
The problem is what happens when you don't
even know the impact? For example, the fact

01:09:33.339 --> 01:09:34.339
that once you publish something, you may be
sure that you want it to go out on Twitter

01:09:34.339 --> 01:09:35.339
to everyone; you're fine with that. But then
this thing gets archived, its searchable--

01:09:35.339 --> 01:09:36.339
&gt;&gt;Kara: Right.

01:09:36.339 --> 01:09:37.339
&gt;&gt;male audience member #2: long time later
someone find some innocent looking comment

01:09:37.339 --> 01:09:38.339
and they take it totally out of context and
that's bound to surprise people later on.

01:09:38.339 --> 01:09:39.339
So how do you deal with that? How do you make
sure that people understand that, you know,

01:09:39.339 --> 01:09:40.339
a shard snippet today may make sense based
on the context people have about you, but

01:09:40.339 --> 01:09:41.339
then--

01:09:41.339 --> 01:09:42.339
&gt;&gt;Kara: Ok, one person answer that? Who wants
to answer that?

01:09:42.339 --> 01:09:43.339
[pause]

01:09:43.339 --> 01:09:44.339
Google guy.

01:09:44.339 --> 01:09:45.339
&gt;&gt;Chris: So, I think, on the, on the one hand,
there's gonna be a generational shift and

01:09:45.339 --> 01:09:46.339
part of it is, is learning how these tools
work and unfortunately its gonna take a lot

01:09:46.339 --> 01:09:47.339
of the media hyping that's going on now to
get people to tune in to this conversation

01:09:47.339 --> 01:09:48.339
to become more aware of it. So, there's no
perfect answer today, but I do think people

01:09:48.339 --> 01:09:49.339
are going to learn one way or another.

01:09:49.339 --> 01:09:50.339
&gt;&gt;Kara: Yeah, I think it's never, it's never
coming back. I think it's out there and gone

01:09:50.339 --> 01:09:51.339
forever. There's a New York Post story on
my pregnancy that I wish I could get rid of.

01:09:51.339 --> 01:09:52.339
[laughter]

01:09:52.339 --> 01:09:53.339
&gt;&gt;female audience member #1: Hi. I have a
question for all of you actually because one

01:09:53.339 --> 01:09:54.339
of the things that I find is missing in all
the social networks today is actually a way

01:09:54.339 --> 01:09:55.339
in which I can manage my contact group itself.
So, what I mean is, like, if I look at Twitter

01:09:55.339 --> 01:09:56.339
and I'm getting my followers, I follow a bunch
of people and on here I meet someone, add

01:09:56.339 --> 01:09:57.339
them to my list, same goes for Gmail, for
Yahoo, you know. But, when I try to set privacy

01:09:57.339 --> 01:09:58.339
preferences, you either make me pick every
person in my contact and decide how I want

01:09:58.339 --> 01:09:59.339
to work with them, or I have to come up with
groups, which, of course, change over time.

01:09:59.339 --> 01:10:00.339
So, my question is why not kind of have someone
that actually look at managing your contact

01:10:00.339 --> 01:10:01.339
groups in a way where, as a very simple example,
if it could remember the context in which

01:10:01.339 --> 01:10:02.339
I added or changed a contact, and brings it
up to me when I have to set privacy preferences,

01:10:02.339 --> 01:10:03.339
maybe I can dynamically create groups?

01:10:03.339 --> 01:10:04.339
&gt;&gt;Kara: Great question. Yahoo guy should answer
that.

01:10:04.339 --> 01:10:05.339
&gt;&gt;Neil: Yeah, you know for us it comes again
back to that diversity. We do have a lot of

01:10:05.339 --> 01:10:06.339
different places where you can manage these
things because, you know, the folks you follow

01:10:06.339 --> 01:10:07.339
on Flickr aren't necessarily the folks in
your address book, aren't necessarily the

01:10:07.339 --> 01:10:08.339
people you email frequently. But, I think
there's a tension there not only with that,

01:10:08.339 --> 01:10:09.339
but with the way people use things. You know,
you could, for example, be a Facebook user

01:10:09.339 --> 01:10:10.339
that's a family broadcaster. You have 20 people;
maybe managing the whole list all at once

01:10:10.339 --> 01:10:11.339
is totally appropriate. On the other hand,
you probably have more than 20 friends and,

01:10:11.339 --> 01:10:12.339
and they're probably different levels of,
you know, of closeness and so, it is times,

01:10:12.339 --> 01:10:13.339
at times challenging to build a product that
satisfies both types. To satisfy a commercial

01:10:13.339 --> 01:10:14.339
entity on Twitter, like a brand or a product
that's being followed has different needs

01:10:14.339 --> 01:10:15.339
and capabilities, you know, for management
than a, than an individual, right? So, it

01:10:15.339 --> 01:10:16.339
is a challenge, I don't think there's any
single solution. If there were I think somebody

01:10:16.339 --> 01:10:17.339
in the industry would've stumbled on it already.

01:10:17.339 --> 01:10:18.339
&gt;&gt;Kara: Quick questions, everybody, cause
I wanna get everyone's questions.

01:10:18.339 --> 01:10:19.339
&gt;&gt;male audience member #3: Quick question
for, this is for Twitter. You guys announced

01:10:19.339 --> 01:10:20.339
your Library of Congress Preservation Deal
last month and I think for the first question,

01:10:20.339 --> 01:10:21.339
I was asked about retention of that data,
and I think that is going to be a hot button

01:10:21.339 --> 01:10:22.339
issue, particularly for younger people; younger
generation they see a lot of stuff that, I

01:10:22.339 --> 01:10:23.339
mean, watch trendy topics and imagine that
being in, being archived in perpetuity. So

01:10:23.339 --> 01:10:24.339
I was wondering if I could maybe get you to
address maybe for on the user case, that you

01:10:24.339 --> 01:10:25.339
could allow the people to opt out of that,
so it's not the default. Because the only

01:10:25.339 --> 01:10:26.339
way to not be in the Library of Congress is
to kill it in the 23rd week, which is what

01:10:26.339 --> 01:10:27.339
hackers like me. I hacked together a, you
know, an app just to do that so that, that

01:10:27.339 --> 01:10:28.339
won't happen, you know what I mean? Because
I, I think the intention is the real time

01:10:28.339 --> 01:10:29.339
communication, it's not necessarily, it gets
stale, and after that it has very little value

01:10:29.339 --> 01:10:30.339
for the author. It has value for everybody
else, but not the author. So, I was wondering

01:10:30.339 --> 01:10:31.339
if you have given any thought to allowing
users to opt out of that Firehose feed to,

01:10:31.339 --> 01:10:32.339
to The Library of Congress.

01:10:32.339 --> 01:10:33.339
&gt;&gt;Kara: He doesn't want all his little updates
shown, right--

01:10:33.339 --> 01:10:34.339
&gt;&gt; male audience member #3: Or, or kids, for
that matter.

01:10:34.339 --> 01:10:35.339
&gt;&gt;Kara: Or kids, sure.

01:10:35.339 --> 01:10:36.339
&gt;&gt;Ryan: I can't speak for the whole company
because I don't know the exact details of

01:10:36.339 --> 01:10:37.339
it. In general, obviously we have delete features
and you can't selectively opt out of specific

01:10:37.339 --> 01:10:38.339
syndication deals, but I know that there are
ways to delete that data out. We, you know,

01:10:38.339 --> 01:10:39.339
all of our syndication deals when we send
a delete through the system; they have to

01:10:39.339 --> 01:10:40.339
respect those deletes also. So, I don't know
if there's a single button you can go click

01:10:40.339 --> 01:10:41.339
to opt out of that one specifically, but it's
something to look into.

01:10:41.339 --> 01:10:42.339
&gt;&gt; male audience member #3: No, there's not.
It should be, but the deal was there's a six

01:10:42.339 --> 01:10:43.339
month embargo or a period in which you can,
you can delete it, right?

01:10:43.339 --> 01:10:44.339
&gt;&gt;Kara: But then after that--

01:10:44.339 --> 01:10:45.339
&gt;&gt; male audience member #3: But people won't,
so again,

01:10:45.339 --> 01:10:46.339
&gt;&gt;Kara: Yeah.

01:10:46.339 --> 01:10:47.339
&gt;&gt; male audience member #3: programs have
come up with ways around it, but anyway. Reten--,

01:10:47.339 --> 01:10:48.339
retention, I think is gonna be a huge issue.

01:10:48.339 --> 01:10:49.339
&gt;&gt;Kara: I'm gonna go on to the next question,
that's an excellent point. Two hundred years

01:10:49.339 --> 01:10:50.339
from now, someone's gonna be researching in
the Library of Congress reading all those

01:10:50.339 --> 01:10:51.339
Twitter feeds and is gonna wanna know, "What
the hell was wrong with our society?"

01:10:51.339 --> 01:10:52.339
[laughter]

01:10:52.339 --> 01:10:53.339
&gt;&gt; male audience member #4: I don't know where
the social Web is going, but I know that it's

01:10:53.339 --> 01:10:54.339
getting a lot more complicated very quickly
and you guys keep adding features and changing

01:10:54.339 --> 01:10:55.339
things and, and people are getting more and
more dazed and confused. So, --

01:10:55.339 --> 01:10:56.339
&gt;&gt;Kara: Yeah. That's cause they all have ADHD
at 40 FYI, just so you know.

01:10:56.339 --> 01:10:57.339
&gt;&gt; male audience member #4: So, so, are you
guys gonna keep doing that? Or, do you think

01:10:57.339 --> 01:10:58.339
there will be a backlash and, and you guys
will be forced to make things more transparent

01:10:58.339 --> 01:10:59.339
and simpler and easier to use?

01:10:59.339 --> 01:11:00.339
&gt;&gt;Chris Cole: Well, it's just the nature of
software that the first thing you look at

01:11:00.339 --> 01:11:01.339
is adding features. Reducing complexity is
a much harder problem than adding a new feature.

01:11:01.339 --> 01:11:02.339
Over time I would see, that, and you do see
some shift in the public spec groups about

01:11:02.339 --> 01:11:03.339
just adding richer metadata around it, even
this Open Graph Protocol is very interesting

01:11:03.339 --> 01:11:04.339
because it simplifies the problem of when
someone shares content on a site; it makes

01:11:04.339 --> 01:11:05.339
it much easier to scrape the content. So,
as far as adding--

01:11:05.339 --> 01:11:06.339
&gt;&gt;Kara: No, no. It's gonna be more complex.
I'm gonna answer--

01:11:06.339 --> 01:11:07.339
&gt;&gt;Chris Cole: I don't think they're--

01:11:07.339 --> 01:11:08.339
&gt;&gt;Kara: Microsoft guy, they love features
at Microsoft.

01:11:08.339 --> 01:11:09.339
&gt;&gt;Angus: Yeah, I don't know how you can like,
why would you measure yourself on the number

01:11:09.339 --> 01:11:10.339
of features you build and ship. Like, that's,
like, it's about the killer experience that

01:11:10.339 --> 01:11:11.339
you're giving consumers and so, like, I'm
not about pushing code every night but creating

01:11:11.339 --> 01:11:12.339
something that's coherent across, like, the,
the phone or the PC or the inbox or the IM,

01:11:12.339 --> 01:11:13.339
like, I, I mean, feature count is dumb. Like,
listen to--

01:11:13.339 --> 01:11:14.339
&gt;&gt;Kara: And yet you all keep coming out with
more features then, then, you can imagine.

01:11:14.339 --> 01:11:15.339
It is true, it's completely confusing, I agree
with you. You're absolutely right. Quick,

01:11:15.339 --> 01:11:16.339
very quickly, I would like to get to everybody.

01:11:16.339 --> 01:11:17.339
&gt;&gt; male audience member #5: So, Google TV
came out today and it brings up the new social

01:11:17.339 --> 01:11:18.339
context of the, the living room. And I know,
is, is there some way to make an Android for

01:11:18.339 --> 01:11:19.339
more than one person in the family to be logged
in? Are we no longer going to be fighting

01:11:19.339 --> 01:11:20.339
over the remote, over the login? And is, and
is anybody else dealing with the collective

01:11:20.339 --> 01:11:21.339
identity piece that goes into social behavior?

01:11:21.339 --> 01:11:22.339
&gt;&gt;Chris: I'll try to address that quickly
so we can get all the other questions. But,

01:11:22.339 --> 01:11:23.339
what I saw today was that there could be multiple
Android devices that are tethered to the same

01:11:23.339 --> 01:11:24.339
TV. Now, from an identity perspective, that
confuses the hell out of me. But I think it's

01:11:24.339 --> 01:11:25.339
awesome. So, there's this whole weird context
and confluence of identities being used simultaneously

01:11:25.339 --> 01:11:26.339
on a computing device that we've not seen
before, which raises a whole host of questions

01:11:26.339 --> 01:11:27.339
which don't clear up answers. So, I think
its gonna be very interesting to see what

01:11:27.339 --> 01:11:28.339
happens when there are two Android devices
tethered to a machine and then it has to figure

01:11:28.339 --> 01:11:29.339
out what kind of recommendations to provide
to one or two or both of those people. So,

01:11:29.339 --> 01:11:30.339
I don't have a great answer, I think--

01:11:30.339 --> 01:11:31.339
&gt;&gt;Kara: I think it's the same old story; fighting
over the remote.

01:11:31.339 --> 01:11:32.339
&gt;&gt;Chris: Actually, it's a good social experience.

01:11:32.339 --> 01:11:33.339
&gt;&gt;Kara: Now, I wanna watch The Notebook, I
wanna watch Terminator.

01:11:33.339 --> 01:11:34.339
&gt;&gt;Chris: So, it's complicated.

01:11:34.339 --> 01:11:35.339
&gt;&gt;Kara: Yeah. But that's true, it's what they're
gonna--I've seen some people carry, you know,

01:11:35.339 --> 01:11:36.339
it's the one person in the room right now
that gets precedence over others.

01:11:36.339 --> 01:11:37.339
&gt;&gt;Chris: But, but so the Android, the, the
TV shown today allows for both to control.

01:11:37.339 --> 01:11:38.339
&gt;&gt;Kara: Yeah, utterly confusing.

01:11:38.339 --> 01:11:39.339
&gt;&gt;Chris: Utterly.

01:11:39.339 --> 01:11:40.339
&gt;&gt;Kara: Ok.

01:11:40.339 --> 01:11:41.339
&gt;&gt;Chris: Awesome.

01:11:41.339 --> 01:11:42.339
&gt;&gt;Kara: Real quick.

01:11:42.339 --> 01:11:43.339
&gt;&gt; male audience member #6: So, this, this
is, I, I'd like an answer from each of you,

01:11:43.339 --> 01:11:44.339
but it's gonna be really quick--

01:11:44.339 --> 01:11:45.339
&gt;&gt;Kara: No, one.

01:11:45.339 --> 01:11:46.339
&gt;&gt;audience7: What, what open initiative do
you see as being the most important for developers

01:11:46.339 --> 01:11:47.339
to watch over the next six months? For example--

01:11:47.339 --> 01:11:48.339
&gt;&gt;Kara: Ok, one more answer for everyone.

01:11:48.339 --> 01:11:49.339
&gt;&gt;Chris: Activity streams.

01:11:49.339 --> 01:11:50.339
&gt;&gt;Neil: Ditto.

01:11:50.339 --> 01:11:51.339
&gt;&gt;Chris Cole: There's too many to give an
answer.

01:11:51.339 --> 01:11:52.339
&gt;&gt;Adam: Mobile.

01:11:52.339 --> 01:11:53.339
&gt;&gt;Angus: I think the Open Web Foundation legitimized
everything, like, let's do it properly.

01:11:53.339 --> 01:11:54.339
&gt;&gt;Ryan: OAuth identity, probably.

01:11:54.339 --> 01:11:55.339
&gt;&gt;Kara: Yeah, Right here?

01:11:55.339 --> 01:11:56.339
&gt;&gt;female audience member #2: One of the things
I saw in Buzz early on was all sorts of IP

01:11:56.339 --> 01:11:57.339
aggregated things from Twitter, from other
places and I loved that about it and I'm wondering

01:11:57.339 --> 01:11:58.339
if you see more of that sort of aggregator
so people can come in from various silos using

01:11:58.339 --> 01:11:59.339
whatever interface they want and get their
information together?

01:11:59.339 --> 01:12:00.339
&gt;&gt;Angus: Aggregation is not the answer, either.
Its, otherwise, you end up with more, like,

01:12:00.339 --> 01:12:01.339
confusing stuff together. You gotta bring
it together, curate it, and then surface into

01:12:01.339 --> 01:12:02.339
the right area at the right time. Like, aggregation
is not, it's a, it's just a way to get people

01:12:02.339 --> 01:12:03.339
shouting.

01:12:03.339 --> 01:12:04.339
&gt;&gt;Chris: Well, at the same time, I think one
of the things I'm most interested in, in seeing

01:12:04.339 --> 01:12:05.339
how activity streams can actually be used
as a cross industry way of moving this information

01:12:05.339 --> 01:12:06.339
around on the first silo, then on the second
silo allowing for relevancy engines to actually

01:12:06.339 --> 01:12:07.339
custom tailor information so that it's more
relevant, more interesting, based on the things

01:12:07.339 --> 01:12:08.339
you care about. I know, for example, I had
my Twitter feed pulled in to Buzz in the beginning

01:12:08.339 --> 01:12:09.339
and a lot of people hated it because it was
completely non-contextual and it seemed like

01:12:09.339 --> 01:12:10.339
I was, like I had Tourettes or something,
so I had to turn it off. However, over time,

01:12:10.339 --> 01:12:11.339
there might be more interesting social fidelity
that can be derived from more and more richer

01:12:11.339 --> 01:12:12.339
metadata, so I think that the, you know, the
final answer is not there yet, but, but these

01:12:12.339 --> 01:12:13.339
streams allow for more experimentation to
occur.

01:12:13.339 --> 01:12:14.339
&gt;&gt;Kara: Ok, sorry guys, she just told me she
had one more question. This woman here is

01:12:14.339 --> 01:12:15.339
waiting, sorry. You guys can come up afterwards
and ask them.

01:12:15.339 --> 01:12:16.339
&gt;&gt;female audience member #3: What are your
thoughts on projects like Diaspora? Do they

01:12:16.339 --> 01:12:17.339
have a shot in the future against social networks
like Facebook?

01:12:17.339 --> 01:12:18.339
&gt;&gt;Kara: There's no Facebook person here.

01:12:18.339 --> 01:12:19.339
&gt;&gt;Chris: So, Diaspora is a distributed, open,
privacy-centric, something, keyword, buzzword,

01:12:19.339 --> 01:12:20.339
aware social network, that raised a hundred
and seventy bazillion dollars on Kickstarter--

01:12:20.339 --> 01:12:21.339
&gt;&gt;audience9: And other projects like that,
too.

01:12:21.339 --> 01:12:22.339
&gt;&gt;Chris: And other projects like that, too.
I don't mean to like, you know, disparage

01:12:22.339 --> 01:12:23.339
it at all; I think it's actually very important.
I think it's really important for the ecosystem

01:12:23.339 --> 01:12:24.339
and for a broader community to have conversations
about projects like that. However, I think

01:12:24.339 --> 01:12:25.339
that it's incredibly important for projects
like that to also promote the adoption of

01:12:25.339 --> 01:12:26.339
technologies that already exist, that have
been developed over the last several years,

01:12:26.339 --> 01:12:27.339
to solve those problems specifically because
if we just end up with more fragmentation

01:12:27.339 --> 01:12:28.339
or more geeks running the stuff on their own
hardware, we're not actually solving the problem

01:12:28.339 --> 01:12:29.339
for the broader audience. So, I really, you
know, wanna see them succeed and I wanna see

01:12:29.339 --> 01:12:30.339
them contribute to the ecosystem--

01:12:30.339 --> 01:12:31.339
&gt;&gt;Kara: Do you-- I kind of look at them as
a little Tea Party.

01:12:31.339 --> 01:12:32.339
&gt;&gt;Chris: The Tea Party Open Source Social
Web, it's great.

01:12:32.339 --> 01:12:33.339
&gt;&gt;Angus: I think there's gonna be more of
these random, little, vertical social networks

01:12:33.339 --> 01:12:34.339
or random horizontal social networks in different
geographies. I mean, Kara, you were trashing

01:12:34.339 --> 01:12:35.339
Orkut for being big in Brazil.

01:12:35.339 --> 01:12:36.339
&gt;&gt;Kara: I didn't trash Orkut, I'm just saying
they're big in Brazil.

01:12:36.339 --> 01:12:37.339
&gt;&gt;Angus: You said it's--

01:12:37.339 --> 01:12:38.339
&gt;&gt;Kara: It's not as big a deal as being big
in the United States, Europe, and the rest

01:12:38.339 --> 01:12:39.339
of the world, but that's just me.

01:12:39.339 --> 01:12:40.339
&gt;&gt;Angus: Even on the surface, it looks like
there's aggregation, I'm sure everyone may

01:12:40.339 --> 01:12:41.339
have a account with a social network. There's
gonna be more and more of these distributed

01:12:41.339 --> 01:12:42.339
networks, more fragmentation for more niche
things and we just need to bring it together.

01:12:42.339 --> 01:12:43.339
&gt;&gt;Kara: You're right. I like little Orkut.
He's adorable, he' a sweetheart.

01:12:43.339 --> 01:12:44.339
&gt;&gt;Angus: I like Gowalla well, I didn't mean
to trash it--

01:12:44.339 --> 01:12:45.339
&gt;&gt;Kara: That's fine. Say Gowalla again cause
it sounds better in Australian. It does. So,

01:12:45.339 --> 01:12:46.339
anyway, you're last thing? Did you want to?

01:12:46.339 --> 01:12:47.339
&gt;&gt;Ryan: No.

01:12:47.339 --> 01:12:48.339
&gt;&gt;Kara: No, ok, great guys. Come by, come
and ask them any questions you want. They'll

01:12:48.339 --> 01:12:49.339
hang around here for a minute and then thank
you very much and please give a round of applause,

01:12:49.339 --> 01:12:49.344
they did a great job.
