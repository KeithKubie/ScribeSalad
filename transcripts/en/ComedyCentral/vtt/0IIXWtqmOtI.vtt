HERE TO HELP US UNDERSTAND
THE COMPLEXITIES OF THIS ISSUES

00:00:04.003 --> 00:00:09.042 align:start position:0% line:91%
ARE NEW NIGHTLY SHOW SPECIAL
COMMENTATOR SUSIE ESSMAN.

00:00:09.075 --> 00:00:09.976 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; WELCOME, SUZE.

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:16.015 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; THANKS, LARRY.

00:00:16.048 --> 00:00:16.482 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry:.

00:00:16.515 --> 00:00:17.650 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; THANKS, LARRY.

00:00:17.683 --> 00:00:21.621 line:91%
I HAVE GOT ONE MAJOR PROBLEM
WITH THIS NEW LIBIDO DRUG.

00:00:21.654 --> 00:00:25.591 align:start position:0% line:91%
WHY WOULD A WOMAN OF MY AGE IN
GOD'S NAME WOULD I WANT MY

00:00:25.624 --> 00:00:29.929 line:91%
LIBIDO BACK?  EVERY DUMB THING I
EVER DID IN MY YOUTH WAS BECAUSE

00:00:29.962 --> 00:00:33.366 line:91%
I WAS LISTENING TO THE DERANGED
LITTLE VOICE IN MY HEAD TELLING

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:34.901 size:75% position:38% line:85%
ME I NEEDED TO GET LAID.

00:00:34.934 --> 00:00:38.871 align:start position:0% line:91%
EVERY HANGOVER, EVERY FAKE
ORGASM, EVERY TIME I BROKE INTO

00:00:38.904 --> 00:00:43.843 align:start position:0% line:91%
BILL PULLMAN'S HOUSE SO I COULD
HIDE IN HIS CLOSET WHILE HE

00:00:43.876 --> 00:00:46.345 align:start position:0% line:91%
SLEPT --
&gt;&gt; AND THIS WAS THE NINETIES, SO

00:00:46.378 --> 00:00:50.216 line:91%
JUST TO BE CLEAR, ONE THING I
DON'T NEED IS MY COOTER DOING

00:00:50.249 --> 00:00:56.522 align:start position:0% line:91%
JEDI MIND TRICKS ON ME LIKE
OBI-VAJ KENOBI.

00:00:56.555 --> 00:01:02.995 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: UHM, YOU JUST SAID
OBI-VAJ KENOBI, RIGHT?

00:01:03.028 --> 00:01:03.463 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; YES, I DID.

00:01:03.496 --> 00:01:04.063 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: OKAY.

00:01:04.097 --> 00:01:05.264 size:81% position:41% line:85%
I JUST WANTED TO BE CLEAR.

00:01:05.297 --> 00:01:06.499 size:81% position:41% line:85%
I JUST WANTED TO BE CHEER.

00:01:06.532 --> 00:01:09.669 align:start position:0% line:91%
NOW THERE ARE WOMEN WHO HAVE LOW
LIBIDO AND MISS HAVING SEX.

00:01:09.702 --> 00:01:12.338 size:84% position:42% line:85%
THAT IS DEFINITELY A THING.

00:01:12.371 --> 00:01:13.506 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; MAYBE.

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:15.208 align:start position:0% line:91%
CHECK OUT THIS QUOTE FROM A
WOMAN IN "THE NEW YORK TIMES",

00:01:15.241 --> 00:01:18.044 align:start position:0% line:85%
NO LESS.

00:01:18.077 --> 00:01:21.280 line:91%
REPLACING THE DREAD I HAVE FOR
INTIMACY WITH DESIRE WOULD BE

00:01:21.313 --> 00:01:21.780 align:start position:0% line:85%
LIFE CHANGING.

00:01:21.814 --> 00:01:23.182 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; I WOULD THINK SO.

00:01:23.215 --> 00:01:26.953 line:91%
ALL I AM SAYING IS IF YOU ARE
LITERALLY DREADING INTIMACY

00:01:26.986 --> 00:01:28.621 align:start position:0% line:91%
MAYBE THERE IS SOMETHING ELSE
GOING ON.

00:01:28.654 --> 00:01:31.757 align:start position:0% line:91%
THE THING THAT GETS ME IS THIS
ASSUMPTION JUST BECAUSE YOU

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:34.627 align:start position:0% line:91%
DON'T WANT TO HAVE SEX YOU HAVE
A MENTAL DISORDER.

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:37.163 align:start position:0% line:91%
HEY, FELLOWS, MAYBE YOUR WIFE IS
NOT CRAZY.

00:01:37.196 --> 00:01:44.837 align:start position:0% line:91%
MAYBE SHE JUST DOESN'T WANT TO
(BLEEP) YOU.

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:45.471 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: GOOD POINT.

00:01:45.504 --> 00:01:46.506 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; I AM JUST SAYING.

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:47.640 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: GOOD POINT.

00:01:47.674 --> 00:01:51.344 line:91%
&gt;&gt; HAVE YOU TRIED HITTING THE
GYM?  BUYING HER FLOWERS? 

00:01:51.377 --> 00:01:54.914 align:start position:0% line:91%
HAVING SEX THAT IS NOT JUST 45
SECONDS OF JACKHAMMERING

00:01:54.947 --> 00:02:01.687 align:start size:97% position:3% line:91%
FOLLOWED BY A SWEATY APOLOGY? 
THE FDA REJECTED THIS THING

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.356 align:start position:0% line:91%
TWICE BEFORE AND THEY MIGHT HAVE
BEEN RIGHT.

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:04.624 line:85%
LISTEN TO THESE SIDE EFFECTS.

00:02:04.657 --> 00:02:08.261 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THIS IS A DRUG YOU TAKE EVERY
DAY AND THEN GO OUT AND HAVE

00:02:08.294 --> 00:02:09.529 align:start position:0% line:85%
YOUR DAILY ROUTINE.

00:02:09.562 --> 00:02:12.431 line:91%
SO IF YOU PASS OUT WHILE DRIVING
A CAR, IF YOU PASS OUT WHILE YOU

00:02:12.464 --> 00:02:15.334 line:91%
ARE TAKING YOUR KIDS TO SCHOOL
AND HIT YOUR HEAD I MEAN THIS

00:02:15.367 --> 00:02:16.469 line:85%
CAN BE SERIOUS AND UNEXPECTED.

00:02:16.502 --> 00:02:21.541 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; A SEX PILL THAT MIGHT MAKE
YOU PASS OUT?

00:02:21.574 --> 00:02:31.417 size:88% position:44% line:91%
&gt;&gt; WHICH DOCTOR IS ENDORSING
THIS BESIDES DR. HUXTABLE?

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:32.652 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: WOW.

00:02:32.685 --> 00:02:33.653 align:start position:0% line:85%
SOLID COSBY BURN.

00:02:33.686 --> 00:02:34.887 align:start position:0% line:85%
THAT'S RIGHT, (BLEEP).

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.723 align:start position:0% line:91%
EVEN OUR COMMENTARIES HAVEN'T
FORGOTTEN ABOUT YOU.

00:02:37.756 --> 00:02:41.027 size:81% position:41% line:91%
&gt;&gt; YOU BETCHA AND FINALLY
I JUST WANT TO SAY, I KNOW

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.597 line:91%
PEOPLE THINK THIS IS A FEMINIST
ISSUE, LIKE YOU SAID, LARRY, SEX

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:46.299 line:91%
PILLS HAVE BEEN OUT THERE FOR
MEN. MEN HAVE 26 AND WOMEN

00:02:46.332 --> 00:02:50.603 align:start size:94% position:6% line:91%
HAVE ZERO WHICH IS ALSO MOST
COUPLE'S ORGASM RATIO.

00:02:50.636 --> 00:02:54.207 line:91%
ONE OF THE GROUPS FIGHTING FOR
APPROVAL, FDA APPROVAL OF THIS

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.275 align:start position:0% line:91%
WONDER DRUG IS CALLED EVEN THE
SCORE.

00:02:56.308 --> 00:02:57.509 align:start position:0% line:85%
ALL RIGHT.

00:02:57.543 --> 00:03:01.981 line:91%
THEY HAVE DONE A GREAT JOB OF
FRAMING THIS IN TERMS OF ORGASM

00:03:02.014 --> 00:03:03.149 align:start position:0% line:85%
EQUALITY.

00:03:03.182 --> 00:03:06.319 align:start position:0% line:91%
BUT BECAUSE I HAD FREE TIME ON
MY HANDS BECAUSE OF ALL THE

00:03:06.352 --> 00:03:09.689 align:start position:0% line:91%
NON-BANGING I DO I FOUND OUT
THAT EVEN THE SCORE IS JUST A PR

00:03:09.722 --> 00:03:13.192 align:start position:0% line:91%
CAMPAIGN FUNDED BY THE DRUG
COMPANY THAT MAKES THIS PILL! 

00:03:13.225 --> 00:03:17.296 line:91%
IT IS LIKE IF YOUR METH DEALER
TRIES TO TELL YOU YOU NEEDED TO

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:20.433 align:start position:0% line:91%
BUY HIS METH BECAUSE YOU
SUFFERED FROM HAVING TOO MANY

00:03:20.466 --> 00:03:21.134 align:start position:0% line:85%
TEETH.

00:03:21.167 --> 00:03:23.469 line:85%
&gt;&gt; THE WHOLE THING IS JUST SPIN.

00:03:23.502 --> 00:03:25.938 line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: THAT IS FASCINATING. 
SO IT SOUNDS LIKE THIS WAS ABOUT

00:03:25.971 --> 00:03:28.674 align:start position:0% line:91%
WIN FOR SCIENCE OR FEMINISM BUT
JUST FOR BRANDING?

00:03:28.707 --> 00:03:31.410 size:88% position:44% line:91%
&gt;&gt; AND FOR WOMEN WHO LOVE TO
FALL ASLEEP WHILE THEY ARE

00:03:31.443 --> 00:03:31.810 align:start position:0% line:85%
DRIVING.

00:03:31.844 --> 00:03:32.277 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: OH.

00:03:32.311 --> 00:03:33.613 align:start position:0% line:85%
THAT MAKES SENSE.

00:03:33.646 --> 00:03:34.881 align:start position:0% line:85%
THAT MAKES SENSE.

00:03:34.914 --> 00:03:38.284 line:91%
&gt;&gt; LOOK, MAYBE THERE IS A GREAT
FEMALE SEX PILL OUT THERE, BUT I

00:03:38.317 --> 00:03:39.685 size:78% position:39% line:85%
DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS IT.

00:03:39.718 --> 00:03:42.622 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND BESIDES, I DON'T WANT A PILL
THAT INCREASES DESIRE.

00:03:42.655 --> 00:03:46.792 align:start position:0% line:91%
I WANT A PILL THAT INCREASES
SATISFACTION.

00:03:46.825 --> 00:03:47.493 size:84% position:42% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: THAT MAKES SENSE.

00:03:47.526 --> 00:03:48.194 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; OKAY?

00:03:48.227 --> 00:03:49.028 size:84% position:42% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: THAT MAKES SENSE.

00:03:49.061 --> 00:03:52.198 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; I MEAN, HELLO.

00:03:52.231 --> 00:03:53.399 size:84% position:42% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: THAT MAKES SENSE.

00:03:53.432 --> 00:03:56.902 line:91%
&gt;&gt; FOR ONCE I COULD BE THE ONE
ORGASMING AFTER 45 SECONDS AND

00:03:56.935 --> 00:04:00.006 align:start position:0% line:91%
FALL ASLEEP AND THEN HE COULD BE
THE ONE POKING ME BECAUSE I

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:02.975 align:start position:0% line:85%
AM SNORING SO LOUD.

00:04:03.008 --> 00:04:05.208 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: SUSIE
ESSMAN, EVERYONE!
