00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:04.990
The Large Hadron Collider is just as exciting
as it sounds—it’s the world’s largest

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:07.620
and most powerful particle accelerator.

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.570
It helps us discover brand new subatomic particles!

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:15.759
One of the most recent newbies is called uhhhhhh...this.

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:21.750
And it’s a...pentaquark, which is a kind
of exotic hadron...which means what, exactly?

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.160
And how does it fit into—or potentially
break—our modern understanding of quantum

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.160
physics?

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.470
To get there, we need to start with the basics:
the good ol’ Standard Model.

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:35.360
It’s the set of mathematical principles
that, over time and with experimental verification,

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.130
has resulted in a widely-accepted physics
theory.

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:43.180
It’s an organized way of looking at the
elementary particles and fundamental forces

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.640
of the universe, much in the same way that
the periodic table has organized chemical

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:48.640
elements.

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:55.460
Fermions are the smallest unit
of matter we currently know of —we cannot

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.010
break them down into anything smaller.

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.340
The fundamental forces are what act on the
universe: the strong force, the weak force,

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.420
the electromagnetic force, and the gravitational
force.

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.430
All of the forces except gravity have a carrier
particle, and these are called bosons.

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:15.360
Within the fermions are another two categories:
quarks and leptons.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.430
Quarks are fast-moving points of energy—and
so far we’ve identified 6 kinds, 3 pairs

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:21.680
of two.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.000
The stable matter in the universe is made
up of the first generation of quarks, the

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.670
up and down quarks.

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.570
And for context—all protons are made up
of one down and two up quarks, and neutrons

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:37.620
are made of two down and one up quark, held
together by the strong force.

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:42.500
In the next generation, we have the charm
quark and strange quark, and the last delightfully

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.090
named pair is the top (or truth) and bottom
(or beauty) quarks.

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:52.090
Then we have the other big chunk within the
fermions—the leptons.

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:56.080
Quarks make up protons and neutrons, while
the leptons are a class of particles that

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.000
includes the electron.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.479
Just like with quarks, we’ve got six particles
here, three pairs of two: the electron and

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:09.099
its pair the electron neutrino, the muon and
the muon neutrino, and the tau and tau neutrino.

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:14.269
The electron, muon, and tau particles all
have mass, while their neutrino counterparts

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:19.500
are like their ghosts, with no charge, almost
no mass, hardly interacting with any other

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:20.560
matter at all!

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.480
WHOO ok we made it through the fermions.Then
we have the bosons—the particles that carry

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.870
the universe’s fundamental forces.

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.290
The gluon carries the strong force, which
is what binds the nucleus of an atom—you

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.689
could say it glues things together.

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:39.849
The friendly and familiar photon is what carries
the electromagnetic force, and the W and Z

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:45.530
bosons carry the weak force—the force responsible
for radioactive decay, among other things.

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:50.690
To finish off our current Standard Model,
which is undeniably incomplete, and I promise

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:53.700
we’re working our way up to that particle
I mentioned at the beginning—we’ve got

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.359
the Higgs Boson.

00:02:55.359 --> 00:02:59.889
This name may ring a few bells as it's been
featured all over the news in recent years.

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:01.189
It’s famous!

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:02.189
But why?

00:03:02.189 --> 00:03:07.599
Well, one important part of the Standard Model
is a hypothetical quantum field that is what

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:09.290
gives the particles their mass.

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:15.029
It’s called the Higgs field, which--because
the field behaves with wave-particle duality--is

00:03:15.029 --> 00:03:18.751
carried by the Higgs boson, much like the
fundamental forces are carried by their bosons.

00:03:18.751 --> 00:03:25.059
The experimental confirmation of the Higgs
Boson by the LHC in 2012 was a Nobel-prize

00:03:25.059 --> 00:03:29.989
winning breakthrough--now that we know this
particle exists and how to find it, we’re

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:35.249
able to learn more about it and how it behaves
WITH other particles, like fermions, helping

00:03:35.249 --> 00:03:40.269
us understand how the Higgs field imparts
mass onto the other particles.

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:43.129
It’s totally fine if your brain is breaking
at this point.

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:47.629
A saying attributed to Richard Feynman, one
of the most renowned theoretical physicists

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:52.999
of the 20th century, is anyone who claims
to understand quantum mechanics does not.

00:03:52.999 --> 00:03:58.080
There’s so much more detail here that we’re
not going into, like color charge and spin

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:02.959
dynamics, that we could talk about for literally
years--so if that’s something you’re interested

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:04.599
in, let us know in the comments below.

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:09.340
But since the discovery of the Higgs boson,
no new fundamental particles have come out

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:10.379
of the work at the LHC.

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:12.650
So what are these new discoveries?

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:17.810
Well the pentaquark just discovered is what’s
called a composite particle--specifically,

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:19.140
an exotic hadron.

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:24.340
Hadrons are the class of subatomic particles
made up of clusters of quarks--the proton,

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:26.110
for example is a hadron.

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:31.360
The Large Hadron Collider is so named because
it smashes together protons or other ions

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.259
that all belong to the hadron family.

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:38.610
Hadrons come in different configurations,
either in quark-antiquark pairs, which are

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:44.320
known as mesons, or groups of three quarks,
known as baryons, all held together by the

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:45.670
strong force.

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:49.770
There are a few rebels however, that don’t
fit into this model, and these are called

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:52.090
exotic hadrons.

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:57.259
Predicted decades ago, they were experimentally
discovered in 2014–and are made up configurations

00:04:57.259 --> 00:05:00.970
of quarks that don’t fit into the conventional
hadron blueprint.

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:06.500
This new pentaquark is one such exotic hadron
and, as its name suggests, is made up of 5

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:07.500
quarks.

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:12.189
While it may not necessarily add another dot
to the Standard Model, studying its formation,

00:05:12.189 --> 00:05:17.650
decay, and how all the quarks within the particle
interact with each other tells us a lot about

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:20.630
the behavior of both hadrons and quarks.

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:25.590
These kinds of unstable, short-lived particles
may not be ones we interact with on a daily

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:30.010
basis, but they are very similar to matter
and energy interactions that exist inside

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:34.220
extreme astrophysical environments, like neutron
stars.

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:38.389
Studying these particles here on earth helps
us better understand those kinds of events.

00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:43.939
The Standard Model is our best way of organizing
our existing understanding of the quantum

00:05:43.939 --> 00:05:44.939
world.

00:05:44.939 --> 00:05:48.720
In using the best facilities in the world,
like the LHC, we push the boundaries of how

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:54.220
much of this behavior we can actually see,
in our attempts to experimentally verify the

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:55.220
Standard Model.

00:05:55.220 --> 00:06:00.259
You may notice, however, that gravity, the
fourth fundamental force, is conspicuously

00:06:00.259 --> 00:06:03.780
absent from the Standard Model as a force-carrying
particle.

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:08.810
The current Standard Model of quantum physics
and the theory of general relativity are fundamentally

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:15.449
at odds with one another—if one is correct,
our understanding of the other shifts.

00:06:15.449 --> 00:06:19.729
Like we’re trying to fill out the structure
of the Standard Model with experimental data,

00:06:19.729 --> 00:06:24.220
new astrophysics research aims to support
Einstein’s theory of general relativity,

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:29.039
which could make us rethink physics as a whole,
including the quantum stuff.

00:06:29.039 --> 00:06:32.931
Besides the excitement of actually finding
the particles we’ve been looking for, for

00:06:32.931 --> 00:06:38.230
decades because their existence is predicted
by the Standard Model, new experimental evidence

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:44.110
of particles like this tells us more about
how all the particles in the standard model

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:49.311
interact with each other, why they have the
properties they have, and could clue us in

00:06:49.311 --> 00:06:52.539
on how to look for the stuff we’re still
missing.

00:06:52.539 --> 00:06:55.020
All just by smashing stuff together.
