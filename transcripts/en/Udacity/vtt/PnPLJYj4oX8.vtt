00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:07.170
And now we have seen RAID 0, 1, 2, there
is a 3 but we didn't see it, 4, and 5.

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.560
Is there such a thing as RAID 6?

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:11.160
Yes, there is.

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.930
It's similar to RAID 5 except
that each group of blocks,

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:19.030
instead of getting one parity block,
gets two.

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:21.560
Let's call them parity quoted blocks.

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.090
They have different types of parity.

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:30.040
And as a results, RAID 6 can work when
there are two failed stripes per group.

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:33.630
Note that we cannot do this
with two parity blocks.

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.240
One of the blocks that we keep extra,
one of the known data blocks is going

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:42.150
to be the real parity block, and
that's what fixes one error.

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:47.650
The second of the two blocks is
a different type of check-blocks, and

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:52.650
when only one disk has failed,
we use the parity to recover.

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:57.960
But when two disks have failed,
we can still solve some equations,

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.740
where the data and
the two types of check-blocks figure, so

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:05.940
that we can still recover
the content of the two failed disks.

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:07.860
So let's compare RAID 5 and RAID 6.

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.350
RAID 6 has twice the overhead of RAID 5,

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:16.880
so we pay twice as much for
this increased reliability.

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.630
There is more write overhead because
really now when we update a data block

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.850
we need to read and write the data
block and both of the check-blocks,

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.960
the parity and the second one
are also read and written.

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.233
So there are now six accesses per write

00:01:33.233 --> 00:01:37.230
versus four per write
that we had with RAID 5.

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:39.170
So the only reason for having RAID 6,

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.150
if there is a good chance
of when a disk fails,

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:48.610
another one failing before we manage
to replace the failed first drive.

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:53.390
So note that in any of the RAID
configurations, once your disk fails,

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.040
you don't keep going and
ignore the failed drive.

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.550
You keep going, but
you order a replacement or

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:05.180
get a replacement and install it so that
the RAID array can re-establish itself.

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.420
After that, you can lose another disk.

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.599
So really RAID 6,
with its ability to lose two disks,

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:16.790
only helps if when a disk fails,
there is a good

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.810
chance of another failing before
the first one is replaced.

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.420
The faster we replace the first drive,

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:28.290
the less chance there is that another
disk fails during that period of time.

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.790
Remember that the probability of a disk
failing during an hour is extremely low,

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.570
so even if we spent something like three
days replacing a disk, the probability

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:42.970
of a disk failing in that specific time,
while we are vulnerable,

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.070
is very, very low, and then it
seems that RAID 6 is an overkill.
