&gt;&gt;Student: [Speaking Japanese].

00:00:17.316 --> 00:00:20.026
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The sights and sounds
of Japan are part of the fabric

00:00:20.026 --> 00:00:24.486
of Portland, Oregon, a city with
a world class Japanese garden,

00:00:24.486 --> 00:00:30.706
and a unique public
school language program.

00:00:31.046 --> 00:00:33.336
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Here, Students
are immersed in Japanese

00:00:33.506 --> 00:00:36.976
from their first day of kindergarten.

00:00:36.976 --> 00:00:41.046
&gt;&gt;Students: [Greeting in Japanese]

00:00:41.046 --> 00:00:43.206
&gt;&gt;Deanne: The whole idea of
an immersion education is

00:00:43.206 --> 00:00:44.856
that you are surrounded
in the language.

00:00:44.856 --> 00:00:48.146
You are not teaching
the language independent

00:00:48.446 --> 00:00:55.826
from actual content or
real life situation.

00:00:57.326 --> 00:00:58.606
&gt;&gt;Deanne: I think a lot of people

00:00:58.606 --> 00:01:02.156
in our country have had high school
language and it's a textbook,

00:01:02.156 --> 00:01:05.466
a reading and writing kind of
thing, but immersion means you're

00:01:05.466 --> 00:01:09.366
in a situation where you have to pay
attention to the language in order

00:01:09.366 --> 00:01:11.856
to be able to do the
activity that's going on.

[ Singing in Japanese ]

00:01:18.136 --> 00:01:20.586
&gt;&gt;Deanne: Just through routine
and copying the teacher,

00:01:20.586 --> 00:01:23.846
they start developing a song
vocabulary and other things

00:01:23.846 --> 00:01:26.976
like that, that are part of
their real kindergarten world.

00:01:34.056 --> 00:01:36.066
&gt;&gt;Amy: First day it's,
what's going on?

00:01:36.066 --> 00:01:42.366
And then after that, it's well,
this is the way school is.

00:01:42.616 --> 00:01:49.976
The teacher speaks in a new
language, and I try to figure it out.

[ Singing in Japanese ]

00:01:59.046 --> 00:02:02.686
&gt;&gt;Amy: They are able to use language
in all the things they do in school,

00:02:02.686 --> 00:02:06.626
and when they're washing their
hands, when they're drawing on paper,

00:02:06.626 --> 00:02:08.286
when they're trying to work
out a problem with a friend,

00:02:08.526 --> 00:02:12.486
any of these situations
can be situations

00:02:12.486 --> 00:02:14.976
in which we can insert
language and practice language.

how special it is.

&gt;&gt;Narrator: Enrichment Elementary
School's Japanese Magnet Program,

00:02:23.236 --> 00:02:25.886
students follow the
Oregon State Curriculum.

00:02:26.166 --> 00:02:30.046
They study their core subjects
in Japanese for half the day,

00:02:30.046 --> 00:02:30.966
and English for the other half.

00:02:31.516 --> 00:02:34.546
&gt;&gt;All: [Speaking Japanese].

00:02:35.046 --> 00:02:37.376
&gt;&gt;Narrator: In middle school,
they use Japanese for a third

00:02:37.376 --> 00:02:40.416
of their day, and in high
school, Japanese is offered

00:02:40.416 --> 00:02:41.936
as an advanced language class.

00:02:48.046 --> 00:02:50.516
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Michael Bacon, who has
been teaching in the program for more

00:02:50.516 --> 00:02:53.966
than a decade, sees students
benefiting in many ways.

00:02:54.356 --> 00:02:58.746
&gt;&gt;Michael: Their performance in, sort
of cognitive assessments are higher,

00:02:59.336 --> 00:03:01.866
their ability to see from
multiple perspectives.

00:03:02.056 --> 00:03:06.966
&gt;&gt;Michael: Their academic performance
is higher on standardized testing,

00:03:07.706 --> 00:03:13.256
their ability to pick up a third
and a fourth language is higher.

00:03:13.456 --> 00:03:15.376
That seems to play out
in all the research.

00:03:16.516 --> 00:03:19.546
&gt;&gt;All: [Shouting].

00:03:20.046 --> 00:03:21.236
&gt;&gt;Narrator: At Richmond
Elementary, students can take

00:03:21.236 --> 00:03:24.816
after school classes in martial
arts like karate, and kendo.

00:03:27.076 --> 00:03:30.586
They can also practice calligraphy,
which gives them another way

00:03:30.586 --> 00:03:32.776
to learn the language
and helps children

00:03:32.806 --> 00:03:33.906
with different learning styles.

00:03:34.516 --> 00:03:37.546
&gt;&gt;Teacher: [Speaking Japanese].

00:03:38.046 --> 00:03:39.756
&gt;&gt;Denise: English is very
difficult for her to write.

00:03:39.966 --> 00:03:42.946
The fact of the matter
is, Kanji, and Hiragana

00:03:43.106 --> 00:03:45.646
and Katakana are not
difficult for her to write.

00:03:46.176 --> 00:03:51.386
And I'm not even sure why this is,
except that having those two ways

00:03:51.496 --> 00:03:55.126
to come at one subject,
has been a big help to her.

00:03:56.066 --> 00:04:00.956
So learning to write a new
language was very, very beneficial

00:04:00.956 --> 00:04:03.136
in what it will do for
your brain structure.

00:04:03.576 --> 00:04:08.976
It's a very fascinating thing to see
how easily children can pick that up.

00:04:09.636 --> 00:04:12.796
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Computers can also
help students write in Japanese.

00:04:13.256 --> 00:04:15.766
These fourth graders use
a program that lets them

00:04:15.766 --> 00:04:19.936
from Japanese characters by typing
combinations of English letters.

00:04:20.516 --> 00:04:24.566

multimedia self portraits to share

00:04:27.746 --> 00:04:29.706
with e-mail pen pals in Japan.

00:04:29.706 --> 00:04:33.106
&gt;&gt;Atsuko: Some kids are having
a difficulty actually write

00:04:33.476 --> 00:04:34.446
in Japanese.

00:04:34.446 --> 00:04:36.076
It's because it's complicated
language.

00:04:36.496 --> 00:04:40.316
But since the computers,
they're used to it at home, too,

00:04:40.316 --> 00:04:43.216
they're playing the games, and
they love it, and that boost

00:04:43.216 --> 00:04:47.716
up their interest, so then this
really helps developing their

00:04:47.716 --> 00:04:49.106
literacy skills.

00:04:49.136 --> 00:04:51.746
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Did anybody
carve a pumpkin?

00:04:51.746 --> 00:04:51.966
&gt;&gt;All: Yes.

&gt;&gt;Narrator: In fifth grade
cultural exchange, Japanese students

00:04:55.346 --> 00:04:57.966

&gt;&gt;Teacher: What is the best
thing about your home state?

00:05:06.086 --> 00:05:08.846
&gt;&gt;Japanese Student: If you plant
a seed, it will grow into a tree,

00:05:09.156 --> 00:05:12.316
and you will get more
persimmon than you can ever eat.

00:05:13.216 --> 00:05:15.816
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The visiting students
make presentations in English

00:05:15.816 --> 00:05:23.976
at the school, and stay with
families of fifth graders.

00:05:24.136 --> 00:05:26.816
&gt;&gt;Aimee: I'm incredibly happy that I
started my children in this program.

00:05:27.116 --> 00:05:28.776
My middle child, Mason,
who's in fifth grade,

00:05:28.776 --> 00:05:30.296
who we have the home
stay student for.

00:05:30.616 --> 00:05:32.166
He's shy, he doesn't talk much.

00:05:32.166 --> 00:05:34.416
I wasn't actually sure
how much Japanese he knew.

00:05:34.756 --> 00:05:37.976
When Uta came, I realized
he knew a lot of Japanese.

00:05:41.136 --> 00:05:43.706
&gt;&gt;Aimee: He is speaking
to him in Japanese,

00:05:43.706 --> 00:05:45.936
they've forged a friendship
in just eight days.

00:05:46.296 --> 00:05:48.706
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Later in the year,
Portland fifth graders get

00:05:48.706 --> 00:05:52.486
to visit Japan, and there's another
trip abroad in the eighth grade.

00:05:53.256 --> 00:05:57.186
Money for the trips and other program
needs, is raised by an active group

00:05:57.186 --> 00:05:58.976
of parents, who say the benefits

00:05:58.976 --> 00:06:00.676
of the program are
well worth the effort.

00:06:01.516 --> 00:06:03.546
&gt;&gt;Teacher: [Speaking Japanese].

00:06:04.046 --> 00:06:05.946
&gt;&gt;Parent: You don't spend
extra time or effort thinking

00:06:05.946 --> 00:06:08.466
about how you're learning
Japanese, and all of a sudden,

00:06:08.736 --> 00:06:11.536
they know Japanese, and I can't
imagine how wonderful that would be,

00:06:11.536 --> 00:06:14.766
to graduate from school
with this real skill.

00:06:15.266 --> 00:06:17.266
&gt;&gt;Student: [Speaking Japanese].

00:06:17.516 --> 00:06:20.296
&gt;&gt;Denise: I think if you can
take a child at the age of five,

00:06:20.296 --> 00:06:25.006
and throw them into that cultural
and language mix, and let them know

00:06:25.006 --> 00:06:26.676
that English is not
the only language,

00:06:26.676 --> 00:06:32.386
that America is not the only culture,
they develop a really broad tolerance

00:06:32.386 --> 00:06:33.446
of things that are different.

00:06:34.031 --> 00:06:36.031
&gt;&gt;All: [Shouting].

00:06:36.046 --> 00:06:38.536
&gt;&gt;Denise: We live in a small
world, and I really feel that,

00:06:38.626 --> 00:06:43.526
as it becomes increasingly smaller,
we must learn to, not only get along

00:06:43.526 --> 00:06:46.606
with other nations and other
cultures, we need to understand

00:06:46.606 --> 00:06:49.056
and not think that we are
the only kids on the block.
