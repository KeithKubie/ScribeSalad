00:00:07.295 --> 00:00:09.237
This is a tomato plant,

00:00:09.237 --> 00:00:12.546
and this is an aphid slowly killing
the tomato plant

00:00:12.546 --> 00:00:16.093
by sucking the juice out of its leaves.

00:00:16.093 --> 00:00:20.747
The tomato is putting up a fight
using both physical and chemical defenses

00:00:20.747 --> 00:00:24.134
to repel the attacking insects.

00:00:24.134 --> 00:00:25.405
But that's not all.

00:00:25.405 --> 00:00:29.906
The tomato is also releasing compounds
that signal nearby tomato plants

00:00:29.906 --> 00:00:33.637
to release their own insect repellent.

00:00:33.637 --> 00:00:37.106
Plants are constantly under attack.

00:00:37.106 --> 00:00:40.437
They face threats ranging from 
microscopic fungi and bacteria,

00:00:40.437 --> 00:00:44.427
small herbivores, like aphids,
caterpillars, and grasshoppers,

00:00:44.427 --> 00:00:50.048
up to large herbivores, like tortoises,
koalas, and elephants.

00:00:50.048 --> 00:00:54.058
All are looking to devour plants
to access the plentiful nutrients

00:00:54.058 --> 00:00:58.978
and water in their leaves, stems,
fruits, and seeds.

00:00:58.978 --> 00:01:03.852
But plants are ready with a whole
series of internal and external defenses

00:01:03.852 --> 00:01:06.658
that make them a much less 
appealing meal,

00:01:06.658 --> 00:01:10.058
or even a deadly one.

00:01:10.058 --> 00:01:12.569
Plants' defenses start at their surface.

00:01:12.569 --> 00:01:16.730
The bark covering tree trunks is full
of lignin,

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:19.788
a rigid web of compounds that's
tough to chew

00:01:19.788 --> 00:01:23.629
and highly impermeable to pathogens.

00:01:23.629 --> 00:01:25.952
Leaves are protected by
a waxy cuticle

00:01:25.952 --> 00:01:29.270
that deters insects and microbes.

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.389
Some plants go a step further
with painful structures

00:01:33.389 --> 00:01:35.760
to warn would-be predators.

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:39.891
Thorns, spines, and prickles
discourage bigger herbivores.

00:01:39.891 --> 00:01:46.100
To deal with smaller pests, some plants'
leaves have sharp hair-like structures

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.209
called trichomes.

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:53.781
The kidney bean plant sports tiny
hooks to stab the feet of bed bugs

00:01:53.781 --> 00:01:56.762
and other insects.

00:01:56.762 --> 00:02:01.612
In some species, trichomes also dispense
chemical irritants.

00:02:01.612 --> 00:02:05.941
Stinging nettles release a mixture
of histamine and other toxins

00:02:05.941 --> 00:02:10.542
that cause pain and inflammation
when touched.

00:02:10.542 --> 00:02:16.312
For other plant species, the pain comes
after an herbivore's first bite.

00:02:16.322 --> 00:02:16.982
Spinach,

00:02:16.982 --> 00:02:17.941
kiwi fruit,

00:02:17.941 --> 00:02:18.964
pineapple,

00:02:18.964 --> 00:02:19.836
fuchsia

00:02:19.836 --> 00:02:27.353
and rhubarb all produce microscopic
needle-shaped crystals called raphides.

00:02:27.353 --> 00:02:31.443
They can cause tiny wounds in the inside
of animals' mouths,

00:02:31.443 --> 00:02:36.095
which create entry points for toxins.

00:02:36.095 --> 00:02:40.123
The mimosa plant has a strategy
designed to prevent herbivores

00:02:40.123 --> 00:02:42.633
from taking a bite at all.

00:02:42.633 --> 00:02:45.914
Specialized mechanoreceptor cells
detect touch

00:02:45.914 --> 00:02:51.174
and shoot an electrical signal
through the leaflet to its base

00:02:51.174 --> 00:02:55.264
causing cells there to release
charged particles.

00:02:55.264 --> 00:02:58.695
The buildup of charge draws
water out of these cells

00:02:58.695 --> 00:03:02.754
and they shrivel, 
pulling the leaflet closed.

00:03:02.754 --> 00:03:05.735
The folding movement scares insects away

00:03:05.735 --> 00:03:10.086
and the shrunken leaves look less
appealing to larger animals.

00:03:10.086 --> 00:03:12.964
If these external defenses are breached,

00:03:12.964 --> 00:03:16.704
the plant immune system 
springs into action.

00:03:16.704 --> 00:03:19.337
Plants don't have a separate immune system
like animals.

00:03:19.337 --> 00:03:26.267
Instead, every cell has the ability
to detect and defend against invaders.

00:03:26.267 --> 00:03:30.151
Specialized receptors can recognize 
molecules that signal the presence

00:03:30.151 --> 00:03:34.252
of dangerous microbes or insects.

00:03:34.252 --> 00:03:39.604
In response, the immune system initiates 
a battery of defensive maneuvers.

00:03:39.604 --> 00:03:42.383
To prevent more pathogens from making
their way inside,

00:03:42.383 --> 00:03:47.804
the waxy cuticle thickens and cell walls
get stronger.

00:03:47.804 --> 00:03:51.814
Guard cells seal up pores in the leaves.

00:03:51.814 --> 00:03:55.874
And if microbes are devouring one section
of the plant,

00:03:55.874 --> 00:04:01.475
those cells can self-destruct 
to quarantine the infection.

00:04:01.475 --> 00:04:06.135
Compounds toxic to microbes and insects
are also produced,

00:04:06.135 --> 00:04:09.834
often tailor-made for a specific threat.

00:04:09.834 --> 00:04:12.704
Many of the plant molecules that humans
have adopted

00:04:12.704 --> 00:04:15.485
as drugs, medicines and seasonings

00:04:15.485 --> 00:04:20.274
evolved as part of plants' immune systems
because they're antimicrobial,

00:04:20.274 --> 00:04:22.884
or insecticidal.

00:04:22.884 --> 00:04:27.677
An area of a plant under attack can alert
other regions using hormones,

00:04:27.677 --> 00:04:29.186
airborne compounds,

00:04:29.186 --> 00:04:32.096
or even electrical signals.

00:04:32.096 --> 00:04:34.974
When other parts of the plant detect
these signals,

00:04:34.974 --> 00:04:38.687
they ramp up production
of defensive compounds.

00:04:38.687 --> 00:04:40.897
And for some species, like tomatoes,

00:04:40.897 --> 00:04:45.589
this early warning system also
alerts their neighbors.

00:04:45.589 --> 00:04:49.938
Some plants can even recruit
allies to adopt a strong offense

00:04:49.938 --> 00:04:52.877
against their would-be attackers.

00:04:52.877 --> 00:04:55.408
Cotton plants under siege by caterpillars

00:04:55.408 --> 00:05:01.716
release a specific cocktail of ten
to twelve chemicals into the air.

00:05:01.716 --> 00:05:09.218
This mixture attracts parasitic wasps 
that lay eggs inside the caterpillars.

00:05:09.218 --> 00:05:12.489
Plants may not be able to flee the scene
of an attack,

00:05:12.489 --> 00:05:15.299
or fight off predators with teeth
and claws,

00:05:15.299 --> 00:05:16.698
but with sturdy armor,

00:05:16.698 --> 00:05:19.058
a well-stocked chemical arsenal,

00:05:19.058 --> 00:05:20.649
a neighborhood watch,

00:05:20.649 --> 00:05:23.349
and cross-species alliances,

00:05:23.349 --> 00:05:27.116
a plant isn't always an easy meal.
