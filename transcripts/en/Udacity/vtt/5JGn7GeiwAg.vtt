00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:03.710
So, we just learned about what was
probably the most important piece of

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:08.450
math for this class,
in statistics, called Bayes Rule.

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.480
It's invented by Reverend Thomas Bayes,
who was a British mathematician,

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:18.540
and a Presbyterian minister
the eighteenth century.

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:21.544
Bayes Rule is usually stated as follows.

00:00:21.544 --> 00:00:29.000
P of A given B, where B is the evidence
and is variable we care about,

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:35.740
is P of B given A times
P of A over P of B.

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.340
This expression is is
called the likelihood.

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.560
This is called the prior.

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.230
In this is called
the marginal likelihood.

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:49.940
The expression over here
is called the posterior.

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:55.170
The interesting thing is the way
the probabilities are reverted.

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.900
Say we have evidence B.

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:01.540
We know about B but
we really care about the variable A.

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:03.230
So, example B is a test result.

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:05.860
We don't care about
the test result as much we

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:07.721
care about the effect of
whether we have cancer or not.

00:01:07.721 --> 00:01:15.085
This diagnostic reasoning which
is from evidence to its causes,

00:01:15.085 --> 00:01:22.034
is turned upside down by Bayes Rule
into a cause of reasoning.

00:01:22.034 --> 00:01:27.160
Which is given, hypothetically,
we knew the cause,

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.600
what would be the probability of
the evidence which just observed?

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:37.450
But to correct for this inversion,
we have to multiply by the prior

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.750
of the cause to be the case in the first
place, in this case having cancer or

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.270
not, and divide it by
the probability of the evidence.

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:47.400
P of B.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:52.250
Which often is expanded using
the theorem of tolerability as follows:

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:59.670
The probability of B is the sum of all
probabilities of B conditional of A,

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:05.020
lower caps a, times the probability
of A equals lower caps a.

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.095
This is total probability.

00:02:07.095 --> 00:02:07.595
