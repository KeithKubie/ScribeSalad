00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:03.960
In the previous video, splitting
this three-pack of soap

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:06.620
with my wife, she cut it
right down the middle.

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:10.820
So we each got half of all
three bars, or we got 3/2,

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:16.409
or each of us got
3/2 bars of soap.

00:00:16.409 --> 00:00:17.950
Now, just to make
sure that we really

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:20.570
understand what 3/2
is-- and remember,

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:23.140
3/2 is really the same
thing as 3 divided by 2.

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:24.950
If someone says 3
divided by 2, you

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:27.600
could say, hey, I'm going
to represent that as 3/2.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.720
Or someone says 3/2,
you could say, well,

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.565
that's the same thing
as 3 divided by 2.

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:39.589
But just to really
understand this number,

00:00:39.589 --> 00:00:41.630
let's actually think about
where we would plot it

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:43.170
on a number line, as well.

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.170
So let me draw a
number line here.

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.240
I'm going to start that as 0.

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:52.620
Let me draw a line,
as straight a line

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.820
as I am capable of drawing.

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.410
And let's say that this
right over here represents 1.

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:03.490
So that would be 1 bar
of soap in this example.

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:06.770
And let's say that this
right over here is 1/2 bar.

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:08.690
This is 1/2 bar.

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:14.560
And let's say that
this is 1 and 1/2 bars.

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.890
And let's say that this right
over here is 2 bars of soap.

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:20.857
So we have 3/2.

00:01:20.857 --> 00:01:21.940
So let's think about this.

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:25.800
Remember, 3/2 is 3 times 1/2.

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.230
Or, since we already
split this into halves,

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:30.260
we just have to go
3 of these halves.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:31.650
So let's do that.

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.640
So this is 1/2.

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.280
This is 1/2.

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.240
Now we're going to have 2/2.

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.220
That takes us to 1.

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.870
And we know that because
2/2 is equal to 1.

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:44.820
And now let's do our third half.

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.380
Our third half is
right over here.

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.160
And so that is 3/2.

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:54.105
And we see 3/2 is the exact
same thing as 1 and 1/2.

00:01:54.105 --> 00:01:55.480
Now, just to hit
that point home,

00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:00.140
we already saw that 3/2 is the
same thing as 3 divided by 2.

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:05.280
If you were to divide 3 by
2, you would get-- well,

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.750
2 goes into 3 exactly one time.

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.680
And then what would
you have left over?

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.615
Well, you would
have 1/2 left over.

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.834
So 3/2 is the same
thing as 1 and 1/2,

00:02:18.834 --> 00:02:20.250
which is exactly
what we saw here.

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.639
You could view this as we
have 1 and 1/2 bars of soap.

00:02:22.639 --> 00:02:24.930
And this is where you would
plot it on the number line.

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.941
3/2 is halfway in
between 1 and 2.
