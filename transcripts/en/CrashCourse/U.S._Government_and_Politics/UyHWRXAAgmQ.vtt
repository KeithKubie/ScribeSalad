00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.840
Hi I’m Craig and this is Crash Course Government
and Politics, and today we’re going to try

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:11.200
to define one of the trickiest terms in government
and in the Constitution, and that is certiorari.

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.300
No, we've already defined that. Due process
of law. On the most basic level, due process

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:19.349
is what it means to have a fair trial, but, as we’ll see,
it’s a lot more than what goes on in the courtroom.

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.570
Due process can refer to any type of legal
action, but we’re mostly concerned with

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:25.949
criminal procedure here, mainly because it’s
always the government that brings criminal

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.490
charges. Last time, we looked at search warrants
and probable cause, and it’s fair to say

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.430
that this is the beginning of due process,
but search and seizure is the Fourth Amendment;

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.360
in this episode we’re more concerned with amendments
Five and Six. And, most important, we’ll be explaining

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.080
some of the aspects of the legal system that you've
probably heard if you’ve ever watched a cop show.

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:50.060
[Theme Music]

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.140
Before we move forward, let's look at the
Fourteenth Amendment. You’ll remember from

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.769
episode 23 that the civil liberties enshrined
in the Bill of Rights initially applied only

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:00.370
to the federal government; state governments
could violate them until the cows came home,

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.019
which in 1789 was how they measured time.
This changed with the Fourteenth Amendment,

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.110
which allowed the Court to incorporate the
rights against the states over time. This

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.130
is especially important with criminal procedural
rights and liberties because most of the time

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.130
criminal cases are brought by state governments.

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.510
So the part of the Fourteenth Amendment that
applies here is "No state shall make or enforce

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:20.450
any law which shall abridge the privileges
or immunities of citizens of the United States;

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.220
nor shall any state deprive any person of
life, liberty, or property, without due process

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.200
of law; nor deny to any person within its
jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws."

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.440
You can see that it refers directly to states
and that it says they can’t deprive person

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.930
of life -- kill them – liberty – lock
them up – or property – fine them and

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:38.250
take away their stuff, without due process
of law. But what does it mean?

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.500
Serious fans of jurisprudence – and you
know who you are – know that there are two

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.780
concepts of due process floating around out
there. The first is substantive due process,

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.890
which is a blanket prohibition on government
infringing on fundamental liberties. If you

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.640
think that this is kind of vague, you’re not alone;
the courts generally don’t like to uphold claims

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.340
based on substantive due process because
then they’d have to define what it actually means.

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.900
Procedural due process, on the other hand,
is a different story. Under this doctrine,

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.340
the court looks at whether the government
acted properly in applying its power. Court

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.860
decisions established procedural limitations
on law enforcement and adjudication.

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.560
If the government followed these procedural rules,
then in general the courts will say that they didn’t

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.640
violate your due process rights. But what procedures
do they have to follow, and where do they come from?

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.120
When it comes to Due Process, the Fifth Amendment
to the Constitution does most of the heavy lifting.
Here’s what it says:

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.560
"No person shall be held to answer for a capital,
or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.599
or indictment of a grand jury, except in cases
arising in the land or naval forces, or in

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:32.280
the militia, when in actual service in time
of war or public danger; nor shall any person

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.959
be subject for the same offense to be twice
put in jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:39.459
be compelled in any criminal case to be a
witness against himself, nor be deprived of

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:43.259
life, liberty, or property, without due process
of law; nor shall private property be taken

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.300
for public use, without just compensation."

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.939
Notice that the second to last clause mentions
due process of law in language similar to

00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:52.249
what you would find in the 14th amendment
– imagine that – and the rest of the Amendment

00:02:52.249 --> 00:02:55.650
basically explains a lot of what due process
is. Let's go to the Thought Bubble.

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.700
The first clause basically says that if you
are charged with a crime, you are entitled

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.040
to a grand jury that must look at the evidence
and decide that there is enough to bring you

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.480
to trial. If the grand jury decides that there
is enough evidence, they issue an indictment,

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.480
and this means that, unless you make a plea
deal, you will have a trial – which almost

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.569
never happens because people usually make
plea deals.

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:13.700
We don't have to talk much about cases in
the land or naval forces; this just means

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.159
that soldiers and sailors who commit crimes
get tried in military courts, which becomes

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:20.379
quite important when you are talking about
potential terrorists, but that’s for another day.

00:03:20.389 --> 00:03:23.389
The second protection this Amendment gives
us is against double jeopardy – not the

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:27.290
good Alex Trebek kind -- the bad kind where
the state tries you for a crime, loses its

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:31.270
case and then decides to try you again for
the exact same crime. What is "Unfair"?

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:34.440
Legal types like to say that the government only
gets one bite at the apple, because legal

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:37.840
types love fruit. In case you are wondering,
the double jeopardy clause only applies to

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.299
convictions; if there is a mistrial in your
case and as a result you are neither convicted

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:43.549
nor acquitted, the state can bring you to
trial again.

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:46.670
The next clause, saying that you can’t be
compelled to be a witness against yourself,

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:50.029
is the most important one, at least in the
way we think about due process. This is the

00:03:50.029 --> 00:03:54.260
protection against self-incrimination, and it’s what we
mean when we say that someone “pleads the Fifth.”

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:59.820
The idea that you can’t be compelled to confess your own guilt is the basis of the famous first sentence in every arrest you ever see on TV:

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:03.149
“You have the right to remain silent, anything you
say may be used against you in a court of law.”

00:04:03.149 --> 00:04:06.900
You'll remember, that this warning comes
from the 1966 case Miranda v. Arizona.

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:10.239
The last clause in the 5th Amendment, is the
“just compensation” clause and it only

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:13.659
means that if the state takes away your property,
say to build a freeway through your front

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.480
yard, they can do it but they have to pay
you for it. This is the basis of what’s

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:19.849
called eminent domain, which is fascinating
but I don’t have time to go into it here.

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:21.460
I'm a busy man. Thanks, Thought Bubble.

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:25.180
So you can see that the 5th amendment goes a
long way toward protecting us from the state using its

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:29.540
power to put us in jail arbitrarily. Just think for a minute
about what the state could do to force confessions or

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:33.680
to keep bringing you to trial until they get a  conviction,
and you can see how important these rights are.

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.920
The fear that the state would use its legal
muscle to take away our liberties was so great,

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:40.230
that the writers of the Bill of Rights needed
two amendments to cover it all – three if

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:43.620
you count the 7th amendment which guarantees
the right to a jury trial. If the Fifth Amendment

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:48.080
provides some general procedural protections, then the
Sixth Amendment is more specific. Here’s what it says:

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:51.870
"In all criminal prosecutions, the accused
shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:55.010
trial, by an impartial jury of the state and
district wherein the crime shall have been

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:58.920
committed, which district shall have been previously
ascertained by law, and to be informed of the

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:02.960
nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted
with the witnesses against him; to have compulsory

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:07.180
process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and
to have the assistance of counsel for his defense."

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:09.020
So this explains what a fair trial looks like.

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:13.340
It must be speedy, which most states define in their
constitutions but usually means that you can be held for

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:18.000
45 days before you have to have a trial, unless you
waive this right in order to prepare a stronger defense.

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:21.980
The trial should be public – no royal courts
or star chambers – because transparency

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:24.870
is supposed to make them work better. You
have the right to a jury of your peers – not

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:28.580
a jury of policemen or government officials
or people who are basically likely to convict

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:31.320
you – although again you can waive your
right to a jury. And the trial is supposed

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:34.600
to be where you committed the crime, although
this doesn’t always apply exactly.

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:37.510
You have the right to know what you are charged
with – which makes total sense because if

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:40.250
you didn’t it would be pretty hard to put
up a good defense, and you must be able to

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:42.150
cross examine the witnesses brought against
you.

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:45.240
Probably most important, you have the right
to an attorney, although according to the

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:49.510
case Gideon v. Wainwright, this only applies
in felony cases, which I suppose makes sense

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:53.180
because these are the ones that are likely,
if you lose, to result in loss of liberty

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:56.880
or even life. Because the legal process, as
I hope you’re beginning to see, is kind

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:01.660
of complicated, you really, really need a lawyer if you're
ever gonna get arrested and charged with a crime.

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:04.740
That phrase, the right to an attorney, is
also part of the Miranda warning, so this

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:10.460
seems like a good place to try to explain
the Miranda case. I’ll try to be brief.

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:12.820
Stan made that pun. Terrible.

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:17.360
Miranda was arrested on suspicion of kidnapping
and rape after being identified in a police line up.

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:20.940
The police questioned him for two hours at
the end of which he confessed to the crime.

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:24.160
He was never told about his due process
rights, specifically the protection

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:27.730
against self-incrimination, which is what
he did in his confession. The confession was

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:31.740
the main evidence used to convict him, and
Miranda was sentenced to 20-30 years in prison.

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:35.540
He appealed – well, his lawyers did – claiming
that his 5th amendment rights were violated.

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:38.940
The court agreed and they went a bit further,
ruling that you don’t really have due process

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:42.470
protections unless you know about them. This
is why the police, when they arrest you, have

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:46.010
to tell you about your right to remain silent
– so you don’t incriminate yourself – and

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:49.210
your right to an attorney, provided by the
state if you can’t afford one, again because

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:51.440
if you have been arrested you're gonna need
one.

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:54.400
If you are going to take away one thing from
this case, don't make it my wallet cause that

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:58.090
will get you arrested. It should be this:
If the police take you into custody or even

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:01.410
want to ask you a few questions, you should
ask them if you are under arrest. If they

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:05.880
say no, then you can walk away from them.
If they say yes, the very next thing you should

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:08.940
say is, I’d like to speak with a lawyer,
and don’t say anything else to them until

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:12.290
you have a lawyer there. Well, you might be
able to ask for coffee. The good cop might

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:15.550
get it for you. The bad cop might throw it
in your face. So maybe don't ask for coffee.

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:18.820
This may seem silly, especially if you haven’t
done anything wrong but it’s important to

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:21.160
keep the police acting the way they are supposed
to act.

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:24.940
Court cases like Miranda and Gideon help to
define how agents of the state, in this case

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:28.790
law enforcement and judicial officers must
act so that they don’t unjustly infringe

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:32.449
on our liberties. In the case of trials, our
fundamental liberty – not being in jail

00:07:32.449 --> 00:07:34.330
– and maybe even our lives are at stake.

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:38.010
Yes it’s true that sometimes guilty people
go free because the police or courts don’t

00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:41.800
follow the rules scrupulously, and that can
be a bummer. But when you consider the alternative,

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:45.160
a government with the power to lock you up
whenever they feel like it, juries that are

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:48.720
biased in favor of conviction, and a system
where the state can bring you to trial again

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:52.160
and again until they get a conviction, I think
you’ll probably agree that it’s better

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:55.770
to have these procedural protections than
not to have them. Thanks for watching. See
