00:00:08.423 --> 00:00:12.018
A portly Miller, barely sober enough
to sit on his horse,

00:00:12.018 --> 00:00:15.967
rambles on about the flighty wife 
of a crotchety old carpenter

00:00:15.967 --> 00:00:18.808
and the scholar she takes as her lover.

00:00:18.808 --> 00:00:20.453
To get some time alone together,

00:00:20.453 --> 00:00:22.899
the scholar and the wife 
play various tricks

00:00:22.899 --> 00:00:24.755
that involve feigning madness,

00:00:24.755 --> 00:00:26.601
staging a biblical flood,

00:00:26.601 --> 00:00:29.119
and exposing themselves in public.

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:32.718
But the parish clerk 
is also lusting after the wife,

00:00:32.718 --> 00:00:36.220
and comes by every night 
to sing outside her house.

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:39.553
This becomes so tiresome 
that she tries to scare him away

00:00:39.553 --> 00:00:43.601
by hanging her rear end out the window 
for him to kiss.

00:00:43.601 --> 00:00:45.402
When this appears not to work,

00:00:45.402 --> 00:00:48.835
her scholar decides 
to try farting in the same position,

00:00:48.835 --> 00:00:53.820
but this time, the clerk 
is waiting with a red-hot poker.

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.902
This might all sound like a bawdy joke,

00:00:55.902 --> 00:01:00.605
but it’s part of one of the most esteemed 
works of English literature ever created:

00:01:00.605 --> 00:01:02.247
The Canterbury Tales,

00:01:02.247 --> 00:01:06.102
which seamlessly blends the lofty 
and the lowly.

00:01:06.102 --> 00:01:08.431
The work consists of 24 stories,

00:01:08.431 --> 00:01:12.377
each told by one 
of Chaucer’s spirited characters.

00:01:12.377 --> 00:01:14.940
Narrators include 
familiar Medieval figures

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:16.147
such as a Knight,

00:01:16.147 --> 00:01:17.201
a Clerk,

00:01:17.201 --> 00:01:18.475
and a Nun,

00:01:18.475 --> 00:01:20.385
and the less recognizable Reeve,

00:01:20.385 --> 00:01:21.802
and Mancible,

00:01:21.802 --> 00:01:23.162
and others.

00:01:23.162 --> 00:01:25.152
The Tales are written in Middle English,

00:01:25.152 --> 00:01:28.670
which often looks entirely different 
from the language spoken today.

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.417
It was used between the 12th 
and 15th centuries,

00:01:31.417 --> 00:01:33.351
and evolved from Old English

00:01:33.351 --> 00:01:36.742
due to increased contact 
with European romantic languages

00:01:36.742 --> 00:01:40.597
after the Norman Conquest of 1066.

00:01:40.597 --> 00:01:43.936
Most of the Middle English alphabet 
is still familiar today,

00:01:43.936 --> 00:01:46.788
with the inclusion 
of a few archaic symbols,

00:01:46.788 --> 00:01:49.588
such as yogh, which denotes the y,

00:01:49.588 --> 00:01:50.438
j,

00:01:50.438 --> 00:01:52.786
or gh sound.

00:01:52.786 --> 00:01:57.871
The loquacious cast of the Tales 
first meet at the Tabard Inn in Southwark.

00:01:57.871 --> 00:01:59.665
They have a journey in common:

00:01:59.665 --> 00:02:04.287
a pilgrimage to Canterbury 
to visit the shrine of St. Thomas Beckett,

00:02:04.287 --> 00:02:08.047
a martyred archbishop who was murdered 
in his own Cathedral.

00:02:08.047 --> 00:02:10.965
Eager and nosy
for some personal details,

00:02:10.965 --> 00:02:13.871
the host of the Inn 
proposes a competition:

00:02:13.871 --> 00:02:18.037
whoever tells the best tale 
will be treated to dinner.

00:02:18.037 --> 00:02:19.548
If not for their pilgrimage,

00:02:19.548 --> 00:02:23.520
many of these figures would never 
have had the chance to interact.

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.420
This is because Medieval society followed 
a feudal system

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.245
that divided the clergy and nobility 
from the working classes,

00:02:31.245 --> 00:02:34.057
made up of peasants and serfs.

00:02:34.057 --> 00:02:35.512
By Chaucer’s time,

00:02:35.512 --> 00:02:39.920
a professional class of merchants 
and intellectuals had also emerged.

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.217
Chaucer spent most of his life 
as a government official

00:02:43.217 --> 00:02:45.018
during the Hundred Years' War,

00:02:45.018 --> 00:02:49.241
traveling throughout Italy and France,
as well as his native England.

00:02:49.241 --> 00:02:52.351
This may have influenced
the panoramic vision of his work,

00:02:52.351 --> 00:02:56.839
and in the Tales,
no level of society is above mockery.

00:02:56.839 --> 00:02:59.686
Chaucer uses the quirks 
of the characters’ language –

00:02:59.686 --> 00:03:01.877
the ribald humor of the Cook,

00:03:01.877 --> 00:03:04.076
the solemn prose of the Parson,

00:03:04.076 --> 00:03:06.189
and the lofty notions of the Squire –

00:03:06.189 --> 00:03:08.855
to satirize their worldviews.

00:03:08.855 --> 00:03:12.044
The varied dialects, genres, 
and literary tropes

00:03:12.044 --> 00:03:14.001
also make the work a vivid record

00:03:14.001 --> 00:03:18.052
of the different ways Medieval audiences 
entertained themselves.

00:03:18.052 --> 00:03:21.190
For instance, the Knight’s tale 
of courtly love,

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:22.147
chivalry,

00:03:22.147 --> 00:03:23.338
and destiny

00:03:23.338 --> 00:03:24.845
riffs on romance,

00:03:24.845 --> 00:03:28.618
while the tales of working-class narrators
are generally comedies

00:03:28.618 --> 00:03:30.694
filled with scatological language,

00:03:30.694 --> 00:03:32.015
sexual deviance,

00:03:32.015 --> 00:03:33.548
and slapstick.

00:03:33.548 --> 00:03:36.666
This variation 
includes something for everyone,

00:03:36.666 --> 00:03:40.019
and that’s one reason why readers
continue to delight in the work

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:42.668
in both Middle English and translation.

00:03:42.668 --> 00:03:46.106
While the narrative runs 
to over 17,000 lines,

00:03:46.106 --> 00:03:48.093
it's apparently unfinished,

00:03:48.093 --> 00:03:51.584
as the prologue ambitiously 
introduces 29 pilgrims

00:03:51.584 --> 00:03:54.059
and promises four stories apiece,

00:03:54.059 --> 00:03:56.861
and the innkeeper never crowns a victor.

00:03:56.861 --> 00:04:00.717
It’s possible that Chaucer was
so caught up in his sumptuous creations

00:04:00.717 --> 00:04:02.733
that he delayed picking a winner -

00:04:02.733 --> 00:04:05.076
or perhaps he was so fond 
of each character

00:04:05.076 --> 00:04:07.144
that he just couldn’t choose.

00:04:07.144 --> 00:04:08.566
Whatever the reason,

00:04:08.566 --> 00:04:10.997
this means that every reader
is free to judge;

00:04:10.997 --> 00:04:13.669
the question of who wins is up to you.
