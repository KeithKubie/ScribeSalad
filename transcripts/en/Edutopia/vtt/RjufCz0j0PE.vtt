00:00:11.256 --> 00:00:12.466
&gt;&gt;David: One of the
biggest challenges

00:00:12.466 --> 00:00:15.536
that schools everywhere face
is engaging their students

00:00:15.536 --> 00:00:16.736
in the education process.

00:00:16.736 --> 00:00:18.126
Making school relevant.

00:00:18.256 --> 00:00:21.076
Making school matter to the
kids and their families.

00:00:21.656 --> 00:00:24.166
We're always looking for a school
that's nailed that challenge.

00:00:24.586 --> 00:00:27.046
In this month's, "Schools
that Work," installment,

00:00:27.046 --> 00:00:30.616
we go to the Ariel Community
Academy on the Southside of Chicago.

00:00:31.276 --> 00:00:34.646
Where with a student population
of modest means, they've seized

00:00:34.646 --> 00:00:37.966
on the vehicle of financial
literacy to engage the students

00:00:37.966 --> 00:00:40.636
and engage their families,
teaching kids about money.

00:00:40.636 --> 00:00:42.466
Teaching them about family economy.

00:00:42.766 --> 00:00:45.786
Teaching them about the critical
decision-making that's required

00:00:46.066 --> 00:00:49.926
to secure your future, secure
the future of your family.

00:00:50.356 --> 00:00:52.166
And to break the cycle of poverty.

00:00:52.666 --> 00:00:54.996
The results at Ariel
have been impressive,

00:00:55.366 --> 00:00:58.526
97 percent of the students are
graduating from high school;

00:00:58.686 --> 00:01:01.706
65 percent are matriculating
into college.

00:01:01.966 --> 00:01:05.466
We hope this installment of "Schools
that Work" will be an inspiration

00:01:05.466 --> 00:01:08.636
to you, and help you think about
the kinds of changes you can make

00:01:08.636 --> 00:01:10.766
to better engage your students.

00:01:17.976 --> 00:01:20.746
&gt;&gt;Lennette: Critical thinking
is what every school teaches,

00:01:21.036 --> 00:01:23.416
or hopes to teach,
or attempts to teach.

00:01:24.176 --> 00:01:26.436
But the thinking is not just enough.

00:01:27.156 --> 00:01:28.816
You've got to have action.

00:01:28.816 --> 00:01:33.936
And I think financial literacy
is the best venue for that,

00:01:33.936 --> 00:01:36.526
because what's more
global than money?

00:01:36.866 --> 00:01:40.456
&gt;&gt;Regina: This is a Title 1
school, so we have lots of kids

00:01:40.456 --> 00:01:42.726
who are living at or
below the poverty line.

00:01:43.466 --> 00:01:49.396
These are average kids who have
the absolute ability to learn

00:01:49.396 --> 00:01:52.946
and to understand finance and
economics, because it's couched

00:01:52.946 --> 00:01:56.996
in a way that relates to their
everyday life and relates

00:01:56.996 --> 00:01:59.166
to decisions that they
are actually making,

00:01:59.166 --> 00:02:00.946
or will have to make in the future.

00:02:41.746 --> 00:02:44.646
&gt;&gt;Lennette: Financial literacy
is a body of knowledge.

00:02:45.466 --> 00:02:49.146
Investing or entrepreneurship
are the subjects.

00:02:49.686 --> 00:02:53.136
&gt;&gt;Regina: So we have four main
components of the curriculum.

00:02:53.286 --> 00:02:55.886
First grade is personal finance.

00:02:55.886 --> 00:02:58.976
Second grade is a combination of
economics and personal finance,

00:02:59.056 --> 00:03:01.046
and third grade is
about monetary policy

00:03:01.046 --> 00:03:03.576
and what money is and
how does money work.

00:03:03.886 --> 00:03:06.526
Well, starting in fourth
grade, it's a lot more fluid.

00:03:07.136 --> 00:03:09.776
We want teachers to be
able to pick and choose.

00:03:09.776 --> 00:03:14.356
And so instead of teaching
specifically to the test,

00:03:14.596 --> 00:03:17.396
we strive to make everything
relevant.

00:03:18.436 --> 00:03:25.406
Ariel students typically score much
better in math and better in reading.

00:03:25.406 --> 00:03:26.576
&gt;&gt;Judith: The curriculum
needs to be deep.

00:03:27.796 --> 00:03:30.106
It needs to be encompassing.

00:03:30.906 --> 00:03:35.846
The point of student success
is for students to understand

00:03:36.296 --> 00:03:41.176
that with every single classroom
that they participate in,

00:03:41.466 --> 00:03:45.756
it is directly connected
to their own life goals.

00:03:47.496 --> 00:03:51.366
&gt;&gt;Regina: So our investments
class today, we're going to talk

00:03:51.366 --> 00:03:53.096
about spending our money.

00:03:53.096 --> 00:03:55.326
What did we do last
investments class?

00:03:55.326 --> 00:03:58.276
Who can think back and remember?

00:03:58.276 --> 00:04:00.816
what were we spending our money on?

00:04:01.266 --> 00:04:02.486
What were we doing?

00:04:03.236 --> 00:04:07.076
&gt;&gt;Student: Carnival things.

00:04:07.076 --> 00:04:08.636
&gt;&gt;Regina: Yeah, things
at the carnival!

00:04:09.116 --> 00:04:11.626
&gt;&gt;Regina: The kids
really respond well

00:04:11.626 --> 00:04:17.406
to seeing other children making
decisions in literature that we read.

00:04:17.406 --> 00:04:20.206
So either watching a video or
reading a book is a great way

00:04:20.206 --> 00:04:21.136
to get them invested.

00:04:21.136 --> 00:04:23.766
&gt;&gt;Regina: Listen to
this story carefully.

00:04:23.766 --> 00:04:27.416
Let's think, is this
about planned spending?

00:04:27.416 --> 00:04:28.726
Someone thought about it carefully?

00:04:28.776 --> 00:04:31.036
Or is this about unplanned spending?

00:04:31.036 --> 00:04:33.166
They just saw it and they bought it.

00:04:33.166 --> 00:04:38.486
"Penny ran to her room to get
some money from her savings bank."

00:04:38.686 --> 00:04:41.336
When she put money in that
bank, what is that called?

00:04:41.336 --> 00:04:44.226
When she was saving up all her money,
she put the money into the bank?

00:04:44.226 --> 00:04:44.586
Shanard?

00:04:44.956 --> 00:04:45.406
&gt;&gt;Shanard: Deposit.

00:04:45.406 --> 00:04:46.736
&gt;&gt;Regina: Yeah, she was
depositing her money.

00:04:47.276 --> 00:04:53.646
"Mom was going to get paper towels,
plant food and a book about flowers

00:04:53.646 --> 00:04:56.736
for Miss Kim's birthday present.

00:04:56.736 --> 00:05:00.746
Penny added a notebook
to mom's shopping list."

00:05:00.746 --> 00:05:04.106
A.J., Penny's mom made a shopping
list just like your parents did.

00:05:05.626 --> 00:05:08.346
&gt;&gt;Regina: This is super
important for all children.

00:05:08.346 --> 00:05:11.216
It's very important for
the kids that we teach.

00:05:11.686 --> 00:05:14.006
Low-income children
have fewer chances.

00:05:14.146 --> 00:05:16.596
they already have the
deck stacked against them.

00:05:17.066 --> 00:05:21.466
And oftentimes, they are not the
ones who are getting the opportunity

00:05:21.676 --> 00:05:25.226
to network, to meet people, and
to take charge of their lives,

00:05:25.226 --> 00:05:28.066
so that they can graduate high
school and either find a job

00:05:28.356 --> 00:05:30.256
or go on to higher education.

00:05:35.356 --> 00:05:39.406
&gt;&gt;Regina: These kids are on a track
to go to excellent high schools,

00:05:39.616 --> 00:05:41.276
and to be accepted into college.

00:05:41.536 --> 00:05:45.166
And we give them the tools,
and hopefully they take that,

00:05:45.506 --> 00:05:50.946
feel inspired, and plan their life
the way that they want to live.

00:05:52.486 --> 00:05:56.106
&gt;&gt;Lennette: What we really want kids
to get, to believe in themselves,

00:05:56.106 --> 00:05:57.886
to know, "I can do this."

00:05:58.066 --> 00:06:00.636
And that, "Yes, I'm going
to think critically.

00:06:00.636 --> 00:06:02.356
I'm going to come up
with a good game plan."

00:06:03.176 --> 00:06:06.666
You know, it's not just
thinking, you have to do it.

00:06:06.666 --> 00:06:08.256
You have to be active.
