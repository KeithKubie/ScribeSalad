00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:05.519
Plato was born in Athens 2,400 years ago and
is widely recognised as having been

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.360
the founder of philosophy.

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:09.520
In order to convey what he believed philosophy

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:13.459
could do for us, he made up a now-famous metaphor
about a cave.

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:15.300
&nbsp;
He compared human beings who had not learnt

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:19.950
how to philosophise to people living deep
in the side of a mountain, in a cave illuminated

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:25.150
only by the dim light of flickering torches.
In such gloom,&nbsp; they regularly mistake one

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:30.150
thing for another: halloumi for chicken, spam for ham.

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.250
&nbsp;
The task of philosophy is - quite literally

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.640
- illumination. It is to help guide us to
more meaningful and fulfilled lives.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.130
For Plato, we are so often in the dark about
our lives because we exist under the sway

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:48.040
of DOXA - the Ancient Greek term for “public
opinion”. Doxa is a tangle

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.820
of prejudice and ill-thought through impulses.
&nbsp;

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.200
It is the task of philosophy to straighten
out how we think

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.880
and to be more precise in our ideas.

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.660
One of the things Plato thought a lot about was love.

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.820
He came to the view that we would not fall
in love if we were not in certain psychological

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.080
ways 'incomplete'. We are drawn to people we

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.100
dimly sense can compensate us for certain
of our deficiencies of character, who can

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.840
make us whole. Love grows when we identify in

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.780
another person qualities we need more of in
ourselves in order to become better, more

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.860
rounded individuals.
&nbsp;

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.030
So the shy will often feel a distinct attraction
towards the confident.

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:31.409
The carefree towards the thoughtful.
The mild cheese towards the astringent pickle.

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.420
The sweet chocolate towards the
tart berries.

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.720
In his theories, Plato accords an important
role to beauty. It would have been easy for

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.799
him to dismiss beautiful things as merely
superficial.

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:43.909
Many philosophers have. But he believed that

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:49.180
beauty is an embodiment at a physical level
of what we would, at the psychological plane,

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:54.810
call goodness. When we say that this miniature Yorkshire pudding is 'beautiful', it is because we are

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:00.579
sensing the promise of what might be admirable
psychological qualities too. If it turned

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:07.839
into a person, we'd like who the miniature Yorkshire pudding was: it would be optimistic, open to experience,

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.120
a little cynical but generous.
&nbsp;

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:15.800
Beautiful things therefore have a hugely important function. They invite us to evolve in their

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:21.559
direction, to become as they are. Beauty can,
for Plato, educate our souls. It follows that

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:26.029
for Plato ugly things are serious matters too, for they parade dangerous

00:02:26.029 --> 00:02:30.809
and damaged characteristics in front of us.
We need to stay away from them, for they can

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:33.929
otherwise encourage us to be like they are.
&nbsp;

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:40.580
Athenian society was very focused on the rich,
like the louche aristocrat Alcibiades, and

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.749
sports celebrities, like the boxer Milo of
Croton.

00:02:44.749 --> 00:02:46.709
&nbsp;
Plato wasn’t impressed: it really matters

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:52.010
who we admire, for celebrities influence our
outlook, ideas and conduct. And bad heroes

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.510
give glamour to flaws of character.
&nbsp;

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.579
Plato therefore wanted to give Athens new
celebrities, replacing the current crop with

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:04.010
ideally wise and good people he called Guardians:
models for everyone’s good development.

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.249
These people would be distinguished by their
record of public service, their modesty and

00:03:08.249 --> 00:03:12.940
simple habits, their dislike of the limelight
and their wide and deep experience.

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.219
Plato was a noted anti-democrat

00:03:15.219 --> 00:03:19.779
He simply didn't believe everyone should be
allowed to vote. But he wasn't in favour of

00:03:19.779 --> 00:03:24.049
a voting elite based on money or class. He
believed that people should be allowed to

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:28.619
vote only if they could demonstrate that they
had exercised thought and judgement.

00:03:28.619 --> 00:03:30.519
&nbsp;
He was an aristocrat of the mind.

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:35.439
He was also an idealist, someone who looks
at the way things are now, and tries to imagine

00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:39.129
how they could be better one day. We still
sometimes use the term ‘Platonic Ideal’

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:40.480
in his honour.

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.480
This is a Dolmades

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:44.930
This is a platonic Dolmades.

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.280
This is an egg.

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.460
This is a platonic egg.

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:53.599
In Plato's perfect society, described in his
book The Republic,

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:57.719
It wouldn't just be boxers, merchants and chefs who would be

00:03:57.719 --> 00:04:03.439
venerated, but primarily philosophers, people
devoted to self-knowledge, wisdom and kindness.

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:06.529
&nbsp;As he put it, 'Society will only be put right

00:04:06.529 --> 00:04:10.900
when philosophers become kings; or kings philosophers.'&nbsp;

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.840
We continue to agree.
