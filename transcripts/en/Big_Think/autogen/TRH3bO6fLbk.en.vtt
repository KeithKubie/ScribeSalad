countries are way off track at this

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:24.740
countries are way off track at this
 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:26.589
countries are way off track at this
stage many countries particularly in

Africa are way off track and if we're

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:29.840
Africa are way off track and if we're
 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:31.690
Africa are way off track and if we're
now have more than halfway through that

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:31.700
now have more than halfway through that
 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.270
now have more than halfway through that
period the goal was set in 2000 the

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280
period the goal was set in 2000 the
 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:39.220
period the goal was set in 2000 the
target is 2015 and if we are to have a

target is 2015 and if we are to have a
 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.620
target is 2015 and if we are to have a
chance of achieving that there needs to

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:41.630
chance of achieving that there needs to
 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:43.810
chance of achieving that there needs to
be a much greater urgency and indeed

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:43.820
be a much greater urgency and indeed
 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.210
be a much greater urgency and indeed
more resources and it's getting going to

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:46.220
more resources and it's getting going to
 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:47.860
more resources and it's getting going to
be get become more difficult to get

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:47.870
be get become more difficult to get

those resources in the current economic

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:50.180
those resources in the current economic
 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.530
those resources in the current economic
climate so it goes back to the point I

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:53.540
climate so it goes back to the point I
 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.570

made earlier that the resources we have

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:55.580
made earlier that the resources we have
 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:59.980
made earlier that the resources we have
at our disposal the development

00:00:59.980 --> 00:00:59.990
at our disposal the development
 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:02.100
at our disposal the development
community and let's put it that way

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:02.110
community and let's put it that way
 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:04.240
community and let's put it that way
those resources are going to have to

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250
those resources are going to have to
 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:05.770
those resources are going to have to
reuse very intelligent and very

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780
reuse very intelligent and very
 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.249
reuse very intelligent and very
strategically and the partnership that

00:01:09.249 --> 00:01:09.259
strategically and the partnership that
 

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:11.490
strategically and the partnership that
is implicit in achieving those goals

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:11.500
is implicit in achieving those goals
 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.800
is implicit in achieving those goals
between countries themselves the

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810
between countries themselves the
 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:16.990
between countries themselves the
ownership of their development process

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000
ownership of their development process
 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.899
ownership of their development process
and the other development actors the

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:19.909
and the other development actors the
 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:22.840
and the other development actors the
donors the NGOs and so on that those

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850
donors the NGOs and so on that those
 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:24.969
donors the NGOs and so on that those
partnerships have to really work because

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979
partnerships have to really work because
 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:26.710
partnerships have to really work because
if they do work then you can do a lot

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720
if they do work then you can do a lot
 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.220
if they do work then you can do a lot
more with the resources a job
