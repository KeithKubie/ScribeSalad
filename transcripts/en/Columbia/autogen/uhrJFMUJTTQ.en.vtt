columbia college and the School of
 

00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:48.650
columbia college and the School of
Engineering and so on so we've sort of

00:08:48.650 --> 00:08:48.660
Engineering and so on so we've sort of
 

00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:52.130
Engineering and so on so we've sort of
moved into this multicolored you know

00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:52.140
moved into this multicolored you know
 

00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:54.260

00:08:58.340 --> 00:08:58.350
and I think have evolved a real core set
 

00:08:58.350 --> 00:09:01.400
and I think have evolved a real core set
of strategic objectives instead of just

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:01.410
of strategic objectives instead of just
 

00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:03.320
of strategic objectives instead of just
sort of getting through the you know the

00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:03.330
sort of getting through the you know the
 

00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:07.040
