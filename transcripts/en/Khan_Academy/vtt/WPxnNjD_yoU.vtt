00:00:00.396 --> 00:00:02.536
- [Instructor] Flavia wanted
to estimate the mean age

00:00:02.536 --> 00:00:05.230
of the faculty members
at her large university.

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:08.631
She took an SRS, or simple random sample,

00:00:08.631 --> 00:00:12.499
of 20 of the approximately
700 faculty members,

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:15.869
and each faculty member in
the sample provided Flavia

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:16.896
with their age.

00:00:16.896 --> 00:00:19.996
The data were skewed to the
right with a sample mean

00:00:19.996 --> 00:00:20.829
of 38.75.

00:00:22.835 --> 00:00:24.661
She's considering using her data

00:00:24.661 --> 00:00:27.392
to make a confidence interval
to estimate the mean age

00:00:27.392 --> 00:00:29.452
of faculty members at her university.

00:00:29.452 --> 00:00:33.206
Which conditions for
constructing a t interval

00:00:33.206 --> 00:00:34.809
have been met?

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:37.035
So pause this video and
see if you can answer this

00:00:37.035 --> 00:00:38.679
on your own.

00:00:38.679 --> 00:00:42.221
Okay, now let's try to
answer this together.

00:00:42.221 --> 00:00:46.023
So there's 700 faculty members over here.

00:00:46.023 --> 00:00:49.749
She's trying to estimate the
population mean, the mean age.

00:00:49.749 --> 00:00:53.049
She can't talk to all 700,
so she takes a sample,

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:57.216
a simple random sample of 20,
so the n is equal to 20 here.

00:00:58.254 --> 00:01:02.421
From this 20, she calculates
a sample mean of 38.75.

00:01:04.066 --> 00:01:06.997
Now ideally, she wants to
construct a t interval,

00:01:06.997 --> 00:01:09.174
a confidence interval,
using the t statistic

00:01:09.174 --> 00:01:12.243
and so that interval would
look something like this.

00:01:12.243 --> 00:01:16.410
It would be the sample mean
plus or minus the critical value

00:01:17.307 --> 00:01:20.224
times the sample standard deviation

00:01:21.166 --> 00:01:23.954
divided by the square root of n.

00:01:23.954 --> 00:01:27.111
And we use a t statistic
like this and a t table

00:01:27.111 --> 00:01:29.825
and a t distribution when
we are trying to create

00:01:29.825 --> 00:01:34.364
confidence intervals for means
where we don't have access

00:01:34.364 --> 00:01:38.005
to the standard deviation of
the sampling distribution,

00:01:38.005 --> 00:01:41.715
but we can compute the
sample standard deviation.

00:01:41.715 --> 00:01:44.118
Now in order for this to hold
true, there's three conditions

00:01:44.118 --> 00:01:46.624
just like what we saw when
we thought about z intervals.

00:01:46.624 --> 00:01:50.124
The first is is that our sample is random.

00:01:51.171 --> 00:01:52.406
Well, they tell us that here

00:01:52.406 --> 00:01:54.863
that she took a simple
random sample of 20,

00:01:54.863 --> 00:01:57.736
and so we know that we are
meeting that constraint,

00:01:57.736 --> 00:01:58.894
and that's actually choice A,

00:01:58.894 --> 00:02:01.736
the data is a random sample
from the population of interest,

00:02:01.736 --> 00:02:04.008
so we can circle that in.

00:02:04.008 --> 00:02:07.572
So the next condition
is the normal condition.

00:02:07.572 --> 00:02:10.804
Now the normal condition
when we're doing a t interval

00:02:10.804 --> 00:02:13.825
is a little bit more involved
because we do need to assume

00:02:13.825 --> 00:02:16.847
that the sampling distribution
of the sample means

00:02:16.847 --> 00:02:18.928
is roughly normal.

00:02:18.928 --> 00:02:20.999
Now there's a couple of
ways that we can get there.

00:02:20.999 --> 00:02:25.792
Either our sample size is
greater than or equal to 30.

00:02:25.792 --> 00:02:27.501
The central limit theorem tells us

00:02:27.501 --> 00:02:29.145
that then our sampling distribution,

00:02:29.145 --> 00:02:32.210
regardless of what the
distribution is in the population,

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:34.911
that the sampling distribution
actually would then be

00:02:34.911 --> 00:02:36.807
approximately normal.

00:02:36.807 --> 00:02:39.413
She didn't mean that
constraint right over here.

00:02:39.413 --> 00:02:41.525
Here, her sample size is only 20,

00:02:41.525 --> 00:02:43.836
so so far this isn't looking good.

00:02:43.836 --> 00:02:46.481
Now that's not the only way
to meet the normal condition.

00:02:46.481 --> 00:02:49.132
Another way to meet the normal condition,

00:02:49.132 --> 00:02:52.346
if we have a smaller
sample size smaller than 30

00:02:52.346 --> 00:02:57.124
is one, if the original
distribution of ages is normal,

00:02:57.124 --> 00:02:59.791
so original distribution normal,

00:03:03.162 --> 00:03:06.398
or even if it's roughly
symmetric around the mean,

00:03:06.398 --> 00:03:08.648
so approximately symmetric,

00:03:10.462 --> 00:03:11.632
but if look at it, this,

00:03:11.632 --> 00:03:14.135
they tell us that it has right skew.

00:03:14.135 --> 00:03:17.061
They say the data were skewed to the right

00:03:17.061 --> 00:03:20.115
with the sample mean of 38.75.

00:03:20.115 --> 00:03:22.424
So that tells us that the data set

00:03:22.424 --> 00:03:25.963
that we're getting in our
sample is not symmetric,

00:03:25.963 --> 00:03:29.456
and the original distribution
is unlikely to be normal.

00:03:29.456 --> 00:03:30.421
Think about it.

00:03:30.421 --> 00:03:32.889
It's not going to be, you're
likely to have people who are,

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:35.116
you could have faculty
members who are 30 years older

00:03:35.116 --> 00:03:37.114
than this, 68 and three quarters,

00:03:37.114 --> 00:03:39.082
but you're very unlikely
to have faculty members

00:03:39.082 --> 00:03:40.694
who are 30 years younger than this,

00:03:40.694 --> 00:03:44.293
and that's actually what's
causing that skew to the right.

00:03:44.293 --> 00:03:47.144
So this one does not meet
the normal condition.

00:03:47.144 --> 00:03:49.712
We can't feel good that
our sampling distribution

00:03:49.712 --> 00:03:51.811
of the sample means is going to be normal,

00:03:51.811 --> 00:03:54.055
so I'm not gonna fill that one in.

00:03:54.055 --> 00:03:56.897
Choice C: Individual
observations can be considered

00:03:56.897 --> 00:03:57.988
independent.

00:03:57.988 --> 00:03:59.916
So there's two ways to
meet this constraint.

00:03:59.916 --> 00:04:02.583
One is is if we sample with replacement.

00:04:02.583 --> 00:04:04.656
Every faculty member we look at after

00:04:04.656 --> 00:04:06.557
asking them their age, we say,

00:04:06.557 --> 00:04:08.584
"Hey, go back into the pool
and we might pick 'em again

00:04:08.584 --> 00:04:10.533
"until we get our sample of 20."

00:04:10.533 --> 00:04:12.823
It does not look like she did that.

00:04:12.823 --> 00:04:15.111
It doesn't look like she
sampled with replacement,

00:04:15.111 --> 00:04:17.622
and so even if you're
sampling without replacement,

00:04:17.622 --> 00:04:22.159
the 10% rule says that, "Look,
as long as this is less than

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:26.122
"10% or less than or equal
to 10% of the population,

00:04:26.122 --> 00:04:29.163
"then we're good," and
the 10% of this population

00:04:29.163 --> 00:04:33.732
is 70; 70 is 10% of 700,
and so this is definitely

00:04:33.732 --> 00:04:37.926
less than or equal to 10%,
and so it can be considered

00:04:37.926 --> 00:04:41.644
independent, and so we can
actually meet that constraint

00:04:41.644 --> 00:04:42.835
as well.

00:04:42.835 --> 00:04:46.020
So the main issue where our t
interval might not be so good

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:47.969
is that our sampling distribution,

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:52.136
we can't feel so confidant that
that is going to be normal.
