AMBARISH KENGHE:
Welcome to our talk.

00:00:01.541 --> 00:00:03.450
We're going to talk
about making Google Cast

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:06.960
apps more discoverable.

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.224
And my name is
Ambarish Kenghe, I'm

00:00:09.224 --> 00:00:11.807
one of the product managers on
the Google Cast and Chrome Cast

00:00:11.807 --> 00:00:12.280
team.

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:12.740
And--

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:13.573
AMY WU: And I'm Amy.

00:00:13.573 --> 00:00:17.362
I'm currently a product
manager on the Play Store team.

00:00:17.362 --> 00:00:19.320
AMBARISH KENGHE: To start
with, how many of you

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.730
know about what Google
Cast and Chrome Cast is?

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:24.230
Cool.

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.940
Awesome.

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:26.760
So I'll quickly--
just to set context--

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.490
I'll quickly go through
what Google Cast is

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:30.900
and how the ecosystem works.

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.320
And then we'll get into
how the apps are discovered

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.172
and what you guys can do to
make them more discoverable.

00:00:36.172 --> 00:00:38.430
So essentially, what we
have in this ecosystem is

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.440
we have two sides of
the equation here.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.330
We have a set of
devices and we have

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:45.460
a set of sort of receiving
devices and sending devices.

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.600
And Google Cast is a
technology to enable

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.597
exciting multi-screen
experiences.

00:00:51.597 --> 00:00:53.180
So essentially, what
you're able to do

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.210
with Google Cast is
you're able to make TVs

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.550
and large displays an
extension of a personal device,

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.580
like mobile, tablet and phone
that you already have on you.

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:05.690
The basic idea
here is that you're

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.950
leveraging the interaction
model that you're already

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:11.104
used to on phones,
tablets, and PCs.

00:01:11.104 --> 00:01:12.520
The keyboards that
you're used to,

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.061
the touch screen
that you're used to.

00:01:14.061 --> 00:01:16.520
So you're leveraging
that model to interact,

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.520
but you're still able to use
the power of a big screen

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.190
and a powerful speaker
in your living room.

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:24.830
On the other side
as a developer,

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:26.720
what you're able
to do is you don't

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.840
have to write an application
from scratch here.

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.510
For a TV display,
for example, you

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:34.400
don't have to create a new
deeper interaction model,

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.090
you don't have to think about
information density there.

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.150
You can just leverage the
apps that you already have,

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:42.660
use all that model that
you've already built,

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.640
and then just use the TV
for displaying information

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.000
and creating sound
that you need to do

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.150
from that kind of a display.

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.660
Now, what we are doing is we
are building this technology

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.355
into a variety of
receiving device.

00:01:55.355 --> 00:01:56.980
So we've shown you
Chrome Cast-- Chrome

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:59.900
Cast has this technology built
in-- we announced Android

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.290
TV yesterday so Android TVs has
the Cast technology built in.

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:05.010
And you'll see a
variety of other devices

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:06.990
which will have this
technology built

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.400
into them over the next
few months and years.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.560
On the sender side, we have SDKs
for iOS, Android and Chrome.

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.920
So if you have
apps across these,

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.210
you can easily get the
SDK and enable your apps

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:23.360
for a Google Cast experience.

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.450
So that's a quick overview of
what Google Cast and Chrome

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.290
Cast is.

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.210
Now we'll talk a
little bit about what

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.390
we are doing to
surface applications

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.440
that you build because users
need to discover applications

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.830
that are Google Cast enabled.

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.930
So I'll have Amy start
the discovery experiences

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.030
with Android and then
we'll go ahead and talk

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.649
about iOS and Chrome later on.

00:02:45.649 --> 00:02:47.190
AMY WU: So the first
thing we've done

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.910
is create a permanent
place in the Play Store

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.510
where users can go and find
and browse Chrome Cast apps.

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.750
There's a couple different
ways to get there.

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.736
The first of which is in
the Play Store itself,

00:02:57.736 --> 00:02:59.110
if you go there
directly, there's

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:00.900
a Chrome Cast tile
that's permanent

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.340
where you can go
and consistently

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.780
be able to find the
Chrome Cast app page.

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.480
The other way is
if they actually go

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.574
to chromecast.com/apps.

00:03:10.574 --> 00:03:11.990
If you have the
Play Store enabled

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:14.980
that will also direct you to
this page on the Play Store

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:16.610
app.

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:17.110
Next.

00:03:19.615 --> 00:03:22.240
So on this page itself, there's
a couple of different sections.

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:25.930
There's Featured, there's
New and then there's

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:31.890
More Apps, all of which expand
to a fuller page of apps

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.740
that are enabled
for Chrome Cast.

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:39.180
The other primary way that users
kind of browse and discover

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.540
apps in the Play Store is
through Search, of course.

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:45.670
And so when users search for
a Chrome Cast related content,

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:48.550
then they will find Cast
enabled apps there as well.

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:53.660
And finally, we
basically, on the store,

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:55.380
are always looking
for ways to create

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:58.240
a much more personal experience
for users so that each of them

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.410
seem content that's relevant.

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:03.180
One way to do that, of
course, is on the homepage.

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.980
In this case, for apps, the
surface content that we think

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:08.370
are especially relevant for you.

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.130
If you're a Chrome Cast owner,
for instance, in this case,

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:14.560
well, actually--
we know that Cast

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.430
enabled apps would be
especially good for you

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.870
so we actually insert them
on the home page as well.

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:22.860
In this case, the apps
for Chrome Pass section

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.280
goes to the same collections
page that you saw earlier.

00:04:28.896 --> 00:04:31.890
AMBARISH KENGHE: And we
have, like Amy talked about

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:35.669
on Android, chromecast.com/apps
will automatically redirect

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:37.960
to the Play Store page and
we've created a special page

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.930
for Chrome Cast and
Google Cast on Android.

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:44.900
So you can discover all the
Google Cast apps right there.

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.300
On iOS as well, you
can just-- if you go

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:51.630
to chromecast.com/apps it
automatically gets redirected

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:54.490
to a special page that we
have then where we have apps

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:55.670
discovery experience.

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:57.650
And you get the same set
of applications there.

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:59.733
But in this case, you're
going to get applications

00:04:59.733 --> 00:05:02.140
that are enabled for iOS.

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:03.900
If you click on
our app here, it'll

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.840
automatically take you to
the app store, and from there

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.021
you can install the
application and that

00:05:09.021 --> 00:05:11.020
just works as it was
working for you in Android.

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:13.510
We just automatically
redirecting to the app store

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:16.055
and the app gets
installed on your device.

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:24.810
You can also go to the web
experience on the laptop.

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:27.500
Again, you're going to
chromecast.com/app which is,

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:29.710
again, prominently displayed
on your home screen.

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:32.280
You go to this experience
and, again, you

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:35.490
have the Featured,
New and More Sections.

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:37.350
In this experience if
you click on an app,

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:39.980
you get an option to
either go to the website

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:43.170
or you can install the
iOS or the Android app

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:47.440
onto your mobile devices
directly from this website.

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:52.981
So we give you a quick
overview and we sort of

00:05:52.981 --> 00:05:54.980
announced this yesterday
at the keynote as well.

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:57.490
We give you a quick
overview of what

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:59.890
we are doing to make
apps discoverable.

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:01.580
We're continuing to
work more on that

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:03.910
and you'll see in the
coming weeks and months

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:06.300
that this gets more
interesting and we'll

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:08.730
do more things to make
apps discoverable.

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:10.570
Now, I want to talk a
little bit about what

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:13.920
you can do to make these
apps more discoverable,

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:17.660
help us service your
apps are better.

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:20.530
So how many have you
have published an app

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:24.260
on the developer console, on
the Cast developer console?

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:25.540
Awesome.

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:27.740
So if you've already
published an app,

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:30.314
I wanted you to go to the-- and
you haven't gone back there,

00:06:30.314 --> 00:06:32.230
I want you to go back
to the developer console

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:35.620
as quickly as you can and enter
the information that we're

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:37.010
going to talk about next.

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:39.702
If you have not published
an application, then

00:06:39.702 --> 00:06:41.910
through the flow we are
going to-- before you publish

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:46.734
the app-- we're going to ask you
to provide us this information.

00:06:46.734 --> 00:06:48.150
So if you publish
the app, you hit

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:51.630
on the-- you click
on the Edit button

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:54.270
on your app on the
developer console

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:56.270
and you'll be presented
with a bunch of details.

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:59.270
The one that I wanted to
specifically point out

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:02.637
is the details about your iOS,
Android and web applications

00:07:02.637 --> 00:07:04.220
because these are
the links that we're

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:06.190
going to use to [? surface ?]
your applications

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:08.010
in the app discovery
experiences.

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:11.810
So be sure that
this part is right.

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:14.186
And at the same time,
you want to be sure

00:07:14.186 --> 00:07:15.560
that you don't
put in duplicates.

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:18.420
For example, just in case if
you have multiple receivers

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:21.990
for your application or if
you're publishing applications

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:24.570
that you really don't want to
be made public to the world,

00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:26.330
then don't publish it yet.

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:28.980
Use it as an
unpublished application

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:30.660
on your whitelisted devices.

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:32.910
Once you're ready to publish,
enter this information,

00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:33.890
publish it.

00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:36.350
Know that once you
enter these links,

00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:38.870
we will make them public in
the apps discovery experience

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:40.820
and from there users
will be able to discover

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:41.569
these experiences.

00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:47.634
And also, while we're not
right now using the category

00:07:47.634 --> 00:07:49.050
information that
you're providing,

00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:53.430
we have three tabs
right now-- Featured,

00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:55.800
New and More-- we
do want you to put

00:07:55.800 --> 00:08:01.320
in the right information in
the categories drop down there.

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:04.020
Because in future, as we try
to categorize your applications

00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:05.760
better, if you
have that category

00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:07.610
there we'll be able
to do that for you.

00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:12.210
And next, the other
thing I wanted

00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:14.430
to point out on the
developer console

00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:17.550
is your title and the image.

00:08:17.550 --> 00:08:21.600
For the graphics, just go
to various experiences--

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:25.620
the iOS and the web especially
on chromecast.com/apps--

00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:28.410
and make sure that this icon and
graphics is going to look good

00:08:28.410 --> 00:08:29.040
there.

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:32.630
And we have specifications on
how big this graphic should be

00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:33.700
and how it should look.

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:35.730
And make sure you're providing
the right information to us

00:08:35.730 --> 00:08:36.299
there.

00:08:36.299 --> 00:08:39.360
On Android we've already
leveraged the information

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:41.789
you have given to
us on the Play Store

00:08:41.789 --> 00:08:44.630
so you already have the
graphics and description there

00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:48.450
that we can just reuse there.

00:08:48.450 --> 00:08:50.720
So that's pretty
much all you would

00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:56.000
need to do in terms of
enabling the experience.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:01.040
Enter this information and save
and that makes your application

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:03.570
public.

00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:04.990
So that's about it.

00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:07.060
I wanted to sort of
open it up for questions

00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:09.262
and talk about anything
you may have there.

00:09:09.262 --> 00:09:10.137
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:16.165 --> 00:09:17.123
AMBARISH KENGHE: Sorry.

00:09:17.123 --> 00:09:17.800
It's too loud.

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:19.263
Yeah.

00:09:19.263 --> 00:09:20.560
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:22.520
Sasha from [INAUDIBLE] Media.

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:24.710
So by publishing
our application--

00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:28.660
I'm sorry-- it will be
discoverable by users

00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:32.190
through the Search, right?

00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:34.950
If my application,
our application,

00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:41.890
requires a mobile side-- so
it doesn't work as Chrome Cast

00:09:41.890 --> 00:09:45.410
application at all-- and I don't
want it to be discoverable,

00:09:45.410 --> 00:09:47.520
can I hide it?

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:50.450
Because our use case is, I
have my mobile application

00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:52.220
but discover Chrome Cast.

00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:55.000
And then my mobile
application communicates

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.680
with a Chrome Cast,
launches [INAUDIBLE],

00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:00.910
and only that scenario is valid.

00:10:00.910 --> 00:10:03.600
Users don't need
even to see that we

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:07.670
have another side
published on a Chrome Cast.

00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:09.080
You understand the scenario?

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:09.270
AMBARISH KENGHE: No.

00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:11.020
Actually I don't
understand your question.

00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:13.265
So you're saying you have
a mobile application.

00:10:13.265 --> 00:10:13.890
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:17.880
My-- our scenario
it's live streaming,

00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:19.030
live video streaming.

00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:22.390
And we developed the
receiver for the Chrome Cast.

00:10:22.390 --> 00:10:26.580
Now, that receiver we cannot
launch without our mobile

00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:29.440
application, our own
mobile application.

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:36.180
There is no any other mechanism
to launch our Chrome Cast

00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:37.880
receiver application, right?

00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:43.210
So in this sense, when I
publish our receiver application

00:10:43.210 --> 00:10:45.070
I don't want it to
be discoverable.

00:10:45.070 --> 00:10:45.850
AMBARISH KENGHE: I
see your question.

00:10:45.850 --> 00:10:47.280
So in this-- just to clarify.

00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:49.710
We are making the
receiver public.

00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:51.710
What we are doing is
we're making a link

00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:53.400
to your mobile
application public.

00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:55.400
So once you publish
a receiver, what--

00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:57.675
in the end, the
receivers, nobody really

00:10:57.675 --> 00:10:59.800
has links to the receivers
from a user perspective.

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:01.820
They don't care
about the receiver.

00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:04.350
All they care about is
the mobile application

00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:06.490
which will help them to
launch your receiver.

00:11:06.490 --> 00:11:08.940
So really what this is
doing is you're providing us

00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:11.700
links to your Android, iOS
and Chrome applications,

00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:14.209
and then that's allowing the
users to launch the receivers.

00:11:14.209 --> 00:11:15.750
So, yes, the receivers,
nobody really

00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:16.780
needs to know about them.

00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:17.010
Yes.

00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:17.551
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:11:17.551 --> 00:11:18.569
Thank you.

00:11:18.569 --> 00:11:19.485
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:11:21.564 --> 00:11:23.230
AMBARISH KENGHE:
That's a good question.

00:11:23.230 --> 00:11:28.000
I think that's-- right now what
we do is we do it organically

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.802
where we hunt for applications
and we look for people who have

00:11:30.802 --> 00:11:32.260
developed interesting
applications.

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:35.020
What would help you
on getting featured

00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:37.390
is we have UX
guidelines on the web.

00:11:37.390 --> 00:11:40.270
So if you can make sure that
your app follows those UX

00:11:40.270 --> 00:11:42.730
guidelines really well,
that's number one.

00:11:42.730 --> 00:11:45.870
Two, you want to make sure
the use case that you have

00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:47.710
is interesting use
case for Chrome Cast,

00:11:47.710 --> 00:11:49.210
that makes sense for users.

00:11:49.210 --> 00:11:54.440
And then we would discover them
as they pop up in the list.

00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:56.381
We look at a bunch
of stuff the signals

00:11:56.381 --> 00:11:57.880
in terms of what's
happening and how

00:11:57.880 --> 00:11:59.380
people are using
these applications.

00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:01.710
We're constantly on a hunt
for featured applications.

00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:04.180
Because in the end, for
us, it's great to have

00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:06.910
interesting applications
up there on that list.

00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:09.250
So if you're following those
guidelines and users are

00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:11.208
starting to use it, we'll
definitely notice it.

00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:19.600
AUDIENCE: I haven't got a chance
to look at the Chrome Cast app

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:20.670
store page.

00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:23.600
So how does the plus
one thing works there?

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:26.140
If I get somebody to plus
one the Chrome Cast app,

00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:29.340
does it reflect to the
organic listing also?

00:12:34.479 --> 00:12:35.590
AMY WU: On the Play Store?

00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:37.310
Yeah.

00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:40.870
If you have a plus--
so if in your circles,

00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:42.900
one of those people
plus ones, let's say,

00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:45.580
one of the Chrome Cast apps,
that would personal-- so,

00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:47.650
essentially, that
would send that app

00:12:47.650 --> 00:12:50.010
to the top of your list
because our list is basically

00:12:50.010 --> 00:12:52.714
personalized within a collection
based on what we think--

00:12:52.714 --> 00:12:53.630
is that your question?

00:12:53.630 --> 00:12:55.755
AUDIENCE: Will I see, even
if I'm not a Chrome Cast

00:12:55.755 --> 00:12:58.570
user, if I never connected my
account with a Chrome Cast,

00:12:58.570 --> 00:13:00.798
will I still get
to see that app?

00:13:00.798 --> 00:13:02.010
AMY WU: Oh, I see.

00:13:02.010 --> 00:13:04.960
So if you don't have a
Chrome Cast yourself,

00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:08.240
you won't see that
collection on the home page.

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:12.510
But you can still access the
Chrome Cast tile that you saw.

00:13:12.510 --> 00:13:14.330
You can get to the
collection that way.

00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:17.820
But because we don't
think the collection would

00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:19.900
be as relevant for
you, we don't actually

00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:20.934
put it on the home page.

00:13:20.934 --> 00:13:21.475
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:13:27.935 --> 00:13:29.310
AMBARISH KENGHE:
Other questions?

00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:34.520
OK.

00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:35.020
Cool.

00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:37.170
Looks like we can all get
back to the game there.

00:13:37.170 --> 00:13:38.720
Thanks.
