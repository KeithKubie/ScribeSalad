MATT MAGER: So what
happens when four stars

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:09.490
leave the bright
lights of Broadway

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:13.150
and take leading roles in a
small town controversy making

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:15.070
national headlines?

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:20.010
Big drama, bigger laughs,
and honestly, one of the best

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.290
musicals I've ever seen.

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:25.110
Trust me, you will love
it when you see it.

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:26.610
Let's start off
with a little video.

MATT MAGER: Thank you.

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:51.380
That was so great.

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:54.170
Have a seat.

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:57.020
So that was one of the great
numbers in the musical,

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:59.000
and I'd like to invite
the rest of the cast

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.070
to join us so we can
start asking them

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:03.610
some questions about the show.

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:04.350
Hi.

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:05.050
Hey, everyone.

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:05.550
Yeah.

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:22.980
So thank you all for
joining us today.

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:24.560
This is a really awesome panel.

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:27.194
I'm so excited to
have all of you here.

00:05:27.194 --> 00:05:29.360
I'm going to hop right in
because I know that we all

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.220
have tons of questions.

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:36.450
Four Broadway stars
hungry for attention

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:39.210
have had some bad publicity.

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:43.830
They decide to go and
help a teenage lesbian who

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:48.090
has been told that she can't
go to the prom with her date.

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:51.040
And they say, we can fix this.

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:53.020
Honestly, when I
saw that, I thought

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:55.490
it was maybe a hard sell.

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:58.280
I was like, all
right, well I'm gay.

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:00.160
Would I go see this?

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:01.820
And then I saw it
and I was like,

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:03.660
this is amazing, honestly.

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:10.630
I want to start first with kind
of the process by which you all

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:13.330
got attached to this
because I imagine

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:16.660
I'm not the only person that was
like, hm, interesting concept.

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:19.512
How did you all get involved?

00:06:19.512 --> 00:06:20.720
BROOKS ASHMANSKAS: The money.

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:22.805
ANGIE SCHWORER: Casey Nicholaw.

00:06:22.805 --> 00:06:25.076
BROOKS ASHMANSKAS:
Yeah, Casey Nicholaw,

00:06:25.076 --> 00:06:26.450
who is the
director/choreographer

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:27.470
of the show.

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:31.670
We've all worked with him
many times or only on this,

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:35.120
but he pretty much
got in touch with us

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:37.810
and wanted us to be
a part of it, which

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:40.454
is very lucky and
fortunate for all of us.

00:06:40.454 --> 00:06:42.620
And we've all been involved
with it for a long time.

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:45.410
We've been working on this for
a considerable amount of time.

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:49.730
And all of it joyous
and fantastic, so it

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:52.730
was an easy audition process.

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:54.740
MATT MAGER: So another
question quick first.

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:00.850
We're going to edit that out.

your names and like what part

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:08.490

who is a former actor,

00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:25.336

veteran, an old gay
actor, so real stretch.

00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:42.538

who's just trying really
hard to come out, but can't.

00:07:53.075 --> 00:07:54.700

ANGIE SCHWORER:
Hi, Angie Schworer.

00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:14.860

girl with a heart of gold.

00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:15.810
COURTENAY COLLINS: Hi.

00:08:15.810 --> 00:08:19.050
I'm Courtenay Collins
and I play Mrs. Greene--

00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:22.230
she does not have a
first name, Mrs.--

00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:27.450
who is the president
of the PTA in Indiana,

00:08:27.450 --> 00:08:29.730
and I'm also Izzy's
mother and I'm

00:08:29.730 --> 00:08:32.050
trying to keep her in the can.

00:08:32.050 --> 00:08:33.610
CHAD BEGUELIN: Oh, I've got one.

00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:34.679
I'm Chad Beguelin.

00:08:34.679 --> 00:08:36.990
I co-wrote the book,
which is the script,

00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:39.030
and I wrote the
lyrics to the songs.

00:08:39.030 --> 00:08:40.740
MATTHEW SKLAR:
I'm Matthew Sklar.

00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:41.942
I wrote the music.

00:08:41.942 --> 00:08:42.900
BETH LEAVEL: That's it?

00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:43.941
MATTHEW SKLAR: That's it.

00:08:43.941 --> 00:08:45.490
That's all I did.

00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:47.280
BETH LEAVEL: I'm Beth Leavel.

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:50.760
I play diva Dee
Dee Allen, who has

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:56.498
won two Tony awards that she
carries with her at all times.

00:08:56.498 --> 00:08:57.850
MATT MAGER: They make a cameo.

00:08:57.850 --> 00:09:01.280
It's really great.

00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:04.610
So Matthew and
Chad specifically,

00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:08.390
how do you approach an
original work like this?

00:09:08.390 --> 00:09:10.970
Some of your previous
work is really awesome,

00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:14.090
but they're based on
properties that exist already.

00:09:14.090 --> 00:09:17.266
How did you formulate this show?

00:09:17.266 --> 00:09:19.990
CHAD BEGUELIN: Well there
was a lot of trial and error.

00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:22.620
The idea came from
Jack Viertel, and he

00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:24.750
was working with our
director, Casey, and he said,

00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:26.160
I have this idea for a show.

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:29.370
And you know, thankfully he
suggested us to write it.

00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:32.940
And we got together with
Casey and Bob Martin, who's

00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:35.550
not here today but co-wrote
the script with me,

00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:37.680
and there was just a
lot of brainstorming.

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:40.412
And you know, we did
a million workshops

00:09:40.412 --> 00:09:41.370
and a million readings.

00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:44.380
And you know, the show used to--

00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:46.950
a very early version
of the show opened

00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:51.730
with these three characters all
in different horrible musicals.

00:09:51.730 --> 00:09:52.700
So Beth was in--

00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:54.658
BETH LEAVEL: Tell them
which ones they were in.

00:09:54.658 --> 00:09:57.675
CHAD BEGUELIN: Beth was
in "Goonies" the musical.

00:09:57.675 --> 00:09:59.490
MATTHEW SKLAR: "Forrest
Gump" the musical.

00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:02.010
CHAD BEGUELIN: And "Long
Day's Journey into Night"

00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:04.050
the musical.

00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:07.560
And they all ended
with confetti cannons.

00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:09.120
Even "Journey," which was just--

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:09.970
MATTHEW SKLAR: At
the top of the show,

00:10:09.970 --> 00:10:11.761
we just blasted the
audience with confetti.

00:10:11.761 --> 00:10:14.430
CHAD BEGUELIN: Just everybody
in "Long Day's Night" go,

00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:15.555
journey, and then confetti.

00:10:15.555 --> 00:10:16.260
MATTHEW SKLAR: Yeah.

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:17.190
We thought it was hilarious.

00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:18.250
MATT MAGER: That's
another musical.

00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:19.333
CHAD BEGUELIN: Yeah, yeah.

00:10:19.333 --> 00:10:20.385
MATTHEW SKLAR: Exactly.

00:10:20.385 --> 00:10:23.010
CHAD BEGUELIN: Yeah, so it
was a lot of stuff like that.

00:10:23.010 --> 00:10:25.320
We'd try it and we'd go,
OK, well that doesn't work.

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:28.290
Or you know, it
was a lot of just--

00:10:28.290 --> 00:10:31.560
and definitely with
this caliber of a cast,

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:35.910
you know, getting their
input has been crucial.

00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:38.220
So it was great
to sort of design

00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:39.840
these roles for these actors.

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:40.710
MATTHEW SKLAR: Yeah.

00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:43.310
When we first started,
we spent a couple

00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:45.600
of years outlining
and just trying

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:48.360
to figure out where songs would
go and how they would function.

00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:50.970
And we were probably
at it for two years

00:10:50.970 --> 00:10:54.390
before we even kind of invited
you guys into the process.

00:10:54.390 --> 00:10:59.730
We had you all in
mind for it, but it

00:10:59.730 --> 00:11:01.680
was a really lengthy process.

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:04.830
From the idea to
opening on Broadway

00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:08.370
was about eight years,
a really long time.

00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:11.490
And the one character
that changed the most--

00:11:11.490 --> 00:11:15.492
we used to have, instead of
Angie's character, we had--

00:11:15.492 --> 00:11:16.950
I forget what her
name was, but she

00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:19.620
was an understudy to
Elphaba, and she never

00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:21.869
got to go on she was
always slightly green.

00:11:21.869 --> 00:11:23.660
CHAD BEGUELIN: Couldn't
get the makeup off.

00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:24.540
MATTHEW SKLAR: Yeah, she
couldn't get the makeup off.

00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:25.860
She was allergic
to it or something.

00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:27.359
But we thought it
was kind of campy,

00:11:27.359 --> 00:11:29.710
and then we were meeting
one day and Casey said,

00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:32.730
what if it's like a
showgirl like Angie?

00:11:32.730 --> 00:11:34.290
And we said, yeah like Angie.

00:11:34.290 --> 00:11:37.172
So we just wrote it for
Angie, which I love.

00:11:37.172 --> 00:11:39.630
ANGIE SCHWORER: I'm glad it
was Roxie Hart and not Elphaba,

00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:40.776
because that wouldn't be me.

00:11:40.776 --> 00:11:42.317
MATTHEW SKLAR: It
was the right move.

00:11:42.317 --> 00:11:44.160
It was the right move.

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:46.900
MATT MAGER: So that's awesome.

00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:49.460
I'm glad that you
didn't have to be green.

00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:50.340
I hear it's not easy.

00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:56.130
I couldn't help myself.

00:11:56.130 --> 00:11:59.850
But speaking of Casey,
you know, he directs

00:11:59.850 --> 00:12:01.950
and he choreographs,
which for those

00:12:01.950 --> 00:12:03.990
of you who aren't
musical theater fans,

00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:05.290
that's a big deal.

00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:09.240
And that's a different style
of direction and choreography.

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:13.870
How is it working with
a director/choreographer

00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:18.300
versus the directing and
the choreography separate.

00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:21.920
Does that really
change it for you?

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:24.370
BROOKS ASHMANSKAS: Yeah.

00:12:24.370 --> 00:12:26.770
I think it becomes
just much more focused.

00:12:26.770 --> 00:12:29.320
Everything that
happens in the show

00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:32.326
is basically coming from not
just the mind of the writers,

00:12:32.326 --> 00:12:34.700
but then when it's filtered
through one person as opposed

00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:35.710
to two--

00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:39.250
musicals are very, very
collaborative events,

00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:42.550
I think the most collaborative
art form there is.

00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:45.500
And so that can
be an opportunity,

00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:47.060
but it can also be a challenge.

00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:49.120
And so that's one less
challenge taken away,

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:50.920
so you just have one
person instead of two.

00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:52.336
CAITLIN KINNUNEN:
It automatically

00:12:52.336 --> 00:12:56.260
becomes such a cohesive piece
instead of like bits and pieces

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:57.440
trying to work together.

00:12:57.440 --> 00:12:58.795
It's just streamlined.

00:12:58.795 --> 00:13:01.774
BETH LEAVEL: And I also
think it makes it seamless.

00:13:01.774 --> 00:13:03.190
Because yes, there's
choreography,

00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:05.510
but when you have someone
with the same vocabulary,

00:13:05.510 --> 00:13:07.210
it just is seamless
and you can't really

00:13:07.210 --> 00:13:09.400
tell where one ends
and one begins.

00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:13.960
It's the same language and
Casey's so brilliant with that,

00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:15.970
so it makes our job easier.

00:13:15.970 --> 00:13:18.790
MATT MAGER: And I'm thinking
of very specific points

00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:23.500
in the plot where you have,
basically, two scenes happening

00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:26.080
at once where there's
dancing and there's acting,

00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:28.619
and it's pretty amazing.

00:13:28.619 --> 00:13:30.910
CHRISTOPHER SIEBER: That was
actually more challenging,

00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:33.850
because we were trying to make
that work and the audience

00:13:33.850 --> 00:13:34.630
wasn't getting it.

00:13:34.630 --> 00:13:38.770
But Casey was able
to fine tune it

00:13:38.770 --> 00:13:40.870
and it was clearly
in different places

00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:43.000
but were still in the same room.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.100
That was brilliantly
done by Casey Nicholaw.

00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:46.110
Yeah.

00:13:46.110 --> 00:13:49.900
MATT MAGER: And I noticed it,
and I said, this is smart.

00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:51.730
Speaking of smart--

00:13:51.730 --> 00:13:53.770
BROOKS ASHMANSKAS: Thank you.

00:13:53.770 --> 00:13:56.890
MATT MAGER: All of you.

00:13:56.890 --> 00:14:00.100
"Unruly Heart,"
specifically, is a song

00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:01.270
you sing in the second act.

00:14:01.270 --> 00:14:08.500
It is such a great song for
Emma, but it's written by Emma.

00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:11.770
And writing a song that
feels authentically written

00:14:11.770 --> 00:14:16.535
by a teenager when you're
not, if I can assume.

00:14:16.535 --> 00:14:17.710
MATTHEW SKLAR: Hey, come on.

00:14:17.710 --> 00:14:20.900
MATT MAGER: You seem like
you're maybe in your early 20s.

00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:22.480
We're not ageist here.

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:25.700
Everyone here is
in their early 20s.

00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:27.890
Just kidding.

00:14:27.890 --> 00:14:32.425
But how did you go about
writing that piece specifically?

00:14:32.425 --> 00:14:35.610
MATTHEW SKLAR: Well that
song was music first.

00:14:35.610 --> 00:14:39.130
I had that tune living in
me for actually a long time,

00:14:39.130 --> 00:14:41.420
and I didn't know
what to use it for.

00:14:41.420 --> 00:14:45.490
And when this moment
came up in the plot--

00:14:45.490 --> 00:14:47.800
and it took years
to figure out what

00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:51.310
that moment was going to
be when Emma kind of comes

00:14:51.310 --> 00:14:53.230
into her own.

00:14:53.230 --> 00:14:56.270
It felt like, oh, I
can use this tune.

00:14:56.270 --> 00:15:00.250
And then I sent a
recording of it to Chad,

00:15:00.250 --> 00:15:02.980
and he wrote this
beautiful lyric.

00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:06.650
And it's morphed over the years.

00:15:06.650 --> 00:15:10.240
It used to really just be Emma,
and then we added the kids

00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:13.450
to it, and then in our last
workshop which was just

00:15:13.450 --> 00:15:18.730
in January, February,
Casey said, I

00:15:18.730 --> 00:15:21.580
want the kids to just soar more.

00:15:21.580 --> 00:15:24.426
And he was really
on me about that,

00:15:24.426 --> 00:15:26.050
because we used to
end it very quietly.

00:15:26.050 --> 00:15:28.690
And it worked in Atlanta and our
out of town a couple of years

00:15:28.690 --> 00:15:31.850
ago, but he said, I think
we can get more out of it.

00:15:31.850 --> 00:15:35.464
And so went downstairs, and
took three shots at it, and then

00:15:35.464 --> 00:15:36.880
the third, he was
like, that's it.

00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:38.350
And then we taught it to
everybody and everybody

00:15:38.350 --> 00:15:39.626
was a crying mess.

00:15:39.626 --> 00:15:42.490
CAITLIN KINNUNEN: And everyone's
a crying mess every single day.

00:15:42.490 --> 00:15:43.450
MATTHEW SKLAR: It
feels like that, yeah.

00:15:43.450 --> 00:15:43.570
Me included.

00:15:43.570 --> 00:15:44.650
MATT MAGER: And the
audience as well.

00:15:44.650 --> 00:15:46.330
Definitely everyone
is a crying mess.

00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:47.500
CAITLIN KINNUNEN: There's
always like a pause

00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:49.570
before people start
clapping, that you just hear

00:15:49.570 --> 00:15:53.470
the [SNIFFLING] every night.

00:15:53.470 --> 00:15:54.805
MATT MAGER: Wear long sleeves.

00:15:59.710 --> 00:16:02.620
Speaking of crying messes,
for those of you who

00:16:02.620 --> 00:16:04.660
were watching the
Macy's Thanksgiving Day

00:16:04.660 --> 00:16:09.850
Parade from home, not when it
was 20 degrees, first of all,

00:16:09.850 --> 00:16:10.640
wow.

00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:11.720
MATTHEW SKLAR: Yeah.

00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:12.920
God bless you guys.

00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:13.760
MATT MAGER: Yeah.

00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:14.260
Good work.

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:15.280
CHRISTOPHER SIEBER:
It was 7 degrees.

00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:16.520
MATT MAGER: It was.

00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:21.850
And it was also the first LGBT
kiss at the Macy's Thanksgiving

00:16:21.850 --> 00:16:22.810
Day Parade.

00:16:22.810 --> 00:16:25.171
About damn time.

00:16:25.171 --> 00:16:25.670
Good work.

00:16:29.050 --> 00:16:34.400
So it's been a week, and there
has been buzz about that.

00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:36.160
How have you all received that?

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:40.236
I mean, don't read the comments,
but how have you received that?

00:16:40.236 --> 00:16:42.560
CHRISTOPHER SIEBER:
It's been funny to hear

00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:49.790
from the people opposing any
like goodness, love, and light.

00:16:49.790 --> 00:16:52.940
The comments that they're
making about two people who just

00:16:52.940 --> 00:16:54.629
happen to love
each other kissing

00:16:54.629 --> 00:16:56.670
on a national television,
they thought, you know,

00:16:56.670 --> 00:16:58.530
our children's
innocence is broken.

00:16:58.530 --> 00:17:01.340
And the funny thing,
reading comments like that,

00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:03.680
you kind of go, well, all right.

00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:05.750
You kind of just
missed the entire point

00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:07.040
of the entire thing.

00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:13.430
But also, seeing everybody
from around the world defending

00:17:13.430 --> 00:17:15.800
was like, your heart just
got bigger and bigger.

00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:18.140
Because there were
more people jumping

00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:20.480
on those haters
than anything I've

00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:24.877
ever seen defending and making
points about gun control

00:17:24.877 --> 00:17:26.960
and all these other things
which were quite valid,

00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:29.310
but it was so nice to
see so many people, just

00:17:29.310 --> 00:17:32.360
the message of love that
we have, holding on to that

00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:35.745
and preaching that out
rather than any kind of hate.

00:17:35.745 --> 00:17:38.840
ISABELLE MCCALLA: And for me,
what was the most rewarding

00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:41.240
was that I kept getting
messages from teenagers

00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:42.140
across the country.

00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:43.210
CHRISTOPHER SIEBER:
Yeah, all of us.

00:17:43.210 --> 00:17:44.330
ISABELLE MCCALLA: Yeah.

00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:48.370
We all did, about how either
they were still in the closet,

00:17:48.370 --> 00:17:50.440
just had recently come
out, identify as bi,

00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:54.620
identify as gay, and how
it made them feel validated

00:17:54.620 --> 00:17:57.351
and just human to be like that.

00:17:57.351 --> 00:17:58.850
There are so many
families that look

00:17:58.850 --> 00:18:01.672
like that around the world, and
to say it's not a family show

00:18:01.672 --> 00:18:03.380
is actually not true
because there are so

00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:04.379
many families like that.

00:18:04.379 --> 00:18:08.030
And hearing those kids
feel inspired by it

00:18:08.030 --> 00:18:09.830
and feel emboldened
to be themselves

00:18:09.830 --> 00:18:13.105
was kind of the
best result of it.

00:18:13.105 --> 00:18:15.145
MATT MAGER: That's
really awesome to hear,

00:18:15.145 --> 00:18:17.145
because sometimes it goes
the opposite direction

00:18:17.145 --> 00:18:19.670
and it's like wow,
maybe we overstepped.

00:18:19.670 --> 00:18:24.040
But queer representation and
representation in general

00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:26.800
has become a bigger and bigger
thing in Broadway, a bigger

00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:28.930
a bigger thing and movies.

00:18:28.930 --> 00:18:31.300
"Head Over Heels"
has a trans character

00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:33.580
played by a trans actor.

00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:38.110
The Donna Summer musical has
an almost entirely female cast,

00:18:38.110 --> 00:18:41.830
and various musicals are using
sign language interpreters

00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:43.855
and sign language
as part of the show.

00:18:46.690 --> 00:18:49.045
Writing a show
that is kind of, I

00:18:49.045 --> 00:18:52.060
don't want to say pushing an
agenda, but pushing an agenda,

00:18:52.060 --> 00:18:53.020
is also hard.

00:18:56.670 --> 00:18:59.020
What, for those
of you who may be

00:18:59.020 --> 00:19:01.712
more veteran in the industry,
not that you're not--

00:19:01.712 --> 00:19:02.920
CHRISTOPHER SIEBER: The olds.

00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:04.191
You can call us the olds.

00:19:04.191 --> 00:19:05.565
BROOKS ASHMANSKAS:
Speak up, boy.

00:19:05.565 --> 00:19:06.606
CHRISTOPHER SIEBER: What?

00:19:06.606 --> 00:19:07.510
Who?

00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:09.170
Where am I?

00:19:09.170 --> 00:19:15.940
MATT MAGER: So for those of you
who have been here for a while,

00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:21.634
how has acting and performing
changed over the time

00:19:21.634 --> 00:19:22.550
that you've been here.

00:19:22.550 --> 00:19:28.480
I know you actually came out
in the process of your career,

00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:32.120
Christopher, and do you feel
like that would be different

00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:32.620
now?

00:19:32.620 --> 00:19:33.630
Like do people even
have to anymore?

00:19:33.630 --> 00:19:35.213
CHRISTOPHER SIEBER:
Well what happened

00:19:35.213 --> 00:19:37.960
was, I was always gay and
everybody knew, so coming out

00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:40.510
was like, and?

00:19:40.510 --> 00:19:44.639
But you know, I did my very
first situational comedy on ABC

00:19:44.639 --> 00:19:46.180
called "Two of a
Kind" where I played

00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:48.710
the Olsens' dad, and they--

00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:50.070
thank you.

00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:50.660
Thank you.

00:19:50.660 --> 00:19:51.611
Thank you so much.

00:19:51.611 --> 00:19:52.110
No, go on.

00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:54.190
MATT MAGER: It also gets
a cameo in the show.

00:19:54.190 --> 00:19:55.330
CHRISTOPHER SIEBER: Yes.

00:19:55.330 --> 00:19:57.580
But I played
professor Kevin Burke.

00:19:57.580 --> 00:20:01.250
I had two daughters,
and they wanted to--

00:20:01.250 --> 00:20:04.360
our executive
producer said, hey.

00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:06.430
Do you want us to
fly your wife out?

00:20:06.430 --> 00:20:09.470
And I said, oh.

00:20:09.470 --> 00:20:11.410
Well, let's go talk
in your office.

00:20:11.410 --> 00:20:13.120
So I said, you know,
I don't have a wife.

00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:14.561
I have a partner.

00:20:14.561 --> 00:20:16.060
And they were like,
oh, yeah, great.

00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:17.050
I don't know how
to deal with this.

00:20:17.050 --> 00:20:18.070
I mean, it's Hollywood.

00:20:18.070 --> 00:20:19.180
It's different.

00:20:19.180 --> 00:20:22.660
Theater is like whatever,
but television, you know,

00:20:22.660 --> 00:20:25.090
there's so many
closeted people still.

00:20:25.090 --> 00:20:27.340
But I said, I don't
know how to handle this.

00:20:27.340 --> 00:20:29.440
I don't care, but
it's about the show.

00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:30.350
It's not about me.

00:20:30.350 --> 00:20:32.440
So they were like, if you
make a big deal out of,

00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:33.190
it'll be a big deal.

00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:34.148
If you don't, it won't.

00:20:34.148 --> 00:20:36.046
So that's what we did.

00:20:36.046 --> 00:20:37.930
But the second sitcom,
"It's All Relative"

00:20:37.930 --> 00:20:39.971
where John Benjamin Hickey
and I played partners,

00:20:39.971 --> 00:20:45.460
well-heeled men with a daughter
at Harvard, we kind of just

00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:46.300
said, well yeah.

00:20:46.300 --> 00:20:50.560
I mean, we're two gay actors
playing gay men, let's go out

00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:51.890
and say hi, everybody.

00:20:51.890 --> 00:20:52.690
Yeah.

00:20:52.690 --> 00:20:55.630
And again, it was kind
of like, whatever.

00:20:55.630 --> 00:20:57.940
You know, it was
like, yeah, we know.

00:20:57.940 --> 00:20:59.140
We know.

00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:00.490
So it wasn't a problem.

00:21:00.490 --> 00:21:05.980
Now though, I mean, over
the course of the years,

00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:08.854
like Izzy was saying, you
see kids at our stage door

00:21:08.854 --> 00:21:11.020
wanting autographs and there
are tears in their eyes

00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:14.590
because they see themselves
finally represented.

00:21:14.590 --> 00:21:18.550
And they are so moved and
they're shaking with tears just

00:21:18.550 --> 00:21:20.620
from seeing the show.

00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:22.070
You know, I am here.

00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:22.720
I am here.

00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:24.730
And then that's
what I see when--

00:21:24.730 --> 00:21:27.630
like somebody saw me, finally.

00:21:27.630 --> 00:21:29.630
But then they're coming
out younger and younger,

00:21:29.630 --> 00:21:31.420
which is so great,
which is fantastic,

00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:34.060
because there's a
lot of people that

00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:37.510
just have the courage
enough to be themselves.

00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:38.010
Wow.

00:21:38.010 --> 00:21:39.130
That was a long-winded answer.

00:21:39.130 --> 00:21:39.630
Sorry.

00:21:39.630 --> 00:21:42.140
Sorry.

00:21:42.140 --> 00:21:44.807
BROOKS ASHMANSKAS: You know,
I would also say that the--

00:21:44.807 --> 00:21:46.390
CHRISTOPHER SIEBER:
Brooks is gay too.

00:21:46.390 --> 00:21:47.050
Brooks is gay.

00:21:47.050 --> 00:21:47.130
BROOKS ASHMANSKAS: No, no.

00:21:47.130 --> 00:21:47.900
God no.

00:21:47.900 --> 00:21:49.428
I like the ladies.

00:21:49.428 --> 00:21:51.300
MATT MAGER: We don't
want to encourage

00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:51.650
anyone outing someone else.

00:21:51.650 --> 00:21:53.470
BROOKS ASHMANSKAS:
You know, you said

00:21:53.470 --> 00:21:56.530
that this is pushing an
agenda, and I would deeply

00:21:56.530 --> 00:21:57.880
disagree with you on that.

00:21:57.880 --> 00:22:02.020
And not in a mean way, just
to say what the theater does

00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:07.600
is presents, you know,
as a mirror to life.

00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:08.230
Right?

00:22:08.230 --> 00:22:14.670
And so agendas are attached to
things or tagged onto things.

00:22:14.670 --> 00:22:16.810
And some of them are
welcome, you know.

00:22:16.810 --> 00:22:19.140
Obviously all the good
news about love is love

00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:21.340
and all of that stuff
is a welcome agenda

00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:22.637
that can be tagged onto this.

00:22:22.637 --> 00:22:24.220
There are unwelcome
ones as well as we

00:22:24.220 --> 00:22:26.410
were talking about the
Macy's thing with some people

00:22:26.410 --> 00:22:28.090
not really loving that.

00:22:28.090 --> 00:22:29.460
And you know what?

00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:30.490
OK.

00:22:30.490 --> 00:22:34.120
But that's what's so beautiful
about this show in particular

00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:40.220
and why I bring this up,
is that it doesn't judge,

00:22:40.220 --> 00:22:43.320
or it sends up
judgment, sends up

00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:47.730
our leftist judgments
about small town America

00:22:47.730 --> 00:22:48.870
and vise versa.

00:22:48.870 --> 00:22:53.730
And it lets the audience, you
know, have their own agenda

00:22:53.730 --> 00:22:56.100
about it or not, but
hopefully just to give them

00:22:56.100 --> 00:22:59.231
just a little taste of light.

00:22:59.231 --> 00:22:59.730
You know.

00:22:59.730 --> 00:23:02.220
That's what this show does
beautifully, and it's funny.

00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:04.290
BETH LEAVEL: And it's funny.

00:23:04.290 --> 00:23:05.730
I just have to
say that it is one

00:23:05.730 --> 00:23:10.830
of the best musicals in my
94 years in show business.

00:23:10.830 --> 00:23:17.640
It is one of the most satisfying
pieces of theater, if not--

00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:18.490
I will say it.

00:23:18.490 --> 00:23:20.265
It is the greatest
show I've ever done.

00:23:20.265 --> 00:23:21.390
CHRISTOPHER SIEBER: Me too.

00:23:21.390 --> 00:23:22.973
BETH LEAVEL: It
really is, and I think

00:23:22.973 --> 00:23:25.390
it's crafted so beautifully.

00:23:25.390 --> 00:23:27.030
What you guys have written is--

00:23:27.030 --> 00:23:28.110
I think, oh my gosh.

00:23:28.110 --> 00:23:29.230
It's just the greatest.

00:23:29.230 --> 00:23:32.340
Wait until you hear
these tunes wrapped up

00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:38.380
in this whole story about
love, listening, tolerance,

00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:40.500
entertainment.

00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:43.170
People have-- and I'm told
this constantly-- have never

00:23:43.170 --> 00:23:47.730
laughed so hard at a musical in
their life, and then at the end

00:23:47.730 --> 00:23:49.680
go, oh my gosh.

00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:51.850
I'm crying out of joy.

00:23:51.850 --> 00:23:57.570
I mean, the joy that comes
from this show is unbelievable.

00:23:57.570 --> 00:24:01.980
And the audience at the
end, every single show,

00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:03.180
we have a standing--

00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:06.330
I feel like we're
celebrating with the audience

00:24:06.330 --> 00:24:09.610
the joyous collaboration that
we have all just experienced.

00:24:09.610 --> 00:24:11.790
And that is why I'm in theater.

00:24:11.790 --> 00:24:12.710
Thank you.

00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:14.694
MATTHEW SKLAR: Well said.

00:24:14.694 --> 00:24:15.610
MATT MAGER: Thank you.

00:24:21.150 --> 00:24:24.330
And I appreciate that.

00:24:24.330 --> 00:24:26.710
That is a really
great correction,

00:24:26.710 --> 00:24:30.570
because I have another
question specifically for you

00:24:30.570 --> 00:24:35.490
because you play Mrs.
Greene without a first name.

00:24:35.490 --> 00:24:40.530
And I noticed that, you know,
she doesn't get a redemption.

00:24:40.530 --> 00:24:47.750
She gets a, we'll talk later,
and that was really honest.

00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:53.140
And it didn't answer the
question to your mind.

00:24:53.140 --> 00:24:58.130
It didn't solve
the problem, but it

00:24:58.130 --> 00:25:02.030
shows that everybody is a little
bit of an outsider in the show.

00:25:02.030 --> 00:25:04.100
Everyone is bringing
something that's

00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:10.170
a little outside of
the norm in some way.

00:25:10.170 --> 00:25:11.802
Now you're also
from Atlanta, right?

00:25:11.802 --> 00:25:12.510
BETH LEAVEL: Yes.

00:25:12.510 --> 00:25:13.710
MATT MAGER: You're
not from New York.

00:25:13.710 --> 00:25:14.670
BETH LEAVEL: No.

00:25:14.670 --> 00:25:17.640
MATT MAGER: You're dealing in
your day to day life in Atlanta

00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:22.280
with people that are probably
not all New York liberal types,

00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:23.540
and you know these characters.

00:25:23.540 --> 00:25:25.490
You know this
person I'm guessing.

00:25:25.490 --> 00:25:29.279
How is the process of
being in that character

00:25:29.279 --> 00:25:31.070
here, and I'm not going
to presume anything

00:25:31.070 --> 00:25:33.410
about your political [INAUDIBLE]
or anything like that,

00:25:33.410 --> 00:25:35.570
but I'm curious.

00:25:35.570 --> 00:25:38.640
How do you build that character?

00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:40.350
BETH LEAVEL: Well,
as a Republican-- no.

00:25:40.350 --> 00:25:42.550
I'm joking.

00:25:42.550 --> 00:25:43.050
No.

00:25:46.260 --> 00:25:47.690
No, that's not true actually.

00:25:47.690 --> 00:25:54.720
But the character has grown on
me and on all of us I think.

00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:56.760
The character has
morphed and changed,

00:25:56.760 --> 00:26:01.230
and these incredible
writers have really

00:26:01.230 --> 00:26:06.450
added a lot of depth and layers
to Mrs. Greene that maybe

00:26:06.450 --> 00:26:08.310
wasn't in the first
reading that I

00:26:08.310 --> 00:26:10.740
read two years ago in Atlanta.

00:26:10.740 --> 00:26:16.110
And I think what I've noticed
is that we've taken basically

00:26:16.110 --> 00:26:20.070
a lot of political
references out of the play.

00:26:20.070 --> 00:26:23.580
It's very sort of
party neutral, I

00:26:23.580 --> 00:26:27.010
would say, from
Mrs. Greene's side.

00:26:27.010 --> 00:26:29.400
So I always say that wherever
you are-- because I mean,

00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:30.930
we're playing to
New York audiences,

00:26:30.930 --> 00:26:32.250
but we're also playing
to middle America.

00:26:32.250 --> 00:26:34.791
We're playing to people who come
to the show from everywhere.

00:26:34.791 --> 00:26:37.800
So I think that wherever
people sit in the audience

00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:40.920
and from whatever side
of politics they sit on,

00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:42.570
they're going to see themselves.

00:26:42.570 --> 00:26:44.280
They're going to
laugh at themselves.

00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:49.520
They're going to maybe learn
something about themselves.

00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:51.210
I think it's a very--

00:26:51.210 --> 00:26:52.770
we celebrate everybody.

00:26:52.770 --> 00:26:56.940
We open our hearts to everybody,
and we represent small town

00:26:56.940 --> 00:27:02.820
America and in a very truthful
manner about people who

00:27:02.820 --> 00:27:04.152
are afraid of big government.

00:27:04.152 --> 00:27:06.360
And we're afraid of people
who are different from us,

00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:08.606
and in the end--

00:27:08.606 --> 00:27:10.230
and it's the same
with the New Yorkers.

00:27:10.230 --> 00:27:12.870
New Yorkers come
and they're so sure

00:27:12.870 --> 00:27:17.020
that their way of
tolerance in life is--

00:27:17.020 --> 00:27:18.780
they're going to
teach us compassion,

00:27:18.780 --> 00:27:23.137
these booger-eating, whatever
y'all say about the--

00:27:23.137 --> 00:27:24.720
CAITLIN KINNUNEN:
They don't say that.

00:27:27.855 --> 00:27:31.602
BETH LEAVEL: Cousin humping,
booger eating, spam eating.

00:27:31.602 --> 00:27:32.560
That's it, spam eating.

00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:34.630
Sorry.

00:27:34.630 --> 00:27:38.622
BROOKS ASHMANSKAS: You'd tell
us if you had a stroke, right?

00:27:38.622 --> 00:27:41.520
BETH LEAVEL: I would
be the last to know.

00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:44.040
But this is my favorite
part about playing

00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:47.370
Mrs. Greene, besides the
fact that she does not

00:27:47.370 --> 00:27:53.070
have a first name, is that I
have had so many stories shared

00:27:53.070 --> 00:27:59.250
with me from gay men and women
because it doesn't resolve,

00:27:59.250 --> 00:28:07.680
because Chad and Bob and Matt
have tried very hard to find

00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:11.430
a truthful story about a child
who is gay and a mother who

00:28:11.430 --> 00:28:13.830
doesn't want the
child to be gay.

00:28:13.830 --> 00:28:18.600
And the dialogue that happens
between parents and kids

00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:22.830
being who they are and the
parent not wanting that--

00:28:22.830 --> 00:28:28.140
is afraid, the fear of your
child not being like you

00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:30.450
and the fear of your child
not having an easy life.

00:28:30.450 --> 00:28:31.710
That's what they perceive.

00:28:31.710 --> 00:28:34.770
So the dialogue that happened,
people have come up to me

00:28:34.770 --> 00:28:36.990
and shared their
beautiful stories

00:28:36.990 --> 00:28:41.327
about their conversations
with their parents that

00:28:41.327 --> 00:28:43.410
are very similar to the
conversations that we have

00:28:43.410 --> 00:28:45.409
in the show and the things
that Mrs. Greene says

00:28:45.409 --> 00:28:46.860
to her daughter.

00:28:46.860 --> 00:28:49.500
And some of the
stories end happily.

00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:51.400
Most of them don't.

00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:56.610
And I carry those stories with
me every night in this play,

00:28:56.610 --> 00:29:00.955
so that's been a beautiful
sort of result of playing this.

00:29:00.955 --> 00:29:04.011
MATT MAGER: And I want to
give you a tiny little gift.

00:29:04.011 --> 00:29:06.010
I was hanging out with
some friends from Austin,

00:29:06.010 --> 00:29:10.230
Texas, that had come to the
show with their extended family,

00:29:10.230 --> 00:29:13.750
some of whom are a little
more on the conservative end.

00:29:13.750 --> 00:29:16.020
And I said, oh, I'm going
to interview the cast.

00:29:16.020 --> 00:29:20.940
And one of them said, oh, so my
stepfather came out of the show

00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:25.290
and said, there are some
things I need to rethink.

00:29:25.290 --> 00:29:26.490
And so thank you for that.

00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:32.720
You're doing really
solid work, all of you.

00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:34.710
So from the
community, thank you.

00:29:37.482 --> 00:29:40.242
MICHAEL POTTS: I mean,
I know it's a musical

00:29:40.242 --> 00:29:41.700
and we talk about
music, but I also

00:29:41.700 --> 00:29:44.220
wanted to thank the creative
team because they've

00:29:44.220 --> 00:29:46.390
taken such great care
of the book as well.

00:29:46.390 --> 00:29:49.260
They've put in the same
amount of compassion.

00:29:49.260 --> 00:29:52.920
Book scenes in a musical, mostly
in musicals, the book scenes

00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:53.580
get tossed.

00:29:53.580 --> 00:29:56.560
No one really cares, like
get to the next dance

00:29:56.560 --> 00:29:58.260
or the next song.

00:29:58.260 --> 00:30:03.270
But they have taken such
great care of the characters

00:30:03.270 --> 00:30:05.310
and of the story that
they want to tell

00:30:05.310 --> 00:30:06.550
even outside of the music.

00:30:06.550 --> 00:30:08.008
And I wanted to
thank you for that.

00:30:08.008 --> 00:30:10.055
That's pretty incredible
and rewarding.

00:30:10.055 --> 00:30:13.126
CHAD BEGUELIN: Bob thanks
you too from Canada.

00:30:13.126 --> 00:30:16.360
MATT MAGER: We've got some
questions from the audience,

00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:20.832
and I would love to open
up now for some of those.

00:30:20.832 --> 00:30:21.700
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:24.320
I've got a question
for the writer.

00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:26.560
I'm a hobbyist writer,
and I was wondering

00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:29.710
if you could give any advice
to what kind of pitfalls

00:30:29.710 --> 00:30:34.120
you kind of fell into and
what you would do differently

00:30:34.120 --> 00:30:37.315
to make it be maybe not eight
years but something shorter.

00:30:40.664 --> 00:30:41.950
CHAD BEGUELIN: Time travel.

00:30:44.470 --> 00:30:46.360
I think the best
advice I ever got

00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:49.190
was that it's got to be
bad before it can be good.

00:30:49.190 --> 00:30:52.300
And so when you write that
first song or you write

00:30:52.300 --> 00:30:54.820
that first draft or that first
scene, and then you go back

00:30:54.820 --> 00:30:56.920
and you're like,
oh, this is awful.

00:30:56.920 --> 00:30:58.480
That's part of the process.

00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:01.840
And it's so easy to just give
up and just say OK, well this

00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:04.930
is not working, where it's
really about rewriting

00:31:04.930 --> 00:31:06.370
and rewriting and rewriting.

00:31:06.370 --> 00:31:10.060
And I think another thing
that actually my therapist

00:31:10.060 --> 00:31:13.210
said to me a long
time ago, you know,

00:31:13.210 --> 00:31:15.730
I would get sort of a panic,
especially with lyrics

00:31:15.730 --> 00:31:18.640
when we needed a new lyric,
the sort of panic of like,

00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:19.330
oh can I do it?

00:31:19.330 --> 00:31:20.590
Can I do it?

00:31:20.590 --> 00:31:22.990
And she said, it sounds
like you're closing down

00:31:22.990 --> 00:31:24.440
when you should be opening up.

00:31:24.440 --> 00:31:25.910
And I thought, oh, OK.

00:31:25.910 --> 00:31:28.220
That's a really good
way to look at it.

00:31:28.220 --> 00:31:31.090
So I think that's the other
thing is that because there's

00:31:31.090 --> 00:31:36.490
so much pressure to sort
of trust the process

00:31:36.490 --> 00:31:40.570
and trust the collaborators
and know that it will come.

00:31:45.450 --> 00:31:46.720
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:49.526
So I saw some clips of the
Atlanta production online,

00:31:49.526 --> 00:31:51.400
which is how I first
found out about and fell

00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:52.930
in love with the show.

00:31:52.930 --> 00:31:56.260
And I noticed a few like
artistic and structural changes

00:31:56.260 --> 00:31:58.064
from that one to
this production,

00:31:58.064 --> 00:31:59.980
particularly like with
the song "You Happened"

00:31:59.980 --> 00:32:01.787
and a few other things.

00:32:01.787 --> 00:32:04.120
So I was wondering if you
could talk about the rewriting

00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:06.287
process and what
you had in mind,

00:32:06.287 --> 00:32:07.870
whether it was
feedback from audiences

00:32:07.870 --> 00:32:11.166
or changing geography
or anything.

00:32:11.166 --> 00:32:14.850
MATTHEW SKLAR: Well, with
"You Happened," in Atlanta,

00:32:14.850 --> 00:32:18.830
it was basically just a
duet for Emma and Alyssa.

00:32:18.830 --> 00:32:22.730
And what we found was that
it wasn't propelling anything

00:32:22.730 --> 00:32:24.100
forward.

00:32:24.100 --> 00:32:29.600
And then actually our producers,
Dori who's back there actually,

00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:33.110
told us about the phenomenon of
promposals that were happening

00:32:33.110 --> 00:32:35.660
in high schools across America.

00:32:35.660 --> 00:32:40.850
And we thought, maybe we can get
some straight promposals happen

00:32:40.850 --> 00:32:42.560
in that song, and
then we're going

00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:47.630
to join Emma and Alyssa where
they are talking about the prom

00:32:47.630 --> 00:32:48.800
but in private.

00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:52.160
So we're going from this big
celebration to these girls

00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:55.689
who have to hide their
love for each other,

00:32:55.689 --> 00:32:57.980
and that's kind of how we
started with this new version

00:32:57.980 --> 00:32:58.820
of the song.

00:32:58.820 --> 00:33:01.300
And we just feel
like it's just more--

00:33:01.300 --> 00:33:02.840
and we get to see them be happy.

00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:05.090
You know, everything in
Atlanta, the two girls,

00:33:05.090 --> 00:33:07.610
it was a lot of angst
a lot of the time.

00:33:07.610 --> 00:33:09.080
And we realized
that we really want

00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:11.960
to see them be happy
in Act One, so that

00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:15.490
was one of the big reasons
for that change as well.

00:33:15.490 --> 00:33:17.060
CHAD BEGUELIN: And we also--

00:33:17.060 --> 00:33:21.110
another big thing we focused
on was the town itself

00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:23.780
and making that more real.

00:33:23.780 --> 00:33:26.360
And I'm actually from a small
town in Southern Illinois,

00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:29.780
and all of the stuff Mr.
Hawkins says it's actually

00:33:29.780 --> 00:33:31.100
true of my hometown.

00:33:31.100 --> 00:33:32.360
We had a factory shut down.

00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:35.817
The prison's the only
place that employs anybody

00:33:35.817 --> 00:33:37.400
and it's hard to
even get a job there.

00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:41.750
I mean, really putting that
sort of reality into the show,

00:33:41.750 --> 00:33:43.097
I think, has helped ground it.

00:33:43.097 --> 00:33:43.930
MATTHEW SKLAR: Yeah.

00:33:43.930 --> 00:33:46.400
When we left Atlanta,
Casey said, here's

00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:48.090
one of the big things
I want to work on.

00:33:48.090 --> 00:33:50.215
I want to make sure we're
not Broadway people going

00:33:50.215 --> 00:33:51.290
to a Broadway town.

00:33:51.290 --> 00:33:54.240
I want Broadway people
to go to a real town,

00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:56.270
and that was really
the bulk of our work

00:33:56.270 --> 00:33:59.100
from Atlanta to New York.

00:33:59.100 --> 00:34:01.106
And I think it made
a huge difference.

00:34:01.106 --> 00:34:02.940
MATT MAGER: It
feels really real.

00:34:02.940 --> 00:34:05.760
It almost feels like there's
kind of three shows happening.

00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:08.580
There's the town show, there's
the Broadway folks show,

00:34:08.580 --> 00:34:10.750
and then there's the love story.

00:34:10.750 --> 00:34:11.394
It, really--

00:34:11.394 --> 00:34:12.420
MATTHEW SKLAR: And
you need all of them

00:34:12.420 --> 00:34:13.503
to balance each other out.

00:34:13.503 --> 00:34:15.300
MATT MAGER: And
they're very distinct.

00:34:15.300 --> 00:34:16.150
It's awesome.

00:34:16.150 --> 00:34:16.679
The work--

00:34:16.679 --> 00:34:18.512
BETH LEAVEL: The
groundedness of these guys.

00:34:18.512 --> 00:34:20.670
MATT MAGER: And the
intelligence of Mrs. Greene.

00:34:20.670 --> 00:34:23.280
Thank you for that,
because you don't want

00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:24.495
to show these people stupid.

00:34:24.495 --> 00:34:25.245
MATTHEW SKLAR: No.

00:34:25.245 --> 00:34:26.630
We never wanted to--

00:34:26.630 --> 00:34:28.170
we're not villainizing anybody.

00:34:28.170 --> 00:34:30.773
We're all real people, and
that was really important.

00:34:30.773 --> 00:34:31.719
MATT MAGER: Awesome.

00:34:31.719 --> 00:34:32.440
Thank you.

00:34:32.440 --> 00:34:33.229
Another question?

00:34:33.229 --> 00:34:34.020
AUDIENCE: Hi there.

00:34:34.020 --> 00:34:36.199
So I have two
questions about energy.

00:34:36.199 --> 00:34:41.830
So I saw the show with my
mom on October 29, which

00:34:41.830 --> 00:34:43.615
was this preview
during Monday and there

00:34:43.615 --> 00:34:45.239
were a bunch of other
performers there,

00:34:45.239 --> 00:34:48.469
so I felt like the energy was
extra high during that night,

00:34:48.469 --> 00:34:50.530
and I had never seen
anything like that.

00:34:50.530 --> 00:34:53.247
It was super fun.

00:34:53.247 --> 00:34:55.080
And so I'm just wondering--
this is actually

00:34:55.080 --> 00:34:57.496
a question from my mom and
then I have a separate question

00:34:57.496 --> 00:34:58.450
from myself.

00:34:58.450 --> 00:35:01.440
Hi, mom, when you
see this on YouTube.

00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:04.320
So my mom's question was,
how do you keep the energy up

00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:07.020
when you're performing the same
show and sometimes two times

00:35:07.020 --> 00:35:07.740
a day?

00:35:07.740 --> 00:35:13.560
And then my question is, during
preview versus officialness,

00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:15.420
how do you--

00:35:15.420 --> 00:35:18.210
like, I know you can't make
changes after the preview

00:35:18.210 --> 00:35:21.540
period ends, but how do
you sustain that and do

00:35:21.540 --> 00:35:24.680
you try harder during previews
or do you try harder after?

00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:27.684
Like, how do you try?

00:35:27.684 --> 00:35:28.725
CAITLIN KINNUNEN: Brooks?

00:35:31.410 --> 00:35:32.980
CHRISTOPHER SIEBER:
Well, go ahead.

00:35:32.980 --> 00:35:33.765
BETH LEAVEL: No, no, no.

00:35:33.765 --> 00:35:34.264
You go.

00:35:34.264 --> 00:35:36.730
CHRISTOPHER SIEBER: Well
during the preview process,

00:35:36.730 --> 00:35:39.570
we're still rehearsing
during the day upwards

00:35:39.570 --> 00:35:44.820
of like four or five hours
before that night's show

00:35:44.820 --> 00:35:45.480
in previews.

00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:48.900
And during that process, during
those four or five hours,

00:35:48.900 --> 00:35:50.810
we are making changes.

00:35:50.810 --> 00:35:51.730
We are lucky though.

00:35:51.730 --> 00:35:54.630
Because we have all done
so much work on this,

00:35:54.630 --> 00:35:59.160
there wasn't that much but there
was a lot, because there's just

00:35:59.160 --> 00:36:00.390
little details.

00:36:00.390 --> 00:36:02.430
Storytelling was like
the biggest tightening

00:36:02.430 --> 00:36:04.380
thing we did during
the preview section,

00:36:04.380 --> 00:36:07.110
but it's a long and
hard, tedious process

00:36:07.110 --> 00:36:09.339
to put on a big
huge Broadway show.

00:36:09.339 --> 00:36:10.630
There's a lot of tech elements.

00:36:10.630 --> 00:36:14.550
There's the costumes, the
wigs, the makeup, the sound,

00:36:14.550 --> 00:36:16.860
orchestra, everything, and
it's all coming together

00:36:16.860 --> 00:36:18.570
in one big room.

00:36:18.570 --> 00:36:22.860
And to get everyone together
and synchronize like watches

00:36:22.860 --> 00:36:24.810
almost, finally
getting together,

00:36:24.810 --> 00:36:26.700
it does take a
toll on your brain

00:36:26.700 --> 00:36:28.530
because there's
so much new stuff.

00:36:28.530 --> 00:36:30.510
And stuff that we had
been doing for six

00:36:30.510 --> 00:36:34.680
years all of a sudden just--
like my two numbers, "Love Thy

00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:36.330
Neighbor" and
"Acceptance," they're

00:36:36.330 --> 00:36:38.580
like, oh yeah, we're going
to change everything you've

00:36:38.580 --> 00:36:39.930
known for the last six years.

00:36:39.930 --> 00:36:42.836
And that happens, and your
brain is like, I don't even

00:36:42.836 --> 00:36:43.710
know what I'm saying.

00:36:43.710 --> 00:36:46.380
And then that night,
I said some weird line

00:36:46.380 --> 00:36:47.790
but it didn't matter.

00:36:47.790 --> 00:36:49.931
I think I went
bow-ba-bow-ba-bow.

00:36:49.931 --> 00:36:50.430
Yeah.

00:36:50.430 --> 00:36:51.750
That was the lyric
that night because I

00:36:51.750 --> 00:36:52.874
don't remember what it was.

00:36:56.460 --> 00:36:59.170
So yes, you're wiped out.

00:36:59.170 --> 00:37:03.240
You're absolutely wiped out,
like mentally, physically,

00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:04.200
vocally.

00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:05.430
And you get on stage and--

00:37:05.430 --> 00:37:07.219
I always call it doctor show.

00:37:07.219 --> 00:37:09.510
Some people call it doctor
greasepaint, doctor theater.

00:37:09.510 --> 00:37:11.760
You get onstage and
for some reason,

00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:16.020
there's something within us that
we become superheroes onstage.

00:37:16.020 --> 00:37:16.910
It's weird.

00:37:16.910 --> 00:37:19.410
I mean, if you have a cough,
you won't have a cough onstage.

00:37:19.410 --> 00:37:21.510
If you have hiccups backstage,
you won't have them onstage.

00:37:21.510 --> 00:37:23.968
If you're sneezing like that,
you will not have it onstage.

00:37:23.968 --> 00:37:26.750
It's the most bizarre thing.

00:37:26.750 --> 00:37:30.032
But yeah, so we're tired,
but that's just what happens.

00:37:30.032 --> 00:37:32.490
CAITLIN KINNUNEN: And I also
think there's something really

00:37:32.490 --> 00:37:35.850
uniquely special about this show
because we've all been working

00:37:35.850 --> 00:37:37.770
on it for so long
and we're all friends

00:37:37.770 --> 00:37:39.810
with each other in
real life and we all

00:37:39.810 --> 00:37:42.519
want to be telling this story.

00:37:42.519 --> 00:37:44.310
And so when we get
onstage with each other,

00:37:44.310 --> 00:37:46.530
there's like this instant
bond and this instant

00:37:46.530 --> 00:37:48.390
like, OK, we're
going to do this.

00:37:48.390 --> 00:37:49.320
Yes, we're exhausted.

00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:51.930
Yes, we've been doing this
forever and we're tired

00:37:51.930 --> 00:37:54.450
and we would like to be
in our beds, but like,

00:37:54.450 --> 00:37:57.050
we all get onstage,
and we just--

00:37:57.050 --> 00:37:57.870
you turn it on.

00:37:57.870 --> 00:38:01.020
And it's easy with these people
because we want to be there

00:38:01.020 --> 00:38:03.790
and we want to be
telling this story,

00:38:03.790 --> 00:38:06.735
and that makes a
huge difference.

00:38:06.735 --> 00:38:09.930
BETH LEAVEL: The audience from
the night that you were there,

00:38:09.930 --> 00:38:11.130
it was--

00:38:11.130 --> 00:38:12.870
I mean, we must have
added 10 minutes

00:38:12.870 --> 00:38:14.310
to the show with laughs.

00:38:14.310 --> 00:38:17.160
But our performances didn't
change from that night

00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:19.380
until the end of
last week when we

00:38:19.380 --> 00:38:22.500
had done eight shows in a row
and the Macy's Thanksgiving

00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:24.540
Parade in -40 degrees.

00:38:24.540 --> 00:38:28.740
So you know, because A,
we're professionals, B,

00:38:28.740 --> 00:38:34.200
that's my job and there are
20 million other people going,

00:38:34.200 --> 00:38:36.111
I'll do it if she can't.

00:38:36.111 --> 00:38:36.610
So--

00:38:36.610 --> 00:38:37.490
CHRISTOPHER SIEBER:
Big motivator.

00:38:37.490 --> 00:38:38.800
BETH LEAVEL: Yeah,
it is a big one.

00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:40.216
CHRISTOPHER SIEBER:
Big motivator.

00:38:40.216 --> 00:38:43.050
BETH LEAVEL: But I'm so proud
of the show that all of us

00:38:43.050 --> 00:38:47.139
give 150% every single show.

00:38:47.139 --> 00:38:48.180
And thank you for coming.

00:38:48.180 --> 00:38:50.071
Hi, mom.

00:38:50.071 --> 00:38:51.820
BROOKS ASHMANSKAS:
It's also the audience.

00:38:51.820 --> 00:38:54.120
I'm sorry, but you
know, that's why

00:38:54.120 --> 00:38:57.720
we love to do this and not other
things that are going to be

00:38:57.720 --> 00:38:59.010
taped or things like that.

00:38:59.010 --> 00:39:01.230
It's this that,
for me personally,

00:39:01.230 --> 00:39:03.480
I know it of these other
people as well, that's

00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:05.040
what gives me the energy.

00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:07.640
I have no energy
right this second.

00:39:07.640 --> 00:39:09.820
You know?

00:39:09.820 --> 00:39:15.450
I'm asleep because it's, you
know, not even what, 2:00 yet?

00:39:15.450 --> 00:39:16.950
This is ridiculously early.

00:39:16.950 --> 00:39:19.440
1:49 and 53 seconds.

00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:20.460
Google.

00:39:20.460 --> 00:39:21.990
But it really is the audience.

00:39:21.990 --> 00:39:25.342
If the audience is
not there with us,

00:39:25.342 --> 00:39:27.300
that becomes very difficult.
But with this show

00:39:27.300 --> 00:39:30.330
so far, it's been a real treat
because people seem to really

00:39:30.330 --> 00:39:32.290
climb on board and happily.

00:39:32.290 --> 00:39:35.824
I'm so glad about that,
so it's thanks to you.

00:39:35.824 --> 00:39:36.740
MATT MAGER: All right.

00:39:36.740 --> 00:39:38.810
So we've got time for
one more quick question

00:39:38.810 --> 00:39:41.750
and then we've got a couple more
performances so stick around.

00:39:41.750 --> 00:39:43.460
AUDIENCE: Thanks, everybody.

00:39:43.460 --> 00:39:45.787
I saw the show the Sunday
of the opening weekend

00:39:45.787 --> 00:39:47.370
and it was a really
great performance.

00:39:47.370 --> 00:39:48.203
I really enjoyed it.

00:39:48.203 --> 00:39:51.140
I kind of have another specific
question for the composer.

00:39:51.140 --> 00:39:55.340
Spoiler alert, there's a really
great number during the prom

00:39:55.340 --> 00:39:59.270
that you really wrote kind of
this great blend of a Broadway

00:39:59.270 --> 00:40:02.994
dance number that's mixed with
an EDM top 10 sounding number.

00:40:02.994 --> 00:40:04.910
Can you talk a little
bit about the challenges

00:40:04.910 --> 00:40:07.550
that you faced in sort of making
a sound that really encompassed

00:40:07.550 --> 00:40:08.133
both of those?

00:40:08.133 --> 00:40:12.100
MATTHEW SKLAR: Well,
the show really

00:40:12.100 --> 00:40:13.480
lives in two musical worlds.

00:40:13.480 --> 00:40:16.510
We have the Broadway sound,
and then we have the kid sound.

00:40:16.510 --> 00:40:25.210
And you know, what I had to do
is really simplify harmonically

00:40:25.210 --> 00:40:26.020
and lyrically.

00:40:26.020 --> 00:40:28.640
We had to kind of simplify
things for the kids.

00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:32.830
And part of it is, usually I
make my own demos when we're

00:40:32.830 --> 00:40:35.650
writing stuff and then
we get to give our work

00:40:35.650 --> 00:40:38.590
to these brilliant
arrangers and orchestrators

00:40:38.590 --> 00:40:39.634
and give them direction.

00:40:39.634 --> 00:40:41.050
So you know, I
have to give credit

00:40:41.050 --> 00:40:45.900
to them for helping make those
songs sound so authentic.

00:40:48.490 --> 00:40:52.200
But I think most
of it is listening

00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:57.590
to what people are listening
to now and dancing to.

00:40:57.590 --> 00:41:01.290
And it was also a challenge to
write in that particular song

00:41:01.290 --> 00:41:03.720
because it lives
in Brooks' world,

00:41:03.720 --> 00:41:06.900
and then we morph and then you
get thump, thump, thump, thump.

00:41:06.900 --> 00:41:12.180
It's the same tune, but
it's sort of flattened out

00:41:12.180 --> 00:41:13.500
and it's no--

00:41:13.500 --> 00:41:15.720
we don't swing the
eighth notes anymore,

00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:17.400
and then it becomes
a dance tune.

00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:23.730
So a lot of it is arrangement,
but in the construction of it,

00:41:23.730 --> 00:41:27.570
just making sure that you have a
melody and chord structure that

00:41:27.570 --> 00:41:28.860
can live in both worlds.

00:41:28.860 --> 00:41:31.430
And I hope I answered
your question.

00:41:31.430 --> 00:41:32.370
That's basically it.

00:41:32.370 --> 00:41:34.935
Just a lot of listening,
a lot of listening.

00:41:34.935 --> 00:41:35.935
BETH LEAVEL: What's EDM?

00:41:35.935 --> 00:41:36.687
Sorry.

00:41:36.687 --> 00:41:38.270
MATTHEW SKLAR:
Electronic dance music.

00:41:38.270 --> 00:41:39.515
BETH LEAVEL: I knew that.

00:41:39.515 --> 00:41:41.848
CHRISTOPHER SIEBER: It's what
the kids are [INAUDIBLE]..

00:41:41.848 --> 00:41:45.420
BROOKS ASHMANSKAS: I was like,
erectile dysfunction man.

00:41:47.462 --> 00:41:49.420
MATT MAGER: I think that's
a different musical.

00:41:49.420 --> 00:41:50.557
CAITLIN KINNUNEN: Go
back to sleep, Brooks.

00:41:50.557 --> 00:41:51.750
Go back to sleep.

00:41:51.750 --> 00:41:54.220
BROOKS ASHMANSKAS: I'm here.

00:41:54.220 --> 00:41:55.620
MATT MAGER: Yes, you are.

00:41:55.620 --> 00:41:59.400
And you have a mic in your hand
and we have a couple more songs

00:41:59.400 --> 00:42:02.010
that we're going to
hear from the cast.

00:42:02.010 --> 00:42:06.780
We have one from Brooks
and one from Beth.

00:42:06.780 --> 00:42:08.812
"The Prom" is an
excellent musical.

00:42:08.812 --> 00:42:10.020
I want everyone to go see it.

00:42:10.020 --> 00:42:10.740
BROOKS ASHMANSKAS:
Thank you so much.

00:42:10.740 --> 00:42:11.805
ANGIE SCHWORER: Thanks
for having us, Google.

00:42:11.805 --> 00:42:13.013
BROOKS ASHMANSKAS: Thank you.

00:42:18.982 --> 00:42:21.311
CHAD BEGUELIN: Just so
you know what's going on,

00:42:21.311 --> 00:42:23.060
this song is called
"The Lady's Improving"

00:42:23.060 --> 00:42:26.690
and Beth's character-- it
was the song that she sang

00:42:26.690 --> 00:42:27.565
many-- well not many.

00:42:27.565 --> 00:42:28.565
BETH LEAVEL: Yes it was.

00:42:28.565 --> 00:42:29.660
It was 20 years ago.

00:42:29.660 --> 00:42:32.720
CHAD BEGUELIN: OK, a long time
ago, and it made her a star.

00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:34.580
And so the principal,
Mr. Hawkins,

00:42:34.580 --> 00:42:37.250
is a big huge fan
of hers and he keeps

00:42:37.250 --> 00:42:39.945
begging her to sing the song.

00:42:39.945 --> 00:42:41.570
When he finds out
that she's just there

00:42:41.570 --> 00:42:43.970
to use him for publicity,
he's furious at her,

00:42:43.970 --> 00:42:49.014
so to make it up to him, she
performs a song in his office.

00:42:49.014 --> 00:42:50.180
BETH LEAVEL: You're welcome.

00:43:01.092 --> 00:43:03.982

00:45:28.396 --> 00:45:32.364
[APPLAUSE]

00:45:41.691 --> 00:45:43.440
CHAD BEGUELIN: And so
for this final song,

00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:46.410
Barry reveals
earlier in the show

00:45:46.410 --> 00:45:50.670
that he never went to the
prom because he was too afraid

00:45:50.670 --> 00:45:53.190
and didn't have the
courage that Emma has.

00:45:53.190 --> 00:45:57.250
And I don't want
to spoil anything,

00:45:57.250 --> 00:46:01.060
but once it seems like
the prom is back on,

00:46:01.060 --> 00:46:04.530
Emma goes to Barry's
hotel room and says

00:46:04.530 --> 00:46:07.320
she wants him to be
her date for the prom.

00:46:07.320 --> 00:46:12.170
And she leaves, and
he sings the song.

00:46:12.170 --> 00:46:13.435
Brooks Ashmanskas.

00:46:17.395 --> 00:46:18.630
BROOKS ASHMANSKAS: Thank you.

00:46:18.630 --> 00:46:19.130
Hit it.

 PROM"]

00:48:53.542 --> 00:48:55.526

00:48:55.526 --> 00:48:56.518
Thank you.

00:49:02.500 --> 00:49:05.560
MATT MAGER: One more time, give
it up for the entire cast--

00:49:05.560 --> 00:49:09.110
no, sorry, the leading cast
of "The Prom" the musical.

00:49:09.110 --> 00:49:11.620
[APPLAUSE]

00:49:11.620 --> 00:49:14.250
Thank you so much everyone.
