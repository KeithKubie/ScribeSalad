00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:02.480
Hey, everybody.

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:05.440
Welcome here to a beautiful day in San Francisco.

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:08.269
We're on the roof of the Moscone center.

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:10.160
I know we showed you something really special
yesterday.

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:15.110
And we got so much interest that we wanted
to show you how we put it all together.

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:19.990
And, actually, we wanted to show you some
of the pretty same exciting action that you

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.180
saw, but from a new perspective this time.

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:25.220
So you can see, this is the roof.

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.970
Some of our bikers are warming up out there.

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.480
And they're doing some of their cool tricks,
getting ready for their part of this demonstration.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.150
You can also see that the airship is actually
overhead.

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:43.410
You might be able to see it through my view
through my Glass in the Hangout.

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:49.010
And we actually have a number of the jumpers
in the Hangout now.

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:55.300
Now, as I walk over here, you'll see that
it's actually tricky to keep them in the Hangout

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.370
because of the really challenging wireless
environment.

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:09.649
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: And if I can show you all on
here, we're pointing each of these dishes,

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:13.549
using different kinds of RF technology for
redundancy.

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:16.939
Each jumper has a different piece of technology
coming down.

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:21.829
And that's how we felt comfortable that we
could maintain at least a couple of them in

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:23.670
the Hangout.

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.979
I'm also, by the way, testing out a new kind
of iteration of Glass with these shade clip-ins

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.610
here right now.

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.159
And they're -- definitely makes it better
out here in the bright sun.

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:43.569
So we're going to have -- we've worked, you
know, with a lot of people around here, with

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:49.609
the City of San Francisco, the FAA, and the
municipal offices of Oakland and San Jose

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:50.650
to make this happen.

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:53.590
But the coordination is pretty tricky, as
you might imagine.

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:54.750
Let’s see.

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.460
Our jump master is here.

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:57.460
This is Marshal.

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:58.709
Marshal, how far out are we?

00:01:58.709 --> 00:02:02.150
&gt;&gt;&gt; We’re under two minutes from the wing
suits being in the air.

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:03.530
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: We’re under two minutes?

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:04.530
Ok.

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:05.530
That's super exciting.

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:10.920
And you guys might be able to see their perspectives
right now in the Hangout live.

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.750
This is pretty exciting to me.

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.830
How's -- have you heard from J.T.?

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:16.660
How are they doing up there?

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:22.240
&gt;&gt;&gt; They're in position right now.

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:25.010
They're going to hover a little while, open
the door, they're going to fly in their wing

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:26.010
suits northwest of us here, deploy their parachutes.

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.330
And then you and I will be out here and it
will be high fives and smiles when they land.

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:29.560
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: Alright awesome.

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.250
Since we only have a couple minutes, why don't
you guys walk with me.

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.000
I want to get closer to their landing zone.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:42.080
And, you know, as we go here, I can just point
out, I mean, it's just stunning here.

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:47.050
But if you look over there, as we walk toward
the landing zone, you can see a fog bank right

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:48.670
over there.

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.800
And that fog bank is actually very scary to
us.

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.120
It seems to be clearing out, so we feel good
about the jump today.

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.380
But there was no guarantee.

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:03.800
And, in fact, I should note that skydiving,
you know, there's no such thing as instrument

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:04.800
skydiving.

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:05.800
You actually have to see your landing.

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.650
Though I guess, conceivably, with Glass, you
could make an instrument version.

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:11.800
You have a nice heads-up display where you're
going.

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.030
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: But, anyway, we'll have to
try that another time.

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:16.830
I know, I'm scaring my jump master.

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.410
Today, we have sunny skies.

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:23.490
You can see -- there's the airship pretty
much straight overhead.

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:25.810
I don't know if we can get -- maybe we'll
get another shot of that.

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.350
We have a few cameras scattered here that
can show you that.

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:33.250
And let's keep walking here.

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:37.090
A lot of exciting action.

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:47.290
Now, I don't want to -- I don't want to block
your view.

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:52.460
Hopefully, the audience is seeing right now
-- how is our Hangout going?

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:53.650
&gt;&gt;&gt; We're ready to go up to the airship.

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:54.650
&gt;&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:55.650
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: Okay.

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:56.650
They're ready to jump.

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:57.650
Cool.

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:58.650
How's our view in the Hangout coming along?

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:59.790
&gt;&gt;&gt; I think J.T. is ready.

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:01.470
Go up to J.T.

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:02.470
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: Okay.

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:04.350
That's so cool.

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:06.970
Why don't we throw it up to J.T. and he can
take it away.

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:10.250
And, hopefully, this Hangout will go as well
as yesterday did.

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:11.260
But, you know, you never know.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:12.910
A million things can go wrong.

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:14.680
Okay, take it away, J.T.

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:15.680
&gt;&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.299
Good to be here, Terry.

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:20.650
Yeah, lucky with that fog.

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:23.919
Good job calling ahead on that one, Sergey.

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:26.669
And Marshal, who's going to run the countdown?

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:30.229
Neal, on the airship is going to be counting
down.

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:32.179
The door is open.

00:04:32.179 --> 00:04:34.129
&gt;&gt;&gt; Good morning, San Francisco!

00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:36.169
Hey, how are the winds doing down there?

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:37.169
All right.

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:38.169
Well, we're going for it.

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:39.229
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: Okay.

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:40.389
We've got 30 seconds, everyone.

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:41.389
I'm super excited about this.

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:42.389
&gt;&gt;&gt; See you in a few.

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:46.330
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: Airship is almost straight
overhead.

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:47.840
It's a beautiful day.

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:51.770
We're really lucking out that the fog is holding
back.

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:54.940
Door is open.

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:56.949
Pretty much standing still right now.

00:04:56.949 --> 00:04:59.210
&gt;&gt;&gt; Just going that way.

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:01.020
God, that --
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: That must be a beautiful feeling

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:05.309
to just fly right out of there.

00:05:05.309 --> 00:05:08.379
&gt;&gt;&gt; Five, four, three, two, one!

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:09.610
&gt;&gt;&gt; Jumping away.

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:12.509
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: There they are!

00:05:12.509 --> 00:05:15.669
There they are!

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:20.949
You can see them flying.

00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:27.069
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: They're soaring across the
sky.

00:05:27.069 --> 00:05:29.479
Look at that.

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:34.009
They're weaving closely in and out of each
other.

00:05:34.009 --> 00:05:36.520
The Hangout footage, I'm sorry, I don't have
it.

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:38.879
It must be beautiful.

00:05:38.879 --> 00:05:41.250
Their chutes are opening.

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:43.380
We've got two chutes open.

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:46.550
And the third one, with a puff of smoke, just
opened.

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:53.719
If you're wondering why, we had to put one
of them with a puff of smoke so the radio-aiming

00:05:53.719 --> 00:05:57.639
folks could know which skydiver was theirs.

00:05:57.639 --> 00:06:01.879
&gt;&gt;&gt; Walk over here and -- we'll try to give
them high fives as they land.

00:06:01.879 --> 00:06:06.569
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: Yes, if we can get over this
way pretty quick, and, hopefully, you guys

00:06:06.569 --> 00:06:11.919
can tag along.

00:06:11.919 --> 00:06:17.669
Okay, bikers ready.

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:20.150
You can see we're getting ready.

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:22.690
Skydivers coming down.

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:25.849
All right.

00:06:25.849 --> 00:06:27.590
Where should I stand here?

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:31.230
&gt;&gt;&gt; Going to land right --
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: Okay.

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:35.259
You can see them clearly.

00:06:35.259 --> 00:06:40.759
You can now --

00:06:40.759 --> 00:06:49.939
&gt;&gt;&gt; Give us 30 meters out.

00:06:49.939 --> 00:06:57.279
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: All right.

00:06:57.279 --> 00:07:04.620
&gt;&gt;&gt; Step right over here.

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:06.467
They're going to be landing, coming towards
us.

00:07:06.467 --> 00:07:07.467
&gt;&gt;&gt; Here comes J.T. right here.

00:07:07.467 --> 00:07:08.467
&gt;&gt;&gt; All right.

00:07:08.467 --> 00:07:09.467
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: Woo-hoo!

00:07:09.467 --> 00:07:10.467
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:07:10.467 --> 00:07:11.467
&gt;&gt;&gt; Yeah, buddy.

00:07:11.467 --> 00:07:12.467
Yeah, all right!

00:07:12.467 --> 00:07:13.467
[ Applause ]

00:07:13.467 --> 00:07:14.467
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: Incoming.

00:07:14.467 --> 00:07:15.467
&gt;&gt;&gt; Whoa all right!

00:07:15.467 --> 00:07:16.467
Nice!

00:07:16.467 --> 00:07:17.467
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: That was awesome.

00:07:17.467 --> 00:07:18.467
&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks for having us.

00:07:18.467 --> 00:07:19.467
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: Thanks for coming down.

00:07:19.467 --> 00:07:20.467
All right.

00:07:20.467 --> 00:07:21.467
That was amazing.

00:07:21.467 --> 00:07:22.467
&gt;&gt;&gt; Good job.

00:07:22.467 --> 00:07:23.467
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: All of our jumpers are down.

00:07:23.467 --> 00:07:24.467
And they make it look so easy.

00:07:24.467 --> 00:07:25.467
All right.

00:07:25.467 --> 00:07:26.467
Don't get blown away here.

00:07:26.467 --> 00:07:27.467
Hey, hey, that was great.

00:07:27.467 --> 00:07:28.467
Thanks, again.

00:07:28.467 --> 00:07:29.467
Amazing jump.

00:07:29.467 --> 00:07:30.467
Thanks, guys.

00:07:30.467 --> 00:07:31.467
&gt;&gt;&gt; That was awesome.

00:07:31.467 --> 00:07:32.467
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: Great job.

00:07:32.467 --> 00:07:34.879
All right, thanks, guys, so much.

00:07:34.879 --> 00:07:40.729
Now, don't forget, we tested -- that was an
amazing jump.

00:07:40.729 --> 00:07:44.139
We have more in store to show you just how
did we do the rest of it.

00:07:44.139 --> 00:07:45.919
We have our excellent bikers here.

00:07:45.919 --> 00:07:49.169
And this is a really fun area here.

00:07:49.169 --> 00:07:51.099
There are a few kind of natural blocks and
things.

00:07:51.099 --> 00:07:56.389
But the killer thing that we put in there,
because the roof goes up and down, there's

00:07:56.389 --> 00:07:58.389
a really great ramp that we put in there.

00:07:58.389 --> 00:08:01.229
And that was where you saw that magical moment.

00:08:01.229 --> 00:08:07.219
So maybe we can actually get a chance to see
the bikers -- let's see what you guys got!

00:08:07.219 --> 00:08:10.339
All right.

00:08:10.339 --> 00:08:15.690
And we're going to try to make our way so
we can first of all watch this.

00:08:15.690 --> 00:08:16.690
Watch this.

00:08:16.690 --> 00:08:17.690
Yeah!

00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:18.690
Whoa, another back flip.

00:08:18.690 --> 00:08:20.530
That was amazing.

00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:22.180
All right.

00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:26.000
We're going to head over now and try to catch
them on the other side.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.849
The roof goes, actually, up, and then there's
the giant dropoff on the other side.

00:08:30.849 --> 00:08:32.589
So here we are.

00:08:32.589 --> 00:08:36.560
And -- actually, it's kind of cool, because
I don't know if you guys can see me right

00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:37.560
now.

00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:39.520
I'm now in a Hangout.

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:42.229
Back on the other side, had a little bit of
issues keeping me in the Hangout.

00:08:42.229 --> 00:08:44.180
But here it's working nicely.

00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:47.820
And it's a -- I mean, I know they make it
look easy.

00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:51.170
But they're probably, what, 15 feet up there?

00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:55.410
And they're going to just show us how they
get down off that big ramp.

00:08:55.410 --> 00:09:01.100
All right, guys.

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:07.040
Let's see you go.

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:12.920
&gt;&gt;&gt; Go, go, go!

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:20.760
&gt;&gt;&gt; They're hitting the drop.

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:24.680
&gt;&gt;&gt; All right.

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:32.520
See you down there.

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:40.090
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: You can see that they're -- we've
got three, actually.

00:09:40.090 --> 00:09:41.360
And it's a long way down.

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:42.620
It's a long way down.

00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:49.440
I'm actually going to take off my Glass so
you can see this.

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:52.960
Okay.

00:09:52.960 --> 00:10:14.430
Now, hopefully, they've made it down safe
and sound.

00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:29.580
Thank you, all, for watching.

00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:33.670
I know we have a lot of interest.

00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:38.790
And we just wanted to show for the people
who just, you know, heard about it just yesterday,

00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:44.060
want to show you about something that it took
and actually show you some of that amazing

00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:45.220
action again.

00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:46.390
All right.

00:10:46.390 --> 00:10:51.550
Well, we'll keep you abreast of our progress
on Glass.

00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:56.440
This is just one of the exciting things that
we've had the privilege of working on and

00:10:56.440 --> 00:11:00.779
that -- I'm hoping this is going to lead to
something really exciting going forward.
