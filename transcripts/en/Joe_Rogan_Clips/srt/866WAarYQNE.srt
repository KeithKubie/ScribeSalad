1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:04,680
Yeah, it's so fucking good, man.
Why is style bender and Jon Jones,

2
00:00:04,681 --> 00:00:08,520
why are they talking shit to each other?
Do you know what started it? Yeah. Um,

3
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:12,570
John did a, originally it
started, it did start with John.

4
00:00:12,571 --> 00:00:15,480
He came out in the interview and goes,
you know, style Benner's looking good.

5
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:19,230
He's fighting 85 it's only a matter
of time before I think we cross paths,

6
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:23,880
which is silly. And then style bender,
I think TMZ asked him, he's like, oh,

7
00:00:23,881 --> 00:00:27,030
I already beat one goat. I need another
one. You know, I'm just getting started.

8
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:30,000
But if you're a John,
why are you even engaging in this?

9
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:34,680
Why are you punching down
John? Because Sanchez, well,

10
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:37,680
it's great for John because he
wants to let everybody know, hey,

11
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:40,890
I'm the best motherfucker on the planet.
But yeah,

12
00:00:40,891 --> 00:00:42,680
but he wants to let everybody
know like when he's,

13
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:45,240
when there's a car that's about someone
out. I mean, he's active now, right?

14
00:00:45,241 --> 00:00:48,180
Jon Jones got momentum.
Now think about where he's at right now.

15
00:00:48,181 --> 00:00:49,440
He's in his thirties right?

16
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,540
Long Ass fucking career as
champion as the best ever. Correct.

17
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:55,170
He's on a run right now.
That's what I think.

18
00:00:55,171 --> 00:00:59,250
I think they took it away from him for
all those months when he tested positive,

19
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:02,040
that long suspension,
all that time off,

20
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:06,450
all money that he should have made all
the legacy that he could've laid down.

21
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,120
And I now, I think, I think he's just
fucking chasing it and the best about it.

22
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:14,100
Have you sent all about it?
However, talking to 80 183
pounders, kinda silly. Yeah,

23
00:01:14,101 --> 00:01:17,280
but what if you say that in an interview?
I don't think that's that disrespect.

24
00:01:17,281 --> 00:01:18,610
I don't either.
By the way.

25
00:01:18,611 --> 00:01:20,520
You said it is that one day
maybe we're going to fight. Yeah.

26
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:24,090
But then style bender, you know TMZ ask
them, they know shit about finding like,

27
00:01:24,091 --> 00:01:26,610
oh, this guy's big. This guy is big.
They're both black. Let's fight.

28
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,820
They have no idea. Yeah, no, that's
what they think. Right? So then,

29
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:34,710
then it gets picked up. But then also
I think Jon Jones is the hot, you know,

30
00:01:34,711 --> 00:01:36,870
senior in high school
and style of vendors.

31
00:01:36,871 --> 00:01:39,750
The new freshman who's hot and it's
like mean girls like fuck that dude.

32
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:43,990
It's also a wonder how much of this is
like, they all agree is good for business.

33
00:01:43,991 --> 00:01:47,940
It's entertainment. Consonance, anytime
there's a fire blast, something out.

34
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:50,640
Well not just blast something out.
I mean is real good about that.

35
00:01:50,641 --> 00:01:55,350
But like the way he's
able to turn these shit,

36
00:01:55,351 --> 00:01:59,230
talking back and forth into
publicity for fights, they all,

37
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,860
there is real shit talking
to his psychological warfare,

38
00:02:01,861 --> 00:02:06,030
but it also hypes people have to know
and like the Khabib fight all the

39
00:02:06,031 --> 00:02:08,760
craziness that led to that.
Obviously that backfired.

40
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:11,610
When could we tried to fucking attack
him after it was over and it was,

41
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:12,990
it was an adjustment crowd.

42
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:15,660
Even alveolar people punched him
in the head and all that craziness.

43
00:02:15,661 --> 00:02:18,630
That beams never been bigger. Yeah.
Look, could bebes never been bigger.

44
00:02:18,631 --> 00:02:23,280
Connor's never been bigger and yeah, I
mean he needs to fight. You need to find,

45
00:02:23,281 --> 00:02:25,650
needs a fight he needs to fight on still.
You guys know this.

46
00:02:25,651 --> 00:02:28,530
I ride Connor's nuts. I write
competes nuts. Stop. And there's nuts.

47
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:31,500
But with condom, like God, hopefully
something gets lined up. Yeah.

48
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:34,780
But what I'm trying to say is like that
shit talking keeps you relevant. It was,

49
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:37,290
yeah, it's worth something.
It's worth something. The green,

50
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:40,980
both of them agree like if style bender
and Jon Jones did decide to fight one

51
00:02:40,981 --> 00:02:44,670
day it, that shit's worth something
to both of them. Agree. Yeah. Agree.

52
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:49,710
Just a big gap between 85 and two oh
five though, man. John's a giant tool.

53
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:53,610
Fiverr John John could beat up any
heavyweight in the world with these could

54
00:02:53,611 --> 00:02:56,150
beat up probably six of them in a night.
So to,

55
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:59,860
to fight a one 83 or is weird.
Yeah.

56
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:04,070
Well obviously he wouldn't be one 83
if style bender was going to do it,

57
00:03:04,071 --> 00:03:07,000
I'm sure he'd want to put some
some weight on and imagine it just,

58
00:03:07,001 --> 00:03:08,110
that's such a nightmare.

59
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:11,500
But that's what makes style Ben or
special cause those guys same as mashed,

60
00:03:11,501 --> 00:03:14,460
hollered. He goes, I'll fight
anyone. Yeah, sure. That's,
that's what it's all about.

61
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:17,860
Also like, and this is not a
knock on Santos or you know,

62
00:03:17,861 --> 00:03:20,650
the level of competition at two oh five
there's really nothing there you get

63
00:03:20,651 --> 00:03:23,650
excited about. There's just not,
you look at the other divisions.

64
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:25,870
Santos can be a fun fight.

65
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:30,190
He's going to be a plus 700
plus 800 underdog. So, you know,

66
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:33,700
but I liked that John's active. I like
watching John. Yeah. Beat everyone's ass.

67
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:34,983
Yeah.
It's,

68
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:39,670
it's one of those things now where you've
got to find contenders for John, right?

69
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:41,650
Because there's no one's
really standing out.

70
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,150
Rockhold would be cool at two oh five so
heavyweights, Dominic gray is just beat.

71
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:49,500
Who did he beat? Did he fight Volk on
hosed Amir? No. Yeah, he did. He thought,

72
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:52,210
and I didn't think he beat him.
And I'm a race fan,

73
00:03:52,211 --> 00:03:54,510
but I don't think you need those.
The man, I thought he lost. Yeah,

74
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:59,020
that's what I was, I was a weird
decision that, so that one is, look,

75
00:03:59,021 --> 00:04:01,180
Vulcans have very good fighter.
No doubt about it.

76
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,280
But you saw with Daniel
Cormier did to him.

77
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:06,100
Neither one of them are ready for
Josh not ready for John's. Not even,

78
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:07,930
they're not even the
same realm. Right. So,

79
00:04:07,931 --> 00:04:10,960
but we were looking at Dominic and
we're like that kids really talented,

80
00:04:10,961 --> 00:04:14,380
super pro. He's got massive potential and
I still think he does. They all, yeah,

81
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:18,250
you know, so stuck. He's just going to
get better from this Johnny Walker. Right.

82
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:21,610
But that guy might have blown shoulder.
Let's say he doesn't though.

83
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:24,360
If he doesn't, he's still thinking
we're fight away from John Jones.

84
00:04:24,361 --> 00:04:25,810
He might be four fights away.
Here's the thing,

85
00:04:25,811 --> 00:04:29,470
he might knock for people into another
dimension on the way to John Jones.

86
00:04:29,471 --> 00:04:31,430
Like guy's something special.
And that's what I'm saying. Yeah,

87
00:04:31,431 --> 00:04:34,480
but you got to knock this four guys
out so we can sell this thing. He does.

88
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:39,490
I mean he's, he's put away to top
level guys, uh, pretty spectacularly.

89
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,970
And um,
I mean you look at the way he fights too.

90
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:48,130
He's loose and weird and then boom, jumps
on you and it's so special. Hower dude.

91
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,630
Fucking crazy power. But I think with
John, his team smart the gun, no,

92
00:04:52,631 --> 00:04:55,630
we know heavyweights there.
We're going to clean out to a five.

93
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:57,940
Ain't nobody been this were clear,
clean out.

94
00:04:57,941 --> 00:05:00,280
So we're considered the
greatest of all time.

95
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:04,540
Then when go to heavy weight and get paid,
well, you know they wanted this fight.

96
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:07,870
They thought it would be a good fight
with Tiago and I think one of the,

97
00:05:07,871 --> 00:05:09,280
one of the things that a good fight,

98
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:13,000
one of the reasons why it's a good fight
is Tiago can shut anyone's lights out.

99
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:15,520
He knows he can shut anyone's lights out.

100
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:20,640
That motherfucker throws for the
beliefs and used to fight at 70 no 85

101
00:05:20,831 --> 00:05:25,060
[inaudible] 85 [inaudible] 85 struggled
to make 85 like he's big. He's big,

102
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:28,360
he's big. A big dude. He's like the
fucking power that that guy has.

103
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:31,660
And I heard the Manoa fight
and he just swings, man.

104
00:05:31,661 --> 00:05:35,500
He swings wild now John is not
going to fight him the way man.

105
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,333
And we'll finally get in touch.

106
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:39,450
You know John is going to keep on the
outside with those kicks and take him ties

107
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:41,560
to clinch him. He'll
clinch him, wrestle him,

108
00:05:41,561 --> 00:05:45,570
take them down John's ground and pound
his horrific as top games off the chart.

109
00:05:45,571 --> 00:05:48,520
Missions are great submissions.
Everything strikings better.

110
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:51,430
Elbows are from hell,
from the top.

111
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:54,850
Just gets on top of you the best you're
getting elbowed to oblivion and they're

112
00:05:54,851 --> 00:05:59,080
coming one after the other. Fti
there after the other, but the,

113
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:04,240
in the wild exchange where he has
to be careful is that that Tiago,

114
00:06:04,491 --> 00:06:08,030
dude, Tiago Santos, we'll
swing with everything Johnson,

115
00:06:08,031 --> 00:06:11,150
he will throw it all in there.
John Diamond engage in that.

116
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:12,930
You're not going to see the opportunity.
I mean,

117
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:15,140
that's what makes them so special.
Those guys that go,

118
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:19,250
that's where your one places dwin watch
this. Yeah, he just canceled it out.

119
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:23,810
I don't think that he would
willingly wade into a firefight,

120
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:26,870
but like that could happen, but it
could have that tie cell fight, sir.

121
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:30,050
It could happen. See what John
is going to do. If I had a gas,

122
00:06:30,051 --> 00:06:33,590
has tried to further cement his legacy,
he's going to fight the best way he can.

123
00:06:33,591 --> 00:06:35,810
He's got great coaches.
They know what the fuck they're doing.

124
00:06:35,811 --> 00:06:37,610
He's going to go in there.
He's going to kick that dude.

125
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:38,960
If you decided to clench with them,

126
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,970
he's going to have a giant
advantage in the wrestling,

127
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,720
but he's got to be careful on the
way in, man, that dude will swing.

128
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:48,110
We'll try to kill you.
He tr he swings in a different way.

129
00:06:48,111 --> 00:06:51,890
He swings like this ain't making it to
the fifth round. There's no fifth round.

130
00:06:51,891 --> 00:06:55,310
He's not even looking to get,
he's, that guy is just every shot.

131
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:58,130
He's trying to take the lights out. No,
I'm out. I'm definitely gonna Watch it.

132
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,160
He's a wild motherfucker, man. I
think this is an interesting fight.

133
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:04,520
Jon Jones should be the strong favorite,
should be a giant favor,

134
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:07,940
but it doesn't mean it's not going to
be interesting because this dude's style

135
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:11,120
cause he's so fucking wild.
The question's going to be how he perform.

136
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:14,540
How does he perform when you, when that
octagon door shuts and you look over,

137
00:07:14,541 --> 00:07:17,690
you see it's Jon Jones and
title fight the tunnel fight.

138
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:22,700
But I think one of the reasons why John
Talking Shit to style Benner is one of

139
00:07:22,701 --> 00:07:24,590
the pros is we're talking about them,
right?

140
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:28,880
Because we probably want to talk
about him. Verse Santos on this show.

141
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:31,970
If it wasn't happening, it
keeps them relevant. You know,

142
00:07:31,971 --> 00:07:35,960
he is probably the biggest name
in the sport now. Outside Connor,

143
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:39,020
the guy who's the most active him and
could be proud of the biggest names and

144
00:07:39,021 --> 00:07:42,050
talking shit to stop bender actually
think it helped style bender too, right?

145
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,240
Because now he's associated
with the greatest of all time.

146
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,800
He wants to be the greatest of all time,

147
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,230
but when you just did and
it's going to get there,

148
00:07:48,231 --> 00:07:50,190
and I can't fucking wait when he goes,
all right,

149
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:55,160
I'm ready for heavyweight him verse
Francis. What are we going to do?

150
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:56,990
What are we going to do?
