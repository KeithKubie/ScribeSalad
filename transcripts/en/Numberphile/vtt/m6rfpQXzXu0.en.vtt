00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:06.000
Quantum theory, the world of the smallest particles, is actually influencing mathematics, and

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:11.100
I would even say that the future is for quantum mathematicians.

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:17.900
Mathematics is also what mathematicians do, and we do this with our brain, and so how is our brain created?

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.150
Well, many many million years of evolution. And so I think our concepts

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:25.760
are very much influenced by the things to see around us.

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.800
So we talk about space because we kind of move in space,

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.629
We move in time. We count because we see objects. We throw stones,

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.120
we want to describe the path of a stone and its velocity.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:44.600
And so calculus, for instance, is based on the idea of speed or slope.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.589
So I think actually our mind is very much kind of set by everyday experience.

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:56.600
So you might think that mathematics kind of stops being effective if we move into a new territory.

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:03.220
For instance, the very large, the universe, or the very small, the world of elementary particles.

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:07.289
But a remarkable thing: this hasn't happened. So mathematics has been

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:13.019
extremely successful in conquering, certainly I think, the physical experience.

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:16.780
General relativity,

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.759
Einstein's theory is a good example.

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:24.080
He needed a concept of curved space. And it turns out that Riemann and others,

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:29.180
in the 19th century, had already thought about it. They thought, you have two dimensions, three dimensions,

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:31.900
why not have an arbitrary number of dimensions?

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:38.000
Abstract thinking of mathematicians was kind of ahead. In quantum theory,

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:43.438
you know, even if you sit and meditate for a million years you wouldn't come up with the laws of quantum

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:49.199
mechanics because it's so bizarre. So in that sense nature had to force that upon us,

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:56.000
and it was like a very painful process. We had to let go of many very cherished concepts.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.800
For instance, the fact that the world is a predictable system. Quantum mechanics is just the way nature works.

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.299
You see it very clearly at the level of atoms and elementary particles,

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:12.059
and if you take many many atoms together, then in some sense many of the features of quantum mechanics

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:20.100
are kind of washed away. We don't observe it because we are made out of like 10 to the 24 molecules typically.

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.929
There are several things that you have to give up in quantum mechanics. The first is that you cannot know the answer to all questions.

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:34.069
So, for instance, typically, I would say, well, this is pen, I know where it is, and if I drop it,

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:38.298
I know what the velocity is; that it's moving. Quantum mechanics says that's all fine,

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:44.480
you can know either the position or the velocity, so roughly half the questions are unanswerable.

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.319
That's really bizarre, because how would I then describe a pen?

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.179
But there's a second thing, which is that even if you want to describe

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:59.389
how things move, they never have a specific answer. So, like if you are a

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:04.309
classical object like a pen, now you would say "How do I go from A to B?"

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.409
Well there will be a shortest path. If I throw a stone it will go like this from A to B.

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:11.989
And I will know exactly how it went,

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:17.508
and this is like the optimal path, and I can calculate this, and mathematics is about this. Now, if you're a

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:23.328
quantum mechanical particle, you are basically free to go on any possible

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:28.969
path, so you know, and you could even have really very bizarre paths that goes all the way like that.

00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:34.698
And the thing that physics will do, it will give a certain probability for all these

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:40.819
possible scenarios. If I for instance want to go from my work to home

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:44.200
I know pretty good what the path is I'm taking,

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:49.429
but if I'm an electron that's moving, say, from one atom to another atom,

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.590
it's more like these, these curves, so everything is in terms of chance.

00:03:54.590 --> 00:04:01.600
The quantum probability is something, it's like an, it's a complex number, and if you take the absolute value squared,

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.700
it becomes actual probabilities.

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:09.629
So for instance, one thing that, because of these kind of funny things, what can happen is that

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:13.728
instead, you know, even if you think about where a particle is,

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:19.519
now it could be either here, or it could be here, and you might say, well there's a certain probability

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:21.589
it's an A, and a probability it's in B.

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:28.609
But a quantum mechanical particle can be for half be here and half be there, at the same time.

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.040
So this is very strange.

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:38.380
It's like you take a point, and you divide it in two fractions of a point, put one here and put one there.

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:43.620
And so the rules of quantum mechanics are partly captured probability,

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:51.379
but they have some kind of very strange phenomena built in them, and it's ... you have to kind of dig deep and basically things

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.900
happening, you know, all at the same time

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.600
makes quantum mechanics very difficult to absorb.

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:02.400
It's been said, you know, if you say you understand quantum mechanics that you're just lying, because this is

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.590
something that in our intuition we simply cannot understand.

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:14.270
Physicists were thinking about, well, we need some objects, for instance, to describe the transitions in the atom,

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.250
how we go from one state to another state,

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:21.709
so well, we need something, and then they discovered it's called a matrix, and it's actually known, of course, in the mathematical literature.

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:23.900
But to understand the

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:30.830
concepts that came in, like Hilbert spaces and wave functions, that was mathematics that partly was being developed at that time,

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:34.909
but I would say then the physicists really ran off with it,

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:38.090
and at this point, I would say mathematicians are

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:40.880
trying to catch up and

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.110
understand, you know,

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:47.900
not only the language, but also the power of the concept. Because there's something incredibly

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:53.149
natural in quantum theory which is perfect for the mathematical mind.

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:56.569
Because mathematicians, they're not studying one object.

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:04.790
They actually really always think about the whole family; the category, all possible objects. So, all numbers at the same time, or all possible

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:11.780
geometrical shapes. And what quantum mechanics says is, that's like perfect, because I'm not considering one path,

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:17.959
I'm considering the space of all paths. And in fact, I'm giving you something else. I'm giving you a way,

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:21.679
indeed, a probability of each possible path,

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:28.040
so in some way, you can sum all over these different paths. We call this the sum over histories

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:30.590
which is a ...

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:35.359
again, very funny concept, because we think of history as something, well,

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:41.200
certain things, certain facts that happens. For the quantum mechanical mathematician,

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:47.149
history is all possible scenarios at the same time. And so there's a certain way to

00:06:47.699 --> 00:06:50.749
consider many different things at the same time. And so one

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:59.400
wonderful application on all of this was in, in knot theory. So if you have a knot, like this,

00:07:00.389 --> 00:07:03.000
connected like this, so it's a ... it's a... I'm just

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:07.070
drawing here the projection, but there's a certain trajectory in three dimensions, and, you know,

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:12.169
mathematicians want to distinguish. This one is knotted, this one is not. And so, if you're a knot

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:18.049
theorist, you want to study knots in generality; the space of all possible knots. Actually

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:20.180
quantum theory comes to the rescue.

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:26.810
It's a very efficient way to describe these knots. And young physicists are not that surprised anymore as

00:07:27.479 --> 00:07:29.160
for instance Niels Bohr or

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:34.339
Albert Einstein was, who were really fighting the concept. I often think, you know, at some point there will be a generation of mathematicians

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:41.000
that kind of grow, grow up with quantum theory, and they will probably apply these kinds of rules in a very natural way.

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:43.600
Brady: "They are starting to steal your stuff, arent they?"

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:47.550
Exactly. So, the remarkable thing is that there are some very deep

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:52.300
mathematical problems; abstract mathematical problems, like this classification of all knots,

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:59.200
or thinking of four- or six-dimensional spaces, really purely interested from mathematical arguments,

00:07:59.210 --> 00:08:06.710
and now there is a bunch of these problems that actually have been solved using quantum theory. I think of it like a good mathematician

00:08:07.410 --> 00:08:11.689
has a toolbox that's filled with everything: geometry,

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:14.400
calculus, number theory,

00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:17.500
and, you know, the rules of modern physics should be there.

00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:24.229
It's just a very efficient way to deal with certain problems, and I am actually ... I think many mathematicians were surprised that the

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:29.870
information was flowing in the other direction. Physicists are surprised, because they see the quantum

00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:33.229
mathematicians, so to say, take these ideas and

00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:35.080
generalise them even further.

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:40.200
It's like you have a very brilliant student and you're teaching the student everything you know,

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:44.000
and then the student takes that much further, because again,

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:51.410
and that's the beauty of math. It is, in some sense, rooted in reality, but then it's not. It's hard to meet a

00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:53.990
mathematician that's not ...

00:08:54.210 --> 00:08:55.020
doesn't think

00:08:55.020 --> 00:09:00.650
platonic; thinks that, you know, the prime numbers are just out there, and they have nothing to do with the fact that there are

00:09:00.650 --> 00:09:03.319
three pens here. That the number three is there.

00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:06.469
And so, there's this kind of

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:09.210
interesting kind of an

00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:11.210
oscillation between math

00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:13.440
absorbing

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:14.910
facts from reality,

00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:21.739
and then kind of take a flight of the imagination, and go in directions that the physicist says, wait a moment that was not

00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:24.900
actually our intent to go and do, to do this kind of crazy stuff.

00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:30.500
Brady: "Has this emergence of mathematics coming out of physics been a difficult birth? Has it been

00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:32.523
"something that has caused problems?"

00:09:32.523 --> 00:09:34.600
Yes. In two directions, I think.

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:37.840
You know, the physicists would say math is very attractive,

00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:43.399
but it's like a black hole in which you can disappear, because you will be divorced from reality.

00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:50.420
Odysseus, you have to tie yourself to the to the mast of the ship not to be seduced by the beauty of mathematics

00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:52.560
because

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:58.820
many of the great insights in physics were looked very painful and inelegant and ugly

00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:01.670
to begin with. It took some time to appreciate

00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:08.300
quantum theory as something beautiful. So that's the rivalry from the physics part. From the math part,

00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:15.169
I think it is that, you know, physicists are sometimes seen as kind of plumbers, they, you know, they make their hands dirty,

00:10:15.210 --> 00:10:18.170
they deal with this messy thing called reality.

00:10:19.050 --> 00:10:25.729
It's beautiful, as a mathematician, you can go this platonic world where there's a certain perfectness. So there's also

00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:29.000
I think quite a few mathematicians that weren't originally

00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:32.509
impressed with the physical ideas. They might say, well,

00:10:32.510 --> 00:10:38.119
you know, you might kind of be ... this might ... one or two areas where this is relevant, but not to my field,

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:42.500
which is pristine. And then certainly,

00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:44.970
out of left field,

00:10:44.970 --> 00:10:49.399
there were some physical ideas that proved to be very very very powerful,

00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:59.200
and I feel it's like a wave, you know, you're, you think it won't hurt you until the wave hits you, and then suddenly you are underwater.

00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:05.060
In physics we have really a crisis, and the crisis is that we have two

00:11:05.759 --> 00:11:07.849
wonderful theories that describe the world.

00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:09.620
One is quantum

00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:16.429
theory: It's perfect for elementary particles. The other one is relativity, and it's used to describe large structures in the universe.

00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:23.149
But the point is these two things clash, and they clash because these physical laws of the large. They include

00:11:23.610 --> 00:11:30.499
events like black holes, and perhaps more important, the big bang, where the rules of physics break down.

00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:38.029
So this is quite remarkable that the theory that you have to describe reality has its own failure built into it; and

00:11:38.610 --> 00:11:43.370
we think that, in some sense, the only solution is

00:11:43.949 --> 00:11:50.869
to bring quantum mechanics into it. So we somehow have to marry these two pictures. It's not enough to do quantum mechanics.

00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:55.459
It's not enough to do geometry. And we know this is happening, because the universe is working,

00:11:55.459 --> 00:12:00.018
you know, right now while we speaking, the laws of nature are perfectly working,

00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:05.360
and there's no breakdown anywhere. So that means that we have to come up with something

00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:07.940
deeper than geometry.

00:12:08.339 --> 00:12:10.339
Now what is that?

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:14.899
That's, that's, I think, the big mystery. And we have some ideas.

00:12:15.209 --> 00:12:19.399
So, the idea could be that geometry is something like

00:12:20.069 --> 00:12:27.709
thermodynamics, which is the theory that describes, basically, materials. So if I think of this table, it feels pretty solid to me,

00:12:27.709 --> 00:12:29.929
but I know it's a large collection of molecules.

00:12:30.449 --> 00:12:34.249
I feel the air around me, and I feel a certain temperature.

00:12:34.589 --> 00:12:38.359
But there's no such thing as temperature, these are just molecules bouncing up and down.

00:12:39.029 --> 00:12:44.388
So could it be that just as this physical sheet of paper, if I zoom in, zoom in, zoom in,

00:12:44.670 --> 00:12:49.729
I will certainly see molecules and atoms and elementary particles, and there's no paper anymore,

00:12:50.370 --> 00:12:56.479
could it be that if I zoom into space itself, at some point I see the pixels?

00:12:57.059 --> 00:13:03.889
I see something else? You know, we were thinking perhaps it's pure informations, like zeroes and ones. So, I find that absolutely

00:13:04.769 --> 00:13:08.779
breathtaking. Because if you are able to come up with a piece of mathematics

00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:16.879
that is more fundamental than space, than geometry, I think it would be

00:13:18.210 --> 00:13:20.210
revolutionising all of math.

00:13:23.810 --> 00:13:25.430
Just imagine

00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:30.910
trying to imagine these two huge objects what they're doing to the matter, to the space-time around it as

00:13:31.070 --> 00:13:36.640
they, and the space-time must be going "oh my god what's happening here", and it's flipping up and down up and down.

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:43.479
And they're just generating, these waves are beginning to propagate out. 350 kilometers is about the distance,

00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:49.330
what, to London? Then you've got two thirty solar mass black holes sort of orbiting one another in this region

00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:51.879
And so they're going...
