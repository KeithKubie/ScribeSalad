00:00:07.846 --> 00:00:09.896
&gt;&gt;Teacher: The whole point
is that you're supposed

00:00:09.946 --> 00:00:11.256
to experiment with ideas.

00:00:11.256 --> 00:00:13.796
I would love it if you're on
the edge of what you understand.

00:00:13.796 --> 00:00:17.176
&gt;&gt;Narrator: In the 21st century
effective teachers need more

00:00:17.176 --> 00:00:19.466
than solid knowledge
of subject matter.

00:00:19.466 --> 00:00:21.216
&gt;&gt;We call it the Think-First model.

00:00:21.316 --> 00:00:23.016
&gt;&gt;Narrator: They should
know how to promote social

00:00:23.016 --> 00:00:24.336
and emotional intelligence.

00:00:24.556 --> 00:00:27.276
&gt;&gt;Teacher: When you are getting
provoked it's important to do what?

00:00:28.096 --> 00:00:30.326
&gt;&gt;Student: Size up the situation.

00:00:30.976 --> 00:00:31.166
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Good.

00:00:31.466 --> 00:00:33.756
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Be comfortable
with instructional methods

00:00:33.756 --> 00:00:34.996
like project-based learning.

00:00:34.996 --> 00:00:37.696
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Alright, looking at how
the wheel is operating right now,

00:00:37.736 --> 00:00:39.046
what might you change about it?

00:00:39.286 --> 00:00:42.166
&gt;&gt;Narrator: And keep up with
rapidly evolving technologies

00:00:42.456 --> 00:00:45.466
so they can facilitate
learning at any time and place.

00:00:45.556 --> 00:00:46.976
&gt;&gt;Student: We could
do two if we wanted.

00:00:47.376 --> 00:00:47.576
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Yeah.

00:00:47.716 --> 00:00:47.886
&gt;&gt;Student: Right?

00:00:48.106 --> 00:00:48.226
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Yep.

00:00:48.436 --> 00:00:50.986
&gt;&gt;Ada: I don't believe that
good teachers are born.

00:00:50.986 --> 00:00:54.166
I believe that we educate
people to become good teachers.

00:00:54.416 --> 00:01:00.126
But I think good teachers have to
enjoy sharing their love of learning.

00:01:00.246 --> 00:01:02.686
There has to be a passion
for learning that they want

00:01:02.686 --> 00:01:03.906
to share with young people.

00:01:03.906 --> 00:01:05.306
&gt;&gt;Teacher: This one,
do you know this one?

00:01:05.306 --> 00:01:06.296
&gt;&gt;Student: Mullein?

00:01:06.296 --> 00:01:07.166
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Right, mullein...

00:01:08.806 --> 00:01:10.656
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Schools of
education are realizing

00:01:10.656 --> 00:01:14.856
that good teachers are acting
as mentors, coaches, and guides,

00:01:15.026 --> 00:01:18.136
encouraging students to take
charge of their own education.

00:01:18.396 --> 00:01:20.036
&gt;&gt;Teacher: We want to
be careful we don't come

00:01:20.036 --> 00:01:21.776
out in the end with your DNA barcode-

00:01:22.126 --> 00:01:23.096
&gt;&gt;Narrator: High Tech High

00:01:23.096 --> 00:01:27.056
in San Diego created its own
on-campus School of Education

00:01:27.506 --> 00:01:30.616
to develop the kind of teacher
that will thrive in classrooms

00:01:30.826 --> 00:01:33.126
that feature cross-curricular
projects.

00:01:33.126 --> 00:01:36.826
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Yeah, I have them do
each this page in their table groups

00:01:36.826 --> 00:01:37.936
and I went around to
each table group-

00:01:37.936 --> 00:01:40.216
&gt;&gt;Larry: What I like to see
in a teacher is somebody

00:01:40.216 --> 00:01:43.076
who has deep content knowledge
of their subject matter.

00:01:43.076 --> 00:01:45.606
&gt;&gt;Teacher: And you want to check it
out, write down some observations,

00:01:45.606 --> 00:01:47.366
what it smells like,
what it looks like.

00:01:47.366 --> 00:01:51.296
&gt;&gt;Larry: Somebody who is passionate
about their subject matter.

00:01:51.296 --> 00:01:53.466
&gt;&gt;Jeffrey: No, no, no, I like
how it bounces back and forth.

00:01:53.466 --> 00:01:57.386
&gt;&gt;Larry: And people who are
very dynamic in their ability

00:01:57.436 --> 00:01:59.436
to infect kids' curiosity.

00:01:59.696 --> 00:02:02.686
&gt;&gt;Teacher: What is special
about this leaf that is going

00:02:02.686 --> 00:02:04.356
to help it live in the understory?

00:02:04.356 --> 00:02:08.946
&gt;&gt;Student: There's just a little bit
of light that will help it survive?

00:02:08.946 --> 00:02:11.836
&gt;&gt;Narrator: In the best teacher
preparation programs educational

00:02:11.836 --> 00:02:14.906
theory is integrated with
practical field experience,

00:02:15.196 --> 00:02:18.526
strong mentors include
professors and classroom teachers,

00:02:18.886 --> 00:02:22.256
there is ongoing support for
new teachers after graduation,

00:02:22.446 --> 00:02:25.476
and continuous self-assessment
and reflection.

00:02:25.926 --> 00:02:29.096
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Alright, this is a
silent exercise, and when it is

00:02:29.096 --> 00:02:33.106
over we'll look at what we've got
and make some comments about it.

00:02:33.106 --> 00:02:35.796
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The learning
doesn't stop with a credential.

00:02:36.016 --> 00:02:38.826
Professional development
programs play a critical role

00:02:38.826 --> 00:02:40.676
in creating successful teachers,

00:02:40.876 --> 00:02:43.756
especially during the first
five years of teaching.

00:02:43.866 --> 00:02:44.916
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Have you all
been doing the reading

00:02:44.916 --> 00:02:45.856
or just watching the video?

00:02:45.976 --> 00:02:46.706
Joseph?

00:02:46.706 --> 00:02:49.676
&gt;&gt;Narrator: At Yes Prep in
Houston, Texas a full time dean

00:02:49.676 --> 00:02:52.946
of instruction does periodic
classroom observations

00:02:53.026 --> 00:02:56.236
and gives feedback to veterans
and new teachers alike.

00:02:56.236 --> 00:02:59.396
&gt;&gt;Michelle: And we have a pretty
intensive rubric that we use so I go

00:02:59.396 --> 00:03:03.716
into every classroom
approximately five times a year.

00:03:03.716 --> 00:03:06.766
The majority of my time is spent
observing then debriefing with them.

00:03:06.806 --> 00:03:08.976
And then after we talk
about high expectations

00:03:08.976 --> 00:03:13.176
for this particular lesson then we'll
go into student-center classroom.

00:03:13.176 --> 00:03:14.806
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Teachers
who are well-prepared

00:03:14.806 --> 00:03:16.646
and trained stay on the job longer.

00:03:16.646 --> 00:03:20.026
They have the ability to
fully engage their students.

00:03:20.136 --> 00:03:23.326
They model social and emotional
intelligence and are able

00:03:23.326 --> 00:03:27.126
to provide an invaluable human
touch that can make a difference

00:03:27.126 --> 00:03:28.416
in their students' lives.

00:03:28.416 --> 00:03:29.886
&gt;&gt;Teacher: What's that letter?

00:03:29.886 --> 00:03:30.036
&gt;&gt;Student: "E".

00:03:30.036 --> 00:03:32.186
&gt;&gt;What's that letter?

00:03:32.186 --> 00:03:32.586
&gt;&gt;Student: "N".

00:03:32.586 --> 00:03:34.976
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Look how smart you are;
you're so smart I can't even take it.
