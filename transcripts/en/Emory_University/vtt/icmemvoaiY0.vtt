had improved

a little piece of--
kernel of evidence that,

okay, tango, interesting.

00:15:41.907 --> 00:15:43.142 line:71%
<i> And then there was another
 piece of evidence</i>

00:15:43.242 --> 00:15:44.443 line:71%

 Dr. Hackney's first</i>

<i> pilot study on tango for
 Parkinson's patients</i>

00:16:04.897 --> 00:16:06.465 line:71%

<i> safe yet hopefully effective.</i>

00:16:12.504 --> 00:16:13.472 line:71%
<i> (Dr. Hackney)
 First of all, we looked at</i>

00:16:13.572 --> 00:16:16.475 line:71%
<i> 20 hours of tango
 over a 12-week period</i>

00:16:16.575 --> 00:16:20.212 line:71%

00:16:20.312 --> 00:16:22.982 line:71%
<i> which is the traditional class
 that was offered at the time.</i>

00:16:23.082 --> 00:16:26.285 line:71%
<i> Improved balance
 and gait parameters,</i>

00:16:26.385 --> 00:16:28.554 line:71%
<i> so it improved
 balance and walking.</i>

00:16:28.654 --> 00:16:29.922 line:0%
<i> (Jaye)
 Hackney's study showed that</i>

00:16:30.022 --> 00:16:33.258 line:0%
<i> after the class, tango dancers
 with Parkinson's</i>

00:16:33.359 --> 00:16:36.628 line:0%
<i> were able to walk further,
 faster, and longer</i>

00:16:36.729 --> 00:16:38.197 line:0%

<i> Standard clinical motor exams

00:16:45.871 --> 00:16:47.639 line:57%
So, does it have to
be tango?

00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:50.476 line:57%
Well, Hackney says that
the fox trot and the waltz

00:16:50.576 --> 00:16:53.812 line:57%
are just as effective,
with one difference...

00:16:53.912 --> 00:16:55.080 line:57%
this.
Tango patients were able

00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:57.282 line:57%
to get up from
a chair and walk

00:16:57.383 --> 00:16:58.917 line:57%
more easily
and quickly.

00:16:59.018 --> 00:17:01.286 line:71%
That is no small feat
in a disease

marked by mobility issues.

<i> Hackney says the improvisation
 that tango allows</i>

00:17:07.426 --> 00:17:10.562 line:71%
<i> is another plus
 for patients.</i>

<i> There is no definitive answer
 yet, but Hackney thinks</i>

00:17:27.613 --> 00:17:31.316 line:71%
<i> the findings will confirm
 what she believes.</i>

00:17:31.417 --> 00:17:32.618 line:71%
<i> (Dr. Hackney)
 Dance itself is a form of</i>

<i> When people dance,

00:17:36.755 --> 00:17:37.923 line:71%
<i> especially in the tango,
 they have to</i>

00:17:38.023 --> 00:17:41.560 line:71%
<i> use their brains in a very,
 very particular way.</i>

00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:42.895 line:71%
They have to
remember things.

00:17:42.995 --> 00:17:44.296 line:71%
They have to
understand timing.

00:17:44.396 --> 00:17:47.266 line:71%
They have to understand
how to put a movement to music,

00:17:47.366 --> 00:17:49.968 line:71%
and it, in a way, it's
a form of cognitive training.

00:17:50.069 --> 00:17:53.972 line:71%
And I think, if we can see that
on-- in our brain,

00:17:54.073 --> 00:17:55.574 line:71%
that'd be really cool.

Now, to something
all of us do

and probably rarely
consider: blinking.

00:19:39.178 --> 00:19:40.212 line:71%
Scientists say we blink

00:19:40.312 --> 00:19:43.515 line:71%
on average 15 to 20 times
per minute.

00:19:43.615 --> 00:19:45.751 line:71%

and 28,800 times per day.

00:19:49.254 --> 00:19:51.723 line:71%
But, for thousands of people,
the blinking gets

00:19:51.823 --> 00:19:55.694 line:71%
out of control, leaving them

<i> Emory Brain Health's

00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:32.190 line:57%
In blepharospasm, the muscles
surrounding the eyes

00:21:32.291 --> 00:21:34.259 line:57%
are over-contracting,
so they are doing

00:21:34.359 --> 00:21:36.161 line:57%
more than they should,
but the problem

00:21:36.261 --> 00:21:37.963 line:57%
is not in the muscles.
The problem is actually

00:21:38.063 --> 00:21:41.433 line:57%
in the brain's way of
controlling your blinking.

00:21:41.533 --> 00:21:44.936 line:71%
<i> Somewhere along the line,
 the brain sends signals</i>

00:21:45.037 --> 00:21:47.139 line:71%
<i> for your blinking
 that are too much.</i>

00:21:47.239 --> 00:21:49.274 line:71%
<i> They're too exaggerated
 in some way,</i>

00:21:49.374 --> 00:21:52.511 line:71%

you spasm, uh,

00:21:52.611 --> 00:21:54.446 line:71%
and your eyes may blink closed,
and they don't

00:21:54.546 --> 00:21:57.949 line:71%

00:22:49.568 --> 00:22:52.471 line:57%
<i> Nilda remembers when
 he told her the treatment.</i>

00:22:52.571 --> 00:22:57.376 line:68%
And he said, "Well,
you get, uh, injections
around your eyes,"

00:22:57.476 --> 00:22:59.778 line:71%
and I said,
"That's the good news?"

00:22:59.878 --> 00:23:01.947 line:71%
The treatment
is botulinum toxin,

00:23:02.047 --> 00:23:05.917 line:71%
and the way it works
is by, um, getting into

00:23:06.017 --> 00:23:08.620 line:71%
the areas where the nerves
control the muscles,

00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:11.590 line:71%
and what it does is,
it slows the nerves down.

00:23:11.690 --> 00:23:13.392 line:71%
It doesn't really
paralyze them.

00:23:13.492 --> 00:23:16.194 line:57%
Um, it slows them down
so that their communication

00:23:16.294 --> 00:23:19.531 line:57%
<i> with the muscles they control
 is less forceful, if you will.</i>

<i> (knocking)</i>

<i> Um, that's a little
 bit simplified,</i>

00:23:26.338 --> 00:23:27.706 line:71%
<i> but that's really
 what it's doing.</i>

00:23:27.806 --> 00:23:31.777 line:71%

 the overactive muscles.</i>

 closed most of the time</i>

00:23:47.426 --> 00:23:49.661 line:57%
She has also a feature
of blepharospasm

00:23:49.761 --> 00:23:52.330 line:57%
that maybe only 10%
of the patients have,

00:23:52.431 --> 00:23:55.233 line:57%
and that's called
apraxia of eyelid opening.

00:23:55.333 --> 00:23:58.503 line:71%
The eyes close, and then they
won't open by themselves,

00:23:58.603 --> 00:24:00.605 line:71%
and the reason for that is
because there's a spasm

00:24:00.705 --> 00:24:02.474 line:71%
in the skinny muscle
of your eyelid

00:24:02.574 --> 00:24:03.708 line:71%
that goes
right across here,

00:24:03.809 --> 00:24:06.344 line:71%
and if that spasms
while the eyes are closed,

00:24:06.445 --> 00:24:08.580 line:71%
it can't roll up
over your eyeball.
