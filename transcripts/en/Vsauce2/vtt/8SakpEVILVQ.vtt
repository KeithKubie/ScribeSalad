00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.870
The Toto Apricot is a fancy toilet with an
automatic lifting seat, bidet, and deodorizer,

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:08.412
and some models even feature an mp3 player...

00:00:08.412 --> 00:00:09.412
What The Fak.

00:00:09.412 --> 00:00:10.412
The Facts And Knowledge on Future Toilets.

00:00:10.412 --> 00:00:18.990
The 
Kohler Numi Bidet Toilet features a foot warmer,

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.890
heated seat, and built-in music system.

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.860
It's all controlled with a touch screen remote
and runs for about $6,300 dollars.

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:31.780
The Clean Seat is a hygienic way to cover
a public toilet seat in paper by automatically

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:35.820
pulling down and placing it for you, and disposing
of it.

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.360
And this CWS rotating seat self-cleans by
spinning the entire thing through this module

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.530
that sanitizes and dries it before retracting
back into place.

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.820
For high-tech toilet privacy, these stalls
at Bar 89 in New York City fog up when they're

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:51.900
occupied.

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:57.760
Here's a homemade Steampunk toilet with antique
gauges and even a laser-pointing mechanism.

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.940
The Ultimate Clean Toilet concept features
a two-in-one toilet that swivels into a urinal.

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.240
It also self-santizes with steam and UV.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:12.150
The all-in-one concept goes one step further
by integrating a sink that uses water runoff

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.799
to fill the tank and flush the toilet.

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:18.500
However, these innovative concepts still rely
on old flush technology.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.540
So, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation
is funding research to re-invent the toilet,

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:28.240
because 40% of the world still lives without
a safe way to remove their excrement, and

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.229
we're using water and sewer technology that's
basically two hundred years old.

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:36.260
They aim to create low-cost toilets that safely
recycle the waste.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:41.189
Virginia Gardiner created this plumbing-free
toilet that's literally made out of poop.

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.560
Her waterless toilet design seals the waste
in a cartidge which is then transported to

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.580
an anaerobic digester that recycles the methane
gas.

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:55.360
Outdoor urinals are gaining popularity around
the world, including these in Sydney, Australia.

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.790
And now for a couple of bathroom myths:

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:01.009
Airplanes do not drop toilet waste from the
sky.

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:05.479
The waste is collected in a secure holding
tank that is emptied after it lands.

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:08.990
Leaks have been known to happen, which cause
the waste to freeze on the exterior of the

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:12.470
plane and fall off in clumps known as Blue
Ice.

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:13.819
But it's rare.

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:17.420
Water does not drain opposite directions depending
on the Hemisphere.

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.840
The Coriolis Effect does cause macroevents,
like hurricanes, to rotate clockwise in the

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.530
Southern Hemisphere and counterclockwise in
the Northern, but it's effect is insignificant

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.730
when it comes to microevents like bathwater
draining or toilet flushes.

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.340
I'm gonna leave you with this guy.

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.480
Who is he and what notable invention did he
develop?

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.170
Before we go here's last video's winner.

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:42.480
And, as always, thanks for watching.
