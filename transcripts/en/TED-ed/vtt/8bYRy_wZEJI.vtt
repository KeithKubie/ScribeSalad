00:00:06.728 --> 00:00:10.121
Three and a half thousand years ago in Egypt,

00:00:10.121 --> 00:00:14.426
a noble pharaoh was the victim 
of a violent attack.

00:00:14.426 --> 00:00:16.453
But the attack was not physical.

00:00:16.453 --> 00:00:19.729
This royal had been dead for 20 years.

00:00:19.729 --> 00:00:21.884
The attack was historical,

00:00:21.884 --> 00:00:26.834
an act of damnatio memoriae,
the damnation of memory.

00:00:26.834 --> 00:00:29.559
Somebody smashed the pharaoh's statues,

00:00:29.559 --> 00:00:35.501
took a chisel and attempted to erase 
the pharaoh's name and image from history.

00:00:35.501 --> 00:00:39.420
Who was this pharaoh,
and what was behind the attack?

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:40.831
Here's the key:

00:00:40.831 --> 00:00:44.482
the pharaoh Hatshepsut was a woman.

00:00:44.482 --> 00:00:48.213
In the normal course of things,
she should never have been pharaoh.

00:00:48.213 --> 00:00:50.783
Although it was legal 
for a woman to be a monarch,

00:00:50.783 --> 00:00:54.249
it disturbed some essential Egyptian beliefs.

00:00:54.249 --> 00:00:57.525
Firstly, the pharaoh was known
as the living embodiment

00:00:57.525 --> 00:01:00.412
of the male god Horus.

00:01:00.412 --> 00:01:04.208
Secondly, disturbance to the tradition
of rule by men

00:01:04.208 --> 00:01:07.323
was a serious challenge to Maat,

00:01:07.323 --> 00:01:11.788
a word for "truth," 
expressing a belief in order and justice,

00:01:11.788 --> 00:01:13.710
vital to the Egyptians.

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.056
Hatshepsut had perhaps tried to adapt

00:01:16.056 --> 00:01:20.809
to this belief in the link between 
order and patriarchy through her titles.

00:01:20.809 --> 00:01:22.446
She took the name Maatkare,

00:01:22.446 --> 00:01:24.549
and sometimes referred to herself

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:28.132
as Hatshepsu, 
with a masculine word ending.

00:01:28.132 --> 00:01:31.756
But apparently, these efforts 
didn't convince everyone,

00:01:31.756 --> 00:01:34.329
and perhaps someone 
erased Hatshepsut's image

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:37.665
so that the world would forget 
the disturbance to Maat,

00:01:37.665 --> 00:01:40.788
and Egypt could be balanced again.

00:01:40.788 --> 00:01:44.573
Hatshepsut, moreover, 
was not the legitimate heir to the thrown,

00:01:44.573 --> 00:01:48.229
but a regent, 
a kind of stand-in co-monarch.

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:51.989
The Egyptian kingship traditionally 
passed from father to son.

00:01:51.989 --> 00:01:56.002
It passed from Thutmose I 
to his son Thutmose II,

00:01:56.002 --> 00:01:57.831
Hatshepsut's husband.

00:01:57.831 --> 00:02:02.709
It should have passed from Thutmose II 
directly to his son Thutmose III,

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:06.663
but Thutmose III was a little boy 
when his father died.

00:02:06.663 --> 00:02:10.061
Hatshepsut, the dead pharaoh's chief wife and widow,

00:02:10.061 --> 00:02:13.374
stepped in to help 
as her stepson's regent

00:02:13.374 --> 00:02:18.027
but ended up ruling beside him 
as a fully fledged pharaoh.

00:02:18.027 --> 00:02:20.722
Perhaps Thutmose III was angry about this.

00:02:20.722 --> 00:02:23.836
Perhaps he was the one 
who erased her images.

00:02:23.836 --> 00:02:26.887
It's also possible that someone wanted 
to dishonor Hatshepsut

00:02:26.887 --> 00:02:28.980
because she was a bad pharaoh.

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.413
But the evidence suggests 
she was actually pretty good.

00:02:32.413 --> 00:02:35.591
She competently fulfilled 
the traditional roles of the office.

00:02:35.591 --> 00:02:37.100
She was a great builder.

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.959
Her mortuary temple, Djeser-Djeseru,

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:42.600
was an architectural phenomenon 
at the time

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.583
and is still admired today.

00:02:44.583 --> 00:02:46.772
She enhanced the economy of Egypt,

00:02:46.772 --> 00:02:51.745
conducting a very successful trade mission
to the distant land of Punt.

00:02:51.745 --> 00:02:53.765
She had strong religious connections.

00:02:53.765 --> 00:02:57.657
She even claimed to be the daughter 
of the state god, Amun.

00:02:57.657 --> 00:03:02.055
And she had a successful military career,
with a Nubian campaign,

00:03:02.055 --> 00:03:06.136
and claims she fought alongside 
her soldiers in battle.

00:03:06.136 --> 00:03:09.794
Of course, we have to be careful
when we assess the success

00:03:09.794 --> 00:03:11.210
of Hatshepsut's career,

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:15.161
since most of the evidence 
was written by Hatshepsut herself.

00:03:15.161 --> 00:03:18.083
She tells her own story 
in pictures and writing

00:03:18.083 --> 00:03:20.325
on the walls of her mortuary temple

00:03:20.325 --> 00:03:23.439
and the red chapel she built for Amun.

00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:27.228
So who committed the crimes 
against Hatshepsut's memory?

00:03:27.228 --> 00:03:32.838
The most popular suspect is 
her stepson, nephew and co-ruler, Thutmose III.

00:03:32.838 --> 00:03:35.961
Did he do it out of anger 
because she stole his throne?

00:03:35.961 --> 00:03:38.587
This is unlikely since 
the damage wasn't done

00:03:38.587 --> 00:03:41.735
until 20 years after Hatshepsut died.

00:03:41.735 --> 00:03:46.134
That's a long time to hang onto anger 
and then act in a rage.

00:03:46.134 --> 00:03:49.471
Maybe Thutmose III did it 
to make his own reign look stronger.

00:03:49.471 --> 00:03:53.521
But it is most likely that 
he or someone else erased the images

00:03:53.521 --> 00:03:58.591
so that people would forget 
that a woman ever sat on Egypt's throne.

00:03:58.591 --> 00:04:02.703
This gender anomaly was simply 
too much of a threat to Maat

00:04:02.703 --> 00:04:05.786
and had to be obliterated from history.

00:04:05.786 --> 00:04:09.730
Happily, the ancient censors 
were not quite thorough enough.

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:13.173
Enough evidence survived for us 
to piece together what happened,

00:04:13.173 --> 00:04:17.412
so the story of this unique powerful woman
can now be told.
