00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.269
What Size was Marilyn Monroe?

00:00:04.269 --> 00:00:08.309
From Roseanne Barr stating, “I’m more
sexy than Pamela Lee or whoever else they’ve

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:09.660
got out there these days.

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.980
Marilyn Monroe was a size 16.

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:16.340
That says it all”, to Elizabeth Hurley stating,
“I’ve always thought Marilyn Monroe looked

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.840
fabulous, but I’d kill myself if I was that
fat…”, you’ll often hear people saying

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:26.050
Marilyn Monroe was around the same size as
the average American woman today (12-16).

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:31.270
In fact, nothing could be further from the
truth, at least by today’s sizing systems.

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:34.130
How this myth got started isn’t exactly
known.

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:39.230
One possible contributing factor to this myth
was Marilyn Monroe’s rare extreme hour glass

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:40.310
shape.

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:44.460
More directly, it probably partially stems
from the fact that women’s sizes today are

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.140
not at all equivalent to women’s sizes in
the 1950s.

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:53.510
In the 1980s, in order to accommodate people’s
vanity and ever expanding girth, the U.S.

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:58.090
Department of Commerce got rid of the uniform
sizing system and instead allowed for more

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:59.960
ego stroking sizes.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:06.450
As a result of this, today, a size 8 would
have been roughly equivalent to a size 16-18

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.369
in the 1950s, obviously though this varies
a shocking amount from brand to brand.

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.560
So what size was Marilyn Monroe really?

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.579
Luckily, many of her dresses, carefully preserved,
are still around to measure off of.

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:24.259
Further, one of her dress makers also chimed
in with exact measurements he took.

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:31.890
Those measurements were 5 ft. 5.5 inches tall;
35 inch bust; 22 inch waist; and 35 inch hips,

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.609
with a bra size of 36D.

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:38.619
Her weight fluctuated a bit through her career,
usually rising in times of depression and

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:44.430
falling back to her normal thereafter, but
her dressmaker listed her as 118 pounds and

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.719
the Hollywood studios tended to list her between
115-120 lbs.

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:54.200
As to what size Marilyn Monroe would be in
women’s sizes today, that’s not an easy

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.890
thing to answer due to the differing sizes
from brand to brand, country to country, and

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.869
the fact that her extreme hour glass shape
would have made it difficult for her to find

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:05.320
the perfect size while clothes shopping.

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:10.769
Lucky for her, she could afford to have her
clothing custom made, which she usually did.

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:15.349
As a direct example of her size, the white
dress she wore in The Seven Year Itch was

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:20.470
recently auctioned off and was put on a mannequin
that was a size 2, but they were still unable

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.530
to zip up the dress as the mannequin was too
big.

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.511
Many of her other dresses that exist from
throughout her career match up to about the

00:02:27.511 --> 00:02:30.080
same, give or take an inch or two.

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.319
That being said, Marilyn Monroe at times would
have her dresses so tight they’d have to

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:39.629
be sown onto her, so something more comfortable
in a size 4-ish (American) and something like

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:43.300
an 8 in the U.K. is probably more accurate
with many brands.

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:48.220
If you’re curious as to how that compares
to modern contemporary fashion models, according

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:53.990
to BluFire Model Registry, models are generally
in the vicinity of a 34 inch bust; 24 inch

00:02:53.990 --> 00:03:02.020
waist; and 34 inch hips, which is very close
to Monroe’s measurements of 35-22-35.

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:08.680
They also list the average model today at
5 ft. 8 inches, to Monroe’s 5 ft 5.5 inches.

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.349
Elizabeth Hurley, who in the above quote called
Marilyn Monroe fat, actually has around the

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:19.410
same dimensions: 34-24-34, though is about
5 inches taller than Monroe was.

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:24.480
So while it’s often rightly lamented that
female models and actresses today set a standard

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:29.080
that few can realistically live up to, the
same was true in the Marilyn Monroe era, minus

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:33.409
Photoshop, even though she’s often used
today as an example of how things were different

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:35.060
“back in the day”.

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:38.379
Probably the perception of the difference
between then and now lies more in the fact

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:41.000
that the average American is a lot bigger
today.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.140
To this point, the average American woman
in the 1950s had a 25 inch waist compared

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.409
to Monroe’s 22 inches.

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:53.159
Whereas today, the average American woman
has a waist size of 34 inches, so the gap

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:57.120
between the models and “average” was much
less pronounced then.

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.709
And, of course, today we have more advanced
means of photo and video editing to make the

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:07.290
gap seem even larger, with the edited results
being truly unattainable, even by the models

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.470
and actresses themselves.

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:12.560
Bonus Fact:
• Another Marilyn Monroe myth was that she

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:13.560
was a blonde.

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:18.590
In fact, the actress famed for her platinum
blond curls actually was a dark haired brunette.

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:22.390
She first dyed her hair blonde after being
told that models with lighter colored hair

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:26.890
were preferable, so bleached it to golden
blonde and later adjusted this a total of

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:43.210
nine times until she settled on platinum blonde.
