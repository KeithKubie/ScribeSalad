if you think about it who would have
 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.470
if you think about it who would have
predicted that a high frequency

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480
predicted that a high frequency
 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.950
predicted that a high frequency
amplifier would be useful for eye

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960
amplifier would be useful for eye
 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.320
amplifier would be useful for eye
surgery high frequency amplifier was

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330
surgery high frequency amplifier was
 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.240

what Charlie towns was trying to build

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250
what Charlie towns was trying to build
 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.029
what Charlie towns was trying to build
when he built the Mesa and that ended up

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039
when he built the Mesa and that ended up
 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:18.620
when he built the Mesa and that ended up
as the laser and now is used in eye

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630
as the laser and now is used in eye
 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.099
as the laser and now is used in eye
surgery and also in sort of supermarket

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109
surgery and also in sort of supermarket
 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.679
surgery and also in sort of supermarket
checkouts and barcode recognition and

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689
checkouts and barcode recognition and
 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.919
checkouts and barcode recognition and
you name it in lots of areas of science

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:29.929
you name it in lots of areas of science
 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:33.620
you name it in lots of areas of science
who would have thought that doing radio

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630
who would have thought that doing radio
 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.090
who would have thought that doing radio
astronomy would lead to an experiment

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100
astronomy would lead to an experiment
 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.180
astronomy would lead to an experiment
that produced a breakthrough in organic

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190
that produced a breakthrough in organic
 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.080
that produced a breakthrough in organic
in organic chemistry so I'm my

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090
in organic chemistry so I'm my
 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.260

wow this is interesting this is a puzzle

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430
wow this is interesting this is a puzzle
 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.610
wow this is interesting this is a puzzle
let's just follow it and see where it

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620
let's just follow it and see where it
 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.389
let's just follow it and see where it
leads and it leads to totally unexpected

00:00:55.389 --> 00:00:55.399
leads and it leads to totally unexpected
 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:01:00.680
leads and it leads to totally unexpected
places by and large and so I that's my

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690
places by and large and so I that's my
 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.500
places by and large and so I that's my
science that's what I seem to be better

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510
science that's what I seem to be better
 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.359
science that's what I seem to be better
at than other things and and I don't

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369
at than other things and and I don't
 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.550
at than other things and and I don't
really have a feeling other than to make

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560
really have a feeling other than to make
 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.399
really have a feeling other than to make
some small break through which interests

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409
some small break through which interests
 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.840
some small break through which interests
me and so I'm not good at answering

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850
me and so I'm not good at answering
 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.850
me and so I'm not good at answering
foretelling the future but then not many

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860
foretelling the future but then not many
 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.670
foretelling the future but then not many
people are actually
