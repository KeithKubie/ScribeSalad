00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.840
We never know when we might have
to do a little bit more party

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:04.630
planning.

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:07.370
So it doesn't hurt to
have some practice.

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:09.580
And that's what this
exercise is doing for us,

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:11.480
is generating
problems so that we

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:15.279
can try solving systems of
equations with elimination.

00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:16.820
And so in this first
problem, it says

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.016
solve for x and y
using elimination.

00:00:19.016 --> 00:00:20.390
And then this is
what they have--

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:23.170
6x minus 6y is equal
to negative 24.

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:25.900
Negative 5x minus 5y is
equal to negative 60.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.300
So let me get my scratch
pad out to solve this.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.710
Let me rewrite it.

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:39.580
So they gave us 6x minus
6y is equal to negative 24.

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:47.097
And negative 5x minus 5y
is equal to negative 60.

00:00:47.097 --> 00:00:48.680
So what we have to
think about, and we

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.620
saw this in several
of the other videos,

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.720
is when we want to
eliminate a variable,

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.730
we want to manipulate
these two equations.

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:56.840
And if we were to add
the corresponding sides,

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.960
that variable might disappear.

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.740
So if we just added a
6x to a negative 5x,

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:03.180
that's not going
to cancel it out.

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.390
If this was a negative
6x, that would work out.

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.710
Or if this was a positive
5x, that would work out.

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.490
But this isn't exactly right.

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:11.550
So if I want to
eliminate the x, I

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.160
have to manipulate these
equations so that these two

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:15.949
characters might cancel out.

00:01:15.949 --> 00:01:17.490
And one thing that
pops into my brain

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:18.906
is it looks like
all of this stuff

00:01:18.906 --> 00:01:21.100
up here is divisible by
6, and all of this stuff

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:22.812
down here is divisible by 5.

00:01:22.812 --> 00:01:25.020
And if we were to divide
all this stuff up here by 6,

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.930
we'd be left with
an x over here.

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.530
And if we were to divide
all this bottom stuff by 5,

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.700
we'd be left with a
negative x right over here.

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.790
And then they just
might cancel out.

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:35.390
So let's try that out.

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:36.970
Let's take this first equation.

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:41.040
And we're going to
multiply both sides by 1/6.

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.790
Or another way you
could think about it is

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:45.950
we're dividing both sides by 6.

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.800
And as long as we do the
same thing to both sides,

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.105
the equation holds.

00:01:50.105 --> 00:01:51.970
The equality holds.

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:55.370
So if you multiply everything
by 1/6, 6x times 1/6

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:57.270
is just going to be x.

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.440
6y times 1/6 is just y.

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:03.160
So it's negative y.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.150
Negative 24 times
1/6 is negative 4.

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.720
Or you could just view it
as negative 24 divided by 6

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:10.840
is negative 4.

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.110
So this equation, the blue one,
we've simplified as x minus y

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:15.670
is equal to negative 4.

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.150
Let's do something similar
with the second one.

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.750
Here we could say we're going to
multiply everything times 1/5.

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.750
Or you could say that we're
dividing everything by 5.

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.310
If we do that, negative
5x divided by 5

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.910
is just negative x.

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.980
Negative 5y divided
by 5 is negative y.

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:40.120
And then negative 60
divided by 5 is negative 12.

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.830
And now, this looks
pretty interesting.

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.525
If we add the two left-hand
sides-- and remember,

00:02:46.525 --> 00:02:48.650
we can keep the equality,
because we're essentially

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.160
adding the same
thing to both sides.

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.540
You can imagine we're starting
with the blue equation.

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.840
And on the left-hand side,
we're adding negative x minus y.

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.300
And on the right-hand side,
we're adding negative 12.

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.190
But the second equation tells
us that those two things

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.916
are equal.

00:03:01.916 --> 00:03:03.290
So we're doing
the same principle

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:06.090
that we saw when we first
started looking to algebra,

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.280
that you can maintain your
equality as long as you

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:09.272
add the same thing.

00:03:09.272 --> 00:03:11.230
On the left-hand side,
we're going to add this.

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.396
And on the right-hand side,
we're going to add this.

00:03:13.396 --> 00:03:14.980
But this second
equation tells us

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:16.380
that those two things are equal.

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.540
So we can maintain our equality.

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:19.310
So let's do that.

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.045
What do we get on
the left-hand side?

00:03:21.045 --> 00:03:22.920
Well, you have a positive
x and a negative x.

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.050
They cancel out.

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:27.030
That was the whole point behind
manipulating them in this way.

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.910
And then you have negative y
minus y, which is negative 2y.

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.130
And then on the right-hand
side, you have negative 4

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:36.894
minus 12, which is negative 16.

00:03:36.894 --> 00:03:38.810
And these are going to
be equal to each other.

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.130
Once again, we're adding the
same thing to both sides.

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:47.330
To solve for y, we can divide
both sides by negative 2.

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:51.990
And we are left with y
is equal to positive 8.

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:53.480
But we are not done yet.

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.654
We want to go and substitute
back into one of the equations.

00:03:56.654 --> 00:03:58.320
And we can substitute
back into this one

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.650
and to this one, or
this one and this one.

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:03.060
The solutions need to satisfy
all of these essentially.

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.474
This blue one is another way of
expressing this blue equation.

00:04:06.474 --> 00:04:07.890
This green equation
is another way

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:09.700
of expressing this
green equation.

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.340
So I'll go for whichever one
seems to be the simplest.

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:15.250
And this one seems to be
pretty simple right over here.

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:21.180
So let's take x
minus y-- we just

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:26.075
solved that y would be positive
8-- is equal to negative 4.

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:35.810
And now to solve for x, we just
have to add 8 to both sides.

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:37.910
And we are left with,
on the left-hand side,

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:39.540
negative 8 plus 8 cancels out.

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:41.000
You're just left with an x.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.950
And negative 4 plus 8
is equal to positive 4.

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:49.939
So you get x is equal
to 4, y is equal to 8.

00:04:49.939 --> 00:04:51.480
And you can verify
that it would work

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:53.430
with either one of
these equations.

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:58.670
6 times 4 is 24 minus 6 times
8-- so it's 24 minus 48--

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:00.810
is, indeed, negative 24.

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:06.160
Negative 5 times 4 is negative
20, minus negative 40,

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:09.100
if y is equal to 8, does,
indeed, get you negative 60.

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:10.900
So it works out
for both of these.

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.370
And we can try it out by
inputting our answers.

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:15.130
So x is 4, y is 8.

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:17.000
So let's do that.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.300
So let me type this in.

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:22.180
x is going to be equal to 4.

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:24.460
y is going to be equal to 8.

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:26.730
And let's check our answer.

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:28.680
It is correct.

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.390
Very good.
