Speaker 1:          00:01          We finished black boy last time and one of the big questions coming out of my discussion of that autobiography is how do you manage the question of context and reading a novel, a or an autobiography in reading any texts. And we had a very complex publishing history to think about, um, with that text. Flannery O'connor's work raises questions of a similar kind, but they look very different. And so my, um, my lectures on Flannery O'connor, we'll highlight the methodologies that we can bring to any reading of a novel, um, and it will highlight the differences between different methodologies and what they allow us to see in a different texts.

Speaker 2:          00:49          Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:50          Flannery O'connor, as most of you probably know, is a southern writer. Um, she's very often assimilated to a whole group of southern writers who were working in the 1930s and forties. The southern Agrarians. Um, she was friends with a lot of the major figures of that movement, especially Allen Tate and, um, Carolyn, uh, Gordon, she, uh, lived out her life mostly in a small town called Milledgeville, Georgia. She was born in Savannah in 1925. Um, she studied writing at the Iowa writer's workshop. She lived in New York for a short time, but she was afflicted with Lupus, a very serious illness and she died at the age of 39 and 1964 so she lived a pretty short life. Um, over the course of that life, she wrote mostly short stories and so she's very much known for her short stories. Um, she has a couple of novels of them. This is, I think the most successful,

Speaker 2:          01:52          uh,

Speaker 1:          01:55          oh Connor, you may also know has been understood as a religious writer. She was a Catholic and she very much made her Catholicism at the center of all the things that she said about her fictional practice. And so we're going to see a couple of those things. Uh, uh, today. Let's look just to begin with, if you brought your books, um, well actually let's look at the cover of this book. What does this cover say to you? What does this image remind you of? What does it look like to you want to answer that part? It's the sacred heart. Yes. It's the sacred heart of Jesus in, in Catholic iconography of a certain kind of the figure of Christ is shown, usually partying his clothes and his flesh and showing you his sacred heart, which is usually crowned with flame and often, um, encircled with thorns.

Speaker 1:          03:06          So it's an image of Christ, the suffering Godhead, the very human fleshly person who will part his own flesh in order to connect with in order to redeem, um, the, the believer. So right in the packaging of this novel that we have today, this cover has changed over time. Um, nevertheless, even today, that very Catholic iconography is right on the front of the cover. And when you see why his blood, that title right below the sacred heart, you can't help but think of, well, this is blood is somehow the blood of Christ. That's the kind of blood we're talking about. It's already entered a sort of metaphorical register religious register in the way this book is packaged. Then when we open up the front, we see the author's note to the second edition and this was something O'Connor added to the novel, uh, in 1962. I just want to read that with you today.

Speaker 1:          04:19          She says, why is blood has reached the age of 10 and is still alive? My critical powers are just sufficient to determine this and I am gratified to be able to say it. The book was written with Zest and if possible it should be read that way. It is a comic novel about a Christian Mal Gray Louie and as such very serious for all comic novels that are any good must be about matters of life and death. Wise blood was written by an author, congenitally innocent of theory, but one with certain preoccupations. That belief in Christ is to some a matter of life and death has been a stumbling block for readers who would prefer to think it a matter of no great consequence for them. Hazel motes integrity lies in his trying with such vigor to get rid of the ragged figure who moves from tree to tree in the back of his mind. For the author Hazel's integrity lies in his not being able to do so. So right up front we are told that Hazel motes is a Christian in spite of himself. That this is how we are to understand this character who we will come to know.

Speaker 1:          05:37          I also want to sort of give another layer to this understanding of O'connor as a religious writer by looking at what she said in her car respondence to one of her readers who asked her some questions. And this is on the handout that I passed around. This is a letter to a man named Ben Griffith from 1954. So she had just finished wise blood and people are starting to read it, ask her questions. She was a prolific correspondence. She was very generous in her letter writing. She would write to almost anyone who wrote to her. She would write back in a substantive way. Um, I think it's in part that I'm suffering from Lupus. She was very much confined to her house in Georgia and the letter writing, this kind of correspondence was certainly way for her to keep in contact, um, with the, with the world of readers and, and other writers and friends. So he had written to her, um, he was teaching writing at a local, uh, college.

Speaker 1:          06:44          He's obviously been asking her about the sources of some of the images and characters and themes in wise blood. So I want to point out a couple of things. This is the first full paragraph. I don't know how to cure the sore situs except to tell you that I can discover a good many possible sources myself for wise blood. But I am often embarrassed to find that I read the sources, I read the sources after I had written the book. I have been exposed to Wordsworth's intimation owed. But that is all I can say about it. I have one of those food chopper brains that nothing comes out of the way it went in. The Oedipus business comes nearer to home. Of course, haze. Motes is not an Oedipus figure, but there are obvious resemblances at the time I was writing the last of the book, I was living in Connecticut, actually very close here at Yale and uh, one of the, uh, people who is still at Yale, Penny Laurans, I don't know if you've met her, she's someone who, who knew, uh, she was married to Robert Fitzgerald and she knew Flannery O'connor.

Speaker 1:          07:50          Um, uh, when I was living in Connecticut with the Robert Fitzgerald's, Robert Fitzgerald translated the Fiba and cycle and cycle with Dudley fits in the translation of Oedipus rex had just come out and I was much taken with it. Um, anyway, all I can say is I did a lot of thinking about Oedipus. This is very typical in tone for O'connor when she talks about education or learning. And if you read more in this letter, I won't go through the whole thing. Um, you will see that she's very self deprecating. She says she has what passes for an education in this day and age. She says that she's read a little bit of Kafka and doesn't know what to make of him, but it makes you a bolder writer. She reads a little Henry James Cause she thinks that makes her a better writer somehow, but she doesn't quite know how.

Speaker 1:          08:38          There's always this veneer of innocence or lack of learning or lack of sophistication. Um, so she's presenting herself as a simple person. I think that's important, although not directly connected to her presentation of herself as a Catholic person. I think it does factor into her sense that the truth she is accessing or the truth that she is trying to present to the world in her stories is one that uh, even a child might be able to understand that that fits very comfortably within a new testament understanding of the teaching of Christ. So Christ is that one to whom the little children can come. And I think she cultivates that, uh, that childlike sense in herself presentation. But then there's this very explicit discussion of her Catholicism. Little further down my background and my inclinations are both Catholic and I think this is very apparent in the book.

Speaker 1:          09:49          Something is usually said about Kafka in connection with wise blood, but I've never succeeded in making my way through the castle or the trial and I wouldn't pretend to know anything about Kafka. I think reading a little of him perhaps makes you a boulder writer and so on. If you turn over, this is another, um, this is another letter to Ben Griffith. Um, written fairly shortly after this first one. She expands a little bit on this sense of her Catholicism. This is in the middle of the page. Let me assure you that no one but a Catholic could've written wise blood even though it is a book about a kind of Protestant St, it reduces Protestantism to the twin ultimate absurdities of the church without Christ or the Holy Church of Christ without Christ, which no po Protestant, pious, pious Protestant would do. And of course, no unbeliever or agnostic could have written it because it is entirely redemption centered in thought.

Speaker 1:          10:52          Not Too many people are willing to see this and perhaps it is hard to see because Hazel motes is such an admirable nihilist. His nihilism leads him back to the fact of his redemption, however, which is what he would have liked so much to get away from. When you start describing the significance of a symbol like the tunnel which recurs in the book, you immediately begin to limit it and assemble, should go on deepening everything should have a wider significance. But I am a novelist, not a critic, and I can excuse myself from x Xsplit, Casio xsplit on to text on that ground. The real reason of course, is laziness. There's that, that, uh, characteristics self-deprecation with letters like this, which were published, uh, copiously in a, in a beautiful addition that Sarah Sally Fitzgerald edited, um, with letters like this, her frequent essays and lectures which are collected in a book called mystery and manners.

Speaker 1:          11:55          She was expounding a certain reading of her fiction even while she was still writing it. And those who were close to her have picked up that understanding of her fiction and promulgated it. And there's a huge critical industry around Flannery O'Connor. And at the core of it is a body of criticism that fines and articulate and explains the religious meanings of her texts. With that in mind, I want to point up to the two quotations that I put on the board to start us off today. Um, I like his eyes. They don't look like they see what he's looking at, but they keep on looking. This is Sabbath, Lily Hawks and then, uh, a character you haven't met yet. If you stopped at page 100 Ani j holy, I wouldn't have you believe nothing. You can't feel in your own hearts. These two quotations seem to me a kind of rubric under which we can start to think about what it means to read this novel and what it means to read it in the light of the religious context that O'connor herself, critics, marketers have built up around her work.

Speaker 1:          13:24          The first quotation from Sabbath Lilly of course, focuses on the eyes and it, it is not hard to read into haze, motes, his name, that the trope of site is going to be important haze motes. There's that famous passage in the new testament or is it, oh gosh, now I'm going to forget if it's new or Old Testament, someone will correct me. Um, uh, do not try to remove the moat from your neighbor's eye, uh, before you have removed it from your own or less. You failed to remove the moat from your own eye. So there's this sense of occluded site haze that Hayes, somehow something is wrong with haze, motes his eyes, something wrong with his site or rather there is something important about his site that we're going to have to unpack.

Speaker 1:          14:24          But what I want to take out of Sabbath, Lily's comment about Hays is this sense of what you look at. What does Hayes look at and what does he see, what do we look at when we read this novel and what do we see? Those are questions that are going to frame the two lectures that I give on this novel. The second quotation from Ani j holy raises the question of sentiment. This novel as you will soon see once you get to the parts where Ani j holy begins to preach this novel is very much a critique of sentimentality. If Richard Wright's ideal response to his fiction was that for the reader, the words would disappear and all they would be left with is their emotional response. For O'Connor, it's precisely that kind of response to any call be a textual, be it an active reading and active audition. Hearing someone preach. That kind of response is precisely not the one you are supposed to have. And so I would ask you to think about a couple of simple questions as you move through this book. And as you think about what I have to say about it, um, one of them could begin with a reflection like this. Would you ever want to sit down to dinner with any of the people in this novel?

Speaker 1:          15:59          I see people shaking their heads, they are quite unlikable and this is consistent pretty much across O'Connor's fiction, short, long, medium, whatever. Her characters are not very endearing. So you want to ask yourself why that's, so this is a conscious decision on her part and you want to think about that decision. If there's any character who seems kind of endearing, uh, at least for me it's probably Enoch. Um, and we'll talk a little bit more about him. Um, not today but in the second lecture and in section. So with these questions in mind, I want you to think about how we can see the novel and how we can think about it in the face of the interpretation that's already layered onto it. And what I want to do is now kind of just descend into the text and read with you the passage when Hays first takes the Essex out for a spin, his, his wonderful car, the Essex.

Speaker 1:          17:16          Um, so this is on page 73 is about where it begins. And I'm going to read through the next two or three pages and I'll skip around in the book as things come up that I want to show you in other parts of the book. So let's think about seeing and theology and all the issues that are already on the table for us. I'm going to begin at the bottom of 73 when the car was ready, if you have your book, go ahead and open it up. When the car was ready, the man and the boy stood by to watch him drive it off. Is it the wrong page numbers? Shoot. Oh dear. 69 okay, so it's four off.

Speaker 2:          18:04          Okay.

Speaker 1:          18:04          Thank you for telling me. You rely on publishers and then they let you tell them.

Speaker 1:          18:14          Okay. Does everyone, everyone have it? When the car was ready, the man and the boys stood by to watch him drive it off. He didn't want anybody watching him because he hadn't driven a car in four or five years. The man in the boy didn't say anything while he tried to start it. They only stood there looking in at him. I wanted this car mostly to be a house for me. He said to the man, I ain't got any place to be. You ain't took the break off yet. The man said he took the break off in the car, shot backwards because the man had left it in reverse in a second. He got it going forward and drove off. Crookedly pass the man and boys still standing there watching. He kept going forward thinking nothing and sweating. So I'm going to stop there for a minute.

Speaker 1:          19:03          Haze sees the car as a kind of home. Well, how are we meant to understand the meaning of that? It has the feeling of a rare moment of explanation from Hayes. He almost never explains himself to other people. Here he is accounting for his need for the car. Now of course, O'connor was very good at imbuing her writing with repeated symbols that grow and accrue meaning across the text. So we've already seen the trope of the house and if you look back at 24 oh now it's tried 20 see if we can find it here.

Speaker 1:          19:58          When Hays describes or we sort of know through his consciousness the story of his time in the army, this is what we learn about how he felt there. After he's wounded, he had all the time he could want to study his soul in and assure himself that it was not there. When he was thoroughly convinced, he saw that this was something he had always known. The misery he had was a longing for home. It had nothing to do with Jesus. When the army finally let him go, he was pleased to think that he was still uncorrupted. All he wanted was to get back to Rod, Tennessee, the Black Bible and his mother's glasses. We're still in the bottom of his duffle bag. He didn't read any book now, but he kept the Bible because it had come from home. He kept the glasses in case his vision should ever become dim.

Speaker 2:          21:05          Okay.

Speaker 1:          21:08          Oh, Connor has already put in place in the novel through that little passage, the sense that the longing for home and the longing for redemption or the resistance to redemption, these things are very close to one another. You can mistake here we, we find out about Hayes. You can mistake the longing for Jesus for the longing for home or vice versa. The longing for home for the long name of Jesus. The Bible that he carries around is important to him because it comes from home. I want to suggest to you that the fact that it's the religious book for him, for his culture, for his family, is not of course incidental to the fact that it's what reminds him of home. It's not just that you can mistake the longing for, for home, for the longing for Jesus. You can in some ways see religion and home as conflated, and this gets to a sort of traditional Christian notion of the believer as not being at home in the world, that the believers somehow belongs to God's kingdom and that this is either countercultural at odds with the general world in which he or she would find herself or it is totally incompatible with the world in which we live.

Speaker 2:          22:51          Okay.

Speaker 1:          22:52          The Bible is a physical manifestation of the proximity of the spiritual and the material in this world. So what makes him feel close to home in a way has to make him feel close to the religion he's trying to reject. That conflation is part of what makes it impossible for Hays to escape the question of redemption. Even if he wants to answer it in a way that's at odds with how, for example, his grandfather, the preacher would answer it. This is why he's continually mistaken for a preacher. No matter what he does. Remember he goes into the, into the prostitute's house, Mrs. Watts, and he's got a hat on and the hat just makes him look like a preacher. There's nothing he can do. He says, I'm not a preacher. And he says, that's okay if you will, if you're not a preacher.

Speaker 1:          23:46          It's just something that's in his body. It's physical. So the car, going back to the passage I was talking about before with the Essex, the car, even though religion is not mentioned directly right here, the sense of home that it embodies carries with it all that sense of unhoused newness. And because it's a moving house, it carries the sense of the wandering believer with it as well. And you get that reinforced on the very next page. If you just, um, skip over about a page from there, a black pickup truck turned off a side rose at road in front of him on the back of it, an iron bed and a chair and table were tied and on top of them a crate of Barb rock chickens. So other cars on the road look like houses, mobile houses as well. It's not just Hayes's Essex that is imagined as home. So O'Connor is giving us a version of the road and I want you to keep this in mind because of course we're going to read on the road and we're going to see a major road trip in Lolita, actually two of them. So the, the iconography of the American road is something that is going to come back to us. Well here's our first example. This is the road of the unhoused of the spiritually seeking of the wandering of the last. People wander in search of some kind of coherent meaning

Speaker 1:          25:31          what to now move down a little bit and observe how landscape is presented to us. This is after that, since he was going very fast, the highway was ragged with filling stations and trailer camps and roadhouses. After awhile there were stretches where red gullies dropped off on either side of the road and behind them there were patches of field button together with six, six, six posts. The Sky leaked all over, all of it. And then it began to leak into the car. The head of a string of pigs appeared, snowed up over the ditch and he had to screeched to a stop and watch the rear of the last pig disappears, shaking into the ditch on the other side. He started the car again and went on. He had the feeling that everything he saw was a broken off piece of some giant blank thing he had forgotten had happened to him.

Speaker 2:          26:30          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          26:31          So what do we notice about this landscape? First of all, it's very much constructed. It's buttoned together with posts as if someone had built it. And what's more, these are described as six, six, six posts. I think this is a probably a size of lumber. Um, but you can't get away from the, uh, the mythology of that number in the book of revelation. It's the number of the beast. It's the number of the devil. It's also a landscape that is full of pigs, wandering pigs. So if the people are wandering through this road, the pigs are equally wanderers, um, throughout these fields. They're unconfined they seem to cross the road at will.

Speaker 2:          27:20          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          27:21          The Sky, the world above is really bound up with the world below. There's very little separation. Even if there is a sense that the sky is impinging on the earth and not the other way around, the sky leaked over all of it. It's really in a sense, the physical images of rain. It's raining, so it's leaking all over it. But there's more than that. There's this sense of, um, the concerns of the sky. Somehow the concerns of the above, the concerns of the transcendent are seeping their way into the concerns of the material world below. And then you get that sort of lyrical moment of interpretation. He had the feeling that everything he saw was a broken off piece of some giant blank thing he had forgotten had happened to him. Now this is where the omniscient narrator comes in quite forcefully and gives us something to work on as we analyze Hayes and we think about who he is as a character and where he finds himself.

Speaker 1:          28:34          This connects I think with a whole host of other passages that have to do with nothingness. And one of them is right above on that page and I read it a little earlier thinking nothing and sweating. It's as if thinking nothing. It's not a passive activity but an active one. So that to think nothing is something you have to work at. It's something that you can be preoccupied with. And similarly, if you look back, um, at 37, this is again, uh, a description of landscape. You can see this connection between or well as somewhat of a disconnection between the above and the below. Another description of sky,

Speaker 1:          29:25          this is Hazel. I'm walking in talking to him. The black sky was underpinned with long silver streaks. This is the very beginning of chapter three for trying to find it that looked like scaffolding and depth on depth behind it were thousands stars that all seem to be moving very slowly as if they were about some vast construction work that involved the whole order of the universe and would take all time to complete. No one was paying any attention to the sky here. That omniscient narrator as when that narrator looks into Hayes's mind offers you a reading of the sky and it's separation from the minds of the characters that suggests or makes you look for kinds of structure. Here it's the construction work. She actually uses that word, but you get scaffolding. You get depth or perspective counting. Thousands of stars moving as if they were about some vast work that involve the whole order of the universe.

Speaker 1:          30:36          It volts, the very concrete materiality, the physicality of these characters in their circumstances. It vaults that discussion into a much larger metaphysical transcendent context. The whole order of the universe. It's moments like these when that omniscient narrator lives up to its name, that sense of omniscience that we might associate with God. Another example is that the very opening of the book, the train was racing through tree tops that fell away at intervals and showed the son's standing very red on the edge of the farthest woods near the plowed fields, curved and faded and a few and the few hogs nosing in the furrows looked like large spotted stones. Mrs Wally be Hitchcock who was facing moats in the section said that she thought the early evening like this was the prettiest time of day and she asked him if he didn't think so. Too pretty is not exactly the word that comes to mind, at least not to my mind when I read this.

Speaker 1:          31:40          It's more like heavy or saturated and there's again, pigs running around. Again, there's a biblical iconography behind this that uh, there are two instances that come to my mind. Um, when demons are cast out by the apostles and sent into a herd of pigs and the pigs go running off a cliff and die, that's one image. Another is the um, the admonition not to throw your pearls before swine, not to preach to those who can't hear or won't be perceptive. So these moments of landscape description offer up that consistently Christian inflected theory of the universe, that sense of transcendence as structure, as something that's moving inexorably that we'll take all time to complete. It has a, it has a teleology, so that's present in all of these moments. But equally present, I want to get back to this sense of blankness. There's a vagueness to this language that I think is quite calculated and it relates in Hayes's case to his determination to not be converted to evil but to nothing. When he's in the army, he says he decides he can get rid of Jesus by converting not evil, but to but to nothing, to believe in nothing.

Speaker 1:          33:22          So what O'Connor does is she presents a sense of the world imbued with structure and meaning, but a structure and meaning that looks essentially blank. And I think the task of the novel is to fill that structure in.

Speaker 2:          33:42          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          33:42          The last thing I want to point out in this passage from here to the end of the chapter is the way that Hayes's senses are described. We already talked a little bit about his name and the occlusion of sight. The trope of site is obviously extremely important. Here we have the blind preacher. Um, there are more things which I won't reveal. Uh, that happened at the end of the novel to do with this. If you haven't read, I won't give it away, but here there are simpler examples. When the truck pulls up in front of haze and starts moving very slowly, he's started pounding his horn and he had hit it three times before he realized it didn't make any sound. He keeps doing this. When he comes to the roadside sign, woe to the blast femur and whoremonger we'll hell swallow you up. Says the pickup truck slowed even more as if it were reading. The sign in. Hayes pounded his empty horn. He beat on it and beat on it, but it didn't make any sound.

Speaker 2:          34:53          He

Speaker 1:          34:54          doesn't at first hear the horn fail to blow.

Speaker 2:          35:01          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          35:01          And then later when a car pull, a truck pulls up behind him, he fails to hear a horn that does blow. He was looking at the sign and he didn't hear the horn. An oil truck, as long as the railroad car was behind him in a second, a red square face was at his car window. It watched the back of his neck and hat for a minute, and then a hand came in and sat on his shoulder.

Speaker 1:          35:28          The driver's expression in his hand stayed exactly the way they were, as if he didn't hear very well. These two characters are as if there is a a wall between them, a wall of foam. They can't hear each other. They're insulated from understanding what the other is preoccupied with. In Hayes's case, he does this over and over and over again, and the most pitiful example of it is on 57. Poor Ethan Hawke feel so bad for him in this. In this passage, Enoch is trying to hang out with Hayes. Um, this is on the bottom of 56 probably your 52 he's trying to get, he's just trying to get rid of Enoch. Listen, Hayes said roughly. I got business of my own. I seen all of you I want, he began walking very fast in our, kept skipping steps to keep up. I've been here two months.

Speaker 1:          36:30          He said, and I don't know, and nobody, people ain't friendly here. I got me a room and there ain't never nobody in it, but me. My Daddy said I had to come. I would never have come, but he made me, I think I seen you summers before. You ain't from Stockwell our, you know. Millsy no saw mill set. They're set up there once, you know at said look like you had kind of a familiar face. They walked on without saying anything until they got to the main street again. It was almost deserted. Goodbye Hayes said, I'm going this way to, you know, at sadness in salon voice on the left. There was a movie house with the electric bill was being changed and then I'm going to skip down. My daddy made me come. He said in a crack voice. Hayes looked at him and saw he was crying.

Speaker 1:          37:11          His face seemed and wet and purple, purple, pink color. I ain't but 18 years old. He cried and he made me calm. And I don't know nobody. Nobody here, I'll have nothing to do with nobody else name friendly. He done gone off with a woman and made me come, but she ain't gonna stay for long. Okay. And so on and so on. Poor EasyKnock. Does Hayes Care? No, not at all. He's looked straight ahead with his face set. Poor Enoch. Nothing can penetrate Hayes's imperviousness to other human beings. If Hayes is busy looking at something, what he's looking at is manifestly not the person in front of him. He can't hear major elements of the soundscape. The car horn behind the truck horn behind him. He can't hear his own horn. Whether it blows or not, he can't hear the voices of other people. What he sees is a mystery as Sabbath.

Speaker 1:          38:17          Lily says they don't his eyes, they don't look like they see what he's looking at. What is he looking at them I think were meant to understand that he is so focused on the question of redemption that he fails. See anything else. He fails to see any one else in his preoccupation with that problem. Now I want to switch gears just for the last couple of minutes and ask you what do you see? What do you see when you read this novel and I'm going to suggest to you something to think about. I see body parts. When I read this novel, I see a lot of dismembered body parts. What do I mean by that? Well, let's take a look on page 32 try 28 see if you can find it. This is Hayes coming to the house of Leroy Watts. He went up to the front porch and put his eye to a convenient crack in the shade and found himself looking directly at a large white knee.

Speaker 2:          39:40          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          39:40          and what's she doing? She's cutting her toenails. Mrs. Watts was sitting alone in a white iron bed cutting her toenails with a large pair of scissors. She was a big woman with very yellow hair and white skin that glistened with a greasy preparation she had on a pink nightgown that would have better fit, a smaller figure that large white knee. The way this narration allows us to see through Hazel's eyes begins to take the whole body apart. So what he sees is not Mrs. Watts, he sees a large white knee. We saw a version of this also in the passage I was reading just before where a hand comes in the window and rests, lands on Hayes's shoulder, a square red face, and then these things, these body parts are then referred to with the Pronoun. It, it, the hand did this or that. Um, take a look at page 18.

Speaker 2:          40:52          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          40:53          this is Mrs Hitchcock in the train is Hayes bumping into Mrs Hitchcock going around the corner. He ran into something heavy and pink. It gasped and muttered clumsy. It was Mrs Hitchcock and a pink wrapper with her hair in knots around her head. She looked at him with her eyes squinted, nearly shut the knobs, framed her face like dark toadstools. She tried to get past him and he tried to let her, but they were both moving the same way each time. Her face became purpleish except for little white marks over it that didn't heat up. It's like she's rotting. There's mushrooms growing on her figurative mushrooms growing on her head. Her face is purple except for the white marks, the white marks or little scars, acne scars. Perhaps she is a p, a sort of mass of flesh as Mrs. Watts. That Pink Rapper, these actually to pee pink wrappers too tight on their bodies, suggest the excess of their corporate reality. They're big hunks of flesh on 62

Speaker 2:          42:07          yeah,

Speaker 1:          42:07          we get Hayes's. An account of Hayes Hayes is a childhood sin. He goes into the freak show at the fair and he joins the crowd where his father also is there. We're looking down into a little into a lowered place where something white was lying, squirming a little in a box line with black cloth for a second. He thought it was a skinned animal and then he saw it was a woman

Speaker 1:          42:42          on 15 I'm going to skip back to the train. I'm just going to rack these up for you and then we'll think about them. This is Hayes waiting to be seated in the dining car of the train. He's hesitated and saw the hand jerk again, the hand of the steward. He lurched up the aisle, falling against two tables on the way and getting his hand wet in somebody's coffee. The steward placed him between uh, with three young youngish women dress like parrots. Their hands were resting on the table, read speared at the tips. He sat and looked in front of him. I'm skipping down a little bit. Glomerin intense at the neck of the woman across from him at intervals. Her hand holding the cigarette would pass the spot on her neck. It would go out of its his site and then it would pass. Again, going back down to the table, what do we make of these odd moments of description? Why all these body parts hanging around? Why this sense of disgusting excessive body matter. It's often women who appear in this guys, but it's not always women. What I want to suggest to you is that when we actually look at the sentences on the page, when we look at the words that O'Connor chose in the moments of the narration, we see something that becomes more complicated than the Flannery O'connor is a Catholic writer, haze motes. Is it Christian mongrave Louie.

Speaker 1:          44:26          That's a kind of focus. If we think about this and analogize it to how Hayes looks, it's a way of looking at our Connor's fiction that sees nothing but the theology behind it that sees nothing but the Christian iconography. And I want to ask what is it that we don't see when that's all we see. What do we miss? I've be gone to point out a few things that I think we miss the fragmentation of bodies. Why our bodies consistently fragmented, not just here. Everywhere in O'connor's fiction, people are always losing a wooden leg and you know, having bar parts of their limbs fall off. It's very hard to keep a body together in O'Connor. Hard to keep body and soul to get well. Well, I won't get into that. Um, so why is that? What kind of methodology for reading would allow us to have something to say about that.

Speaker 1:          45:29          Is it something we need to have something to say about? Is it in the same register of importance in our reading as some of these more theological structural considerations that have been offered to us in her letters and her preface and in the very overt symbology of the landscape scenes of these other scenes that I was reading to you today in that image of the unhoused believer, trying to find a home in a an alien world. So in my next lecture, what I'm going to do is pretty much contradiction. Most of what I said today, I'm going to set aside theology as the lens through which I read, and if you felt you were convinced by my reading of that iconography in these passages, then you want to think about why that's convincing. Whether you want to think about how much attention and primacy we should give to an author, statements about what her work means as readers. Maybe you want to say, you can't argue with that. We have to accept that. That's really what the writer intends to say, and that's what we should see. And that's what we should strive to understand. Well, I'm going to offer you two different ways, actually more like three different ways to look at the novel in the second lecture. So finish the novel for next Wednesday, and, um, and we will go from there.
