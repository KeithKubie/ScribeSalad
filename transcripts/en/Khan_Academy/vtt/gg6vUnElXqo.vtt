00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.750
This problem says, some people
use the letters F-O-I-L, or

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:08.480
FOIL, as a strategy for making
sure they have multiplied all

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.390
the terms. Use the FOIL approach
to multiply 3x plus

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:15.240
2, times 5x minus 7.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.010
I'm going to let you know just
from the get-go, I personally

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:21.750
don't like FOIL because it's
kind of just a mnemonic to

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.970
kind of memorize steps, and
you really don't know what

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:24.470
you're doing.

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.620
But since this problem
says use FOIL, I

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:29.810
guess we'll use FOIL.

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:31.250
So let's just use FOIL.

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.310
So FOIL stands for-- and
that's why I hate these

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:37.370
mnemonics, because as soon as
you're done with the test

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:39.110
you're going to forget this, and
when you're 30 years old

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.590
you're not going to even
remember what FOIL stands for.

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:43.710
Especially how to apply it.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:53.260
But it stands for first,
outside, inside, and last. And

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
the whole point of it is to make
sure that you multiply

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.460
every term in this first
expression with every other

00:00:58.460 --> 00:00:59.710
term in the last expression.

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:01.400
Now, the reason why you're doing
it is you're really just

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.290
doing the distributive
property twice.

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:05.570
And I'll do that later in this
video, because I really

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.250
dislike just memorizing FOIL.

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.380
But since we have it written
there, let's do it.

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.500
So first says let's multiply
the two first terms. So

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.720
first-- let me do it in
different colors-- the first

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.760
terms, two first terms
was a 3x and a 5x.

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:23.810
So you multiply the
3x times the 5x.

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.700
Then the outside says multiply
the outside numbers.

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.470
So multiply the 3x and
the negative 7.

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:31.720
So notice, we've multiplied the
3x times the 5x, and now

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.180
we're going to multiply the
3x times the negative 7.

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.450
So plus 3x times negative 7.

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.130
That's the outside.

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.370
Then it tells you to
do the inside.

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:46.570
The inside numbers are
the 2 and the 5x.

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.690
So plus 2 times 5x.

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:54.160
And then L stands for last, or
the last numbers, or 2 times

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:55.340
negative 7.

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.690
Plus 2 times negative 7.

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:00.530
Now we just have to simplify.

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:07.760
3x times 5x is 15x squared, plus
3x times negative 7 is

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.580
negative 21x.

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:15.070
2 times 5x is 10x.

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:20.010
And then you have 2 times
negative 7 is negative 14.

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.990
And now we can combine these
middle two terms right here.

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:26.010
If I have negative 21x and then
I'm adding 10x to that,

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.510
that takes me back
to negative 11x.

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.290
So this is negative 11x.

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.810
And we have the 15x
squared out front.

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:40.580
15x squared minus
11x, minus 14.

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.490
Which is the product of
these two expressions.

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:45.790
So FOIL does give you the right
answer, but it's just

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.450
not always obvious why you're
doing all of these different

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:49.890
combinations of multiplications.

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.370
But this is the right answer.

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.910
But what I want to do is take
a side here to just show you

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.760
that as long as you just knew
the distributive property, you

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:57.770
could have done this problem.

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:59.970
You did not have to know FOIL.

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.460
And this way you'll
never forget it.

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:11.200
So if I'm going to multiply 3x
plus 2, times 5x minus 7, what

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.280
you can think about is, this is
just some number here, and

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.330
if I'm multiplying times this
expression, I can just

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.050
distribute it onto
this expression.

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:20.430
If this was just a, I don't
know, if this was just a 2, we

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.220
would say, OK, this is the same
thing as 2 times 5x, plus

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:24.490
2 times negative 7.

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:26.010
That's what the distributive
property is.

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:27.730
So let's just distribute
it out.

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:28.220
Let's just distribute.

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:32.320
We have to just multiply this
whole thing times each of

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:34.920
those terms. That's just the
distributive property.

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:41.030
So you get 3x plus
2, times 5x.

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:44.120
I could write the 5x
out front here.

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.950
So that's just that
times that.

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:53.120
And then you're going to have
plus 3x plus 2, times the

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.760
second term, times negative 7.

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.760
Now, I could just put a negative
plus here and a

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:57.030
negative 7.

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.030
Or I could say it's negative
7 times 3x, plus 2.

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:04.020
So it's 5x times 3x plus 2,
minus 7 times 3x plus 2.

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:06.510
This was just the distributive
property.

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:09.910
Now, again, we can apply the
distributive property to get

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:14.000
the 5x times each of these
terms. So this is going to be

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:22.130
5x times 3x, plus 5x, times 2.

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:28.940
Just doing the distributive
property on this.

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:32.340
Now, we do it again here, so
that we have minus 7 or

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:33.590
negative 7 times 3x.

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.290
And then negative 7 times 2.

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:46.380
So minus 7 times 2.

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:47.610
And what do we get?

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:49.360
Scroll down a little bit.

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.330
I'll do these in a
neutral color.

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:55.410
We get 5x times 3x
is 15x squared.

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:58.350
5x times 2 is 10x.

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:02.620
7 times 3x is minus 21x.

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:06.000
And then negative 7 times
2 is minus 14.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.790
And just like we saw up here,
these two terms can be merged

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:14.530
into 10x minus 21x
is negative 11x.

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:18.890
So we get 15x squared
minus 11x, minus 14.

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:21.060
Could have done it just doing
the distributive property

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:23.510
twice, which you're less likely
to forget when you're

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:24.540
30 years old.

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:27.400
Or if you like, you
can memorize FOIL.
