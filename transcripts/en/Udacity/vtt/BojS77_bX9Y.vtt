00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Well, let's see. Number 3 seems pretty straightforward.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
When will we not lose any energy to friction?

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Well, if we drop something through a vacuum where there's no air,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
nothing to collide with--no energy is lost to friction.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
This very rarely happens. When is the most energy lost to friction.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Well, on a rough surface, a lot of energy gets lost to friction.

00:00:20.000 --> 99:59:59.000
That leaves a smooth surface in which--yes, some energy does get lost to heat but not all the time.
