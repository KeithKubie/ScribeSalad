00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.622
We know that f of a is what we get if we plug a in the slot of x into our

00:00:03.622 --> 00:00:09.715
function. So that means that the quantity a minus 5 times the quantity a plus 3

00:00:09.715 --> 00:00:14.150
equals 0. If we want to find out what a equals, we just need to solve for a in

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:19.910
this equation. There are two ways that this expression right here can equal 0.

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.446
If either this factor equals 0 or if this factor equals 0. And we just solve

00:00:24.446 --> 00:00:29.738
these two equations for A. As before we A equals 5 and A equals negative 3. So

00:00:29.738 --> 00:00:33.760
these are the two roots of this function. They're the two values of X that make

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.286
F of X equal 0.
