00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:07.330
 Hi in video voting problems "I'm after the mark" as I explained CGP Gray 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:11.260
 The ruling family is a problem, but this is not any ruling family, it is black 

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:13.260
 Rulers of the jungle since ancient times 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:17.320
 There are demonstrations on the absolute monarchy and the citizens of the animal kingdom 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.160
 They want to have a say in their style of government. 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.240
 Assad abandons his crown under pressure, and the king's position becomes an electoral post 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.279
 To ensure a smooth transitional period (and because she is smarter than her husband) the Lioness Queen 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:30.689
 Will retain the throne with the power to determine the rules of the election 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.099
 Her kingdom. 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.100
 And announced that every citizen gets only one vote and that the candidate obtained 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.300
 The largest number of votes wins the crown. 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.800
 This voting method claims "the first after the mark" often (and abbreviates the silly shortcut 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.920
 Or winner takes everything. 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.570
 This system is simple, fair and logical, is not it? 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:47.590
 actually no 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:49.070
 It is a very ugly idea. 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:49.440
 Why? 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.030
 To see the problems of the first after the mark we must see the events of the primary elections 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:54.579
 In the animal kingdom. 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:58.070
 It is an encouraging time in this flourishing democracy, and seven hopeful candidates are advancing 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.020
 To represent their parties, each of them performs his best efforts in election campaigns, and citizens 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.430
 To the polling stations and then count the votes and the results come as follows: 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:06.890
 The turtle gets 9% of the vote 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:08.150
 The monkey gets 18% 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:09.350
 Gorillas get 19% 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:10.430
 The owl gets 14% 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:11.430
 The cheetah gets 20% 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:12.710
 The tiger gets 15% 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:13.510
 The snake gets 6% 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:16.700
 According to the rules of the first after the mark, the leopard crowns a winner in the elections and governs 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:17.610
 For the duration of his term 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.450
 But with one look at the results and you will see the first problem with this system: 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.100
 Minority rule. The vast majority of the citizens (80%) wanted another king, however 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.750
 Al-Fahd won, in this election there were only 7 candidates, but if we assumed that there was 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.180
 Twenty, it was possible for the Cheetah to get 5% of the votes and yet be elected 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.079
 This problem of minority rule is only the beginning 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.650
 The second problem in the first after the tag is that the passage of sufficient time will cause a presence 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.360
 Inevitable and inevitable for a dual party system 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:43.850
 Why? 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.500
 To see, we will see what happens during several election cycles 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.280
 After the cheetah spends its time in office, it is time to vote again in the new democracy 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.000
 This time all the citizens of the animal kingdom remember the result of the previous time 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.579
 This information changed their behavior, especially those who voted for the tortoise and snake 

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:02.119
 They must face the fact that their candidates do not attract the citizens and the two parties and have no chance. 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:03.100
 To win. 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.450
 Turtle voters are not happy under the rule of the cheetah and then decide to support the other candidate 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.340
 The biggest chance to win is the gorilla. 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.349
 And the voters of the snake want to vote for the tiger because the candidate has the most common denominators 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:15.790
 With them, but they are afraid because the cheetah has launched a negative campaign against 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.170
 Rivals. 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.760
 Snake voters do not like the idea of ​​gorilla rule and therefore vote strategically for the leopard 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.569
 The final result is as follows: The cheetah gets 26% of the vote and the gorilla gets 28% 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:26.800
 Thereby crowning a king 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.170
 After seeing the results and after the cost of the election campaigns decides both the snake and the slide 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.040
 Withdraw from any future elections 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.489
 The system, which began with seven political parties, now has five 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:36.900
 We go directly to the next elections 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.450
 Only five candidates remain for the second time. Voters remember the events of the last elections 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.370
 In this election they vote the owl knowing that their candidate has no chance of winning. And they are 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.730
 Voters and democracies and their ideological tendencies are not very much the rest of the animal kingdom 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.860
 They do not like cheetah or gorilla 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.170
 Both the gorillas and the cheetah are aware of this and therefore they are doing a negative campaign against each other to benefit from 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:54.810
 The fears of the middlemen. 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.140
 The voices of the owl voters are divided as most of them vote against the candidate they hate 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.480
 Rather than vote for a candidate they love 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.409
 After these elections, the Gorilla gets 33% of the vote while the Cheetah gets 34% and thus wins 

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:08.890
 As the tortoise and the snake do, the owl withdraws from the next election. 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.159
 In the last elections, we will see that monkey and tiger voters are dissatisfied. They both love 

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:17.180
 The candidate they encourage, but they must give up. Monkey voters agree 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:21.239
 With gorillas in some subjects but they do not like cheetah at all. Tiger voters agree with 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:24.550
 The cheetah is in some places but they do not like gorillas at all 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:27.750
 They are strategically abandoning their preferred candidate for fear of winning the candidate they disagree with 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.400
 With the king's greatest degree 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:34.200
 The final result is the cheetah 49% and the 51% gorilla declaring either property 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.580
 The last candidates to get out of the elections are the monkey and the tiger and the animal kingdom ends 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:39.780
 Bipartisan system 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.250
 Because the owl candidates are centrist and can change their mind about future elections, the cheetah may win 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:47.019
 Then the gorilla gets it again and the cheetah wins again, but the status quo is 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:48.840
 The two parties are not changing 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.230
 The status of the citizens of the animal kingdom has ended up adhering to this system not because they are Cassali voters 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.580
 Or because this is really what they wanted, but because of the way they were prepared 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:56.700
 The mathematics of this system. 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:01.870
 It is imperative that with sufficient time, all the first systems after the mark cause a two-party system 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:05.330
 But the views of the voters have not changed since the initial elections, only 50 voters wanted 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:08.629
 One of the Gorilla and Cheetah parties as their first choice and three-fifths want 

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:10.370
 Other candidates as a first choice 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:14.269
 The majority of candidates are not interested in the electoral process because they are 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:16.840
 Because they feel that they have no way of having a meaning to express their true preference 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:21.180
 And the situation just gets worse here. If citizens are divided into electoral areas 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.340
 Before the election, they are subject to fraud in the electoral division (Gerrymandering) 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:28.570
 Cheating in the electoral division is somewhat complicated, but imagine a group of ten houses each with one vote 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:31.840
 Three voters Fahd, three Gorilla voters and four owl voters. 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:35.540
 If the voters are divided into groups before the elections, whoever determines where to draw 

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:38.440
 The lines have a big impact on who wins the elections 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.740
 For example, if three of the pharaohs are gathered together with two owls and the like 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:47.060
 With gorilla candidates you can remove the owl from the elections even though the owl candidates 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:51.460
 They have the largest minority and were supposed to win under the "first after the mark" fair 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:54.430
 If the Gorilla and Al-Fahd parties govern the period of electoral division 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:57.650
 They have a strong motivation to secure safe seats for themselves 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:59.860
 But we will go deeper into the division of electoral areas later 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:03.590
 Damn this, say, let's vote for a third party and change the regime! 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:07.340
 This introduces us to the last and the most terrible problem in the first after the sign: 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:08.650
 Impact spoiler 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:12.389
 Imagine after many years of rule of gorillas and cheetahs. 

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:16.110
 The tiger decides to return to the race. It is thought that citizens have despaired of 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:18.490
 The current situation is that he has a chance to win 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:22.650
 He prepares an electoral office and gets a sudden amount of donations from gold and goes 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:25.680
 The animal news network is going to debate with the main candidates 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:30.050
 The night of the election comes, but unfortunately, the tiger gets only 15% of the votes, mostly voters 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:33.699
 Cheetahs who are considered closer to him in the political arena. Gorillas win elections easily 

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:35.380
 And become king 

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:39.360
 The first after the mark in the worst form: the better the third party 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:43.139
 Hurts his voters by ensuring the loss of the party to which he is most consistent 

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:45.380
 And win for the party they disagree with 

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:49.910
 And do not forget, the gorilla is not an idiot, he knows how things go from where you think some came 

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:52.509
 Gold donations? 

00:05:52.509 --> 00:05:55.400
 And while this happens the Queen is not satisfied 

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:58.860
 It was watching the elections and seeing that the regime was not in the interest of its citizens 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:01.850
 And I thought, how is the election system good? 

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:06.090
 You should be able to vote for the most wanted candidate without worrying. 

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:08.259
 As more choices in candidates are better. 

00:06:08.259 --> 00:06:09.970
 The system should not be vulnerable to Gerrymandering 

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:13.380
 It must be open to new political parties 

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:16.569
 Fortunately, there are many electoral systems to choose from 

00:06:16.569 --> 00:06:20.550
 The alternative sound, but we will have to discuss in detail later 

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:27.550
 Thank you very much for watching.
