00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:04.360
Hi there my name’s John Green, this is Crash
Course World History and today we’re going

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:09.460
to talk about the Dark Ages, possibly
the most egregious Eurocentrism in all of history,

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:10.900
which is really saying something.

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:15.310
(We’re Europe! The Prime Meridian Runs Through
us; We’re in the Middle of Every Map; and

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:18.730
We Get To Be a Continent Even Though Were
Not a Continent.)

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:20.530
But let’s begin today with a pop quiz:

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:24.030
What was the best year of your life, and what
was the worst year?

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:27.920
Mr. Green, Mr. Green: Best 1994, Worst 1990.

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.590
Oh, me from the past. It gets so much better,
and also so much worse.

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:37.040
For worst year I’m gonna go with 2001; best
year 2006.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.520
Alright now it’s your turn, dear pupils: share your
best and worst years in comments during the intro.

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:50.500
[theme music]

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.480
Right, so what you will quickly find is that
your worst year was someone else’s best year.

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:55.829
So, too, with history.

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.039
The period between 600 and 1450 CE is often
called the Middle Ages in Europe because it

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:04.030
came between the Roman Empire—assuming you
forget the Byzantines—and the beginning

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:04.920
of the Modern Age.

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.750
And it’s sometimes called the Dark Ages,
because it was purportedly unenlightened.

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.490
But was the age so dark?

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:12.890
Depends on what you find depressing.

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.340
If you like cities and great poetry, then
the Dark Ages were indeed pretty dark in Europe.

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.960
But if like me your two favorite things are
Not Dying From Wars and not dying from anything else,

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.170
the Dark Ages actually weren’t that bad—

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.430
at least until the plague came in the 14th
century.

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:29.360
And meanwhile, outside of Europe,

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.939
the Dark Ages were truly an Age of Enlightenment.But
we’ll get boring Europe out of the way first.

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:35.259
Let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:40.400
Medieval Europe had less trade, fewer cities, and
less cultural output than the Original Roman Empire.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:45.119
London and Paris were fetid firetraps with
none of the planning of sewage management

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:51.000
of places 5,000 years older like Mohenjo Daro
in the Indus Valley Civilization, let alone Rome.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.640
But with fewer powerful governments,

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.509
wars were at least smaller, which is one reason
why Europeans living in Medieval Times—

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.629
Uhh THOUGHT BUBBLE I KNEW YOU WERE GOING TO
DO THAT.

00:02:00.629 --> 00:02:06.040
Anyway, people in Medieval Times lived slightly
longer — life expectancy was 30 —

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.040
than Europeans during the Roman Empire — when life expectancy was 28.

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:11.540
Instead of centralized governments,

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.900
Europe in the middle ages had feudalism, a
political system based on reciprocal relationships

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.109
between lords, who owned lots of land, and
vassals,

00:02:19.109 --> 00:02:23.669
who protected the land and got to dress up
as knights in exchange for pledging loyalty to the lords.

00:02:23.669 --> 00:02:26.180
The lords were also vassals to more important
lords,

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:28.669
with the most important of all being the king.

00:02:28.669 --> 00:02:30.239
Below the knights were peasants

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:35.769
who did the actual work on the land in exchange
for protection from bandits and other threats.

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:37.879
Feudalism was also an economic system,

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:41.969
with the peasants working the land and keeping
some of their production to feed themselves

00:02:41.969 --> 00:02:44.939
while giving the rest to the landowner whose
land they worked.

00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:48.919
The small scale, local nature of the feudal
system was perfect for a time and place where

00:02:48.919 --> 00:02:52.359
the threats to peoples’ safety were also
small scale and local.

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.579
But of course, this system reinforces the status quo –

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:59.709
there’s little freedom and absolutely no
social mobility:

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:02.010
Peasants could never work their way up to
lords,

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.519
and they almost never left their villages.

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:04.480
Thanks, Thought Bubble.

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.219
One more point that’s very interesting from
a world history perspective:

00:03:07.219 --> 00:03:12.959
this devolution from empire to localism has
happened in lots of places at lots of different times.

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.819
And in times of extreme political stress,

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:17.419
like after the fall of the Han dynasty in
China,

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:23.040
power tends to flow into the hands of local lords who
can protect the peasants better than the state can.

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.139
We hear about this a lot in Chinese history
and also in contemporary Afghanistan,

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:32.359
but instead of being called feudal lords,
these landlords are called warlords.

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:33.930
Eurocentrism striking again.

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:35.489
The other reason the Dark Ages are called
Dark

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:37.790
is because Europe was dominated by superstition

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:42.309
and by boring religious debates about like
how many angels can fit on the head of a pin.

00:03:42.309 --> 00:03:43.249
And while there’s something to that,

00:03:43.249 --> 00:03:46.180
the Middle Ages also saw theologians like
Thomas Aquinas,

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.629
who was quite an important philosopher,

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:49.749
And women like Hildegard of Bilgen,

00:03:49.749 --> 00:03:54.909
who wrote all this important liturgical music and also
basically invented the genre of the morality play.

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:59.289
All that noted, things were certainly brighter 
in the Islamic world, or Dar al Islam.

00:03:59.289 --> 00:04:00.819
So when we last left the Muslims,

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:04.969
they had expanded out of their homeland in
Arabia and conquered the rich Egyptian provinces

00:04:04.969 --> 00:04:07.799
of the Byzantines and the entire Sassanian
empire,

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:09.459
all in the space of about 100 years.

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:14.119
The Umayyad Dynasty then expanded the empire
west to Spain and moved the capital to Damascus,

00:04:14.119 --> 00:04:17.999
because it was closer to the action, empire-wise but still in Arabia.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.600
That was really important to the Umayyads

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:23.479
because they’d established this hierarchy in the
empire with Arabs like themselves at the top and in fact

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:28.129
they tried to keep Arabs from fraternizing
with non-Arab muslims throughout the Empire.

00:04:28.129 --> 00:04:30.180
This of course annoyed the non-Arab Muslims, who were like,

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:33.580
“I don’t know if you’re reading the
same Quran we are, but this one says that

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:34.830
we’re all supposed to be equal.”

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:37.370
And pretty quickly the majority of Muslims
weren’t Arabs,

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:39.939
which made it pretty easy for them to overthrow
the Umayyads,

00:04:39.939 --> 00:04:41.669
which they did in 750 CE.

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:44.669
Their replacements, the Abb(ah)sids, Abb(uh)sids? Hold On...

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.540
D’ahh, I’m right twice!

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:50.760
Right, so the Abbasids were from the Abb(ah)si or
the Abb(uh)-see family

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:55.610
which hailed from the Eastern and therefore
more Persian provinces of the Islamic Empire.

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:59.169
The Abbasids took over in 750 and no one could
fully defeat them —

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:02.760
until 1258, when they were conquered by — wait for it —

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:06.340
the Mongols.

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:08.680
The Abbasids kept the idea of a hereditary
monarchy,

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.110
but they moved the capital of the empire to
Baghdad,

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:15.150
and they were much more welcoming of other
non-Arab Muslims into positions of power.

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:16.060
And under the Abbasids,

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:20.229
the Dar al Islam took on a distinctly Persian
cast that it never really lost.

00:05:20.229 --> 00:05:22.389
The Caliph now styled himself as a king of
kings,

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:23.789
just like the Achaemenids had,

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:26.830
and pretty soon the caliph’s rule was a
lot more indirect,

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:28.409
just like the original Persians’.

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:30.229
This meant that his control was much weaker,

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:35.030
and by about 1000CE , the Islamic Caliphate
which looks so incredibly impressive on a

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:38.620
map had really descended into a series of
smaller kingdoms,

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:41.259
each paying lip-service to the caliph in Baghdad.

00:05:41.259 --> 00:05:44.759
This was partly because the Islamic Empire
relied more and more on soldiers from the

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:46.540
frontier, in this case Turks,

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:50.770
and also slaves pressed into military service,
in order to be the backbone of their army,

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:56.310
a strategy that has been tried over and over
again and has worked exactly zero times.

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:59.030
Which you should remember if you ever become
an emperor.

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:02.340
Actually our resident historian points out
that that strategy has worked--

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:05.749
if you are the Mongols.

00:06:05.749 --> 00:06:08.689
More important than the Persian-style monarchy
that the Abbasids tried to set up was their

00:06:08.689 --> 00:06:11.189
openness to foreigners and their ideas.

00:06:11.189 --> 00:06:16.620
That tolerance and curiosity ushered in a golden age
of Islamic learning centered in Baghdad. The Abbasids

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:21.000
oversaw an efflorescence of culture unlike anything
that had been seen since Hellenistic times.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.480
Arabic replaced Greek not only as the language
of commerce and religion, but also of culture.

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:28.620
Philosophy, medicine, and poetry were all
written in Arabic

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:31.240
(although Persian remained an important literary
language.)

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:36.650
And Baghdad was the world’s center of scholarship
with its House of Wisdom and immense library.

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:40.520
Muslim scholars translated the works of the
Greek Philosophers including Aristotle and Plato

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:43.389
as well as scientific works by Hippocrates,
Archimedes

00:06:43.389 --> 00:06:45.280
and especially the physician Galen.

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:49.040
And they translated and preserved Buddhist and
Hindu manuscripts that might have otherwise been lost.

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:51.460
Muslims made huge strides in medicine as well.

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:54.449
One Muslim scholar ibn Sina, wrote the Canon
of Medicine,

00:06:54.449 --> 00:06:58.560
which became the standard medical textbook
or centuries in both Europe and the Middle East.

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:01.360
And the Islamic empire adopted mathematical
concepts from India

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:04.279
such as the zero, a number so fascinating
and beautiful

00:07:04.279 --> 00:07:06.789
that we could write an entire episode about
it but instead

00:07:06.789 --> 00:07:08.939
I’m just gonna write it a little love poem:

00:07:08.939 --> 00:07:10.039
Oh, zero.

00:07:10.039 --> 00:07:11.249
Pretty little zero.

00:07:11.249 --> 00:07:15.889
They say you’re nothing but you mean everything
to mathematical history...and me.

00:07:15.889 --> 00:07:17.919
Oh it’s time for the Open Letter?

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:23.500
An Open Letter to Science and Religion:

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:26.099
But first lets see what’s in the Secret
Compartment.

00:07:26.099 --> 00:07:27.620
Oh, champagne poppers?

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:30.409
Stan, what am I supposed to do with these?

00:07:30.409 --> 00:07:31.610
Dear Science and Religion,

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:33.879
You’re supposed to be so irreconcilable
and everything,

00:07:33.879 --> 00:07:35.360
but not so much in the Abbasid Empire.

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:38.099
I mean, Muslim mathematicians expanded
math to such a degree

00:07:38.099 --> 00:07:40.469
that we now call the base ten number system

00:07:40.469 --> 00:07:43.629
and the symbols we use to denote it “Arabic
numerals.”

00:07:43.629 --> 00:07:46.590
And religion was at least part of what pushed
all that learning forward.

00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:48.449
Like the great philosopher Ibn Rushd argued
that

00:07:48.449 --> 00:07:52.379
the only path to religious enlightenment was
through Aristotelian reasoning.

00:07:52.379 --> 00:07:54.680
And Muslim mathematicians and astronomers
developed algebra

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:57.449
partly so they could simplify Islamic inheritance
law.

00:07:57.449 --> 00:07:59.400
Plus they made important strides in trigonometry

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:01.330
so that people understand where to turn

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:03.169
when trying to turn toward Mecca.

00:08:03.169 --> 00:08:05.460
You were working so well together, science
and religion,

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:10.059
but then like Al and Tipper Gore, just couldn’t
last forever.

00:08:10.059 --> 00:08:13.519
Nothing gold can stay in this world, nothing
gold can stay.

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:15.100
Best wishes,
John Green

00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:17.740
Baghdad wasn’t the only center of learning
in the Islamic world.

00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:22.040
In Spain, Islamic Cordoba became a center
for the arts, especially architecture.

00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:24.930
This is perhaps best exemplified by the Great
Mosque at Cordoba,

00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:29.590
built by the Umayyad ruler Abd al-Rahman I
In 785-786 CE.

00:08:29.590 --> 00:08:31.430
That’s right, this building,

00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:36.389
still standing today and one of the most amazing
mosques in the world, was built in a year,

00:08:36.389 --> 00:08:39.699
whereas medieval cathedrals typically took,
like, a million years to finish.

00:08:39.699 --> 00:08:42.620
The Muslims of Spain were also engineers who
rivaled the Romans.

00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:45.949
Aqueducts in Cordoba brought drinkable water
into the city,

00:08:45.949 --> 00:08:49.070
and Muslim scholars took the lead in agricultural
science,

00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:51.589
improving yields on all kinds of new crops,

00:08:51.589 --> 00:08:54.569
allowing Spanish lives to be longer and less
hungry.

00:08:54.569 --> 00:08:58.620
Everybody wanted to live in Spain, even the greatest Jewish philosopher, Maimonides,

00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:03.140
wanted to live in Spain, but sadly he was
expelled and ended up in Alexandria Egypt.

00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:07.240
There he wrote his awesomely titled defense
of rationality, A Guide for the Perplexed.

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:12.199
I’m translating the title, of course, because
the original text was written …in Arabic.

00:09:12.199 --> 00:09:14.630
Meanwhile, China was having a Golden Age of
its own:

00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:18.110
The Tang Dynasty made China’s government
more of a meritocracy,

00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:22.490
and ruled over 80 million people across four
million square miles.

00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:24.360
And they might’ve conquered all of Central
Asia

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:26.610
had it not been for the Abbasids, whom they
fought at

00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:28.470
the most important Battle You’ve Never Heard
Of,

00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:29.899
the Battle of the Talas River.

00:09:29.899 --> 00:09:32.250
This was the Ali-Frasier of the 8th century.

00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:36.839
The Abbasids won, which ended up defining
who had influence where with the --

00:09:36.839 --> 00:09:41.350
with the Abbasids dominating to the west of
the river and China dominating to the east.

00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:45.019
The Tang also produced incredible art that
was traded all throughout Asia.

00:09:45.019 --> 00:09:50.019
Many of the more famous sculptures from the Tang
Dynasty feature figures who are distinctly not-Chinese,

00:09:50.029 --> 00:09:52.519
which again demonstrates the diversity of
the empire.

00:09:52.519 --> 00:09:54.899
The Tang was also a golden age for Chinese
poetry

00:09:54.899 --> 00:09:58.279
with notables like Du Fu and Li Bo plying
their craft,

00:09:58.279 --> 00:09:59.959
encouraged by the official government.

00:09:59.959 --> 00:10:02.980
And the Song Dynasty, which lasted from 960
to 1258,

00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:05.800
kicked even more ass-it’s-not-cursing-if-you’re-talking-about-donkeys.

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:09.180
By the 11th century, Chinese metalworkers were producing as much
iron

00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:11.699
as Europe would be able to produce in the
18th century.

00:10:11.699 --> 00:10:14.060
Some of this iron was put to use in new plows,

00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:15.660
which enabled agriculture to boom,

00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:17.370
thereby supporting population growth.

00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:20.279
Porcelain was of such high quality that it
was shipped throughout the world,

00:10:20.279 --> 00:10:22.060
which is why we call it “china.”

00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:25.720
And there was so much trade going on that
the Chinese ran out of metal for coins,

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:27.840
leading to another innovation – paper money.

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:30.740
And by the 11th century, the Chinese were
writing down recipes for

00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:33.620
a mixture of saltpeter, sulfur and charcoal,

00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:34.959
that we now know as gunpowder.

00:10:34.959 --> 00:10:36.690
That becomes kind of a big deal in history,

00:10:36.690 --> 00:10:38.079
paving the way, as it does,

00:10:38.079 --> 00:10:41.810
for modern warfare and arena rock pyrotechnics,
and—

00:10:41.810 --> 00:10:44.070
ohhhh, THAT’S WHY.

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:50.279
Not so dark after all.

00:10:50.279 --> 00:10:52.999
Thanks for watching. We’ll see you next
week.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.240
