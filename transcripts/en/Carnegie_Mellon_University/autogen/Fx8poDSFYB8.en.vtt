that is an artificial intelligence the

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500
that is an artificial intelligence the
 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.129
that is an artificial intelligence the
fact that a eyes can read us and much of

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139
fact that a eyes can read us and much of
 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.290

faculty and now the rest of the world is

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119
faculty and now the rest of the world is
 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.029
faculty and now the rest of the world is
coming along and saying what can we do

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039
coming along and saying what can we do
 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:24.140
coming along and saying what can we do
with this how can we use this to

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150
with this how can we use this to
 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.330
with this how can we use this to
increase safety how can we use this in

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340
increase safety how can we use this in
 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.460
increase safety how can we use this in
health treatment how can we use this in

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470
health treatment how can we use this in
 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.040
health treatment how can we use this in
making apps more user-friendly so it's

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050
making apps more user-friendly so it's
 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.780
making apps more user-friendly so it's
very exciting to see that this research

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790
very exciting to see that this research
 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.670
very exciting to see that this research
that's been going on for five years is

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680
that's been going on for five years is
 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.250
that's been going on for five years is
really a center stage big companies have

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260
really a center stage big companies have
 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.690
really a center stage big companies have
started to release a lot of the

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700
started to release a lot of the
 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.549
started to release a lot of the
technologies which previously were only

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559
technologies which previously were only
 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.650
technologies which previously were only
hidden inside the companies so now if

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660
hidden inside the companies so now if
 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.569
hidden inside the companies so now if
you want to do big machine learning or

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579
you want to do big machine learning or
 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.150
you want to do big machine learning or
big computer vision you can just use

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160
big computer vision you can just use
 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.650
big computer vision you can just use

new application Carnegie Mellon has

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550
new application Carnegie Mellon has
 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:51.560
new application Carnegie Mellon has
actually got a position of

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570
actually got a position of
 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:52.970
actually got a position of
responsibility right now

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980
responsibility right now
 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.639

AI can be really good or it can be in
 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.979
AI can be really good or it can be in
some sense slightly frightening and I do

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989
some sense slightly frightening and I do
 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.979
some sense slightly frightening and I do
see our folks having disproportionate

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989
see our folks having disproportionate
 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.059
see our folks having disproportionate
importance in which way we actually go
