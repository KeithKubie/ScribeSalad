MODERATOR: Thanks for joining
us today to close out our Earth

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.535
Week with Matt Grocoff,
our special guest.

00:00:09.535 --> 00:00:12.290
Matt and I actually
met via a tour

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:16.480
of his home, which
is kind of weird.

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:21.210
But he has America's oldest
and Michigan's first net zero

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.510
energy home.

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:24.080
And articles about
this home have

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.300
been featured in "USA
Today" and "The Atlantic"

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.930
and numerous other publications.

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:34.420
Matt is the founding principal
of THRIVE Net Zero Energy

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.610
Consulting Collaborative
and the co-founder

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:39.720
of Mission Zero Fest.

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.710
And he is an advocate
and thought leader

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.767
on net zero energy building
and restorative design.

00:00:45.767 --> 00:00:47.400
So Matt, thanks for being here.

00:00:49.696 --> 00:00:51.904
MATT GROCOFF: This is great,
because this is actually

00:00:51.904 --> 00:00:54.010
the first talk that
I've gotten to do here.

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:55.853
Happy first day of spring.

00:00:55.853 --> 00:00:58.840
It comes a little bit
later here in Michigan.

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:03.040
But speaking of spring and
temperature and comfort

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.020
and everything else, we don't
measure our lives in stuff,

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.520
right?

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.980
We measure our lives
in love, in happiness.

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:13.980
But comfort is that
tool that we use,

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:15.900
that zone that we
want to put ourselves

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.810
into in order to provide us that
space for love and happiness

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:22.910
and joy and
friendship and family,

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:24.410
and all those other
wonderful things

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:26.040
that we do measure our lives in.

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.013
But about 10,000 years
ago was the first time

00:01:28.013 --> 00:01:30.900
it became off of the
savanna, out from, literally

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.589
from the treetops,
out of caves, places

00:01:32.589 --> 00:01:34.130
where we were trying
to find shelter,

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.730
and started building our own
shelter from other things.

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:38.937
Only for about 10,000 years.

00:01:38.937 --> 00:01:40.770
So originally, we went
around the camp fires

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.376
and we stayed warm.

00:01:42.376 --> 00:01:44.500
They wouldn't even sleep
8 hours through the night.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.666
They would wake up in the
middle of the night, dance

00:01:46.666 --> 00:01:48.390
around the fire to
entertain themselves.

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.590
Now we've really tried
to capitalize ourselves

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.799
with comfort as much
as we possibly can.

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.090
So we've got ourselves now
we're entertaining ourselves

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.105
with the Harlem shake,
with Gangnam style.

00:01:58.105 --> 00:02:01.435
We have-- originally, we're
pooping out by the tree and now

00:02:01.435 --> 00:02:02.720
in the outhouse.

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.560
Then we brought in
the chamber pot.

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.713
But that obviously
wasn't the real way

00:02:07.713 --> 00:02:09.563
to go, so we started
using indoor toilets,

00:02:09.563 --> 00:02:10.229
indoor plumbing.

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.070
So we have these things
that are flushing

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:14.230
15 gallons of fresh
water down the drain.

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.070
But that's still
not enough comfort.

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.510
Because if you're the
toilet trained cat owner,

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.030
you've got to have one
for your cat, as well.

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.023
Now for you
[INAUDIBLE] out there,

00:02:23.023 --> 00:02:25.388
this is the ultimate convenience
for the toilet trained

00:02:25.388 --> 00:02:26.674
cat owner.

00:02:26.674 --> 00:02:29.090
I'm assuming they're talking
about the cat, not the owner.

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:30.870
But here, if you've
got your own elephant,

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.670
you gotta have a
toilet for that, too.

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.130
It's not enough just
for the indoor animals.

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:35.780
We can't serve our
own coffee anymore

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.350
or cut our own hot dogs.

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:38.880
This one here is
my own favorite.

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.240
This is really the symbol
of the end of time,

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:43.520
as far as I'm concerned.

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.465
This is the proof of the over
capitalization of comfort.

00:02:47.465 --> 00:02:48.590
I can't make this stuff up.

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:49.240
It's real.

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:50.960
You can look this up on Amazon.

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:58.640
There's over 2,000 reviews of
this product, the Hutzler 571B.

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.420
I think B is for banana,
but I'm not sure.

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:02.920
$2.48 on Amazon.

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:03.740
And these are real.

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:04.490
These are reviews.

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:06.090
Here's one from Miss Toledo.

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.890
She raves, "this
saved my marriage.

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:12.530
What can I say about the
571B that hasn't already

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:17.920
been said about the wheel,
penicillin or the iPhone?"

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.800
And now we're starting see
the consequences of some

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.702
of this, what I call the over
capitalization of comfort.

00:03:23.702 --> 00:03:25.430
This is the number 350.

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.270
This is parts per
million of carbon dioxide

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:30.158
in our atmosphere.

00:03:30.158 --> 00:03:33.620
This is what Bill McKibben
calls the most important number

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:35.986
in the world that
everybody should know.

00:03:35.986 --> 00:03:38.940
And the reason he says that is
because James Hansen determined

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.200
that above this number, parts
per million in the atmosphere,

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.620
if we keep it above this
level for a significant period

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:52.230
of time, we can't sustain
the biosphere to which humans

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.590
have adapted over
these 10,000 years.

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:59.740
We can't sustain wildlife or
any of the living things that

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:02.052
adapted to this kind of climate.

00:04:02.052 --> 00:04:03.510
But this is the
number that I think

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.692
is the most important
number, zero.

00:04:06.692 --> 00:04:09.394
That's zero carbon pollution
going up into the atmosphere.

00:04:09.394 --> 00:04:11.810
Because this is the number
that we can impact in our daily

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:12.590
lives every day.

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:14.675
This is the number we
can impact at home.

00:04:14.675 --> 00:04:16.430
350 is for the scientists.

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:19.459
Zero carbon emissions
out of your office place,

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:22.650
from your automobiles,
from your homes,

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:25.130
completely decarbonizing
our economy down

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:28.336
to zero carbon going up
into the atmosphere, that's

00:04:28.336 --> 00:04:29.961
our ultimate goal,
and that's something

00:04:29.961 --> 00:04:32.500
that we can impact
every single day.

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.710
James Hansen gave
us that number, 350.

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:38.400
He says that stabilizing
atmospheric CO2 and climate

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:42.180
requires that CO2
emissions approach zero.

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:45.950
Now this is from a
scientific paper.

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:48.620
They didn't say
it's a suggestion,

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:51.110
they said it's a requirement.

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:55.420
It's a whole lot easier to
change the way we use energy

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:57.600
than it is to change
the laws of physics.

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.970
It is a physical
law, a requirement

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:03.870
that we have to get to
zero carbon emissions.

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:05.350
So this is our house.

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:08.493
Over here on the old
West Side in Ann Arbor.

00:05:08.493 --> 00:05:12.922
This picture was taken
probably in about 1912.

00:05:12.922 --> 00:05:15.986
Our house was built in 1901.

00:05:15.986 --> 00:05:18.110
Since we've done a little
bit of work to the house,

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:19.050
it's gotten a lot of attention.

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:20.170
We were in USA Today.

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:23.650
It was called one of the
top greenhouses of 2010.

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:26.160
The Atlantic called it
sustainable perfection.

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.400
I'm getting calls from
around the country for people

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:30.252
to-- they call me the
zero energy master.

00:05:30.252 --> 00:05:31.335
It sounds very dominating.

00:05:31.335 --> 00:05:33.790
I kind of like the term.

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:35.969
And so I spoke at the World
Renewable Energy Forum

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:38.260
at Greenbuild and Living
Futures Conference next month,

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:39.950
and at Google.

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:43.430
And people are saying, what
did you do to this house?

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:45.680
How could you get this
112-year-old house

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:47.810
to net zero energy?

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:50.285
And it's a really simple story
that goes back to 2006, when

00:05:50.285 --> 00:05:52.701
my wife and I were thinking
it might be a really good time

00:05:52.701 --> 00:05:53.326
to buy a house.

00:05:53.326 --> 00:05:54.670
And the market is going crazy.

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:56.545
If we buy a house
now, imagine what

00:05:56.545 --> 00:05:58.662
it's going to be like in 2008.

00:05:58.662 --> 00:05:59.902
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:59.902 --> 00:06:02.360
And then we heard on the radio--
and this was a true story.

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:03.276
This was the catalyst.

00:06:03.276 --> 00:06:06.000
We heard that Google was
bringing 1,000 new employees

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.060
to town.

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:08.060
And my wife called me.

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:09.075
She said, did you
just hear on NPR?

00:06:09.075 --> 00:06:10.390
Google is coming to town.

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:10.900
They're bringing
1,000 employees.

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:12.005
We've got to buy a house now.

00:06:12.005 --> 00:06:14.005
There's all these people
coming from California.

00:06:14.005 --> 00:06:16.370
They don't know what
houses are worth!

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:19.116
So this is the house we bought.

00:06:19.116 --> 00:06:22.245
And I'm pointing at the
computer, not at the screen.

00:06:22.245 --> 00:06:23.100
This was the house.

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:24.721
This was our dream house.

00:06:24.721 --> 00:06:27.299
We went in and buy this thing
on a July afternoon and said,

00:06:27.299 --> 00:06:28.840
that is the house
we want to live in.

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:30.470
It's got everything
we could ever want.

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:33.340
It's got plywood front
porch, asbestos siding,

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:35.700
zero insulation in
the entire house,

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:39.740
except for a layer of
newspaper dated 1902.

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:42.460
We had lead paint,
which everybody wants.

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:46.890
We had no operable windows,
which was really fun.

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:48.340
Even though they
weren't operable,

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:50.010
and you can see some
of the little sash

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:51.722
locks here are missing,
you could still

00:06:51.722 --> 00:06:54.330
stick a spatula or a screwdriver
right through that hole.

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:56.204
And there was plenty of
air going through it,

00:06:56.204 --> 00:06:58.990
so we weren't worried about
suffocating in the house.

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:01.750
We had carpet covering
hard pine floors that

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:04.900
were from trees that were
harvested 112 years ago

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:06.560
and were probably
growing at the time

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:10.490
Christopher Columbus
sailed for the Americas.

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:13.150
Certainly worth
putting carpet over.

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:16.180
This was a refrigerator from
1989 inside the kitchen,

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:18.710
with the linoleum floors.

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:20.710
This was the bathroom,
with the toilet

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:22.900
that flushed 5
gallons every time.

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:26.340
So we took this much waste and
turned it into this much wast.

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:28.520
And my favorite part
of that bathroom,

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:32.917
though, is the pink towel
curtains sewed together.

00:07:32.917 --> 00:07:34.750
This house didn't have
a shower at the time.

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:36.195
This was the only bath.

00:07:36.195 --> 00:07:38.355
This was one of only two
rooms in the house that

00:07:38.355 --> 00:07:41.080
had running water in it
when we brought in 2006.

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:43.492
It did have genuine
Formica tile.

00:07:43.492 --> 00:07:45.700
A few times I made the
mistake of saying it was fake.

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:48.490
But no, it's real Formica.

00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:51.776
The sink was flowing at two
or three gallons a minute,

00:07:51.776 --> 00:07:53.400
two-and-a-half, three
gallons a minute.

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:55.843
This is the Mueller
Climatrol furnace from 1957.

00:07:55.843 --> 00:07:59.475
A little white tag on there
shows the date of installation

00:07:59.475 --> 00:08:03.170
and some inspections that
were done over the years.

00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:06.200
This thing operated, it
was about 40% efficiency.

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:10.102
60% of it was just donations
to the utility company.

00:08:10.102 --> 00:08:13.572
And for the privilege of
paying that $350 a month

00:08:13.572 --> 00:08:15.280
to the utility company
to run this thing,

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:18.710
we got to sleep with two down
comforters, fully clothed

00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:21.359
in sweat pants,
sweatshirts, socks

00:08:21.359 --> 00:08:23.400
and a buckwheat pillow
heated up in the microwave

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:25.340
and shoved down at
the bottom of the bed.

00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:27.880
Barely, barely
comfortable, at that.

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:33.559
So we wanted to create
a vision for what

00:08:33.559 --> 00:08:34.909
we wanted this house to be.

00:08:34.909 --> 00:08:36.284
Because I was a
little upset when

00:08:36.284 --> 00:08:37.809
my mom came into
the house and she

00:08:37.809 --> 00:08:40.471
didn't just get blown away right
away when she saw the asbestos

00:08:40.471 --> 00:08:41.929
siding and the
carbon on the floor.

00:08:41.929 --> 00:08:43.600
I was like, so,
what do you think?

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:44.965
Check out our new house.

00:08:44.965 --> 00:08:46.620
Really upset with
my Jewish mother

00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:48.230
and she's like-- what, nothing?

00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:50.188
You're not going to say
a word about the house?

00:08:50.188 --> 00:08:51.586
It'll look nice when it's done.

00:08:51.586 --> 00:08:52.020
What do you mean?

00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:52.645
It's beautiful.

00:08:52.645 --> 00:08:53.543
Look at--

00:08:53.543 --> 00:08:56.024
So we did have a vision.

00:08:56.024 --> 00:08:58.440
Yogi Berra said that if you
don't know where you're going,

00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:00.517
you might not get there.

00:09:00.517 --> 00:09:02.850
And there's a gentleman in
town you might have heard of,

00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:06.914
Ari Weinzweig, who owns
Zimmerman's Deli, a little $45

00:09:06.914 --> 00:09:07.580
million company.

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:11.580
They talk a lot about vision.

00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:13.520
And he says, vision
is not the how.

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:16.300
Vision is the what.

00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:19.840
And as Sir Mix-a-Lot once said,
I like big whats and I cannot

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:20.563
lie.

00:09:20.563 --> 00:09:22.930
You want the biggest what
you can possibly find.

00:09:22.930 --> 00:09:24.737
Then we figure out how to do it.

00:09:24.737 --> 00:09:27.112
And it was one of the Googlers,
either Larry Page or some

00:09:27.112 --> 00:09:29.030
of the other guys who
talks about 10 times

00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:31.425
versus the 10 percent gain.

00:09:31.425 --> 00:09:32.880
So we wanted to go big.

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:34.880
We wanted to go to
this number here.

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:39.340
We wanted zero carbon emissions
out of a century old house.

00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:42.550
And having no idea
that it was impossible.

00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:45.160
But that's why we
knew it was possible.

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:47.930
This guy over here, from
another computer company,

00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:51.785
he was asked, if he had
one wish, what would it be?

00:09:51.785 --> 00:09:53.910
And he didn't say, hey,
I'd pick the next President

00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:56.195
of the United States, or
I'd bring world peace,

00:09:56.195 --> 00:10:00.705
or I would come up with
a vaccine for malaria.

00:10:00.705 --> 00:10:02.680
That's what the Gates
Foundation does.

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:04.035
He didn't say that.

00:10:04.035 --> 00:10:08.840
He said, instead, that he
would reduce global emissions

00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:11.290
to zero.

00:10:11.290 --> 00:10:13.100
Because we recognized
that if we don't

00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:18.370
get to that goal of
zero carbon emissions,

00:10:18.370 --> 00:10:21.052
there's no use in trying
to cure diseases or elect

00:10:21.052 --> 00:10:23.060
the Presidents.

00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:25.630
And there's a whole bunch
of folks jumping on board.

00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:29.316
This small company out
of Arkansas, [INAUDIBLE]

00:10:29.316 --> 00:10:31.780
out in California,
and the US Army, all

00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:34.420
have these mission
zero goals of getting

00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:37.675
to zero carbon emissions from
their company, and then some.

00:10:37.675 --> 00:10:40.940
Ultimately, they can be
restorative companies.

00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:43.534
So we figured if Walmart could
do it, then we could, too.

00:10:43.534 --> 00:10:45.450
So we hired as cheap as
laborer as we possibly

00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:47.420
could, ourselves.

00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:51.120
And we targeted our
own mission zero,

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:55.470
making the house 100%
harvesting our own energy,

00:10:55.470 --> 00:10:59.650
harvesting all of our own
water, creating zero waste.

00:10:59.650 --> 00:11:01.465
And then not only
eliminating the harm

00:11:01.465 --> 00:11:05.120
we're causing to the community
and to the environment

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:08.290
around the home, but actually
restoring the environment

00:11:08.290 --> 00:11:09.790
around the home,
and actually seeing

00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:11.748
what we can do to make
this a restorative home.

00:11:11.748 --> 00:11:13.940
And we're on that
path towards it now.

00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:16.630
Because we have the ideal
as the indicator of success.

00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:18.950
And this the ideal.

00:11:18.950 --> 00:11:21.560
That's my daughter, Jane.

00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:23.930
She's four years old now.

00:11:23.930 --> 00:11:26.540
She's the first
generation that will never

00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:29.650
know what it's like to grow
up in a carbon polluting home.

00:11:29.650 --> 00:11:32.310
She has no idea.

00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:37.550
Because this is the home that
she's getting to grow up in.

00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:41.020
This is the house in 1913.

00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:43.860
This is Philip and
Elizabeth Gouse.

00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:48.760
We bought the house
from Gert in 2006.

00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:51.845
So we're really the second
family to own this house.

00:11:51.845 --> 00:11:52.720
This is the backyard.

00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:54.929
You can see the coal
underneath covered with soot,

00:11:54.929 --> 00:11:57.815
and some of the grape vines they
used later during Prohibition.

00:11:57.815 --> 00:11:59.055
And this is 7th Street.

00:11:59.055 --> 00:12:00.680
These are the hydrangeas
that are still

00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:02.650
on the side of our house.

00:12:02.650 --> 00:12:04.800
This is Grizzly Peak
Brewing Company,

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:07.550
over at the corner of Washington
and [INAUDIBLE] Street.

00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:10.720
It was just shortly after
this photograph was taken,

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:12.930
it became the
Philip Gouse Saloon.

00:12:12.930 --> 00:12:14.840
So he would walk
out the front door

00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:18.610
to serve beer to customers
over 100 years ago,

00:12:18.610 --> 00:12:21.880
to the same place that we now
go to get beer and French fries.

00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:24.723
But what makes this photograph
unique, and the reason

00:12:24.723 --> 00:12:29.110
it was taken, was this was
the day where the Gouse

00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:32.227
family didn't have
to burn things

00:12:32.227 --> 00:12:33.560
themselves for their own energy.

00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:35.100
They could flip a
light switch, and they

00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:37.060
would get electricity
delivered to their house,

00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:39.476
with carbon burning somewhere
else that they no longer had

00:12:39.476 --> 00:12:40.127
to see.

00:12:40.127 --> 00:12:42.460
First time in human history
that this had ever happened,

00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:47.930
as soon as we started remotely
supplying electricity to homes.

00:12:47.930 --> 00:12:50.420
So Wendell Berry says,
when going back make sense,

00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:51.244
we move forward.

00:12:51.244 --> 00:12:52.785
So we really want
to take a look back

00:12:52.785 --> 00:12:55.900
at what was done
right back in the day.

00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:57.425
Now historic
preservationists love

00:12:57.425 --> 00:13:00.530
to say that old buildings are
the greenest buildings around.

00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:01.850
And there's some truth to that.

00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:04.340
They certainly did recognize
the patterns of nature.

00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:06.210
You could look at our backyard.

00:13:06.210 --> 00:13:07.955
Again, this is 1915.

00:13:07.955 --> 00:13:10.530
That's Robert again
in our backyard.

00:13:10.530 --> 00:13:13.080
And you can see
some of the things

00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:16.270
where this house was
net zero water when

00:13:16.270 --> 00:13:18.180
the Gouses' lived in it.

00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:20.920
This is the cistern
cap over here.

00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:23.600
Over to the far right, you
could see the well water,

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:25.350
where they'd bring in
a little fresh water

00:13:25.350 --> 00:13:27.641
that they needed for the
house, to fill up the bath tub

00:13:27.641 --> 00:13:28.890
or to cook with.

00:13:28.890 --> 00:13:30.530
All the rain water
fell off of the roof

00:13:30.530 --> 00:13:33.426
into the cistern that was used
for the gardens, the vegetable

00:13:33.426 --> 00:13:34.425
gardens in the backyard.

00:13:34.425 --> 00:13:36.140
So a good percentage
of their food,

00:13:36.140 --> 00:13:39.745
up until the 1940's, about
40% of produce in America

00:13:39.745 --> 00:13:42.760
was grown in people's yards.

00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:44.640
Back there, there
were chicken coops.

00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:48.360
In the 1950's, they started
making chickens illegal.

00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:49.446
They're legal again now.

00:13:49.446 --> 00:13:51.355
We have a few in our backyard.

00:13:51.355 --> 00:13:53.500
Then there was a dog
house back there for Fido.

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:55.864
Now Fido's job was
to guard the chickens

00:13:55.864 --> 00:13:57.280
from the foxes and
things that ran

00:13:57.280 --> 00:13:58.980
around the Old West
Side of Ann Arbor.

00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:00.513
The foxes are long gone.

00:14:00.513 --> 00:14:04.550
But they did have the
composting toilet, also known

00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:05.960
as the outhouse.

00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:08.370
So a couple of these things
are wonderful to go back to.

00:14:08.370 --> 00:14:12.287
Natural ventilation, harvesting
food from our own property,

00:14:12.287 --> 00:14:13.870
capturing our water,
things like that.

00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:15.740
And certainly,
composting toilets.

00:14:15.740 --> 00:14:18.070
But that's probably
not the best design.

00:14:18.070 --> 00:14:21.077
I think we could probably
do better than that.

00:14:21.077 --> 00:14:22.660
But that these
households were perfect

00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:25.370
is really the myth
of the noble house.

00:14:25.370 --> 00:14:30.080
Because the Gouses' were burning
about 1,200 pounds of coal

00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:33.280
to cook and heat with
every single month.

00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:36.190
That's about 100
pounds of ash alone.

00:14:36.190 --> 00:14:40.263
That's not a way we're going to
go back to heating or cooking.

00:14:43.910 --> 00:14:47.715
Our streams and our rivers
were turned into sewers.

00:14:47.715 --> 00:14:50.090
There were so polluted with
chemicals and everything else

00:14:50.090 --> 00:14:51.673
from all the industrial
processes that

00:14:51.673 --> 00:14:53.835
were going in in Ann
Arbor, heavy metal, sewage,

00:14:53.835 --> 00:14:56.355
you name it, was going
straight into the creeks,

00:14:56.355 --> 00:14:58.560
that in the 1930's
we decided, hey

00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:00.950
we have the engineering
capability of just turning

00:15:00.950 --> 00:15:03.930
these natural services
into actual sewers.

00:15:03.930 --> 00:15:06.085
And now they're buried
in a concrete pipe.

00:15:06.085 --> 00:15:08.910
And throughout Ann Arbor, just
about every one of us every day

00:15:08.910 --> 00:15:10.962
walks across one
of these creeks,

00:15:10.962 --> 00:15:12.795
without ever knowing
that it's ever existed.

00:15:12.795 --> 00:15:15.280
One of them runs right
next door to our house.

00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:18.570
This is the Allen Creek, as
it goes underneath Washington

00:15:18.570 --> 00:15:21.930
Street, right by the YMCA.

00:15:21.930 --> 00:15:25.350
It's buried under a pipe.

00:15:25.350 --> 00:15:29.230
Before the Gouses' in the
1700's, early 1800 's,

00:15:29.230 --> 00:15:34.510
the primary fuel for cooking
and heating was wood.

00:15:34.510 --> 00:15:36.607
Now humans are the
only species on earth

00:15:36.607 --> 00:15:38.690
that have ever burned
anything for our own comfort

00:15:38.690 --> 00:15:41.170
and survival.

00:15:41.170 --> 00:15:43.150
So wood was plentiful.

00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:46.720
In 1799, they
wrote that Michigan

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:50.660
had inexhaustible hard pine
forests, inexhaustible.

00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:52.706
No way you could
possibly use it all.

00:15:52.706 --> 00:15:55.830
The canopy of the trees
was so thick and dense,

00:15:55.830 --> 00:15:58.180
they said a squirrel could
hop across the canopy

00:15:58.180 --> 00:16:01.485
from the Upper Peninsula of
Michigan all the way down

00:16:01.485 --> 00:16:03.895
to Northern Florida without
ever touching the ground.

00:16:03.895 --> 00:16:06.394
That's how thick the forests
of the East Coast of the United

00:16:06.394 --> 00:16:07.618
States were.

00:16:07.618 --> 00:16:14.270
But by 1890, this is
about how much wood

00:16:14.270 --> 00:16:18.340
each house was burning at the
time, 15 to 20 cord of wood.

00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:22.112
So to give you an idea, that's
4 feet wide, 16 feet high,

00:16:22.112 --> 00:16:24.320
up to the top of these
ceilings, and the entire width

00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:28.190
of this hall here.

00:16:28.190 --> 00:16:29.920
Every single home
was burning that,

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:31.880
just to cook and heat with.

00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:36.960
So by 1890, this was
Hermanville, Michigan.

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:40.430
We had exhausted 95% of
all of the forest cover

00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:43.575
in the state of Michigan
in less than 100 years.

00:16:46.044 --> 00:16:47.835
That was before the
population of the world

00:16:47.835 --> 00:16:49.590
had hit 1 billion people.

00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:55.790
So we can't go back to--
I was in a farmer's market

00:16:55.790 --> 00:16:57.470
and somebody was selling kale.

00:16:57.470 --> 00:16:59.675
And this guy with dreadlocks
said to me, hey, well,

00:16:59.675 --> 00:17:01.150
we can just go back
to living in yurts.

00:17:01.150 --> 00:17:02.691
And I'm like, well,
how are you going

00:17:02.691 --> 00:17:05.750
to heat 130 million
yurts in the US?

00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:08.319
That's not really a
sustainable solution either.

00:17:08.319 --> 00:17:10.260
We can do better than that.

00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:11.010
Lighting.

00:17:11.010 --> 00:17:14.310
Every neighborhood,
every city had a place

00:17:14.310 --> 00:17:19.329
where you could in and buy any
kind of liquid that burned,

00:17:19.329 --> 00:17:19.829
really.

00:17:19.829 --> 00:17:23.874
You had lard oil, camphor,
kerosene, whale oil.

00:17:23.874 --> 00:17:27.939
If it was liquid and it
burned, they sold it.

00:17:27.939 --> 00:17:31.530
And this is how
we lit our homes.

00:17:31.530 --> 00:17:34.055
And I think it's
coming up pretty soon,

00:17:34.055 --> 00:17:36.160
they call it Earth Hour.

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:37.980
Earth Hour is where
around the globe,

00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:39.510
we want to bring awareness
to the amount of electricity

00:17:39.510 --> 00:17:40.010
we use.

00:17:40.010 --> 00:17:42.218
And so they have everyone
just turn off their lights.

00:17:42.218 --> 00:17:44.460
They turn off the lights
that illuminate the Eiffel

00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:49.720
Tower, the Empire State
Building in New York.

00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:52.080
And everyone gets together
and has these really intimate

00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:52.580
meals.

00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:55.990
We all light
candles to put focus

00:17:55.990 --> 00:17:58.900
on the attention of how
much energy we're using.

00:17:58.900 --> 00:18:01.430
So some enterprising
young graduate student

00:18:01.430 --> 00:18:05.325
decided, well, how much CO2
comes out of a paraffin candle?

00:18:05.325 --> 00:18:09.570
Can we go back away from the
light bulb to the paraffin

00:18:09.570 --> 00:18:11.600
candle to light
our way at night ?

00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:14.310
And he figured out that
the paraffin candle

00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:17.390
uses 10 times the amount of CO2
of an incandescent light bulb

00:18:17.390 --> 00:18:19.280
per lumen.

00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:22.230
So we're not going
back to that, either.

00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:25.070
And this is what
our electric lights

00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:29.019
look like at night from space.

00:18:29.019 --> 00:18:31.310
Somebody said once, it looks
like the planet's on fire.

00:18:31.310 --> 00:18:32.540
And in a way, it is.

00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:35.081
Because we're actually digging
up these 100 millions of years

00:18:35.081 --> 00:18:40.500
of stored solar energy and
burning them for electricity,

00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:43.150
and setting all the particulate
matter and all that carbon

00:18:43.150 --> 00:18:45.358
that was stored in the ground
up into the atmosphere.

00:18:45.358 --> 00:18:47.340
And that number rises
every single day.

00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:48.340
So here's the challenge.

00:18:48.340 --> 00:18:53.450
We've got 130 million existing
homes in America already here.

00:18:53.450 --> 00:18:57.030
So California has said, look,
if we're going to do this,

00:18:57.030 --> 00:19:01.040
then all new homes from now on,
starting about the 2020 Energy

00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:03.550
Code, they have to
be net zero energy.

00:19:03.550 --> 00:19:05.334
And that's incredibly ambitious.

00:19:05.334 --> 00:19:06.125
And it's necessary.

00:19:06.125 --> 00:19:09.490
And it's a wonderful
thing they're doing.

00:19:09.490 --> 00:19:11.320
But if you really
think about it,

00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:14.630
if all new homes and all new
buildings are net zero energy.

00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:17.996
They don't emit a single
bit of carbon pollution

00:19:17.996 --> 00:19:20.770
for their entire life,
starting this afternoon,

00:19:20.770 --> 00:19:23.300
everything new, zero emissions.

00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:28.652
How much does that lower
our current carbon output?

00:19:28.652 --> 00:19:31.070
And the answer is zero.

00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:38.950
We have to do something with
the existing building stock.

00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:41.070
So is that really possible?

00:19:41.070 --> 00:19:45.164
Well, Amory Lovins says if it
exists, it must be possible.

00:19:45.164 --> 00:19:46.455
So let me show you what exists.

00:19:49.470 --> 00:19:51.100
These are the numbers
from our house.

00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:52.730
The slide's a
little bit outdated.

00:19:52.730 --> 00:19:56.700
This is from October,
2011 through 2012.

00:19:56.700 --> 00:20:00.240
So this a year's worth of
energy data for our house.

00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:02.980
On the roof of our house,
we produce 95 kilowatt hours

00:20:02.980 --> 00:20:04.610
of solar.

00:20:04.610 --> 00:20:08.750
We used about 7,500 kilowatts,
and we put 2,000 kilowatts back

00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:12.266
onto the grid, that
we weren't even using.

00:20:12.266 --> 00:20:13.682
This is what a
typical energy bill

00:20:13.682 --> 00:20:17.982
looks like in our house, minus
the $8 a month, give or take.

00:20:17.982 --> 00:20:19.232
Sometimes it's more than that.

00:20:19.232 --> 00:20:21.570
Sometimes it's in the 100's,
sometimes a little bit less

00:20:21.570 --> 00:20:22.070
than that.

00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:25.390
So we did some math, and we
figured that over 30 years,

00:20:25.390 --> 00:20:27.980
the life of our mortgage--
people go into the house,

00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:30.230
they know exactly how much
taxes they're going to pay,

00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:32.310
they know how much the
mortgage is going to be.

00:20:32.310 --> 00:20:33.400
And I'll even give
you a chart when

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:35.525
you get your loan, what
are you going to spend over

00:20:35.525 --> 00:20:37.100
30 years with all
of that interest.

00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:39.016
But nobody says, what
am I going to spend over

00:20:39.016 --> 00:20:42.370
30 years to run this house?

00:20:42.370 --> 00:20:46.835
And this is the number that we
came up with, $283,000 of shift

00:20:46.835 --> 00:20:49.940
in energy costs for
us over 30 years.

00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:53.010
Now in fairness, that's
at 7% energy inflation.

00:20:53.010 --> 00:20:56.101
And the coal industry say, well,
it's only going to be 4.3%.

00:20:56.101 --> 00:20:57.600
So if we split the
difference, we're

00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:01.800
still talking about $234,000
energy swing for us.

00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:07.200
So net zero energy has gotten
the financial thumbs up.

00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:08.745
But the coal industry is right.

00:21:08.745 --> 00:21:11.960
And they'll say, well, look,
that's not fair to say 7%,

00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:15.000
because we have no idea
what the price of energy

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:16.910
is going to be
like in the future.

00:21:16.910 --> 00:21:20.370
And that's exactly the point.

00:21:20.370 --> 00:21:25.080
There's no commodity trader
on the planet, not the best

00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:28.620
ones out there, that will
know that in 20 minutes

00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:32.600
at the close of the
Commodity Exchange today,

00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:36.975
how much the raw cost of coal
or petroleum or natural gas

00:21:36.975 --> 00:21:37.600
is going to be.

00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:40.540
They don't know it today,
tomorrow, five days from now.

00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:41.682
No idea.

00:21:41.682 --> 00:21:43.870
They might get an
approximation, but they'll never

00:21:43.870 --> 00:21:45.387
get the number right.

00:21:45.387 --> 00:21:47.220
But any 5-year-old can
tell you exactly what

00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:49.950
the raw cost of solar
energy or wind energy

00:21:49.950 --> 00:21:53.436
is going to be 10,000
years from now.

00:21:53.436 --> 00:21:55.060
The only difference
in cost is the cost

00:21:55.060 --> 00:21:57.390
of building the power plant.

00:21:57.390 --> 00:21:59.462
So here's how you do it.

00:21:59.462 --> 00:22:00.670
It's a pretty simple formula.

00:22:00.670 --> 00:22:02.211
You lose less, you
use less, and then

00:22:02.211 --> 00:22:03.920
you produce all the
energy that you need.

00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:06.377
And what you do is you really
try to optimize your comfort.

00:22:06.377 --> 00:22:08.690
Because when we first moved
in, and people started

00:22:08.690 --> 00:22:11.960
writing about our house
and the work we were doing,

00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:13.800
everyone immediately
assumed, clearly,

00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:16.090
they're hippies bathing
in their pasta water.

00:22:16.090 --> 00:22:18.658
This is-- [LAUGHTER]

00:22:18.658 --> 00:22:21.937
But as it turns out, we invite
over 1,000 people a year

00:22:21.937 --> 00:22:23.020
to come through our house.

00:22:23.020 --> 00:22:24.580
And we show them, we have
all the same appliances

00:22:24.580 --> 00:22:25.820
that everybody else has.

00:22:28.670 --> 00:22:30.520
The difference is
that they're always

00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:33.290
the most efficient appliances,
and we control them.

00:22:33.290 --> 00:22:35.880
So right now, our
home, I can tell you,

00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:38.322
without even looking--
and I have a little app

00:22:38.322 --> 00:22:40.734
for that-- exactly how
much energy we're using.

00:22:40.734 --> 00:22:43.540
And it's probably less
than 200 watts right now,

00:22:43.540 --> 00:22:45.840
less than a few of these
light bulbs in this room.

00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:47.977
Our entire house is
operating off of that right

00:22:47.977 --> 00:22:49.130
now, because nobody's home.

00:22:52.660 --> 00:22:54.660
That little thing over
there on the corner, that

00:22:54.660 --> 00:22:57.660
is the one old thing
that we still have.

00:22:57.660 --> 00:23:01.270
That was my clock radio that I
bought in law school in 1992.

00:23:01.270 --> 00:23:03.580
And just plugging that in,
doing a little math on it,

00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:05.380
I realized that actually
uses more energy

00:23:05.380 --> 00:23:08.000
throughout the year than the
TV set up on the upper right

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:08.540
corner.

00:23:08.540 --> 00:23:09.940
So it's not about
sacrificing, saying

00:23:09.940 --> 00:23:12.620
you can't watch Gangnam Style on
your YouTube, on your smart TV

00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:13.571
anymore.

00:23:13.571 --> 00:23:15.320
You got to replace the
little clock radios

00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:17.570
and you've got to make
everything else more efficient,

00:23:17.570 --> 00:23:20.480
and get better stuff, a
little bit more comfort,

00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:23.540
and you control them to where
they're only using electricity

00:23:23.540 --> 00:23:26.480
when they're delivering
you a service.

00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:28.060
And that's the real challenge.

00:23:28.060 --> 00:23:28.947
Lighting.

00:23:28.947 --> 00:23:31.280
You can get the most efficient
light bulbs in the world.

00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:33.740
But the best thing you can do
is harvest daylight for free.

00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:38.610
It's better lighting, and
there's not much to it.

00:23:38.610 --> 00:23:41.720
Our house is an old house,
so it was built to harvest

00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:44.870
as much natural daylight as
possible without light bulbs.

00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:49.880
Thermostats.

00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:50.910
The world is changing.

00:23:50.910 --> 00:23:53.562
A couple of guys left
Apple, the guys, in fact,

00:23:53.562 --> 00:23:57.454
from the team who created
the iPod and the iPhone,

00:23:57.454 --> 00:24:00.820
left Apple-- that was the time
to sell your Apple stock--

00:24:00.820 --> 00:24:03.120
and said they don't want
to make toys anymore.

00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:05.540
So they made that product
over on the right side.

00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:06.430
That's the NEST.

00:24:06.430 --> 00:24:09.480
And actually, Google is a
huge investor in the NEST.

00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:11.522
Because they realizes
that this little product,

00:24:11.522 --> 00:24:13.730
with an algorithm that knows
the outdoor temperature,

00:24:13.730 --> 00:24:16.285
indoor temperature, humidity,
indoor and outdoors,

00:24:16.285 --> 00:24:19.030
and it can optimize
exactly when you

00:24:19.030 --> 00:24:21.270
need it to be the
temperature that you need it.

00:24:21.270 --> 00:24:23.620
So at 7 o'clock, when your
programmable thermostat

00:24:23.620 --> 00:24:26.990
kicks up to 70 degrees
and starts to work,

00:24:26.990 --> 00:24:29.880
this one will have
it at 70 degrees.

00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:33.270
Because at 4 in the morning, it
knows it's 20 degrees outside.

00:24:33.270 --> 00:24:35.570
I need to turn on
the heat right now.

00:24:35.570 --> 00:24:37.240
And at 7 o'clock,
it's going to be

00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:39.186
exactly the temperature
you want it to be.

00:24:39.186 --> 00:24:40.560
So you've optimized
your comfort,

00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:42.890
but you've used as little
energy as possible.

00:24:42.890 --> 00:24:44.765
Because the next day,
when it's 30 degrees,

00:24:44.765 --> 00:24:47.640
just five degrees warmer, it
might kick on 15 minutes later,

00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:48.945
because it knows that.

00:24:48.945 --> 00:24:51.070
And it's going to know
exactly what time to kick on

00:24:51.070 --> 00:24:53.280
to keep you optimally
comfortable.

00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:56.880
So these little tiny
devices that are $200, $250,

00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:58.750
can save huge amounts of energy.

00:24:58.750 --> 00:25:00.708
You can imagine what
happens when you put these

00:25:00.708 --> 00:25:03.060
into 130 million homes.

00:25:03.060 --> 00:25:03.560
Lighting.

00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:06.190
If there's a light bulb
on in an unoccupied room,

00:25:06.190 --> 00:25:08.230
you're paying 100% of
the cost, but you're

00:25:08.230 --> 00:25:09.590
getting zero benefit.

00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:11.890
Who does that?

00:25:11.890 --> 00:25:14.990
That's like leasing a car
that you never get to use.

00:25:14.990 --> 00:25:18.760
So California
requires all new homes

00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:20.805
to have occupancy sensors
in all the lights.

00:25:20.805 --> 00:25:25.130
And every switch in
our home has a sensor.

00:25:25.130 --> 00:25:27.300
Our lives are so much
easier, because of it.

00:25:27.300 --> 00:25:29.441
We don't have to worry
about turning lights off

00:25:29.441 --> 00:25:31.690
when we go out of the kitchen
carrying loads of stuff,

00:25:31.690 --> 00:25:33.280
or going down to the basement
with a load of laundry.

00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:34.300
They'll turn off for us.

00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:35.966
And I don't have to
teach my 4-year-old,

00:25:35.966 --> 00:25:37.430
go back and turn off the lights.

00:25:37.430 --> 00:25:39.040
She knows how to
turn off the lights.

00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:41.090
But if she doesn't, that's OK.

00:25:41.090 --> 00:25:43.000
They're going to turn
off by themselves.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:45.080
The light bulbs that
we put in, we make sure

00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:46.790
are the most efficient
ones available.

00:25:46.790 --> 00:25:49.290
The incandescent light bulb,
we won't talk about it anymore,

00:25:49.290 --> 00:25:51.460
because it's infinitely more
expensive than the other two

00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:52.100
options.

00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:53.670
The one in the
middle is actually

00:25:53.670 --> 00:25:55.135
what I call the 8-track
cassette of lighting,

00:25:55.135 --> 00:25:57.850
because that thing's going to be
gone within a couple of years.

00:25:57.850 --> 00:25:59.225
On the right side,
that's already

00:25:59.225 --> 00:26:01.175
the most affordable
light bulb on the planet.

00:26:01.175 --> 00:26:03.270
Because over the life
cycle of that light bulb,

00:26:03.270 --> 00:26:04.935
although it costs
$15, the energy

00:26:04.935 --> 00:26:06.960
you're going to
spend on it, and it's

00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:09.655
going to last you
in a home over 20,

00:26:09.655 --> 00:26:13.010
25 years, a single light bulb.

00:26:13.010 --> 00:26:15.382
It ends up being the
cheapest bulb on the planet.

00:26:15.382 --> 00:26:17.590
And you can get them at Home
Depot, Lowe's, any store

00:26:17.590 --> 00:26:18.140
right now.

00:26:18.140 --> 00:26:19.849
And the prices are
coming down every day.

00:26:19.849 --> 00:26:21.765
But the biggest place
that we're losing energy

00:26:21.765 --> 00:26:23.940
and we're really getting
screwed is in the shower.

00:26:23.940 --> 00:26:25.206
Now I know what
you're thinking, you

00:26:25.206 --> 00:26:27.414
shouldn't be using electricity
in the shower, anyway.

00:26:27.414 --> 00:26:28.880
But you are.

00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:30.610
That's all hot water in there.

00:26:30.610 --> 00:26:33.300
So by replacing shower heads
with the most optimized

00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:37.190
water-sense certified, really
efficient shower heads,

00:26:37.190 --> 00:26:40.470
like they're using at
Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas,

00:26:40.470 --> 00:26:42.359
where instead of using
2.5 gallons a minute,

00:26:42.359 --> 00:26:44.150
you're using 1.5 gallons
a minute of water,

00:26:44.150 --> 00:26:47.890
a family of four is now saving
16,000 gallons of hot water

00:26:47.890 --> 00:26:50.140
just by changing a
little $40 device.

00:26:53.790 --> 00:26:55.760
And that's all energy.

00:26:55.760 --> 00:26:59.824
So the appliances in the house.

00:26:59.824 --> 00:27:01.865
Right now, and that's
actually the stove we have.

00:27:04.195 --> 00:27:06.695
Hopefully, we're going to be
changing this out very quickly,

00:27:06.695 --> 00:27:08.000
in the next couple of weeks.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:11.320
That gas stove operates
at 45% efficiency.

00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:14.380
It's got three
pilot lights on it

00:27:14.380 --> 00:27:16.955
that actually cost
us more energy

00:27:16.955 --> 00:27:18.330
than cooking
throughout the year.

00:27:18.330 --> 00:27:19.750
It's from 1969.

00:27:19.750 --> 00:27:20.630
It's totally bad ass.

00:27:20.630 --> 00:27:22.050
It looks really cool.

00:27:22.050 --> 00:27:26.232
But if we replace it with this
even bad ass-er looking unit--

00:27:26.232 --> 00:27:26.815
wait a minute.

00:27:26.815 --> 00:27:27.451
Oh, my God.

00:27:27.451 --> 00:27:27.950
It's gone.

00:27:27.950 --> 00:27:29.902
No, it's still there.

00:27:29.902 --> 00:27:32.370
This is an induction cook top.

00:27:32.370 --> 00:27:35.878
Sadly, this one model is only
available in the UK right now.

00:27:35.878 --> 00:27:38.240
But the induction cook top
operates at 95% efficiency

00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:43.940
and will use electricity without
burning any carbon at all.

00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:45.740
Then we upgrade the water tanks.

00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:47.510
We get the most
efficient water tanks.

00:27:47.510 --> 00:27:49.270
And now that we're
all- electric family,

00:27:49.270 --> 00:27:51.170
Ford decided, hey,
we're going to roll out

00:27:51.170 --> 00:27:52.270
an all-electric vehicle.

00:27:52.270 --> 00:27:54.311
We're going to introduce
the all-American family.

00:27:54.311 --> 00:27:56.210
They put my wife and
I in the centerfold.

00:27:56.210 --> 00:27:59.024
And no jokes about
being a centerfold.

00:27:59.024 --> 00:28:00.690
That's my daughter
you're talking about.

00:28:03.740 --> 00:28:06.364
Now Ford's going to be a little
upset with the next photograph.

00:28:06.364 --> 00:28:11.246
Because that's the Chevy Volt
that we got a few months later.

00:28:11.246 --> 00:28:13.380
So we're using some
of that excess energy

00:28:13.380 --> 00:28:15.910
to dump into the Volt,
where that red arrow is,

00:28:15.910 --> 00:28:18.570
that's our electric
charging station.

00:28:18.570 --> 00:28:21.700
And right at that moment, it's
drawing power directly off

00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:24.210
of the solar panels on
the roof and filling up

00:28:24.210 --> 00:28:26.360
with tanks of sunshine
right into the car.

00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:28.590
So then we restored
all of our own windows.

00:28:28.590 --> 00:28:30.486
We tightened them up
as much as possible.

00:28:30.486 --> 00:28:32.860
We did apply for historic
preservation tax credits, which

00:28:32.860 --> 00:28:34.869
meant we had to keep
the historic integrity

00:28:34.869 --> 00:28:35.410
of the house.

00:28:35.410 --> 00:28:37.580
It was not a gut rehab.

00:28:37.580 --> 00:28:40.200
We only put R-13 in the walls.

00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:43.830
And for the non-building
geeks, that's not much.

00:28:43.830 --> 00:28:45.400
It's not even what
current code is.

00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:47.066
But that's what could
fit into the wall.

00:28:47.066 --> 00:28:49.700
So we just put dense packed
cellulose into the wall.

00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:54.190
We put minimal insulation,
actually, by modern standards,

00:28:54.190 --> 00:28:55.500
into the attic.

00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:57.920
But we made sure the attic
was sealed really well,

00:28:57.920 --> 00:28:59.460
so we got little air leakage.

00:28:59.460 --> 00:29:01.710
And then, because the
house became so tight

00:29:01.710 --> 00:29:04.465
with the new insulated
windows that we

00:29:04.465 --> 00:29:06.644
were able to weatherstrip
the old windows

00:29:06.644 --> 00:29:08.810
and restore the old ones,
rather than replacing them

00:29:08.810 --> 00:29:09.990
with new materials.

00:29:09.990 --> 00:29:11.979
The house was so
tight that we actually

00:29:11.979 --> 00:29:13.520
went below the
standards where you're

00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:15.353
required to have
mechanical ventilation when

00:29:15.353 --> 00:29:16.590
the windows are closed.

00:29:16.590 --> 00:29:19.720
So in the attic, we also have
an energy recovery ventilator.

00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:23.456
Then in the ground
we dug three wells,

00:29:23.456 --> 00:29:24.830
which you use for
a heat exchange

00:29:24.830 --> 00:29:25.913
for our geothermal system.

00:29:25.913 --> 00:29:27.770
And we have the most
efficient heating

00:29:27.770 --> 00:29:29.810
and cooling system
on the planet.

00:29:29.810 --> 00:29:34.050
And then, we put a bunch of
solar panels on the roof.

00:29:34.050 --> 00:29:37.164
And we powered
nuclear power, but we

00:29:37.164 --> 00:29:38.580
made sure we put
the nuclear power

00:29:38.580 --> 00:29:40.450
plant 93 million miles away.

00:29:40.450 --> 00:29:43.730
And that's the only downside,
we powered it wirelessly.

00:29:43.730 --> 00:29:45.430
So let's go back to
some of this math

00:29:45.430 --> 00:29:48.360
that we started with
at the beginning.

00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:50.600
290, that's the
parts per million

00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:54.500
in the atmosphere for 800,000
years of human history,

00:29:54.500 --> 00:29:58.380
until about 1751, the beginning
of the Industrial Revolution.

00:29:58.380 --> 00:29:59.820
And just about
that time, where we

00:29:59.820 --> 00:30:05.380
start discovering coal and steam
engines and everything else,

00:30:05.380 --> 00:30:06.930
that number starts
to tick up, starts

00:30:06.930 --> 00:30:08.770
to go above 290
parts per million

00:30:08.770 --> 00:30:12.260
for the first time in
over 800,000 years.

00:30:12.260 --> 00:30:15.870
This is the number, again,
that James Hansen says

00:30:15.870 --> 00:30:18.520
we need to stay under if we're
going to stabilize the planet.

00:30:21.610 --> 00:30:25.580
This is the number where
we're hit yesterday,

00:30:25.580 --> 00:30:29.139
398 parts per million carbon
dioxide in the atmosphere.

00:30:29.139 --> 00:30:30.930
And they're concerned
that it will probably

00:30:30.930 --> 00:30:35.460
hit 400 by May of this year.

00:30:35.460 --> 00:30:38.860
That correlates to a 1 degree
global temperature average

00:30:38.860 --> 00:30:44.400
Celsius since the beginning
of the Industrial Revolution.

00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:47.500
So in 100 years, we've raised
the global temperature,

00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:48.896
on average, about 1 degree.

00:30:48.896 --> 00:30:50.020
It doesn't sound like much.

00:30:50.020 --> 00:30:53.740
But to put that in perspective,
negative 1 degree Celsius

00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:56.080
gave us the Ice Age.

00:30:56.080 --> 00:30:58.320
So negative 1 degree
gives us the Ice Age.

00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:02.775
And this is what a
positive 1 degree gives us.

00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:18.395
PricewaterhouseCoopers is a
consulting firm out of the UK.

00:31:22.270 --> 00:31:25.030
Again, not a bunch of hippies
bathing in their pasta water,

00:31:25.030 --> 00:31:27.331
a bunch of conservative,
suited business folks

00:31:27.331 --> 00:31:29.330
who are trying to provide
the best data they can

00:31:29.330 --> 00:31:30.871
to their clients
about what they need

00:31:30.871 --> 00:31:34.740
to be looking for moving forward
and what they need to expect,

00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:37.665
and how they need to change
the way they do business.

00:31:37.665 --> 00:31:39.540
And so the numbers they
looked at, they said,

00:31:39.540 --> 00:31:42.320
look, if we're really going
to decarbonize and stay

00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:45.470
below 450 parts per
million, which they say

00:31:45.470 --> 00:31:47.240
is really the cap.

00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:49.210
You should be at
a level below 350,

00:31:49.210 --> 00:31:52.222
but let's stay at
least below 450,

00:31:52.222 --> 00:31:55.880
because we're headed there, that
we need to reduce our carbon

00:31:55.880 --> 00:32:02.966
emissions by 5.1% every single
year through the year 2050.

00:32:02.966 --> 00:32:09.115
Now sadly, from
2010 and 2011, we

00:32:09.115 --> 00:32:15.078
were only doing that by
about 0.7% decline each year

00:32:15.078 --> 00:32:18.810
that we were reducing
our carbon intensity.

00:32:18.810 --> 00:32:21.510
So they did a little study, and
they just assumed, all right,

00:32:21.510 --> 00:32:26.220
let's say we just do 1.6%
reduction of carbon intensity

00:32:26.220 --> 00:32:31.790
every single year, where
will we be by the year 2050?

00:32:31.790 --> 00:32:35.052
And that's the number
they came up with.

00:32:42.372 --> 00:32:44.232
That's my daughter Jane.

00:32:47.390 --> 00:32:50.568
She'll be 42 in the year 2050.

00:32:50.568 --> 00:32:56.638
Little baby Andrew, who you just
saw in the back, will be 37.

00:32:56.638 --> 00:32:58.054
We know how to do
the right thing.

00:32:58.054 --> 00:33:00.990
We know what is possible.

00:33:00.990 --> 00:33:01.880
Google is doing it.

00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:03.520
The US Army is doing it.

00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:06.965
Even Walmart is doing it.

00:33:06.965 --> 00:33:09.324
But we don't have a lot
of time to get there.

00:33:09.324 --> 00:33:11.590
We've got to get this right.

00:33:11.590 --> 00:33:13.170
The margin for
error here is slim.

00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:18.710
Bill Bryson, in his
latest book, "At Home,"

00:33:18.710 --> 00:33:20.270
said that the greatest
possible irony

00:33:20.270 --> 00:33:23.805
would be that our endless quest
to fill our lives with comfort

00:33:23.805 --> 00:33:27.770
and happiness that we created
a world that had neither.

00:33:27.770 --> 00:33:29.910
But I really think that
it's a false choice.

00:33:29.910 --> 00:33:33.230
It's not a choice between
comfort and happiness,

00:33:33.230 --> 00:33:34.290
nor decarbonization.

00:33:34.290 --> 00:33:36.630
Because the reality is that
when we do these things,

00:33:36.630 --> 00:33:39.870
we really decide what are the
things that make us happy?

00:33:39.870 --> 00:33:42.447
Love, friendship, family,
growing your own food,

00:33:42.447 --> 00:33:47.500
the satisfaction of eating
a tomato off the vine,

00:33:47.500 --> 00:33:51.460
riding your bike, being
outdoors, picnicking,

00:33:51.460 --> 00:33:54.180
these little things, if
we really pay attention

00:33:54.180 --> 00:33:57.985
to those things, rather
than just over consumption

00:33:57.985 --> 00:34:01.360
and waste, those are the things
that truly make us happy,

00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:05.030
that that's the path
that we need to be on.

00:34:05.030 --> 00:34:07.366
Bloomberg did a
little calculation,

00:34:07.366 --> 00:34:09.909
rising that there's enough
rooftops in America,

00:34:09.909 --> 00:34:11.790
just on residential
homes, to power

00:34:11.790 --> 00:34:14.035
all of our current
electricity needs.

00:34:14.035 --> 00:34:17.489
With no further reduction,
no efficiency gains,

00:34:17.489 --> 00:34:21.140
there's enough rooftop space
to give us all the electricity

00:34:21.140 --> 00:34:22.190
that we need.

00:34:22.190 --> 00:34:24.199
Now that's just electricity.

00:34:24.199 --> 00:34:28.300
But here's a project that I'm
working on up in Travers City.

00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:31.679
That's a Habitat for
Humanity project.

00:34:31.679 --> 00:34:32.830
Affordable housing.

00:34:32.830 --> 00:34:35.460
10 homes that will
be net zero energy.

00:34:35.460 --> 00:34:37.250
So we're proving
across the country

00:34:37.250 --> 00:34:40.120
that net zero houses
and net zero buildings

00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:43.290
are available and possible
in every single size,

00:34:43.290 --> 00:34:47.379
in every single climate, and
in every single price range.

00:34:47.379 --> 00:34:49.920
This is another home here in
Ann Arbor that we're working on,

00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:54.630
a 1949 ranch house that
will be net zero energy.

00:34:54.630 --> 00:34:59.160
This is a building in San
Francisco, the Exploratorium

00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:00.415
Science Museum.

00:35:00.415 --> 00:35:03.055
They've just
restored an old pier

00:35:03.055 --> 00:35:07.620
down by the wharf that
is 300,000 square feet

00:35:07.620 --> 00:35:09.760
and will be net zero energy.

00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:12.100
And then we're taking our
home even one step further

00:35:12.100 --> 00:35:14.790
and working with students at the
University of Michigan BLUElab

00:35:14.790 --> 00:35:18.750
to have the house certified as
part of the Living Buildings

00:35:18.750 --> 00:35:20.680
Challenge, which will
mean that the house will

00:35:20.680 --> 00:35:22.960
be able to harvest all
of its own water, all

00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:27.530
of its own energy,
have zero waste,

00:35:27.530 --> 00:35:30.879
and be restorative
to the community.

00:35:30.879 --> 00:35:32.420
And there's a building
out in Seattle

00:35:32.420 --> 00:35:33.710
that was just moved into.

00:35:33.710 --> 00:35:35.490
This is the Bullet
Center office building,

00:35:35.490 --> 00:35:37.100
over 50,000 square feet.

00:35:37.100 --> 00:35:39.385
Again, harvest all
its own energy, water

00:35:39.385 --> 00:35:42.734
and manage all of its own waste.

00:35:42.734 --> 00:35:44.400
And these are buildings
that are getting

00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:48.540
more comfortable
and restorative.

00:35:48.540 --> 00:35:51.430
And the exciting thing
is, is that if we

00:35:51.430 --> 00:35:56.430
can do this right
here, in Michigan,

00:35:56.430 --> 00:35:57.930
then anybody can do it.

00:35:57.930 --> 00:36:01.750
And if anybody can do it, that
means everybody can do it.

00:36:01.750 --> 00:36:04.390
And that includes you.

00:36:04.390 --> 00:36:06.714
Thanks for having me here.

00:36:06.714 --> 00:36:13.169
[APPLAUSE]

00:36:13.169 --> 00:36:13.960
MATT GROCOFF: Sure.

00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:14.770
Yeah, yeah.

00:36:14.770 --> 00:36:16.840
Just know that the longer
you take for questions,

00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:19.630
the less time I have to
get out to Lake Michigan

00:36:19.630 --> 00:36:23.170
and go sailing.

00:36:23.170 --> 00:36:24.490
Yeah.

00:36:24.490 --> 00:36:29.750
AUDIENCE: So a lot of the--
you talked about a [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:29.750 --> 00:36:30.650
America.

00:36:30.650 --> 00:36:32.900
Western European countries
maybe over the last decade,

00:36:32.900 --> 00:36:34.316
there have been a
lot of subsidies

00:36:34.316 --> 00:36:37.295
to do retro fits
of various types

00:36:37.295 --> 00:36:39.003
of commercial and
residential facilities,

00:36:39.003 --> 00:36:40.887
with solar energy
and things like that.

00:36:43.713 --> 00:36:47.381
Is there any way of calculating
how impactful that's been,

00:36:47.381 --> 00:36:50.600
how beneficial that's been, and
whether that model works here?

00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:52.680
How much do you know
about how feasible it

00:36:52.680 --> 00:36:54.929
is to make the rooftops--

00:36:54.929 --> 00:36:55.720
MATT GROCOFF: Yeah.

00:36:55.720 --> 00:36:57.210
Well, one of the things
they've done in Germany

00:36:57.210 --> 00:36:59.185
is that they really
democratized the grid.

00:36:59.185 --> 00:37:01.230
As free as we are
in this country,

00:37:01.230 --> 00:37:04.560
we don't get to
own our own energy.

00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:06.367
Because a century
ago, we decided

00:37:06.367 --> 00:37:08.075
that whoever was going
to make that grid,

00:37:08.075 --> 00:37:09.540
it was going to be
at great expense.

00:37:09.540 --> 00:37:11.706
So just like the railroads,
we gave them monopolies.

00:37:11.706 --> 00:37:13.820
And we've been
trying to figure out

00:37:13.820 --> 00:37:15.720
how to manage that ever since.

00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:19.870
So we have this really
old, outdated grid system

00:37:19.870 --> 00:37:22.420
of electricity that's
like a Christmas tree.

00:37:22.420 --> 00:37:25.070
If one part goes out, you lose
the entire eastern seaboard,

00:37:25.070 --> 00:37:27.375
like we did a few years ago.

00:37:27.375 --> 00:37:31.000
If Google wanted to use
all of this roof space

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:33.980
and sell the energy to
some of the other floors

00:37:33.980 --> 00:37:37.810
or the building next door, you
wouldn't be allowed to do that.

00:37:37.810 --> 00:37:41.105
So the utility company
owns the energy.

00:37:41.105 --> 00:37:44.200
If you put excess
onto it, they get it.

00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:48.296
We were lucky enough to get into
a program that was around just

00:37:48.296 --> 00:37:50.620
for a couple of years,
where DTE was going

00:37:50.620 --> 00:37:54.550
to buy our solar energy,
any excess that we use.

00:37:54.550 --> 00:37:56.335
So we're benefiting
greatly financially.

00:37:56.335 --> 00:38:00.010
And that's what's available
in Germany, where there

00:38:00.010 --> 00:38:04.710
was a day this past summer, last
year, where Germany, over half

00:38:04.710 --> 00:38:07.570
of the energy
during this day was

00:38:07.570 --> 00:38:09.380
produced by renewable energy.

00:38:09.380 --> 00:38:15.010
They have a goal to take the
entire nation to zero carbon

00:38:15.010 --> 00:38:18.295
emissions, to be powered
completely by renewable energy,

00:38:18.295 --> 00:38:21.062
not including nuclear,
by the year 2030.

00:38:21.062 --> 00:38:23.805
So they want to decommission
all of their nuclear plants

00:38:23.805 --> 00:38:24.305
by 2030.

00:38:24.305 --> 00:38:26.030
And that's a really
ambitious goal.

00:38:26.030 --> 00:38:29.010
Well, what's happenening is,
so companies like Google,

00:38:29.010 --> 00:38:32.505
and the Army, and
Walmart, in Germany,

00:38:32.505 --> 00:38:35.220
who have really bought into
this idea, all of a sudden,

00:38:35.220 --> 00:38:39.140
there's just an extraordinary
amount of innovation profit

00:38:39.140 --> 00:38:42.510
that's coming from it,
savings that has really

00:38:42.510 --> 00:38:45.465
sparked all kinds
of imagination.

00:38:45.465 --> 00:38:46.840
And people who
work for companies

00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:49.942
that are involved in that
report just being happy.

00:38:49.942 --> 00:38:51.400
They actually show
up to work more.

00:38:53.940 --> 00:38:55.780
So it certainly
is possible here.

00:38:55.780 --> 00:38:59.015
And states here that have been
the most progressive, places

00:38:59.015 --> 00:39:02.187
like California,
New Jersey, Ohio,

00:39:02.187 --> 00:39:04.020
have been really
aggressive with this stuff,

00:39:04.020 --> 00:39:06.870
are getting a lot of solar.

00:39:06.870 --> 00:39:09.217
And Germany, I forgot
what the percentage is,

00:39:09.217 --> 00:39:10.800
but I was just reading
this yesterday.

00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:14.900
And I believe it's-- I think
it's almost half of the energy

00:39:14.900 --> 00:39:18.340
is actually owned by
individuals and farmers.

00:39:18.340 --> 00:39:19.959
So that's an
extraordinary model.

00:39:19.959 --> 00:39:21.750
And when that happens,
it can really do it.

00:39:21.750 --> 00:39:25.120
And the other thing is
to put a price on carbon.

00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:28.040
Because right now,
the price we're paying

00:39:28.040 --> 00:39:30.620
doesn't get onto the
accounting sheet.

00:39:30.620 --> 00:39:31.930
So that's all externalized.

00:39:31.930 --> 00:39:33.850
And we have to
internalize those costs

00:39:33.850 --> 00:39:38.830
and pay for what
that really costs.

00:39:38.830 --> 00:39:41.890
AUDIENCE: My dad us like--
he hates solar energy,

00:39:41.890 --> 00:39:42.810
for some reason.

00:39:42.810 --> 00:39:46.500
And his argument is
always that whenever

00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:52.090
he reads about these solar
cells that they cost more energy

00:39:52.090 --> 00:39:55.070
to produce than that they
get during their lifetime.

00:39:55.070 --> 00:39:57.350
Have you done the calculation?

00:39:57.350 --> 00:39:59.470
MATT GROCOFF: Yeah,
it's not true.

00:39:59.470 --> 00:40:00.800
It's not even worth answering.

00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:01.930
It's just not true.

00:40:01.930 --> 00:40:03.940
That's just--
honestly, I don't know

00:40:03.940 --> 00:40:07.215
what the motives are
for that world of people

00:40:07.215 --> 00:40:10.920
who are trying to debunk these
technologies that are proven.

00:40:10.920 --> 00:40:13.500
There are life cycle assessments
on all of this stuff.

00:40:13.500 --> 00:40:15.620
And certainly for
certain processes.

00:40:15.620 --> 00:40:17.924
Some manufacturers are
more efficient than others.

00:40:17.924 --> 00:40:19.840
There's actually a
standard now in California,

00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:25.005
where this non-profit group is
rating solar panels from cradle

00:40:25.005 --> 00:40:28.770
to grave, of what kind
of chemicals they use,

00:40:28.770 --> 00:40:31.070
what their processes
are, how much energy

00:40:31.070 --> 00:40:33.200
is used to make them, and so on.

00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:35.520
You can use solar energy
to make solar panels.

00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:40.180
So it's just silly.

00:40:40.180 --> 00:40:45.872
AUDIENCE: So how do we get a
solar roof, if we want one?

00:40:45.872 --> 00:40:47.830
MATT GROCOFF: Honestly,
it's tough in Michigan,

00:40:47.830 --> 00:40:50.550
unless you have the
upfront capital to do it.

00:40:50.550 --> 00:40:53.050
Over time, it will
absolutely pay itself back.

00:40:53.050 --> 00:40:55.090
There's no question about that.

00:40:55.090 --> 00:40:56.820
But when the costs
are unequalized,

00:40:56.820 --> 00:41:00.150
and if you're able to make
more energy than you can use,

00:41:00.150 --> 00:41:02.340
there's no feed-in
tariff in Michigan.

00:41:02.340 --> 00:41:05.150
There's no real
incentives for it

00:41:05.150 --> 00:41:11.650
to pay for itself
in the short-term.

00:41:11.650 --> 00:41:14.800
But it is possible, in fact--
who was it I talked to earlier?

00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:19.007
They were getting some solar
panels this week, actually.

00:41:19.007 --> 00:41:20.590
But you can email
me and I'll give you

00:41:20.590 --> 00:41:22.423
the names of some solar
companies right here

00:41:22.423 --> 00:41:23.310
in the area.

00:41:23.310 --> 00:41:23.840
So there's definitely plenty.

00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:25.090
I don't want to discourage you.

00:41:25.090 --> 00:41:26.200
Because there's plenty of
homes that are doing it now.

00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:28.100
And there are ways of doing it.

00:41:28.100 --> 00:41:30.950
You can actually be creative
and sell your renewable energy

00:41:30.950 --> 00:41:34.030
credits in other states,
and all this other stuff.

00:41:34.030 --> 00:41:35.230
So it's getting crazy.

00:41:35.230 --> 00:41:40.530
And the price of solar is
dropping like computers.

00:41:40.530 --> 00:41:42.380
It's the same curve, actually.

00:41:42.380 --> 00:41:45.980
Whereas our was about, I
think it was $7 a watt.

00:41:45.980 --> 00:41:49.646
It's down to $3 a watt,
since we put our panels up.

00:41:49.646 --> 00:41:52.220
So a significant reduction.

00:41:52.220 --> 00:41:54.980
AUDIENCE: What's the total
cost of everything you've done,

00:41:54.980 --> 00:41:58.950
and how much of that was
subsidized by DTE programs

00:41:58.950 --> 00:41:59.809
at the time, or--

00:41:59.809 --> 00:42:00.600
MATT GROCOFF: Yeah.

00:42:03.055 --> 00:42:05.430
Well, actually, the only thing
that was really subsidized

00:42:05.430 --> 00:42:06.670
was the solar.

00:42:06.670 --> 00:42:10.020
We have 30% federal tax credit.

00:42:10.020 --> 00:42:14.935
We got about $19,000 back on
the solar rate from DTE upfront.

00:42:14.935 --> 00:42:16.825
So that went directly
to the installer.

00:42:16.825 --> 00:42:19.820
Then we get renewable energy
credits on the back end.

00:42:19.820 --> 00:42:22.370
So the solar array itself
ended up being out of pocket,

00:42:22.370 --> 00:42:25.260
after all those reductions,
only about $15,000.

00:42:25.260 --> 00:42:27.890
So while our good
friends bought a car

00:42:27.890 --> 00:42:30.860
about the same time we were
installing the solar panels,

00:42:30.860 --> 00:42:33.030
five years later,
they have a used car

00:42:33.030 --> 00:42:35.610
and we have free
energy for life.

00:42:35.610 --> 00:42:37.075
And now we have a Volt, too.

00:42:40.580 --> 00:42:46.400
But the whole rehab itself,
including the incentives

00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:50.040
for the solar, was
$105,000, because we

00:42:50.040 --> 00:42:51.385
did a lot of the work ourselves.

00:42:51.385 --> 00:42:53.660
That included an
electrician, painters

00:42:53.660 --> 00:42:58.530
to restore the outside of the
house, plumbing, new electric,

00:42:58.530 --> 00:43:01.880
the solar, the
geothermal was a big one.

00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:03.510
But when we put
the geothermal in,

00:43:03.510 --> 00:43:05.970
there was no-- it wasn't even
a tax incentive for that.

00:43:05.970 --> 00:43:07.760
But there was still
enough of a pay back

00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:10.290
for us, because we knew we were
going to stay in the house,

00:43:10.290 --> 00:43:12.790
that it was going to be the
most efficient and comfortable

00:43:12.790 --> 00:43:14.500
that we could have.

00:43:14.500 --> 00:43:20.670
And then we did get a historic
preservation tax credit,

00:43:20.670 --> 00:43:22.740
which hopefully will
come in the mail

00:43:22.740 --> 00:43:26.760
this next week, for about
a little over $20,000.

00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:29.310
So that's the most significant
thing we've gotten was

00:43:29.310 --> 00:43:32.007
we were rewarded for
restoring a historic house.

00:43:32.007 --> 00:43:33.840
I could do a whole hour
lecture on that one,

00:43:33.840 --> 00:43:36.672
though, because we almost
didn't get it, because of some--

00:43:38.910 --> 00:43:41.160
AUDIENCE: Could I ask somewhat
of a follow-up question

00:43:41.160 --> 00:43:41.660
to that?

00:43:41.660 --> 00:43:45.460
It seems like, as you
said, the short-term costs

00:43:45.460 --> 00:43:49.316
are a significant barrier to
something that is obviously

00:43:49.316 --> 00:43:52.540
going to pay for itself
over the long run.

00:43:55.140 --> 00:43:58.830
What are your thoughts on
models that you think work well.

00:43:58.830 --> 00:44:01.904
And I know there's been a lot
of [INAUDIBLE] subsidies from

00:44:01.904 --> 00:44:05.460
solar companies
that are no longer--

00:44:05.460 --> 00:44:09.066
I'm trying to think about, it
seems like there could be some

00:44:09.066 --> 00:44:11.850
sort of way that somebody who
had a lot of capital could make

00:44:11.850 --> 00:44:16.555
this a very profitable
program to just subsidize--

00:44:16.555 --> 00:44:17.680
MATT GROCOFF: And they are.

00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:19.221
There are solar
leasing programs that

00:44:19.221 --> 00:44:21.990
are very successful in
other states, where they

00:44:21.990 --> 00:44:25.200
own the solar panels, and
they're leasing you the panel.

00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:27.232
So that way they get
around who owns the energy.

00:44:27.232 --> 00:44:28.690
They're not selling
you the energy,

00:44:28.690 --> 00:44:30.235
they're selling me
the power plant.

00:44:30.235 --> 00:44:32.110
They're not even selling
you the power plant,

00:44:32.110 --> 00:44:33.906
they own the power
plant on your roof.

00:44:33.906 --> 00:44:35.530
You lease it back from them.

00:44:35.530 --> 00:44:37.780
And your payments
each month are lower

00:44:37.780 --> 00:44:40.160
than what you would be paying
if you bought electricity

00:44:40.160 --> 00:44:42.220
from the utility company.

00:44:42.220 --> 00:44:45.160
So that's one model.

00:44:45.160 --> 00:44:47.870
But all of this really has
to change dramatically.

00:44:47.870 --> 00:44:50.120
We can't just keep
throwing money

00:44:50.120 --> 00:44:52.700
at this company or that
company and hoping it works.

00:44:52.700 --> 00:44:55.300
We really have to put a
price-- the reason solar is

00:44:55.300 --> 00:44:58.480
at a disadvantage is because
the other forms of fossil fuels

00:44:58.480 --> 00:45:00.950
are artificially
cheap, because we

00:45:00.950 --> 00:45:03.070
don't pay for the cost of that.

00:45:03.070 --> 00:45:05.945
You don't see in the cost of oil
spills in the Kalamazoo River

00:45:05.945 --> 00:45:07.880
or in the Gulf of Mexico.

00:45:07.880 --> 00:45:10.265
You don't see the cost of
the invisible carbon dioxide

00:45:10.265 --> 00:45:13.900
and methane and everything else
that goes up to the atmosphere.

00:45:13.900 --> 00:45:15.000
Nobody pays that.

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:17.170
That's just the tragedy
of the [INAUDIBLE].

00:45:17.170 --> 00:45:19.600
So if we actually
calculate those costs

00:45:19.600 --> 00:45:23.190
and see what they
really are, then

00:45:23.190 --> 00:45:29.320
all of a sudden how we create
our energy really changes.

00:45:29.320 --> 00:45:31.225
And so that's why
Germany is, really, I

00:45:31.225 --> 00:45:33.920
think, the best model
we've got so far for it.

00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:35.490
And they're on target.

00:45:35.490 --> 00:45:37.300
They'll do it by 2030.

00:45:37.300 --> 00:45:41.340
And we could all do it, if
we have the political will.

00:45:41.340 --> 00:45:41.940
Anybody else?

00:45:44.940 --> 00:45:45.840
All right.

00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:46.740
Thanks, y'all.

00:45:46.740 --> 00:45:51.749
[APPLAUSE]
