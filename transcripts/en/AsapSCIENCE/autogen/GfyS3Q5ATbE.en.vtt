00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 Murder has inspired documentaries, podcasts and even games. 

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:07.040
 But our obsession with these stories made us wonder 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:12.240
 Are there certain traits or factors that make someone more likely to kill someone? 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.860
 And are you capable of murder? 

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.680
 To begin with, have you ever thought about it? 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.300
 This actually doesn't mean that much because it happens so often. 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.320
 A survey of nearly 1,000 students showed that 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.400
 76% of women and 91% of men have indicated one 

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.020
 vivid and memorable murderous thought. 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.280
 Other reports show that men are around ten and women around three 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.400
 have had murder fantasies in the past year. 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.940
 Is your heart beating faster now? 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:42.480
 Then you are probably safe :). 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.160
 A study of 710,000 participants, has the normal heart rate of men 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.260
 measured when they were eighteen years old 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.280
 as a part of a military service test. 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.300
 In the consecutive decades, the men with the lowest were normal heartbeats 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:00.300
 39% more likely than the high normal heartbeat group to commit a violent crime. 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:03.740
 Furthermore, another study found that a low heart rate 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.840
 was linked to stalk behavior. 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:08.240
 A study of murderers who plead 'not guilty',
