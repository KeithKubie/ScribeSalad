00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:03.762
FEMALE SPEAKER: So I'm really
excited to host Dr. Lissa

00:00:03.762 --> 00:00:04.670
Rankin today.

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:06.400
It's funny to say "doctor"
in front of your name.

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:06.910
DR. LISSA RANKIN: I know.

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:08.950
FEMALE SPEAKER: I call you
"Lissa." But I met Lissa

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:12.270
through a mutual friend, and
last year when I met Lissa she

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:14.650
talked about this book
that was coming out.

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:17.580
It's all about her research and
the medical world that she

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:18.320
comes from.

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.710
So this is the book, "Mind Over
Medicine." It's available

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.670
here as well for anyone
looking to purchase.

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:27.070
But first a little bit
about Dr. Rankin.

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:30.600
So Dr. Rankin is a mind-body
medicine physician, founder of

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.610
the Whole Health Medicine
Institute Training Program for

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:35.660
physicians and other health
care providers.

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.100
And is "The New York Times"
best-selling author of "Mind

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.090
Over Medicine--

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.420
Scientific Proof You Can Heal
Yourself." She is on a

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.825
grassroots mission to put the
care back in health care and

00:00:45.825 --> 00:00:48.380
to heal our broken health care
system one doctor and

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:51.190
patient at a time.

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.000
Lissa blogs at lissarankin.com
and has created two online

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.010
communities,
healhealthcarenow.com and

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:59.510
owningpink.com.

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.720
She is also the author
of two other books.

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.910
And Lissa will work on the focus
in an upcoming public

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:08.540
television special that will
appear on PBS that she just

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.780
finished taping, and she
delivered two popular TEDx

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.460
talks, which are available
on her website.

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.080
She's also on the speaking
circuit with Hay House I Can

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:18.980
Do It! conferences.

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.960
Lissa's work has also been
featured on over 30 television

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.340
shows, over 50 radio shows, and
in publications such as

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.610
"O" magazine, "The New York
Times," WebMD, and CNN.

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.710
She's also a social networking
guru, and you can follow her

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.130
on Twitter and on her blog,
which you can sign up for her

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.380
newsletter daily.

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.790
So without further ado, I will
hand it over to Lissa.

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:41.057
Thank you so much.

00:01:41.057 --> 00:01:46.200
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.705
DR. LISSA RANKIN:
Hi, everyone.

00:01:47.705 --> 00:01:50.830
It's so nice to see
you all here.

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:55.820
So I want to tell you the story
of how I ended up being

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.890
here in front of you, talking
about the things that I'm

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:59.930
going to be talking
about today.

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.140
In many ways, I'm the most
unlikely person on the planet

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.060
to be talking about how
you can heal yourself.

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.490
I was raised in a very
conventional upbringing with a

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:12.830
physician father.

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.960
I came to believe that in
order to get well, to be

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.800
healthy, you do the things that
they teach us how to do

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.360
in medical school, right?

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.730
So my definition of "health"
meant, OK, so you eat well,

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.270
you exercise daily, you get
enough sleep, you take your

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.670
vitamins, you go to your
doctor for preventive

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.960
maintenance, and you should
be healthy, right?

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.720
Well, and I had once worked in
the inner city of Chicago.

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.030
My patients were often very,
very poor, and they had very

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.950
poor health habits.

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.410
So it made sense to me that
these people were sick.

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.630
Because when I was investigating
their health

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:51.260
histories and that
sort of thing,

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.070
they were eating poorly.

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:54.710
They weren't getting
enough sleep.

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:56.200
They had many bad habits.

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.740
Often they weren't exercising
at all.

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:01.740
So it kind of made sense to me
why these people were sick.

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:05.870
Well, then I came
to Marin County.

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.280
And I'm not from Marin, so I
had no idea what kind of

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.310
people were in Marin County.

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.600
But these people are proverbial
health nuts.

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.290
I see you guys are smiling.

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:16.510
Right?

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.030
So I took a job at an
integrative medicine practice,

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.310
and my patients were eating
their vegan diets.

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.320
They were drinking their
daily green juice.

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.890
They were working out with
personal trainers.

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:29.580
They were getting eight hours
of sleep every night.

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:31.380
They were taking
20 supplements.

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.720
They were getting the best
medical care at places like

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.690
Stanford and UCSF.

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:38.940
So these people would come to
see me, and they'd have these

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.780
laundry lists of chronic
health conditions.

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:43.510
And it made no sense to me.

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:45.530
I mean, these people should be
the healthiest people on the

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:47.610
planet, and they were some
of the sickest people

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:49.110
that I'd ever met.

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:51.270
So it didn't make any sense.

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:53.500
Many of them, by the time they
had seen me, they had

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.470
optimized everything that
Western medicine had to offer.

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:59.570
So they had gone to all of their
fabulous doctors and had

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:01.650
every fabulous test out there.

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.010
So a few of them were
sort of practicing

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:06.250
some functional medicine.

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:09.880
And so some of them, I would
find the occasional lab test

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:12.960
that someone else hadn't
ordered, and I'd find some

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:15.240
abnormality that we'd
be able to treat.

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:16.579
And all of a sudden, it
would be like the

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:17.440
lights had come on.

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.120
They felt great and everything
was terrific.

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.830
But that was maybe
10% of the time.

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.270
And 90% of the time, I'd look
through everything that all

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:28.420
the other doctors had done,
and I didn't know how to

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:31.340
explain why these people
were sick.

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:32.980
So I did something
sort of radical.

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:34.380
I decided, you know what,
maybe I'm not

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:35.810
asking the right questions.

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:39.720
Maybe the answer is not in their
medical record but in

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:40.920
the rest of their life.

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:44.340
So I redid my patient intake
form, the forms that you fill

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:46.840
out when you go see
the doctor.

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.580
So I was asking all the
conventional questions, but I

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:51.060
started asking some
other questions.

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:54.250
I started asking things like,
if you could break any rule

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:56.390
and there were no consequences,
what

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:58.770
rule would you break?

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:01.110
And I started asking people
about their romantic life.

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:03.810
Are you in a relationship,
and if so, are you happy?

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:06.230
If not, do you wish you were?

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:08.630
I started asking people
about their work.

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:09.615
Do you love your job?

00:05:09.615 --> 00:05:10.930
Do you feel like
you're in touch

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:12.470
with your life's purpose?

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:16.540
Do you have a calling, and
if so, what is it?

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:18.980
And I came across some
real doozies.

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:21.870
I started asking people, if your
health condition had a

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:26.340
message to teach you, what
is it here to teach you?

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:29.700
And then the one that really
started being the mother lode

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:32.810
for me, I asked people
what does your body

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:35.070
need in order to heal?

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:37.270
Now, when I started asking that
question, I thought that

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:39.640
I would get treatment intuitions
from people, that

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:42.920
maybe they'd tell me I think
I'll skip the antidepressant

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:45.240
and we'll try the tryptophan
instead or

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:46.320
something like that.

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:48.290
And occasionally they would
say things like that.

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:50.770
But more often than not, I'd
say, what does your body need

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:52.410
in order to heal?

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:56.180
And my patients would say things
like, I need to leave

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:58.850
my abusive marriage.

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:02.940
Or I need to quit my
soul-sucking job.

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:05.660
Or I've got to get
my kid in rehab.

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:09.660
Or I've got to deal with my
aging parent and get my mom

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:11.690
out of my house.

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:14.510
Or I need to finally
write my novel.

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:16.000
And I'd say, well, great.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.880
You've just written the
prescription for yourself.

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:18.720
Go do it.

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.325
And they'd look at me and say,
well, I can't do that, that

00:06:20.325 --> 00:06:22.660
would be crazy.

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:23.630
Right?

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:27.580
So I started talking to my
patients about, well, let's

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:30.430
assume for a minute that you
just answered the question of

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:32.030
what does my body need
in order to heal

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:33.170
and that it's true.

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:35.100
What if you actually did that
thing and your health

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:36.580
conditions went away?

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:37.990
Would you be willing
to do it then?

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:40.800
And some of them would say, you
know what, actually not.

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:43.530
I'd rather be sick than
have to follow through

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:44.460
on what I just said.

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:47.410
But some of my patients started
getting really brave.

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:51.130
And so I was watching these
patients as they were going

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:53.960
out into the world and sort
of making these courageous

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:57.150
choices, often from this laundry
list of things that

00:06:57.150 --> 00:07:00.710
they've written out about the
answer to what does my body

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:02.410
need in order to heal.

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:04.910
And I started witnessing my
patients having these

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:09.280
incredible, spontaneous
remissions from a whole host

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:10.860
of health conditions.

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:13.250
So I was not giving these people
any medical treatment.

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:15.210
They had already gotten
the best medical

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:16.530
treatment out there.

00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:19.600
And they were getting better,
and I couldn't explain that.

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:23.250
That didn't make any sense
to my very logical, very

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:24.850
scientific, very

00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:27.660
academically-educated doctor brain.

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:29.040
It's like, does not compute.

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:33.120
I really couldn't explain
what was going on.

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:36.580
So I started researching
spontaneous remissions.

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:39.850
This is a term the doctors use
to explain patients that get

00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:44.300
better either with no medical
treatment or with medical

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:47.000
treatment deemed to be
inadequate for cure.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.510
So I started looking into this,
and I came across a

00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:53.120
database called the Spontaneous
Remission Project.

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:56.730
And this is a database of over
3,500 case studies in the

00:07:56.730 --> 00:07:59.130
medical literature put together
by the Institute of

00:07:59.130 --> 00:08:00.460
Noetic Sciences.

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:02.680
And they're case studies that
doctors have written up as

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:05.960
kind of medical mysteries, of
people that had everything

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:09.530
from stage IV cancers
that disappeared.

00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:11.200
There was an HIV
positive person

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:12.970
who became HIV negative.

00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:16.150
There's a gunshot wound to
the head left untreated.

00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:17.950
And it wasn't just
life-threatening illnesses

00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:19.890
like heart failure and
kidney failure.

00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:24.150
It was ordinary things, like
thyroid disease or autoimmune

00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:27.640
disorders or diabetes or
high blood pressure.

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:29.910
So I was reading through these
case studies and this didn't

00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:30.820
make any sense to me.

00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:33.490
Again, doctor brain
does not compute.

00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:36.650
Because I was not only a very
skeptical physician, but I was

00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:38.750
a very skeptical patient.

00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:41.840
So by the time I was 33 years
old, I had been diagnosed with

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:43.734
a whole host of chronic
health conditions.

00:08:43.734 --> 00:08:46.160
And I was taking seven
medications that my doctors

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:48.660
had told me I'd have to take
for the rest of my life.

00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:51.920
So being a doctor, and being
raised by a doctor, I believed

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:52.630
my doctors.

00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:55.500
And I believed that these were
chronic conditions that I

00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:57.750
would have for the
rest of my life.

00:08:57.750 --> 00:09:01.060
So when I started reading these
cases of spontaneous

00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:03.480
remission, it was like
this light bulb

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:04.910
going off in my mind.

00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:06.340
Like, wait a minute.

00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:09.430
Every single health condition
that I was dealing with

00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:13.890
myself, I was able to find a
case study of somebody who had

00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:17.280
that condition and got better
without medical treatment.

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:21.460
And it was like a switch flipped
in my brain, where all

00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:23.810
of a sudden I started thinking,
what if my illnesses

00:09:23.810 --> 00:09:25.260
aren't chronic?

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:26.610
What if they're not incurable?

00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:30.280
What if it's possible that I
might not have to take seven

00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:33.000
medications for the
rest of my life?

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.760
And it was really-- have you
guys heard the story of the

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:37.740
four-minute mile?

00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:39.310
Yeah, I see you guys nodding.

00:09:39.310 --> 00:09:42.290
So exercise physiologists once
believed that it was

00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:45.010
impossible, humanly,
physiologically impossible,

00:09:45.010 --> 00:09:46.705
for a human being
to run a mile in

00:09:46.705 --> 00:09:47.780
less than four minutes.

00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:48.880
And nobody had ever done it.

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:52.270
It was kind of this world-wide
belief in the athletic

00:09:52.270 --> 00:09:54.830
community that this
was impossible.

00:09:54.830 --> 00:09:57.730
And then Roger Bannister
ran the mile in 3

00:09:57.730 --> 00:09:59.770
minutes and 59 seconds.

00:09:59.770 --> 00:10:03.400
And now almost every world-class
runner has run a

00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:04.970
sub-four-minute mile.

00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:08.520
So it was like that belief
that it was impossible

00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:11.170
suddenly shifted everything for
the world of athletics.

00:10:11.170 --> 00:10:13.980
And reading the Spontaneous
Remission Project and then

00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:16.090
going through even more case
studies in the medical

00:10:16.090 --> 00:10:18.040
literature was like
that for me.

00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:20.750
It was like all of a sudden
everything shifted, and I

00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:23.980
suddenly started thinking, what
if it's possible that I

00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:25.310
could have a spontaneous
remission?

00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:26.790
What if it's possible
that you could have

00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:28.310
a spontaneous remission?

00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:31.730
And I was watching my patients
do this by asking the

00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:34.290
question, what does my body
need in order to heal, and

00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:36.080
then getting really brave.

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:39.690
So one of the case studies
that I came across was

00:10:39.690 --> 00:10:43.110
recently in "The New
York Times," this

00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:44.890
guy Stamatis Moraitis.

00:10:44.890 --> 00:10:47.715
So Stamatis Moraitis was a Greek
war veteran who came to

00:10:47.715 --> 00:10:51.330
the United States in the 1940s
with a combat-mangled arm.

00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:52.620
So they fixed his arm.

00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:56.530
He wound up getting a job in
manual labor, and he married a

00:10:56.530 --> 00:10:59.160
Greek-American woman, settled
down, had kids.

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:01.120
And one day Stamatis was at work
and he was getting really

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:01.750
short of breath.

00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:03.900
So he goes to see the doctor,
and the doctor tells him, you

00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:06.230
have terminal lung cancer.

00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:09.380
And basically tells him he's
got nine months to live.

00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:11.780
So they offered him aggressive
treatment, but they said it's

00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:14.750
really not going to extend your
life very much, and the

00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:16.110
side effects are going
to be rough.

00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:20.080
So Stamatis decided, well, if I
only have nine months left,

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:22.310
I'd rather skip the treatment.

00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:24.410
And I might as well
save some money.

00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:25.550
I don't have a whole
lot of money.

00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:27.650
I might as well save the
money for my wife.

00:11:27.650 --> 00:11:30.080
So he and his wife decided to
move back to his native

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:34.290
Ikaria, a small island
in Greece.

00:11:34.290 --> 00:11:38.300
He figured he might as well be
buried in the graveyard with

00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:41.750
his ancestors, overlooking
the Aegean Sea.

00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:44.530
So they moved back to Ikaria,
and they move in with

00:11:44.530 --> 00:11:46.150
Stamatis' parents.

00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:48.890
And word gets out.

00:11:48.890 --> 00:11:50.440
Friends hear that he's back.

00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:52.780
And they start coming and
bringing bottles of wine and

00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:53.960
board games to play.

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:55.680
He figures, hey, I'm dying
in nine months, I

00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:57.960
might as well die happy.

00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:00.140
So this goes on.

00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:03.300
He decides he's going
to plant a garden.

00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:05.040
He doesn't really expect that
he's going to be around to

00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:06.950
harvest it, but he thought it
would be lovely for his wife

00:12:06.950 --> 00:12:08.295
to be able to pick
some vegetables

00:12:08.295 --> 00:12:10.020
and think about him.

00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:12.100
And he starts going back
to the old church

00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:13.680
that he grew up in--

00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:15.530
reconnected with his faith
and with the people

00:12:15.530 --> 00:12:17.470
that he grew up with.

00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:20.410
So one thing leads to another
and actually the vegetables

00:12:20.410 --> 00:12:21.130
come to harvest.

00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:23.350
And he's feeling well enough to
harvest the vegetables, so

00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:26.640
he decides he's going to start
tending the untended vineyards

00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:28.040
on his parents' property.

00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:30.320
And he winds up making
some wine.

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:34.570
Well, long story short, that was
45 years ago, and Stamatis

00:12:34.570 --> 00:12:37.230
Moraitis turned 98
years old on New

00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:39.380
Year's Day of this year.

00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:43.040
So 25 years after his initial
diagnosis, he decides he's

00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:45.660
going to go back to the United
States and track down his

00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:48.000
doctors to find out
what happened.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.250
And apparently, they
were all dead.

00:12:52.250 --> 00:12:56.640
So stories like this made me
really start to question,

00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:58.210
what's going on here?

00:12:58.210 --> 00:13:02.840
And the question that kept
coming into my mind was, can

00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:04.590
the mind really heal the body?

00:13:04.590 --> 00:13:07.910
You hear about it, sort of
this new age folklore.

00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:10.830
And I had read some books about
mind-body medicine, and

00:13:10.830 --> 00:13:14.040
none of them seemed very
well-substantiated from a

00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:16.390
scientific perspective.

00:13:16.390 --> 00:13:17.450
So I was curious.

00:13:17.450 --> 00:13:18.330
I was intrigued.

00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:21.250
I mean, it's a nice idea.

00:13:21.250 --> 00:13:26.360
But, again, my skeptical brain
sort of thinking, that sounds

00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:30.160
like, at best, wishful thinking,
and at worst, just

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:34.210
good old fashioned snake
oil selling quackery.

00:13:34.210 --> 00:13:36.110
But then I started investigating
further.

00:13:36.110 --> 00:13:39.330
Is there any evidence that the
mind can heal the body?

00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:41.760
And that's when I realized that
the medical establishment

00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:44.200
has been proving that the
mind can heal the

00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:46.140
body for over 50 years.

00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:48.350
We call it the placebo effect.

00:13:48.350 --> 00:13:48.530
Right?

00:13:48.530 --> 00:13:50.320
You guys have all heard
of the placebo effect.

00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:52.570
It's this thing we kind of
brush under the carpet in

00:13:52.570 --> 00:13:53.590
Western medicine.

00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:54.840
We know it's there.

00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:57.380
We know that in clinical trials,
when you give people a

00:13:57.380 --> 00:14:00.480
sugar pill or a saline
injection or, most

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:04.830
effectively, a fake surgery, 18%
to 80% of them get better.

00:14:04.830 --> 00:14:07.740
So they know they might be
getting either the real

00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:12.180
treatment or this fake
treatment, but they don't know

00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:14.720
which they're getting and
neither does their doctor.

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:19.410
So on average it's about 30% to
35% of people get better.

00:14:19.410 --> 00:14:24.000
And certainly, as a doctor, I
know about the placebo effect.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.100
It's out there.

00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:25.910
We're sort of taught about it.

00:14:25.910 --> 00:14:27.500
But nobody really explains it.

00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:31.310
What's happening when 30% to 35%
of people get better from

00:14:31.310 --> 00:14:33.090
getting a sugar pill?

00:14:33.090 --> 00:14:35.610
So I started investigating
the placebo effect.

00:14:35.610 --> 00:14:37.660
I thought, is it just
in their minds?

00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:39.310
Are they just feeling better?

00:14:39.310 --> 00:14:41.700
But no, it's physiologically
measurable.

00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:43.790
These people in these
clinical trials,

00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:45.760
their bronchi are dilating.

00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:47.860
Their warts are disappearing.

00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:49.860
Their colons are becoming
less inflamed.

00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:51.510
There's measurable
physiological

00:14:51.510 --> 00:14:52.780
things that are happening.

00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:56.000
Bald guys getting sugar pills
in the Rogaine studies

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:57.950
actually grew hair.

00:14:57.950 --> 00:14:59.730
So it's not just
in their minds.

00:14:59.730 --> 00:15:02.410
It's something physiological
happening in the body.

00:15:02.410 --> 00:15:05.680
So it sort of led me down this
rabbit hole of my own

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:08.680
research, of one question
after another.

00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:12.170
I found that the mind can not
only heal the body, the mind

00:15:12.170 --> 00:15:13.340
can harm the body.

00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:16.900
There's something called the
nocebo effect, which is the

00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:19.010
evil twin of the
placebo effect.

00:15:19.010 --> 00:15:22.230
Those same clinical trials where
18% to 80% of people get

00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:25.290
better from taking a sugar pill,
we also have to warn

00:15:25.290 --> 00:15:27.800
those people when they're in
those studies of the side

00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:29.940
effects that they might get if
they're getting a real drug.

00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:30.720
Right?

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:32.200
So we tell them, here's
the side effects.

00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:37.010
Well, an equally high percentage
of people actually

00:15:37.010 --> 00:15:39.300
get those side effects when
they're not getting the drug.

00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:41.030
They're getting the
sugar pill.

00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:44.320
So thinking that we might
actually be at risk of these

00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:47.420
side effects actually makes
people get these side effects.

00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:50.940
And there's much more dramatic
instances of things like that.

00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:53.730
There's case studies all over
the medical literature of

00:15:53.730 --> 00:15:56.500
people that were told that
they were going to die in

00:15:56.500 --> 00:16:00.010
three months, for example, of
a cancer diagnosis, and then

00:16:00.010 --> 00:16:02.920
they die almost exactly three
months to the date, and on

00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:05.780
autopsy, it turns out they
don't have cancer.

00:16:05.780 --> 00:16:08.640
So there's all kinds of studies
out there showing that

00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:10.510
when we have negative beliefs
about our health--

00:16:10.510 --> 00:16:11.340
and many of us do.

00:16:11.340 --> 00:16:13.510
Many of us are programmed with
negative beliefs about our

00:16:13.510 --> 00:16:15.270
health from an early age.

00:16:15.270 --> 00:16:18.990
We have those, oh, breast cancer
runs in my family,

00:16:18.990 --> 00:16:21.880
therefore, I'm at risk of
breast cancer, thoughts.

00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:24.680
Or we have, I'm always going
to be battling my weight

00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:27.590
because my parents always
battled their weight.

00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:31.450
Or even just something simple,
like I can't heal myself.

00:16:31.450 --> 00:16:35.620
I'm dependent on doctors
to heal me.

00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:37.920
So I actually, when I was doing
this research, I have a

00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:41.020
seven year old, and at the time,
my daughter was four.

00:16:41.020 --> 00:16:43.450
And I was reading all the data
showing that basically, our

00:16:43.450 --> 00:16:45.520
subconscious minds get
programmed by the time we're

00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:49.200
about six, and that 90% to 95%
of the time, we're operating

00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:51.730
from these beliefs of our
subconscious mind that are

00:16:51.730 --> 00:16:54.380
often programmed into us
by the time we're six.

00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:57.080
So I was noticing my husband,
when my daughter would get

00:16:57.080 --> 00:17:00.700
injured or when she'd get a cold
or something, he'd start

00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:01.820
pretending he's an ambulance.

00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:04.460
And he's going around
going [SIREN NOISE]

00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:06.670
we've got to take an Sienna
to the kid factory.

00:17:06.670 --> 00:17:08.069
We've got to get
her a new knee.

00:17:08.069 --> 00:17:11.140
Or, we've got to get her a
new throat, or whatever.

00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:13.920
And I told my husband, we've
got to stop doing that.

00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:16.250
Because we're programming our
child to think that the

00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:19.190
solution is at the
kid factory.

00:17:19.190 --> 00:17:22.040
That she needs to go, and that
it's outside of her, this

00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:23.800
ability to get well.

00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:26.573
So we started reprogramming,
and we started telling her,

00:17:26.573 --> 00:17:29.000
you know what, we're going to
put this Band-Aid on your knee

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.390
so that you'll feel better while
your body heals itself.

00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:34.850
And I'm going to give you this
cough syrup so that you're

00:17:34.850 --> 00:17:37.600
going to feel a little better
while your body heals itself

00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:38.730
from this cold.

00:17:38.730 --> 00:17:40.130
And now she's great.

00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:41.800
I mean, she's so programmed.

00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:44.340
So people talk about being sick,
and she's like, it's OK,

00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:47.980
your body knows how
to heal itself.

00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:50.780
So I was reading about all of
this and I'm researching all

00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:54.840
of this, and I'm slowly getting
kind of accustomed to

00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:57.790
the idea of like, oh, maybe the
mind can heal the body.

00:17:57.790 --> 00:18:00.090
There's so much research, and
it's all included in my book

00:18:00.090 --> 00:18:01.020
"Mind Over Medicine--

00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:03.690
Scientific Proof That You Can
Heal Yourself." So I was

00:18:03.690 --> 00:18:07.170
chronicling all of this as I
was going, but my skeptic

00:18:07.170 --> 00:18:09.920
brain really needed
an explanation.

00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:11.760
What's happening here?

00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:12.980
How do we explain this?

00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:15.140
I needed a physiologic
explanation.

00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:16.060
It's not magic.

00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:18.580
It can't be magic, right?

00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:24.120
So I started researching what
explanations are out there of

00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:26.500
how the placebo effect works.

00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:30.640
And what I found is that
researchers believe that some

00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:34.800
combination of the positive
belief that they're going to

00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:36.810
get well-- people are in this
clinical trial, they're going

00:18:36.810 --> 00:18:38.960
to get the new wonder
drug or the new

00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:40.780
fancy surgery or whatever.

00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:43.890
So they believe that they're
getting the real treatment,

00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:46.540
and so they believe the real
treatment's going to work.

00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:49.720
So it's that combination of
positive belief and then

00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:52.530
there's also this element of the
nurturing care of somebody

00:18:52.530 --> 00:18:54.890
in a white coat saying,
I believe this is

00:18:54.890 --> 00:18:55.900
going to help you.

00:18:55.900 --> 00:18:57.900
And we put a lot of
meaning in that.

00:18:57.900 --> 00:19:00.440
We're conditioned to believe
that if somebody in a white

00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:03.410
coat says, this is going to
help you, that it will.

00:19:03.410 --> 00:19:07.150
So researchers believe that that
combination of positive

00:19:07.150 --> 00:19:11.390
belief and the nurturing care
of a health care provider

00:19:11.390 --> 00:19:15.110
leads to changes in the brain
that are translated into the

00:19:15.110 --> 00:19:17.230
physiology of the body
through a whole

00:19:17.230 --> 00:19:20.040
cascade of hormonal changes.

00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:22.060
So let me explain
this for you.

00:19:22.060 --> 00:19:24.750
I'm going to give you a little
neuroanatomy lesson first.

00:19:24.750 --> 00:19:27.560
So there's this part of our
brain called the amygdala.

00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:29.800
And the amygdala is in
the limbic brain.

00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:34.610
So this is not your thinking,
rational, logical forebrain.

00:19:34.610 --> 00:19:37.950
It's the ancient lizard part
of your primordial brain.

00:19:37.950 --> 00:19:42.940
And the amygdala's primary
job is to keep on

00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:44.850
the alert for danger.

00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:47.205
So have you guys seen those
meerkats at the zoo, the

00:19:47.205 --> 00:19:48.670
little prairie dogs?

00:19:48.670 --> 00:19:49.390
I love them.

00:19:49.390 --> 00:19:51.880
They're always sitting there,
and there's always the meerkat

00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:55.460
sentry up on the mound, kind of
looking around to make sure

00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:57.370
that there's not a tiger
on the loose.

00:19:57.370 --> 00:19:59.750
And it's their job to signal
to the whole community if

00:19:59.750 --> 00:20:01.710
something's coming.

00:20:01.710 --> 00:20:04.360
So the amygdala, I like to think
of it as it's sort of

00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:07.170
like that meerkat, the sentry
up on the mound.

00:20:07.170 --> 00:20:10.720
It's always trying to protect
you, so it's always on the

00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:12.760
lookout for danger.

00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:14.740
And this is a good
thing, right?

00:20:14.740 --> 00:20:17.770
Because if there's a tiger on
the loose, then this is

00:20:17.770 --> 00:20:18.790
something that we need.

00:20:18.790 --> 00:20:22.130
Because what happens is if the
amygdala sees that there's a

00:20:22.130 --> 00:20:25.000
tiger on the loose, all of
a sudden the amygdala can

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:28.580
communicate with the
hypothalamus, which

00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:30.710
communicates with the pituitary
gland that talks to

00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:31.560
the adrenal gland.

00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:33.200
And all of a sudden the adrenal
gland is spitting out

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:35.020
cortisol and epinephrine.

00:20:35.020 --> 00:20:37.840
So you're now in the middle of
a fight or flight response.

00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:38.620
Right?

00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:40.130
So Walter Cannon at
Harvard called

00:20:40.130 --> 00:20:41.910
this the stress response.

00:20:41.910 --> 00:20:43.850
And it's there to protect you.

00:20:43.850 --> 00:20:46.460
It's so that when you're in
stress response and your life

00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:48.380
is in danger, your heart
rate goes up.

00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:49.800
Your blood pressure goes up.

00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:51.880
You get blood flow to the large
muscle groups so you can

00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:53.100
outrun the tiger.

00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:55.130
So this is here to protect
you, right?

00:20:55.130 --> 00:20:58.440
But the problem is the amygdala
is not smart.

00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:01.190
So it can't tell the difference
between there's a

00:21:01.190 --> 00:21:05.430
tiger on the loose and you're
about to get eaten or

00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:07.300
nobody loves me.

00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:11.340
Or my family has a history of
breast cancer and so I might

00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:13.090
get breast cancer.

00:21:13.090 --> 00:21:16.490
Or I hate my job.

00:21:16.490 --> 00:21:20.460
Or even something simple, like
somebody just spilled red wine

00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:22.070
on my white carpet.

00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:24.400
As far as your amygdala is
concerned, all of those are

00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:25.980
equal threats.

00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:28.940
So whenever you have a thought
like that, the amygdala starts

00:21:28.940 --> 00:21:31.980
this hormonal cascade and the
body is full of cortisol and

00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:33.440
epinephrine.

00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:37.320
Now fortunately, there's an
equal and opposite reaction

00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:40.400
called the relaxation response,
which is when the

00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:43.670
body is in the parasympathetic
nervous system.

00:21:43.670 --> 00:21:47.170
So the fight or flight is the
sympathetic nervous system.

00:21:47.170 --> 00:21:51.560
The parasympathetic nervous
system is the homeostatic

00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:53.660
state of the nervous system.

00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:58.020
So in the relaxation response,
all of those stress hormones

00:21:58.020 --> 00:22:01.230
go away and the body releases
healing hormones like

00:22:01.230 --> 00:22:05.770
oxytocin, dopamine, nitric
oxide, endorphins.

00:22:05.770 --> 00:22:08.630
These are all hormones that
help the body heal.

00:22:08.630 --> 00:22:13.030
So here's the one thing-- if you
get only one thing from my

00:22:13.030 --> 00:22:15.390
talk today, this is what
I want you to hear.

00:22:15.390 --> 00:22:18.870
The body is beautifully
equipped with natural

00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:20.070
self-repair mechanisms.

00:22:20.070 --> 00:22:20.570
We know this.

00:22:20.570 --> 00:22:21.960
They teach us this in
medical school.

00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:23.900
It's in our physiology
textbooks.

00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:26.250
So we know that we all make
cancer cells every day.

00:22:26.250 --> 00:22:27.440
We fight the cancer cells.

00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:29.220
Our body knows how to do that.

00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:31.610
We're all exposed to infectious
agents all the

00:22:31.610 --> 00:22:32.550
time, right?

00:22:32.550 --> 00:22:34.040
But we fight the infectious
agents.

00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:36.870
They don't make us sick
most of the time.

00:22:36.870 --> 00:22:38.380
We have broken proteins.

00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:40.600
The body knows how to fix
things like that.

00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:42.470
But here's what I didn't
know until I

00:22:42.470 --> 00:22:44.590
started doing this research.

00:22:44.590 --> 00:22:49.780
The body's natural self-repair
mechanisms only operate when

00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:52.770
the body is in relaxation
response.

00:22:52.770 --> 00:22:56.100
So any time your body's in
stress response, those

00:22:56.100 --> 00:22:58.780
mechanisms are disabled.

00:22:58.780 --> 00:23:02.620
So that was a huge realization
for me because we're only

00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:05.860
supposed to be in stress
response in emergencies.

00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:10.460
I was just driving to Munster,
Indiana, last week to go speak

00:23:10.460 --> 00:23:14.430
to a bunch of people at a cancer
center, and all of a

00:23:14.430 --> 00:23:17.700
sudden two tires on the left
side of the car blew out.

00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:20.350
And the car literally
almost tipped over.

00:23:20.350 --> 00:23:24.690
Just something in the road
got into the tires.

00:23:24.690 --> 00:23:26.930
And all of a sudden, I noticed
myself in that stress

00:23:26.930 --> 00:23:27.660
response, right?

00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:29.790
Because all of a sudden, I've
got to figure out how to--

00:23:29.790 --> 00:23:31.240
I'm going 65 on the highway.

00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:33.900
I've got to get this
car off, safely, to

00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:34.610
the shoulder, right?

00:23:34.610 --> 00:23:35.290
So this is good.

00:23:35.290 --> 00:23:36.770
My body is supposed
to be in a stress

00:23:36.770 --> 00:23:38.520
response during that time.

00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:40.570
So I'm wrangling the car.

00:23:40.570 --> 00:23:42.220
I've got cortisol
and epinephrine

00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:43.550
coursing through my veins.

00:23:43.550 --> 00:23:46.110
I managed to get the
car safely off to

00:23:46.110 --> 00:23:47.310
the side of the road.

00:23:47.310 --> 00:23:51.200
Now, if I were an animal, as
soon as I'm safe, my amygdala

00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:53.010
would say, you're safe now.

00:23:53.010 --> 00:23:55.110
And that stress hormone
would go down.

00:23:55.110 --> 00:23:57.250
The stress response
would stop.

00:23:57.250 --> 00:23:59.320
Because those stress responses
are only supposed to last

00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:02.110
about 90 seconds after
the threat is gone.

00:24:02.110 --> 00:24:03.710
But what starts happening?

00:24:03.710 --> 00:24:03.930
Right?

00:24:03.930 --> 00:24:08.100
My brain suddenly starts going,
like, oh no, I'm still

00:24:08.100 --> 00:24:10.000
far from where I'm speaking.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:12.790
And I suddenly now have
two flat tires.

00:24:12.790 --> 00:24:14.120
I'm going to miss my speech.

00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:16.180
I'm going to disappoint
the event planner.

00:24:16.180 --> 00:24:17.310
I can't even--

00:24:17.310 --> 00:24:18.920
where is my AAA card?

00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:19.970
My wallet was stolen.

00:24:19.970 --> 00:24:21.620
I don't have my AAA card.

00:24:21.620 --> 00:24:22.760
This isn't even my car.

00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:24.680
I'm driving my best
friend's car.

00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:25.800
These thoughts, right?

00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:28.930
We have these spiraling
stress responses.

00:24:28.930 --> 00:24:31.560
And I was really aware in the
moment of like, oh, this is

00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:32.890
how it happens, right?

00:24:32.890 --> 00:24:35.090
And this is how it happens
for most of us.

00:24:35.090 --> 00:24:39.580
So on average, we have about 50
stress responses per day.

00:24:39.580 --> 00:24:42.530
And people who hate their jobs
or they're in difficult

00:24:42.530 --> 00:24:45.630
relationships, they probably
have more like 100.

00:24:45.630 --> 00:24:48.830
And every time we have a stress
response, our body's

00:24:48.830 --> 00:24:53.030
natural self-healing capacities
are disabled.

00:24:53.030 --> 00:24:54.300
They don't work.

00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:57.850
So this is how the placebo
effect works.

00:24:57.850 --> 00:25:02.150
When we have that positive
belief that we're getting the

00:25:02.150 --> 00:25:06.450
wonder drug, and when it's
delivered to us by a nurturing

00:25:06.450 --> 00:25:10.800
health care provider, the
amygdala is calmed down.

00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:14.100
So before the person comes in to
the clinical trial, they're

00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:16.200
usually nervous and
scared, right?

00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:18.100
Their amygdala is firing.

00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:18.900
You've got an illness.

00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:20.270
Things aren't right.

00:25:20.270 --> 00:25:22.030
Things are at risk.

00:25:22.030 --> 00:25:23.510
The little meerkat's
out there.

00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:25.800
But that combination of positive
belief and the

00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:28.680
nurturing care of the right kind
of health care provider

00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:31.270
can calm the amygdala down.

00:25:31.270 --> 00:25:32.870
And all of a sudden,
the body's filled

00:25:32.870 --> 00:25:34.500
with the healing hormones.

00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:37.795
And voila, the body starts to
heal itself, even though all

00:25:37.795 --> 00:25:39.830
you're getting is
a sugar pill.

00:25:39.830 --> 00:25:43.170
So the next question that sort
of was coming into my brain

00:25:43.170 --> 00:25:46.250
was, well, we're not all in
clinical trials, right?

00:25:46.250 --> 00:25:48.860
Should we all be going around
popping sugar pills?

00:25:48.860 --> 00:25:51.610
Or is there some other way
that we can do that?

00:25:51.610 --> 00:25:55.510
That we can have that same sort
of placebo effect in a

00:25:55.510 --> 00:25:57.970
way that we can maybe control.

00:25:57.970 --> 00:25:59.960
So one of the things I was
researching, when I was

00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:02.060
looking at spontaneous
remissions and patients who

00:26:02.060 --> 00:26:05.900
had had these kind of medical
mysteries was, were these all

00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:07.370
just flukes?

00:26:07.370 --> 00:26:10.145
Was Stamatis Moraitis
just lucky?

00:26:10.145 --> 00:26:12.430
Or is there something that
these people were doing?

00:26:12.430 --> 00:26:14.840
Was there something proactive
that they were doing?

00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:18.710
And I came across the research
of Dr. Kelly Turner, who did

00:26:18.710 --> 00:26:20.730
her PhD thesis--

00:26:20.730 --> 00:26:22.890
she studied at Harvard
and UC Berkeley--

00:26:22.890 --> 00:26:25.490
and she did her thesis on people
who had had spontaneous

00:26:25.490 --> 00:26:27.590
remissions from stage
IV cancers.

00:26:27.590 --> 00:26:30.470
And she was interviewing these
patients, as well as the often

00:26:30.470 --> 00:26:33.210
alternative health care
providers that had facilitated

00:26:33.210 --> 00:26:34.450
their healing journeys.

00:26:34.450 --> 00:26:35.680
And she was trying to figure
out, was there

00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:36.950
something in common?

00:26:36.950 --> 00:26:39.510
Could she learn something
from these people

00:26:39.510 --> 00:26:41.910
about how to heal ourselves?

00:26:41.910 --> 00:26:45.340
And what she found is that there
were six behaviors that

00:26:45.340 --> 00:26:46.680
these people had in common.

00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:48.660
And only two of them were the
sort of things that a

00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:51.480
forward-thinking doctor
might have prescribed.

00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:55.930
One of them was changing your
diet to more vegetable-based,

00:26:55.930 --> 00:26:58.360
often gluten free
sort of diet.

00:26:58.360 --> 00:27:01.610
And the other was taking some
sort of supplement that the

00:27:01.610 --> 00:27:05.320
patient believed was really
going to help strengthen their

00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:07.370
immune system, help fight
off the cancer.

00:27:07.370 --> 00:27:10.180
The other four things, and
they're all listed in "Mind

00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:12.950
Over Medicine," the other four
things were all things that

00:27:12.950 --> 00:27:14.990
were happening here.

00:27:14.990 --> 00:27:19.630
They weren't medical
treatments per se.

00:27:19.630 --> 00:27:22.330
So that's when I started
getting really curious.

00:27:22.330 --> 00:27:26.850
Like what could we do to flip
on our body's natural

00:27:26.850 --> 00:27:30.040
self-repair mechanisms the way
people in clinical trials have

00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:33.200
them flipped on when they're
getting a placebo?

00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:36.400
So the whole second part of my
book is about the research

00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:39.950
that I found showing that in
order to be healthy, we need

00:27:39.950 --> 00:27:45.530
more than just a healthy diet,
a healthy exercise regimen,

00:27:45.530 --> 00:27:48.440
getting enough sleep, taking
your vitamins, getting your

00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:50.060
pap smears, or whatever.

00:27:50.060 --> 00:27:50.370
Right?

00:27:50.370 --> 00:27:53.650
We need healthy relationships.

00:27:53.650 --> 00:27:57.230
We need healthy professional
lives.

00:27:57.230 --> 00:27:58.690
We need a healthy
spiritual life.

00:27:58.690 --> 00:27:59.960
A healthy creative life.

00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:01.700
A healthy sex life.

00:28:01.700 --> 00:28:04.040
We need a healthy relationship
with our money.

00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:07.270
We need to live and work in
healthy environments.

00:28:07.270 --> 00:28:10.310
We need to have healthy minds.

00:28:10.310 --> 00:28:13.440
And this is why my patients
in Marin were sick.

00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:13.820
Right?

00:28:13.820 --> 00:28:15.950
I mean, I love kale.

00:28:15.950 --> 00:28:19.540
I drink my green juice, five
green juices a day.

00:28:19.540 --> 00:28:21.800
I'm a big fan of
a healthy diet.

00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:25.460
But the reality is that no
amount of kale can counter

00:28:25.460 --> 00:28:29.050
balance the poisonous effects
of chronic repetitive stress

00:28:29.050 --> 00:28:32.590
responses in the body and all
that cortisol and epinephrine,

00:28:32.590 --> 00:28:35.420
which not only turns off the
body's self-repair mechanisms,

00:28:35.420 --> 00:28:37.210
it also poisons the heart.

00:28:37.210 --> 00:28:40.810
It has all kinds of other
negative effects on the body.

00:28:40.810 --> 00:28:44.800
So I wanted to try to figure
out, how can I help people

00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:47.160
activate those natural
self-repair mechanisms?

00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:49.380
How can we have the benefit of
the placebo effect without

00:28:49.380 --> 00:28:50.885
having to take a sugar pill?

00:28:50.885 --> 00:28:53.340
So I came up with a new wellness
model that I teach in

00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:56.070
"Mind Over Medicine."
It's based on

00:28:56.070 --> 00:28:57.510
something called a cairn.

00:28:57.510 --> 00:28:58.890
Have you guys seen these?

00:28:58.890 --> 00:29:00.220
I love cairns.

00:29:00.220 --> 00:29:02.430
And they're all over
San Francisco.

00:29:02.430 --> 00:29:06.190
When you're at the marina,
they're stacked along the

00:29:06.190 --> 00:29:06.760
water there.

00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:10.060
And it's amazing because they're
so simultaneously

00:29:10.060 --> 00:29:11.790
strong and fragile, right?

00:29:11.790 --> 00:29:15.070
I mean, they can withstand waves
crashing upon them, and

00:29:15.070 --> 00:29:17.100
yet you get one of those stones
out of balance and the

00:29:17.100 --> 00:29:19.500
whole thing falls apart.

00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:22.560
So I created a wellness
model based on this.

00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:24.880
I call it the whole
health cairn.

00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:28.500
And it's based on all of the
data that shows that every

00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:33.300
single one of these facets of
your health is scientifically

00:29:33.300 --> 00:29:36.830
proven to affect the health
of your body.

00:29:36.830 --> 00:29:43.050
So for example, people with
strong sense of community,

00:29:43.050 --> 00:29:46.720
they have half the rate of heart
disease as people who

00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:47.940
are lonely.

00:29:47.940 --> 00:29:51.120
And there's tons of research
looking at relationships and

00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:53.300
health, and there's a whole
chapter in "Mind Over

00:29:53.300 --> 00:29:55.610
Medicine" about that,
about the effects of

00:29:55.610 --> 00:29:57.270
loneliness on health.

00:29:57.270 --> 00:30:00.420
So researchers concluded, after
looking at all of this

00:30:00.420 --> 00:30:05.410
data, that alleviating your
loneliness is more important

00:30:05.410 --> 00:30:08.310
for the health of your body
than starting an exercise

00:30:08.310 --> 00:30:10.220
program or quitting smoking.

00:30:10.220 --> 00:30:13.490
But when was the last time your
doctor put a prescription

00:30:13.490 --> 00:30:16.540
that said alleviate
your loneliness?

00:30:16.540 --> 00:30:21.780
Work stress is another huge
thing that can trigger our

00:30:21.780 --> 00:30:24.820
stress responses and disable
our natural self-repair

00:30:24.820 --> 00:30:25.750
mechanisms.

00:30:25.750 --> 00:30:29.085
In Japan, they even have a word
for death by overwork.

00:30:29.085 --> 00:30:32.060
It's called "karoshi." And
I include in "Mind Over

00:30:32.060 --> 00:30:37.400
Medicine" all of the data
showing how much work stress

00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:40.040
affects our physical bodies.

00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:41.770
Financial stress, same thing.

00:30:41.770 --> 00:30:45.020
So many people in this country
worried about money and the

00:30:45.020 --> 00:30:47.060
amygdala cannot tell the
difference between, oh my

00:30:47.060 --> 00:30:49.130
goodness, how am I going to pay
my bills, and there's a

00:30:49.130 --> 00:30:50.750
tiger on the loose.

00:30:50.750 --> 00:30:53.750
So what I realized is that
every stone in this whole

00:30:53.750 --> 00:30:57.930
health cairn can either trigger
stress responses or it

00:30:57.930 --> 00:31:00.300
can trigger relaxation
responses.

00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:00.580
Right?

00:31:00.580 --> 00:31:03.810
So if you're in a loving,
nurturing relationship, then

00:31:03.810 --> 00:31:07.490
that's going to fill your body
with oxytocin, dopamine,

00:31:07.490 --> 00:31:10.170
nitric oxide, endorphins,
these healing hormones,

00:31:10.170 --> 00:31:12.770
because the amygdala
is calmed down.

00:31:12.770 --> 00:31:15.900
Whereas if you're in a stressful
relationship, things

00:31:15.900 --> 00:31:18.650
aren't going well, you're going
to be triggering stress

00:31:18.650 --> 00:31:20.710
responses all the time.

00:31:20.710 --> 00:31:23.500
So each one of these stones in
the whole health cairn is

00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:26.600
essential to the health
of our bodies.

00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:31.980
So it led me to go back to my
patients and help them look at

00:31:31.980 --> 00:31:33.370
their lives.

00:31:33.370 --> 00:31:35.620
And I started teaching my
patients what I call the six

00:31:35.620 --> 00:31:36.940
steps to healing yourself.

00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:40.210
And these are all step by step
listed out in "Mind Over

00:31:40.210 --> 00:31:41.180
Medicine."

00:31:41.180 --> 00:31:44.900
But based on what I learned,
essentially--

00:31:44.900 --> 00:31:47.000
this is the six steps.

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:50.880
Number one is you have to
believe that it's possible.

00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:54.880
It was huge for me when I
realized that my illnesses

00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:57.860
were are all illnesses that at
least somebody had had a

00:31:57.860 --> 00:31:59.570
spontaneous remission from.

00:31:59.570 --> 00:32:02.790
And I'm now down to half the
dose of one of my seven

00:32:02.790 --> 00:32:06.890
medications, having done this
six step process for myself.

00:32:06.890 --> 00:32:09.580
But it all had to start with
me shifting my belief.

00:32:09.580 --> 00:32:12.370
I had to believe that these
weren't chronic, incurable

00:32:12.370 --> 00:32:14.560
illnesses, but that I
could get better.

00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:17.260
And you all have to do the same
if there's any health

00:32:17.260 --> 00:32:19.530
conditions you're dealing with,
and I'm not even talking

00:32:19.530 --> 00:32:22.490
about necessarily a diagnosis.

00:32:22.490 --> 00:32:25.770
For so many people there's
this epidemic of just not

00:32:25.770 --> 00:32:28.800
really being sick but
not being vital.

00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:31.090
We've sort of settled
for being well.

00:32:31.090 --> 00:32:32.180
And I know.

00:32:32.180 --> 00:32:33.980
So many of my patients in
Marin were like this.

00:32:33.980 --> 00:32:37.230
They'd come in and they
just feel tired.

00:32:37.230 --> 00:32:42.910
They're having body aches or
headaches or backaches.

00:32:42.910 --> 00:32:44.796
They've lost their libido.

00:32:44.796 --> 00:32:46.440
They're just not feeling--

00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:48.320
their mood is kind
of in the toilet.

00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:50.660
They're not feeling vital.

00:32:50.660 --> 00:32:53.650
So I started thinking of health
on sort of a spectrum.

00:32:53.650 --> 00:32:54.970
There's, like, sick
people, right?

00:32:54.970 --> 00:32:56.400
Where they have a diagnosis.

00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:57.690
They have abnormal
laboratory tests.

00:32:57.690 --> 00:33:00.320
They have abnormal
vital signs.

00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:02.120
And then there's well
people, who--

00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:06.530
in the medical establishment,
these are the people who have

00:33:06.530 --> 00:33:07.760
normal blood tests.

00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:09.520
They have normal vital signs.

00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:11.270
But they still don't necessarily
feel great.

00:33:11.270 --> 00:33:13.520
So these people are often very
frustrated because they come

00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:16.480
to doctors thinking that we're
going to have the solution,

00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:18.430
and we fail them very often.

00:33:18.430 --> 00:33:21.070
Because what they want to be
is they want to be vital.

00:33:21.070 --> 00:33:24.440
They want to feel just electric
with energy, like

00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:26.860
overflowing with life force.

00:33:26.860 --> 00:33:30.830
And what I realized is this is
how we become overflowing with

00:33:30.830 --> 00:33:31.860
life force.

00:33:31.860 --> 00:33:33.780
We go through this process.

00:33:33.780 --> 00:33:36.690
So step one is believe that it's
possible that you could

00:33:36.690 --> 00:33:38.790
get well, that you
could be vital.

00:33:38.790 --> 00:33:41.500
Step two is finding
the right support.

00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:44.800
So what I found in the
scientific data is that it's

00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:47.330
sort of a misnomer to say that
you can heal yourself, because

00:33:47.330 --> 00:33:51.300
the reality is the body can heal
itself, but the body more

00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:55.290
effectively heals itself with
the support of someone else

00:33:55.290 --> 00:33:57.190
who believes that you
can heal yourself,

00:33:57.190 --> 00:33:58.830
with the right healer.

00:33:58.830 --> 00:34:01.430
I'm now training doctors and
other health care providers at

00:34:01.430 --> 00:34:03.650
the Whole Health Medicine
Institute how to be

00:34:03.650 --> 00:34:04.940
that kind of healer.

00:34:04.940 --> 00:34:08.940
Because doctors can be both the
placebo effect, you know.

00:34:08.940 --> 00:34:12.929
They can be that nurturing care
that calms the amygdala.

00:34:12.929 --> 00:34:14.630
That doctor that says, you're
not going to go

00:34:14.630 --> 00:34:15.739
through this alone.

00:34:15.739 --> 00:34:17.090
I believe in you.

00:34:17.090 --> 00:34:19.690
I know that you can get through
this, and we're going

00:34:19.690 --> 00:34:20.989
to do it together.

00:34:20.989 --> 00:34:22.719
That is very calming
to the amygdala.

00:34:22.719 --> 00:34:26.159
The body's natural self-repair
mechanisms are more likely to

00:34:26.159 --> 00:34:27.960
be optimized in that
situation.

00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:29.630
But the opposite is also true.

00:34:29.630 --> 00:34:31.810
The doctor can be the nocebo.

00:34:31.810 --> 00:34:34.800
So my mom recently, she had a
sore neck and she went to see

00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:35.590
the doctor.

00:34:35.590 --> 00:34:38.690
And the doctor did an x-ray and
found an abnormality on

00:34:38.690 --> 00:34:40.590
the x-ray and ordered an MRI.

00:34:40.590 --> 00:34:41.609
And my mom asked why?

00:34:41.609 --> 00:34:42.520
Why the MRI?

00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:43.650
And he said, well, because it's

00:34:43.650 --> 00:34:45.750
probably metastatic cancer.

00:34:45.750 --> 00:34:47.540
And he turned around and walked
out of the room without

00:34:47.540 --> 00:34:49.600
a single comforting word.

00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:53.340
And you can imagine my mother,
who is a big fan of my work

00:34:53.340 --> 00:34:55.520
and has read "Mind Over
Medicine" and practices this

00:34:55.520 --> 00:34:56.415
in her own life.

00:34:56.415 --> 00:34:58.800
My phone rings, and
my mom says, my

00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:01.790
amygdala is freaking out.

00:35:01.790 --> 00:35:07.130
Because her doctor just said the
C-bomb without any other

00:35:07.130 --> 00:35:08.040
explanation.

00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:12.260
That is exactly what the
body doesn't need.

00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:14.600
If she had metastatic cancer,
he did the worst thing a

00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:19.030
doctor could do, because he
triggered her amygdala rather

00:35:19.030 --> 00:35:21.540
than being a calming
influence.

00:35:21.540 --> 00:35:26.260
So my mother, being smart about
this, she said, I need

00:35:26.260 --> 00:35:28.530
to look at my whole health cairn
right now, and I need

00:35:28.530 --> 00:35:29.920
your help walking me
through how am I

00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:31.170
going through the week.

00:35:31.170 --> 00:35:33.400
Because if I do have metastatic
cancer, I want to

00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:35.630
make sure my body's natural
self-repair mechanisms are

00:35:35.630 --> 00:35:38.060
totally optimized, right?

00:35:38.060 --> 00:35:41.360
So my mom and I walked through
all of these stones in her

00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:42.480
whole health cairn.

00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:46.460
How can we activate relaxation
responses in your body?

00:35:46.460 --> 00:35:49.790
And how can we make sure to
reduce any stress responses in

00:35:49.790 --> 00:35:51.340
your body this week?

00:35:51.340 --> 00:35:54.620
And my mother wrote what I call
writing the prescription.

00:35:54.620 --> 00:35:57.380
And she included all of these
things that she was going to

00:35:57.380 --> 00:36:00.580
plan to do that week, and she
was religious about it.

00:36:00.580 --> 00:36:05.440
Well, fortunately, my mom went
in to get her MRI and it

00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:07.760
turned out to be a
Schmorl's node.

00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:11.400
It's this benign lesion that
doesn't need any further

00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:12.970
treatment or follow up.

00:36:12.970 --> 00:36:16.240
But I told my mom, this was a
huge a-ha to me, because I

00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:18.590
realized we shouldn't
have to wait for a

00:36:18.590 --> 00:36:20.500
metastatic cancer diagnosis.

00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:23.105
Everything that she put on that
list, I said, mom, you

00:36:23.105 --> 00:36:24.940
need to be doing
this every day.

00:36:24.940 --> 00:36:25.170
Right?

00:36:25.170 --> 00:36:27.480
This is how you live to be 98
years old, like Stamatis

00:36:27.480 --> 00:36:31.500
Moraitis, who is still healthy
and vital to this day.

00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:35.910
We can live to be 98 by figuring
out how do we reduce

00:36:35.910 --> 00:36:37.640
stress responses
in our bodies?

00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:41.640
How do we increase relaxation
responses in our bodies?

00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:46.140
So step three is all about
listening to your intuition,

00:36:46.140 --> 00:36:48.570
to that part of you I call your
inner pilot light, which

00:36:48.570 --> 00:36:51.040
is the foundation stone of
the whole health cairn.

00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:52.540
This is your inner doctor.

00:36:52.540 --> 00:36:55.990
This is the part of you that
knows better than anybody how

00:36:55.990 --> 00:36:58.850
your body is going
to heal itself.

00:36:58.850 --> 00:37:02.040
So as doctors, we like to think
that I know your body

00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:03.946
better than you do.

00:37:03.946 --> 00:37:07.230
Ostensibly, I went to school
for 12 years and spent 10

00:37:07.230 --> 00:37:11.010
years of medical practice
becoming a body expert.

00:37:11.010 --> 00:37:14.680
But the reality is you know your
body better than anybody,

00:37:14.680 --> 00:37:18.490
because nobody but you knows how
you're going to be able to

00:37:18.490 --> 00:37:20.900
balance your whole health
cairn in this way.

00:37:20.900 --> 00:37:24.610
So my agent, my literary agent
Michele Martin, she was the

00:37:24.610 --> 00:37:25.720
first person to read my book.

00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:27.720
And she called me after reading
it and she said,

00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:29.380
Lissa, you changed my life.

00:37:29.380 --> 00:37:32.010
Because she said, honestly,
before I read your book, I

00:37:32.010 --> 00:37:34.190
thought my body was none
of my business.

00:37:34.190 --> 00:37:35.985
She said, I thought it
was like my car.

00:37:35.985 --> 00:37:37.390
You know, my car breaks
down, I take

00:37:37.390 --> 00:37:38.290
it to the auto mechanic.

00:37:38.290 --> 00:37:40.860
I expect the auto mechanic to
fix it and hand it back to me

00:37:40.860 --> 00:37:42.100
perfectly fixed.

00:37:42.100 --> 00:37:44.550
She said, I was doing the
same thing with my body.

00:37:44.550 --> 00:37:46.760
She said, but after reading your
book, I realize my body

00:37:46.760 --> 00:37:50.010
is my business, because I am the
gatekeeper of my mind and

00:37:50.010 --> 00:37:54.790
it is my responsibility to calm
my amygdala and optimize

00:37:54.790 --> 00:37:57.980
my body's natural self-healing
mechanisms.

00:37:57.980 --> 00:38:03.130
And that step three part of
listening to your intuition is

00:38:03.130 --> 00:38:04.010
all about that.

00:38:04.010 --> 00:38:07.050
It's about listening to that
voice that knows the answer to

00:38:07.050 --> 00:38:10.520
the question, what does my body
need in order to heal?

00:38:10.520 --> 00:38:14.240
So step four is all about
diagnosing the underlying root

00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:16.060
causes of illness.

00:38:16.060 --> 00:38:18.330
It's figuring out what is
triggering your stress

00:38:18.330 --> 00:38:22.790
responses and which ways might
you activate relaxation

00:38:22.790 --> 00:38:25.360
responses that you're
not optimizing.

00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:28.230
So in the book, there's a whole
series of questions that

00:38:28.230 --> 00:38:30.370
were some of the questions that
I asked on my patient

00:38:30.370 --> 00:38:32.950
intake form that are really
intended to help people

00:38:32.950 --> 00:38:35.560
identify what might be
out of balance in my

00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:36.820
whole health cairn.

00:38:36.820 --> 00:38:39.610
Which stone is toppling here?

00:38:39.610 --> 00:38:43.280
Which stone isn't at peak
performance right now?

00:38:43.280 --> 00:38:45.710
And how can I reduce those
stress responses and increase

00:38:45.710 --> 00:38:48.790
those relaxation responses in
my body so that my body's

00:38:48.790 --> 00:38:52.610
natural self-repair mechanisms
are fully functional?

00:38:52.610 --> 00:38:56.480
And step five is basically, once
you've done that, it's

00:38:56.480 --> 00:38:58.750
writing the prescription
for yourself.

00:38:58.750 --> 00:39:01.020
So it's answering the question,
what does my body

00:39:01.020 --> 00:39:05.120
need in order to heal, and
putting into place all of

00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:08.200
those steps that you've
written for yourself.

00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:10.180
So this takes a lot of courage,
because it's one

00:39:10.180 --> 00:39:12.750
thing to identify the issues.

00:39:12.750 --> 00:39:15.040
When I was asking my patients,
what does your body need in

00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:16.460
order to heal, and they
were saying, I need

00:39:16.460 --> 00:39:17.870
to divorce my husband.

00:39:17.870 --> 00:39:19.450
I need to quit my job.

00:39:19.450 --> 00:39:22.166
I need to sell my business.

00:39:22.166 --> 00:39:23.060
That's one thing.

00:39:23.060 --> 00:39:25.820
One woman said I need
to move to Santa Fe.

00:39:25.820 --> 00:39:26.540
And I said, Santa Fe?

00:39:26.540 --> 00:39:27.900
Why Santa Fe?

00:39:27.900 --> 00:39:29.270
And she said, I don't know.

00:39:29.270 --> 00:39:33.100
But I have a vacation home in
Santa Fe and every time I go

00:39:33.100 --> 00:39:36.750
there, all of my symptoms
completely go away.

00:39:36.750 --> 00:39:42.120
So she was brave enough to
actually leave her husband,

00:39:42.120 --> 00:39:46.770
sell her business, move to Santa
Fe, put her mom in a

00:39:46.770 --> 00:39:49.220
nursing home near her because
her mom had been living with

00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:51.540
her and was triggering stress
responses all the time.

00:39:51.540 --> 00:39:54.230
She had always wanted to go to
art school, so she signed up

00:39:54.230 --> 00:39:54.800
for art school.

00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:56.980
She had this whole new community
of artist friends.

00:39:56.980 --> 00:39:58.420
She started dating
this new guy.

00:39:58.420 --> 00:39:59.760
And she calls me three
months later.

00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:02.150
All her symptoms were gone.

00:40:02.150 --> 00:40:04.590
So step five is about writing
the prescription for yourself

00:40:04.590 --> 00:40:08.990
and then finding the courage to
actually take action and to

00:40:08.990 --> 00:40:11.840
put into play what your
intuition knows about what

00:40:11.840 --> 00:40:15.250
your body needs in order to
be optimal, in order to be

00:40:15.250 --> 00:40:19.140
completely vital, in order to be
exploding with life force.

00:40:19.140 --> 00:40:22.620
So step six is one of the
hardest steps, and it's the

00:40:22.620 --> 00:40:23.400
most spiritual.

00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:25.960
Step six is surrender.

00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:28.230
So it's essentially, there are
people out there that have

00:40:28.230 --> 00:40:29.700
done all of this.

00:40:29.700 --> 00:40:31.830
They have so much positive
belief that they're going to

00:40:31.830 --> 00:40:32.190
get better.

00:40:32.190 --> 00:40:35.010
They have the best healers.

00:40:35.010 --> 00:40:37.790
They are listening to their
intuition and doing everything

00:40:37.790 --> 00:40:40.700
they can to diagnose the root
cause of what's triggering

00:40:40.700 --> 00:40:42.970
stress responses in
their bodies.

00:40:42.970 --> 00:40:44.620
They're writing the prescription
for themselves.

00:40:44.620 --> 00:40:45.470
They're being brave.

00:40:45.470 --> 00:40:46.190
They're doing it all.

00:40:46.190 --> 00:40:48.040
And they're still sick.

00:40:48.040 --> 00:40:50.250
One of these is my good friend,
Kris Carr, who I asked

00:40:50.250 --> 00:40:53.350
to write the forward to this
book because she's the best

00:40:53.350 --> 00:40:56.670
example I know of somebody
who is a model patient.

00:40:56.670 --> 00:40:58.980
Kris was in her early '30s when
she was diagnosed with

00:40:58.980 --> 00:41:01.250
stage IV cancer, a type
of cancer for

00:41:01.250 --> 00:41:03.060
which there is no treatment.

00:41:03.060 --> 00:41:05.990
So basically, her doctor said,
well, do what you can to take

00:41:05.990 --> 00:41:09.620
care of your immune system,
and hopefully you'll get

00:41:09.620 --> 00:41:11.080
another 10 years.

00:41:11.080 --> 00:41:13.750
But they didn't think she'd
live beyond that.

00:41:13.750 --> 00:41:16.680
So Kris changed her diet.

00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:19.360
She started following
this, she calls it

00:41:19.360 --> 00:41:20.500
her crazy sexy diet.

00:41:20.500 --> 00:41:22.335
She's "The New York Times"
best-selling author of "Crazy

00:41:22.335 --> 00:41:24.850
Sexy Diet" and "Crazy Sexy
Kitchen," as well

00:41:24.850 --> 00:41:26.170
as two other books.

00:41:26.170 --> 00:41:28.710
And she made a documentary
called "Crazy Sexy Cancer"

00:41:28.710 --> 00:41:30.380
that was about her
healing journey.

00:41:30.380 --> 00:41:32.480
And Kris has done all of this.

00:41:32.480 --> 00:41:34.960
She has the most balanced
whole health cairn of

00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:37.020
anybody I've met.

00:41:37.020 --> 00:41:40.920
I just had Kris come to film a
DVD with me and we did an hour

00:41:40.920 --> 00:41:41.560
long interview.

00:41:41.560 --> 00:41:44.630
It's going to be part of the
pledge special for the public

00:41:44.630 --> 00:41:46.620
television special
that I'm doing.

00:41:46.620 --> 00:41:48.320
There's going to be a whole
package of stuff that's part

00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:50.420
of the public television
special.

00:41:50.420 --> 00:41:51.630
She's really amazing.

00:41:51.630 --> 00:41:54.690
And yet she still has
stage IV cancer.

00:41:54.690 --> 00:41:57.510
So whenever we talk about these
sorts of things, it's

00:41:57.510 --> 00:42:00.560
easy for people to kind of make
the leap to, well, I've

00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:02.480
done everything right.

00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:03.290
I'm still sick.

00:42:03.290 --> 00:42:04.520
I must be doing something
wrong.

00:42:04.520 --> 00:42:06.760
Or I must have caused my
illness in some way.

00:42:06.760 --> 00:42:10.190
And I'm in no way suggesting
that anybody who is sick has

00:42:10.190 --> 00:42:12.030
brought this upon themselves.

00:42:12.030 --> 00:42:15.000
I'm in no way blaming or shaming
or trying to guilt

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:16.350
somebody about an illness.

00:42:16.350 --> 00:42:17.120
It's not about that.

00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:20.080
All that does is trigger
more stress responses.

00:42:20.080 --> 00:42:22.970
So step six is really important
because we have to,

00:42:22.970 --> 00:42:27.150
at some point, accept that
maybe we're battling an

00:42:27.150 --> 00:42:29.530
illness because it's
our wake up call.

00:42:29.530 --> 00:42:35.450
Maybe the illness is something
our souls chose to experience

00:42:35.450 --> 00:42:38.080
in this life so that we can
learn what we're here on this

00:42:38.080 --> 00:42:39.120
Earth to learn.

00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:41.610
Or maybe it's just bad luck.

00:42:41.610 --> 00:42:43.790
But there's a difference between
thinking that you're a

00:42:43.790 --> 00:42:49.120
helpless victim of an illness
and recognizing that your body

00:42:49.120 --> 00:42:50.840
is your business.

00:42:50.840 --> 00:42:52.070
So it's a fine line.

00:42:52.070 --> 00:42:54.190
I was talking to one of my
mentors, Dr. Christiane

00:42:54.190 --> 00:42:56.880
Northrup, about this, and I
said, how do I explain this to

00:42:56.880 --> 00:42:59.000
people without it sounding like
I'm blaming people for

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:00.540
their illness?

00:43:00.540 --> 00:43:03.860
She said, Lissa, we are
responsible to our illness,

00:43:03.860 --> 00:43:06.360
not for our illness.

00:43:06.360 --> 00:43:10.660
Kris Carr says she participates
with her illness.

00:43:10.660 --> 00:43:13.170
In other words, your body
is your business.

00:43:13.170 --> 00:43:16.730
And you have at least some power
over whether or not your

00:43:16.730 --> 00:43:20.940
body is going to be optimally
vital based on being the

00:43:20.940 --> 00:43:23.780
gatekeeper of your own mind.

00:43:23.780 --> 00:43:27.500
So figuring these things out
changed how I think about the

00:43:27.500 --> 00:43:29.780
whole establishment
of medicine.

00:43:29.780 --> 00:43:33.330
And I'm on this mission now
to heal health care.

00:43:33.330 --> 00:43:35.400
To put the care back
in health care.

00:43:35.400 --> 00:43:38.010
And I realized that one of the
biggest reasons that our

00:43:38.010 --> 00:43:42.080
health care system is broken
is because we've forgotten.

00:43:42.080 --> 00:43:44.410
We've forgotten about
the body's innate

00:43:44.410 --> 00:43:46.010
ability to heal itself.

00:43:46.010 --> 00:43:49.510
And we've gotten so invested
in technology that we've

00:43:49.510 --> 00:43:53.010
actually lost touch with one
of the most healing things

00:43:53.010 --> 00:43:55.800
that the body knows how to do.

00:43:55.800 --> 00:44:00.640
And I firmly believe that if
every empowered patient and

00:44:00.640 --> 00:44:04.370
every conscious health care
provider started adopting this

00:44:04.370 --> 00:44:08.220
way of thinking about health,
what I call whole health, that

00:44:08.220 --> 00:44:10.960
it would change our
entire system.

00:44:10.960 --> 00:44:13.530
So I've been going around the
country on this book tour

00:44:13.530 --> 00:44:18.700
speaking to groups of patients
and health care providers and

00:44:18.700 --> 00:44:22.040
really trying to make a shift
in this way of how we think

00:44:22.040 --> 00:44:23.020
about these things.

00:44:23.020 --> 00:44:25.180
Because it all starts
with you.

00:44:25.180 --> 00:44:28.620
It all starts with one empowered
patient, one

00:44:28.620 --> 00:44:31.370
conscious health care provider,
trying to heal the

00:44:31.370 --> 00:44:32.590
rift that has come up.

00:44:32.590 --> 00:44:35.120
I hear so many stories
of that rift.

00:44:35.120 --> 00:44:37.640
There are so many doctors and
patients that have the sort of

00:44:37.640 --> 00:44:41.190
experience my mother just had
with her doctor, when in fact,

00:44:41.190 --> 00:44:44.940
as healers, it's our job
to be the calming

00:44:44.940 --> 00:44:46.610
influence on the amygdala.

00:44:46.610 --> 00:44:49.790
To remember the healing
power of love.

00:44:49.790 --> 00:44:54.220
To show up in support,
nurturing, caring.

00:44:54.220 --> 00:44:56.770
Somehow, I mean, it used to be
that's pretty much all we had

00:44:56.770 --> 00:44:57.640
as doctors, right?

00:44:57.640 --> 00:44:59.860
We didn't have the technology
that we have now.

00:44:59.860 --> 00:45:03.120
We didn't have penicillin and
vaccines and all these amazing

00:45:03.120 --> 00:45:05.030
pieces of technology that
I'm not in any way

00:45:05.030 --> 00:45:06.690
suggesting that we ditch.

00:45:06.690 --> 00:45:09.870
In fact, I mean, my husband cut
two fingers off his left

00:45:09.870 --> 00:45:13.770
hand a while back with a table
saw, and thank god for Dr.

00:45:13.770 --> 00:45:16.010
Jonathan Jones, who
painstakingly spent eight

00:45:16.010 --> 00:45:19.180
hours in surgery with a
microscope, reattaching every

00:45:19.180 --> 00:45:22.116
artery, nerve, and bone in my
husband's fingers so that he

00:45:22.116 --> 00:45:23.710
has 10 fingers today.

00:45:23.710 --> 00:45:25.680
I'm sorry, no amount of
mind-body medicine

00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:27.000
would have done that.

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:28.930
So I'm not in any way suggesting
we shouldn't

00:45:28.930 --> 00:45:30.980
optimize what Western medicine
has to offer.

00:45:30.980 --> 00:45:33.070
I'm just saying it's
not enough.

00:45:33.070 --> 00:45:34.840
We need to not stop there.

00:45:34.840 --> 00:45:40.250
It's not enough just to take the
medicine or even to eat a

00:45:40.250 --> 00:45:42.400
pristine diet and exercise
regularly

00:45:42.400 --> 00:45:43.980
and take your vitamins.

00:45:43.980 --> 00:45:47.720
That we have to take the next
step to figure out how to

00:45:47.720 --> 00:45:50.210
reduce our stress responses and
increase our relaxation

00:45:50.210 --> 00:45:52.820
responses so that the
body can do what it

00:45:52.820 --> 00:45:55.990
does best, heal itself.

00:45:55.990 --> 00:45:57.400
So I want to leave
you with a quote.

00:45:57.400 --> 00:46:00.040
This is from Dr. Albert
Schweitzer.

00:46:00.040 --> 00:46:02.580
and he says, the doctor--

00:46:02.580 --> 00:46:04.762
he said-- hang on, I've
got to get this right.

00:46:04.762 --> 00:46:07.700
I'm bad at quotes.

00:46:07.700 --> 00:46:11.220
He says, I want to tell
you a little secret.

00:46:11.220 --> 00:46:14.170
We doctors, we do nothing.

00:46:14.170 --> 00:46:19.360
We only help and empower
the doctor within.

00:46:19.360 --> 00:46:22.740
So I encourage you to
be that doctor.

00:46:22.740 --> 00:46:26.850
Everyone of you has the power
to be the doctor within.

00:46:26.850 --> 00:46:28.153
Thank you very much.

00:46:28.153 --> 00:46:31.937
[APPLAUSE]

00:46:31.937 --> 00:46:34.160
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:46:34.160 --> 00:46:35.760
The cortisol that happens
when you're in stress.

00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:36.030
DR. LISSA RANKIN: Yes.

00:46:36.030 --> 00:46:38.150
AUDIENCE: I've heard this a
lot, that whether it's the

00:46:38.150 --> 00:46:41.680
tiger or a deadline, your body
experiences it the same way.

00:46:41.680 --> 00:46:42.210
DR. LISSA RANKIN: Right.

00:46:42.210 --> 00:46:45.240
AUDIENCE: And I've also heard
that it takes a long time for

00:46:45.240 --> 00:46:48.620
that cortisol to get back
to a healthy state.

00:46:48.620 --> 00:46:52.900
That it takes a second to spike,
but it can take 10

00:46:52.900 --> 00:46:55.440
hours, 12 hours, a
day to come down.

00:46:55.440 --> 00:46:56.820
But I am not a doctor.

00:46:56.820 --> 00:46:57.240
I don't--

00:46:57.240 --> 00:46:58.100
is this--

00:46:58.100 --> 00:47:00.200
can you speak more to it?

00:47:00.200 --> 00:47:00.830
DR. LISSA RANKIN: Yeah.

00:47:00.830 --> 00:47:03.320
AUDIENCE: How do we know it's
the same, whether it's minor

00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:06.580
or a car crash, that our body's

00:47:06.580 --> 00:47:07.850
interpreting it the same way?

00:47:07.850 --> 00:47:08.510
DR. LISSA RANKIN: Right.

00:47:08.510 --> 00:47:12.800
Well, cortisol is an interesting
beast because it

00:47:12.800 --> 00:47:13.095
fluctuates.

00:47:13.095 --> 00:47:15.540
It's supposed to fluctuate
throughout the day.

00:47:15.540 --> 00:47:19.100
And so cortisol, when we're
actively in stress response,

00:47:19.100 --> 00:47:20.940
the cortisol levels are
going to go up.

00:47:20.940 --> 00:47:23.710
But over time, if we're
chronically, repetitively in

00:47:23.710 --> 00:47:26.980
stress response, the adrenal
glands can get depleted.

00:47:26.980 --> 00:47:30.630
And so our cortisol levels
can actually be low.

00:47:30.630 --> 00:47:34.080
So if you test in the moment,
cortisol levels, for example,

00:47:34.080 --> 00:47:36.260
might be high in the middle
of a stress response.

00:47:36.260 --> 00:47:39.240
But then if you're checking
baseline cortisol levels in

00:47:39.240 --> 00:47:43.260
the morning on a regular day,
those cortisol levels might be

00:47:43.260 --> 00:47:46.970
low because you've essentially
depleted your adrenal glands.

00:47:46.970 --> 00:47:51.380
So it can be very hard to tell
with something like a lab test

00:47:51.380 --> 00:47:54.720
how stressed the body is with
regard to cortisol.

00:47:54.720 --> 00:47:58.910
But what happens is that those
stress responses kick off,

00:47:58.910 --> 00:47:59.880
like you said.

00:47:59.880 --> 00:48:01.730
The cortisol levels can go up.

00:48:01.730 --> 00:48:04.470
But then, over time as we're
getting these, like I was

00:48:04.470 --> 00:48:06.980
talking about when my car went
on the side of the road, we

00:48:06.980 --> 00:48:08.530
get these stress responses
that kind of go

00:48:08.530 --> 00:48:09.900
one after the other.

00:48:09.900 --> 00:48:13.200
So like I said, it's supposed
to only take 90 seconds.

00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:15.230
So it's possible for those
cortisol levels to

00:48:15.230 --> 00:48:16.710
go right back down.

00:48:16.710 --> 00:48:21.030
But for most of us, we have the
ongoing monkey mind mental

00:48:21.030 --> 00:48:24.570
dialogue that follows a
stressful event that leads us

00:48:24.570 --> 00:48:26.220
to continue that process.

00:48:26.220 --> 00:48:28.570
So it very much depends
on that.

00:48:28.570 --> 00:48:30.390
But animals, for example.

00:48:30.390 --> 00:48:32.330
They're much more
pure about this.

00:48:32.330 --> 00:48:34.220
The stress happens.

00:48:34.220 --> 00:48:35.860
They get themselves to safety.

00:48:35.860 --> 00:48:37.980
And then their cortisol levels
go right back down.

00:48:37.980 --> 00:48:38.990
So it's possible.

00:48:38.990 --> 00:48:40.150
We can do that.

00:48:40.150 --> 00:48:42.510
So what I wound up doing, for
example, when I was on the

00:48:42.510 --> 00:48:45.640
side of the road, I was feeling
like, oh my goodness,

00:48:45.640 --> 00:48:47.190
here's my body in
stress response.

00:48:47.190 --> 00:48:47.710
Right?

00:48:47.710 --> 00:48:49.090
I was watching it
like a movie.

00:48:49.090 --> 00:48:51.340
It was very surreal, because
here I am on the road on a

00:48:51.340 --> 00:48:54.800
book tour, talking about
this whole process.

00:48:54.800 --> 00:48:56.220
And now I'm living it twice.

00:48:56.220 --> 00:48:58.830
This thing had just happened
with my mom, and I was

00:48:58.830 --> 00:49:02.040
noticing the stress response
that was coming up of my mom

00:49:02.040 --> 00:49:03.590
potentially having metastatic
cancer.

00:49:03.590 --> 00:49:06.470
My dad died of metastatic cancer
seven years ago, so for

00:49:06.470 --> 00:49:09.680
both of us that was like a huge
trauma, kind of reopening

00:49:09.680 --> 00:49:10.690
that old wound.

00:49:10.690 --> 00:49:13.310
And the way in which my mind was
working around that, like

00:49:13.310 --> 00:49:15.080
we don't have a diagnosis,
right?

00:49:15.080 --> 00:49:17.540
There's no need to actually
be scared yet.

00:49:17.540 --> 00:49:20.730
And yet I was terrified about
my mom's MRI because

00:49:20.730 --> 00:49:23.000
literally, I had talked to the
doctor and I said, is there

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:24.800
anything it could be other
than metastatic cancer?

00:49:24.800 --> 00:49:26.790
And he said no.

00:49:26.790 --> 00:49:28.900
And so I was terrified.

00:49:28.900 --> 00:49:30.830
And the same thing when I was
on the side of road, right?

00:49:30.830 --> 00:49:33.670
I'm noticing this tendency that
we have to make up all

00:49:33.670 --> 00:49:35.590
these stories about things.

00:49:35.590 --> 00:49:38.940
So I sat there, and what I did
when my car, when I pulled my

00:49:38.940 --> 00:49:40.590
car off to the side of the
road, and I realized,

00:49:40.590 --> 00:49:42.190
OK, I'm safe now.

00:49:42.190 --> 00:49:46.700
I no longer need to be
in stress response.

00:49:46.700 --> 00:49:47.860
I don't need to protect
myself.

00:49:47.860 --> 00:49:49.400
Thank you, amygdala, well done.

00:49:49.400 --> 00:49:51.080
Good job.

00:49:51.080 --> 00:49:53.530
So I literally sat
down and I did--

00:49:53.530 --> 00:49:55.780
there's an exercise in the book
based on Herbert Benson,

00:49:55.780 --> 00:49:58.300
this Harvard doctor, has done
a lot of research on the

00:49:58.300 --> 00:49:59.310
relaxation response.

00:49:59.310 --> 00:50:00.940
He wrote a wonderful book
in the '70s called "The

00:50:00.940 --> 00:50:04.650
Relaxation Response." So I
practiced his technique, which

00:50:04.650 --> 00:50:07.250
is based on a type of
transcendental meditation.

00:50:07.250 --> 00:50:09.810
And it basically is this
technique where--

00:50:09.810 --> 00:50:11.230
we can do it right now.

00:50:11.230 --> 00:50:13.220
I'll give you the quick
and dirty 30

00:50:13.220 --> 00:50:15.260
second relaxation response.

00:50:15.260 --> 00:50:19.510
If you close your eyes for just
a minute and just focus

00:50:19.510 --> 00:50:20.760
on your breath.

00:50:23.580 --> 00:50:26.850
And I want you to pick
a one word mantra.

00:50:26.850 --> 00:50:31.270
Something that resonates with
you, like "one" or "peace" or

00:50:31.270 --> 00:50:36.440
"love." I chose the word "safe"
when I was on the side

00:50:36.440 --> 00:50:38.660
of the road.

00:50:38.660 --> 00:50:42.830
And as you breathe, I want you
to just repeat that one word

00:50:42.830 --> 00:50:44.690
mantra on the exhale.

00:50:50.960 --> 00:50:52.780
Now, you may notice
other thoughts

00:50:52.780 --> 00:50:54.030
coming into your mind.

00:50:56.590 --> 00:50:57.330
And that's all right.

00:50:57.330 --> 00:51:00.020
Just passively disregard the
other thoughts as they come

00:51:00.020 --> 00:51:01.570
into your mind.

00:51:01.570 --> 00:51:02.270
Just notice it.

00:51:02.270 --> 00:51:04.225
Hello, remembering.

00:51:04.225 --> 00:51:07.310
Or hello, planning.

00:51:07.310 --> 00:51:10.440
And just keep coming back
to your breath, to

00:51:10.440 --> 00:51:11.690
that one word mantra.

00:51:23.070 --> 00:51:26.190
All right, go ahead and
open your eyes again.

00:51:26.190 --> 00:51:28.680
So if you were in one of Herbert
Benson's many, many,

00:51:28.680 --> 00:51:30.780
many research studies, he would
have had you do that

00:51:30.780 --> 00:51:34.530
process for 10 to 20 minutes
once or twice per day.

00:51:34.530 --> 00:51:38.070
It's been proven to aid
in almost every

00:51:38.070 --> 00:51:39.330
single illness out there.

00:51:39.330 --> 00:51:40.550
He's got the data.

00:51:40.550 --> 00:51:41.405
It's clear.

00:51:41.405 --> 00:51:43.390
It's that simple.

00:51:43.390 --> 00:51:45.540
So I sat there on the side of
the road, and before I called

00:51:45.540 --> 00:51:48.090
my husband to find out what my
AAA number was, and before I

00:51:48.090 --> 00:51:50.490
called AAA, and before I called
my best friend to tell

00:51:50.490 --> 00:51:54.280
her I'd just blown out two of
her tires, I did a little 10

00:51:54.280 --> 00:51:55.600
minute relaxation response.

00:51:55.600 --> 00:51:58.640
Because I knew, even though it
was going to take 10 minutes

00:51:58.640 --> 00:52:02.180
away from me getting to my
event, that the only way I was

00:52:02.180 --> 00:52:03.870
going to show up really
in service at that

00:52:03.870 --> 00:52:06.710
event is if I was calm.

00:52:06.710 --> 00:52:10.170
So putting ourselves into the
relaxation response can be

00:52:10.170 --> 00:52:11.270
that simple.

00:52:11.270 --> 00:52:16.440
And any type of meditation
works, but it's not even that.

00:52:16.440 --> 00:52:18.500
And Herbert Benson found you
don't even need to close your

00:52:18.500 --> 00:52:21.820
eyes and be seated in
order to do this.

00:52:21.820 --> 00:52:26.240
You can repeat this one word
mantra on the exhale while

00:52:26.240 --> 00:52:28.870
focusing on your breath and
passively disregarding other

00:52:28.870 --> 00:52:30.560
thoughts that come
into your mind.

00:52:30.560 --> 00:52:31.900
You can do it while
you're shopping.

00:52:31.900 --> 00:52:33.680
You can do it while
you're driving.

00:52:33.680 --> 00:52:35.930
You can do it while you're
making dinner.

00:52:35.930 --> 00:52:37.530
And it's been scientifically
proven.

00:52:37.530 --> 00:52:39.850
He puts everybody--

00:52:39.850 --> 00:52:41.990
monitors them, monitors
their blood levels.

00:52:41.990 --> 00:52:44.710
Scientifically proven to put you
into relaxation response

00:52:44.710 --> 00:52:47.500
every time if you can quiet the
mind and you can calm the

00:52:47.500 --> 00:52:49.030
amygdala in that way.

00:52:49.030 --> 00:52:51.380
But there are some really easy,
fun ways to put yourself

00:52:51.380 --> 00:52:53.200
into relaxation response.

00:52:53.200 --> 00:52:56.030
Laughter is a great one.

00:52:56.030 --> 00:52:58.150
Norman Cousins wrote the
"Anatomy of an Illness" all

00:52:58.150 --> 00:53:01.130
about how he healed his
ankylosing spondylitis by

00:53:01.130 --> 00:53:04.490
watching Marx Brothers movies.

00:53:04.490 --> 00:53:05.390
Sex.

00:53:05.390 --> 00:53:07.140
Another fun one.

00:53:07.140 --> 00:53:11.030
So playing with animals.

00:53:11.030 --> 00:53:13.520
The healing act of generosity,
that's one a lot of people

00:53:13.520 --> 00:53:14.830
don't think about.

00:53:14.830 --> 00:53:16.800
I just saw a great news
article about

00:53:16.800 --> 00:53:17.760
this guy Andy Mackie.

00:53:17.760 --> 00:53:19.350
He's 71 years old.

00:53:19.350 --> 00:53:22.490
He's had nine heart surgeries.

00:53:22.490 --> 00:53:25.140
And he was taking 15 medications
for his heart that

00:53:25.140 --> 00:53:27.290
were giving him all kinds of
terrible side effects.

00:53:27.290 --> 00:53:29.060
So he finally went to his
doctors and he said, I've got

00:53:29.060 --> 00:53:30.655
to get off these drugs.

00:53:30.655 --> 00:53:32.370
It's making me miserable.

00:53:32.370 --> 00:53:34.280
And they said, well, if you stop
your medications, you'll

00:53:34.280 --> 00:53:35.780
die within a year.

00:53:35.780 --> 00:53:37.750
So he said, well, if I'm going
to die within a year, I might

00:53:37.750 --> 00:53:39.810
as well die going out and doing
something I've always

00:53:39.810 --> 00:53:40.630
wanted to do.

00:53:40.630 --> 00:53:42.900
So he took the money that he
was spending on those 15

00:53:42.900 --> 00:53:46.500
medications and he bought 300
harmonicas and gave them away

00:53:46.500 --> 00:53:48.990
to kids in public schools,
complete with harmonica

00:53:48.990 --> 00:53:51.090
lessons from himself.

00:53:51.090 --> 00:53:53.060
So a month later, he
was still alive.

00:53:53.060 --> 00:53:56.230
So he took the same money and he
bought 300 more harmonicas.

00:53:56.230 --> 00:54:03.860
And it's now been 11 years and
16,000 harmonicas later, and

00:54:03.860 --> 00:54:07.700
Andy Mackie is still alive,
giving out harmonicas to kids.

00:54:07.700 --> 00:54:12.180
So we can calm our amygdalas
in a whole variety of ways,

00:54:12.180 --> 00:54:14.350
and that's part of what you're
going to want to write in the

00:54:14.350 --> 00:54:15.900
prescription for yourself.

00:54:15.900 --> 00:54:19.540
How can I add more relaxation
responses to my life?

00:54:19.540 --> 00:54:20.060
FEMALE SPEAKER: Thanks.

00:54:20.060 --> 00:54:21.780
Thanks a lot for coming.

00:54:21.780 --> 00:54:22.170
DR. LISSA RANKIN:
Thank you all.

00:54:22.170 --> 00:54:23.500
FEMALE SPEAKER: We're
out of time.

00:54:23.500 --> 00:54:24.390
DR. LISSA RANKIN: Thank you.

00:54:24.390 --> 00:54:28.890
[APPLAUSE]
