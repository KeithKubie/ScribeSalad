[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.832 --> 00:00:07.530
SARAH THOMSON: Good
afternoon, everyone.

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:09.950
Thank you so much for joining
us here in the audience

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:11.690
and on the Livestream.

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:12.620
My name is Sarah.

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:16.555
I head up business development
for indie games on Google Play.

00:00:16.555 --> 00:00:17.180
KOBI GLICK: Hi.

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.720
I'm Kobi.

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.699
I'm a product manager
for Google Play.

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:20.490
MILENA NIKOLIC: Hi.

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.350
I'm Milena, an engineering
manager on Google Play.

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:27.790
We're here to talk to you about
some cool tools we're launching

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:31.400
in Google Play Developer Console
to help you better release

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.840
your apps and games.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.480
We want to make sure you
can launch with confidence,

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.810
and better target your apps and
games with the right devices

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:44.550
in a way that makes great
experiences for all your users.

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.620
We'll start with a quick
recap of everything

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.140
that changed in this
area in the past year,

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.630
followed by talking about
some big improvements we've

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:54.540
made to the release management
flows in Google Play

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:56.890
Console in the past year.

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.080
We will then go on to
announce new features, changes

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.230
to app signing, new
device catalog and device

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:05.099
targeting tools.

00:01:05.099 --> 00:01:06.810
We have heard that
some of these areas

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.330
are the ones where you
would like to see feedback

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.170
and insights from Google most.

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.916
So we're very excited to
show you what have built.

00:01:14.916 --> 00:01:17.300
KOBI GLICK: So before we
get to the new features,

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.590
let's start with a quick recap
of what happened in this space

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.440
in the last year.

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.010
So exactly a year
ago, at Google I/O,

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.460
we launched open beta,
a new way for users

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.550
to discover your apps
running beta on Google Play

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:32.810
and join them.

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.380
Users can find your app, search
them, join the beta directly

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.420
from the Store Listing
page, and leave you

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.100
with product review, which you
can see in the Play Console.

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.330
Open beta is a great way for
you to test your new updates

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:51.680
before you launch them
live to your users.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.650
So this open beta allows
you to really scale

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:56.880
to programs in Play.

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.500
And in the last
year alone, we've

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.360
seen more than 100 million
beta testers on Google Play.

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.000
There's another number which
we're really excited about,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.509
which is a 4x growth in
the number of apps running

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.390
a large beta program on Play.

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.220
We get great feedback
from a developers,

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.920
like WhatsApp telling
us how open beta allows

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.750
them to get critical feedback
from millions of beta testers.

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.960
It allows them to experiment
with new features.

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.880
And it's one of the
key ways they're

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.730
able to deliver such an awesome
messaging experience to so

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.480
many users globally.

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.530
And we get this
feedback from Tim Sehn,

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.430
VP of engineering at Snap.

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.730
By the way, Snap with one of the
early adopters of beta testing

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:42.720
on Google Play.

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.630
They used it for more
than four years now.

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.110
Mr. Sehn tells us
how open beta allows

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.240
them to deliver such a
stable op experience,

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.780
and is key to their ability
to innovate with new app

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.790
experiences.

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.370
SARAH THOMSON: So together
with those changes,

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.880
we've also launched a developer
program called Early Access.

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.251
Has anyone here given
Early Access a try?

00:03:06.251 --> 00:03:06.750
Yeah?

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.110
A couple of hands?

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:11.660
If you haven't, I highly
recommend you to check it out.

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:14.770
So this is a program that will
allow you to put your apps

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:18.430
or games in front
of early adopters

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.170
while your game is
still in development.

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:22.595
So the audience
of early testers,

00:03:22.595 --> 00:03:24.220
they're going to be
able to provide you

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.530
with really valuable feedback.

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:29.560
We've captured and continue
to grow a significant user

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.266
base of highly
engaged users that

00:03:32.266 --> 00:03:33.640
are more than
willing to give you

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:38.200
that detailed granular
feedback around how your game

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.390
or how your app is performing.

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.960
So currently, we have
25 million users,

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:49.060
and counting, that are actually
leveraging that Early Access

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.260
program since last year 2016.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.060
So one great example
here is Omnidrone.

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:00.400
This is developer of Titan
Brawl, and they're from Spain.

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.920
And they entered
into Early Access,

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:08.420
and they saw more than 400,000
users enter into the game.

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:12.070
They started by
focusing on engagement.

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:14.620
That was the first thing
they decided to iterate on.

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:18.010
They then went on to
iterate on retention

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:20.810
and, finally, monetization.

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:23.440
So with Early Access,
they were able to improve

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.760
their engagement rate by 50%.

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:28.060
I mean, that's a
really meaty number.

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.510
And then later,
monetization went up by 20%.

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:34.510
This was even before they
actually launched publicly.

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:37.780
So we're really elated to be
able to see these Android-only

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:40.780
tools and services move
the needle in a really

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:43.870
meaningful way towards the
success of their game's launch.

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:49.550
And Omnidrone has told us
that, within Early Access,

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:53.090
they were able to get enough
traffic into their game

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:55.430
to really analyze and
improve their retention,

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:59.750
as well as take on
their marketing assets

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:02.930
and test that in-store
experiments even before going

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:03.980
live.

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:05.990
They also told us that
that private feedback

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:07.780
was invaluable.

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:10.550
You see, one of the great
features about Early Access is

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:14.366
that users cannot rate your
game or app at that time.

00:05:14.366 --> 00:05:16.490
So all that great feedback
you're getting from them

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:19.700
does not actually impact
your store ratings.

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:23.060
It's helped them to improve
their game experience based

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:26.030
on that user feedback, which is
always a really great practice

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:28.481
to follow.

00:05:28.481 --> 00:05:30.230
MILENA NIKOLIC: The
launch of Early Access

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:34.280
is just one way in which
Android and Play are continually

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:35.600
evolving.

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:38.360
In order to keep pace with
this and in order to give you

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:41.160
guys the tools to use all
the functionality we built

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.670
to do its full potential,
we have recently

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:46.160
overhauled the entire
release management section

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.560
in the Google Play Console.

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:51.740
App releases replays
the previous APK page

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:54.440
and introduced some pretty
significant changes in the way

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:56.330
how you prepare
your next release

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:59.220
and roll it out to users.

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:01.170
Firstly, we
introduced the concept

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:04.290
of a "release" and the
consistent terminology

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:06.120
throughout the flow,
including things

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:09.400
like "rollout" or "artifact."

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:12.670
Is anyone in the
audience using MultiAPK?

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:13.170
Yep.

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:13.510
Few.

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:14.570
SARAH THOMSON:
Yeah, quite a few.

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:16.111
MILENA NIKOLIC: So
concept of release

00:06:16.111 --> 00:06:20.040
is generally useful, but
especially so for you guys.

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:23.460
It gives you a holistic
weight, look at all the APKs

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:26.610
that are active at the
time in a holistic way.

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:29.820
And also to see which one
of them were added now,

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:33.754
and which ones were carried
over from previous releases.

00:06:33.754 --> 00:06:35.420
One more important
change is the ability

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:37.040
to separate the
release preparation

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:39.470
process from its rollout.

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:41.390
Previously, you had
to do this weird dance

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:44.870
where you upload some new APKs,
you deactivate the old ones,

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:47.640
and then you have to publish
the whole lot at once.

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:49.670
Now, you can create
a draft release

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:52.940
and save it in various
stages of completion.

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:55.220
You can then go for
lunch, come back,

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:56.960
make some other
changes in the Console,

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:59.610
and only roll it out when
you're really ready and sure.

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:04.360
One of the primary
goals of the new flow

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:07.630
was to enable you to
release with confidence.

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:09.910
We got plenty of
feedback from developers,

00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:12.310
like yourselves, that
they're being scared

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:14.090
to publish because
they're not sure what

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:17.530
are going to be the
consequences to their existing

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:18.650
and new users.

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:21.820
We also got some feedback that
some of our error messages

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:23.380
are not very clear.

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:26.770
So these were critical as
we were designing new flows.

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:29.260
We made sure that
everything is much more

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.390
explicit in the new flows.

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:33.220
We now provide
confirmation options

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:35.350
at various points
in the flow, which

00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:38.740
reduces the risk of accidentally
doing a bad or unintended push

00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:41.020
for your users.

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:42.730
For example, we now
have a new page,

00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:46.350
which allows you to review the
release before you roll it out.

00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:48.810
This page will
highlight any issues,

00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:53.160
and warn or even block you,
depending on the severity.

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:54.660
As part of this
process, we actually

00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:58.050
changed some of the previously
very strict rules around how

00:07:58.050 --> 00:08:01.440
we decide to warn or block you.

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:02.880
This especially
applies to things

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:06.010
like upgrades and targeting
across the Android device

00:08:06.010 --> 00:08:07.320
space.

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:09.030
At the same time, we
added some new rules

00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:12.090
to give you more visibility into
various other things that could

00:08:12.090 --> 00:08:13.600
go wrong with your release.

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:16.620
For example, we now
warn you if you're

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:18.450
introducing a your
permission, which

00:08:18.450 --> 00:08:21.390
will reduce your
app's update rate,

00:08:21.390 --> 00:08:24.990
or when you are excluding some
devices which you previously

00:08:24.990 --> 00:08:27.015
targeting.

00:08:27.015 --> 00:08:28.860
KOBI GLICK: Another
change we made

00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:31.170
with the new flow is
making staged rollout front

00:08:31.170 --> 00:08:32.280
and center.

00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:33.480
Now, we love staged rollout.

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:36.600
We think it's a great way for
you to confidently release

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:38.309
your updates to users.

00:08:38.309 --> 00:08:40.080
You start with a new seed.

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:44.580
If it performs correctly, you
update until you hit 100%.

00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:46.890
In the new flow, we made
the UI front and center.

00:08:46.890 --> 00:08:49.890
It's very easy to
set staged rollout.

00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:51.690
We also show you
how many devices

00:08:51.690 --> 00:08:54.240
you will target with each
percentage of the rollout.

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:57.180
And one feature that we already
got some positive developer

00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:01.320
feedback on is the new ability
to set custom percentages,

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:03.300
like the 3% you see right here.

00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:08.580
Since launching
the new flow, we've

00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:10.470
seen a number we're
really excited about.

00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:14.340
We've seen a 50% increase
in the number of developers

00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:16.260
that are using staged rollout.

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:17.320
We love seeing this.

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:20.310
Staged rollout is a really
recommended best practice,

00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:23.670
and many over top developers
use it practically

00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:26.726
to release each one
of their app updates.

00:09:26.726 --> 00:09:28.350
There's some other
really cool features

00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:30.540
that we launched as
part of the new flow.

00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:33.870
For example, you can see
a log of your release.

00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:38.160
So when you push to
5%, 10%, or 100%,

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:41.520
you can see a history of all
your historical releases.

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:43.410
And one feature we
think is really cool

00:09:43.410 --> 00:09:46.290
is your ability to download
historical APKs from the Play

00:09:46.290 --> 00:09:47.040
Console.

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:49.290
So if you're trying to
reproduce a bug from one

00:09:49.290 --> 00:09:51.960
of your previous releases,
you go to the Play Console

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:53.430
and you download that APK.

00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:59.130
Moving forward, we're
getting ready for the world

00:09:59.130 --> 00:10:00.780
beyond the APK.

00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:02.430
Starting today, and
you probably heard

00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:05.230
the announcement earlier
in the developer keynote,

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:08.280
we're opening publishing
of Android Instant Apps

00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:11.850
from the Play Console
using a very similar flow

00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:13.750
to the [INAUDIBLE]
you're all familiar with,

00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:16.770
with updating your
regular installed apps.

00:10:16.770 --> 00:10:19.620
So it should be very
easy for you guys

00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:23.130
to come to the Play Console and
publish your Android Instant

00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:25.860
Apps starting today.

00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:27.570
If you want to hear
more about that,

00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:31.110
come to the session intro to
Android Instant Apps tomorrow

00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:33.690
1:30 PM, right here on Stage 2.

00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:38.480
Now there are two features
that are coming soon,

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:41.210
and we think you'll be
pretty excited about.

00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:44.610
If you're using our publishing
APIs to programmatically push

00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:48.110
your app updates, soon,
we'll expose a new endpoint

00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:51.350
for releases, allowing you to
push the change to the Play

00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:53.630
Console But then go
to the Play Console

00:10:53.630 --> 00:10:55.880
you like, look at
the validation pages

00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:57.860
that Milena mentioned
before to understand

00:10:57.860 --> 00:11:01.460
the state of your release, and
only then make the publishing

00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:05.680
action from the Play Console
And then also with the best

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:09.390
tradition of Google, launching
and iterating, once we launched

00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:12.180
the new flow, we heard your
feedback loud and clear

00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:14.800
how we should further improve
the process around release

00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:15.300
notes.

00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:17.640
Or as we call them, What's New.

00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:20.860
We know that today, it's a bit
of a time sink for you guys,

00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:23.520
especially if you
manage release notes

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:25.440
across multiple languages.

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:28.350
Therefore, I'm happy to let you
know that very soon, like you

00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:31.800
see here, we will
offer you a new format

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:35.460
allowing you to edit all
your release notes offline.

00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:37.950
And then with a single
copy and paste action,

00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:40.770
move into the Play Console with
a single click of a button.

00:11:40.770 --> 00:11:42.270
We think it will
be a big time saver

00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:44.144
for you guys and a
feature you'd really like.

00:11:46.430 --> 00:11:49.310
So we've had a few developers
now using the new flow

00:11:49.310 --> 00:11:51.440
and sharing their
experience with us.

00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:55.010
For example, Freeletics here,
developer of health and fitness

00:11:55.010 --> 00:11:58.580
apps, tells us that the new
Manage Releases page gives them

00:11:58.580 --> 00:12:01.380
a greatly improved status
overview of their release.

00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:06.070
And Deliveroo's pretty
pleased with the ease

00:12:06.070 --> 00:12:08.830
of use and convenient
overview that they now

00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:10.810
get with staged rollouts.

00:12:10.810 --> 00:12:12.550
Now, they can see
exactly how many

00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:16.420
installs that they are expected
to get to that stage rollout,

00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:19.000
while providing them with a
whole new and exciting level

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.800
of control.

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:26.140
OK, so now you guys can actually
roll out your app and game

00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:28.030
to users with higher confidence.

00:12:28.030 --> 00:12:31.360
But you still want to understand
how your release is actually

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:32.180
performing.

00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:34.540
Well, this is why we're
launching another great feature

00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:37.540
right here, the
Release Dashboard.

00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:40.690
Here, you'll be able to
track your release health.

00:12:40.690 --> 00:12:45.580
So for example, you can see
what your crash rate is doing,

00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:48.280
what the ratings
changes look like,

00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:51.940
or how is your uninstall
rates fluctuating.

00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:54.550
This is based on
hourly aggregated data.

00:12:54.550 --> 00:12:57.070
So it gives you a
really powerful way

00:12:57.070 --> 00:13:00.910
to keep track of your release
as it's getting adopted.

00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:03.490
You can compare the
release performance

00:13:03.490 --> 00:13:06.130
to a previous release,
which we think you guys are

00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:07.027
going to really love.

00:13:07.027 --> 00:13:08.110
I mean, what do you think?

00:13:08.110 --> 00:13:09.930
Does that sound cool?

00:13:09.930 --> 00:13:10.430
Awesome.

00:13:10.430 --> 00:13:13.730
[APPLAUSE]

00:13:13.730 --> 00:13:16.250
So hopefully, you already
know that if you're

00:13:16.250 --> 00:13:18.500
running a staged
rollout, you can actually

00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:22.250
halt it at any time if you're
detecting any kind of issues.

00:13:22.250 --> 00:13:23.840
So for instance,
if you're noticing

00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:25.790
your crash rate is
going up or there's

00:13:25.790 --> 00:13:29.810
a big spike in uninstall
rates, you can react quickly.

00:13:29.810 --> 00:13:33.680
If you halt a staged rollout,
and the users that didn't get

00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:35.390
that update, they won't get it.

00:13:35.390 --> 00:13:36.800
So rest assured.

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:39.140
Then you can focus on
investigating and fixing

00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:43.260
those bugs before
releasing the new build.

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:45.870
So if you guys want a deeper
dive into that awesome Release

00:13:45.870 --> 00:13:48.000
Dashboard I was just
referencing, along

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.100
with some other cool
features that we're launching

00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:52.680
to help you improve
your app health,

00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:56.310
go check out Making data
on Play work for you,

00:13:56.310 --> 00:14:01.770
tomorrow, 1:30 PM,
over at Stage 1.

00:14:01.770 --> 00:14:04.330
MILENA NIKOLIC:
OK, let's move on.

00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:09.000
As Android developers, you're
signing key ensures security

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.830
and integrity of your app.

00:14:10.830 --> 00:14:12.870
That makes it very important.

00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:18.180
Lost or compromised keys
are a very serious issue.

00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:22.030
I hope that this didn't
happen to any of you.

00:14:22.030 --> 00:14:24.820
But in fact, this is one of the
most commonly-reported issues

00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:28.590
to operations team.

00:14:28.590 --> 00:14:30.540
This is why we
very excited to be

00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:33.120
announcing another
important feature,

00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:35.310
Google Play app signing.

00:14:35.310 --> 00:14:39.010
If you join this program, you
let Google Play manage your key

00:14:39.010 --> 00:14:43.310
and sign your app before
delivering it to users.

00:14:43.310 --> 00:14:47.090
For new apps, we can simply
generate a key for you.

00:14:47.090 --> 00:14:48.980
For existing apps,
we provide you

00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:51.380
a flow through which
you can securely

00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:53.870
hand over the keys to us.

00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:56.990
After that, you don't have to
worry about balancing security

00:14:56.990 --> 00:15:00.500
and convenience of access by,
for example, storing your key

00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:02.610
in a version control system.

00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:04.620
You can even delete it.

00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:06.520
Apps uploaded to
Play will still be

00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:10.500
signed, but with a separate
upload key, which we use

00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:13.770
as a secondary authentication.

00:15:13.770 --> 00:15:16.000
This one can always
be replaced if needed.

00:15:18.817 --> 00:15:20.900
SARAH THOMSON: OK, so first
of all, this guy right

00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:22.340
here is super-excited about it.

00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:23.589
I just want to point that out.

00:15:23.589 --> 00:15:25.160
Thanks for the thumbs-up.

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:27.710
We've had several
partners actually using

00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:30.740
Google Play app signing for a
while now, and they love it.

00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:31.820
Surprise.

00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:34.550
Here, Robin Hood speaks
to the layer of safety

00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:36.830
that we've added,
while at the same time

00:15:36.830 --> 00:15:40.987
it's just eliminated that worry
of having lost or stolen keys.

00:15:40.987 --> 00:15:42.320
And I guess I don't have to ask.

00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:43.580
I mean, how cool is this?

00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:44.086
Pretty cool.

00:15:44.086 --> 00:15:45.460
MILENA NIKOLIC:
It's pretty cool.

00:15:45.460 --> 00:15:46.686
SARAH THOMSON: Yeah.

00:15:46.686 --> 00:15:48.560
MILENA NIKOLIC: OK, so
now that Google Play

00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:52.650
is signing your app, you can
probably guess what comes next.

00:15:52.650 --> 00:15:55.520
We can also start
optimizing it on our behalf.

00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:57.200
The first optimization
that we've

00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:59.360
started with a few
partners is resource

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:01.400
stripping optimizations.

00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:03.700
If you opt into
this, you can give us

00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:07.280
a universal, or a
so-called Fap APK,

00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:09.290
based on which we
will automatically

00:16:09.290 --> 00:16:12.770
generate the device-specific
APKs by stripping

00:16:12.770 --> 00:16:17.190
redundant resources for native
libraries and screen densities.

00:16:17.190 --> 00:16:19.830
For example, when delivering
your app to an [INAUDIBLE]

00:16:19.830 --> 00:16:22.920
phone, we will make sure we
strip out all the x86 native

00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:24.084
libraries.

00:16:24.084 --> 00:16:26.250
This way, the APK will send
out to users [INAUDIBLE]

00:16:26.250 --> 00:16:30.180
smaller, taking less bandwidth,
less space on their disk,

00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:33.780
without requiring you
guys to use MultiAPK.

00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:37.380
This way, we're seeing
over 20% APK size savings

00:16:37.380 --> 00:16:38.800
with some of the partners.

00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:40.380
So make sure you
opt in and try this

00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:44.220
out when it becomes available.

00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:46.170
We are very excited
about Google Play app

00:16:46.170 --> 00:16:49.220
signing and all the app
optimization we can bring you

00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:51.590
on top of it in the future.

00:16:51.590 --> 00:16:55.580
This program is optional, but we
really hope you decide to join.

00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:58.880
To learn more about app signing
with Google, its security

00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:01.580
benefits, and the
side gains you can

00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:04.190
get with the various
optimizations,

00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:06.650
please come to the How
to secure and optimize

00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:09.950
your app with Google Play app
signing talk tomorrow at 2:30

00:17:09.950 --> 00:17:13.540
PM on Stage 1.

00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:14.649
KOBI GLICK: OK.

00:17:14.649 --> 00:17:15.940
Now I want to tell you a story.

00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:17.470
A real story.

00:17:17.470 --> 00:17:19.540
When I joined Google
few years ago,

00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:21.220
my friend, who is an
Android developer,

00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:23.290
asked me for just one thing.

00:17:23.290 --> 00:17:26.496
Can we do anything about
this page you see right here?

00:17:26.496 --> 00:17:28.329
You're probably all
familiar with this page.

00:17:28.329 --> 00:17:29.620
So I asked him, why?

00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:31.180
What's wrong with this page?

00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:34.480
And he's like, well, there are
thousands of devices there.

00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:36.910
There's very little
info on each device.

00:17:36.910 --> 00:17:40.150
Many devices actually have
the same name again and again,

00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:44.640
and managing devices in
general is busy work.

00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:48.540
Now, the Android ecosystem
has grown so significantly

00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:50.610
because it offers
different devices

00:17:50.610 --> 00:17:54.150
with different capabilities
at various price points.

00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:56.670
At the same time, it's
important that users

00:17:56.670 --> 00:17:59.880
don't get an app or a game
that their device doesn't

00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:01.150
have the hardware to support.

00:18:01.150 --> 00:18:03.300
You know what happens.

00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:05.340
The user gets annoyed
because the app

00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:06.900
doesn't work on their device.

00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:09.240
And then you get annoyed
because the user leaves

00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:12.120
a one-star review, blaming
your app for something

00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:14.790
that isn't really your fault.

00:18:14.790 --> 00:18:16.610
It's really important
for us that you're

00:18:16.610 --> 00:18:19.970
able to deliver great
experience to your users.

00:18:19.970 --> 00:18:23.510
And to be able to do that, we
need to provide you visibility

00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:25.460
into the device space.

00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:27.830
It's especially important
for game developers

00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:30.710
because we're aware that
you guys, in many cases,

00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:34.190
build your games according
to a reference device spec.

00:18:34.190 --> 00:18:37.910
Therefore, we're very excited
to announce that, today, we're

00:18:37.910 --> 00:18:40.100
launching a new device
catalog in the Play Console.

00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:40.600
Woo-hoo.

00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:42.758
[APPLAUSE]

00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:48.930
With this new and
shiny catalog, you

00:18:48.930 --> 00:18:52.380
can see the full hardware
spec for thousands

00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:56.070
of devices that were certified
by Google for the Google Mobile

00:18:56.070 --> 00:18:57.780
suite of apps.

00:18:57.780 --> 00:19:00.030
You see here what we
call the card view.

00:19:00.030 --> 00:19:02.010
But we also provide
you with a list view,

00:19:02.010 --> 00:19:04.710
allowing you to run all
kind of quick operations

00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:07.080
on a set of devices.

00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:09.930
Take a moment to compare the
old UI versus the new UI.

00:19:09.930 --> 00:19:12.360
Pretty awesome.

00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:15.400
OK, so what do you get
in this new catalog?

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:18.270
So first, you get
a full device spec.

00:19:18.270 --> 00:19:23.250
You get information like RAM,
system on chip, GPU, CPU,

00:19:23.250 --> 00:19:26.550
screen size and density,
and the supported Android OS

00:19:26.550 --> 00:19:30.000
versions for each one of
those thousands of devices.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.610
You can search devices by
any of these attributes.

00:19:33.610 --> 00:19:36.150
For example, you can run the
search that you see right here.

00:19:36.150 --> 00:19:38.280
What we call the filter.

00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:41.260
You can search for all devices,
for example, with Android SDK

00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:44.250
24 plus and a specific GPU.

00:19:44.250 --> 00:19:46.500
And one of the
features I like best.

00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:49.140
Every time you
search for devices,

00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:51.450
and we show you one
or many devices,

00:19:51.450 --> 00:19:54.940
we also show you your app
performance on those devices.

00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:58.260
So we show you how many
installs, how much revenue,

00:19:58.260 --> 00:20:01.260
and what's the average rating
that those devices contribute

00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:02.380
to your app.

00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:04.590
This is super-important
when you're making decisions

00:20:04.590 --> 00:20:08.190
like prioritizing bug fixes
or making device exclusion

00:20:08.190 --> 00:20:08.790
decisions.

00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:14.230
When we gave the new catalog
to Pixelberry Studios,

00:20:14.230 --> 00:20:16.240
one of our testing
partners, it helped

00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:18.730
them avoid making a
big mistake on day one.

00:20:18.730 --> 00:20:20.050
Literally on day one.

00:20:20.050 --> 00:20:21.940
So they were about
to exclude a device.

00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:24.160
But actually, with
the new catalog,

00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:28.510
they suddenly saw that it
has meaningful installs, 4.6

00:20:28.510 --> 00:20:31.940
rating, and actually some
meaningful revenue, too.

00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:34.720
So they avoided excluding
it, and therefore avoiding

00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:36.850
making a major mistake.

00:20:36.850 --> 00:20:39.970
Pixelberry Studio
tells us this tool

00:20:39.970 --> 00:20:42.190
will be a game changer
for the studio.

00:20:44.782 --> 00:20:46.330
MILENA NIKOLIC: Cool.

00:20:46.330 --> 00:20:48.550
Another really cool feature
of the device catalog

00:20:48.550 --> 00:20:50.290
are device groups.

00:20:50.290 --> 00:20:52.390
It is quite common to
have multiple devices

00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:55.190
with the same brand name,
but different system on chip

00:20:55.190 --> 00:20:56.020
configurations.

00:20:56.020 --> 00:20:59.200
For example different
Samsung Galaxy 7s.

00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:01.210
We've heard multiple
times from developers

00:21:01.210 --> 00:21:02.800
that it's very
hard to figure out

00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:05.020
what's happening to those
cases, and especially

00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:07.210
to debug performance issues.

00:21:07.210 --> 00:21:10.930
So in our new catalog, we group
all those devices for you,

00:21:10.930 --> 00:21:13.990
while allowing you to drill down
and see each individual device

00:21:13.990 --> 00:21:15.220
SKU separately.

00:21:15.220 --> 00:21:16.990
If you want to
exclude a device, you

00:21:16.990 --> 00:21:20.020
can either exclude a
specific SKU or an entire set

00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:23.770
of devices for a single group.

00:21:23.770 --> 00:21:26.080
Now, one big addition
we're introducing

00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:28.680
are device exclusion rules.

00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:31.060
This is the ability to
exclude devices based

00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:33.160
on performance indicators.

00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:35.650
For example, if you're
developing a rich graphics

00:21:35.650 --> 00:21:38.500
game, you may struggle
to get it to perform well

00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:42.250
on devices with less than
512meg or 1 gig of RAM.

00:21:42.250 --> 00:21:45.160
In which case, you
may want to exclude

00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:48.100
the entire group of devices
with less RAM than that.

00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:50.680
Or if you discover
a specific bug,

00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:53.800
you may decide to exclude all
devices with a specific system

00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:55.870
on a chip configuration.

00:21:55.870 --> 00:21:58.390
This allows you to
stop deployment only

00:21:58.390 --> 00:22:01.180
to problematic devices
while you work on a fix,

00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:03.640
and deploy the fix to
all the affected users

00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:06.270
as soon as it gets ready.

00:22:06.270 --> 00:22:09.100
When you create an exclusion
rule, we also, similar to what

00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:11.790
Kobi was earlier
saying, we show you

00:22:11.790 --> 00:22:13.650
which devices you're
about to exclude,

00:22:13.650 --> 00:22:15.990
how much installs you're
making from all those devices,

00:22:15.990 --> 00:22:17.480
and how much revenue
you're making.

00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:19.110
Which is pretty
important information

00:22:19.110 --> 00:22:21.750
where you're making a
big decision like this.

00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:23.490
And then to save
you some more time,

00:22:23.490 --> 00:22:26.040
we also let you copy the
list of excluded devices

00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:28.640
from another one of
your apps, just to make

00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:29.640
it a little bit quicker.

00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:31.920
KOBI GLICK: We already heard
from a bunch of developers

00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:33.090
that they really
love this feature.

00:22:33.090 --> 00:22:34.048
SARAH THOMSON: Oh yeah?

00:22:34.048 --> 00:22:36.060
MILENA NIKOLIC: Cool.

00:22:36.060 --> 00:22:39.090
So we know you want to exclude
a few devices as possible.

00:22:39.090 --> 00:22:43.500
After all, Android is so great
because it has a vast reach,

00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:45.630
and because users
everywhere around the world

00:22:45.630 --> 00:22:48.690
are using a great and
diverse device set.

00:22:48.690 --> 00:22:50.970
However, we do acknowledge
that sometimes, you

00:22:50.970 --> 00:22:53.070
need to exclude
devices temporarily

00:22:53.070 --> 00:22:54.430
or even permanently.

00:22:54.430 --> 00:22:57.510
And we want to make sure we have
the right feature set allowing

00:22:57.510 --> 00:22:59.860
you to make such
important decisions,

00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:02.760
including validations to make
sure you don't shoot yourself

00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:05.490
in the foot by over-exploding.

00:23:05.490 --> 00:23:07.230
You can see, for
example, that EA

00:23:07.230 --> 00:23:10.350
are using new tools to launch
more confidently and ensure

00:23:10.350 --> 00:23:12.640
players get better
experiences across all

00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:13.765
of their supported devices.

00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:20.420
Similarly, Space Ape Games
shared feedback with us

00:23:20.420 --> 00:23:23.330
where they found a great
way of incorporating

00:23:23.330 --> 00:23:28.884
new device targeting tools to
reduce costs and improve API.

00:23:28.884 --> 00:23:31.390
SARAH THOMSON: So I'd like
to build a little bit off

00:23:31.390 --> 00:23:34.360
of what Milena was just
speaking to there around device

00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:35.560
exclusion.

00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:37.930
So Big Fish, one of
our testing partners

00:23:37.930 --> 00:23:40.330
for the device catalog,
has been really

00:23:40.330 --> 00:23:43.120
terrific in sharing a ton
of feedback and insight

00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:45.850
into the tool as
they've been using it.

00:23:45.850 --> 00:23:48.460
We collated their
experience into a case study

00:23:48.460 --> 00:23:50.780
that we're going to
share with you today.

00:23:50.780 --> 00:23:52.930
But first, I wanted to
take a little bit of a step

00:23:52.930 --> 00:23:56.800
back and let you know that
we had some reservations

00:23:56.800 --> 00:23:59.680
as a platform, as Google
Play, that we were

00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:03.040
a little bit concerned that
developers might support less

00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:05.470
devices as a result of this.

00:24:05.470 --> 00:24:08.230
But Big Fish illustrates
that this is, in fact, going

00:24:08.230 --> 00:24:09.880
to facilitate the opposite.

00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:13.310
It's going to allow you
to support more devices.

00:24:13.310 --> 00:24:15.790
So as we went down that
rabbit hole with them

00:24:15.790 --> 00:24:18.790
with their first days of
interacting with the catalog,

00:24:18.790 --> 00:24:20.890
two recurring themes popped up.

00:24:20.890 --> 00:24:22.080
Precision and quality.

00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:26.620
Let's start with precision.

00:24:26.620 --> 00:24:29.200
So Big Fish's mantra is
actually to publish games

00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:32.830
to the widest audience
possible, and using restrictions

00:24:32.830 --> 00:24:34.490
as a last resort.

00:24:34.490 --> 00:24:37.660
But my favorite quote from
them is right here, which is,

00:24:37.660 --> 00:24:40.660
"We can now take a
scalpel into the operating

00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:41.850
room instead of a hatchet."

00:24:41.850 --> 00:24:43.840
KOBI GLICK: It
sounds safer to me.

00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:46.360
SARAH THOMSON: It's
like, what a visual.

00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:48.280
As I'm sure many
of you can relate,

00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:51.100
developers have been
going to the far reaches

00:24:51.100 --> 00:24:54.910
of the Internet, scattered
across to leverage

00:24:54.910 --> 00:24:58.060
several third-party
sources of information

00:24:58.060 --> 00:25:02.050
around Android devices
and their specs for years.

00:25:02.050 --> 00:25:05.560
The Big Fish team really loves
the consolidated Android device

00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:08.530
models and grouping,
where they can also see,

00:25:08.530 --> 00:25:13.060
as Kobi was speaking about,
that install revenue and ratings

00:25:13.060 --> 00:25:15.560
numbers for each device.

00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:17.920
This allows you to make
more informed decisions.

00:25:20.430 --> 00:25:22.070
So one specific
example that they

00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:24.710
gave us was that, in the
past, they had this running

00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:27.650
list of low-end device
exclusions, probably

00:25:27.650 --> 00:25:31.430
sounds familiar, for a
particular business unit.

00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:33.470
They were forced
to search and check

00:25:33.470 --> 00:25:37.070
against this running
list for every new title.

00:25:37.070 --> 00:25:41.900
And given that Big Fish is an
extremely prolific game maker,

00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:44.460
this was a huge
pain in the butt.

00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:48.110
So they can now set that
one-time RAM-based device

00:25:48.110 --> 00:25:52.260
inclusion rule, and import
that into every new game,

00:25:52.260 --> 00:25:53.780
they launch moving forward.

00:25:53.780 --> 00:25:58.400
That means no running internal
lists, no manual labor.

00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:00.830
So this newly-found
precision is leading

00:26:00.830 --> 00:26:03.530
to some serious
efficiencies for them.

00:26:03.530 --> 00:26:06.110
And we're excited to provide
you with a lot of oil

00:26:06.110 --> 00:26:09.768
to grease those
wheels for your team.

00:26:09.768 --> 00:26:11.920
KOBI GLICK: We
actually asked Big Fish

00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:15.250
how they anticipated the
new catalog will help

00:26:15.250 --> 00:26:17.500
them to include more devices.

00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:19.570
So they give us a real example.

00:26:19.570 --> 00:26:22.120
In one very tricky
device group, they

00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:24.550
had to use the hatchet
approach that Sarah

00:26:24.550 --> 00:26:27.550
mentioned before,
and exclude 12%

00:26:27.550 --> 00:26:29.410
of the devices in that group.

00:26:29.410 --> 00:26:31.390
With the new catalog,
they estimate

00:26:31.390 --> 00:26:35.120
they can take down
this 12% to 2%,

00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:38.200
which means including
many more devices.

00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:43.230
This is a huge win for
both developers and users.

00:26:43.230 --> 00:26:45.790
SARAH THOMSON: So let's
move on to quality now.

00:26:45.790 --> 00:26:48.520
Since quality is near
and dear to our hearts

00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:51.130
here at Google Play, we
knew that giving you guys

00:26:51.130 --> 00:26:54.370
a significant and
centralized device catalog

00:26:54.370 --> 00:26:56.950
would surely lead
to improved quality.

00:26:56.950 --> 00:27:01.250
In particular, the catalog can
empower you, the developer,

00:27:01.250 --> 00:27:03.820
to create a consistent
and elevated user

00:27:03.820 --> 00:27:07.600
experience for Google Play
users across a broad array

00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:09.190
of devices.

00:27:09.190 --> 00:27:13.210
The diversity of Android devices
enables your games and apps

00:27:13.210 --> 00:27:17.110
to reach audiences that no
other gaming platform can do.

00:27:17.110 --> 00:27:20.560
We know that this also, though,
presents some unique challenges

00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:22.675
related to that diversity.

00:27:22.675 --> 00:27:24.750
MILENA NIKOLIC: I think
Big Fish said it best.

00:27:24.750 --> 00:27:27.020
We're able to be more
proactive in our device

00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:30.160
support of new launches, and
more quickly able to respond

00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:33.355
to real-world problems.

00:27:33.355 --> 00:27:36.330
SARAH THOMSON: The Big Fish team
gave me this pointed feedback

00:27:36.330 --> 00:27:39.060
of how the device
catalog is enabling

00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:42.900
them to react and solve
device-specific issues

00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:44.640
in record time.

00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:48.150
It's given them more confidence
in their early game rollout

00:27:48.150 --> 00:27:51.420
process, knowing that
they can iterate quickly

00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:54.490
against device support as well.

00:27:54.490 --> 00:27:57.300
So for example, they have
a game, Cooking Craze,

00:27:57.300 --> 00:28:00.150
that is currently in
open beta right now.

00:28:00.150 --> 00:28:03.570
They decided to launch it with
actually known performance

00:28:03.570 --> 00:28:07.350
issues, because they knew that,
while it was out in the wild,

00:28:07.350 --> 00:28:10.830
they could also look
for unforeseen issues.

00:28:10.830 --> 00:28:14.250
With launching earlier, and that
review feedback not counting

00:28:14.250 --> 00:28:17.340
towards their overall ratings
that I spoke of earlier,

00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:21.330
they could pluck out those
iffy devices and disable

00:28:21.330 --> 00:28:24.300
support for those
devices in the meantime.

00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:27.720
That then allows them to iterate
regarding device support more

00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:28.830
quickly.

00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:31.260
Then they were able
to insulate their game

00:28:31.260 --> 00:28:33.900
from negative reviews.

00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:38.010
And that would, in turn, not
affect the discovery algorithms

00:28:38.010 --> 00:28:38.982
on Google Play.

00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:43.710
So this is a really
amazing way for them

00:28:43.710 --> 00:28:47.370
to set themselves up for the
best possible global launch

00:28:47.370 --> 00:28:48.900
right out of the gate.

00:28:48.900 --> 00:28:54.360
And we understand that you
only get one chance at launch.

00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:58.590
While you guys are increasingly
focused on creating gaming

00:28:58.590 --> 00:29:01.680
experience with
lasting power beyond,

00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:05.100
we understand that that launch
window is still really crucial.

00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:09.030
It's the foundation that sets
your game up for success.

00:29:09.030 --> 00:29:11.520
Since the early days
of the device catalog,

00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:13.440
we're excited to hear
of other new ways

00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:15.570
that this service
will positively

00:29:15.570 --> 00:29:17.910
impact your apps and games.

00:29:17.910 --> 00:29:20.070
As we roll out more
broadly, please do

00:29:20.070 --> 00:29:21.810
share your stories with us.

00:29:21.810 --> 00:29:25.080
We'd love to understand how the
device catalog is contributing

00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:27.690
to the success of your game
and your business overall.

00:29:30.624 --> 00:29:32.590
KOBI GLICK: So it's
great to see how

00:29:32.590 --> 00:29:35.410
open beta, where we
opened the talk with,

00:29:35.410 --> 00:29:38.250
connects to the device catalog.

00:29:38.250 --> 00:29:41.190
Today, we've shown you
a bunch of new launches,

00:29:41.190 --> 00:29:43.550
new tools we're launching
in the Play Console.

00:29:43.550 --> 00:29:45.990
And we also showed you
how developers use them

00:29:45.990 --> 00:29:48.330
to find success on Google Play.

00:29:48.330 --> 00:29:50.430
We showed you our
new release flow,

00:29:50.430 --> 00:29:54.330
giving you more confidence and
clarity as you make up updates.

00:29:54.330 --> 00:29:56.310
We showed you the
new validation step,

00:29:56.310 --> 00:29:57.900
which makes sure
you avoid making

00:29:57.900 --> 00:30:00.690
major mistakes before
you release your app

00:30:00.690 --> 00:30:02.430
updates to users.

00:30:02.430 --> 00:30:05.610
We showed you how we made
staged rollout front and center,

00:30:05.610 --> 00:30:08.430
allowing you to see the
number of targeted devices

00:30:08.430 --> 00:30:11.100
and set custom percentages.

00:30:11.100 --> 00:30:13.470
We showed you how you can
save your release as a draft,

00:30:13.470 --> 00:30:16.690
and then come back later to
launch it when you're ready.

00:30:16.690 --> 00:30:18.730
We also showed you the
new Release Dashboard,

00:30:18.730 --> 00:30:21.520
allowing you to keep track
of your release performance

00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:23.590
in real time, making
sure you react

00:30:23.590 --> 00:30:25.840
to issues as they show up.

00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:28.480
And then we've also mentioned
that, starting today, you

00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:31.090
can publish your Android
Instant Apps directly

00:30:31.090 --> 00:30:33.752
from the Play Console.

00:30:33.752 --> 00:30:35.480
MILENA NIKOLIC: We
continued by talking

00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:38.000
about a new program
where Google Play can

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:41.030
take the burden of
signing your app from you.

00:30:41.030 --> 00:30:43.580
We talked about the security
benefits and about the size

00:30:43.580 --> 00:30:47.240
gains you can get with
the app optimizations.

00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:50.650
Last, but not least, we talked
about the new device catalog.

00:30:50.650 --> 00:30:53.750
We showed you the rich device
spec, how we group devices,

00:30:53.750 --> 00:30:57.240
how we can efficiently search
and filter the catalog,

00:30:57.240 --> 00:31:00.140
and how you can see the data
about performance of your app

00:31:00.140 --> 00:31:01.690
on a resulting set.

00:31:01.690 --> 00:31:03.890
We also talked about
the new rules allowing

00:31:03.890 --> 00:31:07.160
you to filter your
app on the store,

00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:10.670
based on performance indicators.

00:31:10.670 --> 00:31:12.350
And here are some
helpful links if you

00:31:12.350 --> 00:31:14.510
want to explore any of
the things we talked about

00:31:14.510 --> 00:31:15.980
in more detail.

00:31:15.980 --> 00:31:18.350
We are sure you will
like the new features.

00:31:18.350 --> 00:31:21.260
And they will help you
release with more confidence,

00:31:21.260 --> 00:31:23.930
better understand the
Android device base,

00:31:23.930 --> 00:31:26.420
and focus on doing
what you guys do best.

00:31:26.420 --> 00:31:29.750
Build amazing apps and games,
and deliver great experiences

00:31:29.750 --> 00:31:32.640
to millions of Android
users all around the world.

00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:33.140
Thank you

00:31:33.140 --> 00:31:34.514
SARAH THOMSON:
Thanks, everybody.

00:31:34.514 --> 00:31:37.190
