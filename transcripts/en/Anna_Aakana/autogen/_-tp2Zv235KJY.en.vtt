00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.880
I hate putting my foot in my mouth, and it happens a lot.

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:08.700
I remember when I was in middle school getting ready for a dance competition, with a bunch of friends.

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:13.620
One of my friends emerged from the bathroom having plucked her eyebrows, and she asked...

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:14.489
[Eyebrow Anna]: How do they look?

00:00:14.489 --> 00:00:19.060
[Left and Right Annas]: OMG, they look great.
[Middle Anna]: You look the same...

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:26.700
[Middle Anna]: What? I mean she doesn't have hairy eyebrows. Not saying she doesn't look good, I'm just saying it I can't really see a difference.

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.980
[Middle Anna]: I mean... Sorry.

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.680
Now what I think about it, I've had a very similar thing happen in high school as well.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:33.920
[Sad Anna] "So what are you gonna wear?"

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.120
[Foot in Mouth Anna]: Oh, I'm gonna be wearing this dress.
[Sad Anna]: Oh my god. That's so cute.

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.580
[FiM Anna]: Thank you. What are you wearing?

00:00:38.588 --> 00:00:39.808
[Sad Anna]: Oh? I'm just gonna wear this.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.340
[FiM Anna]: Oh, oh great.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.940
[Sad Anna]: Wow okay.
[FiM Anna]: No, I didn't mean like that.

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.489
[FiM Anna]: I was just like: oh my god, am I overdressed now, because you're so casual. But not like casual casual.

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.369
[FiM Anna]: I mean you look really pretty, it a really cute jumpsuit. I just um...

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:56.140
[FiM Anna]: I'm gonna go. I'm gonna go.

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:57.840
And even recently...

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.909
[FiM Anna]: Oh hey. Did you go to the dentist?
[Sad Anna]: Oh um.

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:03.959
[Sad Anna]: No, sorry, I I know that I need to.
[FiM Anna]: Oh no I didn't mean it like that.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.500
[FiM Anna]: Just like last time we talked you said you were gonna make an appointment and so I was kind of just like following up...

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.290
For some reason, I just say stuff.

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:16.520
And I don't realize how it can be taken as offensive until I've already offended the person.

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:23.680
And it's like my intentions are never bad. You know, I'm not trying to be passive-aggressive. When I'm mad at you, I am very straight up about it.

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:25.420
[Random Anna]: Hey Dude

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.000
[Brutally hateful Anna]: Hi, I hate you and I never want to see you again.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.170
[Random Anna]: What, why?
[Brutally hateful Anna]: I put a hex on you and your family.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.040
[Random Anna]: Oh my god, my family, my wife and children.

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:41.720
I'm kind of torn between wondering if this is just a part of who I am and if I should just accept it,

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.620
or striving to really pay attention to my words and see if they can be misconstrued,

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:50.440
or if there's a more sensitive way of saying things. Because, on one hand, if you're my friend...

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.440
I would hope that you would give me the benefit of the doubt. And know that I'm not trying to be an asshole,

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.880
and give me a chance to explain myself. But on the other hand, if I'm your friend,

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.229
I know that I should really try not to hurt your feelings. But what about you?

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:06.169
Do you have a friend who's kind of like this, who always puts their foot in their mouth?

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.899
Or is this you? And if you have a friend like this...

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:14.389
Are you cool with them or am I just doomed? I'm Anna Akana if you have a foot fetish...

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.940
