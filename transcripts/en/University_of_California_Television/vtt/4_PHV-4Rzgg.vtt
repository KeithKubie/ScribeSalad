00:00:05.561 --> 00:00:08.644
(gentle piano music)

00:00:09.673 --> 00:00:12.610
- [Narrator] We are the paradoxical ape.

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:15.110
Bipedal, naked, large-brained.

00:00:17.392 --> 00:00:21.282
Long the master of fire,
tools, and language

00:00:21.282 --> 00:00:24.699
but still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:26.171 --> 00:00:30.338
Aware that death is inevitable,
yet filled with optimism.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.127
We grow up slowly.

00:00:35.127 --> 00:00:37.699
We hand down knowledge.

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:39.782
We empathize and deceive.

00:00:41.189 --> 00:00:42.327
We shape the future from our

00:00:42.327 --> 00:00:45.077
shared understanding of the past.

00:00:46.623 --> 00:00:50.008
Carta brings together experts
from diverse disciplines

00:00:50.008 --> 00:00:53.088
to exchange insights on who we are

00:00:53.088 --> 00:00:54.755
and how we got here.

00:00:56.469 --> 00:00:58.248
An exploration made possible

00:00:58.248 --> 00:01:01.331
by the generosity of humans like you.

00:01:34.664 --> 00:01:39.183
- There's a long history
of writing about savants

00:01:39.183 --> 00:01:42.957
who emerge in childhood
and I'm gonna talk about

00:01:42.957 --> 00:01:45.016
a slightly different syndrome.

00:01:45.016 --> 00:01:47.575
My friend Allan Snyder
in Australia suggests

00:01:47.575 --> 00:01:50.688
that this be called acquired savantism,

00:01:50.688 --> 00:01:53.860
and so these are people who
did not have artistic abilities

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.513
or talents who in the setting
of neurodegenerative diseases

00:01:57.513 --> 00:02:01.437
have acquired new artistic
abilities and this is

00:02:01.437 --> 00:02:03.736
the group that I lead in San Francisco

00:02:03.736 --> 00:02:07.003
and almost everybody in that audience

00:02:07.003 --> 00:02:11.015
has helped me in some way in this work.

00:02:11.015 --> 00:02:14.539
So we know a lot about art and the brain

00:02:14.539 --> 00:02:17.789
from lesions whether it's brain tumors,

00:02:18.737 --> 00:02:21.836
strokes, brain trauma and there

00:02:21.836 --> 00:02:24.579
are certain themes that have emerged.

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:28.623
One is that the right
posterior parts of the brain,

00:02:28.623 --> 00:02:30.859
parietal lobe in particular

00:02:30.859 --> 00:02:32.914
are essential for the ability to copy

00:02:32.914 --> 00:02:36.210
and probably along with
the right temporal lobe

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:40.377
conjure up images that we want
to put on a piece of paper.

00:02:42.052 --> 00:02:45.176
The smallest lesion in that brain area

00:02:45.176 --> 00:02:48.093
will devastate the ability to copy.

00:02:49.448 --> 00:02:53.615
Not as bad as Dan's artwork,
but along that spectrum.

00:02:54.472 --> 00:02:55.845
Yeah, okay.

00:02:55.845 --> 00:02:58.273
So less, little bit less known

00:02:58.273 --> 00:02:59.795
I'm gonna touch on this today

00:02:59.795 --> 00:03:02.241
about the left side of the brain,

00:03:02.241 --> 00:03:06.904
but in general the senses
that symbolic, linguistic,

00:03:06.904 --> 00:03:09.916
conceptual aspects of art are associated

00:03:09.916 --> 00:03:13.999
with left hemisphere and
with injury to that part

00:03:15.814 --> 00:03:18.199
of the brain there is a
theme in the literature

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:21.449
of preservation of the ability to copy.

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.674
I began to study this not
'cause I thought about it

00:03:27.674 --> 00:03:32.634
because it sort of ran into
me in the study of patients

00:03:32.634 --> 00:03:34.923
that I've seen with
neurodegenerative disease

00:03:34.923 --> 00:03:39.165
and I was taught going into my fellowship

00:03:39.165 --> 00:03:42.963
that degenerative diseases
hit the brain diffusely.

00:03:42.963 --> 00:03:45.018
You could learn nothing
about the functions

00:03:45.018 --> 00:03:48.680
of the brain from studying
neurodegenerative diseases,

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.238
but I think we've known
really since the time of Pick

00:03:52.238 --> 00:03:55.038
and Alzheimer that we have two major

00:03:55.038 --> 00:03:58.818
pre-senile neurodegenerative conditions.

00:03:58.818 --> 00:04:01.606
One that affects the
front part of the brain,

00:04:01.606 --> 00:04:05.250
often begins in the frontal insular

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:08.178
and sometimes anterior temporal lobes.

00:04:08.178 --> 00:04:10.242
That's shown in blue.

00:04:10.242 --> 00:04:11.981
These are disorders that are called

00:04:11.981 --> 00:04:14.076
frontotemporal dementias.

00:04:14.076 --> 00:04:17.409
They have a lack of Alzheimer pathology.

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:22.006
No plaques or tangles,
and then Alzheimer's

00:04:22.006 --> 00:04:25.394
usually a posteriorly predominant disease

00:04:25.394 --> 00:04:29.279
that affects the hippocampus
so very different anatomy

00:04:29.279 --> 00:04:32.343
and very different sorts of syndromes

00:04:32.343 --> 00:04:35.510
that we see in the setting of these two

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:38.620
distinctive neurodegenerative conditions.

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:40.205
There's been a lot written

00:04:40.205 --> 00:04:42.527
about art and Alzheimer's disease.

00:04:42.527 --> 00:04:45.398
I think many people get
quite a bit of pleasure

00:04:45.398 --> 00:04:49.565
working in with art therapists
and with Alzheimer's disease

00:04:50.981 --> 00:04:53.839
and you know I think what
these disorders tell you

00:04:53.839 --> 00:04:57.338
is your art is influenced
by the part of the brain

00:04:57.338 --> 00:05:01.289
that is injured, so
because Alzheimer's disease

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:05.298
hits the posterior
temporal parietal regions

00:05:05.298 --> 00:05:07.514
sometimes worse on the
right than the left,

00:05:07.514 --> 00:05:09.923
sometimes the left worse than the right,

00:05:09.923 --> 00:05:11.506
you lose precision.

00:05:12.792 --> 00:05:16.082
There tends to be visuospatial difficulty,

00:05:16.082 --> 00:05:18.126
but some things remain.

00:05:18.126 --> 00:05:22.411
The ability to perceive
color, simple shapes.

00:05:22.411 --> 00:05:27.216
This is one of my patient's
paintings, Megan Fox.

00:05:27.216 --> 00:05:29.179
I think quite a beautiful piece

00:05:29.179 --> 00:05:31.668
and a very nice use of color.

00:05:31.668 --> 00:05:33.845
I think very typical of what we see

00:05:33.845 --> 00:05:36.473
in the setting of Alzheimer's disease

00:05:36.473 --> 00:05:40.753
and of course fine
artists like de Kooning,

00:05:40.753 --> 00:05:44.835
William Utermohlen were
profoundly disrupted

00:05:44.835 --> 00:05:49.002
in their ability to produce
images of complex faces,

00:05:50.476 --> 00:05:52.809
complex shape, and were left

00:05:53.696 --> 00:05:57.113
with very simple, simple forms like this.

00:05:58.033 --> 00:06:00.434
In frontotemporal dementia,
there's a different

00:06:00.434 --> 00:06:05.206
sort of story and this is
a paper we wrote in 1998

00:06:05.206 --> 00:06:09.226
focused on the emergence
of new artistic skills

00:06:09.226 --> 00:06:11.815
after the disease onset.

00:06:11.815 --> 00:06:15.660
The theme was that visual
creativity was more common

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:18.744
when the anterior temporal lobes,

00:06:18.744 --> 00:06:20.911
or the left frontal lobe was

00:06:20.911 --> 00:06:23.699
where the focal degeneration began.

00:06:23.699 --> 00:06:27.148
These are often called
primary progressive aphasias

00:06:27.148 --> 00:06:29.276
because they affect language,

00:06:29.276 --> 00:06:31.721
but remarkably in some individuals

00:06:31.721 --> 00:06:35.016
we see an emergence of visual creativity.

00:06:35.016 --> 00:06:37.863
Wrote about that in 1998.

00:06:37.863 --> 00:06:40.733
Didn't understand the mechanism very well.

00:06:40.733 --> 00:06:43.899
Starting to understand the
circuitry that we think

00:06:43.899 --> 00:06:47.875
emerges in the setting
of this loss of function

00:06:47.875 --> 00:06:50.804
in the dominant hemisphere.

00:06:50.804 --> 00:06:53.647
So this was a patient, Jack,

00:06:53.647 --> 00:06:55.750
that got me interested in this story.

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:58.144
He was a banker, he
lived in Santa Barbara.

00:06:58.144 --> 00:07:01.026
They did a special on him on ABC News

00:07:01.026 --> 00:07:05.059
and Jack had never had the
slightest interest in art.

00:07:05.059 --> 00:07:08.042
In the 1980s his wife
died, he became depressed,

00:07:08.042 --> 00:07:10.428
he started working with an art therapist

00:07:10.428 --> 00:07:12.178
and started painting.

00:07:13.193 --> 00:07:17.156
What I learned about Jack
is he painted repetitively.

00:07:17.156 --> 00:07:21.323
He did many of the pictures
that I saw over and over again.

00:07:22.219 --> 00:07:25.833
This compulsive need to paint I think

00:07:25.833 --> 00:07:27.679
was one of the reasons that his painting

00:07:27.679 --> 00:07:30.963
was so interesting and successful.

00:07:30.963 --> 00:07:33.717
This is I think one of his masterpieces.

00:07:33.717 --> 00:07:37.884
When I saw him around 1995,
Jack was obsessed with painting.

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:42.937
Profoundly aphasic head loss,

00:07:43.977 --> 00:07:47.727
many of the words particularly nouns.

00:07:47.727 --> 00:07:52.097
He drew this parrot that
he remembered from Hawaii

00:07:52.097 --> 00:07:55.922
yet couldn't tell me
what this painting was.

00:07:55.922 --> 00:07:58.673
Obsessed with the colors
purple and yellow.

00:07:58.673 --> 00:08:01.700
Like many of these
patients, completely unable

00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:06.614
to get him to describe the art
of creating or why he did it.

00:08:06.614 --> 00:08:11.007
The phrases I heard
over and over again was

00:08:11.007 --> 00:08:13.403
yellow and purple wave over me.

00:08:13.403 --> 00:08:16.697
So he became obsessed with painting.

00:08:16.697 --> 00:08:18.748
He painted purple things and yellow things

00:08:18.748 --> 00:08:21.503
over and over again, progressively lost

00:08:21.503 --> 00:08:23.645
social skills and language.

00:08:23.645 --> 00:08:26.423
Visually profoundly preoccupied.

00:08:26.423 --> 00:08:29.097
Jack used to walk the
streets of Santa Barbara

00:08:29.097 --> 00:08:32.218
with his caretaker looking for coins.

00:08:32.218 --> 00:08:35.886
When I visited him in
Santa Barbara I was sitting

00:08:35.886 --> 00:08:39.169
at the table, immediately
he says it's raining.

00:08:39.169 --> 00:08:43.336
Now he had uncanny I think
ability to focus visually.

00:08:44.755 --> 00:08:48.248
So Jack produced this series of paintings.

00:08:48.248 --> 00:08:53.156
This is a slightly later one,
I think very Fauvist in style.

00:08:53.156 --> 00:08:56.261
You can see an interesting
strategy where the sail

00:08:56.261 --> 00:08:59.231
is both the background and the sail.

00:08:59.231 --> 00:09:02.423
Losing some of the precision that he had

00:09:02.423 --> 00:09:05.061
I think as the disease creeps into

00:09:05.061 --> 00:09:07.850
the parietal lobes more posteriorly.

00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:11.178
A slightly later piece where he is really

00:09:11.178 --> 00:09:14.555
losing the ability the
way an Alzheimer patient

00:09:14.555 --> 00:09:17.207
might paint precisely.

00:09:17.207 --> 00:09:21.366
Again that theme of purple
and yellow, Jack's obsession.

00:09:21.366 --> 00:09:24.131
And then finally one of the
last pieces he ever did.

00:09:24.131 --> 00:09:28.465
I think quite whimsical,
beautiful picture of a man.

00:09:28.465 --> 00:09:31.070
As he lost the ability to paint,

00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:34.754
this was replaced by the
compulsion to brush his teeth.

00:09:34.754 --> 00:09:37.224
He did this over and over again.

00:09:37.224 --> 00:09:40.807
And as we learned later, Jack had a form

00:09:40.807 --> 00:09:42.809
of frontotemporal dementia.

00:09:42.809 --> 00:09:44.310
A very interesting form that

00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:46.844
has been called semantic dementia,

00:09:46.844 --> 00:09:51.378
or semantic variant of
primary progressive aphasia.

00:09:51.378 --> 00:09:53.810
It's a subtype of frontotemporal dementia.

00:09:53.810 --> 00:09:56.451
It was what Pick described in 1892.

00:09:56.451 --> 00:10:00.922
It affects predominantly the
two anterior temporal lobes.

00:10:00.922 --> 00:10:02.559
One it affects the left side,

00:10:02.559 --> 00:10:05.579
which most of my artists
come from this group.

00:10:05.579 --> 00:10:08.668
You lose your knowledge about words.

00:10:08.668 --> 00:10:12.079
You lose your knowledge eventually

00:10:12.079 --> 00:10:14.796
about things in the world.

00:10:14.796 --> 00:10:16.709
Unlike Alzheimer's disease,

00:10:16.709 --> 00:10:19.714
the naming deficit
isn't improved by clues.

00:10:19.714 --> 00:10:22.831
They don't know what that word means.

00:10:22.831 --> 00:10:27.653
The anatomy is very focal, so
I think as these individuals

00:10:27.653 --> 00:10:31.820
lose function in the amygdala
anterior temporal lobes,

00:10:33.431 --> 00:10:36.901
orbital frontal cortex
there's disinhibition,

00:10:36.901 --> 00:10:39.059
progressive language disturbance,

00:10:39.059 --> 00:10:42.554
but often visuospatial
skills are profoundly spared.

00:10:42.554 --> 00:10:46.607
These are people whose only
point on a cognitive test

00:10:46.607 --> 00:10:49.884
is drawing a complex visual figure.

00:10:49.884 --> 00:10:52.203
So this is you know something

00:10:52.203 --> 00:10:54.477
that is often spared in these individuals

00:10:54.477 --> 00:10:58.089
and in a subgroup there
is a new emergence of

00:10:58.089 --> 00:11:02.722
interest in painting and
increased visual creativity.

00:11:02.722 --> 00:11:06.017
I always thought this was first
described by a neurologist

00:11:06.017 --> 00:11:09.100
but on a trip to Colombia around 2006

00:11:10.819 --> 00:11:13.249
I was reading 100 Years of Solitude

00:11:13.249 --> 00:11:18.237
by Gabriel Garcia Marquez and
I came across his description,

00:11:18.237 --> 00:11:20.382
the first description of

00:11:20.382 --> 00:11:23.738
semantic dementia I
think in the literature.

00:11:23.738 --> 00:11:25.910
It's the town of Macondo, people are dying

00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:29.022
of a sleeping sickness and he describes

00:11:29.022 --> 00:11:30.772
what happens to them.

00:11:31.671 --> 00:11:32.848
"He discovered he had trouble

00:11:32.848 --> 00:11:35.553
"remembering every
object in the laboratory.

00:11:35.553 --> 00:11:37.982
"He didn't know what they were.

00:11:37.982 --> 00:11:39.734
"He marked them with
their respective names

00:11:39.734 --> 00:11:42.298
"so that all he had to do
was read the inscription

00:11:42.298 --> 00:11:44.786
"in order to identify them.

00:11:44.786 --> 00:11:45.880
"This is the cow.

00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:47.273
"She must be milked every morning

00:11:47.273 --> 00:11:49.201
"so that she will produce milk

00:11:49.201 --> 00:11:50.431
"and the milk must be boiled

00:11:50.431 --> 00:11:54.075
"in order to be mixed with coffee."

00:11:54.075 --> 00:11:56.830
Gorgeous description, "they
went on living in a reality

00:11:56.830 --> 00:11:59.535
"that was slipping away,
momentarily captured

00:11:59.535 --> 00:12:03.085
"by words but which
would escape irremediably

00:12:03.085 --> 00:12:06.234
"when they forgot the
values of written letters."

00:12:06.234 --> 00:12:10.064
So around the time that
I discovered this piece

00:12:10.064 --> 00:12:11.916
from Gabriel Garcia Marquez,

00:12:11.916 --> 00:12:16.083
we had a patient very much
like the villager in Macondo.

00:12:17.584 --> 00:12:19.410
So this is my patient Bob,

00:12:19.410 --> 00:12:20.949
who like many of these individuals

00:12:20.949 --> 00:12:22.797
know that they're losing words,

00:12:22.797 --> 00:12:24.664
know that they're losing knowledge

00:12:24.664 --> 00:12:27.102
about facts in their world

00:12:27.102 --> 00:12:31.269
and you can see here just like
Garcia Marquez's description,

00:12:33.197 --> 00:12:36.727
he's putting down these
names, these words.

00:12:36.727 --> 00:12:40.894
Compulsively, repetitively,
fully catheter, endocarditis,

00:12:41.978 --> 00:12:44.858
he knows that his world is slipping away

00:12:44.858 --> 00:12:47.784
just in the way Gabriel
Garcia Marquez described it.

00:12:47.784 --> 00:12:49.907
I don't think, and be glad to talk

00:12:49.907 --> 00:12:52.960
about this with anyone online, offline

00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:56.639
that Marquez actually saw a
case of semantic dementia.

00:12:56.639 --> 00:12:59.286
I think he was writing
about his own writer's block

00:12:59.286 --> 00:13:03.041
and I think this is what he
conceptualized at the time.

00:13:03.041 --> 00:13:05.381
So we couldn't resist, this is Bob's

00:13:05.381 --> 00:13:08.898
who drew a cow quite beautifully.

00:13:08.898 --> 00:13:11.422
His elephant I think rather whimsical,

00:13:11.422 --> 00:13:14.382
certainly better than Dan and I could do

00:13:14.382 --> 00:13:16.671
I think in the copies, but yeah.

00:13:16.671 --> 00:13:19.859
So this is a degenerative disease.

00:13:19.859 --> 00:13:24.684
The concepts for these
animals often nouns first,

00:13:24.684 --> 00:13:27.716
verbs relatively spared, look like

00:13:27.716 --> 00:13:29.344
they come out of evolution.

00:13:29.344 --> 00:13:32.065
I appreciated that
picture of Darwin earlier.

00:13:32.065 --> 00:13:35.875
So the dog looks a little bit like a cat.

00:13:35.875 --> 00:13:39.285
It looks like some features of a cow,

00:13:39.285 --> 00:13:43.346
and similarly the cat
has features of the dog.

00:13:43.346 --> 00:13:46.996
The fish to me looks
very much like a penguin,

00:13:46.996 --> 00:13:50.463
but I think as you're
watching this patient

00:13:50.463 --> 00:13:54.983
with semantic dementia lose
their conceptual knowledge

00:13:54.983 --> 00:13:58.639
around what distinctive
animals really are.

00:13:58.639 --> 00:14:00.903
And of course if you don't
know what an animal is,

00:14:00.903 --> 00:14:03.694
you don't know what color to give it.

00:14:03.694 --> 00:14:06.219
So we asked this patient to draw the frog

00:14:06.219 --> 00:14:08.452
and put the color in.

00:14:08.452 --> 00:14:12.619
He drew a pink frog, not the
green one which he should.

00:14:14.696 --> 00:14:18.836
This is my latest favorite set of pieces.

00:14:18.836 --> 00:14:21.199
This is a gentleman who
we're going to describe

00:14:21.199 --> 00:14:23.301
for the Journal of JAMA.

00:14:23.301 --> 00:14:25.968
He became obsessed with welding.

00:14:27.817 --> 00:14:29.588
He was not an artist.

00:14:29.588 --> 00:14:33.790
This is his bird, and
you can see it has got

00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:36.790
that same quality of mixed metaphor.

00:14:38.402 --> 00:14:41.235
The bird has features of an insect

00:14:42.138 --> 00:14:45.320
and I think this really has taught me

00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:49.702
that what an artist does
is put down on a canvas

00:14:49.702 --> 00:14:52.869
the way that they see the world, okay.

00:14:53.705 --> 00:14:56.622
So just a couple conclusion points.

00:14:58.131 --> 00:15:02.025
Our poet laureate Kay
Ryan from Marin County

00:15:02.025 --> 00:15:05.286
has taught us at the UCSF about

00:15:05.286 --> 00:15:07.382
the neuroscientist Emily Dickinson

00:15:07.382 --> 00:15:10.603
and I think Emily Dickinson you know

00:15:10.603 --> 00:15:13.475
had a very modern way of
thinking about the brain.

00:15:13.475 --> 00:15:16.013
And so when I was thinking
about these patients

00:15:16.013 --> 00:15:18.143
I came across this poem by her

00:15:18.143 --> 00:15:22.236
and I think she was
interested in moral decay,

00:15:22.236 --> 00:15:24.231
but this is really the decay of

00:15:24.231 --> 00:15:28.779
neurodegenerative diseases
as we understand it in 2017.

00:15:28.779 --> 00:15:32.093
Crumbling, or the dementia,
is not an instant act

00:15:32.093 --> 00:15:36.834
and we now know probably 20
years before we see a patient

00:15:36.834 --> 00:15:38.535
with one of these diseases that

00:15:38.535 --> 00:15:41.066
the degenerative process has begun.

00:15:41.066 --> 00:15:43.272
"A fundamental pause, dilapidation's

00:15:43.272 --> 00:15:45.791
"processes are organized decays."

00:15:45.791 --> 00:15:49.235
Totally contradicts the idea the dementias

00:15:49.235 --> 00:15:51.010
hit the brain diffusely.

00:15:51.010 --> 00:15:54.815
These are organized decays
in very specific circuits.

00:15:54.815 --> 00:15:56.498
Other circuits are spared.

00:15:56.498 --> 00:15:58.561
"'Tis first a cobweb on the soul."

00:15:58.561 --> 00:16:00.069
This is the misfolded protein

00:16:00.069 --> 00:16:04.952
that Rusty Gage and Dan
Geschwind talk and write about.

00:16:04.952 --> 00:16:07.350
"Cuticle of dust a borer in the axis

00:16:07.350 --> 00:16:08.779
"an elemental rust.

00:16:08.779 --> 00:16:10.381
"Ruin is formal Devil's work

00:16:10.381 --> 00:16:12.464
"consecutive and slow.

00:16:12.464 --> 00:16:15.295
"Fail in an instant, no man did slipping"

00:16:15.295 --> 00:16:17.659
or the dementing process "is Crash's law."

00:16:17.659 --> 00:16:20.834
So we see the crash, but
I think what these artists

00:16:20.834 --> 00:16:23.503
have told me is that there is a period

00:16:23.503 --> 00:16:26.208
when this process is beginning

00:16:26.208 --> 00:16:28.111
where certain parts of the brain

00:16:28.111 --> 00:16:32.278
may be particularly immune
to the degenerative process.

00:16:36.017 --> 00:16:39.129
They are spared and
possibly begin to remodel

00:16:39.129 --> 00:16:42.684
and we've written a little bit about this

00:16:42.684 --> 00:16:45.550
describing an artist named Anne Adams.

00:16:45.550 --> 00:16:49.338
So the conclusion is
it's I think a beautiful

00:16:49.338 --> 00:16:51.598
but also a very sad story.

00:16:51.598 --> 00:16:53.013
Artistic creativity may emerge

00:16:53.013 --> 00:16:55.528
with left hemisphere dysfunction.

00:16:55.528 --> 00:16:58.785
I think we have some data
from the artist Anne Adams

00:16:58.785 --> 00:17:02.952
that there is rewiring of right
posterior parietal regions.

00:17:05.262 --> 00:17:10.183
Very area that Karen Burman
showed as probably dysfunctional

00:17:10.183 --> 00:17:13.055
in kids with Williams Syndrome.

00:17:13.055 --> 00:17:14.937
Insights into the degenerative process

00:17:14.937 --> 00:17:18.020
suggest that sometimes a new strength

00:17:19.562 --> 00:17:22.562
may herald the degenerative process,

00:17:23.598 --> 00:17:25.429
but I think understanding
people's strengths

00:17:25.429 --> 00:17:27.882
are critical for diagnosis and care

00:17:27.882 --> 00:17:31.893
and I think also this gives
us insight into our humanity

00:17:31.893 --> 00:17:33.793
and almost everyone has touched on this.

00:17:33.793 --> 00:17:36.960
Brain asymmetry is at the
core of our strengths,

00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:39.253
but also at the core of our weaknesses.

00:17:39.253 --> 00:17:40.590
So thank you.

00:17:40.590 --> 00:17:42.840
(applause)
