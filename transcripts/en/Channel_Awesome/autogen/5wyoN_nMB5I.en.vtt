00:19:11.830 --> 00:19:11.840 align:start position:0%
the way it's shot and fell okay yeah and
 

00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:15.100 align:start position:0%
the way it's shot and fell okay yeah and
I<00:19:11.990><c> mostly</c><00:19:12.320><c> this</c><00:19:12.559><c> the</c><00:19:12.830><c> the</c><00:19:13.100><c> pacing</c><00:19:13.640><c> of</c><00:19:13.820><c> it</c><00:19:14.110><c> this</c>

maybe cuz there was
there's<00:28:33.509><c> a</c><00:28:33.599><c> lot</c><00:28:33.749><c> CG</c><00:28:34.139><c> in</c><00:28:34.289><c> this</c><00:28:34.470><c> too</c><00:28:34.710><c> I</c><00:28:34.889><c> mean</c><00:28:35.070><c> I'll</c>

00:28:35.119 --> 00:28:35.129 align:start position:0%
there's a lot CG in this too I mean I'll
 

00:28:35.129 --> 00:28:36.859 align:start position:0%
there's a lot CG in this too I mean I'll
say<00:28:35.340><c> only</c><00:28:35.460><c> because</c><00:28:35.879><c> there</c><00:28:36.029><c> was</c><00:28:36.149><c> so</c><00:28:36.299><c> many</c><00:28:36.419><c> CG</c>

00:28:36.859 --> 00:28:36.869 align:start position:0%
say only because there was so many CG
 

00:28:36.869 --> 00:28:39.139 align:start position:0%
say only because there was so many CG
lands<00:28:37.109><c> on</c><00:28:37.559><c> this</c><00:28:37.710><c> like</c><00:28:38.009><c> if</c><00:28:38.399><c> you</c><00:28:38.580><c> want</c><00:28:38.820><c> if</c><00:28:38.999><c> you</c>
