actually take out part of the esophagus

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710
actually take out part of the esophagus
 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.209
actually take out part of the esophagus
and replace it with a bio scaffold and

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219
and replace it with a bio scaffold and
 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.360
and replace it with a bio scaffold and
seed that with stem cells so that it can

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370
seed that with stem cells so that it can
 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.000

regrow a new scaffold this has been

it's a matter of things that are outside

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590
it's a matter of things that are outside
 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.300
it's a matter of things that are outside
of science but we do hope that enabling

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310
of science but we do hope that enabling
 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.910

it in many labs for a point that

everybody can try it out will help this

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689
everybody can try it out will help this

everybody can try it out will help this
adoption happen quicker so five years is

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200
adoption happen quicker so five years is
 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.170

absolutely a technological reality we'll

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180
absolutely a technological reality we'll

absolutely a technological reality we'll
see if it's a political reality there

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180
see if it's a political reality there
 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.179
see if it's a political reality there
are of course political hurdles in doing

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189
are of course political hurdles in doing
 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.520
are of course political hurdles in doing
anything in medicine but there that is

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530
anything in medicine but there that is
 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.850
anything in medicine but there that is
also kind of an excuse for us when we

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860
also kind of an excuse for us when we
 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.219
also kind of an excuse for us when we
don't accomplish things as fast as we

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229
don't accomplish things as fast as we
 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.060
don't accomplish things as fast as we
would like to they are real but I think

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070
would like to they are real but I think
 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.700
would like to they are real but I think
the biggest hurdle in nanotechnology and

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710
the biggest hurdle in nanotechnology and
 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.069
the biggest hurdle in nanotechnology and
regenerative medicine specifically is

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079
regenerative medicine specifically is
 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.609
regenerative medicine specifically is
that the public doesn't know about it so

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619
that the public doesn't know about it so
 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.280
that the public doesn't know about it so
it's not on the radar of most people so

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290
it's not on the radar of most people so
 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.230
it's not on the radar of most people so
they're not excited about it they don't

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240
they're not excited about it they don't
 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.690
they're not excited about it they don't
push for it they don't spend money on it

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700
push for it they don't spend money on it
 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.100
push for it they don't spend money on it
they don't lobby for it they don't

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110
they don't lobby for it they don't
 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.289
they don't lobby for it they don't
realize that their lives and their

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299
realize that their lives and their
 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.600
realize that their lives and their
parents lives and the children's lives

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610
parents lives and the children's lives
 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.330
parents lives and the children's lives
could be saved by it it's always amazing

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340
could be saved by it it's always amazing
 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.770
could be saved by it it's always amazing
to me the

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780
to me the
 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.720
to me the
types of technology that get attention

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730
types of technology that get attention
 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.930
types of technology that get attention
while others that are truly

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940
while others that are truly
 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.650
while others that are truly
world-changing don't get any attention

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660
world-changing don't get any attention
 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.170
world-changing don't get any attention
at all regenerative medicine is a good

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180
at all regenerative medicine is a good
 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.720
at all regenerative medicine is a good
example of that
