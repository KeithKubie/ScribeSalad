00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:05.290
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:26.240
[silence]

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:27.540
&gt;&gt; ROSWELL ENCINA:
Yep, it's a library.

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:31.570
Shh. Good morning, everyone.

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:33.410
We're so honored to have
everyone here today.

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.700
I'm Roswell Encina, the
Chief Communications Officer

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.450 position:56%
for the Library of Congress, and on
behalf of the Librarian of Congress,

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.930
Dr. Carla Hayden, she welcomes
everyone here this morning.

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.050
We're excited to see
everyone here today.

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:51.310
Now today's program is in
remembrance of Jonah Eskin.

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:54.580
His parents Marcia and
Barney keep his memory alive

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:56.640
by supporting the Young Readers
Center here at the library

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.750
and by supporting programs
like this this morning.

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.580
We would like to spotlight
Marcia and Barney

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:03.880
who are here this morning.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:07.400
We would love them to stand and be
acknowledged by this amazing crowd.

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:19.330
Once again, their generosity has
allowed us to do programs like this

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.130
and do all the wonderful
programs that we do

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:22.940
at the Young Readers Center.

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:25.650
Also, by the way, this week
is Children's Book Week.

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.590
That's one thing we
could probably agree on,

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.320
that books brighten the day,
it's like the light of the room.

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.710
When I was a kid, all those Dr.
Seuss books were my favorites,

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:38.820
then when I became a teenager,
it's going to show my age,

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.620
but I loved those Hardy Boys books.

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:44.030
Nowadays, there's a lot
of books to choose from,

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.350
especially for young adults.

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.330
There's the John Green books, the
Neil Gaiman books, I could go on

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.950
and on, but you're very
lucky with the selection

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:55.690
of books that you have nowadays.

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.200
We're very also lucky to have a
wonderful group of students here

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.910
from the district, and when
I call out your school,

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:06.860 position:56%
you have to show some love for your
school and make a major cheer, okay?

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.930
It's up to you.

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:15.130 position:56%
First, the Thurgood Marshall School.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:29.830
[applause] There was
a slight pause there.

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.460
I thought they weren't here.

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:34.760
All right, all right.

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:47.490
The School Without Walls
at Francis Stevens.

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:50.650
[applause] I think I
created something there.

00:02:50.650 --> 00:03:01.920
I know we're going to
try to one-up each other.

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:07.480
The Langley School.

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.980
[applause] The Lowell School.

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.530
All right.

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.700
The SEED School.

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:21.990
[applause] All right, and the last
one, the Washington Global PCS.

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:31.680
[applause] We're all so happy
to have all of you here today,

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:43.050
so just one big round of
applause for all of you!

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:45.630
Now you're not the only
teenagers watching, by the way.

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:49.300
Today's event is being streamed on
the Library of Congress's Facebook

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:55.670
and YouTube channels, so for
everybody watching online, hello.

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:02.910
[applause] A lot of love from
Washington, and we just want

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:06.750
to say hi to all the kids who
are watching coast to coast.

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:11.310
Okay, we've got to
simmer it down now.

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.580
All right.

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:15.880
Now we're here today to talk

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.840
about a major moment in
civil rights history.

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:24.510
Several months ago, about a year
ago, the movie Loving came out,

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:28.520
and it was based on this very
important Supreme Court decision.

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.370
How many of you have
heard of the Lovings?

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:36.010
The adults say yes, so we're
hoping before this morning is over,

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:40.220
we would have educated
the students here today.

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:43.820
Believe it or not, there was
a time in American history

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:49.530
that white Americans and African
Americans could not get married.

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:51.700
I know it's very hard to wrap
your head around that nowadays,

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:54.690
but that was a dark
time in this history,

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:58.390
and you could've been thrown in
jail if a couple got married.

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:00.100
That's what happened
with the Lovings.

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:04.620
Mildred Jeter, who was black, and
Richard Loving, who was white,

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:07.220
lived in not-so-far Virginia.

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:09.860
They got married here in
Washington, and when they went home

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:13.130
to Central Point, they were
arrested and sentenced to a year

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:15.780
in prison just because
they were married.

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:18.430
Yes, really hard to
imagine that now.

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:20.900
Their case went all the
way to the Supreme Court,

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:24.360
and 50 years ago this
year, they won.

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.320
Their case changed the
law across the country

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:30.600
so that one's race does not
determine who one can marry.

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.080
The story has just been published

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:35.800
in a new book called
Loving vs. Virginia.

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.350
We have the author here
today, Patricia Hruby Powell,

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:43.170
and the book's illustrator Shadra
Strickland who's joined us here

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:44.470
on the stage.

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:48.000
We're also joined by an
expert lawyer and educator,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.330
Georgetown law professor
Elizabeth Hayes Patterson.

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:53.620
She's been teaching law
for almost 40 years,

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:56.390
and one of her specialties
is race and the law.

00:05:56.390 --> 00:06:01.050 position:56%
To lead our discussion this morning,
I'm very lucky to introduce her.

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:03.510
She's been a friend of mine
for almost a decade now.

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:06.180
We go a long way.

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:08.540
She's the Coordinator of
School and Student Services

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:11.770
for Baltimore's Enoch Pratt Free
Library where she spent more

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:15.480 position:56%
than 40 years as a mentor,
teacher, and advocate for librarians

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:17.180
and young adults just like you.

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:23.000
I used to work at the Pratt Library
with Deb, and we've come a long way

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.780 position:56%
from the Today Show to this morning.

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:30.350
Please, Deb Taylor will be
leading today's discussion.

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:33.540
Once again, thank you for joining
us, and I'll pass it on to Deb.

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:39.600
[applause]

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:42.250
&gt;&gt; DEB TAYLOR: Well, good morning,
and it's good to be with you

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:47.490 position:56%
to discuss this incredible book that
treats its subject and the people

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:49.470
who lived this piece of our history

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:52.840
with such artistry,
eloquence, and care.

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:56.960
Because this story is so important
to who we are as a nation,

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:01.700
we're also going to place it in
its social and historical context.

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:05.120
As Roswell told you, I'm
joined by an esteemed panel,

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:07.000
and following their introductions,

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.850
they will each give us brief
thoughts about the work

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:12.500
and the times that it depicts.

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:16.710
We're going to begin with a brief
video about the landmark decision

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:18.010
that we commemorate today.

00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:19.310
[video starts]

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:23.770
&gt;&gt; MILDRED LOVING: I'd say I
think that marrying who you want

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:27.870
to is a right that no man
should have anything to do with.

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:30.620
It's a God-given right, I think.

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:32.590
&gt;&gt; HOPE RYDEN: Mildred loving
married the boy next door,

00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:33.890
Richard Loving.

00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:35.500
Richard Loving is a
construction worker,

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:37.800
Mildred Loving the
daughter of a share cropper.

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:39.480
They were born and
raised in Caroline County,

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:42.100
Virginia where white and
colored people seem unaware

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:45.360
of the racial prejudice that
exists in much of the country.

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:47.910
The Lovings didn't know that it
was a crime for a white person

00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:49.630
to marry a negro in Virginia.

00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:50.930
They found out the hard way.

00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:57.370 position:56%
&gt;&gt; MILDRED LOVING: I didn't realize
how bad it was until we got married.

00:07:57.370 --> 00:07:58.670
&gt;&gt; HOPE RYDEN: Full
of love themselves,

00:07:58.670 --> 00:08:00.870
they didn't expect to
find hate in others.

00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:03.470
Their home swarms with
children, their own three,

00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:07.270
as well as neighborhood friends
who enjoy the warmth here.

00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:11.610
Mrs. Loving recalls how the
ordeal began one night in 1958.

00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:14.400
&gt;&gt; MILDRED LOVING: The
night we were arrested.

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:23.740 position:56%
I guess it was about 2:00 a.m. and
I saw this light you know and I woke

00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:27.440
up and it was the policeman
standing beside the bed.

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:33.420
He told us to get up,
and we was under arrest.

00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:35.200
&gt;&gt; RICHARD LOVING:
You go ahead and play.

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:37.900
&gt;&gt; MILDRED LOVING: Then,
anyway, they carried us

00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:41.060
to Bowling Green and
they locked us up.

00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:45.440
In January, they had the
trial, and they told us

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:49.210
to leave the state for 25 years.

00:08:49.210 --> 00:08:51.810
But the way I understood it, the
lawyer said that we could come back

00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:54.930
to visit when we wanted to.

00:08:54.930 --> 00:09:00.440
So, that Easter, we came
back and they got us again.

00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:01.950
&gt;&gt; RICHARD LOVING: We had been
there a few times before that,

00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:04.080
but at Easter we came down,
they found out we was down,

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:05.990
and they arrested us again.

00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:08.170
&gt;&gt; HOPE RYDEN: The Lovings spent
five years in a negro ghetto

00:09:08.170 --> 00:09:11.140
in Washington, DC where they
suffered the indignities

00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:14.140
of unemployment, loneliness,
and uncertainty.

00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:17.860
When one of the children, unused
to city streets, was hit by a car,

00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:19.980
Mrs. Loving decided to act.

00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:21.850
She wrote a letter to
the then Attorney General

00:09:21.850 --> 00:09:23.970
of the United States,
Robert Kennedy,

00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:27.820
who in turn passed the letter on to
a Virginia lawyer, Bernard Cohen,

00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:31.280
a member of the Civil
Liberties Union.

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:32.580
&gt;&gt; BERNARD COHEN: "We
have three children

00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:33.880
and cannot afford an attorney.

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:36.490
We wrote to the Attorney General
and he suggested that we get

00:09:36.490 --> 00:09:38.490
in touch with you for advice.

00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:39.790
Please help us if you can.

00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:41.450
Hope to hear from you real soon.

00:09:41.450 --> 00:09:44.390
Yours truly, Mr. and
Mrs. Richard Loving."

00:09:44.390 --> 00:09:49.160
It was that simple letter that got
us into this not-so-simple case.

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:51.750
&gt;&gt; HOPE RYDEN: Bernard Cohen
could and did help the Lovings.

00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:55.710
He teamed up with another attorney,
Phil Hirschkop, and at no fee,

00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:58.560
they reopened the Loving
case in the Virginia courts,

00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:00.540
appealing each losing decision

00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:03.580 position:56%
until at last the United States
Supreme Court heard these arguments.

00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:06.230
&gt;&gt; PHILL HIRSCHKOP:
Arguing for protection,

00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:10.390 position:56%
we advanced the arguments that
these statutes are slavery statutes.

00:10:10.390 --> 00:10:12.320
They're meant to keep
the negro people

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:14.660
in the badges and bonds of slavery.

00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:16.200
&gt;&gt; BERNARD COHEN: The
outrageous civil effects

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:20.700
of these statutes are not
always apparent right away.

00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:23.960
For example, if Richard
Loving were to die,

00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:25.880
then Mildred Loving
would not be able

00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:28.220
to collect social security
benefits as his widow.

00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:30.250
&gt;&gt; PHILL HIRSCHKOP: What is
fundamentally important, though,

00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:35.210
is we asked the court to decide
that a state may not pass a law

00:10:35.210 --> 00:10:38.430
which proscribes marriage
between two consenting,

00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:41.660
competent adults based
on race alone.

00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:42.980
&gt;&gt; HOPE RYDEN: The
attorneys for the state

00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:45.460
of Virginia refused
to talk with ABC.

00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:47.680
Bernard Cohen describes
their arguments.

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:48.980 position:56%
&gt;&gt; BERNARD COHEN: They seemed to say

00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:51.720
that there was a present day
justification for these laws.

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:55.630
That is that they're
interested in the welfare

00:10:55.630 --> 00:10:57.790
of the children of such marriages.

00:10:57.790 --> 00:11:00.060
&gt;&gt; HOPE RYDEN: Today, the United
States Supreme Court handed

00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:01.470
down a decision.

00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:04.270 position:56%
The Lovings' ordeal is at last over.

00:11:04.270 --> 00:11:07.680
Richard and Mildred Loving have
won the right to be man and wife,

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:10.490
father and mother, in
the state of Virginia.

00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:13.740
Anti-miscegenation laws have
been declared illegal not only

00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:18.130
in Virginia but in all 16 states
that have held such statutes.

00:11:18.130 --> 00:11:25.420
This is Hope Ryden,
ABC News, reporting.

00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:31.660
[applause]

00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:34.600
&gt;&gt; DEB TAYLOR: Before we begin,
we'd also like to remind the adults

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:37.950
in our audience that the last
20 minutes of the program are

00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:41.200
for questions and answers
between the students

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:43.430
and the participants on the stage.

00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:46.890
If time allows and there are no
students at the microphones set

00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:51.060
up in the aisles, we'll take
some questions from adults.

00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:55.340
Patricia Hruby Powell danced
throughout the Americas and Europe

00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:59.560

Shadra Strickland studied
design, writing, and illustration

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:43.340
at Syracuse University, and
later went on to complete her MFA

00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:46.800
at the School of Visual
Arts in New York City.

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:48.730
She won the Ezra Jack Keats Award

00:12:48.730 --> 00:12:53.930 position:56%

first picture book, Bird,

00:12:56.780 --> 00:12:58.570
written by Zetta Elliott.

00:12:58.570 --> 00:13:01.440
Strickland co-illustrated
Our Children Can Soar,

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:05.410

00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:08.270
Shadra travels the country
conducting workshops,

00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:11.990
sharing her work with children,
teachers, and librarians.

00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:14.050
She currently works and
teaches illustration

00:13:14.050 --> 00:13:16.840
at the Maryland Institute
College of Art in Baltimore.

00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:18.950
She's an incredible
asset to Baltimore arts

00:13:18.950 --> 00:13:21.510
and the literary community,
leading the effort

00:13:21.510 --> 00:13:24.830
to bring the Ezra Jack
Keats Bookmaking Competition

00:13:24.830 --> 00:13:27.440
to Baltimore City's public schools,

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:32.010
thus encouraging the next
generation of artists and writers.

00:13:32.010 --> 00:13:35.550
Elizabeth Hayes Patterson is
currently the Associate Director

00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:38.750

00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:40.050
in Washington, DC.

of the Georgetown University
Law Center.

00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:49.150
Before joining the Law Center
faculty, she served as Chair

00:13:49.150 --> 00:13:53.430
of the DC Public Service Utilities
Commission and was a commissioner

00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:56.130 position:56%

Elizabeth will lead us
off with her comments.

00:14:30.030 --> 00:14:31.330
&gt;&gt; ELIZABETH HAYES: Thank you.

00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:32.630
Good morning, everyone.

00:14:32.630 --> 00:14:33.930
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: Good morning.

00:14:33.930 --> 00:14:35.230
&gt;&gt; ELIZABETH HAYES: Well, first,

00:14:35.230 --> 00:14:36.530
I have to give a shout-out
to two schools.

00:14:36.530 --> 00:14:39.240
I welcome all the students,
but I have to recognize those

00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:40.970
from the Thurgood Marshall School.

00:14:40.970 --> 00:14:42.270
Thurgood Marshall was started

00:14:42.270 --> 00:14:44.660
by two Georgetown University
Law Center graduates,

00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:50.770
so a special welcome to you,
and a special welcome to those

00:14:50.770 --> 00:14:52.300
from SEED public charter school

00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:57.560
where our son Malcolm was
a resident instructor.

00:14:57.560 --> 00:15:01.270
So, I want to pick up on something
you heard in the tape, and that is,

00:15:01.270 --> 00:15:03.750
one of the lawyers, Phil
Hirschkop, referred to the fact

00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:07.950
that what they wanted to
do was to address a law

00:15:07.950 --> 00:15:11.240
that was a vestige of slavery.

00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:14.610
So, let's begin the legal
discussion by going back

00:15:14.610 --> 00:15:17.180
to the post-Civil War period.

00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:19.740
There were three important
amendments that were adopted

00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:22.820
at that time, and the goal was

00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:28.120
to fundamentally change the
status of the former slaves.

00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:31.470
So, the 13th amendment
abolished slavery.

00:15:31.470 --> 00:15:34.470
We'll go back to the 14th
amendment in a minute.

00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:40.930 position:56%
The 15th amendment gave the right to
vote, denied the ability of a state

00:15:40.930 --> 00:15:44.610
to withhold the vote from
people on the basis of race.

00:15:44.610 --> 00:15:46.080
Of course, you have to realize

00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:49.390
that that only affected
African American men.

00:15:49.390 --> 00:15:52.280
African American women had
to wait another 50 years,

00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:55.780
along with all women in this
country, to get the right to vote.

00:15:55.780 --> 00:16:00.880 position:56%
The 14th amendment, which is the one
that was most involved in this case,

00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:05.560
is the amendment that guaranteed
two things, that an individual

00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:08.650
in a state could not be
deprived of life, liberty,

00:16:08.650 --> 00:16:13.230
or property without what's
called due process of law,

00:16:13.230 --> 00:16:16.830
and the second was to
guarantee the equal protection

00:16:16.830 --> 00:16:20.340
of the laws in the states.

00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:26.100 position:56%
So, what did equal protection of
the laws mean for the former slaves?

00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:29.460
The Supreme Court answered
that in 1896

00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:33.080
in a case titled Plessy
vs. Ferguson.

00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:36.870
Plessy vs. Ferguson came out
of the state of Louisiana.

00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:40.230
Louisiana had a law that said that
black people and white people have

00:16:40.230 --> 00:16:42.650
to be separated in railroad cars.

00:16:42.650 --> 00:16:46.980
They cannot sit together in the
same car, let alone the same seat.

00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:51.600
Homer Plessy challenged that law,
and he, as you might imagine,

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:55.020 position:56%
assumed that with the passage of
the 14th amendment and the guarantee

00:16:55.020 --> 00:16:59.940
of equal treatment under the law
that that law would be struck down.

00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:01.890
That didn't happen.

00:17:01.890 --> 00:17:06.480
The Supreme Court determined that
the states could separate people

00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:10.140
by race as long as
things were equal.

00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:18.100
This doctrine of "separate but
equal" was a doctrine that lasted

00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:24.430
for a long time and allowed states
to pass laws, which they did,

00:17:24.430 --> 00:17:28.920
that either required or allowed
the separation of people by race

00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:37.390
in movie theaters, in restaurants,
in libraries, in restrooms.

00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:39.320
During that period of time also was

00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:43.590
when Virginia passed the Racial
Integrity Act, which is described.

00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:47.960
If you look at the slide,
it's in the bottom middle.

00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:50.970
The Virginia Bulletin
explains this act.

00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:56.410
It basically said that white and
non-white people cannot marry,

00:17:56.410 --> 00:18:00.870
and if they do, it's a crime.

00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:05.250
So, this was what we had as
law, "separate but equal,"

00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:08.170
laws like the State of
Virginia's that prohibited marriage

00:18:08.170 --> 00:18:13.450
between people of different
races until 1954.

00:18:13.450 --> 00:18:19.030
And in 1954, the Supreme Court
decided the case of Brown vs. Board

00:18:19.030 --> 00:18:22.840
of Education, and I'm sure
you've all heard about that.

00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:26.800
That was the case where the court
looked at this whole "separate

00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:31.850
but equal" doctrine and determined,
and if you look at the same slide,

00:18:31.850 --> 00:18:35.740
to the left, bottom left,
Brown vs. Board of Education,

00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:39.380
there's the important language
where the Court said when it comes

00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:45.090
to education, separate
is inherently unequal,

00:18:45.090 --> 00:18:48.110
meaning there's no
way there's equality

00:18:48.110 --> 00:18:52.100
when the state says black
children have to go to school here,

00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:55.600
white children have
to go to school there.

00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:58.000
Totally unacceptable.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.560
That ushered in what
we call the period

00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:05.560
of a new Civil Rights
Movement, if you will.

00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:10.550
And two important events
happened the next year, in 1955.

00:19:10.550 --> 00:19:16.510
In August of 1955,
14-year-old Emmett Till was

00:19:16.510 --> 00:19:19.320
in Mississippi and he was murdered.

00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:21.240
He was murdered why?

00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:25.480
Because it's alleged that
he insulted a white woman.

00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:26.780
How did he insult her?

00:19:26.780 --> 00:19:30.240
He either whistled or he
said something to her.

00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:31.540
That's it.

00:19:31.540 --> 00:19:38.370
And then in December of 1955, I
know you remember, Rosa Parks,

00:19:38.370 --> 00:19:42.540
Mrs. Rosa Parks, refused to give
up her seat on a bus in Montgomery,

00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:47.250
Alabama, and the Montgomery
bus boycott started.

00:19:47.250 --> 00:19:53.020
After that, in 1955, one
other important thing,

00:19:53.020 --> 00:19:56.380
the state of Virginia
announced that it would engage

00:19:56.380 --> 00:20:00.160
in massive resistance to
the Supreme Court decision

00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:02.060
in Brown vs. Board of Education.

00:20:02.060 --> 00:20:05.950
And on the slide, lower
right, you see a reference

00:20:05.950 --> 00:20:09.760
to Senator Harry Byrd of Virginia
who talked about that fact.

00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:15.860
Virginia resisted so much that they
closed the public schools rather

00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:17.860
than integrate them.

00:20:17.860 --> 00:20:21.250
And there was one county in
Virginia, Prince Edward County,

00:20:21.250 --> 00:20:25.670
about 90 miles from here,
where the schools stayed closed

00:20:25.670 --> 00:20:29.860
for five years, from 1959 to 1964.

00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:37.190
So, that is the atmosphere
within which Mildred Jeter

00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:41.540
and Richard Loving had
their relationship begin.

00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:47.250
&gt;&gt; DEB TAYLOR: So, you can see
that we have a very dramatic time,

00:20:47.250 --> 00:20:51.750
but we're talking about people
who are living their lives

00:20:51.750 --> 00:20:54.780
and who are not necessarily caught

00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:58.130
up in the drama, as
we saw on the slide.

00:20:58.130 --> 00:20:59.900
Now we come to that story,

00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:04.170
and I'd want to start
by asking Patricia, why?

00:21:04.170 --> 00:21:07.740
Why this story for
this time when so many

00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:10.840
of our young people
don't know this history

00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:13.230
or may not feel it applies to them?

00:21:13.230 --> 00:21:17.340
Why did this story compel
you to write about it?

00:21:17.340 --> 00:21:22.210
&gt;&gt; PATRICIA POWELL:
It's a story of love.

00:21:22.210 --> 00:21:27.600
The name of the couple,
Loving, their name was Loving,

00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:31.690
and they were very much in love,
and I got to tell a love story in

00:21:31.690 --> 00:21:34.200
and amongst the Civil
Rights Movement.

00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:35.730
All those slides that
you were seeing

00:21:35.730 --> 00:21:43.050
on Ginger Elizabeth's page
were pages of the book,

00:21:43.050 --> 00:21:45.040
as are these in front of you.

00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:51.700
I came from a very socially
conscious family and we saw

00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:57.060
by example that when somebody
needed help, you helped,

00:21:57.060 --> 00:21:59.150
so it was a very compelling
story for this reason.

00:21:59.150 --> 00:22:00.810
Do you want me to go
into the research?

00:22:00.810 --> 00:22:02.110
&gt;&gt; DEB TAYLOR: Sure.

00:22:02.110 --> 00:22:03.410
&gt;&gt; PATRICIA POWELL: Okay.

00:22:03.410 --> 00:22:04.710
Before the story even begins,

00:22:04.710 --> 00:22:08.980
we have the health bulletin
called the Racial Integrity Act

00:22:08.980 --> 00:22:12.990
that Walter Plecker in 1924
put into place in Virginia,

00:22:12.990 --> 00:22:18.960 position:56%
and it was the law in Virginia until
1967 when the US Supreme Court ruled

00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:21.710
in favor of interracial marriage.

00:22:21.710 --> 00:22:25.220
And what it says, I'm not sure
if you can read it up there,

00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:29.870
but about two-thirds down, it
says there are people in Virginia

00:22:29.870 --> 00:22:33.910
who are posing for white,
but they're not really white.

00:22:33.910 --> 00:22:39.360 position:56%
If you are one-16th Native American,
then you can call yourself white

00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:42.830
if everything else in
your family is white,

00:22:42.830 --> 00:22:46.620
but if you are one-16th
African American

00:22:46.620 --> 00:22:49.270
and everything else is
white, you are not white.

00:22:49.270 --> 00:22:52.780
That means if you have one
great, great grandparent

00:22:52.780 --> 00:22:59.020
who is African American, then
you are not a white person.

00:22:59.020 --> 00:23:02.840 position:56%
So, what it's saying is we know that
there are people in there pretending

00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:06.450
to be white who are intermarrying,
but you may not do that,

00:23:06.450 --> 00:23:09.240
and if we catch you,
it's against the law.

00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:13.300
So, on the right there, we have
the photograph of the classrooms,

00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:18.390
the white classroom and the black
classroom, and this is under the

00:23:18.390 --> 00:23:22.440
"separate but equal" law
that Ginger was mentioning,

00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:25.450
the Plessy vs. Ferguson.

00:23:25.450 --> 00:23:31.260
Does that look equal to
you, those two classrooms?

00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:32.560
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: No.

00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:37.780
&gt;&gt; PATRICIA POWELL:
I don't think so.

00:23:37.780 --> 00:23:40.730
Could I have the slide
changed, please?

00:23:40.730 --> 00:23:45.800
I did my research in
Virginia, Caroline County

00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:49.980
where the family lived in a
very integrated neighborhood

00:23:49.980 --> 00:23:52.070
in a very segregated state.

00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:55.300
This is Otha Jeter, Mildred
Jeter's older brother.

00:23:55.300 --> 00:23:58.540
Both Mildred and Richard
are deceased,

00:23:58.540 --> 00:24:03.240
but I talked to family members
and friends of the family.

00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:08.330
The place is very important
here because my story starts,

00:24:08.330 --> 00:24:10.340
our story starts, in 1952.

00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:13.530 position:56%
The movie starts when they get
married in '58, but our story starts

00:24:13.530 --> 00:24:17.140
in '52 when Mildred is 11
years old and Richard is

00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:19.520
about 16 or 17 years old.

00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:22.410
And they grew up in this
neighborhood together,

00:24:22.410 --> 00:24:24.640
and I got stories from
the family members

00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:28.800
of what happened in their lives.

00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:33.000
Doing my research, I used primary
sources which are artifacts

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.310
from the time, and I just
thought it was interesting

00:24:35.310 --> 00:24:39.500
to see how messy they are.

00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:43.980
On the very top one, it
reads, "Richard Loving,

00:24:43.980 --> 00:24:48.820
a white man, and 'Whoosh' Jeter."

00:24:48.820 --> 00:24:54.140
They don't even dignify
her to give her name.

00:24:54.140 --> 00:24:58.080
He is white and she is black,
and her name is not even on it.

00:24:58.080 --> 00:25:02.460
Here is her arrest warrant,
this mess of a page below it.

00:25:02.460 --> 00:25:05.400
She was arrested in bed in 1958

00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:08.850
after they were married,
and then another.

00:25:08.850 --> 00:25:11.600
And then they were exiled.

00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:15.070
We know a lot of the story that
says they were sentenced to a year

00:25:15.070 --> 00:25:18.890
in jail or 25 years exile,
and they were exiled.

00:25:18.890 --> 00:25:21.890
They lived in a slum
in Washington, DC.

00:25:21.890 --> 00:25:28.680
That was '58, and in 1963,
they tried to get the case,

00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:36.330 position:56%
the ACLU lawyers, Bernie Cohen and
Phil Hirschkop, back into the courts

00:25:36.330 --> 00:25:42.540
by bringing it to Leon Bazile
who was the judge for the case.

00:25:42.540 --> 00:25:45.970
And he wrote this very
racist statement,

00:25:45.970 --> 00:25:51.710
which was actually very
helpful to the ACLU lawyers

00:25:51.710 --> 00:25:53.270
because it was so racist.

00:25:53.270 --> 00:25:57.460
And what he said was,
"Almighty God ..."

00:25:57.460 --> 00:25:59.940
&gt;&gt; DEB TAYLOR: Here it is.

00:25:59.940 --> 00:26:01.470
&gt;&gt; PATRICIA POWELL: Thank you.

00:26:01.470 --> 00:26:05.040
"Almighty God created the races
white, black, yellow, melee,

00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:08.080
and red, and he placed them
on separate continents,

00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:12.620
but for the interference
with His arrangement,

00:26:12.620 --> 00:26:16.340
there would be no cause
for such marriages.

00:26:16.340 --> 00:26:18.900
The fact that He separated
the races shows

00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:22.180
that He did not intend
for the races to mix."

00:26:22.180 --> 00:26:25.680
And Mildred thinks about
that and said, "Hmm.

00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:30.260
This was a nation of red people
that was stolen by white people,

00:26:30.260 --> 00:26:35.480
and the black people were
stolen from the African people."

00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:37.400
I don't know if she
really said that.

00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:38.700
That is speculation.

00:26:38.700 --> 00:26:40.000
This is a documentary novel.

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:41.990 position:56%
It means it's an informational book,

00:26:41.990 --> 00:26:45.150
but I told it in the voices
of Richard and Mildred.

00:26:45.150 --> 00:26:49.630 position:56%
&gt;&gt; DEB TAYLOR: You talked about some
of the documents that are a part

00:26:49.630 --> 00:26:50.930
of the book, and I think

00:26:50.930 --> 00:26:55.200
that creates a particular
context for students.

00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:59.520
Shadra, I have to ask you,
because it's unusual to have a book

00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:05.140
that is written for teenagers,
primarily, to have illustrations.

00:27:05.140 --> 00:27:08.430
What do you think your
illustrations brought to the text

00:27:08.430 --> 00:27:09.730
and brought to the story?

00:27:09.730 --> 00:27:13.010
&gt;&gt; SHADRA STRICKLAND: Well, I
teach at Maryland Institute College

00:27:13.010 --> 00:27:16.190
of Art, and I teach a class
called visual journalism

00:27:16.190 --> 00:27:20.300
where we take students out into
the world and draw on location.

00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:24.200
And I had wanted to use these
drawings in some real context,

00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:25.940
but they wouldn't necessarily
be appropriate

00:27:25.940 --> 00:27:28.540
for a picture book for
very young readers.

00:27:28.540 --> 00:27:30.280
But my agent was like,
"Let's just put them

00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:32.060
on the website and
see what happens."

00:27:32.060 --> 00:27:36.210
Chronicle Books, our publisher, saw
these images and they contacted me

00:27:36.210 --> 00:27:40.140
about contributing to this book,
so I got really lucky, basically.

00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:44.750
I think the illustrations
add more of the love story.

00:27:44.750 --> 00:27:49.250
You can see the slide behind us is
one of my favorite illustrations

00:27:49.250 --> 00:27:53.310
of Richard and Mildred stealing
away to run through the woods

00:27:53.310 --> 00:27:55.810
and spend time with each other.

00:27:55.810 --> 00:28:00.230
When I talked to the art director
and the editor at Chronicle,

00:28:00.230 --> 00:28:05.450
we really wanted to focus on their
lives as just individual people

00:28:05.450 --> 00:28:09.750
as opposed to the law and the
other interference with that life.

00:28:09.750 --> 00:28:14.360
So, I think that the illustrations
add that level of softness

00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:18.970
and hopefully a bit of magic
between the two of them,

00:28:18.970 --> 00:28:21.320
and showing their chemistry
and their love for one another,

00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:23.110
and illustrations are nice.

00:28:23.110 --> 00:28:27.780
It's nice to look at beautiful
drawings in the middle of a lot

00:28:27.780 --> 00:28:33.250
of intense, legal documents,
and then story itself.

00:28:33.250 --> 00:28:35.800
&gt;&gt; DEB TAYLOR: Elizabeth,
I remember that news clip.

00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:38.900
I'm old enough that that's
not something new to me,

00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:41.730
to see that news clip when
the decision came down,

00:28:41.730 --> 00:28:46.260
yet I also remember that there
were states as late as 2000

00:28:46.260 --> 00:28:49.890
that were just removing
the laws from the books.

00:28:49.890 --> 00:28:51.570
What did that mean, if anything?

00:28:51.570 --> 00:28:54.520
Why were they holding on to
those laws if it had been struck

00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:56.700
down through the Loving case?

00:28:56.700 --> 00:28:58.440
&gt;&gt; ELIZABETH HAYES:
Well, unfortunately,

00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:01.720
even though the law may be one way,

00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:05.220
legislatures are sometimes
very slow to act to change.

00:29:05.220 --> 00:29:09.450
I can't say, I can't read into
the mind of the legislators,

00:29:09.450 --> 00:29:12.530
and that was in Alabama that
finally, in the year 2000 ...

00:29:12.530 --> 00:29:13.830
&gt;&gt; DEB TAYLOR: Mm-hmm.

00:29:13.830 --> 00:29:15.130
That finally did it, yes.

00:29:15.130 --> 00:29:16.430
&gt;&gt; ELIZABETH HAYES: That's right.

00:29:16.430 --> 00:29:17.730
I can't say that it
was an act of defiance.

00:29:17.730 --> 00:29:20.390
I suspect that it was maybe
a little of that and a little

00:29:20.390 --> 00:29:22.450
of just not wanting to do it,

00:29:22.450 --> 00:29:25.300
not thinking that it was
an important thing to do.

00:29:25.300 --> 00:29:28.090
The important thing is
that despite the fact

00:29:28.090 --> 00:29:30.590
that Alabama did not remove
the law from the books

00:29:30.590 --> 00:29:34.300
until 2000, the law was changed.

00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:39.020
Once the Supreme Court made
the decision, that was it.

00:29:39.020 --> 00:29:42.540
&gt;&gt; DEB TAYLOR: One of the
things that stood out for me

00:29:42.540 --> 00:29:46.680
from reading the book was
even though there were all

00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:51.950
of these social restrictions on
Richard and Mildred when they were

00:29:51.950 --> 00:29:55.490
in Virginia, Virginia was home.

00:29:55.490 --> 00:30:00.230
And one of the things that comes
across both in the illustrations

00:30:00.230 --> 00:30:04.240
and in the poetry is
the fact that that was,

00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:07.130
even with all of its
problems, it was home.

00:30:07.130 --> 00:30:11.810
How were you able to get that
across, that this whole idea

00:30:11.810 --> 00:30:16.630
of the distinction between
being exiled, so to speak,

00:30:16.630 --> 00:30:20.840
and then wanting so
desperately to come home?

00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:22.140
&gt;&gt; PATRICIA POWELL: May I talk?

00:30:22.140 --> 00:30:23.590
&gt;&gt; DEB TAYLOR: Yeah, please.

00:30:23.590 --> 00:30:28.440
&gt;&gt; PATRICIA POWELL: It starts in
1952 when Mildred is 11 years old,

00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:32.500
and Richard is the background

00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:35.270
because he is friends
with her big brothers.

00:30:35.270 --> 00:30:39.310
It shows how they grow up
together in this interracial,

00:30:39.310 --> 00:30:43.240
intergenerational,
sort of idyllic setting

00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:47.070
where they had parties
after the families.

00:30:47.070 --> 00:30:48.600
They were self-sufficient farmers

00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:50.620
and there would be
hog-slaughtering times.

00:30:50.620 --> 00:30:53.970
So, after hog-slaughtering and
all the neighbors came to help,

00:30:53.970 --> 00:30:55.950
there would be a big party.

00:30:55.950 --> 00:31:00.490
Mildred's older brothers and
father played in a string band,

00:31:00.490 --> 00:31:04.000
and they were the entertainment
for the neighborhood.

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:08.870
There was this beautiful
community of whites and blacks

00:31:08.870 --> 00:31:14.070
and Indians together who
just had this wonderful life.

00:31:14.070 --> 00:31:20.180
To be exiled in Washington
was so very different.

00:31:20.180 --> 00:31:23.290
They lived in a very small
apartment, and it was dirty,

00:31:23.290 --> 00:31:25.540
and there were lights
on all the time.

00:31:25.540 --> 00:31:29.980
It was opposed to nature, the
natural world around them.

00:31:29.980 --> 00:31:34.700
It just did not feel like Earth to
Mildred to be in Washington, DC.

00:31:34.700 --> 00:31:39.610
She wanted the pastoral scene
of her childhood and her family,

00:31:39.610 --> 00:31:44.440
a very close-knit family, and
the neighbors were all friends.

00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:47.030
&gt;&gt; DEB TAYLOR: Shadra, could
you speak to the book design?

00:31:47.030 --> 00:31:48.330
&gt;&gt; SHADRA STRICKLAND: Sure.

00:31:48.330 --> 00:31:49.630
Can I talk a little bit
about the other, the family?

00:31:49.630 --> 00:31:50.930
&gt;&gt; DEB TAYLOR: Absolutely.

00:31:50.930 --> 00:31:52.230
&gt;&gt; SHADRA STRICKLAND: I grew
up in Georgia, in Atlanta,

00:31:52.230 --> 00:31:55.410
and the Civil Rights Movement
was the topic of conversation

00:31:55.410 --> 00:31:58.510
at the dinner table all
the time with my family.

00:31:58.510 --> 00:32:00.150
So, in making the illustrations,

00:32:00.150 --> 00:32:02.570
even though I didn't have a time
machine where I could go back

00:32:02.570 --> 00:32:06.200
in time and just sit there and
draw the Lovings as they grew up,

00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:09.930
things felt very familiar in
the writing with my own mother

00:32:09.930 --> 00:32:13.020
and siblings, and the way that
we sort of managed community,

00:32:13.020 --> 00:32:16.980
and my grandmother growing
collard greens and tomatoes.

00:32:16.980 --> 00:32:20.670
It was helpful to have grown up
with that experience to be able

00:32:20.670 --> 00:32:23.630
to make it real in
the illustrations.

00:32:23.630 --> 00:32:26.760
The book design, Chronicle
makes really beautiful books.

00:32:26.760 --> 00:32:28.190
You'll see the book.

00:32:28.190 --> 00:32:30.930
It's gorgeous.

00:32:30.930 --> 00:32:36.180
I really love this Dayglo orange
cover, hardcover that we have,

00:32:36.180 --> 00:32:40.860
but I felt like we worked closely
together in sort of talking

00:32:40.860 --> 00:32:44.310
about the mood that we wanted
to portray in the story.

00:32:44.310 --> 00:32:45.610
I'll show you some.

00:32:45.610 --> 00:32:47.720
Can we get to the next
slide, please?

00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:50.190
The next one.

00:32:50.190 --> 00:32:51.490
The next one.

00:32:51.490 --> 00:32:55.670
The next one.

00:32:55.670 --> 00:32:57.430
The next one.

00:32:57.430 --> 00:32:58.890
Okay, one more.

00:32:58.890 --> 00:33:01.910
That one. So, the first thing
that we understood going in was

00:33:01.910 --> 00:33:05.820
that we wanted the book to be
printed in two colors to give a nod

00:33:05.820 --> 00:33:08.720
to two-color printing
back during the day

00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:11.000
when printing was more expensive.

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:14.940
You could only afford to print
with a limited number of colors.

00:33:14.940 --> 00:33:18.240
You can see here in these slides,
this is some of the conversation

00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:20.680
that I was having with the
designer, which is great.

00:33:20.680 --> 00:33:23.670 position:56%
Most times, I don't get to work that
closely with the designer of a book,

00:33:23.670 --> 00:33:26.480
but because I have
design background,

00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:28.850
we were able to have
intelligent conversations.

00:33:28.850 --> 00:33:30.660
So, these are the two ...

00:33:30.660 --> 00:33:34.410
I sent maybe, I don't know, four
or five different color choices.

00:33:34.410 --> 00:33:39.300
I was really in love with the green
and rusty red color combination,

00:33:39.300 --> 00:33:42.540
but that felt a little too
heavy, and then we finally got

00:33:42.540 --> 00:33:45.840
to this purple and gold
which when they overlapped,

00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:48.390
they made a really nice
rich brown which makes sense

00:33:48.390 --> 00:33:51.290
for illustrating Mildred.

00:33:51.290 --> 00:33:54.280
It worked out and it
was just great fun

00:33:54.280 --> 00:33:56.210
to be able to work with Chronicle.

00:33:56.210 --> 00:33:59.880
A big part of visual
journalism is back in the '50s,

00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:03.180
Leo Lionni was an art
director for Fortune magazine,

00:34:03.180 --> 00:34:06.130
and he really brought visual
journalism to the forefront

00:34:06.130 --> 00:34:09.890
and hired illustrators to
do what they wanted to do,

00:34:09.890 --> 00:34:12.810
basically go out on location and
draw, but there was a lot of trust

00:34:12.810 --> 00:34:15.460
that had to go into that
relationship, and I really felt

00:34:15.460 --> 00:34:18.640
that Chronicle gave me that when we
were working on this book together.

00:34:18.640 --> 00:34:20.390
&gt;&gt; DEB TAYLOR: I think we have time

00:34:20.390 --> 00:34:24.650
for one more little
bit of discussion here.

00:34:24.650 --> 00:34:29.790
I'd like to talk about the 14th
amendment just for a moment

00:34:29.790 --> 00:34:33.780
since so much of the case hinged
on that, and you made reference

00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:36.130
to it in your opening remarks.

00:34:36.130 --> 00:34:41.370
How were they able to zero
in on the 14th amendment

00:34:41.370 --> 00:34:44.700
and to make their case when
they had not been successful

00:34:44.700 --> 00:34:46.000
at all of the lower courts?

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:49.720
Was it just because they were
with a more sympathetic court

00:34:49.720 --> 00:34:54.350
or were they able to craft
a story or craft a way

00:34:54.350 --> 00:34:58.360
of understanding the 14th
amendment that won their case?

00:34:58.360 --> 00:35:00.390
&gt;&gt; ELIZABETH HAYES: I think
that the lawyers assumed

00:35:00.390 --> 00:35:03.740
that they would not prevail
in Virginia at any level,

00:35:03.740 --> 00:35:07.360
and based upon the history of
the state, that was accurate.

00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:11.090
We've referred to the 1924 Racial
Integrity Act, but Virginia

00:35:11.090 --> 00:35:13.600
and Maryland were the
first two colonies,

00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:15.790
even before this was a country,

00:35:15.790 --> 00:35:18.910
that had passed laws
prohibiting interracial marriage,

00:35:18.910 --> 00:35:24.860
so this is a very long, entrenched
history in the State of Virginia.

00:35:24.860 --> 00:35:28.790
So, I think it isn't that they
crafted different arguments.

00:35:28.790 --> 00:35:32.600
They made the same arguments with
respect to the equal protection

00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:35.490
and due process rights
of the Lovings,

00:35:35.490 --> 00:35:38.260
but they knew that they weren't
going to prevail in Virginia

00:35:38.260 --> 00:35:41.330
with that very entrenched history.

00:35:41.330 --> 00:35:45.390
With the Supreme Court, they
made basically two arguments.

00:35:45.390 --> 00:35:50.300
One is that marriage is a
fundamental right for everybody.

00:35:50.300 --> 00:35:53.160
Everybody ought to be
able to make a decision

00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:56.440
if you've got consenting adults,
and this is one of the things

00:35:56.440 --> 00:35:58.320
that Phil Hirschkop said.

00:35:58.320 --> 00:36:02.620
When you have two consenting
adults who want to marry,

00:36:02.620 --> 00:36:06.810
to deny that right on the basis
of race is unconstitutional.

00:36:06.810 --> 00:36:08.530
It interferes with
the fundamental right

00:36:08.530 --> 00:36:13.310
and it makes a classification
based on race which is not allowed

00:36:13.310 --> 00:36:14.820
under the 14th amendment.

00:36:14.820 --> 00:36:17.400
So, that's why they were successful
in making those arguments,

00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:20.150
but we also have to remember
that we've had Brown vs. Board

00:36:20.150 --> 00:36:23.980
of Education decided, so we had
to have a change to "separate

00:36:23.980 --> 00:36:27.850
but equal" in order
to get to Loving.

00:36:27.850 --> 00:36:30.470
&gt;&gt; DEB TAYLOR: Well, before we
move to opening the microphones

00:36:30.470 --> 00:36:33.790
up to the students, I do
want to give a shout-out

00:36:33.790 --> 00:36:37.130
to a wonderful teacher's
guide that the publisher

00:36:37.130 --> 00:36:38.840
of the book has prepared.

00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:43.150
It was actually done by a
colleague, Dr. Ebony Thomas

00:36:43.150 --> 00:36:44.830 position:56%
from the University of Pennsylvania.

00:36:44.830 --> 00:36:47.330
So, there are great
questions and opportunities

00:36:47.330 --> 00:36:53.780
to really pursue these subjects
in a much more in-depth way.

00:36:53.780 --> 00:36:56.690
I think that we've been
given a great introduction

00:36:56.690 --> 00:37:00.520
to how we can see this story
and how we can place it

00:37:00.520 --> 00:37:02.810
in our own national history.

00:37:02.810 --> 00:37:05.580
So, if there are students
who have questions,

00:37:05.580 --> 00:37:07.810
would you please approach
the microphones?

00:37:07.810 --> 00:37:12.560
I see there's somebody
approaching the microphone.

00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:13.860
That's great.

00:37:13.860 --> 00:37:16.130
Bear with me because
I can see nothing.

00:37:16.130 --> 00:37:20.630 position:56%
These lights are shining in my eyes,
so if I miss someone who is standing

00:37:20.630 --> 00:37:23.870
at a microphone, you might
need to do a little wave.

00:37:23.870 --> 00:37:25.170
&gt;&gt; ELIZABETH HAYES: There we go.

00:37:25.170 --> 00:37:28.590
&gt;&gt; DEB TAYLOR: That's better.

00:37:28.590 --> 00:37:29.950
&gt;&gt; ELIZABETH HAYES: That helps.

00:37:29.950 --> 00:37:32.560
&gt;&gt; DEB TAYLOR: Yes.

00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:41.020
Is there someone?

00:37:41.020 --> 00:37:49.900
&gt;&gt; PATRICIA POWELL: Once
they start, they won't stop.

00:37:49.900 --> 00:37:51.200
[pause]

00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:52.830
&gt;&gt; DEB TAYLOR: While we're
waiting for a student to come

00:37:52.830 --> 00:38:01.740
to the microphone, I have another
question for Patricia particularly.

00:38:01.740 --> 00:38:06.540
We focus a lot on the
Lovings and as a couple,

00:38:06.540 --> 00:38:10.630
and we see how they grow
together in their community.

00:38:10.630 --> 00:38:16.070
Did you find any kind of written
information about the children

00:38:16.070 --> 00:38:20.660
that grew up in that household at
that time when they were trying

00:38:20.660 --> 00:38:24.910
to establish their legal
right to be married?

00:38:24.910 --> 00:38:26.210
&gt;&gt; PATRICIA POWELL: Are you talking

00:38:26.210 --> 00:38:27.750
about Richard and Mildred's
children?

00:38:27.750 --> 00:38:31.190
&gt;&gt; DEB TAYLOR: Richard
and Mildred's children.

00:38:31.190 --> 00:38:33.380
&gt;&gt; PATRICIA POWELL: What
I know about that is

00:38:33.380 --> 00:38:36.020
that the parents did
not want their children

00:38:36.020 --> 00:38:37.990
to have anything to do with it.

00:38:37.990 --> 00:38:41.390
They did not want their children
to be burdened by it in any way,

00:38:41.390 --> 00:38:42.780 position:56%
so they kept it from their children,

00:38:42.780 --> 00:38:46.530
so their children did not
know much about it at all.

00:38:46.530 --> 00:38:47.830
&gt;&gt; DEB TAYLOR: What
they were going through.

00:38:47.830 --> 00:38:50.130
&gt;&gt; PATRICIA POWELL: Plus,
they were quite young.

00:38:50.130 --> 00:38:52.940
This was up 'til 1967.

00:38:52.940 --> 00:38:56.860
They were born in the late '50s,
so they were under 10 years old.

00:38:56.860 --> 00:38:58.160
&gt;&gt; DEB TAYLOR: Okay.

00:38:58.160 --> 00:39:00.410
Do we have a question yet?

00:39:00.410 --> 00:39:02.790
Okay.

00:39:02.790 --> 00:39:05.410
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: What are you
guys' thoughts on the book?

00:39:05.410 --> 00:39:07.650
&gt;&gt; PATRICIA POWELL: What?

00:39:07.650 --> 00:39:08.950
&gt;&gt; ELIZABETH HAYES:
What's the question?

00:39:08.950 --> 00:39:10.730
&gt;&gt; DEB TAYLOR: What are your
thoughts about the book?

00:39:10.730 --> 00:39:12.030
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: The story.

00:39:12.030 --> 00:39:13.330
&gt;&gt; DEB TAYLOR: What
are your thoughts

00:39:13.330 --> 00:39:15.700
about how the book might be
received by young people?

00:39:15.700 --> 00:39:19.670
&gt;&gt; SHADRA STRICKLAND: I think
when I received the book ...

00:39:19.670 --> 00:39:23.080
When we're working on these
things, it's all in the air.

00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:25.460
It doesn't become a book
until it becomes a book.

00:39:25.460 --> 00:39:27.480
So, you're delivering
these beautiful words,

00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:30.660
you're delivering this artwork,
and you're having conversations

00:39:30.660 --> 00:39:33.660
about what the book might look
like and how it is received,

00:39:33.660 --> 00:39:35.220 position:56%
but you never know until you get it.

00:39:35.220 --> 00:39:38.090
When I received this in the
mail, the first thing I thought

00:39:38.090 --> 00:39:40.940
as an artist is like,
"Oh, it's so beautiful."

00:39:40.940 --> 00:39:45.230
It's just such a beautiful,
substantial book.

00:39:45.230 --> 00:39:47.250
A very important piece of ...

00:39:47.250 --> 00:39:51.100
It feels very important in your
hands, so I was glad for that.

00:39:51.100 --> 00:39:54.940
And I think that young
readers will appreciate

00:39:54.940 --> 00:39:58.370
that as they're reading the story
and taking it very seriously

00:39:58.370 --> 00:39:59.840
as a piece of literature.

00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:03.990
And in terms of the story itself,
it's a beautiful love story.

00:40:03.990 --> 00:40:05.570 position:56%
It really is a beautiful love story,

00:40:05.570 --> 00:40:08.270
and Patricia can talk
a bit more about that.

00:40:08.270 --> 00:40:10.100
&gt;&gt; PATRICIA POWELL: Well, I think
partly, what's so interesting

00:40:10.100 --> 00:40:12.370
about it is the story
is all told in verse.

00:40:12.370 --> 00:40:15.720
There's a whole lot of white space
on the page, so it's easy to read.

00:40:15.720 --> 00:40:17.570
It's fast to read.

00:40:17.570 --> 00:40:20.430
There are photographs from
the Civil Rights Movement,

00:40:20.430 --> 00:40:24.700
most of which I first found
at the Library of Congress.

00:40:24.700 --> 00:40:32.000
It's not like you just go to
the Library of Congress and say,

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:33.360
"May I have that photo, please?"

00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:34.930
There's quite a process.

00:40:34.930 --> 00:40:38.190
You find the photo at the Library
of Congress, and then you find

00:40:38.190 --> 00:40:43.270
out who owns it, and you
find out who you must pay

00:40:43.270 --> 00:40:45.330
to get permission to use it.

00:40:45.330 --> 00:40:50.730
But, I think that you'll look at
these photographs, this one is,

00:40:50.730 --> 00:40:53.990
"Race-mixing is communism,"
and you go, "Whoo!

00:40:53.990 --> 00:40:55.290
That's interesting."

00:40:55.290 --> 00:40:59.480
And you think about it and you
go, "What does that mean?,"

00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:03.450
and I think what it means is in
1959 when this photo was taken

00:41:03.450 --> 00:41:09.000 position:56%
and where this is placed in the book
in 1959, the timeline of the book,

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:13.250
the US was just terrified
of communism and the USSR.

00:41:13.250 --> 00:41:18.270
It was just the worst
slur you could use

00:41:18.270 --> 00:41:21.070
for an American, so
they just used it.

00:41:21.070 --> 00:41:25.040
So, there's a whole lot of
American history in here

00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:31.300
that it just gives you a view
of the Civil Rights Movement,

00:41:31.300 --> 00:41:34.210
a particular thread of
the Civil Rights Movement.

00:41:34.210 --> 00:41:35.730
We've got the Freedom Riders.

00:41:35.730 --> 00:41:37.030
We have the lunch counters.

00:41:37.030 --> 00:41:38.520
I think we have another
person at the microphone.

00:41:38.520 --> 00:41:39.820
&gt;&gt; DEB TAYLOR: Yes.

00:41:39.820 --> 00:41:41.120
We've got a question up here.

00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:43.690
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: What challenges did
you face while writing the book?

00:41:43.690 --> 00:41:44.990
&gt;&gt; SHADRA STRICKLAND: I'm sorry?

00:41:44.990 --> 00:41:47.150
&gt;&gt; DEB TAYLOR: What challenges did
you face while working on the book?

00:41:47.150 --> 00:41:49.000
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: Or creating a
drawing or just making it.

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:51.170
&gt;&gt; DEB TAYLOR: Creative
challenges did you face.

00:41:51.170 --> 00:41:52.910
&gt;&gt; SHADRA STRICKLAND: In
making the illustrations,

00:41:52.910 --> 00:41:56.560 position:56%
the hardest thing was sort of taking
this idea of visual journalism

00:41:56.560 --> 00:41:59.760
and applying it to history because
I've never done that before.

00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:02.340
All of my drawings prior
to had been very ...

00:42:02.340 --> 00:42:04.810
Can we advance the
slides a little bit?

00:42:04.810 --> 00:42:07.880
Had been very direct
and on the spot.

00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:09.180
Is there no one direct ...

00:42:09.180 --> 00:42:11.110
Okay, the slides aren't working.

00:42:11.110 --> 00:42:16.730
So, I think for me, the biggest
challenge was the research

00:42:16.730 --> 00:42:18.600
where Patricia had spent ...

00:42:18.600 --> 00:42:21.090
How long did you spend
researching the book?

00:42:21.090 --> 00:42:25.090
&gt;&gt; PATRICIA POWELL: About
an hour, an hour and a half.

00:42:25.090 --> 00:42:26.970
Change that hour to a year.

00:42:26.970 --> 00:42:28.270
&gt;&gt; SHADRA STRICKLAND: Right, right.

00:42:28.270 --> 00:42:29.570
&gt;&gt; PATRICIA POWELL: And a half.

00:42:29.570 --> 00:42:31.120
&gt;&gt; SHADRA STRICKLAND: So,
knowing that the author had spent

00:42:31.120 --> 00:42:35.080 position:56%
so much time researching the book,
and my deadline was a little tighter

00:42:35.080 --> 00:42:36.970
for making the illustrations,

00:42:36.970 --> 00:42:38.780
I didn't want to make
any mistakes, right?

00:42:38.780 --> 00:42:42.820
You can see in this slide,
my drawing process is instead

00:42:42.820 --> 00:42:45.940
of erasing mistakes, I
would just redraw it,

00:42:45.940 --> 00:42:47.660
so a lot of the drawings
I would do seven,

00:42:47.660 --> 00:42:50.460
eight times before I felt
like they were solid.

00:42:50.460 --> 00:42:55.060
I had to rely that YouTube clip
that we saw was a main source

00:42:55.060 --> 00:42:57.920
of inspiration for me even though
Mildred was a little older during

00:42:57.920 --> 00:43:03.560
that interview, but having to find
as many photographs as possible.

00:43:03.560 --> 00:43:05.240
This is a collection of photographs

00:43:05.240 --> 00:43:07.410
by a photojournalist
named Grey Villet.

00:43:07.410 --> 00:43:11.870
And he spent time with the
Lovings, taking these pictures

00:43:11.870 --> 00:43:15.110
so that they could run this ad
and this article in LIFE Magazine.

00:43:15.110 --> 00:43:17.150
This was invaluable for me.

00:43:17.150 --> 00:43:19.740
And I think that it's
important for us now

00:43:19.740 --> 00:43:25.440
as we are a very documentary
society where we are Instagramming

00:43:25.440 --> 00:43:27.670
and Facebooking and Twittering ...

00:43:27.670 --> 00:43:28.970
Twittering.

00:43:28.970 --> 00:43:30.270
I'm so old.

00:43:30.270 --> 00:43:31.570
&gt;&gt; DEB TAYLOR: Tweeting.

00:43:31.570 --> 00:43:32.870
&gt;&gt; PATRICIA POWELL: Tweeting.

00:43:32.870 --> 00:43:34.170
&gt;&gt; SHADRA STRICKLAND: Tweeting.

00:43:34.170 --> 00:43:35.470
Sorry, Tweeting.

00:43:35.470 --> 00:43:38.980
These things live on, and
generations after us will go back

00:43:38.980 --> 00:43:41.030
and use this information.

00:43:41.030 --> 00:43:43.950
I was grateful to have this
even though this wasn't done

00:43:43.950 --> 00:43:46.680
in the age of the internet.

00:43:46.680 --> 00:43:47.980
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:43:47.980 --> 00:43:50.110 position:56%
&gt;&gt; DEB TAYLOR: Just before that next
question, I just want to remind you

00:43:50.110 --> 00:43:53.980
that the book will be on sale in
the lobby at a discount price,

00:43:53.980 --> 00:43:57.570
so you will be able to purchase
copies of the book today.

00:43:57.570 --> 00:43:59.870
Another question?

00:44:01.940 --> 00:44:05.580
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: Obviously, for them,
it was a really long process

00:44:05.580 --> 00:44:09.430
of getting their whole case all
the way to the Supreme Court.

00:44:09.430 --> 00:44:12.610
When they moved, that
was hard for them,

00:44:12.610 --> 00:44:15.470
but why didn't they just move
somewhere that wasn't Washington,

00:44:15.470 --> 00:44:19.970
DC, somewhere that was more
inclusive but not in Virginia?

00:44:19.970 --> 00:44:24.110
Because I feel like it was such
a long, hard process for them

00:44:24.110 --> 00:44:26.100
that it was like, "Oh,
if we just leave

00:44:26.100 --> 00:44:30.520
and go somewhere that's
similar, it would be okay."

00:44:30.520 --> 00:44:31.820
Why do you think they-

00:44:31.820 --> 00:44:33.510
&gt;&gt; DEB TAYLOR: Why didn't
they leave Virginia and go?

00:44:33.510 --> 00:44:34.810
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: No.

00:44:34.810 --> 00:44:40.240
Why did they go to DC instead
of somewhere more similar

00:44:40.240 --> 00:44:42.790
to where they were coming from?

00:44:42.790 --> 00:44:46.120
&gt;&gt; PATRICIA POWELL: They wanted to
be as close to home as possible.

00:44:46.120 --> 00:44:50.470
In the nine years from the
time they were arrested in '58

00:44:50.470 --> 00:44:55.210
until it was decided in 1967 by
the Supreme Court, they came home.

00:44:55.210 --> 00:45:00.180
They were rearrested once on Easter
Sunday or the day before Easter.

00:45:00.180 --> 00:45:04.250
Then they snuck home from
time to time and stayed

00:45:04.250 --> 00:45:08.800
with her sister Garnet in
an adjoining county, in King

00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:11.340
and Queen County, or
Essex County, I believe,

00:45:11.340 --> 00:45:14.470
and so they were close to home.

00:45:14.470 --> 00:45:18.380
Eventually, they were
given a stay of ...

00:45:18.380 --> 00:45:24.820
&gt;&gt; ELIZABETH HAYES: Well, there
was a stay of their sentence,

00:45:24.820 --> 00:45:27.960
but the judge amended, the
second time amended the order

00:45:27.960 --> 00:45:30.150
so that they could go to Virginia.

00:45:30.150 --> 00:45:31.450
They couldn't cohabit.

00:45:31.450 --> 00:45:33.270
&gt;&gt; PATRICIA POWELL:
And at one point,

00:45:33.270 --> 00:45:38.500
they lived in an adjoining
county, King and Queen County,

00:45:38.500 --> 00:45:40.880
but they were supposed to lie
very low and keep their apartment

00:45:40.880 --> 00:45:44.580
in Washington, DC so they could
race home if there was any trouble.

00:45:44.580 --> 00:45:47.690
&gt;&gt; DEB TAYLOR: Of course,
these weren't wealthy people.

00:45:47.690 --> 00:45:52.210 position:56%
These weren't people with resources
to move and to move away from family

00:45:52.210 --> 00:45:55.870
where there was support
and what have you.

00:45:55.870 --> 00:45:59.150
They didn't have a lot
of educational background

00:45:59.150 --> 00:46:02.980 position:56%
to change jobs and to do all of the
things that we would think of today.

00:46:02.980 --> 00:46:04.460
&gt;&gt; ELIZABETH HAYES: Plus, I
believe they lived with one

00:46:04.460 --> 00:46:08.550
of Mildred's cousins, so that made
it possible as attractive as well.

00:46:08.550 --> 00:46:09.850
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:46:09.850 --> 00:46:11.260
&gt;&gt; DEB TAYLOR: We've
got another question?

00:46:11.260 --> 00:46:12.560
One over here?

00:46:12.560 --> 00:46:13.860
All right.

00:46:13.860 --> 00:46:15.710
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: You all kept
mentioning that if somebody

00:46:15.710 --> 00:46:18.650
like a white person was
one-16th African American,

00:46:18.650 --> 00:46:20.870
they weren't considered
white, correct?

00:46:20.870 --> 00:46:24.370
If he wasn't considered white or
if someone wasn't considered white

00:46:24.370 --> 00:46:25.730
and they would date a black woman,

00:46:25.730 --> 00:46:27.900
would it still be frowned
upon in society?

00:46:27.900 --> 00:46:30.670
Or if Richard Loving was
one-16th African American

00:46:30.670 --> 00:46:32.760
and wasn't considered white,

00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:34.250
would he have received
the same punishment?

00:46:34.250 --> 00:46:36.370
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: Do you understand?

00:46:36.370 --> 00:46:38.820
&gt;&gt; ELIZABETH HAYES: If
Richard had been ...

00:46:38.820 --> 00:46:43.360
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: If Richard had been
1/16th percent African American

00:46:43.360 --> 00:46:46.190
and not considered white and
he still married Mildred,

00:46:46.190 --> 00:46:47.630
would she still get
the same punishment?

00:46:47.630 --> 00:46:48.930
&gt;&gt; ELIZABETH HAYES: If
it wouldn't be a problem.

00:46:48.930 --> 00:46:51.330
They both would be
considered non-white.

00:46:51.330 --> 00:46:52.890
And that's the other thing,

00:46:52.890 --> 00:46:56.670
these laws that separated
whites from blacks.

00:46:56.670 --> 00:46:58.320
The fact of the matter
is from the beginning,

00:46:58.320 --> 00:47:00.560
this country hasn't just
been white and black.

00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:01.860
There had been Latinos.

00:47:01.860 --> 00:47:03.160
There had been Asians.

00:47:03.160 --> 00:47:06.950
So, one of the requirements
when you start having laws

00:47:06.950 --> 00:47:08.410
that separate people to white

00:47:08.410 --> 00:47:11.300
and black is how do
you characterize people

00:47:11.300 --> 00:47:13.580
who are neither white nor black?

00:47:13.580 --> 00:47:15.860
You have to fit them
into these categories.

00:47:15.860 --> 00:47:20.550
&gt;&gt; PATRICIA POWELL: In fact,
if you were Native American

00:47:20.550 --> 00:47:25.350
in Virginia during that, between
'24 and '67, you were colored

00:47:25.350 --> 00:47:29.300
because you were not white, unless
you lived on the reservation.

00:47:29.300 --> 00:47:32.700
That's the only way you could
have your Native American status.

00:47:32.700 --> 00:47:34.650
&gt;&gt; SHADRA STRICKLAND: But,
even the idea of one-16th,

00:47:34.650 --> 00:47:37.510
how can you even determine
that, right?

00:47:37.510 --> 00:47:40.520
Richard, constituently, if he
were one-16th African American

00:47:40.520 --> 00:47:43.240
or one-16th Native American, he
still potentially would have looked

00:47:43.240 --> 00:47:48.590 position:56%
like he was a pure Caucasian man and
they probably still would have had

00:47:48.590 --> 00:47:50.550
to go through what
they went through.

00:47:50.550 --> 00:47:53.430
Unless they did a DNA test which
wouldn't happen back then ...

00:47:53.430 --> 00:47:56.590
There's still not really
a way to prove that.

00:47:56.590 --> 00:47:58.560 position:56%
&gt;&gt; DEB TAYLOR: A question over here?

00:47:58.560 --> 00:48:01.300 position:56%
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: As opposed to all other
court cases throughout history,

00:48:01.300 --> 00:48:05.110
why choose this one to write about?

00:48:05.110 --> 00:48:08.580
&gt;&gt; DEB TAYLOR: With all of the
legal cases that there were,

00:48:08.580 --> 00:48:11.270
racially-based legal
cases, why this one?

00:48:11.270 --> 00:48:14.360
Why did this one compel
you more than many others?

00:48:14.360 --> 00:48:15.690
&gt;&gt; PATRICIA POWELL: As the author?

00:48:15.690 --> 00:48:17.230
Well, it's the one that won.

00:48:17.230 --> 00:48:20.180
I mean, of all civil rights cases?

00:48:20.180 --> 00:48:23.100 position:56%
As I said before, it's a love story.

00:48:23.100 --> 00:48:25.730
I had never written
a love story before.

00:48:25.730 --> 00:48:27.400
I wanted to write it for teenagers.

00:48:27.400 --> 00:48:30.190
I'm a children's and
young adult author,

00:48:30.190 --> 00:48:32.730
and I think love is interesting.

00:48:32.730 --> 00:48:37.450
I got to do research, what I
consider research, about love.

00:48:37.450 --> 00:48:41.190
I talk to my husband a whole
lot about our falling in love,

00:48:41.190 --> 00:48:46.730
but I also listen to music that
I listen to when I was in my 20s,

00:48:46.730 --> 00:48:49.660
when I was falling
in love frequently.

00:48:49.660 --> 00:48:51.270
And I loved writing the scene

00:48:51.270 --> 00:48:53.770
for which Shadra showed
you the illustration

00:48:53.770 --> 00:48:55.070
of them running through the woods.

00:48:55.070 --> 00:48:57.580
I find it the most
incredibly romantic.

00:48:57.580 --> 00:49:01.190
It's several pages long,
but it's very quick

00:49:01.190 --> 00:49:02.490
and they never say a word.

00:49:02.490 --> 00:49:04.920
They just go out in the
middle of the night,

00:49:04.920 --> 00:49:07.260
she sneaks out, and
they run together.

00:49:07.260 --> 00:49:08.580
Whoo! That's pretty cool.

00:49:08.580 --> 00:49:12.990
&gt;&gt; DEB TAYLOR: We've got
a question back here?

00:49:12.990 --> 00:49:14.870
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: What was your motive

00:49:14.870 --> 00:49:19.080
for choosing this love story
instead of other love stories?

00:49:19.080 --> 00:49:20.380
&gt;&gt; DEB TAYLOR: Why this love story,

00:49:20.380 --> 00:49:22.300
since you wanted to
write a love story?

00:49:22.300 --> 00:49:23.600
&gt;&gt; PATRICIA POWELL:
Well, because this ...

00:49:23.600 --> 00:49:24.900
Well, okay.

00:49:24.900 --> 00:49:27.290
I could say in general,
it's very attractive.

00:49:27.290 --> 00:49:31.140
It's very compelling because
it is a civil rights story.

00:49:31.140 --> 00:49:32.800
I just finished writing Josephine:

00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:34.950
The Dazzling Life of
Josephine Baker.

00:49:34.950 --> 00:49:38.190
Actually, I've written it ages
ago, but it was in production.

00:49:38.190 --> 00:49:42.050
And she was not only an African
American dancer who made it huge

00:49:42.050 --> 00:49:45.490
in Paris in the '20s,
although she was American,

00:49:45.490 --> 00:49:47.580
she could not be a
superstar in this country,

00:49:47.580 --> 00:49:50.060
and she was also a
civil rights worker.

00:49:50.060 --> 00:49:54.520
So, Chronicle Books knew that I
was interested in civil rights,

00:49:54.520 --> 00:50:00.010
and Ginee Seo, our
publisher at Chronicle Books,

00:50:00.010 --> 00:50:02.210
asked me if I was interested

00:50:02.210 --> 00:50:05.520
in writing this story,
and I absolutely was.

00:50:05.520 --> 00:50:09.500
And I really just have to give a
huge shout-out to Melissa Manlove,

00:50:09.500 --> 00:50:16.560 position:56%
my editor, who just had a vision for
this book that really has so much

00:50:16.560 --> 00:50:19.530
to do with why this book
looks the way it does.

00:50:19.530 --> 00:50:22.120
Also, Jennifer Tolo
Pierce, our designer.

00:50:22.120 --> 00:50:25.210
It's sort of an interesting
thing that the way Shadra

00:50:25.210 --> 00:50:28.820
and I communicate while we
were making the book is I talk

00:50:28.820 --> 00:50:33.080
to Melissa, my editor, Melissa
talks to Jennifer, the designer,

00:50:33.080 --> 00:50:36.720
the designer talks to Shadra, and
then they go, "Doot, doot, doot,

00:50:36.720 --> 00:50:38.020
doot, doot, doot," back again.

00:50:38.020 --> 00:50:40.130
&gt;&gt; SHADRA STRICKLAND: We didn't
actually meet until March

00:50:40.130 --> 00:50:42.200
of this year after
the book came out,

00:50:42.200 --> 00:50:44.430
but that's how it goes
in publishing.

00:50:44.430 --> 00:50:45.730
&gt;&gt; DEB TAYLOR: Wow.

00:50:45.730 --> 00:50:47.590
We've got time for
one more question.

00:50:47.590 --> 00:50:49.610
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: If the movie was
already out, why did you feel

00:50:49.610 --> 00:50:51.830
like you had to write a
book about it as opposed

00:50:51.830 --> 00:50:53.560
to just watching the movie?

00:50:53.560 --> 00:50:56.110 position:56%
&gt;&gt; PATRICIA POWELL: I wrote the
book long before the movie came out.

00:50:56.110 --> 00:51:01.210
I started the book, I'm trying
to remember, it was 2012.

00:51:01.210 --> 00:51:03.390
I think it was 2012.

00:51:03.390 --> 00:51:07.280
First of all, it was
supposed to come out in 2015,

00:51:07.280 --> 00:51:11.720
then it was supposed to come
out in 2016, and then it came

00:51:11.720 --> 00:51:16.210
out in January 31st of
2017, so there was a world

00:51:16.210 --> 00:51:19.590
in which it would have come
out earlier than the movie.

00:51:19.590 --> 00:51:26.300
The things that hold it back
are things like a designer quit

00:51:26.300 --> 00:51:30.140
at Chronicle, and Jennifer
Tolo Pierce, our designer,

00:51:30.140 --> 00:51:33.980
had to take over a whole lot
of everybody else's work.

00:51:33.980 --> 00:51:39.030 position:56%
I don't know what else held it back,
but now it's the 50th anniversary

00:51:39.030 --> 00:51:44.770
of the judgment, the US Supreme
judgment from 1967 to 2017,

00:51:44.770 --> 00:51:47.140
so it's kind of poetic
that way, right?

00:51:47.140 --> 00:51:48.470
&gt;&gt; DEB TAYLOR: Then very often,

00:51:48.470 --> 00:51:53.160
when there is a historic milestone
commemoration, we will have a book,

00:51:53.160 --> 00:51:58.270
we'll have movies, we'll have
TV shows, we'll have lots

00:51:58.270 --> 00:52:00.540
of discussions, so it's
not just one piece of media

00:52:00.540 --> 00:52:05.190
that can address a story
because we receive these stories

00:52:05.190 --> 00:52:07.150
in so many different formats.

00:52:07.150 --> 00:52:10.590
Well, I just want to
thank my esteemed panel

00:52:10.590 --> 00:52:13.240
who did an awesome job.

00:52:24.370 --> 00:52:25.670
&gt;&gt; PATRICIA POWELL: Thank you.

00:52:25.670 --> 00:52:26.970
&gt;&gt; SHADRA STRICKLAND: Thank you.

00:52:26.970 --> 00:52:28.270
Thanks, Deborah.

00:52:28.270 --> 00:52:29.570
[applause]

00:52:29.570 --> 00:52:30.870
&gt;&gt; DEB TAYLOR: I want to
thank the Young Readers Center

00:52:30.870 --> 00:52:32.170
for organizing today's event,
and all of the volunteers and all

00:52:32.170 --> 00:52:35.780
of the staff who really put things
together for us and who work

00:52:35.780 --> 00:52:39.240
to make sure and to thank you
for your wonderful questions

00:52:39.240 --> 00:52:40.830
and your wonderful contribution.

00:52:40.830 --> 00:52:44.100
So, we hope that you will have
a chance to read this book

00:52:44.100 --> 00:52:49.030
and see the wonderful change that
it made in our country's history.

00:53:06.480 --> 00:53:12.330
So, thank you all very much.

00:53:12.330 --> 00:53:14.700
[applause]

00:53:14.700 --> 00:53:18.140
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
