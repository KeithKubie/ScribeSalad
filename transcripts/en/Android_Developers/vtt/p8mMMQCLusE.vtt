00:00:02.175 --> 00:00:05.040
SPEAKER 1: I run this team of--

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.039
I like to think of them
as persuasion scientists--

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:10.830
at "The Wall Street Journal,"
at Dow Jones more broadly.

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.322
And if you go to wsj.com,
or you go to our apps,

00:00:13.322 --> 00:00:15.780
if you go to barrons.com, if
you go to the "Barron's" apps,

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.265
you're probably in an
experiment that we're running.

00:00:19.265 --> 00:00:21.390
And I've been doing this
for about three years now.

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:22.920
The team started
with about two of us.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:23.795
Now we're up to five.

00:00:23.795 --> 00:00:25.770
We're hiring a couple
more people next year.

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:27.810
It's obviously just
been really fun.

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.200
Testing is-- if you're unsure of
it-- testing is really, really

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:31.920
fun.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.190
It's extremely validating.

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.520
You just get this
immediate gratification

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.800
and there's just this
beautiful customer feedback

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.383
loop that you're
basically just trying

00:00:39.383 --> 00:00:43.150
to harness and interpret.

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:45.360
So where do we test?

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.640
And what do we test for?

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.360
Back in 2015, the
subscription business

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.130
essentially went through
a digital transformation.

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:56.220
They said, we need to
kind of rejigger things

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:01.980
and set ourselves up
for more digital growth.

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.690
And so there are a
number of changes.

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:07.350
One of them was that they
made this little team.

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.470
And they said, here's some
money and go do some testing.

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.960
And that's about all
the guidance we had

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.160
and that's about all we needed.

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:20.490
But the best place to start any
testing experimentation program

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.440
is on the acquisition side.

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.040
It's really difficult
to screw up your results

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.125
or to not figure out when
you did something good.

00:01:28.125 --> 00:01:32.670
More orders, more money
is usually a good thing.

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.280
So we spent more than
a year just focused

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.880
on solving for acquisition.

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.820
But of course, then we
realized testing is something

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.420
that all you really need is
you need a digital moment.

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:45.780
You need lots of traffic.

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.446
And you need to know what
you want people to do.

00:01:48.446 --> 00:01:50.820
So you could basically apply
it to any digital experience

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.890
as long as you've got all
those things lined up.

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.460
So we moved up the funnel
onto the editorial site,

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.620
but for people who
were unsubscribed.

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:02.250
So trying to change that
experience and optimize that

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.400
experience so we could
increase the conversion

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:06.631
rate from content.

00:02:06.631 --> 00:02:08.130
And then also moving
down the funnel

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.340
where obviously all of you
guys are extremely well

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.380
aware that onboarding is a
critical moment where you can

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.830
really sort of set up
your members, your users,

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.950
for success or for failure.

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.439
And again, we've pushed
out again in 2018.

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:27.480
We've partnered with the
core product team, which

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.450
is sort of the stewards of just
what it means to consume "Wall

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.430
Street Journal" content.

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.680
So we're solving just for real
kind of true product KPIs.

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.572
We're going to add some more--

00:02:38.572 --> 00:02:40.280
we're teaming up with
the retention team.

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:41.988
We're teaming up with
the education team.

00:02:41.988 --> 00:02:44.160
So we're just kind of
getting our tendrils out

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.520
across the business, where there
is sort of the stakeholder, who

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.300
has the real ownership of the
real estate or the business

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:52.050
outcome.

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.840
And we try to facilitate
them achieving that by--

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.784
because we become experts at the
discipline of experimentation.

00:02:59.784 --> 00:03:01.950
Another way to look at it
is you look at the metrics

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.283
that we're actually solving for.

00:03:03.283 --> 00:03:04.635
They've obviously exploded.

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:08.870
So how do we choose
what to test?

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:10.530
Now I don't know--

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.460
in this room, would you guys--

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:19.630
who here isn't doing any
AB multivariate testing?

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:20.620
Great.

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.820
Who feels like they're
just starting out?

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:25.900
OK.

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.970
So we're in-- we're
further along the curve.

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:33.920
Regardless of where you
are, these three slides,

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.820
I think, are the most important
slides in terms of, I think,

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:38.530
driving the success
that we've seen.

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:43.390
The first thing is that we--

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:46.510
three years in-- we are
still obsessively hunting

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:47.740
the low-hanging fruit.

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:52.210
There is this thing that happens
where once businesses become

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:54.640
committed to making
data-driven decisions,

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.730
they often over-rotate
towards making things

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:00.164
really complicated and
really fancy really soon,

00:04:00.164 --> 00:04:02.205
because if it's fancier
and it's more complicated

00:04:02.205 --> 00:04:05.590
and it seems harder,
it seems better.

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:07.810
But in fact, business
is difficult.

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:09.580
So any time things
are easy, you want

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:11.475
to hold on for all it's worth.

00:04:11.475 --> 00:04:13.600
And I think there's been
this sort of misconception

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:17.690
where the active segmenting
and personalizing experiences,

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:20.380
that's what represents the
biggest upside when it comes

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:25.030
to experimentation
and just manipulating

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:28.570
digital experiences, when
in fact, what we've found

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:34.000
is that the "one size fits all"
learnings-- basic navigation,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.527
basic design, evergreen
copy that always wins,

00:04:37.527 --> 00:04:39.860
that's the low-hanging fruit
that's sitting right there.

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:43.240
And that actually represents,
at minimum, 50% of the upside.

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.610
Whereas things like
segment-based experiences,

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:47.530
all of those have to
work a lot harder, right?

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:50.170
So for example, in
my case, if I have

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:52.960
some theory about how I
could speak to people coming

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:58.210
from opinion content and
I run a test, a 10% uplift

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:00.980
on just people coming
from opinion traffic

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:04.466
has got to work 10 times as
hard as a 10% uplift that

00:05:04.466 --> 00:05:07.090
applies to every man, woman, and
child who's considering buying

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:08.560
"The Wall Street Journal."

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:11.655
So that really has, I think,
been a pretty important driver

00:05:11.655 --> 00:05:12.280
of our success.

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:14.320
And then you've got
personalization up here.

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.040
Again, there's plenty
of upside there,

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:19.570
but just if you skip
out on this stuff,

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:22.874
you're just making it
harder on yourself.

00:05:22.874 --> 00:05:25.040
And as I said, we've been
doing this for three years

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:27.550
and we're still finding
big "one size fits all,"

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:29.783
really stupid simple learnings.

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.880
So the second thing that I think
has really sort of informed

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:39.060
our strategy is best summed
up by this great quote

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:40.710
from van Gogh.

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:43.701
"Small emotions are the
great captains of our lives."

00:05:43.701 --> 00:05:45.450
And obviously he'd be
rolling in his grave

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:47.940
if he knew we were talking
and using it in this context.

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:50.702
But he's not around, so
we're going to proceed.

00:05:50.702 --> 00:05:51.837
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:51.837 --> 00:05:52.920
What you're going to see--

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:56.700
and the test that I've
selected to show you guys,

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:59.940
you're going to be blown
away by the dramatic impact

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:04.660
these subtle, subtle
changes have had.

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:07.620
And I think that the
two takeaways in it

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:09.930
are, one, that you're
probably-- there's probably

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:12.134
a lot of upside just
lying in plain sight

00:06:12.134 --> 00:06:14.550
really close at hand where you
don't have to do that much.

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:17.060
You don't have to
build a new feature.

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:19.230
You just can try to
manipulate the experience

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:23.502
as it is in terms of how it's
presented, so on and so forth.

00:06:23.502 --> 00:06:24.960
And the second, it
should also give

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:27.060
you pause any time you
make a change that you

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:31.500
deem to be large and assume that
you know it's going to be good.

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:33.750
Because if they're sensitive
to things like this, then

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:35.060
anything that's
bigger than that,

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:36.600
they're definitely
going to be sensitive.

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:37.950
And you might have got it wrong.

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:40.020
So we try to test
absolutely everything

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:44.160
before it launches, regardless
of whether it's large or small.

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:46.475
The last thing that has been
sort of surprising to us

00:06:46.475 --> 00:06:47.850
is I think when
you find yourself

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:51.840
in a less imaginative
place, testing

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:56.790
tends to steer itself
towards price and feature.

00:06:56.790 --> 00:07:00.150
Now, obviously those are
big, very powerful levers,

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:04.470
because you're actually changing
the nature of the proposition.

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:08.460
But especially on the feature
side, that stuff is expensive.

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:10.470
What we've found is
that the vast majority

00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:12.480
of the successes
we've had have been

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:14.490
making very, very simple
and very inexpensive

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:17.100
changes to copy and design,
which, as you can see,

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:21.630
is sort of the three buckets
more on the right side.

00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:26.880
So again, this leads us
back to this instinct

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:30.630
where there's just a lot of
upside just in the window

00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:34.440
dressing, and not in
the meat on the bones.

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:36.905
And if you can just create
value essentially out of nothing

00:07:36.905 --> 00:07:39.030
just by how you position
the product without having

00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:41.220
to make any improvement
to the product itself,

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:46.060
that's just the easiest money
you're ever going to get.

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:47.560
Who cares?

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:51.040
So how does an experimentation
team establish its own value?

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:53.560
Some places, you've
got product managers

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:56.050
who are managing sort of the
core product [? movement ?]

00:07:56.050 --> 00:07:56.800
and also testing.

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:58.883
In our case, we sort of
have this standalone unit.

00:07:58.883 --> 00:08:00.810
So we really want to
make sure everybody knows

00:08:00.810 --> 00:08:02.770
if we're doing a good job.

00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:05.620
So how does a testing
group establish its value?

00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:06.790
They run a test.

00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:08.860
So on the acquisition
side of things,

00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:10.909
we actually recreated
the experience

00:08:10.909 --> 00:08:12.700
of subscribing to "The
Wall Street Journal"

00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:16.816
back when we began and AB tested
it against-- the experience

00:08:16.816 --> 00:08:19.190
is a little bit dated, but
the experience you have today,

00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:24.480
which is essentially the sum
total of all of our learnings.

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:27.590
There's a 64% conversion uplift.

00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:30.124
And actually when you
break it out by device,

00:08:30.124 --> 00:08:31.290
the numbers are much higher.

00:08:31.290 --> 00:08:33.740
The reason why the blended
number drops to 64%

00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:36.919
is that mobile traffic, the
ratio of mobile to desktop

00:08:36.919 --> 00:08:39.740
traffic has dramatically shifted
and the conversion rate is just

00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:44.700
significantly lower on mobile,
even though we've moved it up.

00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:47.744
So there's nothing
wrong with that.

00:08:47.744 --> 00:08:49.410
So I'm going to roll
into some examples.

00:08:49.410 --> 00:08:52.050
Again, think about
low-hanging fruit.

00:08:52.050 --> 00:08:53.520
I think there's
all these examples

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:55.870
are consistent in that
they are low-hanging fruit

00:08:55.870 --> 00:08:58.380
and that they were restarted
with something relatively

00:08:58.380 --> 00:08:58.880
subtle.

00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:04.650
On the acquisition
side, cut the fat.

00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:06.210
Add a little color.

00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:08.400
Tell people what you
thought they already knew.

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:10.270
Time and place.

00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:11.830
So cutting the fat.

00:09:11.830 --> 00:09:14.682
The first thing
that we did was not

00:09:14.682 --> 00:09:16.890
to have an idea about what
we should add to anything.

00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:18.390
There's a great
Saint-Exupery quote,

00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:21.335
which is, "the designer knows
he's done not when there's

00:09:21.335 --> 00:09:22.710
anything to add,
but when there's

00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:24.270
nothing left to take away."

00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:25.500
So the first thing
we said is, let's not

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:27.390
assume we have any good ideas
about what we should add

00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:28.470
to any of these experiences.

00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:30.178
Let's look at what we
can cut, especially

00:09:30.178 --> 00:09:31.980
when it comes to forms.

00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:34.770
So this was the
checkout when we began.

00:09:34.770 --> 00:09:37.410
It took what, about one
minute to complete it when

00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:38.970
you went as fast you could.

00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:44.670
We cut about 25% just of
the field you had to enter.

00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:45.480
That's pure upside.

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:46.290
You didn't change the product.

00:09:46.290 --> 00:09:47.130
You didn't do anything.

00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:48.588
There's some heavy
lifting involved

00:09:48.588 --> 00:09:50.100
in terms of some
back-end systems,

00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:51.810
but you didn't have
to be particularly

00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:55.222
imaginative to generate
value for your business

00:09:55.222 --> 00:09:56.430
by experimenting in this way.

00:09:58.722 --> 00:09:59.930
Adding a little color, right?

00:09:59.930 --> 00:10:02.695
So this was the
page that you saw

00:10:02.695 --> 00:10:05.070
when you downloaded "The Wall
Street Journal" Android app

00:10:05.070 --> 00:10:08.820
on first open when we
began testing in it.

00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:11.460
And it occurred to us that this
sort of "gray on gray on gray"

00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:13.837
illustration wasn't
necessarily doing

00:10:13.837 --> 00:10:16.170
the best job of painting the
picture of the wonders that

00:10:16.170 --> 00:10:18.503
awaited you on the other side
of a "Wall Street Journal"

00:10:18.503 --> 00:10:19.960
subscription.

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:21.780
So we just went to the
marketing department

00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:24.900
and we said, could you give
us a colorized pack shot?

00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:26.372
Let's not assume
we know anything.

00:10:26.372 --> 00:10:27.330
Let's not add any copy.

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:30.860
Let's change one
variable a time.

00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:34.080
There was a 110% order uplift.

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:36.040
So just put a little
spin on the ball.

00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:37.050
Give it a little pop.

00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:39.114
See what happens.

00:10:39.114 --> 00:10:40.530
This is a really
interesting test.

00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:43.560
So again, this is maybe
one of my favorites,

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:45.555
because you've got--

00:10:45.555 --> 00:10:48.900
To the left, you've got
an article roadblock.

00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:53.460
And on your right, you've got
the header of our shop page.

00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:57.270
Now we've been doing
a really good job

00:10:57.270 --> 00:10:59.250
of growing the
subscription business

00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:00.815
in the last couple of years.

00:11:00.815 --> 00:11:02.190
And one of the
components of that

00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:03.630
has been sort of
a campaign based

00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:06.027
model, where every month
there is a new look and feel.

00:11:06.027 --> 00:11:07.110
There's a new price point.

00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:08.307
There's a new message.

00:11:08.307 --> 00:11:10.890
There's always a party down at
"The Wall Street Journal" store

00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:12.120
effectively, right?

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:13.800
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:15.820
And it's been part
of our success.

00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:19.110
But a couple of years in,
we started to ask ourselves,

00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:22.287
if there's ever a product
that has perennial value,

00:11:22.287 --> 00:11:24.870
timeless value, it's a product
like "The Wall Street Journal."

00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:27.300
So maybe there's something
we could say in this moment

00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:29.216
where someone's coming
from a piece of content

00:11:29.216 --> 00:11:34.080
into a subscription
purchase decision that

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:38.830
could beat timely messages like
this every day of the year.

00:11:38.830 --> 00:11:41.544
So we tried a lot
of different things.

00:11:41.544 --> 00:11:42.960
So all these tests
for the record,

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:44.010
there are lots of variations.

00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:45.385
I'm just showing
you the one that

00:11:45.385 --> 00:11:46.770
won for the purposes of time.

00:11:46.770 --> 00:11:49.110
But we have run lots
of tests that lose.

00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:50.900
This is not my attempt
at a victory lap.

00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:53.160
We run lots of tests that lose,
and then within tests that win,

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:54.993
there are lots of
variations that also lose.

00:11:54.993 --> 00:11:57.077
But one of the things
we tried was we

00:11:57.077 --> 00:11:59.160
tried to think of the
dumbest, simplest, stupidest

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:00.826
thing we could say
in this moment, which

00:12:00.826 --> 00:12:02.460
feels like a huge
waste of time, right?

00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:03.510
This is your moment.

00:12:03.510 --> 00:12:05.880
I mean, we burned all
this marketing real estate

00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:08.370
to tell people something which
should be patently obvious,

00:12:08.370 --> 00:12:09.870
because they just
clicked an article

00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:13.380
and they just got this big blue
thing that's in the way of it.

00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:15.300
But we repeated ourselves,
or so we thought.

00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:19.080
Continue reading your article
with a "WSJ" membership.

00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:23.250
That was a 37% order
uplift from articles.

00:12:23.250 --> 00:12:28.560
So just trying to come up with
the simplest customer empathy

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:32.760
and working back from there.

00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:33.410
Time and place.

00:12:33.410 --> 00:12:36.480
So for time immemorial,
"The Wall Street Journal"

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:40.415
has had a CTA strategy-- the
words that sit on our buttons

00:12:40.415 --> 00:12:42.540
at every point in the
acquisition funnel that said,

00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:43.800
join now and act now.

00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:46.490
Now obviously, we just had
another chance to test it.

00:12:46.490 --> 00:12:50.100
We know that an ad on social
or an article roadblock

00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:51.810
or a shop page or
a checkout flow

00:12:51.810 --> 00:12:54.270
are all very, very different
psychological moments.

00:12:54.270 --> 00:12:59.290
So we started to dig
into that premise.

00:12:59.290 --> 00:13:00.870
So this is an article roadblock.

00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:02.640
So at that point,
what's actually happened

00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:05.189
is they've actually
expressed no interest

00:13:05.189 --> 00:13:07.480
in subscribing to "The Wall
Street Journal" whatsoever.

00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:09.688
All they did was they say
they wanted to read article

00:13:09.688 --> 00:13:12.460
and they found out that they
couldn't unless they paid us.

00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:14.910
So we thought in this
moment, we're not actually--

00:13:14.910 --> 00:13:18.467
we don't want implicit enjoin
or implicit enact is the effort

00:13:18.467 --> 00:13:20.550
of filling out a form and
the pain of parting with

00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:21.509
your hard-earned cash--

00:13:21.509 --> 00:13:23.133
When in fact, all
you really want to do

00:13:23.133 --> 00:13:25.050
is we want you to do
something that should be

00:13:25.050 --> 00:13:27.589
fun, which is to window shop.

00:13:27.589 --> 00:13:29.130
We just want you to
come in the store

00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:31.379
and poke around, see if
something makes sense for you.

00:13:31.379 --> 00:13:33.990
So we soften the language
to view membership options.

00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:39.240
That was an 18% order
uplift from content.

00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:42.440
Again, simple, simple, simple.

00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:45.200
On the engagement side,
we also had some fun wins.

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:46.662
I had to cut these for time.

00:13:46.662 --> 00:13:48.870
I also, for the record,
these timers are not working,

00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:52.620
so I have no idea where I'm at.

00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:54.440
Cool.

00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:55.980
Make sure the pipes
are connected.

00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:58.814
Again, I think one thing
we're really good at

00:13:58.814 --> 00:14:00.230
is just taking the
same experience

00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:02.060
and just staring at it
over and over again,

00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:04.550
turning it on its side,
turning it on its side,

00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:08.060
relentlessly re-analyzing and
re-imagining these moments

00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:10.160
that we know are sort of
critical choke points,

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:13.219
either in the concept of
acquisition or engagement.

00:14:13.219 --> 00:14:14.510
Make them eat their vegetables.

00:14:14.510 --> 00:14:15.920
If there are good
things that you know--

00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:18.440
if there are things that you
know will make people happy,

00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:22.580
its worth trying to
force it on them--

00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:24.200
within reason.

00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:27.180
So when it came to the
world of engagement,

00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:28.790
we write-- unlike
acquisitions, it's

00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:31.580
a little bit harder to figure
out what you want anyone to do.

00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:34.121
There's all these-- you know,
clearly doing stuff in your app

00:14:34.121 --> 00:14:37.710
or on your website is usually
not a sign of bad engagement.

00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:39.390
It is, by definition,
engagement.

00:14:39.390 --> 00:14:41.390
But in our case from a
subscription perspective,

00:14:41.390 --> 00:14:44.180
we wanted to make sure we were
a little bit more laser-focused.

00:14:44.180 --> 00:14:47.690
So we realize the
only engagement metric

00:14:47.690 --> 00:14:49.660
that really mattered
was, if they do it,

00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:51.440
do they stay longer?

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:54.567
We need that correlation
between longer tenure for us

00:14:54.567 --> 00:14:56.150
to be willing to
spend air time trying

00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:58.970
to get anyone to do something.

00:14:58.970 --> 00:15:01.340
And a couple of
things really popped.

00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:06.290
So newsletter sign-ups, if you
have a group of new subscribers

00:15:06.290 --> 00:15:08.000
who sign up for a
newsletter compared

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.550
to a group of subscribers
who don't, nine months later,

00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:12.860
you'll have 15% more of
them if they did that.

00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:15.030
And obviously on
the usage of the app

00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:19.820
in addition to the website is
an even more surprising number.

00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:24.680
So now we've kind of got our
compass points ready to go.

00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:26.960
So one thing that's
interesting is

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:31.850
that 80% of our orders on
wsj.com come on desktop.

00:15:31.850 --> 00:15:34.010
The conversion rate
is so much higher.

00:15:34.010 --> 00:15:36.630
Actually the traffic
ratio is much more even,

00:15:36.630 --> 00:15:39.140
but the end result is
much higher on desktop

00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:43.880
because the conversion rate
just is significantly higher up.

00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:47.570
So how do you get someone
on a desktop computer

00:15:47.570 --> 00:15:50.480
to download an app and
to know that they did it?

00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:52.800
Now the Android
store, the Play Store,

00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:55.760
does have a good
solution around this.

00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:56.930
The iOS store doesn't.

00:15:56.930 --> 00:15:59.660
Our users tend to
skew a little bit more

00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:01.590
on the iOS side of things.

00:16:01.590 --> 00:16:04.220
So we've got this problem
where we figured out

00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:06.860
the one thing we want
them to do desperately,

00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:10.730
and for 80% of them, we'll never
really know if they did it.

00:16:10.730 --> 00:16:14.270
So you've got this sort
of connection problem.

00:16:14.270 --> 00:16:16.907
So all we did is we
added a little link text.

00:16:16.907 --> 00:16:18.865
There's this little link
texting functionality.

00:16:18.865 --> 00:16:21.432
It's silly, silly stuff.

00:16:21.432 --> 00:16:22.640
Enter your cell phone number.

00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:24.599
It immediately-- we
don't keep the number.

00:16:24.599 --> 00:16:25.640
We immediately delete it.

00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:27.556
We send you a text which
senses whether you've

00:16:27.556 --> 00:16:29.540
got an iOS or an Android
device and sends you

00:16:29.540 --> 00:16:32.760
a link to the appropriate app.

00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:35.750
That was a 95% lift in app
downloads on onboarding.

00:16:35.750 --> 00:16:36.560
Absolutely nuts.

00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:39.190
Just again, just trying
to approach things

00:16:39.190 --> 00:16:41.880
in a very, very simple way.

00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:45.860
The next thing we did with our
onboarding was our onboarding

00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:48.470
historically was a single
sort of static page.

00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:52.040
And we realized they just
came from a checkout, which

00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:54.530
is mandatory obviously,
and card-based.

00:16:54.530 --> 00:16:56.960
So we wondered, could we
psychologically leverage

00:16:56.960 --> 00:16:58.840
this experience going
into onboarding where

00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:00.500
the stuff that we really
would love to do--

00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:02.570
and we know they're going to
value our product a lot more.

00:17:02.570 --> 00:17:05.040
They're going to get much more
out of it if they actually

00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:06.720
do perform these actions.

00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:11.177
So we wondered if we could
leverage that experience

00:17:11.177 --> 00:17:12.260
once we got to onboarding.

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:14.940
So we turned onboarding into
a card-based experience.

00:17:14.940 --> 00:17:16.398
So the most important
thing it does

00:17:16.398 --> 00:17:20.180
is it focused them in on
one experience at a time.

00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:22.220
So their attention
was not divided

00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:23.599
between the four things.

00:17:23.599 --> 00:17:26.180
And we obviously were able
to prioritize them in order

00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:29.790
of benefit to them and to us.

00:17:29.790 --> 00:17:32.690
But the second thing is just
because it looked card-based

00:17:32.690 --> 00:17:36.230
and it looked like the checkout,
it just felt just mandatory

00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:39.200
enough, even though there's a
very large skip and continue

00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:43.280
button on any of them, that
we were able to really get

00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:44.000
really--

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.624
dramatically increase
the rate at which

00:17:45.624 --> 00:17:48.560
they're doing all these
things, which just enhances

00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:56.590
the value of the subscription
they just decided to purchase.

00:17:56.590 --> 00:17:58.630
And I think that's
about all I got.

00:17:58.630 --> 00:18:02.280
