00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.010
Okay, what's up? Guys? I'm Grant Thompson. The King of Random

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.329
And I'm Nate the Jack of Trades. For some reason Fortnite seems to be taking over the world right now

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:07.620
We've seen so many comments from you

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.179
Asking for us to do something with Slurp Juice, so we're out here today to do exactly that but first of all Nate

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:13.650
What exactly is slurp juice?

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.599
I'm not really sure what slurp juice is

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.499
But I know that it's blue and it glows and I think it's used for healing in the game

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.799
Glowing and blue. I think we could probably arrange some kind of concoction to meet those conditions.

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:30.519
I traveled to

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:37.828
8 dollar stores, buying all of the blue, yellow, orange, and magenta glow sticks that they have all of you basically bought them completely out and

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.488
The basic idea is we're gonna cut off the tops of these we're gonna separate the two liquids

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.648
And then just before we go to shoot these things

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:49.288
We're gonna mix them together to get them glowing brightly and then pressurize it in the canister and let it fly. Let's dive right in

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:56.780
Grant-Trick or Treat.

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:57.596
Nate-What a good treat?

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.260
Grant-It's just what I always wanted.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.260
Nate-A bunch of garbage

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:12.340
Right now I'm taking the glowsticks which are full of a fluid and a glass tube with a second fluid in it

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:17.740
I'm cutting the top off of the glow stick, pouring out one of the fluids, and the glass tube inside it

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.549
Putting that into a jar where I'm just gonna keep it all in one spot

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:24.039
Once I have so many that the glass tubes aren't fitting in the jar anymore

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:30.069
I will take those crack, them open with a pair of pliers and then pour the fluid in the glass tube into the other jar

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.200
It's not a very fast process

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:38.859
Oh dang it and just drop this one in and it broke (wow... great job lol)

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:42.669
You know what most of its still in there though, so it's a little bit contaminated

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:48.940
We are outside and not very bright, but we're still in sunlight you can't tell but this is now actually glowing a little bit

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:50.119
but the

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:56.799
activator doesn't get used up when it mixes with some of this glow stick fluid so the activator is still just perfectly good if we

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.269
Poured that into here, it would still make all of it glow quite a bit, which is the plan for later?

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:06.429
I actually had the exact same thing happened when I was draining out the yellow ones which is what our yellow activator

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:08.299
Is yellow instead of clear?

00:02:08.299 --> 00:02:14.100
This was clear and tell some dye got in it the yellow activator was clear until it got some dye in it. These things happen

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:15.640
Take a look at this guys

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.279
I finished cutting open all of the blue glowsticks and pouring the

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:22.869
Liquids into these two different containers this here is the activator which you can see is not contaminated

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:28.869
Nothing spilled in so this is what it should look like very clear very clear liquid now this over. Here is the dye which?

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:34.329
Surprisingly, also looks very clear this will start turning blue as soon as it combines with the activator

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:39.729
So we don't want to fill the fire extinguisher all the way full or there won't be really any room for the pressurized air in

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:40.510
There along with it

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.980
So we'll fill the fire extinguisher 60 to maybe 70% full right about it this mark

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:46.980
and that should take about

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.590
70% of both of our jars and that means we're not going to use all the food in these jars

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.590
Which means we get multiple rounds of ammunition?

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:08.170
As soon as we start pouring activator in we're gonna start getting a nice and blue glow I might just be coming up out of

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.170
the fire extinguisher

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:13.570
Whoo I can see it starting to glow all right

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:19.660
Yep, that looks cool. I mean look at that well. Just break for a second check that out. That's cool. Oh

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:22.749
That's a really nice color. Oh, it's getting brighter

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.600
all right four correct ratios

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:29.860
That looks awesome. I'm so great. Oh my goodness blue light

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:35.169
That is beautiful check this out check this out look down there isn't that the coolest color?

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:39.070
Glowing blue you've ever seen all right. Let's get this thing pressurized

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:41.500
You can see we put a Schrader valve on the side here

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.380
We can attach that to a bike pump and easily press up to 60 psi

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:54.039
Whoa there goes huh, it's shredded the Schrader. I got a backup. I'll be right back

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:58.870
There's our slurp juice

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.600
There we go, that was 60

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:07.839
All right our slurp shooter charged and ready to go test one. Let's do this. How's it gonna be awesome, okay?

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.429
So theoretically I just press down this lever right here, and it's gonna shoot out a glowing stream of slurp juice

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:14.430
Just let's see if that works in three oh

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:22.510
That is the coolest thing that he's got glowing fluid it just sticks to the wall

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:27.669
You could actually do like glowing graffiti with this thing you can have a glowing graffiti gun how about that?

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:32.739
I think that should be a new thing whoa look look the nozzle is even glowing if you look down in there

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:37.000
You can see a little blue light in the nozzle this just keeps getting better and better. Let's recharge

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:44.650
I'm gonna see if I can draw a little guy here. Oh

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:51.399
I'm losing pressure. Yeah, it's kind of cool. Though little glowing hieroglyphic

00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:57.399
Alright, let's add some ambience I

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:02.379
Love that it's like shotgun approach

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:05.709
All right, this is deviant art

00:05:07.099 --> 00:05:08.419
Yes

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:13.839
Yes, what I want to say. I want to say some kind of disclaimer, but nothing's coming to mind cuz you should totally do it

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:19.719
Well that was kind of cool Nate. What do you think I think that it's not the most precise way to paint

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:23.319
But it might be the most fun. It'll still be on the wall the blue. Dye

00:05:23.319 --> 00:05:26.229
If you remember doesn't really show up as blue unless it's being

00:05:26.449 --> 00:05:30.369
Activated by the activating chemical so once this one is dry

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:31.729
It'll be almost invisible

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:37.899
Unless you hit it with a backlight which brings out the fluorescent dye again that means you can literally paint things to be invisible ones

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:40.090
That glow goes away, but hit it with a black light and it's there

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:46.329
I wonder if that's a new form of invisible ink that we could experiment at the future. I like that different colors of the musical

00:05:46.969 --> 00:05:52.479
Speaking of different colors we have some of those. I think we're going to be trying our magenta and orange mix now

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:56.859
I'm hoping that one's gonna look like fire coming out of the extinguisher. Let's go crack it open and light it up

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:06.699
It's got a little bit of blue residue it's starting to react with that already

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:12.729
That works whoo Wow look at that that is intense

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:21.369
You know if you don't have access to molten metal this might be the next best thing because that looks like glowing red magma

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:26.590
Maybe this instead of looking like fire coming out will look like molten metal. I love it. Yes

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:32.440
glowing molten metal imagine shooting molten metal like glowing molten metal out of a fire extinguisher, that's what this is gonna look like

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:47.589
Guys you really can't have much more fun than this this should look pretty awesome when this shoots out

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:52.869
I'm expecting it's gonna look like flaming. I'm actually thinking it's gonna into turning green as it sprays out

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:57.070
I think it might look more green than orange. We'll see that would be weird let's find out

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:02.440
One oh

00:07:02.479 --> 00:07:06.369
Wow, it comes out orange, and then turns green when it hits the wall it does

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:09.550
That is cool

00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:14.049
That's wild in this light, it's almost got kind of a white tinge to it

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:18.040
It doesn't even look quite that green three two one

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:23.679
Yes, that was amazing

00:07:23.889 --> 00:07:28.299
I love how you put like a big white "s" up on there kind of like a greenish yes a greenish

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:33.550
White "s" whiteish peach somehow. It's green and peach color at the same time this isn't an S

00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:35.550
This is a symbol for hope

00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:47.379
You look like a full-on liquid beam of metal, that's

00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:54.610
Right there's all raining down behind you all this like molten metal. Yes exactly like that

00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:57.550
That's cool.

00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:03.670
I Say we mix it into the fire extinguisher and then shoot it Nate I did come prepared

00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:05.950
I have a full body paint suit with

00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:09.640
Booties and a hood on it and just to make sure it doesn't get in my eyes or mouth

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:15.339
I have some goggles and a snorkel that I'm gonna use hey guys. This is about to happen. It's happening right now

00:08:17.339 --> 00:08:19.339
I'm ready! Lets do this.

00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:31.759
All right, we are charged and ready to go, let's light this boy up

00:08:43.289 --> 00:08:49.338
Ha ha that is epic that is epic oh my goodness you look fantastic that's cool

00:08:53.339 --> 00:08:55.429
That's crazy, I love it. It's fantastic

00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:04.610
Won grand finale we're gonna pour the rest of this juice down Nate's back. Why not oh wow

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:09.589
So Nate you got a little bit of this in your mouth

00:09:09.589 --> 00:09:12.828
Yeah more than I want they tell us about how does that feel it it?

00:09:13.019 --> 00:09:15.739
Tingles like it kind of feels like if you had hot sauce in your mouth

00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:17.449
You don't taste the burning

00:09:17.449 --> 00:09:22.939
But that same tingling feeling but really really strong and it's quite uncomfortable

00:09:23.329 --> 00:09:24.860
It says non-toxic on the package

00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:27.919
But this isn't something that you really want to play with and putting about we're using gloves

00:09:28.019 --> 00:09:33.319
Protective gear we have safety crew medical personnel standing by so this isn't something we recommend trying at home

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:37.039
But it has been a ton of fun. However. It does work great for glowing graffiti

00:09:37.769 --> 00:09:43.129
We nose packing it into something like a fire extinguisher or some kind of squirt gun you can probably use a Super Soaker

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:45.739
Go around and paint your room paint your house

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:49.519
And with the blue glowsticks anyway when it dries it'll pretty invisible

00:09:49.589 --> 00:09:53.059
Yeah, one note if you are trying to put it in a sort of squirt gun this

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:59.750
Fluid does eventually seem to degrade some types of plastics. I'm not sure which ones

00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:01.560
It doesn't do not destroy

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:04.549
Grants gloves look like they're pretty much completely ruined at this point

00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:09.140
So your mileage may vary if you're putting it any sort of squirt gun or Super Soaker. It's true

00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:12.589
If you look closely at my gloves right now, you can see it's it's pretty much eaten right through my thumb

00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:14.719
And the rest of my fingers are really

00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:17.180
They've got kind of like that wrinkly

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:22.759
Pruning effect to them so that is definitely a result of whatever chemicals are in this glow stick fluid

00:10:22.890 --> 00:10:25.640
But it has been a lot of fun playing with you guys today

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:28.999
We don't recommend that you try this at home, but we're so glad that you join us for this experiment

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.160
And we'll be looking for you in the next video talk to you then

00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:40.549
Your microphone your neck ha his neck

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:44.480
That's great, let's get this mannitol
