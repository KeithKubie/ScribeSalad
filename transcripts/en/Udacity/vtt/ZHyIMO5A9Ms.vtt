00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
All right, so we've learned that the electric field exerts a force on particles.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
If I have an E-field that looks like this and I put a positive charge there,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
well, it's going to feel force to the right and a negative charge would feel force to the left.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
All right, but how do I know how to draw these lines?

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Where did they come from? Where did they go? Let's learn about that. The field line himself.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Well, I mentioned before that electric field is not just felt by charges, it's created by charges.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
If I have a positive charge, well the associate electric field will look like this.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
The field lines will be evenly spaced and radiating outwards from the charge.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
This makes sense because I know if I put a positive charge here,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
well it better be repelled from this guy and according to this, it will.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Likewise, a negative charge looks very similar but the field lines point inwards.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Again, this makes sense. I know that a positive charge better be attracted to this negative charge

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.000
and according to this electric field line, it will be and a negative charge, if I put it here, will be repelled

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
since negative charges go opposite the direction of field lines.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Now, knowing what you know about field lines, maybe you can tell me

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
if I have a positive and a negative charge and they're next to each other,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
what would the electric field look like?

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
I'm going to give you a few options and you pick the best one.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Which of these four options do you think best describes the electric field that exists

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
when you have two charges, a positive on the left and a negative on the right.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Do you think it's this one?  Do you think maybe there's no electric field.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Do you think it's this one, where there is no electric field

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
but it bends in this weird way, or maybe this one or that one.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Think about it, think about maybe what would happen if you put a positive

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
test charge somewhere and what direction you'd expect the force to be?

00:01:31.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Good luck. This is a tricky question.
