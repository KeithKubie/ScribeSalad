00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:05.600
Weekends are meant for relaxing and rejuvenating,
but it's easy to forget that when we're swamped

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:11.370
with never-ending homework, college applications
and demanding jobs that have us working overtime.

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.110
Consequently, plans that we originally signed
up for might seem like a hassle now.

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:20.290
It's perfectly okay to stay in, hit the pause
button and catch your breath.

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:26.170
In fact, I’m about to do that myself, so
sit back, relax and come unwind with me, it'll

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:29.080
all be okay, I promise.

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:33.910
Today is my lazy day, with no plans in sight,
I’m starting off with a blank canvas which

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:37.330
means I can paint the day however the way
I want it to be.

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:42.760
Let's check the weather, seems like it's cloudy
and windy, my favorite sweater weather.

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:48.390
I'm going to go downstairs, greet my cat and
brew myself a hot cup of tea.

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.960
Whether you enjoy something calming and herbal
or strongly caffeinated, your boy's got you

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.750
covered, I’m loaded with the good stuff.

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.649
Now on to laundry, sounds like work, right?

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.969
But doing laundry after a long week can actually
be rewarding, I love burying myself with the

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:05.860
scent of fresh clean clothes.

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.799
Now that I have something to wear next week,
there's one less thing I have to worry about.

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:17.930
Here, I’m gonna get the first batch started
and then we'll move on to something else.

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:21.440
I'm really lucky to live in a quiet area surrounded
by woods.

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.830
Today, I think I’ll go for a bike ride.

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:27.420
I've got my favorite cardigan on and a scarf
to keep my neck warm.

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.299
Sometimes nature is the only friend you need.

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.370
As much as I love spending time with my friends
and family, I love going off by myself and

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:37.820
having my own solitary adventures.

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.500
With life these days, it's often quite hard
to get some peace and quiet, so when I have

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.710
the chance, I make the most of it.

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:49.610
I've been thinking lately about how much I’ve
let my own anxiety and depression dictate

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.409
my life, how its taught me cold from taking
certain risks, postpone the time I could have

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:58.930
used to work on personal goals and the way
it would keep me up all night.

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:03.560
It doesn't have to be that way anymore if
I just learn to let go.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.650
If you're going through the same emotions,
I hope you have the guts to do it too.

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:09.049
Ahh, wasn't that fun?

00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:13.230
It felt so good to let the crisp cool air
into my lungs.

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.530
And the way the leaves fell, it looked like
small bits of a kaleidoscope rearranging its

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:18.799
patterns.

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:23.040
That's what I love the most about fall; you
can heal and learn to become what you can

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.569
still be.

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:27.920
Just because everything breaks down in this
time of the year, it doesn't mean good things

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.769
have to come to an end.

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:34.430
Sometimes change happens so better things
can fall into place but we have to be open

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:35.489
to receive it.

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:39.279
I like to think that with every end comes
a new beginning.

00:02:39.279 --> 00:02:42.489
Come inside now, your ears are getting cold,
aren't they?

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:47.109
Let's go back to the kitchen and cook ourselves
a nice dinner, you'll have to excuse me, I

00:02:47.109 --> 00:02:49.279
haven't gone grocery shopping yet.

00:02:49.279 --> 00:02:54.540
Let's see what's available in the pantry.
Hmm, a can of tomato sauce and some angel

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.379
hair, looks like we're having spaghetti.

00:02:57.379 --> 00:02:59.939
Sometimes dinner is the best when it's prepared
simple.

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:03.150
I'm just gonna chop up an onion and throw
in some spinach.

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.889
Fall makes me nostalgic for my mom's cooking.

00:03:05.889 --> 00:03:10.249
In fact, I learned how to make this dish from
her, mmmh, some things never get old.

00:03:10.249 --> 00:03:12.599
Dinner is always better with some company.

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:16.049
Now let's end that night with a hot relaxing
bath.

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:20.040
There's nothing like lighting your favorite
scented candles and sitting with a good book

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.040
and music.

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.299
If you live in the city, it can almost be
impossible to slow down when everyone's always

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:30.529
rushing to get to the next stop, but when
you're in a bathtub, you're safe, warm and

00:03:30.529 --> 00:03:32.219
away from all the noise.

00:03:32.219 --> 00:03:35.909
Whatever scent you picked up from riding the
train or being at school, you can leave all

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:39.199
of that behind you as you soak in these bubbles.

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:45.260
Ahh, looks like it's time for bed now, my
cat knows it too; she's been waiting for me.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.189
I love the way she snuggles up close to me.

00:03:48.189 --> 00:03:51.969
Another day has come to an end but it was
everything I needed.

00:03:51.969 --> 00:03:53.790
Are you feeling better now?

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.680
Keep these tips in mind the next time you're
all wound up.

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.589
What other relaxing techniques do you use?

00:03:59.589 --> 00:04:05.529
Unlike the scriptwriter Catherine, I myself
really like playing video games too online.

00:04:05.529 --> 00:04:07.139
What about you?

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:10.370

Thanks for watching.

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:20.549
Hi everyone, as you may have noticed, we don't
post as often as we'd like anymore.

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:24.610
We are low on funding as our expenses are
exceeding our revenue.

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:28.979
However, we want to keep making more content
that help people learn about psychology and

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:30.139
mental health.

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:33.610
So we want you to be a part of that process.

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:37.060
Starting today, we will have a donate button
underneath our videos.

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:40.990
You've probably seen it in some of your favorite
channels already but if you don't see the

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:44.400
button, we've included a link in the video
description.

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.170
Our vision is to keep making psychology more
accessible to everyone.

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:53.319
We try to keep our videos concise and create
open dialogues among the community.

00:04:53.319 --> 00:04:57.900
As a supporter, you will receive recognition
for your support by having a cool site icon

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:00.229
next to your username when you comment.

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:03.200
This helps us recognize it's you and engage
you more.

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:07.870
On top of this, you will also receive a free
copy of our Psych2Go eBook and occasional

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:09.960
magazines every quarter.

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:15.780
Just email in to myself when you've donated
and I will send you the copies at tia@psych2go.net.

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:22.300
However, even if you cannot support us financially,
we still totally understand, you can help

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:26.789
us out by sharing this video; we still love
you and will give you a free eBook if you

00:05:26.789 --> 00:05:28.199
mail in to let us know.

00:05:28.199 --> 00:05:33.530
There is no fixed term or shady things like
that; you can also cancel your support at

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:36.710
any time too, so there's absolutely no risk.

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:41.699
We promise to use your funding wisely and
for creating new videos that can help others.

00:05:41.699 --> 00:05:44.240
Let's make psychology more accessible for
everyone.
