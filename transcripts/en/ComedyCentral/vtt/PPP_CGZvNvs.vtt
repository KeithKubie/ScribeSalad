Introducing Sever Spine,
the new way to lose weight

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.810 line:0%
by eliminating your
nervous system altogether.

00:00:10.877 --> 00:00:12.311 line:0%
By harnessing
the power of atrophy,

00:00:12.378 --> 00:00:14.914 line:0%
Sever Spine gets rid of all
those unwanted muscles.

00:00:14.981 --> 00:00:17.183
I wanted to lose weight for
my high school reunion,

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:18.784
but I didn't
have a lot of time.

00:00:18.851 --> 00:00:20.487
Thanks, Sever Spine.

00:00:22.588 --> 00:00:24.758
How'd you like to get between
those two chopsticks, huh?

00:00:24.824 --> 00:00:25.892 align:start position:0%
Take a number.

00:00:30.963 --> 00:00:34.767
Are you one of the millions who
tried Slap Chef, Sleep Gym,

00:00:34.834 --> 00:00:38.904
Sever Spine and suffered serious
injury or lost wages?

00:00:38.971 --> 00:00:41.908

Remember that fat ass?

00:00:52.085 --> 00:00:53.018
Yuck.

00:00:53.085 --> 00:00:54.453
Hi, I'm Martin Daniels.

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.956
My eating was out of control,
and exercise?

00:00:57.022 --> 00:00:57.991
Forget it.

00:00:58.057 --> 00:01:00.092
That is,
until I invented these.

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:01.260
Sit ‘Em Ups!

00:01:01.327 --> 00:01:04.029
You can do these things
everywhere.

00:01:04.096 --> 00:01:05.197
On the living room,

00:01:05.264 --> 00:01:06.599 line:92%
in front of a house,

00:01:06.666 --> 00:01:08.635
in the bathroom during
a fancy dinner party.

00:01:10.102 --> 00:01:11.871 align:start position:0%
It just seems like
a regular sit-up.

00:01:11.938 --> 00:01:13.306
Well, it is!

00:01:13.373 --> 00:01:14.974 align:start position:0%
Why do I need you
to tell me to do sit-ups?

00:01:15.041 --> 00:01:18.377 align:start position:0%
Can't I just do sit-ups
and not pay you money?

00:01:18.444 --> 00:01:19.579
Let me ask you something.

00:01:19.646 --> 00:01:21.080
Before I said,
“Do sit-ups,”

00:01:21.147 --> 00:01:22.949
were you thinking
about doing sit-ups?

00:01:23.015 --> 00:01:25.017 align:start size:81% position:19% line:85%
No.

00:01:23.015 --> 00:01:25.017
Then shut your fat mouth!

00:01:25.084 --> 00:01:26.719
Sit ‘Em Ups! Order now!
