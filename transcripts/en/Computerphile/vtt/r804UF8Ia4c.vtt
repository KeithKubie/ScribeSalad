00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.240
Fuzzy logic has been around long time

00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:03.800
it's first described in a paper around 1965

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:06.680
By a man called Lotfi Aliasker Zadeh

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:08.700
And it's been around

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:11.380
It is been in wide spread usage for decades

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.960
But this is still a lot of advancements to be made in it

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:18.220
Fuzzy logic is a way of dealing with uncertainties

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.980
Which is something that computers do not do naturally which human do very well.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.280
So normally, when we think of logic

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:25.520
And when we think about reasoning about things.

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:26.740
The way

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.720
Computers tend to deal with things

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.360
and the way you might instantly think of dealing with things

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.340
Is 'True' or 'False', '1' and '0'.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.080
So for example. You might classify someone.

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:37.620
Who's watching Computerphile as

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:38.960
(def) as someone is watching it 'True'

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.060
Or not watching it 'False'

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:41.020
It's very simple

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.000
There is one option, the other. We have no between.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.060
That's not the way that the real world works

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:47.780
And that's the way that humans work

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.320
So, you can look out of your window now.

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.480
And, you can say: "Today it's nice weather!"

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.280
or if you're in England "It's not nice weather"

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.600
but the definition of "Nice" varies person to person

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.160
With fuzzy logic, instead of just going to 'True' or 'False'.  '1' or '0'

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.180
We have a sliding scale

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:02.600
We have between them

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.060
we have whats called a degree of truth

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:05.880
So I can look out the window

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.880
And say that, today is kind of iffy

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.540
it's a bit sunny with some clouds

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.200
Maybe it's 0.3 "Nice Day" or 0.7 "Nice Day"

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.460
[There is one man asking]

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.960
There is no grey area since it's dark or white

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.220
Exactly, yeah, there are always grey areas.

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:23.700
And the grey areas vary from person-to-person

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:24.960
which come about to later

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.860
So logic is also closely related to 'Sets'.

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:30.880
and "A Set" is a collection of things

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:33.900
when we talk about something being true or false

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.440
we also talk about that be in a set

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:36.580
where something is true

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.400
and if it's not true, then that isn't the set

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:39.940
the set of "Nice Weather"

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:41.380
If I was going to describe

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:42.560
"Nice Weather"

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.260
I will probably decide that

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:45.960
I don't like things too hot

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:46.480
So...

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.940
"Nice" is when it's cold

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.940
but... cold not to wear jacket

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:53.040
but to... not too hot for me to feel uncomfortable

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.720
so that will be the way we called the "Membership Function"

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.580
That gives a value for certain things

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.020
so if I check the temperature

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.900
And I see that it's about 18 degrees, there is no wind

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:05.380
Then that probably fits into a 1

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.580
niceness scale if it's no clouds at all

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.100
theres no shade anywhere

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.300
It's 30 degrees that pretty close to 0 in my scale

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.480
So you get a nice sliding graphs

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.520
That gives us a way from dealing with uncertainty

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.680
So if we look this example on the board

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.380
So this is kinda typical example for fuzzy logic

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:22.760
which you'll see everywhere

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:23.980
This could be a shower controller

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.940
with temperature, things don't just suddenly go from "Hot" to "Cold"

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:29.040
You have different scales

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.320
so, what we have here

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:31.920
Is three of these membership functions

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.760
that are assigning things to different values

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:34.500
So for example

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:36.860
A low temperature, we know that is "Cold"

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.480
And does it get the temperature goes up

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.060
it gets less cold

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.540
And then we start to see "Warm" kicking in

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:44.660
Surround, there we can decide this pretty about 15 degrees

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.040
I'm put natural value on here

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.640
Surround this area. We now know the

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:50.700
We kinda mixing "Warm" and "Cold"

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:53.000
Theres no - It's not strictly "Cold", it's not strictly "Warm"

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:54.880
And we have some story with "Hot"

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:56.680
This gives us a way of dealing with the fact

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.320
that the temperature water isn't strictly

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.280
It's not strictly true or false

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.120
If we look at the shower controller

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.300
We know at the some point.  Someone has decided

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:08.280
This is now no longer cold

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.140
And this is where warm starts kicking in

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.780
So although we're dealing with uncertainties

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:15.300
with call this membership function that allows us to model them

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.860
You still have someone imposing

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:20.220
their definition of that word onto it

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:22.560
someone still needs to assign the values to the membership

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.880
And, that's where things get very complicated.

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:26.600
When you're dealing with fuzzy expert systems

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:29.420
You often to need collect data from many sources

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.100
You have to use various techniques

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:32.440
to consolidate that data

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:34.760
And to train the system to be accurate as possible

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.660
and so when we talk about fuzzy expert systems

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.800
we're basically talking about

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:40.420
A fuzzy system where the

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.260
Membership functions

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:43.140
and the values we're using

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:44.800
have been fed in by experts in

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:45.560
some domain area

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:46.760
So in our example

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.410
it would be experts in knowing what people

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.000
like in their showers they will decide

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.500
at a certain temperature this water is

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:53.800
no longer cold and it starts to get

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.280
towards warmer

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.200
fuzzy logic systems, systems which

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.560
use membership functions like this and have these fuzzy

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:02.190
sets and have these degrees of truth are

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:03.340
a very widely used

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:04.540
in all sorts of things you might not expect

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.380
when you set the set, when your washing machine

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.740
It doesn't just do it exactly the same way every times

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.500
It checks the load of wash

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:11.780
it checks how dirty the water is

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:13.440
after each cycle through it does all

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.330
sorts of things to decide exactly what

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:17.549
temperature and exactly how fast to spin

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:19.350
to make sure that it's as eco efficient

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:20.940
and giving as good a wash as possible

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:23.700
One of the most famous examples of a fuzzy logic system

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.040
use is the

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.000
railway Japan

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:28.500
this is a subway which is one of the

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.500
first uses of fuzzy logic

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.600
Actually, measures

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:35.680
The weight on the train, how far its going

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.100
suspension, all sorts of these things to make sure that it maintains a level, smooth travel

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:43.560
This diagram here use kind of showing the rough outline of fuzzy logic system

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:45.320
We have input shapes crisp values

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:47.040
these are things which aren't yet signed

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.080
a truth value they're not in a fuzzy set

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.290
but then we falsify them so we look at

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:53.670
on membership functions and we apply

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:55.260
some value to them then we have our

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:56.850
fuzzy sets and these go into our

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:58.260
inference system this is where all the

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:59.490
magic happens this is where we then

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:00.930
start from reasons so we have a rule

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.990
base and a rule a quit address on the

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:06.150
board so a rule has the form of an

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:11.360
If water is dirty

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:12.440
Then ...

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:14.380
And then this will also be a fuzzy set

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:16.500
So water is dirty

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:17.960
This is fuzzy set

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.140
we're looking at our water which will

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:21.880
And will check it against

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:23.040
the dirty membership function

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:25.660
So we go back to our shower controller example

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:28.120
Think about that way we might say: "If water is warm"

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:30.100
And we check how much it's warm

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.460
So say dirty we had membership function

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:35.250
some sensor was checking the water to see how

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:37.110
dirty it was and if it was pitch-black

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:39.180
and the sensor detected it was very

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:40.740
dirty we could say that this is 1 and

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:43.860
so then we'd act on it in some way so we

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:45.750
then might say some other fuzzy set it's

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:48.450
a certain value so we would say then

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:51.780
spin very fast or add detergent or do

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:53.940
another rinse cycle. any number of actions

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:57.600
and that gets on to the next point so we

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.340
actually have a rule basis multiple

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:01.680
rules for different membership functions

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:03.090
for different actions and different outputs

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:05.370
and we run all of these rules through

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:06.570
them and then we combine them in this

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:07.470
inference engine that's what the

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:08.790
inference engine does it takes these

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:10.320
rules it applies the fuzzy sets to them

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:11.910
and it combines them to come up with

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:17.220
some output some decided action this

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:18.660
decide action is in the form of fuzzy

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:22.260
sets it then gets de-fuzzified because computers, as I

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:23.520
mentioned earlier, they deal in

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:25.350
certainties they deal in true and falses

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:26.460
that deal in zeroes and ones

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:28.350
we need to de-fuzzify them to

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:31.170
something that the system can use and so

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:33.000
we de-fuzzify and we get critical values

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.430
as output so that's some action so go

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:37.700
back to the washing machine we take in

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:39.830
some measurements of the water

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:41.570
temperature and the water and how dirty

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:44.870
water is we apply those measurements to

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:46.190
our fuzzy sets so we know some

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:48.200
information about so we have some fuzzy

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:50.270
information some true values about how

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:52.850
hot and how dirty the water is we then

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:54.980
check those against overall basis and we

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:57.470
decide on some actions we decide how

00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:01.070
fast it should spin how much water should

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:02.300
be in the next rinse cycle how much

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:04.010
detergent we should mix it we remove the

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:05.570
fuzziness from that and we give a crisp

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:07.280
values output and then that actually is

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:09.200
undertaken by the system ( how does it work

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:11.630
when its not using fuzzy logic )  we'd probably end up

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:15.080
taking our measurements our crisp values

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:18.170
and instead applying an awful lot of if

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:21.140
statements to them so if I rub this out

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:24.980
and there then if temp is less than 30

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:30.080
and dirt is greater than six do rinse

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:32.240
cycle or something like this so you'd

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:34.100
have to do this over and over again once

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:35.360
we have all these rules built up the

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:36.800
build on this it looks very similar to

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:38.360
our rule base but the difference here is

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:42.260
that because we're describing these here

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:43.220
we haven't done anything with this

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:44.540
before we're describing its conditions

00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:45.710
here we haven't done any of these values

00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:47.540
before it's almost as if we're defining

00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:50.120
our membership function in the

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:53.360
conditions and it's a much less concise

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:54.860
way of dealing with things it's not as

00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:56.690
easily maintainable and changeable in

00:07:56.690 --> 00:07:58.690
code it's just a bit messy to be honest

00:07:58.690 --> 00:08:02.090
and if you wanted to if you decide that

00:08:02.090 --> 00:08:03.350
some later date that your washing

00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:05.080
machine would be more efficient if you'd

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:07.820
done a temperature value differently or

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:09.740
a dirt value differently and it'd be

00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:11.060
much more hassle to go back for and

00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:12.230
change or the system much more

00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:13.820
maintainable where as this way we'd have

00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:15.380
to change to rule itself we just change

00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:17.450
our definition of dirty our use of it is

00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:18.800
somewhat hypocritical in that we don't

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:20.030
deal with all uncertainties our

00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:21.470
measurements might be uncertain our

00:08:21.470 --> 00:08:23.930
definitions might be uncertain so

00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:25.370
there's continuing advancements in

00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:26.950
describing these uncertainties better

00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:29.150
but the big problem is once you start

00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:30.350
doing with more uncertainty it's the

00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:32.630
computational demands start to really

00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:34.550
build up and that's the current area

00:08:34.550 --> 00:08:37.040
that is being tackled as well as there's

00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:38.840
in-numerous areas it's ahead very heavily

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:41.170
researched topic and it actually has

00:08:41.170 --> 00:08:43.729
probably one of the largest abundance of

00:08:43.729 --> 00:08:45.500
published papers for any individual

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:47.800
topic

00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:50.970
you're trying to access this bit of

00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:53.220
memory but that's not your memory that

00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:54.720
doesn't belong to you or this program

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:56.160
there's a little programming Java shit

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:59.100
already anyone which is familiar with

00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:02.570
basical understand all of that
