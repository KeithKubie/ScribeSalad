00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:01.500
[music playing]

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:05.270
NARRATOR: In the Yaak
Valley, the stone

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:08.100
bladed lance Tom's crafting
to fulfill a high value

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.600
commission is nearly complete.

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.000
What I'm looking
for in this notch

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.500
is to be able to drop this
point all the way down in there.

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.170
And we're going to have to
make up some pitch glue here.

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:38.030
The pitch glue is an
old, primitive recipe.

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.030
You put it on when it's hot.

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:46.230
And as it dries, it turns to,
what I call, primitive epoxy.

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.800
NARRATOR: Pitch is nature's
original super glue,

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.730
made from a time-tested recipe.

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:54.370
This is lodgepole pine pitch.

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:56.230
That's just a little dried sap.

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:58.630
This is powdered buffalo dung.

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:05.930
Charcoalized,
granulated eggshells.

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.070
And there's just a
little bit of beeswax.

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:11.970
The first thing we need to do is
put the pine pitch on the stove

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.200
and we'll melt it.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.070
NARRATOR: Sinew, or
animal tendon, secures

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:17.970
the blade to the handle.

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:22.770
Hey.

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.530
How's it going?
- Hey, come in.

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:25.630
How are you?

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.470
- Thought I'd come check on you.
- All right.

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.700
Well, you got here just
in the nick of time.

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.830
We got the sinew put on.

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:36.000
Yeah.
Nice.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.630
How would you like
to pitch glue that?

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:39.330
I'd love to.

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.300
You're good at it.

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.730
The object of the pitch
glue is to cover the sinew.

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:49.830
If it ever gets wet, the
sinew will come loose on it.

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:55.400
So the pitch glue will make
the sinew so it's waterproof.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.200
All right.

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.630
Think that'll do it.

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.930
Nice job, young lady.

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.900
What's next for you now?

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.400
I think we'll put a--

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.800
put a buffalo hand grip.

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.030
All right, here we go.

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.030
The Plains Indians used
to put a hand grip on 'em.

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.670
And it was usually fur, and
quite often buffalo hide.

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.430
NARRATOR: A single feather
adorns the lance as a symbol

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.230
of courage and strength.

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.170
It's illegal to
use eagle feathers.

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:36.670
You can't use eagle feathers.

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.130
But you could use wild turkey
feathers, game bird feathers.

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:44.970
This is an awful close match to
what an immature golden eagle

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.730
feather would have looked like.

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.800
We're also going to
add this ermine to it.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.300
Lots of the Native
American stuff

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:56.130
was decorated with
these ermine skins.

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.000
The power of these
little ermines.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.070
I mean, this little sucker here
will kill a four pound rabbit.

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:07.000
And because of that power
that's in these little critters,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.770
the Native Americans
knew that and they

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:12.370
tried to get power
from these animals

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.670
by hanging them on their lances.

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:18.870
Hope this strings.

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.930
Think I'm going to
have to go around it.

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.170
Got one last touch,
and we'll have it done.

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.030
Oh!

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.430
All right.

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.870
I feel real good
about the lance.

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.900
It came out real
good, I thought.

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:51.870
Another project finished
It's neat to have it done.
