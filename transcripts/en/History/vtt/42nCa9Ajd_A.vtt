[Mike whistles]

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.870
JAY: This was found
in Albany, New York.

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.070
And it was found
by Edwin Battison,

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.670
who owned this house
and this property.

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:37.800
MIKE: Okay.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:38.870
JAY: And everything
you're about to see today

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:40.470
is a one-person collection.

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:43.370
JAY: Edwin Battison
was very knowledgeable.

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.270
He was a bit of a curmudgeon,
but he would tell you things

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:48.800
that you had never
heard or realized before.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.570
So I would call him a mentor,
if nothing else.

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.670
JAY: Before he died, we formed
a private museum, non-profit,

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.630
to take the core collection
and somehow preserve it.

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:02.230
JAY: The core collection are
the finest of the objects

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.770
in different fields: clocks,
watches, scientific equipment.

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:08.770
JAY: So we were looking
around for a museum

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.270
that might take it on
as part of their collection.

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.770

some stuff you want to sell.

MIKE: This is exactly
the kind of place

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.730
that I wanted to find
on the East Coast.

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:26.070
You just don't find original
authentic collections this large

no colour on the legs.

been repainted.

here for a long time.

MIKE: Collecting, I mean
obviously, you know,

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:58.600
it comes from the heart

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.700
and it's very personal
and everything.

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:01.900

I mean, I'm not knocking it down

a couple of the knobs.

very ornate too.

I'd rather take 150 for it.

140.

gather themselves.

here is that Jay picked up

where Edwin left off, and he's
still carrying that torch.
