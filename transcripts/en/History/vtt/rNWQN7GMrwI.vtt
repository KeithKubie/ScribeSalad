00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:04.790
NARRATOR: Southeastern Turkey,
buried beneath 20 feet of sand,

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:09.620
archaeologists unearth the
world's oldest temple complex--

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:10.210
Gobekli Tepe.

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:17.170
Radiocarbon dating suggests
that the site dates back

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:21.920
to at least the 10th century
BC, a time before the end

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.750
of the last ice
age and 6,000 years

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.750
before prehistoric man was said
to have developed language.

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:31.420
Gobekli Tepe is really
one of the greatest

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:33.330
archaeological
discoveries of all time.

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:35.250
There are very few
finds in archeology

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.540
that really changed the whole
way we look at the past.

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.080
And that is essentially
what has happened.

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.080
Because our view
of hunter-gatherers

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.000
has changed enormously.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.210
We now know they were
capable of coming together

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.580
in large numbers with
under, presumably,

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.580
some kind of authority to
cooperate on massive projects,

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:55.540
such as Gobekli Tepe,
which involved bringing

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.750
huge pieces of stone from
quite some distance away,

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:01.920
carving it beautifully,
setting these pillars upright,

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.290
and doing this on
a massive scale.

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:09.790
The very first temples in
the world are at Gobekli Tepe.

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:12.790
And this, in many ways,
changes everything.

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:17.880
Because here we have the smoking
gun of a lost civilization.

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.040
It confirms to us
absolutely that at the end

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.750
of the last ice age,
there was high culture

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.540
existing in the world.

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:29.080
There's no doubt in my mind
that there are question marks

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:30.750
all around the ancient world.

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.620
And Gobekli Tepe offers
such a giant question mark

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:38.250
because, according to
mainstream science,

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.250
we were sitting in caves,
munching on bananas.

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.790
And clearly, that
isn't the case.

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.420
NARRATOR: Although to date,
archaeologists have only

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.170
excavated less than one acre
of this 22-acre site, what

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.330
they have found is astounding--

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:01.170
the remains of a complex of
buildings, massive walls,

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.960
and T-shaped stone formations,
some, 9 to 10 feet tall

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.580
and weighing up to 50 tons.

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.670
Many of the stone
pillars are covered

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:18.330
with relief carvings of
animals, reptiles, and insects.

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.000
Archaeologists have
also found figures

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
at the site that appear to
represent humans with strangely

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.830
stylized clothing.

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.330
We have no idea what
these humans represent.

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.710
We suspect that these are
not just simple statues

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:35.170
commemorating people.

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:36.040
They could be gods.

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.540
They could be spirits.

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.540
They could be an ancestors,
something of that kind.

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.540
NARRATOR: But perhaps
most intriguing

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.880
is a life-size statue
found just six miles away

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.540
that has been dated to the
same period, the Urfa Man.

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.710
This looks like a
person who has come

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:56.880
from an advanced civilization,
who's wearing something that

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.380
has much more of
a defined collar,

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:03.210
possibly even some sort
of advanced space suit.

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:05.210
What the heck is he doing there?

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:06.710
His face looks strange.

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:08.000
He's bald.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.750
His head, his eyes look weird.

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.750
There's something
unusual about this guy.

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.170
And that could be
a clue that leads

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.330
us into the mystery
of an antediluvian

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.210
or pre-flood civilization.

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:24.250
NARRATOR: Is it possible that
the strange humanoid figure

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:29.500
found near Gobekli Tepe actually
represents an extraterrestrial,

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:34.330
a being from a lost civilization
that existed on Earth sometime

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.710
before the last ice age?

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:40.750
If so, does it give credence
to other ancient stories

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.580
describing other worldly
civilizations that

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:46.000
once existed here on Earth?

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.290
All over the world, we have
giant statues and carvings

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:54.250
of people's faces and heads.

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:56.460
Some of them are
giant colossal heads,

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:58.960
like the Olmec colossal heads.

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:01.460
Others are the
Easter-Island-type statues,

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:05.790
which are huge and depict
people who have elongated heads.

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:08.210
They're cone heads, essentially.

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:11.920
They were giants of yore,
with godlike powers.

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.460
In my mind, we would call
them extraterrestrials.

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:19.580
There is this recessed
courtyard in Tiwanaku that

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:21.380
has all these different faces.

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:25.290
These stones were found
underneath the soil,

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:27.960
meaning that at some
point, some type of event

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:31.170
happened that buried
these particular stones.

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:40.120
Some have actually surmised
that they represent some type

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:44.330
of a pre-flood civilization,
that what we have here is,

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:47.960
in fact, a remnant that
depicts that society.
