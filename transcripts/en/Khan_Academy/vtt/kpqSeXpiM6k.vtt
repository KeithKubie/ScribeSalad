00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:03.020
In the last couple of videos,
I've been dumping on the

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:04.700
Geithner Plan.

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:07.710
Arguably showing that if right
now the market is willing to

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.080
rationally pay $30 for a
security, even with the free

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.670
put option that the government's
willing to give,

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.900
at most a rational investor who
was willing to pay $30 is

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.400
now maybe willing to
pay $40 to $50.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.960
And that still won't meet the
hurdle that the banks need in

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.650
order to clear these assets
off their books.

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:28.820
Because, we've done it in a
bunch of videos even when I

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.555
did the videos on the first
bailout, the TARP plan, that

00:00:31.555 --> 00:00:35.100
if they sell them for less than
$60, that's the number

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.020
you hear in a lot of the popular
press, that the banks

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:40.100
will essentially be insolvent.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.470
So they're not even willing
to sell for less than $60.

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:45.770
So if this is the case then
the plan won't work.

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:46.270
Right.

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:48.116
It just won't work.

00:00:48.116 --> 00:00:50.260
It won't work.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.280
Now, there's the other scenario
where, let's say we

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.470
do see a bunch of trades
where they are going

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:56.300
for $60, $70, $80.

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.730
And based on some of the
arguments I've given in the

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.590
previous video, I'd say well,
the only rational person

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.780
willing to pay $60-plus would
be the banks themselves by

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.320
creating some type of off
balance sheet investor.

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:10.730
There's tons of ways
they've done this.

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:12.960
I've gotten some letters where
people said how can a bank

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:13.930
sell to themselves?

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.190
Well, you can give a
non-recourse loan to a hedge

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:19.280
fund that you just created
and that hedge fund

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.450
then invests in them.

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.200
And to somehow have an audit
trail, almost every hedge fund

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.840
in the world has some
relationship with one of these

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:28.470
major banks.

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.920
So it would be almost impossible
to disassociate the

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.730
private investors from the major
banks that are trying to

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:36.890
offload these assets.

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.840
So I would argue that this
probably is the case.

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.300
But in this video I like to give
Geithner and maybe even

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.850
the plan a bit of a break, and
give some credence to one of

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.140
the arguments that they make.

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.800
Right now, because of all of
these assets going sour all at

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.150
once, you have all of these
forced sellers, right?

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.350
You have all of these banks and
they're all facing these

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:00.000
liquidity issues.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:07.290
So you have this huge amount of
supply of these securities.

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.110
And right now since all of the
natural buyers are distressed,

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.590
all of these banks are forcing
to sell, all the hedge funds

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.480
who used to own these things,
they're all going bust. And

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:17.640
they're facing redemptions.

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.260
And their investors want
their money back.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.090
So the actual demand for these
securities, the actual pool of

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:23.890
money going after
is very small.

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.240
So the demand is very small.

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.820
And they're saying this is the
reason why you have this

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:30.780
market disconnect.

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.970
This is the reason why people
are only willing to pay $30,

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.990
because you have this
illiquidity.

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:39.850
You have all of these forced
sellers and you have very few

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:41.660
buyers left in the market.

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.850
And the few buyers that are left
in the market are able to

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:45.290
get things at fire
sale prices.

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.480
That's the argument that we've
heard time and time again

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.530
about how $30 isn't
the real price.

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.780
That anyone who actually looked
at what's in these,

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.820
what have unfortunately been
called toxic securities,

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:57.870
probably because that's
what they are.

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.450
But anyone who looks at one of
these securities and really

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.370
looks inside of them will
realize that these are worth

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:03.630
way more than $30.

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.250
That they're yielding a lot.

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.080
That there will be some defaults
but maybe they're

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.120
really only worth $80 or $70
or $0.70 on the dollar.

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.140
My argument, if is really the
case, what the government

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:17.350
should do instead of giving
free put options to hedge

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:20.220
funds to essentially subsidize
the assets from banks.

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.590
Or, even worse, allowing the
banks to do kind of that

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.550
scheme that I talk about in the
second video where they

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:26.470
can buy things from themselves
and offload

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:27.670
things on the taxpayer.

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.350
What the government should
do is really increase the

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:33.290
transparency on these securities
so that this pool

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:34.710
of buyers becomes larger.

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:36.610
Right now these securities,
these are either

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:39.190
collateralized debt obligations
or mortgage backed

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.860
securities.

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:41.830
They're bonds of some kind.

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:44.820
And the pool of people who can
buy bonds is not a large one.

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:47.100
It's essentially a bunch of
professional investors, most

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.510
of whom have blown up in
this credit debacle.

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:54.780
Let me draw a little
balance sheet.

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.430
You take those toxic assets,
let's say this is a random

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.920
bank's balance sheet.

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:03.090
That's its assets, liabilities,
equity.

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:07.080
And it has one of these toxic
assets sitting on it.

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.320
Right.

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:08.910
This is a toxic asset.

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:12.570
What you do is you take the
toxic assets, stick them in a

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:18.180
company-- this is some
corporation-- so then the

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.440
toxic assets go there.

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.280
That's the assets.

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.670
And the corporation will just
have a bunch of shares.

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:27.370
If all the toxic assets came
from this bank, give these

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:29.300
shares back to the bank.

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.610
And notice this isn't any
sketchy accounting.

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:34.370
The banks still have the assets
on their balance sheet,

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.300
but instead of having the assets
directly they have the

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.030
shares in this company.

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:40.510
And the whole reason I'm doing
this is and you can then take

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:43.660
this company and float it on
a traditional exchange.

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:45.790
I mean we're talking about the
government, The U.S. Treasury.

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:49.680
They could force this thing to
be listed on the New York

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:50.790
Stock Exchange.

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:55.400
So just by doing that, that
significantly increases the

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:58.610
pool of investors who could
invest in it, right?

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:00.510
Right now the only people who
could invest in it are people

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:02.350
who are essentially
bond investors.

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:04.980
And it's not a trivial matter
to start investing in bonds.

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:07.610
You have to invest in $1,000
increments at minimum.

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:09.790
Usually it's much larger
block sizes.

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:11.520
And some of these are
collateralized debt

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:12.230
obligations.

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:16.660
They're just hard to invest
in even if you wanted to.

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:17.860
Now, the second problem.

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:21.450
That would solve just the pool
of people who could invest. So

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:23.190
that'll make it a
little larger.

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:26.600
But the second problem, this is
frankly the bigger problem

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:29.490
with these assets, is that
there's no transparency.

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:32.630
No-one knows what's in
these toxic assets.

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:33.350
Right?

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:36.710
The problem that happened over
this last real estate boom is,

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:39.430
not only did they give loans to
people that they shouldn't

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:41.960
have given loans to, but they
sliced and diced them.

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:44.540
And I've done this in a bunch
of the videos in the past.

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:48.090
They'll take a bunch of
mortgages, they'll take

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:52.170
millions of mortgages, put them
in a corporate structure.

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:55.680
And then they slice and dice
them into different tranches.

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:57.220
And I explained this in the
collateralized debt

00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:57.700
obligations.

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:00.520
Where this tranche gets paid off
first, this tranche gets

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:03.580
paid off second, and this
tranche gets paid off last. So

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:06.830
any losses on this, this group
takes it first. And for the

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:10.200
most part these are the
toxic securities.

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:13.570
But some of these have
also gone toxic.

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:16.570
The problem with these things is
that the way that they sold

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:20.110
them is that they went to
Moody's or S&amp;P and they said,

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:21.920
hey, Moody's, give us
a rating on these

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:22.910
securities right here.

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:25.080
And Moody's would say oh that's
a AAA-- and, well they

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:26.250
wouldn't call that AAA,
but they would

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:27.900
say that's a B security.

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:29.750
And we just took Moody's
word for it

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:30.800
that that's a B security.

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:33.550
Or that this right here
is a AAA security.

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:36.280
And everyone now knows that the
only reason why Moody's

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:38.660
gave the rubber stamp on it is
because the same people who

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:41.400
were structuring these things
and making all the money off

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:42.500
of these things were
the same people

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:44.860
who were paying Moody's.

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:45.970
So what we need to do is

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:48.480
disintermediate the rating agencies.

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:50.130
So the government, not only
should it create these

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:53.210
corporations so that you could
essentially buy these assets

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:55.570
without being a bond trader, you
can just buy them on any

00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:59.260
exchange, what the government
should do is hire a big team.

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.980
And we're talking about billions
or trillions of

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:05.300
dollars here, so to hire a team
that essentially puts up

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:07.900
a website and lets us know
what's in each of these

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:08.390
securities.

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:10.760
So let's say that this company
that I just created, its

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:14.590
sticker symbol is ABCD.

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:19.880
So what we can do is we can go
to a website, type in ABCD,

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:23.470
and it'll tell me exactly what
is in that toxic security.

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:26.450
I know a lot of people who are
professional investors who are

00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:29.320
in a position, if they wanted
to, to pull the trigger and

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:30.980
even buy them in their
current form.

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:32.930
And they're afraid to because
they don't know what's in

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:33.850
these toxic securities.

00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:37.700
They don't know whether they're
completely fraudulent,

00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:39.180
only somewhat fraudulent.

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:41.180
To some degree it's even hard
to tell where a lot of the

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:42.980
assets are sitting, in which
of the tranches.

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:45.270
So what the government should
do is just make these as

00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:46.730
transparent as possible.

00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:50.510
They should have a map of the
United States and they should

00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:54.280
say this security is for houses
that are in upstate New

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:57.190
York and in Florida,
and its 30% upstate

00:07:57.190 --> 00:07:59.790
New York and X% Florida.

00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:03.510
It should have charts that tell
me what percentage is

00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:04.340
defaulting.

00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:07.020
So I as an investor maybe
I can extrapolate

00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:08.440
things, I can do models.

00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:12.530
But the crux of the issue here
is that instead of having some

00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:16.030
opaque 800-page document that
only a few people have access

00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:19.300
to and once they decide to parse
through that thing they

00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:22.790
have to go to their local bond
trader and invest in it that

00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:26.610
way, what you do is you put it
into a company, list that

00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:30.740
company on the NYSE, and then
make it completely transparent

00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:33.890
what's in that toxic security so
that anybody watching this

00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:38.200
video can say, you know what, I
think this thing is actually

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:40.880
worth $0.40 on the dollar,
not $0.30 on the dollar.

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:42.610
And you won't have to commit
millions of dollars.

00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:46.570
You could just go buy 1,000
shares for $400.

00:08:46.570 --> 00:08:49.000
It wouldn't be a major
up-front investment.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.960
And if they did this,
this would solve

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:52.670
the liquidity problem.

00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:54.210
This would solve the
liquidity problem.

00:08:54.210 --> 00:08:57.310
This pool of buyers would then
become much, much larger.

00:08:57.310 --> 00:08:59.130
And then the government wouldn't
be able to make this

00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:00.690
argument, and the banks wouldn't
be able to make this

00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:04.220
argument that somehow that these
are distressed sales.

00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:07.240
That these $30 sales are way
below the actual value.

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:09.630
Because you would have a
lot of people with real

00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:13.670
information, with real access
to actually trading them,

00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:15.500
being able to price
these securities.

00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:19.220
And then when you're forced to
do a mark to market -- First

00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:23.060
of all since each of these
shares in this security will

00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:24.760
be trading on the New York Stock
Exchange, you'll much

00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:25.990
more volume of the
transactions.

00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:27.750
You'll have continuous
trading.

00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:30.200
And then the mark to market that
you'll be forced to do on

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:34.110
these, essentially shares now,
but it's the same thing right?

00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:36.180
It's shares in your
toxic asset.

00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:38.100
But the mark to market on
those will be much more

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:40.250
accurate because you'll have
much more volumne.

00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:43.630
You'll have much better market
information as far as what

00:09:43.630 --> 00:09:45.180
they're worth.

00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:47.670
And then frankly if it turns out
that these things really

00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:51.230
are worth $30, then we can let
the banks fail and move on

00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:52.750
with our lives.

00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:55.360
And I've argued you could
arguably start new banks or do

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:56.270
something else.

00:09:56.270 --> 00:09:59.450
But we won't be kind of playing
this charade of what

00:09:59.450 --> 00:10:00.490
are these assets worth?

00:10:00.490 --> 00:10:02.550
Wait, maybe we should
subsidize the banks.

00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:05.450
Maybe we should be writing
free put options to hedge

00:10:05.450 --> 00:10:07.320
funds and making
it all opaque.

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:09.790
The solution is just expose
everything to sunshine.

00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:12.730
And then let the market price
really reflect a true reality.

00:10:12.730 --> 00:10:15.500
And if that reality is that
these banks are bankrupt, well

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:17.410
then, you let them
go bankrupt.
