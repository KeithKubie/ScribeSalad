The bigger a movie, the more stories and unbelievable
details surface from its production. And with

00:00:11.311 --> 00:00:15.820
Batman battling Superman with Wonder Woman
not far behind, a movie can't get much bigger.

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:19.650
With that in mind, we're here without latest
case of rapid fire trivia, making sure that

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.830
comic book fans know all the best stories
about DC's universe launching blockbuster

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:28.580
in our new dose of Know Your Movies: 20 Amazing
Batman V Superman Facts.

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.430
Good Advice
When Ben Affleck ran into Christian Bale not

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:35.210
long after he'd been announced as the next
Batman, he asked the retiring Dark Knight

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.331
if he had any advice for capturing a character
like Bruce Wayne. Bale's only response? To

00:00:39.331 --> 00:00:42.840
make sure that this time around, the costume
department put a zipper in the suit so he

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.719
wouldn't need a team to answer nature's call.
They did.

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.730
New Blood
When Zack Snyder went from Superman to Batman,

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:52.250
he begged composer Hans Zimmer to come with
him. Having done impressive work with Man

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.110
of Steel, he agreed. But since he was also
the mind behind Christopher Nolan's Batman

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:00.020
music, felt it would be impossible for him
to start from scratch. As a compromise, he

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.929
brought in friend and collaborator Junkie
XL to handle the Dark Knight, while he stuck

00:01:03.929 --> 00:01:06.490
to the other characters.
Size Matters

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.780
It's impossible to think of an actor who can
truly embody all aspects of an anti-hero like

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.610
Batman, but the producers of the movie revealed
that it wasn't just talent, but height they

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.620
were looking for. To get the right dynamic
between the green Superman and veteran Batman,

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:23.290
they wanted an actor whom Henry Cavill would
have to literally&nbsp;look up to. At around 6'3",

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.860
Ben Affleck stands more than a little taller
than the Man of Steel.

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.200
Second Time's The Charm
His movie roles may have divided audiences,

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.060
but over the past decade, Ben Affleck has
shown himself to be a talented director - and

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.690
a gifted dramatic lead. That's the reason
Warner Bros. first approached him to direct

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:41.550
the Superman reboot that became Man of Steel.
Since he was inexperienced with CG blockbusters,

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:45.951
he turned down the job. When he was approached
to STAR in a DC movie, it took Zack Snyder

00:01:45.951 --> 00:01:50.190
to convince him to not just take the part,
but learn some tricks of the trade firsthand.

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:52.980
Written in Rubber
In Man of Steel, Superman's famous 'S' was

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:57.410
revealed to be a message in Krpytonian. For
the follow-up, the team went even farther.

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:01.220
Lines were written, then translated in to
Kryptonian writing, and embedded into Superman's

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:06.180
costume itself, from the arms to the chest,
and who knows where else on the finished suit.

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.160
A Strange Reveal
It was obvious from the casting that nobody

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.200
was looking to tell a Batman origin story,
but a flashback to the iconic death of Thomas

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.921
and Martha Wayne was inevitable, with Snyder's&nbsp;Watchmen&nbsp;star
Jeffrey Dean Morgan playing the part. But

00:02:17.921 --> 00:02:22.180
how Morgan was actually revealed was more
than a little strange. Not a leak, or hint,

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.120
but a painting. That's right, a prop painting
of Thomas Wayne that was unmistakable as the

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.849
actor let the world in on the secret earlier
than expected.

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:32.769
Making Good on Man of Steel
The movie offers more than one reason why

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:37.580
Superman killing General Zod was a mistake,
but the ending to Man of Steel was no accident.

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.719
When even Christopher Nolan thought Super
should only defeat Zod, Snyder convinced him

00:02:41.719 --> 00:02:46.040
that the hero's commitment to never kill had
to be a lesson he learned. Nolan agreed, letting

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.769
the superhero he reimagined arrive to hold
Superman accountable in his sequel.

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:54.069
Middle-earth Hopefuls
Before Ben Affleck was cast, everyone had

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:57.999
their own Batman actor in mind. For fans who
want to see three potential Batmen in one

00:02:57.999 --> 00:03:03.060
film, just load up The Hobbit Trilogy, since
Richard Armitage, Luke Evans and Orlando Bloom

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.600
have all been considered to play The Dark
Knight.

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.099
Small Town Heroes
By landing the role of the King of Atlantis,

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:12.829
actor Jason Momoa becomes one of the most
famous people to ever hail from the small

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:17.969
town of Norwalk, Iowa, population of under
10,000. In a true case of freakish coincidence,

00:03:17.969 --> 00:03:22.400
his only competition might be from the small
town's OTHER famous son, Brandon Routh, the

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.489
former Superman himself.
The Last Laugh

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:29.580
When fans first saw the defaced Robin costume
in Batman's batcave, they didn't ask who was

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.420
behind the writing and laughter spray painted
onto it. But just to confirm it was the Joker's

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.790
handiwork, the second trailer for Suicide
Squad shows the exact same handwriting over

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:39.719
top of the company cards (shown at the very
beginning of the trailer).

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:42.150
Keepsake Coins
When production on the movie was close to

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.549
wrapping, Henry Cavill decided to give the
crew members a gift to remember the experience.

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:50.849
In true Superman fashion, Cavill distributed
coins bearing the title, shoot dates, and

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:52.590
logos of each of the films title heroes.&nbsp;

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.829
Pennyworth, Alfred Pennyworth
The movie keeps up the new tradition of casting

00:03:56.829 --> 00:04:00.510
a well known British film star as Batman's
butler, with Jeremy Irons playing the role

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:04.299
after Michael Caine. But it was another actor
with a very different experience using clever

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:08.849
gadgets and engaging in stealth action - Timothy
Dalton, the former James Bond.

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:12.180
Holly HunteD
Fans won't find a DC Comics inspiration behind

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:17.510
the character of Senator Finch, even if anti-Superman
lawmakers are nothing new. But director Zack

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:20.970
Snyder admitted at Comic-Con that he created
the character specifically for actress Holly

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:25.690
Hunter, for no other reason than wanting to
work with the veteran talent, and seeing his

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:27.600
chance.
Passing on The Title

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.240
When Zack Snyder decided that a new Batman
was needed to face off against Superman in

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:35.550
Man of Steel's universe, apparently even the
studio had trouble understanding. Snyder even

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:39.480
considered casting actor Christian Bale in
a different role in his Justice League universe

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:43.780
just to demonstrate that Bale's Batman would
be completely replaced. In the end, everyone

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:46.530
got the idea.
Cloth, not Combat Armor

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:50.280
Ben Affleck's Batsuit couldn't be more different
from the versions before, but it's not just

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:54.190
a case of changing looks. The costume designer
claims that the decision to build the suit

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:58.890
out of cloth and fabrics, as opposed to body
armor, was an intentional choice, sending

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:04.100
the message that it was muscle that made this
Batman dangerous, not cutting edge technology.

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:07.130
Filling Out
To make sure that he would be up to that challenge,

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:11.030
Ben Affleck apparently began intense training
the day after he was cast, eventually adding

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:15.330
more than 20 pounds of muscle to his frame,
and dropping to just 8% body fat.

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:18.950
Second Time's The Charm
Henry Cavill learned his lesson when he decided

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:22.530
to gain weight for a role between filming
The Immortals and Man of Steel. By staying

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:27.340
at his Superman size, he had a serious headstart,
adding twice the bulk that had stunned audiences

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:31.320
in Man of Steel. When the first official photo
showed Superman even more broadchested than

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:34.210
before, it was worth the work.
Written Warnings

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:38.530
Getting cast as a famous superhero is guaranteed
to bring out the critics. Warner Bros. was

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:42.960
well aware of that fact, so to calm Ben Affleck's
fears, they found some of the worst reactions

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:47.750
fans had to now famous and beloved actors
in superheroes roles. The message was sent,

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:51.410
but Affleck couldn't help himself, reading
the first negative comment, and swearing off

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:54.790
the Internet conversation completely.
A Dark Knight Director

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:58.620
Having won an Oscar from behind the camera,
Ben Affleck admitted that shooting the film

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:02.770
was a crash course in blockbuster directing.
When reading the script, Affleck admitted

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:06.280
he couldn't help blocking out the scene and
picturing the camera angles he would use.

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:09.950
But when he arrived on set, Zack Snyder's
solutions and use of cutting edge filming

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:13.930
techniques showed Affleck that he still had
a lot to learn if he hoped to tackle a comic

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:16.570
book movie himself.
Crimefighting Isn't Cheap

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:20.820
Like any Batman fan, Ben Affleck made sure
to lay claim to the Batsuit when production

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:24.750
wrapped. Apparently, even a millionaire movie
star isn't as rich as Bruce Wayne, since the

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:29.000
costume department told him he could absolutely
take home the souvenir - if he covered the

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.290
$100,000 price tag. Affleck decided on taking
plenty of photos instead.

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:37.130
Those are just some of the incredible details,
bits of trivia and stories from the set of

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:41.251
DC's superhero showdown, but which ones have
we missed? Let us know in the comments, and
