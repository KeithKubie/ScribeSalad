This episode was proudly made possible by
the all-new 2015 Subaru Legacy.

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:08.809
It's not just a sedan, it's a Subaru.

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:13.290
The appendix is one of the human body’s
greatest mysteries, but did you know it actually

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.340
does serve a purpose?

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:24.929
Hey guys, Tara here for Dnews - and as usual,
everything we know about the human body is

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:25.929
wrong.

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:30.240
We’ve been taught for generations now that
the appendix is completely useless, with many

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.680
textbooks suggesting that it’s nothing more
than a vestigial organ - something that used

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.430
to serve a purpose, but is now redundant.

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:38.870
But it turns out that’s only partially true.

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.640
And a study out of Duke University, found
that while it’s not necessary for survival,

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.060
the appendix actually does serve a function
- essentially, it’s a safehouse for good

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:49.060
bacteria.

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:53.440
The idea here is that certain diseases, like
cholera - an infection of the small intestine

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.100
caused by contaminated water - and dysentery,
an infection that causes bloody diarrhea - can

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.980
wipe out all of the bacteria that our guts
need for digestion.

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:05.510
And when that happens, the appendix steps
in and basically “reboots” the digestive

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:07.770
system, by replenishing all the good bacteria.

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.250
Now obviously, people living in developed
countries don’t have to worry much about

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.500
those kinds of infections - which is why we’re
perfectly capable of living without an appendix.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.880
But it does make you wonder - why humans still
get appendicitis, if that organ never really

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:21.880
gets used?

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.579
And it turns out, it’s similar to the reason
we get allergies.

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:28.890
By living in a modern hygienic society, we’re
rarely ever exposed to dangerous pathogens

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.109
or parasites - so when our immune system finally
DOES get challenged, it overreacts.

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:37.820
It’s called the “hygiene hypothesis”
- and in the case of your appendix, an overreactive

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.509
immune system can lead to obstruction of the
intestines, that in turn, leads to appendicitis.

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.030
So when you think about it, the reason your
appendix never gets used - modern hygiene

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:48.950
- is also the reason it gets inflamed.

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.649
And as someone who’s had their appendix
removed, I can say that the pain of living

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.729
with an inflamed one, is a lot of more severe
than the consequences of living without it.

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.710
So don’t feel bad at all about having it
removed.

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.319
As far as I’m concerned, good riddance!

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:01.569
What about you guys though?

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:03.139
Have you had your appendix taken out?

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:04.780
And how awesome were those scars?

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.920
