00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:04.790
MALE SPEAKER: Today we are
joined by two inspirational

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:07.100
storytellers from Oracle
Team USA--

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:08.090
Julian Guthrie.

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:10.560
She's the author of "The
Billionaire and the Mechanic."

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:14.140
And we're also joined by
Joseph Ozanne who is an

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:15.840
engineer with Oracle Team USA.

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:17.370
Please join me in welcoming
them to Google.

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:18.410
Thank you very much.

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:20.440
JULIAN GUTHRIE: So my book,
"The Billionaire and the

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:23.400
Mechanic: How Larry Ellison and
a Car Mechanic Teamed Up

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.610
to Win Sailing's Greatest Race,
The America's Cup," it's

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:29.550
been out for about a month.

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.210
It's official pub
date was June 4.

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:35.430
And we've had a great
reception.

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:36.290
Happily it landed.

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:38.050
It's a national best-seller.

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.560
And this last weekend I noticed
it was number nine on

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.020
the northern California
best seller list.

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.920
And we also have an option
on it for a film.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.230
So I hope you like the book
because at some point you may

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:52.060
see it as a feature film.

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:54.540
And I'll be taking suggestions
later for

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:56.600
who should play Larry.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.610
And that will be interesting
coming from here.

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:04.640
And who will play the mechanic,
whose name is

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:05.990
Norbert Bajurin.

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.320
And he's a great part
of this story.

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.830
He is the commodore of the
Golden Gate Yacht Club today.

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.420
And he was in 2001 when
this all was launched.

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:19.220
So this is a story really about
these two men who seem

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.750
so different, the billionaire
and the mechanic.

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.810
And their singular quest for
the America's Cup, which is

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.050
the oldest trophy in
international sports.

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:31.730
And I started this story
because I was really

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:36.020
interested in the drama of
going after the Cup.

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.650
But again, this unusual
partnership

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:40.610
between Larry and Norbert.

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.560
And Norbert, as I said, was the
commodore of the Golden

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.750
Gate Yacht Club-- which
this was in 2001.

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:51.620
The yacht club, for those of you
who may know it, it's down

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:55.520
beyond past the better
known, more elite St.

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:56.850
Francis Yacht Club.

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.870
When I went there when Norbert
became commodore, it was

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:01.300
basically a sinking ship.

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.250
It was $450,000 in debt.

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.690
And he feared he had been named
the commodore who would

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:11.180
close the doors and
lower the burgee.

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.640
So he was reaching out, grasping
at straws, trying to

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.710
find a way to save this old
blue-collar boating

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:21.470
institution on the San Francisco
waterfront when he

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.340
read, lo and behold, that
Larry Ellison and Oracle

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.240
Racing had had a falling out
with the St. Francis.

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.210
And he thought, well, why can't
our little club be the

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.940
sponsoring club of
Oracle Racing?

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.090
And everybody around him
said, you're nuts.

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.380
This is never going to happen.

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.050
Why would Oracle Racing and
Larry Ellison partner with

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:44.140
this kind of unknown club
sinking in debt.

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.940
Well, he didn't listen
to the naysayers.

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.880
And he made the deal happen.

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.670
Along the way in about three
months, I think he

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.000
lost about 30 pounds.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.850
And he was working at the
radiator shop by day, and he

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:57.460
was negotiating this
deal at night.

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:00.320
And he was trying to save the
Golden Gate Yacht Club and

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.490
make it into the little
engine that could.

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:06.760
So they formed this unlikely
friendship and partnership

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.970
that exists today.

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.840
And so this story is about
the two of them.

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:17.660
But it's also about many of the
builders, and the sailors,

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:23.410
and the engineers who dreamed
for much of their lives of

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:26.470
being a part of a winning
America's Cup team.

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:29.680
Whether it's a Jimmy Spithill,
the sailor of Oracle Racing,

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.440
who dreamed from when he was
a child of being a part of

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.800
winning the America's
Cup on the sailboat.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.110
He's an Australian.

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:42.980
And he was four years old, I
believe, when Australia rested

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:47.280
the Cup away from America in
1983 after the longest winning

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.370
streak in sports.

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:54.120
And parties rang out on
his beach for weeks.

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.850
And he thought, I'm going
to be a part of this

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:57.020
someday, and he was.

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:01.090
Or whether it's Joseph
Ozanne who wanted--

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:05.690
from the time he was a child--
to be a part of this thing

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:09.920
called the America's Cup, but
not to be on the boat, but to

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:13.370
be someone who designed,
who engineer the boats.

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:19.140
And so my book tells the story
of the dreams, the human

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:23.960
drama, the unlikely
partnerships, the losses that

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.960
led to the ultimate
victory in 2010.

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.370
So I'm going to read just a
couple of very quick vignettes

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:31.940
from the book.

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:37.250
And this book starts in the
Sydney to Hobart Race of 1998,

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:39.860
which I'm sure most of
you have heard about.

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:42.840
It was, at the time, the worst
maritime disaster in

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.000
Australian history.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.980
Larry Ellison, who is an
accomplished sailor, he was

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:52.100
racing on his boat, "Sayonara."
And they had just

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:54.840
come through the eye
of the hurricane,

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.940
which was not predicted.

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:02.170
So they were all taken by
surprise and felt that their

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:04.420
lives were definitely
in danger.

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:06.310
So this is when they've
come out of

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:08.230
the eye of the hurricane.

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:13.910
And this is an important place
to start the book and just

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:19.720
start this story because, for
one thing, after Larry Ellison

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:23.410
completed this race, he said
no more open ocean racing.

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:24.340
I'm done with this.

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:26.800
I'm going for around
the buoys regattas.

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:31.940
But it also, for him, reminded
him of the impermanence of all

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:36.450
things, of the fragile state
of life as we know it.

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:39.420
And that is something that has
stayed with him today.

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:44.180
And this race remains very
significant in his life.

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:47.200
And I'm reading this part that
as a writer I'm very proud of

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:52.690
because I think that it's
very evocative.

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:54.010
And I love the language of it.

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:56.960
So thanks for humoring
me a little bit.

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:00.060
"On the morning of the third
day, the sun was just coming

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:03.910
up as 'Sayonara' entered the
Derwent River, an estuary

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:06.355
leading to the capital
of Tasmania.

00:06:06.355 --> 00:06:10.980
A salmon pink light cut through
the mauve morning sky.

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:14.390
The crew of 'Sayonara,' the
first to reach the Derwent,

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:17.740
was welcomed by a small
powerboat with a man on board

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:21.030
playing Scottish highland
bagpipes, the traditional

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:23.580
welcome for a winning boat.

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:26.110
On this day, the songs
were somber.

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:28.270
The wind was a whisper,
blowing at

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:30.330
less than eight knots.

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:33.510
Larry and his crew were in the
river valley, and the wild

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:37.670
flowers, fern, and towering
trees carpeted deep-cut

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:40.240
canyons with red dirt ridges.

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:44.290
The wild flowers in shades of
blue, white, crimson, purple,

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:47.900
and heather were bathed
in soft pink light.

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:51.170
Larry closed his eyes for a
moment listening to the sounds

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:54.810
of the bagpipe and to the waves
gently lapping at the

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:56.810
side of the boat.

00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:58.630
The air was perfectly calm.

00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:01.300
The waves like a reassuring
heartbeat.

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:05.850
The glory of life was theirs."

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:08.430
So that was, as I said,
that was a very

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:10.290
significant turning point--

00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:15.300
surviving the Sydney to Hobart
and coming out of that.

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:17.030
So I'm going to jump around
a little bit.

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:18.620
And the next scene I'm
going to read just

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:20.430
a little bit from.

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:22.530
I'm going to cut my talk a
little bit short because I

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:23.500
want to get to Joseph.

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:26.020
Because his story is
really fantastic.

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:28.090
And you're going to see
some great video--

00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:29.390
it's going to astound you--

00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:32.535
of the new boats and of the boat
that won the America's

00:07:32.535 --> 00:07:35.310
Cup for Oracle Racing in 2010.

00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:38.090
So I'm going to read
something.

00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:41.220
When I was interviewing Larry
Ellison, we got to talking

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:44.650
about his friendship with Steve
Jobs and about the time

00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:46.500
that the two of them
spent together.

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:51.160
And he gave me a lot of great
detail on their friendship and

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:52.300
their talks.

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:56.470
And here is one where
they are walking

00:07:56.470 --> 00:07:58.960
the grounds of Larry's--

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:00.190
then under construction--

00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:04.810
Woodside estate and talking
about who was the greatest

00:08:04.810 --> 00:08:07.460
person ever.

00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:08.330
Yeah.

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:10.740
So you can make your own guesses
as to who you think

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:11.820
they will each choose.

00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:15.140
It's kind of an interesting
Rorschach test.

00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:17.100
So here's Larry talking.

00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:20.030
"I'm talking about greatness,
about taking a lever to the

00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:23.020
world and moving it, Larry said
walking the grounds of

00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:26.450
his new Woodside property with
his best friend, Steve Jobs.

00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:28.780
I'm not talking about
moral perfection.

00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:32.159
I'm talking about people who
changed the world the most

00:08:32.159 --> 00:08:34.360
during their lifetime.

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:37.220
Jobs, who had returned to Apple
three years earlier,

00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:40.709
enjoyed the conversational
volleying and placed Leonardo

00:08:40.709 --> 00:08:45.000
da Vinci and Gandhi as
his top choices, with

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.810
Gandhi in the lead.

00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:51.110
Leonardo, a great artist and an
inventor lived in violent

00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:54.590
times and was a designer of
tanks, battlements, ramparts,

00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:57.700
and an assortment of other
military tools, and castle

00:08:57.700 --> 00:08:59.320
fortifications.

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:02.850
Larry joked that had Leonardo
not been gay, he would have

00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:05.130
been quote unquote, 'a perfect
fit for the Bush

00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:09.750
administration.' Jobs who had
studied in India cited

00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:12.860
Gandhi's doctrine of nonviolent
revolution as an

00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:17.000
example of how it was possible
to remain morally pure while

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.800
aggressively pursuing change.

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:23.970
Larry's choice for history's
greatest person could not have

00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:27.240
been more different
from Gandhi.

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:30.010
His choice was the Corsican-born
military leader,

00:09:30.010 --> 00:09:32.390
Napoleon Bonaparte."

00:09:32.390 --> 00:09:33.370
Here's Larry talking.

00:09:33.370 --> 00:09:36.310
'Napoleon overthrew kings and
tyrants throughout Europe,

00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:39.460
created a system of free public
schools, and wrote one

00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:41.610
set of laws that apply
to everybody.

00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:45.770
Napoleon achieved liberal ends
through conservative means,'

00:09:45.770 --> 00:09:47.020
Larry argued.

00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:52.150
Steve and Larry argued
about everything,

00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:53.530
including music and art.

00:09:53.530 --> 00:09:55.780
When Larry said he thought Paul
Simon's lyrics for 'The

00:09:55.780 --> 00:10:01.640
Boxer' were brilliant, Steve
laughed and said Larry didn't

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:03.940
know goodness from greatness.

00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:07.870
Dylan, Job's said, is the
genius of our time.

00:10:07.870 --> 00:10:08.570
It never stopped.

00:10:08.570 --> 00:10:12.010
No one gave in, and they both
enjoy the rallying.

00:10:12.010 --> 00:10:15.210
Before Larry and Steve parted
ways, Larry mentioned recent

00:10:15.210 --> 00:10:18.160
regattas he had won on
'Sayonara.' And he talked

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:21.820
about the America's Cup race
he was readying for.

00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:26.220
Steve was interested in
materials and the innovations,

00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:29.450
whether the Mylar used on the
sails, or the grade of carbon

00:10:29.450 --> 00:10:31.420
fiber in the hulls.

00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:35.090
Part of Larry's job, as he saw
it, was to tempt and corrupt

00:10:35.090 --> 00:10:37.570
his friend with boats and planes
so that he would have

00:10:37.570 --> 00:10:39.530
more fun and more time.

00:10:39.530 --> 00:10:42.860
Steve was always concerned about
conspicuous consumption.

00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:47.620
He likes cars and motorcycles
but never spent a lot money.

00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:51.700
What he loved was designing and
redesigning things to make

00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:53.900
them more useful and
more beautiful."

00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:57.120
I think this is a neat
little anecdote here.

00:10:57.120 --> 00:11:00.370
"Larry was on the Apple Board
in 2000 when he had the idea

00:11:00.370 --> 00:11:04.580
that Apple should give Steve a
$40 million Gulfstream jet, so

00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:06.550
he could more efficiently
take his family to

00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:08.370
Hawaii for long weekends.

00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:12.290
Immediately, Steve started
designing the interior of his

00:11:12.290 --> 00:11:15.890
new plane, studying Larry's
Gulfstream and making

00:11:15.890 --> 00:11:19.130
improvements on Larry's
design.

00:11:19.130 --> 00:11:22.430
When he noticed that Larry had
one button to open a door and

00:11:22.430 --> 00:11:23.640
another button to close it--"

00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:25.720
Can you imagine?

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:29.450
"Steve decided on a single
toggle switch that would do

00:11:29.450 --> 00:11:31.660
both on his plane.

00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:35.380
Steve reversed the placement of
the sink and shower in the

00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:38.490
bathroom on his plane
among other changes.

00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:41.690
Larry agreed that Steve's
redesigns were improvements.

00:11:41.690 --> 00:11:44.640
Larry, sure he would eventually
hook his best

00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:49.800
friend on the draw the sea, also
lent Steve his boat for

00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:51.940
family vacations.

00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:54.770
Steve returned home after 10
days aboard 'Katana' and

00:11:54.770 --> 00:11:57.800
enthused, no one bothers
you on the boat.

00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:01.890
You can read and think and watch
the sky change colors at

00:12:01.890 --> 00:12:03.410
the end of the day.

00:12:03.410 --> 00:12:07.490
Soon Steve was showing Larry
designs for his beautiful boat

00:12:07.490 --> 00:12:09.830
to be named 'Aqua.'

00:12:09.830 --> 00:12:12.560
Well, the boat didn't end up
being named 'Aqua.' It's

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:15.520
called 'Venus.' And it's my
belief it was recently

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:20.630
completed, and that Lorraine
and their family

00:12:20.630 --> 00:12:22.410
is enjoying it now.

00:12:22.410 --> 00:12:24.950
But that was one thing that
Larry was able to, quote

00:12:24.950 --> 00:12:27.890
unquote, 'corrupt' his
best friend about."

00:12:27.890 --> 00:12:29.690
So now we're going to
move quickly back to

00:12:29.690 --> 00:12:30.650
the America's Cup.

00:12:30.650 --> 00:12:33.420
And I included the Steve Jobs,
Larry Ellison scene.

00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:36.210
And there's also a scene at
Steve's memorial service,

00:12:36.210 --> 00:12:38.300
which has never been
reported before.

00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:41.310
Because the book is very
much about dreamers.

00:12:41.310 --> 00:12:44.560
And it's about finding
innovations in whatever you

00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:46.940
do, which Joseph is going
to talk about.

00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:50.320
So this is a very, very small
vignette that I'm going to

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:54.270
read about "America," the
first boat that won the

00:12:54.270 --> 00:12:58.280
America's Cup for the United
States in 1851.

00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:01.340
And it's going to be a great
contrast to the boat that

00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:02.560
Joseph is going to talk about.

00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:05.770
And then I'm going to read one
little final vignette about--

00:13:05.770 --> 00:13:08.360
How are we doing on time?

00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:17.880
So this boat was built in 1840s
for around $20,000.

00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:22.310
And the boat that won the
America's Cup that raced

00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:27.070
basically for two races was
a $40 million boat.

00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:30.240
So there have been a
few advancements in

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:31.620
that regard, as well.

00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:38.050
So this is a little vignette
about "America."

00:13:38.050 --> 00:13:41.550
"'America,' offered up as United
States' finest display

00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:45.660
of innovation on the water was
a 95-foot, black, gaff-rigged

00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:49.020
schooner with a concave bow,
low free board, and cotton

00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:52.820
sails, said to hold their shape
better than the flax

00:13:52.820 --> 00:13:56.860
sails of the British yachts and
shaped on the lines of a

00:13:56.860 --> 00:13:57.800
pilot boat.

00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:01.170
She had set sail from New York's
East River in June and

00:14:01.170 --> 00:14:04.880
was manned throughout her
Atlantic crossing by Captain

00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:08.240
WH Brown and a crew of 12 men.

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:11.960
Brown had built 'America'
for $20,000 in cash.

00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:14.770
The Marquis of Anglesey, a
member of the Royal Yacht

00:14:14.770 --> 00:14:18.240
Squadron formed in 1815, and
the first club in England

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:22.510
granted the royal designation,
took one look at 'America' and

00:14:22.510 --> 00:14:25.920
said, if she is right,
we are all wrong.

00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:29.430
And another Brit remarked that
'America' looked like a, quote

00:14:29.430 --> 00:14:32.560
unquote, 'hawk among
pigeons.'"

00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:36.940
So now we're going to move
to the final little

00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:38.810
vignette that have.

00:14:38.810 --> 00:14:43.190
And if "America" was a "hawk
among pigeons," then we'll

00:14:43.190 --> 00:14:46.690
have to come up with good
descriptives for this "USA

00:14:46.690 --> 00:14:51.060
17." Larry called it his
black pterodactyl.

00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:54.370
And, you know, it would
certainly be up there with a

00:14:54.370 --> 00:14:58.180
peregrine falcon, going
back to the birds.

00:14:58.180 --> 00:15:01.490
So this is where Joseph's
story really comes

00:15:01.490 --> 00:15:02.700
in into this book.

00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:04.860
Although, he had been
engineering and designing

00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:06.440
boats for years before.

00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:11.900
But so this when Oracle Racing
has lost twice, 2003, 2007.

00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:15.030
Larry's been called a chump,
been likened to a modern day

00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:16.420
Sir Thomas Lipton.

00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:18.790
And he came back with what
he thought would

00:15:18.790 --> 00:15:19.960
be a winning formula.

00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:23.370
And that was, hire Russell
Coutts, the winningest skipper

00:15:23.370 --> 00:15:25.170
in America's Cup history.

00:15:25.170 --> 00:15:27.420
And build a boat, the
likes of which had

00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:30.300
never been seen before.

00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:33.800
So this is a pretty exciting
part of the story.

00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:37.290
"One month after the issue of
the venue was decided, 50 men

00:15:37.290 --> 00:15:40.160
and two enormous cranes came
together on the San Diego

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:43.810
docks to hoist a brand new rigid
wing, made of carbon

00:15:43.810 --> 00:15:47.480
fiber and Kevlar and wrapped
in white aeronautical film

00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:49.650
onto 'USA 17.'

00:15:49.650 --> 00:15:56.830
The wing had grown from 150 feet
to 196 feet, to 206 feet,

00:15:56.830 --> 00:16:01.860
and finally to an astounding
230 feet.

00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:05.860
At 23 stories, it was too
tall to fit under

00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:07.820
the Golden Gate Bridge.

00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:11.840
The wing was approximately the
same area as a football field,

00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:14.910
but as fragile as an egg.

00:16:14.910 --> 00:16:17.990
To better understand the power
of the rigid wing, Jimmy

00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:21.470
Spithill had spent two
weeks taking an

00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:25.140
intensive course in flying.

00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:28.320
He figured the best way to learn
to sail this aerodynamic

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:31.610
wonder was to get his
pilot's license.

00:16:31.610 --> 00:16:35.040
So on a rare break, he returned
home to Australia,

00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:38.010
visited a small country
airfield, and explained to the

00:16:38.010 --> 00:16:39.260
guys what he wanted to do.

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:42.480
His flight instructor, also a
sailor, took him out every day

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:46.350
for hours at a time in weather
that grounded other planes.

00:16:46.350 --> 00:16:49.250
Jimmy was immediately struck
by the similarities between

00:16:49.250 --> 00:16:50.870
flying and sailing.

00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:54.350
A well set-up plane, one driven
smoothly was easy to

00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:56.810
fly and had less drag.

00:16:56.810 --> 00:17:03.670
In the same way, a properly
balanced boat, trimmed well,

00:17:03.670 --> 00:17:05.900
was easy to sail.

00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:08.240
The experience hooked
him on flying.

00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:11.540
When Jimmy stepped aboard 'USA
17,' which they called 'The

00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:13.960
Beast,' he briefly looked up.

00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:17.960
It was as if someone had ripped
the wing off of a jet

00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:20.960
liner and placed
it on his boat.

00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:23.829
The plan for the day had been to
go out and take it slow and

00:17:23.829 --> 00:17:26.800
easy so the crew could gradually
began to get a feel

00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:29.380
for the huge winged sailboat.

00:17:29.380 --> 00:17:31.240
But the boat wanted to fly.

00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:35.630
And once Dirk de Ridder started
to trust the data,

00:17:35.630 --> 00:17:39.240
Jimmy felt like a jockey trying
to hold back his horse.

00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:42.080
He asked Scott Ferguson, a
designer on board, whether he

00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:46.270
could fly a hull and accelerate
'USA 17' to a much

00:17:46.270 --> 00:17:47.840
higher speed.

00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:50.870
'Now is a good a time
as any,' Ferguson

00:17:50.870 --> 00:17:53.400
said, holding his breath.

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:56.550
As the boat outperformed
anyone's expectations,

00:17:56.550 --> 00:17:59.160
Ferguson had tears
in his eyes.

00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:03.460
Joseph Ozanne and Mike Drummond
watched in awe as

00:18:03.460 --> 00:18:08.570
their experimental side project
became the main event.

00:18:08.570 --> 00:18:11.270
Larry had been told to get to
San Diego as soon as possible

00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:13.090
so he could see the wing sail.

00:18:13.090 --> 00:18:15.550
As he approached Lindbergh
Field, near the San Diego

00:18:15.550 --> 00:18:19.900
Harbor, he banked his CJ4
twin-jet over the harbor and

00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:20.640
looked down.

00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:24.400
That's when he saw the winged
trimaran for the first time.

00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:28.140
Seeing the boat from the air,
he thought to himself, oh my

00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:30.180
god, what have we done.

00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:33.390
This is madness.

00:18:33.390 --> 00:18:37.560
When 'USA 17' returned to the
docks, the entire team of

00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:40.290
engineers, builders, and
sailors were there.

00:18:40.290 --> 00:18:43.420
They still had a regatta to win
in Valencia, but they had

00:18:43.420 --> 00:18:48.030
already pulled off one of the
biggest engineering victories

00:18:48.030 --> 00:18:51.150
in maritime history."

00:18:51.150 --> 00:18:56.570
So Joseph is a very
interesting guy.

00:18:56.570 --> 00:18:59.560
And you're going to love seeing
the video, and hearing

00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:02.140
him talk, and asking
us questions after.

00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:09.390
But he was 29 when he joined
Oracle Racine in 2004.

00:19:09.390 --> 00:19:14.690
And he was told, after the
2007 loss, to go off and

00:19:14.690 --> 00:19:18.540
investigate this rigid wing and
see if this can be done.

00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:21.900
And mostly it was this--
what you call "the

00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:23.450
Utopian idea," right?

00:19:23.450 --> 00:19:26.510
That it was kind
of fantastical.

00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:31.170
And he had graduated from a very
prestigious university,

00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:35.800
Supra Aero, in France, which
was dedicated to aerospace.

00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:40.230
And there's a funny
story about--

00:19:40.230 --> 00:19:44.650
when I was talking with him that
he told me about how his

00:19:44.650 --> 00:19:47.810
professors used to rib him
about, why are you at an

00:19:47.810 --> 00:19:50.010
aerospace school when
you're interested in

00:19:50.010 --> 00:19:52.000
studying boat design.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.510
And so why was that?

00:19:54.510 --> 00:19:58.280
What was it for you that was
so interesting about boats?

00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:00.100
JOSEPH OZANNE: First because
there is no other option.

00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:03.100
Because finding a good school
for learning boat

00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:04.740
design is not easy.

00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:09.430
And also because now,
I mean, a boat is

00:20:09.430 --> 00:20:11.000
such a complex machine.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:16.400
But it's the same physics
behind that.

00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:18.625
And you've got wings on the
sail boat, except that the

00:20:18.625 --> 00:20:19.420
wings, instead of being

00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:21.740
horizontal, are being vertical.

00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:25.400
And now we've got even it's
aerodynamic, hydrodynamics.

00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:27.170
So it's the same concept
behind that.

00:20:27.170 --> 00:20:30.310
So it's a great way to learn.

00:20:30.310 --> 00:20:34.700
I mean, aircraft have been
designed for years and years.

00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:37.890
And they are just very
nice machines now.

00:20:37.890 --> 00:20:42.800
And as a boat designer you try
to use what's done on this

00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:47.300
field and to apply all the
techniques of aeronautics in

00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:48.140
the boat design.

00:20:48.140 --> 00:20:52.370
It's just like amazing because
we can do great things.

00:20:52.370 --> 00:20:55.280
And we have now, the machine
you're going to see on the

00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:57.670
video are just amazing.

00:20:57.670 --> 00:21:00.120
And it's just like a
little aircraft.

00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:03.280
So it literally flies
above the water.

00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:07.420
JULIAN GUTHRIE: So the wing sail
that reached 230 feet,

00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:09.510
the largest wing ever
built for air

00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:11.880
or for sea was largely--

00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:13.320
there were other people
working on it.

00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:17.720
But Joseph, again, took it from
this Utopian vision to a

00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:22.840
reality that that boat, the
likes of which will not be

00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:23.400
seen again.

00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:27.280
But so now, how does what you
learned there apply to what

00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:27.810
we're going to see?

00:21:27.810 --> 00:21:29.560
Because we're going to
see this video clip.

00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:31.630
A little bit, you'll see
the end of 2010.

00:21:31.630 --> 00:21:34.490
You'll see "USA 17," the
trimaran, and then you'll see

00:21:34.490 --> 00:21:36.180
these new boats.

00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:39.210
JOSEPH OZANNE: Yeah, so
basically when we design a

00:21:39.210 --> 00:21:41.170
boat that means the way we
work and when we race,

00:21:41.170 --> 00:21:44.100
especially America's Cup, the
only thing that matters for

00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:45.980
us, is being fast
on the water.

00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:50.490
So whatever we do,
we just do it for

00:21:50.490 --> 00:21:51.770
being faster and faster.

00:21:51.770 --> 00:21:54.160
So the speed is really
the only criteria

00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:55.322
we're looking at.

00:21:55.322 --> 00:21:59.180
And at the end, so
when we saw--

00:21:59.180 --> 00:22:01.100
when we designed "USA
17," there was

00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:03.020
no rigid wing, initially.

00:22:03.020 --> 00:22:05.900
And we just looked for
a solution to go even

00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:08.070
faster on the water.

00:22:08.070 --> 00:22:13.960
And the rigid wing was a
solution that was maybe was

00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:14.790
kind of obvious.

00:22:14.790 --> 00:22:17.860
But it was just such
a project.

00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:21.280
And sure to scale it, it was a
bit of an unknown in terms of,

00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:23.600
was it feasible, was
it manageable.

00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:27.590
And at the end of the day,
I mean, we design

00:22:27.590 --> 00:22:28.490
and build this wing.

00:22:28.490 --> 00:22:30.540
And it's like it
was a success.

00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:33.760
I mean, thanks to that,
the America's Cup is--

00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:36.200
we won the America's Cup and the
America's Cup is here in

00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:37.330
San Francisco now.

00:22:37.330 --> 00:22:40.040
So it's just like a nice
story for that.

00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:41.080
JULIAN GUTHRIE: It
is a nice story.

00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:44.710
But also an interesting story
because it brings together

00:22:44.710 --> 00:22:47.400
part of the various parts of
an America's Cup team, the

00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:50.050
engineers, the builders,
and the sailors.

00:22:50.050 --> 00:22:55.310
And Joseph and his peers had
to work with the sailors to

00:22:55.310 --> 00:22:58.780
kind of help them understand
this new way of sailing that

00:22:58.780 --> 00:23:00.390
was very data driven.

00:23:00.390 --> 00:23:02.340
And can you talk a little
bit about that?

00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:04.726
JOSEPH OZANNE: What's
fascinating is so we have

00:23:04.726 --> 00:23:06.890
obviously some sailing
team which is an

00:23:06.890 --> 00:23:07.910
amazing sailing team.

00:23:07.910 --> 00:23:10.610
So we work with the best
sailors in the world.

00:23:10.610 --> 00:23:14.080
And it's just as an amateur
sailor, it's always very

00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:15.260
impressive to work
with these guys.

00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:15.292
You're all new.

00:23:15.292 --> 00:23:17.050
I mean, it's just like
you work with the

00:23:17.050 --> 00:23:19.290
best guy in this sport.

00:23:22.170 --> 00:23:25.390
So initially, I mean, we are
seen like engineers.

00:23:25.390 --> 00:23:29.370
So we are computer guys.

00:23:29.370 --> 00:23:31.830
On the paper we constantly
interact with them.

00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:37.690
So we spent a lot of time
talking to them and exchanging

00:23:37.690 --> 00:23:41.910
ideas and discussion about
what's happening on the water,

00:23:41.910 --> 00:23:43.970
what's happening on
the computer.

00:23:43.970 --> 00:23:46.980
Now what's really interesting
is so they kind of liked the

00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:49.980
idea of having a wing, but
obviously they had no

00:23:49.980 --> 00:23:51.070
idea how to use it.

00:23:51.070 --> 00:23:57.930
So first, our job is to model
the wing and model the boat.

00:23:57.930 --> 00:24:01.385
So we know how to trim it,
what's the best settings.

00:24:04.670 --> 00:24:07.670
And it's kind of weird
for them to have

00:24:07.670 --> 00:24:08.630
new tools like that.

00:24:08.630 --> 00:24:15.320
And so you have to tell
them how to use it.

00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:19.990
So you ended up in a situation
where you give advice, how to

00:24:19.990 --> 00:24:23.010
sail a boat, to the best guy
in the world, you know.

00:24:23.010 --> 00:24:26.810
So they've been doing his
job for years and years.

00:24:26.810 --> 00:24:29.490
And you ended up like, you know,
you should trim your

00:24:29.490 --> 00:24:31.270
boat or your wing that way.

00:24:31.270 --> 00:24:34.670
And said, your initial reaction
could've been, why

00:24:34.670 --> 00:24:35.580
are you telling me that.

00:24:35.580 --> 00:24:39.050
But then little by little you
build kind of a relationship

00:24:39.050 --> 00:24:43.640
and a trust between the sailors
and the designers.

00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:45.040
And you end up doing
great things.

00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:49.440
So again, it's really
an interaction with

00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:50.730
two different worlds.

00:24:50.730 --> 00:24:52.990
And that's great, but the
America's Cup is this

00:24:52.990 --> 00:24:56.550
technology being this bridge
between the two worlds.

00:24:56.550 --> 00:24:57.990
JULIAN GUTHRIE: Do you
want to show the--

00:24:57.990 --> 00:24:59.340
JOSEPH OZANNE: Yeah, I see we
could, I guess we'd have an

00:24:59.340 --> 00:25:00.780
idea of what we're
talking about.

00:25:11.890 --> 00:25:12.380
So obviously

00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:15.090
"} rigid wing is about the
farthest technology now.

00:25:15.090 --> 00:25:18.170
And it is a pretty well-known
technology.

00:25:18.170 --> 00:25:19.650
And we make a lot of
progress in that.

00:25:19.650 --> 00:25:22.930
And also now, the boats are
flying above the water.

00:25:22.930 --> 00:25:25.770
So you saw in the video
that you don't have

00:25:25.770 --> 00:25:27.470
any more hull immersed.

00:25:27.470 --> 00:25:29.840
So it's really a brand
new world,

00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:31.900
brand new era for sailing.

00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:34.040
And it's where for us, as a
designer, it's just like a

00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:36.510
super exciting challenge.

00:25:36.510 --> 00:25:41.070
And because we're bringing
sailing in a new dimension.

00:25:41.070 --> 00:25:43.270
So we need to work with this
sort of dimension.

00:25:43.270 --> 00:25:44.680
Now we can lift the boat
above the water.

00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:47.975
And we have problems
to solve exactly

00:25:47.975 --> 00:25:49.260
like in flight mechanics.

00:25:49.260 --> 00:25:52.510
So we need to work on stability
to be able to

00:25:52.510 --> 00:25:53.500
maintain the flight.

00:25:53.500 --> 00:25:55.060
And how we can drive
these things.

00:25:55.060 --> 00:25:58.580
And so it's really, really
the focus is--

00:25:58.580 --> 00:26:04.580
I mean, we didn't want to,
we didn't look for

00:26:04.580 --> 00:26:06.020
flying at any price.

00:26:06.020 --> 00:26:07.500
You know, just went
there because it

00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:09.300
was the fastest solution.

00:26:09.300 --> 00:26:10.920
So we just like--

00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:13.370
our approach, we just try
to design the boat.

00:26:13.370 --> 00:26:15.300
And we look for solutions.

00:26:15.300 --> 00:26:17.586
And you ended up with this
kind of machine.

00:26:17.586 --> 00:26:21.790
And I think this machine is
really a sailing machine.

00:26:21.790 --> 00:26:25.010
We can go two or three
times the wind speed.

00:26:25.010 --> 00:26:27.920
So whatever is the wind, we can
double or triple of the

00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:30.120
speed of the wind just
without any engine.

00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:35.250
So it's just like you ended up
with an incredible piece of

00:26:35.250 --> 00:26:35.840
technology.

00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:39.930
And this is, I think, the
fascinating part of our job is

00:26:39.930 --> 00:26:43.670
to be able to understand
how this very

00:26:43.670 --> 00:26:45.230
complex system works.

00:26:45.230 --> 00:26:50.450
So it's really a machine that
works in between two--

00:26:50.450 --> 00:26:52.165
I mean, you've got the air
and you've got the water.

00:26:52.165 --> 00:26:56.590
And so, I think, in my mind, it
is a bit more complex than

00:26:56.590 --> 00:26:58.880
even an aircraft, because
aircraft you

00:26:58.880 --> 00:26:59.325
only have air around.

00:26:59.325 --> 00:27:02.400
And it's just like always
symmetrical.

00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:04.290
In other words, staying
in the same direction.

00:27:04.290 --> 00:27:06.790
Where on the sailboat you need
to have the interaction

00:27:06.790 --> 00:27:08.640
between what's happening in the
air and what's happening

00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:09.622
in the water.

00:27:09.622 --> 00:27:13.160
And whatever you do, one part
is affecting the other one.

00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:19.190
So it's like whatever rudder
angle you give, or whatever

00:27:19.190 --> 00:27:23.250
change of direction you have,
it's going to affect the flow

00:27:23.250 --> 00:27:24.040
above as well.

00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:25.460
It's going to affect
the engine.

00:27:25.460 --> 00:27:26.460
So at the end--

00:27:26.460 --> 00:27:27.840
I mean, what [INAUDIBLE]
engine is going

00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:28.830
to affect the wing.

00:27:28.830 --> 00:27:32.490
So at the end, it's really a
complex equation to sort.

00:27:32.490 --> 00:27:36.850
And what's fascinating, and I
thing it was also fascinating

00:27:36.850 --> 00:27:39.020
to work with the sailors
for that purpose.

00:27:39.020 --> 00:27:42.850
Because we give them a machine,
but they have to

00:27:42.850 --> 00:27:44.150
understand how to use it.

00:27:44.150 --> 00:27:50.090
So it's really understanding
this equation.

00:27:50.090 --> 00:27:53.330
It's very complex and
very exciting.

00:27:53.330 --> 00:27:55.660
Because then, when you see this
kind of picture, and this

00:27:55.660 --> 00:27:57.820
kind of speed, I think
it's quite a success.

00:27:57.820 --> 00:28:02.000
And it's quite a good thing
for the sport, as well.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:02.600
So--

00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:05.800
JULIAN GUTHRIE: Well, now you
have a wing in the air, and

00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:08.290
then you have the wiglets
underneath.

00:28:08.290 --> 00:28:11.690
So you've got these wings above
and wings below that

00:28:11.690 --> 00:28:14.000
you're designing which
is very cool looking.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:15.700
JOSEPH OZANNE: That's why you
can learn from aircrafts

00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:18.770
because basically, we have
a wing, vertical

00:28:18.770 --> 00:28:19.860
to propel the boat.

00:28:19.860 --> 00:28:23.810
And now we reach some speeds
that we can lift the boat,

00:28:23.810 --> 00:28:25.610
exactly like a normal wing.

00:28:25.610 --> 00:28:27.090
You lift the boat
in the water.

00:28:27.090 --> 00:28:28.930
So we've got hydrofoils.

00:28:28.930 --> 00:28:31.055
And the boat roughly--
the one you saw--

00:28:31.055 --> 00:28:33.410
are roughly seven tons.

00:28:33.410 --> 00:28:35.750
The platform, plus the
wing, plus the crew.

00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:40.260
So you can lift, really, your
boat with a speed we are

00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:42.580
reaching, you can really lift
the boat above the water.

00:28:42.580 --> 00:28:46.185
So you ended up creating a seven
ton force to lift the

00:28:46.185 --> 00:28:49.680
weight of the boat from this
little horizontal wing that

00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:51.740
are below the water.

00:28:51.740 --> 00:28:57.030
So with maybe one or two square
meters of carbon, you

00:28:57.030 --> 00:29:00.050
can just literally fly
above the water.

00:29:00.050 --> 00:29:03.750
And you ended up reaching speeds
of 40, 45 knots, which

00:29:03.750 --> 00:29:05.270
is roughly 50 miles an hour.

00:29:05.270 --> 00:29:08.530
So it's really, I mean,
especially in San Francisco

00:29:08.530 --> 00:29:11.220
when you ride, I mean,
you sail along

00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:12.160
the Golden Gate Bridge.

00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:13.930
I think the limit on the
Golden Gate Bridge

00:29:13.930 --> 00:29:15.560
is 45 miles an hour.

00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:17.370
So you just go faster
than the cars.

00:29:17.370 --> 00:29:18.820
So it's just like--

00:29:18.820 --> 00:29:21.420
So it's quite interesting,
and it's quite

00:29:21.420 --> 00:29:23.690
fascinating for the purpose.

00:29:23.690 --> 00:29:25.890
JULIAN GUTHRIE: So is this
better than you imagined?

00:29:25.890 --> 00:29:28.800
Or is it like when you were
thinking about, I could be a

00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:32.440
part of this design team or
engineering team, or how far

00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:34.510
the design in the
sport has gone?

00:29:34.510 --> 00:29:35.320
I mean--

00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:36.690
JOSEPH OZANNE: I think
the sky is the limit.

00:29:36.690 --> 00:29:38.990
Normally, you can go,
I mean, we can--

00:29:38.990 --> 00:29:40.620
JULIAN GUTHRIE: The
sky is the limit.

00:29:40.620 --> 00:29:42.420
JOSEPH OZANNE: Yeah, the thing
is, basically you try always.

00:29:42.420 --> 00:29:44.390
I mean, we do everything
we can to go faster.

00:29:44.390 --> 00:29:47.620
And what's interesting here is
inside the America's Cup you

00:29:47.620 --> 00:29:48.640
still have a rule to follow.

00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:51.710
So we've got to search
the pages, document

00:29:51.710 --> 00:29:53.020
that gives the rules.

00:29:53.020 --> 00:29:55.300
So everybody has, more or
less, the same boat.

00:29:55.300 --> 00:29:58.720
So as an engineer, it's very
interesting because you need

00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:01.790
to be the fastest possible
inside this rule.

00:30:01.790 --> 00:30:08.010
But so this is why we didn't
start it from scratch.

00:30:08.010 --> 00:30:11.810
So we just have a basic
set of rules.

00:30:11.810 --> 00:30:13.800
And our work is to go
as fast as possible.

00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:15.430
Again, that's pretty basic.

00:30:15.430 --> 00:30:17.850
But the only thing we try to
do is just to go faster.

00:30:20.390 --> 00:30:24.940
So that's why we are really
at the beginning of

00:30:24.940 --> 00:30:26.450
a new era in sailing.

00:30:26.450 --> 00:30:29.320
So I'm pretty sure
we can improve.

00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:32.900
And I'm pretty sure we can
have even better design.

00:30:32.900 --> 00:30:34.910
But the technology and the,
I mean, this summer

00:30:34.910 --> 00:30:35.600
is going to be great.

00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:39.550
Because we're going to have
several teams that work

00:30:39.550 --> 00:30:40.770
individually on these designs.

00:30:40.770 --> 00:30:42.540
So we can have competition.

00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:44.180
You saw, we have
two boats here.

00:30:44.180 --> 00:30:46.750
So we have already some internal
competition just to

00:30:46.750 --> 00:30:48.090
get up to speed.

00:30:48.090 --> 00:30:53.220
But every day we go sailing, and
we just learn new stuff.

00:30:53.220 --> 00:30:55.310
And it's a new dimension
for that.

00:30:55.310 --> 00:30:57.940
So I think it's great
for the sport.

00:30:57.940 --> 00:30:59.480
It's going to be awesome.

00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:00.960
In September, we're going
to see what's happening.

00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:02.230
JULIAN GUTHRIE: Oh, we'll see.

00:31:02.230 --> 00:31:03.780
We'll see how your designs
do, right?

00:31:03.780 --> 00:31:04.720
JOSEPH OZANNE: Exactly.

00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:06.700
JULIAN GUTHRIE: So I know we
wanted to have some time to

00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:09.800
open it up for questions.

00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:12.510
So who has questions
for either of us?

00:31:12.510 --> 00:31:14.630
AUDIENCE: The original
class rules

00:31:14.630 --> 00:31:15.920
didn't anticipate foiling.

00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:18.300
And obviously, the kiwis
figured that out.

00:31:18.300 --> 00:31:19.810
And now everyone's followed.

00:31:19.810 --> 00:31:22.080
Could you elaborate a
little bit on how--

00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:24.780
is that just because you're able
to get more lift than was

00:31:24.780 --> 00:31:25.770
anticipated?

00:31:25.770 --> 00:31:26.990
Or can you talk a little
about how the

00:31:26.990 --> 00:31:28.830
transition to foiling happened?

00:31:28.830 --> 00:31:35.510
JOSEPH OZANNE: I think it's a
natural development in a sense

00:31:35.510 --> 00:31:38.660
that again, what we try to
do is to reduce drag.

00:31:38.660 --> 00:31:42.740
So basically, our main
job is to reduce the

00:31:42.740 --> 00:31:44.450
drag as much as possible.

00:31:44.450 --> 00:31:47.020
And what's happening is
one big source of

00:31:47.020 --> 00:31:48.740
drag is the hull itself.

00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:53.290
So traditionally, foiling is not
new in the sailing world.

00:31:53.290 --> 00:31:55.580
And there have been
foilers before.

00:31:55.580 --> 00:31:58.680
So it's a natural thing to
try to lift the boat.

00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:02.760
And initially in the rule, the
people that wrote the rule

00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:07.230
said try to avoid that because
it's kind of a bit dangerous

00:32:07.230 --> 00:32:09.940
and it's a bit tricky to manage,
but to try to that.

00:32:09.940 --> 00:32:15.160
But I mean, if you got the
way to do that anyway.

00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:18.740
And so the Kiwi were the first
one to really speak true of

00:32:18.740 --> 00:32:19.420
the foiling.

00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:23.160
We've been sailing on our
smaller catamarans and we've

00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:24.250
been foiling as well.

00:32:24.250 --> 00:32:28.410
So it's just like, we did a
lot of experiments on the

00:32:28.410 --> 00:32:31.510
45-footer, which is the smallest
kind of this boat.

00:32:31.510 --> 00:32:35.920
And so it's just a natural
development.

00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:38.500
Because you try to reduce drag,
you end up foiling.

00:32:38.500 --> 00:32:43.085
And you figure out a solution
to be able to foil and fly

00:32:43.085 --> 00:32:44.700
inside the rule.

00:32:44.700 --> 00:32:49.490
So it's kind of whenever
we do fast materials,

00:32:49.490 --> 00:32:50.770
you end up in this--

00:32:50.770 --> 00:32:54.180
I'm pretty sure, we can end up
in this kind of situation.

00:32:54.180 --> 00:32:56.160
And I'm pretty sure we're going
to see more and more

00:32:56.160 --> 00:32:57.590
boats like that.

00:32:57.590 --> 00:33:00.482
Because it's just like,
it's faster.

00:33:00.482 --> 00:33:01.732
So.

00:33:03.650 --> 00:33:05.820
AUDIENCE: You mentioned the
constraints that are

00:33:05.820 --> 00:33:09.450
introduced by the rules
of the race.

00:33:09.450 --> 00:33:14.270
And also I mean, I'm not a big
expert on the America's Cup,

00:33:14.270 --> 00:33:15.880
but I'm noticing
a lot of people

00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:18.370
running around the boat.

00:33:18.370 --> 00:33:20.850
Obviously, you know sailing is a
team sport, and all of that.

00:33:20.850 --> 00:33:24.695
But let's say that you had
absolute freedom to remove all

00:33:24.695 --> 00:33:26.470
of those constraints.

00:33:26.470 --> 00:33:30.480
And are there chances that
that will change?

00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:33.500
The constraints will change over
time, based on the new

00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:34.570
designs and so on.

00:33:34.570 --> 00:33:37.670
And the second one, are those
people really still needed?

00:33:37.670 --> 00:33:41.320
Can you, like, replace
them with--

00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:41.810
JULIAN GUTHRIE: Technology?

00:33:41.810 --> 00:33:44.250
AUDIENCE: Or is it just because
of the tradition?

00:33:44.250 --> 00:33:45.560
JOSEPH OZANNE: So to answer
the first part of the

00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:51.750
question, I mean, that's
interesting in America's Cup

00:33:51.750 --> 00:33:53.000
is we're still racing.

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:54.310
So we have a race course.

00:33:54.310 --> 00:33:58.050
And so we need to go upwind,
we need to go downwind.

00:33:58.050 --> 00:34:01.580
So we need to have
a proper race.

00:34:01.580 --> 00:34:03.260
So there is a lot
of compromise.

00:34:03.260 --> 00:34:05.935
So you can tune a boat for going
upwind, you can tune

00:34:05.935 --> 00:34:07.040
your boat for downwind.

00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:10.159
And it's very interesting
because you have to trade off

00:34:10.159 --> 00:34:13.199
the different operating
conditions.

00:34:13.199 --> 00:34:15.710
And depending on what you do,
you could end up with

00:34:15.710 --> 00:34:16.830
different design.

00:34:16.830 --> 00:34:19.120
For example our two boats, they
are slightly different in

00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:19.820
terms of tuning.

00:34:19.820 --> 00:34:22.060
So one is better upwind,
one is better downwind.

00:34:22.060 --> 00:34:26.780
So we need to figure out which
one is the best solution.

00:34:26.780 --> 00:34:29.080
So we don't do a boat
for speed record.

00:34:29.080 --> 00:34:31.469
If you have to do a boat
for speed record.

00:34:31.469 --> 00:34:32.245
And they can go faster.

00:34:32.245 --> 00:34:35.090
The speed record right
now is like 65 knots,

00:34:35.090 --> 00:34:36.250
something like that.

00:34:36.250 --> 00:34:38.429
But it's a machine that
couldn't-- it's impossible to

00:34:38.429 --> 00:34:39.320
sail in the Bay.

00:34:39.320 --> 00:34:41.179
So we really have an envelope.

00:34:41.179 --> 00:34:45.270
And I see America's Cup
is still a race.

00:34:45.270 --> 00:34:47.943
So you're going to have mark
rounding, and you're going to

00:34:47.943 --> 00:34:49.400
have a starting line
and finishing line.

00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:51.120
And you're going to have to work
upwind and downwind so to

00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:52.230
sail inside the rules.

00:34:52.230 --> 00:34:55.730
So I don't think this envelope
will disappear.

00:34:55.730 --> 00:34:59.740
And the second part of your
question was more about

00:34:59.740 --> 00:35:02.520
simulation, right?

00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:05.160
AUDIENCE: Like the people
that operate the boat.

00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:05.430
JOSEPH OZANNE: Exactly.

00:35:05.430 --> 00:35:10.180
So what's interesting here is
for us, I mean, we struggled

00:35:10.180 --> 00:35:15.700
to model how to drive a boat.

00:35:15.700 --> 00:35:20.880
So if you give to a computer the
power to drive the boat,

00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:22.980
it's not that easy to do.

00:35:22.980 --> 00:35:25.720
And the guys, they are
just incredible.

00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:28.550
They feel the wind, how to
react, anticipate, and

00:35:28.550 --> 00:35:28.950
everything.

00:35:28.950 --> 00:35:33.530
And we're still at the level
where I don't think we are

00:35:33.530 --> 00:35:36.870
really able to capture
the skills of

00:35:36.870 --> 00:35:38.470
the sailors for that.

00:35:38.470 --> 00:35:40.900
So we still need them
to go fast.

00:35:40.900 --> 00:35:42.870
And they are extremely
good for that.

00:35:42.870 --> 00:35:44.510
So when we give them
a machine.

00:35:44.510 --> 00:35:45.990
They are able to say, OK.

00:35:45.990 --> 00:35:47.690
That's what we can
do with that.

00:35:47.690 --> 00:35:48.360
We can't.

00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:52.230
So that sets the envelope
of performance.

00:35:52.230 --> 00:35:55.930
And so you still want people
involved, first

00:35:55.930 --> 00:35:56.770
because it's a sport.

00:35:56.770 --> 00:36:00.620
So you want people involved.

00:36:00.620 --> 00:36:03.580
But also because it's still
the fastest solution.

00:36:03.580 --> 00:36:09.980
So what's happening is it's
interesting because in my few

00:36:09.980 --> 00:36:15.970
times I met people from Formula
One industry or from

00:36:15.970 --> 00:36:18.520
the aeronautic world, and I've
been asking more or less the

00:36:18.520 --> 00:36:23.720
same question is, how do you
model the human behavior to

00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:25.190
make sure that we
can understand

00:36:25.190 --> 00:36:26.860
exactly what's happening.

00:36:26.860 --> 00:36:32.500
And in Formula One, you
have a lot of money,

00:36:32.500 --> 00:36:33.720
and a lot of people.

00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:37.900
And even more in aeronautics
we're going Airbus or Boeing.

00:36:37.900 --> 00:36:42.530
Even these guys that still give
simulators to the pilots

00:36:42.530 --> 00:36:45.690
just to make sure that they
can collect proper

00:36:45.690 --> 00:36:50.190
information, which proves that
you still need somebody to

00:36:50.190 --> 00:36:52.710
drive the machine and
to drive it faster.

00:36:55.800 --> 00:36:57.050
AUDIENCE: So I get that part.

00:36:57.050 --> 00:36:58.200
Like you still get
the skipper.

00:36:58.200 --> 00:37:00.890
But like the people that are
just standing around pulling

00:37:00.890 --> 00:37:04.380
winches and just basically are
being used as a weight.

00:37:04.380 --> 00:37:08.293
Are those tradition?

00:37:08.293 --> 00:37:09.020
JOSEPH OZANNE: Yes.

00:37:09.020 --> 00:37:16.370
It's probably a tradition in a
sense that the only source of

00:37:16.370 --> 00:37:19.630
energy needs to be human.

00:37:19.630 --> 00:37:22.480
So we don't have any engine.

00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:26.220
So we use hydraulics
under the loads.

00:37:26.220 --> 00:37:29.650
But the hydraulic pumps are
driven by the sailors.

00:37:29.650 --> 00:37:31.960
AUDIENCE: In other words, can
you reduce the number of

00:37:31.960 --> 00:37:33.210
people significantly?

00:37:36.730 --> 00:37:39.260
JOSEPH OZANNE: Without human
power, it's going to be hard

00:37:39.260 --> 00:37:40.520
to trim the boat.

00:37:40.520 --> 00:37:43.350
So you need this because you
need a certain amount of

00:37:43.350 --> 00:37:45.320
energy to handle the loads.

00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:47.840
So on this boat, there
are 11 on board.

00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:51.620
And they would be happy
with more people.

00:37:51.620 --> 00:37:54.910
It's such hard work that
you need these guys.

00:37:54.910 --> 00:37:57.600
So without any external
source of energy, you

00:37:57.600 --> 00:37:58.650
will need these people.

00:37:58.650 --> 00:38:01.990
AUDIENCE: So you need all
11 to work this boat.

00:38:01.990 --> 00:38:03.630
If you put more, it's going
to be an overkill.

00:38:03.630 --> 00:38:06.312
If you put less, it's basically
going to be--

00:38:06.312 --> 00:38:07.730
so it's an optimized solution?

00:38:07.730 --> 00:38:08.330
JOSEPH OZANNE: Exactly.

00:38:08.330 --> 00:38:11.320
Because if you put less, you
could have less people to be

00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:12.420
able to trim the
boat, so you're

00:38:12.420 --> 00:38:13.760
probably going to be slower.

00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:17.650
If you put more, you add
weight, which is--

00:38:17.650 --> 00:38:19.430
you try to be as light
as possible.

00:38:19.430 --> 00:38:23.570
So yes, at the end, it's
a good compromise.

00:38:23.570 --> 00:38:26.320
But again, it's still
a sailboat.

00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:30.200
So you need to only use human
power and the wind just to go.

00:38:33.030 --> 00:38:33.405
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:38:33.405 --> 00:38:35.910
Is there an optimal amount
for the book to heel?

00:38:35.910 --> 00:38:37.670
I noticed in the video that
sometimes, the upwind

00:38:37.670 --> 00:38:40.060
hydrofoil is in the water,
but not always.

00:38:40.060 --> 00:38:41.620
Do you want it in there for
the control surface?

00:38:41.620 --> 00:38:42.110
Or out for less drag?

00:38:42.110 --> 00:38:44.020
Can you talk about those
kinds of issues.

00:38:44.020 --> 00:38:44.310
JOSEPH OZANNE: Yeah.

00:38:44.310 --> 00:38:49.830
So what's happening
is so the boat--

00:38:49.830 --> 00:38:52.070
as I was mentioning earlier--
it's a very complex machine.

00:38:52.070 --> 00:38:54.100
So you need to find the proper
balance between what's

00:38:54.100 --> 00:38:55.570
happening above the
water and what's

00:38:55.570 --> 00:38:57.190
happening below the water.

00:38:57.190 --> 00:39:00.570
And obviously when you go
against the wind, when you go

00:39:00.570 --> 00:39:07.560
upwind, it's intuitively you go
maybe slower because you're

00:39:07.560 --> 00:39:09.130
going against the wind.

00:39:09.130 --> 00:39:13.620
And so the speed you are
reaching are slower.

00:39:13.620 --> 00:39:17.460
I mean, even if upwind, we still
go 20, 25 knots upwind,

00:39:17.460 --> 00:39:19.020
so against the wind.

00:39:19.020 --> 00:39:23.600
And so overall, you go slower.

00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:25.950
So you're going to need
to generate--

00:39:25.950 --> 00:39:29.780
I mean, it's harder to generate
the lift to lift the

00:39:29.780 --> 00:39:31.920
boat above the water.

00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:35.600
So, you've got a trade off
between the amount of--

00:39:35.600 --> 00:39:38.180
I mean, when you create
a force, it's

00:39:38.180 --> 00:39:39.220
going to create drag.

00:39:39.220 --> 00:39:43.210
So if you need to create the
seven tons on the foil upwind,

00:39:43.210 --> 00:39:47.070
it's possible, but it can
obviously create some drag.

00:39:47.070 --> 00:39:49.270
And then, you're going
to lift your hull.

00:39:49.270 --> 00:39:52.060
And you are going to reduce
the drag of the hull.

00:39:52.060 --> 00:39:55.640
So it's a trade-off between
how much you reduce the

00:39:55.640 --> 00:39:59.960
hydrodrag and how much drag you
add by creating this force

00:39:59.960 --> 00:40:00.780
on the foil.

00:40:00.780 --> 00:40:04.840
So roughly, I mean, right now
with these boats, when you go

00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:07.610
upwind you still have
the leeward

00:40:07.610 --> 00:40:08.805
hull is still immersed.

00:40:08.805 --> 00:40:12.555
And when you go downwind, we're
able to fly with winds

00:40:12.555 --> 00:40:15.950
of 10 knots.

00:40:15.950 --> 00:40:18.570
We can already be foiling.

00:40:18.570 --> 00:40:19.360
So it's--

00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:20.610
yeah.

00:40:22.080 --> 00:40:23.605
It's all a matter
of compromises.

00:40:23.605 --> 00:40:26.410
It's a trade-off between the
upwind and downwind and the

00:40:26.410 --> 00:40:27.660
conditions.

00:40:30.220 --> 00:40:31.440
AUDIENCE: I have
two questions.

00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:34.410
One, the Bay is notorious for
its conditions in terms of

00:40:34.410 --> 00:40:36.100
wind changes and so forth.

00:40:36.100 --> 00:40:40.460
So I'm just wondering how much
that went into your design.

00:40:40.460 --> 00:40:41.820
And then a complete different
question, you

00:40:41.820 --> 00:40:43.100
talked about racing.

00:40:43.100 --> 00:40:45.720
Over time, stuff developed in
racing cars has come down to

00:40:45.720 --> 00:40:47.570
ordinary independent
suspension,

00:40:47.570 --> 00:40:48.590
various things like this.

00:40:48.590 --> 00:40:53.080
When can I expect a winged sail
on my 35 foot keel boat?

00:40:53.080 --> 00:40:55.340
JOSEPH OZANNE: I will be very
happy to put one on your boat

00:40:55.340 --> 00:40:56.590
if you want.

00:41:00.060 --> 00:41:05.810
I mean, honestly, especially for
the sailing community, I

00:41:05.810 --> 00:41:07.940
think it's much simpler
to handle.

00:41:07.940 --> 00:41:11.190
So it's easier to sail, easier
to understand, you can

00:41:11.190 --> 00:41:14.960
maneuver your boat with
more efficiency.

00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:18.800
So obviously, logistically
it's a bit complex.

00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:23.070
So if you can solve the
logistical issue, I'm pretty

00:41:23.070 --> 00:41:25.350
sure that it can.

00:41:25.350 --> 00:41:27.840
We see more and more
rigid wings.

00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:31.710
And the good thing about the
America's Cup it's good

00:41:31.710 --> 00:41:32.750
publicity for these wings.

00:41:32.750 --> 00:41:37.070
And probably in the future
you can see that.

00:41:37.070 --> 00:41:42.890
And I will even be happy to put
wings on a cargo ship or

00:41:42.890 --> 00:41:47.130
something like that
just to save gas.

00:41:47.130 --> 00:41:49.190
So it's just like a
kind of solution

00:41:49.190 --> 00:41:51.070
which is quite reliable.

00:41:51.070 --> 00:41:53.210
And regarding your other
question about the conditions

00:41:53.210 --> 00:41:57.010
in the bay, I mean, we spend
a lot of time studying the

00:41:57.010 --> 00:41:59.860
condition, the current.

00:41:59.860 --> 00:42:03.440
We have historical data about
the previous years.

00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:05.620
And if somebody can tell me
what's going to be the weather

00:42:05.620 --> 00:42:07.220
on the seventh of September.

00:42:07.220 --> 00:42:08.550
I mean, I'll take
the information

00:42:08.550 --> 00:42:10.030
straight away, you know.

00:42:10.030 --> 00:42:12.080
Because we can obviously
tune our boats, So

00:42:12.080 --> 00:42:13.180
it's a bit of an unknown.

00:42:13.180 --> 00:42:14.640
But I would love to know
the weather in

00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:15.890
September for the race.

00:42:19.150 --> 00:42:20.720
AUDIENCE: So my question
is about to the

00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:23.010
technological advances.

00:42:23.010 --> 00:42:25.040
And obviously it's great to
see all of the engineering

00:42:25.040 --> 00:42:26.720
going into in those boats.

00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:30.510
But I feel like it makes it
harder for competitors to

00:42:30.510 --> 00:42:32.880
catch up, and more expensive
as well.

00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:37.580
In particular, we went from
twelve or so challengers to

00:42:37.580 --> 00:42:39.360
three this year.

00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:41.240
So what--

00:42:41.240 --> 00:42:42.340
JOSEPH OZANNE: Maybe
you should answer

00:42:42.340 --> 00:42:44.280
you know more the--

00:42:44.280 --> 00:42:46.340
AUDIENCE: So what do you see
the future of the America's

00:42:46.340 --> 00:42:47.380
Cup based on that?

00:42:47.380 --> 00:42:50.320
JULIAN GUTHRIE: I think there
will be a scaling back of the

00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:51.630
size of the boats.

00:42:51.630 --> 00:42:54.900
That's what Russell Coutts
has said to me.

00:42:54.900 --> 00:42:59.160
But I think that the going
from twelve contenders to

00:42:59.160 --> 00:43:03.180
three largely was a result of
the economy at the time and

00:43:03.180 --> 00:43:09.200
the mortgage crisis that spread
abroad and really

00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:12.920
caused global problems,
especially in Europe.

00:43:12.920 --> 00:43:16.850
And caused a number of the teams
that were in Europe to

00:43:16.850 --> 00:43:19.430
pull out of the race.

00:43:19.430 --> 00:43:23.870
So I think the objective from
what I've heard from key

00:43:23.870 --> 00:43:28.240
players, including Larry
Ellison, is to make this more

00:43:28.240 --> 00:43:28.960
accessible.

00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:32.830
I mean, it's never been
a race that has been

00:43:32.830 --> 00:43:34.540
accessible to all.

00:43:34.540 --> 00:43:38.230
The history of the America's Cup
is that you really need a

00:43:38.230 --> 00:43:39.010
fat wallet.

00:43:39.010 --> 00:43:42.140
And so I don't think that's
going to change.

00:43:42.140 --> 00:43:46.180
But I think the boats will be
scaled down a bit in size.

00:43:46.180 --> 00:43:48.850
That's what I've been told.

00:43:48.850 --> 00:43:51.610
Interestingly enough, so Russell
Coutts said to me that

00:43:51.610 --> 00:43:54.790
they had the AC45s, which
they used for the

00:43:54.790 --> 00:43:56.080
World Series regattas.

00:43:56.080 --> 00:44:00.490
But they needed a boat that
would look big enough, and

00:44:00.490 --> 00:44:05.260
imposing enough, and enough like
an America's Cup boat on

00:44:05.260 --> 00:44:05.920
television.

00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:09.160
Where you would see it and say,
this is definitely an

00:44:09.160 --> 00:44:10.400
America's Cup boat.

00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:13.820
And so they went to the 72s.

00:44:13.820 --> 00:44:18.540
But they found out, in
retrospect, that the AC45s

00:44:18.540 --> 00:44:22.830
were also really
fantastic-looking for the mass

00:44:22.830 --> 00:44:24.110
media market.

00:44:24.110 --> 00:44:29.570
So I think that there will be
a bit of a scaling down.

00:44:29.570 --> 00:44:30.880
What have you heard
about that?

00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:33.450
JOSEPH OZANNE: Also, obviously
we've got less competitors,

00:44:33.450 --> 00:44:36.320
but what we need to keep in
mind, is the level of

00:44:36.320 --> 00:44:38.220
competition is very high.

00:44:38.220 --> 00:44:42.500
So I mean it's still America's
Cup, and it's not easy to win.

00:44:42.500 --> 00:44:45.010
So we need to keep
that because it's

00:44:45.010 --> 00:44:46.450
still a tough challenge.

00:44:46.450 --> 00:44:52.290
And right now, even if we have
less teams, the level of

00:44:52.290 --> 00:44:53.810
racing is incredibly high.

00:44:53.810 --> 00:44:57.050
So it's going to be a
tough win, for sure.

00:44:57.050 --> 00:44:59.170
So this is one of the goals
of the America's Cup.

00:44:59.170 --> 00:45:03.230
And it's for sure, this is
going to be the case.

00:45:03.230 --> 00:45:06.780
JULIAN GUTHRIE: Jimmy Spithill
told me that in the past

00:45:06.780 --> 00:45:10.470
America's Cup you've had a
dozen contenders but only

00:45:10.470 --> 00:45:14.190
three or four really
viable competitors.

00:45:14.190 --> 00:45:16.960
And so now, you don't have that
dozen, but you have the

00:45:16.960 --> 00:45:20.360
really tough, viable competitors
that's that you're

00:45:20.360 --> 00:45:21.300
going up against.

00:45:21.300 --> 00:45:23.510
JOSEPH OZANNE: I mean, I've
been involved with the

00:45:23.510 --> 00:45:25.990
campaign with Oracle in 2007.

00:45:25.990 --> 00:45:30.380
And we had this group of-- we
called it the Big Four.

00:45:30.380 --> 00:45:32.860
So even if you have 12
competitors, we still have the

00:45:32.860 --> 00:45:34.755
Big Four which is really
the tough competitors.

00:45:34.755 --> 00:45:38.080
So you knew before that these
guys would be in the

00:45:38.080 --> 00:45:38.550
semi-finals.

00:45:38.550 --> 00:45:43.150
So again, maybe we went straight
to the Big Four.

00:45:43.150 --> 00:45:46.700
But it's just like, obviously,
there's some background that

00:45:46.700 --> 00:45:47.490
Julian described.

00:45:47.490 --> 00:45:50.390
So.

00:45:50.390 --> 00:45:53.310
AUDIENCE: So I have a comment
and a couple questions.

00:45:53.310 --> 00:45:55.570
And the comment is, do you think
that the-- or I guess

00:45:55.570 --> 00:45:58.330
it's a question-- do you think
that the viable competitors,

00:45:58.330 --> 00:46:03.210
is it a sport competition-type
competitiveness, or is it a

00:46:03.210 --> 00:46:04.800
financial competition?

00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:06.430
JULIAN GUTHRIE: It's
so multifaceted.

00:46:06.430 --> 00:46:08.340
So you have to have the
engineering, and

00:46:08.340 --> 00:46:09.210
the designing side.

00:46:09.210 --> 00:46:11.210
And then you have to have
the material part of it.

00:46:11.210 --> 00:46:13.430
The builders who know where
to get the best

00:46:13.430 --> 00:46:15.590
grade of carbon fiber.

00:46:15.590 --> 00:46:18.430
So it's all of those components
that you absolutely

00:46:18.430 --> 00:46:20.760
have to have, which makes
it so complex.

00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:23.800
And also so intellectually

00:46:23.800 --> 00:46:26.890
stimulating for those involved.

00:46:26.890 --> 00:46:29.240
JOSEPH OZANNE: I mean having
all that money around the

00:46:29.240 --> 00:46:31.710
America's Cup it helps to
develop this kind of

00:46:31.710 --> 00:46:32.320
technology.

00:46:32.320 --> 00:46:34.320
And we're going to see this
technology in the future on

00:46:34.320 --> 00:46:36.830
these kind of-- so it's help
improving the sport as well.

00:46:36.830 --> 00:46:40.530
So it's expensive, but in
comparison with the sport,

00:46:40.530 --> 00:46:42.150
it's not that expensive.

00:46:42.150 --> 00:46:45.930
AUDIENCE: How do you keep the
boat from flying completely

00:46:45.930 --> 00:46:47.650
out of the water and
losing control?

00:46:47.650 --> 00:46:51.460
JOSEPH OZANNE: We need to find
a subtle balance between--

00:46:51.460 --> 00:46:54.570
a boat is basically an
unstable machine.

00:46:54.570 --> 00:46:56.000
So it can capsize, it can.

00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:59.630
So we need to bring
some stability.

00:46:59.630 --> 00:47:03.940
And so we can, by playing with
the shape of the foils, we can

00:47:03.940 --> 00:47:04.990
bring some stability.

00:47:04.990 --> 00:47:07.340
So when the boat is
flying, you can

00:47:07.340 --> 00:47:10.400
maintain a stable flight.

00:47:10.400 --> 00:47:13.890
But this kind of foils
or this kind of

00:47:13.890 --> 00:47:17.480
shapes often is draggy.

00:47:17.480 --> 00:47:21.425
So it just kind of create
too much drag.

00:47:21.425 --> 00:47:24.450
So OK, it's flying, but
it's not that fast.

00:47:24.450 --> 00:47:27.950
So we need to find where to
put the cursor between the

00:47:27.950 --> 00:47:30.500
performance, the speed,
and the stability.

00:47:30.500 --> 00:47:33.540
So the sailors should be
comfortable at flying the boat

00:47:33.540 --> 00:47:35.310
and still be fast.

00:47:35.310 --> 00:47:40.390
So it's part of our research
and development

00:47:40.390 --> 00:47:42.730
to find this balance.

00:47:42.730 --> 00:47:47.140
And so overall, we ended up with
a situation where we've

00:47:47.140 --> 00:47:49.660
got a pretty unstable machine.

00:47:49.660 --> 00:47:54.680
And we've got some input from
the crew to maintain a flight.

00:47:54.680 --> 00:47:59.580
So for example, in our case, so
we've got this horizontal

00:47:59.580 --> 00:48:01.930
wing, hydrofoil.

00:48:01.930 --> 00:48:05.680
So it's a horizontal surface
that is immersed.

00:48:05.680 --> 00:48:08.100
And we can change the
angle of attack

00:48:08.100 --> 00:48:09.700
depending on the altitude.

00:48:09.700 --> 00:48:14.400
So basically the crew is playing
with this angle.

00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:20.280
So we can manually adjust the
flight from the crew.

00:48:20.280 --> 00:48:24.500
And so we need to find the
correct balance between

00:48:24.500 --> 00:48:25.820
stability and performance.

00:48:25.820 --> 00:48:30.470
And it is part of our
day to day job.

00:48:30.470 --> 00:48:32.190
AUDIENCE: Final question.

00:48:32.190 --> 00:48:34.096
Can I get a ride?

00:48:34.096 --> 00:48:36.580
JOSEPH OZANNE: Uh,
it's not my call.

00:48:36.580 --> 00:48:37.200
JULIAN GUTHRIE: It's fun.

00:48:37.200 --> 00:48:39.305
It's fun.

00:48:39.305 --> 00:48:40.520
It's something else.

00:48:40.520 --> 00:48:44.030
I was on one of the AC45s
and had quite a ride.

00:48:44.030 --> 00:48:44.340
Yeah.

00:48:44.340 --> 00:48:45.320
AUDIENCE: I'm jealous.

00:48:45.320 --> 00:48:45.810
JULIAN GUTHRIE: Yeah.

00:48:45.810 --> 00:48:47.570
It's great.

00:48:47.570 --> 00:48:48.710
JOSEPH OZANNE: You can come
and see the races.

00:48:48.710 --> 00:48:51.230
They're going to be
races tomorrow.

00:48:51.230 --> 00:48:51.800
JULIAN GUTHRIE: Yeah
the racing--

00:48:51.800 --> 00:48:52.690
JOSEPH OZANNE: Two race.

00:48:52.690 --> 00:48:53.950
JULIAN GUTHRIE: Two-boat
racing starts tomorrow.

00:48:53.950 --> 00:48:59.130
So check it out.

00:48:59.130 --> 00:49:01.460
AUDIENCE: You mentioned earlier
that when you went to

00:49:01.460 --> 00:49:03.930
the fixed wing that there was
sort of a negotiation period

00:49:03.930 --> 00:49:07.340
with sailors because they're
not used to flying that.

00:49:07.340 --> 00:49:11.410
So what were the most
significant ways in which you

00:49:11.410 --> 00:49:16.030
had to overcome a sailor's
natural inclinations?

00:49:16.030 --> 00:49:18.540
Basically, what are the
significant differences

00:49:18.540 --> 00:49:21.500
between flying a standard
sail and a fixed-wing.

00:49:21.500 --> 00:49:23.050
JOSEPH OZANNE: It's still
a sailboat, so

00:49:23.050 --> 00:49:24.450
it's doing the same.

00:49:24.450 --> 00:49:25.870
So you try to propel
your boat.

00:49:25.870 --> 00:49:28.970
So it's just doing the same
thing, except the tool you're

00:49:28.970 --> 00:49:32.350
using to create the thrust
is different.

00:49:32.350 --> 00:49:36.490
So we just need to make sure
that the sailors understand

00:49:36.490 --> 00:49:41.010
that they still try to
create some thrust.

00:49:41.010 --> 00:49:47.040
And it's still like a normal
sail plan, except that the

00:49:47.040 --> 00:49:48.570
tool you're using
is different.

00:49:48.570 --> 00:49:51.810
So the way you create this
force is different.

00:49:51.810 --> 00:49:58.450
So the only thing is to teach
them what are the settings

00:49:58.450 --> 00:50:02.710
that will be OK to recreate
what was happening before.

00:50:02.710 --> 00:50:08.370
And then, so initially, it was a
bit complex for them because

00:50:08.370 --> 00:50:15.690
you rely more on numbers and
data and everything.

00:50:15.690 --> 00:50:21.570
Where, I mean, I remember during
the 2010 campaign where

00:50:21.570 --> 00:50:24.780
we had this one of the quote
that you're going to find in

00:50:24.780 --> 00:50:29.480
the book is normally a sailor
looks at his sail and checks

00:50:29.480 --> 00:50:32.250
how it fly, how it's
in the air.

00:50:32.250 --> 00:50:34.200
And when you go in an aircraft,
the pilot doesn't

00:50:34.200 --> 00:50:35.470
look at his wing.

00:50:35.470 --> 00:50:38.820
So it's just like, I just need
to get used to that.

00:50:38.820 --> 00:50:41.260
But overall, at the end, the
sailor will still use his

00:50:41.260 --> 00:50:44.030
feeling and how the
boat is loaded and

00:50:44.030 --> 00:50:45.310
how the boat reacts.

00:50:45.310 --> 00:50:47.240
So now they are the level where

00:50:47.240 --> 00:50:49.490
they can use it properly.

00:50:49.490 --> 00:51:04.490
