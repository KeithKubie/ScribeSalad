00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.230
&gt;&gt; 
So I actually met Erik about six months ago.

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:14.990
He works with someone that I know pretty well
at EF Tours.

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:20.540
We actually have three things in common.
One is, I sent all my kids to EF Tours to

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:24.310
go abroad, and so I believe very deeply in
the company he's working for.

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:34.660
Second thing is, the biggest chunk of the
Berlin wall (that's in the United States)

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.370
is actually in front of his building, and
it's really cool.

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:44.559
It's a big piece of the wall.
It was raining so I didn't check the graffiti.

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:47.710
Third thing is, he and I played on the basketball
team together at Notre Dame.

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:52.170
I was the starting center; and he, the short
forward, so.

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.320
We have a lot of history together, so.
When I heard about -- Erik came over a couple

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.530
of months ago, and we talked about kind of
social media in general.

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.440
And it was just really interesting that someone
in his position at EF Tours is doing this.

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.000
And I just thought, "Hey, I want to come over
and hear what the book's about."

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.490
So I invited him out, and he took us up on
it.

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.420
And so, it's my pleasure to introduce him.

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.870
Erik Qualman: Well, thanks for having me.

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:17.870
&gt;&gt; [Clapping]

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:22.840
Erik Qualman: I really appreciate, I get to
hear all these fun facts.

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.100
The duck boat tour goes right by our office.
And so, there's always some new tidbit that

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.410
I pick up, either about the Berlin wall or
that 70 percent of the people that work at

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:34.470
our company are female or something that's
true or not true from the duck boat tour -- however

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.000
they're feeling for the day.
Anyways, today I'm just going to talk a little

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.070
bit about the book, which you guys have, and
why I think that social media is one of the

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.640
greatest shifts since the Industrial Revolution.
It's a real honor for me to be at Google.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.850
This is probably the savviest tech audience
I've been in front of.

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:54.180
So it'll be real nice to get into Q and A
to hear what you guys are doing and kind of

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.221
have a two-way learning here.
Want to open up a couple slides here, and

00:01:58.221 --> 00:02:10.960
we'll walk through the presentation.
[pause] All right.

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:13.860
The third reason that I come here today is
that social media is changing behavior.

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.990
Obviously, it changes your online behavior.
But -- what a big thing has changed is your

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:20.980
offline behavior.
And we'll talk a little bit about that today.

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.320
Businesses must adapt to recognize the behavior.
And also, What are successful people and also

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:29.260
companies doing in this phase?
As you saw in the video, it takes liberty

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.720
with James Carville's quote: "It's really
about a people-driven economy stupid."

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:40.290
That it is really dissected down to where
anyone can get on and transfer information

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.590
quickly.
The cost of entry is so low.

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.870
Some of you guys chuckled at this.
This is from Hitwise, but it's really overtaken

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.300
pornography as the top activity on the web.
This is intriguing.

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:57.240
This is '07 vs '09 -- the most visited websites
out there.

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.480
'07 is showing Yahoo.
I think I'd argue that -- this was from comScore

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.560
 -- that this would have been Google, even
in '07.

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:08.530
But here you can see, obviously, it goes from
five that are in the top 20 to nine social

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.650
media sites that are in the top 20.
And three of the top five are now social media

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.890
sites.
And you could even argue that -- like Google

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:19.330
with search wiki that's come up, and also
stuff like on Google maps where you could

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:23.280
actually go in and change some of the direction
stuff -- that there's huge social components

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.209
of Google as well.
Also, on CNN, half their content is now provided

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:30.700
by Twitter it seems, if you ever watched CNN
these days.

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.200
I don't know -- did any of you guys see the
John Daly spoof?

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.370
Not spoof, but one of -- I think, it was Rick
Sanchez was reading Twitter, and he thought

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.500
I was going to say something that supported
Palin.

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.411
And it was something opposite of what he thought
it was.

00:03:42.411 --> 00:03:46.320
And so, Jon Stewart was making fun of him
going, "Rick Sanchez, you need to pull your

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.800
head out of your ass."
You know, while you're reading Twitter, you've

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:53.150
got to read this before you see it.
Craigslist, you could argue, is also social.

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:58.380
So there's a fine line between what's social
and what's the general level.

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:04.480
I could sit here with stats all day, but I
think a picture tells a thousand words.

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.210
This is just showing the popes on all these
activities.

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:12.709
And as it's shown, wiki -- you guys know -- means
a Hawaiian term for 'quick'.

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:15.290
A lot of companies are using wiki's in different
ways.

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:19.410
Facebook, to translate their site into Spanish,
they've just put a wiki up for their users.

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:23.190
And they're able to do it within four weeks.
So their user base is translated.

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.870
So there's companies that are being smart
about it out there and how do they crowd source

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:33.659
stuff effectively.
Social -- does anyone know who this is?

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:39.770
Nice. Ben Roethlisberger is the quarterback
of the champion Pittsburgh Steelers.

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:45.189
So there's two major forms of behavior in
social media: there's preventative and also

00:04:45.189 --> 00:04:48.800
braggadocio.
Preventative is "No, no. That is not me."

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.509
So try not to get fired, and also, trying
to get hired.

00:04:52.509 --> 00:04:54.849
And so, that's really affecting your offline
behavior.

00:04:54.849 --> 00:05:00.279
You almost have to live as if your mother's
watching you, just because of the transparency.

00:05:00.279 --> 00:05:03.919
The second form of behavior is more fun -- is
the braggadocio.

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:07.999
It's "Me, me, me. That was me. That is what
I'm doing."

00:05:07.999 --> 00:05:12.240
What this is having is that, if you're updating
your status and your tweets all the time,

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.919
you have a realtime feedback on your life.
So you're not going to look back ten years

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:18.809
from now and realize, "What did I do with
my life?"

00:05:18.809 --> 00:05:23.440
You're going to see realtime that, "Okay,
I'm putting that I'm watching reruns of Saved

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:26.180
by the Bell.
That's not quite as cool as my friend that

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:31.370
just posted that I'm whitewater rafting."
And so, that's really showing the offline

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:38.550
effect that's being driven by social media.
So there's a lot of companies that are trying

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:41.110
to wrestle with, What are they supposed to
do in the social media space?

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:43.490
How do they leverage it?
They know there's a lot of power out there,

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:48.960
but how do they properly leverage it?
Preventative behavior from businesses is that

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:52.289
some of them can't get a handle on it.
So they decided they're really not going to

00:05:52.289 --> 00:05:56.020
do anything.
And that's really analogous to an ostrich

00:05:56.020 --> 00:06:00.620
sticking their head in the sand and really
not being part of the conversation.

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:04.759
The difference is, big companies -- for them
 -- they've always been in a position of being

00:06:04.759 --> 00:06:06.919
able to say, "Okay, we're going to do this."
Or "We're not going to do this."

00:06:06.919 --> 00:06:10.349
But, with social media, it's going to happen
without them, whether they like it or not.

00:06:10.349 --> 00:06:13.229
So it's more important for them to actually
be part of the conversation.

00:06:13.229 --> 00:06:17.900
It's similar to maybe some of your friends
haven't gotten a Facebook account, because

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:22.569
they don't want to be tagged in the photos
or they don't want to have this stuff that's

00:06:22.569 --> 00:06:25.979
out there about them.
The thing is, those photos are still going

00:06:25.979 --> 00:06:28.119
to be out there.
It's whether you want to be aware of it or

00:06:28.119 --> 00:06:30.830
not.
So it's better to be a part of that conversation

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:35.470
so that, if there is a photo or something
egregiously said about your company, then

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:37.710
you can actually proactively do something
about it.

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:42.889
This is the John Deere example.
Eight months ago, they didn't have a Facebook

00:06:42.889 --> 00:06:46.180
fan page.
And these are all groups and fan pages that

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:51.819
are being formed around their product.
And so, it ranges from, "Country girls who

00:06:51.819 --> 00:06:56.060
ain't afraid to dip a drive with John Deere.
I love John Deere, because nothing runs like

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:58.479
a John Deere."
Then, obviously, this one's doing something

00:06:58.479 --> 00:07:02.879
to a logo that most companies don't prefer
to have done to their logo.

00:07:02.879 --> 00:07:06.430
So, what they've done is, they're now back
in the space.

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:09.780
They've got 88,000 fans.
So, they've entered into the space.

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:13.189
And it's not the sexiest product.
They sell lawn mowers, and also, they sell

00:07:13.189 --> 00:07:18.289
heavy machinery -- more of a B to B company.
That's one of the top questions I get too

00:07:18.289 --> 00:07:22.509
is, "Is it just a B to C play?"
And really, on the B to B side, it's actually

00:07:22.509 --> 00:07:27.069
more important.
Because, in B to B plays, there's usually

00:07:27.069 --> 00:07:29.889
a smaller set of relationships that you need
to maintain.

00:07:29.889 --> 00:07:32.789
So it's important for you to have a stronger
relationship.

00:07:32.789 --> 00:07:37.740
And what it does is, it augments that interpersonal
communication that you have with your company.

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:42.509
The other piece that's easier for B to B is
that, for B to C, they almost have to have

00:07:42.509 --> 00:07:46.449
some of the engagements in a digital format.
They almost have to take their customer service

00:07:46.449 --> 00:07:49.309
in a Twitterlike format, because it's just
the mass scale.

00:07:49.309 --> 00:07:53.999
They can't have that personal relationship.
Whereas B to B, they have that strong relationship.

00:07:53.999 --> 00:07:57.879
It's even easier for them to maintain it and
leverage social media, because they have less

00:07:57.879 --> 00:08:01.999
of a scale.
This other thing is second.

00:08:01.999 --> 00:08:04.939
A lot of companies are afraid, because they
might have negative feedback.

00:08:04.939 --> 00:08:08.939
But, great companies actually accept and love
negative feedback, because they can actually

00:08:08.939 --> 00:08:12.619
fix their product and fix their service.
They can do something about it.

00:08:12.619 --> 00:08:14.669
So the great companies say, "Negative feedback's
good."

00:08:14.669 --> 00:08:18.469
The worst kind of feedback is 'no feedback'
 -- is that your customer just starts to leave,

00:08:18.469 --> 00:08:23.749
and you don't know why they've left you.
This third one is that, if you aggregate all

00:08:23.749 --> 00:08:28.369
of your customers -- especially, let's say,
if you aggregate all your customers in one

00:08:28.369 --> 00:08:30.529
area, that people are afraid that they'll
come in and poach them.

00:08:30.529 --> 00:08:34.070
That they'll be easier to come in and say,
"Oh, these are the customers of said product.

00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:38.899
Let's go in and grab those guys."
That's not a problem with your social media

00:08:38.899 --> 00:08:42.269
strategy.
That's a problem with your product.

00:08:42.269 --> 00:08:46.880
If your clients are that easy to pick off,
then, there's something inherently wrong with

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:56.040
what you're supplying to your customers.
[pause] So this is what's going to be really,

00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:59.260
really interesting for me to talk with you
guys today and see -- I'm sure you guys have

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.310
stuff that you guys are producing that I don't
even know about.

00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:05.660
But where this thing is going -- at least,
the way I see it, and what a lot of the book's

00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:09.420
about is that, in the future really, your
search could still happen on Google.

00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:13.100
So you do your search on Google, but it's
going to pull in different items, whether

00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:17.000
those are coming in from Google's repository,
or really, it's going to be coming in from

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.290
all the other places on the web.
So if you're searching for a hotel, it'll

00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:26.029
pull in information from TripAdvisor that
pulls it in, and also, it says -- instead

00:09:26.029 --> 00:09:30.350
of being opaque, like it is today on TripAdvisor,
it'll actually say, "This person is from your

00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:33.779
social graft.
Here's what they think about said hotel."

00:09:33.779 --> 00:09:37.279
And so, that's where it eliminates some of
the multiple, individual redundancies that

00:09:37.279 --> 00:09:40.790
we have today.
Whether it's involved with, How do I find

00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:46.920
the correct product for my specific need?
And a good example is finding a baby seat.

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:51.230
So if you just had a baby, that's a pretty
important task if your wife says, "Okay, you're

00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:54.230
in charge.
You go buy the child seat for the car."

00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:56.990
That's a pretty important purchase.
You want to make sure you don't screw that

00:09:56.990 --> 00:10:00.120
one up.
And so, we have some great tools today.

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:03.860
Obviously, with Google, that's where they're
going to start and go in and search and try

00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:07.240
to find out, "What is the best product?"
They'll try to find some review sites around

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:10.300
child seats to figure out and vet through
what that is.

00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:13.589
They'll also probably, hopefully, run into
some folks that they know that also have a

00:10:13.589 --> 00:10:18.940
kid and see what kind of seats that they have.
That becomes much simpler in the future from

00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:23.480
a standpoint of, The search still happens
on Google, but now what comes in is that,

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:28.180
"Of your 150 friends that you have on your
social network, 30 of them have purchased

00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:34.870
a seat in the last year or two years.
Of those 30, 20 have purchased this exact

00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:36.890
seat.
And then, here is what the reviews are on

00:10:36.890 --> 00:10:40.731
that seat."
So that helps eliminate a lot of what I call,

00:10:40.731 --> 00:10:45.980
"multiple, individual redundancies."
If there's 20 people that wanted to buy a

00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:51.480
child seat out of your group of friends, and
five have already vetted through that and

00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:55.750
done all the homework and the due diligence
and have actually used the product, then the

00:10:55.750 --> 00:11:01.980
rest of the 15 can kind of have a good comfort
level knowing that, "Okay, these five people

00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:04.269
have done all this stuff.
I don't have to redo all this work.

00:11:04.269 --> 00:11:11.670
So, I can go out and get this seat.
Feel pretty comfortable about purchasing it."

00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:14.930
So this is on Twitter.
How many of you guys are using Twitter? All

00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:19.820
right.
How many of you guys use it for personal reasons?

00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:22.910
All right.
How many use it for business?

00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:30.060
How many use it for both? [pause]
So, this is just getting back to -- this is

00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:34.790
a great customer service tool.
A lot of companies, like a Jet Blue, Comcast,

00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:39.779
Zappos, anybody -- when I sell those -- for
me, when I get on the train tonight, I'm going

00:11:39.779 --> 00:11:45.120
to go on and go to search.twitter.com -- and
they can look and see everything that's being

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:49.440
said about their brand.
And it varies all across the board from this

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:53.500
first one, "Free movies on New York to see
Jet Blue play, because the blank was broken

00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:58.680
and they delayed an hour to fix it."
So, the second thing is, "Jet Blue smoking

00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:01.540
sign's on.
Two Jet Blue flights made emergency landings

00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:04.620
at Kennedy airport."
Those both aren't fairly good.

00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:06.850
This one though, "On Jet Blue right now -- red
eye, in fact.

00:12:06.850 --> 00:12:11.240
The Big Apple. Had a blast in Orlando."
So it varies from positive and negative.

00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:12.699
But it's important for them to stay on top
of it.

00:12:12.699 --> 00:12:16.649
So a lot of companies are just using this
as a customer service tool.

00:12:16.649 --> 00:12:22.420
A little misnomer in the news is that they
think Twitter is this amazing, great thing

00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:25.050
for customer service.
Definitely it helps, but one of the reasons

00:12:25.050 --> 00:12:29.790
the customer service is so good is because
they've taken their best and brightest customer

00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:34.689
service reps and put them on Twitter.
So obviously, if you called in, and they only

00:12:34.689 --> 00:12:38.110
funneled you to their best reps, it's going
to be a little better experience.

00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:41.689
But, it's one of the huge powers of Twitter
is the search functionality to be able to

00:12:41.689 --> 00:12:47.639
get in and see what those conversations are.
For B to B companies, it's huge, because they

00:12:47.639 --> 00:12:51.519
have their clients.
But obviously, their clients have their clients.

00:12:51.519 --> 00:12:55.860
And historically, it was tough for them to
see what the paying points were of that downstream

00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:59.029
client.
But today, they can go on -- if you're in

00:12:59.029 --> 00:13:03.350
Intel, and you're supplying chips to Apple
and the Dells of the world, you can go on

00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:08.019
and see what those paying points are of your
customers by going into the tools, like Twitter,

00:13:08.019 --> 00:13:12.410
that you know ahead of time.
So you can work with Apple and Dell if you're

00:13:12.410 --> 00:13:18.319
Intel and say, "Hey, we know they're having
problems when they're in x, y, and z.

00:13:18.319 --> 00:13:20.440
Here's what our solution is."
So they can see ahead of the time what the

00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:26.600
issues are.
Now, for marketers, how do their jobs change?

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:30.910
When they go into these tools -- major mistakes
that companies do when they get into Twitter

00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:33.879
and Facebook -- they immediately get in there
and do the old-school messaging, which is

00:13:33.879 --> 00:13:38.680
more blasting.
More the 30-second type commercial -- that

00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:40.930
kind of strategy.
And what they do is, they come in, and they're

00:13:40.930 --> 00:13:44.160
basically shouting once they get in there.
So they'll go into Twitter, and they'll say,

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:46.939
"Hey, we've got this new product that just
came out.

00:13:46.939 --> 00:13:49.720
We've got 30 percent off."
And you'll see all their streams right away.

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:53.070
It's just all about them.
And that's the worst thing you can do.

00:13:53.070 --> 00:13:58.440
The best thing you can do is -- there's Dale
Carnegie and David Ogilvy, two of the best

00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:02.949
marketeers of the last century.
Both took a little different tactics.

00:14:02.949 --> 00:14:07.149
Dale Carnegie is the one that wrote "How to
Win Friends and Influence People."

00:14:07.149 --> 00:14:10.720
And David Ogilvy was more the messenger: Great
30-second commercials.

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:16.370
Great marketeer. Both super-successful.
But in the here and now, the more successful

00:14:16.370 --> 00:14:19.079
folks are going to act more like Dale Carnegie.
They're going to listen first.

00:14:19.079 --> 00:14:22.579
They're going to know what the conversation
 -- How is it transpiring?

00:14:22.579 --> 00:14:26.230
What's going on? What are the needs? -- before
they sell.

00:14:26.230 --> 00:14:32.660
So it's "Listen first, sell second."
And the beauty of all this is that, Products

00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:36.680
that deliver the best value will win.
Well, historically, you think that's always

00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:40.870
the case, but it's not.
Because, historically, the bigger companies

00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:44.769
controlled the distribution systems and the
marketing mechanisms.

00:14:44.769 --> 00:14:47.870
So they can make up for bad product by having
control over this piece.

00:14:47.870 --> 00:14:51.540
But all of a sudden, this piece goes away,
because the information is everywhere.

00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:56.900
And the transparency is realtime and it's
fast and they can figure out.

00:14:56.900 --> 00:15:00.600
In the video, you see how the 'word of mouth'
now becomes 'world of mouth', because it just

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:03.769
happens so quick.
And in the end, that means the customer wins.

00:15:03.769 --> 00:15:11.689
And in the end, the great companies win. [pause]
So this is an interesting example of just

00:15:11.689 --> 00:15:14.870
different tactics on how companies go about
using social media.

00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:17.579
So this is about, I guess, a year and a half
ago now.

00:15:17.579 --> 00:15:23.520
Is that, applications came out on Facebook.
And so, there's a company that thought, "Wow,

00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:28.199
it'd be great idea -- all those people just
put pins on their wall, of their map, showing

00:15:28.199 --> 00:15:29.749
how cool they are of where they've traveled
to.

00:15:29.749 --> 00:15:35.709
Why don't we make that more of a digital version?"
And so, the first company set off and started

00:15:35.709 --> 00:15:37.689
off.
They had a head start, because they knew someone

00:15:37.689 --> 00:15:39.819
at Facebook.
And they launched it.

00:15:39.819 --> 00:15:44.069
And they got 50,000 users today.
So they think that things are going great.

00:15:44.069 --> 00:15:48.959
They get an e-mail from Craig Ulliott, who
says he's a 23-year-old kid that says, "Hey,

00:15:48.959 --> 00:15:53.190
have you thought about not making it mandatory
for us to give our e-mail address?

00:15:53.190 --> 00:15:59.240
I think we should just get this tool for free.
And also, could you make it a little flashier

00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:02.470
and better?"
And the company goes, "Well, we're getting

00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:06.030
50,000 downloads a day."
You know, "It's working.

00:16:06.030 --> 00:16:10.160
Why fix something that's broken?"
So Craig sets off, and he decides to write

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:13.389
his own thing.
So he sets off, and not only writes his own

00:16:13.389 --> 00:16:17.420
thing, he starts a whole company called "Where
I've Been".

00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:21.120
So he launches Where I've Been.
That thing all of a sudden shoots through

00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:26.720
the roof.
Gets 600-, 700,000 monthly subscribers.

00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:29.710
And it's one of the better successes of the
applications.

00:16:29.710 --> 00:16:33.680
At the same time, there's companies like Travels
You and TripAdvisor -- they're trying to figure

00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:38.089
out, "Okay, this thing's huge.
Do we write it ourselves, or do we reach out

00:16:38.089 --> 00:16:41.740
to Craig and try to purchase it from Craig?"
So they try to reach out to Craig.

00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:44.380
And they think he's like this kid that's in
his garage.

00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:48.350
But it turns out, he's got a partner that
worked at Priceline for several years.

00:16:48.350 --> 00:16:53.050
So anyways, TripAdvisor comes close to purchasing
this for $3 million.

00:16:53.050 --> 00:16:57.160
Actually, press release goes out -- not from
them -- but a report goes out that they did

00:16:57.160 --> 00:17:03.399
purchase it for $3 million, but they didn't.
What they decided to do is, the CEO at TripAdvisor

00:17:03.399 --> 00:17:06.540
is very sharp.
He goes down to his team and goes, "How long

00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:09.069
is it going to take us to build something
similar to this?"

00:17:09.069 --> 00:17:12.110
And the team says, "It'll probably take about
40 days."

00:17:12.110 --> 00:17:16.390
And Steve Kaufer, the CEO of TripAdvisor's
got a sign outside his door that says, "Speed

00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:18.391
Wins."
And he goes, "Can we do it in four days?"

00:17:18.391 --> 00:17:23.670
[laughter]
And they say, "Sure."

00:17:23.670 --> 00:17:27.280
So, but I'm sure it was like, "Sure, we could
do that.

00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:29.141
We'll be working all night for the next four
days."

00:17:29.141 --> 00:17:34.030
But they spent a weekend and obviously, two
more days, working around the clock, to get

00:17:34.030 --> 00:17:37.361
this thing out there.
They utilized Google maps, because they go,

00:17:37.361 --> 00:17:39.860
"Why wouldn't we use this?
This is what people were used to using.

00:17:39.860 --> 00:17:42.890
It's the best tool out there."
So then, they just decide to go and do their

00:17:42.890 --> 00:17:47.350
own thing and launch this.
And now, they have hosted -- it varies -- but

00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:52.150
it's usually around 3 million monthly users
that use this tool.

00:17:52.150 --> 00:17:55.790
And "Where I've Been" still has a fair amount.
They still have about 400-, 600,000 monthly

00:17:55.790 --> 00:18:00.170
users.
The original company doesn't really have any

00:18:00.170 --> 00:18:04.260
active users, because the original company
was using old constructs.

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:07.280
They thought they had to get that person into
their database.

00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:10.290
That's how they've always marketed.
"They need to be in my database.

00:18:10.290 --> 00:18:13.440
My boss is only going to reward me if I add
people to my database."

00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:15.710
But it's a whole new world.
It doesn't matter.

00:18:15.710 --> 00:18:18.470
As long as you message to them, it doesn't
matter if it's coming from your database,

00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:22.669
or whether you're utilizing a platform like,
Facebook. You're still [inaudible]

00:18:22.669 --> 00:18:26.900
The other thing is, the second piece is really
"Beg, borrow, and make better."

00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:31.620
You don't have to have the original thought
and the 'first to market' to have this stuff

00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:33.350
work.
It's really just looking out there to see

00:18:33.350 --> 00:18:35.700
what's out there.
See if it's meeting everyone's need, and,

00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:38.880
if it's not, then adjust it accordingly and
make it better.

00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:43.320
And then, three -- as I said -- speed wins.
The difference in speed here is, it doesn't

00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:45.920
have to be 'first to market'.
Just when you decide to do something, you

00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:50.500
need to get it out there and put it in beta.
And I'm kind of -- can take this back, because

00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:53.270
you guys understand all this stuff.
A lot of the audiences that I speak to, do

00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:55.851
not.
But it's just getting this stuff out there.

00:18:55.851 --> 00:19:00.200
Because you're going to get out, fail, then
fail better, and then win.

00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:04.280
Because, in social media, the first time you're
going to launch this stuff, usually it's not

00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:08.150
going to be that successful, so you're going
to have to adjust it after you get it out

00:19:08.150 --> 00:19:11.430
there.
Then the fourth piece is just, you can have

00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:16.030
multiple winners in this.
"Where I've Been" still has 400,000/600,000

00:19:16.030 --> 00:19:19.690
users.
So it doesn't have to be 'the original', only

00:19:19.690 --> 00:19:26.070
idea out there.
This is another interesting example of what

00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:31.560
companies are doing.
ESPN. How many people are big ESPN fans? All

00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:35.000
right.
So they have historically covered the NFL.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:40.300
They have a couple of reporters like John
Clayton and Ed Werder to go out and couple

00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:44.180
more that they travel around the country,
and they try to become experts on the team.

00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:47.551
But what they found out -- through a lot of
their podcasts and also online -- is that,

00:19:47.551 --> 00:19:51.880
there's actually a better model out there.
And so, they've started to solicit bloggers

00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:55.320
that are local to each team and also just
superfans.

00:19:55.320 --> 00:20:00.090
And what happens is that these folks have
grown up with this team.

00:20:00.090 --> 00:20:05.610
They know everything about this team.
It also saves ESPN a ton of money, because

00:20:05.610 --> 00:20:10.050
they're not flying people all around the country.
The listener enjoys it more, because these

00:20:10.050 --> 00:20:14.540
are real experts, and it's not someone that's
trying to learn up on this stuff and know

00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:18.950
what all 15 teams are doing.
And so, I call it the "Tom Sawyer approach".

00:20:18.950 --> 00:20:21.570
They're really convincing these folks to work
for them for free.

00:20:21.570 --> 00:20:24.250
They're painting the fence for free, and they're
loving it.

00:20:24.250 --> 00:20:29.990
They're an ESPN blogger; they're an ESPN superfan.
The huge difference is that, with technology

00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:34.940
enabling it, that your customer today can
be your competition tomorrow.

00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:41.370
If I'm listening to a fantasy podcast, and
these guys cover both baseball and football,

00:20:41.370 --> 00:20:43.990
and they're not really up to speed on all
the players.

00:20:43.990 --> 00:20:47.060
They're asking, "Oh, what's that guy's name?"
And the listener is sitting there going, "This

00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:48.390
is crazy.
I know more about this.

00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:53.650
I live, eat, and breathe fantasy football."
So, the next day, they might start their own

00:20:53.650 --> 00:20:58.140
podcast.
And so, it's another proactive way of ESPN

00:20:58.140 --> 00:21:01.490
 -- the old cliche is, you know, "If you can't
beat them, join them."

00:21:01.490 --> 00:21:04.010
Well, they're joining them before they can
beat them.

00:21:04.010 --> 00:21:06.080
So they're realizing, these people could be
their competitors.

00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:13.010
Let's reach out to these bloggers.
Make them part of our team before they become

00:21:13.010 --> 00:21:18.360
our competitors.
So this is from Tech Crunch.

00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:22.780
This is from a big, music executive.
They didn't list his name -- him or her name

00:21:22.780 --> 00:21:26.410
out -- but it's all part of a masterplan.
The spreadsheets and financial models dictate

00:21:26.410 --> 00:21:29.950
the swing customers and partners.
This makes too much sense.

00:21:29.950 --> 00:21:35.110
So the reason I put this in there is, a lot
of companies -- they have fear of this technology

00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:39.530
 -- false evidence appearing real.
Because, if you're a music industry person,

00:21:39.530 --> 00:21:43.470
you should have just embraced that change.
You no longer have those distribution costs

00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:45.810
that you once did.
You no longer have these production costs.

00:21:45.810 --> 00:21:49.870
It's actually a lot higher margin.
Instead of suing your customer base, you should

00:21:49.870 --> 00:21:52.280
have embraced this technology and changed
from the getgo.

00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:55.510
If they thought about it -- it's similar to
when they used to hand out records to deejays

00:21:55.510 --> 00:21:58.750
in the 50's to get the word out.
They give that stuff away for free.

00:21:58.750 --> 00:22:01.160
And obviously, there's a lot of case studies
like Radio Head.

00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:04.450
They gave out their stuff for free, and they
actually had record sales.

00:22:04.450 --> 00:22:08.600
Monty Python launched their stuff on YouTube.
They were having issues where everyone was

00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:11.440
posting their stuff on YouTube, and they fought
it for several years.

00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:13.460
And they said, "Screw this. Let's reverse
it.

00:22:13.460 --> 00:22:19.170
We'll just go in and do our own channel."
So that they had record sales selling DVD

00:22:19.170 --> 00:22:26.000
once they made that change on YouTube.
But this still continues to occur today from

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:30.350
a standpoint of, You're seeing it play out
a lot, and you'll see it play out more in

00:22:30.350 --> 00:22:34.341
the cable industry.
Because, obviously, the Comcasts of the world

00:22:34.341 --> 00:22:37.150
 -- they control your Internet pipe and also
your TV pipe.

00:22:37.150 --> 00:22:42.370
But a lot of folks are going out there, just
like I don't have -- I don't pay $150 for

00:22:42.370 --> 00:22:44.980
cable.
I watch everything online.

00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:50.450
Stream it through the Mac, through my TV.
Just like when people gave up their landline

00:22:50.450 --> 00:22:53.781
telephones and just went to wireless.
You're seeing that more and more.

00:22:53.781 --> 00:22:57.890
And Comcast is struggling with it, because
they don't -- they're losing money.

00:22:57.890 --> 00:23:01.160
So they're trying to figure out ways.
Do they charge by bandwidth usage?

00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:04.860
And the difference here -- the way that's
going to play out is going to be intriguing,

00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:10.170
because they control a lot of the pipe, right?
So hopefully, WiMAX comes into play, but you're

00:23:10.170 --> 00:23:13.570
going to see that kind of wrestle with itself
the next couple years.

00:23:13.570 --> 00:23:17.010
The other industry that's really wrestling
with it as well is the publishing industry.

00:23:17.010 --> 00:23:21.340
Now they have these feed readers.
You saw that stat up there that 35 percent

00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:26.000
of sales go to the Kindle.
Where that stat breaks down is, if you're

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:30.780
selling on Amazon a hardcover book in a Kindle
version, that the Kindle will get 35 percent

00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:34.340
of the sales.
And actually, Dan Brown's new book -- I can't

00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:38.440
remember the name of it -- but there's actually
more sales for the Kindle right now for that

00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:43.590
book on Amazon.
Not total, but just when you compare it on

00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:47.230
Amazon.
But again, for them, they have an opportunity

00:23:47.230 --> 00:23:51.510
 -- the publishing industry has a huge opportunity
if they embrace the change, because books

00:23:51.510 --> 00:23:54.640
are inherently social.
You pass on a lot of your paperbacks when

00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:56.770
you're done reading them.
You go, "This is a good book. Here, pass it

00:23:56.770 --> 00:23:59.440
on."
They've never gotten any revenue off that.

00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:02.930
With the Kindle, they've got to figure out
what that revenue stream is for that pass-along.

00:24:02.930 --> 00:24:08.090
Is it 99 cents?
You know, what is that pass-along stream?

00:24:08.090 --> 00:24:11.510
Also, there's a ton more data at their disposal.
Think about libraries.

00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:14.440
They don't know how many times the books run
in the library.

00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:17.750
But now, they'll be able to tell, if there's
a license agreement for these feed readers.

00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:25.180
So each library, do they have five licenses
that go out or is it infinite? [pause]

00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:31.850
This is another just -- juxtaposition on two
different treatments on getting into the cable

00:24:31.850 --> 00:24:35.580
thing I just discussed.
There's NBC vs. ABC.

00:24:35.580 --> 00:24:42.290
NBC -- during the Olympics -- they streamed
a lot of stuff from Beijing live, but they

00:24:42.290 --> 00:24:44.030
didn't stream the stuff that we wanted to
see.

00:24:44.030 --> 00:24:49.520
They didn't stream Michael Phelps live.
They were streaming ping-pong live. [laughter]

00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:52.890
Are you the rating champion here?

00:24:52.890 --> 00:24:54.640
&gt;&gt; [inaudible]

00:24:54.640 --> 00:25:03.300
Erik Qualman: Yeah. [laughter]
But at the end of the day, it's eyeballs or

00:25:03.300 --> 00:25:07.050
eyeballs.
If there's an advertiser that's paying to

00:25:07.050 --> 00:25:11.170
sponsor the Olympics, isn't it inherently
better to show that to as many people as possible?

00:25:11.170 --> 00:25:15.960
There's people at work that don't have their
TV at work, but they can watch it online.

00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:20.130
The problem is -- they wrestle with is that
some of the metrics haven't caught up.

00:25:20.130 --> 00:25:25.370
They can't show to that advertiser that, "Hey,
you know, we've got these Nielsen ratings

00:25:25.370 --> 00:25:27.551
that are offline ratings.
We haven't really been able to figure out

00:25:27.551 --> 00:25:31.690
the Nielsen online ratings to compile them
together to give it to you and show you that

00:25:31.690 --> 00:25:34.240
you paid x, y, z, but we gave you this many
more eyeballs."

00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:39.430
And so, what they do is, they let the metrics
kind of lead them instead of best business

00:25:39.430 --> 00:25:44.270
practices, which would be, "Of course, we'll
show the Olympics to as many people as possible,

00:25:44.270 --> 00:25:46.490
and they'll show the ad to as many people
as possible.

00:25:46.490 --> 00:25:50.750
So that, in the end, more people buy our sponsor's
products."

00:25:50.750 --> 00:25:54.260
So the PGA realized that, "Hey, that's probably
a good idea."

00:25:54.260 --> 00:25:58.540
So what they did this year and also last year
 -- so Tiger was in the final hunt both this

00:25:58.540 --> 00:26:02.530
year and last year.
Last year, he won in a playoff match against

00:26:02.530 --> 00:26:07.160
Rocco Mediate on a Monday.
So, it was a Monday, and they decided to let

00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:10.320
it go online.
And it shut down many companies' servers,

00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:13.390
as people were watching this tournament play
out.

00:26:13.390 --> 00:26:18.450
Then this year, they took it one step further.
And they go, "Let's really embrace this stuff."

00:26:18.450 --> 00:26:22.200
And so, again, it came down to Tiger against
Yang, from South Korea.

00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:27.050
And what they did was enabled on their site
 -- on the PGA.com -- they enabled it so that

00:26:27.050 --> 00:26:31.221
MySpace, Facebook, and Twitter -- you could
see these feeds coming realtime.

00:26:31.221 --> 00:26:35.010
So you have Facebook; there's MySpace, and
there's Twitter, all in one area.

00:26:35.010 --> 00:26:37.920
And obviously, this stuff is blasting out
on those properties as well.

00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:42.920
So a lot of people that were on Facebook or
on Twitter could see, "Oh, my gosh.

00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:47.940
I totally forgot that this is going on.
It looks like Yang and Tiger on the 14th hole.

00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:52.870
I'm going to watch the last four holes of
the tournament and get on there and check

00:26:52.870 --> 00:26:55.870
it out."
The other thing they did is, they had an iPhone

00:26:55.870 --> 00:26:58.110
app.
So you could watch this live also on your

00:26:58.110 --> 00:26:59.920
iPhone.
So they really, fully, embraced it.

00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:04.450
So it's just a different -- you could see
the different tacks that people are taking.

00:27:04.450 --> 00:27:08.920
And I'll leave it to you guys to decide who
you think is taking the better approach.

00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:13.080
I mean, I would argue strongly that it's ABC
with what they're doing, because it's all

00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:16.440
about the user.
And you guys embrace that every day.

00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:20.390
It's all about, What are the users?

00:27:20.390 --> 00:27:21.480
&gt;&gt; [inaudible]

00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:28.650
Erik Qualman: Right. Yep. Yeah, exactly.
That's a good point too is that, in the future,

00:27:28.650 --> 00:27:32.840
everything's going to be served through an
IP, just because of the tracking capability.

00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:35.430
So it's funny, I think we're going to look
back in just a couple of years and laugh and

00:27:35.430 --> 00:27:40.380
say, "I can't believe they're so resistant
to serving this stuff over an IP."

00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:43.570
This is just a quick example of, All the companies
make mistakes.

00:27:43.570 --> 00:27:48.970
And so, Apple -- who some people think never
make mistakes -- this actually ties in with

00:27:48.970 --> 00:27:50.770
you guys.
Because what they did was, there was an app

00:27:50.770 --> 00:27:53.580
that was written -- and a lot of you guys
are probably familiar with this -- but they

00:27:53.580 --> 00:27:57.320
wrote an application that was pulling into
the Gutenberg project, that you guys were

00:27:57.320 --> 00:28:03.110
very helpful into putting books for free online.
And so, this application did that.

00:28:03.110 --> 00:28:07.200
But, one of the books was the kamasutra.
And so, Apple decided, "Woa, we need to shut

00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:13.340
the whole application down."
And after about three hours of just getting

00:28:13.340 --> 00:28:18.890
pummeled with every comment you can imagine,
they reversed their decision.

00:28:18.890 --> 00:28:23.071
So, it just shows that if you're a company
 -- if you make a mistake, just own up to

00:28:23.071 --> 00:28:28.070
it and adjust it accordingly.
And for the guy that wrote that app -- I forgot

00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:34.990
his name -- but, they say that it's the best
thing to happen to your app is get banned

00:28:34.990 --> 00:28:39.380
by Apple. [laughter]
So then, this is just sums up a lot of what

00:28:39.380 --> 00:28:43.000
the book's about.
It's, "Act more like Dale Carnegie and less

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.960
like Dave Ogilvy.
Listen first, sell second."

00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:47.900
What I didn't talk a lot about is this: One
essence.

00:28:47.900 --> 00:28:52.330
Be true to that essence.
It eliminates what I call 'social schizophrenia',

00:28:52.330 --> 00:28:56.090
is that -- historically, you've been able
to kind of have your two personas if you wanted

00:28:56.090 --> 00:28:57.880
to.
If you were an accountant during the week

00:28:57.880 --> 00:29:01.790
 -- if you're "Al, the accountant," and you've
got everything down to the T during the week.

00:29:01.790 --> 00:29:03.680
Well on the weekend, you can be "Avalanche
Al".

00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:08.330
You can go out and party your brains out.
But the problem is, with the transparency

00:29:08.330 --> 00:29:13.740
and the tiny phones and everything being distributed
with the Ben Roethlisberger photo that I showed.

00:29:13.740 --> 00:29:17.600
That unfortunately -- good or bad or indifferent
 -- that's really not the case anymore.

00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:21.270
The world has changed.
And you have to adjust your behavior accordingly.

00:29:21.270 --> 00:29:25.510
A lot of CEOs ask, "Should I get on a Facebook
account?" Or "Can I have two accounts?"

00:29:25.510 --> 00:29:30.760
I always recommend, "95 percent of the time,
it's a terrible idea to have more than one

00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:33.070
account."
You're going to have to be who you are, and

00:29:33.070 --> 00:29:35.290
that's it.
I mean, and if you don't want to get on it

00:29:35.290 --> 00:29:40.110
 -- that's not what you enjoy doing -- if
you don't enjoy going to a cocktail party

00:29:40.110 --> 00:29:43.670
and networking with everybody, then I'm not
going to send you that cocktail party and

00:29:43.670 --> 00:29:45.780
do that.
So make sure that you really are comfortable

00:29:45.780 --> 00:29:47.400
with doing this stuff before you get into
it.

00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:50.260
And then, just be yourself once you're on
it.

00:29:50.260 --> 00:29:54.850
Products and services.
We find that 70 to 80 percent trust pure recommendations.

00:29:54.850 --> 00:29:58.021
Social media will help eliminate the multiple,
individual redundancy.

00:29:58.021 --> 00:30:02.600
That should be good for society -- less waste
 -- of people that will find exactly what

00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:07.120
they need realtime, quickly.
And then, for marketeers, What does this mean?

00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:11.730
You're going to be less of an advertiser.
You're less writing these great, award-winning

00:30:11.730 --> 00:30:15.500
commercials.
And more about providing content that folks

00:30:15.500 --> 00:30:20.800
need and desire.
If you go back to the opening video, is that,

00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:25.890
what I did -- a tool -- it's ironic.
I have to use social media tools to sell the

00:30:25.890 --> 00:30:28.010
book.
And so, before launching that video -- it's

00:30:28.010 --> 00:30:30.630
really hard to get things viral, as you guys
know.

00:30:30.630 --> 00:30:33.670
But I was listening to the space of what the
main need was.

00:30:33.670 --> 00:30:37.960
And the main need was, "I can't convince my
boss that social media is a big thing.

00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:40.560
Can anyone help?"
And so, that's why I try to put a little stats

00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:43.700
there and put it together and get it out there
and launch it.

00:30:43.700 --> 00:30:46.900
So that's what being a content provider is
all about.

00:30:46.900 --> 00:30:50.720
Party planners more -- if you think about
mash role -- they have these tweet ups.

00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:55.490
And so, they'll host these tweet ups where
they'll take in all these folks that have

00:30:55.490 --> 00:31:01.090
met on Twitter and just having a face-to-face
conversation at certain hotels around the

00:31:01.090 --> 00:31:03.620
country.
So that's another thing is just being able

00:31:03.620 --> 00:31:05.860
to aggregate people.
A lot of people put on conferences now.

00:31:05.860 --> 00:31:10.790
So that's the way that the world changes.
One thing that I'd argue that I think might

00:31:10.790 --> 00:31:16.190
happen is that, it's going to be so important
for people to review your product or service.

00:31:16.190 --> 00:31:22.210
Is that the money then flows from over here
 -- which is mainly brand-awareness -- to,

00:31:22.210 --> 00:31:25.600
"Okay, this person bought my product."
And this is a new concept.

00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:29.520
You've already gotten those surveys when you
go to a hotel.

00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:33.050
It's like, "Hey, you might be able to win
25 bucks or a trip around the world if you

00:31:33.050 --> 00:31:35.700
fill out this survey."
It's taking that money that's over here on

00:31:35.700 --> 00:31:40.400
branding and really saying, "Good, better,
indifferent, if you fill out a review on our

00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:45.720
product, you'll get x, y, and z."
And so, the real debate on that -- that's

00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:49.650
going to happen -- the real debate on that
though is, Does it influence what that review

00:31:49.650 --> 00:31:54.390
is?
Hopefully not. Hopefully, it's just a pure

00:31:54.390 --> 00:31:56.660
review.
Talked a little bit about B to B.

00:31:56.660 --> 00:31:59.550
It's just as important, if not more important,
than for B to C.

00:31:59.550 --> 00:32:03.900
And then, marketing mistakes.
Making a mistake in social media is better

00:32:03.900 --> 00:32:08.980
than not doing anything at all.
Because, at least, you're learning something.

00:32:08.980 --> 00:32:12.460
And then, this last one: It's more outside-in
than inward-out thinking.

00:32:12.460 --> 00:32:15.890
Historically, companies have always gotten
in their meeting rooms, figured out, What

00:32:15.890 --> 00:32:20.570
do we think is best for the marketplace?
And take several months.

00:32:20.570 --> 00:32:24.510
And then they go out with it.
But now, it's really, What is that user doing

00:32:24.510 --> 00:32:26.550
out there?
A lot of these companies -- when they jump

00:32:26.550 --> 00:32:30.840
into social media space -- there's already
groups developed like John Deere so they can

00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:35.080
see what's the main consensus on their need.
So when they go in the space, they can meet

00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:41.850
that need a lot better.
That's it. I'd like to thank you guys.

00:32:41.850 --> 00:32:44.070
And open it up for Q and A and dialog.
