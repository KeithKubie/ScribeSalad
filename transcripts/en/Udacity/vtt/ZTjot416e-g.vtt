Hi Michael!

00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:02.480
&gt;&gt; Hey Charles! How's it going?

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:04.510
&gt;&gt; It's going pretty well. How's it going with you?

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:07.950
&gt;&gt; It is a beautiful fall day here in Providence Rhode Island.

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.140
&gt;&gt; Oh that's right it's fall, when you are.

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:12.750
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, I think, that's right.

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.490
&gt;&gt; So, what we're going to do today, Michael.

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:18.070
If you will indulge me. Is ,we're going to

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:21.050
talk about a different class of ,uh, learning

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:23.110
algorithms and approaches than we've been talking about before.

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:25.360
&gt;&gt; So now the other ones were low class, this is going to

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:26.000
be high class?

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.710
&gt;&gt; Exactly. And we call them instance based learning. Which

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:32.520
sounds very hoity toity and high voluting. Don't you agree?

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:33.490
&gt;&gt; Yeah, sure, why not?

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:33.632
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

00:00:33.632 --> 00:00:35.630
&gt;&gt; It sounds like it maybe has good posture.

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:37.400
&gt;&gt; It does, in fact, have good posture.

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.240
&gt;&gt; Well let's, let's learn about it. I'm, I'm, I'm intrigued.

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.200
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so I think that ,uh, what we're going to

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.090
end up talking about to day is kind of interesting, I

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.520
hope. But it's sort of different, and what I'm hoping is

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.430
through this discussion Is that, we will be able to reveal

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.670
some of the unspoken assumptions that we've been making so far, okay?

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.780
&gt;&gt; Unspoken assumptions, it sounds, yeah, okay, that sounds

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.330
like we should get to the bottom of that.

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:02.410
&gt;&gt; Yes, so let's do that. So, just to remind you of what we have

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.770
been doing in the ,um, past, this is what was going on with all of

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:08.250
our little supervised learning tasks, right. We

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.070
were given a bunch of training data ,labeled

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:15.610
here as you know, x, y One, xy two, xy three, dot, dot, dot, xy zen.

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.150
And ,uh, we would then learn some function.

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:21.130
So, for example, if we have a bunch of

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:22.520
points in a plane, we might learn a

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.970
line to represent them, which is what this little

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.830
blue line is. And what was happening here is we take all this data. We come up

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.180
with some function that represents the data. And

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.820
then we would throw the data away effectively, right?

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.770
&gt;&gt; Okay. Yeah, so like, black is the input here and then

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.980
the two blue things are what get derived by the learning algorithm.

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:40.630
&gt;&gt; Right. And then in

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.740
the future when we get some data point, let's

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.550
call it x, we would pass it through this function

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:47.410
whatever it is. In this case, probably line. And

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:50.940
that would, be how we would determine answers going forward.

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:52.870
&gt;&gt; Yeah. That's, that's what we've been talking about.

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:54.400
&gt;&gt; Right. And in particular without reference

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.600
to the original data. So. I want

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:02.050
to propose an alternative and the alternative is basically going to not do this.

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.354
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

00:02:02.354 --> 00:02:04.889
&gt;&gt; So let me give you a, let me, let me tell u exactly what I mean by that.
