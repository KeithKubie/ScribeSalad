00:00:10.929 --> 00:00:14.849
During the first five years of Prohibition
in New York, there was one name that struck

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.930
fear in the hearts of every bootlegger- Isadore
“Izzy” Einstein.

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.660
A man who a 1922 edition of The Literary Digest
noted was the “master hooch-hound, alongside

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.610
whom all the rest of the pack are but pups.”

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:33.980
This hooch-hound was a Prohibition agent with
a 95% conviction rate and over 4000 arrests,

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:40.480
a record made all the more impressive when
you realise Einstein was a 5 feet 5 inch tall

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:46.140
225 pound Austro-Hungarian immigrant with
no previous background in law enforcement.

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.660
Born in 1880 somewhere in Austria before immigrating
to the states in 1902 seeking a better life,

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.100
Izzy worked as a clerk in the postal office
to support his wife, five children and ageing

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.100
father.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.880
When Prohibition came into effect in January
of 1920, the then 40 years old Izzy was amongst

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:06.640
the first to apply for a job at the Southern
New York Federal Prohibition Bureau.

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.570
As he said, it seemed “a good chance for
a fellow with ambition”.

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:15.250
The pay was $40 per week (about $536 per week
today).

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.970
Initially the Bureau was reluctant to hire
the Rubenesque postal worker, but Izzy was

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.250
persistent, telling his interviewer, Chief
Agent James Shelvin, that he was the perfect

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.420
candidate specifically because he didn’t
look like a Prohibition Agent.

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.310
Izzy also added that he knew “something
about people- their ways and habits- how to

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.479
mix with them and gain their confidence.”

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:38.040
It also helped that he could speak about half
a dozen languages including speaking Yiddish,

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.490
German, Polish, and Hungarian fluently, and
able to get by speaking Russian, Spanish,

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:44.590
Italian and French.

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.920
Shelvin was evidently swayed by Izzy’s argument
and put him to work, testing the theory that

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:54.250
nobody would suspect Izzy of being a Prohibition
officer by sending him to bust a Manhattan

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.530
speakeasy notorious for being able to spot
undercover agents a mile away.

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.520
So, rather than go undercover, Izzy simply
casually strolled into the establishment in

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.060
full agent uniform wearing his badge and asked
the bartender “Would you like to sell a

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.140
pint of whiskey to a deserving Prohibition
agent?”

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.200
The bartender, assuming it was a joke, poured
Izzy a drink before asking where he got such

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.100
a realistic looking badge.

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.519
According to contemporary newspaper accounts,
Izzy calmly responded, “I’ll take you

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:22.019
to the place it came from” and arrested
him.

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:25.829
Over his first few weeks on the beat, Izzy
made several dozen arrests before approaching

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:30.049
his superiors asking if they’d consider
giving his friend, Moe Smith, a job.

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:34.860
Like Izzy, Moe had no background in law enforcement
and was similarly built, standing a few inches

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.359
taller but around 50 pounds heavier.

00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:42.219
When his superiors asked what possible qualifications
an obese cigar store salesmen could have that

00:02:42.219 --> 00:02:46.069
would help him catch bootleggers, Izzy explained,
“He doesn’t look like an agent either”.

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:47.879
He got the job.

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:52.309
Over the next five years, Izzy and Moe, who
the press nicknamed “Tweedledum” and “Tweedledee”,

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:59.049
made over 4000 arrests with a reported conviction
rate of around 95%, seizing in excess of five

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:20.620
million bottles 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:55.010
of liquor.

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:58.650
The pair were so effective that speakeasy
owners would sometimes refuse to serve anyone

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:02.529
drinks if they heard either of the duo were
in the area and both of their pictures were

00:04:02.529 --> 00:04:05.420
widely shared around drinking holes across
New York.

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:08.869
Even people the bartenders thought they knew
weren’t safe to serve to as the duo would

00:04:08.869 --> 00:04:12.840
sometimes get to know the bartenders first
over time to build up trust before asking

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:13.840
for a drink.

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.769
Beyond this, the pair were notorious for disguising
their appearance in ever more elaborate and

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:21.330
hilarious ways, making recognising them next
to impossible.

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:25.260
As one contemporary reporter stated, “A
day with Izzy would make a chameleon blush

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:26.940
for lack of variations.”

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:31.509
izzy-and-moeExamples of some of the more ridiculous
personas adopted by the pair include: Texas

00:04:31.509 --> 00:04:36.300
ranchers, opera singers, travelling violinists,
an elderly Yiddish couple (pictured right),

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:40.930
beauty contest judges, pro football players
(complete with uniform and helmet) and Chinese

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:41.930
launderers.

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:45.990
The Jewish pair even once managed to bust
a speakeasy in Harlem by convincingly posing

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:48.940
as black men over the course of several days.

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:52.960
Another bizarre example included the time
Moe and a near freezing, violently shivering

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:57.439
Izzy walked into a Coney Island speakeasy
wearing a sopping wet bathing suit in the

00:04:57.439 --> 00:05:02.319
middle of winter and exclaimed that he desperately
needed a drink or he’d freeze to death.

00:05:02.319 --> 00:05:08.039
(Aside: Contrary to popular belief, drinking
alcohol helps cool your body, not warm it,

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:10.169
making freezing to death more likely.)

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:13.639
In any event, the ruse worked and Izzy and
Moe got their arrest.

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:17.440
Izzy-disguiseWhat made the pair so effective
was not just their disguises, but how thoroughly

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:18.909
they played the parts.

00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:22.240
For instance, as noted in the April 15, 1922
edition of The Literary Digest,

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:26.590
And just to show his range, Izzy one evening
walked into the Yorkville Casino with a trombone

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:27.760
under his arm.

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:31.800
The false-front shirt, Ascot tie and other
infallible markings of the orchestra musician

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:32.800
were upon him.

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.650
He could play the trombone, too, just as on
a similar occasion in Brooklyn he utilized

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:39.310
a violin to win over the restaurant management.

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:43.319
A good fellow, in each instance the charm
of his music brought proffers of drinks, which

00:05:43.319 --> 00:05:47.229
he accepted, and then displayed his gratitude
by distributing summonses.

00:05:47.229 --> 00:05:49.990
Another day found him pushing a fruit-cart
in the Bronx.

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:51.240
His equipment was real.

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:52.669
There was nothing stagy about it.

00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:56.979
The soft felt hat, the bandanna, the corduroy
trousers, all blended with the rickety two-wheeled

00:05:56.979 --> 00:06:01.520
vehicle to convince the two score saloon keepers
upon whom he called in one day that he was

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:03.219
the genuine fruit peddler.

00:06:03.219 --> 00:06:06.800
As with other selling ruses of Izzy’s, his
fruit was good and the price was cheap- not

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.840
too cheap, because that would excite suspicion.

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:12.470
The exceptional bargains he offered in his
rounds of the combination saloon and lunch

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:16.790
counter places made him welcome and at the
opportune moment in each transaction the request

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:18.610
for a return favor was made.

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:21.319
In each case where it was granted there was
an arrest.

00:06:21.319 --> 00:06:22.319
..

00:06:22.319 --> 00:06:25.550
On a larger scale, “Izzy mastered trucking
an occasions too numerous to recount he has

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:30.009
in his capacity as chauffeur driven many a
load of his unsuspecting employer’s booze

00:06:30.009 --> 00:06:31.520
straight to a Government warehouse.

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:35.740
And not only the immediate load, but all the
rest of the supply from which it came.”

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:40.580
In yet another instance, the pair joined a
milk wagon strike, posing as milk wagon drivers.

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:44.650
When the strikers came close to victory, Izzy
and Moe convinced them to go to a certain

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:45.650
bar.

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:49.060
It was reported that when they walked in with
their fellow strikers, Izzy stated, “We’re

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:51.680
celebrating the expected victory of the strike.

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:53.120
Give us some ginger ale.”

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:57.090
Having no reason whatsoever to suspect Izzy
of being a Prohibition officer, he was with

00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:01.539
his fellow milk wagon strikers after all and
wasn’t even asking for an alcoholic beverage,

00:07:01.539 --> 00:07:04.770
the bartender reportedly replied, “A fine
way to celebrate.

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:08.939
You fellows have all the milk now, why don’t
you try some good old milk punches?

00:07:08.939 --> 00:07:11.460
You get the milk and well, you know what I
mean.”

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:15.469
When the spiked punch was served, Izzy delivered
the catch-phrase he used in nearly all such

00:07:15.469 --> 00:07:17.850
instances, “There’s sad news here.

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:19.039
You’re under arrest.”

00:07:19.039 --> 00:07:22.400
Izzy stated of what he called his “Einstein
Theory of Rum Snooping”,

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:23.639
It takes a little finesse.

00:07:23.639 --> 00:07:26.880
The main thing, it seems to me, is that you
have to be natural.

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:31.680
The hardest thing an agent has to do is to
really act as if he wanted and needed a drink.

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:34.810
That doesn’t mean you can walk in with the
stock excuse of a toothache.

00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:39.030
They’ve got stung on that story so many
times a man could roll over and die of it

00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:41.979
on the saloon floor and never get a drop.

00:07:41.979 --> 00:07:46.439
Beyond their skill and ability to gain people’s
trust quickly, unlike many Prohibition officers,

00:07:46.439 --> 00:07:51.189
Izzy and Moe were seemingly incorruptible,
flatly refusing bribes and openly inviting

00:07:51.189 --> 00:07:52.960
the press to oversee their busts.

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:57.139
In regards to the latter, the pair would notably
schedule their major busts for times that

00:07:57.139 --> 00:08:01.469
would be most beneficial to the tabloids (usually
the weekends so they had something to print

00:08:01.469 --> 00:08:05.639
on Monday), even inviting photographers and
journalists to tag along as they went about

00:08:05.639 --> 00:08:06.789
their duties.

00:08:06.789 --> 00:08:10.909
Along with encouraging the duo to don more
flamboyant disguises to keep the press interested,

00:08:10.909 --> 00:08:15.259
it also made them more brazen with the pair
frequently arranging to bust several dozen

00:08:15.259 --> 00:08:19.749
speakeasies in a single night clandestinely
followed by a flock of reporters.

00:08:19.749 --> 00:08:23.410
Izzy and Moe’s exploits were such that other
cities began making requests to the New York

00:08:23.410 --> 00:08:28.139
Police Department for their services, which
it complied with as a “gesture of goodwill”.

00:08:28.139 --> 00:08:32.099
While touring the country, Izzy had a standing
bet that he could catch a bootlegger within

00:08:32.099 --> 00:08:34.020
30 minutes of getting off the train.

00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:38.380
The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and
Explosives claims that Izzy only failed to

00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:41.380
deliver on this promise once, in Washington
D.C.

00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:45.089
They also noted that on one occasion, Izzy
and Moe astounded even themselves when they

00:08:45.089 --> 00:08:49.240
climbed into a cab in New Orleans directly
after getting off the train and asked the

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:51.070
driver if he knew where to get a drink.

00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:55.199
The driver dutifully offered to sell the men
a tot of whiskey and was immediately arrested.

00:08:55.199 --> 00:08:56.199
They’d been in New Orleans mere minutes.

00:08:56.199 --> 00:08:59.070
Though their flair for theatrics and use of
disguises became the stuff of legend amongst

00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:02.980
the press, law enforcement and criminals,
Izzy maintained that his favourite bust was

00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:07.860
a time he walked into a speakeasy with no
disguise and saw a giant picture of his own

00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:10.440
face on the wall surrounded by stories of
his exploits.

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:14.570
Curious to see if anyone would recognise him,
he stood below the photo for several minutes

00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:16.260
making the same expression.

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:20.380
Nobody noticed him until he pulled out a warrant
and explicitly made his presence known.

00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:23.839
The pair’s “vaudevillian” tactics, despite
earning them the kudos of the press (and if

00:09:23.839 --> 00:09:25.820
you’re curious, see: What’s a Kudo?),
riled the wrong people within the Bureau who

00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:30.360
resented the publicity their antics brought
and how incompetent Moe and Izzy’s arrest

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:32.820
record made other agents look.

00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:37.620
As a result, in 1925, both men were fired
as part of a “restructuring” of the force.

00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:41.910
Izzy later claimed in his book, Prohibition
Agent No. 1, that one official berated him

00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:45.139
saying, “You are merely a subordinate-not
the whole show.”

00:09:45.139 --> 00:09:49.820
(Interestingly, Moe was not mentioned once
in that book outlining the pair’s exploits.

00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:52.670
Izzy claims that was at Moe’s insistence.

00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:56.870
Possibly true, the pair seemed to remain on
friendly terms long after the book was published.)

00:09:56.870 --> 00:10:00.899
Izzy also claimed he was offered a transfer
to Chicago, but turned that job down as he

00:10:00.899 --> 00:10:03.500
wasn’t interested in going up against Al
Capone.

00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:06.920
After being let go, the pair used their people
skills to become quite successful insurance

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:07.920
salesmen.

00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:12.000
Izzy ultimately died of complications from
surgery after having his leg amputated (possibly

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.180
needing this done due to diabetes) in 1938
at age 58.

00:10:16.180 --> 00:11:00.680
Moe fared better, living to age 73, dying

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:03.030
in 1960.
