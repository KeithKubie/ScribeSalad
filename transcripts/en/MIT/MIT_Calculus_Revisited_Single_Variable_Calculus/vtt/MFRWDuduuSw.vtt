00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:40.020
PROFESSOR: Hi.

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.140
I'm Herb Gross, and welcome
to Calculus Revisited.

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.280
I guess the most difficult
lecture to give with any

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.440
course is probably
the first one.

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.260
And you're sort of tempted to
look at your audience and say

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.120
you're probably wondering why
I called you all here.

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.740
And in this sense, I have
elected to entitle our first

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:03.150
lecture simply Preface to give a
double overview, an overview

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:07.160
both of the hardware and the
software that will make up

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:08.680
this course.

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:13.240
To begin with, we will have a
series of lectures of which

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.080
this is the first.

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.150
In our lectures, our main aim
will be to give an overview of

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:22.880
the material being covered, an
insight as to why various

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.260
computations are done, and
insights as to how

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.710
applications of these concepts
will be made.

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:35.430
The heart of our course will
consist of a regular textbook.

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.630
You see, we have our lectures.

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.390
We have a textbook.

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.810
The textbook is designed to
supply you with deeper

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.610
insights than what we can
give in a lecture.

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:53.000
In addition, recognizing the
fact that the textbook may

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.430
leave gaps, places where you
may want some additional

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.030
knowledge, we also have
supplementary notes.

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:05.360
And finally, at the backbone of
our package is what we call

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:06.630
the study guide.

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.520
The study guide consists of
a breakdown of the course.

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.990
It tells us what the various
lectures will be, the units.

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:19.290
There are pretests to help you
decide how well prepared you

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.090
are for the topic that's
coming up.

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.640
There is a final examination
at the end of

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.300
each block of material.

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.640
And perhaps most importantly,
especially from an engineer's

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.450
point of view, in each unit that
we study, the study guide

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.970
will consist of exercises
primarily called learning

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.970
exercises, exercises which
hopefully will turn you on

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.060
towards wanting to be able to
apply the material, and at the

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.100
same time, serve as a
springboard by which we can

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.050
highlight why the theory and
many about our lecture points

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:56.780
are really as important
as they are.

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.140
So much for the hardware
of our course.

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.540
And now let's turn our attention
to the software.

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.920
Just what is calculus?

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.870
In a manner of speaking,
calculus can be viewed as

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.770
being high school mathematics
with one additional concept

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:16.150
called the limit concept
thrown in.

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.770
If you recall back to your high
school days, remember

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:21.250
that we're always dealing
with things like

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.390
average rate of speed.

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:26.400
Notice I say average or constant
rate of speed.

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.800
The old recipe that distance
equals rate times time

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.200
presupposes that the rate is
constant, because if the rate

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.750
is varying, which rate is it
that you use to multiply the

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.200
time by to find the distance?

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.760
You see, in other words, roughly
speaking, we can say

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.660
that at least one branch of
calculus known as differential

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.170
calculus deals with
the subject of

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:50.780
instantaneous speed.

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.730
And instantaneous speed is a
rather easy thing to talk

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:55.240
about intuitively.

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:59.740
Imagine an object moving along
this line and passing the

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:03.520
point P. And we say to ourselves
how fast was the

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:06.260
object moving at the instant
that we're at the point P?

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.700
Now, you see, this is some
sort of a problem.

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.560
Because at the instant that
you're at P, you're not in a

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.010
sense moving at all because
you're at P.

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:20.230
Of course, what we do to reduce
this problem to an old

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:24.190
one is we say, well, suppose we
have a couple of observers.

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:26.940
Let's call them O1 and O2.

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:30.500
Let them be stationed, one on
each side of P. Now, certainly

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.030
what we could do physically
here is we can measure the

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:37.910
distance between O1 and O2.

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:43.090
And we can also measure the
time that it takes to

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:46.420
go from O1 to O2.

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:50.270
And what we can do is divide
that distance by the time, and

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:54.670
that, you see, is our old high
school concept of the average

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:58.285
speed of the particle as
it moves from O1 to O2.

00:04:58.285 --> 00:05:01.330
Now, you see, the question is,
somebody says gee, that's a

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:03.780
great answer, but it's
the wrong problem.

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:05.920
We didn't ask what was the
average speed as we

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:07.420
went from O1 to O2.

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:09.730
We asked what was the
instantaneous speed.

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:11.700
And the idea is we say,
well, lookit.

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:14.880
The average speed and the
instantaneous speed, it seems,

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.740
should be pretty much the same
if the observers were

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:19.800
relatively close together.

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.670
The next observation is it seems
that if we were to move

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:26.820
the observers in even closer,
there would be less of a

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:31.440
discrepancy between O1 and O2
in the sense that-- not a

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:34.345
discrepancy, but in the sense
that the average speed would

00:05:34.345 --> 00:05:36.900
now seem like a better
approximation to the

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:39.480
instantaneous speed because
there was less distance for

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:41.725
something to go wrong in.

00:05:41.725 --> 00:05:45.220
And so we get the idea that
maybe what we should do is

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:48.480
make the observers gets closer
and closer together.

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:50.810
That would minimize the
difference between the average

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:54.380
speed and the instantaneous rate
of speed, and maybe the

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:56.480
optimal thing would happen
when the two

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:58.390
observers were together.

00:05:58.390 --> 00:05:59.870
But the strange part is--

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:02.080
and this is where calculus
really begins.

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:04.140
This is what calculus
is all about.

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:07.370
As soon as the observers come
together, notice that what you

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:10.420
have is that the distance
between them is 0.

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:13.430
The time that it takes to get
from one to the other is 0.

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:17.020
And therefore, it appears that
if we divide distance by time,

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:21.550
we are going to wind
up with 0/0.

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:25.630
Now, my claim is that 0/0
should be called--

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:30.190
well, I'll call it undefined,
but actually, I think

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:36.920
indeterminate would
be a better word.

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:38.415
Why do I say that?

00:06:38.415 --> 00:06:40.330
Well, here's an interesting
thing.

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:43.900
When we do arithmetic with small
numbers, observe that if

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:46.980
you add two small numbers, you
expect the result to be a

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:47.960
small number.

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:51.230
If you multiply two small
numbers, you expect the result

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:52.890
to be a small number.

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:57.280
Similarly, for division, for
subtraction, the difference of

00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:59.740
two small numbers is
a small number.

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:02.960
On the other hand, the quotient
of two small numbers

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:04.450
is rather deceptive.

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:08.000
Because it's a ratio, if one
of the very small numbers

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.390
happens to be very much larger
compared with the other small

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:15.200
number, the ratio might
be quite large.

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:19.960
Well, for example, visualize,
say, 10 to the minus 6,

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:27.470
1/1,000,000, 0.000001, which
is a pretty small number.

00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:32.310
Now, divide that by 10
to the minus 12th.

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:35.210
Well, you see, 10 to the minus
12th is a small number, so

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:38.220
small that it makes 10 to the
minus sixth appear large.

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:43.440
In fact, the quotient is 10 to
the sixth, which is 1,000,000.

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:46.210
And here we see that when you're
dealing with the ratio

00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:49.180
of small numbers, you're a
little bit in trouble, because

00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:53.310
we can't tell whether the ratio
will be small, or large,

00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:54.930
or somewhere in between.

00:07:54.930 --> 00:07:57.430
For example, if we reverse
the role of numerator and

00:07:57.430 --> 00:08:00.020
denominator here, we would still
have the quotient of two

00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:03.880
small numbers, but 10 to the
minus 12th divided by 10 to

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:11.930
the minus sixth is a relatively
small number, 10 to

00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:13.810
the minus 6.

00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:16.600
Of course, this is the physical
way of looking at it.

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:18.910
Small divided by small
is indeterminate.

00:08:18.910 --> 00:08:21.400
We have a more rigorous way of
looking at this if you want to

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:24.090
see it from a mathematical
structure point of view.

00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:28.540
Namely, suppose we define a/b
in the traditional way.

00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:33.059
Namely, a/b is that number such
that when we multiply it

00:08:33.059 --> 00:08:36.020
by b we get a.

00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:40.200
Well, what would that say as
far as 0/0 was concerned?

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:41.419
It would say what?

00:08:41.419 --> 00:08:45.060
That 0/0 is that number such
that when we multiply

00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:48.030
it by 0 we get 0.

00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:51.410
Now, what number has the
property that when we multiply

00:08:51.410 --> 00:08:53.330
it by 0 we get 0?

00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:55.890
And the answer is any number.

00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:58.380
This is why 0/0 is
indeterminate.

00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:01.630
If we say to a person, tell me
the number I must multiply by

00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:05.570
0 to get 0, the answer
is any number.

00:09:05.570 --> 00:09:08.850
Well, the idea then is that we
must avoid the expression 0/0

00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:10.310
at all costs.

00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:14.570
What this means then is that we
say OK, let the observers

00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:17.940
get closer to closer together,
but never touch.

00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:20.410
Now, the point is that as long
as the observers get closer

00:09:20.410 --> 00:09:23.970
and closer together and never
touch, let's ask the question

00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:26.300
how many pairs of observers
do we need?

00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:28.790
And the answer is that
theoretically we need

00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:31.400
infinitely many pairs
of observers.

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:32.740
Well, why is that?

00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:35.610
Because as long as there's a
distance between a pair of

00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:38.520
observers, we can theoretically
fit in another

00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:40.380
pair of observers.

00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:44.700
This is why in our course we do
not begin with this idea,

00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:48.340
but looking backwards now, we
say ah, we had better find

00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:51.140
some way of giving us the
equivalent of having

00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:53.290
infinitely many pairs
of observers.

00:09:53.290 --> 00:09:59.140
And to do this, the idea that we
come up with is the concept

00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:01.990
called a function.

00:10:01.990 --> 00:10:05.400
Consider the old Galileo freely
falling body problem,

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:09.520
where the distance that the
body falls s equals 16t

00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:12.950
squared, where t is in seconds
and s is in feet.

00:10:12.950 --> 00:10:17.760
Notice that this apparently
harmless recipe gives us a way

00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:21.250
for finding s for
each given t.

00:10:21.250 --> 00:10:24.650
In other words, to all intents
and purposes, this recipe

00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:28.992
gives us an observer for
each point of time.

00:10:28.992 --> 00:10:32.260
For each time, we can find the
distance, which is physically

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:36.330
equivalent to knowing an
observer at every point.

00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:40.430
In turn, the study of functions
lends itself to a

00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:43.220
study of graphs, a picture.

00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:47.590
Namely, if we look at s equals
16t squared again, notice that

00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:49.910
we visualize a recipe here.

00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:54.250
t can be viewed as being an
input, s as the output.

00:10:54.250 --> 00:10:58.560
For a given input t, we can
compute the output s.

00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:03.090
In general, if we now elect
to plot the input along a

00:11:03.090 --> 00:11:07.770
horizontal line and the output
at right angles to this, we

00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:11.270
now have a picture of our
relationship, a picture which

00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:14.200
is called a graph.

00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:17.980
You see, we can talk about this
more explicitly as far as

00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:20.830
this particular problem is
concerned, just by taking a

00:11:20.830 --> 00:11:22.650
look at a picture like this.

00:11:22.650 --> 00:11:25.810
In other words, in this
particular problem, the input

00:11:25.810 --> 00:11:30.970
is time t, the output
is distance s.

00:11:30.970 --> 00:11:35.270
For each t, we locate a height
called s by squaring t and

00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:37.450
multiplying by 16.

00:11:37.450 --> 00:11:40.390
And now, what average speed
means in terms of this kind of

00:11:40.390 --> 00:11:42.640
a diagram is the following.

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:46.410
To find the average speed, all
we have to do is on a given

00:11:46.410 --> 00:11:49.960
time interval find the distance
traveled, which I

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:53.510
call delta s, the change in
distance, and divide that by

00:11:53.510 --> 00:11:54.860
the change in time.

00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:58.030
That's the average speed, which,
by the way, from a

00:11:58.030 --> 00:12:02.150
geometrical point of view,
becomes known as the slope of

00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:03.820
this particular straight line.

00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:08.130
In other words, average speed is
to functions what slope of

00:12:08.130 --> 00:12:10.830
a straight line is
to geometry.

00:12:10.830 --> 00:12:14.190
At any rate, knowing what the
average rate of speed is, we

00:12:14.190 --> 00:12:18.570
sort of say why couldn't we
define the instantaneous speed

00:12:18.570 --> 00:12:19.500
to be this.

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:24.040
We will take the change in
distance divided by the change

00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:26.740
in time and see what happens.

00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:28.430
And we write this this way.

00:12:28.430 --> 00:12:30.450
Limit as delta t approaches 0.

00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:33.450
Let's see what happens as that
change in time becomes

00:12:33.450 --> 00:12:37.370
arbitrarily small, but never
equaling 0 because we don't

00:12:37.370 --> 00:12:39.820
want a 0/0 form here.

00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:44.260
You see, this then becomes the
working definition of what we

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:46.670
call differential calculus.

00:12:46.670 --> 00:12:50.390
The point is that this
particular definition does not

00:12:50.390 --> 00:12:53.240
depend on s equaling
16t squared.

00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:57.430
s could be any function
of t whatsoever.

00:12:57.430 --> 00:13:00.210
We could have a more elaborate
type of situation.

00:13:00.210 --> 00:13:02.170
The important point is what?

00:13:02.170 --> 00:13:05.420
The basic definition
stays the same.

00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:09.980
What changes is the amount of
arithmetic that's necessary to

00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:13.970
handle the particular
relationship between s and t.

00:13:13.970 --> 00:13:18.010
This will be a major part of our
course, the strange thing

00:13:18.010 --> 00:13:20.970
being that even at the very end
of our course when we've

00:13:20.970 --> 00:13:24.200
gone through many, many things,
our basic definition

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:26.790
of instantaneous rate of
change will have never

00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:27.960
changed from this.

00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:30.440
It will always stay like this.

00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:34.320
But what will change is how much
arithmetic and algebra

00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:38.250
and geometry and trigonometry,
et cetera, we will have to do

00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:40.350
in order to compute these
things from a

00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:42.170
numerical point of view.

00:13:42.170 --> 00:13:45.620
Well, so much for the first
phase of calculus called

00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:47.150
differential calculus.

00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:50.610
A second phase of calculus, one
which was developed by the

00:13:50.610 --> 00:13:54.510
Ancient Greeks by 600 BC, the
subject that ultimately

00:13:54.510 --> 00:13:58.200
becomes known as integral
calculus, concerns problem of

00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:00.954
finding area under a curve.

00:14:00.954 --> 00:14:07.200
Here, I've elected to draw the
parabola y equals x squared on

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:10.840
the interval from
0, 0 to 1, 0.

00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:17.290
And the question basically is
what is the area bounded by

00:14:17.290 --> 00:14:19.990
this sort of triangular
region?

00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:24.330
Let's call that region R, and
what we would like to find is

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:26.420
the area of the region R.

00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:30.310
And the Ancient Greeks had a
rather interesting title for

00:14:30.310 --> 00:14:32.300
this type of approach for
finding the area.

00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:35.400
It is both figurative and
literal, I guess.

00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:36.810
It's called the method
of exhaustion.

00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:40.754
What they did was to --

00:14:40.754 --> 00:14:42.610
They would divide the
interval, say,

00:14:42.610 --> 00:14:44.530
into n equal parts.

00:14:44.530 --> 00:14:47.570
And picking the lowest point in
each interval, they would

00:14:47.570 --> 00:14:50.940
inscribe a rectangle.

00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:53.500
Knowing that the area of the
rectangle was the base times

00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:57.110
the height, they would add up
the area of each of these

00:14:57.110 --> 00:15:00.880
rectangles, and know that
whatever that area was, that

00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:04.540
would have to be too small to
be the right answer because

00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:07.040
that region was contained
in R. And that would be

00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:08.780
labeled A sub n--

00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:10.120
lower bar, say--

00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:13.130
to indicate that this was a sum
of rectangles which was

00:15:13.130 --> 00:15:15.780
too small to be the
right answer.

00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:20.210
Similarly, they would then find
the highest point in each

00:15:20.210 --> 00:15:24.430
rectangle, get an
overapproximation by adding up

00:15:24.430 --> 00:15:28.240
the sum of those areas, which
they would call A sub n upper

00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:31.050
bar, and now know that the area
of the regions they were

00:15:31.050 --> 00:15:34.260
looking for was squeezed
in between these two.

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:37.530
Then what they would do is make
more and more divisions,

00:15:37.530 --> 00:15:40.320
and hopefully, and I think
you can see this sort of

00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:42.840
intuitively happening here,
each of the lower

00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:45.910
approximations gets bigger
and fills out

00:15:45.910 --> 00:15:47.970
the space from inside.

00:15:47.970 --> 00:15:51.730
Each of the upper approximations
gets smaller

00:15:51.730 --> 00:15:54.770
and chops off the space
from outside here.

00:15:54.770 --> 00:16:01.530
And hopefully, if both of these
bounds sort of converge

00:16:01.530 --> 00:16:05.520
to the same value L, we get the
idea that the area of the

00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:08.130
region R must be L.

00:16:08.130 --> 00:16:09.780
This is not anything new.

00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:12.700
In other words, this is a
technique that is some 2,500

00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:16.820
years old, used by the
Ancient Greeks.

00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:19.030
Of course, what happens with
engineering students in

00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:22.620
general is that one frequently
says, but I'm not interested

00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:23.920
in studying area.

00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:25.630
I am not a geometer.

00:16:25.630 --> 00:16:26.720
I am a physicist.

00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:28.370
I am an engineer.

00:16:28.370 --> 00:16:30.990
What good is the area
under a curve?

00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:35.510
And the interesting point here
becomes that if we label the

00:16:35.510 --> 00:16:39.450
coordinate axis rather than x
and y, give them physical

00:16:39.450 --> 00:16:43.490
labels, it turns out that area
under a curve has a physical

00:16:43.490 --> 00:16:44.880
interpretation.

00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:46.390
Consider the same problem.

00:16:46.390 --> 00:16:50.270
Only now, instead of talking
about y equals x squared,

00:16:50.270 --> 00:16:53.340
let's talk about v, the
velocity, equaling the square

00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:54.460
of the time.

00:16:54.460 --> 00:16:57.080
And say that the time
goes to 0 to 1.

00:16:57.080 --> 00:17:00.870
In other words, if we plot
v versus t, we get a

00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:02.380
picture like this.

00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:05.670
And the question that comes up
is what do we mean by the area

00:17:05.670 --> 00:17:07.010
under the curve here?

00:17:07.010 --> 00:17:09.890
And again, without belaboring
this point, not because it's

00:17:09.890 --> 00:17:12.980
not important, but because this
is just an overview and

00:17:12.980 --> 00:17:15.680
we'll come back to all of these
topics later in our

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:19.849
course, the point I just want
to bring out here is, notice

00:17:19.849 --> 00:17:23.490
that the area under the curve
here is the distance that this

00:17:23.490 --> 00:17:28.820
particle would travel moving at
this speed if the time goes

00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:30.460
from 0 to 1.

00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:32.180
And notice what we're
saying here.

00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:36.670
Again, suppose we divide this
interval into n equal parts

00:17:36.670 --> 00:17:39.760
and inscribe rectangles.

00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:43.100
Notice that each of
these rectangles

00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:44.580
represents a distance.

00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:53.730
Namely, if a particle moved at
the speed over this length of

00:17:53.730 --> 00:17:57.220
time, the area under the curve
would be the distance that it

00:17:57.220 --> 00:17:59.400
traveled during that
time interval.

00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:02.040
In other words, what we're
saying is that if the particle

00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:05.850
moved at this speed from this
time to this time, then moved

00:18:05.850 --> 00:18:10.200
at this speed from this time to
this time, the sum of these

00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:12.830
two areas would give the
distance that the particle

00:18:12.830 --> 00:18:17.110
traveled, which obviously is
less than the distance that

00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:19.640
the particle truly traveled,
because notice that the

00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:22.957
particle was moving at a speed
which at every instance from

00:18:22.957 --> 00:18:26.770
here to here was greater than
this and at every instant from

00:18:26.770 --> 00:18:28.690
here to here was greater
than this.

00:18:28.690 --> 00:18:32.180
In other words, in the same way
as before, that area of

00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:39.580
the region R was whittled in
between A sub n upper bar and

00:18:39.580 --> 00:18:43.250
A sub n lower bar, notice that
the distance traveled by the

00:18:43.250 --> 00:18:48.280
particle can now be limited or
bounded in the same way.

00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:52.470
And in the same way that we
found area as a limit, we can

00:18:52.470 --> 00:18:55.390
now find distance as a limit.

00:18:55.390 --> 00:18:58.740
And these two things,
namely, what?

00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:02.750
Instantaneous speed and area
under a curve are the two

00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:05.960
essential branches of calculus,
differential

00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:10.000
calculus being concerned with
instantaneous rate of speed,

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.790
integral calculus with
area under a curve.

00:19:12.790 --> 00:19:17.560
And the beauty of calculus,
surprisingly enough, in a way

00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:19.530
is only secondary
as far as these

00:19:19.530 --> 00:19:21.020
two topics are concerned.

00:19:21.020 --> 00:19:24.690
The true beauty lies in the fact
that these apparently two

00:19:24.690 --> 00:19:27.430
different branches of calculus,
one of which was

00:19:27.430 --> 00:19:30.850
invented by the Ancient Greeks
as early as 600 BC,

00:19:30.850 --> 00:19:32.030
the other of which--

00:19:32.030 --> 00:19:33.070
differential calculus--

00:19:33.070 --> 00:19:37.370
was not known to man until the
time of Isaac Newton in 1690

00:19:37.370 --> 00:19:41.070
AD are related by a rather
remarkable thing.

00:19:41.070 --> 00:19:44.480
That remarkable thing, which
we will emphasize at great

00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:49.440
length during our course, is
that areas and rates of change

00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:52.245
are related by area
under a curve.

00:19:52.245 --> 00:19:54.600
Now, I don't know how to draw
this so that you see this

00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:58.630
thing as vividly as possible,
but the idea is this.

00:19:58.630 --> 00:20:04.150
Think of area being swept out as
we take a line and move it,

00:20:04.150 --> 00:20:07.400
tracing out the curve this
way towards the right.

00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:13.580
Notice that if we have a certain
amount of area, if we

00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:18.110
now move a little bit further to
the right, notice that the

00:20:18.110 --> 00:20:24.840
new area somehow depends on what
the height of this curve

00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:26.570
is going to be.

00:20:26.570 --> 00:20:30.130
That somehow or other, it seems
that the area under the

00:20:30.130 --> 00:20:35.190
curve must be related to how
fast the height of this line

00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:36.320
is changing.

00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:40.670
Or to look at it inversely, how
fast the area is changing

00:20:40.670 --> 00:20:44.670
should somehow be related to
the height of this line.

00:20:44.670 --> 00:20:47.000
And just what that relationship
is will be

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.730
explored also in great
detail in the course.

00:20:49.730 --> 00:20:53.210
And we will show the beautiful
marriage between this

00:20:53.210 --> 00:20:56.390
differential and integral
calculus through this

00:20:56.390 --> 00:20:59.150
relationship here, which
becomes known as the

00:20:59.150 --> 00:21:02.550
fundamental theorem of
integral calculus.

00:21:02.550 --> 00:21:06.420
At any rate then, what this
should show us is that

00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:07.900
calculus hinges--

00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:12.410
whether it's differential
calculus or integral calculus,

00:21:12.410 --> 00:21:13.960
that calculus hinges
on something

00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:15.730
called the limit concept.

00:21:15.730 --> 00:21:18.930
Again, by way of a very
quick review, one

00:21:18.930 --> 00:21:19.910
of the limit concepts--

00:21:19.910 --> 00:21:22.380
and I think it's easy to see
geometrically rather than

00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:23.300
analytically.

00:21:23.300 --> 00:21:26.410
Imagine that we have a curve,
and we want to find the

00:21:26.410 --> 00:21:30.080
tangent of the curve at the
point P. What we can do is

00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:34.120
take a point Q and draw the
straight line that joins P to

00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:38.690
Q. We could then find the
slope of the line PQ.

00:21:38.690 --> 00:21:41.940
The trouble is that PQ does not
look very much like the

00:21:41.940 --> 00:21:42.930
tangent line.

00:21:42.930 --> 00:21:48.300
So we say OK, let Q move down
so it comes closer to P. We

00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:50.740
can then find the
slopes of PQ1.

00:21:50.740 --> 00:21:53.390
We could find the
slope of PQ2.

00:21:53.390 --> 00:21:57.160
But in each case, we still do
not have the slope of the line

00:21:57.160 --> 00:22:01.370
tangent to the curve at P. But
we get the idea that as Q gets

00:22:01.370 --> 00:22:05.710
closer and closer to P, the
slope, or the secant line that

00:22:05.710 --> 00:22:10.040
joins P to Q, becomes a better
and better approximation to

00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:13.190
the line that would be tangent
to the curve at P.

00:22:13.190 --> 00:22:16.270
In fact, it's rather interesting
that in the 16th

00:22:16.270 --> 00:22:20.280
century, the definition that
was given of a tangent line

00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:25.390
was that a tangent line is a
line which passes through two

00:22:25.390 --> 00:22:27.250
consecutive points on a curve.

00:22:27.250 --> 00:22:29.560
Now, obviously, a curve
does not have

00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:31.270
two consecutive points.

00:22:31.270 --> 00:22:32.650
What they really
meant was what?

00:22:32.650 --> 00:22:37.600
That as Q gets closer and closer
to P, the secant line

00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:40.040
becomes a better and better
approximation for the tangent

00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:43.970
line, and that in a way, if the
two points were allowed to

00:22:43.970 --> 00:22:47.120
coincide, that should give
us the perfect answer.

00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:51.585
The trouble is, just like you
can't divide 0 by 0, if P and

00:22:51.585 --> 00:22:54.560
Q coincide, how many
points do you have?

00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:55.990
Just one point.

00:22:55.990 --> 00:22:59.550
And it takes two points to
determine a straight line.

00:22:59.550 --> 00:23:03.140
No matter how close Q is to P,
we have two distinct points.

00:23:03.140 --> 00:23:06.050
As soon as Q touches
P, we lose this.

00:23:06.050 --> 00:23:10.060
And this is what was meant by
ancient man or medieval man by

00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:12.530
his notion of two consecutive
points.

00:23:12.530 --> 00:23:16.130
And I should put this in double
quotes because I think

00:23:16.130 --> 00:23:19.940
you can see what he's begging
to try to say with the word

00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:22.990
"consecutive," even though from
a purely rigorous point

00:23:22.990 --> 00:23:26.280
of view, this has no
geometric meaning.

00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:30.580
Now, the other form of limit has
to do with adding up areas

00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:32.480
of rectangles under curves.

00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:35.370
Namely, we divided the curve
up into n parts.

00:23:35.370 --> 00:23:38.600
We inscribed n rectangles,
and then we let n

00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:40.320
increase without bound.

00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:44.700
In other words, this is sort of
a discrete type of limit.

00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:49.190
Namely, we must add up a whole
number of areas, but the sum

00:23:49.190 --> 00:23:52.590
is endless in the sense that
the number of rectangles

00:23:52.590 --> 00:23:56.390
becomes greater than any number
we want to preassign.

00:23:56.390 --> 00:24:02.350
And the basic question that we
must contend with here is how

00:24:02.350 --> 00:24:04.230
big is an infinite sum?

00:24:04.230 --> 00:24:07.060
You see, when we say infinite
sum, that just tells you how

00:24:07.060 --> 00:24:08.540
many terms you're combining.

00:24:08.540 --> 00:24:11.800
It doesn't tell you how
big each term, how big

00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:12.930
the sum will be.

00:24:12.930 --> 00:24:15.410
For example, look at
the following sum.

00:24:15.410 --> 00:24:17.310
I will start with 1.

00:24:17.310 --> 00:24:19.640
Then I'll add 1/2 on twice.

00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:23.040
Then I'll add 1/3
on three times.

00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:25.990
And without belaboring this
point, let me then say I'll

00:24:25.990 --> 00:24:30.960
had on 1/4 four times,
1/5 five times, 1/6

00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:33.710
six times, et cetera.

00:24:33.710 --> 00:24:37.890
Notice as I do this that each
time the terms gets smaller,

00:24:37.890 --> 00:24:41.190
yet the sum increases
without any bound.

00:24:41.190 --> 00:24:43.980
Namely, notice that
this adds up to 1.

00:24:43.980 --> 00:24:45.400
This adds up to 1.

00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:47.640
The next four terms
will add up to 1.

00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:51.050
And as I go out further and
further, notice that this sum

00:24:51.050 --> 00:24:53.470
can become as great is
I want, just by me

00:24:53.470 --> 00:24:55.320
adding on enough 1's.

00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:57.850
On the other hand, let's
look at this one.

00:24:57.850 --> 00:25:05.160
1 plus 1/2 plus 1/4 plus 1/8
plus 1/16 plus 1/32.

00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:09.300
In other words, I start with 1
and each time add on half the

00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:10.430
previous number.

00:25:10.430 --> 00:25:13.310
See, 1 plus 1/2 plus
1/4 plus 1/8.

00:25:13.310 --> 00:25:17.320
You may remember this as being
the geometric series whose

00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:20.240
ratio is 1/2.

00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:25.140
The interesting thing is that
now this sum gets as close to

00:25:25.140 --> 00:25:28.230
2 as you want without
ever getting there.

00:25:28.230 --> 00:25:30.790
And rather than prove this right
now, let's just look at

00:25:30.790 --> 00:25:33.690
the geometric interpretation
here.

00:25:33.690 --> 00:25:37.130
Take a line which is
2 inches long.

00:25:37.130 --> 00:25:39.290
Suppose you first go halfway.

00:25:39.290 --> 00:25:40.500
You're now here.

00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:42.620
Now go half the remaining
distance.

00:25:42.620 --> 00:25:43.080
That's what?

00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:44.080
1 plus 1/2.

00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:45.600
That puts you over here.

00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:47.860
Now go half the remaining
distance.

00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:49.990
That means add on 1/4.

00:25:49.990 --> 00:25:51.900
Now go half the remaining
distance.

00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:53.580
That means add on on 1/8.

00:25:53.580 --> 00:25:55.420
Now go half the remaining
distance.

00:25:55.420 --> 00:25:57.720
Add up this on 1/16, you see.

00:25:57.720 --> 00:25:59.260
And ultimately, what happens?

00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:02.150
Well, no matter where you stop,
you've become closer and

00:26:02.150 --> 00:26:04.570
closer to 2 without ever
getting there.

00:26:04.570 --> 00:26:06.970
And as you go further and
further, you can get as close

00:26:06.970 --> 00:26:08.500
to 2 as you want.

00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:11.550
In other words, here are
infinitely many terms whose

00:26:11.550 --> 00:26:13.450
infinite sum is 2.

00:26:13.450 --> 00:26:18.020
Here are infinitely many terms
whose infinite sum is

00:26:18.020 --> 00:26:19.410
infinity, we should
say, because it

00:26:19.410 --> 00:26:20.790
increases without bound.

00:26:20.790 --> 00:26:23.760
And this was the problem that
hung up the Ancient Greek.

00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:26.370
How could you do infinitely
many things in a

00:26:26.370 --> 00:26:27.830
finite amount of time?

00:26:27.830 --> 00:26:31.440
In fact, at the same time that
the Greek was developing

00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:36.020
integral calculus, the famous
greek philosopher Zeno was

00:26:36.020 --> 00:26:39.190
working on things called
Zeno's paradoxes.

00:26:39.190 --> 00:26:42.780
And Zeno's paradoxes are three
in number, of which I only

00:26:42.780 --> 00:26:44.340
want to quote one here.

00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:47.720
But it's a paradox which shows
how Zeno could not visualize

00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:49.500
quite what was happening.

00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:52.810
You see, it's called the
Tortoise and the Hare problem.

00:26:52.810 --> 00:26:56.870
Suppose that you give the
Tortoise a 1 yard head start

00:26:56.870 --> 00:26:58.360
on the Hare.

00:26:58.360 --> 00:27:00.920
And suppose for the sake of
argument, just to mimic the

00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:03.560
problem that we were doing
before, suppose it's a slow

00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:06.840
Hare and a fast Tortoise so that
the Hare only runs twice

00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:08.660
as fast as the Tortoise.

00:27:08.660 --> 00:27:11.680
You see, Zeno's paradox says
that the Hare can never catch

00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:12.480
the Tortoise.

00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:13.360
Why?

00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:16.680
Because to catch the Tortoise,
the Hare must first go the 1

00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:18.960
yard head start that
the Tortoise had.

00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:22.010
Well, by the time the Hare gets
here, the Tortoise has

00:27:22.010 --> 00:27:25.750
gone 1/2 yard because the
Tortoise travels half as fast.

00:27:25.750 --> 00:27:27.650
Now, the Hare must make
up the 1/2 yard.

00:27:27.650 --> 00:27:30.860
But while the Hare makes up
the 1/2 yard, the Tortoise

00:27:30.860 --> 00:27:32.730
goes 1/4 of a yard.

00:27:32.730 --> 00:27:36.300
When the Hare makes up the 1/4
of a yard, the Tortoise goes

00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:37.470
1/8 of a yard.

00:27:37.470 --> 00:27:40.930
And so, Zeno argues, the Hare
gets closer and closer to the

00:27:40.930 --> 00:27:43.830
Tortoise but can't catch him.

00:27:43.830 --> 00:27:46.140
And this, of course, is a rather
strange thing because

00:27:46.140 --> 00:27:49.300
Zeno knew that the Tortoise
would catch the Hare.

00:27:49.300 --> 00:27:50.940
That's it's called a paradox.

00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:54.000
A paradox means something which
appears to be true yet

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.010
is obviously false.

00:27:56.010 --> 00:27:59.380
Now, notice that we can resolve
Zeno's paradox into

00:27:59.380 --> 00:28:01.370
the example we were just
talking about.

00:28:01.370 --> 00:28:03.880
For the sake of argument, notice
what's happening here

00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:04.760
with the time.

00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:07.160
For the sake of argument,
let's suppose that the

00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:09.800
Tortoise travels at
1 yard per second.

00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:10.900
Then what you're saying is--

00:28:10.900 --> 00:28:12.890
I mean, the Hare travels
at 1 yard per second.

00:28:12.890 --> 00:28:15.460
What you're saying is
it takes the Hare 1

00:28:15.460 --> 00:28:17.850
second to go this distance.

00:28:17.850 --> 00:28:22.190
Then it takes him 1/2 a second
to go this distance, then 1/4

00:28:22.190 --> 00:28:24.760
of a second to go
this distance.

00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:27.210
And what you're saying is that
as he's gaining on the

00:28:27.210 --> 00:28:29.630
Tortoise, these are the time
intervals which are

00:28:29.630 --> 00:28:30.910
transpiring.

00:28:30.910 --> 00:28:34.710
And this sum turns
out to be 2.

00:28:34.710 --> 00:28:38.050
Now, of course, those of us who
had eighth grade algebra

00:28:38.050 --> 00:28:40.690
know an easier way of solving
this problem.

00:28:40.690 --> 00:28:44.285
We say lookit, let's solve this
problem algebraically.

00:28:44.285 --> 00:28:49.390
Namely, we say give the Tortoise
a 1 yard head start.

00:28:49.390 --> 00:28:55.170
Now call x the distance of
a point at which the Hare

00:28:55.170 --> 00:28:56.780
catches the Tortoise.

00:28:56.780 --> 00:28:59.610
Now, the Hare is traveling
1 yard per second.

00:28:59.610 --> 00:29:05.380
The Tortoise is traveling
1/2 yard per second, OK?

00:29:05.380 --> 00:29:12.400
So if we take the distance
traveled and divided by the

00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:16.890
rate, that should be the time.

00:29:16.890 --> 00:29:19.600
And since they both are at this
point at the same time,

00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:24.800
we get what? x/1 equals x
minus 1 divided by 1/2.

00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:28.410
And assuming as a prerequisite
that we have had algebra, it

00:29:28.410 --> 00:29:32.270
follows almost trivially
that x equals 2.

00:29:32.270 --> 00:29:36.790
In other words, what this says
is, in reality, that the Hare

00:29:36.790 --> 00:29:39.540
will not overtake the Tortoise
until he catches

00:29:39.540 --> 00:29:41.900
him, which is obvious.

00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:43.740
But what's not so
obvious is what?

00:29:43.740 --> 00:29:46.270
That these infinitely
many terms can add

00:29:46.270 --> 00:29:48.370
up to a finite sum.

00:29:48.370 --> 00:29:52.420
Well, at any rate, this complete
the overview of what

00:29:52.420 --> 00:29:53.430
our course will be like.

00:29:53.430 --> 00:29:58.890
And to help you focus your
attention on what our course

00:29:58.890 --> 00:30:03.450
really says, what we shall do
computationally is this.

00:30:03.450 --> 00:30:06.610
In review, we shall start with
functions, and functions

00:30:06.610 --> 00:30:09.800
involve the modern concept
of sets because they're

00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:12.230
relationships between
sets of objects.

00:30:12.230 --> 00:30:16.680
We'll talk about limits,
derivatives, rate of change,

00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:18.980
integrals, area under curves.

00:30:18.980 --> 00:30:22.080
This will be our fundamental
building block.

00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:25.230
Once this is done, these things
will never change.

00:30:25.230 --> 00:30:28.540
But the remainder of our course
will be to talk about

00:30:28.540 --> 00:30:31.470
applications, which is the name
of the game as far as

00:30:31.470 --> 00:30:33.220
engineering is concerned.

00:30:33.220 --> 00:30:36.300
More elaborate functions,
namely, how do we handle

00:30:36.300 --> 00:30:37.990
tougher relationships.

00:30:37.990 --> 00:30:41.130
Related to the tougher
relationships will come more

00:30:41.130 --> 00:30:43.560
sophisticated techniques.

00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:46.900
And finally, we will conclude
our course with the topic that

00:30:46.900 --> 00:30:50.020
we were just talking about:
infinite series, how do we get

00:30:50.020 --> 00:30:53.690
a hold of what happens when
you add up infinitely many

00:30:53.690 --> 00:30:56.060
things, each of which
gets small.

00:30:56.060 --> 00:31:00.750
At any rate, that concludes
our lecture for today.

00:31:00.750 --> 00:31:04.820
We will have a digression in
the sense that the next few

00:31:04.820 --> 00:31:09.540
lessons will consist of sets,
things that you can read about

00:31:09.540 --> 00:31:12.160
at your leisure in our
supplementary notes.

00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:15.400
Learn to understand these
because the concept of a set

00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:18.970
is the building block, the
fundamental language of modern

00:31:18.970 --> 00:31:20.300
mathematics.

00:31:20.300 --> 00:31:24.470
And then we will return, once we
have sets underway, to talk

00:31:24.470 --> 00:31:26.680
about functions.

00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:29.310
And then we will build
gradually from there.

00:31:29.310 --> 00:31:31.840
Hopefully, when our course ends,
we will have in slow

00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:35.310
motion gone through
today's lesson.

00:31:35.310 --> 00:31:37.620
This completes our presentation
for today.

00:31:37.620 --> 00:31:39.630
And until next time, goodbye.
