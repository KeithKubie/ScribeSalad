know the same processes are there we've

00:00:14.859 --> 00:00:14.869
know the same processes are there we've
 

00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:17.170

what about stigma and prejudice between

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:25.790
what about stigma and prejudice between
 

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:28.990
what about stigma and prejudice between
people so it isn't just in the

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:29.000
people so it isn't just in the
 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.499
people so it isn't just in the
psychotherapy areas and why that would

00:00:32.499 --> 00:00:32.509
psychotherapy areas and why that would
 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:35.650
psychotherapy areas and why that would
be as an empirical fact there's a pretty

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:35.660
be as an empirical fact there's a pretty
 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.990
be as an empirical fact there's a pretty
enormous breadth to these methods and

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:40.000
enormous breadth to these methods and
 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.540
enormous breadth to these methods and
the why that would be because everywhere

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:43.550
the why that would be because everywhere
 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.600
the why that would be because everywhere
that a human mind goes these processes

that a human mind goes these processes
 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:49.600
that a human mind goes these processes
of avoiding the world within in order to

that you'll know more about the places

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:05.840
that you'll know more about the places
 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.649
that you'll know more about the places
where you hurt those kinds of processes

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:08.659
where you hurt those kinds of processes
 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:12.609
where you hurt those kinds of processes
are just normal psychological processes

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:12.619
are just normal psychological processes
 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:14.319
are just normal psychological processes
that are built-in to language and

00:01:14.319 --> 00:01:14.329
that are built-in to language and
 

00:01:14.329 --> 00:01:16.629
that are built-in to language and
cognition itself they're built into

00:01:16.629 --> 00:01:16.639
cognition itself they're built into
 

00:01:16.639 --> 00:01:19.779
cognition itself they're built into
problem-solving and so if you take the

00:01:19.779 --> 00:01:19.789
problem-solving and so if you take the
 

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:23.020
problem-solving and so if you take the
mode of mind that works great in 95

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030

it then implodes it it starts creating

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350
it then implodes it it starts creating
 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:32.440
it then implodes it it starts creating
barriers and that's true at work it's

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450
barriers and that's true at work it's
 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.050
barriers and that's true at work it's
true in our organizations that's true in

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060
true in our organizations that's true in
 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.809

our culture during our politics and yeah
it's true in our consulting rooms so

00:01:39.669 --> 00:01:39.679
it's true in our consulting rooms so
 

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:41.769
it's true in our consulting rooms so
we're going the reason why it spreads

00:01:41.769 --> 00:01:41.779
we're going the reason why it spreads
 

00:01:41.779 --> 00:01:44.169
we're going the reason why it spreads
out we have pretty good evidence for

00:01:44.169 --> 00:01:44.179
out we have pretty good evidence for
 

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:45.910
out we have pretty good evidence for
this I know it sounds a little grandiose

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920
this I know it sounds a little grandiose
 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.999
this I know it sounds a little grandiose
but the mental cognitive processes that

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:49.009
but the mental cognitive processes that
 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:51.159
but the mental cognitive processes that
we're targeting are ones that narrow

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:51.169
we're targeting are ones that narrow
 

00:01:51.169 --> 00:01:53.289
we're targeting are ones that narrow
human beings repertoire and make it

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:53.299
human beings repertoire and make it
 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:55.179
human beings repertoire and make it
harder for them to learn to be more

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:55.189
harder for them to learn to be more
 

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:57.159
harder for them to learn to be more
flexible to take advantage of the

00:01:57.159 --> 00:01:57.169
flexible to take advantage of the
 

00:01:57.169 --> 00:01:59.769
flexible to take advantage of the
opportunities in front of them and we

00:01:59.769 --> 00:01:59.779
opportunities in front of them and we
 

00:01:59.779 --> 00:02:03.510
opportunities in front of them and we
think that's something we can have

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520
think that's something we can have
 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.769
think that's something we can have
something to say about some of the help

00:02:05.769 --> 00:02:05.779
something to say about some of the help
 

00:02:05.779 --> 00:02:07.620
something to say about some of the help
within all of these different areas

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630
within all of these different areas
 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.880
within all of these different areas
maybe even in areas like child

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890
maybe even in areas like child
 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.010

other so we've taken the work for

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460
other so we've taken the work for
 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.100
other so we've taken the work for
example into things like prejudice and

example into things like prejudice and
 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.080
example into things like prejudice and
stigma because in the modern world if we

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090
stigma because in the modern world if we
 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.390
stigma because in the modern world if we
can't solve that we have planes flying

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400
can't solve that we have planes flying
 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.280
can't solve that we have planes flying
into buildings and then we have planes

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290
into buildings and then we have planes
 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.840
into buildings and then we have planes
flying over countries you know the

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:31.850
flying over countries you know the
 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:35.720
flying over countries you know the
amount of hate and objectification and

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730
amount of hate and objectification and
 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.430
amount of hate and objectification and
dehumanization that's on the planet

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440
dehumanization that's on the planet
 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.850
dehumanization that's on the planet
isn't something we can tolerate anymore

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860
isn't something we can tolerate anymore
 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.340
isn't something we can tolerate anymore
in a world and that's coming of suitcase

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350
in a world and that's coming of suitcase
 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.890
in a world and that's coming of suitcase
bombs and the ability to amplify that

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900
bombs and the ability to amplify that
 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.470
bombs and the ability to amplify that
hate out into harm towards each other so

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480
hate out into harm towards each other so
 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.540
hate out into harm towards each other so
it applies broadly because anywhere that
