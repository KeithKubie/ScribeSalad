00:00:00.482 --> 00:00:03.260
- [Voiceover] So we've
got this function f of x

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:05.768
that is a piecewise continuous.

00:00:05.768 --> 00:00:09.231
It's defined over several intervals here

00:00:09.231 --> 00:00:11.238
for x being,

00:00:11.238 --> 00:00:13.262
or for zero less than x,

00:00:13.262 --> 00:00:15.259
and being less than or equal to two.

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:17.011
F of x is natural log of x.

00:00:17.011 --> 00:00:20.237
For any x's larger than two, well then,

00:00:20.237 --> 00:00:21.510
f of x is going to be x squared

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.418
times the natural log of x.

00:00:23.418 --> 00:00:24.716
And what we wanna do is

00:00:24.716 --> 00:00:26.347
we wanna find the limit of f of x

00:00:26.347 --> 00:00:28.535
as x approaches two.

00:00:28.535 --> 00:00:30.633
Now, what's interesting
about the value two

00:00:30.633 --> 00:00:33.687
is that that's essentially
the boundary between

00:00:33.687 --> 00:00:34.821
these two intervals.

00:00:34.821 --> 00:00:36.202
If we wanted to evaluate it at two,

00:00:36.202 --> 00:00:38.095
we would fall into this first interval.

00:00:38.095 --> 00:00:41.243
F of two, well, two is
less than or equal to two,

00:00:41.243 --> 00:00:42.748
and it's greater than zero.

00:00:42.748 --> 00:00:46.652
So f of two would be
pretty straightforward.

00:00:46.652 --> 00:00:48.390
That would just be natural log of two.

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.981
But that's not necessarily
what the limit is going to be.

00:00:51.981 --> 00:00:53.431
To figure out what the
limit is going to be,

00:00:53.431 --> 00:00:54.264
we should think about, well,

00:00:54.264 --> 00:00:56.047
what's the limit as we
approach from the left,

00:00:56.047 --> 00:00:57.887
what's the limit as we
approach from the right,

00:00:57.887 --> 00:01:00.028
and do those exist, and if they do exist,

00:01:00.028 --> 00:01:00.910
are they the same thing,

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:02.868
and if they are the same thing, well then,

00:01:02.868 --> 00:01:04.726
we have a well-defined limit.

00:01:04.726 --> 00:01:06.840
So let's do that.

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.499
Let's first think about the limit.

00:01:10.499 --> 00:01:14.485
The limit of f of x as we approach two

00:01:14.485 --> 00:01:17.985
from the left, from values lower than two.

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.223
Well, this is gonna be the case

00:01:21.223 --> 00:01:24.004
where we're gonna be
operating in this interval

00:01:24.004 --> 00:01:25.027
right over here.

00:01:25.027 --> 00:01:28.370
We're operating from values less than two,

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:30.369
and we're going to be approaching two

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:32.231
from the left.

00:01:32.231 --> 00:01:35.224
And so we'll fall under this clause,

00:01:35.224 --> 00:01:38.726
and so, since this clause or case

00:01:38.726 --> 00:01:40.688
is continuous over the interval

00:01:40.688 --> 00:01:41.809
in which we're operating,

00:01:41.809 --> 00:01:45.252
and for sure between, or for
all values greater than zero

00:01:45.252 --> 00:01:46.893
and less than or equal to two,

00:01:46.893 --> 00:01:49.716
this limit is going to be equal to

00:01:49.716 --> 00:01:51.991
just this clause evaluated at two,

00:01:51.991 --> 00:01:54.267
because it's continuous over the interval.

00:01:54.267 --> 00:01:58.268
So this is just going to
be the natural log of two.

00:01:58.268 --> 00:02:00.773
All right, so now let's
think about the limit

00:02:00.773 --> 00:02:02.171
from the right hand side,

00:02:02.171 --> 00:02:04.741
from values greater than two.

00:02:04.741 --> 00:02:06.574
So the limit of f of x

00:02:09.512 --> 00:02:13.716
as x approaches two from
the right hand side.

00:02:13.716 --> 00:02:16.142
Well, even though two
falls into this clause,

00:02:16.142 --> 00:02:18.518
as soon as we go anything
greater than two,

00:02:18.518 --> 00:02:19.876
we fall in this clause.

00:02:19.876 --> 00:02:21.750
So we're gonna be approaching two

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.276
essentially using this case.

00:02:24.276 --> 00:02:26.753
And once again, this case here

00:02:26.753 --> 00:02:29.503
is continuous for all x values

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:33.513
not only greater than two,

00:02:33.513 --> 00:02:36.572
actually, you know, greater
than or equal to two.

00:02:36.572 --> 00:02:39.556
And so, for this one over here,

00:02:39.556 --> 00:02:42.013
we can make the same
argument that this limit

00:02:42.013 --> 00:02:45.680
is going to be this
clause evaluated at two,

00:02:46.986 --> 00:02:49.503
because once again, if we just evaluated

00:02:49.503 --> 00:02:51.366
the function at two, it
falls under this clause,

00:02:51.366 --> 00:02:53.680
but if we're approaching from the right,

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:54.766
if we're approaching from the right,

00:02:54.766 --> 00:02:56.383
those are x values greater than two,

00:02:56.383 --> 00:02:58.498
so this clause is what's at play.

00:02:58.498 --> 00:03:01.853
So we'll evaluate this clause at two.

00:03:01.853 --> 00:03:04.474
So, because it is continuous.

00:03:04.474 --> 00:03:06.823
So this is going to be two squared

00:03:06.823 --> 00:03:09.973
times the natural log of two.

00:03:09.973 --> 00:03:12.358
And so this is equal to four

00:03:12.358 --> 00:03:14.611
times the natural log of two.

00:03:14.611 --> 00:03:17.256
Four times the natural log of two.

00:03:17.256 --> 00:03:21.004
So, the right hand limit does exist.

00:03:21.004 --> 00:03:23.387
The left hand limit does exist.

00:03:23.387 --> 00:03:25.587
But the thing that might jump out at you

00:03:25.587 --> 00:03:27.874
is that these are two different values.

00:03:27.874 --> 00:03:29.934
We approach a different
value from the left

00:03:29.934 --> 00:03:31.755
as we do from the right.

00:03:31.755 --> 00:03:32.914
If you were to graph this,

00:03:32.914 --> 00:03:36.954
you would see a jump in the actual graph.

00:03:36.954 --> 00:03:41.116
You would see a discontinuity
occurring there.

00:03:41.116 --> 00:03:43.308
And so for this one in particular,

00:03:43.308 --> 00:03:46.016
you have that jump discontinuity,

00:03:46.016 --> 00:03:48.034
this limit would not exist

00:03:48.034 --> 00:03:50.255
because the left hand limit
and the right hand limit

00:03:50.255 --> 00:03:51.925
go to two different values.

00:03:51.925 --> 00:03:53.842
So this does not exist.
