00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.440
 Whether you have an IQ of 50 or 150, we all feel intelligent, after all, no doubt minds 

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:09.280
 Smart people like Einstein, Tesla or Stephen Hawking helped form 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.410
 The world we live in. Is it possible to genetically improve intelligence? 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:14.950
 Our whole type? 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:19.480
 DNA is the basic life symbol present in every living organism. This DNA consists of genes 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.819
 Which in turn consists of 4 smaller parts called nuclear bases 

00:00:23.819 --> 00:00:30.019
 Represented by the letters A, T, G and C. In humans, these rules are arranged at 3 billion pairs, which work primarily 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:34.000
 As a blueprint for everything the cells of the body need 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.230
 Literally, all you are - by the way you look and act - is defined 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.500
 By regulating these four biological compounds 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.010
 Scientists have been able to find links between the way genes are organized and some features 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.390
 Which you offer - from your sex to the color of your eyes and even diseases that may develop 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.720
 It was already a human genome project that first began analyzing and mapping all genes 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:58.579
 In the human body. The initial project took more than a decade and $ 3 billion to complete 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:02.690
 With teams all over the world working together. Today, with a much smaller team 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:07.119
 The same can be achieved in a few days ... for only $ 4000 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:12.359
 As sequenced genomes accumulate - whether they are from plants, microbes or humans 

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:16.729
 The more we compare the features we see abroad 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:21.850
 With gene combinations, we find the inside. This is exactly what he hopes 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:23.500
 Project Genome knowledge achieved 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.800
 Using more than 2,000 people with more than 150 IQ, plans to deliver 

00:01:27.889 --> 00:01:32.479
 More than 20,000 other subjects, researchers at the BGI Institute in China are looking for 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:36.979
 Basically the genetic intelligence. In other words, they scan DNA for thousands 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:40.780
 From smart people, to look for patterns you might be responsible for making smart 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:41.909
 in the first place 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.090
 Of course, this is a much more complicated task than looking for a satisfactory pattern, for example 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.569
 Tay Sachs and Huntington's disease results in one genetic mutation 

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:54.979
 They are easily identified. Hair color and eye, on the other hand, depend on multiple genes interact 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:59.229
 - However, with the correct analysis can be expected. But almost certainly personality like personality 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:03.599
 Or intelligence is the result of thousands of genes that interact in unique ways 

00:02:03.599 --> 00:02:08.050
 A pattern not yet discovered by scientists. The truth is they may not find one 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:15.450
 But what happens if they do? I mean, future children may mean genius! With the advent of in vitro fertilization 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:21.080
 You may be able to create multiple embryos and scan their DNA 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:26.130
 Scientists will then be able to identify the most likely traits in each fetus 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:31.670
 Based on their genes, allowing parents to choose the child they want 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:37.380
 For example, this fetus has a 50% chance of being an exceptional musician, or this one has a 58% chance of having more than 150 IQ 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:42.520
 In this way, the genetic information is not actually changed, but rather examined 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:46.990
 We may actually be able to increase the intelligence of future generations 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:51.100
 But what about you? Can you change your gene makeup to make you smarter and faster 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.500
 Or stronger now? 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.500
