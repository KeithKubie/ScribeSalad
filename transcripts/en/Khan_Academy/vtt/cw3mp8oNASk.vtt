00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:09.060
Let's see if we can simplify 5
times the square root of 117.

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:13.060
So 117 doesn't jump out at me as
some type of a perfect square.

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:14.990
So let's actually take
its prime factorization

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:20.130
and see if any of those prime
factors show up more than once.

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.750
So clearly it's an odd number.

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.140
It's clearly not divisible by 2.

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:25.727
To test whether
it's divisible by 3,

00:00:25.727 --> 00:00:27.060
we can add up all of the digits.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.810
And we explain why this works in
another place on Khan Academy.

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:31.860
But if you add up all
the digits, you get a 9.

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:36.225
And 9 is divisible by 3, so 117
is going to be divisible by 3.

00:00:36.225 --> 00:00:37.600
Now, let's do a
little aside here

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.340
to figure out what 117
divided by 3 actually is.

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.700
So 3 doesn't go into 1.

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.010
It does go into 11, three times.

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:47.670
3 times 3 is 9.

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.390
Subtract, you got
a remainder of 2.

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.400
Bring down a 7.

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.850
3 goes into 27 nine times.

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.087
9 times 3 is 27.

00:00:58.087 --> 00:00:59.170
Subtract, and you're done.

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.080
It goes in perfectly.

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:07.550
So we can factor
117 as 3 times 39.

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.935
Now 39, we can factor as--
that jumps out more at us

00:01:10.935 --> 00:01:13.010
that that's divisible by 3.

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.820
That's equivalent to 3 times 13.

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.320
And then all of these
are now prime numbers.

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.580
So we could say that this
thing is the same as 5 times

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:34.585
the square root of
3 times 3 times 13.

00:01:37.061 --> 00:01:39.560
And this is going to be the
same thing as-- and we know this

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.210
from our exponent
properties-- 5 times

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:54.880
the square root of 3 times 3
times the square root of 13.

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.744
Now, what's the square
root of 3 times 3?

00:01:56.744 --> 00:01:58.160
Well, that's the
square root of 9.

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:59.730
That's the square
root of 3 squared.

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:02.120
Any of those-- well, that's
just going to give you 3.

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.590
So this is just going
to simplify to 3.

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:10.470
So this whole thing is 5 times
3 times the square root of 13.

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.750
So this part right over
here would give us 15 times

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.850
the square root of 13.

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:21.750
Let's do one more example here.

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:29.896
So let's try to simplify 3
times the square root of 26.

00:02:29.896 --> 00:02:31.770
I'm actually going
to put 26 in yellow,

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.160
like I did in the
previous problem.

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.442
Well, 26 is clearly
an even number,

00:02:37.442 --> 00:02:38.900
so it's going to
be divisible by 2.

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.917
We can rewrite it as 2 times 13.

00:02:41.917 --> 00:02:42.750
And then we're done.

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:43.820
13 is a prime number.

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:45.860
We can't factor this any more.

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.204
And so 26 doesn't have
any perfect squares in it.

00:02:48.204 --> 00:02:49.620
It's not like we
can factor it out

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:50.970
as a factor of
some other numbers

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.720
and some perfect squares
like we did here.

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.430
117 is 13 times 9.

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.740
It's the product of a
perfect square and 13.

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.645
26 isn't, so we've simplified
this about as much as we can.

00:03:01.645 --> 00:03:08.138
We would just leave this as 3
times the square root of 26.
