Speaker 1:          00:04          Yeah

Speaker 2:          00:05          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:06          Like a boss.

Speaker 3:          00:08          I saw a couple, I actually saw a couple of them went out and I saw, I go, I saw that. And um, I liked it, but it was funny when Ben Affleck, they say, what's your name? And he goes, my name is Tony Mendez.

Speaker 2:          00:23          Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:26          My name is Tony Mendez. I'm from New York. My father worked construction. My mother teaches elementary school. I have one.

Speaker 3:          00:33          I remember thinking in my head going Mendez, I think that's a Latino name. I know it's not a white name. I know. I've never met anybody. I never met a white guy. Hey, what's your name? I Larry. Larry. What? Rodriguez. Larry Mendez. It's not, you know, it's not like one of those crossover names. So in the end of the movie, spoiler alert, they had, this is just shit in the credits. They just have a, you know, they have a picture of everybody, you know, each cast. Cause it was a true story. So each cast member is, um, you know, I should talk to this, I should talk to Nia about this, you know, this is, this is it. We're going to do a fucking, uh, another Neil log this week, and I'm going to talk about this because they had, you know, the six actors who are fucking unreal, who played the, uh, the people trying to get out of Iran. They showed a closeup picture of the actor right next to a closeup picture of like the photo id of the person that they were playing and it was fucking dead on. They looked exactly like the person

Speaker 2:          01:54          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          01:54          and then there's like another minute or so credits and then they finally show the real Tony Mendez. And the picture is like a full body shot of the guy from like halfway across the room shaking hands with Jimmy Carter. And you're looking at the guy and he looks like Bartolo Cologne's dad and me. And Nia just started laughing our asses off and you know, it was, it was one of those moments, one of those Hollywood moments. And then I looked on the internet and it was people complaining going, what the fuck? You know, how come you couldn't get a Latin actor to do it? But Bob [inaudible] done all that shit. You know,

Speaker 1:          02:32          now you play a character in this film by the name of Tony Mendez and a lot of your fans don't realize that you speak Spanish very well. So I have to ask you and Espanyol to own the upper in these Dale Espanol. Econdo [inaudible] [inaudible] uh, you know [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          02:55          this is what I got to say about that. I definitely think it's fucked up. Why don't I just say what I had to set about say about that? Like, like what? I was just going to present all this shit and then move on.

Speaker 3:          03:07          All right. I don't know how to say my points without having some sort of intro. And now here is what I think about that. I think it's fucked up cause it was a real dude and he's a hero. He did some unreal shit. So because it's a real dude who did some real heroic shit, you should have a Latin dude play the guy. So everybody knows that that win is in their column. You know, that's one full Latinos, you know, so the next time you get into a barroom argument, you know, well doe way Fed on the airplane and then the Latin guy could be like, yeah, well we're the ones who got those six motherfuckers on the plate and got him into Canada. Right. And all of your shit, both sides. You're in a bar, so none of your read. It's all based on the movies, but now it's going to cause a fight in a bar because some of them, yet it was a white guy. The guy's good. No, it was fucking Tony Mendez Essay his way. Fuck you. The why was it played by Ben Affleck? And then there's going to be a big fight. But on the other side is if you got a fucking million dollars and you need the movie to sell, what do you do?

Speaker 3:          04:31          I still think they should've. They should've gone. Really should've got Luis Guzman. Where the hell is he coming from this? Why is he saying this? Luis Guzman is Tony Mendez. I know. Fucking know. You know what? That's one of the ones that I got to talk to the about that shit. But it's a good movie. You should definitely go see it. But I got to tell you, that was inadvertently fucking hilarious. I'm like, me and Nia walked out and started joking about it, and by the time we got out of the movie theater, we were crying and laughing and everybody was looking at us like we were out of our minds.

Speaker 4:          05:10          And the fake movie crew Mendez was the production manager. And for the cover to work, he had to become a real one. He opened a production company in Los Angeles. He had business cards made. Mendez played his part so well that you could say at the time, he might've been the best actor in the world. And in a way, you should've won an academy award for the, for the role you played in it. Yeah, that'd be a good idea. We could have an academy awards were spies for Mendez. That's what passes it. Sarcasm.
