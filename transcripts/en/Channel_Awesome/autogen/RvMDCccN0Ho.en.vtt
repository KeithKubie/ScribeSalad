but<00:21:10.429><c> can</c><00:21:10.610><c> also</c><00:21:10.820><c> be</c><00:21:11.030><c> used</c><00:21:11.150><c> as</c><00:21:11.600><c> a</c><00:21:11.630><c> weapon</c><00:21:11.870><c> of</c>

00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:12.170 align:start position:0%
but can also be used as a weapon of
 

00:21:12.170 --> 00:21:13.540 align:start position:0%
but can also be used as a weapon of
course<00:21:12.350><c> as</c><00:21:12.590><c> why</c><00:21:12.710><c> he</c><00:21:12.800><c> wants</c><00:21:13.010><c> to</c><00:21:13.100><c> keep</c><00:21:13.220><c> it</c><00:21:13.400><c> secret</c>

00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:13.550 align:start position:0%
course as why he wants to keep it secret
 

00:21:13.550 --> 00:21:17.919 align:start position:0%
course as why he wants to keep it secret
uh<00:21:14.050><c> so</c><00:21:15.050><c> he</c><00:21:15.290><c> sort</c><00:21:15.500><c> of</c><00:21:15.530><c> shows</c><00:21:15.800><c> her</c><00:21:16.010><c> this</c><00:21:16.250><c> and</c><00:21:16.929><c> you</c>

00:21:17.919 --> 00:21:17.929 align:start position:0%
uh so he sort of shows her this and you
 

00:21:17.929 --> 00:21:19.870 align:start position:0%
uh so he sort of shows her this and you
know<00:21:18.130><c> they're</c><00:21:19.130><c> trying</c><00:21:19.340><c> to</c><00:21:19.429><c> get</c><00:21:19.550><c> the</c><00:21:19.670><c> company</c>

00:21:19.870 --> 00:21:19.880 align:start position:0%
know they're trying to get the company
 

00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:21.310 align:start position:0%

and then on top of that we don't really
know<00:21:40.580><c> if</c><00:21:40.850><c> him</c><00:21:41.210><c> and</c><00:21:41.240><c> the</c><00:21:41.840><c> Catwoman</c><00:21:42.410><c> are</c>

know if him and the Catwoman are
 

00:21:42.530 --> 00:21:47.040 align:start position:0%
know if him and the Catwoman are
supposed<00:21:42.890><c> to</c><00:21:42.950><c> be</c><00:21:43.130><c> an</c><00:21:43.400><c> item</c><00:21:44.140><c> really</c><00:21:45.140><c> I</c><00:21:45.850><c> you</c><00:21:46.850><c> know</c>

00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:47.050 align:start position:0%
supposed to be an item really I you know
 

00:21:47.050 --> 00:21:49.320 align:start position:0%
supposed to be an item really I you know
certain<00:21:48.050><c> near</c><00:21:48.200><c> the</c><00:21:48.350><c> end</c><00:21:48.590><c> you</c><00:21:48.710><c> surrogate</c><00:21:49.130><c> Oh</c>

00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:49.330 align:start position:0%
certain near the end you surrogate Oh
 

00:21:49.330 --> 00:21:52.240 align:start position:0%
certain near the end you surrogate Oh
are<00:21:50.330><c> they</c><00:21:50.720><c> I</c><00:21:51.050><c> maybe</c><00:21:51.559><c> they</c><00:21:51.890><c> are</c>

00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:52.250 align:start position:0%
are they I maybe they are
 

00:21:52.250 --> 00:21:54.340 align:start position:0%
are they I maybe they are
I<00:21:52.400><c> don't</c><00:21:52.640><c> know</c><00:21:52.760><c> but</c><00:21:52.970><c> again</c><00:21:53.090><c> it's</c><00:21:53.450><c> the</c><00:21:53.840><c> final</c>

00:21:54.340 --> 00:21:54.350 align:start position:0%
I don't know but again it's the final
 

00:21:54.350 --> 00:21:56.500 align:start position:0%
I don't know but again it's the final
film<00:21:54.620><c> so</c><00:21:55.040><c> this</c><00:21:55.190><c> is</c><00:21:55.370><c> what</c><00:21:55.580><c> they're</c><00:21:55.790><c> sticking</c>

00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:56.510 align:start position:0%
film so this is what they're sticking
 

00:21:56.510 --> 00:21:57.270 align:start position:0%
film so this is what they're sticking
with

00:21:57.270 --> 00:21:57.280 align:start position:0%
with
 

00:21:57.280 --> 00:22:01.410 align:start position:0%
with
and<00:21:58.890><c> at</c><00:21:59.890><c> the</c><00:22:00.010><c> very</c><00:22:00.040><c> end</c><00:22:00.280><c> I</c><00:22:00.520><c> guess</c><00:22:00.880><c> there's</c><00:22:01.150><c> kind</c>

00:22:01.410 --> 00:22:01.420 align:start position:0%
and at the very end I guess there's kind
 

00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:03.150 align:start position:0%
and at the very end I guess there's kind
of<00:22:01.510><c> a</c><00:22:01.600><c> clear</c><00:22:01.900><c> answer</c><00:22:02.290><c> but</c><00:22:02.320><c> it's</c><00:22:02.680><c> not</c><00:22:02.860><c> one</c><00:22:03.130><c> that</c>

00:22:03.150 --> 00:22:03.160 align:start position:0%
of a clear answer but it's not one that
 

00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:06.450 align:start position:0%
of a clear answer but it's not one that
you<00:22:03.580><c> were</c><00:22:03.730><c> like</c><00:22:03.940><c> yeah</c><00:22:04.330><c> I</c><00:22:04.560><c> see</c><00:22:05.560><c> how</c><00:22:05.800><c> they</c><00:22:06.010><c> got</c><00:22:06.220><c> to</c>

00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:19.270 align:start position:0%
my guess would be that in terms of
 

00:27:19.270 --> 00:27:20.669 align:start position:0%
my guess would be that in terms of
what's<00:27:19.450><c> gonna</c><00:27:19.570><c> be</c><00:27:19.720><c> the</c><00:27:19.840><c> big</c><00:27:19.990><c> money</c><00:27:20.200><c> maker</c><00:27:20.440><c> at</c>

00:27:20.669 --> 00:27:20.679 align:start position:0%
what's gonna be the big money maker at
 

00:27:20.679 --> 00:27:22.440 align:start position:0%

Dark Knight Rises might have the bigger
opening<00:27:22.780><c> weekend</c><00:27:23.080><c> possibly</c><00:27:23.620><c> but</c><00:27:24.220><c> I</c><00:27:24.400><c> think</c>

00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:24.610 align:start position:0%
opening weekend possibly but I think
 

00:27:24.610 --> 00:27:26.760 align:start position:0%
opening weekend possibly but I think
Avengers<00:27:25.059><c> is</c><00:27:25.450><c> the</c><00:27:25.809><c> safe</c><00:27:26.020><c> bet</c><00:27:26.260><c> for</c><00:27:26.500><c> the</c><00:27:26.559><c> one</c>

00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:26.770 align:start position:0%
Avengers is the safe bet for the one
 

00:27:26.770 --> 00:27:29.490 align:start position:0%
Avengers is the safe bet for the one
