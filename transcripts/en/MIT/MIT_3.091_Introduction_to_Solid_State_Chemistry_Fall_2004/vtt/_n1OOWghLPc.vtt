00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.330
Let's get started.
One announcement. And that is the

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:30.660
reminder about the upcoming
celebration Wednesday.

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.990
There is the coverage.
It is up here on the screen.

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:41.330
It starts midpoint Lecture 17
starting with Bragg's Law and goes

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:46.660
through to the end of November 8th,
Lecture 24, Diffusion. And that

00:00:46.660 --> 00:01:04.920
will be the coverage.
Let's get on with today's lesson.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:56.140
It is a continuation of what we
began talking about on Wednesday.

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.280
We started looking at solution
chemistry, and we recognized that

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.420
bonding was the key to understanding
why thing mix,

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.560
why things don't mix.
And, along the way, we came up with

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.710
some metrics, including the
solubility product which was

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.850
superior to simply saturation
solubility because it allowed us to

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:36.500
look at what happens when there is a
plurality of solutes.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:25.760
And we came to know the common ion
effect which in the presence of a

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:30.530
common ion we observed repressed
solubility. Today I want to talk

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:35.300
about a subset,
some specialized solution chemistry.

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:40.070
And that takes us to acids and
bases, which are pervasive.

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.840
Perhaps you got up this morning and
washed your hair with pH balanced

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.610
shampoo and treated yourself to some
orange juice with citric

00:01:49.610 --> 00:02:07.686
and ascorbic acid.
Maybe you had the radio playing

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:40.400
powered by zinc-alkaline batteries.
I started my car thanks to a lead

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:46.000
acid battery. And I had some
appliances running,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.600
electricity-generated coal fired
plant which was spewing sulfur

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:57.200
dioxide generating acid rain.
We are off to a good start. Acids

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:22.140
and bases are everywhere.
What I wanted to do today was to go

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.420
a little bit deeper into acids and
bases. And, unlike last day,

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.710
today we will have some history.
We are going to go back in time.

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:34.990
And we are going to go way, way
back because acids and bases have

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:39.280
been known into antiquity.
In fact, humans have used acids in

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.570
materials processing and in the
processing of food.

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:47.850
The whole notion of pickling
involves denaturing of protein by a

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:53.660
shift in acidity.
Acid comes from the Latin word.

00:02:53.660 --> 00:03:00.990
Acid derives from the Latin word
acidus. And acidus means sour or

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:08.330
tart. And that indeed is the taste
of acid to us.

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:15.660
And then modern chemistry,
we go to just the predawn of the

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:31.053
French Revolution to France
and Lavoisier.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:26.830
And it was Lavoisier in 1779,
you know, I am going to be talking

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:30.660
about a number of people from
different countries.

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.490
A lot of them are from Europe,
so what I thought I would do, to

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:38.330
keep everybody straight,
I would use the oval sticker you see

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:42.160
on the back of a car.
Lavoisier would have an F from

00:03:42.160 --> 00:04:02.320
France. He would be driving a
Peugeot or Renault undoubtedly.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:51.140
And Lavoisier tried to understand
acids and bases,

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:56.280
and he reasoned that oxygen was the
key, that oxygen is present in acids.

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:01.420
And we know this to be wrong now,
but he spent much of his career

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:06.560
studying combustion.
In fact, there was an intense

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.710
rivalry between Lavoisier in France,
Joseph Priestley in Great Britain

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:16.850
and Scheele in Sweden to try to
understand combustion.

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:34.766
What was it about air that sustains
combustion?

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000
And they eventually figured out that
it was a constituent of air which

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.000
they named oxygen.
And it is named oxy.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.000
This comes from the Greek which
means sharp as in tart.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.000
Oddly enough, and of course the gen
particle, you understand,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.000
is meaning to be born, or as we say
to generate and so on.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.000
Oddly enough, the name oxygen is a
complete irony.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:56.830
Because it is named by someone who
thought it was a constituent of all

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:01.660
acids. And it is not,
but the name remains. That is the

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:06.490
way things were in 1779.
And then Lavoisier subsequently

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:11.330
perished in the French Revolution.
Then we go to Britain and Sir

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:16.160
Humphrey Davy in 1810.
He would have a GB, driving

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:34.120
probably a Jaguar or maybe
an Aston-Martin.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:26.270
And he reasoned that it was hydrogen
present in all acids.

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:31.540
And that was a good insight,
and that is where it stayed. He

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:36.810
didn't talk about anything beyond
that. He didn't say what the form

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:42.080
of hydrogen was.
He simply said that it was present

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:47.360
in all acids. Then the next
milestone comes in 1887.

00:05:47.360 --> 00:06:03.753
None other than Arrhenius.
Arrhenius in 1887.

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:41.700
And he was in Sweden so he has a S.
He is probably driving a Volvo.

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:49.500
What he did is said not only is
hydrogen present in all acids,

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:57.300
but the acid dissociates in water in
order to donate protons.

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:25.090
Acid is a substance that
dissociates in water giving

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:32.660
the proton, H plus.
And he further talked about the

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:39.990
compliment of the acid which he
called the base.

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:47.330
And he defined the base as a
substance that dissociates in water

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:54.220
to give the OH minus, the hydroxyl.
We have hydroxyl ion and proton.

00:06:54.220 --> 00:07:00.660
This is what Arrhenius told us.
This was all part and parcel of his

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:07.110
major contribution that won him the
Nobel Prize, which was the theory of

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:13.550
electrolytic dissociation.
And this was really important

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:30.766
because it set the stage for
electrochemical processing.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:24.660
What he reasoned is that when you
inject charged species into water,

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:29.330
you do the same as we do when we
dope a semiconductor and we raise

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:33.990
the conductivity.
We saw evidence for that last day.

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:38.660
Let's look at two examples. This
is HCl as a gas.

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:43.330
Hydrogen chloride as a gas.
This is a polar molecule. You have

00:07:43.330 --> 00:08:01.060
done the analysis of
this many times.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:53.330
If we bubble this through water,
it will dissolve. And, according to

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:58.660
Arrhenius, dissociate to give us the
proton which is now dissolved in

00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:03.990
water denoted aq for aqueous and
chloride ion. We can see injection

00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:09.330
of charges, pluses and minuses.
And sodium hydroxide as a

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:14.660
prototypical example of a base.
It is a solid at room temperature.

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:33.786
And, if it dissolves in water, it
gives us sodium ion plus hydroxyl.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:06.000
Furthermore, Arrhenius said that
there is an overarching reaction

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:12.000
that involves reconstitution of the
solvent. Water,

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:18.000
in this case, is acting as the
solvent. We can run the reaction

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:24.000
vertically now.
We can take HCl aqueous plus NaOH

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:30.000
aqueous to give us NaCl
aqueous plus H2O.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:56.180
What we are doing is reacting the
acid with the base to get the

00:08:56.180 --> 00:09:02.360
solvent back - water - plus salt.
And this is the neutralization

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:08.540
reaction. That is to take us away
from either acidic or basic solution.

00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:14.720
Neutralization involves
recombination of the solvent.

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:20.900
Everything I am going to talk about
today is in reference to aqueous

00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:40.266
solution chemistry, acids and bases.
But these definitions of proton

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000
donor and so on apply to nonaqueous
solvents. But for 3.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000
91 we are going to stay in the
aqueous phase.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000
Now, what are the shortcomings of
Arrhenius' theory?

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.000
It was good for the late 1880s,
but shortcomings always manifest

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000
themselves through data.
And people had known for quite some

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.000
time that they could dissolve
ammonia, another molecule that we

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.900
have seen in 3.091.
They could dissolve ammonia in water.

00:09:34.900 --> 00:10:00.690
And when they dissolved ammonia in
water they found they got an aqueous

00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:06.490
solution that neutralizes acid.
Then they concluded that ammonia

00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:12.290
dissolved in water is acting as
though it is a base,

00:10:12.290 --> 00:10:18.090
but there is no hydroxyl here.
There is no oxygen so you cannot

00:10:18.090 --> 00:10:25.140
make OH minus here.
Something was incomplete.

00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:33.420
How to explain in the absence of OH
minus? Well, you had to wait until

00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:41.710
the 20th century.
And the explanation came from two

00:10:41.710 --> 00:10:56.620
places simultaneously. Bronsted,
1923 in Denmark.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:36.000
I suppose he is driving a Volvo,
too. And Lowry in the UK. Bronsted

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:42.000
and Lowry both independently in the
same year enunciated an enhanced

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:48.000
definition, a broader definition of
acid and base which is as follows.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:54.000
Acid remains the same as Arrhenius.
It is a substance that is a proton

00:10:54.000 --> 00:11:00.000
donor. That is the
same as Arrhenius.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:27.720
But then, to capture the notion that

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:33.180
an aqueous solution of ammonia can
act as a base,

00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:38.630
they define the base in terms of
something that is chemistry-free.

00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:44.080
And they said this is something
that is a proton acceptor.

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:49.540
Now, that is different. No mention
of hydroxyl. Anything that accepts

00:11:49.540 --> 00:12:08.146
proton would fall under the
definition of Bronsted-Lowry base.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:58.840
Here is the prototypical reaction.
Any substance that has a proton, I

00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:02.690
am going to write proton plus
everything else,

00:12:02.690 --> 00:12:06.530
so A represents the rest of the
chemistry of the compound where H is

00:12:06.530 --> 00:12:10.380
a hydrogen that can be dissolved in
water and liberated.

00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:14.230
This is a proton donor.
And for the rest of the lecture,

00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:18.070
instead of writing H plus, I am
going to write "p+"

00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:23.750
to indicate proton.
HA is a proton donor,

00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:31.250
and it reacts with some
Bronsted-Lowry base,

00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:38.750
which is a proton acceptor.
And when it reacts, B accepts the

00:12:38.750 --> 00:12:46.250
proton and becomes BH plus.
And HA has lost a proton, and it is

00:12:46.250 --> 00:13:03.000
now simply A minus.
If you walked in the room,

00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:37.500
and I know this never happens,
but if you had momentarily dozed off

00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:42.500
and hadn't caught the last thing
that I said, you might look at the

00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:47.500
right-hand side of the equation and
say, well, BH plus has a proton that

00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:52.500
it can give away and become naked B.
This BH plus is also a proton donor

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:57.500
and A minus, we know from looking at
the left side of the equation,

00:12:57.500 --> 00:13:03.000
is perfectly capable of bonding to H.
This A minus must be also a proton

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:09.000
acceptor. Now what do we see?
We see that the equation comes in

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:15.000
conjunction. That B and BH plus are
donor and acceptor,

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:21.000
and they are associated with one
another so I am going to denote that,

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:27.000
that B and BH plus are associated
with one another and HA and A minus

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:52.540
are associated with one another.
And we call such pairs conjugate

00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:57.630
pairs. These are conjugate pairs.
Con is the Latin for with and

00:13:57.630 --> 00:14:02.720
jugara is the Latin for to marry and
is also the same word for yoke.

00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:07.810
I think if you pronounce the j as a
y, you can see how you get yoke in

00:14:07.810 --> 00:14:12.900
modern English.
And, in fact, I will designate

00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:32.000
these with yoke to show that they
are conjugate acid-base pairs.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:22.570
And just to be clear about
definitions, let's look.

00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:27.140
HA, this is a proton donor,
so this is both a Bronsted-Lowry

00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:31.710
acid and it is also an Arrhenius
acid. It conforms to the old

00:14:31.710 --> 00:14:36.280
definition of Arrhenius.
Now, this is a proton acceptor B.

00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:40.850
Therefore, it is a Bronsted-Lowry
base. But it is not an Arrhenius

00:14:40.850 --> 00:14:45.420
base because it has no hydroxyl.
You can see this is a case of in

00:14:45.420 --> 00:15:04.440
some cases there is an overlap and
others there is not.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:54.460
These are both Bronsted-Lowry.
This is Bronsted-Lowry acid. This

00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:58.920
would be an Arrhenius acid because
it has a proton.

00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:03.380
It can give away a proton.
This is both a Bronsted-Lowry acid

00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:07.840
and an Arrhenius acid.
And this one here, of course,

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:12.300
is simply a Bronsted-Lowry base.
It is not an Arrhenius base because

00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:16.760
it has no proton.
You can see there is a nice

00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:22.290
contrast between the two.
That means, in the light of Bronsted

00:15:22.290 --> 00:15:28.890
and Lowry, we view acid-base
reactions are,

00:15:28.890 --> 00:15:35.490
in fact, proton transfer reactions.
Follow the proton - that is the

00:15:35.490 --> 00:15:42.090
message here. Follow the proton.
In fact, the proton is the bearer

00:15:42.090 --> 00:15:48.690
of acidity. Follow the bouncing
ball. Follow the bouncing proton,

00:15:48.690 --> 00:15:54.660
which is the bearer of acidity.
Where the proton goes that is where

00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:59.990
the acid is. Now let's go back to
ammonia and see if we have solved

00:15:59.990 --> 00:16:05.330
the problem. Now I will write the
ammonia reaction.

00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:10.660
NH3, which is now dissolved in
water, is now aqueous,

00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:29.053
plus water, H2O. What ammonia can
do is neutralize water.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:21.140
What it does is neutralizes water,
not by donating hydroxyls but by

00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:26.280
drawing up, taking out of
circulation protons.

00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:31.420
Because acid and base is really a
ratio. Acid has an excess of

00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:36.560
protons. If I want to get rid of
the acid, I can either flood it with

00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:41.710
base or somehow get a vacuum in
there and draw up all the protons.

00:16:41.710 --> 00:16:46.850
That is what ammonia is doing. And
leaving behind hydroxyl.

00:16:46.850 --> 00:17:04.100
It is generating hydroxyl
indirectly.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:57.590
And so let's call these what they
are. This is a proton acceptor.

00:16:57.590 --> 00:17:03.190
And here is its conjugate acid.
This is obviously a proton donor.

00:17:03.190 --> 00:17:08.790
And, if we come up with a new,
improved theory and we do not

00:17:08.790 --> 00:17:14.390
declare hydroxyl a base,
we failed. We better make sure that

00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:33.313
is the case. And this indeed is a
proton acceptor. And leaving water.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:25.450
Water is acting as a proton donor.
Pure water acting opposite ammonia

00:17:25.450 --> 00:17:30.900
is acting as an acid here.
This is Bronsted-Lowry base.

00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:36.360
We solved the thorny problem of the
observation that ammonia has the

00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:41.810
capacity to neutralize some
solutions, and this water is acting

00:17:41.810 --> 00:17:47.270
as a Bronsted-Lowry acid.
And then you see the conjugate acid

00:17:47.270 --> 00:18:05.573
and base pairs as follows.
Here water and hydroxyl are

00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:37.500
conjugates, and ammonia and this ion
here which is called ammonium.

00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:42.500
Ammonium is one of the few
polyatomic ions that is positive.

00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:47.500
Most of the polyatomic ions, things
like carbonate,

00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:52.500
sulfate and phosphate are negative.
But this is one of the few that is

00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:57.500
positive. I think we should have
special respect for ammonium,

00:17:57.500 --> 00:18:22.300
for its rarity. It is a rara avis.
It is a rare bird.

00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:26.920
Now let's go into the chemistry.
How do we identify substances that

00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:31.530
are going to act as Bronsted-Lowry
bases? Whenever I ask you how,

00:18:31.530 --> 00:18:36.150
that is your queen of diamonds.
What do you do?

00:18:36.150 --> 00:18:40.760
He said how, I go let's look at
electronic structure.

00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:45.380
I am going to look at electronic
structure of ammonia and of proton,

00:18:45.380 --> 00:19:04.360
because ammonia is a proton acceptor.
Let's look at it.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:54.130
Here is proton.
Actually, I said I was going to

00:18:54.130 --> 00:18:58.260
write it only as P plus,
but I am going to do it this one

00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:02.390
last time. What is the Lewis
structure of this?

00:19:02.390 --> 00:19:06.530
Where are the electrons?
There are none. This brings

00:19:06.530 --> 00:19:10.660
nothing. This is proton,
and proton contributes nothing when

00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:14.790
it enters into bonds.
It is like a needy friend.

00:19:14.790 --> 00:19:18.930
It just takes. It does not give.
It takes your time, drains your

00:19:18.930 --> 00:19:23.530
emotional energy.
That is proton.

00:19:23.530 --> 00:19:28.610
We all have protons in our lives,
I am sure. And I am not just

00:19:28.610 --> 00:19:33.690
talking about the orange juice.
Now let's look at ammonia. Ammonia

00:19:33.690 --> 00:19:38.760
is NH3. Nitrogen has five valence
electrons. Three of them are shared

00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:43.840
with the three hydrogens.
And there are two valence electrons

00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:48.920
sitting up here in their own orbital.
And, in the past,

00:19:48.920 --> 00:20:08.373
we were circling these in blue and
calling them nonbonding electrons.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:58.760
This is a nonbonding pair.
Well, guess what happens? You have

00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:03.530
a situation where the proton has no
electrons, and it wants to glom onto

00:20:03.530 --> 00:20:08.300
something that will be the base
because it is a proton acceptor.

00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:13.070
The only thing that can accept
protons must come up with both

00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:17.840
electrons. It is axiomatic.
The only substances that could

00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:22.610
possibly act as Bronsted-Lowry bases
must be substances endowed with lone

00:20:22.610 --> 00:20:28.250
pairs or nonbonding electrons.
To find Bronsted-Lowry bases look

00:20:28.250 --> 00:20:34.750
for nonbonding pairs.
All you need is one. Let's look at

00:20:34.750 --> 00:20:41.250
some other substances that could do
this. How about water?

00:20:41.250 --> 00:20:47.750
What about water? Well,
we could do the Lewis structure of

00:20:47.750 --> 00:21:04.566
water, H-O-H.
Oxygen has six valence electrons.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:40.000
Two are in the orbitals sharing
with hydrogen leaving us with not

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:46.000
one but two nonbonding pairs.
We know that this tells us that

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:52.000
water could possibly act as a
Bronsted-Lowry base.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:58.000
And what is the conjugate acid?
If this is not Bronsted-Lowry base,

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:23.790
it allows a proton to attach here.
That means we are going to have

00:21:23.790 --> 00:21:29.390
three hydrogens here.
And the conjugate base is shown as

00:21:29.390 --> 00:21:34.990
follows. It is going to be H-H-H.
And then the last nonbonding pair.

00:21:34.990 --> 00:21:40.590
And this has the chemical formula
of H3O plus and has the name

00:21:40.590 --> 00:21:46.190
hydronium. Hydronium is the
conjugate acid to water which is

00:21:46.190 --> 00:21:51.210
acting as a Bronsted-Lowry base.
We can write the reaction and show

00:21:51.210 --> 00:21:55.640
that water is very versatile.
I am going to take water and react

00:21:55.640 --> 00:22:00.070
it with water.
Water plus water,

00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:04.490
if I wanted to just waste your time,
I would write 2H2O on the right-hand

00:22:04.490 --> 00:22:08.920
side and leave the auditorium,
but I decided I want to keep my job.

00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:13.350
And so what I am going to do
instead is write H3O plus to give

00:22:13.350 --> 00:22:17.780
you the conjugate acid leaving
behind OH minus as the

00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:22.460
conjugate base.
This is acid here and this is base.

00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:27.390
I am looking at the two waters. I
am just designating them arbitrarily.

00:22:27.390 --> 00:22:32.330
Let's make this acid.
And, of course, hydroxyl must be a

00:22:32.330 --> 00:22:37.260
base. And then we can group them in
conjugate pairs.

00:22:37.260 --> 00:22:42.190
H2O is a conjugate to hydronium and
H2O is a conjugate to hydroxyl.

00:22:42.190 --> 00:22:47.130
We have the two conjugate pairs
here. And we say that such

00:22:47.130 --> 00:22:52.060
substances that can be both proton
donors and proton acceptors have

00:22:52.060 --> 00:23:09.586
this dual nature associated
with them.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:23:02.110
And we call these amphiprotic.
They behave in two ways with

00:23:02.110 --> 00:23:07.220
respect to proton.
It is sort of like amphitheater.

00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:12.330
If you are looking top down, a
Roman theater looks like this.

00:23:12.330 --> 00:23:17.440
Here is the stage and here are all
the terraces, the screaming people

00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:22.460
and everything else.
What you can do is take two theaters

00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:27.380
and put them together.
Now you have theater in the round.

00:23:27.380 --> 00:23:32.300
That is an amphitheater. This is
amphiprotic because now you can look

00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:37.220
at the stage from both sides and
scream. It turns out that both

00:23:37.220 --> 00:23:42.150
hydronium and hydroxyl are very
strong. They have a very high

00:23:42.150 --> 00:23:47.070
chemical potential.
That means it does not take much of

00:23:47.070 --> 00:24:06.206
them to express themselves.
Both have high chemical potential.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:56.280
And this chemical potential is
analogous to gravitational potential.

00:23:56.280 --> 00:24:00.560
The higher the chemical potential
the greater the chemical reactivity,

00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:04.850
the greater the chemical power.
They have a very high chemical

00:24:04.850 --> 00:24:09.140
potential, certainly much greater
than that of pure water.

00:24:09.140 --> 00:24:13.420
Pure water is relatively stable and
calm, and so it takes very little

00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:17.710
for them to express themselves.
And it turns out that the extent of

00:24:17.710 --> 00:24:37.153
that reaction that I have written is
really very minimal.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:27.230
And at 25 degrees C you expect that
reaction to give about one part in

00:24:27.230 --> 00:24:32.460
ten million. The degree of
dissociation of water is about ten

00:24:32.460 --> 00:24:37.690
to the minus seven.
And, obviously from the

00:24:37.690 --> 00:24:42.920
stoichiometry,
whenever water dissociates you get

00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:48.150
equal numbers of hydronium and
hydroxyl. And this reaction in

00:24:48.150 --> 00:24:53.380
which water decomposes,
dissociates is called the

00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:58.660
self-dissociation reaction.
Or some people also refer to it as

00:24:58.660 --> 00:25:03.990
self-ionization.
We start with neutral water,

00:25:03.990 --> 00:25:09.330
it dissociates and we get the
hydronium and the hydroxyl.

00:25:09.330 --> 00:25:14.660
And we know that pure water is a
very poor conductor.

00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:32.586
In fact, it is an insulator.
We saw that last day.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:24.280
And this is proof of it.
Even though we have carriers here,

00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:28.560
these are both charge carriers, we
have so few of them that it does not

00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:32.850
do much to give us electrical
conductivity. Analogous to a

00:25:32.850 --> 00:25:37.140
solubility product,
we can write a constant called Kw,

00:25:37.140 --> 00:25:41.420
which is analogous to a solubility
product. And it is the water

00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:45.710
dissociation product.
And it is simply the product of the

00:25:45.710 --> 00:26:05.953
concentration of hydronium ion and
the concentration of hydroxyl ion.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:53.850
And why are we doing this?
Because we saw last day that if we

00:25:53.850 --> 00:25:57.710
express solubility by a single
number that would only work in

00:25:57.710 --> 00:26:01.560
one-solute solutions.
If we use the solubility product,

00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:05.420
we could answer questions what
happens when there is a second

00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:09.280
solute coming in with a common ion.
The same thing here. If all you

00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:13.140
have is pure water,
I could just tell you that the

00:26:13.140 --> 00:26:33.346
dissociation constant is ten to the
minus seven, end of story.

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:21.920
But if I use this product and then
throw in a second source of acid,

00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:26.840
this product will remain the same,
but the hydroxyl will move up and

00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:31.760
down. This is setting the stage for
acid-base equilibria.

00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:36.690
And, before I draw the double line,
let me point out that this is a

00:26:36.690 --> 00:26:41.610
vanishingly small number.
It is the square of ten to the

00:26:41.610 --> 00:26:46.530
minus seven. It is ten to the minus
fourteen at room temperature.

00:26:46.530 --> 00:26:50.930
These are pitifully small numbers.
We can see that if we add another

00:26:50.930 --> 00:26:54.810
source of acid then the proton level
will go down and we end up with

00:26:54.810 --> 00:26:58.680
something that is acidic or vice
versa. We can then define an acidic

00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:02.550
solution as one that is out of
equilibrium with it.

00:27:02.550 --> 00:27:06.430
This is a neutral solution.
I started with pure water. It is

00:27:06.430 --> 00:27:10.300
self-dissociated.
An acidic solution has another

00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:14.180
source of proton.
In that case, the concentration of

00:27:14.180 --> 00:27:18.060
hydronium ion exceeds the
concentration of hydroxyl ion

00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:37.686
because of another source.
This is not from self-dissociation.

00:27:02.500 --> 00:27:07.500
Not self-dissociation. Not
self-ionization.

00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:12.500
We have some other source.
And the alternative is the basic

00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:17.500
solution. And,
in that case, the concentration of

00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:22.500
hydronium is less than the
concentration of hydroxyl.

00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:27.500
Again, not in self-dissociation.
We have to have some other donor

00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:52.140
here.
The acidic solution is proton-rich.

00:27:52.140 --> 00:27:56.420
Whereas, the basic solution is
proton deficient.

00:27:56.420 --> 00:28:00.710
How do we maintain charge
neutrality? Well,

00:28:00.710 --> 00:28:04.990
we can put in some other negative.
We can put in some anion. We can

00:28:04.990 --> 00:28:09.280
maintain charge neutrality in other
ways. By the way,

00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:13.570
sometimes we call this alkaline
solutions, basic.

00:28:13.570 --> 00:28:17.850
We do not call it the zinc basic
battery. We call it the

00:28:17.850 --> 00:28:22.530
zinc alkaline battery.
And that comes from Arabic al qaly

00:28:22.530 --> 00:28:27.610
which goes back to about the 10th
century where there was a

00:28:27.610 --> 00:28:32.690
recognition that if you took the
calcined ashes of certain plants and

00:28:32.690 --> 00:28:37.760
dissolved them in water they made
this tart solution that we now know

00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:42.840
to be the same as an alkaline
solution giving us the higher.

00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:47.920
We can also call it alkaline. That
is the same thing.

00:28:47.920 --> 00:29:05.840
Now what we can do is look at how
this varies.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:37.000
I draw your attention to the trace
here. This is simply the plot of

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:41.000
this equilibrium.
All I am doing is plotting the Kw

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:45.000
at 25 degrees C.
And what you see is that exactly

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:49.000
when we have a neutral solution,
the concentration of proton equals

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:53.000
the concentration of hydroxyl.
They are both at ten to the minus

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:57.000
seven. If we end up with something
that has an excess of proton then

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:01.000
necessarily if the product is
constant, if proton number goes up

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:05.000
hydroxyl number goes down,
and vice versa.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:09.500
This is how this system operates.
And I don't like this one because

00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:14.000
it is nonlinear,
and I really don't like nonlinearity

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:18.500
because we basically have this.
I cannot do anything but eyeball it.

00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:23.000
It is xy equals constant.
It is a rectangular hyperbola.

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:27.500
No good. What I would like to do
is use some kind of transformation

00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:32.000
and convert this into
a straight line.

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:56.570
I would like to have some kind of f
of x and a g of y.

00:29:56.570 --> 00:30:01.140
And, doing so, I would end up with
something that is a straight line.

00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:05.710
And that offers me two advantages.
First of all, I can take a look at

00:30:05.710 --> 00:30:10.280
some data set and look at,
with the naked eye, goodness of fit

00:30:10.280 --> 00:30:14.850
to see if my system is behaving,
if my data are good. And the second

00:30:14.850 --> 00:30:19.420
thing is if I understand how to
construct the transformation,

00:30:19.420 --> 00:30:38.240
this may give me clues as to the
underlying science.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:29.800
That is why we try to get away from
these nonlinear representations and

00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:35.600
do something that is linear.
And for that we go to Denmark,

00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:41.400
1909, a young biochemist by the name
of Sorensen. In keeping with our

00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:59.800
tradition today he gets the Denmark
sticker. He was a biochemist

00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:33.000
working at the Carlsberg
Brewery in Copenhagen.

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:37.500
Carlsberg Brewery had a research
biochemist working.

00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:42.000
Why? When you are brewing beer,
you want to control the acidity of

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:46.500
the mash in order to make sure that
your brewing is on chemical target.

00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:51.000
What he did, being a good chemist,
was looked at the situation and said

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:55.500
I do not like this nonlinearity.
He said I am going to, if you will

00:30:55.500 --> 00:31:00.000
pardon the pun, straighten
things out.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:27.250
And so what he did was say I am
going to define a quantity that will

00:31:27.250 --> 00:31:44.666
represent the chemical potential of
hydrogen, the chemical potential of

00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:41.750
let's say hydronium.
He used the symbol lowercase p and

00:31:41.750 --> 00:31:58.166
the uppercase H for the chemical
potential of hydronium.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:53.760
And he defined this in a logarithmic
fashion. It is log base ten of the

00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:58.530
hydronium concentration.
Furthermore, being practical,

00:31:58.530 --> 00:32:03.300
he recognized that these are always
numbers less than one.

00:32:03.300 --> 00:32:08.070
The log of a number less than one
is a negative number.

00:32:08.070 --> 00:32:12.840
Who wants to drag negative numbers
around? He defined it with a minus

00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:17.610
sign in front of it so that a ten to
the minus seven concentration

00:32:17.610 --> 00:32:35.686
becomes a pH plus seven.
And he furthermore defined a

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:09.000
chemical potential of hydronium ion,
pOH as minus log base ten of the

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:15.000
concentration of hydroxyl.
If you take this and put this to

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:21.000
the plot you will see the following.
You end up now with a straight line.

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:27.000
We have accomplished our mission of
getting something that allows us

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:52.350
easily to determine goodness of fit.
And the second thing is look at the

00:32:52.350 --> 00:32:57.070
range. We move here from ten to the
fourteen down to one.

00:32:57.070 --> 00:33:01.780
Whereas, on this plot,
we started at ten to the minus seven

00:33:01.780 --> 00:33:06.490
and move barely a decade.
By linearizing on a log-log plot,

00:33:06.490 --> 00:33:11.210
we have a much, much greater range
of chemistry to express.

00:33:11.210 --> 00:33:15.920
And so now we talk about acid,
which is something that has low pH

00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:20.640
because the pH is defined as minus
the log of the hydrogen

00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:38.746
ion concentration.
Proton rich is low pH and the base

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:12.000
is something that is high pH,
according to this definition. And

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:18.000
now we have, instead of that xy
equals constant,

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:24.000
we have x plus y equals constant.
And this is now very, very nice to

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:30.000
master, where this is the pH and the
ordinate is the pOH.

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:34.000
Let's look at some values,
put some values on it. Here are

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:38.000
some common substances.
We have here water in the center,

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:42.000
milk, blood. These are very nearly
neutral, mildly acidic and mildly

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:46.000
alkaline. If you drank coffee this
morning, you drank something that

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:50.000
was more acidic.
Tomato is more acidic.

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:54.000
I know you don't know anything
about this, but you have probably

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:58.000
read in the newspapers or in
magazines people describing wines as

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:22.140
being mildly acidic and so on.
And indeed the pH is down here.

00:34:22.140 --> 00:34:26.420
If the wine spoils it becomes sour
wine, vin aigre.

00:34:26.420 --> 00:34:30.710
Aigre, it means eager,
but the Medieval meaning of eager

00:34:30.710 --> 00:34:34.990
was something that was rather fresh,
rather impetuous, tart. This is

00:34:34.990 --> 00:34:39.280
vinegar. Colas are down here thanks
to benzoic and phosphoric acid.

00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:43.570
Lemon juice is here. If you drink
a lot of Coke or Pepsi,

00:34:43.570 --> 00:34:47.850
you are coming in at about pH 3,
but your stomach is down around pH 1.

00:34:47.850 --> 00:34:52.300
.
Some of us just cannot take a lot of

00:34:52.300 --> 00:34:56.920
acidic media because they just drive
our pH even lower because we keep

00:34:56.920 --> 00:35:01.530
contributing more and more protons.
And, if our stomach wall is not up

00:35:01.530 --> 00:35:06.150
to it, it will get ulcerated.
What do we do? We shift the pH

00:35:06.150 --> 00:35:10.760
back. How do we shift the pH back?
We introduce something that is a

00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:15.380
proton acceptor,
a vacuum cleaner for the protons.

00:35:15.380 --> 00:35:34.760
And so the classical formula is
something in the liquid form.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:24.280
It is the suspension Milk of
Magnesia or in the tablet form

00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:28.570
things like Rolaids,
Tums and so on. All they are doing

00:35:28.570 --> 00:35:32.850
is contributing proton acceptors and
driving the pH in the positive

00:35:32.850 --> 00:35:37.140
direction. I suppose if you were
really aggressive you could try

00:35:37.140 --> 00:35:41.420
household ammonia,
but I would counsel against it.

00:35:41.420 --> 00:35:45.710
Be patient. I counsel against
doing that. And this gives you some

00:35:45.710 --> 00:36:04.086
sense of scale. Now we
know what we have.

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:54.610
So far we have been assuming if I
introduce an acid it dissociates and

00:35:54.610 --> 00:35:59.220
I get protons.
All acids are not created equal.

00:35:59.220 --> 00:36:03.840
Some are strong and some are weak.
And what do we mean by that? Let's

00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:08.460
first of all look at the strong acid.
If I have a solution of one molar

00:36:08.460 --> 00:36:13.070
HCl, hydrochloric acid,
I can assume that this dissociates

00:36:13.070 --> 00:36:17.690
fully to give me one molar hydronium.
The concentration of

00:36:17.690 --> 00:36:23.660
hydronium is exactly.
I get total dissociation.

00:36:23.660 --> 00:36:30.990
But that is not always the case.
We can look at something that is a

00:36:30.990 --> 00:36:38.330
little bit weaker.
I am going to look at acetic acid.

00:36:38.330 --> 00:36:45.660
This is the constituent of vinegar.
Its formula is given as follows,

00:36:45.660 --> 00:37:02.186
CH3COOH. This frontal part is
acetate and then plus proton.

00:36:33.000 --> 00:37:00.250
I want to break this into two steps.
First of all we have, if you like,

00:37:00.250 --> 00:37:16.733
an acetate, hydrogen acetate.
And then what we will do is

00:36:47.500 --> 00:37:14.750
dissolve it in water to get CH3COOH.
And I am just going to write aq.

00:37:14.750 --> 00:37:30.833
All I have done is dissolved the
compound in water.

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:09.000
And now what I want to do is look at
its extent of dissociation.

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:16.000
Let's just call this dissolution.
All things that dissolve do not

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:23.000
necessarily dissociate fully.
Let's look at its now dissociation

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:30.000
reaction. For that we write CH3COOH
which is now in solution plus water.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:56.660
And water is going to contribute in
the following.

00:37:56.660 --> 00:38:03.330
We have H3O plus.
It makes the hydronium ion and then

00:38:03.330 --> 00:38:09.990
leaves behind the acetate ion.
Now, compare. In one molar HCl,

00:38:09.990 --> 00:38:16.660
we have one molar hydronium. In one
molar acetic acid,

00:38:16.660 --> 00:38:23.750
we have only about a half a percent.
0.4% reacts to give H3O plus and the

00:38:23.750 --> 00:38:31.250
acetate ion. If we write then an
acid dissociation constant,

00:38:31.250 --> 00:38:38.750
it is going to be the product of
hydronium and acetate over water,

00:38:38.750 --> 00:38:46.250
we will end up with hydronium times
acetate divided by the

00:38:46.250 --> 00:38:52.900
undissociated acid.
And, in this case,

00:38:52.900 --> 00:38:58.700
the number is ten to the minus five.
There is very little dissociation.

00:38:58.700 --> 00:39:04.490
Ten to the minus five is down around
ten to the minus seven which was

00:39:04.490 --> 00:39:10.290
self-ionization of water.
This is a very weak acid.

00:39:10.290 --> 00:39:16.090
This is a very weak poor proton
donor. It is a poor proton donor.

00:39:16.090 --> 00:39:21.380
What am I showing?
I am showing that it dissolves but

00:39:21.380 --> 00:39:26.150
it does not dissociate.
What we need, in order to have full

00:39:26.150 --> 00:39:30.920
acidity, is to have not only the
substance dissolve but it has to

00:39:30.920 --> 00:39:35.690
dissociate to give us protons.
This we call a weak acid. And we

00:39:35.690 --> 00:39:40.450
see we have a very low value of the
Ka which is termed the acid

00:39:40.450 --> 00:39:45.220
dissociation constant.
And it is analogous to the

00:39:45.220 --> 00:40:03.040
solubility product that
we met last day.

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:55.800
Acid dissociation constant for HCl,
just for reference, Ka for HCl is

00:39:55.800 --> 00:40:01.590
equal to the proton concentration
times the chloride ion concentration

00:40:01.590 --> 00:40:07.390
over the dissolved but undissociated
HCl. There is almost none of this.

00:40:07.390 --> 00:40:13.190
All the HCl virtually dissociates.
And this number is ten to the plus

00:40:13.190 --> 00:40:31.246
six. There is a ratio of ten to the
eleventh. Look at this.

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:05.000
This is ten to the minus five.
This is ten to the plus six. It is

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:11.000
ratio of ten to the eleven.
In six molar HCl we have 99.

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:17.000
6% dissociation, conversion to H3O
plus. We call this a very,

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:23.000
very strong acid, and this is a weak
acid. Strong acids,

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:29.000
Ka is greater than one.
And in weak acids, Ka is less than

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:34.000
one.
And then you have these moderate

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:38.000
acids right around the middle.
And I have some charts here to

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:42.000
illustrate this.
This is a very primitive graphic to

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:46.000
show that in the case of a strong
acid, you get 100% dissociation.

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:50.000
All of the H becomes H3O plus. In
a weak acid, you only get partial

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:54.000
dissociation. You still have a lot
of this undissociated neutral stuff,

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:58.000
which is not active. There is no
proton. There is no acidity.

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:02.000
And then a very weak acid
essentially does not dissociate.

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:25.850
It goes in a solution and you have a
molecular liquid.

00:41:25.850 --> 00:41:29.710
There are no protons.
And so no protons, this is a poor

00:41:29.710 --> 00:41:33.560
conductor of electricity.
Conductivity will allow you to

00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:37.420
track the amount of dissociation.
This is taken from your reading.

00:41:37.420 --> 00:41:41.280
This is Table 11.
. You can see the acid dissociation

00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:45.140
constants. There is HCl at ten to
the plus six. HBr.

00:41:45.140 --> 00:42:05.613
HI. There is HF. Hydrofluoric
acid is actually a mildly weak acid.

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:53.710
And then down here you have citric
and so on. There is carbonic which

00:41:53.710 --> 00:41:58.420
is the seltzer and so on.
This is an interesting one.

00:41:58.420 --> 00:42:03.140
Why hydroiodic acid is even
stronger than hydrochloric acid is

00:42:03.140 --> 00:42:07.850
because you have here a stronger
bond strength.

00:42:07.850 --> 00:42:12.570
Fluorine is smaller,
it pulls proton in tighter,

00:42:12.570 --> 00:42:17.280
and so the degree of dissociation is
not as great as it is here.

00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:36.226
These end up scaling as the acid
dissociation constants.

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:28.190
In general, equal acid strength does
not mean equal concentration.

00:42:28.190 --> 00:42:34.390
Now let's go to the last definition.
Also 1923, but we are going

00:42:34.390 --> 00:42:40.590
stateside now.
We are going to the United States.

00:42:40.590 --> 00:42:46.790
1923, G.N. Lewis, the same person
that gave us the Lewis Structure

00:42:46.790 --> 00:43:04.980
Notation. We will put USA on the
back of his undoubtedly Chevrolet.

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:57.900
He gave a definition that goes way
beyond Bronsted and Lowry and is

00:42:57.900 --> 00:43:02.810
free of all constraints of
composition. He said if you

00:43:02.810 --> 00:43:07.720
recognize that what you are looking
for is something with a nonbonding

00:43:07.720 --> 00:43:12.630
pair then let's talk about a base as
something that has the nonbonding

00:43:12.630 --> 00:43:17.540
pair. That is to say,
in the past we said it was a proton

00:43:17.540 --> 00:43:22.630
acceptor.
But why don't we look at the

00:43:22.630 --> 00:43:27.900
nonbonding pair.
Remember how I gave you that

00:43:27.900 --> 00:43:33.180
analogy with the traffic?
Don't look at the car, look at the

00:43:33.180 --> 00:43:38.450
car vacancy. Instead,
don't look at the proton,

00:43:38.450 --> 00:43:43.720
look at the nonbonding electrons.
What we had before is we said that

00:43:43.720 --> 00:44:01.440
the Bronsted-Lowry base
had a nonbonding pair.

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:53.390
What Lewis says is don't talk about
this as a proton acceptor,

00:43:53.390 --> 00:43:57.790
let's talk about this as an electron
pair donor. He is following the

00:43:57.790 --> 00:44:02.190
vacancy instead of the car.
Anything that is an electron pair

00:44:02.190 --> 00:44:06.590
donor he is going to call a base.
And then he is going to call what

00:44:06.590 --> 00:44:10.990
is the mate to this?
It does not have to be a proton.

00:44:10.990 --> 00:44:15.390
It could be anything that is a
capable of accepting electrons,

00:44:15.390 --> 00:44:19.790
so I am going to call that a hollow
orbital. My acid is anything that

00:44:19.790 --> 00:44:24.150
is an electron pair acceptor.
And now look at this.

00:44:24.150 --> 00:44:28.460
This is the highest
conceptualization.

00:44:28.460 --> 00:44:32.760
My neutralization reaction,
acid plus base gives solvent.

00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:37.070
Electron pair nonbonding. Empty
orbital. What happens if I take an

00:44:37.070 --> 00:44:41.380
electron pair nonbonding and mate it
with an empty orbital?

00:44:41.380 --> 00:44:45.690
What do I form? A bond.
This is very, very high level.

00:44:45.690 --> 00:45:04.113
It is gorgeous. It is absolutely
gorgeous.

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:36.000
And it is not restricted to aqueous
solutions. This is Darwin.

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:42.000
He is rising out of the water.
He can talk about gas reactions,

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:48.000
about solid state reactions. This
is free of all constraints.

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:54.000
This is electron pair plus empty
orbital gives bond.

00:44:54.000 --> 00:45:00.000
All dative chemistry,
all dative bonds are captured here.

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:25.360
This is huge.
Let's take a look at an example

00:45:25.360 --> 00:45:30.080
where that would come into play and
we will wrap into some environmental

00:45:30.080 --> 00:45:34.810
stuff as well.
I mentioned earlier about burning

00:45:34.810 --> 00:45:39.540
coal. In the United States,
about 50% of our electrical energy

00:45:39.540 --> 00:45:44.270
is generated in coal fired power
plants, 17% natural gas,

00:45:44.270 --> 00:46:03.740
3% petroleum. There is very little
that is non-carbon right now.

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:52.870
And industrial coal contains sulfur
at the ratio of about 1%.

00:45:52.870 --> 00:45:56.740
It is an impurity in coal.
And one ton of coal will burn to

00:45:56.740 --> 00:46:00.620
give you about 25 million British
thermal units or 2.

00:46:00.620 --> 00:46:04.490
times ten to the tenth joules of
energy. Here is a nice figure to

00:46:04.490 --> 00:46:08.370
remember. Three tons of coal gives
you one megawatt day.

00:46:08.370 --> 00:46:12.240
A megawatt is a power unit.
You take power times time and you

00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:16.120
have energy. If you generate one
megawatt for 24 hours that is an

00:46:16.120 --> 00:46:34.906
energy unit. You need
three tons of coal.

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:24.260
And, just for comparison,
you would need one gram of uranium.

00:46:24.260 --> 00:46:28.530
Think three tons coal, one gram
uranium. You make policy.

00:46:28.530 --> 00:46:32.790
A ten megawatt plant burns about 30
tons of coal a day,

00:46:32.790 --> 00:46:37.060
given that ratio, generating a third
of a ton of sulfur which makes

00:46:37.060 --> 00:46:41.330
two-thirds of a ton of SO2 because
it goes up the stack and burns.

00:46:41.330 --> 00:46:45.590
We can reduce sulfur dioxide
emissions. Why do we care?

00:46:45.590 --> 00:46:49.860
Because sulfur dioxide eventually
becomes H2SO4. This is a

00:46:49.860 --> 00:47:09.186
precursor to acid rain.
What we can do is trap sulfur

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:38.000
dioxide on lime,
CaO, to form calcium sulfite.

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:42.000
I am going to do that thanks to G.
. Lewis. Here is the reaction.

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:46.000
Here is sulfur dioxide.
It is sulfur with two oxygens.

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:50.000
This is a double bond and a single
bond, so this is resonant.

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:54.000
Each of these bonds is really about
one and a half order.

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:58.000
And calcium oxide, as you know,
is an ionic oxide. It is calcium

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:02.500
cation and oxide anion.
Oxide anion has nonbonding pairs to

00:47:02.500 --> 00:47:07.500
beat the band.
How many are nonbonding pairs?

00:47:07.500 --> 00:47:12.500
Four. What it can do is it can
sidle up next to the SO2,

00:47:12.500 --> 00:47:17.500
if SO2 is made to pass over a bed of
lime. And here is what happens.

00:47:17.500 --> 00:47:22.500
One of these electron pairs is
donated to the sulfur which then

00:47:22.500 --> 00:47:27.500
breaks this double and forms three
bonds. Why does it

00:47:27.500 --> 00:47:52.300
form three bonds?
Because three bonds is stabler than

00:47:52.300 --> 00:47:56.920
two bonds. Thanks to this,
we have calcium oxide acting as a

00:47:56.920 --> 00:48:01.530
Lewis base. Actually,
the O double minus is a Lewis base,

00:48:01.530 --> 00:48:06.150
according to this definition. Base
is an electron pair donor.

00:48:06.150 --> 00:48:10.760
SO2 is a Lewis acid. It better be.
You know SO2 leads to H2SO4. That

00:48:10.760 --> 00:48:15.380
is acidic. If I have a new
definition that tells me that it is

00:48:15.380 --> 00:48:33.693
basic, I don't like that.
This is consistent.

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:04.500
SO2 is a Lewis acid.
It accepts the electron pair.

00:48:04.500 --> 00:48:09.000
And, instead of having a fugitive
SO2, it is now a solid calcium

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:13.500
sulfite, the volume is dramatically
reduced and now we can safely

00:48:13.500 --> 00:48:18.000
dispose of the calcium sulfite and
take advantage of what we have

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:22.500
learned from G.
. Lewis. And on that happy note I

00:48:22.500 --> 00:48:26.166
will say have a good weekend.
We will see you on Monday.
