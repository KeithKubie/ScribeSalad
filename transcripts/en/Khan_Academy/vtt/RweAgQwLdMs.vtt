00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:02.780
We're asked to
solve the equation

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:07.550
2x squared plus
3 is equal to 75.

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:09.190
So in this situation,
it looks like we

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:12.890
might be able to isolate
the x squared pretty simply.

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:15.150
Because there's only one
term that involves an x here.

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.950
It's only this x squared term.

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:18.277
So let's try to do that.

00:00:18.277 --> 00:00:19.360
So let me just rewrite it.

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:24.250
We have 2x squared
plus 3 is equal to 75.

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:26.610
And we're going to try to
isolate this x squared over

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:26.820
here.

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.153
And the best way to do that,
or at least the first step,

00:00:29.153 --> 00:00:32.960
would be to subtract 3 from
both sides of this equation.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.270
So let's subtract
3 from both sides.

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.580
The left hand side, we're
just left with 2x squared.

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:41.690
That was the whole point of
subtracting 3 from both sides.

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:46.260
And on the right hand
side, 75 minus 3 is 72.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.070
Now, I want to isolate
this x squared.

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:49.780
I have a 2x squared here.

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.610
So I could have just
an x squared here

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.265
if I divide this side or
really both sides by 2.

00:00:54.265 --> 00:00:56.640
Anything I do to one side, I
have to do to the other side

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.370
if I want to maintain
the equality.

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.820
So the left side, just
becomes x squared.

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.540
And the right hand side
is 72 divided by 2 is 36.

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.290
So we're left with x
squared is equal to 36.

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.280
And then to solve for x,
we can take the positive,

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.720
the plus or minus square
root of both sides.

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:21.190
So we could say the plus or--
let me write it this way--

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:23.430
If we take the square
root of both sides,

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.230
we would get x is equal to
the plus or minus square root

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:33.316
of 36, which is equal
to plus or minus 6.

00:01:33.316 --> 00:01:34.940
Let me just write
that on another line.

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.010
So x is equal to
plus or minus 6.

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:40.877
And remember here, if something
squared is equal to 36,

00:01:40.877 --> 00:01:42.710
that something could
be the negative version

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:43.900
or the positive version.

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:45.400
It could be the
principal root or it

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:46.940
could be the negative root.

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.390
Both negative 6 squared is
36 and positive 6 squared

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.910
is 36, so both of these work.

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:55.160
And you could put them back
into the original equation

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:56.370
to verify it.

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:57.070
Let's do that.

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:00.210
If you say 2 times
6 squared plus 3,

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.040
that's 2 times 36, which
is 72 plus 3 is 75.

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.647
So that works.

00:02:05.647 --> 00:02:07.230
If you put negative
6 in there, you're

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:08.688
going to get the
exact same result.

00:02:08.688 --> 00:02:11.720
Because negative 6
squared is also 36.

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.820
2 times 36 is 72 plus 3 is 75.
