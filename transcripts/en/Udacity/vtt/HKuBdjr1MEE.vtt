00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.010
Let's look at the solution for our speed doubling quiz. This is a period of

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:10.194
36 years. If speed doubles every two years, that means that

00:00:10.194 --> 00:00:15.255
the speed has doubled 18 times. So, we have 2 to the 18th

00:00:15.255 --> 00:00:19.917
times 380. And if you multiply this out, it

00:00:19.917 --> 00:00:26.030
amounts to about 99 million kilometers per hour and change.

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:31.830
In reality, the speed record for trains has not even doubled between

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:37.001
1971 and 2007. The fastest thing that humankind ever built

00:00:37.001 --> 00:00:44.290
is the Voyager one probe. And its top speed was 62,000 kilimeters per hour.

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:50.844
If trains, since 197, followed speed doubling of processors,

00:00:50.844 --> 00:00:55.490
trains should have moved this fast by 1996.

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:58.185
So, as you can see, processors are one of

00:00:58.185 --> 00:01:01.573
those rare things that have observed speed doubling

00:01:01.573 --> 00:01:05.190
continuously for many years and are still doing that.
