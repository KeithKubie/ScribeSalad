00:00:00.531 --> 00:00:03.948
(happy electronic music)

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:10.490
- Gonna lift up the top card.

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:12.133
This is your card, remember this card?

00:00:18.915 --> 00:00:19.748
- Stop.

00:00:19.748 --> 00:00:22.554
- Right there, where you said
stop was where your card was.

00:00:22.554 --> 00:00:23.637
- Wait, what?

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:29.330
- I'm learning more stuff,

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.230
it's like, it's basically like magic

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:35.200
because like you start off here and then

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.850
at some point, when you don't expect it,

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:39.740
you'll get to another level.

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:42.110
- Get mine, where do I get mine?

00:00:43.363 --> 00:00:45.500
(kids mumble)

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.620
- There's constantly something going on.

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.119
Always busy, always noise.

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:52.786
- I walk away with the pink one.

00:01:00.554 --> 00:01:02.760
- Any mom who is raising
her kids alone is worried

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.810
that their kids are gonna fall behind

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:08.030
or not have enough of something to reach

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.483
where they should in life as they grow.

00:01:15.434 --> 00:01:18.200
- There was like some
things actually like,

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.440
in third grade that I
went back and relearned

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.103
and it actually helped me
a lot in the sixth grade.

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.390
One thing that really helped me

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.120
is where if you can't get it,

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.850
you can get a hint or watch the videos.

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.590
- When he's using the Khan Academy,

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.510
he tells me that he gets
to watch his progress

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:42.100
so he gets to see each step that he takes,

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:43.520
how far he's getting in it,

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.550
and that makes him motivated to keep going

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:48.800
and to get to the next level.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:53.643
And it's like instant
gratification for him.

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:56.040
(Sean mumbles)

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.274
- Oh.

00:01:57.274 --> 00:01:58.574
- That was the second one.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.270
- I am taking control of his learning

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.280
and just seeing his success,

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.850
it gives him his own boost of confidence.

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.493
Not just in the classroom, but at home.

00:02:16.582 --> 00:02:18.150
I'm extremely proud,

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.160
just seeing the little
person he's growing into

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.960
and the pride he has in himself

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:24.260
always makes me feel good

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.420
'cause then I feel like
I'm doing something right

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:27.533
as a parent.

00:02:27.533 --> 00:02:28.366
- Need help?

00:02:28.366 --> 00:02:30.040
I really like helping a lot.

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.710
Besides math and learning and all that,

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:35.383
that's one of my favorite things to do.
