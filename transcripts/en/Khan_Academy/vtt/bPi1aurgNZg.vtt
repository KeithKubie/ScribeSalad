00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.280
- [Instructor] Although they came

00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:02.950
from very different backgrounds,

00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:07.810
Arthur Brooks and Grace
Hopper were an early pioneer

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:09.980
in computer programming.

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:13.260
All right, so who is an early pioneer?

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:15.030
Well, they're talking
about two different people

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.230
being an early pioneer.

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.420
You have Arthur Brooks and Grace Hopper.

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:20.880
So you have two people.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.510
You have two people right over here.

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:25.570
And two people can't just
be one early pioneer,

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:27.480
as the underlined portion implies.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.350
It says an early pioneer.

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:30.320
Well, we have two people

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.360
so they're both going to be pioneers.

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.180
So they are both early pioneers,

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.000
so I would wanna replace
that with early, early,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.340
actually let me do it this way.

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.700
I wanna replace this with early pioneers

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.340
in computer programming
'cause we're talking

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:47.950
about two people being
pioneers, not just one.

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:50.420
And that is this choice right over here.

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:51.880
If you look at these other two choices,

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.320
these would be incorrect because
these are still referring

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.610
to only one person, a
pioneer, a very early pioneer.

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:59.880
We don't have just one pioneer,

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.580
we have two pioneers

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:04.223
so that's why we wanna go with pioneers.
