00:00:00.827 --> 00:00:02.660
LAURENCE MORONEY: Welcome
to the Googleplex.

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:05.210
This is an incredible place
with lots of great stuff being

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:07.950
worked on every single day.

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:09.980
Before I worked here,
I always wondered

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:12.290
what it would be like to
come to the Googleplex,

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:14.870
meet up with a Googler,
and have coffee with them

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:17.470
and just chat about what
they do, how they do it,

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:18.420
and why they do it.

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.352
And today, We're going
to do exactly that.

00:00:23.045 --> 00:00:25.170
Welcome to this episode of
"Coffee With a Googler."

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.850
And if you, like me,
love games and love

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:28.390
3D games and all
that kind of stuff,

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:30.160
then this show should
be a treat for you

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.340
because today I'm chatting
with Shannon Woods, who's

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.080
a technical program manager.

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.220
And she works on our
rendering teams at Google.

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:37.210
And she's got lots
of great stuff

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:38.590
to talk about in the 3D space.

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:39.820
So welcome, Shannon.

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:40.660
How are you?

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:41.280
SHANNON WOODS: I'm
doing all right.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:41.710
How are you?

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:42.440
LAURENCE MORONEY: Really good.

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.356
I have to say, I'm really
envious of your job.

00:00:44.356 --> 00:00:46.207
Could you us what you do?

00:00:46.207 --> 00:00:48.790
SHANNON WOODS: So I work with a
couple of rendering teams here

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:51.450
at Google, both
Android and Chrome.

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:56.860
And we sort of plumb code from
user space down to your GPU.

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:59.010
LAURENCE MORONEY: Wow.

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.016
Can you translate that?

00:01:01.016 --> 00:01:02.390
SHANNON WOODS:
Basically, our job

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.780
is to get a bunch of
triangles from applications

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.280
down to the GPU as
fast as possible.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.238
LAURENCE MORONEY: Cool.

00:01:08.238 --> 00:01:11.090
And all graphics are ultimately
made up of triangles, right?

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:12.880
SHANNON WOODS: Basically.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.250
LAURENCE MORONEY: Now
recently, you announced Vulcan.

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.795
And this is this new and
improved 3D rendering API.

00:01:17.795 --> 00:01:19.170
Could you tell us
a bit about it?

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.610
SHANNON WOODS: Historically,
Android and all mobile phones

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.910
really have used OpenGL ES
to communicate to the GPU

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:30.920
within the phone to tell
it how to draw scenes.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.660
But unfortunately,
over time, the API

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:36.640
has become less and
less of a good match

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.890
for what the hardware's
actually doing beneath.

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.250
So what would
happen is you would

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.670
use this API to communicate
a lot of the details

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:44.460
about your scene.

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.210
And the GPU has to
reorganize all of that

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.550
so that it can
consume it efficiently

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:51.970
and draw it on the screen.

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:54.490
So what Vulcan is--
it's another API

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.680
from the same open standards
group that makes OpenGL.

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.170
And it's designed to
be a lot closer to what

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.410
the hardware actually
does beneath the covers.

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:09.860
So if you provide
the data via Vulcan,

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.490
it should be able to
draw a lot quicker.

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:16.210
Sort of the flip side of
that is that it gives you

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:17.340
all of this control.

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.640
But it means that you have to
be pretty good at making sure

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.427
that your code is doing exactly
what you wanted it to do.

00:02:24.427 --> 00:02:26.010
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Vulcan and OpenGL ES

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.330
are both from the same
standards body, right?

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.580
SHANNON WOODS: Yes.

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:29.510
LAURENCE MORONEY:
So that's "Khronas"?

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.850
SHANNON WOODS: Yes.

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:30.580
Khronos.

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:31.990
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Khronos, sorry.

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:34.960
So you work with the
standards body at Khronos?

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:35.850
SHANNON WOODS: I do.

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.480
I get to travel all
around the world

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.090
and see beautiful
conference rooms.

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.640
But it's actually
really interesting

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.652
getting to see how the API
is made from the ground up.

00:02:48.652 --> 00:02:49.610
LAURENCE MORONEY: Cool.

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:53.460
SHANNON WOODS: Android is
going to support both OpenGL ES

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:54.440
and Vulcan.

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.850
So developers can
choose which API

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.710
is right for what they're
doing, like if they

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:04.630
need to render a FPS game, a
first person shooting game that

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.630
has to run really fast at a
high frame rate, then they're

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.740
going to probably want to choose
Vulcan so that they can closely

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:12.702
control exactly what's
being drawn and when.

00:03:12.702 --> 00:03:13.660
LAURENCE MORONEY: Cool.

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.160
SHANNON WOODS: But
if they just want

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.340
to get a couple of
shapes onscreen,

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.150
then OpenGL ES is probably
still the right choice for them.

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.880
LAURENCE MORONEY: Cool, cool.

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.240
So it's just really
nice to have both.

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.960
SHANNON WOODS: Yes.

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:23.350
LAURENCE MORONEY: Cool.

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:25.820
And from my understanding,
you were saying with Vulcan,

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:28.440
just being able to get
down to the chipset level

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.320
effectively allows you to
squeeze a lot more performance

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:33.270
out of the machine.

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:34.050
SHANNON WOODS: Yeah, it does.

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:35.716
And one of the other
things that it does

00:03:35.716 --> 00:03:38.950
is that it allows for
greater parallelization.

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:43.360
There's a lot of work in OpenGL
ES that it's blocking work.

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.470
You make a call into OpenGL
ES, into the driver code,

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.530
and it has to stop
and perform the task

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:53.870
that you asked it to do
and doesn't return control

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:56.750
to the application until
it finishes that task.

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:00.290
And what this means is that
if you have multiple threads,

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.540
only one of them can really
be talking to the driver,

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.640
doing these things
at the same time.

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:08.580
Vulcan is designed more for
multi-threaded applications

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.240
so that you can have
multiple threads doing things

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:13.927
like constructing buffers full
of commands at the same time.

00:04:13.927 --> 00:04:15.760
LAURENCE MORONEY: You're
getting onto, like,

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:16.720
programming and skills.

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.682
And from a skills
perspective, are there

00:04:19.682 --> 00:04:21.390
things that developers
will need to learn

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:23.110
that they don't do
already, for example,

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:25.150
if they're doing 3D
games in OpenGL ES?

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:26.650
SHANNON WOODS: So
the skill sets are

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:28.832
going to be largely the same.

00:04:28.832 --> 00:04:30.290
As a Vulcan developer,
you're going

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:32.880
to have to have probably
a tighter handle on things

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:37.572
like synchronization, careful
tracking of memory allocation

00:04:37.572 --> 00:04:39.280
because a lot less of
that is going to be

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:42.710
done for you by the driver.

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:44.510
The upside of this
is that the driver

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:46.875
won't be doing these things
when you don't expect it to.

00:04:46.875 --> 00:04:48.500
But you're going to
have to really hone

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:53.370
your skills at things like
multi-threaded synchronization,

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:56.810
memory allocation, make sure
that you are closely keeping

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:58.240
an eye on what
your code is doing

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.074
and what it's
asking the GPU to do

00:05:00.074 --> 00:05:02.490
because the driver is going
to do a whole lot less of that

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:02.990
for you.

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:05.720
It's not going to
clean up after you.

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:09.810
It's not going to check that
you're making legal calls.

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:12.580
So you're basically going to
have to be a bit of a ninja.

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:13.840
LAURENCE MORONEY: It's
almost like driving stick

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:15.112
versus driving manual, right?

00:05:15.112 --> 00:05:17.320
SHANNON WOODS: That's probably
a really good analogy.

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:18.750
LAURENCE MORONEY: So people
can learn about Vulcan

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:19.689
on the Khronos site?

00:05:19.689 --> 00:05:20.480
SHANNON WOODS: Yes.

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:22.313
LAURENCE MORONEY: So
that's khronos.org or--

00:05:22.313 --> 00:05:23.660
SHANNON WOODS: Khronos.org.

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:24.600
www.khronos.org.

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:28.340
And Khronos is
spelled K-H-R-O-N-O-S.

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:30.210
And they have a
Vulcan landing page,

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:34.570
where you can find the latest
news about Vulcan and also see

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:38.190
some of the presentations
that were given, for example,

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:42.215
at SIGGRAPH this year and at
GDC about the shape of the API.

00:05:42.215 --> 00:05:43.090
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:44.440
Now you were at SIGGRAPH, right?

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:45.150
SHANNON WOODS: I was SIGGRAPH.

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:46.620
LAURENCE MORONEY: How did it go?

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:48.453
SHANNON WOODS: It was
a lot of fun actually.

00:05:48.453 --> 00:05:51.350
We did some demos, showed
some spinning teapots.

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:52.510
LAURENCE MORONEY: Teapots?

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:54.093
SHANNON WOODS: So
there's a little bit

00:05:54.093 --> 00:05:55.720
of history behind the teapot.

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:58.580
The teapot is canonically
called the Utah teapot.

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:01.500
And it's because way back in the
history of computer graphics,

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:08.570
it's one of the first models
that was digitized and shared.

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:10.810
And interestingly, so
the teapot everybody

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:14.430
knows, that they've seen here
and there over the years-- it

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:16.930
looks short and squat.

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:18.480
But the reason for
that is actually

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:20.060
that on the original
display system,

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:21.689
the pixels were not square.

00:06:21.689 --> 00:06:22.730
So they had a different--

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:23.660
LAURENCE MORONEY: The
tiny little ones from TVs?

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:24.480
SHANNON WOODS: Yeah,
the aspect ratio

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:25.605
was a little bit different.

00:06:25.605 --> 00:06:28.110
So in real life, the teapot's
actually a little taller.

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:28.540
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Now you're saying

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:29.992
that the pixels are elongated?

00:06:29.992 --> 00:06:31.700
They were rectangular
pixels because this

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:32.970
was done so long ago?

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:33.140
SHANNON WOODS: Oh, yeah.

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:34.130
It was-- oh, gosh.

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:35.254
I guess it was the '70s.

00:06:35.254 --> 00:06:36.170
LAURENCE MORONEY: Wow.

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:40.409
So the first 3D model that
was formed in cyberspace

00:06:40.409 --> 00:06:42.450
or whatever you want to
call it back in the '70s.

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:44.241
And you're still using
the same model today

00:06:44.241 --> 00:06:46.860
to-- I think Pixar also
use the teapot, don't they?

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:47.693
SHANNON WOODS: Yeah.

00:06:47.693 --> 00:06:50.826
Actually, the teapot
appears in every Pixar film.

00:06:50.826 --> 00:06:52.910
And one of the ones I know
off the top of my head

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:55.815
is-- they use it in the tea
party scene in "Toy Story."

00:06:55.815 --> 00:06:56.690
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:06:56.690 --> 00:06:58.520
Naturally, that's where
a teapot would fit.

00:06:58.520 --> 00:06:58.930
SHANNON WOODS: Yeah.

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:00.250
But there's one in
every Pixar film.

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:01.360
LAURENCE MORONEY: Thank
you so much, Shannon.

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:02.100
SHANNON WOODS: Thank you.

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:03.100
LAURENCE MORONEY: And
thanks, everybody,

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:05.140
for watching this episode
of "Coffee With a Googler."

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:06.670
I don't know about you,
but I've learned a lot

00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:09.510
about the kind of things that
can be done with 3D graphics.

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:12.630
And I'm really, really excited
about Vulcan coming to Android.

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:14.120
If you've got any
questions for me,

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:15.930
or if you've got any
questions for Shannon,

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:17.840
just please leave them
in the comments below.

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:20.080
We'll also link to the
websites in the description

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:22.440
of this video so that you
can follow those links.

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:24.930
And if you want to learn
anything else about great stuff

00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:26.800
that Google has to
offer for Android

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:29.150
developers, Chrome developers,
and everybody else,

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:31.410
please subscribe to the
Google Developers channel.

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:31.910
Thank you.

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:35.060
