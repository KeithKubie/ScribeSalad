Speaker 1:          00:00          Now when you're looking down and it's an utter whiteout and you're looking at your compass and you're dragging this shit behind you, like are you doing anything in your mind? Are you like singing songs? Are you, what are you doing?

Speaker 2:          00:13          Um, there's a couple of different things, but really what ended up happening is I started to be able to trigger these flow states. So, you know, as a lifelong professional athlete through different capacities in my life, you know, I've tapped into that. You know, I was a swimmer when I was a little kid, so swimming laps in a pool, sometimes I would like kind of just happen to this like timeless space where, you know, maybe 30 minutes would go by in, in two minutes or something like that. But I never really knew how I got there. Just, it's sometimes tap into it, sometimes not, you know, the zone flow, state, whatever you want to call that. But in Antarctica, I went in with this sort of attention about intention of exploring that space in my mind. And so as I got more and more into these wideouts outs into these compass, in staring at this compass, staring at this expansive landscape, I started to find ways to actually trigger that flow state in my mind.

Speaker 2:          00:58          So it got to the point where I could for several days at a time, be in this deep flow state. So, you know, my day was about 17 hours every day between getting up, boiling my water, getting out of my tent, and those crazy conditions, packing my sled, dragging it for 13 hours, setting my tent back up in these storms. But I got into this sort of sequence of being so present with each step, each next sequence that it ended up being in this really timeless spaceless place in my mind of true high-performance that was almost like the most deepest, peaceful, meditative state that I can possibly imagine. It was. It was very profound and beautiful, uh, to get there in my mind. Wow.

Speaker 1:          01:34          No. Are you boiling this water in your tent?

Speaker 2:          01:37          Yeah. So my Ted Boyle. Yeah. So kind of a slightly different white gas fuels stove. So, not the canisters where you could throw away, but like gas that you could refill the stove but a stove with fuel. Um, basically the way my tent was, you saw the outer layer, the tent there. There's actually an inner part that's a tent so that there's a vestibule where basically there's snow inside the doorway but not outside, outside. So I would shovel that snow from inside of the tent vestibule into my pot and be able to melt the water that way. Um, I drank about six liters of water every single day, um, when I was out there, which no, it's just a lot of snow, a lot of antiques, a few hours to melt that. But people don't realize this in order cause actually the largest desert in the world. Um, so it's actually very dry. It doesn't snow very often, but when it does, of course never melt in the South Pole was at 9,000, 300 feet. So not only am I in this desert, but I'm at altitude doing this thing. So

Speaker 1:          02:32          did you train it out to two? Did you use like one of those tents to sleep in or,

Speaker 2:          02:36          yeah, so there's a, this gym that Mike and I train out of, it's called evolution, healthcare and fitness in Portland. Um, they actually have an altitude room there so that it's not even a tent, but they actually have a full, a full room where you can, you know, got rowing machines. It's got treadmills. It's got all that stimulated up to about 14,000 fees. It's about 400 square feet, high ceilings, big. I mean, it's not like cute, but it's a big enough. Yeah, it's like a proper room. I've been in some of those tents before when I was racing triathlon many years ago, a lot of people were starting to sleep in those tents, but black people have a hard time and then they get warm and stuff like that. I know a lot of fighters use them as well. Um, but, uh, but yeah, it was pretty cool to have a full room that you can actually, you know, be in and move in properly, um, for just simulate some of the high intensity stuff.

Speaker 2:          03:17          Yeah. And so it would take you hours every day to make your water? Yeah, I would say I was boiling water for about three, four hours per day. So about an hour or two in the morning, hour or two in the evening. Uh, it takes a lot of energy to boil, you know, frozen snow when it's that cold out. Um, she had to carry to carry a lot of fuel. That was the other really heavy composed sled. It's like hundreds of hours of fuel. Yeah. So I took about, uh, 17 liters of fuel. So that's what, six gallons or something like that. Oh, wow. How'd you know that that was going to be enough? Uh, I did some practicing beforehand. Um, I, I, in 2016 I did another world record project where I climbed the tallest mountain on each of the seven continents, seven summits, as well as when to the north and South Pole, but much smaller polar expeditions a week, uh, basically crossing the last degree of latitude.

Speaker 2:          04:04          And so when those expeditions Alpha was on Everest during that time to not only et Cetera, all of that in 139 days, um, but I did that and that kind of helped me get a sense of it. But honestly it was also best guess based on talking to people, different experts in the field, you know, diving into that. But you never know is it going to be enough or too little? I'm here on the side of too much. When you, when, when you finally got to the end, how much did you have left? So my final push, I actually, I woke up on uh, the morning of Christmas Eve 24th of December this past year and it looked, I was 77 miles from the finish and I've been going at that point, at the beginning of the trip I was only going nine, 10 miles per day. Towards the end I started going on about 20, 25 miles per day.

Speaker 2:          04:44          So I said, you know what, like I'm about three days out. And then I thought to myself, maybe if I could push really hard these next two days, I could do it in two days, like two 15 plus hour days. Like really get into it and started looking at my fuel and food supplies and like they were pretty low. I had had enough fuel, a few, a few liters of fuel, but I actually only had about a day or two of food, like real substantial food left. Um, and so I woke up and I was like, all right, let's go for this. And in the actually deepest talk about flow states, that was the deepest flow state of my life. I woke up in one hour in that day, it's Christmas morning now I wake up and I'm just locked in and I just came. I didn't tell anyone back home, didn't tell my wife who was tracking me.

Speaker 2:          05:23          They had this gps tracker where they could follow me. But I was just in my mind I was like, you know what? Not not three days, not two days. I'm going straight for it. And so I did a final 32 hour continuous push on day 54 77 miles straight, drag in my sled all the way to get to the finish line in one continuous push. No music, no nothing. Just like in my head in this, in this crazy flow state of, of, of, I don't know, high performance. Um, and it was, it was like, it was a crazy final push to get there, but a made it right before the food and fuel ran out. Oh my God. And then there's, there's no one there of course. Right. You crossed the finish line. You're like, done this. No one in the world has ever done this.

Speaker 2:          06:02          Applause. Nope. Zero. And so what do you do when you get to the end? You said, hey, I'm done. Come get me. Yeah. Yeah. How long does it take for them to come get you? It took me a week to get out of Antarctica. Totally took actually me four days to get out of there. Um, but there's a crazy other component to this, which is no one in the world had ever done this before. And like I said, a few really talented people. Some of the best explorers in the world had tried recently. One guy died. Um, and it just so happened there's a really specific season when you can attempt this. But another guy was attempting this at the exact same time as me. I'm a British, a British guy who's a equivalent of a navy seal, you know, British special forces, the living most experienced guy in Antarctica is actually pulled 3000 plus miles and an article now on various expeditions.

Speaker 2:          06:47          And so we got dropped off one mile away from each other to begin this thing. And um, obviously I was the first, I did win this race head to head and at the finish line I waited for him for a few days cause I wanted to congratulate him cause he did ultimately finished. But you can only imagine I would vote. Going back to that first hour, I was like, it's impossible. It was also like, it's impossible. And both the, by the way, this navy seal dude who knows more about Antarctica, me, he's often going, I can see him in the distance just like leaving me in the dust. Um, but fortunately after day six I caught up to him, you know, I waved to him in this weird like passing of the torch moment. Like I was passing him and then I never saw him again until I finished and I finished about a 70 miles ahead of him, about two and a half days ahead of them.

Speaker 2:          07:28          That's going to suck for him. Imagines, look, I got this mother Fucker, I brought it home for America, man. You know, appreciate that. We all will appreciate that, but still, that's going suck for him. Yeah. So I actually, even though I finished in the first thing I could have kind of wanted to do, I haven't had, I haven't had a shower. I haven't, I actually to save weight so I could get as much food and fuel with my sled. I brought no extra clothes, no extra pair of underwear, like literally no extra pair of underwear, no prepared. So I grow. Where are you shitting out there? Everyone wants to know this, so let's just get it all the table. Thank you for asking. Um, I basically, I described that vestibule situation. So one side I cook in, right? If the wind is calm, I get out of my tent, dig a hole and you know, go shit in a whole basically.

Speaker 2:          08:14          But when it's real windy, like those storms, I just watch like you're going to get frost bite if you try to, you know, bend over, pull your pants down when it's minus 80 hours. So in the vestibule of my tent, not the side I'm cooking on, but the other side where I'm still inside covered, I dig a hole in there. That was my morning routine. Get up at 6:00 AM, start boiling my water at one side of my tent and it's not glamorous. It's not a pretty thing at debate. Actually, to me, this is very cool, but also not glamorous. Um, within one degree of latitude of the south pole. So the last degree of latitude at 89 degrees to south poles at 90 degrees, it's basically 69 miles or 60 nautical miles circumference around the south pole. Antarctica being as pristine as it is, they have all these laws about environmental conservation, which to me is amazing.

Speaker 2:          08:54          Being someone who loves and is a great steward of the land, they actually say you can't even leave your human waste in holes here even though there's nobody out there. They're like, we want this to be completely protected area. And so yes, usually my sled was getting lighter most of the time cause I was eating food everyday and burning fuel. But in that last degree of latitude to the south pole and crossing it, I was shitting in a bag, wrapping it up and putting it in my sled and having to carry it with me. So, um, yeah. Wow. It shows discipline. She was something a lot of people have been like, hey yeah, put it in a book. Fuck you crazy assholes. One's up there. Who cares if I take a shit up there? It was tempting, but you know, so I grew up in the going out in the outdoors and just is leave no trace principle that I, you know, I really love.

Speaker 2:          09:40          And in particularly Antarctica, one of the things about Antarctica, it's one of those places where I imagine you've traveled far and wide and your life and there's some few places, at least in my mind, where you just, you can't put it into words until you've stepped off there. And for me, this was my second time and an article on both times. You know, this big cargo ship basically lands you on the continent. Then you get into smaller plan to get dropped off to where I needed to start on the edge of the continent. But both times stepping off the plane, I'm just shit eating grin ear to ear on my face because I just am like, Whoa, what is this place? Even the second time seeing it, I felt that I'd like, my cheeks were sore because I was just smiling. So big of just the pristine beauty, the blank canvas.

Speaker 2:          10:18          The amine, you look out on the land and like human footprints haven't touched 98% of the continents, something like that. I mean, it's untouched and so shitting in a bag, if I had to do that to do my part, to keep it that way, uh, I wasn't shit. Did you drag, uh, at the end it was about three. You reuse the bags. One per day for at that section is about 120 miles. It took me, I don't know, a week or so to cover that distance. So, um, yeah, added, added weight to my sled rather than subtracting during. That was the middle part of the journey. Red around the 30th and 40th day.
