1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:05,650
You are listening to
radio lab radio from W.

2
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:07,200
N y. S. T. E. Yup.

3
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:14,190
So maybe you just want to start at the
beginning. So how did you bump into this?

4
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:14,640
Well,

5
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:18,390
you hate doing falling financial stories
and that I did some financial stories,

6
00:00:18,391 --> 00:00:18,880
but I,

7
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:23,880
I think my beat was more people in the
headlines at the worst moment of their

8
00:00:24,361 --> 00:00:29,361
lives and then I would go in and become
their friends and in the way we talk we

9
00:00:30,271 --> 00:00:35,271
would talk intimately about what downfall
means when you've been at the mountain

10
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:37,103
top.

11
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:42,920
Hey, I'm Jen Abu Rod, I'm Robert
Krulwich, Radiolab and today

12
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:46,030
the rest of Wall Street
legend or Lard Maydoff

13
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:51,570
a behind the scenes look at the
greatest financial fraud in history.

14
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:56,220
Billion Dolan Pyramids. Let's the hell
is going on here. Who is buying Milliken?

15
00:00:56,710 --> 00:01:00,710
Tom have to wait. Come on by. I know
you got that money man. Whatever money.

16
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:06,370
It's a series called Ponzi supernova from
audible.com and she just set up how we

17
00:01:06,371 --> 00:01:09,010
got to it. Ellen Horne,
the Great Ellen Horn,

18
00:01:09,011 --> 00:01:11,920
who was one of the founding members
of radio lab a couple of years ago.

19
00:01:11,921 --> 00:01:15,550
She left us, it was very sad for
us, but she went off to audible,

20
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:18,250
teamed up with a guy named Steve
Fishman who you just heard.

21
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:23,140
And together they produced this series
which has tape in it that has never

22
00:01:23,141 --> 00:01:27,100
before been heard. And it's pretty
extraordinary and kind of, uh, you know,

23
00:01:27,101 --> 00:01:30,010
given what's happened recently
with financial reforms up,

24
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:34,990
up for reconsideration, what you're
about to hear, you will find, uh,

25
00:01:34,991 --> 00:01:37,990
a little bit troubling and
extremely timely. Yeah.

26
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:40,210
And so what we did a couple of days ago,

27
00:01:40,211 --> 00:01:45,211
we got Steve and Ellen into the studio
to play us some stuff and to talk about

28
00:01:46,841 --> 00:01:50,740
it. Yeah, sure. You spend the
first episode really, oh, sorry.

29
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:55,810
You spend the first episode really
chasing the guy trying to get access to

30
00:01:55,811 --> 00:01:56,860
Bernie Madoff in prison.

31
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:59,770
Yeah. You know, I did all
kinds of things. I mean,

32
00:01:59,771 --> 00:02:01,990
this was like years long pursuit.

33
00:02:01,991 --> 00:02:05,140
I would send Bernie novels in the mail.

34
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:09,160
I would try and insult him.

35
00:02:09,161 --> 00:02:13,510
I copied out Sartre's play, no
exit, and I sent that to him.

36
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,420
You know, just to try and get a rise. I,

37
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:21,460
I put money in his commissary
account and then, you know,

38
00:02:21,461 --> 00:02:25,420
sent him a, you're welcome note.
Never receiving a response.

39
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:29,770
Do you know why at this point what
was driving this? I mean, listen,

40
00:02:29,771 --> 00:02:31,120
Bernie has done this.

41
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:34,660
I mean everybody knows and we keep
reading about the details and we keep

42
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:38,800
triangulating Bernie from friends
who very obviously didn't know him.

43
00:02:38,801 --> 00:02:43,150
Investors who filed easily, obviously
didn't know him. I want to hear this guy.

44
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:48,220
Tell me, I want to say Bernie. Why did
you do this? You were already rich.

45
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:51,520
Come on. What's going on here? I mean,

46
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:57,300
Bernie had the greatest seed in the
house to what was going on behind the

47
00:02:59,771 --> 00:03:02,560
scenes. So uh, Steve has
explained to us for years,

48
00:03:02,561 --> 00:03:05,560
he just kept pestering the guy
in Paris. Stubborn man. Yeah.

49
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:08,950
In a talking to like a whole
series of other prisoners,

50
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,480
asking them to get the word to Bernie.

51
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:14,770
And eventually just to cut to the
chase one day my home phone rings.

52
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:18,010
So I pick it up. It's a Sunday evening.

53
00:03:18,011 --> 00:03:23,011
The jets came is on and I got my two
young kids running around and it's,

54
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:26,710
you have a collect call from an
inmate at a federal prison and then,

55
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:31,270
and then you hear Bernie's voice saying
Bernard Madoff in this kind of slightly

56
00:03:31,271 --> 00:03:35,650
did kind of discussed it, a tone
of voice. And, and I was like,

57
00:03:35,651 --> 00:03:39,220
Captain Ahab. But now you have kids
running around the room at jets game on,

58
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:43,570
here's the phone call. Oh my God.
Are you ready? Oh, and I'm not ready.

59
00:03:43,571 --> 00:03:45,880
I don't have a pen and
paper. I don't have a,

60
00:03:45,881 --> 00:03:49,590
a tape recorder and my kids
are in the background. So my,

61
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:53,800
my first reaction to Birdie on
the phone is, hey, kids shut up.

62
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:54,903
It's Bernie made.

63
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:01,210
So then it called comment only in
15 minute bursts. And um, then,

64
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,990
uh, the, for whatever reason,
yeah, exactly. 15 minutes.

65
00:04:04,991 --> 00:04:07,540
Exactly 15 minutes. It just ends.

66
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:12,170
And then the inmate has to wait
15 minutes to call you back. Wow.

67
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:15,740
So he hangs up. I know I have 15
minutes. I'm running around him.

68
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:20,710
I must have a tape recorder and then
I find one in the closet. I, you know,

69
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:21,573
tested it.

70
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:23,730
Ada [inaudible]

71
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:26,940
at this point we're just
going to drop into the series.

72
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:32,510
Bernie. Yeah. You got, you got total in
the middle of saying something. Situate.

73
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:35,540
Just do it. I was so, it just got cut off.

74
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:39,560
Well yeah, I was just saying it was
great to talk to you because you know,

75
00:04:39,561 --> 00:04:43,730
talking to you in person is so different
than reading about you all the kind of

76
00:04:43,731 --> 00:04:48,110
caricature out there and the whole
sense of you as being a, you know,

77
00:04:48,111 --> 00:04:50,030
just as one dimensional person.

78
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:53,550
It was nice talking to you too.
Stay there through all these years.

79
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:56,260
So it had been done.

80
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,930
So a burning made off is the greatest
financial crook in history questions,

81
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,880
but his voice is familiar to me.

82
00:05:03,881 --> 00:05:07,420
Male or Madoff could be the
uncle I run into at Bar Mitzvahs.

83
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:09,490
We have common roots,

84
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,900
middle-class New York Jews and
also an interest in the jet

85
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:18,780
going up the game or you know, I got it
recorded. [inaudible] yeah, I like that.

86
00:05:18,781 --> 00:05:23,490
I can [inaudible] if I want to. What do
you do? Are you near the TV room now?

87
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:26,360
Yeah, yeah. Just phones are
right. Right near the TV. Okay.

88
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:31,230
I tried to imagine the former chairman
of the Nasdaq at a pay phone in a cell

89
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:35,710
block, inmates lined up behind
him with prison Mae tattoos,

90
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:40,070
prison honed muscles. Oh, and you
can and you can call at night too.

91
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:42,910
Yeah. I call it til 10 30 at night.

92
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:46,240
Prison is not what Bernie expected.

93
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:51,450
The way depicted of you. You were over
the dope bars on the windows, you know,

94
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:57,000
with the doors that I blocked that night.
I a nice pretty big picture window.

95
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:58,723
Open it.

96
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:01,290
Yeah. I mean I guess aside
from being, you know,

97
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:03,590
separated from everybody in Weldon.

98
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,900
Oh, it's, you know, ain't my family

99
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:07,550
probably not talking at Ruth right now.

100
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:12,350
No, it's just uh, the whole
thing is uh, you know,

101
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:16,190
it's just, I look, I,
I know you'll never go.

102
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,633
Yeah.

103
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:28,690
Time's up. It's frustrating. A
call starts, we build momentum.

104
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:32,830
Bernie begins to open up and
then the guillotine falls.

105
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:38,250
Trust is tough to build on the timer and
I need to be the person he will trust

106
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:41,950
with the whole story,
at least as he sees it.

107
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:47,230
Bernie lets me know he has a story
to tell. He's been misunderstood.

108
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:51,790
I'm a good person. He tells
me he starts with this.

109
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:56,060
His family didn't have a clue.
Bernie insists he shielded

110
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,510
his family. No,

111
00:06:57,790 --> 00:07:02,790
Billy kept them in the dark until the
unseasonably warm afternoon of December 10

112
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:05,130
2008

113
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:08,630
Joe is sort of in a panic
about the whole all in thing.

114
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:13,600
He was at his office, Bernard l
Madoff securities, a family business.

115
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:18,500
What happened was [inaudible] came into
my brother during the afternoon and

116
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:23,170
said, what's wrong with that? Terrible.

117
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:28,880
It's just falling apart. Uh,

118
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:31,470
my brother came in 37, you know,

119
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,630
you have to call the boys and something
to call. They don't know what it is.

120
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:39,240
And I said, I will on my own. I did
that. I said, I can't tell them to you.

121
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:42,260
All of us is up, just gonna fall apart.
So, and I haven't heard from her.

122
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,360
She had no idea.

123
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:48,810
So we got into my car and we
drove a few blocks going drive,

124
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:54,220
drove into the new blocks to
the apartment. Fifth was hall.

125
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:56,830
We had bikes as part of that night.

126
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:58,430
They went into Bernie study,

127
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:00,960
that's what I broke down.
And I told them, uh,

128
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:07,760
crying and I played to him. [inaudible]

129
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:13,690
got all this money out and I, you know,
I'm not going to be able to recover it.

130
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:16,180
And I was crying, right. And

131
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,960
took me in his office and
felt sorry for me. Uh,

132
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:27,650
you know, I don't think it
is. Oh, totally. Fuck it.

133
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:31,810
Everybody was standing there talking, uh,

134
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:36,120
that I should have brought, I don't know
what else to tell you. I said, but, uh,

135
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:42,190
I don't know what you're supposed to
do now that I've told you this. So, uh,

136
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:44,470
and nobody gets angry at that point.

137
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:48,880
Everybody was fun that they were shocked.
I mean, it was, and they were shocked,

138
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:50,050
you know,

139
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:55,050
have you looked [inaudible] one day and
think your body is running this all a

140
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:59,750
billion dollar business and
everything is fine and he's happy,

141
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:05,070
they're happy and all of a sudden
the world comes crashing down.

142
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:08,820
Uh, they thought the is
the last time I have cried.

143
00:09:08,821 --> 00:09:12,700
Like that was witnessing all.
When I found out my son, my dad's

144
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:14,620
Andrew, Bernie's youngest son,

145
00:09:14,621 --> 00:09:17,500
had been diagnosed with
lymphoma five years earlier.

146
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:22,240
He fought it and recovered fully.
He considered changing jobs,

147
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:26,830
but Bernie talked him into returning
to work beside his dad, his brother,

148
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:28,720
his uncle, his first cousin.

149
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:31,650
The family all got along
well together and uh,

150
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:34,560
it was wonderful having them there.
I mean, we were very close family.

151
00:09:34,561 --> 00:09:39,000
I was very proud of my son. They
were proud of me, you know, uh,

152
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:42,390
what I accomplished it like being a
Bagel off they hit and it was a lot of

153
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:46,890
recognition in that while I was respected
in the industry before this happened,

154
00:09:46,891 --> 00:09:51,891
that they loved that and I love having
them in the business because it was

155
00:09:52,651 --> 00:09:55,540
successful at it. I kept them
totally out of the loop. I mean,

156
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:56,590
I didn't want to do it.

157
00:09:56,830 --> 00:10:01,810
I could let that be part of the loop and
now all of a sudden they feel as it was

158
00:10:01,811 --> 00:10:05,500
this other side that
they didn't really know.

159
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:08,770
As for what happened next, the
afternoon, I told them all,

160
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:12,730
they immediately left. They went
to a lawyer. The lawyer said,

161
00:10:12,731 --> 00:10:16,930
you gotta turn your father in a
way that in. I never saw them again

162
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:22,420
and didn't hear from them again until
two years into Bernie's 150 years

163
00:10:22,431 --> 00:10:23,240
sentence,

164
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:28,240
his oldest son mark sent a message in the
most horrible way the chaplain came to

165
00:10:28,431 --> 00:10:33,431
get you and what does he bring you to
the chapel and roots on the phone and she

166
00:10:34,401 --> 00:10:35,234
tells you?

167
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:36,883
Yeah,

168
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:42,200
I cried for a well over
two weeks after he die.

169
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:47,890
Mark Madoff killed himself at age 46
hung himself with a dog leash in his soho

170
00:10:48,651 --> 00:10:52,010
loft while his toddler
slept in the room next door,

171
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:58,030
the date December 11 2010 two years to
the day after his father's arrest to

172
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,820
Burnie. Mark's message to him
was clear, you ruined my life.

173
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:09,410
I tried. I tried in private
because I didn't want to do it.

174
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:12,561
[inaudible] if they switch over,

175
00:11:12,561 --> 00:11:16,190
they probably would've put date
cause suicide squad is what they do.

176
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,750
They all worried about me.

177
00:11:17,751 --> 00:11:21,380
They woke me up every hour on the hour
to make sure that I was okay to God.

178
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:25,710
I was a basket case for four weeks and

179
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:30,670
Bernie told me he still hoped he
could reach Andrew and explain.

180
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:35,920
But Andrew's cancer returned. He blamed
the relapse on his father's crimes.

181
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:41,050
The stress and shame of it
all. Andrew Madoff died in 2014

182
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:46,200
I have tears in my eyes and I've told
my views about certain things are not a

183
00:11:46,201 --> 00:11:50,700
day goes by tonight. I don't stop
her. It sounds okay on the phone.

184
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,980
Trust me, I'm not okay. You never will be.

185
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,090
Bernie though is a survivor.

186
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:00,650
Once he confessed to the largest
Ponzi scheme in history for him,

187
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,030
the worst was over.

188
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:07,310
It must have been something of a relief
to finally be able to get this off your

189
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:08,150
shoulders.

190
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:12,770
Oh, it was IB. I wish that
I would've caught earlier.

191
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:17,990
I was under tremendous pressure.
It was, it was absolute.

192
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:21,080
It was a nightmare. Only for me.

193
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,930
It was only a nightmare for me.

194
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:27,510
Yeah. I mean, you were looking down the
barrel of this for you. I guess you,

195
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,420
you Kinda knew it would end up here.
Uh, you know where you are now.

196
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:32,650
Sooner or later.

197
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:33,601
It's what I say,

198
00:12:33,601 --> 00:12:38,601
nightmare [inaudible] imagine not being
able to tell anybody that I destroyed

199
00:12:39,121 --> 00:12:44,040
the family. They said, why did
you need to do this? And I said,

200
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,233
I don't know.

201
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:48,530
Yeah, see me. That's what I try to
stick around here once a week. Yeah,

202
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:52,270
the psychologist, I fortunately,

203
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:57,510
they have a wonderful psychologists here
and they're very helpful to me. Wow,

204
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:00,360
that's great. That's right.
Believe me. That's great.

205
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:03,030
I have pupil sessions with her every week.

206
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:09,100
The New Yorker and his shrink seeking
reassurance, searching for answers.

207
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:11,470
Where does a monster come from?

208
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:15,210
I asked him, am I a sociopath? Privacy.

209
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:19,900
You're absolutely not a sociopath.
They said you have borrows,

210
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:21,270
you have Rabois

211
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,440
I came to think of my conversations
with Bernie as a kind of session too.

212
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:28,470
So I, I, Steve just, I
mean I'm just curious.

213
00:13:28,471 --> 00:13:31,180
W what are you thinking at this
point as you're talking to, I mean,

214
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:35,230
we're running through his story and we've
developed the kind of rapport, I mean,

215
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:40,450
you know, there's a different
generation, but Jewish roots,

216
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:44,740
New York area. This is a guy
who's familiar to me and I,

217
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:49,780
and we develop a report and Bernie kind
of tells me the story of his father and

218
00:13:49,781 --> 00:13:51,280
of how he got into this.

219
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:54,730
I bought it, built a sporting
goods business. He owed the top,

220
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:58,330
they called dodger sporting
goods dented, but as a joke,

221
00:13:58,331 --> 00:14:03,040
a little too punching page.
Right, on a metal rods. Yeah.

222
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:06,160
And the a big successful business.

223
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:09,680
And then during the Korean
War it was a skill shortage.

224
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:12,160
She couldn't get steel
and it is business fail.

225
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:13,933
[inaudible]

226
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:18,480
so you know, I lived through that. You
Watch that happen, you see your father,

227
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:18,921
oh boy.

228
00:14:18,921 --> 00:14:23,921
You idolize your build a big business
and then everything you fight about,

229
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:28,000
uh, you know, bad, something
like that happening.

230
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:32,910
Bernie was determined to attain
success, lasting success.

231
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:36,900
The kind that had alluded
his father, whatever it took.

232
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,870
I started the company in 1960

233
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:43,750
[inaudible]

234
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:44,980
22 years old.

235
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:49,810
He convinces a handful of
investors to trust him. Friends,

236
00:14:49,811 --> 00:14:53,510
parents, former customers of his
high school, lawn sprinkler business,

237
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,390
clients of his father-in-law's
accounting firm.

238
00:14:56,450 --> 00:15:00,230
The first thing I did was I
participated in a couple of Zulu issues.

239
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:06,230
New issues were hot in the 1960s though
without the mad scramble and hype of

240
00:15:06,511 --> 00:15:10,050
today's IPOs. Back then there was no CNBC,

241
00:15:10,051 --> 00:15:12,780
no computers with new issues.

242
00:15:12,781 --> 00:15:16,380
He thought he'd hit on a moneymaking
strategy and then the Walgett

243
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:21,330
correct the 62 with the Chub
and missile crisis. Right.

244
00:15:21,331 --> 00:15:23,260
The whole noise should walk
and wedded to the cane.

245
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:30,220
Bernie lost almost all of his
clients' money as he tells it.

246
00:15:30,221 --> 00:15:35,080
He was embarrassed. He was in
tears. We took them to her father.

247
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:38,890
Bernie begged for a bail out.
His father in law saved him.

248
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:41,260
Bernie needed a better strategy.

249
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,480
We looked for a list of places
where we could have a ditch.

250
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:46,260
The odds were against
him as he sought Bernie.

251
00:15:46,261 --> 00:15:48,000
Wasn't one of the Wall Street elite.

252
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:51,480
Did they make that clear that you know
you're, you're not in the club and,

253
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:54,900
Oh yeah. I mean it was obvious to
everybody. I mean, everybody knew it.

254
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:59,160
You know, we were a small firm. You want
to remember the duo stock fishing age.

255
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:02,040
You know, it was very obvious.

256
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:07,470
Steve says that idea like of Bernie as
that as a lower class kid from queens who

257
00:16:08,081 --> 00:16:12,010
wanted to prove himself to the big
boys and be accepted. Steve says,

258
00:16:12,011 --> 00:16:15,710
that's one of the keys to really
understanding how a guy like Bernie Madoff

259
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:18,130
could have gotten into
this gigantic fraud.

260
00:16:18,131 --> 00:16:21,760
Because when Bernie's business
started to really take off,

261
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:24,160
possibly increasingly through fraud,

262
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:28,330
all of a sudden he had all of these guys
from the big banks calling them up and

263
00:16:28,331 --> 00:16:29,560
wanting to take him out to lunch.

264
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:33,360
By the mid nineties word had spread
people clamored to put their money in

265
00:16:33,361 --> 00:16:34,570
Madoff's IAA business.

266
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:38,610
So I opened up the individual accounts
on people and I started thinking of these

267
00:16:38,611 --> 00:16:39,420
funds.

268
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:43,620
She Funds Bank funds and feeder funds
created to funnel money to Madoff who

269
00:16:43,621 --> 00:16:47,820
pumped out those incredibly
consistent returns.

270
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:50,810
So all of a sudden, if you
have all these major banks,

271
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:53,120
it's flattering. It's
flattering too. All right.

272
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:56,560
Yeah, of course it is. It feeds your ego.
I mean, you know, you say to yourself,

273
00:16:56,561 --> 00:16:59,440
all right, all of a sudden these banks,
which would give you the time of day,

274
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:02,800
all of a sudden they're willing
to give you affiliate dollars.

275
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:07,200
I had already major banks
coming down and the treating me,

276
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:09,120
it isn't hard trip.

277
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:15,520
Everyone wanted to be with Bernie
country club golfers, hedge funds,

278
00:17:15,521 --> 00:17:16,670
prestigious banks.

279
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:19,650
So they, they, they study if they should
have been given, start out or fun,

280
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:23,770
you know, but we need you to give it to
the bunny. No, he, okay. I, you know,

281
00:17:23,771 --> 00:17:28,120
I think I can do it cause I thought that
even if I started the short form of the

282
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:32,800
stock to them, we just see a matter
of weeks or months and you know,

283
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:33,960
I'd be able to recover from it.

284
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:40,060
According to Bernie, this was the turning
point. The market went against him.

285
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:45,190
The boy genius failed. And the delusion
of money, that was his undoing.

286
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:50,170
He couldn't move billions of
dollars in an out of market. My

287
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:54,400
mistake was I just should've left it
at that. Instead, these partners just,

288
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:58,810
you know, just get up pouring money into
me. And it was very hard to turn down

289
00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:02,330
irresistible for the young
man once shut out of the club.

290
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,850
I mean, I guess the other thing
there is, you know, we'll,

291
00:18:04,851 --> 00:18:08,690
you had a history of uh, you
know, breaking up the, uh,

292
00:18:08,691 --> 00:18:13,460
the country club at the New York Stock
Exchange with the market makers and uh,

293
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:16,320
you know, now in some
sense I guess you're,

294
00:18:16,321 --> 00:18:20,630
you're finally getting the recognition
from those kind of same people that uh,

295
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:21,790
they need you.

296
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:24,670
Yeah, that's right. And
then it just, it just,

297
00:18:24,671 --> 00:18:26,320
the whole thing sort
of spun out of control

298
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:30,520
then let me just, can I get something
out of the way till Ponzi scheme,

299
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:35,420
which we sort of need to know Ponzi scheme
is I give you money to invest. Yeah.

300
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:38,200
You pretend you invest
that money but you don't.

301
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:42,040
Instead what you do is you go out and
you get new investors, take their money,

302
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,090
give it to me,

303
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:46,180
and then you go out and get even
newer investors take their money,

304
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:49,240
give it to the ones before
them and on and on and on.

305
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,880
So like all you're doing is
just repositioning money.

306
00:18:51,881 --> 00:18:55,300
Like taking it from the new guys,
giving it to the slightly less new guys,

307
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:59,830
making it look like you're trading when
you're not and it only works as long as

308
00:18:59,831 --> 00:19:01,240
you have new people coming in.

309
00:19:01,241 --> 00:19:05,110
You have need a constant stream of
new people coming in with new money.

310
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:10,500
But that all sort of fell apart in 2008
2008 when we had a huge stock market

311
00:19:11,741 --> 00:19:16,120
crash, Bernie woke up after decades.
He was getting a lot of money in.

312
00:19:16,121 --> 00:19:19,870
All of a sudden one day people said, I
want my money back. That's true. Me Too.

313
00:19:19,871 --> 00:19:20,291
Me Too.

314
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:25,150
And he had not done anything except expect
more money to come through the front

315
00:19:25,151 --> 00:19:27,790
door on that day. There was no
money coming in the front door.

316
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,100
It just, the whole thing
sort of spun out of control.

317
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:32,580
And so Barney's version,

318
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:36,390
the fraud started because impressive
people threw money at him.

319
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:39,240
A good person who made a mistake

320
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:45,560
and we spend hours talking about this
and it seems to me at some point that

321
00:19:45,671 --> 00:19:49,930
there's always going to be that next phone
call. But there's that gap, you know,

322
00:19:49,931 --> 00:19:52,490
15 minutes. I have to wait
until the phone rings and,

323
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:56,890
and one time the phone doesn't
ring. Bernie doesn't call back.

324
00:19:57,250 --> 00:20:02,250
And I get from the prison a letter
basically explaining that I have been

325
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:08,170
declared a security risk.
What is a security risk mean?

326
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:12,430
I have no idea. And you know, it's
some kind of catchall. I mean,

327
00:20:12,431 --> 00:20:16,060
I tried to appeal that to the bureau
of prisons that it's unappealable.

328
00:20:16,061 --> 00:20:19,480
So basically the warden says, you know,
we don't want this. There's a hassle,

329
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:21,160
you know, he's a security risk. He can't,

330
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:25,700
don't, and, and, and, and just to
synopsize just so at this point,

331
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:30,800
having spent a hunk of time,
you, you went into this thinking,

332
00:20:30,801 --> 00:20:34,970
okay, I'm going to sit in his
shoes and I'm gonna feel him.

333
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,090
And where are you right now at this point?

334
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:43,010
So now I've spoken to him for
three or more hours. And you know,

335
00:20:43,011 --> 00:20:47,060
I've taken this journey with him.
I've heard his story. I know you,

336
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:52,260
I have felt some empathy for
Bernie from his point of view.

337
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:54,970
And so now I start to
listen to the tapes and I,

338
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,550
I start to really kind of dig in and uh,

339
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:02,170
and it occurs to me that
Bernie's telling me two stories.

340
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:08,190
Bernie Madoff on one hand is this wizard
conducting this incredible financial

341
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:14,890
criminal wizardry, a master mind. And on
the other hand, he's this kind of pawn.

342
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:17,250
Aw

343
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:21,180
Huh. Not a word you normally
associate with Bernie Meda.

344
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:21,551
No.

345
00:21:21,551 --> 00:21:25,210
And actually that's more on that after
the break because what ends up happening

346
00:21:25,211 --> 00:21:29,380
and where the cool revelations of the
series is the way in which Bernie actually

347
00:21:29,381 --> 00:21:30,490
sees himself

348
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:35,590
as a victim and it's here where the
story sort of starts to expand beyond him

349
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:40,480
and you start to sort of see the
much bigger field of play. Yeah.

350
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,710
That's coming up after the break.

351
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:47,400
This is Alicia bridges calling
from Saskatoon in Saskatchewan.

352
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:52,520
Radiolab is supported in part by the
Alfred p Sloan Foundation enhancing public

More information
aboutSloan@wwwdotsloan.org

355
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,760
hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm
Robert Krulwich Radiolab. Today,

356
00:22:08,761 --> 00:22:13,110
we're playing a series of excerpts from
a brand new series from audible called

357
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:17,070
Ponzi supernova comes from reporter
Steve Fishman and Ellen Horn,

358
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:21,480
our former executive producer. And
uh, it's a series about Bernie Madoff,

359
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:24,440
the largest financial
fraud in history. Uh,

360
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,920
it's sort of a behind the scenes look.

361
00:22:25,921 --> 00:22:30,921
And in this series there's lots
of really kind of crazy frankly,

362
00:22:31,741 --> 00:22:36,741
descriptions of how Bernie Madoff and
his team pulled it off and how on many

363
00:22:38,131 --> 00:22:41,220
occasions they almost got
caught for me, right? A US

364
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:41,611
attorney,

365
00:22:41,611 --> 00:22:46,260
Matthew Schwartz told me about one
of the closest of the close calls,

366
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:49,680
one starring Frank Dipascali Madoff's top.

367
00:22:49,681 --> 00:22:53,120
Lieutenant Dipascali
testifies that he's, you know,

368
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:57,060
sitting in a conference room with
the auditors. They ask for, uh, this,

369
00:22:57,090 --> 00:23:00,720
this report called us
Siack s I a c report.

370
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:03,810
So picture it a conference
room full of auditors,

371
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:06,330
one asks for this routine report,

372
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:11,040
something a legitimate trading firm
would have on the shelf. Of course,

373
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:15,780
Madoff isn't a legitimate trading firm,
so they don't have it. Think quick,

374
00:23:15,781 --> 00:23:19,860
frank, and be cool in
front of the auditors.

375
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:23,790
Frank phones the computer
programmers and says, Hey,

376
00:23:23,791 --> 00:23:28,650
can you bring up the siack
report? And the guy says,

377
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:32,640
basically the psych report, you told
us we didn't need the psych report,

378
00:23:32,641 --> 00:23:35,250
where the hell am I going to get a
psych report? And he says, great,

379
00:23:35,251 --> 00:23:38,640
I'll see you in 10 minutes,
you know? And then he does,

380
00:23:38,641 --> 00:23:43,500
as he described it, a little soft
shoe to stall for time. Meanwhile,

381
00:23:43,501 --> 00:23:48,501
the team has minutes to a false report
and then make it appear as if it's been

382
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,720
idling on a shelf.

383
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:55,580
They're frantically putting together
and printing out this report,

384
00:23:55,581 --> 00:24:00,050
which is, you know, it's, it's
half a foot thick off for time.

385
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:01,131
Meanwhile,

386
00:24:01,131 --> 00:24:06,131
the team has minutes to prepare a false
report and then make it appear as if

387
00:24:06,531 --> 00:24:08,360
it's been idling on a shelf.

388
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:13,220
They're frantically putting together
and printing out this report,

389
00:24:13,221 --> 00:24:14,170
which is, you know, it's,

390
00:24:14,171 --> 00:24:19,171
it's half a foot thick of this
being paper Dot Matrix paper.

391
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:24,500
And then it's supposed to be a report
that's been lying around for a month and

392
00:24:24,501 --> 00:24:26,180
instead it's hot off the presses.

393
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:31,480
So first they stick it in a refrigerator
that's down in the investment advisory

394
00:24:32,301 --> 00:24:37,040
business to call it off and then
they literally play football with it.

395
00:24:37,041 --> 00:24:41,550
They're tossing it around the room to
one another to make it look weathered and

396
00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:44,080
then they run it up to a
two deep pascal [inaudible],

397
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:49,070
the Pascali. Here's the siack report,
who Cooley hands it to the auditors.

398
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:53,090
There are close calls over and over again.

399
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:58,490
It's fabulous theater. Steve actually
described a Bernie Madoff's operation,

400
00:24:58,710 --> 00:24:58,860
right?

401
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:03,860
You know that created like this massive
$65 billion fraud as like super rickety,

402
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:09,670
basically held together by tape and safety
pins and old dot matrix printers and

403
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:11,121
they're serious.

404
00:25:11,121 --> 00:25:14,360
Goes into a lot of detail about sort
of the mechanics and how it worked.

405
00:25:14,361 --> 00:25:18,260
What caught our attention was the thing
that we sort of mentioned before the

406
00:25:18,261 --> 00:25:20,420
break, this idea that Bernie saw himself,

407
00:25:20,421 --> 00:25:24,410
not as this like all
powerful criminal mastermind,

408
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:27,320
but as kind of a pond. Yeah.

409
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:31,760
There was an original group of investors
that Bernie made up found and this

410
00:25:31,761 --> 00:25:36,350
group is called the big four.
That's exactly right. The big four.

411
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:39,080
They came to be known. Even
Madoff calls them the big four.

412
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:44,160
I had four prime big
clients, Jeffry Picower,

413
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:45,810
Norman Levy,

414
00:25:46,410 --> 00:25:50,160
Carl Shapiro and Stanley Chase,

415
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,500
commonly referred to as the big four.

416
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:58,740
He was very clear that those
accounts in particular Shapiro Levy,

417
00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:04,000
um, pick cower and chase, former
assistant us attorney, Matt Schwartz,

418
00:26:04,001 --> 00:26:09,001
again were handled very differently from
other accounts and were handled it in a

419
00:26:10,511 --> 00:26:12,220
way that, you know,

420
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:15,580
it mattered less if there was
a mistake for these accounts.

421
00:26:15,581 --> 00:26:19,240
The workmanship was quite
different, more demanding,

422
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:21,070
less exacting.

423
00:26:21,370 --> 00:26:26,370
Some employees were more meticulous
than others and some clients you could

424
00:26:26,921 --> 00:26:28,990
afford to be less meticulous with

425
00:26:29,810 --> 00:26:31,910
a net bond. Juno had
been there a long time.

426
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:34,880
She was employee number
one in the Ponzi business.

427
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:38,300
Garfinkel told me she handled
the accounts of the big four.

428
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:42,600
Steve Garfinkel was one of the FBI
agents who investigated Bernie Madoff's

429
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:47,601
operation in nets clients
the way she for gazy their,

430
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,450
uh, account statements.

431
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:54,810
There were some instances
when the customer's got their
accounts statements from

432
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:59,760
net and complained that, oh, am
I, you know, you promised me,

433
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:04,200
uh, you know, 18% and I only got 16%.

434
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:07,560
And they sent the s the
statement back to Annette.

435
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:13,400
So then she would do a new statement
when miraculously you got the,

436
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:15,560
uh, you know,

437
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:19,860
your new statement with the new
higher return made off himself,

438
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:23,300
says the accounts of the
big four were for Gazy.

439
00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:25,430
They were doing all sorts of Schmader,

440
00:27:25,431 --> 00:27:29,060
a trays to Jewish term that we
used where they were, you know,

441
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:33,500
taking Los tres and the, the stuff
that they did was unbelievable.

442
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:36,080
And I were doing it through me. Hey,

443
00:27:36,081 --> 00:27:39,380
demanded Bernie do kinkier maneuvers.

444
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:41,450
Stanley chase for example,

445
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:46,470
there was explicit testimony that he would
not tolerate a single losing trade in

446
00:27:47,671 --> 00:27:48,271
his accounts.

447
00:27:48,271 --> 00:27:53,271
And he had a particular trading strategy
where some times you could have a

448
00:27:53,641 --> 00:27:56,310
losing leg of a trade with the
trade as a whole, as a winner.

449
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:57,750
Cause it was a three legged trade.

450
00:27:57,930 --> 00:28:00,780
He wouldn't even tolerate
that for some reason.

451
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:05,850
Every single trade, every single leg of
every single trade had to be a winner.

452
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:10,230
Well, that doesn't happen in real life
and no one can demand that of their money

453
00:28:10,231 --> 00:28:11,064
manager,

454
00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:12,440
each of the big four,

455
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:16,730
pay back millions and pick ours
casing billions of dollars.

456
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:19,700
Every one of them claimed
Madoff had duped them.

457
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:25,060
They weren't prosecuted
and it's impossible

458
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,910
present return in a good year,

459
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:32,150
but no one has the ability to rewrite
history and turn stocks into bonds.

460
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,540
And so these men, mostly older,

461
00:28:35,541 --> 00:28:40,541
powerful mentors to Madoff open for
me a new door into the Madoff Ponzi

462
00:28:40,671 --> 00:28:41,504
operation.

463
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:46,010
They gave Bernie his break and then
demanded that he provide them things he

464
00:28:46,011 --> 00:28:49,940
couldn't honestly achieve.
These people are these people,

465
00:28:49,941 --> 00:28:51,070
and by that I mean the big four,

466
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:54,800
whether it's them personally or
their lieutenants or whoever it is,

467
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:58,400
they are asking for things
that are not possible, right?

468
00:28:58,610 --> 00:29:01,820
Bernie is accomplishing those
things. So now ask yourself,

469
00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:03,920
who has the power in that relationship?

470
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:07,850
Is it Bernie because he knows he's
doing illegal things for these parties?

471
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:12,860
Or is it the the party who set, who's
now making Bernie do illegal things?

472
00:29:13,850 --> 00:29:18,110
It's both of them were. When
Bernie said to you, gosh, like I,

473
00:29:18,410 --> 00:29:22,940
I discovered that people
are really greedy. Remember
that was in the beginning.

474
00:29:23,210 --> 00:29:26,420
Is this what he means that
these people were using him?

475
00:29:26,810 --> 00:29:28,310
This is what Bernie means. And,

476
00:29:28,370 --> 00:29:33,370
and Bernie has actually a particular
enmity for those big four.

477
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:38,780
One of them, Jeffrey, pick
our, took out $7 billion,

478
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:42,040
$7 billion. This theme right

479
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:45,370
beyond what he invested. That's
Ellen Horn who produced the series.

480
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:50,400
Now the story of Jeffry Picower is one
of the more dramatic moments in the

481
00:29:50,811 --> 00:29:51,310
series.

482
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:53,600
What's going on? Collab.

483
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:00,230
[inaudible]

484
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:04,760
10 months after Bernie Madoff's
arrest, Barbara Picower wife of Madoff,

485
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:08,150
the largest investor, Jeffry
Picower dialed nine [inaudible]

486
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:13,310
there is at the bottom of the pools at
the bottom of the pool that boom, okay.

487
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:17,660
This call was hard to
listen to. It's upsetting.

488
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,850
Okay. See, I'm a lot, I'm gonna start
the medics. You don't hang up. Okay.

489
00:30:21,851 --> 00:30:23,730
I'm going to put your
tickets away for charter.

490
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:30,030
The fact that Jeffry Picower had a
heart attack and drown in his pool.

491
00:30:30,031 --> 00:30:31,800
You can congratulate me on that.

492
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:33,600
[inaudible]

493
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:37,920
according to Madoff, the fort pick
out where it went for his final swim.

494
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:39,553
Bernie phoned him.

495
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:44,940
I called up Jeffrey pick
ours and you know, I said,

496
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:47,490
you got to give him
the money back. I said,

497
00:30:47,491 --> 00:30:51,090
you guys owe me money and
I want the money back.

498
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:55,140
Pick hours, you know, sit there. Well,
you know, I don't have it all I did.

499
00:30:55,141 --> 00:30:59,410
I said, Jeffrey, I know that
you have the money there is,

500
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:02,730
you're worth $9 billion
and I want 7 billion back.

501
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:08,510
Consider what made offs tone regarding
the death of someone he knew for decades.

502
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:12,020
What this says about
Bernie Madoff, who he is,

503
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:16,910
whenever someone hears that I interviewed
Madoff, they always want to know,

504
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:19,190
does Bernie feel remorse?

505
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:25,970
I've interviewed serial killers, child
rapists, people considered monsters.

506
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:28,610
I suspended judgment.

507
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:33,020
I wanted to hear their
stories to understand them.

508
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:36,440
This doesn't mean I wasn't
horrified by what I heard,

509
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:41,120
but I tried to see the world through
their eyes and exercising empathy.

510
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:44,720
At times I feel empathy for Bernie,

511
00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:50,540
but here's what struck me about
Bernie. He didn't feel empathy.

512
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:54,470
He claimed to feel remorse.
He mouthed the words,

513
00:31:54,471 --> 00:31:56,630
but there was always a button.

514
00:31:57,030 --> 00:32:01,980
Oh, a lot of my clients get a fiddle
with every penny they put in there,

515
00:32:02,910 --> 00:32:05,950
please poverty, don't let me up.
Excuse me. What I did, I mean,

516
00:32:05,970 --> 00:32:08,320
I don't feel sorry for you.

517
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:12,210
You have a certain to
be a client. I would.

518
00:32:12,211 --> 00:32:15,990
They were told Time and
time again that you know,

519
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:20,520
stop put more than 50% of
their marketable right.

520
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:23,160
With justice with me and with the odd,

521
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:25,690
all that combination and all
their statements, they saw it.

522
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:29,910
There were things that they sign that
basically they do that this kind of

523
00:32:29,911 --> 00:32:34,440
trading is speculative. Eventually
they had doubts. They had doubts.

524
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:38,140
[inaudible]

525
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:40,070
on the phone with me every

526
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:42,950
single time Bernie mentions victims,

527
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:47,270
he can barely get through the
apology before interrupting himself.

528
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:51,860
They were warned. They were
greedy. Always this strange, sorry,

529
00:32:51,861 --> 00:32:52,700
not sorry.

530
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:56,070
Yeah. I said brokerage firms can fail.

531
00:32:56,520 --> 00:33:01,010
I could go crazy and do
something stupid. I said,

532
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:05,400
it's, you know, if you
want a guarantee, you know,

533
00:33:05,401 --> 00:33:07,380
put your money in government bonds.

534
00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:13,300
It's impossible to tell the story of
the fall of the house of Madoff without

535
00:33:13,301 --> 00:33:16,930
understanding that there were
real victims. Real suffering.

536
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:22,500
Back in early 2009 victims were telling
stories of their ruined lives on TV,

537
00:33:24,491 --> 00:33:27,880
on the radio, on every local talk show,

538
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:30,830
there was the worst thing
that ever happened to us. This

539
00:33:31,450 --> 00:33:33,440
can't be real. We have lost everything.

540
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:38,210
I have lost everything and you've lost
everything. Everything that we worked for

541
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:44,200
goes down the drain at the end

542
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:46,593
and dumpsters.

543
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:51,630
Now, of course, you listened
to them. They're old.

544
00:33:51,631 --> 00:33:54,780
They're living at a dumpsters
and they're, uh, they, you know,

545
00:33:54,781 --> 00:33:57,050
they don't have any money. It's
on its own and I'm sure it's a,

546
00:33:57,070 --> 00:34:01,290
it's a traumatic experience
for some, but you know,

547
00:34:01,291 --> 00:34:02,970
I made a lot of money for a lot of people.

548
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:08,380
Did you catch the remorse or was it
too fleeting to register in your brain?

549
00:34:09,050 --> 00:34:13,640
My producers and I were in touch with
dozens of victims to the victims.

550
00:34:13,850 --> 00:34:17,840
Bernie's indifference was
in raging all over again,

551
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:20,660
but it wasn't the
slightest bit surprising.

552
00:34:21,650 --> 00:34:26,650
What is surprising is what happened to
victims since Madoff dragged their $65

553
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:33,380
billion down a dark hall. I mean
there is now, this is eight,

554
00:34:33,410 --> 00:34:34,430
nine years later,

555
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:39,530
there is an industry that is
created around the Madoff collapse.

556
00:34:39,950 --> 00:34:44,840
There are hundreds of lawyers
working on recovering money,

557
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:50,120
and that's a very complicated story.
And, and when we try and tell,

558
00:34:50,121 --> 00:34:51,080
because you know what,

559
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:56,440
a lot of people who lost money
didn't have any inclination,

560
00:34:56,751 --> 00:34:59,870
couldn't have had any inkling
that this was going on.

561
00:34:59,871 --> 00:35:04,220
So the justice group comes in,
private lawyers, courts, judges,

562
00:35:04,221 --> 00:35:07,910
the Justice Department, and
they tried to make amends,

563
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:12,890
have they, justice is a
fairly complicated issue.

564
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:15,890
And the universe created by Bernie Madoff.

565
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:21,470
You have a trustee appointed
to recover funds for victims.

566
00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:21,951
Well,

567
00:35:21,951 --> 00:35:26,951
some of those funds went to people
who took those funds in good faith.

568
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:31,190
They'd given Burnie millions of dollars.

569
00:35:31,191 --> 00:35:33,680
They took out a million plus one.

570
00:35:34,070 --> 00:35:36,260
And so they thought they
were doing the right thing.

571
00:35:36,261 --> 00:35:38,040
They thought it was their money,

572
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:43,130
but we've got to give money back to the
people who lost more money than they put

573
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:46,320
in. You're going to have to
give some of your money to them.

574
00:35:46,321 --> 00:35:49,530
So it's a very complicated
moral universe. Well,

575
00:35:49,531 --> 00:35:54,531
there's the individuals and then in the
last category there are the banks and

576
00:35:54,931 --> 00:35:59,931
the investment institutions that sold
Bernie to ordinary people all over the

577
00:36:01,411 --> 00:36:04,650
world. Yeah, there are these
financial institutions,

578
00:36:04,890 --> 00:36:09,270
hedge funds raised billions of dollars,
took them to Latin America, to Europe,

579
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:14,630
all across the United States market
and in Bernie Madoff as a safe bet.

580
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:15,991
You know,

581
00:36:15,991 --> 00:36:20,991
he was weaponized by the financial system
and so we wondered why weren't those

582
00:36:21,811 --> 00:36:26,811
hedge funds accountable for not doing
their job and this is the still still

583
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:28,470
happening. Still

584
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:33,000
unraveling. Still needs to be
reported part of the story. Absolutely

585
00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:38,190
[inaudible]

586
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:43,190
that question about why the people who
quote weaponized Bernie Madoff haven't

587
00:36:43,951 --> 00:36:46,170
been punished yet probably
will never be punished.

588
00:36:46,770 --> 00:36:50,400
That is something that Ellen Horn and
Steve Fishman tackle in the final episode

589
00:36:50,490 --> 00:36:53,100
in their series. And we
definitely recommend you check it
