00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:08.490
Behind the scenes of every movie you love,
years of planning have gone in to making sure

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.150
that every line, prop and camera angle are
exactly what the filmmakers want.

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:17.240
The crazy thing about movie making, though,
is that sometimes, even with all that planning,

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:22.050
the filmmakers and actors decide to toss out
the script and improvise instead.

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.850
Sometimes this can be disastrous, but sometimes
these unplanned moments turn out to be seriously

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:27.850
awesome.

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:31.989
For this video, we are taking a look at some
of the best for our list of 10 Improvised

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:35.200
Movie Scenes That Made Actors React Out Of
Nowhere.

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:59.660
The Wolf Of Wall Street
Matthew McConaughey had himself a pretty good

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:00.920
2013.

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.630
Not only did he take home the Best Actor Oscar
for Dallas Buyers Club, he also delivered

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.300
a quick but quality performance in The Wolf
Of Wall Street.

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:17.000
Fans loved the scene where McConaughey was
banging his chest, and as it turns out, this

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.549
is something that the actor made up on the
spot.

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:23.740
The ritual was actually something McConaughey
would do before shooting, and he decided that

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.780
he would bring it into the scene.

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.870
DiCpario is a world-class actor, but you can
totally see him cracking up, and even looking

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:36.420
over to the camera crew as McConaughey’s
chest beating and humming escalates.

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.460
Zoolander
While 2016’s Zoolander sequel was an absolute

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:45.740
travesty, the original film is actually quite
hilarious and is jam packed with fun unscripted

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.320
moments.

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.600
In one scene involving David Duchovny and
leading man, Ben Stiller, Duchovny’s character

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.259
is explaining how the fashion industry has
been behind every high profile political assassination

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:57.729
of the last hundred years.

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:02.409
Stiller’s Zoolander asks, “Why male models?”
which prompts Duchovny to give a long and

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:03.909
clear explanation.

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:12.450
Stiller then stares right at him and again
asks “Why male models?”

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.540
As it turns out, this moment happened because
Stiller actually forgot his line and just

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.230
opted to repeat his previous one.

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:19.230
This prompted Duchovny to ad-lib his response
“Are you kidding?

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:20.230
I just told you like a minute ago.”

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.760
The scene was totally unplanned but thanks
to Duchovny’s great reaction, it ends up

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.819
fitting in perfectly!

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:28.180
The Dark Knight
The Dark Knight is still regarded as one of

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.540
the best superhero movies of all time and
Heath Ledger’s Joker performance has become

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:37.290
even more iconic as the years go on.

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:44.390
It is well known that Ledger threw himself
deep into the role and this led to some pretty

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.510
amazing unscripted moments.

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:53.040
A lot of people know about the improvisation
in the scene where the Joker blows up the

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.300
hospital, but there is also a great-unscripted
moment from when the clown prince is locked

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:58.800
up behind bars.

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.269
As the officers in the room applaud Commissioner
Gordon’s promotion, Ledger begins, totally

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:05.750
off script, to slowly clap – never changing
his facial expression and staring through

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.650
the prison bars with a truly terrifying look.

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.629
It was just a simple improvisation but it
totally changed the vibe of the scene and

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:15.760
has become an iconic moment from the film.

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.930
The Silence of The Lambs
Even though he had less than 25 minutes of

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:24.069
screen time in the movie, Anthony Hopkins
performance as Hannibal Lecter is still one

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:26.959
of the most bone chilling portrayals of all
time.

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:31.660
Even with such little screen time, Hopkins
found ways to improvise some truly creepy

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:32.660
moments.

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:36.500
In one scene, Dr. Hannibal Lecter is in the
middle of telling a story to FBI agent Foster’s

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.849
Clarice about his cannibalistic ventures.

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:43.951
At the end of this story, Hopkins decided
to add-lib a truly haunting hiss sound that

00:03:43.951 --> 00:03:46.209
is now an iconic part of his character.

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:50.280
Apparently, this was something that Hopkins
would do often between scenes to try to spook

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.650
Foster, so when he brought the hiss in to
the scene, the terror on Foster’s face is

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:58.769
totally genuine.

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:02.350
Fast &amp; Furious 6
The Fast &amp; Furious movies have brought us

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:05.940
some of the best over the top action scenes
in recent memory.

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:11.069
But, hidden between scenes of cars doing back
flips are some pretty well acted moments featuring

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:12.620
a talented cast.

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.870
Fans were excited when The Rock joined the
franchise, but who would have known that he

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.840
would deliver the best-improvised moment from
the entire series.

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.400
In the sixth film, The Rock is walking up
to join the group and Tyrese Gibson’s character

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:23.400
starts to chirp him.

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:24.400
Instead of sticking to the script, The Rock
decided to chirp back by saying “You better

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:25.400
hide that big ass forehead!”

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.640
The best part about this improvised line is
Ludacris’ genuine reaction as he spits his

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:31.640
drink out all over the place.

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:35.020
The Godfather
The Godfather is one of the most loved films

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:42.710
of all time and Marlon Brando’s performance
as Vito Corleone is truly iconic.

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:46.950
Brando does an amazing job of crafting a multi
dimensional character that is so much more

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:48.810
than just a ruthless mob boss.

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:52.950
One of the most memorable scenes comes when
Brando is delivering some brutal orders - all

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:55.830
while gently, albeit maniacally, stroking
a cat.

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:00.030
The crazy thing about this is, the cat was
never part of the original script.

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:04.600
The origin story of the cat is spotty, some
reports say that the director plopped the

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:09.610
feline into Brando's lap just before filming
began and other reports say Brando found the

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:13.220
famous feline roaming around the set and decided
to use him.

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:17.250
Whatever the case may be, an unplanned cat
definitely adds an interesting dynamic to

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:20.200
any film shoot.

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:23.850
The Empire Strikes Back
The Star Wars films are known for a lot of

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:27.390
things, but they definitely aren’t what
comes to mind first when you think of great

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:28.920
improvised lines.

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:32.850
That being said, Harrison Ford brought his
special blend of charming and cocky to the

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:41.130
iconic role of Han Solo and he’s been a
fan favorite ever since.

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:45.220
As it turns out, one of Ford’s most famous
lines was actually improvised by the actor

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:46.500
on the spot.

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:50.710
In a scene where the script required him to
show some compassion, Solo was supposed to

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:53.220
respond, “I love you too” to Princess
Leia.

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:57.900
Ford didn’t like how the line felt, so George
Lucas told him to just say whatever he felt

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:02.190
fit best and the actor decided to go with
“I Know”, which is a probably the most

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:06.750
Han Solo answer to “I Love You” that we
could imagine.

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:09.730
Trainwreck
Trainwreck was one of the most hilarious movies

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:15.830
of 2015 and featured some great performances
by Amy Schumer, Bill Hader and even John Cena.

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:18.170
One actor that was surprisingly funny in the
film was NBA superstar, Lebron James.

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:19.170
A lot of the movie was improvised and it turns
out that Hader and Schumer were trying to

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:20.510
trip Lebron up and making him laugh with their
improvised responses.

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:24.540
In one scene, Lebron is trying to convince
the couple to take a trip to Cleveland and

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:29.670
when Hader and Schumer start rapid firing
improvised zingers at him, he has a hard time

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:30.670
handling them.

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:34.810
Lebron hangs on longer than we would have
expected but ultimately breaks down laughing

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:36.476
when Schumer gets him to profess his genuine
love for Cleveland.

00:06:36.476 --> 00:06:41.100
It’s a scene that can only be seen in the
extra features, but it’s totally worth it!

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:42.100
The Departed
Martin Scorsese’s film, The Departed, is

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:43.100
a must see for anyone who considers themselves
a fan of movies.

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:47.060
The story of Boston crime family was stuffed
with incredible actors like Matt Damon, Jack

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:56.720
Nicholson, Leonardo DiCaprio and many more.

00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:01.220
Scorsese did a great job directing this film,
but there were some moments that even he couldn’t

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:02.570
take credit for.

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:07.250
In an intense scene opposite Leo about uncovering
a rat in the group, Nicholson decided to take

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:09.220
things into his own hands.

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:13.190
Even though it wasn’t in the script, Nicholson
pulls a gun out from under the table and this

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:19.870
move totally changed the tone of the scene.

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:24.650
DiCaprio is visibly rattled by the Nicholson
power move and it only adds to the authenticity

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:25.880
of the moment.

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:31.630
Kudos to Leo for just rolling with Nicholson’s
decision and delivering such a great scene.

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:36.130
Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows Pt. 2
The Harry Potter movies have some of the most

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:40.800
devoted fans in the world and they will go
to extreme lengths to defend every aspect

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:42.460
of the wizarding world.

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:47.020
That being said, there is one scene that makes
even the biggest Potterhead cringe and that

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:50.980
is the moment when Voldermort and Malfoy share
an incredibly awkward hug.

00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:55.370
According to Tom Felton, this uncomfortable
moment was totally improvised and caught the

00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:57.410
cast totally off guard.

00:07:57.410 --> 00:08:01.190
While they were filming the scene, Ralph Fiennes,
who plays Voldermort in the series, decided

00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:05.400
to hug Felton and the actor’s reaction of
stopping dead in his tracks and looking very

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:08.310
confused is totally genuine.

00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:13.460
So there you have it, there is our list of
10 improvised movie scenes that forced actors

00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:15.210
to react on the spot.

00:08:15.210 --> 00:08:17.350

favorite?

00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:21.780
